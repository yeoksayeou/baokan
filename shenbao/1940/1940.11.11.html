<p>社評</p>
<h3>慢性痼疾的泰越糾紛</h3>
<p>據連日消息：糾纏已歷兩月的泰越糾紛，最近愈趨惡化；雙方防軍都紛紛向邊境移動，國界業經封鎖，且已有小衝突的發生。另據未經證實的消息：則越南日軍現正向泰國談判駐兵或假道，而日方駐越代表角田又曾於本月二日向越督德古抗議西貢方面的「反日」趨勢。綜合上述種種情勢，足徵南亞大局正孕育着新的危機，泰越的糾紛，適有如其間的一個致命的癌腫。</p>
<p>此「糾紛暴露始於九月十三日，正是日越交涉遷延未決，日方調動兵力對法越實行威迫的時候：泰方突向法國駐泰公使提出照會，要求三事：一，勘割湄公河最深處爲國界，以前法國允予劃歸泰方之泰國失地四十三小島實行劃歸泰國；二，泰人集居之鑾帕邦及北沙一部地方劃歸泰國；三，如法政府無力統治越南時泰政府請求歸還以前所失之老撾地力。泰方並表示如法越當局不予圓滿答覆，則將廢棄本年六月十二日雙方締結的法泰互不侵犯協定。彼時法越正苦於應付日方要求，對於泰國僅能力事敷衍拖延，而泰方則劍拔弩張，以備戰相威嚇。直到日越交涉暫告段落之後，維希方面始於十月十四日提出覆文，根據一九零七年兩國條的中關於避免提出任何有關土地之新要求的規定，拒絕泰方領土要求，並表示即將批准對泰互不侵犯條的，但允根據不侵協定條文之規定組立混合委員會，以便解決有關湄公河問題。而泰方反法越的羣衆運動亦遂於十月中旬達到如火如荼的形態。最近越南法軍司令馬丁將軍去職返國，由泰首相邀的之於歸程中，前往曼谷會談，這似乎是泰方覓取解決途徑的側面運用；而法國方面因爲他的駐泰公使主張接受泰方要求，乃下令召之歸國，則又表示法國態度的堅決，絕鮮讓步餘地。最近雖然維希特使卡隆曾赴曼谷進行接洽，並有樂觀表示，但縱觀日來發展，卻不見有何解決的徵象。際此南太平洋風雲日形緊張之際，此一糾紛之持久不決，無論對於法越泰國以及於南亞具有密切利害關係的各國，都是一件很大的不幸；只有企圖漁利者，惟恐其不亂。綜觀所謂印度支那半島，雖分爲越南暹羅緬旬三部分，然其面積不過百萬方公里，而其間民族的紛歧，歷史的複雜，絕不比歐洲的波羅的海沿岸或巴爾幹半島簡單；而其間邦國離合的演進，領土隸屬的遞嬗，即在歷史學者，亦復感覺繁難；是以關於此項領土問題的爭執，實難斷言其根本是非：値此遠東危機四伏之際，絕小是解決此種歷史糾紛的適當時機。泰人念念不忘失地的觀念，原本値得同情，但此項領土之割讓，迄今已近四十年，已往對法且有不再提出領土要求的的言，但判最近，忽爾視此爲不復能容忍的問題，必欲立即達到復土目的者，這自然內因泰政府厲行國家主義政策。外以法國敗衂之餘，聲威隳地，此外則更由於泰國多年深相結納的「友邦」，正在對法越橫施壓迫，泰國對法越的領土要求，即使小是其「友邦」所唆使，亦必獲其有力贊助俾與之相互呼應，藉脅迫法越，以遂其囊括越南的大慾。是以泰國於此所扮演的客觀任務，正有類蘇台德交涉中的波蘭與匈牙利，而泰國自身的處境及其前途，允酷似當日的波蘭。平心而論，泰方對於危機四伏的當前情勢，當然不致毫無覺悟，有如最近泰國特使團曾往日本進行接洽，並據聞『其所進行之事務，已獲優異成績」；但適在同時，泰司法部長則另率領五人之使節團，歷訪英領馬來半島與緬甸印度以及澳洲，推進其親善使命，此兩使節團之分途接洽日英，適足說明泰當局之苦心孤詣，要在法國潰敗之後，在印度支那半島，更於日央之間，重新建立新的均勢。又如前此泰國擬議參加三國同盟的消息，日軍利用泰境以進攻緬旬公路的傳說，泰當局都立即加以否認，表示自身之中立立塲。由此類推，足徵所謂日軍即有在泰駐軍或假道的企圖，泰方爲了自身的安全，亦未必輕易予以允諾。但如果目前對法越糾紛持久不決，甚或見之兵戎，則第三者必不免藉口『東亞新秩序』而採取進一步的行動；此種主張，日前已公然喧騰之於某方報章。是以泰國上下之堅持索土要求，適證明爲絕大的不智。</p>
<p>從另一角度來看，法越當局之於維護越南領土主權的完整，前此已完全屈服於强梁，而對於泰方比較尙屬合理之要求則決然峻拒，自無以折服泰人。目前除却希望法泰雙方都能體會來日大難，懸岸勒馬，互相讓步，勿爲已甚而外，更望石關　　　　　雙方，試爲仲裁，勿使星星之火、終致燎原　　　　　　　方之幸而已！</p>

<p>工業動員但有一點余可爲諸君吿者、卽德國之產量將爲世界之最大者、因今日吾人所能動員之力量、非德國而已、乃幾達歐洲之全部是也、此項力量余欲向工業方面加以發展諸君可得而信之、數年以來、吾人已準備工業之動員、但大規模之出產、則當俟諸一二年之後、吾人正爲將來而準備、在物質及兵員方面之準備、吾人正在不斷改進世界最特色之軍事機構、待機出擊、以收如前此之宏效、屆時以口舌征服世界之人、將遭遇吾人之武力、德國與其同盟無論如何、足應付世界任何聯合之勢力、無一種力量足以擊敗吾人之勢力、吾人平時之準備現已生果、吾人之四年計劃現又再延長四年、將給吾人無限之給養、此項計劃使任何封鎖歸於失敗、諸君請看何人將被封鎖、是吾人抑敵人、半年前邱吉爾稱、一吾人已擊燬敵人一半之潛艇、再過若干月、敵人所存者將遞减至百分之三十及百分之十、」此項謊言無置辯之價値、現世界已公認吾人之潛艇已日見其多、敵人更無從知其從何而來、吾等尙須與國際資本主義之說謊者相搏鬥、必有一日邱吉爾將失其存在、穗國之潛水艇將在彼處出現、</p>
<p>發動空軍實行空軍戰略乃係邱吉爾之理想、事實上英國之空軍力量又較吾國爲弱、君等皆知余於數年前卽向世界建議應阻止空軍從事轟炸、允其是轟炸平民、但英爾吾行吾素、然則余仍努力於不對平民作戰、如波蘭戰爭時、余卽未向波蘭城市施行夜襲、僅在白晝轟炸其軍事目標而已、挪威·比利時·荷蘭·法國·歷决戰役、德機亦僅以軍事設備爲目標、英相邱吉爾乃於英國空軍未能於白　侵入德境之後、突然實行夜襲、轟炸德國之平民、余靜觀敵機在萊茵河一帶轟炸平民歷八日之久、當西綫戰事結束之後、余曾再向英國表示態度、但德國遭遇轟炸益烈、哈里法克斯已如癲在之人、其後轟炸日甚一日、余則仍持觀望態度、余之僚屬曾多决問余將容忍至何時、彼等決不致自動停止云、余靜觀三月之後、實已不能容忍、乃於某日發表如下之命令曰、英國需要轟炸、英國欲以空戰摧毀德國、余今決定以其人之術還治其人、</p>
<p>勝利信念試觀何人將被罹毀　邱吉爾鑄此軍事上之大錯、決非軍人所能爲、余雖非德國數十年甚至數百年來最强毅之人物、但余絕對相信余之成功、堅信此决戰爭德國將如余在國內之奮　、獲得相同之結果、余曾參加上决世界大戰身受勝利者之欺騙、故此决戰爭之結束、不使之與上决相同、是爲余之不可動搖之決心云、</p>
<p>誇陳戰績當去年余向諸君致詞時、德軍方開始與波蘭作戰。結果僅歷十八日、波軍卽一蹶不振、初、他國認爲德波戰事可歷六閱月乃至十閱月之久、德軍之戰鬥力將被消耗殆盡、在此期間、西綫可整軍作戰、一九四〇年夏、西綫之英法聯軍可假道荷比、直向魯爾邊境進逼、遂漸制德國之死命、彼等復預測德國將發生革命、總之彼等以恫嚇之手段欺人已歷多年、以爲德國亦一邱之貉、殊不知德國早有充分之準備矣、去年十一月八日德軍征服波蘭、證明敵人之推測第一事卽未中的、同時證明德國之成功焉、今日余又有數項功績、可以提出報吿者、德軍不僅於數星期內、摧毀西方之敵、並已佔領挪威之一部、可謂自寇克奈斯以達西班牙邊境、已有一堅强團結之陣綫、英國之好大喜功者所懷抱之希望、可謂完全擊碎、彼等企圖切斷德國之重要交通綫、逐漸使德國飢餓絕食、豈料事實適得其反乎、歐陸了解本身之利害後、逐漸動員、與歐陸之敵對抗、德國在數月之中、使歐陸獲得自由、英國企圖使歐洲成爲巴爾幹化、此種計劃今巳不能成爲事實、易言之、英國欲分化或破壞歐洲之組織、而德義兩國之所望、則爲組織歐洲也、</p>
<p>奮鬥到底英國若宜稱「戰爭須予繼續」、余亦認爲無所謂、蓋戰事祗能機續至吾人結束戰爭之時止、君等儘可相信吾人有結束戰爭獲得勝利之把握此外余有不能已於言者、余不擬發表預言是也、何則、設若本年一月一日余預吿英人曰、「（一）德軍將入挪威、英國將不能立足於挪威、（二）今夏英人將不能僑居荷蘭亦不能來到荷蘭、而德人則將佔領之、（三）比利時與法蘭西將完全改觀、或不復存在、英人將衆口一詞詈余爲在人矣、因此余仍抱定不作預言之方針、祇擬吿德國民衆曰、此屆戰事爆發以來、造成空前未有之結果、就此屆戰事陣亡之人數觀察、較一千八百七十年普法戰役時之死亡率爲低、僅及彼時陣亡者之半數耳、張伯倫於一九三八年在慕尼黑向余提出和平建議時、已決心於返回英國後、立卽宜布「余已獲得相當時間、吾人可以擴充軍備，以便襲擊德國矣」、吾人深知目前之休戰、僅係休戰而巳、渠等或希望數年後、余不復爲德國元首、可以再度發動戰事、因此余不可變更之決心、將繼續作戰、獲致明晰之決定、渠等需要戰爭、德國人民將作戰到底、</p>
<p>求達目的一二年後重啟戰端之危機、必須加以消除、德國人民終須和平生存、此項和平將容許渠等工作、而勿使國際之暴徒鼓動他國與德國對抗、而以戰爭爲獲利之策略、余非爲物質利益而作戰、菩人以爲兵凶戰危、耗費吾人之時間與工作能力、倘吾人能繼續工作、余將深感愉快也、國社主義已產生德軍勝利之精神。心理。道德。與物質之先決條件、目前之德軍爲革命之軍隊、德國軍人不僅追念過去之德國、且渴望未來之德國、渠等作戰爲實現更好之德國、完成吾人之國家與社會之運動、</p>
<p>追念先烈</p>
<p>德國目前之成就、均係一九二三年起事者及犧牲者所賜與、渠等首先爲國社運動流血、此後十年間、國內外革命志士追隨十六先烈之後、爲國犧牲者不下數百人、而奧地利與蘇台德之奮鬥允爲壯烈、此項奮鬥均起源於一九二三年十一月八日與九日、吾人誠擎紀念諸先烈、並實現諸先烈之遺志、德國在目前之歐戰將獲最後之勝利云、（丸日海通社電）</p>
<h3>日軍佔領南寗時　外籍教士　對外往來　被隔絕　函件書籍雜誌等均被扣留　法王敎漠然不知法國現狀</h3>
<p>南寗　日軍盤踞南寗期間、對居留城內之外籍傳敎士、備施壓力、絕對禁與外間通聲息、所有往來函電及各種報導性之書籍雜誌、均被扣留、越南問題發生時、日軍竟目天主堂法籍主敎沈世杰、神父彭鈞毅·唐寓球等爲俘虜、滇緬路開放時、又將福音堂英籍牧師歐顯光、及該堂附風醫院英籍醫生黃抉民、橫加侮辱、彼等十一個月來生活、如處牢獄、行動失　由、記者往訪沈主敎與談法國戰敗、越南被侵等事、渠尙一無所知、聞言不禁泣下、按沈氏在縣城淪陷時、曾在天主堂收容義民三百六十人、而福香堂牧師亦收容百三十餘人、直至華軍入城時、此輩義民仍安居堂內、各道熱腸、至堪欽敬、（十日電）</p>
<p>（刦後南寗城市一瞥）</p>
<p>南寗在一般讀者的想像中、南寗經過十一個月零六天的鐵蹄踐踏、經過失陷時和克復時兩度砲火的摧殘、最後經過敗退的日人之破壞和焚燒、一定不成樣子了、同時在另外一般讀者的想像中、以爲南寗是桂南唯一的大城市、在日人相當長時期的統制之下、已經變成一座走私省大碼頭、日人爲了保證其貨物的傾銷、爲了招致奸商的趨附、會把市面裝扮得花枝招展、會把順民麻醉得像牛羊一樣的馴服、縱使在日人退出的時候、免不了一塲糟蹋、然百足之蟲、死而不僵、精華雖損、塲面總還存在着的、因此、在一般讀者的想像中、克復後的南寗、一定還是相當的繁榮、卽使有點冷落、也可立卽恢復、這兩種想法、在常理上講、是不錯的、記者和其他一切的旅客們、在進入南寗之前、都曾如此想過、以爲總不出上述的兩點、但事實上目下的南寗、部以第三種的姿態出現了、空洞敗落荒冷、便是這種姿熊的切當的寫照、</p>
<p>是的在任憑一個什麽時候、早晨中午或者是黃昏、當你走過中山路。德鄰路。仁愛路。以及其他一切的路、你並不會發現一片瓦礫的景象、更嗅不到繁華的氣息、甚至你也不能遇到一條狗或一頭貓、所看見的祇是一排排蒙塵數寸、高大的、或低矮的、空無所有的房屋、以及一堆堆的垃圾、一羣羣的蒼蠅和紋子、倘若是在夜間、你還會聽到喞喞的蟲聲、和悽厲的鳥叫、這時、你會懷疑你是置身於荒僻的山野間、差不多都是開着的潮濕的地面、浮起了白莓大井裹、長着一兩尺長的茅草，另有些高大院落的門、也完全是開着的、裹面拋滿了空罐頭和字紙、那便是曾經住過日人的地方、</p>
<p>這裹不單是空洞敗落荒凉、在若干街道上和宅院裏、還充溢着恐怖、因爲，當人退去的時候、埋藏了很多的地雷、有的地方他們會故弄玄虛、在地面上掀起一片浮土、揷上一根鐵絲、叫你發生一種危險的驚惶、有些精緻的房屋裏、他們放置着珍貴的食物或其他的東西、誘人去取、事實證明這些地方、是眞有地雷的、某師一位下士班長、在一間屋子的窗口、發現屋裏堆滿了餅干、窗是拴着、門是閉着、但未加鍵、這時他陡牛機智、走開十餘步、伏身地面、用一根長竹竿來推那扇門、砰然一聲響了、門被炸得粉碎、屋裹充滿了烟塵餅于、他笑了、於是在兩分鐘以後、在屋裹撿出了餅干、這可紀念的食物、能者是嘗過的、有一位女同業、還收藏一包、預備回去送親友、</p>
<p>現在我們進城一週後的現在、情形改變了、各街道、各院落的穢物、已部份的打掃潔凈、經過工兵普遍的收索、每一家門首、都寫了（危險物已淸除）的白字、有的店鬥在開始粉刷、有的在門板上寫着某人已經回來，或請某人趕快回家等等字句、這都是些熱情的、然而含有辛酸意味的招喚、</p>
<p>南寗在十天前是鬼蜮世界、在一週前是一座死城、經過幾千個男女健兒的輸血、已開始在恢復着、十二月二十八日以後的南寗、除了避居在天主堂和福音堂的五百十數名義民外、全城再沒有一個中國人、這是任何被日侵佔城市所沒有的現象、</p>
<p>日人驅逐了南寗城區的市民、同時亦窒息了他自己、因爲在南寗城我不到一點東西吃、由於士兵的病息頻仍、縱有東西、也不敢吃、因此一切食物、甚至水、也靠海外的接濟、</p>
<p>被驅逐了的市民、到那裹去了呢、所謂日人的特殊統治、是統治這座　嗎、原來日人叉另闢一個（新省會）、那地方是在南寗西北十三公里地應心墟、這地方並不大、然而他却成了南寗的替身、成了日人統治南寗的政治中心與經濟中心、所有被驅逐出南寗的市民、部禁囚在那裏、供日人的嘲弄、</p>
<p>心墟位於邕江北岸、邕武路西面與邕武路的三塘東西平行、墟內有百餘楝民房、和兩排房屋、兩排墟柵、形成一條的街道、墟的四週圍、繞着鐵絲網、據說在他的繁華散代街上、甚麼東西都有賣、日貨充斥、有很多奸商走私、都在那裹成交易、日人卵翼下的武力、是担任武裝送貨的、</p>
<p>心墟是南寗日人的政治中心和經濟中心、那麼南寗就是日人的軍事中心、事實上就是如此、在驅逐市民以後的南寗、是只准屯駐軍隊、不准經營任何商業、在南寗域區、除三五家供士兵游樂的料理所。酒肆。咖啡座以及慰安所的五百名軍妓外、所有藉軍事庇護、來經營商業的日籍商人、其交易所也只限於心墟、（當然心墟的消化量小得可憐、而不托南寗城、這說明甚麽、這甚說明日人於繁榮南寗城區計劃失敗之後、已不復重視桂南佔領區的市塲性、這也就是後來日人退出桂南戰塲之經濟的背面因索、（十日中央社劉竹舟電）</p>

<h3>男女相愛之原理</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>生殖線之繁榮爲最要</p>
<p>女相愛之原理。可說由於生理上及精神上之融合而來，如生殖機關之發育不全，則對於性慾亦失健全，生殖機能之目的，在使男子之精虫與女子之卵子相結合，而生殖新個體，而欲達男女相愛之原理，即在於斯。然仔細觀察人類。性欲與生殖機關之發育，共間亦甚不調和，蓋人類之有變愛與性慾感覺。遠在其生殖機關成熟之前，彼生育機關尙未發育成熟之兒童，對於異性，已屢屢起其戀愛之情，此即可見也。以生殖機關尙未成熟之兒童，即知戀愛異性，亦爲奇怪現象，故兒童爲手淫者，全不足怪。然與身心之健康大受影響，此由於生殖機關尙未成熟，即行其性行爲所致。</p>
<p>在發育之時，苟犯手淫，或縱慾無度，則生殖腺大受創傷，結果遂患遺精滑精等症，早婚亦然，此種人在正當之性生活時，病態百出，其爲吾人所常知者，即早洩，陰痿，發育不全等症均是。息此者，和好之婚姻每被破壞，故在發育時應善爲檢束，母自放蕩，如感身體衰弱，健康水準低下，應有德國生殖腺素製劑男用「補體康」補之。蓋「補體康」之成分完全採自動物之生殖腺，用科學方法提出其精素，並摻入有益於人體之礦植物成分複製而成，具有補腦，補血，補腎，補精之坊用。如因手淫斵傷，一服該劑，即可恢復原來之壯健，保證廿四小時即生精補腎，老年人服此，有返老還童之功，其女用「補體康」爲治月經不調，貧血早衰之特效良藥，實爲健康之至寳！</p>
<h3>自瀆縱欲的治騐</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆醫師</p>
<p>患者凌其春，年二十五歲，義波人，服務於某飯店。（自訴）因本人意志薄弱，十七歲時，已犯上手淫，久之成習，旋遺精頻繁，面色蒼白。後又與同鄉某蕩婦私姘，致身體愈形狼狽，現雖拆離，而已罹患腎虧等病。（病象）食慾不振，每星期有遺精三四决，頭腦朦朧，早洩，局部短小。（治法）每日電療十五分鐘，服「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精，並令積極購服以睾丸精質製劑「補體康」以培補虧損，而治療神經衰弱，及腎虧等症，連服一月，頓覺都鬧清爽，精神振作，遺精巳止。至第二月，食慾亢進，面色紅潤，早洩絕無，至第三月，諸症全消，檢視體重，已增九磅，而勃起力强大，照理已可停服，凌君鑒於「補體康」之補力偉大，故仍續服以培補虧損，共計服半年，體重可達一百十八磅，凌君未治療前體重僅一〇一磅。</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（二）　法蘭西的大悲劇</h3>
<p>自五月十六日起，英軍當局對於聯軍總司令部卽覺憤慨。魏剛將軍接任之時，英軍參謀長艾恩賽將軍雖曾表示接受，但曾聲明說，形勢嚴重，不得不考慮自由行動，以保全法蘭德一帶的英軍。五月二十日，德軍已有裝甲師五師和機械化部隊若干師渡過繆斯河，那時艾恩賽德將軍正自法返倫敦，在陸軍部中和參謀人員舉行會議。法國軍事聯絡員數人坐在鐵床上面，旁邊就是艾恩賽將軍的辦公桌，無非是要夢寐也不離開地圖和電話。艾恩賽將軍的大皮靴也放在床脚邊，以便隨時穿着。法蘭德地圖舖在桌上，兩旁放着兩張照片：一張是艾恩賽夫人的玉照，一張是將軍綺年玉貌的令媛之像。艾恩賽將軍卽在此時此地，決定沿索美河大舉反攻。法國軍官都頷首同意，且說勃朗沙將軍的機械化師團，和第一軍的一部份可在左翼協助進攻。</p>
<p>德軍旣無後顧之憂，便一刻不停的準備進攻索末河陣錢。魏剛從第一天起，就稱此役爲「法蘭西之戰」。五月二十九日，內閣舉行會議，他公開表示索末河之役，已是最後一戰，他準備調用一切後備隊，動員所有的人力物力，以作孤注一擲。此後決不能再有退却。魏剛向各部長解釋道：「在近代戰爭中，退却的軍隊就是一個失敗的軍隊，因爲追軍比退軍前進得更快。後退不能保全軍器，也不能維持連續不斷的戰綫。近代戰爭中不退則已，一退便不可收拾。」</p>
<p>六月一日，邱吉爾飛抵巴黎參與聯軍最高會議時，魏剛曾重述此言。他壓迫邱吉爾作更大的援助。六月四日鄧扣克失守，决日黎明，德軍在索末河上的大攻勢就開始實行了。</p>
<p>第一天，法軍雖在猛烈無比的砲火下，仍能堅守全綫。魏剛表示滿意。萊諾以「一綫希望」爲廣播題目。六月六日，大多數法國人依然相信法國方面必能冉造一决歷史上的奇蹟，阻止敵軍，獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>萊諾同時剷除內閣中一切軟弱分千，先從達拉第下手。他提拔鮑多恩爲外交决長，又舉五十歲的特戈爾將軍爲陸軍部决長，鮑多恩是一個具有極大潛勢力的幕後人物，他出入政商兩界，已有五十年之久，從未沾染政界的惡習。特戈兩將軍則始終是機械化裝甲師團和攻勢空軍的信徒，晋授將軍銜還不過十二天。</p>
<p>但是魏剛將軍視察陣地後，已另擬一種計劃，規模更爲偉大，法蘭德軍隊或可全部得救。爲此，他須調動所有的預備隊當他聽到他所急切需要的軍隊中，有一部份須帮助艾恩賽的作戰計劃，法方畢洛脫將軍也已同意，他不覺頓足痛駡責畢洛脫不應擅自決斷，同時向英軍聲明，法軍另有別用，不能相助，還請他們勿作孤軍淮攻的嘗試，惜乎爲時已遲，英軍的攻勢已經開始了。這種攻勢起初頗爲得手，旋卽遭遇堅强的抵抗，英軍並卽被迫退却，甚至退到原來陣綫之後。</p>
<p>五月二十三日，畢洛脫在耶普爾地方把魏剛計劃吿訴比利時國王利奧波特三世和英軍司令戈特將軍，其內容規定法軍在北，英軍在南，於五月二十六日同時夾攻，以便渡過索末河，使英法兩軍重新取得聯絡。這計劃雖極危險，但恐怕是挽救法國的唯一辦法了。不幸負責指揮北路戰事的畢洛脫將軍，卽在五月爾十八日因汽車肇禍喪生。五月二十五日，比軍也已自北南退，說是德軍壓迫過甚。英軍恐與友軍完全隔離，卽派兵兩師，佔領比國邊境鎭，以便和接替畢洛脫的勃朗沙將軍保持聯絡。勃朗沙吿訴戈特說：「比軍已準備退却」。戈特立卽轉告艾恩賽。艾恩賽卽囑戈特「自行準備。」</p>
<p>英法聯軍開始反攻前數小時，比利時竟吿屈伏。五月二十八日早晨八點鐘，萊諾在廣播無綫電中簡截的報吿說：「比十利奧波特先則乞助於我，今戰事方酣，未向英法有一言半語，卽棄械降敵。鄧扣克要道已經門戶洞開了。」第一批英軍卽開始由里斯河撤退，在奧斯頓和鄧扣免之間登船。法軍獨力難支，也祇得決定設法登船撤退。他們把所有的槍砲輜重，以至機械化師團的機械設備，統統拋棄了。</p>
<p>樂觀空氣繼續到六月九日。這幾天內，萊諾便向羅斯福總統發出第一决呼額電，請求美國幫忙。魏剛甚至在軍令中宣佈：「敵軍損失慘重，已經氣衰力竭，我軍作戰已到最後一刻鐘了。堅持下去吧！」</p>
<p>可是魏剛悉索敝賦，旣調動馬奇諾防綫後方軍隊，且不顧義大利軍的威脅，調動阿爾臬斯出前綫守軍，綜其所有，不過四十個師之衆。德軍人數，却是一天一天有增無已，兵力增到一百師以上，集中於一百哩長的戰錢。德軍在瓦斯河方面有四十師，在索亞松對面有十師，在愛納河上游和香巴臬方面有四十師，據守齊格飛防綫和準備在瑞士邊界採取攻勢的裝甲師團，尙不計在內。</p>
<p>法軍連日連夜，目不交睫的抵禦德軍，戰鬥無時或息，每天早晨終是看到德方生力軍盞湧而來。法軍終於不支潰退了。德軍穿過阿培維爾，該地守軍蘇格蘭軍一師，卽英軍留駐法國的最後一師，也不支潰退了。魏剛絕望之餘，雖圖另建一新陣綫，亦已無濟於事。他便警吿政府，立卽離開巴黎。六月九日晚上，載重車數千輛。紛紛搬運各部重要檔案。政府官吏都挈眷同行。車輛蜿蜓不絕。沒有汽車逃往都兩的，都乘專車而行。甚至總司令部也南移一百二十哩之遙。</p>
<p>六月十日，萊諾偕同魏剛視察前錢。兩天之後，這兩位軍政領袖，回到洛亞河畔白里亞村總司令部。他們爭辯甚烈，最後魏剛說道「一切都已完了。我們必須立卽停戰，方可避免最劣惡的遭遇。」</p>
<p>六月十一日，義大利對法宣戰。但墨索里尼此舉已不是影響事勢的演進，法國方面對之也無動於中。六月十二日，萊諾遄返都爾，拒絕妥協，他說「法蘭西的靈魂尙未消滅呀！」他與貝當促膝長談，想拉住他做同志。但貝當却比魏剛還要堅決，說道：「軍事上旣已不再有望，我們自不得不停止戰爭。」</p>
<p>萊諾搖動電話，請邱吉爾速來，同時召集閣僚，在警察局舉行緊急會議。各部長神情慌亂，急迫異常。他們互相握手，寒暄未竟，又趕着同別人去談話。開會方始，都爾四周的炸彈已雜然大作。</p>
<p>萊諾向閣員宣佈不惜任何代價，作戰到底。芒台爾和特戈爾將軍都表贊同。特戈　甚至建議將政府遷往勃來頓，俾「法軍可在該處憑險據守，且有通海之路，可以獲得海外接濟。」但沒有人贊成這個主張。海軍部長剛秉基和航空部長埃納克則主張遷往北菲殖民地</p>
<p>未幾，貝當卽慢慢的站起來發言道：一這許多言論，皆是無補實際。時乎不再。德軍前進愈深，條件愈苛。乘我們海軍尙屬完整，部份陸軍尙未潰敗，馬奇諾防綫尙未失守的當兒，不如立卽請求休戰。若再蹉跎，我們就得事事聽命於聊勝者了。「情報部長福祿沙和旭當都贊成貝當意見，飽多恩亦然。</p>
<p>討論之際忽然報稱邱吉爾駕到，會議乃暫時中斷。邱吉爾聽了報吿，吃驚異常。他請求道：「再支持四十八小時。明夜我當派遣轟炸機千架來援，並當儘速派遣軍隊軍備。」（兩夜後卽有英國轟炸機五百架，圖阳德軍前進，但無效果。）</p>
<p>夜間叉舉行一决會議，勒勃倫總統親自主持。當時沿街漆黑，難民擁擠。部長們各坐汽車，自都爾蜿蜒駛往數哩外暫作總統府之朗其堡。魏剛踏步進入會議室，面容慘白，神經興奮，在肅靜無聲中發言道</p>
<p>「諸位，站在你們面前的，是一個不名譽的軍人，是一個敗軍之將。我們除了解甲投降外，巳是無法可想。」法國當局諸公聽到這位偉大人物要求停戰之言，都感到所負責任重大，不禁慄慄危懼。福祿沙竟失聲而哭，餘者也淚盈於眶</p>
<p>會議一整夜，僅僅決定宜布巴黎爲不設防城市，以爲縱使竭力防守，也不過使名城化爲焦土，不過阻止德軍一二天而巳。不久都爾亦受威脅，政府決定　度遷徙，卽在六月十四日到波爾多，是H德軍卽長騙入巴黎。（未完）</p>

<h3>如何調整戰時金融</h3>
<p>— 兪燮麟</p>
<p>欲謀戰事勝利，必先鞏固國內經濟；產業之維持，貿易之推進，財政之充裕，資金之管理，物價之控制，此均爲戰時經濟之要策。考諸世界各國，莫不如是。不過欲謀上項政策之有效，必先求金融措置之得當。我國戰爭三載，政府當局對於戰時金融，力求穩定，如限制提存，辦理貼放，改善地方金融，整理地方通貿，統治外滙，提倡　約儲蓄。鼓勵金融機關對工商之貸放，組織四聯總處，擴大金融網，以及限制內匯，管理銀行資金等，觀其措置，可謂詳而當矣。不過因環境關係，終不能充分發揮其效力，使其達金融安定之目的。</p>
<p>我國戰時金融之病態</p>
<p>茲先論我國戰時金融統制之困難：其一，金融組織，尙未臻完善，如小銀行之林立，銀行資金運用之不當，故當局對於金融政策之實施，頗感困難。其二，我國之金融機關以及工商各業，集中於沿海各省，自滬津廣州及漢口等埠相繼放棄後，政府當局對於該處之金融機關及游資問題，未能加以直接而嚴格之統制。其三，後方資金貧乏，富源尙未開發，金融機關尙未遍設，政府當局雖設法補救，增設國家銀行之分支行，擴大金融綱之組織，並鼓勵上海商業銀行之添設分支行，後方銀行之數目，雖已激增，但對於調劑後方金融，開發後方產業，於短時期內，尙難收宏效。</p>
<p>我國戰時金融處在如此環境之下，當然病態叢生。先論游資問題。社會游資，不納於正當之用途，則泛濫於市，爲害甚烈。上海處於苟安局面之下，人口激增，資金亦隨而集中。自歐戰以後，上海游資之泛濫，更爲顯著。蓋昔日之逃避資金，相繼歸回，且南洋一帶之資金，亦紛向上海流來。據上海銀行二十八年度之業務報吿，自歐戰爆發後至去年底止，僅香港一埠流滬之資金，已達十五萬萬元之鉅。由此可知，來滬資金之數目，頗爲可觀。又觀各銀行之業務報吿，定期存款趨减而活期存款激增。更可知現今上海之游資問題，已達嚴重階段。游資之充斥，實非上海金融之福也。</p>
<p>上海游資旣已激增，再觀上海對於資金之需要如何？東南工商繁盛之區，受戰事之摧殘，已僅存租界之一隅，昔日大企業之投資　，受損匪淺，淪陷之產業，悉遭日僞至操　，故資金之用途，已日益縮小。卽以上海租界而論，資本家亦不敢投資於大企業，以建造　規模之工廠，因在苟安局面之下，前途變化，尙難推測，是故戰後所興建之工業，均爲　規模者也。</p>
<p>上海對於資金之需要，較戰前爲减少，但資金之集中，較戰前爲甚。資金旣無止常途徑以容納，於是泛濫於市，流爲投機。其初，投機之目標，尙以外匯與標金，其於國家實力已有損害，但於人民生活尙無威脅。自歐戰後，投機之目標，更推及於外股與貨物。至於貨物之囤積，當初僅限於五金，紗花及藥品等類，其後推廣至一般人民日用必需品，如米，麵粉，煤等，數日之間，價竟倍增，對於人民生活之影響，可想而知矣。投機者雖於五月中旬，遭受嚴重之打擊，損失不貲，但未數月，投機又吿蓬勃，貨物囤積，更盛於昔，此實因游資之無良好出路。</p>
<p>總之，游資泛濫，投機囤積，不僅有害於國民經濟之發展，加重國民生活之威脅，尙足以影響戰事之前途。故我國戰時金融之病態，應從速調整，尙望政府常局之繼續努力也。爰不揣　陋，將應改革之數端，分論於下，尙祈　內識者，不吝指正。</p>
<p>欲謀我國戰時金融之合理化，莫若首先强化銀行之組織。現今我國之銀行，資本雄厚而信用卓著者，不過十餘所而已。其餘大部份之銀行，資本短小，其活動力薄弱；或因經營不善，致信用不良。如此之銀行，對於戰時金融之重負，當然不能勝任。且現今銀行之存款，大銀行增加甚速，小銀行尙時有流出之現象。小銀行之存款，均以高利吸得，當今惑於投機，以博一時之倖，豈願移資後方哉。投機者，冒險之事也，若不幸而失敗，勢　有出諸倒閉之途。銀行業之發展，原所以謀金融之安定，國民經濟之繁榮。如今小銀行林立，實爲畸形發展，反足以擾亂金融，促起國　經濟之衰落。是故銀行合併，實爲我國戰時金融　要之務。其合併之利，的有下列數項：其一，銀行台併以後，可不若現今之散漫，政府管理，自爲易也。由是銀行素抱陽奉陰違態度，可以去除。其二，銀行合併以後，規模宏大，信用堅强，乃能負戰時金融之重責。其三，銀行合併以後，資力雄厚，乃能助當局之打擊投機，及移資後方，不過竊意之銀行合併，並非將全國銀行合併於一二大銀行，以操縱全國之金融，乃將想性質相同者，相互合併，以健全銀行之組織也。</p>
<h3>提高存款利息以吸收社會</h3>
<p>— 遊資</p>
<p>我國銀行之存息，已屬過高，活存在四厘以上，定存在七厘以上，在平時銀行之負祖，已爲過重。况當今存款激增，放款减少之際，銀行對於存款之運用，已入苦悶狀態，乃爲减輕其本身負担起見，最近有减息之舉。此由銀行本身而論，似屬有和，但於國民經濟而論，則有害而無益也。蓋减息以後，對於存戶心理上之影響頗大，足以促使存戶急謀資金之運用，將在銀行之存款復流入市塲，以爲投機活動之用。是故當今之際，銀行實行减息，實屬不智，且有違乎國家金融穩定之措置。以投機之厚利與存息相較，則如此之高息，亦不免有微小之感。存戶爲投機所惑，乃紛將定存改爲活存，復將活存增加其流動率，於各銀行之業務報吿，定期存款减而活期存款　，卽爲明證。由此可知，我國銀行之存息雖高，然已無吸收社會游資之能力。當今欲謀游資之安定，惟有提高存息，使活存減弱其流通通率，更使一部份不必要之活存，可爲高息所誘，復轉位定存。當今外滙趨　，標金下落，以及商品穩定之　，一般小投機者已感無利可圖，此城提高存息，以謀游資安定之良好時機。游資趨向安定，則對於市塲投機之風，當可大戰。近　報載，財部通令提高四行簡易儲蓄，及節的建國儲金之利息，若能全國推行，實爲解決游資問題之先聲。</p>
<p>管理銀行資金</p>
<p>我國銀行向在投機之下而得畸形發展，在法幣制度之前，銀行之營業基礎爲公債，標金與地產，故於二十三四年，遇金融風潮之爆發，幾致不可收拾。法幣制度推行　，銀行業務雖有所改進，如對工商之貸放，農貸之擴大，交通事業之投資等，但銀行資金之主要運用，仍不脫投機之途。如戰事前夕之上海紗布交易所風潮及公債市價之飛騰。自戰事西移，上海恢復繁榮，於是　般銀行更注目於投機，暗滙之經營，近遠期至套利，標金之買賣，貨物之囤積，獲利之厚，爲任何投資所不及。及至今春，外股及國外證券之投機，亦達空前之活躍。但好景不長，本年五月中旬之反動，給予銀行界一决嚴事之敎訓。當今國際局勢複雜之下，投機之進行，亦不能如過去之順利，但銀行仍苦於資金無良好之出路，仍不能脫離投機。我國之有銀行，雖有數十年之歷史，其發展亦甚迅速，然於國民經濟之改進，助力甚微，實因我國政府對於銀行資金之運用，未加嚴格之監餐與指導，致銀行發展於歧途，且時有害於國民經濟之發展。此點當速謀矯正，非但有利於戰時金融之穩定，卽於戰後經濟之復與，亦有莫大之助力。本年財部八月七日頒布「非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法」十條，曾規定各銀行之存款準備金，須存儲於國家銀行，並嚴禁銀行之自營投機與囤積，及限制抵押放款等，其目的即在管理銀行資金之運用，具有遏制投機之作用。該辦法如能切實推行，對於打擊投機與囤積，實有極大之效果。上海雖爲法令不及之區，但銀行界亦應肩負穩定金融之責任，可採自動限制之方法，停止自營投機，及减少與投機囤積者之往來。助長投機囤積，本非銀行資金之良好出路。今爲國家利益與銀行本身利益計，應從速停止自營投機，與斷投機者之接濟，於目前雖爲减少　益，但於將來可避免嚴　之危機。</p>
<p>爲欲達到以戰養戰，於是日人採用各式的剝削手段，吸榨淪陷區。其手段之類別，加以歸納，大體有後端五項：</p>
<p>一，專寳　日人對於專　，不本有相當經驗，其實施於台灣朝鮮與日本　國內，均得可觀成績。專實爲一種間接課稅，寓徵稅於貨物售價之中。實施本國，對於財政收入，國民經濟上，固屬良制，而施於所侵略之地，却可在無形間盡量剝消該地人民，巨被剝創者，往往大部份尙不知爲誰所剝削。如京杭兩綫之米，歸定必由日洋行收購，再由日洋行轉售諸米商號，可是米糧經過日洋行之過渡轉折後，較原始售價，却增到一倍以上，吸榨之狠，令人寒慄。至所謂日洋行，當然決非普通商號，而是政治性機關。</p>
<p>二，統制　浙江安徽之絲繭，江蘇海門之薄荷等，凡可以換取外匯者，均加以統制，由其經營出口。吾則必故意留難，不准裝運。</p>
<p>三，苛捐　利用奸商承包稅捐，對消費所需，無物不捐，所捐之量，非重卽迭疊。</p>
<p>四，軍票　以毫無　値之軍票聯鈔等套換法幣，或直接以軍票等收購淪陷區土貨與徵用人力。</p>
<p>五，其他　覇佔生產工業，公用事業，以之控制淪陷區人民消費，從中從事剝削。</p>
<p>看了以上所述，對於日人在淪陷區吸榨，大槪可以得一輪廓了解，同時也可知道，日人已運用點綫勢力，向裏層伸展，欲支配全面淪陷區經濟。所以點綫問題，已不容我們死抱「不足介懷」之陳通，於兮應當確認嚴重性，並進步共謀對策。</p>
<p>游資之正當出路</p>
<p>銀行資金得能管理，投機之風，自可大戢；存　提高後，游資亦可漸　安定。若資金尙　良好之出路，豈非徒加　銀行之負担，銀行資金必復流入投機，以維持其自身之利益。銀行管理之效，亦必不能待久。夫上海感游資過剩，原因上海資金　覔出路，故惟有移至後方，以開發廣大之西部。俾與建設工作互相配合。現在資金內移之呼聲雖高，但內移之資金，仍爲寥寥，考其原由，不外乎下列數端：其一，銀行存款，百分之七十以上爲活存，若銀行一旦實施內移，存戶必起恐慌，又將引起　存之風潮。其二，上海爲投機之籔，誰願捨此而入後方哉？其三，後方經濟尙未　展，產業何未興建，故投資之對象甚少。其四，資金流入後方後，復受內滙之限制，若復欲流出，頗爲麻煩，故游資亦不願貿然內移矣。上述第一與第二項之困難，金融統制若能得當，　能小成問題。但其他之困難，若不去除，我國游資問題，亦必無法解決。竊　在實施游資內移之前，有四個先決問題，宜先解決。其一，政府當局當指導內移資金之出路。其二，後方富源尙待　發，將內移之資金，以作開闢草萊之工作，其事業成敗旣難預測，則安於上海投機之游資，必不願爲此艱難之工作，故政府當局須用保息方法以獎勵之。其三，對於內移之資金，不受內滙限制，使其流動得其自由。其四，對於內移資金之申請購買外滙，應放寬其限制，若止當者，由中交兩行按商滙率盡量供給。</p>
<h3>經濟榨取與封建經濟</h3>
<p>— 周美懿</p>
<p>武漢戰後，迄今一年有餘。在此段時間中，除長沙南昌戰役以外，尙未經發生大規模激烈戰爭，中日兩方多半從事經濟方面之爭取。經濟爭取之形勢，日方常佔主動，中國則處被動地位。最顯著者，如滇越禁通，滬甬停航，與過去之滇　禁運，此外又如日機之轟毀工商區域。前者之禁運停航，意在遮斷供給後方物資，後者之轟炸，意在破壞後方生產力，欲使我經濟陷於貧困崩潰，戰爭事業無力繼續。其於淪陷區域則施行「以戰養戰」盡量搜刮我民物資以供利用，或輸送出口換取外滙，卽以此外滙向海外購充軍實，或逕運日　供給不足。凡類同上述種種，皆爲日人之毒辣的經濟鬥術。</p>
<p>「封建經濟一，可採用爲「以戰養戰」之對策。所謂封建經濟，是過去政治割　下所引起來的產物，壺以往軍閥等封建主，常用之培養財　鞏固地盤。如山西兩廣之自發鈔票，統制土產出省境，截留捐我等，以及發展生產工業，力謀自給自足，使省方經濟與中央政府經濟的關係，脫離開來。如此則在他封建領域以內的經濟，可不受外力支配。此種手段，對於一個確是代表民衆的政府，自然極爲有害，一面影響其財政收入，一面加重其統一工作上的困難，阻礙政治前進。但於今以之行施於淪陷區，打擊以戰養戰毒計，對抗魑魅魍魎的醜類所加重於人民之剝削，實是無上至策。</p>
<p>現在淪陷區裏許多地方，關於經濟的爭鬥，顯然不够强度，大半僅着眼禁止輸出入，和軍蔡流通之類的客觀封鎖，而未建樹主觀的自給自足，未將經濟加以組織。因爲有了這最主要缺陷，所以在日人有規模之下，利用奸商走私進來偷運出去，輕易的被衝破了封鎖，而實際上並未能與城市經濟脫離聯繫，（城市卽點綫之點）擺脫不開爲其吸榨。此後淪陷區對城市，應加强封建化，在淪陷區中，成立許多封建經濟形態的單位。在每單位中，調查人口，估計日常必需品之消費量，提倡手工業，改良土法，發展生產，普植各類所需之農作物，不專集中某一種農作之栽植。　如通海等地之大量出產棉花薄荷）富行自足自給，再配以客觀的禁運，則自可　得封鎖城市之效果，同時也可以安定了淪陷區　人民之生活。所組織單位，其範圍務求狹小，並養成民衆能自己組織單位的習慣，因爲日人發現了此種在經濟上與之相衝突的集團後，必從而用軍律行動來破壞，單位範圍狹小，則所遭破壞者，亦僅限於某一小範圍，而與其他單位無關，不受波及。冉者日人人力有限，經佔據之農村，往往不久卽去，去後則該單位中人民，本着已往所養成之組織習慣，更因這種行爲的集團，能安定他們的生活，能解除爲日人剝削，爲着切身關係，他們自也樂於迅速恢復活動起來。</p>
<p>我們能做釗上述各種步驟，不僅已是揑住了「以戰養戰」之喉腔，同時因人民生活安定，也可以减少許多因衣食之逼而做日人之牙爪者。</p>
<h3>開於銀號銀行</h3>
<p>— 吳夢蝶</p>
<p>答瞿東升君</p>
<p>承詢七題，緙答如下：</p>
<p>（一）期貨爲現貨之對稱，還期爲近期之對稱。凡本月份內交割之交易，稱近期；下月或下數月交割之交易，稱遠期，當日可以交割之交易，爲現貨。空頭，爲先行賣出後買入之客戶，因彼係「空頭寸」也，多頭則爲先買入而後預備賣出之客戶。賣出買進而名詞原義甚明，不必解矣。</p>
<p>（二）普通銀號對於交易之證金並無一定標準。××號及聯易公會關係請參閱上期黃金市塲一文。</p>
<p>（三）開設銀號不論爲合夥組織，或股份有限公司，組織，其手續與開設一般商號杞同。在至時其營業須受銀行法之限制，但銀行法至今尙木實施。</p>
<p>（四）××洋行等係代客貿賣之經紀人，其本身係一正式之商號。猶之米號爲一正式商店，但米號之操縱米價則爲米蛀蟲。</p>
<p>（五）銀行與銀號依銀行法之規定，均屬銀仃法第一條規定：「凡營左列業務之一者爲銀行，一、收受存款及放款，二、票據貼現，三、滙兌或押滙。營前項業務之一而不　銀仃者，視同銀行。」惟目前上海之所以獨多銀號者，則因銀號在名義上爲銀行錢莊之外之金融機關，可以不受拘束耳。滙兌業務爲銀行業務，代客買賣須視情形而定。若代客買　棉紗等，則當然爲犯法，最近非常時期管理銀行法已有明文禁止。</p>
<p>（六）中央銀　爲國家銀行，其掛牌爲正式掛牌，戰前滙豐銀仃之掛牌，則係依中央銀仃掛牌而掛牌，猶之四川路小錢莊之掛牌，係抄錄滙豐掛牌爲同一情形。至戰事以後，我國管理滙兌，因之中央銀行之掛牌遂成虛價，而滙豐銀　之掛牌，則爲實際暗市買賣價。因滙豐銀行爲英國半官性質之商業銀行，故暗市外滙買賣集中於該行。</p>
<p>（七）銀行並無專備顧客採購公債票之儲藏。公僓目前暗市並無期貨。至期貨與　貨之價格貴賤。須視本月份與下月份金融情形，與商品流通情形而定。</p>
<h3>電費計算法</h3>
<p>— 黃雲千</p>
<p>邇來自電力費　增加比率後，一般用戶因未明瞭計算方法，致對於普通製成品上之成本，關於電費部分，均予的略，計算殊不準確。爰特將鄙見計算方法，釋明於後。</p>
<p>例如電燈用電六三度，計銀七兩五錢六分，附加費百分之一八〇、九七，等於每度電費需銀三分三厘七一六四〇，以規兀七一五計算，則每度電燈電之費用，合國幣四角七分一厘五五六。</p>
<p>普通電力用戶之電，本較燈費低廉得多，每度電費　需銀四分五厘，合國幣　分二厘九。現以附加費比率百分之三五五。八七計算，較前已爲增高不少。但每度所需電費仍祗一錢另五一四一，合國幣　角八分六厘九。例如普通電力用電一四八八度，計銀六六兩九錢六分，附加費　分至三五五　八七等於每度所需銀　錢另五一四一。再以規　七一五計算，　每度普通電力之費用，應爲二角八分六厘丸。</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖剴瓊</p>
<p>—十一月九日—　川康的經濟建設</p>
<p>中日戰爭進入第二個階段之後，已由軍事戰爭轉爲經濟戰爭了。目前中國的川康兩省是抗戰建國的重要根據地，爲加强經濟作戰的力量，對於這兩省農，林，工，礦，交通，金融的諸設施與整理，必須積極地作有效的推進，所以在蔣委員長領導下的川康經濟建設委員會已於十一月二日在成都止式成立。該會集合政府與人民的力量，集中川康兩省的黨，政，軍，民的領袖，以及省內外的名流學者，即於成立之日，召開第一决大會，歷時三日，會議三决，議決耍案七十餘件。並遵照蔣委長所擬的川康經濟建設計劃大綱草案，四川省生產計劃委員會的四川省經濟建設三年計劃草案，西康省府所擬的西康省經濟建設綱要，擬定整個具體的川康經濟建設計劃，同時決定擴大資金，迅速組成川康興業公司，以爲實際推動經濟建設業務的機構四川省蘊藏豐富，夙有一天府」的稱謂，可見它經濟的潛能力底偉大。抗戰之後，成爲中國的後方重心，爲適應國防的需要，奠定民生的基礎，經濟建設自然要與政治軍事相配合起來而也以四川省作爲中心。至於與四川毘連的西康，雖說是新建的省份，可是寳藏之多，除在交通方面稍感不便外，一切的一切，都適合經濟建設的條件，允應在這新建的省份上寄與最大的期望，切莫貨棄於地，不能利用。</p>
<p>按抗戰以來，中央在川辦理對於國防有關的鋼鐵燃料公用事業的電氣，及供給工業動力的電力，這兩者的投資總額在三千萬元以上。又協助民營的事業，如鋼鐵業，化學工業，造紙業，火柴業，燃料業，機械業，電力業，紡織業等，投資總額則在三萬萬元以上。在農業方面的貸款，據正確的總計在四千萬元以上，的佔全國農業貸款總額的三分之一。至於西康建省之後，在過去的一年中，工業的興建，也有長足的進展，在康定和雅安有毛織廠的創立，利用康定與　昌兩屬所產的，牛羊皮，在雅安特設規換較大的皮革廠，以新式方法製造皮革；利用雅安所產的白夾竹，設立造紙廠；利用豐富的森林，在大相嶺東麓某地設立木材乾溜廠；同時適應雅安工業方面的需要設立水力發電廠，以供給工業動力。這些不過是川康經濟建設的一部份，此外可供開發和亟待　辦的事業，仍需多方面的繼續努力建設。　（未完）</p>

<h3>中央銀行舊址　業已售予外商　佔用計劃必將遭遇困難　該屋具有歷史上重要性</h3>
<p>字林報云、九江路外灘轉角之中央銀行大厦、昨（九日）在公共租界警官與日憲兵隊官佐之前、竟遭接收、此舉之最後宗旨何在、尙無正式消息可得、</p>
<p>日方通知決予接管</p>
<p>惟據可靠　人方面消息、此厦將開設「中央銀行」、接收之前、日憲兵隊曾通知工部局工務處、謂有接管此房產之意、九時甫過、中央捕房卽派警官前往該厦啟鍵入內、查察一過至近中午始離、該厦空置有時、厦內並無負責之人、僅　閣若干而已、午後、該厦遂遭接收、</p>
<p>觀察情形　似將修理</p>
<p>所謂要員、尚未入內、惟厦左院內頓形活動、隔下鍵之院門內矚、見持械「政治警察」多人、或衣黑制服、或穿便裝、往來院中、其數不詳、厦前前駐有公共租界巡捕若干、奉令不准閒人入內、就昨日厦內活動情形斷之、似先將進行裝修、然後始有人員入內、昨晨、厦內有苦力多人、從事打掃、</p>
<p>傳房屋爲　外商所有</p>
<p>查中政府中央銀行退出該廈已久、旋有　部局學校一所假此開課、惟該校近已遷往大西路、故厦內無人佔用、傳重慶方面已將該房屋售予外商、此說如果屬實、則利用該厦之計劃、諒將遭遇阻難、按中央銀行大厦係業已倒閉之華俄道勝銀行原址、具有歷史上重要性、</p>
<p>蔣委員長　一度蒞臨</p>
<p>中政府得此房產後、作爲官方中央銀行之辦事處、政府大員曾蒞臨該厦、如財長孔祥熙與刻在美國之宋子文、前後兼仟中央銀行總裁、皆曾設辦公處於其中、蔣委員長亦曾蒞臨該厦、親送孔祥熙赴英參加英王加冕典禮、故華方人士對該厦之移交、頗加重視、</p>

<h3>「神秘的病」</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>不知道　什麼時候起，也許是打聽到了美國撤退遠東僑民的消息時起，我們的主人翁突然發覺身上什麼地方給人挖了去。或者就是心臟也說不定。因爲他恍惚感到那兒異樣空虛，大槪給挖得什麼也不剩了巴。</p>
<p>打那時起，我們的主人翁開始暗暗地尋求怎樣充實那個空洞的方法。他沒有去請敎醫生，他認爲醫牛們什九是靠不住的。他們的所謂割股之心」只專門運用在怎樣敲病人的竹槓上，那裏還能醫病？不如自我療養！他忖過到香港，不，馬尼刺去，去一兩個月也好。他先想他可以把一所有都帶去，但是一轉念：不行！那些不動產怎麼辦？馬尼刺不能去。他什麼地方也不能去！</p>
<p>就在這兒打打麻將，看看戲，不也是一種精神治療嗎？他「不得已而求其决」。搭子有的是：我們的主人翁儘多朋友，塲面上的朋友。此外還有「下屬」！老板要散心，「下屬們沒有不奉陪的。看戲有「門下食客」中的「內行一作伴。但是鬧別扭，運氣眞壞！麻將打幾　，輸幾塲。「老麻將」會鬧了幾决笑話：抓到　花　，忘了抓「槓頭」！鑼鼓，嗩吶的交響，對於他猶如隔世的東西。他只覺得那個空洞似乎在擴大，擴大。不多久，他就厭惡了一百三十多張和那個「內行」。</p>
<p>這發展，因爲是潛伏的，並沒有人發見，卽使親信如我們主人翁的太太，而他也不願給人發覺。在接待朋友時，依然是高聲轟笑。也許笑聲顯得較前更放肆，但這是不足以引起朋友們的注意的。那些朋友們一想起地價的增高，就以爲猜到了他好笑的理由，附和羞作會心笑了。在接見下屬時也依然「恩威並施」。或者說話聲稍稍大一些。對於家屬，則依然是嚴肅，慈祥，永遠和他們保持着相當的距離。</p>
<p>但是那個空洞似乎在漸漸擴大，直到一天在一個宴會上。那天他的興致特別高：喝了半杯「威十忌」，胃口忽然變得非常好。也不管什麼Etiquettette，十多道菜統統給吃得現了盆底。他一邊用Napkin抹抹嘴，一邊滿意地撫摸心臟那兒：「好極了！好極了！」突然發覺坐在旁邊的人在對自己微笑，他就平和地說：「我是說今天的菜好極了。是不是？」</p>
<p>那天深夜回到家裏，就沉沉地睡去了。也許是因爲乏了，或者是那本洞已給充實了。總之，我們的主人翁獲得了一個好久不曾有的甜睡。</p>
<p>第二天，當晨光熹微時，他醒來了。第一個動作是用手去按心臟那兒。那隻手軟癱地滑下來。那個「神秘的病　又随着晨光回來了！</p>
<p>一骨落爬起身，按　下電鈴，吩咐下人把早餐端來。不刷牙，就狼呑虎嚥起來。他埋怨下人把早餐弄得太精緻：麵包太少，牛奶也只一點點。下人吃驚地替他添了二决。</p>
<p>吃得喘氣了，撫摸一下心臟那　。但是「上帝保佑」！「站在這裏做什麽？」他對那目定口呆的下人咆哮着。</p>
<p>這樣，我們的主人翁繼續不斷地在尋求怎樣充實那個空虛的方法。你瞧：他獨個兒蹙着眉，一手按着心臟那兒，在想，想那個方法……</p>
<h3>�到看到聽到</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>有一天，跑進北京路工部局圖書館公共閱覽室內，在放報的架上，看到了一張央文的佈吿，大概的意思爲「每人閱覽某種報紙，在十分鐘外，如遇他人需看時則必須交給。』，那正可以給一般自私的公共圖書館閱讀者感到一點警惕吧？</p>
<h3>脱離苦海同登彼岸　願資助有志屛絕嗜好者</h3>
<p>— 楊少卿</p>
<p>鄙人於昔年因病吸烟成癮，事變後，十價奇昂，且生活費用不斷增長，精神經濟，交受其困。於是痛下決心，以期戒絕。惟初以戒法不良，致痛苦備遭，而且的未達。今春由友人介紹，就戒於中國戒烟療養院，經金學高院長詳察體氣，補戒兼施，治病袪癮，同時並舉；爲期祗及月餘，於毫無痛楚之中，烟癮斷絕，宿疾亦除。出院後，飲食體重，俱見增加，迄今身體健康，精神飽滿，前後判若兩人。鄙人自脫離苦海後，以耗費頓减，身心俱泰，而對於業務上之經營，亦得專心致力，不憚煩劇，其裨益於經濟方面者，允非淺鮮。私衷慶幸之餘，因念社會上靑年有爲之士，與鄙人抱有同病者，頗不乏人，誤染惡癖貽害無窮，其有志切戒除者，或以限於經濟，或以未得善法，致因循坐誤，不能自拔；非但一已之前途，爲之斷送，即社會國家，亦因以蒙其損失，言念及此，良用慨然，爰本立己人之旨，作拯飢拯溺之圖，自願將戒烟後所省耗費之資，提助有志者戒除嗜好之用，並蒙金院長熱心贊助，允予在技術上全盡義務，所有藥資膳食等費，概由鄙人負担支付。惟鄙人家非富有，每月祗能資助二名爲限，凡爲靑年而染有烟癮，決心戒除而無經濟能力者，均可覔具妥保，投函法租界興聖街九號同泰興號登記，經審查合格後，即可入院施戒（該院在馬浪路四五四號）。上述辦法，暫定以一年爲限，自知區區之數，收效甚微，未能使沉淪黑籍同胞，咸登彼岸，顧一人之能力有限，聊盡綿薄，不過藉作社會之先驅，尙望各界有心人繼起響應，推廣而普及之，使毒氛消除，直接　苦海同胞造福，問接爲國家民族堵養其元氣，則鄙人所馨香祝禱者也。</p>

<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>施桂報吿說：　霍先生，有個老頭兒要進來見你，模　兒很奇怪。我問他要名片，他父拿不出，又不肯說姓名。</p>
<p>霍桑停了脚步，點點頭說：「好，請他進來。」他隨手把壁爐簷上的兩盞電燈也一起開了。</p>
<p>不一回，一個白髮白鬚，滿面皺紋，穿着一件寬大的黑綢袍子的老人，低着頭彎着腰蹣跚地走進來。這老人的肩膊有相當的闊度，要是他的背不彎，高度仇許超出霍桑以上。他一走進來，好像很熟悉的樣子，向霍桑連連拱着手，嘴裏發出粗嗄的聲音。「霍先生。一又回過來向我拱拱手。「包先生。」</p>
<p>我覺得這老人的禮貌旣很周到，論情，我不能小昭禮　答。我急忙站起來鞠了一個躬，正要請敎他的姓名，霍桑忽　彎了彎腰，搶在我前面發話。</p>
<p>「趙先生，請坐。」</p>
<p>那老人的身子微微一震。這同樣的本能動作，立卽影響到我的身上。趙先生？趙伯雄嗎？我的手不期然而然地伸到衣袋裹去。</p>
<p>霍桑的眼角裏顯然　瞧見我的動作，忙婉聲說道：「包朗，慢着。這位是趙伯雄先生。——不過這祇是他暫時假定的姓名。趙先生，是不是？」</p>
<p>那老人忽而格格地笑起來了。他不再驚異，也沒有侷促不安的神氣。「霍先生，我小能不佩服你的眼力。你眞有能耐！」他一壁說，一壁就在書桌面前的一隻沙發上坐下。</p>
<p>霍桑也坐了下來，冷澀地答道：「那末，你這樣子打扮，目的冉要讓我的眼睛有一個測騐的機會嗎？」</p>
<p>那假老頭兒趙伯雄忙接嘴說：「不是，霍先生，你誤會了。我老實說，我不換這個裝束，不敢從豐泰裏出來，怕會遭遇不必要的麻煩。你派遺的那個尾隨我的瘦子，的確很幹練。剛才直等我到了豐泰店裏，才發覺有人在店門外監視着。我很佩服他。他一路跟隨着我，我竟完全不知不覺。」（一六　）</p>

<h3>化粧品是不是浪費</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>有些人說，購買化粧品是一種浪費，然而事實上並不是絕對準確的。</p>
<p>固然，我們如果仿照許多歐美的婦女，在粧台上放上成羣的化粧品，而在晚上把面部頸部包紮得好像是一個受了意外損傷者，正是不必需的。不過借着化粧品的帮助，去表揚固有的優點，掩藏可厭的缺點，似乎可以讓婦女們保留這一點權利。</p>
<p>在戀愛中的女子，因爲化粧品的帮助而和她們的情人結爲終身伴侶以後，生養了有爲的子女，能彀爲國家做一點工作，那末這種美容工作，倒是很有意義的。</p>
<p>一個聰明的妻子，利用化粧品把她的美貌，長時間的保持着，使她的丈夫不會到外面去開蕩，那末這一點爲着化粧品而付出的代價，　成爲有用的投資了。</p>
<p>而且，根　眞正的美容原理說起來，美容工作的整個部份還包括着健康和淸潔的二個必要條件，要得到美容的眞正效果，第一步工作是使我們的皮膚毛孔中，一點　不存什麼汚穢，使我們皮膚的細胞，個個具有生氣。這種基本工作，對於我們全身的健康，大有關係，那末因爲使用化粧品，實行美容而間接促進了身體的健康，所獲的利益，就比所費的金錢更多。</p>
<p>所以，如果我們認淸目標，並不是盲目的購買，化粧品並不是一種浪費。而本刋的出版，也　不是浪費筆墨了。</p>
<h3>心理上的美容工作</h3>
<p>— 芳菲</p>
<p>不要使人牛的痛苦在你的面部描繪出來</p>
<p>處於這個人事繁複的時代，如果祗從表　去　行美容工作，還是不够的，因爲還有心理的一方面，是不能忽略的。</p>
<p>無論你是怎樣的年輕和夫麗，每天的生活，往往會在你的面上，留下深刻的現象。我們大都有一種特別的　部表情，並且讓我們的情感—煩惱，恐懼，或者快樂，在面上　現出來。祇要看一看那些中年的婦女，在她們的面上，往往有很多的皺紋，所以決不要以爲自己正在靑春的最好的一個時期，預防是很重要的一個工作。</p>
<p>面部的靑春之美，在眼睛裹表現出來，因此你們對於眼睛的美貌，決不可以忽略，不要在看東西的時候，把眼睛收小，因爲這種動作，容易　成衰老的外表。</p>
<p>不要時常皺眉　因爲習慣以後，不但有損　貌，並且還有害你的性格，斜視也應該免除，如果在目光之下，那末小妨戴上眼鏡，決不要把眼睛斜視。如果多看書或者做精巧的手工，你就應該有充足的燈光</p>
<p>如果你時常愁眉不展，你就應該養成笑的習慣，因爲笑可以去除額上的皺紋。有許多人在笑的時候，往往要把鼻下皺起來，這在年輕的時候是無關　要，甚至於是美麗的，但到了相當時候，就要在鼻部，顯出可厭的紋路。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來談談嘴部：在講話或者聽別人說話的時候，你要故做弄你的嘴脣嗎？或者是用嘴部做出種種姿勢？或者咬着嘴脣？意這些情形，實在不能讓牠們繼續下去，因爲牠們會變更你嘴上的紋理的。</p>
<p>最好每隔相當時候，把自已研究一下，必就够有許多發現，請她：你是不是感　疲倦？你是不是不願去參加什麼宴會？你就應該想法增加你的精力，或者是因爲缺少了某種　他命，在這一種情形之　，你最好去看一决醫生，因爲有許多人往往因爲身體衰弱，因　喪失她們的美貌的。</p>
<p>有時候當你在研究的時候，會發現　部的　麗減退是　因於脚部的，根據科學的紀錄，穿了一雙過緊的鞋子，往往就會在面部現出痛苦的樣子，而且這種苦痛，對於神經部份也大有損害。</p>
<p>說起神經，你也許會因爲失意，受了刺激，而使你的神經不安，於是性悄暴躁，在晚上失眠，這種現象，立刻就可以在你的面部表現出來。當然我們不能够遏制情感，不使牠在面部表現出來，然而設法减少這種痛苦，還是事實上可能的。</p>
<p>煩惱可以使眼睛的周圍產生皺紋，憂愁往往會從嘴部和眼睛顯出牠的存在，而最有損於　貌的就是恐懼，要免除這種煩惱，憂愁，恐懼的情感，你可以分析事實，實在有許多事情是小値得去煩惱，憂愁，或恐懼的。</p>
<p>所以要得到眞正的　貌，除了採用適當的化妝品之外，還要使身體健康，遏制有損美貌的情感。</p>
<h3>談肌膚營養</h3>
<p>— 凌乃萍</p>
<p>如果你皮下細胞的新陳代謝機能失常，那末你皮膚外表必呈鬆弛，皺紋，枯燥，粗糙，黯黑等的狀態，甚至因膚色的衰退，雖然你還在年靑，而竟會消失了你靑春的丰姿，但是在這二十世紀科學萬能的現時代，不用担憂，因爲已有了營養健美肌膚的治療品問世了，如常貝康化妝品無限公司最新出品的「百雀羚」，就是專鬥營養皮裏細胞供給皮下脂肪及潔凈毛孔內之塵垢並能縮小毛孔的　膚劑，據經騐所知搽用「百雀羚最好在臨睡前遍搽面部及手部，因其潔凈毛孔的工作，更能發揮效力，日間搽用，可當作粉底用，同時善能衛護氣候的侵襲，而不使皮膚受到日灼風吹的刺激，這樣非但能營養保護你的肌膚，而且能促　你美麗的基點—膚和凝脂，使你靑春永駐，卽雖年事增高，而丰姿亦必不</p>
<h3>漫談燙髮</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>如　有人對你說：「你的頭髮燙得和天然的一般」，這實在不是一種恭維。因爲眞正優美的燙髮，是應該天然的。要使燙髮的成績好，有幾個先決條件：第一，頭髮必須在完美的狀態之下，在燙髮之前，應該有好些日子的梳理，刷淸，塗上油質；第二，在燙髮之前洗髮時所用洗髮水也是十分重要的。這種洗髮水的性質不能太强烈，因爲太强烈以後，就要把頭皮裏的油質洗去，這種油質是很寳貴的。</p>
<p>有許多人以爲頭髮在燙過以後，會恢復原狀的，其實並不如此，燙得好的可以使頭髮長時期的　曲。當然頭髮是在生長的，所以鬈曲的部份，就隨着垂下，不久就被剪去了。燙髮的機器有好幾種式樣，最新式的可以不與頭髮接觸，就是所謂「無綫電燙」了。利用化學品，放在頭髮上，經過相當時間，頭髮就成爲波浪形了。</p>
<p>在目前燙髮所需要的時間，已經是大爲减縮了。在三十年前最初發明的第一架燙髮器的納斯爾（Charles　Nestle）在倫敦第一决應用，每代一個女子燙髮需要八小時到十小時的時間，所以他自一九〇五年到一九〇九年只燙了七十二决，現在的速率就不同了，在英美各國每年要燙髮三千七百五十萬决。在當初有許多皇室中人，曾經在納斯爾的手下，任受過八小時到十小時的苦刑，每燙一决的價目是美金二百五十元。和現在比較起來，那是有天差地遠了。</p>
<p>在燙髮以後，應該每天使用髮刷，可以使鬈曲的形態，更爲美麗，並且能彀使頭髮更爲柔順，防止頭髮脫落。但切不要用熱水梳理頭髮，正當的方法是用頭油。其决，在燙髮的時候，不妨做一點試騐工作，試試你的頭髮，燙那一種式樣最好。</p>

<h3>七種面部的形態　你是屬於那一類的？</h3>
<p>根據好萊塢美容專家惠斯摩亞說，面部的天生形態，共有七種：就是橢圓，菱形，三角形，倒三角形，圓形，方形，和長方形。最合乎理想的是橢圓形，那就是我們所謂「鵝蛋臉」了。</p>
<p>在電影明星之中，可以尋出每一種形態的代表者。讀者如果參看這些人的形態，就可以知道自已是屬於那一類的：</p>
<p>橢圓形　紺兒潘琪（Gale　Page）。菱形琴惠曼（Jane　Wyman）。</p>
<p>三角形　琴勃蘭JaneBryan）。</p>
<p>倒三角形　安妮泰露意絲（Anita　Louise）。</p>
<p>圓形　潘麗西拉蘭（Priscilla　Lane）。　方形安秀麗丹（Snn　Sheridan）。</p>

<h3>德國婦女的戰時美容品</h3>
<p>戰時的德國，不能再容婦女們使用肥皂，霜膏，牛奶去美容，然而對於婦女美貌的保持，却並沒有忽略，德國勞工前綫的美容專家羅美女士，於是把下列的東西，供獻給德國的婦女。</p>
<p>一，旣然小能使用肥皂，長春藤的樹葉，是很好的代替品，因爲可以在露天淴浴。</p>
<p>二，用牛奶洗面，已經不是時候了，這可以用雨水加野</p>
<p>栗千的汁來代替，方法是用野栗子剝去了皮，曬乾以後，磨碎煮熟，加水以後，就可以成爲很好的洗面水。</p>
<p>三，至於身體所需要的維他命，那末可以吃卷心菜，胡蘿蔔，芹菜，和蘋菓。</p>
<h3>香水種種</h3>
<p>— 維敏</p>
<p>在化粧品之中，香水佔着很重要的位置，製造香水，實在是一種藝術而不是一種科學；兩個印刷家，把同一的照片印刷起來，結果決不會一樣，兩個香水製造家，採取同一的原料，也決不會產生同樣的香水。</p>
<p>因爲香水的製造並不容易，因此香水的代價，也就非常昂貴，以素馨花Jasmine）而論，必須在早晨摘取花朶，使花上仍舊留着早露，然後把花瓣放在盤裹，盤底鋪着蠟質，到了明天，將花瓣棄去，另外加入新採的花瓣，每天照樣的做去，竟要經過一季的時間，然後從蠟裏面，把花油提煉出來，要做成二磅的花油，需要二萬五千磅的鮮花，所以這二磅花油的價値，就要美金七八百元了，所以這種油，往往是放在金屬的盒子裏面，並且像珠寳一樣的被保存起來的</p>
<p>有許多人把香水直接放到皮膚上去，這實在是並不妥當的，因爲有些人的皮膚是含有酸性的，香水一着皮膚，因爲化學的作用，香味立刻就消滅了，所以最好是把香水放在衣服上面，衣襟，袖口，都是很適宜的地方。切不要把香水塗在頭髮上，因爲有些人的頭髮中的油質並不能和香水中的油質混合起來，這與香水不能塗在皮毛上是同一的原理。</p>
<p>在購買香水之後，對於牠的保藏，是相當重要的，每一個瓶千應該用瓶塞塞緊，要避免亮光和熱度，吾則在很短的時期以後，你的香水就無形中消滅了。如果你發現香水中有混濁的現狀，那末你可以斷定，已經有人偷竊過巾把水和入了。</p>
<h3>美容珍屑</h3>
<p>— 羅</p>
<p>這裏是許多方法　或者可供參考</p>
<p>要使齒牙潔白，在日用牙　之外，可以冉用檸檬汁和食鹽，每星期刷牙一决。在用脣膏的時候，如果用深紅的脣膏，可以使齒牙見得很潔白。</p>
<p>當你的手上的皮膚現着紫色或棕色的時候，可以用番薯揩，立刻可以使皮膚白嫩。</p>
<p>短訊　聞名市上之林肯藥水牙膏，行銷中國已近三載。因其價廉物美，到處風行，口碑載道。最近該行提創「睡前刷牙運動」，用信的方式，廣爲鼓吹，此於口腔衛生一道，大有裨益。</p>
<p>昨偶値該行華經理朱君，據吿該行籌備已久之林肯小脫胭脂，在此旬日內亦可問世。另有香皂，香粉，髮臘，冬夏兩季川冷霜等，均將先後與市人相見。</p>
<p>市上流行的雪花，往往粗製濫造，質料和香韻，很難鑑別祇有江生化學工藝廠出品的姊妹霜，功效特大，在洗面後臨睡前，一經搽擦，皮膚立卽滋潤而細膩，如果冉把該廠出品的四福牌摩登香粉撲上去，就有吸收粘貼，容光煥發起來，經售處各埠百貨商店及藥房。</p>
<p>當你要化妝的時候，你曾想起有誰敎你怎樣化妝嗎？現在我就介紹一本「美的書」給你讀那裏有一篇「美容備忘錄」，將使你學會完全而實用的化妝法，並且這書裏還有膏霜脂粉脣膏眉筆等十種精緻的化妝品給你實騐，（因爲這本書還是一個新穎的妝奩）那末你必能化妝得非常嬌媚了！</p>
<h3>好萊塢的美容專家吿訴你　如何測量你的面貌</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>你的面貌，是吾合乎標準，也許是你很急於知道的一個問題，現在已經由好萊塢美容專家惠斯摩亞給你制定了一種方法，不妨試試。</p>
<p>拍一張照相</p>
<p>第一步，你得拍一張照相，在照的時候，應該向着照相機正面看，（或者在你所有的照相之中，選擇一張適當的，但不要選擇面部斜轉或是向上的，因爲不是正面的照相，是很難於做測量的工作的。）</p>
<p>第二步是照左面的第一圖劃二條直綫，和三條橫綫，你就可以看出你的面部的整個部位。</p>
<p>你的前額是吾太高</p>
<p>當你把你的照片劃了錢以伐，你就可以看出，你的前額，是吾太高？如果是太高的話，那末，你可以把頭髮梳得低一些，用頭髮覆一部份在前額。</p>
<p>如果你的眼睛與頭髮中間的距離，不及眼睛和嘴脣之間的距離，那末你就應該把頭髮梳得高一些了。</p>
<p>你的嘴太狹或者太闊嗎？</p>
<p>要判斷你的嘴，終究是吾太狹或者太闊，你可以對着鏡子笑，笑時的嘴角，應駭和眼珠的中心相齊（見第二圖）。如果嘴部太狹或太闊，你就可以用脣膏，來補救天然的缺點。</p>
<p>嘴脣太闊的人，可以杷脣膏在嘴的中間，搽得較厚，然後向外淡去。如果嘴部太狹，那末可以把脣膏搽得狹一些。</p>
<p>不要使綫條　垂</p>
<p>在第三圖中，可以看出面部的錢條：眉毛，眼睛或嘴脣，在美容的時候，切不耍使這種綫條下垂，因爲下垂以後，就顯出種愁慮的樣子，對於整個面貌的美觀，要產生無限的損害了</p>

<h3>Thailand's Claim for Territory, France Denies, Vietnamese Reserve Soldiers, France Has Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>Vichy: The French Colonial Ministry has not yet received confirmation regarding Vietnam's call-up of reserve soldiers between the ages of 40 and 50. The French Foreign Minister yesterday denied rumors that Thailand had delivered an ultimatum to the Vietnamese authorities demanding the cession of Vietnamese territory, nor has he received any protests from Thailand regarding French border violations. There is no change in the situation between Vietnam and Thailand. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Simultaneously Announced by Moscow and Berlin, Soviet Foreign Minister Invited to Visit Germany, Exchange of Views on Current Relations Between the Two Countries, Generally Considered a Turning Point in International Situation</h3>
<p>Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, has decided to visit Berlin in the near future at the invitation of the German government and in response to the German Foreign Minister's visit to the Soviet Union last year. The purpose of this trip is to continue and further exchange views through personal contact within the framework of the current friendly relations between the two countries. (TASS News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Local authorities announced yesterday that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will visit Berlin. The official announcement reads: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, at the invitation of the German government and in return for the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Moscow last year, will visit Berlin in the near future to consolidate the current diplomatic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union and directly exchange views. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Diplomatic circles here believe that Molotov's decision to visit Berlin is sufficient to indicate that Soviet-German relations are harmonious. It is recalled here that the two countries have repeatedly declared that their relationship is based on common interests and is not of a temporary nature. The specific date of Molotov's departure for Berlin has not yet been scheduled. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to well-informed sources, Molotov was scheduled to depart from Moscow last night and will arrive in Berlin on Tuesday. (United Press International, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today, official sources here announced that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will soon visit Berlin. Nazi circles regard Molotov's visit as a major event, believing that this move may be a turning point in the European war and may unite the Soviet Union with Germany, Italy, and Japan to complete the plan for a "New World Order." Unofficial observers predict that Molotov's trip to the German capital will be the prelude to a major agreement and may have an impact on the Balkans and the Near East. There will also be formal coordination between the Soviet Union and Japan. (International News Service, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: After the news of Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, planning to visit Berlin in return, people here are paying close attention, because it is unprecedented for someone of Molotov's high rank to visit another country in return. Newspaper commentary believes that Molotov's trip confirms cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>New York: Diplomatic circles here are quite excited about Molotov's upcoming visit to Germany. Generally, it is believed that Molotov's visit marks the end of Britain's dreams of the Soviet Union, and German-Soviet relations will become closer. They predict that the Soviet Union can obtain abundant raw materials from Germany. British newspapers have published this news in large letters and commented on it, believing that Molotov's visit immediately after the American election proves that Roosevelt's victory has not hindered the relationship between totalitarian countries. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin, British officials today declined to comment, only stating that such a visit was not entirely unexpected. (International News Service, 10th)</p>
<h3>China Loses a Good Friend, Piddock Dies of Illness Yesterday, Former British Prime Minister Chamberlain Also Passes Away</h3>
<p>Reno, Nevada: Senator Piddock, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of China's most loyal friends, passed away at 11:30 this morning at Washoe County General Hospital due to heart disease. This famous Democratic senator's advocacy for China and the embargo against Japan is well known throughout the country. This 68-year-old senator was admitted to the hospital the night before last, after his Republican opponent, Pollard, failed in the congressional election and he was re-elected. This Nevada Democrat was placed in an oxygen room after feeling heart discomfort yesterday, but ultimately succumbed to the illness. Piddock became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1933. Before serving as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he had many accomplishments regarding the silver issue. Because of his involvement in the silver plan, he was naturally a person of great interest in the eyes of the Chinese government, as China had long relied on the United States to purchase Chinese silver. At that time, he was elected as a senator. At that time, there was Senator Nixon, whose term was to expire on March 7, 1917, but Nixon resigned before the end of his term, and his vacancy was filled by Piddock. Since then, Piddock has been repeatedly elected. Piddock's father was William Bradford Piddock, and his mother was Catherine Piddock. He was taught by private tutors in his childhood, and later attended Southwestern Presbyterian University, Washington University, and Nevada University, eventually earning a doctorate in literature. In 1892, he began practicing law in Seattle, but his adventurous spirit was very strong. In 1897, he joined a group going to Klondike, Alaska to mine gold. In 1928, he served as Chairman of the Democratic Party's platform proposal committee at the Democratic National Convention and was nominated by the convention as the Democratic Party's candidate for president. On March 9, 1933, he became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On June 12 of the same year, he was appointed by the US President as the American representative to the London Monetary and Economic Conference. He fought for the silver plan for 30 years and achieved success in both the London Conference and the Senate plenary session. This career of his made him familiar to silver-using countries in the East, feeling that he was more familiar than any other American senator. His reputation in the Far East was expanded by his support for Philippine independence. Chamberlain, former Prime Minister of Britain, has passed away last night, at the age of 71. According to his doctor, Chamberlain was quite calm when in danger. (United Press International, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Former Prime Minister Chamberlain passed away last night at his country villa at the age of 71. He was born on March 18, 1869. His father and brother were both politicians. After studying at Rugby and Mason College, he transferred to the business world, going to the Bahamas for seven years before returning to England. He then served in the Birmingham City Council, serving as Chairman of the City Planning Committee. In 1915, he became Mayor of Birmingham. In the 1918 general election, he was elected as a member of Parliament. For the first four years, he was quite unknown. On the 18th, he succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister, at a time when the international situation was already quite tense. He insisted on prudence in diplomatic events. In order to prevent the expansion of the Spanish Civil War, he tried his best to improve relations with Germany and Italy. Foreign Minister Eden expressed his dissatisfaction with this and resigned immediately. He appointed Halifax as Foreign Minister. The Anglo-Italian Agreement was signed in Rome on April 16, 1938. In September 1938, he flew to Germany three times due to the Sudetenland incident to prevent Hitler from using troops against Czechoslovakia. Finally, on the 30th of that month, the Munich Agreement was signed by Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries, with Britain and France guaranteeing the border of Czechoslovakia from aggression. He and Hitler also signed a declaration that Germany and Britain would never go to war.</p>
<p>Washington: According to news obtained from diplomatic circles here, the United States may obtain naval and air bases on the east and west coasts of Mexico to resolve some of the general political and economic relations between the two countries. If the United States can enjoy special base privileges in Veracruz and Acapulco to make the defense of the Panama Canal stronger, military strategists in the country will certainly welcome it. US Undersecretary of State Welles and Mexican Ambassador to the United States Najera have discussed important disputes between the two countries several times to seek complete solutions to benefit Pan-American unity and Western Hemisphere defense. Welles also discussed with Roosevelt for a long time. Welles said that he did not hear about the proposal of Mexico's bases. However, diplomatic circles know that Washington officials and Mexico City are considering a general solution, which includes the following: (1) The United States leases several base locations on one or two coasts from Mexico, on the condition that Mexico's sovereignty in the leased area is not damaged. (2) The rent paid by the United States must provide Mexico with sufficient US dollar foreign exchange, with a surplus after repaying the long-sought purchase price of farmland from the United States. (3) After Camacho took office as President of Mexico, he published a statement announcing the reopening of negotiations between Mexico and Shell Oil Company and Mobil Oil Company to resolve the demands arising from the requisition of their properties in Mexico. (4) The income obtained from leasing the bases to the United States is used by Mexico to pay to the two oil companies. If the difference is determined to be made up for with oil, then it is made up for with oil. (International News, 10th)</p>
<p>Piddock was the chairman of the Senate Silver Committee. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, his actions had made the Chinese people recognize him as the most sympathetic to China's resistance. He advocated adopting a strong embargo plan to resist Japan and also supported Congress authorizing the president to declare a ban on the shipment of all raw materials to Japan. He firmly supported the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, under which China benefited greatly from the US government's purchase of silver. He openly endorsed Britain's war with Germany and Italy, and he was also in an important active position regarding the implementation of the US National Defense Program and the expansion of US aid to Britain. As the chairman of the Internal Affairs Committee, his words and actions were sufficient to influence the entire committee, enabling the committee to tend to adopt plans that were beneficial to China and Britain. He was born on September 19, 1872, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. In 1912, he went to mining with commoners. Piddock served as a common miner for two years and then became a member of a certain political system committee in Alaska. In 1900, he married Ms. Mims. In January 1902, he returned to Tonopah, Nevada. At that time, in addition to engaging in activities to become a senator, he did not hope to hold any public office. In 1912, he was elected as a senator, filling the seat of Senator Nixon, who did not complete his term. Subsequently, on November 6, 1916, 1922, and 1934, he was re-elected. From 1913 to 1917, he served as the secretary of the Senate Democratic Party primary election committee. At the Democratic National Conventions of the 66th, 67th, 68th, 69th, 70th, and 72nd sessions, he was the temporary secretary of the conference for electing candidates for president. In 1924, as the secretary of the platform and proposal committee of the Democratic National Convention, he was the main person responsible for the establishment of the party. When he attended the London Economic Conference in June 1933, most of the negotiations were about international agreements to promote the restoration of normalcy in the silver industry. Mexico, the world's leading silver-producing country, has permanently engraved this fact in its heart and has set up a silver festival to commemorate this Nevada senator. In the 72nd plenary session of the Congress, the matters he managed included the American-Cuban treaty, the Pan-American treaty, the American-Mexican treaty, and the non-aggression treaty concluded by the United States with Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas. The above treaties have been approved. People in the Senate recognize him as a clever tactician, because every time he achieves his wishes, it is based on clever techniques, not on the pressure of speeches. (United Press International, 10th)</p>
<p>Chamberlain</p>
<p>London: Advocated for the appeasement policy, which was criticized by the world. Before resigning from the Privy Council, he joined the government as Postmaster General after the collapse of the coalition government led by Lloyd George. Because of his rich financial knowledge, he was transferred to the post of Minister of Finance in 1923, but before he could present the budget, the Conservative government had already failed. The Baldwin cabinet was established at the end of 1924, and he served as Minister of Health, with considerable achievements, until his resignation in 1929. In 1931, the first national government was established. His father served as Minister of Health, but in October of that year, he was transferred to Minister of Finance. In May 1937, Hitler unexpectedly violated his promise and annexed Czechoslovakia. In January 1939, he and Foreign Minister Halifax went to Rome to meet with Mussolini to discuss non-interference in the Western War and the tense relations between Italy and France. On September 1 of the same year, Germany began to invade Poland. In order to fulfill its promise to Poland, Britain declared war on Germany on the 3rd. After the outbreak of the war, he reported on the war situation in the House of Commons from time to time, attended the Supreme Military Conference, and personally went to the front to congratulate the British Expeditionary Force, until his resignation. After Churchill succeeded as Prime Minister, he served as Lord President of the Council, and later resigned due to illness. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>US and Mexico Conduct Negotiations</h3>
<p>Regarding the suggestion of land, nothing was heard. However, diplomatic circles knew that Washington officials and Mexican officials were considering a general solution, which included the following: (1) The United States leased several base locations on one or two coasts from Mexico, on the condition that Mexico's sovereignty in the leased area was not damaged. (2) The rent paid by the United States must provide Mexico with sufficient US dollar foreign exchange, with a surplus after repaying the long-sought purchase price of farmland from the United States. (3) After Camacho took office as President of Mexico, he published a statement announcing the reopening of negotiations between Mexico and Shell Oil Company and Mobil Oil Company to resolve the demands arising from the requisition of their properties in Mexico. (4) The income obtained from leasing the bases to the United States is used by Mexico to pay to the two oil companies. If the difference is determined to be made up for with oil, then it is made up for with oil. (International News, 10th)</p>

<h3>The Chronic Problem of the Thai-Vietnamese Dispute</h3>
<p>According to news in recent days: the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, which has lasted for two months, has recently become increasingly worse; both sides' defense forces have been moving to the border, the national border has been sealed off, and small-scale clashes have occurred. According to unconfirmed reports: Japanese troops in Vietnam are currently negotiating with Thailand about stationing troops or passing through, and Japanese representative to Vietnam Kakuta protested to Vietnamese Governor Decoux on the 2nd of this month about the "anti-Japanese" trend in Saigon. Combining the above situations, it is enough to show that a new crisis is brewing in the South Asian situation, and the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is like a fatal cancer among them.</p>
<p>This "dispute" began to be exposed on September 13, just when the Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations were protracted and unresolved, and the Japanese side mobilized its forces to implement coercion against French Vietnam: The Thai side suddenly submitted a note to the French Minister to Thailand, requesting three things: 1. Define the deepest part of the Mekong River as the national border, and implement the return of the 43 small islands of lost Thai land that France had agreed to cede to the Thai side; 2. Define the area of ​​Luang Prabang and part of North Sa where Thai people live to Thailand; 3. If the French government is unable to rule Vietnam, the Thai government requests the return of the land of Laos that was lost in the past. The Thai side also stated that if the French-Vietnamese authorities do not give a satisfactory answer, they will abandon the Franco-Thai Non-Aggression Pact concluded on June 12 of this year. At that time, French-Vietnam was suffering from dealing with Japanese demands, and only had the ability to deal with Thailand perfunctorily and delay, while the Thai side was aggressive and threatened with war preparations. It was not until the Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations came to a temporary end that the Vichy side submitted a reply on October 14, rejecting the Thai side's territorial demands based on the provisions of the 1907 treaty between the two countries regarding avoiding the submission of any new territorial demands, and stated that it would approve the non-aggression treaty with Thailand, but agreed to establish a mixed commission in accordance with the provisions of the non-aggression treaty to resolve the Mekong River issue. The anti-French-Vietnamese mass movement of the Thai side reached a heated state in mid-October. Recently, French military commander in Vietnam General Martin resigned and returned home, and he was invited by the Thai Prime Minister to travel to Bangkok to meet with him on his return journey, which seemed to be a side use of the Thai side to seek a solution; and because the French side's minister to Thailand advocated accepting the Thai side's demands, he was ordered to return home, which again showed the French attitude of firmness, with little room for concession. Although Vichy special envoy Calon recently went to Bangkok for contact and expressed optimism, but looking at the development in recent days, there is no sign of any solution. At a time when the situation in the South Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, the long-term lack of resolution of this dispute is a great misfortune for France, Vietnam, Thailand, and all countries that have close interests in South Asia; only those who attempt to profit from it fear that the world will not be in chaos. Looking at the so-called Indochina Peninsula, although it is divided into three parts: Vietnam, Siam, and Burma, its area is only one million square kilometers, but the ethnic differences and historical complexities are by no means simpler than the Baltic Sea coast or the Balkan Peninsula in Europe; and the evolution of the separation and combination of the countries and the succession of territorial affiliations are difficult even for historians to understand; therefore, it is difficult to judge the fundamental right and wrong of the disputes about this territorial issue: This is never an appropriate time to resolve such historical disputes when the Far East is full of crises. The Thai people's concept of never forgetting lost land is originally worthy of sympathy, but the cession of this territory is now nearly forty years ago, and there have been previous statements to France that there will be no more territorial demands, but recently, it suddenly regards this as a problem that can no longer be tolerated, and insists on immediately achieving the goal of restoring the land, which is naturally due to the Thai government's vigorous implementation of nationalist policies, and the "friendly country" that has been deeply associated with Thailand for many years is exerting pressure on French Vietnam, and even if the Thai land demands on French Vietnam are instigated by its "friendly country," it will inevitably receive its strong support to echo it and coerce French Vietnam to fulfill its great desire to encompass Vietnam. Therefore, the objective task played by Thailand here is similar to that of Poland and Hungary in the Sudetenland negotiations, and Thailand's own situation and its future are very similar to Poland's in those days. Frankly speaking, the Thai side is of course not completely unaware of the current crisis-ridden situation, such as the recent Thai special envoy group went to Japan for contact, and it is reported that "the affairs it is engaged in have achieved excellent results"; but at the same time, the Thai Minister of Justice led another delegation of five people to visit British Malaya and Burma, India, and Australia to promote their goodwill mission, and the separate contact between the two delegations and Britain and Japan is enough to show the painstaking efforts of the Thai authorities to re-establish a new balance between Japan and the Central Government on the Indochina Peninsula after the defeat of France. For example, the news that Thailand planned to join the Three-Power Alliance, and the rumor that the Japanese army used Thai territory to attack the Burma Road, were immediately denied by the Thai authorities, expressing their neutral stance. By analogy, it is enough to show that even if the so-called Japanese army intends to station troops or pass through Thailand, the Thai side may not easily agree to it for its own safety. But if the current dispute with French Vietnam persists, or even turns to war, then third parties will inevitably take further action on the pretext of the "New Order in East Asia"; this view has been publicly touted in a certain newspaper some time ago. Therefore, Thailand's insistence on land demands proves to be extremely unwise.</p>
<p>From another point of view, the French-Vietnamese authorities' maintenance of the integrity of Vietnam's territorial sovereignty has completely succumbed to the strong beams, and they have resolutely rejected the Thai side's relatively reasonable demands, which is undoubtedly to convince the Thai people. At present, in addition to hoping that both the Thai and French sides can understand the great difficulties in the future, rein in the horse on the cliff, make concessions to each other, and do not go too far, it is also hoped that both sides will try to arbitrate so that the sparks of the stars will not eventually lead to a prairie fire.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreating South on Yongqin Road Heavily Attacked by Chinese Army, Part of the Remaining Japanese Troops Cover the Retreat, Japanese Aircraft Escort Japanese Military Officers</h3>
<p>Nanning: After the Chinese army conquered important strongholds south of Pingleqiao on the Yongqin Road, a part of the remaining Japanese troops occupied Height 25 and are trying to cover the retreat. The Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack. (10th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to the war report of the Chinese Command in Liuzhou, the Japanese army, which has been retreating south along the Yongqin Highway from Nanning since November 1, has encountered Chinese guerrillas on the southern border of the Shiwan Mountains. The war in other stars is still going on. A large number of Japanese aircraft are now escorting the retreating Japanese army and officials loyal to Nanjing. Japanese aircraft bombed the villagers, claiming that they were all guerrillas, but at night, the real guerrillas rose up to attack the retreating Japanese army, and the Chinese mobile troops also engaged in battle with the Japanese army. It is reported that more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed and many were injured. According to Japanese sources, Japanese aircraft bombed the Chinese army advancing towards Nanning on October 25 and 27, which proves that the Japanese army's retreat from Nanning was due to the Chinese army's pressure from north to south. Two divisions of the Guangdong army participated in the counterattack against Nanning, most of whom had participated in the Battle of the Longhai Railway and had fought on the front line in Jiangxi under the command of General Li Hanhun. They are now under the command of General Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of Guangxi. People here believe that the Japanese army withdrawing from Nanning may first be transferred to Hainan Island for a short rest and then transferred abroad for service. However, senior Chinese generals in Shaoguan predict that these Japanese troops may return to Guangdong and advance with Xu Guan (transliteration). A small number of Japanese troops, who have participated in many battles, may be repatriated to Japan. (International News Service, 10th)</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Victory for Greek Army in Pindus Mountains: Elite Italian Division Annihilated; Either Captured or Died of Hunger and Cold</h3>

According to the Greek side, most of the soldiers of the annihilated Italian division drowned while trying to cross the Aoos River. The forests of the Pindus Mountains are full of the bodies of Italian soldiers who died of hunger and cold or were killed by wild animals. Many Italian soldiers have either died or been captured, and the Greek army has seized a large amount of military equipment. (International News Agency Report on the 10th)</p>

<p>Greece Completes National Mobilization: 500,000 Troops Defend Against the Enemy</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent in Greece reports that Greece's mobilization is now complete, with 500,000 troops engaged in defense. The Greek military authorities are very satisfied with this achievement in the first half-month since the outbreak of the war. So far, those in contact on the battlefield have been Greek outposts and a larger number of Italian troops who lack the will to fight. It is now expected that there will not be a major battle before next week. The Italian army has made slight progress on the main Greek defense line only in Western Epirus, but the Greek defense line there was not originally planned to defend the basin. The Greek army's advance and retreat are entirely in accordance with strategic plans. The Greek outposts in the Florina area have improved their position by capturing a plateau, which can control Koriça and its important transportation lines. More than 2,000 Italian Alpine soldiers were captured when they broke into the core defense line. Although the Greek air force is small in number, it is very brave in combat. Together with the land-based anti-aircraft artillery and British aircraft, it has made remarkable achievements. Currently, the ratio of air force losses between the two sides is nine Italian to one British/Greek. Italian aircraft now dare not fly low to directly attack any military targets.

<h3>German Authorities Consider Evacuating Nationals from Greece: Continued Italian Defeats Damage Axis Prestige; May Assist in Attacking Greece to Reverse the Decline</h3>
<p>Thessaloniki: German authorities have proposed that all German nationals in Greece leave the country. No reason has been officially given for the departure, but observers generally believe that this is a prelude to the Nazi Party assisting Italy in attacking Greece. The slow progress of the Italian attack on Greece has already greatly damaged the reputation of the Axis powers' blitzkrieg. Therefore, observers have long speculated that Hitler will assist Italy in order to restore the credibility of the Axis powers. (United Press Report on the 10th)</p>
<h3>British Convoy Attacked: Minor Losses; British Admiralty Issues Statement</h3>
<p>London: The British Admiralty has issued a statement refuting the German headquarters' claim that German naval raiders destroyed a British convoy of 86,000 tons in the North Atlantic, saying that on November 5th, a British ship team was attacked by a surface enemy raider. It can now be said that many British ships escaped safely, but the remaining details are not yet known due to the need to maintain radio silence. Another Admiralty statement said that according to the report of the British submarine "Catfish," while patrolling the sea and ambushing coastal enemy ships, it saw two enemy supply ships and attacked and destroyed them. A third naval report said that two enemy Junkers dive bombers that attacked ships in the Thames Estuary on Friday were destroyed by the fire of the British ship "Winchester." At that time, one British 900-ton empty ship was sunk by enemy aircraft, and another merchant ship of 2,700 tons was injured but remained safely in port. No other British ships were damaged. The British submarine H49 is overdue and may have been lost. (Reuters Report on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Canadian Mail Ship "Empress of Japan" Reported Bombed</h3>
<p>New York: According to unconfirmed news from Japan, the 26,000-ton "Empress of Japan" of the Changxing Shipping Company was bombed in the North Atlantic, and the ship was damaged and unable to sail.

<p>Stockholm: According to news from New York, a Japanese ship received a distress signal from the "Empress of Britain," which has a displacement of 26,032 tons. Therefore, it is generally believed that the 25,000-ton merchant ship mentioned in the German war report as having been hit by a bomb may be the "Empress of Japan," but it is still difficult to determine.

<h3>Free French Troops Land in Gabon, French Congo: "Battle of Dakar Port" Re-enacted; French Submarine Scuttled Itself</h3>
<p>Vichy: Outside the major Atlantic port of Libreville in French Congo, a second "Battle of Dakar Port" reportedly re-enacted last night, as the "Free French Expeditionary Force," protected by British warships, landed near the city on the African coast. The Vichy government's colonial ministry announced that troops belonging to General de Gaulle have landed in the Gabon region of the Congo, part of Equatorial Africa. The landing force was "covered by a light fleet." Although the battle is underway, the details have not been learned. Government circles expressed extreme tension over the outcome of General de Gaulle's forces' battle with the French colonies in Africa loyal to the Vichy government, as this is the second attempt by the Free French to occupy the French colonies loyal to the Vichy government in Africa by force. The first attempt to land at Dakar Port was unsuccessful. The British government said that the British and "Free French" forces did not want to fight the French, so they retreated as soon as they encountered resistance. However, British newspapers have heavily criticized this move as a "major failure of Dakar Port." (International News Agency Report on the 10th)</p>
<p>London: According to news from Brazzaville, Africa, the Vichy government's submarine Poncelet scuttled itself near Gabon port yesterday when the Free French forces arrived. There was no war between the two sides, and all the crew members were rescued. It is reported that the Free French forces are currently patrolling the area around Libreville. Of all the ports in French Equatorial Africa that are still under the control of the Vichy government, only Libreville remains. The Admiralty issued a statement denying reports that British warships shelled Libreville, saying that the Vichy government's announcement that the British fleet shelled Libreville and assisted the Free French forces in landing was completely untrue. The only action related to the British fleet was to resist the French submarine Poncelet's attempt to sink a British ship without warning. The submarine surfaced and scuttled itself after the British fleet took retaliatory action. (Reuters Report on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Young Reveals Japanese Secrets in US Speech: Friction Between Army and Navy; Difficulties in Invading China; German-Japanese Treaty Cannot Last</h3>
<p>Washington: Mr. Young, a foreign reporter who had been stationed in Tokyo for many years, sent news that the Japanese army was dissatisfied with to the United States, resulting in him being imprisoned for 61 days. Young said in a speech to the public in Baltimore yesterday that Japan is afraid of the United States and the Soviet Union, and Japan is not a threat to the United States. The so-called new order in Japan is just a new stench, with the smell of bombing, bribery, speculation, and narcotics. Some people think that Japan is united, but this is not the case. What makes up this complex Japan are five warlords, two major political parties, a newspaper with good sales and a tendency toward democracy, a public that expresses resentment, and merchants who are kept to support the war. Young also said that the Japanese police have fourth-rate knowledge. They arrest you and want to know what you are thinking. If you do not express your thoughts, they detain you for continued interrogation. If you express your thoughts, they will detain you for six months or a year. Young spoke about German-Japanese trade relations, saying that Germany and Japan are deceiving each other and do not trust each other. Even if there is a treaty, it will not last. Young also detailed the friction between the Japanese army and navy and the difficulties in Japan's war against China, saying that many Chinese leaders, if they could save face, would like to clean up the mess and return to their country as soon as possible, because China will never surrender to Japan. Young praised the work of US Ambassador to Japan Grew, saying that the position of ambassador to Japan is extremely difficult. Grew maintained his position as an envoy and resisted the public. He is a first-rate person. Young also described to the audience the situation of his 61 days in a Tokyo prison. (Reuters Report on the 10th)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Displays Power: Bombing German and Italian Territories, Munich in Flames Reaching the Sky, Italian Industrial Areas Suffer Major Damage</h3>
<p>London - On Friday night and Saturday morning, British Air Force bombers bombed the railway transportation center of Munich, destroying railway lines, hitting locomotive depots, and starting a large fire in the marshalling yard. The British Air Force's attack on this one target was perhaps the most intense. The attack began shortly after 8:30 p.m. British planes dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the four-mile-long marshalling yard and railway workshops in batches, as dense as raindrops, lasting for two hours. The workshop is the nerve center of Bavaria's extensive electrified railway network. The British planes took off from England, traveled 600 miles to reach Munich. The weather conditions were extremely suitable for bombing, with the bright moonlight quickly finding the tracks, and then dropping bombs. Within minutes, multiple explosions and fires were seen, spreading and burning fiercely. During the first hour of the British air raid, the crisscrossing tracks near the main station, both ends of the six workshops, and long rows of locomotive depots were hit by heavy bombs. Several nearby buildings were damaged by the force of the explosions. When the British bomber crews arrived over Augsburg afterwards, they saw the flames of Munich reaching the sky. On Friday night, British aircraft activity was not limited to long-range attacks and large-scale bombing of Munich, but also bombed many important targets in Germany and the occupied territories. For example, an oil refinery in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr area was attacked. Within two minutes of the first batch of bombs being dropped, several explosions were seen, flashes of white light, followed by a large fire extending 1,500 yards. Two hours later, another oil refinery in the area was hit. Oil depots on the south bank of the Rhine near Frankfurt, and extensive railway targets in Germany, as well as freight yards in Hamm and Cologne, were all heavily bombed. The main railway line outside Saarbrücken was hit, starting a large fire. Buildings near railway sidings in Stuttgart were also hit and exploded. Many other industrial targets were heavily bombed. British aircraft made a low-altitude attack on a large factory in Ulm, seeing it catch fire and billowing smoke. An hour later, a British bomber, on its way back, passed over the area again and saw the large fire still burning. Another large factory near Überlingen on Lake Constance was bombed and damaged. The Siemens-Schuckert plant in Nuremberg was subjected to an hour of intense bombing by British aircraft. When British aircraft attacked the inland port of Duisburg, bombs hit the dock area, and explosions occurred among the ships next to the docks. On the same night, British aircraft launched separate attacks, bombing or strafing twenty enemy airfields. A bomb hit an aircraft hangar at the Tübingen airfield. After the bombing of the airfield in Aust in the Netherlands, smoke rose to a height of 8,000 feet, indicating that the oil depots had been hit and were on fire. When British aircraft attacked the Deelen airfield, they flew low and used machine-gun fire to extinguish the lights, and heavily bombed an enemy plane about to take off. Enemy coastal bases that were attacked at night included Amsterdam, Harlingen, and Vlissingen. A large fire broke out in the Vlissingen shipyard. Harlingen was bombed twice, with bombs hitting ships and buildings. A batch of bombs landed on the nearby railway yard, causing a violent explosion, the force of which greatly shook the British aircraft in the sky. Also on Friday night, a Coastal Command Blenheim bomber heavily bombed Lorient, which had already been severely damaged. The British aircraft flew intermittently to attack, and with clear visibility, finding the targets was not difficult. The bombs dropped hit the docks and naval shipyards, causing successive explosions. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Isles Continue to Suffer Air Raids, Axis Powers Threaten to Retaliate Against Britain</h3>
<p>Berlin - German officials stated today that the British bombing of Munich on Friday night was a deliberate attempt to assassinate Hitler. They also hinted that Germany would soon retaliate on a large scale. The Germans believe that this bombing decision and the bombing last year are closely linked. (International Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Although the weather has been bad for the past two days, German planes still went to Britain to bomb. London, Birmingham, Liverpool, and other cities were all attacked by German planes. German planes continued to drop mines in various ports of the British Isles to obstruct Allied shipping. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian journalist Gayda stated yesterday in "Italian News" that since British planes are bombing Italian civilians, the Italian Air Force will retaliate, taking the same measures against Britain and its allies. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hitler's Speech (Continued)</h3>
<p>Re-arming, I then resolved that unless Germany had not a single soldier, Germany would be at the forefront of the world. I made thorough preparations. Seven million Germans have thus returned to work. The German currency has thus been stabilized. Everyone's life is full. Output has surged. Everything is done according to the principles laid down by the National Socialist Party. The most effective thing in economics is the talent for work and organization. The foundation of the German currency is not gold but production. One day, Churchill will be gone, but Germany will have countless submarines. Churchill's use of the Air Force to fight against the people is the greatest fool in the military world. The air force used by Britain and its bases are the weakest weapons of Britain, and the external environment in terms of geography is also the worst. The German position extends from northern Norway to the coast of Spain. Churchill's use of the Air Force to fight against civilians will never destroy the morale of the German people. In terms of soldiers, we do not need to use reserves. Today's German military appearance is very different from the First World War. Whether it is the navy, army, air force or its weapons, it cannot be compared with 1914. The ammunition we consume is only the amount produced in one month, so the ammunition in storage is extremely large. I had no choice but to order a halt to manufacturing. Have you heard threatening words? The population of Australia, including aborigines, is only six or seven million, but they exaggerated that they would build eight times as many German aircraft. Canada, with only nine million people, will build twelve times as many German aircraft. In terms of US production, it cannot be described with astronomical figures. Regarding this level, I do not want to compete with others.</p>
<p>Industrial Mobilization But there is one thing I can tell you, that is, Germany's output will be the largest in the world, because today the strength we can mobilize is not only Germany, but almost the whole of Europe. I want to develop this strength in the industrial area. You can believe it. For several years, we have been preparing for industrial mobilization, but large-scale production will have to wait for a year or two. We are preparing for the future. In terms of material and personnel preparation, we are constantly improving the world's most distinctive military institution, waiting for the opportunity to strike and achieve the same great results as before. At that time, those who conquer the world with words will encounter our military force. Germany and its allies, in any case, are sufficient to cope with any united force in the world. No force can defeat our force. Our peacetime preparations have now borne fruit. Our four-year plan has now been extended for another four years, which will give us unlimited supplies. This plan makes any blockade a failure. Please see who will be blockaded, us or the enemy? Half a year ago, Churchill said, "We have destroyed half of the enemy's submarines, and after a few months, what the enemy has left will be reduced to 30% and 10%." This lie is not worth arguing about. Now the world has recognized that our submarines are increasing day by day, and the enemy has no way of knowing where they come from. We still have to fight against the liars of international capitalism. There will come a day when Churchill will lose his existence, and the submarines of the Soviet Union will appear there.</p>
<p>Launching the Air Force Implementing the air force strategy is Churchill's ideal. In fact, the strength of the British Air Force is weaker than our country. You all know that I suggested to the world several years ago that we should stop the air force from bombing, allowing it to bomb civilians, but Britain went its own way. However, I still strive not to fight against civilians. As in the Polish War, I did not carry out night raids on Polish cities, but only bombed their military targets during the day. Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, France - in the previous battles, German aircraft only targeted military equipment. British Prime Minister Churchill, after the British Air Force failed to intrude into Germany during the day, suddenly carried out night raids, bombing German civilians. I quietly watched enemy planes bombing civilians in the Rhine area for eight days. After the end of the Western Front battles, I once again expressed my attitude to Britain, but Germany suffered more and more bombings. Halifax has become like a crazy person. The bombing became more and more intense every day, but I still held a wait-and-see attitude. Many of my colleagues asked me how long I would tolerate it. They would never stop automatically. After watching quietly for three months, I could no longer tolerate it, so one day I issued the following order: Britain needs bombing. Britain wants to destroy Germany with air warfare. I have now decided to treat others in the same way.</p>
<p>Belief in Victory See who will be destroyed. Churchill made this great mistake in the military, which cannot be done by soldiers. Although I am not the strongest person in Germany in decades or even hundreds of years, I absolutely believe in my success and firmly believe that this war will achieve the same results in Germany as my struggle in the country. I participated in the previous World War and suffered the deception of the victors, so the end of this war will not be the same as the previous one. This is my unwavering determination.</p>
<p>Exaggerated War Achievements When I addressed you last year, the German army had just begun to fight Poland. As a result, the Polish army collapsed in just eighteen days. At first, other countries thought that the German-Polish war could last for six months or even ten months. The combat power of the German army would be exhausted. During this period, the Western Front could reorganize its army and prepare for war. In the summer of 1940, the Allied forces of Britain and France on the Western Front could take the path of the Netherlands and Belgium and directly advance towards the Ruhr border, gradually controlling Germany's fate. They also predicted that a revolution would occur in Germany. In short, they have been intimidating people with threats for many years, thinking that Germany is also a jackal of the same tribe, but they do not know that Germany has already made full preparations. On November 8 last year, the German army conquered Poland, proving that the enemy's first prediction was not accurate. At the same time, it proved the success of Germany. Today, I have several achievements that can be reported. The German army not only destroyed the enemy in the West in a few weeks, but also occupied part of Norway. It can be said that there is a strong and united front from Kirkenes to the Spanish border. The hopes of the British who are fond of boasting can be said to be completely shattered. They tried to cut off Germany's important transportation lines and gradually starve Germany to death. Unexpectedly, the opposite is true. After Europe understands its own interests, it gradually mobilizes to fight against the enemies of Europe. In a few months, Germany made Europe free. Britain tried to make Europe Balkanized. This plan cannot now be realized. In other words, what Britain wants is to divide or destroy the organization of Europe, while what Germany and Italy want is to organize Europe.</p>
<p>Struggling to the End If Britain wants to say "the war must continue," I also think it doesn't matter, because the war can only continue until we end the war. You can believe that we have the certainty to end the war and achieve victory. In addition, I cannot but say that I do not intend to make predictions. Why? If I had announced to the British on January 1 this year, "(1) The German army will enter Norway, and Britain will not be able to stand in Norway, (2) This summer the British will not be able to live in the Netherlands or come to the Netherlands, and the Germans will occupy it, (3) Belgium and France will be completely changed or no longer exist," the British would unanimously scold me for being a lunatic. Therefore, I still adhere to the policy of not making predictions, and only intend to tell the German people that the war has created unprecedented results. Judging from the number of people killed in this war, the mortality rate is lower than that of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, only half of the number of those killed at that time. When Chamberlain made a peace proposal to me in Munich in 1938, he had already decided to declare immediately after returning to Britain, "I have gained considerable time, and we can expand our military to attack Germany." We know very well that the current truce is only a truce. They may hope that after a few years, I will no longer be the German head of state and can launch another war. Therefore, my unchangeable determination will be to continue fighting and achieve a clear decision. They need war, and the German people will fight to the end.</p>
<p>Seeking to Achieve the Goal The crisis of reopening the war in a year or two must be eliminated. The German people must live in peace. This peace will allow them to work and not allow international thugs to instigate other countries to fight against Germany and use war as a strategy for profit. I am not fighting for material interests. I think that war is dangerous and costly, wasting our time and working ability. If we can continue to work, I will be very happy. National Socialism has produced the spirit of German military victory. psychological. The pre-conditions of morality and material. The current German army is a revolutionary army. German soldiers not only remember the past Germany, but also yearn for the future Germany. They fight to realize a better Germany and complete our national and social movement.</p>
<p>Remembering the Martyrs</p>
<p>Germany's current achievements are all thanks to those who started the uprising in 1923 and those who sacrificed. They first shed blood for the National Socialist movement. In the following decade, domestic and foreign revolutionaries followed the sixteen martyrs and sacrificed hundreds of people for the country, and the struggles in Austria and the Sudetenland were magnificent. These struggles all originated on November 8 and 9, 1923. We sincerely commemorate the martyrs and realize the will of the martyrs. Germany will win the final victory in the current European war.

<h3>When Japanese Troops Occupied Nanning, Foreign Missionaries' External Communications Were Cut Off, Letters, Books, Magazines, Etc. Were All Confiscated, French Bishop Did Not Know the Current Situation in France</h3>
<p>Nanning - During the Japanese occupation of Nanning, pressure was exerted on foreign missionaries residing in the city. All contact with the outside world was strictly prohibited. All incoming and outgoing letters, telegrams, and various informative books and magazines were confiscated. When the Vietnam issue arose, the Japanese troops even regarded French Bishop Shen Shijie of the Catholic Church, Father Peng Junyi, and Tang Yuqiu as prisoners. When the Yunnan-Burma Road opened, they insulted British pastor Ou Xian Guang of the Gospel Church and British doctor Huang Jue Min of the church's affiliated hospital. For eleven months, their lives were like being in prison, and their movements were restricted. When the reporter visited Bishop Shen and talked about the French defeat and the invasion of Vietnam, he still knew nothing about it. He couldn't help but cry when he heard the news. According to reports, when the county seat fell, Mr. Shen sheltered 360 righteous people in the Catholic Church, and the pastor of Fuxiang Church also sheltered more than 130 people. Until the Chinese army entered the city, these righteous people still lived safely in the church. Their enthusiasm is admirable. (Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(A Glimpse of Nanning City After the Calamity)</p>
<p>In the imagination of the general reader, after eleven months and six days of trampling by iron hooves, after two destructions of artillery fire during the fall and recapture, and finally after the destruction and burning by the retreating Japanese, Nanning must be in a terrible state. At the same time, in the imagination of another group of readers, Nanning is the only big city in southern Guangxi. Under the long-term rule of the Japanese, it has become a large smuggling port. In order to ensure the dumping of its goods and to attract corrupt merchants, the Japanese would dress up the city like a flower, and anesthetize the obedient people as docile as cattle and sheep. Even when the Japanese withdrew, there was bound to be a mess. However, the centipede dies but does not fall, and even though the essence is damaged, the scene is still there. Therefore, in the imagination of the general reader, the recaptured Nanning must still be quite prosperous, and even if it is a bit deserted, it can be restored immediately. These two ideas are correct in common sense. The reporter and all other travelers had thought so before entering Nanning, thinking that it would not go beyond the above two points. But in fact, the current Nanning appeared in a third posture: emptiness, decay, and desolation, which is a fitting portrayal of this posture.</p>
<p>Yes, at any time, morning, noon, or dusk, when you walk through Zhongshan Road, Delin Road, Renai Road, and all other roads, you will not find a scene of rubble, let alone the atmosphere of prosperity. You can't even meet a dog or a cat. What you see are rows of tall or short, empty houses covered with inches of dust, and piles of garbage, swarms of flies and mosquitoes. If it is at night, you will also hear the chirping of insects and the mournful cries of birds. At this time, you will doubt that you are in a remote mountain wilderness. Almost all the damp ground that is open is covered with white flowers, and there are reeds that are one or two feet long. The doors of some tall courtyards are also completely open, and the inside is full of empty cans and scraps of paper. That is where the Japanese once lived.</p>
<p>It is not only empty, decayed, and desolate here. On some streets and in some residences, there is also terror. Because when people retreated, they buried a lot of landmines. In some places, they would deliberately play tricks, lifting a piece of floating soil on the ground and inserting an iron wire, causing you to have a dangerous panic. In some exquisite houses, they placed valuable food or other things, tempting people to take them. Facts have proved that there are indeed landmines in these places. A squad leader of a certain division found a house with biscuits piled up in the window. The window was tied, and the door was closed, but not locked. At this time, he became very witty, walked away more than ten steps, lay down on the ground, and used a long bamboo pole to push the door. With a bang, the door was blown to pieces, and the house was filled with smoke and biscuit fragments. He laughed, and then in two minutes, he picked up the biscuits in the house. These memorable foods must have been tasted. A female colleague even collected a package and prepared to send it back to her relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Now, a week after we entered the city, the situation has changed. The dirt and filth in the streets and courtyards have been partially cleaned. After the general search by the engineers, the words "(Danger cleared)" are written in white on the front of each house. Some shop signs are starting to be painted, and some are writing on the door panels that someone has returned, or asking someone to go home quickly, etc. These are all enthusiastic but poignant summons.</p>
<p>Nanning was a ghost world ten days ago, and a dead city a week ago. After the blood transfusion of thousands of male and female athletes, it has begun to recover. After December 28, except for the five hundred and ten righteous people who took refuge in the Catholic Church and the Gospel Church, there was no Chinese in the entire city. This is a phenomenon that no city occupied by the Japanese has experienced.</p>
<p>The Japanese expelled the citizens of Nanning City, and at the same time suffocated themselves. Because I couldn't find anything to eat in Nanning City. Due to the frequent illnesses of the soldiers, even if there was something, they didn't dare to eat it. Therefore, all food, even water, relied on overseas aid.</p>
<p>Where did the expelled citizens go? Is the so-called Japanese special rule to rule this city? It turns out that the Japanese have opened up another (new provincial capital). That place is Yingxin Market, thirteen kilometers northwest of Nanning. This place is not big, but it has become a substitute for Nanning, becoming the political and economic center of the Japanese rule of Nanning. All the citizens who were expelled from Nanning were imprisoned there for the Japanese to mock.</p>
<p>Yingxin Market is located on the north bank of the Yongjiang River, west of Yongwu Road, and parallel to Santang on Yongwu Road from east to west. There are more than a hundred civilian houses and two rows of houses in the market, forming a street. The market is surrounded by barbed wire. It is said that on his prosperous Daishan Street, everything is sold. Japanese goods are everywhere, and many corrupt merchants are smuggling, all of which are traded there. The armed forces under the wings of the Japanese are responsible for armed delivery.</p>
<p>Yingxin Market is the political and economic center of the Japanese in Nanning, then Nanning is the military center of the Japanese. In fact, it is so. After expelling the citizens, Nanning is only allowed to station troops and is not allowed to engage in any commerce. In the Nanning area, in addition to three or five Japanese-run restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and comfort stations for soldiers' entertainment, all Japanese merchants who operate businesses under military protection are limited to trading in Yingxin Market. (Of course, the digestion of Yingxin Market is terribly small, and it does not trust Nanning City. What does this mean? This means that after the failure of the Japanese plan to prosper Nanning City, they no longer attach importance to the marketability of the Guinan occupied area. This is also the economic factor behind the later withdrawal of the Japanese from the Guinan battlefield. (Central News Agency Telegram, 10th, Liu Zhuzhou)</p>

<h3>Yunnan-Burma Road Unobstructed</h3>
<p>Kunming - Although the Salween River Bridge (i.e., Nujiang) and the Mekong River Bridge have been damaged by repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft, the Yunnan-Burma Road is still passable, and transportation through these two places is still smooth. The reporter arrived safely in Kunming today after an eight-day trip from Lashio by supply truck. The journey was very fast and there were no air raids. On Tuesday, the reporter passed over the 80-meter-long Salween River Bridge. Transportation vehicles can still pass over the bridge if they slow down and drive cautiously. According to the head of the repair project, Japanese aircraft bombed the bridge on both October 28 and 29, but the bridge was repaired six hours after the air raid and could be used for traffic. The bridge cables and auxiliary cables of the Salween River Bridge were broken by the bombing, but the two main cables were still undamaged. On Monday, the reporter also passed over the Mekong River Bridge, which had been severely damaged several times. However, after repairs, the bridge is as strong as a piece of steel.

<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3>The Principles of Love Between Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The Flourishing of Reproductive Glands is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>The principle of love between men and women can be said to stem from the physiological and psychological integration. If the development of the reproductive organs is incomplete, then sexual desire also lacks soundness. The purpose of the reproductive function is to allow the sperm of a man to combine with the egg of a woman to produce a new individual, and the principle of love between men and women lies therein. However, upon careful observation of humans, the development of sexual desire and reproductive organs is often not well-coordinated. Humans experience feelings of love and sexual desire long before their reproductive organs mature. Children whose reproductive organs have not yet matured frequently develop feelings of love for the opposite sex, which is evident. It is a strange phenomenon that children whose reproductive organs have not matured already know to love the opposite sex, so it is not surprising that children masturbate. However, this greatly affects their physical and mental health, as it is caused by engaging in sexual behavior before the reproductive organs have matured.</p>
<p>If one masturbates or indulges in excessive sexual activity during development, the reproductive glands will be greatly damaged, resulting in conditions such as spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. Early marriage is also the same. Such people experience various problems in their proper sexual life, the common ones being premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development. Consequently, harmonious marriages are often ruined. Therefore, one should practice restraint during development and avoid licentiousness. If you feel physically weak and your health level is low, you should supplement it with "Körpertonikum" (Body Tonic), a German reproductive gland hormone preparation for men. The ingredients of "Körpertonikum" are entirely extracted from the reproductive glands of animals, their essence extracted using scientific methods, and mixed with mineral and plant ingredients beneficial to the human body. It has the effects of nourishing the brain, blood, kidneys, and essence. If you are injured by masturbation, taking this preparation can restore your original strength, guaranteeing essence replenishment and kidney nourishment within 24 hours. The elderly who take this have the effect of rejuvenating. The women's "Körpertonikum" is a highly effective medicine for treating irregular menstruation, anemia, and premature aging, and is truly a treasure for health!</p>
<h3>Proven Treatment for Masturbation and Licentiousness</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Patient Ling Qichun, 25 years old, from Yibo, works in a hotel. (Self-report) Due to my weak willpower, I started masturbating at the age of seventeen, and it became a habit over time. Later, I experienced frequent spermatorrhea and a pale complexion. Later, I had an affair with a promiscuous woman from my hometown, which made my body even more battered. Although we have separated now, I have already contracted kidney deficiency and other illnesses. (Symptoms) Poor appetite, spermatorrhea three or four times a week, foggy mind, premature ejaculation, small local size. (Treatment) 15 minutes of electrotherapy daily, taking "Nervines Spermatorrhea Pills" to stop spermatorrhea, and actively purchasing and taking the testicular essence preparation "Körpertonikum" to nourish the deficiencies and treat neurasthenia and kidney deficiency. After taking it for a month, I felt refreshed, energetic, and the spermatorrhea had stopped. By the second month, my appetite had increased, my complexion was rosy, and premature ejaculation was gone. By the third month, all symptoms had disappeared. Upon checking my weight, I had gained nine pounds, and my erectile power was strong. Theoretically, I could stop taking it, but Mr. Ling, seeing the great nourishing power of "Körpertonikum," continued to take it to nourish his deficiencies. In total, he took it for half a year, and his weight reached 118 pounds. Mr. Ling weighed only 101 pounds before treatment.</p>

<h3>A Painful History of the European War (2) – The Great Tragedy of France</h3>
<p>Since May 16th, the British military authorities had felt indignant towards the Allied Headquarters. When General Weygand took over, General Ironside, the British Chief of Staff, while expressing his acceptance, stated that the situation was serious and that he had to consider independent action to protect the British forces in the Flanders area. On May 20th, five German armored divisions and several mechanized divisions had crossed the Meuse River. At that time, General Ironside was returning to London from France, holding meetings with staff in the War Office. Several French military liaison officers sat on iron beds, next to General Ironside's desk, simply wanting to never leave the maps and telephones, even in their dreams. General Ironside's large leather boots were also placed at the foot of the bed, ready to be worn at any time. A map of Flanders was laid out on the table, with two photos placed on either side: one of Mrs. Ironside's beautiful portrait, and one of the general's beautiful young daughter. It was at this time and place that General Ironside decided to launch a major counter-offensive along the Somme River. The French officers nodded in agreement, and said that General Blanchard's mechanized division and part of the First Army could assist the attack on the left flank.</p>
<p>With no worries about the rear, the German army prepared to attack the Somme River front line without stopping for a moment. From the first day, Weygand called this battle "The Battle of France." On May 29th, at a cabinet meeting, he openly stated that the Battle of the Somme was the final battle, and that he was prepared to use all reserves and mobilize all manpower and material resources to make a desperate gamble. There could be no further retreat after this. Weygand explained to the ministers: "In modern warfare, a retreating army is a defeated army, because the pursuing army advances faster than the retreating army. Retreat cannot preserve weapons, nor can it maintain a continuous front line. In modern warfare, if you don't retreat, that's fine, but once you retreat, it's impossible to recover."</p>
<p>On June 1st, when Churchill flew to Paris to participate in the Allied Supreme Council, Weygand reiterated this statement. He pressured Churchill for greater assistance. On June 4th, Dunkirk fell, and at dawn that day, the German army's major offensive on the Somme River began.</p>
<p>On the first day, the French army was able to hold the entire line despite incredibly intense artillery fire. Weygand expressed satisfaction. Reynaud used "a glimmer of hope" as the title of his broadcast. On June 6th, most French people still believed that France would be able to recreate a miracle in history, stop the enemy, and achieve final victory.</p>
<p>At the same time, Reynaud eliminated all the weak elements in the cabinet, starting with Daladier. He promoted Baudouin to Foreign Minister, and appointed the fifty-year-old General Touchon as Minister of War. Baudouin was a behind-the-scenes figure with great potential influence, who had been involved in politics and business for fifty years without being tainted by the bad habits of the political world. General Touchon, on the other hand, had always been a believer in mechanized armored divisions and offensive air power, and had only been promoted to the rank of general twelve days prior.</p>
<p>However, after inspecting the front lines, General Weygand had devised another plan, on a grander scale, by which the Flanders army could perhaps be saved entirely. To this end, he had to mobilize all the reserves. When he heard that a portion of the troops he urgently needed had to assist Ironside's operational plan, and that French General Billotte had also agreed, he stamped his feet in anger, scolding Billotte for making a decision without authorization. At the same time, he declared to the British army that the French army had other uses and could not assist, and asked them not to attempt a lone attack. Unfortunately, it was too late, and the British army's offensive had already begun. This offensive was initially quite successful, but soon encountered strong resistance, and the British army was forced to retreat, even behind its original line.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, Billotte told King Leopold III of Belgium and British General Gort about Weygand's plan in Ypres. The plan stipulated that the French army would be in the north and the British army in the south, launching a joint attack on May 26th in order to cross the Somme River and re-establish contact between the British and French armies. Although this plan was extremely dangerous, it was probably the only way to save France. Unfortunately, General Billotte, who was responsible for commanding the northern campaign, died in a car accident on May 28th. On May 25th, the Belgian army also retreated from north to south, saying that they were being excessively pressured by the German army. Fearing complete isolation from its allies, the British army sent two divisions to occupy the border towns of Belgium in order to maintain contact with General Blanchard, who had replaced Billotte. Blanchard told Gort: "The Belgian army is preparing to retreat." Gort immediately informed Ironside. Ironside instructed Gort to "prepare on your own."</p>
<p>A few hours before the British and French armies began their counter-offensive, Belgium surrendered. At eight o'clock in the morning on May 28th, Reynaud reported briefly on the radio: "Leopold of Belgium first sought help from me, but now, in the midst of battle, he has surrendered to the enemy without a word to Britain and France. The road to Dunkirk is now wide open." The first batch of British troops began to withdraw from the Lys River, boarding ships between Ostend and Dunkirk. Unable to support itself, the French army also had to decide to find a way to board ships and withdraw. They abandoned all their guns, equipment, and even the mechanical equipment of the mechanized divisions.</p>
<p>An optimistic atmosphere continued until June 9th. During these few days, Reynaud sent his first urgent telegram to President Roosevelt, requesting American assistance. Weygand even declared in a military order: "The enemy has suffered heavy losses and is exhausted. Our army has reached the last quarter of an hour of the battle. Hold on!"</p>
<p>However, Weygand had exhausted all his resources, mobilizing troops from behind the Maginot Line, and disregarding the threat of the Italian army, mobilizing the front-line troops from the Alsace area. In total, he had only about forty divisions. The number of German troops, however, increased day by day, reaching more than one hundred divisions, concentrated on a one-hundred-mile-long front line. The German army had forty divisions on the Vas River side, ten divisions opposite Soissons, and forty divisions on the upper reaches of the Aisne River and in the Champagne area, not counting the armored divisions guarding the Siegfried Line and preparing to launch an offensive on the Swiss border.</p>
<p>Day and night, the French army defended against the German army without closing their eyes. The battle never ceased, and every morning they saw a fresh wave of German troops surging in. The French army finally collapsed. The German army broke through Abbeville, and the defending troops there, a Scottish division, the last British division stationed in France, also collapsed. In despair, Weygand attempted to build a new line of defense, but it was to no avail. He warned the government to leave Paris immediately. On the evening of June 9th, thousands of trucks moved important files from various departments. Government officials took their families with them. The vehicles snaked endlessly. Those who did not escape to Tours by car traveled by special train. Even the General Headquarters moved 120 miles to the south.</p>
<p>On June 10th, Reynaud accompanied Weygand to inspect the front lines. Two days later, these two military and political leaders returned to the General Headquarters in the village of Briare on the Loire River. They argued fiercely, and finally Weygand said: "Everything is over. We must stop the war immediately to avoid the worst possible outcome."</p>
<p>On June 11th, Italy declared war on France. But Mussolini's move no longer affected the course of events, and the French side was indifferent to it. On June 12th, Reynaud returned to Tours, refusing to compromise, saying, "The soul of France has not been extinguished!" He had a long talk with Pétain, trying to get him to be his comrade. But Pétain was even more determined than Weygand, saying: "Since there is no longer any hope militarily, we have no choice but to stop the war."</p>
<p>Reynaud picked up the phone and asked Churchill to come quickly, and at the same time convened a cabinet, holding an emergency meeting at the police station. The ministers looked flustered, anxious, and extraordinarily impatient. They shook hands with each other, and before they could finish their greetings, they rushed to talk to others. As the meeting began, bombs exploded all around Tours.</p>
<p>Reynaud announced to the cabinet that they would fight to the end at any cost. Mandel and General Touchon both expressed their support. Touchon even suggested moving the government to Brighton, so that "the French army could hold the line there, and there would be a way to the sea, so they could get overseas supplies." But no one agreed with this proposal. Navy Minister Campinchi and Aviation Minister Laurent-Eynac advocated moving to the North African colonies.</p>
<p>Before long, Pétain slowly stood up and said: "All these speeches are of no practical use. The time is past. The deeper the German army advances, the harsher the conditions will be. While our navy is still intact, part of the army has not yet collapsed, and the Maginot Line has not yet fallen, it is better to ask for a truce immediately. If we delay any longer, we will have to obey the victors in everything." Information Minister Frossard and Chautemps both agreed with Pétain's opinion, as did Baudouin.</p>
<p>In the midst of the discussion, it was suddenly reported that Churchill had arrived, and the meeting was temporarily interrupted. Churchill was shocked when he heard the report. He pleaded: "Hold on for another forty-eight hours. Tomorrow night, I will send a thousand bombers to help, and I will send troops and equipment as soon as possible." (Two nights later, five hundred British bombers did attack the German advance, but to no effect.)</p>
<p>Another meeting was held that night, presided over by President Lebrun himself. It was pitch black along the streets, and the refugees were crowded. The ministers sat in cars, driving windingly from Tours to the Château de Cangé, a few miles away, which was temporarily serving as the presidential residence. Weygand stepped into the meeting room, his face pale, his nerves agitated, and spoke in silence:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, standing before you is a disgraced soldier, a defeated general. We have no choice but to surrender." When the French authorities heard this great man's call for an armistice, they felt the weight of their responsibilities and could not help but tremble in fear. Frossard even burst into tears, and the others were also tearful.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted all night, only deciding to declare Paris an open city, because even if they tried their best to defend it, it would only turn the famous city into scorched earth, and only stop the German army for a day or two. Soon, Tours was also threatened, and the government decided to relocate once again, moving to Bordeaux on June 14th, while the German army took Paris by surprise. (To be continued)</p>

After eight minutes, Youliang kicked into the goal, Kehou headed it, and Tai caught it, dribbled a few steps, and shot fiercely, scoring a goal successfully! 1-0! Applause thunderously erupted from all four sides. The Portuguese merchants launched a fierce counterattack. Three minutes later, they actually came to the city walls. Li Ning, eager to rescue, fouled, resulting in a penalty kick. Unexpectedly, Tung Wah was blessed by the heavens, and Costa missed the shot, hitting the crossbar. Tung Wah narrowly escaped. Two minutes later, Huang Kehou passed to Wan Jin, who passed to Youliang, eventually reaching the feet of the strange-footed Li Yichen. With the distance so close, Su Ruo had no way to save it. The score increased to 2-0. In the first half, Tung Wah maintained a 2-0 lead.</p>

<p>Continuing the battle, Guião launched a surprise attack, but fortunately it was unsuccessful. Not long after, Qin Bi Gao saved another dangerous shot. At that time, the Portuguese army surrounded the penalty area. Fortunately, Bi Gao defended strongly without losing. After 18 minutes of stalemate, Tai got a wonderful pass from Kehou, turned to the right, and shot from 30 yards outside the right corner, hitting the right corner of the goal with extreme clarity, to the delight of the spectators. Tung Wah thus cut through three barriers in a row. The Portuguese merchants counterattacked desperately, but fortunately no accidents occurred. Time flew by like an arrow. There were only two minutes left, hoping to reach the end safely, but unexpectedly, after Han Longhai kicked a corner kick, Plata kicked it at an excellent angle, causing it to hit the post and bounce into the net. Bi Gao was caught off guard, and the Portuguese merchants managed to pull back one goal, making it 1-2, thus avoiding total annihilation. After the kick-off in the center line, the whistle had already blown before long. Tung Wah won 3-1!</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Soviet Sports - 26 World Weightlifting Records Created - Many New Swimming Records Also Created</h3>
<p>(TASS) In weightlifting, there are a total of 35 world records, of which 26 were created by Soviet athletes. Germany accounts for 5 of the remaining 9, and the UK, France, Japan, and Egypt each account for 1. Weightlifting is extremely popular in the Soviet Union, with no fewer than 25,000 participants.</p>
<p>The Soviet women's lightweight sports meeting javelin champion achieved a score of 38.46 meters (TASS)</p>
<p>The Soviet summer sports have ended, and the final program was the Voroshilov cross-country race. Eleven years ago, only 126 people participated in this race, but currently the number of participants has reached 100,000, which is enough to show the speed of Soviet sports development. This year's cross-country race was 10 kilometers long, and the champion was Red Army soldier Fan Ning, with a score of 31 minutes and 24 seconds, breaking last year's record. Also, in the summer sports, Soviet athletes created a total of 39 national records and 2 European records (long jump 7.46 meters, pole vault 4.26 meters).</p>
<p>As for swimming, Bauzhengo broke the world record for the 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2 minutes 33.7 seconds. Soviet swimmers also set a new world record in the 400-meter relay with a time of 3 minutes 57 seconds. In addition, Mashakov's 100-meter freestyle swim was 57.5 seconds, which athletes from various countries around the world have failed to break in the past few years.</p>
<p>Most of the outstanding Soviet athletes are Red Army personnel. They all excel in stamina, which is enough to prove their strength in prolonged battles. In 1937, five Red Army soldiers patrolled the Soviet border by bicycle, covering a distance of 30,878 kilometers in 268 days. Also, last summer, naval personnel traveled by rowing boat from Murmansk to Baku, crossing the White Sea and the Caspian Sea, a total distance of 5,600 kilometers, taking 38 days. In shooting, the Red Army created two world records, and in weightlifting, they repeatedly set ten world records. As for swimming, Red Army and naval personnel can enter the water in any climate and river. Bauzhengo's 100-meter breaststroke was 1 minute 6.8 seconds, and the 200-meter was 2 minutes 33.7 seconds, exceeding the records created by the American Huth and Kastleh.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>— Yu Xielin</p>
<p>To seek victory in war, it is necessary to first consolidate the domestic economy. The maintenance of industry, the promotion of trade, the sufficiency of finance, the management of funds, and the control of prices are all important strategies for the wartime economy. This is true for all countries in the world. However, to seek the effectiveness of the above policies, it is necessary to first seek the proper handling of financial measures. In the three years of our country's war, the government authorities have strived for stability in wartime finance, such as restricting withdrawals, handling discounts, improving local finance, reorganizing local trade, controlling foreign exchange, and promoting frugal savings. Encouraging financial institutions to lend to industry and commerce, organizing the Four Joint Offices, expanding the financial network, and restricting domestic remittances and managing bank funds, etc., the measures taken can be said to be detailed and appropriate. However, due to environmental factors, it has not been possible to fully exert its effectiveness and achieve the goal of financial stability.</p>
<p>The Pathological State of Our Country's Wartime Finance</p>
<p>Now, let's first discuss the difficulties in the financial control of our country's wartime: First, the financial organization is not yet perfect, such as the proliferation of small banks and the improper use of bank funds, so the authorities feel quite difficult to implement financial policies. Second, our country's financial institutions and industrial and commercial enterprises are concentrated in the coastal provinces. Since Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou were successively abandoned, the government authorities have failed to directly and strictly control the financial institutions and floating capital there. Third, the rear is short of funds, resources have not yet been developed, and financial institutions have not yet been widely established. Although the government authorities have tried to remedy this by setting up branches of the National Bank and expanding the organization of the financial network, and encouraging the Shanghai Commercial Bank to add branches, the number of banks in the rear has increased sharply, but it is still difficult to achieve significant results in the short term in regulating the finance of the rear and developing the industry of the rear.</p>
<p>Our country's wartime finance is in such an environment, and naturally, it suffers from various pathological conditions. First, let's discuss the issue of floating capital. If social floating capital is not used for proper purposes, it will flood the market and cause great harm. Shanghai is in a situation of temporary peace, and the population has increased sharply, and funds have also concentrated accordingly. Since the European War, the flooding of floating capital in Shanghai has become even more prominent. The funds that escaped in the past have returned one after another, and funds from the Nanyang area have also flowed to Shanghai in large numbers. According to the Shanghai Bank's business report for the 28th year, from the outbreak of the European War to the end of last year, the funds flowing into Shanghai from Hong Kong alone reached a huge amount of 150 million yuan. From this, it can be seen that the number of funds coming to Shanghai is quite considerable. Furthermore, observing the business reports of various banks, time deposits have decreased while demand deposits have increased sharply. It can also be seen that the issue of floating capital in Shanghai has reached a serious stage. The abundance of floating capital is not a blessing for Shanghai's finance.</p>
<p>Now that Shanghai's floating capital has increased sharply, let's look at Shanghai's need for funds. The prosperous industrial and commercial area of ​​the Southeast has been devastated by the war, and only a corner of the concession remains. The investment of large enterprises in the past has suffered greatly. The industries that have fallen into enemy hands have all been controlled by the Japanese puppets. Therefore, the use of funds has been shrinking day by day. Even in the Shanghai concession, capitalists dare not invest in large enterprises to build large-scale factories because, in the current situation of temporary peace, future changes are still difficult to predict. Therefore, the industries that have been built after the war are all small-scale.</p>
<p>Shanghai's need for funds is less than before the war, but the concentration of funds is greater than before the war. Since funds have no normal channels to accommodate them, they flood the market and flow into speculation. Initially, the target of speculation was still foreign exchange and margin trading, which had already damaged the country's strength, but did not threaten the people's livelihood. Since the European War, the target of speculation has been extended to foreign stocks and goods. As for the hoarding of goods, it was initially limited to metals, cotton yarn, and medicines, etc., and later extended to general daily necessities of the people, such as rice, flour, and coal, etc. The price doubled in just a few days, and the impact on the people's livelihood can be imagined. Although speculators suffered a serious blow in mid-May, with considerable losses, speculation flourished again within a few months, and the hoarding of goods was even more rampant than before. This is really due to the lack of good outlets for floating capital.</p>
<p>In short, the abundance of floating capital and speculative hoarding not only harms the development of the national economy and increases the threat to the people's livelihood, but also affects the future of the war. Therefore, the pathological state of our country's wartime finance should be adjusted as soon as possible. I hope that the government authorities will continue to work hard. I will not hesitate to present a few points that should be reformed below, and I hope that knowledgeable people in the country will not hesitate to correct them.</p>
<p>To rationalize our country's wartime finance, nothing is better than first strengthening the organization of banks. At present, there are only a little over ten banks in our country that have strong capital and excellent credit. The rest of the banks have small capital and weak activity; or due to poor management, their credit is poor. Such banks are naturally unable to shoulder the heavy burden of wartime finance. Moreover, the deposits of banks are increasing rapidly in large banks, and there is still a phenomenon of outflow in small banks from time to time. The deposits of small banks are obtained by high interest rates. If they are now confused by speculation to gamble for a temporary fortune, why would they be willing to transfer capital to the rear? Speculation is a risky business, and if it unfortunately fails, it is bound to lead to bankruptcy. The development of the banking industry was originally intended to promote financial stability and national economic prosperity. Now, the proliferation of small banks is a deformed development, which instead disrupts finance and promotes the decline of the national economy. Therefore, bank mergers are an important task for our country's wartime finance. The benefits of mergers are as follows: First, after bank mergers, they will not be as scattered as they are now, and government management will naturally be easier. From this, the attitude of banks that have always been outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient can be eliminated. Second, after bank mergers, the scale will be large and the credit will be strong, which can shoulder the heavy responsibility of wartime finance. Third, after bank mergers, the financial resources will be strong, which can help the authorities combat speculation and transfer capital to the rear. However, I believe that bank mergers do not mean merging all the banks in the country into one or two large banks to manipulate the country's finance, but merging those with similar nature to improve the organization of banks.</p>
<h3>Increase Deposit Interest Rates to Absorb Social</h3>
<p>— Floating Capital</p>
<p>The deposit interest rates of our country's banks are already too high, with demand deposits above 4% and time deposits above 7%. In peacetime, the burden of banks is already too heavy. Moreover, at a time when deposits are increasing sharply and loans are decreasing, banks are in a state of distress for the use of deposits. Therefore, in order to reduce their own burden, there have recently been moves to reduce interest rates. From the perspective of the banks themselves, this seems to be reasonable, but from the perspective of the national economy, it is harmful and not beneficial. After the interest rate reduction, the impact on the psychology of depositors is quite large, which is enough to prompt depositors to urgently seek the use of funds and return the deposits in the bank to the market for speculative activities. Therefore, at the present time, it is unwise for banks to implement interest rate reductions, and it violates the measures for national financial stability. Compared with the high profits of speculation and deposit interest rates, even such high interest rates cannot help but feel small. Depositors are confused by speculation, so they have changed time deposits to demand deposits, and increased the liquidity of demand deposits. The business reports of various banks show that time deposits have decreased and demand deposits have increased, which is clear evidence. From this, it can be seen that although the deposit interest rates of our country's banks are high, they no longer have the ability to absorb social floating capital. At present, to stabilize floating capital, the only way is to increase deposit interest rates, so that demand deposits can weaken their circulation rate, and even a part of unnecessary demand deposits can be induced by high interest rates and return to time deposits. At present, foreign exchange is trending down, margin trading is falling, and commodity prices are stabilizing. General small speculators have felt that there is no profit to be made. This city is a good time to increase deposit interest rates to stabilize floating capital. If floating capital tends to stabilize, the speculation in the market can be greatly reduced. Recently, the newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance issued an order to increase the interest rates of simple savings and national construction savings of the Four Banks. If it can be promoted nationwide, it will be the prelude to solving the problem of floating capital.</p>
<p>Managing Bank Funds</p>
<p>Our country's banks have developed abnormally under speculation. Before the legal currency system, the operating basis of banks was public bonds, margin trading, and real estate. Therefore, in the 23rd and 24th years, when the financial crisis broke out, it was almost impossible to recover. After the implementation of the legal currency system, although the business of banks has improved, such as lending to industry and commerce, expanding agricultural loans, and investing in transportation projects, the main use of bank funds is still inseparable from speculation. For example, the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange crisis and the soaring prices of public bonds on the eve of the war. Since the war moved west and Shanghai recovered its prosperity, banks have paid more attention to speculation. The operation of dark exchange, near-term and far-term arbitrage, the trading of margin trading, and the hoarding of goods are more profitable than any investment. By this spring, speculation in foreign stocks and foreign securities has also reached unprecedented levels. But the good times did not last long. The reaction in mid-May this year gave the banking industry a serious lesson. Under the complicated international situation at present, speculation cannot proceed as smoothly as in the past, but banks are still suffering from the lack of good outlets for funds and cannot break away from speculation. Although our country has had banks for decades and their development is very rapid, they have contributed very little to the improvement of the national economy. This is because our government has not strictly supervised and guided the use of bank funds, which has led to the development of banks on the wrong track and sometimes harmed the development of the national economy. This point should be corrected as soon as possible, which is not only conducive to the stability of wartime finance, but also has great assistance to the recovery of the economy after the war. The Ministry of Finance issued ten articles of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks in Extraordinary Times" on August 7 this year, which stipulated that the deposit reserve of each bank must be deposited in the National Bank, and strictly prohibited the bank's own speculative and hoarding activities, and restricted mortgage lending, etc. The purpose is to manage the use of bank funds and have the effect of curbing speculation. If these measures can be effectively implemented, they will have a great effect on combating speculation and hoarding. Although Shanghai is an area beyond the reach of the law, the banking industry should also shoulder the responsibility of stabilizing finance, and can adopt the method of automatic restriction, stop self-operated speculation, and reduce dealings with those who speculate and hoard. Promoting speculation and hoarding is not a good outlet for bank funds. Now, for the sake of national interests and the interests of the banks themselves, we should stop self-operated speculation and cut off the supply to speculators as soon as possible. Although it will reduce profits at present, it can avoid a serious crisis in the future.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the goal of "using war to support war," the Japanese have adopted various means of exploitation to squeeze the occupied areas. The categories of its means can be summarized into the following five categories:</p>
<p>1.  Monopoly: The Japanese have considerable experience in monopoly. Its implementation in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan has achieved considerable results. Monopoly is actually a kind of indirect taxation, embedding taxation in the selling price of goods. Its implementation in its own country is a good system for financial revenue and the national economy, but its implementation in the invaded area can invisibly exploit the people of that area as much as possible. Those who are exploited often do not know who is exploiting them. For example, the rice on the Beijing-Hangzhou lines must be purchased by Japanese foreign firms, and then resold to rice merchants by Japanese foreign firms. However, after the rice has passed through the transitional turnover of Japanese foreign firms, the original selling price has increased by more than double. The ruthlessness of the squeezing is chilling. The so-called Japanese foreign firms are certainly not ordinary commercial firms, but political institutions.</p>
<p>2.  Control: The silk cocoons of Zhejiang and Anhui, the mint of Haimen, Jiangsu, etc., all those that can be exchanged for foreign exchange are controlled and exported by them. We must deliberately make things difficult and not allow them to be shipped.</p>
<p>3.  Heavy taxes: Taking advantage of unscrupulous merchants to contract taxes, no item is exempt from taxes on consumption needs, and the amount of taxes is either heavy or stacked.</p>
<p>4.  Military tickets: Exchanging legal currency with worthless military tickets and joint banknotes, or directly using military tickets to purchase local goods in the occupied areas and requisitioning labor.</p>
<p>5.  Others: Occupying production industries and public utilities to control the consumption of people in the occupied areas and engage in exploitation.</p>
<p>After reading the above, we can get a general understanding of the Japanese exploitation in the occupied areas, and we can also know that the Japanese have used point-line forces to extend to the inner layers and want to dominate the entire occupied area economy. Therefore, the point-line problem does not allow us to cling to the old idea of ​​"not worth mentioning." We should confirm its seriousness and jointly devise countermeasures.</p>
<p>Proper Outlet for Floating Capital</p>
<p>If bank funds can be managed and the trend of speculation can be greatly curbed; after deposit interest rates are increased, floating capital can also be gradually stabilized. If funds still lack a good outlet, wouldn't it be just adding to the burden of banks, and bank funds will flow back into speculation to maintain their own interests. The effect of bank management will certainly not last long. Shanghai feels that there is an excess of floating capital because Shanghai's funds lack an outlet, so it must be moved to the rear to develop the vast west. So that it can cooperate with construction work. Although the call for the transfer of capital to the interior is high, the amount of capital transferred to the interior is still small. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: First, more than 70% of bank deposits are demand deposits. If the bank implements the transfer to the interior, depositors will panic, which will cause a run on deposits. Second, Shanghai is a den of speculation, who would be willing to abandon it and enter the rear? Third, the economy of the rear has not yet developed, and industries have not yet been built, so there are very few investment targets. Fourth, after the funds flow into the rear, they are subject to domestic remittance restrictions. If they want to flow out again, it will be quite troublesome, so floating capital is also unwilling to move inland rashly. If the difficulties mentioned in the first and second items above can be properly managed, small problems can be solved. But if the other difficulties are not removed, our country's floating capital problem will certainly not be solved. Before implementing the transfer of floating capital to the interior, there are four prerequisite problems that should be solved first. First, the government authorities should guide the outlet of the capital transferred to the interior. Second, the resources of the rear are still to be developed. Using the transferred capital to open up wasteland, the success or failure of the project is difficult to predict. Therefore, the floating capital that is content with speculation in Shanghai will not be willing to do this difficult work, so the government authorities must use interest guarantee methods to encourage it. Third, the capital transferred to the interior is not subject to domestic remittance restrictions, so that its flow is free. Fourth, the application for the purchase of foreign exchange for the transferred capital should be relaxed, and if it is appropriate, the China and Transportation Banks should supply it as much as possible according to the merchant exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Economic Extraction and Feudal Economy</h3>
<p>— Zhou Meiyi</p>
<p>More than a year has passed since the Battle of Wuhan. During this period, except for the battles of Changsha and Nanchang, no large-scale fierce war has occurred. Both China and Japan have mostly engaged in economic contention. In the form of economic contention, Japan often takes the initiative, while China is in a passive position. The most obvious ones are the prohibition of traffic between Yunnan and Vietnam, the suspension of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, and the past embargo between Yunnan and Myanmar. In addition, there are also the bombing of industrial and commercial areas by Japanese aircraft. The former's embargo and suspension of navigation are intended to cut off the supply of materials to the rear, and the latter's bombing is intended to destroy the rear's productive forces, so as to make our economy fall into poverty and collapse, and the war effort is unable to continue. In the occupied areas, the policy of "using war to support war" is implemented, and our people and materials are exploited as much as possible for use, or transported for export in exchange for foreign exchange. The foreign exchange is used to purchase military supplies from overseas, or directly transported to Japan to supply shortages. All similar to the above are the Japanese's vicious economic tactics.</p>
<p>"Feudal economy" can be adopted as a countermeasure against "using war to support war." The so-called feudal economy is a product brought about by past political separatism. In the past, warlords and other feudal lords often used it to cultivate wealth and consolidate their territories. For example, the self-issued banknotes in Shanxi and Guangdong, the control of local products leaving the province, the interception of donations, and the development of production industries are all aimed at self-sufficiency, so that the economic relationship between the province and the central government is broken. In this way, the economy within his feudal territory can be free from external control. This kind of means is naturally extremely harmful to a government that truly represents the people. On the one hand, it affects its financial revenue, and on the other hand, it aggravates the difficulties in the unification work, hindering political progress. But today, it is implemented in the occupied areas to combat the vicious plan of "using war to support war" and to fight against the exploitation of the people by the monsters. It is the supreme strategy.</p>
<p>In many places in the occupied areas, the economic struggle is obviously not strong enough. Most of them only focus on objective blockades such as prohibiting imports and exports and the circulation of military banknotes, and have not established subjective self-sufficiency, and have not organized the economy. Because of this main defect, the blockade is easily broken through by the Japanese's large-scale use of unscrupulous merchants to smuggle in and out, and in fact, it has not broken away from the urban economy (the city is the point of the point-line) and cannot get rid of being exploited by it. From now on, the occupied areas should strengthen feudalization to the cities, and establish many feudal economic units in the occupied areas. In each unit, investigate the population, estimate the consumption of daily necessities, promote handicrafts, improve local methods, develop production, and plant all kinds of needed crops extensively, not specializing in the planting of a certain crop. (For example, Tonghai and other places produce a large amount of cotton and mint.) Promote self-sufficiency, and then combine it with an objective embargo, then you can achieve the effect of sealing off the city, and at the same time stabilize the lives of the people in the occupied areas. The scope of the organized unit should be as small as possible, and cultivate the habit of the people to organize their own units, because after the Japanese discover this kind of group that economically conflicts with them, they will destroy it with military laws. The small scope of the unit means that those who are destroyed are only limited to a small range and have nothing to do with other units and are not affected. Moreover, the Japanese have limited manpower. The occupied villages are often abandoned soon after they are occupied. After they leave, the people in the unit, based on the organizational habits they have developed in the past, and because this kind of group activity can stabilize their lives and eliminate the exploitation by the Japanese, will be happy to quickly resume their activities for the sake of their own interests.</p>
<p>If we can do the above steps, we will not only have strangled the throat of "using war to support war," but also because the people's lives are stable, we can also reduce many people who are forced by clothing and food to become Japanese puppets.</p>
<h3>Opening a Silver Firm or Bank</h3>
<p>— Wu Mengdie</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Qu Dongsheng</p>
<p>Regarding the seven questions you asked, here are my detailed answers:</p>
<p>(1) "Futures" is the opposite of "spot," and "nearby term" is the opposite of "distant term." Any transaction to be settled within the current month is called "nearby term"; a transaction to be settled next month or in several months is called "distant term"; and a transaction that can be settled on the same day is called "spot." A "short" is a customer who sells first and then buys to cover, because they have a "short position." A "long" is a customer who buys first and then prepares to sell. "Selling" and "buying" are self-explanatory, so there is no need to explain them.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary silver firms do not have fixed standards for trading margins. Please refer to the previous issue's article on the gold market for information on ×× Firm and its relationship with the Joint Exchange Association.</p>
<p>(3) Whether opening a silver firm as a partnership or a limited liability company, the procedures are the same as opening a general business. However, the operation of such a firm is subject to the restrictions of the Banking Law, but the Banking Law has not yet been fully implemented.</p>
<p>(4) ×× Foreign Firm, etc., are brokers who trade on behalf of customers. They are formal businesses. It's like a rice shop being a formal store, but a rice shop manipulating rice prices is like a rice weevil.</p>
<p>(5) According to the Banking Law, both banks and silver firms fall under Article 1 of the Banking Law: "Anyone engaged in one of the following businesses is a bank: 1. Accepting deposits and making loans; 2. Discounting bills; 3. Remittance or documentary credit. Anyone engaged in one of the preceding businesses without being a bank is regarded as a bank." However, the reason why there are so many silver firms in Shanghai is that silver firms are, in name, financial institutions outside of banks and native banks, and thus can operate without restrictions. Remittance business is a banking business. Whether trading on behalf of customers is legal depends on the circumstances. If one trades cotton yarn on behalf of customers, it is naturally illegal. The recently enacted "Special Period Management of Banking Law" has explicitly prohibited this.</p>
<p>(6) The Central Bank is a national bank, and its exchange rate postings are formal. Before the war, the exchange rate postings of HSBC were based on the Central Bank's postings, just like the postings of small native banks on Sichuan Road, which copied HSBC's postings. After the war, due to China's management of foreign exchange, the Central Bank's postings became nominal prices, while HSBC's postings reflected the actual black market trading prices. Because HSBC is a commercial bank with semi-official British status, black market foreign exchange trading is concentrated there.</p>
<p>(7) Banks do not have special storage for customers' purchases of public bonds. There are currently no futures for public bonds in the black market. As for whether the prices of futures and spot goods are high or low, it depends on the financial situation and commodity circulation situation of the current month and the next month.</p>
<h3>Electricity Bill Calculation Method</h3>
<p>— Huang Yunjian</p>
<p>Since the recent increase in electricity rates, general users, not understanding the calculation methods, have often overlooked the electricity cost component in the cost of ordinary manufactured goods, resulting in inaccurate calculations. Therefore, I will explain my calculation method below.</p>
<p>For example, if 63 kilowatt-hours of electricity are used for lighting, costing 7 taels, 5 mace, and 6 fen of silver, with a surcharge of 180.97%, the cost per kilowatt-hour is 3 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, 1 si, 6 hu, 4 xu, 0 yi of silver. Using a tariff of 0.715, the cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour is 4 jiao, 7 fen, 1 li, 5 hao, 5 si, 6 hu in national currency.</p>
<p>The cost of electricity for ordinary power users is much lower than that for lighting. Each kilowatt-hour costs only 4 fen and 5 li of silver, which is 3 fen and 2 li, 9 hao in national currency. Now, with a surcharge rate of 355.87%, the cost has increased considerably compared to before. However, the cost per kilowatt-hour is still only 1 qian and 5 li, 1 hao, 4 si, 1 hu, which is 1 jiao, 8 fen, 6 li, 9 hao in national currency. For example, if 1488 kilowatt-hours of ordinary power are used, costing 66 taels, 9 mace, and 6 fen of silver, with a surcharge of 355.87%, the cost per kilowatt-hour is 1 qian and 5 li, 1 hao, 4 si, 1 hu of silver. Using a tariff of 0.715, the cost of ordinary power per kilowatt-hour should be 2 jiao, 8 fen, 6 li, 9 hao.</p>

<h3>Financial Review</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>—November 9th— Economic Construction in Sichuan and Kangding</p>
<p>After entering the second stage of the Sino-Japanese War, it has shifted from a military war to an economic war. Currently, the provinces of Sichuan and Kangding in China are important bases for resisting Japan and building the nation. To strengthen the power of economic warfare, we must actively and effectively promote the various facilities and organization of agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, transportation, and finance in these two provinces. Therefore, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Sichuan-Kangding Economic Construction Committee was formally established in Chengdu on November 2nd. The committee brings together the power of the government and the people, concentrates the leaders of the Party, government, military, and civilians in Sichuan and Kangding, as well as prominent scholars from within and outside the provinces. On the day of its establishment, it convened its first general meeting, which lasted for three days. The meeting passed more than seventy motions. Following the draft outline of the Sichuan-Kangding Economic Construction Plan proposed by Chairman Chiang, the draft three-year Sichuan Economic Construction Plan of the Sichuan Provincial Production Planning Committee, and the Outline of Kangding Economic Construction proposed by the Kangding Provincial Government, the meeting formulated a complete and concrete Sichuan-Kangding Economic Construction Plan. At the same time, it was decided to expand funding and quickly establish the Sichuan-Kangding Industrial Development Company as an institution to practically promote economic construction. Sichuan Province has abundant resources and has long been known as the "Land of Abundance," which shows the great potential of its economy. After the war of resistance began, it became the rear center of China. To meet the needs of national defense and lay the foundation for people's livelihood, economic construction must naturally be coordinated with politics and military affairs, with Sichuan Province as the center. As for Kangding, which is adjacent to Sichuan, although it is a newly established province, it has many treasures. Except for the inconvenience in transportation, everything is suitable for economic construction. We should place the greatest hope on this new province and must not waste its resources.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, the central government has invested more than 30 million yuan in Sichuan to manage steel, fuel, public utilities, electricity, and power supply industries related to national defense. It has also assisted private enterprises such as the steel industry, chemical industry, paper industry, match industry, fuel industry, machinery industry, power industry, and textile industry, with a total investment of more than 30 million yuan. In terms of agricultural loans, the accurate total is more than 40 million yuan, accounting for one-third of the total agricultural loans in the country. As for the establishment of Kangding Province, the industrial construction has also made considerable progress in the past year. Woolen mills have been established in Kangding and Ya'an, using the cattle and sheep hides produced in Kangding and Ganzi. A larger leather factory has been specially established in Ya'an, using new methods to manufacture leather; a paper mill has been established using the white bamboo produced in Ya'an; and a wood dry distillation plant has been established somewhere on the eastern slope of Daxue Mountain, utilizing the rich forests. At the same time, a hydroelectric power plant has been established to meet the needs of Ya'an's industry, providing industrial power. These are only a part of the economic construction of Sichuan and Kangding. There are still many other businesses that can be developed and urgently need to be developed, requiring continued efforts in many aspects. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Flat White Iron Rises Again and Again</h3>
<p>The market condition of flat white iron has been very good recently. The reason is that the circulating goods in the market are extremely scarce, and those who want to buy are worried that there is no goods to buy. Moreover, merchants from the inland rivers often search for goods, and the transactions of construction workers and retail buyers in this street are also very lively, and the hoarders also hoarding for profit, so there is not enough spot goods to distribute for a time, so the industry peers who hold the goods are quite prosperous. The standard market price has risen again and again. Yesterday, the asking price for 7-foot iron has reached 9.5 yuan, and 6-foot iron is also sold for 8 yuan per sheet.</p>
<h3>Fennel Continues to Rise</h3>

<h3>Tomorrow is the Anniversary of the Premier's Birth: The Whole City Will Celebrate by Hanging National Flags; Emulate the Premier's Personality and Support National Policies; Donate Winter Clothing Funds and Actively Promote</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen. All sectors deeply admire the Premier's great achievements and devotion to the revolution, because it was the Premier's birth that led to the establishment of the Republic of China. At that time, flags will be hung to express celebration. Government agencies, public organizations, schools, and silver and money industries will also take a holiday as usual. The Bureau of Public Works and all its subordinate offices will also close for one day. In order to support national policies and complete the great cause of national construction, all sectors have decided to expand the promotion of frugal national construction savings, promote production and construction, and continue to donate funds for winter clothing to comfort the soldiers and rescue the refugees. The authorities of the two concessions believe that tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, and the day after tomorrow is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of Chinese troops to the west. In order to maintain security within the concessions, they will be on high alert from tomorrow onwards to strengthen defenses.</p>
<p>Holiday Celebrations for Chinese and Foreign Institutions</p>
<p>The embassies and consulates of the Central, American, French, German, Italian, and other countries in this city, as well as the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession, will all be closed for one day to celebrate the Premier's birthday. A notice has been issued to all foreign residents of these countries. Except for temporary emergencies, all official business will resume on the 13th. The courts, customs, post offices, and other institutions and groups, schools at all levels, factories, banks, and money shops in this city will also follow the central government's regulations and close for one day, in addition to hanging flags according to the law, in order to celebrate.</p>
<p>Strict Precautions and Strict Enforcement of Curfew</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions have, in addition to explicitly prohibiting gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities since the 7th, and strictly enforcing curfew laws, also started to tighten security from yesterday onwards to prevent illegal activities by bad elements. The authorities of the Public Concession have also increased posts in the west and north districts, and dispatched more patrol and search teams to check passing vehicles and pedestrians, and dispatched police cars to patrol in separate districts. On the French Concession side, from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm, armed patrol teams composed of French, Chinese, and Vietnamese police officers patrolled the roads. If they encountered suspicious pedestrians or vehicles, they were stopped and checked. As for road traffic, it is said that there are no plans to close it.</p>
<p>Active Promotion of Winter Clothing Donations</p>
<p>The Lide Fellowship Society issued a notice to all its members yesterday, because tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, urging them to emulate the Father of the Nation's spirit of struggle and make further efforts to promote the movement of national construction savings, donations, and winter clothing donations in all sectors. Based on the experience of the National Day fundraising, the society notified all members to pay attention to two points: (1) According to the statistics of the previous resolution, most of the savings, donations, and winter clothing donations come from salaried classes. It is believed that the patriotism of the wealthy classes and large enterprises in Shanghai is not behind others. All members should strive to promote in this direction in order to achieve great results. (2) A few members are unable to actively promote due to fear of interference from the concession authorities, but they must know that the fundraising work will not affect the security of the concession. Everyone has a motherland, and the concession authorities love their countries as well. As civilized human beings, they will never suppress the minimum patriotic actions of the citizens. Do not be timid and discouraged, and neglect to promote it.</p>

<h3>Good News from Chinese Troops in Wujiang County</h3>
<p>According to a person from Wujiang County, at the end of last month, the troops of the Chinese guerrilla team led by Chen Yaozong, who were moving in the vicinity of Shangta and Xinta, were suddenly attacked by a large number of Japanese troops and miscellaneous troops totaling more than 200 people. The Chinese side was prepared and immediately attacked from the east and west, surrounding the enemy on all sides, and using light and heavy machine guns to sweep the Japanese troops in close formation. After five or six hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops had no target and could not land, suffering heavy casualties and retreating in defeat. Unexpectedly, the next morning, a large number of Japanese troops arrived from the direction of Qingpu Jiaoli, intending to retaliate. So the two sides fought fiercely again. From about 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, the Japanese troops were finally defeated by the Chinese troops' irresistible force, and retreated due to the approaching dusk. According to nearby villagers, the two sides fought for as long as ten hours in this battle. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and had their weapons damaged. A speedboat was sunk by the Chinese troops with small mortars. As for the Chinese side, due to proper concealment and the protection of dozens of machine gun emplacements, the casualties were very slight.</p>

<p>Since the National Frugal National Construction Savings Movement Committee stipulated that the period from November 10th to 16th should be the National Expanded Frugal Savings Movement Promotion Week, various groups in Shanghai have been ordered to comply. However, due to the special situation of the Shanghai concession area, no public ceremonies will be held, and efforts will be made to participate in the Frugal National Construction Savings Movement, purchase savings bonds, or open accounts at the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the National Agricultural Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to save money, and universally advise relatives and friends to actively save, in order to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the purpose of frugal national construction. Frugal savings is the only way to absorb idle funds, increase production, balance prices, and stabilize society.</p>
<p>(Savings) Frugal National Construction Savings are accepted by government officials, businesses, banks, and postal remittance bureaus throughout the country, and the safety of principal and interest is guaranteed by the government. National currency of one yuan or more can be used to open an account, and depositors can deposit money at any time. The principal and interest can only be withdrawn after five years. Banks that accept National Construction Savings must apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval in advance and be given a higher interest rate than ordinary savings. The accounting is completely independent and is not mixed with the profits and losses of the business. The use of savings is limited to land reclamation, water conservancy construction, national defense production, mining development, and investment in economic construction projects.</p>
<p>(Bonds) The Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of Communications, the National Commercial Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, issue Frugal National Construction Savings Bonds, which are divided into two types, A and B. Type A is purchased by saving according to the face value, and interest and dividends are given when the bonds are redeemed upon maturity. Type B is redeemed at face value after maturity with interest estimated at the time of purchase. Type A earns 6% weekly interest after six months, 7% weekly interest after one year, 7.5% weekly interest from the second year, and compound interest every six months, with dividends added at the end of the fifth year. Type B estimates interest at 7% weekly interest for one year, 7.5% weekly interest for two years, 8% weekly interest for three to five years, and 8.5% weekly interest for more than five years.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Chamber of Commerce and Silver and Money Industries: Strictly Absorb Deposits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industries Association, following the instruction No. 17922 from the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, strictly prohibit general commercial firms from concurrently engaging in absorbing deposits or handling remittances. It has recently notified member associations and banks and money shops to comply with and handle matters in accordance with the instructions, and to reward those who report violations and strictly investigate and deal with them.</p>
<h3>Vacancies for Foreign Police Officers in the Police Department: Promotion of Chinese Officers Recommended by the Economic Committee</h3>
<p>The Special Economic Committee of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession has recently completed its review of the economic situation of various departments of the Public Works Bureau. Regarding the police department, the committee believes that it is difficult to restrain or reform the police department under the current situation, because the number of cases in the concession is accumulating, and personnel and expenses cannot be reduced.</p>
<p>Promotion of Chinese Officers to Fill Vacancies for Foreign Police Officers</p>
<p>It is learned that the committee has made the following recommendations to the police department: The vacancies for foreign police officers in the first and second sections and the Indian police section should be filled as soon as possible to reach the budgeted number of people. The vacancies for foreign police officers should be filled by promoting senior Chinese officers (those with higher ranks of "Deputy Inspector"). The Indian police section should be supplemented by promoting or recruiting junior officers (constables and sergeants). The salaries and allowances should all be paid in local currency.</p>
<p>Akaki Report: Committee's Opinion</p>
<p>When the committee was conducting the investigation of the police department, Akira Akaki, the Japanese special police chief, submitted a report on the second section of the foreign police department and proposed a reorganization plan. However, the committee has not yet expressed any opinion on Akaki's report, but believes that any police officer, regardless of nationality, should be able to be promoted to the highest position if they can prove their competence. As far as Japanese police officers are concerned, when the new "E district" planned by the police department is established, experienced police officers will also have the opportunity to be promoted.</p>
<h3>Accounts of the Poor Children's Relief Center to be Submitted to the Competent Authority</h3>
<p>The accounts of the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center in this city, after being investigated by the chairman of the board, Shou Yong, the supervisors Wu Yunzhai and Dai Chunfeng, and the director Sun Choucheng, have been compiled and submitted to the competent authority for verification by the board of directors, which includes the usual income and expenses, the broadcast income and expenses, and the audited accounts of the accountant. Therefore, the truth will be revealed to the public soon.</p>
<h3>As the European Bloody War is in Full Swing, Peace Prayers are Offered Today; Flowers are Offered Before the Goddess of Peace; British Residents Offer the Cost of Buying Flowers to the Motherland</h3>
<p>Twenty-three years ago today was the day the European War ceased. The words of the Treaty of Versailles are still in existence, but unexpectedly a second war has broken out. When commemorating the peace of today, and recalling the future evolution of the situation, there are two kinds of feelings. The British, American, and French people here will offer flowers before the goddess of peace this morning to express their sorrow.</p>
<p>The Money for Buying Flowers is Used as War Funds</p>
<p>In previous years, the British residents in Shanghai, under the leadership of the British Victory Association, held a grand flower offering ceremony. The wreaths were even brought from London. In addition to everyone wearing white flowers on their lapels, they were publicly exhibited at the British Victory Association Hall. A thousand British residents visited, and the money from the sale of all the wreaths was remitted to the motherland to be used for the families of the disabled soldiers in the war during the war, and part of it was designated for use in Shanghai. Therefore, the value of each flower or wreath was considerable. However, this year, the funds for offering wreaths will be used to support the national war fund.</p>
<p>British Residents Hold Flower Offering Ceremony</p>
<p>Usually on this day of commemorating peace, in addition to the British residents, the commander of the British troops stationed here presides over the flower offering ceremony. This year's situation is different from previous years. The British troops have withdrawn, and the British Victory Association and the British Legion will be in charge of everything. The pastor will hold a prayer at 8:30 am this morning before the goddess of peace at the corner of Edward Road. However, the time will be short and the ceremony will be simple. All private dinners, dances, and all-night gatherings will not be held this year. Only a peace prayer was held at the American church yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Celebration Banquet for the US Marine Corps</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the US Fourth Marine Corps, a musical program and hymns are usually held at the Grand Theater. However, yesterday at 9:00 am, in commemoration of the first European war peace, the pastor of the corps presided over the event. Yesterday was also the 165th anniversary of the establishment of the US Marine Corps. At 8:00 pm last night, US Marine Corps Commander Baker, US Consul General Lockhead, US China Assessor Justice Hailmilk, US Yangtze Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, and senior officers of the Fourth Marine Corps held a banquet at the consulate on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road to celebrate. The leaders of the American community in this port, the senior officials of the Public Works Bureau, and the senior officers of the International Volunteer Corps were all invited.</p>
<p>US Military Pastor Prays for Peace</p>
<p>The US naval authorities in Shanghai cannot fail to express their views on the annual commemoration of the end of the European War. Therefore, it was also decided that at 11:00 am today, Colonel Baker of the Fourth Marine Corps would lead all officers to make a similar flower offering ceremony before the god of peace. The accompanying pastor will pray for peace. Today is the commemoration of the European War Peace, and tomorrow is the Premier's birthday. The US Consulate will be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>French Tramway and Bus Fares to Increase Regularly, Effective the 13th, Increase of One Cent Per Stop</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumored increase in fares for French tramways, which was said to take effect yesterday (the 10th), tram fares on all lines in the French Concession remained unchanged from previously set prices. According to inquiries by a Pingming News Agency reporter, the French Water and Electricity Company, after being approved by the French Municipal Council to increase various water and electricity fees, implemented the increase on the 6th of this month. However, the tramway portion required further assessment, so the fare increase could not be implemented simultaneously. It is now heard that the tramway fare increase will take effect the day after tomorrow (the 13th), with an increase of 25% to 50% per mile, or one cent per stop. The French bus lines will also increase fares at the same time.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Continues to Accept British Banknotes</h3>
<p>Since the British government ordered a ban on the circulation of Bank of England banknotes outside the UK, the Chinese Ministry of Finance, to protect the interests of Chinese citizens holding these banknotes, designated Bank of China branches as the agency for collecting and exchanging these banknotes for remittance to the UK. This was originally scheduled to end on August 28th. Now, due to transportation difficulties for those in the interior holding these banknotes, who were unable to exchange them within the deadline, the Ministry of Finance has, after consultation with the British authorities, ordered the Bank of China to continue accepting these banknotes to avoid losses for Chinese holders. The Bank of China head office has already notified all branches to comply.</p>
<h3>Second US Evacuation Ship to Leave Shanghai Tonight, Expected to Arrive Here at 11 AM Today, Destination After Korea Unknown</h3>
<p>The second US evacuation ship, the "Mariposa," was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th. According to an announcement by the American President Lines, the ship's telegram stated that it would be delayed until 11 AM today, docking at buoys 11 and 12. The ship will depart Shanghai at midnight due to the tight schedule, via Qinhuangdao, Chemulpo, Kobe, and Honolulu. American nationals from various parts of North China will board the ship in Qinhuangdao and Chemulpo. The "Mariposa" is scheduled to depart from Qinhuangdao on the 13th of this month. American nationals there have already booked 100 first-class tickets and 125 second- and third-class tickets. American President Lines officials could not yet comment on how many American nationals would be evacuated from Korea or what the ship's actions would be after leaving Busan.</p>
<p>Already Evacuated Women and Children Total Over a Thousand</p>
<p>It is estimated that over 700 American nationals have been evacuated from Shanghai so far, including 328 on the first evacuation ship, 94 on the Changxing Company's "Asia Queen," 190 on the American President Lines' "Coolidge," and 90 on the "President Pierce." Combined with the 85 scheduled to be evacuated on the second special ship "Mariposa" and the 600 on the third special ship "Washington," the total number is 1,387. In addition, those who left Shanghai on Japanese ships are not included in this number. It is heard that many American nationals are unwilling to evacuate on the special ships dispatched by the State Department, partly because it takes too much time and partly because the fares are too high.</p>
<p>Three More Ships to Arrive This Month</p>
<p>As for the third evacuation ship, the "Washington," it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th and depart on the 21st. It is heard that there are still many vacant cabins. In addition, ships on regular routes can also be used to evacuate American nationals. This month, the American President Lines' "Taft" is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st, and the Changxing Company's "Asia Queen" is scheduled to depart on the 1st of next month.</p>
<p>Far East Situation Cloudy, But No Rain Yet</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt's victory in the election, the isolationist and appeasement policies at home have been suppressed, and a stronger policy is about to be adopted in the Far East and Europe to oppose aggression and protect American interests. However, when this will be put into action is not yet clear. A reporter met with an observer yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to his observation, it will be after the United States completes the evacuation of women and children from the Far East. Considering that the second evacuation ship will leave Shanghai on the 21st and go to San Francisco via Manila, the timeframe is not far off. There may be new developments next month. Recently, the Far East appears calm on the surface, but judging from the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning and troop movements, its ambition to advance south has not been quelled. The United States is also watching intently and actively preparing, as if waiting for Japan to start a conflict. The fact that the evacuation of American nationals in the Far East is limited to women and children who have no need to stay in Shanghai shows that the United States is determined to protect its interests in the Far East and will not easily give up unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>Former Central Bank Site Sold to Foreign Merchants, Occupation Plan Likely to Encounter Difficulties, Building Has Important Historical Significance</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Central Bank building at the corner of Jiujiang Road and the Bund was taken over yesterday (the 9th) in the presence of officers from the Public Concession Police and the Japanese Military Police. The ultimate purpose of this move is still unknown.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Notified of Decision to Take Over</p>
<p>However, according to reliable sources, the building will be used to open a "Central Bank." Before the takeover, the Japanese Military Police notified the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council of their intention to take over the property. Just after 9 AM, officers from the Central Police Station were dispatched to the building to open it and inspect it before leaving near noon. The building had been vacant for some time, and there was no one in charge, only a few guards. In the afternoon, the building was taken over.</p>
<p>Observing the Situation, Repairs Seem Likely</p>
<p>The so-called important personnel have not yet entered the building, but there was activity in the left courtyard. Looking through the locked courtyard gate, many armed "political police" were seen, some in black uniforms and some in plain clothes, moving back and forth in the courtyard. The exact number is unknown. Several Public Concession police officers were stationed in front of the building, under orders not to allow idlers inside. Judging from the activity inside the building yesterday, it seems that repairs will be carried out first, and then personnel will move in. Yesterday morning, many laborers were engaged in cleaning.</p>
<p>Rumored That the Building Is Owned by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>The Central Bank of the Nationalist Government has long since withdrawn from the building, and a Municipal Council school was temporarily opened there. However, the school recently moved to Great Western Road, so the building is unoccupied. It is rumored that the Chongqing government has sold the building to foreign merchants. If this is true, the plan to use the building will likely encounter difficulties. The Central Bank building is the original site of the defunct Russo-Asiatic Bank and has important historical significance.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Once Visited</p>
<p>After the Nationalist Government obtained the property, it was used as the official Central Bank's office. High-ranking government officials visited the building, such as Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen, who is currently in the United States, both of whom served as Presidents of the Central Bank and had offices there. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also visited the building to personally see Kong Xiangxi off to England to attend the coronation of the British monarch. Therefore, the transfer of the building is of great importance to the Chinese side.</p>

Ding Shangui has been newly appointed as manager, and in addition to Zhu Kaiguan as deputy manager, Qian Jiazhen has also been appointed. The bank has reported this to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association for filing.</p>
<h3>Mediation of Tungho Bank Debt Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a third mediation session for the commercial department debt of Tungho Commercial Savings Bank at the Hong Kong Road Banking Association Club at 3 PM yesterday. Creditors representing 80% of the debt attended and approved the settlement plan proposed by the bank, which includes: (1) The directors and supervisors of the bank will be responsible for raising 20% of the cash, with 10% to be returned within one month after the settlement is established, and the remaining 10% to be returned by the end of the lunar year at the latest; (2) The remaining debt, including principal and interest of 300,000 national currency, is secured by the bank's mortgage rights to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which will be transferred to all creditors of the bank's commercial department, and five representatives elected by the creditors will be in charge of it, which will be used for full debt repayment. Dong Yu, Zhang Yiping, Xu Zuyan, Cheng Kefan, and Zhang Enhai were elected as representatives to sign the settlement terms and as custodians. The meeting adjourned satisfactorily at 4:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Detained Goods in Vietnam Protested</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou joint transportation of passengers and goods detained in Vietnam, after the Vietnamese governor canceled the order to return them to Shanghai and Hong Kong, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other departments for negotiations. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Chamber of Commerce yesterday that the Chamber of Commerce had received a telegram from the Chinese Consulate in Saigon stating, "When your Chamber of Commerce's telegram of October 30th was received, this consulate had already issued a protest." Also, the Saigon Cholon Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Shanghai, "This matter has been mediated."</p>

<h3>Central Anti-Epidemic Team Arrives in Ningbo, Intensifying Plague Prevention and Control, Active Disinfection and Quarantine Work, Telegram to Shanghai Appealing for Relief Funds for Ningbo Disaster</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Ningbo, the situation regarding plague prevention and control is as follows: (1) The Central Anti-Epidemic Team will arrive in Ningbo from Jinhua today to assist the Yin County Epidemic Prevention Office in carrying out plague eradication and prevention work. (2) The Yin County government has decided to inoculate households in the vicinity of the epidemic area. In addition, in the Class A quarantine hospital, eight more patients yesterday were in critical condition and their lives were in danger. Their symptoms were redness, headache, high fever, red spots all over the body, and even some vomiting blood. The Class B quarantine hospital had 26 patients and admitted ten new patients yesterday. (3) The epidemic prevention team searched and found twelve patients who had escaped from the epidemic area yesterday, all of whom were sent to the Class B quarantine hospital. A black dog infected with the plague was also found on Kaiming Street, shot dead, and buried by the burial team. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, in view of the serious plague in Ningbo, although prevention and control is appropriate and has not spread, the deaths of people in the epidemic area are successive, the situation is tragic, and medical treatment and burial expenses are high, has decided to convene a committee meeting in the coming days to discuss raising funds for disaster relief in Ningbo to benefit their hometown.</p>
<p>Telegram Appeal for Disaster Relief Funds</p>
<p>November 9th, telegram from Ningbo: Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in confidence, a plague has occurred in Ningbo, with successive deaths. The East Avenue area from No. 224 to No. 268 is now strictly sealed off. Residents in the area are moved to quarantine wards. Fortunately, the epidemic has not spread beyond the epidemic area in recent days. To eradicate it thoroughly, the houses and debris in the epidemic area must be burned, and the affected households should be provided with relief. Sir, you are enthusiastic about your hometown and plan to convey this to the fellow countrymen in Shanghai to jointly raise funds for disaster relief in Ningbo to reassure the victims. Sincerely, Xu Zhen, Yu Jimin, Zhou Dalie.</p>
<p>Strict Prevention and Control</p>
<p>November 10th, telegram from Ningbo: Yu Qiaqing and all fellow countrymen of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, in confidence, the plague-sealed area previously reported has been disinfected with a large amount of sulfur, and walls have been built around it. Residents outside the epidemic area have been inoculated on a household basis. The corpses of the infected are buried deep in remote areas, and ditches filled with ash are dug around the burial site to prevent toxic water from seeping into the river. The Central Anti-Epidemic Team will arrive in Ningbo tomorrow. As of today, a total of 61 people have died, and the three Class A, B, and C epidemic hospitals are currently accommodating a total of 165 patients. More to follow. Sincerely, Xu Zhen, Yu Jimin, Zhou Dalie.</p>
<h3>Mercenary Soldiers Near Suzhou Revolt</h3>
<p>According to people coming from Suzhou, since the Japanese army launched its autumn offensive, the Japanese army has been transferred out of the Jinghu area, and the defense is left to mercenary soldiers, and they are ordered to carry out so-called "sweeping" operations to strengthen their momentum. Therefore, recently, a large number of "troops" from Nanjing have been stationed in various towns near Suzhou, oppressing the people in every way. Two weeks ago, a large team of "Guards Brigade" from Nanjing was also stationed in Jiaozhi Town. However, these mercenary soldiers, in view of the fact that the</p>
<p>Guerrilla Commander Hu Zhaoyu in the area is deeply loved by the people, and the local market is more prosperous than the Japanese-occupied area, the people live and work in peace, and the cooperation between the army and the people is something they cannot do. Among the lower-level personnel of this team, there are also many who understand the general situation. Seeing this scene, they were greatly moved, and then sent representatives to contact Commander Hu to revolt, requesting to be given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. On the night of the next day,</p>
<p>they led their troops to surrender, bringing with them six machine guns, hundreds of Italian-made rifles, and countless ammunition. When the remnants heard the news, they fled in panic. They were ambushed by Commander Hu's troops, and many were killed or wounded. They fled towards Suzhou in a panic. In order to show their sincerity in participating in the work of national construction, the revolting troops requested Commander Hu to send troops to suppress the "Pacification Army" in Likou on the second day, and</p>
<p>were willing to act as scouts and guides. Commander Hu immediately approved the request and sent troops to surround and attack fiercely, and immediately defeated a large team, seizing countless guns and ammunition. Therefore, in recent days, the mercenary soldiers in the suburbs of Suzhou are all afraid of themselves and have fled to the urban area.</p>
<h3>Iron Nets Still Set Up at Alley Entrances on Yu Yuan Road, Public Buses Stopped as Before</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that the Municipal Council authorities, in view of the successive criminal cases that have occurred in the western district of the Public Concession in the past few days, added many barbed wire obstacles at the entrances of alleys along Yu Yuan Road and the border area of the Public Concession yesterday (the 9th) morning. Public buses traveling along Yu Yuan Road are still being blocked by the Japanese. Although there are rumors that all obstacles will be gradually removed, the situation in the western district of Shanghai yesterday remained the same. Regarding the re-establishment of barbed wire by the Japanese Military Police in the western Hongkou district, it is said that the Japanese authorities consider this a necessary measure because this measure is not within the scope of the recently concluded temporary agreement between the Japanese side and the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Two Native Place Associations Group Purchase Rice</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association in Shanghai believes that the rising rice prices in the city, although due to complex reasons, are mainly due to weak reserves. Therefore, it believes that group rice purchases can increase reserves and stop the rice prices from soaring. In view of this, the association has formulated regulations and entrusted the Tongrun Money Shop in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, to collect rice funds, with each household purchasing five bags of No. 2 Xian rice as the starting unit. More purchases are allowed, and fellow countrymen in Shanghai are encouraged to participate in this charitable cause. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, in order to expand the group rice purchase of fellow countrymen, issued a respectful notice to the fellow countrymen in Shanghai, stating the crux of the rising rice prices in Shanghai and the benefits of group rice purchase for the entire people's food.</p>
<h3>The Circumstances of the Shooting Death of General Zhu Qinglan's Eldest Son, Vietnamese Police Arbitrarily Opened Fire, Unreasonable to Describe, Zhu's Family Has Hired a French Lawyer, Filed a Public Prosecution with the French Concession Authorities</h3>
<p>Zhu Hua, a third-year architecture student at Soochow University in Shanghai, and his younger brother, Zhu Shu, are the sons of General Zhu Qinglan. Some time ago (the 5th), Zhu Hua's younger brother, Zhu Shu, went out to shop for a long time, and he did not return home, and Zhu Hua also went out to look for him. As he walked to Rue Ladu, he saw his younger brother quarreling with Vietnamese police and hooligans in front. At that time, another Vietnamese policeman passed by, and Zhu Hua asked him to mediate. This Vietnamese policeman did not ask about the truth, and shot him once, the bullet pierced through his abdomen, and he was sent to Guangci Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died on the morning of the 6th. Now Zhu's family has hired a French lawyer and filed a public prosecution with the French Concession authorities. A reporter from the Dachung News Agency drove to visit Zhu's family yesterday afternoon to inquire about the beginning and end of the accident. I would like to provide the following details:</p>
<p>The Accident Happened At about 7 PM on November 5th, the student Zhu Shu (with his brother Hua, who lived in Tao's house, No. 10 Remy Lane), went out to buy fruit after dinner. After buying it at the intersection of Rue Ladu and Rue Remy, he went to the fruit stand at the intersection of Avenue Auguste Savy and Rue Ladu to inquire about the price. At that time, a girl of fourteen or five years old walked past, and several people made indecent jokes with the girl, saying filthy words. Zhu Shu</p>
<p>Seeing the injustice of the road, he glared at these rascals. These people then turned to scolding Zhu Shu. Zhu Shu, feeling that he was being insulted for no reason, questioned them. These people were unreasonable, and they gathered around Zhu Shu to cause trouble. At this time, another rogue punched Zhu Shu in the back, and the punch happened to hit the hunting knife Zhu Shu was wearing on his waist. (This hunting knife was a souvenir from Zhu Shu's time in the Boy Scouts, it was not sharpened, had no blood grooves, and the road police were asked if it could be worn) He shouted to his companions, "This person is carrying a 'dagger'", so a dozen rascals gathered together to rob it. Zhu Shu was outnumbered, and the hunting knife was</p>
<p>stolen by the rascals, but Zhu Shu still held onto the sleeves of the two rascals and called for the police, and asked the Vietnamese police (A) to return the hunting knife. Zhu Shu then asked the Vietnamese police to take all the people to the police station. The Vietnamese police repeatedly said "Okay, okay". Zhu Shu's brother, Zhu Hua (23 years old, studied in the Architecture Department of Soochow University for three years, with a pure and peaceful personality, always ranked excellent in every exam), was at home and missed his younger brother Zhu Shu, who had been out shopping for a long time and had not returned. He went out to look for him and saw the police (A) and his younger brother and many people walking north when he arrived at Rue Ladu (on the east sidewalk).</p>
<p>He hurried up to ask what was going on and scolded his younger brother for not arguing with others, but the Vietnamese police (A) did not know that Zhu Hua and Zhu Shu were brothers, and used a stick to drive him away. Zhu Hua felt that it was unreasonable to describe, and hurried away. At this time, another Vietnamese police (B) came from behind on a bicycle (wearing a round hat near the west sidewalk). Zhu Hua thought that this person must be of a slightly higher position than the Vietnamese police (A), and hurried to tell him, asking him to mediate. Who knew that this Vietnamese police (B) thought that Zhu Hua was also one of the people who helped to cause trouble, not only did he not listen, but also hit Zhu Hua several times. Zhu Hua retreated after being beaten. This Vietnamese police (B) rushed forward and pulled Zhu Hua,</p>
<p>Walking and Hitting</p>
<p>Zhu Hua had nothing to do with this matter, and because he was unreasonable, he still retreated. At that time, the Vietnamese police (B) and Zhu Hua had walked to the corner of the west sidewalk of Rue Ladu and Avenue Lafayette. The Vietnamese police (B) was like a lunatic, holding Zhu Hua's right hand in one hand, and firing a shot at Zhu Hua's left rib, the bullet pierced through his abdomen. Zhu Hua was shot and fell to the ground. Later, an ambulance arrived and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, the bullet entered from the front left rib and exited from the back, with multiple perforations in the internal organs, liver, stomach, and intestines. It was impossible to save him, and he died at exactly 9:10 on the morning of the</p>
<p>(6th).</p>
<h3>Robbers Attempt to Steal Gun, Shot Hits Abdomen, Injuries Are Quite Serious, Gun is Eventually Taken by Force</h3>
<p>Lu Guocheng, a 43-year-old guard of Rue Pére Labouré, was on duty at around 6 PM yesterday when three robbers suddenly approached him, surrounded him, and threatened him with a gun, wanting to steal the official gun he was wearing. The guard resisted, and the robbers fired a shot at the guard, the bullet hitting his left lower abdomen. He was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robbers then forcibly took his official gun (containing six bullets) and fled in different directions without a trace. Later, nearby Chinese police arrived at the scene, and the injured Lu Guocheng was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that the injuries are serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Car for Business Trip Robbed, Picked Up Gamblers in the Nanshi</h3>
<p>A No. 17943 car for business trip of Xinzha Automobile Company, No. 391 Route des Soeurs, was driving empty through the intersection of Airdrome Road and Zhoujiazui Road in eastern Shanghai at 11:10 AM yesterday when two robbers suddenly blocked the way. One robber threatened the driver, Mr. A, with a gun and ordered him to get out of the car. The two robbers jumped into the car and drove west at high speed. Afterwards, the driver reported the incident to the police station in charge and requested an investigation. It is now heard that the car has been found in the Nanshi. It was picking up gamblers at the Xiyuan gambling den at the intersection of Zhonghua Road all day yesterday (She Wen News Agency).</p>
<h3>Robbery on Wuchang Road, Losses Exceed 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At 6:10 PM on the 9th, seven young robbers suddenly broke into the home of Cheng Qin Guan (47 years old), No. 4 Xinkang Lane, Wuchang Road. Four of them were carrying guns and forced them to hand over the safe key. Cheng Qin Guan was not at home, and there was no key left. The robbers then wanted to kidnap Cheng's two sons, Cheng Zugang (13 years old) and Cheng Zuhong (10 years old), and told them to redeem them for 40,000 yuan. Just as they were about to leave, Cheng returned home from outside. The robbers then asked him for the key and took all the cash, about 13,000 yuan, as well as rings, watches, etc., and put them in their bags. Cheng urgently wanted to report to the police station by telephone, but unexpectedly, the robbers had cut it off early. So he borrowed a phone from his neighbor and reported to the Hongkou Police Station. By the time the detectives arrived, the robbers had disappeared. They investigated the matter and made a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit over 240,000 Yuan Leather Coat: Judge Personally Inspects, Case Deemed Complex and Important, Further Hearing Ordered</h3>
<p>Zhou Zishan, the eldest grandson of the deceased wealthy salt merchant Zhou Fujiu, married Mei Yihui (57 years old this year, from Ji'an, Jiangxi, residing at No. 20, Lane 400, Avenue Road, Public Concession). After Zishan passed away, he left behind millions in assets, all managed by Mei. This includes items held on behalf of his cousin, Zhou Pengling (22 years old this year, son of Zhou Fu-jiu's fifth son, Zhou Caicheng). When Caicheng and his wife passed away, Pengling was only eight years old. The belongings were also maintained by Mei.</p>
<p>Zhou Pengling has now come of age and is seeking the return of his stored leather coat boxes from Mei. Mei claims they have been used to offset debts and refuses to return them. Therefore, Zhou Pengling, alleging that Zhou Mei is bullying an orphan, recently engaged lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Division. He seeks a judgment ordering Zhou Mei to return twenty-three boxes of leather coats or, alternatively, to compensate him with 240,000 yuan in national currency at the current market price. The case has been repeatedly heard by Judge Guo. Due to the complexity of the case, it was decided to reschedule the hearing for further testimony. Judge Guo presided over a continued hearing in the Second Civil Court. The defendant was represented by lawyer Lu Shaozong, while the plaintiff, accompanied by lawyer Dan Yuhua, strongly stated that after the plaintiff's parents passed away while he was still a child, relatives and friends inventoried and sealed over three hundred boxes of personal property, originally stored at the residence of the defendant Zhou Mei's husband, Zhou Zishan. This included twenty-three boxes of leather coats and sixteen boxes of other items. Two hundred and forty-nine boxes were stored with the second and sixth branches of the family. Due to relocation, the second and sixth branches transferred these one hundred and forty-nine boxes of stored items back to Zhou Zishan (i.e., the eldest branch). This situation can be testified to by Yang, Tianren, and Zhou Weibin. They requested that the court directly question them. Subsequently, old woman Tian Yang appeared in court and testified that Zhou Pengling's parents left behind several hundred boxes of clothing, which were later transferred to Zhou Zishan's residence. The exact number of boxes was unclear, and the box numbers were even less clear. The plaintiff's side also stated to the court that thirty-nine boxes of clothing were originally stored with the defendant. The defendant countered that eighteen boxes of leather coats were used to offset debts that Zhou Zishan had paid on behalf of the plaintiff's deceased father, eight boxes were auctioned off, and the remaining thirteen boxes were returned to the plaintiff. However, regarding the debt offsetting, the defendant was engaging in deception. The auctioned items were not from the original thirty-nine boxes stored at the defendant's residence, as can be verified by handwritten records by Zeng Duhui. Furthermore, the thirteen boxes that were retrieved were also not from the original thirty-nine boxes. The original boxes can be checked. These thirteen boxes and the auctioned items were from the two hundred and forty-nine boxes that the second and sixth branches had transferred to the defendant's residence. The court reviewed the statements and deemed it necessary to inspect the thirteen boxes that the plaintiff claimed to have retrieved. It was decided to have both parties travel by car with the judge and court clerk to the plaintiff's residence for inspection. Due to the importance of the case, it was decided to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Automobile Items: Yesterday (June 6th) at approximately 8:40 PM, a black automobile traveling west on Jing'an Temple Road lost a round copper hubcap from its rear wheel near the entrance of the Temple Lane. The hubcap had the English words "Studebaker" on it. Neither the driver nor the passengers noticed. When I picked it up, the car had already driven away. The loser can claim it within ten days, every morning at No. 1624, East End of Temple Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, at Xin Taichang Store, from Mr. Zhou.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>According to Ms. Wang Weizhen, my client, she was previously involved in a divorce lawsuit with Zhao Juzhang due to certain unfortunate circumstances. The matter was later resolved through reconciliation by relatives and friends. However, I have found that the newspaper headlines reporting on the court hearings (October 23rd and 30th) stated, "Classmate Romance Ends in Abandonment," which significantly deviates from the truth. This is because reporters cater to the general reader's interest in sensational social news, thus exaggerating the facts. Little do they know that such reporting is sufficient to damage my client's reputation. Even though the case has long been concluded, it is strange why major newspapers continue to carry such reports. I hereby request that you instruct your legal representatives to send letters to various newspapers to correct the record and restore credibility. I am sending this letter on behalf of my client, and I hope you will promptly publish it in your esteemed newspaper for clarification.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Zheng Lin-tong, November 10th</p>

<h3>"The Mysterious Illness"</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>I don't know when it started, maybe when I heard the news of the American evacuation of overseas Chinese from the Far East, our protagonist suddenly realized that something had been dug out of his body. Or maybe it's the heart. Because he vaguely felt an unusual emptiness there, probably dug up and nothing left.</p>
<p>From that time on, our protagonist began to secretly seek ways to fill that void. He didn't consult a doctor, because he thought that most doctors were unreliable. Their so-called "cut-flesh hearts" are only used to exploit patients, how can they cure diseases? It's better to heal yourself! He thought about going to Hong Kong, no, Manila, for a month or two. He first thought he could take everything with him, but then he thought: no! What about those real estate properties? Manila can't go. He can't go anywhere!</p>
<p>Isn't playing mahjong and watching dramas here also a kind of mental therapy? He "had no choice but to seek a compromise." There are plenty of mahjong partners: our protagonist has plenty of friends, social friends. There are also "subordinates"! If the boss wants to relax, the "subordinates have no choice but to accompany him. There are "experts" among the "retainers" to accompany him to watch dramas. But he's having bad luck! He loses every time he plays mahjong. The "old mahjong player" made a few jokes: grabbing a flower and forgetting to grab the "head"! The symphony of gongs, drums, and suonas seemed like something from another world to him. He only felt that the void seemed to be expanding, expanding. Before long, he became disgusted with the one hundred and thirty-six tiles and the "expert".</p>
<p>This development, because it was latent, was not discovered by anyone, even by our protagonist's wife, who was a confidante, and he did not want to be discovered. When receiving friends, he still laughed loudly. Maybe the laughter seemed more uninhibited than before, but this was not enough to attract the attention of his friends. When those friends thought about the increase in land prices, they thought they guessed the reason for his laughter, and echoed it with an embarrassed knowing smile. When meeting with subordinates, he still "applied both kindness and strictness". Or maybe he spoke a little louder. As for his family, he was still serious, kind, and always maintained a considerable distance from them.</p>
<p>But that void seemed to be gradually expanding, until one day at a banquet. That day he was particularly excited: he drank half a glass of "whiskey", and his appetite suddenly became very good. Regardless of etiquette, he ate all ten or so dishes until the bottom of the plates was visible. While wiping his mouth with a napkin, he stroked his heart with satisfaction: "Great! Great!" Suddenly, he noticed that the person sitting next to him was smiling at him, so he said peacefully: "I mean today's dishes are great. Aren't they?"</p>
<p>That night, when he returned home, he fell asleep soundly. Maybe it was because he was tired, or maybe that void had been filled. In short, our protagonist had a sweet sleep that he hadn't had for a long time.</p>
<p>The next day, when the morning light was dim, he woke up. The first action was to press his hand on his heart. The hand fell down weakly. That "mysterious illness" returned with the morning light!</p>
<p>He jumped out of bed, pressed the doorbell, and ordered the servants to bring breakfast. Without brushing his teeth, he began to devour it. He complained that the servants had made the breakfast too exquisite: too little bread and only a little milk. The servants were surprised and added two more servings for him.</p>
<p>He ate until he was out of breath, and stroked his heart. But "God bless"! "What are you doing standing here?" he roared at the stunned servant.</p>
<p>In this way, our protagonist continued to constantly seek ways to fill that void. Look: he is frowning alone, one hand pressed on his heart, thinking, thinking about that method...</p>
<h3>Seen, Heard, and Felt</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>One day, I ran into the public reading room of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library on Beijing Road and saw a notice in English on the newspaper rack, roughly meaning, "Each person can read a certain newspaper for no more than ten minutes, and must hand it over to others who need to read it." That can give some warning to the general selfish readers of public libraries, right?</p>
<h3>Escape the Sea of Suffering and Reach the Other Shore Together; Willing to Assist Those with Aspirations to Abstain from Addictions</h3>
<p>— Yang Shaoqing</p>
<p>In my early years, I became addicted to smoking due to illness. After the Incident, prices soared, and living expenses continued to increase, causing me both mental and economic distress. Therefore, I made a firm decision to quit. However, at first, due to improper methods, I suffered greatly and did not succeed. This spring, through a friend's introduction, I underwent treatment at the Chinese Anti-Smoking Sanatorium. Director Jin Xuegao carefully examined my physical condition and applied both tonic and detoxifying methods, treating the disease and eliminating the addiction at the same time. In just over a month, I quit smoking without any pain, and my chronic illness was also cured. After being discharged from the hospital, my diet and weight both increased, and my body is now healthy and my mind is full of energy, a complete transformation. Since escaping the sea of suffering, I have greatly reduced my expenses, and my mind and body are at ease. I am also able to concentrate on my business operations without being afraid of complexity or hardship. The benefits to the economic aspect are certainly not small. In addition to my private joy, I am thinking of the young and promising people in society who suffer from the same illness as I did. There are quite a few people who are misled by bad habits and suffer endless harm. Those who are determined to quit are either limited by economic conditions or have not found good methods, resulting in procrastination and failure to extricate themselves. Not only is their future ruined, but society and the country also suffer losses as a result. Thinking of this, I am deeply moved. Therefore, based on the principle of establishing oneself and helping others, I am planning to rescue the hungry and the drowning. I am willing to use the money saved after quitting smoking to help those with aspirations to quit their addictions. Director Jin has also been enthusiastically supporting me, agreeing to fully fulfill his obligations in terms of technology. All expenses for medicine, food, etc., will be borne and paid by me. However, my family is not wealthy, and I can only support two people per month. All young people who are addicted to smoking, are determined to quit, and have no economic means can seek a reliable guarantor and submit a letter to Tong Taixing at No. 9 Xingsheng Street, French Concession, for registration. After passing the examination, they can be admitted to the hospital for treatment (the hospital is located at No. 454 Malang Road). The above-mentioned measures are provisionally set for one year. I know that this small amount will have a very limited effect and will not enable all compatriots who are mired in the darkness to reach the other shore. However, one person's ability is limited, and I am only doing my best. I hope that people from all walks of life will follow suit and expand and popularize it, so that the poisonous atmosphere will be eliminated, directly benefiting compatriots in the sea of suffering, and indirectly nourishing the vitality of the country and the nation. This is what I sincerely pray for.</p>

<p>Hawthorne Detective Agency</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>Shi Gui reported: "Mr. Hawthorne, there's an old man who wants to see you, he looks very strange. I asked him for a business card, but he couldn't produce one, and he wouldn't say his name."</p>
<p>Hawthorne stopped walking and nodded, saying, "Alright, please let him in." He then turned on the two electric lamps on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Before long, an old man with white hair and a white beard, a face full of wrinkles, wearing a wide black silk robe, walked in slowly with his head down and his back bent. The old man's shoulders were quite broad, and if his back wasn't bent, his height would probably exceed Hawthorne's. As soon as he came in, he seemed very familiar, cupping his hands repeatedly towards Hawthorne, making rough, hoarse sounds. "Mr. Hawthorne." He then turned around and cupped his hands towards me. "Mr. Bao."</p>
<p>I felt that the old man's manners were very attentive, and in my opinion, I had to return the courtesies. I hurriedly stood up and bowed, and just as I was about to ask his name, Hawthorne suddenly bent over and spoke before I could.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhao, please sit down."</p>
<p>The old man's body trembled slightly. This same instinctive movement immediately affected me. Mr. Zhao? Zhao Boxiong? My hand involuntarily reached into my pocket.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's eyes clearly saw my action, and he said gently, "Bao Lang, take it easy. This is Mr. Zhao Boxiong. -- But this is only his temporarily assumed name. Mr. Zhao, isn't it?"</p>
<p>The old man suddenly chuckled. He was no longer surprised, nor did he appear flustered. "Mr. Hawthorne, I can't help but admire your eyesight. You are truly capable!" As he spoke, he sat down on a sofa in front of the desk.</p>
<p>Hawthorne also sat down and replied coldly, "So, your purpose in dressing like this is to give my eyes a chance to be tested?"</p>
<p>The fake old man Zhao Boxiong quickly interjected, "No, Mr. Hawthorne, you misunderstand. To be honest, I wouldn't dare come out of Fengtai without this disguise, for fear of encountering unnecessary trouble. The thin man you sent to follow me is indeed very capable. I only realized that someone was watching outside the store when I arrived at Fengtai. I admire him. He followed me all the way, and I didn't even notice." (16)</p>

<h3>Are Cosmetics a Waste?</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Some people say that buying cosmetics is a waste, but in fact, it is not absolutely accurate.</p>
<p>Of course, if we imitate many European and American women and put a group of cosmetics on the dressing table, and bandage the face and neck at night as if someone has suffered an accidental injury, it is not necessary. However, by using cosmetics to express inherent advantages and conceal unattractive flaws, it seems that women can retain this right.</p>
<p>A woman in love, through the help of cosmetics, becomes a lifelong companion with her lover, gives birth to promising children, and is able to do some work for the country, then this kind of beauty work is very meaningful.</p>
<p>A clever wife, using cosmetics to maintain her beauty for a long time, so that her husband will not go out and wander, then the price paid for cosmetics becomes a useful investment.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the true principles of beauty, the entire part of beauty work also includes the two necessary conditions of health and cleanliness. To obtain the true effect of beauty, the first step is to ensure that there is no dirt in the pores of our skin, and that each cell of our skin is full of vitality. This basic work is very important for the health of our whole body, so because the use of cosmetics, the implementation of beauty indirectly promotes the health of the body, the benefits obtained are more than the money spent.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we recognize the goal and do not buy blindly, cosmetics are not a waste. And the publication of this magazine is not a waste of ink either.</p>
<h3>Psychological Beauty Work</h3>
<p>— Fangfei</p>
<p>Don't let the pain of life be depicted on your face</p>
<p>In this complex era of personnel affairs, it is not enough to carry out beauty work only from the surface, because there is also a psychological aspect that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>No matter how young and beautiful you are, everyday life will often leave a deep phenomenon on your face. We mostly have a special facial expression, and let our emotions—troubles, fears, or joys—show on the face. Just look at those middle-aged women, there are often many wrinkles on their faces, so never think that you are in the best period of youth, prevention is a very important work.</p>
<p>The beauty of youth on the face is expressed in the eyes, so you must not ignore the beauty of the eyes. Don't narrow your eyes when looking at things, because this action easily forms an aging appearance.</p>
<p>Don't often frown, because after getting used to it, it will not only damage your appearance, but also harm your character. Squinting should also be avoided. If you need it under the light, then it doesn't matter to wear glasses, don't squint your eyes. If you read a lot or do delicate handicrafts, you should have enough light.</p>
<p>If you are often frowning, you should develop the habit of smiling, because smiling can remove wrinkles on your forehead. Many people tend to wrinkle their nose when they smile, which is irrelevant when they are young, or even beautiful, but at a certain time, unpleasant lines will appear on the nose.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the mouth: Do you deliberately manipulate your lips when you speak or listen to others? Or make all kinds of gestures with your mouth? Or bite your lip? These situations should not be allowed to continue, because they will change the texture of your mouth.</p>
<p>It is best to study yourself every so often, and you will have many discoveries: Are you feeling tired? Are you unwilling to attend any banquets? You should think about increasing your energy, or because you lack a certain vitamin. In this case, it is best to see a doctor, because many people often lose their beauty due to physical weakness.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you are researching, you will find that the decline in facial beauty is due to the feet. According to scientific records, wearing a pair of shoes that are too tight will often show a painful appearance on the face, and this pain is also very harmful to the nervous system.</p>
<p>Speaking of nerves, you may become restless because of disappointment or stimulation, and thus become irritable and sleepless at night. This phenomenon can immediately be expressed on your face. Of course, we cannot restrain emotions and prevent them from being expressed on the face, but it is actually possible to find ways to reduce this pain.</p>
<p>Troubles can cause wrinkles around the eyes, and sorrow often shows its existence from the mouth and eyes. The most damaging thing to appearance is fear. To avoid these emotions of trouble, sorrow, and fear, you can analyze the facts. There are really many things that are not worth worrying, being sad, or being afraid of.</p>
<p>Therefore, to obtain true beauty, in addition to using appropriate cosmetics, it is also necessary to maintain a healthy body and restrain emotions that damage beauty.</p>
<h3>Talking about Skin Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Ling Naiping</p>
<p>If the metabolism of your subcutaneous cells is abnormal, then the appearance of your skin will inevitably be loose, wrinkled, dry, rough, and dark. Even due to the decline in skin color, even though you are still young, you will lose your youthful grace. But in this current era of 20th-century scientific omnipotence, there is no need to worry, because nutritional and healthy skin beauty products have been launched. For example, "Pehchaolin," the latest product of Changbeikang Cosmetics Co., Ltd., is a skin agent specially designed to nourish skin cells, supply subcutaneous fat, cleanse the dirt in pores, and shrink pores. According to experience, it is best to apply "Pehchaolin" all over the face and hands before going to bed, because its pore-cleansing work can exert its effectiveness even more. For daytime application, it can be used as a foundation, and at the same time, it can protect against the invasion of climate and prevent the skin from being stimulated by sun and wind. This will not only nourish and protect your skin, but also promote the foundation of your beauty—fair skin and creamy texture, so that your youth will last forever, even if you are older, your grace must not</p>
<h3>Talking about Perming</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>If someone says to you: "Your hair is permed as if it were natural," this is really not a compliment. Because a truly beautiful perm should be natural. To make the results of a perm good, there are several prerequisites: First, the hair must be in perfect condition. Before perming, there should be several days of combing, brushing, and applying oil; Second, the shampoo used when washing hair before perming is also very important. The nature of this shampoo should not be too strong, because after being too strong, it will wash away the oil in the scalp, and this oil is very precious.</p>
<p>Many people think that hair will return to its original state after being permed, but this is not the case. A well-permed hair can remain curly for a long time. Of course, the hair is growing, so the curly part droops down and is soon cut off. There are several types of perming machines, and the latest one can avoid contact with hair, which is called "wireless perm." Using chemicals, placing them on the hair, after a considerable period of time, the hair becomes wavy.</p>
<p>The time required for perming has been greatly reduced. Thirty years ago, Charles Nestle, who first invented the first perming machine, used it for the first time in London. It took eight to ten hours to perm the hair of a woman, so he only permed 72 times from 1905 to 1909. The current rate is different. In various countries of England and America, 37.5 million perms are performed every year. In the beginning, many members of the royal family had suffered eight to ten hours of torture under Nestle's hands, and the price of each perm was 250 US dollars. Compared with the present, that is a world of difference.</p>
<p>After perming, hairbrushes should be used every day, which can make the curly shape more beautiful and make the hair softer and prevent hair loss. But be sure not to use hot water to comb your hair. The proper way is to use hair oil. Secondly, when perming, you may wish to do some experimental work and try your hair to see which style is best for perming.</p>

<h3>Seven Facial Shapes: Which Type Do You Belong To?</h3>
<p>According to Hollywood beauty expert Westmore, there are seven natural facial shapes: oval, diamond, triangle, inverted triangle, round, square, and rectangle. The most ideal is the oval shape, which is what we call a "goose egg face."</p>
<p>Among movie stars, you can find representatives of each shape. If the reader refers to the shapes of these people, you can know which type you belong to:</p>
<p>Oval: Gale Page. Diamond: Jane Wyman.</p>
<p>Triangle: Jane Bryan.</p>
<p>Inverted Triangle: Anita Louise.</p>
<p>Round: Priscilla Lane. Square: Ann Sheridan.</p>
<p>Rectangle: Lya Lys.</p>
<h3>Wartime Beauty Products for German Women</h3>
<p>In wartime Germany, women are no longer allowed to use soap, creams, or milk for beauty treatments. However, the preservation of women's beauty has not been neglected. Ms. Luo Mei, a beauty expert from the German Labor Front, has provided the following items for German women:</p>
<p>1.  Since soap cannot be used, ivy leaves are a good substitute because they can be used for outdoor bathing.</p>
<p>2.  Washing the face with milk is no longer possible. This can be replaced with rainwater mixed with wild chestnut juice. The method involves peeling the wild chestnuts, drying them in the sun, grinding them, cooking them, and adding water to create an excellent face wash.</p>
<p>3.  As for the vitamins needed by the body, one can eat cabbage, carrots, celery, and apples.</p>
<h3>Various Perfumes</h3>
<p>— Wei Min</p>
<p>Among cosmetics, perfume occupies a very important position. Making perfume is truly an art rather than a science. If two printers print the same photograph, the results will never be the same. Similarly, if two perfume makers use the same raw materials, they will never produce the same perfume.</p>
<p>Because perfume production is not easy, the cost of perfume is very high. For example, with jasmine, the flowers must be picked in the morning while the early dew is still on them. Then, the petals are placed in a dish lined with wax. The next day, the petals are discarded, and newly picked petals are added. This process is repeated every day for an entire season. Then, the flower oil is extracted from the wax. To make two pounds of flower oil, 25,000 pounds of fresh flowers are needed. Therefore, the value of these two pounds of flower oil can reach US$700 to $800. This type of oil is often placed in metal boxes and preserved like jewelry.</p>
<p>Many people apply perfume directly to their skin, but this is not appropriate because some people's skin is acidic. When perfume touches the skin, a chemical reaction occurs, and the fragrance immediately disappears. Therefore, it is best to apply perfume to clothing. The lapel and cuffs are very suitable places. Never apply perfume to the hair because the oils in some people's hair cannot mix with the oils in the perfume. This is the same principle as why perfume should not be applied to fur.</p>
<p>After purchasing perfume, its preservation is very important. Each bottle should be tightly stoppered to avoid light and heat. Otherwise, your perfume will disappear invisibly in a very short period. If you find that the perfume has a cloudy appearance, then you can be sure that someone has stolen some and added water.</p>
<h3>Beauty Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>Here are many methods that may be useful for reference:</p>
<p>To make teeth white, in addition to daily toothpaste, you can use lemon juice and salt to brush your teeth once a week. When using lipstick, if you use a deep red lipstick, it can make your teeth appear very white.</p>
<p>When the skin on your hands appears purple or brown, you can rub it with sweet potato to make the skin white and tender immediately.</p>
<p>Brief News: Lincoln Medicinal Toothpaste, well-known in the market, has been sold in China for nearly three years. Because of its low price and high quality, it is popular everywhere and praised by word of mouth. Recently, the company initiated a "brushing teeth before bedtime movement," widely advocating it through letters, which is very beneficial for oral hygiene.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to meet Mr. Zhu, the Chinese manager of the company, who informed me that Lincoln Little Tuo Rouge, which the company has been preparing for a long time, will also be launched on the market within the next ten days. In addition, soaps, powders, hair wax, and cold creams for both winter and summer will also be available to the public one after another.</p>
<p>The snow creams popular on the market are often crudely made, and it is difficult to distinguish their quality and fragrance. Only the Sister Cream produced by the Jiangsheng Chemical Factory has a particularly great effect. After washing the face and before going to bed, once applied, the skin immediately becomes moisturized and delicate. If you then apply the Four Blessings Brand Modern Fragrant Powder produced by the same factory, it will be absorbed and adhered, making your face radiant. It is sold at department stores and pharmacies in various cities.</p>
<p>When you want to put on makeup, have you ever thought about who taught you how to do it? Now, I would like to introduce you to a book called "The Book of Beauty." There is a "Beauty Memorandum" in it that will teach you complete and practical makeup methods. Furthermore, this book also contains ten kinds of exquisite cosmetics, such as creams, powders, lipsticks, and eyebrow pencils, for you to experiment with (because this book is also a novel cosmetic case). Then, you will surely be able to apply makeup in a very charming way!</p>
<h3>Hollywood Beauty Experts Tell You How to Measure Your Face</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Whether your face meets the standards is perhaps a question you are very eager to know. Now, Hollywood beauty expert Weiss Moore has developed a method for you. Why not try it?</p>
<p>Take a Photo</p>
<p>The first step is to take a photo. When taking the photo, you should look straight at the camera (or choose an appropriate one from all your photos, but do not choose a photo with the face turned diagonally or upward, because it is very difficult to do measurements with a non-frontal photo).</p>
<p>The second step is to draw two straight lines and three horizontal lines on the first picture on the left. You can then see the entire area of your face.</p>
<p>Is Your Forehead Too High?</p>
<p>After you have drawn the lines on your photo, you can see if your forehead is too high. If it is too high, then you can comb your hair lower, covering part of the forehead with hair.</p>
<p>If the distance between your eyes and hair is less than the distance between your eyes and lips, then you should comb your hair higher.</p>
<p>Is Your Mouth Too Narrow or Too Wide?</p>
<p>To judge whether your mouth is too narrow or too wide, you can smile in front of a mirror. The corners of your mouth when smiling should align with the center of your pupils (see the second picture). If the mouth is too narrow or too wide, you can use lipstick to remedy the natural shortcomings.</p>
<p>People with lips that are too wide can apply lipstick thicker in the middle of the mouth and then fade it outward. If the mouth is too narrow, then you can apply lipstick more narrowly.</p>
<p>Do Not Let the Lines Droop</p>
<p>In the third picture, you can see the lines of the face: eyebrows, eyes, or lips. When applying makeup, never let these lines droop, because after drooping, it will show a look of worry, which will cause unlimited damage to the beauty of the entire face.</p>
