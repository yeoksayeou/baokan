<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本謀和的誠僞</h3>
<p>社評偶因日本都新聞稱述一重慶最好在日本正式承認南京新政府以前。考慮和平，」遂縱論中日兩國和戰問題：茲續得東京電訊，乃知穴空風生，都新聞所稱述的自有其來因。電謂：</p>
<p>獲消息靈通方面宣佈，日官方已公然表示，日政府爲結束「中國事件」計，正謀與重慶中國政府舉行直接談判，以期成立中日間之「和平」。聞日御前會議所討論之事件，卽係此項問題，該會議中曾決定承認江寗「組織」前，再作中日直接談「和」之最後努力，如此項努力仍歸失敗，則日方卽將承認江寗「組織」。又據可靠方面稱，日外相松岡已直告美國駐日大使格魯。謂日本願與蔣介石將軍談「和」，彼本人且擬親自與蔣將軍「發生接觸」以期談判此事。彼並請求美國在日本作此「和平」努力時，勿在太平洋作任何舉動，免致碍及談判之可能性，或增加華方對日之抵抗。又據悉，在華之日軍領袖，亦已贊同日政府此項決定，決對松岡進行中日「和平」之工作，予以最後一决的機會。至日政府所願提出之和平條件，日方秘不宣洩，而所謂「直接談判」，何從進行，亦未宣露云。</p>
<p>假使電傳不訛，則所得吸引國際興趣，自在都新聞稱述之上。據聞華盛頓方面得此消息後，美國當局未加評論，但頗有人以為這是日本和平攻勢之一，其目的在乎緩和美日兩國目前的緊張關係，並作秘密準備南進的烟幕；並以為中國奮鬥三年有餘，爭取最後勝利的決心愈益堅强，自必作戰到底，拒絕日方此項建議云云。華盛頓方面如此觀察，可以暫置不問：重慶方面如何反應，却是尙無所聞</p>
<p>自從强暴與詐欺在國際漸决抬了頭，國際道德觀念便一落千丈；於是凡屬可疑的，不得不疑其極惡：容或可信的，不得不信其不然。有如捷克先被出賣於慕尼黑，再被宰割於小能動彈之中；又如法國接受越南協定，豈小以為祇是假道授華，有鄰為壑，那知開門揖盜，自遭其殃；這是强暴與詐欺下最顯著的犧牲者。顯例不遠。誰復輕信外交辭令；况在屢失信用之後，發此支離矛盾之談！故東電所傳日外相松岡的表示，大的小會有何結果吧！蓋所謂「日政府所願提出之和平條件，秘不宣洩，」「所謂直接談判從何進行，亦未披露，」誠使聞者無可捉摸，然問題豈在於此；談判的問題不在直接或不直接，條件的問題只是中國要獨立自由，要領土主權完整，這兩項，似是問題而皆非問題；申言之，假定日本所提條件而有損中國的領土主權，有碍中國的獨立自由，則根本不必談判，亦根本無望和平。</p>
<p>根據東電，現在還談不到如何談判，如何條件；不但如此，我們為日本國運打算，雖以為日本應有求和誠意，故對於日本當局的當局的表示謀和，並不以為意外，乃東電所述日本當局態度，不但謀和的誠意不足，抑且對於當前問題的認識不足；兩者不足，則所謂如何條件，所謂如何談判，皆屬多餘的問題。何以言之？有兩大端：（一）中日兩國之間，積年累月，確有甚多甚大的懸案，久而未決，然兩國固相處於和平狀態之中；及至日本破壞了和平狀態，軍事攻勢與政治攻勢踵接而來，於是中國不得不從事抗戰。時閱三年有餘，日本既從事實上證明各種攻勢的無效，感悟到恢復兩國和平狀態的必要，則其程序要在放棄其所有對華的各種攻勢，此外無所謂講和。容或有待『講』的，祗是在日本開始放棄以迄完成其放棄的過程之中，將如何由雙方妥商，在技術上取得中國善意的協力，藉以避免不必要的犧牲。現在日本議不出此，還以與國民政府毫無關係，目與和戰的事實局勢毫無關係的所謂承認問題，不意此為對於國民政府的要挾。此其意態，無異於謂謀和無效，則將繼續其攻勢；此其實際，無異於一面宣告攻勢的無效，一面企圖以無效了的攻勢竟用之於要挾而有效。如此謀和，如何和得？（二）中國為被侵略而抗戰，為保全獨立自由與領土主權的完整而抗戰，抗戰時期當然殷求與國。當然希望外援；况抗戰的客觀影響，使中國以外的若干國家蒙受中國抗戰制勝的利益，則他國予以厚援，自屬當然。這在認識不足者，甚或故意曲解者，以為中國專為他國利益而代戰，以為中國因有他國援厚而始戰；充此歪曲的見解之所至，以為中國作戰祇因他國鼓勵，他國不援則中國不戰。原來宣傳家作此歪曲宣傳，徒見宣傳拙劣，終於無效，猶可說也：若乃政治家有此歪曲認識，則導其國家於錯誤的岐途，陷其國家於不拔的深淵，其愚其謬，眞不可諒。如東電稱述日外相松罔向美國駐日的格魯大使所語，「請求美國在日本作此和平努力時，勿在太平洋作任何舉動，免致礙及談判之可能性，或增加華方對日之抵述；」若說這不是松罔之愚之謬，則必是松岡之歪曲的外交辭令</p>
<p>退百步。試以至愚的至誠來解釋吧：松岡一切表示，一切辭令，有其掩護日本顏面之不得已的苦心孤詣，而其眞心實意還是求和。則今後動態，惟趨兩途：其一，由日本以事實行動，開始放棄其各種攻勢，以證明其謀和的眞誠：其二，由中國的抗戰，與美國在太平洋的舉動，以及中國其他友國的迅速力援中國，使日本充實其求和的眞誠！有了眞誠，纔有益於大局。</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（三）　法國悲劇中三主角　（二）見得到做不到的甘茂林</h3>
<p>一九三八年中，陰雲密布，對於法國執政諸公，已充分表示危機。我那時和他們談到甘茂林的機會極多。我常問道：不知甘茂林將軍的意下如伺；」</p>
<p>我聽說法國政府曾舉行兩决重要會議：一决在五月間芷發生危機之際，一决則在慕尼克協定之前。出席省都是國防外交兩部大員和海陸空軍當局，他們以達拉第為核心，組成一個非正式的戰時內閣。他們要答覆一個重要問題：「假使法國不得不起而作戰，有此實力嗎？」當時海軍部長達爾朗答道：「海軍儘可一戰，且有英國艦隊相助，海上可以無憂。」這話確非欺人之談。</p>
<p>空軍部長費育明先前曾由德國空軍部長戈林將軍邀往柏林：戈林曾把德國空軍的準備情形，竭力鋪張，使他懾伏。會議時費育明仲張兩臀，露着絕望的神情說道：「開戰後只要兩星期，法國所有飛機便一架不剩了。」及到九月間，他精神更頽喪，還加了一句傷心人語，他說：「在開戰之初，我軍祗好用空軍後備隊作戰，他們的被敵擊落，可以預卜。優秀的空軍戰士却須留待後用，等到有了優良的飛機，始可派出作戰。」</p>
<p>至於甘茂林呢？他在九月間同在五月裏的態度，是一致的。他對於那兩位並不一顧，便饒有深意地微笑說道：「陸軍巳在待命。」</p>
<p>有一天，我對外交部長龐納說：「假使陸軍準備充分，便沒有空軍也不妨。不過我軍却不能進攻齊格飛防綫！這可怎麼辦呢！我們應該事先有個作戰計劃。你想甘茂林可有計劃嗎？」</p>
<p>「聽說他已胸有成竹。」</p>
<p>我所探聽着的不過如此，龐納所知道的是吾比我更切實些，無從判斷。甘茂林和達拉第，都是「絨口的金人。」就是對於達拉第，這位總司令曾吾向之說明作戰計劃，也在不可知之數。</p>
<p>據我個人胡猜，甘茂林或將利用德義方面大吹大擂的宜傳羅馬柏林軸心之際，把義大利的命運與德國牽在一起，一俟戰爭發作，便先發制人，猛攻義國，以側擊德國。龐納却答道：「你的假想，在五月中或尙可用，現已九月中旬，阿繭卑斯山隘早經封鎖不通了」</p>
<p>一九三八年秋，我和衆議院議長赫禮歐在外交部附近人行道並肩同行。</p>
<p>他說：「我們對義大利太要好了，但以為祇要向她卑躬屈節，便可相安無事，就未免太可笑，太危險了。」</p>
<p>我答道：「義大利輿論比較政府還要値到注意，應當使之充分了解義國地位的脆弱。我們的總參謀部洞悉此事嗎？科西嘉島方而，我們的準備，還未十分充實呢。」</p>
<p>赫禮歐點頭道：「甘茂林嗎，你知道他並不一味恃勇，這原是不錯，我就怕他太畏葸些。」</p>
<p>我聽到這種明白爽直的說話，並且出自有力者的口中，還是第一决呢。</p>
<p>一九三九年八月，戰爭爆發前一星期，我和政府接觸頻繁。我們一致希望和平仍能保持，龐納更是非常盡職，努力不懈。不過局勢巳漸趨回軍事方面。「甘茂林意下如何？」這問題也愈加被人提及了。</p>
<p>據一般人的印象，甘茂林對於陸軍很放心，對於空軍卻很憂慮。我們的空軍非至十一月中不能準備充分。他希望德國空軍不會過於打破他的動員計劃。幸而防空方面巳有充分的接濟。</p>
<p>八月二十六日是我永遠不會忘記的一日。那天原是我的生辰，有一位外國政界要人，路過巴黎，相與談及一件萬分緊急的事情。</p>
<p>他在我所遇見過的政治家中，是個數一數二的人物，我能和他見面，總算三生有幸。祗是為了許多原因，我不得不一反知無不言，言無不盡的作風，把他姓名隱去。</p>
<p>我同他見面之後，略一寒喧，他就說道：「大局的嚴重，想已盡知，不必再嚕囌了。我看戰事在幾天之內，恐怕就要發作。我很為法國和英國擔憂，他們對於戰爭，認為一件可恨的事，戰爭結果如何，却並小顧慮到。這眞是大錯特錯。假使你們缺乏理想，勇敢，和創造力，休想獲勝。假使你們只想避重就輕，畏難苟安，你們在未戰之前，早已失收了。這眞是言之可怕。我知道你有左右政府的能力。請進言達拉第，並對龐納說：『墨索里尼雖不是聰明人，但是一個最狡猾的角色，他正要向你們施展絕大的詭計。他會暫時靜伏，待機而動。他在希特勤勝利可操左券的前一兩星期，會向你們宣戰，和希特勒共分杯羹呢。』</p>
<p>他接下去道：「貴國政府必須立即要求墨索里尼：『為敵為友，須在四十八小時之內決定。』墨索里尼力避在目下牽入戰爭滬渦。他對於本國的空軍和砲隊實力，素來不甚了然，最近始接到使他失望的報吿。義大利與論也反對參戰。假使墨索里尼飾辭答覆允守中立，便向他要求允許法軍佔領都林和米蘭等幾個重要城市，並允許法軍假道。倘使他以參戰恫嚇，便把時局的眞相和法國的態度，吿訴義大利國民。不出兩星期，墨索里尼必然傾覆。法國若一味向墨索里尼獻媚，後患便不　設想。」</p>
<p>他又繼續說下去道：「英國人比較遲鈍，邱吉爾又未握權。他們梢後自會知道。貴國政府當然要和參謀部商量。這眞是荒唐！參謀人員其實不過是國家的公俟。我也曾掌過國政，懂得他們的心理。他們一味怕麻煩，力求减輕責任，和文官一般無二。他們服從成性。假使你去向他們徵求意見，他們必然連連搖手說：『不可！不可！現在的事已够麻煩了。」所以你不要向他們『這事應不應做」！你只要問：『假使你們受命去做，將如何辦？』」</p>
<p>我答道：「還是由你直接去說，不必由我轉達吧。我可為先容，屆時我也可在塲從旁裹助。」</p>
<p>為避免間諜耳目起見，某某要人於翌日星期日在我的寓所晤談。那位政治家談鋒甚健，一如咋日，使人留下深刻的印象。（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食　米價不能仰平　顯爲投機者所把持　但看洋米絡繹而來　本市絕無匱乏之虞</h3>
<p>洋米昨日經數度盤旋後、卒於下午趨跌一元至一元半、當上午開市後、因爾洋米到源絡繹、中貨亦以滙平劃宜、因此人心趨平、開價立卽下跌、繼有散囤問津、市父回好、倏升倐降、漲落不一、至午收祇扯小三四角而巳、午後市上謠言　起、而和平之說、允不利於買戶、市乃銳落元外、結果比週六較小一元外至一元五六角、一號西貢高自七十四元半、次至七十二元半、二號六十九元半、六十八元半、火絞高自七十二元半、决至六十九元、二號暹邏六十七元叫角至六十六元二角、小絞六十六元八角六十六兀半、米菉五十九元五十八元半、碎米五十五元半五十四兀、蕪湖尖六十七元二角六十七元、惟回籠原包尚有新囤散多問津、跌風較緩、但曾有大部份期貨亦較小半元至一元許、售開現貨原包八十二元半至八十二元、十一月份八十一元至八十元零五角、十二月份七十九兀至七十八元半、午後則開七十八元至七十七元八角、小絞十二月初旬七十七元至七十六元半、統計有七百多噸成交、現米則有近萬包、新交易據傳由合義售出十二月份一號一千噸、價八十二元、回籠一號十二月份則自八十二元回至八十一元半</p>
<p>洋米到滬甚旺、怡和洋行永生輪前日（十六日）下午到埠、自香港裝來三千三百丸十三包、又該行阜生輪同日傍晚抵滬、亦由香港裝來五千二百六十八包、昨日又有太古公司湖南輪自香港來滬、計裝來二千六百四十包、聞今日法公司金第亞號輪到埠、由西貢直接裝來一萬四千餘包、嗣後港越絡續而來、本市絕無缺乏米糧可言、故米價不能抑平、顯然爲投機奢所操縱、（祖）</p>
<p>新粳尖及野稻菉種等兩朝共到二千來石、而銷塲方面因見烊米平淡、本街納胃蛟懈、致際到吒市面不過平平、新粳原句開九十叫元至丸十元、斛見中關八十八元三角、决至八十五元半、野稻丸十三元九十元、茶種斛見八十六兀八十四元半、杜洋尖乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米國洋兩貨、去路亦見轉　、不過貨主尚無鬆脫之　、市面並呈定局、官溧貨仍須八十三四兀、香港七十六元、七十三四元、糯菉六十五元半、决至六十二元牛、</p>
<h3>洋粉客銷微動</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉交易、略見活動、本街進胃較貪、計由福阜兩廠批出近萬包、廠槃仍爲十七元、而前日新釗之澳洲洋粉、總額二萬餘包、後批亦已裝出、雖未到達、人心則巳平穩、高牌洋砲台價仍十九元、新到貨價售十八兀六角半至六角、聞有北洋幫辦去三千包左右、老車脾回籠貨仍討十九元之價、但無妥議、</p>
<p>小麥來源仍寂、日廠拋進之貨、因以運輸困難、尚未解齊、新交易更鮮開展、聞日廠進價仍爲二十六兀、租界存棧貨沽價二十七八元、每日僅二三百包、均爲直接配貨、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯起伏狹隘</h3>
<p>外匯日市况、滙豐掛牌悉無上落、英美匯暗市、變動頗狹、此以走勢不定、乃受和平謠言之影響、投機商雖時來吐售、而華行及外行均肯吸入、價格始終平穩、美匯五元九〇六二五、易結易賣、至晚價比上週六則軋鬆〇一五六二五、與〇三一二五、計英金三辦士七六五六二五、、美匯五元九〇六二五、期貨本月份與現貨相同、下月份已稍拔開、</p>
<p>港方首先轉售</p>
<p>晨初以匯兌英對美滬等均平、美對英未變更、對滬跌五分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七五、美滙五元八七五、比上週末收市兩匯俱平、開後市面穩靜、而港電先售予外行現先令計三辦士七六五六二五、故價稍見硬化、九時半匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平街稅揭曉無上落、此時投機商等傾向叶售、計出外行本月份　匯五元九〇六二五、迨至十一時後華商外行等續塞美匯、尚以華行及英行有利等稍有吃胃、再略微鬆、計外行華商賣予有利華行等十二月份美匯亦爲五元九〇六二五、午收英金現貨三辦士七穴五六二五、美匯五元九〇六二五、比晨開英美各長〇一五六二五、與〇三一二五、</p>
<p>英美結果軋鬆</p>
<p>後市　狀仍穩、上落極微、投機家售予華行大陸本月份美匯五元九三七五、又港電塞十二月份美　計外行吸入俱爲五元九〇六二五、晚收結果現貨及本月份英金爲三辦十七六五六二五、美滙五元九〇六二五、下月份英金三辦士七五、美匯五元八七五、較之上星期六收、英金現貨近期軋鬆〇一五六二五、美匯硬〇三一二五、遠期悉平、</p>

<h3>和平空氣　金市所跌尚微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、受國內外和平之謠激動、致初穩後疲、買賣尚稱熱烈、人心薰受濃厚之和平空氣後、異常恍惚、買方勇氣、相當减少、而因外滙未見十分鬆硬、致跌時搜購者仍有、午後一度降至五千六百三十五元低價、外滙所鬆有限、美金並起回風、補空之風亦起、飛上五十元左右、收盤回達五千六百八十二元、比上週六收軋跌二十六元、全日交易的四千兩、現金比期交價低十兀、掉期未做開、銀樓飾金終則軋小十元、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌廿六元</p>
<p>晨初人心頗昂、開盤卽見抬高、計銀號進證券幫十兩、爲五千七百三十元、繼入錢兌業二十兩、續漲十元、爲五千七百四十五元、嗣因外滙稍形硬化、證券幫曁錢兌業銀號等一致來塞、一霎時即回挫至七百元關內、計證卷出金號三十兩、告五千六百七十五元、惟不久金銀號買　頓萌、入市購進、價遂抬高、計金號入證卷二十兩、重達五千七白十元、奈此後又復不振、塲內空氣利空、金銀號反吐證券幫再賣、低價層出、最賤爲金號出銀號二十兩、僅五千六百五十五元收盤、銀號對做二十兩、吿五千六百六十八元、午後開盤銀號對做二十兩、爲五千六百六十五元、後因證券幫力塞、降落數十元、計銀號出證券幫三十兩、吿五千六自三十五兀、惟聞外滙仍平、銀號錢兌業等購入若干、致回好至五千六百八十七兀、計金號淮銀號二十兩是也、後稍　十餘兀、延至晚收、金號入銀號十兩、吿五千六百八十二元收盤、比上週末軋小二十六元、全日有一百—元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤高—餘元、收進减低卅　、現標金照　牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、上午十一時一刻掛低十兀、以後不更、計大同行懸五百八十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣都落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、漲而復跌、英美余鎊、因亦各降五角、英金票絕鮮買賣、市價呆定如故、美金票步趨低落、傍　略回、晚市爲十六兀五角八分、比上週六終降一　　分、香港票始曾高至叫兀、卒又退爲三元九角八分原價、日金票及朝鮮票趨勢甚軟、前者退至一元五角二分、後者降爲一元一角六分、</p>
<h3>貼現低至四元半</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票　貼現率、仍在步低中、每千兀貼出退至四元半、貼進僅三元半、比上週六又小五角、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均掛七分、軋升一分，</p>
<h3>證劵　內債市場　偏於做多</h3>
<p>證券暗盤昨日市况上午一跌、下午突又劇漲、蓋市上又揑造無根據之和平空氣、以致下午忽又上漲甚勁、可見市塲人心、偏於做多、利多謠言縱屬毫無根據、而漲風必起、利空謠言、雖屬關係甚鉅、而市價反不感休戚、可見市塲大多數均係做多者、昨日市價、丙種又達一元五角、仍未能穿出、上午小到一元七角、而以最小價收盤、買進方面乃投機交易居多、除同康一貫宗旨、始終不斷賣出、順昌多頭出籠、餘亦不過進出頻繁、零牟拋賣而已、結果市價漲三四五角不等、成交的計一百八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股百股、價爲四十二十七角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市開盤、平穩而堅、但價格上漲時、不時有獲利了結鋼　股情形特殊、因宣佈中期股息二元、一度曾見三十四兀七五高價、是項股息多少、令人感覺失望、市况入後略有反動、惟其潛勢仍佳、橡皮股亦堅穩、</p>
<h3>美靈登派中期息</h3>
<p>美靈登有限公司、定於十一月二日開派一九四〇年份中期股息、週年五厘、</p>
<h3>紗花　謠言突起　棉紗不乏放空　雙馬漲後仍跌</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼跌、　實際銷路尚稱良好、香　幫採辦仍有一千餘包、然市塲上一般金子幫、完全根據匯票緊硬而做伸縮、所以美匯稍形回長、即刻不問一切而拋出、市盤乃受其壓迫、但同業心思大都堅昂、此因存底日趨减削之故耳、二十支雙馬高峰會見一千二百七十五元、低價達一千二百三十九元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日堅挺之氣、買風殊熾、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千二百七十元、漲至一千二百七十五元、旋以獲利奢出檔、回挫至一千二百六十五兀、外滙開出依然寗靜、又升至一千二百六十八兀、在此六十元外迴旋多時、繼後聞金價下落、外匯略長、人心忽見虛軟、金子幫紛紛放出、和平空氣、謠諑朋興、市盤乃逐步降下至一千二百四十元、一般拋放隔夜空額者甚多、所以市况更受影響也、查半日間成交統計七千五百八十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港一、〇八〇同行六、五〇〇統計七、五八〇</p>
<p>午後消息、初則形勢仍軟、旋聞匯票帶軟、人心較上午爲振、</p>
<h3>滬埠存棉不豊　棉商不願賤售</h3>
<p>現棉情形依然安靜、但廠方交易仍冷靜、大衆多抱觀望態度、惟行情小克鬆懈、火　草包價爲二百〇八元至〇六元半、彭家浦價爲一百六十叫元半、平果爾價爲一百七十五元、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、　約棉市、　日較形軟弱、後因華爾街股票價格之低落、結果收盤價格、較之上日降五六磅音、印度市况平平、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來仍屬靜寂異常、各方始終抱觀望態度、廠方購意淡薄、同業則仍抱市上存底不豊之主旨、不願鬆動　售價也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉市街銷頻繁　同業逢廉有收進</h3>
<p>廠布昨市平穩、人氣堅實、本街實銷　暢、成交最繁、內地批發白布包亦有巨量裝出、向業客帮逢廉、仍有搜進、囤戶呈觀望態度、粗細布·色布。漂布售盤多數平定、小額手貨每疋廉二角半之譜、本街成交絨布·坯布·粗細布·漂染布現貨及十一十二月份期貨一千數白件、浙閩帮辦色布·粗布等一百餘件、粵港帮辦粗布·斜紋·漂染布·百餘件、</p>
<p>東布市　呈盤旋局勢、龍頭細布晨開卅五元八角、嗣以紗價見跌、散戶拋賣、故一度降至卅五元四角、但同業人心仍堅、後市又趨上騰、收盤卅五元七角半、與上週末無變動、中檔彩球等牌因有實銷需耍、提漲每疋一角半、四君子嗶嘰亦以根子較緊、漲二厘半、收盤價爲一元〇九分半、</p>
<h3>運輸無路　麥爾登實銷大呆</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢交易、本街允殷、南京幫現因查揖嚴緊、轉運公司亦一律不肯負責收裝、其他客幫亦始終未能運輸採辦、以致近來批發交易見遜、完全獨靠本街一隅、麥爾登呢實銷呆滯、　客幫有需要而無運輸之路、本街銷用、均嫌其售價昂貴、大批號衣皆指定十元不到之國產制服呢、大衣裁用則嫌太薄、交易比往年减少一大半、而售盤並不見跌、頭號元藏麥爾登每碼售十五元半、二號十四元半、三號十三元七角半、</p>
<h3>油餅　生油補空轉漲</h3>
<p>昨日花生油市面、因來　减少、現貨底積减少、期貨籌碼不多、市塲中交易大都踢皮球賣買、致以一部份空頭在抵補、多頭壁壘、賡見固守、市價轉漲、結果比上週末、激升一元半、互油依然平平如故、統巾做開膠州生油四百件、（價詳市價欄）靑島生油二百桶、十一月下四百桶（價爲一百另四元二角半至一百另五元）、十二月下交二千桶、（價爲一百另五元七角半至一百另六元七角半）、烟台生油五十件、膠州豆油一百三十件、靑歧豆油四十件、烟台豆油三十五件、大連豆油　桶、靑島豆油三十桶、及大有廠豆油一百担云、</p>
<h3>蔴油奧銷清淡</h3>
<p>本市小車蔴油去路、素以汕頭專廣幫等銷塲爲大宗、蓋兩廣同胞、講究烹調、菜餚喜用蔴油、本市經營蔴油奢、都　蚌埠一帶販運而來、近日蔴油市面、因廣幫客商辦胃沉寂、市價從每白斤（司碼秤）一百十五六元、逐步跌落到一百〇七八元、蚌埠產價亦從七十餘元（天平秤）回降到六十五六元、滬地蚌客來貨、先後有千餘担、故市面不轉好回、不槪耍看廣幫客商的納胃如何而定、（駒）</p>
<h3>糖市　車白堅挺</h3>
<p>昨糖市交易雖屬無多、趣勢尚稱穩定、公會劃盤現貨一四粗白外棧貨七十三元、升五角、荷赤現貨五十六元六角半至五角、升二角半至一角、太古車白Ｂ嘜西棧七十五元一角、升三角、東棧七十五元至七十四元八角、升八角、ＤＹ西棧六十九元半、升五角、ＨＸ嘜六十九元二角、</p>
<h3>煤炭　同得利白煤</h3>
<p>走銷大暢…囤塌謝絕火爐白煤、前因越南形勢變化、斤月中來源斷檔、各經理行家、關住不售、以致行囤居奇、暗盤迭俏、日前經理同得利白煤之丙興煤業公司有鑒於斯，爲安定人心、對於正式同業、公開發售、計開同得利一二三號塊每噸二百三十元、特塊一百廿八元、灰子一百七十元、對於囤戶棧單、一概謝絕云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大片圓肉　續到少數</h3>
<p>大片圓肉、出新以來、到貨雖屬不多、但僅恃本街需要、銷路較狹、故市勢轉軟前後降度已達三四十元、查昨日略有續到、爲數更少、兼之鼓嶼新增特費、或有轉硬之象、</p>
<h3>藥材　山甲片乏到　售價回升一二十元</h3>
<p>山甲片前市輕鬆之後、近日來源、竟乏續到、而號貨業已告判、價乃轉企、疲而復振、前後回升一二十元、山甲皮平平、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼回鬆</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條、近日市面步趨下游、內客帮去路早吿斷絕，而本街銷路又屬呆木、故市　岑寂、人心萎靡、昨喊價每噸如三四分沽一千一百兀、五分至一寸售一千零五十元左右、均比前回鬆達數十元光景、</p>
<h3>平白鐵仍昂</h3>
<p>平白鐵交易依然熱鬧、本埠存貨日竭、因此同業人心異常　勃、標準依然高昂、刻七尺九元五角、六尺八元二角半、</p>
<h3>銀錢業星期六休假的不當　張孟昭</h3>
<p>銀錢業從業員，較任何工二商機關裏的職員，待遇優越得多；（尤其是銀行從業員，有巨大津貼，或米貼，煤貼，房貼等，却從存戶的减息上來增厚行員給養，「見壽君文，」）他們有規定的辦公時間，（上午九時起至下午四時止，）每天的工作鑛點，僅僅七小時弱！（因爲午餐後，叉略休息，故實際工作，恐不足七小時，）辦事淸閑，輕鬆；偶爾顧容擁擠，亦不過忙碌在一剎那間。逢星期停公，逢紀念日休假，行員等人的生活，眞所謂…優哉游哉，得其所哉！論　…權利，義務，是相對的，做多少專，得多少酬報。然而在中國工商界的現象，眞中了俗語所說的：「吃力勿賺錢，賺錢勿吃力」呢！做經理的簽簽字，做主任的動動嘴，忙碌多做的，倒是下級職員，這也尚在其决，還有的擔任了什麼顧問或董事名義，按月拿拿車馬費，領領乾薪，只要有大力奢做背景，拿錢不做事，司空見慣，這是中國工商界的普遍病象。現在「銀錢業又有一種獨優獨樂的舉動了，將於明年（三十年）一月一日起，每逢星期六的下半天，一律休假，這是如何有礙顧客便利，影響工商業務的一件損人利已而自私的辦法。筆奢站在顧客的立塲上，認爲誰都知道大多數的工廠商號，在星期六下午的業務上，和銀錢彙往來的收解，並不减於星期一·二·三·四·五·等日，有的因星期六營業特盛，在時間上的解軟，付款，萬萬來不及，儘在星期六的上半天辦竣，這是一個鐵的事實。又誰都知道，星期六的下午，是一個聲·色·犬·罵·荒淫·逸樂的日子，什麼跑馬·回力球·打彈子·賭博·開旅館·跳舞·電影·戲劇·酒樓·豪宴等……的上海病，充分展開荒唐的塲面。正因星期六下午休假之舉，而反驅使銀錢業從業員羣，踏上荒淫。邪侈·驕奢·逸樂之途，這對於銀錢業本身上，也很有密切不利的鬆響。有的說，銀行界星期日下午停業，這是洋銀行實行於先，當時有所謂外灘銀行的中國銀行界，也因爲加入洋商銀行公會的緣故，照樣停業：可是後來爲了營業競爭，設立了不少分支行，遂亦與共他華商銀行一般是星期六下午照常營業，如今不過一般華銀行仿行罷了，何必大驚小怪，忽來反對呢！你如果有款項要收解，你儘可於銀錢業營業時間來料理，銀錢業決不能爲你們工商界的便利，多犧牲目己的享樂，而且多半日休假，少半日風險，在銀錢業何樂而不爲。你只會向華商銀行發話，大可不必。其實亦不盡然，一則洋商洋行究竟與中國工商業直接之關係淺，何况洋行也有不少於星期六下午停業的，彼此皆有此習慣，原是兩不相傷。可是換一面說，叉焉知不爲洋銀行星期六下午停業，款項收解不便，而洋行也逐漸出於停業哩！上海自從銀行於星期日停業，漸有不少錢業與銀行有往來關係，亦同樣停業。獨不念早年工商界中，星期日停市，只有幾家交易所，現在如米業等也照樣於星期停市了，此在錢業極盛時代，銀行初開辦時候，可有這種情形麼？不要說以前，卽是早幾年，銀行界爲爭攬生意，讓所謂注重「儲蓄」的分支行，星期日半日還是照樣營業呢？大的道幾年銀錢業的財發足了，存款也擁擠了，再用不着什麼競爭。所以行員中有少數不知大體，「眼睛生在額角頭」的，寬不知銀錢業的營業從何而來，反用一副銅靑面孔，大校大樣來對付顧客了，眞正是夜郞自大，可笑亦復可憐。意不想金融爲百業之母，金融一停頓，各業都要受影響，遂有被迫而亦出於停業了。爲了連帶停　的影響，這其間，時間，金錢的損失，冥冥中又不知有多少。眞想不到，銀錢業只會貪圖一已的享樂，而忘却扶助工商業的大賣仟。在這抗建時代，正是各業埋頭苦幹時候；「一月四十五日，」尚覺不够。而銀錢業的從業員偏偏於此緊耍關頭，不出來提倡多做工作，反用盡心思於增加休息日期，是獨何心！</p>

<p>兩租界當局爲使安全運動得普遍注意起見、昨日各通衢要道、及十字路口、張懸捐贈之醒目白布標語、計公共租界七處、內容爲「安全第一」四字、法租界十處、上書「十字路口穿過向左右看淸」「勿任兒童在馬路遊戲」等、頗爲行人注意、此外全市私人汽車。公共汽車。電車。人力車。及小車等、昨均自動張貼三角小旗、重要馬路之牆壁及商店櫥窗、亦均貼有精警圖畫及標語、擴大宣傳、</p>
<p>十字街頭派警指導</p>
<p>十字路爲發生意外最多之處、兩租界警務處、爲此於昨日特調遣全體警捕增駐界內各交叉路口、每處由二名至六名、幫助原有崗捕、指揮交通、並使行人除開放綠燈時必須沿行人錢前進外、不得仟意穿越馬路、因之各馬路口秩序良好、危機頓减、至各十字路口之行人通過綫、及車輛「停止」符號、因年久消失者頗多、昨晨工務處特派工匠、至各路口重行塗劃、故益增注目、</p>

<p>首屆推行已收宏效</p>
<p>據工部局警務處之車務處負責人姚家焜君談、兩租界中居民甚多、且街上車輛、來往頻繁、故闖禍之事、屢有所聞、前年道路意外案有一五八一三件、計死一二三人、傷四九五三人、去年六月乃推行第一屆安全運動、結果肇禍案减少至一三八九二件、計死者二二七人、傷叫九三七人、原定今年六月再與法警務當局合作、二度推行、但因時局張弛不定、遂稽延至今、預料此次成績、較前决更爲優良、</p>
<p>行人十誡切宜遵守</p>
<p>行人應注意之規則如下、（一）行路時必須走在街沿上、（二）勿在路口、穿過馬路、須在人行道處穿過馬路、（三）避免在街沿石上與車輛同一方向行走、（四）在街沿石上行走、須靠左面、（五）須一直通過馬路、不可斜穿、（六）在車輛前後穿出、須特別當心、（七）不可停滯路上、（八）不司叫喚馬路對面之人力車、（九）若無行人道處、須左右看淸、然後穿過馬路（十）在橫馬路車輛將駛來之時、不可衝過馬路、</p>

<h3>霍華德氏來滬　發表印度政情剖析（上）</h3>
<p>前上海字林西報編輯霍華德Edwin　Haward君，現任印度事務顧問，近由印度考察來滬，發表「印度政情之剖析」一文，茲錄其原文如决：</p>
<p>中國一般輿論，對於印度民衆之政見，每表同情，此乃必然之事，誠以中國人民，久以廢除不平等條的爲職志，故對於獨立奮鬥，以及袪除外力枷鎖等事，皆覺易於動聽。當印度國民黨拒絕與英政府合作時，此間中國人士，均發同悄之呼聲。殊不知印度問題，決不若德人以及反英宣傳奢所設想之簡單，吾則英國對於下議院所通過之政策，必覺難於置辯。按之事實，印度之政治情形，殊爲複雜，一般輿論界之誤解，蓋皆由於認識不淸耳。茲以印度之政情，作一簡略之分析。</p>
<p>溯自一九三七年選舉以後，英印之十一州中，屬於印度最大而組織最嚴密之國民黨者，計佔其八。此一政黨，雖無制定憲法之機構，但經其執行機關全印國大委員會之通過，有權表示對於外交上之意見。該黨領袖，對於法西斯及納粹之獨裁者，反對頗力。猶憶英政府未能充分援助阿比西尼亞時，彼等即發指責之詞。對於英國政府，彼等更要求其採取援華作戰之積極政策。而英政府對於西班牙之態度，彼等亦引爲不滿。然當歐戰爆發之時，國民黨卽分化共力量，反對印度參戰，雖經印度總督苦心商勸，彼等仍唆使各州代表，辭職引退，以示反對之意。所持理由，僅爲印度無自決之能力，以及英國作戰且標，未能使印人滿意而已。多數代表，對於此項諭令，本不熱誠贊成，但格於黨規，勢非强表同意不可。表示反對參戰之八省，爲阿撒母，柏哈，孟買，中部諸州，馬德拉斯，西北邊陲諸州，奧理薩，與聯合州。此外三州，判查布，孟加拉及信德則一致主張助英作戰。常此事發生之初，英政府曾盡力向國民黨撫慰勸勉，目欲擴大總督內閣，以便容納各黨代表之建議，亦曾一度提出，以無結果，製痕遂深，於是國民黨乃揚言以「非暴力中義」之方法，拒絕支持英國作戰，其領導奢即爲甘地。但國民黨雖爲組織最嚴密之政黨，然亦不能視爲印度唯一之政治機構，蓋彼所不能代表者，尚有被壓迫階級五千萬人，卽印度敎徒與回敎徒是。以種種理由，回敎徒對於國民黨之擁護，已漸”减少；其結果，令印回敎徒聯合會，在琴那領導之下，近已公然反對該露。判查布，孟加拉與信德之州長，皆係回敎徒，對於英政府之作戰，自始即予搬護。查印度三萬三千八百萬人民中，二萬三千九百萬爲印度敎徒，七千七百萬爲回敎徒，四百萬爲塞克敎徒。各敎本皆與國民黨合作，但自戰事爆發以後，塞克敎徒即傾向判查布方面，其原因固係由於軍事慣例，而大部分則由於深恐英政府减少彼等服役之人數。判查布州政府之態度，至爲重要，因印度軍隊，百分之六十二爲該州人民。故判查布之回敎徒，實係印度軍隊之骨幹。國民黨此决舉動，使其統治印度之實權，大爲削弱；蓋當作戰期間，中央政府尚有人力財力兩皆充沛之諸州擁護於後，而自由主義者回教徒，被脅迫階級以及塞克教徒，目前已補與國民黨合作。同敎徒聯合會於國民黨之執拗舉動中躍居　要地位，印度敎方面　之亦頗爲驚奇。印度商人，本皆同情國民黨之計劃，但以印度戰時工業之發展，已使彼等轉而反對國民黨之乖異主張。然英政府所不能忽視者，厥爲曠日持久以後，國民黨仍將於印度政界中估重要地位，而該黨之拒絕與總督合作，固未始非一莫大之汚點也。</p>
<h3>工部局力求撙節　修改雇員條件　特組一委員會從事研究　將取消請假等優待辦法</h3>
<p>頃悉工部局已特設小組委員會、研究修改工部局聘僱職員之條件、俾來年預算、續求撙節、該局副總辦納許、昨晨（十八日）證實此小組委員會業已成立、惟稱非待該會向工部局提出報吿、則不能披露此事詳情」</p>
<p>小組委會將提建議</p>
<p>查該小組委員會係退出公共租界之各國納稅人組成主席鮑音登牧師、秘書爲工部局助理總辦雷桑、委員有賈里歐·鮑威爾．R．ToyoKawa，陳君D．S．Chen與鐵林南齊五人、官方迄今僅披露該新委員會之各稱爲一工部局特別撙節委員會服務條件小組委員會、聞該會或將於本月下旬提出初步報吿書、至於該會或將建議何種修改、工部局官員拒不置評、」</p>
<p>規定薪額取消優待</p>
<p>惟若干人士測猜工部局聘僱職員之條件、明年將全加修改、且信該會將請工部局規定一切職員現有薪金範圍之標準、庶在原則上取銷現有之請假等優待辦法、一說小組委員會未必能獲改善工部局經濟狀况之任何有價值決議、因取銷優待職員之辦法、將影響全局、而使許多職員辭職也、</p>

<h3>「被侮辱與被損害的」</h3>
<p>— 麗芳</p>
<p>在這個社會裹，做女人眞不容易，到處碰到麻煩和苦惱。你也許以爲：只要不結婚，總不至於會有多大的不幸吧？但誰說的呢？拿我說吧，我就是一個沒有結婚的二十歲的女孩子。父親和母親都是受過良好敎育的，一切都讓我自由，尊重我的意見，家裹充滿了和穆，平靜的空氣。我長得還算漂亮，男孩子都向我投着羨慕的含着好意的眼光；自然，這看起來，我該是快活而幸福的人了；但是不，全不是這麼回事，我有我的苦惱。單拿走路說，就遭到許多災難，雖說這苦惱是細微的，但已經滿够受用的了。</p>
<p>我是一個『被侮辱與被損害的』人。請看我的訴苦狀吧。</p>
<p>在我讀中學的時候，我才十七歲。有一回我在等電車，有一輛裝泥塊的大卡車駛過，上面站滿了工人，這當然沒有什麼可驚異的，但厄運來了。忽然有一大團泥擲在我的頭上，肩上和身上，接着是一陣粗野的笑聲。卡車把笑聲帶遠了，祇留下被侮辱了的我。是的，我明白的：一切的不幸—更難忍受的不幸都向着我圍上來了，只爲了我已是一個長成的漂亮的少女的緣故。</p>
<p>以後我隨時都警戒着，防衛着我自己，但我還是不斷地接受到苦惱。</p>
<p>有時候走過一家店舖，會有一口濃厚的痰飛鏢似的飛過來，有時叶『鏢』朋友『吐走了眼』—不中，這算是幸運；有時被吐在衣裳上，濺在臉上；你向那櫃臺上看看，有時那英雄已溜開了，有時却仍安詳地毫不在意地冷冷地爬在櫃臺上，好似說：『你怎樣呢？我吐痰吐不得嗎？』有時還會得意地說：啊！大小姐，對不起，衣裳弄『齷齪』哉，阿要我替儂汰？』如果走過的是賣舊衣裳的店，那花樣可更新鮮，店員會把一條褲子抖起來，抖在你的頭上，喊着說：『哎，兩塊兩角八，兩條小辮于（如果你頭上梳着兩條小辮子的話。），一隻大姐姐……』嚇，你要辦交涉嗎？那還楚算了吧，你只有受到更大的侮辱。</p>
<p>這沒完，多着呢！這種悄形，在夏季穿單衣裳的時候發牛得最多。有時，你走得好好的，會有一隻手在你裸露着的手臂上摸一把，捏一把，或奢擰一把。自然，我只說熱天容易遇到這種情形，並不是說冬天絕沒有這種事；手臂是裏上衣裳了，但在你胸部來一下，不也一樣嗎？扮這種英雄的，各色人等都有，但最多的都是穿着雪亮的尖頭皮鞋，頭髮又亮又光的學生階級的人物。自然，這說來似乎太不給靑年學生面子，但怎麼辦呢，我說的是實話呀！我就是常常看見了亮閃閃的尖頭皮鞋老遠的在移過來，就趕快避開的一個。</p>
<p>嚇人的事還有呢，有時正走着，一隻有力的手抓在你的肩上，回頭一看，是個又高又大，臉上墨黑，生着一嘴白牙的印度阿三的臉，使你又怕又驚又着惱。</p>
<p>我是一個『被侮辱與被損害的』人，但我知道這是敎育問題，這是這個社會制度下特有的必然的現象，我知道我所受的侮辱還不是最大的侮辱，可是我不悲哀，我不畏懼，我有勇氣抗爭，我要親自參加這個社會的葬禮。</p>
<h3>上天有路，入地無門。</h3>
<p>— 馬戈作</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>「我走釗大同路時，忽見李芝範剛從大同路的北面迎面過來。他的後向還跟着兩個人。我以爲很巧，正想穿過了靑蒲路去招呼他。不料正在這個當兒，我瞧見他後面的兩個人，忽而竄前來攔阻他，好像要向他要索什麼。三個人就扭做一團。接着，砰砰兩聲槍響，李芝範便倒在大同路的轉角。那兩個人也就回身向大同路的北端飛奔。我想不到有這個意外的岔子，也就旋轉身子，向大同路　端退回去。我不曾料到你已派便衣探員在那裹監守着。我爲連愼起見，又繞了幾個圈千，才回到黃河路去。不料那個瘦子非常機警，我一路上曾好幾决回頭，還曾見他的影踪。不過這個人對於我扣有用處。如果在這件事上，你對於我有什麼懷疑，我想他可以給我做一個證人。」</p>
<p>我暗忖李芝範的被人襲擊，他果眞完全沒有關係嗎？他的話如果不虛，這件事還有相當的麻煩。打李芝範的是誰？據趙伯雄說，另外有兩個人。這兩個是什麼樣人？眼前我們還沒有頭緒啊。</p>
<p>霍桑沉着臉說道：「趙伯雄，這一回事，你在法律的立塲上，應有相當處分。不過這女子是一個社會的害物，國家的罪人，若就你的職務上說，那當然應富別論。不過就說你的職務，你的行動失檢，也不能不受相當的處分。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄又立起身來，恭恭敬敬地鞠了一個躬，低聲說：「霍先生，你的訓話我都領受。我自己也知道我的錯誤。現在你給我仟何處分，我都準備接受。」</p>
<p>霍桑也站起身來，把玩在手中的那把小刀向書桌上一丟，隨意地說：「處分的權不在我的手裏。這是我的見解，又是我對於你的一個警吿。你去罷，你應有怎樣的處分，我想你不久自然會知道。」（一七〇）</p>

<h3>重聚</h3>
<p>— 瑩金</p>
<p>我們難得有這樣的聚集。</p>
<p>從學校里出來，我們先後被推入社會之門，可是空間阻隔着我們，使我們很少有碰面的機緣，有幾位舊同學就一直不曾見面過。</p>
<p>今天我們却意外地重叉聚在一起。當我接得粹錦的電話，叫我參加這個聚集的時候，我楚懷着一顆多麼激動多麼興奮的心情呵！腦子里不斷地浮現着那幾位舊同學的面影，記憶之膜重又映上了昔日我們之間的一些有趣味的事情，……</p>
<p>終於，我們在一間幽靜的屋子里會見了。很少客套，就在這樣適宜的環境中展開了熱烈的談笑，誰都那麼毫無顧忌地傾吐着自己的心胸，卽使從前在學校里有過爭執的，現在也像忘了似的反顯得分外親密了。</p>
<p>談笑中，我審視着那些舊同學的面部的輪廓，却瞧不出有什麼大的變化！但從他們底談吐，舉止，及對於自己在這個動態的大時代里所經歷的一切事故的批判，我敏感地覺得他們底思想的進展的神速。</p>
<p>就像是預先的好了才說似的，他們討厭七海：討厭那些高等華人的驕奢淫佚的生活，操縱剝削的行爲，討厭那晚上「罪惡的癥結」的腥紅的天慕，也討厭那專爲有錢人着想的一切物質上的設施，……</p>
<p>這些也都是我自己所感受到而卅常發之於口的今天從那些舊同學的口里發出來，就覺得分外的親切。這幾年並不不是一個很長的時間，然而過去在學校里的單純的頭腦現在却都有了這麼深刻的認識了！</p>
<p>——社會是一個很大的學校，每個人所經歷的事故小就是很好的活的課本嗎？</p>
<p>如果把我平日的生活喻爲喝白開水，那末我今天喝了一杯濃郁的咖啡了。</p>

<h3>本年度的　影城五大導演錄</h3>
<p>— 賀拉</p>
<p>好萊塢的「電影快報」最近曾舉行本年度最佳五導演之讀奢智力測騐，按該刊係新近創辦但在美國學生界中擁有巨大銷數，故此决測騐之水準極爲提高，因不僅須視導演之藝術價值，並須根據其平素之人格及思想修養。該刊揭曉一九四〇年之五大最佳導演名單如下：</p>
<p>（一）威廉·台德勒（Wm．Dieterle），作品如「仲夏夜之夢」，「血雨腥風」，「左拉傳」，「錦繡山河」，「鐘樓怪人」，「萬古流芳」，「鐵面人」。</p>
<p>（二）的翰·福特（John　Ford），作品如「革命叛徒」，「關山飛渡」，「少年林肯，」「水火島」，「怒火之花」，「新金山」等。</p>
<p>（三）佛萊克·卡潑拉（Frank　Capra），作品如「桃源豔跡」，「富貴浮雲」，「浮生若夢」，「民主萬歲」等。</p>
<p>（四）米格·寇蒂滋（Michael　Curtiz），作品如「羅賓漢」，「四千金」，「新四千金」，「一世之雄」，「熱血男兒」等。</p>
<p>（五）愛德門。高亭（Edmund　Goulding）作品如「卿何薄命」，「人海寃魂」，「天上人間」，「長相思」等。</p>
<p>前三個導演的思想是很　步的，他們不滿意於現在的社會制度或同情於被壓迫的人們，或諷刺無恥的行爲，觀衆對於他們三個的影響是挺大的了。至於寇蒂滋那也是著名的一個大導演，以輕快而父深刻的作風見長。最後那個導演眞是無人不曉的以哀情凄豔的手法稱雄於好萊塢影壇上的。</p>
<h3>紀葉氏昆仲之演藝</h3>
<p>— 病鸠</p>
<p>故都富連成社校友隊，應聘黃金，業已到滬，以葉氏三昆仲爲主體，輔以閻世善艾世菊及留滬之袁世海茹富蘭等，陣容相當整齊，葉氏三兄弟，卽葉盛章葉盛蘭及葉世長，盛蘭來滬已多决，爲滬人所習知，盛章世長，則多不詳其所工與經歷，爰爲介紹如决：</p>
<p>葉盛章爲已故富連成社長葉善春之第三子，亦今日富社之台柱也。善春治家素嚴盛章幼入伶籍，其父不以之進手創之富連成社，而送入朱幼芬之福淸社科班，蓋恐其驕矜也，時科班待子弟極嚴，稍犯班規，卽施鞭撻。盛章入科後，習武花，以營養不調，心力兩疲，爲師長所不滿，時遭夏楚，日久乃形瘦骨消，奄然病倒，富社外館沈秀水，見而憫之，爲之延醫診治，未幾病愈，沈復向善春說項，使之入富社，專工武丑，藝乃大成。初决公演「雁翎甲，於哈飛爾，極受觀衆歡迎，論奢且譽爲王（長林）傳（小山）之後第一人。善春卒獨力撑富社，直至於今，彼之拿手戲，爲三盜一偷，三盜即「時遷盜甲」「朱光祖盜鈎」「楊香武盜杯」；一偷卽一時遷偷雞」武丑老輩如王長林傳小山先後謝世，三盜一偷能勝任愉快者，僅盛章一人而已。且葉正在中年，精神飽滿，柔軟輕靈之種種武工，無不兼具，惜念白口齒，微近傳小山，不能得老辣爽利之致，爲美中不足耳。</p>
<p>葉盛蘭行四，工文武小生，拿手戲如「奇雙會」「岳家莊」「白門樓」「射戟」「羣火會」「雅觀樓」「探莊」「夜奔」　都具工力，滬人觀之數，已有定評，此决南來，擬間串花旦戲，蓋其本工也。余意若以之演「英杰烈」「花木蘭」「虹霓關」等劇成績必在一般花旦之上。</p>
<p>葉世長爲盛章盛蘭之弟，亦富社學生，性聰慧，善春在日，最愛此子，唱老生，嗓音扮相，兩皆不弱，現已卒業，能戲數十齣，工力與前隸更新之遲世恭相彷彿，而嗓音高亮則過之。在科時曾一度倒嗆，幸不久卽規復，民國廿五年北平立言報舉行童伶選舉，世長以四二六六票膺首席，時人之推重如此，其藝　可想見矣。</p>
<h3>女藝人羣像</h3>
<p>— 唐想</p>
<p>（五）陳琦</p>
<p>陳琦正與孫景瑯一樣，同是由話劇舞臺躍登銀慕的，現在她是合衆影業公司的基本演員，同時也是新藝劇社的一份子。名劇作家魏如晦，是最賞識陳琦的一個；在魏如晦的提掖之下，使她在藝壇上像野玫瑰似的絢爛地搖曳着。</p>
<p>今年，她還祗是一個十七歲的小姑娘，她的原名是翠棣，曾肄業於中法戲劇學校，爲中法劇社基　隊伍之一，曾在「阿Ｑ」中飾七斤嫂，又曾兼代吳媽一角，而以主演許幸之導演的獨幕劇「小英雄」成名。她從事於話劇工作已有並不短暫的歷史，所以她的舞臺經騐也相富豐富。之後，她父曾加入上海劇藝社，在「明末遺恨」（即「葛嫩娘」）中演美娘一角，博得了更普遍的好評，她的加入合衆影業公司，也就在這個時候，處女作是「香妃」，飾蘭兒一角，介紹她進合衆的就是魏如晦。</p>
<p>現在，合衆正攝賽金花」一片，陳琦也參加演出，飾珊兒一角。「賽金花的劇本是朱石麟所編，而村料則由魏如晦供給，魏初意要使陳琦擔任兩個個性不同的角色，但朱石麟在考慮之下是沒有接受遭個意見，並將魏所貢獻的一部份材料刪節了，於是陳琦祇担仟了珊兒一個角色。</p>
<p>不久以前，新藝劇社在璇宮劇院上演「海國英雄」，以陳琦飾鄭成功之女鄭瑜，雖然僅有一塲戲，她却演一塲哭一塲，許多的觀衆也陪着她下淚，這證明了她是一個豐於情感的女藝人。我會有如下的一首詩讚美她：「自是蛾眉稟賦奇，銀箏按罷淚如縻；年來着遍傷離筆，不及歌臺一女兒。」就是看了她在「海國英雄」裏的演出以後所寫的。</p>
<p>但是在「私底下」她却又是個頑皮的孩子，她愛說笑，愛調藝人家，對於任何事都大膽而潑辣，與她在舞臺上所顯現的個性絕對相反。所以將野玫瑰和她比擬是最恰當的，她是又嬌豔而又多刺的一朶藝壇之花呢。（明日記英茵）</p>

        <h1>1940.11.19</h1>
<h3>Report of Thailand's Cooperation with Britain and America, Efforts to Safeguard Common Interests, Significant Understanding Reached on Concluding a Military Agreement, Japan Expresses Extreme Concern Upon Receiving Report</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to a Bangkok dispatch published here, Thailand, Britain, and America have apparently reached an understanding on concluding a secret military agreement, the contents of which consist of the following six points: (1) Thailand will cooperate with Britain and America to strive to safeguard common interests; (2) Britain and America will provide assistance to Thailand's demands for the return of lost territories (currently annexed to Vietnam); (3) Britain and America will, in principle, recognize the independence of Thailand; (4) Britain and America will provide military assistance in the event that Thailand is attacked; (5) The United States will agree to lend large sums of money and supply military goods to Thailand, including aircraft, munitions, bullets, gasoline, and technical personnel; (6) Thailand will cooperate closely with the Chinese within its borders (Reuter's, 18th).</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today prominently published information from Bangkok, stating that Britain and America have concluded a secret military agreement with Thailand. The newspaper stated that the Japanese government is greatly concerned about this news. "Asahi Shimbun" reported that British and American officials had earlier made suggestions to Thailand. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no official reports regarding the alleged British, American, and Thai activities, but it had already received suggestions from Britain and America. The newspaper pointed out that Japan and Thailand concluded a trade treaty in 1937 and established a friendly agreement in June 1940. Japan is currently planning to convert the Japanese legation in Bangkok into an embassy. The newspaper stated, "From the viewpoint of establishing a shared East Asian prosperity sphere, Japan cannot ignore the secret activities of Britain and America in Thailand." "Asahi Shimbun" claimed that Britain and America threatened Thailand with forceful measures if Thailand refused to sign the treaty. These threatening measures reportedly included refusing to assist Thailand's movement to recover lost territories from Vietnam, halting all economic assistance and the supply of coal, munitions, and other goods, and disrupting Thailand's financial circles. The newspaper continued that if Thailand abandons its current neutral stance, Britain and America threaten to recognize it as a belligerent state and impose an economic blockade on Thailand. "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported from Bangkok that Britain and America are offering Thailand a military agreement, with the prevention of Japan's southward advance as the "bait" for its acceptance. "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported that if this news is true, the Japanese government will take stern action against Britain and America. The newspaper stated that the purpose of Britain and America's move is to interfere with Japan's process of establishing a Greater East Asia, and therefore their stern action is appropriate. The Japanese government will also strongly warn Thailand that a military alliance with Britain and America not only violates the pledge of harmony with Japan but is also Thailand's own "suicidal act." One newspaper expressed disbelief in the rumors of a British, American, and Thai agreement, stating that it hopes Thailand will seek stronger cooperation with Japan (United Press, 18th).</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today acknowledged that officials have received rumors that Britain and America will conclude a defense agreement with Thailand and stated that the authorities are quite concerned about these rumors because rumors often become facts. Newspapers here are now using these rumors to warn Thailand not to become an enemy of Japan (Reuter's, 18th).</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao Recovered from Illness</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to a telegram received here, Dai Jitao, who fell ill in Calcutta, has now recovered and will leave India within days to travel to the Nanyang region (Reuter's, 18th).</p>
<h3>Japan Makes Another Peace Attempt, Claims Will Negotiate Directly with Chairman Chiang, Advises the US Not to Take Any Action in the Near Future</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding the reported decision by the Japanese Imperial Conference that Japan will seek to negotiate peace directly with General Chiang Kai-shek, official sources here declared that they have heard nothing about this rumor (Reuter's, 18th).</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to reliable sources reported today, the Japanese government will seek to negotiate peace directly with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At the Imperial Conference last Wednesday, it was resolved that Japan should make a "final attempt" to deal with the Chongqing National Government. Unless Chairman Chiang changes his attitude toward Japan within a "reasonable period," Japan will retaliate by formally recognizing the Wang Jingwei "government" in Nanjing. The Japanese side claims that if the Chongqing National Government ultimately does not accept the "Japanese peace terms," Japan will be forced to recognize the "Nanjing government" and will no longer deal with the Chongqing National Government. The decision of the Imperial Conference has also been communicated to the Wang Jingwei side. Reportedly, Wang also strongly supports the Japanese government's plan for direct peace negotiations. According to reliable reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka has already notified US Ambassador Grew that he will seek direct negotiations with Chairman Chiang to seek peace and requested the US government not to take any action in the Pacific that might hinder Japan's efforts for peace or encourage Chongqing to continue resistance. The Japanese army currently stationed in China, which has always supported the "Nanjing organization" and urged the Japanese government to recognize it, has now agreed to give Matsuoka a "final chance for peace." Sources here with inside information are currently silent about the content of Matsuoka's planned peace terms, only saying that they are quite "generous." Some believe that these terms will be the most "generous" ever proposed by Japan. There is no news on how Wang Jingwei and his followers will fare in this peace plan. In general, in addition to seeking the restoration of peace between itself and China, Japan will attempt to reconcile Chiang and Wang (Special Correspondent Tom of the United Press, 18th).</p>
<p>Tokyo - It has been learned that General Abe, who arrived in Tokyo on the 27th of last month, will return to Nanjing in the middle of this week. After Abe's return here, he has been consulting with senior officials regarding the Nanjing negotiations for days. It is reported that Abe, in a final consultation with Prime Minister Konoe yesterday, resolved the necessary arrangements for concluding a treaty with the Nanjing government. According to officials, the recent Imperial Conference discussed the China situation, but it was certainly related to the conclusion of a treaty with the "Nanjing government" (Reuter's, 18th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Infantry and Artillery Units Attack Southern Hubei in Multiple Routes and are Defeated, Japanese Invaders of Xin Yang's Bali Slope Fall into Chinese Encirclement, Chinese and Japanese Armies Engage in Cross-River Artillery Battle at Fenglingdu</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Southern Hubei - More than a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery units, supported by three warships and assisted by aircraft for several consecutive days, launched multiple attacks toward Jia Yu's East and West Liang Lakes. The Chinese army responded calmly and ultimately defeated the Japanese offensive (18th).</p>
<p>Fancheng - On the morning of the 13th, a unit of Japanese troops near Xinyang in southern Henan advanced toward Bali Slope.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Sincerity or Falsehood of Japan's Pursuit of Peace</h3>
<p>An editorial was occasionally written because the Japanese Miyako Shimbun stated that Chongqing should consider peace before Japan officially recognizes the new government in Nanjing. Then, the editorial discussed the issue of war and peace between China and Japan. Now, a telegram from Tokyo has been received, and it is known that these matters did not come from thin air. The Tokyo dispatch states:</p>
<p>It was announced by informed sources that Japanese officials have openly stated that the Japanese government, in order to end the "China Incident," is planning to hold direct talks with the Chongqing Chinese government in order to establish "peace" between China and Japan. It is said that the incident discussed at the Japanese Imperial Conference was this matter, and the conference decided to make a final effort for direct "peace" talks between China and Japan before recognizing the Jiangning "organization." If this effort still fails, the Japanese side will recognize the Jiangning "organization." Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has directly told US Ambassador Grew to Japan that Japan is willing to talk "peace" with General Chiang Kai-shek, and he himself intends to "make contact" with General Chiang in person in order to negotiate this matter. He also requested that the United States not take any action in the Pacific while Japan is making this "peace" effort, so as not to hinder the possibility of negotiations or increase Chinese resistance to Japan. It is also learned that the leaders of the Japanese army in China have also agreed with the Japanese government's decision and are determined to give Matsuoka a final opportunity to carry out the work of "peace" between China and Japan. As for the peace conditions that the Japanese government is willing to propose, the Japanese side has kept them secret, and it has not been disclosed how the so-called "direct negotiations" will be carried out.</p>
<p>If the telegram is not wrong, then the interest it attracts internationally is greater than what was stated in the Miyako Shimbun. It is said that after receiving this news in Washington, US authorities did not comment, but many people believe that this is one of Japan's peace offensives, the purpose of which is to ease the current tension between the United States and Japan and to create a smokescreen for secretly preparing to advance south. They also believe that China has been fighting for more than three years, and its determination to strive for final victory is becoming stronger and stronger, and it will definitely fight to the end and reject this proposal from the Japanese side. How Chongqing will react to these observations in Washington is not yet known.</p>
<p>Ever since violence and fraud have gradually gained prominence in the international arena, international moral concepts have plummeted. Therefore, everything that is suspicious must be suspected of being extremely evil, and everything that may be credible must be believed to be untrue. Just as Czechoslovakia was first sold out in Munich and then dismembered with little ability to move, and just as France accepted the Vietnam Agreement, thinking it was just a pretext to harm China, but it knew not it was opening the door to the thief, bringing disaster upon itself. These are the most prominent victims of violence and fraud. With such obvious examples not far away, who would lightly believe diplomatic rhetoric, especially after repeated losses of credibility, making such contradictory statements? Therefore, we can only wait and see what the results of the statements of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka as reported in the Tokyo dispatch will be. The so-called "peace conditions that the Japanese government is willing to propose are kept secret," and "it has not been disclosed how the so-called direct negotiations will be carried out," truly make it impossible for those who hear them to understand. However, the problem is not in this. The problem of negotiation is not whether it is direct or indirect, and the problem of conditions is only that China wants independence, freedom, and complete territorial sovereignty. These two items seem to be problems, but they are not. In other words, if the conditions proposed by Japan damage China's territorial sovereignty or hinder China's independence and freedom, then there is no need for negotiation at all, and there is no hope for peace at all.</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo dispatch, it is not yet possible to talk about how to negotiate or what conditions to negotiate. Not only that, but we also believe that Japan should have the sincerity to seek peace for the sake of Japan's national destiny. Therefore, we are not surprised by the Japanese authorities' expression of seeking peace. However, the attitude of the Japanese authorities as described in the Tokyo dispatch not only lacks the sincerity of seeking peace but also lacks an understanding of the current problem. If both of these are lacking, then the so-called how to negotiate and what conditions to negotiate are all superfluous questions. Why do we say this? There are two main points: (1) Between China and Japan, over the years, there have indeed been many and major outstanding issues that have not been resolved for a long time. However, the two countries were in a state of peace. When Japan disrupted the state of peace, military and political offensives followed one after another, and China had no choice but to engage in resistance. After more than three years, Japan has proven in fact that various offensives are ineffective and realized the necessity of restoring the state of peace between the two countries. Then, the procedure is to abandon all its various offensives against China. Otherwise, there is no so-called peace negotiation. What may need to be "negotiated" is only how the two sides will properly negotiate in the process of Japan starting to abandon its offensives until it completes the abandonment, in order to obtain China's goodwill cooperation technically and avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Now Japan cannot propose this and still uses the so-called recognition issue, which has nothing to do with the National Government and nothing to do with the facts and the situation of war and peace, to threaten the National Government. This intention is no different from saying that if peace negotiations are ineffective, it will continue its offensive. This is in fact no different from declaring the ineffectiveness of the offensive on one hand and attempting to use the ineffective offensive for blackmail to be effective on the other. How can peace be achieved with such peace negotiations? (2) China is resisting because it has been invaded, and it is resisting to preserve its independence, freedom, and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty. During the period of resistance, it is of course eager to have relations with other countries. Of course, it hopes for foreign aid. Moreover, the objective impact of the resistance has caused some countries other than China to benefit from China's victory in resistance. Therefore, it is only natural for other countries to provide generous aid. Those who lack understanding, or even deliberately distort the facts, believe that China is fighting on behalf of other countries' interests, and that China only fights because of the support of other countries. Fulfilling this distorted view to its fullest extent, they believe that China only fights because other countries encourage it, and that China will not fight if other countries do not provide aid. It can be said that propagandists who make this distorted propaganda only show that their propaganda is clumsy and will ultimately be ineffective. However, if politicians have this distorted understanding, they will lead their country to a wrong path and trap their country in an abyss from which it cannot be pulled out. Their foolishness and fallacy are truly incomprehensible. As the Tokyo dispatch states, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka said to US Ambassador Grew in Japan, "Request the United States not to take any action in the Pacific while Japan is making this peace effort, so as not to hinder the possibility of negotiations or increase Chinese resistance." If this is not Matsuoka's foolishness and fallacy, then it must be Matsuoka's distorted diplomatic rhetoric.</p>
<p>Let's retreat a hundred steps and try to explain it with the most foolish sincerity: Matsuoka's everything, all his rhetoric, has his unavoidable painstaking efforts to protect Japan's face, and his true intention is still to seek peace. Then, future trends will only tend towards two paths: First, Japan will take factual actions and begin to abandon its various offensives to prove its sincerity in seeking peace; Second, China's resistance, the United States' actions in the Pacific, and the rapid and strong assistance of China's other friendly countries will enable Japan to fulfill its sincerity in seeking peace! Only with sincerity can it benefit the overall situation.</p>

<h3>Hunan Province Expands Air Defense Propaganda</h3>
<p>Leiyang - Various places in Hunan Province are currently preparing to commemorate the first Air Defense Festival. The event here is scheduled to be held from the 19th and will simultaneously exhibit air defense military equipment and war trophies, expand propaganda, and hold popular lectures to increase public awareness of air defense.

<h3>Fujian Province Implements Grain Control</h3>
<p>Fuzhou - After the grain in Fujian Province has been subject to unified management and it was decided to ration grain according to the number of people, the Provincial Grain Management Bureau is implementing various preparations. The administrative aspects are uniformly planned by the bureau, and the business aspects of supply and distribution are handled by a separate Public Sale Bureau, which manages the public sale bureaus in various places. Food for the people in Yong'an and Nanping has begun to be generally supplied. Each person uses a household registered purchase certificate to purchase one city catty of rice per day from retail stores approved by the Public Sale Bureau. Each yuan can purchase four city catties and ten liang of rice in Nanping, and four city catties and four liang in Yong'an. The rice prepared according to the number of households in recent days has only been able to sell 70 percent, so there is a surplus of rice every day. Social life, with a sufficient supply of grain, is exceptionally stable, and the prices of other goods have also fallen in conjunction. The rice price stipulated in this item is planned to be reduced month by month in Fujian Province, and Fuzhou is also actively preparing. There are a total of 160 retail rice stores approved for registration in the city (18th).</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Entering Vietnamese Territory are Purely Rumors, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding rumors that Chinese troops have crossed the border in the Yunnan-Vietnam border area, Zheng Jun, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that this is completely intentional fabrication and purely unfounded. In the future, if there are still similar rumors, they should be regarded as malicious propaganda by the Japanese side, and no statement will be made (18th).</p>
<p>Bangkok - It has been learned from here that French aircraft have again violated the border of Thailand. Near Longgai on the Mekong River, about 50 Vietnamese soldiers entered Thai territory and are willing to be dealt with by the Thai authorities. It is said that the infringement of Thai airspace by French aircraft has exceeded dozens of times so far. The Lae Chi La newspaper in Bangkok reported that Thailand is now unable to hold peace talks with France. Thailand is about to use force and no longer cares about the intentions of the Thai government or the Prime Minister, but views the emotions of the people as the decisive factor (Haitong News Agency, 18th).</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the rumors that Chinese troops have crossed the Vietnamese border, people here are very skeptical. A person in charge of the French Colonial Department said last night that if the rumors were true, General Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, would definitely report to Colonial Minister Platon, but the Colonial Department has not received a telegram regarding Chinese troops crossing the Vietnamese border (Haitong News Agency, 18th).</p>

<h3>Greek War Report Claims: All Italian Troops Have Withdrawn from Greek Territory; Italian Troops Suffer Another Defeat on the Eastern Front; Street Fighting Occurs in the Korçë Area</h3>
<p>Athens: Greek official reports state that, with the assistance of British and Greek aircraft, Greek forces yesterday expelled the last Italian troops from Greek territory. Simultaneously, they annihilated an Italian mechanized division that was attempting to flee into Yugoslavia. It is reported that Yugoslav authorities have impounded several Italian armored vehicles near Ohrid. These vehicles were fleeing from the pursuit of Greek forces in the Korçë region and had crossed into Yugoslav territory. It is rumored that Italian troops have abandoned their base in Korçë. The entire city is engulfed in flames, having been heavily shelled by Greek forces to the point of being indefensible. Some of the Greek artillery used was captured from the Italians. In the central sector battles yesterday, it is reported that 700 Italian soldiers were captured, including many officers. Additionally, twelve field guns, four heavy guns, and numerous old machine guns were seized. On Sunday, Greek forces launched another offensive against Italian positions beyond Kalamas, capturing another 100 Italian soldiers, including four officers. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Athens: A Greek authoritative spokesman recently stated that all Italian troops who had invaded Greece have been driven out. Greek forces are now knocking on the door of Korçë, a strategically important town in Albania. The Greek army's ability to invade Albania is truly due to the achievements of the British and Greek air forces, as it was the British air force that forced the Italians to abandon Greek territory. "Our troops are currently engaged in battle with enemy forces at the gates of Korçë," the authoritative spokesman stated. Greek convoys are also still engaged in clearing out the remaining Italian soldiers in the Korçë area. Greek forces have reached Melissopetra and seized a large amount of military supplies left behind by the retreating Italian troops. In Constanta, the Italian troops caused widespread destruction, with half of the buildings in the area being destroyed. The spokesman also accused Italian aircraft of indiscriminately bombing the Ophiliyna area between Korçë and Bilisht, and stated that Greek forces have completed clearing operations in the Kanana area. Accompanying the achievements of the Greek army was the action of the Greek navy on the nights of Thursday and Friday. According to government announcements, a destroyer squadron led by Admiral Kabadiyiannis has passed through the Strait of Otranto, "patrolling the Adriatic Sea as far as Sazan Island, and after completing their mission, returned to base." The official war bulletin continued, "Battles are currently underway on all fronts, with the most intense fighting occurring in the Epirus and Korçë East mountain regions. Captured prisoners, artillery, and military supplies have all fallen into our hands." Strategically important highlands, despite strong enemy resistance and intense aerial attacks, have ultimately been occupied by our forces. Italian aviation carried out extensive bombing of inland cities and villages, and strafed with machine guns, but there were no casualties or significant damage. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Athens: According to war news recently received in Athens, Greek forces on the eastern front have routed an Italian column. It is also rumored that Italian tanks, due to their defeat, retreated into Yugoslav territory to avoid being captured by Greek forces, but this claim has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Reliable information coming from the Yugoslav-Albanian border last night confirms that Greek forces have not yet occupied the city of Korçë in Albania. Previous reports in a certain newspaper in the Yugoslav capital, claiming that the city had been occupied by Greek forces and that Italian troops had retreated into Yugoslav territory to avoid capture, are not consistent with the facts. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Athens: Frontline war reports claim that Greek forces this morning are fighting within the city of Korçë, a major base of the Italian army in Albanian territory, driving out the remnants of the Italian garrison. The military supplies of the annihilated Italian mechanized division have almost entirely been seized by Greek forces. British and Greek air forces, flying low and diving steeply, assisted ground troops in defeating this division defending Korçë, pursuing the fleeing Italian troops all the way to the Yugoslav border. Simultaneously, a large Italian contingent along the Ionian coast has also been encircled. North of Korçë, it is reported that another Italian column has been surrounded by Greek forces and is currently under terrifying Greek artillery fire. Greek vanguards entered Korçë at noon yesterday and engaged in battle with the Italian army's elite rearguard. The capture of Korçë would be Greece's greatest victory in the Italian-Greek war, and would eliminate the threat to the strategically important port of Thessaloniki from Italian forces, and would lead to the Greek army capturing an Italian heartland even before Italian forces had captured any major Greek cities. Rumor has it that some Greek units have advanced deep into Albania, pursuing the defeated Italian troops. Today, the Greek High Command announced that yesterday, twenty-eight Italian aircraft attempted to aid Italian troops besieged on the Ionian coast, but were shot down by Greek anti-aircraft fire and withdrew. Simultaneously, it was also announced that yesterday, the British air force destroyed at least thirty Italian aircraft parked on the ground in Albanian territory. It is claimed that numerous tanks captured from the Italian mechanized division in Korçë were undamaged and were immediately put into use. A large amount of fuel was also seized. According to news today, Italian troops are currently constructing new defensive lines twenty-five miles west of Korçë, preparing to resist a Greek counterattack. (International dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Italian Mechanized Unit - One Division Annihilated</p>
<p>Athens: Yesterday's war report claimed that Greek forces attacking Korçë had completely annihilated an entire Italian mechanized division. It was also claimed that 120 tanks were left behind by the Italian troops retreating from the area, so the total fall of the city is imminent. According to frontline news, the remnants of the Italian army in the area have fled into Yugoslavia and have been detained. Previous reports had claimed that the outer perimeter of Korçë had been occupied by Greek forces, but claiming complete occupation would be too premature. It is understood that the Italian Army Headquarters has rushed an elite division to northern Albania to counterattack the Greek forces that are besieging this important transportation hub, as it is the Italian army's base of operations. But Greek forces repelled this counterattack and caused the Italian troops to retreat to Yugoslavia. On the Epirus front, along the Kalamas River, Italian troops are continuing their general retreat. It is rumored that a large Italian contingent in the Greek-West region has been surrounded. The Greek High Command claims that recent Greek victories have brought Italian military operations to a complete standstill. Neutral observers here believe that, given the attacks by British and Greek aircraft, it would take considerable time for the Italian army to reorganize its land forces. The harassment tactics of the British and Greek air forces have forced the enemy to continue to take a defensive posture. (International dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Italian Military Bases - Heavily Bombed by British Air Force</p>
<p>Thessaloniki: It is claimed that all Italian military supply bases have been heavily bombed by the British air force. Brindisi and Bari, which are important ports for the embarkation of Italian troops and military supplies, have also been repeatedly heavily damaged by British aircraft. Italian airfields within Albanian territory have also not been spared. The movement of Italian troops has been greatly hindered as a result of the heavy bombing by the British and Greek air forces. Military authorities greatly admire the glorious achievements of the British air force currently operating within Greek territory. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Aden: Officials announced today that the British air force carried out its seventieth air raid against Italian-held Asseb on Friday, and the railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti was also attacked that day. An important station was bombed once or twice, and bombs hit buildings, and the railway tracks and bridges were also damaged. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Korçë Bridge - Confirmed to Be Occupied by Greek Forces; Italian War Report Claims - Frontline Situation Is Quiet</p>
<p>London: Military sources here claim that a bridge overlooking Korçë has indeed been occupied by Greek forces. Korçë is expected to fall into Greek hands soon. It is anticipated that Italian troops will make their utmost effort to defend the area, as it would be extremely difficult to recapture once lost. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to the Italian military headquarters, the situation on the Greek front is quiet. In the Korçë area, a Greek cavalry unit was annihilated. Italian troops bombed bridges and roads, factories and barracks in the Kalibaki and Korçë areas. Italian aircraft also strafed anti-aircraft positions with machine guns. Italian aircraft bombed the island of Corfu; two aircraft did not return. A British aircraft was shot down near Sicily and the pilot was captured. Italian aircraft bombed the Souda naval base in Crete, and in Alexandria, Egypt, hit a ship and a British cruiser in the harbor. In North Africa, Italian aircraft bombed railways in Tobruk and other places. British aircraft bombed Benghazi, killing two women and one child, and destroying many civilian houses. The British air raid on Bardia caused no damage. In Italian East Africa, a British cruiser attempted to bombard the port of Mogadishu, but was repelled by coastal artillery. The ship released a smoke screen as it fled. British aircraft bombed Agordat, causing slight damage but no casualties. A British aircraft was shot down near Lake Rudolf. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Greek Troops Are Brave and Hardworking - Repel Superior Italian Forces</p>
<p>Thessaloniki: Greek troops are daily demonstrating their bravery and perseverance. Each soldier carries only a small amount of bread and dry cheese, and a few olives, and sleeps very little, yet they are vigorously repelling enemy forces that are far better equipped than they are, without showing any fatigue. Moreover, in a rugged and mountainous region with numerous ravines and cliffs, they have charged with bayonets to attack Italian machine gun nests. The rate of advance of Greek forces in the western region, around Korçë, and in the central Pindus region is currently maintained daily and is not reduced by Italian aerial bombing.

<h3>Mussolini Delivers a Speech - Will Fight the British and Greeks to the End - Vows to Avenge Italian Troops Killed in Action - Acknowledges Three Major Italian Ships Were Damaged</h3>
<p>Rome: Today is the fifth anniversary of the League of Nations sanctions against Italy. Fascist youth groups in cities and villages are marching in celebration. Representatives from Fascist parties across the country arrived in Rome this morning and reported to Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia at noon, after which they listened to the Prime Minister's speech. The Fascist Party's organ reports that this sanction was the prelude to Europe's victory against the British Empire's autocracy. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech to the masses at the Palazzo Venezia from 12:30 PM to 12:55 PM today. The audience of over 10,000 people cheered enthusiastically after the speech. Mussolini nearly came out onto the balcony. This speech was simultaneously broadcast on the radio. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: Today is the fifth anniversary of the League of Nations' announcement of sanctions against Italy. Mussolini delivered a speech inside the Palazzo Venezia to over a thousand representatives from Fascist parties from across Italy. Mussolini first pointed out that the League of Nations' announcement of sanctions against Italy was the last attack of the old world against the revolutionary new Europe, and Italy's victory is the victory of the new Europe. Mussolini then explained the reasons why Britain should bear full responsibility for this war. He claimed that if Britain had not adopted a policy of encircling Germany, and if Britain had not, at the last moment, put forward conditions that Germany had to withdraw its troops from Poland, conditions that Germany could hardly accept, then peace could still have been maintained. He also said that when Italy joined the war, France was already wavering but had not yet surrendered. The Italian army fought bravely and achieved excellent results. The British army's defeat in Somaliland and the Italian army's conquest of Sidi el Barrani were the starting point for the advance and not the end of the war. Moreover, the Italian navy defeated the enemy's self-proclaimed invincible fleet. Mussolini then made a bold statement, saying that the number of aircraft currently produced in Italian factories is four times higher than the pre-war production rate, and the discipline and perseverance of the Italian people are also admired by informed people. At this point in his speech, Mussolini criticized Churchill, saying that his statements about the bombing of Taranto were insincere and full of falsehoods. He said that although Italian ships had been hit, they had not been sunk, and only one ship had been heavily damaged. In short, Churchill's words were exaggerated, and his claims of victory were at least six times greater than the truth, which is not worth the scorn of informed people. Mussolini solemnly pointed out that Germany and Italy will continue to fight side by side, and there will be progress in political, military, and economic activities and cooperation. His and Hitler's opinions are completely aligned. Italian aircraft are assisting German aircraft in bombing England not because the German air force needs help, but to show a spirit of shared hatred and mutual support. Mussolini discussed the Italian-Greek war, saying that Greece's mask has finally been removed. The Greeks had long harbored resentment towards Italy, and documents found by German troops in France show that in May of this year, the Greek government had offered its territory to the British and French governments as a base of operations for their troops. What more can be said? He then pointed out that the mountainous terrain of Epirus is not suitable for blitzkrieg tactics, but he is confident of achieving victory. As for whether it takes two months to defeat Greece, or twelve months to conquer it, it is not of great importance. In short, if he starts doing something, he will do it to the end. The blood shed by Italian soldiers in Epirus will not be shed in vain, and this vengeance will be avenged. Italy has a million soldiers, and there are still eight million strong men who can be conscripted into battle at any time. His conclusion was that the German-Italian bloc has 150 million people, and its power stretches from Norway to Libya, and victory is in the hands of this bloc. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: In today's speech commemorating the fifth anniversary of the sanctions, Mussolini criticized British Prime Minister Churchill for increasing the British victory by six times regarding the British air raid on Taranto. The true extent of Italian losses was that three ships were hit, but none were sunk, and only one was heavily damaged and would take time to repair. According to the opinion of all technical personnel, the other two ships can be quickly restored to their original condition. The British claims that two more warships and two auxiliary ships have been sunk are fictitious. Mussolini also said that the Italian navy is very effective in protecting transport routes, and the British navy cannot cut them off, and cannot even try to disrupt them. Mussolini concluded by saying that the final peace must be a "peace of the Axis powers", and the announcements issued by the Italian side are all in line with the true facts.

<h3>Large Numbers of British Aircraft Bomb Hamburg / British and German Heavy Artillery Exchange Fire Across the Sea</h3>
<p>London – It was announced today that on Saturday night and Sunday morning, a large number of British bombers, in multiple squadrons, successively flew to the urban and suburban areas of Hamburg to carry out the most intense bombing. The bombing lasted for several hours, focusing on the city's major industries. More than a thousand bombs have already been dropped on the area around the riverside railway freight yard in the Billwerder district. The results of the bombing varied depending on the weather conditions, but when many British aircraft arrived, the weather was extremely favorable for bombing. The aircraft formations also fiercely attacked the Blohm+Voss shipyard, witnessing many hits in the area, with explosions and fires erupting. A nearby aircraft factory was also hit by a bomb. Other targets, such as important oil refineries, the Altona electrical plant, and industrial targets, were all subjected to heavy bombing by British aircraft, with many tons of bombs dropped. According to the Air Ministry, when the British Air Force completed its attack, the cloud cover was dense, making it impossible to see the specific bombing results in detail. However, what was seen was enough to determine that the damage was severe. (Reuter's wire, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Regarding the British Intelligence Department's claim that the British Air Force had bombed oil refineries in the Cologne-Niehl, Bremen, Dortmund-Ems Canal area on November 16, official sources here have flatly denied it, stating that the reports are completely inaccurate. No British aircraft were shot down over German territory during the daytime of November 16. All losses suffered by British aircraft occurred during the night of that day. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>London – The Royal Air Force carried out extensive bombing along the French coast last night, from Boulogne to Calais, with flashes of exploding bombs visible everywhere. At the same time, British and German heavy artillery exchanged fire across the English Channel. German heavy artillery, in retaliation for British air raids and long-range shelling, fiercely bombarded the British coast from the coast. Simultaneously, British artillery on the cliffs of Dover opened fire, and "Hellfire Corner" also began operations, challenging the enemy. The British military's attacks on the so-called German invasion bases have not stopped. German heavy artillery in Cap Gris-Nez and Calais, across the English Channel, also returned fire, with the whistling sound of shells passing over the water constantly heard. The flashes of German artillery fire were clearly visible along the bombarded southeastern coast of England. The British battery "Hellfire Corner" immediately returned fire, with mutual bombardment lasting for three hours. Towns near the British coast experienced tremors every three minutes, and over a thousand people rushed to the hills to seek refuge. The Royal Air Force also simultaneously dispatched aircraft to France to find bombing targets. Therefore, the flash of exploding bombs was followed by the sound of explosions, and the light of searchlights illuminated the entire airspace of Boulogne and Calais, as bright as a picture.

<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin – Yesterday and last night, German aircraft bombed military targets in southern England and armaments factories in central England. One merchant ship was sunk off the east coast of England, and another merchant ship was hit by bombs. British escort fleets attempted to sneak through the English Channel in the dark but were repelled by German long-range artillery. Many, terrified by the intensity of the artillery fire, took refuge in British ports. Several towns in western Germany were bombed by British aircraft last night, and fires that broke out were immediately extinguished. Several bombs landed in residential areas and churches, with some houses destroyed and several civilians injured. Several air battles occurred over the English Channel, with three British aircraft lost and seven German aircraft missing. (Haitong wire, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German High Command issued the following supplementary war report to a reporter from the Haitong News Agency: German aircraft carried out group bombings of Coventry, the center of the British arms industry. Fires were also started by hits in the Midlands and southern England. The results of the German aircraft's bombing proved that they had all hit important British arms industries and food transportation systems, including the Kensington Ordnance Factory, docks, Paddington Station, and Waterloo Station, which are considered important. German aircraft also targeted important military facilities when bombing London and other cities. Portsmouth and Southampton, important seaports on the south coast of England, were also bombed by German aircraft, which could directly strike the enemy's nerves. The loss of British merchant ship tonnage further complicated British shipping. The war report stated that another 8,000-ton merchant ship, a 3,000-ton cargo ship, and a 3,000-ton oil tanker were sunk. In addition, two cargo ships were destroyed. German aircraft continued to drop mines in various British ports, thereby intensifying the blockade. (Haitong wire, 18th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Air Battle Occurs Over London / British Claim 13 German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London – The suburbs of London have been subjected to attacks by large explosive bombs and basket bombs for two nights. Yesterday, they were again subjected to heavy strikes by large explosive bombs. In both nights of attacks, fierce air battles occurred. As formations of German aircraft attempted to advance over the Thames Estuary, the resulting engagement led to at least thirteen German aircraft being shot down, while the British lost five aircraft. (International Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>London – Last night, the German Air Force continued its intense air raids on England in retaliation. Large high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell like rain in central London. One bomb exploded at the entrance of an air-raid shelter, killing five people and injuring twenty. A hospital was hit by a bomb, resulting in casualties among the general public. Other German bombing formations fiercely bombed cities in Wales and East Anglia. The intensity of the German aerial blitz last night gradually decreased, followed by a long period of silence, due to adverse weather conditions over the English Channel, making flying difficult. Last night, British bombers and long-range artillery continued to bombard Nazi invasion bases on the French coast. (International Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry announced that another thirteen German aircraft were shot down during the attack on Britain yesterday, including twelve shot down by British fighter aircraft and one shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Most of the aircraft were Messerschmitt and Heinkel models. The British also lost five fighter aircraft, but it was reported that four pilots were unharmed. The most intense German aircraft attacks yesterday occurred in the afternoon, with over a hundred German aircraft, mostly fighters, attacking the Thames Estuary. However, the German aircraft seemed unmotivated and were easily repelled by the British Air Force. It was also disclosed that in the week ending at midnight on November 16, the British shot down sixty-four German aircraft and thirteen Italian aircraft, while the British lost six fighter aircraft, but three pilots were rescued safely. (Reuter's wire, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Recently, German aircraft have been bombing England day and night regardless of weather conditions in retaliation. A young German pilot named Chrischin, whose base is in northern France, recently spoke to a special reporter from the Haitong News Agency about his flying experiences, saying that on a certain day, the air pressure in northern France was extremely low, and it was raining. At night, we still took off as usual, launching our aircraft into layers of gray clouds. We continued to ascend until we reached over 2,800 meters before reaching clear weather. Then we flew towards our destination. When we arrived over the Channel, we saw searchlights cutting through the clouds, searching the sky. We continued to advance, and the clouds suddenly dispersed. London was already in front of us. We chose a target, dropped our bombs, and saw that the world's second-largest city was once again in flames. After the observers verified that the bombs had all hit their targets, they informed the companions and the pilot to break through the British anti-aircraft fire net and fly back to our original base. This was my personal fiftieth flight. (Haitong wire, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin – This morning, several German fighter planes engaged in fierce combat for a long time with multiple British bomber escorts. Three British aircraft and one barrage balloon were shot down. (Haitong wire, 18th)</p>

<h3>A Painful History of the European War (3) / Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy / (2) Gamamelin: Seeing What Needs to Be Done, But Unable to Do It</h3>
<p>In mid-1938, dark clouds were gathering, fully indicating a crisis for the French ruling elite. At that time, I had many opportunities to talk to them about Gamelin. I often asked, "I wonder what General Gamelin's intentions are?"</p>
<p>I heard that the French government held two important meetings: one in May when the crisis was imminent, and one before the Munich Agreement. Attending were senior officials from the defense and foreign affairs ministries, as well as the heads of the navy, army, and air force, forming an informal wartime cabinet centered around Daladier. They had to answer an important question: "If France is forced to go to war, does it have the strength to do so?" At the time, Navy Minister Darlan replied, "The Navy can certainly fight, and with the assistance of the British fleet, there is no need to worry about the sea." This was definitely not a deceptive statement.</p>
<p>Air Force Minister Guy La Chambre had previously been invited to Berlin by German Air Force Minister General Göring. Göring had tried his best to exaggerate the state of preparation of the German Air Force, causing him to be overawed. During the meeting, Guy La Chambre wrung his hands, revealing a look of despair, and said, "After the start of the war, within just two weeks, France will have no aircraft left." By September, his spirit was even more depressed, and he added a heartbreaking remark, saying, "At the beginning of the war, our army will have to fight with the Air Force reserves. Their being shot down by the enemy is predictable. The excellent Air Force soldiers must be reserved for later use, waiting for excellent aircraft to be dispatched for combat."</p>
<p>As for Gamelin? His attitude in September was consistent with that in May. He ignored the two ministers and smiled meaningfully, saying, "The Army is ready to go."</p>
<p>One day, I said to Foreign Minister Bonnet, "If the Army is fully prepared, it doesn't matter if there is no Air Force. However, our army cannot attack the Siegfried Line! What can be done about that! We should have a battle plan in advance. Do you think Gamelin has a plan?"</p>
<p>"I hear he has a plan in mind."</p>
<p>That was all I was able to find out. Bonnet knew more than I did, but I had no way of judging. Gamelin and Daladier were both "golden men with velvet mouths." It was unknowable whether the commander-in-chief had even explained the battle plan to Daladier.</p>
<p>According to my personal conjecture, Gamelin might take advantage of the German and Italian exaggeration of the Rome-Berlin Axis to tie Italy's fate to Germany. Once the war broke out, he would strike first, fiercely attacking Italy to flank Germany. Bonnet replied, "Your assumption might have been useful in mid-May, but now it is mid-September, and the Alpine passes have long been blocked."</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1938, I walked shoulder to shoulder with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Herriot on the sidewalk near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>He said, "We are too nice to Italy. It is ridiculous and dangerous to think that we can be at peace just by being submissive to her."</p>
<p>I replied, "Italian public opinion is more important than the government and should be made fully aware of the fragility of Italy's position. Does our General Staff understand this matter? As for Corsica, our preparations are not yet fully adequate."</p>
<p>Herriot nodded and said, "Gamelin, you know that he doesn't rely solely on courage, which is good, but I'm afraid he's too timid."</p>
<p>It was the first time I heard such clear and straightforward words, and from the mouth of someone powerful.</p>
<p>In August 1939, a week before the outbreak of war, I had frequent contact with the government. We all hoped that peace could still be maintained, and Bonnet was extremely diligent, working tirelessly. However, the situation was gradually shifting towards the military side. "What are Gamelin's intentions?" This question was being asked more and more often.</p>
<p>According to general impressions, Gamelin was very confident in the Army but very worried about the Air Force. Our Air Force would not be fully prepared until mid-November. He hoped that the German Air Force would not disrupt his mobilization plan too much. Fortunately, there was adequate supply in terms of air defense.</p>
<p>August 26 was a day I will never forget. It was my birthday, and a foreign political figure passed through Paris and spoke to me about a very urgent matter.</p>
<p>He was one of the most outstanding figures among the politicians I had met. I considered myself extremely fortunate to be able to meet with him. However, for many reasons, I had to go against my usual style of speaking candidly and thoroughly and conceal his name.</p>
<p>After meeting him, after a brief greeting, he said, "The severity of the situation is probably well known, so there is no need to repeat it. I am very worried about France and Britain. They regard war as a hateful thing but do not give much thought to the consequences of the war. This is a big mistake. If you lack ideals, courage, and creativity, don't expect to win. If you only want to avoid difficulties and seek temporary peace, you will have already lost before the war even starts. This is truly frightening to say. I know you have the ability to influence the government. Please advise Daladier and tell Bonnet: 'Mussolini is not a clever man, but he is a very cunning character. He is about to play a huge trick on you. He will remain temporarily dormant, waiting for an opportunity. One or two weeks before Hitler's victory is assured, he will declare war on you and share the spoils with Hitler.'"</p>
<p>He continued, "Your government must immediately demand of Mussolini: 'You must decide whether you are a friend or an enemy within forty-eight hours.' Mussolini is trying to avoid getting involved in the war vortex at the moment. He has never been very clear about the strength of his country's air force and artillery, and he has recently received reports that have disappointed him. Italian public opinion is also against participating in the war. If Mussolini replies with excuses and promises to remain neutral, then demand that he allow French troops to occupy several important cities, such as Turin and Milan, and allow French troops to pass through. If he threatens to participate in the war, tell the Italian people the truth about the situation and France's attitude. Within two weeks, Mussolini will surely fall. If France continues to flatter Mussolini, the consequences will be unimaginable."</p>
<p>He continued, "The British are more sluggish, and Churchill is not yet in power. They will know later on. Your government will of course consult with the General Staff. This is truly absurd! The staff officers are actually just public servants of the country. I have also held national office and understand their psychology. They are only afraid of trouble, striving to reduce responsibility, and are no different from civil officials. They are obedient by nature. If you go to them for advice, they will surely shake their heads repeatedly and say, 'No! No! The current situation is already troublesome enough.'" So don't ask them, "Should this be done?" Just ask, "If you were ordered to do it, how would you do it?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Why don't you go and say it directly, instead of having me relay it? I can be a mediator, and I can assist from the sidelines at the time."</p>
<p>To avoid being overheard by spies, a certain dignitary met at my residence the next day, Sunday. That politician was very eloquent, as he had been yesterday, leaving a deep impression. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>U.S. Labor Union Suggests Complete Boycott of Japanese Goods / Federal Congress Presents Draft Report / Praises Roosevelt's Defense Program</h3>
<p>New Orleans - The American Federation of Labor Committee, on the eve of the Federal Sixty-Year Congress last night, suggested a complete boycott of Japanese goods. This suggestion is contained in a report that will soon be submitted to the Congress. It is widely believed that the suggestion may have a final decision-making nature. The Congress is scheduled to open today. The report praises President Roosevelt's Western Hemisphere defense program, suggests boycotting Japanese goods, and expresses "displeasure" with Rome, Berlin, and the Axis's intention to create a "new order." The content of the report differs from the one submitted by Lewis to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, as Lewis's report attacks the President's economic and tax programs, while the Labor Committee praises the President's policies. The Labor Committee also called for increased retirement pensions, expanded social security legislation, and also requested the strict implementation of wage and hour legislation. The Committee also appealed to members not to allow manipulation and troublemakers to infiltrate. The report stated, "We absolutely do not allow anyone to manipulate the market, disrupt public order, and violate the law. The millions of members of the American Federation of Labor Committee are all honest and law-abiding people." (United Press wire, 18th)</p>
<h3>Rumor that German Ships Were Intercepted by U.S. Warships</h3>
<p>Tampico - This morning, local newspapers quoted Mexican gunboat "Queretaro" Captain Piran saying, "I am sure that the four German cargo ships intercepted offshore of Tampico on Saturday were intercepted by U.S. destroyers, not British warships." (International News Service wire, 18th)</p>
<p>Tampico - After the incident of the interception of four German cargo ships by four warships on Saturday, the U.S. sent three destroyers to the scene yesterday to investigate. At the same time, the Mexican Foreign Ministry is investigating whether the German ships were intercepted by British or Canadian warships. The Mexican President is personally investigating whether the German ships' retreat to the protected area ten miles upstream of the Panuco River violates the neutral zone, in order to make a decision. The President is also consulting with Foreign Minister Hay. It is widely believed that if these warships are indeed British or Canadian warships, Mexico may request that the Pan-American Conference lodge a formal protest. The Mexican President has also ordered the Tampico port authorities to collect all evidence from the captains and sailors of the German cargo ships and from eyewitnesses on shore and send it to Mexico City. Mexican authorities declined to comment on the fact that three U.S. warships sailed to the scene. (International News Service wire, 18th)</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Reviews British Policy</h3>
<p>Berlin - The "People's Observer" recently wrote an article reviewing British policy on November 18, the fifth anniversary of the imposition of sanctions on Italy by the League of Nations in Geneva. It stated that November 18 was the most important turning point in European history after the World War. The article stated that, in addition to Italy realizing its demands, the result of the Abyssinian War not only exposed Britain's weakness but also greatly undermined France's hope of launching a new invasion along the Ruhr region. This caused the center of gravity in Europe to shift. However, after Britain's defeat in Abyssinia and the collapse of the Geneva system, it did not change course. Eden's slow policy continued until the spring of 1938, but this policy continued to be implemented under Chamberlain's rule, transforming into the events of September 3, 1939. Britain often made deceptive statements, stating that it did not oppose a new European order in principle but insisted that various issues should be resolved based on existing treaties and agreements. Britain's attitude in the months before the outbreak of the war adequately demonstrated its contradictions. As early as 1935, the sanctions against Italy revealed Britain's intention to wage war, attempting to starve its opponent and using its hypocritical theories to seek the sympathy of other countries to help Britain fight. Today, the disappointment Britain has gained from pursuing this policy is no less than the losses it suffered after the defeat in Abyssinia.

<h3>Defeat Japanese Aggression and Establish Peace in the Far East: Prominent American Professor Publishes Proposals, Urging All Countries to Renounce Rights in China</h3>
<p>New York – Noted Far East scholar and Columbia University professor Nathaniel Peffer yesterday published an article arguing that defeating Japan is the first and necessary condition for establishing lasting peace in the Far East. Peffer's article, published in the "Far Eastern Survey," besides advocating the defeat of Japan, also stated that Western countries should renounce their territorial, political, and economic rights in China in order to safeguard peace in the Far East. Japan's military aggression in China and the West's commercial aggression in China must end simultaneously, so that China has the opportunity to strengthen itself and can independently safeguard its integrity.

<h3>The Society for Research in Chinese Architecture Investigates Architecture in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Kangding</h3>
<p>(Kunming News) After investigating the ancient architecture in the Kunming city area and western Yunnan in 1938, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture again engaged in investigation work in Sichuan and Kangding in September 1939. The investigation team was led by full-time researchers Liang Sicheng and Liu Dunzhen. They departed from Kunming at the end of August, passed through Guiyang, and arrived in Chongqing at the beginning of September. After completing the investigation of architecture in Chongqing City and Ba County and Jiangbei County, they transferred from Chongqing to Chengdu in late September to investigate nearby relics and the irrigation works and bridges of Guan County. They then went southwest from Chengdu to Ya'an and Lushan, following the Qingyi River eastward, passing through Jiashan, Leshan, Emei, Pengshan, and other counties, and returned to Chengdu. In mid-November, they followed the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway from Chengdu, passing through Xindu, Guanghan, Mianyang, Zitong Jiange, and Daba North Guangyuan, and went south along the Jialing River from Guangyuan, passing through Zhaohua, Cangxi, Langzhong, Nanbu, and Peng'an, and turned east to Qu County. From southwest Qu County through Yan'an, they arrived in Yuechi on New Year's Day 1940. Then they went northwest through Nanchong, Pengxi, and Suining, turned south to Tongnan and Dazu, and then turned northeast from Dazu to Tongqu and Hechuan. They returned to Chongqing by waterway, still passing through Guiyang on the return journey, and arrived in Kunming. The journey lasted more than half a year, passing through more than thirty counties and cities. The ancient architecture and related art investigated are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Que of the Han Dynasty" – Tomb gate towers of the Han Dynasty and the Han system. After surveying and mapping, there are 16 seats of Gaoyi Que in Ya'an, Yangzong and Yangchang Que in Jiajiang, Pingyang Fujun Que in Mianyang, Yanggong Que and Jia Gong Que and Bian Xiaoniu Que in Zitong, Feng Huan Que and Shen Fujun Que in Qu County, and the unnamed Que in Nanmu Bridge and Wangjiaping Zhaojiaping. In terms of quantity, they account for almost two-thirds of the Han Que in the country. The architectural styles and decorative themes they represent are important examples of Han culture. In addition, although the Que body of Wang Zhizi Que in Xindu, Li Ye Que in Zitong, and the East Que of Gaoyi in Ya'an were destroyed, only a part of the text remains, and they are all relics of the Eastern Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>(2) "Cliff Tombs" – Cliff tombs of the Han system. After investigation, there are Baiya and Miezipu in Leshan, Jiangkou Town in Pengshan, Baiyundong in Mianyang, Tangjiagou in Guangyuan, Beiya in Langzhong, and Fengjiawan in Yuechi. Among them, the tombs in Baiya, Leshan are the most magnificent in scale. The walls of the tomb hall are combined with relief pillars, arches, eaves, Xiang tiles, etc., which show the wooden architectural situation at that time. The rectangular columns and octagonal columns carved in the tombs of Jiangkou in Pengshan are the first examples of pillars with brackets in Han tombs that have not been introduced to the world.</p>
<p>(3) "Grottoes and Statues" – The earliest statues investigated this time are the Buddha statues engraved in the third year of Datong on Liang of Pingyang Fujun Que in Mianyang, the Cliff inscription of the Emperor Wenhuang in the fourteenth year of the Sui Dynasty in Jianxikou of Langzhong, and the Taoist statues carved in the sixth year of Daye in Xishan Guan of Mianyang. The latter is the oldest known relic of Taoist art today. When the grotto statues of the Tang Dynasty came down, they became popular in Shu, such as in Zitong, Guangyuan, Zhaohua, Langzhong, Mianyang, Jiajiang, Leshan, Dazu, Hechuan, Tongnan and many other relics, and their quantity and art all surpassed the previous generations. After the Zhao and Song dynasties, although the statues in the Central Plains had been slightly reduced, they were still very prosperous in Shu for a while. In addition to opening up new cliffs in Tongnan, Dazu, and Ba County, there are still continuations of Tang Dynasty operations in Dazu, Hechuan, Guangyuan, and Jiajiang. Even in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, there were creations. The number is large, and the themes include Peacock Ming King, Thousand-Hand Guanyin, and Nine Children's Mothers, which are not found in other cliff carvings.</p>
<p>(4) "Wooden Architecture" – According to the investigation, the earliest of these relics is the Ming Dynasty, but they still retain many Song Dynasty techniques, which are quite rare. There are the Feilai Hall built in the 24th year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty in Emei, and the Juehuang Hall of Guangfu Temple in Lushan, the main hall of Jiangwei Temple and Jiangqing Building, the halls of Pengxi Jiufeng Temple and the main hall of Baofan Temple, the hall of Zitong Agate Temple, the halls of Wenchang Palace, and the main halls of Jiange Jueyuan Temple and Nanchang Temple built since Xuande.</p>
<p>(5) "Pagodas, Pillars, and Others" – Pagoda and pillar relics are rare. Only the Southern Song Pagoda of Zhen'en Temple in Dazu, the Song Pagoda of Lingyun Temple in Leshan, the Tang Pagoda of Baoguang Temple in Xindu, and the Pengta of Jiufeng Temple in Pengxi were investigated. The iron pillar of the Iron Pagoda Temple in Langzhong was cast in the fourth year of Kaiyuan in the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>(6) "Related Arts" – After investigation, there are Ming Dynasty artifacts, tile houses, stone coffins, statues, bronze bells, etc. collected by public and private individuals, Liang stele of Zhengyin Temple in Xindu, and murals of the Ming Dynasty in Jiangyu Building in Lushan, Dingxiang Temple in Pengxi Baofan Temple, Agate Temple in Zitong, Jueyuan Temple and Nanchang Temple in Jiange.</p>
<p>Other folk houses, shops, guild halls, courtyards, memorial archways, tombs, bridges, and architecture are collected everywhere, and the gains are also very rich.</p>

<h3>Food: Rice Prices Cannot Be Suppressed, Clearly Controlled by Speculators; But See How Foreign Rice Comes in an Endless Stream, This City Has No Shortage</h3>
<p>After several fluctuations yesterday, foreign rice finally fell by one to one and a half yuan in the afternoon. In the morning, because foreign rice arrived in an endless stream, and Chinese goods were also suitable for flat exchanges, people's hearts tended to stabilize, and the opening price immediately fell. Then there were scattered purchases, and the market improved, rising and falling suddenly, with inconsistent gains and losses. By noon, the gains were only a small three or four corners. In the afternoon, rumors arose in the market, and the talk of peace was undoubtedly unfavorable to buyers, so the market fell sharply by more than one yuan. As a result, it was less than one yuan to one yuan and five or six corners lower than Saturday. No. 1 Saigon rice was 74.5 yuan at the highest, then fell to 72.5 yuan, No. 2 was 69.5 yuan and 68.5 yuan, fire jiao was 72.5 yuan at the highest, and then fell to 69 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 67 yuan and 8 corners to 66 yuan and 2 corners, small jiao was 66 yuan and 8 corners and 66.5 yuan, Mi Lu was 59 yuan and 58.5 yuan, broken rice was 55.5 yuan and 54 yuan, Wuhu Jian was 67 yuan and 2 corners and 67 yuan.

Spot original packages were sold for 82.5 yuan to 82 yuan, November was 81 yuan to 80 yuan and 5 corners, December was 79 yuan to 78.5 yuan, and small jiao was 77 yuan to 76.5 yuan in early December.

According to rumors, the new transaction was sold by Heyi, 1,000 tons of No. 1 in December, at a price of 82 yuan. The repurchase of No. 1 in December then returned from 82 yuan to 81.5 yuan.</p>

Afterwards, Hong Kong and Vietnam will continue to arrive in an endless stream. This city has absolutely no shortage of rice and grain, so rice prices cannot be suppressed and are clearly controlled by speculators. (Zu)</p>
<p>Two mornings of new japonica and wild rice and green seeds arrived totaling two thousand stones, and because the sales area saw a dull situation, the stomach of the street was slow, resulting in the market being only fair.

However, because the exchange rate did not show significant easing, there were still buyers during the decline. In the afternoon, the price once fell to a low of 5,635 yuan. The easing of the exchange rate was limited, and the US dollar rebounded, causing a covering wave, rising by about 50 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 5,682 yuan, down 26 yuan from last Saturday's close. The total trading volume for the day was 4,000 taels. The cash price was 10 yuan lower than the futures price. Swaps were not opened. The price of gold jewelry ultimately fell by a small 10 yuan. Customs gold remained level.</p>
<p>Refined Gold Down 26 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, sentiment was quite high, and the opening price immediately rose. Securities firms entered the market with 10 taels, at 5,730 yuan. Money changers then entered with 20 taels, further rising by 10 yuan, to 5,745 yuan. Subsequently, due to a slight hardening of the exchange rate, securities firms and money changers unanimously sold, immediately pulling back to within the 700 yuan range. Securities firms sold 30 taels, quoting 5,675 yuan. However, the buying sentiment of gold and silver shops soon emerged, entering the market to purchase, and the price rose. Gold shops entered the market with 20 taels of securities, reaching 5,710 yuan. Unfortunately, the market then weakened again. The market sentiment was bearish, and gold and silver shops sold securities again, resulting in a series of low prices. The lowest price was when gold shops sold 20 taels to silver shops, closing at only 5,655 yuan. Silver shops traded 20 taels, quoting 5,668 yuan. In the afternoon, silver shops traded 20 taels, at 5,665 yuan. Later, due to the strong selling pressure from securities firms, the price fell by dozens of yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to securities firms, quoting 5,635 yuan. However, it was heard that the exchange rate remained level, and silver shops and money changers purchased some, causing the price to rebound to 5,687 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from silver shops. Later, the price fluctuated slightly by over 10 yuan. The evening closing price was 5,682 yuan, with gold shops buying 10 taels from silver shops, down 26 yuan from last weekend. The total fluctuation for the day was 100 yuan. The selling price of the cash shops' standard gold was higher than refined gold by more than 1 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold was lower than the standard gold by 50 to 60 yuan, and trading was scarce.</p>
<p>Jewelry Down Small 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was lowered by 10 yuan at 11:15 in the morning, and did not change afterwards. Da Tong Hang quoted 580 yuan, and the new merchants quoted similar prices. The purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies All Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw refined gold prices rise and then fall. British, American, and other currencies also fell by 5 jiao each. British gold notes saw almost no trading, and the market price remained stagnant. American gold notes followed a downward trend, rebounding slightly in the afternoon, with the evening price at 16 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen, down 1 jiao 2 fen from last Saturday's close. Hong Kong notes initially rose to a call price of 1 yuan, but eventually retreated to the original price of 3 yuan 9 jiao 8 fen. Japanese and Korean notes trended very soft, with the former falling to 1 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen, and the latter falling to 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Low to Four and a Half Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts continued to decline, with the discount rate for every 1,000 yuan falling to 4 and a half yuan, and the purchase rate only 3 and a half yuan, down another 5 jiao from last Saturday. The money industry association's call loan rate was 7 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, up 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Securities Internal Debt Market Leaning Towards Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market saw a decline in the morning and a sudden sharp rise in the afternoon. This was because the market fabricated unfounded peace rumors, leading to a strong surge in the afternoon. This shows that market sentiment is leaning towards buying. Even though positive rumors are unfounded, the upward trend will still occur. Although negative rumors are of great importance, market prices do not seem to be affected. This shows that the majority of the market participants are buyers. Yesterday, the price of Category C shares reached 1 yuan 5 jiao again, but still could not break through. The lowest price in the morning was 1 yuan 7 jiao, and the market closed at the lowest price. Buying was mostly driven by speculation. Apart from Tongkang's consistent selling strategy and Shunchang's long positions emerging, the rest were just frequent buying and selling for small profits. As a result, market prices rose by 3, 4, or 5 jiao. The total trading volume was 1.8 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of the Cotton Yarn Exchange were traded at a price of 40 yuan 27 and a half jiao.</p>
<p>Also, the opening price of the stock market at the Public Industry Association was stable and firm. However, when prices rose, there was occasional profit-taking on steel shares. Steel shares were special because of the announcement of an interim dividend of 2 yuan, which once reached a high of 34 yuan 75 jiao. The amount of this dividend was somewhat disappointing, and the market reacted slightly afterwards. However, its underlying trend remained good. Rubber stocks were also firm and stable.</p>
<h3>Mayling Deng Pays Interim Dividend</h3>
<p>Mayling Deng Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend for 1940 on November 2, at an annual rate of 5%.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Sudden Rumors Cotton Yarn Lacking Short Selling Double Horse Rose Then Fell Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell. Actual sales were still good. Xiang Gang merchants purchased more than 1,000 bales. However, the general gold shops in the market made adjustments based entirely on the tightness of the exchange rate. Therefore, as soon as the US dollar slightly rebounded, they immediately sold regardless of everything. The market was suppressed by this. However, the mindset of the industry was mostly firm and bullish, because inventory was decreasing daily. 20-count Double Horse reached a high of 1,275 yuan and a low of 1,239 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the current yarn market in the morning continued the bullish trend of the previous day, and buying was particularly strong. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,270 yuan, rising to 1,275 yuan. However, as profit-taking emerged, the price fell back to 1,265 yuan. The exchange rate opened quietly, and the price rose again to 1,268 yuan, fluctuating around 60 yuan for a long time. Subsequently, upon hearing that gold prices were falling and the exchange rate was slightly higher, market sentiment suddenly became weak. Gold shops sold off one after another, and peace rumors flourished. The market gradually fell to 1,240 yuan. Many people were selling overnight short positions, so the market was even more affected. The mid-day trading volume was 7,580 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 10 yuan. The amount of purchases by various merchants is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,080 Industry 6,500 Total 7,580</p>
<p>Afternoon news: Initially, the situation was still soft. Then, hearing that the exchange rate was softening, market sentiment was more buoyant than in the morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Port Cotton Inventory Not Abundant Cotton Merchants Unwilling to Sell Cheaply</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains quiet, but factory trading remains calm. Most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, the market price is slightly relaxed. Fire brand cotton is priced at 208 yuan to 206.5 yuan per bale. Pengjiapu cotton is priced at 160 odd and a half yuan per bale. Pingleer cotton is priced at 175 yuan per bale.</p>
<p>Another report: The market price of foreign cotton is slightly softer on the New York cotton market. Due to the decline in stock prices on Wall Street, the closing price was 5 to 6 pound tones lower than the previous day. The Indian market situation was level.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai Port has been exceptionally quiet in recent days. All parties maintain a wait-and-see attitude. Factories have little intention to purchase, while the industry maintains that the market inventory is not abundant and is unwilling to lower selling prices.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Frequent Street Sales of Cotton Cloth The Industry Buys When Prices Are Low</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, with solid sentiment. Actual street sales were smooth and brisk, and transactions were the most frequent. Large quantities of white cloth bales were also shipped to inland wholesalers. Industry merchants still bought when prices were low. Stockholders took a wait-and-see attitude. The selling prices of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth were mostly stable. Small amounts of stock were cheap by 2 jiao 5 fen per piece. Street transactions included 1,000 pieces of velvet, gray cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth for spot and November and December futures. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and bleached and dyed cloth.</p>
<p>The Dongbu market presented a revolving situation. Leading fine cloth opened at 35 yuan 8 jiao. Subsequently, due to the fall in yarn prices, retailers sold off, so the price once fell to 35 yuan 4 jiao. However, the industry's sentiment remained firm, and the market tended to rise again, closing at 35 yuan 7 and a half jiao, unchanged from last weekend. Middle-grade colorful ball and other brands rose by 1 jiao 5 fen per piece due to actual sales needs. Four Gentlemen serge also rose by 2 li 5 hao due to tighter supply, with a closing price of 1 yuan 09 fen 5 hao.</p>
<h3>No Transportation Melton Sales Very Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen goods trading was booming in the street. The Nanjing merchants are now under strict inspection, and transportation companies are unwilling to take responsibility for collection and loading. Other merchants have also been unable to transport and purchase, so wholesale trading has declined recently, relying entirely on the street area. Sales of Melton cloth are sluggish. Merchants have needs but no way to transport. Street use finds the selling price expensive. Large batches of uniforms all specify domestic uniform cloth that costs less than 10 yuan. The cloth is too thin for coats, and trading has decreased by more than half compared to previous years. However, selling prices have not fallen. First-grade Yuanzang Melton sells for 15 yuan 5 jiao per yard, second-grade for 14 yuan 5 jiao, and third-grade for 13 yuan 7 jiao 5 hao.</p>
<h3>Oilcake Crude Oil Short Covering Turns Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's peanut oil market saw reduced supply, reduced spot inventory, and few futures positions. Trading in the market was mostly short covering, and long positions were firmly defended, so the market price turned upward. As a result, it surged by 1 yuan 5 jiao compared to last weekend. Crude oil remained level. Tongjin opened 400 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil (price details in the market price column), 200 barrels of Qingdao crude oil, 400 barrels for delivery in the lower half of November (priced at 104 yuan 2 jiao 5 hao to 105 yuan), 2,000 barrels for delivery in the lower half of December (priced at 105 yuan 7 jiao 5 hao to 106 yuan 7 jiao 5 hao), 50 pieces of Yantai crude oil, 130 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 40 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 35 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, several barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, and 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Sesame Oil Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>The destination for local sesame oil has always been mainly the Shantou and Guangzhou markets. This is because the people of Guangdong value cooking and like to use sesame oil in their dishes. Local sesame oil operators all transport it from the Bengbu area. Recently, the sesame oil market has seen sluggish sales due to the subdued appetite of merchants from Guangzhou. The market price has gradually fallen from 115 to 116 yuan per 100 catties (customary weight) to 107 to 108 yuan. The production price in Bengbu has also fallen from over 70 yuan (balance scale) to 65 to 66 yuan. There have been over 1,000 dan of goods arriving in Shanghai from Bengbu, so the market has not improved. It all depends on the appetite of the Guangzhou merchants. (Ju)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Granulated White Firm</h3>
<p>Although there was not much trading in the sugar market yesterday, the trend was still stable. The association quoted 73 yuan for spot 14 coarse white foreign goods, up 5 jiao; 56 yuan 6 jiao 5 hao to 5 jiao for spot Dutch red, up 2 jiao 5 hao to 1 jiao; 75 yuan 1 jiao for Taikoo granulated white B mark western warehouse, up 3 jiao; 75 yuan to 74 yuan 8 jiao for eastern warehouse, up 8 jiao; 69 yuan 5 hao for DY western warehouse, up 5 jiao; 69 yuan 2 jiao for HX mark.</p>
<h3>Coal Tongdeli White Coal</h3>
<p>Sales were brisk. Stockholders refused to sell stove white coal. Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, the source of supply was cut off in the past month, so various managers and merchants closed their doors and refused to sell, resulting in hoarding and speculation, and rising prices in the black market. In view of this, Bingshing Coal Industry Co., Ltd., which manages Tongdeli white coal, publicly sold to formal industry members to stabilize sentiment. The prices were 230 yuan per ton for Tongdeli No. 1, 2, and 3 lumps, 128 yuan for special lumps, and 170 yuan for ash. Stockholders' warehouse orders were generally rejected.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods Large Slices of Longan Meat Continue to Arrive in Small Quantities</h3>
<p>Since the new crop of large slices of longan meat has been available, the arrival of goods has not been large, but the market relies only on the needs of this street, and sales are narrow, so the market has softened and prices have fallen by 30 to 40 yuan. A small quantity arrived again yesterday, but the number was even smaller. In addition, Gulangyu has added special fees, which may harden the market.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Pangolin Scales Scarce Arrivals Prices Rebound by 10 to 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>After the previous easing in the pangolin scale market, there has been a lack of supply recently, and the original goods have been sold out, so prices have turned up, recovering by 10 to 20 yuan. Pangolin skin is level, with no significant fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Hardware Ribbed Steel Relaxes</h3>
<p>The ribbed steel bar market has been trending downward recently. Inland merchants have stopped purchasing, and street sales are sluggish, so the market is quiet and sentiment is weak. Yesterday's asking price was 1,100 yuan per ton for 3- to 4-point steel, and around 1,050 yuan for 5-point to 1-inch steel, both down by dozens of yuan from the previous price.</p>
<h3>Plain Galvanized Iron Still Expensive</h3>
<p>Trading of plain galvanized iron remains active. Local inventory is running out, so industry sentiment is very high, and the standard remains high. 7-foot iron is 9 yuan 5 jiao, and 6-foot iron is 8 yuan 2 jiao 5 hao.</p>
<h3>The Inappropriateness of Silver and Money Industry's Saturday Holiday Zhang Mengzhao</h3>
<p>Employees in the silver and money industry receive much better treatment than employees in any other industrial or commercial organization; (especially bank employees, who have huge allowances, such as rice allowances, coal allowances, and housing allowances, which are increased from the interest rate reduction of depositors to enrich the livelihoods of bank employees, "see Shou Junwen's article,") They have fixed office hours, (from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm,) and the daily working hours are only 7 hours or less! (Because after lunch, there is also a slight rest, so the actual work is probably less than 7 hours,) The work is leisurely and easy; occasionally, customers are crowded, but they are only busy for a moment. They have a public holiday every week and holidays on commemorative days. The lives of bank employees are truly what is called... leisurely and carefree, content with their situation! In terms of rights and obligations, they are relative. How much work is done, how much remuneration is received. However, in the phenomenon of Chinese industry and commerce, it is truly what the common saying says: "Hard work does not earn money, and earning money does not require hard work"! The manager signs, the director moves his mouth, and the lower-level employees are busy doing the most work, which is still within his decision. There are also those who hold the title of consultant or director, taking monthly travel expenses and dry salaries. As long as there is a powerful background, they take money and do nothing. It is commonplace. This is a common disease in Chinese industry and commerce. Now, the "silver and money industry has another unique and enjoyable move, and from January 1, next year (year 30), all will take a half-day holiday every Saturday. This is a selfish method of harming others and benefiting oneself, which hinders customer convenience and affects industrial and commercial business. The author, standing from the customer's point of view, believes that everyone knows that the business of most industrial and commercial firms on Saturday afternoons, and the collection and delivery of silver and money, are no less than Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, etc. Some, because of the special prosperity of business on Saturdays, the settlement and payment are far from being completed in time, and are all completed in the first half of Saturday. This is an iron fact. Also, everyone knows that Saturday afternoon is a day of sound, color, dogs, scolding, debauchery, and pleasure. Shanghai's diseases, such as horse racing, Jai Alai, playing marbles, gambling, opening hotels, dancing, movies, dramas, restaurants, and extravagant banquets, etc., fully unfold the absurd scene. It is precisely because of the half-day holiday on Saturday that it drives the silver and money industry employees to embark on the path of debauchery, extravagance, pride, luxury, and pleasure, which also has a very close and unfavorable impact on the silver and money industry itself. Some say that banks are closed on Sunday afternoons. This was implemented by foreign banks first. At that time, the Chinese banks on the Bund also closed because they joined the Foreign Bankers Association. However, in order to compete for business, they set up many branch offices, and like other Chinese banks, they were open as usual on Saturday afternoons. Now, it's just that general Chinese banks are following suit, so why be surprised and object suddenly! If you have funds to collect and deliver, you can come to the silver and money industry during business hours. The silver and money industry will never sacrifice its own enjoyment for the convenience of your industrial and commercial circles, and it is more than happy to have more than half a day off and less than half a day of risk. You can only speak to Chinese banks, and there is no need to do so. In fact, it is not entirely true. For one thing, foreign merchants and foreign firms have a shallow direct relationship with Chinese industry and commerce. Moreover, many foreign firms are also closed on Saturday afternoons. Both have this habit, and there is no harm to each other. But on the other hand, how do you know that it is not because foreign banks are closed on Saturday afternoons, making it inconvenient to collect and deliver funds, that foreign firms are also gradually closing! Since banks closed on Sundays in Shanghai, many money industries that have business dealings with banks have also closed. Do not think that in the early years of the industrial and commercial world, only a few exchanges were closed on Sundays. Now, industries such as the rice industry are also closed on Sundays. Could there have been such a situation in the heyday of the money industry and when banks first opened? Not to mention before, even a few years ago, in order to compete for business, banks allowed the branch offices that emphasized "savings" to remain open for half a day on Sundays. Now that the silver and money industry has become wealthy and deposits are crowded, there is no need for any competition. Therefore, some employees in the industry do not know the overall situation and "have eyes on the top of their heads." They do not know where the business of the silver and money industry comes from. Instead, they use a copper-faced face to deal with customers in a big and arrogant manner. They are truly ignorant and self-important, ridiculous and pitiful. They do not think that finance is the mother of all industries. Once finance is stopped, all industries will be affected, and they will be forced to close as well. Because of the impact of the related closures, the loss of time and money is unknown in the dark. It is truly unimaginable that the silver and money industry only seeks its own enjoyment and forgets to support the great work of industry and commerce. In this era of resistance and construction, it is time for all industries to bury their heads and work hard; "45 days a month" is still not enough. However, the employees of the silver and money industry, at this critical juncture, not only do not come out to advocate for more work, but instead exhaust their efforts to increase the number of rest days. What is their motive!</p>

<h3>Cooperation Between the Two Concessions to Hold a Safety Campaign Begins; Chinese and Foreign Citizens Participate and Promote It; Enthusiastic Publicity Expands Everywhere</h3>
<p>Following the first "Safety Campaign" held by the two concessions on June 18th of last year, due to its remarkable success and the clear reduction in accidental incidents, it was decided to continue the campaign. After several weeks of preparation, the second "Safety Week Safety Campaign" began yesterday. Throughout the city, leaflets and slogans were posted, actively promoting the campaign and urging citizens to pay attention. Police officers from both concessions were also dispatched to assist in directing traffic at major intersections. Various sectors of the city also participated in assisting, and the atmosphere throughout the day was enthusiastic and the order was good. This campaign will last for fourteen days starting yesterday. The authorities will carry out publicity and guidance work every day, and will send personnel to inspect the results at any time. With the joint promotion of all citizens, it is expected that this campaign will achieve even better results, further reducing accidental incidents.</p>
<p>Warning Slogans Hung in Major Thoroughfares</p>
<p>In order to ensure widespread attention to the safety campaign, the authorities of the two concessions yesterday hung eye-catching white cloth banners donated on major thoroughfares and intersections. The Public Concession had seven locations with the four characters "Safety First." The French Concession had ten locations with slogans such as "Look Left and Right Clearly When Crossing Intersections" and "Do Not Let Children Play in the Streets." These attracted considerable attention from pedestrians. In addition, all private cars, buses, trams, rickshaws, and handcarts in the city automatically displayed triangular flags yesterday. Walls along important roads and shop windows were also decorated with concise and striking illustrations and slogans to expand publicity.</p>
<p>Police Guidance at Intersections</p>
<p>Intersections are where the most accidents occur. For this reason, the police departments of the two concessions specially dispatched all police officers to increase their presence at intersections within the concessions yesterday, with two to six officers at each location, to assist the original patrol officers in directing traffic. They also ensured that pedestrians must proceed along the pedestrian lanes when the green light is on, and may not cross the road at will. As a result, the order at each intersection was good and the danger was greatly reduced. The pedestrian crossing lines and "Stop" signs for vehicles at each intersection had faded in many places due to age. The Works Department specially dispatched artisans to repaint them at each intersection yesterday morning, further increasing their visibility.</p>
<p>Film Screenings, Broadcasts, and Lectures</p>
<p>The entertainment industry in the city, entrusted by the authorities, added publicity programs yesterday. All first-run cinemas screened a seven-minute "Safety Campaign" short film, and second-run cinemas screened a fifteen-minute feature film. It is reported that the Public Works Department has produced a total of six short and long films for free screening in various cinemas. Yesterday, the electrical inspector of the Public Works Department gave a broadcast lecture on Western Radio, while Chinese radio stations broadcast safety records. In entertainment programs, broadcasters added warning phrases to instill in listeners an understanding of the "Safety Campaign."</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Students Promoting Everywhere</p>
<p>After negotiations by the authorities, eighteen middle schools mobilized to promote the "Safety Campaign" yesterday, with a thousand students. Yesterday, they were led by personnel dispatched by the authorities and divided into groups on Nanjing Road, Avenue Edward VII, and Avenue Joffre, distributing leaflets, telling pedestrians the meaning of the "Safety Campaign," and correcting shortcomings in walking habits. They all wore armbands and were enthusiastic in performing their duties, which was admirable. Yesterday, the concession authorities specially distributed printed lecture notes to various schools in the city for teachers to use in class. All schools complied, so the students' impressions were particularly profound. Also yesterday, the Public Works Department specially sent two staff members to tea houses, entertainment venues, and public places within the concession to lecture on the meaning of the "Safety Campaign." There were many listeners.</p>
<p>The First Implementation Has Achieved Great Results</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yao Jiakun, the person in charge of the Vehicle Department of the Public Works Department Police, there are many residents in the two concessions, and the streets are busy with vehicles, so incidents of trouble occur frequently. In the year before last, there were 15,813 road accident cases, resulting in 123 deaths and 4,953 injuries. Last June, the first safety campaign was launched, and as a result, the number of accident cases decreased to 13,892, with 227 deaths and 4,937 injuries. It was originally planned to cooperate with the French police authorities again this June to implement the campaign for the second time, but due to the uncertain situation, it was delayed until now. It is expected that the results of this campaign will be even better than before.</p>
<p>Ten Commandments for Pedestrians That Should Be Strictly Observed</p>
<p>The rules that pedestrians should pay attention to are as follows: (1) Walk on the sidewalk when walking; (2) Do not cross the road at intersections, cross the road at pedestrian crossings; (3) Avoid walking in the same direction as vehicles on the curb; (4) Walk on the left side of the curb; (5) Cross the road straight, do not cross diagonally; (6) Be especially careful when passing in front of or behind vehicles; (7) Do not stop on the road; (8) Do not call for a rickshaw on the opposite side of the road; (9) If there is no pedestrian crossing, look left and right clearly before crossing the road; (10) When a vehicle is about to drive across the road, do not rush across the road.</p>
<p>The YMCA Produced a Film</p>
<p>The film group of the National Association of the YMCA in this city, in order to cooperate with the authorities to reduce traffic accidents, specially produced forty-five film strips under the guidance of Deputy Inspector Fernada of the Police Department. Most of them are about vehicle accidents and children suffering, which will be screened in YMCA's throughout the country. Most of the films are now borrowed by Mr. Ma Fuli, Director of the Vehicle Department of the French Municipal Council, for screening in cinemas within the concession first.</p>
<h3>Four Accountants Request Departmental Reorganization; Change to Limited Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association's member money shops, commonly known as "exchange shops," total forty-one. Of these, the Welfare and Jinyuan shops are newly established after the war, organized as limited liability companies. Recently, the industry has seen that money shops organized as limited companies are in line with the trend, and it is reported that several others, such as Xinzong, are being prepared, with capital ranging from 500,000 to 1 million yuan. They have applied to the Ministry of Finance for registration, and will open for business as soon as the business license is approved and issued.</p>
<h3>Unification of Principal and Interest of Various Bonds; Lottery to Be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>The tenth redemption of principal of the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Public Bonds has been carried out by the National Debt Fund Management Committee since August of this year, dividing bond tickets into five types, A, B, C, D, and E, with monthly lotteries for redemption of principal. Now the winning numbers for bond tickets of types A, B, C, and D have been drawn, and type E is scheduled for December 10th. After all five types of bond tickets have been completely drawn, principal and interest will be repaid starting January 31st of next year. An agreement has been reached with the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, and the four banks will discount and pay at that time. In Shanghai, payments will be made in six installments. The paying agencies are the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications entrusted by it.</p>
<h3>Citywide Promotion of Safety Campaign</h3>
<p>The safety campaign jointly organized by the Public Concession and the French Concession was launched yesterday with enthusiastic publicity. Chinese and foreign citizens participated and promoted it together. (Top) is a large banner across the two concessions on Avenue Edward VII. (Bottom) is a street propaganda team distributing leaflets. (Photographed by Kang Zuyi)</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Sends Letter to Municipal Council on Present Funding of Pingyao; The Seventh Term of Pingyao Ends Today, Causing Concern Among the Poor</h3>
<p>The soaring rice prices have greatly threatened the lives of ordinary citizens, and the future of security within the concession is also a cause for concern. The current sale of subsidized rice will be sold out today (the 19th). The Public Works Department of the Public Concession, in view of this, submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors, which was passed at the regular meeting of the Board of Directors last Wednesday, resolving to continue the matter. According to Pingming News, the Public Works Department has decided to send a letter to the Municipal Council seeking cooperation on the matter of providing present funding to rice industry groups to facilitate the continued operation of Pingyao, hoping that the Municipal Council will, like the Public Works Department, provide present funding to enable Pingyao to continue to operate. This will not only allow ordinary citizens to barely make a living, but will also greatly benefit the future of security within the concession, and will also stabilize rice prices. Since receiving encouragement from the Public Works Department, the Pingyao Association also intends to convene a general meeting within days to discuss the continuation of the eighth term of Pingyao.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Order Gradually Restored; Many Suspects Captured; Japan Actually Accuses the Concession of Indifference; Chinese Woman Shot Has Died in Hospital</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that at around 1:00 PM on the 16th of this month, Japanese Sergeant Tominaga Mitsugu was assassinated in front of the Japanese Club on Peng Road. The Japanese immediately sealed off all bridges over the Suzhou Creek entering the northern district of the Public Concession for more than a day, and only reopened them today (the 18th). Hongkou has returned to normal. Japanese newspapers this morning said that the Japanese marines had conducted a major search in the Hongkou district since the 16th, which was completed yesterday (the 17th), and more than fifteen suspects have been captured and are being interrogated. According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," the Japanese military seized several handguns and bullets from the suspects. The newspaper also stated, "In view of the repeated shooting incidents in the Hongkou district, the two concession authorities are indifferent." It is possible that the Japanese side will hold political consultations with the two concession authorities.</p>
<p>Five People Shot, One Woman Dies</p>
<p>The "Continental Times" reported that on the 16th of this month, Japanese Sergeant Tominaga Mitsugu was assassinated on Wusong Road. The Japanese immediately sealed off all bridges over the Suzhou Creek, cutting off traffic. At 9:00 PM that night, a Japanese marine soldier on the Zhapu Road Bridge shot and injured five Chinese. The Public Concession Fire Brigade dispatched an ambulance to the rescue after receiving the news, but was intercepted by the Japanese side. All the injured were taken away by the Japanese side. One of the women, whose name is unknown, is said to have died in the hospital yesterday (the 17th). It is rumored that a crowd of Chinese gathered on the Zhapu Road Bridge on the night of the 16th, wanting to enter Hongkou, and were shot several times by Japanese sentries, resulting in five injuries. However, the situation described by reliable foreigners who witnessed the incident differs. According to reports, the Japanese sentry made a ready posture, pointed the rifle, and accidentally pulled the trigger, firing a bullet. The Chinese waiting on the sidewalk, whether squatting or standing, were injured by the bullet. The bullet first penetrated the abdomen of the first person, injured the thigh of the second person, then penetrated the chest of the third person who was leaning forward slightly, and further injured the leg of the fourth person. Finally, it entered the neck of a woman and did not come out. The woman who died from her injuries was this woman.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Panic, Form Vigilante Corps</p>
<p>Japanese residents in Hongkou, because of the continuous series of bloody cases occurring in their tightly guarded areas, are not only in danger themselves, but also expose the inadequacy of their defense capabilities. Therefore, Japanese residents plan to form a vigilante corps and contact the Japanese Telegraph Company to avoid being attacked again. Mr. Hayashi, Chairman of the "Various Roads Joint Association" of the Japanese in Hongkou, consulted the Captain of the Japanese Military Police in Ura on this matter the day before yesterday. Mr. Miura expressed his full agreement and convened an executive meeting at 1:00 PM that afternoon. As a result, the members of the Various Roads Joint Association were used as basic members to form a vigilante corps. If a security incident occurs in their area, they will immediately notify each other. Detailed plans will be convened at a meeting of district chiefs at the Japanese Club on the afternoon of the 21st. Stores and schools are also planning to work together to build defense works to prevent unforeseen events.</p>
<h3>Protest Against Detention of the Meilun; Japan Will Reply</h3>
<p>The American-owned Dasheng Madalun ship, which was carrying passengers and goods from Liqun Port in Zhejiang Province to Shanghai on the 2nd of this month, was detained by the Japanese side and has been detained for two weeks. Mr. Lockhart, the American Consul General in Shanghai, has protested to the Japanese side twice, but the Japanese side has not yet given a formal reply. Yesterday, it was learned that the Japanese Consulate had indicated informally that the Japanese Navy Department was studying the protest documents submitted by the American side and claimed to be preparing to reply in the next few days. Therefore, the American Consulate is still waiting for the Japanese side's reply before making a statement.</p>

<h3>American Ship Armont Leaves Shanghai for the Philippines This Morning; Marine Corps Deployment Has Been Called Off; The United States Sends a Large Number of Air Force Personnel to the Philippines for Reinforcement; Evacuation Ship Scheduled to Carry Nationals South Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The American Navy's Asia Fleet transport ship Armont arrived in Shanghai on the 14th of this month and berthed at the British Navy pontoon on the Yangjingbang Pu side. As reported previously, it is now learned that the transport ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Philippines this morning. (Reports in various newspapers that it was going to the Philippines yesterday were incorrect.) As for the claim that a part of the Shanghai Marine Corps would be taken to the Philippines, it was claimed by those close to the American Navy yesterday that the deployment of a part of the Marine Corps to the Philippines has now been temporarily called off. However, a part of the naval officers' families, about 70 people, and more than 10 retired soldiers, will take the transport ship to the Philippines and return to the United States.</p>
<p>Air Force Personnel Pass Through Shanghai to the Philippines</p>
<p>The ship Washington arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 17th), carrying 177 American Air Force personnel, who passed through Shanghai to Manila to strengthen the defenses of the Philippine Islands. The group includes drivers, sergeants, and mechanics, who are part of the 17th Fighter Squadron of the American Air Force stationed on the island of the Philippines. The aircraft they will be driving, estimated at one hundred, are the newest types of fighters that the United States recently intended to transport to Sweden, but whose export permit was revoked by the US government and instead used for its own use. They will all be stationed at the Manila airfield.</p>
<p>Permission Granted Yesterday to Go Ashore for Sightseeing</p>
<p>The group of Air Force personnel was not allowed to leave the ship when they arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but permission was granted yesterday (the 18th) to go ashore for sightseeing. However, more than 200 crew members of the Washington were allowed to go ashore the day before yesterday, and a small number of them who had been to Shanghai before and crew members of the American President Lines led them to tour the city.</p>
<p>The Ship Washington Will Leave Tomorrow</p>
<p>The last American evacuation ship, the Washington, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 20th. There are 500 Americans from Shanghai taking the ship back to the United States, including 40 men. This is more than the number of Shanghai American men carried by the previous two evacuation ships, but the rest are women and children, including many wives and children of American naval personnel stationed in Shanghai. The Washington can carry a maximum of 1,600 passengers, but the total number of evacuees it will carry back to the United States on this trip to the Far East is only 1,200. In addition, most of the wives of American Christian missionaries in various parts of China have decided to leave Shanghai within the next two months, and the first group will also take the Washington from Shanghai back to the United States.</p>
<p>Two Staff Members Highly Regarded</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that there are several noteworthy figures on the ship Washington, including the ship's steward, Ginsburg, who is a well-known athlete, and Quinlan Brasher, who possesses one of the two oldest newspapers published in the United States, which contains a record of the death of the first American president, George Washington. One copy of the newspaper is now on display at the newly established Federal Museum and is insured for $20,000.</p>

<h3>Huangpu River Dredging Expanded</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of the Huangpu River dredging in the spring of this year, the scale of the dredging has been very small because most of the dredgers are still detained by the Japanese side. Recently, the dredgers Haili, Haibao, Haihu, etc. have been released, and the survey ships Lilian and Lijiang have also been returned one after another. Therefore, the General Dredging Bureau has decided to start large-scale dredging on the 1st of next month. The area is very wide, including the upper, middle, and lower sections of the Huangpu River and the upper section of the Wusong River. The Bureau has no intention of resuming the completion of the Kobe at the mouth of the Wusong River in the shortest possible time, because in the current environment, the completion there is not necessary.</p>
<h3>British Naval Authorities Requisitioned Two British Ships to Transport Supplies to the Far East Base</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in French Vietnam, it announced the suspension of any ships calling at the port. All British merchant ships connecting to Shanghai have been diverted to other routes, and French merchant ships have replaced them. British merchant ships have been greatly affected. Currently, they only operate on the Hong Kong and Beiyang routes, and some ships have been ordered to switch to other routes. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the Taishan and Desheng ships, which originally operated between Shanghai and Fangjian, have now been ordered by the British authorities to be temporarily requisitioned by the Naval Authorities. The Desheng ship was requisitioned by the British military in May of this year to load evacuated British soldiers, and once came to Shanghai before operating on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route. Recently, it and the Taishan ship have been requisitioned to transport military supplies to the Far East base. They will not return to Shanghai in the short term.</p>
<h3>Mr. Howard's Visit to Shanghai: An Analysis of the Indian Political Situation (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Mr. Edwin Haward, former editor of the Shanghai-based North-China Daily News and currently a consultant on Indian affairs, recently arrived in Shanghai after a visit to India. He has published an article entitled "An Analysis of the Indian Political Situation," and we hereby record its original text as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese public opinion generally expresses sympathy for the political views of the Indian people, which is inevitable. Indeed, the Chinese people have long regarded the abolition of unequal treaties as their mission, and therefore find it easier to be moved by struggles for independence and the removal of the shackles of foreign forces. When the Indian National Congress refused to cooperate with the British government, the Chinese people here all voiced their sympathy. However, the Indian problem is by no means as simple as German and anti-British propaganda imagines. We believe that the British government will find it difficult to defend the policies passed by the House of Commons. In fact, the political situation in India is very complex, and the misunderstandings of general public opinion are due to a lack of clear understanding. Here is a brief analysis of the political situation in India.</p>
<p>Since the 1937 elections, the National Congress, the largest and most organized party in the eleven provinces of British India, has held eight of them. Although this party does not have an institution for drafting a constitution, it has the power to express its opinions on foreign affairs through its executive body, the All-India Congress Committee. The leaders of the party strongly opposed the dictators of Fascism and Nazism. It is still remembered that when the British government failed to fully assist Abyssinia, they issued condemnations. They also demanded that the British government adopt a proactive policy of aiding China in its war efforts. They were also dissatisfied with the British government's attitude towards Spain. However, when the European war broke out, the National Congress divided its forces and opposed India's participation in the war. Despite the Indian Governor-General's painstaking persuasion, they still instigated representatives from various states to resign in protest. The only reasons they gave were that India did not have the ability to make its own decisions and that the British war objectives failed to satisfy the Indian people. Most of the representatives did not enthusiastically support this order, but they were forced to express their agreement due to party rules. The eight provinces that opposed participation in the war were Assam, Bihar, Bombay, the Central Provinces, Madras, the North-West Frontier Provinces, Orissa, and the United Provinces. The other three provinces, Punjab, Bengal, and Sindh, unanimously advocated assisting the British in the war. When this matter first arose, the British government did its best to appease and encourage the National Congress, aiming to expand the Governor-General's cabinet to accommodate suggestions from representatives of various parties. It was even proposed at one point, but without result, the rift deepened. As a result, the National Congress declared that it would refuse to support the British war effort by "non-violent means," led by Gandhi. However, although the National Congress is the most organized political party, it cannot be regarded as the only political institution in India, because it does not represent the 50 million people of the oppressed classes, namely the Hindu and Muslim populations. For various reasons, the Muslim support for the National Congress has gradually decreased. As a result, the All-India Muslim League, under the leadership of Jinnah, has recently publicly opposed the Congress. The governors of Punjab, Bengal, and Sindh are all Muslims and have supported the British government's war effort from the beginning. Of the 338 million people in India, 239 million are Hindus, 77 million are Muslims, and 4 million are Sikhs. All religions originally cooperated with the National Congress, but since the outbreak of the war, the Sikhs have leaned towards Punjab, partly due to military tradition, but mostly due to fears that the British government would reduce the number of Sikhs serving in the military. The attitude of the Punjab provincial government is extremely important, as 62% of the Indian army comes from that province. Therefore, the Muslims of Punjab are the backbone of the Indian army. This decision by the National Congress has greatly weakened its power to govern India, because during the war, the central government still has the support of provinces with abundant manpower and resources, while liberals, Muslims, oppressed classes, and Sikhs are now cooperating with the National Congress. The Muslim League has taken a key position in the National Congress's obstinate actions, and the Indian side is also quite surprised. Indian merchants originally sympathized with the National Congress's plans, but the development of Indian wartime industry has led them to oppose the National Congress's eccentric demands. However, what the British government cannot ignore is that, after a prolonged period, the National Congress will still occupy an important position in Indian politics, and the party's refusal to cooperate with the Governor-General is indeed a major stain.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks Austerity, Revises Employee Terms, Special Committee Formed for Research, Elimination of Favorable Leave Policies to be Considered</h3>
<p>It is recently learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially established a subcommittee to study and revise the terms of employment of Council staff, in order to continue to seek austerity in next year's budget. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Council, Mr. Nash, confirmed yesterday morning (the 18th) that this subcommittee has been established, but stated that he could not disclose the details of the matter until the committee submits its report to the Council.</p>
<p>Subcommittee to Submit Recommendations</p>
<p>It is understood that the subcommittee is composed of taxpayers from various countries who have withdrawn from the International Settlement, with Reverend Bowden as chairman and Mr. Leeson, Assistant Secretary-General of the Council, as secretary. The members include Mr. Jarriau, Mr. Powell, Mr. R. ToyoKawa, Mr. D.S. Chen, and Mr. Tie Lin Nanqi. Officials have only disclosed the name of the new committee as a "Shanghai Municipal Council Special Austerity Committee Terms of Service Subcommittee." It is reported that the committee may submit a preliminary report in late this month. As for what kind of revisions the committee may recommend, Council officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>Fixed Salary Scale, Elimination of Privileges</p>
<p>However, some people speculate that the terms of employment for Council staff will be fully revised next year, and believe that the committee will ask the Council to set standards for the existing salary ranges of all employees, so as to abolish the existing preferential treatment such as leave on principle. One opinion is that the subcommittee may not be able to obtain any valuable resolutions to improve the economic situation of the Council, because abolishing the preferential treatment of employees will affect the overall situation and cause many employees to resign.</p>
<h3>Nine-Year-Old Student Wu Zude Kidnapped on Way to School, Studying at the Municipal Council's Fourth Primary School, Bandits Seize Two Cars to Carry Out Kidnapping, Police Open Fire in Pursuit but Fail to Capture Them</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a kidnapping case occurred at the intersection of Route Ghisi and Route Keane in western Shanghai. The victim was Wu Zude (乳名菊兒, nicknamed Ju'er, nine years old), a student at the Municipal Council's Fourth Primary School. At 7:40 yesterday morning, four kidnappers, each armed with firearms, drove to the intersection of Route Ghisi and Route Keane in two cars with white license plates, numbers 18021 and 18182. They parked the two cars in advance by the roadside and then kidnapped Wu Zude, a student from the Butterfly Village Municipal Council's Fourth Primary School on Route Brenan, as he passed by. At the time, three Chinese detectives from the Public Concession, numbers 114, etc., saw what was happening and stepped forward to stop the car. However, the car sped away, and the detectives opened fire once as a warning, but the bandit car still escaped at high speed. It was later learned that the kidnapped Wu Zude is the eldest son of Wu Qichang, a local who works at the Chinese Cloth Exchange, and lives at 105 Route Ghisi. He was accompanied by a family member, Qian Fuqu, before the incident, but was unexpectedly kidnapped on the way. Further investigation by the police revealed that the cars used by the kidnappers were stolen. It turns out that two customers, one in a Western suit and one in Chinese attire, went to the Huali Automobile Company at 617 Jiujiang Road at 3:06 yesterday morning to hire a car. The company sent out car number 18021, driven by the driver Chen Zhengcai, who followed instructions to Route Brenan. Unexpectedly, when the car arrived at the road, the two passengers drew their guns and drove Chen out of the car, driving away. Another car, number 18182, belongs to the Carter Automobile Company at 732 Route Picard, and was rented at 6:25 yesterday morning by a man in a black long gown who said he was going to the North Railway Station. He temporarily changed his instructions in the car and told the driver to go to Route Yu Ding Pan. He also drove the driver off in the middle of the road and escaped. Car number 18021 was later found at the intersection of Route Brenan and Route Lou Lang, while car number 18182 was found at the intersection of Route Xiaoshadu and Route Robertison at about 10 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Citibank Employee Dies, Wives Dispute Inheritance, Father in Charge Opposes Division, Court Orders Both Parties to Reconcile Outside</h3>
<p>Xu Fuchang, a local employee of Citibank, died of illness on September 21 last year. The bank authorities granted a pension of US$1,250. Xu had one wife and one concubine. The wife, named Fu Ying, is a local and has one daughter, named Zhaolin. The concubine, Xiao, has five children, namely Rongquan, Rongbao, Yongming, Gaorong, and Fuzhen. Xu had been living with Xiao, while his first wife lived separately. Therefore, after Xu's death, all the inheritance was managed by his concubine and his father. Xu's first wife and eldest daughter recently retained lawyer Li Ming to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special Court, requesting that Xu Xiao and others be ordered to hand over all of Xu Fuchang's inheritance and divide it into seven shares, and the mother and daughter requested to receive two-sevenths. Xu Fuchang left behind property: (1) Savings of the Citibank employee totaling 11,680 national currency units. (2) Citibank pension of US$1,250. (3) Several deposits in the International Savings Society. (4) Five shares of Citibank stock. In terms of real estate, there are eleven land deeds for numbers 8883, 8890, 895, 9932, and 9935 in Yinxiang Township. There is a lot of real estate. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Gui, who summoned Xu Xiao and others to the third civil court. The defendants Xu Xiao and others appointed lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appear in court. The plaintiff Fu Ying, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared and stated that Xu Fuchang was the plaintiff's husband, and the second plaintiff was Xu Zhaolin's father. Regarding the cash and deposits left by Xu Fuchang, the plaintiff mother and daughter requested to receive 20,000 yuan. As for real estate such as houses and land, they will be divided later. Then Xu Zixiang, Xu Fuchang's father, appeared and stated that after Fuchang's death, all property was managed by him. He expressed dissatisfaction with the媳婦 (daughter-in-law, Fu Ying) and孫女 (granddaughter, Zhaolin) demanding a division. Judge Gui then said to Xu Zixiang: Xu Fuchang's inheritance, the plaintiff mother and daughter both have the right to inherit under the law and should be given to them. The lawyers for both parties then stated to the court that there might be hope for a settlement in this case. The court then advised the plaintiff and Xu Zixiang and others at length, telling them not to litigate as a family. The case was adjourned to November 19 for another hearing. During the adjournment, it is hoped that both parties can reach a settlement. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Gang of Robbers Hidden in Hotel, Ten Criminals Arrested, Four Pistols Confiscated</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the French Police Department suddenly received a tip-off that a large number of robbers were hiding in rooms 7, 8, and 16 of the New Life Hotel in Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao, with the intention of committing crimes. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, fully armed, to the scene in police cars, deployed around Hengmao Lane, and surrounded the New Life Hotel (while several plainclothes detectives went inside to search). Unexpectedly, the robbers were awakened from their sleep and scattered onto the roof to escape, opening fire to resist arrest. The detectives then fired back, and bullets flew like beads. As a result, one robber was hit in the leg on the roof and captured. At the same time, a total of ten robbers, including Chen Xifa, were arrested in rooms 7, 8, and 16, as well as in the garbage bins at the entrance of the lane. The tea house worker of the hotel, Wu Ligen, was also arrested. Four pistols and stolen goods were confiscated on the spot and taken to the police station. The injured person was first sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and the remaining robbers are currently being investigated at the police station.</p>
<h3>Bandits Attempt to Rob Pistol, Exchange Gunfire, One Detective Narrowly Escapes Death, Bandits Secretly Flee</h3>
<p>At 4:00 a.m. yesterday morning, two Chinese detectives, numbers 956 and 842, from the Foch Police Station in the French Concession were on duty at the intersection of Route Ferguson and Route Courbet when a man in short clothes came up to chat, saying that there were robbers nearby, luring the two detectives to a nearby wasteland. Three men with two pistols were lying in ambush there. When the two detectives walked over, they shouted to stop and not move. The two detectives knew that these people were not good and were trying to rob their official pistols. Detective 956 reached for his chest, intending to draw his gun and fire, but the bandits fired first at the detective. The bullet hit the gun bullet shell on the abdomen of number 956, fortunately without injury. The detectives and bandits then exchanged several shots, but because it was dark, none of them hit. The bandits disappeared in an instant and their whereabouts are unknown. The two detectives then returned to the police station to report the situation.</p>

When the tram arrived at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road, a lady who was on the tram got off. When the tram started, the lady suddenly remembered that she had forgotten something on the tram. She wanted to go up and get it, but the tram had already started and it was too late. She shouted from behind, but no one could hear her. The tram number is 391 and the ticket seller is number 884. This thing has been handed over to the ticket seller for safekeeping. Please ask this lady to go to the tram company to collect it. I hope that readers will be careful not to forget their belongings when taking the tram in the future.</p>

<h3>"The Insulted and Injured"</h3>
<p>— Li Fang</p>
<p>In this society, it is really not easy to be a woman, and you encounter trouble and distress everywhere. You may think: as long as you don't get married, you won't have much misfortune, right? But who says that's true? Take me, for example. I am an unmarried twenty-year-old girl. My father and mother are both well-educated, they give me freedom in everything, respect my opinions, and the home is full of harmony and peace. I am quite pretty, and the boys all look at me with admiring and well-meaning eyes. Naturally, it seems that I should be a happy and fortunate person; but no, it's not like that at all, I have my troubles. Just taking a walk, I encounter many disasters, although these troubles are subtle, they are more than enough to bear.</p>
<p>I am an "insulted and injured" person. Please see my complaint.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school, I was only seventeen years old. Once I was waiting for the tram, and a large truck loaded with mud bricks drove by, packed with workers. Of course, there was nothing surprising about this, but misfortune struck. Suddenly, a large pile of mud was thrown on my head, shoulders, and body, followed by a burst of crude laughter. The truck carried the laughter away, leaving behind only the insulted me. Yes, I understand: all the misfortunes—the more unbearable misfortunes—are surrounding me, just because I am already a grown-up, beautiful girl.</p>
<p>After that, I was always alert, defending myself, but I continued to receive distress.</p>
<p>Sometimes, walking past a shop, a thick gob of phlegm would fly over like a dart. Sometimes the "dart" hits near you—not hitting, that's considered lucky; sometimes it is spat on your clothes, splashing on your face; you look at the counter, sometimes the hero has slipped away, but sometimes he still sits calmly and unconcerned on the counter, as if to say: "What's wrong with you? Can't I spit?" Sometimes they even say proudly: "Ah! Miss, sorry, dirtied your clothes. Do you want me to wash them for you?" If you are walking past a store selling old clothes, the tricks are even fresher. The clerks will shake out a pair of pants and shake them on your head, shouting, "Hey, two dollars and twenty-eight cents, two pigtails (if you are wearing two pigtails on your head), a big sister..." Ugh, do you want to negotiate? Forget it, you will only receive even greater insult.</p>
<p>That's not the end of it, there's more! This kind of situation happens most often in the summer when wearing thin clothes. Sometimes, you are walking along just fine, and a hand will grope, pinch, or even twist your bare arm. Of course, I only say that this kind of situation is easy to encounter in hot weather, not that it never happens in winter; the arms are covered with clothes, but wouldn't the same happen if they touched your chest? All kinds of people play this kind of hero, but the most are students who wear shiny pointed leather shoes and have shiny hair. Of course, it seems too disrespectful to young students to say this, but what can I do, I am telling the truth! I am one who often sees the shiny pointed leather shoes moving over from afar and quickly avoids them.</p>
<p>There are even more frightening things. Sometimes, as you are walking, a strong hand grabs your shoulder. When you turn around, it is the face of an Indian Asan, tall and big, with a black face and a mouth full of white teeth, making you feel scared, surprised, and annoyed.</p>
<p>I am an "insulted and injured" person, but I know that this is an educational problem, a unique and inevitable phenomenon under this social system. I know that the insults I have suffered are not the greatest insults, but I am not sad, I am not afraid, I have the courage to fight, I want to personally participate in the funeral of this society.</p>
<h3>Heaven has a road, but no way into the earth.</h3>
<p>— Ma Gezuo</p>
<p>Hawthorn Detective Story</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>"As I walked along Zhaotong Road, I suddenly saw Li Zhifan coming towards me from the north end of Datong Road. He was followed by two people. I thought it was a coincidence and was about to cross Qingpu Road to greet him. Unexpectedly, just at that moment, I saw the two people behind him suddenly rush forward to stop him, as if they wanted to demand something from him. The three of them wrestled together. Then, two gunshots rang out, and Li Zhifan fell at the corner of Datong Road. The two men then turned around and fled north on Datong Road. I didn't expect this unexpected incident, so I turned around and retreated towards the end of Datong Road. I didn't expect that you had already sent plainclothes detectives to guard there. For caution, I took a few more detours before returning to Huanghe Road. Unexpectedly, that thin man was very alert. I looked back several times along the way and still saw his shadow. However, this person is useful to me. If you have any doubts about me in this matter, I think he can be a witness for me."</p>
<p>I wondered if he was really completely unrelated to the attack on Li Zhifan. If what he said was true, this matter would be quite troublesome. Who attacked Li Zhifan? According to Zhao Boxiong, there were two other people. What kind of people are these two? We have no clues at the moment.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said with a stern face: "Zhao Boxiong, in this matter, from a legal standpoint, you should be punished accordingly. However, this woman is a scourge of society and a criminal of the country. If we consider your duties, it should be treated differently. However, in terms of your duties, your actions were improper, and you cannot escape appropriate punishment."</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong stood up again, bowed respectfully, and said in a low voice: "Mr. Hawthorne, I accept your instructions. I myself know my mistake. Now I am ready to accept any punishment you give me."</p>
<p>Hawthorne also stood up, tossed the small knife he was playing with onto the desk, and said casually: "The power of punishment is not in my hands. This is my opinion, and also a warning to you. You may leave. I think you will naturally know soon what kind of punishment you should receive." (170)</p>

<h3>Reunion</h3>
<p>— Ying Jin</p>
<p>It is rare for us to have such a gathering.</p>
<p>After leaving school, we were pushed into the doors of society one after another, but space separates us, making it rare for us to meet. Some old classmates have never met since.</p>
<p>Today, we unexpectedly reunited. When I received Cuijin's call, asking me to participate in this gathering, what an excited and excited mood I was in! The faces of those old classmates kept appearing in my mind, and the film of memory replayed some of the interesting things between us...</p>
<p>Finally, we met in a quiet room. There was little formality, and in such a suitable environment, we started lively conversations. Everyone poured out their hearts without any restraint. Even if there had been disputes in school before, they now seemed to have forgotten them and appeared particularly close.</p>
<p>During the conversation, I scrutinized the facial contours of those old classmates, but I couldn't see any major changes! But from their conversation, demeanor, and criticism of everything they have experienced in this dynamic era, I sensitively felt the rapid progress of their thinking.</p>
<p>As if it had been agreed in advance, they hated the "Seven Seas": hated the extravagant and dissolute lives of those high-class Chinese, the acts of manipulation and exploitation, hated the scarlet sky of the "root of evil" at night, and also hated all the material facilities that were designed for the rich...</p>
<p>These are all things that I myself have felt and often spoken about. Today, hearing them from the mouths of those old classmates feels particularly亲切. These few years have not been a very long time, but the simple minds of the past in school now have such profound understanding!</p>
<p>——Society is a big school, and the events that everyone experiences are good living textbooks, aren't they?</p>
<p>If I were to compare my daily life to drinking plain water, then today I drank a cup of strong coffee.</p>

<h3>Record of the Five Major Directors of the Film City This Year</h3>
<p>— He La</p>
<p>Hollywood's "Movie Express" recently held a readership intelligence test for the five best directors of the year. According to the magazine, it was recently founded but has a huge sales volume among American students, so the standard of the decision test has been greatly improved, because it must not only consider the artistic value of the director, but also be based on his usual personality and ideological cultivation. The magazine announced the list of the five best directors of 1940 as follows:</p>
<p>(1) William Dieterle, works such as "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "Juarez", "The Story of Louis Pasteur", "The Life of Emile Zola", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", "Anthony Adverse", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", "The Life of Emile Zola", "Anthony Adverse", "The Man in the Iron Mask".</p>
<p>(2) John Ford, works such as "The Informer", "Stagecoach", "Young Mr. Lincoln", "The Hurricane", "The Grapes of Wrath", "Brigham Young" and so on.</p>
<p>(3) Frank Capra, works such as "Lost Horizon", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", "You Can't Take It with You", "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", and so on.</p>
<p>(4) Michael Curtiz, works such as "The Adventures of Robin Hood", "Four Daughters", "Four Wives", "The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex", "Dodge City", and so on.</p>
<p>(5) Edmund Goulding, works such as "Dark Victory", "The Old Maid", "The Great Lie", "Till We Meet Again", and so on.</p>
<p>The first three directors are very progressive in their thinking. They are dissatisfied with the current social system, sympathize with the oppressed, or satirize shameless behavior. The audience is greatly influenced by these three. As for Curtiz, he is also a famous director, known for his light and profound style. The last director is truly well-known for his tragic and gorgeous techniques in Hollywood.</p>
<h3>The Performing Arts of the Jiye Brothers</h3>
<p>— Bing Jiu</p>
<p>The alumni team of the former capital's Fuliancheng Society, in response to a recruitment, has already arrived in Shanghai. The team is mainly composed of the Jiye three brothers, supplemented by Yan Shishan, Ai Shiju, and Yuan Shihai, Ru Fulan, etc., who are staying in Shanghai. The lineup is quite neat. The Jiye three brothers are Jiye Shengzhang, Jiye Shenglan, and Jiye Shichang. Shenglan has been in Shanghai for many years and is familiar to the people of Shanghai. Shengzhang and Shichang are mostly unaware of their skills and experiences. Therefore, I will introduce them as follows:</p>
<p>Jiye Shengzhang is the third son of the late Fuliancheng Society President Jiye Shanchun, and is also the pillar of today's Fu Society. Shanchun governed his family strictly. Shengzhang entered the ranks of actors at a young age. His father did not let him enter the Fuliancheng Society, which he founded, but sent him to Zhu Youfen's Fuqing Society class, fearing his arrogance. At that time, the training classes treated their disciples extremely strictly. If they violated the class rules even slightly, they would be whipped. After entering the training class, Shengzhang studied martial arts, but due to malnutrition and mental exhaustion, he was dissatisfied with his teachers and often suffered Xia Chu. Over time, he became thin and weak, and fell ill. Shen Xiushui, from the Fu Society's foreign affairs department, saw him and took pity on him, and hired a doctor to treat him. Before long, he recovered from his illness. Shen then interceded with Shanchun, and Shanchun allowed him to enter the Fu Society, specializing in martial arts, and his skills greatly improved. He first publicly performed "Wild Goose Plume Armor" at Harfeier, which was very popular with the audience. It was even praised as the first person after Wang (Changlin) and Chuan (Xiaoshan). Shanchun died and he supported the Fu Society alone until today. His signature plays are "Three Thefts and One Steal", the three thefts being "Shi Qian Stealing Armor", "Zhu Guangzu Stealing Hook", "Yang Xiangwu Stealing Cup"; and one steal being "Shi Qian Stealing Chicken". The older generation of martial arts comedians, such as Wang Changlin and Chuan Xiaoshan, have passed away one after another. Shengzhang is the only one who can perform "Three Thefts and One Steal" successfully. Moreover, Ye is in his prime, full of energy, and possesses all kinds of soft and light martial arts skills. It is a pity that his recitative is slightly close to Chuan Xiaoshan, and he cannot achieve the spicy and crisp effect, which is a minor flaw.</p>
<p>Jiye Shenglan ranks fourth and specializes in civil and martial arts xiaosheng. His signature plays such as "The Story of Two Meetings", "Yue Family Village", "White Gate Tower", "Shooting Halberds", "Group Fire Meeting", "Yaguan Building", "Exploring the Village", and "Night Flight" are all well-crafted. The people of Shanghai have seen them many times and have a fixed evaluation. This time, he came to the south and plans to perform interspersed with Hua Dan operas, which is his basic skill. I think if he performs "Yingjie Lie", "Hua Mulan", "Hong Ni Guan" and other plays, the results will definitely be above the average Hua Dan.</p>
<p>Jiye Shichang is the younger brother of Shengzhang and Shenglan, and also a student of the Fu Society. He is intelligent and Shanchun loved this son the most. He sings Laosheng, and his voice and appearance are both good. He has now graduated and can perform dozens of plays. His skills are similar to those of Chi Shigong, who was previously affiliated with Gengxin, but his voice is higher and brighter. He once had a setback during his training, but fortunately he recovered soon. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Beiping Liyan Newspaper held a children's election, and Shichang won the first place with 4,266 votes. The people's esteem at that time can be imagined, and his skills can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Portraits of Female Artists</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiang</p>
<p>(5) Chen Qi</p>
<p>Like Sun Jinglang, Chen Qi also jumped from the drama stage to the silver screen. Now she is a basic actress of Hezong Film Company and also a member of the Xinyi Drama Club. The famous playwright Wei Ruhui is one of the most appreciative of Chen Qi; under Wei Ruhui's support, she swayed in the art world like a wild rose.</p>
<p>This year, she is still only a seventeen-year-old girl. Her original name is Cui Di. She studied at the Sino-French Drama School and was one of the basic teams of the Sino-French Drama Club. She once played Qijin's wife in "Ah Q" and also played Wu Ma's role, and became famous for starring in Xu Xingzhi's one-act play "Little Hero". She has been engaged in drama work for a not short history, so her stage experience is also relatively rich. Later, she joined the Shanghai Drama Club and played the role of Mei Niang in "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty" (ie "Ge Nenniang"), which won more widespread praise. Her joining Hezong Film Company was also at this time, and her debut work was "Xiang Fei", in which she played the role of Lan'er. It was Wei Ruhui who introduced her to Hezong.</p>
<p>Now, Hezong is filming "Sai Jinhua", and Chen Qi is also participating in the performance, playing the role of Shan'er. "The script of Sai Jinhua was written by Zhu Shilin, and the materials were provided by Wei Ruhui. Wei initially intended to have Chen Qi play two different roles, but Zhu Shilin did not accept this opinion after consideration and deleted a part of the materials contributed by Wei, so Chen Qi only played the role of Shan'er.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Xinyi Drama Club performed "Sea Hero" at the Xuangong Theater, with Chen Qi playing Zheng Chenggong's daughter Zheng Yu. Although there was only one scene, she cried in every scene, and many audience members shed tears with her. This proves that she is a female artist full of emotion. I once had the following poem to praise her: "Naturally, her beautiful eyebrows are gifted, and her tears are like hemp when she stops playing the silver zither; over the years, she has written all over the sad farewell pen, not as good as a daughter on the song stage." It was written after watching her performance in "Sea Hero".</p>
<p>But "privately" she is a naughty child. She loves to joke, loves to tease artists, and is bold and sassy about everything, which is the opposite of the personality she shows on stage. So comparing her to a wild rose is the most appropriate. She is a gorgeous and thorny flower in the art world. (Tomorrow's notes on Ying Yin)</p>
<h3>The Song Team of the "Northwest Photography Team"</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines News) The "Northwest Photography Team", under the leadership of Captain Ying Yunwei, went to Mongolia to film "Frontier Storm", and the work has been completed. When they were about to set off, Sheng Jialun and Wu Yin collaborated on two team songs, which were quite heroic. Now they are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Forward, forward, forward together, we are silver warriors, we are iron troops of drama; not afraid of thousands of miles, not afraid of ten thousand mountains, marching to the desolate desert, breaking through the biting cold; creating a storm on the frontier, completing our great mission. Comrades, go forward, work hard to go forward, create a storm on the frontier, complete our great mission.</p>
<p>Forward, forward, forward together, we are silver warriors, we are iron troops of drama; not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of hardships, promoting the cooperation between Han and Mongolians, breaking their conspiracies, creating a storm on the frontier, completing our great mission. Comrades, go forward, work hard to go forward, create a storm on the frontier, complete our great mission.</p>

<h3>Xiao Linghong Performs Spinning Cotton</h3>
<p>— Her husband</p>
<p>Since the northern Kun actors Wu Suqiu, Liang Xiaoluan, Tong Zhiling, etc. performed spinning cotton, this play has suddenly become a hot play, but the southern Kun actors who perform this play are still lacking. Now I heard that Xiao Linghong will perform this play at the Golden Theater. The content includes learning the four or five flower caves of the four famous female actors, Tan Dangying's Black Basin, Ma Lianliang's Sweet Dew Temple, Borrowing the East Wind, Mei Lanfang's Life and Death Hate, as well as Peng Peng Drum, small songs, and also has the original creation of playing the accordion and singing popular songs. It is full of tricks, which the northern Kun actors have not had. I think it will be a perfect performance at that time.</p>
<h3>Violet Performs in Thailand and Turns to Malaysia</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>(Bangkok Airlines News) The troupe led by movie star Violet, after performing at the Nanxing Theater here, has been well received by overseas Chinese groups. Now that Singapore intends to invite the troupe to perform in the Malay area, the terms of both parties have been signed after a negotiation. Violet led a group of people out of the Thai capital on the fifth of this month, took a train south through Penang, and will first perform in Singapore, and then transfer to Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and other places to perform. It will be after the new calendar year before they can return to Hong Kong.</p>
