<p>社評</p>
<h3>張伯倫於邱吉爾論</h3>
<p>昨日倫敦電訊，英國邱吉爾內閣於十二日經下議院票決信任；邱吉爾氏以十三日奉國王命令，組織內閣，目前雖有若干比較次要之閣員人選猶待銓衡，然以下議院之通過而在法律上旣告完成；更以各黨領袖之自始許以合作，各黨議員之一致加以擁護，尤在政治上克竟全功。英國方在憂患之中：遠征軍則挫敗於挪威，弱小鄰邦荷蘭比利時盧森堡則被侵於强敵，大局震撼；政府黨擁有下院絕對多數議席，而外則輿情囂然，內則裂痕宛然；乃於此際，中樞更張，不惟面目一新，抑目充實强健，指揮如定，舉重若輕，此誠英人政治知能之優越使然，亦因邱吉爾氏爲衆望所歸；凡屬英國之友，莫不爲之欣慰也，</p>
<p>邱吉爾氏與前首相張伯倫氏俱隸保守黨，邱氏本爲張閣之海軍大臣而茲任首相，張氏以首相而茲在邱閣之樞密大臣；他如外交大臣哈里法克斯氏，內務兼平民安全部大臣安德遜氏，商務大臣鄧肯氏等，皆保守黨而在邱閣蟬聯張閣之原任；又如現任陸車大臣艾登氏，財務大臣伍德氏等亦保守黨員，司法大臣西門爲國民自由黨員，皆張閣閣員而茲在邱閣皆蟬聯而調部；此外，所傳新閣員之屬保守黨員者猶不乏人。雖然，此次英國內閣改組之意義，旣未可以其首相之仍屬保守黨，若干閣員之或蟬聯或調任，遂僅視之爲一黨內部人事之替換；亦未可以各黨領袖在保守黨首相之下參加組閣，遂僅視之爲保守黨政權之開放；蓋張伯倫內閣爲政黨內閣，邱吉爾內閣爲國民內閣，其本質逈乎不同。抑英國政府由政黨內閣而改組爲國民內閣，復非僅英國政治上之重要演變，幷將予國際以重大之影響。何以言之？英國之對德國宣戰，對法國締盟，對波蘭諾言，對挪威荷蘭比利時盧森堡　力援助，對土耳其相協定，對希臘羅馬尼亞提保證，此數者，誠最近與將來國際局勢進展之主要因素，鑄定之於保守黨張伯倫內閣時代，乃爲今後英國國際政策中之主要部分而絕不搖撼者；固無論政府之為國民內閣。甚或爲非保守黨之他黨政黨內閣，事同一律，勢必然也。即如對美國之親和，對中國之同情；對義大利與蘇聯之又驚又愛，若即若離，交好交惡，爲友爲敵，亦各有其基本之條件；事關英國利害，必不因首揆易人而劇變。然力米之運用，邱閣必異於張　；而邱張二氏所予國際之印象，以及由印象所引起可能之反應，則於此邱吉爾氏掌政伊始之際，凡百尙未開始舉措之時，旣得覘知其懸殊。</p>
<p>張伯倫氏者，英國傳統之君子人也；其於國際，親疎之道，取予之義，及其辨事決策，進退從違，罔不恰合英國式之規矩。顧乃掌政五年，適逢世界空前未有之奇變；而與之對手者，蘇聯之史太令氏也，德意志之希特勒氏也，義大利之墨索里尼氏也，日本之羣閥也，舉非國際正常之軌範所得以相繩，羣居習慣之情理所得以相擬，亦即非操持英國傳統之規矩者所得而與之相周旋；於是張伯倫氏所如輒左，所謀輒敗，所獲之答案乃無一而不與其所期待之趨歸相背道而馳。彼嘗慷慨宣言，終彼之生，不願復見英國從事於慘酷殘暴之殺戮，顧仍不得不躬自對德宣戰；祗此一端，可槪其餘。然苦心孤詣，委屈求全，猶能挈其軍民共赴疆塲，固非闒茸庸流所克致此，而不失其爲英國之政治家者也。終彼之閣，不惟他黨恥與合作，甚至同黨相率唾棄；則所親呢之閣僚，如西門與霍爾輩固應分其謗；亦以五年失着，徒事補牢，其客觀之政績自有不得不去者；况戰時戰後，對內對外旣非張伯倫氏之信譽與魄力所勝號召矣。</p>
<p>至於邱吉爾氏，於彼臀任首相後，固將何以應付當前艱鉅，自非今日所得申論。然有可得而預言者：邱氏性格強毅氣槪則叱咤風雲，作風則大刀闊斧；明理而敏斷，言必信，行必果。故能無分黨派畛域而得全體國民之信任；其所予國際之印象，亦然。抑不惟邱氏其人而已，張伯倫內閣閣員中最負國內外盛譽之外相哈里法克斯氏，視首相有出藍之觀者，邱氏倚畀之以原職；遷原任海外部大臣艾登氏爲陸相，艾氏亦嘗任外相，馳譽宇內，固保守黨之新銳少壯也。工黨領袖阿德里氏與格林伍德氏不但入閣，且居內閣戰時會議五席中之二席，自由黨領袖辛克萊氏則任航空大臣，此三人者。代表二黨，當其在野之日，最懷疑於張伯倫氏遠東政策之疲弱而再三大聲疾呼。總之，爲邱吉爾氏股肱者，崇高峻挺，皆屬一時之選；其閣員陣容若此，宜爲舉國愛戴。而張伯倫氏之國際政策；往日雖國際承認之爲大體不謬，徒以其表示遊移，好稱「妥約」「綏靖」，遂致引起國際之輕蔑，友邦之懷疑者，及今必以邱吉爾氏曁其重要閣僚之陣容，而表示其政策之堅定；亦必於是而爲輕蔑者所忌憚，懷疑者所信任。茲在戰時，最後之一切固待決軍事之勝敗，然邱吉爾內閣至少必能增進美國對英之善意與信心，必能增進其對華同情之實效，由是而促進英美在遠東平行之程度，此數者，固決定國際方來變局之骨幹也。</p>
<h3>德軍猛攻伸入法境　歐洲開空前大戰　列日為中心德軍分左右兩翼挺進　塞丹朗威兩城法國守軍被迫後撤</h3>

<h3>英新政府　遠東政策　渝大公報之評論</h3>
<p>重慶　此間大公報頃著社論、題曰「請問英國新內閣之外交政策」、措辭頗爲露骨、因其爲超然派報紙、文內表示之論調、總可反映目前一般華人之意見、該文首稱邱吉爾爲幹總勤奮之領袖、謂吾人在此歐戰危急之秋、要求英國新內閣陳述其遠東政策、似或非其時、惟吾人有須指明者即邱氏如非當機立斷之人物吾人自可不必多此一舉、因即使要求亦將無結果也、現以邱氏常對遠東事務表示深切注意、且爲抱積極政策之人物、故吾人願提出此中英互有利益之問題、吾人坦白承認在最近數月中、一般華人對於英日妥協之可能性、頗表憂慮、吾人對之殊不以爲然，並非相信張伯倫不願與日本妥協、實以此項問題不僅與英國有關也、據吾人之意見、不干預即爲妥協、英外部最近固會宣言英國遠東政策並無變更、且將不放棄九國公約之原則、但吾人對之誠加縝密之考慮後、必可斷言英國之遠東政策不論是否有任何變更、殊無多大差別、英之貿易已爲日本所破壞矣、權利亦遭其蹂躪矣、而英國始終容忍無所行動、英國駐日大使克萊琪更時常請求日本之妥協與諒解、是以英國遠東政策並無變更之宣言、實際等於空談、且有理由可懼其在事實上已秘密發生變化、由消極的妥協進而爲積極之妥協、據各評論家之意見、張伯倫政府之末葉、確願與日妥協、倘使日本同意恢復英日同盟、或臻於英日諒解在歐戰中維持有利英方之優惠的中立、吾人或可斷定張伯倫將已加以接受矣、然則何以上述情形未見實現乎、第一、日本願有另一英日同盟、日人中反英情緒頗爲强烈、克萊琪之小動作殊不足以感動日人、克氏之形容愈謙抑有田之態度乃愈傲慢、第二、美國朝野均反對與日妥協政策因美國在目前歐戰中地位之重要、克萊琪之政策未能在張伯倫內閣中澈底實施、故英日妥協之未實現、並非由於英之政策、實因美國與日本之政策使然、中國政府過去十年中之主要外交政策、始終親英、此種情形在中國平民之中尤爲確實、對英之友誼與對蘇美者完全相同、其理由係因英國之公衆輿論、尤其爲文化階級、對華頗表同情、中國及近華各地如香港與新加坡等處之英官方及人民、均曾予中國以有價値之援助、華人爲富於情感之人民、並了解他人之困難，克萊琪之政策頗引起華人之扼腕但非激烈之反對、吾人希望邱吉爾將首先決定誰爲英國在遠東之眞正友人及仇敵、應勿與仇敵繼續妥協而必須對友人作有效之援助、吾人深知此次戰事對於英國之意義、際此危急時期、英國目不堪再與日本發生糾紛、吾人對此頗得諒解一切、惟態度爲一事而政策又爲一事、不幸去年中克萊琪之種種活動、實已超逾態度範圍而確爲英國之政策、英國雖不能採取反日之態度、但可援助中國、英國曾以二千五百萬鎊貸於土耳其、其對華之借款果何如乎、恐其數額較貸予羅馬尼亞者尙不及遠甚也、英國目前每日戰費需六百萬鎊、倘能以三日之費用援助中國、其效力自將頗爲可觀、倘英國預備作戰三年、此三日之軍費、果能對於安定遠東局勢有甚大之貢獻者、則對於其全部軍事預算誠屬微乎其微矣（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>紐約外滙市場　鎊價繼續下跌</h3>

<h3>謠風愈傳愈熾　金市不堪回首　外滙鬆勢變本加厲抵價見六四六〇元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、跌風之厲、誠屬空前、大有一瀉千里之勢、經營者忐忑不安、尤以多　蒙受莫大打擊後、手足無措、故價格起仆雖巨、成交反缺、至暴落原因、不外謠言盛　、其中以近日華軍載事大捷、而又有中日和平之揣測、及美國或將捲入入戰、黃金前途黯淡、更傳德軍已突破馬奇諾防綫、致本市外商銀行發生　存風潮、匯市遂此奇鬆、金市亦跟隨崩落、論全日經過、初開僅跌三十五元、嗣即續撳中、雖匯市轉軟而稍回、但午刻前最低已告六千五百八十元、後市初開金號買進、抬達七百元開盤、不久外匯鬆勢、變本加厲、慘降至六千四百六十元、時證券幫錢兌業吐賣最力、後以和平謠言失實、某證券幫搜人、曾回升為六千六百五十元、結果人心疲軟、多頭復起了結、收盤仍祇六千五百七十元、較上日狂跌三百二十五元、全天交易約三千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛小三十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌三百餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯兌雖跌、但本市美匯告緊後、甫即回鬆、是以人心依然疲弱、開時首山金號出錢兌業二十兩、為六千八百六十元、較上日　小三十五元、嗣因金號及某錢兌業爭先力塞、而進者仍少、　時間又降七十元、金號出銀號十兩、祇為六千七百九十元、旋乃匯市略定、賣風稍殺、且另一錢兌業及銀號撈入頗多、遂回升六十元、銀號進同業等共五十兩為六千八百五十元、不意其時賣風復起、蓋市上利空謠言四集、加之匯市重又猛鬆、金號證券幫競向吐售、而某錢兌業復來力塞、且買戶寥寥、不久遂暴落二百七十元、銀號互做十兩、僅為六千五百八十元、迨收盤時外匯略告回軟、故市勢稍轉、某錢兌業及金號獲利互相復進回漲八十元、錢兌　進銀號三十兩、為六千六百六十元作午收價、午後開時金號抬價收買、達告稍漲、金號進銀　帮三十兩、為六千七百元、但斯時賣者四起、隔手即做小五十元、後冉因外匯鬆動、賣戶絡繹不絕證券幫錢兌業塞出尤多、而買者吃胃極薄、遂又猛瀉二百元、銀號出金號十兩、為六千四百六十元、　乃匯市止鬆步回、且傳午前中日和平謠言不確、致頓引起買風、銀號幫及另一證券幫爭先拖入、不久即回漲一百九十元、銀號進金號十兩、為六千六百五十元、入後買者减少、價重向下、某證券幫復來吐出若　、又退至六千五百七十元作晚收價、結果比上日猛跌三百二十五元、查已連小三天、共跌五百廿元、收後照晚收價再低十元、尙乏受主、全大四百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>紗花　人心虛怯　紗市直瀉　雙馬跌七十元</h3>
<p>紗市大跌、且直綫下瀉、此因外匯放長、金價下落、同時謠言紛紛、市塲情形、紊亂如蔴、</p>
<p>現紗　開市况尙和平、因外滙改縮、二十支雙馬現貨價為一千六百十元、漲至十二元元、旋聞謠言蜂起、多頭吐出、同時美滙掛升、賣氣大熾、跌至一千五百四十五元、查半日間成交統計一千五百二十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨跌七十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行　七六五　香港　七　五統計一·五二〇</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日頗為堅定、　　斯股票猛跌、然棉市則因　業之購買、及空頭之抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲四五磅　、印度昨日停市、價測跌四羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日各方謠傳甚多、同業値此暴風雨中、擬暫抱觀望、天津帮昨日進　較為呆滯、然價格始終高昂異常、茲將昨日棉市以美滙四元八七五折合送廠價如下</p>

<h3>證券　外股慘跌內債昂進</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况忽起意外漲風、趨勢甚勁、同時外滙放長甚遠、金子及各種貨品無不狂跌、市上謠言　起、或謂××赴渝、和平空氣濃厚、多日來萎軟無神之市况、驟見興奮、甲種猛漲至六十元外、戊種又衝出五十元關、午後尤為堅挺、但和平謠言毫無根據、其他各種之狂瀉、完全因荷比形勢惡劣、歐洲戰事有變化、且以未能確定利多利空、此種風潮、大都仍屬於心理作用、前途變化尙多、未可執一而論也、買賣各戶、以天生聯益義泰及散戶始終買進、餘如怡泰中一怡康永康鴻大及六十四號先後均有買進、聯和多頭忽又出籠、同康始終賣出、泰豐五豐益昌鴻康均有賣出、市價仍因求過於供、上漲甚力、結果一致漲六七角至一元〇五分、成交約一百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>衆業公所昨日開盤、因隔晚紐約股市慘跌、價格自始即告不支、後來賣風愈烈、　至買方不敢出價、直至晚收前之最後半句鐘、價格方有回頭、英聯怡和及各實業股所跌甚鉅、國際信　　揚子銀公司股頃各宣布派息一元半、故二者價俱　定、揚子股起伏於極狹隘之波動價格內、非如其他　名股上落之大、　皮　慘跌亦鉅、東印各公可設、復處重重賣方壓力下、</p>
<h3>雜糧　餅銷開展</h3>
<p>昨日油豆餅市况、仍先疲後緊、結果因外來空氣不振、昨豆餅去　仍活絡、除汕頭幫半裝半心思銷塲外、其他與化廈門及內河各鄕帮等、續來問津、故上午趨勢　形堅持、但午後人心受空氣打擊、　勢不無動搖、交易因之减色、統共成交大有餘廠四牌餅六千張、價為十一元四角半至十一元三角半、浦東　甡廠記餅三百張價為十元零六角半、常州溥利廠肥字餅一車、價為十元零七角、及烟　餅三千張、價為十一元至十元零八角云、</p>

<p>邇來米市自再度回緊、連朝高升、昨日漲　仍熾、各色洋米價、又達前次一號西　五十四元小絞五十二元之最高峯、在此數日內突又增高六元之巨、可見近時米價變化之烈、　以洋米產地劃價、復告高漲、頗難合通、其後未續訂購、故滬棧存底已可握計、况歐戰風雲日緊、影響前途多多、微聞原根客販心思更堅、不獨悉謀固守、月從而收進、於是一遇問津、喊聲迭起、應需實銷不惜貴價採辦、業之內地鄕莊客戶繼續放價搜辦各貨、價格遂在羣相扳抬之下、屢見高騰、詎料市面愈緊、一般心思家混沌異常、若西貢小絞遂達前關之高峯、獲利者見市面案已塔尖、突將手貨乘高回出、俄見一號西貢回至五十三元、小絞五十一元、計瀉一元、第知低價方出、補空復起、形勢即又還俏、轉瞬恢復原盤、從此起伏不定、變化多端、盤旋往復、常有元許上落、然始終木能穿出前盤、新造高峯、卒以五十四元西貢五十二元之小絞收盤、比前市收價、計增元半左右耳、</p>
<p>國糯自近兩朝突有大戶囤積、銷塲轉旺、市面一反前態、昨則雖以洋米續漲、但其勢已不若前之興奮、致行情僅加半元至近元而已、若溧陽特元開四十六元三角、金壇特元四十六元四十五元八角、常丹高元四十四五元、中市者四十二三元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、其來源仍稀、而塲外暗盤、傳聞相　洋米、並駕前驅、做開旣夥、價亦續升元外、無錫特淸坯五十三四元、紛粳五十二三元常崑粳五十二三元、次至宿貨五十一元左右、靑泗薄稻五十二元半、次至五十一元、南港早稻五十一元云云、</p>
<h3>粉麥交易復靜</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日復告沉靜、本街因天雨、實銷不振、進胃呆懈、由各廠直接批出者、不足五千包、回籠貨買賣均寂、老車牌棧單大致與廠盤頗埒、內地粉銷化亦淡、祇順風牌開過十三元八角五分、偶有零星交易而已、小麥交易、日商一動即靜、華廠與出口帮去化仍滯、新麥上市漸近、預卜收成可豐、故陳麥市面、早已落令、正式交易、須待諸新麥登塲云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　浮囤傾吐　布價猛跌</h3>
<p>國布昨市外滙　鬆、金價紗價一齊挫跌、布疋兼因實銷日蹙、執貨者心思浮動、傾　賣出、市　跌勢漸猛、細布細斜粗布小五角至一元半、漂染布小一元左右、本街成交各布二百餘件、港幫辦粗布細斜色布一百數十件、浙路溫甬台幫辦色布色斜等近百件、國外星加坡　地辦色布漂布五千數百疋</p>

<h3>黑炭襯搜羅一空</h3>
<p>黑炭　、昨市頗形缺　、按一般廠戶大半俱為原料高貴、成本與市價背道而馳、悉多停織、一無出品、因之單　舊存　貨、供不敷求、早已逐漸　　一空、全毛每碼售五元五角、紗毛頭號漲售四元二角半、二號漲售三元七八角、尙乏　批者在、祗源昌與華洋德昌等門莊、略有零星應市耳、聞織製黑炭　原料毛、目今洋行現貨極寡、每磅須售十五六元、一磅毛　和棉紗、最多可織出四碼半、於是加一切人工開繳、新出品黑炭　、二號貨每碼須血本四元之上、與現市相合、尙要虧本三四角、</p>

<h3>絲茶日絲大跌</h3>
<p>昨國外絲價、突轉下跌、　　現貨跌八十元、遠期跌四十八元、紐約近期較週六跌一角二分、遠期跌一角一分、本埠絲市、因鑒於今庚繭本昂貴收繭困難、且通來天氣欠佳、一　絲商咸不敢貿然拋貨、對於手　則心　　昂亦不輕售、昨市無成交、白　經七八分持價六二〇〇元、　洋商不能接受云、</p>
<p>天津來人造絲七件、毛冷二百箱、</p>
<h3>無錫春蠶良好</h3>
<p>—日方統制繭行</p>
<p>無錫四鄕蠶　、日來蠶身發育頗速、現下大幫已在　　、早幫三眠開葉、惟桑葉因產量不數供應、價格飛漲、東南路各鄕每市直直梗已喊至十二三元、西路如五里湖一帶、竟喊至十五元、繭行巴在籌備、大宗受日方統制、收繭各行、槪須登記、</p>
<h3>南北貸　生曬圓肉軋缺</h3>
<p>生　圓肉、近以到貨無　、存底日見單薄、查號貨早已開通而行存亦僅零星小數、故市價由疲轉　、有回升之望、惟陳貨不奇云、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條　狂漲數百元</h3>
<p>五金市面、昨日尙屬平定、蓋外匯已平、人心見安、唯各五金品之行情、依然堅昂、實係歐戰日見擴大、兼之太平洋風雲惡劣、來源　促、申市所存當屬有限、唯諸客幫與廠家之銷路、照樣依舊致日後日、當有難免斷擋之日、　而執貨者心思更居奇不售其中之竹節鋼條、尤屬令人注意、該貨唯一去路、為本街建築幫、此外外埠客幫則殊屬少　、查是貨在五月一日前（此次外匯未發生劇變前）每　尙售一千元、且銷胃很滯、豈料此次外　慘落後、各路進意反濃、存底單薄、一時行情狂跳、一日問相差數百元、昨日止、每　喊價已高至一千五百餘元（三分四分貨）、而五分至粗花色之每　售價亦已昂至一千四百五十元開外、</p>
<h3>新盤元　所漲甚厲</h3>

<h3>林語堂在菲敷陳　中國抗戰佔優勢　日本實力空虛接濟斷絕分析精當證明中國必勝</h3>
<p>國際知名之作家林　　氏、旅美四載、近已專程返國、以迎取中國之最後勝利、道經馬尼、刺時、曾發表談話、對　　之勝利、表示無限之樂觀、茲聞林氏又在馬尼刺發表公開演講、凡往聽者、均須購買門票、眼以券資全部撥充中國工業合作社經費、</p>
<p>前倨後恭徬徨無計</p>
<p>其演詞稱、一　認為目前之中日戰事、有如一新型別克汽車、馳騁於廣野之上、日本為該車、而中國則為無垠大野、目前吾人固難預料該車是否可直駛而前、抑在中途毀損、但値將重視者、即為駕駛汽車之人、漫無目標、其致命之傷、則為車中汽油缺如、全賴油站之不斷供給、而所有油站、則皆由　國經營、駕駛者獲得汽油之後、而予經營者之酬報、則為不斷之侮辱、遂使油站主人一怒而絕其供應、於是駕駛者前　而後恭、為之徬徨無計、</p>
<p>有利形勢令人興奮</p>
<p>又謂、「余未離　時　　國報紙載稱、日本對於和平、頗為樂觀、但和平之樂觀、亦即對戰爭之悲觀也、中國之態度則反是、日本業已萎靡無力、不復能發動如武漢一役之戰事、因是日本欲再深入內地、絕不可能、其不能在佔領區內、善自建設、其理亦同、一言以蔽之、實力空虛而已、日本在中國佔領若干土地、其足以利日本者、僅為撤兵時之便於假道」、林氏又表示、對目前抗戰之有利形勢、頗極興奮、林氏返國後、將携　眷屬居重慶、聞林氏在馬尼刺、又曾作其富有詩意之談話云、「余素愛欣賞日落之景、今尤愛之、每觀落日西沉、必自念曰、日已落矣、日人在中國海岸、又已消耗五百萬財力矣、余堅信中國之前途無量、無足担憂、故世界各國人士、亦可不必為中國作杞憂也」、</p>

<h3>蘇打泉的溯源</h3>
<p>杜朗發明了蘇打泉的裴置，從美國流行到法國，英國……許多商人從此發跡，整千累萬的男女老幼，和這個怡神理氣，恢復疲勞的泉　做了密友。單就美國一處來講，這種冷飲室就有九萬處之多，其中三萬處屬於藥店，四萬處屬於糖菓舖·俱樂部·球塲·和地下車站。此外一萬五千處蘇打泉設於白貨商店，及各色店舖中，五千處在各旅館和餐館中，每年營業的總數着實可觀哩。</p>
<p>這個法國人杜朗，本來在拿破崙的軍營中充當藥劑師，一八一七年被放逐至美國，尋求生路，流浪於紐約，波士頓，巴　的摩，而最後才到費拉台兩菲亞。那裏法國人倒有不少，拿破崙的一個兄第也在其中，而且這地方又是美國的藥業中心，杜朗就決心在　裏　創一業。</p>
<p>在沒有服役於拿翁軍中之前，杜朗曾就學於希佛利氏，這是一位博學多能的法國人。所有植物學，礦學，藥，化學學等都是希氏所親授，所以杜朗也就成為一個多才多藝的人了。他在費拉台爾菲亞開了一　藥舖子，兼售飲料，烟草　類，出售的各種蘇打水就是他的特殊飲料。</p>
<p>一八二五年四月這新型　舖開幕，蘇打泉成為最受人歡迎的裝置，裏面有桃心木，箱架，磁瓶，法國藥品，化學品，鏡子，和一個大　石櫃台，在這大　石櫃台上裝設有做蘇打水的器具。　下上海各冷飲空中的蘇打泉　　，用大　石來做櫃台，倒並不是偶然的哩。（E.L.）</p>

<h3>母親的品格　（三）</h3>
<p>無母的孩子，生活的機會不如他人，他的人生賽跑，將因此受很火阻礙。大人物的所以成功，多得力于母親，無母的孩子可憐，無良母的孩子更可憐。相博有一個不肖母親，生了一個不肖兒子，有一次兒子犯法被獲，將下監時，當推事聲言，要與母親一晤，推事准之，那知會面時，他竟恨命把母親的耳朶，咬掉一隻，據說，他母親剝奪了他的天賦權利，完善的敎養。當希臘羅馬有賢母訓練兒女的時候，國家强盛稱雄一時，後來，希臘出一班花花公子，羅馬出一班淫邪之人，上帝乃開始抹去他們的榮耀，使他們國家顚覆，正如人抹除盤中之物，復將盤子倒放一般。（四）仁慈白花生長，表明母親的仁慈。母親的生活是仁慈的，是有長進的。在這家庭學校裏，不但有孩子做學生，母親自己也遇事留心學習，因之，她的慈愛之心，乃日見擴大。（五）忠實白花資質，表明母親的忠實。母親的愛心，永不減退，她的態度，是十分忠實的。孩子生病，纏綿不愈，做父親的許因焦急而灰心，母親却忘記疲倦，始終向前希望着，父親不耐煩兒子的剛愎不聽語，或者要把兒子從家中趕出去，母親呢，不然。她永不灰心，她的愛心把兒女兒束着，不任他們　開，所以人類的母親，是値得我們十分尊敬的。但是，有見識的母親，却不肯把這樣的尊敬，　爲已有，因她所有的淸潔，美麗，愛心，和忠實等，都祇是上帝眞光的反映他得將一切榮耀，歸于上帝。（完）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>一本六年生的日記</h3>
<p>— 許弼德</p>
<p>筆者承蒙一位好友介紹，在某義務小學試敎，當批改一本六年生日記，有這樣的幾頁，現在把他抄在下面：</p>
<p>五月二日，今天二房東叫了三個白相人，把我們的床，檯子，椅子，不講理統統搬到弄堂裏。我爸爸說：「房金請再寬待幾天，把東西仍搬進去好吧。」白相人非但不答應，反而拳頭揑緊，兇勢很怕，急得我媽說不出一句話，小妹妹哭個不止。後來幸虧隔壁老伯伯出來說情，准定等幾天付，東西仍搬進去。</p>
<p>五月三日，爸爸愁眉苦險，還是我不到工作，爸爸對媽媽說：「我想借印子錢，做做小販看。」媽媽說：「必須先捐照會才可做呢。</p>
<p>五月四日，爸爸氣喘，面色不大好看，他說：「唉！今天借來的印子錢三十元，放在袋裏不知怎樣會遺失的。」媽媽着急地說：「道怎末得了，越是窮，越是死！」</p>
<p>五月五日，媽病了，身子發熱，爸爸兩手空空，那兒有錢請醫生呢，小妹妹還吵鬧向爸爸要大餅油條吃，爸爸沒辦法。</p>
<p>五月六日，媽媽能起身了，大槪昨天午時，茶藥的效騐，我眞開心，媽媽又有力氣，可以替人家洗衣服了。爸爸說：「今天的印子錢無論如何要打的，還有房錢要付的，不付又要來這麼一套。」媽媽說：「沒有地方借錢，工作又我不到，現在祇好想法把檯子椅子賣給舊貨攤冉說。」</p>
<p>五月八日，現在我們家裏除掉　碎東西外。祇有一隻床了。</p>
<h3>兒童犯罪問題</h3>
<p>當一個小生命呱呱墜地的時候，做父母的總有說不出的喜歡，更抱着莫天的熱望，希望目己的小孩長大後出人頭地，做一番大事業，替家門增光榮，爲社會國家効力。但是沒有父母苦心的敎導，那是很危險的，所謂「人之初，性本善，性相近，習相遠。」是古人明察人性之言。人性本是良善的，但是環境的好壞，能把小孩的天眞的善性，走入歧途。</p>
<p>兒童的犯罪，就成爲目前社會嚴重間題之一，不得不爲兒童敎育的大缺陷。</p>
<p>這問題在熱鬧的都市中更容易發生，近來更迅速的在發展着，數日前有一篇關於「小竊黨」的報吿，要加以設法制化，而積極的辦法，那唯有從根底着手不爲功。</p>
<p>（一）兒童犯罪的原因</p>
<p>（一）家庭環境的不良：（二）結交卑劣的朋友：（三）兒童保護人的不良：（四）受外界的引誘。</p>
<p>（二）兒童犯罪的種類</p>
<p>（一）盜竊或搶刦：（二）怠惰逃學：（三）行爲小正，破壞治安。</p>
<p>（三）如何阻止兒童的犯罪</p>
<p>（一）組織有敎育性的兒童集會；（二）改善靑年的團體（敎養院）等；（三）實行較佳的兒童犯罪法；（四）有充分的公園及運動塲，以供兒童正當的遊戲。（五）導以正常的娛樂；（六）實行强迫敎育，使兒童明瞭自身的潔好，步入正軌；（七）硏究其原因。而給與良好的開導。</p>
<p>以上不過是一個大槪，希望熱心公益的人士們，做一些玫善兒童的善舉，爲社會謀幸福，爲國家樹光明。</p>
<h3>囤積的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 鋻天</p>
<p>歐洲戰事發生以後，投機市塲上流行着一句新的「格言」：是洋貨都可以囤積起來。於是舉凡衣着，日用所需品，甚至藥品，化粧品等，都鎖之堆棧，束之高閣，靜待外滙波動，含着雪茄等發財。</p>
<p>這情形也應響了一般人，手里稍有幾個錢的也抄抄人家的老文章，「塌一點貨色」。</p>
<p>我友某君，不知什麽道理，或者竟是打「冷門」，囤了一批　針。過了幾天，果然冷炭里暴熱栗子，洋針價格大漲。但是囤　容易脫貨難，　着等着，遷是堆在家里無法「兌現」。到現在爲止，照市面上的價格，富然是賺的，可是即使登廣吿，也沒有人來　這筆生意經，看來祇有自己留着用，囤積到底了！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿四回　湖山蕩滌各有千秋　士女歡騰共呼萬歲</p>
<p>且說朱愛人等到了無錫惠泉山的玩具害，見他們陳列着一組三個兒童泥人，面孔絕似她們育嬰院裏的三胞胎。問起根由，知道也是薛夫人她們的玩具廠裏的出品。原來這也是從歐美那些玩具公司裏先發起。十年以前，他們製造的洋娃娃，就有電影小明星秀蘭鄧波兒，和伙安挪竇萍的偶像。還有加拿大的一胎五女，也被玩具店製造出來，這個風氣，却漸漸流行到中國來了。朱愛人）問起薜夫人，薛夫人覺得非常抱歉。她說：『我不知道就是你們育嬰院裏的。這是我們那裏有一位技師，他說：有一家三胞胎，很爲活潑可愛。他拿着了幾張照片，就從照片上模擬得來，他說自己還去看過咧。我一時疏忽，沒有問他在那裏看過，這還是新出品呀！眞正對不起了。不知他曾經徵求那孩子的父母和監護人的同意沒有？朱醫師你看這怎麽辦？「朱愛人道：「這也沒有什麽大關係，好在你們也不是把孩子做廣吿，這是出於愛美之心。待我回去，通知他們父母一聲便得了。」邵慧華早把那個兒童泥人，取在手裏。頭面手足露在外面，其除都穿着彩色的衣服，而且可以更換的。薛夫人道：『這是比較　緻一點的，雖說泥人，其寳須和以別種油蠟材料，方能如此美麗，而且也不容易破碎。」她說時，便同玩具店裏商量，把這三胞胎的泥人兒，每人贈送一份。不過林建成金澹雲兩人，一對新夫婦，却合送一份了。停刻兒玩具公司裏仍送還玩具店，此刻不過暫時借一借罷了。邵慧華這時，把這三胞胎的泥人端相一回，忽然的笑道：『薛太太！我們今天又送材料給你們了。』薛夫人道：『什麽材料呀？」邵慧華笑道：『你們公司裏的技師，旣然可以揑塑三胞胎的像，常然也可以揑塑雙胞胎的像了，我們此刻就有一對雙胞胎到這裏來了。一她說時，用手指着何家兩位小姐道；』倘然你們能把這兩位姊姊也製成了泥人，那我一定捧兩個回去，供養在眾了。」金澹雲道：『要是揑塑我們的人像起來，當然先揑塑你。你說塑三胞胎的，就可以塑雙胞胎，我說塑雙胞胎的，更可以塑單胞胎了。』　（二七七）</p>
<h3>生活重壓下　家庭會議</h3>
<p>— 金川</p>
<p>生活的重壓，榨得喘不過氣來，每個的臉上都掛着愁容，尤其是我的母親，終日嘰咕着煤球和米糧的價格，一切使他憂慮和煩悶。昨晚，父親，母親，姊姊和我開了一個家庭會議：母親極力主張搬到淪陷區去，他的理山是：房錢不要，一切的生活比較得低。但父親申以大義，終算把母親說服了。但住在上海又怎辦呢？姊姊發言了，她說：「物價的飛漲，與不能生活，這是整個的問題，我們並不是尸食，我們是工作的，但工作得來的酬報，不得償與生活的價格而餓斃，這不是自己的過失，這是一種「人禍」，造成「人禍」的兇手，當然是另有其人，亦不必明言，但一羣帮兇的，就是這些囤積，操縱的市儈們。要處置市儈們的操縱，希望稍發天良，與當局的限止，這都是無效的，因爲天良是理智的東西，失了理智，就沒有天良；而當局的限價，過去亦是失敗的。市儈有許多手段可以做玄虛，如杜米有限價，但發票上不妨寫上西貢米，諸此頗多。現在我們祇要鼓勵一般爲市儈們服務的職員，苦力取不合作，和檢吿的方法：他要囤積，苦力不與　搬運，堆棧；他要抬高，店員不和他工作，但因此而失業了，全上海的居民，出了錢來救濟他們。」父親說：「這未免太理想了吧！</p>
<p>姊姊回答道：「一點也不理想，在今日的孤島上，就是缺少個領導的人物，同時一般的敎育程度也低劣。當第一次歐戰的時候，我正在倫敦，那裏一切的物價都是政府統制的，要是你家裏囤積了物品的時候，馬上會有人到警察廳去檢發，立刻有警察來查看，課以很多的罰金，並且他們每人對於戰事的囤積，是引爲羞恥的。但在上海，竟沒有辦法實行，還不得不以爲遺憾！」</p>
<p>大家都點點頭，家庭會議就此閉幕。</p>

<h3>影皇米蓋羅納　最崇拜的十大明星</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>本年度電影皇帝米蓋羅納，近影美國著名雜誌LOOK之請求，選出他最崇拜的十大明星，並有幾句簡括的理由，現在摘譯於後：</p>
<p>（一）克拉克蓋博—他是道地的英勇的人物，殘忍中含有情義，粗獷中帶着柔性，像他這樣的個性，恐怕走遍好萊塢找不到第二個。</p>
<p>（二）裘蒂茄倫—當她在歌唱時，是多麼悅耳動人，瀏亮的嗓子，更使我興奮。</p>
<p>（三）瑙瑪希拉—她的演技是多方面的，除了天才兩字，沒有別的字可以形容她。</p>
<p>（四）史賓塞屈賽—沉着，堅毅的作風，是沒有人可與他比較的。</p>
<p>（五）約翰茄非爾—他是年靑的史賓塞屈賽。</p>
<p>（六）亨利方達—他和我一樣並不漂亮，但他又一種特別力量，使得女人對他有好感。</p>
<p>（七）露蓋絲蕾娜—她那弱不禁風的體魄，柔順溫和的姿態，加以多愁善感的表情，在銀幕上不知賺了我多少同情之淚</p>
<p>（八）保羅茂尼—他演起歷史角色來，惟妙惟肖。好萊塢僅她一人有此能幹。</p>
<p>（九）埃洛爾弗林—他的兩道劍眉是英勇的象徵，蔚藍的眼睛包藏着沉毅之氣，可是我最佩服的是他那高大的體格。</p>
<p>泰　鮑華—我希望有他亮晶晶的眸子，帶有俏氣的鼻子，兩片紅唇及一口雪白的牙齒</p>
<h3>影片成績和香煙頭</h3>
<p>— 馨</p>
<p>在英法美各國許多戲院裏，吸煙室准許的，老闆們就拿煙氣的濃薄來測騐所演影片的成績，倘若有許多人吸着煙斗或香煙，就知道觀衆對於這張片子的興趣不夠濃厚。反過來說，假使這片子是很動人的，那麼吸煙的人就比較少了。</p>
<p>散場後，地上所拋棄的香煙頭的長短，更使一種良好的測騐。倘使片子是刺激的動人的，地上必定有許多吸了一半的煙頭，這就表示吸煙的觀衆，剛點上不久，他們的情緒被片子上的演　所吸引去了，所以吸不到一半就拋棄了。假使觀衆對於這片子生厭，那麼地上一定有無　的短煙　拋棄着。</p>
<h3>「中旅」的阿Q正傳</h3>
<p>— 明若水</p>
<p>阿Q在文學上是典型人物的創造。從他身上再現了舊時中國社會的弱點。我同意許廣平女士的話：「阿Q不但是代表中國國民性德弱點，同時也代表世界性德一半民族弱點，尤其農村或被壓迫民族方面，這種典型很可以隨時隨地找得到」</p>
<p>阿Q包含了複雜的性格的多方面；他是可笑的，但更可愛；他是被人鄙視的，但他更值得　同情，應該說「阿Q正傳」是悲劇，不是喜劇。在那些哄笑當中，蘊蓄了無限辛酸的人情味。</p>
<p>「阿Q正傳」之改編為舞台劇是件艱辛的工作。陳瑜的劇本可就是相當成功的。這個劇本的寫作，據說為　者專應「中旅」而作。「中旅」在抗戰後，第一次於武漢將它搬上舞臺，而由洪　導演　造成劇壇　空前的成功紀錄　現在，這個劇國又將它帶給　海地觀衆。</p>
<p>此時此地「阿Q」的演出，無論在劇運與任何方面，都有它重大的意義存在。「封建的殘餘勢力還很大，我們要繼續奮鬭！……」我們應記着劇中第五幕革命者的呼喊。光明將掃蕩這一切腐化的勞力！它帶給我們眞理。這些，對於當前的神聖事業，有着極大的功效。</p>
<p>昨晚，筆者很榮幸地參觀了這劇本的獻演，並認為是一次滿意的欣賞。這次李景波的阿Q，似乎外形不像原著所勾畫的　樣。可是，　周作人從前目　的阿Q，實際上他本人也還比較胖，雖窮並不憔悴，身體頗壯健，　微圓，頗有　天氣象。這樣　，李君倒恰合是人　。</p>

The remnants of the Japanese army lurking around Tongbai have now been completely wiped out. (2) On the Xianghua Road front, yesterday afternoon, the Japanese forces near ZaoYang again attempted to break out to the southeast along the Xianghua Road.

(4) In other areas, the main force of the Chinese army, advancing and withdrawing behind Japanese lines, has now linked up and is searching and attacking Japanese troops scattered in the vast areas of northern and central Hubei.

<h3>The Relief Association Sends Personnel to Guangxi to Discuss Funds</h3>
<p>Chongqing:  Following the victories in northern Guangdong and southern Guangxi this spring, the Relief Committee allocated over 300,000 yuan each for emergency relief.  Subsequently, due to the need to resettle refugees evacuated from the war zones and to promote the early recovery of the region, a special allocation of one million yuan was made to Guangdong Province for post-war reconstruction and relief.  A request was also submitted to the Executive Yuan to allocate one million yuan to Guangxi Province.  Xu Shiying, considering the importance of this matter and the need to extend the central government's benevolence to the people, will send Sun Yafu, the chief secretary of the Central Disaster Relief Preparation Fund Committee, to Guangxi on the 15th to work out post-war relief measures with the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.  After Sun has reached an agreement on relief matters in Guangdong and Guangxi, he will also inspect the relief situation in the war zones of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces to provide a basis for reviewing the administrative plan for relief efforts.

<h3>China is Determined to Fight to the End; Peace Talks are Absolutely Impossible</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today, there were again rumors of peace talks between China and Japan in Shanghai. A Havas news agency correspondent asked a Chinese government spokesman about the matter. The spokesman replied that such rumors are "utterly absurd." China is still determined to fight "until the Japanese army completely withdraws from China." Well-informed sources also stated that the Chinese army recently inflicted a major defeat on the Japanese army in the Xiangfan area, and Japanese attacks in other areas have also been repelled. In this situation, a free China has no need to negotiate peace with Japan. Japan always claims that China is preparing for peace talks whenever it suffers a defeat. This tactic is ridiculous.

<h3>June 1st: Anti-Smoking Propaganda as the Central Task of the National Monthly Meeting</h3>

<h3>The Interior Ministry Formulates a Plan to Improve Local Administration and Promulgates Regulations on Assessing the Performance of Provinces and Municipalities; Senior Officials Will Be Sent to Inspect</h3>
<p>Chongqing: In order to rectify officialdom and establish a modern personnel system, the Ministry of Interior has formulated a plan to improve local personnel administration. The plan includes detailed arrangements for the selection, appointment, treatment, security, training, evaluation, rewards, punishments, and pensions of local administrative personnel at all levels, as well as the punishment of corrupt officials, the inter-transfer of internal and external administrative personnel, and the promotion paths of personnel at all levels, with the aim of comprehensive improvement. This plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry is now actively proceeding with its implementation in phases. In addition, the central government has not had a performance assessment system for senior local officials. To correct this deficiency, the Ministry has drafted provisional regulations on assessing the performance of provinces and municipalities and has submitted them for approval. It is now planned to send senior officials to various provinces and municipalities this year to inspect and implement them in accordance with these regulations. (Telegram of the 14th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Chamberlain and Churchill</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London dispatch reported that the British Churchill Cabinet passed a vote of confidence in the House of Commons on the 12th. Churchill was ordered by the King on the 13th to form a cabinet. Although the selection of some less important cabinet members is still pending, it is legally completed after passing the House of Commons. Moreover, the leaders of all parties have promised to cooperate from the beginning, and the members of all parties have unanimously supported it, achieving complete success politically. Britain is in a time of trouble: the expeditionary force was defeated in Norway, and the small neighboring countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were invaded by a powerful enemy. The overall situation is shocking. The ruling party has an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons, but public opinion is noisy outside, and cracks are visible inside. At this juncture, the central government has been reorganized, not only with a new look, but also with fuller strength, commanding with ease and lifting heavy weights lightly. This is truly due to the superiority of the British people's political knowledge and ability, and also because Churchill is supported by the people. All friends of Britain are pleased.</p>
<p>Churchill and former Prime Minister Chamberlain both belong to the Conservative Party. Churchill was originally the First Lord of the Admiralty in Chamberlain's cabinet and is now Prime Minister, while Chamberlain, as Prime Minister, is now a Privy Councillor in Churchill's cabinet. Others, such as Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary and Minister of Public Security Anderson, and President of the Board of Trade Duncan, are all Conservatives and retain their original positions in Churchill's cabinet. Others, such as the current Secretary of State for War Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood, are also Conservative members. The Lord Chancellor, Simon, is a member of the National Liberal Party. All are cabinet members of Chamberlain's cabinet, and now all retain their positions or transfer departments in Churchill's cabinet. In addition, there are still many who are said to be Conservative members of the new cabinet. However, the significance of this cabinet reshuffle in Britain cannot be regarded as merely a replacement of personnel within a party because the Prime Minister still belongs to the Conservative Party and some cabinet members have either retained or transferred their posts. Nor can it be regarded as merely an opening up of the Conservative Party regime because the leaders of all parties participated in the cabinet under the Conservative Prime Minister. Chamberlain's cabinet was a party cabinet, while Churchill's cabinet is a national cabinet, and their nature is very different. Moreover, the reorganization of the British government from a party cabinet to a national cabinet is not only an important evolution in British politics, but will also have a significant impact on the international community. Why do I say that? Britain's declaration of war on Germany, its alliance with France, its promise to Poland, its efforts to assist Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, its agreement with Turkey, and its guarantee to Greece and Romania are all major factors in the recent and future development of the international situation. They were established during the Conservative Party's Chamberlain cabinet era and are the main part of Britain's international policy in the future and will never be shaken. It is inevitable that the situation is the same, regardless of whether the government is a national cabinet or a cabinet of another party that is not the Conservative Party. Even in terms of friendship with the United States and sympathy for China, and the combination of alarm and attraction to Italy and the Soviet Union, remaining close or apart, making friends or enemies, there are also their own basic conditions. The matter concerns British interests and will not change drastically because the Prime Minister changes. However, the use of power will definitely be different in Churchill's cabinet than in Chamberlain's. As for the international impression given by Churchill and Chamberlain, as well as the possible reaction caused by the impression, we can already see the difference at the beginning of Churchill's administration, when everything has not yet begun.</p>
<p>Chamberlain is a traditional British gentleman. In international affairs, his way of being close or distant, his sense of taking or giving, and his way of handling affairs, making decisions, advancing or retreating, all fit the British rules. However, he was in power for five years and encountered unprecedented changes in the world. His opponents were Stalin of the Soviet Union, Hitler of Germany, Mussolini of Italy, and the cliques of Japan. None of them can be constrained by normal international norms, nor can they be compared to the sentiments of collective habits, nor can they be dealt with by those who hold British traditional rules. Therefore, Chamberlain always went wrong, his plans always failed, and the answers he got always went against the trend he expected. He once declared generously that he would never want to see Britain engaged in cruel and brutal killings again in his lifetime, but he still had to declare war on Germany himself. This alone can summarize the rest. However, he was able to lead his military and civilians to the battlefield with painstaking efforts and by compromising, which ordinary people could not achieve, and he did not lose his status as a British statesman. By the end of his cabinet, not only did other parties feel ashamed to cooperate, but even his own party members abandoned him. The close cabinet members, such as Simon and Hoare, should share the blame. It is also because of five years of mistakes and constant patching up that his objective political achievements had to be abandoned. Moreover, in wartime and post-war, neither domestically nor internationally, Chamberlain's credibility and courage could not command appeal.</p>
<p>As for Churchill, how he will cope with the current difficulties after he takes office as Prime Minister is something that cannot be discussed today. However, there are things that can be predicted: Churchill has a strong and resolute character, and his style is bold and decisive. He is reasonable, decisive, trustworthy, and resolute. Therefore, he can gain the trust of the entire nation regardless of party affiliation. His impression on the international community is also the same. Moreover, it is not only Churchill himself. Foreign Secretary Halifax, the most prestigious cabinet member of the Chamberlain cabinet at home and abroad, sees the Prime Minister as someone who surpasses his predecessors, and Churchill trusts him with his original position. The former Secretary of State for the Colonies, Eden, was transferred to Secretary of State for War. Eden has also served as Foreign Secretary and is famous in the world. He is a new force of the Conservative Party. The Labour Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood not only joined the cabinet, but also held two of the five seats in the cabinet's wartime conference. The Liberal Party leader Sinclair served as Secretary of State for Air. These three represent the two parties, and when they were in opposition, they were most suspicious of Chamberlain's weak Far East policy and repeatedly called for it. In short, those who assist Churchill are lofty and upright, and are all the best of the time. His cabinet lineup is like this, and he should be loved by the whole country. Chamberlain's international policy, although the international community generally recognized that it was not wrong, only because its expression was hesitant and it liked to call it "compromise" and "appeasement," it caused international contempt and suspicion from friendly countries. Now, with Churchill and his important cabinet members, it will show the firmness of its policy, and it will also be feared by those who are contemptuous and trusted by those who are suspicious. Now, in wartime, everything in the end depends on the victory or defeat of the military, but Churchill's cabinet will at least be able to increase the goodwill and confidence of the United States towards Britain, and will be able to increase the practical effect of its sympathy for China, thereby promoting the degree of parallel Anglo-American relations in the Far East. These are the backbone that determines the changes in the international situation in the future.</p>
<h3>German Troops Fiercely Attack, Penetrating French Territory; Europe Opens Unprecedented War; German Troops Advance on Both Wings Centered on Liège; French Garrison Forced to Retreat from Sedan and Longwy</h3>
<p>Paris – Military sources here have recently stated that a major battle occurred between French and German troops along the Meuse River today. The intensity of the situation is unprecedented since the outbreak of the current European war. Ever since German troops invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, they have engaged with French forward units, but these have been skirmishes for the past three days. German troops are actively deploying according to their predetermined strategy, namely, using the city of Liège in Belgium as the center, they are advancing fiercely on both wings. Among them, the strength of the left wing is particularly strong. In addition to a large number of army units and aircraft, there are also two divisions of armored vehicles, which have already passed through the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Ardennes Mountains, and have arrived at the Moselle River. The French "Ardennes Mountain Troops" were immediately forced to retreat. From last night until this morning, German troops began to advance from the city of Liège along the Ourthe River towards the French city of Sedan. As for the east bank of the Meuse River, there was also fighting along the line from the city of Sedan to the Moselle River. After German troops reached the French border, they were fiercely bombarded and intercepted by French defensive batteries, but German troops were finally able to capture the cities of Sedan and Longwy. The fighting in each of these places was quite fierce. German troops continued to use tanks, artillery, and aircraft to bombard French positions and strafe with machine guns. In addition, the air forces of both sides were also extremely active today. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters recently issued a war bulletin stating that German troops, using aircraft and tanks to attack with all their strength, are becoming increasingly fierce in their advance. They have now advanced to the Meuse River, namely, the line from the city of Liège in Belgium, through Namur and Dinant, to the French city of Sedan. Fierce fighting is taking place in the suburbs of Sedan and north of Dinant. At the same time, the fighting along the line from the southern suburbs of the French city of Longwy to the Moselle River is also continuing. The enemy in the Wissembourg area has been repelled by our troops. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris – The great war has now begun, and German troops are mobilizing everywhere. From the Netherlands to the Moselle River, German troops are active everywhere. In the Netherlands, German troops are advancing westward towards Arnhem. 21,500 Dutch troops are currently holding their positions and resisting, and are also clearing German paratroopers or Dutch Nazi Party members in the interior. The work of eliminating the enemy in Rotterdam is still in progress. In Belgium, German mechanized units are departing from Maastricht, Hasselt, and Tongeren, and since yesterday, they have been engaged in the largest mechanized warfare the world has ever seen with French mechanized units. In some places, there are 1,500 to 2,000 tanks facing each other, galloping across the battlefield. French troops have ultimately demonstrated that their fighting power and war equipment are superior to the enemy's. According to the latest news, except for one brick fortress built during the reign of Louis XIV, the forts of Liège in Belgium are all holding firm. Germany is currently making great efforts in the Ardennes region of Belgium. Large formations of German troops are advancing westward, led by several armored divisions, followed by motorized bicycle units, machine gun teams, and tanks, with infantry advancing behind. Seeing the large-scale German offensive, the Belgian and French forward troops are gradually retreating, and fierce fighting has already broken out along the forest area along the Moselle River in front of the Maginot Line. Yesterday, land warfare intensified along the approximately 250-mile front from the Zuiderzee to the Moselle River, and equally fierce aerial encounters also occurred. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The Hague – The Dutch General Headquarters recently issued a war bulletin stating: (1) After German troops crossed the IJssel River in the eastern part of our country, they advanced towards the western part of the Gelderland province and have approached our troop positions in several places. The province has already been flooded. (2) The vanguard of German troops in the northern part of our country has reached the coast of the Zuiderzee in certain places. Our border guards have retreated and suffered slight damage. (3) In the northern part of the Brabant province, German armored vehicle units have reached the city of Langestraat. (4) In the western part of our country, south of the port of Rotterdam, there are still a small number of German paratroop units. Although their weaponry is extremely complete, they do not have artillery. (5) Although the German Air Force has the advantage, our Air Force is still flying to the front lines to bomb enemy military targets. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London – The Belgian radio station broadcast a communiqué from the Belgian General Headquarters stating, "There have been localized contacts at various points on our front. Our troops are currently resisting the enemy's pressure. Last night, our forward units were forced to retreat." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The Commander-in-Chief recently issued a war bulletin stating, "Our troops fought fiercely on the front lines all day today, putting up a determined resistance against the enemy. After several villages and towns were temporarily lost, our troops, with the assistance of Allied tank units, launched a major counter-offensive and recaptured them. Several Belgian army units, infantry units, border bicycle units, Ardennes Mountain troops, and motorized units have fought bravely in recent days and have achieved considerable results." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The Situation in the Netherlands is Extremely Grave; Allied Forces Join Forces to Defend Brussels</p>
<p>London – The vanguard units of the British and French forces in the Netherlands and Belgium have now mobilized to stem the increasingly fierce German offensive. Several million Allied and German troops, assisted by hundreds of aircraft and thousands of tanks each, are currently engaged in a desperate battle along the 150-mile front from the Zuiderzee in the northern Netherlands to the Moselle River. Paris – Well-informed military sources claim that the most important part of the front is the Meuse River area, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. It is expected that the vanguard of German troops in that area will attempt to cross the river today.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the situation in the Netherlands is extremely serious. German troops have made progress in the Arnhem area and are advancing rapidly along both banks of the Rhine River towards Rotterdam. It is possible that they have already reached Rotterdam and joined forces with the German troops occupying the city. The Netherlands is still fighting bravely. A Dutch communiqué stated that Dutch troops' efforts to resist German troops' occupation of the Zuiderzee area have been quite successful. The area north of Rotterdam is definitely in Dutch hands. It is reported that Dutch troops are also holding the Dutch New Water Line. Den Helder is currently unharmed. Zeeland is in Dutch hands, but the situation in Brabant is uncertain.</p>
<p>The most reassuring factor is that the British and French forces, without being significantly harassed by the Germans, are continuing to advance towards their positions in northern and central Belgium. Fighting is still taking place east of the line where the Allied commanders plan to fight a decisive battle with the Germans. Yesterday, French and German armored units fought a major battle all day. Liège is still being held by Belgian troops, and the major battle there has not yet begun. Although the claim that German troops have occupied the Ében-Émael fortress in the north has not been confirmed, it is not impossible. If so, Liège will be cut off. However, Liège is unlikely to fall in the short term, but one should not be overly optimistic.</p>
<p>The vanguard of German troops reached the Meuse River in several places last night and advanced rapidly overnight. It is estimated that they have now reached all the crossing points of the Meuse River. German troops here are heading straight for Sedan. Mechanized units are advancing towards this place. Yesterday, they encountered French troops near Sedan, and there was fierce fighting. German troops have air units and artillery as support. Their second target is Dinant.</p>
<p>Allied troops are now cooperating with Belgian troops to jointly defend Brussels. In the past 48 hours, large numbers of British and French reinforcements and military supplies have arrived in various parts of Belgium. Because Belgian troops put up fierce resistance at the beginning of the sudden German offensive, Allied troops were able to make contact with them in a timely manner without difficulty. Belgian troops have now established strong positions, and large numbers of reinforcements have arrived.</p>
<p>According to opinions in London, the current fighting is still in its initial stages. The situation may not be very clear in two or three days. However, in any case, the great war has definitely begun. The claim that German troops are using nerve gas has not been confirmed, and the claim that German paratroopers have landed behind the French and Allied lines has also not been confirmed. Official circles do not believe this to be the case. However, paratroopers are still landing in large numbers in the Netherlands and Belgium. Traces of them were discovered in Brussels today, and many have been beaten to death by mobs. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London – It has just been reported that the Ében-Émael fortress, north of the city of Liège in Belgium, may have been occupied by German troops, but the war is still ongoing. It is generally believed that the city should still be able to hold out for some time. It is also reported that German paratroop units have landed behind the French and British lines. The fighting in southern Netherlands is also very fierce, and the situation is quite serious. In addition, British and French Allied forces are jointly joining forces with Belgian troops to jointly defend Brussels. It is expected that the great war will break out east of Brussels.

<p>German Troops Launch Large-Scale Offensives Against the Netherlands and Belgium; The Battle Line Stretches 400 Kilometers</p>
<p>Paris – Military sources here recently stated that today German troops launched large-scale offensives in the Netherlands, on both the north and south sides of the city of Liège in Belgium, and at the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with the area west of the Albert Canal being the most intense. French and German tank units both participated in the fighting, with a total of between 1,500 and 2,000 tanks. A summary of the war situation is as follows: (1) German propaganda claimed that the French city of Longwy (at the intersection of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) had been occupied by German troops. This is not true. French troops have very strong positions in that area and have installed obstacles to prevent German troops from advancing. (2) German troops in Belgium are attacking on two routes. One route is north of the city of Liège, advancing from the cities of Hasselt and Tongeren on the Albert Canal. The other route is southwest of the city of Liège, advancing towards the Ardennes Mountains. The motorized units attacking the cities of Tongeren and Hasselt have been subjected to fierce pressure from French troops. Although the situation in the Liège area is currently volatile and uncertain, the area has solid fortifications and can still be held. In addition, German troops are also attacking fiercely in the Ardennes Mountains. Some units, led by armored troops, are advancing towards the Meuse River. The deployment of German troops consists of motorized bicycle units in the first rank, followed by machine gun units, then tank units, with infantry bringing up the rear. The offensive is extremely fierce, and the Belgian and French forward troops are fighting and retreating. (3) Dutch troops are resisting German troops in the Arnhem area quite successfully. German paratroop units landed in the interior of the Netherlands, attempting to make contact with Dutch Nazi Party members. The situation was originally quite serious, but after Dutch police and troops searched and suppressed them, most have been eliminated, and the authorities have been able to control the overall situation. In summary, after Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, it extended the battle line from the Moselle River to the coast of the Zuiderzee in the Netherlands, a distance of 400 kilometers. In addition, the air forces of both sides were as active as usual on the front lines today. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the air forces of Britain and France have shot down more than 400 German aircraft in those countries. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The Main Defense Lines in the Eastern Periphery of the Netherlands and Belgium Were Breached by German Mechanized Units</p>
<p>Berlin – The German General Headquarters issued a war bulletin this afternoon stating that the Grebbe Line southeast of Amersfoort in the Netherlands has been breached by our troops. Continued reinforcements are heading south to the Dutch fortress area. The city of Roosendaal has been occupied by our troops. In Belgium, after our troops crossed the Turnhout Canal, they have now advanced to De Groote Geete. North of Namur, our motorized units are currently pursuing enemy motorized units. The city of Liège is in our hands. From Liège to Namur, our troops have crossed the Ardennes. The outposts have advanced to the Meuse River between Namur and Huy. Our troops are also making extremely rapid progress in southern Belgium. At the junction of Belgium, France, and Luxembourg, our troops have broken into French territory in several places. Yesterday, the enemy lost a total of 150 aircraft, and our troops lost 27 aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Belgian Front – Yesterday, German troops used flanking maneuvers to break through the first line of defense of the Belgian troops. After putting up a strong resistance, the Belgian troops retreated to the second line of defense. It is expected that the British Expeditionary Force will join the second line of defense to fight the first major battle. This line is shorter than the first line, so it is stronger. German troops used armored units to penetrate the Belgian defense lines and continued their offensive. The German equipment can be described as extremely perfect. The Allied forces expressed great excitement over the heroic resistance of the Dutch troops. It is expected that a major battle will take place between British and German troops in Belgium within the next few days. When German troops crossed a certain bridge in Maastricht, they formed a circular umbrella-shaped formation, attacking the left and right wings of the Belgian troops and forcing them to retreat. According to a statement from the Belgian side, the German paratroop units behind the Allied lines were all surrounded in the shortest possible time. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German military experts yesterday issued a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, declaring that after occupying northeastern Netherlands with swift action, German troops are now actively advancing. German mechanized units have made contact with army units that were transported by air and landed in Rotterdam. The so-called Dutch fortress has been surrounded. Between Moerdijk and The Hague, German troops have the advantage. The use of new German tactics has created a favorable military situation in the Netherlands. On the Belgian side, on the third day of operations, German troops have eliminated the Albert Canal defense line. The Liège fortress has not been completely overcome. Enemy troops are still stubbornly resisting in the eastern forts, but the capture of the Ében-Émael fortress proves the invincibility of modern German weapons. On the air front, several British aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing of the Maastricht bridge yesterday at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 meters. German anti-aircraft guns shot down 25 aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>German Troops Claim to Have Gained Important Strongholds in the Dutch Fortress Area</p>

This area extends from Hilversum, through Utrecht, Dordrecht, Rotterdam, The Hague, the Dutch coast, and ends at the island of Vlieland in the north. As far as the current war situation is concerned, German troops are pressing the enemy from the south, and it is hoped that the garrison in the "Dutch Fortress" area will lay down their arms and surrender. On the Belgian side, the country's main defense line, the Albert Canal, has been breached by German troops. Belgian troops are under German pressure and are currently retreating westward. The Liège fortress, one of the important strongholds along the Albert Canal, has now been occupied by German troops. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Germany Concentrates its Main Force to Pressure the Border, Aiming to Cut Off Contact Between Belgian and Dutch Armies</p>
<p>London – The German army is now focusing all its efforts on cutting off the land army between Belgium and the Netherlands. The defense measures of the Netherlands and Belgium were not coordinated in advance, so the Allies expect Germany to push its main force to the Dutch-Belgian border to the North Sea. If this advance is successful, Germany will not only divide the Netherlands and Belgium into two parts, but it can also threaten the defenses of Antwerp and the Albert Canal. German troops are currently advancing on three routes: one from Maastricht to Brussels, one advancing towards Roermond, and one from Liège, forcing the Meuse route into France, the same as in 1914. Each route of advance is protected by aircraft, and paratroop units are landing behind the lines to assist in the attack. After the start of the war, the roads and railways between the Netherlands and Belgium were repeatedly bombed by German aircraft. Air Force intelligence reported that the Royal Air Force destroyed two bridges in the Maastricht area yesterday, because German troops were attacking Belgium from that area. The Royal Air Force also attacked German troops advancing towards Belgium. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Dutch Government Denies Allowing Third Country to Interfere in the Sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies; Dutch Embassy in Japan Issues Statement; British Troops Land on Curaçao Island</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo News: Mr. Van Gulik, secretary of the Dutch Embassy in Japan, issued a statement denying that the Dutch government has allowed a third country to interfere in the sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies. It roughly stated that no matter what the situation in the Netherlands is, we are determined to reject any third party interfering with our territories. We are fully prepared to maintain our own sovereignty. The rumor that the Dutch West Indies have been occupied by the Allied forces is completely untrue. It so happens that a French warship sailed to the West Indies to purchase goods there. Its sailors also landed there, but it was not an occupation. Mr. Wan continued to say that on the 13th, the various branches of the Dutch Bank had received orders from the government to pay back all the funds that German expatriates had deposited before May 10th, without exception, and were not allowed to withhold them.

<h3>Dutch and Belgian People, Supporting the Old and Leading the Young, Flee to English and French Borders for Refuge; Repeatedly Describe the Brutal Acts of the German Army; The Tragedy of Twenty Years Ago Reappears Today</h3>
<p>Paris: The tragic scenes of 1914 have reappeared in Paris yesterday. Countless elderly, women, and children have arrived here in dismay from the cities that have crossed the border for refuge. The French army is busily setting up Belgian refugee camps in Paris and arranging beds for the refugees. Nurses are distributing food to the refugees. The displaced people are able to find temporary shelter in these simple places. Most of these Belgians are able to recount the tragic scenes they encountered in the war, repeatedly telling of the terror of German bombing. It is said that at this time, the cruel German planes showed no mercy to the people who were rushing to the French border for refuge. According to an old woman, when she fled her home in panic and ran along a road close to the German front line, her two sons who were traveling with her were shot and killed by German machine guns. She was unable to take care of her sons' bodies and bravely continued her journey, arriving here after many hardships. Now she has no clothes or money. Many Belgian refugees have encountered similar situations, and most do not know the fate of their missing family members. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>British House of Lords Unanimously Passes Vote of Confidence in New Government; Halifax Proposes Motion and Praises Chamberlain's Contributions; Third Batch of Cabinet Members Announced</h3>
<p>London: When Foreign Secretary Halifax proposed a motion of confidence in the new government in the House of Lords, he delivered a speech praising the achievements of former Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that anyone who knew his achievements would not worry about what kind of judgment history would make on his efforts to mediate peace or his efforts to conduct the war after the breakdown of peace. He then mentioned the new Prime Minister Churchill, saying that Mr. Churchill has undertaken the extremely heavy responsibility of the work that is commonly known in the House of Lords, and he will use his special talent that is trusted by the people to deal with this work. The House of Lords immediately passed this motion unanimously. The new Lord Chancellor, Sir John Simon, attended the House of Lords today. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London: New Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak amidst cheers, saying that on Friday evening, I was ordered to form a new government. Parliament and the nation all wished the new government to be built on the broadest foundation and to recruit all parties in the House of Commons who supported and opposed the previous government. In accordance with this wish, I have now completed this most important task and formed a war cabinet of five people to represent the unity of the nation. The leaders of the Labour Party have all taken office. Given the extreme urgency of the situation, the war cabinet had to be announced within a day. The other important positions were appointed yesterday, and another list will be submitted to the King for approval tonight. I hope that the appointments of the main officials can be announced tomorrow, and the rest will have to wait a little longer. However, I think this part of my work can be completed by the time the parliament meets next time, and the organization of the government will be completed in all aspects. For the sake of the public interest, I believe that it is necessary to convene the parliament today, and the Speaker also thinks so. Therefore, in accordance with his authority, he convened this meeting. After today's meeting, it is planned to ask the House of Commons to adjourn until May 21, but it will be convened in advance if necessary. The events that need to be considered at that time will be notified to the members of parliament as soon as possible. I now ask the House of Commons to pay attention to the proposed resolution, so as to express its agreement with the steps I have taken and to declare its trust in the new government. The organization of this mixed government is a major event in itself, but we must know that we are at the initial stage of the greatest war in history. We are engaged in war in many places in the Netherlands and Belgium. We must also be prepared in the Mediterranean. In addition, we must make various arrangements in the country. In this environment, I think I can be forgiven for speaking briefly today. If there are any omissions in etiquette, I hope that friends and colleagues will forgive me. I have told all the major officials who have joined the government that I have nothing to offer except blood, toil, tears, and sweat. Before us are long struggles and hardships. If anyone asks what our goal is, I can answer it in one sentence, that is, victory, no matter what the cost, no matter what the danger, no matter what the hardship, we must win, because we must know that without victory, the British Empire cannot exist, what the British Empire advocates cannot exist, and the era of human beings moving toward their goals cannot exist. However, I take up my work with a lively spirit and hope. This day requires the help of all, so I call out, let each rise up and move forward with the united strength of our people.</p>
<p>Labour Party member Clement Attlee stood up from his previous seat and spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, saying that the Labour Party immediately trusts the motion of the new government. Our country has achieved unity today through discussion, advice, and goodwill, but in other countries, unity is sought through detention camps, batons, and execution platforms. In less than two days after the cabinet upheaval last week, the war cabinet has been produced, and the new national defense officials have also taken office. The unity of the United Kingdom can be seen from this. David Lloyd George seconded, saying that I am one of the new Prime Minister's old friends. I congratulate him on taking office. I know his talent, perseverance, and his deep research and experience in war, all of which are urgently needed today. Now that he is in the highest position, I am deeply pleased to have found the right person. He exercises the highest responsibility in the most serious and difficult period that British Prime Ministers have ever encountered. All friends of freedom in the world wish him success. The hopes of the world are concentrated on him and pray for him. According to my observation, the United Kingdom and the British Empire are willing to offer their sacrifices for his command.

<h3>British New Government's Far East Policy: Commentary from Chongqing Ta Kung Pao</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao here recently published an editorial entitled "Asking the British New Cabinet's Foreign Policy", with quite blunt wording. Because it is a non-partisan newspaper, the tone expressed in the article can generally reflect the current views of the Chinese people. The article first calls Churchill a capable and diligent leader, saying that we are in this critical autumn of the European war, and it seems that it is not the time for us to ask the British new cabinet to state its Far East policy. However, there is something that we must point out, that is, if Mr. Churchill is not a decisive figure, we can save ourselves the trouble, because even if we ask, there will be no result. Now that Mr. Churchill has always expressed deep concern about Far East affairs and is a figure who embraces an active policy, we would like to raise this issue of mutual benefit to China and Britain. We frankly admit that in recent months, the general Chinese people have expressed concern about the possibility of a British-Japanese compromise. We are not very optimistic about it. It is not that we believe that Chamberlain is unwilling to compromise with Japan, but that this issue is not only related to Britain. According to our opinion, non-intervention is compromise. The British Foreign Office has recently declared that the British Far East policy has not changed and that it will not abandon the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, after careful consideration, we can assert that there is not much difference whether the British Far East policy has changed or not. Britain's trade has been destroyed by Japan, and its rights have been trampled on, but Britain has always tolerated it without taking any action. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has often requested compromise and understanding from Japan. Therefore, the British declaration that the Far East policy has not changed is actually empty talk, and there is reason to fear that it has secretly changed in fact, from passive compromise to active compromise. According to the opinions of various commentators, the late Chamberlain government was indeed willing to compromise with Japan. If Japan agreed to restore the Anglo-Japanese alliance or to reach an Anglo-Japanese understanding to maintain favorable neutrality for the British side in the European war, we can determine that Chamberlain would have accepted it. But why has the above situation not been realized? First, Japan wants another Anglo-Japanese alliance. Anti-British sentiment among the Japanese is quite strong, and Craigie's small actions are not enough to move the Japanese. The more humble Craigie's demeanor, the more arrogant Foreign Minister Hata becomes. Second, the American government and the public are against the policy of compromising with Japan. Because of the importance of the United States in the current European war, Craigie's policy has not been thoroughly implemented in the Chamberlain cabinet. Therefore, the failure of the Anglo-Japanese compromise is not due to the British policy, but to the policies of the United States and Japan. The main foreign policy of the Chinese government in the past ten years has always been pro-British. This situation is especially true among the Chinese people. Friendship with Britain is completely the same as with the Soviet Union and the United States. The reason is that British public opinion, especially the cultural class, is quite sympathetic to China. British officials and people in China and nearby areas such as Hong Kong and Singapore have all provided valuable assistance to China. The Chinese people are rich in emotion and understand the difficulties of others. Craigie's policy has caused Chinese people to wring their wrists but not to oppose it fiercely. We hope that Churchill will first decide who is the true friend and enemy of Britain in the Far East. He should not continue to compromise with the enemy but must provide effective assistance to the friend. We deeply know the significance of this war to Britain. At this critical time, Britain can no longer afford to have disputes with Japan. We understand this very well. However, attitude is one thing and policy is another. Unfortunately, Craigie's various activities last year have gone beyond the scope of attitude and are indeed the policy of the United Kingdom. Although Britain cannot adopt an anti-Japanese attitude, it can assist China. Britain has lent 25 million pounds to Turkey. What about its loans to China? I am afraid that the amount is far less than that lent to Romania. Britain currently needs 6 million pounds for daily war expenses. If it can use three days of expenses to assist China, its effect will be quite considerable. If Britain is prepared to fight for three years, then these three days of military spending will be a very great contribution to stabilizing the Far East situation, which would be negligible for its entire military budget.

<h3>New York Foreign Exchange Market: Pound Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>New York: Today, the pound exchange rate in the foreign exchange market has fallen due to the news that Germany has continued to make progress in the Netherlands and Belgium, and the lack of demand for the pound. However, speculators have bought in slightly. The opinions of military observers that Germany may launch a fierce air attack on the British Isles in the future are also the reasons for the fall in exchange rates. The opening was at $3.22, and the closing was at $3.16. The previous closing was at $3.28 to $3.31. This bank price feels that the pound's transaction has decreased, and it is expected that the list of goods that must be paid according to the official market exchange rate will be expanded, and the market will also be depleted. Currently, only a few thousand pounds of transactions can cause very large fluctuations. It is reported that exporters who have already received pounds that cannot be converted into US dollars according to the official market exchange rate have mostly hedged them out, so their losses will not be significant. The saying from London that it advocates controlling all pounds to avoid fluctuations in the price of free pounds is quite noticeable here. Those who say that Britain wants to expand control are easy to do, but it is doubtful that Britain is willing to risk losing gold or foreign exchange for unnecessary things. The French franc also continued to fall, with an opening of 1.815 and a closing of 1.79. The same is true for the Swiss franc, with an opening of 22.40 and a closing of 22.20.

<h3>Anti-British Sentiment Rises Throughout Italy; Parliamentarians Accuse Britain and France of Monopolizing Oil Interests; Roman Students Stage Anti-British Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Rome: The outcry against Britain and France has recently become more vocal in the Italian Upper House. Italian Upper House members have criticized Britain and France for monopolizing oil in Europe, preventing Italy from achieving self-sufficiency in oil. Senator Gayda made an even more impassioned speech this morning, saying that Prime Minister Mussolini will immediately work to resolve Italy's oil demands. Gayda claimed that, although Britain and the United States control gasoline, Italy's opportunity is coming, and the opportunity will come once the situation changes. All the famous gasoline locations are in the hands of Britain and France, while Italy has none. "The oil problem can be completely and actively resolved. I dare to believe that the Prime Minister will make Italy break away from this serious monopoly restriction." Senator Burzio recently spoke in the Upper House, believing that democratic countries are hindering Italy's self-sufficiency. Because once Italy can obtain oil, Italy's national power will increase. Wealthy countries such as Britain and France are all enemies of Italy, because these people are suspicious of Italy and regard Italy as an enemy. These wealthy countries may soon lose power, because science has become a powerful tool for the proletariat. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome: Students throughout Italy held demonstrations against the Allied contraband controls. Thousands of students in Rome paraded through the main streets, gathered in front of the Prime Minister's residence, and cheered Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister appeared on the balcony. The students later gathered in front of the palace, expressing their loyalty to the royal family and supporting the Prime Minister and the navy. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome: Foreign Minister Ciano released a memorandum yesterday detailing the damage to Italy's overseas trade caused by the British and French blockade policies. Newspapers here have reported it in a big way. "L'Osservatore Romano" also published an article, strongly criticizing the British naval inspection methods, roughly saying that this method is no different from piracy. We can hardly tolerate this any longer. The rights and prestige of the Italian nation have been trampled to this extent. This is unbearable. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian news agency said that demonstrations against the Allied powers' abuse of contraband control laws have continued to occur in Italy. Police teams have now been added outside the British and French embassies and other consulates in Rome for protection. The general public is now increasingly resentful of those who buy and sell the "L'Osservatore Romano" published by the Vatican, because the "L'Osservatore Romano" commented on the heroic state of resistance of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, pointing out that the all-out war started by Germany has clearly shown that this is a war of annihilation without any psychological hesitation and also in violation of the laws of war.

<h3>How Will Italy's Attitude Evolve? Depends on the Situation in Belgium</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable but not yet officially confirmed sources, the Italian government recently provided assurances to the US ambassador, stating that it has no intention of immediately changing its current policy. However, political figures here say that it is necessary to be cautious about how Italy's attitude will evolve. The German and Italian governments have indeed been actively discussing the issue of troop passage recently. As of now, no decision has been made. However, the Italian authorities have clearly made many efforts to stir up anti-British and anti-French public opinion in the country. In short, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has not yet made a final decision on the issue of joining the war at this time. However, it would be too much of an illusion to think that the Italian Prime Minister might take into account the advice of the Vatican or moral concepts and abandon his plan. Therefore, the new guarantee recently provided by the Italian government to the United States, its validity period, I am afraid that it will be no more than two or three weeks at most. The situation of the battle in the Flemish region of Belgium will probably decide what decision the Italian Prime Minister will make in the future. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Asks Congress to Increase Defense Spending</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt recently sent a special message to Congress, requesting an additional $63 million in supplementary defense funds in addition to the existing naval and army fees of $2 billion. Among the uses of these funds, $3.5 million will be used to purchase raw materials for defense projects required for military strategy and to cope with emergency situations, and the remaining $2.9 million will be used for the army to develop coastal defenses in Puerto Rico. President Roosevelt also said in his message that the above two expenses are urgently needed and should be resolved immediately. Congress also agrees with the President's claim, and the case is expected to pass quickly. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Neutrality Issues in the Americas: US Government Has No Intention of Accepting Argentine Foreign Minister's Proposal</h3>
<p>Washington: Argentine Foreign Minister Cantilo recently made a proposal, advocating that the countries of the Americas should change their current neutral attitude to a "non-belligerent" attitude, so as to leave room for flexibility, just like Italy's attitude towards the current European war. When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, the reporters asked for the government's views on the matter. According to the answer, the United States government is always prepared to carefully study any proposals made by any country, but this does not mean that it will always be accepted. Informed sources say that the State Department has already decided not to accept this proposal. There are two main reasons: (1) The so-called "non-belligerent" attitude has never been recognized by international law. (2) This attitude will conflict with the current Neutrality Act, and the amendment of the Neutrality Act must be approved by the people and Congress. Moreover, if the government authorities were to change course, not only would it be subject to criticism from isolationists across the country, but Japan would also regard it as a threat to the current state of the Dutch East Indies, thereby fueling its ambitions. For this reason, Foreign Minister Cantilo's proposal does not seem to be immediately submitted by the countries of the Americas for discussion. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>US Congressmen Debate National Defense Issues, Advocate Occupation of Certain Islands</h3>

<h3>Wang Chung-hui Broadcasts to the US, Expresses Concern for the Future of the Dutch East Indies, Japan May Take Action, Crisis Increasing in the Philippines, etc.</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui, in a broadcast speech to the United States tonight, expressed China's concern about the future of the Dutch East Indies as a result of Japan's recent declaration. He said, "A year ago, we pointed out that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island in China would be used as a stepping stone to threaten the Pacific possessions of various countries. Today, Japan has indeed stated in its declaration that it intends to place the Dutch East Indies under its protection, resulting in increased danger to the Philippines, the Straits Settlements, French Vietnam, and Australia. We are particularly concerned about what actions Japan may take in the Dutch East Indies, as there are over one million overseas Chinese there, who have made significant contributions to economic development and have substantial investments." Wang also stated that China's foreign policy has not changed in the recent developments in the international situation, and "we will not cease our resistance until our goals are achieved." (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui, in a broadcast speech tonight, briefly stated: "Although there have been many recent developments in the international situation, China's foreign policy remains the same as before. We are as determined as ever to resist Japanese aggression, and we will not lay down our arms until the Japanese militarists repent, regardless of how long the war may be prolonged. Recalling that we pointed out a year ago that after the Japanese militarists occupied our Hainan Island, they would use it to threaten the possessions of various countries in the Pacific, it is now clear from the statements issued by the Japanese side that the country's intention to covet the Dutch East Indies has been completely exposed. The impact of this is that the Philippine Islands, the Malay Peninsula, French Vietnam, and the Commonwealth of Australia have all been subjected to greater crises. It is estimated that the number of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is over one million, and the amount of their investment is particularly considerable. Therefore, if Japan takes any action in the Dutch East Indies, we cannot remain indifferent." (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Finance Chip Abundance Seen, US Exchange Once Exited the Five Yuan Mark, Trading Quite Active, Situation Quite Chaotic</h3>

As for the domestic market situation, long positions continued to be favored. The US exchange once exited the five yuan mark. Rumors also spread of German forces breaking through the Maginot Line, causing a run on deposits at a certain foreign bank in this city. Many positions were resold on the black market. Chinese and Western speculators were frantically selling, so amidst abundant supply and limited demand, prices gradually softened. Although the price temporarily stopped falling due to Hua's bank's buying, unexpectedly, rumors spread of Abe flying to Chongqing, suggesting a peaceful atmosphere between China and Japan. Selling pressure reignited, and buyers were scarce. The British exchange rose to three shillings seventy-five. The May US exchange reached the five yuan mark. Around 11:30, a certain British bank bought in slightly better, and the selling pressure had subsided, gradually softening.

As a result, public sentiment was chaotic. Chinese and Western speculators continuously dumped, with abundant chips, causing prices to continue to ease. Initial negotiators, speculators, and Sassoon's American bank jointly sold May British exchange to British banks for three shillings five nine three seven five and five six two five. Before long, spot British exchange was absorbed by British banks as low as three shillings seven eight seven five, and even seventy-five. The hardest spot US dollar had traded at five yuan.

<h3>Sharp Drop in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, as various rumors circulated, were all beneficial to sellers, such as the German army suddenly attacking the Maginot Line, Allied war matters generally considered unfavorable. Affected by this, a major foreign bank in this city experienced a run on deposits. In addition, rumors about peace between China and Japan resurfaced. This statement was even more unfounded, but the general belief caused people to stir up trouble, with large-scale activities. Gold prices fell to nineteen yuan three jiao eight fen in the afternoon.

<h3>Rumors Rampant, Gold Market Unsightly, Foreign Exchange Softness Intensifies, Price Seen at 6460 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation of the cash gold black market, the severity of the decline, was truly unprecedented, with a downward trend of a thousand miles. Operators were uneasy, especially those with long positions who suffered a great blow and were at a loss. Therefore, although the price fluctuations were huge, transactions were lacking. The reasons for the sharp decline were nothing more than rampant rumors. Among them, the recent great victories of the Chinese army and the speculation of peace between China and Japan, and the United States possibly entering the war, the bleak future of gold, and the rumor that German forces had broken through the Maginot Line, causing a run on deposits at foreign banks in this city, made the foreign exchange market extraordinarily soft, and the gold market followed suit. In the entire day, the initial drop was only thirty-five yuan, and then continued to decline. Although the foreign exchange market softened and recovered slightly, the lowest price before noon had reached six thousand five hundred eighty yuan. After the market opened, gold shops bought in, raising the opening price to seven hundred yuan. Before long, the softening trend in the foreign exchange market intensified, plunging to six thousand four hundred sixty yuan. At that time, securities firms and money changers were selling the most aggressively. Later, because the peace rumors were false, a certain securities firm searched for people, and it had risen back to six thousand six hundred fifty yuan. As a result, public sentiment was weak, and those with long positions began to close out their positions, with the closing price remaining only six thousand five hundred seventy yuan, a sharp drop of three hundred twenty-five yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day's trading volume was approximately three thousand several hundred taels. Jewelry gold was listed at thirty yuan less, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Plunges Over Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially because the foreign exchange rate fell, but the US exchange in this city tightened and then softened again, public sentiment remained weak. At the opening, Shou Shan Gold Shop issued twenty taels to money changers at six thousand eight hundred sixty yuan, less thirty-five yuan compared to the previous day. Subsequently, because gold shops and a certain money changer competed to sell, and there were still few buyers, the price dropped another seventy yuan. The gold shop issued ten taels to a silver shop, for only six thousand seven hundred ninety yuan. Soon the foreign exchange market stabilized slightly, and the selling pressure eased, and another money changer and silver shop bought in quite a lot, resulting in a rise of sixty yuan. The silver shop took in a total of fifty taels from peers and others for six thousand eight hundred fifty yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, selling pressure resurfaced, as the market was filled with negative rumors, coupled with a sharp softening in the foreign exchange market, gold shops and securities firms competed to sell off, and a certain money changer came again to aggressively dump, and there were few buyers, and soon there was a sharp drop of two hundred seventy yuan. Silver shops did business with each other for ten taels, for only six thousand five hundred eighty yuan. By the closing time, the foreign exchange market had recovered slightly, so the market situation changed slightly, and a certain money changer and gold shop mutually re-entered to recover an increase of eighty yuan. The money changer entered thirty taels to the silver shop, for six thousand six hundred sixty yuan as the noon closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, gold shops raised prices to buy, reaching a slight increase. Gold shops entered thirty taels for silver brokers, for six thousand seven hundred yuan. However, at this time, sellers arose from all sides, doing business over the counter for fifty yuan less. Later, because the foreign exchange market softened, sellers came in an endless stream, and securities firms and money changers sold out in particular, and buyers were extremely cautious, so there was another sharp drop of two hundred yuan. The silver shop issued ten taels to the gold shop, for six thousand four hundred sixty yuan. It was stopped when the foreign exchange market stopped softening and started to recover, and the rumors that the peace rumors between China and Japan were inaccurate in the morning, which suddenly caused a buying frenzy. Silver brokers and another securities broker competed to drag in, and soon it rose by one hundred ninety yuan. The silver shop entered ten taels to the gold shop, for six thousand six hundred fifty yuan. After entering, the buyers reduced, and the price fell downward again. A certain securities firm came to spit out as much as it could, and it retreated to six thousand five hundred seventy yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell sharply by three hundred twenty-five yuan compared to the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, for a total drop of five hundred twenty yuan. After the close, it was ten yuan lower according to the evening closing price, and there were still few recipients. The entire market fluctuated by four hundred yuan.

The major firms changed to six hundred seventy yuan. The new firms had the same price as above, with the purchase reduced by about thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers, People's Hearts Timid, Yarn Market Plunges, Double Horse Falls Seventy Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market plunged, and fell in a straight line. This was because the foreign exchange was lengthening, the price of gold was falling, and at the same time, rumors were rampant, and the market situation was as chaotic as hemp.</p>
<p>The initial opening of the spot yarn market was still peaceful. Because the foreign exchange rate changed to shrink, the spot price of 20s Double Horse was one thousand six hundred ten yuan, rising to twelve yuan. Then, rumors spread like a swarm, long positions sold out, and at the same time, the US exchange rose, and the selling pressure was great, falling to one thousand five hundred forty-five yuan. The transaction statistics for half a day totaled one thousand five hundred twenty bales, and the spot price of 20s Double Horse fell seventy yuan. The amount of purchases from various groups is listed on the left, peers 765, Hong Kong 755, totaling 1,520.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Also Plunges</h3>

The market situation changed due to the lengthening of the foreign exchange and the change in people's hearts. Due to this, the cotton market fell sharply, and the market situation was even more frustrated. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>

<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was quite firm yesterday. Steel stocks fell sharply, but the cotton market, due to purchases from industry and short covering, resulted in the closing price being four or five points higher than the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and the price was estimated to fall four rupees. Egypt was closed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction, there were many rumors from all sides yesterday. Peers, in the midst of this storm, plan to temporarily take a wait-and-see attitude.

<h3>Securities, Foreign Stocks Plunge, Domestic Bonds Advance</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities grey market experienced an unexpected surge in prices, with a very strong trend. At the same time, the foreign exchange lengthened significantly, and gold and various commodities all fell sharply. Rumors arose in the market, some said ×× went to Chongqing, and the atmosphere for peace was strong. The market situation, which had been weak and listless for many days, suddenly became excited. Type A shares surged to over sixty yuan, and Type E shares broke out of the fifty yuan mark. The afternoon was especially firm, but the peace rumors had no basis. The sharp declines in other various sectors were entirely due to the poor situation in Holland and Belgium, and changes in the European war. Moreover, because it was impossible to determine the benefits and drawbacks, this trend was mostly a psychological effect. There are still many changes in the future, and one cannot stick to one view. Buyers from various accounts, such as Tiansheng, Lianyi, Yitai, and retail investors, continued to buy. Others such as Yitai, Zhongyi, Yikang, Yongkang, Hongda, and No. 64 also bought in successively. Long positions from Lianhe suddenly emerged again. Tongkang consistently sold off. Taifeng, Wufeng, Yichang, and Hongkang all sold off. The market price still rose sharply due to the demand exceeding the supply. The result was a consistent increase of six or seven jiao to one yuan and five fen, with a transaction volume of approximately one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 60.10 59.35 60.00 Up 0.90</p>
<p>Unified B 51.85 50.90 51.85 Also 0.95</p>

<p>Unified E 45.65 49.65 50.6 Also 1.00</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Share Exchange opened yesterday. Because the New York stock market had plunged the night before, prices were unsupported from the start. Later, the selling pressure intensified, to the point that buyers did not dare to bid. It was not until the last half hour before the evening closing that prices turned around. The losses were very large for English unions, Jardine Matheson, and various industrial stocks. International Trust and Yangtzekiang Silver Company each announced dividends of one and a half yuan, so the prices of the two were firm. Yangtzekiang shares fluctuated within a very narrow price range, unlike the large fluctuations of other well-known shares. The plunge was also severe, and the East India companies were under heavy selling pressure again.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains, Bean Cake Sales Develop</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market situation was still weak before firm, and the result was that because the external atmosphere was sluggish, yesterday's soybean cake sales were still active. In addition to the Shantou gang's half-installed and half-hearted sales, other gangs from Xiamen and various inland towns continued to inquire, so the trend in the morning maintained its shape. However, the afternoon was affected by the atmosphere, and the situation could not help but be shaken, and the transaction was diminished. A total of 6,000 zhang of Siyi Chang's brand cake was sold, priced at eleven yuan four jiao half to eleven yuan three jiao half. 300 zhang of Pudong Sheng Sheng's brand cake were priced at ten yuan six jiao half. 1 car of Changzhou Puli's brand Fatty character cake was priced at ten yuan seven jiao, and 3,000 zhang of Yantai cake were priced at eleven yuan to ten yuan eight jiao, it was said.</p>
<h3>Grains, Foreign Rice Rises Six Yuan in Recent Days, Japonica and Indica Rice Rise to Fifty-Three or Four Yuan</h3>
<p>In recent times, the rice market has tightened again, rising every day, and yesterday's rise was still strong. The price of various foreign rice reached the highest peak of fifty-four yuan for number one Saigon and fifty-two yuan for Little Twist again for the previous time. In these few days, it has suddenly increased by a huge six yuan, which shows the ferocity of recent rice price changes. It is difficult to reconcile the rising prices of foreign rice producing areas. Subsequently, no further purchases were ordered, so the bottom of the Shanghai depot is now measurable. Moreover, as the European war intensifies and affects the future in many ways, it is rumored that the original merchants have a firmer mindset. Not only are they trying to hold firm, but they are also buying in monthly. Therefore, when there is an inquiry, the shouting rises repeatedly, and the actual needs are purchased regardless of the price. Inland village customers continue to release prices to search for various goods, and the prices have been seen to rise repeatedly under the mutual climbing. Unexpectedly, the market became tighter, and the general mindset was extremely chaotic. As soon as Saigon Little Twist reached the peak of the previous level, those who profited took advantage of the high price to sell their goods high, and then number one Saigon fell back to fifty-three yuan, and Little Twist fell to fifty-one yuan, a drop of one yuan. Knowing that the low price had just been issued, the short covering rose again, and the situation immediately became charming again, and the original market was restored in an instant. From then on, it was constantly fluctuating, and there were many changes, hovering back and forth, often with yuan worth of fluctuations. However, in the end, it could not penetrate the previous market, the new peak, and finally closed with fifty-four yuan for Saigon and fifty-two yuan for Little Twist, which was about one and a half yuan higher than the previous market closing price.</p>
<p>Since the domestic glutinous rice has recently been hoarding by large households, and the sales have turned strong, the market has reversed its previous state. Yesterday, although foreign rice continued to rise, its momentum was not as exciting as before, resulting in a price increase of only half a yuan to nearly a yuan. The price of Liyang Special yuan was 46 yuan 3 jiao, Jintan Special yuan 46 yuan 4 jiao, 5 jiao, 8 jiao, Changdan High yuan 44 yuan, 5 yuan, the market price was 42 yuan, 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica is still scarce in its source, and the external dark market rumors about foreign rice are going hand in hand, opening is done in bulk, and the price is also rising by more than one yuan. Wuxi Special Clear billet 53 yuan and 4 yuan, Fen Japonica 52 yuan and 3 yuan, Chang Kun Japonica 52 yuan and 3 yuan, second grade to 51 yuan or so, Qing Si thin rice 52 yuan half, second grade to 51 yuan, Nan Gang early rice 51 yuan and so on.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Transactions Quiet Again</h3>
<p>The flour market was quiet again yesterday. This street's actual sales were sluggish due to the rain, and the purchase appetite was slow. Those directly approved by the factories were less than 5,000 bags. The return of the goods, buying and selling are both silent. The price of old brand warehouse orders is roughly the same as the factory price. Inland flour sales have also weakened. Only Shunfeng brand has opened at thirteen yuan eight jiao five fen, with occasional retail transactions. Japanese merchants are one-dimensional and still for wheat transactions, and sales from Chinese factories and export merchants are still sluggish. The listing of new wheat is getting closer, and the harvest is predicted to be abundant, so the old wheat market has already been declining, and the official transaction must wait for the new wheat to be listed.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Floating Hoarding and Dumping, Cloth Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's domestic cloth market, the foreign exchange loosened, and gold and yarn prices all fell together. Due to the daily decline in actual sales, holders of cloth goods had floating thoughts and dumped sales. The market's downward trend gradually intensified, with fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth down by five jiao to one yuan and a half, and bleached and dyed cloth down by about one yuan. The street traded more than 200 pieces of various cloths. Hong Kong merchants purchased about 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and colored cloth. Zhejiang road, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taiwan merchants purchased nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Singapore overseas purchased several thousand pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth.</p>
<p>The actual sales of Dongbu are deserted, people's hearts are timid, and the downward trend is fierce. The lowest price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth has dropped to 45 yuan and 8 jiao. It is said that due to the news of foreign exchange recovery, the market atmosphere expanded slightly. The Dragon Head closing price was 47 yuan and 2 jiao, but it was 3 yuan lower than the market price the previous day. Zhonglian brand fine cloth, and no one asked about it, plunging by 3 yuan and a half to 4 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Black Charcoal Interlining Searched Empty</h3>
<p>Black charcoal interlining, the market was quite short of supply yesterday. According to the general factory households, most of the raw materials are expensive, and the cost is contrary to the market price, and they have all stopped weaving, and there are no products. Therefore, the single inventory of old goods is not enough to meet the demand, and it has gradually been searched empty. Full wool sells for 5 yuan and 5 jiao per yard, yarn wool number one sells for 4 yuan and 2 jiao half, number two sells for 3 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao, and there are still few bulk buyers. Only Yuanchang, Huayang, and Dechang have a few sporadic products in the market. It is heard that the raw material wool for weaving black charcoal interlining, there are very few spot goods in foreign companies, and each pound must sell for 15 or 16 yuan. One pound of wool and cotton yarn can weave up to four and a half yards. Therefore, plus all the labor costs, the new black charcoal interlining, number two goods must cost more than four yuan per yard, and it is still a loss of three or four jiao compared to the current market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Domestic Sugar Sees New High Price</h3>
<p>Coarse white, initially weak and then firm in the morning, and then softened again in the afternoon.

Second-grade Gongfen sugar, more than ten bags, also sold at 87 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea, Raw Silk Plunges</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of silk suddenly turned down, with spot goods falling by 80 yuan, and forward goods falling by 48 yuan. New York's near-term was 1 jiao 2 fen lower than Saturday's, and the forward was 1 jiao 1 fen lower. Due to the fact that the cost of the spring cocoons this year is expensive and it is difficult to collect cocoons, and the weather has been bad, silk merchants are afraid to rashly throw their goods, and they are unwilling to sell their goods for cheap. There was no transaction in the market yesterday, and white silk was priced at 6200 yuan, but foreign merchants could not accept it, it was said.</p>
<p>Tianjin sent seven pieces of rayon and two hundred boxes of wool.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Spring Silkworms Are Good</h3>
<p>- Daily Control Cocoon Row</p>
<p>The silkworms in the four villages of Wuxi have been developing quite rapidly in recent days. The large batches are now spinning. The early batches are opening leaves on the third sleep, but the output of mulberry leaves is insufficient, and the price is soaring. The price of each city street in the southeast road villages has been shouting as high as 12 to 13 yuan, and the price in the west road such as Wulihu area has been shouting as high as 15 yuan. Cocoon row is preparing, and the bulk is controlled by the Japanese side. All rows of cocoons to be collected must be registered.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Dried Longan Short</h3>
<p>Dried longan, recently with no arrival, the inventory has become thin, the goods have long been opened and the stock is only sporadic and small, so the market price has turned from weak to strong, and there is hope of a rebound, but old goods are not strange, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Rebar Soars Hundreds of Yuan</h3>
<p>The hardware market was still stable yesterday, as the foreign exchange had stabilized and people's hearts were at ease. However, the prices of various hardware products were still firm, which was due to the increasing expansion of the European war and the unfavorable situation in the Pacific Ocean. The source was tight, and the inventory in Shanghai was limited. However, the sales channels of the various merchants and factories remained the same, so the day when it would be difficult to stop in the future must be inevitable. Those holding goods are even more reluctant to sell, and the rebar is especially noteworthy. The only way to sell the goods is to the street construction gang, and there are few customers from other ports. It is noted that the goods were still sold for 1,000 yuan before May 1st (before the drastic changes in the foreign exchange this time), and the sales were very sluggish. Unexpectedly, after the foreign exchange plummeted this time, the intention to enter from all sides was strong, and the inventory was thin, and the market skyrocketed for a while, with the daily difference of hundreds of yuan. As of yesterday, the asking price per 1,000 catties has reached more than 1,500 yuan (three-point-four-point goods), and the selling price of five-point-to-coarse patterns per 1,000 catties has also soared to more than 1,450 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Pan Yuan Soars</h3>
<p>The recent expansion of the European war has led to difficulties in transportation, which may lead to the shortage of new Pan Yuan goods, and the supply has been cut off, which has led to a sudden change in the market situation of foreign nails and soaring prices, and the standards of the goods have also been rising straight. The current market price per dan is 70 yuan, an increase of five or six yuan compared to the previous price. It is heard that about 100 dan were traded on the market yesterday, so the market is still not deserted.</p>

<h3>Lin Yutang Elaborates in the Philippines: China Holds the Advantage in the War of Resistance Against Japan; Japan's Strength is Hollow, Supply is Cut Off, Accurate Analysis Proves China's Inevitable Victory</h3>
<p>The internationally renowned writer Mr. Lin, after residing in the United States for four years, has recently returned to China specifically to welcome the final victory of China. While passing through Manila, he made a speech, expressing infinite optimism about China's victory. It is now heard that Mr. Lin has given another public lecture in Manila, for which all attendees must purchase tickets, with all proceeds from ticket sales being allocated to the China Industrial Cooperatives.</p>
<p>Former Arrogance, Subsequent Humility, Helpless and Without a Plan</p>
<p>His speech stated that one can view the current Sino-Japanese War as a new Buick car speeding across a vast wilderness. Japan is the car, and China is the boundless wilderness. At present, it is difficult for us to predict whether the car can drive straight ahead or be damaged midway. However, what deserves attention is that the person driving the car has no goal. His fatal injury is the lack of gasoline in the car, relying entirely on the continuous supply from gas stations. However, all gas stations are operated by the United States. After the driver obtains gasoline, the reward given to the operator is constant insults, which makes the gas station owner angry and cut off the supply. Therefore, the driver, formerly arrogant and subsequently humble, is helpless and without a plan.</p>
<p>Favorable Situation is Exciting</p>
<p>He also said, "When I left the United States, newspapers there reported that Japan was quite optimistic about peace, but optimism about peace is also pessimism about war. China's attitude is the opposite. Japan has become weak and unable to launch battles like the Battle of Wuhan. Therefore, it is impossible for Japan to penetrate further into the interior. The reason why it cannot build well in the occupied areas is the same, in a word, its strength is hollow. The occupation of some land in China by Japan is only beneficial to Japan for the convenience of passing through when withdrawing troops." Mr. Lin also expressed great excitement about the current favorable situation in the war of resistance. After returning to China, Mr. Lin will take his family to live in Chongqing. It is heard that Mr. Lin also made his poetic remarks in Manila, saying, "I have always loved to admire the sunset, and I love it even more now. Every time I watch the sunset, I always think to myself, the sun has set, and the Japanese have spent another five million in wealth on the Chinese coast. I firmly believe that China's future is boundless and there is nothing to worry about, so people from all over the world do not need to worry about China."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council is Considering a Salary Increase</h3>

<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily Mail," a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning (the 14th) that the salaries of the Council's staff may be increased, and the exchange rate adjustment for Class A employees based on the exchange rate of one shilling and six pence will also be improved. However, details have not yet been announced. The Council's Personnel Committee, which is considering increasing salaries to cope with rising living costs, will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide on this issue and submit it to the next meeting of the Council's board for approval. The Director of the Public Works Department has submitted "certain proposals" to the Council's Public Works Committee.

<p>It is heard that the nature of the Public Works Department Director's proposals is to seek to improve various problems in the Public Works Department, but the details were not known this morning. When reporters asked the Shanghai Municipal Council spokesman whether the Public Works Department Director's proposals were related to the Council's current austerity plan to lay off five employees of the Public Works Department, the spokesman replied that he had not heard of such news. According to recent reports, five employees of the Public Works Department received layoff notices last week, but the names of these five people could not be ascertained.</p>
<h3>The Gold Treasury Bond Lottery is Still Entrusted to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger</h3>
<p>Future Payment Matters Will Also be Handled by This Bank</p>
<p>Since Germany's invasion of Belgium, people generally associated with the Shanghai branch of Banque Belge pour l'Étranger have feared the impact of the war and have rushed to withdraw deposits. Fortunately, the bank is well-prepared and sufficient to cope with the surplus. It is also heard that the bank is scheduled to hold the lottery and payment matters for the 1928 Six Li Gold Treasury Bonds on June 3rd at 3:00 PM on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>After the Great Victory in Hubei and Henan, Uniform Bonds Surge, Foreign Exchange Loosens, Gold Price Decline Intensifies, Peace Rumors Proven False</h3>
<p>Since yesterday, Shanghai's gold and financial markets have been experiencing turbulence due to reports of the war in Hubei and Henan, coupled with unsubstantiated rumors of peace talks. The black market for foreign exchange suddenly loosened, and the black market for gold and foreign stocks all plummeted. The value of legal tender on Shanghai's black market has risen, and the trading of national bonds on the stock market has been brisk, with prices soaring. The downward trend in raw cotton yarn is still intensifying, and speculators are once again actively engaged. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Frequent Victory Reports, National Bonds Soar: After the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange ordered a suspension of trading due to the war, trading in domestic public bonds has also been done on the black market. Last year, due to the increase in hot money in the Shanghai market, this black market trading became increasingly active. Today, because the government's commitment to maintaining credit remains unchanged, and with frequent reports of victory in the Hubei and Henan war, trading in black market public bonds has been brisk, and prices have soared. The closing prices for various Unified Bonds this afternoon are as follows: Class A closed at 59.55 yuan in the morning and 60 yuan in the afternoon; Class B closed at 51.10 yuan in the morning and 51.85 yuan in the afternoon; Class C closed at 48.95 yuan in the morning and 49.70 yuan in the afternoon; Class D closed at 48 yuan in the morning and 49.70 yuan in the afternoon; Class E closed at 49.90 yuan in the morning and 50.65 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens Sharply, Gold Plunges: Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a British bank, listed the British pound exchange rate as unchanged, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate was reduced by 1.25. The actual trading exchange rate suddenly loosened due to Chinese and Western merchants competing to hoard foreign exchange. At the same time, the black market for gold was rumored to be at peace, so the downward trend intensified. The morning closing price was 6,660 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 6,570 yuan, a significant drop of 325 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign stocks fell sharply yesterday, and the downward trend in raw cotton yarn intensified. The exchange rate premium fell to 110 yuan.</p>
<p>Market Rumors Proven Unfounded: Reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from financial circles yesterday that rumors in the Shanghai foreign exchange market, such as someone flying to Hanoi to negotiate peace, have been proven unfounded. Speculators are deliberately spreading rumors to make profits during frequent reports of victory. In short, today's market in Shanghai is manipulated by speculators, which is completely different from the past. Today, seven out of ten transactions in the market are made by speculative experts. These people aim to make profits and are deeply afraid that rumors will subside and the market will stabilize, making it impossible to monopolize, so they create rumors at any time, and legitimate merchants suffer.</p>
<h3>Dutch Ships Resume Sailing: Java Ships Have Already Set Sail, But Limited to Within the British Naval Sphere of Influence; Routes to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian Ports Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Since the European war affected the Netherlands, Dutch merchant ships sailing on European and Far Eastern routes were ordered to stop sailing. Dutch ships in the Far East were concentrated in Hong Kong and various British-controlled areas in Southeast Asia to await orders. According to reports from Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, after Dutch ships were ordered to temporarily suspend sailing, the Dutch government and British authorities discussed how to handle the situation. It is now learned that a decision has been made on the content of the plan, but details are unavailable. However, it is generally the same as the Norwegian merchant ship sailing plan, which is not to sail outside the British naval sphere of influence. Therefore, the original Dutch ships sailing in the Far East, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia will continue to operate on their original routes. It is now known that the Far Eastern Dutch ships exclusively managed by the Java Mail Steamship Company have been ordered to resume operating routes and temporarily not change. It is also known that the "Chisadan" ship, which had returned from Xiamen to Hong Kong to await orders, departed from Hong Kong on the 13th and will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th. The "Chine Cana" ship, which was waiting for orders in Little Luzon, also left Little Luzon the day before yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. In addition, the Royal Dutch Steamboat Company "Staghn" ship, which arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 16th. The new postal ship "Chi Zhalianjia" sailed from Shanghai back to Java, and was ordered to temporarily stop sailing at Little Luzon, and has now left the Philippines to return to Java.</p>
<h3>After the European Situation Becomes Tense, Mail Delivery Between Europe and Shanghai Continues as Usual</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European war, ships from various countries have been ordered to stop sailing, resulting in reduced flights and transportation difficulties. In order to understand the status of overseas mail delivery, Xin Sheng News Agency reporters yesterday specifically visited the person in charge of the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration to inquire about the current methods of European mail delivery. The answer was as follows: The Postal Administration makes every effort to dredge and quickly deliver mail, both domestic and foreign, despite the extreme difficulties. Especially during the war, people in Shanghai all inquire about the situation at home by letter, so the Bureau will never interrupt the service within its possibilities to comfort the public. Regarding the current delivery of European mail, it is still transferred through the Pacific and Suez routes. Although the number of ship flights has been reduced, the delivery time may not be affected. Russia and Europe via Central and Western Siberia are now scheduled to be sent by train to Nanjing and Tianjin every Tuesday and Friday for transfer. The next mail to Europe will be sealed and sent on May 14th, May 19th via the Pacific, and June 3rd via Suez. The next parcel to the United States will be sealed and sent on May 14th. A large number of mails will arrive from Australia on the 15th at 8:00 AM, and the Bureau has prepared to distribute them to the recipients.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Appoints New Staff</h3>
<p>Regarding personnel matters of the French Concession Municipal Council, several new appointments have recently been issued: Mo Ruofu is appointed as temporary tax collector, Burke Miller and Zha Haosiqi are appointed as temporary inspectors of the Health Department, Dale Maode is appointed as electrical engineer, and Su Gaolefu is appointed as temporary road inspector.</p>
<h3>Dutch Bank Ordered to Stop Paying German Deposits; Chinese and Other Nationals Can Still Withdraw; Similar Measures Taken by Dutch Banks in Japan</h3>
<p>After news of the German invasion of the Netherlands reached Shanghai, there was a run on deposits at the Shanghai branches of Hollandsche Bank-Unie and Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij. After the two banks were able to cope with the withdrawals with sufficient cash, the run gradually subsided. As for the deposits of German merchants, since no instructions had been received from the head office, payments were initially made as usual, and large amounts of funds were withdrawn successively. According to information from foreign banking circles learned by a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday, the above two Shanghai branches received instructions from the head office the night before last that the deposits of Germans should be suspended from withdrawal from today. At the same time, the Dutch banks in Japan have also received similar instructions. The total amount of deposits of German merchants in Dutch banks there is 1.6 million yuan. Since receiving the order, payments have also been refused. As for the German people in Shanghai, since the formation of the Second European War situation on September 2 last year, all deposits that had been deposited in British and French banks have been successively withdrawn and transferred to various banks in the Netherlands and Belgium. Therefore, it is estimated that the amount is quite large. However, the deposits of Chinese and other nationals are still allowed to be withdrawn by the two banks and are not subject to any restrictions. In addition, the Shanghai branch of Banque Belge pour l'Étranger has not yet received any instructions from the head office, so the deposits of Germans are still being paid as usual.</p>
<h3>The Charity Bazaar Opened Yesterday for Refugee Education; Newsreels Were Filmed During the Opening Ceremony, Ticket Revenue Has Reached 80,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The charity bazaar organized by the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute to raise funds for expanding education opened at the Xin Xin Stage on Niuzhuang Road at 12:30 PM yesterday. Despite the torrential rain, the guests were still extremely crowded. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Guests Attending: Yesterday at 12:30 PM, people from all walks of life went to participate one after another, and the enthusiasm was not reduced by the rain. The attendees included: Chairman of the Institute Yuan Ludeng, Directors Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Wei Jinshan, Pu Qiting, Director Lu Wenshao, and all faculty and staff and guests Pan Hongding, Yu Jingqing, Yan Youxiang, Wang Shirong, Ma Wenlin, Cheng Zhiliang, Zhang Qulin, Wu Chengda, Bao Dingbang, etc., film stars Zhang Qihong, Li Lihua, Diao Banhua, Ziwei, Ning Xuan, etc., more than 2,000 people. Yuan Ludeng unveiled the ceremony and Zhang Qihong and others cut the ribbon. Yihua Film Company also filmed more than 200 feet of newsreels during the unveiling. This type of newsreel production is the first time since the Shanghai War.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: The conference was chaired by Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lu Wenshao, Wei Jinshan, and Lin Kanghou. The master of ceremonies was Pan Hongding. In the majestic music of the Institute's band, the curtain was slowly opened. After performing the ceremony, Chairman of the Institute Yuan Ludeng delivered an opening speech, saying: "Today, the Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute is holding a charity bazaar at the Xin Xin Stage to raise funds for expanding education. Although the weather is not good and it is raining heavily, people from all walks of life are still enthusiastically coming to participate in the rain. This is not only something I am extremely grateful for, but all the staff of the Institute and more than 550 children should also bow their heads and thank you. As the saying goes, 'Doing good is the greatest joy.' Only children are the masters of the future. Moreover, in this period of resistance and construction, we should do our best for the future of the country, cultivate talents, and store them for national use. The significance of this is even more than simple charity and compassion. I would like to sincerely wish everyone present infinite longevity." Then the performance of the charity bazaar began.</p>
<p>Summary of Performances: All the famous charities in Shanghai that participated in this conference were collected without omission. Yesterday and today are the grand meeting of famous female Yue opera actors in Shanghai. Starting tomorrow, in addition to dramas and magic charities, Spanish bullfights and national chess masters' charity competitions will also be held. Bullfighting performances are a novel program that people in Shanghai cannot easily see, and will surely cause a sensation in Shanghai. It is also not easy to collect national chess masters in one hall to compete with each other. Many people in Shanghai like this, but there is no opportunity to observe. Now that it can gather its great achievements and appreciate the art of various masters, it is also a grand event in the midst of disaster relief. All sectors of Shanghai society greatly admire the Institute's motivation for raising funds for children's education this time, so they are happy to undertake the sale of theatre tickets. It is heard that as of yesterday, the ticket revenue has reached 80,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>New Telephone Line Equipment Arrives in Shanghai; Installation Still Takes Time; Registered Users Will Be Installed Before the End of the Year; Chinese Employees of the Head Office Will Receive Salary Increases; Increase in Telephone Fees Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>Due to the abnormal development of industry and commerce and the rampant speculation, the installation of telephones in this city has experienced a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply. It is learned that there are more than 6,000 registered users who registered with the company months ago, but have not yet been installed. According to information obtained by a Pingming News Agency reporter from the company yesterday, the reason why telephones have not been installed is not because of a lack of telephone sets, but because the original equipment, with 7,100 automatic telephone lines and 1,000 ordinary telephone lines, has been</p>
<p>completely exhausted, so it is impossible to add more. For this reason, the company has ordered new equipment from the United States. The new equipment has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, but the installation procedures are quite time-consuming, so the users who have registered but have not yet been installed cannot be installed immediately, but at the latest by the end of this year, they can be installed. There are currently 2,500 telephone numbers starting with "6". Whether to increase them in the future depends on the number of needs. Because the automatic lines are insufficient, telephone numbers from "62" and below must be transferred by the company, so users feel quite inconvenient. This inconvenience can be eliminated after the new equipment is installed. The reporter then asked about the rumors that the company will increase telephone</p>
<p>fees. The company replied that this matter is true, but it has not yet reached the stage of decision. According to reports, the company's business is very prosperous, and last year's profit reached a huge 2,861,748 yuan. It is also reported that the company, in view of the soaring prices and the sharp increase in the cost of living, has been approved by the New York head office last month to increase the salaries of all Chinese employees of the Shanghai company by 30% and add a rice subsidy of 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Grand Musical Event of Chinese and Western Ensembles</h3>
<p>For the Orphanage and Widows</p>
<p>Singing professor Lei Cuike B. Resekh requested Settelment, at 9:00 the night before last, the first performance was at the American Women's Association, the performers include Miss Myna Sai, Miss Xue Ying, Mrs. Jiang, Miss Lai Banna, Miss Flumen, and Miss Hu Qiyuan (i.e. Lianlian).</p>
<p>Solo Recital Songs All Famous Songs: That night, Chinese and Western listeners gathered to listen to the beautiful music. There were solo recitals, ensemble singing before, and six special songs requested by the temporary audience. Among them, the moonlight piece by the famous musician Xu Men, Lei Cuike sang as if he was in the scene, thought-provoking, worthy of the artist's work of a great professor. It is a pity that Professor Lei did not sing the original vernacular of the song, but sang the translation, which is a pity, because the original meaning is inevitably lost once translated. However, the voice and tone are the soul of singing. Fortunately, Professor Lei can fully express the essence of music, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Hu Qiyuan Sings Italian Songs: Miss Hu Qiyuan sang a section of UnBeldi in Italian (i.e., one of the Butterfly Madam scripts), and then sang AveMarin in Latin, with clear pronunciation and very pleasant to the ear, making people fascinated. After years of hard training in the ancient Italian method, she was able to achieve this. Miss Hu's performance on stage is dignified and elegant, not only has musical intelligence, but also has natural beauty, both of which are rare. She can represent the characteristics of the Chinese nation's systematic characteristics. The reporter hopes that she will one day go abroad and promote the inherent culture of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Xue Jiangqing's Singing is Thought-Provoking: Xue Ying's singing, if further trained, will definitely be a promising material in the future. The sound is elegant, like the morning bird's language with crystal dew. The school is very similar to Mrs. Fia Lai, a famous singer for many years. Mrs. Jiang's voice, the beauty lies in the flexibility of adding a little bit, listening to it is thought-provoking. Although she has a slight cold, she can cope with it easily.</p>
<p>Bell Song is Rare and Valuable: The point of Miss Flumen's singing is that the work on the transfer of sound is indelible. She is young and has little experience, but for the bell song, the lyrics are long and the tune is high, and she can end the play, which is also rare and valuable. Mr. Lu Weide from Austria accompanied the entire program that night, never slackening, which shows his profound piano art.</p>
<p>Song, Flowers, and Shadows: Happy and Forgetful: The selection of the entire program that night was very precise. It was nearly midnight at the end of the show. The audience listened quietly and happily, and they were tireless. The splendor can be known. Moreover, the stage was full of fresh flowers, dazzling and beautiful. Later, the performers only saw Hibiscus's face, reflected in the flowers, and the clear songs were melodious, and came from the flowers. Beautiful women and famous flowers, reflecting each other's beauty, are like a wonderful painting of butterflies in love with flowers.</p>

<h3>Night Soil Collectors and Road Workers Strike, Authorities Seek Resolution, Road Workers Propose Five Conditions, Citizens Hope for Early End to Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Since night soil carters, street cleaners, and road workers demanded wage increases and went on strike, a noteworthy situation has developed in the past two days. Garbage cans in various alleys are full to overflowing, blocking the roads. Residents dump excrement everywhere, and after pouring it into the inner ditches, it repeatedly emerges on the ground, causing a stench that makes people cover their noses. Due to the street cleaners' strike, the city's appearance has been damaged, especially at tram and bus stops, where fruit peels and discarded tickets are scattered all over the ground, trampled by people, presenting a very messy and dirty scene.</p>
<p>Excrement and filth cover the ground, and a stench fills the air. Yesterday morning, near Xinzha Road and Chengzhe Road, a destroyed night soil cart was left by the roadside, and yellow and white objects were scattered everywhere, possibly destroyed by striking workers. Residents within the concession, mostly living in small rooms, cannot accumulate excrement and garbage for even a day, and all hope that the labor unrest can be resolved as soon as possible. The English-language North China Daily News reported that the night soil carters in the Public Concession, demanding wage increases, began a strike. This morning (the 14th) at 8:00 AM, several night soil carters dumped the night soil from their carts onto the road at the intersection of Beijing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. It is reported that similar disturbances have occurred in other parts of the Public Concession. The Fire Brigade was called to the intersection of Beijing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road to wash away the night soil. Several night soil carters attempted to stop them, but retreated when the police arrived on the scene. In addition, the striking street cleaners have not yet made direct demands to the Public Works Department. However, according to an official from the Public Works Department this morning, the authorities will meet with representatives of the strikers today or tomorrow in order to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Road Workers' Five Conditions After road workers in the Public Concession went on strike due to demands for wage increases and rice subsidies, yesterday morning, they sent representatives to petition public organizations such as the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the First Special District Citizens' Federation, requesting assistance. In addition to stating that they were forced to ask the Municipal Council to improve their treatment due to prices and the difficulty of making a living, the representatives submitted five conditions, requesting that they be conveyed to the Municipal Council for adoption. The five conditions are recorded as follows: (1) For wages, request an increase of 30% on the existing wages; (2) For rice subsidies, take a rice price of 20 yuan as the standard, and the Municipal Council should subsidize the excess (with each person supplying two non-working family members as the standard, requiring three liters of rice per day); otherwise, please the Municipal Council sell at a flat price of 20 yuan per dan; (3) During holidays, if work is required, please pay wages at double the rate; (4) Wages should also be paid during weekdays when there is no work; (5) Raincoats must be provided for working in the rain, and if work is stopped due to rain, wages should still be paid.</p>
<p>Demands of Night Soil Cart Workers The minimum wage for night soil cart workers is only four yuan, with most earning nine yuan per month. The workers are now requesting the contractors to whom they are subcontracted: (1) A monthly rice subsidy of ten yuan, which will not be paid if the rice price falls to twenty yuan; (2) The small account for each cart is currently six fen, please add two fen to make it eight fen in total; (3) It is customary for each store and household to receive a subsidy of two jiao per commode, now please increase it to three jiao. For the above three items, the workers request the contractors to apply to the Municipal Council for approval.</p>

<h3>Mother and Daughter Tragically Strangled, Perpetrator Flees Without a Trace, Victims Dressed as Villagers, Two Men Accompanied Them to a Private Room in a Hotel, Why They Were Killed is Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>In Room 29, No. 5, Lane 606, Fuzhou Road, a tragic case of a mother and daughter being suddenly strangled to death occurred on the ninth of the month. The two murderers fled without a trace after the incident. The general situation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, details of the situation are explored and recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Private Room in a Hotel Runhua Hotel is located at No. 5, Lane 606, Xiaohuajiao, Zhejiang Road, Fuzhou Road, and has been open for many years. Most of the guests come from other ports. The other day (the 13th) around 4:00 PM, two men and one woman arrived, the woman carrying a girl about two or three years old. The waiter led them to Room 29 on the second floor, paid three yuan for the room, and registered as Wang Zhongli, from Qidong, 36 years old, a cloth merchant. After the waiter brought tea and firewood, the door was immediately closed, and there was no sound.</p>
<p>Tragically Murdered It was not until around 8:00 PM that the two men went out together. Around 9:00 PM, the waiter went to the room to get slippers and found the mother and daughter both tragically strangled under the bed. Their bodies were cold, and they were dead. He immediately reported the situation to the Laoza Gate Police Station, which ordered four detectives to investigate and take photos. An inspection of the clothes and bags left in the room revealed only the girl's diapers and a few small clothes. The mother's neck still had a woman's belt around it, and the child's head and neck had a hemp rope around them. The corpses were still lying on their mothers. After careful inspection, it was clear that the mother and daughter had been strangled to death, and the bamboo mat was placed upright on the bed. It was undoubtedly the two men who had murdered them. The police are currently conducting a strict search for the two fugitives.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Case When the reporter heard the news, he rushed to investigate. According to the hotel accountant, the people in this case were all dressed as villagers. One man was wearing a coffee-colored long gown, and the other man was wearing a light gray short jacket, both around thirty years old. The murdered woman was wearing a black short coat, new black cloth shoes, and a striped cloth shirt and pants. She was also about twenty years old. The dead child was wearing a floral striped short jacket and pants, and a red cloth vest. It was later discovered that the mouths of the two dead were stuffed with straw paper, so the adjacent rooms on the left and right did not hear any noise when the murder occurred. The reason why the two men committed this heinous act is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Illegal Milk Stall Fined</h3>
<p>Hui Min Ranch was fined for producing cream without sterilization and transporting milk in an unlicensed location. The Milk Company was also fined for producing adulterated milk. After investigation by the Municipal Council, the court sentenced them on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>New Gambling Dens in Zhabei Exploit the Blood and Sweat of the Common People</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post, the number of gambling dens in the Western District has decreased, but two new gambling dens have recently opened near the vegetable market on Dongqiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road. One is the Daf Fa Entertainment Center on Qiujiang Road, which opened on the 3rd of this month, and the other is the Sheng Xing Company, also on Qiujiang Road, which opened on the 5th of this month. In addition, a gambling den is also being prepared in a certain alley on Qiujiang Road, reportedly run by the Japanese. These three gambling dens are poorly equipped, with capital of only three or four thousand yuan each, and are designed to lure poor gamblers.</p>
<h3>Case of Kidnapping Chen Wenzhao, One Bandit Arrested, According to Confession, Two Accomplices Released by Puppet Police</h3>
<p>Chen Wenzhao, who lives at No. 16, Lane 335, Yanping Road, is a contractor with some savings. On the 27th of last month at 11:30 PM, more than ten bandits, each armed with pistols and Mauser pistols, broke into his house and robbed him of 100 yuan in cash, as well as gold rings and coats. At the same time, they handcuffed Chen, kidnapped him. At this time, a certain Jia, the lane manager, learned that Chen's house had been robbed and reported it to the Chinese police and puppet police stationed nearby. At the time, the puppet police officer Xie immediately rushed to the outside of Chen's house.</p>
<p>They fired three shots in warning, and the bandits fired back three shots. Then they took Chen and fled. By the time the police arrived, the bandits had already fled without a trace. The detectives found a ladder, three Mauser pistol shell casings, and a pair of shoes left by the bandits in the victim's house. Chen was released by the bandits the next day after being kidnapped, but he suffered minor injuries from falling when he was suddenly taken away by the bandits. It was not until the other day that Xu Decheng, Tao Aifu, and Wu De Kui, detectives from the Route Tenant de Tourville Police Station, arrested</p>
<p>Yu Zhijiang, a bandit from Yangzhou, was brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the lawyer of the police station, Jiang Baolian, explained the process, and said that according to the defendant's confession, they had planned to kidnap Chen and demand a ransom of 50,000 yuan when they went to Chen's house at the time. However, after kidnapping him, they released Chen because the situation was urgent. The cotton-padded coat that the defendant had robbed had already been recovered by the detectives. It was also found that the Zhabei "Police Station" had arrested two suspects after the incident. When the police station went to inquire, the "Station" claimed that the two had nothing to do with the case and had released them that night. But now,</p>
<p>According to Yu's confession, the two people arrested by the "Police Station" at the time were accomplices who went with him, and they were all carrying weapons. The case still needs to be investigated, so he requested that the hearing be postponed. After Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned Chen Wenzhao and Yu Zhijiang, he ordered Yu to be returned to custody and the hearing postponed.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Shot and Killed by Thieves</h3>
<p>Qiu Changchun, a Shandong native, 53 years old, was a gatekeeper at No. 2, Lane 355, near the intersection of Connaught Road and Avenue Haig. At around 9:30 PM last night, several thieves attempted to enter the house to rob it. At the time, the gatekeeper, seeing that the people who came were suspicious, questioned them. Unexpectedly, they took the initiative to grab the gatekeeper around the waist and snatch the official pistol he was carrying. The gatekeeper fought back regardless of his own safety, and shouted for help. However, he was outnumbered, and the gun eventually fell into the hands of the thieves. Seeing that the gatekeeper was still shouting, they opened fire. The gatekeeper fell to the ground, and the thieves scattered and fled with the gun. By the time the people in the house heard the noise and came out to see what had happened, the gatekeeper was already dying. They quickly reported it to the police station, which sent the gatekeeper to the hospital. However, because the injury was to a vital area, he died shortly after. The police are currently searching for the gang of thieves and tracking down the whereabouts of the gun.</p>
<h3>Thieves Arrested for Resisting Arrest</h3>
<p>Near the intersection of Route Paul Henry and Route Tokyo in western Shanghai, several thieves were plotting something at around 9:00 PM last night. A patrol of Chinese police officers passed by and tried to search them. Unexpectedly, the thieves opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese police officers fought back, resulting in the capture of one thief and the seizure of a pistol. The remaining thieves escaped. The captured thief and the weapon were taken to the police station. It is reported that the thief is named Wang Xiaosanzi, from Jiangbei, 22 years old. He was shot in the chest and legs by the Chinese police officers and fell to the ground.</p>
<h3>The Dade Steamer, Fully Loaded with Cotton, Had a Huge Sum of Money Hidden Inside and Was Robbed. A Seaman Was Arrested and Confessed to Dozens of Accomplices. Negotiations Were Proposed After the Dade Steamer Was Burned.</h3>
<p>The Dade Steamer (flying the Japanese flag) previously loaded more than 100 pieces of cotton and more than 20 pieces of yellow wolf skins in northern Jiangsu and came to Shanghai. It was docked at the Xinhuishan Wharf for transshipment and unloading. It was rumored that more than 200,000 yuan in silver dollars was hidden in the cotton. Later, it was discovered by Little Xu, a cotton merchant king from Changzhou in the Hongkou North Gang, and Zhang Miaolin and Wang Changsheng, who worked as longshoreman. They colluded to set the steamer on fire to rob it. Later,</p>
<p>Due to the uneven distribution of the loot, infighting broke out and it was exposed. A thug impersonated a detective and blackmailed them for 1,700 yuan. At the same time, the Customs and Jiangkou Police Station on Avenue Edward VII learned about it and sent Detective Gu Wenkui to investigate. It is now known that the details of this case are extremely complicated, and there have been recent developments. The seaman Little Mao Lang has been arrested. He confessed to more than 50 accomplices. Later, several seamen, including Little Mazi, Lansheng, and Atu, were also arrested. They also confessed that Jin Mei represented Wang Changsheng in resolving the blackmail matter, and Wang Changsheng's</p>
<p>lighter was impounded and a small amount of stolen goods were recovered. It is reported that there were two leather suitcases, containing some gold bars, which have been moved ashore. Later, an informant, Little Mao Gou, reported that Wang Changsheng's two sons, Quan Shoufu and Shouquan, were hiding in the Dahua Hotel on Baliliqiao Street, so the police first arrested the Wang Shouquan and Shoufu brothers. Zhang Miaolin set up a tea party at No. 36 Yong'an Street (the former Senhe Tea House, which is now closed). Others also set up a lighter company upstairs, specializing in transporting goods for customers. He went to arrest him, but Zhang Miaolin had already</p>
<p>escaped after hearing the news. As for the 26 lighters, small steamers were used to tow them to Bailianjing, Zhoujiadu, Liuliqiao and other places to escape. The lighters had no shareholder relationship with Zhang Miaolin, and were probably hired by Zhang to transport goods. It is reported that the cotton and yellow wolf skins were declared and transported by Zhonghe Customs Broker on behalf of the customer. After the Dade Steamer was burned, it could no longer operate. Negotiations have also been proposed, requesting compensation. The fugitives are currently being strictly arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>The Kidnapping of Elementary School Student Li Zhaolin</h3>
<p>The kidnapping of Ningbo student Li Zhaolin at 4:30 PM the other day has been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the French-language newspaper in this port, the details of the case are disclosed in detail as follows: At 6:05 PM the other night, a foreigner living on Route Amiral Courbet called the Jing'an Temple Police Station and said that across from his residence, he had found a silver car parked for more than half an hour. There was no one in the car, and he feared that the car was being used in a certain case. After receiving the news, the police station immediately sent detectives to the scene. Inside this car, a schoolbag was found, with books tied with leather straps, and there was a seal of a certain elementary school on Route Amiral Courbet. The detectives then went to the school to inquire and learned that the books belonged to Li Zhaolin (11 years old), a student at the school. Li is the son of real estate businessman Li Aian, residing at No. 2, Lane 767, Route Kaufmann. After his parents confirmed that the schoolbag was indeed his son's, they realized that Li had been kidnapped. The car driver also went to the police station to report that at 4:40 PM, he carried four customers and drove to Route Amiral Courbet when he was threatened by guns by these people and driven out of the car. At the time, they also took his cap and put it on by another man and drove away quickly. He was taken by two bandits to a village where he walked around for about an hour, and then released him after 6:00 PM. The police have now obtained clues and found that someone witnessed four bandits forcibly dragging a child towards a small village after 5:00 PM. The child was still struggling and calling for help.</p>
<p>One of the Scenery of Early Summer (Part II)</p>
<h3>The Origin of Soda Fountains</h3>
<p>Durand invented the soda fountain, which became popular from the United States to France, England... Many businessmen have since become wealthy, and tens of thousands of men, women, old and young, have become close friends with this refreshing, invigorating, and fatigue-recovering fountain. In the United States alone, there are as many as 90,000 of these soda shops, of which 30,000 belong to pharmacies and 40,000 belong to candy stores, clubs, ballparks, and subway stations. In addition, 15,000 soda fountains are located in department stores and various shops, and 5,000 are in hotels and restaurants, with total annual sales being considerable.</p>
<p>This Frenchman Durand originally served as a pharmacist in Napoleon's army. In 1817, he was exiled to the United States to seek a living, wandering in New York, Boston, Baltimore, and finally to Philadelphia. There were quite a few French people there, including one of Napoleon's brothers, and this place was also the center of the American pharmaceutical industry, so Durand decided to start a business there.</p>
<p>Before serving in Napoleon's army, Durand studied under Mr. Chevillot, a versatile Frenchman. All botany, mineralogy, medicine, and chemistry were taught by Mr. Chevillot, so Durand also became a versatile person. He opened a pharmacy in Philadelphia, selling beverages, tobacco, and other items. The various sodas he sold were his special drinks.</p>
<p>This new-style shop opened in April 1825, and the soda fountain became the most popular installation, with mahogany, cabinets, magnetic bottles, French medicines, chemicals, mirrors, and a large marble counter. The equipment for making soda water was installed on this large marble counter. The soda fountains in the cold drink shops in Shanghai are not accidentally made of large marble counters. (E.L.)</p>
<h3>Police Solve Petty Thief Gang, Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>Several days ago, detectives from the Laoza Gate Police Station cracked a large-scale pickpocket organization in this city, arresting three men, two girls, and six boys. According to the investigation, the two men rented a room in a hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, specializing in taking in runaway children aged 16 to 18 and teaching them pickpocketing skills. They had two boys pretend to fight in the street, while their accomplices took the opportunity to pickpocket in the crowd. After several months of "training," they were dispatched to the busy areas of Nanjing Road every afternoon from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, dressed as students. They conducted their first trial on the 7th of this month and it was unexpectedly effective, so they had accumulated a large amount of stolen goods in the past few weeks, such as wallets, fountain pens, pencils, etc. Unexpectedly, they were cracked in front of Wing On Department Store. After strict questioning by the police, clues were obtained and the leader of the organization was arrested at the address.</p>
<h3>Construction Industry's Miao Kaikin Detained</h3>
<p>Family Members Trying to Rescue Him</p>
<p>Miao Kaikin, a native of Funing, lives at No. 3283, South Yinghua Lane, Route Paul Henry. Before August 13th, he was engaged in the building materials business. Later, his business was suspended due to the war. His mother and several brothers were killed in a Japanese air raid at their residence on Yangjiazhai Road in Shanghai. Miao was deeply stimulated, and his national consciousness became stronger. During the puppet Reformed Government, the Japanese advisor of the puppet Ministry of Industry, Takahashi, once invited Miao to handle construction matters for the Japanese army. Miao was not tempted and resolutely refused. Unexpectedly, he was resented by a certain party for this reason. At around 8:00 AM on the 7th of this month, he was instructed by a certain Zhou to go to the leasing office at No. 1, Lane 1, North Yinghua Lane, Route Paul Henry, to talk. It was heard that it belonged to the Rihua Spinning Mill. He was detained in the team by a certain gendarmerie stationed at the Rihua Spinning Mill and has not been released yet. Later, his family reported it to the police station, and they are currently trying to rescue him.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Branch to Discuss Tomorrow How to Settle the Remaining Displaced Persons</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch began the second batch of resettlement work, there are currently more than 5,000 refugees under the management of the branch. By the 17th of this month, more than 2,000 people can still be resettled. Although most of the remaining 1,000 refugees are elderly, weak, women and children, there are also some young and strong people. Although the Relief Association has notified all shelters to resettle the young and strong by the end of this month, the industries and others have no place to accommodate them after that, and they have requested to continue to be accommodated. It is reported that since the Dunxin Road Refugee Shelter, which is affiliated to the Relief Association, began resettlement work, the total number of refugees accommodated has decreased from 14,000 to 11,000. The number of refugees in the shelters of the Cilian General Association is still more than 12,000, plus the more than 5,000 refugees in the Cilian Branch, the total number of refugees is less than 20,000. The refugees in the shelters have decreased, but the number of beggars in the streets has obviously increased, which is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Meteorological Observatory in Xujiahui reported at 4:30 PM on the 15th that the weather around Shandong is changeable and uncertain, with directional dust storms.

<h3>Watching a Play Causes Trouble (2)</h3>
<p>The bannermen below the stage were rubbing their fists and palms, thinking in their hearts that the villagers, seeing external support, would definitely urge an attack from within, so that they could break through the encirclement with a combined attack from inside and out. Therefore, several bannermen clamored and advanced, intending to first open the theater door to support the people on stage. The crowd of villagers guarding the door saw the bannermen below the stage rising up together with clenched fists, knowing that they were going to assist those on stage. They couldn't help but bare their arms and shout loudly in response. In an instant, hundreds of villagers, both inside and outside the temple, rushed to gather. Although the villagers had no other weapons, the carrying poles on their shoulders and the tobacco pipes in their hands were swung horizontally and struck downwards with the force of a rainstorm. The bannermen were trapped in the center, outnumbered and unable to defend themselves, let alone rescue others. They all risked their lives to break through the encirclement, scrambling to escape. However, more and more villagers came from near and far, their courage increasing. They then threw open the theater door, and when they saw someone escaping, they attacked him as a group. Therefore, none of the dozen or so people standing on the stage managed to escape. Although none suffered fatal injuries, their clothes were all torn, and they returned covered in blood, suffering from their wounds. It was said that more than a dozen villagers were also injured. During the conflict between the two sides, there were a dozen or so bannermen, neatly dressed, standing under the mulberry trees, watching with their hands in their sleeves, not coming to help. The villagers treated them with the respect due to honored guests and even apologized to them, showing how effective propriety and law can be in subjugating people.</p>

<h3>The Character of a Mother (3)</h3>
<p>A child without a mother has fewer opportunities in life than others, and his life race will be greatly hindered as a result. The success of great figures is often due to their mothers. A child without a mother is pitiful, and a child without a good mother is even more pitiful. Xiang Bo had a disreputable mother, who bore a disreputable son. Once, the son committed a crime and was arrested. When the prosecutor said he wanted to meet with the mother, the prosecutor allowed it. Unexpectedly, during the meeting, he hatefully bit off one of his mother's ears. It is said that his mother had deprived him of his natural rights and proper upbringing. When ancient Greece and Rome had virtuous mothers who trained their children, their countries were strong and dominant for a time. Later, Greece produced a group of playboys, and Rome produced a group of lewd individuals. God then began to erase their glory, causing their countries to be overthrown, just as one wipes away the contents of a plate and then turns the plate upside down. (4) The growth of benevolent white flowers shows the benevolence of the mother. The mother's life is benevolent and progressive. In this family school, not only are there children as students, but the mother herself also learns carefully in all matters. Therefore, her loving heart is expanding day by day. (5) The quality of faithful white flowers shows the mother's faithfulness. The mother's love never diminishes, and her attitude is very faithful. When a child is sick and lingers without recovery, the father may become discouraged due to anxiety, but the mother forgets her fatigue and always hopes forward. The father is impatient with the son's stubbornness and disobedience, or even wants to drive the son out of the house, but the mother is not like that. She never loses heart, and her love binds her children, not letting them wander away. Therefore, human mothers are worthy of our utmost respect. However, a sensible mother is unwilling to take such respect for herself, because all her purity, beauty, love, and faithfulness are only reflections of God's true light. She must give all glory to God. (The End) If you want to study in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227.</p>
<h3>A Sixth-Grader's Diary</h3>
<p>— Xu Bide</p>
<p>The author was introduced by a good friend to teach on probation at a certain free primary school. When grading a sixth-grader's diary, there were several pages like this, and now I have copied them below:</p>
<p>May 2nd: Today, the second landlord called three loafers and unreasonably moved our bed, table, and chairs all into the alley. My dad said, "Please give us a few more days to pay the rent, and move the things back in, okay?" The loafers not only didn't agree but also clenched their fists, looking very fierce, which made my mom speechless and my little sister cry non-stop. Later, thanks to the old uncle next door who interceded, they agreed to wait a few days for payment, and the things were moved back in.</p>
<p>May 3rd: Dad is frowning and worried because I still can't find a job. Dad said to Mom, "I'm thinking of borrowing usurious loans to try being a peddler." Mom said, "You have to donate for a permit first before you can do that."</p>
<p>May 4th: Dad is breathless and his face doesn't look good. He said, "Alas! The thirty yuan I borrowed from the usurious loan today was lost in my pocket, I don't know how." Mom said anxiously, "What's going to happen? The poorer we are, the closer we are to death!"</p>
<p>May 5th: Mom is sick, her body is hot. Dad has empty hands, how can we have money to hire a doctor? Little sister is still crying and asking Dad for fried dough sticks to eat, but Dad has no way.</p>
<p>May 6th: Mom can get up now, probably because the tea medicine was effective yesterday afternoon. I'm really happy, Mom has the strength again to wash clothes for others. Dad said, "Today's usurious loan has to be paid no matter what, and the rent has to be paid too, if we don't pay, they'll do that again." Mom said, "There's nowhere to borrow money, and I can't find work. Now we have no choice but to sell the table and chairs to the used goods stall."</p>
<p>May 8th: Now, in our house, besides some broken things, there is only one bed left.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Juvenile Delinquency</h3>
<p>When a little life cries out upon landing in the world, the parents always have indescribable joy and even hold sky-high hopes, hoping that their child will grow up to be outstanding, make a great career, bring glory to the family, and serve society and the country. But without the parents' painstaking guidance, it is very dangerous. The saying "At the beginning of man, his nature is good, his natures are similar, his habits are different" is an observation of human nature by the ancients. Human nature is inherently good, but the goodness or badness of the environment can lead the child's innocent goodness astray.</p>
<p>Juvenile delinquency has become one of the serious problems in today's society, and it has to be attributed to major defects in children's education.</p>
<p>This problem is more likely to occur in bustling cities and has been developing rapidly in recent years. A few days ago, there was a report on "petty theft gangs" that needs to be institutionalized. And the proactive solution, the only way to start from the bottom is not for merit.</p>
<p>(1) Causes of juvenile delinquency</p>
<p>(1) Poor family environment: (2) Association with despicable friends: (3) Poor children's guardians: (4) Temptation from the outside world.</p>
<p>(2) Types of juvenile delinquency</p>
<p>(1) Theft or robbery: (2) Laziness and truancy: (3) Minor misconduct, disrupting public order.</p>
<p>(3) How to prevent juvenile delinquency</p>
<p>(1) Organize educational children's gatherings; (2) Improve youth groups (reformatories), etc.; (3) Implement better juvenile delinquency laws; (4) Have sufficient parks and sports fields for children to play properly; (5) Guide them with normal entertainment; (6) Implement compulsory education to make children understand their own cleanliness and goodness and get on the right track; (7) Study the causes and provide good guidance.</p>
<p>The above is just a rough outline. I hope that people who are enthusiastic about public welfare will do some good deeds to improve children, seek happiness for society, and create a bright future for the country.</p>
<h3>A Lesson in Hoarding</h3>
<p>— Jian Tian</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, a new "maxim" became popular in the speculative market: all imported goods can be hoarded. So, all kinds of clothing, daily necessities, and even medicines and cosmetics were locked in warehouses and shelved, waiting for exchange rate fluctuations, smoking cigars, and waiting to get rich.</p>
<p>This situation also affected ordinary people. Those with a little money in their hands also copied other people's old tricks and "bought a little bit of goods."</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. So-and-so, for some unknown reason, perhaps it was to play a "dark horse," hoarded a batch of sewing needles. After a few days, it was as if hot chestnuts popped out of cold embers, and the price of foreign needles soared. But it's easy to hoard, hard to sell, and waiting and waiting, they were piled up at home and couldn't be "realized." Up to now, according to market prices, he would certainly have earned money, but even if he put up an advertisement, no one would buy. It seems that he can only keep them for himself and hoard them to the end!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Lakes and Mountains Refreshed, Each With Its Own Beauty; Men and Women Rejoicing, Together Shouting "Long Live"</p>
<p>It is said that when Zhu Airen and others arrived at the toy stall on Huiquan Mountain in Wuxi, they saw a set of three clay figurines of children displayed there, their faces strikingly similar to the triplets in their orphanage. Asking about the reason, they learned that they were also products of Mrs. Xue's toy factory. Originally, this was first started by those toy companies in Europe and America. Ten years ago, the foreign dolls they made included idols of movie child stars Shirley Temple and Joan Carroll. There were also quintuplets from Canada who were also made into toys. This trend has gradually become popular in China. Zhu Airen asked Mrs. Xue, and Mrs. Xue felt very sorry. She said, "I didn't know they were from your orphanage. There is a technician in our factory who said that there is a family of triplets who are very lively and cute. He took a few photos and simulated them from the photos. He said he had even gone to see them himself. I was negligent for a moment and didn't ask where he had seen them. This is still a new product! I'm really sorry. I don't know if he ever sought the consent of the children's parents and guardians. Dr. Zhu, what do you think we should do?" Zhu Airen said, "It's not a big deal. Fortunately, you're not using the children for advertising. This comes from a love of beauty. I'll go back and inform their parents." Shao Huihua had already taken the clay figurine of the child in her hand. The head, face, hands, and feet were exposed, and the rest were wearing colorful clothes that could be changed. Mrs. Xue said, "This is a bit more exquisite. Although it's called a clay figurine, it must be mixed with other oil wax materials to be so beautiful and not easily broken." As she spoke, she discussed with the toy store and gave each of them a set of these clay figurines of the triplets. However, Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyu, a newly married couple, were given one set together. In a moment, the toy company would return them to the toy store, as they were only borrowing them temporarily. At this time, Shao Huihua looked closely at the clay figurines of the triplets and suddenly smiled, "Mrs. Xue! We're sending you materials again today." Mrs. Xue said, "What materials?" Shao Huihua smiled, "Since the technician in your company can sculpt the likenesses of triplets, he can naturally sculpt the likenesses of twins. We have a pair of twins here right now." As she spoke, she pointed to the two Miss He's, "If you can make these two sisters into clay figurines, then I will definitely take two back to worship them." Jin Danyu said, "If you're going to sculpt our likenesses, of course, you should sculpt you first. You said that if you can sculpt triplets, you can sculpt twins. I say that if you can sculpt twins, you can sculpt singletons." (277)</p>
<h3>Under the Heavy Pressure of Life, a Family Meeting</h3>
<p>— Jin Chuan</p>
<p>The heavy pressure of life squeezed the breath out of us, and everyone's face was full of worry, especially my mother, who murmured all day long about the price of briquettes and rice, which made her worried and frustrated. Last night, my father, mother, sister, and I held a family meeting. My mother strongly advocated moving to the occupied area. Her reason was that rent was not required and the cost of living was lower. But my father spoke with great righteousness and finally persuaded my mother. But what should we do living in Shanghai? My sister spoke up and said, "The soaring prices and the inability to live is a global problem, we are not parasites, we are working, but the compensation we get is not commensurate with the cost of living and we are starving to death, this is not our fault, this is a 'man-made disaster', and the culprits who caused the 'man-made disaster' are of course someone else, which doesn't have to be stated clearly, but the accomplices are these hoarders and manipulators. It is ineffective to deal with the manipulation of the hoarders and hope for a little conscience and the government's restrictions, because conscience is a rational thing, and without reason, there is no conscience; and the government's price limits have also failed in the past. Hoarders have many tricks to play, such as the fixed price of rice, but the invoice may be written as Saigon rice, and so on. Now we just need to encourage the staff and coolies who serve the hoarders to take non-cooperation, and reporting method: he wants to hoard, the coolie does not help to transport and stack; he wants to raise prices, the clerk will not work with him, but because of this he is unemployed, all the residents of Shanghai will pay to rescue them." My father said, "Isn't that too idealistic!"</p>
<p>My sister replied, "It's not idealistic at all. In today's isolated island, there is a lack of a leading figure, and the general level of education is also low. During the First World War, I was in London, where all prices were controlled by the government. If you hoarded goods in your home, someone would immediately go to the police station to report it, and the police would immediately come to check and impose a lot of fines, and they were ashamed of hoarding for the war. But in Shanghai, there is no way to implement it, and we have to regret it!"</p>
<p>Everyone nodded, and the family meeting came to a close.</p>

<h3>Film Emperor Miguel Rona's Top Ten Favorite Stars</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>This year's Film Emperor Miguel Rona, at the request of the famous American magazine LOOK, selected his top ten favorite stars, with a few concise reasons, which are now excerpted and translated below:</p>
<p>(1) Clark Gable—He is a genuine heroic figure, with ruthlessness containing emotion, and ruggedness with gentleness. I'm afraid you won't find another person with such a personality in Hollywood.</p>
<p>(2) Judy Garland—When she sings, how pleasant and moving it is. Her bright voice makes me even more excited.</p>
<p>(3) Norma Shearer—Her acting skills are multifaceted. Besides the word "genius," there is no other word to describe her.</p>
<p>(4) Spencer Tracy—His calm and determined style is unmatched.</p>
<p>(5) John Garfield—He is the younger Spencer Tracy.</p>
<p>(6) Henry Fonda—Like me, he is not beautiful, but he has a special power that makes women like him.</p>
<p>(7) Luise Rainer—Her frail body, gentle and docile posture, and melancholy expression have earned me countless tears of sympathy on the screen.</p>
<p>(8) Paul Muni—He plays historical roles realistically. Only she in Hollywood has this ability.</p>
<p>(9) Errol Flynn—His two sword-like eyebrows are a symbol of heroism, and his blue eyes contain perseverance, but what I admire most is his tall physique.</p>
<p>(10) Tyrone Power—I hope to have his sparkling eyes, cute nose, red lips, and snow-white teeth.</p>
<h3>Film Performance and Cigarette Butts</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>In many theaters in England, France, and the United States, smoking is allowed. The owners use the density of smoke to test the performance of the film being shown. If many people are smoking pipes or cigarettes, it means that the audience is not interested in the film. Conversely, if the film is very moving, then there will be fewer smokers.</p>
<p>The length of the cigarette butts thrown on the ground after the show is an even better test. If the film is exciting and moving, there will definitely be many half-smoked butts on the ground. This indicates that the smoking audience just lit up, and their emotions were attracted by the performance on the film, so they threw it away before smoking half of it. If the audience is bored with the film, then there will definitely be countless short cigarette butts thrown away.</p>
<h3>"China Travel" and *The True Story of Ah Q*</h3>
<p>— Ming Ruoshui</p>
<p>Ah Q is the creation of a typical character in literature. From him, the weaknesses of old Chinese society are reproduced. I agree with Ms. Xu Guangping's words: "Ah Q not only represents the weaknesses of Chinese national character, but also represents the weaknesses of half of the world's nations, especially in rural or oppressed nations. This type can be found anytime, anywhere."</p>
<p>Ah Q contains many aspects of a complex character; he is ridiculous, but even more lovable; he is despised, but he is even more worthy of sympathy. It should be said that "The True Story of Ah Q" is a tragedy, not a comedy. In those roars of laughter, there is an infinite amount of poignant human touch.</p>
<p>The adaptation of "The True Story of Ah Q" into a stage play is an arduous task. Chen Yu's script is quite successful. It is said that this script was written specifically for "China Travel." "China Travel" put it on the stage for the first time in Wuhan after the Anti-Japanese War, and directed by Hong Shen, it created an unprecedented success record in the theater world. Now, this national drama is bringing it to the audiences in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The performance of "Ah Q" at this time and place has great significance in terms of theater movement and any other aspect. "The remaining forces of feudalism are still very large, we must continue to fight!..." We should remember the revolutionaries' shouts in the fifth act of the play. Light will sweep away all this corrupting labor! It brings us truth. These have great effects on the current sacred cause.</p>
<p>Last night, the author was very honored to visit the performance of this script and considered it a satisfactory appreciation. This time, Li Jingbo's Ah Q does not seem to be as the original depicts. However, according to what Zhou Zuoren saw of Ah Q in the past, he himself was also relatively fat, although he was poor, he was not haggard, his body was quite strong, his face was slightly round, and he had a very imposing appearance. In this way, Mr. Li is just like that character.</p>
<h3>New Film Techniques</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Guohua's new film "The Romantic Emperor" will begin filming soon. It is said that this film will create a new record in Chinese film photography technology, that is, the female lead Zhou Manhua will play two roles at the same time, and she must appear in the same scene, and she can act lively and unrestrained.</p>

<h3>Zhou Jianyun Talks About the Purpose of "Golden Star"</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Zhou Jianyun, for the newly created Golden Star Film Company, invited reporters yesterday to discuss everything. Zhou said first: "What I am going to tell you today can be said to be the correct report of Golden Star Company, and it can also be said to be a total correction of the company's news in the past." Zhou continued to talk about the purpose of preparing for the company, the process, and the ambitions, etc. "The company began preparations in the summer of last year. The shareholders are Nanyang film merchants and honest merchants in this port. Their purpose is not only for profit, because they all have great interest in the film industry. The works filmed may have sugar coating, but they must contain good medicine, and absolutely cannot be mixed with poison. In terms of the photography field, we have adopted a consumer cooperative system with Guohua. Whether it is technicians or actors (except Zhou Xuan), both parties can allocate and apply. Male and female leads have now been sent to Yu, Dian, Gui, and Hong Kong to ask the stars of the past from the old companies. If they are willing to come, they are all welcome to cooperate, and Bai Yang and Gao Qian are also on the list. In Shanghai, all those who have not signed a basic contract with any company are also planned to be gradually invited. The number of films released each year is ten. Both modern and period films are produced. I think the decline of period films is probably not far away. In other words, modern films are about to regain their brilliance." Finally, Zhou smiled and said to the reporters: "The new company's name: once called Lianxing, but the final decision was Jinxing of Venus, not 　xing. The executive director is Lawyer Wu Zhengfeng. I have no investment relationship, and I am only the business director. The date of establishment is June 1."</p>
