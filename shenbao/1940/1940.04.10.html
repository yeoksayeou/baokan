<h3 id="c7">歐戰的嚴重發展 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>歐戰原有兩種可能的發展，今因挪威的中立體熊成爲問題，火燄必先向斯干蒂那維亞半島方面蔓延，演爲歐戰第二期的開始。這是本報昨日所推論，却不料其實現若是之速。昨晨五時半，德國用迅雷不及掩耳的戰略，分遣海陸空三車，突然分頭襲取挪威與丹麥兩國。到昨夜爲止，知道德車在挪威，雖遭遇了若干局部的抵抗，但已佔領了挪威京城與重要港口數處。在丹麥，因爲丹麥政府的決定不抵抗，殆已佔領了丹國全境。</p>
<p>由這一次德國所取的攻勢，由顯著的事實說明了德車組識的健全，力的强盛，指揮的活潑，行動的敏捷；雖全局勝敗如何，及此舉正當與否，又當別論，然其優點所在，實屬有目共覩，不容否認。</p>
<p>由丹麥的不抵抗而全國淪亡，竟至於朝不及夕，使人直覺的認識了抗戰的價値與必要。這是沒有更好的對比；芬蘭寡不敵衆，但抗戰共歷一百有零日，卒能與蘇聯平等議和，保全了國族的獨立自由；中國弱不敵强，但抗戰迄今一千有零日，卒能打定了最後勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>至於挪威，國都陷了，要港失了，敵軍斬關直入了；但不甘束手待斃，任人宰割，亦爲衛國爭存的天賦使命，一面遷都，一面下總動員令。往事往往不堪回首！自從英法德蘇芬相繼發生戰事之後，挪威戰戰兢兢的謀其所自信爲最善的方法：對芬蘭不可謂不冷酷。對德國不可謂不優容，對英法不可謂不嚴肅，對中立不可謂不眞誠，然而視在依然不免於陷入戰爭的洪鑪。我們不必很愚笨的代他懊喪，以爲悔不當初。他從一三九七年至一八一四年間與丹麥合而復分，從一八一四年至一九〇五年間與瑞典合而復分，以完全獨立國家的資格，周旋國際，至今不過三十五六年；其間經過歐洲第一次大戰的歷史敎訓，使他採取昨日以前的態度；而昨日所開始遭遇的，實爲挪威立國以米，空前所未有。其實第一次歐戰中的比利時，何嘗不是挪威的前車之鑒。</p>
<p>挪威異於丹麥而決心抗戰。戰爭的開展與歸宿又異於自然科學中的有其因果定律而變幻萬端；德國强大，挪威弱小，德國處心積慮，謀定而動，挪威貫逼處此，倉卒應戰，但自來意外奇績，往往有之。挪威族與瑞典芬蘭諸族，在歐洲自命爲文明的其他諸族的心目之中，皆承認之爲驍勇强悍的北人，中古時期經久的南下而攻城略地，英法人因此而有其歷史的祈禱曰：上帝乎！其拯吾儕於狂暴之北人乎！再證以最近芬蘭抗戰的忠勇，可知北人至今善戰；何况挪威滿境崇山峻嶺，戰果眞是未可知也。但是代他樂觀，終屬太嫌違反科學。更可靜觀的：德挪交綏，究非一個獨立的戰爭，僅是德國與英法戰爭的一方面；德國强敵當前而又用兵挪威，除了對英法作戰的軍略理由之外，若謂經濟理由則恐得不償失而不必遽爾若此擴大戰爭範圍；惟其爲軍略的理由，想見英法亦將爲軍略上的必要而決不坐視挪威獨當一面。然則英法至少以海軍空軍，竭力與地面上的挪威陸軍協力作戰，這是當然的推論。</p>
<p>斯干蒂那維亞牛島的火燄，昨日纔開始於挪威一隅，形態雖已昭示我們；（一）歐戰確已擴大而入第二期了，（二）德國軍略在於廻避馬奇諾陣地之堅而脅迫英吉利本身之側，（三）巴爾幹半島方面的危機因此排在可能的第三輪，（四）和局遼返，（五）劇戰迫切。吾們對此狀態，不必亟於試作更進一步的推論；而最近二三日內所應關切的還在注意消息如何報告我們；英法在軍事方面，將與挪威如何策應；與挪威爲兄弟之邦的瑞典，如何動態；與斯干蒂那維亞半島暨波羅的海具有密切關係的蘇聯，是否旁觀；荷蘭與比利時二國，當然因丹麥而感覺脣亡齒寒，是否隱忍？同時仍須注意，以巴爾幹問題爲中心的諸國，在此深刻刺激之下，是否不遽急的。計劃的，加速其「第三輪」的盤旋？</p>

<p>首相今日發言頗長、接謂斯堪的那維亞半島之土地一日不爲德國所攻擊協約國從未計及對該半島土地作任何佔據、（議員聞此言復歡呼不已、）德國所發與此相反之言、純屬揑造、毫無根據、</p>
<p>首相起立演說時、院中空氣緊張、外交席中無一虛座、西班牙蘇聯比利時阿眞廷中國大使及挪威公使均列席旁聽、</p>
<p>首相發言之初、宣布德軍已於今日攻入丹麥挪威、繼謂自戰事爆發之後、德國朝夕企圖控制斯堪的那維亞、及指揮該半島諸國之政治與經濟政策、所施之壓力、日見增重、當蘇芬戰事進行之際、德國要求有權指導半島諸國對芬蘭之政策、余於蘇芬戰事吿終時、曾有言曰、芬蘭之安全已失、但挪威瑞典之安全其曾保全乎、不意適得其反、兩國所受之危險、日見迫近、至於今日乃臨其國門矣、此諸國者、除決心自衛、並加入準備援之拒敵之方面外實無以自保、當時聆者或多以為余言過於張大其辭、今則吾人當見前發之預言、字字成爲事實矣、自該日起、大局續有發展、昨日發表之文吿、曾言及德政府要求有權在英國四週之海上擊毀中國尤其爲斯堪的那維亞諸國船隻、同時並堅主諸國應極度嚴守中立之條規、協約國決議不能長此容忍此種事態、（衆歡呼）乃照會挪威、謂英政府保留補救此種不平衡所必要計畫之權、英國已在挪威海面敷設水雷、以期阻止德國船隻之通過、而對挪威之正常貿易、毫不加以干涉、斯堪的那維亞半島之土地一日不爲德國所攻擊、協約國從未計及對該半島土地作任何佔據、德國所發與此相反之言、純出揑造、毫無根據、德政府今已發表文吿、謂已決計擔任保護丹麥挪威云（笑聲四起）</p>
<p>首相於是陳述德軍進攻之情形、謂今日拂曉、德國機械化部隊及武裝隊伍越過丹麥邊界、估據巨幅丹麥土地、聞德軍已於今晨在丹京登陸、英政府得悉駐挪威德公使今日淸晨正式要求挪威降德、謂如予拒絕、則一切抵抗均將加以粉碎、此項要求、當然立由挪威政府拒絕、（衆歡呼）吾人今聞戰事業已開始、又據報載消息、奧斯陸與克里斯蒂安桑二地已受轟炸、德軍已在挪威各地登陸、德政府聲言德軍之攻入挪威、乃報復協約國在挪威海面敷設水雷之行動、此言不能欺騙任何人、（衆歡呼）德軍同時在若干口岸登陸、輔以海軍、非倉卒所能從事、此必豫先計謀多時、始能出動、據吾人所接之情報、明白表示此舉不僅豫先計謀、而在協約國敷設水雷之前、業已發動矣、余頃所言者、德國已以佔據之事實自行證明之、聞挪威特朗特罕港今晨已爲德軍攻入、其地距德國最近之寇克斯哈文港的七百哩、假使德軍於協約國敷設水雷消息宜布後立即出動、今亦不能到達也、</p>
<p>英政府立即向挪威政府保證、英政府鑒於德軍攻入挪威、決議立予以充分之援助、英軍擬與挪軍會合作戰、目下英海軍有力之分隊已出動而在海中矣、英政府所從事之工作、爲公共利益計、未便述其詳焉、</p>
<p>吾人現與法政府互相至密切合作、以應付此加於自由民族的獨立之新威脅、余敢信德國續施此種鹵莽殘暴之侵略行動、必將自蒙其害、而助成其最後失敗也、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>勞工反對黨領袖阿特里繼起發言、對丹麥挪威之人民表示同情、並謂歐洲文明程度最高諸國之二、今受最野蠻國之攻擊矣、此種侵略、顯已準備多時、此爲絕頂野蠻侵略之另一新事件、余希望所予挪威之援助、必須充分、（衆高聲歡呼）並須迅速而有實力、（衆歡呼）吾人必須及時盡其能力、以防另一自五國受納粹鐵蹄之蹂躪、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>自由反對黨領袖辛克萊起立聲明自由黨對丹挪二國受德國野蠻之攻擊、而德國復圖加以統制不勝孤腕、頃間首相宣布之行動、必能受全國之贊助、吾人希望一切能迅速而收實效、自由黨議員曼德提及立即召集國聯會議事、並有所詢問、首相答稱、渠聞德軍已在卑根登陸、或待德軍並在那維克登陸、但此說殊屬可疑、因挪威內部有同名之地也、首相續謂渠敢信下院對於海軍之行動、在吾人續接消息之前、必不遽作裁斷、且在事實未明之前、必不願指摘海軍之行動、至於召集國聯會議一節、尙未有提議及此事者、今日首先應行之事、常首先爲之、較召集國聯會議更有效之行動正多也、首相又答覆另一議員請召集國聯會議、謂渠確希望國聯會員國將充分承認彼等對於被侵略國所負之義務也、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>挪京　今晨德國駐挪威及丹麥兩公使、以照會分致該兩國政府、照會內容如左、英法兩國業已向德國人民宣戰、現又向中立國開始作戰、英法蔑視國際法規、初擬藉封鎖之措施、使德國婦孺叟嫗、飢餓受苦、同時中立國之航行與貿易、亦受嚴重之損失、中立之觀念、亦被英國摧毀矣、又如德國雖企圖限制海戰區域、而英國則企圖移轉英倫三島所感受之危險、逐漸將海戰移至中立領水內、事實上英國曾在挪丹兩國之領水與領空中屢次採取戰事性質之行動、置國際公法於不顧、德國於開戰之初、即已逆料及此、德國利用其經濟政策、阻止英國種種陰謀、使其不能發生實效、英國封鎖政策之失敗、在最近數月內已完全暴露無遺、英法攻擊德國之堡壘、未能奏功、而德國在海上及空中、復對英法採取種種反攻之措施、使英法忽萌將戰塲移往中立國領域之企圖、當蘇芬戰事發生之際、英法兩國政府即表示欲以武力出而干涉之願望、其目的欲以北歐諸國之領土爲其活動之根據地、俾得切斷德國之鑛產來源、那爾維克若被英法佔據、則北方之鑛產、難以抵達德國、不料蘇芬議和甚速、英法之陰謀乃未能實現、英國一向具有利用北歐諸國人民爲其作戰之野心、德國政府知之已審、蘇芬議和　、德政府又接得英法企圖假借他種藉口、以逞其志、最近敬星期中、英法兩政府公開宣佈此次戰爭未必容許中立之存在、各小國應積極參加與德作戰、德國政府獲有文件、昭示英法具有不顧北歐諸國之志願爲何、而欲强其就範之野心、並有證據表示英法擬於最近數日內、出奇兵佔領北歐諸國領土之企圖、而北歐諸國復未採取抵抗侵略之措施、德國政府旁觀甚淸、並確悉挪丹兩國軍力單薄、縱欲抵抗，亦屬無濟於事、今當千鈞一髮之際、決不能縱容英法實現其陰謀、是以本日採取軍事活動、行將佔據挪丹兩國領域中之軍事重鎭、在此次戰爭中、德國政府將保護挪丹兩國、以抵抗英法之攻擊、</p>
<p>德國政府並不願事態如此發展、乃係被迫出此、其咎應由英方負責、德軍開人挪丹兩國領土時、並無仇視挪丹兩國人民之心、除非受英法行動之壓迫、德軍最高當局不擬利用德軍佔領各區爲作戰之根據地、</p>
<p>德國政府深信此舉對挪丹兩國亦爲有利、是以逆料挪丹兩國政府與人民、將了解德國採取步驟之用意、而不作抵抗也、倘有抵抗、德軍將採取一切之方法以摧毀之、其結果徒然流血犧牲、毫無效益、是以請求挪丹兩國政府從速採取各種措施、庶德軍前進之時、不至發生摩擦或困難、德國政府根據雙方邦交一向敦睦之精神、保證德國並無侵害挪丹兩國領土完整與政治獨立之用意、（九日海通社電）</p>

<p>挪京　今日淸晨德國駐挪威公使曾以口頭及書面要求挪威勿抵抗德軍之佔領、上午五時德公使謂德國認爲挪威有置身於德國軍事保護下之必要、挪威政府遂即開會考慮局勢、並決定不能對德方要求表示屈服、因其侵犯挪威之主權也、據挪威外相谷德宣稱、德公使曾說明德國如不佔領挪威、協約國即將出此、谷氏父稱、渠曾語德公使謂渠不以爲協約國有任何此項意向云、（九日路透社電）</p>

<p>挪威京城　挪威政府頃以照會一件、送達英法兩國公使、內稱、英法兩國政府業在敝國領海內三處海面敷設水雷、用以阻止自由通航、英國軍艦多艘並在各該處海面遊弋、此種舉動顯屬公開違戊國際公法、並用武力破壞敝國之主權與中立、茲特嚴軍提出抗議、溯自戰事爆發以還、敝國始終恪守有聯中立國之各項法規、不稍踰越、敞國政府之聽任各交戰國正當商運、自由通過敝國領海、實與一般人所公認之法規完全相符、上月十二日英國政府曾與敝國簽訂協定、規定敝國貨物運違禁品在內、仍得照常售予立輸往德國、今茲英法兩國竟欲利用武力、制止此種運輸、實非敝國意料所及、總之、各交戰國在敝國領海內敷設水雷之事、實非敝國所能接受、敝國政府因此不得不要求撤去此項水雷與英國軍艦、並保留權利採取各項適當措置加以應付云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>奧斯陸　挪威外相谷德昨夜在國會發言、謂挪戚中立今日已受嚴重破壞、渠信各中立國人民聞之、亦皆震驚、協約國此舉是非、自有公論、渠不必嚴詞責之、渠今將協約國來文提交國會、政府至是將與國會商討挪威所應採行以維護其權利之步驟云、谷德旋報吿四月五日英法遞交挪威與瑞與之牒文、內稱、協約國政府了解挪瑞兩國政府因德國威脅與壓迫而起之困難地位、但不得不作一種結論、以爲在目前環境下、挪瑞政府未可被視爲在各種情形中之自由機關、德國可從挪瑞獲有重要軍用品、德國之利即協的國之害、現狀如斯、協約國政府不復能忍耐之、故覺今時機已屆、不得不向挪瑞政府明白宜佈協約國政府將維持某穢必要權益、而以其所認爲必要的各種方法防衛此權益、如挪瑞政府拒不給予協約國所認爲在戰事上必要並認爲中立國所可合理的給予之商業上與航業上便利、則協約國政府勢須採行相當步驟以維護其利益、協約國雖爲自己而戰、亦爲弱國而戰、不能容許其作戰之進行爲德國所得諸挪瑞兩國之便利所妨碍、是以協約國保留其權、以採行其所認爲必要的任何步驟、俾阻止德國山此兩國獲取戰時有益於德國內有害於協約國之原料供給或便利云、協約國來牒措詞若此、渠乃向英法公使聲明協約國未有指責挪威政府爲不自由與不獨立之理由、渠以爲向挪威政府如此措詞、殊失公尤、挪威政府近已締結關於商業與航業之協定、現亦未有可表示挪威政府不尊重此項協定之理由、惟舍此而外、渠不能亦不欲作立即之答覆、而來牒亦不言及在考慮下之辦法、渠於星期六日將來牒提交政府、並發電話與瑞典外相接洽商定依此方案繕擬復文、但在復文未發出時、已有造成完全新的局面之發展矣云、谷德於報吿昨日送交挪威之協約國來文後、謂「余對於來文中所含之意旨、不擬多言、協約國之作此侵犯行爲、徒因其有權力爲之耳、協約國刻將戰事行之於挪威領海之內、以爲如此爲之、可更易獲勝也」云、國會議長漢勃羅發言、表示政府可銷除困難、而固有友誼不致受危過甚之希望、國會一對贊成外相谷德之言論、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>衆業股市開盤、買氣蓬勃、多時未見之堅挺趨勢、又於昨日　覩、下午市况初時猶甚活滋、雖獲利了結者　衆、買方吸胃奇佳、各股俱能保持上漲價格、移時忽傳德軍侵犯丹麥、市况立被影響、賣方急遽售出、價格瞬即下瀉、英聯股開盤四十二元、入後盤旋甚久、成交相鉅、收盤四十二元二五買進、五角賣出、中國墾植股昨又見二十元高價紀錄、情况活潑熱烈、無殊前數日、成交十一萬股收盤較軟、十九元二角買、四角賣出、揚子銀公司上海銀公司怡和股等交易極鉅、各以十七元二十七元半曁四十六元半回低價收盤、</p>

<p>雙馬已近一千二百元關市又復在騰、蓋以現紗銷路暢達、香港帮需要殷切、人心大振、買風殊熾、因之市面飛騰、再創新高價、二十支雙馬現紗價已達一千一百九十八元矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因英美滙兌轉縮、黃金上升、買氣奇濃、二十支雙馬現紗開價為一千一百七十五元、直漲至一千一百九十八元、中途獲利者出擋略挫、卒因現貨走銷活潑而再上、查半日間成交統計二千五百一十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲五十元外、廠方由永女廠開出二十支特金城五百五十包價爲一千一百三十元至三十五元現鈔價、今日有紗七百件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易略形起色、因黃金昂騰、及匯兌復縮、致人心轉昂、行情亦隨紗市而升三元以外、有一部份心理如果歐洲戰事擴大、國外船隻運輸缺乏、以後看好、不過目前絡續掛滬之棉、存底甚巨也、茲將現棉成交情形録左、訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因海外棉商之賣出而跌、續後即因現貨商之購買及同業之上市購買、結果收盤價格較之上日漲起五六碎音、印度市况頗爲堅定、昨日連同預測又漲五盤比、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日又因廣帮紗銷活躍、加之海外棉市之漲、及午後海外來電、傳歐局緊張、挪威業已發生衝突、本市各同業心意又轉興奮、在市搜購現貨頗烈、竟無貨以應、一般意見、紗花又看高昂、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>國來源漸見疏通、到埠日盛一日、昨日則晨間跌風更甚於前、無論國洋兩米悉曾暴瀉二元有奇、至午市因頗有動辦、復見回昂、所以結果僅降半元左右、蓋初國米上市出樣者更見擁擠、南港斛見早晚稻、繼廉價兜售、祇開三十七八元、且若蘇同帮一般中關粉粳、亦已跟踪落至限盤之下、售三十九元、聞塲外暗盤、僅一些高檔貨及客尖而已、若特常帮粳祗售四十二元、中段者四十一元、崑粳四十一元半、四十元、青泗特源稻四十一元、次至四十元出零、江北尖三十七八元左右、由虹口大昌公司輸入界內者、計粳糯繼有五千餘包、致人心一致趨下、造成暴跌之風、其中最慘者、厥爲糯米一項、因往素　盤已廉、茲再頻貶、將與碎尖並售、最低時高貨祗售三十四元半、他如較次者則僅三十三四元、且有三十二元七八角者、此蓋因釀酒銷路不動、專恃糕餅等究屬有限、</p>
<p>洋米當斯環境、亦突起猛跌、若一號西貢在中市落至四十元、三十九元、二號三十六元半、三十六元、火絞三十八元半、三十七元八角、小絞三十五元二角、三十五元、混合碎三十一元九角、次至米粞二十七元、第經此低價後忽能引起內地鄕莊客戶之搜求、與店舖添購、浮圃散戶之補進、午市形勢轉呈帶緊、各價再度回高元半、一號西貢四十元零五角、陳二號三十八元、三十七元半、火絞三十九元半、二號暹邏三十七半、小絞三十六元八角、三十六元半、混碎三十三元二角、三十二元八角、粞二十八元半、二十八元、東京砶尖三十七元半三七元、米菉特三十五元半三十五元、不渦暮氣未退、脚地欠堅、致仍一動即懈、迄收盤時、各貨市面又以趨疲均吿耳、</p>
<p>洋米又到六千餘包、係怡和洋行　泰生輪由海防運來五千零六十二包、香港裝來一千三百二十包、該輪於前日（八日）傍晚抵滬、停靠羅斯福起卸、（祖）</p>

<p>麺粉昨日續疲、蓋自　盤　低後、本街銷路依然平常、日方勒令出口粉領許可證、麵粉出口、無形受阻、　値米價一蹶不振、回　貨老車牌祇開十四元三角四分、兵船　棧單貨價祇十三元、常錫內地粉亦無形帶小、二號粉廠盤改至十三元五角後、客盤亦可改低三四角、但實際上客胃概乏新成交、</p>
<p>小麥昨亦萎靡、蓋聞本月內各廠前定之洋麥、共有五六船連袂而至、華廠雖有採辦、均在擇廉而取、聞常蘇麥已不能站定二十三元大關、中次貨別價尤廉、蕪湖中關麥價祇二十二元三四角、其潮次貨僅開二十元〇五角、成交約計一千餘包、</p>

<p>邇來黃豆市况、依然外强中乾、總之頭寸寬裕、難以刺激人心、一度雖呈緊促之態、但轉瞬已軟化、昨日銷塲、得榨油廠及厦門帮本街囤戶等問津、然胃納平常、致大局仍不脫鬆勢、</p>

<p>布市因歐戰擴大、金價猛開、業內外囤積觀念、愈形普遍、兼以客銷納胃仍健、故布價步步上升、晨市較上日漲每疋二角半至五角、午後形勢更緊、每疋　漲五角左右、大鵬富貴細布斜紋及綸昌怡和貨最爲鋒俏、本街成交現貨及四五月份坯布　十餘萬疋、漂布府綢洋紗色布二百餘、和浙閩滇粵各幫羅有採辦、惟以滬市布價劇變、　方及同業均抱觀望態度、以致　銷反形冷落、十日運香港疋頭二百七十　、</p>

<p>工部局董事競選、自今日起之兩日中、業已入決定階段、今晨十時起、於福州路萬國商團操練廳及虹口小菜塲分別舉行投票、以英美聯合陣線及日方之連日之大事活動、預料參加投票之納稅人、常在九千五百名以上、至雙方形勢、據美僑選舉委員會主席爵德談、英美納稅人業已大量增加、日方亦稱、由於第三國籍選舉人的有四五百票傾向於日方、當可超過四千票、至於英美候選人可能獲得之票數、亦認爲足與日方相當、此一幕緊張局面、實爲公共租界自舉行董事選舉以來所未有、即一九三六年日人首次提出要求增加候選人時、亦未可與之比擬、此後租界行政權之是否保障完整、能否維持現狀、抑竟爲日方所控制、休戚殊途、納稅人何去何從、實須審愼抉擇之也、英美日僑候選人名單如下、（一）阿樂滿、（二）卡納、（三）田誠、（四）海萊、（五）塙雄太郞、（六）凱自威、（七）黑田慶太郞、（八）雅培立克麥唐納（九）雷諾爾麥唐納（十）密啟爾、（十）（一）岡本一策、（十）（二）岡木乙一、（十）（二）鮑惠爾、共計爲十三人、</p>
<p>英美競選　佈置週密</p>
<p>連日英美及日僑選舉委員會、已盡其最大之努力、以獲取每一納稅人參加投票、凡納稅人對投票事宜有欠明瞭者、均可分別向選舉委員會詢問、而獲得該會之協助、且各選舉委員會、已僱用大批汽車專事接送、便利納稅人前往投票、英美選舉委員會方面、昨日亦發出大批標語、促請納稅人注意、略謂「投票選舉英僑候選人五人、及美僑候選人二人、」「勿任日僑候選人獲得絕對多數、以改變租界現狀、」「君如不明瞭投票手續、選舉委會可儘量協助、」「公共租界當絕對國際化、以利大衆、但此事須君全力支持之、」</p>
<p>一致樂觀　勝利有望</p>
<p>一般英僑納稅人心理、目前已大改舊觀、彼等過去皆抱懷疑態度、但自昨日起、已趨樂觀堅定、認爲英僑方面、勝利可操左券、因之對此次競選結果之預測、遂成爲一般人士預測之目的、萬國商團昨加預測、謂此次競選之結果、大致於明日下午三時投票截止後、即可窺其端倪、另一方面之意、則謂此事恐須至星期五晨、始可揭曉、惟英美候選人、對勝利之把握、似極有絕對樂觀之態度、蓋昨日自可靠方面獲悉、英美候選人至少可以獲得四千票也、一星期前、日方提出候選人至五名之多時、日方竟認爲日候選人至少可以獲得三千七百票、已足超過英美方面所獲得三千五百票之數、觀乎各方對工部局之日有責難形勢、遂似於日方有利、詎知英美及各界人士對工部局雖示不滿、但彼等皆更重視洋涇浜地皮章程之存在、仍當以在滬擁有權益最廣者爲標準、基於此種覜點、其可擊敗日方也可必、蓋日人在滬所擁有之財產、與英美比較、絕不相侔也、</p>
<p>猶人憒憒　眼光短淺</p>
<p>英美對於宣傳方面、尤注意於猶太人及俄僑、因彼等所占選舉票數、除英美日外、尤較任何僑民爲多、殊有舉足輕重之勢、英美宣傳機關、已特別喚起猶太人之注意、謂「日方如獲勝、則猶太人將被逐出上海、觀於日本國內曾有反猶主張、此種事件、將在滬上重演、誠屬可能、就現狀言、猶籍難民固有若干迫於威勢、惑於甘言者、尤屆時贊助日方、但亦有多數深明大義者、知日方如在本屆選舉中獲勝、則租界權益、必漸爲其所獨占、或出於婉拒、或已準備棄權、</p>
<p>俄人對日　洞若觀火</p>
<p>俄僑納稅人、雖僅二百餘人、亦有左右全局之勢、故日方對之大施誘引、即不能爲日僑候選人之助、則勸彼等棄權、勿爲英美聲援、　但據昨日自可靠方面獲悉、本埠俄僑、雖素有親日之嫌、但於此次選舉中、願投票擁護者、亦僅屬少數多數則已表示願投票擁護英美候選人、日方數日前、雖大事宣傳、謂已得俄僑策應、但就情狀觀之、此種宣傳、顯已失敗、昨據居於蘇州河南區域某俄僑談、俄僑對於霞飛路、上所見之俄文宣傳品、均洞察其為日方所為、表示渠等對日人面目、固早已了解、即以哈爾濱俄僑之待遇為例、即可瞭然也、據　、在哈爾濱之大部俄僑、已爲日方所逐、俄僑居住之區域、亦大部爲日人侵佔、此外、就大津·北平·及瀋陽之情形而言、亦復如是、俄僑居於該三處者、大部在日人建立「東亞新秩序」口號下、全部遭受莫大之損失、全無立錐之地、遂相率逃避來滬、蓋彼等認爲上海乃俄僑之最大自由天地也、詎料俄僑在滬居住未久、日人勢力、又復擴大、甚至有使俄僑遭遇與哈爾濱同樣運命之可能、故俄僑痛定思痛、决不願日人在此次競選中獲得勝利、助成其攫取工部局之行政權、蓋彼等均怵於往事、如新聞紙之遭受箝制、親友之時吿失踪、或恐再演於上海也、故俄僑所鰓鰓爲慮者、實與其他各國僑民不同、蓋其他各國僑民深懼日人得勢、經濟將受致命打擊、而俄僑所恐懼者、乃爲其日常生活不得安定也、</p>
<p>日候選人　舉行茶會</p>
<p>日方鑒於連日情勢發展、岌岌可危、甚以爲慮、於是異想天開、由候選人塙雄太郎、以觀櫻為名、於八日下午、邀請各國在滬名流及外交官員、在其金神父路寓所茶會、冀因此獲一臂之助、</p>
<p>年會定期　十七舉行</p>
<p>外僑納稅人年會、亦決於本月十七日舉行、其議程如下、（一）推莫肅推事爲大會主席、（二）推納西君爲大會秘書、（三）前次大會所採用之議事規則、本屆會議仍當適用、（四）推克隆君爲次年地產委員、（五）推選次年之醫院管理員四人、（六）報吿至去年十二月三十一日爲止報吿及帳目、（七）贊助及通過上屆董事所提出之一九四〇年新預算案、（八）由本屆大會承認有效、並予採用之新議程規則、保持至有效時期下屆、會爲止、</p>
<p>陳霆銳氏　補充華委</p>
<p>公共租界納稅華人會本年度應推選之工部局華董五人、董委五人、及地皮委員一人、除前已依照大多數代表五十一人之提議、仍請虞洽卿·林康侯·等繼續連任外、尙有應推委員一人、昨已補推前任委員陳霆銳祖任、當即正式函知工部局查照矣、</p>

<p>廣陵梅花嶺，舊有明臣史閣部衣冠墓，乾隆年間侍郎彭元瑞得公家　遺像，敬呈御覽，賜謚忠正，建修祠宇，所以卸製詩章，及羣臣和韻，奉旨勒石祠壁，以勵臣節，春秋官為致祭，甚盛典也。咸同間，兵燹後，祠宇碑蹟，蕩然無存，近知閣部之裔孫兆霖，以先德水可泯滅，特挽各大憲捐貲修墓建祠，重刋遺集，客有過之者，見梅花樹石，漸復舊觀，維御碑樓，尚未重建。墓前有鐵砲一尊，係崇禎年間所製，鑄造兵部大堂史，想係當年用兵時之遺物，前為女徽某縣挖濠得之，今兆霖亦乞歸，請存祠內，亦不忘手澤之遺　也。並在申江裝池店又得讀戊子年閣部　　史德　，與門人戈寗擬慕梅花嶺圖卷內書與祭文兩則，並題韻千言。又見顧南雅先生為梅花醫院山長時，慕得閣部硃衣小像，上書御製詩章上論筆記。復由店主人出示閣部手札印文軍書奏報百件，洵為稀世之寶物。嗣悉皆由兆霖於去冬在滬上所得，具奏文小像用重價購回。祠圖手卷早為甬上蔡君祿卿收藏，　兆霖情乞而得者。夫以上各物，能於二百年後，仍歸　氏，雖　後裔之苦心搜求，然非鬼神默為呵護，其能歷烽火而無恙哉。更有閣部親書家訓十幅，亦由兆霖購得，訓辭真切，筆法挺秀，嗜古者，尤愛不釋手云。</p>

<h3 id="c105">人間地獄　「麵」燕子窠速寫 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 魯羽</p>
<p>當大地迥蕩着春意，一切都從沉睡中醒過來的時候，在蘇州河北岸一條僻陋骯髒的小弄內那把吸「白麵」（亦稱白粉）看成第二生命的一羣，又將活躍起來了。在這條堆積着垃圾，排泄物，終日揚溢着發霉的使人窒息氣味的一條狹隘小弄內，又被這　羣侵佔着了，相同一羣燕子似的，當春天回來的時候，他們也追隨着歸到他們會經逗溜過一時的老家來了。</p>
<p>於是像遊牧民族篷帳式的窠居，又映進我們的眼簾。這種一面臨牆三面和頂上都蓋着破席簡陋之建築物，擠軋在一起的，總共有七所之多，高約三尺，裏面大致可容三四人，在白日裏經常可瞧見三四個人圍住一枝蠟燭頭，儷僂着腰，用一張厚紙捲成一圓筒，貪婪地向錫紙上在吸着這殺人不見血的「白麵」。</p>
<p>他們差不多都是一樣的瘦弱和襤樓，這可證明他們的肉和血已被這毒物吸收完了，僅靠着這一張皮和幾根骨頭所支持着的軀殼，搖搖擺擺鑽進鑽出的忙碌着。</p>
<p>每當他們從高麗佬（賣白麵者）的手中接着一只小紙包的時候，猶似獲得一塊稀世的珍寳，一陣喜悅掠過他們瘦削而穢垢的臉上，這就是說他們活在世上唯一的目的是建築在這一小包的恩物上。</p>
<p>然而奇怪的是在這米價日騰，人們連肚子尙且管不住的當兒，從那裏去打算來這一筆錢來維持「白麵」呢，况且這又是一筆不小的數目，（據他們說，每人每天得吃二包　白麵一，分三次吃，實價是每包二角。）這是大家都會感到驚訝的吧？可是你只要訪問一下我們這條弄內的住戶，他們都會吿訴這個來源的。</p>
<p>原來他們的大本營都在老閘橋畔的菜市塲上，趁買賣正忙碌着，人們熙熙攘攘無暇顧及的機會，就使用那熟練而敏捷的手段，攫取一點蔬菜之類的食物，然後再把它用賤價出售。因此在我們的弄內就流行着一句「老閘橋是他們儲蓄銀行」的戲語。</p>
<p>不過在使用這種法門時，湊巧給贓主覺察了，那麼這一頓生活是很難免的，拳和脚猛烈地加在他的身上，於是他們就用低卑得無可比擬的語詞求着　，但是只要一轉身，他又在做着同樣的勾當了，也許冉受一次同樣的拳脚。天哪！這是什麼魔力在支使他呀！他們可說是已沒有靈魂，沒有　肉，在這世界上除了「白麵」，旁的他們已沒有什麼留戀了。</p>
<p>除了老閘橋以外，在旁的時侯，只要是値幾　便於携帶的東西，都在他們被扒之例，尤其是這條弄內的住戶，隨時隨地都得嚴厲的提防着，不然只要你不小心，就會很快的缺少東西。</p>
<p>我會向一個較年老的吸「白麵」者，詢問他關於怎樣吃上「白麵」的原因。我許多日來一向是這樣的懷疑着爲什麼對於這含毒很深的「白麵」而有這許多人去親近他，我以爲也許他們有特殊的苦衷也說不定。但是這一老者却不是照我所問的回答我，他只是喃喃地講着：他從前也是好出身，自從一吸上「白麵」，就弄得家破人散一，潦倒不堪，現在後悔已不及了。最後他又說：『　！先生，這是我們前生欠的××人的債，因此今生就得零零碎碎償還給他們，你們不曉得呢，餓幾天肚子到不打緊，可是當（白麵」的癮上來時，眞是此死還要難受呢！』</p>
<p>不錯，這里我們不應當忽略的，就是那每天下午二個或三個在弄堂口踱來踱去高個子的高麗人，他們都穿着挺漂亮的西裝，手里拎一只布製的小袋，候着每隻顫抖而　臢的手里摸着幾張角粟伸到他們面前的時侯，在他們鶩黑的臉膛上是閃着多麼得意的光彩。</p>
<p>記得在去年，曾有一次他們被「黑車子」裝了進去，可是過不了幾天，他們又來了，幷且還帶着更得意的高傲的微笑洋溢在臉上，好像在說一怕行麼？我們又來了！」誰會不知道呢，他們是有着更有力的　腰的。</p>
<p>老的消滅了，新的彌補上來，在這條小弄堂內，永遠是在起着這一種的新陳代謝作用，每天總有幾個生的面　在我的眼前搖晃着,有的甚至於初來時還穿着較整齊的衣衫，但過不了幾天也是同樣的消減了，這是多麼厲害的毒化政策呀！我們民族的意志竟會如此地消沉下去嗎？我恐懼地忖度着，雖然自己也覺得這是多餘的。</p>
<p>在這里我們只有懇切地期望治安者的當局能想出一個積極的，有効的辦法來，使正沉湎在苦海中的人得以脫離。同時這對於租界治安，也有着很大關聯的。</p>
<h3 id="c106">做人的道理考寶早掃　書蔬魚猪 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 強弓</p>
<p>最近重慶當局公宴全國國民敎育代表的席間，蔣院長訓話中，有一段提到曾文正公敎育子弟的八個字：老，寳，早，掃，書，蔬，魚，猪，要我們今日的學生，在這八個字上用功夫，而且要每一個學校，都按照這個原則，看環境所宜，客觀情形所許可，設法做去云云。這實在每個人都應奉行的做人的道理。</p>
<p>這八個字，非常明顯，不必解釋；簡單說：就是「仁愛惜物」，其旨趣便是敎人接近日常生活，而在日常生活當中，求取做人的道理。</p>
<p>八個字，個個字都是做得到的，以前大家似乎對於這八方面是忽略過去的；忽略這八個字，我們也可說他還沒有眞的接觸日常生活；沒有接觸日常生活，則他也許還沒有在做人，而好像做着類似『超人』（指超越了人的範圍而言）的人。這是我們應該痛改前非而努力注意這八個字的一點意義。</p>
<p>過去好許多事實吿訴我們，學生祇知求學，而忘了『學以致用』的眞　：衹知過着空　的生活，而沒有注意至實生活。好像在學校求學的學生和學校以外的人是兩截的。因此，學生一出校門，簡直大塊茫茫，感冒了托何處。一陣『前程遠大』的掌聲送出校門之後，立刻給社會撇在一旁，一程莫展；即或不被　　而也頗　　　塞途。理論也，　義也，Out　lme，口　　錄也，引經據典也，定義也，則也法也等，沒有日常生活以至於踏進社會怎樣處理頭一個步驟，怎樣從　本上的大道理融化到社會當中，這便形成了許多有識之士的『敎育擱淺論』的牢懷滿</p>
<p>這裏的中心意思，不是叫學生輕視智識，是要學生重實在的知識，讀一句　，　幾行文，看幾卷　，不要落空，一方面求舉，一方面格物。這扌把國家培植人扌的用心，一個一個都有用了。八個字不過摧促人們注意日常生活的一方面，而從此更充實做人處世的道理。</p>

<p>第甘二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>金澹雲那裏肯上坐，却被邵慧華一拉，把她按在座上。原來不要小覷了邵慧華，她的身體個兒並不高，她有氣力，他父　得一些柔術。兩三個健男子，正不放在她心上，要是在中國戰前的七八年，盛行武俠小說的當兒，又要煊染得把一個邵慧華描寫成俠女子咧。可是瞿無雙今天的請客，也可以算得「一事兩勾當」。一則謂了金澹雲，歡迎她的新婚；二則她是聯絡這一班前進的女性，除了邵慧華是本報館裏的人，此外的幾位，也都能提起筆來，寫一篇文字的。譬如請朱愛人寫些醫學上的意見，何家兩位小姐寫些紡織上的意見，吳君素寫些敎育上的意見，金澹雲方面史多了，對於歐美社會上，交際上，也可以發抒意見。那都是她所編輯的「婦女園地」上，與「婦女生活」的雜誌上所需要的。其實這些費用，也都是由報館裏開支，並不要瞿無雙小姐自己掏腰包，那就是所謂交際費了。像這樣的一個大報館，每年的交際費，歸入正當的支出。所以他們的大餐廳，也差不多天天在那裏請客的。決不像中國二十年前的報界裏，只有人家的宴會裏，常常請到新聞記者，而新聞記者從來不大請人的。且說今天瞿無隻請她們吃的是西菜，但名爲西菜，材料都是中國所固有的。連一切器血，也都是自製的國貨。而且這一家報館裏，更爲考究，所有一切磁盆，刀又，飯巾等等，都是定製的，都有它報館的名字的。連請客吸的香烟，以及火柴匣上，都印有報館的名稱。這個餐廳却有兩種菜，一種是中菜，一種是西菜，聽各人性之所好。但材料方面，却國貨居多數，只有極少是舶來品，那不過是屬於罐頭食物之類罷了。她們飲宴中間，隨意談話。朱愛人道：「想不到吾國新聞事業，發展得如此之快。我小時節，就聽得我們祖父講起，在戰爭時代，中國的報紙，被壓迫得喘不過氣來，却也有今天這一日。當時我聽得祖父說過，有三個人辦了一個報館。一個人管編輯，一個人管印刷，一個人管發行。而他們的報，却辦得非常精彩。尤其是他們的報館資產，說出來眞敎人要笑煞，總共不過一擔，挑在肩頭上，就可以上道。』　（二六一）</p>

<p>余聖嘆說，做文章分明如獅子滾繡球相似，本只是一個球，却敎獅子放出通身解數，左盤右旋，右盤左旋，再不放脫，却不擒住，然而獅子之所以如此滾，如彼滾，實都爲球，（大意如此）。我說編劇和演劇，也應採用這個方法。</p>
<p>大鍾劇社公演的桃花源，劇旨很足以發人深省，堅人信仰，不能不算一齣很好的醒世寓言劇，可惜太把劇旨做實在了，不敢放鬆一涉，彷彿獅子一口把繡球咬住了，那還滾些什麽呢？末塲的歌舞，有幾位姑娘，都長得不錯，尤其是那位飾花神的，更具着一種天眞嫵媚，不過藝術方面，還覺得不甚嫻熟，舞蹈的姿勢，還覺得不够美化。演劇最要緊是能吸住觀衆緊張的情緒，的確寓言劇的編導，也比他種劇更覺難於處理。以我的觀察，大鍾社的社員裏面，學識高深的，或許比別家更多些。我很希望有高深學識的人，能够借藝術的力量，發揮到深入各級人們的心間。但是那天劇院裏的觀衆，不但是我和我的友人，臉上都透露着一點沉悶無聊的神色，希望大鍾劇社能在藝術方面，更求進一步的深造，我自信這是個善意而忠實的蒭獻。</p>

<p>沒有到上海但有到香港的可能</p>
<p>白楊來滬的消息，是遠在去年新華公司邀請他們（及高占非）攝片的時候傳起，但是一方面是中國製片廠新片待拍，再則高占非如果也回上海的話，還有點小小糾紛。所以盛傳一時的白楊高占非來滬，終於連新華尤許他們在香港攝片約計劃都沒有成功。可是最近外間又盛傳着白揚回滬的消息，而且是已經回來了（沒有談到高占非）；再而且已經來滬二三個星期了。這消息自然是不可靠的，以猜測來說，白楊是一位著名的影星，她秘密來滬或許可能，然而來滬了二三星期竟然沒有一點「下文」，這是決計無法「秘密」到這樣程度的。以事實來證明，則三月十六日的重慶新蜀報上登着她和顧而已等上演「塞上風雲」的廣吿，以及四日她在魏鶴齡婚禮中做過女賓相，所以她的來滬和顧而巳的死耗同時證明了是不確實的。</p>
<p>可是從香港方面得釗了另外一個消息，據寫信來的朋友說：「最近某公司（來函）在函商白楊高占非來此（香港）攝片，接洽的程度如何，並無詳細情形；一有確訊，當續告。………」</p>
<p>所謂某公司者，聰明的讀者或許可以想到是那一家公司，然而「確訊」當然在不可知之天，從這個消息更可以證明白楊沒有到上海。</p>

<p>London - Reuters has learned that when Germany began its invasion, Jutland housed Danish troops. The total number of troops throughout Denmark did not exceed 25,000. If the Danes had sufficient time to mobilize, they could have mustered 100,000 men, but Germany's "blitzkrieg strategy" gave them no chance. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>London - The "blitzkrieg strategy" that Germany has long awaited has been realized today. The first to bear the brunt are Denmark and Norway on the Scandinavian Peninsula. German forces have invaded the two countries with lightning speed. At dawn today, less than 24 hours after Britain announced it had laid mines in three areas of Norwegian territorial waters, German forces crossed the border from land and entered Schleswig in the Jutland Peninsula of Denmark. At the same time, German transport ships carrying troops landed on the island of Zealand, where the Danish capital Copenhagen is located. Other German forces landed on the Norwegian coast and occupied Copenhagen at 8:00 AM, meeting no resistance. According to reports from Amsterdam, all of Denmark was effectively under German control by noon. Upon receiving news of German forces landing on its southern coast in the early morning, the Norwegian government issued a general mobilization order. It is now believed that the Norwegian capital Oslo has fallen. The Norwegian government has declared war on Germany and is preparing to resist with all its might. German forces met with slight resistance from Norwegian land batteries in the Oslofjord but have landed on the mainland. It is also reported that Oslo was bombed by air. Several towns along the Norwegian coast have been occupied. The Norwegian government has hurriedly moved from Oslo to Hamar. The Danish government is less fortunate; it is reported that after the fall of Copenhagen, it is entirely under German control. The British and French governments have assured the Norwegian government that they will provide full assistance. Britain and France have not yet taken action against Denmark because the Danish government has lost its freedom, and the Danish ambassador in London has not received instructions to negotiate with the British Foreign Office. According to Swedish radio announcements, the Swedish government has issued a general mobilization order, which has since been denied. German broadcasts claim that German forces have laid mines in the Skagerrak off the major Swedish ports. Since the German attacks on Denmark and Norway, telephone communications between the Scandinavian Peninsula and the rest of Europe have been cut off, so details of this sudden development have not been available. Only fragments of information have been transmitted. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - The State Department has received a report from the U.S. Minister to Norway stating that, according to a notification from the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Norway has declared war on Germany. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>New York - Local radio stations have just broadcast news stating that after the Danish government decided not to resist the German invasion, the entire territory was occupied by German troops within a few hours. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Times correspondent in Copenhagen reported by long-distance telephone, before censorship was imposed, that German troops entered Danish territory from the northern border of Schleswig at 5:30 AM this morning (Greenwich time) and immediately occupied the Danish city of Sønderborg. Local troops have retreated north. In addition, three German cruisers have landed troops in the Danish capital, and the streets of the capital have been occupied. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>New York - According to well-informed sources here, the State Department has received a telegram from the U.S. Minister to Norway stating that Norway has entered a state of war with Germany. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>New York - News has just been received here from a broadcast by the Swedish capital's radio station stating that the Swedish government has issued a general mobilization order. According to reports from Berlin, the Norwegian capital Oslo has been bombed by German aircraft. (Havas Urgent Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Oslo - At 6:45 PM this evening, Berlin officially announced that Oslo had been occupied by German forces and that the Norwegian government had moved to the city of Hamar. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Oslo - The local radio station broadcast this morning at 8:00 AM that the German navy had entered the Oslofjord last night. Norwegian coastal defense forces were ineffective in their resistance. The Norwegian government has moved to Hamar in the north. In addition, the western port of Bergen was occupied after fierce fighting. German troops have also landed at Arendal. The southern Kristiansand fortress is under attack by German air and naval forces. The northern port of Trondheim is also said to have fallen. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Oslo - It has just been learned that German troops have occupied the port of Narvik in northern Norway and have placed the road connecting the port to the western bay under their control. Narvik is a center of North European commercial shipping. German iron ore purchased from Sweden is shipped out through this port. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Oslo - The Naval Department has just issued a broadcast stating that several German warships sailed into the Oslofjord last night, braving fire from Norwegian fortresses. One German warship engaged in fierce artillery battles with the Oscarsborg Fortress at 4:30 AM today. One German cruiser ran aground after entering the Oslofjord, while other ships opened fire. The area of Horten is believed to be occupied by German forces. The port of Trondheim has been captured, and the port of Bergen has also fallen. In addition, one German warship made contact with a Norwegian warship before arriving at the port of Narvik, where the soldiers on board immediately landed.

<p>Oslo - The Norwegian News Agency has released news stating, "It has just been learned that a total of 90 to 100 German ships, mostly small auxiliary vessels and armed fishing boats, with only a few large ships, passed through the Kattegat and headed north this morning." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>The Hague - "News Daily" carries news from Oslo stating that six or seven German warships have passed through the Sound, and a large number of German ships sailed from German ports at 11:00 AM this morning (local time), passing through the Kattegat and heading northwest. The general Norwegian public believes that a naval battle between British and German fleets may occur. (Havas Small Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>London - The Copenhagen correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" reported last night that a German fleet sailed through the Kattegat yesterday. The fleet consisted of approximately 80 to 100 warships, including a aircraft carrier. The German fleet's actions were still secret yesterday, but it was said in London that the fleet was carrying out mine-laying operations in the Skagerrak. It is believed that this is a severe measure by Germany to counter British naval disputes. British naval sources claim that Britain welcomes the German fleet's challenge. The stronger the combat power, the better. British naval correspondents believe that Germany can muster a maximum of 30 warships on the surface of the sea, but the British navy is more than capable of dealing with them and destroying them.

<h3 id="e7">Serious Development of the European War <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The European war originally had two possible developments. Now, because the neutrality of Norway has become an issue, the flames will first spread to the Scandinavian Peninsula, marking the beginning of the second phase of the European war. This was the conclusion of this newspaper yesterday, but it was unexpected that it would materialize so quickly. At 5:30 AM yesterday, Germany, using a blitzkrieg strategy, dispatched naval, land, and air forces to suddenly attack Norway and Denmark. As of last night, it is known that in Norway, although German forces encountered some local resistance, they had already occupied the Norwegian capital and several key ports. In Denmark, due to the Danish government's decision not to resist, Germany has virtually occupied the entire country.</p>
<p>The offensive taken by Germany this time clearly demonstrates the soundness of German organization, the strength of its forces, the vigor of its command, and the agility of its actions. Although the overall outcome and the righteousness of this move are subject to further discussion, its advantages are evident and undeniable.</p>
<p>The fall of Denmark without resistance, happening virtually overnight, makes people directly recognize the value and necessity of resistance. There is no better comparison: Finland, outnumbered, resisted for over a hundred days and was ultimately able to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union on equal terms, preserving its national independence and freedom. China, weaker than its opponent, has resisted for over a thousand days and has finally laid the foundation for ultimate victory.</p>
<p>As for Norway, its capital has fallen, its key ports have been lost, and enemy forces have entered directly. However, it is not willing to surrender and be slaughtered. It is also fulfilling its inherent mission of defending the country and fighting for survival. It is relocating its capital and issuing a general mobilization order. Past events are often unbearable to recall! Since Britain, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Finland have successively engaged in war, Norway has cautiously sought what it believed to be the best course of action: it cannot be said that it was not cold towards Finland; it cannot be said that it was not accommodating towards Germany; it cannot be said that it was not serious towards Britain and France; it cannot be said that it was not sincere towards neutrality. However, it still cannot avoid falling into the furnace of war. We do not need to foolishly regret on its behalf, thinking that it should have acted differently in the past. It was united with Denmark from 1397 to 1814 and then separated; it was united with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 and then separated. As a fully independent nation, it has interacted with the international community for only thirty-five or six years. During that time, it experienced the historical lessons of the First World War, which led it to adopt the attitude it held until yesterday. What it began to experience yesterday is unprecedented in the history of Norwegian nationhood. In fact, Belgium in the First World War was a precedent for Norway.</p>
<p>Norway differs from Denmark in its determination to resist. The development and outcome of war differ from the cause-and-effect laws of natural science and are subject to endless changes. Germany is strong, Norway is weak; Germany has planned carefully and acted deliberately, while Norway is forced to respond hastily. However, unexpected miracles often occur. The Norwegian people, along with the Swedish and Finnish peoples, are recognized by other European nations as brave and fierce northerners. In the Middle Ages, they repeatedly moved south, attacking and conquering lands. As a result, the English and French had a historical prayer: "God, save us from the violent northerners!" This, combined with the courage and loyalty of Finland's recent resistance, shows that the northerners are still good at fighting. Moreover, Norway is full of towering mountains and ridges, so the outcome of the war is truly uncertain. However, being optimistic on its behalf would be too contrary to science. More to be observed is that the conflict between Germany and Norway is not an independent war but merely one aspect of the war between Germany and Britain and France. Germany has strong enemies in front of it and is also using troops in Norway. Besides military reasons for fighting against Britain and France, it is feared that economic reasons would outweigh the gains and not necessarily warrant such an expansion of the war. Since the reason is military strategy, it can be imagined that Britain and France will also act out of military necessity and will certainly not stand by and watch Norway bear the brunt alone. Therefore, it is a natural deduction that Britain and France, at least with their navy and air force, will do their best to cooperate with the Norwegian army on the ground.</p>
<p>The flames on the Scandinavian Peninsula only began in one corner of Norway yesterday, but the situation has already revealed to us: (1) the European war has indeed expanded and entered its second phase; (2) German military strategy lies in avoiding the strength of the Maginot Line and threatening the side of England itself; (3) the crisis in the Balkans is therefore ranked in a possible third round; (4) peace is remote; (5) intense fighting is imminent. We do not need to rush to make further inferences about this situation. What we should be concerned about in the next two or three days is how the news reports to us; how Britain and France will coordinate with Norway in military terms; how Sweden, which is a fraternal nation to Norway, will act; whether the Soviet Union, which has close ties with the Scandinavian Peninsula and the Baltic Sea, will stand by; whether the Netherlands and Belgium, of course, feel that their lips are cold because Denmark has died, will endure? At the same time, it is still necessary to pay attention to whether the countries centered on the Balkan issue, under this profound stimulus, will not quickly accelerate their "third round" of planning and circling.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Chamberlain Announces in the House of Commons: Britain and France Assure Norway of Full Assistance; Powerful Naval Detachment Dispatched; Germany's Tyranny Will Surely Backfire <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Great Britain has resolved to provide Norway with full assistance. A powerful detachment of the British Navy has already been dispatched to sea. The entire House heard this and cheered loudly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke at length today, stating that as long as the land of the Scandinavian Peninsula was not attacked by Germany, the Allied nations never considered occupying any land on the peninsula. (Members of Parliament cheered again at this statement.) The opposite statements issued by Germany are purely fabrications and have no basis.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister rose to speak, the atmosphere in the House was tense. There was not a single empty seat in the diplomatic gallery. The ambassadors of Spain, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Argentina, China, and the Norwegian Minister were all present as observers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, the Prime Minister announced that German troops had invaded Denmark and Norway today. He went on to say that since the outbreak of the war, Germany has been trying day and night to control Scandinavia and to direct the political and economic policies of the countries of the peninsula. The pressure exerted has been increasing daily. When the Soviet-Finnish War was in progress, Germany demanded the right to guide the policies of the countries of the peninsula toward Finland. When the Soviet-Finnish War ended, I said that the safety of Finland had been lost, but was the safety of Norway and Sweden preserved? Unexpectedly, the opposite happened, and the danger faced by the two countries became increasingly imminent, and today it has reached their doorstep. These countries have no way to protect themselves except to resolve to defend themselves and join the preparations to assist in resisting the enemy. At the time, many listeners thought that my words were exaggerated, but now we must see that the predictions made earlier have become facts, word for word. Since that day, the situation has continued to develop. The communique issued yesterday mentioned that the German government demanded the right to destroy Chinese ships, especially those of the Scandinavian countries, on the seas around Britain, while insisting that the countries strictly adhere to the rules of neutrality. The Allied nations decided that they could no longer tolerate this situation (the crowd cheered). They informed Norway that the British government reserved the right to implement necessary plans to remedy this imbalance. Britain has laid mines in Norwegian waters to prevent German ships from passing through, without interfering with Norway's normal trade in any way. As long as the land of the Scandinavian Peninsula was not attacked by Germany, the Allied nations never considered occupying any land on the peninsula. The opposite statements issued by Germany are purely fabrications and have no basis. The German government has now issued a statement saying that it has decided to take on the protection of Denmark and Norway (laughter erupted).</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then described the situation of the German invasion, saying that at dawn today, German mechanized units and armed forces crossed the Danish border and occupied a large area of Danish land. It is reported that German troops landed in Danzig this morning. The British government learned that the German Minister to Norway formally demanded Norway's surrender to Germany this morning, saying that if it refused, all resistance would be crushed. This demand was of course immediately rejected by the Norwegian government (the crowd cheered). We now hear that the war has begun, and it is also reported that Oslo and Kristiansand have been bombed, and German troops have landed in various parts of Norway. The German government claimed that the German troops' invasion of Norway was a retaliation for the Allied nations laying mines in Norwegian waters. This statement cannot deceive anyone (the crowd cheered). German troops landed simultaneously in several ports, aided by the Navy, which could not have been done hastily. This must have been planned long in advance before it could be launched. According to the information we have received, it clearly shows that this move was not only planned in advance, but was launched before the Allied nations laid the mines. What I said earlier, Germany has already proven by the fact of occupation. It is reported that the Norwegian port of Trondheim was attacked by German troops this morning, which is 700 miles from the closest German port of Cuxhaven. Even if German troops had immediately set out after the news of the Allied nations laying mines was announced, they would not have been able to arrive by now.</p>
<p>The British government immediately assured the Norwegian government that, in view of the German troops' invasion of Norway, the British government has resolved to provide full assistance immediately. British troops plan to cooperate with Norwegian troops in combat. At present, a powerful detachment of the British Navy has been dispatched to sea. The work that the British government is engaged in is for the public interest, and it is inconvenient to describe it in detail.</p>
<p>We are now cooperating very closely with the French government to deal with this new threat to the independence of free nations. I am confident that Germany's continued reckless and brutal acts of aggression will surely harm itself and contribute to its final defeat (the crowd cheered).</p>
<p>Labor Opposition Leader Attlee then rose to speak, expressing sympathy for the people of Denmark and Norway, and said that two of the most civilized countries in Europe are now being attacked by the most barbaric country. This invasion has clearly been prepared for a long time. This is another new incident of extreme barbaric aggression. I hope that the assistance given to Norway must be sufficient (the crowd cheered loudly) and must be rapid and effective (the crowd cheered). We must do everything in our power in time to prevent another five countries from being ravaged by the Nazi iron heel (the crowd cheered).</p>
<p>Liberal Opposition Leader Sinclair rose and declared that the Liberal Party was overwhelmed by the barbaric German attack on Denmark and Norway, and that Germany was trying to control them. The actions announced by the Prime Minister just now must be supported by the whole country. We hope that everything can be quick and effective. Liberal Party Member of Parliament Mandel mentioned immediately convening a meeting of the League of Nations and made some inquiries. The Prime Minister replied that he had heard that German troops had landed in Bergen, or were waiting for German troops to land in Narvik, but this statement was highly doubtful, because there was a place with the same name inside Norway. The Prime Minister continued that he dared to believe that the House of Commons would not rush to make a decision on the Navy's actions before we continued to receive news, and would not want to criticize the Navy's actions before the facts were clear. As for convening a meeting of the League of Nations, no one has yet proposed this matter. The first thing that should be done today is always the first thing to do, and there are many more effective actions than convening a meeting of the League of Nations. The Prime Minister also replied to another Member of Parliament's request to convene a meeting of the League of Nations, saying that he sincerely hoped that the member states of the League of Nations would fully recognize the obligations they owed to the invaded countries (Reuters News Agency, 9th).</p>
<h3 id="e9">German Government's Note to Norway and Denmark Explains the Intention of the Invasion <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Oslo – This morning, the German ministers to Norway and Denmark sent notes to the governments of the two countries, respectively. The contents of the notes are as follows: Britain and France have already declared war on the German people, and now they have begun to wage war on neutral countries. Britain and France disregard international law and regulations, initially planning to use blockade measures to make German women, children, and old people suffer from hunger, while the navigation and trade of neutral countries also suffer serious losses. The concept of neutrality has also been destroyed by Britain. Furthermore, although Germany has attempted to limit the area of naval warfare, Britain has attempted to shift the danger felt by the British Isles and gradually move the naval warfare into neutral territorial waters. In fact, Britain has repeatedly taken actions of a warlike nature in the territorial waters and airspace of Norway and Denmark, disregarding international law. Germany had anticipated this from the beginning of the war. Germany uses its economic policies to prevent Britain's various conspiracies from taking effect. The failure of Britain's blockade policy has been completely exposed in recent months. Britain's attack on Germany's fortresses has failed, while Germany has taken various counter-offensive measures against Britain and France at sea and in the air, causing Britain and France to suddenly have the intention of moving the battlefield to the territory of neutral countries. When the Soviet-Finnish War occurred, the British and French governments expressed their desire to intervene by force. Their purpose was to use the territory of the Nordic countries as a base for their activities, so as to cut off Germany's mineral resources. If Narvik were occupied by Britain and France, the northern minerals would be difficult to reach Germany. Unexpectedly, the Soviet-Finnish peace talks were very quick, and Britain and France's conspiracy failed to materialize. Britain has always had the ambition to use the people of the Nordic countries to fight for it. The German government has learned this thoroughly. After the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, the German government received information that Britain and France were attempting to achieve their goals under other pretexts. In the most recent week, the British and French governments publicly announced that this war may not allow the existence of neutrality, and that small countries should actively participate in the war against Germany. The German government has documents showing what Britain and France's intentions are to disregard the wishes of the Nordic countries and to force them to submit, and there is evidence that Britain and France plan to occupy the territory of the Nordic countries by surprise in the next few days. However, the Nordic countries have not taken measures to resist aggression. The German government has been watching very closely and is well aware that the military strength of Norway and Denmark is weak, and even if they want to resist, it will be of no avail. Now, at this critical moment, it cannot tolerate Britain and France realizing their conspiracy. Therefore, today it is taking military action and will occupy the military strongholds in the territory of Norway and Denmark. In this war, the German government will protect Norway and Denmark from British and French attacks.</p>
<p>The German government does not wish for things to develop in this way, but is forced to do so. The blame should be borne by the British. When German troops enter the territory of Norway and Denmark, they have no hostility towards the people of Norway and Denmark. Unless oppressed by British and French actions, the German military authorities do not intend to use the areas occupied by German troops as a base for operations.</p>
<p>The German government firmly believes that this move is also beneficial to Norway and Denmark. Therefore, it anticipates that the governments and people of Norway and Denmark will understand the purpose of Germany's actions and will not resist. If there is resistance, the German troops will take all measures to destroy it. The result will only be bloodshed and sacrifice, with no benefit. Therefore, it requests that the governments of Norway and Denmark take various measures as soon as possible, so that no friction or difficulties will occur when the German troops advance. The German government, based on the spirit of consistently harmonious diplomatic relations between the two sides, guarantees that Germany has no intention of infringing upon the territorial integrity and political independence of Norway and Denmark (Haitong News Agency, 9th).</p>

<p>Oslo – This morning, the German Minister to Norway verbally and in writing requested that Norway not resist the German occupation. At 5 a.m., the German Minister said that Germany considered it necessary for Norway to be placed under German military protection. The Norwegian government then held a meeting to consider the situation and decided that it could not express submission to the German demands, as it violated Norway's sovereignty. According to Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht, the German Minister said that if Germany did not occupy Norway, the Allied nations would do so. Koht said that he had told the German Minister that he did not believe that the Allied nations had any such intention (Reuters News Agency, 9th).</p>
<h3 id="e11">Norway's Note to Britain Protests the Violation of Neutrality <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Oslo – The Norwegian government recently delivered a note to the ministers of Britain and France, stating that the governments of Britain and France have laid mines in three areas of the territorial sea of our country, in order to prevent free navigation, and several British warships are cruising in these areas. This action is clearly a public violation of international law and a violation of our country's sovereignty and neutrality by force. We hereby lodge a solemn protest. Since the outbreak of the war, our country has always strictly adhered to the various regulations of the allied neutral countries, without exceeding them in the slightest. Our government's permission for the legitimate commercial transport of various belligerent countries to freely pass through our country's territorial sea is fully in line with the generally accepted regulations. On the 12th of last month, the British government signed an agreement with our country, stipulating that our country's goods, including contraband, could still be sold and transported to Germany as usual. Now, Britain and France want to use force to stop this kind of transport, which is really beyond our country's expectations. In short, our country cannot accept the laying of mines by the belligerent countries in our country's territorial sea. Therefore, our government has to demand the removal of these mines and British warships, and reserves the right to take various appropriate measures to deal with them (Havas News Agency, 8th).</p>
<p>Oslo – Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht said in the Parliament last night that Norway's neutrality has been seriously violated today. He believed that the people of all neutral countries would be shocked when they heard this. The Allied nations' actions were right or wrong, and there was a public opinion on them. He did not need to criticize them harshly. He would now submit the Allied nations' documents to the Parliament, and the government would discuss with the Parliament the steps that Norway should take to safeguard its rights. Koht then reported on the notes delivered by Britain and France to Norway and Sweden on April 5, stating that the Allied governments understood the difficult position of the Norwegian and Swedish governments due to German threats and oppression, but had to come to a conclusion that in the current circumstances, the Norwegian and Swedish governments could not be regarded as free bodies in all circumstances. Germany could obtain important military supplies from Norway and Sweden. What was beneficial to Germany was harmful to the Allied nations. As things stood, the Allied governments could no longer tolerate it. Therefore, they felt that the time had come to clearly announce to the Norwegian and Swedish governments that the Allied governments would maintain certain necessary rights and defend these rights in various ways that they considered necessary. If the Norwegian and Swedish governments refused to give the Allied nations the commercial and shipping facilities that they considered necessary in wartime and that neutral countries could reasonably give, then the Allied governments would have to take appropriate steps to safeguard their interests. Although the Allied nations were fighting for themselves, they were also fighting for weak countries and could not allow their war effort to be hindered by the benefits that Germany obtained from Norway and Sweden. Therefore, the Allied nations reserved the right to take any steps they deemed necessary to prevent Germany from obtaining raw material supplies or conveniences from these two countries that were beneficial to Germany during the war and harmful to the Allied nations. The Allied nations' notes were worded like this. He then stated to the British and French ministers that the Allied nations had no reason to accuse the Norwegian government of being unfree and not independent. He believed that it was unfair to address the Norwegian government in this way. The Norwegian government had recently concluded agreements on commerce and shipping, and there was no reason to indicate that the Norwegian government did not respect these agreements. However, other than this, he could not and did not want to give an immediate reply, and the note did not mention the methods under consideration. He submitted the note to the government on Saturday and Sunday and made a phone call to the Swedish Foreign Minister to discuss and agree on drafting a reply according to this plan, but before the reply was issued, there was a development that created a completely new situation. Koht said after reporting on the Allied nations' note delivered to Norway yesterday, "I do not intend to say much about the meaning contained in the note. The Allied nations' actions of aggression were only because they had the power to do so. The Allied nations are now conducting the war within Norway's territorial sea, thinking that doing so will make it easier to win." Parliament Speaker Hambro spoke, expressing the hope that the government could eliminate the difficulties and that the inherent friendship would not be jeopardized too much. The Parliament unanimously agreed with Foreign Minister Koht's remarks (Reuters News Agency, 9th).</p>

It is said that when Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech in Ovieto the day before yesterday, he declared that Italy was actively preparing in all aspects to cope with any changes in the situation. Roman political figures pointed out that the British and French measures, no matter how they were interpreted, were acts of violating international law, and their purpose was to make neutral countries join the Allied countries in the war (Haitong News Agency, 9th).</p>

<h3 id="e18">National Council of Political Participation: Held Its Eighth Meeting Yesterday; Approved Reports on Internal and External Affairs and Their Key Resolutions; Elected Resident Committee Members for the Recess of the Current Assembly <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Fifth National Council of Political Participation held its eighth meeting at 3 PM today, continuing discussions on government reports reviewed by various review committees, government proposals, and council members' motions. It also elected resident committee members for the recess of the current assembly. Present were Speaker Chiang Kai-shek, Vice Speaker Zhang Boling, Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, Secretary Lei Zhen, Gu Xiwu, and council member Li Yongxin, totaling 123 individuals. Over ten heads of various agencies, including Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, and Ye Chucang, were also present. The meeting commenced at 3 PM, chaired by Speaker Chiang. After formal proceedings, each item was discussed. After a break, Speaker Chiang, due to pressing official matters, was replaced by Vice Speaker Zhang as chair. The council approved six reports on military affairs, foreign affairs, internal affairs, finance, economy, and transportation, along with numerous important motions. The key resolutions regarding the reports on foreign affairs, internal affairs, and transportation, as well as the important motions, are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A. (1) Key resolutions regarding the foreign affairs report are as follows: (1) China's resistance war aims for the nation's and people's free survival, and the independence and integrity of territorial sovereignty. This established national policy shall never change. All proposals for resolving Sino-Japanese relations after the (September 18th) Incident cannot be universally applied due to the outbreak of war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should instruct envoys abroad to clarify this intent whenever possible. (2) Since the establishment of the puppet regime, our foreign affairs authorities have issued solemn statements, and many friendly nations have expressed their disdain. However, the Japanese puppet regime's schemes to undermine our nation know no bounds. The foreign affairs authorities should pay special attention and, when necessary, make more resolute and serious statements to correct international perceptions and promote national integrity. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should seek to conduct treaty negotiations with Thailand to improve Sino-Thai relations and effectively protect overseas Chinese in Thailand. (4) Regarding foreign affairs administration, now that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expanded its organization, it should strive to enrich its work and enhance its effectiveness. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should strive for more systematic research on the situations in various countries to facilitate accurate judgments on the international situation, especially regarding the review of enemy intelligence. Greater attention should be paid to legal interpretation in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Key resolutions regarding the internal affairs report are as follows: (1) The improvement of personnel administration, encompassing assessment, continuation, rewards, and punishments, is of utmost importance. Thorough assessment is essential for effective supervision, and clear rewards and punishments are essential for incentivizing performance. The assessment, rewards, and punishments of administrative personnel at all levels of local government should be universally applied to ensure fairness. Past assessments have not extended to senior administrative personnel at the local level. In the future, the principle of starting punishment from the top and bestowing rewards on the lower levels should be followed, making assessment of senior officials essential. (2) Training for county-level cadres is an effective method for enhancing administrative efficiency and reforming local politics. In the future, the implementation of training should emphasize both spirit and technique. "Spirit" refers to the spirit of practical service, and "technique" refers to the techniques for solving problems encountered in practical service. (3) The promulgation of the new county system is an important measure for improving local administration and self-governance organizations in our country in recent years, and it is also a fundamental task for implementing constitutional government. The council members are extremely concerned and hope that the government will report to the council in detail on the recent implementation and any difficulties encountered. (4) Baojia (neighborhood watch) and household registration are important tasks for internal affairs. The government is requested to earnestly rectify Baojia and thoroughly investigate household registration to lay the foundation for self-governance. It is also necessary to strengthen local security and enhance the people's self-defense capabilities to benefit the future of the resistance war. (5) The deadline for banning opium is approaching. It is hoped that the government, without fear of difficulty, will use its greatest determination to ban cultivation, transportation, sale, storage, and smoking within the specified time limit to eliminate years of harm.</p>
<p>(3) Key resolutions regarding the transportation report are as follows: (1) Transportation is extremely important during the resistance war. It is hoped that the government, based on the principle of unified management, will continue to make reasonable adjustments to the transportation organization. (2) Efforts should be made to effectively link transportation in various provinces to achieve cooperation. (3) Drivers frequently cause accidents, and discipline is lax, making it necessary to intensify rectification. In the future, in addition to paying attention to training, attention should also be paid to strict management and the execution of discipline. (4) The testing of coal-fueled vehicles has proven effective and should be promoted as much as possible. If there are difficulties in application, they should be researched and resolved with all efforts to achieve universal implementation. (5) In the past six months, postal remittances have been effective in attracting remittances from overseas Chinese and promoting savings deposits, but the amount is still considered small. Greater efforts should be made in the future to achieve significant results. (6) The management of navigation on the Sichuan River and the operation of highway passenger vehicles should be actively improved in the future to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>B. Important motions are as follows: (1) The government is actively promoting the production of rear area materials. How should funds and operational capabilities be concentrated to achieve significant results? The key resolution is as follows: The purpose of this motion is to encourage people to engage in production undertakings, which is commendable. The various regulations mentioned in the motion have been promulgated for a long time, and the government's intention to encourage production undertakings is evident. To further expand upon this, efforts should be made in the following areas: 1. The government must formulate various practical and feasible enterprise plans for people to choose to invest in. 2. The government must promulgate a reliable guarantee method, increasing the interest rates on existing industrial interest protection and subsidy regulations, and reducing excessive profit taxes on industrial and mining enterprises with greater risk, to further achieve universal effectiveness. Especially in these extraordinary times, unexpected losses are constantly feared. All mines and factories should be allowed to insure against land war disasters as a priority. 3. Regarding technology, in this extraordinary period, technical personnel are often in greater demand than supply and are not easy to recruit. The government should be responsible for assisting and training to enable factories to recruit more personnel. 4. Establish a design organization to handle design and investigation work on behalf of industrial, commercial, and mining enterprises, thereby encouraging them. 5. Transfer government-run enterprises that have achieved success, except those that should remain state-owned, to society and allow the people to take over their operation. 6. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs should designate reliable guarantees and issue industrial bonds to absorb idle funds for exclusive storage and use in industrial and mining undertakings. 7. The government should pay close attention to the raw materials, machinery, tools, and fuel required by private industrial and mining enterprises at all times and provide them with convenience to ensure a continuous supply for their maintenance.</p>
<p>(2) The government motion (Draft Outline for a Five-Year National Education Implementation Plan) was resolved and passed as follows: (1) The funds required for this plan are enormous. It is hoped that the government will consider the people's ability to bear the burden when raising funds and will not hinder the needs of the resistance war. (2) The implementation of this plan is complex. It is hoped that the government will plan carefully and implement it step by step. (3) Teacher training should be prepared before starting national schools. (4) Teachers should first be recruited from existing primary school teachers, two per school, and should be divided into teachers and substitute teachers according to their educational level. (5) When the Baojia head serves concurrently as the school principal, he must possess the legal qualifications of a primary school principal. (6) The education funds of each county and city, in addition to the central and provincial subsidies and the original funds, should be统筹handled by the province and city. (7) When the central government subsidizes local funds, it should provide more subsidies to poor provinces. (3) Council member Jiang Hengyuan and 23 others proposed to expedite the popularization of national education. It is requested that the central government allocate substantial funds and organize a committee to plan its affairs to complete the five-year implementation plan. The resolution was amended and passed. (4) Council member Jiang Hengyuan and 23 others proposed to aid in the popularization of national education and specially drafted measures for a school establishment and production movement. It is submitted for public resolution. The resolution was amended and passed and submitted to the government for adoption and implementation. (5) Council member Chen Qiye and 23 others proposed to establish a Central Institute of National Studies to promote our country's inherent culture and promote national rejuvenation. The resolution was: The purpose of this motion is to promote national studies, which is commendable. It is submitted to the government for reference. (9th dispatch)</p>

The German planes were all single-engine Type 109s. One was shot down near Polaimoselle, within 12 miles of the Maginot Line, and its wreckage has been found. Another German aircraft was visibly damaged and seen crashing within the Allied lines, but its wreckage has not been located. It has been observed that in recent air battles, the Germans have been experimenting with their twin-engine cannon-equipped Messerschmitt 110s. The return to using the smaller Messerschmitt 109s suggests the Type 110 aircraft suffered heavy losses. In the current stage of the war, German Aviation Minister Goering is willing to sacrifice large quantities of the numerous Type 109s rather than lose the fewer and harder-to-replace Type 110 heavy aircraft. This shift may be temporary, but if it continues, what will the elite squadrons of Type 110 aircraft think? The specific purpose of deploying these aircraft to the Western Front was to create excitement and boost the morale of other German fighter squadrons, which are being depleted. The Germans undoubtedly hoped this squadron would intimidate British single-engine Hurricane pilots and French fighter pilots, but if so, their expectations have been thwarted.

<h3 id="e47">Australia Intensifies National Defense Preparations <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Walpole – Australian Prime Minister Menzies delivered a speech on the fourth, addressing Australia's military efforts. He stated that Australia's national defense is not limited to Australia itself. If the British army is defeated in Europe, Australia will be in a dangerous situation, just as if enemy troops landed in Australia. If Britain and France are defeated, everything will be lost. Therefore, Australia's sending troops overseas is for the sake of defending Australia itself. The Military Cabinet recently decided to form a corps and is considering the status of the national defense forces. By June of this year, Australia will have 307,500 soldiers who have received three to four months of training, which will form a large defense force. Australia will continue to conscript one or two more batches of people for training, the number depending on temporary needs. These recruits will reside in camps for ten weeks of training. The situation today is different from that during the last war. Last time, it was only necessary to concentrate on recruiting and sending troops overseas to participate in the war. Today, it is necessary to consider both internal defense and external warfare. Before the war, the internal defense force consisted of 4,000 people. Now, it is necessary to have a standing force of 12,000 people. In addition to participating in the Imperial air defense plan, Australia's domestic air defense personnel will increase from 2,800 a year ago to 5,400. The navy will increase from 5,400 to 11,600 people. Australia can be proud of its use of national manpower, as industry also requires a great deal of manpower in addition to the military. In 1918, Australia had 2,500 workers manufacturing munitions. According to the current program, the Ministry of Supply will employ 17,000 people by June 1942, and there will be tens of thousands more building aircraft and defense projects.

<h3 id="e49">Breaches on the Puyang and Other Rivers; Flooding Disaster in Southern Hebei; Fertile Fields of the Past Now a Watery Land; Millions of Victims, Losses of 300 Million <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: The area south of Taishan Mountain, east of the Taihang Mountains, and south of the Cangshi Road in southern Hebei Province is known as Southern Hebei. It is a vast plain with fertile fields and abundant products. Not long after the incident, the area fell into enemy hands.</p>
<p>Victims of Disaster Suffer Again from Floods</p>
<p>Last spring, Southern Hebei lacked rainfall, and autumn planting was delayed, resulting in signs of drought. However, starting on July 9, there were three days of heavy rain, and mountain torrents erupted. Consequently, the rivers of Southern Hebei reversed their past drought conditions, and accumulated water was difficult to discharge for a time. The water levels of the Puyang River, the 　 River, and the Grand Canal rose seven or eight feet to more than ten feet in a single day. The danger of flooding was imminent. The reasons for this unprecedented disaster of flooding, floating fields and houses, and displaced people are not simple. In this flood, all the rivers in Southern Hebei had breaches, with more than twenty in the Puyang River and North Grand Canal area being the most severe. Currently, 51 counties and 3 cities out of the 56 counties and cities in Southern Hebei have been turned into a watery land. The area affected totals 5,924,823 acres. The depth of the water ranges from one or two feet to thirty feet, and the width ranges from one or two rods to sixty li. Large boats can travel on the land. The total number of victims is three million, and the total property loss is as high as 300 million yuan. The heartbreaking and tragic disaster is evident.</p>
<p>Selling Children, Refugees on the Roads</p>
<p>Escaping for one's life and selling one's own flesh and blood are the only two options for the disaster victims at this time. Large numbers of refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, men and women carrying baskets and pushing carts, are fleeing outwards. According to investigations, two-thirds of the population of Qinghe County has fled. In Zhanghou Village, Hengshui County, only five households remain out of more than fifty households. In order to save their own lives and prolong the lives of their beloved children, they had no choice but to painfully sell their own children to others. Even worse, some were unable to sell their children and abandoned them by the roadside, enduring the pain and allowing their children to cry until they died. There is no greater human tragedy than this. Secondly, when it comes to the problem of food, due to a lack of grain, prices have risen. Families with grain dare not sell it, so the price of grain on the market continues to rise, and the amount of grain decreases. Currently, tree roots, bark, melon vines, bean stalks, and sweet potato stems and leaves have become food. The human hell is truly unbearable.</p>

The key points for implementation are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 of the National Education Implementation Outline. 2. For the purpose of popularizing national education, each bao shall establish a national school, referred to as a "Bao National School." 3. The principle is to establish one national school per bao. If the population of the bao is dense and the area is less than four square li, or if the natural unit of a village or street cannot be separated, two or three baos may jointly establish one school, called the "Joint National School of XX Baos." If the area of the bao is too vast and the villages are sparsely populated, the national school may set up classes in various villages or implement itinerant teaching. Baos that have already established central schools and are within three li of the central school will not establish separate national schools. Children and adults who should be in school should attend the elementary school and adult education department of the central school. 4. The national school should be located in the location of the bao office. The school building must be adjacent to and share facilities with the bao office in principle. 5. The national school shall establish an elementary school department and an adult education department. The elementary school department shall be organized in accordance with the elementary school system, from the first to the fourth grade, with at least four grades. Children of school age from six to twelve years old within the bao shall be admitted and given four, two, or one year of elementary school education. Kindergartens or kindergarten classes may also be attached. The adult education department shall set up elementary adult classes and elementary women's classes, at least one class each. In accordance with the revised regulations on adult schools, out-of-school adults from fifteen to thirty-five years old shall be admitted first and given elementary remedial education. Advanced adult classes and women's classes may also be established at the discretion of the school to admit students who have graduated from elementary adult or women's classes and provide them with advanced remedial education. The elementary school department and the adult education department may, depending on the actual situation, admit children over twelve years of age but under fifteen years of age who have dropped out of school and provide them with education. 6. The elementary school department of the national school shall organize classes according to the age and intelligence of the children when they enroll. The number of students per class shall be 50. Depending on local conditions, a single-grade system or a combined single-grade system may be used. The adult education department may divide classes according to occupation and gender. The number of students per class shall be 50. 7. The elementary school department of the national school shall hold classes during the day. The curriculum and teaching hours shall be in accordance with the elementary school curriculum standards and short-term elementary school curriculum standards. The adult education department shall choose appropriate times for classes according to the season. The curriculum and teaching hours shall be in accordance with the revised regulations on adult schools. 8. The expenses of the national school shall be raised by the bao itself in principle. The methods for raising funds shall be determined separately. 9. The elementary school department of the national school shall not charge tuition. The necessary student supplies may be sold to children at low prices by the school in conjunction with local cooperative organizations. The adult education department shall not charge fees. The textbooks used shall be requested by the school from the county and city governments. 10. The national school shall have one principal who shall be responsible for all school affairs. In economically and educationally developed areas, the county government shall select qualified personnel who meet the qualifications prescribed in Article 64 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations or who have passed the examination to be full-time principals. In areas where talent and economy are difficult, the principal may temporarily serve concurrently as the bao chief or deputy bao chief. The bao chief or deputy bao chief who has the qualifications of an elementary school principal may also concurrently serve as the principal. 11. When the national school principal concurrently serves as the bao chief, a full-time teacher shall be added to serve concurrently as the director of instruction within the possible range to assist the principal in handling school affairs. 12. The teachers of the national school shall be selected by the principal from those who have the qualifications prescribed in Article 62 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations and who have passed the examination. In areas where talent and economy are difficult, substitute teachers may be hired in accordance with the provisions of Article 66 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations. 13. Teachers of the national school may concurrently handle bao office affairs outside of teaching work hours. 14. The national school shall, in consideration of local needs, organize various social education programs in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Revised Adult School Regulations. 15. The national school shall report the organization, finances, equipment, teacher roster, list of enrolled children, list of enrolled adults, etc., to the township (town) government within one month after the start of each semester and report to the competent educational administrative agency for record. 16. The finances, organization, training and education, equipment, achievement assessment, teachers, etc., of the national school shall be governed by the provisions of the Revised Elementary School Curriculum and the Revised Adult School Regulations, except as provided in the various articles of these regulations.</p>

<p>The Silver Money Industry Basketball League, the Silver Group Champion China Storage, and the Silver Group Champion Transportation, played the final championship game at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA Fitness Center last night. The four seats were full, and the event was very grand. The two teams were evenly matched, and the game was exceptionally tense. Transportation scored the first point with a free throw by Yu Dehai and led throughout the first half. The first half ended with Transportation holding an absolute advantage of 18 to 11. After the break, China Storage fought hard to challenge Transportation. The game fluctuated and became unstable. With one minute remaining in the final game, the score was tied 27-27. In the last 23 seconds, Qu Qiaonan of China Storage made a shot that went in. China Storage then won this most valuable point, reversed the defeat and won the overall championship of the Silver Money Cup this year. In the name-place battle between China Bank A and Jincheng, Hsing recently recovered its strength and showed great skill last night, defeating Jincheng 45-22 and ranking third. Unfortunately, due to a slight difference in the final settlement, he regretted it for life. Otherwise, the championship seat may have become another situation. The battle results are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e62">Finance: European War Escalates; US Dollar Suddenly Approaches 6 Yuan Mark; HSBC Still Maintains British Gold <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates, after several days of fluctuation, suddenly experienced turbulence yesterday, with a surprisingly tight underlying trend. The expansion of the European situation has become a reality, causing anxiety. The market generally expected the US dollar to decline. Initially, the US dollar exchange rate fell by 0.0275, opening with a weak British pound and soft US dollar at 0.0625, reaching 6.09375 yuan. Speculators then entered, but US banks maintained a steady supply, and the market price was not significantly affected. After 10:30 AM, US banks gradually reduced their supply, benefiting foreign banks who entered the market to collect. The situation became tight. The afternoon saw increased speculative buying due to news reports that Germany had invaded Denmark and Norway had declared war on Germany. The disturbances in Europe were beyond repair. People considered a continued decline in exchange rates to be inevitable in the future. At that time, Chinese merchants frantically bought, and the supply could not meet the demand. The US dollar exchange rate broke through the 6 yuan mark, closing at 5.96875 yuan. The British gold price remained at 4 pence 0.125 (equivalent to a US-British exchange rate of 3.4725 yuan). This was due to the strong support of HSBC. The futures market for the US dollar was extremely tight, while the British gold price showed a slight decline. The gap between the futures and spot markets widened. It is said that the future foreign exchange situation will depend on whether the US-British exchange rate can break through 3.5 yuan (because there was a secret agreement between the US and Britain for a minimum exchange rate of 3.5 yuan before the outbreak of the European war). If it is difficult to break through, it will trigger a flurry of intervention.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Banks Buy US Dollars and Sell British Pounds</p>
<p>In the morning, London's large and small contracts were flat, New York's silver price remained at half, and London's gold price was stable. The exchange rates of British pound against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0275 against the British pound, was unchanged against the Shanghai currency, and fell slightly by 0.015 against the French currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning with British gold at 4 pence 0.125 and the US dollar at 6.09375 yuan, with the British currency flat and the US dollar tighter by 0.0625 compared to the previous close due to the decline in the exchange rate. Although speculators came to buy forward US dollars after the opening, US commercial banks still had a supply at that time, so the market situation was stable. This included trading the current month's US dollar at 6.0625 and 0.03125, and the May US dollar at 5.875 yuan. HSBC's listed price was unchanged. The balanced tax on silver was also unchanged. Afterwards, US banks sold US dollars and bought British pounds, hedging the May exchange rate at 3.525 yuan. At the same time, Hong Kong banks sold US dollars and bought British pounds, hedging the spot exchange rate at 3.5425 yuan. The situation was calm. After 10:30 AM, beneficial parties suddenly came to buy, and speculators resumed their activities, and US banks' willingness to supply weakened, so the market situation became tighter and softer. This included beneficial parties absorbing the current month's US dollars from other banks at 6.03125 yuan, and speculators buying May US dollars from foreign banks at 5.84375 yuan. At that time, the spot US dollar had shrunk to 6.0625 yuan, and the futures were even softer. At one point, the May US dollar could be settled at only 5.8125 yuan. However, foreign banks' willingness to sell forward contracts soon became stronger, and the situation gradually stabilized. By the close, the spot British gold price remained at 4 pence 0.125 and the US dollar at 6.0625 yuan, the current month's price at 4 pence 0.078125 and 6 yuan, and the May price at 3 pence 984375 and 5.84375 yuan, with the British currency flat and the US dollar tighter by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Futures Buying Trend Even Stronger</p>
<p>The post-market initially opened with spot and futures being flat, but speculators came to buy again, settling the current month's US dollar from foreign banks at only 5.96875 yuan. At that time, the spot market was still stable. Around 3:00 PM, news suddenly came that the European war had expanded, so the people of this city were pessimistic about the exchange rate. The buying trend in the futures US dollar became even stronger, and Chinese banks also became active, and foreign banks' willingness to supply was weak. Spot and futures prices became tighter and softer step by step. Trading opened with the current month's US dollar at 5.9375 to 875 yuan, and the May US dollar at 5.78125 to 71875 yuan. By the close, the spot US dollar was only at 5.96875 yuan, but the British gold price remained firmly at 4 pence 0.125. The current month's British gold price was at 4 pence 0.0625, the US dollar at 5.875 yuan, the May British gold price at 3 pence 96875 yuan, and the US dollar at 5.6875 yuan. As a result, the spot British currency was flat and the US dollar tighter by 0.1875 compared to the previous day. The current month's British currency shrunk by 0.015625 and the US dollar softened by 0.21875. The May British currency was tighter by 0.015625 and the US dollar was higher by 0.15.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Tightens</p>

<h3 id="e63">Gold Reaches New High Price: Sees Peak of 5,660 Yuan <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market experienced a sudden surge after six days of decline, reaching 5,660 yuan, breaking the previous high record of 5,590 yuan on March 31 and creating an unprecedented peak price. The reasons were the tightening of the exchange market and the deteriorating situation in Europe, with Germany invading Denmark and Norway declaring war on Germany, indicating an expansion of the war. The market was temporarily chaotic, and operators added to their holdings, leading to repeated high prices. The initial opening was 5,490 yuan, a significant increase of 93 yuan compared to the previous day, due to the reported contraction of the exchange rate and the softening of the US dollar. Subsequently, it was sold off by money changers, securities firms, and silver houses, falling slightly to a low of 5,455 yuan. However, after hearing that the foreign exchange was consistently tight around noon, buying interest gradually increased. Banks and silver houses took in large amounts, and gold and securities firms also increased their holdings, so it rose again to 5,540 yuan. In the afternoon, news from Europe spread, adding fuel to the fire, and buyers rushed to buy. Although there were not a few who took profits at high prices, there was ultimately a shortage of supply. The price jumped to the record high of 5,660 yuan. It was heard that gold and silver houses were the strongest buyers. The closing result was still 5,655 yuan, a surge of 258 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was brisk throughout the day, totaling about 5,000 taels. Jewelry stores immediately raised their gold prices by 25 yuan, creating a peak price of 570 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Jumps 258 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening for each tael (10 liang) saw the exchange rate contract, the US dollar tighten, and confidence rise. G-chips were heard calling for purchases, and the market opened at an increased price of 93 yuan. Securities firms entered the gold market at 5,490 yuan per ten taels. Subsequently, a certain money changer agreed to supply, and gold and securities firms and silver houses also sold off, and many retail investors shorted. Although money changers and silver houses successively bought for their own firms, the positions were still felt to be abundant, and they soon fell back slightly by 35 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to securities firms for 5,455 yuan. Then, the sellers gradually decreased, and a certain money changer's buying interest remained strong, rising again by more than 20 yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, the spot and futures US dollar exchange rates continued to be reported as tight and soft, so the buying trend was even stronger. Gold firms were searching to buy at increased prices, and securities firms were also switching from selling to buying, thus breaking through the 5,500 yuan mark. Money changers entered a total of 50 taels, actually at 5,525 yuan. However, at that time, floating longs took profits and sold off, briefly falling back to 5,505 yuan. But securities firms and money changers revived their buying interest, and a certain silver house came back to buy aggressively, leaping another 35 yuan. Gold firms entered 30 taels from silver houses for 5,540 yuan. Later, the silver house sold 50 taels to the gold firm for 5,535 yuan as the noon price. In the afternoon, the market was even stronger, jumping 25 yuan at the opening. Securities firms sold 20 taels to silver houses for 5,560 yuan. Later, the bullish securities firms slightly came to sell off again, falling back 10 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to money changers for 5,550 yuan. After this, money changers bought in, and at that time the exchange rate was reported to be soft, rising again by 30 yuan. For a long time, it fluctuated between 5,570 and 80 yuan. Unexpectedly, the rising trend started again around 3:00 PM. A certain silver house first came to release positions and bought aggressively, and the gold firms followed closely, and the buying trend expanded. And the exchange rate of foreign exchange continued to be reported as tight and soft. Although securities firms and money changers etc. came to sell off, they all took the opportunity to raise prices, soaring 70-80 yuan. Gold firms entered 50 taels from securities firms for 5,660 yuan. After entering, the buying trend slightly subsided, falling slightly by 5 yuan. Silver houses did 20 taels between each other, for 5,655 yuan as the closing price. As a result, it rose by 258 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 205 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold of the gold shops is several yuan higher according to the spot gold, and the buying price is reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises 25 Yuan Consecutively</p>
<p>At the beginning, the jewelry gold sold by the silver shops was still 545 yuan, but at 9:30, it was increased by 5 yuan, at 10:45, it was increased by another 5 yuan, at 12:05, it was increased by another 5 yuan, at 3:15 in the afternoon, it was increased by another 5 yuan, and at 4:00, it was increased by another 5 yuan. As a result, it was increased by a total of 25 yuan. The large peers changed to 570 yuan, and the new peers were similar to the previous price (the above is an unprecedented record since the market began). The buying price was reduced by around 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market suddenly experienced a surprising surge. British and American gold pounds followed the sudden and rapid advance of spot gold. British gold notes remained stable. American gold notes closely followed the rise of the US exchange rate, initially trading at 16.20 yuan, then gradually rising to 16.38 yuan, then slightly falling back to 16.278 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 16.40 yuan. In the afternoon, news spread that German troops had actually entered Danish territory, causing the European war to expand further. The price of British pounds was bound to continue to decline, leading to increased buying interest and continued price increases. The market rose to 16.68 yuan in the evening. Hong Kong notes remained stable and in demand, with market prices continuing to rise. French franc notes and Dutch, Annamite, Rupee, Canadian, and Philippine notes all rose in tandem. Japanese gold notes initially fell and then rose, eventually seeing a 5% increase, reaching 1.1325 yuan in the evening. Korean notes recovered, reaching 1.1115 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by 6 yuan each, American gold notes rise by 0.57 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.01 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.001 yuan, Dutch notes rise by 0.10 yuan, Annamite notes and Rupee and Canadian notes all rise by 0.05 yuan, Philippine notes rise by 0.15 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Exchange and Discount Rates Rise Again <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes suddenly rose, from around 62 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning to 63 yuan, and then to 65.5 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 4.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's overnight interest rate was unchanged at 0.20 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Securities: Political Instability: How Can Securities Alone Be Stable? <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot securities market saw a slight setback in the rising trend, but the foundation remained firm. In the afternoon, the spot prices for domestic varieties, excluding those drawn in the lottery, were only slightly lower by 0.5 yuan. The spot prices failed to rise immediately due to tight credit and restrictions on multiple parties. The situation in the city was unstable, and people were worried, so the trend was slightly discouraged. Gold was rising, the European war was expanding, and the future was full of changes, so public bonds would also be unstable. Yesterday's buyers were still mainly Xinfu and No. 20, who were the most enthusiastic. Lianhe No. 38 also bought consistently. Other buyers included No. 16, No. 41, Taifeng, Renchang, Shuntai, and Tongkang. Runyi, Yichang, Yuankang consistently sold. Lianyi, Shengda, Zhenkang, and Mada also sold, causing the spot prices to be slightly weak. As a result, Class C shares, excluding the lottery shares, were 0.7 yuan lower, and the rest were only about 0.1-0.2 yuan lower. The total number of transactions was more than 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 35 shares of China Bank were transacted at a price of 14 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the public stock market was robust, and a firm trend, unseen for a long time, was observed again yesterday. The market was even more active in the early afternoon. Although many people took profits, the buying interest was unusually strong, and all stocks were able to maintain their rising prices. Suddenly, news came that German troops had invaded Denmark, and the market was immediately affected. Sellers rushed to sell, and prices plummeted instantly. British Union shares opened at 42 yuan and fluctuated for a long time. The number of transactions was large. The closing price was 42.25 yuan for buying and 42.5 yuan for selling. China Reclamation shares saw a high price record of 20 yuan again yesterday. The situation was lively and enthusiastic, no different from the previous few days. 110,000 shares were traded, and the closing price was softer, with 19.2 yuan for buying and 19.4 yuan for selling. The trading volume of Yangtze Silver Company, Shanghai Silver Company, and Jardine shares was extremely large. They closed at lower prices of 17 yuan, 27.5 yuan, and 46.5 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Rubber shares were very active yesterday, and prices soared at one point, but the closing price also softened.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Monday) telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies' Far East stocks were stable today, with no increase or decrease in prices.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Sales Improve; Yarn Prices Soar <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Shuangma is close to the 1,200 yuan mark, and the market is rising again. The current yarn sales are smooth, and demand from Hong Kong is strong, greatly boosting confidence. Buying interest is very high, so the market is soaring, creating new high prices. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuangma has reached 1,198 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening for the current yarn was due to the contraction of the British and American exchange rates and the rise in gold, resulting in a strong buying interest. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma current yarn was 1,175 yuan, rising directly to 1,198 yuan. Profits were taken along the way, slightly reducing the price, but the active sales of current goods caused it to rise again. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,515 bales were traded. In addition to the 50 yuan increase in the spot price of 20-count Shuangma, the factory opened 550 bales of 20-count special Jincheng yarn at 1,130-1,135 yuan current price from the Yongnu Factory. 700 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,175, Peer 1,260</p>
<p>Fuzhou 10, Inland 80</p>
<p>Total 2,525</p>
<h3 id="e68">Cotton Also Rises by 3 Yuan <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton trading slightly improved due to the rising gold price and the contracting exchange rate, which boosted confidence. Market sentiment also rose by more than 3 yuan along with the yarn market. Some people believed that if the European war expanded and the overseas shipping was lacking, it would be good in the future. However, at present, the cotton arriving in Shanghai is huge. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left. For foreign cotton market prices, see the New York cotton market.</p>
<p>Mitlin 276.50 Fellow Entered 200 pieces</p>
<p>Also 268.00</p>
<p>Tongzhou Packaged 34.50 Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Tongzhou White Package 208.10 Also 70 bales</p>
<p>Also 208.50 Also 85 bales</p>
<p>Also 20.75 Also 250 bales</p>
<p>Pingguo Er 176.00 Also 500 pieces</p>
<p>Duli La 207.75 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Mitlin 270.00 Domestic and Foreign Entry 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another message regarding the foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market, which initially fell due to the selling of overseas cotton merchants, and subsequently rose due to the purchase of spot merchants and the purchase on the market by the same industry, ultimately closed at a price that was 5-6 decimals higher than the previous day. The Indian market situation was quite firm. Yesterday, the forecast rose again by 5 points. The Egyptian market rose by more than 10 British pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading was also active yesterday due to the brisk yarn sales of the Guangdong merchants, coupled with the rise of the overseas cotton market, and the news from overseas in the afternoon that the situation in Europe was tense and conflicts had occurred in Norway. The mentality of the local industry turned exciting again, and the current goods were vigorously searched in the market, but there was no supply to meet the demand. The general opinion is that both yarn and cotton will be high in the market. The prices of yesterday's cotton market converted to the factory price at an exchange rate of 6 yuan per US dollar are as follows:</p>
<p>20 count US Mitlin 290.70</p>
<p>Also, Also Lower Grade 280.50</p>
<p>30 count Also 306.75</p>

<p>Jielong Bank, Quan Zhou packed new Gardenia transported by the Xiangtai Wheel, 43 bags arrived in Shanghai, and all were contracted and distributed by Xin Kaihe Jiuxingli Longmao Bank. The supply of this medicine has been scarce for a long time, and the amount is limited, so the market has not yet opened, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Food: Local Rice Arrives, Slightly Stronger; Rice Prices Frequently Reported to Be Falling <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Domestic sources are gradually becoming clearer, and arrivals are increasing day by day. Yesterday, the morning saw even more severe price drops than before. Both domestic and foreign rice experienced a sudden plunge of more than 2 yuan. By the noon market, activity had picked up and prices rebounded. As a result, the final decline was only about half a yuan. The first domestic rice merchants that listed the samples for the market were even more crowded. South Port offered early and late rice varieties, continuing to sell cheaply, opening at only 37-38 yuan. The general Zhongguan Fenjing variety from Jiangsu and Tongzhou also followed suit, falling below the limit price, selling at 39 yuan. It was heard that in the black market, only some high-end goods and special orders were sold. Special Changbang Jing was sold for only 42 yuan, the mid-range variety for 41 yuan, Kun Jing for 41.5 yuan and 40 yuan, Qingsi Te Yuan rice for 41 yuan, and then dropped to 40 yuan for retail. Jiangbei Jian was around 37-38 yuan. The Hongkou Dachang Company imported more than 5,000 bags of Jing and glutinous rice, causing the sentiment to unanimously decline, creating a sharp drop. The most miserable was the glutinous rice, as the previous bottom price was already cheap, and now it continues to depreciate, to be sold alongside broken rice. At the lowest, high-quality goods were sold for only 34.5 yuan, and the lower grades were only 33-34 yuan, and even 32.78 yuan. This is because the sales of wine are stagnant, and relying solely on pastries etc. is ultimately limited.</p>
<p>Foreign rice was suddenly affected by a sharp drop. No. 1 Saigon fell to 40 yuan and 39 yuan in the central market, No. 2 to 36.5 yuan and 36 yuan, Huojiao to 38.5 yuan and 37.8 yuan, Xiaojiao to 35.2 yuan and 35 yuan, mixed broken to 31.9 yuan, and rice gruel to 27 yuan. After this low price, it was able to attract searches from inland rural customers and replenishment from shops. The situation in the noon market turned tight, and all prices rose again by 1.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was 40.05 yuan, Chen No. 2 was 38 yuan and 37.5 yuan, Huojiao was 39.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 37.5 yuan, Xiaojiao was 36.8 yuan and 36.5 yuan, mixed broken was 33.2 yuan and 32.8 yuan, rice gruel was 28.5 yuan and 28 yuan, and Tokyo broken was 37.5 yuan and 37 yuan. The market was still weak, the foundation was unstable, and one move immediately led to relaxation. By the time of the close, the market for each product had become weak again.</p>
<p>More than 6,000 bags of foreign rice arrived again, transported from Haiphong by the Yihua Foreign Company's Taisheng Wheel with 5,062 bags, and 1,320 bags transported from Hong Kong.

<p>Flour continued to be weak yesterday, as sales in this street remained normal after the decline of the base price. The Japanese ordered export licenses for flour, and flour exports were invisibly hindered. The price of rice plummeted, and the old Chepai goods only opened at 14.34 yuan, and the price of the warship warehouse list was only 13 yuan. The price of flour in Changshu and inland areas was also invisibly lower. After the No. 2 flour mill's prices were changed to 13.5 yuan, the customer prices could also be lowered by 0.3-0.4 yuan, but in reality there were almost no new transactions.</p>
<p>Wheat was also sluggish yesterday, as it was heard that a total of 5-6 ships of foreign wheat contracted by each factory will arrive in this month. Although Chinese factories are purchasing, they are all choosing the cheapest ones. It was heard that Changshu wheat could no longer stand at the 23 yuan mark, and the prices of medium-grade goods were even cheaper. The price of Wuhu Zhongguan wheat was only 22.34 yuan, and the price of the wet medium-grade goods was only 20.05 yuan. About 1,000+ bags of sales.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Scarcity of Soybean Development <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market conditions have remained externally strong but internally weak. In general, the position is ample, making it difficult to stimulate sentiment. Although there was a period of tightness, it softened in an instant. Yesterday, the market saw inquiries from oil mills and Xiamenese traders, but with only ordinary demand, the overall situation remained loose.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Piece Goods - Cloth Prices Rise Directly - Hoarding Becomes More Common <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Due to the expansion of the European war and the sharp rise in gold prices, the concept of hoarding both within and outside the industry has become increasingly prevalent. In addition, customer sales remain strong, so cloth prices are rising steadily. The morning market rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day. The afternoon situation was even tighter, with prices rising by about 5 jiao per bolt. Da Peng, Fugui, fine cloth twill, and Lun Chang Ewo goods were the most sought after. Spot goods and grey cloth for April and May delivery totaling more than 100,000 bolts were traded in this street. There were also more than two hundred bolts of bleached cloth, fine cloth, foreign yarn, and colored cloth. Traders from Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces also made purchases. However, due to the drastic changes in cloth prices in the Shanghai market, both buyers and fellow traders held a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sluggish sales volume. 270 bolts of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 10th.</p>

<p>New York Stocks</p>
<p>New York Telegraph on the 8th: Today's stock market saw steel stocks turn uneven after steel mill operations were reduced. Automobile stocks took the lead. Oil stocks gradually attracted attention because reports indicated that the industry's profits were much larger than last year. Otherwise, there were no important news.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>New York Telegraph on the 8th: The demand for physical rubber remains good, and incoming shipments are expensive. This is the characteristic of today's market amidst silence. The earlier gains were reduced by a large trader who exerted pressure in the afternoon. The total amount of rubber imported from outside Malaya in March was 17,565 tons, compared to 16,059 tons last month.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Eye-Catching Domestic and Foreign News: Municipal Council Elections Commence This Morning – Voting Until 3 PM Tomorrow – Increased British and American Votes Suggest Promising Victory <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council election, entering its decisive phase over these two days starting today, will hold voting sessions at the Wan Guoshang Tuan (Shanghai Volunteer Corps) drill hall on Fuzhou Road and the Hongkou Xiaocai Chang (Hongkou Small Vegetable Market), respectively, starting at 10 AM this morning. Given the large-scale activities undertaken by the British-American united front and the Japanese side in recent days, it is anticipated that over 9,500 taxpayers will participate in the voting. Regarding the respective strengths of the two sides, according to Mr. Judd, chairman of the American Election Committee, the number of British and American taxpayers has increased significantly. The Japanese side also claims that with 400-500 votes from third-country electors leaning towards the Japanese side, they can exceed 4,000 votes. As for the number of votes the British and American candidates may obtain, it is believed to be comparable to the Japanese side. This tense situation is unprecedented since the public concession began holding council elections. Even in 1936, when the Japanese first requested an increase in candidates, it was not comparable. Whether the administrative power of the concession will be guaranteed intact, whether the status quo can be maintained, or whether it will be controlled by the Japanese side, are all matters of great concern. Taxpayers must make a careful decision about which path to take. The list of British, American, and Japanese candidates is as follows: (1) Arlemann, (2) Canner, (3) Tashiro, (4) Hayle, (5) Hanawa Yutaro, (6) Cadiz, (7) Kuroda Keitaro, (8) Abbot Lick McDonald, (9) Renoir McDonald, (10) Mitchell, (11) Okamoto Kazuhira, (12) Okomoto Otsuji, (13) Powell, totaling thirteen individuals.</p>
<p>British and American Campaign: Meticulous Arrangements</p>
<p>In recent days, the British-American and Japanese Election Committees have made their utmost efforts to get every taxpayer to participate in the voting. Taxpayers who are unclear about voting matters can inquire with the election committees and receive assistance. Each election committee has hired a large number of cars to provide dedicated transportation, making it convenient for taxpayers to go to the polls. The British-American Election Committee also issued a large number of slogans yesterday, urging taxpayers to pay attention, stating: "Vote for five British candidates and two American candidates," "Do not allow Japanese candidates to obtain an absolute majority to change the status quo of the concession," "If you are unclear about voting procedures, the Election Committee can provide as much assistance as possible," "The public concession should be absolutely internationalized for the benefit of the public, but this requires your full support."</p>
<p>Universally Optimistic: Victory is Hopeful</p>
<p>The mentality of the general British taxpayer has greatly changed from the past. They had previously held a skeptical attitude, but since yesterday, they have become optimistic and firm, believing that the British side can secure victory. Therefore, predictions about the outcome of this election have become the goal of general predictions. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps added a prediction yesterday, saying that the results of this election would be roughly visible after the polls close at 3 PM tomorrow. Another opinion is that this matter may not be revealed until Friday morning. However, the British and American candidates seem to have an absolutely optimistic attitude about securing victory, as it was learned yesterday from reliable sources that British and American candidates can obtain at least 4,000 votes. A week ago, when the Japanese side put forward as many as five candidates, the Japanese side actually believed that their candidates could obtain at least 3,700 votes, which was enough to exceed the 3,500 votes obtained by the British and American side. Observing the situation where all parties are criticizing the Municipal Council daily, it seems to be favorable to the Japanese side. However, although the British and Americans and people from all walks of life have shown dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council, they all attach more importance to the existence of the Yangjingbang land charter and should still take those with the widest range of rights and interests in Shanghai as the standard. Based on this point of view, it is believed that they can definitely defeat the Japanese side, as the property owned by the Japanese in Shanghai is not comparable to that of the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Jewish Confusion: Short-Sighted Vision</p>
<p>In terms of publicity, the British and Americans paid particular attention to Jews and Russian expatriates, because their number of electoral votes, in addition to British, American, and Japanese votes, is more than any other expatriates, and has a significant impact. British and American propaganda organs have specially alerted the Jews, saying, "If the Japanese win, the Jews will be expelled from Shanghai. Given the anti-Jewish claims in Japan, this kind of event will be re-enacted in Shanghai, which is indeed possible." As far as the current situation is concerned, some Jewish refugees are indeed forced by power and deceived by sweet words, and will help the Japanese side at that time. However, there are also many who understand the great righteousness and know that if the Japanese win in this election, the rights and interests of the concession will gradually be monopolized by them. Some have politely refused, and some are ready to abstain.</p>
<p>Russians Understand Japan Thoroughly</p>
<p>Although there are only more than two hundred Russian taxpayers, they also have the potential to sway the overall situation, so the Japanese side has used great enticement, even if they cannot help the Japanese candidates, they have advised them to abstain and not support the British and Americans. However, according to reliable sources yesterday, although the Russians in this port have always been suspected of being pro-Japanese, only a small number are willing to vote for them in this election, and the majority have expressed their willingness to vote for the British and American candidates. Although the Japanese side publicized heavily a few days ago that they had received a response from the Russians, judging from the situation, this propaganda has obviously failed. According to a Russian expatriate living in the area south of the Suzhou River yesterday, the Russians are aware that the Russian propaganda seen on Avenue Joffre is done by the Japanese, and they have long understood the Japanese face. Taking the treatment of Russian expatriates in Harbin as an example, it is clear. According to reports, most of the Russian expatriates in Harbin have been expelled by the Japanese, and most of the areas where Russian expatriates live have also been seized by the Japanese. In addition, the situation in Dalian, Beiping, and Shenyang is also the same. Most of the Russians living in these three places have suffered tremendous losses under the slogan of "East Asian New Order" established by the Japanese, and have no place to stand, so they fled to Shanghai. They believe that Shanghai is the largest free world for Russian expatriates. Unexpectedly, not long after the Russian expatriates lived in Shanghai, the Japanese forces expanded again, and there was even the possibility of the Russian expatriates encountering the same fate as Harbin. Therefore, after much thought, the Russian expatriates decided not to let the Japanese win in this election and help them seize the administrative power of the Municipal Council, because they are all afraid of the past, such as the censorship of newspapers and the frequent disappearances of relatives and friends, which may be re-enacted in Shanghai. Therefore, what the Russian expatriates are worried about is actually different from other foreign expatriates. Other foreign expatriates are deeply afraid that if the Japanese gain power, the economy will suffer a fatal blow, while the Russian expatriates are afraid that their daily lives will not be stable.</p>
<p>Japanese Candidates Hold Tea Party</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly precarious situation in recent days, the Japanese side was very worried, so they came up with a whimsical idea. Candidate Hanawa Yutaro invited celebrities and diplomatic officials from various countries in Shanghai to a tea party at his residence on Rue Cardinal Fesch on the afternoon of the 8th, under the pretext of viewing cherry blossoms, hoping to get help.</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Scheduled for the 17th</p>
<p>The foreign taxpayer's annual meeting will also be held on the 17th of this month. The agenda is as follows: (1) Elect Mr. Mosso as the chairman of the meeting, (2) Elect Mr. Nasi as the secretary of the meeting, (3) The rules of procedure adopted at the previous meeting shall still apply to this meeting, (4) Nominate Mr. Klon as a real estate committee member for the following year, (5) Elect four hospital managers for the following year, (6) Report on the report and accounts up to December 31 of last year, (7) Support and pass the new budget proposal for 1940 submitted by the outgoing board of directors, (8) New rules of procedure recognized as valid and adopted by this meeting, shall remain valid until the next meeting during the valid period.</p>
<p>Chen Tingrui Supplements the Chinese Committee</p>
<p>The Chinese taxpayer's association of the public concession should elect five Chinese directors, five committee members, and one land committee member of the Municipal Council this year. In addition to the previous proposal of 51 representatives by the majority vote, it is still requested that Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and others continue to be re-elected. There is also one committee member who should be nominated. Yesterday, the former committee member Chen Tingrui Zuren was nominated and was immediately formally informed to the Municipal Council for verification.</p>

<p>In recent days, the situation in Zhabei along the concession has suddenly become tense. At each entrance and exit, such as the two bridges of Xin Zha and Wuzhen Road, the sentries of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps and the Chinese police are inspecting pedestrians and vehicles with extreme strictness. No matter male or female pedestrians passing by, they must be carefully inspected by Japanese soldiers. If they carry objects, the inspection is even stricter. When vehicles pass, passengers must get out of the vehicle one by one for inspection. If there is any suspicion, they will be taken to the headquarters for interrogation. On the concession side, on the west side of Hainan Road, at the intersection of Gansu Road facing west, from Rehe Road to the intersection of Xizang Road, British soldiers have thickened the original barbed wire mesh frame and raised it by five or six feet. The iron gate on the west side of the south bank of the Xin Zha Bridge has been closed for three days, so only the east side is currently open.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that the US Consul General in this port, Mr. Heile, visited the Japanese Consul General Miura yesterday morning (the 8th) and verbally protested about the disturbance of the wavelength of the US commercial radio station (call sign XMHA). Miura especially promised to "investigate this matter," but the date of the Japanese reply has not been stipulated. However, if the Japanese continue to disturb the wavelength, it is expected that the US Acting Consul General Bertolik will file a written protest to the Japanese Consul General.

<p>The English-language China Press reports that the French Concession Municipal Council has promulgated precise standards and regulations for the measuring and weighing instruments used in stores, controlling measurement and curbing illegal profiteering by food vendors, which is another step forward. According to the regulations in the Municipal Council Gazette, no one may manufacture, sell, or repair measuring instruments in the French Concession without a special license. All sellers and repairers must have a mark registered with the Municipal Council on each instrument, and the number of sales or repairs must be recorded. Shops or workshops that have not obtained the permission of the Municipal Council are not allowed to sell or repair weighing instruments, and must purchase accurate instruments approved by the Municipal Council to verify whether the weighing instruments they manufacture are accurate. The standard unit of length adopted in the French Concession is the meter, the unit of capacity is the liter, and the unit of weight is the kilogram. As for the weighing instruments calculated in pounds, feet, and gallons used in the UK, they can also be used if they are marked with equivalent calculations in kilograms, meters, and liters.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many railway employees have bravely resisted Japan and sacrificed themselves for the country, and a few have willingly surrendered to the enemy. After the Ministry of Communications formulated the "Temporary Reward and Punishment Measures for Railway Employees in Occupied Areas," it specially instructed the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ningbo Railway Special Party Department and other levels of Party departments to follow and conduct investigations on their personnel for verification. The original text reads: "Since the outbreak of the war, the railway employees under this road have been outraged and organized groups in the occupied areas to resist Japan at the risk of their lives, resulting in death. Their perseverance and determination to die for righteousness are commendable. Even those who temporarily stumbled and were trapped in false rebellion and forced to follow the Japanese often seized the opportunity to extricate themselves and abandon rebellion for righteousness, and their aspirations are also commendable. If rewards and condolences are not distinguished, how can loyalty and integrity be encouraged? Or a few of the traitors who were willing to surrender to the enemy and remained unrepentant, the country has permanent punishment, and the crime is unforgivable. It is also necessary to enforce the law strictly to show Jiong's warning. This special regulation of five 'Temporary Reward and Punishment Measures for Railway Employees in Occupied Areas' is used to highlight the performance. All our employees should encourage each other. (1) Those who participate in the Anti-Japanese War work in the occupied area, after being restored, with the certificate of the Party and Military Administration Office in the war zone, will be allowed to return to their original position, and those with special achievements may be promoted as appropriate. (2) Those who died or injured in the occupied area due to participating in the Anti-Japanese War work, after being restored, with the certificate of the Party and Military Administration Office in the war zone, the original service unit will check and settle the pension in accordance with the regulations on pension. (3) Those who are sent by the Party and Military Administration Office of the war zone to the occupied area to work under the Japanese puppet organization, after being certified, the reward and pension will be the same as the previous two items. (4) Employees who work for the Japanese puppet organization should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances after being restored. (5) Employees who have worked for the Japanese puppet organization, after repenting and surrendering themselves, or performing meritorious service while serving their sentences, with the certificate of the Party and Military Administration Office in the war zone, will be allowed to return to their positions after being restored, but may be downgraded and have their salaries reduced as appropriate."</p>

<p>The residents of West Shanghai are becoming increasingly poor, so the pawn industry has developed abnormally, with no less than 40 shops. There is no fixed capital, the redemption period is only one or two months, and the interest is extremely high.

Therefore, each pawnshop has posted notices in recent days, saying, "Customers must come to redeem their pawns before the 13th of this month, otherwise they will be deemed abandoned." The general poor people are unable to prepare funds for redemption on a temporary basis, and are all extremely anxious.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Municipal Council President Facklering and Japanese Consul General Miura signed a basic agreement on March 1 regarding the return of full management of the Police Department in the public concession north of the Suzhou River. Yesterday morning (the 8th) starting at 10:00 AM, senior officials of the Police Department and officials from the Japanese Consulate, Army, Navy, and Gendarmerie, and the headquarters of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps discussed the details of returning the Northern District until 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Continued Talks</p>
<p>The two sides will continue to talk, but the date has not been determined.

<p>Responsibility for Delay</p>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported yesterday that during a Japanese news conference on the issue of returning police power in the Northern District, a foreign reporter asked, "Regarding the return of the management of the districts north of the Suzhou River to the Municipal Council, an agreement was reached on March 1, why has it not been implemented yet? Should the Japanese side be held responsible for this delay?" At the same time, another reporter asked, "The Japanese side only convened a meeting to return the Northern District of the public concession now, is it because the Municipal Council election is approaching, so it is using it?" However, the Japanese spokesperson smiled and replied at the time, "This is a kind of counter-propaganda from the outside world regarding the Japanese election."</p>

<p>The tuberculosis prevention campaign jointly launched by leaders from all walks of life in this city began on the 15th of last month and held a large-scale tuberculosis prevention examination at the Hongqiao Sanatorium. After the detection of lesions, free X-ray photography and sputum examination were provided. The method was unprecedented and created a new record in tuberculosis prevention in various countries. Citizens who went for examination were very enthusiastic. Up to yesterday, more than 2,000 people had been examined, and lung disease was found in more than 500 people, accounting for one-quarter of the total. One-sixth of the total number of patients was already beyond salvation. The detection and eradication of such latent tuberculosis and sources of tuberculosis bacteria is urgently needed by the isolated island public health. However, the association is limited by manpower and resources, and will announce its closure on the 15th of this month. It is heard that the free X-ray photos were donated by major philanthropists, and all the registration fees collected due to the limitation of the number of people will be allocated to the conference by the Hongqiao Sanatorium to be used for all the expenses of this tuberculosis prevention campaign, such as publicity. The enthusiasm for public welfare of the hospital is admirable. It is hoped that it will continue to contribute to this tuberculosis prevention work in the future and benefit the citizens.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to reliable sources, the weather is getting warmer and fundraising is difficult, so the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is planning to evacuate refugees to reduce the burden. Shanghai currently has approximately 40,000 Chinese refugees who rely entirely on relief for food and clothing, which requires</p>
<p>300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>per month to maintain. However, the association's funds are approximately 40,000 yuan short each month. According to a member of the association, the evacuation is just a plan and there is no definite action yet. Currently, Chinese refugees in Shanghai are taken care of by the association and its branches. Chairman Chu Qiaqing, in addition to fundraising to maintain directly affiliated refugees, must also provide food to other smaller reception centers. The association's branch cares for approximately 9,000 refugees in the reception centers, and the economy is also strained. Therefore, the association plans to</p>
<p>to the extent possible</p>
<p>evacuate the refugees and complete the work by the end of June. There are many refugees who voluntarily request to leave the center. Most of these people are from the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, who came to Shanghai with their families to escape the war, and now want to return home. The association plans to issue travel expenses if necessary. The first to be evacuated are the refugees who can support themselves, most of whom are peddlers and workers from the suburbs of Shanghai or nearby areas. The strong and strong will also be evacuated first, but the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans will still be taken in. Relief workers in this city plan to focus on the education of orphans left behind by refugees after the relief of refugees is over.</p>

<p>Since the opening of Hongkou in Northern District A of the Suzhou River, the Japanese soldiers patrolling have decreased, and the residents have gradually calmed down. Suddenly, at 2:10 PM yesterday (9th), several armed Japanese soldiers in black uniforms holding rifles entered Dexingli on the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenjianshi Road to inspect and interrogate pedestrians. As a result, they gained nothing, and those who were inspected were all frightened.</p>

<p>The "Central China Motor Bus Company," an investment organization of the Japanese side, is actively controlling transportation businesses in various places. In addition to other locations, the company has also operated several bus lines in the Hongkou, Jiangwan, and downtown areas of Shanghai, as well as the circular road in the Nanshi area. It is now learned that the company will further control the two bus lines in Pudong. The "Avenue Public Works Bureau" once operated three "bus" lines in Pudong: one from Dongchang Road to Shangnan Railway, one from Dongchang Road to Yangjing, and one from Gaoqiao Wharf to the seaside bathing beach. All vehicles were abandoned by the Municipal Public Works Bureau before the war. Later, the Dongchang Road to Shangnan Railway line was suspended due to a damaged body, leaving only two lines. Originally, the plan was to continue to profit from them, but the Central China Company, under the pretext of economic cooperation, took over all the "Pudong Bus Factory site vehicles, movable and immovable property" run by the "Avenue Public Works Bureau" the day before yesterday. From yesterday onwards, the business rights belong to Central China, and fares have also been increased uniformly. All "companies" opened by "Avenue" closed their doors yesterday, and all employees were dismissed.</p>

<p>Since the subsidiary coin panic occurred in this city last year, although multiple batches of fractional notes have been issued to meet market needs, they are still in short supply. The Shanghai Banking Association, in view of this, has discussed minting one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins to supplement the issuance for regulation. It is heard that these subsidiary coins can be circulated in the market today, and it is learned that those belonging to foreign merchants will collect from HSBC Bank, while those belonging to silver firms will collect from the Banking Association. Both will be fully prepared with legal tender without discount, and will be used in the same way as one-cent and five-cent subsidiary notes. It is expected that the market will no longer feel the lack of subsidiary coins in the future.</p>
<p>Issued Today</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the financial community yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has revised the Subsidiary Coin Regulations, and the central mint has started minting new one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins. The one-cent and two-cent coins are made of copper-zinc alloy, and the five-cent and ten-cent coins are made of copper-nickel-zinc alloy. They have been issued and circulated in the market since January 1st. As for the aluminum one-cent and five-cent new subsidiary coins in Shanghai, they were proposed by the Shanghai Banking Association and approved by the Ministry of Finance for minting. They have been minted, shipped to Shanghai, and will be issued by the Banking Association and HSBC Bank from today.</p>
<p>Number of Transactions</p>
<p>It is heard that aluminum subsidiary coins are calculated decimally. The number of coins equivalent to one yuan of legal tender is as follows: (1) twenty five-cent subsidiary coins, one hundred one-cent subsidiary coins. The number of transactions is in accordance with the Subsidiary Coin Regulations. The maximum transaction for five-cent subsidiary coins is twenty yuan of legal tender each time, and the maximum transaction for one-cent subsidiary coins is five yuan of legal tender each time. However, the collection and exchange of taxes are not subject to this restriction. As for the preparation of aluminum subsidiary coins, it is a full amount of legal tender, without discount, and will be used in the same way as fractional notes. The one-cent and five-cent fractional notes issued by the Central Bank will be temporarily suspended from further issuance.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Robbery of Huge Sum of Money on Qiujiang Road, Hongkou Yesterday, a Shipment from Changzhou Xiangfeng Exchange Was Robbed of 196,000 Yuan in Legal Tender <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>At around 0:40 PM yesterday, at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Sichuan Road in Hongkou, a business car was intercepted by bandits, and a huge sum of 196,000 yuan in legal tender was robbed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>Changzhou Xiangfeng Exchange does not have a branch in Shanghai, but has been in contact with Huiyuan Silver House at 94 Ranbo Road for many years. Yesterday morning around 9 AM, a large batch of cash, totaling 196,000 yuan in legal tender, was packed in leather suitcases and entrusted to two shop assistants to transport to Shanghai by train, to be deposited into Huiyuan Silver House. Around noon, when the train arrived at Wuxi Station, Manager Ji of Huiyuan Silver House in Shanghai happened to be on the same train and greeted them in the carriage.</p>
<p>Bandit Interception</p>
<p>At around 0:40 PM, the train arrived at the North Station. Ji and the two partners from Xiangfeng boarded the car and hired a business car from the station's Dada Car Company, instructing the driver to drive to Huiyuan Silver House on Ningbo Road. When passing the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road in Zhabei, four bandits suddenly emerged from the side of the road. Three of them held handguns, blocked the road, and forced the car to stop. Three bandits crowded into the car, while another bandit held a gun and monitored the driver, forcing him to drive straight to Hongkou. When they arrived at the intersection of Yalu Road and Yuanfang Road, the bandits threatened the victims and the driver to get out of the car, and another bandit drove the car eastward.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>After Ji and the others were driven out of the car, they regained their composure and reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the scene to investigate everything. The two partners from Xiangfeng Exchange were taken to the police station, and after the police chief's strict inquiry, due to the seriousness of the case, Chinese and foreign detectives were ordered to search for the bandits and bring them to justice. As of press time, the car driven away by the bandits had not been found.</p>

<p>Frenchman Pei Ai (transliteration), the head of the French Bicycle Company, left the company at 12:15 PM on the 9th, riding his own car No. 7200, driven by driver Peng Chaohua, back to his residence. When the car was driving on the Lvbans Road at the intersection of Ximen Road, heading north from the south, Zhou Zuomin (12 years old, from Shanghai, resident of No. 24 Xinmin Village, Malang Road), a male student of Fuchun Elementary School at No. 157 Lane 1, Lvbans Road, was going to school after lunch. He crossed the road from east to west and was unable to avoid the car, causing his head to be hit by the left fender of the car and injured. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died at 2:30 PM before he could be treated.</p>

<p>A kidnapping case occurred on Kang Nao Tuo Road the night before. Whether it contains political implications is still unknown. Gu Huanzhang, a local, is 47 years old and resides in a foreign house at No. 1097 on that road. He usually runs Guchun Shoe Store and Gongyi Leather Factory on Hubei Road. He usually owns a private car No. 5147, driven by driver Shen Shu. At 10:30 PM the night before, Gu was invited by a friend to a brothel in Huile Lane on Fuzhou Road. After drinking and the party broke up, Gu and accountant Lu Guowei boarded the car to return home. At that time, three men in short clothes, ambushed in the Jin Situ Temple Lane near Gu's house, jumped out when they saw Gu's car and drove the driver out with guns, speeding away and disappearing. After reporting to the police station for investigation, it was heard that Gu had received threatening letters before the incident.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Injury Doctor's Clinic Sued for Eviction; Appeal Hearing Concluded, Awaiting Judgment <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Qin Meifang, an injury doctor, has his clinic located at No. 56 Ningbo Road. Recently, he was sued in the Civil Court of the First Special Court by Wei Dingpu, the small owner of the Weiqingji Construction Factory, his landlord, requesting eviction. The reason is that he wanted to take it back for his own use. The first instance ruled that Qin Meifang lost the case. Qin refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Yan Yin to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, stating the reasons for the appeal and requesting that the original judgment be revoked and the plaintiff's request in the first instance be rejected. According to the lease in dispute between the two parties, it is an indefinite lease. In this extraordinary period, all courts carefully consider cases involving indefinite leases, because in Shanghai today, the demand for rental housing exceeds the supply, and tenants really have nowhere to find housing, while landlords deliberately fabricate reasons to sue in the name of taking back the property for their own use, hoping to replace it with a new tenant and absorb huge rents. The court sees through their tricks, and eviction suits are not easily granted, so the safety of citizens can be guaranteed. It is found that eviction incidents are often based on Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. However, the second half of that paragraph clearly stipulates that habits favorable to the tenant must be taken into account. If they conflict with habits favorable to the tenant, there is no reason to grant eviction. Now, the plaintiff's claim to take it back for his own use is completely false, and it is actually due to a failed rent increase. It is found that the plaintiff's entire family consists of only six people, and they now live in seven large rooms upstairs, which means that each person occupies a room alone, which is more than enough. Why should he seek other arrangements? Moreover, in addition to the bedroom, the plaintiff also has a reception room and a storage room, and rents the three-bay main hall in the rear of the downstairs, the front and rear unified rooms of the west wing downstairs, and the two large rooms on the west side downstairs to Zhang Dongming's wine shop. Therefore, even if he wants to take it back for his own use, he should make a claim against Zhang Dongming, and there is no reason to order the appellant, who lives in the east wing downstairs, to evict. How can a judgment of eviction be in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code? Based on the above facts and reasons, he requested that the original judgment be revoked and that the plaintiff's request in the first instance be dismissed. The costs of litigation in both instances should be borne by the appellee. Yesterday morning, the civil court of the Second Branch of the High Court held a hearing on this case and concluded the hearing. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 15th.</p>

<p>Zhou Xisheng, a six-year-old boy named Wenzhao, who lived in Changzhou and ran a plank box shop on Robertsen Road, was abducted on the afternoon of the 10th of last month by Xu Ronghu, a former apprentice in Zhou Xisheng's copper shop, and Xu Genda, a fellow apprentice who was on the run. They were hidden in Changzhou and wrote a letter demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan. The case was discovered, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special Court. Zhou's family sent someone to Changzhou to retrieve the child. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested strict punishment for Xu, the apprentice, for using kidnapping to extort money. The order was received to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang came to the Third Criminal Court to pronounce the verdict, sentencing Xu Ronghu to three years and six months in prison as a warning.</p>

However, due to the impact of the cross-border road construction this year, the number of tourists to Zhaofeng Park has decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Case of Overdraft of US Optical Factory's Collateral Continued to be Heard Yesterday, Proving that the Appropriation Slip Was Indeed Claimed by US Optical <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The case in which Xu Shihao and Zuo De, lawyers formerly employed by Zhejiang Industrial Bank, sued the US Optical Dyeing and Weaving Factory in the Civil Court of the First Special Court for collateral and overdraft, and demanded the recovery of 70,000 yuan in appropriation slips has been reported by this newspaper after two summonses by Judge Mo Jianhua. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the hearing again. Ye Jingkui, the former general manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and lawyers Xu and Zuo appeared in court. Jiang Yanwu, the manager of the defendant US Optical, and the guarantor Tang Yanxiu did not appear and were represented by lawyer Qian Jialong. First, the plaintiff's lawyer Xu Shihao stated:</p>
<p>All the witnesses the plaintiff requested to be summoned were in court. Judge Mo then summoned witness Zhang Qidong to testify. He was an employee in the current deposit department of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. On June 29 last year, Tang Yanxiu, the deputy manager of US Optical Factory, came to collect the money with the 70,000 yuan check. At that time, due to a temporary mistake, I gave him a blank appropriation slip. Before long, I suddenly remembered that after the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian restricted withdrawals, the manager's office had notified that customers with outstanding debts should use deposits to offset debts.</p>
<p>I realized my mistake</p>
<p>Because Tang was an old classmate, I rushed to Tang to ask him to return the appropriation slip. Because Tang insisted on not returning it, I had no choice but to report it to the manager's office, and the manager's office sent a letter to the check clearing house to stop payment. At this point, lawyer Xu Shihao stated that the appropriation slip not only proves that it was claimed by US Optical Factory, but also knows that the factory paid it to Zhejiang Industrial Bank for the German-character company's pigment collateral. This point can be proven by witness Jiang Yizhi. Then Jiang Yizhi testified that he was from Xingye Bank</p>
<p>Managing Director</p>
<p>The defendant Jiang Yanwu is my grand-nephew. Last July, I returned to Shanghai from Beiping and learned about this matter. According to the report, I knew that the appropriation slip was claimed by the US Optical Factory. We were all our own people, so I tried my best to mediate. Because the US Optical Factory paid the appropriation slip to Zhejiang Industrial Bank for the De Fuyuan pigment collateral, and it was stopped for payment, I thought it was a loss of face, so it was difficult to reach a settlement. Also, according to witnesses Yan Ouke, the supervisor of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhang Dusheng, the director, and Xu Jiluo, the managing director,</p>
<p>Further Proof</p>
<p>All said that the appropriation slip was claimed by the US Optical Factory itself, and Jiang also personally came to the bank to discuss and requested accommodation, etc. Finally, Ye Jingkui, the chairman and general manager, said that the appropriation slip was actually mistakenly paid by the staff in a hurry. Because after receiving the Ma Dian from the Ministry of Finance, all customers were required to use deposits to offset debts. The plaintiff had informed the defendant of the regulations. The defendant knew that the deposit had been used to offset the debt and actually signed a check for 70,000 yuan to withdraw from the bank. Although it was mistakenly paid by the bank clerk, this deposit had been used to offset the debt, and the bank</p>
<p>Naturally Stopped Payment</p>
<p>In order to clarify the truth, lawyer Xu Shihao requested the court to obtain the account books and vouchers related to the Shengji account from Zhejiang Industrial Bank to prove the relationship between US Optical and Shengji and the purpose of the 70,000 yuan appropriation slip. Whether Shengji and US Optical were one and the same, or two different entities. The defendant's lawyer Qian said that all those who attended the court today are directors and staff, and cannot be regarded as witnesses. It can only be said that the party asked the party to conclude, and there is no precedent for this. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Cui Dengjie, a native of Pudong, is 27 years old and works as a mason. He and his wife, Cui Sun (25 years old this year), live at No. 1783 Robertsen Road, Shanghai West. Cui is usually away working, so the relationship between husband and wife is not very satisfactory. Therefore, Sun has an affair. The night before, after Cui returned from Nanjing, Yang Rongde, his wife Sun's lover, suddenly became jealous. Suddenly, at 6:20 AM yesterday morning, while Cui and his wife were still in bed, he broke into the room with a knife and chopped Cui's head, and also injured Cui Sun's forehead and lips. The murderer Yang Rongde saw that his goal had been achieved and fled the scene. Later, the residents of the neighborhood reported to the police, and Cui and his wife were taken to the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road for treatment. At the same time, the police station sent detectives to arrest Yang. He was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer said that the victim was still in the hospital and could not appear in court, so he requested an adjournment. Judge Huang took the seat and interrogated the defendant, who admitted that he had injured him because of jealousy and anger. After verifying the words, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned for seven days.</p>

<p>The Hu Gui Xiong Lu kidney tonic pills (also known as Fugui Ronglu kidney tonic pills) issued by Chen Taiyan of Meiling Pharmacy were registered with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and held Approval No. 28540, and were published in the Official Gazette. Moreover, after the issuance, they were repeatedly advertised in newspapers and were well known to the public. Last year, Han Longzhou of Liuzhou Pharmacy was sued because the kidney tonic pills produced by him had a picture of a large black turtle on the box, and the Hu Gui Xiong Lu tonic pills issued by Chen Taiyan also had a small turtle on the box, which was suspected of imitation. He filed a criminal self-prosecution with the First District Court. The first instance had already ruled that Chen Taiyan was not guilty. Han Longzhou refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal again. Yesterday, Zhou Han, the president of the Second Branch of the High Court, summoned both parties to court for a hearing. Chen Taiyan, the appellee, hired three lawyers, Qian Xingzhong, Zhu Qichao, and Huang Huancheng, to defend him. After Zhou, the president, carefully examined the documentary evidence, he ordered the debate to be concluded and set a date for the verdict.</p>

<p>Zhu Rongqing, an unemployed young man from Wuxi who lives in Room 18, Lushan Apartment, Julai Da Road, broke into Room 17 next door on the morning of the 6th of this month and stole a Western suit, which he pawned for 80 yuan.

<p>Shen Sibao, a girl from Ningbo who lives at No. 88 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, and is 12 years old this year, suddenly suffered from vomiting and diarrhea at around 3 PM on the 7th. Her condition did not improve in the evening. Her parents gave her two pills of A.P.C., but because the medicine was too strong, she was poisoned and fell unconscious. Her family thought she had an epidemic disease and sent her to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Aiduya Road at 10 PM that night. Because the poisoning was too deep, she died despite treatment.</p>
<p>A fire broke out in a grass shed in Nanyaojiage, Zhaofeng Garden, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West, at around 6 AM. Because the grass was dry and the weather was dry, the fire spread immediately and became uncontrollable. As a result, more than 200 grass sheds there were burned to the ground. Fortunately, it was daytime, and no one was injured. However, it was heard that the residents of the shantytown raised hundreds of pigs, all of which were burned to death.</p>
<p>At 1:15 AM yesterday morning, a large number of patrolmen from the Public Concession were patrolling Singapore Road in Shanghai West when they caught sight of three men loitering near the Public University Yarn Factory. They stepped forward and ordered them to stop. The three men were actually bandits and fled into the lane next to the factory. When they fled, one bandit fired a shot.</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM yesterday morning, a truck No. 23464 of the Jiankang Truck Company was driving north over the Wuzhen Road Bridge when Wang Wenshan (36 years old, from Taixian, resident of Taojiadu, Habei, Caojiadu), a small worker on the truck, lost his footing and fell, smashing his skull.

<p>Yongsheng Rice Store at No. 7, Lane 466, Tianjin Road, had previously ordered a large quantity of rice from Qingfeng, Qingyuan, Xiemao, Rendashun, Yisheng, and Shunfeng rice stores. After taking delivery of the goods, the payment was not paid, and the store announced its closure and liquidation. In total, the rice defrauded from the above stores was worth approximately 50,000 yuan. Xue Caizhang, the manager of the store, and Xu Runlin, the assistant manager,</p>
<p>Escaped Without a Trace</p>
<p>Qingfeng and others commissioned lawyer Wu Linkun to report to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan obtained a copy of the Yongsheng partnership agreement from the Rice Store Association and learned that the shareholders of the store, in addition to Xue Caizhang, also included Tong Shouchcheng and Wang Xingsheng. According to the complainants, Tong Shouchcheng is Tong Zongyao, the owner of Shenyangtai Rice Store at No. 278, Lafayette Road, and Wang Xingsheng is Wang Xingsen, the owner of Longsheng Rice Store at No. 565, Sichuan Road. The police then</p>
<p>Detained Tong and Wang</p>
<p>and sent them to the First Special Court, ordering each to pay 30,000 yuan for bail. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Fourth Court for a continued hearing on this case. Wang Xingsen hired Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi, and Tong Zongyao hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them. Xu Yesun, the witness to the Yongsheng partnership agreement, also appeared in court accompanied by lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang. The police lawyer Peng Qiqi stated that the police are prosecuting under Article 237 of the Criminal Code for fraud. Today, the witnesses to the agreement, Fu Qiangeng and Xu Yesun,</p>
<p>Are in Court to Testify</p>
<p>etc. First, Fu Yuan Geng testified that before Xu Runlin and others organized Yongsheng, they had talked to me about it and then invited me to be a witness. When the agreement was signed, the so-called shareholders Tong Shouchcheng and Wang Xingsen did not come to the scene. Only Xu Runlin represented them and stamped the agreement and paid the shares. Therefore, neither of the two defendants came to the scene before or after the event. Xu Yesun's statement was the same as Fu's and stated that the participation of Tong and Wang in the Yongsheng organization was only hearsay and had not been witnessed. Wang Xingsen</p>
<p>Completely Denied</p>
<p>that he had ever negotiated or actually participated in any matters related to Yongsheng before or after the event. Moreover, Wang Xingsen in the agreement was different, and the seal was not consistent. This time, he was unjustly wronged. Tong Zongyao completely denied the name of Tong Shouchcheng and stated that he had never participated in the organization of Yongsheng. After Judge Liao verified the testimony, he ordered the debate to begin. After mutual debate by the lawyers on both sides, the court announced the conclusion and ruled that Wang Xingsen and Tong Zongyao were not guilty.</p>

<p>Returning the Calligraphy to its Origin</p>
<p>At Plum Blossom Ridge in Guangling, there was formerly the clothing and hat tomb of the Ming Dynasty official, Minister Shi Kefa. During the Qianlong reign, Vice Minister Peng Yuanrui obtained the public portrait of the official and respectfully presented it for the Emperor's inspection. He was posthumously awarded the title "Zhongzheng" (Loyal and Upright), and a shrine was built and repaired. The Emperor composed poems and essays, and the officials harmonized their rhymes. By imperial decree, these were engraved on stone tablets on the shrine walls to encourage loyalty among officials. Sacrifices were offered by officials every spring and autumn, a grand ceremony. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns, after the ravages of war, the shrine and the inscriptions were completely destroyed. Recently, it was learned that Shi Zhaolin, a descendant of the official, believing that the virtuous deeds of his ancestors should not be forgotten, specially requested the local officials to donate funds to repair the tomb and build the shrine, and to reprint his posthumous works. A traveler passing by saw that the plum trees and stones were gradually restored to their original appearance, but the Imperial Stele Pavilion had not yet been rebuilt. In front of the tomb is a cannon, made during the Chongzhen reign, cast by the Ministry of War's Grand Hall. It is thought to be a relic from the wartime. It was previously unearthed by a magistrate of a certain county when digging a moat. Now, Zhaolin has also requested its return, intending to preserve it in the shrine, a reminder of the touch of history. Furthermore, at a mounting shop in Shanghai, he obtained two texts: a reading of Minister Shi Kefa's essay from the year Wuzi, and the dedication and memorial oration drafted by his disciple Ge Ning, along with a thousand-word poem, in imitation of the Plum Blossom Ridge painting scroll. Also, he saw a small portrait in Zhu Yi (red official robe) of the Minister, admired by Mr. Gu Nanya when he was the head of the Plum Blossom Hospital, upon which was written the Imperial poems and annotations. Moreover, the shop owner presented a hundred pieces of the Minister's handwritten letters, seals, military documents, and reports, truly rare treasures. It is said that Zhaolin obtained all of these in Shanghai last winter, purchasing the memorial essays and small portraits back at a high price. The shrine map scroll had long been collected by Cai Jun Luqing of Ningbo, and Zhaolin obtained it through earnest entreaty. That these items could still return to the Shi family after two hundred years is due to the diligent searching of the descendants, but also to the silent protection of the gods, allowing them to survive the ravages of war unscathed. Furthermore, Zhaolin also purchased ten scrolls of the Minister's personally written family precepts. The instructions are sincere and the calligraphy is elegant. Connoisseurs of antiquities especially love to keep them.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Human Hell: A Quick Sketch of "Noodle" Addicts' Nest <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yu</p>
<p>When the earth is filled with the spirit of spring, and everything awakens from slumber, the group of people on the north bank of Suzhou Creek who regard inhaling "white noodles" (also known as heroin) as their second life will once again become active. In this narrow, filthy alley filled with garbage and excrement, constantly permeated with a suffocating, moldy odor, they have once again taken possession. Like a flock of swallows, when spring returns, they follow and return to their old nest where they once lingered for a time.</p>
<p>Thus, the yurt-like nests once again enter our field of vision. These simple structures, with one side facing the wall and the other three sides and the top covered with broken mats, are huddled together, totaling seven in number. About three feet high, they can generally accommodate three or four people. During the day, one can often see three or four people huddled around a candle stub, bending over and greedily inhaling the bloodless killer "white noodles" from tin foil through a thick paper rolled into a tube.</p>
<p>They are almost all equally thin and tattered, proving that their flesh and blood have been completely absorbed by this poison. Only a shell supported by a layer of skin and a few bones remains, tottering in and out busily.</p>
<p>Whenever they receive a small paper packet from the Korean dealer (seller of white noodles), it is as if they have obtained a rare treasure. A wave of joy sweeps across their thin and filthy faces. This means that their sole purpose in life is built upon this small packet of grace.</p>
<p>However, what is strange is that in these times of rising rice prices, when people cannot even manage to fill their stomachs, where do they get the money to maintain their "white noodle" habit? Moreover, it is not a small sum (according to them, each person has to consume two packets of white noodles a day, divided into three doses, at a price of two jiao per packet). This is something that everyone would be surprised by, right? But if you just ask the residents of our alley, they will tell you the source.</p>
<p>Originally, their main base is in the vegetable market by the Old Zhabei Bridge. Taking advantage of the busy trade, when people are bustling around and have no time to pay attention, they use their skilled and agile methods to snatch some vegetables or other food, and then sell it at a cheap price. Therefore, a humorous saying, "Old Zhabei Bridge is their savings bank," is popular in our alley.</p>
<p>However, when using this method, if they happen to be caught by the owner of the stolen goods, then a beating is hard to avoid. Fists and feet rain down on them, and they use words that are unbelievably humble to beg for mercy. But as soon as they turn around, they are doing the same thing again, perhaps receiving the same beating again. Heavens! What magic is driving them? It can be said that they have no soul, no flesh, and apart from "white noodles," they have nothing else to cherish in this world.</p>
<p>Besides the Old Zhabei Bridge, at other times, anything worth a few coins and easy to carry is liable to be stolen by them. Especially the residents of this alley, who must be constantly vigilant, otherwise, if you are not careful, you will quickly find something missing.</p>
<p>I once asked an older "white noodle" addict about the reason why he became addicted to "white noodles." I had been wondering for many days why so many people would approach "white noodles," which contains such deep poison. I thought that perhaps they had special difficulties. But this old man did not answer me according to my question. He just muttered that he used to be from a good family, but ever since he became addicted to "white noodles," he was reduced to ruin and his family was scattered. Now, it is too late to regret it. Finally, he said, "Ah! Sir, this is the debt we owed to the ×× people in our previous life, so we have to repay them piecemeal in this life. You don't know, it doesn't matter if you go hungry for a few days, but when the craving for "white noodles" comes, it is truly worse than death!"</p>
<p>Indeed, what we should not overlook here are the tall Korean men who stroll back and forth at the entrance of the alley every afternoon, two or three of them. They all wear pretty suits and carry a small cloth bag in their hands. When each trembling and filthy hand stretches out a few coins to them, what a triumphant look shines on their swarthy faces.</p>
<p>I remember that last year, there was one time when they were taken away by the "black car," but in a few days, they came back again, with an even more triumphant and arrogant smile on their faces, as if saying, "What? Do you think that would work? We're back!" Who doesn't know that they have even more powerful backers?</p>
<p>The old ones disappear, and new ones fill their place. In this small alley, this kind of metabolism is always taking place. Every day, there are always a few new faces swaying before my eyes. Some even wear relatively neat clothes when they first come, but in a few days, they are also reduced to the same state. What a terrible policy of poisoning! Will the will of our nation really sink so low? I wonder fearfully, although I also feel that this is superfluous.</p>
<p>Here, we can only earnestly hope that the security authorities can come up with an active and effective method to help those who are immersed in the sea of suffering to escape. At the same time, this is also of great relevance to the security of the concession.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Principles of Being a Person: An Early Sweep Through Examinations, Books, Vegetables, Fish, and Pigs <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Qiang Gong</p>
<p>Recently, during a public banquet given by the Chongqing authorities for national representatives of people's education, President Jiang, in his speech, mentioned the eight words Zeng Wenzhenggong taught his children: "Old, Treasure, Early, Sweep, Books, Vegetables, Fish, Pigs," urging today's students to put effort into these eight words, and that every school, according to this principle, should consider the environment and objective circumstances, and find ways to implement them, and so on. This is truly a principle of being a person that everyone should follow.</p>
<p>These eight words are very clear and need no explanation. In short, they mean "benevolence and cherishing things." The aim is to teach people to get close to everyday life, and to seek the principles of being a person in everyday life.</p>
<p>Every word in these eight words is achievable. In the past, everyone seemed to have overlooked these eight aspects. By overlooking these eight words, we can also say that they have not truly come into contact with everyday life. Without contact with everyday life, then perhaps they have not yet engaged in being a person, but seem to be acting like "supermen" (referring to those who have transcended the realm of humans). This is a point of meaning that we should repent and work hard to pay attention to in these eight words.</p>
<p>Many past facts tell us that students only knew how to study, and forgot the truth of "learning for application." They only knew how to live an empty life, and did not pay attention to practical life. It seemed as if the students studying at school were separate from the people outside the school. Therefore, as soon as students leave school, they are simply overwhelmed, feeling lost. After a round of applause of "great prospects" sends them out of the school gate, they are immediately left aside by society, with no way forward. Even if they are not rejected, they are quite frustrated on the road. Theory, righteousness, outline, oral records, quotations, definitions, laws, etc., without everyday life, how to handle the first step of entering society, how to melt the great principles from books into society, this has formed many informed people's deep feelings of "educational grounding."</p>
<p>The central idea here is not to tell students to despise knowledge, but to ask students to value practical knowledge, read a sentence of classics, read a few lines of text, read a few volumes of books, and not be empty. On the one hand, seek learning, on the other hand, investigate things. This is to make the country's intention of cultivating people useful to everyone. The eight words only urge people to pay attention to one aspect of everyday life, and from this to further enrich the principles of being a person and dealing with the world.</p>
<h3 id="e107">After the Rain Clears <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22 News Takes Flight from Beyond the Horizon, Revered Opinions and Grand Arguments Are Human Beliefs</p>
<p>Jin Danyu did not want to take the seat, but Shao Huihua pulled her and pressed her into the seat. One should not underestimate Shao Huihua. She is not tall, but she has strength. Her father taught her some soft martial arts. Two or three strong men are nothing to her. If it were in the seven or eight years before the war in China, when martial arts novels were popular, Shao Huihua would have been portrayed as a chivalrous woman. However, Qu Wushuang's invitation today can be considered a "one thing, two purposes" affair. One is to welcome Jin Danyu and her new marriage; the other is that she is connecting with this group of progressive women. Besides Shao Huihua, who is from this newspaper office, the other women can also pick up a pen and write an article. For example, invite Zhu Airen to write some medical opinions, the He sisters to write some textile opinions, Wu Junsu to write some educational opinions, and Jin Danyu, with her extensive experience, can also express opinions on European and American society and social interactions. These are all needed for her "Women's Garden" column and the "Women's Life" magazine that she edits. In fact, these expenses are all paid by the newspaper office and do not require Miss Qu Wushuang to pay out of her own pocket. That is what is called entertainment expenses. A large newspaper office like this has entertainment expenses included in its legitimate expenses every year. Therefore, their large restaurant almost invites guests there every day. It is certainly not like the newspaper industry in China twenty years ago, where news reporters were often invited to other people's banquets, but news reporters rarely invited others. Let's say that Qu Wushuang invited them to eat Western food today, but the materials are all native to China. Even all the utensils are domestically made. Moreover, this newspaper office is even more particular. All the porcelain basins, knives and forks, napkins, etc. are custom-made and have the name of the newspaper office on them. Even the cigarettes and matchboxes given to guests have the name of the newspaper office printed on them. This restaurant has two kinds of dishes, one is Chinese and the other is Western, according to each person's preferences. However, most of the materials are domestic products, and only a very small amount are imported, which are just canned foods. During their banquet, they talked freely. Zhu Airen said, "I didn't expect our country's news industry to develop so quickly. When I was a child, I heard my grandfather talk about how Chinese newspapers were oppressed to the point of suffocation during the war, but they still have this day. At that time, I heard my grandfather say that three people ran a newspaper office. One person was in charge of editing, one person was in charge of printing, and one person was in charge of distribution. But their newspaper was run very well. Especially their newspaper office's assets, which when mentioned, would really make people laugh, were only one dan (a unit of weight), which could be carried on the shoulder." (261)</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Lessons of Trees (Arbor Day) (2) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>(3) Bearing Fruit. The standard value of a tree lies in bearing fruit, not in just growing tall and large. We look at people in the same way. We should not look at their height, appearance, education, status, and wealth, but at what they do. Their deeds are the fruits borne by their spirit. Although a tree may be large, in our view, it is not as good as a fruit-bearing tree, because the latter bears fruit while the former does not. (4) Implication. A father said to his son, "Take the fruit of a tree and cut it open to see what's inside." The son replied, "There's only a seed." The father said, "Cut open the seed to see what's inside." The son said, "There's nothing." The wise father said, "Son, you say there's nothing, but you're wrong. There's a big tree inside!" This lesson is to say that regardless of the size of the fruit, it contains life inside. This life is most precious. Speaking of our rich life, if we do not make progress and cannot bear fruit, we are just occupying the land in vain, which is a great shame to our enemies. (5) Obligation. When a tree grows into lumber, it is sent to a sawmill to be sawn into various materials. This is its original service to the people. It can be used to build mansions, bridges, utensils, and make all kinds of tools. The value of a tree lies in the fact that it does not exist for itself, but in serving others. People should also be like this. Why was Jesus crucified? In a nutshell, it was for the people. His death enabled the sins of the world to be forgiven, and he became one with God the Father. Therefore, we should not live solely for ourselves. We have obligations to the world. In short, trees are the most useful things, and we should learn from trees the lessons of being a person. Please pay attention, everyone. "He himself bore our sins" in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." (The end) (If you want to study the Gospel, please send your letter to No. 1227)</p>

<h3 id="e109">Thoughts After Watching "The Peach Blossom Spring" <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Yu Sheng'an said that writing articles is like a lion playing with an embroidered ball. There is only one ball, but the lion exerts all its skills, circling left and right, right and left, never letting go, but not grabbing it either. However, the lion's rolling this way and that way is all for the ball (the general idea is like this). I say that playwriting and acting should also adopt this method.</p>
<p>"The Peach Blossom Spring" performed by the Great Bell Drama Society has a very thought-provoking theme that strengthens people's faith and can be considered a good allegory drama that awakens the world. Unfortunately, it makes the theme too real, not daring to relax at all, as if the lion has bitten the embroidered ball in its mouth, then what is there to roll? In the final scene of song and dance, several of the girls are quite good-looking, especially the one who plays the flower god, who has a kind of innocence and charm. However, in terms of art, they still feel not very skilled, and the dance poses still feel not beautified enough. The most important thing in acting is to be able to absorb the audience's tense emotions. Indeed, the writing and directing of allegory dramas is more difficult to handle than other types of dramas. In my observation, the members of the Great Bell Society may have more people with profound knowledge than other companies. I very much hope that people with profound knowledge can use the power of art to spread it deeply into the hearts of people at all levels. However, on that day, not only myself and my friends, but the faces of the audience in the theater all revealed a little dull and bored look. I hope that the Great Bell Drama Society can seek further improvement in art. I am confident that this is a well-intentioned and sincere suggestion.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Mystery of Bai Yang <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>She hasn't come to Shanghai, but she may come to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The news of Bai Yang's coming to Shanghai spread as early as last year when Xinhua Company invited them (and Gao Zhanfei) to make a film. However, on the one hand, the China Film Studio had new films waiting to be shot, and on the other hand, if Gao Zhanfei also returned to Shanghai, there would be a little conflict. Therefore, the rumors of Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei coming to Shanghai, which were once widely spread, finally did not succeed even in the plan of Xinhua to allow them to shoot films in Hong Kong. However, recently, rumors of Bai Yang's return to Shanghai have been spreading again, and it is said that she has already returned (nothing was mentioned about Gao Zhanfei); moreover, that she has been in Shanghai for two or three weeks. This news is naturally unreliable. To speculate, Bai Yang is a famous movie star, and it may be possible for her to come to Shanghai secretly, but to have been in Shanghai for two or three weeks without any "follow-up," it is definitely impossible to "keep it a secret" to this extent. To prove it with facts, the Chongqing Xinshu Bao of March 16 published an advertisement for her and Gu Eryi performing "Frontier Storm," and on the 4th, she acted as a bridesmaid in Wei Heling's wedding, so her coming to Shanghai and Gu Eryi's death were both proven to be untrue.</p>
<p>However, another message has been received from Hong Kong. According to a friend who wrote a letter, "Recently, a certain company (the letter) is in consultation on Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei coming here (Hong Kong) to shoot films. The extent of the negotiations is not known in detail; I will continue to inform you as soon as there is definite news..."</p>
<p>The so-called "certain company," smart readers may think of which company it is. However, "definite news" is of course in the unknowable realm. From this news, it can be further proven that Bai Yang has not come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Miscellaneous Comments on the Wenyi Society's Rehearsal <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Da Gui</p>
<p>The Wenyi Society was founded by Qiu Shouyi and Zhou Guiwen, a married couple. Its predecessor was the Fenghua National Drama Research Society. After the outbreak of the war, it moved to Shanghai and changed its name to the current name. The society held its first rehearsal at the Ningbo Fellow Association the other day. I was invited by a friend to attend and watch. The performances on that day, in addition to the old amateur performers who had been playing for a long time, the new amateur performers who took the stage for the first time also achieved remarkable results. For example, Miss Chen Aihua's performance in "Cosmic Madness," with her lively and skilled gestures and postures when pretending to be crazy, combined both. Miss Chen is very young and tried new sounds for the first time. With these results, it can be seen that she has worked hard. If she practices diligently, her future is very promising. Wang Bingheng and Guan Liping's "Fenhe Bay," Bingheng's Ren Gui is quite adequate. Miss Guan's Yingchun's acting has reached a perfect state, but it is a pity that her voice is not bright, which reduces the charm. Chen Kaitong, Huang Huanong, and Zhang Haishan's "Yellow Crane Tower," Kaitong's Zhou Lang, Huanong's Zilong, and Haishan's Zhang Fei, all seem to be taking the stage for the first time. Huanong's appearance is heroic and martial, and he usually practices a lot, so he is also a promising talent. Kaitong's young man and Haishan's painted face can be called stable. Shu Yanzhai and Lu Linyu's "Empty City Stratagem," Linyu's Sima Zhongda, is a very common pure sound, a copper hammer material among amateur performers. Yanzhai has been in the amateur world for a long time, so he has the courage to perform the entire "Empty City Stratagem." The whole play is performed, which can be considered steady and quiet, but there are a few points in it that I think are worthy of discussion. For example, the introductory song "The four-wheeled cart is as fast as wind and clouds" seems too fast, and the shaking board "Xiao Ma Su lost Jieting, which is hateful" seems too slow. In the Erliu "I am watching the mountain scenery on the city tower," the three words "watching the mountain scenery" seem too low. I asked Mr. Shu what he thought. Wang Yihong has been studying drama for many years, covering all aspects of male, female, painted face, and clown, and has taken the stage many times, so he has considerable experience in the stage. On this day, he performed two plays, one was "Golden Platform" and the other was "Yellow Crane Tower," and the results were above standard. Mr. Wang once said that amateur performers studying opera must study all the main and supporting roles in the play, and even be able to play them all, which is especially helpful for improving the entire drama. Taking this rehearsal as an example, he played Kong Ming in the previous performance of "Yellow Crane Tower," and this time he played Liu Bei. Although he played Tian Dan in "Golden Platform," he also knows all the singing lines and recitations of the Yili role very well. Therefore, for amateur performers learning opera, it is best to explore and practice in many ways to increase the splendor of the entire play, which is indeed one of the things that amateur performers must know.</p>
<h3 id="e112">A New Art of Entrapment <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Since the film "The Invisible Man" caused a sensation in the film world, Universal Pictures has had a plan to shoot "The New Invisible Man." It took a year and cost a lot of money, and finally succeeded. The story of this film is entirely based on "The Invisible Man," and includes things such as prison escape, revenge, and washing away grievances. The whole film is tense and exciting, and in terms of skills, whether it is acting or photography, it is better than "The Invisible Man." The scene of the Invisible Man's appearance at the end is even more valuable for medical physiology. "The New Invisible Man" stars Vincent Price and Nan Grey. The film has arrived in Shanghai and will be premiered at the Grand Shanghai Cinema on the 11th.</p>
