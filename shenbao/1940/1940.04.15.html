<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本今後的策略</h3>
<p>據東京消息：日軍部於本月七日主十一日間召集內外各軍事首長及其代表，舉行重要軍事會議。據聞曾就加緊團結，軍民合作，對華作戰目標曁齋藤失言案等問題加以研討。像這樣一個會議，其經過與結果自非外間所能輕易得悉，因之頗難加以確切的論斷。但目前日方一切動向自當仍以對華問題爲主要中心，在軍事方面也不外縝密攷慮其最近發動政治攻勢後的侵華戰略。單就這一點和上述軍事曾議的幾個議題來看：已足說明日方這、一次的政治攻勢是一個失敗的傑作。</p>
<p>不問日當局關於侵華一舉，揭櫫何等冠冕堂皇的口號和宣傳，其終極的目標總不外於征服中國奴役中國，這是任何略具常識的人都能辨明的事：無論其所從事的是軍事進攻，抑或政治外交經濟各方的攻勢，也都不外是達釗這一目標的手段。在日閥對於信種種手段原無所愛僧軒輊於其間，只是因時制宜而加以抉擇運用。軍事進攻當然費力最多犧牲最大，三年前盲目的以此爲侵華主要方式，但最近年餘以來則已證明其無法獲致確定的成就，且已形成日方過重的負擔。於是政治方面的運用就代替着軍事上的部署而被列到第一綫的重要地位。其實這一運用，即就日本本國輿論來看，也並未作很高的估價；至多不過冀其能使厭戰的日本軍民發生一點新的憧憬。實際上的收穫不但未能與其已往侵略收種相頡頏，不但未能代替了侵華日軍的任務，目更增加其負擔。如果說此種攻勢在日方是當作興奮麻醉劑而使用的，則經過這一番興奮麻醉以及繼之而起的失望波動而後，業已十分疲敝的兵力士氣，也必將吏加頹唐，更加脆弱，連己往那一點戰鬥水準也難繼續保持。在此度東京軍事曾議議題當中，據說促進加緊團結和軍民密切合作都是重要的一項，可見日本內部離析渙散的現象必己逐漸表面化，因之纔引起其軍事中樞的注意。</p>
<p>但是，不論日本政治攻勢的或存或廢或如何繼事運用。也不論日方軍事實力己衰疲到何等程度，在此度軍事會議之後，侵華日軍再作一度積極行動，自在意中。至於其動向究將續謀深入內地，還是準備負嵎於淪陷區，或是北守南進，抑或轉而北侵，皆待事實證明。大體說來：根據過去經騐，年餘以來日軍進侵的企圖，、沒有一次如願以償，也沒有一次不遭受嚴重敗衂，尤如最近綏西桂南贛北諸役，都提供了極明顯的例證。即使今後日軍變更戰略，把主力集中一隅，以求倖逞；然就戰局全盤說來，如果日方不能大舉增兵，則雖欲繼續內犯，終必亳無成就；若僅事增兵三數師團，真是祗夠短時間的消耗。考察種種事實與情勢，試加推測，則今後日方戰略要在以攻爲守。僅求將其所佔的點綫，形成平面；至多亦無過於企圖打通南北各交通幹綫。雖日方的實力是否容許作此企圖，尙是絕大疑問，但其意念當不外此。再就日方發展的方向來看：最近日閥正虎視耽眈準備趁歐戰擴大的時機侵襲西方國家在南洋的屬領，且與其外交攻勢相互配合，既謀威脅中國西南後方的抗建根據地，復謀假借國際來威脅中國而要挾英法；故其在華中華南所佔有各海陸據點必被看成一切軍事佈置的重心以冀造就其傳統的南進國策的張本。同時日本勾結蘇聯的企圖雖告失敗，但蘇聯既未必會捲入歐戰漩渦，則日本史不肯驟以反蘇十字軍前哨自任，北向而作冒險的經營。綜上所諭，此次東京軍事會議中所研討對華作戰目標問題，殆爲重新估計其殘餘的力量而謀集中於淪陷區的所謂「掃蕩戰」，且更着重於華中華南點錢的保持與打通。</p>
<p>日來頗傳日軍已在縮短戰綫，停止進攻，就目前一時情形來看，這原是可能的事；更就最近三數日京滬綫上若千地點的調遣觀之，尤得部份的明證；但日閥儘管强調其政治攻勢以自　目欺，却必即行放鬆其軍事方面的運用。固然，即使日軍再盲目進犯，也不過多創造一些新的敗衂；即使一時的麻醉與興奮，終必至民氣愈衰頹，兵力愈鈍挫，終於連守勢也無從保持。但就中國方面而論，仍應鑒於日方最近的種種佈置和調度而務必嚴重的戒備。</p>
<p>中日間關係縱在政治外交經濟各方面都形成緊張的爭戰，其最後得失，仍必從軍事上來作確定的表現，至於政治等各方面的佈置，也無非爲輔助和促進軍事目標的遂行。越是軍力支絀的一方，越急於在軍事以外別闢蹊徑以濟其窮。這一事實，以及年餘以來南北戰塲中無數例證，在在都暴露了日本的支絀，暗示了中日戰事前途的趨勢。</p>

<h3>兩租界遏止漲風　主要物品須標價格　目的在鼓勵店主抑平售價　如查明壟斷操縱卽行訴究</h3>
<p>工部局日前頒　第五二三三號佈吿云、「佈吿全文及主要物品表另附」查各項主要物品、規定必須粘貼標籤及揭示價目表者、其目的在使市民易於鑑別、並選購價格最廉之物品一方面在鼓勵各商店極力抑平售價，以廣招徠、此外兩租界當局擬每星期刊行市內各區物價比較表、以利市民採購、凡此種種、均爲當局改善民生之措置、此種措置、對於改善民生、僅爲一部份、而其眞正解決、尙有　　內地各種限制與捐稅之廢除、與產區供給之能暢運來滬也、</p>
<p>物價高漲　最大原因</p>
<p>大多數市民、對於目前物價之高漲、莫不歸咎於商人　接或間接之居奇，操縱·投機、但平心而論、其眞正原因、初非商人或市政當局所能爲力者、例如一·各種物品、類皆來自內地、該處不特　蒙戰禍、抑且陷於軍事佔領之下、常局所延聘而担任硏究防止商人居奇等情事之艱巨工作者、在目前似已盡力爲之、</p>
<p>主要物品　難定限價</p>
<p>復次、附表所載各種主要物品、大半均屬易於潰腐之物、其斯謂市價者、僅能適用於各該物品由生產者直接轉售與消費者之間、各種物品、如菜蔬等等、其售價在供求之原則下、每日上落靡定、如欲按日規定一種價格、除非每日供給之數量、在開市以前、可以斷定時、實不可能、又如於一星期前規定其價格、則流弊滋多、至若同一物品、規定不同之價格、則又易趨混亂、</p>
<p>與法租界　密切合作</p>
<p>本局於二月二十九日、曾組織一物價統制委員會、就法租界當局所頒行之辦法、硏究公共租界統制物價之辦法、該委員會、曾於三月間向局方建議、謂本局所擬採用統制物價之措置、應盡量與法租界當局所採取者相同、本局嗣於三月十三日頒發布吿、取締米糧及各種必需品之囤積操縱與投機、有不遵守者、一經查覺、即予依法控訴、關於糧食問題、業經愼重研究、並與法租界當局密切合作、所望本局目前所頒佈之各項措置、對於改進本市糧市糧食方面、得有成效、</p>
<p>物價標籤　當予審查</p>
<p>在商人未得充分時間粘貼物價標籤及揭示物價表格以前、各界市民、幸勿向本局警務處或衛生處報吿居奇。投機、及操縱情事關於此類報吿、將來當由委員會予以審查、</p>

<h3>萬國商團年閱禮中　在檢閱台旁的速寫</h3>
<p>五十七年前的昨天，—一八八三年四月十四日—爲上海萬國商團有史以來，第一次的常年檢閱之期。那時候，全隊「官」「兵」兩合，祇共一百七十六人。昨日下午三時，在靜安寺路斜橋總會前，單就走過檢問台的騎。步·輜重等隊而論，人數已在百倍左右。可知SVC的進展，實和上海的歷年繁榮進步，成爲一個正比例呢。</p>
<p>檢閱塲設在靜安寺路斜橋總會前，—卡德路東黃家沙電車站附近—下午二時起，東起跑馬廳，西迄麥特赫司脫路，沿靜安寺路兩面人行道上，站着好幾排人。萬頭攢動，熱鬧得很。在這兩條街地位的距離中，就象徵着上海人口的如何長。厚。而密，比起丹麥，似乎還要叨長一輩哩。—丹麥人口的爲三百八十萬。</p>
<p>捉放曹的唱詞裹，不是有句「見一老丈坐道旁」麽？昨天斜橋總會之前，和對面嗚玉坊左右沿馬路，就排上了許多坐位，男女老少，無中無外，大家實行坐於「道旁」一路。二路雷車，和一路·十四·十五等路公共汽車，在交涌沒有斷絕之前，就在這許多坐着的人中間來往。尤其是公共汽車往往緊靠道旁停駛，有幾個坐在最前一排的小孩子們，因爲身材短小，看上去其高度還比不上那又厚父大的率輪，一個正對着車輸坐的小孩子，衣飾鮮艷，倒成爲一幅絕好的圖案畫。有一位坐在二層公共汽車上的西人，趁着車停未進的當兒，和一位坐在「道旁」的胖太太，高聲大談其天。總之，車子上的人望着兩旁坐在街沿前的人，發生異樣的感覺，而坐在　台上的觀衆，朝着車子裏的人，也不免成爲目光的標的。</p>
<p>檢閱台設在塲上正中馬路口，後面和左右都是看台。標着J字的一個是外交團和工部局董事們的看台。正和檢閱台一樣，基層圍有紅和藍色的綢布，以示隆重。三時正，工部局行將卸任的總董樊克令氏踱上檢閱台，旁邊桅桿上立刻扯起白地紅紋的工部局旗幟。他身體方才立定，那一面旗也剛剛升到桅頂，迎風招展，十分悅目，和樊氏峨冠玄服，非常協調。這時候東望跑馬廳那邊已隱隱的的看見有三匹白馬，得得而來。路上騎馬的西捕，和腰纏紅巾的印巡，一時來往不絕，做個先驅。充任哨務的中西團員，也格外忙碌起來，把人行道上的看客，竭力按捺納入欄着的繩子之內。</p>
<p>樊克令老先生登台之後，接着便是英·美·法·日等駐滬防軍司令六個人上塲，他們態度安閒，笑容滿面，在紅帽雜，白帽軍，黑制服，黃軍裝，各種顏色交織着的一羣中間，大家相互握手，寒暄致意。一時這個丈餘見方的檢閱台上，倒充滿了國際協調的空氣，樊總董儀態萬方，領袖羣倫，一個子先站在前例，潔白無　的領頭，按上一個深褐色的領帶，左襟上還插着一朵紫色的花，和斜刺在外面的一角白色手帕，取得妥協約呼應。大的在他上台後三四分鐘，那三人騎白馬的商團團本部要員，便已呈　在他們的台前。指揮員朗聲喊「向左—看」口令，後隨的馬隊人員，上個個向樊氏行注目禮，執有指揮刀的並行着　刀禮。樊先生把頭上那頂禮帽除下，用右手按在胸前，在大衆拍掌聲中，凝神屏息似的，檢閱大隊人馬經過。</p>
<p>行列從馬隊開始，運輸車殿梢，英軍東旭萊樂隊站在檢閱台對面的路上奏樂，大家精神，都為之一振。自從第一匹馬走過檢閱台，到最後一輛卡車爲止，大的有二十分鐘的時間。馬路中間是負槍穿軍服的人走動着，檢閱台上是上海外國軍政高級人員站立着，大看台和道旁是中西男女老少安坐着。連同停留在兩端，因交涌斷絕而等待在公共汽車，電車，人力車，以及在馬　上行走的站餓斜橋總會附近居家店鋪屋頂上看熱鬧的隨在都是……人，在這二十分鐘的時間中，除了仰首可以望見，一片明晴而帶有淡薄陽光的春之天空外，前後左右，動的靜的，無非表示上海租界中是一僩塞滿了人的所在而已。</p>

<p>賑票療病</p>
<p>豫賑勸捐之初，本擬每冊總出一收票，繼乃分戶掣照，至六七月問，蘇城所收分戶尤多，甚至捐錢二白，亦化作兩戶。每有持錢　來者，不曰捐賑，而曰冒票，怪而問之，曰治病也。治病佘何，將賑票焚灰冲服也。有謂無姓氏之票最騐者，有謂總票最騐者。江震崑新錫金諸邑尤多，浙之嘉興，亦羣相傳信。上月蘇城有崑山張太太專誠雇船到蘇，捐洋一百四十元云。</p>

<h3>上海市塲之自我管理　（下）　—本刊第三次座談會紀錄提要—</h3>
<p>日　期　二十九年三月三十一日下午一時至五時</p>
<p>出席者　（簽名不分先後）</p>
<p>王海波　游資退出商品投機的舞臺之後，物價自然趨於穩定。但不過穩定而已，欲求其抑平，還必需解決來源問題。如要加以管埋，那末須知仰尭先生所說的那些困雞，確是工商界的切實情形。</p>
<p>主　席　現在只聽見產銷合作而不聞產銷與消費者的合作，我覺得管理物價的工作，必需得到三方面合作才行。如農產，要得到農民的合作，事實上本就很難，現在又多了日僞從中的阻隔，所以吏難。但無論如伺，銷售和消費兩方面還是必需合作的。進種辦法誠然很難，但此時此地，非此不足以一致對外。</p>
<p>魏友　　理論上說：產銷和消費者三方面，本屬「共存共榮」的。但事實上，消費者總是被剝削的。</p>
<p>主　席　我所說的消費者，並非限於最後的消費者。比如五金的進口商，批發商，零售商，作爲銷售的方面，而大宗需要五金的建築業，各種加工工業等，就作爲消費者的一面，被此間結成組合，訂立價格協定，甚至分配協定；藉以防止競購，或自由居奇操縱。參與組合的，最好以各該業公會爲單位。</p>
<p>主　席　這種組合一普遍，競購便消减。因此外匯上的壓力，無形中已經减少。至少可使匯市不再時受競爭結款的刺激而波動。</p>
<p>王海波　這種辦法，未免太理想，（一）現社會經濟是自由制度；（二）沒有政治力做後盾，組織決不能普遍。（三）公會本身又只是一塊照牌，在裏面辦公約，最多只是個把書記，他能作得成什麼主？（四）公會中的領袖，事實上就是本業的領袖。實力雄厚，所以一舉一動的利害關係也特大。所定章則，更未必共同遵守。有時運那些領袖們自已都不遵守。（五）各權貨物的用途，事實上複雜異常。所以要使有關係者彼此結成分配協定或價格協定，事實上也屬不可能。</p>
<p>魏友棐　或者把重要的若干貨物的採辦集中於商會之手，或各該業的公會之手。把商會或各該業公會，組織成一個大規模的採辦機關和批發機關。於是對於來價，旣可以作相當的控制；批價當然更可歸於律。零售價也就不會有若何參差。</p>
<p>潘恒動　公會價可能比市價高；那末公會豈不發生虧蝕，</p>
<p>魏友棐　如果市　比公會價實，公會可以不必供給。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　這豈不有囤積居奇之嫌？</p>
<p>魏友棐　事實上，集團採購的成本，總比個別採購低廉。所以公會價事實上不合比市價貴的。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　該項組織的資金之需雄厚。來源應該解決。</p>
<p>魏友棐　　請銀錢業公會合作。</p>
<p>主　席　此時銀錢　公會應明定各行莊，不得再和私人做貨物押款的交易。一切押款交易，須以該項組織做對手。違背此約者應予以嚴厲的制裁。同時各該組織，還可援引銀錢業聯合準備制度與領用同業滙劃證等繳存準備等制度，各自提交準備余於該項組織。以爲向該項組織承批貨物的保證金。此於各該商人的營業上且可稍稍减輕其資金的負擔。因此也將樂於參加了。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　如果市塲外私相授受，應否禁止？</p>
<p>主　席　這倒不必，如有塲外授受，其價應較公會價爲低。假使塲外交易價比公會價貴，則公會的供給力大概發生問題了。這倒是嚴重的。</p>
<p>魏友棐　所以應該做到無限制供給。不過塲外價低於公會價時，還是可以不必供給的。</p>
<p>主　席　所怕的　事人徇私，給他有關係公司以大量團藏的便利，因此而犧牲大衆的利益。所以既能辦到集中採購，便應進一步辦理分配協定。同時還應組織監察機關，請業外的公正人士參加才行。</p>
<p>王海波　這裏我覺得也有三種困難：（一）公會本身缺乏人才。（二）公會操作時發生的損失或利益，將如何處理？（三）商業的盈虧，全仗消息靈通；他們的消息將如何獲得？</p>
<p>主　席　這項組織，事實上巳與加特爾無異。所以各業領袖當然不甘再價身事外，而參加的會員商家也不會自甘落後了。至於操作的結果，虧蝕是不致有的。誠如友棐兄說：布價低於公會價時，公會可以老實不客氣的不供給。這雖有操縱的嫌疑，但祇要他的公會價，確沒有包刮操縱利潤，也就是非法利潤在內。不過，合法的利澗也應該承認的，此種收益，最好是做平衡基金。使他的利益，仍歸還給　衆。至於消息方面，事實上應該比個別經營時易得。而且旣有公會價在領導着市價，所以消息靈遲的關係，也比較的不甚重要了。不過究應從那幾業做起？是値得硏究的。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　當然應先從日用必需品方固先做起。</p>
<p>王海波　但商品的種類是異常複雜的，同一商品的品質也大有上落。所以公會價的規定，事實上尙有困難。因此從那幾業做起？還是値得研究的。我以爲決定時應根據二個原則，（一）可以大量採辦　又合乎大衆需要的。能大量採辦，才能大量供給，使公會價獲得領導市價之權。（二）公會價格規定時，尙須實施標準商品制度，問時又可母須應川技術的選擇者爲宜。所以像米，煤球，麵粉，油，鹽等等，可以先行試辦。這就是說：糧食業，糟坊業，燃料業等等應先試辦</p>
<p>供需調節與自衛措置</p>
<p>供需不平衡，物價政策的效果究屬不能保證的。本市居然算做工業驅，但原料的來源，不是拾日僞手裏流出來的殘餘，便須接受外匯上的重負。而且尙無取給的自由。此又豈僅原料如此，糧食等非工業產品全部也都如此！</p>
<p>潘恒動　囤積是擾亂供需平衡的禍根之一，囤積投機消滅，亦足使供需平衡的可能性增加。</p>
<p>王海波　我覺得游資運用得當，貨物供需關係，也可達到平衡的原則。</p>
<p>魏友棐　這應從糾正本市工業政策上着手。本市工廠的內遷西南，原料問題就不致若何嚴重！</p>
<p>潘恒動　有位朋友最近在大公報上發表一篇題爲簡單的抉　文章，他對於一般人提出的種種困難問題，只給以一個簡單的答復，那就是「抗戰勝利，任伺困難都可迎刃而解」。</p>
<p>主　席　皮之不存，毛將焉附？忍受戰時的一切艱苦，正和每個國民都應負擔戰費同樣是應盡的天職。</p>
<p>潘恒動　節約有利於平衡物價，同時也有動於供需平衡。</p>
<p>王海波　除了發國難財與新　們之外，恐都巴節無可節，約無可約。</p>
<p>主　席　以小資產階級做對象的生活費節約，尙邊値得倡導。暴發戶區不感具趣的。</p>
<p>王海波　以上海而論，就應打破體面的虛榮觀念。外强中乾的朋友，現在犯不着再擺闊。</p>
<p>魏友棐　這可以像廉恥運動一般地提倡。</p>
<p>主　席　五四運動以後，各地頗多儉德會，進德會等等人格修養與生活合理化的組織，現在應該加以復活。除生活費約之外，同時還値得倡導原料節約，代用品的研究與提倡。原料節約與糾正工業政策有密切關係。比如在上海辦絲廠，不單是和「華中蠶絲公司」做生意，事實上且屬死路一條。不如改造其機器設備，轉營其他生產。</p>
<p>魏友棐　最好還是遷入浙西續東以至成都等地。否則，原料仍屬問題。</p>
<p>主　席　從平衛國際收支與富裕民生國力着眼，國貨第一主義，仍應堅決維持。不過在對手控制下的國產，事實上已變了質。所以當米風潮發生之初，本刋就提倡聯合購買洋米，這不單是粉碎對方的壟斷，打擊他們的從中掠奪，削减他們吸收法斃以搗亂外滙的企圖，事實上且爲疏通來源課題中唯一可能的辦法。但一般人的所謂疏通來源云云，總是想以日僞做疏通的對手。其實這種談判，正是對手所希望舉行的。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　這會增大滙市的負擔。王海波游資如得到合理的出路而從滙市退出，這種負擔就算不了一回事。</p>
<p>主　席　我的意思是國貨洋貨相濟主義，輸入洋貨是手段，獲得國貸是目的。當去冬米價暴貴中，租界內居民皆有寗吃洋米的決心；而且確在粉紛訂購洋米，淪陷國內的米產却也同時源源運滬了。至於棉花，也何會不如此？但絲萊却不然，因為國外並無供給鮮　的市塲；惟有仰給淪陷區之一途。所以絲價暴漲的程度，特別兇。因此在料正上海工業政策下，絲廠恐只有改行是最有利的辦法罷！　（下略）</p>
<h3>日本之黑市塲物價</h3>
<p>— 予</p>
<p>三十餘月來之侵華戰爭，早使日本經濟爲之筋疲力盡，無論其政府如何　行暴力統制，並封鎖其新聞，使其國民間之苦痛不能外洩，然以其恐慌業已萬分嚴重，掩無可掩，故其雜誌報章，邇來亦時有悲痛之呼聲洩漏，如其物價市塲，由於實施物價統制與配給統制故，早有黑市塲發生；但向被禁止發表，然讀本年二月二十一日出版之東京經濟家雜誌，赫然有若干種物品之黑市價格揭載，此非其統制新聞者之疏忽，想以該誌所載者尙較實情爲輕，雖然，試以與其公定價格比較，則已有天壤之別，有如次表（單位日圓）</p>
<h3>介紹公信通用新式帳表</h3>
<p>— 潘序倫</p>
<p>我國工商事業應用新式會計制度奢，　率以大規模之廠商爲限，較小規模之廠商，類多因循舊習，沿用舊制。新式會計制度之優點，廠商　局非不知之，知之而仍價用舊制，其間障碍，不外二點，人材之難求一也，制度設計與帳薄印刷之靡費二也。所謂人村之難求者，廠商冀圖改制，延攬專材，若於舊式商習未盡嫻習者，滋多窒礙。至若中式帳薄，價格較　，且同一格式之帳簿，往往可以應用於多種用途，廠商一年應用帳簿二十本，所費不過四五十元。改用新式帳簿，規劃格式，既非盡人所能爲，而規劃既定，一二十册帳薄之印制費用，往往在一二百元以上，較之沿用舊制者，不便滋多矣。</p>
<p>爲補救以上兩種困難計，我會計界人會多所努力。本人所設立價會計補習學校，對於工商業職員業餘修習會計者或不無便利之處。四五年來徐永祚氏提倡改良中式簿記，就工商業規模之大小，營業種類之不同，擬定數種標準制度，於是舊式工商業會計制度之規劃工作，即大爲减省。徐氏　就擬定制度中各種帳薄格式，印爲帳簿若干種，於是工商業之帳薄即得有集中供應，而各業之帳薄費用於以减輕。特徐氏所定制度，尙爲改良中式，而非完全西式，是以供應及於一方，而未普及於應用西式制度之事業也。</p>
<p>今年，上海公信會計師事務所設計「通用新式帳表」，集中印製，　量供應，於是事業界應用西式帳薄者，亦遂得極大之便利。作者翻閱該所帳表樣本，見凡各業　用憑單（傳票），收據，日記，現金，分類等薄，各備數式，設計殊為完善。各業之應用新式會計制度者，既得就該所所編「應用公信通用新式帳表概說」，獲悉會計制度之系統，因而節雀規劃制度之勞。而所用帳表，得以低廉之價格購買，可不必特別印製，以致費去大量印刷費用。工商界得此便利，則新式會計何種障碍存其間。至由而易舉之工作，不復有何種障碍存其間。至由是而於我國工商業會計改革一點所引起之推進作用，自吏爲作者所樂見也。</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>時代的夫婦們</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科　畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>應知誤用肉體的危害</p>
<p>欲在婚後擭得人生的幸福，及產生子女以繁衍後嗣者，第一問題，就是要看身體的是否健全，本來男女的結合，爲的是愛的交流，此愛情的開發，當然需要健全的生殖機能，方有幸福的可言。</p>
<p>所以男女生殖工作，並非可恥的事，假使我們都去求以完全脫離肉體爲終結的理想，那麽不久我們就會看到全人類的絕種。人終究是生物之一，生物界天然有兩大慾望，一是食慾，二是生殖慾，這兩大慾望，吾人應該領衛生原理加以滿足，如誤用肉體，或愚昧無知而創傷了有關幸福的性機能，那眞不堪設想了。</p>
<p>從夫婦生活裹，就可以見得性機能健全的重要性，它不單生出新生命來，並且由它的媒介，兩性互愛五助，奠定愛情的基礎，增加精神上的了解，一切快樂的來源，部可在健全的生殖機能中取之不盡，用之不竭，不過喪失了此生殖機能的健康，其所得適得其反。</p>
<p>所以男女間的愛情在雙方性的接觸後就會自然產生，男子除完全陰痿外，都可充分享受，女子則不然，其所受的生殖樂趣，權操自丈夫，若碰到丈夫身體衰弱，早洩陰痿，發育不全則甜蜜的夢就要消逝了</p>
<p>這種早洩與衰弱毛病，實不宜放任不治，至於釀成此種疾病的原因，除自凟過度結婚過早之外，厥屬婚後縱慾與荒淫而來，此時應積極投以雄壯動物睪九精質製劑男用「補體康」，方可恢復原來的健康生理。蓋「補體康」爲德國生理學家梅倫博士所發明，除雄壯動物之睪丸精質爲主要成分外，並有補腦之燐質，補血之鐵質，及補骨的鈣質摻入，故功能促進每個細胞的繁榮，培補全身，治早洩陰痰，發育短小最爲對症，其女用「補體康」功能調經種子，其效如神。</p>
<h3>對於新淋藥之解釋</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>現代醫藥，乃科學的醫藥，一切均須（一）科學爲根據，爲今日市上淋藥，多如過江之鯉，往往巧立名目，必標其名稱爲新藥，以爲街奇求售，結果不但使病家徒然虛費金錢，而且還要貽誤病機，這因爲淋病之治療，不論新舊，總以能根本解決淋病之病原　爲目的，因爲病家之目的，在於解除他們之痛苦。而不管其藥之新舊與否。例如梅毒的特效藥「六〇六」發明已數十年，至今依然爲治梅藥中之首領，不論現在新出品之治梅藥如何新法，總難及到「六〇六」。吾人現在亦可用同一理由，說明「克淋儂」（中英有售）一藥爲淋病內服藥中之權威，蓋「克淋儂」爲德國彼德博士竭三十餘年之心血，經過無數次之失敗，無數次之改良，試驗結果，終得最後之成功，而發明『克淋儂』藥，至已歷年所，其在治淋藥中之地位，一如治梅藥中之六〇六光芒萬丈，歷久彌新，以實際功效，打倒一切虛僞的新出雜牌劣藥。舉凡急性初起之淋濁，及慢性　年之淋濁祗須服用『克淋儂』一藥，在四小時內，即見卓効，因「克淋儂」之抗淋殺菌功效，隨血液之循流，直達病灶，抗殺淋菌，與其他一般雜牌新出劣藥，一入消化器，即行排泄於外，徒然刺激胃腸與治療淋病上毫不相干。故我們醫學專家之立塲而言，最新之淋藥，惟以「克淋儂」足以當之而無愧，其他所謂新藥，皆不過是口頭上之名詞而巳。</p>
<h3>陰萎與子嗣關係</h3>
<p>— 德國號學博士鄭</p>
<p>患者鄒××，浙江嘉善人，住本埠新垃圾橋阿拉白司脫路永康里（主訴）——未人年廿九歲，因結婚過早，房事過動，婚後除生一女夭逝外，迄今結婚十三年，尙未生育，本人身患遺精滑精，陰痿，勃起力軟弱，且排尿後見粘稠性分泌物流出，近年身體愈弱，精神不振，夫婦聞愛情不良，乞爲冶療云云。（治愈經過）——攝護腺按摩，每日爲之電療十五分鐘，睡前冷水摩擦局部，同時服「耐而斯遺精片」三片以止遺精，在日間分晨午晚三次投以雄壯動物睪丸精質大補劑男用「補體康」以滋陰補腎，共計服藥兩月，電療六十五次，冷水按摩持之恒久，上述衰弱之象，逐一消失，晨起精神充足，食慾亢進，生殖器勃起堅强，其間曾同房兩次，據云完全恢復生殖之機能矣。上月鄒君介紹其友來所診治，據云：其夫人己懷孕五月矣，並致謝忱。</p>
<h3>癆病的治騐例</h3>

<p>患者錢雪良，松江人，現年四十一歲（自訴）本人體質素弱，好酒，前年冬月，適友人喜宴，酒醉而回，時値夜深，感受寒胃，由是咳嗽不絕，至去春，濃痰甚多，胸感刺痛，雖經醫治絕無效騐，去秋痰中忽有血點發現，入夜盜汗淋淋，始來余處治療，（治騐經過）余觀錢君面色蒼白，骨瘦如柴，身發高熱，以X光檢查，發現右肺葉有銀錢大之空洞，乃囑其忌食酒類攝富有滋養的食物，並在家靜養，投以「補肺拿爾」以彌補空洞，二個月後咳嗽已治，胸痛盜汗亦無，服至今，諸症全消，血痰已無發現，健康恢復矣。</p>
<p>淋病談藪</p>
<h3>淋毒性膀胱炎之特治</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋毒性膀胱炎，爲淋病患者於急性淋時或慢性淋時，被一種不良之拙劣手術，行局部洗滌法，或於慢性淋時，忍尿行房，凡此皆能使淋菌逆竄內部膀胱，患者少腹作痛，尿意頻數，尿液溷濁，甚至尿中混有血液。如此日復一日，病毒甚熾，如不及早治療，結果必致淋毒的原菌，更進一步，上竄腎　，而成淋毒性腎盂炎，如此病勢更見嚴重。挽救益不可不迅速，因爲淋毒之勢蔓延日甚，不免有變症蜂起之可慮也。惟關於此等療法，不能不審愼從事。如其再用一般局部療法，或透膜殺菌療法，更不濟事，不免有一誤再誤之嫌。亟宜愼之。</p>
<p>要之，淋毒性膀胱炎一症，治療愈速愈佳。余對於淋毒性膀胱炎之治療，先用科學方法，檢查病灶所在，診斷其病灶所在地後，再用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，（中英有售）及用德國靜電療法，X線電療法等交相爲用，如此急性淋時之膀胱炎，可在二星期中治愈，如其已成慢性膀胱炎，則三四星期，亦絕對可以治愈。余於淋病之治療，巳有二十年之經騐，或投以內服藥，或應用手術，或用電療，均能隨症而治，無不得心應手，迅速取效。淋毒膀胱炎經過上述治法後，短期內其症狀即能迅速减輕以至根治，絕無失敗之例　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角，並送價値一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>紹興的交通工具</h3>
<p>— 剛</p>
<p>脣　齒相依的蕭紹，自從蕭山淪陷後，紹興不免有點影響，雖然市面曾一度冷靜，可是現在又恢復了繁榮，在這裏讓我來談談關於紹興的行。</p>
<p>紹興河流很多，所以船隻航行也特別發展，大戶人家總備有船隻，好像上海的小包車，種田人家至少自己也有一隻小船，此外還有埠船，往來城內城外，有一定的路綫與停泊處，祇要化幾個銅板，就可搭趁，因為價廉而便利，所以趁客也不少。</p>
<p>埠船很大，裏面放着一排排長凳，沒有頭二等之分，搖船的至少有二個，船頭上挿着一塊木板，板上寫的是直訖點及經過停留的地方，這種船大約都從鄕下開來，劉下午再開回去，下午的停開，有的仍搖到城裏來，不過到傍晚總搖回去了，有的因為路遠所以要背　，每到上午九十點鍾，城門口有時還擠得不通，他們稱為「埠船上市」，當船開行時，船老大手持小鑼，一面敲，一面叫，這樣要到搖遠了才漸漸歇下來。</p>
<p>除了埠船還有一種「鑒槳船」，這種船體積很小，有二枝槳，一用手划，一用脚　，祇有三五個人好坐，船裏面是一張草蓆，乘容就坐在蓆上，搖船的手划脚推，非常輕快，因為埠船有時間性，所以脫了班總乘這種小船，又因為是輕快，一般有急事的人也都需要，不過在風大河闊的時候是不過用。</p>
<p>至於黃包車紹興也很多，車槓上都裝着鈴，假使你在路上走，嘈雜的鈴聲總會使得你生厭，因為河多，橋也不少，而且很高，車子過橋時，車夫有時間你要不要下車，為了穩當，我們總是下車過橋。</p>
<p>汽車在紹興城裏不很多，這也許是馬路少橋多的緣故，不過比之往昔，已增加許多了。</p>
<p>因為環境的關係，在紹興船隻與人力車就做了重要的交通工具，尤其是船隻。</p>
<h3>染衣服</h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>衣　服　舊後，托染衣店染上心愛的顏色，便等於件新的了。至於染衣的種種，並非店外人所熟悉了。</p>
<p>染衣店用的顏料，大多向下內門或德孚購買的。其種類和用途如下：</p>
<p>（一）直接性（Direct　Uoionr）可染棉毛絲等織物。</p>
<p>（二）硫化性（Sulphur　Colour）可染棉織物。</p>
<p>（三）酸性　（Basie　Colour）可染毛絲織物。</p>
<p>（四）鹼性（Basie　Colour）可染毛棉絲織物。</p>
<p>（五）鋊性（Chromc　Colour）可染毛織物。</p>
<p>（六）勿脫色（Vat　Colour）可染毛織物。</p>
<p>其中以勿脫色最好，用這種顏料的決不會落色，像市上的陰丹士林布，克立發是也。</p>
<p>關於染衣的方法，普通先把衣服浸在配好的顏料液體中，然後加以定量的硫酸，醋酸和食鹽三種助染品；這樣在四十度的溫度下染半小時左右，最後用溫水沖洗烘乾便成了。</p>
<p>可是，在內工作者，不但飽受臭味，同時手臉也常常容易被濺傷。</p>

<p>這幾天萵苣很多了；價錢還算便宜，五分輔幣，也可買到小小的一把。你把上段切了斜塊子，和着竹筍塊子，用醬麻油合在一起拌了吃，味道淸篙得很，吃了油膩把它下酒和佐粥，是十分相宜的。萵苣的葉子有一股淸香，可把它和豆腐一同紅燒，不但經濟，幷且很可口。你要是不喜萵拌竹筍，那麼將它們切了片子，紅燒豆腐，再加此蝦子在內，也是一樣好菜。至於別開生面的吃法，可將猪肉和竹筍切了丁，多用一些萵苣葉，做爛飯吃，又鮮又香又腴美，眞可使人吃了開胃，而且別的菜也可省一些下來，豈非一舉兩得，大家何妨嘗試一下呢。</p>

<h3>建築中的貴陽新住宅區</h3>
<p>— 荊生</p>
<p>被　稱為山國的貴陽，地方本來就並不怎麼大，自從全面抗戰的　幕展開之後，貴陽便屹然成為西南重鎭，人口　然增加四十幾倍，於是發生了「住」的困難的問題；而經過了日機幾度的大轟炸，房屋　壞了許多，這住的大轟炸，房屋　壞了許多，這住的問題，就愈加嚴重了。</p>
<p>現在貴陽當局，除了儘量把人口向別地方疏　以外，還計劃把南明河的風景區建築為住宅區。計劃中的南明河住宅區，在貴陽城東郊黔靈山的西南麗有南明河環流如　，地方同城區不相上下，面積達一萬三千九百市方，分為一百四十戶。建築費規定為　十三萬元，完全從出實地面以收入撥給，不足時再由政府予以補助。</p>
<p>住宅區不許有戲院酒店飯館的開　，打算造成一個整潔寗　合乎理想的新村。除中心地點開闢中央公園以供住民遊息外，並利用黔靈山的石料，南明河的細沙和山地裏的木材，建築小菜場，郵政局，圖書館，小學校等公共場所；至於水電碼頭，街車等公用事業，也都有完善的規則，應有盡有，盡善盡美。</p>
<p>這個住宅區已經在二十七年的五月開始建築，大約今年秋天，可以全部完成，那時古老的貴陽，按上了新裝，將另有一番新興的氣象了。</p>
<h3>戰地所應淸除之「跳蚤」　捷於劍俠猛於獅</h3>
<p>— 中志</p>
<p>人　生在　，無往不是競爭，二十五前發生之歐戰，參加者有四十二種民族，　延達四年之久，歐洲大陸中心之城市，跳蚤壁虱，小醜跳梁，隨軍隊所至之地而猖獗為患，勢同星火之燎原，直有類乎流行病之遞相傳染。說者謂害與害怕蟲為人羣之大敵，自有史以來，下迨今日，人羣與害蟲之爭，無時或息。蟲之生殖，至蕃且速，茍不互相呑噬，則如數枚蟲子之遺留，隔一兩年以後，經過萬子萬孫倍級數之推衍與散布，直可滿蓋大西洋，偶遇世界與大戰而人類相戕，害蟲因無人力之提防，其必乘肆威，自為勢所必至。第二屆歐戰之開端在秋季，歐洲大陸戰禍波及之廣速，今不如昔，二十五年前之蟲患，深望其不再見於今。然如我國，物質文明之發達，不逮彼歐，大戰期蟲患之肅淸，應共防疫問題，同為當務之急。查害蟲中，抵抗力最頑强者惟跳蚤，市上發售『蠅殺倒』等除蟲粉，每不足以禦跳蚤。歐洲有跳蚤專家，嘗謂『跳蚤不擇地而極易存活，尤喜攢　女子之身，蚤具六腿，其兩後腿近腹處，藏有發音之器官，常能如草蟲之振翅而鳴，特鳴聲低弱，吾人不容察及，僅蚤類可得聞之。』</p>
<p>蚤目盲而不良於視，乃如蜜蜂之知辦別光明與黑暗，而其習性，只喜向暗處進。西方新式家庭，室內光綫充足，甚便防止蚤類之潛藏。蚤不善爬而善跳，渺小一微蟲，可一跳而遠達三十公分（約三分之一公尺）乃至五十公分（半公尺）以外，又可一跳而及十公分CM之高。如我運動界遠跳名家，能如蚤之善跳者，則竟可　滬杭路南站離地一跳，而落入上海公共租界之跑馬場，是則蚤之善跳，直駕劍俠而上之。</p>
<p>不獨此也，蚤雖忌冷忌乾而却耐久餓，如當溫曖之天，而居潮濕之地，直可枵腹一年之久而不死。特其不食滿一年之餓蚤。偶　人膚，兇猛類餓吼之獅，可因一口狂吸，而攝取半個立方公壓之人血，假令不加驚攏或驅際，且可釘住二十分鍾以上，至兩小時為止。</p>
<p>人之困於跳蚤者，捕之旣難捕而殺之則尤難，捕蚤之善法，或則迅按癢處而盡力亂搓，或用沾濕之手，　準捫住。其經捕之蚤，逈非一指之揑所能斃，如恐倉卒間再被逃脫，宜即溺諸水中，惟不可如非洲熱帶土人之　人齒尖以咬死，因恐誤咬波及人身之犬蚤，而染犬腸中之蛔蟲病也。蚤之　類至繁夥，人蚤Pulex　irritans而外，尙有沙蚤犬蚤貓蚤猴蚤鷄蚤鼠蚤以及刺蝟，莫不　育於地面，惟平與馬　蚤，常遮馬背之毯，且可憑馬臊氣以辟蚤。</p>
<p>蚤之禍根，最難剷絕，幼蟲率居地板裂縫之中，賴潮濕之助以潛行發育，近年西人住宅，紛置暖氣周流於全室之中央播熱器，（俗名暖氣管），經冬涉春，地板變乾，可於不知覺之中，絕蚤類繁滋之路。其尤妙者，西人住宅之地板，大抵不假水洗而用油擦，且在地板之上蓋油氈，油氈之上又舖厚毯，凡此設施，隨物質文明之進步以俱新，皆不啻與蚤類為敵。其最精美之住宅，營浴室而　澡益勤，蚤類豈有不絕跡者。</p>
<p>至若我國，舖地毯與裝中央播熱器，財力或有所未逮，居家而求永除蚤患，不妨即向西藥肆，購取石炭酸carbolic　acid，（石炭酸有毒，勿以少許石炭酸，拼合二十　石炭酸之淸水，（謂即五與一百之比，使成乳白色而帶烈臭之石炭酸溶液，（俗名臭藥水，）取以傾洗地板，深液滲人地板裂縫中而幼蟲患斃，跳蚤之來路，遂告肅淸，不僅居家者高枕無憂，可以加大治事之精神而增進勤工效率。他如介乎可見不可見之病源末子mite蟲，以及小於末子蟲之鼠疫桿菌等等，凡因依附於蚤身，而嫁禍於人類者，盡可一舉而絕滅之，誠要圖也。</p>

<h3>你希望你的商店發達嗎？</h3>
<p>— 權</p>
<p>美國曾有一家公司，老闆特斥資替僱員學習「笑」，這在中國人看來，這個老闆是多麼愚蠢，然而結果該公司的營業却增進百分之十分。</p>
<p>這也許是很奇怪的，但是，無足為奇，這是斥資為僱員着想的應得的收穫啊！不過中國近見的商人不易發覺罷了。現在中國的公司商讓裏的職員，知識程度又低，待遇又菲溥，老闆又處處不為僱員着想，其物質精神上所受的痛苦交迫，其結果必促成苦悶，暴躁，…而影響營業。</p>
<p>各公司商店的老闆們！你希望你的業務發達嗎？這眞是一個不容忽視的大問題啊！</p>
<p>待遇的改良，可以促成僱員對家務的安心而對業務專心，並且可以免除舞弊揩油。老闆對僱員的關心與注意，必促起僱員對業務的熱心。如果老闆能更替僱員增進知識，其結果非惟使僱員感激，並且可以帮助業務。所費極微，收穫至大，只要你有遠見，你的業務立刻會發達起來的。</p>
<p>你希望你的商店發達嗎？你的僱員確是你成功的有力的帮助者啊！注意你的僱員，關心你的僱員，帮助你的僱員，優待你的僱員，我相信，你一定會成功！</p>
<h3>拯救他們脫離苦海</h3>
<p>— 不仁</p>
<p>希望籌設戒煙專科醫院</p>
<p>我有一位親戚，因患病染上了惡嗜好，後來病愈之後，他非常後悔這新的「病魔」不能脫身，最近他下了決心，將惡嗜好戒絕，但是他的家境並不富裕，剬且是個薪給階級，自然不能進比較可靠的醫院去求戒，於是他祇偷偷地在報章的角落裏去找尋「保戒鴉片」，「十天斷癮」的便宜醫生。</p>
<p>到現在將近三個月，他已經換過三個醫生。前面兩個的戒法，幾乎使他又病倒了；後面一個呢；雖然上點沒有苦痛，但是吃藥水的時間與吸烟相等，他懷疑着那藥水不過是「代替品」，不能把他的嗜好戒絕，因之，他已陷入了非常痛苦的境地。</p>
<p>在抗戰時期，在毒化政策的蔓延下，沉淪在苦海中的人們，都應立即覺醒，把惡嗜好戒除，但像我的親戚那樣的人，他們旣沒有多餘的錢請可靠的醫生，又要繼續着工作來維持生活，於是在暗中摸索着，欲求脫離苦海而不得。</p>
<p>所以我以為各個較大的醫院應該負起這重大的責任，他們應該添設專門戒烟科，為那此可憐的人們服務；除收回藥本外，一切手續費都應免除。對於赤貧者，則每個醫院規定若干免費名額，為之戒除。如能特設一個戒烟醫院，當然是更好；至於經費，不妨向各界募集。</p>
<p>其次，對於那些不負責任的醫生，及一切投機的「戒烟藥水」之類，兩租界當局應隨時注意，予以調查及化騐，如果發現上述情形，予以嚴重處罰。</p>
<h3>從錫箔灰想起</h3>
<p>— 鼎</p>
<p>前天陰曆二月三十日，在一家門口看見堆着錫箔灰，於是我想起了一個故事：</p>
<p>「從前英國有位大富翁，生了一種怪僻，並且成為習慣，就是每天都要親自燒去一張金磅票。」</p>
<p>你們會恐怕他有點精神病嗎？我也是這麼想，不過仔細一想，他與燒錫箔並無甚差別，不過是直接與間接的不同罷了；幸好這些時代輪下的落伍已逐漸減泊了，但却另有種世以時髦且普遍的香烟，代而興起，不論應酬敬客，弄得家庭中，交際場，甚至學校裏，都變成烏煙瘴氣；而偏偏有人要吸，並且吸的人日多一日。我不知道它有什麼好處，祇是在報紙上看到什麼「淸香撲鼻」，「精神倍增」，「工作加速」等一類的廣告，其實日常聽醫生告訴我們的，書本上見到的，都是與此相反用意的勸說和警告，因之我分不出這與燒錫箔有什麼不同的地方。</p>
<p>我希望吸香烟的人，不要以為我的設想太離奇，請仔細想一想，是否毫無得益而有害的，那麼請你由減少枝數以至於不吸，則對個人的健康，皆有裨益。一人之量雖微，羣衆之力則宏，這於人於已都有利無損的事，讀者中有吸香烟者，請三復思之。</p>
<h3>耶穌與城市　（三）</h3>
<p>（五）耶穌為城市哭，耶穌走近城脚下，還看出許多別的罪惡，不貧民區傷心痛哭起來，衆人正大聲喊着和撒拿，聽着耶穌哭，乃住口不喊了。耶穌的哭。不僅是志士見了本國將要滅亡的哭，乃是救世主，見了他來救贖的選民自趨敗亡而痛哭。「他來到的日子，你們不知道。」耶穌來救他們，但他們却拒絕接受。耶穌帶給他們的福音。給他們樹立榜樣，這一切他們都不在意，反加藐視。所以，耶穌哭了。我們現在看見城市罪惡，許多人行屍走肉，不知正邪是非，是要為他們放聲一哭。（六）趕快補救，耶穌痛哭之後，還覺不够，馬上前去援救。他走進聖殿，把那些聖殿作賊　的人。盡行趕出。我們見一罪惡，別是痛哭不够，要馬上設法挽救。第一步工夫，要淸除上帝的敎會，「讓審判，始於神的殿，」因為敎會是救恩之流，如受罪惡阻塞，則救人生命活水，便無從暢流。凡照自憶意見講道；在主日是聖人，在平日則妄為；在主日學敎人，在辦公室起誓；在主日頌贊上帝，在平日痛駡貧窮人；當人面前做正經，背人面無所不為；這一切的人，如耶穌看見了，都是要趕走的。（七）不住的敎訓人，耶穌哭了之後，在城中天天敎訓人。城市罪惡，　世俗救法如前面所說的一種，仍不濟事，還得從犧牲方面努力。換一句話就是說，城市需要敎育，法律，等等，更需要有變化人的力量的神道。所以，我們要傚法耶穌，天天宣揚聖道。不要主日講道，平日則否，要天天如當。個個基督徒，皆成活的證言，這樣做下去，城市必有改良的一日。（完）　如欲詳細詢問請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>大家見了邵慧華那種樣子，不免哄笑起來，說：眞是一個淘氣的女孩子。瞿無變道：『朱醫師所說的話，我很相信。現在我們報館裏有位副輯長，他會經當過戰地新聞的記者。在戰地荒村寒舍，就是這樣的得到新聞。有一架收音機，和一具油印機，便可以把當天新聞，播散到了大衆了。不過出入在槍林彈雨之中，過着軍隊一樣的生活，艱苦是艱苦是艱苦的呀！這和現在眞是不同了，現在當新聞記者的，無論是內勤勞上點，到底在社會上是養尊處優的呢。朱愛人道：人家說：報館是靠廣告，不以靠發行。我們不辦報，於新聞事業，全部外行，不知這話可確實否？』瞿無變笑道：『從前或者有這種現象，現在却不如此，報紙還是靠發行。就是當時靠廣告的時代，也是間接靠發行，試想你銷數太少的報紙，還有誰來登你的廣告嗎？就是像我們報館裏，在發行上雖不能獲得多少盈餘，然而也不至於虧本。這也有幾個緣故；第一，是紙價的便宜。十餘年前，中國的報紙是外國貨，在外滙，運費上，都不免吃虧。此刻我們中國的造紙公司，大小已有好幾十家，還有專造紙業的公司，也有六七家。本來中國森林旣富，水利亦便，正是造紙的好地方，為什麼自己不開發呢？旣是用了本國造紙公司的紙，當然這費也就省了不少，而況有幾家大報館，都與造紙公司有合作關係的呢。第二，是紙張的規定。現在第一大報，至多是出四大張。照了現在中國工商業的繁榮，文化的發達，便是每天出十大張出可以。因為工商業的繁榮，便昌廣告多，而文化的發達，不愁報紙上材料少。然而日報是人家天天看的，要省去人家的精神不貴多。還有那些廣告，也限定只能占紙面十分之四，廣告費自然也比從前加了好幾倍了。第三，是公家與報館以種種的便利。似郵運費的低廉，電報電話費的減免對於報紙是一國文化宣傳事業，處處加以優惠，這筆費用也比從前減去不少。就那幾種湊起來說，便是紙價廉，紙張少，耗費省，在發行上可以不至於虧本了。而況廣告雖只許占紙面十分之四，還是一筆鉅大收入呀！』　（二六三）</p>
<p>編輯先生！希望這篇文字能在春秋一上發表，我想除了少數自願戕害自己生命的，像我的親戚那樣的一定佔着最大多數，我們應為他們呼號，拯救他們脫離苦海！</p>

<h3>Northeastern Representatives to Attend the Political Council</h3>
<p>Chongqing today's news, according to a leaflet issued by the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army Headquarters, the three northeastern provinces will send representatives to attend the National Political Council to be held in November this year. The leaflet also stated that since the National Government of Chongqing announced the convening of the National Political Council to consider the constitution last year, elections in various regions of the three northeastern provinces have been underway. Representatives from the three northeastern provinces will make a long journey to Chongqing as soon as they learn the exact date of the next meeting. This leaflet was addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Lin Sen, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, and the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party. The leaflet also strongly stated that the 30 million people of Northeast China support the National Government and oppose the puppet organization. The leaflet actively advocated the unity of the Chinese people, saying that unity leads to victory and division leads to failure. The people of the whole country should not forget the suffering of the 30 million people of Northeast China and should always support the anti-Japanese struggle of the people of Northeast China.

<h3>Tianjin Silver Deposit Issue: Hope for Resolution</h3>
<p>Chongqing, reliable foreign sources here anticipate that the Tianjin silver deposit issue can be resolved soon. However, there has been no official statement from the Chinese and British authorities regarding this matter to date. It is rumored that after the British side put forward conditions for a resolution, the Chinese and British authorities immediately began negotiations in Chongqing. However, this proposal was not accepted by the Chinese side. Several weeks later, the Chinese authorities put forward a counterproposal, which was discussed by the British and Japanese authorities in Tokyo. It is now heard that the venue for negotiations has been moved back to Chongqing. It is said that during the negotiations, the Chinese authorities expressed great understanding for the difficulties currently experienced by the United Kingdom in Tianjin. This reasonable attitude of the Chinese government has created a good impression among the British. The Tianjin silver deposit issue is related to other third countries, so the British side has kept the American and French governments informed of the progress of the negotiations in Chongqing and Tokyo. At present, everyone's attention is focused on whether the Japanese side will lift the blockade of the Tianjin concession after the negotiations are successfully concluded, as it is rumored that the Japanese side has made this promise. This can also test whether the silver deposit dispute is the real reason for the blockade of the concession, or merely an excuse for the Japanese side's actions. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Kong, Sun, and Others Initiate Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>Chongqing, the two music broadcasts made by the Chinese side to the United States and the Soviet Union last month have been highly praised by people in those countries. However, China still lacks a fully organized and trained symphony orchestra to meet this need. Vice President Kong and President Sun, recognizing this, yesterday gathered the heads of the American, Chinese-British, Chinese-German, Chinese-Soviet, Chinese-French, Belgian-Swiss, Chinese-Burmese, and other cultural associations, the National Diplomacy Association, the Chinese Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League, the Lishi Society, and the International Publicity Office to discuss initiating the organization of the China Symphony Orchestra.

<h3>One Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>The spokesman for the Chongqing Military Commission stated that after Suiyuan West and Guinan, the brave soldiers of Northern Jiangxi have achieved another great victory in the past week, creating unprecedented results. The other fronts have also repeatedly reported victories, and the brave Chinese Air Force has continued to bomb Yueyang fiercely, inflicting unlimited blows on the Japanese. The important war situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi: Since last week, the Japanese army began to stir, and China simultaneously launched a full-scale attack. The Japanese then breached the dikes south of Nanchang, hoping to prevent the Chinese advance. The main forces of the Chinese routes mobilized to attack the periphery of Nanchang, recapturing more than 20 important villages and towns in one fell swoop within two days. On the 8th and 9th, they recaptured the two major strongholds of Fengxin and Jing'an, surrounded Anyi, and the remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated towards Nanchang. The Chinese army bravely pursued, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. By the evening of the 12th, all the strongholds on the east side of Nanchang, Wuxi and Xiebu, the south side of Xianghua, and the west side of Xishan Wanshou Palace had been recaptured. Wanjia Village on the north side was also under fierce attack by the Chinese. After being surrounded on all sides, the Japanese were unable to advance or retreat, and their casualties reached more than 2,000 in recent days. They continued to strengthen their fortifications and engage in a stubborn defense. The victorious Chinese forces are gathering and shrinking the encirclement to annihilate them.</p>
<p>Guinan: The Japanese, after being severely defeated twice by the Chinese army, which surrounded and fiercely attacked them from the east and west sides of the Yulin Road, have recently gathered more than 5,000 remnant troops and, with the combined forces of land and air, advanced westward along both banks of the Zuojiang River from Nanning for the third time. The Japanese troops on the south bank crossed the Zuojiang River, and the Japanese troops on the north bank crossed the Qianjiang River, advancing blindly at risk. The Chinese army had made predetermined deployments. On one side, a large force first crossed the Zuojiang River and advanced behind the Japanese troops. On the other side, the Japanese were lured deeper into the valley area around Tongzheng County. Starting from the 8th, a heroic annihilation battle was launched on the southeast, northwest, southwest, and northwest sides of Tongzheng County and the southeast, southwest, and northwest sides of Zuojiang County. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese army completely collapsed. That night, the two places of Tongzheng and Zuojiang County were completely recaptured. Less than 3,000 of the surviving Japanese troops were intercepted and severely killed along the way, and their losses were even greater. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and has approached the outskirts of Nanning.</p>
<p>Eastern Jin: The Chinese army, which had just launched an attack on Changzi and Jishan, fought fiercely for three days and nights. The Japanese troops retreated into the city and are being encircled and annihilated. The Japanese in Xinjiang, Wenxi, Anyi, Yicheng, Quwo, and other places are still being besieged, and their casualties are extremely high. In Anyi and Xinjiang alone, more than 1,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated. After being recaptured, the Chinese army in Lin County, Western Jin, took advantage of the victory to attack and continued to recapture the strongholds of Fangshan and Qikou, killing more than 1,200 Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Northern Henan: The Japanese troops besieged in Qinyang were fiercely attacked by the Chinese on the 10th and forced to reach the city walls, killing more than 500 Japanese troops. The Japanese continued to reinforce and attempted to defend to the death. Another Chinese army has been fiercely attacking for days.</p>
<p>Northern Hubei: In Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Yingcheng, and other places, a unit has approached the outskirts of Yingcheng. The Japanese barracks and warehouses were burned down. The Chinese army in Eastern Hubei has been advancing towards the outskirts of Hankou for days, has approached Macheng, and has annihilated more than a thousand Japanese troops. It is currently engaged in a fierce battle with more than 2,000 Japanese troops who are reinforcing and counterattacking.</p>
<p>Northern Hunan: The Chinese army attacking the outskirts of Yueyang once occupied Yunxi Railway Station at dawn on the 10th and rushed into Yanglousi Railway Station on the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>Southern Hebei: Fierce battles have taken place in Daming, Linzhang, Wangguanying, Rizhao in Eastern Shandong, and Baoying in Northern Jiangsu, killing more than 1,700 Japanese troops and seizing countless spoils.</p>
<p>Western Zhejiang: They attacked Yuanhua Town and besieged Jiaxing, achieving great gains.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui: Over 40 Japanese warships were sunk, and over 500 Japanese troops were killed.</p>
<p>On the 12th, the Chinese Air Force, following the achievements of the 2nd, bombed Yueyang again, completely destroying the Japanese ammunition depot and sinking many Japanese warships on the shore of Dongting Lake. These were all important war events of the week. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Gansu Provincial Government Promotes Cotton Planting</h3>
<p>Lanzhou, the land of Gansu Province is located on a plateau, but the climate and environment are suitable for cotton planting. In the past, because farmers did not know how to plant cotton, the province's cotton demand was supplied by Shaanxi Province. In recent years, with the advocacy of the local authorities, cotton planting has been tried in the Longnan area, and the results have been quite satisfactory. However, due to the small amount of cotton fields and the limited scenery, the provincial government has formulated a three-year plan to promote cotton planting in order to increase rear production. It has decided to start implementing it this year. It is planned to promote it in eleven counties, including Lanzhou, in the first year, with 30,000 mu of cotton fields; in thirteen counties, including Pingliang, in the second year, with 130,000 mu of cotton fields; and in thirteen counties, including Jingyuan, in the third year, with 340,000 mu of cotton fields. In total, 500,000 mu of cotton fields will be promoted in three years. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wuhan's Puppet Police Corps Uprising</h3>
<p>Li Zhuwei, the squad leader of the first squadron of the Wuhan Daqiaohe puppet self-police corps, did not want to be attached to the Japanese and took the opportunity to revolt. He launched an attack on the Japanese army on the first day of this month, killing many Japanese troops and destroying the headquarters of the puppet self-police corps. The puppet corps leader Lu Nansu barely escaped with his life. After the revolt, Li and others safely arrived at the Chinese military defense area on the 7th to surrender, bringing with them 93 rifles, 23 pistols, and 2 machine guns, ready to kill the Japanese.

<h3>Japan's Future Strategy</h3>
<p>According to Tokyo sources: The Japanese military department convened an important military meeting from the 7th to the 11th of this month, gathering major military leaders and their representatives from inside and outside the country. It is reported that issues such as strengthening unity, military-civilian cooperation, the goals of the war against China, and the Saito slip of the tongue case were discussed. The process and outcome of such a meeting are naturally not easily known to outsiders, and therefore it is difficult to make an accurate judgment. However, Japan's current movements should still focus on the China issue. In the military aspect, it is nothing more than carefully considering its invasion strategy after the recent launch of a political offensive. Just looking at this point and the several issues discussed at the above military conference, it is enough to show that this political offensive by the Japanese was a failed masterpiece.</p>
<p>Regardless of what kind of grand slogans and propaganda the Japanese authorities use regarding the invasion of China, its ultimate goal is nothing more than conquering China and enslaving China. This is something that anyone with even a little common sense can discern. Whether it is a military offensive, or an offensive in politics, diplomacy, or economics, it is nothing more than a means to achieve this goal. The Japanese warlords have no preference or aversion to various means, but choose and use them according to the times. Military offensives naturally require the most effort and the greatest sacrifice. Three years ago, they blindly used this as the main way to invade China, but in the recent year or so, it has proven impossible to achieve definite success, and it has become an excessive burden for the Japanese. As a result, the use of political means has replaced military deployments and has been placed in the important position of the front line. In fact, even from the perspective of Japanese domestic public opinion, this use has not been given a very high evaluation. At most, it is hoped that it can give war-weary Japanese soldiers and civilians a new vision. The actual gains have not only failed to match its past acts of aggression, not only failed to replace the tasks of the invading Japanese army, but have also increased its burden. If this offensive is being used by the Japanese as an excitement and anesthetic, then after this excitement and anesthesia, and the disappointment and fluctuations that follow, the already exhausted military strength and morale will inevitably become more decadent and fragile, and even the little combat standard that existed in the past will be difficult to maintain. Among the topics of this Tokyo military conference, it is said that promoting closer unity and close cooperation between the military and civilians are important items, which shows that the phenomenon of internal separation and disunity in Japan must have gradually surfaced, thus arousing the attention of its military center.</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether Japan's political offensive is maintained, abandoned, or how it is used, and regardless of how weak the Japanese military strength has become, after this military conference, the invading Japanese army will take another active action, which is expected. As for whether its movements will continue to seek to penetrate the interior, or prepare to defend stubbornly in the occupied areas, or defend the north and advance south, or turn to invade the north, all remain to be proven by facts. In general, according to past experience, none of the Japanese army's attempts to invade in the past year or so have been successful, and none have failed to suffer serious defeats. For example, the recent battles in Suiyuan West, Guinan, and Northern Jiangxi have all provided very clear examples. Even if the Japanese army changes its strategy in the future and concentrates its main force in one corner in order to achieve success, as far as the overall war situation is concerned, if the Japanese cannot greatly increase their troops, then even if they want to continue to commit internal crimes, they will ultimately achieve nothing. If only three or several divisions are added to the troops, it is only enough for short-term consumption. Examining various facts and situations, and trying to speculate, the future Japanese strategy will be to defend by attacking. It only seeks to form the points and lines it occupies into a plane. At most, it is nothing more than attempting to open up the north-south transportation trunk lines. Although it is a great question whether the strength of the Japanese will allow this attempt, its intention should not be more than this. Looking at the direction of Japanese development: recently, the Japanese warlords are eyeing the opportunity to take advantage of the expansion of the European war to invade the Western countries' territories in the South Pacific. It is also coordinating with its diplomatic offensive, both seeking to threaten China's anti-Japanese base in the southwest, and seeking to threaten China through international pressure and coerce Britain and France. Therefore, the sea and land strongholds occupied by the Japanese in China, Central China, and South China must be seen as the center of all military deployments, in order to create the foundation for its traditional southern advance policy. At the same time, although Japan's attempt to collude with the Soviet Union has failed, since the Soviet Union may not be involved in the vortex of the European war, Japan will not suddenly take on the role of a vanguard of the anti-Soviet crusade and engage in adventurous operations to the north. In summary, the issue of the goal of the war against China discussed at this Tokyo military conference was probably to re-estimate its remaining strength and seek to concentrate it on the so-called "mopping-up war" in the occupied areas, and to emphasize the maintenance and opening up of the dot-money in Central China and South China.</p>
<p>It has been widely reported that the Japanese army is shortening its front lines and stopping its offensive. Looking at the current situation, this is possible. Moreover, judging from the dispatch of troops to several locations on the Beijing-Shanghai line in the past three or four days, this has been partially confirmed. However, no matter how much the Japanese warlords emphasize their political offensive to deceive themselves, they must immediately relax their military application. Of course, even if the Japanese army blindly invades again, it will only create more new defeats. Even temporary anesthesia and excitement will eventually lead to weaker public morale and more blunt military strength, and eventually even the defensive posture will be impossible to maintain. However, as far as China is concerned, it should still be aware of Japan's recent deployments and mobilizations, and must be seriously prepared.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Japan, even if it forms a tense war in all aspects of politics, diplomacy, and economics, its final gains and losses must still be clearly expressed from the military perspective. The arrangements in various aspects such as politics are nothing more than to assist and promote the implementation of military goals. The more a military force is struggling, the more urgent it is to open up other paths outside the military to alleviate its poverty. This fact, as well as the countless examples in the north-south battlefield for more than a year, have all exposed Japan's problems and hinted at the trend of the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<h3>Dutch Queen Issues Order: Expands National Martial Law Area; Officialdom Simultaneously Declares Neutral Policy; Belgium Mustering Troops and Preparing for Contingencies</h3>
<p>The martial law order declared in many parts of central, western, and frozen southern Netherlands was extended last night to the south, east, and north. Official announcements said that some foreign newspapers were moved by the remarks made by the British and French parliaments regarding neutral countries. They are now saying that neutral countries may have reached prior compromises with the Allied Powers so that the Allied Powers can provide assistance in the event of an external attack. It should be known that the Dutch government has adopted an unshakeable and unambitious neutral policy from the beginning, and will continue to maintain it in the future. In this policy, there is no room for prior agreement with any belligerent country. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Ambition to Annex Dutch East Indies Increasingly Revealed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Today's News: Japan has been paying close attention to the European situation, particularly whether the Netherlands will be drawn into the war. According to informed sources, the Japanese government believes that if the Netherlands becomes involved, it will inevitably affect the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese government is considering declaring to other countries its intention to prevent the war from spreading to the Western Pacific. It is also preparing to take reciprocal measures if other countries do not heed its declaration. This warning from Japan will be delivered to foreign envoys by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to foreign governments by Japanese envoys abroad. Local officials are keeping silent about foreign news reports that Japan might occupy the Dutch East Indies if the Netherlands joins the European war. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Chuo Commercial News, and other newspapers have been speculating on the future of the Dutch East Indies. In recent days, they have used large headlines to speculate on Japan's attitude toward preventing the spread of war to Nanyang, where Japan has mandated territories. The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Japanese government will adhere to a policy of non-interference in the European war and will devote all its efforts to Chinese affairs. However, Japan is closely watching the development of the European situation and does not want to see the war spread to the South Pacific region. Therefore, the Japanese government is considering plans to deal with any eventuality. However, if Japan decides to deal with the situation caused by the Dutch East Indies being drawn into the whirlpool of war, it will try to avoid being misunderstood by third countries. Therefore, Japan should ask our country to pay attention to this matter and express its desire to urge the belligerent countries and other countries concerned to do their best to prevent the war from spreading to the South Pacific. This step may be taken through the diplomatic representatives of the belligerent countries and other countries concerned in Tokyo or through the Japanese diplomatic representatives abroad, depending on the situation. The Asahi Shimbun also analyzes the war situation in Europe, saying that as a result of Germany's actions in Northern Europe, the future development of the war will be a struggle between Britain and Germany for influence in the Netherlands. For this reason, the situation on the German-Dutch border has recently become very tense. If the Netherlands unfortunately falls into the whirlpool of war, the entry of foreign armed forces, whether British or German, will immediately raise the question of whether the Dutch East Indies should fight. Japan has close economic ties with the Dutch East Indies and must pay close attention to the possible developments there. Europe is now making three different speculations about the future of the Dutch East Indies: (1) the territory will become a British protectorate or be temporarily placed under British rule; (2) the Dutch government may move to the territory; (3) the territory will ask the United States for protection. Japan is now adhering to a policy of not participating in the European war and does not want the war to spread to the East. The participation of Yilan has caused changes in the political union or political division of the Dutch East Indies. Although the United States authorities have tried to avoid explicitly stating their attitude towards the German invasion of Denmark, President Roosevelt is now very concerned about the status of Greenland. The United States and Qing also believe that Greenland should separate from Europe and join the American continent, and then the United States will protect it through the Monroe Doctrine. In this situation, Japan is now striving to take appropriate steps to prevent the Dutch East Indies from participating in the European war, so as to avoid the war from affecting the East. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Boli Gov, a famous news reporter in Beijing who has close ties with Churchill, published an article in Antwerp yesterday, claiming that, according to British opinion, there should be no neutrality in Europe today. Germany's neutral neighbors should accept the control of the Allied countries. Anyone who refuses should accept the consequences of war. Boli pointed out that the situation in the Netherlands and Belgium is the most difficult. Both countries are weak and have vast colonies. Britain and France have the responsibility to protect all colonies during the war. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Australia Strictly Restricting Imports of Goods Outside the Sterling Bloc Japan Has a Stockpile of 900 Million Square Yards of Cotton Goods Ministry of Foreign Affairs Anxious About Retaliatory Threats</h3>
<p>Tokyo, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the Australian Federal Government of the British Commonwealth is increasingly restricting imports of goods from countries outside the Sterling Bloc. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very concerned about this situation and has instructed Consul-General Ichikawa in Sydney to notify the Australian government that such measures are sufficient to cause Japan to take retaliatory measures. According to the various control measures taken by the Australian government, no impact has yet occurred on Japanese goods, but in the future the scope will be expanded to restrict Japanese cotton yarn and rayon, and it is possible that other British territories will follow Australia's lead and take the same measures. If so, Japanese goods are in danger of being completely excluded. Since the outbreak of the European war, Britain has severely restricted imports in order to fully maintain its foreign exchange and import various necessary food and raw materials. The autonomous territories have been able to cooperate closely with it. Until recently, Japan protested to the Australian government for reducing the quantity of wool exported to Japan, but without effect. It is doubtful what effect this second protest will have. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, in the first quarter of this year, Japan's exports of cotton goods to countries outside the Japanese yen bloc exceeded 10.1 million yen in value, an increase of 23.3% over the previous quarter. However, in terms of quantity, it was 49.7 million square yards, a decrease of 5.8% compared with the previous quarter. Many of the goods that were originally planned to be shipped in December of last year were not shipped until January of this year. At the end of the first quarter of this year, there was a stockpile of 900 million square yards of cotton goods, which is an unprecedented high number. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the export situation in the second quarter of this year is not good. It is expected that if no measures are taken to clear the backlog, the cotton goods inventory will continue to increase by 400 million to 500 million square yards between April and August. The Japan Cotton Spinning Association believes that the only solution is to reduce cotton production. The Asahi Shimbun believes that there is another solution, which is to transport part of the inventory to Japanese yen bloc countries, such as Manchuria and North China, where market prices are higher. Exporters and cotton mills have long had this intention, but the Japanese government has prohibited it two years ago because it hinders exports to non-yen bloc countries and interrupts the supply of foreign currency that the Japanese government considers necessary. The Asahi Shimbun also said that foreign cotton goods inventories are higher than in previous years, because speculators expect prices to rise and rush to purchase and store, resulting in purchases exceeding actual needs. The strengthening of British and French controls on Japanese cotton goods will also greatly reduce the import of Japanese cotton goods. Therefore, the export of Japanese cotton goods will continue to decline in the future. The hoarding of Japanese cloth by merchants in China, and the change to local products by those who purchase Japanese goods in Central and South America and the British Commonwealth, are also reasons why the export of Japanese cotton goods will not be strong in the future.

<h3>Roosevelt Issues Proclamation Condemning German Invasion of Denmark and Norway Neighboring Countries' Sovereignty and Territory Should Be Respected United States Deeply Abhors Violent Acts Will Not Allow Germany to Plant Influence in Greenland</h3>
<p>Washington, President Roosevelt issued a document today, condemning the invasion of Norway and Denmark, stating that the US government has expressed its condemnation of this illegal use of force. It is further clarified the views on such actions, as in order to preserve civilization, the rights of weak countries to independence and territorial integrity and self-government opportunities must be respected by their stronger neighbors. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington, after the European war expanded to the Scandinavian Peninsula, although the United States condemned Germany's invasion of Norway and Denmark, it may not take any action or change its foreign policy. The general opinion of responsible parties in Washington can be summarized as follows: Since the Finnish problem failed to cause the intervention of the United States, other events will not cause the United States to take the field, at least during this presidential election. However, President Roosevelt has immediately issued a proclamation to protect the rights of Americans in the war zone, expanding the war zone stipulated in the Neutrality Act to the seas around the Scandinavian Peninsula and some Arctic Ocean ports of the Soviet Union. In the past, American ships were not allowed to call at ports in southern Norway or the Baltic Sea, but they could still anchor in Bergen or other northern ports. Now, according to the new regulations, the only points that American ships can reach are Portugal and northern Spain and neutral ports in the Mediterranean. The United States' huge financial interests in Scandinavia are now in danger. According to the State Department, American long-term investments that are endangered by the German invasion of Scandinavia are estimated at 25 million pounds for Denmark, 23 million pounds for Norway, and 8.5 million pounds for Sweden. Although American isolationists sympathize with the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula and regret the loss of American trade, they are still working to promote the United States' withdrawal from the war. Most people in Congress advocate maintaining a calm mind and not taking action. Representative Hill, one of the leaders of the Washington isolationists, recently said, "Although I admit that Germany's recent actions are a major blow to democraticism itself, I still oppose the United States joining the war." However, if Germany takes any action toward Greenland and wants to plant air force bases there, the US authorities may change their attitude. If Germany does so, the Allies will resist and the war will be closer to the United States. If Hitler expands his aggression in the Scandinavian Peninsula to Greenland and Iceland, what will the US policy be? President Roosevelt does not want to make any announcements on this point. However, the US president's concern about Greenland was seen yesterday when he hosted news reporters. At that time, the US president stated that he had asked the Red Cross to pay attention to the needs of the 17,000 residents of Greenland when Danish supplies were interrupted. The "New York Post" published an article by Platter, a well-known American expert, saying that for self-defense, the United States cannot safely watch a violent and tyrannical country such as Germany planting its influence in Iceland and Greenland. The "Springfield Republican" advocates that Canada should take over Greenland, which is more appropriate than the United States taking it over. Its intention is probably to prevent the United States from joining the war. However, the "Baltimore Sun" said that if Germany has any demands on Greenland or Iceland, it will inevitably cause the most serious problem under the Monroe Doctrine. The most serious aspect of new developments, from the American point of view, is probably here. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Greenland's Cryolite Is an Important Mineral for Military Use British Urge Early Control</h3>
<p>London, metallurgists here told the press yesterday that Britain and France should implement a plan to strictly control Greenland shipping as soon as possible, and should not miss the opportunity. The cryolite produced in Greenland is an important item for military applications. The manufacture of aluminum cannot be done without this mineral, and the only place in the world that produces cryolite is Ivigtut in Greenland. Last year, a total of 30,000 tons of cryolite were exported from Ivigtut. The United States and Germany each accounted for 12,000 tons of this amount. If the above-mentioned estimate is accurate, then Germany has obtained enough for one year's use. Germany has spent many years trying to manufacture this cryolite, but the output is very small and the cost is very high. It is better to seek natural products. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Write Articles Commenting on the European Situation</h3>
<p>New York newspapers have given great coverage to the British navy's victory in Narvik, and have also published articles discussing Germany's mess in the recent developments in Europe. The newspapers also state that the government will not deviate from the extremely cautious policy of not interfering in the European war in any way, especially because the presidential election will be held soon. A New York Times' Washington correspondent said that the general mood now is that although the country's policy has not changed due to the spread of the war, it is paying more attention to the development of the European situation than before. A New York dispatch said, "The fate of Greenland has brought the war closer to home. If the Netherlands is invaded, the fate of Curaçao and the Dutch East Indies will bring the war within striking distance of our main defenses." Today, as in 1917, the people are afraid of the thought of participating in the war, but the United States must deal with the possibility of the event, that is, the United States may be forced to join the war as the only way to protect its interests.

<h3>Britain and France Order the Latest Bombers from the United States</h3>
<p>Washington, Britain and France have obtained the permission of the US Department of the Army to order new twin-engine Douglas bombers from the US. It is widely believed that this type of aircraft can fly 400 miles per hour and is the fastest of the Douglas aircraft in the world. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>American Ships Free Navigation in Northern Europe United States Makes Demands to Britain and Germany</h3>
<p>Washington, the US Ambassador to Britain and the Minister to Norway have, according to the US intelligence conference yesterday, requested Britain and Germany to allow American ships to navigate freely and protect them in Scandinavian seaports, without interference from any warships, according to Secretary of State Hull. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington, the US government is now urging Britain, Germany, and Norway to allow the three US ships currently in Norwegian ports to return to their country. The three ships are the Flying Fish and the McCormick, both of which are currently in Bergen, and the Mormacsea, which is currently in Trondheim. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Canada Prohibits Trade with Denmark</h3>
<p>Ottawa, the Canadian Federal Government issued an order today stating that since Denmark has been occupied by German forces, it should technically be regarded as an enemy country. Therefore, the law prohibiting people from trading with enemy countries should be applied to that country from today. All commercial and financial transactions are prohibited. However, the Danish Faroe Islands (which have been occupied by Britain) and Greenland have not fallen and can still trade with the country as usual. In addition, it is hoped that domestic merchants will be particularly cautious when trading with Norway. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy Watches and Changes with the Wind</h3>
<p>Rome, foreign observers here recently stated that if Britain and France only use naval and air forces to fight in Norway and allow German forces to remain in Norway, Italian public opinion will believe that this situation is sufficient to enhance Germany's military strategic position, and thus believe that the German army is indeed invincible. Italian public opinion has not clearly endorsed Germany in general, but because Italy suffered from sanctions imposed by Britain and France during the Abyssinian War, and Britain sent a fleet into the Mediterranean at that time, the Italian people are still resentful of Britain, but their admiration for the power of the British navy remains the same. It will only be after Britain has lost its prestige at sea that it may come out to assist Germany in interfering in the European war. If Britain and France cannot prevent Germany from interfering in Norway, they will not be able to effectively prevent Italy from blocking the Strait of Otranto (between Italy and Yugoslavia) and occupying the small islands belonging to Greece. Italy has been deliberately planning this matter for a long time, and all preparations have been completed, but it will not take any action until Britain and France and Germany decide the outcome.

<h3>Soviet-Lithuanian Border Demarcation Work Completed New Soviet-Finnish Border Also Demarcated</h3>
<p>Moscow, the Central Mixed Committee for the Demarcation of the Soviet-Lithuanian Border recently issued an announcement stating that the work on the Demarcation of the Soviet-Lithuanian Border was completed in March 1940. The entire border is 370 kilometers long, with 609 border markers and 1,218 border pillars. Most of the surveying work on the border has also been completed. (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, the Soviet-Finnish Border Demarcation Committee completed its task yesterday and demarcated the new border. According to Finnish political figures, Finland can accept the provisions of this new border. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Germany Asks for Passage Soviet Union Did Not Approve</h3>
<p>Moscow, the British Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, and a Lithuanian newspaper, recently reported that German troops had been transported from Germany to Murmansk long ago, and recently transported from Murmansk to Narvik. TASS recently issued a solemn statement authorized by the government that this report is absolutely untrue and contains provocative content. (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, the Lithuanian Times here recently published a message from the Lithuanian capital stating that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, had requested Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to allow German warships to use the Soviet port of Murmansk and the railway from Leningrad to Murmansk, but the Soviet authorities refused in order to avoid being involved in the war in Northern Europe.

<h3>Norwegian Northern Waters: Unprecedented Naval Battle Between British and German Forces; London Gazette Claims Seven German Ships Sunk; At Least Three British Destroyers Damaged</h3>
<p>London, British Admiralty announced last night: Since the British Second Destroyer Flotilla attacked German destroyers in Narvik Bay on Wednesday, the British ships have blockaded the enemy ships in Narvik Bay. Today, at noon, the British battleship "Warspite" (31,000 tons) led several destroyers deep into the bay to attack the German destroyers. Several of them have been damaged, and they bombarded the shore batteries, as it was reported that batteries had been built ashore. This battle was extremely successful, and the enemy's resistance was not severe. The land howitzers erected on the shore were destroyed by the British naval gunfire. Four German destroyers were destroyed and sunk in Narvik Bay, and the other three fled into the 8-9 mile long Djupvik fjord behind the town of Narvik, but were also pursued and destroyed by the British ships. When this communiqué was issued, the Admiralty was still not certain of the situation in Narvik, but many people, mostly German soldiers, had fled from the town and escaped over the mountains. All the details are not yet known. Although seven enemy ships were destroyed, the British side was not without losses. Three British destroyers were damaged during the battle, but the injuries were not serious. The loss of British lives is estimated to be significant. The German loss of life cannot be estimated at present, but the seven destroyers must have carried more than a thousand sailors. The Admiralty has sent telegrams to congratulate the officers and soldiers who contributed to this battle, as it can clarify the situation in a part of the Norwegian coast. The war is still in progress. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin, German High Command communiqué stated: The Battle of Narvik was a serious battle. It said that the British navy participating in yesterday's attack included two battleships, two aircraft carriers, and two cruisers, as well as a large number of destroyers. German destroyers attacked the superior British forces. The British destroyer "Cossack" caught fire and ran aground. The British destroyer "Eskimo" and several other ships were heavily damaged or destroyed. The German losses were not listed. The communiqué also stated that a German submarine had sunk a British Glasgow-class cruiser north of Shetland, and that German destroyer boats had destroyed three British submarines in Skagerrak. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin, the Propaganda Ministry told the press last night that they had not yet received any reports of yesterday's naval battle in Narvik. As for the news issued by the British Admiralty that British ships had sunk seven German destroyers, the Propaganda Ministry refused to comment. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>London, the British fleet sank as many as seven German destroyers in the waters off Narvik Harbor yesterday. People in charge here have commented on this, saying that this major victory has become the pivot for a sudden turn in the Nordic war situation. In one day, the British navy was able to sink all of the German destroyers in Narvik Harbor. Germany only has 30 destroyers, all of which are the latest models, but since the outbreak of the Nordic war, it has lost as many as ten in four or five days. It can be seen that yesterday's battle of Narvik was a major defeat for the German navy. The British and French fleets now control the waters off Narvik Harbor, so it is extremely convenient for the British and French expeditionary forces to land there. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Bombs Stavanger Airport, Dropping Heavy Bombs Causing Significant Damage; German Aircraft Engage in Combat, One Shot Down</h3>
<p>London, the British Air Ministry claimed that yesterday morning, the British coastal aircraft squadron dropped a large number of bombs on Stavanger Airport, causing significant damage to the aircraft and facilities. A British aircraft was attacked by an enemy twin-engine fighter. The enemy bullets were fired repeatedly and at close range. Although the British aircraft was damaged, the tail gunner continued to fight back until the enemy aircraft caught fire and crashed. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London, British aircraft formations engaged in aerial combat with German aircraft formations in Norway today, immediately shooting down and damaging one German aircraft each. Both of these aircraft were German Messerschmitt 110s, the latest military aircraft in the country. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to news from Narvik, a British destroyer formation was hit by a bomb from a German aircraft in the West Bay yesterday afternoon and immediately sank. A British reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in Narvik, and another British aircraft was shot down in an aerial battle south of the city. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin, yesterday nine British aircraft bombed Narvik Harbor. According to neutral observers, the British aircraft dropped bombs too hastily, so most of them did not hit the target. Only one bomb hit near the barracks, injuring three German soldiers. The aircraft was then shot down into the sea by German anti-aircraft fire. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Sinking of the British Ship "York" Is Unconfirmed by London</h3>
<p>London, last night the German High Command broadcasted that, according to reports from Amsterdam, the British cruiser "York" had been sunk on Thursday. However, London has not confirmed this statement. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Churchill Scheduled to Report on Naval Battles Tomorrow</h3>
<p>London, Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, is scheduled to report to the House of Commons on the recent naval battles in the Norwegian and Baltic waters on the 16th of this month. If necessary, the House of Commons will hold a debate on the 17th or 18th, or hold a closed-door meeting to discuss the economic war and general operational policies, which are all possible.

<h3>Norwegian Destroyer Sinks German Transport Ship; 67 Germans Captured</h3>
<p>Stockholm, according to news from the Norwegian news agency, the Norwegian destroyer "Torbjørn" reported to the British Admiralty that it had sunk a German transport ship near Hoggesund. The destroyer initially sent personnel to board the transport ship and open its seacocks, but because a German aircraft bombed it, it was unsuccessful. The destroyer sailed away, but the seacocks were destroyed by German aircraft. The ship then returned, captured 67 Germans on the transport ship, and then fired and sank the transport ship before joining the British fleet in Scapa Flow. The captured German prisoners have now been handed over to the British for detention. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>German Reinforcements Invading Norway Are Advancing Towards the Swedish Border; Consolidating the Gateway to Oslo; The Town of Halden is Occupied</h3>
<p>Stockholm, according to news received here, German troops are landing on the southern coast of Norway at Skjeberg in a steady stream and are actively advancing towards the Swedish border. Yesterday at noon, they had already reached Lakseda. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to official claims, German heavy artillery units have arrived in Trondheim to reinforce Norway's artillery positions. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, according to a broadcast from Oslo received here, more German troops continued to arrive in Oslo from Denmark yesterday. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, this morning's "Dagens Nyheter" reported that the Fredriksten Fortress and the nearby town of Halden were occupied by German troops yesterday without resistance. The former is the gateway to the Oslofjord, and the latter is an important Norwegian station along the Oslo-Gothenburg railway line. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, last night a local newspaper claimed that German and Norwegian troops fought fiercely northeast of Oslo in Kongsvinger yesterday. German bombers also attacked Norwegian troops north of Oslo. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Vormsund area near Kongsvinger, and extended to the Arne area within Oslo. The German air offensive was concentrated on Eidsvoll. Yesterday, a spokesman for the Norwegian legation here said that the Norwegian troops and volunteers, although aware that German troops had landed, were still defending the Salten of the Oslofjord. The Norwegian flag is still flying on the strong Norwegian artillery positions near Fredriksten. The spokesman added that the number of German troops landing in Trondheim was not large, and that the German troops had access to the roads along the Trondheimsfjord at Storen, and he denied the rumor that Norway and Germany had reopened negotiations. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, according to news from the Norwegian front, after the fall of the city of Fredrikstad, the country's troops automatically abandoned the city of Halden, retreated to the east bank of the Glomma River, and continued to resist. Before the fall of Fredrikstad, it was said that it had been heavily bombed by German aircraft and strafed by machine guns, resulting in heavy casualties. However, the fighting in the area is still in progress. A summary of the situation in various places is as follows: (1) In the area of Rømskog, the two sides made contact in the morning and were still fighting fiercely until late at night. The Norwegian army resisted quite successfully. (2) In the area of Sarpsborg (northwest of Halden), Nazi Party activists were active and sent signals at night, notifying the German army of the location of the Norwegian army. A Norwegian army officer was also arrested by the military authorities for taking measures "sufficient to hinder mobilization." (3) In the area of Kongsvinger (48 miles northeast of Oslo), the evacuation of civilians has been completed, and the local situation is still calm. However, a fierce battle took place in the town of Eidsvoll, northwest of the city, this afternoon. According to the Swedish "Dagens Telegram", German troops are attacking Norwegian troops from Lillestrøm (east of Oslo) in the direction of Kongsvinger, attempting to cut off transportation between Norway and Sweden. (4) In the area of Oslo, the entire line from Halden in the southeast, via Mysen, Årnes, to Eidsvoll, is under German control. However, the German troops' attempt to cross the Vorma River has not yet succeeded. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Activities in Sweden Reveal Ambitions; If Swedish Neutrality is Violated, Britain Will Provide Full Assistance</h3>
<p>Paris, according to responsible sources here, the Allied Powers have decided that if Sweden is invaded by Germany, the Allied Powers will provide Sweden with full assistance. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, the Social Democratic newspaper recently reported that Nazi Party members are actively active in Sweden. A former military officer came here from Boden to recruit unemployed workers, paying them one and a half kronor (Swedish currency) per day, attempting to form some kind of group. The police authorities arrested him and found many propaganda materials in his residence. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris, well-informed sources here said that the German Propaganda Ministry often gave speeches to Swedish journalists on this day, claiming that the intention of the British and French to lay mines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits was to change Germany's position with respect to Sweden. From this statement, Hitler's ambitions for Sweden have been revealed. At this point, whether Sweden's neutral status can be maintained depends on the intention of the German High Command. If Germany cannot transport personnel and supplies to Norway by sea, it will have to pass through Sweden and transport them by land. This has also been hinted at by German political figures, who said that if transporting personnel to Norway by air is insufficient in the future, they should request that Sweden allow them to transport guns and ammunition through the country's railways. Regarding this matter, Swedish Prime Minister Hansson delivered a nationwide broadcast speech yesterday, reiterating his determination to maintain neutrality and forcefully stating that if other countries violate its neutrality by force, it will resolutely resist it. Any neutral country that allows the personnel and military supplies of belligerent countries to pass through its territory will no longer be a neutral country. In short, the German propaganda authorities obviously want to put pressure on public opinion in the country before the government officially makes a request to Sweden, but this strategy has long been anticipated by the Swedish authorities and will eventually fail.

<h3>German Military Commander's "Three Laws" for Norwegians: Disobedience Means Death, Death, Death</h3>
<p>Oslo, General Falkenhorst, the commander of the German troops in Oslo, delivered a broadcast speech to the Norwegian people today, stating that the German troops came to protect Norway from invasion by the Western powers. "We have extended our hand to the Norwegian people, and we hope that you will all accept our kindness. If you allow us to complete our mission without hindering us, our actions will naturally be calm and peaceful, as we did in Denmark. Otherwise, we will have to take strict and rude measures." Now, I tell you, anyone who attempts to sabotage transportation facilities will die; anyone who carries weapons will die; anyone who conspires to resist the government and damage the interests of the country will die; anyone who enlists in the military in accordance with the mobilization order of the Nygaardsvold government (referring to the legitimate government of Norway) will die. In a word, we want to live in peace with our neighbors. The Danish people deeply understand this intention, so they warmly welcome our troops, which is very grateful. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>German Military's Future Strategy in Norway</h3>
<p>Paris, military figures here said that the future route of the German troops will be no more than three: one will proceed to the Swedish border, two will advance along the railway lines from Oslo and Trondheim, and three will proceed to the port of Bergen. The number of troops currently operating in Norway is about 15,000. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Guarantee Norway Immediate and Effective Assistance; British King Expresses Admiration for the Steadfast and Brave Spirit of Norway's Government and People in Telegram to Norwegian King</h3>
<p>Stockholm, according to news from Norway, the Norwegian government has received a firm guarantee from the British and French governments that they will provide immediate and effective assistance, and that the necessary troops will soon land in Norway. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London, British King George telegraphed the Norwegian King, saying that Germany, with its pre-arranged tyrannical actions, has extended the war to your country. At this critical moment, I would like to express my own and the entire country's admiration for the glorious, brave, and steadfast actions of your government and people. I can assure you that the British and French governments are now providing Norway with all the assistance they can, so that the Allied forces fighting alongside the Norwegian people can prove that Germany's recent atrocities are not only cruel but also reckless.

<h3>British Military Officer Tells Norwegians How to Resist the Enemy: Persist in Resistance to Await Assistance</h3>
<p>London, a general who once served as the British military attaché in Oslo recently broadcasted from London, telling the Norwegian people that the best way to stop the German troops from advancing is that the Allied forces are now coming quickly to help, and the Norwegian people should hold their ground and not retreat. There are five ways for the Norwegian people to resist the enemy: (1) Report the details of the movement of German troops, ships, and aircraft to the nearest Norwegian or British military headquarters. (2) Follow the instructions of the Allied commander and cut off telephone lines. (3) Chop down trees and demolish bridges to block roads departing from German-occupied territories. (4) Move all automobiles, trucks, carts, and horses to prevent them from being acquired by the Germans. (5) Help demolish the railways connected to the bases occupied by the enemy forces.

<h3>German Occupation of Denmark; Experiences of British, French, and Polish Diplomats; Safe Return Home Via The Hague</h3>
<p>The Hague, one hundred and eighty British, French, and Polish diplomatic personnel recently arrived here from Copenhagen via Denmark. According to their eyewitness accounts of the German occupation of Denmark, it is estimated that 70,000 German troops passed through Copenhagen in the past two days. The British Minister to Denmark, Smith, is also among this group. Smith was detained by German troops on April 9th for several hours. According to a female staff member of the Soviet legation, the arrival of the event was unexpected. German troops occupied the city at 8 o'clock, initially only a large team, with 50 bombers. They scattered leaflets in the air to inform residents of the changes that had taken place. "I rushed to the embassy and rang the doorbell. After the door opened, two German soldiers in full armor stood in front of me. Later, the German army detained a beer truck and carried the British Embassy staff to a fortress. The British Minister was spared the humiliation of being loaded into the truck and traveled by car. We were all detained until the afternoon before being released and had some freedom." According to another embassy official, they were fortunate to have time to burn all the codes before the arrival of the German troops. According to general eyewitnesses, the Danish people seemed to be dazzled by this unexpected change. Although their attitude was quite calm, they had no idea how to deal with the situation. The remaining diplomatic personnel took a train across the German border. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Trade Relations with Nordic Countries</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, according to official statistics on British international trade, the goods imported by Britain from the Nordic countries in 1938 are as follows: The percentage of British imports in the total exports of the Nordic countries in 1938 is as follows: Denmark 56.1, Norway 24.7, Sweden 23.1.</p>
<p>The percentage of British imports in the total exports of Norway and Sweden is lower, but it is still the first. The main exports of Denmark and Sweden are food, butter, eggs, and cured meat. In 1938, Britain imported 14,300,000 pounds of butter, 17,000,000 pounds of cured meat, and 48,000,000 pounds of eggs from Denmark and Sweden. In 1938, Britain imported 65,000 to 75,000 pigs from Denmark every week, accounting for 65% of the total pork imports. In addition, British imports of Danish poultry accounted for 27% of the total imports. Domestic products account for only 25% of the food consumed in Britain. British production of butter accounts for only 9% of total consumption, with the remaining 91% relying on foreign supply, and the Nordic countries supply 33%. It is difficult to imagine the great impact of Britain losing the supply from the Nordic countries. Britain is also experiencing the same impact in terms of raw materials. The raw materials imported by Britain from Sweden and Norway are as follows:</p>
<h3>Earthquakes and Floods in Turkey</h3>
<p>Ankara, in the areas of central and northern Anatolia that experienced severe earthquakes last December, severe earthquakes have been felt intermittently in the past 24 hours. Earthquakes have also occurred in Ankara. Except for six deaths and 80 houses collapsed in Cifte, the damage is said to be minor. Terrified residents fled to the fields, all fearing that the recent disaster would be repeated. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, a vast area of eastern Anatolia, Turkey, has been flooded due to flash floods. It is reported that many houses have been washed away, but fortunately only five people have drowned so far. (Haitong, 14th)</p>

<h3>New Minefield Laid by British in Baltic Sea, Blocking Sweden's Iron Ore Route to Germany; Germany Also Laying Mines in Belt Straits</h3>
<p>London, the Admiralty announced that mines have been laid in the Baltic Sea and its entrances, with the exception of Swedish territorial waters. This mining operation was completed this morning. Sources in London pointed out that this new minefield will be another major obstacle to Sweden's iron ore route to Germany. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London, the Admiralty announced that we have laid a minefield in the Baltic Sea, extending east and west from 10 degrees east longitude (the east coast of Jutland, Denmark) to 21 degrees east longitude (the west coast of Latvia and Lithuania), and north and south from 55 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to 57 degrees north latitude. The sea surface within this boundary is full of mines, making navigation dangerous. Merchant ships of all countries must avoid it, but mines have not been laid in Swedish territorial waters. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin, an official document here stated that mines have been laid in the Great and Little Belt Straits. The total area where mines have been laid is as follows: (1) In the Great Belt Strait, between 55.17 degrees north latitude and 5.22 degrees north latitude. (2) In the Little Belt Strait, between 9.47 degrees east longitude and 9.51 degrees east longitude, but navigation is not completely blocked. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>London, official sources here last night said that the British naval patrol day and night on the Norwegian coast has made it "almost impossible for Germany to land in northern Norway. As part of the Allies' plan to cut off communication between Germany and its occupying forces in Norway, Britain is now adopting a deadly new secret mine. Britain has deployed a small fleet in the Kattegat. Any attempt by Germany to transport armaments and supplies and reinforcements through the British minefield will be deterred. It is claimed that the Allied minefields along the coasts of the Netherlands and Norway and between Skagerrak and Kattegat (i.e., the entrance to the Baltic Sea) total about 60,000 square miles. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris, after the Allied forces successfully laid mines on the entire North Sea coastline between Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, cutting off Germany's sea transport with its troops in Scandinavia, the center of political, naval, and air warfare has shifted to Skagerrak and Kattegat. Sweden's neutrality is extremely important, because Sweden has a direct railway line from Malmö and Gothenburg to Oslo. If Germany occupies this railway line, it can strengthen its troops in southern Norway and avoid being trapped. French sources said yesterday that they are very uneasy about Sweden's position, because it is the last country bordering the Baltic Sea that has not participated in the war, and its current position is the same as that of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, and Norway when the Soviet Union and Germany made demands. The Allied cut-off of Germany's sea transport lines is a major threat to Germany. The French Naval Ministry has dispatched 20 French ships, which are now working with the Allied navies to concentrate. French sources announced last night that the key routes in Skagerrak are controlled by the Allied fleet, and the Allied power to keep the strait open can prevent Sweden from being strangled, because Sweden's oil and coal supplies all come from Gothenburg to imports. Sweden has recently reiterated its firm position, refusing any sacrifice of integrity and independence, and has followed the Allies in quickly laying 74 miles of mines in the Kattegat harbor to avoid a repeat of the German naval invasion of Norway and Denmark, and the possible attempt to seize Sweden's important highways.

<h3>Western Front German Army: Offensive Unsuccessful; French Issue Battle Report</h3>
<p>Paris, Last night, this station received a dispatch on the Western Front battle report, stating that yesterday's encounter battle resumed with great activity. East of the Moselle River, the German army first launched a heavy artillery attack, then used the artillery fire as cover to launch a localized attack, but it completely failed. The enemy army failed to breach the obstacle line and retreated backward. There were also encounters between reconnaissance teams on both sides in the east, with the victory belonging to the French. Between the Seille River and the Vosges Mountains, the French army launched a surprise attack, which was successful. (Fourteenth day, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris, The German army attempted to attack the lower Rhine region yesterday, which was the first time since the outbreak of the European war. A German unit attempted to rapidly cross the river at 2:15 AM yesterday and was ordered to seize an underground battery on an island between Hanneguis and Gambsheim. This place is the entrance to the Rhine River, flowing north and merging with the Roenne Canal, and is a key point for defense. The German attack has been repelled. The French counter-offensive air force has been extremely active in the past two days, reconnoitering the movements of the German front line, but due to the bad weather, the German planes only made a few front-line reconnaissance flights.

<p>Berlin, A Hutung News Agency reporter obtained information about the war from responsible parties, which was not published in the German army's battle report. A summary is as follows: The German army has repeatedly used surprise attacks on the Western Front, achieving meritorious service. In Seringues, southwest of Metz, there were two German commando teams that attacked the enemy's positions. Fierce battles broke out between the two sides, even hand-to-hand combat. As a result, the French soldiers were annihilated. German artillery participated in the battle, and the German side suffered very few casualties. Southwest of Sarrelautern, a German commando unit launched a surprise attack, killing ten French soldiers and wounding several others. Only one German soldier was injured. South of Zweibrücken, a French commando unit attempted to attack German positions after an hour of artillery bombardment, suffering heavy losses and returning without success.

<h3>Romania Strengthens Oil Mine Security; Orders Stockpiling of Kerosene</h3>

<h3>US Industrial Production Declines</h3>
<p>Washington, American industrial production has recently experienced an abnormal state of decline. This state may continue, and the period of wartime prosperity seems to have passed. According to statistics published by the Federal Reserve Bank Administration, the American industrial production index fell to 128 in January of last year, and then to 119 in January of this year. In February, it fell again to 109. The main reason is due to the reduction in the production of steel and several other commodities. As for the fact that exports in January were still able to maintain a high level, this was due to changes in foreign conditions and the particularly large amount of American cotton exports.

<h3>Tianjin Concession Blockaded; No Possibility of Termination; Japanese Army Mistreats British; Blockade Seems to Have Three Purposes</h3>
<p>North China Daily News, Tianjin, April 8th: Tianjin British people have been suffering for nearly a year. During this period, commerce stagnated, and they still suffer great humiliation. The British people, seeing that their suffering has no end in sight and not receiving the protection of their national representatives, are understandably feeling disappointed. Last summer, when the blockade began, British Foreign Secretary Halifax telegraphed the British people here to remain calm and assured them that the British government would provide all necessary protection. However, a year has passed, and the situation is as bad as ever. There has been no action to end the completely arbitrary and illegal behavior of the Japanese warlords in Tianjin. Many British people frankly say that even if they are mistreated, they have given up the idea of the British authorities lodging protests, because they are of no use. In fact, although the British ambassador to Japan uses flattering words, the British-Japanese relations in Tianjin have not only not improved, but are also deteriorating. In recent weekends, the humiliation suffered by British people entering and leaving the concession has been more arbitrary and shameful than before. This is the truth. British people are deliberately made things difficult for, and often have to wait for three hours before being allowed to pass through the entrances and exits. Sometimes, British people are mixed in with the ranks of Chinese coolies and have to proceed one by one to the entrances and exits to be pushed back into the ranks and then proceed again. Recently, two British people wanted to return to their residences in the concession one evening, but the Japanese soldiers refused them on the grounds that the time was too late and the entrances and exits were closed. The two British people had to spend the night outside the concession. British people who reside in the concession and have to go outside to work also frankly say that the time they spend being blocked at the entrances and exits is more than their working hours. Food transported into the concession, especially that purchased by British people, is bound to encounter all sorts of difficulties. Recently, a truck was forced to dump its contents before being allowed to drive into the concession empty. Such shameful incidents are countless and endless. The most frustrating thing is that this limited treatment is only applied to people holding British passports. People from other countries, including those from the Irish Free State and some dominions, are allowed to pass through the entrances and exits without hindrance. Therefore, holding a British passport is simply inviting humiliation. As for German and Italian people, they receive preferential treatment at the entrances and exits and on the railways. Most of the officers of the Japanese army must have very strong pro- feelings, but this has little to do with how they treat the British people in Tianjin, because the British people had already been mistreated before the outbreak of the European war. The Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin maintain the blockade of the Tianjin concession with their special local and political viewpoints, but they do not care about general policies. The purpose of the blockade seems to be threefold: (1) To give their "allies" the impression that the Japanese army is capable of insulting the nationals of Western powers without interference. (2) To make the lives of the British people extremely unbearable, eventually leading to the return of the concession. (3) To illegally collect donations at the entrances and exits, generating a substantial income. Since the British government will never recognize the Wang regime or make other concessions on general policies, the Tianjin blockade may not end. The Japanese troops in Tianjin have a tough attitude and constantly tell Chinese and other foreigners that the Japanese army in Tianjin is the decisive factor, and that talks in East Asia and elsewhere will not affect the army's plans. Therefore, they believe that it is futile to say flattering and meaningless words that can slightly move the Japanese warlords. It is quite possible that the more rational officials in the Tokyo government do not agree with the views of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin and do not support the blockade, but they are unwilling to try to make the army realize its mistakes and invite trouble for themselves unless the British government takes a more resolute stance and shows clear means of retaliation. Whether it is appropriate or possible for the British government to take a more resolute stance at this time is still a question, but the British people in Tianjin feel indignant at the authorities' perfunctory attempts, or because the authorities have no means to remove them.</p>

<p>Wishing the final victory of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) Before the opening of the Chongqing Children's Day celebration on April 4th, twelve children were selected to pay respects to Chairman Lin, President Chiang and his wife, Commander-in-Chief Liu, Mayor Wu, and Chairman Hong.

Commander-in-Chief Liu encouraged the children to study hard and prepare to participate in the War of Resistance and gave each of them a bag of candy. At 11:00 AM, they paid respects to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu encouraged them in three things: (1) Do not develop selfish and self-serving ideas. (2) Do not harbor regional or native place concepts. (3) Fully exercise the body. Before leaving, Mayor Wu gave each of them a bag of candy and a self-edited diary. At 11:30 AM, Chairman Hong led them to pay respects to the President and the President's wife. The President encouraged them to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation and to follow the items listed in the Party member code and aspire to be good people. Madame Chiang said that there are now many refugees from the war zones who have been sent from the orphanages to ordinary schools to study, and everyone must not despise them, because they are all poor brothers and sisters who have been forced to leave their homes and leave their parents. At the same time, we Chinese people should not only not despise them, but also love them. When they left, each of the children was given a package of candy and several oranges. At 12:00 PM, they paid respects to Chairman Hong. At 4:00 PM, they paid respects to Chairman Lin. At 5:00 PM, they paid respects to President Kong of the China Children's Welfare Association. They all had speeches to offer when they paid respects to each official. The content of the speech to Chairman Lin was roughly divided into three points: (1) Since Chairman Lin has guided the military and civilians of the country to resist Japan for three years, there is already a sense of victory. It is believed that in the near future, the Japanese will be driven out. (2) The children in the occupied areas have been rescued by the government and not only have clothes to wear and food to eat, but also have books to read. (3) All the children in China are willing to work hard under the leadership of the Chairman to prepare to be the reserve army for the War of Resistance. Chairman Kong, Vice President, and Chairman Hong all encouraged them to study hard, step up their training, and prepare to participate in the long-term War of Resistance, and gave them gifts. When the children left, each of them was overjoyed.</p>

<h3>10,000-Meter Long-Distance Championship: Wang Zhenglin Wins the Qingguang Cup; Time is 34 Minutes and 12 Seconds; Runner-Up Li Duan is 400 Yards Behind</h3>
<p>The "Qingguang Cup" 10,000-meter Chinese-Western Championship, organized by the Qingguang Sports Association, started at 8:00 AM yesterday at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. More than 80 Chinese and Western athletes participated in the competition. Unfortunately, Ding could not participate. Although the British soldiers Grimms and Tumonk drove to the finish line, they still missed the registration, which weakened the competitiveness a lot. As a result, veteran Wang Zhenglin had a smooth ride. Because there was a lack of competition along the way, he failed to break the association's standard of 30 minutes. The runner-up was Li Duan, about 400 yards behind. After the race, Mr. Yan Keping, the president of the association, presented the awards. The Qingguang Cup was retained by Wang Zhenglin for one session. The long-distance race, which was once very popular, came to an end.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, a line of people moved forward on Jing'an Temple Road. After 100 yards, the veteran Wang stood out. Hai Lou advanced shoulder to shoulder. Passing Yiding Road, the veteran was like a horse off the leash, rushing forward. Hai Lou knew it was difficult and retreated, and Wan Jinsheng replaced him. Du'an and Pei Gong flew side by side. Liu Guangfa's illness had not recovered, and he was behind the others. Arriving at Kaixuan Road and Yuqing Road, half of the entire journey had passed. The veteran had a smooth ride. Reaching Daxi Road, Wang Zhenglin ran more and more bravely. Near the finish line of Weihaiwei Er'ming Road, the veteran stepped up his powerful sprint, leading the first person by more than 400 yards, and won the Qingguang Cup championship of this session.</p>

<h3>Both Concessions Curb Rising Prices - Essential Goods Must Be Marked with Prices - The Aim Is to Encourage Shop Owners to Suppress Prices - Monopolization and Manipulation Will Be Prosecuted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Bulletin No. 5233, stating, "The full text of the bulletin and the list of essential goods are attached separately." The purpose of requiring price tags and price lists for various essential goods is to make it easier for citizens to identify and purchase the cheapest items. On the one hand, it encourages shops to do their best to keep prices down in order to attract customers. In addition, the authorities in both concessions plan to publish a price comparison table for various districts in the city every week to facilitate citizen purchases. All of these measures are taken by the authorities to improve people's livelihoods. These measures are only a part of improving people's livelihoods. The real solution still lies in the abolition of various restrictions and taxes in the interior and the smooth transport of supplies from the production areas to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Greatest Cause of Rising Prices</p>
<p>Most citizens attribute the current high prices to merchants' direct or indirect hoarding, manipulation, and speculation. But, in all fairness, the real cause is not something that merchants or municipal authorities can control. For example, all kinds of goods come from the interior, which is not only suffering from war but also under military occupation. The experts hired by the Council to study and prevent merchants' hoarding and other such matters seem to have done their best at present.</p>
<p>Essential Goods - Difficult to Set Price Limits</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the essential goods listed in the attached table are easily perishable. The so-called market price can only be applied to the direct resale of these goods from producers to consumers. The price of various goods, such as vegetables, fluctuates daily according to the principle of supply and demand. It is impossible to set a price on a daily basis unless the quantity supplied each day can be determined before the market opens. Furthermore, setting a price one week in advance would lead to many abuses. As for setting different prices for the same item, it would easily lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation with the French Concession</p>
<p>On February 29th, the Bureau organized a Price Control Committee to study the measures adopted by the French Concession authorities to control prices in the Public Concession. In March, the Committee suggested to the Bureau that the price control measures to be adopted by the Bureau should be as similar as possible to those adopted by the French Concession authorities. Subsequently, on March 13th, the Bureau issued a bulletin prohibiting the hoarding, manipulation, and speculation of rice and various necessities. Those who do not comply will be prosecuted according to law once discovered. The food problem has been carefully studied and closely cooperated with the French Concession authorities. It is hoped that the various measures currently promulgated by the Bureau will be effective in improving the grain market in this city.</p>
<p>Price Tags - Will Be Reviewed</p>
<p>Before merchants have sufficient time to affix price tags and display price lists, citizens are asked not to report hoarding, speculation, and manipulation to the Bureau's police or health departments. Such reports will be reviewed by the Committee in the future.</p>

<p>The list of essential goods stipulated by the French Concession is roughly the same as that of the Public Concession, so it is omitted here.</p>
<h3>French Concession Levies Ordinary Professional License Tax - Nature Seems Redundant - Lawyers and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Express Dissent - Taxpayers' Association Has Negotiated with the French Authorities</h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau has begun collecting ordinary professional license tax from this year. Lawyers and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are all subject to the tax. Considering its nature, it is similar to the business license tax and seems redundant. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners' Association, and other organizations have successively sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to reason with the French Concession authorities and strive to revoke the order. The Taxpayers' Association has asked the Chinese directors of the French Concession to negotiate separately and has also sent a letter to the French Concession Public Works Bureau, stating:</p>
<p>Lawyers and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Have Obligations</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, According to a letter from the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, District Committee Branch, it is stated that members of the Association have reported that the French Concession Public Works Bureau has begun collecting ordinary professional license tax from this year, and lawyers are also subject to the tax. This kind of harsh levy greatly harms the interests of all members. Please negotiate reasonably to achieve the goal of revocation, etc. Based on this, lawyers perform their duties to protect human rights. In the event of major criminal cases, the court generally needs to appoint lawyers to provide mandatory defense. This is significantly different from general professions that are purely for profit. We hereby request your Association to quickly make reasonable arguments, etc. Also, according to a letter from the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners' Association, it is stated that members of the Association have reported that members have already obtained a special professional license from the French Concession for practicing medicine in the French Concession and have paid annual donations. Now they have received a notice from the Finance Department of the Public Works Bureau to collect ordinary professional license tax, which is inevitably redundant and unbearable. Please negotiate, etc. Upon arrival, we found that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are by no means comparable to ordinary industrial and commercial businesses. They often provide free medical care and medicine, which is obviously inconsistent with Article 1 of the ordinary professional license regulations. According to the provisions of Articles 2 and 4, they should be exempt from the license. We sincerely request your Association to ask the French Concession authorities not to collect ordinary professional license tax from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to avoid redundancy, etc. Approved.</p>
<p>Please Exempt from Double Taxation - So as to Comply with Regulations</p>
<p>We believe that lawyers perform their duties, all to protect human rights and safeguard legal benefits, which is one of the three major duties of the judiciary. Also, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners perform their business, and their nature is similar to that of lawyers. They are all committed to protecting human health. These are not comparable to those who are purely for profit. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 1 of your Bureau's ordinary professional license regulations, which states that individuals or organizations are for their own account and for profit. Furthermore, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who practice medicine in the French Concession, in addition to obtaining a registration license from your Bureau's Health Department, also obtain a business license from the Donation Department and pay business license tax. If an ordinary professional license tax is levied again, it will conflict with the provisions of Article 4 of the ordinary professional license regulations, resulting in redundancy. We hereby inform you of the situation and sincerely request that lawyers, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and other professionals of the same nature be included in the list of those exempt from ordinary professional licenses, so as to comply with regulations and lighten the burden. We hope you will investigate and reply.</p>
<h3>US Flagship Augusta to Sail to Shanghai Next Week - Admiral Hart Expected to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to official sources, the US Asiatic Fleet's 10,000-ton flagship Augusta will sail to Shanghai next week. The Augusta left Shanghai last November and sailed south. Also, Admiral Hart's wife and her three daughters arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday aboard the President Cleveland. Hart is currently in Manila and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-May. In addition, the US transport ship Henderson will arrive here on May 1 with 300 US Navy personnel to rotate with the US troops stationed in this city, so that they can return to the US to participate in summer training. It is estimated that about 270 Navy personnel will leave Shanghai on the ship and return to the US at that time. In addition, the US transport ship Chaumont will visit Shanghai three times a year. This is one of the new plans of the US Asiatic Fleet.</p>
<h3>Public Buses Increase Fares - Effective Today - Five Cents for One Stop - Eight Cents for Two Stops</h3>
<p>Due to the sharp depreciation of foreign exchange and soaring gasoline prices, the original fares of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company of the Public Concession were difficult to maintain. Therefore, with the approval of the Municipal Council, an increase in fares will be implemented from today. The new fare calculation standard is approximately 6.5 cents per mile, with the following regulations: five cents for one stop, eight cents for two stops, twelve cents for three stops, fifteen cents for four stops, eighteen cents for five stops, twenty-three cents for six stops, twenty-five cents for seven stops, twenty-eight cents for eight stops, and thirty-three cents for nine stops. If it exceeds one stop but is less than two stops, it will also be calculated as two stops. According to the new fares, the first route, which is seven stops, costs 25 cents for the entire journey; the second route, which is nine stops, costs 33 cents for the entire journey; the fifth route, which is two stops, costs eight cents for the entire journey; the seventh route, which is five stops, costs 18 cents for the entire journey; the ninth route, which is eight stops, costs 28 cents for the entire journey; the tenth route, which is five stops, costs 18 cents for the entire journey; the twelfth route, which is eight stops, costs 28 cents for the entire journey; the fourteenth route, which is six stops, costs 23 cents for the entire journey; the fifteenth route, which is four stops, costs 15 cents for the entire journey; the seventeenth route, which is three stops, costs 12 cents for the entire journey. It is heard that the French-owned Water and Electricity Company's electric trams and public buses have also applied to the Public Works Bureau for an increase in fares to maintain operations because the British-owned trams and public buses have already increased prices.</p>
<h3>China Buddhist Association - Moves Office to Chongqing</h3>
<p>The China Buddhist Association, located at Juewen Cloister, 418 Hart Road, was formerly presided over by Master Yuanying. According to news from Chongqing, the Association first moved from Shanghai to Ningbo and has now moved from Ningbo to Chongqing. The Association's affairs are all presided over by National Master Zhangjia, Master Shengwen, Layman Qu Xie, and others. They plan to actively reorganize the provincial branches based on the new regulations. Therefore, the China Buddhist Association in this city lacks a presiding officer and has virtually ceased to exist.</p>

<h3>Annual Review of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps - Ceremony Held at 3 PM Yesterday - Chinese Company and Translation Company to Serve as Flag Guard</h3>
<p>The annual review ceremony of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession was held at 3 PM yesterday. The outgoing Chairman of the Board, Mr. Fessenden, served as the reviewing commander. Colonel Baker of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, Commander Simons of the British Army, Commander Gasville of the French Army, and the Japanese Army Commander accompanied the review. Colonel Hong Pei, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, served as the commander. The reviewing platform was set up in the open space in front of the Shanghai Club at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xujiahui Road. Diplomats and military generals from various countries stationed in Shanghai, Western and Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, and others were invited to attend the ceremony. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Teams</p>
<p>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters, Shanghai Mounted Troop, US Mounted Troop, Military Band, Headquarters of A Company, A Troop, B Troop, Scottish Troop, Jewish Troop, Anti-Aircraft Artillery Troop, Headquarters of B Company, US Troop, Portuguese Troop, Philippine Troop, US Machine Gun Troop, and the Flag Guard jointly organized by the Chinese Company and Translation Company, Headquarters of C Company, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Troops. Except for the 3rd Troop, which is composed of White Russian volunteers, the rest are paid White Russians, Signal Troop, Armored Car Troop, C Company Machine Gun Troop, Translation Troop, Transport Engineering Troop, Armored Car Troop, Light Artillery Troop, Transport Troop, and six units of armed vehicle patrols. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, all of the above-mentioned troops assembled separately at the Racecourse Baseball Field. At 2:45 PM, they started from the Longfei Gate exit on Ma Huo Road, passed through Nanjing Road and Chengdu Road, and were reviewed by the reviewing commander, Mr. Fessenden, and others on the reviewing platform. The troops were well-organized and marched in unison. The review was completed after half an hour.</p>
<p>Forming the Flag Guard</p>
<p>The Flag Guard was previously appointed from among the members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This year, it was jointly organized by the Chinese Company and the Translation Company, which is the first time in the history of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps that it has been staffed by Chinese members. It was jointly organized by 52 members of the Chinese Company and the Translation Company and led by Major Chen Shixia, commander of the Chinese and Translation Companies, with Lieutenants Zhou Qingen and Xu Shaomei as his deputies. As for the Chinese Company, it was led by Lieutenant Yu Xianen, deputy commander of the company, with Lieutenants Li Li and Zhang Tinggui as his deputies. The Translation Company was led by Lieutenant Wang Tingkui, deputy commander of the company, with Lieutenants Xia Ranyu and Zhong Wuting as his deputies.</p>
<h3>1,000 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported Back to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Red Cross Ship No. 160 left Shanghai for Japan early this morning. It is heard that the ship was carrying about 1,000 Japanese wounded soldiers from the front line to be treated in Japan.</p>
<h3>Annual Review of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps: A Quick Sketch Beside the Reviewing Stand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, fifty-seven years ago—April 14, 1883—marked the first annual review in the history of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps. At that time, the entire force, combining "officers" and "soldiers," totaled only one hundred and seventy-six men. Yesterday, at 3 PM, in front of the Shanghai Club at the Xujiahui Road (now Hengshan Road) and Nandan Road intersection, the number of personnel who marched past the reviewing stand, including cavalry, infantry, and transport units, was about a hundred times greater. It can be seen that the progress of the SVC is directly proportional to the prosperity and progress of Shanghai over the years.</p>
<p>The review ground was set up in front of the Shanghai Club at the Xujiahui Road (now Hengshan Road) and Nandan Road intersection—near the East Xujiahui Road and Huangjiasha tram station. Starting at 2 PM, several rows of people stood on both sides of the sidewalk along Xujiahui Road, from the racetrack in the east to the intersection of Xujiahui and Nandan Road in the west. The crowd was dense and lively. The distance between these two streets symbolized the growth, density, and thickness of Shanghai's population, seemingly surpassing Denmark by a generation. —Denmark's population is three million eight hundred thousand.</p>
<p>In the opera excerpt "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao," isn't there a line, "Seeing an old man sitting by the roadside"? Yesterday, in front of the Shanghai Club at the Xujiahui Road and Nandan Road intersection, and along the roads on both sides of the Wuyu Lane, many seats were arranged, with men, women, old, and young, both Chinese and foreigners, all sitting "by the roadside." Trolley cars on the second route and buses on routes one, fourteen, and fifteen continued to travel among the seated people before traffic was completely cut off. Especially, the buses often stopped very close to the roadside, and some of the small children sitting in the front row, because of their short stature, seemed shorter than the thick, large tires. One child, sitting directly in front of a wheel and dressed in bright clothes, became an excellent pictorial composition. A Westerner sitting on a double-decker bus, taking advantage of a brief stop, was loudly conversing with a plump lady sitting "by the roadside." In short, the people on the bus had a strange feeling looking at the people sitting on the sidewalks, and the audience sitting on the stand inevitably became the target of their gazes.</p>
<p>The reviewing stand was set up in the middle of the road, with grandstands behind and to the sides. The one marked with the letter J was the grandstand for the diplomatic corps and the members of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Like the reviewing stand, its base was surrounded by red and blue silk cloth to show solemnity. At precisely 3 PM, Mr. Fessenden, the outgoing Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, walked onto the reviewing stand, and the Shanghai Municipal Council flag, with a red emblem on a white background, was immediately hoisted on the nearby flagpole. Just as his body was standing upright, and the flag had just been raised to the top of the mast, fluttering in the wind, it was very pleasing to the eye, and coordinated very well with Mr. Fessenden's high hat and dark suit. At this time, looking east towards the racetrack, one could faintly see three white horses approaching. Western policemen riding horses and Indian policemen wearing red turbans continuously patrolled, acting as forerunners. Chinese and Western volunteers serving as sentries were also particularly busy, trying their best to restrain the spectators on the sidewalk within the roped-off area.</p>
<p>After Mr. Fessenden took the stand, the commanders of the British, American, French, and Japanese garrisons stationed in Shanghai, a total of six people, followed onto the field. They were relaxed and smiling. In a group interwoven with red hats, white hats, black uniforms, and yellow military uniforms of various colors, everyone shook hands and exchanged greetings. For a time, this reviewing stand, only a few feet square, was filled with an atmosphere of international harmony. Chairman Fessenden, with his dignified demeanor, led the group, standing in front, his spotless white collar paired with a dark brown tie, and a purple flower inserted in his left lapel, echoing the corner of a white handkerchief poking out diagonally. Three or four minutes after he took the stand, the three officers of the Volunteer Corps Headquarters riding white horses appeared before them. The commander shouted the order "Left—Dress!" and the cavalrymen who followed each paid attention to Mr. Fessenden, and those holding swords performed the sword salute. Mr. Fessenden removed his top hat, pressed it to his chest with his right hand, and, as the crowd applauded, watched intently as the parade passed by.</p>
<p>The procession began with the cavalry and ended with the transport vehicles. The British Royal Leinster Regiment band stood on the road opposite the reviewing stand, playing music, which invigorated everyone. From the first horse passing the reviewing stand to the last truck, it took about twenty minutes. People in military uniforms and carrying guns were walking in the middle of the road, high-ranking foreign military and political personnel from Shanghai were standing on the reviewing stand, and men, women, old, and young, Chinese and Westerners, were sitting calmly in the grandstands and on the sidewalks. Including those who stopped at both ends, waiting for the traffic jam to clear in buses, trams, rickshaws, and those walking on horses, and those watching the excitement on the roofs of residential buildings and shops near the Shanghai Club… In these twenty minutes, apart from the clear spring sky with faint sunlight that could be seen by looking up, everything around, moving and still, showed that the Shanghai International Settlement was a place completely filled with people.</p>
<h3>Foreign Troops Stationed in Shanghai Inspected Today; Farewell to French Military Commander Colonel Gascoigne Who is About to Return Home; French Troops Inspected and Awarded Medals Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported that French Garrison Commander Colonel Gascoigne is about to return home. The commanders of the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai have each dispatched a company of soldiers to assemble at the Racecourse at 10:00 AM today for Colonel Gascoigne to review, to show their respect.</p>
<p>Awarding of Medals</p>
<p>At 9:15 AM yesterday morning, the various units of the French troops stationed in Shanghai gathered at the Gujiazhai Park training ground for a review, as noted in yesterday's newspaper. At that time, a company of marines from the "Garnier" warship, three companies of colonial infantry, and two auxiliary squads of Russian detectives from the French Concession Police participated, standing on three sides, with the fourth side being the seats for naval and military officers. Colonel Gascoigne arrived, and the military band played music to salute him. Captain Fleurquin and Lieutenant Bouet accompanied him to inspect the troops. Then, the officers went to the middle of the training ground to participate in the ceremony where Colonel Gascoigne awarded Captain Fleurquin a medal. After the ceremony, they paraded in formation, with tanks participating.</p>
<p>Tea Party Held</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM the day before yesterday (the 13th), Colonel and Mrs. Gascoigne also held a tea party at the French Club, inviting members of the diplomatic community in Shanghai. Commanders of the armed forces stationed in various countries, military attachés, consulate personnel, and officials from the British and French Concessions attended, with hundreds of guests, making it a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Tan Shaoliang's Coffin Sealed Yesterday; Chinese Detective Killed by Gunfire Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 9:05 AM the day before yesterday, when Tan Shaoliang, a Cantonese man and the director of the Second Section of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, was assassinated on Weihaiwei Road (today Weihai Road), a Chinese detective, No. 2556, was also shot in the abdomen. He was seriously injured and sent to the Shanhaiguan Road Police Hospital for treatment, but his injuries were too severe, and he died at 6:45 AM yesterday morning. It is also learned that the body of Tan Shaoliang, who was assassinated, was placed in a coffin at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Police lowered its flag to half-mast to mourn him.</p>
<h3>The Nanshi Branch of the "Central Market" Still Difficult to Open; The Iron Gates of the 16 Pootung Pier Have Not Yet Been Opened</h3>
<p>For more than half a year, the Japanese and puppet regimes have been plotting to control all local goods in Shanghai and planned to establish puppet "Central Markets" on Route Tenant de Possesse (today Middle Huaihai Road) and a Nanshi branch. Currently, the first two locations have gradually opened. The Nanshi location was originally scheduled to open today, but because the French Concession authorities have not yet opened the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier, it has become another pipe dream. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Today Still Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>The Nanshi branch of the "Central Market" is located near the Ning Shao Pier in Nanshi. Since the establishment of the "Central Market" and the Route Tenant de Possesse branch, the Japanese and puppet regimes have been actively preparing for the opening of the Nanshi branch. On one hand, they have been trying their best to request the French Concession authorities to open the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier to facilitate the transportation of local goods. On the other hand, they have been speeding up the arrangement of the "market." Several vegetable markets have already been set up inside the branch, but the decoration has not yet been completed and is being expedited. The branch was originally scheduled to officially open today, and there was a rumor that the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier would also open today, but according to reliable sources, the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier will not open today, so it is still difficult for the Nanshi branch to open.</p>
<p>Local Goods Merchants Refuse to Participate</p>
<p>However, the Japanese and puppet regimes are still preparing to open the Nanshi branch in the short term, so they are now using unemployed people in the local goods industry to entice and coerce merchants from the 16 Pootung Pier and other places to participate. It is reported that the Japanese and puppet regimes have sent people to entice and coerce local goods merchants at the 16 Pootung Pier to register and have stipulated that the "deposit" for the pier is 100,000 yuan. Depending on the size of the local goods business, each company is assigned 3,000 to 5,000 yuan as a guarantee for participation. The method is the same as the "Central Market." According to sources from local goods merchants yesterday, although the Nanshi branch will open in the short term, only a few small-scale local goods merchants have registered so far, and the number is very small. Most of the larger-scale local goods merchants have refused to register. Taking the "Central Market" as an example, they will not rashly join in order to avoid trouble.</p>
<h3>Tram and Bus Scrip to Be Recalled; Official Announcement Soon</h3>
<p>Aluminum one-cent and five-cent coins have been circulating in the Shanghai Special Administrative Region. The bus and tram companies issued fare scrip to temporarily remedy the shortage of small change. Now that small change is abundant and circulating in Shanghai, in order to respect China's monetary system, it has been decided to stop issuing scrip and to recall all scrip that has already been issued in a short period of time. It is heard that the authorities of the companies concerned will issue an official announcement soon.</p>
<h3>Free Epidemic Prevention Injections; Campaign to Be Held from the 15th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has scheduled a free epidemic prevention injection campaign for residents starting on the 15th of this month. There will be four injection sites in the Western District, two in the Central District, and one each in the Northeastern districts, as listed below:</p>
<p>Residents who wish to receive epidemic prevention injections can apply for free injections at the above-mentioned branches. However, Saturdays afternoons, Sundays, and public holidays are excluded. Residents who wish to obtain epidemic prevention injection certificates for local use can apply to the above-mentioned branches. Those who wish to apply for such certificates because they are leaving Shanghai are only allowed to apply to the Health Branch at 340 Hankou Road (today Hankou Road). Factories that want to have their workers vaccinated should request in writing that the Health Branch dispatch a mobile epidemic prevention team to provide injections between the 15th of this month and the 15th of next month, but only for factories with 100 or 120 or more workers who will be vaccinated at the same time. In addition, groups that wish to obtain epidemic prevention injections and have their own doctors provide the injections may apply to the Health Department in writing for approval.</p>
<h3>Public Discussion in the Knitting Industry on Sales Methods among Members</h3>
<p>The Knitting Industry Association, in view of the recent erratic fluctuations in the price of raw materials, and if remedial measures are not taken quickly, all knitting factories will be seriously threatened. In order to adjust the legitimate business of both parties and prevent manipulation and speculation, the industry has jointly agreed on the following business methods: (1) For customers who have requested additional goods from members of the association before today, whether orally or in writing, but have not entered into a formal contract, all the goods must be paid for in cash by the 20th of this month to sign a formal contract. Otherwise, this one-sided additional order will not be considered a firm order and will be invalid. (2) Those who have paid a portion of the goods but have not entered into a formal contract should also make up the remaining payment within the aforementioned deadline. Otherwise, the goods will be shipped according to the amount paid. (3) Formal contracts that have been signed by both parties will be handled according to the terms listed in the contract. In the future, additional goods must be formally contracted and a deposit of more than 50% of the total amount must be paid in advance to be valid.</p>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>The Coal and Firewood Bathhouse Industry Requests Assistance in Supplying Coal at Fair Prices; Representatives were sent to large coal companies such as Ewo Yuen, etc., to quickly supply cheap coal. It is learned that the Coal Industry Association has already forwarded letters to the three coal companies, Ewo Yuen, Wah Chong, and Yuan Tai. The three companies have expressed agreement and will act accordingly, supplying the public bathhouses with coal at fair prices. The Coal Industry Association has decided to sell the fourth batch of coal at fair prices. It is heard that the price will still be 50 yuan per ton, and each household will be limited to one ton while supplies last.</p>
<p>Ocean Rice Shipped to Ningbo; Shipping Management Office</p>
<p>Replied to the Three Northern Provinces and Shanghai Native Relief Committee that your committee purchased a large quantity of ocean rice and specially chartered the Ruithai Wheel to transport it to Ningbo to relieve the people's food shortage and benefit the hometown, which has been ordered by the superiors, and the Ruithai Wheel is specially approved to sail directly into port.</p>

<h3>Married Woman Sues Paternal Uncle and Others for Encroachment; Lawsuit Dismissed for Being Time-Barred</h3>
<p>After the death of Xie Zinan, a wealthy merchant from Huzhou, he left behind three sons, named Weiqing, Siting, and Zhisun. Siting and Zhisun also passed away successively. The large amount of inheritance left behind was not divided, but was jointly managed by Xie Weiqing and Siting's son Shengzu (father named Zhaoji) and Zhisun's son Bingru. Then, Xie Yunzhen, Siting's daughter (married to Li Yunsun), filed a lawsuit in 1937 against the administrators to demand payment of the inheritance.</p>
<p>After a definitive judgment was issued, it was determined that Xie Yunzhen should be given one-twentieth of all of Xie Zinan's estate after deducting the debts. Since the judgment, the administrators have first cleared the debts. Unexpectedly, Xie Yunzhen suddenly hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of a court against her paternal uncle Xie Weiqing, her elder brother Xie Shengzu, and her cousin Xie Bingru for encroachment and damage.</p>
<p>Claiming Encroachment of Creditor's Rights</p>
<p>Stating that Xie had disposed of 460 shares of Hong Kong Union Insurance Company stock worth over 75,000 yuan without authorization, and had also hidden the rental receipts for the buildings in Daoda Lane managed by Daoda Company, etc. Xie Weiqing and others also hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend, stating that the sale of the Hong Kong Union Insurance Company's stock was actually due to the poor financial turnover of the Tenth China First Knitting Factory property in the joint property.</p>
<p>Lack of Funding</p>
<p>And had no choice but to do so, but the eight shares that Xie Yunzhen should inherit were still reserved, and what was sold belonged to the defendants' own inherited shares. As for the Daoda Lane management part, because the bookkeeper Zou Zhaowen disappeared during the August 13th Incident, most of the rental receipt stubs managed by him were not handed over and could not be found after searching everywhere. It was reported to the execution office, and these items are specific items and cannot be replaced by other items, so the plaintiff's claim is simply</p>
<p>Cannot Be Established</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was found that the case was a prosecution-dependent case, with a statute of limitations of six months. Now that the statutory time limit has been exceeded, they have no right to sue according to law and should be asked to dismiss the complaint. After the court summoned them yesterday, the result was that the court recognized that the plaintiff's claim was time-barred and ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Du Baoru Transferred to the Special Division of the High Court</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Baoru, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, was previously ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to work in the civil division of the Third Branch of the High Court in Shanghai. He has now been ordered by the ministry to transfer Mr. Du to the Shanghai Special Division of the Supreme Court as a prosecutor. Mr. Du has taken office in accordance with the order.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Arrested; Several Young Girls Rescued</h3>
<p>Huishi Police Station Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detective Liu Shuxun, and Detective Yang Xichen received a secret tip from an informant at about 3:00 AM yesterday morning that a large number of kidnappers were hiding at No. 62, Lane 510, Rue Amiral Courbet (today Middle Huaihai Road), so they coordinated with Western detectives to rush to the address. They arrested five people from Suzhou: Yu Yuanliang, Jiang Changgen, Shen Nanshan, and women Yu Hua and Shen Yu. They rescued Suzhou girls Zou Ami (16 years old), Hua Aying (16 years old), Wang Baobao (17 years old), Shandong girl Shen Yunbao (16 years old), Yu Juzhen (16 years old), and Yu Awu (13 years old). They were all taken to the police station and sent to the Third Criminal Division of the court yesterday. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested a period for investigation. Then, Chinese and Western detectives explained the case details. After Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated Yu Yuanliang and the other five defendants, their confessions were evasive, and they were remanded in custody for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Young Couple Sues Each Other; One Wants Separation, One Wants Cohabitation</h3>
<p>Gao Jinquan, a local young man residing at No. 24, Lane 730, Avenue Dubail (today Middle Huaihai Road) in the French Concession, (22 years old, currently studying at Guanghua Middle School,) recently hired lawyer Wang Henggu to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the Second Special Court against his abandoned wife, Zhu Zhengyan (18 years old this year, from Zhoupu, Pudong, currently residing at No. 28, Hepingfang, Kaifeng Road), requesting cohabitation. It is claimed that the plaintiff married the defendant through matchmakers Yan Guanfu and Wang Wenda in March of last year. Unexpectedly, after the defendant entered the house, she was restless and made excuses to return to Ningbo, taking away her clothes, leaving the suitcases empty. In November, she left again and has not returned since. Despite repeated urgings, there has been no effect. Therefore, he requested the court to order the defendant to return home immediately to cohabit. According to the lawsuit, Judge Yu from the Civil Seventh Division summoned them yesterday. The plaintiff testified as above. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Jian'e to appear in court and submitted a defense, stating that the plaintiff disliked the defendant's poverty and became disgusted. First, there was cold sarcasm and ridicule, and then all kinds of abuse, often causing pain. On July 1 last year, the defendant attempted to commit suicide by taking Lysol and drowning herself after being beaten by the plaintiff. Fortunately, her family discovered it and sent her to the hospital for treatment. There is a case to refer to. Moreover, the defendant has also filed a separate suit in your court, so he requested that the cases be consolidated. The court adjourned the matter and instructed that it be rescheduled after verification.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller Killed in Accident</h3>
<p>At 8:30 PM last night, an eighteen route trolleybus (car number 163) running on Henan Road and Laobaidu Road (today Renmin Road and East Yan'an Road) had its conductor, Wu Chengsheng, from Jiangbei, 30 years old, number 133, chatting with a passenger on the trolleybus behind buying a ticket, and his head was sticking out of the window. The car was going very fast, causing his head to hit a utility pole on the side of the road, causing his brain to rupture and blood to gush out like a spring. An ambulance was urgently called to fly the injured to the Jishi Hospital, but he died before treatment could be administered.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>Chen Jinbao, a local man, 28 years old, with no occupation, went to the Nanjing Hotel at No. 36, Hongyunfang, Avenue Edward VII (today East Nanjing Road) in the French Concession with a woman surnamed Wang (26 years old) at 9 PM the other night. The two claimed to be husband and wife and rented the room for the night. After one night, the woman went out the next morning and did not return. Chen slept alone in the room. At 7 PM in the evening, he had not yet gotten up, and the room attendant entered the room to check on him, only to find that Chen had committed suicide by drinking poison and had already died. The woman surnamed Wang, who stayed with him overnight, has not visited the hotel to inquire, nor has any family member come to claim the body. According to general speculation, this woman is likely a prostitute. The deceased had long intended to commit suicide, called a prostitute to celebrate one last night, and finally committed suicide to end his life.</p>
<p>Zhu Honglai, a six-year-old girl from Shaoxing, living in a bungalow at No. 855 Lane, Chenjia Lane, Xihai Road (today West Nanjing Road), was playing by the pond in front of her house alone at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. She accidentally fell into the water and was immediately discovered and rescued, but she was already unconscious. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died shortly after.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shirong Opens Clinic</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Shirong, a graduate of St. John's University, has opened a clinic inside the Lizhi Pharmacy at No. 811 Nanjing Road (today East Nanjing Road) on the 15th of this month. He will be available for consultation from 1 to 4 PM every day. After 5 PM, he will be available for consultation at No. 80 Jiujiang Road (today Jiujiang Road). It is heard that Dr. Zhang aims to serve the community, so he has set the consultation fees very low, and he is especially willing to provide convenience to the sick and poor.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, saying that the weather in Shandong is clear with a turning and moderate northwest to north wind. It is cloudy here with a northwest wind or light breeze. There is a north to east wind south of Ma'an Island, with fog falling in several places. Also, in the 14 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 61.5 degrees and the lowest was 44.6 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 58.8 degrees and the lowest was 54.7 degrees.</p>
<h3>Mei Shaoxiong's Embezzlement Case Resolved Through Settlement; Appeal to the Third Instance Remanded for Retrial; Both Parties Settle and Withdraw Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Mei Shaoxiong, a Cantonese man and the owner of Mei Sheng Jihao, residing at No. 196, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road (today West Nanjing Road), was hired by Zhen Feng Dongji Sugar Company at No. 17 Yong'an Street (today Central Shandong Road) in the spring of 1937 to serve as the head of business in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces for the company. After half a year, Mei handled business introductions of about 800,000 yuan. Later, due to disagreements between the two parties, Mei resigned. He Jing, the manager of Zhen Feng Sugar Company, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the Second Special Court, accusing Mei of embezzlement, stating that Mei had 700,000 yuan in accounts in his hands.</p>
<p>Unsettled Procedures; Mei also hired lawyer Ge Zhiqin to file a lawsuit in the court, countersuing He Jing for false accusation, claiming that He wanted to embezzle his huge commission and fabricated facts. The initial judgment found both parties not guilty. Both parties refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the criminal division of the Third Branch of the High Court at the same time. As a result of the trial, Judge Wu sentenced Mei to a fine of 500 yuan. Mei still did not accept the judgment and appealed again to the Supreme Court. After reviewing the case, Weng Jing, the presiding judge of the Shanghai Special Division of the Supreme Court, believed that the criminal division of the Third Branch of the High Court's sentencing of Mei Shaoxiong to a fine seemed inappropriate, so he sent it back to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for</p>
<p>Further Retrial; The appellant He Jing suddenly entrusted a friend to mediate with Mei, willing to compensate Mei for litigation losses of 1,000 yuan in national currency, and the commission portion should be calculated as before. And both parties withdrew the lawsuit and jointly issued a statement in the newspaper to clarify the misunderstanding. The huge embezzlement case that had been entangled for more than a year has finally come to an end.</p>
<h3>Old Newspaper Excerpts, Sixty-Seven Years Ago (355) (From the Shun Pao, Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Relief Tickets for Healing</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Henan relief donation campaign, it was originally intended to issue one receipt per household. Later, receipts were drawn by household. By June and July, many households in the Suzhou area had received receipts, even to the extent that a donation of 200 cash was divided into two households. Whenever people came with money, they didn't say they were donating for relief, but that they were "obtaining a ticket," which seemed strange. When asked why, they replied, "For healing." What kind of healing? Burning the relief ticket to ashes and taking it with water. Some said that tickets without a surname were most effective, while others said that general tickets were most effective. This was particularly common in Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Xishui and other counties, and also widely believed in Jiaxing, Zhejiang. Last month, Mrs. Zhang from Kunshan specially hired a boat to Suzhou and donated 140 yuan.</p>
<p>Aiding Relief Through Gambling</p>
<p>Gambling is a trivial matter. We often gather at the Simei Xuan in Yuyuan Garden during our leisure time to enjoy tea, and often play chess. Occasionally, we gamble to decide who pays for the wine. When the mood is high, the friendship is deep. However, considering the recent relief donations, if we simply use the gambling money for daily expenses, we would feel guilty. Therefore, from March 1st, we will donate the gambling winnings. Neither the winnings nor losses will be returned, and the money will not be discounted. Once two yuan is collected, it will be handed over to the office. The receipts will be posted in the Xuan for public viewing, which is truly a refined and profound gesture.</p>
<p>A Peak Flies Away</p>
<p>The thirty-six peaks of Huangshan Mountain have long been known as scenic spots, recorded in historical records. Scholars and poets who visited there came one after another. However, this year, one peak suddenly flew away. It is said that the local officials have already reported this matter to the higher authorities in detail. Changes in hills and valleys have been common since ancient times. This peak probably collapsed due to its age, which is not surprising.</p>

<h3>Self-Management of the Shanghai Market (Part 2) —Summary of the Third Symposium of This Publication—</h3>
<p>Date: March 31, 1940, 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Attendees: (Signatures in no particular order)</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: After speculative capital withdraws from the commodity speculation stage, prices will naturally tend to stabilize. But that's just stability. To suppress and level them, it is still necessary to solve the source problem. If you want to manage it, then you must know that what Mr. Yang Yao said about those difficulties is indeed the actual situation of the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>Chairman: Now we only hear about production and sales cooperation, but not about production, sales, and consumer cooperation. I think the work of managing prices must be achieved through cooperation from all three parties. For agricultural products, it is already very difficult to obtain the cooperation of farmers. Now there are more obstacles from the Japanese and puppet regimes, so it is even more difficult. But no matter what, the sales and consumer aspects must still cooperate. This approach is certainly very difficult, but at this time and place, this is the only way to unite against the outside.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: In theory, production, sales, and consumers are "coexistent and prosperous." But in reality, consumers are always exploited.</p>
<p>Chairman: The consumers I'm talking about are not limited to the final consumer. For example, hardware importers, wholesalers, and retailers act as the sales side, while the construction industry, various processing industries, etc., which have a large demand for hardware, act as the consumer side. They can form a combination, establish price agreements, and even distribution agreements to prevent competitive purchasing or free speculation. It is best for each industry association to participate in the combination as a unit.</p>
<p>Chairman: When this type of combination becomes widespread, competitive purchasing will be reduced. Therefore, the pressure on foreign exchange will be reduced invisibly. At least it can prevent the exchange market from being stimulated and fluctuating due to competitive settlement.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: This approach is too idealistic. (1) The current social economy is a free system. (2) Without political power as a backing, organizations can never be widespread. (3) The industry association itself is just a signboard. At most, there are only a few secretaries inside who can accomplish anything? (4) The leaders in the industry association are, in fact, the leaders of the industry. They have strong power, so the interests of their actions are particularly large. The established rules may not be followed by everyone. Sometimes even those leaders themselves do not abide by them. (5) The uses of various goods are actually extremely complicated. Therefore, it is impossible to get related parties to form distribution agreements or price agreements.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: Perhaps the procurement of important goods should be concentrated in the hands of the chamber of commerce or the industry association of each industry. The chamber of commerce or industry association of each industry should be organized into a large-scale procurement agency and wholesale agency. Thus, for incoming prices, considerable control can be exercised. Wholesale prices can of course be regulated. Retail prices will not have much difference.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: The industry association price may be higher than the market price. Then wouldn't the industry association incur losses?</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: If the market price is lower than the industry association price, the industry association does not have to supply.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: Wouldn't this be suspected of hoarding?</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: In fact, the cost of group procurement is always lower than individual procurement. So the industry association price is not actually more expensive than the market price.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: The organization needs a lot of funds. The source should be resolved.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: Please cooperate with the banking industry association.</p>
<p>Chairman: At this time, the banking industry association should clearly stipulate that each bank and shop must no longer engage in goods collateral transactions with private individuals. All collateral transactions must be made with the organization as the counterparty. Those who violate this agreement should be severely sanctioned. At the same time, each organization can also refer to the joint reserve system of the banking industry and the system of submitting reserves for the use of interbank transfer certificates, etc., and submit reserve funds to the organization as a deposit for purchasing goods from the organization. This can also slightly reduce the financial burden on the business of each merchant. Therefore, they will be happy to participate.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: Should private transactions outside the market be prohibited?</p>
<p>Chairman: That's not necessary. If there are off-market transactions, the price should be lower than the industry association price. If the off-market transaction price is more expensive than the industry association price, then the industry association's supply capacity is probably in trouble. That is serious.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: So we should achieve unlimited supply. However, if the off-market price is lower than the industry association price, it may not be necessary to supply.</p>
<p>Chairman: What I fear is that people will act selfishly and give convenience to companies they are related to in hoarding large quantities, thereby sacrificing the interests of the public. Therefore, if centralized procurement can be achieved, distribution agreements should be further handled. At the same time, a supervisory body should also be organized, with fair-minded people from outside the industry participating.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: Here I also feel that there are three difficulties: (1) The industry association itself lacks talent. (2) How will the losses or profits incurred during the operation of the industry association be handled? (3) Commercial profits and losses depend entirely on access to information. How will they obtain this information?</p>
<p>Chairman: This organization is, in fact, no different from a cartel. Therefore, the leaders of each industry will certainly not be willing to stay out of it, and the participating member merchants will not be willing to lag behind. As for the results of the operation, there should be no losses. As Brother Youfei said: If the cloth price is lower than the industry association price, the industry association can honestly and politely not supply. Although this has the suspicion of manipulation, as long as his industry association price does not include manipulative profits, that is, illegal profits. However, legitimate profits should also be recognized. It is best to use this type of income as a balancing fund, so that the benefits are still returned to the public. As for information, it should actually be easier to obtain than when operating individually. Moreover, since the industry association price is leading the market price, the relationship of timely information is also relatively less important. However, which industries should we start with? It is worth studying.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: Of course, we should start with daily necessities first.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: But the types of goods are extremely complicated, and the quality of the same goods also varies greatly. Therefore, the establishment of industry association prices is actually still difficult. Therefore, which industries should we start with? It is still worth studying. I think the decision should be based on two principles: (1) It can be purchased in large quantities and meets the needs of the public. Only by purchasing in large quantities can we supply in large quantities, so that the industry association price can gain the right to lead the market price. (2) When setting industry association prices, it is also necessary to implement a standard commodity system, and at the same time, it is best not to use technical selection. So like rice, coal briquettes, flour, oil, salt, etc., we can try to implement them first. That is to say: the grain industry, the distillery industry, the fuel industry, etc., should be tried first.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Adjustment and Self-Defense Measures</p>
<p>If the balance of supply and demand is not maintained, the effectiveness of price policies cannot be guaranteed. This city is actually considered an industrial area, but the source of raw materials is either the remnants flowing out of the hands of the Japanese and puppet regimes, or it must accept the heavy burden of foreign exchange. Moreover, there is no freedom to obtain it. This is not only true for raw materials, but also for all non-industrial products such as grain!</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: Hoarding is one of the root causes of disrupting the balance of supply and demand. Eliminating hoarding and speculation will also increase the possibility of balancing supply and demand.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: I think that if speculative capital is used properly, the relationship between supply and demand of goods can also achieve the principle of balance.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: This should start with correcting the city's industrial policy. If the city's factories are relocated to the southwest, the raw material problem will not be so serious!</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: A friend of mine recently published an article in the Ta Kung Pao entitled "A Simple Choice." For the various difficult questions raised by the general public, he only gave a simple answer, that is, "Victory in the War of Resistance, any difficulty can be solved easily."</p>
<p>Chairman: If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? Enduring all the hardships of wartime is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, just like bearing the costs of war.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: Thrift is conducive to balancing prices, and it also affects the balance of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: Except for those who make war money and new rich, I'm afraid there is nothing to save and nothing to cut back.</p>
<p>Chairman: Savings in the cost of living, which are targeted at the petty bourgeoisie, are still worth advocating. The nouveau riche are not interested.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: Taking Shanghai as an example, we should break the vanity of saving face. Friends who are strong on the outside but weak on the inside should not show off any more.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: This can be promoted like a movement to promote integrity and shame.</p>
<p>Chairman: After the May Fourth Movement, there were many thrift societies, moral advancement societies, and other organizations that focused on personal cultivation and rationalizing life in various places. Now they should be revived. In addition to saving living expenses, it is also worth advocating for raw material savings, the research and promotion of substitute products. Raw material savings are closely related to correcting industrial policy. For example, running a silk factory in Shanghai is not only doing business with the "Central China Silk Company," but it is also a dead end. It is better to transform its machinery and equipment and switch to other production.</p>
<p>Wei Youfei: It is best to move to western Zhejiang, eastern Jiangsu, or even Chengdu. Otherwise, raw materials will still be a problem.</p>
<p>Chairman: From the perspective of balancing international payments, enriching people's livelihoods, and strengthening national power, the principle of "Buy Chinese Goods First" should still be firmly maintained. However, domestic products under the control of the enemy have actually changed in nature. Therefore, when the rice crisis occurred at the beginning, this publication advocated for joint purchase of foreign rice. This is not only to smash the other party's monopoly, attack their exploitation from the middle, and reduce their attempts to absorb legal tender to disrupt foreign exchange, but also to open a possible way to improve supply sources. However, what people generally call "opening up supply sources" always means wanting to negotiate with the Japanese and puppet regimes. In fact, this kind of negotiation is what the enemy hopes to hold.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: This will increase the burden on the exchange market. If Wang Haibo's speculative capital can find a reasonable outlet and withdraw from the exchange market, this burden will not be a big deal.</p>
<p>Chairman: What I mean is a principle of complementing domestic goods with foreign goods. Importing foreign goods is a means, and obtaining domestic goods is the goal. During the skyrocketing rice prices last winter, residents in the concessions were all determined to eat foreign rice. Moreover, they were indeed ordering foreign rice one after another, and rice produced in the occupied areas was also transported to Shanghai. As for cotton, why wouldn't it be the same? But silk is different because there is no market for fresh cocoons abroad; the only way is to rely on the occupied areas. Therefore, the degree of the skyrocketing silk prices is particularly fierce. Therefore, it is feared that changing industries is the most beneficial way for silk factories under the industrial policies of Shanghai. (Continued below)</p>
<h3>Black Market Prices in Japan</h3>
<p>—Yu</p>
<p>The war of aggression against China, which has lasted for more than thirty months, has long exhausted Japan's economy. No matter how its government implements violent control and blocks its news, making it impossible for the suffering of its people to be leaked, the panic has become extremely serious and cannot be concealed. Therefore, its magazines and newspapers have also leaked cries of sorrow from time to time. For example, its commodity market, due to the implementation of price controls and rationing controls, has long seen the emergence of a black market; however, it has been banned from being published. However, the Tokyo Economist magazine, published on February 21 of this year, blatantly contained the black market prices of several kinds of goods. This is not a neglect of those who control the news; I think that what is contained in the magazine is still lighter than the actual situation. Although, if compared with its official prices, there is a world of difference, as shown in the following table (unit: Japanese yen)</p>
<h3>Introduction to Universal New Style Account Forms of Kung Sheung Certified Public Accountants</h3>
<p>—Pan Xulun</p>
<p>The application of new accounting systems in industrial and commercial enterprises in our country is generally limited to large-scale manufacturers. Smaller-scale manufacturers mostly follow old habits and use old systems. Manufacturers are not unaware of the advantages of the new accounting system, but they still use the old system. The obstacles are nothing more than two points: the difficulty of finding talent, and the cost of system design and account book printing. The so-called difficulty of finding talent is that manufacturers want to change their system and hire specialists, but if they are not familiar with old-style business practices, there will be many obstacles. As for Chinese-style account books, the price is lower, and account books of the same format can often be used for multiple purposes. A manufacturer that uses 20 account books a year will spend no more than 40 or 50 yuan. If new account books are used, planning the format is not something everyone can do, and once the planning is complete, the printing cost of one or two dozen account books is often more than one or two hundred yuan, which is much more inconvenient than using the old system.</p>
<p>In order to remedy the above two difficulties, people in our accounting profession have made many efforts. The accounting tutorial school I established may be of some convenience to industrial and commercial employees who study accounting in their spare time. In the past four or five years, Mr. Xu Yongzuo has advocated improving Chinese-style bookkeeping. Based on the size of industrial and commercial enterprises and the differences in business types, he has formulated several standard systems. Thus, the work of planning the old-style industrial and commercial accounting system has been greatly reduced. Mr. Xu then printed the various account book formats in the formulated system into several types of account books, so that the account books of industrial and commercial enterprises could be supplied centrally, and the cost of account books in various industries was reduced. However, the system set by Mr. Xu is still an improved Chinese style, not a completely Western style, so the supply is limited to one aspect and has not been popularized in businesses that use Western-style systems.</p>
<p>This year, the Shanghai Kung Sheung Certified Public Accountants designed "Universal New Style Account Forms," which are centrally printed and supplied in large quantities. As a result, businesses that use Western-style account books have also gained great convenience. I read the sample account forms of that office and saw that there are several styles of vouchers (transfer slips), receipts, journals, cash books, and classification books, which are very well designed. Those who use the new accounting system in various industries can learn about the system of accounting from the "Introduction to the Application of Universal New Style Account Forms of Kung Sheung Certified Public Accountants" compiled by the office, thus saving the labor of planning the system. And the account forms used can be purchased at a low price, so there is no need to print them specially, which would result in a large amount of printing costs. With this convenience, what kind of obstacles are there for new-style accounting in the industrial and commercial sectors? As for the easy-to-handle work, what kind of obstacles are there? As a result, I am happy to see the promotion of accounting reform in my country's industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Securities: New York Shipyard Shares Rise to a New High</h3>
<p>New York, 13th. Today's stock market trend is slightly better. There are no other news in the market. The increased orders and outstanding orders received by the shipyard have caused this stock to reach a new high. The iron center reports a lower working schedule, but this is offset by the price drop.</p>
<h3>Rubber: Market Situation Calm</h3>
<p>New York, 13th. The rubber market is calm. Arrivals are decreasing, while prices are rising. There are signs of a lack of cabin space and increased water feet. The market should respond quickly.</p>
<h3>Grain: American Wheat Trading Quiet</h3>
<p>Chicago, 13th. News about the wheat market and the new war is scarce. Trading became sluggish as brokerage houses absorbed sales from Chicago and local groups.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Wind of Hoarding Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market was quiet due to the Sunday holiday. According to general opinion, the expansion of the European war will cause hardware prices to rise again, leading to a resurgence of hoarding.

<p>Hygiene for Both Sexes</p>
<h3>Couples of the Era</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Should Understand the Harm of Misusing the Body</p>
<p>To obtain happiness in marriage and produce offspring to continue the lineage, the first question is whether the bodies are healthy. Originally, the union of men and women is for the exchange of love. The development of this love naturally requires healthy reproductive functions for happiness to be possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, male and female reproductive work is not a shameful thing. If we all seek the ideal of completely detaching ourselves from the physical, we will soon see the extinction of all mankind. Humans are, after all, one of the biological beings. The biological world naturally has two major desires: one is the appetite, and the other is the reproductive desire. These two major desires should be satisfied by us in accordance with the principles of hygiene. If we misuse the body or ignorantly injure the sexual functions related to happiness, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>From the life of a couple, one can see the importance of healthy sexual function. It not only brings forth new life, but also, through its medium, the two sexes love and help each other, laying the foundation for love, increasing spiritual understanding, and all sources of happiness can be obtained inexhaustibly from healthy reproductive functions. However, losing the health of this reproductive function yields the opposite result.</p>
<p>Therefore, love between men and women will naturally arise after sexual contact between the two parties. Men, except for complete impotence, can fully enjoy it, but women are not so fortunate. The reproductive pleasure they receive is entirely in the hands of their husbands. If they encounter a husband who is physically weak, has premature ejaculation, or is impotent and underdeveloped, then the sweet dream will vanish.</p>
<p>Such problems of premature ejaculation and weakness should not be left untreated. As for the causes of such diseases, in addition to excessive masturbation and early marriage, they are mainly due to indulgence and licentiousness after marriage. At this time, one should actively take male "Bu Ti Kang", a preparation made from the sperm essence of strong animal testicles, to restore the original healthy physiology. "Bu Ti Kang" was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Meulen. In addition to the sperm essence of strong animal testicles as the main ingredient, it also contains phosphorus for brain nourishment, iron for blood nourishment, and calcium for bone nourishment. Therefore, it functions to promote the prosperity of every cell and nourish the whole body. It is most effective for treating premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdeveloped genitals. Its female "Bu Ti Kang" functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility, with miraculous effects.</p>
<h3>Explanation of New Gonorrhea Medication</h3>
<p>— Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang, PhD (USA)</p>
<p>Modern medicine is scientific medicine, and everything must be based on (1) science. Today, the market is flooded with gonorrhea medications, often with cleverly invented names, always labeling their names as new drugs to attract attention and seek sales. As a result, patients not only waste money in vain but also delay treatment. This is because the treatment of gonorrhea, whether new or old, always aims to fundamentally resolve the pathogen of gonorrhea, because the patient's purpose is to relieve their pain, regardless of whether the drug is new or old. For example, the specific medicine for syphilis, "606," was invented decades ago and is still the leader among syphilis drugs. No matter how new the newly produced syphilis drugs are, they are difficult to match "606." We can now use the same reason to explain that "Ke Lin Nong" (available in Chinese and English) is an authority among oral medications for gonorrhea. "Ke Lin Nong" is the result of Dr. Peter of Germany devoting more than 30 years of his efforts, going through countless failures, countless improvements, and trial results, finally achieving the final success and inventing the "Ke Lin Nong" drug, which has been around for many years. Its position in the treatment of gonorrhea is like the brilliance of 606 in the treatment of syphilis, lasting and new, using actual efficacy to defeat all false new brand inferior drugs. For all acute initial gonorrhea and chronic old gonorrhea, only need to take "Ke Lin Nong" medicine, and effective results can be seen within four hours, because the anti-gonorrhea and antibacterial effects of "Ke Lin Nong" reach the lesion directly with the circulation of blood, anti-killing gonorrhea bacteria, and other general brand new inferior drugs, once entering the digestive organs, are excreted from the body, only stimulating the stomach and intestines and having nothing to do with the treatment of gonorrhea. Therefore, from the standpoint of our medical experts, the newest gonorrhea medicine is only "Ke Lin Nong" enough to be worthy of it, and other so-called new drugs are just verbal terms.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Impotence and Offspring</h3>
<p>— Zheng, PhD (Germany)</p>
<p>Patient Zou ××, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, lives in Yongkang Lane, Alabaster Road, New Garbage Bridge, Shanghai (chief complaint) - unmarried at the age of twenty-nine, due to getting married too early and excessive sexual activity. Since marriage, in addition to a daughter who died young, he has not had children for thirteen years. He suffers from nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, impotence, and weak erections, and viscous secretions flow out after urination. In recent years, his body has become weaker, his spirit is sluggish, and the love between husband and wife is not good. He begs for treatment. (Treatment process) - Prostate massage, electrotherapy for fifteen minutes every day, cold water friction on the local area before going to bed, and taking three "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop nocturnal emission, and during the day, male "Bu Ti Kang", a strong animal testicular sperm essence tonic, was given in three doses in the morning, noon, and evening to nourish yin and tonify the kidneys. A total of two months of medication, sixty-five electrotherapy sessions, and cold water massage were maintained for a long time. The above-mentioned symptoms of weakness gradually disappeared. He felt energetic in the morning, his appetite increased, and his genitals were strongly erected. He had intercourse twice in the meantime, and he said that he had completely restored his reproductive function. Last month, Mr. Zou introduced his friend to the clinic, and he said: His wife is already five months pregnant, and he expressed his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Case of Tuberculosis Treatment</h3>
<p>— Diagnosis by Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Qian Xueliang, from Songjiang, is 41 years old (self-report). He has been weak since childhood and likes to drink. Two years ago, in winter, he attended a friend's wedding banquet and returned drunk. At that time, it was late at night, and he caught a cold. Since then, he has been coughing incessantly. By last spring, there was a lot of thick phlegm and chest pain. Although he had been treated, it was ineffective. Last fall, there was a sudden discovery of blood spots in the phlegm, and he was sweating profusely at night, so he came to me for treatment. (Treatment process) I observed that Mr. Qian's face was pale, he was as thin as a stick, and he had a high fever. An X-ray examination revealed a silver coin-sized cavity in his right lung lobe. I instructed him to abstain from alcohol and eat nutritious food and rest at home. "Bu Fei Na Er" was given to make up for the cavities. After two months, the cough had been cured, and the chest pain and night sweats were gone. Taking it to this day, all symptoms have disappeared, no blood in the sputum has been found, and health has been restored.</p>
<p>Talks on Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Special Treatment for Gonorrheal Cystitis</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrheal cystitis is caused by improper and inferior surgical procedures for local washing in patients with acute or chronic gonorrhea, or by holding urine and engaging in sexual intercourse in chronic gonorrhea. All of these can cause gonococci to invade the internal bladder. Patients experience pain in the lower abdomen, frequent urination, turbid urine, and even blood in the urine. Day after day, the virus becomes very strong. If it is not treated early, the original bacteria of gonorrhea will further invade the kidneys, resulting in gonorrheal pyelonephritis. In this way, the disease becomes more serious. Rescue must be swift, because the spread of gonorrhea is becoming more and more serious, and there is a risk of complications. However, one must be cautious about such treatments. If general local therapies or transmucosal bactericidal therapies are used again, they will not help, and there will be a risk of making repeated mistakes. Be careful.</p>
<p>In short, the sooner gonorrheal cystitis is treated, the better. For the treatment of gonorrheal cystitis, I first use scientific methods to examine the location of the lesion, and after diagnosing the location of the lesion, I use the specific gonorrhea medicine "Ke Lin Nong" (available in Chinese and English), and German static electricity therapy, X-ray electrotherapy, etc., are used in combination. In this way, cystitis in acute gonorrhea can be cured in two weeks, and if it has become chronic cystitis, it can also be cured in three or four weeks. I have twenty years of experience in the treatment of gonorrhea, and whether it is internal medicine, surgery, or electrotherapy, I can treat it according to the symptoms and achieve rapid results. After the above treatment methods, the symptoms of gonorrheal cystitis can be quickly reduced or even cured in a short period of time, and there is no failure. Clinic hours: 10 am to 6 pm. From today, twenty numbers are sent to the clinic every day, and each number only costs five cents, and a copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan is given.</p>

<h3>Transportation in Shaoxing</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Since Xiaoshan, which is as closely related to Shaoxing as lips are to teeth, has fallen, Shaoxing has inevitably been affected. Although the market was once calm, it has now recovered its prosperity. Let me talk about transportation in Shaoxing.</p>
<p>Shaoxing has many rivers, so boat traffic is particularly developed. Wealthy families always have boats, like small chartered cars in Shanghai. Farming families have at least one small boat of their own. In addition, there are harbor boats that travel back and forth between the city and the countryside, with fixed routes and berths. As long as you spend a few copper coins, you can take a ride. Because it is cheap and convenient, there are many passengers.</p>
<p>Harbor boats are very large, with rows of long benches inside. There is no first or second class. There are at least two boatmen rowing. A wooden board is inserted on the bow of the boat, with the destination and the places where it stops written on the board. These boats usually come from the countryside and then return in the afternoon. Some of the afternoon departures still row to the city, but they always row back in the evening. Some have to carry burdens because of the long distance. Every morning at nine or ten o'clock, the city gate is sometimes crowded and impassable. They call it "Harbor Boats on the Market." When the boat sets off, the boatman holds a small gong and knocks it while calling out. It gradually stops only after rowing far away.</p>
<p>In addition to harbor boats, there is also a kind of "Jian Jiang Boat." This kind of boat is very small, with two oars, one used by hand and one used by foot. Only three or five people can sit on it. Inside the boat is a straw mat, and the passengers sit on the mat. The boatman rows with his hands and pushes with his feet, very quickly. Because harbor boats have time constraints, people always take this kind of small boat when they miss the bus. Also, because it is fast, people who have urgent matters also need it. However, it is not used when the wind is strong and the river is wide.</p>
<p>As for rickshaws, there are also many in Shaoxing. The rickshaw poles are equipped with bells. If you walk on the road, the noisy ringing will always make you tired. Because there are many rivers, there are also many bridges, and they are very high. When the rickshaw passes over a bridge, the rickshaw puller sometimes asks you if you want to get off the car. For safety, we always get off the car to cross the bridge.</p>
<p>There are not many cars in Shaoxing city, perhaps because there are few roads and many bridges, but compared to the past, there are many more now.</p>
<p>Due to environmental factors, boats and rickshaws have become important means of transportation in Shaoxing, especially boats.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Clothes</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>After old clothes are dyed in a favorite color at a dyeing shop, they are like new. As for the various aspects of dyeing clothes, they are not familiar to outsiders.</p>
<p>The dyes used in dyeing shops are mostly purchased from Xiangnei Gate or Defu. The types and uses are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Direct Union can dye cotton, wool, silk, and other fabrics.</p>
<p>(2) Sulphur Colour can dye cotton fabrics.</p>
<p>(3) Basic Colour can dye wool and silk fabrics.</p>
<p>(4) Basie Colour can dye wool, cotton, and silk fabrics.</p>
<p>(5) Chromc Colour can dye wool fabrics.</p>
<p>(6) Vat Colour can dye wool fabrics.</p>
<p>Among them, Vat Colour is the best. The clothes dyed with this dye will never fade, like the Indanthrene cloth and crepe de chine on the market.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of dyeing clothes, the clothes are usually first immersed in a prepared dye liquid, and then a quantitative amount of sulfuric acid, acetic acid, and salt are added as three dyeing aids. In this way, they are dyed at a temperature of 40 degrees for about half an hour, and finally they are rinsed with warm water and dried.</p>
<p>However, those who work inside are not only exposed to odors, but their hands and faces are also often easily splashed and injured.</p>
<h3>One-Week Economic Menu</h3>

<h3>New Residential Area Under Construction in Guiyang</h3>
<p>— Jing Sheng</p>
<p>Guiyang, known as the mountain country, was not very large to begin with. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, Guiyang has become an important town in the southwest, and its population has suddenly increased more than forty times. As a result, there has been a problem of "housing" difficulties; and after several major bombings by Japanese aircraft, many houses have been destroyed, and the problem of housing has become more serious.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to trying to evacuate the population to other places as much as possible, the Guiyang authorities are also planning to build the scenic area of ​​the Nanming River into a residential area. The planned Nanming River residential area is located in the southwest of Qianling Mountain in the eastern suburbs of Guiyang City, and the Nanming River surrounds it like jade. The area is comparable to the urban area, covering an area of ​​13,900 square meters, divided into 140 households. The construction cost is set at 313,000 yuan, which is entirely allocated from the income from the actual land. If it is insufficient, the government will subsidize it.</p>
<p>The residential area is not allowed to have theaters, hotels, or restaurants, and it is planned to create a clean, peaceful, and ideal new village. In addition to opening a central park in the central location for residents to relax, public places such as small vegetable markets, post offices, libraries, and small schools are built using the stone materials of Qianling Mountain, the fine sand of the Nanming River, and the wood in the mountains; as for water, electricity, docks, streetcars, and other public utilities, there are also complete rules, everything that should be available, as perfect as possible.</p>
<p>This residential area started construction in May of the 27th year and is expected to be completed this autumn. At that time, the ancient Guiyang will be renovated and will have a new look.</p>
<h3>"Fleas" That Should Be Cleared in the Battlefield Are Faster Than Swordsmen and Fiercer Than Lions</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhi</p>
<p>Human life is full of competition. The European War that occurred 25 years ago involved 42 ethnic groups and lasted for four years. In the central cities of the European continent, fleas, bedbugs, and petty clowns rampant and caused disasters wherever the army went, like a prairie fire, with contagious diseases being transmitted to each other. Some say that pests and the fear of insects are the great enemies of human beings. Since the beginning of history to the present day, the struggle between human beings and pests has never ceased. The reproduction of insects is extremely numerous and fast. If they do not devour each other, then the legacy of a few insects, after one or two years, through the derivation and distribution of millions of grandchildren, can cover the Atlantic Ocean. Occasionally, the world and the great war are encountered, and human beings kill each other. Because there is no human defense, pests must take advantage of the opportunity to be aggressive, which is inevitable. The beginning of the Second European War was in the autumn. The scope and speed of the war in the European continent is not as good as in the past. The insect infestation 25 years ago is deeply hoped not to be seen again today. However, in our country, the development of material civilization is not as good as that of Europe. The elimination of insect infestation during the war should be given the same priority as the problem of epidemic prevention. Among the pests, the most resistant is the flea. Insecticidal powders such as "Fly Killing Down" sold on the market are often not enough to repel fleas. European flea experts once said, "Fleas do not choose a place and are very easy to survive. They especially like to gather on the bodies of women. Fleas have six legs. Their two hind legs near the abdomen have sound-producing organs, which can often chirp like grasshoppers, but the chirping is weak and cannot be detected by us. Only fleas can hear it."</p>
<p>Fleas are blind and have poor eyesight, but like bees, they know how to distinguish between light and darkness, and their habits only like to go to dark places. In Western-style homes, the indoor light is sufficient, which is very convenient for preventing the concealment of fleas. Fleas are not good at climbing but good at jumping. A tiny worm can jump as far as 30 centimeters (about one-third of a meter) or even 50 centimeters (half a meter) away, and can also jump as high as 10 centimeters. If a long jump master in our sports world can jump as well as a flea, then he can jump off the ground from the South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and fall into the Shanghai Public Concession Racecourse. Therefore, the flea's jumping ability is even better than that of a swordsman.</p>
<p>Not only that, although fleas are afraid of cold and dry, they are resistant to hunger. If they are in a warm climate and live in a humid place, they can starve for a year without dying. However, they do not eat hungry fleas that have been hungry for a full year. Occasionally, they bite human skin, and they are as fierce as hungry roaring lions. They can ingest half a cubic millimeter of human blood in one frantic suck. If they are not disturbed or chased away, they can stick to it for more than 20 minutes, up to two hours.</p>
<p>People who are troubled by fleas find it difficult to catch them, and it is even more difficult to kill them. A good way to catch fleas is to quickly press the itchy spot and rub it vigorously, or use a wet hand to accurately hold it. The captured fleas cannot be killed by pinching with one finger. If you are afraid of being escaped again in a hurry, you should immediately drown them in water. However, you must not bite them to death with your teeth like the natives of tropical Africa, because you are afraid of accidentally biting dog fleas that affect the human body and infecting the roundworm disease in the dog's intestines. There are many kinds of fleas. In addition to human fleas Pulex irritans, there are also sand fleas, dog fleas, cat fleas, monkey fleas, chicken fleas, rat fleas, and hedgehogs, which are all bred on the ground. However, flat and horse fleas often cover the blankets on horses' backs and can use the smell of horses to repel fleas.</p>
<p>The root of the flea disaster is the most difficult to eradicate. The larvae usually live in the cracks in the floor, relying on the help of humidity to develop. In recent years, Western houses have been equipped with central heaters circulating throughout the room (commonly known as heating pipes). Through winter and spring, the floor becomes dry, which can unknowingly eliminate the flea breeding route. What is even more wonderful is that the floors of Western houses are mostly not washed with water but wiped with oil, and oilcloth is covered on the floor, and thick carpets are laid on the oilcloth. All these facilities are new with the progress of material civilization, all of which are no less than being enemies with fleas. The most exquisite houses have bathrooms and bathe more frequently. How can fleas not disappear?</p>
<p>As for our country, the financial resources may not be enough to lay carpets and install central heaters. If you want to permanently eliminate flea infestation in your home, you may as well buy carbolic acid from Western pharmacies (carbolic acid is poisonous, do not mix a small amount of carbolic acid with 20 parts of clean water (that is, a ratio of 5 to 100) of carbolic acid to form a milky white carbolic acid solution with a strong odor (commonly known as stinky water), take it to pour and wash the floor, deep liquid seeps into the cracks in the floor and the larvae are killed, and the source of fleas is eliminated, not only can the residents of the home rest easy, but also increase the spirit of governing affairs and increase the efficiency of diligent work. As for the invisible pathogens of mite insects, and the plague bacilli smaller than mite insects, etc., all those who rely on the flea body to cause disaster to mankind can be eliminated in one fell swoop, which is a sincere plan.</p>

<h3>Do You Want Your Store to Flourish?</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>An American company once had an owner who specially spent money to have employees learn to "smile." In the eyes of Chinese people, this owner seems so foolish, but the result was that the company's sales increased by 10%.</p>
<p>This may seem strange, but it's not surprising. This is a well-deserved reward for spending money to care for employees! However, short-sighted Chinese businessmen find it hard to realize this. Nowadays, the staff in Chinese companies and shops have low levels of knowledge and are poorly treated. The owners do not care for their employees in any way. The material and spiritual suffering they endure inevitably leads to depression, irritability... which affects business.</p>
<p>Owners of companies and shops! Do you want your business to flourish? This is truly a major issue that cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>Improving treatment can encourage employees to feel secure about their families and focus on their work, and it can also prevent fraud and embezzlement. The boss's care and attention to employees will surely inspire employees' enthusiasm for their work. If the boss can further enhance the knowledge of employees, the result will not only make employees grateful, but also help the business. The cost is extremely minimal, and the gains are enormous. As long as you have foresight, your business will immediately flourish.</p>
<p>Do you want your store to flourish? Your employees are indeed powerful helpers for your success! Pay attention to your employees, care for your employees, help your employees, and treat your employees well. I believe you will definitely succeed!</p>
<h3>Save Them From the Sea of Suffering</h3>
<p>— Inhumane</p>
<p>Hoping to Establish a Special Hospital for Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>I have a relative who contracted a bad habit due to illness. After recovering, he deeply regretted not being able to escape this new "demon." Recently, he made up his mind to quit the bad habit, but his family is not wealthy and he is a salaried employee. Naturally, he cannot afford to go to a more reliable hospital to seek help. So, he secretly searched in the corners of newspapers for cheap doctors who "guarantee to quit opium" and "break addiction in ten days."</p>
<p>Now, nearly three months have passed, and he has already changed three doctors. The methods of the first two almost made him sick again. The latter one, although not painful at all, required taking the medicine as often as smoking. He suspects that the medicine is just a "substitute" and cannot break his addiction. Therefore, he has fallen into a very painful situation.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, under the spread of the poisoning policy, people who are sinking in the sea of suffering should immediately wake up and quit their bad habits. But people like my relative, they don't have extra money to hire reliable doctors, and they have to continue working to maintain their lives. So, they are groping in the dark, trying to escape the sea of suffering but failing.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that all major hospitals should take on this important responsibility. They should add a special department for quitting smoking to serve these poor people. In addition to recovering the cost of the medicine, all handling fees should be waived. For the extremely poor, each hospital should provide a certain number of free places to help them quit. It would be even better if a special hospital for quitting smoking could be established. As for funding, it may be raised from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authorities in the two concessions should pay attention to those irresponsible doctors and all speculative "quit smoking medicines" at any time, conduct investigations and tests, and impose severe penalties if the above situations are discovered.</p>
<h3>Thinking from Tin Foil Ashes</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the thirtieth day of the second lunar month, I saw a pile of tin foil ashes at the door of a house, and then I thought of a story:</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man in England who had a strange habit, and it became a habit, that is, he had to personally burn a one-pound note every day."</p>
<p>Would you be afraid that he has some mental illness? That's what I think too, but after thinking carefully, there is not much difference between him and burning tin foil, but it is just a difference between direct and indirect; fortunately, these outdated things under the times have gradually decreased, but another kind of fashionable and common cigarettes has risen instead, whether it is socializing with guests, making families, social occasions, and even schools, all become smoky; and some people just want to smoke, and the number of people smoking is increasing day by day. I don't know what benefits it has. I only see advertisements in newspapers such as "fragrant and refreshing," "spiritually boosted," "accelerated work," etc. In fact, what doctors tell us daily and what we see in books are all dissuasions and warnings with the opposite intention. Therefore, I can't tell what is different between this and burning tin foil.</p>
<p>I hope that people who smoke cigarettes will not think that my idea is too bizarre. Please think carefully about whether it is harmful without any benefit. Then please reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke until you don't smoke, which will be beneficial to personal health. Although the amount of one person is small, the power of the masses is great. This is beneficial and harmless to both people and oneself. Readers who smoke cigarettes, please think it over carefully.</p>
<h3>Jesus and the City (3)</h3>
<p>(5) Jesus wept for the city. As Jesus approached the city, He saw many other sins. He cried with sorrow for the slums. The crowd was shouting "Hosanna" loudly, but when they heard Jesus weeping, they stopped shouting. Jesus' weeping was not only the weeping of a patriot seeing the impending destruction of his country, but also the weeping of a savior seeing the chosen people He came to redeem tending to destruction. "You did not know the day of your visitation." Jesus came to save them, but they refused to accept Him. The gospel that Jesus brought them, the example He set for them, all of this they did not care about, but instead despised. Therefore, Jesus wept. Now that we see the sins of the city, many people are walking corpses, not knowing right from wrong, we must weep aloud for them. (6) Hurry to make amends. After weeping bitterly, Jesus still felt it was not enough, and immediately went to rescue. He went into the temple and drove out all those who were making the temple a den of thieves. When we see a sin, it is not enough to weep bitterly; we must immediately find ways to remedy it. The first step is to cleanse the church of God, "for judgment must begin at the house of God," because the church is the stream of salvation. If it is blocked by sin, then the life-giving water of saving people will have no way to flow freely. All those who preach according to their own opinions; who are saints on Sundays, but act recklessly on weekdays; who teach people in Sunday school, but swear oaths in the office; who praise God on Sundays, but curse the poor on weekdays; who act righteously in front of people, but do anything behind their backs; all these people, if Jesus saw them, would be driven out. (7) Keep teaching people. After Jesus wept, He taught people in the city every day. For the sins of the city, worldly salvation methods, such as the one mentioned earlier, still do not work; we must still strive in terms of sacrifice. In other words, the city needs education, laws, etc., but even more so the divine word that has the power to transform people. Therefore, we must imitate Jesus and proclaim the holy word every day. Do not preach on Sundays and not on weekdays; do it every day as it should be. May every Christian become a living testimony. If we continue to do this, the city will surely be improved one day. (End) If you would like to inquire in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22 News Reports Fly in from Beyond the Horizon Lofty Discussions and Grand Theories are Believed Among People</p>
<p>Everyone laughed when they saw Shao Huihua's appearance, saying, "She's really a naughty girl." Qu Wubian said, "I believe what Dr. Zhu said. There is a deputy editor in our newspaper office who used to be a war correspondent. In the remote villages and humble houses of the battlefield, news was obtained in this way. With a radio and a mimeograph machine, the day's news could be spread to the public. However, going in and out of gunfire and living a life like the military is arduous, arduous, arduous! It is really different from now. Now, being a journalist, whether it is indoor or outdoor work, is still a life of comfort and ease in society." Zhu Airen said, "People say that newspapers rely on advertising, not on circulation. We don't run newspapers, and we are complete laymen in the news industry. I don't know if this is really the case?" Qu Wubian smiled and said, "Perhaps there was such a phenomenon in the past, but it is not so now. Newspapers still rely on circulation. Even in the era when they relied on advertising, it was indirectly relying on circulation. Think about it, if your newspaper has too few sales, who would come to place advertisements in your paper? Even in our newspaper office, although we cannot obtain much profit from circulation, we do not lose money. There are several reasons for this: First, the price of paper is cheaper. More than ten years ago, Chinese newspapers were foreign goods, and we inevitably suffered losses in foreign exchange and freight. At this moment, there are already several dozens of large and small paper mills in China, and there are also six or seven companies specializing in paper manufacturing. Originally, China has rich forests and convenient water conservancy, which is a good place for papermaking. Why don't we develop it ourselves? Since we use paper from domestic paper mills, the cost is naturally saved a lot, and what's more, several large newspaper offices have cooperative relationships with paper mills. Second, the regulation of paper. Now the largest newspapers at most publish four large sheets. According to the current prosperity of Chinese industry and commerce and the development of culture, even if we publish ten large sheets every day, it is possible. Because of the prosperity of industry and commerce, there are many advertisements, and because of the development of culture, there is no worry about the lack of materials in the newspaper. However, newspapers are read by people every day, and it is not too much to save people's energy. Also, those advertisements are limited to occupying only four-tenths of the paper surface, and the advertising fees are naturally several times higher than before. Third, the government and newspaper offices provide various conveniences. Such as low postal rates, reduced telegram and telephone fees, etc., newspapers are regarded as a national cultural propaganda undertaking, and are given preferential treatment everywhere. This expense is also reduced a lot compared to the past. Combining these factors, the price of paper is cheap, the paper is less, and the consumption is saved. In circulation, it is possible not to lose money. What's more, although advertisements are only allowed to occupy four-tenths of the paper surface, it is still a huge income!" (263)</p>
<p>Dear Editor! I hope this article can be published in Chunqiu. I think that in addition to a small number of people who voluntarily harm their own lives, people like my relative must account for the vast majority. We should cry out for them and save them from the sea of suffering!</p>

<h3>Lamenting General Ming Gong</h3>
<p>— Lan Hui</p>
<p>Spirits of the land gathered in Qilu, For twenty years you opened your office as supreme commander. Through the northern deserts and the Ao Yang Pass, You were called a father and mother of the people. Like Fan and Han, you restrained the enemy's core, A majestic barrier of the golden urn. The Great Wall's horses drank, Shamed to wield the jade axe, The Dadu River was without waves. Who knew that the flames of calamity would fly, The barbarian flute would suddenly sound, How painful that loyal blood splattered, In a hundred battles you led the way. Reading history, I hate the strength of the Xiongnu, Great achievements await inscription on the Yanran Pillar.</p>
<p>Your righteousness reached the clouds, Once, from accumulated labor, you showed illness, Following south of the Yangtze River, the mountains of Yue, the ranges of Brazil, Righteousness forced you to drive. Like Qu and Jia, you threw your poems and sobbed, As the Iron Pledge was issued. You slaughtered whales in the sea, Registered Xun and Ban, Slept in the snow in empty mountains. The imperial army's banners remain unsettled, Family sacrifices are hard to forget, Sadly, the five-zhang star falls, The nine heavens' coffin descends, Feeling the passing of a hero, Following the tears, I newly add the Xian Tablet.</p>
<p>Malaria</p>
<h3>The Most Widely Spread Disease! M.Ch.23 — Jin</h3>
<p>The Method of Taking That Frost Special Effect Rong</p>
<p>Malaria, this disease, is more prone to epidemics in various tropical and subtropical regions. In temperate climates, farmers are more susceptible to its transmission during malaria season. Therefore, it is extremely easy to find its stubbornness in coastal areas and coastal harbors. We must know that "malaria" is a devastating disease, and we must strictly prevent it in our daily lives, because it can destroy our health and cause loss of life. In some places, the discovery of malaria is a huge loss, which can destroy workers and hinder work. Especially in botanical gardens, when workers are working, contracting this disease will reduce work and strongly destroy it. The result is that millions of people live daily and are harmed by malaria. For example, according to statistics from American author Howard in 1909, three million people in the United States were infected with malaria that year, and the cost of death, expenses, and losses was about one-tenth of a million yuan in US dollars. The number is really big, and Ronald Ross calculated that in British India, as many as 1.3 million people die from malaria every year, which is even more terrifying than the United States. Another obvious example is that farmers in Danish East India have also repeatedly been threatened and harmed by it. Although they have tried their best to prevent it, they cannot avoid it and cannot escape its harm. In many other places, problems arise with this disease, such as: "Is it real malaria or not malaria" and "has it been discovered or not discovered". These two questions are parallel and passed on by word of mouth. Everyone luckily tries to believe that it has not been discovered or is not true, so they can rest assured, but many people die among them! According to Professor Garnier of the University of Amsterdam, malaria is the main cause of death among the people of Danish East India and the most widely spread disaster. The professor also strongly determined that we have long discovered drugs to treat malaria to resist it. If you take a certain amount of "quinine frost" when you have malaria, this disease is not a stubborn disease that is difficult to cure. Because of the efficacy of "quinine frost" medicine, it is specially designed to prevent the rampant of malaria. The modern good method for preventing and treating malaria is to quickly eat "quinine frost", which is also the method introduced to the world by the League of Nations Committee for the purpose of preventing and treating the disease. Malaria patients take quinine frost 15-18 watts daily for a period of 5-7 days, and the disease will be cured forever. If you get it again, take the same amount as before, and take a small amount daily during the malaria period to prevent infection.</p>
