<h3 id="c5">荊襄戰局 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日軍强渡漢水而北趨襄樊，南窺荊宜，這是日軍屢次敗績之後，在最近數天內所作的新動態。察其動機，與其謂　侵略軍事上有何價値，母寗謂爲僅出於政治的意義。換句話說，即是用軍事攻勢的姿態，企圖與其政治上的目的相呼應。所以從整個形勢上講，這次日本的進窺襄樊荊宜，仍是政治攻勢的繼續，而不是新軍事攻勢的拾頭。日本自從進佔武漢後，其在西北的戰略，是覬覦潼洛，而窺伺陝甘；其在華中的戰略，是奪取襄樊荊宜，而進謀湘蜀。這中國方面不但從戰略上採行有效的對抗措施，且在作戰上發揮主動的逆襲；故一面守山西以控制河北，一面扼襄樊荊宜以屏障湘蜀；年半以來，使日本的企圖，毫無進展。誠以軍事科學雖隨時代進展，可是地理條件的重要性，古今祇有程度之差，並沒有何種根本的改變。河北爲一大平原，依然是所謂四戰之地；若僅據有河北而未能控制山西，則歷史祗有失敗的紀錄。遠自春秋戰國，例不勝舉，總之地理戰略上山西異常重要，三年來日軍雖入山西，山西却仍在華軍控制之下，而使山西日軍成爲幾條泥腿中的一條。故佔有了河北及豫東，仍未能遵隴海綫而壓迫潼洛。雖經去年八度蠢動，皆以失敗而成段落。華軍却始終堅守潼洛，踞高呼應於晋陝之間。至於襄樊，依軍事地理來說明，則仰有潼洛形成天羅，俯有巴蜀類於地綱，襄樊突入其間，恰如「袋底」；深入袋底，必與甕鼈同其命運。如此說法，絕非詛咒，實爲大自然的美妙結構，而華方將領復能活潑運用之。故從軍事方面觀察，日軍這一决對於襄樊的攻勢，至多博得一種稱道，即具有自投羅綱的勇氣而已。然則何爲而走此下策？</p>
<p>有人檢點日軍在點綫上的進展，統計其成績。他在侵略的最初期，一舉而攫遼吉，再舉而攫黑熱，成績優異。七七之後，中國發動了全面抗戰，情勢便大不相同。淞滬彈丸之地，打了三個月；但同時在華北方面，猶有長足進步，是不必說。其後，從攻陷南京，乃至佔領武漢，每日平均進佔的綫，還有一英里半的長度。自從攻陷武漢以迄攻陷南髯，每日平均進佔的綫却不到一英里的五分之一。自此而後，或進或退，再不能以央里爲計算的單位了。假定此後還能每日平均進佔一英里的五分之一吧，照他們的軍事預算，却必須每日平均耗費五百萬圓。即此侵略成績與財政負担，使日閥不得不要求和平，不得不亟求和平的實現。可是他們既不能澈底理解，祇有放棄侵略，撤回軍隊，纔得和平；又不能目歛野心，却想完成其侵略於政治攻勢之下。政治攻勢亦久而無功，而覘知中國抗戰意念的堅强，日本士氣民心的頹唐渙散，於是異想天開，發爲種種幼稚的嘗試。原來在民族戰爭之中，政治攻勢根本便是幼稚的嘗試，現在則不憚孤注一擲而幼稚之尤。其一，便是賡續轟炸重慶，據似們自已的說明，亦已公然承認轟炸與軍事無關，只希望乞靈於炸彈，以消滅中國的抗戰竟念而已矣。其二，便是模倣閃電戰術，以德國所得成功於波蘭丹麥挪威荷蘭盧森堡比利時諸國的，試之於中國的襄陽樊城荊州宜昌諸城。日本或希望如此轟炸，如此戰術，竟然僥倖而收穫意想不到的大效；在瘋在狀態中的心理，每每以竟想不到的幻境爲可能的現實。但最後事實必予以剴切的敎訓，而在彼獲得敎訓之前，在這嘗試的過程之中，日本方面又未始不希望即此轟炸，即此戰術，亦能使洩了氣的政治攻勢，感受刺激，稍能興奮，亦有何種意想不到的推進。其實，政治攻勢的本質祇是軍事攻勢的附庸；現在想主客易位，反其道而行之，以軍事攻勢作爲政治攻勢的點綴、則其連帶的一敗墮地，是必然的結果，且是極快的歸宿。</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>直到我寫着這一一段時，大家還是在認為至少在一九四〇年春季之前牠不至參戰的這樣一個信念裏，現在回轉來，再略略說明一下，在上面我已約略說過的，義大利在這次德國對英，法戰爭裏的地位，以及對英，法，德等國之間的關係這一點。</p>
<p>先從態度乃面說。</p>
<p>我們觀察英國一般對義大利的態度，比起對於德國來，恰　恰　成為兩個不相同，然而，却是有趣的對照。對德國，英國一般人的態度，大槪有百分之八十，是敵視着的，那剩下的百分之十九點九，是在主張着—也可說是在幻想着，—德國也「可以」成為英國朋友的，可是有一個先決條件，那是：向東歐發展，進攻蘇聯，萬一這個條件不實現呢，那未，這批紳士和貴婦們知道，英，德兩個國家間之衝突，是絕難避免的了，於是，一殺那間，他們先變為沉默，再一變就成了德國的仇人，這裏最適當的例子，是號稱為英國「甚至國際上」親德大集團的所謂「克利夫登系」（Civeden　Set）今年三月裏的關閉，而那裏面的健將，如現任外相哈立法克斯勛爵，現任英國駐美大使羅借恩勛爵，泰晤士報主筆道生（Dawson）等人，却也由之一變，就成了反德的急先鋒，這樣子，在今天，英國一般的態度，反德的，可說存了百分之九十九點九，剩下的百分之點一呢，是盲目的親德人物，這些人物，就是在英國的法西斯黨所謂「不列顚聯盟」（British　union）領導下的一羣非常少數的羣衆，牠的首領毛斯來爵士（Sir　Mosley），一直到今天，還在讓着英，德是「生死相關的朋友」！那末英，德今天明明不是站兩邊，生死相搏的敵對者麼？對這，毛斯來爵士的解釋是：「那是由於國際上猶太人陰謀的結果」！英國一義大利態度，雖然德，義是同盟國，然而，却完全與對德不同，義大利與阿比西尼亞戰時的英，義間結下的宿怨，在英國一般人的心上，現在，是早已完全淡失了，現在呢，我們粗粗地統計一下，大槪有百分之八十，是主張親義的。剩下的百分之二十呢，在通常，大槪無所謂，然而，往往却一下子吐露出反義的意見了，那樣的時候，他或她大槪是聯想到下面三椿事的一件或二件或三件：（一）義大利是德國的盟國，（二）義大利是英國盟邦法國的死對頭，（三）英義在地中海和近東當前的角逐，和將來終將爆發絕對難以調和的矛盾，這二年以來，英國親義主張最盛時，是在去年（一九三八年）春天，當時的外相艾登辭職的前後，這盛時，一直延和到本年（一九三九年）正月，張伯倫訪問羅馬的前夜。西班牙的合法政府及她的獨立自主，就是在這盛時斷送了的！然而，在張伯倫回來後不久，英國親義的態度，就呈了退潮的趨勢，但基本上，當然沒有變，到了這次德與英，法戰開始了以後，英國的一般親義態度，又起了回漲，回漲的原因呢，不用說，是由於想把義大利由「德義軸心」裏拆散出來，表示得最顯的，是近來英國現任海相邱吉爾的幾次　　演說，不過在這裏，有一個値得特別指出來的現象，那是親義態度的高潮，雖是回漲了，但像一九三八年整年內英，義間那種非常頻繁的外交接觸，却並沒有恢復，換句話說，在這次大戰懪發前後，英國却沒有向義大利從事正式拆散德，義軸心的工作，為的什麼？首先，自然是因為英國正集中全力於對德戰事的動員和佈置，無暇　到對的外交；其次的原因，數起來，是由於英，未予在這一點上面態度的强悍。大槪在半年以前吧，那時，身任駐英的義大使格蘭第，有一次，在倫敦的使館招待德義兩國駐英人員的席上，忽然站起來發表了這樣意思的話：「我在這裏說話，是站在我們的死對頭的敵人大本營裏喲」！之張不久，這位大使，受到全英國朝野的指摘，因而就去了職，然而又接着義大利現任法西斯黨總書記的斯他來斯（A.Starace），又公然發表了妙語：「我們不要上當，以為倫敦和巴黎眞會對軸心國家讓步。德義必須認清，祗有用武力，他方能强制執行他們的辦法」，這，令當時抱着和平解決英·義及法·義爭端希望的英國國內的一派人士，受了一個大大的打擊，這兩件，不過是隨手舉出來的典型例子，當然我們必須知道，這一切，絕不是什麼偶然的現象，牠們在說明著，法西斯黨統治下的義大利，對於英·法·是在抱着一個十二分的輕視和囂張的態度的，那表現的程度，還要超過了德國的納粹黨的人們！這一年多以來，大家都知道，德國的現任外長里賓特牲羅甫得勢一日，則英德的邦交，祗有日見惡劣，同樣，我大利現任外長齊亞諾絕無調整的可能。這兩位，是輕視和敵視英·法的兩個選手。而且，照德義的說法，後起的少壯國家，必然的，要漸漸淘汰老朽的國家，所謂「少壯」，是特指著德義兩國；所謂老朽呢，却是特指着英法，這一說法的誔生地，却在義大利，根據了這種懷抱，所以，照義大利法西新黨人們的意見，義大利絕無和英法調整邦交或親善的可能或必要，如果退一步說彼此相安無事，互不相擾呢，那未，義大利是有一個條件的：「滿足義大利天然的願望」，什麼是這所謂「願望」的具體內容呢？「突尼斯·科西加　吉布的」！還有「變地中海為義大利的內海」！</p>
<p>所以，在探查此態度上說，英義之間，在目前，是在南轅北轍地背馳着的。明瞭了這以後，那未，對於在英國雖是親義論又盛囂塵上而並沒有開始什麼特列外步驟的當前奇異現象，也就可以說明了一大半。</p>
<p>可是，為了更進一步的了解，我們不妨再深一層去看。</p>
<p>假如英，義目前開始調整邦交交涉的話，那未，有成功的可能麼？現在，從彼此間的條件上說，就我們知道的而論，大槪也可以斷言牠的絕無成功的可能。大家知道，西班牙內戰時，義大利曾經向英國表示：英，義邦交調整的大前提，是佛朗哥的得勝。因為相信了這，英國張伯倫政府不惜違背了法國意見，忍心斷送了西班牙政府軍。可是當前呢，義大利却又有了另一個新的大前提，那是：「突尼斯，科西加，吉布的！」這些，全是法國的領土。這了這，法國一再表示過，她寗願打仗，也絕不能讓步。那麼，假設英國不顧一切去調整英，義邦交的話，放在她面前的可能途徑，似乎衹有兩個，不是對義默契，於義，法糾紛時不加過問，就是公然以外交壓力加諸法國，令她屈服。如果是前者，那就等於英國退出英，法　盟：不用說，這在當前，是絕對難以辦到的！如果是後者呢，那就是說，英國再忍心出賣法國；這，要是在「張伯倫內閣路綫」完全勝利時，或者還有可能，現在英，德開了戰，蘇，德携着手的時候，而英國又是在目前這個「戰時內閣」主持的局面之下，也是絕對不可能的。所以，在英國這一面說，她實在沒有法子足以滿足義大利的前　條件。再從義大利那一面看。假如她要和英國澈底親善的話，那末，英國的唯一最重要條件，就是她的退出德，義同盟。單是目前這種戰略式的「中立」，　對英，法的害處，比起乾脆參加作戰來，大槪也差不了什麼。然而，我們研究一下義大利對外政策的要點，立刻就可以知道，牠的當前最基本的一點，却就是和德國合作！早上失去德國的聲援，到晚上，義大利在英，法的眼中，大槪就成二等國，這是一；萬一因失去義大利援助因而德國受了潰敗，到那時，義大利帝國主義的歐陸和海外對外擴漲的立中點，就會立刻為之消失，這是二；還有最重要的第三點，德，義式的帝國主義向外擴張，除了受着所有帝國主議共有的物質條件客觀推動外，還要加上　裁者們及其黨徒們的狂妄野心。英，法帝國的形成今天的情形，却完全兩樣，除了努力完成兩個帝國外，還更加努力　，在完成獨裁者的個人！墨索里尼和希特拉合作的最後目的，在於平分世界，當前不過是其中的一個過程而已。他們把眼光向遙遠的地方展望一下，那末，未來需要狼狽奸的地方，還多着哩！所以，義大利這一面，牠也無法滿足英國的最大條件——退出德，義同盟。</p>
<p>到這裏，要順帶說明一件事，近些時來，英，法的與論和宣傳機關，紛紛地，在傳說着，預言着德，義間的分裂。誠然，如果德，義兩國，因了本身的利害衝突，而分手的話，那末，那應該是英，法方面最理想的了。不過，這些分裂的因素，有許多並不是今天忽然出現，而是出來久矣的。這去牠們旣然沒有使德，義分手，今天當然更不會。至於新加人的因素，我們仔細檢討一下，也發現不了有什麼嚴重到使牠們分裂的地步。何况，我們祇要把記憶力刷新一下，那末，立刻就可以發現在我們的記憶的上面，實在是，自從德，義軸心形成的那一天起，一直到今天，幾乎逐日地，都印滿着這一類的說法。所以，德，義間存在着種種分裂的因素，然而，對於當前的義大利與英，法之間的關係，是並相干的。英，法兩國與論宣傳機關的說法，不過是戰時宣傳的一部分而已。那作用呢，充其極左一遍右一遍否認和和闢搖。同時，也就增加了希特拉的戒心，反而促進了德，義關係　的鞏固，這，我們祇要一看近些時來德國要人不斷地訪問義大利，也就可以推測出，德國是在時時用着全力，防止義大利的拆臺。</p>
<p>的確，義大利的終於會不會和德國分手，這一點，對於未壓的歐洲戰局，尤其對於英，法和德國兩方面的生敗之數，關係是太大了。益了更澈底了解這一問題，我們不妨再進一步到牠的根本地方。</p>
<p>現在假定，縱使義大利和英，法兩方面，主觀上，已經覓到了妥協約途徑，那末，她的退出德，義軸心，是可能的麼？</p>

<p>英國路透通訊社總經理張雪樓、昨（九日）從；敎行抵上海、據談國際大局稱、蘇聯似顯已不復有援助德國之意、渠信蘇聯現已停止以物料供給德國、蓋蘇聯抱，防杜歐洲任何國家過趨强盛之政策也、英國對於新任克利浦期爵士為駐蘇大使、頗感欣慰、而料兩國關係將因此大見堆强、至以美國與歐戰關係而論、</p>
<p>並不盼望美國參戰</p>
<p>英國並不盼望美國參戰、美國對於戰事之供獻、端在（一）維持遠東之和平、而注視荷屬東印度之安全、（二）加速其生產、俾以物料接濟英法、戰爭初期、英國過具自信、乃有「吾人可維持自由生活、一方仍對德國作戰」、之說、然至今日、英國已明瞭將臨最危急之關頭、民衆亦奮起決心作戰到底、再新近英國在政治上之變動、已產生良好效果、</p>
<p>英新政府已授特權</p>
<p>民衆完全信任首相邱吉爾、英國會近通過法案、授政府以統制一切人民財產之集中全權、實與德國之希特勒政權相埒、該法案乃英國歷史上最激烈之政治變動、此種集中全權辦法、乃戰時必要之舉、而為全國人民所歡迎者、英國猶如美國、今須加速其戰爭接濟品之生產、故英國現已類如龐大之兵工廠、</p>
<p>遠東政策不致變更</p>
<p>至以英國對遠東政策而論、渠意英國決無承認在政權之可能性、英國對遠東政策、不致變吏、然需美國給予視前更大之合作云、按張氏將在中國勾留一月、然後視察他國境內之路透通訊社分社、</p>

<p>明日移泊浦江河筒</p>
<p>義郵康鐵佛田號、現仍暫時寄椗公和祥碼頭、明日或將移泊浦江浮筒、曾有西報記者、晤該船船長烏哥金嘉、詢問義大利是否將參戰、此船之移泊、殆義即將參戰之微乎、據答、「余僅係一船長不談政治、一切惟墨索里尼首相知之、國民絕對信任首相、吾人惟奉行命令而已」、又問、「遠東與意大利之連絡將斷絕乎」、答稱、「此係客船之最後一艘矣」、</p>
<p>運歐郵件改裝荷輪</p>
<p>此次康鐵佛田號抵滬原定九日照常駛歐、故郵局方面、曾有大批外洋郵件、交由該輪帶往香港、預計行程、可趕上今日由香港起飛之中美·中法·皇家三航綫、茲因該輪突然奉令停航、該項郵件、遂致延擱、除有一部份西南方面之國內郵件、已改裝他輪運港外、其餘外洋郵件、將改裝荷輪芝渣連加號運轉、查該輪已於昨日中午抵埠、載來旅客一千餘人、將於十三日駛返泗水、</p>
<p>中義輪船仍可開航</p>
<p>自義輪奉令停泊各中立國港口後、現仍航行者、僅中義輪船公司之德平輪一艘、蓋該輪船行駛中國沿海、依照國際法規定、在不離中立國三百海里以內、敵國海軍不能加以扣捕也、至中義公司之南洋班輪康沙義·恩德·恩吉·巴度拉等各輪、則於上月杪先後駛入浦江封鎖綫、在南市船塢修理、現尙未竣工、各該輪修竣後、恐一時亦無法復航南洋、故暫時將不擬出塢、</p>

<p>三大幹綫</p>
<p>自上年十一月間、南寗失陷、曾一度發生困難、因南寗為公路及河流輻輳之地、海防起卸貨物、多由汽車載運至邕、桐油亦多經此運往海防出口、但現時中國與國外交通、仍有三大幹綫、一為滇越鐵路、人所共知、無待贅述、二為中緬公路、蔓延達一千一百公里，此路因經過地帶之氣候關係，確為一有價值之道路、惟用以運輸貨物、殊不經濟、據專家之見解、尙不若航空運輸、較為合算、雖不無相當困難、然此路仍照常通行、三為中蘇路、即所謂紅路是也、</p>

<p>（十一）提倡小學生產勞動訓練、生產勞動訓練、敎育部頒小學特種敎育綱要中、原略有規定、蘇敎廳爲特別提倡普遍推行計、特訂定「江蘇省小學生產勞動訓練實施辦　」、買以期各小學實施　項訓練時、咸有切實之計對與方法、務使兒童獲得生產勞動之智識技能興趣與習慣、待以增加抗　建國生產敎育之效率、</p>
<p>（十二）頒發防止及破壞奴化敎育實施辦法、本學期蘇敎廳爲加强淪陷各縣防止及破壞奴化敎育效率、特擬定實施辦法頒令各縣、切實推行、</p>
<p>（十二）增高小學敎師待遇、查本省各縣小學敎師待遇、平昔多半爲十餘元、生活實難維特、値茲抗戰緊張、生活指數增高、薪給數目、固未能適應需要、與時俱增、且有不少縣份、析成發放或積欠累月、本年度各縣編造預算、蘇敎廳即令飭各縣遵照總裁本年一月十六日訓示、務須按照各該縣經濟狀况、儘最大可能、增加敎師待遇、並訂定三項原則、一·維持敎費獨立、二·免除折扣、三·增高待遇、以審核各縣預算、自通令後、各縣敎師待遇、均巳一律提高、比較上年度、的每敎師增加二元至四元不等、如阜寗一縣、甚敎費被地方挪用、僅餘六萬元者、刻已增列至二十萬元之數、此皆蘇敎廳本年維護敎育經費之實徵也、</p>
<p>乙　社會敎育</p>
<p>（一）設立戰時敎流動工作團、設立是團之主要目的、爲適應戰時需要、推行社敎事業、組訓民衆。促進動員、以加强抗建力量、目前暫就蘇省各行政區酌設一團、以區屬各縣爲各團工作之範圍、本學期先就蘇北成立四團、</p>
<p>（二）增設戰時民衆學校、上年度蘇敎廳原巳於江南武進宜興一帶、設立戰時民衆學校五所、本學期又與省黨部合辦戰時民衆學校、於蘇北各縣、普遍設立、計第一步擬設立二十所、並公開徵選民校校長及敎員、又於蘇北創設戰時實騐民校一所、以分期流動普遍施敎爲策進各縣民衆敎育之樞紐、</p>
<p>（三）組設江蘇省圖書館委員會、是會重要之任務、爲規劃全省圖書館事業之推進、尤注重於戰時各地文獻之蒐集、整理典籍、採訪忠烈事蹟、及編纂抗戰史實、其組織除敎育廳廳長秘書主管科科長及編審爲當然委員外，並遴選本省通儒碩學及對於圖書收藏蒐集有豐富經騐或精深研究者五人至七人爲聘任委員、刻已着手組織、開始工作、實爲抗戰期中有關江蘇文化重要之舉、</p>
<p>（四）調整電化敎育巡廻施敎隊、蘇敎廳原設有電化敎育巡廻施敎隊兩隊、惟過去工作、多未能達到預期標準、本學期開始時、特由廳頒訂電化敎育巡廻施敎隊工作大綱詳細規定施敎時、應注意各點期以電化敎育激發民衆抗戰情緒、灌輸民衆建國常識、發揚民族精神、而實施戰時民衆敎育之工作、其所成立之一隊、久已按照所擬計畫、流動蘇北各縣深入鄕村普遍施敎矣、</p>
<p>（五）督促各級學校兼辦社敎、自敎育部頒各級學校兼辦社敎辦法以來、蘇敎廳特加重視、對於所有省縣各級學校兼辦民校以及其他各種社敎設施之考核、異常認眞、除將各校兼辦社敎成績列爲重要考成外、特令省縣督學或敎委於視導時、嚴加考核指導、以期戰時社敎能廣泛推行、並以地方學校爲推行社敎之中心、用費小而成功多、至學校與社會打成一片、又其餘事也、</p>
<p>（六）舉辦各縣巡廻文庫、大戰以來、蘇北各縣所設圖書館、多已停頓、各種書籟、盡皆束之高閣、置諸不用、殊爲可惜、蘇敎廳爲謀適應抗戰需要、增進民衆知識、養成讀書風尙、提高社會文化起見、特限令各縣、應各成立巡廻文庫至少一原、其各縣巳經設立圖書館或農民敎育館者、即附設巡廻文庫於館內、並規定每一文庫、以普遍巡廻鄕鎮爲原則、於巡廻時兼從事演講有關抗戰時事、以堅定民衆抗戰必勝之信念、而引起民衆識字讀書之動機、（完）</p>

<h3 id="c73">端午節與農商 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>中國民間的時節，多與農事有關係，工商隨農事而轉移，端午節即其一例。</p>
<p>端午節在江南一帶，尤爲重視，因爲正在蠶絲麥熟時候。過了這時候，又是雨季來臨，農夫忙於挿秧種田，所以端午節大家樂一下，稍事恢復疲勞，再來從事生產，原爲民間不可少的娛樂。</p>
<p>過時節，最大的目標，就是娛樂。在古時尙含有酬答神明的意義。因爲中國人對於大自然觀察，與各宗敎大致相同，亦以爲最高主宰爲皇犬后土，而一切生活，惟天所賜，可於）靠天吃飯」一語盡之。推人事以言天道，以爲天上神明，亦猶人間之有官吏，各有各職，各司其事，於是田有田公，地有地母，蠶有馬鳴王（其實爲螺祖，故塑女神像），而成爲後世的多神敎。所以凡有收穫，固然要酬神；以爲出於神明保佑；即是無收穫，也要求神明免除災患。其實這一種思想，無論在那一種宗敎之下，都是有的：不過中國民間，崇尙多神，所以每過時節，就得酬神：酬了神，分酢飲福，大樂一番。</p>
<p>端午節旣爲蠶絲麥熟時候。在舊時信用制度盛行之中國，一切買賣，單憑信用。小農制度下之農民，貧苦居多，（這，原因頗複雜）欲向商店購取物品，處處用現錢交易，斷非一般農民所能勝任；如果必欲照此做去，勢必限制農民的購買力，結果亦必與商家不利。故鄕間商店，寗可利益作厚些，賒與民間，等到三節時候，方向農民收回放出去的貨款。而農民亦避免一時支出現金，寗可多出些代價，賒取應用的物品，待他的農產物上塲，換取了錢，償還他的欠帳，那就成爲商業一個結帳期了。</p>
<p>過時節，「一則爲神，一則爲人」，亦是民間流行的一種信條。旣然如此，每逢時節約「吃」，大可以看出這一時期農產情形。用端午節講，吃的是粽子，古時稱爲角黍。南方的粽子，偏是用糯米裏成的，何以舊時稱爲角黍，這可見吃粽子的風氣，由北而南，由來已古。因爲北方不產米，而在古代盛種黍稷，照「月令」所說，五月正是新黍登塲之時，「嘗新」，所以拿黍裹粽子。且黍帶有馨香氣，亦可製酒，當然與糯米一般富有黏性，故適合於裹揑之用。南方不產黍而產米，遂用糯米代替。若是用秔性的米穀，那就小能裹揑在一起。所以裹粽子，非用黍即用糯米，可是黍無糯米的黏，而終於淘汰了！</p>
<p>角黍之角，可是黍無糯米的黏，而終淘汰了！沽的，多爲長方如枕形，這已濅失古意了。</p>
<p>除了粽子之外，吃的有枇杷，帶的有榴花。端午吃枇杷，亦猶立夏吃櫻桃。上海所銷的枇杷，以塘棲紅種白沙枇杷，及來自洞庭山的白沙枇杷爲多，可是今年塘棲枇杷求之不可多得；而市上所售，個形雖大，然非土產良種了。</p>
<p>石榴花開是端陽，故在婦人未剪髮前，每於端午節日，剪一朶鮮紅碧綠的帶葉榴花，挿在靑絲烏雲光澤可鑑之髮髻上，煞是美觀，可惜現已小可多覯了。其實簪花之習，在古代不僅是女子，即男子亦多挿於冠巾或髮髻之上，猶今之西人挿花於衣袋中，用爲裝飾之意。</p>
<p>端午節不但是「嘗新」娛樂，且爲古時的公衆衛生防疫運動。這一重大的意義，到現在雖仍流行着，而巳「數典忘祖」，知其然，不知其所以然，豈不可嘆！</p>
<p>端午在芒種前後，已屆梅雨時節，過了端午之後，正是昆蟲蕃滋，霉蒸暑侵，易釀疫氛的時候。古時的人，不知疫癘能傳染，非歸之於天降之災，即歸之於毒物作崇，所以要驅邪，要辟毒。驅邪，即如五月初一日起張貼道家所繪的符，以及鍾旭的像，這是近於迷信了。辟毒，有如懸掛的萬蒲艾草大蒜之類，焚的蒼朮白芷芸香之屬，飲的是雄黃酒，魘鎭的是五毒，那無一不是直接間接與辟毒防疫有關係的。這裏限於篇幅，不能多所闡述，讀者只要稍事研究，便可知其用意。至於魔鎭一節，亦是中國古巫遺風，原來古靑齊一帶風俗，於榖雨日畫五毒符，即蝎子，蜈蚣蛇虺，蜂，蜮也，各畫一針刺之，家戶張貼，以禳蟲毒，即今之張道家之符，及驅五毒的由來，不行於穀雨，行於端午罷了！舊時新嫁娘於端午節禮，嘗以采緞刺繡成老虎形，於其腹部，綴以蜥蜴，蛇虺，蜘蛛，蜈蚣，蟾蜍之屬，其形稍差，其理則一。蓋毒蟲滋長，爲害於人，故願圖其形以鎭壓之。後　不　，遂娛以五月爲毒月，其實五月何嘗毒，原是用以　毒！</p>
<p>因誤認五月爲毒月，據傳古代對於端午日生的兒女，以爲是毒月毒日，多不加收養。打破這迷信，說是從孟，君田文血起；後以田文貴，凡　午日生的遂皆撫育。據冷　雜添所載，「五月五日生，見之於史書者，如孟嘗君田文，胡廣，張桓侯飛，王鳳，王鎭惡，齊後主，齊南陽王綽，崔信明，宋徽宗，翁應龍，紀邁，遼懿德皇后，趙元昊等」。王鎭惡這名字，大可看出古代對於端午日生的一種觀念。記者亦端午日生，碌　無所表見，有愧古人多矣！</p>
<p>商家往往寫寫月爲端月，以爲端節之月，故稱端月，而不知端月一名稱，本來已有，不過非五月，而用於正月。秦始皇名政，故避諱不稱正月，乃改稱曰端月。端者始也，端月者即一年之第一月也。有以爲正月之正，本應讀如方正之正，後來讀成征伐之征，蓋秦時民間，仍呼正月，惟爲避始皇諱，乃讀正爲征字之音。至於現在稱十月朔爲十月朝，亦是秦時遺傳，蓋朝者爲歲朝之簡稱，因秦建亥月，故以十月初一日爲歲朝，而稱十月朝，相沿迄於今。</p>
<p>停業，無新聞報道，同事囑爲寫幾行，備充篇幅，遂略述端午節與農商之關係；至言其詳，　雙目另有機會補　　。</p>

<p>妻子夜夢走淫！</p>
<p>靑年人常有淫夢顚倒，而患夢遺之症，然而女子也難免有此種現象，以常情而論，未婚而刮靜的處女，尙少此象，有過結婚經臉的女子若感覺丈夫性慾薄弱時，常難避免。</p>
<p>茍丈夫能在性健生活上予妻子以滿足，則決無此種現象，然而有許多男子常於房事進行時，早洩而陰痿，不過他的妻子亦因性慾的微弱，雖感覺興趣索然，而走淫的現象則付缺如，不過性慾異常强盛，或寡婦者，此種現象必不能免。</p>
<p>丈夫性力不振之害，旣如上述，至於其治療方法，也有多種，其最獲確效者，以服雄壯動物睪丸精質（卽靑春腺）製劑（補體康）爲最可靠，照一般的情形而論，陰萎症的釀成，除荒淫及自凟原因之外，還有因憂愁煩惱而致此，故治療之時，亦應顧及其病源，如屬過勞憂愁之故，則應避免肉體及精神之過勞，服以「補體康」本症卽可迅速治愈，比較荒淫自凟所招致之陰萎來得容易解決</p>
<p>如若由年齡漸高之故，可於每日早晨用開水冲服「種體康」一片或兩片，頗有延年益壽之功，且性力可保持至六旬高齡，精神　鑠，耳目淸期，食慾不衰。蓋「補體康」之成份不含雜質，且其採取睪丸請質所撰之動物，完全屬於與人類體質相配的幾種，並用科學方法提煉而來，故毫無副作用，其補力偏重於補腦，補腎，補血的三方面，性質和平，不傷腸胃，故老幼咸宜，誠與市上興奮一時之藥劑，犬相逕庭。女子月經不調須服女用補體康</p>

<h3 id="c85">人能吃草嗎？ <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 草名</p>
<p>草根樹皮只有在災荒的年頭纔會被人你爭我奪，甘之如飴，若在平時則棄若敝屣，曾無一顧之價値。但是實際上草根樹皮含有極豐富的滋養料，有許多動物不是都靠着啃吃野草樹葉過活嗎？它們的惟一缺憾，就是纖維質太粗硬一些，我們嬌嫩的胃口未免有點吃不消。科學家有鑒於此，早在設法補救，最近聽說道方面的研究已吿成功，野草樹葉都將出現在我們餐桌之上，這在米珠薪桂民食艱難的當兒，該是一個聳動視聽的好消息吧！</p>
<p>美國河海河大學巴萊爾敎授曾分析十五種路旁的野草，結果發現它們都含大量的維他命C，其中最豐富的一種叫馬利筋草，其含量超過蔬菜中高踞首座的菠菜竟達八倍之多，其他如商陸，蒲公英，水田芥，酸模草，地湧金蓮等也都有可驚的數字。又美國干薩斯城有高樂爾等幾位化學家經四年不斷的分析和試騐，也有同樣的發現。據他們最近在美國化學會大會席上報吿，穀類植物的葉子含養料最豐富，尤其是維他命成份之高簡直有點駭人；除維他命D外，其他幾乎一應俱全；維他命A比胡蘿蔔多二十三倍；B1比綠葉蔬菜多九倍：B2比萵苣多一十二倍；C比番茄和橘子多十四倍。</p>
<p>這樣富有營養價値的食料，倘若聽其漫山遍野地棄置着，讓畜生們去單獨享受，那眞有點太可惜了。現在高樂爾等已替我們解決了這個問題，他們將小麥，大麥，雀麥等葉子烘乾，漂白，用化學方法處理，然後製成微帶麥精杳味的白色粉末，這種草粉一便成我們的絕好的滋補食品。他們並且親自加以試騐，夫年冬天吃了一季，結果他們的健康都有顯著的增進，傷風咳嗽小毛病完全絕跡，成績十分滿意。現在美國已有三家公司在製造這種『草粉』，估計成本每磅只値六分錢，價廉物美，將來不脛而走，風行一時，自在意料中</p>
<p>直接食用新鮮的草葉也並不是不可能的事，據去年倫敦『聽者』雜誌所載，英國有一位叫勃蘭生的老先生，試吃生草，竟獲意外的成功。他是個退職官吏，歸田後從事於畜植，因此他就有這種奇特嘗試的機會。他從田野間採擷各種嫩草芽葉和生蘿蔔，甜菜根，黃糖共食，習慣了之後，大有『不可一日無此君』之概。兩年以來，老當益壯，精神愈加　鑠，生活的興趣日見增高。一個六十七歲的老頭兒每大早晨還能跑步，甚至一次連踏自由車九十英里而不覺倦，寗非奇蹟</p>
<p>據這位老先生的意見，吃草在農業經濟上更有重大的意義，一畝田倘若種草，生產量可以比種麥大出四五倍呢！</p>

<p>— 林中豪</p>
<p>我們有一句老話，叫做「識時務者爲俊傑」。有人以爲這句話含有毒素，我却不以爲然。這句話如果有毒素的話，那麽一定是被無恥之徒拿出來做搪塞之詞以後，意義被歪曲了，才含有毒素的。</p>
<p>這句話本身，我以爲並無不是之處。</p>
<p>可是有人却因此把出賣民衆的比王認爲俊傑之流了。俊傑如巢是這樣做法的，如果奸臣賊子都是俊傑，那我眞欲無言了。</p>
<p>先看，「識時務」這三個字的意義何在呢？投機取巧決不是識時務，出賣良心出賣民衆決不是識時務，叛國求榮決不是識時務，屈服於殘暴與黑暗勢力之下者決不是識時務，認識時代，認淸任務的人，才是識時務的人，才够得上稱爲「俊傑」。</p>
<p>一個人的是否識時務，一個人的是否爲俊傑，不是以個人所搜括到的利益爲標準的。能够認識時代，能够認淸目己的責任，爲最大多數人的利益而與黑暗勢力搏鬥的大，才是識時務的人，才是俊傑。</p>

<p>那正門口鋪著兩三塊舊木板，轉接到左手裏一個開著的門口裏去，掩護著木板下面的足印。霍桑忽站住在門口的一小方棕墊上面，蹲下身，將木板移過一邊。有兩行很顯明的男千皮鞋的泥印，和一行女子的高跟鞋印，便赫然可見。倪金壽也跟著霍桑僂下了身千細瞧。</p>
<p>「霍先生，這足印很淸楚。」</p>
<p>「眞淸楚一。霍桑跟著足印傴僂著一步步走向裏面的門口去，似乎正全神貫注，隨使應了一句。</p>
<p>「這西面深的一組是進入時留的，東面一組淡的是出去的。不過女鞋的印，祇有進入而沒有出去，分明就是死者的足印。」</p>
<p>「正是。這男鞋印一進一出，深淡的相差也不多。」</p>
<p>倪金壽又說道：「這進出兩組竟沒有錯亂交踐。」</p>
<p>霍桑忽旋轉身于，指著近正門處，搖頭道：「不，那邊小是有交踏的男鞋印子嗎？」</p>
<p>我回頭細瞧，果然在門口裏面有幾個男子足印是複疊的，不過一行很深，一行較淺，而且將近裏面門口越加淺淡，故而粗看便小覺得交疊，好像祇有一行。</p>
<p>倪金壽也說道：「是的，這交疊的兩行同樣是進入的印。奇怪！」（十一）</p>

<p>— 德馨</p>
<p>每天在英俪利物浦郵政管理局進進出出的信件，總數總在十萬件以上；而且各種郵遞的包裹等還未計算在內。所以該局的二千多職員，包括閱讀員，語言學家，密碼專家，化學家及各種專家，每天忙着理淸道一批堆積如山的郵件，再加以極精密的檢查：搜查間諜的密報，抽去有害國家的信件，和沒收一切足以資敵的貨品</p>
<p>在平時，這種郵件檢查工作，似乎還不多大要緊，但一到戰爭的時候，就關係重大了。每一個交戰國家，不僅英倫，都在竭力精細地進行這種工作。在各作戰前綫上，或各屯兵的地方，軍隊裏也有這種檢查員，專審查士兵們的家書；稍涉一些軍機的文字，都給刪去。旣送至各該目的地了，郵政分局對於這些外埠來的信件在未發送之前，澴須經專門人員完全仔細地檢閱過。如有不妥的字句，就用不透明墨水塗掉。不管信中所講的祇是些關於氣睽冷熱的問答之類，也要被塗去；因爲在飛機行動上，氣候是有着極大的影響的。如果信內還講到軍隊之調動的話，那更要被塗去了。</p>
<p>雖有隱秘得很的間諜的情報，也難逃檢查負尖僻銳敏的目光。一張有隱形墨水藏着密碼，但外觀極通常似毫無關係的字條，他們能用蒸汽噴射或其他化學方法把它檢出，冉由密碼專家翻譯出來。如果有雪茄紙烟等物輸寄經過，檢查員必用探針把它們一一試探過，看有無間諜們的夾帶在內。用外文書寫的信札則專歸語言學者譯出審查。有資送給敵人嫌疑的貨物，一概沒收。各種行李皮箱等都要經過細細的翻閱，甚至每件衣服的領口部要翻出看過；沒有一些可疑的形跡，方能得到輸送的准許。其精細嚴密可知。</p>
<p>上次大戰中，各國已吃過德國間諜不少的苦頭，大多還是失於郵政檢查上的不够嚴密。所以在這次大戰中，他們已受了一次敎訓，處處在竭力的防範着。郵政檢查就是他們當前一件最主要的業務了？</p>

<h3 id="c90">抗建中的中國戲劇 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>（重慶航訊）名劇作家馬彥祥，最近曾發表談話謂：「中國戲劇，在最近二年來的進步，可以超出昇平時候十年之上。」</p>
<p>的確，自抗戰以來，中國戲劇的發達，這是誰都不可抹殺的一件事實。據聞，在今日中國的內部，包括規模較大及流動性的劇團，其總數已在一千以上。其中七百團田中國政治訓練部分派在前綫各地演出，在山西那裏，亦有二百團。</p>
<p>關於各劇團的演員，大都是屬於一般年靑男女，有許多對於戲劇的生涯是從未體味過的，他們不過是受了愛國的熱忱所驅使而已。</p>
<p>今日中國的戲劇，隨着抗建的進行，已從頑老的氣氛中解放出來了，形式的拘束，禮節約束縛，在現在，是一一的被解除了。演員們在他們的演出中亦可以獲得較大的自由；一個如果到過中國內地的人，他必定能够有看這種感覺。</p>
<p>我們固然在戲院中，可以看到中國最進步的戲劇，但是，在街頭的角落間，難民的收容所內，茶館內，兵營內，那裏同樣的有中國最進沙的戲劇在演出呢！</p>
<p>由於中國戲劇的日趨大衆化，因此，所收到的各方面的宣傳效力，大出我們意料所能及。</p>
<p>但是為了日後能够更發展其力量起見，現在有二項問題是急於要解決的，第一即在技巧設備方面需改善；其次是演出的劇本內容方面需要大量的增添；尤其是後者，因為現在在搬演的劇本，義不多於結構上大部份是相同的，這樣，日子久後，難免發生失時效的弊病。</p>
<h3 id="c91">看了「海戀」 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 舜裔</p>
<p>「海戀」是一齣以南洋為背景的四幕悲劇。我看渦後和及朋談了許多的話，這裏所記的有下列幾點：</p>
<p>在第四幕裏，沙來（胡導、殺了他的妹妹美娜（小鳳）以後，導演（洪謨）給他安排了一陣在笑而下塲，這辦法是很好的，不過沙來的在笑該繼續到後臺上一個相當的時候，使得看劇的人還可以聽到，所謂「效果」纔發生，纔能够圓滿。</p>
<p>沙來殺了美娜這個「殺」是「殺死的」殺，至少是殺得頗重的「殺」。在排戲的時候，劇作者和導演都曾想到這一點，所以，計劃是由李興銘（嚴俊）把她抱起來送回後臺。或者就讓她躺在臺上—躺在一個角落，直到劇終。沮是前一個辦法，因為小鳳的身體頗不輕，抱起來不是件容易的事而打消，後辦法同樣地因小鳳這時的小鳳是一個被哥哥殺死了的馬來少女美娜，死了的美娜，怎樣躺在臺上纔會不影響臺上以後的許多的其他的動作而宣告「此　不通」，因此，在第一次上演的時候，關於這一個塲面的處理，導演給找們是：由被殺了的美娜自已慢慢爬起來再由李學銘等扶她向後臺走去。這個辦法也許是經過了幾許的考慮，不過我祇覺得這一個高潮所應得的效果由此而完全不能獲得，一個被殺死了的人，怎麽能要她自己站起來，跑了回去？當他抱起了她的時候，還可以有許多字句從李學銘口裏吐出，是「獨白」，也是向美娜伸訴！</p>
<p>我想寫的就祗這一些，算是我的視福，我的敬意，向小鳳，向吳天，向上海劇藝社諸君。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Allied Forces Strenuously Resist German Offensive: Unprecedented Battle Unfolds on Entire French Front; German Attempt to Forcibly Cross the Seine River Repelled; French Frontline in Soissons Area Retreats Ten Miles <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Paris – Military observers here recently stated that the battles on the forward lines this morning are still raging fiercely. The French army is firmly defending its positions, and its resistance is comparable to the Battle of Verdun during the previous European war. German tank units advanced from the town of Fère-Champenoise towards the bridge at Arches, attempting to forcibly cross the Seine River, but were repelled by the French army. In the Soissons area, the German army has made some progress today due to the arrival of fresh troops (including infantry and tank units) to assist in the battle, but at the cost of thunderous strength and significant losses, the gains are not worth the cost. Generally speaking, the German side has suffered extremely heavy losses along the entire front. Although their invasion of France has only lasted for a month, they have already exerted their full strength. On the French side, although they are fewer in number than the Germans, they are still able to consolidate their positions and inflict heavy blows on the enemy, which is commendable. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters recently issued a communiqué stating that the battles from the coast to the city of Argonne are still ongoing, and the situation is becoming increasingly fierce. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris – Authoritative military sources admit that the French army is currently facing a critical moment of life and death, indicating that the fierce battles on the Western Front are still underway. All the new types of weapons invented by the Germans have been transported to the front lines for use. Therefore, north of Paris, an unprecedented human war in history is currently taking place. According to the latest news, the French army has retreated ten miles south from the Soissons area to the vicinity of Pierrefonds and Villers-Cotterêts. (International News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Ministry of War announced today that the German army has reached Rouen along the Seine River. The city's position northwest of Paris is of utmost importance, and its fall would further threaten the safety of Paris, as Paris is now threatened from three sides. However, the German plan to cross the river has been completely shattered. (International News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters issued a battle report tonight stating that the enemy forces are continuing their attacks, and their frontal offensive has expanded to the Argonne area. (1) The pressure from the enemy forces in the La Bassée area has lessened, and their mechanized units have advanced to Fère-Champenoise and Arcis, advancing towards the cities of Rouen and Gisors, with a small number of troops reaching the outskirts of Rouen and the town of Pontoise. (2) Between Montdidier and Noyon, and between the Oise and Aisne rivers, the enemy forces have been frustrated and suffered heavy losses. The enemy forces launched an offensive in the area of Pontavert, and their offensive between Château-Porcien and Argonne has been effectively contained by our forces. Although the enemy forces have crossed the Aisne River in two places, our forces are counterattacking. Although our forces are fewer in number than the enemy and are very fatigued, they are still fighting bravely and without retreat. (3) Our air force continues to attack the enemy's mechanized units with considerable success. Although the enemy's aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery have attempted to obstruct them, they have been ineffective. Our units have also attacked and inflicted damage on several enemy units based on reconnaissance aircraft instructions, and have seized a large number of military supplies. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris – According to news received here, the situation on the front lines after noon today is roughly as follows: (1) In the Champagne area (upstream of the Aisne River), the enemy forces launched a fierce attack on our positions. Although the pressure from the enemy forces was extremely strong between noon and 2 p.m., the allied positions remained unshaken. (2) In the area south of Oumale and Montdidier, the enemy forces also launched a fierce attack. Our forces continued to retreat east of Roye and south of Montdidier. (3) The enemy forces attacked in the Soissons area, and our forces counterattacked. It is still unknown what the outcome will be. (4) The enemy air force launched a large-scale bombing of the transportation lines near Paris, especially the town of Pontoise. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>German Offensive Force Reaches One Hundred Divisions From Coast to Forest Area</p>
<p>Paris – Military sources here recently stated that the German side is currently fighting with all its strength. The entire front, stretching only 400 kilometers from the coast in the west to the forest area in the east, is being attacked by no less than one hundred German divisions. All kinds of weapons are being used, and the scale is unprecedented in history. The total number of soldiers on both sides is over four million. The fighting began at dawn today, with the German army launching simultaneous attacks on land and in the air. In addition to resisting, the allied forces occasionally launched large-scale counterattacks. Modern warfare and traditional warfare are mixed together. Both sides are using no fewer than several thousand 75mm field guns, and each is sending large groups of aircraft in multiple waves to attack the other's rear units and tank convoys. At this time, in late spring and early summer, the French countryside is sunny and the scenery is beautiful, but unspeakable and terrifying war is unfolding dramatically in this kind of scenery. In addition, modern warfare is a total war, resulting in the destruction of peaceful villages in flames. Many fires have also occurred in the German rear due to bombing by allied aircraft groups. Another difference between this war and the previous European war is that neither side is digging trenches, and defensive positions are scattered everywhere and are disguised. Both sides' troops are often mobilized in the dim twilight to avoid bombing, and engineers also begin to work at this time. German engineers erect pontoon bridges every dusk and night, but because the starlight is bright every night, this kind of work by the Germans is seen by allied reconnaissance aircraft, which immediately drop bombs to destroy them. When the German tank convoys are dispatched at dawn, the huge behemoths advance in formation, and the allied forces immediately open fire. However, the 25mm flat-trajectory guns are no longer effective, while the 75mm field guns are very effective. Therefore, the allied forces have changed to using 75mm cannons everywhere on the front lines. In short, in this modern battle, the number of combat troops on both sides is over four million, and the weapons used include thousands of aircraft, countless machine guns, thousands of cannons, and thousands of tanks. Every farmhouse has become a small fortress, and every forest is like a large trap. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>German Army Used Paratroopers in Champagne Area</p>
<p>Paris – Military experts here recently stated that the German military authorities originally wanted to achieve a decisive victory today, but in reality, this was not the case. The German side, with a force of two million men, attacked fiercely for 48 hours, but not only failed to break through the French army's lines, but was also repelled or contained by the French army in many places. For example, in the Champagne area, the German army had a total of forty divisions, and their repeated attacks were repelled. In the Argonne area, from the city of Château-Porcien (west of the city of Rethel) to the line of Chêne-Populeux, although they occupied two bridgeheads on the left bank of the Aisne River, they were in a very dangerous situation due to constant French counterattacks. The German army also used a large number of paratroopers for the first time in the Champagne area, but because they were in the open countryside, they could not do anything. According to the French General Headquarters, after the German paratroopers landed, they were heavily surrounded by the French army north of the town of Vouziers and could be wiped out. The German army also launched an attack in the Pontavert area this evening, expanding the war zone to the east, but the situation on the 35-kilometer front in the middle reaches of the Aisne River, between the cities of Pontavert and Château-Porcien, remained unchanged. The German tank convoys launched a fierce attack in the lower reaches of the Seine River and achieved some success, reaching the outskirts of the cities of Rouen, Pontoise and Gisors. However, they penetrated deep into enemy territory and lost contact with the main infantry forces. These units are currently in the towns of Fère-Champenoise and Arcis, attempting to seize an important bridgehead, but have failed to do so. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>War Zone Extends to Swiss Border: Intense Artillery Battles at Southern End of Western Front</p>
<p>Paris – General Weygand, the Allied Supreme Commander, mentioned in his order yesterday that the development of the war may extend to the Swiss border, which has drawn general attention to the Rhine front. Regarding this point, Paris did not receive any special news last night to confirm it, but a few days ago, German artillery units launched fierce bombardments at several locations along the Swiss border, which may be related to this. According to the Swiss newspaper Basler Nachrichten, artillery units on both sides of the Rhine River are active again, with artillery fire focused on the front lines and railways. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Basel – At 3:00 a.m. today, a fierce artillery battle broke out on the German-French border near Basel, Switzerland. The initial phase lasted for fifteen minutes. After a 45-minute pause, it started again. Residents of Basel were awakened by the sound of artillery and went to the rooftops to watch the explosions of artillery shells falling in Germany and France. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland – French artillery units fired shells at the German positions at the end of the front line near the Swiss border last night, making it the most intense shelling in the current war. Thick smoke was seen billowing from German territory. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">German War Report <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Berlin – A communiqué from the German High Command stated that although the resistance of the Allied forces on the line from the Oise River to the Somme River was fierce, German tanks had led infantry to break through it. The German army has also crossed the Aisne River in two directions in the Soissons area, reaching a location northeast of the French capital, less than 36 kilometers from the French capital. The communiqué also stated that "The German army is pursuing the enemy everywhere, and the enemy's resistance to the German army has failed in all cases." (International News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters – The German war report this afternoon stated that the German army's progress towards the lower reaches of the Seine River, the Marne River, and Champagne was quite smooth, as planned. The German army has won a great victory, but even greater victories are yet to come. All enemy counterattacks have failed. The German air force is very active, bombing the enemy's headquarters in Reims, as well as bombing troop concentration areas, artillery positions, and other military targets. The ports of Cherbourg and Le Havre have been bombed, and many ships have been hit, some of which have been severely damaged. A troop transport ship (5,000 tons) was hit and caught fire, and a merchant ship (8,000 tons) north of Halstad was hit and exploded. Yesterday, a total of 91 enemy aircraft were lost, 68 of which were shot down directly in aerial combat, 14 of which were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the rest were destroyed on the ground. Only five German aircraft are missing. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Senior German military sources here claimed last night that the Allied forces in France had been forced out of their defensive positions and would resist the advancing German army in an undefended open area. German officers said that the German army had crossed the Somme and Aisne rivers and broken through the extensive positions of the "Weygand Line" and other places. If the Allied forces were forced to withdraw from their trenches and outposts, they should either retreat to Paris or fight a battle in the open ground between the Somme River and the lower reaches of the Seine River. The German army believes that this area is extremely favorable. German military leaders claim that the German line in France currently resembles a crescent shape, gradually encircling the Allied forces, with additional German troops penetrating the Allied positions along the entire front, threatening to disperse and destroy them, as in the Battle of Flanders. Military authorities pointed out that the greatest pressure from the German army is being applied to the Allies on the German right wing south of the Somme River. In this area, most of the German air force is assisting large tank units, supported by thousands of infantry troops. The High Command announced last night that the German army had crossed the Aisne River on both sides of Soissons, 42 miles from Paris, and had "crushed" France's attempt to contain the German army. Intelligence from the High Command stated that German blitzkrieg forces had penetrated the Allied defense lines deeply at various points, forcing the French army to retreat completely. The German right wing is reportedly advancing towards the Seine River west of Paris, threatening Rouen and Le Havre. At the same time, the German High Command announced that the German army had launched another offensive on a new front, the position of which was not announced, but it is believed to be along the 120-mile line east of the Aisne River, which was previously quiet. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to an essay published by Dr. Clegg, a political reporter for the "Monday Report," entitled "Overwhelming Victory," General Weygand deployed a defense line in the Somme and Aisne area, while the German army penetrated deep into the French rear, causing the French army to be caught in a pincer movement. German armored vehicles and mechanized units, covered by aircraft, concentrated on breaking into enemy territory at several points, allowing the war to develop according to German plans, rather than according to the French defense plans.

<p>Paris – Dozens of French fighter jets flew over Paris today, launching a large-scale attack on German bombers attempting to bomb the city of Paris. At 7:00 a.m. this morning, when a huge swarm of German aircraft surged in, French anti-aircraft guns densely fired at the German aircraft, and French fighter jets also went to meet them in battle. Due to the fierce attacks by French fighter jets, only a few bombs fell in the city of Paris, but the outskirts of Paris were heavily bombed by German aircraft. There is still no official estimate of the number of dead and wounded. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Battle Situation in Jingxiang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army's forceful crossing of the Han River and advance north towards Xiangfan, with a southern gaze towards Jingyi, is a new development made by the Japanese army in the recent few days after repeated defeats. Examining its motives, rather than saying it has any value in terms of aggressive military matters, it is better to say that it stems purely from political significance. In other words, it is attempting to echo its political goals with a posture of military offensive. Therefore, from the overall situation, this Japanese advance into Xiangfan and Jingyi is still a continuation of the political offensive, rather than the beginning of a new military offensive. Since occupying Wuhan, the Japanese strategy in the Northwest has been to covet Tongguan and Luoyang, and to spy on Shaanxi and Gansu; its strategy in Central China has been to seize Xiangfan and Jingyi, and to advance on Sichuan and Shu. Not only has China adopted effective counter-measures strategically, but also has displayed active counterattacks in operations; therefore, it defends Shanxi on one side to control Hebei, and holds onto Xiangfan and Jingyi on the other to shield Sichuan and Shu; for the past year and a half, it has made the Japanese's ambitions achieve no progress. It is true that although military science advances with the times, the importance of geographical conditions, ancient and modern, only differs in degree, without any fundamental change. Hebei is a large plain, and is still the so-called place of four battles; if it only occupies Hebei and fails to control Shanxi, then history only has records of failure. Going far back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there are countless examples. In short, Shanxi is extremely important strategically in terms of geography. For three years, although the Japanese army has entered Shanxi, Shanxi is still under the control of the Chinese army, making the Japanese army in Shanxi one of several mud legs. Therefore, occupying Hebei and eastern Henan has still failed to follow the Longhai Railway and put pressure on Tongguan and Luoyang. Although it has repeatedly stirred eight times last year, it has all ended in failure. The Chinese army has always firmly defended Tongguan and Luoyang, occupying the high ground and responding to each other between Shanxi and Shaanxi. As for Xiangfan, to explain it in terms of military geography, it relies on Tongguan and Luoyang forming a heavenly net, and has Sichuan and Shu below it, similar to an earthly guide. Xiangfan breaks into the middle, just like the "bottom of a bag"; going deep into the bottom of the bag is bound to share the same fate as a turtle in a jar. Such a statement is by no means a curse, but the wonderful structure of nature, and the Chinese generals are able to use it vividly. Therefore, from a military point of view, this offensive by the Japanese army against Xiangfan, at most, earns a kind of praise, that is, possessing the courage to throw oneself into the net. Then why take this inferior course of action?</p>
<p>Someone has reviewed the Japanese army's progress at points and lines, and tallied its achievements. In the initial stage of the invasion, it seized Liaoning and Jilin in one fell swoop, and then seized Heilongjiang and Jehol in another, with excellent results. After the July 7th Incident, China launched a full-scale war of resistance, and the situation became very different. Shanghai, a small place, fought for three months; but at the same time, in North China, there was still considerable progress, which goes without saying. Afterwards, from the fall of Nanjing to the occupation of Wuhan, the average daily advance line was still one and a half miles long. Since the capture of Wuhan to the capture of Nanning, the average daily advance line is less than one-fifth of a mile. From then on, whether advancing or retreating, it is no longer possible to use miles as a unit of calculation. Assuming that it can still advance an average of one-fifth of a mile per day thereafter, according to their military budget, it must spend an average of five million yuan per day. This aggressive achievement and financial burden make the Japanese warlords have to demand peace, and have to urgently seek the realization of peace. But since they cannot thoroughly understand that only by giving up aggression and withdrawing troops can peace be obtained; they also cannot conceal their ambitions, but want to complete their aggression under the political offensive. The political offensive has also been fruitless for a long time, and knowing the strength of China's determination to resist the war, and the declining morale of the Japanese military and people, they have opened their minds and issued various naive attempts. Originally, in a national war, a political offensive is fundamentally a naive attempt, and now it is all the more naive to bet everything on it. One is to continue bombing Chongqing. According to their own explanation, they have already openly admitted that the bombing has nothing to do with military matters, and only hope to beg for bombs to eliminate China's determination to resist the war. The second is to imitate the blitzkrieg tactics, taking the successes that Germany has achieved in Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium, and trying them in the Chinese cities of Xiangyang, Fancheng, Jingzhou, and Yichang. Japan may hope that such bombing and such tactics will accidentally reap unexpected great effects; in a mad state of mind, they often take unimaginable illusions as possible realities. But the final facts will certainly give a keen lesson, and before they learn the lesson, in the process of this attempt, the Japanese side may as well hope that this bombing and this tactic can also stimulate the deflated political offensive and make it slightly excited, and that there will be some unexpected progress. In fact, the essence of a political offensive is only a tool of a military offensive. Now, wanting to switch the roles of guest and host, and doing the opposite, using the military offensive as an adornment for the political offensive, then its associated failure is an inevitable result, and a very quick ending.</p>

<p>London: After the Norwegian authorities decided to surrender to the Germans, British and French troops have withdrawn from northern Norway. It is reported that King Haakon of Norway and the government knew of the British and French withdrawal beforehand and understood it. After Haakon issued a ceasefire order, he is said to have come to England on a warship. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: King Haakon of Norway has arrived at a certain port in England on a British warship. Senior officials of the British Admiralty welcomed him there. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Capital of Sweden: King Haakon VII of Norway has issued a declaration from the island of Tromsø in that country, stating that Britain and France were forced to concentrate their forces on the Western Front, which resulted in the Norwegian army lacking resources in terms of technology, especially ammunition and aircraft, and unable to continue fighting. He was unable to participate in battles outside the country. In order to avoid greater devastation of the country, the King and the government decided to accept the advice of the General Headquarters and ordered a ceasefire. This matter will surely be supported by the Parliament and the Army and Navy. In addition, the government has been reorganized, recruiting representatives from various parties to form a cabinet of national unity. It is also reported that King Haakon VII has led Crown Prince Olav to England. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a special communiqué this afternoon, stating that German soldiers in Narvik, as an isolated force deep in enemy territory, resisted a numerically superior enemy for several weeks, finally forcing the Allied naval, land, and air forces to withdraw from the Narvik area.

<p>Stockholm, Capital of Sweden: Swedish political figures commented this morning that the surrender of the Norwegian army was mainly due to the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief realizing that a local victory in Narvik would not help the overall situation. The German victory on the Western Front has made the Scandinavian countries no longer trust in the Allies' final victory. It is widely believed that the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief must have been greatly disappointed with the Allies' ineffective assistance, so he decided to surrender and avoid unnecessary destruction of territory. Local political figures believe that after the Allied forces withdraw, the war should not spread to Sweden. The whereabouts of the Norwegian King and government officials are unknown. Some say that the King and his party have gone to England on a British ship, while others say that they have crossed into Finland. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>

<p>Rome: Mussolini stated that he has handed Italy's declaration of war to the British and French ambassadors to Italy. He also said that the most important task now is to fight against the reactionary forces and countries that have always hindered the development of the Italian people. He reiterated that Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia are not Italy's enemies, and Italy will not fight against them. (Haitong News Agency Urgent Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>New York: Italian troops invaded Riviera, southern France, at 6:20 PM tonight. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italy's relations with Britain and France are becoming increasingly tense today. According to Rome Radio, the British Navy has seized the Italian mail ship Vulcania, weighing 24,000 tons, and escorted it to Gibraltar. It is reported that before this action by the British Navy, the Italian Minister of Economic Warfare, Mr. Maggi, issued a statement saying that the Allied naval blockade of Italy was illegal and an infringement of Italian sovereignty. Less than 24 hours after this statement was issued, the British Navy took this action. Some people believe that the British Navy's seizure of the Vulcania shows that the Allies have abandoned their policy of appeasing Italy and will no longer compromise and relax restrictions on contraband goods. Informed sources believe that if Britain seizes other Italian mail ships again, the possibility of Italy joining the war this week will become more credible. It is also generally acknowledged that Mr. Ansado, a well-known reporter considered to be the spokesman for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also delivered a broadcast speech to the Italian army last night, warning that Italy will join Germany to attack Britain as soon as France is defeated by Germany. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Axis powers' strategy, held by some political observers here, that Italy would join the war if Paris fell, was confirmed last night by Ansado, editor of Ciano's news, during his weekly broadcast to the Italian army. Ansado indicated that Italy might first launch an attack in North Africa, saying that France may not be able to resist for a long time, and then Germany will implement the second part of its plan to attack Britain. At that time, Italy will fight hard so that Germany and Italy can jointly liberate Europe and free the world from British tyranny. Prime Minister Mussolini's appointment of General Bono to command the Southern Army is of great significance, and it has already been formed. Part of the army may become the vanguard in this new struggle. Foreign diplomats and journalists have been repeatedly surprised by Italy's postponement of joining the war, and do not know whether it is due to hesitation at the last moment or due to concerns about foreign policy. It is widely believed that Mussolini's temporary halt was due to Hitler's advice, because Hitler was deeply afraid that if the Balkan war broke out, the Soviet Union would have a reaction to it. It is rumored that the Soviet Union is now transferring troops stationed on the Romanian border to the Polish border, so it is said that it is greatly beneficial to Germany to maintain peace in the Mediterranean and southeastern Europe while Germany is focusing all its military power on France. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome: News today says that unless France peacefully resolves Italy's Mediterranean demands, Mussolini may announce his intervention in the European war tonight. It is reported that the Italian Prime Minister is preparing to give a speech at 6:00 PM tonight (Shanghai Daylight Saving Time is 3:00 AM on Tuesday). Some Italian newspapers predict that the Italian Prime Minister may present conditions to France, requesting that France grant Italy's demands in the Mediterranean, otherwise, it will join the war. Tonight, the Italian Ministry of the Army has ordered some areas to implement blackout measures. This afternoon, all shops were closed, and Italian national flags were hoisted on all buildings in Venice Square. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome: It is expected that Mussolini will deliver an important speech this afternoon.

<p>Berlin: The German Command today issued a special report claiming that five major British warships have been sunk by Germany. According to reliable estimates, their tonnage totals more than 60,000 tons. Authoritative sources claim that German warships operating in the North Sea, such as the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, have won victories. In a battle last Saturday, they sank the British aircraft carrier Glorious of 20,000 tons and a destroyer. In another battle, they sank a British battleship of 10,000 tons and a new British small destroyer. They also sank the British transport ship Orama and the British naval oil tanker Pioneer of 9,100 tons. (International News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>London: The British armed merchant cruiser Calgarian (2,277 tons) was recently sunk by a German submarine torpedo. More than one hundred crew members were rescued and arrived at a British port last night. The crew claimed that the Calgarian was hit by a torpedo, killing two senior and two junior officers. When the ship was disabled, the German submarine surfaced, but the ship opened fire, forcing the submarine to submerge. Thereafter, every time the submarine tried to surface, it was bombarded with artillery fire, so it hid underwater and was unable to fire at the damaged Calgarian again. Eight hours later, two warships arrived on the scene, and a barge successively sailed over to send the crew of the Calgarian to the warships. The Calgarian sank within thirty-two hours of being hit.

<p>London: The British Air Ministry announced last night that on Saturday and Sunday, Royal Air Force medium bombers continued to attack enemy lines of communication behind the front, such as road junctions and river crossings. Concentrations of enemy troops and armored vehicle columns were also bombed. Two of our aircraft went missing. At night, our aircraft continued to bomb. Roads northeast of Amiens and key points in the Abbeville area were attacked by our heavy bombers. Ammunition stored in the forest area of Ardennes was also hit and exploded. Other heavy bomber squadrons attacked military targets in a vast area from Ardennes to Rheydt, Prussia, and the Ruhr at night. Aircraft from the Coastal Command flew to Ghent and bombed and strafed the oil storage tanks there. The oil tanks were severely damaged, and a major fire broke out. All of our aircraft have returned. Yesterday, our fighters shot down ten enemy aircraft, including seven bombers. Two of our aircraft went missing. Eight Royal Air Force Hurricane fighters were patrolling the airspace over the French theater yesterday when they encountered twenty German Heinkel 111 bombers. They shot down six of them. Ten Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters were attacked by Hurricane British aircraft and were unable to effectively protect the enemy bombers. One of them was shot down. Two Hurricane British aircraft went missing. Another Air Ministry communiqué described the British aircraft bombing the Ghent oil storage tanks, stating that when the second batch of British bombers flew to Ghent, part of the oil tanks was already on fire. They then dropped bombs on other oil tanks surrounded by flames. The British aircraft that arrived later saw that their target was already on fire, so they aimed and dropped bombs, further expanding the burning area. All British aircraft bombings were successful. The fire spread widely, and the flames soared into the sky. The aircrew of the last British aircraft to arrive believed that bombing was a waste of bombs, but they saw five railway lines in the firelight, two of which were full of freight cars. They then dropped bombs on the freight cars. After the freight cars were hit, there were successive violent explosions. Subsequently, other oil tanks were also hit by bombs. Thick smoke billowed up. Some were hit by machine gun bullets, and oil flowed everywhere. They were then hit by British aircraft incendiary bombs, causing the fire to spread even more fiercely. From dusk until dawn, British Air Force heavy bombers constantly attacked military targets in Germany and the northern French theater. Enemy reinforcements advancing on the Somme front were harassed by bombing and machine gun fire. Ammunition stored in many areas behind enemy lines was destroyed, and transportation lines were also cut off by low-flying British aircraft. Other British squadrons penetrated deep into the German defense lines and attacked key railway junctions and parking areas between Rheydt, Prussia, and the Belgian border. Freight trains were hit and caught fire, and tunnels were blocked, disrupting railway traffic. Abbeville on the Somme front was heavily attacked by our heavy bombers after dusk. One of the main railway bridges was hit by two bombs, and one end of the bridge was completely destroyed. Two hours later, British aircraft attacked the city twice, dropping high-explosive bombs, which apparently hit an ammunition depot. A terrible explosion followed, and even aircraft in the air were severely shaken. British aircraft also attacked a town eight miles west of Abbeville, dropping bombs that hit the railway and the bridge across the mouth of the Somme River. The anti-aircraft gun crews protecting the bridge were destroyed. They then dropped flares and saw that the northern end of the bridge had completely collapsed. In addition, enemy supply columns and forests harboring enemy troops were repeatedly bombed by our aircraft. Intersections on the roads and highways from Amiens to the south and north were also bombed. Tracks and storage sheds were severely damaged. The Valenciennes oil depot was bombed by aircraft, causing an explosion and fire. The flames reached a height of 500 feet and could be seen 50 miles away. Black smoke rose 7,000 feet, covering the area for several minutes before dispersing. In a forest near Abbeville, an oil depot was bombed by our low-flying aircraft, which dropped one hundred incendiary bombs, causing a violent explosion. The forest caught fire, and the fire was as bright as day. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

The King also said that he firmly believes that in this critical time, the church will strive to inspire the people's quiet courage. The Archbishop of Canterbury gave a speech welcoming the British King, saying, "We pray that our King and Queen will soon be protected by God, celebrate victory, the salvation of the world, and the attainment of a just and lasting peace.

<p>Yichang: The Japanese army on the front line of Hanyi launched a full-scale disturbance on the morning of the 9th and was met with fierce shooting by the Chinese army. In one day, more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, while the Chinese army suffered minimal damage. The Japanese offensive has shown signs of decline.</p>
<p>At night, the Chinese army launched a large-scale night attack with strong units, and the entire Japanese line fell into extreme chaos. Under the dim moonlight, the Japanese army fled in panic, and was cut down by the Chinese army in all directions, with corpses covering the field. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese air force resumed its attacks to assist in the battle, constantly bombing blindly. However, the first-line Japanese army had completely collapsed and had no time to reorganize their forces. Therefore, there was no fierce fighting on the entire front line today, and a stalemate was formed. The large Chinese army, hidden in the lake swamp area east of Jingzhou and Shashi, reorganized its forces on the morning of the 9th and launched a large-scale counterattack against the Japanese army that had advanced near Jingzhou and Shashi. A large number of Japanese reinforcements were discovered at Zhiqi Bridge, Daluo Chang, and Guanzui Kou (all east of Shashi), rushing westward. That night, the Chinese army used part of its force to block the mouth of the pass, and the majority turned to the rear of the Japanese and began to attack. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. North of Dangyang, the Chinese army was particularly successful in intercepting the Japanese army heading south. The main force of the Japanese Northern Corps had been completely driven into the mountainous area between Dangyang and Yuan'an. On the morning of the 9th, the Chinese army further exerted strong pressure on the Japanese army from all directions. The Japanese army was difficult to stand in the steep mountains and had to retreat to the narrow Gorges River valley area near Yuan'an. The Chinese had pre-established a strong encirclement line and are now concentrating on annihilation. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: The fighting on the Hanyi Road front has been intense in the Shili Pu area in recent days. Part of the Japanese army reached Herong on the morning of the 8th and attempted to cross the Zhang River but was blocked by the Chinese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. In the area east of Ban Yue Mountain, the Japanese army and a Chinese unit engaged in fierce fighting from the night of the 7th until the night of the 8th. A strong Chinese unit joined the battle, and the Japanese army was annihilated by the Chinese, with more than a thousand killed. North of Jingmen, the Japanese repeatedly attacked Yaque Bridge but were repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. More than 10,000 Japanese troops once invaded the Hengdian area west of Dangyang and were severely attacked by a Chinese unit that had been ambushed there. They have now been completely blocked by the Chinese army in a corner near Hengdian, and the Chinese are intensifying their attacks, hoping to drive them into the Yuan'an area of the Gorges River valley and annihilate them. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Huixian Bridge area. On the front lines in central and western Hubei, the Japanese army used dozens of aircraft to assist in the battle all day, but the brave Chinese soldiers, with strong morale, fought even more bravely. The Japanese army has suffered serious blows. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: The Japanese army, which had been repeatedly defeated by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Nanzhang, Wu'an Yan, and the Gejia River south of Liujiaji, was the main force of the Japanese Northern Corps. It had been retreating southward for days, and had suffered particularly heavy casualties due to interceptions and flanking attacks by the Chinese army. The Japanese then turned westward. On the morning of the 9th, a Japanese force of about 2,000 troops reached the vicinity of Jinxiangping (west of Xianju). The Chinese army attacked from both sides, killing more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated into the surrounding mountains and forests. Another Japanese force, starting on the 8th, entered the steep mountains from the Guanyin Temple area of Lixi (both northeast of Dangyang) and rushed to the Yuan'an valley. This was exactly as the Chinese side had expected, and they were driven into the bottom of the trap. The Chinese had completely blocked the narrow passages in all directions with troops and are now encircling and annihilating them in that area. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese army in western Hubei has gradually increased to more than 60,000 troops. The fighting in the Dangyang area, both north and south, intensified on the 9th. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties under the strong fire network of the Chinese army. In the corner of Ban Yue Mountain alone, the Japanese had once approached and launched a fierce attack, but they were completely annihilated in front of the Chinese army's position by the densely deployed crossfire. This morning, the Japanese army's momentum was exhausted, and the infantry dared not approach. The artillery fire was also very sparse, relying entirely on the air force to carry out atrocities to support the battle situation. In the afternoon, the Chinese army launched another fierce attack, and the fire fight became intense again. The fierce fighting continued until late at night. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yidu: In the Jingmen and Dangyang areas, the Chinese army successfully launched a night attack last night, and the entire Japanese line was in disarray. On the morning of the 10th, the Chinese army continued its attacks, and the Japanese army was extremely shaken. The plan to implement a large-scale encirclement of the Japanese army has been finalized, and all are exerting their divine power, rushing towards the target of attack and annihilating all Japanese troops.

<p>Luoyang: The Shanxi Southern Chinese Army has continued to attack the Japanese army along the Jin Gao Highway for days, achieving great success. On the night of the 5th, they used clever tactics to annihilate more than 300 Japanese soldiers near Huoxiu Hang (east of Jincheng). On the 7th and 8th, the Japanese army at Tianjin Pass, Jincheng, Ershili Pu, and Zhoucun launched counterattacks against the Chinese in several ways, and used fierce artillery fire to assist in the battle. The Chinese army is strong and occupies an absolute advantage, and is now using great power to intercept the Japanese army that is breaking through. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese army trapped in Zhoucun Town south of Jincheng repeatedly tried to break through on the 5th, but were all severely attacked by the Chinese army and retreated back to the original town. At that time, many Japanese aircraft came to assist in the battle, but one was shot down by the Chinese army, and both the aircraft and the people were destroyed. On the morning of the 6th, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Gaoping arrived with reinforcements to Tianjin Pass by car, and then launched a fierce attack on Li Chuan. The Chinese army intercepted and attacked in separate ways, and a large number of Japanese soldiers were killed. The fierce fighting continued until late at night. On the same day, the Japanese army in Jincheng sent about a thousand reinforcements to Zhoucun Town, attempting to relieve the siege, but were again subjected to bloody and fierce fighting by the Chinese army. In total, more than 1,400 Japanese soldiers were killed in the past two days, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. (10th dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinhua: On the evening of the 5th, a Chinese unit destroyed the highway between Wu and Wukang, destroying hundreds of meters of road surface at Chengshan (north of Wukang). At the same time, another unit destroyed more than one hundred meters of roadbed at Baishan Bridge near Xiajia Dai (also north of Wukang). After destroying the road, the Chinese army ambushed near the highway. As expected, on the morning of the 6th, more than twenty Japanese cars carrying Japanese soldiers came to repair the road at Chengshan. They were ambushed by the Chinese, who destroyed several of their cars and killed more than one hundred Japanese soldiers. At Xiajia Dai, the Japanese army arrived by waterway in twenty motorboats and were also ambushed. The Chinese sank three Japanese boats and caused heavy Japanese casualties. On the morning of the 7th, the Japanese sent more than a thousand reinforcements from Wukang and concentrated artillery fire to launch a fierce attack on Yangshan, but were repelled by the Chinese. In the afternoon, the Japanese again mobilized more than a thousand reinforcements, seventy armored vehicles and cars, and more than ten artillery pieces from Deqing and Wukang, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese again in the Sanqiao Bu area north of Wukang.

<p>Chongqing. One hundred and twenty-nine Japanese planes in batches harassed the west, entering Sichuan's airspace around 1 PM on the 10th, directly attacking the capital. A large contingent of the Chinese air force had already taken to the skies and deployed. Each pilot, seeing the Japanese planes gradually entering the trap, was eager to attack. Part of the Japanese planes, seeing the situation was critical, hurriedly turned back. The Chinese air force heavily surrounded another part of the Japanese planes. The Japanese planes initially planned to fly high and escape, but were met with intense fire from the Chinese high-altitude units. They then broke out of the encirclement in all directions. The Chinese pilots chased to the airspace above Changshou and concentrated their fire on the Japanese planes. Two Japanese heavy bombers were hit, caught fire, and fell like dry leaves. The Japanese planes were extremely panicked. They were surrounded by the Chinese again over Fuling. Two Japanese heavy bombers exploded and crashed, falling in the western suburbs of Fuling. The remaining Japanese planes fled in panic. One part of the Chinese pilots continued to bravely pursue and brought another Japanese plane under control. It then fell to pieces amidst a rain of machine gun fire, scattering in all directions. Except for one Chinese warplane that suffered slight damage, all others returned safely to base.

<p>Hankou. The Japanese naval spokesman stated while hosting news reporters that, in order to achieve peace as soon as possible, the Japanese side is using its air force with all its strength to shatter the Chinese side's spirit of resistance. Therefore, current air force activities cannot be limited to military targets alone. In the future, all government offices will be listed as targets of attack. The reason why Japanese planes concentrate their attacks on Chongqing is because it is the seat of government. If the government moves to Chengdu, or Kunming, or other places in the future, Japanese planes will track them down and attack them. However, Japanese planes will do their best to avoid bombing the property of third countries. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington. Florida Democratic Senator Pope and Utah Democratic Senator William King declared today that if Japan wants the United States to sign a new commercial treaty with it, it should first restore China's territorial and political integrity. The two men said that they are willing to find a way to conclude a new version of the US-Japan commercial treaty, which expired last January without being renegotiated, but Japan must state its new Far Eastern policy regarding China and restore China's territorial and political integrity. The motive for advocating the renegotiation of the US-Japan commercial treaty was initiated yesterday by a Republican Senator from Michigan, Vandenberg. Senator Pope, who is also one of the advocates of aiding Britain and France, said that he also agrees with US-Japan friendship, but US-Japan friendship must be conditional on Japan acknowledging its mistakes in what it has done in China. First, Japan must stop its unprovoked war of aggression against the Chinese government and the Chinese people; second, Japan must withdraw its troops from China; and third, Japan must compensate China for its losses. Pope also said that regarding Manchuria and other places, if Japan needs these lands, then it should buy them at a reasonable price. William King's views are generally the same as Pope's. He firmly opposes recognizing the status quo in the Far East. King said, "I am in favor of any reasonable and honorable resolution of the US-Japan dispute in the Far East, but I am opposed to any solution that recognizes Japan's plunder of China, unless Japan is willing to acknowledge China's territorial integrity and abandon its tragic plunder at the expense of the Chinese people, I cannot tolerate Japan's current violation of treaties and principles."

<p>Washington. More than 50 prominent figures from the US political, naval, journalistic, and other circles jointly issued a statement last night, advocating that the United States immediately declare war on Germany, and that if the United States remains neutral, it cannot provide the Allied forces with its army, navy, and air force as quickly and as much as possible. At the same time, in New York, Walter, the acting chairman of the Allied Aid (Allied Forces) Protect America (United States) Committee, also advocated that the United States should make a formal declaration of its intention to provide material, economic, and moral assistance to the Allied countries. Former US Secretary of State Stimson, in a letter to the New York Herald Tribune, strongly argued that the United States should supply Britain and France with its military equipment and food without restriction, and advocated that the United States should implement military training nationwide. General Harbord, the Chief of Staff of the American Expeditionary Forces in the previous World War, said that he strongly agreed with the United States helping the Allied countries with an unlimited amount of aircraft and military equipment. Walter also said that the aid plan should be swift and practical. He finally issued a warning that, if it is delayed by over sixty days, the free destiny of mankind in the world may need centuries to come again. A delegation from the Allied Aid Protect America Committee will petition the White House, urging it to do its best to assist the Allied countries, and 22,000 people have already signed the petition.

<p>Washington. Hundreds of celebrities from the US business, literary, and scientific circles issued a joint declaration today, urging the government to directly declare war on national socialist Germany. They said, "Germans listen, our country is on the same side as Britain and France, which can be seen from the national defense plan formulated by our government. From the perspective of the Americans, national socialist Germany is a deadly enemy of all our ideals, systems, and lives. All that we have, our current position, and the position we hope to obtain, can be protected by the French 'Weygand Line'. Therefore, we should immediately use our surplus military equipment of the army, navy, and air force to defend our common defense line, which is the defense line of Britain and France. However, relying solely on this assistance is not enough to contain Germany's advance and prevent it from attacking American interests. The best way to do this now is to formally recognize the current situation and declare that a state of war has already entered between the United States and Germany, which would be the right thing to do."

In short, it is unwise for the United States to send its military equipment to the Allied countries. (10th Haitong dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo. The authorities here yesterday issued new strict regulations restricting the amount of water used by residents in order to cope with the drought. The authorities also warned Tokyo residents to prevent fires and epidemics. The current drought cannot be remedied without very heavy rain. Most of Tokyo's reservoirs are almost dry. The new regulations stipulate that, except for the hours of 4:00 AM to 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the water supply will be completely stopped in Tokyo. Yesterday, the Tokyo city government requested six million residents to conserve water in various ways, including drastically reducing the number of baths. The authorities also asked all foreigners and Japanese residents in Tokyo to conserve water for cooking and washing. Some residents in Tokyo are using trucks to transport water. The drastic reduction in water storage in reservoirs and incomplete pumping equipment make the need for water transportation by trucks very great. Officials here fear that if a fire breaks out, firefighters will have difficulty working due to lack of water and water pressure. Furthermore, the lack of water in ditches and residents drinking unsanitary water due to thirst will increase the risk of epidemics in and around Tokyo. Tokyo has stopped using water to sweep the streets. The lack of water has caused new difficulties for businesses and industries in the Tokyo area, especially industries that rely on steam-powered machinery. Although new water usage regulations have been issued, people are still exceeding their water limits. If it does not rain immediately, the water shortage will become even more severe. Rice in the Tokyo area has been severely damaged by the prolonged drought, resulting in the greatest loss in Japan's history. Water shortages in other places are not as severe as in Tokyo, but there is a lack of adequate water transport equipment, so it is impossible to transport water from other places to Tokyo.

<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Up until the time I am writing this section, everyone still believes that Italy will not participate in the war until at least the spring of 1940. Now, turning back to briefly explain what I have roughly stated above, regarding Italy's position in this war between Germany and England/France, and its relations with England, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>First, let's consider the attitude.</p>
<p>We observe that the general attitude of the British towards Italy is quite different from their attitude towards Germany, yet it is an interesting contrast.  Towards Germany, the attitude of the general British public is about 80% hostile.  The remaining 19.9% are advocating—or perhaps fantasizing—that Germany "could" become a friend of England, but with a prerequisite: to expand towards Eastern Europe and attack the Soviet Union.  If this condition is not met, then these gentlemen and ladies know that a conflict between England and Germany is almost impossible to avoid.  Therefore, in a flash, they first become silent, and then in another instant become enemies of Germany.  The most appropriate example here is the closure of the so-called "Cliveden Set" in March of this year, which was known as the major pro-German group in England "and even internationally."  And the mainstays of that group, such as the current Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, the current British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian, and the editor of The Times, Dawson, also changed and became leading anti-German figures.  Thus, today, the general British attitude is that 99.9% are anti-German.  The remaining 0.1% are blindly pro-German figures, who are a very small group of people under the leadership of the British Fascist party's so-called "British Union."  Its leader, Sir Mosley, still insists today that England and Germany are "friends related by life and death"!  Then, aren't England and Germany clearly on opposite sides today, fighting each other to the death as adversaries?  To this, Sir Mosley's explanation is: "That is the result of an international Jewish conspiracy!"  The British attitude towards Italy, although Germany and Italy are allies, is completely different from their attitude towards Germany.  The old grudges between England and Italy during the war between Italy and Abyssinia have now completely faded from the minds of the general British public.  Now, if we roughly calculate, about 80% are advocating for pro-Italian sentiment.  The remaining 20% are usually indifferent, but they often suddenly reveal anti-Italian opinions.  At such times, he or she is likely thinking of one, two, or all three of the following things: (1) Italy is Germany's ally, (2) Italy is the sworn enemy of England's ally France, and (3) the current rivalry between England and Italy in the Mediterranean and the Near East, and the absolutely irreconcilable contradictions that will eventually erupt in the future.  The peak of pro-Italian advocacy in England in the past two years was in the spring of last year (1938), around the time of Foreign Secretary Eden's resignation.  This peak continued until the eve of Chamberlain's visit to Rome in January of this year (1939).  The legal government of Spain and its independence were sacrificed during this peak!  However, shortly after Chamberlain returned, the pro-Italian attitude in England showed a trend of receding, but basically, of course, it did not change.  After the war between Germany and England/France began this time, the general pro-Italian attitude in England rose again.  The reason for the rise, needless to say, is the desire to break Italy away from the "German-Italian Axis."  The most obvious expression of this is the recent speeches by the current British First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill.  However, there is a phenomenon worth pointing out here, that is, although the high tide of pro-Italian sentiment has risen again, the very frequent diplomatic contacts between England and Italy that existed throughout 1938 have not been restored.  In other words, before and after the outbreak of this great war, England did not engage in formal work to break up the German-Italian Axis with Italy.  Why?  First of all, naturally, it is because England is concentrating all its efforts on mobilizing and arranging for the war against Germany and has no time for external diplomacy.  Secondly, the reason, when counted, is due to England’s strong attitude on this point.  Probably about half a year ago, the then-Italian Ambassador to England, Grandi, once stood up at a reception at the embassy in London for British personnel from Germany and Italy and said something to this effect: "I am speaking here, standing in the enemy's headquarters of our mortal enemy!"  Shortly after, this ambassador was criticized by all levels of British society and consequently lost his job.  However, then the current Secretary-General of the Italian Fascist Party, A. Starace, openly made the witty remark: "Let us not be fooled into thinking that London and Paris will really make concessions to the Axis countries. Germany and Italy must recognize that only by force can they compel the implementation of their methods."  This gave a great blow to a faction in England that hoped for a peaceful resolution of the disputes between England and Italy and between France and Italy at the time.  These two incidents are just typical examples picked at random.  Of course, we must know that all of this is by no means a coincidence.  They are illustrating that Italy under the rule of the Fascist Party is holding an extremely contemptuous and arrogant attitude towards England and France, and the degree of expression is even greater than that of the people of the German Nazi Party!  For more than a year, everyone knows that as long as the current German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop gains power, the relations between England and Germany will only deteriorate day by day.  Similarly, there is no possibility of adjustment with the current Italian Foreign Minister Ciano.  These two are competitors who despise and antagonize England and France.  Moreover, according to the German and Italian saying, the rising young countries will inevitably gradually eliminate the old and decaying countries.  The so-called "young" specifically refers to Germany and Italy; the so-called old and decaying specifically refers to England and France.  The birthplace of this statement is in Italy.  Based on this idea, according to the opinion of the Italian Fascist Party members, Italy has absolutely no possibility or necessity to adjust or be friendly with England and France.  If we take a step back and say that they can live in peace with each other and not interfere with each other, then Italy has one condition: "Satisfy Italy's natural desires."  What is the specific content of this so-called "desire"?  "Tunisia, Corsica, Djibouti!"  And "Turn the Mediterranean into Italy's inland sea!"</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of exploring this attitude, England and Italy are currently diverging in opposite directions. Having understood this, then the current strange phenomenon that pro-Italian sentiment is again rampant in England but no special external steps have been taken can be mostly explained.</p>
<p>However, in order to further understand, we might as well take a deeper look.</p>
<p>If England and Italy begin negotiations to adjust their relations now, then is there a possibility of success? Now, based on the conditions between each other, as far as we know, we can probably assert that there is absolutely no possibility of its success. Everyone knows that during the Spanish Civil War, Italy once expressed to England that the major premise for the adjustment of relations between England and Italy was Franco's victory. Because they believed this, the British Chamberlain government did not hesitate to violate the opinion of France and cruelly sacrificed the Spanish government forces. But now, Italy has another new major premise, which is: "Tunisia, Corsica, Djibouti!" These are all French territories. Regarding this, France has repeatedly stated that she would rather fight than make concessions. Then, assuming that England disregards everything and adjusts relations between England and Italy, the possible paths in front of her seem to be only two: either tacitly agree with Italy and not intervene in the dispute between Italy and France, or openly exert diplomatic pressure on France to make her yield. If it is the former, then it is equivalent to England withdrawing from the Anglo-French alliance: needless to say, this is absolutely difficult to do at present! If it is the latter, that is to say, England cruelly sells out France again; this, when the "Chamberlain cabinet line" is completely victorious, might still be possible, but now that England and Germany have started a war, and the Soviet Union and Germany are holding hands, and England is also under the situation of the current "wartime cabinet," it is also absolutely impossible. Therefore, on the English side, she really has no way to satisfy Italy's prerequisite. Looking at it from the Italian side again. If she wants to be thoroughly friendly with England, then England's only most important condition is her withdrawal from the German-Italian alliance. Simply this strategic "neutrality" at present is probably not much different from participating in the war outright in terms of harm to England and France. However, if we study the key points of Italy's foreign policy, we can immediately know that its most fundamental point at present is cooperation with Germany! Losing Germany's support in the morning, by the evening, Italy would probably become a second-rate country in the eyes of England and France, this is one; in case Germany suffers a defeat because of losing Italian aid, then the center of gravity of Italian imperialism's continental and overseas external expansion will immediately disappear, this is two; and there is the most important third point: the external expansion of German and Italian imperialism, in addition to being objectively promoted by the material conditions shared by all imperialist powers, also adds the arrogant ambitions of the dictators and their followers. The formation of the British and French empires and the current situation are completely different. In addition to striving to complete the two empires, they also strive to complete the individual dictators! The ultimate goal of Mussolini and Hitler's cooperation lies in dividing the world equally. The present is only one of the processes. If they look to the distant future, then there will be many more places where they need to collude! Therefore, on the Italian side, it is also impossible for it to satisfy England's biggest condition—withdrawing from the German-Italian alliance.</p>
<p>Here, I want to explain something incidentally. Recently, the public opinion and propaganda organs of England and France have been spreading and predicting the division between Germany and Italy. Indeed, if Germany and Italy split up because of their own conflicting interests, then that should be the most ideal thing for England and France. However, many of these divisive factors are not suddenly appearing today, but have been around for a long time. Since they have not caused Germany and Italy to split up, of course they will not today either. As for the newly added factors, if we carefully review them, we cannot find anything serious enough to cause them to split up. Moreover, if we just refresh our memory, then we can immediately discover that on our memory, starting from the day the German-Italian Axis was formed until today, almost every day has been filled with this kind of statement. Therefore, various divisive factors exist between Germany and Italy, but they are not related to the current relationship between Italy and England and France. The statements of the public opinion propaganda organs of England and France are only part of wartime propaganda. The role is to deny and refute rumors in every way. At the same time, it also increases Hitler's vigilance, which instead promotes the consolidation of German-Italian relations. This, we only need to look at the continuous visits of German dignitaries to Italy in recent times to infer that Germany is using all its strength to prevent Italy from dismantling the stage.</p>
<p>Indeed, whether Italy will eventually break up with Germany is too important for the future European war situation, especially for the number of victories and defeats on both sides of England/France and Germany. To more thoroughly understand this issue, we might as well go further to its fundamental place.</p>
<p>Now suppose that even if Italy and the two sides of England and France have subjectively found a way to compromise, is it possible for her to withdraw from the German-Italian Axis?</p>

<p>C.J. Chancellor, Far East General Manager of Reuters British News Agency, left Shanghai last March, went north, and returned to England via Siberia. He has recently been appointed by the head office as a business inspection commissioner. He arrived east on a British Empire Airlines plane and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he gave a speech saying that the Soviet Union's intention to no longer aid Germany is obvious, and the Soviet Union's policy is to prevent any European country from expanding its power too much. Mr. Zhang flew the London to Moscow section of his journey with Sir Cripps, the newly appointed British Ambassador to the Soviet Union. According to Mr. Zhang, all parties in Britain are pleased with Cripps's new appointment, and the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union should become closer from now on. He also expressed his belief that the Soviet Union has stopped supplying Germany with raw materials. The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Stops Supplying Materials to Germany</p>
<p>Zhang Xuelou, General Manager of Reuters British News Agency, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday (the 9th). When discussing the international situation, he said that the Soviet Union seems to no longer have the intention of aiding Germany. He believes that the Soviet Union has now stopped supplying Germany with materials because the Soviet Union adheres to a policy of preventing any European country from becoming too strong. Britain is very pleased with the new appointment of Sir Cripps as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and expects that the relationship between the two countries will be greatly strengthened as a result. As for the relationship between the United States and the European war,</p>
<p>Does Not Hope the U.S. Will Participate in the War</p>
<p>Britain does not hope that the U.S. will participate in the war. The U.S.'s contribution to the war lies in (1) maintaining peace in the Far East and paying attention to the security of the Dutch East Indies, and (2) accelerating its production to supply materials to England and France. In the early stages of the war, Britain was overconfident and said, "We can maintain a free life while still fighting Germany." However, today, Britain has realized that the most critical moment is coming, and the people are also rising up and determined to fight to the end. Furthermore, the recent political changes in Britain have produced good results.</p>
<p>The New British Government Has Granted Special Privileges</p>
<p>The people completely trust Prime Minister Churchill. The British Parliament recently passed a bill granting the government centralized power to control all people's property, which is equivalent to Hitler's regime in Germany. The bill is the most radical political change in British history. This centralized power method is a necessary measure during wartime and is welcomed by the people of the whole country. Britain, like the United States, must now accelerate the production of its war supplies, so Britain is now like a huge arsenal.</p>
<p>The Far East Policy Will Not Change</p>
<p>As for Britain's policy toward the Far East, he believes that Britain will never recognize the possibility of the regime in power. Britain's policy toward the Far East will not change, but it needs the United States to provide even greater cooperation than before, according to Mr. Zhang who will stay in China for a month and then inspect Reuters news agency branches in other countries.</p>

<p>U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson was originally scheduled to leave Chongqing for Shanghai within a few days, but because the embassy still has important official business to deal with, he has postponed his departure from Chongqing. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency, there is still no definite date for the Ambassador's arrival in Shanghai. At the earliest, he can fly from Chongqing to Hong Kong around the 5th of next month, and then take the President Coolidge, a U.S. President Mail Line ship, to Shanghai. It is expected that the journey will arrive in port on July 10th. After staying in Shanghai for a short time, he will go to Beidaihe with his wife for a summer vacation. As for the rumored mediation of the Sino-Japanese war, it is completely groundless.</p>

<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the flagship Augusta of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will set sail to Qingdao this evening (the 10th) for its annual summer cruise in North China. The Dahua Theater specially screened the new film "Gone with the Wind" yesterday morning (the 9th) to entertain the officers and soldiers of the Augusta. Admiral Hart, the commander-in-chief, was also present to watch the film.

<p>A Japanese military spokesman announced at a press conference yesterday that Japanese planes will bomb Chinese ships anchored near Yichang. If third-country ships are anchored near Chinese ships, the Japanese side will ignore them. This is a warning issued by the Japanese side and has been notified to the diplomatic authorities of various countries in China. The British, German, and American sides have now received this notification. The spokesman also said that in the past, Japanese planes bombing Chinese ships were often scrupulous because third-country ships were anchored nearby. Today, the Japanese side has no time for this. Finally, the spokesman said that if the property of third countries is destroyed because the Chinese government implements a scorched earth policy, the responsibility for compensation should be borne by China, and the Japanese side will not be responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Conte Verde to Move Berth Tomorrow; Italian Nationals Concerned About the Situation; Rush to Embassies and Consulates to Inquire About News; Rumor of Transfer of Italian Troops in Western Shanghai Unconfirmed <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Italy's participation in the European war is becoming increasingly serious due to the order for Italian ships to dock in neutral ports. People in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, are paying great attention to this. According to a well-informed foreigner yesterday, although Italy's participation in the war has reached a tense stage, it is still difficult to predict whether there will be any action. Furthermore, the Italian embassies and consulates in Shanghai have not received any orders until recently. Therefore, it is generally believed that Italy will not participate in the war in the short term. Furthermore, the Italian ship Conte Verde may move to the Hong Kong Floating Dock tomorrow, and the Italian defense forces in western Shanghai will not be transferred to Hongkou. The details are described below:</p>
<p>To Move to the Pujiang River Hong Kong Floating Dock Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Italian mail ship Conte Verde is still temporarily anchored at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Tomorrow, it may move to the Pujiang River floating dock. A Western newspaper reporter met with the ship's captain, Ugo Ghiglia, and asked whether Italy would participate in the war and whether the ship's move was a sign that Italy was about to participate in the war. He replied, "I am only a captain and do not talk about politics. Only Prime Minister Mussolini knows everything. The people absolutely trust the Prime Minister, and we only carry out orders." He was also asked, "Will the connection between the Far East and Italy be cut off?" He replied, "This is the last passenger ship."</p>
<p>European Mail to Be Reloaded on Dutch Ship</p>
<p>The Conte Verde was originally scheduled to sail to Europe as usual on the 9th, so the post office had a large batch of foreign mail handed over to the ship to be taken to Hong Kong. It was expected that the journey would catch up with the China-America, China-France, and Royal airlines departing from Hong Kong today. Because the ship was suddenly ordered to stop sailing, the mail was delayed. Except for some domestic mail in the southwest direction, which has been reloaded on other ships to be transported to Hong Kong, the remaining foreign mail will be reloaded on the Dutch ship Zitza Linka for transportation. It is reported that the ship arrived in port at noon yesterday, carrying more than 1,000 passengers, and will return to Surabaya on the 13th.</p>
<p>Chinese-Italian Ships Can Still Sail</p>
<p>Since Italian ships were ordered to dock in various neutral ports, the only ship still sailing is the De Ping of the China-Italy Shipping Company, because the ship sails along the coast of China. According to international law, within 300 nautical miles of a neutral country, the enemy's navy cannot capture it. As for the Nanyang liners of the China-Italy Company, such as Conte Rosso, Indo, Eridano, and Bardo, they sailed into the Pujiang River blockade line one after another at the end of last month and are being repaired at the Nanshi shipyard. They have not yet been completed. After the ships are repaired, it may not be possible to resume sailing to Nanyang for a while, so it is temporarily planned not to leave the shipyard.</p>
<p>Italian Troops in Western Shanghai Have Not Been Transferred</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a rumor in the port that the line army stationed in western Shanghai would be transferred from the western Shanghai defense area to Hongkou. Shanghai Italian Defense Force Commander T.V. GMorate solemnly denied it yesterday. He said, "This kind of rumor is completely groundless." Furthermore, according to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency who continued to patrol the Italian military defense area along Route Roberts in western Shanghai yesterday, all the Italian troops stationed in western Shanghai, the San Marco Battalion, are currently stationed as usual and have not changed. This proves that the above rumor is completely false.</p>
<p>Italian Nationals in Shanghai Are Deeply Uneasy</p>
<p>There are about 200 Italian nationals in China in the Italian concession in Tianjin, more than 40 in the inland provinces, 500 in the coastal occupied areas, and more than 520 in Shanghai, as well as more than 130 missionaries. Their occupations mainly include industry, commerce, finance, import and export, trade, rayon sales, etc. Ambassador Mattio and Consul Nannoni, the head of the consular corps, and all the editors are now gathered in Shanghai to await the new orders of the Italian government to participate in the war. The Italian nationals are extremely concerned about the development of the serious situation in the future. Although they maintain a calm front on the surface, they are quite uneasy in their hearts. In recent days, they have rushed to the embassy and consulate to inquire about military information.</p>

<p>The French government has expanded its fundraising campaign to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and relieve the refugees in the war zone, and has designated the 16th of this month as French Red Cross Day to raise public awareness. French nationals in the port have also responded and intensified fundraising this week. Up to recently, the donations from French nationals in Shanghai have been exceptionally satisfactory, and the amount has exceeded the original expectations. Adding the donations from French nationals in Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, etc., the total amount is even more considerable.</p>
<p>After sculptor Zhang Chongren and his classmates studying in Belgium responded to the appeal of Belgian Ambassador de Guire's declaration, they formulated a fundraising plan. Anyone who donates more than 1,000 yuan will receive a portrait painted by Zhang Chongren. After this plan was approved by Ambassador de Guire, people from all walks of life in China and foreign countries went to the embassy and the Sino-Belgian Bank to donate enthusiastically. On the one hand, they sympathize with Belgium for being ravaged and the soldiers on the front lines for fighting bloody battles, and on the other hand, they are attracted by the exquisite art. It is reported that since the fundraising began, the results have been very good, and the donations have been remitted to the country's Red Cross or medical supplies have been purchased and sent to the front and rear of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Hindering the Shipment of Rice to Ningbo Again: The "Ruitai" Still Unable to Leave Port; Company Negotiates with the Japanese <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Due to severe drought in Ningbo and Shaoxing, a lack of rice, and people resorting to eating tree bark and wild grass, the misery is unparalleled. Reports of the situation have been repeatedly published in newspapers, and all sectors of Shanghai have been donating generously to purchase rice for relief. For the convenience of loading and unloading relief rice, the authorities specially allowed small rice transport ships traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo to enter the blockade line to the north bank of the Yangtze River. However, the Japanese military is interfering unreasonably, showing a lack of humanity. On the 23rd of last month, the German company Jebsen &amp; Jessen's "Haifu" ship, carrying two barges of relief rice to Ningbo, was detained by the Japanese naval constabulary. After its release, the ship was unable to sail to Ningbo in time. It was refused entry at the mouth of the Yangtze River because the relief rice was not loaded, and other goods could not be unloaded either. After requesting assistance from the authorities, it was allowed to anchor at the mouth of Zhenhai for ten days, resulting in considerable losses. This situation has been reported in previous newspapers. It is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Ruitai" ship, which operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was transporting relief rice. The ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday (the 9th) and was scheduled to sail to Ningbo again at 4:00 PM today. Yesterday morning, the ship sailed to the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to load 2,000 bags of rice for transport to Ningbo. Unexpectedly, the Japanese naval constabulary came again to obstruct the loading. The shipowner immediately reported to the company, and the company's chief manager is negotiating. As of last night, there was still no result. The ship is still docked at the Shuntai Wharf, waiting for a resolution. Whether it will leave port today depends on whether the relief rice can be loaded.</p>
<h3 id="e40">China Can Never Be Completely Blockaded; International Routes Remain Open; Soviet Trucks Delivering Military Supplies Stay in China; Inland China Has 14,000 Trucks; Detailed Investigation by London Times Reporter <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Since coastal ports and major railway lines have fallen into Japanese hands, the issue of inland transportation and transport has become increasingly important. The Chongqing correspondent of the London Times has conducted a detailed investigation into the inland transportation situation. According to the report, the strength of China's resistance is closely related to the transportation in the rear areas. Since major ports, rivers, and railways have fallen into Japanese hands, the transportation between the inland areas and overseas has attracted considerable attention. China needs to exchange inland resources for overseas military supplies.</p>
<p>Three Major Trunk Lines</p>
<p>Since the fall of Nanning in November of last year, difficulties have arisen because Nanning is a hub for highways and rivers. Goods unloaded from seagoing vessels are mostly transported by trucks to Nanning, and tung oil is also mostly transported through this route for export via Haiphong. However, China still has three major trunk lines for transportation to and from foreign countries. One is the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which is well-known and needs no further elaboration. The second is the China-Burma Road, which stretches for 1,100 kilometers. Due to the climate in the areas it passes through, this road is indeed a valuable route. However, using it to transport goods is very uneconomical. According to expert opinion, air transport is more cost-effective. Although there are considerable difficulties, this road is still open. The third is the China-Soviet route, also known as the "Red Road."</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Trucks</p>
<p>It runs from Lanzhou directly to the Turkish-Siberian Railway in the Soviet Union. On this route, only trucks traveling from the Soviet Union to China are available. Trucks transporting military supplies from the Soviet Union usually stay in China and do not return. Goods exported from China to the Soviet Union are mostly loaded onto neutral ships in the south and transported to Vladivostok or Odessa on the Black Sea. In addition, there is also trade that passes through the Japanese blockade line. No country in the world is as difficult to blockade as China, because of its vast territory, the resilience of its people, their simple lifestyle, their special ability to overcome difficulties, and the abundance of natural resources that allow it to be self-sufficient without relying on outside assistance.</p>
<p>Sufficient Military Supplies</p>
<p>The fall of Nanning did not have a major impact on China, but simply forced China to change its routes. Now, there are more river boats in Guangxi Province, and the number of trucks on the China-Burma Road is also more frequent than in the past. Even if China is completely isolated from the outside world, the stored military supplies are sufficient for at least two years. Since the outbreak of the European war, the source of foreign military equipment has decreased, so the use of stored goods cannot be underestimated. According to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the current amount is sufficient for long-term use, so there is no need to worry about shortages.</p>
<p>Well-Managed</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 14,000 trucks in inland China, mostly made in the United States. Those traveling on the China-Burma Road are mostly made in Britain. The management of roads and vehicles is not yet perfect. There is a lack of well-trained truck drivers, and their salaries are too low. Now, American road experts are assisting in the reorganization in Chongqing, and progress is being made daily. There is a shortage of auto parts and materials in inland China, and about 30% of the vehicles cannot be used because they need replacement parts.</p>
<p>Swift Air Transportation</p>
<p>As for aviation, both China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation are still flying as usual during wartime. Currently, Chongqing, Guilin, Hong Kong, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, and Hanoi are connected by air. At the end of November of last year, the Chongqing-Rangoon route was opened. In December, the Lanzhou line was extended to Hami, connecting with the Soviet air route to reach Moscow. Mail from London to Chongqing takes only one week, and from Moscow to Chongqing, it takes only four days. Many places in inland China still maintain their primitive lifestyle, which contrasts sharply with the latest transportation equipment, which is also amazing.</p>

<p>According to Da Zhong News Agency, since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association implemented the dispersal of refugees, it has dispersed two batches successively. It is reported that the refugees in various refugee shelters in Nanshi who are young and strong will also be dispersed before the end of this month. This decision by the Nanshi Refugee Area Office is entirely due to the decrease in donations received in the past few months, which has resulted in a shortage of funds for refugee supplies. It is also learned that the young and strong refugees and those who voluntarily seek a living outside have now begun to register.</p>

<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the war in Europe, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to strictly prevent the leakage of military secrets, have strictly prohibited the unauthorized carrying of letters. All letters and documents entering and leaving Hong Kong must be sent through the post office or inspected by a postal and telegraph inspector. Otherwise, they must not be transported privately; otherwise, they will be charged with violating wartime laws. Yesterday, it was learned from the Shanghai Postal Bureau that the Hong Kong authorities, in order to strictly prevent such situations, have issued new regulations. All letters and documents must not be sent by other means except through the post office. Otherwise, the sender and the person who transports the letter without authorization will be charged with violating wartime laws, and the sender and the carrier will be punished equally. Therefore, all persons entering and leaving Hong Kong ports must pay close attention.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Formal Proposal to Restrict Rent Increases to be Submitted; Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council Plan to Submit a Written Proposal; Shanghai French Concession Ratepayers' Association to Send Representatives <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Although the issue of increased taxes in the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession from the first of next month has been repeatedly raised by the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, requesting the Municipal Council to postpone implementation, and the French Concession Ratepayers' Association has also sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting exemption, the authorities of both concessions seem to have no room for reversal. However, landlords will inevitably use the excuse of tax increases to raise rents on sub-tenants. Therefore, rent increase disputes within the concessions will inevitably emerge one after another. At a time when the cost of living is already difficult for ordinary residents to maintain, how can they bear additional burdens? The Chinese Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Ratepayers' Association, in view of this, have separately prepared proposals to the concession authorities on the issue of restricting rent increases. According to the Ping Ming News Agency reporter, who learned from reliable sources yesterday,</p>
<p>The Chinese Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council will submit a written proposal to the Municipal Council Board of Directors. They are now collecting opinions from all parties and starting to draft it. This proposal will first be submitted to the subcommittee of the Municipal Council and then to the Board of Directors for approval. However, it is feared that the upcoming regular meeting on the 15th will be too late, but it is resolved to submit it at the last regular meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors before the summer recess on the 26th of this month. As for the French Concession</p>
<p>The Ratepayers' Association has also decided to send four representatives to discuss solutions with the French Municipal Council. As for the selection of representatives, in addition to Xu Maotang on the landlord side, another landlord representative has also been decided, with the Association's Chinese Committee member Qu Zhenhua taking on the role. The two tenant representatives will be produced soon. Residents hope that it will be carried out quickly and that measures will be promulgated by the end of this month at the latest so that there is a basis to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>This year's Public Concession Safety Campaign Week is scheduled to begin on the 17th of this month. Twenty-one secondary schools in the Public Concession, including Zhengzhong, Yuying, etc., have sent a total of 920 students to participate in the assistance, serving in 86 busy locations, with four to eight students from each school serving in each location. In order to take into account the graduation of the students, the authorities have divided the workers into two groups for rotation. One group is from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, and the other group is from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM and from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. The responsible authorities also hope that the students participating in the campaign will guide pedestrians in an advisory manner to avoid accidental disputes. The authorities believe that primary school students are most affected by vehicle accidents, so it is stipulated that all primary schools in the Concession must hold safety lectures during Safety Week. The lecture materials have been printed and distributed to each school by the authorities. The propaganda materials for the Safety Campaign have also been printed and will be posted in various public places, transportation vehicles, and streets starting on the 17th. Various groups, such as the rickshaw guild, have also automatically printed the propaganda materials to provide assistance. However, the responsible authorities believe that picture propaganda has the widest effect, so they hope that various assistance groups will prepare more picture propaganda materials.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Jardine Matheson Stevedores' Strike Resolved Quickly; Swire Dockworkers' Strike Still Deadlocked; Six Ships Stranded in Shanghai, Unable to Set Sail <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The strike by stevedores of the British company Butterfield &amp; Swire has lasted for five days as of yesterday and there is still no hope of resolution. The day before yesterday (Sunday), Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s stevedores also made</p>
<p>The same request. Jardine's ships docked at Shuntai Wharf and Huashun Wharf in Hongkou, which were contracted by the Ou Jinjiang and Ou Jinxiang brothers. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the north wharves have all been occupied by the Japanese army, making it extremely inconvenient for the company's ships to dock and unload cargo. They then changed to the Roosevelt Wharf (formerly Jin Liyuan Wharf) on the Xinkai River in the French Concession for loading and unloading work, which was still contracted by the Ou brothers. The day before yesterday (the 9th) afternoon, the company's Desheng ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, bringing a large number of foreign rice, over 10,000 bags, and about 20,000 pieces of other goods. For the sake of the ship's schedule, the company purchased holiday work and night work from the Customs in advance so that the ship could start unloading immediately. Unexpectedly, the workers took this opportunity to request</p>
<p>Increased wages and refused to work, causing the goods on the Desheng ship to remain unloaded on the previous day, and there was a threat of the labor unrest expanding. Later, the foreman dealt with the situation quickly and immediately promised the workers to temporarily increase the wage by 26 cents from today. The original price was 1.3 yuan per shift, and now it is 1.56 yuan. In the future, after the Swire workers' strike is resolved, the wage amount will be the same. The workers were satisfied and resumed work yesterday morning. After Swire &amp; Co. learned of this, they also hinted to the foreman to follow the example of the Jardine Matheson workers. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the foreman and workers' representatives were still meeting on the top floor of 36 Wing On Street. At that time, the foreman's representative proposed that the wages should temporarily follow</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson workers' standard, and the rest should be discussed at length after the resumption of work. However, the workers' representatives insisted that the minimum wage should be 2 yuan per shift, and they would not resume work without it being resolved. Therefore, yesterday's negotiations still failed to yield any results. However, Swire's ships in Shanghai were unable to set sail, and the number of ships arriving in Shanghai was gradually increasing. There were originally four ships, including Hunan, Qiongzhou, Yingzhou, and Shuntian. The Shuntian ship sailed empty to North China on Saturday morning, and the other three ships were waiting to load and unload cargo. On Saturday, the New Peking ship arrived in Shanghai from North China, and yesterday and the day before yesterday, the Jinan and Suzhou ships arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. The Jinan ship suddenly left port at dawn yesterday and anchored outside Wusong, waiting for the labor unrest to subside before returning to port to unload cargo.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of the great Portuguese poet Camões. The local Portuguese community gathered at the Portuguese General Association last night to hold a commemorative ceremony. Camões was born in Lisbon in 1524 and is famous for his epic poem "Os Lusíadas". His early life was quite like a myth, difficult to believe. It is only known that he studied in Coimbra, studying</p>
<p>The skills of Latin poets and the myths of Greece and Rome. The date he left Coimbra is not correctly recorded in the historical records either. Later, he returned to Lisbon and worked there, but was soon exiled to the Ribatejo region due to political reasons. He soon returned to Lisbon. At that time, the "History of Portugal's Discovery and Conquest of India" was published. Camões</p>
<p>He was deeply moved and believed that his great epic poem was greatly influenced by this book. In 1553, Camões decided to serve in India and bought a boat to the east, staying in Asia for 16 years. After that, he traveled to other places. In 1567, he returned to his home country, but his misfortunes were not eliminated. In 1569, he was imprisoned again in</p>
<p>An African prison. He was rescued by friends and was able to return to his hometown. After that, he devoted himself to writing "Os Lusíadas", which was completed at this time, but he suffered from poverty and disease and died miserably in his later years. On June 10, 1580, he died of illness in Lisbon.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration's parcel business division resumed the posting of large and small parcels to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces at the beginning of last month, it has been more than a month. The parcels posted daily have been loaded onto ships and transported to Haiphong, and then transferred by train on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming. However, due to the large amount of cargo on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it cannot load a large amount, resulting in a large number of parcels accumulating in the Haiphong warehouse. It is learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration has received a telegram from the Haiphong Postal Bureau stating that due to transportation difficulties, the collection of large and small parcels from Shanghai to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces will be temporarily suspended. The Bureau has notified the relevant departments separately and announced as follows: "Due to transportation difficulties, the collection of all parcels to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces will be temporarily suspended from the 10th of this month.

<p>According to custom, Chinese banks are responsible for identifying the seals of depositors. That is, if someone privately carves a seal and impersonates a depositor to withdraw funds, the bank is responsible. This is the opposite of Western banks. Recently, someone in the Shanghai Banking Association suggested that banks are not experts in identifying seals, and it is excessive to be responsible for this. Therefore, it was proposed that Chinese banks should also follow the Western banks' approach, and if the seal does not match, the bank will not be responsible. The Banking Association resolved to consider this, and it has now submitted the proposal to the Banking Institute for study. It is learned that although no concrete measures have been produced, most people believe that if Western banks' measures are followed, there will be many abuses. The reason why Western banks have such regulations is because foreigners use signatures to represent seals, which is different from Chinese banks. Therefore, a compromise should be adopted. That is, if the seal does not match and it is obvious at a glance, the bank should be responsible. However, if the difference is minimal and cannot be identified by non-experts, the depositor should be responsible. The Institute is still continuing to study this matter.</p>

<p>According to a Ping Min News Agency investigation, the charity donations for entertainment venues and cinemas and theaters in the French Concession will be increased again starting on July 1. Previously, this charity donation was collected based on the ticket price. All tickets priced at 50 cents or less were subject to a 10% donation, tickets priced above 50 cents and up to 2 yuan were subject to a 5% donation, and tickets priced above 2 yuan were subject to a 10 cent donation. However, after July 1, this charity donation will be uniformly collected at 10% of the ticket price (i.e., 10%). Therefore, the higher the ticket price, the more charity donations that will be paid.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Police Patrol Tongfu Road Throughout the Night to Prevent Theft, Robbery, Gunfire, etc.; The Purpose of the So-Called Economic Research Association is to Seize Everyone's Money <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, there is a so-called "Economic Research Association" at 82 Tongfu Road, which is said to be run by the Japanese. It has been established for a long time, but it has not yet officially opened. Recently, whether it can open is still a question. A large number of police officers from the Municipal Council patrol outside the Association and search pedestrians entering the "Association" every night. As a result, there are few people who come to seek pleasure. What is the true purpose of the establishment of the "Association" is still a mystery. The police have never entered to inspect it. A famous news broadcaster stated in a newspaper about the "Association" that it is quite appropriate for the Japanese to name the "Association" the "Economic Research Association" because it will investigate everyone's economic situation and seize their economy. This "Association" is located at 82 Tongfu Road in the central district of the Public Concession. Several months ago, it was named the "Sino-Japanese Research Association." It was renamed several weeks ago. How the Association was able to open in the Concession has become an official secret. As far as he knows, the Association is supported by the Japanese government, so the Municipal Council is currently hesitating to take direct action to close the Association. However, every night, police officers and patrol cars shuttle back and forth around the "Association," so the "Association" has little opportunity to conduct "economic investigations." The Association's organizer has repeatedly resolved to negotiate with the police authorities, saying that the police patrols in the vicinity of the Association every night greatly hinder the "business" of the Association. However, the police authorities believe that the purpose of this measure is to maintain law and order and cannot allow any shooting incidents to occur in the Tongfu Road area. Therefore, the police will continue to patrol there as usual.</p>

<p>At about 0:40 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at Guangrentang Chinese Pharmacy at 230-232 Burton Road in the Public Concession. Because it was midnight, the fire was already out of control when it was discovered. The Hongkou Shenjiawan Fire Brigade and the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with pumping trucks and tried their best to put out the fire. However, due to the severe drought and the strong flames, it was not easy to extinguish the fire. As a result, in addition to burning down the two city buildings of the Chinese pharmacy, along with the business and medicinal materials, it also affected the three city buildings of Dingtai Silk Shop at 224-228, the one building of a tobacco and paper shop at 226, and the one building of Dingxiang Photo Studio at 228, along with</p>
<p>Goods and assets also turned to ashes, resulting in huge losses. The entire building of a foreign goods store at 234-238 also turned to ashes. A total of more than three hours of burning. When the fire was raging, eight men and women died in the fire. The names are as follows: Dong Baokang (28 years old), Han Xinyue (26 years old), Shen Yifei (25 years old), Dong Fakang (22 years old), Dong Hongkang (15 years old), Sun Daxin (40 years old), all men, Zhou Qinghe (girl, 6 years old), Zhou Qingzhu (girl, 2 years old). They were all fast asleep at the time. By the time they were awakened by the fire, the thick smoke was swirling around and the stairs were burned.</p>
<p>Unable to escape, they were later dug out from the rubble by firefighters. Each was burned beyond recognition, a tragic sight. Two women, Zhou He (31 years old) and Zhou Jinzhu (11 years old), suffered burns all over their bodies. They were rushed to the Xizang Road Refugee Hospital for treatment by ambulance. As for the cause of the fire at the pharmacy, the police have taken the owner of the shop, Zhou Zhicheng, to the police station for questioning and investigation.</p>

<p>Xi Shaofen, a woman from Nanhui and former employee of two railway bureaus, and Feng Ruizhang, a man from Wujin and student at Shanghai Law College, were jointly sued in the Special Number Two Court by lawyers Chen Zongtao, Xu Wufang, and Lu Ronggan, all youths from Guangdong Province, for allegedly defrauding a large sum of 37,300 yuan in checks. Presiding Judge Li has held two hearings, ordering the defendants to provide a surety deposit of 15,000 yuan. This was previously reported. The hearing continued yesterday morning. The court questioned the defendant Xi Shaofen about the funds given to the plaintiff. While she claimed that 15,000 yuan of it was a check borrowed from her colleague Zhang Binren at the Ministry of Railways, the receipt was issued by Feng Ruizhang. Furthermore, there was no receipt for the remaining 10,000 yuan in cash. Where did that come from? The so-called witness surnamed Xu also failed to appear in court, revealing contradictions in the testimony. Is there anything else that needs to be said truthfully? Xi replied that 15,000 yuan was borrowed from Zhang Binren, hence the receipt. The rest of the money belonged to her, so no receipt was issued. Her remaining answers were evasive. The court, deeming the case clear, ordered the debate to commence and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 13th. The defendants were released on bail pending judgment.</p>

<p>Cheng Zuxian, 30 years old, a local resident and manager of the Oriental Chemical Industrial Society at No. 164, Lane 1, Route Cardinal Foch, recently hired lawyer Shen Zongyong to file a complaint accusing Yu Yiheng, manager of the Baimei Company at No. 18, Model Village, 887 Route Cardinal Foch, of trademark infringement. He requested legal punishment and, in a supplementary civil suit, demanded that the defendant cease production and destroy the "Mei Di Fu" trademark already on the market. The plaintiff claimed that he established the Oriental Chemical Industrial Society, specializing in the manufacture of various cosmetics for many years, including the "Mei Di" cream, which is sold throughout the region. He had registered "Mei Di" as his exclusive trademark, but the defendant's "Mei Di Fu" completely imitated the registered trademark of the plaintiff, leading to confusion in the marketplace and causing consumers to mistakenly believe it was a product from the plaintiff's factory. This not only deceived others but also caused significant losses to the plaintiff. The case was initially heard by Presiding Judge Jiang yesterday. The defendant argued that the trademark was slightly similar, but the quality was different, requesting a declaration of innocence. The court deemed further investigation necessary and ordered a new hearing on a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Changes Course: Wartime Local and Primary Social Education (3) <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(11) Advocate Production Labor Training for Elementary School Students. Production labor training was originally outlined in the Ministry of Education's Special Education Outline for Elementary Schools. In order to specially promote and universally implement it, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has formulated the "Implementation Measures for Production Labor Training of Elementary School Students in Jiangsu Province" so that all elementary schools have concrete plans and methods when implementing this training, ensuring that children acquire knowledge, skills, interests, and habits of production labor, in order to increase the efficiency of anti-Japanese national reconstruction production education.</p>
<p>(12) Promulgation of Implementation Measures for Preventing and Destroying Enslavement Education. This semester, in order to strengthen the efficiency of preventing and destroying enslavement education in the occupied counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education formulated and promulgated implementation measures to the counties for earnest implementation.</p>
<p>(13) Increase the Salaries of Elementary School Teachers. It has been found that the salaries of elementary school teachers in various counties of this province are mostly over ten yuan, making it difficult to maintain a livelihood. As the War of Resistance is tense and the cost of living increases, the amount of salary has not been able to meet the needs and increase with the times. Moreover, many counties distribute salaries in kind or accumulate arrears for months. When the counties formulate their budgets this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education ordered all counties to follow the instructions of the President on January 16 this year, and must increase teachers' salaries as much as possible according to the economic conditions of each county, and establish three principles: 1. Maintain independent education funds; 2. Eliminate discounts; 3. Increase salaries, in order to review the budgets of each county. Since the promulgation of the order, the salaries of teachers in each county have been uniformly increased, by two to four yuan per teacher compared to the previous year. For example, in Funing County, where the education funds were misappropriated by the local government, leaving only 60,000 yuan, the amount has now been increased to 200,000 yuan. This is a true reflection of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's maintenance of education funds this year.</p>
<p>B. Social Education</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of Wartime Educational Mobile Work Teams. The main purpose of establishing these teams is to adapt to wartime needs, promote social education, organize and train the public, and promote mobilization in order to strengthen the power of resistance and national reconstruction. Currently, one team is tentatively established in each administrative region of Jiangsu Province, with the counties under each district as the scope of work for each team. This semester, four teams will be established in northern Jiangsu first.</p>
<p>(2) Increase the Number of Wartime Public Schools. In the previous year, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education originally established five wartime public schools in Wujin and Yixing in southern Jiangsu. This semester, it jointly established wartime public schools with the Provincial Party Department, and established them universally in the counties of northern Jiangsu. It is planned to establish twenty schools in the first step, and openly recruit principals and teachers for the public schools. In addition, a wartime experimental public school was established in northern Jiangsu to serve as a hub for promoting public education in various counties through phased mobile universal education.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Library Committee. The important task of this committee is to plan and promote the library cause in the province, especially focusing on the collection of local literature during the war, sorting out classics, collecting stories of martyrs, and compiling the history of the War of Resistance. In addition to the Director of the Department of Education, the Secretary, the Head of the Responsible Section, and the editors as ex officio members, five to seven scholars and experts in the province who have rich experience in library collection or in-depth research will be selected as appointed members. The organization has already started work and is an important step for Jiangsu culture during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(4) Adjust the Mobile Electrochemical Education Touring Teams. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education originally established two electrochemical education touring teams. However, in the past, the work often failed to meet the expected standards. At the beginning of this semester, the Department specifically promulgated detailed guidelines for the work of the electrochemical education touring teams, specifying the points that should be paid attention to when teaching, in order to use electrochemical education to stimulate the public's anti-Japanese emotions, instill the public with common sense about national reconstruction, and promote the national spirit, and to implement the work of wartime public education. One of the teams that has been established has long been conducting mobile universal education in the countryside of various counties in northern Jiangsu in accordance with the planned plan.</p>
<p>(5) Supervise Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education. Since the Ministry of Education promulgated measures for schools at all levels to concurrently run social education, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has attached special importance to it. The assessment of all provincial and county schools at all levels that concurrently run public schools and other social education facilities is extremely serious. In addition to listing the achievements of each school in concurrently running social education as an important assessment, the provincial and county supervisors or education commissions are specifically ordered to conduct strict assessments and guidance during supervision, in order to widely promote wartime social education and use local schools as the center for promoting social education, with little expense and much success, so that schools and society become one.</p>
<p>(6) Organize Mobile Libraries in Various Counties. Since the war, most of the libraries established in various counties in northern Jiangsu have been suspended, and all kinds of books have been shelved and not used, which is a pity. In order to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance, increase public knowledge, cultivate a reading style, and improve social culture, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education specifically ordered each county to establish at least one original mobile library. Those counties that have already established libraries or peasant education centers should attach a mobile library to the center, and stipulate that each library should universally tour the townships in principle, and engage in lectures on current affairs related to the War of Resistance during the tour, in order to strengthen the public's belief in the victory of the War of Resistance and arouse the public's motivation to learn to read and write.

<h3 id="e73">Dragon Boat Festival and Agriculture and Commerce <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Nan</p>
<p>In China, many traditional festivals are related to agricultural affairs. Industry and commerce shift with agricultural activities, and the Dragon Boat Festival is one such example.</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is especially valued in the Jiangnan region because it coincides with the silkworm season and wheat ripening. After this time, the rainy season arrives, and farmers are busy transplanting rice seedlings and cultivating fields. Therefore, the Dragon Boat Festival provides everyone with an opportunity to enjoy themselves, recuperate from fatigue, and then engage in production. It was originally an indispensable form of entertainment for the common people.</p>
<p>The biggest goal of celebrating festivals is entertainment. In ancient times, it also contained the meaning of thanking the deities. Because the Chinese people's observation of nature is largely similar to that of various religions, they also consider the supreme ruler to be the "Heavenly Emperor and Earthly Mother," and all of life is bestowed by heaven, which can be fully expressed in the saying, "relying on heaven for food." Extending human affairs to speak of the Way of Heaven, it is believed that the gods in the sky are like officials in the human world, each with their own duties, each managing their own affairs. Thus, there is a Field God, an Earth Mother, and a Silkworm God (actually Luozu, hence the sculpting of a goddess statue), which has become the polytheism of later generations. Therefore, whenever there is a harvest, it is of course necessary to thank the gods, believing it to be due to the protection of the deities. Even if there is no harvest, one must also pray to the deities to avert disasters. In fact, this kind of thinking exists under every kind of religion. However, the Chinese people admire polytheism, so they have to thank the gods every festival. After thanking the gods, they share the offerings, drink, and enjoy themselves greatly.</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is the time for silkworm and wheat ripening. In old China, where the credit system prevailed, all transactions relied on credit. Under the small-peasant system, most farmers were poor (the reasons for this are quite complex). If they wanted to purchase goods from shops, transacting in cash everywhere was definitely beyond the means of ordinary farmers. If they insisted on doing so, it would inevitably restrict the purchasing power of the farmers, which would ultimately be detrimental to the merchants. Therefore, rural shops would rather make higher profits and extend credit to the common people, waiting until the three major festivals to collect the payments from the farmers. The farmers also avoided spending cash temporarily and preferred to pay a higher price, obtaining the necessary goods on credit, waiting for their agricultural products to enter the market, exchanging them for money, and repaying their debts. This became an accounting period for commerce.</p>
<p>Celebrating festivals is "partly for the gods, partly for the people," which is also a popular belief among the common people. Since this is the case, one can largely see the state of agricultural production during this period by observing what people "eat" during each festival. Taking the Dragon Boat Festival as an example, what is eaten is zongzi, which was called "jiaoshu" in ancient times. Southern zongzi are mostly made with glutinous rice. Why were they called "jiaoshu" in ancient times? This shows that the custom of eating zongzi spread from north to south and has ancient origins. Because the north does not produce rice, but in ancient times, millet and sorghum were widely cultivated. According to the "Monthly Ordinances," May is the time when new millet enters the market, so people "taste the new," using millet to wrap zongzi. Moreover, millet has a fragrant aroma and can also be used to make wine. It is naturally as sticky as glutinous rice, so it is suitable for wrapping. The south does not produce millet but produces rice, so glutinous rice is used instead. If ordinary rice were used, it would be difficult to wrap together. Therefore, zongzi must be wrapped with either millet or glutinous rice, but millet is not as sticky as glutinous rice and was eventually eliminated!</p>
<p>The "jiao" of "jiaoshu" perhaps, because millet lacks the stickiness of glutinous rice, was eventually eliminated! Those sold today are mostly rectangular, like pillows, which have already lost their ancient meaning.</p>
<p>In addition to zongzi, people also eat loquats and wear pomegranate flowers. Eating loquats during the Dragon Boat Festival is like eating cherries at the Beginning of Summer. The loquats sold in Shanghai are mostly from Tangqi (red variety and white sand variety) and the white sand loquats from Dongting Mountain. However, this year, Tangqi loquats are hard to come by, and those sold on the market, although large in size, are not good native varieties.</p>
<p>Pomegranate flowers bloom during the Dragon Boat Festival, so before women cut their hair, they would cut a fresh, bright red and green pomegranate flower with leaves on the Dragon Boat Festival and insert it into their glossy black hair, which was very beautiful. Unfortunately, it is now rare to see. In fact, the custom of wearing flowers was not only for women in ancient times, but men also often inserted them into their crowns or hair buns, just like Westerners today who insert flowers into their pockets for decoration.</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is not only for "tasting new things" and entertainment but also for public health and epidemic prevention in ancient times. This important significance still prevails today, but people have "forgotten their ancestors" and know what is done but not why, which is lamentable!</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is around the time of the Grain in Ear solar term, which is the season of plum rains. After the Dragon Boat Festival, insects proliferate, and mold and heat invade, making it easy to breed epidemics. People in ancient times did not know that epidemics could be transmitted, attributing them to disasters from heaven or the influence of poisonous substances. Therefore, it was necessary to ward off evil and dispel toxins. Warding off evil included pasting Taoist talismans and images of Zhong Kui from the first day of the fifth month, which is close to superstition. Dispelling toxins included hanging mugwort, calamus, and garlic, burning artemisia, angelica, and rue, drinking realgar wine, and suppressing the five poisonous creatures. All of these were directly or indirectly related to dispelling toxins and preventing epidemics. Due to space limitations, I cannot elaborate further. Readers only need to do some research to understand their purpose. As for the "suppressing" aspect, it is also a legacy of ancient Chinese witchcraft. Originally, it was a custom in the ancient Qingqi area to draw talismans of the five poisonous creatures (scorpions, centipedes, snakes, bees, and toads) on the Grain Rain solar term, piercing each with a needle, and posting them in homes to ward off poisonous insects. This is the origin of today's Taoist talismans and the practice of warding off the five poisonous creatures, except it is done on the Dragon Boat Festival instead of the Grain Rain solar term! In the past, new brides would give gifts on the Dragon Boat Festival, often embroidering tiger shapes with colored satin and attaching lizards, snakes, spiders, centipedes, toads, and the like to their abdomens. The form is slightly different, but the principle is the same. Because poisonous insects grow and harm people, it is hoped that their image can be used to suppress them. Later, people mistakenly regarded the fifth month as a poisonous month. In fact, the fifth month is not poisonous; it was originally used to dispel poison!</p>
<p>Due to the mistaken belief that the fifth month was a poisonous month, it is said that in ancient times, children born on the Dragon Boat Festival were considered to be born on a poisonous day in a poisonous month and were often not raised. This superstition was broken by Meng Changjun, Tian Wen. Later, because Tian Wen became noble, all those born on the Dragon Boat Festival were raised. According to Leng Qian's "Miscellaneous Additions," "Those born on the fifth day of the fifth month mentioned in historical books include Meng Changjun Tian Wen, Hu Guang, Zhang Huanhou Fei, Wang Feng, Wang Zhen'e, Emperor Gao Wei of the Northern Qi Dynasty, Wang Chuo, the Prince of Nanyang of the Northern Qi Dynasty, Cui Xinming, Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, Weng Yinglong, Ji Mai, Empress Yide of the Liao Dynasty, Zhao Yuanhao, etc." The name Wang Zhen'e clearly shows the ancient view of those born on the Dragon Boat Festival. The reporter was also born on the Dragon Boat Festival and has achieved nothing, feeling ashamed of the ancients!</p>
<p>Merchants often write May as "Duan Yue" (Upright Month), thinking that it is the month of the Dragon Boat Festival, hence the name. However, they do not know that the name "Duan Yue" already existed, but it was not used for May but for January. Because Qin Shi Huang's name was Zheng, he avoided using the word "Zheng," so he changed January to "Duan Yue." "Duan" means beginning, and "Duan Yue" is the first month of the year. Some believe that the "zheng" of "Zheng Yue" (January) should originally be pronounced like the "zheng" of "fangzheng" (upright), but later it was pronounced like the "zheng" of "zhengfa" (expedition). This is because the common people during the Qin Dynasty still called it "Zheng Yue," but to avoid the taboo of Emperor Shi Huang's name, they pronounced "zheng" with the sound of "zheng." As for the current custom of calling the first day of the tenth month "Shi Yue Chao," it is also a legacy of the Qin Dynasty. "Chao" is a shortened form of "Sui Chao" (New Year's Day). Because the Qin Dynasty established the Hai month, the first day of the tenth month was considered New Year's Day and called "Shi Yue Chao," which has been passed down to this day.</p>

<p>Due to the production areas being controlled by a certain party, the source of fuel firewood is difficult, resulting in scarce arrivals at the wharves in this city. The market is controlled by merchants, with large-sized "fanbai" firewood selling for 2.5 bundles per yuan, huangtan firewood for 3 bundles, and longyan firewood for 4.25 bundles. Small-sized "fanbai" firewood sells for 5 bundles. The above prices are for delivery by cart at the wharves of the trade; transportation by porters is extra.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and transactions in the woolen fabric trade were scarcer than in the previous two days because both buyers and sellers in the trade were busy settling debts. However, the volume of settlements was mostly more leisurely than in previous years. This is due to the special environment, where all transactions are now conducted in cash, and lending credit to customers is done with great caution.</p>

<p>Wives Have Wet Dreams at Night!</p>
<p>Young people often have erotic dreams and suffer from nocturnal emission, but women are also prone to this phenomenon. Generally speaking, virgins who have not been married rarely experience this, but women who have had marriage experience are prone to it if they feel their husbands have a weak sex drive.</p>
<p>If a husband can satisfy his wife in his sex life, this phenomenon will definitely not occur. However, many men often ejaculate prematurely and become impotent during intercourse. However, their wives, also due to weak sexual desire, although feeling bored, do not have the phenomenon of wet dreams. However, this phenomenon is inevitable for those with unusually strong sexual desire or widows.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the harm of a husband's weak sexual ability is as described above. As for the treatment methods, there are many. The most effective one is to take preparations made from the essence of male animal testicles (i.e., youth glands) (Boti Kang) is the most reliable. According to general circumstances, in addition to sexual excess and masturbation, impotence is also caused by worry and trouble. Therefore, attention should also be paid to its cause during treatment. If it is due to overwork and worry, physical and mental overwork should be avoided. Taking "Boti Kang" can quickly cure this symptom, which is easier to solve than impotence caused by sexual excess and masturbation.</p>
<p>If it is due to increasing age, one or two tablets of "Zhongti Kang" can be taken with boiling water every morning, which has the effect of prolonging life, and sexual ability can be maintained until the age of sixty, with vigorous spirit, clear eyes and ears, and undiminished appetite. The ingredients of "Boti Kang" do not contain impurities, and the animals whose testicular essence is extracted are all several types that are compatible with human physique and are extracted by scientific methods, so there are no side effects. Its tonicity focuses on supplementing the brain, kidney, and blood, and its nature is mild and does not hurt the stomach, so it is suitable for both the old and the young. It is completely different from the exciting medicines on the market. Women with irregular menstruation need to take female Boti Kang</p>

<p>The consumption of human energy in summer is often more intense than in the other three seasons. The reason is that the replenishment cannot keep up with the speed of consumption, so those who suffer from spermatorrhea are more likely to suffer the consequences. This disease must be treated as soon as possible. The following cured case of spermatorrhea is for reference.</p>
<p>The patient, Tao Baoding, is 23 years old and is from Jiangyin, Jiangsu Province. Self-reported: "I used to masturbate during development. I have quit. Semen often flows out when urinating or having an erection before marriage. I also have nocturnal emission. I feel extremely tired. The cause of the disease is masturbation. In recent years, my body has become weaker and weaker. My memory has greatly reduced. I often feel palpitations and feel tired after doing a little work. Please cure me." After examination, I found that Tao Jun had neurasthenia. I first prescribed "Naiersi Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop spermatorrhea and "Boti Kang" a male tonic made from German testicular essence to replenish deficiency. After taking the two medicines together for half a month, spermatorrhea had stopped. After taking it for another half month, it was completely cured, and there was no more semen flowing out after urination. I stopped taking the spermatorrhea medicine "and only took Boti Kang." After another month, all neurasthenia symptoms completely disappeared, "weight also increased by five pounds, and the treatment was very successful. The brain is healthy, the thinking is new, and everything is very satisfactory." Written by American medical doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<h3 id="e79">A Plan to Eradicate Gonorrhea <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Wang Kechun</p>
<p>Since the history of gonorrhea, there have been doctors who have been thinking hard and tirelessly researching the plan to eradicate gonorrhea. However, due to the lack of scientific development, it is impossible for many doctors to realize their ideals! Only in the 20th century, with the progress of science, it has been possible to conquer gonorrhea, which was once considered difficult to conquer, with scientific methods, and to realize the ideal gonorrhea special effect therapy of general doctors for thousands of years. Dr. Peter, a German gonorrhea university expert, devoted his life to first invent "Kelinong." The magnitude of its effect has long been known in the medical community, but Dr. Peter is still not satisfied. He went a step further and adopted a new chemical therapy and invented "New Kelinong," a medicine that treats gonorrhea even more perfectly! Therefore, its efficacy exceeds any well-known but ineffective chemical therapy on the market. For all acute and chronic leucorrhea, anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, and women's gonorrhea-related leukorrhea, taking "New Kelinong" (available at Chinese and Western pharmacies) can remove deep gonococci at once. For external use, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" (available at Taihe Pharmacy) can be used to secretly wash the urethra at home according to the diagrams and instructions. Women can use "Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories to eliminate discharge and turbidity, fundamentally cure it, and never relapse.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Causes and Consequences of Chronic Leucorrhea <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Juyan Medical Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>There are only a few causes of chronic gonorrhea: (1) The pain is unbearable during acute gonorrhea, and patients have to resort to illegal means to forcibly suppress the pain. (2) Because incompetent municipal doctors perform local washing methods with crude equipment, they forcibly induce gonococci into deep parts, infiltrating the internal reproductive organs, bladder, kidneys, blood joints, etc. Once gonorrhea invades these places, it is difficult to treat, and it naturally becomes chronic gonorrhea over time. (3) The patient does not follow the doctor's hygiene instructions, such as drinking alcohol and exertion, which will cause gonococci to advance inward and turn into terrible complications. Regarding the complications of such chronic leucorrhea, if you make one mistake after another, you will not only suffer from illness for years, but also cause major disasters to your own life and your wife. Based on more than 20 years of clinical experience, I believe that the only way to fundamentally solve stubborn chronic leucorrhea is to use the gonorrhea special drug "New Kelinong" to make the bactericidal power of "New Kelinong" occur wherever the gonococci go, surround and kill them. I also use German anti-gonococcal serum to help and eliminate the residual poison of gonococci, and use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally as a urethral detergent (patients can also wash themselves according to the diagrams and instructions). In terms of electrotherapy, I first recommend German static electrotherapy for its excellent effectiveness. This type of electrotherapy has a high bactericidal power and no adverse stimulation. (Note that "New Kelinong" and "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" are available at Taihe Pharmacy.</p>

<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing is a common symptom that everyone sees, but behind this symptom lies a very terrible consequence, which is pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, to prevent tuberculosis, you must first stop coughing, and to relieve cough and resolve phlegm, prevent tuberculosis and nourish the lungs, only the German medicine "Bofei Naer" has these four beautiful effects.</p>
<p>There was a patient named Liu Fuliang, who was 20 years old, who developed a cough due to a cold and had been coughing for more than a year. He had a reduced appetite, was weak and had night sweats, and had blood in his phlegm. He had been treated in many ways without any effect, so he sought treatment from me. After X-ray examination, a cavity the size of a silver dollar was found in the right lung, which was indeed a very critical condition. He was prescribed "Bofei Naer," while also paying attention to health care and resting in peace. After four or five weeks, the disease gradually subsided, and he was completely cured and restored to his original health.</p>

<p>The stomach is located in the center of the abdomen and is the general hub of the body's digestive function. However, stomach diseases often arise due to our irregular diet, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, unbearable stomach pain, and even internal ulcers, which can become dangerous conditions. At this time, you must take "Qiangwei Jing" to be effective, because Qiangwei Jing can promote appetite, supplement nutrition, and can quickly cure all stomach diseases, pale complexion, anemia, constipation, etc. "Qiangwei Jing" is available at the Western medicine departments of Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun Department Stores</p>

<p>In the 57th year of Qianlong, Jia Yonggong Fukang'an was appointed as general, and Chaoyonggong Hailancha was the assistant. Elite troops of the Solon were dispatched to quell the rebellion. The general arrived in Tibet from Qinghai. The Gurkha bandits in Nie La Mu had already been defeated by the team leader. In April, the army arrived at Dingri and went straight to the iron chain bridge, eighty li away in Ji Long. The bandits cut off the bridge and guarded it. Fukang'an confronted them with the main force, while Hailancha secretly used bamboo and wood from the upstream to make rafts to cross the river, bypassed the mountain, and emerged above the bandit camp. Fukang'an took the opportunity to build a bridge and seize the pass, jointly attacking the bandit camp and pursuing them for 160 li. On June 9th, they reached Mount Yongya. The Gurkha chieftains were terrified and sent envoys to the army to beg for surrender. The general and his assistants sternly rebuked them. After several days without a reply, they advanced in three routes, winning six battles and crossing two mountains. They beheaded and captured 4,000 bandits and traveled more than 700 li, approaching their capital. Coincidentally, Bengal, India, Nepal's southern neighbor, also sent troops to attack its border. Nepal was deeply afraid of being attacked from both sides and sent envoys to the army again to beg for surrender, returning what they had plundered and offering tribute, including domesticated elephants, Tibetan horses, and musicians, and submitted a memorial of allegiance. Therefore, they were allowed to be annexed and pay tribute every five years. Nepal is mostly mountainous, with deep valleys and treacherous terrain that is easy to defend. The people wear colorful clothes and paint their foreheads, similar to the tribes of India. Their complexion is not very dark. Their customs value Buddhism, and red and yellow lamas are everywhere, but they cannot wield great power, which is slightly different from Tibet.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Can Humans Eat Grass? <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Herbal Name</p>
<p>Grass roots and tree bark are only fought over in years of famine. In normal times, they are discarded like worn-out shoes, never worth a glance. But in reality, grass roots and tree bark contain extremely rich nutrients. Don't many animals live by eating wild grass and leaves? Their only shortcoming is that the fiber is too coarse and hard, which our delicate stomachs can't handle. Scientists, aware of this, have long been trying to remedy it. Recently, I heard that research in this area has been successful, and wild grass and leaves will appear on our tables. This should be a sensational good news in these days of difficult living and expensive food!</p>
<p>Professor Blair of Hehai University in the United States analyzed 15 kinds of roadside weeds and found that they all contain a large amount of vitamin C. The most abundant one is called milkweed, whose content exceeds spinach, the top-ranking vegetable, by as much as eight times. Other plants such as pokeweed, dandelion, watercress, sorrel, and gladiolus also have amazing figures. Moreover, several chemists in Kansas City, USA, including Gower, have also made the same discovery after four years of continuous analysis and experimentation. According to their recent report at the American Chemical Society conference, the leaves of cereal plants contain the richest nutrients, and the vitamin content is simply alarming; except for vitamin D, almost everything else is available; vitamin A is 23 times more than carrots; B1 is 9 times more than green leafy vegetables: B2 is 12 times more than lettuce; C is 14 times more than tomatoes and oranges.</p>
<p>It would be a pity to leave such a nutritious food to be discarded all over the mountains and fields, letting livestock enjoy it alone. Now Gore and others have solved this problem for us. They dry, bleach, and chemically treat the leaves of wheat, barley, oats, etc., and then make them into a white powder with a slight wheat flavor. This grass powder becomes our excellent tonic food. They also tried it themselves. After eating it for a season last winter, their health improved significantly, and small problems such as colds and coughs completely disappeared, with very satisfactory results. There are now three companies in the United States manufacturing this "grass powder," and the estimated cost is only six cents per pound. It is cheap and good, and it is expected that it will become popular without promotion.</p>
<p>It is not impossible to directly eat fresh grass leaves. According to the London magazine "The Listener" last year, an old gentleman in England named Branson tried eating raw grass and achieved unexpected success. He is a retired official who returned to his hometown to engage in animal husbandry, so he had the opportunity to try this strange thing. He picked all kinds of tender grass sprouts and leaves and raw radishes, beet roots, and brown sugar from the fields and ate them together. After getting used to it, he felt that he could not live without it. In the past two years, he has become stronger and stronger in his old age, his spirit has become more vigorous, and his interest in life has increased day by day. An old man of 67 can still run every morning and even ride a bicycle 90 miles at a time without feeling tired. Is it not a miracle?</p>
<p>According to this old gentleman's opinion, eating grass is of greater significance in agricultural economics. If a field is planted with grass, the output can be four or five times greater than planting wheat!</p>

<h3 id="e87">Understanding the Times <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Zhonghao</p>
<p>We have an old saying, "Those who understand the times are outstanding individuals." Some believe this saying contains poison, but I don't think so. If this saying is poisonous, it must be because unscrupulous people have used it as an excuse, and its meaning has been distorted, that it contains poison.</p>
<p>I believe there is nothing wrong with the saying itself.</p>
<p>However, some people therefore regard those who betray the people as outstanding individuals. If outstanding individuals were to act in this way, and if treacherous officials and villains were all outstanding individuals, then I would truly be speechless.</p>
<p>First, what is the meaning of the three words "understand the times"? Seeking advantages through trickery is definitely not understanding the times, betraying conscience and betraying the people is definitely not understanding the times, betraying the country for personal glory is definitely not understanding the times, and surrendering to brutality and dark forces is definitely not understanding the times. People who understand the era and recognize their mission are the people who understand the times, and only they deserve to be called "outstanding individuals."</p>
<p>Whether a person understands the times or is an outstanding individual is not judged by the personal interests they have accumulated. Those who can understand the era, recognize their own responsibilities, and fight against dark forces for the benefit of the greatest number of people are the people who understand the times, and only they are outstanding individuals.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly gave me a redundant warning. "Mr. Bao, be careful, please walk on the wooden planks, there are important footprints on the floor."</p>
<p>Two or three old wooden planks were laid at the main entrance, connecting to an open doorway on the left, covering the footprints below the planks. Hawthorne suddenly stopped at a small brown mat at the doorway, squatted down, and moved the planks aside. Two rows of very obvious muddy footprints of men's leather shoes, and a row of women's high heels, were clearly visible. Ni Jinshou also bent down with Hawthorne to take a closer look.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hawthorne, these footprints are very clear."</p>
<p>"Very clear." Hawthorne followed the footprints, bending down and walking step by step towards the doorway inside, seemingly concentrating, casually responding.</p>
<p>"The set on the west side, which is deeper, was left when entering, and the set on the east side, which is lighter, was left when exiting. However, the women's shoe prints only show entry and no exit, clearly indicating the footprints of the deceased."</p>
<p>"Exactly. The difference in depth between the entry and exit sets of men's shoe prints is not much."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also said, "These two sets of entry and exit are not confused or intersecting."</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly turned around, pointed near the main entrance, and shook his head, "No, aren't there intersecting men's shoe prints over there?"</p>
<p>I turned back to take a closer look. Indeed, there were several men's footprints overlapping inside the doorway, but one row was very deep, and the other was lighter, and the closer they were to the inner doorway, the lighter they became. Therefore, at first glance, it didn't seem like they were overlapping, as if there was only one row.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also said, "Yes, these two overlapping rows are both entry prints. Strange!" (11)</p>

<h3 id="e89">Wartime Postal Censorship <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Dexin</p>
<p>Every day, more than 100,000 letters come in and out of the Liverpool Post Office in England; and this does not include parcels and other postal items. Therefore, the more than two thousand employees of the bureau, including readers, linguists, cryptographers, chemists, and various experts, are busy sorting out a mountain of mail every day and subjecting it to extremely precise inspection: searching for secret reports from spies, removing letters harmful to the country, and confiscating all goods that could be used to aid the enemy.</p>
<p>In peacetime, this kind of mail inspection work does not seem very important, but when war breaks out, it becomes very important. Every belligerent country, not only England, is making every effort to carry out this work meticulously. On various combat fronts or in garrisoned areas, there are also inspectors in the army who specialize in examining soldiers' letters home; any text that involves military secrets is deleted. After the letters have been sent to their respective destinations, the postal branches must have specialist personnel thoroughly and carefully review these letters from other locations before they are sent out. If there are any inappropriate words or sentences, they are blotted out with opaque ink. Even if the letter only contains questions and answers about the weather, it will be blotted out; because the climate has a great influence on aircraft operations. If the letter also talks about troop movements, that will be even more reason to blot it out.</p>
<p>Even the most hidden intelligence from spies cannot escape the sharp eyes of the inspectors. A piece of paper with invisible ink hiding a code, but which looks perfectly ordinary and unrelated, can be detected by them using steam jets or other chemical methods, and then translated by code experts. If cigars, cigarettes, or other items are shipped through, the inspectors will use probes to test them one by one to see if there are any hidden items from spies inside. Letters written in foreign languages are assigned to linguists to be translated and reviewed. Any goods suspected of being sent to the enemy are confiscated. All kinds of luggage, suitcases, etc. must be carefully examined, and even the collars of each piece of clothing must be turned out and checked; only when there are no suspicious signs can they be allowed to be transported. The meticulousness and rigor of this process are evident.</p>
<p>During the last Great War, various countries suffered a lot from German spies, mostly because the postal censorship was not strict enough. Therefore, in this war, they have learned a lesson and are doing everything they can to prevent it. Postal censorship is one of their most important tasks at present.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Chinese Drama in the War of Resistance <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Famous playwright Ma Yanxiang recently stated in a speech: "The progress of Chinese drama in the past two years can exceed ten years of peacetime."</p>
<p>Indeed, since the War of Resistance, the development of Chinese drama is a fact that no one can deny. It is said that in the interior of China today, including larger and mobile troupes, the total number has exceeded one thousand. Among them, 700 troupes are dispatched by the Political Training Department of China to perform in various locations on the front lines, and there are also 200 troupes in Shanxi.</p>
<p>The actors in the troupes are mostly young men and women, many of whom have never experienced the life of drama before. They are simply driven by patriotic enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Today, Chinese drama, along with the progress of the War of Resistance and National Construction, has been liberated from the atmosphere of stubbornness. The constraints of form and etiquette have now been lifted one by one. Actors can also gain greater freedom in their performances; anyone who has been to the interior of China will surely be able to feel this.</p>
<p>We can certainly see the most advanced Chinese dramas in theaters, but in the corners of the streets, in refugee shelters, in teahouses, and in barracks, there are also the most advanced Chinese dramas being performed!</p>
<p>Due to the increasing popularization of Chinese drama, the propaganda effect received from various aspects has exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>However, in order to further develop its strength in the future, there are now two problems that urgently need to be solved. The first is the need to improve technical equipment; the second is the need to greatly increase the content of the plays being performed; especially the latter, because the plays currently being performed mostly have the same structure, and after a long time, the drawback of becoming outdated is inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="e91">After Watching "Sea Love" <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Shunyi</p>
<p>"Sea Love" is a four-act tragedy set in Southeast Asia. After watching it, I talked a lot with my friends, and here are a few points I noted:</p>
<p>In the fourth act, after Sha Lai (Hu Dao) kills his sister Mei Na (Xiao Feng), the director (Hong Mo) arranges for him to laugh and exit the stage. This method is good, but Sha Lai's laughter should continue to the backstage for a considerable amount of time, so that the audience can still hear it, and the so-called "effect" can occur and be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Sha Lai's killing of Mei Na is a "killing" in the sense of "killing to death," or at least a "killing" of considerable severity. During rehearsals, both the playwright and the director had considered this point, so they planned to have Li Xingming (Yan Jun) pick her up and carry her back to the backstage. Or just let her lie on the stage—lying in a corner, until the end of the play. But the former method was abandoned because Xiao Feng's body was quite heavy and it would not be easy to pick her up. The latter method was also abandoned because at this time, Xiao Feng was a Malay girl named Mei Na who had been killed by her brother. How could a dead Mei Na lie on the stage without affecting many other actions on the stage later? Therefore, the director's treatment of this scene during the first performance was: to have the killed Mei Na slowly crawl up by herself and then be helped by Li Xueming and others to walk to the backstage. This method may have been considered for some time, but I only felt that the effect that this climax should have had was completely lost. How could a person who has been killed be asked to stand up and run back? When he picked her up, there could still be many words spoken from Li Xueming's mouth, which would be a "monologue" and also an appeal to Mei Na!</p>
<p>That's all I want to write, and it counts as my viewing experience and my respect to Xiao Feng, Wu Tian, and the members of the Shanghai Drama Troupe.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Fan Pengke Dies Having Fun <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yi</p>
<p>—— Two hundred and forty thousand yuan is given to four friends</p>
<p>The late movie star Fan Pengke was known among his friends for being good at having fun. Even after his death, he maintained his reputation for being a prankster. He told his four friends before his death that he would not forget them in his will. However, the result was that they were not mentioned at all. But Fan Pengke had a brocade pouch, which was marked to be opened sixty days after his death. By that time, his friends had long forgotten about the idea of inheriting his estate. Fan Pengke opened it and found that it was a supplementary will, instructing that each of his four friends should be given 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e93">General Review of Talents from the Five Classes of Fu Liancheng (Part 2) <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>Jing (Painted Face Male Roles): Fu Liancheng Opera School has the most talents in this line, and there have been countless outstanding individuals produced over the years. If we talk about Hou Xirui, Wang Lianpu, Liu Lianrong, Ma Liankun, Qiu Shengrong, etc., they are all top-notch talents. Among the Five Classes, there are Yuan Shihai, Qiu Shirong, Shen Shiqi, and Tan Shiying. Among these four, Shirong specializes in Tongchui (a type of Jing role), and the rest are all Jiazi Hualian (another type of Jing role). Shirong is Qiu Shengrong's younger brother and also the son of the late famous actor Qiu Guixian. His voice is loud and clear, and his singing and recitation are even better than his brother's. He is currently performing in a regular troupe and is very popular. Yuan Shihai, a Jiazi Hualian, completely privately studied from his senior brother Hou Xirui. Shihai is good at all of Hou's masterpieces. However, although Shihai is named with the "Shi" character generation, he is actually from the "Sheng" character generation. He was placed in the Fifth Class because the "Sheng" character generation was full. Because he entered the school early, he graduated early, joined a troupe early, and became popular early. Today, Shihai's position in the Jing line is no less than that of his senior brother who enjoys a great reputation. Tan Shiying is Tan Fuying's younger brother. He is both skilled in civil and military roles and has many strengths. After Shihai graduated, Shiying followed Shihai and became the Fu family's Hualian (Painted Face). He is also currently performing in a regular troupe. Although Shen Shiqi also specializes in Jiazi Hualian, he is proficient in martial arts plays but not good at performing Jiazi roles. Therefore, his acting path is similar to that of a Wu Erhualian (a type of martial arts role).</p>
<p>Chou (Clown Roles): Fu Liancheng has just as many talents in the Chou line as in the Jing line. Among the Five Classes, this line has the most talents. During their time at the school, Zhan Shifu was one of the most popular. Shifu was known for his "Chou Po Xi" (Clown Old Woman Plays). However, the lack of a voice is the biggest drawback for a Chou actor. Therefore, after Shifu graduated, he was not as popular as he was at school. Ai Shiju later surpassed him and became one of the most popular Chou actors in the Fifth Class. Ai Shiju is good at performing humorous clown plays and can also handle short acrobatic routines. His acting path is similar to that of Ma Fulu and is different from Shifu's, but his skills are actually superior to Shifu's. Besides Shiju, Cao Shicai's skills are also not weak. Shicai is the nephew of the famous Chou actor Cao Ergeng (and also the grandson of Cao Xinquan). However, his acting path is different from Ergeng's and is similar to Jia Duocai. In addition, there are also Yan Shixi (son of Wan Zhenfeng) and Luo Shibao (son of Luo Shengong). Their skills are average, only mid-tier talents.</p>
<p>Epilogue: Although the above article is written in a rambling manner, I have probably not left out anyone. Looking at the lineup of the Five Classes of Fu Liancheng, there are the fewest talents in the Wu Sheng (Male Martial Role) line, and the most talents in the Jing (Painted Face Male Roles) and Chou (Clown Roles) lines. Other roles, such as Mao Shilai's Dan (Female Roles) and Yan Shishan's Wu Dan (Female Martial Role), are also outstanding figures. However, although there are many talents in the Chou line, none of them are good at performing Paodai Chou (Clown Roles Wearing Official Robes, i.e., roles like Tang Qin and Jiang Gan). Is Paodai Chou not easy to perform? (Note: When the Five Classes performed Paodai Chou plays during their time at the school, Xiao Shengxuan of the Fourth Class always filled in. Shengxuan is the nephew of the famous Chou actor Xiao Changhua. Changhua was a Chou role teacher at Fu Liancheng and was famous throughout the country for his Paodai Chou plays, but the Fifth Class had no talent in this line, which is truly regrettable.)</p>
