<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際開展的動嚮</h3>
<p>這三個月以來，爲了法日關於越南交涉的趨歸，難以捉摸，於是環繞在這一問題的遠東當前形勢，也就跟着呈現了一種迷離的狀態；更因義大利宣佈實行參戰後，國際陣營究將如何更進一步劃分，亦成疑問，於是大局允多岐途。到了現在，法日間的妥協終於出現了，首先揭曉了所謂越南問題：其决，却也同時破打了遠東當前形勢的迷離，很可能的立即要引出許多具體的發展；而在最近將來，牠將必然地給予在疑問中的國際情勢，以一個肯定而具體的解答。</p>
<p>越南問題是吾跟着協定字而入另一階段，亦不能無疑。據昨日消息，由廣西邊境侵入越南同登這一路的日軍，兩日以來，一直在遭受着法軍的抵抗，繼續在激戰之中；所謂法軍已經屈服，日軍「以友好態度開入越南」云云，據越南當局稱，是「完全無稽」的。那末，越南問題的核心，至今還在未定之天。今後一切，繫之於法屬越南政府與法國駐軍之間，以及與貝當政府之間的關係。就我們記憶所及，不久以前，曾經風傳關於法國整個國策，特別對於應付日本壓迫主張的不同，越南當局曾經有過脫離貝當政府的意向；後來經過了越督的變更，兩方又都强調了所謂「舉國團結」的口號；這其間，當然有微妙的演變。因此，目前的越南軍民如果憤激於屈辱政策的錯誤，毅然拒絕與日本相妥協，而從事於抵抗侵略，形成世界上又一正義火花的迸發，則中美英蘇諸國，應當立刻感覺道義上的責任，把握這千鈞一髮的機運，採取堅決的行動。予越南以最大的援助與合作！</p>
<p>不過，不管越南問題本身怎樣演變，在目前形勢下，未來的遠東形勢，以及整個的國際形勢，經過了幾個月的醞釀，直到前天宣告越南協定的簽字爲止，已經踏上了一個比較確定的方向，這是關心國際的人們所不難洞察的。</p>
<p>蓋就遠東局勢說：法國的失敗主義者，已經明明白白地，宣佈了承認日本製造「東亞新秩序」的立塲。接着，却又由義大利的「權威發言人」，予以公開的贊揚。惟有德國的態度，直到現在評論的時候爲止、還沒有表明。雖我們想象，德義兩國在這樣車大問題上，態度上絕不會彼此背馳，然其間相當的歧異，在所不免。至於歧異的角度，今後究將如何消長，則視日本對德義將依附至如何程度而定。假定完全抗瀣一氣，則日本所抱「將白種人勢力，一舉而逐出亞洲」的意願，殆爲德義軸心所能同予承認。而目前的越南問題，不過其發端而已。針對這一情勢，中美英蘇四國，應如何立即考慮各目的立塲，發爲和諧的行動。這在中國方面，毫無疑義的有其行動的最大自由；在這行動之下，越南如果抵抗日軍，則牠是中國的戰友，可以駢肩作戰；否則，牠也不能影響到中國的行動。至於英美兩國，在這事件上，立場是完全一致的。牠們在亞洲利益，已根本受到了威脅，同時牠們也完全消失了防日本成為德義同盟的顧忌。假定很順遂的開展、則牠們唯一的原則，便是合作。合作原則之下的具體行動，將不外是：第一步，切實的對日本施用壓力，例如施行禁運等等。如果無效，則具第二步應用盡一切力注，正面去制止日本。最有效的制止，第一便是加緊　助中國：其次便是英美海軍立刻在遠東動員起來，以行動來糾正現實。例如目前傳說着的重行開放滇緬公路，以及美國得利用新加坡軍港等等，將皆是必然的事。至於蘇聯，雖然較中美英三國為間接，可是昨今所表現的東方新情勢，蘇聯當然不能漠然無動於中，而今後的援助中國抗戰，自以更』強調為結論。</p>

<p>東京　日軍公報宜稱、日軍入越邊同登時、遭遇抵抗、日軍乃佔據該地附近半永久性之防禦工程、俘法軍一百四十人、內有軍官數員、法方死一百三十人、並爲日軍奪獲過山砲兩尊、迫擊砲一尊重機關槍二挺、來福槍二百枝、日軍損失甚微、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　日半官方面宣稱、據此間所接消息、昨日同登發生衝突之結果、日軍傷亡共的百名、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>華方開緊急會議　損失唯法國是問</h3>
<p>重慶　國民政府昨因日軍在越南之行動、開緊急會議、討論大局、今日續開會議、其決議未經發表、惟聞中國如因法日協定受有損失、當向法政府是問、外交部昨向法大使館提出抗議、重行聲明中國有權取自衛計畫、任何損失、須由法政府負責、日軍攻入越南消息傳來後、此間至普通之評論、謂日軍攻越、如爲解決中國事件、則日軍已誤取方向矣、蓋日軍不取道越南向中國邊界進發、而目前由桂邊南下以入越也、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　中央日報今晨社論、促英國立卽開放緬旬路綫、予中國以運輸軍需充分之援助、並謂美國雖屢作警吿、而日軍仍攻入越南、此當視爲日本故意觸犯美國、日本顯欲在美國完成兩洋海軍建造程序以前、先發制人該報又籲請德國勿爲日本利用、而任其自私開拓政策、同時並不以有力之援助予德、如列强今不卽取決斷之行動、則太平洋大局必將江河日下、不可收拾、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間有識者對於法日之越南協定、多抱一種見解、以爲日本侵人越南、目的不在對華、但爲其南進政策之重要步驟、而以越南爲將來進攻荷屬東印度與新加坡之起點是、華人現竚待央美等對於日本此舉之反響、華人各界咸信美國將對日本加緊其經濟報復、而英國亦將予中國以更大之援助、以期得中國合作、共謀阻遏日本之南進、是以華人現抱有緬甸公路行將復通、庶美國可沿此　運入各種供應品以加強中國抗戰之希望、蓋若中國潰敗、則日本將可自由進行其南進政策也、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　中國外交部已就法日簽訂越南協定一事、向法國當局提出抗議、鄭　指出中國保有採取防禦措施之樺利、幷申明此項協定所將引起之結果、法國政府應負全責、（二十四日海通社電）於此層、其自然、趨勢、必係接　英國所予使用新加坡之强大軍港、（二十四日合衆）</p>
<p>華盛頓　日本侵人越南、已引起美國採取新經濟計畫以限制日本之可能性、據橫威方面消息，新限制辦法將包括加　統制汽油廢鐵與其他物品之對日輪出、日方雖聲明尊重越南土地完整與法國主權、惟美國官塲認日本侵越、乃對美國遠東利益之嚴重威脅、（廿四日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨稱、越南時局中之事態轉變甚速、莫可得遂時發展之明白眞相、惟越南現狀似被推翻而此推翻現狀之事、係在武力下成就者、美國已屢决聲明其譴責此種行逕之地位，（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　引用法外長鮑陀音之語、稱美對日與越南當局成立之妥協、已獲美國贊同、此决維希消息、已爲美國務院加以嚴厲吾認、公吿稱、「美政府對越南法當局對日之讓步、迄未加以贊同」、國務卿赫爾最初卽宜吿不同意於日本之侵略越南，赫爾稱、「現狀爲恫嚇所亂、事已顯然矣、（二十四日國際社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間政界人士暗示、美國或將超越外交抗議之外、以表示其反對日本在越南之行動、據向稱肖息靈通方面之預料、美國對於比項挑戰、將不致放午而不予答復、美政府官員對英國在歐之抵抗既日增信任、故對美國在穩定太平洋現狀中可作更稍極參加之信念、亦爲之提高、據軍界人士官稱、英國現正考慮派遺援軍革新加坡、非官塲方面意見、美國表示反對之方法、或有下列各項可能性、（一）召駐日大使格魯回國商議、（二）完全禁止汽油廢鐵及其他供給品之輸出、（三）增加對荷印軍需品之接濟、美國務卿赫爾譴責日本在越南行動之言論、今日各報均以大字登載、赫氏之言曰、越南現狀之被擾亂、似頗顯然、此舉係乘法國困難之際而成就美國反對此項方法之立塲、已屬有聲明矣、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日報作強硬論調　不容第三國干預</h3>
<p>東京　日本報紙今日聲稱、任何國家「胆敢」預日本在越南之「神聖使命、」必將遭受毀滅、「讀賣新聞」載稱、日本政府對於仟何第三國抗議日小之進犯越南、將毫不遲疑的加以拒絕、該報謂、日本在越南之意嚮、「乃極爲和平及富建設性者、目已獲得法國政府之充分諒斛」、　下第三國於開始卽干預法日之談判、現已顯露其對日本之「恫嚇態度」、「東京日新聞」謂、法日之越南協定應作爲「建立東亞互助繁榮」之用、並可促成「中國事件」之解決、該報稱、「倘或仟何外國肌敢干預此神聖之使命、則日本應將其毀滅、」（二十四日台衆社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（十）（三）　希特勒私生活片段</h3>
<p>希特勒的私生活，不但沒有人知道，而且也不會有人知道。他所住的貝許德斯加登山間別墅「鷹巢」，除了少數幾個親信之外，別人無從問津。即使有資格在那里作客，也受「來賓須知」的的束，不得把希特勒私邸中情况，或把他們領袖的生活起居，向外洩漏半字，否則便耍受嚴厲的處罰。然而事有湊巧，希特勒別墅中有一個叫做寳琳，柯勒Pauline　Kohler的女侍，（年二十三歲，身材苗條，很有幾分姿色），她的父母和年靑的丈夫曾先後被秘密警察拘捕，她悲憤之餘，不免開罪當道，也遭逮捕送入集中營。一九三四年釋放之後，在一個國社黨官吏的家中做女侍，因爲成績優良，三年之後，主人把他保舉到希特勒別墅中服役，從此這位獨裁者的私生活，就逃不出寳琳的隻眼，而且她從其他接近希特勒者的口中，獲悉許多軼事。一九三九年春，她想盡方法纔脫離了「禁宮」，和她的丈夫歷盡千辛萬苦，逃出德國，輾轉山歐洲前往美國。於是希特勒富有神秘性的私生活，從這身歷其境的美貌女侍洩露於世了。寳琳的著述，最初絡續載於美國「自由」週報，現已印成單行本，茲節譯如下，以供讀者一粲：</p>
<p>希特勒雖是個蔬食主義者，然而食不厭精，一切非常考究。要是烹飪方面稍有差失，總管奧杜，舍利朋便耍惶恐失、色了。廚房裹共有四個庖丁，都來自柏林著名菜館。並有一個馳譽歐洲的蔬食專家，匈牙利人羅迪。范猶，做他們的監督。他是希特勒別墅中僅有的一個外國人，現在已入德國籍，待遇非常優厚。</p>
<p>希特勒起身甚遲，不到十點鍊不吃早飯，有時要弄到十一點鐘。早膳吃得很少，一杯鮮橘汁，幾片塗牛油的麵包而已。他很喜歡牛油，每天總要吃上半磅，貝許德斯加登的農家每天總得供給着這新鮮的牛油。</p>
<p>他午餐的胃口極好，對第一道的蔬菜湯總要吃上許多。其决是魚，希特勒並不完全吃素，不過不吃肉罷了。他對於澆牛油沙示的鱒魚，吃之不厭。魚盤裏還要放些炸山芋。吃罷魚，侍者便捧上一大盤雜色的硬殼菓，惟有這種東西是他親自剝來吃的。</p>
<p>他對各種酒概不沾脣，不過有時也飲些「充啤酒」，比了普通啤酒要淡得多。與眞啤酒相同的，只不過顏色而已。他歡喜喝咖啡，煮得極濃，而且極甜。二八總要灌上十六大杯呢。</p>
<p>晚膳至少有六道菜，在白晝祗有客人是這樣吃的。希特勒所吃不多，祗不過生菜，山芋，和最歡喜的甜食。在他微賤之時，每天下午，常到柏林的凱漱夫或阿特侖旅館中大吃其奶油甜點。一星期的菜單中，至少有四天列着這種甜食。</p>
<p>客人共膳時得以自由進酒，但這種酒必須限於德國產。戈林對於這一點最爲頭痛，因爲他家有個極講究的酒窟，裹面藏着許多法蘭西和義大利的美酒呢。</p>
<p>在希特勒之前吸烟，甚革於在他所要到的房間中吸烟，那是絕對不可的。他對於烟氣味最爲痛恨。他的愛吃糖食，好像普通人的吃烟，每星期總要吃好幾磅。一次，我（寳琳自稱）聽見他對戈林說，「這些糖食很能增進我辦事能力呢」</p>
<p>講到穿衣服，希特勒可算是世界上最不講究衣着的一個人。然而他倒有一個名叫愛特格羅士的私人裁縫。他因爲不願意給裁縫好好的量身村，衣服總是弄得不配身。以德國的最高領袖而言，他可說是世界上衣服最少的一人了。他全部的衣着，祇有幾套制服，五套常服，和兩套夜禮服。但這僅僅的幾套衣服，在他的侍從看來，還很覺麻煩。</p>
<p>他的常服中只有玄色和深灰兩種顏色。他穿在身上毫不留心。有時候任意蜷在椅子中，不到一兩個鐘頭，那褲子的膝蓋一段，便膨脹得像燈籠一般了。還有他衣服的口袋裹常塞滿了糖菓和許多紙張。總之裁縫司務做得好好的衣服，一穿到他的身上，保證在數天之內就要走樣的。</p>
<p>事實上，他以爲一個男人講究衣着是沒有出息的。戈林專歡喜搜羅制服，常受他的奚落。希特勒對於褐衫，短褲，長統靴的衝鋒隊制服，感覺得十分的舒服和愛好。</p>
<p>希特勒父失眠症的纏擾，久而未愈。不但上午十時以前不能起身，而且非到午膳之後</p>
<p>作者寶琳柯勒女士決不做事。卽使到了下午，也先要接見政界要人，或與朋友們談商一切。直要等到八時半吃過夜飯，纔坐在寫字台後開始工作。</p>
<p>工作的第一步，他先瀏覽世界各國報紙的提要。這種提要係由十幾個精通各國文字的報紙秘書編譯而成。外界有些人說，希特勒所看的報紙材料，先耍經過里賓脫洛甫或郭倍爾諸人的檢閱選擇，然後進呈，這是不確的。不過這一批報紙秘書自有他們的權衡，或刪或存，都先經過一層考量，也無非是「火燭小心」之意罷了。你想，報紙上如有譏諷這德國元首的地方，難道希特勒願意自己打自己耳光麼；他看到了英美報紙上的漫畫或諷刺詩文，立刻就要把火冒到十丈高。尤其是英國漫書家雜（Low）的作品，最容易使他動怒。</p>
<p>他看完了報紙摘耍之後，就喊他的常隨秘書們入室，這班秘書是分班工作的，開始辦稿。他口授言詞，由他們筆錄下來。講得非常之快，而且高聲叫喊，好像正對大衆演說一般。他所用的語句文法，往往十分的不高明，在沒有謄正發出之前，必須要經過很緻細的修削潤色。這樣的口授機要，草擬公文，給全國各地方的官吏，其所費時間的有一小時半。</p>
<p>但是關於希特勒的身體情狀，我却從他的男侍弗萊士·拉勃爾，和副管家愛爾薩·何士芬口中探得二。至於他們呢，却是從希特勒的姊姊寳拉·希特勒那裏所聽來得。據說希特勒的心臟很叫入擔心，而他的咽喉又有癌樣的徵象。</p>
<p>饒柏勒敎授初决開刀時，曾在他的右聲帶上割去一個瘤。第一第二决是吾連續着執行，那可不得而知。希特勒發音的困難，並不由於演說决數過多而起，據何士芬對我所說的，倒是信而有徵的呢。她說　要除去痛腫的聲帶，祇有把聲帶割掉，於是從元首自己的皮膚上切下）條假的聲帶，把它接種在咽喉之中。現在希特勒喉中癌的危險已經過去了。饒柏勒敎授的開刀，挽救了他的聲音，不過　後希特勒的聲音，勢必愈弄愈粗沙。我父知道饒柏勒敎授曾推薦爲溫莎公奏刀過的維也納外科專家牛門敎授，但是希特勒因爲他是猶太人的緣故加以拒絕了。（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花　紗價上漲之說素</h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>二十支雙馬紗在千元關內外進出、爲時已有二個月之久、近日市塲漲風復見、且大家認爲多頭機會又來、所以自九一八以後之市面、可說一經向上檔而盤旋、昨今兩日、漲勢較盛、買氣異常熱烈、茲將其因素簡述如左、</p>
<p>（一）迴旋已久之香港幫秋銷起色、辦去粗細紗將近萬包、且卽刻裝運、由此檯面上籌碼稍覺乾枯、投機商乘機拉提、因之買來賣去之輸贏成交、由二千增至三千以外、可想投機心想複熾之一斑、</p>
<p>（二）近來外匯已入寗靜之途、黃金變化亦鮮、一般銀號附設之紗花部、專門代客一包或五包十包交易、小公司猶如雨後春筍、數量雖微、集併計算、殊屬可觀、此公司開幕後、人塲大都買進者爲多、賣出者爲少、如斯籌碼亦被吸去一批、又屬利多、</p>
<p>（三）日紗市塲沂被統制、每日每市之起伏範圍殊狹、投機者旣乏手腕、又少興趣、大數改變宗旨、換換口味、羣向變馬市塲進攻、所以近來幾天、樓下華紗市塲、人頭壅塞、無揷足之地、一片興旺氣象也、又有人說以上之投機商、皆無久擺之計劃、抱搶帽子派用塲主義爲第一也、</p>
<p>（四）上之情形、皆屬利多、不過有一部份觀察、目前商業狀况較昔進步、港幫納胃允强、市面固屬看好、然比之一週前、雙馬紗已漲起一百元、在此各路交通阻碍重重之際、除港幫市面通達裝運、且所辦之紗皆係指定牌子、粗紗居多、他如浙東方面、依然貨運艱難、二則外匯旣平、反有趨鬆放長之象、越南問題、時緊時她、加之滬埠存紗仍有大量之數、在三十萬包之外、一旦反動變遷、亦不可不防也、所以某銀行之雙馬、已大量出籠矣、（山）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>紗價自因棉紗海運閉塞而回跌之後、常在千元左右盤旋、旅進旅退、不過幾元上落、又往往隨金市而忽高忽低、至昨日（廿四）上午開市後、突步步高陞、從一千零十五元（雙馬廠單）而一千零廿八元、一千零三十八元、一千零四十元收盤、據查步漲原因、（一）係港粵幫靜極而動、實銷旺盛、（？）（二）係中外棉進入租界、須經某方簽證允許方可之說、（三）係日紗廠减工空氣甚盛、有某某等廠　經實現之說、如是則棉紗生產量减少、而外棧棉紗存底亦將因實銷發動而遂漸减少、（四）爲英商紗廠出品有全部作爲軍裝原料之說、（五）爲西南各省內地紗價、每件已漲至四千元外（？）擁有游資的投機家、認爲紗價低小至千元左右、已是低盤（？）此後必將邁步而直上靑雲、於是紗價在上述五種的空氣籠罩之下、做多者買進心思、愈益濃厚、因之紗價叉扶搖直上矣、但是無論如何、必須看海運的能吾暢通及實銷的能吾畏久的大量動辦爲轉移、吾則紗價前途、仍必榮少辱多也、（龍駒生）</p>
<h3>投機播放空氣　棉紗直上　雙馬抬至一千零卅二元</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、且漲風稍起、此因香港帮對於親貨銷路接踵、而同時投機者播放空氣、皆屬利多、謂洋商股票大漲、於是推波助瀾、互相購買、一時檯面上籌碼較感缺乏、抬力允足、市盤乃逐步上升、一般說者越南問題、亦屬利於買方，所以投機買風益熾矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣尚和善、二十支雙馬價爲一千〇十四元、微跌至十元、旋投機者及搶帽子之輩、一致拖進、雖美滙趨鬆、金價下跌、然塲中依然買多而賣少、直漲至一千〇二十八九元、市上又有傳說、照綫路上觀測、又屬利多、買戶仍見踴躍、同時聞廣帮有一千六百包交易、同行投機成交有三千包以外、收盤價爲一千〇三十二元、以後續升幾元、查半日間成交統計四千五百〇五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十五元半、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行三、三三〇香港一、六五〇統計四、五〇五</p>
<h3>新棉來路阻止</h3>
<p>現棉交易、尚屬平凡、惟人心看穩，此因新棉來路阻止、然廠方吃胃尚滯也、</p>
<p>二六二·〇〇</p>
<p>巴西棉二六五·〇〇同行進四〇〇件</p>
<p>二七〇·〇〇</p>
<p>白洛去二一五·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因投機者之賣出而略跌、終因同業之購買、及一部份因華爾街股票市價之上漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲七八磅音、印度市况亦殊活躍、昨日連同預測竟漲四羅比之巨、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來叉轉形活躍、允以長纖維者爲最、奈因此項原棉市上奇缺、且海外裝船及付款困難、加以近日廠方需要稍增、故日來該項原棉頗爲俏俐、據同業觀察、棉價將有續漲之望也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布為紗帶起</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市趨勢益堅、乃以紗價漲風仍銳、廠方素價步增、蘇北及山東幫現需續盛、色布綫呢及重磅粗布價均上漲、每疋二角半至五角、坏布及細布斜紋漲每疋二角半、本街成交各貨七百餘件、烟台·靑島·泰皇島帮辦重磅粗布三百餘包、蘇北各路及南京幫辦色布色斜絨布等一萬餘疋、粵港幫辦粗布色布斜紋等二百餘件、浙閩幫交易稍稀、</p>
<p>東布　白貨中檔細布及細斜、因本　實銷續旺、成交　一千件左右、市氣頓緊、又漲每疋五六角、龍頭細布續漲五角、下午收盤爲三十三元四角、　嘰天津幫採辦三百餘箱、提升每碼二分外、收盤爲九角五分三七五、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭昨日有二千五百件、運往烟台、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯寗靜</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌仍平、英美匯暗市、趨勢　靜、因經營者仍待越南方面戰事之發展、是以當日情形沉悶、結果收盤、美金平定、仍爲五元三一二五、英略硬化、計〇一五六二五、爲三辦士半、乃港電續有吐出之故、</p>
<p>港電續來拋塞</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近漲〇六二五，遠升一二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美對滬均平、美對英未更、對滬縮二分，中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四八四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、較之前收、均無榮辱開後雖投機商稍扒、但外行頗肯供給、市勢缺乏變化、計做開九月份美匯五元三一二五、滙豐掛脾揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉升〇·二五、此後港電前來拋塞、然外行尚樂於吸收、市况仍吿平穩、計港電售予滙豐有利某行等現貨英金三辦士四八四三七五及半辦士、並有本月份美匯五元三一二五、迨十一時光景、因有法日衝突之說、及港電續來吐售、斯時市勢微現鬆硬、計港電售予滙豐現貨美匯五兀三四三七五、同時現先令三辦士半進出、午刻買賣均稀、爲狀呆平、收盤英金三辦士半、美匯五元三一二五、</p>
<p>英長美無榮辱</p>
<p>後市交易平淡、潛勢鬆平、　港電吐予外行現貨英金三辦士半、不久投機商想拋出十月期美滙五元三一二五、但外行則無吃胃，迄收盤英金三辦士半、美滙五元三一二五、十月期英金三辦士四八四三七五美匯五元二八一二五、結果比上日英均硬〇一五六二五、美則不分榮辱、</p>
<p>香港匯市無變</p>
<p>香港一十四日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤英呈　盪、美告平定、各滬行情概無榮辱、十一時三十分及下午二時三十分開盤、均吿平平、各匯仍無上落、</p>
<p>天津英美俱長</p>
<p>天津二十四日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤告鬆、英美匯現貨各長〇三一二五、英匯爲三便士三七五、美匯爲五元〇九三七五、申匯回　二角五分、爲一百〇四元、「聯鈔」暗盤續昂七角五分、爲九十元〇　角五分，</p>
<h3>浮多出籠　金價挫落</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、跌易漲難、雖越南當局對日屈服、准許日軍假道、但因盛傳法日又起衝突、及報載英美將有聯合對日之動作、多頭心思、猶豫不前、反使一般浮戶出籠、價乃挫落、農初略形平疲、首由銀號出錢兌業二十兩、爲六千二百十元、比隔昨做小十三元、嗣經銀號帮及錢兌業吸收、會升達六千二百三十五元、旋另一錢兌業與金號帮沽出、復退入六千二百二十元關內、但此後買賣靜寂、一度盤旋於六千二百二十元內外、迨十一時光景、膏風陡濃、肉傳法日衝突、日期時匯市硬化、銀號錢兌業爭先力售、立慘入六千二百元大關、金號出銀號十兩、遜爲六千一百八十五元、午刻賣者轉少、市勢吿穩、銀號帮及浮空抵補、迨收市已回至六千二百零三元、午後開市頗佳、錢兌業抬價吸收下拉起十餘元、進銀號十兩、爲六千二百二十元、俄頃某證券帮力賣、錢兌業亦反進爲出、立跌至六千二百元、不意斯時某證券帮忽止塞力扒、遂叉漲至六千二百十元、卒因散多斬結、及銀號帮出多於進、故結果僅有六千二百兀收盤、比上日續跌二十三兀、全天五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數兀、牧進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、仍無變更、大同行依然懸六百四十元原價、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　內債昂漲　外股仍有維持</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日趨勢更見　强、人氣之激昂、進胃之濃厚、得未曾有、各幫投資興趣、漸見踴躍、貼水之日見其小、卽其鐵證、市上頭寸之鬆濫、游資之無歸宿、乃以吸收公債爲惟一之出路、因其旣有很高之利息、復有意外中籤之利潤、故市上新戶買進者日有增加、昨日經過、上午初開略疲、入後聯和鴻大永康聯興等吸收甚湧、市價漸轉上騰、同康稍有出籠、仁昌中一信昌等亦有賣出、午收微好一二角、午後恒孚進胃較鉅、廣收甲丙戊三種、一時做多者絡繹不絕、久孚同順樂茂聯和鴻大永康紛紛收進、多數爲同康供給、少數爲聯益潤利利昌等所賣、市氣極圭、甲種又逼近五元、乙種已穿出八元、丁種市價比較最賤、亦見五十四元七角行市、交易逐見興旺、市價結果續漲五角半至七角、成交總數的共一百六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股一百股、價爲二十四元二角半、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市開盤之堅、有過於一般人意料、但越南法日新衝突之消息傳來、獲利了結之風突又加劇、終使此種堅勢、不克久持、價格在傾跌時、維持之佳、不容否認、　决漲風中、多頭方面、顯有一種逾量頭寸，此等股票在不得已時、當然需要「軋直」、但設消肩方面、能有順利發展、依目下本埠銀根鬆弛情形　觀、市况繼續看高、無疑的亦非難事、</p>
<p>倫敦二十三日（週二）電今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、祇古拉客林傍橡皮股獨跌七便士半、價爲十三先令九便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>糧食　越南事件雖嚴重　未能使米市興奮</h3>
<p>—洋米到源不絕粳米存貨不薄—</p>
<p>洋米昨日早市、再被投機囤戶所操縱、蓋越南問題之發展、足以爲抬價之藉口、且謂連日天雨新米到少、市價之喊高好似振振有詞、故早市各洋米一　拉起七八角至近元、繼因越南雖見混沌、而來源並不中斷所謂越南事件者、乃與米價不相涉、而實際旣有平糶與新尖軋脚、反見淸淡、加之長江客秈源源抵埠、因此中市以後、卽有浮戶出籠之抑價、市價反致猛瀉一元半、結果反比前日收市小六七角、英華司二號西實連兵險初開七十七元二角、繼爲七十七元、亦比前日暗削半元、成交一百多噸、現米的七八千包、一號陳西貢開六十九元、火絞六十八元、二號西貢六十四元半、六十四兀、二號暹羅六十三元半、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、到貨雖阻、然存底不弱、實銷較洋米似有問津、所以市無榮辱、價盤與前市相仿、高自常粳七十九元、决至蘇崑粳七十七元、糯米高自溧元七十元、决至丹元六十八九元、香港貨高决悉同、不過薄稻及早晚稻僅賴脚踏車運來一些、致造成供求不勻之局面、物稀爲貴、行情遂獨飛漲二元、聞開靑角薄稻竟達八十二元、南港早稻原包七十九元、斛見七十六元半七十六元、</p>
<p>新貨來源略疎、昨由水陸兩路運到、計的粳尖千來包、去路尚佳、形成定格、顓橋新粳開原包七十五元、太會嘉定羊尖原包六十七元、斛見六十五元半、六十五元、獨杜尖缺貨見漲元砠、開斛見六十四元半、六十四元云云、</p>
<p>洋米來滬湧旺、連日到滬迭誌本報、昨日又有悄和　行裕生輪自香港運來一萬一千七百二十六包、德生輪亦由香港裝來二千一百五十包、兩輪均停羅斯福碼頭、今日可起卸完竣、太古公司湖北輪、昨晨到埠、亦自杳港運來四百二上六包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>麵粉北運　以易北貨</h3>
<p>麪粉昨已穩定、蓋自最近　連漲兩次後、已達十六元五角之價、且各貨零售價格以現貨缺乏、每包有售十七元五角、頗引起各界人士所注意、據粉商談及、因日方限制北方貨運、惟糧食不在其列、然爲盛行以貨易貨、故欲採辦北方貨物，不得不覓交換之品、而以麵粉爲最合北銷、故大都北運以粉易貨、而華廠生產有限、當然不敷供應、聞客盤竟有十九元之價、但未聞確切之成交、刻當局已佈吿嚴懲居奇操縱米粉市價、而廠商已表示暫不再加、但迄未能儘量應付本街實銷爲憾、洋粉內地粉交易俱靜、阜豐廠出品之四號粉紅桃花對於本街尚有输出、售價亦已漲至十五元叫五角云、</p>
<p>小麥昨日交易、因華廠已有洋麥新到、及租界供應困難、故進胃暫時頗爲呆懈、日廠抑價嚴厲、售手頗不樂從結果價仍平穩、聞市上做開之崑山太倉麥一百餘包、價仍爲二十四元六角半、其餘各貨、業已喊高、致未妥交、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油貨主扳售　生油市面較疲</h3>
<p>昨日晨初生豆油遠期及現貨市面、一致挺升五角至一元、良由操縱者之償技、投機附庸之環境、惟生油在上午收盤時、人心始呈軟勢、革午後賣氣轉盛、且傳靑島市報小、致遠期油市不穩、再行下挫、至豆油情形、銷塲雖懈淡、然貨戶不願賤脫、故潛勢仍堅、昨日行情比前市續升一元至一元半、計成交膠州豆油一百五十件、價爲七十四元至七十四元五角、烟岐豆油五十件、價爲七十四元至七十四元五角、烟岐豆油五十件、價爲七十六元、大有餘廠豆油五百担、價爲八十二元至八十三元、生油做開靑島油二百五十桶、價爲九十六元五角、路貨爲九十五元七角、跌至九十五元、膠州油五百件、價爲六十九元半至六十九元、路貨爲六十九元至六十八元半、訂十月上交二百五十件、價爲六十九元至六十八元半、十月下交一百件、價爲七十元零五角、跌至六十九元七角半云、</p>
<p>又雜糧中之芝蔴、昨有三百包運　香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　晶明冰一百元</h3>
<p>昨糖市稍有上洛、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗日本棧八十元半、外棧貨同價、升半元、轉口貨六十四元、不動、荷棉日K嘜七D十六元、荷赤現貨六十三元一角、小二角、路貨六十二元半、太古車白微鬆、B嘜七十七元二角、小三角、DY及HX嘜均七十五元三角、小一二角、本廠一號冰九十八元半、晶明冰一百元、均升一元半、號貨開出雜路靑二白包、六十八元半、又本廠冰花靑開六百餘包、七十四元半、又糖昨由香港來四百五十包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球暫加四元</h3>
<p>—每担七兀二角—</p>
<p>煤球行情，各廠又借越南事件、昨經集議、廠盤暫加四元、計開南洋義秦興國華煤球、同業自車、每噸一百三十二元、送到另加車力、本街門莊、每担七元二角、送到客戶每噸一百四十四元正、</p>

<h3>婚后男子衛生的重要</h3>
<p>『知足常樂」這一句名言，是對準備着当今社会的『人慾　流』而说的。本来人们的慾望好像汪洋大海裏的水，是無窮盡的。在好的一方面說：人類所以有千百萬年的歷史和社會繼續不斷的進步，是完全由於慾望無止境的推動，要是人們無慾望，個個都　靜無為，那世界上的一種熱力就要冷淡下來，社會上的進化也就要停滯起來，這將成為什麽樣子？可是人慾過於橫流，那可以朝秦而暮楚，得籠更望蜀，然結果仍不滿足，因此，人類的憂怨，痛苦與悲慘也就隨之而來，並且也像汪洋大海一樣無所窮盡！</p>
<p>一個結婚年齡的青年？慾望是最旺盛的時候，在一般慾望中尤其以性慾爲最。因爲性慾是天賦的本能，與生俱來至成年最盛，這時的性慾猶一匹駿馬，你能駕御得法，那牠就可以完全為你所用，對你有莫大的幫助，要是不得駕御之法，一旦放縱，你就無法控制而有隨馬傷及生命之虞，但你如果一直把他關在廐裏，不使行動，過於違背了牠的天性就有病死的危險，這豈不太可惜！</p>
<p>由此我們知道一個男子於結婚之後，實是一個很危險的關頭，有着多少年輕丈夫，他的腦力驟然退减了，呈記憶不良，思想枯澀，時有腦脹頭痛，耳鳴眼花等病象，同時在性機能方面，也呈急遽的衰弱現象，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精力渙散等症，但婚後的妻子，因爲女性生理的不同，她的性慾每格外高漲，夫婦生活即不能協調，我</p>
<p>遺精的後患和特效療法</p>
<p>性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>知好色，則慕少艾」。人之情也。情是性的表現，性是情的基礎。青年人因為性機能生理的成熟，在內部的心性間受荷　爾蒙的刺激，常有強烈的壓迫。此種壓迫如果意志稍為薄弱一點的青年，就很難克制，不由自主地用物以玩弄陽部，以解決一時的難耐。要知道此種卑恥的行為一開始，即很難矯正，所以手淫極易養成惡癖，惡癖稍久，性神經受其摧殘卽有衰弱或過敏狀態，是以遺精繼起。</p>
<p>遺精是青年人身體健康的漏　。有了這個漏　，健康的水準就一天天的低落，如果他原來是一個健康而活潑的青年，一患了遺精，那面部就日漸的萎黃而枯瘦了，腦力也日漸的衰退了，感覺記憶不良，時有頭腦脹痛，耳鳴眼花，甚至不能讀書，不能思想，如舟一操勞，更有腰酸背痛，肢體疲備，精神勞倦不堪，在性機能上，並將爆發腎虧無能，發育不全，精薄不育等症，此種男子將如何能在清場逐鹿，為異性之歡，享人生應有的幸福，且亦不能在社會上與人競爭，得一謀生之路，因此失戀與失業，雙重痛苦交迫，茫茫前途，大有無限隱憂！唯一補救辦法，即必須先行戒絕手淫，同時服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」，則必柯鞏固精關，根治遺洩。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可早日完全恢復健康，并可收延年益壽之效。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等最新科學療法，更可保證治療。們試想正當柔情蜜意，美目凝盼的居下位者有所期待，可是丈夫所給予的祇是空洞，虛幻欺騙與無能，這怎能不使她悵然失望地惱恨？所以很有許多夫婦因性生活的不得滿足，致演出家庭間之種種悲劇！</p>
<p>婚後男子所以致病的原因，均爲昧於兩性衛生的緣故，如果男子能於婚前保守童貞，沒有自凟與遺糖，於婚後亦不荒淫縱慾，能常保其精力之充沛，則不特因性能之健康，可以永享夫婦之愛，度着幸福的生活，並在學術與事業的前途，能以倍人的精力以赴，也必是鵬程萬里，未可限量！比之上述婚後衰弱男子的痛苦，豈不猶是天堂與地獄？上述男子的唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均公認服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症而特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述病症完全治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效允速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯是女性幸福之鐘</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>幸福本非命安排，</p>
<p>健美兩字最堪誇，</p>
<p>倘然雙乳萎　甚；</p>
<p>名藥補救快學乖。</p>
<p>經過不少醫師的指導，許多醫刊的宣傳，以及事實的證明，所以現在一般頭腦較新的女性，已知自己的畢生幸福，決不是操縱在「命運」，而實在操縱於自己的發育，因為發育良好。則女性的一切特徵美發達，乳峯高聳，臀部丰腴，腰身靈活，走在路上，可不用矯揉造作，自能顯出全部神秘而誘人的曲線，此外如肌肉，面部，血液方面，因着卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛。者顯得豐滿，紅潤，自嫩，雖然脂粉不施，面部上自会泛起薄醉一般的嬌艷。至於理智的淸楚，思想的縝密，性情的溫柔，則允为此輩健美女性的特有天賦，所以她們無論在什麼地方，都能够　道許多優美條件，克制環境，戰勝環境，獲得最大的幸福，但如果缺陷重重，而猶不知「反躬自省」，以謀補救者，無此幸福也。</p>
<p>然則女性何爲而有此缺陷？此據中西著名婦科醫師與余研究結果，認爲完全由於營養不良，自凟，白帶，大病侵害，惡癮經年，月經不調，以及產後失於調補等各種原因，遂致卵巢機能失健，影響新陳代謝作用，故乳房鬆弛而萎癟？甚至平坦一如男子，臀部瘦削，肌肉枯槁，而允其覺得可憎者，雖在妙齡時期，而額上已滿佈皺紋，以這樣醜陋的女子，而欲角勝情塲，或博得丈夫的歡心，尚可得乎？唯一補救法，祗有服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素一最爲對症而特效，蓋此劑係由奧國醫聖斯丹那博士歷三十餘年之艱辛實騐而發明，復經歐美名醫多人之化騐證明，認爲功效偉大，藥性和平，服後一日夜間，卽能培補卯巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不惟可以根治各種婦女隱病，並能使乳峯高聳，面頰紅潤，靑春長駐。</p>

<h3>繼電車工潮之後　公共汽車又罷工　影響公眾交通殊為嚴重　勞資均應覺醒速圖解決</h3>
<p>公共租界英商上海電車公司全體工人自實行罷工後、卽將臨時解決辦法條件四項、先一日呈送總公司要求當局老慮後、從速核准、並於二十三日上午十時、推派代表四人、晋謁總秘書長包洛克氏、進行直接談判、惟因公司認爲工人要求過奢、對第一項增加工資一層、祇允連米貼等每日增加三角、而勞方則堅持須增加至四角五分、雙方爭執、達半小時、未得要領、而其餘三款，亦爲公司所拒絕、以致談判陷於僵局、昨日勞方代表、未曾續往總公司談判、情形愈趨惡化、詎電車工潮尚未獲解決辦法之際、而界內所恃以維持交通之英商中國公共汽車公司、突於昨晨亦一律罷工、公共租界之交通綫、除人力車外、至此已全部中斷、實爲本年度罷工潮中鉅大之波浪、法租界曾車公共汽車則仍然照常行駛、茲將昨日所得兩公司情形分誌於後、</p>
<h3>公共汽車　突告罷工</h3>
<p>英商中國公共汽車公司勞資糾紛、自經雙方於前（二十三日）二度直接談判後、意見已漸見接近、本可急轉直下、順利解決、不料昨日淸晨二時、勞方認爲公司屢决拖延、毫無誠意、突然快定怠工、並於昨日上午五時見諸行動、司機·售票·工務三部全部工友、採取一致步驟、實行罷工、勞方於昨日已準備四項先決條件、將於今日向公司當局提出、</p>

<p>工人並無　特殊要求</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英商公共汽車公司全體華籍僱員、今（廿四日）晨隨英商電車公司工人四日前所樹先例、而宣布總罷工、致公共租界內公共載送交通、益感不便、據公共汽車公司某員聲稱、勞資雙方進行談判、已歷多日、然罷工工人未曾提出特殊要求、渠不願披露談判之性質如何、亦不能言定資方是吾定數日內與勞方復開談判、</p>
<p>另派司機　維持交通</p>
<p>公共汽車公司工人此决罷工、已屬年內第二次、蓋今春亦曾發生工潮、而由外籍工人暫充司機也、革於資方今此擬吾復調外籍儸工充司機、尚未確息、惟勞方苟不復工、則公司方面明日（廿五日）或將派車維持主綫業務、今日將近午刻、叉據該公司某員稱、勞方此前提出之要求共二十三項、將於今日午後連同資方之答覆、發交各報公布、</p>
<p>辦公人員　相率遲到</p>
<p>今晨公共汽車公司突起罷工、無車駛出、致市民赴寫字間遲到者、大有人在、而出相汽車與人力車則利市三倍、同時、電車公司工人二千五百人之罷工風潮、仍未解決、因資勞雙方昨日會談、未獲妥洽也、赫德路電車廠四週今晨集有大批罷工工人、公司方面、乃在該廠週圍架置鐵絲網障碍物、以防不測、但晨間並無肇事等情、</p>
<h3>電車工潮　昨未談判</h3>
<p>上海電車公司勞資雙方、於前日（廿三日）在南蘇州河路總公司會商解決辦法、因關於增加工資部份、資方所允諾者、尚較勞方所要求之數目、尚相差一角五分、而其他條件、亦未能獲得雙方答覆、致談判未有結果、但在雙方均熱望工潮從速解決之情况下、的定昨晨再舉行直接談判、惟至上午時半、尚未見勞方代表前往、</p>
<p>勞方堅持　原有要求</p>
<p>電車公司總買辦華人吳志餘、於昨日上午十一時、以電話通知億定盤路九十五弄電車公司詢問究竟、並稱雙方對於工資部份、相差祗達一角五分、不難覓取妥善辦法、望卽速派代表來公司繼續商洽、當由電車公會某君在電話中答稱、工會方面、於聆悉四代表關於前日交涉經過之報吿後、卽轉吿全體工友、僉認關於增加工資部份、仍須維持原有之要求、請資方再度考慮迅予核准勞方所提增加工資之耍求、以便重開談判、早日復工、</p>
<p>先決問題　在增工資</p>
<p>記者昨曾叩詢某工友、關於增加工資之意見、據稱、在十九日向公司提出要求時、資方承認每人每日發給津貼一角、米貼一角半、而吾儕所要求者、爲每日增加工資五角、並主張將米貼津貼取消、因津貼費在年終時、公司方面有隨時取消之　、且吾儕之工資、自戰事發生後、卽米曾增加、前日談判時勞方爲表示熱忱合作起見、已將每日增加工資五角之提議、自動减至四角五分、而資方亦體念工友生活之困苦情狀、再加津貼五分、但與四角五分之要求、仍未能接近、故談判僵局之打開、須先從增加工資一條着手也、</p>
<p>今日或可　繼續談判</p>
<p>嗣又據記者探悉、勞方代表於前日談判未獲要領後、即將與資方會商情形、報吿全體工友、因昨日全體工友爲集議商討對策起見、故未派代表前往總公司繼續談商、茲聞今日勞方仍將派四代表前往該公司續商辦法、</p>
<p>工友露布　罷工真相</p>
<p>英商電車公司全體工友、昨發表一文、報吿「英電工潮的眞相」、其文云、全市同胞及友邦人士們、英電已停駛四天了、首先、目前的英電工人的生活概况、究竟是怎樣呢、在抗戰以前、公司每天的營業收入、不過五六千元、現在虹口一帶尚未通車、營業收人竟增至三萬元以上、但是、這種情形、可更苦煞了工人、工作時間名義上是八小時、而實際上、接班落班交錢等等、竟達十二小時以上、</p>
<p>生活高漲　何以維持</p>
<p>可是所得工資呢、在今日上海生活程度空前的高漲下、那能够支出這浩大的開銷、例如最近一個開車的人、他每月得工資廿二元至卅三元、外加米貼等、每月可收入五十元至六十多元之間、家里冉有妻子兒女及父母等人、現在米價達七十多元一石、所拿工資連一石米都難買、還有餘錢支付什麼房錢·柴鹽小菜等等開銷嗎、賣票銅匠、都差不多、再說開門　　等工友們、那眞可憐極了、每天連一塊錢工資都拿不到、大家請想想看、我們的生活是在怎樣的困苦、半飢半飽、大半每人都要久人家的債、很多很多的債、</p>
<p>公司當局　缺乏遠見</p>
<p>我們生活既如此困苦、公司方面、不但不能給與改善、善而更加深剝削和壓迫工人、開革班頭、是常有的事、允其在「八一三」以後、更加利害、對工人的任何合法團體總都採取着壓迫破壞的手段、捕捉過去工會的負責人、及熱心於工人利益的人、可是、最痛心的是公司當局的缺乏遠見、當在目前國際情形的變動與侵略者前方軍事進退兩難一無辦法的時候、拚命在部署後方、排斥英美利益、冀圖獨佔市塲、獨佔遠東、還有某些份子、在挑撥離間、這都不是偶然的事、正是道個時候、英電公司是經戰爭後的畸形的繁榮、每年賺了幾百萬、却不願稍稍地改善工人生活、在前一時期、我們工人曾多决提出要求、（去年六月十八日給大班信等）公司不願加以考慮、在這種情形下面、工人一經侵略者及某些份子利用一部份糊塗工人、來煽動工潮、達到他們新陰謀的目的、以便造成綸昌第二、</p>
<p>全體工友　應自覺醒</p>
<p>今天、英電工潮已形成道樣情形了、挑撥份子已跑進我們的隊伍里來了、這是我們的危險、同時也是公司的危險、全體工友們大家都站起來、提高我們的警覺性、我們是擁護幹工人福利的工會相反的我們就要反對、現在、我們機務車務三千多工友、一致要求公司當局對我們的要求加以考慮、我們總覺得今天上海的生活指數、與公司營業狀况、我們要求增加十五元工資、幷不算多、我們希望這要求公司就能答應、以免工潮僵持下去、</p>
<h3>崛內三浦　辦理移交</h3>
<p>駐滬總領事崛內干城、於前日下午四時三十分搭大洋丸抵滬後、業於昨日起赴日總領事與卸任總領三浦義秋辦理移交事宜、日內卽可吿竣、至三浦義秋則自奉令調任駐墨西哥公使後、速日向各處辭行、應酬頗忙、一俟交接竣事、定二十六日卸任離滬、搭輸經日赴墨西哥履新、</p>

<h3>米蠧操縱作祟　情節昨愈顯露　漲跌條忽憑謠言卒告下落　工部局物價處注意零售物價</h3>
<p>米商行賄判刑五月</p>
<p>工部局物價調查處昨發第三號公報稱、本處自第二决公報發行以來、對於各項主要物品之存底及價格方面、蒐集材料、不遺餘力、成績良佳、而於本問題之「零售」一方面、允爲着重、關於各業之應得合理利潤一層、業與各經售伙食·魚·肉·煤炭·及麵粉商人、開會多决、從事討論、討論之主題爲各該業與本局之合作方面、零售價格、已予糾正者多起、至於各項主要物品之通盤糾正、因範圍廣大、尚需時口耳、</p>
<p>米麥市況</p>
<p>近來市况、未見轉好、其主要原因、厥爲滙價趨跌、米價重見新高峯、米糧評價委員會雖經評定一號西貢米不得超過六十一元五角、但倘非洋米米價降落、則上項限價、設或重行評定、恐有提高之虞、國麥市况、上月月初、經當局之努力、已吿平定、乃目前又因多種關係、重趨惡化、結果國麥來源缺乏、粉價高翔、「家庭麵包」、已由每磅三角八分漲至四角一分、當局現正盡力設法改善、同時有大批洋麥進口、當使市面不致愈趨惡劣也、</p>
<p>煤價受制</p>
<p>煤斤市况、則相當滿意、黑市煤價、往往比來價減低百分之十至十五、此殆因多數小工廠停工、對於煤斤之需求、已見减弱、若干商店及攤販、因延不著籤標價、業予個別控究、並經處罰五元至十五元不等、此外、本處接獲關於抬價之報吿數起、均經派員調查、各有關係商店、經勸諭後、已自動將售價調整矣、</p>
<p>行賄處刑</p>
<p>投機米蠹、昨晨繼續活躍市塲、播傳是非、莫衷一是、乃致整個米市漲跌倐忽、惟存底充實、賣戶乘高價出籠、現貨充斥、並去路滯呆、市况卒吿疲落、結果較諸昨市洋米下落五六角不等、綜觀上述、可見本市米糧存底之充實、買戶顯感胃呆矣、同時亦可見投機米蠹之作祟、謠傳之不確也、叉米業掮客孫金觀、於本月十三日、在福州路靑蓮閣米行茶會市塲、以二號西貢米抬價至六十五元一石、意圖出售、當由駐塲探員茅國賣發覺、以其超越評價委會評定之限價、達六元一石之鉅、乃將其拘捕、而孫卽以法幣四十元行賄、意圖買放未遂經解由特一法院、除超越限價部份已被判處拘役十五日、已誌前報、至行賄部份、昨晨復由該院施推事宜吿判決、孫行使賄賂、意圖買放、判處有期徒刑五個月示儆、、當時在庭旁聽者、莫不稱快、</p>
<p>豐收情形</p>
<p>據米業界消息、國米每日仍可源源運滬、僅數量較往昔稍减而已、祗須待某批米糧成交後、卽可向當地請領、「搬運證」一俟「搬運證」辦就、該項米糧便可隨時裝運來滬、故米市塲之傳說、全係故意造謠、以爲高抬米價之張本、無足置信、米雖源源不斷、惟投機者亦不斷囤積、蓋其慾壑永無饜足之期、致造成此時此地空前奇昂之米價、據悉京滬滬杭兩綫及滬郊浦東一帶、今秋花稻俱熟、花可收每畝兩包、稻每畝統扯收米四石、如能運滬、獲利豈但信倍蓰、民食實母庸憂慮、唯恐謠言百出、乘機抬價而已、</p>
<h3>滬輪仍駛海防　航務關係船期略有更動　日艦砲轟曼麗輪之經過</h3>
<p>法日協定於星期日（二十二）簽字後、曾傳日軍已登陸、惟本市洋商航業界、至昨晚止、尚未接確實報吿、因此滬越航綫並無變化、船期依然排定、</p>
<p>改期啟椗</p>
<p>惟太古公司慶元輪、原定二十六日由滬駛防、現改二十七日晨啟椗、怡和洋行阜生輸、本定星期五（二十七）由滬開往海防、兼灣香港、昨據該公司宣稱、該輪此决係由港駛防、現正由防經港返滬、在途稍有躭擱、恐本週內不及返滬、故由滬駛防期、不免有所更動、明生輪仍定十月一日開往海防、</p>
<p>曼麗脫險</p>
<p>英商曼麗馬勒輪、本月十九日由滬開往海門、當晚駛入椒江、安抵目的地、詎二十日由海門裝載客貨駛返來滬時、在椒江口外被日艦砲擊、當時發砲</p>
<p>達十餘發</p>
<p>形勢異常危險、該輪船主卽發出求救信號、一面下錨停泊、日艦發砲後、即派汽艇載日軍登輪檢查、船主責以何故任意砲擊商輪、日方稱該輪不受日艦命令、擅自行駛、故砲擊為戒、其時附近英艦獲得求救信號、即</p>
<p>駛往保護</p>
<p>經艦上長官與日方交涉後、始允釋放、該輪當於二十二日晨受英艦保護之下、駛返來滬、已於前晚七時抵埠、所載客貨幸吿無恙、已分別起卸上岸、據悉此决被擊情形、甚爲嚴重、</p>
<p>船身受損</p>
<p>駕駛間一角着彈、雖損壞不重、而旅客則已飽愛驚嚇、聞該輪將在滬稍加修理、仍擬續航、惟海門航綫、沿途困難甚多、公司當局一面請英領署向日方交涉、保證以後航行之安全、一面將停止搭客、以免危險、至何日復航、尚未決定、</p>

<p>聽眾滿座</p>
<p>本月二十二日下午三時（老鐘點）是日開講適大雨、故取得聽講券者大半未到、然聽者仍滿座、且極法意講經者爲沈達齡·姚太平·楊中一·三君、沈君年近八旬、且有足疾、扶杖到社、述發起講經社宗旨、幷略講五敎之同點云、本社發起之目的、在求世界之大同、欲求世界之大同、先在破除各宗敎之界限、</p>

<h3>「罷工」與「揩油」</h3>
<p>— 丁人</p>
<p>上海在這一年來的「罷工」風潮，已到了「節期式」的，連續不斷地發生着的階段——祇要是一個生活程度增高的浪頭打下來的時候，出賣勞力的人們便不得不為了求取生存而掙扎，結果　釀成了工潮。可是，這工潮却決不是工人們自己挑動或是願意引起的，相反的，勞方總是忍耐到不可再忍的時候才提出要求——適應生存的最低限度的要求。</p>
<p>當然，在賢明的資方就覺得大家應出於讓步，而致和衷共濟地來安渡目前的難關，但也有少數資方，却不為大局設想，而一味地固執成見，以致鬧得沒法下台。這裏筆者決不偏袒於任何一方，而是覺得應該把問題看得大一點，遠一點，——在「時此時此地」大家應該和睦相處，而不　造成「籬笆破，野狗躜，」的有利於第三者的局勢。同時，丁潮的產生，這責任，在基本上講是有着它的社會根源——外面的封鎖，壟斷，再加上淺見的資本家的投機操縱，於是火上澆油，烈燄衝天，結果便鬧出罷工風潮之類的事情，影響社會的治安和秩序，因此，勞資雙方都應該看淸楚問題的癥結所在，而應以絕大的寬容態度來謀取和平解決之途。</p>
<p>從今年三月的永安鴻章等紗廠的關廠工潮至今，半年來總算是沿着這一生活水牛綫行進着，沒有多大變動，所以也就相安無事。到上月底工部局發表七八兩月「生活指數」，一般地講，是比今年上半年又提高了百分之四十至五十，再加上近日來的米價飛漲，當然是釀成此决電車工潮的主要原因；同時，照此情形發展下去，勞方為了一家數口，嗷嗷待哺的催迫，為了人類本能的求生的要求，難保不生共他的枝節，故筆者認為一個提高生活的浪潮壓下來的時候，勞資雙方都應認淸上述的基本原因，而在大家讓步——大家節省自己的浪費，而資方的賺錢也應該放棄「標的制」，（一定要賺到　少，吾則就不　）這是無理由的固執成見的；在勞方平日浪費是較少的，但也不必提出過分的要求，以致造成社會的不安，前面已經說過，要防止「漁翁得利」的局勢——的情形下「未雨綢繆」，相依為命，而使勞資雙方都能活得下去！</p>
<p>這裹就電車公司的工潮，略陳管見於後：</p>
<p>第一，資方提高員工正常的生活津貼費，而使賣票員等减少意外收入（揩油）。這樣，對公司方面或許不是損失而反有利，也米可知。至於芷常津貼，薪給數量等等可由公司發表書面公告，曲直是非是有社會人士之公論。</p>
<p>第二，在勞方，更可養成不「揩油」的美德，允其重要的：——賣票員往往因為「揩油」之輕而易舉，而將金錢浪擲於「花會」「賭窟」者為數甚衆，筆者在車上也時有所聞。但收入一經固定，勞方就會感到有節省的必要，結果收穫意外的效果，或許反在意料之中。</p>
<p>第三，就乘容的立塲來說，對公司的賺錢有一定的數字（照外滙核算），而支出增加，但「揩油」照舊，那末「羊毛出在羊身上」，倒霉的當然又是乘客，可是乘客們的肩膀也將要壓不起了。所以，祗要是公司對勞方的待遇在「此時此地」認為確是公允的話，那末，乘客監視賣票的「揩油」，無形中便成為自己的事情，這樣，公同不致吃虧，賣票的收入也可以大家平均，而車價也不致一加再加，而使乘客大有「行路難」之感了！</p>
<p>如能按照上述原則進行，那不但「揩油」之風可煞，而且今後的工潮也可獲免，甚而社會治安也可安寗多了。</p>
<h3>「孤島」人士的口福</h3>
<p>— 同光作</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>這時我當然不能站定。我索性跟在小李的後面，迎着那來人走去。我的心房似有些異樣，但仍保持着鎮靜。我的頭低沉着，我的手揷在衣袋裹，握住了那支小手槍，我的步子故意放得很緩慢。</p>
<p>我和那來人相隔只有五六步遠了。我隨意地抬頭一瞧，見那身材高大的人，穿着一件深靑毛葛長夾袍，頭上棕色的呢帽，帽邊壓得很低，他的眼鏡是淺茶色的，嘴唇上依舊留着短鬚。他的脚上穿一雙尖頭式的紫色皮鞋，他的下頷也果眞是方闊的。這個人眞是趙伯雄！</p>
<p>那小李旣然走在我的前面，當然是要比我先和他接觸。那趙伯雄忽揚一揚手，向小李說：「開門。」</p>
<p>小李站住了呆了一呆，好像一時答不出話。他頓了一頓，才吞吐地說：「門開着。有——有一個朋友在裏面。」</p>
<p>小李的一呆一頓，當然會引起那人的疑心。他也立定了脚步，躊躇了一下。「有一個朋友？——姓什麽？」</p>
<p>小李又勉強地回答：「他——他沒有說。他說要找你先生，叫我開了門——他是個穿西裝的，有些兒黑鬚——」</p>
<p>這個時候也已走近他的身旁，情勢上不容我留頓，衹能繼續前進。我可能退回去通知霍桑嗎？那當然不可能。其實霍桑旣然有過內外接應的話，一定也用不着我去通知。當我和他擦身而過的時候，我覺得他的眼角裏也在瞧我。我當然不便回瞧他，不過我相信我周身的神經這時已全部緊張，允共是我的聽神經特別敏銳。</p>
<p>他又繼續問道：一個人嗎？」小李好像沒有回答，那回答大概是用動作表示的。趙伯雄繼續發問：「來了多少時候？」</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>據說：「人在社會上做事，是要以「服務」為目的，不能談到「賺錢」。說到錢字，就不够「淸高」，想來這話祗好讓一輩凸肚子的人去說說罷了，怎能適用在做一天吃一天的無產階級裏？</p>
<p>在今日一切生活資料還得化錢去買的社會裏，我們固然要「服務」，使生產增加；但同時也該要會「賺錢」，使生活安定。所以「賺錢」的方式，除了不是出賣靈魂，幹那無恥的勾當外，實在是「服務」應有的酬報。</p>
<p>「賺錢」的多少，是和「服務」的廣狹成正比例的。但是事實上有很多「服務」輕便，甚至整天不做什麼，而賺很多錢的所謂「特殊階級」；有「服務」繁重，却賺不到維持最低生活費的所謂「被剝削階級」，所以我們應該找尋「服務」和「賺錢」的平衡眞理，才能澈底減少許多不安和罪惡，也就是反對無端剝削人們的服務機會，以及揭穿他肩着好多美名騙人家餓了肚子去「服務」的假面具。</p>

<h3>平劇脞談</h3>
<p>— 語初</p>
<p>平劇中主角死後，屍身殭立，須俟仇人向屍下跪後方倒者，的有三劇：若戰太平之華雲，兩郎山之楊七郎，及潞安州之陸登。該三人中，華雲與陸登，均係自刎而亡；楊七郎則被綁于芭蕉樹上，川亂箭射死。因彼等俱為當代之忠臣，戲中為顯示其忠勇起見，故死後屍身不倒，以表露之。共間當數陸登之不倒，為最有意義，蓋若是固足以感動金兀朮收隨子文龍為義子，而保切陸氏之後代香烟也。楊七郎則被箭射後，尚欲潘洪向彼連呼三聲爺爺，方應聲而倒，似乎過於兒戲矣。華雲臨死前，陳友諒勸其歸降，竟出言不遜，謂如陳妹願與其配成　　，卽允所請，似亦有失大將風度。</p>
<p>包公在舞台上所見，大都均掛黑滿，其掛白滿與不帶髯口者，僅各有一齣，卽長壽星與奇寃報是。長壽星又名太君辭朝，係老且之正工戲，滬上除張少泉偶一露演外，殊不多見。包公在該劇中，戴白滿，處配角地位，故不為人所注　耳。奇寃報中之包公，官僅居定遠縣縣令，職位低微，甫出道未久，故不帶鬚以示其年事尚輕也。然前在黃金見袁世海飾該角，則戴黑滿，未知孰是</p>
<p>專工紅生之角兒，必兼擅岳飛戲，及衰派老生戲，固有其理由在焉。演紅生者，多數因嗓悶，或亮而乏韻味，未能勝任老生安工戲，故不得不趨于着重做派工架一路之關劇矣。岳飛與關公僅有揉臉與本臉之分，其氣度頗相像，均具有威武肅穆忠義凜然之概，是所以擅演關戲者必長于演岳飛一角。至若衰派戲，亦重做而不重唱，與其條件相符，故能兼擅也。</p>

<h3>好萊塢導演的怪癖</h3>
<p>— 章</p>
<p>世界上許多有名的人，常常有一些古怪的脾氣或習慣，好萊塢的名人可以算得不少了，現在讓我們從導演的怪癖說起吧。</p>
<p>西席地密爾　衣服上右邊的一個袋，時時刻刻是放了許多輔幣，每逢他在拍着一幕戲時，他的右手總是放入袋裏，用兩個指頭把一個半元銀幣玩弄着。</p>
<p>威廉台德爾　當拍着一幕戲，他全身緊張得好像一頭獵狗那樣，手臂都是直挺挺的，並且咬着嘴唇，有時咬着上唇，有時咬着下唇。</p>
<p>佛蘭克鮑才琪　每拍一部新片，總有一種新的舉勸，有時手上不離一根竹手杖，一面看着他人工作，一面不停地把手杖在手中轉動。</p>
<p>金亨利更古怪每在一幕戲拍完了後，他便脫掉他的金邊眼鏡，同時朝着剛才演着戲的地方，深思地凝視着。</p>
<p>佛蘭克洛埃特　每逢拍着一幕戲，頭　是俯着，而且不脫掉帽子，在攝影機旁邊不作聲地來往踱着，像一頭野獸馴服的樣子。</p>
<p>威廉凱萊　心情緊張時，便用手把他的烟斗緊緊抓着，好像一個小孩子握着了母親的手來求安慰一樣。</p>
<p>的翰福特　是一位態度最莊嚴的導演，他也有一個怪脾氣，他的衣袋裏總是放了許多夾紙用的小夾子，他一個個拿出來，把它拉直了，放在牙齒間去輕輕地咬着。</p>
<p>其餘還有大導演劉別謙，的翰史泰爾等都有很奇怪有趣的癖好，留着下决再談吧。</p>
<h3>再談陳德霖桃李</h3>

<p>據說正式經過拜師禮，只有黃桂秋李香勻二人，紅拂女雖曾發帖，結果因為知道她是妓女而作罷；尚小雲一度談過拜師，後因某事不為陳氏所喜，辭之，尚與陳因此失歡者數年云。（不受酬）</p>

<h3>彈詞人物素描　嚴雪亭</h3>
<p>— 葉嘉樂</p>
<p>在目今的游藝界中，彈詞也佔了相當的地位。　塲林立，電臺節目屢屢增多，小輩英雄的層出不竅，以及各刊物的評述，這都是良好的證明。嚴雪這就是為着彈詞界努力的一個；他是徐雲志的得意大弟子；出場不久，就蜚聲海上。到現在，雖然沒多年工夫，却紅得　紫，在收音機中，幾乎隨時可以聽到他的節目。至於他所以紅的原因，究竟為甚麽呢？據我個人檢討的結果，不外乎下列四點：</p>
<p>（一）天賦佳喉　他在彈唱時，那隻清脆而甜蜜的嗓子，真有幾分引誘力量。並且一天唱到晚，絲亳無懈，這當然是致紅的最大因素。</p>
<p>（二）口齒伶俐他無論說表和起角色。口齒非常淸爽，允其是起小家碧玉這一類人物，更顯出他的藝衛天才。這就是第二個緣故。</p>
<p>（三）開篇通俗他在收音機中，唱開篇時，往往採取通俗和富有滑稽的開篇，像江北夫妻相駡，百頭開篇等，都是早己紅透了。因此就引起了一大部人的愛護。這是第三個原因</p>
<p>（四）服飾精美書塲中的老聽客，每天可以看到他那精美而淸潔的服飾，好像天天在做新郎似的，打扮得富麗堂皇。然而因為這樣，却引起了一部份人的歡迎，這就是第四點原因。</p>
<p>末了，希望嚴雪亭，不要專門在服裝上翻新花樣，應該努力在藝術一方面，那末就不難在後起中稱雄了！</p>

<h3>Ceasefire on the Vietnamese Border Yesterday Afternoon; French Officials Acknowledge the Situation Remains Grave; Japanese Commander Dissatisfied with Hanoi Agreement, Claims Large-Scale Offensive Imminent; Lang Son City and Airfield Subjected to Concentrated Bombardment by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Prepare All, Awaiting Orders to Move</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a Liuzhou dispatch, French and Japanese troops clashed again yesterday at the border between Zhennanguan and Dong Dang. The Japanese troops fired on the French outposts first, and the French troops immediately retaliated, repelling them. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to reliable sources, the Yunnan provincial troops are currently cooperating actively with the central government troops along the border. If the Japanese troops attempt to invade Yunnan, they will fight shoulder to shoulder. This well-equipped Yunnan army is familiar with the local conditions, and their services as guides will be of great help to the central government troops. The possibility of the Chinese troops launching an offensive is not considered an exception here. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Authoritative sources recently stated that the authorities will not order Chinese troops to enter Vietnam before the situation there is clarified. However, the Chinese troops are currently awaiting orders, ready to act immediately upon receiving them. A Chinese military spokesperson hinted that if the Vietnamese government invites China to cooperate, Chinese troops will enter Vietnam to assist France in resisting Japan. French sources here recently received news from Vietnam stating that General Martin, the commander of the French troops in Vietnam, made the prompt decision to station troops in the north to defend against Japanese invasion due to the Japanese attack on Vietnam on Sunday. It is reported that General Martin's agreement to the Hanoi Agreement was very reluctant. Chinese officials here expressed considerable disdain for French Foreign Minister Baudouin's comments on the Hanoi Agreement, saying that Baudouin's remarks about the military measures against Japan being temporary and exceptional, and only limited to the time when the Sino-Japanese War has not ended, are self-deceiving words. Baudouin's cover-up only increases the suspicion of the Pétain regime. The most vehement opposition to Vichy after the signing of the Hanoi Agreement comes from the feelings of Chongqing. (United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Haiphong – Border warfare ceased at noon, but according to French officials, the situation remains "extremely serious." General Ando Rikichi, commander of the Japanese forces in South China, has great power and has declared his dissatisfaction with the Hanoi Agreement concluded by Lieutenant General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese inspection team, and threatened to launch a large-scale sea, land, and air offensive against Vietnam today. Nishihara urgently requested Ando to postpone the action, which has taken effect. Nishihara is now departing for Hainan Island to meet with Ando. Twelve Japanese aircraft flew over Haiphong today, and alarms were sounded, but the French troops did not fire, and the Japanese aircraft withdrew. The French plan to fully mobilize all men is now actively underway, and the evacuation of women and children from the northern regions is still ongoing. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Haiphong – French and Japanese troops on the Vietnamese border resumed fighting yesterday afternoon, which continued throughout the night. It is reported that the fighting was still ongoing at 10:00 this morning. According to French sources, the Japanese troops attacked French positions near Dong Dang, 12 miles from the Vietnamese border. The Japanese side sent aircraft to assist in the battle, bombing French ground troops and French airfields on the border. It is reported that two Japanese aircraft have been shot down. As the situation has once again become serious, French women and children in the border areas are being evacuated. When Japanese aircraft flew over the border, air raid alarms were sounded throughout Vietnam, and the public took refuge in air raid shelters in an orderly manner. French officials stated that the Japanese attempt to enter Vietnam from China is a violation of the agreement signed on Sunday, which stipulates that the Japanese army in South China may not enter Vietnam until a supplementary agreement has been established. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Hanoi – Although the official announcement from Tokyo stated that the Vietnamese army had surrendered at 11:00 on Monday morning, the Japanese army in South China continued to attack Vietnam yesterday afternoon. Two Japanese aircraft flew to Lang Son in Annam, concentrating their bombing on the airfield and the city. According to reports received indirectly from the French side, the Japanese troops bombed the city again yesterday afternoon, and fighting continued in the suburbs of Lang Son. French officials here stated that the French troops were forced to withdraw from the outposts when the Japanese troops attacked Dong Dang on Sunday night. Air raid alarms were also sounded in Hanoi for the first time yesterday, likely when the Japanese aircraft were heading to attack Lang Son. The aircraft took off from aircraft carriers off the coast of Vietnam. Most residents here took refuge in air raid shelters. Hanoi – The fate of Vietnam today rests entirely on whether Lieutenant General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, can persuade General Ando, commander of the Japanese forces in South China, to halt military action against Vietnam. Lieutenant General Nishihara boarded a minesweeper this morning to Hainan Island to personally visit Ando. On his way to Hainan, Lieutenant General Nishihara also persuaded a Japanese transport ship, a cruiser, and three destroyers heading to Haiphong not to allow soldiers to disembark. While Lieutenant General Nishihara is making a final effort to seek a peaceful resolution, the Franco-Japanese agreement signed on September 22nd has been canceled due to the public perception that it has not been properly implemented. The Japanese side has notified the French that a large-scale attack is imminent and that bombing of Haiphong will begin at dawn. It is reported that the Guangxi-Vietnam border is very quiet this morning, but French and Japanese troops continue to "stand in confrontation." According to sources in Tangjing, French troops have recaptured Dong Dang, and the Annamese troops are also resisting the Japanese to a considerable extent. According to an observer returning from the border, the Japanese suffered huge losses when attacking Lang Son. The French heavy artillery behind the strong fortifications of Lang Son has made the Japanese pay a heavy price. Corpses of Japanese soldiers are piled up along the way. It is also said that the Japanese have no time to remove the bodies of Japanese soldiers, and only cut off their hands to identify them. All French troops have been ordered not to fire on Japanese troops unless they attack first. Twelve Japanese bombers flew over Haiphong this morning to show their strength. The French anti-aircraft guns did not fire after seeing the Japanese aircraft, and the Japanese aircraft did not drop bombs. Officials here announced that French and Japanese troops have not engaged in combat since last night. When Japanese aircraft flew over Haiphong this morning, air raid alarms were also sounded in Hanoi. The schools here have been closed, and there seems to be some curiosity about these air raid alarms. Yesterday, a train carrying more than 200 wounded soldiers who had fought with the Japanese army on Sunday night arrived here from the border. Hanoi has established Red Cross hospitals in several areas to prepare for the wounded. Red Cross flags are hung high at each aid station. Yesterday morning, French troops controlled all vehicles here. The Eurasian Aviation planes to Chongqing have stopped, and the Imperial Airways flights to Hong Kong have also been suspended. All French ships are currently docked in Haiphong. French officials last night dismissed the Japanese official statement that the Japanese army had entered Vietnam peacefully in a friendly manner. They also attributed the responsibility for the border conflict to the Japanese. One official said, "Those who enter the border with armed troops at midnight cannot be considered friendly." French officials insisted that the Franco-Japanese agreement signed here on Sunday afternoon did not allow Japanese troops from Guangzhou to enter Vietnam. They said that the French side had agreed to discuss this issue at a later date, and Lieutenant General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese military delegation, also accepted this suggestion. The French authorities stated that the information that Lieutenant General Nishihara informed the Guangzhou army was that the Guangzhou army was not allowed to cross the border immediately. (United Press, 24th) Residents have also been evacuated. The Chinese Consulate has also notified Chinese residents to leave. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Hanoi – Regarding the conflict between the French and Japanese forces in North Vietnam, officials have issued a communiqué stating that the situation in North Vietnam this morning has not changed substantially. The two sides have not fired on each other since last night. The French side has been ordered to retaliate only if attacked again. Several Japanese transport ships are currently outside the port of Haiphong, escorted by warships. General Nishihara went to Haiphong last night to order the captains of these ships to remain calm. So far, the captains have been able to comply. The Japanese Air Force had originally announced that it would bomb Haiphong, but it has also abandoned this plan. Only about twelve aircraft flew over Haiphong for two or three hours, but did not carry out any attack. Major cities in North Vietnam issued air raid warnings when Japanese aircraft flew over them. In addition, there are various rumors about the number of French casualties, and there is no consensus. According to the latest news, the number of casualties is no more than about twenty. Once the exact number is known, it will be announced. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to a Japanese army communiqué, the French defenders of Dong Dang on the Vietnamese border resisted the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam yesterday morning and have since</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Trend of International Development</h3>
<p>For the past three months, due to the elusive nature of the Franco-Japanese negotiations regarding Vietnam, the current situation in the Far East surrounding this issue has also presented a confusing state. Furthermore, after Italy declared its entry into the war, the further division of the international camp became questionable, leading to multiple paths for the overall situation. Now, a compromise between France and Japan has finally emerged, first revealing the so-called Vietnam issue. Its resolution simultaneously breaks the ambiguity of the current situation in the Far East and will likely lead to many specific developments immediately. In the near future, it will inevitably provide a definite and concrete answer to the questionable international situation.</p>
<p>The Vietnam issue is now entering another stage following the agreement, which is not without doubt. According to yesterday's news, the Japanese troops who invaded Dong Dang, Vietnam, from the Guangxi border have been resisting the French army for the past two days and are still engaged in fierce fighting. The Vietnamese authorities claim that the so-called French army has surrendered and the Japanese army has "entered Vietnam in a friendly manner" is "completely unfounded." Therefore, the core of the Vietnam issue is still uncertain. Everything from now on depends on the relationship between the French Vietnamese government and the French garrison, as well as with the Pétain government. As far as we can remember, not long ago, rumors circulated about differences in opinion within the French national policy, especially regarding how to deal with Japanese oppression, and the Vietnamese authorities had the intention of breaking away from the Pétain government. Later, after the change of the Vietnamese Governor, both sides emphasized the slogan of "national unity." There have been subtle developments in the meantime. Therefore, if the current Vietnamese military and civilians are angered by the mistakes of the humiliating policy and resolutely refuse to compromise with Japan and engage in resistance to aggression, forming another spark of justice in the world, then the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries should immediately feel a moral responsibility, seize this critical opportunity, and take decisive action. Provide Vietnam with the greatest assistance and cooperation!</p>
<p>However, regardless of how the Vietnam issue itself evolves, in the current situation, the future situation in the Far East and the entire international situation, after several months of brewing, until the announcement of the signing of the Vietnam Agreement the day before yesterday, have embarked on a relatively certain direction, which is not difficult for those who care about international affairs to discern.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the Far East, the defeatists in France have clearly announced their recognition of Japan's creation of a "New Order in East Asia." Subsequently, the "authoritative spokesperson" of Italy publicly praised it. However, Germany's attitude has not yet been expressed as of the time of this commentary. Although we imagine that Germany and Italy will never deviate from each other on such a major issue, considerable differences are unavoidable. As for how the angle of these differences will wax and wane in the future, it depends on the extent to which Japan will depend on Germany and Italy. Assuming complete alignment, then Japan's desire to "drive out the white power from Asia in one fell swoop" is likely to be recognized by the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. And the current Vietnam issue is only the beginning. In response to this situation, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China should immediately consider the positions of each country and take harmonious action. In China's case, there is undoubtedly the greatest freedom of action. Under this action, if Vietnam resists the Japanese army, then it is China's comrade-in-arms and can fight shoulder to shoulder; otherwise, it cannot affect China's actions. As for Britain and the United States, their positions on this issue are completely consistent. Their interests in Asia have been fundamentally threatened, and they have also completely dispelled their concerns about Japan becoming an ally of Germany and Italy. Assuming a smooth development, then their only principle is cooperation. The specific actions under the principle of cooperation will be nothing more than: First, effectively applying pressure on Japan, such as imposing embargoes, etc. If this is ineffective, then the second step is to apply all possible efforts to directly stop Japan. The most effective way to stop it is, first, to increase aid to China; second, the British and American navies should immediately mobilize in the Far East to correct the reality with action. For example, the rumored reopening of the Burma Road and the United States' ability to use the Singapore naval base will all be inevitable. As for the Soviet Union, although it is more indirect than the United States, Britain, and China, the new Eastern situation that has emerged in the past few days means that the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent, and further aid to China's resistance against Japan will naturally be emphasized as a conclusion.</p>
<p>surrendered after resisting the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam for eleven hours. According to telegraph dispatches from Haiphong, Lieutenant Colonel Lopert, commander of the French troops in Dong Dang, was killed in action. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – A Japanese military communiqué announced that when the Japanese army entered Dong Dang on the Vietnamese border, it encountered resistance. The Japanese army then occupied the semi-permanent defense works near the area, capturing 140 French soldiers, including several officers. The French suffered 130 deaths, and the Japanese army seized two mountain guns, one mortar, two heavy machine guns, and 200 rifles. The Japanese army suffered very few losses. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – A Japanese semi-official source announced that, according to news received here, the Japanese army suffered a total of one hundred casualties in the conflict that occurred in Dong Dang yesterday. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Side Holds Emergency Meeting; Demands Compensation from France for Losses</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The National Government held an emergency meeting yesterday due to the Japanese army's actions in Vietnam to discuss the overall situation. The meeting will continue today, and its resolutions have not been announced. However, it is reported that if China suffers losses due to the Franco-Japanese agreement, it will demand compensation from the French government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the French Embassy yesterday, reiterating China's right to take self-defense measures and stating that the French government must be responsible for any losses. After the news of the Japanese army's attack on Vietnam spread, the most common commentary here was that if the Japanese army's attack on Vietnam was to resolve the China Incident, then the Japanese army had taken the wrong direction, because the Japanese army did not take the route through Vietnam to advance to the Chinese border, but is currently heading south from the Guangxi border to enter Vietnam. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – This morning's editorial in the Central Daily News urged Britain to immediately open the Burma Road to provide China with full assistance in transporting military supplies. It also stated that although the United States has repeatedly warned, the Japanese army still attacked Vietnam. This should be regarded as Japan deliberately offending the United States. Japan obviously wants to preempt the United States before it completes the construction of its two-ocean navy. The newspaper also appealed to Germany not to be used by Japan and allow it to pursue its selfish expansionist policies, while not providing Germany with strong assistance. If the powers do not take decisive action now, the overall situation in the Pacific will deteriorate rapidly and become irreparable. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Knowledgeable people here mostly hold the view that Japan's invasion of Vietnam is not aimed at China, but is an important step in its southward expansion policy, with Vietnam as the starting point for future attacks on the Dutch East Indies and Singapore. The Chinese people are now awaiting the reactions of the United States, Britain, and other countries to Japan's move. All sectors of the Chinese community believe that the United States will intensify its economic retaliation against Japan, and Britain will provide China with greater assistance in order to cooperate with China to jointly curb Japan's southward expansion. Therefore, the Chinese people now have the hope that the Burma Road will be reopened, so that the United States can transport various supplies along this route to strengthen China's resistance. If China collapses, Japan will be able to freely carry out its southward expansion policy. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the French authorities regarding the Franco-Japanese agreement on Vietnam, with Zheng reiterating that China retains the right to take defensive measures and stating that the French government should be fully responsible for the consequences that this agreement will cause. In this regard, its natural trend will be to connect with the powerful naval base of Singapore that Britain has granted for use. (United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington – Japan's invasion of Vietnam has raised the possibility of the United States adopting new economic plans to restrict Japan. According to news from Hawaii, the new restrictions will include increased control over the export of gasoline, scrap iron, and other items to Japan. Although the Japanese side has stated that it respects the territorial integrity of Vietnam and French sovereignty, American officials believe that Japan's invasion of Vietnam is a serious threat to American interests in the Far East. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that events in the Vietnam situation are changing rapidly, making it impossible to understand the clear truth of its development. However, the current status of Vietnam seems to have been overturned, and this overturning of the status quo was achieved under the use of force. The United States has repeatedly declared its position of condemning such actions. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington – Citing the words of French Foreign Minister Baudouin, the Vichy message claiming that the United States had approved the compromise reached between Japan and the Vietnamese authorities was severely rejected by the US State Department, which issued a statement saying, "The US government has not approved the concessions made by the French authorities in Vietnam to Japan." Secretary of State Hull initially declared his disagreement with Japan's invasion of Vietnam. Hull said, "The status quo has been disrupted by intimidation, which is now obvious." (International News Service, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington – Political figures here hinted that the United States may go beyond diplomatic protests to express its opposition to Japan's actions in Vietnam. According to predictions from well-informed sources, the United States will not leave this challenge unanswered. US government officials have increasingly trusted Britain's resistance in Europe, so their belief in a more active participation by the United States in stabilizing the status quo in the Pacific has also been enhanced. According to military officials, Britain is currently considering sending reinforcements to Singapore. Unofficial opinions suggest that the United States may express its opposition in the following ways: (1) Recalling Ambassador Grew to the United States for consultations; (2) Completely banning the export of gasoline, scrap iron, and other supplies; (3) Increasing the supply of military goods to the Dutch East Indies. Secretary of State Hull's condemnation of Japan's actions in Vietnam was published in large print in today's newspapers. Hull said, "The disruption of the status quo in Vietnam seems quite obvious. This action was achieved while taking advantage of France's difficulties. The US position of opposing this method has already been declared." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Make Strong Statements; No Third-Party Intervention Allowed</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today declared that any country that "dares" to interfere with Japan's "sacred mission" in Vietnam will be destroyed. The Yomiuri Shimbun wrote that the Japanese government will not hesitate to reject any protests from third countries against Japan's invasion of Vietnam. The newspaper said that Japan's intentions in Vietnam "are extremely peaceful and constructive and have already gained the full understanding of the French government." It went on to criticize third countries for interfering in Franco-Japanese negotiations from the beginning and now revealing their "intimidating attitude" towards Japan. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the Franco-Japanese agreement on Vietnam should be used to "establish East Asian mutual assistance and prosperity" and can promote the "resolution of the China Incident." The newspaper stated, "If any foreign country dares to interfere with this sacred mission, then Japan should destroy it." (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese Asahi Shimbun today wrote that since the Japanese army has already entered Vietnam, Japan should now more forcefully advance northwest to cut off the Burma</p>
<h3>An Outcry Against America: Retaliatory Measures to Be Taken</h3>
<p>Washington - Influential members of Congress here believed last night that (1) a new economic embargo, (2) American use of the British military port of Singapore, and (3) repairs to the Yunnan-Burma Highway to transport munitions to Chongqing, could be seen as a joint Anglo-American response to Japan's invasion of Vietnam. In addition to the outcry from Congress against Japan's invasion of Vietnam, Secretary of State Hull reiterated America's "opposition" to Japanese actions in Vietnam. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, the Navy Department might cancel its original plan to send a portion of the American fleet to the California coast. However, official sources did not consider this rumor accurate or reliable. Hull also stated yesterday that the United States is urging Britain to continue to keep the Yunnan-Burma Road open so that munitions can continue to be imported into Chongqing. Hull condemned Japan, saying, "The events in Vietnam are progressing so rapidly that we cannot obtain the details of every minute. However, one thing is very clear: the 'status quo' of Vietnam is no longer being respected. The US government has repeatedly expressed its condemnation and opposition to this matter." Hull also said that America's attitude towards the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road has not changed. He stated that Washington has always been dissatisfied with the obstruction of any transportation lines. Hull also said that he could not directly comment on whether the United States had raised the issue of opening the Yunnan-Burma Road during talks with the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister. While Secretary of State Hull clearly expressed American dissatisfaction with Japan's actions in Vietnam, other administrative leaders temporarily remained silent, unwilling to express their opinions on whether the United States and Britain would take retaliatory measures. However, many members of Congress publicly condemned Japan's actions, considering them a threat to the Philippines and other important American transportation lines. Several congressmen believed that Japan's actions would again provoke calls for strict economic sanctions against Japan. Representative Gossert, a Democrat from California, said that the more Japan expands, the "more threatened the United States becomes, not only to the Philippines but also to other American transportation lines." He said that he is receiving a large volume of letters demanding the implementation of strict embargo laws against Japan. He said that Japan's actions in Vietnam will cause even stronger embargo demands in the United States. Republican representative Voorhis said that he is "alarmed by Japan's invasion." He stated, "I have previously advocated an embargo against Japan, and I still hold that position. The more Japan expands, the more we should embargo all important war materials to Japan and stop importing silk from Japan." Republican member Clark recalled that Hull had repeatedly warned Japan that the United States would seriously consider any actions that disrupt the status quo in the Far East. He said, "As we deliberate, Japan has been steadily advancing. I do not understand why we are still avoiding taking the most severe action against Japan's recent actions." Clark said that Japan's actions in the Far East directly endanger the Philippine Islands and "pose a threat to peace in the Pacific." Recently, the State Department issued a denial of yesterday's statement by French Foreign Minister Baudouin, in which Baudouin said that the United States had approved the Franco-Japanese agreement signed in Hanoi on Sunday. The State Department declared, "Our country has never, at any time or place, agreed to France's concessions to Japan." Recently, some people believed that the retaliatory measures that the United States will take are directly against Japan. Embargoes are not directly against Japan, but the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road "for trade purposes" and other similar steps have been mentioned. Observers recalled that whenever Japan makes a major move in China, the United States takes similar countermeasures, either strengthening China or weakening Japan. If non-official sources are to be believed, the second step the United States will take will inevitably be related to Australia and the Dutch East Indies, opening the road to China. The reason why Japan acted in Vietnam is likely an important factor. The retaliation is said to be important because Japan's move to reach the Burma Road is crucial, as Britain is waiting for the rainy season to pass to reopen the road. Furthermore, the Japanese government has received a report that the Burma agreement expires on October 18, at which time Britain will take action. (Taichung News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Issues Statement: Concessions are Temporary in Nature</h3>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the Vietnam issue, French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently delivered a speech explaining the agreement established between France and Japan in Hanoi yesterday, as well as its negotiations. He stated that various concessions are only temporary in nature. He said: "After the Franco-German armistice agreement was signed, the former Governor-General of Vietnam, General Catroux, complied with Japan's request to seal the Vietnamese border. By July 10 of this year, Lieutenant General Nishihara, director of the Japanese inspection team, again requested the Vietnamese authorities to allow Japanese troops to pass through Tonkin to Yunnan, China, but the Vietnamese authorities did not accept it. On August 2, the Japanese government sent a memorandum to the French Embassy in Japan, reiterating its previous request and seeking to use the airspace within Vietnam. Although this memorandum was not an ultimatum, a firm refusal would inevitably create a serious situation that would endanger the sovereignty of Vietnam. Therefore, the French government agreed to negotiate with Japan in a calm atmosphere and requested Japan to provide assurances that it had no territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia. The Japanese side immediately replied that it was willing to find a basis for a satisfactory agreement between the two countries. Thus, negotiations began and, on August 30, an agreement was reached whereby Japan formally provided a promise to respect French interests in the Far East (including the territorial integrity of Vietnam), while the French government recognized Japan's superior position in the Far East and signed a military and economic agreement with Japan. Among these, the economic agreement stipulated that Japan would enjoy a more superior position than other countries in Vietnam, while the military agreement was not established until August 22. During the course of the negotiations, the French government notified the governments of all relevant countries of the progress, including the United States. In short, France's concessions to Japan in Vietnam, providing certain military facilities to the Japanese side, are temporary in nature. Their effective period ends when the Sino-Japanese War concludes." (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the Vietnam issue, difficulties arose during the final stages of negotiations between French and Japanese representatives in Hanoi. The authorities here felt quite uneasy for a time. The agreement that has now been established has greatly relieved both sides. During the negotiations, this region earnestly hoped for a satisfactory solution, but was always concerned that unexpected incidents would occur locally, hindering the progress of the negotiations. Indeed, French and Japanese soldiers exchanged gunfire in Dong Dang. Fortunately, this occurred after both sides signed the agreement, so it was calmed down after an explanation. According to the agreement signed by both sides, Japan recognizes France's full sovereignty in Vietnam, while France recognizes Japan's special situation in the Far East. In short, with British troops already withdrawn from Chinese territory, and the United States' concern for the Far East being more theoretical than practical, France is clearly isolated. Its concessions to Japan were forced upon it. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<h3>de Gaulle Leads British Fleet to Bombard Dakar Port in West Africa; Demand for Surrender Rejected, Action Immediately Taken; French Say British Troops Attempted to Land Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>London - General de Gaulle, accompanied by a British fleet loaded with Free French and British troops, suddenly arrived off the coast of Dakar, the capital of French West Africa, yesterday. He issued an ultimatum to the French authorities in the area, demanding the surrender of Dakar. After the ultimatum was rejected, fierce fighting broke out in French West Africa. The British fleet, consisting of two battleships, four cruisers, six auxiliary cruisers, and a number of destroyers, immediately began destroying onshore fortifications when the French authorities rejected the ultimatum. According to an official statement issued by Belgium, this British action was to prevent the Germans from controlling Dakar, and because three German cruisers and three destroyers had recently sailed from Toulon to that port. After receiving news of the British fleet's attack in Vichy, French leader Pétain immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting. After the meeting, he simply announced that France would meet force with force. It is now heard that the Pétain government has ordered the French West African authorities to fire back at the British ships bombarding Dakar. Although the British action has aroused anger in Vichy and triggered a retaliatory warning, Foreign Minister Baudouin told foreign reporters that this attack is not the beginning of a war and that France will not declare war on Britain.</p>
<p>The British Information Department issued a statement on developments outside Dakar, stating that it has recently been reported that the Germans are trying to control Dakar, and that the French fleet cannot leave Toulon without German permission, which proves that the Germans are indeed planning to control the port. General de Gaulle, seeing the opposition of the people of West Africa to Vichy's policy of surrendering to Germany, and declaring his support for Free France, decided to lead the Free French forces to Dakar to assist the people who support his position. De Gaulle arrived off Dakar on the morning of Sunday and called on the French to return to the banner of Free France. This move seems to have been resisted, but the situation is not yet fully clear. De Gaulle's Free French forces are accompanied by British troops to provide full assistance.</p>
<p>Dakar is the seat of the central government of French West Africa. French Guinea, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, French Sudan, Mauritania, and the Dakar region each have a governor, all of whom are under the control of the Governor-General of Dakar. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Dakar - British troops attempted to land in the port twice last night but were repelled. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>de Gaulle Sends Emissaries to Land and Persuade Surrender</h3>
<p>London - The Vichy report that the British attempted to land in or near Dakar is completely unfounded. General de Gaulle's office in London issued a statement saying that after de Gaulle arrived in Dakar, he sent two emissaries by motorboat, flying both the Tricolore and a white flag, unarmed to make contact. They were fired upon by the Dakar naval authorities, seriously injuring both. De Gaulle then attempted to have his troops land peacefully, but the Dakar authorities fired on them again, killing and wounding several. De Gaulle, unwilling to participate in internecine fighting among the French, led his troops and ships to withdraw. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Emergency Meeting Decides to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Vichy - The cabinet held an emergency meeting regarding the British fleet's bombardment of Dakar, French West Africa. Head of State Pétain, Cabinet Associate Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, Navy Minister Darlan, Army Minister Huntziger, and Colonial Minister Platon all attended. It was immediately decided to resist the aggression, and the army and navy were immediately ordered to return fire.</p>
<p>Vichy - Head of State Pétain telegraphed French West African Governor Boisson this morning, saying, "Your Excellency bravely resisted the rebellion and British aggression. The garrison of Dakar, under your command, has shown courage and loyalty to the motherland, setting an example. The entire nation is proud of this, and I send this telegram to commend you and express my complete trust." (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Vichy Government Communiqué Condemns de Gaulle's Actions</h3>
<p>On one hand, the French Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué stating, "When the British fleet, carrying British troops, arrived off the coast of Dakar, de Gaulle, the head of the 'French National Committee' in London, was also on board. He brazenly sent an ultimatum to the local authorities, demanding surrender. After the local authorities refused, the British fleet immediately opened fire. In the past, some people thought that de Gaulle's willingness to be used by the British was only to continue fighting against our past enemies. However, according to the current facts, his goal is not so simple, for he is simply acting as a cat's paw, leading foreign troops to attack his compatriots. Those who did not recognize de Gaulle as a traitor should now be awakened." (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>France Retaliates Against Britain by Bombing Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Vichy - 120 French aircraft from Vichy Morocco bombed Gibraltar this morning in retaliation for the British fleet's bombardment of Dakar, but this news has not yet been officially confirmed. Vichy expects Britain to take severe action against French colonies in Africa, but it is not yet known whether British troops will attempt to land in Dakar. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>The Struggle for the Gateways of French Colonies Has Begun</h3>
<p>Vichy - Government officials here acknowledged today that the struggle for the gateways of the world's largest French colonies is now underway. After the French West African authorities rejected the ultimatum, the British fleet bombarded the Dakar fortress, showing its courage to occupy this vast French colony. Formal hostilities between France and Britain have now begun, with six French warships and land batteries now answering British fire. This war is the third conflict between the formerly allied countries of Britain and France. General de Gaulle, commander of the "Free French forces" who are still fighting Germany, personally issued an ultimatum to West African Governor Boisson yesterday, demanding surrender. Since France surrendered, this has been one of the most moving scenes in the European war. De Gaulle, on the flagship of the attacking African fleet, demanded that the Dakar authorities join him and fight Germany alongside Britain. De Gaulle asked the Dakar authorities not to forget the common cause of Britain and France once fighting Germany together, and said that this cause has not diminished. De Gaulle's ultimatum was rejected, and the British immediately launched an attack. The Vichy government's cabinet held an emergency meeting, vowing to respond to Britain with a "tit-for-tat" retaliatory policy, while French Foreign Minister Baudouin said that France did not want to declare war on Britain, but also hinted that France would retaliate against Britain in other ways. Military observers here acknowledge that the British attack on Dakar in French West Africa is a bold plan. If successful, it will have a profound impact on the outcome of the war. French West Africa is the main foundation of the French economic structure, with an area of 1,815,768 square miles. This vast land stretches west from the Atlantic Ocean, across Africa, and east to British Egyptian Sudan, north from Morocco, Algeria, and the southern desert border of Italian Libya, and south to the Gulf of Guinea and the undetermined borders of French Equatorial Africa. The entire area is formed by the merger of seven colonies. If the British occupy this vast colony, it will eventually become a threat to the Italian army in Libya, as the British can send two armies to attack the west side of the Italian-occupied area. The British Egyptian Sudan, now threatened by the Italian army from Abyssinia, can also be protected. The general consensus here is that Britain hopes that de Gaulle will persuade the West African authorities to surrender, but if persuasion fails, it is also prepared to use force. If the French authorities finally decide to obey the de Gaulle government, then the conquest of French West Africa will not be necessary and will be cancelled. The entire population of the colony is 16 million, including 26,000 Europeans. The capital of Dakar has a population of about 40,000, protected by a naval base and fortress.

<h3>Italian Troops Attacking Egypt Advance East in Two Routes; Roads Rugged, Difficult to March; Italian Transport Units Bombed</h3>
<p>Cairo - British Headquarters issued a communiqué last night stating that there were no changes in the Western Desert battle situation. Sidi Hanash and Matruh were bombed by enemy aircraft, with negligible material damage and two injuries. Mufpu on the island of Cyprus was also attacked by enemy aircraft, without any damage. Regarding the Italian army's invasion of Libya, detailed reports have now been received, learning that the enemy army, after repairing the road on the Lower Solum slope destroyed by British engineers, began advancing along the coast under the cover of sand dunes. The second route advanced along the slope of the Tongzhu Khalifa pass (fifteen miles from Solum), but the Italian army suffered heavy casualties when trying to descend the slope. The British army had blown up the pass when retreating, so the Italian army had to get out of their vehicles and descend the rugged road one after another. The British advance troops used Bren machine guns to fiercely strafe them, then shifted their positions to resist the enemy army. Before the Italian army attacked, the enemy artillery at Bardia, with the help of observation from Gapso, fired accurately. There are relatively few enemy troops fighting on the front lines, because tens of thousands of troops must maintain their extremely difficult transportation lines. In order to avoid coastal marching congestion, the Italian motorized units advanced along another coastal road south of Boek Boek, and must pass through a very difficult road in the desert to meet with the coastal Italian army. The mountains and sand dunes are densely packed in the southern desert, like a maze, which is not suitable for marching. Taking risks will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, the enemy must now maintain two transportation lines that are getting longer and longer. The Italian army is now only in the Sidi Barrani area, which is a slope near the sea in the inland desert. According to news here, the Italian claim that they captured a large British armored force is not true. The British army systematically struck the enemy army, while their own casualties were very minimal. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A recent British Air Force communiqué stated that British aircraft recently attacked the main supply base of the Italian army in Africa, the port of Benghazi, with great success. One ship in the port was hit, and the warehouse was also hit and caught fire. Yesterday, the Italian aircraft at the Mannasi airfield and the Italian motorized transport team concentrated near Sidi Barrani were also bombed by British aircraft, and many trucks were hit and destroyed. Malta was attacked by Italian aircraft on Sunday, and ten houses in a village were destroyed. However, Aden was attacked twice without any damage. The South African British Air Force is also very active, attacking El-Khadra and Dimo. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Egyptian Authorities Arrest Many Italian Overseas Residents</h3>
<p>Cairo - The Egyptian authorities here began rounding up all Italian overseas residents in Cairo yesterday as a precaution. About 4,000 people have been detained in detention camps, and the same method is now being adopted throughout Egypt. The overseas report that martial law has been declared throughout Egypt is unfounded. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Balkan Conference to Be Held in Rome; Turkey Not to Be Invited; Greece to Be Sacrificed and Allowed to Be Slaughtered; The Construction of the Macedonian State Will Be Brought Up Again</h3>
<p>London - According to Swiss telecommunications, after the meeting between German and Italian diplomatic authorities, the issue of convening a Balkan conference in Rome has arisen. It is said that Turkey is not intended to be invited, and only representatives from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece will be invited. A Reuters diplomatic reporter said that Mussolini is likely to imitate Hitler's previous actions of convening the heads of government of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania to listen to reconciliation orders. Mussolini has the same idea in mind, and clearly wants Greece to follow in the footsteps of Romania and be allowed to be slaughtered. Today, the Italian newspapers not only encourage Bulgaria's desire to find a port on the Aegean Sea, but have also long supported the proposition of establishing another Macedonian state. Bulgaria has not expressed its desire to promote its Aegean Sea demands at this time, but seems to want to put it on hold until the end of the war, and is reluctant to be used in the Balkan issue. Neither Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, nor Greece support the idea of establishing an independent Macedonian state. Italy can undoubtedly create incidents by using Albania's demands, but the so-called Albanian demands are nothing more than artificial. However, according to the news received in London, it is Germany, not Italy, that wants to bring up the Balkan issue again, because Germany wants to strengthen its ties with Bulgaria.

<h3>Germany and Spain Negotiate Again</h3>
<p>Berlin - Spanish Interior Minister Suner returned to Berlin from the Western Front yesterday. It is reported that Suner will hold talks with the German Foreign Minister again. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to Berlin last night and immediately reported to the Führer Hitler on the progress of the negotiations in Rome. Regarding this matter, Berlin insisted that the scope of the Rome negotiations was very broad, because there were many issues involved in the Italian army's attack on the British fortress in Egypt. Therefore, the Axis talks will continue to follow the development of the war. In the past few days, Spanish newspapers have clearly pointed out the position of Spain in the Axis war and that the policy of the Madrid government has reached a decisive moment. Spanish Interior Minister Suner has now returned to Berlin again, and the negotiations will be restarted. The importance of these negotiations at present cannot be denied. For several days, Italian newspapers have also clearly declared that the Axis powers will not tolerate countries that are still under British influence. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Regarding Spanish Interior Minister Suner's return to Berlin, the "Douins Newspaper" commented that Suner's visit to Berlin was to end the policy of Spain's political isolation. Spain's exclusion from European events is now a thing of the past. Today, Spain is no longer afraid to demand its due rights. Political and press circles here have high expectations for Suner's talks with the German Foreign Minister, and said that once Suner visits Rome, it will be a turning point in Spanish history.

<h3>Turkish Ambassador to Italy Returns Home to Report; Ambassador to Soviet Germany Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>Istanbul - Turkish Ambassador to Italy Regip has now returned to the Turkish capital to report everything to the government. Political figures here speculate that Regip's return home to report is related to the Italian army's attack on Egypt. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Surenberg's return to Berlin, according to German officials, the ambassador had long intended to return to the German capital, but there will be no special importance in the political discussions during his return.

<h3>US Will Soon Send Navy to British Territory</h3>
<p>Washington - Authoritative sources here disclosed today that the United States will soon send the Navy to the US naval and air force bases, which were recently obtained from Britain in the Western Hemisphere. This detachment will be supplemented later by naval and air force teams from the US Navy. At the same time, the authorities ordered Congress to quickly pass a bill to increase the peacetime naval force to at least 50,000. President Luo recently ordered that the total number of the US Navy should be increased to 38,600, but after recent consideration by the Army, it is known that this number is not enough. (International News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>US Fleet to Be Transferred to the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Honolulu - Reliable sources said that the thirty American warships that returned to the mainland for rest, if they do not stay on the West Coast, will be transferred to the Atlantic. Two cruisers will also go to the Atlantic to meet other US naval teams. It is said that no matter how the navy is transferred, the strength of the US main fleet will not be affected.

<h3>Gandhi Visits the Viceroy, Indian Situation Expected to Ease</h3>
<p>Wardha – It is outwardly reported that Gandhi is going to Simla on Friday to meet with the Viceroy to ascertain the Indian government's attitude towards the resolution passed by the National Congress last week. This resolution determines one of the methods to withdraw the conditional proposal to cooperate with Britain in the war. Radical factions of the National Congress Party hope to adopt a non-violent policy as a cover for anti-war activities, thereby provoking a split with the government. However, most conservatives believe that Gandhi's trip may lead to a compromise, and some even hope that after Gandhi meets with the Viceroy, members of the National Congress in the provincial legislative councils will be reinstated.

<h3>British Air Force Counterattacks Germany, Heavily Bombing Berlin, Inflicting Severe Damage, Bombing City Center for Four Hours, Fires Erupting Everywhere, Red Light Illuminating the Sky</h3>
<p>London – The Air Ministry announced that last night, British bombers conducted an all-night air raid on Berlin and its surrounding military targets, on a scale unprecedented in history, inflicting very heavy damage on the enemy. The targets selected by the British aircraft included the Lanksdorf railway station and several coal yards, the Western power station, the gas plant, and the Brandenburg automobile factory, all of which were severely damaged. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Last night and this morning, British bombers, as the German newspapers stated, wanting to avenge the killing of British people by German planes, braved the unprecedented barrage of anti-aircraft fire and carried out the longest air raid since the war began, causing fires and casualties here. The British bombers came in large formations, penetrating the fierce anti-aircraft fire, from 11:23 PM to 3:10 AM (10:10 AM Shanghai time). Even though the city's anti-aircraft fire was as dense as a string of pearls, British planes still dropped bombs and incendiary bombs. After the all-clear signal, two large fires were still burning in the warehouse and factory areas of northern Berlin. The alarm also sounded in Stettin at midnight, but details of the air raid have not yet been received here. The anti-aircraft fire in Berlin during the raid was extremely terrifying, unprecedented, with all the guns seemingly firing at the same time and continuously from start to finish. (United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin – An air raid alert was issued in Berlin after midnight yesterday. Many British planes invaded the city's airspace and broke through the city's defenses, dropping high-explosive bombs and many incendiary bombs. (Haitong Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Last night, Berlin initially suffered the most intense attack by British bombers. From last night until this morning, British aircraft groups dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs in the center of Berlin for a total of four hours. Many large fires are still burning in several industrial areas of Berlin. British aircraft penetrated Berlin's air defenses without much difficulty. Although the dense anti-aircraft batteries outside Berlin formed a terrifying network of fire, they were still broken through by British aircraft. German fighters encountered British aircraft over Berlin, and British fighters fought hard to protect their bombers. The outcome has not yet been announced. The sounds of explosions were frequent and did not stop all night. The entire Berlin area was illuminated by fire. The extent of the damage will probably not be made public immediately. (International News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Aftonbladet's Berlin correspondent reports that the Berlin authorities are not allowing foreign correspondents to inspect the damage caused by last night's British bombing. The authorities only stated that "no military targets were hit," but many houses in the southeastern parts of the city were bombed, and many residents were killed or injured. The intensity of this air raid was unprecedented in Berlin. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry released a statement last night stating that all British aircraft that carried out large-scale attacks in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France the previous night and this morning returned safely. An important aluminum factory in Ruda, northeast of Dresden, Germany, was bombed and caught fire. Several nearby railways were also hit. Large formations of British bombers also attacked various locations, including Vlissingen, Antwerp, Dunkirk, Ostend, Zeebrugge, Calais, Le Havre, and Brest, with considerable success.

<h3>Germany Uses New Type of Giant Aircraft, London Continues to be Raided, Small Squadrons Break Through City Defenses, British Claim 11 German Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>London – This morning, hundreds of German aircraft swarmed across the Channel, but the British put up a fierce and effective resistance, eventually driving them back. Only scattered German aircraft reached London, but these few planes circled over London for a long time, bombing the city center and suburbs, causing several fires. Other German aircraft scattered to various corners of Britain and Wales to bomb. According to British reports, most of the German aircraft that were turned back outside London dropped their bombs into the sea. Among the German aircraft that raided London was a giant new type of bomber, whose size was unprecedented here, causing crowds to gather and look up to watch. (International News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>London – Today, the intensity of British anti-aircraft fire reached its peak. All German aircraft that penetrated London individually were repelled, and most German aircraft were also forced to drop bombs on the outskirts of London in order to escape quickly. After the all-clear signal this morning, it was reported that at least two German aircraft were shot down inside the London area. However, at 8:40 AM this morning (4:40 PM Shanghai time), as London residents were heading to work, the alarm sounded again. German aircraft were reported to have dropped bombs in the central, northern, and southwestern districts of London, mostly time bombs. (United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry stated that yesterday German aircraft desperately attacked civilians in several coastal towns in Sussex, with Eastbourne being the worst hit, and houses were damaged, but casualties were light. Shortly after noon yesterday, a German aircraft flew to London and was hit by anti-aircraft fire. It fled quickly without dropping any bombs. In the evening, a large formation of German aircraft, mostly fighters, flew over the British coast but did not penetrate inland. It is now known that a total of eleven German aircraft were shot down yesterday, and the British also lost eleven fighters, but seven pilots were safe. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<h3>Dangerous Situation in the Far East, US and Soviet Union Plan Cooperation, Soviet Union Raises Several Demands, Secret Talks Underway</h3>
<p>Washington – According to government official sources received by International News Service, the Soviet Union has recently made various political and economic demands to the US government as the basis for establishing a closer and more sincere relationship between the two countries. The Soviet Union's sudden call for assistance and desire for closer ties with the United States has divided President Roosevelt's cabinet. It is reported that some cabinet members hope to cooperate with the Soviet Union, while others do not want to cooperate. An official told International News Service that closely guarded talks between Soviet Ambassador to the US, Maxim Litvinov, and US State Department officials (including Secretary of State Hull) have been ongoing for two months. Authoritative sources say that whether the US will grant the Soviet Union's demands has divided the US cabinet. The official source reported that some cabinet members, represented by Secretary of State Hull, feel that the Soviet Union's demands are not reasonable, while Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Interior Secretary Ickes believe that the United States can provide the Soviet Union with practical benefits in exchange for a large-scale US-Soviet deal and political cooperation in the Far East. The source also reported that the Soviet Ambassador to the US has made the following important concessions to the US: (1) Selling two sets of machinery worth $25,000,000 to the Soviet Union; (2) Selling or leasing two fleets of oil tankers to the Soviet Union; (3) Sending US experts to the Soviet Union to supervise the construction of manufacturing plants and produce aviation gasoline; (4) Giving preferential treatment to Russian expatriates in the US. The above issues have become the focus of the talks, which are still ongoing. Unofficial observers here say that some US Navy officers and staff in the State Department's Far Eastern Division support further cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union as a strategy to counter the expansion of Japanese power in the Pacific.

<h3>Incident of Japanese Residents Arrested in Singapore, Japanese Side Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Regarding the arrest of six Japanese residents by the British authorities in Singapore, a telegram from the Japanese consul in Singapore reports that two of them are women and four are men. The British authorities arrested them on suspicion of espionage. According to the Japanese consul, the British entered the Japanese consulate general, arrested one staff member, searched his room, demanded the handover of certain secret documents, and opened the safe. The Japanese consul immediately lodged a protest and sealed the safe. The two Japanese women arrested were bank employees, and the others were a hotel owner, a hotel employee, and an employee of a Japanese shipping company. (Haitong News, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese government has instructed the Japanese Consul General in Singapore to demand that the British authorities immediately release the six Japanese residents arrested at the end of last week. Semi-official sources claim that the Japanese government will lodge a serious protest with the London authorities regarding this matter. The Japanese people believe that the British police's intrusion into the Japanese consulate general and the looting of the safe is not only a violation of international law but also a serious insult to Japan. At a time when it is rumored that Singapore will be placed under American administration, the arrest of six Japanese residents has led some to believe that it may cause serious consequences.

<h3>American Press Tycoon Discusses Far East Crisis, Japanese Southward Policy Needs to be Crushed</h3>
<p>New York – Roy Howard, Director of the "Howard Newspaper Chain" in the United States, wrote an article here yesterday stating that the gradual development of the Far East affects the future of the United States more than the British war. Howard recently returned to New York after a 30,000-mile air trip to the Far East. He said that the possibility of a Japanese-American war is now seen as increasing. He said, "Based on any calm reason and logic, a Japanese-American war may be too fantastic, but scholars who are well-versed in the study of Japanese-American relations have changed their judgment and believe that at this point, there is indeed a possibility of a serious conflict between Japan and the United States. This conflict may not be inevitable, but the only way to avoid it is for the US government to publicly announce our Far East policy and for the newspapers and people to take a realistic understanding of our inevitable position in the Pacific. Unless Japan's southward policy toward European colonies is stopped early, it is predictable that there will be an inevitable disaster in the Far East. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>

<h3>US to Close Taipei Consulate</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Today, news here about the dispute involving a Japanese employee of the North American consulate states that the United States may close the Taipei consulate and demand that Japan take the same measures for its consulate in the Philippines. It is reported that the Taipei Court of Appeal has rejected the retrial of the case of Matsuo, the secretary in charge of the North American consulate in Taipei, for leaking military secrets. If so, then Matsuo must accept the three-year prison sentence imposed by the trial court. When Matsuo was arrested a few months ago, the United States protested to Japan, as Matsuo was accused of leaking military secrets, and the US protested because Matsuo was falsely accused. Regarding the closure of the consulate, many government officials are in favor of it. (United Press, 24th)</p>
<h3>Decisions of the Executive Yuan, Measures for Levying Transit Tax on Local Goods, and Passing of Proposal to Increase Postal Rates</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Executive Yuan held its 483rd meeting on the morning of the 24th. All ministers attended and paid close attention to the current situation in Vietnam. The meeting discussed in detail the military and diplomatic aspects and decided to proceed with the steps that had been decided upon repeatedly. Other decisions are listed below: (1) The Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal to levy a transit tax on local goods: 1. The district offices with collection authorities will continue to be responsible for collecting transit taxes by customs. 2. In provinces where customs offices were originally established, the transit tax will be collected by the cargo inspection branch office before the withdrawn customs checkpoints are restored. 3. In places where there are no customs checkpoints, the transit tax will be temporarily collected by the cargo inspection office before customs offices are established. Decision: Passed. (2) Proposal for the start-up costs of the Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Committee. Decision: Passed. (3) The Ministry of Transportation proposed that postal expenses have increased significantly since the start of the war and requested a reasonable increase in postal rates to avoid losses.

Decision: Passed. (Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Since the outbreak of the war, mail between the rear and the occupied areas must be routed through international routes. According to the regulations of the International Postal Union, postal, waterway, or land transit fees must be paid to each transit country (60 centimes per kilogram for waterway or land, or 3 yuan in national currency). The postal transport tools in various parts of the rear, in addition to the self-operated automobile transport on the main routes, require the purchase of fuel and parts. The cost of hiring mules, horses, and vehicles is also several times higher than before the war. The transportation cost has increased significantly. Taking the letters between Shanghai and Chongqing as an example, the freight per kilogram must be paid 6-7 yuan, and the average postal rate is only 3 yuan. The losses for mail with lower fees are even greater. In order to make up for the losses and support the postal service, the Ministry of Transportation submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan meeting and it was approved to modify the current postal rates. The new rates are as follows: ordinary letters (every 20 grams), 4 cents within the city, 8 cents outside the city; postcards, 2 cents within the city, 4 cents outside the city; registration fee, 13 cents within the city, 23 cents outside the city; express registration fee, 20 cents within the city, 20 cents outside the city; express fee, 8 cents within the city, 8 cents outside the city. Other fees, such as collection of payment on delivery, insurance, safe deposit boxes, evidence of letters, and registration receipts, will also be slightly increased. However, the fees for newspapers will remain the same. The date of implementation of the above revised postal rates will be subject to the official announcement by the General Post Office.

<h3>Air Raid Shelters in Chongqing, Miraculous Uses, Officials Receive Guests Inside, Reporters Carry Out Work</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – News from Chongqing states that the best time and place for journalists to meet with Chongqing government officials is in the air raid shelters during air raids. Government officials are usually too busy to have long talks with journalists, but the several hours in the air raid shelter are a good opportunity to chat with news personnel. Therefore, there are often meetings scheduled as "Please come to see me at the XXX air raid shelter during the air raid". At present, part of the activities of the wartime capital, due to the frequent bombing by Japanese aircraft, are carried out in air raid shelters. Newspapers and news agencies were the first to utilize the air raid shelters. Equipment such as typesetting and printing machines have been placed in the basement, with electric lights and fans. Typesetting and printing are carried out in the shelter, while the editorial office remains on the ground. However, as soon as the alarm sounds, the chief editors quickly bring their manuscripts and writing materials to the basement, writing and editing as usual under electric or kerosene lamps. Thus, the people of Chongqing can read the newspapers the next morning. Wireless communication operators bring their transceivers to the basement when the bombers approach. If the antennas are not damaged, they can exchange news with various parts of the world. During air raids, important personnel from various offices are stationed in the shelters to handle "emergency" matters. Whenever the "red ball" is hoisted, reporting that Japanese aircraft are approaching, all important documents and equipment are moved to the shelter. The shelters have wooden "ceilings" and "floors", as well as desks, chairs, stationery, electric lights, fans, drinks, and food. Some underground offices even have telephones, sofas, chairs, and wireless radios. Even if the Japanese aircraft bomb fiercely, most people can live and work there for several hours.

<h3>European War Afterthoughts (10) (3) - Fragments of Hitler's Private Life</h3>
<p>Hitler's private life is not only unknown, but also unknowable. His mountain villa "Eagle's Nest" in Berchtesgaden is inaccessible to anyone except a few trusted confidants. Even those qualified to be guests there are bound by "Visitor Instructions," which forbid them from divulging even a single word about the situation in Hitler's private residence or the daily life of their leader; otherwise, they would be severely punished. However, as fate would have it, there was a maid named Pauline Kohler (23 years old, slender, and quite attractive) in Hitler's villa. Her parents and young husband were successively arrested by the secret police. Overwhelmed with grief and indignation, she inevitably offended the authorities and was also arrested and sent to a concentration camp. After being released in 1934, she worked as a maid in the home of a National Socialist official. Due to her excellent performance, her master recommended her to serve in Hitler's villa three years later. From then on, the dictator's private life could not escape Pauline's watchful eyes, and she also learned many anecdotes from others close to Hitler. In the spring of 1939, she tried every means to escape the "forbidden palace" and, after countless hardships with her husband, fled Germany, traveled through Europe, and went to America. As a result, Hitler's mysterious private life was revealed to the world by this beautiful maid who had experienced it firsthand. Pauline's writings were initially published serially in the American weekly "Liberty," and have now been printed as a single volume. Excerpts are translated below for the amusement of readers:</p>
<p>Although Hitler is a vegetarian, he is very particular about his food, and everything is very exquisite. If there is even a slight error in the cooking, the chief steward, Audu, Sharibon, would be terrified. There are four chefs in the kitchen, all from famous Berlin restaurants. There is also a renowned European vegetarian expert, a Hungarian named Rodi Fan You, who supervises them. He is the only foreigner in Hitler's villa, has now become a German citizen, and receives very generous treatment.</p>
<p>Hitler gets up very late, not eating breakfast until after ten o'clock, sometimes as late as eleven. He eats very little for breakfast, just a glass of fresh orange juice and a few slices of bread with butter. He likes butter very much and eats half a pound every day. Farmers in Berchtesgaden must supply this fresh butter every day.</p>
<p>He has a very good appetite for lunch and always eats a lot of the first course, vegetable soup. The main course is fish. Hitler is not completely vegetarian, but he does not eat meat. He never tires of eating trout with butter sauce. The fish plate also contains some fried potatoes. After eating the fish, the waiter brings a large plate of assorted nuts, which are the only things he peels himself.</p>
<p>He does not touch any kind of wine, but sometimes he drinks some "substitute beer," which is much lighter than regular beer. It is only the same as real beer in color. He likes to drink coffee, brewed very strong and very sweet. He always drinks sixteen large cups of it.</p>
<p>Dinner consists of at least six courses, which is only the case when there are guests during the day. Hitler eats little, just lettuce, potatoes, and his favorite sweets. When he was of humble status, he often went to the Kaiserhof or Adlon Hotel in Berlin every afternoon to eat a large amount of cream pastries. On the weekly menu, this kind of dessert is listed for at least four days.</p>
<p>Guests are free to drink wine at meals, but this wine must be produced in Germany. Göring finds this most troubling, as he has a very sophisticated wine cellar at home, filled with many fine French and Italian wines.</p>
<p>It is absolutely forbidden to smoke in front of Hitler, especially in the rooms he is about to enter. He hates the smell of smoke the most. His love of sweets is like an ordinary person's love of smoking. He eats several pounds every week. Once, I (Pauline referring to herself) heard him say to Göring, "These sweets can greatly improve my ability to handle affairs."</p>
<p>When it comes to dressing, Hitler can be said to be one of the least particular people in the world. However, he does have a personal tailor named Edger Gross. Because he is unwilling to let the tailor properly measure him, his clothes are always ill-fitting. As the supreme leader of Germany, he can be said to be one of the people with the fewest clothes in the world. All of his clothing consists of only a few sets of uniforms, five sets of regular clothes, and two sets of evening dress. But even these few sets of clothes seem like a lot of trouble to his attendants.</p>
<p>His regular clothes only come in two colors, black and dark gray. He pays no attention to how he wears them. Sometimes he curls up in a chair at will, and in less than an hour or two, the knee part of his pants becomes swollen like a lantern. Also, his clothes pockets are often filled with sweets and many papers. In short, well-made clothes from the tailor are guaranteed to go out of shape within a few days of being worn by him.</p>
<p>In fact, he believes that a man who is particular about his clothes is unpromising. Göring, who loves to collect uniforms, is often ridiculed by him. Hitler feels very comfortable and fond of the stormtrooper uniforms of brown shirts, shorts, and jackboots.</p>
<p>Hitler has suffered from insomnia for a long time. Not only can he not get up before ten o'clock in the morning, but he also does nothing until after lunch. Even in the afternoon, he first meets with political figures or discusses everything with friends. It is not until eight-thirty after dinner that he sits behind his desk and begins to work.</p>
<p>The first step in his work is to browse the summaries of newspapers from various countries around the world. These summaries are compiled and translated by a dozen or so newspaper secretaries who are proficient in various languages. Some outsiders say that the newspaper materials Hitler reads must first be reviewed and selected by Ribbentrop or Goebbels before being presented, which is not true. However, this group of newspaper secretaries has their own considerations, either deleting or retaining, all of which have been carefully considered, and it is nothing more than "taking precautions against fire." You think, if there is a place in the newspaper that satirizes this German leader, would Hitler be willing to slap himself in the face? When he sees cartoons or satirical poems in British and American newspapers, he immediately gets extremely angry. In particular, the works of the British cartoonist Low are most likely to anger him.</p>
<p>After reading the newspaper summaries, he calls his regular secretaries into the room. These secretaries work in shifts and begin to draft. He dictates words, which they record. He speaks very quickly and shouts loudly, as if he is giving a speech to the public. The grammar and sentences he uses are often very poor and must be carefully revised and polished before they are copied and issued. Such dictation of confidential matters and drafting of official documents for officials in various parts of the country takes one and a half hours.</p>
<p>However, regarding Hitler's physical condition, I learned it from his male servant, Fleisch Label, and the deputy housekeeper, Elsa Hostphen. As for them, they heard it from Hitler's sister, Paula Hitler. It is said that Hitler's heart is very worrying, and his throat has cancerous symptoms.</p>
<p>When Professor Rabel first decided to operate, he cut off a tumor on his right vocal cord. Whether the first and second decisions were carried out consecutively is not known. Hitler's difficulty in pronunciation is not due to too many speeches, but according to what Hostphen told me, it is indeed well-founded. She said that to remove the painful and swollen vocal cords, one can only cut off the vocal cords, and then cut a strip of fake vocal cords from the leader's own skin and graft it into the throat. Now the risk of cancer in Hitler's throat has passed. Professor Rabel's surgery saved his voice, but Hitler's voice will inevitably become rougher and hoarser. I (Pauline) know that Professor Rabel once recommended Professor Newman, a Viennese surgeon who had operated on the Duke of Windsor, but Hitler rejected him because he was Jewish.

<h3>Yuan Lvdeng's Word is as Good as Gold - Hope for a Turnaround in the Charity Basketball Challenge - Bailemen Acts Righteously and No Longer Insists - The Battle Against Liangxi Tonight is Postponed</h3>
<p>The once extremely popular charity basketball challenge was caused by the boring jeers of some ignorant spectators, which led to Bailemen's discouragement. After the unfortunate news that it was willing to compensate the four ticket investors and decided to decline the rematch was revealed, the unprecedentedly enthusiastic basketball challenge charity match was suddenly interrupted, and enthusiastic fans were also unable to enjoy it. Charitable people had no way to relieve the suffering. After Yuan Lvdeng took on the role of mediator and urged Bailemen to reluctantly do its best, in addition to sending Pan Hongding, the general manager of the hospital, to persuade them the day before yesterday, he also sent a personal letter to Bailemen yesterday to encourage them to complete the task. Now, the Bailemen authorities have deeply understood the great intentions of all parties' urging and the supervision of the public opinion circles, and seem to no longer insist, and there is great hope for a turnaround. They have also decided to formally reply to Elder Yuan today, but will not express their opinions until the reply is published. It is expected that there will be a satisfactory solution. However, the battle against Liangxi tonight has been postponed by the organizers due to factual reasons. After that, it will be decided after Bailemen formally expresses its attitude. If this matter can be resolved satisfactorily, not only will the charity not be interrupted, but more than 600 orphans will also benefit greatly. I hope that the audience will deeply understand the hard work and dedication of the participants in the competition and will no longer engage in such boring and undignified actions, so as not to turn enthusiasm into discouragement, and the organizers will be deeply grateful. The letter from Yuan Lvdeng to Bailemen is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yuan Lvdeng's letter to Bailemen</p>
<p>To the gentlemen of the Bailemen basketball team: I am writing to inform you that our Difficult Children's Education Institute has been receiving enthusiastic support and vigorous maintenance for many years of fundraising. I am very grateful for your willingness to work hard and make up for my shortcomings. However, the number of games that have been scheduled this time have already been announced in the newspapers. I beg you to complete the task from beginning to end. I am extremely grateful. (Omitted below) Yuan Lvdeng Seal, September 24,</p>

<h3>Silver Coin Ping Pong Tournament - China Middle Defeats Jincheng - China Storage Wins Sihai</h3>
<p>Four Ping Pong matches were played in the Silver Coin Cup tournament last night. The most intense was the match between China Middle and Jincheng. After the start of the match, the China Middle center showed his prowess and led all the way. Jiang Xiaoshi used both drawing and chopping techniques and won four games in a row, which was outstanding. The Quancheng team faced a strong enemy and did its best, but it was defeated 13 to 6 due to its lack of experience. The match record is as follows:</p>

As a result, China Storage won a complete victory with 13 to another. Sihai suffered a complete defeat. There will still be four matches from 7:00 pm tonight (25th). The order is as follows:</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower - Rumors of Rising Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Twenty-count Double Horse yarn has been hovering around the 1,000 yuan mark for two months. Recently, the market has seen a resurgence of rising prices, and everyone believes that another bull market opportunity has arrived. Therefore, the market since September 18 can be said to have been hovering upwards. The rising momentum has been stronger in the past two days, and the buying interest has been unusually strong. The factors are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The long-circling Hong Kong gang's autumn sales have improved, handling nearly 10,000 bales of coarse and fine yarn, which will be shipped immediately. As a result, the chips on the table are slightly dry, and speculators take the opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, the winning and losing transactions of buying and selling have increased from 2,000 to more than 3,000, which shows a glimpse of the resurgence of speculative minds.</p>
<p>(2) Recently, the foreign exchange rate has entered a quiet path, and the price of gold has also changed little. The yarn and flower departments attached to general silver houses specialize in trading one, five, or ten bales on behalf of customers. Small companies are like mushrooms after a rain. Although the quantity is small, the combined calculation is quite considerable. After the opening of these companies, most people buy more and sell less. As a result, a batch of chips is also absorbed, which is also a positive factor.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese yarn market is strictly controlled, and the fluctuation range of each market is very narrow every day. Speculators lack both skills and interest, and most of them change their principles, change their tastes, and attack the Baima market. Therefore, in the past few days, the Huasha market downstairs has been crowded with people, with no room to insert a foot, and a prosperous scene. Some people also say that the above speculators have no plans to hold for a long time, and taking the opportunistic fieldism is the first priority.</p>
<p>(4) The above situations are all positive factors. However, some people observe that the current commercial situation is more advanced than in the past. The Hong Kong gang's acceptance is strong, and the market is certainly optimistic. However, compared to a week ago, the price of Double Horse yarn has risen by 100 yuan. At this time, various transportation routes are heavily blocked. In addition to the Hong Kong gang's market being accessible for transportation, and the yarn they handle are all designated brands, mostly coarse yarn, other areas such as eastern Zhejiang are still difficult to transport goods. Secondly, the foreign exchange rate is flat, and there is a tendency to relax and lengthen. The Vietnam issue is tight and she, coupled with the fact that there is still a large amount of yarn stored in Shanghai, outside of 300,000 bales, once a reaction change, it is also necessary to guard against. Therefore, a certain bank's Double Horse has been released in large quantities. (Mountain)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>After the yarn price fell back due to the blockade of cotton yarn sea transportation, it has often hovered around 1,000 yuan, advancing and retreating, with only a few yuan up and down, and often rising and falling suddenly with the gold market. Until yesterday (24th) morning after the market opened, it suddenly rose step by step, from 1,015 yuan (Double Horse Factory single) to 1,028 yuan, 1,038 yuan, and closed at 1,040 yuan. According to the investigation, the reasons for the rising price (1) are that the Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs are moving from quiet to active, and the actual sales are booming; (?) (2) are that the Chinese and foreign cotton entering the concession must be certified and allowed by a certain party; (3) are that the Japanese yarn factories are greatly reducing their work, and some factories have already realized this; if so, the production of cotton yarn will decrease, and the stock of foreign yarn will gradually decrease due to the actual sales launch; (4) are that the products of British yarn factories are all used as military uniform raw materials; (5) are that the inland yarn prices in the southwestern provinces have risen to more than 4,000 yuan per piece (?).) Speculators with floating capital believe that the yarn price is as low as about 1,000 yuan, which is a low plate (?).) In the future, it will definitely stride forward and go straight to the clouds. Therefore, the yarn price is shrouded in the above five kinds of air, and the buying intentions of those who do more are becoming more and more intense. Therefore, the yarn price is forked and soared. But in any case, we must see the sea transport can I smoothly and the actual sales can the awe-inspiring long-term large-scale mobile office for the transfer, I then the yarn price future, will still be more glory and less shame (Long Jusheng)</p>
<h3>Speculation Spreads, Cotton Yarn Soars, Double Horse Price Climbs to $1,032</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm with a slight rise in prices, due to Hong Kong merchants continuously buying shipments, and speculators spreading rumors. These are all bullish factors. They claim foreign merchant stocks are soaring, thus fueling the momentum, with mutual buying creating a temporary shortage of chips on the market, providing sufficient lifting power. The market is gradually rising. Some say the Vietnam issue is also beneficial to buyers, intensifying speculative buying.</p>
<p>The morning opening of yarn was amiable. The price of 20-count Double Horse was $1,014, falling slightly to $1,010. Then, speculators and scalpers rushed in. Although the US dollar exchange rate eased and gold prices fell, there were still more buyers than sellers in the market, driving prices straight up to $1,028 or $1,029. There were rumors in the market that line charts indicated further bullish factors, and buyers remained enthusiastic. It was also reported that Guang merchants traded 1,600 bales, and fellow speculators traded over 3,000 bales. The closing price was $1,032, with a few more dollars of gains thereafter. A statistical total of 4,505 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by $15.50. The amount of yarn bought by various groups is listed below: Fellow merchants: 3,330 bales; Hong Kong: 1,650 bales; Total: 4,505 bales.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Supply Blocked</h3>
<p>The current cotton trade is ordinary, but sentiment is stable, due to the blocked supply of new cotton. However, factory demand is still sluggish.</p>
<p>$262.00</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton $265.00, fellow merchants purchase 400 pieces.</p>
<p>$270.00</p>
<p>White Lo cut $215.00, plus another 100 pieces.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton market prices: In the New York cotton market, prices initially fell slightly in the morning due to speculator selling, but ultimately closed higher by 7-8 "pound sounds" (points) compared to the previous day due to buying by the industry and partly due to rising stock prices on Wall Street. The Indian market was also very active, with yesterday's prices including forecasts rising by a large 4 rupees.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has recently become more active, particularly for long-fiber cotton. However, this type of raw cotton is extremely scarce in the market, overseas shipping and payment are difficult, and factory demand has increased recently, so this type of raw cotton has been quite popular lately. According to industry observations, cotton prices are expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Led by Yarn</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market trended even firmer due to the continued sharp rise in yarn prices and the gradual increase in factory prices. Demand from Subei and Shandong merchants remained strong. Prices of colored cloth, flannel, and heavyweight coarse cloth all rose, by $0.25 to $0.50 per bolt. Gray cloth and fine twill rose by $0.25 per bolt. Over 700 pieces of various goods were traded on this street. Yantai, Qingdao, and Taiziling brokers purchased over 300 bales of heavyweight coarse cloth. Various Subei routes and Nanjing brokers purchased over 10,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, and velvet. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and twill. Transactions by Zhejiang and Fujian brokers were relatively sparse.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Among the white goods, mid-range fine cloth and fine twill saw continued strong real sales, with approximately 1,000 pieces traded. Market sentiment tightened suddenly, with prices rising another $0.50 to $0.60 per bolt. Longtou fine cloth continued to rise by $0.50, closing in the afternoon at $33.40. Tianjin brokers purchased over 300 boxes, increasing the price by $0.02 per yard, closing at $0.95375.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 2,500 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Quiet</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was quiet yesterday. HSBC's listed rates remained stable. The trend in the unofficial British and American exchange markets was static, as operators awaited developments in the Vietnam war. As a result, the situation was dull. In the end, the US dollar closed steady at $5.3125, and the British pound hardened slightly by 0.015625 to 3/8 pence, due to continued unloading of Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Electric Continues to Sell</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, London large bills were up 0.0625 recently and up 0.125 distantly. New York silver prices remained stable. London raw gold was unchanged. Exchange rates were flat for British pound against US dollar and against Shanghai, and unchanged for US dollar against British pound. For US dollar against Shanghai, it contracted by $0.02. The Central Bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained as before. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British gold at 3/8 pence and 4.84375, and the US dollar at $5.3125, both unchanged from the previous close. Although speculators slightly bid up after the opening, outside parties were quite willing to supply, and the market lacked volatility. September US dollar contracts were traded at $5.3125. HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced as up 0.25. Thereafter, Hong Kong Electric came to sell, but outside parties were still happy to absorb it, and the market remained stable. Hong Kong Electric sold to HSBC and other favorable banks spot British gold at 3/8 pence and 4.84375 and 1/2 pence, and this month's US dollar at $5.3125. Around 11:00 AM, due to rumors of a Franco-Japanese conflict and continued selling by Hong Kong Electric, the market showed a slight loosening. Hong Kong Electric sold spot US dollar to HSBC at $5.34375, while spot foreign exchange was traded at 3/8 pence. Afternoon trading was sparse, and the situation was dull and flat. British gold closed at 3/8 pence, and the US dollar at $5.3125.</p>
<p>British Pound Up, US Dollar Unchanged</p>
<p>Post-market trading was lackluster, with a potential for easing. Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold at 3/8 pence to outside parties. Soon, speculators wanted to sell October US dollar contracts at $5.3125, but outside parties were unwilling to absorb it. Until the close, British gold was at 3/8 pence, and the US dollar at $5.3125. October British gold was at 3/8 pence and 4.84375, and the US dollar at $5.28125. As a result, compared to the previous day, British pound was up by 0.015625, while the US dollar was unchanged.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 14th (Tuesday) Telegram: This morning, the exchange market opening showed a fluctuation for British pound and a stability for the US dollar. The Shanghai rates showed generally no change. The openings at 11:30 AM and 2:30 PM were both flat, and there were no rises or falls for any exchange rate.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Pound and US Dollar Both Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 24th (Tuesday) Telegram: This morning, the exchange market opened soft.

Shanghai money returned by $0.25 to $104, "Joint Notes" on the black market continued to rise sharply by $0.75 to $90.85.</p>
<h3>Floating Short Positions Emerge, Gold Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold bullion unofficial market was easier to fall and difficult to rise. Although the Vietnamese authorities yielded to Japan, allowing Japanese troops to pass through, rumors of a renewed Franco-Japanese conflict and reports of joint Anglo-American actions against Japan caused bullish sentiment to hesitate. This, in turn, led to the emergence of general floating accounts, causing prices to fall. The morning initially showed some weakness. First, the silver firms disbursed money, exchanging 20 taels for $6,210, which was a decrease of $13 from the previous day. Subsequently, through absorption by silver firms and exchange dealers, the price rose to $6,235. Then, another exchange dealer and gold firm sold, pushing it back down to within the $6,220 range. However, after that, trading was quiet, fluctuating around $6,220. Around 11:00 AM, the wind picked up sharply. There were strong rumors of a Franco-Japanese conflict, and exchange markets hardened. Silver firms and exchange dealers rushed to sell, plunging it to the $6,200 mark. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a silver firm, yielding $6,185. By noon, sellers had dwindled, and the market stabilized. Silver firms and floating short positions covered, and by closing, the price had returned to $6,203. The afternoon opening was quite good, with exchange dealers raising prices to absorb and pulling up by more than $10, entering a silver firm for 10 taels, for $6,220. Shortly thereafter, a securities firm forcefully sold, and exchange dealers also turned from buying to selling, immediately falling to $6,200. Unexpectedly, the securities firm suddenly stopped selling and began bidding up, causing it to rise again to $6,210. In the end, due to scattered long positions closing and silver firms selling more than they bought, the result was only a closing price of $6,200, continuing to fall $23 from the previous day. The whole day's fluctuation was $50. The selling price of cash firm's own-brand gold was several tens of dollars higher than the bullion price, with the purchase price reduced by $30. The current standard gold price was over $50 lower than the listed gold price, but trading was rare. The exchange price for silver shop jewelry remained unchanged. Datong Heng (Great Harmony Company) still suspended the original price of $640, with prices from New Tong Heng (New Together Company) similar to the previous price, and the purchase price reduced by around $30.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise Sharply, Foreign Stocks Maintain</h3>
<p>The trend in the securities unofficial market was even stronger yesterday. The enthusiasm of the public and the intensity of buying were unprecedented. The investment interest of various groups is gradually becoming enthusiastic, with the narrowing of discounts as solid proof. The looseness and excess of funds in the market and the lack of destination for idle capital make the absorption of public bonds the only outlet. Because they have both very high interest and the profit of unexpected lottery wins, the number of new buyers in the market is increasing daily. Yesterday, the opening in the morning was slightly weak, but after entering, Lianhe, Hongda, Yongkang, Lianxing, and other companies absorbed enthusiastically, and market prices gradually turned upward. Tongkang slightly unloaded, and Renchang, Zhongyi, Xinchang, and others also sold. The midday close was slightly better by $0.10 to $0.20. In the afternoon, Hengfu had a larger buying appetite, widely acquiring A, C, and E types. For a time, buyers were continuous, and Jiufu, Tongshun, Lemao, Lianhe, Hongda, and Yongkang successively purchased. The majority were supplied by Tongkang, and a minority were sold by Lianyi, Runli, and Lichang. Market sentiment was extremely strong, with Type A approaching $5, Type B already exceeding $8, and Type D, the cheapest in the market, also seeing a trading price of $54.70. Trading is gradually becoming prosperous, with market prices ultimately rising by $0.55 to $0.70. The total transaction volume was over $1.6 million. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 100 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded at a price of $24.25.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the strong opening of the stock market of various industries exceeded the expectations of most people. However, news of a new conflict between Vietnam, France, and Japan suddenly intensified the trend of profit-taking, ultimately preventing this strong momentum from lasting long. The maintenance of prices during the decline was undeniable. In the final bullish trend, the long side clearly has an excessive position. These stocks will naturally need to be "straightened" when necessary, but if the short side can develop smoothly, given the current loose financial conditions in Shanghai, it is undoubtedly not difficult for the market to continue to be optimistic.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Tuesday) Telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British commercial company stocks remained flat. Only the Gula-Klim Rubber stock fell by 7.5 pence, with the price at 13 shillings and 9 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Food: The Vietnam Incident Is Serious, But Fails to Excite the Rice Market</h3>
<p>--Foreign Rice Arrives Endlessly, Japonica Rice Inventory Is Not Thin--</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the foreign rice market was again manipulated by speculative hoarders. The development of the Vietnam issue was sufficient as an excuse to raise prices, and claims that continuous rain had reduced the arrival of new rice were made with apparent conviction. Therefore, the early market for various foreign rices pulled up prices by $0.70 to nearly $1.00. Subsequently, despite the chaos in Vietnam, the source of supply was not interrupted, and the so-called Vietnam incident was not related to rice prices. The existence of both price controls and new rice squeezing out older rice made the situation bleak. The arrival of Changjiang customer rice from various locations in the port caused floating accounts to emerge and suppress prices after the mid-market, leading to a sharp fall of $1.50. As a result, the closing price was $0.60 to $0.70 lower than the previous day. Yinghua Company No. 2 Western Actual, including military insurance, initially opened at $77.20, then $77, also down $0.50 from the previous day, with over 100 tons traded. Currently, seven to eight thousand bales of rice. No. 1 Chen Saigon opened at $69, Fire Twisted at $68, No. 2 Saigon at $64.50, $64, No. 2 Siam at $63.50.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice was obstructed, the inventory was not weak, and real sales seemed to inquire more than foreign rice, so the market was neither up nor down, and prices were similar to the previous market. Gaozi Chang japonica rice was $79, and Su Kun japonica rice was $77. Glutinous rice from Gaozi Liyuan was $70, and glutinous rice from Danyuan was $68 or $69. Hong Kong goods were the same, but only some thin rice and early and late rice were transported by bicycle, leading to an uneven supply and demand situation. Scarcity made things valuable, and the market rose sharply by $2 alone. It was heard that thin rice from Qingjiao opened at $82. Early rice from Nangang was $79 per bag, and $76.50 to $76 per bushel.</p>
<p>The source of new goods was slightly sparse. Yesterday, they were transported by both water and land routes, totaling about a thousand bags of japonica rice. The destination was good, forming a fixed price. Zhuanqiao New Japonica opened at $75 per bag, and Tai Hui Jiading Yang Jian opened at $67 per bag, and $65.50 to $65 per bushel. The shortage of Du Jian caused the price to rise by $1. Opening prices were $64.50 and $64 per bushel, etc.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is surging. The arrival in Shanghai has been reported daily. Yesterday, the Qiaoli and Hang Yu Sheng ships arrived from Hong Kong with 11,726 bags, and the Desheng ship also arrived from Hong Kong with 2,150 bags. Both ships were docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, and unloading is expected to be completed today. Taikoo Company's Hubei ship arrived at the port yesterday morning, also carrying 426 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the company's own wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Shipped North to Exchange for Northern Goods</h3>
<p>The wheat flour market was stable yesterday. After two consecutive increases recently, prices have reached $16.50 per bag, and the retail price of each bag has been sold at $17.50 due to a shortage of spot goods, attracting the attention of people from all walks of life. According to flour merchants, because the Japanese are restricting freight transport to the North, with the exception of food, it is prevalent to exchange goods for goods. To purchase goods from the North, it is necessary to find goods for exchange, and flour is the most suitable for sale in the North. Therefore, most flour is shipped North to exchange for goods. The production capacity of Chinese factories is limited and naturally cannot meet the demand. It is heard that customer prices are as high as $19, but no firm transactions have been heard of. Currently, the authorities have announced severe punishment for hoarding and manipulating rice and flour prices, and manufacturers have stated that they will temporarily not increase prices further, but it is regrettable that they have not been able to fully meet the real sales on this street. Trade in foreign flour and inland flour is quiet. The No. 4 Pink Peach flour produced by Fufeng Factory is still being exported to this street, and the selling price has also risen to $15.50.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat trade was sluggish due to the new arrival of foreign wheat at Chinese factories and difficulties in supplying the concessions. Japanese factories severely suppressed prices, and sellers were reluctant to comply, resulting in stable prices. It was heard that over a hundred bags of Kunshan and Taicang wheat were traded on the market at a price of $24.60. The prices of other goods have been raised, but no deals have been reached.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Holders Resist Selling, Raw Oil Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the market for forward and spot raw soybean oil rose uniformly by $0.50 to $1.00, due to the manipulation of operators and a speculative environment. However, the sentiment for raw oil began to soften at the morning close. Selling increased in the afternoon, and news from Qingdao was poor, leading to instability in the forward oil market and a further decline. Although the sales market for soybean oil was sluggish, the holders were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the potential remained firm. Yesterday's prices continued to rise by $1.00 to $1.50 compared to the previous market. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of $74.00 to $74.50. 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded at a price of $76.00. 500 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil were traded at a price of $82.00 to $83.00. 250 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at $96.50, and goods en route were at $95.70, falling to $95. 500 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at $69.50 to $69, and goods en route were at $69 to $68.50. 250 pieces for delivery in the first ten days of October were contracted at $69 to $68.50. 100 pieces for delivery in the last ten days of October were contracted at $70.05, falling to $69.75.</p>
<p>In other miscellaneous grains, 300 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Crystal Clear Ice $100</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market fluctuated slightly. The trade association priced spot No. 24 coarse Japanese wharf at $80.50, the same price as foreign wharf goods, up $0.50. Transit goods were $64, unchanged. Dutch cotton Japanese K mark 7D was $76. Spot Dutch red was $63.10, up $0.02, and goods en route were $62.50. Taikoo Car White was slightly soft, B mark was $77.20, down $0.03, and DY and HX marks were both $75.30, down $0.01 to $0.02. The factory's No. 1 ice sugar was $98.50, and crystal clear ice was $100, both up $1.50. Various road Qing No. 2 white bags of No. 1 goods opened at $68.50. The factory's ice flower Qing opened 600 bags at $74.50. Also, 450 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Balls Temporarily Increase by Four Yuan</h3>
<p>—Seven Yuan and Two Jiao Per Load—</p>
<p>Regarding the price of coal balls, each factory, using the Vietnam incident as a pretext, yesterday held a meeting and decided to temporarily increase the factory price by four yuan. The breakdown is as follows: Nanyang, Yi Qin, Xingguo, and Hua coal balls, self-hauled by dealers, cost 132 yuan per ton; delivery is subject to additional transportation costs. For storefronts on this street, the price is seven yuan and two jiao per load; delivered to customers, it is 144 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Male Hygiene After Marriage</h3>
<p>The famous saying "Contentment Brings Happiness" is directed at the "tidal wave of human desires" in today's society. Originally, people's desires are like water in a vast ocean, endless. On the positive side: the reason why mankind has millions of years of history and continuous social progress is entirely due to the endless drive of desires. If people had no desires and everyone remained inactive, the heat of the world would cool down, and social evolution would stagnate. What would that be like? However, if human desires flow too unchecked, people may be fickle and always want more, but the result is still dissatisfaction. Therefore, human worries, pain, and misery follow, and they are as endless as the vast ocean!</p>
<p>A young man of marriageable age? Desire is at its peak, especially sexual desire among all desires. Because sexual desire is an innate instinct, it comes with birth and is strongest in adulthood. At this time, sexual desire is like a steed. If you can control it properly, it can be fully used for your benefit and provide great help. If you do not know how to control it, once it is indulged, you will be unable to control it, and you may be injured or killed by the horse. But if you keep it locked in the stable and prevent it from moving, you will be violating its nature too much, and it may die of illness, which would be a great pity!</p>
<p>From this, we know that for a man after marriage, it is indeed a very dangerous juncture. Many young husbands suddenly experience a decline in their mental capacity, exhibiting poor memory, dull thoughts, and frequent symptoms such as brain swelling, headaches, tinnitus, and blurred vision. At the same time, there is also a rapid decline in sexual function, with symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and scattered energy. However, because of the differences in female physiology, the wife's sexual desire is often particularly high, and the couple's life cannot be coordinated.</p>
<p>The Aftermath of Nocturnal Emission and Effective Treatments</p>
<p>Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Knowing beauty leads to admiration for the young." This is human nature. Emotion is the expression of sex, and sex is the foundation of emotion. Young people, because of the physiological maturity of their sexual functions, often experience intense pressure from hormones stimulating their inner mind. If a young person's will is slightly weaker, it is difficult to resist this pressure, and they involuntarily use objects to play with their genitals to relieve the temporary discomfort. You should know that once this shameful behavior begins, it is very difficult to correct. Therefore, masturbation easily becomes a bad habit. After a while, the sexual nerves are weakened or become hypersensitive, so nocturnal emission follows.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a leak in the health of young people. With this leak, the level of health drops day by day. If he was originally a healthy and lively young man, once he suffers from nocturnal emission, his face will gradually become sallow and thin, and his mental capacity will gradually decline. He will experience poor memory and frequent headaches, tinnitus, and blurred vision, and he may even be unable to read or think. If he overworks, he will experience lower back pain, limb fatigue, and mental exhaustion. In terms of sexual function, he will experience symptoms such as kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, and thin sperm leading to infertility. How can such a man compete in love, win the favor of the opposite sex, and enjoy the happiness that life should offer? Furthermore, he cannot compete with others in society to find a way to make a living. Therefore, he suffers from the double pain of heartbreak and unemployment, and his future is filled with endless worries! The only remedy is to first abstain from masturbation and take the "Hemitol Sperm Consolidation Pills," a special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, which will definitely consolidate the spermatic duct and cure the leakage. If the aforementioned symptoms have already been caused by nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take "Reproduction Prime," a gonadal hormone preparation, to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If continued, it will definitely restore health completely at an early date and can have the effect of prolonging life. If the patient can personally come to this clinic to be diagnosed by a specialist physician and receive the latest scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, treatment can be guaranteed.We imagine that just when the woman in a lower position is expecting tenderness and beautiful eyes, the husband only gives emptiness, illusory deception and incompetence, how can she not be disappointed and resentful? Therefore, many couples stage various tragedies within the family due to dissatisfaction with their sexual lives!</p>
<p>The reason why men get sick after marriage is due to ignorance of hygiene between the sexes. If a man can maintain his virginity before marriage, without masturbation or nocturnal emission, and does not indulge in excessive sexual behavior after marriage, and can always maintain his abundant energy, then not only will he have healthy sexual function and enjoy the love of his spouse forever, living a happy life, but also he will be able to devote himself to his academic and career prospects with doubled energy, and he will certainly have unlimited potential! Compared to the suffering of the aforementioned weakened men after marriage, isn't this like heaven and hell? According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only remedy for the aforementioned men is universally recognized as taking the "Reproduction Prime" gonadal hormone preparation, which is the most effective and appropriate treatment. Therefore, after taking this agent, sperm can be produced and the kidneys replenished, the brain strengthened and blood circulation activated, and the nerves nourished within one day and night. If continued, the aforementioned symptoms will be completely cured in the short term. Only those with nocturnal emission need to also take "Hemitol Sperm Consolidation Pills" to consolidate the spermatic duct and stop the leakage, so that the effect will be rapid!</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>The Breasts are the Bell of Female Happiness</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Happiness is not arranged by fate,</p>
<p>Beauty and health are most praiseworthy,</p>
<p>If the breasts are severely withered,</p>
<p>Quickly learn to remedy with famous medicine.</p>
<p>Through the guidance of many doctors, the publicity of many medical journals, and the proof of facts, most modern-minded women now know that their lifelong happiness is definitely not controlled by "fate" but is really controlled by their own development. Because with good development, all the beautiful female characteristics develop, the breasts are high, the buttocks are plump, the waist is flexible, and walking on the road, one does not need to be artificial but can naturally show all the mysterious and seductive curves. In addition, in terms of muscles, face, and blood, due to the health of the ovaries and the vigorous metabolism, one appears full, ruddy, and tender. Even without applying powder, the face will naturally have a blush-like charm. As for the clarity of intellect, the thoroughness of thought, and the gentleness of temperament, these are indeed the unique talents of these healthy and beautiful women. Therefore, no matter where they are, they can use many excellent conditions to overcome and conquer the environment and obtain the greatest happiness. But if there are many defects and one still does not know to "introspect" to seek remedy, one will not have this happiness.</p>
<p>But then, why do women have these defects? According to the research results of famous Chinese and Western gynecologists and my own, it is believed that it is entirely due to malnutrition, masturbation, leukorrhea, damage from major illnesses, chronic bad habits, menstrual irregularities, and the lack of proper recuperation after childbirth, which leads to unhealthy ovarian function, affecting metabolism. Therefore, the breasts become relaxed and withered, even flat like a man's, the buttocks are thin, the muscles are withered, and they feel disgusted with themselves. Even in their prime, the forehead is full of wrinkles. With such an ugly woman, wanting to win in the arena of love or win the husband's favor, is it still possible? The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Female Reproduction Prime," which is the most effective and appropriate treatment. This agent was invented by the Austrian medical sage Dr. Stadner after more than 30 years of arduous experimentation and was proven by many famous European and American doctors to have great efficacy and peaceful medicinal properties. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leukorrhea. If continued, it can not only cure various hidden female diseases but also make the breasts high and the cheeks rosy, and youth will be preserved.</p>

<h3>Following the Tram Workers' Strike, Bus Workers Also Strike. The Impact on Public Transportation is Extremely Serious. Both Labor and Management Should Wake Up and Quickly Find a Solution.</h3>
<p>After the entire workforce of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Settlement went on strike, they presented four temporary resolution conditions to the head office the day before, requesting the authorities to consider them and approve them as soon as possible. On the morning of the 23rd, they sent four representatives to visit Secretary-General Pollock for direct negotiations. However, because the company believed that the workers' demands were excessive, they only agreed to increase wages, including rice subsidies, by three jiao per day, while the labor side insisted that it must be increased to four jiao and five fen. The two sides argued for half an hour without reaching an agreement. The company also rejected the other three demands, resulting in a deadlock in the negotiations. Yesterday, the labor representatives did not continue to the head office for negotiations, and the situation became increasingly worse. Before the tram workers' strike could be resolved, the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, which the settlement relied on to maintain transportation, also went on strike yesterday morning. Except for rickshaws, the transportation lines in the Public Settlement have been completely interrupted at this point, making it the largest wave in this year's strike tide. The French Concession's buses and public automobiles are still running as usual. The information obtained yesterday regarding the two companies is recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Company Suddenly Announces Strike</h3>
<p>Due to labor-management disputes at the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, both sides had engaged in direct negotiations for the second time on the 23rd of the previous month. It seemed their opinions were converging, and a smooth resolution was within reach. Unexpectedly, at 2 AM yesterday, the labor side, believing the company was repeatedly delaying and acting without sincerity, suddenly decided to go on strike. This action began at 5 AM yesterday, with drivers, conductors, and workshop workers all taking unified steps to strike. The labor side prepared four preconditions yesterday, which they will present to the company authorities today.</p>
<p>Presenting Four Preconditions</p>
<p>After the strike began, all workers were able to strictly maintain order, with no unexpected disturbances. They unanimously resolved to put forward four preconditions: (1) A daily increase of 50 cents in living allowance; (2) Wages to be paid as normal during the strike period; (3) No workers to be dismissed without reason; (4) Mutually beneficial labor-management terms to be resolved within one week. The above preconditions will be presented to the company authorities today, and if accepted by the company, work will resume immediately. According to one worker speaking to a reporter, this strike was a last resort. In this serious time, they do not wish for the labor unrest to drag on, damaging public interests. If the management can accept these four minimum demands, the labor side can resume work immediately. Regarding the company potentially using White Russians to replace the workers and resume operation of some vehicles, the labor side anticipates this is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>Management Publicly Announces Terms</p>
<p>Regarding the 23 demands previously made by the public bus company workers, the management has responded to each one: (1) The company must recognize the workers' representatives as having the right to represent all workers. The response was: The company welcomes the establishment of a workers' representative committee. The committee has the power to represent the workers in resolving all matters. (2) The company must agree not to dismiss workers without reason; in cases of serious misconduct and with sufficient evidence, the company may act according to established regulations. The response was: The company has never dismissed workers without reason, but the company reserves the right to dismiss any worker for misconduct or poor performance. (3) The company will improve workers' treatment at any time according to changes in local cost of living indices and market conditions; when necessary, the company will convene workers' representatives to discuss this together. The response was: The company has always paid a cost-of-living allowance, and recently increased this allowance automatically. In addition, the company also pays a special rice subsidy, depending on rice price fluctuations. (4) Average daily working hours must not exceed eight hours; any hours worked beyond eight hours must be treated as overtime, with each hour counted as one and a half hours. The response was: The workers' average daily work does not need to exceed eight hours, and this has already been agreed upon. At times, it is unavoidable that the hours may vary slightly due to operational needs, but as this is unavoidable, the overtime work will be compensated at the original wage rate. (5) Sundays and holidays will be paid as normal; if work is required on Sundays or holidays, double pay must be given. The response was: Sundays cannot be considered special holidays, but the Lunar New Year holidays are five days long and will be paid double at the original wage. The company provides workers with one day off for every nine days of work. (6) At the end of each year, the company must issue a bonus equal to 10% of each worker's annual salary. The response was: The company has already ordered the issuance of a New Year bonus equal to 5% of annual salary. (7) Workers' wages must be increased once each year. The response was: The issue of wage increases is stipulated in the employment contract, and the company will always strictly adhere to it. (8) Workers who take sick leave will be paid full wages. The response was: Workers who take sick leave must obtain the approval of the company doctor and will receive half pay plus half of the rice subsidy; venereal disease is an exception. (9) In the event of traffic accidents, the company will be responsible for compensation to the victims and civil claims. The response was: The company must determine that the traffic accident was not due to the negligence of the company's employees in order to provide assistance. (10) Employee compensation agreement. The response was: The company has a standard compensation policy for those injured on duty, and if the injury results in death, their family will receive it. (11) Workers may ride the bus for free. The response was: Workers may ride bus routes 5 and 10 for free. (12) When the company hires new employees, it must first select from among the dismissed former workers. The response was: The company cannot re-employ dismissed workers, but workers who have been laid off due to business decline will have priority for re-employment. (13) If a worker must resign due to special circumstances, the company must provide a certain amount of subsidy. The response was: The company's contingency fund is specifically for subsidizing employees who have served for more than five years and must resign due to unavoidable circumstances. (14) The company must subsidize the workers' representative committee with $500 per month. The response was: Cannot agree. (15) The company must establish schools for the families of workers. The response was: Already implemented. (16) After six months of probation, workers will become permanent employees. The response was: Already implemented. (17) Permanent employees will receive monthly salaries. The response was: Agreed. (19) Company staff must promote cooperation with workers. The response was: This is fully supported by the company. (20) Items beneficial to the workers must be maintained. The response was: The company will not cancel the benefits currently enjoyed by workers without the consent of the workers' representatives. (21) Workers who have committed offenses must be interrogated by the company and must not be dismissed solely on the basis of one party's report. The response was: Workers' discipline must be managed by the company in accordance with the regulations in clause 3. (22) The items mentioned in this agreement apply to all workers within the company. The response was: Agreed. (23) This agreement will take effect immediately after being amended and signed by both parties. The response was: Agreed.</p>
<p>Workers Have No Special Demands</p>
<p>The English-language 大美晚報 (Great China Evening Post) reported that all Chinese employees of the British-owned public bus company announced a general strike this morning (the 24th), following the precedent set by the British-owned tram company workers four days ago, causing further inconvenience to public transportation in the International Settlement. According to a member of the public bus company, labor and management have been negotiating for many days, but the striking workers have not made any special demands. They were unwilling to disclose the nature of the negotiations and could not say whether management would resume negotiations with labor within a few days.</p>
<p>Dispatching Other Drivers to Maintain Transportation</p>
<p>This strike by public bus company workers is the second time this year, as there was also labor unrest this spring, with foreign workers temporarily serving as drivers. It is rumored that the management intends to redeploy foreign workers as drivers, but this has not been confirmed. However, if the labor side does not resume work, the company may dispatch buses tomorrow (the 25th) to maintain the main routes. It was also reported by a member of the company near noon today that the 23 demands previously made by the labor side, along with the management's responses, will be issued to the newspapers for publication this afternoon.</p>
<p>Office Workers Arrive Late</p>
<p>The sudden strike at the public bus company this morning resulted in many citizens arriving late to their offices, and the rates for rickshaws and automobiles tripled. Meanwhile, the strike by 2,500 workers at the tram company remains unresolved, as yesterday's talks between labor and management failed to reach an agreement. A large number of striking workers gathered around the tram depot on Hart Road this morning. The company erected barbed wire barriers around the depot to prevent unforeseen events, but there were no incidents in the morning.</p>
<h3>Tram Strike - No Negotiations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The labor and management sides of the Shanghai Tram Company met on the 23rd of the previous month at the company's headquarters on South Suzhou Road to discuss a solution. However, the amount offered by the management regarding the wage increase was still 15 cents short of the amount requested by the labor side, and other conditions also failed to receive responses from both sides, resulting in unsuccessful negotiations. However, with both sides eager to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible, it was decided to hold direct negotiations again yesterday morning. However, by 10:30 AM, no labor representatives had arrived.</p>
<p>Labor Side Insists on Original Demands</p>
<p>Wu Zhiyu, the Chinese compradore of the tram company, telephoned the tram company at 95 Yidingpan Road at 11:00 AM yesterday to inquire about the situation, stating that the difference between the two sides on the wage issue was only 15 cents and that it would not be difficult to find a proper solution. He hoped that representatives would be sent to the company as soon as possible to continue negotiations. A certain gentleman from the tram union replied on the phone that after listening to the reports of the four representatives on the negotiations the day before, the union immediately informed all the workers, who all agreed that the original demands regarding the wage increase must be maintained. He asked the management to reconsider and quickly approve the labor's demands for a wage increase in order to reopen negotiations and resume work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Prerequisite Problem Lies in Wage Increase</p>
<p>A reporter asked a certain worker about his opinion on the wage increase yesterday. According to him, when the demands were made to the company on the 19th, the management agreed to pay a subsidy of 10 cents per person per day and a rice subsidy of 15 cents. However, what we demanded was a daily wage increase of 50 cents, and we advocated for the abolition of the rice subsidy, because the company has the right to cancel the subsidy at any time at the end of the year. Furthermore, our wages have not been increased since the outbreak of the war. During the negotiations the day before, in order to show their enthusiasm for cooperation, the labor side voluntarily reduced the proposed daily wage increase of 50 cents to 45 cents, and the management also considered the difficult living conditions of the workers and added another 5 cents to the subsidy, but it was still not close to the demand of 45 cents. Therefore, the breakthrough in the stalemate in the negotiations must first start with the wage increase.</p>
<p>Negotiations May Continue Today</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the reporter's investigation, after the labor representatives failed to reach an agreement in the negotiations the day before, they reported the situation of the negotiations with the management to all the workers. Because all the workers gathered yesterday to discuss countermeasures, they did not send representatives to the headquarters to continue negotiations. It is heard that the labor side will still send four representatives to the company today to continue discussing solutions.</p>
<p>Workers Publish the Truth of the Strike</p>
<p>All the workers of the British-owned tram company published an article yesterday, reporting "The Truth of the British Tram Labor Unrest." The article stated: "Fellow citizens and friends from foreign countries, the British Tram has been suspended for four days. First of all, what is the current living situation of the British Tram workers? Before the war, the company's daily operating income was only five or six thousand yuan, but now that the Hongkou area has not yet opened, the operating income has increased to more than 30,000 yuan. However, this situation has made the workers even more miserable. The working hours are nominally eight hours, but in reality, including shift handover, paying money, etc., it is actually more than 12 hours.</p>
<p>How Can We Maintain Our Livelihood with the High Cost of Living?</p>
<p>But what about the wages we receive? With today's unprecedented high cost of living in Shanghai, how can we cover this huge expense? For example, a driver recently earns a monthly wage of 22 yuan to 33 yuan, plus rice subsidies, and can earn between 50 yuan and more than 60 yuan per month. If there are wives, children, and parents in the family, and the price of rice is now more than 70 yuan per picul, the wages earned can hardly buy even one picul of rice. What money is left to pay for rent, firewood, salt, vegetables, and other expenses? Ticket sellers and coppersmiths are about the same. Let's talk about the gatekeepers and other workers, who are truly extremely pitiful, earning less than one yuan a day. Everyone, please think about it, how difficult is our life? Half-starved and half-full, most people have to borrow money from others, a lot of money.</p>
<p>The Company Authorities Lack Foresight</p>
<p>Since our lives are so difficult, the company not only cannot improve our situation, but even deepens the exploitation and oppression of workers. Dismissing supervisors is a common occurrence, and it has become even more severe after the "August 13th" incident. They always adopt oppressive and destructive measures against any legitimate worker organizations, capturing former union leaders and people who are enthusiastic about worker interests. However, the most painful thing is the lack of foresight of the company authorities. When the current international situation is changing and the invaders are in a dilemma on the front lines, they are desperately deploying in the rear, excluding British and American interests, and attempting to monopolize the market and the Far East. There are also certain elements who are provoking discord, and this is not accidental. It is precisely at this time that the British Tram Company is experiencing a distorted prosperity after the war, earning millions every year, but is unwilling to slightly improve the lives of the workers. In the previous period, we workers had repeatedly made demands (e.g., the letter to the general manager on June 18th), but the company was unwilling to consider them. Under these circumstances, once the workers are exploited by the invaders and certain elements use a part of the confused workers to incite labor unrest in order to achieve their new sinister goals, so as to create a second Lun Chang.</p>
<p>All Workers Should Awaken</p>
<p>Today, the British Tram labor unrest has taken shape in this way, and provocateurs have run into our ranks. This is our danger, and also the company's danger. All workers, everyone stand up and raise our vigilance. We are supporting the unions that work for the welfare of the workers, and conversely, we must oppose them. Now, our more than 3,000 workers in the mechanical and transportation departments unanimously demand that the company authorities consider our demands. We always feel that with today's cost of living index in Shanghai and the company's operating conditions, our demand for a 15 yuan wage increase is not too much. We hope that the company will agree to this demand so as not to let the labor unrest drag on.</p>
<h3>Horiuchi and Miura Transferring Duties</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai on the 大洋丸 (Taiyo Maru) at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, the Consul-General Horiuchi Kanjō began yesterday to transfer duties to the outgoing Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki at the Japanese Consulate-General. This is expected to be completed within days. As for Miura Yoshiaki, after receiving orders to be transferred to the post of Minister to Mexico, he has been busy saying farewell to various parties. Once the handover is completed, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 26th to take up his new post in Mexico via Japan.</p>

<h3>Rice Weevils Manipulating and Creating Mischief - Details Became More Apparent Yesterday; Sudden Rise and Fall Based on Rumors; Shanghai Municipal Council Price Section Pays Attention to Retail Prices</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Bribing, Sentenced to Five Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Price Investigation Office issued its third public announcement yesterday, stating that since the issuance of the second public announcement, the office has spared no effort in collecting materials on the inventory and prices of various major commodities, with excellent results, and that emphasis is being placed on the "retail" aspect of this issue. Regarding the appropriate and reasonable profit margins for each industry, multiple meetings have been held with merchants dealing in food, fish, meat, coal, and flour to engage in discussions. The main theme of the discussions was the cooperation between each industry and the bureau. Retail prices have been corrected in many cases. As for the overall correction of various major commodities, due to the large scope, it still requires time.</p>
<p>Rice and Wheat Market Conditions</p>
<p>Market conditions have not improved recently. The main reason for this is the downward trend in exchange rates, and rice prices have reached new peaks. Although the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee has assessed that Saigon No. 1 rice should not exceed 61.5 yuan, if the price of foreign rice does not fall, the above price limit may need to be reassessed and raised. The domestic wheat market was stabilized at the beginning of last month through the efforts of the authorities, but it has recently deteriorated again due to various reasons, resulting in a shortage of domestic wheat sources and rising flour prices. "Family bread" has risen from 38 cents per pound to 41 cents. The authorities are now making every effort to improve the situation. At the same time, a large number of foreign wheat is being imported, which should prevent the market from becoming more severe.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Are Under Control</p>
<p>Coal prices are relatively satisfactory. Black market coal prices are often 10% to 15% lower than the list price. This is probably because many small factories have suspended operations, and the demand for coal has decreased. Several shops and stalls have been individually investigated and fined between 5 and 15 yuan for delaying or not displaying price tags. In addition, the office has received several reports of price increases, and after dispatching staff to investigate, the shops concerned have voluntarily adjusted their prices after persuasion.</p>
<p>Bribery Punished</p>
<p>Speculative rice weevils continued to be active in the market yesterday morning, spreading rumors, making it impossible to determine the truth, resulting in sudden rise and fall of the entire rice market. However, with sufficient inventory, sellers rushed to sell at high prices, causing an oversupply of spot goods and sluggish sales. The market conditions finally weakened, resulting in a fall in foreign rice prices by 50 to 60 cents compared to yesterday. In summary, it can be seen that the rice inventory in the city is sufficient, and buyers are obviously feeling sluggish. At the same time, it can also be seen that speculative rice weevils are creating mischief, and the rumors are inaccurate. In addition, rice broker Sun Jinguang attempted to sell No. 2 Saigon rice at 65 yuan per picul at a tea market at the Qingliange Rice Shop on Fuzhou Road on the 13th of this month, when the on-site investigator Mao Guomai discovered that it exceeded the price limit assessed by the Evaluation Committee by 6 yuan per picul. He was arrested, and Sun immediately offered a bribe of 40 yuan in legal tender in an attempt to buy his release, but failed. He was handed over to the First Special Court. In addition to being sentenced to 15 days of detention for exceeding the price limit, which has been reported previously, he was sentenced yesterday morning by Judge Shi of the same court for bribery, intending to buy his release, and sentenced to five months of imprisonment to deter others. Those who were in court at the time all cheered.</p>
<p>Bumper Harvest Situation</p>
<p>According to news from the rice industry, domestic rice can still be shipped to Shanghai continuously every day, only the quantity is slightly reduced compared to the past. As long as a batch of rice is sold, it can be applied for in the local area. Once the "transport permit" is obtained, the rice can be shipped to Shanghai at any time. Therefore, the rumors in the rice market are all deliberate fabrications in order to raise rice prices, and are not credible. Although rice is coming in continuously, speculators are also constantly hoarding it, because their desires are never satisfied, resulting in unprecedentedly high rice prices at this time and place. It is known that the late rice and early rice crops in the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and the Pudong area of Shanghai are all ripe this autumn. Early rice can yield two bags per mu, and late rice can yield four piculs of rice per mu. If they can be transported to Shanghai, the profits will be more than doubled. There is really no need to worry about the people's food, only to fear that there will be rumors and opportunistically raising prices.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Liners Still Sailing to Haiphong; Voyage Schedule Slightly Changed Due to Shipping Relations; The Incident of the Japanese Warship Bombarding the Manley</h3>
<p>After the French-Japanese agreement was signed on Sunday (22nd), it was rumored that Japanese troops had landed, but foreign shipping companies in the city had not received confirmation as of last night. Therefore, there is no change in the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping line, and the voyage schedule is still set.</p>
<p>Rescheduled Sailing</p>
<p>However, the Taikoo company's Qingyuan is now scheduled to set sail on the morning of the 27th, instead of the 26th. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong and Hong Kong on Friday (27th). According to the company's announcement yesterday, the vessel is sailing from Hong Kong to Haiphong and is now returning to Shanghai via Hong Kong. There will be some delays en route, and the company is afraid that the vessel will not be able to return to Shanghai within the week. Therefore, the sailing date from Shanghai to Haiphong is subject to change. The Mingsheng is still scheduled to sail to Haiphong on October 1st.</p>
<p>Manley Escapes Danger</p>
<p>The British-owned Manley Mahler set sail from Shanghai to Haimen on the 19th of this month. That night, it sailed into Jiaojiang and arrived safely at its destination. Unexpectedly, when it sailed back to Shanghai from Haimen on the 20th after loading passengers and goods, it was bombarded by a Japanese warship outside the Jiaojiang Estuary. At that time, as many as ten shots were fired.</p>
<p>The situation was extremely dangerous. The shipowner immediately issued a distress signal and dropped anchor to stop. After the Japanese warship opened fire, it sent a speedboat carrying Japanese soldiers to board the ship for inspection. The shipowner questioned why the warship arbitrarily bombarded a merchant ship. The Japanese side claimed that the ship did not obey the orders of the Japanese warship and sailed without authorization, so the bombardment was a warning. At that time, a nearby British warship received the distress signal and.</p>
<p>Sailed to Protect</p>
<p>After the officers on the warship negotiated with the Japanese side, the ship was finally allowed to be released. The ship sailed back to Shanghai under the protection of the British warship on the morning of the 22nd and arrived at the port at 7:00 PM the night before. Fortunately, the passengers and goods on board were safe and have been unloaded ashore. It is reported that the bombardment was very serious.</p>
<p>The Hull Was Damaged</p>
<p>One corner of the navigation room was hit by a shell. Although the damage was not severe, the passengers were terrified. It is heard that the ship will be repaired in Shanghai and plans to continue sailing. However, there are many difficulties along the Haimen shipping line. The company is asking the British Consulate to negotiate with the Japanese side to guarantee the safety of future voyages and will stop taking passengers to avoid danger. The date of resumption of sailing has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing and He Dekui Visit Xie Jinyuan</h3>
<p>The Isolated Battalion Still Has Strict Security; Obstacles May Be Removed Today</p>
<p>Although the dispute between the Isolated Battalion and the White Russian thugs at the Jiaozhou Road Isolated Battalion has been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors for discussion, and He Dekui has visited Commander Xie Jinyuan twice to discuss a solution, no concrete conditions have been decided. Security around the camp remains strict, the electricity supply has not been restored, and the high-intensity searchlights around the camp at night make it seem like a dead city. At around 1:00 PM yesterday, Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and He Dekui, the deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, visited Xie Jinyuan at the Isolated Battalion for the third time. The content of the meeting is unknown. It is vaguely heard that the security obstacles around the camp may be completely removed today.</p>
<h3>British Expatriates in Shanghai Actively Provide Relief; Contributing Funds to Purchase Aircraft for Defense; Donations Remitted for Relief</h3>
<p>Since various places in London have been subjected to repeated air raids, British expatriates in Shanghai are deeply concerned. The British Central War Relief Fund has remitted £2,500 on September 11th for relief. All donations from the 10th of the month to the end of the month will also be remitted on October 1st. As of the 20th, £900 has been received. British expatriates in Shanghai have now decided on two ways to provide relief for the London air raids: (1) Donate funds to purchase warplanes for air defense; (2) Remit donations to provide relief to injured residents and orphaned refugees.</p>
<h3>Each Police Station in the U.S. Military Zone Takes Special Precautions; Machine Guns Are Set Up at the Entrance; Bowen Says It Is Purely to Prevent Accidents</h3>
<p>Since the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment soldiers were stationed at the Putuo Road Police Station on Monday (the 23rd) to provide security, yesterday the four police stations in the western district of the Shanghai International Settlement closed their doors. The police department denied that there was any special reason for these precautions. According to Major Bowen, the Chief Inspector, this measure is purely routine and intended to prevent accidents, and has no special significance. The stationing of U.S. soldiers can be cancelled at any time, and the closure of the doors can also be lifted at any time. The four police stations implementing this new system are the Gordon Road Police Station, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the Old Zha Police Station, and the Putuo Road Police Station. Each police station has special guards with Thompson submachine guns in front of the gate, and the Putuo Road Police Station is still guarded by U.S. soldiers.</p>
<h3>Invigorating Social Morality and People's Hearts: A Record of the Five Societies Jointly Lecturing on Scriptures - Elucidating the Common Ground of the Five Religions, Not Discussing Politics - The First Lecture is on Filial Piety by Shen Daling</h3>
<p>The "Five Societies Jointly Lecturing on Scriptures," initiated by Mr. Shen Daling and other religious believers in this city, commenced lectures on the 22nd of this month. This society is dedicated to studying the common ground of various religions and does not discuss politics. In addition to members, anyone who wishes to attend the lectures will be given a listening ticket. The front of the ticket specifies the location and date, and the back lists three points for listeners to note: (1) This society focuses on the common ground of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Differences will not be criticized to avoid misunderstandings. (2) Listeners who have clear insights into the common ground between two or more of the five religions and wish to give a presentation can choose a lecture date within the period stipulated by the society and report it to the society. (3) Listeners who have clear insights into the common ground between two or more of the five religions but do not wish to give a presentation can report it to the society in writing, providing materials for the presentation. The scheduled time is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the second and fourth Sundays of each month.</p>
<p>A Full House of Listeners</p>
<p>The lectures commenced at 3:00 PM (old time) on the 22nd of this month. It rained heavily on that day, so most of those who obtained listening tickets did not attend. However, the listeners still filled the seats and were very attentive. The initiators of the lecture society were Messrs. Shen Daling, Yao Taiping, and Yang Zhongyi. Mr. Shen, nearly eighty years old and with a leg ailment, arrived at the society with a cane. He described the purpose of initiating the lecture society, and briefly explained the common ground of the five religions, stating that the purpose of initiating the society is to seek the great unity of the world. To achieve the great unity of the world, the boundaries between various religions must first be broken down.</p>
<p>Promoting Filial Piety: The Same in All Five Religions</p>
<p>Our country has always regarded Confucius as the founder of Confucianism. In fact, Confucius had the ideal of great unity and declared that education should be for all, without discrimination. Confucianism is only one of the nine streams of thought in the "Arts and Literature Monographs" of Ban Gu's "History of the Han Dynasty" and is not enough to limit Confucius. The purpose of this society is to clarify the common ground of various religions. As for the point that all five religions agree on, nothing is easier to understand than the word "filial piety," with filial piety being the first of all virtues. The Confucian teachings on filial piety are fully recorded in the "Four Books and the Analects." Confucius answered many questions about filial piety, and the "Great Learning," "Doctrine of the Mean," and "Mencius" also mention filial piety in many places.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu's Filial Piety and Kindness: The Same as the "Great Learning"</p>
<p>We have seen the "Tao Te Ching" of Taoism since childhood, and its opening chapter says, "I have been a scholar-official for seventeen generations." Who is this "I"? It is Zhang Zhong, who is filial and friendly in the "Book of Songs." Lao Tzu spoke of filial piety and kindness, which is the same as the "Great Learning." He said that filial piety and kindness exist when the six family relationships are not harmonious, which shows that filial piety and kindness are inherent in everyone. It is only when the six family relationships are not harmonious that one begins to realize who is filial and who is kind. Buddhism has the "Sutra on Repaying the Kindness of Parents," and the Book of Genesis in Christianity records the filial conduct of Joseph.</p>
<p>Joseph's Filial Piety and Friendship Extended to His Brothers</p>
<p>After being sold by his half-brothers, Joseph became the prime minister of Egypt and held the power of the country. During the years of famine, Egypt alone had a large store of food due to Joseph's foresight. His father sent his half-brothers to Egypt to buy grain. Joseph did not dwell on the past misdeeds of his half-brothers but asked for his younger brother from the same mother to come and gave them food. He also told the king to welcome his father to live with him, until his father died. He followed his father's order to return for burial. This is because he was filial to his father and extended it to his brothers and his half-brothers, which is the same as the meaning of the "Analects" quoting the "Book of Documents," "Only be filial and friendly to your brothers."</p>
<p>Promoting Filial Piety and Friendship: Harmony Among Relatives and Care for the Needy</p>
<p>The Proverbs of Solomon say, "Be a dutiful son to your father, and a unique darling to your mother." They also say, "Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice," further describing the spirit of filial piety. The Quran of Islam also mentions filial piety in many places, saying, "You should be kind to your parents, you should be harmonious with your relatives, and you should provide for the orphans and the poor," which is the same as the meaning of "filial piety, friendship, harmony among relatives, and care for the needy" in the "Rites of Zhou." As for the common points of various religions, it is not easy to finish discussing them all at once, and they will be discussed successively in the future. The speeches of Messrs. Yao and Yang will be published later.</p>
<h3>Admiral Hepburn Arrives in Shanghai Today - Staying for Two or Three Weeks - Escorted by Five Destroyers</h3>
<p>Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (the 25th) aboard his flagship, the USS Augusta. The ship is scheduled to dock at the British Navy pontoon. It is expected that Admiral Hepburn will stay in Shanghai for two or three weeks before heading to Manila for the winter. It is reported that the USS Isabel, Admiral Hepburn's fast ship, and destroyers Nos. 218, 219, 222, 224, and 230 will escort the flagship to Shanghai. They will dock at the Yangshupu pontoon. The duration of their stay in Shanghai has not been announced, but it is expected to be only a few days. In addition, the light cruiser USS Marblehead, which recently arrived in Shanghai, sailed from Qingdao the day before yesterday. Although its destination has not been announced, it is generally speculated that it is heading to Manila. As for the five destroyers that will accompany Admiral Hepburn, it was previously announced that they would go directly to Manila. Therefore, the sudden arrival in Shanghai seems surprising.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Remaining in Shanghai Decide to Move to America - Numbering Around 20,000 - Requiring US$5 Million</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that this city has received reliable news that the National Refugee Service of New York has decided to relocate approximately 20,000 German and Austrian Jewish refugees currently in Shanghai to the United States in the near future. The details of the plan are unknown.</p>
<p>Wealthy Sponsorship</p>
<p>However, it is known that this move is backed by several wealthy American Jews. The president of the National Refugee Service is Mr. Chamberlain, a prominent figure in New York. The secretary, Mr. Warburg, is the head of an American railway company and several banks. Other important figures who initiated this resettlement movement include Mr. Sulzberger, publisher of the "New York Times," and Mr. Rawson Walter, a famous New York lawyer. It is reported that the organization has already raised funds to carry out its purpose, estimated to be US$5 million.</p>
<p>Previous Plans</p>
<p>A reporter inquired with the U.S. Consulate in this city and was told that they have not yet received official news about the resettlement of Jewish refugees. However, if there is sufficient financial assistance, then this plan can proceed. Previously, there were rumors of trying to relocate the Jewish refugees in this city to Yunnan Province and Mindanao Island. Both of these plans seem to have failed.</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing Drive: Deadline Approaching - Shanghai Intensifies Promotion - Determined to Raise Enough Funds as Scheduled</h3>
<p>The General Committee of the National Winter Clothing Drive previously stipulated that the fundraising goal for this year's winter clothing drive is 10 million yuan, 6 million yuan domestically and 4 million yuan overseas. The fundraising period is from August 15 to October 31, a period of two and a half months. As the deadline is approaching, a telegram is being sent to compatriots at home and abroad to respond and participate. The telegram roughly stated that the soldiers braved the cold in the icy and snowy fields, and the displaced refugees were shivering and crying out in the cold. Their loyalty and courage are admired by everyone, and their dedication to the country is sympathized with by the world. Since the 27th year of the Republic [1938], the Association has loudly appealed and launched a winter clothing drive to transfer and donate to the soldiers and refugees on the front lines. It deeply relies on the generous donations of our compatriots at home and abroad. Over the past two years, it has successively raised more than 7 million pieces of winter clothing, and in the past two summers, it has manufactured more than 300,000 sets of summer clothing made of grass cloth and 80,000 mosquito nets, which were distributed to the soldiers. This year, the Winter Clothing Drive will continue to be launched. We must uniformly promote and widely publicize it so that we can complete the fundraising as scheduled. All circles in this city have decided to comply with the above-mentioned telegram and intensify the promotion so that the 500,000 yuan in winter clothing donations can be raised in full as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Pharmacology Expert Dr. Zhang Changshao Returns to China</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Changshao, a native of Jiading, Jiangsu, graduated from the National Shanghai Medical College at an early age. He is proficient in medicine and specializes in pharmacology. He has served as a faculty member at his alma mater and St. John's University for many years and has been highly regarded by medical authorities such as Yan Fuqing and Zhu Hengbi. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee selected students to study in the UK, and Mr. Zhang was honored as the first-ranked student in the entire class. He went abroad in the autumn of that year and entered the University of London, majoring in pharmacology. He soon obtained a doctorate in philosophy from the university. After that, he stayed at the pharmacology institutes of the British Pharmaceutical Society and Oxford University to continue his research, making many inventions. His papers have been eagerly contended for by famous European and American scientific publications. He then crossed the ocean to work at Harvard Medical School in the United States. Medical schools and pharmaceutical companies in that country also competed to hire him. Mr. Zhang intends to serve his motherland and has resigned from his overseas positions. He returned to Shanghai on the Russian Empress the night before last.</p>

<h3>Xin Da Xiang Sues Tenant for Rent Increase - Judgment Approves a 10% Increase - Litigation Costs Shared 70/30 by Plaintiff and Defendant</h3>
<p>The shop and upstairs rooms of Xin Da Xiang Silk and Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 614 Nanjing Road are leased from Dehe Foreign Firm. In addition to using the entire shop and part of the building, Xin Da Xiang sublets the remaining part to thirteen tenants. Recently, the landlord increased the rent from 1,900 yuan to 3,000 yuan and required it to bear the water bill. Xin Da Xiang also notified each tenant that from July of this year, the rent would be</p>
<p>Increased by 80% Across the Board</p>
<p>The tenants opposed the rent increase because they considered it an unprecedentedly large increase. Xin Da Xiang then hired lawyer Wang Zhengshao to sue three of the tenants in the civil division of the Special First District Court: Yu Ling Typing School, Mei Duo Wireless Radio Research Institute, and Jin Ji Company, requesting permission to increase the rent by 80%. The tenants also hired lawyers Wei Weiqing and Xuan Zhendong to defend them in court, arguing that Xin Da Xiang's occupied shop, compared with the rent of the adjacent Tai Chang Ginseng Shop per square foot, has already exceeded the rent it should pay, and the sum of its sublet income is an</p>
<p>Additional Profit</p>
<p>Therefore, they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. After two hearings by Judge Ni, the judgment date arrived yesterday afternoon. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers. Judge Ni ascended the bench and announced the judgment, the gist of which was that the rent for July of this year would remain the same. From August, permission was granted to increase the rent by 10%. The plaintiff would bear 70% of the litigation costs, and the defendant would bear 30%.</p>
<h3>Forging Warehouse Receipts for Loans - Complex Circumstances - Six People Detained</h3>
<p>Liang Bin, a Cantonese, worked at Yongtaihe Tobacco Company. Recently, he stole blank warehouse receipts from the company and filled them in with the names of goods, then pledged them to Zhou Zongyao and others for loans totaling around 10,000 yuan. When the loans became due, Liang could not repay them, and the warehouse receipts were forged and could not be used to pick up the goods. Zhou then, on the 17th of this month, together with his colleagues Xue Zongyu, Sun Chunguang, and Chen Xiexiong, took Liang to Room 627 of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road and placed him under house arrest. It was not until the day before yesterday that Liang used the phone to notify his brother, who reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese detectives Peng Bingsheng and Zhang Guanyao rushed to the scene and arrested Liang, Chen, Zhou, Xue, Sun, and another Cantonese, Liang Yuan, together. Yesterday, they were taken to the criminal division of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi requested that they be temporarily detained and interrogated at a later date because the case was complex and there was insufficient time to investigate. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xie-fen, he ordered them to be detained pending a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Searching a Car - Apprehending Kidnappers - Foiled Attempt to Kidnap Qian Jinfathe</h3>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station saw a Yunfei car on Route de la victoire (now West Yan'an Road) in Western Shanghai on the 12th of this month. It looked suspicious, so they arrested Tang Maosheng from Pudong, who was in the car. The Yunfei chauffeur, Weng Zhaogui, was also suspected of assisting, and was also arrested. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Special First District Court for questioning and detention. It was found that Tang Maosheng had intended to collude with accomplices at 12:00 noon on September 12 to kidnap Qian Jinfathe, the young owner of Qian Yongji Iron Factory at No. 30, Lane 370, Xiaoshadu Road. The kidnapping was not successful. Weng Zhaogui was also involved in helping to destroy evidence, so he was also prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu questioned them and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Stockbroker - Fraudulently Receives a Large Sum - Hu Qichao Detained</h3>
<p>Hu Qichao, a Shanghai native residing at No. 25, Guanhua Lane, Route Lafayette, was a broker's assistant at Zhongyong Foreign Firm, a stock brokerage firm at No. 45 Jiujiang Road. Last week, Hu falsely claimed to be acting on behalf of a client and handled 1,000 shares of Ken Zhi stock. As a result, he obtained 27,100 yuan from Zhongyong Foreign Firm. When Zhongyong discovered the fraud and tried to pay the money to the bank, it had already been withdrawn by Hu. The firm then reported the matter to the General Police Station, and Chinese detective Ren Fengbiao arrested Hu. It was found that after obtaining the money, Hu had spent only 100 yuan, and the rest was deposited in the New China Bank. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Fang Fushu requested that he be temporarily detained because the investigation had not yet been completed. After Judge Shi reviewed the report, he ordered Hu to be detained pending further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Regular Meeting - Screening Slow-Motion Films</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week is scheduled to be held at the Capital Hotel on Thursday, September 26th at noon. At that time, various slow-motion films taken by the high-speed camera of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States will be screened. It is reported that if members of the club invite friends to the meeting, they must call the club (16450) before noon on Wednesday to reserve seats in advance. Members from other cities are also welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Merchant - Zhang Zhiyu Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping - Bandits Lie in Wait at the Alley Entrance and Kidnap Him by Car - Escape Increased Due to Mid-Journey Engine Damage</h3>
<p>At approximately 10:15 AM yesterday morning at the intersection of Qinghai Road and Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession, a kidnapping attempt occurred. Zhang Zhiyu, a cotton yarn merchant residing at No. 26, Lane 29, Qinghai Road (i.e., Lane Shanqing), was riding in his private black-plated car No. 844 and drove out of the lane. Unexpectedly, three bandits were lying in wait by the roadside, two of them armed with guns. Seeing Chen's car approaching, they immediately stepped forward to block the road, jumped into the car, and drove the car of Zhang. A bandit was driven out of the car, and a bandit drove the car westward at a high speed. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Seymour Road and Jing'an Temple Road, the car suddenly stalled and could not move forward. The bandits had no choice but to get out of the car and flee in different directions. Zhang and his car were unharmed. He then summoned a street police officer and went to the Chengdu Road Police Station to report the kidnapping. The head of the police then ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to track down the bandits, but the bandits had already fled far away. It is heard that Zhang has made huge profits from speculation.</p>
<h3>Six Armed Robbers Rob a Home - The Owner Fights Back with Bare Hands - One of the Leading Bandits is Knocked Down and Captured - The Remaining Bandits Flee When They See Things Going Badly</h3>
<p>Fang Shanjun, a senior employee of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory in this city and a native of Zhenhai, residing at No. 50, Lane 53, Ximen Road in the French Concession, was suddenly raided by six armed bandits dressed in black long gowns at 9:30 PM the night before last (the 23rd). One bandit held a pistol, and another held a Mauser pistol. At that time, Fang's brother, Shanji (24 years old), was talking in the living room. A bandit entered with a gun to monitor him. Shanji was very alert and immediately came up with a plan. He said to the bandit, "Your pistol is fake." The bandit, unaware of the trick, argued that it was real and showed the bullets in the gun to prove it was a real gun. Unexpectedly, at that moment, Shanji suddenly raised a bench and hit him hard on the head, causing him to bleed profusely and fall to the ground in pain. The remaining bandits, knowing that things were going badly, all rushed out of the door and fled. The injured bandit was captured by Shanji, and the pistol thrown on the ground was recovered, and four bullets were found. He then reported to the police station and took the pistol and the bullet back to the police station together. According to his confession, the bandit's name is Chen Zhenbiao, a native of Ningbo. He was sent to the Second Special District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday and ordered to be detained for a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Captain Killed - Chinese Army Battalion Commander Killed in Action</h3>
<p>According to news from Songjiang and Wujiang, two motorboats of the Second Battalion of the Chinese Army Chen Yaozong's department encountered five Japanese boats at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday at the Maiyougang area on the border between Wu and Qing. The Chinese army fought and retreated to the vicinity of Chengsi. The Japanese boats increased their pursuit and attack. The Chinese army was outnumbered and moved south to the Jiantian and Sunjiabang area. At that time, Japanese troops came from the south. The Chinese army then fought bravely and did not retreat. The two sides fought fiercely until 7:00 PM, when all the Japanese troops retreated. Before leaving, they burned down two villages. Also, it was reported that five Japanese boats departed from Zhouzhuang in the early morning of the day before yesterday to attack the headquarters of the Chen Regiment. The Second Battalion stationed in Changqu and the special service company of the regiment headquarters jointly resisted and sank one enemy boat. After a fierce battle until around 11:00 AM, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated. In this battle, the Japanese army captain Yokoyama was killed, and the company commander Zhao of the First Battalion of the Chen Regiment was also killed in action.</p>
<h3>Emergency Epidemic Hospital Ends - All Sectors Hope It Will Not Be Closed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Wenshi Road, sponsored by the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city, not only provides free medical treatment and medicine and does not charge registration fees, but also provides food, lodging, and medicine for seriously ill inpatients. The total number of beds in the general and branch hospitals exceeds 200. Since its opening in July, it has treated a total of more than 69,000 patients, benefiting the poor and sick, and its achievements are outstanding. However, the hospital originally planned to focus on emergency epidemic prevention during the summer and to operate for three months. Therefore, at the second board of directors meeting of the hospital on the 17th of this month, it was decided that the hospital would be closed as scheduled at the end of September. After this news spread, all sectors were extremely concerned. They all believed that the hospital had complete equipment, and no fees were charged for diagnosis or medicine. Once it closed, the poor and sick would lose a completely free place to seek medical treatment. In recent days, various groups and institutions have been sending telegrams to inquire about the truth, hoping that the hospital can provide long-term medical treatment and be transformed into an emergency hospital for civilians. It is heard that Mr. Xu Xiaochu, the director of the hospital, is considering ways to make this happen.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Hotel Opens Today</h3>

<h3>"Strike" and "Greasing the Palm"</h3>
<p>— Ding Ren</p>
<p>The "strike" trend in Shanghai this year has reached a "seasonal" stage, occurring continuously. Whenever a wave of increased living costs hits, those who sell their labor have to struggle to survive, resulting in labor disputes. However, these labor disputes are by no means instigated or willingly caused by the workers themselves. On the contrary, the labor side always endures until it can no longer bear it before making demands—demands for the minimum conditions for survival.</p>
<p>Of course, enlightened employers feel that everyone should make concessions and work together harmoniously to overcome the current difficulties. But there are also a few employers who do not consider the overall situation and stubbornly cling to their prejudices, leading to a situation where it is impossible to back down. Here, the writer does not take sides with either party, but feels that the problem should be viewed on a larger and more long-term scale. "At this time and in this place," everyone should live in harmony and not create a situation where "the fence is broken, and wild dogs can sneak in," which would benefit a third party. At the same time, the emergence of labor disputes fundamentally has its social roots—external blockades, monopolies, coupled with the speculative manipulation of short-sighted capitalists, adding fuel to the fire and causing it to blaze. As a result, strikes and other events that affect social security and order occur. Therefore, both labor and management should clearly see the crux of the problem and seek a peaceful solution with the utmost tolerance.</p>
<p>From the shutdown of the Wing On and Hongzhang spinning mills in March of this year to the present, for the past six months, we have managed to progress along this line of bare subsistence, without much change, and therefore have been able to coexist peacefully. At the end of last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council announced the "cost of living index" for July and August, which generally showed an increase of 40 to 50 percent compared to the first half of this year. Coupled with the recent soaring rice prices, this is certainly the main cause of the current tram workers' strike. At the same time, if this situation continues to develop, with families crying out for food and driven by the instinct to survive, it is difficult to guarantee that other issues will not arise. Therefore, the writer believes that when a wave of increased living costs hits, both labor and management should recognize the fundamental causes mentioned above and make concessions—everyone should reduce their own waste, and employers should also abandon the "quota system" (the insistence on earning a certain amount, otherwise not doing business). This is an unreasonable and stubborn prejudice. The labor side generally wastes less on a daily basis, but should not make excessive demands that cause social unrest. As mentioned earlier, we must prevent a "third party from benefiting"—in the circumstances of "preparing for a rainy day" and relying on each other, so that both labor and management can survive!</p>
<p>Here are some humble opinions regarding the tram company's labor dispute:</p>
<p>First, the employer should increase the normal living allowance for employees, thereby reducing the unexpected income (greasing the palm) of ticket sellers and others. In this way, it may not be a loss for the company, but rather a benefit. The specific amounts of the normal allowance and salary can be announced in writing by the company, so that the public can judge what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>Second, the labor side can cultivate the virtue of not "greasing the palm," which is crucial. Ticket sellers often squander money on "flower clubs" and "gambling dens" because "greasing the palm" is so easy. The writer has often heard about this on the tram. But once the income is fixed, the labor side will feel the need to save, resulting in an unexpected effect, perhaps even exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>Third, from the perspective of the passengers, if the company's earnings are a certain figure (calculated according to foreign exchange rates), and expenses increase, but "greasing the palm" continues as before, then "the wool comes from the sheep," and the unfortunate ones are of course the passengers. But the passengers' shoulders will no longer be able to bear the burden. Therefore, as long as the company's treatment of the labor side is deemed fair "at this time and in this place," then the passengers' supervision of the ticket sellers' "greasing the palm" will become their own business. In this way, the company will not suffer losses, the ticket sellers' income can be averaged, and the tram fares will not be increased again and again, leaving passengers with a strong sense of "difficulty in traveling"!</p>
<p>If we can proceed according to the above principles, not only can the trend of "greasing the palm" be curbed, but future labor disputes can also be avoided, and even social security can be greatly improved.</p>
<h3>The Good Fortune of People in "Isolated Island"</h3>
<p>— Tong Guang</p>
<h3>Hawthorne's Investigation</h3>
<h3>The Dancer's Destiny</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>At this moment, of course, I couldn't stand still. I simply followed behind Little Li, walking towards the person coming. My heart felt a little strange, but I remained calm. My head was lowered, my hands were in my pockets, clutching the small pistol, and I deliberately slowed my pace.</p>
<p>I was only five or six steps away from the person coming. I casually looked up and saw that the tall person was wearing a dark blue woolen long gown, a brown felt hat with the brim pulled low, light tea-colored glasses, and still sporting a short mustache. He was wearing pointed-toe purple leather shoes, and his jaw was indeed square and broad. This person was Zhao Boxiong!</p>
<p>Since Little Li was walking in front of me, he would naturally make contact with him first. Zhao Boxiong suddenly raised his hand and said to Little Li, "Open the door."</p>
<p>Little Li stopped and hesitated, as if unable to answer for a moment. He paused, then stammered, "The door is open. There—there is a friend inside."</p>
<p>Little Li's hesitation and stammering would naturally arouse the person's suspicion. He also stopped and hesitated for a moment. "A friend? What's his name?"</p>
<p>Little Li reluctantly replied, "He—he didn't say. He said he wanted to see your master and told me to open the door—he's wearing a Western suit and has some black stubble—"</p>
<p>By this time, I had already walked close to his side. The situation did not allow me to pause, and I could only continue forward. Could I retreat and notify Hawthorne? That was certainly impossible. In fact, since Hawthorne had arrangements for internal and external coordination, he certainly wouldn't need me to notify him. As I brushed past him, I felt him looking at me from the corner of his eye. Of course, I couldn't look back at him, but I believed that all my nerves were fully tense at this moment, especially my auditory nerves were particularly sensitive.</p>
<p>He continued to ask, "Is he alone?" Little Li seemed not to answer, the answer was probably expressed through actions. Zhao Boxiong continued to ask, "How long has he been here?"</p>
<p>"He just arrived—less than five minutes ago." This was Little Li's reply, which I overheard with my face turned away. (117)</p>
<h3>Service and Making Money</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>It is said that "people should work in society with the purpose of 'service,' and should not talk about 'making money.' Mentioning money is not 'noble' enough." It seems that this statement is only suitable for those with bulging bellies to say. How can it be applied to the proletariat who eats one day at a time?</p>
<p>In today's society, where all living necessities have to be bought with money, we should of course "serve" to increase production. But at the same time, we should also know how to "make money" to stabilize our lives. Therefore, the way to "make money," except for not selling our souls and engaging in shameless activities, is actually the deserved reward for "service."</p>
<p>The amount of "money made" is directly proportional to the breadth of "service." But in fact, there are many "special classes" who "serve" lightly, or even do nothing all day, and earn a lot of money. There are also the so-called "exploited classes" who "serve" heavily but cannot earn enough to maintain the minimum cost of living. Therefore, we should seek the truth of balancing "service" and "making money" in order to thoroughly reduce much unease and evil. That is, to oppose the unprovoked exploitation of people's service opportunities, and to expose the masks of those who carry many beautiful names and deceive people into "serving" while they go hungry.</p>
<h3>Pleading to Nurse an "Orphan"</h3>
<p>I am an ordinary merchant with a monthly salary of only thirty dollars. With the high cost of everything, my wife and I are usually diligent and thrifty, and we can barely get by. Unfortunately, my wife was pregnant, and on the morning of the second of this month at four o'clock, she was about to give birth. After inquiring everywhere, I learned that the 医院 (hospital) was the most economical and very reliable. Unexpectedly, something happened suddenly, and at half past six in the afternoon, my poor wife passed away. I am overcome with grief and pain. The most tragic thing is the child without a mother, who is currently in the hospital. Although it really costs one dollar per day, we cannot afford to stay and raise him for long, and they have urged us to leave the hospital several times. I live on this isolated island and have no close friends or relatives. Also, because shipping to my hometown is blocked, I am filled with sorrow and have no appropriate solution. I thought about taking the child to the orphanage, but I cannot bear to part with my own flesh and blood. If I hire a wet nurse, I cannot afford it. If he is discharged from the hospital and cries for food, what should I do? I humbly beg a mother with milk to have great compassion and nurse him for me. I will be eternally grateful and will pay you monthly. Or if there is a suitable nursery, please point me in the right direction. I would be deeply grateful and eagerly await your response.

<h3>Contributing to General Readers on the Issue of Postage</h3>
<p>— Wang Jichiao</p>
<p>(1) Postage Due: Recently, the number of postage due items has been increasing. Recently, this publication carried a detailed explanation by a gentleman of the reasons for postage due, which is commendable and convenient for the public. The biggest reason for postage due is that the new version of postage stamps no longer has gum on the back. Users often still use saliva to stick them on and put them in the mailbox, which inevitably leads to them falling off. I have encountered this twice. Therefore, I urge the public to be sure to use adhesive to stick them on, so as to avoid the recipient having to pay double the postage. (In this way, each piece of mail costs three times the postage for both parties.)</p>
<p>(2) Surcharge: The price increase for postage was officially scheduled to take effect on October 1st of this year. The Shanghai Post Office raised prices early on September 23rd. I don't know why. Today's newspaper reported that the Shanghai Post Office's in-charge authorities stated, "The ministry's order stated that it should be implemented immediately upon receipt of the order," which is a misinterpretation of the law. When the central government promulgates a law, it must specify an effective date. China is vast, and the central and border regions are far apart. The authorities are deeply concerned that some provinces may not have received the order by the effective date. Therefore, the order states, "Upon receipt of the order, immediately implement it and report it," which is a common phrase in official documents and should not be misinterpreted. This order to increase prices should be implemented on October 1st for those who receive it before October 1st. If the order is received after October 1st, then the price should be increased on the day the order is received. This is the correct approach. If other issues are involved, it seems that this document is superfluous!</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Yu Chu</p>
<p>There are three Peking Opera plays in which the protagonist, after death, stands stiff as a corpse and only falls after the enemy kneels before the corpse: Hua Yun in "Battle of Taiping," Yang Qilang in "Two Wolf Mountain," and Lu Deng in "Lu'an Prefecture." Among the three, Hua Yun and Lu Deng both died by suicide. Yang Qilang was tied to a banana tree and shot to death with a volley of arrows. Because they were all loyal ministers of their time, the plays show their loyalty and courage by having their corpses stand upright after death to reveal this. Among them, Lu Deng's refusal to fall is the most meaningful, because it is enough to move Jin Wuzhu to adopt Sui Ziwenlong as his adopted son and preserve the descendants of the Lu family. Yang Qilang, after being shot by arrows, still wanted Pan Hong to call him grandfather three times before falling to the ground, which seems too childish. Before Hua Yun died, Chen Youliang persuaded him to surrender, but he spoke impolitely, saying that if Chen's sister was willing to marry him, he would agree to the request, which also seems to lack the demeanor of a great general.</p>
<p>Bao Gong, as seen on the stage, mostly wears a black full beard. There is only one play each in which he wears a white full beard and does not wear a beard: "Longevity Star" and "Strange Injustice Reported." "Longevity Star," also known as "Lady Dowager Bids Farewell to the Court," is a standard play for old men. It is rarely seen in Shanghai, except for an occasional performance by Zhang Shaoquan. Bao Gong wears a white beard in this play and is in a supporting role, so he is not noticed. In "Strange Injustice Reported," Bao Gong's official position is only magistrate of Dingyuan County, a low position. He is newly debuted and has not been in office for long, so he does not wear a beard to show that he is young. However, when Yuan Shihai played the role in Huangjin, he wore a black beard. I don't know which is correct.</p>
<p>Actors who specialize in red-faced roles must also be skilled in Yue Fei plays and declining old man plays. There is a reason for this. Most actors who play red-faced roles have dull voices, or are bright but lack charm, and are unable to handle the standard old man plays. Therefore, they have to lean towards the heavy-acting and posture-based Guan plays. Yue Fei and Guan Gong only have the difference between the rubbed face and the original face. Their demeanor is quite similar, and they both have the appearance of being majestic, dignified, loyal, and awe-inspiring. This is why those who are good at acting in Guan plays must be good at acting in the role of Yue Fei. As for declining old man plays, they also emphasize acting rather than singing, which is in line with their conditions, so they can also be skilled in them.</p>
<h3>Entertainment News from the Provisional Capital</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhengyu from Chongqing</p>

<h3>Eccentricities of Hollywood Directors</h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>Many famous people in the world often have some strange temperaments or habits. There are quite a few celebrities in Hollywood. Now let us start with the quirks of the directors.</p>
<p>Cecil B. DeMille: One of the pockets on the right side of his clothes always had many coins in it. Whenever he was shooting a scene, his right hand was always in his pocket, using two fingers to play with a half-dollar silver coin.</p>
<p>William Dieterle: When shooting a scene, his whole body was as tense as a hunting dog, his arms were straight, and he was biting his lips, sometimes his upper lip and sometimes his lower lip.</p>
<p>Frank Borzage: Every time he shoots a new film, he always has a new behavior. Sometimes he always carries a bamboo cane, and while watching others work, he keeps turning the cane in his hand.</p>
<p>King Henry is even more peculiar. Every time a scene is finished, he takes off his gold-rimmed glasses and stares deeply at the place where the scene was just filmed.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd: Whenever he is shooting a scene, his head is always down, and he does not take off his hat. He walks back and forth silently next to the camera, like a tamed beast.</p>
<p>William Keighley: When he is nervous, he grips his pipe tightly in his hand, as if a child is holding his mother's hand for comfort.</p>
<p>John Ford is the most solemn director. He also has a quirk. His pockets are always filled with small paper clips. He takes them out one by one, straightens them, and puts them between his teeth to bite lightly.</p>
<p>The remaining great directors, Ernst Lubitsch, John Stahl, and others, all have very strange and interesting habits. Let’s talk about them next time.</p>
<h3>More on Chen Delin's Disciples</h3>
<p>— Gu Yu</p>
<p>The earliest of Chen Delin's disciples were Ding Jifu and Yang Yuebo. Both of these people were outsiders (in fact, Ding had sung in operas before, so he can also be said to be an insider). Chen's "Filial Piety" record for Baidai was actually recorded under Ding's name. Among Wang Yaoqing, Wang Qinong, Wang Huifang, Mei Lanfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and Yao Yufu, Yaoqing never admitted to being Delin's disciple, and said, "I even taught Delin opera in the palace." Han Shichang and Huang Guiqiu were both acknowledged by Chen. As for Jiang Junjia, he was only a disciple on one side. Later, there were also Li Xiangyun and Hong Funu. Chen had served as a teacher at the Binqing Society, so Xu Biyun and Yu Bulan can also be said to have received instruction from Chen.</p>
<p>It is said that only Huang Guiqiu and Li Xiangyun officially went through the apprenticeship ceremony. Hong Funu had issued invitations, but the offer was retracted when they discovered she was a prostitute. Shang Xiaoyun once talked about becoming a disciple, but Chen was displeased with her due to a certain matter and dismissed her. Shang and Chen were estranged for several years because of this (unpaid).</p>

<h3>Sketch of Storytelling Figure: Yan Xueting</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiale</p>
<p>In today's entertainment world, storytelling also occupies a considerable position. Storytelling venues are numerous, radio programs are increasing, young heroes are emerging one after another, and there are reviews in various publications. All of these are good proofs. Yan Xueting is one who is working hard for the storytelling world. He is Xu Yunzhi's prized disciple. He became famous in Shanghai soon after his debut. Now, although he has not been working for many years, he has become extremely popular. You can hear his programs on the radio almost anytime. As for why he is so popular, what is the reason? According to my personal analysis, there are no more than the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Natural Good Voice: When he sings, his crisp and sweet voice really has some seductive power. And he sings from morning to night without any flaws. This is of course the biggest factor in his popularity.</p>
<p>(2) Eloquent: Whether he is narrating or playing a role, his words are very clear. Especially when playing the role of a young lady from a wealthy family, his artistic talent is even more evident. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>(3) Popular Opening: When he sings the opening on the radio, he often adopts popular and humorous openings, such as Jiangbei couples scolding each other and the hundred-head opening. They are all already very popular. Therefore, it has attracted a large number of fans. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>(4) Exquisite Costumes: The old listeners in the storytelling venue can see his exquisite and clean costumes every day, as if he is getting married every day, dressed in splendor. However, because of this, it has attracted a part of the audience. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope Yan Xueting will not only focus on innovating his clothing, but should work hard on the artistic side. Then it will not be difficult to become a leader among the rising stars!</p>

<h3>Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera (1): Eighteen Mile Send-Off</h3>
<p>— Written and Illustrated by Yunxiu</p>
<p>Zhu Yingtai disguised herself as a man and went to Hangzhou to study, where she became close friends with her classmate Liang Shanbo.</p>
<p>This play is a story about Liang Shanbo sadly bidding farewell to Zhu Yingtai when she dropped out of school and returned home.</p>
<p>During the reluctant farewell, Miss Zhu frequently revealed the truth; she even pointed to the "birds perching on the branches" and boldly sang, "The male is like Brother Liang, and the female is like my body." However, Liang Shanbo, this fool, remained unaware and still thought that Zhu Yingtai was hitting on him (see picture).</p>
<p>(2) Meeting at the Pavilion</p>
<p>There were quite a few days between Liang Zhu's "Eighteen Mile Send-Off" and their reunion at the "Pavilion." Liang Shanbo had by this time learned the truth from the teacher's wife and took the embroidered object left by Zhu Yingtai to propose marriage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he arrived too late, and the wrong was already done! Zhu Yingtai had already been betrothed to Ma Wencai by her autocratic father.</p>
<p>Liang Shanbo sang angrily, "Although you have promised Wencai for life, if the Ma family doesn't carry you, I won't carry you, if the Ma family wants to carry you, I will carry you..." This refreshing singing is familiar to girls who love to listen to Yue Opera.</p>
