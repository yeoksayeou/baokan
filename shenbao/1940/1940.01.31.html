<h3>大可注目之淺間丸案</h3>
<p>英日兩國之間，茲發生所謂淺間丸案；日本朝野鼓噪至於張脈僨興，英倫當局委蛇至於啼笑皆非；今後固將如何開展，如何着落，其複雜，其嚴重，殆不免波動及於雙方之內政外交；雖視爲試金石，亦無不可。論案情：事理極單調，性質極輕微。此在平時，莫謂第一二流政治家外交家所不屑取爲國際問題；况乎今日，日本方以對華侵略爲唯一重心，英國方以對德作戰爲唯一亟務；即在報人亦必視此類事爲小値論，平時猶然，今日史不暇論此。顧乃英日激盪，遐邇注目，幾有當前大事之觀者，何歟？</p>
<p>時在一旬之前，即本月廿一日午；地在日本千葉縣外，距岸三十五海里之公海；事緣日本商輪淺間丸爲英艦所邀截檢查，拘去兵役年齡內之德國人二十一名。所謂淺間丸案之本體，洵若是之單調輕微者也。原單調與否，輕微與否，無定義，無標準；然比之中日未嘗宣戰而日本空軍轟炸掃射英國之駐華大使，拘捕覊押英國之使館武官，封鎖天津之英國租界，侵損各地之英僑資產，日艦復於香港口外頻頻攔查英國商輪，以此種種，相提而並論之，則正式宣戰之交戰國軍艦在公海內檢查中立國商輪，拘禁敵國壯丁，如淺間丸所遭遇者，雖欲不視之爲單調輕微事件不可得也。英國之所以爲此舉解釋辯白者，一曰國際法規，二曰國際法規，三亦曰國際法規。日本之所鼓噪者一曰國際法規之疑問也，二曰英國對日本之「重大非友誼行爲」也，三曰，損及日本威望也，辱及帝國人民也，挑釁也，輕蔑也，國交嚴重也，感情惡化也，不可忍也，不可恕也。夫以本案本體之單調輕微，記者殊未欲參論其短長，平亭其是非；然以英國拘泥者如彼，日本咆哮者若此；甚至如昨日倫敦電訊所傳。英國惟恐覆牃之或將刺激日方輿情，竟不敢公開宣示覆牒內容；然則今日之所謂淺間丸案者，問題不在其單調輕微之本體而別有所在矣。是未可以輕淺間丸案而輕之！</p>
<p>如何開展？如何着落？莫得而逆覩；「倫教消息靈通人士咸謂仍有趨於嚴重之可能！」當然，此所謂嚴重，英日雙方決不爲德國二十一壯丁而鬬爭作戰。日本決不以海軍奪取德人，用伸意願，亦必不以海軍拘捕英人，而資報復。英國決不派遣曾被日本創辱之大使武官軍艦，馳赴東京，反詰日本。嚴重之程度，自不至此；折衷之妥協，則所難期。蓋英國在此戰時，凡百以有裨戰事，爭取勝利爲第一義；故於國際法規所承認之交戰國權利，絲毫不甘放棄。以美國對待英國之厚，以英國期待美國之殷，而於美國所感覺不快之事件，如檢查寄德郵件問題，檢查美輪手績問題，英國皆不虞其損及美國威望感情等等，無一不與美國斤較量。以此衡之，謂英國對日本，豈將視爲比美國更可畏敬，更應優惠之國家；竟爾破例捐棄其國際法規之論據，釋放所拘德國壯丁以遷就日本所鼓噪之威望感情等等耶？信若是，英國何異畫供於世界曰：誰向英國咆哮鼓噪者，英國敝屣國際法規可也；英國惟日本與日本式之態度是憚，而休休有容若美國者，相應不理可也。英國宜不若是。雖然，歧途當前，是可爲英國之立國精神，英國之對日政策，英國之對遠東乃至對其他一切之政策，作反應透剔之試金石。</p>
<p>至於日本：言威望，則旣以本國之威望爲至尊無對，遂視他國之威望爲不値一顧，顧復遇事小題大做而輒好輕言威望。言民氣，則以民間輿情爲最易擒縱，遂遇事輕加鼓煽，殊不知其危險無殊玩火。對英國，又敬又愛又怨又恨；以侵華之棘手而對英內荏，復以歐戰之機會而對英色厲。對德國，非不痛心於去秋之突然被賣；然爲對付英國計，爲維持頻年標榜親德政策之體面計，事關德人者，輒故意示人以輕憐密愛，眷戀無窮。凡此種種，茲不必多所評騭；抑日本豈無達人，自知甚明，何待旁觀者提撕警悟；然淺間丸案所由超越其本體而形成今日之緊張嚴重者，亦即以此種種爲重要因素。事已至此，東京當局自必盡其對於國家之熱誠忠藎，竭力折衝；然對英交涉之成敗，初非日本片面所得決定，况英艦所拘德人已解香港，更非日本所克强而致之；是日本對於本案，謂有多大熒譽，而光明之前途，實屬不敢代爲樂觀。雖然，日本當局固將悍然不顧一切，以種種直接問接之行動方法，對付英人，處理本案乎？抑將以理智修正其所鼓噪咆哮，而稍戢其威望感情之高調乎？能控制旣縱之民氣乎？能鎭壓將開之國會乎？自民間輿情以迄國會議政，能恰守本案範圍，就事論事，而對當局不作求全責備乎？抑將以不慊於當局之重要政策，徒以有所忌憚，未便正面譏彈，爰就本案，借題發揮，不恤釀成閣潮以及他種更嚴重之風波乎？淺間丸案豈特日本現階段內政外交之試金石，抑政海暗礁不啻也。</p>
<h3>美注視中日戰爭　將力阻攫華嘗試　海部要求核准大海軍案　禁運問題參院秘密計論</h3>

<h3>復興中的浙西教育（二）</h3>
<p>本學期一中學生共有七百四十七八人、初中三級、高中一級、都是男女兼收、二中學生四百五十人、僅設初中、不收女生、三中也祗設初中、但兼收女生、一共有學生二百七十餘人、三所中學、都不收學費、膳雜等費高中爲每學期四十三元、初中爲四十元、但凡已淪陷之各縣境內的學生、或戰區各縣學生中家　清貧的、可以聲請救濟、救濟分甲乙丙丁四種、甲種救濟可得救濟費每年八十六元、乙種救濟每年可得救濟費六十八元、丙種救濟四十案元、丁種救濟二十七元、總計三校一千四百多個學生中間、救濟生約佔百分之四十五、而在全部救濟生中間、受甲種救濟的約佔百分之六十、拿救濟生的籍貫來說、最多的事長興·富陽·孝豐·安吉·杭縣市·平湖·和餘杭各縣、</p>
<p>浙西設立戰時中學、除了救濟淪陷區和戰區的失學青年外、在政治上的意義、尤為重大、淪陷區的青年、不斷地來到後方求學、使奴化教育無從施展、另一方面、一般學生得到國家的救濟、安心求學、使他們的家長、雖然不幸身在淪陷區、仍舊對祖國懷着無限的眷念、因而使整個淪陷區的民眾堅定起抗戰一定能夠勝利的信念、但從淪陷區和戰區的學生非常眾多、三所中學無論如何不夠容納、而且學生長途跋涉、冒險穿越日人的防綫、每不能趕來投考、程度年齡和證明文件、又每多不能符合規定的資格和手續、實在使學校當局十分困難、現在浙西行署、正在籌設青年招待所、招收戰區青年、稍施訓練、就代為介紹職業或報送受訓學校、省教育廳方面、也正在準備添設吳興中學和嘉興中學、並且還要在浙西設立師範學校、既可救濟失學青年、又可培養小學師資、實在是一舉二得的事、極希望能夠早日實現、至於招收青年入學的辦法、以杭縣為最好、在每學期接到浙西三個中學招生通知之後、縣黨政當局立刻派人到淪陷區去宣傳、並招收失學青年、聚成一處、由政府派人伴送到投考地點考試、待考試完畢、凡不能錄的、取由政府商得學生家長同意、介紹或報送別處受訓工作、如若願意回家的、也由原人伴送回家、善言安慰、鼓勵他下次再考、凡投考所需食宿用資費用、完全由政府方面負擔、能夠如此、則學校當局既可省却許多困難、學生方面、亦可得到種種便利、希望各縣當局、都能仿照這個辦法施行、使能充分打到搶救青年的任務、</p>
<p>在浙西的中等教育中有一件事值得我們特別提出的、就是吳興的基督教三一社主持人美國霍約翰君所創辦的三一社補習中學、霍約翰君在吳興主持三一社的事業、已有四十多年、戰前三一社本來設有補習中學一所、頗為社會人士所稱許、吳興淪陷的時候、霍氏遷居莫干山、不久就回到那裏、恢復三一社會堂的各種事業、其中最重要的就是恢復三一社補習中學和附屬小學、二年以來、中小學生數增加到一千餘人、而日偽設立的中學、却門可羅雀、學生十分稀少、而且三一社中小學所用的教科書都是霍約翰氏、親自到上海去採辦的商務中華課本、因之日人恨之刺骨、屢次派軍隊、前去圖搜查搗亂、都給霍氏嚴詞拒絕、並且親自到日憲兵隊去交涉、有一次、日人的憲兵隊長問他、「你這所校辦到什麽時候為止呢、」他回答得很妙、他說、「你們什麽時候走、我就什麽時候停辦、日本人一天在湖州、我就要一天辦下去、」那個憲兵隊長也沒有辦法、霍氏每天在校中舉行晨會的時候常向學生講述抗戰必勝的理由、最近我看他呈省教育廳請求准予立案的呈文、其中學生名冊、教職員履歷、教科書版本、以及各種照片圖冊、極為詳盡、不過該校設在淪陷區、不是中國政府法令和視導所能達到、事實上恐怕不可能予以立案、不過希望教廳方面、能夠變通辦法、多予以精神上的鼓勵、來答謝這位可敬的異國的友人、</p>

<h3>以葡輪行駛各口岸　日加緊壟斷航運　另行組織中葡航運公司　經理則為日人統制一切</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日方壟斷中國沿海與河道中之航運、將於兩週內續進一步、蓋已往九月內、在本市水面被日海軍所扣留之葡船十二艘、將併入日方控制之中葡航運公司也、此等向葡萄牙登記之船隻、均係木質、大多建造於十至二十年前、其載重鮮有在三百噸以上者、前在長江口與</p>
<p>沿海附近口岸來往、營業頗盛、今中葡航運公司行將成立、其主任為東亞海運會社經理山中、副主任則屬葡人、惟各船仍保持其向葡國登記之名義、以免有傷民族感情、各船今泊浦東與吳淞間、其中五艘、先被日海軍指爲</p>
<p>私運貨物與軍器接濟上海四週游擊隊而遭扣留、日海軍旋對其餘諸船、復以「調查其身份」爲言、同加扣留、自去夏起、葡領署即與日海軍當局談判釋放各船、因條件不合而未果、至去年十一月間、葡方終行讓步、而商妥成立中葡航運公司、大權將操諸日海軍當局所委</p>
<p>田中之手當葡日雙方談判時、第三國航運公司頗覺不安、本市除英商大航運公司之船隻、殆均屬英國者外、尙有義商航運公司、經營船隻十艘、與德商經營之船隻七艘、其中</p>
<p>華人資本頗巨、航運界相信中葡航運公司若告成功、則日方或將沒收他船、而在「東亞新秩序」之護符下、復進一步、逐漸剝奪第三國之航業、</p>
<h3>寗波安靜　昨傳日機轟炸　來電均未提及</h3>
<p>日前本市曾盛傳日機空襲寗波之說、旋航業界接電證明係屬不確、詛昨晨滬市方面、又有日機轟炸寗波之謠傳、致甬籍人士紛相探詢、情頗關切、經大光社記者向航業界探悉、昨日上午、各輪公司所接甬方電吿、不下十餘通、均稱寗波安靜、絕未提及日機轟炸之說、故可證明前項謠傳係絕對不確、况昨日甬市亦飛大雪、氣候晦暗、日機根本無法活動、</p>
<h3>風雪載途飢寒交迫　救難嚴重關頭　慈幼會施衣秩序井然　平糶捐款有六十五萬　放振饅首改在華路</h3>
<p>滬市連日氣候凛冽、凍斃者纍纍、昨更風雪載途、平民無衣無食、勢難渡歲、幸各慈善機關暨各界善士、同時施衣施飯、昕夕舉辦、不遑寗處、嘉慰難胞、共襄義舉、慈幼協會施捨童衣、待領者無慮數百、均列隊候領、秩序井然、慕爾堂施飯、人更擁擠、領振饅首者每晚增加、已至六千餘人、</p>
<p>平糶米額</p>
<p>上海平糶委員會為持久辦理平糶積極勸募捐款後、新聲社記者昨向該會秘書處探悉、（一）勸募捐款、各業認定暨個人自動捐助者、總約國幣六十五萬元、已繳收款機關者約國幣五十五萬元現期望各界本己飢己溺之心、爲輸粟輸金之舉、源源樂助、實爲本埠貧民之幸也、（二）購進糶米、第一次購進現貨二萬零零六十八包、訂貨一萬五千包、已抵滬堆存棧房、第二批購進現貨五千包、訂貨一萬一千包、約一月初十邊到滬、總共購進包括現貨訂貨、共五萬一千零六十八包、（三）兩租界內五十個平糶處、決繼續辦理平糶、每日每處以五十包爲限、售價每元仍爲六斤半、平糶時間仍爲下午一時起至六時糶完爲止、</p>
<p>施振饅首</p>
<p>據慈善團體聯合會發表消息稱、該會每晚在新大沽路散振饅首以來、人數逐增至六千餘人、每晚放振饅首之麵粉、增至五十袋、而後來居上、殊有難於爲繼之勢、甚望社會熱心人士、源源捐助、因待振人數之每日增多、新大沽路一帶、有難容納若輩逗遛之槪、故該會已決定自今晚起、將放振饅首地點、改在愛文義路大華路口散放、時間仍爲下午七時至八時、尙希待振貧民注意、又該會昨承趙晋卿君等、將增積聚餐會聚餐費一百十元、指捐充救濟貧民饅首之需、</p>
<p>呼籲救難</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會同業組勸募委員會、爲呼籲各業公會及各大商號、節省年夜飯筳筳資、救濟難胞、昨特致函各業同業公會云、「敬啟者、荏苒光陰、父屆歲暮、習俗均有吃年夜飯之舉、去歲本會鑒於難民問題頗爲嚴重、曾分函並登報呼籲、請節省年夜飯筵資、移作救難費用、幸賴各業、各大商號洞察時艱、熱心公益、慷慨從事、集有成數、爲難胞造福、實匪淺鮮、而邇來國難未除、物價飛漲、使　胞生活更感威脅、際此歲暮、吾人雖有吃年夜飯之財力、推惻隱之心、人皆有之、一念　窩難胞、飢寒交迫、則佳餚在前、亦何忍下咽、用特再度呼籲、素仰貴會對於救難向極熱心、諸同業商號亦慈悲爲懷、故祈積極推行、共襄義舉、將年夜飯筵資竭力節省、移作救難費用、並望將該項節省資費、一面逕交廣東路九十三號上海難民救濟協會外、一面函報本會以資稽考、無任公感、」</p>
<h3>長江開放　日發言人宣稱　當在二月以內</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日方昨（廿九日）晚招待新聞記者席上、或問、重行開放長江以供外船航行之決定、是否有何改變、或取銷前議、日軍發言人答稱、就上海所知、長江將於二月間重行開放、如東京原來宣布者然、而確實開放時、當由東京予以宣布、聞與此問題有關之許多詳則、今在研究中、去年十二月間首次宣布長江的於兩月後開放、則其開放日期、當在本年二月間、上海方面並未接獲與上述者相反之消息、</p>
<h3>華捕槍擊韓人　起訴不確　巡捕執行職務　有權盡其職責</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日方昨（二十九日）傳本月二十八日午後在廣東路向韓人金淸根（譯音）開槍之公共租界某華捕、將被起訴一說、頃由警務處加以否認、據稱、巡捕有此權力、檢擊韓人、乃盡其職責云、按該韓人年二十九歲、身穿中裝、二十八日午後、在廣東路河南路　近見巡捕搜查隊行近、拔步飛奔、致足部被華捕擊中一彈、旋經救火會救護車送入福民醫院、</p>
<h3>英輪被扣案　卽將交涉　英大使館消息　正在研究報告</h3>
<p>大陸報云、關於日艦一艘、上星期三日在福建海外攔阻怡和公司英輪永生號、並派兵登輪事、本市英海軍當局、不久將向日當局交涉、昨（二十九日）據英大使館發言人稱、所云即將交涉一語、若認含有提出抗議之意、則屬不確、因此事之詳細報吿、今在研究中，至於將以何種方式交涉、則尙未決定、或將口頭交涉、或則書面交涉云、聞英海軍當局對於此事、已與日海軍當道有所接觸、</p>
<h3>日方威脅言論　對租界控制反日不滿意　竟謂考慮應付現局行動</h3>
<p>字林報云、日陸軍發言人、昨日（二十十九日）聲稱、上海日陸軍官員對於公共租界與法租界中控制反日份子、未必滿意、刻正研究辦法、並考慮對付此種局面之行動、至於</p>
<p>此等辦法維何、則以渠所處地位、不能予以披露、但觀於公共租界與法租界之性質、此項問題、不能由日方單獨解決、或問此間局勢將否釀成相類於今對天津英法租界所施之封鎖、發言人答稱、此純屬</p>
<p>假想問題渠不加答覆、天津日軍司令認為有加封鎖之必要、故實施封鎖步驟其旨趣已經明白說明、即杜防反日份子進入日方所佔區域是已、</p>
<h3>奎松總統輪未沉　擱淺後受重傷　船　身下陷海水浸入</h3>
<p>前傳在日本洋面鹿兒島附近、觸礁沈沒之菲輪奎松號、昨據該輪本市之代理行怡和洋行外洋船頭部、接在日之船員來電報吿、謂該輪係擱淺並非觸礁、惟擱入沙灘後、船身後部下陷、船頭昂起、船身受損甚重、海水浸入、船員等已經由日輪救出、脫險赴日、至於該輪之拖洩修理等事宜、怡和洋行係代理行、並無主張、故須聽候菲律賓總行定零、</p>
<h3>滇越鐵路　慢車恢復通行　惟須在白塞及小龍潭換車　快車及貨車尙無恢復日期</h3>
<p>滇越鐵路中國段（即係由河口至昆明）、自經日機轟炸後、在彎塘與白塞閒略毀鐵橋一座、橋面無損、路軌亦已修復、橋脚鐵架、則尙在修換中、較重車輛、尙不能通行、預期最近期內即可完全修復、</p>
<p>炸毀鐵橋　又離小龍潭車站約一公路、炸墜鐵橋一座、橋樑靠小龍潭一端、墜在急流中、他端尙擱在對岸、鐵路公司用木袈自岸旁搭至橋樑墜落處上、再在鐵橋斜軌上架設木梯、以便行人、過橋尙稱安全、此段約在二三個月後、方可修復、以是由河口至昆明、沿途計須換車二次、故該路快車及貨車仍在停頓中、恢復日期、尤難頂期、</p>
<p>慢車通行　至慢車則已恢復行車、由海防至老街間（越段）之行車時刻、則仍照常、最快一日可達、次晨七時左右、火車由河口開出、第一次須在白塞換車、時間約在上午十一時左右、此處僅係橋樑損壞、可用渡船擺渡、唯無小工可僱、須在白寨站帶用該處鄕民同往相助、並無十分不便、第三日晨由開遠開車後二十分鐘、即抵毀壞地段（小龍潭）、</p>
<p>搬運行李鐵路公司僱有臨時小工約三百名、頭二三等旅客行李、由鐵路方面代爲搬運、但每人以三十公斤爲限、四等旅客行李、須自僱小工搬運、小工每人約一元、但行李如笨重、則每人二三元不定、步行約一里許、即抵換車處、換車時間侷促、乘客互相爭先、紊亂異常、行李過多致無法照顧、以致遺失、故以少帶爲妥、至由昆明至防則換車時在黑夜、其情形更見紊亂矣、</p>
<p>河口過夜又悉河口當局爲便利入境檢查起見、曾通知由防赴昆旅客、須於每日上午十時至下午二時半間過河入河口境、故旅客不能在次晨乘車至昆、須在河口暫住一日、河口旅館、僅有天然旅館一家、求過於供、非捷足先登、不能得宿處、綜觀上述、往日三日行程、最近非五日不能完成、票價增加關於潔具越路票價、亦已增加、依照每一關金合越幣二元九角計算、則由海防至昆明、頭等單程爲越幣九十一元七角八分、二等六十三元、三等三十六元另七分、四等約十三元、</p>

<h3>滬溫航行不易　由滬開溫各輪尙無消息　航輪搭客並無確定辦法</h3>
<p>自日　在浙東蕭山登陸後、滬浙航行因旅客往來之需要、漸形頻繁、昔日由滬赴浙東各地之人士、均係轉道寗波、今則因滬甬航輪搭客擁擠、購票不易、除溫籍旅客要求滬溫航輪搭乘旅客外、茲悉浙江之海鬥、亦有搭乘帆船由該處登岸、轉赴浙東各地者、一部份旅客、並擬要求滬溫航輪搭客後、如能兼灣海門、則旅途將更見便利、惟行駛滬溫綫各輪、因溫州航行、時有阻撓、且海門係封鎖之區、航輪是否能駛往台州、尙不可必、故沿途不負任何責任、運日來閒有溫屬各縣旅滬人士，請溫州旅滬同鄕會及溫籍商店、要求担保赴溫、至日前由滬開出之永華曼麗馬勒及新安納三輪、因雨雪連綿、溫州口外航行不易、故各輪公司均未接得各該輪安抵溫州之電吿、</p>
<p>招飢行李禮和洋行謀福輪、於本月十一日、由滬抵鎭海口外、過駁船時、因旅客擁擠、行李失散在各駁輪中甚多、迭由寗波稽查隊查獲通知招領、迄今尙未來領取者、尙有提匣籐匣等十三件、今特再限於十四天內、開明細帳、具保向稽查隊領取、倘逾期不領、則將所留各件、呈請拍賣、充作難民善捐、</p>
<p>禁貨罰放溫州當局對於進出口貨運、限制恭嚴、規定必須先請永嘉縣商會登記、但貨商方面以滬溫航行、行期無定、致亦有運往溫州之貨物未經事前呈請登記者、頃據航業界息、甌江出入口貨物查驗所近查得未經登記之進口貨中、禁運進口者、爲數頗多、本應照章予以扣留、爲體恤商艱、已決定分別處以按照貨價十分之一以下之罰金、現已分飭各商人如數繳納後、即可騐放</p>
<p>水雷爆發據航業界確悉、日方佈置於椒江口之水雷一具、於日前突隨潮漂流至前所山脚地方、當經沿海漁民瞥見、設法打撈、詎偶一不愼、突行爆發、炸死漁民四人、重傷一人、現附近漁民、對椒江及甌江口一帶航道、莫不視爲畏途、</p>

<h3>一九三九年　上海工業之回顧（五）　工部局年報之三</h3>
<p>自上年起，工業科與工務處開始舉辦鍋爐製造商登記：經登記之鍋爐製造商共二十三家，各聘請經核准之工程師一人，所有鍋爐之製造，應受各該工程師之監督。各廠旣經按時檢騐，其出品者當可合乎正當之圖樣，所用之鍋爐板，均經鑑定合格，其號碼由廠方於經由工程師呈請發給許可證時，向工業科報吿；製造程序，亦經監督。現在本埠出品之品質，業經提高，所有經試騐之鍋爐板，已漲價兩倍半，而猶能維持如此之成績，堪稱滿意。經發出之許可證，共計二十八起。其中有鍋爐七具，經查明已運至外埠，由此可知標準較高之鍋爐，已推行至外埠矣。嗣後本埠所有不適用之鍋爐，當漸歸淘汰；俾在本局管轄區域以內，各工廠所用鍋爐，無一不用經過試騐之鍋爐板製成，</p>
<p>工業糾紛</p>
<p>目前人民生計艱難，因此各業雜免時有糾紛發生，工業科對於此等糾紛或罷工情事，盡力設法調解。捕房特務科遇有上項糾紛時，常將案件移交工業科處理，並與該科密切合作，以期消弭，工廠勞資兩方亦常直接請東該科協助。現本市人口，過度擁擠，失業衆多，工廠中倘有風潮發生，爲公衆治安計，亟宜及早設法消滅，不可聽其蔓延。各業工廠維持業務，已感困難，故因停工而使廠方所受之損失，自應盡量减少，况失業之工人，數以萬計，方賴社會援助，則已有工作之工人，豈可喪失其餬口之機會？工業科有鑒於此，遇有工業上之糾紛，必及早派員調解，以期在事實上之可能範圍以內，防止停工，倘有罷工情事，則盡力設法使其早日復工。上年經該科調解之糾紛事件，共計五十九起，內有十二起因調解成功，未曾罷工。其餘四十七起，因罷工而損失之工作時間，計共六九·四〇六日。有案件七起，曾因工業科廠主及工人三方面訂立協定而吿解決。（完）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米愈漲愈高　粳米仍少供應爲了限價</h3>
<p>粳尖</p>
<p>昨日內地來源、因雨雪交加、運輸不便、致告斷絕、市塲人心、遂見堅昂、客販手貨旣稀、而回籠貨亦以前兩朝欲從事結束、甩價脫售、並見寥落、因之一些市貨、售方未免居奇、喊聲迭起、各貨行情乃一反前市之跌風、除厚薄粳及早晚稻等國米以被限關係、悉依限盤開四十元、各色洋米遂見栗落、一號西貢初開四十一元、收盤爲四十一元三角、二號西貢竟達四十元〇三角、火絞三十九元七角、大絞三十七元四角、東京砶尖高自三十七元六七角次至三十七元四角、米粞三十一元三角特別米?　三十七元二角三十七元、業將前市所跌之價、悉已恢復、計漲七八角至近元、糯米亦跟高三五角、香港白元已開四十元、蘆羊尖乏貨無市、</p>
<p>洋米</p>
<p>昨日新定沉寂、回籠貨因囤戶甚貪、市面續見挺俏、即現洋米雖無大量實銷、而業內外囤戶始終活躍、回籠二號原包開四十九元三角、而現二號四十元〇一角、一號四十一元二三角、均係中檔大市貨、高西貢未開而貨方喊價又須四十一元半以上、在洋米定貨合劃、到源接連之下、而米價繼漲增高、實爲囤戶及米商互相利用使然、</p>
<p>另訊</p>
<p>洋米連日不斷運到、昨日又有六千四百七十八包、由太古公司岳州輪自香港裝來、昨日下午進口、因大雪故未開艙、定今日天晴後起卸、（年）</p>
<h3>現粉更缺　回籠貨高價迭出</h3>
<p>粉現貨交易　淸、而市面則步趨俏利、蓋以各粉廠對於本街批價、尚未加增、而供應限制愈嚴、雖五十包與一百包之貨、亦須叨情挨面、殊有欲購無貨之憾、據市塲傳說、廠盤增加問題、或須待諸夏曆新年、恐增加半元尚嫌未足、則加漲一元之廠盤、不久即將實現、惟目下洋麥新定與新到絡繹不絕、未識市面究竟有無影響、在此現粉愈軋愈缺之際、囘籠貨籌碼亦愈售愈少、執貨者更爲奇貨可居、綠砲車棧單價達十二元外、兵船牌亦由十一元六角漲至十一元八角、老車牌棧單則同鮮榮辱、</p>
<p>麥市交易、亦見沉靜、蓋以目下來源時阻、存底稀薄、貨主一味堅持、不肯輕脫、而華廠方面意在擯小、迭傳洋麥定成與洋麥抵埠消息、按粉廠所定之首批澳麥、爲時已隔月餘、核計已可到滬、但未確切證實、其餘之貨、在二三月份亦將湧到、且昨聞某廠又訂一船、定價爲二十五元六角之說、本年澳洲小麥佔計豐收、將有大量輸出、而近日洋商確實兜攬小麥甚殷、但國麥以目下粉市及環境關係、致買賣五擯、全市未有正式成交、陰曆年關已近、大局已在結束狀態中、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆交易微細</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧交易、雖不寂寞、但成交數量微細、市况在結束期中、無正式市面、大局因賣買互有參差、昨計杜豆沙黃豆由南洋幫辦去外、餘均爲囤戶胃口、共做開丁家州豆六百包（價詳市欄）、南京豆二車、蕪湖豆二百包、江北豆一車、平湖杜豆一百包、崇明沙黃一百五十三包、?石豆一百包、江北靑豆八十六包、管店雪蔴七十九包、平湖揀蠶九十包、奔牛赤豆五十餘包云、</p>
<p>又豆子二千四百八十包、及生仁五百包、今日運往香港、</p>
<h3>油市生豆油　衹囤戶搜進</h3>
<p>油市塲定今日全部結束手續、正市須待農曆新正初五日開紅盤、故豆油及花生油市况、昨已無甚變化、交易亦衹由本街採去大連原豆油十五桶、價爲一百元、及囤戶搜進膠州花生油一百件、價爲八十一元、又生油三百廳、今日運往香港、</p>
<h3>金融　華商活動　外匯轉緊</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、潛勢平靜、結果微緊、蓋受傍晚遍傳天津匯市改縮之影響、至全日經過初開均平、嗣因進口商結納、並華行與沙遜亦有吃胃、市勢即見帶軟、退達四辦士六五六二五、美滙七元七五、良以港電前來供塞、且加之斯時沙遜亦有套出現貨、故不久遂形回平、午刻買賣淸稀、爲狀即告呆滯、午後初以港電續塞、一度略現鬆動、美匯最賤外行吃過七元八四三七五、同時英金亦還過四辦士七〇三一二五、入後市上忽傳津地外匯猛縮、且因有利吃胃驟萌、是以引起少數華商活動、但外行供意淡薄、故迄收盤、衹告四辦士六五六二五及七元七五、結果英較美爲緊、計各軟〇三一二五、乃美英匯兌繼續相漲之故、期貨趨勢與現貨無別</p>
<p>沙遜出現貨進遠期</p>

<h3>強迫式的漲價</h3>
<p>— 劉導鴻</p>
<p>開年以來，物價不但未見抑低，反而步步高漲，大有無可或已之勢。今後的生活程度，將達到怎樣的最高峯，誰也不敢逆料吧！</p>
<p>漲價，自然有不得不漲的苦衷；這從各業漲價的啟事上，說什麼成本增高，爲維持血本計，不得不稍增售價，以資挹注云云，便可想見。經商應該獲利而不能虧本，是天經地議的事。因之，我們對各業正當的合理的張價，不敢有所訾議。</p>
<p>但，最近在報章上却看到幾個同業公會，爲了聯合漲價而警吿不漲價會員的啟事，皆謂有少數同業，故意抑低售價，殊屬影響其他同業，故對不照新價出售之同業，將予以制裁云云。</p>
<p>這實在令人不解。我們知道，商界中有句流行的俗話，叫做「本錢是師傳」，這吿訴我們商人是必不肯虧本的，我想，世上更沒有自己願意虧本的商人吧。尤其在今日的上海。那末同業公會所指的抑低售價的會員，我敢肯定的說，不過貪利之心較其他會員爲輕吧了，決不會自願虧本的。公會議決漲價而有少數會員不漲價，可見漲價還不是必要的事，不漲價還不致虧本。自然，漲價後的利潤較不漲價的利潤高得多！</p>
<p>可以不漲價而漲價，已屬大大非是；而公會竟還强迫貪心不大的會員也跟着漲價，並大言不慚的說什麼不增價將予以制裁，這還成什麼話！同業公會固然應該爲會員謀福利，但也不能不爲整個社會稍作打算。像這樣强迫會員漲價的公會，不過是被少數利慾薰心的無恥商人所操縱利用吧了！這樣所爲，不但有害此會，即在各同業自身，所得到的也不是眞正的福利。因爲，眞正的福利是光明的，正大的，却不是投機取巧所可得。</p>
<p>最後，我希望滬上各公會對這事有嚴正的表示。</p>
<h3>加了學費以後　一個家長的請求</h3>
<p>— 常方</p>
<p>我的一僩七歲孩子，在本弄弄堂小學里讀二年級，寒假報吿單送來的時候，另外附着一張油印的通吿書，是本校定於二月十日開學，二月二日交費；在交費下而有一張表格，一看二年級名下的學費是十二元，較這學期漲了二元，在備註項內又加了雜費一元，總共是十三元（書籍費在外）。</p>
<p>孩子書總要讀的，多加三塊錢一學期，在我這窮家長也「勉强」應付得了，但是一算日子，開學在廢曆正月初三，而學費却要年內交足，這倒有些躊躇，因爲我的收入名下沒有預算着要在年內付出這筆學費；曾想老老面皮去和校長商量，叨在本弄鄰舍，延至開學交款，然而正月初三也不是進款的日子，還是再「勉强」預備如期交款罷。</p>
<p>學費是加了（其他一般弄堂小學的情形大槪都如此）除了眞正」「勉强不起的家長外，我想代表我這樣尚屬「勉强」得起的家們向校長們有一點要求：</p>
<p>（一）敎書認眞一點，不要因爲敎員請假而叫學生們到弄堂里去打菱角，講講故事也好，叫學生在敎室內溫舊書或寫字都好；自然有其他敎員能代課最好。</p>
<p>（二）我不反對一星期有一二點鐘唱歌課，但是每大以唱歌來敷衍「課程表」是要不得的。</p>
<p>（三）每兩星期或一個月舉行一次考試，形式口試筆試不拘，免得孩子們「生呑活剝」，到了所謂「大考」的時候，不知抱那一隻佛脚才好。</p>
<p>我暫時舉出以上三點，這是就我孩子讀的學校所看到的缺點，其他的弄堂小學或許並不如此，但一般情形是大致相同的，總之，也請他們「勉强」放一點敎學精神出來。</p>
<p>最後，道或者是本弄小學的特殊情形，在每一課下課時，校內附設的商店，四門大開，那些糕餅之類頗引起孩子們的饞涎，於是他們跑回家來要「電四票」，這不但養成他們吃零食的壞習慣，同時分散了他們讀書的精神。希望諸如此類的「特殊情形」（弄堂小學的「特殊情形」是很多的），從本學期起有則改善，無則加勉。</p>
<h3>縫窮婦</h3>
<p>— 仲麟</p>
<p>這是一羣被社會遺忘了的人們，也是被任何有關婦女運動集團遺忘了的人們。然而她們的發展却在怒潮一般的繁榮滋長，同時也有着更甚於一般的悲慘的命運。</p>
<p>一個冬日的午後，寒風瑟瑟，已不是夾衣所能抵禦的了。這正是綢緞鋪子舉行所謂大减價的時候，也正是有錢人計劃添置冬季新裝的時候。由破行囊內翻一件薄棉袍　　　，我也從事寒冬的綢　了。</p>
<p>那一件棉袍子被老鼠咬了幾個洞，有些地方灰白的棉絮都露了出來。重做一件吧，沒有錢，於是不得不作成了江北縫窮婦的一筆生意。</p>
<p>她替我埋頭縫着，我靠了墻立在她身邊。馬路上汽車馳騁，行人來往，很顯示着活躍。我無聊的望望由我身邊走過的一批又一批着了大衣的女人，和正在替我補衣服的女人一此較，本能的會引起一種感觸來，於是我們有了以下一段的談話：</p>
<p>『你是什麼地方人啊？』</p>
<p>『江北，泰興的鄕下。』</p>
<p>『到上海幾年了？』</p>
<p>『唔，算算看，三十年也不止了。』</p>
<p>『一直幹這事嗎？』</p>
<p>『不，最初跟爸爸一道作工，之後嫁了人，有時候也做做工，再後死了丈夫，縫窮倒有十年了。』</p>
<p>『家裏還有人嗎？』</p>
<p>『七十多歲的婆婆，病得不能動了。十九歲的女兒在絲廠裏做工，一天五六毛錢要自管喫住。先生，你總曉得的：米，菜，房子，用的東西，那一樣不貴？一家三口肚皮混飽就是够勉强的事了。』</p>
<p>『那麼你一天能做多少錢哩？』</p>
<p>『那眞是可憐的，綫貴，針貴，做這事的又多，一天兩毛錢已是好生意了。』</p>
<p>『做這事的也很多嗎？』</p>
<p>『多得很！却沒有細算過，少說點一二千總有吧。少年時候可以進工廠，年紀慢慢大起來，工廠不要了，想活命就要想辦法，除了縫窮又有什麼辦法哩？近來格外多了，打仗以後關了許多廠，少年女人也走上這條路了，除了死掉一個才會少一個，不然是祗有朝上加的。』</p>
<p>『這也是一個嚴重的社會問題，那老的女工朝那裏走哩</p>
<p>『幸虧我們人口還少，三個倒有兩個掙錢，有幾個認識的人家，老老少少七八口，甚至就靠一個人縫窮的錢去養活，那簡直一天祗能喝一頓薄粥</p>
<p>『家鄕是回不去，沒有田種，而每年還陸續有來的，鄉下人把上海當做發財的地方，來了容易，想再回支却不可能了。』</p>
<p>她絮絮地講着，在我眼前彷彿就呈現了一幅圖畫：田地被毀了，扶老携幼跑上理想的路。結果是流浪，飢餓，死亡，毀滅！一切悲慘的詞句都加在她們的身上。當然她所說的一二千人實在上海是並不止此數的，沒有工做就走上縫窮的路，然而到不能縫補的時候，再朝那裏走哩？</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>邵慧華說：明天上午六點鐘，七點鐘，就有火車，學校裏九點鐘上課，正來得及，這話並不虛謊。上海到蘇州，快車不過二點鐘罷了。但吳君可說：「早車未免太局促，情願還是夜車去。夜車在上海，十一點鐘車，與十二點鐘車，都沒有關係。不過十二點鐘車，到蘇州是要一點鐘，未免太遲了一些。」一所以她決定」十一點鐘車，旣然澹雲姊的家裏，離西車站很近，就在西車站上車便了。這十一點鐘，十二點鐘，兩次火車，全是開往南京的。不過十一點鐘一趟車，沒有臥車。沿京滬路近來有好幾個市鎮都繁盛起來，沿路都要停車，有乘客上下，因此比較十二點鐘車，略慢了一些。十二點鐘車，幾乎全是臥車，只有三四節非臥車。這趟車，到了南京，還須過江，直走津浦路的軌道上去呢。過了深夜十二點鐘以後，上海開出去的客車暫停了，直要到明晨六點鐘再開。這其間，全是貨車的世界，因爲這京滬沿綫的貨物出產，也都有在京滬車上輸送的。那時她們六位小姐，便擠在一部汽車裏，開到金澹雲的家裏來。果然家裏也已有人在那裏招待，這是澹雲的幾位親戚長輩，已經從萬國大旅館回來了。知道定然有吃喜酒的人，要到家裏來，所以內外電燈通明，預備了許多糖果茶點款待佳賓。不過常六位小姐去的時候，其他的來賓，都沒有來咧，眞是邵慧華所說的捷足先登。可是不到十分鐘，來賓便續被而來。來賓中，尤其是女西賓，她們都要來瞻仰瞻仰中國人新婚的洞房，有什麼特異之點。其實林建成與金澹雲一對新夫婦，早已歐化了。便是他們的新房中，一切器具舖張，也全是四式。就是略有差異的，走進新房裏去，是一片紅光。譬如他們的地衣是深紅的，窗帘是澹紅的，瞻瓶中供着紅花，電燈上懸着紅珠，而尤其是牀上高高的疊着幾幅錦衾繡被，雖然五色紛披，而把一幅大紅繡着鴛鴦戲水的疊在上面。這都是金澹雲的一位姑母給她布置的，老太太們不無有些守舊，因爲中國的吉禮，一向是用紅色的，這與歐西的風俗，有些兩樣，歐西却以白色爲吉禮呀！　（三四）</p>

<p>四大名旦中之尚小雲，於民十三四年間，曾一度拜故名花旦田桂鳳爲師。後以師生二人，見解逈異，遂致背道而馳。然共所以然者，實由於田之窮，尚之傲有以致之也。先是尚於成名後，以己名在四大名旦中排列第三，心實不甘，因耳田名，擬拜之爲師。遂由共琴師趙四居間拉攏，訂定日期，於故都正陽門外同興堂舉行拜師禮。當趙四往田處道達來意後，以爲田處境困窘，常無不立即應諾，詎田竟含糊其詞。復經趙四再三追詢，田始答以容考慮數日，蓋田旣患貧，而其妻尤貪之甚。其所以不敢遽然應尤者，以未得其妻之同意。且以尚爲當代名伶，必須大大敲彼一次竹槓也。迨田與其妻商妥後，始往趙四處吿以己所提出之一切條件，其最要者，乃呈師贄敬之最低數，須四十元，每月薪水一百五十元。按月致送，不得拖欠。趙四遂即依從。於是訂定日期，齊集同興堂行拜師禮，至日，內外行前往觀禮者甚衆。尚即於大庭廣衆間，對田行一跪三叩禮，復由袖中取出一固封之紅封套，誠敬遞交，田欣然接受，後各盡歡而散。迨田返庽後，急拆封視之，不料封內僅置洋二元。田以尚之背信，實趙四之故。擬立即往趙處與之交涉。嗣經其妻勸止。蓋妻意以學生呈師勢　，僅於拜師時奉進一次，即損失亦有限度也。俟月終送束脩時，觀共是否照約，然後再定行止。及尚往田處請業，田於尚之不履行條件一事，一字不提，惟詢其欲學何劇。尚則請爲改正其戲鳳之做工，至「念」「唱」則由尚自出，無須田過問。而田以爲尚之戲鳳，旣經田改正，則全劇中「唱」「做」「念」，皆應隨田之改正者而演出之；故於尚之請求，堅決反對。隨即首爲改正劇中李鳳姐首次出塲所唱之四平調詞。尚聆之，頗不以爲然。緣今各名旦唱此者，悉用「人唇轍，」全段共六句，每句末一字，乃：「鎭」「陰」「云」「人」「定」「門」等字。田則與此完全不同，雖亦唱六句，但用「江洋轍。」詞爲：「自幼兒，生長在美龍鎭上，兄妹二人開店房。我哥哥，他曾對我講，他說道，前店有一位客商。將茶湯，放在桌案上，李鳳姐依舊回轉繡房。」尚謂田詞不通大路，（梨園術語，不普及之謂）竟置之不顧，仍大唱其「人辰轍」之唱詞。此爲田之無可奈何者一。嗣又授以鳳姐於第一塲下塲時之身段。普通旦角演至此，胥以雙手將巾高舉過頂。同時，以敏捷之舉動，迅速轉身面向正德，然後跑下塲去，田演此，則與上述者，絕不相同。乃先將巾騙取到手，隨即搭於右手腕上。然後對正德媽然一笑，再以小碎步跑入下塲門內。（田曾語余，是劇中之李鳳姐，非習閨門旦者扮演不可，以李鳳姐乃未出閨門之女子，自有其閨門女子之身份。豈能用今日旦角所常演之極似武生打飛脚之身段，以表其爲閨門女子哉？）尚以爲田之做工太溫，田雖爲之　解再三，終不獲要領而罷。此爲出之無可奈何者二。田旣處此情况下。仍竭力忍耐，蓋冀得一百五十元之薪水也。但師生感情旣發生裂痕，勢必不能處之久遠。果然，尚往田寓僅五次，即吿絕跡。初田以尚之不來，以爲其非患病，即爲事所覊絆。嗣經川探悉，尚於每日白畫在家吊嗓練功，晚則往東安市塲吉祥園登臺奏技。至是，田始知尚已決心背棄條件。乃於當晚赴吉祥園後臺，尋趙四交涉。田首訽其不履行條件之故。而趙四則左支右吾，無確實答覆。田以趙四之無誠，一至於此，遂義諷再三。趙亦反唇相譏。二人由口角而幾至動武。後經人調解，山尚一次贈田五十元，雙方，水斷葛藤。此田第一次收徒之結果也。此中內幕外間知者絕鮮，余則親聆之於田者。</p>
<h3>誤戲奇聞　（上）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>二簧班後台罰則，有臨時誤塲一條，雖不如軍律臨陣脫逃之嚴辦，亦罰包銀或罰祖師像前燒香以儆之。誤塲者，應上塲而不上塲也，臨時者，事前並未聲明原由，以致無人可替代也。本人在後台已扮好而誤者其過輕，本人不到後台而誤者其罪重，爲主角屆時不到者，名曰誤戲，其罪更大；比之軍律，爲大將者按兵不動，貽誤軍國，自應嚴懲矣。近二十年，伶人包銀大，身份高，好角如　毛麟角，天不常生，人不多見，後台優容好角，罰規遂浸漸崩潰，不可收拾。如唐之藩鎭，恣睢暴戾，尾大不掉，朝命不行，其積勢然也。</p>
<p>最善誤戲者，爲唱過覇王紅後之金少山，其誤戲也，每次必誤，好似家常便飯</p>
<p>吾今述吾親受南覇王誤戲之苦：民國十八年春，南京某校籌款義務戲，予爲提調，兼管後台，除的滬寗票友大會串外，有金少山諸角，予恐其誤戲也，早爲之備二汽車，一供其趕戲，一供人催戲，催之至再至三，彼仍不到，吾嘗親自飛車往催，幾欲肋生雙翅，心焦如火，見彼方短笛直吹，緩帶輕裘，鎭靜工夫，足稱無敵。然此時台上正墊小戲又馬後，（馬後爲術語，　（延時間之謂）台下看客，目蠢蠢騷動矣。稍有責任者，寗不急欲死耶？</p>
<p>影迷竟見</p>
<h3>二輪戲院的新節目討論</h3>
<p>— 王怡名</p>
<p>本市的四家　輸電影院實行「循環節目」以來，已經快近一年了。這個制度一般地說起來，是爲了節省覜衆的車錢，任何片子都可以等到鄰近的戲院去看。同時戲院方面的擔負也可以减少一點。不過在一般影迷說起來，四個個禮拜看來看去這幾張片子，實在不能過癮。</p>
<p>這次他們又更換了一批節目，這次的節目，有二點和以前不同的地：</p>
<p>（一）以前每次節目中，好片子都放在星期日開映。這次星期日的片子，除了「長相思」外都不能算特別精彩。反之，星期五六的影片倒都很不錯。這當然是爲了陰歷年初一，是星期四而不是星期日。關於這一點，希望四院當局在年初一那天，把星期五的影片提前公映一天，就是連映星期四五六三天。這樣才使觀衆在新年節目中，不受「循環節目」的限制，去看那不愛看的片子。</p>
<p>（二）這四家戲院，雖說繼承四大頭輪戲院的片子，可是米高梅片子的二輪總是屬於滬光的。（可是四院也演過，「賣花女」等一二張）。但是據說滬光自今年起專映國片，所以這次四院「循環節目」中，就有米高梅的「春滿西域」「草裙誘春」「巫山夢回」一張。說到這裏，想起米高梅許多佳片如「地老天荒」「孤兒樂園」「健美男兒」等，都因滬光時間不够分配未會映過，希望四院當局盡量地把這些影片排出來。</p>
<p>最後，希望四院選片方面，，憑一年的經騐，以後繼續排出使影迷更滿意的節目，並希望「錦繡山河」提早公映。</p>

<h3>Japan's Use of White Russians Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Tianjin: General Iimura, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, recently issued a statement to the White Russian Immigration Office in Harbin, stating that rumors that Japan and the Soviet Union are currently negotiating to increase friendly relations and that the Japanese army may therefore abandon its anti-communist international activities and no longer treat the White Russians in a favorable manner are completely untrue.

In addition, General Hata, leader of the Japanese military delegation, also hosted a banquet in Harbin for many White Russian leaders. He delivered a speech at the banquet, declaring that the Japanese army had no intention of changing its attitude towards the White Russians and that as long as the Japanese army existed, its policy towards the White Russians would not change. In their replies, the White Russian leaders explained the anti-communist international work they were carrying out. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Asama Maru Incident Deserves Close Attention</h3>
<p>Between England and Japan, the so-called Asama Maru Incident has now occurred. The Japanese government and public are clamoring to the point of hysteria, while the British authorities are prevaricating to the point of being at a loss for words. How it will unfold and how it will end in the future is bound to be complex and serious, and it will inevitably affect the internal affairs and diplomacy of both sides. It can be regarded as a touchstone. In terms of the case, the facts are extremely simple and the nature is extremely minor. In peacetime, not even first- or second-rate politicians or diplomats would bother to take it as an international issue. Moreover, today Japan is focusing solely on its invasion of China, and England is focusing solely on its war against Germany. Even reporters would consider such matters to be of little value. This would be the case in peacetime, let alone today, when history does not have time to discuss this. However, England and Japan are in turmoil, attracting attention far and wide, almost as if it were a major current event. Why?</p>
<p>It was ten days ago, on the 21st of this month at noon. The location was in the high seas off the coast of Chiba Prefecture, Japan, 35 nautical miles from the shore. The incident involved the Japanese merchant ship Asama Maru being intercepted and inspected by a British warship, and 21 German men of military age were taken away. The essence of the so-called Asama Maru Incident is indeed so simple and minor. Whether something is simple or not, minor or not, has no definition or standard. However, compared with Japan's bombing and strafing of the British ambassador to China by the Japanese Air Force without a declaration of war, the detention and imprisonment of British embassy military attachés, the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, and the infringement of British expatriate property in various places, and the frequent interception of British merchant ships by Japanese warships off the coast of Hong Kong, comparing all these, the interception of a neutral country's merchant ship by a warship of a belligerent country in the high seas and the detention of enemy country's men, as encountered by the Asama Maru, cannot be regarded as a simple and minor incident. England's explanations and justifications for this action are based on international law, international law, and international law. Japan's clamoring is based on a question of international law, England's "major unfriendly act" towards Japan, and damage to Japan's prestige, insult to the people of the Empire, provocation, contempt, serious national relations, deteriorating feelings, intolerable, unforgivable. Given the simple and minor nature of the incident, the reporter does not want to comment on its merits or demerits. However, given that England is so insistent and Japan is so outraged, even as the London dispatch reported yesterday, England is afraid that a written reply may provoke Japanese public opinion and does not dare to publicly announce the contents of the reply. Then, the so-called Asama Maru Incident today is not about its simple and minor nature, but about something else. It cannot be taken lightly!</p>
<p>How will it unfold? How will it end? It is impossible to foresee. "Well-informed sources in London say that there is still a possibility of it becoming serious!" Of course, this so-called seriousness will not lead England and Japan to fight over the 21 German men. Japan will not seize the Germans with its navy to express its wishes, nor will it arrest the British with its navy to retaliate. England will not send an ambassador, military attaché, or warship that has been insulted by Japan to Tokyo to question Japan. The degree of seriousness will not reach this point. A compromise is difficult to expect. Because England, during this war, considers anything that benefits the war and wins victory to be of the utmost importance. Therefore, it will not give up any of the belligerent rights recognized by international law. Even with America's kindness to England and England's high expectations of America, England has argued with America over issues that America feels uncomfortable with, such as inspecting mail to Germany and inspecting American ships' cargo, without worrying about whether it will damage America's prestige or feelings. Judging by this, can it be said that England regards Japan as a country that is more formidable and worthy of respect than America, and that it will break its precedent and abandon its international legal arguments, release the detained German men to accommodate Japan's clamoring about prestige and feelings? If so, England would be no different from declaring to the world that whoever roars and clamors at England can have England discard international law. England only fears Japan and the Japanese attitude, while it can ignore those who are tolerant like America. England should not be like this. However, with a fork in the road ahead, this can be a thorough test of England's founding spirit, England's policy towards Japan, England's policy towards the Far East, and even its policy towards everything else.</p>
<p>As for Japan: In terms of prestige, because it considers its own prestige to be supreme and unparalleled, it disregards the prestige of other countries, and often makes a fuss over trifles and likes to speak lightly of prestige. In terms of public opinion, it considers popular sentiment to be the easiest to control, and often stirs it up lightly, unaware of the danger being no different from playing with fire. Towards England, it is both respectful, loving, resentful, and hateful. Because of the difficulty of invading China, it is weak towards England inwardly, and fierce outwardly because of the opportunity of the European war. Towards Germany, it is not without heartache over being suddenly betrayed last autumn. However, in order to deal with England and maintain the appearance of its pro-German policy, it often deliberately shows people a light pity and deep love and infinite attachment when it comes to matters concerning Germans. All of this does not need much comment here. Does Japan not have enlightened people who know themselves very well, and do they need outsiders to remind them? However, the reason why the Asama Maru Incident has transcended its essence and formed today's tension and seriousness is also because these factors are important. Now that things have reached this point, the Tokyo authorities will certainly do their best for the country's zeal and loyalty and strive to negotiate. However, the success or failure of negotiations with England is not something that Japan can unilaterally decide. Moreover, the Germans detained by the British warship have been sent to Hong Kong, which Japan cannot force. Therefore, Japan cannot be said to have much glory in this case, and the bright future is really not something to be optimistic about. However, will the Japanese authorities recklessly disregard everything and take various direct and indirect actions to deal with the British and handle this case? Or will they rationally revise their clamoring and slightly restrain their high-pitched talk of prestige and feelings? Can it control the already released popular sentiment? Can it suppress the upcoming Diet? From popular sentiment to the Diet, can it accurately adhere to the scope of the case, discuss the matter on its merits, and not make excessive demands on the authorities? Or will it be dissatisfied with the authorities' important policies, and simply use this case as an excuse, taking advantage of the opportunity to express its views, not caring about causing a cabinet crisis and other more serious storms? The Asama Maru Incident is not only a touchstone of Japan's current domestic and foreign policy, but also a political reef in the sea.</p>

<p>London: Mr. Wyld, Director of the Americas Division of the British Ministry of Information, expressed his opinion in a speech in Hampton today, believing that the US relations with China may make it intervene in the European War, saying that the US policy is to prevent other countries from trying to seize China. Since the US holds this purpose, the US is paying more attention to the Sino-Japanese War than any other country except the Soviet Union today. This may be one of the reasons why the US is involved in the European War. Although the Sino-Japanese War is not directly related to the European War, its crux is not really unrelated to the European War. If this statement is not wrong, the US may see that its special interests in the Far East and its responsibility to Europe have a great influence. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark yesterday attended the House Naval Affairs Committee and requested Congress to approve the Navy Department's original proposal to increase the US fleet by 25 percent, because the proposal has a "deterrent effect" on aggressor countries.

<p>Washington: The US Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday approved a supplemental naval budget of $57,541,300, reportedly reducing the amount by $19,000,000. The reductions were mostly for warship armor, heavy guns, and bullets. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: It was learned here today that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a secret meeting tomorrow to discuss the imposition of an export embargo on Japan and economic assistance to Finland. At that time, Secretary of State Hull will issue a statement explaining the US attitude on the above two issues. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commented on US-Japan relations yesterday, declaring that "the decision to impose an export embargo on Japan will be shelved temporarily." Political figures pointed out that this is an effective way for the State Department to put pressure on Japan when it is conducting new talks. Political figures attach great importance to the above statement issued by Pittman because Pittman is the proposer of the bill to impose an embargo on Japan. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Congressman Tinker yesterday claimed that the policies of the US and Britain during the Sino-Japanese War are taking parallel actions, which is "an obvious fact." The US government is gradually and surely stepping forward to the European war. He accused the government of "replacing neutrality with political interference." The government "subsidized" the city-state in 1938 and supported Britain's war preparations against Germany with an "open and blatant" attitude. The government is advising the US to "adopt the same policy as Britain" in the Soviet-Finnish war. These actions are "senseless" and "destructive of neutrality" and constitute acts of war. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday advocated authorizing the President to implement an embargo on Japan, but most influential senators expressed opposition to this approach. Pittman believes that if the US wants the administration to continue to protest to Japan and wants this protest to be effective, it must authorize the President with full powers so that this protest will not become a useless piece of paper when necessary. However, according to Democratic Senator Wheeler, "I am unwilling to vote in favor of an export embargo on any country, because such measures only provoke resentment." Furthermore, imposing an export embargo on Japan is likely to involve the US in the Far Eastern war. I am consistently opposed to war, whether in the Far East or in Europe." New York Democratic Senator Wagner advocated that the issue of an embargo on Japan should not be rushed, but should be done gradually. As for Democratic Senator Nye, "I do not want to see our country interfere in others' affairs," and "I believe that the embargo approach will lead the US to war." (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet News Agency Article Discusses Japan's Economic Difficulties: Agriculture and Industry Severely Affected by War; Attempt to Resolve the "China Incident" Fails</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet News Agency (Izvestia) today published a commentary discussing Japan's economic difficulties. The report stated, "The Japanese ruling class attempted to resolve the 'China Incident' according to their own wishes, but so far, this attempt has failed. In the past few years, the Japanese army has not only failed to achieve a decisive victory, but has also suffered repeated crop failures this year. As the war continues to prolong, the economic difficulties of the Japanese Empire are becoming more serious. Recently, in addition to difficulties in raw materials, currency, and transportation, there is a severe food panic, especially the rice problem is the most acute. This national crisis fully proves the decline of Japanese agriculture. The impact of the war on Japanese agriculture is profound. The mobilization of Japanese men in rural areas has resulted in the loss of many excellent farmers. In addition, the lack of fertilizers and heavy taxation are also the main reasons for increasing the difficulties of Japanese farmers. As for the impact on Japanese industry, it is no less than that on agriculture. Due to the lack of raw materials, the scope of industrial work has been restricted. The Japanese army has occupied some territories of China for two and a half years. They must now realize that occupying Chinese land cannot solve the problem of Japan's raw material supply. Japan can only import a large number of raw materials from abroad." (January 29th, TASS report)</p>
<h3>Japan's Coal Shortage: Electricity Supply to Central Region Suspended</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The electric power company has decided to suspend the supply of electricity to various factories in the fourteen prefectures of central Japan from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM today. However, the electricity needed for munitions factories and public utility companies will still be supplied. The reasons for the power outage are: (1) coal shortage, (2) drought in the Osaka and Kobe areas, and (3) wind and snow hindering transportation and damaging power lines. The Japanese power company claims that if no new coal supplies are received today or tomorrow, then there will be a similar need to restrict power supply between January 31st and February 10th. Asahi Shimbun reported that central Japan's industry had previously suffered three large-scale power supply disruptions, causing some businesses to shut down completely, others to be destroyed, and most factories had to reduce their work by one-third. (January 30th, Reuters report)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It is learned that Mitsui &amp; Co. has purchased 50,000 tons of coal from a coal mining company in Calcutta, India. Mitsubishi &amp; Co. has purchased 50,000 tons of coal from a company in Vancouver, Canada. At the same time, the coal mining companies affiliated with Mitsui and Mitsubishi have promised Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiwara to supply 160,000 tons of coal next month for use by various power plants. Therefore, the shortage of electricity in Japan can be greatly alleviated. It is also learned that before this infusion, people in various parts of Japan have been striving to save on the consumption of electric lights and motor electricity. For example, a large department store in Osaka City stops operating all its elevators for one day every Thursday, and all goods counters are changed to use candles, because all shops, factories, or private individuals in the city that use more electricity have been ordered to save 66% of their usual electricity consumption.

<h3>German National Baker Commits Suicide in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The German national Baker committed suicide with a gun on the 25th due to a pessimistic idea caused after hearing of the death of the German industrialist Wulff. Baker's brief life story is as follows: Dr. Baker, named Paul, was born in Krefeld on February 26, 1883. His father was a businessman.

In 1927, he met the industrialist Wulff, and the two cooperated to establish an industrial company. Wulff appointed him as the company's chief representative in the Far East. Baker was ordered to come to China, which caused the company to have a very close relationship with the central government. The construction contracts for the Yushan to Nanchang, Nanchang to Yingxiang, and Xiang-Gui railways were finally concluded, and preparations were made to establish a Chinese automobile factory. In summary, Baker's work in recent years has been to strive to develop Sino-German business relations. Although there have been changes or setbacks along the way, he was still able to not slacken. (January 29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to an official announcement, the German national Baker here committed suicide on the 25th of this month due to being overwhelmed after receiving news of the death of his friend Wulff in Germany. Baker was born in Germany in 1893 and served in the army medical corps during the war. In 1927, he met Wulff and the two cooperated in operating industry. Baker then came to China as the Far East representative of the Wulff company, and signed a contract with the Chinese government to build the railway from Yushan via Nanchang, Pingxiang, Hengyang to Zuolin, connecting the four provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi. Before his suicide, Baker planned to organize a Chinese motor company. It is reported that Baker's body was found by a servant in his residence on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The Far East branch of the Wulff company published a notice of Baker's death in the English Hankou Chu Pao this morning, which stated, "Mr. Baker, private representative of Mr. Wulff and acting general manager of the Wulff Far East branch, passed away on the 24th of this month, and in accordance with his wishes, only his closest friends attended the funeral."

<h3>Explanation of the Scope of the National Monthly Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing - In order to explain the national monthly meeting and explain the scope of Chapter 5 of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, the National Spiritual Mobilization Association sent a telegram to the mobilization associations of various provinces and cities and the provincial and municipal party governments on the 26th of this month. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that in various places, when holding national monthly meetings, there are different opinions on Item 6 of the ceremony, which is to explain the outline of Chapter 5 of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and the National Covenant. Some believe that the explanation of the outline is limited to the outline of Chapter 5, while the outline and other chapters also need to be promoted and publicized, resulting in the feeling that the scope of explanation is too strict. According to the national monthly meeting ceremony, which is formulated in accordance with the general outline of the national monthly meeting, Chapter 5 of the outline is a specific regulation regarding our behavior, which is as important as the National Covenant. Therefore, it is specially opened as an explanation item. However, when explaining, it is important to inspire the audience's spiritual interest, and it is necessary to make a comprehensive and thorough explanation. Not only can the various chapters of the outline be explained, but also the entire legacy of the Prime Minister, the President's speeches, and the essentials of the New Life Movement can be cited in order to enrich the content of the lecture. The association is afraid that the national monthly meetings in various circles will be limited to the scope of explanation stipulated in the ceremony and cannot make a full explanation. Therefore, a detailed explanation is specially added so that there is something to follow. In addition to the separate telegram, a corresponding telegram is sent for reference and to instruct subordinates to inform everyone as necessary." (January 30th dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Premier's Broadcast Address: Strong Belief in Victory; The Lesson of Nazi Enslavement of Foreign Races is Not Far Away; Encouraging the People to Fight for Justice and Freedom</h3>
<p>Paris: Premier Daladier, in a radio address to the nation at 10 PM, first explained that National Socialist Germany has an overflowing "desire for control," unprecedented in history. "Because the control of National Socialism not only exerts power to force other countries to accept its will, but also painstakingly seeks to completely sweep away the conquered. Those who unfortunately fall under its rule, such as Austria, Bohemia, Slovakia, and Poland, are in utter darkness, and their people are in extreme hardship. For this reason, although each free nation guards its own territory and stands independently, there is another world outside these territories, which is being constructed with a clear distinction between master and slave, and where there is absolutely no freedom or equality in social life. This is the current situation of National Socialist Germany. The farmers and workers of Germany are slaves of the National Socialist masters, while the farmers and workers of Bohemia and Poland have fallen into slaves of slaves. Under these circumstances, France is confident of achieving victory and feels at peace, without any anxiety about the future, just like its ally, Britain. Indeed, the terror that pervades Europe has been stopped at our country's borders by our barbed wire and fortifications. Our youth are currently relying on these fortifications to fight calmly. The reason why the comprehensive war has not yet begun is because we have built this silent, strong barrier to curb the invasion of violence. I have expressed my respect to the soldiers at the front many times. Now, I want to pour out my heart to the people in the rear. It is important to know that at this time, the outbreak of a comprehensive war may not be delayed for long. The way to deal with it is to increase the manufacture of military supplies and develop land production. Many men can also set out to join the army, but because the rear also has needs, they are kept and not sent out. Those not needed in the rear have been sent to the front as much as possible by the government. Instances of evasion are being tried by military tribunals. In short, all the people of the country must make the most of their abilities, but those in the rear must also live the life of soldiers. All our brave soldiers at the front know that the current situation is extremely serious and difficult, so I ask the ordinary people to have the same feeling. Germany, seeing that our army's belief is strong, hopes that the will of our people may waver one day, thereby weakening us and hastening our downfall. The enemy initially thought that it could use the swastika flag to command its lackeys and use the red hammer flag to lure our country's workers, hoping to incite French people to fight among themselves. But after the German army invaded Poland last September, the mask was immediately torn off, and the two flags merged into one, becoming the flag of barbarians plundering wealth and enslaving men. The government that I preside over has already cracked down on foreign workers and will continue to do so in the future without any leniency. But this is not revenge, nor is it judging based on political prejudice. It is because the current government is the government of the French nation, and it punishes the leaders of the Communist Party simply because these people continue to obey Moscow and are driven by Berlin. But at the same time, the government is willing to extend a friendly hand to those who previously joined the Communist Party but have now recovered the true traditional spirit of French workers. Their initial joining of the Communist Party was to wish for a union between France and the Soviet Union to maintain peace, which was a legitimate act, no different from the legitimate act of some people previously wishing to be close to Germany. However, in the current situation, if French people still obey Berlin or Moscow, it constitutes a crime. What we are punishing now is this kind of crime, and we will punish it severely, without any compassion. Since the German propaganda machine has failed to incite French people to fight among themselves, it is now trying to alienate Britain and France and sometimes seeking to destroy France's determination and belief. This is what German technicians call "whispering propaganda." To the rich, they say, "Your property is not guaranteed." To the workers, they say, "This war is a war incited by the rich." To the intellectual class and artists, they say, "What you love is in danger of being destroyed." To those who usually enjoy luxury, they say, "In a few months, your life will have to be greatly curtailed." To those who believe in religion, they say, "Can such slaughter be accepted by doctrine?" To the vagrants, they say, "You can take advantage of the national disaster to make a profit." There are many such claims, but some people, with no other intentions, are mistakenly propagating them or even being used by their money. In fact, those who make this propaganda are the people who plunder wealth, enslave the working class, eliminate intellectual freedom, cause millions of lives to suffer terrible hardships, and use massacre as a code of governance. In summary, Germany's plot has failed and can be said to have suffered a setback in spirit, but its material strength is still one of the strongest in the world. Fortunately, our country's people are diligent in operating and abide by discipline, and we will surely win victory in this terrible war. This war not only threatens the survival of various countries but also threatens the fundamental ideas of human existence. At a time when the authorities in Berlin are mentally deranged and are about to create a world of master-slave divisions, we should not shirk our responsibility and should take saving freedom and human dignity as our task."

Helsinki issued air raid alerts four times yesterday, but the incoming Soviet planes were all driven away by anti-aircraft fire and did not drop bombs. Finnish planes also bombed Soviet troops and their concentration points. According to reports from the industrial center of Åbo, the city was repeatedly attacked yesterday, with 20 people killed and 50 injured. When 50 Soviet bombers came to attack, they stopped their engines, descended silently, and dropped bombs, destroying more than 20 houses. The attack on Åbo yesterday was the most severe. From 9:45 AM to nearly 4 PM, the bombing continued. Mr. Gan You, British intelligence attaché stationed in Helsinki, and Mr. Zhai Xuelanste, British vice-consul stationed in Åbo, are both in Åbo and are reported to be unharmed. Åbo has been bombed 35 times in the past eight weeks. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Finnish Front: Yesterday, Soviet planes bombed Åbo, resulting in 30 deaths and 50 injuries. It is said that yesterday's bombing was the most intense air raid since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war. Soviet planes dropped incendiary bombs, causing fires in many places. Soviet planes also hit a military Red Cross hospital, resulting in 19 soldiers being killed and 4 women also dying. After the bombing, reporters immediately went to inspect the site and witnessed the fire still burning fiercely, with the flames illuminating the entire city. Bloodstains remained in the white snow, and their bright red color reminded people of the tragic deaths of the victims. It was heard that the rescue team had tried their best to rescue, but failed to rescue the people in the hospital. It is said that Soviet planes flew low and strafed the mourners with machine guns. (Special dispatch from United Press correspondent Miller, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to the communiqué of the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, there were no major developments on the front on the 29th, but the Soviet Air Force carried out bombing activities and reconnaissance flights and shot down seven enemy planes in various places.

<h3>Soviet Icebreaker "Sydov" Returns Home, Celebrations in Murmansk</h3>
<p>Moscow: The flagship of the Soviet Arctic Fleet, "Stalin," and the icebreaker "Sydov," after being rescued, arrived in the port of Murmansk yesterday. The crew of the "Sydov" drifted on the Arctic ice for 812 days. Today they returned safely and were warmly welcomed.

<h3>Britain and France Amass Troops in the Near East, Preparing for Future Events; Syria Resembles a Military Camp; Preventing the Advance of Soviet and German Forces</h3>
<p>Paris: As far as people here know, France has stationed a large army in the Near East to prevent any possible German invasion in the Balkans. Although the exact number of troops stationed has not been revealed, semi-official sources claim that the Allied forces will station sufficient troops in the Near East to cope with any changes. The purpose is to fulfill the obligations to Turkey, Greece, and Romania, and the responsibility to Yugoslavia's friendship. It is heard that France has formed an army in Syria, commanded by former Chief of Staff General Weygand. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: "Swizda," the organ of the Soviet Red Army, today published an essay by a military expert, reviewing the military and strategic position of the Near East. It said that Britain and France are carrying out far-reaching military and strategic plans in the Near East. The current military preparations and diplomatic activities are common proof. Syria has almost become a military camp, with troops of various colors concentrated, and military supplies and food are stored everywhere. General Weygand is a French strategist and can be sent as commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Near East at any time. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Under the Watchful Eyes, Romania is Surrounded by Crises; The Great Powers Covet Natural Resources and Become a Field of Economic Competition</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Recently, the situation in which Romania is located has become increasingly tense. Whether in military, economic, or diplomatic terms, it has become a place for European powers to compete. It is not without reason that it makes people uneasy. In military terms, news about the movement of German and Soviet troops near the Romanian border has been rife. To the north, the entry of German troops into the Galician province of Poland is not only credible, but also shows signs of increasing. Although the German side said that this is to supervise the withdrawal of German residents in the Soviet-occupied area, in reality, it is at least sufficient to control the freight transport from Romania to Germany. It is reasonable for the people in the border area of Romania to feel uneasy about this. To the east, the management of the Soviet railways has become increasingly poor due to frequent military transport. Because the Red Army troops who entered Poland in September last year have become tired, incidents of soldiers escaping or disobeying orders are small and numerous. Therefore, the Soviet authorities urgently need to transfer troops to relieve them. According to travelers from the Soviet port of Kiev, a large number of Red Army troops were seen concentrated in the area where the Soviet Union and Romania meet, that is, the Dniester River area. This is also sufficient to arouse the suspicion of the Romanian people. In economic terms, since the outbreak of the European War, Romania has been constantly subjected to pressure from Germany and has become an "economic battlefield" for various countries to compete. According to the recently concluded German-Romanian commercial agreement, Germany can obtain 130,000 tons of kerosene from Romania every month, but due to transportation inconveniences, this provision is actually equivalent to a mere document. To sum up, the amount of Romanian kerosene shipped to Germany this month is less than 20,000 tons. In addition, Britain has recently purchased twice as much kerosene and grain from Romania as before the war. At the same time, Italy has also become a competitor of Germany, and the amount of Romanian kerosene it purchases has obviously increased day by day. This "kerosene war" is in full swing, and it is expected that Germany will definitely intensify its pressure on Romania. There is no doubt about it. In Romania, on the one hand, it is eager to maintain neutrality, and on the other hand, it wants to fulfill the contracts it has established with its patrons while maintaining its political and economic independent sovereignty. However, Germany and the Soviet Union are close at hand, while Britain and France are thousands of kilometers away. How can each country feel equally satisfied? This question is really difficult to solve. As for the political aspect, although the Permanent Political Conference of the Balkan Consultation is about to be held, since the countries involved in the consultation each adhere to their positions, it may not be possible to promote major changes through this conference. Therefore, Romania has little hope for this. In short, how Romania can turn danger into safety in the future still depends on its own efforts. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Germany Intensifies Pressure on Romania; Appointing a Trade Administrator to Vigorously Promote Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Bucharest: According to news from this question, Germany has appointed the Mayor of Vienna, Neubach, as the trade administrator for German-Romanian relations, intending to make renewed efforts to participate in Romanian industries. Romania has consistently resisted the implementation of part of the commercial agreement signed in March 1939, namely the plan to establish a German-Romanian mixed company to develop Romanian oil mines, timber, and other resources. It is expected that Mr. New will exert pressure to promote its realization. If Romania makes concessions, the export of goods may be transported to Germany from Romanian trucks. It is heard that in order to win Romania's favor, Germany is now proposing to oppose Hungary's claim to Outer Transylvania and will use its power to prevent the Soviet Union's intimidation of Bessarabia.

<h3>German Troops Enter Soviet-Occupied Polish Territory</h3>
<p>City of Cernauti, Romania: Although Germany and the Soviet Union have both denied that German troops have entered the eastern part of the Galician province of Poland, which is the Soviet-occupied area, informed sources from this question still say that this statement is indeed reliable, and there are four pieces of evidence: (1) Several trains have been seen in the Galician province, carrying German army officers and soldiers in green uniforms, heading east or towards the Hungarian border; (2) German officers and soldiers in uniform have also been seen in many places in the Galician province, especially in the Changfang and George Hotels in the city of Lviv; (3) Some highways and railways in the province have been closed to the public at certain times, but German military transport has never been interrupted; (4) Although it is impossible to determine whether a large number of German troops have crossed the border from the German-occupied area into the Soviet-occupied area recently, it is absolutely reliable that some German National Socialist Party members, disguised as technicians, teachers, or members of other paramilitary groups, reside in places that were previously occupied by the Soviet army. In addition, according to observers, the number of Soviet border guards in the Galician province and the Romanian-Hungarian border areas has recently increased significantly, but the Red Army troops in some cities in the province have been transferred elsewhere, and the local militias have also been disarmed. Regarding this matter, a Soviet official spokesman explained that "after the enemies of the Polish people created disturbances everywhere, the militias came out to suppress them, often being too severe. For example, one day in the city of Zibaras, some rioters attempted to incite a civil unrest, and 40 people were shot on the spot by the militias. In order to be cautious, the authorities disarmed the Republic." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Japan Visited Arita Yesterday; No Agreement Yet Reached on the Border Demarcation Between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Mr. Smidny, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, went to the Foreign Ministry at 1:35 PM today to visit Foreign Minister Arita and discussed various outstanding issues. He left at 2:35 PM. (Domei dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to news from Japan, the Joint Committee on the Border Demarcation Between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia has been meeting in Harbin for a long time and has achieved some results, but no formal agreement has yet been reached. It is not known whether the meeting will continue. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Craigie and Arita Hold Second Meeting; Negotiating on the Asama Maru Case; Japan Firmly Insists on the Release of the Arrested Germans</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The British government's reply regarding the "Asama Maru" incident arrived this afternoon. Ambassador Craigie immediately requested a meeting with Foreign Minister Arita and held the second Arita-Craigie meeting at the Foreign Minister's official residence from 4 PM, continuing the negotiations that took place at the first meeting held on the 27th of this month. (Domei dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Director of the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry issued a statement at 7:30 PM as follows:</p>
<p>The meeting between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita on January 30 was held from 4 PM to 6:30 PM at the Foreign Minister's official residence to discuss the Asama Maru issue. During the meeting, Foreign Minister Arita consistently insisted on the release of the 21 arrested Germans. It has been decided to continue the discussion the next day. Therefore, the British document handed over by the British Ambassador on the 27th could not be released immediately. On the other hand, Japan's reply is imminent. (Domei dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo telegram, according to Asahi Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun, the Japanese government is preparing to reply to the British reply on the 27th regarding the Asama Maru incident, which will be submitted within a day or two. Asahi Shimbun said that the British reply only discusses legal issues, without considering political issues. It has neither given a guarantee for the future nor returned the arrested Germans. In the reply that Japan is about to submit, it will also explain Japan's views on legal issues. (Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Kokumin Shimbun said that the British reply to Japan's protest regarding the "Asama Maru" case was not as moderate in its wording as expected. Foreign Minister Arita is concerned that if there is no action, the government will face a major attack when the Diet reopens on Thursday. Therefore, he will visit British Ambassador Craigie today and point out the inappropriateness of the British side's reasons. It seems that the Foreign Minister's opinion is not entirely in line with public opinion. Public opinion advocates that Britain should (1) return the arrested Germans, (2) guarantee that the same incident will not happen in the future, and (3) formally apologize. Asahi Shimbun said that the British side's unilateral stance on international law in the "Asama Maru" case cannot be established. The British side is using its unilateral opinions to make unnecessary statements in an attempt to evade responsibility. This attempt is not suitable for the plan to enhance British-Japanese friendship. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the Asama Maru incident, the reply from the British side to the Japanese government is only a draft. The official reply will be delivered to the Japanese side after the British-Japanese talks in Tokyo are concluded. Officials here refused to comment on the Japanese side's request to return the 21 German personnel, but they do not believe that there is a possibility of the Germans being handed over to the Japanese side. It is believed here that the British side's action is based on international law. If the British side releases the Germans in response to the Japanese side's request, then this example will be set, and many Germans with military relations will also be sent back to their country. It is hoped here that the Tokyo talks will result in a peaceful resolution of the "Asama Maru" incident, on the one hand, without losing Japan's face, and at the same time, without hindering the British side's rights.

<h3>Guangdong Province, East River: Chinese Troops Continuously Sweep Forward, Fierce Battles in All Important Towns, Chinese Troops Have Entered a Stage of Stability</h3>
<p>Shaoguan Correspondence: The Chinese troops on the eastern route of Guangdong Province have been sweeping through Longmen and advancing towards Zengcheng in recent days, making smooth progress. The Japanese troops within Longmen have mostly fled in disarray. The Chinese troops on the Zengcheng-Conghua line have also repeatedly reported victories. Overall, the war situation in the East River has entered an extremely stable phase.</p>
<p>The Chinese troops on the eastern route, descending from Longmen, have reached Yonghankou. The remaining Japanese troops, numbering several thousand, are at their last gasp. After a fierce two-day attack by the Lin Division of the Chinese army, their front lines wavered, and they fled to Zhengguo and Xintian in Zengcheng County. By the 11th, Yonghan had been completely recovered by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 12th, the Huang Regiment of the Lin Division of the Chinese army attacked Xintian, at the border of Zengcheng and Longmen. More than 800 Japanese troops still attempted to resist. After four or five hours of fighting, the remnants retreated to Zhengguo Market under the cover of Japanese aircraft. The Chinese army is intensifying its encirclement and annihilation. At Piling, near Mazha, several hundred Japanese troops attempted to prevent the Chinese army from advancing on Zhengguo but were also repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese troops, advancing on the Zengcheng-Conghua line from Paitan, have been besieging Gonghe Market northwest of Zengcheng for days, successively occupying strongholds in nearby Yuechang, Dengzhegu, and other places. The Japanese troops, within the Chinese army's encirclement, are still trying to hold on to the death. After a day and night of fierce fighting, a unit of the Liu Regiment of the Chinese army stormed Gonghe Market at noon on the 10th, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops. The fighting was fierce, and the Japanese corpses were piled up, and they retreated to one corner. The Chinese army, while encircling and annihilating the remaining Japanese troops, also sent teams to attack along the line of Lapu and Liangtian, cutting off Japanese reinforcements from Zengcheng and Fuhe. Furthermore, after the Japanese troops in the Miaotan and Xiaolou areas north of Zengcheng retreated back to Zengcheng, units of the Chinese army have been active in Hecen, Zhuguling, Caocun, and other places, attacking the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops are exhausted from running around.</p>
<p>Another report: After the Japanese troops retreated from Yonghan, Shajing, and other places on the border between Longmen and Zengcheng counties, the Chinese army continued to launch a fierce counterattack on Zengcheng, recovering Baishidong. Fierce contact with the Japanese troops occurred near Zhengguo. On the 13th and 14th, the fighting remained intense. The Japanese army dispatched more than 200 soldiers and two copper cannons from Zengcheng to Zhengguo, attempting to hold on. On the afternoon of the 13th, another route of the Chinese army continued to launch a counterattack towards Paitan, threatening the connection between the Japanese troops on the Zengcheng-Conghua line. On the morning of the 14th, fierce battles broke out between the two sides. The Chinese army also charged the Japanese positions at noon, launching a fierce battle.</p>
<p>On the Conghua front, after the Japanese troops in Liang Kou and Jiekou were successively repelled by the Chinese army, their main force has withdrawn to the area between Shagang and Taipingchang, returning to the state of a month ago. According to military news from the front at noon on the 14th, Xiaotang and Jindong were successively recovered by the Chinese army on the 13th and 14th. The Japanese troops retreated towards Xiangshan Market and Shagang. The frontal Chinese army attacked Yungang Market (near Shagang) on the morning of the 14th and is currently engaged in a fierce battle. Regarding the battle on the Shilong front, according to military news from the front, it is still very intense. After the Chinese army launched an attack on Shangxia Nan, the outer perimeter of Shilong, on the 12th, the Japanese army immediately dispatched 500 infantry and cavalry from the Shitang area to reinforce the defense in Xia Nan, Nan Jing and Lushan. That evening, the Chinese army again launched a surprise attack on Lushan at night, and another unit attacked Xia Nan again. The Japanese troops in both places, because their strength had slightly increased, were quite stubborn, using searchlights to search for targets and densely firing to defend. However, after about two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army finally broke through the Japanese positions in Lushan, annihilating several hundred soldiers. As for the Japanese troops in Xia Nan, 70 to 80 soldiers were also killed. Until the morning of the 13th, fierce battles continued between the two sides.</p>
<p>As for the southern bank of the East River, it is reported that the Eighth Regiment of the Chinese Army Security Forces, led by Zhang Yu, launched a two-pronged surprise attack on Shangxia Nan and other places at dawn on the 12th. This area is the outer defense of Shilong and is guarded by 500 to 600 Japanese troops from Lang Qingtian's unit, a considerable force. They were caught by surprise and resisted from bunkers. The Chinese army used heavy machine gun fire as cover, and with one burst of courage, broke through their positions, violently charging with broadswords and grenades. The situation was extremely intense. Gunfire was also heard in the Hengli area. Around 10 o'clock, the Japanese troops in Shilong dispatched several hundred infantry and cavalry in two routes to rescue. One route consisted of more than 100 infantry in eight motorboats, sailing up the East River. The other route consisted of more than 200 soldiers, coming from Lushan, flanking the side of Xia Nan, attempting to attack from the rear. However, the Chinese army was prepared. The route attempting rescue via the East River was intercepted at Liaokou. The route coming from Lushan was also repelled by the Chinese army. From dawn to 5 p.m., there were 11 hours of bloody battle, with frequent hand-to-hand combat. At approximately 5 o'clock, the Chinese army withdrew to its original position after completing its mission, still tightly holding the southern bank. Japanese planes launched a large-scale attack. On that day, the Japanese troops, caught by surprise by the Chinese army's attack, dispatched three seaplanes from Japanese warships overseas around 11 o'clock, in addition to sending reinforcements in different directions. These seaplanes flew to provide cover for the operation, dropping ten bombs on the Chinese positions, circling at low altitude, firing guns. This lasted for more than an hour, but the Chinese army was well-sheltered and suffered no losses. After dropping their bombs, the three Japanese planes continued to fly along the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway line, harassing Hengli, Chashan, Nanshe, Masi, Longjiao, Qishi and other places along the East River, and spraying machine-gun fire along the way. They finally left around 2 p.m.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Flies to Zhejiang to Plan Counteroffensive, Japanese Troops in Yu Shan and Zhe Shan are Surrounded by Chinese Troops Awaiting Annihilation</h3>
<p>Shaoxing Correspondence: At approximately 12 p.m. on the 21st, more than 2,000 Japanese troops on the north bank of the Qiantang River, divided into more than 100 motorboats, forcibly crossed the Qiantang River under cover of artillery fire. The Chinese troops and security forces there immediately fought back bravely, launching a fierce and bloody battle. The next morning, as the Japanese troops were in a precarious situation, a large squadron of Japanese aircraft suddenly flew from Jianqiao, Hangzhou, dropping light and heavy bombs over the Chinese army positions and strafing with machine guns. At this time, the Chinese troops still braved the dangers, resisting fiercely. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side's fresh troops crossed the river to join the battle, and even released poison gas. The Chinese troops were forced to change their positions, and Tou Peng, Fuqingbu, Cangqianzhen, Guishan, and other places fell one after another. After occupying Guishan and other places, the Japanese troops not only set fire to civilian houses everywhere, but also massacred innocent Chinese people. On the 22nd, the Japanese troops advanced in two routes, one along the railway towards Ningbo, and the other along the highway to Shaoxing. On the 23rd, Xiaoshan was occupied again. The vanguard of the Japanese army, the Akita Unit, not only robbed and burned inside and outside the city, but also invaded southwards. On the 24th, the Japanese troops arrived directly at Qianqing Town. The Chinese troops engaged the Japanese troops in hand-to-hand combat near the town all day, killing many. Later, due to orders to withdraw, the Japanese troops occupied Anchang. The Japanese troops even advanced to Heqiao, near Shaoxing, on the 25th. Senior Chinese generals, Army Commander Liu Jianxu and Huang Shaohong of the X Group Army, personally went to the front line to supervise the battle, and used surprise troops to attack the rear of the Japanese army, and then recovered Wenjiayan, Yiqiao, and Linpu. The Japanese troops in Bailutang have also been wiped out. Most of the Japanese troops have fled to Guishan, Zeshan, and other places. The Chinese army has now surrounded these places, so the Japanese troops there are being annihilated.</p>
<p>Gu Zhutong, commander of the X War Zone, flew from XX to a certain place in eastern Zhejiang on the 24th, and immediately went to the front line with Huang Shaohong to inspect, and gave a speech to the officers, encouraging them to fight bravely. Then, he convened a special meeting of military officers to discuss the counter-offensive plan. After the meeting, Xuan Tiewu rushed to the XX front line overnight to supervise the battle, so the fighting in the Guishan area is now extremely fierce.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Puppet Troops' Internal Strife, Song Jiaozhong Defects and is Arrested</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: There are many factions in the puppet army in Wuxi, internal strife occurs from time to time, and there is no shortage of defectors. Recently, there was Song Jiaozhong, formerly under Cheng Wanjun in Wujiang. After Cheng surrendered, Song was very unwilling. He secretly conspired with Tian Wenlong and others to overthrow Cheng, but failed. He then went to Yi Guobiao's place to persuade the soldiers of the puppet army to defect. Ninety soldiers, with eighty to ninety rifles and machine guns, agreed. He secretly coordinated with the puppet regime, obtaining the name of the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army," and secretly assigned to the puppet pacification team to correct the erroneous thinking of the puppet soldiers. The day before yesterday, he was suddenly arrested by Cheng Wanjun, commander of the puppet pacification force, and secretly interrogated at the puppet headquarters in Zhoushanbang. Song knew that he and Cheng had worked together in Taihu before, and that there was a secret language among the brothers in the gang, which was the jargon of the same gang. Song immediately said to Cheng, "I have long heard of your benevolence extending to the four seas, and your righteousness as heavy as the mountains, thousands of layers of blessing, tens of thousands of layers of blessing, clouds rising from Mount Emei, covering the sky and the earth, like Yao and Shun before, and like Kong Ming after, benevolence like Liu Bei, righteousness like Song Jiang, brother is rude, I am under your care and protection, I greet and thank you, I hope that you will forgive me." Cheng, knowing that this was a solemn greeting in the Red Gang's secret language, pretended not to know and rebuked Song for being crazy and having a mental illness. He first ordered him to be beaten with fifty military clubs, beating Song until his skin was torn and his flesh was bruised, and then he imprisoned Song, fearing for his life.</p>
<h3>Central Government Issues Clear Order Commending Chen Yangguang and Others for Donating Funds for Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 30th) The National Government issued an order on the 30th: The Executive Yuan presented a report from the Ministry of Education, stating that Chen Yangguang and Yu Shuhuai had donated more than 30,000 yuan for education in the 28th year of the Republic of China, which is in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Regulations on Commendation for Donating Funds for Education. In addition to awarding them a first-class certificate by the Ministry, the case was compiled and submitted to the Mingling for commendation. Chen Yangguang and Yu Shuhuai generously donated funds and were enthusiastic about education. They should be commended by Mingling as an encouragement. This order,</p>
<h3>The Rejuvenating Education of Western Zhejiang (II)</h3>
<p>This semester, there are a total of 747 students in the First Middle School, three grades of junior high school, and one grade of senior high school, all co-educational. There are 450 students in the Second Middle School, which only has junior high school and does not accept female students. The Third Middle School also only has junior high school, but accepts female students and has a total of more than 270 students. None of the three middle schools charge tuition fees. Boarding and miscellaneous fees are 43 yuan per semester for senior high school and 40 yuan for junior high school. However, students from the occupied counties or the families of students from the war zone counties who are poor can apply for relief. There are four types of relief: A, B, C, and D. Type A relief can provide 86 yuan per year, Type B can provide 68 yuan per year, Type C can provide 40 yuan, and Type D can provide 27 yuan. In total, among the more than 1,400 students in the three schools, relief students account for about 45%. Among all the relief students, those receiving Type A relief account for about 60%. In terms of the place of origin of the relief students, the most are from Changxing, Fuyang, Xiaofeng, Anji, Hangzhou City, Pinghu, and Yuhang counties.</p>
<p>The establishment of wartime middle schools in western Zhejiang, in addition to providing relief to out-of-school youths in the occupied areas and war zones, has significant political significance. Youths from the occupied areas continue to come to the rear to study, making it impossible to implement enslavement education. On the other hand, the general students receive state relief and focus on their studies, so that their parents, although unfortunately living in the occupied areas, still have infinite nostalgia for their motherland. Therefore, the people of the entire occupied area are determined to believe that the war of resistance will surely be victorious. However, there are so many students from the occupied areas and war zones that the three middle schools are not enough to accommodate them. Moreover, students travel long distances, risking crossing the Japanese lines of defense, and often cannot come to take the exams. Their level, age, and proof documents often do not meet the requirements, which makes the school authorities very difficult. Now, the Zhejiang West Administrative Office is preparing to set up a youth reception center to recruit youths from the war zone, provide some training, and then introduce them to occupations or send them to training schools. The Provincial Department of Education is also preparing to add Wuxing Middle School and Jiaxing Middle School, and will also establish a normal school in Western Zhejiang, which can not only provide relief to out-of-school youths, but also train primary school teachers, which is a win-win situation. It is hoped that this can be realized as soon as possible. As for the method of recruiting young people, Hangzhou County is the best. After receiving the enrollment notices from the three middle schools in western Zhejiang every semester, the county party and government authorities immediately send people to the occupied areas to publicize and recruit out-of-school youths, gather them in one place, and send them to the exam site under the escort of the government. After the exam, those who cannot be admitted are introduced or sent to other places for training or work with the consent of the students' parents. If they are willing to go home, they are also escorted home by the original person, comforted and encouraged to take the exam again next time. All expenses for food, lodging, and supplies required for the exam are fully borne by the government. If this can be done, the school authorities can save a lot of difficulties, and the students can also get various conveniences. It is hoped that the authorities in all counties can follow this method to fully achieve the task of rescuing young people.</p>
<p>In secondary education in Western Zhejiang, there is one thing worth mentioning in particular, that is, the Trinity Society Supplementary Middle School founded by Mr. John Hall, the American host of the Trinity Society in Wuxing. Mr. John Hall has been in charge of the Trinity Society in Wuxing for more than 40 years. Before the war, the Trinity Society had a supplementary middle school, which was highly praised by the community. When Wuxing was occupied, Mr. Hall moved to Mogan Mountain, and soon returned there to restore various undertakings of the Trinity Society, the most important of which was the restoration of the Trinity Society Supplementary Middle School and affiliated primary school. In the past two years, the number of primary and middle school students has increased to more than 1,000, while the middle schools established by the Japanese puppets are sparsely populated, with very few students. Moreover, the textbooks used by the Trinity Society's primary and middle schools are all business Chinese textbooks that Mr. John Hall personally purchased in Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese hate him to the bone, and have repeatedly sent troops to search and disrupt, but all have been sternly rejected by Mr. Hall, and he has personally gone to the Japanese Kenpeitai to negotiate. Once, the commander of the Japanese Kenpeitai asked him, "When will you stop running this school?" He replied very well, he said, "Whenever you leave, I will stop running it. As long as the Japanese are in Huzhou, I will run it for a day." That commander of the Kenpeitai had no choice. Mr. Hall often told students the reasons for the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance at the morning meeting in the school every day. Recently, I saw the document he submitted to the Provincial Department of Education requesting approval for registration, in which the student roster, the resumes of teachers and staff, the version of the textbooks, and various photos and atlases were extremely detailed. However, since the school is located in the occupied area and cannot be reached by the laws and regulations and supervision of the Chinese government, it is probably impossible to grant it registration. However, it is hoped that the Department of Education can modify the method and provide more spiritual encouragement to thank this respectable foreign friend.</p>

<h3>Japan Intensifies Monopoly of Shipping with Portuguese Vessels at Various Ports, Forming Sino-Portuguese Shipping Company, Manager is Japanese and Controls Everything</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Japan's monopoly of shipping along the Chinese coast and rivers will take another step forward within two weeks. In September, twelve Portuguese ships detained by the Japanese Navy on the waters of this city will be incorporated into the Japanese-controlled Sino-Portuguese Shipping Company. These ships, registered in Portugal, are all wooden, mostly built ten to twenty years ago, and rarely exceed 300 tons in deadweight. Previously, they operated between the mouth of the Yangtze River and</p>
<p>nearby coastal ports with considerable success. Now that the Sino-Portuguese Shipping Company is about to be established, the director is Yamanaka, the manager of the East Asia Shipping Company, and the deputy director is Portuguese. However, the ships will retain their Portuguese registration to avoid hurting national sentiments. The ships are now docked between Pudong and Wusong. Five of them were initially detained by the Japanese Navy for</p>
<p>allegedly smuggling goods and military supplies to the guerrillas around Shanghai. The Japanese Navy then detained the remaining ships on the pretext of "investigating their identities." Since last summer, the Portuguese Consulate has been negotiating with the Japanese Naval authorities for the release of the ships, but without success due to disagreements on terms. In November of last year, the Portuguese finally conceded and agreed to establish the Sino-Portuguese Shipping Company, with the power in the hands of Tanaka, appointed by the Japanese Naval authorities.</p>
<p>When the Portuguese and Japanese sides negotiated, the shipping companies of third countries felt uneasy. In this city, apart from the ships of the British-owned Great Shipping Company, which are mostly British, there are also Italian shipping companies operating ten ships and German shipping companies operating seven ships, among which</p>
<p>Chinese capital is considerable. The shipping industry believes that if the Sino-Portuguese Shipping Company succeeds, the Japanese may confiscate other ships and, under the guise of the "East Asia New Order," further gradually deprive third countries of their shipping business.</p>
<h3>Ningbo is Quiet, Rumors of Japanese Bombing Yesterday, Telegrams Make No Mention</h3>
<p>There were rumors in this city a few days ago that Japanese planes had bombed Ningbo, but telegrams received by the shipping industry proved it to be untrue. Yesterday morning, rumors of Japanese planes bombing Ningbo resurfaced in Shanghai, causing people from Ningbo to inquire anxiously. The Dagong News Agency reporter learned from the shipping industry that yesterday morning, the various shipping companies received no fewer than a dozen telegrams from Ningbo, all stating that Ningbo was quiet and made no mention of Japanese bombing. Therefore, it can be proven that the previous rumors were absolutely untrue. Moreover, there was heavy snow in Ningbo yesterday, and the weather was gloomy, making it impossible for Japanese planes to operate at all.</p>
<h3>Snowstorm on the Road, Hunger and Cold Pressing, Relief at a Critical Juncture, Tzu Yu Hui Distributing Clothes in an Orderly Manner, Flat-Price Grain Donations Amount to 650,000, Distribution of Steamed Buns Changed to Hwa Lo Road</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been bitterly cold for days, and people are freezing to death in droves. Yesterday, there was even a snowstorm, and civilians without clothes or food are unlikely to survive the winter. Fortunately, various charitable organizations and philanthropists are simultaneously distributing clothes and food, working day and night without rest, comforting the suffering compatriots and joining in the righteous cause. The Tzu Yu Hui Association is distributing children's clothing, with hundreds waiting in line in an orderly manner. The Moore Memorial Church is distributing food, and the crowd is even more crowded, with the number of people receiving steamed buns increasing every night, reaching more than 6,000.</p>
<p>Flat-Price Grain Amount</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Flat-Price Grain Committee actively solicited donations for the sustained operation of flat-price grain, the Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the committee's secretariat yesterday that (1) donations solicited, determined by various industries and individuals voluntarily donating, totaled about 650,000 national currency, and about 550,000 national currency has been paid to the receiving agencies. It is now hoped that all sectors will act with a sense of shared hunger and drowning, contributing grain and gold, and providing continuous assistance, which would be a great fortune for the poor in this port. (2) Purchase of flat-price grain: the first purchase was 20,068 bags of spot goods, and 15,000 bags were ordered, which have arrived in Shanghai and are stored in warehouses. The second batch of purchases was 5,000 bags of spot goods, and 11,000 bags were ordered, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the tenth of January, for a total purchase of 51,068 bags, including spot goods and orders. (3) The 50 flat-price grain distribution points in the two concessions have decided to continue operating the flat-price grain distribution, limited to 50 bags per location per day, with the price remaining at six and a half catties per yuan. The flat-price grain distribution time remains from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM until the grain is sold out.</p>
<p>Distribution of Steamed Buns</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the Charity Organizations Joint Council, the number of people receiving steamed buns distributed by the council every night on Xin Dagu Road has increased to more than 6,000. The flour used for distributing steamed buns every night has increased to 50 bags, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the society will continuously donate. Due to the increasing number of people waiting for distribution every day, the Xin Dagu Road area is unable to accommodate such a large crowd. Therefore, the council has decided to change the distribution location to the intersection of Avenue Road and Dahua Road starting tonight, with the time remaining from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM. It is hoped that the poor waiting for distribution will pay attention. The council also received 110 yuan from Zhao Jinqing and others yesterday, designated for the needs of steamed buns for the relief of the poor.</p>
<p>Appeal for Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Solicitation Committee, in order to appeal to various industry guilds and major merchants to save money on New Year's Eve banquets and help refugees, sent a letter to various industry guilds yesterday, saying, "Respected sirs, time flies, and the end of the year is approaching. According to custom, there is a practice of eating New Year's Eve dinner. Last year, our association, considering the refugee problem to be quite serious, sent letters and published advertisements appealing to save money on New Year's Eve banquets and transfer it to relief expenses. Fortunately, various industries and major merchants understood the difficult times, were enthusiastic about public welfare, and acted generously, raising a considerable amount of money to benefit the refugees. It was truly extraordinary. Now, the national crisis has not been resolved, and prices are soaring, making the lives of our compatriots even more threatened. At this time of year, although we have the financial resources to eat New Year's Eve dinner, we have a sense of empathy, which everyone has. When we think of the refugees in dilapidated shelters, suffering from hunger and cold, how can we bear to swallow delicious food even when it is in front of us? Therefore, we make another appeal, knowing that your association has always been extremely enthusiastic about relief, and that all colleagues and merchants have compassionate hearts. Therefore, we hope that you will actively promote and join in the righteous cause, saving as much money as possible on New Year's Eve banquets and transferring it to relief expenses. We also hope that you will send the savings directly to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association at 93 Guangdong Road, and also inform our association by letter for verification. We will be infinitely grateful."</p>
<h3>Yangtze River to Open, Japanese Spokesman Declares, Within February</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that at a reception for journalists last night (29th), when asked whether there had been any changes to the decision to reopen the Yangtze River to foreign ships, or whether the previous proposal had been cancelled, a Japanese military spokesman replied that, as far as Shanghai was concerned, the Yangtze River would be reopened in February, as originally announced by Tokyo. However, the exact date of the opening would be announced by Tokyo. It is understood that many details related to this issue are now under study. The first announcement of the opening of the Yangtze River two months later was made in December of last year, so the opening date should be in February of this year. Shanghai has not received any news to the contrary.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Shoots Korean, Indictment Not True, Constable Performing Duty, Has the Right to Fulfill Duty</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the rumor that a public concession Chinese constable who shot a Korean, Kim Qing-geun (transliteration), on Guangdong Road on the afternoon of the 28th of this month would be prosecuted has been denied by the police department. It is said that the constable has the right to shoot the Korean in fulfilling his duty. According to reports, the Korean, aged 29, was wearing Chinese clothing. On the afternoon of the 28th, when he saw a patrol team approaching near Guangdong Road and Henan Road, he ran away, and a Chinese constable shot him in the foot. He was then taken to Fumin Hospital by the Fire Brigade ambulance.</p>
<h3>British Ship Detained, About to Negotiate, British Embassy News, Studying Report</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the British naval authorities in this city will soon negotiate with the Japanese authorities regarding the detention of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s British ship Yong Sheng Hao by a Japanese warship off the coast of Fujian last Wednesday and the dispatch of troops to board the ship. Yesterday (29th), a spokesman for the British Embassy said that the phrase "about to negotiate" would be inaccurate if it were taken to mean the lodging of a protest, as a detailed report on the matter was now being studied. The manner in which the negotiations would be conducted had not yet been decided, and could be either oral or written. It is understood that the British naval authorities have already had contact with the Japanese naval authorities on this matter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Threatening Remarks, Dissatisfied with Concession Control of Anti-Japanese Elements, Actually Considering Actions to Deal with Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reports that a Japanese army spokesman stated yesterday (29th) that Japanese army officials in Shanghai may not be satisfied with the control of anti-Japanese elements in the Public and French Concessions, are studying methods, and considering actions to deal with this situation. As for</p>
<p>the nature of these methods, he could not disclose them due to his position. However, given the nature of the Public and French Concessions, this issue cannot be resolved unilaterally by the Japanese. When asked whether the situation here would develop into a blockade similar to that now imposed on the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the spokesman replied that this was purely a</p>
<p>hypothetical question to which he would not reply. The Japanese commander in Tianjin considered it necessary to impose a blockade, and therefore implemented blockade measures, the purpose of which had been clearly stated, namely, to prevent anti-Japanese elements from entering Japanese-occupied areas.</p>
<h3>President Quezon Not Sunk, Heavily Damaged After Grounding, Ship's Hull Sank, Sea Water Ingress</h3>
<p>Regarding the previous report that the Philippine ship President Quezon had sunk near Kagoshima in Japanese waters after hitting a reef, the ship's agent in this city, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Foreign Shipping Department, received a telegram from the crew in Japan yesterday stating that the ship had grounded, not hit a reef. However, after grounding on the beach, the rear of the ship's hull sank, the bow rose, and the ship's hull was severely damaged. Sea water entered, and the crew had been rescued by a Japanese ship and evacuated to Japan. As for the ship's towing and repair, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., as the agent, has no say and must await instructions from the Philippine head office.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Slow Train Resumes Service, But Must Change Trains at Baisai and Xiaolongtan, Fast Train and Freight Train No Resumption Date Yet</h3>
<p>The Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway (i.e., from Hekou to Kunming) has had a railway bridge slightly damaged between Wantang and Baisai after being bombed by Japanese aircraft. The bridge deck is undamaged, and the tracks have also been repaired. The bridge pier iron frame is still being repaired and replaced. Heavier vehicles cannot pass. It is expected that it will be fully repaired in the near future.</p>
<p>Destroyed Railway Bridge: Another railway bridge was bombed about one kilometer from Xiaolongtan Station. The bridge beam on the Xiaolongtan side fell into the rapids, while the other end was still resting on the opposite bank. The railway company used wooden frames from the shore to the fallen part of the bridge, and then erected wooden ladders on the inclined track of the railway bridge to facilitate pedestrians. It is still safe to cross the bridge. This section can only be repaired in about two or three months. Therefore, it is necessary to change trains twice along the way from Hekou to Kunming. Therefore, the fast train and freight train on this route are still suspended. The date of resumption is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Slow Train Service: The slow train has resumed service. The schedule of trains from Haiphong to Lao Cai (Vietnam section) remains normal. The fastest journey takes one day. The train departs from Hekou around 7:00 AM the next morning. The first train change is required at Baisai, around 11:00 AM. Only the bridge is damaged here, and a ferry can be used. However, there are no coolies available for hire, so it is necessary to bring local villagers from Baisai Station to help. There is no great inconvenience. After departing from Kaiyuan on the morning of the third day, the train arrives at the damaged section (Xiaolongtan) in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Carrying Luggage: The railway company has hired about 300 temporary coolies. The railway will carry luggage for first, second, and third-class passengers, limited to 30 kilograms per person. Fourth-class passengers must hire their own coolies to carry their luggage, costing about one yuan per coolie. However, if the luggage is heavy, it may cost two or three yuan per person. Walking about one li, one arrives at the transfer point. The transfer time is limited, and passengers scramble to be first, causing great confusion. There is too much luggage to take care of, resulting in losses. Therefore, it is best to bring as little luggage as possible. The transfer when traveling from Kunming to Fang is at night, and the situation is even more chaotic.</p>
<p>Overnight Stay in Hekou: In order to facilitate immigration inspection, the Hekou authorities have notified passengers traveling from Fang to Kunming that they must cross the river into Hekou between 10:00 AM and 2:30 PM every day. Therefore, passengers cannot take the train to Kunming the next morning and must stay in Hekou for one day. There is only one hotel in Hekou, the Natural Hotel, and demand exceeds supply. Unless one is quick, one cannot find accommodation. In summary, the three-day journey of the past now takes at least five days to complete. The increase in ticket prices for the Vietnam section has also increased. Calculated according to two yuan and nine jiao in Vietnamese currency for each customs gold unit, the one-way first-class fare from Haiphong to Kunming is 91 yuan and 78 fen in Vietnamese currency, second-class is 63 yuan, third-class is 36 yuan and 7 fen, and fourth-class is about 13 yuan.</p>
<h3>Romanian Minister to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that the Romanian Minister to Japan, Balakial Valsco, has arrived in Shanghai and is staying at the Capital Hotel. According to reports, Mr. Balakial is a doctor of law from the University of Paris and is rich in diplomatic experience. He succeeded Stucesco as Minister to Japan last year.</p>

<h3>Difficult Navigation on Shanghai-Wenzhou Route, No News of Ships from Shanghai to Wenzhou, No Definite Way to Take Passengers</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese landed in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Zhejiang route has gradually become more frequent due to the needs of passenger traffic. In the past, people traveling from Shanghai to various parts of eastern Zhejiang all went through Ningbo. Now, due to the crowding of passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo route and the difficulty of purchasing tickets, in addition to Wenzhou passengers requesting the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to take passengers, it is learned that Haidou in Zhejiang also has people taking sailboats from there to land and transfer to various parts of eastern Zhejiang. Some passengers also plan to request the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to take passengers, and if it can also stop at Haimen, the journey will be more convenient. However, the ships operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line are sometimes hindered in Wenzhou's navigation, and Haimen is a blocked area. It is not certain whether the ships can sail to Taizhou, so no responsibility is taken along the way. Recently, there have been people from various counties in Wenzhou traveling to Shanghai, asking the Wenzhou Association in Shanghai and Wenzhou shops to guarantee their travel to Wenzhou. As for the Yonghua, Manli, Maler, and Xinanna three ships that departed from Shanghai a few days ago, due to continuous rain and snow, navigation outside Wenzhou is difficult. Therefore, the shipping companies have not received any telegrams from the ships arriving safely in Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Soliciting Luggage: On the 11th of this month, the Lihe Yanghang's Moufu ship arrived outside Zhenhai Port from Shanghai. During the transfer to barges, many luggage was lost in various barges due to passenger congestion. The Ningbo Inspection Team has repeatedly found and notified people to claim them. There are still 13 pieces of boxes, rattan boxes, etc., that have not been claimed. It is now specially limited to 14 days to submit detailed accounts, provide guarantees, and claim them from the Inspection Team.

<p>Prohibited Goods Released After Fines: The Wenzhou authorities have strict restrictions on import and export cargo, stipulating that they must first register with the Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce. However, cargo merchants also have goods transported to Wenzhou that have not been registered in advance due to the Shanghai-Wenzhou route being uncertain. According to the shipping industry, the Oujiang Import and Export Cargo Inspection Office has recently found many prohibited imports among the unregistered imports. According to regulations, they should be detained, but in order to alleviate business difficulties, it has been decided to impose fines of up to one-tenth of the cargo value. Merchants have now been ordered to pay the full amount before the goods can be released.</p>
<p>Water Mine Explosion: According to the shipping industry, a water mine placed by the Japanese at the mouth of the Jiaojiang River recently drifted to the foot of Qiansuo Mountain with the tide. When seen by coastal fishermen, they tried to salvage it. Unfortunately, due to carelessness, it suddenly exploded, killing four fishermen and seriously injuring one. Now, fishermen in the vicinity regard the waterways around the Jiaojiang and Oujiang Rivers as dangerous places.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Daily News, Suspended for Two Weeks, Chinese Newspaper Also Temporarily Ceases Publication</h3>
<p>The American-owned Sino-American Daily News in this port received a notice from the Public Concession Municipal Council Police Department yesterday afternoon (31st) to suspend publication for two weeks from today (31st) to the 13th of next month. This newspaper was previously notified by the Municipal Council Police Department to suspend publication for two weeks on May 19 of last year due to the publication of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's . Later, on September 18, it was ordered to suspend publication for three weeks due to the exposure of scum in the educational field in this city on the education edition. This newspaper is a purely American-owned newspaper, but it has been ordered to suspend publication three times in its short history of just over a year due to its strict stance and upholding of justice, which is a pity for the general public. It is also learned that after the suspension period expires, the newspaper will resume publication on the 14th of next month, maintaining its consistent stance.</p>
<p>The Chinese newspaper in this city was founded in June of last year and has been published for eight months. This newspaper has always emphasized practicality and not extravagance. Therefore, its remarks have always been fair and its attitude extremely impartial. In particular, it has made every effort to promote China's war of resistance national policy in order to awaken the strong beliefs of the Shanghai citizens. Recently, due to the environmental conditions in Shanghai, the newspaper believes that it is necessary to reorganize internally and refresh its lineup in order to cope with the more difficult situation in the future. Therefore, it has temporarily ceased publication, and will meet the readers in Shanghai again with its past spirit after the reorganization is completed.</p>

<h3>Various Foreign Banks Earn High Profits, but Japanese Banks' Situation is Extremely Depressed</h3>
<p>Foreign banks in Shanghai all had significant surpluses in their 1939 annual business settlements. Although the exact figures are unknown, their reports have already been sent to their respective headquarters for review. A reporter from the Daguang News Agency learned from financial circles yesterday that among the foreign banks with the highest surpluses last year, HSBC ranked first, followed by Mercantile, Citibank, and British Bank of China, and then by Chartered, American Express, and Banque de l'Indochine, etc. HSBC and Mercantile profited considerably from the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the autumn of last year, when speculators, both Chinese and foreign, flocked to the market. Subsequently, with the outbreak of the European war, the British authorities placed Hong Kong under wartime conditions, declaring restrictions on the export of gold notes, gold pounds, and other currencies. These two banks, with government approval, received special allocations of foreign exchange and currency, and their business continued to develop as usual. Citibank and American Express, due to America's neutral position after the European war, not only remained unaffected in domestic and foreign finance, but also saw deposits from other foreign banks flow to them. All foreign exchange business, due to smooth trade between China and the United States, also surged forward, increasing several times. Although the surplus amount was not as high as that of British banks, the results were still very impressive. Other banks, such as British Bank of China, Chartered, and Banque de l'Indochine, handled a large volume of foreign exchange with the South Sea Islands and the Americas, and their surpluses were also considerable. As for the Japanese banks, such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui, and Sumitomo, their continuous aggression against China and drastic changes in domestic and foreign finance caused them to incur substantial losses from speculative purchases of foreign exchange. Various deposits and loans have almost come to a standstill. Most of their daily busy work involves remitting operational military expenses or negotiating the purchase of military supplies, so the situation appears quite bleak.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Water and Electricity Utilities Completely Seized, Chinese Workers Subjected to Torture</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Nanshi, the water and electricity utilities of Nanshi have been under the control of the Japanese "Central China Water and Electricity Corporation." The company's office is located in the Shanghai Bank building in Laoximen. However, the workers are still mostly Chinese. On the 26th of this month, two Chinese workers, both around thirty years old, were suddenly accused of stealing electric wires. They were tied to electric poles on both sides of the road and left exposed to hunger, cold, and starvation for three days and nights, from the 27th onwards until yesterday. It is now reported that they have been sent to the Japanese military police for punishment.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Laboratory's Typewriter Stolen, Both Thief and Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council's laboratory on Route Cardinal Mercier was burglarized the night before last, and three typewriters were stolen. A wooden ladder was left at the scene of the theft. The French police immediately began investigating and learned that the stolen machines were hidden in house number 229, Lane 131, Guangxi Road. They then went to the location in the afternoon, together with public concession police officers, searched the premises, recovered the stolen machines, and arrested a man named Ma inside the house. He was taken back to the police station and confessed to the theft. Ma and four accomplices broke into the laboratory, first prying open a door, then entering the first floor of the laboratory, using ropes to lower the machines, and moving them to Ma's hiding place.</p>
<h3>Father and Son Traffic Opium, Xiao Shunqing Arrested, Xiao Lianye Still at Large</h3>
<p>Ye Yuxi, a Chinese detective sergeant in the Public Concession's Narcotics Division, and his subordinate Li Shugui, recently arrested opium traffickers Guan Songshan and Zhou Shide at No. 55, Lane 147, Xin Guan Road, and sent them to the Special Court No. 1. During interrogation, they confessed that the opium belonged to the fugitive masterminds, Xiao Lianye and Xiao Shunqing, father and son. Guan and Zhou were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, and warrants were issued for the arrest and interrogation of the Xiaos. Yesterday afternoon, the investigating officers arrested Xiao Shunqing at room 226 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Xiao Lianye is still at large. Xiao Shunqing was taken into custody at the police station and sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. The judge briefly questioned Xiao Shunqing and ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>A Review of Shanghai Industry in 1939 (5) - The Municipal Council's Annual Report (3)</h3>
<p>Since last year, the Industrial Section and the Public Works Department began to implement a registration system for boiler manufacturers. A total of twenty-three boiler manufacturers have registered, each employing an approved engineer. The manufacture of all boilers must be supervised by these engineers. Once the factories have been inspected on time, their products can meet the proper drawings, and the boiler plates used are all qualified after identification. The factory reports the number to the Industrial Section when applying for a permit through the engineer. The manufacturing process is also supervised. The quality of products made in this city has now been improved. The price of all tested boiler plates has increased two and a half times, and it is commendable that such results can still be maintained. A total of twenty-eight permits have been issued, including seven boilers that have been found to have been shipped to other places. This shows that boilers with higher standards have been promoted to other places. In the future, all unsuitable boilers in this city will gradually be eliminated, so that all boilers used in factories within the jurisdiction of this bureau will be made of tested boiler plates.</p>
<p>Industrial Disputes</p>
<p>At present, people's livelihoods are difficult, so disputes often occur in various industries. The Industrial Section does its best to mediate such disputes or strikes. When the Special Branch of the Police Department encounters such disputes, it often transfers the cases to the Industrial Section for handling and cooperates closely with the section in order to eliminate them. Labor and management in factories also often directly ask the section for assistance. The current population of this city is overly crowded, and there are many unemployed people. If there are disturbances in factories, it is extremely important to find ways to eliminate them as early as possible for the sake of public safety and not allow them to spread. Factories in various industries have found it difficult to maintain business, so the losses suffered by factories due to work stoppages should be reduced as much as possible. Moreover, tens of thousands of unemployed workers are relying on social assistance, so how can workers who already have jobs lose their opportunity to make a living? In view of this, the Industrial Section dispatches personnel to mediate industrial disputes as early as possible in order to prevent work stoppages to the extent practically possible. If there are strikes, they strive to find ways to resume work as soon as possible. Last year, the section mediated a total of fifty-nine disputes, of which twelve were resolved successfully without strikes. The remaining forty-seven resulted in a total of 69,406 days of work lost due to strikes. Seven cases were resolved because the Industrial Section reached agreements with factory owners and workers on three sides. (End)</p>
<h3>Water Police Detective Obstructed During Patrol, One Even Threatened with a Gun, Western Detective Bravely Arrests Three</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, a Western detective from the Customs Water Police, Mann Feit, together with a Chinese policeman, was patrolling the Suzhou Creek in the Hongkou area just after 9:30 this morning (the 30th) and boarded a Chinese cargo ship moored on the shore to make inquiries. Suddenly, seven Chinese men approached in a sampan and also boarded the cargo ship, forcing Mann to leave the ship. One of them even pulled out a gun and pointed it at Mann. However, Mann and the Chinese policeman were not intimidated and immediately pounced on the seven men. In a short time, they had captured three of them. The remaining four, including the one with the gun, were terrified and fled in all directions. Mann was not injured. A Japanese naval sentry arrived on the scene, and Mann explained what had happened to him. A patrol team from the Hongkou Police also arrived soon after. Without being obstructed by the Japanese sentry, they escorted the three men to the Hongkou Police Station and transferred them to the General Police Station. They will be interrogated by the First Special Court tomorrow (the 31st).</p>
<h3>Ticket Sellers Extensively Employ Skimming Tactics, Even Hiring Lookouts, Zhang Wenbin Arrested and Fined</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the population has surged, and all kinds of transportation vehicles are crowded, especially trams and buses. Recently, many tram ticket sellers in the Public Concession have been extensively employing skimming tactics and, for convenience, have even hired several lookouts, stationed at key locations. If they see plainclothes Chinese or Western ticket inspectors, they will notify the ticket sellers in advance so that they can take precautions. The day before yesterday afternoon, a plainclothes Western ticket inspector on Seymour Road and Jing'an Temple Road suddenly saw a ticket seller give nine jiao in change to Zhang Wenbin, a lookout. He was immediately apprehended and taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin charged him with aiding embezzlement. After questioning and obtaining a clear confession, the judge sentenced Zhang to a fine of twenty yuan as a warning for aiding others in occupational embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Opium Seized on Norwegian Ship, Weighing 3,000 Taels, Value 150,000</h3>
<p>According to the French-language *Shanghai Journal*, the Water Patrol seized a large quantity of opium last night on the Norwegian ship *Sanveigun*, which came to Shanghai from South China. The contraband was hidden under cargo in the ship's hold, totaling 3,000 taels in weight, with a current market value of approximately 150,000 yuan. After receiving a report in advance, customs tax police and water patrol officers were dispatched to wait at the ship's hold to prevent the drugs from being leaked. The smugglers, seeing the situation, realized they had been exposed and did not proceed to unload the cargo. Therefore, the source and owner of the opium are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Leaders from All Circles Advocate Establishing a Poor People's Hospital for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Requesting 20,000 Yuan in Aid</h3>

<h3>Tongrenhe Paint Store Lawsuit, Manager Petitions for Confirmation of Letter's Invalidity, Further Hearing Ordered Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tongrenhe Paint Store, located at 80 Avenue de la Republique in the French Concession, is a long-established store founded seventy years ago by members of the You family clan from Suzhou. The current manager, Xu Chengxun from Yuyao, had a sales dispute with shareholders You Huai and Gao in September of last year. After auditing the accounts, Xu was suspected of embezzlement. Shareholder You Huai appointed lawyer Qiu Fenling as his representative and reported the matter to the French police on December 30, requesting an investigation. The police chief approved the request and sent a detective to summon Xu Chengxun for questioning and to collect the account books for investigation. Xu appointed lawyer Xu Wufang to appear in court, forcing Xu to sign a settlement, dismissing Xu from his position, forfeiting his earned bonuses, and waiving the sales dispute investigation. Xu later felt dissatisfied and hired a lawyer to publish a statement declaring the previous letter invalid. He also appointed lawyer Gao Danhua as his agent and filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against shareholder You Huai, seeking confirmation that the letter was invalid. The defendant, You Huai, also appointed lawyers Qiu Fenling and Xu Jie to file a defense. Judge Chen Ziguan held a hearing and ordered a further hearing at a later date. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. This case was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Chen in the Fourth Civil Court. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. The plaintiff, Xu Chengxun, stated that he had studied at Tongtaixiang and later became the manager of the store, a position he had held for twelve years. He has been in the paint industry for a total of twenty-five years. His monthly salary was 120 yuan and was increased to 144 yuan this year. His annual bonus was 10% of profits, and he also received a special bonus of 10%. Because he worked too hard in managing the store, he suffered from spitting blood and insomnia since 1937. Since the outbreak of the European war, he is suspected to be owed 820,000 yuan in profits, including over 160,000 yuan in special bonuses. Shareholder You Huai had a disagreement with him over goods and falsely accused him of embezzlement. Because there was no solid evidence, he was forced to sign a settlement. Therefore, he specially filed a lawsuit requesting confirmation that the illegal document was invalid. The court ordered the case to be heard again on the 16th, as the witness, lawyer Xu Wufang, still needed to be summoned to court. At the same time, Tongrenhe employee Chen Chuncheng and others, because You Huai moved the store's inventory, obtained permission from the Second Special Court on the morning of the 29th to implement a provisional attachment of a portion of the inventory moved to Tongtaixiang and Ruifeng Warehouse.</p>

Only constrained by old customs, she lamented that she had met the wrong person and had a poor fate. After the August 13th Incident, the woman returned to her mother's home to live. Since then, Ma Mingzhen has become even more mentally disturbed. The woman felt that she could no longer live with him as a nominal couple. She hired lawyer Yin Tinghua as her agent and filed a request with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court to mediate the termination of the marital relationship. As a result, the other party did not appear, and the mediation failed. The woman has now formally filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the court, seeking alimony of 50 yuan per month until she reaches the age of 50, totaling 15,000 yuan in national currency for five years. According to the complaint, the court held a hearing in the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Li Liang. The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court and stated the reasons for the lawsuit and the object of the litigation. The defendant did not appear and was represented by his sister-in-law, Ma Shi's, who hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to represent him, claiming that the defendant had gone to his hometown in Nanjing and requesting a postponement.

<p>Yesterday, the supply from inland areas was cut off due to rain and snow, causing inconvenience to transportation. As a result, the market sentiment became firm and expensive. Merchants' stocks were scarce, and merchants seeking to close out previous transactions and sell off their goods also saw little activity. As a result, some market goods were hoarded by sellers, and prices were repeatedly raised. The market trends reversed the previous declines, except for thick and thin japonica and early and late indica rice, which were subject to price controls and opened at the controlled price of 40 yuan. Various types of foreign rice saw sharp increases. No. 1 Saigon opened at 41 yuan and closed at 41.3 yuan. No. 2 Saigon reached 40.3 yuan. Fire-milled was 39.7 yuan, and large-milled was 37.4 yuan. Tokyo point rose from 37.67 yuan to 37.4 yuan. Rice grits were 31.3 yuan, and special rice bran was 37.2 to 37 yuan. Almost all of the price declines of the previous market have been recovered, with increases ranging from 7-8 jiao to nearly 1 yuan. Glutinous rice also followed with increases of 3-5 jiao. Hong Kong white was opened at 40 yuan. There were no goods available for sale for Luxiang Point.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, new orders were quiet, and returns from stored goods continued to be brisk due to the greed of hoarders. Although there were no large actual sales of current foreign rice, hoarders inside and outside the industry remained active. The return price for No. 2 original packaged opened at 49.3 yuan, while the current No. 2 was 40.1 yuan, and No. 1 was 41.23 yuan, all being mid-range market goods. High-grade Saigon has not opened, and sellers are demanding prices above 41.5 yuan. In the foreign rice futures market, arrangements were made to continuously connect to the source, and the rice price continued to rise, which was actually caused by the mutual exploitation of hoarders and rice merchants.</p>
<p>Additional News</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive continuously. Yesterday, another 6,478 bags arrived, loaded from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel. They arrived yesterday afternoon, but the hatches were not opened due to the heavy snow and will be unloaded after the weather clears today. (Year)</p>
<h3>Current Flour Shortage: High Prices for Returned Goods Repeatedly Emerge</h3>
<p>Spot Trading in Flour: The market is gradually becoming brisk, mainly because the wholesale prices from various flour mills to this street have not yet increased, but supply restrictions are becoming stricter. Even for orders of 50 or 100 bags, one must plead for favor, leading to the regret of wanting to buy but finding no goods. According to market rumors, the issue of raising mill prices may have to wait until the Lunar New Year, and an increase of half a yuan may still be insufficient. Therefore, the mill price increase of one yuan is likely to be realized soon. However, new orders and arrivals of foreign wheat are continuous. It's unknown whether the market will be affected. Amidst this increasing shortage of spot flour, the amount of returned goods available is also decreasing. Those holding goods are treating them as rare commodities. The warehouse receipt price for "Green Cannon Truck" brand has reached over twelve yuan, and "Battleship" brand has also risen from eleven yuan six jiao to eleven yuan eight jiao. Warehouse receipts for "Old Truck" brand share the same fate.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Trading: Also appears quiet, mainly because the supply is currently delayed, and reserves are scarce. Sellers are determined to hold on and unwilling to sell easily. Chinese mills intend to curtail purchases, repeatedly spreading news of foreign wheat orders and arrivals. According to the first batch of Australian wheat ordered by flour mills, more than a month has passed, and it should have arrived in Shanghai. However, this has not been definitively confirmed. The remaining goods will also arrive in February and March. Furthermore, it was heard yesterday that a certain mill ordered another shipment at a price of twenty-five yuan six jiao. This year's Australian wheat harvest is estimated to be abundant, with large amounts available for export. Recently, foreign merchants have indeed been actively soliciting wheat business. However, due to the current flour market conditions and environment, the buying and selling of domestic wheat are both being curtailed, and there have been no formal transactions in the entire city. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the overall situation is in a state of winding down.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Minor Transactions in Yellow Soybeans</h3>
<p>Yesterday's trading in miscellaneous grains, though not entirely quiet, saw only minor transaction volumes. The market situation is in a winding-down phase, with no formal market activity. Overall, buying and selling were inconsistent. Yesterday, apart from southern merchants handling Doudousha yellow soybeans, the rest were for the appetite of囤戶 [speculators/hoarders]. A total of six hundred bags of Kai Ding Jia Zhou soybeans were traded (price details in the market column), as well as two cartloads of Nanjing soybeans, two hundred bags of Wuhu soybeans, one cartload of Jiangbei soybeans, one hundred bags of Pinghu Doudou soybeans, one hundred and fifty-three bags of Chongming Sand Yellow soybeans, one hundred bags of 蚌石 [Bangshi] soybeans, eighty-six bags of Jiangbei green soybeans, seventy-nine bags of 管店雪蔴 [Guan Dian Xue Ma], ninety bags of Pinghu 揀蠶 [Jian Can], and fifty-odd bags of 奔牛 [Ben Niu] red beans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two thousand four hundred and eighty bags of soybeans and five hundred bags of 生仁 [raw kernels] are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Raw Soybean Oil: Only囤戶 [speculators/hoarders] Scouring for Goods</h3>
<p>The oil market is scheduled to complete all closing procedures today. The formal market will have to wait until the fifth day of the Lunar New Year to reopen. Therefore, the market conditions for soybean oil and peanut oil saw little change yesterday. Transactions were limited to this street buying fifteen barrels of Dalian crude soybean oil at a price of one hundred yuan, and 囤戶 [speculators/hoarders] scouring for one hundred pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil at a price of eighty-one yuan. In addition, three hundred 廳 [cans/containers] of raw oil are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Finance: Chinese Merchant Activity, Foreign Exchange Tightens</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The informal market for British and American exchange rates was generally quiet, but ultimately tightened, influenced by widespread rumors in the evening that the Tianjin exchange market had tightened. Throughout the day, the market initially opened flat, but later softened due to settlements by importers and purchases by Chinese firms and Sassoon, falling to 4/65625 for British pounds and 7.75 for US dollars. This was because Hong Kong telegraphs were offering sales, and Sassoon was also liquidating spot positions. Therefore, the market soon returned to flat. Trade was thin at noon, and the market was dull. In the afternoon, the market initially showed slight easing due to continued sales from Hong Kong telegraphs. The lowest price for US dollars seen was 7.84375 bought by foreign firms. At the same time, British pounds also returned to 4/703125. Later in the day, news suddenly spread that foreign exchange in Tianjin had sharply tightened, and favorable buying emerged, prompting activity from a small number of Chinese merchants. However, foreign firms' willingness to supply was weak. Therefore, at the close, the rates were only reported at 4/65625 and 7.75. As a result, the British pound was tighter than the US dollar, by .03125, due to the continued appreciation of the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound. The trend for futures was no different from that for spot.</p>
<p>Sassoon Offered Spot Goods and Entered Long-Term Positions</p>
<p>Early in the morning, due to London's large volume, both near-term and long-term contracts fell by 125. New York silver prices remained flat, and London spot gold was stable. The exchange rate between British pounds and US dollars, Shanghai yuan, and French francs were all flat. The US dollar appreciated against the British pound by 785, depreciated against the Shanghai yuan by 05, and appreciated against the French franc by 625. Central Bank's listed rates for all currencies remained unchanged. At the bank's morning opening, spot selling prices were 4/6875 for British pounds and 7.78125 for US dollars, showing no change compared to the previous close. After the opening, the market was quiet and dull. The disclosure of the silver equalization tax showed a small increase of 0.75. Later, foreign firms made settlements, and Chinese firms and Sassoon also made purchases, causing the market to soften slightly. Foreign firms settled February US dollar contracts at 7.625, Sassoon absorbed February British pound contracts at 4/625, and Chinese firms also purchased large amounts of spot US dollars from Chase Bank at 7.78125 and 7.75. At the same time, spot British pounds also softened to 4/65625. Subsequently, the market returned to flat due to a sudden offering of sales from Hong Kong telegraphs, and Sassoon followed suit. Hong Kong telegraphs sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 7.78125 and 7.815, and also sold February US dollar contracts to a certain bank at 7.6875. Sassoon also sold spot British pounds to Jardine Matheson at 4/6875, and spot US dollars at 7.8125. Trading was dull at noon. Extending until the close, British pounds remained at 4/6875, and US dollars were at 7.8125, a decrease of 03125 from the morning opening for US dollars due to exchange rate appreciation.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Continued to Sell, Jardine Matheson Bought</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon, the market showed slight easing due to continued sales from Hong Kong telegraphs. A certain bank, being the most aggressive, bought spot US dollars at 7.84375. At the same time, foreign firms' buying price for British pounds also returned to 4/703125. Later in the day, news suddenly spread that the exchange rate in Tianjin was continuing to tighten, and British pounds had fallen to 4/, and Jardine Matheson suddenly showed buying interest, absorbing spot US dollars from peers at 7.8125. Therefore, a small number of Chinese merchants also wanted to join in, but foreign firms' willingness to supply was extremely weak. Until the close, spot British pounds were only reported at 4/65625, and US dollars were only at 7.75. Next month's futures for British pounds were at 4/609375, and US dollars were at 7.625. As a result, both near-term British pounds and US dollars were tighter by 03125 compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Hearts Aspire to Prosperity: Gold Market Revived in the Evening, Pulled Up to 4125 Yuan After Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold暗盤 [black market/unofficial market] conditions saw an uncertain trend, resulting in a nominal fall but an actual rise. In the evening, it surged to a high price of four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan, mainly because rumors spread after the market closed that the Tianjin market had tightened. Therefore, people's hearts turned, leading to securities firms and gold shops scrambling to absorb. Looking at the day's trading as a whole, the morning opening was good, at four thousand one hundred and seventeen yuan, an increase of nine yuan, but a certain money exchange business pressed prices to sell aggressively, and securities firms and cash also liquidated, pushing the price down to four thousand and ninety yuan. Later, the exchange market reported tightness, and retail investors rushed to buy, and securities firms and a certain money exchange business also absorbed, with Tianjin and Hong Kong factions operating in the shadows, causing it to rise to four thousand one hundred and ten yuan. Subsequently, with the foreign exchange market returning to flat, cash shops and gold shops came to sell again, and there was a temporary lack of buyers, so it fell to four thousand and eighty-six yuan. By the time before the noon close, a certain securities firm profited from covering short positions, and a certain gold shop also bought, so the closing was at four thousand and ninety-three yuan. The afternoon opening was flat, but because the securities firms and gold shops had good absorption power, it had risen to four thousand one hundred and one yuan by 3:00 PM. Later, due to a lack of buying, the market closed early. Unexpectedly, not long after the close, due to rumors of tightening in the Tianjin exchange market, and the local foreign exchange market also reported softening, people's hearts aspired to prosperity, and securities firms and gold shops revived buying interest. Although gold shops still offered sales at high prices, it was ultimately pulled up to four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan by 4:00 PM. Trading was still brisk throughout the day, at approximately one thousand seven hundred taels. Gold ornaments in gold shops remained the same as before, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Nominal Fall, Black Market Rise</p>
<p>From the morning opening, momentum was still tight, and retail investors once raised the price to four thousand one hundred and twenty yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business aggressively sold, first selling ten taels to a securities firm, with the opening price at four thousand one hundred and seventeen yuan, an increase of nine yuan from the previous close. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business continued to sell, and securities firms and cash shops also sold to each other, and at that time, there were few buyers, so it gradually fell by twenty-seven yuan, dropping below the four thousand one hundred yuan mark. The cash shop sold thirty taels to the money exchange business, for four thousand and ninety yuan. Later, with the foreign exchange market reporting tightness, retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the price immediately returned by ten yuan. Later, the money exchange business and securities firms searched on behalf of customers, and the price rose by another ten yuan. The securities firm bought twenty taels from the gold shop, for four thousand one hundred and ten yuan. Subsequently, with foreign exchange returning to ease, and a certain gold shop having a strong selling intention, the price again fell to four thousand and ninety-eight yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business once again bought on behalf of customers, immediately returning to four thousand one hundred and five yuan. After that, the buying appetite gradually weakened, and cash shops, gold shops, and securities firms competed to aggressively sell, and the price soon fell by nineteen yuan. The gold shop sold twenty taels to the gold shop, for four thousand and eighty-six yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly came back to buy, and the buying appetite of a certain gold shop was also good, and the price rose again, increasing by eleven yuan. The securities firm bought ten taels from the gold shop, for four thousand and ninety-seven yuan. However, because the cash shop seized the opportunity to sell again, the price was pressed down by four yuan again. The cash shop sold fifty taels to the gold shop, with the noon closing price at four thousand and ninety-three yuan. The afternoon opening price was raised by two yuan, with the gold shop buying twenty taels from the securities firm, for four thousand and ninety-five yuan. ... Soon after, the price fell by two yuan, with the gold shop selling twenty taels to the securities firm, for four thousand and ninety-three yuan. ...

The money exchange business bought ... taels from a certain gold shop, for four thousand one hundred and one yuan. At that time, because people's hearts were dispersed, the market closed early, and the upper price was used as the evening closing price. As a result, the price nominal fell by seven yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of thirty-one yuan throughout the day. Unexpectedly, around 3:00 PM, rumors suddenly spread that the Tianjin exchange rate had tightened, and the local foreign exchange market also suddenly reported tightening, which stirred people's hearts. A certain securities firm was the first to frantically buy, and gold shops also bought, and short positions covered, and by 4:00 PM, the price had risen by twenty-four yuan. A certain gold shop and gold shops each bought twenty taels from the gold shop, all for four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan. Compared to the previous day, the price rose by seventeen yuan.

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Discovered: Recent High Prices: Foreign Stocks Particularly Flourishing</h3>
<p>In yesterday's证券暗盤 [black market/unofficial market], market conditions, people's hearts are becoming increasingly firm and soaring, and trading is also gradually increasing. As the last day for accruing interest on连息 [interest-bearing securities] has arrived, interest will be excluded from calculations starting today. Due to a sudden surge in investment and short-covering transactions in the market, demand exceeded supply, and various types gradually reached their recent high prices. Class B has broken through the fifty-four yuan barrier, and all market prices closed at today's highest level, but buyers are still not satisfied. With the brewing of new US loans to China and the increasing surplus of Shanghai's floating capital recently, investment is gradually being activated, and there are hopes for future development. The trend was firm in the morning and suddenly rose in the afternoon. The supply of chips in the market suddenly became exhausted, and the financial sector also absorbed some. The clash between bulls and bears in the market became more pronounced, and short-covering also emerged, resulting in a continued rise of one jiao to five jiao and a half.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Merchants Rush to Buy Year-End Goods: Yarn Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned upward, mainly because although there were no large-scale purchases of coarse and fine yarns in South and North China, demand was still considered not weak. People's hearts were excited, and at the same time, general囤戶 [speculators/hoarders], seeing the improvement in the environment, were increasingly pulling and lifting prices. The market received this support and gradually moved forward. However, overseas cotton prices have turned downward, and the calculated price is now much cheaper than before, reducing the cost for mills.</p>

<h3>Coal: Hongji White Coal Black Market Tight</h3>
<p>Recently, because the end of the year is approaching and users are stocking up, white coal sales are very strong. It is heard that the discount of peers is also becoming tighter because of the skyrocketing of bituminous coal. Although Hongji White Coal still maintains the old price, it only issues現車 [delivery truck] but does not issue warehouse receipts, so people's hearts are extremely shaken and they are buying a lot.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Forced Price Increases</h3>
<p>— Liu Daohong</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, commodity prices have not only failed to decrease, but have instead been rising steadily, seemingly with an unstoppable momentum. No one dares to predict what the peak of the cost of living will be in the future!</p>
<p>Price increases naturally have their own inevitable difficulties; this can be seen from the price increase announcements of various industries, which state that costs have increased, and in order to maintain capital, they have no choice but to slightly increase the selling price to make up for it. It is a matter of course that businesses should make profits and not lose money. Therefore, we dare not criticize legitimate and reasonable price increases in various industries.</p>
<p>However, recently I saw in newspapers several announcements from trade associations warning members who did not raise prices that a few members were deliberately lowering selling prices, which was affecting other members, so those who did not sell at the new prices would be sanctioned.</p>
<p>This is really puzzling. We know that there is a popular saying in the business world, "Capital is the master," which tells us that merchants will certainly not lose money. I think there is no merchant in the world who would willingly lose money, especially in Shanghai today. Therefore, I can say with certainty that the members who are lowering selling prices that the trade association is referring to are simply less greedy than other members, and will certainly not voluntarily lose money. The fact that a few members do not raise prices after the association decides to raise prices shows that the price increase is not necessary, and not raising prices will not lead to losses. Of course, the profit after the price increase is much higher than the profit without the price increase!</p>
<p>It is already greatly wrong to raise prices when it is not necessary, but the association is still forcing members who are not greedy to raise prices as well, and shamelessly saying that those who do not raise prices will be sanctioned. What is this! Trade associations should certainly seek benefits for their members, but they cannot fail to consider the entire society. Trade associations that force members to raise prices like this are simply being manipulated and used by a few unscrupulous merchants who are blinded by greed! Such behavior is not only harmful to the association, but also the benefits obtained by various industries are not genuine. Because true benefits are bright and upright, not something that can be obtained by speculation.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that various associations in Shanghai will make a strong statement on this matter.</p>
<h3>After Tuition Fee Increase: A Parent's Plea</h3>
<p>— Chang Fang</p>
<p>My seven-year-old child is in the second grade at the elementary school in this alley. When the winter vacation report card was sent, it was accompanied by a mimeographed notice stating that the school would start on February 10th and tuition was due on February 2nd. Below the tuition payment section was a form indicating that the second-grade tuition was twelve yuan, an increase of two yuan from the previous semester. Additionally, there was a miscellaneous fee of one yuan noted, bringing the total to thirteen yuan (excluding the cost of books).</p>
<p>Of course, my child needs to continue schooling. An extra three yuan per semester is something this poor parent can "barely" manage. However, upon calculating the dates, I realized that the school starts on the third day of the first lunar month, yet the tuition must be paid in full before the New Year. This presents a bit of a dilemma, as my income budget does not include the expense of paying tuition before the New Year. I considered swallowing my pride and discussing the matter with the principal, given that we are neighbors in the alley, to request an extension until the start of the school term. However, the third day of the first lunar month is not a pay day either, so I suppose I will "barely" manage to prepare and pay on time.</p>
<p>Tuition fees have been raised (and the situation in other general alley elementary schools is probably similar). Aside from those parents who truly "cannot afford it," I would like to represent those of us who can still "barely" manage, and make a few requests to the principals:</p>
<p>(1) Please teach more diligently. Don't have the students go into the alley to pick water caltrops because the teacher is on leave. Telling stories is fine, or having students review old books or write in the classroom is also fine. Of course, it would be best if another teacher could substitute.</p>
<p>(2) I don't object to having one or two hours of singing class per week, but it is unacceptable to use singing to fill up the "schedule."</p>
<p>(3) Hold an exam every two weeks or every month, whether oral or written, to prevent the children from "parrot-fashion learning" and being at a loss when the so-called "big exam" arrives.</p>
<p>I have temporarily listed the above three points. These are the shortcomings I have observed in my child's school. Other alley elementary schools may not be like this, but the general situation is largely the same. In short, please "barely" exert a bit of teaching spirit.</p>
<p>Finally, this may be a special situation in the elementary school in this alley. During every break between classes, the school's affiliated store opens all four doors, and the pastries and such pique the children's appetite. As a result, they run home asking for "pocket money." This not only cultivates their bad habit of eating snacks but also distracts them from their studies. I hope that such "special situations" (there are many "special situations" in alley elementary schools) will be improved if they exist, or strengthened if they don't, starting this semester.</p>
<h3>Seamstress of the Poor</h3>
<p>— Zhong Lin</p>
<p>This is a group of people forgotten by society, also forgotten by any women's movement groups. However, their development is flourishing and growing like a surging tide, while also facing a more tragic fate than most.</p>
<p>One winter afternoon, the cold wind was biting, no longer able to be warded off by a light jacket. It was the time when silk shops were holding so-called grand sales, also the time when wealthy people were planning to buy new winter clothes. I rummaged through my worn-out luggage for a thin cotton robe, and engaged in the silk... of the cold winter.</p>
<p>The cotton robe had been chewed by mice in several places, with the grayish-white cotton wadding exposed. Should I get a new one? I didn't have the money, so I had no choice but to give a Jiangbei seamstress of the poor a piece of business.</p>
<p>She bent her head, sewing for me, as I stood by her side, leaning against the wall. Cars sped by on the road, people coming and going, showing great activity. I aimlessly watched groups of women in overcoats passing by me. Comparing them to the woman mending my clothes, I instinctively felt a sense of emotion. Thus, we had the following conversation:</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Jiangbei, the countryside of Taixing."</p>
<p>"How many years have you been in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, let me see, more than thirty years."</p>
<p>"Have you been doing this all along?"</p>
<p>"No, I first worked with my father, then I got married and sometimes did some work. After that, my husband died, and I've been a seamstress of the poor for ten years."</p>
<p>"Do you have any family at home?"</p>
<p>"My mother-in-law is over seventy years old, sick and unable to move. My nineteen-year-old daughter works in a silk factory, making five or six dimes a day to take care of her own food and lodging. Sir, you know: rice, vegetables, housing, daily necessities, nothing is cheap! It's hard enough just to fill the stomachs of the three of us."</p>
<p>"Then how much money can you make in a day?"</p>
<p>"It's really pitiful. Thread is expensive, needles are expensive, and there are so many people doing this. Making twenty cents a day is already good business."</p>
<p>"Are there many people doing this too?"</p>
<p>"A lot! I haven't counted carefully, but there must be at least one or two thousand. When you're young, you can go to a factory, but as you get older, the factories don't want you anymore. If you want to live, you have to find a way. Besides being a seamstress of the poor, what other way is there? It's been especially busy lately. Many factories have closed since the war. Young women have also taken this path. It'll only get less when someone dies, otherwise it'll only keep increasing."</p>
<p>"This is a serious social problem. Where do the old female workers go?"</p>
<p>"Luckily, we don't have many people in our family. Two out of the three of us earn money. I know some families where seven or eight people, old and young, rely on one person's seamstress of the poor money to survive. They can barely afford a bowl of thin porridge a day."</p>
<p>"They can't go back to their hometown. There's no land to farm, and people keep coming every year. People from the countryside see Shanghai as a place to get rich. It's easy to come, but impossible to go back."</p>
<p>She talked on and on, and a picture seemed to appear before my eyes: fields destroyed, families helping the old and carrying the young, fleeing on the path to their ideals. The result is wandering, hunger, death, destruction! All tragic words can be applied to them. Of course, the one or two thousand people she spoke of are certainly more than that number in Shanghai. Without work, they turn to being a seamstress of the poor, but when they can't sew anymore, where do they go?</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: World Transportation, Universal Language; Childhood Education, Awards for Talent</p>
<p>Shao Huihua said: There are trains at six o'clock and seven o'clock tomorrow morning. School starts at nine o'clock, so there's plenty of time. This wasn't a lie. It only takes two hours on the express train from Shanghai to Suzhou. But Wu Junke said, "The early train is too rushed. I'd rather take the night train. The night trains in Shanghai, whether the eleven o'clock train or the twelve o'clock train, are both fine. However, the twelve o'clock train arrives in Suzhou at one o'clock, which is a bit too late." So she decided on the eleven o'clock train. Since Sister Tan Yun's house is very close to the West Railway Station, they could board the train at the West Railway Station. Both the eleven o'clock and twelve o'clock trains go to Nanjing. However, the eleven o'clock train doesn't have sleeper cars. Several cities and towns along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have become prosperous recently, and the train stops along the way for passengers to get on and off, so it's a bit slower than the twelve o'clock train. The twelve o'clock train is almost all sleeper cars, with only three or four non-sleeper cars. This train goes straight to the Jinpu Railway after crossing the river in Nanjing. After midnight, passenger trains leaving Shanghai are temporarily suspended until six o'clock the next morning. During this time, it's all about freight trains, because the goods produced along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway are all transported on the Shanghai-Nanjing trains. At that time, the six young ladies squeezed into a car and drove to Jin Tan Yun's house. Sure enough, there were already people there to greet them, these were several relatives and elders of Tan Yun's, who had already returned from the International Hotel. Knowing that there would definitely be people coming to the house for the wedding banquet, the electric lights were on inside and out, and many sweets and refreshments were prepared to treat the guests. However, when the six young ladies arrived, the other guests hadn't arrived yet, it was truly as Shao Huihua said, "first come, first served." But in less than ten minutes, the guests began to arrive one after another. Among the guests, especially the female Western guests, they all wanted to admire the bridal chamber of the Chinese newlyweds, to see if there was anything special about it. In fact, Lin Jiancheng and Jin Tan Yun, the newly married couple, were already Westernized. Even the furnishings and decorations in their new room were all in the Western style. The only slight difference was that upon entering the new room, it was a sea of red. For example, their carpet was dark red, the curtains were light red, the vases were filled with red flowers, red beads hung on the electric lights, and especially the bed was piled high with brocade quilts and embroidered blankets, although they were colorful, with a large red one embroidered with mandarin ducks playing in the water placed on top. This was all arranged for her by one of Jin Tan Yun's aunts, the old ladies were still a bit conservative, because red has always been used for auspicious ceremonies in China, which is a bit different from Western customs, where white is used for auspicious ceremonies!

<h3>Record of Shang Xiaoyun Becoming a Disciple</h3>
<p>— Yan Wu</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun, one of the Four Great Dan Actors, once became a disciple of the late famous Hua Dan, Tian Guifeng, around the years 1924 or 1925. Later, the two of them differed greatly in their views, leading them to go their separate ways. The reason for this was that Tian was poor and Shang was arrogant. Initially, after becoming famous, Shang was not satisfied with being ranked third among the Four Great Dan Actors. Because of Tian's reputation, he planned to become his disciple. So his accompanist Zhao Si acted as an intermediary, and they set a date to hold the apprenticeship ceremony at Tongxing Hall outside Zhengyangmen in the old capital. After Zhao Si conveyed Shang's intentions to Tian, he thought that Tian was in a difficult situation and would readily agree. However, Tian gave a vague answer. After Zhao Si repeatedly inquired, Tian finally replied that he would consider it for a few days. The reason was that Tian suffered from poverty, and his wife was even more greedy. The reason why he didn't dare to agree immediately was that he hadn't obtained his wife's consent. Moreover, because Shang was a contemporary famous actor, he had to extort him greatly. After Tian discussed it with his wife, he went to Zhao Si to inform him of all the conditions he had proposed. The most important one was that the minimum amount of the apprenticeship gift must be forty yuan, and the monthly salary must be one hundred and fifty yuan. It must be sent monthly and not be in arrears. Zhao Si immediately agreed. So they set a date and gathered at Tongxing Hall to hold the apprenticeship ceremony. On that day, many people from inside and outside the industry went to watch the ceremony. Shang immediately performed a three-kowtow ceremony to Tian in public. Then, he took out a sealed red envelope from his sleeve and handed it over respectfully. Tian accepted it happily. Afterwards, everyone enjoyed themselves and dispersed. After Tian returned home, he eagerly opened the envelope to look at it. Unexpectedly, there were only two foreign dollars inside. Tian thought that Shang's betrayal was Zhao Si's fault. He planned to go to Zhao immediately to negotiate with him. Later, his wife persuaded him to stop. His wife thought that the student only gave a gift to the teacher once during the apprenticeship ceremony, so the loss was limited. He should wait until the end of the month when the tuition was sent to see if it was in accordance with the agreement, and then decide what to do. When Shang went to Tian's residence to learn his craft, Tian didn't mention a word about Shang's failure to fulfill the conditions. He only asked what opera he wanted to learn. Shang then asked to revise the performance of his "Xi Feng" ("Playing Phoenix"), while Shang would take care of the "dialogue" and "singing" himself, without Tian's intervention. Tian thought that since Shang's "Xi Feng" had been revised by Tian, then all the "singing," "acting," and "dialogue" in the whole play should be performed according to Tian's revisions. Therefore, he firmly opposed Shang's request. He immediately began to revise the Four Ping Tune lyrics that Li Fengjie sang for the first time when she appeared on stage in the play. Shang listened to it and didn't think much of it. The reason was that all the famous Dan actors now used the "Ren Chen Rhyme," with a total of six sentences, and the last word of each sentence was: "Zhen," "Yin," "Yun," "Ren," "Ding," and "Men." Tian's was completely different from this. Although it also sang six sentences, it used the "Jiang Yang Rhyme." The words were: "Since childhood, I grew up in the beautiful Longzhen, with my brother and sister opening a shop. My brother, he once told me, he said, there is a merchant in the front shop. Put the tea on the table, Li Fengjie still returns to the embroidery room." Shang said that Tian's lyrics were not popular (the opera term for not being popular) and ignored them, still singing his "Ren Chen Rhyme" lyrics. This was something Tian couldn't do anything about. Later, he taught her the body language of Fengjie when she left the stage in the first scene. When ordinary Dan actors perform this, they raise the towel high above their heads with both hands. At the same time, with a quick movement, they quickly turn to face Zhengde and then run off the stage. Tian's performance of this was completely different from the above. He first tricked the towel into his hand and then draped it on his right wrist. Then he smiled at Zhengde and ran into the backstage door with small steps. (Tian once said to me that Li Fengjie in this play must be played by someone who is familiar with the art of the maiden, because Li Fengjie is a girl who has not left her boudoir and has her own identity as a maiden. How can she use the body language that is often used by today's Dan actors that is very similar to the flying kick of a martial arts student to show that she is a maiden?) Shang thought that Tian's acting was too gentle. Although Tian tried to explain it to her many times, he couldn't get the point and gave up. This was something Tian couldn't do anything about either. Tian still tried his best to endure under these circumstances, hoping to get the salary of one hundred and fifty yuan. But the relationship between teacher and student had already cracked, and it was bound to be impossible to stay together for long. Sure enough, Shang only went to Tian's residence five times before disappearing. At first, Tian thought that Shang didn't come because he was either sick or had been detained by something. Later, he found out that Shang was practicing his voice and practicing his skills at home during the day, and then going to the Jixiangyuan Theater in Dong'an Market to perform in the evening. At this point, Tian realized that Shang had decided to abandon the conditions. So he went to the backstage of Jixiangyuan that night to look for Zhao Si to negotiate. Tian first asked him why he didn't fulfill the conditions. Zhao Si then dodged the question and gave no definite answer. Tian thought that Zhao Si was so insincere that he ridiculed him again and again. Zhao also retorted. The two went from arguing to almost fighting. Later, after someone mediated, Shang gave Tian fifty yuan as a gift, and the two sides severed ties. This was the result of Tian's first time accepting a disciple. Very few outsiders knew about this inside story, but I heard it from Tian himself.</p>
<h3>Strange News of Misplaying (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The backstage penalty rules of the Erhuang troupe have a clause for temporarily misplaying the role. Although it is not as strict as the military law for desertion in battle, the penalty is still to deduct the actor's pay or burn incense in front of the statue of the patron saint to warn them. Misplaying the role means failing to go on stage when one is supposed to. "Temporary" means that the reason was not stated beforehand, so no one could replace the actor. If the actor is already in costume backstage and misplays the role, the offense is lighter. If the actor does not even arrive backstage and misplays the role, the offense is more serious. If the lead actor fails to arrive on time, it is called misplaying the entire play, which is an even greater offense. In military terms, this is like a general failing to move his troops, delaying the war and harming the country, which should be severely punished. In the last twenty years, actors' pay has increased, and their status has risen. Good actors are as rare as phoenix feathers or unicorn horns. Heaven does not often create them, and people rarely see them. The backstage tolerates good actors, and the penalty rules have gradually collapsed and become irreparable, like the warlords in the Tang Dynasty who were tyrannical and unruly, whose power was too great to control. The imperial court's orders were not followed, and this was the result of accumulated power.</p>
<p>The best at misplaying roles was Jin Shaoshan, who played the Overlord in "Farewell My Concubine." He misplayed roles every time, as if it were a routine matter.</p>
<p>I will now describe the suffering I personally endured from the Southern Overlord's misplaying of roles: In the spring of 1929, a certain school in Nanjing was raising funds for a charity performance. I was in charge of the arrangements and also managed the backstage. In addition to the amateur opera group from Shanghai and Ningbo, there were also actors such as Jin Shaoshan. Fearing that he would misplay the role, I prepared two cars for him in advance: one to rush him to the performance, and one to urge him. I urged him again and again, but he still did not arrive. I even drove myself to urge him, almost growing wings on my sides, my heart burning with anxiety. I saw him playing the short flute and wearing light furs and a loose belt, his composure worthy of being called invincible. But at this time, a small play and a "Ma Hou" (a term for delaying time) were being performed on stage, and the audience was restless. Anyone with any sense of responsibility would be anxious to die!</p>
<p>A Glimpse into the World of Movie Fans</p>
<h3>Discussion of New Programs at Second-Run Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Wang Yiming</p>
<p>It has been almost a year since the four second-run movie theaters in the city implemented the "rotating program" system. Generally speaking, this system is designed to save the audience's transportation costs, as any movie can be seen at a nearby theater. At the same time, the burden on the theaters can also be reduced a bit. However, for general movie fans, watching the same movies for four weeks is really not satisfying.</p>
<p>This time, they have changed another batch of programs. This time's programs have two differences from before:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, good movies were always shown on Sundays. This time, the movies on Sundays, except for "Eternal Love," are not particularly exciting. On the contrary, the movies on Fridays and Saturdays are very good. This is of course because the first day of the Lunar New Year is a Thursday, not a Sunday. Regarding this point, I hope that the four theaters will premiere Friday's movie one day earlier on the first day of the Lunar New Year, that is, show it for three consecutive days: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. This will allow the audience to not be restricted by the "rotating program" during the New Year's program and go to see the movies they don't like.</p>
<p>(2) Although these four theaters inherited the movies of the four major first-run theaters, the second-run movies of MGM always belonged to Huguang (but the four theaters also showed "My Fair Lady" and one or two other movies). However, it is said that Huguang will only show domestic movies from this year onwards, so this time, the MGM movies in the four theaters' "rotating program" include "Springtime in the Rockies," "Song of the Islands," and "Night Must Fall." Speaking of this, I remember many excellent MGM movies such as "Mrs. Miniver," "Boys Town," and "Born to Dance" that were not shown because Huguang did not have enough time to allocate. I hope that the four theaters will try their best to schedule these movies.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the four theaters will continue to schedule programs that are more satisfying to movie fans in the future based on one year of experience in selecting movies, and I hope that "Magnificent Obsession" will be released early.</p>

<h3>News from the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>The Yixing Amateur Drama Society's production of "Di Si Niang," which has been rehearsing for more than a month, has been decided to be performed day and night for two days starting on February 3 at the Tiangong Theater on Yuqiaqing Road, co-directed by Wang Xianzhai and Ge Ge.

(4) The famous Dan actor Furongcao, when she was in the old capital in her early years, obtained a secret formula for palace powder精製 from the former Qing Dynasty's imperial court. She has now given it to her friends Guo Mingxue and Xue Kunzhong, who have raised funds to form a Furong Chemical Company to use the secret formula to produce a wonderful product for winter beauty that is a must-have for young ladies, named Furong Face. One thousand bottles have been made in advance and entrusted to the Huangjin Grand Theater for sale.</p>
