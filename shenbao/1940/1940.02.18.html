<p>一九四〇年雖然不是一九一四年，但戰爭的分野却並沒有多大的差別，號稱民治國家的英法站在一方面，納粹的德國站在另一方面。美國通過新中立法而保持其所謂中立，同樣是民主黨執政；同樣是一位光明磊落克孚衆望的總統在任秉政；國內民衆的輿情及執政者的態度，同樣是傾向於民治國家方面；而對納粹主義表示極端憎恨，也與上决大戰爭中對德國軍國主義的僧恨一樣，更其火上加油的，是美國執政者痛恨站在納粹背後《主義雖不同而手段却相同的穌聯。蘇聯的大舉進兵芬蘭，足為其露骨的表示。羅斯福總統會痛斥以武力為解決國際爭端的手段，近更譴責蘇聯為獨裁國家，與其仙獨裁國家無別。美國的動作可謂己劍拔弩張，更進一步將是什麼？現在固然還不能加以斷定，但目前的局勢，却已急輕直下，由混沌而趨向明顯了。我們可以從幾方面去觀察，第一美國是資本主義的重鎭，無論在經濟資源上，軍火供應上，都占着首屈一指的地位；它的一舉一動，都足以影饗全世界，而這决世界戰爭的特質，是長期戰爭，是在經濟上爭雄長，而不是在戰爭上決勝負，本國資源的調整，與他國資源的供給，都占着同樣重要的地位。英法兩國今日不能輕輕放棄美國的接濟，正如美國軍火工業不能缺少歐洲市塲一樣。美國新中立法的實施，有利於西歐國家，也同樣有利於美國軍火商人，在這一點上，英法與美無形中有了一種利害一致的聯繫。美國雖揭着中立的旗號，口稱不願干涉歐洲的事件，但由於客觀環境上的需要，及英法背後的牽制，美國對於歐洲事件〈自不能隔岸觀火完全置身局外。第二歐洲現在爭執的焦點〈不在波蘭的恢復，更不在納粹主義的傾覆，却集中於波羅的海的芬蘭。西歐民治國家，移其視綫於芬蘭，美國也移其視綫於芬蘭，西歐民治國家移其痛惡納粹的情緒於蘇聯，美國也移其痛惡納粹的情緒於蘇聯，步伐相同，如出一轍。美國副國務卿韋爾士這决游歐，據倫敦方面傳出消息，是志在與倫敦巴黎羅馬柏林當局交換意見，以冀造成一集團，阻止蘇聯向歐西的發展，證之美國國內發生要求與蘇聯斷絕外交關係的言論，蛛絲馬跡，顯然可尋。再由另一方面觀之，英王頒佈命令，准許英國臣民為志願兵投入芬蘭軍中作戰，以及美國參議院通過借款供給芬蘭，其他北歐諸國的志願兵紛紛赴芬蘭前線助戰，反蘇的陣線即使沒有大規模的進行，至少已一步一步地逐漸走近。第三自二次大戰爆發日起，直到現在，英法方面始終沒有放棄壓迫德國做反蘇先鋒的企圖，除了幾决海戰及德國的潛艇活動而外，西線的戰事，只限於宣傳戰，飛機戰，斥堠隊戰，及雙方壕塹內的砲戰，而始終沒有大規模的接觸，這是為德國留一與英法妥協迴鋒以向蘇聯的餘地。不久以前，英法方面，宣傳德國將在西線大規模進攻，而到了最近，又宣傳德國的速戰速決，已成過去，這不是他們的自相矛盾，而是另有作用。這作用的具體說明，可拿路透社所傳出羅斯福總統派遣韋爾士赴歐的目的來作佐證：「羅斯福總統對於德國時局真相，殆獲有特種情報，深知該國在經濟上政治上已陷於絕境，誠恐國社黨當局挺而走險，致使該國乃至整個歐洲遭遇浩刧，因此主張及早恢復和平。」如果這幾句話的眞實性，有幾分可靠的話，那末挽救德國國社黨挺而走險的意義，當然是不使它變為「赤化」之謂，那結論必然是恢復歐洲的和平的方法，只有谷國站在一條陣綫共同對蘇而已。現在反蘇的暗潮，正在醞釀中，當然具體的結合，自尚有待。不過蘇德新經濟協定的締結，已證明英法的計劃，根本沒有實現的可能，而蘇聯日來在芬蘭加里利亞的地峽，加緊進攻，不惜任何犧牲，也就是答覆英法方面謀以芬蘭問題號召各國結成反蘇戰綫計劃的一種策略。一九四〇年雖不是一九一四年，而美國具有左右大局的能力，却仍與上决戰爭一樣，所以今後一切將視美國採取何種外交路綫，而決定戰爭的趨向，這是毫無疑問的。</p>

<h3>金市恍惚　潛勢尚堅</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、中途仍頗恍惚、大致先漲後跌、惟結果尚吿上漲、潛勢堅定、蓋人心猶在望高、至半天情况、初以匯市續趨緊軟、買氣仍濃、於金號等競購之下、初開一跳四十二元為四千八百八十元、繼則再漲三十元達四千九百十元高峯、後以匯市經匯豐維持後而轉硬、證券帮首肯賣出、一般散戶亦跟之脫售、價遂退至四千八百六十元、旋為港帮突來搜購、加之證券帮反出為進、遂再升達四千九百零五元、嗣因外匯回硬、某銀號及錢兌業等力塞、雖證券帮復來撈入、一度盤小至四千八頁三十元、及至午刻、某銀號轉賣為買、錢兌業亦來拖進、故午收為四千八百六十元、結果較隔昨晚收軋漲二十二元、但比上日最後價無甚榮辱、午後塲內無正式行市、而稍有暗盤成交、半天成交暢旺、約三千五百兩光景、銀樓飾金先漲後回、終則平平、海關金等仍吿呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤漲念二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外匯扳緊、買者仍擁、某金號與銀樓帮等爭先放盤收買、三十分買進某錢兌業為四千八百八十元作開盤價、較之前收抬起四十二元、少頃買風仍盛、再漲三十元金號進錢兌業五十兩、為四千九百十元、嗣因外滙忽報回硬、頓起賣風、證券帮首來力售、錢兌業散戶等亦跟賣、繼後遂回小五十元、銀樓帮出錢兌業二十兩、為四千八百六十元、旋因英錢兌業突代港帮搜入、加之證努帮亦反出為進、遂重再漲起四十五元、錢兌業進金號五十兩、為四千九百零五元、其時客帮中止吸收、且外匯續報回鬆、某銀號及錢兌業互相競塞、遂復回跌六十五元、某錢兌業售予銀樓帮三十兩、為四千八百四十元、第因證券帮復來撈入、遂又抬至四千八百七十元、奈因某銀號及金號再賣、且斯時外匯已報回平、遂再降小四十元、某銀號出錢兌業四十兩、為四千八百三十元、午刻某銀號反出為進、同時錢兌業亦來拖進、遂拉起三十五元、某銀號進錢兌業五千兩、為四千八百六十五元、繼而金號錢兌業售予證券帮五十兩、為四千八百六十元作午收價、結果比上日晚收軋漲二十二元、收後一度又撳至四千八百四十元、後經某金號撈入、復回至四千八百六十元、半天八十元上洛、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金先高後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百九十元、迨至九時三刻、掛高五元、十時四十分回小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行仍懸四百九十元、新同行與上相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣仍形緊張</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊、需要續殷、市價堅挺、英美金票、大戶傾納未已、市况緊張未弛、美金票晨初漲達十四元七角八分、嗣後供給稍暢、市價微鬆、午時英金票為五十三元七角五分、美金票為十四元五角九分、午後供求稀少、變動狹隘、晚市英金票為五十三元六角、美金票為十四元六角、較上日續見昂貴、香港票供給未暢、荷蘭票羅比票需要微增、市價堅俏、日金票需要甚盛、市價續升、晚市為一元三角三分、朝鮮票因津滬匯水下跌、市價虛弱、晚市為元零四分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升一元、英金票荷蘭票羅比票、俱升一角、美金票升八分、香港票升四分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價大漲　昨始小跌</h3>
<p>昨日米市漲風已殺、乃以金市回落、及市價一轟太足之故、一般作客不免難以下手、致銷塲頓呆、晨間一無交易、若本鄉店舖實胃悉在觀望不進、售方際此欲謀脫貨、不得不甩價相邀、一時跌風頓起、若西貢等洋米價一路直瀉一元五角有奇、經此一番跌風、方見作客漸漸出手、然納意終覺不暢、市面後無變化、有謂米價漲勢過兇、操縱太辣、完全置市政當局禁令於不顧、威信不行、市民怨望、未免使人難堪、故於麵粉已公然出而仍照十元廠盤維持民食、米糧方面亦將有新辦法發表、顧全大衆生活、昨日米店中自覺如此高價、頗為心虛、多有全日上板門、運小竇亦行閉塞、因之升斗小民、見此景象更深惶慮、反足以增加恐慌、如此自擾擾人、有維持地方治安之責者、亟應令其照常營業、以安人心、吾則反足以引起搶米風潮、</p>
<p>昨日收盤、一號西貢為五十一元至五十元零七角、二號西貢為四十八元三角五分、火絞米四十九元半至四十九元、東市砶尖四十六元三角、四十六元、混合碎高目四十元，决至三十八元、小紋四十七元半、大紋四十四五元、白元無論國洋兩貨、悉亦空空、計開香港白元四十八元、决至四十七元、溧陽白元四十八元、丹陽四十六七元、國米厚薄粳暗盤之風、雖仍水殺、然以洋米見跌、聞亦難以壟斷、無所榮辱、</p>
<p>洋米昨市漲風已挫、因來源既湧、平糶又定二十三開辦、當局亦將有嚴厲檢舉之表示、且搶米風潮又有發生、故行囤舖作納胃均懈、執貨者不再扳持、一號西貢開價即小至五十一元、繼開五十元零五角至五十元、比之前日小去元半、其他各米統小六七角至一元不等、惟收市因價低銷活、又傳站局、新交易因週末無市、回籠小絞暹羅均五十七元、二號西貢五十六元八角至五十六元二角半、計有三百多噸、</p>
<h3>維持麵食　將見諸公開</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨市漲風稍見平和、蓋自紅盤以來、廠盤雖未增加、而回籠粉漲之又漲、漫無止境、昨因米油市價回鬆、及當局壓平物價、將取斷然手段、聞廠方已接受工部局勸吿於下星期（二月十九日）開始增加供給本街批購、每家由五十包增至一百包、並由租界當局派捕維持秩序、限定各店零售老車牌粉每包一律十元零三角、一面暗派幹事員密查、嚴厲處置以杜操縱行為、故人心略見平復、惟回籠貨依然深居鮮出、綠砲車仍有十六元之高盤、兵船牌與市砲車十五元八角、老車棧單十五元五角、成交的計五千包、聞日廠粉鳳凰牌開至十五元後、昨又加漲二三角、所有回籠粉居奇抬價、若得工部局調查加以警吿、勒令平價分批供給市銷、必於民食有益、</p>
<p>小麥　昨漲風尤熾、蘇州麥經前日開至二十七元之後、貨方居奇逾恒、市塲中竟無出樣、華粉廠以定有洋麥、並無辦意、某粉廠及味精廠等尚在放價吸收、故昨又抬漲半元、蘇州小麥價達二十七元五角之新高峯、統市成交二三車、聞華廠方面、亦有蘇常麥一批正在談價、大局形勢、晚市稍挫、</p>
<h3>油餅　油價稍殺</h3>
<p>昨日生油及豆油之漲風、在晨初仍緊張、入後、因金價轉鬆、二則叫天內暴漲二十元左右、實銷不免减色、因之市氣稍殺、操縱乏力、致大局立定、市價無　出入、統市共祇做開靑岐豆油一百件、價為九十元、大速豆油一百五十桶、價為一百二十三元、漢口桶豆油二十桶、價為一百二十元、靑島花生油十桶、價為一百二十五元、膠州路貨花生油二百件、價為九十五元、江北决桶生油十五桶、價為一百十七元、查豆油十七日由天津來三千三百十聽、又豆餅十八日運香港二千塊、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃荳外強中乾</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市價繼續向上銳進、各豆行情、較上日市再漲八角一元不等、計開蕪湖豆三百包、價為二十八元五角至二十九元五角、靑島豆一百包、價為三十三元五角、丁家州豆千餘包、價自二十八元五角至二十九元八角、及浦東杜豆五十包、價為一十八元七角、崇明沙黃一千五百餘包、價自二十八元五角至二十九元一角、但照市塲中交易之態、囤戶雖熱烈、然實銷漸弛、故其潛勢或許在此運漲一週之情形下、轉盤旋之局亦不為奇云、</p>
<p>又豆子十八日有五千五百十四包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球零售　超過議價</h3>
<p>煤球廠應儘量供給　母使奸商操縱市面</p>
<p>煤球行情、現雖由公會竭力維持、平定廠盤、但用戶防荒心切大批購藏、而煤球廠停止出單、催出老貨、以致本街供求頓感不均暗盤迭見俏俐、昨日市上、義泰興、南洋煤球棧單、已抬高至一百三十二元、尚無躉批手貨、而門莊店因需要關係、不得不飲鴆止渴、以維營業、故零售價參差不齊、每担售七元</p>
<p>角及七元不等、已超出公會定價、甚望煤球廠能儘量供給正式店家、統一售價、勿使奸商操縱、搗亂市面、實為社會之福</p>
<h3>證券證券　債市仍堅</h3>
<p>證券　盤、昨日市况復父稍稍轉堅、大戶多頭始終不動、尚有零星加碼、茲聞時局無論如何變化、公債本息決無問題、是以多方愈覺膽壯、目下行市之不起漲風、完全受外匯短縮金子在漲之威脅、且資本家去而之他、故暫時有冷落無神狀况、實則風馬牛不相及、前途仍富樂觀、昨日初開、在大康成聯和等賣氣之下、小盤開價、繼因信孚聯益同順等從事收買、乃冉冉回上、結果仍回好一角至三角、成交數的四十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、在交天廚味精廠股三十股、價爲八十元現鈔、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、因係本屆長期交易過程後之最後關帳日、浮多了結者、大吿擁擠、結果價格稍有跌落、但所有被迫賣出之股、尚有吸收、是種現象之見於橡皮股、中營股暨業廣股者、尤爲明顯、於此有例外者數種、價格不得反漲、如國際會德豐及電車等股、且各以二十四元七五·九十三元半·及五十六元半之新高價收盤、</p>
<p>倫敦十六日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平穩、上下檔各債券、概無上落、</p>
<p>倫敦十六日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、稍見上升、保安保險股漲一鎊、為二十七　半、匯豐銀行香港註冊股升半鎊、為八十七鎊半、其餘吿平、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市漲風已定　市盤一高出籠紛起</h3>
<p>紗市兔起鶻落、趨勢疲中帶硬、金融界及一般殷富者、收藏之貨、非但不出、遇低落時仍來收進、惟檯面上搶帽子者時進時出、異常紛繁、故市價上下更大、杳近日之市面、狂升狂降之原因、　自紅盤以來三天飛騰百元左右、目前引起獲利者、乘機出籠、所以一漲即鬆不過大戶拖進之貨、尚不肯放鬆也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、聞黃金開盤又漲、匯票續縮、買氣狂熾、二十支雙馬開價爲八百七　五元、纼日跳起二十五元、詎料此價一開、拋賣者接踵而來、市盤即疾退、頃刻跌去一二十元、中途雖有盤旋、然仍屬平疲、結果雙馬回小至八百四十六元收盤、查半日間成交統計二千一百零五包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、棉紗今日有一百五十五件運港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、九六〇　香港　三〇</p>
<p>內地　三五　統計　二、一〇五</p>
<h3>通州花　出二百元關</h3>
<p>本棉交易異常起色、同行中心思挺秀、故買氣濃烈、廠方亦有發展之象、不過棉價自紅盤開始以來、直上靑雲、已漲二十元、較紗價昂貴殊巨、而紗市雖漲、已見回下四十元、兩相比較棉市太貴也、然存底不厚、所以執貨者、安如泰山、通州花已漲破二百元關外、為二百零三元高價、蘇北來源到通花一千三百六十九包、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<p>浙東棉花、政府實行統制後、已不見運滬、於月初由本市美商恒達洋行、在浙採購姚花九千餘包、裝太古公司黃浦輸運滬、已誌前報、今悉該行採購之第二批、計一萬零二百三十八包、仍裝太古公司黃浦輸、已於前日（十六日）到埠、現正起卸中、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日晨初先因購買者頗衆、故市况尚稱堅定、後因同業購買、及空頭抵補者之活躍、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起六七磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦跌五便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨又靜寂廠方購意始終淡薄、同業之購意亦不若前數日之熱烈、日方廠商未聞有大量之交易做開、日來到貨甚多、俱係解抵廠額、昨日滙兌無甚軒輊、茲以美滙六元八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支美米特林　二五九·〇</p>
<p>二十支美米特林下級二五〇·〇〇</p>
<p>三二支美米特林　二七三·〇〇</p>

<p>黑鐵坯子　春盤後即見十分活躍、唯自兩日來外滙緊縮、廠家採辦减弱、刻市行情如二千磅原捆沽人百六七十元、二百磅每箱售八十二三元、比前各好起二三十元及二三元不等、</p>

<p>本釘　本廠兀釘因建築帮及客戶等均有進意、氣象頓形熱鬧、行情冉昂二三元、查刻市父需五十二元一箱倍司矣、</p>
<h3>海味　生粉底存單薄</h3>

<p>平糶地點共四十處</p>
<p>上海平糶委員會議決自二月二十三日起、委託米號業同業公會會員、辦理第二期平糶後、每人限購一元、每元為五斤半、業經該會主席虞洽卿與米號業公會主席張念萱商妥、並經米號業同業公會通過接受辦理、新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、聞兩租界共設平糶處四十處、對公共租界二十四處、法租界十六處、每處指定一家米號擔任售票、一家米號擔任發米、時間為下午一時至六時、每處糶米每日暫定五十包、以糶完為止、平糶時之秩序、由租界當局警務處派捕維持、平糶處地點正由米號公會分配、一俟決定後、即行公佈、俾衆週知、至於平糶委員會第二次向西貢訂購之碎米一萬一千包、業已抵滬、暫上銀行堆棧、前向上海市塲上購進之現貨約有三萬四千包、亦堆在棧房內、</p>
<p>虹口搶米米店打烊</p>
<p>洋米價格突破五十元大關後、國米市塲、因工部局限價關係、形成有市無貨、另售米、售價竟超越限價十餘元、故市民深盼當局對於米店、嚴厲執行限價、平民為迫於生計、前日虹口發生搶米潮、全市米店、恐遭波及、昨晨起又告打烊、僅開一小窗洞交易、各米店旣恐搶米打烊後、又恐平民沿途搶取米車、故對整擔送貨、暫時中止、而購進亦暫停、致各米去胃呆滯、米市塲開市後、因僅有售客、而各買客多數又係期貨、故各項售價隨之回跌一元許、此則足證　戶居積、已遭反動、</p>
<h3>制止物價騰貴　惟採峻法嚴刑　有關當局應卽行動</h3>
<p>宇林報載讀者來函云、吾人所食、無不仰給於本市乘機居奇牟利之食物商、余發此言、深信公衆咸具此意、本地新鮮產物緣何騰貴至如此地步、實無眞正現由、兩租界為民之長者、應成立食物委員會、以遏止葷素食物商之食婪無厭、此其時突、一都市如上海、而有工部局中幹練行政人員、足以自豪者、竟忽視此事、實屬可恥、余有敢於言者、如委派興特女士料理此事、則渠當有更佳之服務成績、處置乘機牟利者、唯有一法、非重處罰鍰、即處徒刑、或吊銷營業執照是、立即採取嚴峻行動、事須有關當局為之、否則、乘機牟利之徒將信彼等均可橫行無忌、繼續抬高食物價格、</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏發表談話</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨日往訪本埠商界領袖虞洽卿氏、承虞氏延見、並發表談話如下、虞氏謂、本埠食米恐慌情形、已非一日、為維持平民生計起見、各業領袖與各界熱心人士、似不就</p>
<p>袖手旁觀本人曾發起民食調節協會、剏議　團購米、以期開源、一面復聯合熱心人士、剏設平糶委員會、日來米價益趨嚴重、平糶委員會業經集議、決定自本月二十三日起、委託本市米號業公會會員米號、繼續辦理、惟碎米價格日漲、大有後繼為難勢、日後如外匯及水脚續增、虧損當益鉅、欲平糶之繼續辦理、非由各界各業</p>
<p>踴躍認繳捐款不可、蓋人民本有互助天職、救人即所以救己、人心旣安、各業方可發展、至為明顯、至煤炭邇來煤價飛漲、影響平民生計至鉅、而日常需用之煤球、價格同時遞高、前途危險堪虞、查由國外運滬之煤、或因受外匯及水脚關係、雖免隨漲、而一般國內煤斤、如開　煤等、該局發售價格、並未大量增加、而外間竟亦視同印度煤等、逐步遞增、似乎</p>
<p>不甚相宜鄙人心所為危、難安緘默、爰已分函煤業及煤球廠業兩公會諸君、請其從速會同設法制止、虞氏又謂、際此米煤飛漲、生活日高、一般薪水階級、自覺難以勉度、鄙人曾接得各業夥友、及各捕房華捕等、紛紛來函、要求主持公道、增加津貼、現在工部局方面、對華捕業有此建議、當有相當辦法、各業方面、希望顧全雇員生活、自動酌加津貼、以資維持、</p>
<h3>浦東沿浦開放區　拘束萬狀　日海軍「防區」內　居住仍須市民證</h3>
<p>浦東沿浦一帶、日本海軍陸戰隊駐防地區、於十五日開放後、沿海之警戒綫、亦宣告取消、據記者調查、由公共租界與法租界兩處乘船渡赴浦東者、僅在海軍區域之東昌路其昌棧兩渡口、無「市民證」可以登陸、但須受身體之檢查、仍感不甚自由、至於南黃浦之南碼頭周家渡兩渡口、及北黃浦之高　東溝高橋三渡口、係屬陸軍駐防區域、無市民證仍須强被扣留、故沿浦邊開放者、僅佔十分之三弱、且在開放之海軍區域內居住、仍須請領「市民證」、受無限拘束、</p>

<h3>滇越車已通行　本月十五日起正式通車</h3>
<p>滇越鐵路中國斷距河口八十二公里之白寨站附近、於本月一日、又遭日機轟炸、按該站迤北附近約二百碼左右、有巨大橋樑一座、橋前通入一山洞、此次轟炸、所投炸彈、幸未投及橋樑、惟有數彈適中山洞進口處、是時適有客車避入山洞中、車上乘客、被石塊及彈片擊中或死或傷者、約有八十餘人、該山洞洞頂石塊、亦受震動下墜、以致山洞整個封閉、修理頗感困難、最近海防來電、據云、該段毀壞地段、已修理告峻、河口至昆明間之普通車、已於本月十五日起正式通車、至於海防至老街間這一段（即越段）、普通及特別車仍照原定時刻行駛、現旣華越二段均可通行、對於行旅、實稱便不少、</p>

<h3>煤球難買原因　囤積二萬餘噸　七煤球廠棧存卽有此數　現正催速出貨以杜囤風</h3>
<p>上海市第一特區市民聯合會、昨分函義泰興·國華·越東·南洋·光華·精華·東方·七煤球廠云、逕啟者、閱報載貴廠等催告煤球出貨公告稱、「查敝廠等絡續簽發棧單、截至二月十四日止、未見到廠出貨者、共計尚有二萬餘噸、至敝廠等現有存煤、祗够供應棧單提貨、自即日起、棧單　律止發外、敬請各客戶速將煤球棧單到廠繳付棧租、即日出貨、實為至禱、」等語、此為有人囤積牟利之顯明例證、本會對貴廠等顧念民生、催告出貨、並停止續發棧單、深為佩慰、茲以煤價飛騰、民生恐慌、已迫嚴重關頭、對此輩祗團私利贈罔恤民艱之徒、自應予以較嚴重之表示、為特函請貴廠等嚴限存棧客戶、於指定日期如數出淸、逾期即依照成本平價發售、而退還其已付之貨款、以杜囤風、而延市民殘喘、無任企禱之至、</p>
<h3>從死傷比率證明　中國必獲勝利　中日軍死傷陣亡百分率　華軍喪折數字小於日本</h3>
<p>可堪注意之數字研究　　宇林</p>
<p>報載署名「歷史研究者」之讀者來函云、余頃　裘林亞諾特所著小册題名「中國之命運與美國之前途」、茲摘錄其中關於中國戰事、截至一月一日（未知是否指一九四〇年）為止之約略統計於下、</p>
<p>在華登陸之日軍　一，三〇〇·〇〇人</p>
<p>日軍死傷者　六〇〇·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>日軍陣亡者　二五〇·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>戰地中國政府軍隊　三，五〇〇·〇〇人</p>
<p>華軍死傷者　一，五〇〇·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>華軍陣亡者　六〇〇·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>以另一方式計之、結果如下、</p>
<p>日軍百分比　華軍百分比</p>
<p>戰地軍隊總數之死傷百分率　四六　四三</p>
<p>戰地軍隊總數之陣亡百分率　一九　一七</p>
<p>此前日本能從海外尤其為美國獲取戰具、故日軍在配備上、遠勝華軍、但以百分率為根據、則日軍所受喪折、已較華軍為大、茲者至少美國已在道德上禁止以在華作戰之具、供給日本、則日軍在配備上優勢、將逐漸减退、就物質言、中日兩軍終將在更平等之條件上作戰、而華軍祇須保持邇來之作戰精神、直至其在為力　所佔絕大優勢、使日軍受更大之喪折百分率、其結果將令日方努力、完全崩潰、據　推斷、此乃最殘酷之消滅戰爭、但上述數字之重大意義、應公　中國一般國民、庶彼　可知祇須屹立堅持、必得最後勝利、</p>
<h3>磚瓦船帶米　遭日扣押</h3>
<p>日偽禁止米糧運入租界、不稍懈怠、故各小船在內地帶來少數之白米、或自備吃米略多、一經發覺、必遭沒收並處重大之罰金、過去上述問題迭出、一般船家已不敢再予多帶、昨日下午四時半許、法租界外灘天文台碼頭南首、停有磚瓦船一隻、傤重約一千担、所裝磚瓦業已卸淸、聞該　由內地購米數包被不良者得悉、遂報告楊家渡「水巡隊」、當派來小輪一隻、懸掛五色旗、有四日水兵、即躍上磚瓦船、該船家事前已知被人告發、業將米搬上岸、日水兵上船搜查、已一無所獲、船夫已逃避登陸、該四日水兵即擬將船拖去、惟因該船所拋之鐵練錨、無法拔起、鐵絲纜亦不能解除、乃將錨練鋸斷鐵絲纜亦用刀斬去、將船及一小舳舨拖去、至江心又來一隻小輪、遂二輪分二面挾持、正擬南駛、忽有駐水上　店之日本水上憲兵隊、亦得報派一小輪趕來、欲將該船拖去、懸掛五色旗之二小輪不肯退讓、雙方商論後、水上憲兵隊之小輪駛開、一小輪即挾持磚瓦船、急往南駛、聞係拖往楊家渡「水巡隊」、該船家遭遇凌虐矣、</p>
<h3>國人發明　兩用電話機　經濟部准予專利</h3>
<p>上海國際電話製造廠沈增法、近發明牆桌兩用電話機一種、　呈請經濟部、由獎勵工業技術審查委員會審查決定、准予專利三年、查該項座用電話機、機壳內聽筒座架與名牌、可以互換位置、又聽筒座架下、有雙　彈簧、以備聽筒座架變易位置時、其中任一彈簧、可作開關之用、故牆式桌式、可以兩用、變易甚為便利、無須特種工具、對於電話公司、可以省却預備兩種電話材料之煩、在軍隊中、時常移動、有時作牆機、有時作桌機、更為方便、此項話機、由依巴德電器行經理、歡迎各界試騐參觀、</p>
<h3>救世軍　續得捐款</h3>
<p>救世軍募款總數、據該軍旅長莫利氏所揭示、已達到八萬二千餘元、昨日有華人慨捐一百元、美商某保險公司及其華人職員暨美籍職員、各有鉅款捐助、英商卜內門有限公司華籍同人、集體捐款達一百九十元、往年該軍捐款、常向私人個別募集、今年因事務紛繁、各軍官已未能再此方面策動、極盼熱心慈善人士、直接向該軍總部接洽、莫利氏又言渠對滬人士之慷慨捐輸、至為欽佩與銘感、</p>
<h3>捷僑籌款　滙送法前綫　處境極為艱困　募款殊屬不易</h3>
<p>旅滬少數捷克僑民、刻再度籌款、募得二萬六千法郎、滙往巴黎捷克紅十字會、轉送在英法前綫作戰之捷克軍士費用、不久以前、據悉香港捷克僑民、亦曾籌得　萬法郎運往前綫、救　捷克　戰隊兵、上海捷僑中、頗多在前綫馳驅、而家屬則仍留此間、本次募得款目、殊為不易、蓋捷克領事本人、刻遠在印度孟買、足徵捷僑之愛國熱忱矣、</p>

<h3>美新聞記者闡明　美國遠東政策　威脅美國利益絕不容許　對華貿易力求整齊發展</h3>
<p>中國乃世界現代文明的新前哨</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國著名新聞記者考斯坦洛、久居夏威夷、研究太平洋中美海軍政策有素、頃取道日本來滬游歷、昨（十六日）語記者稱、中國有偉大之前途、而美國擬增強其在太平洋之海軍力、俾確保其在中國之發展中、得居主要之協助地位、美海軍不欲對亞洲任何國家、促起戰爭、惟日本官員已往有一種趨勢、擬以對美作戰之可能性、驚嚇國民、</p>
<p>美對遠東確定政策</p>
<p>考氏追述若干年來美國對遠東之政策稱、一九二二年簽訂九國公約前、癥狀國未曾明示其對亞洲之態度、僅於各個問題發生時、加以應付而已、推源其故、半因兩半球間進行之貿易額、比較尙小之故、自一九二二年以還、美國　餘產物運來亞洲者日增、美國始有對遠東之確定政策、</p>
<p>太平洋上加強防務</p>
<p>美國增強其太平洋中海軍、僅在保障本身不因猝發事件而被擯出東方、美國之意、在使本身極有力量、而任何人威脅太平洋中美利益者、必有場惡戰、否則、不得加以威脅、美國對於應否在太平洋與大西洋各有一艦隊事、今有兩種意見、共折衷辦法、為加強美國之太平洋防務、而使與亞洲大陸儘可能密切連絡、</p>
<p>美國海軍未來趨勢</p>
<p>至於美國近所宣布改良瓜姆島成美海軍港、則早在去歲八月、已成必然之事、若菲島於一九四六年獨立、則瓜姆島對於海軍毫無價值、而美海軍將不得不使夏威夷成太平洋中最前防地、</p>
<p>日本前途未許樂觀</p>
<p>關於中日戰事、考氏聲稱、日本民眾在軍人統治下、益趨不安定、今已藉國會而表示其態度、日本若戰勝、其工業將其繁榮、但若戰敗、則有可怖的不景氣之可能、日本智識份子間今有一種日趨滋長的感覺、即若證明東三省與華北具有經濟上重要性、則應停止戰爭是、但日本若提出此種妥洽辦法、中政府必無停戰可能、</p>
<p>廢止商約關係甚鉅</p>
<p>美國廢止對日商約一舉、乃向日本指明日本所破壞之各種條件、並非廢紙而係神聖之文件、今美國一舉手即可截斷日本之生命線、即美國供給之煤油是、此點日本商人均知之、故竭力主張停戰、美國所求、乃在保障將來對華貿易之整齊發展、中國乃世界現代文明的新前哨云、考氏游滬後、將赴華北及東三省研究該地日人殖民狀況、秋季將入哈佛大學、攻政治經濟學、</p>

<h3>芬蘭的新戰術</h3>
<p>— 后</p>
<p>因得天時地利</p>
<p>故能以小敵大</p>
<p>俄軍襲取芬蘭，南北並進，初志本擬先定北路而後略取南路，卒以時迫寒季，北路無以立功，以是一月以上之相持，戰局重心在南部，而北方率為小戰。其間大不利於俄者，一則南北兩戰區相距之遠，竞達一千一百公里。欲其首尾相應，已屬至難，如盼一氣佔取，自非有至大之犧牲，恐難為力。其二為雪。南戰塲湖沒縱橫，號稱『萬湖國』之芬蘭，苟為禦外而興兵，湖水誠間有之天塹，今也入冬冰合，俄方之重砲車，原可大量過湖而倖免陷溺，而卒不能，則漫天大雪，復有以阻之也。其間積雪之日較短者，聞為偏在南部之芬蘭首都赫爾辛基，每年約計，有一百三十日不化之雪。若其北方拉普蘭之中央，則竟可有二百日不化之雪。又芬軍衣服軍輛色盡白，施諸雪地，極便掩藏。其三則苦於北極長夜之許久不見天光。芬蘭地居極北，南部之科日至短，只於數小時間陰沉籠罩之下，忽忽過去。北部北緯六十六度三十三分處為北極圈，其地每年三百六十五日間，已應有一永日不見白畫之長夜，若更北而深入北極圈，進至北緯七十度，則一年之內，將有六十一日不見白畫之長夜。俄軍黑夜作戰，特苦人地之生疎，如俄所力爭之貝柴摩港走廓地帶，介乎北緯六十八度與七十度之間者，今已成為不易措手之黑夜。其四曰寒。在北極圈以內，深夜冒雪而作戰，一切機械化之部隊，大抵失其效用，凡作戰者，苟非如芬蘭人之精於滑雪，直無以出奇制勝。寒地機器防油凍，而軍人雖被重裘，仍恐凍死。論者苟憑上述四點為衡斷，則俄之不得天時，誠其最顯著之一弱點也。</p>
<p>此外芬蘭人對地面戰爭之巧弄計謀，似亦有一述之價值。芬人善獵，身懷短鏢Kuku，（長及十五公分），敏於投刺，並能如北美洲紅種人，深入寂靜昏黑之森林而自尋出路，此為童子軍所擅長之運動競技，今以施諸北歐大雪漫天之長夜，本地人熟門熟路，誠最有利。彼俄兵之開入芬蘭者，則因懼入森林，多喜衝過冰合之湖，然湖面絕少蔭蔽，如在某地，多數俄兵一擁過湖之頃，突有芬蘭兵一人，挾機關槍而潛藏隱處，俟其近而連發四十五槍，一舉而斃四十一名之俄兵。此種戰法，以寡克衆，乃挾最新式機械，而輔以印地安人最老之成法者，洵創舉也。</p>
<h3>日本的旱荒　六十六年來未有的旱年　東京的飲水都成了問題</h3>
<p>— 蕙</p>
<p>日本去歲糧食欠收，大鬧米荒。入冬以後，北部則在風暴雪，作物大半摧毀。南部却久旱不雨，一連三四個月，有些地方，間直飲水都成了問題。隨着大早而來的是可怖的火災，上月十五日大火延燒了大半個靜岡市，損失財產達日金八千萬元，也就是因為靜岡四郊的水源均已涸竭，消防隊無法灌救的緣故。</p>
<p>這樣苦旱的情况，在日本是歷年來所未有的，無怪日本報紙上要用極哀痛的標題題着：「蒼天無情，賜日本以白魔（指風雪——記者按）與早魃」了</p>
<p>據一月三十日東京朝日新聞所載，日本自有氣象台以來六十六年，今年是第一個冬季常晴的年度，因此東京市內的水，在未來一兩月內將成為最嚴重的問題；五百數十萬的居民，不但要為飲水的來源擔憂，並且因為氣候枯燥，極易釀成火災；空氣濕度之不足，更易引起肺炎白喉一類的流行病。這樣看來，倘使最近期內再沒有大雨大雪，東京一帶的災禍將不堪設想了。</p>
<p>究竟日本今年苦早達到怎樣程度？我們最好用簡單的　字來表明。據朝日新聞記載：往年日本十二月份平均降雨量為六十糎，一月份雨量為五十糎；但這决冬季的十二月份却祗得了九·八糎的雨量，而一月份的雨量是零，因為根本沒有下過一滴雨。父據上月末日本氣象台全國氣候預測，至少在最近四，五天之內，東京附近絕對不會降雨，即使在五天之後，也委實渺茫得很呢！</p>
<p>東京市民一致盼望着：</p>
<p>「究竟到那一天才得降下一滴甘露？」</p>
<p>戰地一角</p>
<h3>烽火連天的蕭山</h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>據軍事家觀察，日軍佔據蕭山，並不進犯紹興，這是應用拿破崙所發明的「橋頭堡陣地」即兩軍融汪對峙，以一部兵力渡江往擾敵岸，構築工事，牽制其兵力。但據作者愚見，還有一個原因，就是杭州江干的山上，日軍裝設砲位，蕭山在其射程之內，當此錢江大橋未曾修復以前，機械化部隊不能源源過去，若不顧死活的深入，跑出大砲射程之外，就成為甕中之鼈了。</p>
<p>說起蕭山，實在不是軍事上必爭之地，前會多决被炸，已成焦土，這回又經拉鋸戰，當然是一無所有了。作者戰前二次到蕭山，會進中山公園，地位雖小，倒還幽雅，但現在想亦荒蕪不堪矣。</p>
<p>蕭山產楊梅，頗著名；惟地多毛厠，非掩鼻而過不可。當紹蕭公路（現已破　）未成以前，由滬轉杭發往浙東的貨物，俱由蕭山人搬運渡江，至西興下船，分載各處。</p>
<p>想來讀者未會忘記，十餘年前有位沈定一先生（字玄鷹）在該處從事農民運動，並因此被刺。他最喜吟下面的一首石灰詩；「千鎚萬鑿出深山，烈火轟燒若等開；碎骨粉身都不顧，祗留淸白在人間」。這首詩不但後死的蕭山人應當讀熟，　無論何人也都值得一記罷。</p>

<h3>鋁……現代工業必需原料</h3>
<p>鋼精展覽會具有教育重大意義</p>
<p>留心工業者應加注意</p>
<p>華鋁鋼精廠，假南京路大新公司四樓，舉辦鋼精展覽大會，於日前開幕，記者以鋁為現代工業必需原料，該廠此舉，於教育上既具有重大意義，對於工業發展，抑且有莫大關係，爰特驅車往覜，承該廠譚磊石君招待，並為說明，彌感興趣，茲就所見，概述如次，該會刻正繼續展覽，各界仕女，尤其是留心工業人士，亟宜早往參觀，俾可對於現代工業所必需之鋁，有更深切之認識。</p>
<p>記者咋往該會參觀時，甫出電梯，即覺銀色燦爛，光耀奪目，蓋該會門墻，即係以鋼精製成，宏偉壯麗，美觀之至，無怪為近代建業家所樂用，會塲四壁，懸有喜字壽字賀幛及對聯，驟觀之，疑為尋常綢製，而燁燁發光，絢爛非凡，及加諦視，始知亦即為鋼精所製，塲內除該廠所出各種尺寸厚薄之鋁片，如平片卷片圓片圓鋁箔等，悉有陳列外，餘如各種鋁製物品，及各種日用器皿，以至電氣用具，飛機材料等，無不分部陳列，秩序井然，塲中並有鋁片壓花機，及凹凸彩印機等數部，派有專員，當塲工作，出品由來賓傳觀，無不嘖嘖稱道，陳列品中，最爲引人注意者，厥爲主特汽車之機伯，公共汽車身與座椅各種著名牌號之一律採用鋁質包裝，飛機模型，及染色鋁製品等，而鋁之質輕力強，易於運用，永不銹蝕，以及富延展性等等特性，亦即由此種種出品充分證明之，至於各種圖表，尤皆明確詳盡，使觀衆對於鉅之功用與特性，均可一望而知，鋁之用途綦廣，其犖犖大者，如運輪業，軍用品，家用品，包裝業，食品業，化學業，紡織業，電氣業，印刷業以及建築裝飾等，均惟盡量利用鋁製品，方能减輕成本，而達經久耐用之目的云。</p>

<h3>藝術界的物物交換</h3>
<p>— 堯</p>
<p>物物交換（Barter)，本是古時幣制還未存在前的貨物流通的方法。以後社會進化，人們就以錢幣為媒介物，而這種最初的以物易物制度就小復存於世了。不圖此項制度現在竟遺留於藝術界中。</p>
<p>新近在巴黎，有價值一〇〇·〇〇〇金圓的續畫，是不用絲毫的貨幣，而交換了的。他們所用的中間物是鞋，汽車，酒，甚至於外科的手術。</p>
<p>在凡爾賽門旁之展覽公園的牛棚式的建築物中，交換沙龍（Salou　des　Exchanges)舉行了二個月之久。現代派畫家Osterlind同Rtmey二人得了許多的新鞋足够每人二十年之用Rokline所得的帽也不少，對此問題簡直以後可以小必顧及了。SH．Morean　算最幸運，他得了部汽車。</p>
<p>其他來交換藝術作品的東西是：醫生全年充藝術家之醫學顧問，外科手術，中國珍貴的錦繡，以及人壽保險等等。有一個美國的畫家，Ary　Stillman，人家答應他以及他的朋友無論什麽時。到一個蒙脫馬脫（Montmartre)的咖啡店中可免費開飲含檳酒，可是他沒有接受這個貢獻。</p>

<h3>怎樣進修學來</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>學校開學了好幾天，小朋友們又開始過着快樂的團體生活，可是光陰是不留情的，一瞬眼就會溜到小考大考的時期，我們免得將來着急懊惱，從今天起開始用功吧！</p>
<p>在每月或學期考試後，成績報吿單往往帶來了不快和不滿，有些小朋友想我和那個同學不是　樣的用功嗎，為什麽他的成績反而比我好，或某人不見他讀書倒一科也沒有不及格，於是歸怨敎師偏心，郤不檢討因自己讀書不得法或急來抱佛脚（即在考試前臨時讀的）的緣故。所以我們如果不是為分數而求學，不是為敎師逼着才讀書，那麽要使我們的學業進步，成績優良，應注意以下三點：</p>
<p>一、準備：我們無論做什麼事都有準備，就是很小的螞蟻尚且在春夏秋三季，忙着準備冬天的糧食。所以求學也得有準備，譬如每上一課新書前先看一遍，在不懂的地方留個記號，以便發問，照這樣做後，在上課時，對於敎師所講的不致毫無頭緒了。</p>
<p>二、聽與問：在上課時，不和同學談話，不想別的事情，不看外景，對於敎師的講解，同學的疑問聽着想着，一些也不疏忽，遇有困難，不恥問，直問到明白才止．</p>
<p>三、溫習：在課後，抽出數小時分本做各門功課，不偷懶，不抄襲對於敎師未指定的課本，也要知其要點，牢牢的記住。</p>
<p>預先準備，使我們知道了一課新書的大概，聽和問解決了以前疑難，然後溫習，把它牢記在腦中，以後遇到考試，約略重溫，就能應付裕如·不會感覺到身體上和心理上的苦悶了。</p>
<p>小友朋們！你們如果希望這學期成績優良，趕快照着去做吧！</p>
<h3>降落傘</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友！你可知道這「降落傘」是個甚麼玩意兒嗎？也許諸位還不曉得吧！所以我就在這裏隨便談談。</p>
<p>「降落傘」是個什麽東西？它是救護飛行人員生命的。在飛機上遇到機器損壞時，飛行人員就可以從萬尺高空中，飄身落下，所以它那唯一的用途，就是能够救護生命，因此又叫做「安全傘」，或叫做「保險傘」，但是關於叫「傘」的原因，無非是它在空中作用時，形狀很像一把「傘」的緣故。它的確是航空界的利器，尤其在空戰的時候，萬一被對方將自己乘坐的飛機打中了某一部分，飛機一定要落下來，生命就有萬分的危險，如果飛機在半空中突然起火，那自己也必定要「葬身火窟」！現在有了「安全傘」以後，無論怎樣的危險，就用不到担憂了！至多降在敵陣作俘虜。</p>
<p>「降落傘」是西曆一四九五年法國人所發明的，他的名字叫做「純西」，當初他發明的動機，並不是用作空中保險的工具，而是專門用以由高處下降低處或高處落載輸送的物品，後來航空事業發達，就把它重視起來，當作唯一的空中救生工具了。我們應該知道，飛機一旦飛到了幾千尺以上，如果發動機停止了，了，電露線着火了，汽缸爆裂了，以及其他意外的發生障碍，在這樣生死關頭的一剎那，飛行人員便可以從容地躍下，平平安安降到地面，所以在雙方戰爭的時候，空軍方面的安全，是極關重要的，可以說「降落傘」就是救生「護符」了。諸位覺得奇怪嗎？為什麼用了「降落傘」就是在高空中落下，人也不會跌死？我告訴你，我們不會游泳的人，跌到水裏，便要下沉，但是有了「救命圈」，便會浮在水面上了。這是因為水有「浮力」的緣故。空氣是和水一樣有「浮力」的，所以飛機可以像船在水中前進那般的自由，飛行人員用了「降落傘」下來，也是因為空氣有「浮力」的緣故，使人慢慢地降到地面，自然人不會跌死了。假使你不相信的話，你可以用一張大的紙片，從樓窗上擲下來，你便可以看見那張紙片在空中東飄西盪，慢慢地落下地面，這樣就可以證明空氣是有「浮力」的了。所以你如果萬一家中不幸而起火了，那末，你便可以用一把洋傘，趕快張開，你拿了傘跳下樓來，生命就保全了、「降落傘」大的有五種：（一）座包式，（二）膝包式，（三）直背式，（四）曲背式，（五）快載式。「座包式」，傘，是它的傘包用如座墊，使飛行人員沒有負重的痛苦，在保險傘中，是最普通的一種；「膝包式」傘，是便於攝影師，觀察師，機槍師等使用，因為他們的膝前沒有機械的障碍：「直背式」傘，是專供乘坐汽球或飛船人員使用的，使負傘者有行動和攀援的自由；「曲背式」，它的傘包是沿人體背部的曲線而成特別背包形，適用於敞口坐艙的敞用飛機；「快載式」傘，是特別製定的，平時懸掛在飛機內，在發生危險時，取而戴之，手續很簡便的。</p>
<h3>怎樣防止玻杯的爆碎？</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>庸兒母親帶着他到親戚家去，回來時順便買了幾隻玻璃杯。</p>
<p>「哥哥，媽媽買了兩種美麗的玻璃杯回來，一種是厚的，另一種是薄的，而價錢是一樣的，我以為厚的合算，你以為怎樣？」庸兒一踏進屋子，便這樣的叫着宗兒。同時他母親拿了一壺沸水，先把水倒在厚的一隻裏，那知沸水還沒有倒了半杯，便聽得「刮」的一聲，玻杯上當然有一條裂紋了。更把水倒進薄的玻杯裏，却好好地一無動靜。一奇怪，厚的倒容易爆碎，哥哥，你可知道嗎？」庸兒看到了這出乎他意外的現象，便疑惑起來了。</p>
<p>「玻璃杯愈是厚，倒愈是容易爆碎。你要知道凡是物體受到了熱便要膨脹。這爆碎的原因，便是玻杯受到了熱，便不平勻的膨脹起來。你想沸水倒入厚玻璃杯中，那水不能立刻燙熱杯子的四壁，起初僅燙熱它的內層，它的外壁還沒有熱。內層受到了熱便立刻膨脹，但外壁却依然如舊，因此內層發出力向外壁衝擊，那杯子便爆碎了。薄玻璃杯能立即使全部燙熱，很快的消除內外溫度的不平均而達到全部的膨脹。你更瞧這隻玻杯的底也是薄的《吾則也容易爆碎的。假使你要防止厚玻杯的破裂也有辦法：當你把煮沸的水倒下厚玻璃杯時，事前把一柄銀製的茶匙放在杯裏，那杯子便可不致碎裂，這什麼道理？因為放了一柄銀匙後，那就使杯中沸水的熱傳遞開來，沸水變為不十分的沸了，也就是把杯中的溫度降低，杯子便不會碎了。我們如果用銅製的匙也可以，但沒有銀匙的好，因為銀匙比其他金屬品能更快的把熱傳開去，就因為銀是最好的導熱體，這也可試騐的，在沸水杯裏的銅匙是不會燙痛手指，而銀匙却是會的。」宗兒很詳細講給他弟弟聽希望他能澈底的了解。他說完了這一大篇話，還一一地試給他看，眞一些也不錯，因此在庸兒的腦海裏比較有了深刻的印象。</p>
<h3>奇怪的駱駝</h3>
<p>— 方銜</p>
<p>假使我們用手帕把鼻子蒙起來，不上幾分鐘便要覺得十分不舒服，因為我們呼吸不暢利了，可是被稱為沙漢之舟的駱駝却能自動地把鼻子關閉起來，至很久的時候。</p>
<p>我們留意去觀察萬物，眞有許多事物巧妙得不可思議的，好像駱駝，就是天生在茫茫無際的沙漠中載運貨物的工具，因為沙漠中常被大風捲起漫天的砂土，要是駱駝沒有一具這樣的鼻子，那來，砂粒準會從鼻子裏灌進它的肺管，你想，肺管裏能容得砂粒的存在嗎？不但如此，駱駝還有一個天賦的貯水袋，才能在沒有滴水的沙漠之海中，跋涉長途，猶如遠渡重洋的海船，必須裝足淡水，方能航行一般。</p>
<p>駱駝的貯水袋，其實並不成袋形，却是一個多孔體，說得逼眞一些，有點像塊海棉，因為它能吸收多量的水分。當駱駝未踏上征程這前，走到沼澤旁邊喝得飽飽地，袋子裏裝　滿了水，這樣，假使幾天遇不到一滴水，就有恃無恐了。</p>
<p>更有它的脚也是天造地設的，脚掌大得像一把蒲扇，要不然，便會埋沒到沙層裏去，不能在沙上行走了</p>
<p>這些都是牛馬驢騾沒有的特點，所以駱駝是天生的「沙漠之舟」。</p>
<h3>黑兄弟（六）</h3>
<p>— 一木</p>
<p>西南風先生果然實行他所說的話，自從他這回來過之後，從此不再降臨百寶谷了。尤其壞的，他不但自己不來，並且通知了他的親戚朋友，如西風他們，一齊絕跡不至。因此之故，一年到頭，山谷中一些兒雨水都沒有。下面的平原上雖是滿眼碧綠，到處都是豐收，而他們三兄弟們沒法兒挽回天心，只得很失望的拋下了他們這不値錢的產業，到平原上的城市中去另尋生路。他們的錢都已完了，只留下了幾件舊式的金碟子，這是他們最後剩餘的不義之財。</p>
<p>他們走進了大城，希華對漢士說道。「我們還是改行做金匠吧。透一門行業很可以做些手脚，欺騙人家；凡是你所做的金器裏頭，儘可把大量的黃銅夾雜在內，誰也瞧不出來的。」漢士聽了這話，也很以為然，於是他們租了一隻爐子，決定做金匠了。但他們開工之後，却並沒有多什麽錢，一則主顧們並不喜歡他們的夾銅金器，再則哥兒倆偶然賣掉了什麼東西後，就喚格勒看守着爐子，到司壁酒店裏去喝酒，把掙來的錢全都吃光了。</p>
<p>他們把所有的金子下爐熔完了之後，沒有錢再去買進，末後只剩了一隻喝酒的大金杯，是往　時他們的伯伯送給小格勒的，格檑雖並不喝酒，只在這杯子裏喝些水和牛乳，但他因爲是伯伯的紀念品，非常寶愛，無論如何，不願意和它分手的。瞧這杯子的模樣兒，很爲古怪的，那柄是兩個金絲髮般的圈兒打成的，打得十分精細，竟好像是眞的絲不像是金屬物了。這兩個金絲髮的圈兒運下去，就是髭鬚，也打得同樣的精細，圍繞着中央一張很兇狠似的小小的人臉，那質地是一種最紅的紅金，上面嵌着一對眼睛，分明是整個杯子的中心點。每當擎起杯子來喝水或喝酒的時候，免不了要對這一對灼灼有光的眼睛瞧一下子。希華却最怕這回事，因為有一次他喝完了酒，見這一對眼睛在向他　着呢。</p>
<p>哥兒倆見一切金子都已完了，就快意要把金杯回爐改做茶匙，這幾乎搗碎了格勒的心，因為這是他僅有的寳貝。可是他倆個哥哥兀自對他冷笑，伸手抓起杯子來向爐裏一丢，自管上酒店裏喝酒去了。可憐小格勒仍是照常看守着爐子，預備把金子改做條子的第一步手續。</p>
<p>哥兒倆去了之後，小格勒很傷心地對那鍋子裏的寳物瞧了最後的一眼，那兩圈的金絲髮都已鎔化了，只剩下一個紅鼻子和一對明亮的眼睛，比了平時更為可怕。格勒心中暗暗地想道：「這也難怪，我們這樣無情的對待它，它當然要怨恨了。」一面想。一面侷促不安的踱到窗前去，避開那爐子裏的熱氣，想吸收一些淸新凉快的夜氣。</p>

<h3>戰時的中國劇運</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>美國波士頓某報，最近刊出一篇重慶通訊，題目是「戰時的中國劇運」，記載中國內地的戲劇消息，特為摘述如下：自戰事發生後的兩年半中，中國各種戲劇團體相繼成立，數目的有一百個，目前，單重慶一地，倒有十三個很活動的劇團。此外，古典的，時代的劇本在過去的兩年中，也有驚人的成就。</p>
<p>從洪深那裏，我（原作者）知道：每一師軍隊中，都有一僩演劇團組織着。他們所以成立，一是貢獻給兵士們以一種娛樂的機會，其决就是鼓勵他們的勇氣與熱力，同時，又可以使他們得到許多戰事上的知識。除了這些團體之外，我叉看到：有無數所謂流動的戲劇團，被當局派出去，他們的任務，就是想補助前者的不足與缺點，使得沒有固定的劇團組織的地方，也可以有機會看到壯烈的英勇的然情的故事演出。他們的觀衆呢，當然要以兵士為最大多數，但一般民衆可也不少。</p>
<p>各劇團的演員，百分之五左右可以說都是過去很紅的電影明星，的有百分之四十都是往昔的業餘戲劇者，其餘的，也可以算是最大多數的，則大都遼是剛開始戲劇生活的年靑人。</p>
<p>開頭，所演的劇本都很簡單，他們的宗旨，就是在於喚起一般民衆與士兵們對於戰事的認識。「到了現在，」洪深先生對我說：「我們的收穫是挺驚人的，目前的劇本都較過去的要複雜，精細多多了……。</p>
<p>最近上演的，計有（一）三壯士，（二）渡越黃河，（三）狐羣狗黨等等。在這些劇本裏，無論是佈景，音響，道具，燈光，統統都優美極了，演出的成績當然都有着非常的成功。</p>
<p>中國教育的不普及，是無可否認的事實所以報章雜誌給與人們的影響，可以說是很小很少。我們該利用戲劇的力量，來灌輸各項知識，戲劇對於中國人的需要，於此當可見其一斑了。</p>
<h3>王獻齊「一門三傑」</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>路明陳鏗然徐琴芳是被稱爲電影界的「一門三傑」的，現在他們在香港為南粵公司拍戲，於是這「一門三傑」的字樣就在報章上冷落了；是為了那是用熟了的成語，在最近，「一門三傑」四個字很快的加到了王獻齋身上。</p>
<p>王獻齋去年從四川回上海的時候，同時帶來了一位新夫人，她是從前明星公司的同事袁竹如，本刊上會登過他們的訪問記，那末被稱為「一門三傑」的原因是不是袁竹如也有一位妹妹呢？不是！原來在「葛嫩娘」中演李十娘的沈浩，因為孽海花」排戲緊張，再要日夜演威實在是沒有工夫了，所以李十娘的位置另外我了一位小姐，那位小姐名字叫王薇，會經在靑年會演過「狄四娘」等戲。這次請來上李十娘，大家都很滿意，尤其是一西太后「編劇魏如晦十分賞識，並且有請演「西太后」中的珍妃的意思。</p>
<p>王薇的名字雖然是生疏得很，但是在璣宮後台，她已經是一位很熟的演員了，原來她就是王獻齊的大女兒，恰巧王獻齊袁竹如都在「葛嫩娘」中客串鄭芝龍與田氏，於是「一門三傑」道四個字便加到了王獻齊身上。（上面是王薇小姐的狄四娘劇照）</p>

<h3>木偶奇遇記</h3>
<p>— 伊凡摘譯</p>
<p>頑童們的末日</p>
<p>有一天，匹諾丘和燈心划着一只小船在檸檬河中盪漾着。燈心提議到香烟路上去我些新刺激，於是他們便棄舟登陸。那裏地上滿長着香烟和火柴，籬笆是雪茄烟。燈心毫不在意地取了一校雪茄，吸着，還慫恿匹諾丘挑大的吸。正在這時，吉密耐蟋蟀來了。看見匹諾丘吸着烟，他多悲傷啊！因此大聲喊道：「我竟不知你下流到這般地步哪－－給我回家去吧。」</p>
<p>燈心很奇怪，問本偶這是什麽東西。匹諾丘漫不經意地看了蟋蟀一眼道：「他是我的「良心」。「你意聽這麼小虫的話麽？一燈心回身便走，一邊還道，「我不和你在一起了」。小木偶抱怨了吉密耐幾聲，便回頭趕上去，口裏嚷着「等一等，燈心！我來了！」</p>
<p>現在只剩下氣惱的吉密耐蟋蟀一個兒了。仙賭咒不再管木偶，於是同身向埠頭行去。可是今天眞奇怪，黑暗的快樂島上陰森森的找不到個孩子。他們都到那兒去了呢？行近埠頭，才駭得一跳。小蟋蟀見那裏聚着許多驢子，有的足上還穿着孩子們的鞋呢！旁邊兇狠的車夫和肩着槍的衛兵在來回巡視着，一邊還不斷地鞭打着可憐的驢子。原來這就是快樂島上的黑幕，那些驢子便是這羣懶惰的頑童的下塲。忠心的小蟋蟀急忙部香烟路奔去，他要去救匹諾丘。</p>
<p>天啊，太晚了！木偶的頭上已長出一對毛茸茸的長耳，後面還拖着條驢子的尾巴。這時看見了吉密耐也無暇說話，隨着便逃。警鈴響了，探照燈四面射着，警犬衛兵和車夫都在後面追着這幾個逃犯。可憐的燈心（現在他己變了一頭小驢子）被捉住了。木偶和吉密耐却僥倖地得跳入海中，他們得救了。（七）</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Celebration by Chongqing Citizens: Chinese Army in Guinan Pushes to the Outskirts of Nanning; Japanese Troops in Nanning Retreating to Qinzhou; Chinese Army in Eastern Zhejiang Recaptures Anchang and Approaches the Suburbs of Xiaoshan City</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, at a music concert tonight, responded to audience requests and gave a brief report on the current Sino-Japanese military situation via radio broadcast. He stated that the Japanese army is now rapidly retreating towards Nanning, and the closest Chinese troops are only ten miles away. Mr. He estimated that a thousand Japanese trucks are carrying Japanese troops from Nanning to Qinzhou, and Chinese troops along the highway are ambushing these Japanese troops. Mr. He continued to report on the situation in Suiyuan, saying that the Chinese army has now advanced to the outskirts of Wuyuan. Mr. He concluded, "The military situation has indeed turned in favor of China, and our victory is assured." Mr. He was wearing a Western suit today and was in high spirits. All sectors of the Chinese community here are eagerly awaiting further good news from the Nanning front. (Reuter's dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese Minister of Military Affairs General He Yingqin announced in a radio broadcast today that Chinese troops are already at the gates of Nanning. The Japanese army, using over a thousand trucks, has retreated along the Yongqin Highway towards the coast. In the past 48 hours, the Chinese army has launched fierce attacks on the retreating Japanese troops and their trucks on the Yongning Highway with unparalleled bravery. The Japanese troops are now retreating towards Longmen, where they originally landed. As for the Japanese troops in Wuyuan, their rear has been completely cut off, so they can be annihilated soon. In short, the failure of the Japanese offensive in Guangxi and western Suiyuan has completely proven that final victory will belong to China. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, the news of the Chinese army's great victory in Nanning spread throughout Chongqing. Shops immediately set off firecrackers to celebrate "the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning." However, the Central News Agency, which has correspondents stationed with various Chinese military organizations and on the front lines in Guilin, and which has wireless radio stations, has not yet been able to confirm this news. According to usually reliable Chinese sources, since February 15th, when the Japanese army began to retreat southward towards the coast in large numbers, Nanning has been ablaze for two days. It is estimated that 18,000 Japanese troops have withdrawn from Nanning. The initial report of the Chinese army's victory in Nanning arrived here this morning from Guangxi provincial transportation authorities, stating that the Japanese army set fire to villages northeast and north of Nanning along the highways. The Japanese troops on the Yongbin and Yongwu Highways are now retreating, and the Japanese troops in Nanning are also retreating towards Qinzhou along the coast. Currently, there are no traces of Japanese troops within ten miles of Nanning, so the vanguard of the Chinese army has reached the vicinity of Sitang, northeast of Nanning. Chinese official agencies here say they are now awaiting further detailed reports from the Guangxi battlefield headquarters. It is reported that the Japanese troops north and northeast of Nanning have indeed retreated towards Nanning, and there have been significant troop movements in Nanning as well. However, it is still difficult to say whether the Japanese troops have already retreated to Qinzhou or are preparing for new military operations in Guinan. (Reuter's dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to the latest news obtained by Ta Kung Pao today, the Japanese troops in Nanning have retreated southward, and the Chinese army has re-entered the city of Nanning. It is said that the Chinese army is now launching fierce attacks on the retreating Japanese troops, resulting in extremely heavy Japanese casualties. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It is widely rumored here that the Japanese army in Nanning has begun to retreat. The people have been setting off firecrackers from morning to noon, in a state of extreme excitement. It is said that yesterday Chinese aircraft flew over Nanning and saw the entire city ablaze. It is heard that the Japanese army has been burning Nanning since the 15th, but the fire has not subsided slightly even today. This is clearly an indication of destroying various military facilities and engaging in retreat. The Chinese army surrounding Nanning has now planned to encircle Nanning on all four sides. The outer perimeter of the Japanese army is now guarded at Sitang, northeast of Nanning, on the Binyang Highway. According to the Ta Kung Pao news here, there are now 17 Japanese warships and several transport ships, all busy transporting wounded soldiers onto the Japanese warships and transporting away military trucks obtained in the Nanning area. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Since the Japanese army in Guinan was completely defeated by the Chinese army in the vast mountainous area from Binyang and Shanglin to the southern suburbs of Wuming from the 9th to the 13th, the Japanese army has presented an irreparable defeat. Their morale disappeared, and their formations were chaotic. They collapsed towards Nanning. The various Chinese armies took advantage of this momentum and fiercely pursued and annihilated them. By the evening of the 14th, the key points north of Sitang on the Yongbin Road and north of Dagaofeng Pass on the Yongwu Road had all fallen into Chinese hands. The remnant Japanese troops in the mountainous area of the northern suburbs of Nanning were also being intensified by the Chinese army. The Chinese army on both sides of the Yongqin Road also simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the rear of the Japanese army, cutting off their transportation and intercepting newly arrived reinforcements. For days, fierce battles have been fought along the highway. By the morning of the 17th, Nanning, which the Japanese regarded as a strategic point and would never give up, fell under the close control of the Chinese army. Since the 15th, the suburbs of Nanning have been in great chaos. On the 16th, Japanese soldiers were setting fires everywhere and the flames soared. They also robbed and killed civilians, causing many elderly, weak, and young Chinese civilians to be harmed. The various Chinese armies are now bravely advancing to save the people from the fire, vowing to annihilate these brutal Japanese in one fell swoop. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>

There were traces of war everywhere in the city and the mountains. The broken walls of houses all had gun holes dug in them. Japanese corpses were scattered inside and outside the city and had begun to smell. The Chinese side has buried them one by one. The Japanese abandoned countless weapons, ammunition, and other items, all of which were seized by the Chinese army and are now being transported to the rear by trucks. In addition, the military rice previously stored by the Chinese in the city is still intact, which proves that the Chinese army pursued quickly and did not give the Japanese time to transport it away or burn it. (Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Binyang: After their disastrous defeat in Guinan, the Japanese army burned, killed, and looted along the way, showing extreme brutality.

The Chinese army is comforting the people and burying the Japanese corpses on one hand, and continuing to pursue closely on the other. The Japanese officials in Nanning were unable to maintain order and were unable to accommodate the defeated soldiers. On the 14th and 15th, the Japanese officials fled to Qinzhou in panic.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States in the World's Conflicts</h3>
<p>Although 1940 is not 1914, the division of the war is not much different. The Allied countries of Britain and France, who claim to be democratic states, are on one side, and Nazi Germany is on the other. The United States maintains its so-called neutrality by passing new neutrality legislation. The Democratic Party is in power, and there is also a transparent and popular president. The public opinion of the people and the attitude of the rulers are also inclined to the side of the democratic countries. The extreme hatred of Nazism is the same as the hatred of German militarism in the previous great war, which adds fuel to the fire. What is more, the US government hates the Soviet Union, which has the same means as Nazism behind it, although the ideology is different. The Soviet Union's large-scale invasion of Finland is a naked expression of this. President Roosevelt has denounced the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes, and recently condemned the Soviet Union as a dictatorship, no different from the dictatorial countries. The actions of the United States can be described as tense, and what will happen next? It is impossible to determine now, but the current situation is becoming more and more obvious. We can observe from several aspects. First, the United States is a stronghold of capitalism, occupying a leading position in terms of economic resources and arms supply. Its every move is enough to influence the whole world, and the nature of this world war is a long-term war, a competition in economics, not a decisive victory in war. The adjustment of domestic resources and the supply of foreign resources are equally important. Britain and France cannot easily give up US assistance today, just as the US arms industry cannot lack the European market. The implementation of the US new neutrality law is beneficial to Western European countries, and also beneficial to US arms merchants. In this regard, Britain, France, and the United States have an invisible link of common interests. Although the United States is holding the banner of neutrality, claiming that it does not want to interfere in European affairs, due to the needs of the objective environment and the constraints behind Britain and France, the United States cannot be completely uninvolved in European affairs. Second, the focus of the current disputes in Europe is not on the restoration of Poland, and even less on the overthrow of Nazism, but on Finland in the Baltic Sea. Western European democratic countries are shifting their attention to Finland, and the United States is also shifting its attention to Finland. Western European democratic countries are shifting their aversion to Nazism to the Soviet Union, and the United States is also shifting its aversion to Nazism to the Soviet Union. The steps are the same. US Undersecretary of State Welles's tour of Europe, according to news from London, is aimed at exchanging opinions with the authorities in London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin in the hope of creating a group to prevent the Soviet Union from developing towards Western Europe, which is evidenced by the remarks in the United States calling for the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Looking at it from another aspect, the King of England issued an order allowing British subjects to join the Finnish army as volunteers, and the US Senate passed a loan to supply Finland. Volunteers from other Nordic countries have flocked to the Finnish front to help fight. Even if the anti-Soviet front is not being carried out on a large scale, it is at least gradually approaching step by step. Third, since the outbreak of World War II, Britain and France have never given up their attempt to force Germany to be the vanguard against the Soviet Union. Apart from a few naval battles and German submarine activities, the fighting on the Western Front has been limited to propaganda warfare, aircraft warfare, scouting warfare, and artillery warfare in the trenches on both sides, without large-scale contact, which is to leave Germany with room for compromise with Britain and France and to turn to the Soviet Union. Not long ago, Britain and France publicized that Germany would launch a large-scale offensive on the Western Front, but recently they have publicized that Germany's blitzkrieg has become a thing of the past. This is not their self-contradiction, but another effect. A concrete explanation of this effect can be taken from the purpose of President Roosevelt's dispatch of Welles to Europe as reported by Reuters: "President Roosevelt has obtained special information about the truth of the situation in Germany and knows that the country is in a desperate situation economically and politically. Fearing that the National Socialist Party authorities will take risks, causing the country and even the whole of Europe to encounter a catastrophe, he therefore advocates restoring peace as soon as possible." If the truthfulness of these words is somewhat reliable, then the meaning of saving the German National Socialist Party from taking risks is certainly to prevent it from becoming "red", and the conclusion must be that the only way to restore peace in Europe is for all countries to stand on one front together against the Soviet Union. The anti-Soviet undercurrent is brewing, and of course the specific combination still remains to be seen. However, the conclusion of the new Soviet-German economic agreement has proved that the plans of Britain and France have not been realized at all, and the Soviet Union's stepped-up offensive in Karelia in Finland in recent days, at any cost, is a strategy to answer the plans of Britain and France to call on countries to form an anti-Soviet front over the Finnish issue. Although 1940 is not 1914, the United States has the ability to influence the overall situation, which is still the same as the previous war. Therefore, there is no doubt that everything in the future will depend on what kind of diplomatic route the United States takes to determine the trend of the war.</p>
<h3>The US House of Representatives Passes an Unprecedented Naval Budget; The Proposal to Improve Port Facilities on Guam is Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Washington: The House of Representatives recently discussed the naval operating budget for the next year. A Congressman introduced an amendment opposing the improvement of dock and air station facilities on Guam. After a lengthy debate, the House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 123 to 114. The budget was immediately passed by a show of hands, totaling $966,772,878. This is the largest naval budget in peacetime. According to general discussions, the House of Representatives' passage of the bill by a show of hands shows that there were very few opponents, because according to the rules of procedure, if Congressmen disagree with the results of the vote by a show of hands, they can immediately request a roll call vote and re-vote. In addition, the House of Representatives will soon submit to discussion the $655 million naval expansion bill proposed by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Vinson. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Washington: The United States House of Representatives yesterday passed an unprecedented naval budget of US$995,772,878 to build dozens of warships and twelve strategically important naval bases. The House of Representatives voted 223 to 114 to abolish the proposal to develop the port on Guam (1,500 miles south of Yokohama, Japan). The reason for the abolition of the proposal is that the development of Guam to suit naval needs may increase the risk of the United States getting involved in the conflict in the Far East. However, observers point out that Guam has recently been included in the 14th Naval District, and the development of Guam's port has already been carried out. The required funds are allocated from the development of the 14th Naval District. Therefore, the House of Representatives' abolition of the proposal to develop Guam's port will not affect the Navy's plan to develop Guam as a base for aircraft and submarines.

<p>Washington - Republican Committee Chairman Hamilton led a presidential election campaign against the Democratic Party yesterday and delivered a speech, stating that the American people have suffered under President Roosevelt's New Deal propaganda and political fatalism for seven years, resulting in a society riddled with problems, increased unemployment, commercial depression, and farmers suffering from hunger and cold. The current US government must be led by responsible individuals to avoid a national bankruptcy crisis. Hamilton's speech was full of attacks on the Democratic Party and the New Deal, and he expressed optimism about the Republican Party's victory, given the "deterioration of Democratic Party discipline."

<h3>Opening of Yangtze River and US-Japan Relations Reported by Arita in House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Tokyo - All morning newspapers here carried Foreign Minister Arita's remarks in the House of Representatives yesterday afternoon regarding the opening of the Yangtze River and US-Japan relations. Arita told the House of Representatives that there should not be too much optimism about US-Japan relations. The opening of the Yangtze River will be based on Japan's rights and will not be a condition for negotiation. The opening date has not yet been decided, due to the military's fixed policy. The opening of the Yangtze River must be decided based on the military strategy and the maintenance of peace and order. The morning newspapers did not criticize Lieutenant General Yanagawa, Secretary of the Asia Development Board, who said in the House of Representatives that "after the final establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime, the Japanese army must guide the regime in military, political, and economic matters for some time." (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun, a Japanese army organ, stated that former Foreign Minister Nomura used the promise of opening the Yangtze River as a tool for diplomatic negotiation during his negotiations with the United States on December 18. Therefore, the current Foreign Minister Arita's attitude is attracting attention from various quarters. Some say that the opening of the Yangtze River will cause economic chaos because legal tender will flood in. Others say that the war in the Yangtze River region is still ongoing. Some local Japanese authorities believe that removing restrictions on Yangtze River shipping is not as easy as initially expected, given the current state of naval and land military affairs, politics, and the economy. Therefore, it is believed that there is no possibility of opening the Yangtze River for the time being and that it may be feasible to do so in conjunction with the establishment of a "New Central Government."

<h3>Japan's Government Expenses for Last Year Increased Approximately Fourfold Compared to 1937</h3>

<h3>Diet Members Sympathize with Saito; Government's Strong Attitude Makes Disciplinary Measures Difficult to Decide</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Saito Takao, a leading member of the House of Representatives who strongly criticized the recent declaration in the plenary session of the House of Representatives on February 2, may be expelled from the Diet. Many members of various parties have voiced support for Saito and suggested that the punishment should be limited to a short-term suspension of Saito's attendance in the Diet. However, the Japanese government and the army have taken a very firm stance, and there seems to be no other option than to expel Saito from the Diet. The initial reaction of the government, the army, and the political parties in the House of Representatives was to demand Saito's dismissal, but the sentiment in favor of Saito in the House of Representatives has gradually gained strength, believing that members should be able to speak freely in the Diet in accordance with the constitution and should not be severely punished. Although Saito has voluntarily withdrawn from the Minseito party, many members of the Minseito party, the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai party, and the Social Masses Party sympathize with Saito. According to several previous indicators, the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai party and others have a strong anti-Saito attitude, but the majority of the members of the House of Representatives Disciplinary Committee will decide to suspend Saito's attendance for a few days instead of expelling him. Unexpectedly, the government has remained firm, and a certain cabinet member even said that if the House of Representatives decides to leniently punish Saito, the cabinet will request the Emperor to temporarily adjourn the Diet. After receiving this news, the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai party and the Minseito party now feel that the only way to resolve the dispute is to expel Saito from the Diet.

<h3>Japanese Diet Member Proposes Killing All Dogs and Cats Nationwide to Save Food; Hata Shunroku Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Kita Ryokichi, a member of the Minseito party in the House of Representatives, proposed to the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that the government should slaughter all dogs and cats (excluding those for military use) in the country to save food. He stated that each dog consumes one koku of rice per year, and there are one million dogs and cats in Japan. If they are slaughtered, one million koku of rice can be saved each year. At the time, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Shimada was not present, so General Hata, the Minister of the Army, replied on his behalf, saying that if Kita Ryokichi's proposal were implemented, all those who loved dogs and cats would be worried, so he dared not say how valuable the proposal was. General Hata has two strong hunting dogs at home that he cherishes very much, so his reply was probably sincere. The authorities at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also expressed opposition to Kita Ryokichi's proposal because they feared that thieves would become active after the dogs were slaughtered, and that rats would multiply after the cats were slaughtered, making it impossible to stop them.

<h3>US Commercial Crisis: Gold Surplus</h3>

<h3>Pinghan Railway Traffic Interrupted</h3>
<p>Beiping - Regarding the damage to a railway bridge south of Baoding, which has resulted in the recent interruption of traffic on the Pinghan Railway, a Japanese spokesman denied yesterday that this was caused by activities of Chinese guerrillas. It was claimed that the damage to a bridge was caused by the use of excessively heavy locomotives on the line. According to local news, traffic on the Pinghan Railway has been interrupted since February 6th, with trains only running from Beiping to Baoding. It is rumored that this was caused by activities of Chinese guerrillas. It is reported that railway traffic south of Baoding has been restored. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>British Warship Enters Norwegian Territorial Waters; Searches a German Auxiliary Ship; Rescues a Large Number of British Prisoners Aboard; German Crew Resisted Fiercely Before the Search</h3>
<p>Oslo - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued an official statement stating, "The German ship 'Altmark' sailed through our territorial waters on the afternoon of the 16th of this month and was immediately monitored by our torpedo boats. At 6:30 PM, several British destroyers arrived and fired warning shots at the ship, intending to intercept it. The captain of our torpedo boat immediately protested. The German ship then sailed into Jøssingfjord." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty recently issued a communiqué stating that the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" sank seven British ships in the South Atlantic last December (before it was scuttled on the Uruguayan waters) and detained the crew members on board, treating them relatively well. However, the sailors were detained separately on the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" (which was equipped with several cannons, but they were not visible), where they were subjected to abuse. The matter was revealed only when several sailors were transferred to the "Graf Spee." However, after the "Graf Spee" scuttled itself, the "Altmark" disappeared without a trace. It was not until the 15th of this month that news was received that the ship was sailing back to Germany in Norwegian territorial waters. Several British warships and aircraft immediately set out to search for it and finally found it in Jøssingfjord, Norway, yesterday. At that time, the "Altmark" was trying to avoid the bay. Two British destroyers, "Cossack" and "Intrepid", were ordered by the Admiralty to enter Norwegian territorial waters to intercept it and inspect it to ensure the freedom of the detained British sailors. However, two Norwegian gunboats appeared at the entrance of Jøssingfjord. The British warship captain proposed to the captains of the Norwegian gunboats that both sides send a number of soldiers to board the "Altmark" to monitor it and order it to sail to Bergen, Norway, for inspection in accordance with international law. This method was not accepted by the Norwegian side. The Norwegian captain said that the "Altmark" was not armed, and there was no evidence that it was carrying British prisoners. In addition, the ship had been inspected in the port of Bergen, and the Norwegian authorities had allowed it to sail in territorial waters. At that point, the British destroyer withdrew from territorial waters, but the "Cossack" was then instructed by the Admiralty to re-enter Norwegian territorial waters and decided to inspect the "Altmark." Although the Norwegian gunboats refused to participate, they did not take any action to stop it. The "Altmark" intended to attack the British warship, but when the ship turned, its stern suddenly ran aground. The "Cossack" then sent sailors to board the ship and engaged in combat with the German crew. According to the German side, four members of the ship's crew died and five were seriously injured. The ship was eventually captured. Part of the crew fled ashore, and the rest surrendered to the British warship. The three to four hundred British prisoners who were detained in the cargo hold were freed and taken back to their country by British warships. In addition, the German oil tanker "Baldur" was intercepted by the British destroyer "Ivanhoe" outside Norwegian territorial waters and was scuttled by its own crew. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Today, when British destroyers intercepted the German ship Altmark in the North Sea near the Norwegian coast, they rescued three to four hundred captured merchant seamen, who may be transported to a British port this evening. When the British destroyer Ivanhoe attempted to capture the Altmark, it encountered the German oil tanker Baldur, causing the crew of the Baldur to scuttle their ship. A responsible British spokesman in London, in response to questions about the Altmark, said that if the British Navy did not intervene, the ship would have escorted British prisoners back to Germany via Norwegian territorial waters, which would be a violation of neutrality. The British government believed that the Norwegian government would not allow a German ship to transport British prisoners back to Germany via Norwegian territorial waters, but the Norwegian government failed to maintain the neutrality of its territorial waters, so the British Navy had no choice but to intervene. German ships have recently repeatedly used Norwegian territorial waters to avoid pursuit by British warships. Germany has also used Norwegian territorial waters to conduct military actions against Britain and other countries. On December 7, the British ship Thomas Walton was torpedoed outside Narvik, Norway, killing 16 people. On December 11, a Greek ship was also torpedoed in Norwegian waters, killing four people. On December 13, another British ship was torpedoed only one mile from the Norwegian coast, and the whereabouts of 25 crew members are still unknown. These ships were all sunk within Norwegian territorial waters without warning. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Warship Violates Neutrality; Norway Protests to Britain; German Government Also Protests Strongly to Norway, Believing It Could Lead to Serious Consequences</h3>
<p>Oslo - The Norwegian government has sent a strongly worded protest to the British Foreign Office regarding the "Altmark" case, accusing it of violating Norwegian neutrality. The Norwegian Prime Minister, who also serves as the Foreign Minister, met with the British Minister to Norway, saying that the Norwegian government is extremely indignant at the British warship's serious violation of Norwegian neutrality. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Oslo - The authorities have issued a statement detailing the situation in which a German ship, "Altmark," was boarded by British warships entering Jøssingfjord and capturing several prisoners. It is stated that two Norwegian torpedo boats protested in vain and were ordered to leave because they could not resist the British warships. Today, the Norwegian government ordered its embassy in London to lodge a protest with the British government, demanding that the British Navy respect Norwegian neutrality. The Norwegian government hopes that Britain will provide compensation and satisfaction and return the captured prisoners. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Minister to Norway delivered a written protest to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry this morning, objecting to the actions of British warships against the German ship "Altmark." The wording was very harsh, calling it an unparalleled case in world history and reserving the German government's right to make further demands and deal with the perpetrators with all its might. It also stated that we see the situation as having the possibility of becoming very serious, and such a situation may have significant consequences. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Minister of Air Transport Hoare, speaking in Nottingham today, mentioned the British warship's handling of the German ship "Altmark," and the audience cheered enthusiastically. Hours before the British prisoners from the "Altmark" landed, two public buses were converted into ambulances to assist the naval medical team waiting at the dock. It appears that the crew of the "Altmark" refused to allow Norwegian officers to board and inspect the ship. When the British ship approached the ship, there was heavy gunfire between the two sides. It is said that after the Norwegian pilot left the ship, the captain ran the ship aground. There were hundreds of sailors on board. According to the rescued prisoners, they tried to let the Norwegian officials know they were prisoners when the ship was inspected by Norwegian officials in Bergen, but the Norwegian officials were indifferent.

<h3>British Air and Naval Forces Search the Seas; Five German Submarines Sunk in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Copenhagen - The "National Times" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Berlin, stating that German General Mettokh published an article in a German newspaper today, stating, "Germany will soon intensify its air and submarine warfare in the short term and launch a large-scale offensive against Britain with various new weapons." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - The pilot of a British aircraft in the North Sea saw a German submarine on the surface of the sea and dived quickly. When it was half a mile away, the German submarine saw the British aircraft and quickly submerged. As its periscope had just left the surface of the water, the British aircraft flew over it and dropped two bombs directly in front of and behind the periscope. Then, oil stains and bubbles floated to the surface of the water. The British aircraft continued to observe the area, but did not see any further signs of the German submarine and believed it had been destroyed. So far, Britain has sunk five German submarines in one week, two of which were sunk on Wednesday after they fired torpedoes at two British oil tankers. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Submarine Sinks Dutch Ship; Germany Claims It Was Legal</h3>
<p>Berlin - A German official press agency issued an article to foreign journalists yesterday, claiming that the German submarine's sinking of the Dutch ship "Borgdick" was a legal act. It stated that the sinking was a normal implementation of the prize law procedure. The term contraband applies to ships destined for an enemy country, but the destination stated on the ship's documents was uncertain. Goods intended for neutral countries lose their neutral status if they are attacked by the enemy in a port of a belligerent country. As for whether a ship enters a British inspection port voluntarily or is forced by the British, there is no distinction. In short, the danger to neutral countries is purely the result of the regulations issued by Britain and the compliance of neutral countries with those regulations. Neutral ships should know from this whether or not they should enter British inspection ports. The "Borgdick" was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine on February 11 and was the thirteenth Dutch ship destroyed since the start of the war. Most of the cargo it was carrying was purchased by the Dutch government, such as grain, and the rest was cloth goods purchased by Dutch importers. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Sweden Refuses Military Aid, Finland Expresses Worry and Disappointment; The Interdependence of Sweden's Survival is Threatened; British King Permits Citizens to Voluntarily Enlist in Finnish Army</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Sweden's refusal to provide military aid has caused worry and disappointment here. While political figures acknowledge that Scandinavia should not be drawn into the vortex of war, they also say that its survival is now under threat and that united action is necessary. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Regarding the Swedish government's decision not to cooperate militarily with Finland, the Swedish Daily News recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Finland stating that the general public in that country was extremely shocked upon hearing the news. They all said that since the Nordic countries cannot cooperate effectively, they will gradually be encroached upon by strong neighbors. Furthermore, according to the Liberal Party's newspaper, the Stockholm Times, the Swedish government's current policy on the Finnish issue is due to fear of Germany, because if the European war were to spread to the Scandinavian Peninsula, Germany would definitely not tolerate it and would intervene. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The "Hufvudstadsbladet" (a Swedish-language newspaper) here recently published an article stating, "Although Sweden has provided various forms of assistance to our country in the past, it is difficult for our country to be completely satisfied. This is not out of ingratitude, but because our duty lies in explaining the truth of the situation, and therefore we must do so. The enemy's troop strength far exceeds that of our country, and the nations of the world cannot simply allow our country to fight independently. Our country's armaments and soldiers are in need of resupply, and we have repeatedly issued appeals and received responses from various countries, but the resupply we need is still not enough. Now, Sweden's response to our country's appeal (referring to the refusal to provide military assistance), we do not find surprising, because Sweden is deeply afraid of being drawn into the vortex of war, which we understand. However, whether this narrow interpretation of neutrality is the best way to safeguard the interests of the Nordic countries, there is no need for us to argue further. Swedish public opinion will undoubtedly express itself." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London: King George VI recently issued an order permitting British citizens to voluntarily enlist in the Finnish army. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: Responsible officials here, with the permission of the French Army, announced that France has shipped a large number of cannons and airplanes to Finland. The type of cannons shipped to Finland was not mentioned, but the recent rumor that 700 Soviet tanks were destroyed is a significant hint. Military observers say that the arrival of French and other countries' aircraft on the Finnish front is necessarily related to the downing of 17 Soviet aircraft on Tuesday, Wednesday. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the war between the Soviet Union and Finland, well-informed sources here believe that the Finnish army will not collapse in the short term, but they believe that the issue of aid to that country is increasingly urgent. So far, that country has not formally requested various countries to send volunteer soldiers to assist in the battle. After learning about the news of the fighting in the Karelian Isthmus in southern Finland, the British and French governments have stepped up the exchange of opinions and are about to take appropriate measures to facilitate the departure of volunteer soldiers from the two countries to enlist in Finland. (Note: The British government has suspended the implementation of a law prohibiting its citizens from enlisting in foreign armies.) It is expected that in a few days, the Finnish army will receive various supplies to strengthen its air defense organization, and in a few more days, it will also receive other aid to engage in counterattacks. As for Sweden, recently, a large number of Swedish volunteers have gone to Finland to assist in the battle. The remarks made by Swedish Prime Minister Hansson today, although still ambiguous on the issue of military aid to Finland, are generally believed to have been made for diplomatic reasons, and it is said that the Soviet government has indeed repeatedly put pressure on Sweden in the past, which Sweden originally did not mind. This decision was probably due to Germany complying with the Soviet request and adding pressure again, to which Prime Minister Hansson replied with these remarks. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Smoke and Fog Fill the Summa Front, Finnish Army Fights Valiantly, Soviet Aircraft Groups Assist Army's Advance, Penetrating More Than Ten Miles into the Mannerheim Line</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Smoke and fog fill the Summa front. Helsinki is fiercely resisting the continuous Soviet offensives. It is reported that when the Soviets began shelling, the Finnish troops all took shelter in deep trenches made of cement and large timber. Sometimes they deliberately allowed Soviet tanks to enter the Mannerheim Line and then opened fire to destroy them. It is now believed that the deepest point reached by the Soviet army on the Mannerheim Line is about five miles from the outer edge of the line. The depth of the line varies, from ten to twenty miles. Finnish fighter and bomber pilots are continuing their activities. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: It is reported that Finnish aircraft flew out to bomb railway stations connecting Leningrad and the Karelian Isthmus, and several fires broke out. It is said that if Finland can cut off Soviet traffic to the Karelian Isthmus, the Soviet army will stop attacking the Mannerheim Line, because the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses and cannot continue its current pressure without continuous resupply and reinforcement. Land traffic from the Soviet Union to the Karelian Isthmus is already excessively congested. It is admitted here that the fighting in the Karelian Isthmus is serious, but it is believed that the retreat from the outposts of the Mannerheim Line is not a great loss. These outposts now occupied by the Soviet army are under the flanking fire of positions still held by the Finnish army. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: (This dispatch has been heavily censored by Finnish censors.) According to the Finnish High Command today, although the Soviet army is still pressing on three points of the Mannerheim Line, the Finnish army is still resisting resolutely. At the same time, the Red Army's offensive seems to be showing signs of exhaustion due to the disruption of the rear supply lines. The current Soviet offensive has lasted for fifteen days, and is one of the largest offensives since Germany's unprecedented offensive in the spring of 1918. If it is really showing signs of exhaustion, then the Finnish soldiers who have fought hard for fifteen days will have a chance to catch their breath. It is reported that the Finnish High Command said that the Soviet side is using more than 500 aircraft per day on the front line to assist the advance of ground troops, and that the ground troops' offensive is completely reckless in terms of manpower and material sacrifices.

<h3>Swedish Prime Minister Explains Attitude Towards Aiding Finland, Reaffirms Declaration of Neutrality</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Regarding the Finnish government's request for Swedish aid, Prime Minister Hansson recently made a statement to the press, saying, "The Finnish government has repeatedly requested our government to supply various goods and food, and we have generally satisfied these requests. We have also considered the issue of Finnish wounded soldiers and disabled veterans coming to Sweden for medical treatment, and the issue of ordinary workers from that country immigrating to Sweden. Furthermore, a certain cabinet member of that country raised the issue of military aid. On the 13th of this month, that country's Foreign Minister Tanner discussed this matter with myself and our Foreign Minister Sandler and Defense Minister Sköld. The other side expressed the hope that Sweden would send troops to Finland to assist in the battle. On our side, we stated that our country's general attitude towards aiding that country has been repeatedly explained, as exemplified by my speech in the House of Representatives on the 17th of last month. Our country's view has not changed." According to Hansson's speech on the 17th of last month, "We must work together to solve our country's various problems and help neighboring Finland." Foreign Minister Sandler's speech on the same day said, "Aiding Finland is the unanimous wish of the people of our country. The government's current policy is based on the principle of interdependence between Sweden and Finland, but our country maintains neutrality in the war between the major powers, and our government must always avoid any measures that may be considered a violation of neutrality." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London: According to reports published here, a Swedish government spokesman recently stated in Stockholm, "Sweden does not allow foreign troops to cross its borders." It is said that this prohibition clearly does not apply to the passage of volunteers and supplies who are not part of a foreign regular army. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Economic Cooperation Enters Third Stage, Mutual Relaxation of Various Restrictions, in Order to Develop Trade Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>London: The Anglo-French trade agreement was signed at the Foreign Office at 4 p.m. yesterday. The agreement stipulates that the United Kingdom adopts the same export policy, the purpose of which is to seize the markets previously held by Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland in various parts of the world, and to avoid Anglo-French commercial competition. According to reliable sources, the agreement applies not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to the colonies of both countries. Yesterday, the two sides also negotiated to include the self-governing territories within the scope of the Anglo-French trade agreement. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Officials have announced that British Trade Minister Duncan has reached an agreement with French Trade Minister Chautemps to relax the various commercial restrictions mutually imposed by the two countries since the outbreak of the European war, in order to develop trade relations. It has now been approved by the competent authorities of both countries and put into effect. Political and economic figures here have commented on this. Anglo-French economic cooperation can be divided into three stages. The first stage was the agreement established by Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Daladier, the main points of which were to pool the resources of both countries for common use and to jointly purchase goods from foreign countries. The second stage was the financial agreement signed by Finance Minister Simon and French Finance Minister Reynaud, which resolved the issue of exchange rates between the two countries. Goods from the United Kingdom and the various self-governing territories imported into France are paid for in francs, and vice versa, goods imported from France into the United Kingdom or the various self-governing territories are paid for in pounds. The commercial agreement approved by the two governments today is the third stage of cooperation. From now on, the exchange of letters, parcels, and telegrams between the two sides, and the travel of people from the two countries, will enjoy various conveniences. Transactions between the industrial and commercial circles of both sides can be as rapid as in peacetime. Certain goods that originally required permits before they could be exported to the other side have been completely abolished, and import quotas have also been relaxed.

<h3>Peasant Riots in Various Prefectures of Japan, Destroying Government-Run Rice Warehouses, Opposing Rice Control</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, violent incidents in Japan are becoming more and more intense. The riots in various prefectures have become a prairie fire, with Fukuoka, Nagano, and Tochigi prefectures being the most severe. Nagano is a silk and silkworm concentration area, and its rice supply has always been supplemented by other prefectures. Due to rice control, the people are starving everywhere and have risen up in resistance, destroying many rice warehouses established by the government. Many policemen were killed in the suppression. Tochigi is located north of Tokyo. Farmers in the prefecture organized a Land Rent League to confront the government, resulting in a major riot. Many soldiers and policemen have been killed. The Fukuoka farmers' riot, after the Kurume army was dispatched, incited the anger of farmers in various places, and the unrest is actively evolving. In addition, farmers in Hokkaido, due to lack of food rice, have engaged in group riots and arson everywhere, saying, "The current government is acting perversely, launching wars of aggression, and selling the people's food to buy arms, causing the people to starve to death. Let's rise up and overthrow the warlords and overthrow the government." They also printed and distributed the "Soldier's Friend" newspaper, denouncing the warlords and the government for harming the country. The Japanese government has dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to various places to suppress the riots, and sent the rioting farmers to the coal mines, forcing them to do hard labor, but the riot incidents continue to occur, and the momentum is becoming greater and greater.

<h3>Cabinet Change in Bulgaria, Foreign Policy Unchanged, Defense With Maintaining Peace as Its Goal, Balkan Situation Uncertain</h3>
<p>Sofia: The new Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov made the following statement to the press yesterday afternoon: "The new government's foreign policy will not be changed, and it will continue to implement the policies pursued by the Koseivanov cabinet. The appointment of Popov, the new foreign minister, as a close friend of the former prime minister, is sufficient to prove that the future foreign policy will not be changed. The policies that the new government will implement, in short, are to maintain peace and neutrality, and to seek unity within the country." (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: The new Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov made a statement to reporters here yesterday, saying, "I have received the new order from the government. After the private matters in the embassy are concluded, I will return to the country tomorrow." Popov then asked the reporters to solemnly record the following: "I am an advocate of cooperation between South Bulgaria and I will promote foreign policy based on this principle after taking office as foreign minister." (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Although the news from the Balkan Peninsula after the resignation of the Bulgarian Koseivanov cabinet all said that this move was purely due to domestic political issues, observers here urge Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu, who recently held talks with the authorities in the Bulgarian capital, to urge Bulgaria to join the Balkan Entente. Unexpectedly, Prime Minister Koseivanov resigned after the end of this conversation. It is difficult to speculate at this time what impact this cabinet tide may have on Bulgaria's current foreign policy. However, one point can be asserted: If the resignation of Prime Minister Koseivanov is for Bulgaria to change its policies, then the good results obtained by the current Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente, that is, the results regarding the organization of the security of the Balkan Peninsula, will be severely affected, because the conference decided that the countries of the Balkan Entente should implement mutual assistance. Subsequently, Bulgaria expressed its willingness to temporarily postpone its territorial demands, and thus cooperated with the countries of the Balkan Entente. Therefore, the general staff of the Entente countries have conducted talks based on the change in Bulgaria's policy. Specifically, Bulgaria, geographically, is sufficient to become a shortcut for German or Soviet imperialists to attack the Balkan Peninsula. Bulgaria is willing to approach other countries in the Balkan Peninsula, and the former Prime Minister Koseivanov has also accepted the covenant, stating that he will never allow other countries to pass through the country to attack another country in the Balkan Peninsula. All this is extremely important to the countries of the Balkan Entente and it is hoped that there will be no changes in the future. Moreover, reports have been received in recent days that Germany is making every effort to ensure that the combination of Germany and the Soviet Union does not conflict with the axis policy of Germany and Italy. The change of the Bulgarian cabinet at this time should not be taken lightly. However, according to another reliable source, most of the important figures in Italy are brewing a more practical plan, that is, on the pretext that the Soviet Union's military strength is not strong, they advise Germany to repeat the axis policy of Germany and Italy. These important figures even believe that if this plan can succeed, Germany can become closer to Italy, Spain, and Japan, and the Soviet Union will be isolated. At that time, if France and the United Kingdom are willing to approach a country with a bad reputation, the Soviet Union can cooperate again. It is heard that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also agrees with the above views. It should be noted that this does not seem to fully meet the true wishes of the Italian nation. In any case, if Germany and Italy re-establish their old friendship in the future, the current attitude of the countries in the Balkan Peninsula will inevitably be affected. The change of the Bulgarian cabinet is the reason why it is extremely important to the general public, that is why. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan Monopolizes the Sugar Industry in Southern China</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: Now that the situation in Guangzhou has recovered slightly, the Japanese are intensifying their economic invasion. The fact that the Guangzhou Japanese Chamber of Commerce has more than 700 members shows the extent of Japanese commercial activities here. According to news from this city, the enterprises previously managed by the Chinese authorities have all been taken over by the Japanese. The Shunde Sugar Refinery has also recently been taken over by the Japanese. It is said that the factory is now operated by the Taiwan Sugar Industry Federation, which will soon take over the Dongguan Sugar Refinery. Once the Japanese control these two major sugar refineries, they can monopolize the sugar industry in southern China. At the same time, it is said that the Osaka Municipal Authorities are now sending a team of experts to Guangzhou to investigate the economic possibilities of southern China. After inspecting Guangzhou, they will go to Haikou and Beihai in Hainan Island. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Scientific Refining of Chinese Medicine Successfully Achieved</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, inland transportation has been blocked, foreign exchange rates have soared, and the demand for Western medicines necessary for the military and civilians has increased sharply, and prices have risen sharply. Chinese medicine expert Wang Yaoyu, chemist Kang Tiejun, and others have worked hard to research and use local medicinal materials from Sichuan Province to refine them scientifically, and have achieved success. There are seven types of sodium sulfate, copper sulfate, ferrous sulfate, silver sulfate, physiological saline, pure sulfur, and vegetable petroleum jelly, and three types of special proprietary medicines, namely Jianweiling (for gastrointestinal diseases), Standard Ointment (for skin diseases), and Standard Anti-Swelling Ointment (for various inflammatory swellings). After being adopted by various parties, they are all considered to be no different from imported products, and the selling price is only one-tenth of the latter. If they are mass-produced and sold, it is hoped that a lot of leakage can be plugged. (17th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Lin Yutang Prepares to Return to China</h3>
<p>New York: Chinese writer Dr. Lin Yutang told a reporter from the United Press today that he will return to China in the near future, and Mrs. Lin and his three daughters will also travel with him. Lin believes that the rumors that the Japanese want to claim his head are not credible. When asked when he would leave and which route he would take, Lin declined to answer. According to Lin, Japan will collapse in two years, because it cannot afford to maintain a large army of one million in China. At the same time, its wartime budget has reached an unaffordable level. As for the US loans to China, they will greatly boost Chinese morale. "I think the Chinese people's resistance to Japan is a miracle." As for the Japanese attempt to establish a "new central government" through Wang Jingwei, it will fail. (United Press, 17th)</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Kang Science Exploration Team Reaches Xichang Across the Western Sichuan-Kang Plateau, Exploring New Scientific Resources in Remote Sichuan-Kang Areas</h3>
<p>Chengdu dispatch: The Sichuan-Kang Science Exploration Team of the China-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees, comprising five groups: Geology and Mining, Science and Engineering, Agriculture and Forestry, Society, and Economics, led by the head of the team, Shao Yizhou, and the deputy head, Huang Guozhang, and more than forty team members, departed from Jiading, Sichuan Province, at the beginning of July last year. They first passed through various counties in the Ya'an area and achieved abundant results. In mid-August, they all arrived in Kangding and immediately began their respective explorations. In mid-September, they reorganized their work. The Social and Economic groups, led by group leaders Feng Hanji and Wu Qiyuan, explored various areas in the Ningyuan region. The Agriculture and Forestry group, led by group leader Ye Yage, explored Danba, Maogong, Guanxian, and other areas. The Science and Engineering and Geology and Mining groups, led by the head Shao Yizhou and deputy head Huang Guozhang, explored the northern part of Kangding, from Tai'ning, Daofu, and Luhuo counties, and separately went to the Yuke and Se'erba mining areas for exploration. In mid-October, they arrived in Garzê, which is the political and religious center of northern Kangding and a vital passage to Qinghai and Tibet. The two groups conducted detailed investigations on various situations in the area, including Tibetan affairs. Afterwards, the Geology and Mining group turned south to Dantong, passed through the Greater and Lesser Jin River areas, and went to Maogong, Songpan, and Lifan areas for exploration. The Science and Engineering group and a portion of the Society and Geology and Mining group members, led by head Shao, turned south to Zhanhua and arrived in Lihua, the highest city in East Asia, in November. The first part of this route was the Ya'an River canyon area, with high mountains and deep valleys, precipitous rocks and rugged, tortuous paths. The slightest carelessness would lead to eternal regret. The latter part was the top of the western Sichuan-Kang Plateau, with an average altitude of about 4,000 meters. Although it was the time of the small spring in the inland, the plateau was already covered with ice and snow. At the same time, they crossed the Danzhanila Mountain, which is as high as 5,400 meters. The white snow was deep and reached above the knees. There were no traces of roads to be found, and they felt that their feet could not move forward. The members of the group braved the adventure and advanced, bivouacking in the uninhabited ice and snow wilderness. They finally reached their destination in hardship. After completing the inspection of Lihua, they traveled south through Chongxi, Yisi, Niuchang, Yajiang, Jiulong, Muli, Yanyuan, and other places, arriving in Xichang in late December, totaling more than three months. They traversed more than ten counties north and south of Kang Province. In the places they passed, they conducted detailed investigations on mineral resources, hydrology, transportation, society, economy, education, agriculture, animal husbandry, and other items in the area. In addition, they surveyed and mapped routes, longitudes, latitudes, altitudes, and boiling points. According to the route followed by the group, the distance traversed was more than three thousand miles, connecting the north and south of Kang Province. It is indeed an unprecedented record for all exploration teams in history. In addition, the group hired Sun Mingjing, a cinematographer from the College of Science and the Film Education Department of Jinling University in Chongqing, to film the life styles of the Kang people in the northern Kang area. They further went west to Dege, Baiyu, and Ba'an, and are still working. It is estimated that the group has forty members, from eighteen provinces and two municipalities, and twenty-three universities. They were all recommended by various universities and strictly selected by the Boxer Indemnity Fund, so they are all excellent individuals. The exploration harvest is abundant, and it is hoped that they will make contributions in the future. After the Science and Engineering group arrived in Xichang, their work was completed, and they turned to explore Leibo, Mabian, and Emei and other places. The members of the group are Huang Baoqun, Zhu Zongyin, Zhang Xianfeng, Lu Jielin, Tang Mingqian, Zhou Xueyong, Rao Youhui, Ke Runhua, and Zheng Xiangxian. There are nine people.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Appropriates Funds to Revive Rural Areas in War Zones, Urgently Providing Relief to Nine Counties in Northern Guangdong, Deciding to Raise Two Million Dollars</h3>
<p>Shaoguan dispatch: In order to provide as much relief as possible to the disaster-stricken areas in northern Guangdong and to quickly restore their vitality, in addition to organizing emergency relief and providing loans, Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, proposed raising two million dollars for universal and effective relief. This was passed by the 98th Provincial Affairs Meeting. The proposal is recorded as follows: "In December of the 28th year [1939], the Japanese invaded northern Guangdong. Although we declared a great victory, the residents of the nine counties of Yingde, Wengyuan, Xinfeng, Longmen, Fogang, Conghua, Zengcheng, Huaxian, and Qingyuan, which were harassed, and the people in the areas that were harassed, had their houses mostly burned down, their plowing cattle and livestock were slaughtered, and their seeds were almost completely burned. The refugees are everywhere, sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind. Corpses are all over the fields, and epidemics are feared. It can be said that nine out of ten houses are empty, and the disaster is severe. We should urgently find ways to provide relief and handle pacification, sanitation, and all post-disaster matters to save the disaster-stricken people. It is proposed to raise two million national dollars to handle relief for the counties. The funds are proposed to be raised from: (1) Half of the disaster relief reserve fund stored in the Guangdong Province Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee from the mountain province treasury in the 28th year, totaling 250,000 dollars; (2) 240,000 dollars from the disaster relief reserve fund expenditure item listed in the provincial general budget for the 29th year; (3) 200,000 dollars from the Guangdong Province Relief Association; (4) 1.33 million dollars from the relief fund item in the general budget for the 29th year to make up the sum of two million dollars. The estimated expenditure for relief should be additionally supplemented by 1.08 million dollars, and the source will be compensated by the Finance Department separately. As for the distribution method of the two million dollars, after this case is approved, it will be handed over to the relevant agencies and organizations to jointly form a committee, properly draft it, and present it to the government for approval and implementation." It is also known that after the case was passed, it was handed over to the thirteen relevant agencies and organizations for handling. These agencies and organizations, adhering to the purpose of restoring rural areas in war zones, convened a meeting the other day and passed the organization of the "Guangdong War Zone Rural Reconstruction Committee" to be responsible for this work. The tasks and work procedures that have now been determined are roughly as follows: (1) This two million dollars will be the responsibility of the committee to distribute and send personnel to the nine counties to start work. (2) The amount of relief funds for each county will be transferred depending on the severity of the disaster, with the main aim of seeking universality and practicality. (3) The method of relief is mainly to build simple civilian residences, purchase and donate plowing cattle, seeds, medicines, etc., which are completely free of charge and do not need to be repaid by the recipients. (4) Starting from this month, the task will be completed within a period of five months, in order to rapidly restore the rural areas after the war. After the establishment of the committee, it has convened a second meeting and agreed on the distribution method of the two million dollars in relief funds, and work can be started in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Second China Youth Basketball: Shanghai Youth Wins Championship After Hard Fight, 31-21 Victory Over Bombers After Hard Fight, Bombers Take One-Point Lead in First Half</h3>
<p>The Second China Youth Invitational Basketball Tournament came to a successful conclusion last night. In the Group A finals, Bombers and Shanghai Youth met for the third time.

Unexpectedly, Wang Qiang of Shanghai Youth came on the court, which changed the situation. Da Mao's confident shooting and free throws made Shanghai Youth increase by 13 points in one breath. The Bombers suffered this unexpected blow, and their mentality changed greatly, resulting in numerous fouls. Qu Xilin and Zhang Xianlun were both sent off the court one after another, which was even more of a blow. Although someone took their place, Qian Jingyong, Jia Youliang, and Kong Guangyi tried to make contributions, but instead lost their target, resulting in no gains for more than nine minutes.

Jianbei team leader and ball-drawing general 柦Zhifang, challenged Zhirenyong's Ying Shihua, which was very exciting. As a result, Cheng finally won 3-1 with steady drawing and final effort. The overall result was 4-3, and Zhirenyong was defeated. Jianbei Group B will play against the Dehan Table Tennis Team at 7:00 p.m. tonight (Sunday). The Jianbei Group B lineup is recorded later: Ding Du (leader), Cheng Shuming (secretary), Cheng Zhichu, Jiang Jiming, Feng Chanchu, Zhu Keren, Chen Jiayin, Xia Zongchang, Huang Mingsheng.</p>

<h3>Finance: HSBC Suddenly Throws Out Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. In the gray market for British and American exchange rates, the situation continued to soften in the early hours, and then returned to level, because HSBC suddenly offered to supply. As for the midday process, the morning openings were all level, still at 4 shillings, 5.5625 pence, and 6.84375 yuan. Later, due to the busy settlement of foreign firms, coupled with the fact that outsiders such as Yuli and others had even bought in, the situation once tightened to 4 shillings and 1.09375 pence, and 6.75 yuan. Fortunately, HSBC suddenly supplied, and the Shanghai Chinese and Western speculative merchants such as Sassoon and others also spit out one after another, so the market gradually returned to level. By the close of noon, British gold was still 4 shillings and 1.15625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 6.875 yuan. As a result, the US exchange rate was still up by 0.03125 yuan compared to the previous day, while British gold was level, which was due to the rebound of overseas US and British exchange rates by one point. The potential trend of futures was slightly separated from the spot.</p>
<p>Speculators Return to Sell One After Another</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bars were nearly reduced by 0.0625 yuan, the New York silver price remained level, the London raw gold remained fixed, and the exchange rates between British and American, Shanghai and French currencies were all level. The US dollar was up by some points against the British pound, by a large part against the French franc, and by a small fraction against the Shanghai currency. The central government's listed prices for various exchange rates remained the same. The opening spot selling prices of the banks in the morning were 4 shillings and 1.15625 pence for British gold, and 6.84375 yuan for the US exchange rate. Compared with the previous close, there was no change. After the opening, Yuli first had an appetite for buying, coupled with the settlement of foreign firms afterwards, and the intention of outside suppliers was weak, resulting in a tightening of the market trend. It is estimated that foreign firms settled and bought US dollar spot exchange rates at 6.8125 yuan, and March US dollar at 6.6875 yuan. At the same time, outsiders hedged the British gold for this month at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence. HSBC's listed prices were announced and did not move. The announcement of the silver balance tax also had no increase or decrease. After this, the spot price has been reduced to 4 shillings and 1.09375 pence, and 6.75 yuan. Fortunately, HSBC suddenly supplied and sold the US dollar spot exchange rate to Tonghang Datong and others at 6.8125 yuan and 84375 yuan, and Shanghai Chinese banks also successively sold the US dollar spot exchange rate to Youli at 6.875 yuan. At the same time, there were also speculative merchants selling this month's US dollar at 6.84375 yuan, and Sassoon supplied British gold spot at 4 shillings and 1.5625 pence. Therefore, the situation returned to level. The transactions were sparse at noon, and the buying and selling were mediocre. By the close, British gold was 4 shillings and 1.15625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 6.875 yuan. This month's British gold was 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 6.84375 yuan. Next month's British gold futures were 4 shillings and 0.078125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 6.75 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous day, spot British gold was level, the US exchange rate was up by 0.03125 yuan, and the British gold futures were down by 0.05625 yuan, while the US was down by 0.03125 yuan. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Hesitation, Underlying Strength Remains</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold and after-hours trading fluctuated considerably, generally rising first and then falling, but ultimately closing higher, indicating underlying strength. Expectations for higher prices persisted. In the morning, the market initially rose due to the continued tightening of the exchange rate, with strong buying interest. Gold shops actively purchased, opening at $42,880, a jump of forty-two yuan. The price then rose another thirty yuan to a peak of $42,910. Later, as the exchange rate strengthened after intervention by HSBC, securities firms agreed to sell, and retail investors followed suit, causing the price to retreat to $42,860. However, sudden purchases by Hong Kong firms, coupled with securities firms reversing course to buy, pushed the price back up to $42,905. Subsequently, due to the recovery of foreign exchange rates, certain banks and money changers actively sold, although securities firms returned to scoop up gold, briefly pushing the price down to $42,830. By noon, a certain bank switched from selling to buying, and money changers also came in to buy, so the midday closing price was $42,860, resulting in an increase of twenty-two yuan compared to the closing price of the previous night. However, there was no significant change compared to the final price of the previous day. In the afternoon, there was no formal trading in the market, but there were some after-hours transactions. Turnover was brisk in the morning, estimated at around 3,500 taels. Gold jewelry prices rose first and then retreated, ultimately remaining unchanged. Customs gold remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises Twenty-Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, the price per tael (ten taels) initially opened higher due to the firming of the exchange rate, with strong buying interest. A certain gold shop and jewelry stores competed to release and buy gold. A money changer bought at $42,880 as the opening price, forty-two yuan higher than the previous closing price. Soon after, buying sentiment remained strong, and the price rose another thirty yuan. A gold shop bought fifty taels from a money changer for $42,910. Later, as foreign exchange rates suddenly reported a strengthening, a wave of selling began. Securities firms were the first to vigorously sell, and money changers and retail investors followed suit. Subsequently, the price fell back by fifty yuan. A jewelry store sold twenty taels to a money changer for $42,860. Then, a British money changer suddenly bought on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, coupled with securities firms also reversing course to buy, pushing the price back up by forty-five yuan. A money changer bought fifty taels from a gold shop for $42,905. At that time, customer purchases ceased, and foreign exchange rates continued to weaken. A certain bank and money changers competed to sell, causing the price to fall back by sixty-five yuan. A money changer sold thirty taels to a jewelry store for $42,840. Due to securities firms returning to scoop up gold, the price rose again to $42,870. However, a certain bank and gold shop sold again, and the exchange rate was reported as flat, causing the price to fall again by forty yuan. A certain bank sold forty taels to a money changer for $42,830. At noon, a certain bank switched from selling to buying, and money changers also came in to buy, pulling the price up by thirty-five yuan. A certain bank bought five thousand taels from a money changer for $42,865. Then, a gold shop and money changer sold fifty taels to a securities firm for $42,860 as the midday closing price, resulting in an increase of twenty-two yuan compared to the previous night's closing price. After closing, the price briefly fell to $42,840, but after a certain gold shop scooped up gold, it returned to $42,860. The price fluctuated eighty yuan in the morning. The current selling price of gold from gold shops is several yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the buying price is reduced by twenty yuan. The current bid price is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions taking place.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Initially High, Then Retreat</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in major jewelry stores initially remained at $490. At 9:45 AM, it increased by five yuan. At 10:40 AM, it retreated by five yuan. There were no further changes after that. Ultimately, major jewelry stores still quoted $490. New jewelry stores were the same as the above, with buying prices reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Remain Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, remained strong, and market prices were firm. Large clients continued to absorb British and American gold drafts, and the tight market situation did not ease. The price of American gold drafts initially rose to $14.78 in the morning, but later, as supply improved slightly, the market price eased slightly. At noon, British gold drafts were priced at $53.75, and American gold drafts were priced at $14.59. In the afternoon, supply and demand were scarce, and fluctuations were narrow. The evening prices were $53.60 for British gold drafts and $14.60 for American gold drafts, continuing to be more expensive than the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong drafts was not smooth. Demand for Dutch guilder and rupee drafts increased slightly, and market prices were firm. Demand for Japanese gold drafts was very strong, and market prices continued to rise, reaching $1.33 in the evening. Korean won drafts were weak due to the decline in the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate, and the evening price was $1.04. Yesterday's market prices saw increases of one yuan for both British and American gold pounds, one jiao for British gold drafts, Dutch guilder drafts, and rupee drafts, eight fen for American gold drafts, and four fen for Hong Kong drafts. There were no changes in other currencies.</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs - Rice Prices Soar, Yesterday a Slight Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rising momentum of the rice market had been subdued, due to the decline in the gold market and the excessively high market prices. General merchants could not easily buy, leading to a stagnant sales market. There were no transactions in the morning. Local stores were all watching and not buying. Sellers, wanting to offload their goods, had to lower prices to attract buyers, leading to a sudden drop in prices. The price of foreign rice, such as Saigon rice, fell sharply by more than $1.50. After this price drop, merchants gradually began to buy, but purchases were not smooth. There were no further changes in the market later. It was said that the rise in rice prices was too fierce and the manipulation too aggressive, completely disregarding the municipal authorities' ban. The lack of credibility and public resentment were embarrassing. Therefore, the authorities publicly maintained the factory price of flour at ten yuan to ensure the people's food supply and would announce new measures for rice to safeguard the lives of the general public. Yesterday, rice stores, aware of the high prices, were quite uneasy, and many closed their doors for the entire day. Even small rice shops were closed, causing more anxiety among the poor, which further increased panic. Such self-inflicted and disruptive behavior should be addressed by those responsible for maintaining local security, who should order them to operate normally to reassure the public. Otherwise, it could lead to rice riots.</p>
<p>Yesterday's closing prices were $51 to $50.70 for No. 1 Saigon rice, $48.35 for No. 2 Saigon rice, $49.50 to $49 for fire-milled rice, $46.30 to $46 for Dongshi broken rice, $40, ultimately down to $38 for mixed broken rice, $47.50 for small grain rice, and $44 to $45 for large grain rice. White yuan rice, whether domestic or foreign, was also empty. The prices were $48 for Hong Kong white yuan rice, down to $47, and $48 for Liyang white yuan rice, $46 to $47 for Danyang. The momentum of domestic rice, whether thick or thin glutinous rice, was still weakening, and it was heard that it was difficult to monopolize foreign rice due to the decline in foreign rice prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rising momentum of the foreign rice market was dampened because the supply was abundant, and the government set up a subsidized rice sale at twenty-three locations. The authorities would also make strict inspections, and there were reports of rice riots, so retailers and wholesalers were hesitant to buy. Holders were no longer holding on to their goods. The opening price of No. 1 Saigon rice fell to $51, then to $50.05 to $50, a decrease of $1.50 from the previous day. Other rice varieties also fell by six to seven jiao to one yuan. However, the market recovered at the close due to low prices and sales. It was also reported that the station was re-trading, with small glutinous Siamese rice at $57. No. 2 Saigon rice was at $56.80 to $56.25, with more than 300 tons traded.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Flour Supply, To Be Made Public</h3>
<p>Flour: The rising momentum in the market slowed slightly yesterday. Since the red market, although factory prices have not increased, re-circulated flour prices have risen again and again, without end. Yesterday, due to the easing of rice and oil prices, and the authorities' efforts to stabilize prices, decisive measures would be taken. It was heard that the factories had accepted the advice of the Public Works Department to start increasing supplies to wholesale purchases on this street next week (February 19), from fifty bags to one hundred bags per household. The concession authorities would send police to maintain order and limit the retail price of old "Che Pai" flour to ten yuan and three jiao per bag. Secret investigators would be dispatched to investigate and severely punish manipulative behavior, so people were slightly calmer. However, re-circulated goods were still scarce and expensive, with "Lv Pao Che" brand still as high as sixteen yuan. "Bing Chuan Pai" and "Shi Pao Che" brands were at fifteen yuan and eight jiao, and old "Che Zhan Dan" was at fifteen yuan and five jiao. A total of 5,000 bags were traded. It was heard that "Fenghuang Pai" brand flour from Japanese factories opened at fifteen yuan and then increased by two to three jiao. If the Public Works Department investigated and warned these hoarding and price-gouging re-circulated flours and ordered them to supply the market in batches at fair prices, it would be beneficial to the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Wheat: The rising momentum was particularly strong yesterday. After Suzhou wheat opened at twenty-seven yuan the day before, the sellers were hoarding the goods, and there were no samples in the market. Chinese flour mills had fixed prices for foreign wheat and had no plans to buy. Certain flour mills and MSG factories were still releasing prices to absorb wheat, so the price rose another half yuan yesterday. The price of Suzhou wheat reached a new high of twenty-seven yuan and five jiao. A total of two to three truckloads were traded. It was heard that Chinese factories were also negotiating a batch of Suzhou-Changzhou wheat. The overall situation was slightly subdued in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: Oil Prices Ease Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rising momentum of raw oil and soybean oil was still tense in the morning. Afterwards, due to the easing of gold prices, and the actual sales inevitably decreased because the price soared by about twenty yuan, the market sentiment eased slightly, and there was a lack of manipulative power, leading to a stable overall situation, with no changes in market prices. A total of only 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil were traded in the entire market, priced at ninety yuan; 150 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, priced at one hundred and twenty-three yuan; 20 barrels of Hankou barrel soybean oil, priced at one hundred and twenty yuan; 10 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil, priced at one hundred and twenty-five yuan; 200 pieces of Jiaozhou Road peanut oil, priced at ninety-five yuan; and 15 barrels of Jiangbei barrel raw oil, priced at one hundred and seventeen yuan. On February 17, 3,310 cans of soybean oil arrived from Tianjin, and on February 18, 2,000 pieces of oilseed cake were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Strong Externally, Weak Internally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of soybeans continued to rise sharply. Prices of all soybeans rose by eight jiao to one yuan compared to the previous day. Specifically, 300 bags of Wuhu beans were priced at twenty-eight yuan and five jiao to twenty-nine yuan and five jiao; 100 bags of Qingdao beans were priced at thirty-three yuan and five jiao; more than 1,000 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans were priced from twenty-eight yuan and five jiao to twenty-nine yuan and eight jiao; 50 bags of Pudong Doudou beans were priced at eighteen yuan and seven jiao; and more than 1,500 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were priced from twenty-eight yuan and five jiao to twenty-nine yuan and one jiao. However, judging from the market's trading status, although hoarding was enthusiastic, actual sales gradually eased. Therefore, it would not be surprising if its underlying momentum shifted to a revolving situation after this week of price increases.</p>
<p>Also, on February 18, 5,514 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: Retail Price of Coal Briquettes Exceeds Negotiated Price</h3>
<p>Coal briquette factories should maximize supply to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market.</p>
<p>Although the coal briquette market price is currently being maintained by the guild, which is stabilizing factory prices, users are buying and storing large quantities out of fear of shortages. Coal briquette factories have stopped issuing orders and are expediting old stocks, resulting in an uneven supply and demand situation on the street, with frequent after-hours transactions. Yesterday in the market, Yitaixing and Nanyang coal briquette stock bills were raised to $132, but there were no wholesale goods. Due to demand, retail stores had to resort to desperate measures to maintain operations, so retail prices varied, selling for seven yuan and several jiao to seven yuan per load, exceeding the guild's set price. It is hoped that coal briquette factories can maximize supply to legitimate stores and unify prices, so that unscrupulous merchants cannot manipulate and disrupt the market, which would be a benefit to society.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds: Bond Market Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Securities: The market situation recovered slightly yesterday. Major bulls remained unchanged and even added to their positions in small amounts. It was heard that no matter how the situation changes, there would be no problem with the principal and interest of public bonds. Therefore, the multiple parties felt more courageous. The current market's lack of rising momentum was entirely due to the threat of the shrinking foreign exchange rate and the rising price of gold. Also, capitalists were leaving, so there was a temporary situation of bleakness and apathy. In fact, the two had nothing to do with each other, and the future was still optimistic. At the initial opening yesterday, under the selling pressure of Da Kang Cheng and Lian He, the opening price was low. Later, because Xinfu, Lianyi, and Tongshun engaged in buying, the price gradually recovered. As a result, the price returned by one jiao to three jiao. The volume was around 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Thirty shares of Tianchu MSG Factory stock were traded at eighty yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Association of Industries, because it was the last closing day after this long-term trading process, was crowded with people who had floating profits to settle. As a result, prices fell slightly, but all the stocks that were forced to sell were absorbed. This phenomenon was particularly evident in rubber stocks, China Camp stocks, and Yeguang stocks. There were several exceptions where prices did not rise, such as International Deutz and tram stocks, and each closed at new highs of $24.75, $93.50, and $56.50, respectively.</p>
<p>London, February 16: The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds remained stable today. There were no price fluctuations for bonds at any level.</p>
<p>London, February 16: The listed prices of Far East companies' stocks of British merchants rose slightly today. Baoan Insurance shares rose one pound to twenty-seven and a half pounds, and HSBC Hong Kong registered shares rose half a pound to eighty-seven and a half pounds. The rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Rises Then Stalls, Abundant Outflow at High Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market is volatile, with a tendency to be weak with underlying strength. Those in the financial sector and the wealthy not only refrain from releasing their stockpiles, but continue to buy when prices drop. However, those who are just trying to make a quick profit by buying low and selling high are constantly coming in and out of the market, making it extremely chaotic. Therefore, the market price fluctuates even more. As for the causes of the recent market's sharp rises and falls, the three-day surge of around 100 yuan since the red market has prompted those who have profited to take advantage of the opportunity to release their goods, so the price eases as soon as it rises. However, the large buyers are not willing to release the goods they have bought.</p>
<p>Today's yarn market opened higher. It was heard that the gold market opened higher again, and the exchange rate continued to shrink. The buying sentiment was extremely strong. 20-count Shuangma yarn opened at $875, jumping twenty-five yuan a day. Unexpectedly, as soon as this price opened, sellers followed one after another, and the market price quickly retreated, falling one or two tens of yuan in an instant. Although there was some hovering in the middle, it was still weak overall. As a result, Shuangma yarn returned slightly to close at $846. According to the half-day turnover statistics, 2,105 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by four yuan. Today, 155 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trade is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Traders: 1,960; Hong Kong: 30;</p>
<p>Mainland: 35; Total: 2,105</p>
<h3>Tongzhou Cotton: Breaks Through 200 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>The cotton trade has had an exceptional turnaround. Traders are confident and looking to make a profit, so buying sentiment is strong. The factories also show signs of development. However, since the cotton price started to increase at the red market, it has risen sharply to the top of the clouds, having already increased by twenty yuan, making it significantly more expensive than yarn. Although the yarn market has risen, it has already fallen back by forty yuan. In comparison, the cotton market is too expensive. However, stockpiles are not thick, so those who are holding onto the goods are as steady as Mount Tai. Tongzhou cotton has broken through the 200 yuan barrier, reaching a high price of 203 yuan. 1,369 bales of Subei source Tongzhou cotton arrived. The current cotton trading situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>After the government implemented controls on Zhejiang East cotton, it has not been seen being shipped to Shanghai. At the beginning of the month, the Shanghai-based American company Hengda Foreign Company purchased more than 9,000 bales of Yao cotton in Zhejiang and loaded them onto Taikoo Company's Huangpu for transport to Shanghai. It has already been reported previously. Now it is learned that the second batch of purchases by the company, totaling 10,238 bales, is still loaded on Taikoo Company's Huangpu and arrived in port the day before yesterday (February 16). It is currently being unloaded.</p>
<p>According to another source, the price of foreign cotton, because of the many buyers early yesterday morning in the New York cotton market, so the market was stable. After the same industry bought and short-sellers replenished, the closing price was six or seven pound notes higher than the day before. India, including forecasts, fell one rupee, Egypt rose by ten or more pound notes, and Liverpool fell by five pennies.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade, was quiet again yesterday. Factory purchase intentions were consistently weak. Industry purchase intentions were not as enthusiastic as in the previous few days. Japanese manufacturers were not heard to have a large number of transactions to open. Many Japanese arrivals were for factory limits. There was not much difference in exchange rates yesterday. The factory prices converted at the American exchange rate of $6.875 are as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American Meter Lin 259.0</p>
<p>20 count American Meter Lin low grade 250.00</p>
<p>32 count American Meter Lin 273.00</p>
<p>32 count American Meter Lin low grade 261.00</p>
<p>42 count American Lin Telin 278.00</p>
<p>42 count American Meter Lin low grade 262.00</p>
<h3>Hardware: Prices Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Due to the tightening of the foreign exchange rate, people are more anxious, and asking prices are rising, increasing by 10% to 20% compared to the red market. The market situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Black iron billets: They have been very active since the spring market. However, since the foreign exchange rate tightened in the past two days, factories have reduced their procurement. The current market price is 160-70 yuan for the original 2,000-pound bundle, and 82-3 yuan per 200-pound box, which is 20-30 yuan and 2-3 yuan higher than before.</p>
<p>Company iron: Can factories, toy factories, and printing factories in this street are most actively purchasing, with daily transactions reaching 400-500 boxes. The current market price is 165 yuan per 200-pound box for old steel factories, and 160 yuan per box for new steel factories, each up by five yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Ribbed steel bars: Market stocks are small and sales are strong, so there is a concern that the market supply will not be enough, and asking prices continue to rise. The current market price is 1,005 yuan per ton for 3-4 fen bars and 1,000 yuan per ton for 5 fen bars to 1 inch bars, each up by hundreds of yuan compared to before. American galvanized iron: Transactions are most common among the Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao merchants and the construction merchants in this street. Asking prices remain firm, and standard market prices are rising steadily. For example, thin goods of 48 sheets are sold at eight yuan per sheet, and 18-24 gauge sheets are sold at eighty-five yuan per load. The asking price for 26 gauge is ninety yuan, and the asking price for 28 gauge is around ninety-five yuan.</p>
<p>Factory nails: Due to the intentions of construction merchants and customers, the atmosphere of local factory nails has suddenly become lively, and market prices have increased by two to three yuan. The current market now requires 52 yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Arrowroot Flour Stocks Are Low</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, arrowroot flour has been selling well, resulting in increasingly thin stocks. Recently, the selling price has risen again by two to three yuan. For example, Fei Qilin is 57 yuan, Renqiang 55 yuan, and X and GK are both sold for 55 yuan. Low-end goods are temporarily unavailable. Sago, which is also Dutch, is currently sold for 62 yuan for large grains and 72 yuan for small grains, up three to five yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Both Black and White Pepper Rise</h3>
<p>Since the red market, pepper has been selling well, and in recent days, due to the foreign exchange rate, people are more optimistic. For example, No. 1 pepper, which was sold for 93 yuan in the previous market, now requires 98 yuan. Black pepper also rose by four yuan at the same price, and white pepper rose even more. Wendao goods are 175 yuan, and Dutch goods are 160 yuan to 155 yuan, a sharp increase of more than ten yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Shows Slight Easing</h3>
<p>After the sugar market rose for several consecutive days, the increase has reached as much as six or seven yuan, so yesterday's market slightly returned to one yuan, three or five jiao. The association's set price, spot crude white, local company, 64 and a half yuan, new arrivals in foreign companies initially wrote 65 and a half yuan, then returned to 65 yuan to 64 and a half yuan, old goods 64 yuan to 63 and a half yuan, re-export goods flat, new arrivals 52 yuan, old goods small angle, 51 yuan, Taikoo Che Bai small three or five jiao, B Mark West Company 65 and a half yuan to 65 yuan, CW Mark 64 and a half yuan, CX Mark and DY Mark 64 yuan, HX Mark 63 and a half yuan, West Company goods are reduced by two or three jiao, and Che Chi and He Chi remain unchanged. Local cotton white followed the small one yuan, snow white 64 yuan, local ice original price, according to Dutch telegrams, crude white small one and a half angle, according to C. F. for example, the Dutch currency is 10.25. Local sugar goods opened up before and continued to rise, but remained firm and reluctant to sell, and the trend was strong.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Branches High, Goods Strong</h3>
<p>At the South Market yesterday, the Hong Kong trade opened a batch of glutinous rice branches, with high-grade at 205 yuan and ordinary at 188 yuan. The North Market also opened the day before yesterday, with goods more decisive and prices slightly reduced.</p>
<h3>Spring Bubbled Dumplings Have New Arrivals</h3>
<p>Spring Zhou Bubbled Dumplings have lacked transport for a long time due to obstruction by a certain party during shipping, and market stocks are scarce. Recently, Xin Xiangtai finally began unloading, and a batch arrived the other day, totaling about a thousand odd loads of large and small pieces. The external fees are extremely high, reaching more than forty yuan per load, which is unprecedented. Customers are mostly increasing the price.</p>
<h3>Golden Needle Vegetables Sell Well</h3>
<p>Town traders opened a total of two hundred packs of Golden Needle Vegetables the other two days, with the high-grade written at 48 yuan, with prices fixed at 46 yuan, 45 and a half yuan, 45 yuan, to 43-44 yuan.

<h3>Rice Price Falls Back Sharply; Flour Sold at Reduced Price for One Month; From Tomorrow Until March 19th; Each Bag Sold at a Reduced Price of $10.30</h3>
<p>The Sacrificing Spirit of the Fufeng and Fuxin Factories is Admirable</p>
<p>Recently, the soaring price of flour in this city is of utmost importance to the future of people's food supply. In view of this, the authorities of the Public and French Concessions have consulted with flour factories and flour shops and agreed to implement a one-month reduced-price flour sale from the 19th of this month to the 19th of March, and stipulated six rules for the reduced-price sale: (1) From February 19th of this year to the evening of March 19th, each bag of flour weighing 49 pounds will be sold at the reduced price of $10.30 at all stores (factory wholesale price is $10 per bag, with a handling fee of $0.30 added per bag at the store), with a limit of one bag per person per purchase. (2) All wholesale transactions of flour will be suspended at all reduced-price stores during the reduced-price period. (3) Sales hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM until the allotted number of bags for the day are sold.</p>
<p>Over Seven Thousand Bags Sold Daily</p>
<p>(4) The total number of bags of flour sold daily is stipulated to be 7,500 bags, which will be distributed by the Fufeng and Fuxin flour factories to the reduced-price stores for retail sale. Each store can pick up the number of bags specified on the reduced-price flour distribution list from the two factories the day before, in preparation for the next day's sales (Fufeng is closed on Sundays; 10,000 bags can be distributed on Saturdays). (5) During the reduced-price period, the police of the two concessions will dispatch patrol officers to maintain order at each reduced-price store from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM every day.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven Reduced-Price Stores</p>
<p>(6) The reduced-price flour is limited to the red and blue car brand of Fufeng Factory and the red and green Fuxing brand of Fuxin Factory. All other brands of flour will be suspended from sale at all reduced-price stores during the reduced-price period. It is heard that the above measures have been discussed by the Public Works Department with the authorities of the Fufeng and Fuxin flour companies, and more than 20 representatives of flour shops in this city were convened on the 16th of this month to discuss and implement the plan. The enthusiastic service of each of these flour shops is commendable, and the sacrifice of the Fufeng and Fuxin factories in considering the people's food supply and selling flour at a reduced price is especially worthy of admiration and gratitude. The addresses of the 27 reduced-price stores and the number of bags sold daily are listed below. Those who need flour can go to the nearest store from the 19th of this month to purchase it according to the stipulated method.</p>

<p>There are a Total of Forty Reduced-Price Rice Selling Locations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Reduced-Price Rice Committee resolved that from February 23rd, it will entrust members of the Rice Shop Association to handle the second phase of reduced-price rice sales. Each person is limited to purchasing one yuan, and each yuan is equivalent to five and a half catties. Chairman Yu Qiaqing of the committee has already discussed this with Chairman Zhang Nianxuan of the Rice Shop Association, and it has been approved and accepted by the Rice Shop Association. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound Society learned from relevant sources that a total of 40 reduced-price locations will be set up in the two concessions, with 24 locations in the Public Concession and 16 locations in the French Concession. Each location will designate one rice shop to be responsible for selling tickets and one rice shop to be responsible for dispensing rice. The time will be from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, and each location will temporarily sell 50 bags of rice per day, until they are sold out. The order during the reduced-price sales will be maintained by the police department of the concession authorities. The locations of the reduced-price rice sales are being distributed by the Rice Shop Association and will be announced as soon as they are decided, so that the public can be informed. As for the 11,000 bags of broken rice that the Reduced-Price Rice Committee ordered from Saigon for the second time, they have already arrived in Shanghai and are temporarily stored in bank warehouses. The approximately 34,000 bags of spot goods purchased from the Shanghai market earlier are also stored in the warehouses.</p>
<p>Rice Stores in Hongkou Close Due to Rice Grab</p>
<p>After the price of foreign rice broke the 50-yuan mark, the domestic rice market, due to the price limit imposed by the Public Works Department, was in a state of having a market but no goods. Alternative sales of rice exceeded the price limit by more than 10 yuan. Therefore, the citizens deeply hoped that the authorities would strictly enforce the price limit for rice stores. Due to the pressure of making a living, a rice grab occurred in Hongkou the day before. All rice stores in the city, fearing being affected, closed their doors again yesterday morning, only opening a small window for transactions. After the rice stores closed due to fear of rice grabbing, they also feared that civilians would grab rice trucks along the way, so they temporarily suspended the delivery of whole loads and also temporarily suspended purchases, resulting in sluggish rice sales. After the rice market opened, because there were only sellers and most of the buyers were futures, the selling price of each item fell by about one yuan. This is sufficient proof that the accumulation of inventory by households has been reversed.</p>
<h3>To Curb Rising Prices, Only Drastic Laws and Severe Punishments Can Be Adopted; Relevant Authorities Should Act Immediately</h3>
<p>Yu Lin Bao carries a reader's letter stating, "Everything we eat depends on the food merchants in this city who take the opportunity to hoard and profit. I make this statement, and I deeply believe that the public shares this sentiment. There is no real reason why local fresh produce is so expensive. The leaders of the two concessions should establish a food committee to curb the insatiable greed of meat and vegetable merchants. This is the time to do so. A city like Shanghai, with the capable administrative staff of the Public Works Department, can be proud, yet it ignores this matter, which is truly shameful. I dare to say that if Miss Xing Te were appointed to handle this matter, she would achieve even better results. There is only one way to deal with those who take the opportunity to profit: either impose heavy fines, imprisonment, or revoke their business licenses. Immediate and drastic action must be taken, and the relevant authorities must do so. Otherwise, those who take the opportunity to profit will believe that they can act with impunity and continue to raise food prices."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing Issues a Statement</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound Society visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader of the business community in this city, yesterday. Mr. Yu received the reporter and issued the following statement: "The rice panic in this city has been going on for more than a day. In order to maintain the livelihood of the common people, leaders of various industries and enthusiastic people from all walks of life cannot stand idly by. I have initiated the People's Food Adjustment Association and proposed group purchases of rice in order to increase supply. At the same time, I have joined hands with enthusiastic people to establish the Reduced-Price Rice Committee. In recent days, rice prices have become increasingly severe. The Reduced-Price Rice Committee has met and decided to entrust members of the Rice Shop Association in this city to continue handling the reduced-price rice sales from the 23rd of this month. However, the price of broken rice is rising daily, making it difficult to continue the program. If the exchange rate and freight rates continue to increase in the future, the losses will be even greater. In order for the reduced-price rice sales to continue, it is necessary for all sectors and industries to actively subscribe and donate funds. After all, people have a natural duty to help each other, and saving others is saving oneself. Once people's hearts are at ease, all industries can develop, which is very obvious. As for coal, the price of coal has soared recently, which has a huge impact on the livelihood of the common people, and the price of coal briquettes, which are needed daily, has also increased at the same time. The future is worrying. It has been found that the price of coal shipped from overseas to Shanghai has not increased due to the exchange rate and freight rates, while the selling price of ordinary domestic coal, such as Kai Ping coal, has not increased significantly. However, outsiders are treating it the same as Indian coal and increasing the price gradually, which seems to be inappropriate. I feel uneasy and cannot remain silent. I have already sent letters to the Coal Industry Association and the Coal Briquette Factory Association, asking them to quickly work together to find a way to stop this." Mr. Yu also said, "At a time when rice and coal prices are soaring and the cost of living is rising daily, the general salaried class feels that it is difficult to make ends meet. I have received letters from employees of various industries and Chinese police officers from various police stations, asking me to uphold justice and increase subsidies. Now, the Public Works Department has this suggestion for Chinese police officers and should have a reasonable solution. It is hoped that all industries will take into account the livelihood of their employees and voluntarily increase subsidies to help them maintain their living."</p>
<h3>Pudong Yanpu Open Area is Extremely Restrictive; Residents Still Need "Citizen Certificates" Within the Japanese Navy "Defense Zone"</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Naval Landing Forces' defense zone in the Yanpu area of Pudong was opened on the 15th, the coastal警戒線 was also announced to be lifted. According to a reporter's investigation, those who travel by boat from the Public and French Concessions to Pudong can only land at the Dongchang Road and Qichang Wharf, two ferry terminals within the naval area, without "Citizen Certificates". However, they must still undergo physical examinations, and they still feel very restricted. As for the Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu ferry terminals in South Huangpu, and the Gaojing, Donggou, and Gaoqiao ferry terminals in North Huangpu, which are under the jurisdiction of the Army's defense zone, those without Citizen Certificates will still be forcibly detained. Therefore, the opened area along the coast only accounts for slightly less than three-tenths. Moreover, residents who live in the opened naval area still need to apply for "Citizen Certificates" and are subject to infinite restrictions.</p>
<h3>New Police Force Meeting to Begin Next Week</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that the agreement between the Public Works Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" on the extension roads in the western district of Shanghai was signed yesterday (the 16th) at 6:15 PM. The agreement stipulates the establishment of a new police force in the extension roads area. The meeting to appoint members of the police force is expected to begin next week.</p>
<h3>The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is Open to Traffic; Officially Open to Traffic from the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Bai Zhai Station area, 82 kilometers from the border of Hekou on the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, was bombed again by Japanese aircraft on the 1st of this month. About 200 yards north of the station, there is a huge bridge, with a tunnel leading into a mountain in front of the bridge. Fortunately, the bombs dropped this time did not hit the bridge. However, several bombs hit the entrance of the mountain tunnel. At that time, a passenger train was sheltering in the tunnel. About 80 passengers on the train were hit by rocks and shrapnel, either dying or being injured. The rocks on the top of the tunnel were also shaken and fell, causing the entire tunnel to be sealed off, making repairs quite difficult. Recently, a telegram came from Haiphong, saying that the damaged section had been repaired and that ordinary trains between Hekou and Kunming had officially resumed traffic on the 15th of this month. As for the section between Haiphong and Lao Cai (i.e., the Vietnamese section), ordinary and special trains still run according to the original schedule. Now that both the Chinese and Vietnamese sections can be traversed, it is indeed very convenient for travelers.</p>
<h3>National Unified Sales of Pig Bristles to be Handled by the Central Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has previously instructed all customs offices by telegram that before the unified sales organization in charge of the four types of goods under the national unified sales plan stipulates separate transshipment methods, the regulations for restricting the transshipment of foreign exchange settlement goods will be temporarily used. The method for unified sales of pig bristles proposed by the Central Trust Bureau has been approved by the Executive Yuan for record and has been promulgated. The implementation rules proposed according to this method have also been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The pig bristle item should be handled in accordance with the method approved by the bureau. The method and implementation rules were sent to all customs offices yesterday for compliance. The implementation rules for the national unified sales of pig bristles are as follows: Article 1. These implementation rules are formulated in accordance with the national unified sales method for pig bristles. Article 2. The Central Trust Bureau shall handle the national unified sales of pig bristles and shall temporarily divide the national pig bristle producing areas into six regions: Sichuan-Guizhou, Gansu-Shaanxi, Yunnan, Hunan-Guangxi-Guangdong, and Fujian. Each region shall have one general receiving office, and receiving sub-offices shall be established at important pig bristle producing locations in each region to engage in purchasing. Article 3. The pig bristle business firms and shops mentioned in the original method must meet one of the following conditions: 1. Establish a washing facility to purchase raw hair from farmers or peddlers, wash and process it into cooked bristles themselves, and use the firm name as the object. 2. Establish a firm name to purchase cooked bristles exclusively from washing facilities and create brand names for sales. 3. Cooperative societies organized by farmers and hair peddlers. 4. Firms that specialize in pig bristles. Article 4. Pig bristle business firms and shops should apply for registration with the local or nearest general or sub-office established by the Central Trust Bureau. Article 5.

Organizational situation. 6. Business overview. 7. Name of the person in charge. Article 6. Those who do not normally engage in pig bristles but temporarily囤积 in the hope of speculation and profit and do not meet one of the requirements in Article 3 shall not be regarded as pig bristle business firms and shops and may be refused registration. Article 7. All pig bristle business firms and shops and hair peddlers in various places must sell to the local or nearest general or sub-office established by the Central Trust Bureau and must not transport them to other ports for sale. Article 8. If there is no washing facility established locally and the hair bristles must be transported to other ports for washing, an application must be made for the permission of the general or sub-office of the Central Trust Bureau; otherwise, it will be regarded as smuggling and dealt with according to law. Article 9. The applicant for transshipment in Article 7 must be a pig bristle business firm and shop as stipulated in Article 3. Article 10.

The same shall apply when amending or repealing them.</p>
<h3>Reasons Why Coal Briquettes are Difficult to Buy: Over 20,000 Tons are Hoarded; Seven Coal Briquette Factories Have This Amount in Stock; Expediting Delivery to Stop Hoarding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent letters to the seven coal briquette factories, Yitaixing, Guohua, Yuedong, Nanyang, Guanghua, Jinghua, and Dongfang, yesterday, stating: "We have read the announcement from your factories urging the delivery of coal briquettes, stating that 'As of February 14th, there are a total of over 20,000 tons of warehouse receipts that have been issued continuously by our factories but have not been used to take delivery of goods. The existing coal in our factories is only enough to supply the delivery of warehouse receipts. From now on, we will stop issuing warehouse receipts and respectfully request all customers to pay the warehouse rent to the factories and take delivery of the goods immediately.' This is a clear example of someone hoarding for profit. Our association deeply admires and appreciates your factories' concern for people's livelihood, urging delivery, and ceasing to issue warehouse receipts. As the price of coal has soared and the people's livelihood is in a state of panic, the situation has become critical. Those who only care about their own private interests and disregard the hardships of the people should be given a more serious warning. Therefore, we specially request that your factories strictly limit the customers who have coal stored in your warehouses to deliver all the goods within the specified date. If they fail to do so by the deadline, the goods will be sold at cost price, and the customers will be refunded the amount they have already paid, in order to stop hoarding and extend the lives of the citizens."</p>
<h3>Proving that China Will Surely Win from the Ratio of Casualties; Percentage of Chinese and Japanese Military Deaths, Injuries, and KIA; Chinese Losses are Less Than Japan's</h3>
<p>Notable Figure Research Yu Lin</p>
<p>Bao carries a reader's letter signed "History Researcher," stating: "I recently read a booklet by Julian Arnold titled "The Fate of China and the Future of America." I am excerpting below some rough statistics on the Chinese war as of January 1st (whether this refers to 1940 is unknown):</p>
<p>Japanese troops landed in China: 1,300,000</p>
<p>Japanese casualties: 600,000</p>
<p>Japanese killed in action: 250,000</p>
<p>Chinese government troops in the theater: 3,500,000</p>
<p>Chinese casualties: 1,500,000</p>
<p>Chinese killed in action: 600,000</p>
<p>Calculated in another way, the results are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Percentage Chinese Percentage</p>
<p>Percentage of casualties to the total number of troops in the theater: 46 43</p>
<p>Percentage of KIA to the total number of troops in the theater: 19 17</p>
<p>Previously, Japan was able to obtain war equipment from overseas, especially the United States, so the Japanese army was far superior to the Chinese army in terms of equipment. However, based on the percentage, the losses suffered by the Japanese army have been greater than those of the Chinese army. Now that the United States has at least morally prohibited supplying Japan with equipment for fighting in China, the Japanese army's advantage in equipment will gradually decrease. In material terms, the Chinese and Japanese armies will eventually fight on more equal terms, and the Chinese army only needs to maintain its recent fighting spirit until its overwhelming superiority in strength causes the Japanese army to suffer a greater percentage of losses. The result will be that the Japanese efforts will completely collapse. According to推断, this is the most brutal war of attrition, but the significance of the above figures should be made known to the general Chinese population, so that they know that if they stand firm and persevere, they will surely win the final victory."</p>
<h3>Brick and Tile Boat Carrying Rice is Confiscated by Japanese</h3>
<p>The Japanese puppets do not slacken in prohibiting the transportation of rice into the concessions. Therefore, small boats bringing a small amount of rice from the interior, or bringing slightly more rice for their own consumption, will be confiscated and heavily fined if discovered. In the past, the above problems occurred repeatedly, and the general boatmen dared not bring more rice. At about 4:30 PM yesterday, a brick and tile boat was docked at the south end of the Bund Observatory Wharf in the French Concession. The boat, carrying about 1,000担, had already unloaded the bricks and tiles. It was heard that a few bags of rice purchased by the boat from the interior were known to unscrupulous people, who reported it to the Yangjiadu "Water Patrol Team." The team sent a small boat flying the five-color flag, and four Japanese sailors jumped onto the brick and tile boat. The boatman had already known that he had been reported and had moved the rice ashore. The Japanese sailors searched the boat and found nothing. The boatman had fled ashore. The four Japanese sailors then planned to tow the boat away, but because the iron chain anchor thrown by the boat could not be pulled up, and the wire rope could not be untied, they sawed the anchor chain and cut the wire rope with a knife and towed the boat and a small skiff away. In the middle of the river, another small boat came, and the two boats clamped the boat on two sides and were about to sail south when the Japanese Maritime Gendarmerie, stationed in the water shop, also received a report and sent a small boat to come and tow the boat away. The two small boats flying the five-color flag refused to give way. After negotiations, the small boat of the Maritime Gendarmerie sailed away, and the one small boat clamped the brick and tile boat and sailed south quickly. It was heard that it was being towed to the Yangjiadu "Water Patrol Team." The boatman was being abused.</p>
<h3>Chinese Invent Dual-Purpose Telephone; Ministry of Economic Affairs Grants Patent</h3>
<p>Shen Zengfa of the Shanghai International Telephone Manufacturing Factory recently invented a wall-mounted/tabletop dual-purpose telephone. He submitted an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which was reviewed and approved by the Industrial Technology Incentive Review Committee and granted a three-year patent. The earpiece holder and nameplate inside the case of the tabletop telephone can be interchanged in position, and there are dual弹簧 under the earpiece holder. When the position of the earpiece holder is changed, either spring can be used as a switch. Therefore, it can be used as both a wall-mounted and tabletop telephone, and the change is very convenient, without the need for special tools. This can save telephone companies the trouble of preparing two types of telephone materials. In the military, where there are frequent moves, it is more convenient to use it as a wall-mounted telephone sometimes and a tabletop telephone at other times. This telephone is welcomed by Yibade Electrical Appliances Company Manager, welcome to test and visit from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Continues to Receive Donations</h3>
<p>According to Brigadier Morley of the Salvation Army, the total amount of donations raised by the Salvation Army has reached more than 82,000 yuan. Yesterday, a Chinese man generously donated 100 yuan. An American insurance company and its Chinese employees, as well as American employees, made large donations. Chinese colleagues from the British company Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., Ltd. collectively donated 190 yuan. In previous years, the Salvation Army's donations were usually raised individually from private individuals. This year, due to the many affairs, the officers have been unable to promote this aspect, and they sincerely hope that enthusiastic philanthropists will contact the Salvation Army headquarters directly. Morley also said that he was extremely impressed and grateful for the generosity of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Czech Emigrants Raise Funds and Remit Them to the French Front; Extremely Difficult Situation; Raising Funds is Not Easy</h3>
<p>A small number of Czech immigrants in Shanghai are raising funds again and have raised 26,000 francs to be remitted to the Czech Red Cross in Paris to be sent to Czech soldiers fighting on the British and French fronts. Not long ago, it was learned that Czech immigrants in Hong Kong also raised 100,000 francs and sent them to the front lines to救济 the Czech战队 soldiers. Many Czechs in Shanghai are fighting on the front lines, while their families remain here. It was not easy to raise this amount of money this time. The Czech consul himself is currently far away in Mumbai, India, which shows the patriotism of the Czech immigrants.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Reporter Elucidates: American Far East Policy: Threats to American Interests Absolutely Intolerable, Striving for Orderly Development of Trade with China</h3>
<p>China is the New Outpost of World Modern Civilization</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Costanello, a well-known American newspaper reporter who has resided in Hawaii for a long time and is well-versed in the naval policies of the United States in the Pacific, recently traveled to Shanghai via Japan. Yesterday (the 16th), he told reporters that China has a great future, and the United States intends to strengthen its naval power in the Pacific to ensure that it occupies a major assisting position in China's development. The U.S. Navy does not want to incite wars against any Asian country, but Japanese officials have had a tendency to intimidate the people with the possibility of war against the United States.</p>
<p>Definite American Policy Towards the Far East</p>
<p>Mr. Costanello recounted the American policy towards the Far East over the years, saying that before the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty in 1922, the United States had never clearly stated its attitude towards Asia, but only dealt with each issue as it arose. The reason for this was partly because the volume of trade between the two hemispheres was relatively small. Since 1922, the United States has been increasing its surplus products to Asia, and the United States has begun to have a definite policy towards the Far East.</p>
<p>Strengthening Defenses in the Pacific</p>
<p>The United States is strengthening its navy in the Pacific only to ensure that it is not ousted from the East due to sudden incidents. The United States intends to make itself very powerful, and anyone who threatens American interests in the Pacific will have a fierce battle, otherwise, they must not threaten them. There are now two opinions in the United States regarding whether there should be a fleet in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. A compromise solution is to strengthen American defenses in the Pacific and establish as close a connection as possible with the Asian continent.</p>
<p>Future Trends of the U.S. Navy</p>
<p>As for the recent announcement by the United States to improve Guam Island into a U.S. naval port, this had already become inevitable in August of last year. If the Philippines becomes independent in 1946, then Guam Island will be of no value to the navy, and the U.S. Navy will have to make Hawaii the foremost defense line in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Future of Japan is Not Optimistic</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, Mr. Costanello stated that the Japanese people are becoming increasingly unstable under military rule, and are now expressing their attitude through the Diet. If Japan wins the war, its industry will prosper, but if it loses, there is a possibility of a terrible recession. There is a growing sense among Japanese intellectuals that if it proves that the three northeastern provinces and North China have economic importance, then the war should be stopped. However, if Japan proposes such a compromise solution, the Chinese government will have no possibility of ceasing hostilities.</p>
<p>The Abolition of the Commercial Treaty is of Great Significance</p>
<p>The American move to abolish the commercial treaty with Japan is to point out to Japan that the various conditions it has violated are not scraps of paper but sacred documents. Now the United States can cut off Japan's lifeline with a single move, namely the kerosene supplied by the United States. Japanese businessmen all know this, so they are doing their best to advocate a ceasefire. What the United States seeks is to ensure the orderly development of future trade with China. China is the new outpost of world modern civilization, he said. After touring Shanghai, Mr. Costanello will go to North China and the three northeastern provinces to study the colonization situation of the Japanese in that area, and will enter Harvard University in the autumn to study political economy.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed on Rue des Soeurs Yesterday Morning: Lu Da Shot Dead, Bullet Pierces Chest, Assailant Escapes; Deceased was a Salt Industry Figure</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:30 AM yesterday, another shooting occurred on Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession of this city. The victim of the attack was Lu Da from Wuxian, Jiangsu Province. A bullet pierced his chest and back, killing him on the spot. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Familiar with Salt Affairs</p>
<p>Lu Da, also known as Tongsen, was a native of Suzhou and 50 years old. He previously worked in the Salt Affairs Audit Office organized in Bengbu. He served for a short time and amassed a considerable sum of money. He recently came to Shanghai and resided at No. 152 Huanlong Road in the French Concession, and worked at Tongyuan Salt Industry Company at No. 50 Jiujiang Road in this city. Lu has been involved in the salt industry for many years and is quite familiar with the salt affairs situation. He is skilled at maneuvering and lives a prosperous life.</p>
<p>Bullet Hits Vital Spot</p>
<p>Lu went out yesterday morning, wearing a light gray hat and silk shoes, walking slowly. At approximately 8:30 AM, when he was passing the entrance of Lane 1, Qingshun Lane, No. 99, at the intersection of Pu Yuan Stone Road and Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession, two men suddenly pulled out pistols and attacked Lu. Gunshots rang out, three shots in succession. Lu, caught off guard, was unable to dodge and was hit by a bullet that entered his back and exited his chest. Because it hit a vital spot, he immediately fell into a pool of blood. The assailants, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, mingled into the crowd and escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>Examining the Corpse</p>
<p>After the incident, the French police received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to impose a cordon and searched the surrounding lanes, but found nothing. Only a few bullet casings were recovered and taken back for investigation. By the time Lu was shot, he had already died from serious injuries. The corpse was taken to the autopsy room on Route Tenant de St Just. At noon on the same day, the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court was reported to examine Lu's corpse and confirmed that Lu's death was due to a gunshot wound. The corpse was claimed by Lu Xinrong with a bond for burial.</p>
<p>Details of the Cause</p>
<p>As for whether Lu's murder has political relations, the police authorities are conducting a thorough investigation and ordering the arrest of the murderer to be brought to justice. Lu has two young sons. However, after the incident, Tongyuan Salt Industry Company told people that they denied that Lu was an employee of the company.</p>
<h3>Inmates in Prison Extorting Money Through Intimidation</h3>
<p>Wang Asan, a native of Pudong and a mud mason by trade, 26 years old, in the winter of the 26th year, along with Zhang Bao, a rogue from Suzhou, abducted women to the occupied areas to serve as comfort women for the Japanese army. After the victims escaped and sued to the Special No. 2 Court, the result was a sentence of seven years imprisonment. Wang also committed the same crime in the British Concession and was sentenced to five years by the Special No. 1 Court. The two sentences were combined for a total of ten years, and he and Zhang were serving their sentences in the Special No. 3 Prison. When the Special No. 2 Court was hearing the case, Zhu Songdao, a local, was summoned to testify against them, causing Wang and Zhang to harbor deep resentment towards Zhu, but they had no way to retaliate. Zhang died of illness in prison last year. Wang was assigned to serve in the prison infirmary. Zhu Songdao, who had testified before, was arrested for a smoking case in December last year, and was sentenced to a fine by the Special No. 2 Court and sent to the drug rehabilitation center for one month to quit smoking. Wang saw this and on the morning of January 18, colluded with Wang Shilong (a native of Zhenjiang and Wang Asan's old boss), who was also in jail for murder, to intimidate and extort Zhu, but was unsuccessful. The next day, after Zhu completed his drug rehabilitation and was released home, the two Wangs learned of this and sent someone to Zhu's home to force him to hand over money, claiming that if they did not succeed, they would definitely find a way to frame Zhu and send him back to prison to vent their anger. Zhu, seeing that Wang and others dared to extort money in the prison and then sent people to his home to intimidate him, showing no regard for the law, specially filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Wang Shilong and Wang Asan of extortion and intimidation, and requesting a trial according to law. The court, upon receiving the complaint, opened a court session yesterday afternoon presided over by Judge Zhang Minsheng to interrogate them. Because the registration number of the defendant Wang Shilong was unknown, only Wang Asan was brought to court. After briefly questioning the plaintiff, it was decided to postpone the hearing until Wang Shilong could be brought to court. Wang Asan was sent back to the salt prison.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Stabbed to Death</h3>
<p>Near Siming Villa at No. 608 Yuyuan Road, a "badland" area outside the settlement in western Shanghai, a sudden assassination occurred at around 11:00 AM yesterday. The victim was a gatekeeper named Wu Shaowan. He was fatally stabbed in the vital part of his waist and died instantly. It is understood that the assailant was a small shoemaker surnamed Jia who set up a stall at the entrance of Lane 680 Yuyuan Road (directly opposite Zhongshi New Village). Because he failed to repay a loan (borrowed last year) from the gatekeeper, a dispute arose. The small shoemaker harbored resentment and used a leather-cutting knife to slash the gatekeeper's waist twice, causing him to die from serious injuries.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Run Over by Car</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Sacré-Cœur, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, a pedestrian in his thirties, wearing a coffee-colored camel hair long gown and suede shoes, was about to cross the road when a French-owned No. 22 public bus (license plate number 832, driven by driver No. 221) sped past. The man was unable to dodge in time and was knocked down, with the wheels running over his head, causing severe injuries. Nearby Chinese police officers rushed to the scene and rushed him to the hospital for treatment in a vehicle. At the same time, the driver who caused the accident was taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Numerous Theft Cases in Hongkou: Thief Gang Cracked, Six Gang Leaders and Others Arrested</h3>
<p>According to Japanese announcements, theft gangs in Hongkou have been extremely rampant recently. Many large merchants in Hongkou have been broken into and robbed by these people, resulting in significant losses over time. Although the Japanese police have been conducting rigorous investigations, they have not yet solved the case. It was not until the 15th of this month that it was discovered that the general headquarters of this theft gang was located at No. 11 Yulele Lane, Qiujiang Road. The leader's name was Wang Zhiming. They immediately mobilized all Japanese police officers at 5:00 AM to surround the area and arrest Wang and five of his accomplices. A large number of stolen goods, including dozens of bags of cotton and rice, radios, and other items, were seized.</p>

<h3>Gatekeeper Shot Dead: Accessory Sentenced</h3>
<p>Jiang Youcai, a gatekeeper at Zhenlun Silk Factory at the intersection of Seymour Road and Route Maréchal Joffre, was suddenly shot and killed at 6:00 AM on February 13th of last year. Subsequently, the police arrested several suspects and sent them to trial. They also confessed that the instigator was named Du Jinbiao, and an order was issued for his arrest. Du was arrested by Yuan Xinzhong, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road police station, and sent to the First Special Court. The police charged Du with not only instigating murder but also with 12 cases of instigating robbery. However, Du vehemently denied the charges, claiming that he was being framed, and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him in court. Judge Fu Lin, considering the seriousness of the case, sought detailed information and repeatedly postponed the investigation to gather evidence. The hearing was concluded and the sentence was pronounced in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. Du Jinbiao was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for receiving stolen goods. If he was allowed to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that he reserved the right to appeal. The court ordered Du to submit a guarantee of 5,000 yuan within the appeal period to be allowed to be released on bail pending appeal.</p>
<h3>Pirates Looted the Hanhe Steamer: Suspects Arrested and Charged: Claimed to be Working for the "Self-Defense Corps"</h3>
<p>Wang Qichang, a native of Yangzhou, 30 years old, and Zhu Kaihong, a native of Haizhou, 33 years old, have recently turned to piracy and specialize in looting at sea. At approximately 7:00 AM on the 16th, Wang and Zhu drove a small boat out of the Wusong Estuary and berthed alongside the British Jardine Matheson's Hanhe steamer, intending to rob it. They carried box cannons. After boarding the ship, they first fired a shot to demonstrate, but it was spotted by a Russian guard on the ship, who immediately fired back in resistance. A bullet hit Wang's head, killing him on the spot. Zhu was also captured, his box cannon was seized, and he was brought to Shanghai and reported to the Marine Police Station. The Marine Police Station dispatched detectives to interrogate the captured thief Zhu Kaihong. At the same time, the Marine Police Station notified the French Police Station to transport Wang's body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court was reported to come to the hall to examine the body. Zhu confessed that he was not a thief but was now working for the "Self-Defense Corps" and was boarding the ship to inspect the cargo, not intending to rob it. The court ruled that Wang's body should be buried by the hall and await relatives to claim it. Zhu was still taken back by the original detective for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yu Huisheng Arrested for Peddling Counterfeit Stamps</h3>
<p>Robert Rosenburg, a Western doctor, usually likes to collect various stamps. If he encounters old stamps, he does not hesitate to spend a lot of money to buy them. Recently, Xu Sen, the owner of Shanghai Guangming Bookstore at No. 877 Jing'an Temple Road, peddled three stamp albums to Rosenburg, asking for 50 yuan. After Rosenburg examined them, he thought that these stamps were worth a lot, and the ordinary market price was about 50 US dollars (totaling 5600 French francs), which was too far apart. He was quite suspicious and studied them with his friends before he knew that they were all counterfeits and worthless. He then accused Xu of fraud and negotiated with him. According to Xu, these stamps were not his own, but belonged to Yu Huisheng, a Cantonese man living at No. 3, Lane 1317, Route Lafayette in the French Concession. The day before yesterday afternoon, Yu came to Xu's place again, and he was reported to the New Gate Police Station. Detectives Ma Zhongrong and Pi Bingzhang were dispatched to arrest Yu Huisheng. A lot of stamps were found on his person and in his residence, many of which were forged. He was then taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyers Jiang Baolian and Peng Qi started by stating the facts of the case, saying that the various stamps seized in this case still needed to be examined by experts, so they requested permission to detain Yu. In response, Yu hired two lawyers, Wang Yaotang and Zhu Hui, to defend him in court. The judge ruled that Yu Huisheng would be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Finland's New Tactics</h3>
<p>-- Hou</p>
<p>Because of Heavenly Timing and Geographical Advantage</p>
<p>Therefore, it can defeat the large with the small.</p>
<p>The Russian army attacked Finland, advancing from both north and south. Initially, it intended to first secure the northern route and then capture the southern route. However, due to the pressing time and cold season, the northern route could not be established. Therefore, after more than a month of stalemate, the center of gravity of the war is in the south, while the north is mostly small battles. The biggest disadvantage for Russia is that the two war zones in the north and south are far apart, reaching 1,100 kilometers. It is extremely difficult to coordinate them. If they hope to occupy them in one go, it will be difficult without a great sacrifice. The second is snow. The southern battlefield is full of lakes. Finland, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," if it is mobilizing troops to defend against foreign enemies, the lake water is indeed a natural moat. Now that the ice is frozen in winter, the Russian heavy artillery vehicles could have crossed the lake in large numbers and avoided sinking, but in the end they could not, because the heavy snow blocked them. The days with shorter snow accumulation are said to be in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, which is located in the south. Each year, there are about 130 days of snow that does not melt. In the center of Lapland in the north, there can be 200 days of snow that does not melt. Furthermore, the Finnish army's clothes and military vehicles are all white, which is very easy to hide in the snow. The third is suffering from the long polar night, which has not seen the light of day for a long time. Finland is located in the far north. The shortest day in the south, at Koito, passes quickly under the dim shroud of only a few hours. At 66 degrees 33 minutes north latitude in the north is the Arctic Circle, where there should be a long night of perpetual darkness on one day of the year. If you go further north and deep into the Arctic Circle to 70 degrees north latitude, there will be a long night of 61 days without seeing the light of day within a year. The Russian army's night operations are particularly difficult due to the unfamiliarity of the people and the place. For example, the Petsamo port corridor area, which Russia is fighting for, is between 68 and 70 degrees north latitude, and has now become a black night that is difficult to deal with. The fourth is cold. Within the Arctic Circle, when fighting in the snow at night, all mechanized units mostly lose their effectiveness. Anyone who fights, if they are not as proficient in skiing as the Finns, they will have no way to win by surprise. Machines in cold areas prevent oil from freezing, and even if soldiers are covered in heavy fur coats, they are still afraid of freezing to death. If commentators judge based on the above four points, then Russia's lack of heavenly timing is indeed one of its most obvious weaknesses.</p>
<p>In addition, the Finnish people's skillful use of tricks in ground warfare also seems to be worth mentioning. The Finns are good hunters. They carry short darts called Kuku (up to 15 cm long), are quick to throw them, and can find their way out of the silent and dark forests like the Red Indians of North America. This is a sporting event that the Boy Scouts are good at. Now, when it is applied to the long nights of heavy snow in Northern Europe, the locals are familiar with the road, which is the most advantageous. The Russian soldiers who entered Finland are afraid to enter the forest and prefer to rush across the frozen lake. However, the lake surface has very little shade. For example, in a certain place, when a large number of Russian soldiers rushed across the lake, a Finnish soldier suddenly hid with a machine gun and fired 45 consecutive shots when they got close, killing 41 Russian soldiers in one fell swoop. This kind of tactic, using the few to defeat the many, is to use the latest mechanical devices supplemented by the oldest methods of the Indians, which is truly a pioneering effort.</p>
<h3>Japan's Drought: Drought Year Unseen in Sixty-Six Years: Tokyo's Drinking Water Has Become a Problem</h3>
<p>-- Hui</p>
<p>Japan had a poor grain harvest last year, causing a rice shortage. Since winter, the north has been hit by storms and snow, destroying most of the crops. The south has been suffering from drought for three or four months. In some places, even drinking water has become a problem. Following the drought is a terrible fire. On the 15th of last month, a fire burned down most of Shizuoka City, causing property losses of 80 million Japanese yen, which is also because the water sources in the suburbs of Shizuoka have dried up and the fire brigade cannot put out the fire.</p>
<p>Such a dry situation has never happened in Japan in previous years. No wonder Japanese newspapers have to use extremely painful headlines: "The sky is ruthless, giving Japan the white devil (referring to wind and snow - reporter's note) and drought."</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on January 30, this year is the first winter with constant sunshine in 66 years since Japan had a meteorological observatory. Therefore, water in Tokyo will become the most serious problem in the next month or two. Not only will the 5.5 million residents have to worry about the source of drinking water, but also because the climate is dry, it is very easy to cause fires. The lack of air humidity is more likely to cause epidemics such as pneumonia and diphtheria. From this point of view, if there is no heavy rain or heavy snow in the near future, the disasters in the Tokyo area will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>To what extent has Japan's drought reached this year? We had better use simple numbers to indicate. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the average rainfall in Japan in December in previous years was 60 cm, and the rainfall in January was 50 cm. However, this winter's December only received 9.8 cm of rainfall, and the rainfall in January was zero, because it did not rain at all. According to the Japanese Meteorological Agency's national climate forecast at the end of last month, it will definitely not rain near Tokyo in at least the next four or five days, and even after five days, it is still very slim!</p>
<p>Tokyo residents are unanimously looking forward to:</p>
<p>"When will a drop of nectar finally fall?"</p>
<p>A Corner of the Battlefield</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan in the Flames of War</h3>
<p>-- Ju</p>
<p>According to military observers, the Japanese army occupied Xiaoshan but did not invade Shaoxing. This is the application of the "bridgehead position" invented by Napoleon, that is, the two armies face each other, and a part of the troops cross the river to harass the enemy's shore, build fortifications, and contain its troops. However, according to the author's humble opinion, there is another reason, that is, the Japanese army installed artillery positions on the mountains of Jianggan, Hangzhou, and Xiaoshan is within its range. Before the Qiantang River Bridge was repaired, mechanized troops could not go over in a steady stream. If they disregarded their lives and went deep, running out of the range of the artillery, they would become turtles in a jar.</p>
<p>Speaking of Xiaoshan, it is really not a strategically important place. It had been bombed many times before, and it had become scorched earth. This time, it has been through a tug-of-war, so of course there is nothing left. The author went to Xiaoshan twice before the war. He visited Zhongshan Park. Although the area was small, it was still elegant, but now I think it is desolate.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan produces bayberries, which are quite famous, but there are many dirty public toilets, so you have to hold your nose to pass. Before the completion of the Shao-Xiao Highway (now in ruins), goods sent from Shanghai to Hangzhou to eastern Zhejiang were all transported by Xiaoshan people across the river and unloaded at Xixing for distribution to various places.</p>
<p>I think readers have not forgotten that more than ten years ago, Mr. Shen Dingyi (courtesy name Xuanying) was engaged in a peasant movement there, and was assassinated because of this. He likes to recite the following poem about lime: "Thousand hammers and chisels come out of the deep mountains, the fierce fire roars to open; I do not care about breaking bones and crushing my body, I only leave purity in the world." Not only should the Xiao Shan people who died later be familiar with this poem, but everyone is worth remembering it.</p>
<p>Scientific Common Sense</p>
<h3>Aluminum...An Essential Raw Material for Modern Industry</h3>
<p>The Steel Essence Exhibition Has Great Educational Significance</p>
<p>Industrialists Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Hua Aluminum Steel Essence Factory is holding a Steel Essence Exhibition at the Xin Xin Company's fourth floor on Nanjing Road. It opened a few days ago. The reporter believes that aluminum is an essential raw material for modern industry, and this move by the factory has great educational significance and is also of great importance to industrial development. Therefore, I made a special trip to visit and was received and explained by Mr. Tan Leishi of the factory. I was deeply interested. I will summarize what I saw as follows. The exhibition is currently continuing, and people from all walks of life, especially those who are interested in industry, should visit as soon as possible to gain a deeper understanding of aluminum, which is essential for modern industry.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the exhibition, as soon as I stepped out of the elevator, I immediately felt a silvery brilliance and dazzling light. The walls of the hall were made of steel essence, magnificent and beautiful. No wonder it is favored by modern builders. The four walls of the venue were hung with "double happiness," "longevity," congratulatory banners, and couplets. At first glance, they looked like ordinary silk products, but they shone brightly and were extraordinarily gorgeous. Upon closer inspection, I realized that they were also made of steel essence. In addition to various sizes and thicknesses of aluminum sheets produced by the factory, such as flat sheets, rolled sheets, round sheets, and round aluminum foil, which were all on display, various aluminum products and daily utensils, as well as electrical appliances, aircraft materials, etc., were all displayed in separate sections, and the order was well maintained. There were also several aluminum sheet embossing machines and concave-convex color printing machines in the venue, with specialists assigned to work on the spot. The products were passed around for the guests to view, and everyone praised them. Among the exhibits, the most eye-catching were the carburetors of the Master Special Automobile, the bodies and seats of public buses, and the aluminum packaging used for various well-known brands, aircraft models, and dyed aluminum products. The light weight, high strength, ease of use, non-rusting, and ductility of aluminum were fully demonstrated by these products. As for the various charts, they were all clear and detailed, allowing the audience to understand the uses and characteristics of aluminum at a glance. Aluminum has a wide range of uses. The most prominent are in the transportation industry, military supplies, household goods, packaging industry, food industry, chemical industry, textile industry, electrical industry, printing industry, and architectural decoration. By making full use of aluminum products, costs can be reduced, and the goal of durability can be achieved.</p>
<p>World Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Bartering in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>Bartering was originally a method of exchanging goods before the existence of currency. Later, with the evolution of society, people used money as a medium, and this original system of bartering has been largely forgotten. Unexpectedly, this system has now been retained in the art world.</p>
<p>Recently in Paris, works of art worth 100,000 gold yuan were exchanged without any money. The intermediary objects used were shoes, cars, wine, and even surgery.</p>
<p>In the cow shed-like buildings of the exhibition park next to the Versailles gate, the Exchange Salon (Salon des Exchanges) was held for two months. Modern painters Osterlind and Rtmey received enough new shoes for twenty years of use each. Rokline also got many hats, and he doesn't have to worry about this issue in the future. SH. Morean was the luckiest, he got a car.</p>
<p>Other things exchanged for works of art were: a doctor providing medical advice to artists throughout the year, surgery, precious Chinese embroidery, and life insurance, etc. An American painter, Ary Stillman, was promised free consumption of champagne at a Montmartre cafe anytime he and his friends wanted, but he did not accept this offer.</p>
<h3>Records of Small Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Tailong</p>
<p>A hippopotamus's stomach is eleven feet long.</p>
<p>On average, insects can pull loads more than twenty times their own body weight.</p>
<p>In spring and summer, the feathers of the northern grouse are greenish-blue, but in winter, their feathers turn white. The same is true for arctic hares.</p>
<p>An elephant's lifespan is three times the average human lifespan, that is, 150 years. The lifespan of a large spider is 10 to 15 years.</p>

<h3>How to Improve Your Studies</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>School has been in session for several days, and the children have started their happy group life again. But time flies, and in the blink of an eye, it will be time for small and big exams. To avoid being anxious and regretful in the future, let's start working hard from today!</p>
<p>After monthly or semester exams, report cards often bring unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Some children wonder, "Didn't I work just as hard as that classmate? Why are their grades better than mine?" Or, "Someone doesn't seem to study, yet they don't fail any subjects." Then they blame the teacher for being biased, without examining whether their own study methods are ineffective or whether they only cram before exams. Therefore, if we are not studying for grades, not studying because the teacher is forcing us, then to improve our studies and get good grades, we should pay attention to the following three points:</p>
<p>1.  Preparation: We prepare for everything we do. Even tiny ants are busy preparing food for the winter in spring, summer, and autumn. So, we must also prepare for studying. For example, read a new lesson once before each class, and mark the places you don't understand so you can ask questions. If you do this, you won't be completely clueless about what the teacher is talking about in class.</p>
<p>2.  Listening and Asking: In class, don't talk to classmates, don't think about other things, don't look at the scenery outside. Listen and think about the teacher's explanations and the classmates' questions, without neglecting anything. If you encounter difficulties, don't be ashamed to ask, and ask until you understand.</p>
<p>3.  Review: After class, set aside a few hours to do each subject, don't be lazy, don't copy. You should also know the main points of textbooks that the teacher hasn't assigned and remember them firmly.</p>
<p>Preparing in advance allows us to know the outline of a new lesson. Listening and asking solves previous difficulties. Then, review it and remember it firmly in your mind. Then, when you encounter exams, you can review it easily and cope with it easily. You won't feel physical or mental distress.</p>
<p>Little friends! If you want good grades this semester, hurry up and do it!</p>
<h3>Parachute</h3>
<p>— Junpeng</p>
<p>Children! Do you know what this "parachute" is? Maybe you don't know yet! So, I'll talk about it casually here.</p>
<p>What is a "parachute"? It is used to save the lives of flight personnel. When an aircraft's engine fails, flight personnel can float down from tens of thousands of feet in the air. So, its only purpose is to save lives, and it is also called a "safety parachute" or an "insurance parachute." The reason why it is called a "parachute" is simply because its shape resembles an "umbrella" when it is used in the air. It is indeed a powerful tool in the aviation world, especially during aerial combat. If the aircraft you are riding in is hit by the opponent, the aircraft will definitely crash, and your life will be in danger. If the aircraft suddenly catches fire in mid-air, you will definitely "be buried in flames"! Now, with a "safety parachute," you don't have to worry about any danger! At most, you will land in enemy territory as a prisoner.</p>
<p>The "parachute" was invented by a Frenchman named "Chunxi" in 1495 AD. His initial motivation for inventing it was not to use it as a tool for air insurance, but specifically to lower objects from high places to low places or to transport goods. Later, with the development of the aviation industry, it was valued and regarded as the only aerial life-saving tool. We should know that once an aircraft has flown to several thousand feet or more, if the engine stops, the circuit is on fire, the cylinder explodes, or other unexpected obstacles occur, at that moment of life and death, flight personnel can calmly jump down and land safely on the ground. Therefore, in times of war between two sides, the safety of the air force is extremely important. It can be said that the "parachute" is a life-saving "amulet." Do you find it strange? Why doesn't a person fall to their death when they fall from a high altitude using a "parachute"? I'll tell you, people who can't swim sink when they fall into the water, but with a "life preserver," they will float on the surface. This is because water has "buoyancy." Air is like water in that it has "buoyancy," so aircraft can move as freely as ships in the water. Flight personnel also descend using a "parachute" because air has "buoyancy," allowing them to descend slowly to the ground. Naturally, people will not fall to their death. If you don't believe me, you can drop a large piece of paper from a window on the upper floor, and you will see that the paper floats in the air, slowly falling to the ground. This proves that air has "buoyancy." So, if you are unfortunate enough to have a fire at home, then you can quickly open an umbrella and jump out of the building with the umbrella. Your life will be saved. There are five types of "parachutes": (1) Seat-pack type, (2) Knee-pack type, (3) Straight-back type, (4) Curved-back type, (5) Quick-load type. The "seat-pack type" parachute has its pack used as a cushion, so that flight personnel do not suffer from the pain of carrying weight. It is the most common type of insurance parachute. The "knee-pack type" parachute is convenient for photographers, observers, machine gunners, etc. to use because there are no mechanical obstacles in front of their knees. The "straight-back type" parachute is specifically for people who ride in balloons or airships, allowing the person carrying the parachute to have freedom of movement and climbing. The "curved-back type" parachute has its pack made along the curve of the human back into a special backpack shape, and is suitable for open-cockpit aircraft. The "quick-load type" parachute is specially made and is usually hung inside the aircraft. In the event of danger, it is taken and worn, and the procedure is very simple.</p>
<h3>How to Prevent Glass Cups from Shattering?</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>Yong'er's mother took him to visit relatives, and on the way back, she bought several glass cups.</p>
<p>"Brother, Mom bought two kinds of beautiful glass cups, one thick and the other thin, and the prices are the same. I thought the thick ones were a better deal, what do you think?" Yong'er called out to Zong'er as soon as he stepped into the house. At the same time, his mother took a pot of boiling water and poured it into the thick one first. But before the boiling water had filled half the cup, there was a "crack" sound, and there was of course a crack on the glass cup. When she poured the water into the thin glass cup, it was fine and nothing happened. "How strange, the thick one is easier to shatter, brother, do you know why?" Yong'er was puzzled when he saw this unexpected phenomenon.</p>
<p>"The thicker the glass cup, the easier it is to shatter. You need to know that all objects expand when they are heated. The reason for this shattering is that the glass cup expands unevenly when it is heated. Think about it, when boiling water is poured into a thick glass cup, the water cannot immediately heat the walls of the cup. At first, only its inner layer is heated, and its outer wall is not yet hot. The inner layer expands immediately when heated, but the outer wall remains the same. Therefore, the inner layer exerts force to impact the outer wall, and the cup shatters. Thin glass cups can quickly heat up completely, quickly eliminate the uneven temperature inside and outside, and achieve complete expansion. You should also see that the bottom of this glass cup is also thin and easily shattered. If you want to prevent thick glass cups from breaking, there is also a way: when you pour boiling water into a thick glass cup, put a silver teaspoon in the cup beforehand, and the cup will not shatter. What is the reason for this? Because putting a silver spoon in it causes the heat of the boiling water in the cup to be transmitted, and the boiling water becomes less boiling, that is, it reduces the temperature in the cup, and the cup will not break. We can also use a copper spoon, but it is not as good as a silver spoon, because a silver spoon can transmit heat faster than other metals. This is because silver is the best conductor of heat. This can also be tested. The copper spoon in the cup of boiling water will not burn your fingers, but the silver spoon will." Zong'er explained it to his younger brother in detail, hoping that he could understand it thoroughly. After he finished this long speech, he showed it to him one by one, and it was really true. Therefore, Yong'er had a deeper impression in his mind.</p>
<h3>Strange Camel</h3>
<p>— Fang Xian</p>
<p>If we cover our noses with a handkerchief, we will feel very uncomfortable in a few minutes because we can't breathe easily. But the camel, which is called the "ship of the desert," can automatically close its nose for a long time.</p>
<p>When we pay attention to observing all things, there are really many things that are wonderfully incredible, like camels, which are born tools for transporting goods in the vast desert. Because the desert is often swept up by strong winds, filling the sky with sand, if the camel did not have such a nose, then grains of sand would definitely pour into its lungs. Do you think the lungs can tolerate the existence of grains of sand? Not only that, but the camel also has a natural water storage bag, so that it can trek long distances in the desert sea without a drop of water, just like a sea ship that crosses the ocean must load enough fresh water to sail.</p>
<p>The camel's water storage bag is actually not shaped like a bag, but a porous body. To put it more vividly, it is a bit like a sponge, because it can absorb a large amount of water. Before the camel embarks on its journey, it goes to the swamp and drinks its fill, filling its bag with water. This way, it can be fearless if it doesn't encounter a drop of water for several days.</p>
<p>What's more, its feet are also naturally made, with soles as large as a cattail leaf fan. Otherwise, they would be buried in the sand and unable to walk on the sand.</p>
<p>These are all characteristics that cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules do not have, so the camel is a natural "ship of the desert."</p>
<h3>Black Brothers (6)</h3>
<p>— Yimu</p>
<p>Mr. Southwest Wind did indeed put his words into action. Since he came back this time, he has never descended upon Baibao Valley again. What's especially bad is that not only did he not come himself, but he also notified his relatives and friends, such as the West Wind and others, to all disappear and not come. Therefore, throughout the year, there was no rain in the valley at all. Although the plains below were full of green, and there was harvest everywhere, the three brothers could not save the favor of Heaven. They had to give up their worthless property in disappointment and go to the cities on the plains to seek a new life. Their money was all gone, leaving only a few old-fashioned gold plates, which were the last of their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>They entered the big city. Xihua said to Hans, "Let's change our profession and become goldsmiths. This industry is very easy to do tricks and deceive people; in any gold ware you make, you can mix in a large amount of brass, and no one will be able to see it." Hans agreed with this, so they rented a stove and decided to become goldsmiths. But they did not make much money after they started working. For one thing, customers did not like their copper-mixed gold wares, and for another, after the two brothers accidentally sold something, they would call Gele to guard the stove and go to the Sibi Hotel to drink, spending all the money they earned.</p>
<p>After they had melted all the gold in the furnace, they had no money to buy more. In the end, there was only a large gold cup for drinking, which their uncle had given to little Gele in the past. Although Gele did not drink alcohol, but only drank some water and milk from this cup, he cherished it very much because it was a souvenir from his uncle, and he was unwilling to part with it no matter what. The shape of this cup was very strange. The handle was made of two gold thread-like loops, which were made very delicately, looking like real silk instead of metal. Going down from these two gold thread loops were the mustaches, which were also made just as delicately, surrounding a very fierce-looking little human face in the center. The material was a kind of very red gold, and a pair of eyes were inlaid on it, clearly the focal point of the entire cup. Whenever he held up the cup to drink water or alcohol, he could not help but take a look at this pair of brightly shining eyes. Xihua was most afraid of this, because once, after he had finished drinking alcohol, he saw this pair of eyes staring at him.</p>
<p>When the two brothers saw that all the gold was gone, they soon wanted to melt the gold cup back into teaspoons. This almost broke Gele's heart, because it was his only treasure. But his two brothers still sneered at him, reached out and grabbed the cup and threw it into the furnace, and went to the hotel to drink on their own. Poor little Gele was still guarding the stove as usual, preparing to take the first step in turning the gold into strips.</p>
<p>After the two brothers left, little Gele sadly took one last look at the treasure in the pot. The two loops of gold thread had already melted, leaving only a red nose and a pair of bright eyes, which were even more terrifying than usual. Gele thought to himself, "It's no wonder, we treat it so ruthlessly, it's only natural that it would resent us." While thinking, he uneasily walked to the window, avoiding the heat from the stove, wanting to absorb some fresh and cool night air.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Theater Movement During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>A newspaper in Boston, USA, recently published a Chongqing dispatch entitled "The Chinese Theater Movement During Wartime," which records news about theater in mainland China. I will summarize it as follows: In the two and a half years since the outbreak of the war, various Chinese theater groups have been established one after another, numbering about one hundred. Currently, in Chongqing alone, there are thirteen very active theater groups. In addition, there has been an amazing achievement in classical and contemporary plays in the past two years.</p>
<p>From Hong Shen, I (the original author) learned that: every division of the army has a theater troupe organization. They were established for two reasons: one is to provide soldiers with an opportunity for entertainment, and the other is to encourage their courage and enthusiasm. At the same time, they can also gain a lot of knowledge about the war. In addition to these groups, I also saw that there are countless so-called mobile theater troupes that are dispatched by the authorities. Their mission is to supplement the shortcomings of the former, so that places without fixed theater group organizations can also have the opportunity to see performances of heroic and tragic stories. Their audience, of course, is mostly soldiers, but there are also many ordinary people.</p>
<p>About 5% of the actors in each theater troupe can be said to be very popular movie stars in the past, 40% of them were amateur theater actors in the past, and the rest, which can also be considered the largest majority, are mostly young people who have just started their theater lives.</p>
<p>At first, the plays performed were very simple. Their purpose was to awaken the general public and soldiers to the knowledge of the war. "Now," Mr. Hong Shen told me, "our harvest is quite amazing. The current plays are much more complex and sophisticated than in the past..."</p>
<p>Recently staged plays include (1) Three Heroes, (2) Crossing the Yellow River, (3) A Pack of Foxes and Dogs, etc. In these plays, whether it is the scenery, sound, props, or lighting, all are extremely beautiful, and the performance results are, of course, very successful.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that education is not widespread in China, so the influence of newspapers and magazines on people can be said to be very small. We should use the power of theater to instill various kinds of knowledge. The need for theater among Chinese people can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Wang Xianqi's "One Family, Three Talents"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Lu Ming, Chen Kengran, and Xu Qinfang were called the "One Family, Three Talents" of the film industry. Now they are making movies in Hong Kong for the Nanyue Company, so the "One Family, Three Talents" label has faded away in the newspapers. Because it was a familiar idiom. Recently, the four words "One Family, Three Talents" were quickly added to Wang Xianqi's name.</p>
<p>When Wang Xianqi returned to Shanghai from Sichuan last year, he also brought a new wife with him. She was Yuan Zhuru, a former colleague at the Mingxing Company. This magazine has published an interview with them. So, is the reason for being called "One Family, Three Talents" because Yuan Zhuru also has a younger sister? No! It turns out that Shen Hao, who played Li Shiniang in "Ge Nenniang," was too busy with rehearsals for "Niehai Hua," and it was too much work to perform day and night. So, another lady was asked to take the role of Li Shiniang. That lady's name is Wang Wei, and she has performed in plays such as "Di Shiniang" at the YMCA. Everyone was very satisfied with the invitation to play Li Shiniang this time, especially the Empress Dowager Cixi, the "playwright Wei Ruhui," greatly appreciated her and even intended to invite her to play Consort Zhen in "Empress Dowager Cixi."</p>
<p>Although Wang Wei's name is very unfamiliar, she is already a very familiar actor backstage at the Jijiang Palace. It turns out that she is Wang Xianqi's eldest daughter. Coincidentally, Wang Xianqi and Yuan Zhuru are both making guest appearances as Zheng Zhilong and Tian Shi in "Ge Nenniang," so the four words "One Family, Three Talents" were added to Wang Xianqi's name. (The above is a photo of Miss Wang Wei in the play "Di Shiniang")</p>
<p>Movie Story</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Pinocchio</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ivan</p>
<p>The End of Naughty Children</p>
<p>One day, Pinocchio and Candlewick were rowing a small boat, drifting along the Lemon River. Candlewick suggested going to Tobacco Road for some new excitement, so they abandoned the boat and went ashore. The ground there was covered with tobacco and matches, and the fences were made of cigars. Candlewick nonchalantly took a cigar, smoked it, and even encouraged Pinocchio to pick a big one and smoke it. Just then, Jiminy Cricket arrived. Seeing Pinocchio smoking, he was very sad! So he shouted loudly, "I never knew you were so depraved—go home!"</p>
<p>Candlewick was very surprised and asked Pinocchio what this thing was. Pinocchio casually glanced at the cricket and said, "He is my 'conscience'." "Do you listen to this little bug? " Candlewick turned around and walked away, saying, "I'm not with you anymore." The little puppet complained about Jiminy a few times and turned around to catch up, shouting, "Wait a minute, Candlewick! I'm coming!"</p>
<p>Now only the annoyed Jiminy Cricket was left. The fairy swore not to care about the puppet anymore, so he headed towards the dock. But today was really strange. The dark Pleasure Island was gloomy and not a single child could be found. Where did they all go? Approaching the dock, he was shocked. The little cricket saw many donkeys gathered there, some with children's shoes still on their feet! Beside them, fierce drivers and guards with guns patrolled back and forth, constantly whipping the poor donkeys. It turned out that this was the dark side of Pleasure Island, and those donkeys were the fate of these lazy, naughty children. The loyal little cricket hurried towards Tobacco Road, he was going to save Pinocchio.</p>
<p>Oh heavens, it was too late! A pair of furry, long ears had already grown on the puppet's head, and a donkey's tail was dragging behind him. At this time, seeing Jiminy, he didn't even have time to speak, so he fled. The alarm bell rang, searchlights shone in all directions, and guard dogs, guards, and drivers were chasing after these fugitives. Poor Candlewick (now he had turned into a little donkey) was caught. The puppet and Jiminy were fortunate enough to jump into the sea, they were saved. (7)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>It Is Not Appropriate for Female Performers to Sing "Yutang Chun" During Periods</p>
<p>The aforementioned operas are indeed considered important works for Qingyi performers, but they are still much better than the currently popular Huashan opera "Yutang Chun," because those operas still leave some covering of the hands and feet with skirts and water sleeves. "Yutang Chun," however, features Su San wearing a convict's garment, holding an iron chain hanging around her neck, and kneeling at the front of the stage for more than four quarters of an hour, singing continuously without stopping in between. Although it is now said that wealthy performers can buy some down or the most expensive cashmere shirts to wear close to the body so that they don't look bloated, and they also have their own thick cotton pads to prevent their knees from suffering, it is still less comfortable to kneel than to stand or sit. If this were a male performer, he could take a sip during the intermission when pulling over the door curtain (the stage assistant or attendant hands tea to the performer, saying "take a sip"), but female performers cannot drink too much, nor can they not drink at all. When it comes to performing a high-pitched opera the next day, reputation is at stake, and the voice must be resonant. The more you want to make your voice round and clear, the more tea you have to drink. The effort above is too much, but the menstruation below cannot be stopped. In the winter season, whether male or female, the colder it is, the more frequent the urination, which is known to everyone. I still remember a joke where many men and women were on a boat crossing a river, and the weather was extremely cold. These women were all whispering to each other, worried about how to urinate. Two bad boys on the boat pretended to joke. One said, "If you need to urinate urgently, just touch your nostrils and sneeze, and it will be fine." These women all listened and tried it, only to find that they had all peed in their pants. It can be seen that men can endure for a moment, but women cannot stop it the more they try. The first day of performing on stage is originally to seek good luck, and there are many taboos in opera troupes. If there is something newly broken, encountering a dirty object on stage is very unlucky. Our country's theaters have never paid attention to cold and heat air conditioning equipment, they exist in name only. They have never thought about the suffering of the performers. In fact, placing two electric heaters at the front of the stage when performing this play would not be a big deal, but they only want to save trouble and money. Who would care about these miscellaneous accounts? (183)</p>
