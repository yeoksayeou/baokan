<p>重慶　中國當局對於星期五日緬甸公路之重行開放、雖加以極大之重視、但是日將未必有動人之官方儀式、或有大批卡車通過該路、外傳星期五日將有卡車二三千輛越過邊境之說、大的近於幻想、因該路旣已開放、華方似無急於一時之必要、事實上中國當局將謹愼避免使大批卡車集中</p>

<p>東京　朝日新聞謂、美國與英合作對於遠東事件深入過甚、今已呈欲退而絕不可能之象、美政府之勸告遠東美僑撤退、此舉是吾表示美政府如有必要將與日本開戰、尚須靜待以觀之、美政府之對日似已陷於兩難之中、卽（一）須與日本完全斷絕經濟關係、或如有必要擬訴諸武力、以維持東亞之現狀、果爾、對英之援助必將大减而特减、（二）不能容許大西洋爲第三國所控制、故必須助英維持控制該洋之全權、朝日新聞相信、英國如在歐戰中獲勝則美國不難解決此二問題、但英國如果失敗、則美國將無能力取對日之攻勢、若干人士以爲、日·美斷絕經濟關係、大足制日、而亦有人以爲、此舉足以鼓勵日政府之南進政策、而臻於兩國開戰之程度、但無論如何、今日兩國間之貿易關係、或可認爲處「半戰爭狀態中、兩國間之貿易關係、敢本因此之故、幾已不能以日貨運至美國而易得外幣矣、英國重啟緬甸公路之行動、已增加對重慶政府之援助、英·美兩國間且以各種策略拉攏蘇聯、凡此皆爲四日·德·義三國締結互助公的之報復計畫也、英國苟非對歐戰已有勝利之把握、且苟非獲得美國充分軍事援助之諾言、俾兩國處同等地步以戰日本、則伏不致放棄對日之綏靖政策、此爲顯而易見者云、（十六日路透電</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>新政運動下得日本政局</h3>
<p>近衛之重膺政權，到現在恰滿三個月，在此期內，他的政治抱負，頗有發抒；更以頑强的姿態從事於重大國際胃險。固然，日本企圖獨霸東亞的南進政策，及與德義締結三國同盟，都在已往歷史上有其淵源，並非從此度近衛捲土重來纔開始醞釀；但近衛之所以不同於其遲徊審愼的歷屆前任，而把前任所不敢冒昧採用的冒險政策一一付之實施者，除却國際局勢激盪影響而外，無疑的更因爲他另外挾有新政體制運動，亦即最近改稱之大政翼贊運動，爲之後盾。在他的理想，大槪認爲通過此一運動即可使日本一切都走上極權主義的範疇；以統一了的政治指導力，統制着經濟政治軍事以至社會各階層和全體國民；滿以爲日本即不難由此而建設高度國防國家，與德義媲美，俾從事於全世界的再分割。關於極權制度的得失，吾們現在不願加以批評；但在日本革新人物，則已認此爲唯一出路；其對德義之亦步亦趨，殆無異於七十年前之憧憬西歐的自由和民治。</p>
<p>檢討事跡，日本這决改變政制與對外行動二者發生的順序，却並小與革新分子的理想相符合；在德義都是極權制度業已相當鞏固且獲有成就之後，纔開始向外擴展；而今日的日本，則在對外冒險已臨絕境之際，纔準備以改變政制解救艱困。而且改制運動甫在萌芽，遽爾加速厲行其對外的冒險行動，相形之下，一方面如牛步蝸行，一方面則風追電掣；如果後者的遂行是要以前者的成效爲張本，則未熟先摘，越級躐進，誠不知近衛等將何以調劑其間，何從相互湊合？而日本實力的空虛孱弱，支離恍惚，却又因此一罅隙而益爲世人所洞見。</p>
<p>近衛的新政運動雖遠起此度執掌政權之前，其根源且當遠溯之一九三六年冬的荻窪會議；但這一運動的形態和具體運用，却至今仍在蒙味階段；其所成就者，亦僅幾經蛻變纔得實現的上層組織陣容。最初，近衛所用以號召者是新黨運動，到新政體制準備委員會成立之後，組黨意味即漸見薄弱；近衛甚且鄭重表示其雖具有高度政治性，但却並非政黨，個中道理，已令人難於索解。及至大政翼贊會代替新政籌備會而正式成立，則所謂新政體制者，又似乎並不表示政制本身的改革，而僅屬「協助君上處理國務」的性質（見九月十三日籌備會所通過要綱）。同時所謂翼贊會組織，雖號稱全國國民均應參加，但却又僅由政府自上而下的任命幹部，與人民全不相干；雖於其下的第三四層决，設有國民協力會議，作爲下情上達的機關，而主持之者，却又屬之彰著之右翼巨頭末决信正，任爲會長。照這樣一個支離奇特的機構，如果說便可以担負日本目前艱局的重任，並使其媲美德義，那眞是不能想像的未來的奇跡了。</p>
<p>即以大政翼贊會本身而論，更另有其先天的弱點：第一，所謂統一指導力者當然首先要能指揮軍部，現在東條雖允以陸省三首腦代表參加此項運動，現役軍人則槪不加入；海軍方面態度亦大致相同；這顯然表示軍部之不肯屈身就範，以促成統帥權與政治的統一。現在大政翼贊會甫告成立，軍部喉舌的國民新聞已在攻擊其成立過程中「人選競爭之劇烈爲出盡天下醜態」，並嚴重指摘近衛對舊勢力的妥協，則此後軍部對於此一運動意態如何自不難預想。第二，所謂建立高度國防的中心意義，其主要在經濟方面；據九月十九日準備會所決定的基本方針，是妥集農工商業於一堂，創設生產分配消費三者連爲一氣之新制度，並以協同組合爲基礎，將所有大中小工業均融合於同一系統之下；這一目標，誠然高遠得驚人，但不知其所謂創設及融合將如何具體進行，纔能克服經濟界的重大阻力以及日本產業界頑强的封建性？關於這一點，至今尚無隻字述及。第三，所謂大政翼贊會的中樞人選，軍部縱然攻擊其過分遷就舊勢力與舊式政治運動者，而革新人物則幾已毫無遺漏的包括在內：其綱羅之富，殆已煞費苦心；但其所成就的却只有物理現象的混合，而缺乏化學作用的融冶；結果只見其龐雜矛盾，調協爲難，而毫不能收到融匯統一的功效。此外有如規定大政翼贊會的會長即由首相兼任，那更將使日本政局失掉彈性的調劑，如果小幸再度發生政潮，眞令人無從想像其將如何演變以善其後。</p>
<p>所謂革新運動，在日本原無深厚基礎，其動力小過十之二三出於自發，十之七八則由於外鑠。故新政運動的最近情狀，雖在表面上非不活躍；但冷觀保守陣營，與其說是銷聲匿跡，到無寧在沉機觀變。原則上新政之　吾促進對外冒險有所成就，旣已大成問題，假如一旦其對外行動受到重大挫折，或者軸心國家遭受敗衂，則一定會在日本政局演變上另劃一個新的時代。</p>

<p>美僑開會　從事準備</p>
<p>本埠美國僑民聯合會及美國商會等所組之委員會、昨日中午、在福州路美國總會舉行會議、對於撤退本埠美僑之計劃、作初步之研究、會議之詳情、雖未獲悉、但據悉會議中對於此間美僑返美之川資與載運等辦法、均曾加以討論、同時並悉美國商會之職員及會員等、均在竭力設法、使願意離滬之美僑、獲得船票减費之辦法、</p>
<p>續來兩輪　噸位亦鉅</p>
<p>美政府擬撤離遠東僑民派定曼哈丹華盛頓號兩巨輪、赴遠東各地載運、聞兩巨輪的週內檢騐畢、即起程東來、茲悉美政府又繼兩巨輪後、續徵馬遜輪船公司（Matson）馬列波陸（S.S.Mariposa）號蒙德萊（S.S.Monterey）號兩大郵船來遠東載僑、該兩郵船原行駛舊金山至澳洲航綫、由舊金山或洛杉磯經檀香山·巴哥巴哥（Pagopago）·蘇瓦（Suva）·奧克蘭（Aucklaud）、至澳洲雪梨（Sydney）、載重一萬九千噸、船長六百三十二呎、闊七十九尺、速率每小時二十二海哩以上、兩輪相同、較日本皇后郵船略小、內部設備、如大餐問、休息室·健身房·游泳池·升降梯·檯甲·網球塲等、應有盡有、富麗堂皇、客位頭二三等可容七百餘人、爲美澳綫手屈一指之郵船、該公司之遠東代理、前由昌興公司承辦、將來撤退僑民之進出口手續、大的由美國總統輪船公司代理、惟該公司尚未奉總行電令、故昨日並無表示、</p>
<p>美輪規定　停泊四處</p>
<p>據此間美國總統郵船公司最高當局昨日對西報記者稱、自國務院發出勸令遠東美僑撤退之通知後、本埠美僑願意從速離滬而向該公司預定艙位之申請書、已逮的三千件云、據目下一般之意見、認爲本埠美僑將離滬返國者、恐猶不止此數、馬遜輪船公司、郵船被遣來滬載美僑撤退之正式通知、此間美總領事署昨已接到、但據美代理總領事布德立稱、關於撤退事宜之繼續消息、尚無所聞、至供撒退僑民用叫郵船、其所經口岸爲橫濱·神戶·香港·上海、其他口岸在必要時、再行增加、</p>
<p>本市英僑　暫不撤退</p>
<p>自本市美僑積極進行撤退後、因最近英美兩國在太平洋之合作關係、致英僑撒退與吾、外間頗多揣測、大中社記者昨訪英國關係富局、據稱、英僑撤退、英當局迄今尚無命令、故撤僑之舉、自不致實行云、又據記者探悉、本市一般英僑自美僑進行撤退後、情緒方面不無緊張、但一般情形、尚稱安謐、雖有少數英僑、志願從軍、爲國效力、但大部英僑、經營商業、一如往昔、現遠東局勢顯已日形惡化、但離滬他往之英僑、則尚不多見、</p>
<p>日方諱言　時局眞相</p>

<h3>遊資內移　可獲厚利　法幣八百五十元　滙渝可收一千元</h3>
<p>探悉、至廿九年上半年度截止、上海各銀行滙往內地之游資已逾廿五萬萬元、其由商號及私人方面、滙往者尚不在內、以前流通滬市之華北及漢口地名之鈔票、自三行准滙入內地十足通用後、該項鈔票、今已流入內地、又各銀行存款日增、自民國二十七年春以迄日前爲止、各銀行存款、估計總的三十萬萬元、在全國銀行存款總額的佔百分之四十以上、是項存款活期的佔百分之七十、現國府對此項游資已決定優待內移以示提倡、照昨日行市、上海付法幣八百五十元、得在重慶收取法幣一千元、但各銀行錢莊之貼費內滙折扣並不釗一、聞有若干商號貼費更大、其信用如何、不得而知、</p>
<h3>工部局與日方討論　解除本市米荒　外幣滙率及運費等不定　民食不能過分依賴洋米</h3>
<p>字林報云、工部局某數官員、昨（十五日）與上海日軍當局舉行非正式討論、以期謀取合作、而解本市米荒、聞工部局官員請求日軍當局放國米通行、以應此間亟需、日軍當局則謂彼等將</p>
<p>調查此事</p>
<p>以便決定能取何行動、據工部局物價調查處某員昨日午後聲稱、運抵上海之國米、遠較所需之量爲低、大量廉價國米、立卽運到、爲解決米糧問題之唯一辦法、現產米區在日方控制下、希望兩日前所開始之討論、能獲具體結果、至少許放若干米糧來滬、以應需要、渠已與日方聯絡員一人數度舉行非正式談話、而昨晨復向日方聯絡員</p>
<p>談及米况</p>
<p>該員以日軍高級當局將考慮此事爲官、由於滙市不定、外幣價高、而運費等等莫不昂貴、勢必影響米價、故華籍居民、不能過份依恃洋米、該昌末稱、法幣滙價近見好轉、例如美元於上月間跌落五分之一、然據所接報告觀之、物價並無减低者、蓋公共租界內並未充制物價故也、又</p>
<p>洋米利潤</p>
<p>評價委員會議訂後、頗博得全市中外居民之贊同、昨有市民某建議云、該會此種措置、尚屬合理、顧增加百分之五額外利潤、似乎過大、蓋洋米運滬、非隨到隨銷、皆囤儲米棧、候　價出籠、有者竟達半載有餘、是項囤米若亦給以百五利潤、照過去來價計算、其獲利殊匪淺鮮、同時、日前運抵洋米、給以百五利潤、其獲利當亦可觀、故望兩租界當局顧全平民生計、予以將該項額外利潤核减、</p>
<h3>經委會建議募補　核定警力　局勢失常罪案迭出　警務預算必須增加</h3>

<p>節減經費</p>
<p>一途、敢不竭智盡力、以圖有所貢獻、但就事實而言、警務上經費之節减、應以地方秩序恢復爲前提、現行警務處各部份組織、係根據一九二九年前任處長裘賴德之建議而定、卽所謂核定警力」是也、自是以還、因經費關係、警力逐年减削、减至所謂「預算警力」、本會鑒於目下租界情形、杌隍不定、作奸犯科、層出不窮、用是向局方作</p>
<p>下列建議</p>
<p>（一）外籍組底一二兩股以及印籍組、應儘速募補、以　「預算警力」之人數、（二）外籍組第一二兩股人數、按照上述「核定警力」、比「預算警力」應分別增出三十　人與十五人之數、此項缺額、應卽招募或提升華員以補充之、其職位應爲副捕頭或較高之等級、（三）印籍組按照「核定警力」、應增出六十七人、亦應提升低級華員以補充之、不足之數、並應設法募補、</p>
<p>維持治安</p>
<p>爲警務處之主要任務、第以維持治安之代價、無法低廉、故本會所提供之前項建議、倘付諸實施、必須增加預算、同時深信各納稅人、爲其本身利害着想、必樂予肩荷此額外負担也、關於商團俄國隊歸併警務處一節、其理由已詳見上次報告書、茲經警務處擬具改組警務處計劃書轉送到會、此項改組計劃、擬於俄國隊歸併之後實行之按照</p>
<p>改組計劃</p>
<p>警務人員之等級、擬分爲六種、計一等爲外籍主管長官、二等爲就地招募之外籍主管長官、三等爲華籍主管長官、四等爲俄國隊、五等爲印籍組、六等爲華籍組、上項計劃、倘能實現、則外籍組必預備具特種資格之人員、將來可望减少、同時經費每因此而較省、但人員可裁至何種程度、以及“前應吾裁汰、則本會此時間不能加以估計、本會對於前項計劃、表示贊同、擬請局方予一採納、但其實施之步驟、本會在現行狀况之下、未能詳細制定、而丁茲罪行層出不窮之時、情形錯綜複雜、似未許亟遽從事更張也、</p>

<h3>追念奧國精神病專家　華格納葉雷克教授（二）　瘋人全身麻痹症的克服者　韓芬著  夏楚譯</h3>
<p>所以好多年前，當心理分析學還給武斷的空想所混雜的時候，他是維也納另一個精神病專家弗洛依特的對頭。他爲人機警多智，對答敏捷，語中帶刺，他的對手常常弄得很窘。我們中還記得，有一决他照例在醫院裹巡視病房的時候，有一個瘋婦人正在講她的夢。一羣出名的心理分析學家在用心地聽，空氣顯得很嚴肅，可是華敎授來打擾了他們，他詼諧的問道：『關於這個，你們的女巫夢書怎麼說？』</p>
<p>他有幾個弟子，野心太大，歡喜多出版書，他亦常嘲笑這種科學研究的大量出產。那一天，我們得悉諾貝爾獎金已贈給了我們的七旬老師，院中同人和他關係較密切的都集起來慶祝。他很快的用這樣一句話來答謝：『我相信諸位當中一定也有人會得諾貝爾獎金，卽使得不着科學獎金，無論如何可以得個文學獎金。』幾天以後，他叉受人慶祝，他極力說得了「這樣一個諾貝爾獎金」之後，對於一個人的醫道大有裨益：『只要是我開給病人的，卽使是漢化劑也靈了。』</p>
<p>這位大研究象所發生興趣的科學問題是很多很多，可是他最大的成就乃是發明『瘧疾菌注射醫療法』，這使得他全球聞名，而且使他與醫學界最大權威齊名。</p>
<p>華格納葉雷克參加對梅毒螺旋體的鬥爭，完全未經預料到。『白色恐怖』作弄它的犧牲者，花樣百出，跟它搏鬥的科學家，最初巳是心灰意懶。鮑台脫（Bordet）和華塞曼（Wassermann）發明了梅毒傳染測騐法後三年，愛爾利虛（Ehrlich）發明了他醫治梅毒的魔彈—六〇六。可是六〇六還做得不徹底，單解除了病人外面的痛苦還不够。仍舊有數千萬人，大的佔梅毒患者的百分之十，雖然受了六〇六的醫療法，可是他們的神經系裏還藏着梅毒螺旋體。外表上看不出什麼，可是隔了或十年，或廿年，或卅年，這輩人的老毛病又要發作，全身都麻痺起來了。九一四，鉍劑。銾劑儘管多用，他們的脊髓液的華塞曼反應可還是正的，這足以證明螺旋體還活着，在等候着最後致命一擊的機會。</p>
<p>『全身麻痺症是無法醫治的，在數年之中，息者將全失知覺，而且要死亡。』這是在華格納葉雷克時代以前一般人關於這病症的意見。</p>
<p>在一八八七年，華氏就留心到有幾個麻痺病人如感受了一種傳染病，病情就會改進。華氏本很古怪，相信經騐甚於理論，可是現在他亦鑽進古書裹去，他讀到了半傳說半歷史的希臘希伯克拉底斯曾發現羊癲病人如生了瘧疾，癲癎病就會霍然而愈。從近代科學眼光看來，這些事只好算山海經，華氏若想從這些觀察上推出科學的結論，他必需要有勇氣，而且他必需要有天才，才會想出如何去有意模仿這自然的實騐。所以他提議對於一輩無望的瘋人，應該讓他們去傳染丹毒或是瘧疾。歐洲沒有一個人聽他，甚至沒有人反對他。</p>
<p>一八九〇年，華氏開始用丹毒來治療幾個精神病人，後來他又利用客赫（Koch）氏所發明的結核菌液（Tuberculin），全球震動。一九〇〇年，他得興趣又轉移到全身麻痹症的醫治上，有一部份這種病人，對於結核菌液有特別良好的反應。可是用道個法子醫好的病人，常常會舊病復發，而且他們的瘋在不是再用這方法所能制止的。（明日登完）</p>

<p>昨日特別榮譽座券開始競購時、住居北京路宏興里十號李老太太、首先電告袁履登氏、表示願以二百元承購此第一號券、如另有人競購、則請袁氏派員再行告知、不久之後、又有一朱先生（自願隱名）及張承貽兩君、亦願以同價値承購、惟未有超出所規定之標準價二百元數字、大概係誤爲每券二百元、而未注意及競爭之故、故今日特繼　舉行、以期各界之踴躍競購、按李老太太卽上週以一千一百元購球之實業鉅子李衡齋氏之太夫人、</p>
<p>電話號碼　稍生波折</p>

<p>滬靑改期　不致實現</p>
<p>關於滬靑要求改期問題、據該隊教練錢旭滄君表示、滬靑確因陳學崇之赴港未返、大貓及任相成之因病或傷、故有要求改期之表示、惟昨日相成之上海病、已稍痊可、如今日小再發高熱、則休養一二日後、當可出塲、大貓傷勢、一二日內當可望愈、學崇係上星期二赴港、的期一星期返滬、故亦有如期趕到可能、總之爲慈善事業、勝負在所不計、故正竭力設法、務使不致改期也、</p>

<h3>紗花　港胃已飽　紗布突降　雙馬回落卅元</h3>
<p>上日在升猛落之紗市、昨則轉趨下降、此因香港　連日辦去之貨、爲額殊鉅、目前似有飽滿之象、容待消化後再當添辦、因此有一部份多頭紛紛出籠、市態軟化、惟大戶某某仍在吸收中、不過價盤已入高檔、一遇不良環境、反動恐劇也、所以前昨兩日之走勢、已見混亂不一、而瞬刻千變、可想買空賣空、捉摸不定、今日有棉紗三千五百九十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、一致熱烈之氣、仍不减退、多頭之汹焰　　、首盤價爲一千二百五十元、漢十元、但廣幫因實需不旺、套出廠單雙馬、少頃微跌至一千一百四十元、然多頭拉提極盛、又漲至一千二百四十六七元、在此四十元至四十七元之間、往返不下有二個鐘點以外、可想多空爭持之烈、時近十一可、聞藍鳳標紗下跌、而日紗亦軟弱、於是大勢旣去、多頭無　做作、市盤乃徐徐下落、直瀉到一千二百十八元、收盤價爲一千二百二十二元、查半日間成交統可五千〇四十包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如下、</p>
<p>同行四、八〇〇香港二四〇統計五、〇四〇</p>
<h3>談話　紗市塲上所聞　且看日後怎樣</h3>
<p>邇來棉紗情况，盤盤見新局面，爲有新的生力軍加人陣綫，日見踴躍，因之市塲上，前前後後，人頭擠擠，實實足足，蠅羶蟻集，可想投　閧動之一斑。作者在市塲上所得甲乙兩人大談其紗市原理，値得一記，以爲讀者告</p>
<p>甲云：某某等勾結股票商證券幫金子幫絡續吸收二十支雙馬廠單的有四·五·千包之鉅，關閉不放，檯面上籌碼頓見乾涸，所以廠方雖天天賣出，市塲上只見拖進，越拖越多，市面乃只見大，不見其小</p>
<p>乙云：自「交易所」成立以還，紗價直綫上騰，四二支已漲四五百元，六十支在跳千元外，二十支紗平勻亦升三四百元，且雖有大戶做作目前底盤，已入高境，實銷如果呆滯勿起色，而大戶吸收之貨，一有反動，那時的狀况亦不知如何得了，廠方製造一包紗，潤益在二百元外，前天高峯見過後，多方稍爲吐出，六十支已回挫三百　，四二支跌百元，二十支疲下五六十元，目下大家站在蛇行錢上，一聲步伐不齊，深恐溜之乎也，有所不及。</p>
<p>兩位仁兄談得津津有味，作者從旁一聽，却也是事實，能不能免，可是一味拖進的朋友，他的最大的觀察，以爲中國棉產，幾可謂掃數被日人一統制」去了，又加以日美風雲鼓盪，美棉能吾接濟，大是問題，一般做紗花生意的以爲機會到了，好像買進了立刻有橫財可發，補償他近半年的損失，重溫他往時好夢，其實也未必如是罷，莫以爲「紗花」與「白米」同是「飯貨生意」，好向衆人頭上發一筆錢，要知將來能否實現，卽使實現，能吾由得你去賺錢，做好夢的人們，淸夜一思罷！（山）</p>
<h3>棉市仍堅　同業買賣熱鬧</h3>
<p>現棉交易不若上日之旺、惟人心仍堅、廠方需要又見冷滯、不過同業互相買賣、殊爲熱鬧也、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐的棉市、昨日市况又形活躍、先因同業之購買、後因華爾街股票價格之好轉、及股票帮之在市購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲三五磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、邇來竟日趨熱鬧之境、廠方需要殊爲健旺、同業心思、繼續看高、故廠方購棉亦殊困難、同業方面爲救濟滬上棉荒起見、已絡續訂購裝船貨矣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　紗綫回落　布市亦跌</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市回跌、趨勢尚穩、乃因原紗猛降、人氣虛怯、浮多脫售之故、細布斜紋跌每疋二角半至五角、粗布平平、色布色斜亦降價五角之譜、廠盤仍堅、惟成交驟形淸淡、多數採觀望態度、本街成交各貨三百餘件、閩幫辦色布色斜一百餘件、粵港幫辦粗布斜紋色布等二百餘件、北路烟台幫進重磅粗布等貨一百數十件、國外星加坡等地辦染色漂白布三千餘疋、今日有疋頭六百九十五件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　昨日以紗綫續挫、一般投機散戶、心虛傾賣、市盤步降、十二磅龍頭細布自三十七元九角開盤起、降至三十七元一角、惟同業心思仍好，進意不懈、故收盤時又轉堅昂、爲三十七元四角、四君子嗶嘰每碼價降至一元一角三分七厘半</p>
<p>、</p>
<h3>呢絨　只有女大衣　生意鼎盛</h3>
<p>昨呢絨交易鬧盛、各號零躉開出頗殷、女色呢絨、市銷加二繁盛、門莊幫其有紅藍綠紫黃靑等雜色呢絨、不論光毛、莫不門庭若市、一般仕女光顧、大有應接不暇之勢、其四馬路霞飛路一段時裝店、帶售旗袍料者、生意亦頗繁盛、試看棋盤街一帶呢絨門市舖、及南京路一帶綢緞洋貨呢絨部、其女色呢絨逐日剪銷、均有超過男色呢絨模樣、亦可見目今特殊環境中、女界購物用錢、較之男界暢快多多矣、</p>
<h3>證券　內債升沉甚微</h3>
<p>證券晤盤、昨市繼續盤旋、市價升沉於五分一角之間、多空雙方互相觀望、交易淸减、沉悶之局、一時殊不易打開、各帮存帳交易、亦逐漸减少、因多空均無確切把握、靜待時局展開、昨日交易上午淸减異常、午後稍有起色、多數均爲了結交易、上下買賣各方絕不相同、一貫買進、賣出者絕無其人、市塲淸淡人氣懈怠、始終五分一角間、浮沉不已、市價結果一致略小一角至二三角、成交總數共計的五十萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司股五百股、價爲二十三元八角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市開盤、人心良好、價格頗有上騰之象、但不久各種謠言又起、交易卽形减少、人心復現萎疲、當前形勢如此不定、市况一時碍難發展、</p>
<p>倫敦十五日（週三）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、祇滙豐銀行英倫註冊股略呈回風漲起一鎊半、價五十八鎊半、又香港註册股仍站七十鎊、有行無市、其餘不動、</p>
<p>匯通洋行經理之英商馬來橡樹有限公司擇於十月二十九日派本年度中期股息、每股一元、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯賣戶更見湧旺</h3>
<p>外滙日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、鬆象畢露、原以環境利空、人心鬆動、拋賣極力、晨開卽硬、迨近午刻、日美衝突之消息傳來、賣戶更趨積極、反之進者罕有、　價格最長現美滙達五元八七五、收盤市面、尚屬平靜、結果英鬆〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、期貨走勢與現貨相彷彿、</p>
<p>進戶甚為稀少</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均漲〇六二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬跌〇三一二五、美對英滬等皆平、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七八一二五、美滙五元七八一二五、較之上日收市、英美兩滙俱無榮辱、開後投機商猛塞於市、同時滙豐亦有售出、價頗鬆硬、計華行大陸上海及有利等吃進十一月份美滙五元八一二五、本月份告五元八四三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增百分之〇·二五、此後華行曾吐予外行本月份英金價三辦士八一二五、嗣至十一時半光景、再傳日美衝突等利空消息、投機商拋賣不絕、潛勢猛長、時本月份美滙外行入投機商鬆爲五元八七五、後日行來納略趨回頭、本月份美滙日行、滙外行五元八四三七五、收盤市面尚靜、計英金三辦士八一二五、美滙五元八四三七五、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金三辦士七九六八七五、美滙五元八一二五、比上日英金現貨長〇三一二五、下月份鬆〇六八七五、美滙期現各硬〇六二五、午後週三無市、</p>

<h3>籌碼枯短　金市所跌有限</h3>
<p>昨日現余烚赤晤盤、於外匯鬆硬中、結果仍挫、惟因近來銀根奇鬆、做多頭者均思收現、概娘現交、且在籌碼枯短、空戶無法施威、故雖跌有限、成交稀少上落則有增大、晨初爲狀尚昂、一度盤旋後、聞匯市猛長、最低遂慘落至五千六百三十元、收盤拉起十元、爲五千六百四十元、較上日軋小五元、半日交易的二千兩、銀樓飾金未更、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>晨初以人心尚定、開盤價反見抬高、計金號進證券帮十兩、五千六百七十元、後金號冉進銀號二十兩、爲五千六百八十元、時聞外滙鬆動、銀號及證券帮前來拋塞、挫跌數十元、計銀號出錢兌業二十兩、五千六百四十元、稍頃銀號忽思補空、錢兌業某戶亦搜購不少、價遂回漲、銀號出錢兌業二十兩、已高至五千七百十五元、但不久金號等猛吐復降、計金號出銀號十兩、五千六百五十元、又出證券帮二十兩、爲五千六百八十五元　而最低價爲銀樓帮入銀號僅五千六百三十元、午收錢兌業進銀號十兩、告五千六百四十元、結果較上日軋小五元、午後週三無市、半日八十五元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價　烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>美僑返國　需求美金票</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價漲後回平、故英美金鎊、一漲亦卽回平、美金票仍鮮有交易、市價依然站於原盤、美金票始因有少數美僑返國、對美金票需要甚殷、故市勢尚屬堅穩、嗣因黑市美匯步鬆、各方供給甚旺、晚市退至十六元五角八分、比上日軋跌二角二分、香港票隨港滬匯兌下落二分、日金票及朝鮮票仍甚堅挺、前者爲一元三角七分半、後者爲一元一角五分半、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米旺辦　新粳湧到</h3>
<p>洋米昨日早市開價卽疲、蓋承前日之疲風後、實銷更呆、而行囤以此决前後成交總數達二十五萬包外、尚有其他零星購辦與直接付裝者、併計至少有三十萬包、且其後批五萬包已定後天抵埠、其他亦經分批裝出、又愼記洋行等昨日尚有二號西（貢及米菉等一千三百噸之接洽、倘使定妥、更足以增厚供應、因此早市現洋米立小半元以上、旋有各囤趁平吸收、午市又復回振、回籠英華司則成交二百多噸、近遠期均開七十五元、午後進出兩淡、市居定勢、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種等、昨日來源依然湧旺、不下四千餘包、惟中新尖有限、大都屬於粳貨、故粳市續呈供求不勻、繼跌二元左右、若閔行新粳祇開原包七十八兀、斛見七十五兀、决至七十三元半、靑角窰種七十五元、百哥無市、洋杜尖貨稀站住、原包均開七十元、惟杜尖斛見爲六十六七元、泗涇野稻亦已上市、開七十九元，破礱已屬落令、無大進出、與前盤相仿、糯米目前朝一度轟足後、去路雖尚未衰、然價格已不易提升、呈無榮無辱之局面、</p>
<p>洋米來源接踵、華綸洋行ESSI號輪、由中通航運公司代理、自香港運來洋米一萬四千六百四十八包、昨日中午抵埠、停靠法租界天文台碼頭起卸、明日有大量洋米到滬、係法輪由西貢直接運來、</p>
<h3>破損鈔票</h3>
<p>— 沈鋆</p>
<p>鈔票雖用堅韌紙張印製，然轉輾授受，終易破毀，况當戰亂時期，有爲保存鈔票，大都埋藏地下，或秘密不易覺察之處，因之最易霉爛破碎，又如虫嚼火毀，以致殘破不全，多不知此種破損鈔票缺換辦法，於是錢兌商店，每條馬路，幾乎觸目皆有，持有破鈔者既不知。掉換辦法，因其便於兌換，祗得認痛受虧，然一究此種損失，爲數實亦可觀，譬如有家受戰亂災禍，已是家破物亡，今以僅有之財產，「破損鈔票」尚須遭受剝削，其痛苦爲何如乎？</p>
<p>現在財部雖定有破鈔兌換條列，復令內地各處郵局，懸牌免費掠換，體恤民艱，然民間尚未通曉，加以滬上爲各處人士避難之地，此種破損鈔票，大都集中上海，而各發行銀行，又都遠在法租界西區，其兌換地位，又日爲小錢莊烟兌店之出店學徒輩所捷足佔有，個人去兌換者，甚至等候終日，仍是不能兌到，不得已祇好受此種商店剝削，然長此以往，不思適當辦法，以便利大衆，並以取締此種兌換商店，未免有虧銀行服務社會之宗旨，以筆者管見，各發行銀行，在本埠重要地點，俱有支行辦事處分設，如將兌換破鈔處，亦附屬設立，不必專在總行一處，則有破鈔者，可就近掉換，免得遠道跋涉，其財部兌換條列亦須明白公佈，貼在明顯地位，使來兌者均知掉換辦法，此一則可免受錢兌店過分剝削，二則可免破鈔不能全額兌換時之口頭爭吵。蓋照銀行兌換破鈔規則，視鈔票破損程度，以定全額兌換，或半額兌換，或完全不値，從無七折八扣。（此皆係錢兌店明知兌換辦法而從中取利，凡遇可全額兌換之破鈔，七折八扣，討價還價，不知者屢受其愚，）譬之有人持拾元破鈔，向銀行去兌，其破壞程度，照列祇能兌給半數，然來兌者往往小知掉換辦法，七元八元，向銀行司兌換者致生爭執，如此旣費口舌，又費時問，如將兌換辦法明白公佈，可免此種爭執之煩擾，一方並請銀行當局，凡遇來兌者，實屬正當商人，或貧苦之輩，其破損鈔票並非故意毀壞，或破損程度，爲情有可原者，亦當破例全數或半數兌給。是蓋與銀行無損向來兌者則受惠至多矣。茲將財部頒佈之破鈔兌換條例，加以說明於后：（一）券已破裂，而所存尚在四分之三以上者，照全額兌給之。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>麫粉堅挺如故　小麥市呈僵局</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現交不暢、而市仍堅穩、查二號粉廠槃仍爲十六元五角、客盤十八元五角、均無整額批出、市上回籠貨籌碼早枯、喊價雖昂、概無正式交易、祇有少數洋粉聊以點綴耳、聞天津鑫生商業公司承辦之三角牌洋粉、由本街辦去一千包、價爲十八元四角半至四角、又高牌福壽洋粉價須十九元五六角、亦有少數成交、在目下洋粉輸華兵險問題困難之際、人心迄未鬆濫、惟實銷亦未見開展、故市面不脫堅靜之態、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况、頗呈僵局、因國內國外來源、均難暢通、滬市存底已薄、貨方頗思扳守、惟日廠以鳳凰粉禁銷租界、對於原料需胃平淡、限價仍祇二十一元左右、華廠方面進價爲二十五元、但亦屬無貨可收</p>
<h3>油市　油價再挫　囤戶野心勃勃</h3>
<p>昨日汕市再見下挫三四元不等、計成交膠州豆油五十件、價爲七十七兀、大有廠豆油三百担、價爲八十八元、八十六元、膠州生油三百件、價爲七十六元五角至七十六元、又路貨三百五十件、價爲七十七元、靑島生油五十桶、價爲一百零六元、十一月上半月內交七百桶、行情頗多波折、自一百零六元半、反復升降、曾跳見一百零七元七角半、入後步落至一百零六元、收盤又做開江北聽生油三百聽、價為一百零一元五角至一百元、照原由觀察、因來源銜接解抵期貨尚有充溢、刻下內地辦胃頗呈渴望、故有力份子有膽囤守、候一旦搬出證績發、以售善價、但暫時籌碼擁塞、趨勢不免受不景氣罩耳、</p>
<p>昨日靑島運來生油二千七百五十聽、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤屑存底充實</h3>
<p>白煤屑各貨、除前週到有一批、卽本市各棧亦甚充實、聞浦東某煤球廠藏有新鴻屑達七千餘噸之多，租界棧房亦不下此數、故存底豐足、人心穩定、昨開同業拆價、鴻基一號屑每噸一百廿四元、開炮屑一百十元、較上週無分軒輊云、</p>

<h3>燕雀與鴻鵠</h3>
<p>— 周肅父</p>
<p>燕雀含了泥草，忙碌地飛來飛去，在築巢，沒有停留，沒有休歇。忽然，它看見旁邊一個高枝兒上站着一隻鴻鵠，悠閒地像在深思。</p>
<p>燕雀飛過去，好奇地發問：「你站在這兒幹嗎？</p>
<p>鴻鵠回過頭來，瞧見了燕雀，似乎有點鄙視，看了一看，不作聲。</p>
<p>燕雀不懂事，亦忍不住，再問：『你幹嗎呢？』</p>
<p>鴻鵠長嘆一聲，抬起頭望着天，那末抑鬱地說：『你怎麽知道我的志向呢！』</p>
<p>燕雀似乎有點慚愧，紅着臉飛開了，仍舊趕緊去築巢。它已忘了剛才那回事，它祇顧着它的工作，它歡喜實際燕雀的巢築成了，它有了『家』，它因實際的工作，而取得了酬報。但，鴻鵠仍在高枝兒上發着長嘆，它有大志，但不屑幹小事，它等待着它的工作到來。</p>
<p>時光不停留的過去，燕雀忙着工作，鴻鵠發着嘆聲。是燕雀不知鴻鵠之志呢？還是鴻鵠不如那燕雀？</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>雨中行</h3>
<p>— 劉藝簣</p>
<p>……我再不能隱忍了，我要跳出這輛房子！這房子說它「一輛」是並不寃枉了它的，它就正如一個車廂——一個狹逼淺隘的車廂；悶暗，熱霉，擠窒！</p>
<p>外邊是一片陰黯，陰黯得像一個苦惱的面臉；然而雨點却似乎又稀少了。大槪苦惱的人也珍惜起他的熱淚來吧！我却決然一躍出門，飄然向雨中前行……</p>
<p>房屋像給雨打得更孤寂了，每座都顯得更高和更冷峭。街上，黃包車夫結實的腿在急步中濺起水花。一輛輛似座小型房子的車輛，有時連列起來，像一條動的屋巷那樣溜過。</p>
<p>路旁，一個斷腿的人，正吃力地匍伏爬行着。濕透了的衣裳好像再不怕什麽雨滴；又像並不知道雨點，正在無情地向他擊襲似的。是不是受苦的人，苦吃多了就不怕苦？抑是苦的磨折使他的感覺麻木了？我不知道。雖然我沒有撑一把傘在街道跑，我用乾暖的衣裳迎着雨。而我曉得：卽使雨把它淋透了，我的衣裳仍會因我的體溫與滿懷厭憤而暖和，炙熱起來的。</p>
<p>但我明白了，當我與那斷腿的人接近時，他蓬髮下的尖銳的眼光和低沉的喊喚，攫住我的心緒與步伐。他顫抖地抬起那塗有汚泥汚水的手續斷地說：</p>
<p>「……可憐——我斷腿的老兵！……衣服冷得他——耍命！……我曾經……打過仗！……」接着又是幾聲在痙攣狀的口喊出來的「先生！老闆！」的稱呼。我淸楚風雨把這茁壯的人顚簸創傷了：而現在，對於風雨，他已忘却了勝利的欣悅。他是被擊倒於另一種風暴中！</p>
<p>我攤開我身上僅有的幾毛錢，分給了他一點。之後，我低聲對他的背影又像對我自己說：「這並不是給與你斷腿的人作爲憐憫的愛護，這只算是我對在未斷腿前的，與風雨鬥爭的戰績者欽佩！……」</p>
<p>「可憐這一個老兵吧！」他底呼聲像依然戰抖着在迴旋，如聽到他內心的悲憤：爲了反抗暴力，爲了大家的生存，他戰鬥過了！犧牲過了！然而賴着他們的血跡以維獲得溫暖與安樂的人們，現在倒忘了安樂與溫暖之所由自了。他們大抵都反白了眼睛，揚起皮靴革履的響步聲，吐一口涎唾，跑遠這爲貧困所剝蝕而披上重重的汚垢與臭氣的，受苦的人。而他呢，他孤零地在這溫飽康樂之外徘徊。風雨中，雨把我的眼鏡打濛糊了，這在我回望這老兵時我才曉得。我趕忙除下了眼鏡，正看到一團在地上爬動的影子，拐進一個弄堂去。</p>
<p>我讓我的眼睛直接迎着雨點。雖則這樣我的視綫也不見得更爲光亮，然而炎熱的眼窩可已是凉浸浸，怪愉服的。</p>
<p>我昂然默行着……突然面前似乎有一座飛奔過來的東西迎面而來。近了，雷似的大聲叱喝下，我連忙閃過了這座房子似的黃似車。這車又飛奔向前了。</p>
<p>誰支配着他像個牛馬似的奔跑？誰鞭撻他令他要自願終日如飛地拚命趕前？我感覺到他剛才的大喊一聲並不是可恨的仗威的呼嚇，而却像牛馬受夏楚的喊聲般可憐了。</p>
<p>他還不如一個沒腿的老兵般自由呵！雖則他有腿，而且能冒着風雨，而且能大喊要別人躲避他……。</p>
<p>可是，我又自覺了；自己可不正就像剛才那個車夫般，要拉的車子，我的房子就是我自己租來的一輛；我這輛車裏的客人比他現在拉的還要多！……但我終於暫時能跳出來了，迎向沒腿的老兵行走着的風雨。</p>
<p>甚麼時候，我能做一個少年的兵勇呢？我在加大了的一日雨點中問自己。</p>
<p>雨更加大了，汽車濺起飛來到行人身上，帶走了車裏的笑聲。</p>
<p>在雨中，我記起似乎前人曾說過：「大雨後一定快有晴天，而這晴夭却更特別使人感到它的溫麗與明快」的話。</p>
<p>於是，我脚下的步武更增强了。</p>
<h3>昆蟲小識</h3>
<p>— 蒨</p>
<p>蚤大腿之長，的爲廿分之一吋，而能跳十三吋遠，七吋又四分之三高，若跳躍之遠近，只基於後腿之長短，則吾人大腿之長，以三呎計，須得跳七百呎遠，四百五十呎高。</p>
<p>螞蟻之每一複眼，乃由四十至五十個小眼所組成，家蠅之每一複眼中有四千餘小眼，鳳蝶之小眼有一七〇〇〇個，而天蛾及蜻蜓等之二複眼中，的有五萬個小眼，雖大部份昆蟲皆有完臻之視覺器官，然亦有少數種之昆蟲，其眼睛絕對缺如。</p>
<p>人類全身之肌肉的有四百至五百條，然昆蟲全身肌肉之條數，有較人類多十至十五倍者。</p>
<p>一對蠅，於四月初開始繁殖，若具子孫無有一死亡，則相互而繼續繁殖至本年八月，將有一九〇一〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇隻蠅生存於世，若每蠅之大小以八分之一立方吋而計，上述數量之蠅，將堆積於整個地球面上有四十七呎之高度。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>我彈去些烟灰，默默地吸了幾口烟，也不禁嘆了一聲。我承認我國的政治，有一部份的確還不曾走上正軌。因爲民洽的精神，在乎人人守法。身爲官吏，一舉一動，更不能隨意超軼法律的範圍。崔廳長平日雌沒有惡劣的政聲，但此番的舉動，顯然是違法的。霍桑此番去見廳長，當然也着重在道一點。他雖保證我不會跟廳長衝突，我却眞有些兒爲他担憂。</p>
<p>我又想到霍桑臨走時叫我跟李芝範談到他兒子守琦的事。這守琦霍桑早就把他排列在嫌疑圈裏，不過缺乏事實的根據，僅僅有一個理想。剛才據安娜說明了他和麗蘭還有婚的糾紛的關係，，他的嫌疑自然突然間加重了。老毛雖說他昨天一早就回到蘇州去，這事實還沒有證明。他儘可能假說回蘇州去，實際上却藏匿在什麼地方，到了昨天夜裏，冒着雨到麗蘭家裏去行兇。不過這件事實我要想向他的父親李芝範去查問，一定也沒有效果。第一，這老頭兒也許不知悄；第二，就是知情了，他也決不俞把兒子的罪行乾乾脆脆地吿訴我。</p>
<p>我丢了烟尾，又推想發案的經過。起先我們遇到的一個難題，就是槍聲發作以後，時間上兇手來不及再走進去盜取麗蘭身上的首飾。現在就可以假定，那個眞正的兇手，分明在打槍以前就用刀刺死麗蘭；刺死以後，拿了首飾出去；那時以後，趙伯雄才站在短牆外面開槍；這樣，時間上的矛盾，的確可以解除了。不過那個用刀行刺的兇手是誰？果眞是李守琦嗎？行刺時麗蘭怎麽沒有掙扎，也不發呼救的聲音？並且桌子上還有餘酒，好像伊很客氣地招待那兇手，這也是解釋不通的。還有老毛那雙脚上的皮鞋，的確很像那個甲印。如果是的，他又爲什麽秘密地進去？因爲據他的自供，並不曾承認這一點。那末，見財起意，行兇可會竟然是老毛？</p>
<p>我的手錶上已指三點鐘。我便放棄了這沒結果的推想，關照了一聲施桂，便出發向王家去。我坐在黃包車上，還躊躇着見了那李芝範怎樣措辭。因爲我要查訪李守琦的行動，也不能不小心一點，免得引起他的疑忌。不過我這心思也是白費的，我雖搆成了幾種談話的步驟，實際上竟毫無用處。　（一三八）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>平劇科班印象記</h3>
<p>— 大圭</p>
<p>平劇科班，人才輩出，成績卓著，自以北平當連述成爲首選。南方科班，民元以後，在滬地演出者，一爲繡雲天游藝塲（卽今大新街時報館原址）之「杭州小班」，後改搭大世界演唱，午弟輩以芳字命名，如章桂芳之老生，黃永芳之武生，李祥芳之武旦，皆爲班中人才，現搭大舞台林劇團之小生畢春芳，亦爲當時該班耍角。一爲城內小世界之「小東班」，子弟輩以福字命名，如周福善倪福長之老生，陳福勝之靑衣，爲該班中堅。該二科班惜規模較小，主持者辦理不善，允以後者爲甚，以致日久星散，飄零無存矣。創辦科班，本極不易之事業，非有持久之人力物力，殊難得到美滿之成續，富連成之有今日者，豈偶然哉</p>
<p>上海戲劇學校，創立未久，規模與組織，逈非前述二科班所可同日而語。日前公演於黃金，連演四日，皆吿滿座。子弟輩以正字命名。平日功課，除以平劇崑曲外，兼授常識·英文·算術·社會·國語諸科，可謂設備完全之科班矣。該校戲劇敎授類多伶界名宿。學術敎授，亦爲知名之士，故開辦後在最短時間，卽能與嗜劇觀衆相見於紅氍毺上。如王正堃劉正忠之武生，景正飛之文武丑，爲最有希望之人才。顧正秋之衫子，關正明周正榮之老生，如嗓子不發生變化，亦爲可造之才。且關生攻習譚派，周生宗於劉派，朝夕用功，不難出人頭地，但一藝人之成功，不能全恃修養與勤習，舞台經騐，實爲成功之極大因素。公演機會少，卽各生所得舞台經騐亦少。據聞該校有自建舞台之議，是各生能長期公演，當無問題。然而自建舞台，非可咄嗟立舉，爲各生藝術計，專演長本連台戲之各舞台，似無假座可能，黃金與更新，專聘平角，輪流出演，不妨與之訂的，在前批平角臨別期滿，後批平角未曾登台之中間，公演數日，一如此次在黃金所爲，一方調劑顧曲者口味，一方可以增進各生之舞台經騐，豈非兩全其美；且於另闢更新地盤，允使北區觀衆以使利，未知該校當局以爲如何？</p>
<p>該校此决公演，連日上座甚盛，每劇演，彩聲與掌聲不絕於耳，操絃者幾乎每段過門，皆加花點，彩聲尤覺熱鬧，是可見各敎授平日循循善誘，致有此成績。余意各生在此童年時代，入世朱深，對此外來鼓勵，一旦誤解，沾沾自喜，就學無止境之義言之，恐貽各生藝術以阻礙，是誠有待於各敎授督促與獎掖之如何運用矣。</p>
<h3>好萊塢影星起居注</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>西柴羅密洛，這個活躍的男子，最近患了一種時症，寒熱高至一百〇六度，使他不得小在醫院裏，靜靜地躺幾個星期。但請羅密洛迷」的朋友，用不着焦急，因爲據說現已痊愈。</p>
<p>好萊塢的羅曼斯總是層出不窮的，聽說加萊葛倫和白蓓蘭霍登現在很接近，倆人時常出入於公共塲所。吉士馬立斯跟麗爾巴喀也形影不離的在一起。至於瑙瑪希拉和喬奇賴甫德，詹姆斯史都華和奧立薇哈佛蘭兩對的熱度，更是有增無减。</p>
<p>我們已有好久沒有看見凱斯琳赫本的戲，但最近她又回來了（當然是指回到影城）並且立卽担任“The　Philadephia　Stouy”的主角，而那部影片的導演喬奇考克，也就是她第一次上銀幕時的合作人。</p>
<p>大眼明星瓊克勞馥，現已做了孩子的母親，不過那孩子並不是瓊親生，這個幸述的女孩子本楚孤兒，瓊因爲自己的年齡一年年的大起來，對於兒女非常渴望，所以就把她作了螟蛉女。</p>
<p>記得在沒有多久之前，潘麗茜拉蘭曾和奧理海倫秘密地結婚，但消息傳來，最近他們已宣吿仳雖，究竟爲了什麽緣故，却一個也不肯宣佈。</p>
<p>當琴蕙曼知道被派爲“Honeymoon　fou　Three”主角時，她抓抓頭皮說：唔，讓我想一想。一因爲她自從和羅蘭特利金結婚後，大家都忙於工作，沒有機會去度密月，現在正想趁此機會去玩一下，却又要派她做戲了。所以她說只有等明年正月生了孩子後，再度蜜月了。</p>
<h3>國華開攝「西廂記」</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>「西廂記」搬上銀幕，國聯主人於兩年前早有此議，且內定以陳雲裳胡蝶等合演，幷配以英語對白，期進出於國際市塲也。今日國華已開拍此片，張善琨表示同意，以免再打對台而致兩畋俱傷，國華之此片主角爲周璇（紅娘）白雲（張生）周起（惠明）蒙納（崔夫人）鳳凰（歡郞）陶由（琴童）至崔鶯鶯之一角，已決定派一新人担任。國華爲使周璇發揮歌喉計，片中揷曲特多，有「賴婚」「拷紅」「團圓」「長亭」等十闋之多，由范烟橋作詞，嚴華製譜，按國華主人柳中浩對歌唱片特感興趣，如三笑」「天涯歌女」莫不如此，彼對「西廂記」一片，仍有製爲中國璇宮豔史之意嚮云</p>

<h3>US Flying Fortresses to be Transferred to Britain Soon</h3>
<p>Washington - According to well-informed sources here, the United States will send its renowned B-17 Flying Fortress bombers to Britain. The date of President Roosevelt's signing of the necessary documents authorizing the manufacturers to transfer these bombers to Britain has not yet been determined. However, it is known that this action will be realized soon. An authoritative source told a Reuters reporter that it would not be surprising if thirty Flying Fortress bombers were to fly to Botwood, Newfoundland, within the week. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Reopening of the Burma Road, China and Britain Intensify Cooperation; Ambassador Guo Holds Extensive Talks with British Foreign Secretary; US Supplies China with Rice, Wheat, Medicine, etc.</h3>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night for a 45-minute meeting, followed by a lengthy discussion with Foreign Undersecretary Butler. The talks reportedly proceeded in an excellent atmosphere. Chinese sources stated that the possibility of Sino-British cooperation was one of the topics discussed, actually including aid. According to other sources, Ambassador Guo and Undersecretary Butler discussed issues arising from the British government's decision to reopen the Burma Road. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Red Cross announced yesterday that 500 tons of rice and wheat for Chinese refugees were shipped from Seattle to China this week on the "Colin Swallower" vessel. It also stated that medicine and cloth would be urgently shipped from New York on Saturday and Sunday aboard the "Washington" vessel, which is evacuating American citizens from the Far East, to Rangoon and then transported to Free China via the soon-to-be-opened Burma Road. According to the Red Cross's plan, it is very clear that these supplies will not be transported to Japanese-occupied areas in China. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Lashio, Burma - 100,000 tons of goods destined for China have already been stockpiled in warehouses here, with another 500,000 tons stored in Rangoon, all awaiting the opening of the Burma Road at midnight on Sunday. British customs officials stationed at the border will begin inspection procedures so that the goods can start heading to China by 2:00 PM on Thursday. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Lashio, Burma - Chinese and British officials have recently made final preparations for the reopening of the Burma Road. 10,000 tons of goods for China are waiting for inspection here. Officials from the Southwest Transportation Office of China and British officials from the Lashio Customs are working intensely, speeding up preparations and discussing technical issues related to the reopening of the road. Firearms, aircraft, and other goods that are currently prohibited will not be transported immediately upon the road's opening, but may be shipped a few days later. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - While Chinese authorities are placing great importance on the reopening of the Burma Road on Friday, there will likely not be a moving official ceremony or a large number of trucks passing through the road on that day. The rumor that 2,000-3,000 trucks will cross the border on Friday is largely wishful thinking, as the Chinese side seems to be in no hurry now that the road has been opened. In fact, Chinese authorities will carefully avoid concentrating a large number of trucks.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the US Returns Home by Plane to Discuss Far East Issues; US Ambassador Will Also Return to Washington for Consultations</h3>
<p>New York - British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, suddenly returned to Europe by plane yesterday, which was quite unexpected. People here are speculating that his sudden return to his country is due to the British government's urgent need to consult the United States on its attitude towards the reopening of the Burma Road. They hope that cooperation between Britain and the United States will be enhanced after the British ambassador returns to his country for consultations. Although diplomatic circles believe that the British ambassador will primarily discuss Far Eastern issues in London, Washington seems to perceive a slight easing of the situation in the Far East, as the authorities do not want the people to feel that Roosevelt's foreign policy is risky. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull stated that the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, will depart from London for Washington within a week or ten days. As far as he knows, Kennedy will return to his post after returning to his country for consultations. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Well-informed circles in Chongqing today, on the eve of the reopening of the Burma Road, anticipate that Britain and the United States will have a tough new policy to deal with the very tense situation in the Far East. Chongqing officials predict that Anglo-American policy will unanimously become more proactive and forceful in order to strengthen the positions of both countries. It is said here today that the Chongqing government does not plan to have any commemorative ceremony for the reopening of the Burma Road, but if Japan carries out its threat to bomb the road, appropriate and effective methods and preparations have been planned to ensure that transport vehicles continue to travel on the road.

<h3>US Warships Sail to Hawaii; French Newspaper Comments on US Position in the Far East; Major Actions Possible After the Election</h3>
<p>San Pedro, California - Twelve squadrons of the US fleet sailed from here to Hawaii yesterday to join the US fleet there. It is believed that these twelve squadrons of warships will conduct technical exercises en route to Honolulu. It is reported that other squadrons of the US fleet, originally scheduled to return to Hawaii yesterday, will enter dry docks here and in San Francisco for repairs, including the battleships "New Mexico," "Mississippi," and "Arizona," and two destroyers. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Lyon, France - "Le Temps" recently published an editorial commenting on the attitude of the United States in the current international situation, stating, "Since the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the reaction of the United States has been understood by the world, but its position does not seem to have changed significantly. At most, it has requested the Japanese government to explain its current foreign policy. Although the American press and public opinion have unanimously expressed strong opposition to the Tripartite Pact and believe that no matter what explanations are made by the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, this alliance directly threatens the United States, the US government has not taken any formal action that would make us believe that a military clash between the United States and Japan is unavoidable. In short, in the three weeks before the election, the position of the United States will remain the same, and no changes will occur. However, once the election results are announced, it may take major actions in the Pacific to change its current position." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Embargo on Steel Shipments to Japan Takes Effect Yesterday; Trade Relations Between US and Japan in a "Semi-War" State</h3>
<p>New York - The US ban on scrap iron and steel exports to Japan took effect last night. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Miyako Shimbun wrote exclusively this morning that Japan believes the American people do not want war, but Japan does not doubt that American public opinion advocates giving the greatest aid to China and Britain outside of war. The US ban on scrap iron and steel shipments to Japan will take effect today. It is possible that the United States holds the key to war and peace. However, war is a game that both sides can play, and the other side can proclaim it as much as it wants. Who can guarantee that the United States can safely play this game? The newspaper also listed 76 types of US export bans on the front page, stating that the Burma Road will reopen on Saturday, and the will of the United States is clearly visible. Japan will not take counter-measures. The paper also carried an editorial criticizing President Roosevelt for using war panic to win votes, saying that wearing iron armor and a priest's robe cannot deceive people for long, and now he will enter the arena fully armed. In addition to the newspaper's commentary, Tokyo is paying tribute to the war dead from today, so everything is in a state of holiday. Tomorrow is the Autumn Harvest Festival, a national holiday, and a semi-annual holiday for newsboys, so newspapers will also cease publication. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun said that cooperation between the United States and Britain is too deeply involved in Far Eastern affairs, and now it seems impossible to retreat. The US government's advice to American residents in the Far East to evacuate indicates that the US government will go to war with Japan if necessary, which remains to be seen. The US government seems to be in a dilemma with regard to Japan, namely (1) it must completely sever economic relations with Japan, or even resort to force if necessary, to maintain the status quo in East Asia. If so, aid to Britain will be greatly reduced and greatly reduced. (2) It cannot allow the Atlantic Ocean to be controlled by a third country, so it must help Britain maintain full control of the ocean. The Asahi Shimbun believes that if Britain wins the European war, the United States will not have difficulty solving these two problems, but if Britain fails, the United States will not be able to take an offensive against Japan. Some people believe that severing economic relations between Japan and the United States is sufficient to restrain Japan, while others believe that this move will encourage the Japanese government's southward advance policy and lead to war between the two countries. But in any case, trade relations between the two countries today can be considered to be in a "semi-war state." For this reason, trade relations between the two countries have made it almost impossible to ship Japanese goods to the United States and obtain foreign exchange. The British move to reopen the Burma Road has increased aid to the Chongqing government. The United Kingdom and the United States are also using various strategies to win over the Soviet Union, all of which are retaliatory plans for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan. If Britain is not confident in winning the European war, and if it does not obtain a promise of full military assistance from the United States, so that the two countries are on an equal footing to fight Japan, then it will not abandon its appeasement policy towards Japan. This is obvious. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs in the Philippines to be Commanded by the United States</h3>
<p>Washington - Plans for the US to command military affairs in the Philippines in the event of an incident in the Far East have been completed. Military authorities say the plan is a precautionary measure and there is no immediate need to implement it, but if deemed necessary, the President will announce it to take effect. It also cited Section 2 of the Philippine Independence Act, saying that while the US has the right to carry out extraordinary military strategies, the government does not intend to implement any plans without consulting the Philippine authorities. It is also reported that Resident Commissioner of the Philippines, Anrichaelte, and Speaker of the Philippine Assembly, Yuro, are preparing to discuss with the Department of the Army in hopes of obtaining a plan that will allow the US to provide military gifts and armaments to the Philippines.

<h3>The Japanese Political Situation Under the New Order Movement</h3>
<p>It has been exactly three months since Konoe reassumed power. During this period, he has expressed his political ambitions to a considerable extent, and has been engaged in major international adventures with a stubborn attitude. Of course, Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia with its southward expansion policy, and its conclusion of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, both have their roots in past history, and did not begin to brew only after Konoe resumed office this time. However, Konoe differs from his cautious predecessors in that he has implemented one by one the adventurous policies that they dared not recklessly adopt. In addition to the turbulent influence of the international situation, he undoubtedly has the support of the New Order Movement, also known as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which has been renamed recently. In his ideal, he roughly believes that through this movement, Japan can enter the category of totalitarianism; unified political leadership can control the economic, political, military, and even social levels and the entire nation; he is confident that Japan will not find it difficult to build a highly national defense state and compete with Germany and Italy, so as to engage in the redistribution of the world. Regarding the merits and demerits of the totalitarian system, we are not willing to criticize it now; but in the eyes of Japanese reformers, this is already recognized as the only way out; their adherence to Germany and Italy is almost no different from their admiration for Western Europe's freedom and democracy seventy years ago.</p>
<p>Looking back, the order in which Japan decided to change its political system and foreign policy does not quite coincide with the ideals of the reformists; in Germany and Italy, the totalitarian system was already quite consolidated and successful before it began to expand outward; but today's Japan is only preparing to solve its difficulties by changing its political system when its foreign adventures have reached a dead end. Moreover, the reform movement is just beginning to sprout, and its foreign adventurous actions are accelerating sharply, in contrast, one side is moving as slowly as a snail, while the other is chasing the wind and electricity; if the implementation of the latter is to be based on the achievements of the former, then premature harvesting and overstepping the mark, it is truly unknown how Konoe and others will reconcile the two, and how they will come together? However, Japan's empty and weak strength, fragmented and uncertain, is thus increasingly seen by the world through this gap.</p>
<p>Although Konoe's New Order Movement began long before he took power this time, its origin can be traced back to the Ogikubo Conference in the winter of 1936; but the form and specific application of this movement are still in the ignorant stage; what it has achieved is only the upper-level organizational array that has been realized after several transformations. Initially, what Konoe used to appeal was the New Party Movement, but after the establishment of the New Political System Preparation Committee, the meaning of forming a party gradually weakened; Konoe even solemnly stated that although it has a high degree of political nature, it is not a political party, and the reasons for this are difficult to understand. By the time the Imperial Rule Assistance Association replaced the New Political System Preparation Committee and was formally established, the so-called new political system did not seem to represent the reform of the political system itself, but only the nature of "assisting the monarch in handling state affairs" (see the outline passed by the Preparation Committee on September 13). At the same time, although the so-called Imperial Rule Assistance Association organization claims that all citizens of the country should participate, it only appoints cadres from top to bottom by the government, which has nothing to do with the people; although there is a National Cooperation Conference set up in its third and fourth layers to serve as an organ for lower-level sentiments to reach the top, the person in charge is the prominent right-wing giant, Suemitsu Masao, who is appointed as the chairman. With such a fragmented and peculiar organization, if it is said that it can shoulder the heavy responsibility of Japan's current difficult situation and make it comparable to Germany and Italy, that is truly an unimaginable future miracle.</p>
<p>Even with regard to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association itself, it has its own inherent weaknesses: First, the so-called unified leadership must of course be able to command the military; although Tojo has now agreed to participate in this movement as the representative of the three heads of the Army Ministry, active-duty soldiers will not join; the Navy's attitude is roughly the same; this clearly shows that the military is unwilling to submit and promote the unification of command and politics. Now that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has just been established, the Kokumin Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the military, is already attacking the "fierce competition for personnel in the process of its establishment, which has exhausted the ugliness of the world," and seriously criticizing Konoe's compromise with the old forces. It is not difficult to predict how the military will feel about this movement in the future. Second, the core meaning of establishing a highly national defense lies mainly in the economic aspect; according to the basic policy decided by the Preparation Committee on September 19, it is to properly gather agriculture, industry, and commerce together to create a new system in which production, distribution, and consumption are linked together, and to integrate all large, medium, and small industries into the same system based on cooperative associations; this goal is indeed surprisingly high, but it is unknown how its so-called creation and integration will be concretely carried out in order to overcome the major resistance in the economic world and the stubborn feudal nature of the Japanese industrial world? Regarding this point, there is still not a single word mentioned. Third, the so-called core personnel of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, even if the military attacks its excessive accommodation to the old forces and old-style political activists, the reformers are almost included without omission: the richness of its network is almost painstaking; but what it has achieved is only a mixture of physical phenomena, and lacks the fusion of chemical effects; as a result, only its complexity and contradictions are seen, and coordination is difficult, and it cannot achieve the effect of fusion and unification. In addition, if it is stipulated that the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association should be concurrently held by the prime minister, that will make Japan's political situation lose its flexible adjustment. If a political tide occurs again by chance, it is truly unimaginable how it will evolve to make amends.</p>
<p>The so-called reform movement originally had no deep foundation in Japan, and its momentum was less than two or three out of ten from spontaneity, and seven or eight out of ten from external instigation. Therefore, the recent situation of the New Order Movement, although not inactive on the surface; but looking coldly at the conservative camp, rather than disappearing, it is better to say that it is observing the situation in silence. In principle, whether the New Order can promote foreign adventures is already a big question. If its foreign actions suffer a major setback, or if the Axis powers suffer defeat, then it will definitely draw a new era in the evolution of the Japanese political situation.</p>

<h3>British Embassy Moves Back to Chongqing City</h3>

<p>Leiyang - Wang Yishu, a respected scholar of Hunan and a Hanlin scholar in the Qing Dynasty, has been living in seclusion in his village in recent years, often with an empty cupboard, but content in his situation. Last year, during the Battle of Changsha, he was twice forced to jump into a pond at Malin Bridge to avoid Japanese attacks. He was rescued but eventually died of illness due to worry and indignation on the 30th of last month.

<h3>President Roosevelt's Broadcast Explains the Profound Significance of Conscription; Defending Freedom is the Inherent Duty of Citizens; Preparing to Respond to the Threat of War</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech to the nation during "Draft Day," when 16,404,000 Americans began registering for military service, condemning absolutism and explaining the importance of conscription in responding to external threats. The President also used the American conscription practices of 300 years ago as an argument to explain the necessity of American conscription and the reasons for taking this step. The President said that those who dare to threaten the world with war and those who create and engage in the term "total war" have made us and all free nations feel "the necessity of national defense." Therefore, he advocated preparing to respond to the threat of foreign aggression. The President continued, "More than sixteen million American youth today have returned to the old American custom of conscription of three hundred years ago, and are engaged in fulfilling the first and inherent duty of free citizens. In the early colonial days, every able-bodied citizen was required to serve in the military to defend the country. Today is a day of profound significance and purpose in the lives of all of us Americans, for we Americans are today declaring the vitality of our nation's history, the unity of our will, and the unity of our nation. We are prepared to ensure that this new world, created by free people for free people to live in, remains peaceful forever. The United States, with 130 million people, currently has only 500,000 officers and soldiers in the ranks of the army and the national guard. I do not know that the armies of other countries with fewer people already have five or six million trained people. Our current program is to train another 800,000 people next year, and about one million people each year thereafter. This program is of a defensive and precautionary nature. We must remain calm and not be alarmed. We have now decided to build cannons, airplanes, tanks, warships, and all other kinds of modern national defense tools. We have also begun to mobilize our citizens to prove that after men are called up, women, property, and money will also unite to make national defense effective. Today's registration for military service is an important key to our national defense. When our ancestors laid the foundation of democracy, every American family had a gun and knew how to use it. Today, we live under the threat of foreign aggression, and we must again make the same preparations and precautions. We must again have the same spirit as those who are prepared to protect what they have created, protect what they have managed, and protect what they worship. Those who dare to threaten the world with war, those who create and engage in the term 'total war,' have made us and all free nations feel the necessity of 'total defense.' Today is not only a day to shoulder this responsibility, but also to create a program to act freely and consistently, to continue to build the American continent, and to truly gain freedom for the people who will be called into the army. I now declare to the sixteen million American youth who are registering today that democracy is the goal you are engaged in. Democracy is a form of society that can guarantee the rights of thought of every generation of people and make the world a better place." The President then condemned absolutism, saying that under absolutism, human beings are never allowed to use their thoughts to help improve the world. The President continued, "Today, if God blesses us, we will give the Americans of tomorrow a country that is maintained by freedom and justice. To realize this kind of country, we must devote ourselves to the purpose of peace. The mutual alliance of the American countries, the development of national spirit and national strength by us Americans today, is for peace." (16th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Content of US Conscription Law</h3>
<p>Washington - The main provisions of the US Conscription Law will be implemented in the middle of next week. The contents of these provisions are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Registrants - All people who have passed their twenty-first birthday and have not reached their thirty-first birthday must register. This registration applies equally to both nationals and foreigners. However, foreigners who have not declared their willingness to become American citizens may be exempt from conscription. Nationals with families must also register. Registration is handled by selected officials. Active duty personnel, reservists, and trainees in the Army, National Guard, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, personnel engaged in surveying and public health affairs, and officials (excluding employees) of the federal government and state governments are all exempt from registration.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Conscription - This bill provides for the conscription of 900,000 people to engage in training at any time. 400,000 people may be conscripted this fall. The order of conscription is determined by lottery. The lottery is held by conscription bureaus throughout the country. This bill gives the president broad authority to formulate conscription rules. Conscription bureaus rely on these rules to determine their candidates. According to the Department of the Army, the department does not want anyone with family members or engaged in major agricultural and industrial industries to be drafted into the army. College students may be exempted from conscription, and physical fitness should also be considered. Anyone who disagrees with the selection of the local conscription bureau may file a complaint with the appeals bureau established under this bill.</p>
<p>(3) Penalties - Anyone who evades conscription or helps others evade conscription will be sentenced to five years in prison or a fine of $10,000, or both. These crimes will be tried by federal courts.</p>
<p>(4) Term of Service - The term is set at one year, but it may be extended indefinitely when national interests are endangered. All people who have completed one year of active service are reservists. Most of the conscripted people must join the army, and then a small number will join the navy.</p>
<p>(5) Those Who Request Exemption from Military Service Based on Moral Reasons - If these people can prove to the Department of Justice that their unwillingness to serve is based on legitimate religious reasons, they may be exempt from military service. However, the president may still order such people to engage in non-combatant services.</p>
<p>(6) Salary - During the first four months of one year of training, conscripts can receive a salary of US$21 per month. For the following eight months, the salary is US$30 per month, unless they are promoted and receive a higher salary.</p>
<p>(7) Where Conscripts are Stationed - It is stipulated that it is limited to the Western Hemisphere, the United States mainland and US territories, including the Philippines. This provision does not include sending conscripts to Europe.</p>
<p>(8) Job Security - Guarantee that conscripted personnel will still be able to return to work in the future without losing their original jobs.</p>
<p>(9) Debt Security - This bill stipulates that debts such as taxes and insurance premiums owed by conscripts may be postponed until after the training period.</p>
<p>(10) Expenses - According to the Department of the Army's estimate, $100 million is needed each year. Although this bill stipulates that the Department of the Army may use funds, Congress still controls the implementation of the program. The payment of necessary funds must be approved or rejected by Congress.</p>
<p>(11) Volunteering - All people aged 18 to 35 have the opportunity to volunteer and engage in one year of service.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union and Japan Sign Agreement Not to Obstruct Aid to China; Japanese Newspaper Claims Soviet Union Will Convene Four-Nation Conference of Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Japan</h3>
<p>London - Diplomatic circles here believed last night that it is highly possible that the Soviet Union and Japan will soon sign a non-aggression pact. It is widely believed that Germany has been putting pressure on Moscow to resolve disputes with Tokyo and sign a non-aggression pact with Tokyo similar to the German-Soviet alliance. The new Japanese ambassador to Moscow, Tatekawa, is currently en route to Moscow. It is believed that he will begin negotiations quickly after arriving in Moscow. It is pointed out here that the signing of the Japanese-Soviet non-aggression pact will allow Japan to shift its full attention to its southward program without worrying about its rear. Diplomatic circles here believe that if Japan and the Soviet Union conclude this agreement, it will only be a kind of truce and will not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to assist the Chongqing National Government in resisting Japan. Well-informed sources here expressed deep skepticism about the alleged Soviet attempt to form a strong Balkan group, including Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia, to resist the Axis powers' offensive in the Balkans. However, it is widely believed that the Soviet Union has made it clear to Turkey that if Turkey decides to resist Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union will not interfere. (16th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Hochi Shimbun stated today that certain authoritative sources in Tokyo have received reports that Stalin, after consulting with Molotov and other leaders, has decided to convene a four-nation conference of the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Japan in the Kremlin in order to determine a foreign policy suitable for the new international situation. The newspaper continued that the conference will likely open in early November, after the new Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, arrives in Moscow. Stalin may attend in person to express the Soviet Union's intentions. It is claimed that this move by the Soviet Union is a rare example in its diplomacy, and Stalin's decision has "thrown Britain into a panic." (16th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers continued to attack the US government and its senior officials today. The Miyako Shimbun especially attacked President Roosevelt's recent speech, saying that the president is only dragging the United States and Japan closer to war. The newspaper said, "The recent remarks and posture of the United States have become increasingly reckless. The steps currently taken by the United States are only bringing it closer to war. The United States should also pay attention to its own actions at this time." The newspaper also said that Japan has taken effective measures to deal with the US embargo on scrap iron. The Soviet Union now has a good opportunity to try to get closer to Japan. The newspaper concluded that most of the Japanese people now advocate improving relations with the Soviet Union.

<h3>Rumor That Governors-General of Taiwan and Korea Will Be Replaced</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun stated today that Prime Minister Konoe's promotion of the New Structure Movement will soon cause Admiral Kobayashi, Governor-General of Taiwan, and General Minami, Governor-General of Korea, to be relieved of their duties. It is claimed that this dismissal order is to strengthen Japan's overseas administration. The two governors-general have been in office since 1936 and have long hoped to retire. Kobayashi has even requested the government to appoint a successor. The newspaper also claimed that Taiwan and Korea are vital to military importance. The former will be appointed by a naval admiral as the successor of the governor-general, and the latter will be appointed by a military general as the governor-general.

<h3>Future Attitude of the Soviet Union Is Related to the Safety of Turkey; Germany Extends its Influence to the Black Sea; The Soviet Union Takes Military Precautions</h3>
<p>London - The "Daily Telegraph" editorial stated that Soviet diplomacy in the past twelve months has clearly sought to avoid conflict with Germany, preferring to endure German pressure rather than argue with it. However, Germany's extension of its influence to the Dardanelles Strait directly affects the interests and security of the Soviet Union, which is something the Soviet Union must repeatedly consider. The German-Italian-Japanese alliance is not only aimed at the United States, but also at the Soviet Union, which the Soviet Union has deeply considered. It is believed that the Soviet Union may soon be forced by events to show its hand. Turkey is naturally paying close attention to the Soviet Union's attitude. (October 16, Reuters)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Turkish officials, alarmed by Germany's push into Romania and the Black Sea, are now speculating on who is the next target on the Nazi agenda. Well-informed sources believe that Bulgaria and Greece will be successively swallowed up, and Yugoslavia will therefore become a second Sweden, allowing the Axis powers to arbitrarily dispose of Turkey. It is generally believed that Germany can enter Bulgaria when its preparations are complete, but the situation in Greece is uncertain. If Greece resists, it is believed that Turkey will join in the aid. A reliable Turkish official said, "Our time will undoubtedly come, but probably not in the near future. Another factor that can reassure Turkey's fears is that the Soviet Union will not allow the Axis powers to seize the Dardanelles Strait." (October 16, United Press)</p>
<p>Budapest - The news of a large concentration of Soviet troops on the Romanian border has stirred up the people of the Balkans. Although the Soviet embassy in Romania has repeatedly assured that the Soviet military's actions are only exercises, Southeastern Europe is very tense today. "News from Bucharest says that Soviet troops have stormed into Romania near the mouth of the Danube and have advanced to Serina." According to news arriving here, the Soviet Ambassador to Romania admitted that there are twenty divisions of Soviet troops concentrated on the Romanian border, but declared that this military action is only a routine exercise. It is reported that the concentrated troops include fully armed infantry, as well as motorized and air force units. At the same time, along the coast of Bessarabia, the Soviet Danube Fleet has added four more low-profile ironclad ships. A heavy artillery unit has been established in Reni, twenty miles from Galati.

<p>The Red Army Strictly Enforces Discipline and Prepares for Contingencies</p>
<p>Moscow - The new military order of the Red Army, published here yesterday, has given absolute power to Soviet military officers to ensure absolute obedience to orders from soldiers, even if it means using force. The military newspaper "Red Star" recently commented on this matter, saying, "The Soviet Union should not forget for a minute that it is currently surrounded by capitalists. The tense international situation has forced us to be ready at any time in a state of general mobilization to deal with contingencies. The Red Army should adopt even stricter discipline than a class-based army. When our officers issue an order, we must immediately carry it out. We should never discuss whether the order itself is appropriate. False notions of freedom should not be tolerated. We must find a way to eliminate them from their roots. Therefore, if a violation of orders occurs, the military officer can resolve it with force without being held responsible. Military officers who cannot resolutely implement the necessary plans will be subject to military law. Those who perform poorly will be severely punished." (October 16, United Press)</p>
<p>German Troops Enter Romania; The Soviet Union Has Not Been Notified</p>
<p>Moscow - TASS recently issued the following communiqué: "The Danish newspaper 'Politiken' recently published a report from its Berlin correspondent stating that 'regarding the dispatch of German troops to Romania, the German side has promptly notified the Soviet government. At the same time, the Kremlin has also been notified of the number and purpose of the German troops sent to Romania.'" TASS has recently been officially authorized to declare that the above report is completely inconsistent with the facts. (October 16, TASS)</p>

<p>Clermont-Ferrand, France - "Qingyi Bao" recently published an article discussing the arrival of a German military delegation in the capital of Romania, stating that the main purpose of this move by Germany is to fill the ranks of the Romanian army with German officers or to train the Romanian army according to German military standards, so that the country's army will become a powerful tool in the future and maintain close contact with the German army. From this perspective, a military power is about to appear in the Balkan Peninsula near western Asia. This move in itself is already of great significance, and neighboring countries such as Turkey are particularly concerned. (October 15, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Night Raids; London Suffers Another Brutal Bombing; More Than 200 Tons of Various Bombs Dropped; Heavy Casualties in a School Due to High-Explosive Bombs</h3>
<p>London - London and various provinces of England suffered brutal air raids last night. The number of bombs dropped by German aircraft this time was even greater than before. However, from a military perspective, last night's air raid cannot be said to be extremely brutal. The German side claimed that there were thousands of German aircraft attacking London and that thousands of tons of bombs were dropped. However, according to official sources here, the total number of German aircraft found over the entire England was only about 150, and the number of bombs dropped in London was only about 200 tons. However, the seriousness of the successive air raids should not be underestimated, as the damage caused by the indiscriminate bombing of German aircraft is indeed a very brutal act. Officials also stated that the German aircraft's air raids were so-called "terror bombings," and their main purpose was to attack civilians, as the losses in military equipment were relatively minor. Last night, due to the large number of bombs dropped by German aircraft, civilian property inevitably suffered huge losses, but civilian casualties were lighter than in previous air raids, as people knew to take shelter in basements in time. The large contingent of Nazi aircraft soaring over the English capital last night was far greater than before, and all types of bombs were dropped, such as incendiary bombs, oil bombs, Molotov bread baskets, giant incendiary bombs, time-delayed bombs, and high-explosive bombs. The English anti-aircraft artillery units also concentrated their efforts to fight with the German aircraft. At least 23 German aircraft were shot down. A school was hit by a high-explosive bomb, resulting in heavy casualties. A high-explosive bomb also landed near a public air-raid shelter, injuring one Japanese. Another high-explosive bomb destroyed a portion of a building in an apartment, and the bomb also blew a crater in the street and broke a gas pipe, causing a gas leak and fire. When the bomb exploded horribly, all the glass windows of a church were shattered, and the buildings of a large hotel in London also shook. The windows on both sides of the hotel were also blown away. Last night, the air raids by German aircraft in various provinces of England were also more widespread than before. Various cities in Scotland were severely bombed, and a town in the Midlands was the worst hit. A giant bomb struck a church, and it is feared that there are still several people buried in the rubble of the destroyed church. In addition, two schools and many houses in the town were damaged, but it is believed that the casualties are not very heavy. (October 16, United Press)</p>
<p>Berlin, German Capital - Air Raid Alert</p>
<p>Berlin - Officials announced that there was an air raid alert in Berlin last night at midnight, but no aircraft appeared. According to authorities, British aircraft had invaded the western part of Berlin, 3,500 miles west of Brighton Fort, but failed to reach the German capital. The alert issued in Berlin was only for precautionary purposes. (October 16, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - Today, the Air Ministry announced that on Tuesday night, British aircraft bombed a naval dockyard in northern Germany, transportation lines and oil depots in the west and center, and various ports in the German-occupied Channel. (October 16, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Details of British and Italian Naval Battle in the Central Mediterranean; Two Italian Ships Sunk, One Heavily Damaged; British Ship Ajax Distinguished Itself</h3>
<p>London - The British light cruiser "Ajax" (7,000 tons, armed with eight 6-inch guns) sank two Italian destroyers and heavily damaged one last Saturday off the coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean, and severely attacked other Italian ships, including a heavy cruiser, causing them to flee. It is learned that the "Ajax" had previously joined a light cruiser and the heavy cruiser "Exeter" in the Battle of the River Plate against the German warship "Spee" in December of last year, driving the German ship into the port of Montevideo, which eventually scuttled itself. The Admiralty announced that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported that the "Ajax" had engaged Italian ships, stating that on October 11, the "Ajax" was active in the eastern and central Mediterranean, about eighty miles southeast of Sicily. It encountered three Italian Elroni-class destroyers of 679 tons. The "Ajax" immediately engaged them and quickly sank one of them. Before long, the "Ajax" encountered an Italian heavy cruiser and four destroyers, and once again engaged in battle, damaging one enemy destroyer. The remaining enemy ships fled in the darkness. The British ship "Deuk" rushed to assist, believing that the "Ajax" had been in contact with a large enemy fleet, but did not make contact with the enemy ships that night. At dawn, with the help of aircraft from the Naval Air Force, the damaged enemy ship was detected being towed by another enemy destroyer that had come to its aid. When the "Ajax" arrived, the enemy destroyer that had come to its aid quickly abandoned the damaged enemy ship and sped away to Sicily under the cover of smoke. At this point, it was confirmed that the damaged enemy ship was the "Adraglia" (1,600 tons), the latest class of large destroyers in the Italian fleet. The crew of the ship began to abandon ship when they saw the British ship "Deuk" arriving quickly. The British ship allowed them to abandon ship within half an hour, and then fired to sink the ship. The "Deuk" lowered rafts to help the Italian crew escape and broadcast a wireless message on the Italian radio's commercial frequency, explaining the location of the rescued Italian crew members. Although the British ship revealed its own location at the same time by doing so, it still sent this message. It is learned that when the Italian cruiser "Collioni" (the former flagship of the Italian Navy in the Far East) was sunk on July 19, the British destroyers were bombed by Italian aircraft when they went to rescue its crew, causing the British ships to be unable to continue taking measures to protect the safety of the rescued Italian crew members. This time, although the British ships knew that there were Italian aircraft gathering nearby, they still telegraphed the Italian side the location of the rescued Italian crew members. The "Ajax" suffered several casualties in this battle, and the ship's hull only suffered minor damage above the waterline, which did not affect its combat effectiveness at all. The Italian General Headquarters also acknowledged the loss of two small ships and one large destroyer, but claimed that one British cruiser, or possibly a Poseidon-class cruiser, was also sunk. Afterwards, the British ship was attacked by Italian aircraft for four hours. Although the Italian communiqué stated that one aircraft carrier and one heavy cruiser were hit, in fact, the British ship suffered no damage or casualties, while four enemy aircraft were shot down by British Naval Air Force fighters and anti-aircraft artillery fire. It is possible that other enemy aircraft were also destroyed, and all the British aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>On the night of October 13, British Naval Air Force aircraft raided the port of Lago in the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands. Bombs hit barracks, factories, hangars, and gasoline piles, causing fires to burn. All the British aircraft returned safely. British submarines have also been successful in the Mediterranean, bombarding military targets in the port of Savona, sinking an armed merchant ship of 5,000 tons escorted by torpedo boats off Genoa, and sinking an armed merchant ship of 3,000 tons off Vado. Another British submarine sank an enemy supply ship of about 3,000 tons off Naples, and a third British submarine sank an enemy supply ship of 800 tons off Benghazi.

<h3>The All-India Congress Party Passively Resists; Gandhi Clarifies Plans</h3>
<p>Wardha - The leader of the All-India National Congress, Gandhi, published an article here last night, outlining his plan for individual non-violent resistance, including the statement, "Who knows if I will not be an instrument for promoting peace, not only between Britain and India, but also between all the warring countries in the world." Gandhi explained his reasons for not entering prison, saying that this will be the last non-violent resistance movement he leads, so he has to stay out of prison in order to deal with any contingencies that may arise. The All-India National Congress cannot show malice to Britain, nor can it assist Britain with arms, because of its non-violent beliefs. Gandhi further stated, "I know that India is not of one mind and one heart. Part of India has not forgotten the war and will help Britain fight and learn tactics, so the Congress Party does not want to surround armories or military camps to prevent people from doing what they want to do."

<h3>The United States Negotiates with South American Countries Seeking a Diplomatic Alliance to Prevent Totalitarian Aggression</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt declared last night that although the United States often exchanges views with other Latin American countries on the issue of Western Hemisphere defense, he has no knowledge of the plan regarding special bases, stating that the United States has held discussions with the above-mentioned countries. The President did not elaborate on the details of the views exchanged between the United States and South American countries. However, according to well-informed sources here, although the US's plan to negotiate with Brazil and Chile to lease bases has not yet matured, important military negotiations are indeed underway, and their purpose is to seek a diplomatic alliance to prevent totalitarian aggression.

<h3>British Overseas Chinese in Romania Are As If in Hell; The First Batch of Evacuated Overseas Chinese Return Home via Istanbul</h3>
<p>Istanbul - The first batch of one hundred British Overseas Chinese and two hundred refugees from other countries who had sought refuge from Romania arrived here today. They arrived on the Romanian ship "Bessarabia," which was delayed by eight hours from the scheduled time, reportedly due to a thorough search by members of the Iron Guard in Constanta.

<h3>Withdrawal of Naval Dependents from Shanghai. US Flagship to Sail to the Philippines Tomorrow. Rumor Suggests Direct Voyage to US, Temporarily Abandoning the East. Two Transport Ships Arrive, to Carry Another Batch.</h3>
<p>The flagship Augusta of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet will depart on the morning of the 18th, carrying naval reservists ordered to enlist in Shanghai and families of senior naval officers to Manila. This marks the first group of American expatriates evacuating from Shanghai. According to reliable sources, after arriving in Manila, the flagship will not return to Shanghai, but will continue sailing to the United States. Whether Rear Admiral Hord, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, will accompany the flagship is uncertain. The flagship Augusta typically cruises the China Sea, visiting Tianjin, other ports in North China, and Manila, but rarely returns from the Far East to the Western Hemisphere. Families, women, and children of other lower-ranking naval officers, as well as naval documents and archives, will leave Shanghai on the transport ships Gold Star and Chaumont. These two ships will arrive here from Manila tomorrow morning at 11:30 AM (yesterday's report that Gold Star came from North China was incorrect).</p>
<p>American Community Holds Meeting to Prepare</p>
<p>A committee formed by the American Community Federation and the American Chamber of Commerce in this city held a meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday at noon to conduct preliminary research on plans for evacuating American expatriates from the city. Details of the meeting were not disclosed, but it is understood that discussions were held on topics such as travel expenses and transportation arrangements for Americans returning to the United States. It is also known that officials and members of the American Chamber of Commerce are making every effort to secure discounted ship tickets for Americans willing to leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Two More Liners Arriving, also of Significant Tonnage</p>
<p>The US government plans to deploy two giant liners, Manhattan and Washington, to various locations in the Far East to evacuate expatriates. It is reported that the two liners will complete their inspections within the week and then set sail eastward. It is now known that after these two giant liners, the US government has requisitioned two more large mail ships from the Matson Navigation Company, the S.S. Mariposa and S.S. Monterey, to transport expatriates from the Far East. These two mail ships originally operated on the San Francisco-Australia route, via Honolulu, Pago Pago, Suva, Auckland, to Sydney, Australia. They have a displacement of 19,000 tons, a length of 632 feet, a width of 79 feet, and a speed of over 22 knots per hour. Both liners are identical, slightly smaller than the Japanese Empress liners. Internal facilities include grand dining rooms, lounges, gyms, swimming pools, elevators, sun decks, and tennis courts, all lavish and splendid. Passenger capacity for first, second, and third class totals over 700 people, making them leading mail ships on the US-Australia route. The company's Far East agency was previously handled by Chang Hing Company. The import and export procedures for the future expatriate evacuation will be handled by the American President Lines, but the company has not yet received instructions from its head office, so there was no announcement yesterday.</p>
<p>US Liners Scheduled to Stop at Four Ports</p>
<p>According to the highest authorities of the American President Lines in this city yesterday, after the State Department issued a notice advising American expatriates in the Far East to evacuate, the company has received over 3,000 applications for cabin bookings from Americans in Shanghai who wish to leave quickly. Current general opinion suggests that the number of Americans in Shanghai who will leave for their home country may exceed this number. The formal notification of the Matson Navigation Company's mail ships being dispatched to Shanghai to evacuate American expatriates was received yesterday by the US Consulate General in this city, but according to Acting US Consul General Butrick, there is no further news regarding the evacuation. The ports of call for the mail ships used for evacuating expatriates are Yokohama, Kobe, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Other ports will be added as necessary.</p>
<p>British Expatriates in This City Not Evacuating for Now</p>
<p>Since the American expatriate community in this city has actively begun to evacuate, and because of the recent cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Pacific, there has been much speculation as to whether British expatriates will also evacuate. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited the British Relations Bureau yesterday. According to the bureau, the British authorities have not yet issued any orders for the evacuation of British expatriates, so an evacuation will not be implemented. Furthermore, according to reporter inquiries, the general mood among British expatriates in this city has been somewhat tense since the American expatriates began to evacuate, but the general situation remains calm. Although a small number of British expatriates have volunteered to serve in the military to defend their country, the majority of British expatriates are engaged in commerce as before. Although the situation in the Far East has clearly worsened, few British expatriates have left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Avoids Mentioning the Truth of the Situation</p>
<p>According to people from Tianjin, since the fall of North China, the Japanese have controlled trade in minute detail. Therefore, American and British merchants feel the pain of competition from Japanese goods when trying to sell their own, and because of Japanese control, it is difficult to purchase Chinese local products to bring back home. Therefore, after the US State Department's expatriate evacuation notice arrived in Tianjin and Beijing, American expatriate women and children, as well as merchants from various industries with sluggish business, began preparing and eagerly booked ship passages to Shanghai. Chinese-language newspapers in Tianjin run by the Japanese said that the American military and civilians would soon follow the British precedent of withdrawing troops stationed in China, as a sign of recognizing the "New Order in East Asia." Such self-deception is evident, and it can be imagined how much they are avoiding mentioning the tension between the US and Japan.</p>
<h3>Internal Transfer of Idle Capital Can Yield Substantial Profits: 850 Yuan in Legal Tender Can Buy 1,000 Yuan in Chongqing</h3>
<p>It is understood that up to the first half of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the amount of idle capital transferred from Shanghai banks to the interior has exceeded 250 million yuan, not including the amount transferred by commercial firms and individuals. Banknotes issued in North China and Hankou, which used to circulate in Shanghai, have now flowed into the interior since the three banks were allowed to remit them to the interior at full value. Furthermore, bank deposits have been increasing daily. From the spring of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) to the present, total bank deposits are estimated at 300 million yuan, accounting for over 40% of the total bank deposits in the country. Of these deposits, 70% are demand deposits. The National Government has now decided to offer preferential treatment for the internal transfer of this idle capital as an incentive. According to yesterday's market rates, paying 850 yuan in legal tender in Shanghai would yield 1,000 yuan in legal tender in Chongqing. However, the fees and discounts for internal remittances vary among banks and money shops. It is reported that some commercial firms charge even higher fees, but their creditworthiness is unknown.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses with Japanese Side to Resolve Rice Shortage in the City. Foreign Exchange Rates and Shipping Costs Uncertain. Citizen Food Supply Cannot Excessively Rely on Foreign Rice.</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that several officials from the Shanghai Municipal Council held informal discussions with the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) in an effort to seek cooperation and resolve the rice shortage in the city. It is reported that Municipal Council officials requested that the Japanese military authorities allow the passage of domestic rice to meet the urgent needs here. The Japanese military authorities stated that they would</p>
<p>Investigate the Matter</p>
<p>in order to decide what action they could take. According to an official from the Municipal Council's Price Investigation Department yesterday afternoon, the amount of domestic rice arriving in Shanghai is far lower than the required amount. The only way to solve the rice problem is to immediately transport large quantities of cheap domestic rice. Since the rice-producing areas are currently under Japanese control, it is hoped that the discussions that began two days ago will yield concrete results, at least allowing some rice to come to Shanghai to meet the needs. He has held several informal talks with a Japanese liaison officer, and this morning he again</p>
<p>Discussed the Rice Situation</p>
<p>with the Japanese liaison officer. The officer stated that the senior Japanese military authorities would consider the matter. Due to uncertain exchange rates, high foreign currency prices, and expensive transportation costs, rice prices are bound to be affected. Therefore, Chinese residents cannot rely too much on foreign rice. The same official mentioned that the exchange rate for legal tender has recently improved, for example, the US dollar fell by one-fifth last month. However, according to reports received, prices have not decreased because there is no price control in the International Settlement. Furthermore,</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Profits</p>
<p>are considerable after the Price Evaluation Committee decided on the profits, which has won the approval of residents, both Chinese and foreign, throughout the city. Yesterday, a citizen suggested that the committee's measures were reasonable, but increasing the extra profit by 5% seems too high. Foreign rice shipped to Shanghai is not sold immediately upon arrival, but is stored in rice warehouses, waiting for prices to rise, sometimes for more than half a year. If these stored rice are also given a 5% profit, based on past purchase prices, the profits would be considerable. At the same time, foreign rice that has recently arrived will also yield considerable profits if given a 5% profit. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities in both settlements will consider the livelihoods of ordinary people and reduce this extra profit.</p>
<h3>Economic Committee Recommends Recruitment to Replenish Authorized Police Force. With Abnormal Situation, Crimes Occurring Repeatedly, Police Budget Must Be Increased.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Economic Committee's interim report states that the current situation in the city is abnormal, especially in the Western District. The issue of establishing a special police force in the defense zone is still being negotiated between the Council and the relevant parties. In addition, an agreement has been reached for the area north of the Suzhou Creek to establish a new police district, "District E." All of these are matters to which the Committee has paid special attention. The Committee is</p>
<p>Striving to Reduce Expenses</p>
<p>and is doing its best to make contributions. However, in fact, reducing expenses on the police force should be contingent on the restoration of local order. The current organization of various departments of the Police Department is based on the recommendations of former Commissioner E.I.M. Barrett in 1929, which is the so-called "authorized police force." Since then, due to financial reasons, the police force has been reduced year by year to the so-called "budgeted police force." The Committee, in view of the current unstable situation in the settlement and the continuous occurrence of crimes, is making the following</p>
<p>Recommendations to the Council</p>
<p>(1) The foreign divisions one and two and the Indian division should be replenished as soon as possible to reach the number of the "budgeted police force." (2) The number of foreign divisions one and two should be increased by thirty-two and fifteen people respectively, compared to the "budgeted police force," according to the above-mentioned "authorized police force." These vacancies should be filled immediately by recruiting or promoting Chinese officers, with positions at the level of deputy inspector or higher. (3) The Indian division should be increased by sixty-seven people according to the "authorized police force." Low-ranking Chinese officers should also be promoted to fill these vacancies, and efforts should be made to recruit the remaining number.</p>
<p>Maintaining Order</p>
<p>is the main task of the Police Department. However, the cost of maintaining order cannot be low. Therefore, if the Committee's previous recommendations are implemented, the budget must be increased. At the same time, it is believed that all taxpayers, for their own interests, will be happy to shoulder this additional burden. Regarding the merger of the Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps into the Police Department, the reasons have been detailed in the previous report. The Police Department has now prepared a plan to reorganize the Police Department and submitted it to the Committee. This reorganization plan is intended to be implemented after the Russian Detachment is merged. According to the</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>the ranks of police officers are to be divided into six types: first class is foreign superintendents, second class is foreign superintendents recruited locally, third class is Chinese superintendents, fourth class is the Russian Detachment, fifth class is the Indian Division, and sixth class is the Chinese Division. If the above plan can be realized, the foreign division will need to prepare personnel with special qualifications, which will hopefully reduce the number of personnel in the future. At the same time, expenses may be saved as a result. However, the Committee cannot estimate at this time to what extent the personnel can be reduced, nor whether "previous positions should be eliminated." The Committee expresses its support for the previous plan and requests that the Council adopt it. However, under the current circumstances, the Committee cannot formulate the detailed steps for its implementation, and it seems that it is not permissible to engage in reorganization too quickly when crimes are occurring one after another and the situation is complicated.</p>
<p>Shipu and Xikou Bombed Again by Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Two Japanese aircraft flew swiftly over Shipu at 9:00 AM on the 15th, dropping three bombs, including one incendiary bomb. The aircraft then flew to Xikou and dropped three bombs as well. Dozens of houses were destroyed and two people were injured in the attacks.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Concludes, Relief Mission Completed. Relief Committee Held Joint Meeting the Day Before Yesterday. With Sharp Increase in Supplies, Able-bodied Refugees All Dispersed.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee was established during the August 13th Incident (1937) by eight organizations including the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Charity Organizations United Relief Association, the Catholic Action Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Shanghai YMCA, and the Red Swastika Society, as well as Chinese and foreign individuals. It has established six large-scale refugee shelters, two refugee hospitals, one street children's care home, and one refugee children's middle school. It has directly and indirectly sheltered, assisted, and repatriated over 100,000 refugees. From</p>
<p>May 1st of this year,</p>
<p>the Committee stopped accepting donations from all sectors of society because most of the refugees had been repatriated or merged into the refugee shelters of the Refugee Relief Association. It also announced the progress of its work and moved its office to the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association at 97 Renji Road on June 1st to handle the closing procedures and publish an annual report to provide credibility. It is now learned that the Committee is scheduled to hold a general membership meeting at the YMCA family room in the Eight Immortals Bridge area at 5:15 PM today, having already sent letters to the representatives of each participating organization and individuals. At that time, the general affairs, relief, and economic departments of the Committee will present their reports and formally announce the conclusion of the Committee's work. Furthermore, after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, refugees from all over</p>
<p>China gathered in the settlements, reaching a peak of hundreds of thousands of people. Later, they were continuously repatriated. Until recently, there were still over</p>
<p>16,000</p>
<p>people being cared for by various shelters of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the General Charity Association, and the Charity Association Branch. Although the administration is independent, the refugees' supplies are mostly provided by the Refugee Relief Association. The authorities of the Association have found it difficult to manage the increasing donation income due to the recent soaring prices. Previously, the cost of supplies for each refugee was only 1.95 yuan per month, but now it is 10 yuan, a fivefold increase in supply costs. Moreover, continuing to shelter tens of thousands of refugees in the long term and fostering such habits is not a blessing for society. Therefore, at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, responsible personnel from various charitable organizations were convened to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that it was decided to repatriate all able-bodied refugees and to encourage refugees to leave the shelters, the repatriation expenses were specially increased by 4 yuan, that is, 22 yuan for adults and 17 yuan for children. As for the remaining thousand or so elderly, weak, disabled, and young people, it was decided to continue caring for them. The detailed methods of repatriation are still being discussed for a decision.</p>
<p>Gong Bida's Funeral Today</p>
<p>Gong Bida, the Chinese deputy superintendent of the French Concession Police, was assassinated by thugs at the entrance of the alleyway of the Ri Hui Li residence on the Jin Shenfu Road (Avenue Dubail) and Xinxin Street. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but eventually died of his injuries at 10:30 AM on the 14th. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Gong's funeral will be held today (the 17th) at 3:00 PM. Most of the French police will participate in the funeral, and the Public Concession Police will also send representatives. The coffin will remain temporarily placed in the Shanghai Funeral Home.</p>
<h3>French Tramway Labor Dispute, Zha Peilin to Mediate. Labor and Management Not Far Apart in Opinions.</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike of the French tramway workers, negotiations between labor and management have made significant progress in recent days. Former French Municipal Council director, and current Director-General of the Postal Administration, Mr. Zha Peilin, mediated the matter, along with the mediation of the Political Department of the French Police Department, bringing labor and management closer together. According to reports, the most important item for the striking workers, the wage increase, was initially demanded by the labor side to be 11 yuan, and they would not stop until they reached their goal. Now, the workers are no longer insisting on the previous proposal and have reduced it to an 8 yuan wage increase. At the same time, the company authorities have also agreed to increase it by 5.5 yuan. Although this issue has not been fully resolved, the closeness of the conditions can be seen from this. It is expected that after further negotiations, it can be completely resolved and the formal signing date will be within days.</p>
<p>Reported by Western Newspapers, Still in Stalemate</p>
<p>The China Press reports that the French Concession tramway labor dispute is in a stalemate and there is still no change today (the 16th). However, after the strikers held a demonstration yesterday (the 15th), citizens are now worried that the labor dispute will spread to the British tramway and bus companies in the Public Concession within a few days. It is reported that several leaders of the French tramway company strike have tried to incite employees of the two British public transportation companies to strike again, and have threatened them with dire consequences if they do not comply. The French tramway company workers have made demands to the management to resolve the dispute, but there is no apparent progress.</p>
<p>French Liner Arrives in Port Tomorrow, Shanghai-Vietnam Route Resumes, Carrying Over 80,000 Bags of Saigon Rice.</p>
<p>French liners will resume Shanghai-Vietnam services, to be seen in reality tomorrow. The company has increased the number of ships to three, the Loss, Eridan, and Jaros, which were originally cargo ships and previously sailed to various French territories, with the capacity to accommodate large amounts of cargo and passengers. As for the D'Artagnan, it is one of the company's mail ships, which will henceforth operate between Saigon, Haiphong, Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan.</p>
<p>Arriving Tomorrow</p>
<p>the first ship will be the Loss, which will dock at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. The Jaros will arrive in Shanghai on the same afternoon. Both of the above ships are coming to Shanghai from Saigon. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency to the company, the two ships are carrying 7,500 tons of rice loaded in Saigon, approximately 80,000 bags or more. The Loss is scheduled to return directly to Haiphong and Saigon on the 20th, and the Jaros is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 13th. The Eridan is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th and dock at the Washington Wharf, departing for Saigon on the 27th.</p>
<p>The D'Artagnan</p>
<p>mail ship is expected to arrive this month, and will then sail to Kobe, Japan, before coming to Shanghai and sailing to Haiphong and Saigon in French Vietnam. It is reported that the Vietnamese community in this city is scrambling to reserve cabin space on the French liners, and there are also requests to load cargo.</p>
<p>Tsurumi Ken Scheduled to Go to Singapore to Take Office as Japanese Consul-General</p>
<p>Tsurumi Ken, former secretary of the Japanese Embassy and former advisor to the Information Department, is scheduled to take the Haruna Maru liner from Shanghai to Singapore on the 24th of this month to take office as the new Consul-General. Tsurumi's friends are scheduled to host a farewell banquet for Tsurumi at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>General Manager of China General Omnibus Company, Mr. Shaw, Resigns to Join the Military. Mr. Shaw Served in the Air Force During the Last Great War. This Time He Will Work on Mechanical Engineering in Australia.</h3>
<p>Mr. Shaw, engineer and general manager of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, has served for ten years and has recently submitted his resignation in order to join the Royal Australian Air Force. Mr. Shaw's letter of resignation was submitted to the company a long time ago and is expected to be accepted yesterday afternoon. Mr. Shaw will depart Shanghai on the eighth of next month. Members of the Shanghai Club will host a farewell dinner for Mr. Shaw at the club at 17 The Bund today. This is Mr. Shaw's second decision to serve his motherland, as he also served in the Royal Air Force during the Great War. Mr. Shaw is an alert and enthusiastic aviator who has flown several times since 1913. During the last war, he served in both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force. When the British aircraft R-34 first flew across the Atlantic, he was the pilot of the aircraft. This time, Mr. Shaw will join the mechanical engineering division of the Royal Air Force, as he is experienced in this field and can easily do the job. Mr. Shaw, during his service with the Omnibus Company, got along very well with the general reporters in this city. This decision to leave Shanghai is something that people feel very reluctant about.</p>
<p>British Volunteers Continuously Departing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a total of 30 British and American expatriates in this city have volunteered to join the British army and are scheduled to depart this month. The first group of eight British expatriates and one American expatriate left for Malaya and India on Monday afternoon. The second group of six British expatriates left Shanghai this morning (the 16th), with two going to India and four going to Malaya, to receive preliminary training before formally joining the British Army. There are still about twelve people remaining in Shanghai who will depart for Malaya to join the military in early next week. In addition, 25 people who have volunteered to join the British Air Force will be sent by the government and are scheduled to leave Shanghai early next month, possibly going directly to the UK.</p>
<p>British Troops Withdrawing, Fond of Shanghai</p>
<p>After the former British troops stationed in Shanghai, the Seaforth Highlanders and the East Surrey Regiment, were ordered to withdraw from Shanghai successively from the 23rd of last month, they are now concentrating on tactical exercises in Singapore. According to the Straits Times, the British troops, in addition to concentrating on drills with the British troops withdrawing from Tianjin, often engage in sports activities. In general, the British soldiers feel that their duties were very important during their time in Shanghai. Apart from standing guard, they had very little free time, and their lives were extremely monotonous, especially for the East Surrey Regiment stationed in a "bad area." However, their longing for Shanghai is still very strong. The former commander of the British troops stationed in Shanghai and the regimental commanders of the Staffordshire Regiment are also training their subordinates in Singapore, and their lives are very tense.</p>

<h3>Secondary School Teacher Luo Jiahua Submits Articles Conspiring to Extort, Exposing Inside Story of Poor Children's Relief Center, Colluding with Friend Xue Hequn to Extort, Arrested After Restaurant Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center at No. 519, Edward Road, Pujiang Association was formerly founded by Wang and Gao Xiangsheng and others, under the guise of charity, but in fact engaged in fraud and extortion. Last autumn, it was reported by the authorities of the concession police. As a result, Wang was sentenced to five years in prison, while Gao escaped punishment. Later, the center was taken over by Zhang Guoquan, a local, who assumed the position of director and hired prominent social figures as directors, running forty free schools and</p>
<p>Broadcasting Publicly Daily</p>
<p>Raising Funds Extensively, gaining considerable funds. It is found that in addition to serving as the director of the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center, Zhang Guoquan also serves as the manager of Guangming Leitai and the manager of Dajiang Industrial Company, residing at No. 26, Lane 490, Kangti Road, French Concession. On September 27th and 28th of this year, two articles with the name "Charitable Person" Gao Fei suddenly appeared in a local newspaper, and the content revealed the various malpractices of Zhang Guoquan (also known as Gu Yuan), the director of the relief center. Gao Fei's original name is Luo Jiahua, a native of Wuxi, Jiangsu, 26 years old this year, residing at No. 403, Aiwenyi Road, who received higher education and is currently</p>
<p>Working as a Teacher</p>
<p>At the Huanan Middle School on Nanjing Road. Because the salary is meager, he resorts to submitting articles in his spare time. Due to the lack of materials, he suddenly remembers that he was a colleague with Gao Xiangsheng when he was a soldier in Hangzhou, and Gao had told him all about the Poor Children's Relief and the various illegal acts of Director Zhang Guoquan. Therefore, he immediately adopted it as material for writing and publishing articles. His friend Xue Hequn (also known as Li Min, also known as Li Baibing, a native of Suzhou, working as a debt collector in the insurance department of Lihe Foreign Firm, No. 670 Sichuan Road, residing at No. 5, Lianzhuli, Aiwenyi Road) learned about this and colluded with Luo to use this as a means of extortion. On September 29th, Xue Hequn sent a letter to Zhang Guoquan, roughly saying, "A few friends, including Mr. Gao, have written a draft</p>
<p>To Be Published in Newspapers</p>
<p>According to the author, this draft is somewhat implicit and is closely related to your reputation, and the person who provided the material for this topic is a senior staff member of the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center founded by you. In a few days, more explicit manuscripts will be published, and Higher Education has already cut out the published manuscripts and plans to send them to the directors of your center separately. However, I consider you a enthusiastic person in the charitable world. Once the situation expands, your personal reputation is small, and the charitable cause may be affected as a result. I am currently temporarily dissuading this matter, but you must</p>
<p>Answer Honestly</p>
<p>And must meet in person, I wonder what you think, please reply. Phone 11030, Insurance Department of Lihe Foreign Firm, Xue Hequn, phone time daily from 1 PM to 3 PM." The letter also included the two news articles. After receiving the letter, Zhang initially ignored it, but Xue repeatedly called to request a meeting and personally went to the center on October 7th to meet with Zhang. At that time, Luo Jiahua was standing outside the door. At that time, according to Xue, Zhang was required to pay 2,000 yuan in travel expenses so that the author, Mr. Gao, could return to his hometown, but there was no result. Before leaving, Luo also met with Zhang,</p>
<p>Luo Told Zhang</p>
<p>That this matter was quite serious and should not be ignored. In the past, a certain school principal, Chen, was also exposed by newspapers, and the inside story was revealed, and he fled. The lesson of the past can be learned, etc. Afterwards, Xue and others invited Zhang to meet at the Xinxin Tea House and Jingmei Tea House, and agreed to meet again at the Meihua Restaurant at No. 15, Xieqiao Lane, from 3 to 4 PM on the 15th, but must bring at least 1,000 yuan in cash when coming. Zhang reported the information to the Chengdu Road Police Station and sent Chinese detective Ni Runsheng and Western detective Tuilai to secretly wait. After a while, Xue and Luo indeed came and negotiated with Zhang. Zhang handed over a paper bag (containing 200 yuan in legal tender and a bundle of waste paper, disguised as 1,000 yuan) to them for safekeeping,</p>
<p>And Were Arrested by Detectives</p>
<p>In addition to the paper bag, a receipt for 1,000 yuan, three seals, and a seal of Gao Fei were found on Xue's body, and they were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and detailed the above situation, requesting a postponement in order to continue the investigation. According to Zhang Guoquan's complaint, when questioning the two defendants, they denied having extorted money by taking advantage of the situation. Judge Zhong ordered Xue and Luo to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3>Trademark Lawsuit for Door Locks, Defendant Acquitted</h3>
<p>Xinchang Lock Factory at No. 1, Pi Shao Nai Road, French Concession, was established in 1931. The factory owner, He Peiyuan, produces bronze-style door locks with the trademark "606," which are sold widely. Tongchang Hardware Store at No. 509, Zhejiang Road, has also been managing Xinchang Factory's door locks for many years. Recently, Zhang Renzhong of Xinfeng Hardware Store on Kaizi Er Road claimed that he had registered the "606" trademark for</p>
<p>Bronze Door Locks</p>
<p>In 1939 and obtained a registration certificate, believing that He Peiyuan had counterfeited his trademark, and Sun Wenhao, the owner of Tongchang Hardware Store, was guilty of selling goods knowing that they were counterfeit trademarks. He reported to the Laozha Police Station of the Public Concession. Based on the complaint of the plaintiff, Zhang Renzhong, the police station filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Special Court against He Peiyuan and Sun Wenhao for the crime of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. The plaintiff, Zhang Renzhong, also commissioned a lawyer to appear in court with a civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendants, He Peiyuan, etc.</p>
<p>Pay Damages</p>
<p>3,000 yuan. The defendants He Peiyuan and Sun Wenhao jointly hired lawyer Li Wenjie to appear in court to defend them, submitting account books to prove that the plaintiff himself had purchased "606" trademark door locks from the defendant in 1937. At the same time, the chairman of the Hardware Parts Industry Association came to court to testify that Xinchang Lock Factory actually used the "606" trademark first, and Xinfeng Hardware Store requested the association to evaluate the "606" trademark door locks later. Li Wenjie argued that according to the principle of</p>
<p>First Actual Use</p>
<p>In trademark law, the first defendant is legally entitled to request a review of the plaintiff's trademark registration, and in fact, there is already evidence that it is by no means a subsequent imitation, and there is a fundamental lack of criminal intent. The brand is still the defendant's old brand, so he requested the court to declare the defendants not guilty. The case was reviewed by Judge Shi Cong yesterday, and the judgment stated that the defendants He Peiyuan and Sun Wenhao were not guilty, and the plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit was dismissed.</p>

<h3>Large Amount of Copper Blocks Stolen, German National Suspected and Arrested, German National Peng Colluded with White, Arrested by Western Police of Public Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that there was a shocking development in the case of Swiss national White stealing a large amount of copper blocks from the warehouse of the American-owned Ruifeng Transportation Company today (the 16th). German national Peng Te (35 years old) was arrested by the police of the Public Concession at his residence at No. 7, Pike Lane, Hongkou, just after 7:30 this morning for colluding with White. It is reported that the Police Department of the Bureau of Works sent two Western detectives and two Indian detectives to Peng Te's residence, ordered Peng to get up, arrested him, and took him to the Central Police Station. According to Peng's wife, when the police officers carried out the arrest, they did not allow Peng Te to put on clothes and forcibly took him out of his residence, and mistreated him when Peng Te called for help, and then escorted him to the Central Police Station. She immediately took clothes to the police station and handed them to her husband. White said in his apartment in the Broadway Building this morning that the Public Concession police's arrest of Peng Te was a high-handed tactic similar to kidnapping. He has asked a lawyer to visit Mr. Bao Wen, the Police Chief of the Bureau of Works, to ask what crime the police accused Peng Te of, and that the police did not allow him to put on clothes when they escorted Peng Te out, and that the police detained Peng Te in the Central Police Station instead of the Hongkou Police Station, were all "illegal actions." White also admitted that he had not left Shanghai,</p>
<h3>In Memory of Austrian Psychiatrist Professor Wagner-Jauregg (2), The Conqueror of General Paralysis of the Insane, Written by Han Fen, Translated by Xia Chu</h3>
<p>So many years ago, when psychoanalysis was still mixed with arbitrary fantasies, he was an opponent of Freud, another psychiatrist in Vienna. He was alert, intelligent, quick-witted, and his words were barbed, often embarrassing his opponents. Some of us still remember that once, when he was routinely inspecting the wards of the hospital, a madwoman was telling her dreams. A group of famous psychoanalysts were listening attentively, and the air seemed very serious, but Professor Hua came to disturb them, and he jokingly asked: "What does your witch dream book say about this?"</p>
<p>He had several disciples who were too ambitious and liked to publish many books, and he often ridiculed this large output of scientific research. One day, we learned that the Nobel Prize had been awarded to our septuagenarian teacher, and the colleagues in the hospital who had a close relationship with him gathered to celebrate. He quickly thanked them with these words: "I believe that some of you will also win the Nobel Prize, and even if you don't win a scientific prize, you can still win a literary prize." A few days later, he was celebrated again, and he tried his best to say that after winning "such a Nobel Prize," it was of great benefit to one's medical skills: "As long as I prescribe it to the patient, even if it is a Chinese medicine, it will work."</p>
<p>The scientific problems that this great researcher was interested in were many, but his greatest achievement was the invention of the "Malaria Inoculation Therapy," which made him famous worldwide and put him on par with the greatest authorities in the medical world.</p>
<p>Wagner-Jauregg's participation in the fight against the syphilis spirochete was completely unexpected. The "White Terror" played tricks on its victims in various ways, and the scientists who fought against it were initially disheartened. Three years after Bordet and Wassermann invented the syphilis transmission test, Ehrlich invented his magic bullet to treat syphilis—606. But 606 was not completely done, and it was not enough to relieve the patient's external pain. There were still tens of millions of people, accounting for 10% of syphilis patients, who, although they had received the 606 therapy, still had syphilis spirochetes hidden in their nervous systems. Nothing could be seen on the outside, but after ten, twenty, or thirty years, these people's old problems would recur, and their whole bodies would be paralyzed. In 1914, bismuth agents. Despite the extensive use of bismuth agents, their cerebrospinal fluid still had a positive Wassermann reaction, which was enough to prove that the spirochetes were still alive, waiting for the chance to deliver the final fatal blow.</p>
<p>"General paralysis is incurable, and within a few years, the patient will completely lose consciousness and die." This was the general opinion about this disease before Wagner-Jauregg's time.</p>
<p>In 1887, Wagner noticed that the condition of several paralyzed patients would improve if they contracted an infectious disease. Wagner was very eccentric and believed in experience more than theory, but now he also delved into ancient books. He read that the semi-legendary and semi-historical Greek Hippocrates had discovered that if epileptics contracted malaria, their epilepsy would be cured suddenly. From the perspective of modern science, these things can only be regarded as mythology. If Wagner wanted to draw scientific conclusions from these observations, he would have to have courage and he would have to have genius to think of how to intentionally imitate this natural experiment. So he proposed that hopeless madmen should be allowed to contract erysipelas or malaria. No one in Europe listened to him, and no one even opposed him.</p>
<p>In 1890, Wagner began to treat several mental patients with erysipelas, and later he used Koch's Tuberculin, which caused a global shock. In 1900, his interest shifted to the treatment of general paralysis, and some of these patients had particularly good reactions to Tuberculin. However, the patients cured by this method often relapsed, and their madness could no longer be stopped by this method. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Special Honor Tickets to Continue Competitive Purchase This Afternoon; Shanghai-Qingdao Postponement Issue Largely Untrue; West Qingdao Giants Challenge Paramount B Accepted</h3>
<p>The final act of the charity basketball challenge, Shanghai-Qingdao versus Paramount, is scheduled for this Saturday. This is the focus of much excitement, and therefore of great concern to the general public. Moreover, the increased value of the tickets and the sale of special honor tickets have made this event an unprecedented record in the Far East. Currently, seat number one has been competitively purchased by an old Mrs. Li and Messrs. Zhu and Zhang. However, no winner was determined yesterday. The competitive bidding will continue this afternoon, from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM. The telephone numbers are 14121 and 10299. As for the rumored postponement of the Shanghai-Qingdao match, the team has worked hard to ensure that this does not happen. Furthermore, the West Qingdao B team champion, the Giants, after defeating Nanyang the previous week, has also challenged Paramount's B team, and Paramount B has accepted. Therefore, in addition to the main match, there will be two intermissions: a women's demonstration match between Youyou and Jingwu, and a Sino-Western showdown between Paramount B and the Giants.</p>
<h3>Competitive Purchase Situation for Special Ticket Number One</h3>
<p>When the competitive purchase of the special honor seat ticket began yesterday, an old Mrs. Li, residing at 10 Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road, first telephoned Mr. Yuan Ludeng, expressing her willingness to purchase the first ticket for 200 yuan. If there were other bidders, she asked Mr. Yuan to send someone to inform her. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Zhu (who wishes to remain anonymous) and Mr. Zhang Chengyi also expressed their willingness to purchase at the same value. However, they did not exceed the stipulated standard price of 200 yuan, presumably due to mistakenly believing each ticket was 200 yuan and not paying attention to the competition. Therefore, the auction will continue today in the hope of enthusiastic participation from all sectors. It is noted that old Mrs. Li is the mother of Mr. Li Hengzhai, the industrial magnate who purchased the ball for 1,100 yuan last week.</p>
<h3>Slight Hiccup with Telephone Numbers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because the telephone numbers were not included in the news reports, the great benefactors who wished to participate in the competitive purchase suffered from a lack of information. Mr. Yuan's residence also received many calls regarding the auction yesterday. However, as the residents were unaware of the details, they turned down all calls. Mr. Yuan expressed his deep apologies to the great benefactors who were unable to get through yesterday and has decided to continue the auction today to avoid any omissions.</p>
<h3>Twelve Celebrities Sign the Tickets</h3>
<p>There are a total of ten special honor seat tickets, handwritten by Mr. Yuan. The tickets are made of domestically produced white silk with a red border, and the design is elegant and exquisite. In addition to Mr. Yuan's handwriting, the tickets also feature the signatures of twelve Chinese and foreign celebrities, including Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Xu Jiying, He Dekui, as well as Mr. Philippe, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, Mr. Catstuwe, the Chairman of the Board, and Captain George Little, the British Consul. The occasion is solemn and grand. The leaders and captains of both the Paramount and Shanghai-Qingdao teams will also sign the tickets to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Qingdao Postponement Unlikely</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Qingdao postponement issue, according to the team's coach, Mr. Qian Xucang, the Shanghai-Qingdao team did express a desire to postpone the match due to Chen Xuechong's absence in Hong Kong and Da Mao's and Ren Xiangcheng's illnesses or injuries. However, Ren Xiangcheng's illness in Shanghai has slightly improved. If he does not develop a high fever again today, he should be able to play after a day or two of rest. Da Mao's injury is expected to heal within a day or two. Xuechong went to Hong Kong last Tuesday and is expected to return to Shanghai in a week, so it is possible he will arrive on time. In short, for the sake of charity, winning or losing is not important. Therefore, they are making every effort to ensure that the match is not postponed.</p>

Jin Cheng, on the other hand, had an even distribution of talent. As a result, they defeated HSBC 13 to 5. In another match, Citibank and Zikang met at the Siming table tennis room. The former is a strong team in the banking sector, while the latter is the champion in the Qian industry. The two sides were evenly matched, resulting in a very tense match. In the end, Citibank forcefully defeated Zikang 13 to 11, a hard-won victory. Today, there will be a total of five matches. It is expected that the first four matches will be one-sided.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Hong Kong Stomach is Full; Cotton Cloth Suddenly Drops; Shuangma Falls Back 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which rose sharply and then fell sharply the day before yesterday, turned to a decline yesterday. This is because Hong Kong has been buying goods for several consecutive days, and the amount is very large. It seems that it is now full and needs to be digested before more can be purchased. As a result, some bulls came out one after another, and the market became softer. However, a certain major player is still absorbing, but the price range has entered a high level. Once an unfavorable environment is encountered, the reaction may be drastic. Therefore, the trend in the past two days has been chaotic and inconsistent, and it changes in an instant. It is conceivable that buying long and selling short is unpredictable. Today, 3,590 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn market this morning was still enthusiastic, and the momentum of the bulls did not diminish. The opening price was 1,250 yuan, up 10 yuan. However, because the actual demand from the Guangdong merchants was not strong, the factory orders for Shuangma were sold, and soon the price fell slightly to 1,140 yuan. However, the bulls' pull was extremely strong, and it rose again to 1,246-47 yuan. Back and forth between these 40 yuan and 47 yuan, it took no less than two hours. It is conceivable that the battle between the bulls and bears was fierce. Near 11 o'clock, it was heard that Lan Fengbiao yarn had fallen, and Japanese yarn was also weak. As a result, the overall trend was gone, and the bulls were unable to do anything. The market slowly fell, plunging to 1,218 yuan. The closing price was 1,222 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume in half a day can be 5,040 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 30 yuan. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow merchants 4,800; Hong Kong 240; Total 5,040</p>
<h3>Talk: What Was Heard in the Yarn Market; Let's See What Happens in the Future</h3>
<p>Recently, the cotton yarn situation has seen new developments in every market, with new forces joining the ranks and becoming more and more enthusiastic. As a result, the market is crowded with people, like flies gathering on carrion and ants gathering on something sweet. It is conceivable to imagine the excitement and commotion. The author heard two people, A and B, discussing the principles of the yarn market. It is worth recording to inform the readers.</p>
<p>A said: "Certain individuals colluded with stockbrokers, securities firms, and gold merchants to continuously absorb 4,000 to 5,000 bales of 20-count Shuangma factory orders, keeping them closed and not releasing them. The chips on the table suddenly became scarce. Therefore, although the factory sells every day, only dragging in is seen in the market, and more and more is dragged in. The market only sees big, not small."</p>
<p>B said: "Since the establishment of the 'Exchange,' the price of yarn has been rising in a straight line. 42-count has risen by 400 to 500 yuan, 60-count is jumping over 1,000 yuan, and 20-count yarn has also risen by 300 to 400 yuan on average. Although there are major players manipulating the current base, it has entered a high level. If actual sales are sluggish and do not improve, and the goods absorbed by the major players have a reaction, then the situation will be unknown. The factory's profit for manufacturing a bale of yarn is over 200 yuan. After the peak seen the day before yesterday, many parties slightly spit out. 60-count has fallen back by 300 yuan, 42-count has fallen by 100 yuan, and 20-count has fallen by 50 to 60 yuan. Currently, everyone is standing on a snake's back. If the pace is not synchronized, they are afraid of slipping away."</p>
<p>The two brothers were talking with great interest. The author listened from the side, and it was indeed the truth. Whether it can be avoided is another matter. The greatest observation of those who are dragging in all the time is that "China's cotton production can almost be said to be completely unified by the Japanese." In addition, with the storm between Japan and the United States brewing, whether American cotton can be supplied is a problem. Those who do yarn and cotton business generally believe that the opportunity has arrived, as if buying in will immediately make a fortune, compensating for their losses in the past half year and reliving their good old dreams. In fact, it may not be so. Don't think that "cotton yarn" and "white rice" are both "staple food business" and want to make a fortune from everyone. You should know whether it can be realized in the future. Even if it is realized, can you be allowed to make money? Those who have good dreams, think about it on a quiet night! (Shan)</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Firm, Business Between Dealers is Lively</h3>
<p>The cotton trade today is not as strong as the previous day, but people's confidence remains firm. The factory's demand is still cold. However, business between dealers is very lively.</p>
<p>In other news, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was active again yesterday. First, due to purchases by dealers, and then due to the improvement in Wall Street stock prices and purchases by stock speculators in the market, the closing price was up three to five points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures also rose by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has recently become increasingly lively. The factory's demand is very strong. Dealers' confidence continues to be high. Therefore, it is very difficult for factories to purchase cotton. Dealers, in order to alleviate the cotton shortage in Shanghai, have successively ordered goods to be shipped.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yarn and Thread Fall, Cloth Market Also Drops</h3>
<p>National Cloth: The cloth market fell back yesterday, but the trend is still stable. This is because the price of raw yarn has fallen sharply, people's confidence is weak, and speculators are selling. Fine cloth and twill fell by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Coarse cloth was flat. Colored cloth and colored twill also fell by about 5 cents. Factory prices remained firm, but transactions suddenly became sluggish. Most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The total transaction volume on this street was more than 300 pieces. Fujian merchants bought more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants bought more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth. Yantai merchants in the north road imported more than 100 pieces of heavyweight coarse cloth. More than 3,000 pieces of dyed and bleached cloth were purchased from Singapore and other places abroad. Today, 695 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, with the continued decline in yarn and thread, general speculators were nervous and sold off, and the market gradually declined. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at 37 yuan and 9 cents, and fell to 37 yuan and 1 cent. However, dealers' confidence remained good, and their willingness to buy did not diminish. Therefore, the market turned firm again at the close, at 37 yuan and 4 cents. The price of Sijunzi serge fell to 1 yuan, 1 cent, 3 cents and 7.5 li per yard.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics: Only Women's Overcoats are Selling Well</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric trade was lively yesterday. The retail and wholesale sales of each store were quite prosperous. Women's colored woolen fabrics were selling particularly well. Stores selling miscellaneous colored woolen fabrics, such as red, blue, green, purple, yellow, and cyan, were all crowded, regardless of whether they were shiny or matte. Generally, ladies patronized them, and they were overwhelmed with customers. Fashion stores on Section Four of the Malu Road and Avenue Joffre, which also sold qipao materials, also had quite prosperous business. Looking at the woolen fabric stores in the Qipan Street area and the silk, satin, foreign goods, and woolen fabric departments on Nanjing Road, the daily sales of women's colored woolen fabrics have exceeded those of men's colored woolen fabrics. It can also be seen that in today's special environment, women spend money much more readily than men.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Rises and Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>The securities market continued to fluctuate yesterday, with prices rising and falling between 5 cents and 1 cent. Both bulls and bears were watching each other. Transactions were reduced, and the dull situation was not easy to break. Transactions on account by various merchants also gradually decreased, because both bulls and bears had no definite confidence and were waiting for the situation to unfold. Yesterday's transactions were unusually low in the morning, and slightly improved in the afternoon. Most were closing transactions. Buyers and sellers were completely different. There was no one who consistently bought or sold. The market was sluggish and people's confidence was flagging. Prices fluctuated between 5 cents and 1 cent throughout the day. In the end, prices were slightly lower by 1 cent to 2-3 cents across the board. The total transaction volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 500 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 23 yuan and 8 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the public enterprise stock market was good, and prices showed signs of rising. However, various rumors soon arose, and transactions decreased. People's confidence reappeared in fatigue. Given the current uncertain situation, the market is difficult to develop for the time being.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Wednesday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remain flat. Only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's UK-registered shares slightly rebounded, rising 1.5 pounds to a price of 58.5 pounds. Also, Hong Kong-registered shares still stand at 70 pounds, with prices but no transactions. The rest are unchanged.</p>
<p>The British Malayan Rubber Estate, managed by Huitong Foreign Company, will pay an interim dividend of 1 yuan per share on October 29th.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Sellers More Active</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market today, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing price showed no change. The black market for British and American exchange rates showed signs of loosening. Originally, due to the unfavorable environment and people's loosening confidence, sales were extremely aggressive. The opening was hard, but as news of the conflict between Japan and the United States spread near noon, sellers became more active. Conversely, there were few buyers. The highest price for American exchange reached 5.875 yuan. The market at the close was still calm. In the end, British was loose 0.03125, American was hard 0.0625. The trend of futures was similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>Very Few Buyers</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the price of London large bills, both near and far terms, rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat. London gold spot prices remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American remained unchanged, but it fell by 0.03125 to Shanghai. The exchange rates of American to British and Shanghai were all flat. There was no market for French. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 3 pence, 78125 for British gold and 5.78125 yuan for American exchange. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, both British and American exchange rates had no change. After the opening, speculators poured into the market. At the same time, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also sold. The price was quite loose and hard. It is estimated that China Commercial Bank, Continental Bank, Shanghai Bank, and Yuli Bank bought the November American exchange rate at 5.8125 yuan. The current month was quoted at 5.84375 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing price was not disclosed. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 0.25%. Thereafter, China Commercial Bank once spat out the price of British gold at 3 pence, 8125 for the current month to foreign banks. Later, around 11:30, more unfavorable news such as the conflict between Japan and the United States was spread, and speculators continued to sell. The underlying potential grew rapidly. At that time, the foreign bank entered the speculators at 5.875 yuan for the current month's American exchange. Later, the Japanese bank came to pay and the trend slightly turned around. The Japanese bank of the current month, the foreign bank quoted 5.84375 yuan for American exchange. The market at the close was still quiet. It is estimated that British gold was 3 pence, 8125, and American exchange was 5.84375 yuan. The current month was the same as the spot price. November British gold was 3 pence, 796875, and American exchange was 5.8125 yuan.

The New York telegraphic transfer was unchanged, still standing at 5.53125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rose by 5 cents to 104.5 yuan (the previous opening was 104 yuan). The "Joint Note" black market continued to cheapen by 1 yuan, to 80.075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Chips, Limited Fall in Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market resulted in a setback despite the looseness and hardness of the foreign exchange market. However, because the silver supply has been unusually loose recently, those who are long are thinking of collecting cash and generally paying in cash. Moreover, due to the shortage of chips, the shorts are unable to exert their power. Therefore, although the fall is limited, the transaction volume is small and the fluctuations have increased. The situation was still bullish at the beginning of the morning. After fluctuating for a while, it was heard that the exchange market had risen sharply, and the lowest price plummeted to 5,630 yuan. The closing price was pulled up by 10 yuan, to 5,640 yuan, which was 5 yuan less than the previous day. The half-day transaction volume was 2,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops was unchanged. Customs gold and other items remained flat.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the opening price was raised due to the stable confidence of the people. It is estimated that a gold shop entered 10 taels from the securities firm at 5,670 yuan. Later, the gold shop entered 20 taels from the silver shop at 5,680 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was loosening, and silver shops and securities firms came to sell off, falling by dozens of yuan. It is estimated that the silver shop paid 20 taels for the cash exchange business at 5,640 yuan. A little later, the silver shop suddenly thought of covering its short position, and a certain household engaged in the cash exchange business also searched for and bought a lot, so the price rebounded. The silver shop paid 20 taels for the cash exchange business, already as high as 5,715 yuan. However, soon the gold shops and others frantically spit out and the price fell again. It is estimated that the gold shop sold 10 taels to the silver shop at 5,650 yuan, and sold 20 taels to the securities firm at 5,685 yuan, and the lowest price was only 5,630 yuan for the silver shop to enter the silver shop. The cash exchange business entered 10 taels from the silver shop at noon, quoted at 5,640 yuan. As a result, it was 5 yuan less than the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The fluctuations in half a day were 85 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold from the cash gold shop was more than 10 yuan higher, and the purchase price was more than 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was quoted at more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price. Both were rarely done.</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. It is estimated that Datonghang hung up 580 yuan, and the price of Xintonghang was similar to the above price, with the purchase price being about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Chinese Bank's 100 Yuan Note Already in Circulation on the Market</h3>
<p>The 100 yuan note recently issued by the Bank of China has been found in the market. The note was printed by the American Bank Note Company. The patterns on both sides are dark cyan. The name of the Bank of China is at the top of the front, and the portrait of the Founding Father is in an oval on the left corner. The number 100 is listed horizontally in the pattern on the right. Below it are the small characters of August 29th, Republic of China, and the bottom is light green with the words "100 Yuan" in hollow letters. The English name of the bank is on the upper left of the back, and the Arabic numerals are below it. The English word "Hundred Yuan" is listed horizontally at the bottom. The Temple of Heaven is in the oval on the right corner. This note has no place name and is universally used like the Shanghai notes.</p>

<h3>American僑 Return Home, Demand for American Dollar Tickets</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign currency market, the spot price of gold rose and then returned to flat. Therefore, the prices of British and American gold pounds rose and then returned to flat. There were still few transactions in American dollar tickets. The market price still stood at the original level. American dollar tickets initially experienced strong demand due to a small number of American 僑 returning home. Therefore, the market was still firm. Later, the black market American exchange rate loosened, and the supply from all parties was very strong. The evening market retreated to 16 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, which was 2 jiao and 2 fen less than the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket fell by 2 fen along with the decline in the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were still very firm. The former was 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7.5 fen, and the latter was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice Busily Bought; New Jing Rice Flooding In</h3>
<p>The opening price of foreign rice yesterday morning was weak, because after the fatigue of the previous day, actual sales were even more sluggish. The industry and hoarders estimated that the total transaction volume before and after this decision reached 250,000 bags, and there were other sporadic purchases and direct shipments. In total, there were at least 300,000 bags. Moreover, another batch of 50,000 bags has been scheduled to arrive the day after tomorrow. Others have also been shipped in batches. Shenji Foreign Company and others were still in contact yesterday for 1,300 tons of No. 2 Saigon (Gong and Miluo). If a decision is reached, it will further increase the supply. Therefore, the spot price of foreign rice was small at the start, and then various hoarders absorbed at the flat price. The mid-market rebounded again, and Hualun Si then traded more than 200 tons. Both near and far terms opened at 75 yuan. Transactions were light in the afternoon, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>The source of new Jingjian and Yaozhong rice continued to flood in yesterday, with no less than 4,000 bags. However, there was a limited amount of Zhongxin Jian. Most of them belonged to Jing goods. Therefore, the Jing market continued to show an imbalance between supply and demand, and continued to fall by about 2 yuan. If Minhang new Jing only opened at 78 yuan per original bag, 75 yuan per hu, and decided to reach 73.5 yuan. Qingjiao Yaozhong was 75 yuan. There was no market for Baige. Foreign Dujian goods were rarely standing still. The original bags all opened at 70 yuan. However, Dujian was 66-67 yuan per hu. Sijing Yetao has also been put on the market, opening at 79 yuan. Breaking the dragon is already an order, with no major entry or exit, similar to the previous market. The current price of glutinous rice, after a period of soaring, has not declined, but the price is not easy to increase, showing a situation of no change.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is coming one after another. Huarun Foreign Company's ESSI, represented by China Communications Navigation Company, transported 14,648 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port at noon yesterday and docked at the French Concession Observatory Wharf to unload. A large amount of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, transported directly by French ships from Saigon.</p>
<h3>Damaged Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Shen Yun</p>
<p>Although banknotes are printed on tough paper, they are easily damaged through repeated handling. Moreover, during times of war, people often bury banknotes underground or hide them in secret, inconspicuous places to preserve them, which makes them susceptible to mold and fragmentation. Damage can also be caused by insects or fire, resulting in incomplete banknotes. Many people are unaware of the procedures for exchanging such damaged banknotes. As a result, money exchange shops are prevalent on almost every street. Those who hold damaged banknotes are unaware of the exchange procedures and, finding it convenient to exchange them there, reluctantly accept losses. However, the total of these losses can be quite considerable. For example, a family might suffer from the disasters of war, already losing their home and possessions. To then have their remaining assets, "damaged banknotes," further exploited adds to their suffering.</p>
<p>Currently, the Ministry of Finance has established regulations for the exchange of damaged banknotes and has instructed post offices throughout the country to display notices and provide free exchanges to alleviate the people's hardship. However, the public is not yet fully aware of this. Furthermore, Shanghai is a place of refuge for people from all regions, and a large number of these damaged banknotes are concentrated in Shanghai. The issuing banks are located far in the western district of the French Concession, and their exchange locations are often monopolized by apprentices from small money shops and opium dens. Individuals going to exchange banknotes might wait all day and still not be able to exchange them, leaving them no choice but to endure the exploitation of these shops. If this continues without appropriate measures to facilitate the public and eliminate these exchange shops, it would fall short of the banks' mission to serve society. In my humble opinion, each issuing bank has branch offices in important locations in the city. If these branches could also handle the exchange of damaged banknotes, instead of only the main branch, those with damaged banknotes could exchange them nearby, avoiding long journeys. The Ministry of Finance's exchange regulations should also be clearly announced and posted in visible locations so that those coming to exchange banknotes are aware of the procedures. This would not only prevent excessive exploitation by money exchange shops but also avoid verbal disputes when damaged banknotes cannot be exchanged for their full value. According to the banks' rules for exchanging damaged banknotes, the amount to be exchanged, whether full value, half value, or no value, is determined by the degree of damage to the banknote. There are no discounts of 20% or 30% (these are all ways money exchange shops knowingly profit by taking advantage of those unaware of the exchange procedures. They offer 20% or 30% discounts on banknotes that can be exchanged for full value, bargaining for a better price, and fooling those who don't know any better). For instance, someone might take a ten-yuan damaged banknote to the bank for exchange. According to the regulations, the extent of the damage only warrants half the value, but the person may not know the exchange procedures and argue with the bank clerk for seven or eight yuan. This wastes both time and words. If the exchange procedures were clearly announced, such disputes could be avoided. Furthermore, I urge the bank authorities to consider making exceptions for legitimate merchants or impoverished individuals whose banknotes are not intentionally damaged or whose damage is excusable, exchanging them at full or half value. This would not harm the banks but would greatly benefit those seeking the exchange. The Ministry of Finance's regulations for the exchange of damaged banknotes are explained below: (1) If the banknote is torn but more than three-quarters of it remains, it should be exchanged for its full value.</p>

<h3>Flour Remains Firm, Wheat Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, spot transactions were sluggish, but the market remained firm. Second-grade flour from the factory was still quoted at $16.50, and wholesale offers were at $18.50, with no full amounts being sold. The supply of recycled goods on the market has dried up early. Although asking prices are high, there are no formal transactions. Only a small amount of foreign flour is available as a supplement. It is reported that the "Triangle" brand foreign flour handled by Tianjin Xin Sheng Commercial Company was sold for $18.45 to $18.50 per bag through the local office, with 1,000 bags transacted. "High Brand Fortune Longevity" foreign flour was priced at $19.55 to $19.60, with a few transactions also taking place. Amid the difficulties in transporting foreign flour to China due to wartime insurance issues, public sentiment has not eased. However, actual sales have not expanded, so the market remains firm and quiet.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market conditions were quite stagnant, as both domestic and foreign sources were difficult to access. Shanghai's inventory is low, and suppliers are trying to maintain prices. However, Japanese factories, due to the ban on the sale of "Phoenix" flour in the concession areas, have a subdued demand for raw materials, limiting the price to around $21. Chinese factories are offering $25 for purchases, but there is still no stock available.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oil Prices Fall Again, Speculators' Ambitions Run High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shantou oil market saw another drop of $3-4. Transactions included 50 units of Jiaozhou soybean oil at $77, 300 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil at $88 and $86, 300 units of Jiaozhou raw oil at $76.50 to $76, and 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at $106. The 700 barrels to be delivered in the first half of November have seen many price fluctuations, rising and falling from $106.50, peaking at $107.75, then falling back to $106. The market closed with 300 tins of Jiangbei raw oil trading at $101.50 to $100. Observations suggest that the supply chain for future deliveries is still abundant. Currently, there is a strong demand from the interior, so powerful players are boldly hoarding, waiting for the chance to release evidence of performance and sell at a good price. However, temporarily, inventories are congested, and the trend is inevitably overshadowed by sluggishness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,750 tins of raw oil arrived from Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Coal: Ample Coal Dust Inventory</h3>
<p>Besides a batch of white coal dust that arrived last week, the inventory in various warehouses in the city is quite substantial. It is reported that a coal briquette factory in Pudong has a stockpile of over 7,000 tons of "New Hong" dust. Warehouses in the concession areas also hold similar amounts. Therefore, with ample inventory, public sentiment is stable. Yesterday, inter-dealer clearing prices opened at $124 per ton for "Hongji No. 1" dust and $110 for "Cannon" dust, showing no significant change from last week.</p>

<h3>The Sparrow and the Swan</h3>
<p>— Zhou Suifu</p>
<p>The sparrow, with mud and grass in its beak, was busily flying back and forth, building its nest, without stopping or resting. Suddenly, it saw a swan standing on a high branch nearby, leisurely as if in deep thought.</p>
<p>The sparrow flew over and curiously asked, "What are you doing standing here?"</p>
<p>The swan turned its head, saw the sparrow, seemed a little disdainful, glanced at it, and remained silent.</p>
<p>The sparrow, simple-minded, couldn't help but ask again, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The swan sighed deeply, raised its head, and looked at the sky, saying so depressingly, "How could you know my aspirations!"</p>
<p>The sparrow seemed a little ashamed, blushed, and flew away, continuing to build its nest in a hurry. It had already forgotten what had just happened; it was only concerned with its work; it was happy with its practical work. The sparrow's nest was built, it had a "home," and it received a reward for its practical work. But the swan was still on the high branch, sighing. It had great ambitions, but disdained to do small things; it was waiting for its work to come.</p>
<p>Time passes without stopping, the sparrow is busy working, and the swan is sighing. Is it that the sparrow doesn't understand the swan's ambitions, or is the swan not as good as the sparrow?</p>
<p>Essay</p>
<h3>Walking in the Rain</h3>
<p>— Liu Yikui</p>
<p>……I can't stand it anymore, I want to jump out of this house! It's not wrong to call this house "a vehicle", it's just like a carriage—a narrow and cramped carriage; stuffy, hot and moldy, suffocating!</p>
<p>Outside is a gloomy scene, as gloomy as a troubled face; however, the raindrops seem to be thinning out again. Perhaps a troubled person also cherishes his hot tears! I decisively jumped out of the door and strode forward into the rain...</p>
<p>The houses seemed even more lonely after being beaten by the rain, each appearing taller and colder. On the street, the rickshaw pullers' strong legs splashed water as they hurried along. Carriages, each resembling a small house, sometimes lined up, gliding by like a moving alleyway.</p>
<p>By the roadside, a man with a broken leg was laboriously crawling. His soaked clothes seemed impervious to the raindrops; or perhaps he was unaware of the rain, which was relentlessly pelting him. Is it that those who suffer, having endured much, no longer fear suffering? Or has the torment of suffering numbed his senses? I do not know. Although I didn't run in the street holding an umbrella, I faced the rain in dry, warm clothes. And I knew: even if the rain soaked them through, my clothes would still be warm and hot due to my body temperature and the resentment in my heart.</p>
<p>But I understood, as I approached the man with the broken leg, his sharp gaze and low cries under his disheveled hair seized my heart and pace. He trembled, raising his hand, smeared with mud and dirty water, and said intermittently:</p>
<p>"...Have pity—I'm a disabled veteran!...His clothes are so cold—it's killing him!...I used to...fight in the war!..." Then came several calls of "Sir! Boss!" uttered in a spasmodic manner. I clearly saw that the wind and rain had battered and wounded this once robust man: and now, he has forgotten the joy of victory over the wind and rain. He has been defeated by another kind of storm!</p>
<p>I opened my wallet and gave him some of the few coins I had. Afterward, I said in a low voice to his back, as if to myself, "This is not an act of compassion for a man with a broken leg, but rather my admiration for a warrior who fought against the wind and rain before his leg was broken!..."</p>
<p>"Have pity on this old soldier!" His cry seemed to still be trembling and echoing, as if I could hear the grief and indignation in his heart: he fought to resist violence, for the survival of everyone! He sacrificed himself! Yet those who rely on their blood to maintain warmth and comfort have now forgotten where that comfort and warmth come from. They mostly rolled their eyes, raised the sound of their leather shoes, spat, and ran away from this suffering man who was corroded by poverty and covered in layers of filth and stench. And he, he lingered alone outside of warmth, comfort, and well-being. In the wind and rain, the rain blurred my glasses, I only realized this when I looked back at the old soldier. I quickly took off my glasses and saw a mass crawling on the ground, turning into an alley.</p>
<p>I let my eyes directly face the raindrops. Although my vision wasn't necessarily clearer this way, my hot eye sockets were cool and comfortable.</p>
<p>I strode on in silence...Suddenly, it seemed like something was rushing towards me. Closer, with a thunderous shout, I quickly dodged this yellow car that seemed like a house. The car sped on.</p>
<p>Who is controlling him to run like cattle and horses? Who is whipping him, making him willingly rush ahead desperately all day long? I felt that his shout just now was not a hateful, imposing threat, but rather like the pitiful cry of a cattle or horse being whipped.</p>
<p>He is not as free as a legless veteran! Although he has legs, and can brave the wind and rain, and can shout for others to avoid him....</p>
<p>But then, I realized; wasn't I just like that rickshaw puller, with the rickshaw to pull, my house is the one I rented myself; the passengers in my rickshaw are more than what he pulls now!....But I was finally able to jump out temporarily, and walk into the wind and rain with the legless veteran.</p>
<p>When will I be able to be a young soldier? I asked myself in the increasing rain.</p>
<p>The rain grew heavier, and cars splashed water on passersby, carrying away the laughter inside.</p>
<p>In the rain, I remembered that someone seemed to have said before: "There will definitely be a clear day after a heavy rain, and that clear day will especially make people feel its warmth, beauty, and brightness."</p>
<p>Therefore, my pace became even stronger.</p>
<h3>Elementary Entomology</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>The length of a flea's thigh is one-twentieth of an inch, but it can jump thirteen inches far and seven and three-quarters inches high. If the distance of a jump is based solely on the length of the hind legs, then the length of our thighs, calculated at three feet, would require us to jump seven hundred feet far and four hundred and fifty feet high.</p>
<p>Each compound eye of an ant is composed of forty to fifty small eyes. Each compound eye of a housefly contains over four thousand small eyes. A butterfly's small eyes number 17,000, while the two compound eyes of a moth or dragonfly each contain 50,000 small eyes. Although most insects have complete visual organs, there are also a few species of insects whose eyes are completely absent.</p>
<p>Humans have four hundred to five hundred muscles in their entire body, but insects have ten to fifteen times more muscles in their entire body than humans.</p>
<p>If a pair of flies begins to reproduce at the beginning of April, and none of their offspring die, and they continue to reproduce until August of the same year, there will be 19,010,000,000,000,000,000,000 flies living in the world. If each fly is sized at one-eighth of a cubic inch, the above number of flies will accumulate on the entire surface of the earth to a height of forty-seven feet.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Astonishing News</p>
<p>I flicked off some ash and silently took a few puffs of my cigarette, unable to help but sigh. I admit that a part of our country's politics has indeed not yet gotten on the right track. Because the spirit of democracy lies in everyone abiding by the law. As an official, every move he makes must not arbitrarily exceed the scope of the law. Director Cui has not had a bad reputation for governance in the past, but this action is obviously illegal. Hawthorne's visit to the director will naturally focus on this point. Although he assured me that I wouldn't clash with the director, I was genuinely worried about him.</p>
<p>I also thought about how Hawthorne told me before he left to talk to Li Zhiban about his son Shouqi. Hawthorne had long placed Shouqi in the circle of suspects, but he lacked factual evidence, only having an idea. Now, according to Anna's explanation of his marital dispute with Liland, his suspicion has naturally suddenly increased. Although Old Mao said that he returned to Suzhou early yesterday morning, this fact has not been proven. He may have pretended to return to Suzhou, but actually hid somewhere, and then went to Liland's house to commit the crime last night in the rain. However, I'm sure that I won't be able to get any results from asking his father, Li Zhiban, about this matter. First, the old man may not know; second, even if he does know, he will definitely not readily tell me about his son's crime.</p>
<p>I threw away my cigarette butt and speculated about the course of the case. Initially, the difficulty we encountered was that, in terms of time, the murderer would not have had enough time to go in and steal the jewelry from Liland after the gunshot. Now, it can be assumed that the real murderer clearly stabbed Liland to death with a knife before the shooting; after stabbing her to death, he took the jewelry out; after that, Zhao Boxiong stood outside the low wall and fired a shot; in this way, the contradiction in time can indeed be resolved. But who is the murderer who stabbed with a knife? Is it really Li Shouqi? Why didn't Liland struggle or call for help when she was stabbed? And there was still leftover wine on the table, as if she was politely entertaining the murderer, which is also incomprehensible. Also, the leather shoes on Old Mao's feet did indeed resemble that footprint. If so, why did he secretly go in? Because according to his confession, he didn't admit to this point. Then, could it be that Old Mao suddenly saw the money and committed the crime?</p>
<p>The hands on my watch were already pointing at three o'clock. I gave up this fruitless speculation, told Shi Gui, and set off for the Wang family's house. Sitting in the rickshaw, I was still hesitant about how to phrase things when I met Li Zhiban. Because I want to investigate Li Shouqi's movements, I have to be careful, so as not to arouse his suspicion. However, this effort of mine was in vain, I composed several steps for conversation, but they were actually useless. (138)</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Peking Opera School</h3>
<p>— Dagui</p>
<p>Peking Opera schools are filled with talent and have achieved remarkable results. The most prestigious is undoubtedly the Fuliancheng school in Beiping. After the founding of the Republic, southern opera schools that performed in Shanghai included the "Hangzhou Little Troupe" at the Xiuyuntian Amusement Park (the original site of today's Daxin Street Times Newspaper), which later performed at the Great World. The students were named with the character "Fang," such as Zhang Guifang's laosheng (old male role), Huang Yongfang's wusheng (martial male role), and Li Xiangfang's wudan (martial female role), all of whom were talented members of the troupe. Bi Chunfang, the xiaosheng (young male role) currently with the Lin Opera Troupe at the Grand Theater, was also a star of that troupe at the time. Another was the "Little Dong Troupe" at the Small World in the city, whose students were named with the character "Fu," such as Zhou Fushan and Ni Fuchang's laosheng and Chen Fusheng's qingyi (virtuous female role), who were the backbone of the troupe. Unfortunately, these two schools were relatively small, and the managers were not good at running them, especially the latter, which eventually led to their disintegration and disappearance. Establishing an opera school is inherently difficult. Without sustained human and material resources, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. The success of Fuliancheng today is not accidental.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School was established not long ago, and its scale and organization are vastly different from the two aforementioned schools. Its recent performances at the Golden Theater, which ran for four days, were all sold out. The students are named with the character "Zheng." In addition to Peking Opera and Kunqu opera, their daily curriculum includes subjects such as general knowledge, English, arithmetic, society, and Mandarin, making it a well-equipped opera school. The school's drama instructors are mostly renowned figures in the opera world, and the academic instructors are also well-known scholars. Therefore, after opening, it was able to meet drama-loving audiences on the red carpet in the shortest time possible. Wang Zhengkun and Liu Zhengzhong's wusheng and Jing Zhengfei's wenwu chou (civil-military clown role) are the most promising talents. Gu Zhengqiu's shanzi (female role), Guan Zhengming, and Zhou Zhengrong's laosheng are also promising talents if their voices don't change. Moreover, Guan studies the Tan school, and Zhou follows the Liu school. With diligent study, they will undoubtedly stand out. However, the success of a performer cannot rely solely on cultivation and diligence. Stage experience is a crucial factor in success. If there are few opportunities for public performances, the students will gain little stage experience. It is said that the school is considering building its own stage, which would ensure that students can perform regularly without any problems. However, building a stage cannot be done overnight. For the sake of the students' artistic development, it seems impossible to rent from theaters that specialize in long-running and continuous plays. The Golden and New Theaters, which specialize in hiring Peking Opera stars to perform in rotation, may as well make an agreement with them to allow students to perform for a few days in between the departure of the previous batch of stars and the arrival of the next, as was done this time at the Golden Theater. This would both adjust the tastes of the audience and increase the students' stage experience, wouldn't it be a win-win situation? Furthermore, opening up a new venue would allow audiences in the northern district to benefit. I wonder what the school authorities think of this?</p>
<p>The school's public performances have been very well-attended in recent days. Applause and cheers are incessant for every performance. The musicians add embellishments to almost every interlude, making the applause even more enthusiastic. This shows that the instructors have been patiently guiding the students, resulting in this achievement. I believe that the students, who are still young and inexperienced, may misinterpret this external encouragement and become complacent, hindering their artistic progress in terms of the endless pursuit of learning. Therefore, it truly depends on how the instructors use their supervision and encouragement.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Stars' Daily Life</h3>
<p>— Shawi</p>
<p>Cesar Romero, this active man, recently suffered from a seasonal illness, with a fever as high as 106 degrees, forcing him to lie quietly in the hospital for a few weeks. But friends of Romero's fans don't need to worry, because he is said to have recovered.</p>
<p>Hollywood romances are constantly emerging. It is said that Cary Grant and Babbette Hoden are now very close, and the two often appear in public places together. Chester Morris and Lila Bache are also inseparable. As for Norma Shearer and George Raft, and James Stewart and Olivia Havilland, the intensity of these two couples is increasing.</p>
<p>We haven't seen Katharine Hepburn's plays for a long time, but she has recently returned (of course, referring to returning to the film city) and immediately took on the lead role in "The Philadelphia Story", and the director of that film, George Cukor, is also the person she worked with when she first appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Big-eyed star Joan Crawford is now the mother of a child, but the child is not Joan's biological daughter. This lucky girl was originally an orphan. Because Joan's age is increasing year by year, she is very eager for children, so she adopted her as her adopted daughter.</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, Priscilla Lane secretly married Orien Helen, but news came that they recently announced their separation. However, neither of them is willing to announce the reason.</p>
<p>When Jane Wyman learned that she had been assigned the lead role in "Honeymoon for Three", she scratched her head and said: "Well, let me think about it." Because since she married Roland Lee King, everyone has been busy with work and has no opportunity to go on a honeymoon. Now she wants to take this opportunity to have fun, but she is asked to make a play again. So she said that she can only go on a honeymoon after giving birth next January.</p>
<h3>Guohua Starts Filming "Romance of the Western Chamber"</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>The idea of ​​bringing "Romance of the Western Chamber" to the screen was proposed by the owner of Guolian two years ago, and it was internally decided that Chen Yunshang, Hu Die, and others would co-star, and English dialogues would be added, hoping to enter the international market. Today, Guohua has already started filming this film. Zhang Shankun expressed his agreement to avoid fighting each other, which would lead to both sides being hurt. The main characters of Guohua's film are Zhou Xuan (Hongniang), Bai Yun (Zhang Sheng), Zhou Qi (Huiming), Meng Na (Mrs. Cui), Fenghuang (Huanlang), and Tao You (Qintong). As for the role of Cui Yingying, it has been decided to assign a newcomer to play. In order for Zhou Xuan to showcase her singing voice, there are many interludes in the film, including "Breaking off the Engagement," "Interrogation of Hongniang," "Reunion," and "Changting," with lyrics by Fan Yanqiao and music by Yan Hua. It is said that Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, is particularly interested in song and dance films, such as "The Three Smiles" and "Daughter of the Sea," and he still intends to make "Romance of the Western Chamber" into a Chinese-style "Xuan Gong Yan Shi" (palace love history).</p>
<h3>Record of Painting Fans</h3>
<p>— Xie Huifen</p>
<p>Ms. Chen Xiaocui recently donated paintings to the Women's Literary Association. The number of works received is like a mountain, but Ms. Chen has never been willing to do things carelessly. She dedicates herself to painting all day long, but only produces one piece a day. Xiaocui uses her elegant and outstanding brushwork to depict the posture of wind-blown hair and misty temples. Her paintings contain poetry and are naturally elegant. She occasionally imitates the styles of the Song and Yuan dynasties, and her works are charming to the bone. Yesterday, I also obtained a fan painted with bamboo and a lady, with a short poem inscribed on it. The poem, calligraphy, and painting are all excellent and worth cherishing. It is said that the original limit for donated paintings was fifty pieces, which has now been met, and no more submissions will be accepted. However, Ms. Chen is very interested in painting fans and plans to continue painting one fan a day as a pastime in her boudoir. The remuneration for each fan is ten yuan for a meticulous lady figure and six yuan for an ordinary figure. White fan surfaces are provided as gifts. Those who want to order do not need to send the fan to be painted. The receiving address is still No. 14 Love Ma Yuxian Road. I am also a member of the Women's Literary Association and admire Ms. Chen very much, so I am happy to write about it.</p>

<p>I recently received a letter from Mr. Xue Weihan, stating that the "Hook Heart Fight Angle" game has received enthusiastic responses, but no one has guessed it yet. Therefore, in response to the requests of enthusiasts, the disclosure will be postponed for one week. (Editor)</p>
