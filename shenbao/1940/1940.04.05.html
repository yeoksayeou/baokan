<h3 id="c12">英日豈有和諧之望 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>英國國會上下兩院於隔昨開會時，又以英國之遠東政策爲議論中心。蓋遠東問題旣爲舉世關切之問題，而駐在日本之英國大使克萊琪爵士日前在東京演說英日國交，所以表示英國態度者，辭多模稜噯味：消息遠播，予聞者以極惡劣之印象，英美輿論爲之譁然；英國議員爰以會議之機會，向政府當局追求其究竟。問答之辭，具如本報今日所刊倫敦電訉；其間有足說叫隔昨議論之重要性者，蓋有一問一答：議員諾爾巴克氏問一日本方面倘若發生一種印象以爲英國人民雖在歐洲抵抗侵略，但將在亞洲寬恕侵略；印象而若此，豈非不幸？」外務次官白特勒氏答以一余期望日本方面未有此種印象，余尤所欣慰者，余此次答覆之措辭，定能消滅此種印象」云。白特勒氏之說，雖非最正式之外交宣言，然足以使模稜噯昧之辭，歸於明朗者也。</p>
<p>鑒於英國國會中之質問紛紛，知克萊琪大使之所演說，實有召致憂疑之因素；由此而聯想及於去夏美國駐日大使格魯氏之演說，婉轉而透澈，溫厚而堅定；謂使節才調之殊歟？謂政策剛柔之殊歟？相提並論，爲之低徊不置矣。鑒於議員質詢之辭，知英國人士能注意於其當局之如何援助中國。如何尊重九國公約，如何痛惡侵略，如何惟恐當局對侵略之寬容與承認，以及體認日本侵略行爲乃舉世所一致譴責。鑒於央國外務次官白特勒氏之答復下議員者，曁外務大臣哈立法克斯氏之答復上議員者，知英國遠東政策確能不因國際之變態而變更，不因環境之惡劣而惡化。如謂：英國政府繼續承認重慶國民政府爲中國合法政府；又謂，英國始終勉力依據九公約所有之原則，行使其遠東政策：又謂，英國與美法政府保持一致步驟：凡此數端，可信爲安定遠東之重要因素也。三年以來，英國當局關於遠東各種問題之言與行，可使中國與中國之友人感覺憂疑憤懣，甚至有引起感情上反決之可能者，不乏其例；然大多仍能抑制感情，消弭反應，竭力維持辛酸之友愛於不敝者，英國猶能把握此項安定遠東之重要因素實爲之基礎也。</p>
<p>就英國國會隔昨議論之中，猶得證實英國朝野對於日本，有一意念焉，，即甚望英日兩國國交與國策之和諧，此實英國所憧憬而煩悶。日本方面亦有此同一之意念，其憧憬煩悶且尤過之。兩國俱深徬徨，蓋不可掩。憶中國故小說家言：男女愛慕，最易和諧，其事僅關仙我二人，我旣千願萬願，便佔一半道理，何况我願他願。以此擬之國際之相追求，頗相類似，而英日則不然。何也？國交非無苟合之事例，祇以國策牴牾，遂致苟合而不可得，就日本方面言之：在彼發動對華武力侵略之始，不但鄙薄英國如無物，彼急功好利，志切獨吞者，且以擯除英國出遠東爲快意，彼仰慕德國者且以促使英國於崩潰爲快意；及至武力侵略久而無功，不自咎其不度德不量力，獨遷怒於英國，遂嘗試其壓迫英國；及至壓迫無宏效，而猶視英國爲彼侵略之梗，遂輒示其亟願修好之私；跡象斑斑，皆可覆按，然獨吞之策略如故也，試壓迫，謀修好，無非爲獨呑之旁敲側擊而已，就英國方面言之：以德國爲唯一敵國，以戰勝德國爲唯一目標，旣不欲在德國之外，更行樹敵，尤懼他國之祖德以爲已敵；於此時會，日本方謀有所挾持，於是英國不得已而輒與周旋；跡象斑斑，亦可覆按，即如克萊琪大使小辭阿諛之卑，縱惡之嫌，發爲模稜噯昧之談者，雖視爲虛相委蛇之一貌可也。然英國在遠東有其不容對日屈辱退讓者在焉：廣大之權益所關，一也；條約上之神聖義務所限，二也；對德作戰所號召於彼國內外之同一論據所在，三也；控制其屬國風地之威望所繫，四也；不與美國國策相悖以保持美國同情，五也；對日和諧則必須屈辱退讓，對日屈辱退讓則無異於將此五者一舉而犧牲之，此五者又英國維持其爲帝國之重要條件也。質言之，芙國對日本屈辱讓步之後果，實與對德戰敗相等耳，謂英國堪乎？惟英日現實之相牴牾若此，何望於相和諧？</p>

<h3 id="c68">迂迥三千里　從西安到上海 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 海萍</p>
<p>滇陝鐵路將次完成　潼關寗靜洛陽繁榮</p>
<p>由於職務，兩年來曾經跋涉了數萬里，从華南到華北，由西南到西北，沒有一刻不在興奮中渡過的。這次，由西安來到上海，途中給我多少材料，或者還是大家都要知道的事，現在簡單地寫述在下邊。</p>
<p>別矣西安</p>
<p>從離開西安到現在巳經是一個多月了，一個多月以前的西安和現在的西安，也許沒有多大的分別。在我離開的時候，正是廢曆的新年，有些地方是被白雪遮蓋住了，戰事方面只有綏西方面華軍挺進五原，除了綏西以外，在西北可以說都是沉寂的。其次談到西北的建設，說到建設在西北可不及西南，雖然西北不及西南，可是各項的建設都不遺餘力的，上了隴海鐵路的火車，想起戰前的時候，山西安到上海，經隴海鐵路至徐州換車，最多不消三天就可以直達上海。現在呢。當然沒有以前那樣的方便，隴海鐵路的本身，已經有了很大的辯遷，從東海連雲港起直達西女的鐵道已經成了數段，由連雲港到徐州的這一段，在徐州會戰的時候破壞了，山徐州向西至開封的一段，現在淪陷了，從開封到鄭州這一段已經破壞了，由鄭州到洛陽這一段我方為了向西延長的關係，已經拆掉了，現在的隴海鐵路，可以說是只有洛陽到寶鷄的一段。其中達關的一段，由於隣近風陵渡的關係，時常遭受砲的射擊，所以火車不能直接通過，來往的客貨，是要步行八十華里的路程。</p>
<p>關於鐵路的消息，在後方是不大公開的。可是大家都非常注意到它，由昆明到西安這條溝通西南西北主要的幹道，是規定年限完成的，凡是經過道條路上的人終可以看到成萬的人在不住的動着工。不久以前，也可以說是兩個月前，我參加過一條新落成的鐵路通車典禮，副局長及總工程師很興奮的和我們談到鐵路的情形，說他們正以最大的努力來完成他們的任務。</p>
<p>到了潼關</p>
<p>隴海鐵路的火車，年來可以說不斷的乘坐。去年的三四月還可以山洛陽直達西安，五月以後就不能通行，當時日軍由中條山攻入茅津渡，砲擊靈寶的鐵橋，自此隴海路因而中斷，可是現在對於還個問題，巳經有了相當解決的辦法，在某次通車典禮的時侯，副局長說三個月後即可根本解決。</p>
<p>我這次經過潼關的時候，和以前的情形相同，前綫上是寗靜的。潼關與風陵僅一河之隔，雙方互相對守着，連槍聲也沒有。潼關的城樓還是巍峨的矗立着，傍山近水，不减歷史上的威風。</p>
<p>路過洛陽</p>
<p>戰時的洛陽，雖然在日機的轟炸之下並沒有减少它的繁榮。過去的洛陽僅达是普通的　業區，而現在制估有軍事與政洽的地位，它的繁榮比　過去有過之而無不及。在我們每次山前方　來，　能那得到滿意的安慰。在這裏的，那遍是軍民，都是在緊張中生活，已經鍛鍊出偉大的氣魄。軍隊與老白姓那是和靄可親的。</p>
<p>我離開洛陽的時候，正是廢歷的上元節，每家的門。都是掛着紅燈，張燈結彩的玩着花燎，街市上熱鬧的情形，可以說從來沒有，為什麼會有這樣熱鬧，這分明是大家對戰事有絕對的信念。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c69">科學考察團返渝後　舉行西康文物展覽　大量木材外運困難　邊疆教育頗見進步 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>重慶航訊、中華自然科學社所組織之西康科學者察團、一行二十餘人、分為地理氣象。農林。畜牧藥物。工程四組、入康考察、費時三月、遍歷西康各重要區域、搜集樣本極多、三月上六日起該社聯合邊疆問　研究會、在青年會舉行公開展覽三日、陳列樣本共計六百餘件、或係著名土產、或係珍貴文物、均富有價值、同持該團並茶話招待新聞界、報告考察經過、據地理氣象組長朱曉賓報告、</p>
<p>遍地森林</p>
<p>西康地勢極高、約海拔三千餘公呎、其最高之貢噶峯童達七千餘公呎、故氣候極寒、夏季最高溫度僅攝氏喪十四度因此種植農作物極不適宜、全區僅產青稞大麥兩種、其他農作物殊不見多、惟森林一項、幾於遍處皆有，而其可用之木材、通常均有兩三抱大、二三丈高、惜交通困難、無法外運、以致貨棄於地、無人開發、有時且被土人認為妨害農產種植、大量予以砍伐或燒燬、殊覺可惜、</p>
<p>採金不易</p>
<p>藥物一項雖產量甚豐、但採藥者只知取用、不知培植、今後應以只知取用、不知培植、今後應以人為力量、加緊培植菱物產量、庶取之不窮、用之不竭、談到一般社會情形、殊非一言可盡、康人十分之九、崇信佛教、且家有子弟均以作喇嘛為榮、故全康男子有三分之一是喇嘛、過去一般人均認西康遍地皆是黃金、此次經本團入康考察結果、認為此說應加修正、西康現在雖有掘金者三＋餘起、但均係沙金、往往用力多而收效少、所謂遍地皆黃金者、實非親自經歷之談、西康人力缺乏、不僅智識份子、即一船苦力、均由四川前往、故本人考察西康歸來、對於開發該地之意見、認為第一應開闢交通、使內外物產、能互相暢流、第二應加緊教育、使當地人民能直接注意生產、劉於外去工作者、尤應特注意其人格修養、庶幾不致發生隔聞云、</p>
<p>展覽會中</p>
<p>在展覽訪中、首先令我們感到的、是西康物產蘊藏的富饒、一幅礦產分布圖上·煤·鉛·鋁·硝·鋅·石油金各種的代表符號稠密的布滿全紙、產量固未標明、但從類別之多一點來看、已足够驚人了、據考察團總幹事朱炳海氏語記者、西康的物產、除礦產外、以藥物森林為最著、有數人合抱不過來的大樹、有走了幾天幾夜還走不完的大森林、最引為缺憾者、以是耕地較為稀少而已、這裏展覽着的康人、日常用具二分之一以上是鋼製的、還有毛織品也是目前一般人認為奇貴所不敢領敎的、然而陳列着康人衣着、不但全覇毛織、甚至速裝食鹽的袋子地是毛織品、這些我們餘　罪於物產運銷未能調整外、而我們所感到的、仍然是物產的富饒、尚有待於開發、此外濃厚的宗教氣氛也是充滿於會塲的、我們看到很多繪畫得很精細的佛像、以及各種見所未見的法器，關於這朱炳海氏約略談到一些、「一般人總以為開發邊疆的困難問題、是民族問題的如何崩決、但據我們數月工作的經騐、則認為西康的藏人本質樸直、祗要待之以誠、無事不能迎刃而解」、</p>
<p>教育進步</p>
<p>瀏覽到「文教類」、這裏有西康小學教材編　委員會編撰的小學用書、一面藏文、一面國語、這兩文字對照着的課本、我們總不得不承認是開發邊疆的文化的利器、而且這裏的確已有了成績的表現、一本藏族兒童古文光的日記、一篇康定藏族女子學校三年級學生十一歲幼童吳委蘭的作文、漢文居然寫的非常通順、也許有人會以為這是奇蹟、但在這課本與作業的兩種情形並列之下、無疑地通告拆了我們乃是敎育工具運用的成功、會塲的四壁遍懸關於西康之照片、舉凡森林，禽獸。風　。民俗。房屋。　慄。以及　察團在旅途之情形、均包罷無遺、吸引了不少的人們、逐幅細間、幾種珍貴的獸類標本、如金絲猴皮　牛尾等、更　起人們無上的興趣。（卓韋寄）</p>

<p>英美僑協會昨晚均對如何爭取其他國籍納稅人投票擁護一事、作長時間之討論、美僑協會所議決者、則爲所有美僑、應一致投票擁護芙僑候選人五人、及美僑候選二人、對日僑候選人及雷諾麥唐納氏、完全置之勿顧、對麥唐納氏、美人本無任何惡感、但因渠或將影響美僑在工部局中獲得二席一事關重大、故不得不如此耳、美僑協會昨日並議決推選爵德氏爲主席、而於十日及十一日兩日、收集所有美僑之選舉票、渠對記者稱、渠希望英美僑民能在最近之將來、採完全一致行動、而參加此次競選、</p>
<p>美僑婦女一致參加</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國婦女總會會員及其他美僑婦女、定於五日上午十一時、在靜安寺路五七七號會所舉行會議、討論公共租界工部局董事選舉事宜、聞該會會員及其他美僑婦女寄居公寓　他種房屋者、均有投票權、惟不知之、且未向工部局登記、故明日集會時、將報吿取獲選舉權及投票手續、俾美僑婦女一致參加投票、</p>
<p>美僑反對展期投票</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、報載本市主要美商擬主張展期舉行工部局董事選舉、記者頃以此詢諸美僑聯合會會長費斯特、據答稱、要求領事團延緩選舉之議、不切實用、本人聞人提及此種計劃後、即與多數美僑接觸、彼等咸謂此乃失敗主義者之觀念、已一致表示反對、美僑聯合會委員會決不討論此項計劃、又領事團亦未聞有人要求展期選舉之事、至令晨報載此訊始知之、</p>
<p>有人建議選舉延期</p>
<p>大陸報云、上海美僑方面重要納稅人、昨夜討論本屆工部局董事選舉展期舉行之可能性、因本市現狀、已失常態、工部局旣不能完全管理整個公共租界、尤其是北區東區、大戰之後、當地各種情况、又極紊亂、認爲有充分理由、可申請上海領事團將預定本月十日及十一日選舉日期予以展緩、</p>
<p>英美合作可獲勝利</p>
<p>英美僑民對於此次選舉結果、頗多揣測、且仍有人以爲日方在競選中、未必獲勝、據負責英美人士聲稱、此將視各國僑民能吾組織聯合陣綫而定、</p>
<p>最後結果未可預測</p>
<p>本市日人約可投三千七百票、其他各國納稅人可投五千餘票少數僑民中、則德僑連同德奧難民在內的可投六百票、其中四百票屬猶太難民、彼等多半僑居蘇州河北岸、日方刻正竭力向之游說、但其他各國納稅人苟其全體選舉本國籍候選人、對日方應有之兩候選人、亦不投一票、則日方即使獲得猶太人投票權之什七、及一部份或全部德僑之投票權、亦未必獲勝、</p>
<p>德國僑民態度一斑</p>
<p>德僑在滬人數約有一千六七百人、其有資格之選舉人、佔有若干、亦爲此次工部局競選中有重要關係、據平明社記者訪諸德使館方面消息、此次工部局董事競選潮中、德國官方並無若何意見、另有團體從事於選舉事宜、據悉、有資格之德僑投票人的共七百餘人、彼輩因受歐洲局勢之影響、或有投票贊助日董之勢、否則亦將投票贊助美僑、　拎此點、尙在不可知之數</p>
<p>猶人表示保守中立</p>
<p>日方以選舉日期已迫企圖誘致是他國納稅人、予以援助、惟據上海歐洲難民救濟委員會及國際難民救濟會方面消息、猶太難民在此次選舉中所應採取之態度、已由哥摩氏發表聲明、據謂渠曾向日人保證、渠決不阻礙猶人在此次選舉中保守中立或投票贊成日人之舉動、哥摩氏以爲此乃屬於一種自然現象、猶太難民對於此事、自身旣無代表揮足工部局、自應保守其中立態度、而就各個人之自由意志、投票贊助其所愛戴之人物、彼等絕對不應受團體行爲之束縛、</p>

<p>兒童讀物</p>
<h3 id="c123">一個建議 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>導鴻君懇切的「希望上海的著作界出版界把一部份眼光移到兒童讀物上面，替我們苦難的孩子造一點福。」我除了贊成和響應外，再加上一點「貢獻」。</p>
<p>兒童讀物是最重要的敎具，是運行學習材料的匯集所，是家庭間用以訓練兒童求學的一種工具。但是讀物材料的價値，不在使兒童僅僅記憶牠的內容；是在牠能漸移默化帮助兒童擴展思想組織思想改造思想使兒童能由牠而變化其實際行為，以適應社會生活的環境。</p>
<p>小課程標準第一節「小學敎育總目標」裏說：「小學敎育應根據三民主義，遵照中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針，發展兒童身心，培養國民道德及生活所必需的基本知識和技能，以養成知禮知義愛國愛羣的國民。」所以兒童讀物應該要：</p>
<p>培育兒童健康的秒表</p>
<p>陶冶兒童良好的品性</p>
<p>發展兒童愛美的興趣</p>
<p>增進兒童生活的知能</p>
<p>訓練兒童勞動的習慣</p>
<p>培養兒童愛國愛羣觀念</p>
<p>養成兒童互助團結的精神</p>
<p>小學的兒童讀物大槪分為二大類，一類是課內的，一類是課外的。小學生對於課內的讀物，不過敎科用書，姑不具論，現在談談課外讀物：</p>
<p>（甲）讀物內容的標準：</p>
<p>（一）是兒童現實生活所必需</p>
<p>（二）是現代社會生活所必需</p>
<p>（三）要能發展兒童思想的。</p>
<p>（四）要能引起兒童創造力的</p>
<p>（五）要能增加兒童的研究興趣的。</p>
<p>（六）要使兒童能領會的，能享樂的。</p>
<p>（七）要以兒童生活範圍內的經騐和環境做根據的。</p>
<p>（八）要適合兒童心理，及生理的發展程序的。</p>
<p>（九）要有改造的功用，可以增進兒童適應生活的能力的。</p>
<p>（十）要生動的，有趣味的不違反自然現象的。</p>
<p>（十一）要能指示進化的趨勢鼓舞兒童奮發的。</p>
<p>（十二）要有伸縮的餘地，使能適應個性的需要。</p>
<p>（乙）讀物材料排列的方式：</p>
<p>（一）多用心理的排列—根據兒童的心理去求滿足其需要的排列法。</p>
<p>（二）從具體的到抽象的—因為具體的材料比抽象的容易明白。</p>
<p>（三）從舊經騐到新知識—根據兒童生活範圍內的經騐為原則，使兒童學習的興趣濃厚而得至反應。</p>
<p>（丙）用字問題：</p>
<p>（一）要日常生活最多用的。</p>
<p>（二）要多用熟字，新字（生字）反覆的次數須多。</p>
<p>（丁）讀物材料的形式：</p>
<p>（一）印刷要清楚。</p>
<p>（二）紙張要潔白。</p>
<p>（三）字體要大，每列每行的字，不可過多。</p>
<p>（四）字和字，行和行間，要有適當的距離。</p>
<p>（五）插圖要多，物像要畫得確切。</p>
<p>（六）標點要明。</p>
<p>（七）裝訂要牢，要美觀；封面的佈軒更要有生動和象徵內容的技巧。</p>
<p>以上是未來的希望，而要請負這項責任的人來改進的！</p>
<h3 id="c124">仍須努力 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 公懐</p>
<p>在四月一日的春秋欄內，讀到導鴻君的「我們的兒童讀物呢」一文，語重心長，不勝欽佩。筆者亦深感得目前上海的兒童讀物的確太少了，不够兒童精神上的營養。但兒童讀物恐慌的程度，却尚不至於到「目前不但沒有一本眞正的兒童讀物，連提倡的人也沒有了」的地步。現在我來就我所知道優良兒童讀物及兒童讀物的出版消息，向讀者報導一下</p>
<p>關於兒童閱讀的定期刋物，戰前的確很多，而且多數是各大書坊出版的，戰後這些刋物，相繼停刋，曾有一個沉寂提時期。但後來，上海兒童，新兒童，小主人，中國兒童，少年時事讀本等期刋，陸續刋行，共有十餘種，不過多數是由幾個人的力量創辦的，人力財力均感不足，但在此時此地，也不容易了。並且，那時各大報上，像申報，新聞報，新聞夜報，文匯報，大晚報，中美日報等，也都有兒童週刋。迨至歐戰爆發，外匯奇縮，紙價飛漲，於是為了經濟力的薄弱，期刋紛紛停刋，報紙上的兒童附刋，也有緊縮篇幅，甚至化為烏有，這不能不說是鵝絨讀物的絕大困厄，到現在，期刋中只有新兒童和小主人，照常出版，仍保持着固有的作風和態度，其他則完全消滅。聽說：最近時代出版社將有童年月刋出版，不久即可和讀者相日滿期以。這幾種刋物，立塲純正，內容也還精彩，是値得介紹給孤島兒童一讀的。至於報紙上的兒童附刋，除申報，新聞報，大晚報外，其他都已停刋</p>
<p>至於單行本，現在，少年出版社和時代出版社，非常努力。少年出版社已出版的，有新西南遊記，小三子，小夏伯陽等十多種，頗有時代性。時代出版社出版的小癩痢，野小鬼等十餘種。內容非常精彩。在計劃出版或印刷中的，少年有新歌曲，報童生活及抗戰小故事等多種；時代有兒童戲劇，故事，小說等多數。其他，尚有新兒童社出版的新兒童小叢書，及木蘭從軍（兒童劇）等。這幾個出版社，都是熱心提倡兒童讀物的人所主持的，他們在艱苦的物質條件下。努力產生着優良的讀物，這種精神，我們是不能一筆抹煞的。</p>
<p>雖然，以孤島兒童數量的鉅大，僅僅這一點讀物，是不够的。但也許，有很多兒童，連這一點讀物，還沒人介紹給他們哩。我希望在「救救兒童」的口號下，出版商，小出版社，作者，能共同努力！</p>
<h3 id="c125">割股之心 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 不仁</p>
<p>「窮人無病便是福」這眞是一句至理名言，尤其是在這大都巿中，不但窮人不能生病，即是中產階級也沒有生病的資格：如果更不幸而生「富貴病」，那祗有坐以待斃了。所以當有許多醫師提議拒收藥方佣金的時候，我們曾希望在拒收不合理的佣金之外，最好在可能範圍內减低合理的診金，更其是出診的診金。</p>
<p>至於醫院，在病人送院之初，必須先納住院費若干；如遇動手術的病症，則又須手術費付足後，才肯施行手術。這或許是格於醫院定章，但是法律有時也因人情而轉移，醫師以造福人羣為職志，如果病家因籌款而延誤時間，豈不就是延誤了病人的生命？如昨報所載，「寶隆醫院外科主任被控過失罪」一案，就為了出外籌足十元打針費，以致「相隔時間甚久，流血過多，竟告不救而死。」</p>
<p>過失罪，自然也不能確定。不過由於這案糾的發生，如遇急症等情，我們還是籲請不必格於定章，和做賣買一樣「銀物兩交。」諺云：醫師有割股之心，站在一個行臨斷絕呼吸的不幸者前面，即使不談「職志」，在人類同情心的基點上，也應該惻隱之心油然而生吧？</p>
<h3 id="c126">雨過天青 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來，崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>吳君素道：「這也是人性之所近，像她是位好動不好靜的人，要敎他乖乖兒的坐在那兒看一點鐘的書，只怕也坐不住了。所以她東翻西搜，只挑她喜歡瞧的雜誌看了。」瞿無變道：「但是我們總佩服慧華姊的絕頂聰明。無論什麽事，只要他一看，全都明白。她倘然要學會這一件事，他是拚着精力，非學會了不可，她眞是一位有天才而又肯努力的人。」邵慧華道：「好了！好了！別罵人啦。」她們漸漸走到瞿無變辦事的一個屋子前來了，瞿無變便邀請胃她們進去坐一會。原來瞿無變辦的是報上一個附刋，喚做「婦女園地」，轉載婦女的事。近來男女一切平權，求學就職也和男子一律平等，似乎不必特就婦女界另列一欄了。但是中國婦女，受數千年來的束縛，到近年來始得解放。在各處開通的地方，上流階級的婦女，力求前進的固然不少。若是在內地或是農村之間，婦女知識，還覺得很淺。因為婦女占全國人口之半，倘然婦女知識淺陋，便是一國文化低落。所以復興的中國，對於婦女的敎育，加倍的提倡，婦女的知識，極力的啟發。大家以為「婦女園地」，另闢一欄，還是要的。現在請了瞿無雙小姐編這「婦女園地」一欄，婦女界很歡迎此欄。况且近年婦女界讀報的逐漸增多，也覺得報紙是人生電影院什麽電影，京劇塲什麽京劇而已。瞿無雙除在報傷，每天編婦女園地一欄以外，還編一種雜誌，叫做「婦女知識」。那是半月刋，每個月出兩期，也是這個報官裏出版的，每期可銷二十五萬份左右。因此瞿無雙對於編輯上的事，倒也很忙的了。她們踏進了瞿無雙的編輯室，覺得那屋子雖然不大，收拾得很為精潔。屋子中也有幾架書櫉，兩張寫字桌，對面安放。却是除丁瞿無雙外，還有一位助手。此刻位子空了，她已經回去了。瞿無雙招呼這幾位小姊妹道：「請坐！請坐！只是這屋子太窄了，眞是地小不足以迴旋。我這裏無物可以奉敬，還有一些綠茶，是人家送給我的，泡來請諸君各飲一杯。」　（二五九）</p>
<h3 id="c127">隔絕失望之屏障 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— M．Chin．　156</p>
<p>倫敦方面傅出消息，英國工程師發明一種方法，能阻敵軍之進攻。此項發明似曾秘密表演，當時英國國防部長殷斯基潑爵士亦在座參觀。此項發明不　一種屏障，使受攻擊者與死亡相隔絕。雖其詳情無從得知，然此項驚人之消息必已為各國軍事領袖所深切注意矣。</p>
<p>今日　世間有一般人運用智力及利用科學，發明種種殺人之利器，務使敵已者早就死地以為快，同時亦有一般人抱絕大之犧牲精神，潛心研究，發明方法，抵抗及撲滅危害人命之物　，此等發明亦為隔絕死亡之屏障，然此種屏障不樹於人與人之間，而樹於人與害物之間。試舉一例，莫如撲滅瘧疾一事。瘧疾為流行最烈火之疾病之一，每年患者達八萬萬人。世界各國醫師與科學家努力研究，發明方法，使人類不受瘧疾寄生蟲之危害。</p>

<p>小朋友們！我曉得你們歡喜聽故事，現在先講故事給你們聽吧：從前德國有一位老敎員他每逢遇日滿期以小學生就脫帽行禮很是恭敬。別人看見，甚為詫異，問他在小孩子面前，何必這樣謙恭客氣呢？他回答道，「小孩子前途無限，他們將來，或者要做大事，成偉人，不可不尊敬他們。」後來那老敎員的小學生當中，果然出了一位偉人，就是路得瑪丁，提倡宗敎革命，創立福音敎會的，就是他。我現在也是本则会這樣的思想，向你們小朋友，說明我尊敬你們的意想對於你們的前途，抱着極大的希望，要你們自尊自重，不做卑鄙睛流的人。我打一個謎你們猜：「金古董，銀古董，打得開關不攏」想必你們都要喊着說：「我猜着了！是雞蛋」不錯，是雞蛋，也可以說是你們小朋友。讓我解釋。因為都包在那小雞蛋之內，都要從那小蛋裏出來。什麽英雄偉人，大政治家，大宗敎家，大科學家，大文學家，都是從小學生做起。光陰過得很快，再過十年，二十年，你們這些小朋友小孩子，都是要長大成人，在這裏有個最要緊的問題，是你們將來成個什麽人？英雄偉人，固然是小學生出身，上面已經說過但土匪强盜還不是做過小孩子的麽？請問你將來成個什麽人？（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c129">值得研究的事　嘉寶何以不得金像獎 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 妲妮</p>
<p>十幾年來全球最享盛名的影星莫過於葛烈達嘉寶了。的確，她那「神秘女郎」的金招牌，還有誰不知道哩！她的獨特作風，更奠定了她超卓的地位</p>
<p>然而好萊塢却以為嘉寶不會做戲，因為：她從未獲得「演技最優」的金像獎！</p>
<p>在她未享名之前，獲獎的明星有曼麗璧克馥；當她全盛之時，又給凱蒂玲赫本和瑙瑪希拉佔去鰲頭；她後輩如露薏絲雷娜等，也超越她的前頭而得輝煌的金像了。</p>
<p>這是因為嘉寶不為做戲呢，還是好萊塢的觀眾沒有眼光：其實都不是的，聽我說下去：</p>
<p>嘉寶演戲的時候，完全不像在做戲，更不肯「賣氣力」，她的表情是簡潔而直截了當，不尚苛細的。因此，有些不能領會的便以為這是她的缺憾，殊不知，這恰是她的過人之處</p>
<p>那些「一度」得過獎的明星，其中有許多在今日已經給人遺忘了。可是，嘉寶印象卻永遠留在人們的記憶之中。這就是她的「偉大」所在，我們不妨這樣說：得不得金像獎並不是嘉寶的失敗，相反地正是她的成功。因為她的成功不是「一次」「兩次」，而是「永遠」的！</p>

<h3 id="e12">Is Harmony Possible Between Britain and Japan? <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>When the British Parliament's upper and lower houses convened the day before yesterday, the focus of discussion was once again Britain's Far East policy. As the Far East issue is a matter of global concern, and as Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, recently delivered a speech in Tokyo on British-Japanese relations, his expression of Britain's attitude was largely ambiguous and equivocal. The news spread far and wide, giving listeners an extremely negative impression. British and American public opinion were in an uproar, so British parliamentarians seized the opportunity of the meeting to question the government authorities to get to the bottom of the matter. The questions and answers were as described in the London dispatch published in this newspaper today. Among them, there is something worth saying about the importance of the day-before-yesterday's discussion, namely, there was a question and answer: MP Mr. Noel-Baker asked, "If the Japanese side were to have the impression that the British people, while resisting aggression in Europe, would tolerate aggression in Asia; if such an impression were to arise, would it not be unfortunate?" Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler replied, "I hope that the Japanese side does not have this impression. I am especially pleased that the wording of my reply will certainly eliminate this impression." Although Mr. Butler's statement is not the most formal diplomatic declaration, it is sufficient to clarify the ambiguous and equivocal words.</p>
<p>In view of the numerous questions in the British Parliament, it is known that Ambassador Craigie's speech did indeed have elements that caused concern and suspicion. From this, we can think of the speech given by the American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, last summer, which was tactful and thorough, gentle and firm. Should we say that there is a difference in the talents of the envoys? Should we say that there is a difference in the rigidity and flexibility of the policies? Comparing them together, we cannot help but hesitate. In view of the parliamentarians' questions, we know that the British people can pay attention to how their authorities will help China, how they will respect the Nine-Power Treaty, how they will abhor aggression, how they fear that the authorities will tolerate and recognize aggression, and how they recognize that Japan's aggressive behavior is universally condemned. In view of the replies of Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler to the members of the Lower House, and of Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax to the members of the Upper House, it is known that Britain's Far East policy can indeed not be changed due to international changes, and will not deteriorate due to the deterioration of the environment. For example, it is said that the British government continues to recognize the Chongqing National Government as the legitimate government of China; it is also said that Britain has always striven to implement its Far East policy based on all the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty; it is also said that Britain maintains a consistent approach with the US and French governments: all these points can be believed to be important factors in stabilizing the Far East. In the three years since then, there have been many instances in which the words and actions of the British authorities regarding various Far East issues have caused the Chinese and China's friends to feel worried, angry, and even to have the potential to provoke an emotional backlash. However, most people are still able to restrain their emotions, eliminate the reaction, and strive to maintain the painstaking friendship without decay. The fact that Britain is still able to grasp this important factor in stabilizing the Far East is the foundation for it.</p>
<p>From the British Parliament's discussion the day before yesterday, it can still be confirmed that the British government and public have one idea regarding Japan, that is, they very much hope for harmony between the British and Japanese national relations and national policies. This is what Britain longs for and is troubled by. The Japanese side also has the same idea, and their longing and frustration are even greater. Both countries are deeply at a loss, which cannot be concealed. Recall the words of ancient Chinese novelists: love between men and women is easiest to harmonize, because the matter only concerns the two of us, and if I am willing a thousand times, then I account for half the reason, let alone if he is also willing. This is quite similar to the mutual pursuit of nations, but it is not the case with Britain and Japan. Why is that? It is not that there are no examples of hasty compromise between nations, but because national policies conflict, it is impossible to achieve even a hasty compromise. From the Japanese side's point of view: at the beginning of its launch of armed aggression against China, it not only despised Britain as if it were nothing, but because it was eager for quick success and profit, and was determined to swallow everything up, it was pleased to exclude Britain from the Far East. Those who admired Germany were even pleased to cause Britain to collapse. Now that armed aggression has been going on for a long time without success, instead of blaming itself for not knowing its limits, it blames Britain alone, and then tries to oppress Britain. And when oppression has no great effect, and still sees Britain as a barrier to its aggression, it shows its eagerness to make peace. The evidence is clear, and can all be reviewed. However, the strategy of monopolizing everything remains the same. Trying to oppress and plotting to make peace are nothing more than indirect attacks to achieve monopoly. From the British side's point of view: it regards Germany as its only enemy, and regards defeating Germany as its only goal. It does not want to create more enemies outside of Germany, and is especially afraid that other countries will unite against it as its enemy. At this time, Japan is plotting to hold it hostage, so Britain has no choice but to deal with it. The evidence is clear, and can all be reviewed. For example, Ambassador Craigie's humble words of flattery, and suspicion of indulging evil, expressed in ambiguous and equivocal words, can be regarded as a mere appearance of acting with insincerity. However, Britain has its own interests in the Far East that do not allow it to be humiliated and retreat by Japan: the extensive interests at stake are one thing; the sacred obligations under the treaty are a limit, two; the same arguments that are invoked at home and abroad for the war against Germany, three; the prestige of controlling its affiliated countries and territories is at stake, four; and not contradicting US policy in order to maintain US sympathy, five. To harmonize with Japan, it must be humiliated and retreat. To be humiliated and retreat by Japan is tantamount to sacrificing all five of these things at once. These five things are also important conditions for Britain to maintain its status as an empire. In short, the consequences of Britain's humiliation and concession to Japan are actually equal to defeat by Germany. Can Britain bear it? Because the conflict between Britain and Japan is so great, how can harmony be hoped for?</p>

At the same time, the central troops and the communist troops in various places have ended their conflict operations and are waiting for the resolution of the senior authorities of the two parties. According to sources with reliable information who spoke to the Reuters reporter, the Japanese are provoking conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, hoping to make Chongqing embarrassed. If the Japanese succeed in their plan, it will become a great joke that is rarely seen in the history of the world, because the Japanese claim to be carrying out military operations in China in order to eliminate the communist forces, but the new policy of the Japanese will make the communist threat a reality. Before the Xi'an Incident, the communist troops had been reduced to less than 20,000 people, occupying a small area in northern Shaanxi and the northeastern end of Gansu, but since the outbreak of the war, the strength of the communist troops has increased sharply, leading to misunderstandings and rumors that the communist troops are preserving their strength and not participating in large-scale anti-Japanese military operations, but only seeking to occupy new areas and recruit new troops. Some even say that the communist troops are not fighting against the Japanese, but are gradually taking over areas that were formerly under the jurisdiction of the central government. Chongqing also admits that there are frictions and misunderstandings between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but the leaders of both parties understand that what the Japanese hope for is the split between the two parties.

<p>Wuyuan. The Chinese army in western Sui took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, and has now completed the encirclement of the Japanese troops gathered near Anbei, and is about to launch a fierce attack. The Chinese army, which advanced to the outskirts of Baotou in separate columns, has also reached its intended locations. The main force of the Japanese army has been annihilated, and the rear is empty. The Chinese army has not encountered Japanese resistance during its advance, and the progress is extremely rapid. (Dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. A spokesman for the Chinese army said at the weekly press conference this afternoon that the Japanese army's counteroffensive in western Sui has been repulsed. The Chinese army is now encircling Anbei, northeast of Wuyuan. Since the Japanese army re-entered the city of Wuyuan on the evening of March 27, fierce fighting has occurred. One battalion commander of the Chinese army was killed in action. The Chinese army threatened the Japanese army's rear, forcing them to retreat in two directions on March 30. One was the main force of the Japanese army, which moved southeast towards Baotou, and the other retreated northeast towards Anbei. The Chinese army, concentrated in the Wula Mountains west of Baotou, intercepted the main force of the Japanese army near Xishanzui. After a fierce battle, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and turned to Anbei, joining forces with another retreating Japanese army. The Chinese army is now attacking Anbei, and it is highly possible that it will recapture the area soon. Anbei has been occupied for more than two years. The spokesman stressed that the Wuyuan battle has revealed that the Japanese army is weakening in both offensive and defensive aspects. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. People in China here are overjoyed to receive the latest military news from the front lines of western Sui. According to the news, the Japanese army's counteroffensive in western Sui has been repulsed, and the Chinese army now completely controls western Sui, as far west as the Wula Mountains, and is advancing east towards Baotou. After the Chinese army captured Wuyuan, the Japanese army transferred a strong force from Baotou to attack west, determined to invade Wuyuan again. On the 25th and 26th of last month, the two armies fought a bloody battle on both sides of the Wujia River, northeast of Wuyuan, for two days and nights. On the night of the 27th, the Japanese army scurried to the suburbs of Wuyuan, and part of it scurried into the city, engaging in close combat street fighting with the Chinese army. The Japanese army was fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, and by the 30th, it could no longer hold out and began a general retreat. On the 1st of this month, all the Japanese troops inside and outside the city of Wuyuan were wiped out by the Chinese army. The Chinese army now completely controls the entire western Sui area, as far west as the Wula Mountains, and is advancing east towards Baotou. Wuyuan needs to be relieved, because as a result of the fierce fighting, the entire city has been almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. Li Zhuoyi (transliteration), the financial commissioner of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, and 30 representatives from various public organizations are heading to Wuyuan to investigate the situation and supervise the relief work.

<p>Chongqing. Anqin Hutuktu, a member of the Central Committee, recently telegraphed the central authorities from Tibet, supporting the National Government, obeying the sole leader, and wishing for victory in the war of resistance, refuting the Japanese and puppet rhetoric. The dispatch said, "In the summer of the 27th year, Anqin traveled north to preach the Dharma, but was stranded in Tianjin and Beijing due to the incident, and almost lost his freedom. He returned to Tibet with difficulty in the spring month of the previous year, but has been suffering from a foot ailment, making it difficult to walk, and has been living in seclusion for many years, without taking a step out of Tashilhunpo. However, he prays daily for the victory of our country's war of resistance by chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha. I remember that Anqin holds a position in the central government, and is loyal to the party and the country. Tibet has long been Chinese territory, and he personally has received great favors from the National Government. At this time of all-out war of resistance, how dare he forget the righteousness of the entire nation fighting against the common enemy? As long as Anqin has a breath left, he will only support the National Government and obey the sole leader." (Dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e23">British Government Statement to Parliament: Far East Policy Consistent with US and France; Butler Answers Questions from Members of the House of Commons: British Government Strictly Adheres to the Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty; But Does Not Oppose Improving Relations with Japan <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London – British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie's recent speech at the Anglo-Japanese Association meeting, reviewing the general trend of Anglo-Japanese relations, became a point of questioning in the House of Commons last night. Labor MP Noel-Baker asked whether Craigie's wording in his speech indicated any change in the British government's Far East policy, or whether the British government was indeed fulfilling its policy of assisting the Chinese National Government under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek in letter and spirit. He asked the Prime Minister to explain this. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that Craigie did not indicate any change in the British government's policy. The British government continues to recognize the Chongqing government as the legitimate government of China and has not changed its view of wishing to resolve disputes on fair terms. Noel-Baker then asked whether it was unfortunate that the Japanese side had the impression that although the British people were resisting aggression in Europe, they would tolerate aggression in Asia. Butler replied that he hoped the Japanese side did not have this impression, but he was satisfied that the wording of his reply would dispel this impression. Labor MP Henderson asked, in view of the misunderstanding caused by Craigie's speech, whether the Prime Minister would clearly state that the British government still adheres to the terms of the Nine-Power Treaty and will continue to implement them until all signatory countries agree to abolish or amend them. Butler replied that, indeed, Britain has always strived to implement its Far East policy based on all the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and to maintain consistent steps with the US and French governments. Labor MP Wedgewood asked whether the Prime Minister had paid attention to the words in Craigie's speech, "The two countries (Britain and Japan) are now striving for the same goal," and "It is not beyond the ability of constructive politicians to bring the national policy objectives of both sides into complete harmony." He asked whether the government would explicitly deny this kind of view. (Members of the government party shouted "No, no.") Butler replied that taking things out of context was unhelpful and that it would be more valuable to view what he (Butler) said as representing government policy. Furthermore, the government does not oppose improving its relations with Japan. (Members of the government party cheered.) The House of Lords also discussed Craigie's speech. Lord Maugham spoke, saying that while we want Anglo-Japanese relations to be on a sound footing and welcome Craigie's efforts to this end, Craigie's remarks could be seen as Britain acquiescing in Japan's actions in recent years and recognizing its policies. It should be known that Japan's aggression against China is unanimously condemned by the world. Foreign Secretary Halifax replied that he had seen the original text of the speech in more detail than reported. In addition to answering questions in the same vein as Butler's reply in the House of Commons, Halifax said that he did not believe that the policies revealed in the speech conflicted with the efforts to put Anglo-Japanese relations on a friendly footing. Craigie had done his best in this regard, and this is what he was eager to promote in his speech. (4th Reuters telegram)</p>

<p>London – Chinese Ambassador to Britain Quo Tai-chi gave a speech at a luncheon hosted by the "English Association" today, stating that the peace that Japan wants to create in the Far East is the same peace that Britain and France are taking up arms against in Europe, which is the so-called "peace of the grave."

<p>Tokyo – A Japanese naval spokesman told the press today that if the US Navy expands its exercises to the Far East and brings its sword close to Japanese territory, Japan will consider its actions as a sign of aggression against Japan. The spokesman also said that every country has the right to conduct military exercises to protect its sovereignty, but it cannot needlessly engage in war games. The spokesman also said that even if the US Navy crosses international shipping lanes during these exercises, the Japanese Navy will continue its policy of "no threat, no aggression" and will dock its warships west of international shipping lanes. If the Japanese Navy's exercises were to expand to the eastern Pacific, what would be the attitude of the United States? The spokesman repeatedly stated that Japan does not want the European war to spread to the Far East. The Japanese Navy has strongly protested to Britain about the discovery of British cruisers in Japanese waters. (4th United Press telegram)</p>

<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Halifax successively met with Chinese Ambassador to Britain Quo Tai-chi and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Mamoru yesterday. The Foreign Secretary's conversation with the Japanese ambassador mainly concerned the difficulties faced by Japan in trade after the outbreak of the European war. Reliable sources said that the Japanese ambassador mentioned the British interference with Japanese mail and also requested the Foreign Secretary to report on the possible impact of the resolutions of the Anglo-French Defense Conference last Tuesday. A Japanese spokesperson told United Press reporters last night that the Japanese ambassador and the British Foreign Secretary did not discuss the "new government" in Nanjing or other Chinese issues. As for what Ambassador Quo discussed with the British Foreign Secretary, it was about various issues concerning China. It is said that Ambassador Quo presented a memorandum to the Foreign Secretary regarding obstacles to delivery related to the British loan to China last autumn. It is generally believed that Ambassador Quo also mentioned the declaration by US Secretary of State Hull and the speech given by British Ambassador to Japan Craigie on March 28.

<p>Tokyo – Japanese Naval Ministry spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa said that rumors that Japan intends to provide Hainan Island to Germany for use as a naval base are unfounded. He also said that British claims of extending the blockade policy to the Pacific are also unfounded. The Japanese Navy will oppose any attempt to allow the European war to affect Japanese territorial waters. A foreign reporter raised the following question: If British warships were to pass through the Tsushima Strait with the aim of blockading Vladivostok, would Japan protest? Kanazawa replied that if British warships were to take such action, it would cause a very serious reaction. (4th Haitong telegram)</p>
<p>London – According to certain sources, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy Department once expressed the view that the department firmly opposes the expansion of the current European war to the vicinity of Japan. Therefore, the Japanese government would not welcome any activities of British warships in the waters near Japan. Responsible officials here recently commented on this news, stating that it is indeed the case that the Japanese side has repeatedly expressed its hope to Britain during informal exchanges of views that Britain should refrain from taking illegal actions to avoid stimulating Japanese emotions. However, in Britain's view, it cannot voluntarily abandon its rights as a belligerent, so it should still fully exercise this right when necessary. What can be asserted is that Britain has no intention of adopting illegal measures. (4th Havas telegram)</p>

<p>Moscow – Observers here commented on Soviet-Japanese relations, saying that the commercial negotiations between the two sides, which were originally said to be likely to reach an agreement by the middle of last month, have apparently failed to achieve any success for the time being due to differences in their respective viewpoints and their unwillingness to compromise. In addition, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov has recently focused on negotiations with Finland and has had no time to attend to other matters, which is also a fact. Although a peace treaty has been concluded between Finland and the Soviet Union, the negotiations between the two sides have not yet been completely concluded. In general, the Soviet government must improve political relations with a country at the same time as it promotes commercial relations with that country. When Japan and the Soviet Union began commercial negotiations, there was also a proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, as of now, it is rare to know what stage the negotiations on the conclusion of this treaty have reached. Generally speaking, the primary role of this Soviet move is to create a propaganda material to enhance its own reputation in the eyes of communists and other sympathizers in capitalist countries. However, the Japanese side demanded a high price, even demanding that the boundaries of the two countries in the Far East be effectively surveyed, which is tantamount to forcing the Soviet Union to implicitly recognize the status quo in China, which is not welcomed by the Soviet Union. In short, regarding the issue of the demarcation of the border between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japanese side demanded to obtain certain benefits, while the Soviet Union demanded that the Japanese army withdraw from a certain location, a location that caused the Nomonhan Incident. The two sides held their own opinions and were at a stalemate. Since the political relations between the two countries cannot be improved, the current commercial negotiations are also slow to achieve any success. (3rd Havas telegram)</p>

<p>Washington – The US House Appropriations Committee yesterday passed the Army Appropriations Bill, totaling US$785,999,094, a reduction of US$67,357,660 from what President Roosevelt had proposed. The committee, according to a new policy, allowed the US Army to transfer orders for airplanes to Britain and France, so it canceled the US Army's original order for 439 airplanes. The bill also canceled the allocation of US$12,734,000 for the construction of an air base in Anchorage, Alaska. US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall said when attending the Appropriations Committee, "If the European war breaks out in late spring or summer, we must be ready before the artillery fire extends to the Western Hemisphere. If there is any evolution of scale in the overseas situation, our country must be especially vigilant at the same time." General Marshall requested an increase of 15,000 in the regular army and an increase in the budget of US$39,000,000 for the purchase of tanks, rifles, and artillery, so that once war breaks out, the United States can send a million troops to the battlefield to serve in four months. Marshall also requested the restoration of the funding for the construction of an air base in Anchorage, "to prevent the area from being occupied by the enemy and to enable the United States to use the base as an air and naval operations base in the North Pacific. The Appropriations Committee also reduced the exercise funds by US$1 million, mostly from the Philippines and Hawaii. The Philippines portion was reduced from US$112,000 to US$7,000, while the Hawaii portion was reduced from US$219,000 to US$119,000. The bill includes US$645,000 for Hawaii emergency exercises and US$334,000 for Philippines emergency exercises. (4th United Press telegram)</p>

<p>Paris – Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a broadcast speech to the United States tonight, explaining the significance of this war and strongly arguing that the peace desired by Britain and France is not to conclude another peace with Germany, but to secure safety for all small countries and establish a lasting peace. The main points of the speech are listed below. The Prime Minister first said, "I am giving a speech tonight, not to offer advice to you. You can decide for yourselves what you want to do and what you don't want to do. But one thing we firmly believe is that the number of your people who wish for Britain and France to win is very large. If wishing can become a positive force, then I believe we can triumph tomorrow morning. The more clearly you understand the significance of the current war, the more beneficial it will be to us. This is an undeniable argument. This war is very different from any other war. The neutral countries of Europe are helping Hitler on the one hand, but hoping for Hitler's defeat on the other. There is no greater contradiction than this. Today, the French people all know that their freedom and rights have been threatened by national socialism, and they also know that the Soviet Union is betraying democracy and willingly colluding with Germany. Therefore, the reasons for our war today are clearer than ever before. Since totalitarian Germany has no credibility, it would be insane for us to establish a compromise plan with it. Therefore, the peace desired by Britain and France is not to conclude another peace with Germany, but to rely on victory to secure safety for all small countries, thereby establishing a lasting peace. In other words, we must prevent future aggression in Europe and build a new continent where good people can live and work in peace. We are not fighting only for our own interests, but to ensure peace in Europe and to restore the integrity of the countries that have been dismembered. In short, Britain and France are fighting for freedom, confident that they have the strength to win, and they will certainly achieve victory." (3rd Havas telegram)</p>

<p>Milan: Italian public opinion believes that the failure of the French to provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the French illustrated magazine publishing a photograph of Premier Reynaud standing in front of a surprising new map could worsen Franco-Italian relations. The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" pointed out that the national borders drawn on the map show the war ambitions of Britain and France. The intention of Britain and France is to divide European countries, which will sow the seeds of strife and cause our descendants to fight endlessly. It also stated that Paris's strong denial is not worth a knowing smile. The facts are obvious, and clever arguments cannot hide them. The French must know that no less than ten million Italians will defend their country with bayonets. Do not assume that wild fantasies can easily become reality. The views of the evening newspaper published here on this matter are generally the same as those of "Il Popolo d'Italia," believing that the French are arguing strongly and are not to be trusted.

<p>Swiss Capital: On April 20th, the 51st birthday of the German leader Adolf Hitler, German Aviation Minister Hermann Goering has launched a nationwide campaign to collect metal as a birthday celebration. Every German family should hand over at least 30 kilograms of tin, copper, or lead. Monuments or statues made of metal throughout the country, except those listed as famous monuments, should be handed over to the war industry for smelting and application. For example, the bronze statue of Frederick I of Prussia in Berlin, containing tons of copper, should also be smelted. The mayor of Bielefeld has removed the copper fences and railings of the local savings bank, for which he has received an award from the government. In addition, members of sports associations and organizations throughout Germany have also been ordered to hand over badges, trophies, and other items. Anyone who conceals metal and hinders the success of the above-mentioned campaign will reportedly be sentenced to death. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>

<p>Swiss Capital: The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently published a dispatch from Berlin stating that the German authorities are currently intensifying conscription work. All men born in 1903-04 have been incorporated into the army. When the German government abolished the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and restored conscription in March 1935, these two age groups were not enlisted because they were over 30 years old. Therefore, they are only being called up at this time. At present, from the 1905 class to the 1919 class, the men of each class have generally been enlisted. In addition, the German military authorities have also recruited men over the age of 40, that is, soldiers who participated in the last European war, to make use of their combat experience to guide young recruits. According to the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung," the number of German active-duty soldiers is approximately six million. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Reorganization of the Chamberlain Cabinet: Mutual Relations of Various Departments Re-adjusted, Churchill Presides Over the Defense Committee <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>London: The reorganization of the British Cabinet has been completed. The list of new ministers has been approved by King George VI as follows:</p>
<p>London: Regarding the reorganization of the British Cabinet, 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, recently issued a communiqué stating that the Prime Minister's reorganization of the cabinet this time is intended to slightly change the relationship between the cabinet members participating in the Cabinet War Committee and other cabinet members. The goal is to achieve full cooperation between the various departments of the cabinet and to report important issues that arise in each department to the Cabinet War Committee at any time. After General Lord Chatfield, Minister for Coordination of Defence, resigns, it is not intended to appoint another person to succeed him, but a Defence Committee will be organized by the ministers of the relevant defence departments, presided over by the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill and the oldest of the ministers of each department, with the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force as advisors. The Committee will meet regularly to represent the Cabinet War Committee, monitor the strategic situation and the progress of operations on the front lines, and make recommendations to the Cabinet War Committee on general operational policies at any time. In addition, the Minister of Munitions should also be allowed to participate in the Defence Committee to directly engage with the various national defence issues related to munitions. (Third Day, Havas)</p>
<p>London: The Prime Minister's Office recently issued an official notice stating that some senior officials who are now being reassigned to less important positions are by no means dissatisfied with their handling of departmental affairs. It is purely out of the absolute necessity to make the most of the services of each cabinet member. The Prime Minister's aim is to achieve complete coordination of the work of the related departments and to keep the War Cabinet informed of major issues. The position of Minister for Coordination of Defence, vacated after Lord Chatfield's resignation, will be temporarily suspended, and the Minister of Supply will henceforth join the State Council chaired by Churchill. Lord Chatfield's letter of resignation stated that the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence was necessary in peacetime, but the establishment of the War Cabinet has greatly reduced his wartime responsibilities, because his powers to coordinate departmental affairs and make major decisions must automatically be transferred to the control of the Prime Minister. Therefore, he requested resignation. Chamberlain's reply stated that the current situation is very different from what was expected when the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence was established. He is very grateful for Chatfield's contributions and his performance in handling various affairs. He now intends to make some changes to benefit the war effort and slightly reduce the duties undertaken by Chatfield, but he hopes that he can find other ways for Chatfield's talents to be used for the country and to achieve victory. A Reuters parliamentary correspondent stated that Sir Samuel Hoare has previously served as Secretary of State for Air twice, and his reappointment is welcomed because it is now gradually being questioned whether the Air Ministry needs a stimulant. Hoare's previous achievements as Secretary of State for Air and the Navy will reassure critics when he takes up this position again. Hoare has never diminished his intense interest in the Air Force, and it is said that he has very practical plans for finding the best way to achieve maximum aircraft production. The Defence Committee chaired by Churchill in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty will meet regularly, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will attend as advisors. It is said that the War Cabinet often reviews the main factors in the war situation and presents strategies for operations. The new Lord Privy Seal Sir Kingsley Wood will be the chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee to consider all domestic issues, and will also be the chairman of the Food Policy Committee. At the same time, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon will remain chairman of the Economic Policy Committee to coordinate the overall undertaking of various departments regarding national economic efforts. Lord Beaverbrook has been appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Air Ministry's Aircraft Production, with specified authority to accelerate aircraft production. (Fourth Day, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters parliamentary correspondent claims that comments in Parliament on the Cabinet reshuffle are divided into two factions: one faction believes it has not gone far enough, and the other believes it is appropriate. Some commentators say that simply reshuffling a few people will not help, some express dissatisfaction with individuals, and some regret not forming a smaller war cabinet. However, the opinion of a certain group is that the Prime Minister has tried to cope with the changing situation. If he did not reduce the war cabinet or drastically change personnel this time, future developments should move in this direction. In short, this reshuffle did not cause unrest in the political circles, and the general public is particularly concerned about the future secret meeting of Parliament, hoping to be able to express their opinions on the mountains, advocate for a more active policy, and ask the government for a more detailed explanation of the policies it has implemented. All of this is inconvenient to do in open meetings. (Fourth Day, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Hague: Political figures in London believe that the result of the British Cabinet reshuffle is an enhancement of Churchill's position. Although the Defence Committee is subject to the supervision of the Cabinet, the decision of strategy will be discussed by the Committee. Moreover, Secretary of State for Air Sir Kingsley Wood, a confidant of Prime Minister Chamberlain, has been transferred to Lord Privy Seal, which is a symbol of the rise and fall of the power of Churchill and Chamberlain. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>
<p>No Major Changes in General Policy</p>
<p>London: The matter of the Cabinet reshuffle has recently been commented on by people in the Parliament's waiting room. It is said that although there are as many as eleven cabinet members who have been transferred, there will not be any major changes in general policy. The number of cabinet members in the War Cabinet has been reduced from nine to eight. It is evident that Prime Minister Chamberlain has no intention of reducing it further. The nature of this War Cabinet is described by French Prime Minister Reynaud as "not too few in discussion, not too many in decision." In addition, there are two noteworthy points in the Cabinet reshuffle: first, the appointment of First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill as Chairman of the Defence Committee, responsible for deciding on operational policies, is greatly supported by the general public and members of Parliament. This is another clear sign that Britain and France are determined to fight with all their might. Second, Prime Minister Chamberlain's proposal to enable full cooperation between the various departments of the Cabinet has been put into practice. The transfer of Lord Privy Seal Sir Samuel Hoare to Secretary of State for Air is due to the fact that the former Secretary of State for Air Sir Kingsley Wood has been criticized by some quarters. Sir Samuel Hoare has served as Secretary of State for Air twice, and he will be able to perform his duties with ease. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>
<p>Lord Chatfield Has Resigned</p>
<p>London: General Lord Chatfield, Minister for Coordination of Defence, recently submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Chamberlain, stating that during the war, the power to make decisions for the Ministry for Coordination of Defence should be personally held by the Prime Minister. If his resignation can benefit Your Lordship's plan to reorganize the Cabinet, please approve it. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that he was currently considering changes to several cabinet members to benefit the war effort. He had mentioned this matter to Your Lordship once. However, this change would reduce Your Lordship's authority. Since Your Lordship wishes to resign, he must reluctantly grant the request. (Third Day, Havas)</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Views of People in Various Countries</p>
<p>The Hague: After the British Cabinet reshuffle, it is generally said here that the position of First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill has been strengthened as a result. The "Algemeen Handelsblad" even referred to the new British Cabinet as the "Chamberlain-Halifax-Churchill Cabinet." The "De Telegraaf" reported that when Prime Minister Chamberlain retires one day, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill is very likely to succeed as Prime Minister. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian observers have recently commented on the British Cabinet reshuffle, saying that First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill has taken a leading position in the new Cabinet, which shows the country's intention to intensify the war. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: Newspapers here believe that the British Cabinet reshuffle is "just a parliamentary charade." The semi-official "Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro" stated that the British Cabinet reshuffle is a strategy to stabilize people's hearts. After the Cabinet reshuffle, Churchill's power has increased, but the personnel within the Cabinet have not changed, only their duties have been transferred. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" reported that after the British Cabinet reshuffle, its nature has not changed, and the new Cabinet will increasingly feel the control of Churchill's ideas. (Fourth Day, Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: The speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons yesterday has recently been commented on by people from all walks of life here. It is said that Britain and France are determined to eradicate German National Socialism as soon as possible. It can be seen that, in terms of public opinion, since Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles' visit to Europe, it has been known that there is no hope for peace in Europe at present. Britain and France should begin to intensify the war. Political figures still express sympathy for the positions of Britain and France, and they also welcome their governments' determination to intensify the war. However, they hope that American export trade will not be hampered. Regarding this matter, economic experts from Britain and France are negotiating with the American authorities, which will be concluded soon. After that, although American trade with Europe will be subject to certain restrictions due to the British and French blockade, the friendly relations that they maintain with each other in business will not be affected in any way.

<p>The Hague: Following repeated strafing of Dutch fishing vessels by German aircraft, and after the Dutch government lodged a strong protest with the German government, Member of Parliament Woudenberg submitted a written inquiry to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense during today's parliamentary session, requesting clarification of the development of the matter, and whether the government intends to implement military escort measures for such fishing vessels. Member of Parliament Compben also raised an inquiry, demanding a clear explanation as to whether it was true that the government had recently allowed Germany to operate an air route between Berlin and The Hague. He stated that since Germany had refused the Dutch airline to participate in this route, and the government had granted the right to operate the route to Germany, it should be explained whether this was in the interests of the country. He concluded that the government must strictly implement military inspection measures at The Hague Airport to check overseas airmail and prevent the leakage of national information abroad.

<h3 id="e68">Circling Three Thousand Miles: From Xi'an to Shanghai <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Ping</p>
<p>Dian-Shaan Railway Nears Completion; Tongguan, Ningjing, and Luoyang Flourish</p>
<p>Due to my duties, I have traveled tens of thousands of miles in the past two years, from South China to North China, from Southwest to Northwest, and have not spent a moment not being excited. This time, coming from Xi'an to Shanghai, the journey gave me a lot of material, which perhaps everyone wants to know about, so I will now briefly describe it below.</p>
<p>Farewell, Xi'an</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since I left Xi'an, and perhaps there is not much difference between Xi'an a month ago and Xi'an now. When I left, it was the Lunar New Year, and some places were covered with snow. On the war front, only in Suiyuan, the Chinese army was advancing into Wuyuan. Apart from Suiyuan, the Northwest can be said to be silent. Secondly, talking about the construction of the Northwest, it is not as good as the Southwest. Although the Northwest is not as good as the Southwest, all aspects of construction are being carried out with all efforts. Getting on the Longhai Railway train, I remembered that before the war, from Xi'an to Shanghai, via the Longhai Railway to Xuzhou and changing trains, it would take no more than three days to reach Shanghai directly. Now, of course, it is not as convenient as before. The Longhai Railway itself has undergone a great change. The railway from Lianyungang in the East Sea directly to the West has become several sections. The section from Lianyungang to Xuzhou was destroyed during the Battle of Xuzhou. The section from Xuzhou west to Kaifeng is now occupied. The section from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou has been destroyed. The section from Zhengzhou to Luoyang has been dismantled by our side to extend it westward. The current Longhai Railway can be said to only have the section from Luoyang to Baoji. Among them, the section reaching the pass, due to its proximity to Fenglingdu, is often subjected to artillery fire, so the train cannot pass directly, and passengers and goods must walk a distance of eighty li.</p>
<p>News about the railway is not widely publicized in the rear. However, everyone pays close attention to it. The main artery connecting the Southwest and Northwest, from Kunming to Xi'an, is scheduled to be completed within a specified time limit. Anyone passing through this road can see tens of thousands of people constantly working. Not long ago, or rather, two months ago, I participated in the opening ceremony of a newly completed railway. The deputy director and chief engineer excitedly talked to us about the railway situation, saying that they are making the greatest efforts to complete their tasks.</p>
<p>Arriving at Tongguan</p>
<p>In recent years, I can say that I have constantly traveled on the Longhai Railway train. In March and April of last year, it was still possible to travel directly from Luoyang to Xi'an. After May, it was no longer possible to pass. At that time, the Japanese army invaded Maojindu from Zhongtiao Mountain and shelled the iron bridge of Lingbao, thus interrupting the Longhai Road. However, there is now a considerable solution to this problem. During a certain opening ceremony, the deputy director said that it could be fundamentally resolved in three months.</p>
<p>This time when I passed through Tongguan, the situation was the same as before. The front line was peaceful and quiet. Tongguan and Fengling are only separated by a river, with both sides facing each other, without even the sound of gunfire. The city tower of Tongguan still stands majestically, close to the mountains and water, undiminished in its historical grandeur.</p>
<p>Passing Through Luoyang</p>
<p>Wartime Luoyang, although under Japanese bombing, has not reduced its prosperity. In the past, Luoyang was only an ordinary commercial area, but now it has acquired a military and political status. Its prosperity is greater than in the past. Every time we come from the front, we can get satisfactory comfort. Here, there are soldiers and civilians, all living in tension, and have already developed a great spirit. The troops and the common people are amiable and approachable.</p>
<p>When I left Luoyang, it was the Lantern Festival of the Lunar calendar. Every household was hung with red lanterns, decorated with lanterns and streamers. The lively scene in the streets can be said to have never been seen before. Why is it so lively? This clearly shows that everyone has absolute faith in the war. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e69">After Returning to Chongqing, the Scientific Expedition to Xikang Holds Exhibition of Cultural Relics; Difficulties in Transporting Large Quantities of Timber Outward; Border Education Shows Progress <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Aviation News: The Xikang Scientific Expedition Team, organized by the China Society of Natural Sciences, consisting of more than twenty people, divided into four groups: geography and meteorology, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry and medicine, and engineering, entered Xikang for investigation. It took three months, traversed all important areas of Xikang, and collected a large number of samples. From March 6th, the Society, in conjunction with the Border Affairs Research Association, held a public exhibition at the YMCA for three days, displaying a total of more than six hundred samples, either famous local products or precious cultural relics, all of which were valuable. At the same time, the team also hosted a tea party for the press, reporting on the investigation process. According to Zhu Xiaobin, the leader of the Geography and Meteorology Group,</p>
<p>Forests Everywhere</p>
<p>Xikang has a very high terrain, about 3,000 meters above sea level, and its highest peak, Gongga Mountain, reaches more than 7,000 meters. Therefore, the climate is extremely cold, and the highest temperature in summer is only fourteen degrees Celsius. This makes it extremely unsuitable for planting crops. The entire region only produces highland barley and barley, and other crops are rarely seen. However, forests are almost everywhere, and the available timber is usually two or three hugs in circumference and twenty or thirty feet tall. Unfortunately, transportation is difficult, and it is impossible to transport it outwards, resulting in the goods being abandoned on the ground, and no one developing them. Sometimes, they are even considered by the locals to hinder agricultural production, and are cut down or burned in large quantities, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Difficult Gold Mining</p>
<p>Although the yield of medicinal materials is very abundant, those who collect the medicine only know how to take it and do not know how to cultivate it. In the future, artificial means should be used to strengthen the cultivation of water chestnut production, so that it can be taken inexhaustibly and used inexhaustibly. Talking about the general social situation is not something that can be exhausted in a single word. Nine out of ten Kang people believe in Buddhism, and every family is proud to have their children become lamas. Therefore, one-third of the men in Kang are lamas. In the past, people generally believed that Xikang was full of gold. After this team's investigation into Kang, it was believed that this statement should be revised. Although there are now more than thirty gold diggers in Xikang, they are all mining placer gold, and often put in a lot of effort but achieve little. The so-called "gold everywhere" is not something that can be said without personal experience. Xikang lacks manpower, not only intellectuals, but even ordinary coolies are from Sichuan. Therefore, after returning from the investigation of Xikang, I believe that the first thing to do to develop the area is to open up transportation, so that the products of the interior and exterior can flow smoothly. The second is to intensify education, so that the local people can directly pay attention to production. Those who go outside to work should pay special attention to their personality cultivation, so as to avoid rumors.</p>
<p>At the Exhibition</p>
<p>At the exhibition, what first struck us was the richness of Xikang's resources. On a mineral distribution map, dense symbols representing coal, lead, aluminum, nitrate, zinc, oil, and gold covered the entire paper. The output was not specified, but from the multitude of categories alone, it was startling enough. According to Zhu Binghai, the executive director of the expedition team, Xikang's resources, apart from minerals, are most notable for medicinal materials and forests. There are large trees that several people cannot encircle, and large forests that cannot be walked through in several days and nights. The most regrettable thing is that arable land is relatively scarce. More than half of the daily necessities of the Kang people exhibited here are made of steel, and there are also woolen textiles, which are currently considered too expensive for most people to afford. However, the clothing of the Kang people on display is not only entirely woolen, but even the bags for packing salt are made of wool. We attribute this to the failure to adjust the marketing of products, but what we still feel is the richness of the resources, which are still waiting to be developed. In addition, the strong religious atmosphere also filled the venue. We saw many finely drawn Buddhist images, as well as various ritual objects that we had never seen before. Regarding this, Zhu Binghai talked about some things, "Most people always think that the difficult problem of developing the border areas is how to resolve the ethnic issues. However, according to our months of experience, we believe that the Tibetans in Xikang are essentially simple and honest. As long as you treat them with sincerity, nothing cannot be solved."</p>
<p>Educational Progress</p>
<p>Browsing to the "Culture and Education" section, there are elementary school textbooks compiled by the Xikang Elementary School Textbook Compilation Committee, with Tibetan on one side and Mandarin on the other. We cannot help but admit that these textbooks with two languages side by side are a powerful tool for developing the culture of the border areas. Moreover, there are indeed achievements to be seen here. A diary of a Tibetan child named Gu Wenguang, and a composition by Wu Weilan, an eleven-year-old student in the third grade of the Kangding Tibetan Girls' School, written in Han Chinese, were surprisingly fluent. Perhaps some people will think this is a miracle, but with these textbooks and homework displayed side by side, it undoubtedly tells us that this is the success of the use of educational tools. The four walls of the venue were covered with photographs of Xikang, including forests, birds and animals, customs, houses, chestnut trees, and the situation of the expedition team on the journey, all-encompassing. It attracted many people, who inquired about each picture in detail. Several precious animal specimens, such as golden monkey skins, yak tails, etc., aroused people's utmost interest.

From 9:05 to 9:25 a.m., Ms. Heidi Hunt, head of the Children's Protection Section of the Municipal Council (Austrian), lectured on "Children's Protection Issues" (translated by Chen Zhengfan). The gist of it was that the Children's Protection Section was established in December 1938, and its current work is divided into rescuing child laborers, rescuing beggars (street children), rescuing child prostitutes, rescuing lost and abandoned children, etc. Since its establishment, the department has received much assistance from Chinese and Western people in Shanghai, various child welfare organizations, and church organizations, and has cooperated to the best of its ability, for which it is grateful. Today is Chinese Children's Day, and I personally witness the enthusiasm shown by Chinese society for children, which deeply moves me. If Chinese people can value children so much, the future of China is full of happiness and brightness. I extend my warmest wishes to the progress of Chinese childcare, and I predict that the future development of China is limitless. From 9:25 to 10:00 a.m., Lin Juehou, Yuan Luedeng, and others lectured on the meaning of Children's Day. Lin Kanglao subtracted 60 years from his age and became only 5 years old, hoping that all children can strive for progress in all aspects of knowledge, morality, and physique, so as not to betray Children's Day. When Yuan Luelao gave his speech, he brought up the story of Yue Fei's mother tattooing his back to teach her son, encouraging all mothers to emulate Yue Fei's mother and all sons to emulate Yue Fei.

<p>All Circles Send Condolences to Refugee and Orphan Children</p>
<p>This year's Children's Day, in addition to general children's welfare, paid special attention to comforting refugee children. Gifts were presented from all walks of life, and various cinemas invited them to free movies, all of which were aimed at refugee children. Because refugee children were most affected by the war.

<h3 id="e76">Britain and the United States Decide to Cooperate to Restrict Japan, The Election Situation Turns Favorable, British and American Expats Have Considerable Confidence, Five Chinese Directors Have Been Recommended for Re-election <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The election for the Shanghai Municipal Council directors is scheduled for the 10th and 11th, from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, at the Wan Guo Business Regiment Training Ground and the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market. As the election approaches, British and American taxpayers are deeply aware of Japan's intentions in suddenly increasing the number of candidates to five. The first step is to increase the number of Japanese seats, and further to interfere in the administration of the concession and disrupt its existing state. Therefore, they are strongly opposed and have decided to adopt a united front to deal with it. However, judging from the current situation, the Japanese side is quite well-prepared, and the momentum is quite strong. Therefore, according to estimates, the number of votes the Japanese side expects, although it may not exceed that of the British and Americans, is not much different. German and Russian expats have become a pivotal force, and people from various countries are actively campaigning in the hope of winning the support of these minority taxpayers. The night before last, there were rumors that American taxpayers, in view of the deteriorating environment, had suggested that this year's election should not be held. However, this was denied yesterday. This election battle will become increasingly fierce. The outcome is of great importance to the welfare of the residents of the concession, and therefore cannot be taken lightly. The following is a record of the developments yesterday:</p>
<p>Important Resolutions of the American Expatriate Association</p>
<p>The American Expatriate Association convened an emergency meeting last night and decided to mobilize all American expatriates in Shanghai to participate in the Municipal Council election to be held next week. The authorities passed the following important resolutions: (1) Appoint Burt, the instructor of the Naval Youth Association, to organize an election campaign committee to do its best to ensure that every American expatriate participates in the voting. (2) All American expatriates must vote for seven candidates (two American expatriates and five British expatriates) among the British and American expatriates. At the same time, under the guidance of the election committee, all American expatriates, in addition to voting for the seven people, must not vote for expatriates of other nationalities. Most importantly, American expatriates must absolutely not vote for Japanese candidates. (Note: In 1936, American expatriates voted for Japanese candidates.)</p>
<p>Also last night, the British Expatriate Association held an important meeting. Although the details are not known, according to reliable sources, the resolutions passed by the British Expatriate Association are similar to those of the American Expatriate Association.</p>
<p>Taking United Action to Resist the Japanese</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the American Expatriate Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss election matters. The authorities on the American side unanimously advocated that British and American expatriates in Shanghai should abandon their previous disagreements and take united action in this election to counter the Japanese. A well-known American expatriate told reporters yesterday that the only thing that should be noted in this election is how to prevent the Japanese from expanding their military power in the occupied areas to the concession area. The discussion at the meeting focused on two issues: the number of votes obtained by the British expatriate candidates is only determined by the 3,350 votes obtained by the Japanese expatriate candidates, and the election of Funa MacDonald as an independent candidate has become a hindrance. The current situation is to predict the number of seats the Japanese may obtain in the Municipal Council this time. According to reliable sources, the situation of this election is very different from the past. Due to the war in Europe, Western expatriates of other nationalities in Shanghai may take a position against British expatriates. However, judging from the results of yesterday's meeting, the American side is mostly willing to support British expatriate candidates.</p>
<p>Collecting Votes and Strengthening the Chen Line</p>
<p>The British and American Expatriate Associations both held lengthy discussions last night on how to win the support of taxpayers of other nationalities. The American Expatriate Association resolved that all American expatriates should unanimously vote for five British expatriate candidates and two American expatriate candidates, and completely ignore the Japanese expatriate candidates and Mr. Reynolds MacDonald. Americans have no ill feelings towards MacDonald, but because his participation may affect the American expatriates' ability to obtain two seats in the Municipal Council, it is very important, so they have to do so. The American Expatriate Association also resolved yesterday to elect Mr. Jue De as the chairman, and to collect all American expatriate election votes on the 10th and 11th. He told reporters that he hopes that British and American expatriates can take completely united action in the near future and participate in this election.</p>
<p>American Women Participate Unanimously</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that members of the American Women's Association and other American women are scheduled to hold a meeting at the association hall at 577 Jing'an Temple Road at 11:00 AM on the 5th to discuss the election of the directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council. It is reported that members of the association and other American women residing in apartments and other houses all have the right to vote, but they do not know it and have not registered with the Municipal Council. Therefore, at tomorrow's meeting, they will report on the procedures for obtaining voting rights and voting, so that American women can participate in the voting unanimously.</p>
<p>American Expatriates Oppose Extending Voting</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that major American merchants in the city intend to advocate extending the election of the directors of the Municipal Council. The reporter asked Mr. Fister, the chairman of the American Expatriate Association, about this. He replied that the proposal to ask the consular corps to postpone the election is impractical. After hearing people mention this plan, I contacted the majority of American expatriates, and they all said that this is the concept of defeatism and have unanimously expressed their opposition. The committee of the American Expatriate Association will never discuss this plan, and the consular corps has not heard anyone request an extension of the election. I only learned about this when I read the news in the Morning Post today.</p>
<p>Some People Suggest Postponing the Election</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that important taxpayers on the American side in Shanghai discussed the possibility of postponing this year's election of the directors of the Municipal Council last night. Because the current situation in the city is abnormal, and the Municipal Council cannot completely manage the entire Public Concession, especially the northern and eastern districts. After the war, various conditions in the area are extremely chaotic. It is believed that there are sufficient reasons to apply to the Shanghai Consular Corps to postpone the election date scheduled for the 10th and 11th of this month.</p>
<p>British and American Cooperation Can Achieve Victory</p>
<p>British and American expatriates have many speculations about the results of this election, and some people still believe that the Japanese may not win in the election. According to British and American officials, this will depend on whether expatriates of various countries can organize a united front.</p>
<p>The Final Result is Unpredictable</p>
<p>The Japanese in this city can cast about 3,700 votes. Taxpayers of other countries can cast more than 5,000 votes. Among the minority expatriates, the German expatriates, including German and Austrian refugees, can cast 600 votes, of which 400 votes belong to Jewish refugees. Most of them live on the north bank of Suzhou Creek. The Japanese are currently trying their best to persuade them. However, if taxpayers of other countries all elect candidates of their own nationality and do not cast a single vote for the two candidates the Japanese should have, then even if the Japanese obtain 70% of the Jewish voting rights and part or all of the German expatriates' voting rights, they may not win.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Attitude of German Expatriates</p>
<p>There are about 1,600 or 1,700 German expatriates in Shanghai, and the number of qualified voters among them is also important in this Municipal Council election. According to news from the German Embassy to the Pingming News reporter, the German government has no opinion on this Municipal Council election. Other groups are engaged in election matters. It is reported that there are more than 700 qualified German expatriate voters. Due to the influence of the European situation, they may vote in favor of Japanese directors, or they may vote in favor of American expatriates. This point is still unknown.</p>
<p>Jewish People Express a Conservative and Neutral Stance</p>
<p>As the election date is approaching, the Japanese are trying to induce taxpayers of other countries to provide assistance. However, according to news from the Shanghai European Refugee Relief Committee and the International Refugee Relief Committee, Mr. Gomo has issued a statement on the attitude Jewish refugees should take in this election. It is said that he has assured the Japanese that he will never hinder the Jewish people from being conservative and neutral or voting in favor of the Japanese in this election. Mr. Gomo believes that this is a natural phenomenon. Since Jewish refugees themselves have no representatives to wave their feet in the Municipal Council, they should maintain their neutral attitude and vote for the people they love according to their individual free will. They should never be bound by group behavior.</p>
<p>Eight Proposals of the Westerners' Annual Meeting</p>
<p>(1) Elect Judge Morasu as the chairman of the general meeting (proposed by Mr. Fanke Ling, seconded by Mr. Kai Ziwei). (2) Elect Mr. Naxi as the secretary of the general meeting, the same as above. (3) The agenda adopted at the previous general meeting should still be applicable in this meeting, the same as above. This proposal is published in the memorandum "Current Regulations of the Agenda", and each taxpayer can obtain a copy. (4) Elect Mr. Kelong as the annual real estate committee (proposed by Mr. Purson, seconded by Mr. Delok). (5) Elect four hospital administrators for the next year. (6) Report the report and accounts as of December 31 of last year (proposed by Mr. Fanke Ling, seconded by Mr. Kai Ziwei). (7) Support and approve the new budget for 1940 proposed by the previous board of directors. This budget, in accordance with past regulations, takes all income such as municipal council taxes as the standard and does not exceed 16,000,000 yuan (proposed by Mr. Fanke Ling, seconded by Mr. Kai Ziwei). (8) The new agenda rules recognized and adopted by this general meeting will remain effective until the next general meeting during the effective period (proposed by Mr. Fanke Ling, seconded by Mr. Kai Ziwei. The new agenda rules are published in the memorandum "New Parliamentary Regulations", and each taxpayer can obtain a copy).</p>
<p>Five Chinese Directors Recommended for Re-election</p>
<p>According to the amended Yangjingbang Regulations, the Public Concession Municipal Council has a fixed number of five Chinese directors, who are elected by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. On the side of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, they are elected by the General Assembly. There are currently a total of eighty-one representatives. Except for four deaths, there are actually seventy-seven representatives. Now, fifty-one, that is, the majority of representatives, have jointly proposed in writing that the Chinese directors and Chinese commissioners elected by the association are able to work hard and serve the taxpayers faithfully and are trusted and supported by the taxpayers for their opinions on municipal affairs and municipal reforms. Now that it is an extraordinary time, people only seek the old. All Chinese directors and commissioners who attended the Municipal Council from 1928 to 1929 are still recommended for re-election of the current Chinese directors and commissioners, so that they can be familiar with the work, further develop their talents, and contribute more to municipal affairs. After receiving the letter, the Taxpayers' Association believed that the official proposal of the majority of representatives should be respected. It will send a letter to the Municipal Council to check the re-election of the current Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu, and the Chinese commissioner Lin Kanghou.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Central Ministry of Social Affairs Comforts Shanghai Business Community, Committing to the Great Cause of Resistance and Construction From Beginning to End, Especially Hopeful for Unity to Strive for Final Victory <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Central Ministry of Social Affairs believes that the Shanghai business community is in a difficult environment, adhering to the spirit of loyalty and patriotism, which is commendable. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and all fellow guilds and all fellow citizens in the Shanghai business community, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the military and civilians across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, have risen up to serve their country. Our fellow citizens in the Shanghai business community have been committed to the great cause of resistance and national construction from beginning to end, in a position of heavy and dangerous obstacles, with a spirit of perseverance and courage, upholding justice and shining in all directions. All citizens of Shu express their respect. At a time when the Japanese are running out of tricks and trying to create pseudo-organizations to use Chinese to control Chinese, we especially hope for unity and struggle, to shatter slander and strive for final victory. This is what we deeply hope for. A special telegram of condolence. I hope you will understand. Printed by the Central Ministry of Social Affairs."</p>
<h3 id="e78">Western Newspapers Publish Insightful Comments <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Warning Western Expatriates to Rise Up and Defend Themselves</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Continental News editorial once again reminded Western expatriates, briefly saying, "The time is pressing. We should calmly consider the current situation. Western expatriates should know their predicament. This decision of the Japanese to cast votes in the election is entirely the result of taxpayers' lack of interest in the Municipal Council. According to the current situation, the five Japanese candidates can get more than 3,000 votes, while the eight candidates of other nationalities can only get 4,000. Both sides are working hard to win the votes of the other 1,000 people. Which side will win is still difficult to determine. The Japanese also have a great hope of winning. Here, in addition to the so-called 'national prejudice', there are also things that cannot be ignored, that is, the Municipal Council's economic situation is extremely depleted, and its political history is not optimistic. This time, the 50% increase in municipal donations is enough to cause dissatisfaction from all sides. If those who are completely based on the interests of the thousand people, they may vote in favor of the Japanese. In this case, it is not impossible for all Japanese candidates to be elected. If so, although future changes are difficult to predict, to put it bluntly, the Japanese will inevitably control the concession. The elected Japanese expatriates will directly receive training from the Tokyo military department and implement its 'New Order in East Asia'. Those who have experienced difficulties all understand what the so-called 'New Order in East Asia' is. It is nothing more than rejecting the third party's rights and interests in China. Therefore, the Japanese control of the concession is equivalent to the 'Japanization' of the concession."</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News Criticizes Reynolds</p>
<p>The American expatriate candidates were originally five, but Reynolds MacDonald announced himself as an independent candidate after failing to be elected. Yesterday, the English-language Great American Evening News expressed great dissatisfaction with this move, briefly saying, "We believe that the election of Reynolds MacDonald as an independent candidate is a mistake, which is harmful and useless. MacDonald's joining the election is just enough to divide the votes of the British and American expatriate candidates. At a time when the Japanese are eager to win the absolute majority of supporters, it gives the Japanese a good opportunity. Judging from MacDonald's failure to be elected, he participated in the primary election of British expatriate candidates and failed to be elected. This is enough to prove that he has few supporters in the British community. Now, even if he participates in the election again, he cannot gain the support of the public. We cannot believe that MacDonald's participation in the election violates any rules, but from a personal moral point of view, he should not have taken this action. If he gives the Japanese an opportunity to seize the power to govern the concession, then Mr. MacDonald must bear full responsibility."</p>

<p>According to people from Wuxi, Gu Fuxing, commander of the Second Guerrilla District of the 27th Group Army of the Third War Zone, who had been engaged in guerrilla warfare in the area of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road in Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou, was lured and arrested by the puppet Japanese military police captain Matsumoto in August last year and forced to surrender. Gu pretended to comply, accepted the puppet order, and took charge of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road defense. Now, in order to show his righteousness, Gu announced his revolt on the night of the 1st of this month in the southwest countryside of Wuxi. Pro-Li troops attacked the Japanese army on the nearby transportation lines. The Japanese army was caught off guard and more than 20 people were killed on the spot. The Japanese army mobilized reinforcements and began to engage in fierce battles in the suburbs of Wuxi. The visitor said that as of the morning of the 3rd of this month, two fierce battles had been launched. On the Nanjing-Shanghai Road, people's hearts were greatly stimulated, and puppet troops in various places showed signs of instability.</p>

<p>After the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was bombed by Japanese aircraft, it once stopped running passenger and freight trains. After the Railway Bureau tried its best to repair it, it resumed running ordinary passenger cars (that is, slow trains) on the 18th of this month and changed to running at night. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, none of the cars had sleeping car facilities, which was very inconvenient for travelers. Now, in order to facilitate travelers, the railway authorities have added a first-class sleeping car from March 5.</p>

The cash he carried slightly exceeded the limit. Because he did not complete the registration procedures, he was found by the customs at Hanoi Airport. After many explanations, he was exempted from confiscation and allowed to pass through. Later, he learned that if the amount is large, not only will it be confiscated, but also detention and punishment will be imposed.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Rice Merchant Association Suggests Measures to Curb Rice Hoarding: Rice Stored Before the End of January Must Be Sold Within Ten Days; Foreign Rice and Domestic Rice Must Be Subject to the Same Price Limits <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchant Association has submitted a proposal to the authorities of the British and French Concessions, stating that since the arrival of new indica rice has been abundant, sales have not been brisk, and the rice market situation has become increasingly chaotic. The price of indica rice has soared by as much as six or seven yuan per day, and the price of white rice on the black market has also risen in tandem with the price of indica rice. The reason for this is that speculative hoarders, taking advantage of their financial strength, have been hoarding large quantities of rice in various warehouses for months without selling. In addition, new hoarders are also actively buying up rice on the market to wait for a good price, which has greatly threatened the livelihoods of ordinary people. Those from poor families who rely on their daily labor to support their families are even less able to afford a measure of rice to satisfy their hunger. This situation is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Rice Price Increases Are All Man-Made</p>
<p>The market price is now being manipulated by speculators, while legitimate businesses that supply rice to retail stores are facing various obstacles in purchasing goods. The high price of rice, the increased cost, and the exploitation of the black market have made it difficult for businesses to operate. However, consumers are unaware of this and complain, causing rice merchants to suffer doubly. Getting by has become extremely difficult. This recent rise in rice prices is largely man-made. Green foreign rice and domestic rice are arriving continuously, and the warehouses are full of inventory, yet the price surge seems excessive. The underlying reason is that speculators are hoarding rice and refusing to sell, monopolizing the market to achieve their selfish desires.</p>
<p>Affects Livelihoods and Impairs Public Order</p>
<p>This behavior directly affects the livelihoods of ordinary people and indirectly impairs local public order. Hoarders and speculators should be strictly curbed. Therefore, we propose specific measures to allow the hoarded rice to circulate in the market, eliminate black market prices, and prevent speculative manipulators from monopolizing the market again. This will hopefully bring rice prices back to a reasonable level and gradually alleviate the suffering of ordinary people threatened by high rice prices. We respectfully request your approval and implementation of the following proposed measures:</p>
<p>Five Suggestions Requested for Adoption</p>
<p>(1) Investigate all indica and white rice stored in warehouses before the end of January of the 29th year. The two authorities should announce to all depositors that they must sell all of their rice within the specified time. Those who fail to comply within the deadline will be prosecuted in accordance with the "Regulations on the Prohibition of Hoarding Daily Necessities During the Emergency Period" promulgated by the Chongqing National Government and fined four yuan per bag (national currency) as a warning. (2) The two authorities should notify all warehouses that they are absolutely not allowed to transfer ownership or move rice between warehouses to prevent concealment or trickery. (3) The two authorities should announce regulations for the maximum storage period of indica and white rice in warehouses, which should not exceed two months. After two months, each warehouse must report the names of the owners and the warehouse receipt numbers to the two authorities for verification. (4) If indica and white rice stored in warehouses is not sold after the two-month deadline, the two authorities may handle the matter in accordance with the provisions of item (1) of the same article. (5) Foreign rice and domestic rice should be subject to the same price limits.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Negotiations on Fair-Priced Flour Have Not Been Resolved <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Factories Insist on High Costs; Authorities Continue to Negotiate Without Success</p>
<p>Since the supply of fair-priced flour was discontinued last month, the noodle, steamed bun, pancake, and other industries in this city have faced high prices for recycled flour and scarce market supplies. The price of flour-based foods is set to rise, severely impacting the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, these industries have successively requested the Municipal Council to negotiate with the factories to continue providing fair-priced flour. The Municipal Council has held five or six rounds of negotiations with the factories, but no resolution has been reached because the factories insist that the cost is above 13 yuan per bag. The Municipal Council's response to the noodle industry's request, originally scheduled for the day before yesterday, has also been delayed. Although the supply of recycled flour on the market has recently become more abundant due to speculative hoarders dumping their stock, and the price has fallen to just over 13.3 yuan, it has not been able to suppress the price of flour-based foods. The severity of the food situation for the people has not been alleviated. Therefore, these industries are eagerly hoping that the factories can make some concessions or that those who are enthusiastic about society can find other ways to sell flour at a fair price to alleviate the suffering of ordinary people.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Drivers Demand Increased Liquor Allowance: Final Stage <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations Yesterday Still Far Apart; Labor Side Sets Three-Day Deadline for Reply</p>
<p>The labor and management sides of the Xiang Sheng, Tailai, Yunfei, and Yinse (Silver) four major taxi companies in this city, regarding the drivers' demand for increased liquor allowances, each sent representatives at 5:00 PM yesterday to conduct a third round of negotiations in the screening room of the Da Guangming Cinema on Nanjing Road. The meeting ended at 8:30 PM without a satisfactory resolution. According to a Ping Ming News Agency reporter's inquiries, although both sides were extremely sincere in yesterday's negotiations, the management still insisted on providing additional subsidies instead of increasing the liquor allowance, so their views could not be reconciled. According to the labor side, the subsidies are very limited, and adding or not adding them makes little difference. Only increasing the liquor allowance can solve the drivers' livelihood problems. According to the Xiang Sheng, Yunfei, and Yinse companies' management, they were initially willing to accept the increase in the liquor allowance, but the Tailai company's management insisted on subsidies, and the negotiations ultimately failed. The labor side is still working as usual, waiting for a satisfactory resolution. However, with the livelihood of their families at stake and the long delay, it is not a solution in the end. Therefore, they declared yesterday that they would give the management three days to reply, otherwise, they may take further action.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Continuation of Fair-Priced Rice Issue: Consultation Tomorrow <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>No Decision at Last Meeting</p>
<p>The Fair-Priced Rice Committee in this city did not make any decision on whether to continue the fair-priced rice program after the third phase, which ended on the 7th of this month. Therefore, they will reconvene at 3:00 PM tomorrow at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road for a meeting. The proposal by the Bean and Rice Trade Association to use the remaining 100,000+ yuan (national currency) previously donated to fund another fair-priced rice program will be one of the important topics of discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Speculators Shift Their Target: Cotton Yarn Market Soars <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Result Will Leave Ordinary People Naked and Severely Impact Cotton Yarn Trade</p>
<p>According to Da Zhong News Agency, the cotton yarn market has been soaring recently, without any standards. Even using US dollars for settlement, it is more expensive than before the war. For example, 20-count Jin Cheng yarn, before the war, each package (about 400-420 pounds) cost no more than 275 yuan. In the cheapest time, in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was only 190 yuan. Recently, it has soared to a huge 1,120 yuan. 32-count Jin Cheng yarn, the lowest price before the war (24th year of the Republic of China) was 236 yuan, now it is as high as over 1,500 yuan. 42-count yarn, the lowest price before the war was 290 yuan, now it is approaching the 1,600 yuan mark. According to an investigation by a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency, the dramatic rise in yarn prices is due to the manipulation of speculators, and the long-term cause is related to the recent situation of excessive foreign demand. Since the August 13th Incident, the yarn factories in the war zone have been destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in heavy losses, and the domestic cotton yarn production has been greatly affected. Recently, the exchange rate of our country's currency has fallen, which is very conducive to export trade. Therefore, the export of cotton yarn from this port has increased greatly compared with before the war. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the export of cotton yarn was 33,345 metric tons, valued at 4,167,320 yuan. Last year, the export of cotton yarn was 116,022 metric tons, valued at 31,148,990 yuan, about three times that of before the war. Although the domestic entrepot trade has decreased compared with before the war, it has also made progress recently. For example, the total amount of cotton yarn shipped from Shanghai to various ports in China was 640,000 metric tons in the year before last, and about 600,000 metric tons last year. Since the outbreak of the European War, British cotton yarn cloth cannot be sold well in the Far East, and the yarn industry in this port has even greater hope. Generally, speculators, afraid of being sanctioned by the concession authorities for manipulating rice, have shifted their attention to the yarn market. If the recent surge in yarn prices continues unabated, it will inevitably hit the domestic and foreign trade of cotton yarn. The Nanyang market will be occupied by Japanese goods, and the domestic sales in the Southwest will also allow Burma and India to take the lead. Recently, because the government has banned the import of goods from the occupied areas into the mainland, a large number of goods from India and Burma have been imported into the Southwest. The result of market speculation is that on the one hand, it can make the common people naked, and on the other hand, it can hit foreign trade. It harms both the people and the merchants, causing great harm.</p>

<p>According to Ping Ming News Agency, the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, in order to benefit the common people, its member manufacturers will provide 1,000 loads of coal briquettes daily and sell them at a fair price in 27 locations throughout the city. The period is from March 2nd to the 21st, which has already expired. Now, the association has decided to continue to handle it according to the previously determined method from the 22nd. As for the price of coal briquettes, from the 22nd of this month, it will be temporarily changed to 120 yuan per ton for the factory price (the previous price was only limited to wholesale within the industry), and the selling price per ton for users will also be the same. The door-to-door selling price is 6 yuan and 4 jiao per 100 catties, and another 2 jiao will be added for delivery, totaling 6 yuan and 6 jiao per 100 catties. As for the second phase of fair-priced sales, it will expire today. Whether or not to continue to hold it in the future, the association specially convened a meeting of representatives of various manufacturers at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Coal Industry Building on Tianjin Road to discuss this issue. The meeting was chaired by Chen Cuifang, and representatives from 23 manufacturers, including Yi Taixing, Dongfang, and Guohua, attended. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to continue the fair-priced sales for ten days from April 11th to the 20th. It is stipulated that each person can only buy 3 jiao each time, which is 5.5 catties of coal briquettes. The total number of fair-priced sales is still 10,350 loads. Because the fair-priced sales locations may be changed, it will be temporarily suspended for a few days. Once the locations are designated, they will be announced.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Japanese Army Shelters: Organization Plans to Sell Red Pills: Koreans Oversee the Matter; Poison Spreads in Concessions <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to the Da Zhong News Agency, according to a report received yesterday, under the protection of the Japanese army, red pills are continuously transported into the concessions, and the number of red pill users has increased dramatically. The harm is ten times greater than that of opium and heroin. After the price of opium rose from seven yuan an ounce to forty yuan an ounce, most users could not afford it, and the cost of heroin was even higher than that of opium, so the number of users also decreased. As a result, the red pill business has flourished. Chinese men and women, and even children, are being sent to hospitals for treatment due to addiction. According to reliable sources, those who sell red pills and smuggle them into the concessions have a licensed company organization. The company pays taxes to the Japanese army daily as the price of protection. It is also reported that a large red pill company specializing in selling red pills to North China and selling them in Shanghai has been established under the direction of the Japanese. Two companies specializing in heroin, organized by Koreans, have also appeared. They are transferred from Tianjin to Shanghai and are also protected by the Japanese. The Japanese are sparing no effort to protect this business, which can make huge profits, but they are cautious in their actions, so that foreigners cannot obtain evidence. The Public Concession Police Department said that it is willing to do its best to curb it, but the number of red pill smugglers captured by the concession authorities is very small. It is said that the Police Department has already captured nine Koreans and obtained evidence that the Japanese are involved.</p>

<p>Two well-dressed travelers arrived at the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Wood Bridge in the French Concession at about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. After entering, they were led to room 600 on the sixth floor by a tea server. Nothing unusual happened in the evening. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 AM yesterday, a tea server named Jia planned to go in and clean up. He knocked on the door, but there was no response. So he opened the door and entered, but the bed was empty. He was very surprised. When he turned into the inner room, the bathroom, he was shocked to find a corpse. He looked at it and it was the traveler who had opened the room. He cried out in alarm and the accountant urgently reported to the French Police Department, which sent officers to inspect. It was found that the traveler had been strangled to death with a belt. The traveler had registered as Li Chenghang, a local, 33 years old, but it is not known whether this is the real name of the deceased. It was also heard that a "Peace and Save the Country Army" symbol and a Zhu Ying business card were found near the body. The Police Department is investigating the case. Also, it was reported that on the 4th at 7:00 AM, the French Police Department received a report that the traveler in room 602 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Wood Bridge had died. The Police Department personnel found that the deceased was named Zhu Ying, unemployed, about 40 years old, wearing ordinary clothes, lying on the floor, and had been strangled to death with a cloth strip. Only one yuan of French currency was found in his pocket. The body was cold, indicating that he had been strangled to death at night. The Police Department is investigating the case.</p>

He reported to the Police Department and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene of the accident to investigate. The corpse of Cai Xiaomei was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the Police Department sent Yan Maoyin to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer for the Police Department, stated that the defendant was driving too fast at the time, reaching 30 horsepower, and the parts of the car were damaged and unresponsive, resulting in this disaster. The Police Department prosecuted him for manslaughter under the criminal law and requested detention. The family members of the victim were unable to attend court at the coroner's office. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. Judge Xiao Peishen still ordered him to be detained and rescheduled for further review.</p>

Blood flowed all over the ground, and she lost consciousness. She was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by ambulance, and her life is in danger.</p>

<p>Lao Zhengxing Restaurant at No. 271-273 Jiujian Road (east end of Shandong Road) in the Public Concession has been open for many years and has a small reputation. The manager is Cao Jinquan, a local, over 50 years old. The business is usually booming. Unexpectedly, at more than 3:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out, spreading to the handrails, which led to the point of no return. Three apprentices, Tang A'er, 17 years old, his brother A'er, 13 years old, and Li A'er, 16 years old, all from Wuxi, were unable to escape and were burned to death. The rest of the staff were unable to escape down the stairs and jumped out of the windows to escape, all suffering serious injuries.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing showed no increase or decrease. The black market for British and American exchange rates was hovering, and there was no color. The operators lacked interest. At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate between the US and the UK rose slightly by one-twelfth of a cent, causing the British to be flat and the US to be tight. Later, foreign firms offered good intentions. Although speculative merchants collected in the market, the positions were still balanced and extremely stable. After that, Hong Kong suddenly entrusted a certain Chinese firm to spit it out, followed by speculative merchants selling. The price could not be supported, and the US exchange rate was 6.125 yuan. Until 10:30, the transaction in the market decreased considerably, and the market was very sluggish. Until the close of noon, there was no change. The afternoon situation remained the same. Halfway through, foreign firms came in and out slightly, but the prices were the same. At the close, the British gold was still 4.125 yuan, and the US exchange rate was 6.125 yuan (equivalent to the US-British exchange rate of 1.56375 yuan), with no glory or disgrace compared to the previous close. The futures market slightly loosened, and the spot market was slightly strained.</p>

The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices: British gold at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and US dollars at 6.09375 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was flat, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125, due to the further drop in exchange rates. Simultaneously, futures opened with the British pound flat and the US dollar weaker by 0.03125. After the opening, foreign merchants showed considerable selling interest. Although speculators absorbed some, the market was particularly stable. It is estimated that foreign firms sold US dollars for this month at 5.9375 yuan to speculators. The HSBC listed price was announced unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced at a high of 0.75. Afterwards, a certain Chinese bank suddenly sold on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and a small number of speculators followed suit, causing the market to loosen slightly. It is estimated that Hong Kong banks sold British gold for this month at 4 shillings and 0.046875 pence to Wing On Bank, and also sold US dollars for this month at 5.96875 yuan and 6 yuan to foreign firms. At the same time, Chinese merchants also sold US dollars for this month at 6 yuan, and US dollars for May at 5.84375 yuan to foreign firms. At this time, the spot US dollar also rebounded to 6.125 yuan. After 10:30, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and transactions were scarce, resulting in a particularly sluggish situation. Until the close, there was no activity. British gold remained at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and the US dollar at 6.125 yuan, compared to the morning opening, the British pound was flat, and the US dollar rebounded by 0.03125. Futures: the British pound rose by 0.015625, and the US dollar loosened by 0.0625.</p>
<p>British and American Futures Continue to Rise</p>
<p>The after-market was particularly calm, with very few transactions. It was rumored that HSBC sold spot British gold at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence to foreign firms, and speculators sold Shanghai US dollars for this month at 6.03125 yuan to Chinese banks. As a result, spot British gold was at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and US dollars at 6.125 yuan. British gold for this month was at 4 shillings and 0.046875 pence, and US dollars at 6 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds initially stable, but then, due to the decline in gold prices and abundant supply from various sources, market prices trended towards weakness again. There was some demand for British gold notes among dealers, and market prices showed strength. Initially, due to the decline in pound prices, there was strong buying interest for US dollar notes, and prices rose slightly to 16.323 yuan in the early morning. Subsequently, they rose further to 16.38 yuan. Later, Hong Kong dispatches suddenly began to dump US dollars, causing the market atmosphere to weaken again. At noon, prices retreated to 16.25 yuan. Selling pressure did not decrease in the afternoon, and evening prices fell to 16.21 yuan. Supply and demand for Hong Kong notes were balanced, and market prices remained stable. After consecutive days of increases, Dutch notes softened immediately upon encountering a slight increase in supply. There was also a large supply of Philippine notes. Remnants of Japanese notes have begun to return, likely due to dumping by securities firms. The evening price was 1.314 yuan. Korean notes maintained their upward trend, with the evening price at 1.05 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds decrease by 50 cents, British gold notes increase by 5 cents, US dollar notes decrease by 9 cents, Dutch notes decrease by 10 cents, Philippine notes decrease by 5 cents, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Gold Released; Securities Firms the Most Active Sellers <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for spot gold saw a lack of buying and selling interest among operators, and the market ultimately weakened after fluctuating. Initially, due to the further decline in exchange rates, the US dollar was slightly tighter, and the opening price rose to 5,500 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange frequently purchased, so the price once reached a high of 5,515 yuan. However, shortly after, it was rumored that foreign exchange had leveled off, and futures had hardened instead, causing the market to suddenly change. Cash houses took the lead in selling, and a certain securities firm also came to dump, causing market prices to weaken, immediately dropping to 5,477 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange resumed purchasing, still managing to reach a high of 5,495 yuan. However, after 11 o'clock, buyers disappeared, and sellers flocked, with securities firms having the greatest impact. The noon close was only 5,463 yuan. The afternoon situation was calmer than before. Prices briefly increased due to sudden scavenging by banks, but the downward trend was difficult to reverse due to the continued release by securities firms. The evening close had retreated to a low price of 5,460 yuan. Total daily trading decreased compared to before, by about 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed at a minor 5 yuan at noon. Customs gold and other types remained flat.</p>
<p>Very Few Buyers Active</p>
<p>Since morning, the initial report of contracting exchange rates and slightly tighter US dollars per bar (ten taels) caused nervousness, leading to an initial increase of 17 yuan. A securities firm released twenty taels to a bank at 5,500 yuan. Shortly after, a cash house released ten taels to a bank at 5,495 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange showed strong buying appetite, and retail investors followed suit, causing another increase of twenty yuan. A certain money exchange purchased twenty taels from a gold shop at 5,515 yuan. After this, foreign exchange futures loosened, and a certain cash house vigorously sold at a lower price, while buyers ceased activity, leading to a slow decline. Soon after, spot US dollars were also reported to be hardening, and sellers increased. A certain securities firm dumped a significant amount. The money exchange sold twenty taels to a bank, but only at 5,477 yuan. Later, the money exchange resumed scavenging, and at that time, gold shops also bought in, raising the price again by eighteen yuan. A bank sold thirty taels to a money exchange at 5,495 yuan. After 11 o'clock, cash houses and a certain securities firm resumed selling, and retail investors also painfully liquidated their positions, but buyers had little appetite and were unable to support the market, leading to a decrease of thirty-three yuan. A gold shop sold twenty taels to a bank at 5,462 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm sold thirty taels to a gold shop at 5,463 yuan, marking the noon closing price. The afternoon opening price decreased by a minor three yuan. A money exchange sold twenty taels to a securities firm at 5,460 yuan. Later, due to scavenging by money exchanges and banks, the price increased by twelve yuan. A money exchange sold ten taels to a bank at 5,472 yuan. Ultimately, due to dumping by a certain securities firm and a certain money exchange, although another securities firm had come to absorb, the position was still felt to be full, decreasing by a minor twelve yuan. A gold shop sold fifty taels to a jewelry dealer at 5,460 yuan, marking the evening closing price. As a result, it decreased by another twenty-three yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of fifty-five yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash houses for their own brand of gold was several yuan higher than spot gold, while the purchase price was twenty yuan lower. The current standard gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, with very few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Also Decreases by a Minor Five Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, major jewelry stores were still exchanging jewelry gold at 555 yuan per tael. By 12 o'clock, it decreased by a minor five yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, major stores changed the listing to 550 yuan, with new stores having the same price as the previous one. The purchase price decreased by around fifteen yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts first fell and then rose. In the morning, it decreased from 65 yuan to 64 yuan per thousand, and in the afternoon, it suddenly rose to 68 yuan, an increase of two yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Trade Association continued to rise, with both the morning and afternoon markets listing it higher at 22 cents, an increase of two cents compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>The securities black market saw a gradual increase in bullish sentiment yesterday, with short covering becoming increasingly urgent, especially in the afternoon. There was ample exchange draft liquidity, and the financial community was gradually showing interest in this. Class C shares even broke through the 50 yuan mark, Class B shares also reached 51 yuan, and West shares also exceeded 9 yuan. The positive situation was the best seen in months. Speculators' attention was gradually shifting, and the market sentiment was good. The prospects were positive and not yet exhausted. Yesterday's performance remained tight and stable in the morning, with only a few short coverings. Most transactions were still limited to mutual exchanges. Short covering surged in the afternoon, with Lien Ho being the most active, and demand for Class C shares being particularly strong. Yong Kang numbers 14, 20, and 64 also had considerable demand. Other companies such as Tong Ji, De Fu, Tong Kang, Run Heng, and Tong Shun all saw buying interest. The market was filled with buying pressure, and although Lien Yi, Hong Kang, Yi Tai, and Jiu Feng successively supplied shares, this was not enough to counter the bullish force. The market became increasingly firm, and all saw new high prices for the year. Overall, the results were good, increasing by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, with a total transaction volume of around 2 million. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions saw a large transaction of 50 shares of the Lun Chuan Company, priced at 47.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The public market of the Chamber of Commerce had no special features, with most transactions limited to squaring accounts between bulls and bears, likely due to the approaching weekend. As a result, prices fluctuated and slightly decreased, with rubber stocks feeling the same.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debts slightly increased. The Northern Ning Railroad Bond surged 3 pounds, to a price of 60 pounds. The Sino-French US dollar bond and the Vickers Aviation Bond each rose by 0.5 pounds, with the former at 52 pounds and the latter at 11 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. There was some interest in Anglo-French Reconstruction and Sino-French US dollars in this city. The buying price for Anglo-French Reconstruction was 37 pounds, and the selling price was 38 pounds. The buying price for Sino-French US dollars was 48 pounds, and the selling price was 52.5 pounds.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for British Far Eastern companies' stocks saw a slight increase in bank stocks. The Mercantile Bank of India stock rose 2 shillings and 6 pence, to a price of 9 pounds and 7 shillings and 6 pence. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British-registered stock rose by 0.5 pounds, to a price of 94 pounds. The Hong Kong-registered stock remained willing to trade, and the rest were unremarkable.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Grains: Rice Market's Sharp Momentum Will Fade <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Since the rice market turned weak, it continued to show softness yesterday. The market was sluggish from morning to noon. Although there is no confirmed evidence of the imminent clearing of domestic rice sources, many minds are already worried. Domestic shops, in addition to making some small purchases for urgent needs, have no intention of stocking up. Customers from inland provinces have also stopped trading. Although original customers and vendors are not willing to easily sell due to the price decline, floating speculators are afraid of repeating the disastrous fall and are still dumping various types of foreign rice at low prices, causing prices to fall by 50 or 60 cents to around one yuan. The closing prices are estimated to be 43 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 28.7 yuan for No. 2, 42 yuan for "Fire Twist," 38.5 yuan for No. 2 Siam, 38.2 or 3 yuan for "Small Twist," 40.05 yuan for Tokyo Top Grade, dropping to 39 yuan for the next grade, 35.5 yuan for mixed broken rice, dropping to 34 yuan for the next grade.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice's path is stagnant and further impacted by Tianjin rice, with prices also decreasing by around 50 cents. Top grade is now only 37 yuan, and the next grade is only 35 yuan. Domestic rice, such as thick and thin "Jing," early and late rice, is also weak. It is heard that outside the market, black market transactions are rare, and prices have depreciated by nearly one yuan. Kunshan "Jing" is 44.5 yuan or 44 yuan, top grade "Bo Dao" is 43 or 4 yuan, and early rice is 41 yuan.</p>
<p>1,227 bags of foreign rice, transported by Taikoo Company's Xinjiang from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai around 4 PM yesterday and are scheduled to be unloaded onto the wharf starting this morning. (Zu)</p>
<p>In the morning, foreign rice continued the previous day's decline, with all grades trending downwards. Although fixed orders have not been cleared, the previous orders are still arriving successively. Furthermore, the rumor of the smooth transport of inland "Jing" rice has further dampened sentiment. Foreign rice is currently down by a minor 50 or 60 cents to over one yuan. The futures price for No. 2 Saigon in April opened at 49 yuan and then dropped to 48.7 yuan. Same-day delivery ranged from 48.5 yuan to 48.2 yuan, and "Small Twist" was 47.5 yuan. However, sellers were reluctant to sell further after the price decreased. In the afternoon, selling pressure subsided, and prices for No. 4 and No. 5 No. 2 Saigon partially rebounded to 49 yuan. The total trading volume for opened and closed futures was 300 to 400 tons, and 5,000 bags of spot rice.</p>

<p>Transactions in the flour market continued to show moderate activity yesterday, but there was no large-scale clearance. Recently, the supply of domestic miscellaneous brand flour has gradually increased in the market, such as Double Lion and Mountain Deer brands, which are quite popular among a segment of customers. It is heard that Double Lion brand has reached 13.35 yuan, and Mountain Deer brand has also risen to over 13 yuan, with 2,000 to 3,000 bags being traded. It is also heard that North Ocean group has shipped several grades of flour, including 2,000 bags of Paotai brand foreign flour, priced at 14.3 yuan. The factory price for the old Che brand, which should be sold on this street, is fixed at 13.8 yuan. Due to the decline in rice prices, re-imported goods are priced slightly lower than the factory price.</p>
<p>Transactions in the wheat market remained quiet yesterday. Customers and Japanese factories have not been actively trading for a long time. Chinese factories, on the other hand, are only making sporadic purchases of previously fixed foreign wheat that has arrived at the port. The total market continues to offer around 1,000 bags of Changsu and other wheat, and there have been no special changes in sales.</p>

<p>The bituminous coal business is still quite good, with both factories and trading firms having demand. Customer sales are also slightly more active than before, so the market remains stable. Selling prices are also not weak. Recently, a certain firm has received over 2,500 tons of new Borneo bituminous coal, which has already been unloaded onto the wharf. Traders are asking for a higher price than Indian coal, with lump coal priced at 225 yuan per ton for cash transactions, ex-wharf.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Cotton Yarn: Opening Forward Cotton Yarn; Purchasing Raw Cotton; Huge Profits Can Be Made Per Bale <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in domestic cotton are very scarce, while transactions in foreign cotton are very active. Sentiment has become slightly firmer due to the slight increase in cotton prices, but it is still not as enthusiastic as the yarn market. 573 bales of Tongzhou cotton from the Jiangsu north source have arrived. The current cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Middling Two Seven Seven Point Five Tian: Trading Firms Purchase 244 Bales</p>
<p>Also: Two Seven Five Point Zero Zero Again: 150 Bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton Two Zero Seven Point Two Five Again: 150 Bales</p>
<p>Middling Two Seven Five Point Zero Zero Again: 1,100 Bales</p>
<p>Also: Two Seven Six Point Five Zero Again: 1,100 Bales</p>
<p>Also: Two Seven Three Point Zero Zero Again: 100 Bales</p>
<p>Another report: The market price for foreign cotton in New York opened higher due to speculative buying and then rose further due to buying on Wall Street and by the general public. As a result, closing prices rose by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton was firmer, rising by two rupees including the forecast. Egyptian cotton rose by ten pounds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the rise in yarn prices in Shanghai, factories purchased raw cotton and simultaneously opened forward cotton yarn, making huge profits per bale. Therefore, there were some fixed orders for Indian cotton, amounting to 2,000. Japanese yarn factories have also begun to place orders continuously, mostly for West Indian cotton, all for shipments in May. The factory prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.0625 yuan per US dollar, are as follows:</p>
<p>20 Count: American Middling: 286.50</p>
<p>20 Count: Again: Lower Grade: 275.40</p>
<p>32 Count: Again: 302.50</p>
<p>32 Count: Again: Lower Grade: 292.60</p>
<p>42 Count: Again: 305.90</p>
<p>42 Count: Again: Lower Grade: 295.80</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 7,200 bales of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai on the British Company's Su Ri Maru mail ship from Mumbai and docked at the Pu Chang Line at around 7 AM for unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Cotton Yarn Buying Interest Overflowing; Rumors of a Notice in the Market Banning Forward Trading <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been fluctuating in the previous day, rose wildly again yesterday. Raw materials remained flat, the US dollar increased, and gold loosened, but sentiment in the cotton yarn market remained enthusiastic. This is because spot sales are good, and purchasing from the Southwest is constant. The inventory of 20-count Double Horse yarn is low, so although raw cotton is weak, the foundation of the yarn market is still solid. The spot price for 20-count Emaciated Horse yarn is 1,160 yuan. The high advance price for April is 1,180 yuan. The closing price is 1,172 yuan. Shen Xin Factory opened 500 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at a cash price of 1,120 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening for forward yarn saw buying interest overflowing due to nervous sentiment and good spot business the previous afternoon. The April price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,150 yuan, jumping 10 yuan to 63 or 4 yuan. Short covering followed, and high prices were seen at 1,180 yuan. Halfway through, it was heard that the market notice stated that forward trading was not legal and would be banned in the future, causing bulls to sell off slightly, pulling the closing price down to 1,170 yuan. The total transaction volume in the first half of the day was 1,835 bales. The market price for 20-count Double Horse spot yarn rose by 39 yuan. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Trading Firms 1,305 Hong Kong 415</p>
<p>Inland 20 Xiamen 15</p>
<p>Tianjin 50 Fuzhou 30</p>
<p>Total: 1,835</p>

<p>Domestic Cloth: Cloth prices rose sharply yesterday as both insiders and outsiders scrambled to open forward trades, not deterred by high prices, causing selling prices to climb to the peak. Factory prices for high-quality fine cloth are now set at 25 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fabrics such as fine cloth and twill also rose by over 50 cents. Coarse cloth and car canvas were relatively popular, with 14 and 16 pound fabrics rising by 50 cents and lightweight fabrics rising by 10 or 20 cents. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by 50 cents to 1 yuan. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou trading firms purchased over 800 pieces of coarse and fine cloth. Over 1,000 pieces of grey cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were traded on this street. Guangdong trading firms purchased over 100 pieces of reed cloth. The current high price of cloth is equal to and even higher than the price of silk in previous years, making clothing a major problem.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to strong buying appetite among trading firms and outside groups, the price of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill continued to rise. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 32.65 yuan per bolt, a sharp increase of around 90 cents. The price for this month's forward was 33 yuan, and the price for next month's forward was 34 yuan. Foreign firms were asking even higher prices, with the May price for Dragon Head opening at 34 yuan and rising to 34.5 yuan. Medium-grade Caiqiu and other brands also required 33.75 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge had the highest price on the market, with the spot price reaching 99 cents per yard at the closing, decreasing back to 98.5 cents.</p>

<p>There is currently a very large stock of shelled peanuts in the Shanghai market. Insiders estimate that there are over 30,000 bags, but actual sales are very slow, making it difficult to boost sentiment. The market atmosphere is quite bleak. Yesterday, Hong Kong trading firms purchased over 1,000 bags of Qingdao shelled peanuts at 32 yuan, a further decline of one yuan compared to the previous market. There were also 50 tons of beans transported to Singapore. (Yu)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment in the oil market was influenced by two factors: first, the market (and miscellaneous grains market) is closed for three days (including Sunday) for the traditional Qingming Festival; and second, rumors of bullish news filled the air, making trading among trading firms more lively. As a result, soybean oil rebounded to 1 yuan, but peanut oil exporters remained unmoved. Moreover, due to large stockpiles, it was difficult to rally, and prices fell by over one yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, New York silk prices rose slightly for near and distant futures, but Yokohama prices fell again in the afternoon. However, yesterday's silk market in Shanghai saw slightly increased trading. White mills and silk manufacturers sold 50 bales of Shandong silk, with both coarse and fine patterns. Jardine Matheson imported 50 bales of silk. Indian silk transactions amounted to 20 bales in the afternoon. The price of silk fell by 50 to 150 yuan. It is predicted that the silk market is more likely to trend downwards.</p>
<p>1,119 boxes of rayon, transported by the Italian mail ship Conte Verde from Italy, arrived at the port at noon yesterday and docked at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading. Another 130 boxes of rayon, transported from Hong Kong by the Xinjiang arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It is heard that it is Dongtai (Year).</p>

<p>Lawsuit Over a Dog's Life</p>
<p>In the foreign concessions of this port, since the English Municipal Council issued a notice about killing dogs, and the French Municipal Council established regulations for poisoning dogs, most of the famous dogs have suffered terribly. Although they have the spirit of welcoming guests and the speed of delivering messages, once captured, they are immediately executed. Their owners swallow their anger and dare not complain. Alas! The power and influence of the Westerners is truly so scorching hot. However, following the gentlemanly way of measuring others by one's own standards, one might say that dogs are indeed annoying creatures, and efforts should be made to eliminate all dogs, whether produced by the Chinese or the Westerners, to rid the world of dogs entirely. Only then would it be considered fair. But what I heard yesterday is quite strange! The Victoria Public Gardens in the concessions are, of course, established by Westerners. They kept a foreign dog, which bit a cooper named Wang Rong, who then beat it to death. The Westerners immediately called for the arrest of Wang Rong and handed him over to the Mixed Court, claiming that the dog was worth fifty silver dollars. Wang Rong pleaded that he was poor and unable to pay compensation, begging for leniency. Magistrate Chen then ordered him to be detained as a warning. Alas! Dogs also have their fortunes and misfortunes.</p>
<p>Ghosts</p>
<p>A house belonging to a certain family on Suchow Creek Street has been closed for many years, and it is rumored that ghosts haunt the premises, so few people dare to live there. At the beginning of this month, a certain Jia from Jinling rented the house. The landlord offered it at a low price, and Jia moved his family into the house. That very night, he sat alone with a candle, intending to witness any strange occurrences. After midnight, he saw an old man leaning on a staff entering the room from outside the window. The old man bowed deeply towards the large lit candle, and the candlelight flickered suddenly, dimming like a bean, and then went out. Afterwards, the old man held a ball, its eerie glow illuminating his beard and eyebrows, and seemed about to pounce. Jia tried to shout, but his mouth was unable to utter a sound. He fell over backwards. His family heard the noise and wanted to come out to check, but they circled the room and could not find the door. By dawn, things had calmed down, and Jia gradually regained consciousness.</p>

<p>Children's Reading Material</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Suggestion <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>Mr. Dao Hong earnestly "hopes that the writing and publishing circles of Shanghai will shift some of their attention to children's reading material, to create some blessings for our suffering children." I, in addition to agreeing and responding, will add a little "contribution."</p>
<p>Children's reading material is the most important teaching tool, a collection point for learning materials, and a tool for families to use to train children in their studies. However, the value of reading material lies not only in making children memorize its content, but in its ability to gradually and imperceptibly help children expand their thinking, organize their thoughts, transform their thinking, and enable children to change their actual behavior to adapt to the environment of social life.</p>
<p>The first section of the Elementary School Curriculum Standard, "General Goals of Elementary School Education," states: "Elementary school education should be based on the Three Principles of the People, and in accordance with the educational purpose and implementation guidelines of the Republic of China, develop children's physical and mental health, cultivate the basic knowledge and skills necessary for national morality and life, in order to cultivate citizens who know propriety, righteousness, love their country, and love their community." Therefore, children's reading material should:</p>
<p>Cultivate children's healthy bodies</p>
<p>Cultivate children's good character</p>
<p>Develop children's interest in beauty</p>
<p>Enhance children's knowledge and skills for life</p>
<p>Train children's labor habits</p>
<p>Cultivate children's concepts of loving their country and community</p>
<p>Cultivate children's spirit of mutual assistance and unity</p>
<p>Elementary school children's reading material is generally divided into two major categories: in-class and out-of-class. In-class reading material for elementary school students is nothing more than textbooks, so I will not discuss them here. Now let's talk about out-of-class reading material:</p>
<p>(A) Standards for Reading Material Content:</p>
<p>(1) Must be necessary for children's real life.</p>
<p>(2) Must be necessary for modern social life.</p>
<p>(3) Must be able to develop children's thinking.</p>
<p>(4) Must be able to stimulate children's creativity.</p>
<p>(5) Must be able to increase children's research interest.</p>
<p>(6) Must enable children to understand and enjoy.</p>
<p>(7) Must be based on children's life experiences and environment.</p>
<p>(8) Must be suitable for children's psychological and physiological development processes.</p>
<p>(9) Must have a transformative function and can enhance children's ability to adapt to life.</p>
<p>(10) Must be vivid, interesting, and not contrary to natural phenomena.</p>
<p>(11) Must indicate the trend of evolution and encourage children to strive.</p>
<p>(12) Must have room for flexibility to adapt to individual needs.</p>
<p>(B) Arrangement of Reading Material:</p>
<p>(1) Use psychological arrangement as much as possible—a method of arrangement that satisfies children's needs based on their psychology.</p>
<p>(2) From concrete to abstract—because concrete materials are easier to understand than abstract ones.</p>

<p>(1) Printing should be clear.</p>
<p>(2) Paper should be white.</p>
<p>(3) Font should be large, and the number of words in each row should not be excessive.</p>
<p>(4) There should be an appropriate distance between words and between lines.</p>
<p>(5) There should be many illustrations, and the images should be drawn accurately.</p>
<p>(6) Punctuation should be clear.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Still Needs Effort <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>In the "Chunqiu" [Annals] column on April 1, I read Mr. Dao Hong's article "Where Are Our Children's Reading Materials?" The words were earnest and profound, and I was filled with admiration. I also deeply feel that there are indeed too few children's reading materials in Shanghai at present, which is not enough for children's spiritual nourishment. However, the degree of panic about children's reading material has not yet reached the point of "there is not only not a single real children's reading material at present, but even the people who advocate it are gone." Now I will report to readers what I know about excellent children's reading materials and the publication news of children's reading materials.</p>
<p>Regarding periodicals for children's reading, there were indeed many before the war, and most of them were published by major bookstores. After the war, these periodicals were successively discontinued, and there was a period of silence. However, later, Shanghai Children, New Children, Little Master, Chinese Children, and Juvenile Current Affairs Reader, etc. were published successively, totaling more than a dozen kinds. However, most of them were founded by the efforts of a few people, and the manpower and financial resources were insufficient. But in this time and place, it is not easy. Moreover, at that time, major newspapers, such as *Shen Bao*, *Xinwen Bao*, *Xinwen Evening News*, *Wenhui Bao*, *Da Wan Bao*, *Zhongmei Daily*, etc., also had children's weekly magazines. When the European War broke out, foreign exchange shrank drastically, and paper prices soared, so due to the weakness of economic power, periodicals were discontinued one after another, and children's supplements in newspapers also reduced their space, and even disappeared. This has to be said to be a great predicament for children's reading material. Up to now, only New Children and Little Master are still published as usual, maintaining their inherent style and attitude, and others have completely disappeared. It is said that the Shidai Publishing House will soon publish a children's monthly magazine, and it will soon be available to readers. These periodicals have a pure stance and the content is still wonderful, and it is worth recommending to children in the isolated island. As for the children's supplements in newspapers, except for *Shen Bao*, *Xinwen Bao*, and *Da Wan Bao*, the others have been discontinued.</p>
<p>As for single books, now, the Shaonian Publishing House and the Shidai Publishing House are working very hard. Shaonian Publishing House has published more than a dozen kinds, such as *New Southwest Travels*, *Little Sanzi*, and *Little Haber Yang*, which are quite timely. Shidai Publishing House has published more than a dozen kinds, such as *Little Scabies* and *Wild Little Ghost*. The content is very exciting. Among those planned to be published or printed, Shaonian has *New Songs for Children*, *Life of Newspaper Boys*, and *Anti-Japanese War Short Stories*, etc.; Shidai has *Children's Drama*, *Stories*, and *Novels*, etc. In addition, there are the New Children's Small Series published by the New Children's Society, and *Mulan Joins the Army* (children's play), etc. These publishing houses are all run by people who are enthusiastic about promoting children's reading material. Under difficult material conditions, they are working hard to produce excellent reading material. This spirit cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Although, given the huge number of children on the isolated island, this little bit of reading material is not enough. But perhaps, there are many children who have not even had this little bit of reading material introduced to them. I hope that under the slogan of "Save the Children," publishers, small publishing houses, and authors can work together!</p>
<h3 id="e125">A Heart to Cut Flesh <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>"It is a blessing for the poor not to be sick." This is really a golden saying, especially in this metropolis. Not only the poor cannot get sick, but even the middle class is not qualified to get sick. If they are unfortunate enough to get a "rich man's disease," then they can only wait to die. Therefore, when many doctors proposed to refuse prescription commissions, we hoped that in addition to refusing unreasonable commissions, it would be best to reduce reasonable consultation fees as much as possible, especially the consultation fees for house calls.</p>
<p>As for hospitals, at the beginning of a patient's admission, a certain amount of hospitalization fee must be paid first. If there are surgical conditions, then the surgical fee must be paid in full before the surgery can be performed. This may be due to the hospital's regulations, but the law is sometimes transferred due to human relations. Doctors take the welfare of the people as their vocation. If the patient's family delays time due to raising money, wouldn't that delay the patient's life? As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the case of "the head of surgery at Baolong Hospital being accused of negligence" was because the family went out to raise ten yuan for the injection fee, so that "the time interval was too long, the bleeding was too much, and he died of rescue."</p>
<p>The crime of negligence cannot be determined naturally. However, due to the occurrence of this case, in case of emergency and other situations, we still urge you not to be confined to the regulations, and like doing business, "silver and goods are exchanged." As the saying goes: doctors have the heart to cut flesh. Standing in front of an unfortunate person who is about to stop breathing, even if you don't talk about "vocation," on the basis of human compassion, shouldn't a sense of compassion arise spontaneously?</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22 News Travels from Beyond the Sky, Grand Theories and Arguments Believe in the World</p>
<p>Wu Jun Su Dao said: "This is also close to human nature. Like her, she is a person who likes to move and does not like to be quiet. To teach him to sit there obediently and read a book for an hour, I am afraid he will not be able to sit still. So she rummages around and only picks out the magazines she likes to read." Qu Wu Bian said: "But we always admire Sister Huihua's extraordinary intelligence. No matter what happens, as long as he sees it, he understands it all. If she wants to learn this thing, she is desperately energetic and must learn it. She is really a talented and hardworking person." Shao Huihua said: "Okay! Okay! Don't scold people." They gradually walked to a room where Qu Wu Bian worked. Qu Wu Bian invited Wei to sit down for a while. It turned out that Qu Wu Bian was running a supplement in the newspaper, called "Women's Garden", which reprinted women's affairs. In recent years, men and women have been equal in everything, and studying and working are also equal to men, so it seems that there is no need to list a special column for women. However, Chinese women have been bound by thousands of years of restraints, and have only been liberated in recent years. In the open places, there are indeed many upper-class women who strive for progress. If it is in the inland or rural areas, women's knowledge still feels very shallow. Because women account for half of the national population, if women's knowledge is shallow, it means that the culture of a country is low. Therefore, the revived China doubles the promotion of women's education and strives to enlighten women's knowledge. Everyone thought that "Women's Garden" should be opened as a special column. Moreover, in recent years, the number of women reading newspapers has gradually increased, and they also feel that newspapers are life cinemas, what kind of movies, Peking opera theaters, what kind of Peking opera. In addition to compiling the Women's Garden column in the newspaper every day, Qu Wu Shuang also compiles a magazine called "Women's Knowledge." That is a semi-monthly magazine, published two issues every month, and it is also published in this newspaper office, and each issue can sell about 250,000 copies. Therefore, Qu Wu Shuang is also very busy with editing matters. They stepped into Qu Wu Shuang's editing room and felt that the room was not big, but it was cleaned very well. There were also several bookshelves and two writing desks in the room, placed opposite each other. But in addition to Ding Qu Wu Shuang, there was also an assistant. At this moment, the seat was empty, and she had already returned. Qu Wu Shuang greeted these little sisters and said: "Please sit! Please sit! It's just that this room is too narrow, it's really too small to turn around. I have nothing to offer here, but there is some green tea that people sent me. Brew it and ask you all to drink a cup."

<h3 id="e127">A Barrier to Isolate Despair <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— M. Chin. 156</p>
<p>News from London says that British engineers have invented a method to block the advance of enemy troops. This invention seems to have been secretly demonstrated, and the British Minister of Defense, Sir Inski Pool, was also present to watch. This invention is not a barrier to isolate the attacked from death. Although the details are unknown, this amazing news must have been closely watched by military leaders of various countries.</p>
<p>Today, there are some people in the world who use their intelligence and use science to invent all kinds of deadly weapons, in order to make their enemies die early. At the same time, there are also some people who hold a great spirit of sacrifice and devote themselves to research and invent methods to resist and exterminate things that harm human lives. These inventions are also barriers to isolate death, but this kind of barrier is not built between people, but between people and harmful things. For example, nothing is better than eradicating malaria. Malaria is one of the most virulent diseases, and 800 million people suffer from it every year. Doctors and scientists from all over the world have worked hard to research and invent methods to prevent humans from being harmed by malaria parasites.</p>
<p>The Malaria Commission of the League of Nations has made many contributions to the prevention and treatment of malaria. It stipulates that six grains of quinine should be taken daily during the epidemic period to prevent it. Those who have already contracted malaria should take fifteen to twenty grains of quinine daily for five to seven days to be cured. This regulation has been broadcast to the world on the radio so that everyone knows. Page 125 of the 1938 report of the Malaria Commission specifically pointed out that among the various medicines for preventing and treating malaria, quinine is still the most widely used because of its remarkable efficacy, non-toxicity, and general knowledge of its usage and dosage. Those who are troubled by malaria should not only read the above advice, but also follow it and work together to eradicate malaria parasites, so that human health can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Jesus Said Let the Little Children Come to Me (1) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Children! I know you like to listen to stories. Now let me tell you a story first: Once upon a time, there was an old teacher in Germany who took off his hat and saluted respectfully every time he met elementary school students. Others saw it and were very surprised, and asked him, why be so humble and polite in front of children? He replied, "Children have unlimited future. They may do great things and become great people in the future. They must be respected." Later, among the old teacher's elementary school students, there was indeed a great man, Martin Luther, who advocated religious revolution and founded the Gospel Church. That was him. I also have this kind of thinking now. I want to explain to you children my respect for you and hold great hope for your future. I want you to respect and value yourself and not be a despicable and frivolous person. Let me give you a riddle to guess: "Golden antique, silver antique, can be opened but not closed." You must all shout: "I guessed it! It's an egg." That's right, it's an egg, and it can also be said to be you children. Let me explain. Because everything is wrapped in that little egg, everything has to come out of that little egg. What heroes and great men, great politicians, great religious figures, great scientists, and great writers all started as elementary school students. Time passes quickly. In ten or twenty years, you children will all grow up. Here is the most important question: what kind of person will you become in the future? Heroes and great men, of course, came from elementary school students, as mentioned above. But haven't bandits and robbers also been children? May I ask, what kind of person will you become in the future? (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e129">Things Worth Studying Why Garbo Didn't Get an Oscar <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Da Ni</p>
<p>For more than ten years, the most famous movie star in the world has been Greta Garbo. Indeed, who doesn't know her golden sign of "Mystery Woman"! Her unique style has laid her extraordinary position.</p>
<p>However, Hollywood thinks that Garbo can't act, because: she has never won the Oscar for "Best Acting"!</p>
<p>Before she became famous, the award-winning stars were Mary Pickford; when she was at her peak, she was taken over by Katharine Hepburn and Norma Shearer; her younger generations, such as Louise Rainer, also surpassed her and won a brilliant Oscar.</p>
<p>Is it because Garbo doesn't act, or is it that Hollywood audiences have no vision? In fact, neither of them is true. Let me tell you:</p>
<p>When Garbo acts, she doesn't look like she is acting at all, and she is not willing to "sell her strength". Her expression is concise and straightforward, and she doesn't advocate meticulousness. Therefore, some people who can't understand it think this is her shortcoming, but they don't know that this is exactly where she is superior.</p>
<p>Many of those stars who have won awards "once" have been forgotten by people today. However, Garbo's impression is always left in people's memory. This is where her "greatness" lies. We might as well say: not getting an Oscar is not Garbo's failure, but on the contrary, it is her success. Because her success is not "once" or "twice", but "forever"!</p>
<h3 id="e130">Belief of Movie Fans All are Stories of Loyal Martyrs' Struggles <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>A certain newspaper in Hong Kong recently held a "Movie Interest Test", the first item of which was "Which domestic film are you most satisfied with?" The top three were "Isolated Island Paradise" Note: This film may not be shown publicly in Shanghai, because it boldly exposes the deformed state of Shanghai after the occupation, "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" (ie "Ge Nen Niang") and "Street Angel". Another question was "Which part of past history do you think can be adopted as a movie drama 4?" Most of the answers were stories of struggles of loyal ministers and martyrs. The names were listed according to the number of votes: "Yue Fei," "Qi Jiguang," "Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang," "Shi Kefa," "Wen Tianxiang," "Su Wu," "Liang Hongyu," "Burning Red Cliff," "Ban Chao's Abandoning the Pen to Join the Army," "King Yue's Restoration of the Country," "Chairman Chiang's Xi'an Incident," "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "Genghis Khan," "Xi Shi," "Romance of the West Chamber," "Zhang Xun," "Qiu Jin," "Zheng He," "History of the Chinese Revolution," "Eternal Regret of Hong Chengchou," and "Zhuge Kongming".</p>
<p>Note: Several of them have already started filming, such as "Xi Shi" (Xinhua) and "Liang Hongyu" (Guohua), and Yuan Muzhi has the ambition to shoot "History of the Chinese Revolution". He went to the front line in northern Shanxi to capture the history of struggle, which is written here.</p>
<h3 id="e131">A Record of "China Travel" <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yunying</p>
<p>"China Travel Drama Troupe" is active in Shanghai on the isolated island.</p>
<p>"Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise" are their masterpieces. This time they actually experienced them at the Xuan Palace one after another. The troupe's stage supervisor, management, installation, lighting, props, costumes, effects, etc. are all very good. As for the several main roles written in "Thunderstorm", such as Misses Tang Ruoqing, Yuan Zhuru, and Sun Jinglu. Not only do they have the talent for acting, but they are also rich in stage experience. Tang Huaiqiu is also very hardworking. Wang Qiu Zhai's performance of the villain is his masterpiece in his life. What satisfies me most is Miss Sun Jinglu's lines. They are not only clear but also sweet and bright, and at the same time, she knows how to act.</p>
<p>"China Travel has one more thing worth introducing to readers. That is their cosmetics. It is said that before the war, they mostly used imported goods. Now what I see backstage is entirely domestic goods. This is a gratifying phenomenon."</p>
<p>Finally, report a piece of news: "China Travel" is scheduled to perform "Empress Dowager Cixi". The sets and actors are busy with that! It will probably be staged in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e133">"Sanban" is the Most Difficult to Sing (Below) <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>For example, sailing a boat, a banqu is like a boat with a destination. With oars, sculls, rudders and other tools, it goes with a certain amount of manpower. Its movements are monotonous. There is no big change, the line is fixed, there is no room in the heart, and the mountains and trees on the shore cannot be seen. The "sanban" song is like a boat that is not tight, which can accommodate the smoke and rain. Regardless of morning and evening, or journey, it is only up to it to reach. Then one peak, one temple, one pagoda, one bridge can be leisurely admired. Even one lotus, one petal, one swimming fish, one fish scale can be leisurely counted carefully. This is the strength of the "sanban song". What makes my tune difficult to sing is that it has no ban but also has rhythm. You must have no bamboo in your chest, but have the heart to count the falling flowers slowly. Are those woodcutters and lotus-picking and fishing people who do not see this peak, this temple, this pagoda, this bridge, this lotus, this fish day and night? I know that it is difficult to see it every day and night, as if it is not seen. How can Lan Bipin have such cultivation and such indolent ears? Although the Sanban song has no board, it must have something to sing out. What has something is a tune with methods and emotions. After the method is commensurate, the emotion is expressed. The method includes the length of the cavity, the opening and closing of sentences, the four tones of the characters, the yin and yang, the sharp and the round, and the size of the breath, the stealing of the breath and the taking of the breath. The emotion includes the seven different emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, joy, worry, fear, and surprise. If you ponder it day and night, you can respond to the sound and appearance. Now take an example, such as the "Zi Xu Fa Yue" section of the old male fish intestine sword, the anti-Xi Bei Sanban, the "Chen Gong Heart" section of the Cao Fang Cao, the Xi Bei Sanban, and the Erhuang Sanban in the Hongyang Cave Sangyuan. It is not only difficult for the singer to sing, but also difficult for the listener to understand.</p>

<p>— He Nai</p>
<p>Chen Yuelou, Chairman of the Shanghai Theater Association, recently expressed his weariness and submitted a written resignation. All the committee members believed that he was extremely hardworking and responsible in presiding over the association's affairs, so they all advocated for retaining him. A meeting was convened on April 1st to discuss a solution, which was to appoint Zhao Ruquan, Zhou Xinfang, Chen Hefeng, Lin Shusen, Liang Yiming, and Liu Kunrong as representatives to jointly send a letter to Chen Yuelou to persuade him to stay. It is likely that there will be no problem. The association will also organize a charity performance to raise funds for the association's Changsheng Society. This will be launched immediately after the issue of Chairman Chen's resignation is resolved.</p>
<p>Sheng (Old Male Role) Zhang Mingsheng Leaves the Great Stage</p>
<p>Therefore, he was recruited by the New Stage. Now, the Grand Celestial Stage is adding Sheng roles, and they have their sights on Mingsheng. They have negotiated with the New Stage authorities and have obtained Dong Zhaobin's consent. However, all that is needed is a letter from Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Celestial Stage, and it can be arranged.</p>
<p>Kun Dan (Female Role) Wang Huichan, who was invited by the Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theater, was originally scheduled to perform last night, but her costumes were not yet ready, and the theater was also unfamiliar with the style of the play. Therefore, they had to postpone the performance. It is likely that they will be able to confirm the performance date sometime after Sunday.</p>
<p>Film News (1) The five first-run cinemas showing Western films, such as Da Guangming, and the four second-run cinemas, such as Guanglu, have decided to start raising prices on the 6th. Domestic cinemas also plan to follow suit. It is reported that Jincheng will start tonight when screening "Hero in Troubled Times," and Xin Guangming will also increase prices for new films after "Assassination of the King." (2) Jindu Grand Theater, owned by the owner of Jincheng, is located at the intersection of Xulu and Tongfulu and is scheduled to be completed around the Mid-Autumn Festival. (3) The Soviet film "Lucky Fish," which Dumei began showing on the 5th, is very exciting. The accompanying short film "Train to Moscow" is an outstanding educational film. (4) The third issue of "China Film News" will be published today, edited by Rong Yu. Ticket reservations are available at Jincheng, Huguang, and Xinguang theaters.</p>
