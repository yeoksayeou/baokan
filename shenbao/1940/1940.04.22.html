<h3 id="c11">日本侵華戰事的窮途 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>天才的戰爭理論家克勞塞維茨曾經說過：「戰爭不過是政治的繼續……因爲政治的企圖是目的，戰爭不過是手段，而無目的的手段，到底是不可想像的」。這一名言，百餘年來，曾經加强了世人對戰爭本質的認識，同時也幫助了一般學者對歷史的瞭解，至於在政洽家和軍事家之流，更是當作最基本的常識理解着。然而這一决日閥侵略中國的戰爭却是唯一的例外。</p>
<p>日閥的大陸政策，曾有三四十年的歷史淵源，並曾處心積慮加以準備和佈置，所以此次戰事之發生祗是中國民族主義與日本侵略政策衝突的必然結果，並不能說是意外或偶然；因之也就不能說日方之從事這一戰爭在政治上並沒有其確定的最後意欲。但是就兩年餘演進經過來看：在事變發生的順序上是軍事在先，政治在後，政治不過做了軍事的尾巴，以隨時替軍人的冒險行動彌縫補苴爲能事。在戰爭過程的表現上則始終不曾昭示其確切的目標，且游移支離，前後矛盾，至多不過因時制宜的提出幾個空泛口號以資搪塞。戰事進行了將近三載，其中心意義與最後歸宿究將怎樣，泰半的日本國民至今對此仍懵懂無所理解。兩月以前的齋藤失言事件，縱僥倖尚未擴大爲重大的政治事變，而日人內心的苦悶小安，與其對於此一戰爭本質的懷疑，則均已儘情透露出來，絕不是僅把齋藤個人逐出議會所能掩飾。是以如果說日閥所進行的戰事正是屬於克勞塞維茨所謂不可想像的一類，並不是過分苛刻的論斷。</p>
<p>這種缺憾，在日本當局並非不曾理會，前冬近衛在下臺之前，鄭重其事的宣布了關於所謂「東亞新秩序」的聲明，無疑就是要替侵華戰爭奠定一個政治的基礎。彼時而後，內閣雖更迭數四，對於那一原則却始終奉爲最高指導的圭臬，釗近來政治攻勢的急進，阿部一行的來華，其運用更達到最後的節段。然而那一聲明的發布，已是當中日戰爭進行到一年有半，日本舉國上下都因戰事陷入泥沼而煩躁不安的時候。嚴格說來，是視實的需要逼迫出所謂「新秩序一聲明的答案，並不是爲了貫澈那一原則纔爆發的侵華戰爭。縱觀年來日本國內輿論，雖少有人像齋藤那樣公開指摘其空疏無當，却充滿着不理解和懷疑的論調；則其在精神動員方面究竟能收穫幾許效果實爲一重大疑問。然而日本當局就在這一基礎之上着着佈置其政治攻勢，且準備在南京重演伊藤博文武藤信義在朝鮮和東北的故事。這恰像在鬆軟的沙土地基之上建立起連雲的樓臺，乍看起來固然輝煌動人，但也許轉瞬間就全部傾圯。這樣就無怪此度阿部在出發來華之前，並不像伊藤武藤那般躊躇滿志，意氣如雲，反而疑慮叢生，甚至對於個身生命前途都缺乏自信。</p>
<p>米內在日前談話當中曾指摘日本人民缺乏應付艱辛的精神，其原因則諉之於沒有長期戰爭經騐和不曾像歐洲各國那樣吃過痛苦。這祗說明了問題的一部分。中國應付長期對外戰爭的經騐也許比日本更缺乏，然而二三年來，中國軍民上下卻始終能夠堅定沈着，振奮有加，‘不因內外任何變動或日方任何手段而動搖，無非因爲中國是爲了國家民族的獨文自由而戰，這一信念，自事變爆發之始即深入人心，形成顚撲不破的偉力；與日方之缺乏確切政治目標者大相逕庭。日當局縱能在戰事中途以人工製造政治理論、花樣百出的在政治上發動攻勢，終不足以在民間建立堅强信仰並挽回其頹敝的軍心，試看最近日方對華種種措施，官方雖全力以赴，民間則對之漠然，甚或不時發出疑慮的論調。如果近衛聲明可以看成割分戰爭節段的關鍵，則前乎此的日方行動都是軍事的盲動，後乎此則轉而傾全力於政治的投機，都是違反着以軍事手段達到確切政治目標的戰爭原則；將近三年的侵華戰事就是這樣的進行着，現在日方已在政治上投出了最後的一張紙牌，則此後軍事方面的運用，將益難與其政治措施相協調，形成軍事與政治分離的畸形現象，最後必不免於一無是處而同歸挫敗。</p>

<h3 id="c52">工商企業增資平議 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 夏高波</p>
<p>一　弁言</p>
<p>邇來報端頻載各股份有限公司召開股東大會之通吿，以常例而論，此時所討論者不外（一）董事報吿賬略，請求股東大會承認，（二）決議分派盈餘及股息，（三）改選董監（參照公司法第一六八，一三六，一三八，一五二，一五四等條）。惟今日各公司之股東大會開會時，例多論及「增資」問題。增資於公司信用財力關係殊密，故我公司法規定須經「特別決議之方式（公司法第一八六條第二項）；又公司經增資後，與國家稅收（後詳）亦有影響，是則史興公經濟有關，當不可等閒視之。近來滬商（自不限於公司組織）增資之風甚熾，其是否有當，各具理由，惟論者立塲不同，不免病於主觀，爰作平議，願就正於政府主管官署，專家學者，並盼工商界予以愼重考慮，則幸甚矣。</p>
<p>二　贊同與反對之理由</p>
<p>論培資之是否有當，意兒紛紜，茲擇其正當者析爲二類：</p>
<p>甲。贊同增資之理由！</p>
<p>（二）减輕納稅額按我國所得稅及過分利得稅，其稅率均按所得合資本額之比例而定，故股本額不同之二公司有相同之所得額（凈益），稅款仍小同，資本大者納稅少資本小者納稅多。若某公司資本雖小，其盈餘，準備，與秘密或任意公積甚鉅時，則二公司之實際資本殆相若也，可知納稅不同顯欠公尤。故資本較小之公司不妨將公積等轉作資本，以避免此種損失。故增資母容反對。</p>
<p>（二）成本浩大故急需增資物價高漲，成本浩大，原有資本不足以供週轉，故增資以謀營業之發展也。</p>
<p>（三）止付股息等以增效用近以市塲特殊，本屆獲利異厚，分配與股東後，每致浪用於無謂，如經止付（或减付），化爲資金以供營業之擴展，自屬甚宜。且資本充足將來盈餘可多，則自數字之絕對值以觀，反足使國家稅收增加，增資固可同意也。</p>
<p>乙。反對增資之理由——</p>
<p>（一）增加資本無異逃稅此則參照甲項第一點即可明白。</p>
<p>（二）資余充裕助長投機資金充裕後，則在此物價幻變無常之時，足以助長投機，波動物價之高漲。是則增資間接足以影響民生，殊非所宜。</p>
<p>（三）增資抑阻資金內移滬地環境特殊，以遠大之目光衡之，理應使資金內移，鞏固內地金融，發展內地實業，故滬商增資良非所宜。</p>
<p>三　作者平議</p>
<p>上述正反理由，各不稍弱。惟吾人應有一最高之原則，爲平議之基礎。原則唯何？即增資之動機是也。凡意圖逃稅或供業外投機而增資者爲不可，凡求資金之週轉供業務上正當需要者則可容許。此項原則容或失諸抽象，茲就增資之方式分別討論。</p>
<p>增資之方式，不出三途，即實際增資，轉帳增資與消極增資，其繁簡又各不同，分論如次：</p>
<p>中　實　增資實際增資者實際上確實增加資金也，易言之，實際上確實增收現金或其他財產而增加資本之謂，以此種方式而增資者，吾人大體上不得輕易以「逃稅」之罪名而反對。蓋旣實際增資，則其實際所投之財產確比上年度爲高，焉得誣以逃稅。然筆者以爲其增加額須有相當分寸，即應與最近營業額增加之趨勢成比例，更須與物價指數之上升相適應。如逾此限度甚巨者，顯有兼營投機，希圖不正當利益之嫌，殊非吾人所能苟同也。</p>
<p>乙。轉帳增資轉帳增資者，實際上並不增加資金，僅將盈餘等轉作資本，故公司之資本凈值（NetW　orth耶資產减負債後剩餘之數）並未增加。轉帳增資之是否有當，父因轉法不同而異其結論，今就要者簡論之。</p>
<p>（一）任　公積及準備轉作資本任意公積指法定公積以外之公積，各項準備指並無對外契的關係之準備，其轉作資本之結果，絕未增高資本凈值，而此項資力事實上在過去已運用於企業，故會計學家每以「純益之重投資」稱之。其轉作資本也，仍屬純益之重投資，惟在法律上認爲資本而已。對于企業之財力，資金之運用，獲利之能力，絕未增减（若公司對于若干不願以盈餘轉作股本之股東，發還現款，則反使資本凈值减低）可見其增資之目的顯欠正當，其爲逃稅也良無疑焉。是以此種增資之方法，奚能贊同？動機之低劣，手段之無恥，不言可喻。</p>
<p>（二）本屆盈餘之轉作資本近以環境特殊，物價變動失常，故工商企業于廿八年度中獲利均鉅，若干廠商職之花紅有多至一百個月者，其獲利之厚，令人嘆爲觀止。故野心之企業家即思以本屆盈餘（除依法納稅提存公積外）轉作資本，且有堂堂之理由加以辯護（見本文第二節）。此法究竟是否可以贊同，依筆者芻見，以爲未可作一面之定論，當以公司是否確實需要資金爲斷，如公司將盈餘分配與股東後，預料將于本年度感受資金不够週轉之苦，營業之擴展將遭束縛，則不妨依法轉作資本，以應需要。蓋獲利之厚與往昔相差過鉅時，雖用盡一會計上穩　處理之技巧（此爲會計學上之問題，筆者嘗作論會計上之穩健主義」一文，刊載于復旦大學會計學社刊第二期，可供參閱），一亦難以保留，且易遭股東所醫議，故惟有開誠布公，作增資之提議也。若公司並不需要增加資金，則轉作資本即非尤當。</p>
<p>（三）資產重估價之增值與秘密盈餘之公開轉作資本一般企業，平日在會計上每採穩健主義辦法，將固定資產估價甚低，或以種種方法設置秘密盈餘於無形。今則將固定資產種行估價（自必估高），將秘密盈餘使之公開，其增值部分即轉作資本。方今物價奇漲，如固定資產按會計上復置成本（Replacement　Cost）之理論重行估價，則其增值額必甚驚人，夫今日之物價因戰事而上漲，與平日緩和上漲之自然趨勢頗有不同，故固定資產之重估價于今日，在經濟會計理論上是否相宜，似乎不無疑問一，則以資產估價增值轉作資本當亦頗堪商榷，吾人未敢苟同。秘密盈餘實際上即歷年之未分一配盈餘，故得參照轉帳增資第一種所論述也。惟秘密盈餘之設置多無精確之計算，則公開之時大多更難測量，如不愼而過分高估，害莫大焉，故更當加倍審慎。</p>
<p>丙·消極增資消極增資者减少負債以增資也，易言之，公司之債權人以其債權（即公司之負債）轉作股份也，故亦屬轉帳增資之性質，然消極增資之結果當可使資本凈值增高，故筆者不使其列爲轉帳增資之一種，以示此最大之區別。消極增資之是否有當，應視此項債務之是否必需爲斷。倘此項債務爲業務上所必需，非此不足以維持或擴展業務，則乾脆轉作資本，未可厚非。反之，此項債務並非業務上所必需，大可設法償還，而竟轉作資本，其動機之劣不無嫌疑，則增資或非尤常也。</p>
<p>四　結論</p>
<p>上述各點無非爲最高原則之闡明，即凡意圖逃稅或供業外投機而增資者爲不可，凡求資金之週轉供業務上正當需要者則可容許。又十論雖以股份有限公司而言，其他商業組織，增資方式較簡，則前論自得準用，不另專述。平議之是否不偏，立論之是否無訛，尚祈讀者諸君正之。</p>

<p>— 呂仁一</p>
<p>來滬市物價飛漲，疊　空前之記錄。尤以米麵煤球……等日用品爲最，近閱工部局公佈之物價指數，較之戰前竟有超出數倍以上者，少數長袖善舞之商人，固知利用此非常時期，投機囤積，壟斷居奇，大都利市百倍，莫不興高彩烈，惟大多數安份守己之薪水階級，受物價之嚴重壓迫，咸感入不敷出，發生經濟恐慌。推原其故；實以薪給之遞增有限，物價之高漲無窮。一般家庭收支，難趨平衡，引爲杞憂。租界當局，有鑒於斯，對於此項日常用品，固已再限價，設法遏止漲風，以蘇民困，無如一般商人，趨利若驚，不顧平民生計，翻雲覆雨，設計避免限價，始終未能就範。例如大米之限價，則自二十元而三十元，而四十元，竟隨市價而提高。未聞限似獲有多大效果，最近租界當局，對於各商店之零售日用品，勒令標價，藉以鼓勵店全之自動抑平售價。此種辦法之頒行，足見當局關懷民　之殷，贓欲拯人民於水火之中，而爲之解倒懸也。</p>
<p>關於遏止物價之高漲一節，論者多矣！惟考其立論之點，類皆爲直接限制商人之團積，及疏通產地之來源而已。惟吾人須知僅賴當局之權威，限制囤積，恐仍收效無多。至於疏通產地一節，因滬市租界在事實上爲淪陷區所包圍。所有日常用品，仰給於淪陷區者居多，非我政府及租界當局之權力，可以疏通其來源也。雖最近民食調節委員會之辦理集資購買洋米之舉，確能使米價一時不再續漲，固為善策之一。但對共他各物，似仍鮮疏通來源之法。竊思抑平物價之道，在上述各項方法外，苟能引用經濟力量，實施統制，收效或能較宏。夫財源爲經商之命脈，如金融界方面能通力合作，對於押款之承做，嚴密處理，分別規定押放之一辦法，並限制其範圍，則普通商人之財力，究屬有限，投機操縱之弊，可望受相當之遏止。據放近報端公佈之統計；滬市金融界擁有資金二十萬萬元之鉅。夫各華洋銀行，素爲實業界明達之領袖，今旣擁有如此鉅額之資金，苟一方能身爲表率，不作囤積投機之舉。一方協助當局，嚴防投機囤積者之利用其資金，則滬上物價之漲風，或能受相當之限制矣！茲就管見所及，分述如下，以供吾滬市金融界之參考。</p>

<p>最近接到市塲知識問題多則，容於下期本刋併復。知關錦注，特先奉吿。</p>
<p>（一）不做外匯押款：外匯之漲縮，影響於物價者至鉅！粗視之，外匯匯價，僅足左右洋貨之價格，吾人苟決心不用洋貨，似可不蒙其影響，惟稍有經濟學識者，即知其言之未符實情，夫外匯匯價，對任何貨物之價格，均有休戚之關係，而與具有國際貿易性貨物價格之影響尤大！譬諸　茶葉鷄蛋……等物品，海年出口數額殊銳，營此業者，乘外匯暴縮之際，必一大量出口，藉以博取匯兌之利益，同時此類貨物之遝銷國內者，亦隨之而騰責矣！即其他與國際貿易無關係之土貨，亦以一般平素醉心舶來品者，今因限於經濟，祗可降格以求，退而購買土貨，以作替代，土貨之市價，自亦相因而高漲，是以外匯之昇降，對於物價之漲落，確有如唇齒之相關，故吾人如能將匯價加以抑制，則物價不期平準而自入水準矣！對於外匯一匯價，政府雖早經實施統制，惟滬上環境特殊，法紀難申，因而仍爲黑市所操縱，故吾人所欲研究者；即爲如何可使匯價抑平？鄙　如中中交等國家銀行，及匯豐花旗麥加利等主洋商銀行，一致停做外匯押款，即對外匯匯票及外幣鈔票，不予承做押款，則平素投機於外匯之商人，惟有就自有資金之頭襯，購買外匯，若此則外匯之需要减少，其價自跌，物價自亦隨之而下降，據前匯豐銀行曾一度宣佈不做黃金及外匯押款，匯市即疲，觀其一銀行之舉足輕重，竟足以影響匯市，苟滬布全體華洋銀行一，一致不做外匯　款，合力統制，則匯價之抑平，自亦較易，而物價亦得漸趨穩定矣！</p>
<p>（二）不做主要日用品長期押款：……設滬市各華洋銀行，對米麵煤球……等主要日用品之長期押款，不予承做，則經營此類業務者，亦必以財力之有限，不易長期囤積，無法壟斷一市塲，其市價之下降，自亦不難逐漸奏效也。</p>
<p>（三）提高棧租：——滬市各銀行之規模較大者，類多自設倉庫，以利顧客，按諸常例，押戶一方以商品向銀行承做押款，同時即將該項商品存儲銀行堆棧內，待價以售，而銀行方面，亦因外棧押款之不可靠，歡迎押戶，將押品儲存於自備之倉庫，較爲穩妥，若銀行規定對米麵煤球……等日用品，提高棧租，限制租期，則商人自亦無法囤積矣！夫商人之囤積貨物，乃一時權宜之舉，決不因此而特賃房屋，是故商人不欲囤積則已，吾則必須以銀行倉庫爲一尾閭，苟銀行一旦宣佈提高棧租，限制租期，則商人之欲囤積居奇者，勢必裹足不前，此亦爲抑平物價之一法。</p>
<p>滬市各銀行能以身作則，不做投機，切實領導實業界，參照上舉各項辦法，加以研究，確定實施之方針，在可能範圍內少做日用品及外匯押款，提高棧租，則對於物價之抑制，或可獲相當之效果，至於投資之道，望各銀行能條量以其剩餘之資金，設法投人西南諸省之建設事業，則此鉅額之資金，不致閑擱，且亦可博取相當之利益，能協助政府宛成抗建大計，此則更爲吾人所厚望者也！</p>
<h3 id="c56">十磅粗布的成本估計 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>華商布廠，大部汾不幸犧牲於砲火之中，即幸而碩果僅存的，也被魔年所覇佔！自從華軍撤離「大上海」之後，上海，公認是已蛻變而成爲一座孤島？很僥倖苟安得呈露畸形的發達？這冒險家的樂園？善於投機的經商者，是不會輕輕放過的，所以戰後上海的「小型布廠一好像雨後春筍那樣的蓬勃起來了，大多數織布？是粗布（白坏布）如九磅粗平，十磅，上一磅，十二磅，十三磅……等粗，細平布，以及十二磅的粗，細斜紋，而成本約計算，大都平均以十磅粗平做標準的，在戰前一疋十磅粗平的原料成本，（紗本）祇小過四元四角左右，而目前？却需十六元左右了！至於一疋的開繳費（製造費，管理費，統稅等）在戰前也不過一元一二角，而現在却非三四元不可呢！此中尤以物料，電力，煤等增加最烈！市價方面的比較，戰前一疋十磅粗平，賣六元左右，而現在須賣二十二元五角了，售價之高，幾三倍於戰前，試問一般平民，如何穿得起？茲將戰前，戰後的十磅布成本估計和增加的百分率，列表如次：</p>
<p>上述十磅粗平的原料，（紗本）大致是用十支紗作經紗，十二支紗作緯紗，二十五年的十支粗紗售價，不過一百八十元，（每件）十二支的粗紗售價，僅一百九十元，那麼　四二〇磅（司馬秤）的一件紗，去除十支的售價，每磅祇合到·四八五元，又除十二支的售價，每磅祇合到·四五二四元，平均不是只·四四〇元（每磅紗本）嗎？即使用了十磅紗，（工程方面，十磅重粗平的，大概是用紗九磅半，最多用一十磅，除去出見副產品半磅，純粹織用紗，不是依然九磅半嗎？但算紗本，則須以十磅算了一，）紗本四元四角就已够了，而今的一件十支紗，　需六百八十元，合每磅需一·六二元，一件十二支紗，價需七百十元，合每磅需一·六九元，平均計算，每磅須一·六五五元了，和甩九磅半紗相乘，不是成本（每疋用紗）需要十五元六七角了嗎？照上表而論，一疋十磅粗平布的總成本（現今）共需一九·七六元，市價售二十二元五角，再加生產下來的每疋副產品（下脚）的二角，合計是二十二元七角，除去成本十九元七角六分外，廠方所獲每疋的利潤，達二元九角四分之鉅！（戰前僅沾潤，最多六七角而已，）如果，每日夜的生產能力，有—千疋的話，每天不是有二千九百四十元的純益嗎？退一步說，小型布廠生產額少到只百疋，也有近三百元一天的利潤，不是也很可觀嗎？這裏要指出的，就是日紗已與國紗平衡，（而且有時還超過國紗價呢，）不再有什麼便宜貨了！所以過往一　　般貪買東紗的牟利廠商，現在因爲紗本不相上下，（日紗與「國紗」）而內銷方面，誠恐發生問題，故都改爲採辦國紗作爲原料了，這是一件喜訊！也是一個好現象啊！筆者但願其能够永久如此！</p>
<p>附註：一十磅粗平的用紗（每疋）是九·五〇磅，漿水是一·五〇磅，計共重一一磅，至於布重是一〇·五〇磅，副產品是·五〇磅，（二分之一磅合計也是一一磅，讀一者不可不知。」</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>中年人何故會發生腎虧腦弱等症呢？一言以蔽之，此由於靑春時代的過度消耗精血所致。靑春時代若縱欲荒淫，或染有手淫惡癖者，則一到中年上述兩症，無法避免。此外環境不良，用腦過度，勞動過烈，則體力之消耗亦鉅，至中年後，也會發生上述二症，治療之法，端在合理的調攝，切勿操勞過度，房事亦宜節制，攝取當有滋養料的食品，注意運動，勿吸煙酒等品。然後再從事於增精補血療法，方能達到返老還童恢復靑春活力的目的</p>
<p>返老還童之法，盛行於上古時代，然而古人雖道樣日夕以求，可是依然不能如願以償，這是什麼緣故呢？這無非山於古人太側重迷信，不肯根據科學原理加以研究之故。</p>
<p>在現在基於有科學根據之多數實騐的事實，認爲長生不老一法，必須要使用內分泌學識更爲昌明。因爲現代的內分泌學祇能減輕衰老，對於返童尚有待學者的努力。</p>
<p>關於中年人患腎虧腦弱之症，確屬未老先衰所致，對症之治法，必須服以德國梅倫博士所發明之雄壯動物內分泌製劑男用「補體康」，蓋「補體康」完全從猩猩，牛羊，牡鹿，海狗的睪丸中提出其精質所製威，假設因操勞過度，或荒淫斵傷致患腎虧腦弱等症，而投以「補體康」之後，立感性力繁榮，遺精滑精，早洩陰痿，腰　背痛等症，指日可愈。</p>
<p>「補體康」之成分除　類之睪丸精質之外，並有補腦之燐質，補血之鐵質，補骨的鈣質一摻入，凡對於身體任何一部的一衰弱均可治愈。年未過四十之人，若感精不足，面色蒼白，神經衰弱，肌肉削瘦，辦事乏力，卽爲早衰的明症，則內服「補體康」實爲最合理的療法，其女用有調經種子之功，治貧血早衰尤爲對症。</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>用强制之方法，以屈服所欲屈服之目的物，十九要出毛病的。蓋天下無論如何事情，都不能用強暴的力量，去壓服牠的。縱然牠一時雖被惡服著，結果終有一旦大為暴發的。在余二十年以來經騐所得，一般不幸而爲淋毒所患的病家。其初原非即成頑固的病根。然而終於變症百出者，此無他，由於用强制之藥所致也。就淋病各變症中，以攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等症爲最多。此等變症，大多受不良之劣業所致。而不良之局部手術，亦多有變成此等可怖之變症者。要知尿道之生殖器是由海綿體所搆成。而且又富於血管，如果淋菌已從後尿道的粘膜而入海綿體的話，則一般以透膜殺菌爲號召的市上成藥，或者用局部洗滌法，要想從血液中，和海綿體內的淋菌，全部肅淸，那無異在水中撈月，可望而不可即。而且因爲此等療法，是無益而有損的。實宜從速停止此等療法，如其迷而不知自返，那末這種病患　，必致　息千變萬化。益發不易收拾了。</p>
<p>所以最好用極佳的科學方法去治療牠。才可達到全愈的目的。要達到此目的，淋病聖藥「克淋儂」（中英大藥房有售），是淋病患者最合理想的內服藥。因「克淋儂」具有奮發全身細胞之噬菌抗淋的作用。使淋菌無法逃遁。同時以余之經騐，更採用德國感應靜電療法，及德國抗淋血淸等，以爲之輔，故能將一切新舊淋病徹底治愈。絕對不使病家失望。因此等療法，殺菌力旣極周到而溫和。與彼强制之療淋法有殊也</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>許多舊時之淋病療法，經現代專家醫師，及病家證其無效，故新療法之研究，甚　於整個翳學界中，學者埋頭工作，耗盡無數心血與腦汁，卒由試騐管中，發見一治淋眞理，而一時震撼全世界的醫壇。咸認為治療淋病上最大之收穫。時余方負笈美利堅攻讀醫學，銳意研究，博覽歐美各國所出版之醫學雜誌，乃知係根據最新科學之新方法，將提製純凈之色素與蛋白體，侶以其他溫文而具强力殺菌之化學藥品，製爲濬液，取以浸染淋菌，則見淋菌迅即死亡。</p>
<p>有許多學者如Jauregg（1912）R.Kraug（1914.1717）R.Schmidt（1916）諸博士，皆身爲大學敎授，成淋病專科醫師，亦均迭决試騐該劑，證明效力宏偉，蓋試騐管中斜面培養之淋菌平時極爲活躍而生動，若一經注入此藥液於該試騐管中，卽頓見淋菌全部死滅，其後彼德博士，於百尺竿頭，更進一步，乃取純凈黃色素及特製蛋白體等，用精密之消毒手續，製爲內服劑「克淋儂」（中英大藥房有售）從此淋病之治療遂開一新天地。</p>
<p>凡是男女急慢性中之淋病，如男子之急慢性龜頭炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎，女子之陰門炎，陰道炎，子宮炎，卵巢炎，淋毒性白帮等，水藥均有根治之功能。其成效之迅速與正確，久已口碑載道，若女子淋毒性白帶，可一方外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，每晚於臨睡前取一片插入膣道，次晨洗去即得。男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書洗滌尿道，在家秘密自療，則見效之速，尤能出人意表。較之在一般醫生處治療，有過之無不及。此余十數年來臨床經騐所得之結論也。（按「抗淋水」中西太和大藥房均有經售）</p>

<p>不論中醫西醫，對咳嗽一症，均屬難治之症，故肺病之多，遠過任何傳染病，而其死亡率，亦實覺驚人也。故一般人不可以為作風咳嗽，是一小疾，而不加治療，倘不幸而由咳嗽的不治變為肺病，則患者亦不應悲觀，其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，只要攝生和醫治得法，其他並無神秘，依余經騐所得，「補肺拿爾」一藥，頗有鎮咳治肺之特效，不論病狀至二三期之吐血，服此已能絕對根治，然當在治愈時間，宜安靜切勿勞働，並多攝取富有滋養料之食品，則所患尤易治愈了，此為肺癆必愈之條件。</p>

<h3 id="c94">夫婦都應該清夜捫心自問 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>你倆現在的愛情進步呢，還是退步？……</p>
<p>無論妻子或丈夫，如果你想要達造一個美滿家庭，來享受些家庭幸福，那你們愛情的增進或減退，你就得清夜捫心自問個明白：能夠繼續不斷地使愛情增進，進當然她好事。要是你倆的愛情遂漸的減退着，你更應該檢討其根本的原因！有許多組心的女子，她們嫁了丈夫，以為丈夫是常在她的身邊的。每忽略地不加以注意。直待到她的丈夫做了別個女子的情人的時候，她才將信將疑地感覺到慟的丈夫的改變，這時是太遲了！反之，恐怕有更多的男子粗魯地忽略了他的妻子特性的溫柔，而只求實婪地自私的狂歡，焉知強弩之末，不能穿羅竊，這時是多麼的沮喪呢？或於早年即犯自凟縱慾，摧殘了生殖腺內分泌機能，而爆發養遺精滑精，早洩陽痿，發育不全，精薄不育，朱老先衰等症，則于婚後在夫婦生活上即難美滿融洽，或於新婚時尚可數衍，而以後就漸感痿弱無能，或竟於新婚時即一書奠展，不能人道者，這怎能不使青春期的妻子，抑鬱寡歡，或急恨填膺，而演出私奔，離婚等種種悲劇？</p>
<p>忽略了你最重要的事，而多事於無關黔要的事，這是最戀蠢的。丈夫是一家之主，你們夫婦倆愛情的前途，即應深思熟慮地謀其發展。萬一已因早年自凟縱然而有上述症象者，則在今日醫學昌明的時代治療亦並非難事。何必因小而失大，因循以致自誤而誤人！</p>
<p>上述症象之治療方法：據世界名醫及余偉經驗，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑﹃生殖素』最為對症特效。因此劑質料名貴，功效確實，為任何類似製劑所不及。男子於服後一目夜聞即可生精補腎，健腦活血，尤宜不斷連服，則更助長發育，滋養神經、稠濃精血，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力加倍豐足，中老年人常服則延年益壽，返老還實。惟有遺精者，須兼服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲等大藥房均售每厘兩元）以固精關，制止遺洩，收效尤速。</p>
<p>這是最近的事實。患者鄭佳民君。廣東人，婚後有早洩陽痿症象，兼患遺精。雖屢服市上成藥均無效果。上月始由其友介紹至本診所診治，經詳察其病狀後，卽囑其購「生殖素」兩打，「希米脫氏固精片」半打，使之不斷兼服，并間日施用電療注射等最新醫術，為昤不過一月，頃已百病霍然，精力強壯，夫婦問愛情勝猶新婚矣。</p>
<h3 id="c95">遺精腦弱後患無窮 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>青年人的遺精與腦弱症常是相伴而起的。果然用腦過度了也會有遺精，但大多數的人都是因遺精而致患腦弱症。腦是人體動作的紀機關，人們所以能深思明辨，記憶與推理，來完成他有組織有價值的工作，這完令是腦的功用。要她患有腦弱症，那就念麼能行？</p>
<p>遺精後何以會使腦弱？這據醫學上的論斷：精液就是體內的生殖腺內分泌液，此種內分泌液，除由導管輸送於精囊詩營生殖作用者外，其餘的大部分淌能直接滲於血液而灌溉全身，功能滋養腦，性，脊髓等各部神經。青年人若息遺精而因循失治，則腦神經首受影響，於是凡腦弱健忘，失眠心悸，頭昏目眩……導症象叢生，此外凡早洩，陽痿，精力渙散等症象這是性神經寰弱的練微：腰痠背痛，肢體酸軟疲憊，這是脊體神經岌弱等象徵。不特此也，若因遺情而臨精枯血竭，則發育作用亦停滯，新陳代謝機能減退，凡發育不全，未老先衰等症象復相繼而起，此種青年，勢必求學不進，習業難成，為女性所棄，妻妾所恨，茫茫此生，豈不可悲！</p>
<p>遺精青年要補救此無形之殘廢。唯有速服治遺特效藥」希米脫氏間精片」以輩固精關，鎮靜神經，遺精自可於服後當夜痊愈。如因遺精已有上述症象者須兼服健壯動物生殯線素製劑「生殯素」以培補腦腎，精血及神經，能運服不斷，必可於短期內根治各症，使腦力強壯，精神充足，則前途蚩可限量！息者若能親來本診所診治，更可保證治遺。</p>

<p>豐陽天氣百花開，</p>
<p>遊春仕女聯翩來，</p>
<p>豐乳細腰婀娜甚，</p>
<p>人人爭道好身材。</p>
<p>一個丰姿綽約，肉感丰富的健美女郎，倘在此百花競放的豐陽季節，約三五閨友，把譬聯袂，在綠劃如茵的公園中小步閒眺，我相信一定可以引起不少遊人的注目，不但是注目，或许还会有西装革覆的翩翩佳公子，向着她们追求呢。因为「美」「醜」是谁都有眼睛瞧得出来的，無論你怎樣出名的笨俏，或是道學生先，可是當你看到豐腴的臂部，婀娜的腰身，晶瑩的肌肉，明郎的曲線，萬其是胸前高聳的一對乳峯，把左右的衣襟一聳一聳，似在向每個注目的遊人點頭的時代姑娘，那你縱然心無鴉念，然而你那雙尊目，也會不期然而的放射過去，不但放射過去，甚至你已走過她的前面了，還會回轉頭來再瞧上幾瞧，纔覺身心舒泰呢。所以特微發逹的健美女郎，買東西，出入交際，總是到處佔著便宜，即夫婦之間的性生活上，因為她們卵巢機能的特別強盛，性感濃厚也是如魚得水，雙方愛情彌篤，為親友們豐羨不置。可是過去如犯束胸自凟，月經不調，白帶不感等症，致卵巢机能遭遇害摧殘，影响乳峯发育者，则纵然貌丰如花，也难免不为时代男性所厭棄，其命運必非常悲慘！至於挽救之法，據中西服卵巢腺素制劑女用一生殖素」，最為對症而特效。一經進大樂力，培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，倘繼續服用，必能於短期內消滅上述各症，使乳峯高耸，臂部丰腴，面頰红润，增进健美。</p>

<p>在初發之急性症狀，往往於不知不覺中轉入慢性淋者，以余歷年來經騐之結果，蓋除淋菌外，又多混有其他之病菌，萬其是起於桿菌者為多。患者之自覺症為尿道不快憂癢感，或於輕微的疼痛，始乞醫家診治。攝生，故於不知不覺之聞，將淋菌由前尿道侵入後尿道，遂致惹起攝護腺炎，精襄炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，及全身傳染之關節炎等，始知自己之痛非但未瘳，反而已趨亞化。</p>
<p>有時，此等症狀，其尿液並不完全　濁，多呈透明色，或略带少许之淋系而已。但是实際上此等塲所，恒在无意之中，傳染於異性，故已有姜子之丈夫，尤不可不崔惠於此等慢性淋之症狀，耐求其即日治愈。凡是遇到此等症狀時，必須用尿液培養後，反覆檢查，或行攝護腺按　法，獎其滈出之液體，用顯微鏡檢查之，必能　見淋菌及其他桿菌，而確定淋病之　所在，然笨重按症而治，庶幾百發百中，在治療方法上著之，則首　德國　淋平流電療法，以其導子插入尿道内部，然後按病情之轻重而关於电度，後殺菌力直接透射病灶，適可而止。並擇用德國希氏血清，以抗淋殺菌免疫，他如洗浟法，接擊法，冷卻法，溫湯法等，皆可按症而施，則凡如此等症之慢性淋，四五星期即可根治也</p>

<p>滇省出銅考</p>
<p>滇省採辦銅觔，以供京內外鼓鑄之用，每歲共需額銅一千餘萬觔。乾隆年間，以海內殷富，國幣充牣，寶泉寶源二局，旣經減印停鑄，而滇蜀湖廣各省，亦分別停止，然年額銅觔，仍照舊採辦解運；蓋因國課攸關，而銅觔轉運需時，必須廣為儲蓄，以資源源接濟，與其致有缺乏，不若預備有餘也。道光年間，又因各廠　老山空，銅觔產薄，在事員弁，深恐京運不敷，但有能覓子廠之人，即亟令試採，以此廠之有餘，補彼廠之不足。旋有諭旨，着滇省督撫查勘情形，妥議章程，以期去弊興利，足國裕民。且滇省饒金鑛，正不獨銅觔而已。查嘉慶十六年，戶部議　雲南銀廠十六處，抽取課銀以二萬六千五百五十兩零，為每年總額。嘉慶十九年，白沙一廠，衰竭封閉，奉旨開除。此後定有課額者，共十五廠，每年應抽解課銀二萬四千一百一十四兩零，載在戶部則例，而與開化府鶴慶州永北廳之金廠四處，一同按額解課。是辦理礦務，固以滇省為最著，亦以滇省為最久也。林文忠公督雲貴時，又　諭於所屬境內，確切查勘，廣為曉諭，酌量開採，而鎮沅文山廣通等廳縣，以及普洱府屬之他郞廳，均陸續招民試辦，雖風中課額，為數無多，而地利之普於自然者，已可慨見。有土則必有財富，豈可聽棄於地，果能經理得法，未必於國計民生無裨益也。</p>

<p>— 王一之</p>
<p>人力車上有點綴春花燦爛不虛此『行』矣</p>
<p>世　間儘多失意之悲哀與不幸之遭遇，幾許人為熱中名利而亡，又有幾許人，為不能遂名利兩關之最大慾望，憂勞以死，而獨不知犧牲一生精神，以為羣衆謀幸福，或進一步，光大本國文字與學術之光輝，奄忽百年，下與草木同腐，未免太不值得。方今戰局翻新，各國精神病理學家之論盡勸人以愉快之精神，改變環境。予因想及古來藝士文從之恬淡為懷，貧中得樂，吟詩賞花以自造樂境，間接造成一般人愛好自然美之樂境，眞有默轉天機，潛進斯世於太平之無量陰德。宜乎西方各國之對藝士文人，範以銅像，崇拜之而百世弗替者也。</p>
<p>予謂中華為貧國，人民際多難與邦之會，欲求有還大之前途，端賴立志於貧賤之中而自得快樂。貧國憑以穩致太平之方策，莫如　開蒔花之會而策進賞花之遊。先哲有恒言，『不患寡而患不均』，例如歐戰中西方城市，偶缺糧食，茍分配之能『均』，便不愁供給之『寡』。名利之道至促狹，本不能應天下人無限量之『需求』，惟有娛賞大自然之幸福，祇須有最少數之藝士文人，一盡心力，一旦風氣隨之而變，便可使億兆衆同展歡顏。予今特先介紹歐洲蒔花會與賞花遊之『看花旗』，俾我國內同胞，得於此大地春回之日，善悟安貧樂道之方。</p>
<p>荷蘭者，海上之花國也，國中多小農，人工培養之所得，以『精製品，為多，家居無日不以盆載　供養。一九三五年春，海內粗安，國人就北荷省蒿陵Haarlem市近郊之鄕邸Heemstede，大開蒔花會。好事者印製大小不同之『看花旗』多種，數日間散售一空，　至者不可復得，凡作賞花遊之車輛，無論汽車脚踏車，其上莫不綴一旗，迎風招展，興盡而歸。其最小之一種為綢旗，作長方形，上印荷國特產　金香Ｚ（西名錦纏頭Tulip）與水仙為標識。旗長十六公分半，寬九公分半，承旗之鐵　長三十公分30cm，直徑二公釐2mm.，其粗略如婦人結綫用之鐵針，所不同者，為桿上端如洋釘之範成釘帽耳。其另一種，為三角形之呢旗，高十五公分半，橫面最寬處二十五公分半，所承鐵桿與上同。我國唐人劉禹錫看花詩云，『紫陌紅　　面來，無人不道看花回，玄都觀裏桃千樹，盡是劉郞去郞栽。』本人三度去國，前後忽逾二十年，往事如雲，不勝前度劉郞之感矣。</p>

<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>棉　紗市面向上劇漲，棉布價格，也無所底止的貴上去！戰前的一疋十二磅粗斜紋布，僅售八九元的，現在要賣到四五十元一疋了。四十碼角許一尺，而在目前，却要賣到五六角錢一尺，眞所謂蔬菜賣肉價，布賣綢價了！照這樣子下去，豈不是要迫得大家「衣蔽體，盡人而裸，」了嗎？這眞是一個社會生活的嚴重問題啊！</p>
<p>米貴如珠，布貴如金，像我，孩子多的家庭，眞感到束手無策了！所以我家從滬東流亡到滬西以來，屈指快近三年，一家大小的衣服，穿的還是完全舊貨，破的由他破，補綴一下就好了。而況戰前裁製的布衣，質地非常堅靱耐穿，只要穿的時候，處處愛惜，藏的時候，摺疊整齊，那麼年年穿下去，壽命長久，是毫無問題的。筆者常常穿着舊布衣，視同珍　，時刻會想起從彈棉，紡紗，漿紗，織布，成衣的辛苦工作過程，引徵目前布衣綢價的昂貴，愛重舊衣之心僡切。朱柏盧先生說：「一粥一飯，當思來處不易，半絲半縷，恒念物力維艱。一這的確是千古不移的座右銘。吾母也曾訓示過我，說：「惜飯有飯吃，惜衣有衣穿，」古老人的話，眞是金石之　呢。</p>
<p>照現在的「布貴如金」的情形，如　裁製一件布袍子，非化費廿餘金不辦！那麼愛惜一件舊袍子，就等於節省廿餘金，更可以說：於無形中，在支出方面，輕着廿餘金的負擔，儲蓄着廿餘金的資力，茍一家之人都如此，其無形儲蓄的資力，必有可觀，大家又何樂而不為？</p>
<p>故筆者草斯文的動機，就是當此「布貴如金」的艱苦時期，大家還是儘量穿舊衣服，不要在十九世紀的收入中，去打腫臉兒充胖子的，作廿世紀的消費，自討苦吃，願大家三注意焉。</p>

<p>— 何逸厂</p>
<p>凡　人一日不食則飢，七日不食則死。故民以食為天，飮食入胃，本以養生，經脾胃的消化，化為精液，散佈於周身，其餘變為糟粕，從大便排泄而出，所以飮食宜有節制，切忌飽食，飽食非徒無益，而反有害，不但使人多病，且足促短壽命。從前孔老夫子說：『君子食無求飽。』俗語說：『少吃多滋味，多吃壞肚皮。』就是這個意思。但一般人因誤認飮食所以養生之故，往往喜多食濫食，自以為食量宏，身體好，這種觀念，是大誤而特誤。要知一個人的腸胃，有一定的消化工作。若多食了，能使胃　擴張，工作的時間，旣要加長，而消化力的消耗亦愈甚，食物在胃中，便容易發酵，腸壁更容易腐壞。你想，腸胃漸漸受了傷，人的壽命，還能支持長久嗎？丁福保君，近著『長壽的條件』一文中：亦勸人節食。謂歐美諸國人民，每年因貪食而致死者，不知凡幾。足見多食之為害。而且人民在此戰爭蔓延，生活高昂的時期：更宜講求『節食』，飯須少吃細嚼，菜肴順減省為國家留元氣，為自身保健康。於國家庭經濟，也大有裨益。現在日本和英德諸國，都舉行『節食運動』，我國人值此國難嚴重，且在這『人貧世定』的情形下，實在也應該加以提倡。</p>
<h3 id="c117">暈船 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 基茲</p>
<p>凡　是坐過海船的人，都嘗過暈船的痛苦吧！</p>
<p>暈船的時候，先是覺得有些顛顛倒倒，像弄不淸坐在什麼地方似的；接着便感到前額像在微跳，有些痛，腹部不舒服，全身出冷汗，而面色也變成蒼白，嘴脣成紫藍色，眼球更佈滿血筋，最後便是吐，先吐完胃部的食物，更吐完白色的粘液，接着只有乾嘔。</p>
<p>暈船是如此痛苦的一回事，希而這究竟是什麼原因呢？據一般的學說，以為暈船是因為內耳的前庭神經因船身的動搖所引起的反感。前庭神經是保持身體平衡的一種神經，它的細毛狀的末梢知覺器，突出在淋巴液內，當我們的頭部作急速運動時，淋巴液的壓力跟着搖動而變了起來。前庭神經的細毛狀的末梢，也受了動搖，依此而傳遞到各神經，為保持身體的平衡，將保持身體平衡必要的各部筋肉作為痙縮；同時直接間接刺激着迷走神經和其他的神經而影響到消化器管（胃、腸）循環器官（心、血）等等。於是暈眩頭能，臉色蒼白，嘔吐等等都跟着來了。</p>
<p>他的原因是如此；所以他的治療方法，也只能是局部的。譬如胸部不舒服，打開窗子，換換空氣，做做深呼吸。想免除嘔吐的痛苦，腹部還是空虛些好，找些別的事分分心，不要存了心怕暈眩，不要讓惡劣的周圍來刺激你的神經。藥物方面，還沒有特效藥發明，普通用些鎭靜劑和鎭痛劑，有時候也用些麻醉劑，但都算不上根本的辦法。</p>
<p>總之，身體強壯些，或從小習慣乘船乘車的人都要好一點，而神經質的人是更容易罹這種病的。</p>

<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>衣　服對於人估，效用是禦寒和護衛皮膚，外形是表現口恪和精神，一切不同樣的生活方式，也都能從服裝上顯露出來。但是，人類生活逐漸變遷演化到現在，享用自然也就隨創造而進步了。衣服在都市人羣的生活上，已站了上裝飾物的地位，多數是只求形式與質料的優美特殊，藉以宣示本身的高貴，於是乎，社會間就產生了「只重衣衫不重人」的畸形觀念，一切奸邪，險惡，殘忍，欺詐，都在外形優美的掩護下滋長着，存續着。</p>
<p>我們只要留意報上的社會新聞，就可得到明確的例證。什麼服裝華麗的少女在百貨公司裏偷竊物品；衣冠楚楚的少年在書店裏偷書等等；可見得在上海這地方，根據服裝的優劣而評判人的品性和人格的方法是錯誤的。明白地說：有許多上海人住的是攔樓，三餐之中就有兩餐吃不飽，而們走出門，服裝却很華麗，走進任何大公司或大厦裏，即管門人也見而謙恭有禮，非但不敢把這種人當窮　三看待，且目為好顧客。坐汽車的人連汽油錢也付不出，東挪西欠，仍要駕中午車疾駛於市的也很多。債台高樂，而衣食住行的場面仍很闊綽的也有，—不過，這得要有「藝術」手腕才行，不然，是不會有的。</p>
<p>另一方面，—尤其是戰後，有些人的服裝外形完全是一個鄕曲的典型，破衣布履，補釘之上再加補釘，樣子是十足的窮措大，走在路上乞丐也不會向他們討錢，而他們實際上呢？却有的腰纏　　。在上海埋地窖雖不可能，但在他們的破衣破絮之中，說不定還有成千成萬的鈔票藏之着：這種人旣不偷，又不搶，行為絕對主尚，僅因衣服不入時而不被人重視罷了。曾有一個在銀樓服務的人告訴我：在銀樓中十有九是歡迎摩登人物，因為一般摩登人物走進銀樓來購飾物，往往會把隻一錢重的掉隻八分重的，結果還要找他幾元；倒是一般鄕曲打起戒指來愈粗愈好，圍裙一撩，肚兜或腰帶之中的鈔票，會一捲捲的抽出來。因此，銀樓中對於這種人，大都是另眼相看。</p>
<p>從這種經驗之談上，已充分地暴映出虛浮殷實的分野，衣服與人的神秘性也粉碎無餘。「空心架子」一戳穿，什麼都不值。華麗的服裝僅能遮蓋軀殼上的污點，決不能隱蔽人格品性的卑鄙，和財力的空虛。在力求戰時經濟節約的現在，我們更要具朋相當的定力，只要能够維持體溫，不必顧慮到客觀的評價，以人格品性來表現眞美，因為只重衣衫不重人」的畸形觀念並不是絕對的啊！</p>

<p>欲免受痛苦　滅除煙毒</p>
<p>鴉片流入中國以來，不知坑害多少有為之士，而自上海成為孤島，因來源斷絕，土價高漲，本售每兩三元左右之雲土，自去年入秋以來，漲至每兩四五十元，然尙無眞雲土可得，龐君子羣乃無不叫苦連天，復因吸食攙和雜質之劣土，中毒愈深，亦有改吸更毒之嗎啡海洛英等，洵一嚴重之問題也，記者近記戒煙專家白克路公健醫院來公亮醫師，詢以今日煙土之毒害情形，承來醫師詳述一切，語皆中肯，大可以供黑籍同胞之參考也，</p>
<p>據來醫師言以前之雲土川土等，因係純正之植物，為害尙淺，今則雲土川土，來源斷絕，當局亦嚴禁種植，故市上所售者，大都用海洛英，高根，司的銀等各種烈性毒物，攙入「料子」內混合而成，所以吸後常有頭暈，胸悶，心跳，胃呆，口渴，氣急，睡眠短少，四肢痠痛，面容灰黑，皮膚發現奇癢之小紅點等現象，又在吸時覺氣味兇烈，但雖暢吸，亦不能振奮精神，一轉瞬卽告消失，以故吸者出如是高貴之代價，而吸此種劣土，眞合了一句「飮鴆止渴」之古諺，</p>
<p>觀於上述情形，今日吸食鴉片，實等於自掘墳墓，但吸烟者何不戒除豈非自甘墮落，其實，這也不能怪吸烟者，因為戒烟本非容易，而吸現在之劣土者，尤非富有經驗學識及配合名貴之藥物，更難根本剷除烟癮，故彼戒烟者，不明此中眞理，或貪價格低廉，或求時期迅速，或則完全感於誇大宣傳，如此戒烟，自然屢戒屢吸，永難斷根，甚至烟癮未　·身體反而衰弱·故吸烟者之屢戒屢吸·不能怪其無恒心·而當怪其對於醫師，不加愼重選擇</p>
<p>求醫師又方，因此之故，我之為人戒煙，為維持十數年來之聲譽，保證負責安全戒除起見，不用打針，（因打針每多流弊），不以迅速眩人，（因欲速則不達），完全分析吸煙者之吸量，煙質，時期，身體，心理，病情，然後支配名貴藥物，分別施戒，不但煙癮戒除，疾病亦同時治療，更為顧全吸煙者之經濟時間，戒時不令住院，照常工作，抑且身心舒泰，精神煥發，他如嗎啡白麵等，亦用同樣最根本最有效之方法施戒，故結果差幸都能完全斷癮，永不返癮，日進健康，總之，一人有一人之體質性情，以及烟毒之深淺，決非取巧一時，或默守陳法，所可奏效也，</p>
<p>來醫師戒煙負有四大特佔（一）飮食增加（二）睡眠安穩（三）大便通暢（四）精神煥發並為取得受戒者信仰起見，先行配藥試服二天，認為滿意，再行正式施戒，決無絲毫痛苦，所以英筯介白克路二〇八號公健醫院來公亮醫師，是戒煙者不可不登之彼岸</p>

<p>— 小押</p>
<p>運動是人生不可缺少的東西。我們除了日常普通的（例如走路等）或操勞的（例如洗衣服等）運動外，毫無疑問的，我們還需要一種特定的有規律的運動。這就是說，我們每日要有一定的運動：例如早操，打球，騎馬，游泳……等。但是，我們身處鴿籠似的孤島上，住的地方已經發生問題，怎麼還有餘剩下來的空的地方供給我們來運動呢？即或有之，亦不過是供給一些高貴的小姐哥兒們去消遣罷了。</p>
<p>因爲運動園地的缺乏，隨之而來的，就是居住在孤島上的民衆的健康也受了狠大的不良的影響。現在，雖則還有人在行室內的運動法來補救這個缺點，但這不過是極其少數的人吧了！</p>
<p>最近重慶航訊公佈：敎育部與社交部規定五月五日起至十二日止為國民體育衛生運動週，並飭令全國各省市社會局及教育廳舉辦中小學學生健康檢查。老實說，我們對於這一個運動是不可不加以注意和推行的；由於這一運動的提倡，我們更可以知道政府對於國民，尤其是靑年的健康衛生的注重了。同時，我們還可聯想到近日孤島上居住的人們的健康一帶有病狀而蟄居在孤島七的，恐怕要佔半數。」這一個驚人的數目之後，眞會有「惄焉如　」之概。我們對於這一個運動是不司輕視的，同時，更應響應這一個運動，並希望全市的醫生們，在這一個運動舉行的日期內爲全市的人們來一個義務健康檢查。</p>
<h3 id="c124">洗浴的問題和清潔 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 自立</p>
<p>天氣又要熱起來了，於是這人口稠密，住得像鴿籠般的上海，又發生了問題。冬天一室多擠幾人還不要緊，可是在熱天就不行了，尤其是如學校等的宿舍，衛生問題更需注意上海學校的宿舍，大都很狹小，崦住了不少的學生，手日學校對學生的清潔衛生，又都十分疏忽，不加注意，所以宿舍裏往往十分紛亂齷齪，在夜裏更充滿了特殊的氣息，這樣對青年學生的健康確有極大的妨害。</p>
<p>在這種環境之下，作過分的要求要學校當局來徹底改良或許是不可能的，不過在這炎夏即將至的時候，公共地方狠容易發生危險的疫病，所以吾狠懇切希望學校能實行下列各點，作預防之計：</p>
<p>第一及早令學生全體種牛痘及注射防疫針。第二，設備洗浴處，天熱後洗浴亟需，但至澡堂所費不貲，多數學生決負担不起，所以學校應自設浴室，或與澡堂接洽，優待學生。第三，應注意學生寢室之整潔，更需注意者，學生對被褥往往一學期不換，更有不整理者，故先生應時常督促學生勤換或哂洗被褥，經常舉行　室之大掃除。</p>
<p>「健全之精神寫於健全之體格」，希望今日學校於敎吉學生之時，更注意及學生之健康。</p>
<h3 id="c125">「片面蛋」的辨正（一） <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>閱十九日（力人」君所作「片面蛋」一文，指包飯作每日用向餅乾公司買來的「蛋黃」作菜。他說；「……你想，蛋白質旣被餅乾公司抽去用作餅乾之用，那末這渣滓豈非毫無益處……但是我們不一定要吃葷菜，吃這種「片面蛋」我們寗可吃靑菜豆腐。」</p>
<p>我們出了較低的代價吃包飯當然沒有自家烹飪或上菜館的舒服，同時包飯作在百物騰漲聲中，供給我們的膳食，也只得向價格較廉的目的地操辦食料，這是他們謄本苦衷，我們應該原諒他們。而且在目前情形下，我們能吃到「蛋」，也可算饑餓線上的幸運兒了。</p>
<p>還有，「蛋黃」並不是件壞東西，比「蛋白」少了些「蛋白質」而有大量（脂肪」，而且和「肥肉」的營養成分不相上下呢。現在我把「蛋白」「蛋黃」「靑菜」「豆腐」之營養成分之百分比寫在下面，和猪肉作個比較：</p>
<p>蛋白質　脂肪</p>
<p>蛋白　二〇·六　無</p>
<p>蛋黃　一六·二　三〇·七</p>
<p>青菜　一·七　〇·二</p>
<p>豆腐　三五·〇　一八·〇</p>
<p>肥猪肉　一四·〇　三七·三</p>
<p>瘦猪肉　一九·五　六·八</p>
<p>（二）立之</p>
<p>（上略）就營養方面而言，蛋黃確較蛋白更有滋補的價値。二者所含的成分如下：</p>
<p>蛋黃　蛋白</p>
<p>水　四九·五　八六·二</p>
<p>蛋白質　一五·七　一二·三</p>
<p>脂肪　三三·三　〇·二</p>
<p>此外，蛋黃遝富於甲乙丁三種維他命，並含多量的鐵和燐，這些都是補血資腦的原素。目前歐美的營養學家，有主張吃蛋，應棄蛋白而食蛋黃的，就是這個道理。這樣看來，所謂（片面蛋」，倒是一種滋養的食品呢！</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Dead End of Japan's War of Aggression Against China <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The brilliant war theorist Clausewitz once said: "War is merely the continuation of policy... because the political objective is the purpose, war is merely the means, and a means without a purpose is ultimately unimaginable." This famous saying has, for over a century, strengthened the world's understanding of the essence of war, and has also helped general scholars understand history. As for politicians and military strategists, they understand it as the most basic common sense. However, this war of aggression against China by the Japanese warlords is the only exception.</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords' continental policy has a historical origin of thirty to forty years, and they have painstakingly prepared and arranged it. Therefore, the occurrence of this war is only the inevitable result of the conflict between Chinese nationalism and Japanese aggression, and cannot be said to be accidental or coincidental. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Japanese side did not have a clear final intention in engaging in this war politically. However, judging from the evolution over the past two years, the order of events was military first, political second, with politics merely acting as the tail of the military, with the ability to mend and patch up the military's adventurous actions at any time. In the performance of the war process, it has never shown its exact goal, and is shifting, disjointed, and contradictory, at most putting forward a few empty slogans in due course to perfunctorily cope with the situation. The war has been going on for nearly three years, and most of the Japanese people are still ignorant and incomprehensible as to what its central meaning and final destination will be. The Saito slip of the tongue incident two months ago, even if it was fortunately not expanded into a major political event, the inner suffering and anxiety of the Japanese people, and their doubts about the essence of this war, have all been fully revealed, and cannot be concealed by merely expelling Saito from the parliament. Therefore, if we say that the war being waged by the Japanese warlords is precisely the kind that Clausewitz called unimaginable, it is not an excessively harsh judgment.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities were not unaware of this shortcoming. Before stepping down last winter, Konoe solemnly announced the so-called "New Order in East Asia," undoubtedly to lay a political foundation for the war of aggression against China. Since then, although the cabinet has been changed several times, that principle has always been regarded as the highest guiding principle. The recent rapid political offensive and the visit to China by Abe and his party have reached the final stage of their implementation. However, the publication of that statement was when the Sino-Japanese war had been going on for a year and a half, and the whole of Japan was restless and uneasy because the war had fallen into a quagmire. Strictly speaking, it was the needs of the situation that forced out the answer of the so-called "New Order" statement, not the war of aggression that broke out in order to implement that principle. Looking at Japanese domestic public opinion over the years, although few people have openly criticized its emptiness and inappropriateness like Saito, it is full of incomprehension and suspicion. It is a major question whether it can ultimately achieve much effect in terms of spiritual mobilization. However, the Japanese authorities are setting up their political offensive on this basis, and are preparing to replay the story of Ito Hirobumi and Muto Nobuyoshi in Korea and Northeast China in Nanjing. This is like building towering pavilions on a soft sandy foundation, which may look brilliant and moving at first glance, but may all collapse in an instant. Thus, it is no wonder that Abe was not as complacent and high-spirited as Ito and Muto before he set out to China this time, but was instead full of doubts, and even lacked confidence in his own life and future.</p>
<p>In a recent speech, Yonai criticized the Japanese people for lacking the spirit to cope with hardships, blaming it on the lack of experience in prolonged wars and not having suffered like the European countries. This only explains part of the problem. China may lack even more experience in coping with long-term foreign wars than Japan, but for the past two or three years, the Chinese military and civilians, from top to bottom, have always been able to remain steadfast, calm, and invigorated, and have not been shaken by any internal or external changes or any means of the Japanese side. This is simply because China is fighting for the independence and freedom of the nation, a belief that has taken root in the hearts of the people since the outbreak of the incident, forming an invincible force, which is very different from the Japanese side's lack of a clear political goal. Even if the Japanese authorities can artificially create political theories in the middle of the war and launch political offensives in a variety of ways, they will ultimately be unable to establish a strong belief among the people and reverse their declining morale. Take a look at the recent Japanese measures towards China. While the official side is going all out, the public is indifferent to it, or even from time to time voicing doubts. If Konoe's statement can be seen as the key to dividing the stages of the war, then the Japanese actions before this were military blunders, and after this, they turned to devoting all their efforts to political speculation, all of which violated the war principle of achieving clear political goals by military means. The war of aggression against China for nearly three years has been conducted in this way. Now that the Japanese side has thrown out its last card politically, it will be even more difficult for the military operations to be coordinated with its political measures, forming an abnormal phenomenon of separation between the military and politics, and will ultimately be unable to avoid being useless and failing together.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Fifth Session of the National Political Council - Supplementary Record of Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Secondly, developing the economy. My colleagues in this council have paid the most attention to the economy during the war. Whether reviewing reports or discussing proposals, they have been particularly thorough on economic matters. Many issues are already being considered by the government, and it is hoped that collective wisdom can be gathered to solve them. I am deeply gratified by your enthusiastic contributions. However, I have a few points I would like to mention in passing. I believe that China's economy is different in nature from other countries and cannot be viewed in the same way. It is natural for wartime economies to become more difficult over time, and China is no exception. However, China's war of resistance has been going on for nearly three years, and our past economic situation has been different from that encountered by other countries during the war. It can be said that the past two years or so have been generally better than in other warring nations. This is because our economic structure was not sound before the war, and our economic foundation was not fully developed. It is not easy to be able to sustain it until now, and the main reason is that China's economy is natural and suitable for a protracted war of resistance. The wartime economy is different from other industrial countries. Everyone is very concerned about the current problem of rising prices, but my view is somewhat different from yours. I believe that the prices of daily necessities for people's livelihood must be suppressed as much as possible, hoarding and speculation must be strictly prohibited, and transportation and supply must be improved. However, there is no need to worry about the future of the entire economy. This is the same as my view of military affairs before the war. It is not that we have no way to deal with the economy, but that we have not yet done our best. Otherwise, there will be no difficulties. Everyone must know that what our country now possesses are the three key elements of vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. We can obtain food and clothing anywhere. As for the problem of housing, it is even easier to solve. Clothing, food, and housing are the three major needs of the national economy. As long as we manage these three things properly and transport them effectively, there will be no problems. Therefore, I believe that as long as we work hard to produce, there is nothing to worry about regarding the future of the wartime economy. Moreover, the war of resistance is beneficial to the development and completion of our entire economic plan. The longer our war of resistance lasts, the more effective our economy will be. Furthermore, we have already established a second (three-year wartime economic plan). I can say that our wartime economy has absolutely no problems. We must know that diligence and hard work are the characteristics of our nation. As long as the government and the people work together with the spirit of wartime, not only will there be no problems, but we will also be able to make extra progress. Now, we must follow our established economic plan and the proposals of the conference, work hard to achieve them, and seek their implementation. Not only must the government make special efforts, but our citizens must also work together to supervise themselves, urge the government, and cooperate to increase production and manage properly. I can say that this will not only sustain the war of resistance but also gain the sympathy of friendly nations. If the situation becomes several times more difficult in the future, we will still be able to be self-sufficient and make our economic power stronger as we fight. Here, I would like to remind everyone, and the general public in particular, that we must be able to endure pain and hardship. We must not live our current wartime lives according to peacetime standards, and we must not complain about suffering even a little. We must anticipate that the future will be ten or twenty times more difficult than it is now. Therefore, we must now resolve to endure hardship and pain to bear this pain and overcome this difficulty. We must increase production as much as possible, reduce consumption to the extreme, and improve all economic measures at any time. The government must be extra responsible, and the people must be extra diligent and persevering. We must take the period after the Southern Song Dynasty when people indulged in ease and comfort and sought temporary safety as a warning. We must know that if the court and the public at that time could have endured pain, worked hard, and strived for progress, they would not have perished. Moreover, our foundation for victory has now been established. I dare say that the enemy will never be able to destroy China in the future. I am only afraid that we ourselves will be lax and disorganized, leading to our own destruction. Therefore, we must be especially responsible, pay attention to integrity, and not allow the achievements made by the bloodshed of our soldiers and the suffering of our compatriots to be completely ruined. In the future, with regard to the economy, we must adapt to the situation and gradually improve our measures. If we discover shortcomings, we must correct them immediately. Corruption must be punished, and negligence must be abandoned. In short, as long as we can endure pain and hardship, we will surely achieve the goal of victory in the war of resistance. Thirdly, regarding the implementation of constitutional government, in this session, everyone spoke frankly and openly and expressed their opinions as much as possible, and the discussions were very enthusiastic. Although we did not reach a conclusion due to time constraints, our colleagues can continue to study after the meeting to achieve success. This council will send the draft constitution and everyone's opinions to the government for the National Assembly to adopt and make the final decision. I briefly expressed my views in the middle of the meeting two days ago, and now I want to reiterate a few words. I believe that whether the constitution itself is perfect is one issue, and whether it can be implemented is another issue, and who implements the constitution is also an issue. Everyone must know that the people I am referring to today as those who implement the constitution are not referring to the government alone. In my opinion on the implementation of the constitution, on the one hand, the government must assume the responsibility and ability to implement the constitution, and on the other hand, the people themselves must have the responsibility and ability to implement the constitution. I am currently in charge of administration, and the views I expressed the day before yesterday were not from the position of the administrative authorities, fearing that the government would be bound by the constitution. This is the same as everyone's enthusiastic discussion of their own views on the constitution. This is not for our own sake, but for the benefit of the country and the people in the future. I personally hope that the constitution will be established, not just for a year or two, but it has been my consistent hope for ten years that the constitution can be promulgated and implemented as soon as possible. However, my heart is completely a blank slate, and there are absolutely no preconceived ideas. My only hope is that after the constitution is promulgated, especially in the first ten or twenty years, it can be implemented effectively and smoothly, without obstacles or disputes. The Republic of China has been established for almost thirty years. Our country has not been able to embark on the right track of democracy, and there have been countless disputes over the promulgation and destruction of laws. Many of our colleagues here today have personally experienced this and suffered this pain. We all have the responsibility to implement the constitution. We must not forget the painful experiences and lessons of the past thirty years, and we must not forget the infinite pain suffered by the people of the whole country over the constitution issue, and the infinite losses suffered by our country. Therefore, we must not casually adopt a constitution today that will cause the country to suffer further losses and the people to suffer further pain. Therefore, I would like to sincerely contribute two points: (1) The matter of constitution-making should be entirely for the true benefit of the country and the people. We should not only pay attention to the past but also consider the present and the future. With regard to the past, we must pay attention to our country's history and consistent national conditions, and learn from the painful lessons since the Republic of China. With regard to the present, we must consider the actual environment of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and at the same time, with regard to the future, we must also consider the future situation within ten or twenty years after the promulgation of the constitution and the long-term plan for the country and the nation, and establish a good foundation for the constitution. We must carefully consider how to strengthen national defense, how to develop the overall happiness of the people, and how to consolidate the true rights of the people. I often say that the most important thing in the meaning of implementation is to be thorough. We must ensure that there is not a single provision that cannot be implemented in order to establish an unshakable foundation for constitutional government. (2) Since we want to build China into a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution must not be violated. Since we all unanimously support Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we must understand the essence of the distinction between (power) and (ability) and the true meaning of the creation of the Five-Power system. We must not have any conflicts with the provisions of the Five-Power Constitution. If there are any provisions that we believe cannot be achieved for the time being and need to be gradually strengthened and gradually improved, then we must of course have the temporary expedient of making temporary changes. However, we must not have any attached conditions to the Three Principles of the People, nor can we have any clauses in the constitution itself that violate the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. Therefore, I believe that the provisions of the constitution should be adapted to the facts as much as possible, and we should pay attention to our many unwritten precedents. Therefore, the provisions should not be too detailed and should be flexible, and each provision should be practical. The above has reviewed the most important issues of this session and contributed my personal opinions. Now, our fifth session is adjourned. Within six months, we will convene the National Assembly. Our work of resisting the war and building the country is becoming increasingly tense. After the adjournment, there are many matters that we expect our colleagues to work together on. In the past, our colleagues have gone through thick and thin together, avoiding hard work and complaints, and working together with one heart and one mind to overcome difficulties. This is not only my personal gratitude but also gives the greatest encouragement to the soldiers and civilians of the whole country. Today, I would like to give everyone a word: to complete the task of resisting the war and building the country and save our country, the most important thing is to pay attention to practice. Everything cannot be divorced from reality. This is what I always warn myself and hope to encourage each other with my colleagues. Because the work of saving the country must be difficult and hard. Not only are we physically exhausted, but we are also mentally more exhausted. We must pay attention to practice, avoid hard work and complaints, and be careful and considerate of danger. We must work together and not be careless in the slightest. What I have always warned myself in my life is not to be ambitious. We must know that our most important task is to seek China's independence, freedom, peace, and equality. Now, the Japanese soldiers have not yet been driven out, the country has not yet been successfully built, and the people are still suffering. In the eyes of foreigners, we Chinese are really not as good as slaves of a conquered country. Therefore, we must not forget the current pain and shame of our country. Throughout history, cliques and factions have harmed the country by ignoring the country's difficulties and dangers. Therefore, they indulged in mutual rivalry. What Japan hopes we will create is such a lax and disorganized country. And the spirit expressed in this session is completely contrary to their malicious speculation. This is a very powerful counterattack against the puppet Japanese. I hope that our colleagues will be down-to-earth in the future, whether in constitution-making and implementation or in resisting the war and building the country, and lead the people to fight hard with a pragmatic spirit. In short, we must faithfully estimate the current real environment and take on all the difficult and dangerous tasks that we should have. We will not boast, and we will not belittle ourselves. I hope that all colleagues will carry forward the consistent spirit of sharing weal and woe over the past two years and work harder for the country and be frank friends for each other in the future, and work together to carry out our sacred mission.

<h3 id="e14">Military Commission Announces Weekly War Situation - April 12 to 19 <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing The spokesperson of the Military Commission stated that during the week (April 12 to 19), the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Shanxi inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army and achieved astonishing results. The following is a summary of the combat process:</p>
<p>After recapturing Jing'an, Fengxin, and many other strongholds in northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army continued to besiege Nanchang and Anyi and launched a heroic positional battle with the Japanese army, who were stubbornly resisting. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and several more major strongholds were recaptured. In order to save the critical situation, the Japanese army launched a large-scale counterattack starting on the 14th, attempting to occupy Xiangtang for a long time. After the Chinese army's brave attack and two days and nights of bloody battle, the Japanese army was finally defeated, and Xiangtang was recaptured. The remaining Japanese army retreated to Nanchang. The Chinese army fiercely pursued, and the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. In the past two or three days, the Japanese army has continued to receive reinforcements in the Nanchang and Anyi area. The Chinese army's various units have taken advantage of the Japanese army's unstable footing to continue their full-scale attack and inflicted fatal blows on the Japanese army near Nanchang. The Japanese army is trapped in a heavy siege and is extremely panicked.</p>
<p>The Chinese army in Hubei has launched a large-scale attack to break through the stubborn Japanese army and approach the outskirts of Wuhan. They have engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the Xinzhou and Tuanfeng areas, inflicting extremely heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese army retreated to Huanggang and Tuanfeng, not daring to make any reckless moves. They recaptured the two major strongholds of Macheng and Dupo and are taking advantage of the victory to expand their battle results. They defeated the Japanese army that attempted to invade Qiliping, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. They are fiercely pursuing the retreating Japanese army, and the vanguard has reached the city of Huanggang. They have repeatedly carried out flank attacks on the Japanese army in Wangdian, Sunqiao, and other places, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. The Japanese army trapped in Wuhan is greatly threatened.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Linqu, Juxian, Rizhao, and other places in southern Shandong has been gathering the remnants of the Japanese army for days and launched a large-scale invasion of the area east of Linqu in separate routes. After the Chinese army's mobile counterattack, they engaged in fierce battles, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army collapsed completely and retreated in disarray. Their so-called "mopping-up" attempt has completely failed. At the same time,</p>
<p>The Chinese army in northern Jiangsu took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army, echoing each other. In the past few days, they have successively invaded Funing and approached Lianshui. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese army is feeling the pain of being unable to attend to both ends. Near Changzi in southeastern Shanxi, fierce battles have been raging for the past week, with nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers killed. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi has also gathered seven or eight thousand troops, dozens of cannons, and more than twenty aircraft and launched a large-scale invasion of the Zhongtiao Mountains for the eleventh time. The Chinese army used a mobile posture, using superior terrain to attack from all sides. The Japanese army fled in panic and was unable to cope. As of the 18th, over two thousand Japanese soldiers had been killed. In addition, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack and captured Hengshui Town in one fell swoop and is continuing its attack. The Japanese army's dream of cutting off the transportation between Shanxi and Henan will definitely not succeed. In addition,</p>
<p>The Chinese army in southern Chahar has been fiercely attacking the Japanese army invading Yuxian for days. As of the 14th, over six hundred Japanese soldiers had been killed. The Chinese army in southern Hebei attacked Daming and defeated the Yamaguchi team of the Japanese army invading near Dongming, inflicting heavy casualties. The Chinese army recaptured Luowang Station in northeastern Henan, and over half of the thousand Japanese troops invading Shouxian in central Anhui were wiped out by the Chinese army. Fierce battles are now taking place in the suburbs. In western Zhejiang, the Japanese army in the Hangjiahu area was defeated one by one, and they rushed into Haiyan Jiangnan, fiercely attacking Miaoxing Town, threatening Shanghai. In Guangdong, Jiangyimen was captured, and in Guangxi, the defeated Japanese army continued to be pursued and annihilated, inflicting heavy casualties. These are all important achievements in the past week. (21st dispatch)</p>

Over 1,500 new industries have been established, including cotton weaving, steel, wool, fuel, and minerals. In addition, political institutions are striving to improve, and promising young people are being used to replace old officials, and the government is full of vigorous atmosphere. The government is very confident in the victory of the war resistance. Even people from various countries in Chongqing are deeply convinced that China will win the final victory, because the new China can now be self-reliant and does not need to rely entirely on foreign aid. Dr. Monroe also said that he remembered more than ten years ago when Chairman Chiang asked him what China needed most. He replied that it was a firm and powerful leader. Now that he sees what Chairman Chiang has done, he cannot help but feel deeply grateful for China's success in obtaining such a person.

It is reported that the Norwegian army is still defending Hegra and has rejected the German proposal to negotiate surrender. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent on the Norwegian-Swedish border reports that British troops who landed in Namsos are currently consolidating their positions east of Namsos. The area is mountainous, with dense forests and deep snow, so the difficulties faced by the British troops cannot be ignored. The Canadian ski team accompanying the British troops will find their experience very valuable. According to a refugee who skied one hundred miles from Norway to the border, he saw many teams of Norwegian soldiers en route to Namsos to join the British forces. They are familiar with the terrain but are poorly armed and untrained in modern warfare. He saw some of them carrying only rifles and a small amount of ammunition. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden: According to reports, the great battle to capture Trondheim has matured in the Norway-Rørvik area. The Norwegian army at the Hegra Fortress, 20 kilometers northeast of Hell, has repelled the German offensive. The Norwegian army defending the fortress seems determined to defend it to the death. Although German planes bombed Hegra heavily yesterday, the Norwegian artillery continued to shell the German-occupied Vaernes airfield yesterday afternoon and in between. Last night, it was generally believed here that Allied troops had landed at three major locations in Norway: Namsos, Molde, and Åndalsnes, while Elverum and Hamar appeared to be firmly in German hands. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the active reinforcement of German troops in Trondheim, the Haitong News Agency has learned from reliable sources that a large number of fresh troops and a large amount of military supplies did land in the port yesterday according to plan.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden: It is reported that British troops have landed in Nattier, Norway, and have occupied a position of great strategic importance. From Nattier, there is a good road to Vagna Town, which is the terminus of the 90-mile railway from Oslo. Nattier also has a road to the railway between Oslo and Bergen. It is reported that the British troops have made contact with the Norwegian troops there. The Norwegian army is still holding the Dombås crossroads. The German side has repeatedly attempted to transport troops by plane to seize the area, but has not succeeded. It is reported that General Weiss, commander-in-chief of the German forces in Trondheim, is now making urgent preparations to meet the Allied forces' pincer attack from the north and south.

<h3 id="e22">Tensions Between Italy and Yugoslavia; France's Attitude Remains Unchanged; Prepared to Discuss All Outstanding Issues at Any Time, But Will Not Tolerate New Acts of Aggression; Italian Newspapers Boast of the Strength of the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here have stated that the international situation has had a positive impact on French domestic politics, as evidenced by the unanimous passage of the confidence vote in the Renault cabinet by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is reported that when Prime Minister Renault spoke to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate yesterday, he stated that the goals of the United Kingdom and France in southeastern Europe were to maintain peace, that is, to maintain a peace that would guarantee the independence of the Balkan countries. The meaning of this is that the two major democracies of Western Europe will not tolerate new acts of aggression in other parts of Europe. As for the Italian issue, Prime Minister Renault once said that around September 1st of last year, that is, before and after the outbreak of the European war, the French government repeatedly asked the Italian government if it was willing to conduct talks on various outstanding issues, but the Italian government did not respond. However, France's attitude remains unchanged and it is still prepared to contact Italy at any time. Regarding the relationship between France and Italy, the two sides concluded an agreement in 1935 to resolve all issues, including the Tunisian issue, "effectively." However, at the end of 1938, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano unilaterally declared it abolished. However, the Italian government has never explained how it intends to establish a balance of power between France and Italy. Although the so-called "natural desires" hinted at by various newspapers in Italy include Tunisia, Gibraltar, Corsica, and even Nice and Savoy, they are of no value from a diplomatic point of view. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to reliable diplomatic sources here, Prime Minister Mussolini has readied Italy's military apparatus and is preparing to conduct a small, bloodless raid in the Balkans. Foreign opinion here is that the Italian Prime Minister may dispatch heavily concentrated troops within days to advance north from Albania and occupy the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, so that the entire Upper Adriatic Sea will fall under Italian control. It is also reported that Mussolini will use the same trick that the Germans used to occupy Denmark. He believes that the Allies will not interfere, and that Yugoslavia will not resist. Some experts studying the Balkans say that Yugoslavia's non-resistance is hard to believe, while others say that Yugoslavia would rather endure Italy's tolerable demands than be destroyed by Germany. The reason for this view is that the activities of the Fascist Party in Yugoslavia are not interfered with, while the "fifth column" of the Nazi Party has been expelled from Yugoslavia. Informed sources believe that Mussolini's dispatch of troops to occupy the Dalmatian coast is a small part of his Mediterranean plan. This Mediterranean invasion plan is all-encompassing and wide-ranging. Mussolini has shelved it, or even abandoned it, because he fears that it will immediately lead to war between Britain and France against Italy. It is understood that if Italy follows the plan, it would have to use all its naval, land, and air forces to simultaneously occupy the Dalmatian coast, the Balearic Islands, British Gibraltar, and Greece, whose territorial integrity is guaranteed by the Allies, and then make Greece a protectorate of Italy, incorporate the Balearic Islands into Italy, and give Gibraltar to Spain as compensation. Mussolini would then hold on to the territory he had invaded and await the Allied counterattack. Mussolini then thought that his naval power could cope with the French fleet, but he also thought that the British Navy would assist the French Navy, but he did not know to what extent it could reinforce it. If the British fleet does not withdraw from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea, Mussolini will never dare to try it easily. Now, judging from Germany's invasion of Norway, the United Kingdom has no need to weaken the strength of the Mediterranean fleet, that is, the Germans have failed to implement their plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain. According to another report, the Mediterranean invasion plan was proposed to Mussolini by Germany. (International News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The "Zhara" newspaper here recently carried a telegram from a visitor stationed in Rome stating that the Italian newspapers have changed their tone, and the commentaries published today no longer attack the United Kingdom and France, but instead speak of Italy's "peaceful intentions." The reason for this is that the British side has hinted that it is prepared to make concessions to Italy. According to informed observers, the Italian newspapers are now adopting a "diplomatic" posture, waiting for the United Kingdom to put forward concrete proposals. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Milan: The Italian semi-official publication "International Relations" commented on the Allies' attempt to drag neutral countries into the war, saying that the Italian people have no illusions, and do not want to be caught off guard and become the object of others' cunning plans. They will wait for events to unfold with a calm attitude and deal with them with the utmost determination until they have won victory. The democracies are now praising the Italian government's peaceful policies, but the Italian people do not want to be praised. The Italian people have their own plans, and these plans will eventually be implemented. Italy will only rely on its military equipment, as an answer to the power politics of Europe. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: The famous Italian journalist Randa wrote in an editorial in the "Italian News" that with the support of the Air Force, the current Italian Navy is capable of defeating the British and French fleets in the Mediterranean. It is superficial and naive to think that because the Italian Navy's tonnage is smaller than the British Navy's, and even smaller than the total tonnage of the British and French navies, it will be completely destroyed in the Mediterranean within 24 hours. At present, there are not only surface warships, but also submarines and aircraft. Italy has more than 100 submarines, and its air force is also strong. The current European war has proven that the Air Force has changed the military strategy of naval warfare. A 200 kg bomb is four times more effective than a 500 kg shell. 52 aircraft can defeat a fleet of three battleships, five cruisers, six destroyers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier. This was the experience gained during the British naval exercises in 1934. The communication lines in the Mediterranean are easily attacked. The Italian Navy and Air Force are now in a position to destroy the enemy. (Haitong, 21st)</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland: The Basle Evening News correspondent in Berlin telegraphed that the governments of Germany and Italy have recently sent military delegations to each other. This is different from the ordinary talks conducted by the military authorities of the two countries, and is a military delegation with a special mission. The main issue to be discussed by both sides is probably the issue of munitions supply. In addition, German newspapers have deliberately created alarm, saying that the joint operations of the British and French fleets in the Norwegian waters have created a major crisis for Italy. For example, the German General Gazette stated that the sole goal of the British and French navies' actions in Northern Europe is to facilitate their activities in the Mediterranean. Italy's sphere of influence will become the target of their next attack. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The newspapers here continue to focus on the restoration of economic relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Among them, the News of the City of Zagreb stated, "Normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is an important factor in safeguarding peace in the Balkans. From an economic point of view, at a time when the European war is expanding, it is not easy for Yugoslavia to obtain the goods it needs. In the future, it is extremely important to be able to trade with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union can supply Yugoslavia with trucks, agricultural machinery, kerosene, coal, and other important goods. In short, the Soviet Union has decided to avoid getting involved in the current European war. Since the country is willing to do so, and both belligerent countries, the United Kingdom and France, and Germany, want to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet government." (Havas, 20th)</p>

Several German aircraft parked on the ground in Kristiansand were destroyed. In Stavanger, several bombs landed on the airfield's runway, causing explosions, and bombs also landed on the nearby seaplane base.

When His Majesty King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav were residing in a small town with absolutely no military targets, it was heavily bombed by German aircraft. I was present at the time and witnessed it. This shows that the German claim that this operation is only against political enemies is purely deceptive. In short, the facts of the German atrocities and illegal aggression we have suffered are obvious and cannot be concealed by any German fabrications." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Moscow - The Soviet trade union newspaper "Trud" published an article discussing Swedish iron ore, stating: "Even if the port of Narvik cannot be used as an export base, Swedish iron ore can still be transported to Germany as usual. Sweden ranks first in Europe in iron ore exports. The quality is excellent, with a high iron content, making it one of the best in the world. The amount exported to Germany accounts for three-quarters of Sweden's production, with only 17% exported to countries such as the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Although Swedish iron ore exports through the port of Narvik have decreased due to the impact of the war, the amount exported through the port of Luleå in the Bothnian Bay and various ports along the Baltic Sea has greatly increased. One of the reasons why Britain is expanding the war's threat to Scandinavia is to cut off the route for Swedish iron ore to Germany. If Scandinavia is drawn into the war, the routes to Luleå and other ports may not last long. Therefore, German and Swedish political circles are currently discussing the issue of transporting iron ore from Malmberget, Kiruna, and Gällivare through Luleå."

Last Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita's statement in Tokyo on Japan's policy toward the Dutch East Indies was used to review how the Hague government's policy would be if the European war expanded and foreign countries wanted to protect the Dutch East Indies.

<p>London - The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent stated that well-informed sources in London felt that there was no danger of the current situation in the Pacific being disturbed. Dutch officials also held the same view, believing that there was no reason for some people to predict that if the Netherlands were drawn into the war, the status quo of its East Indies territories would inevitably change. Both the Netherlands proper and the Dutch East Indies adhered to the same policy, which was to resist any attack to defend independence. The correspondent continued that the islands could undoubtedly be defended against any sudden attack, unless the opponent's military force was very strong. It was conceivable that it would be difficult for Japan to concentrate a large army there, far from its main base. At the same time, the stationing of most of the US Navy in the Pacific and the strong base of the British Pacific Fleet in Singapore could all be regarded as stabilizing factors. The consensus among all sectors of the Netherlands was that the best way to maintain the status quo was to adhere to the traditional policy of keeping the East Indies open and to defend themselves against all attacks under all circumstances. Therefore, all speculation about what would happen if Japan seized the Dutch East Indies was far from the truth. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>(Chongqing Airmail) In April of the 27th year, the Kuomintang held a temporary national congress and passed an outline of wartime education implementation plans at all levels, in which the twelfth key point stated, "The highest national academic review body should be established immediately to improve academic standards." Based on this plan, the Ministry of Education formulated and promulgated the Academic Review Committee Charter in July of the 28th year. According to the provisions of the charter, in addition to the Vice Minister and the Director of Higher Education as ex officio members, the committee was to have 25 appointed members, 12 of whom would be directly appointed by the Ministry, and 13 of whom would be appointed by the Ministry after being elected by the presidents of national colleges and universities. The Ministry immediately formulated election methods based on these provisions. According to Article 2 of the method, "Appointed members will be elected by the presidents of national colleges and universities using a secret ballot method, with two members elected from each of the liberal arts, science, and law disciplines, and one member elected from each of the agriculture, engineering, commerce, medicine, education, art, military, and physical education disciplines. Each discipline was assigned an quota. In December of the 28th year, the Ministry of Education printed ballots and distributed them to various colleges and universities for election. By January of this year, the ballots from various units had been sent to the Ministry one after another. The election results are as follows. Those with the most votes in each discipline, who should be appointed as members according to the election method, are: Liberal Arts: Feng Youlan, ten votes (Philosophy), Fu Sinian, six votes (History); Science, Zhu Kezhen, seven votes (Meteorology), Wu Youxun, six votes (Physics); Law, Zhou Gengsheng, ten votes (Law), Wang Shijie, six votes (Politics); Engineering, Mao Yisheng, seven votes (Civil Engineering); Commerce, Ma Yinchu, nine votes (Commerce); Medicine, Yan Fuqing, ten votes (Medicine); Art, Teng Gu, eight votes (Literature and Art). 2. For each discipline, those with the same number of votes should draw lots to determine one person to be further appointed. Education: Jiang Menglin and Liao Shicheng each received six votes; Agriculture: Xin Shuzhi and Zou Shuwen each received five votes; Military and Physical Education: Zhang Boling, Hao Gengsheng, Ma Yuehan, and Yuan Jili each received four votes. According to Article 3 of the Election Method for Appointed Members of the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, the personnel with the same votes in the second category of the above three disciplines should hold a lottery to determine the elected persons in each discipline. The Ministry of Education requested Wang Shijie, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, to supervise the lottery on March 20 of this year. The results of the lottery determined Jiang Menglin for Education, Zou Shuwen for Agriculture, and Ma Yuehan for Military and Physical Education. The elected personnel from the aforementioned disciplines will be appointed by the Minister of Education as members of the Academic Review Committee.</p>

<p>The Zhen Dan Cup small-scale soccer tournament saw clear weather yesterday, with a total of eleven matches played in the A and B divisions. The morning matches were all in the B division. In the afternoon, crowds flocked to the venue, filling every space in the one-dollar seats. The competition was exciting, but unfortunately, two disputes arose, marring the event. Fortunately, the organizers handled the situations appropriately. One incident occurred during the match between Wen She and Russian Overseas Chinese in the morning. Wen She player Ma Yuting acted barbarically, and in addition to being ejected by the referee on the spot, he was also banned from playing in two matches by the organizers. The other incident occurred in the final match between Samsung and Portuguese Merchants in the afternoon. Portuguese Merchants' goalkeeper M. Su Ruo insulted the audience and was also ejected from the field.</p>
<p>Samsung Draws with Portuguese Merchants</p>
<p>The final match between Samsung and Portuguese Merchants was a close contest. All of Portuguese Merchants' star players were present, creating a strong presence. Goalkeeper M. Su Ruo made countless saves. In the 18th minute, Samsung goalkeeper Dong Jincai mistakenly took four steps while holding the ball and was penalized with a free kick. Xue Erfo successfully converted the kick. Ten minutes later, Wu Shaotai broke through the center, scoring a goal for each team, ending the first half with a tied score. In the second half, Samsung controlled the attack. Yi Yanjin and Zhou Dan fired shots like bullets, but Su Ruo's performance was outstanding. Wu Shaotai missed a sure goal with an air ball. With only minutes left in the match, the Portuguese team was surrounded, and the audience cheered loudly. M. Su Ruo became angry and threw the ball violently at the crowd, causing public outrage. The game was halted for nearly fifteen minutes. As a result, referee Paris ruled that Su Ruo should leave the field and be replaced by Aquino, and then play was resumed. Samsung eventually drew with Portuguese Merchants, each scoring one goal.</p>

<p>Since obtaining the assistance of Donghua's Qin Bicao, Hu Hanwen, and Gao Baozheng, Ge Lian's strength has been greatly enhanced. In yesterday's match against Jingxiang, Bicao initially played as the right wing, demonstrating his defensive abilities. Before long, Gao Baozheng scored a goal with a header from a corner kick taken by Shi Yi, giving Ge Lian a 1-0 lead. After a prolonged battle, Liu Guocai of Jingxiang scored, tying the score at 1-1. The first half ended in a tie. In the second half, Bicao moved to goalkeeper and Zhuang Jifang played as center forward, making significant changes to Ge Lian's lineup. Their attack became even stronger, and Zhuang Jifang immediately made a significant contribution, giving Ge Lian the lead again. However, Liu Guocai eventually scored again, tying the score at 2-2. At that time, the atmosphere was intense. Ge Lian played a clever move, and Zhou Kecheng's final shot secured the victory, defeating Jingxiang 3-2.</p>

<h3 id="e52">A Fair Discussion on Capital Increase of Industrial and Commercial Enterprises <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Gaobo</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Recently, newspaper articles have frequently reported on announcements of general meetings of various limited companies. As a general rule, the discussions at this time are nothing more than (1) directors' reports on accounts, requesting approval from the general meeting of shareholders, (2) resolutions on the distribution of profits and dividends, and (3) re-election of directors and supervisors (refer to Articles 168, 136, 138, 152, and 154 of the Company Law). However, at the general meetings of various companies today, the issue of "capital increase" is often discussed. Capital increase is closely related to the credit and financial strength of a company. Therefore, our Company Law stipulates that it must be done through a "special resolution" (Article 186, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law). Moreover, after a company increases its capital, it also has an impact on national tax revenue (detailed later). This is related to national economic prosperity and should not be taken lightly. Recently, the trend of capital increase among Shanghai merchants (not limited to company organizations) has been very strong. Whether this is appropriate is subject to various justifications. However, due to different perspectives, those who discuss it are inevitably biased. Therefore, I offer a fair discussion, hoping to seek corrections from relevant government authorities, experts, and scholars, and hoping that the industrial and commercial sectors will give it careful consideration. I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>II. Reasons for Support and Opposition</p>
<p>There are various opinions on whether capital increase is appropriate. Here, I select the legitimate ones and analyze them into two categories:</p>
<p>A. Reasons for supporting capital increase:</p>
<p>(1) Reducing Tax Payable: According to our country's income tax and excess profits tax, the tax rates are determined by the ratio of income to capital. Therefore, two companies with different capital amounts but the same income amount (net profit) still have different tax amounts. Companies with larger capital pay less tax, and companies with smaller capital pay more tax. If a company's capital is small, but its surplus, reserves, and secret or discretionary public reserves are substantial, then the actual capital of the two companies is almost the same. It can be seen that the different tax payments are clearly unfair. Therefore, companies with smaller capital may wish to transfer their public reserves, etc., into capital to avoid this kind of loss. Therefore, capital increase cannot be opposed.</p>
<p>(2) High Costs Require Urgent Capital Increase: Prices are soaring, costs are high, and the original capital is insufficient for turnover. Therefore, capital increase is needed to seek business development.</p>
<p>(3) Stopping Dividend Payments to Increase Utility: Recently, due to the special market conditions, this year's profits have been exceptionally high. After distribution to shareholders, they often lead to wasteful spending. If dividend payments are stopped (or reduced) and converted into funds for business expansion, it is naturally very appropriate. Moreover, sufficient capital will lead to more future profits. Therefore, from the perspective of absolute numerical value, it can increase national tax revenue. Capital increase can certainly be agreed upon.</p>
<p>B. Reasons for opposing capital increase:</p>
<p>(1) Increasing Capital is Tantamount to Tax Evasion: This can be understood by referring to point one in section A.</p>
<p>(2) Surplus Funds Encourage Speculation: After funds are abundant, at a time when prices are constantly changing and uncertain, it is enough to encourage speculation and fluctuate price increases. Therefore, capital increase indirectly affects people's livelihood and is not appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) Capital Increase Inhibits the Internal Transfer of Funds: Shanghai's local environment is special. From a long-term perspective, funds should be transferred internally to consolidate inland finance and develop inland industries. Therefore, capital increase by Shanghai merchants is not appropriate.</p>
<p>III. Author's Fair Discussion</p>
<p>The above reasons for and against are equally strong. However, we should have a supreme principle as the basis for fair discussion. What is the principle? That is, the motivation for capital increase. Any capital increase intended for tax evasion or for non-business speculation is unacceptable. Any capital increase that seeks capital turnover for legitimate business needs is permissible. This principle may be too abstract. Now, let's discuss the methods of capital increase separately.</p>
<p>There are three ways to increase capital: actual capital increase, transfer capital increase, and passive capital increase. Their complexity varies. A separate discussion follows:</p>
<p>A. Actual Capital Increase: Actual capital increase is the real increase of funds in practice. In other words, it refers to the real receipt of cash or other assets to increase capital. For those who increase capital in this way, we generally cannot easily oppose it on the grounds of "tax evasion." Since there is an actual capital increase, the actual invested assets are indeed higher than in the previous year. How can it be falsely accused of tax evasion? However, I believe that the increase should be within a considerable proportion, that is, it should be proportional to the recent trend of business growth and adapt to the increase in the price index. If it exceeds this limit greatly, it is obvious that there is a suspicion of concurrently engaging in speculation, hoping for illegitimate profits, which is not something we can condone.</p>
<p>B. Transfer Capital Increase: Transfer capital increase does not actually increase funds; it only transfers surplus, etc., to capital. Therefore, the company's capital net worth (the remaining amount after deducting liabilities from assets) does not increase. Whether transfer capital increase is appropriate depends on the different transfer methods. Now, let's briefly discuss the main points.</p>
<p>(1) Transferring Discretionary Public Reserves and Reserves to Capital: Discretionary public reserves refer to public reserves other than statutory public reserves, and various reserves refer to reserves that have no external contractual relationship. The result of transferring them to capital does not increase the net worth of the capital, and this capital has actually been used in the enterprise in the past. Therefore, accountants often call it "reinvestment of net profit." Its transfer to capital is still a reinvestment of net profit, but it is legally considered capital. There is absolutely no increase or decrease in the company's financial strength, fund utilization, or profitability (if the company returns cash to some shareholders who are unwilling to transfer surplus to share capital, it will reduce the net worth of the capital). It can be seen that the purpose of its capital increase is obviously not legitimate, and there is no doubt that it is for tax evasion. Therefore, how can this kind of capital increase be supported? The inferiority of the motivation and the shamelessness of the means are self-evident.</p>
<p>(2) Transferring Current Year's Surplus to Capital: Recently, due to the special environment and abnormal price fluctuations, industrial and commercial enterprises have made huge profits in the 28th year of the Republic. Some manufacturers have bonuses of up to 100 months, and the thickness of their profits is amazing. Therefore, ambitious entrepreneurs are thinking of transferring the current year's surplus (except for the statutory tax payment and reserve appropriation) to capital and have legitimate reasons to defend it (see section II of this article). Whether this method can be agreed upon, in my humble opinion, cannot be determined on one side. It should be determined by whether the company really needs funds. If the company distributes the surplus to shareholders and expects to suffer from insufficient capital turnover this year, and the expansion of the business will be restricted, it may wish to transfer it to capital in accordance with the law to meet the needs. When the profit differs too much from the past, even if all accounting techniques are used to handle it prudently (this is an accounting issue. I have written an article on "Conservatism in Accounting," published in the second issue of the Fudan University Accounting Society Journal, which can be consulted), it is difficult to retain it, and it is easy to be criticized by shareholders. Therefore, it is only possible to be open and honest and make a proposal for capital increase. If the company does not need to increase funds, then transferring to capital is not appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) Capitalizing Revaluation Appreciation of Assets and Publicizing Secret Surplus: In general, enterprises often adopt prudent methods in accounting, underestimating fixed assets or setting up secret surplus invisibly through various methods. Now, fixed assets are valued by type (it must be estimated high), and secret surplus is made public, and the appreciation part is transferred to capital. Today, prices are rising sharply. If fixed assets are revalued according to the accounting theory of replacement cost, the appreciation amount will be very alarming. Today's price increase is due to the war and is quite different from the natural trend of gradual increase on weekdays. Therefore, whether the revaluation of fixed assets today is appropriate in economic accounting theory seems to be questionable. Therefore, it is also quite questionable to transfer asset valuation appreciation to capital, and we dare not condone it. Secret surplus is actually the undistributed surplus of previous years, so it can be referred to as described in the first type of transfer capital increase. However, the setting of secret surplus often lacks accurate calculation, so it is often more difficult to measure when it is made public. If it is inadvertently overestimated, the harm will be great, so it should be doubly cautious.</p>
<p>C. Passive Capital Increase: Passive capital increase is to reduce debt to increase capital. In other words, the company's creditors transfer their claims (that is, the company's debt) to shares. Therefore, it is also the nature of transfer capital increase. However, the result of passive capital increase can increase the net worth of capital, so I do not make it one of the transfer capital increase to show this biggest difference. Whether passive capital increase is appropriate should be judged by whether this debt is necessary. If this debt is necessary for business and is indispensable to maintain or expand business, then it is justifiable to simply transfer it to capital. On the contrary, if this debt is not necessary for business and can be repaid, but it is transferred to capital, the motivation is suspected, and the capital increase may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>The above points are nothing more than an elucidation of the highest principle, that is, any capital increase intended for tax evasion or for non-business speculation is unacceptable. Any capital increase that seeks capital turnover for legitimate business needs is permissible. Although the discussion is based on limited companies, other business organizations have simpler capital increase methods, so the previous discussion can be applied by analogy without separate explanation. Whether the fair discussion is unbiased and whether the argument is free from error, I hope that readers will correct it.</p>

<p>The living conditions of Japanese workers under malignant inflation are too miserable. Therefore, no matter how their ruling class strengthens its pressure, labor disputes are rising day by day. Looking at the survey statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Social Affairs Bureau, the number of disputes and participants in the first eleven months of last year has doubled compared with the same period of the previous year. As shown in the table: 1939 1938 Number of disputes: 1,009 955 Number of participants: 83,789 49,202</p>

<h3 id="e54">A Word to the Financial Community in Shanghai <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Renyi</p>
<p>Prices in Shanghai are soaring, setting an unprecedented record. In particular, daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal balls are the worst. Recently, I read the Municipal Council's published price index, which is several times higher than before the war. A few skilled businessmen know how to use this extraordinary period to speculate, hoard, and monopolize, making huge profits and rejoicing. However, the vast majority of law-abiding salaried class are severely oppressed by prices and feel that their income cannot cover their expenses, causing economic panic. The reason for this is that the increase in salaries is limited, and the rise in prices is endless. It is difficult for general household income and expenditure to balance, causing concern. The concession authorities, in view of this, have already set price limits for these daily necessities and tried to curb the price increase in order to relieve the people's difficulties. However, general merchants are eager for profit and disregard the people's livelihood, reversing their positions and designing to avoid price limits, and have not been able to comply. For example, the price limit for rice has been raised from 20 yuan to 30 yuan, and then to 40 yuan, following the market price. It has not been heard that the limit has achieved much effect. Recently, the concession authorities have ordered all stores to mark the prices of retail daily necessities, in order to encourage the stores to automatically suppress and flatten prices. The promulgation of this measure shows the authorities' deep concern for the people and their desire to save the people from the water and fire.</p>
<p>There are many commentators on curbing the rise in prices! However, the points of their arguments are all to directly restrict merchants from hoarding and to dredge the sources of production areas. However, we must know that relying solely on the authority of the authorities to restrict hoarding may not be very effective. As for dredging the sources of production areas, the Shanghai concession is in fact surrounded by the occupied area. Most of the daily necessities are supplied by the occupied area, which cannot be dredged by the power of our government and the concession authorities. Although the recent action of the People's Food Adjustment Committee to raise funds to purchase foreign rice can indeed prevent the rice price from continuing to rise for a while, it is indeed a good policy. However, there seems to be no way to dredge the sources of other goods. I think that the way to suppress and flatten prices, in addition to the above methods, if economic power can be used to implement control, the effect may be more significant. Financial resources are the lifeblood of business. If the financial community can cooperate fully, handle the acceptance of mortgages carefully, stipulate a method of mortgage release separately, and limit its scope, then the financial resources of ordinary merchants are ultimately limited, and the abuse of speculation and manipulation can be expected to be considerably curbed. According to the statistics published in the recent newspaper, the financial community in Shanghai has funds of 200 billion yuan. Various Chinese and foreign banks have always been leaders in the business world. Now that they have such a huge amount of funds, if they can set an example and not engage in hoarding and speculation, and help the authorities to strictly prevent speculators from using their funds for hoarding, then the price increase in Shanghai may be considerably curbed! Now, I will describe my views below for the reference of the financial community in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Market Knowledge Consultant Column - Announcement <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>We have recently received many market knowledge questions, which will be answered together in the next issue of this publication. We acknowledge your interest and thank you in advance.</p>
<p>(1) Do Not Provide Foreign Exchange Margin Loans: Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have a significant impact on commodity prices! At first glance, foreign exchange rates seem to only affect the prices of foreign goods. We might think that if we are determined not to use foreign goods, we can avoid its influence. However, anyone with a basic understanding of economics knows that this is not the case. Foreign exchange rates are closely related to the prices of all goods, especially those involved in international trade! Take tea and eggs, for example... The annual export volume of these items is substantial. Businesses in this sector will undoubtedly export large quantities during times of rapid foreign exchange depreciation to profit from exchange rate differences. At the same time, the prices of these goods sold domestically will also rise! Even for domestic goods unrelated to international trade, those who usually admire imported goods will now, due to economic constraints, have to lower their standards and buy domestic goods as substitutes. The market prices of domestic goods will naturally rise as well. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are indeed closely related to changes in commodity prices. If we can control the exchange rate, commodity prices will naturally stabilize! Although the government has long implemented controls on foreign exchange rates, the special environment in Shanghai makes it difficult to enforce the law, and the black market still manipulates it. Therefore, what we want to study is how to suppress and stabilize the exchange rate. If banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, as well as major foreign banks such as HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile Bank, all stop providing foreign exchange margin loans (i.e., do not provide margin loans for foreign exchange bills and foreign currency banknotes), then merchants who usually speculate in foreign exchange will only be able to purchase foreign exchange with their own capital. This would reduce the demand for foreign exchange, and its price would naturally fall, causing commodity prices to decline as well. HSBC once announced that it would no longer provide margin loans for gold and foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market immediately weakened. This shows that the actions of one bank alone can significantly affect the foreign exchange market. If all Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai uniformly stop providing foreign exchange margin loans and work together to control the situation, it will be easier to suppress and stabilize the exchange rate, and commodity prices will gradually become more stable!</p>
<p>(2) Do Not Provide Long-Term Margin Loans for Essential Daily Necessities: …If all Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai do not provide long-term margin loans for essential daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal briquettes, businesses in these sectors, due to limited financial resources, will find it difficult to hoard goods for long periods and monopolize the market. The decline in their market prices will naturally be gradually achieved.</p>
<p>(3) Increase Warehouse Rental Rates: – Most of the larger banks in Shanghai have their own warehouses to benefit customers. According to common practice, borrowers take out margin loans from banks using commodities as collateral and store the commodities in the bank's warehouses while waiting for favorable prices to sell. Banks, on the other hand, welcome borrowers to store collateral in their own warehouses because external margin loans are unreliable. If banks stipulate higher warehouse rental rates and limit rental periods for daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal briquettes, merchants will not be able to hoard goods! Merchants hoard goods only as a temporary expedient and will not rent additional space specifically for this purpose. Therefore, merchants will not hoard goods if we treat bank warehouses as a key point. If banks announce higher warehouse rental rates and limit rental periods, merchants who want to hoard and speculate will inevitably hesitate. This is also a way to suppress commodity prices.</p>
<p>If Shanghai banks can lead by example, refrain from speculation, earnestly guide the real economy, and study and implement the above-mentioned methods to reduce margin loans for daily necessities and foreign exchange as much as possible within their capabilities and increase warehouse rental rates, it may be possible to achieve a significant effect on suppressing commodity prices. As for investment strategies, we hope that all banks can consider using their surplus funds to invest in construction projects in the southwestern provinces. This will prevent large amounts of capital from being idled and generate considerable profits, while also assisting the government in completing its major anti-Japanese war construction plan. This is what we deeply hope for!</p>
<h3 id="e56">Cost Estimate for Ten-Pound Coarse Cloth <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>Most Chinese-owned textile factories have unfortunately been destroyed in the war, and those that have miraculously survived have been seized by the enemy! Since the Chinese army withdrew from "Greater Shanghai," Shanghai has been recognized as an isolated island, fortunate enough to enjoy a distorted prosperity, a paradise for adventurers? Merchants who are skilled at speculation will not easily let this opportunity pass. Therefore, after the war, "small textile factories" in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Most of them weave coarse cloth (grey fabric), such as nine-pound, ten-pound, eleven-pound, twelve-pound, and thirteen-pound coarse cloths, fine plain cloths, and twelve-pound coarse and fine twills. The cost calculation is generally based on the ten-pound coarse plain cloth as the standard. Before the war, the raw material cost (yarn cost) of one bolt of ten-pound coarse plain cloth was only about four yuan and forty cents, but now it costs about sixteen yuan! As for the production cost (manufacturing cost, management cost, unified tax, etc.) per bolt, it was no more than one yuan and twelve cents before the war, but now it costs at least three to four yuan! Among these, the increase in materials, electricity, and coal is the most severe! In terms of market prices, one bolt of ten-pound coarse plain cloth sold for about six yuan before the war, but now it must sell for twenty-two yuan and fifty cents. The selling price is almost three times higher than before the war. How can ordinary people afford it? The following is a list of the cost estimates for ten-pound cloth before and after the war, along with the percentage increase:</p>
<p>The raw material (yarn cost) of the above-mentioned ten-pound coarse plain cloth is generally made of ten-count yarn for the warp and twelve-count yarn for the weft. In 1936, the selling price of ten-count coarse yarn was no more than 180 yuan (per piece), and the selling price of twelve-count coarse yarn was only 190 yuan. So, after removing the selling price of ten-count yarn from a piece of yarn weighing 420 pounds (Sima weight), each pound only cost 0.485 yuan. And after removing the selling price of twelve-count yarn, each pound only cost 0.4524 yuan. The average was only 0.440 yuan (per pound of yarn cost), right? Even if ten pounds of yarn were used (in terms of engineering, ten-pound coarse plain cloth generally uses nine and a half pounds of yarn, and at most ten pounds. After removing half a pound of by-products, the pure weaving yarn is still nine and a half pounds, right? But for the sake of calculating yarn costs, it must be calculated as ten pounds), a yarn cost of four yuan and forty cents was enough. But now, a piece of ten-count yarn costs 680 yuan, which is equivalent to 1.62 yuan per pound. A piece of twelve-count yarn costs 710 yuan, which is equivalent to 1.69 yuan per pound. The average calculation is 1.655 yuan per pound. Multiplying this by nine and a half pounds of yarn, isn't the cost (per bolt of yarn) 15 yuan and 67 cents? According to the above table, the total cost of one bolt of ten-pound coarse plain cloth (now) is 19.76 yuan, and the market price is 22.50 yuan. Adding the two cents per bolt of by-products (scraps) produced, the total is 22.70 yuan. After deducting the cost of 19.76 yuan, the factory's profit per bolt is as high as 2.94 yuan! (Before the war, it was only a small profit, at most six or seven cents.) If the daily and nightly production capacity is 1,000 bolts, wouldn't the daily net profit be 2,940 yuan? Taking a step back, even if the production volume of a small textile factory is as little as 100 bolts, there is still a profit of nearly 300 yuan a day, which is also very considerable, right? What needs to be pointed out here is that Japanese yarn has now reached parity with domestic yarn (and sometimes even exceeds the price of domestic yarn). There are no longer any cheap goods! Therefore, those profiteering manufacturers who used to buy Japanese yarn are now switching to purchasing domestic yarn as raw materials because the yarn costs are similar (Japanese yarn and "domestic yarn"), and they are afraid of problems in the domestic sales market. This is good news! It's also a good phenomenon! I hope it can remain so permanently!</p>
<p>Note: The yarn used for one ten-pound coarse plain cloth (per bolt) is 9.50 pounds, and the starch is 1.50 pounds, for a total weight of 11 pounds. As for the cloth weight, it is 10.50 pounds, and the by-product is 0.50 pounds (half a pound, the total is also 11 pounds, those who read this should know.")</p>

<h3 id="e58">Diao Qing Rises by One Yuan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the Netherlands yesterday, the sugar market has rebounded by 1 cent. The C.I.F.K.G. is valued at 9.00 Dutch guilders. The local association's market price is tight. Spot 24 coarse white, 65 yuan at this warehouse, up 2 cents. No change in new goods at external warehouses, at 64 yuan and 65 to 7 cents, old goods 64 yuan and 50 cents, transit 51 yuan and 40 cents. Taikoo Che Bai B Kashgar warehouse goods continue to rise to 71 yuan and 6 cents, old goods 71 yuan and 2 cents, the rest as before. H Mark Che Chi new goods 51 yuan, up 5 cents, old goods 50 yuan. Spot Dutch red is still 53 yuan and 75 cents, transit 45 yuan. The goods from the Diao Qing Zhou Japanese ship of Guotang have opened more than 100 packages, 51 yuan, up 1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Quanzhou Round Costs are High <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Quanzhou Pao Yuan, it is heard that the Xinxiangtai ship will arrive soon, with a small number of shipments. According to a letter from a customer, the cost of this top round must be 140 yuan per dan, which is expensive and unprecedented. According to the Shanghai market, it is currently difficult to reach.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Lily Slice Costs are High <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>New lily slices are expected to be sampled by the end of May. Because of the transition between new and old, production and storage are scarce, and the price is also high. The cost is more than 40 yuan, but the Shanghai market is still difficult to see good. It is heard that the Guangzhou gang handled a batch of ordinary goods yesterday for 31 to 32 yuan. If the high-end is 435 yuan, the goods are extremely scarce, so customers with a little stock are unwilling to sell cheaply and look forward to a firm price.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Red Qians Fall by Six or Seven Yuan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Red-skinned Qianshi, also known as Yaoqian, has recently seen a surge in sources from Jiangbei, and the underlying inventory is quite abundant, but the forward market is sluggish, so the market is downstream. It is heard that the transaction yesterday fell by six or seven yuan, but some customers are losing money, so the future sources will be reduced, and the overall trend is expected to bottom out.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Domestically Produced Xiawei is Lacking <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Domestically produced shrimp tails, such as Tianjin, Yantai, Wenzhou, and Jiangbei, are all lacking in supply, so transactions are quiet. The market inventory is low, and the trend is also flat. This is because inferior goods are full, and street sales are not lacking. It is heard that the current market price of Yuanwei is 240 yuan to 250 yuan, and Bianwei is 290 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Pepper Market Turns Better <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of pepper is continuous, and the forward market is said to be bad. The underlying inventory of black pepper is rare, and the current market price of black pepper is 102 yuan, which is 4 yuan higher than before. Wen Dao white pepper is still 175 yuan, and Dutch goods are 165 yuan, and the trend is also stable.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Paper-Wrapped Company Iron - Delivery is Smooth <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Paper-wrapped Company Iron is a new product from the United States. It has not been sold in Shanghai for a long time, and it has been loved by manufacturers. The reason is that it is excellent in material and dazzling in color, and the price is slightly higher than Company Iron, but it is much lower than tinplate. Therefore, can factories, toy factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, thermos factories, and biscuit companies have a lot of purchases, especially can factories. It is heard that in the past two days, the transaction volume in the market was as high as five or six hundred boxes, so the industry is thinking of keeping up with its strength. In addition, there are no goods from Europe these days, even if there are one or two, they have been intercepted on the way, so the arrival of goods in Shanghai is very thin. Although the United States is not within the scope of the European war, the recent situation in the Pacific is tight, transportation will be more difficult, and sources will be sharply reduced, so the inventory in Shanghai is in danger of imbalance between supply and demand, and the asking price is getting higher and higher. The current market price is 170 yuan per box (2 bundles calculated at 200 pounds), which is 5 yuan better than before.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Coal Briquettes Continue to Add Seven Yuan - Seven Yuan and Forty Cents Per Dan <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In terms of coal briquettes, due to the soaring price of raw material Hongji No. 2 chips (150 yuan per ton), which is related to the cost, the industry association has decided that the Yitai Xing, Nanyang, and Guohua coal briquettes will continue to add 7 yuan from now on. The price is 135 yuan per ton by car, 139 yuan for delivery, 18 yuan and 5 cents per basket at the door retail, and 7 yuan and 4 cents per 100 city catties, including delivery costs.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Inside Story of Coal Merchants' Manipulation <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The coal market has recently been affected by the expansion of the European war. Generally, coal merchants say that the inventory in the city is weak, and the Norwegian delivery of transported goods has been reported to be detained, and the source will be cut off. Under this name, various grades of Yanbai coal have been raised to 30 or 40 yuan per ton in one week. Those who hoard goods still want to see good, hold back and do not release, and on the other hand, they take the opportunity to spread rumors to shake people's hearts. For example, a certain bank restricts the dismantling of the same industry, each household is limited to two baskets, making people panic, and the dark price is rising day by day. In fact, there are still more than 10,000 tons of Hongji white coal in its warehouse, hoarding and manipulating the market. If it is afraid of being criticized, it urges customers to come and deliver the goods quickly. To explore its content, this so-called warehouse list stopped selling two months ago, and it is impossible to know why it made this statement. It is nothing more than to make the outside world unclear about the truth, confusing the news. Other white coals such as Haifeng Mark Kaibao, bituminous coal such as Indian Calcutta, Borneo, Kaiping, etc., are stocked in each warehouse, no less than 100,000 tons, and a certain side's coal is not included, which is enough for the city to supply for three months. What is the so-called weak inventory? As for the obstruction of transportation and the disconnection of sources, it is even more nonsense. Because in addition to Norway and Denmark, there are also British-owned Maler Wheels, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and Dala Wheels, etc., accounting for more than 70%, which is enough to supply. Even those who can arrive within this week have as many as 35,000 tons. In May, there have been several orders, so in the shortest period, if there are no unexpected changes, the source of goods will not be a problem. However, at present, the first order is not reduced, the US dollar hovers at 6 yuan, the cost of foreign coal has not changed, and the market price is rising from it, nothing more than to "fish in troubled waters," so it is a dangerous word, frightening the public. If the European war is slightly eased, the market price will fall by itself. It is seen that general speculators "climb high and fall hard." It is very dangerous. I hope that all circles will deal with it calmly, adapt to changes, do not rashly advance, so as to avoid "carrying a stone slab and pressing on your feet," wanting to be cheap but suffering a loss.

<h3 id="e67">Sexual Health - Reasonable Conditioning and Effective Treatment for Middle-Aged Kidney Deficiency and Brain Weakness <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Why do middle-aged people develop symptoms such as kidney deficiency and brain weakness? In short, this is due to the excessive consumption of essence and blood during youth. If you indulge in lust and debauchery in your youth, or have bad habits of masturbation, the above two symptoms will be unavoidable in middle age. In addition, poor environment, excessive use of the brain, and excessive labor will also cause huge consumption of physical strength, and the above two symptoms will also occur after middle age. The method of treatment lies in reasonable conditioning, do not work too hard, sexual life should also be restrained, take in nutritious food, pay attention to exercise, do not smoke alcohol and other products. Then engage in sperm enhancement and blood replenishing therapy to achieve the purpose of rejuvenation and restore youthful vitality.</p>
<p>The method of rejuvenation was prevalent in ancient times, but although the ancients sought it day and night, they still could not get what they wanted. Why is this? This is nothing more than the ancients being too focused on superstition and unwilling to study it based on scientific principles.</p>
<p>Now, based on the facts of many experiments with scientific basis, it is believed that the method of immortality must use endocrinology knowledge to be more prosperous. Because modern endocrinology can only alleviate aging, scholars still need to work hard to return to childhood.</p>
<p>The disease of kidney deficiency and brain weakness in middle-aged people is indeed caused by premature aging. The treatment method must be to take male "Boutikang," a majestic animal endocrine preparation invented by Dr. Mullin in Germany, because "Boutikang" is completely extracted from the sperm of chimpanzees, cattle, sheep, stags, and seals. Suppose that if you suffer from kidney deficiency, brain weakness, etc. due to overwork or debauchery, and then invest in "Boutikang," you will immediately feel the prosperity of sexuality, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, waist back pain and other symptoms will be cured in a few days.</p>
<p>In addition to the testicular essence of the kind, "Boutikang" also contains brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-nourishing calcium, which can cure any part of the body that is weak. If a person under the age of 40 feels insufficient sperm, pale complexion, neurasthenia, thin muscles, and lack of energy in doing things, it is a clear sign of premature aging, then taking "Boutikang" internally is the most reasonable treatment method, and its female use has the effect of regulating menstruation and seeding, and treating anemia and premature aging is especially symptomatic.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Case of Cured Spermatorrhea <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wan Naiqiang, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>The patient, Zhao Changming, is 24 years old and from Shandong. (Self-reported) - When he was 16 years old, when his love was just beginning, countless erotic books and paintings were collected and appreciated early and late, and even erotic thoughts were frequent day and night. Fortunately, he was as timid as a mouse and dared not openly play outside. Later, he was led by bad friends, and he became addicted to self-pleasuring, because the habit became natural, almost every night, he would commit it once, and soon felt dazed, and had more dreams. After the age of 21, he suddenly felt gaunt, insufficient spirit, at that time, he had a little medical knowledge, knowing that it must endanger the whole body, resolutely abstained, but spermatorrhea has been frequent and incessant, first only four or five days a month, and later reached about ten times. Because I have been unemployed for a long time, I have no money to see a doctor, which has led to letting it go untreated, and the disease has increased. Recently, the memory is weak, the eyes are dizzy, the waist back is painful, and the face development has been blocked. Recently, because the wedding date is approaching, I beg for treatment. (Treatment process) - First, "Naimian" was used in conjunction with electrotherapy to restore the prosperity of sexual nerves. After three months of treatment, spermatorrhea disappeared, the body recovered, the development was sufficient, and the weight also increased by 12 pounds, and there is a tendency to continue to gain weight.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Gonorrhea Lecture - Failure of Gonorrhea Treatment with Inferior Drugs <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan said</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Using compulsory methods to subdue the object you want to subdue will cause problems in 19 out of 10 cases. Because nothing in the world can be suppressed by violent force. Even if it is subdued for a while, it will eventually erupt one day. In my 20 years of experience, most of the patients who unfortunately suffer from gonorrhea are not originally stubborn roots of the disease. However, the reason why all kinds of symptoms eventually change is that they are caused by compulsory drugs. Among the various complications of gonorrhea, prostatitis, orchitis, and arthritis are the most common. These complications are mostly caused by inferior industries. And poor local surgery is also more likely to turn into such terrible complications. You must know that the urethra is composed of the corpus cavernosum. And it is rich in blood vessels. If gonorrhea has entered the corpus cavernosum from the mucosa of the posterior urethra, then the general over-the-counter drugs on the market that advocate film-penetrating sterilization, or use local washing methods, want to completely eliminate all the gonorrhea in the blood and the corpus cavernosum, which is tantamount to fishing for the moon in the water, which is hoped for but cannot be reached. And because these treatments are useless and harmful. It is advisable to stop these treatments as soon as possible. If you are lost and do not know how to return, then this kind of patient will inevitably suffer thousands of changes. It is even more difficult to clean up.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is best to treat it with excellent scientific methods. Only then can the purpose of full recovery be achieved. To achieve this goal, the gonorrhea panacea "Kerlinong" (available at China-UK Pharmacy) is the most ideal internal medicine for gonorrhea patients. Because "Kerlinong" has the effect of stimulating the body's cells to fight gonorrhea. So that gonorrhea has no way to escape. At the same time, based on my experience, I also use German inductive static electricity therapy and German anti-gonorrhea serum as a supplement, so that all new and old gonorrhea can be completely cured. Absolutely do not disappoint the patient. Because these treatments have extremely thorough and gentle sterilization power. It is different from the compulsory treatment of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Clinic hours: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. 20 consultations are sent out every day, and only 5 cents of the consultation fee is charged for each number, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexual Diseases" is given away.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Modern Medicine: Ironclad Facts - Gonorrhea Drug Experiment <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Many old gonorrhea treatments have been proven ineffective by modern expert physicians and patients. Therefore, research into new treatments is flourishing within the entire medical community. Scholars are working diligently, exhausting countless efforts and brainpower, and finally, a truth for treating gonorrhea was discovered in a test tube, which shocked the medical world. It is widely regarded as the greatest achievement in the treatment of gonorrhea. At that time, I was studying medicine in America, focusing on research and extensively reading medical journals published in Europe and America. I learned that the new method is based on the latest science, extracting pure pigments and protein complexes, combined with other mild but powerful antibacterial chemicals, to create a rinsing solution. When this solution is used to soak gonococci, the gonococci are quickly killed.</p>
<p>Many scholars, such as Dr. Jauregg (1912), R. Kraug (1914, 1717), and R. Schmidt (1916), all university professors and specialists in gonorrhea, have repeatedly tested the agent and proved its great effectiveness. Gonococci cultured on agar slants in test tubes are usually very active and lively. However, once this drug solution is injected into the test tube, all the gonococci immediately die. Later, Dr. Peter further improved the method by using precise sterilization procedures to make a oral medicine called "Kelinong" (available at the China-England Dispensary) from pure yellow pigment and specially prepared protein complexes, opening a new era in the treatment of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>This medicine has the function of radically curing all types of gonorrhea in men and women, whether acute or chronic, such as acute and chronic balanitis, prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis in men, vulvitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, oophoritis, gonorrheal leukorrhea in women. Its effectiveness is swift and accurate, and its reputation has long been established. For women with gonorrheal leukorrhea, "Carters vaginal suppositories" can be used externally as suppositories. Insert one tablet into the vagina every night before going to bed and wash it away the next morning. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" externally to wash the urethra according to the diagram and instructions, secretly treating themselves at home. The speed of effectiveness will exceed expectations and may be even better than treatment at a general doctor's office. This is the conclusion I have reached from my clinical experience over the past decade. (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" is sold at both Taihe Chinese and Western Drugstores)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Secret for Cough Relief and Lung Treatment - Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Whether in traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, cough is considered a difficult condition to treat. Therefore, lung diseases are far more common than any other infectious disease, and their mortality rate is truly alarming. Therefore, people should not regard a cough caused by a cold as a minor ailment and neglect treatment. If, unfortunately, a cough becomes a lung disease due to neglect, the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as general doctors say. As long as one takes care of their health and receives proper treatment, there is nothing mysterious about it. Based on my experience, the medicine "Bufei Na'er" has a very effective cough-relieving and lung-curing effect. Even in the second or third stage of hemoptysis, taking this medicine can achieve a complete cure. However, during the recovery period, one should rest quietly, avoid labor, and consume nutritious foods. Then the disease can be more easily cured. These are the essential conditions for curing pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Frederick Maze, Defends Customs Rights, Resolves Not to Interact with "Customs Administration" - British and American Officials and Businessmen Will Provide Strong Support <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources from well-informed foreigners, the diplomatic authorities of Britain, America, and other third countries in Shanghai, as well as influential businessmen, are paying serious attention to the issue of the Jianghai Customs. It is said that the "Customs Administration" of the Nanjing regime, fearing Zhang Sumin's so-called "assumption of office," sent an informal document to the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General of Customs on Hed Road in Shanghai, notifying the Inspector General, Mr. Frederick Maze.</p>
<p>The intention is clearly visible.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Mr. Maze has been stationed in Shanghai, and all customs offices throughout the country are under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General. In the past, the Japanese puppet regime, with its watchful eyes, focused all its attention on the Jianghai Customs but never interacted with the Inspector General. Although Zhang Sumin notified his so-called "assumption of office" with an informal "official document" this time, his significant ambition to covet the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General and undermine customs rights is clearly evident.</p>
<p>Customs Inspector Maze ignored it.</p>
<p>If the Inspectorate General were unfortunately to undergo any changes, it would not only affect the trade of Britain, America, and other third countries with China but also have a significant impact on the foreign debt secured by customs revenue. Therefore, it has aroused great concern among officials and businessmen from third countries. However, Inspector General Frederick Maze ignored this document and refused to acknowledge it. Historical circumstances of the Jianghai Customs have undergone many changes, and its negotiating counterpart has always been the Japanese side. Therefore, foreign businessmen here believe that in order to protect their original rights and interests in trade with China, the governments of Britain, America, and other countries should promptly provide strong support to Inspector General Frederick Maze to prepare for future developments.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The New French Military Commander Has Already Assumed Office <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>After Colonel Gascoigne, the former commander of the French garrison, who had a long and distinguished military career, was recalled to his country, the new garrison commander, Major-General Hélouis, officially took office on the 17th. His background is as follows: Major-General Hélouis is 49 years old, born on April 11, 1891. He joined the army on October 8, 1912. When the European War broke out in 1914, Major-General Hélouis served in the 23rd Regiment of the Albert Light Infantry. Not long after fighting,</p>
<p>he was slightly injured.</p>
<p>In 1914, he was appointed Second Lieutenant and platoon leader, and then promoted to company commander. He fought in various places in Lorraine and Belgium. At the beginning of 1915, he was injured for the second time and received commendation from the division headquarters. In May of the same year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and participated in battles in "Verdun," "Somme," and Champagne. In 1916, he was sent to Italy to assist in the battles in "Doberdo" and "Monte Forno" mountains. Then he was transferred back to Belgium "Somme". On October 8, 1916,</p>
<p>he led his team in a charge,</p>
<p>capturing the enemy's position and machine guns. Major-General Hélouis was also injured in this battle and was highly praised by the military. In November 1918, he was discharged from the hospital after recovering from his injuries and was sent to the Rhineland, where he served in the staff offices of the 3rd and 46th Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In 1920, he went to French Guinea in French Africa. Later, he returned to France and served in the 8th and 23rd Brigades of the Colonial Infantry, and also served as a messenger for the Colonial Department. In August 1924, he went to Annam and served as the Battalion Commander of the 5th Military Region.</p>
<p>He made many constructions</p>
<p>concerning traffic within the region. In May 1928, he returned to France. In December of the same year, he was appointed Colonel and served in the Colonial Shooting Brigade in West Africa. Later, he served as an instructor in the infantry and tank departments of the military academy preparatory class. In November 1933, he returned to Annam again and served in the 10th Mixed Brigade of the Colonial Infantry. Then he returned to France and assisted in the design of military preparations in the staff office of the Colonial Infantry, and trained reserve officers in the Paris region. In August 1939, Major-General Hélouis</p>
<p>returned to Annam again.</p>
<p>This was Major-General Hélouis's third visit to Vietnam, serving as the commander of the 10th Mixed Brigade of the Colonial Infantry. In December 1939, he was promoted to Colonel. On March 28th of this year, he came to China by ship from Saigon to serve as the military commander. Major-General Hélouis was awarded the Cross of War Merit for his military achievements.</p>

<p>After the Chinese government made efforts to increase food production, land reclamation in various provinces has been actively carried out and has achieved great results. The harvest of rice, wheat, and other miscellaneous grains in the fourteen provinces of the war zone has increased by 4.6% compared to last year and 11.9% compared to the average of the past seven years. This is quite noteworthy. Therefore, the war zone can be self-sufficient in food supplies and no longer needs to rely on foreign countries.</p>
<h3 id="e75">French Government Requisitions Ships - French Mail Temporarily Suspended - Ships from Nordic Countries Dock at Allied Ports - Norwegian Ships Cooperate with the British Navy in the Eastern Seas - Shanghai's Paper Inventory is Low, Panic is Expected <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>French mail ships operating on European and Far Eastern routes have had irregular schedules since the European War, averaging one decision every half month. According to shipping industry news, the French government has recently requisitioned commercial ships in Europe and the Far East due to the needs of the war. According to news from the French shipping company, various commercial ships will temporarily suspend operations on all routes due to the requisition orders. Therefore, mail ships coming to the Far East will temporarily suspend voyages to Shanghai for a period of one month or more. Operations will resume after the requisition is completed. As for a mail ship that departed from Marseille in early this month, it will arrive in Shanghai within the next week. This is said to be the last mail ship departing.</p>
<p>The impact of the war in Northern Europe on shipping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that after Norway and Denmark were drawn into the vortex of war, shipping in Shanghai has been severely affected. Most of the city's import and export goods are transported by ships from Denmark and Norway. However, at present, these ships have avoided docking at some Allied ports to ensure safety due to the threat of Germany. This point has been confirmed by the Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish consuls stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Observations by the Consuls of the Three Countries in Shanghai</p>
<p>Danish Consul Mr. Hiller stated that no Danish ships would come to Shanghai in the future. There are currently no Danish ships remaining here, and no Danish ships will come to Shanghai until the war ends. Regarding Finnish ships, the statement issued by Finnish Consul Endner was the same as that of Mr. Hiller. Norwegian Consul Knyth also stated that Norwegian ships in the Eastern seas are currently cooperating with the British Navy. Norwegian ships in Shanghai have all sailed to Hong Kong. It is not yet known how long they will dock there. All Norwegian ships are now ordered to sail to Allied ports and do not dock at any neutral ports.</p>
<p>The future of shipping is highly doubtful.</p>
<p>So far, China's coastal trade has not been affected by the European War. However, according to a large shipping company in this city, although its large ships sailing to foreign countries are still continuing to operate, it is doubtful how long they can continue to operate under the current circumstances. The actions of British ships are very irregular and kept secret, so it is impossible to obtain information in advance. In addition, the Shanghai press will face a paper shortage because most of the newsprint is transported from the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. At present, there is only enough stock in this city for three months, and some ships are urgently needed to continue transporting goods to Shanghai.</p>

<p>According to a Chongqing special dispatch published in the Chongqing Daily's weekly magazine yesterday, more than a thousand people participated in the establishment ceremony of the People's Self-Strengthening Association held in Chongqing last month. The organization was formed by uniting all the Qing and Hong Gang organizations within the four provinces. The government also sent special personnel to provide guidance. The persons in charge of the association were sworn into office, and representatives from various public organizations in the city also participated in the ceremony. According to the persons in charge, the association will actively assist the government authorities in evacuating the population from the war zones, maintaining order in the rear, and expanding the conscription movement and other military measures. There are 7 million members of such organizations within Sichuan Province. The establishment and development of the Hongmen and Qingbang sects has a history of more than 200 years. There are also branches overseas, that is, the "Three Harmonies Society," most of whose members are overseas Chinese. In the past, they made many contributions to the national revolutionary movement. The purpose of the members of the two sects is to awaken the people and restore the Han nationality. Therefore, both sides unite to serve the country. Now that the country is in crisis, they should further form a "united front." If the performance in Sichuan Province is excellent, other provinces will also follow suit. According to general statistics, there are 40 million male and female members of the two gangs in the country.</p>

<p>British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, went to Chongqing in December of last year, and it has been almost April. American Ambassador Dr. Johnson also arrived in Chongqing in mid-February of this year, and it has been more than two months. According to a visit by a reporter from the Pinyin News Agency to officials close to the British diplomatic head in Shanghai, the British ambassador will not return to Shanghai in the short term and will remain in Chongqing for at least two months. A visit to the U.S. Consulate General also revealed that there is no news of the American ambassador returning to Shanghai until recently. A reporter also learned from those familiar with foreign diplomatic circles in this city that the length of stay of the British and American ambassadors in Chongqing this time will be much longer than in the past because the two ambassadors do not want to be used to create rumors during this period. At the same time, the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and other countries do not recognize the Nanjing "regime" and will refuse to have any contact with it when they come to Shanghai in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the new regulations requiring stores to clearly mark prices were formulated by the authorities of the two concessions last week and should be implemented this week. It is expected that merchants will have sufficient preparation time by this week to comply with the new rules. When the reporter inquired about this matter from the municipal authorities, they said that these regulations, along with sample price lists, had been distributed to the owners of various stores in the two concessions, but the decision was made to</p>
<p>not urge them for the time being</p>
<p>because the authorities understand that it is quite cumbersome for store owners to comply with the regulations. According to the rules promulgated by the authorities of the two concessions, all stores are required to display price lists, and all goods must be clearly marked with prices so that customers can know the prices in advance. The authorities will also publish weekly reports listing the areas in the city where prices are the lowest, so that buyers can</p>
<p>choose to buy at lower prices.</p>
<p>Therefore, merchants are also willing to compete on fair prices. The committee planning the fair price program has discovered that setting maximum prices is impractical because most essential necessities are perishable and their prices depend on supply and demand.</p>

<h3 id="e84">The Pseudo "Central Market" - Nanshi Branch Also Established - From Now On, There Will Be No Survivors of Local Goods Transported to Shanghai - The Official Opening Date Is Still Uncertain <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Nanshi branch of the pseudo "Central Market" was formally established the day before yesterday. Although the Japanese puppets have already begun to intercept local goods transported to Shanghai from Xujiahui and Pudong, the situation is extremely bleak due to the fact that the Tie Men Gate in Sixteen Pupu has not yet been opened and the local goods merchants have strongly refused to participate. The official opening date is still uncertain. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Complete Control</p>
<p>The scope of the pseudo "Central Market" for intercepting local goods is the Jingning, Huhang railways and the Yangtze River ports. The Bailinan Road branch in Shanghai is in the Suzhou River area. Since the two "markets" opened one after another, local goods from the northwest of the city have been completely controlled. Only the local goods from Xujiahui and Pudong can be transported to Shanghai continuously, allowing the citizens to alleviate the suffering of exploitation, because the "Nanshi Branch" can be established. Now the "Nanshi Branch" has also been established, and the Japanese puppets have also started to control the local goods in Xujiahui and Pudong the day before yesterday. According to news from the local goods merchants, in the past three days, more than 1,000 loads of vegetables and other items transported to Shanghai by villagers in the above two places have been intercepted and forced to be bought at low prices. At this point, local goods in this city have been completely controlled, and the lives of citizens have become even more painful.</p>
<p>Bleak Scene</p>
<p>The "Central Market Branch" near the Ningshao Wharf in Nanshi was established. There was no ceremony at that time, only the interception of local goods began as a preparation for opening. The reporter went to Nanshi yesterday to inspect and saw that the "market" was located in a corner of Ningshao Wharf Road. The vegetable sheds were short and the equipment was simple. All around were the tall buildings of the past, but now there are only broken walls and ruins. The setting sun cast a sad light. Japanese puppet military police were standing in front of the "market" with guns, heavily guarded, so pedestrians turned away. Inside the "market", the courtyard was lonely and there were no people.</p>
<p>Opening Uncertain</p>
<p>The Japanese puppets regarded the opening of the Tie Men Gate in Sixteen Pupu as the only condition for the prosperity of this "branch", so they had tried their best to request the consent of the French Concession authorities. However, they have not yet obtained permission, so the +6 Pupu Tie Men Gate is still closed as before. Although the Nanyang Bridge Xin Kai He Gate has been opened, the traffic is inconvenient. In addition, most of the local goods merchants refuse to "register" to participate, so although the "branch" has been established, the opening date is still far away.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the charity broadcast, which was still held in the glass room of the Xindu Hotel. Because it was Sunday, there were very enthusiastic crowds. Ou Weiguo, Lin Kanghou, and others spoke one after another, clarifying the meaning of not distinguishing between cities and helping each other with united efforts. Then, famous musicians performed Western music. The overture and Madam Wei Li Xuefang, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Junying, were particularly eye-catching. Mr. Xie Xiaochu's daughter's rehearsal of Mei Longzhen and the Cantonese opera by the Hualian Tongle Club were all performed in costumes and were very exciting. The results of the donation were excellent. Today is the last day, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Jin Tingyi will give speeches. Zhang Yeye, He Biandai, and Shen Xiaoting will sing humorous masterpieces. After 4 o'clock, there will be a complete Peking Opera program, with the participation of Hailisheng and all the famous amateur performers, actors, and actresses in Shanghai. The occasion will be unprecedented. All sectors of society are welcome to donate and request songs.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Villagers Near Zhuzhai Tragically Slaughtered <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>More Than a Hundred People Already - The Town Is Still Safe</p>
<p>Regarding the news that the entire town of Zhuzhai was burned down, the reliable news from those who escaped to Shanghai from the town recently is that only a few nearby villages were burned. As of now, the town's houses are still intact as before. However, the situation of guerrilla teams and Japanese puppet troops clashing in the suburbs of Shanghai and the Japanese troops harassing the area is true.</p>
<p>Situation Before the War - Zhuzhai Town is located in western Shanghai, between the Suzhou River and Hongqiao Airport. It was originally a complex area, and the North Zhuzhai Highway can be followed to the New Beijing Highway and then to Shanghai. The transportation is extremely convenient, and it became a rice market center for a time. The troops stationed in the town were originally the guerrilla forces of Gu Fusheng. Gu's troops had a strong reputation with friendly forces and were very powerful. The Japanese puppets did not dare to intervene at first. Later, due to some reasons, Gu's troops moved west to the Guanyintang area, and were replaced by the puppet guerrilla team of Xu Liansheng.</p>
<p>Outline of the Tragedy - This time, near the Wangjia Hong Village in western Panlong Town, a family surnamed Mou held a wedding. There were many guerrilla troops from Gu's troops attending the celebration. More than one Japanese soldier came and were killed by them. The rest escaped, causing a huge wave. A large number of Japanese troops from Nanxiang, Huangdu, Qingpu, Qixian, and Xujing were mobilized to avenge the incident. Heavy street fighting has been occurring along the Qinghu Highway for days, and Gu Fusheng's troops are also fighting back with all their strength. It is said that the Japanese troops have been severely injured. The incident has lasted for a week and is expanding. After the Japanese troops arrived in Zhuzhai Town, they were guided by the puppet troops of Xu's team and searched everywhere for guerrilla forces. Because they found nothing, they cruelly slaughtered the local people to vent their anger. In recent days, more than a hundred farmers in the four villages near the town have been tragically slaughtered. Only townspeople have not been killed. Those who were killed were all farmers because they were similar to the guerrilla forces and were not easy to identify. Women were subjected to inhumane humiliation, which was too horrible to hear. At present, a large number of Japanese troops are still stationed in the town, dressed as our country's farmers, holding ropes, and searching for pedestrians on the road.</p>

<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the Budong Building (translation), located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Zonglu, is leased by the American China Trading Company. Recently, one of the wealthy tenants in the building refused to increase the rent, leading to litigation. The tenant won the case. The China Trading Company then stated that the current rent collected was insufficient to maintain the building. They sent letters to the 45 tenants, stating that the building would be closed on August 31 of this year, and water and electricity would be cut off on that day, and requested the tenants to move out immediately. The tenants did not want to move out, so they asked the French Consul Eugene to mediate. Yesterday (the 20th), Eugene mentioned this matter and said that the French Concession authorities are deeply concerned about the rent issue.

The Stabilization Committee Scheduled to Discuss Fundraising Procedures <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After the Stabilization Committee decided to continue handling stabilization matters, they are soliciting stabilization donations, tentatively set at one million yuan. In addition to the 300,000 yuan already pledged by various industries, the remainder is still awaiting generous donations from all sectors. In order to actively proceed, it has been decided to convene a full committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 2:00 PM on Friday, the 26th of this month. At that time, all fundraising procedures will be decided. Those enthusiastic people from all walks of life who donate funds can directly pay to Shanghai Jincheng Tongrun Fuyuan and other banks.</p>
<p>Prohibit Buying Short: The Shanghai Municipal Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association issued a notice to the market stating, "Buying and selling short has always been strictly prohibited. Rice and grain are necessities for the people, and all transactions must be in cash. Except for foreign rice sales, which can be sold futures based on the original bill of lading, all other buying and selling short is not allowed. Otherwise, if there are disputes, this association will not accept them, and legal sanctions will be imposed. Fearing that it will become a habit over time, a special notice is issued for general knowledge, and it is hoped that everyone will abide by it."</p>
<p>Urging Delivery of Godown Rice: The association issued another notice stating, "We have received a notice from Swire Shipping Company that because the godown is becoming increasingly full of stored rice, later goods cannot be accommodated. The godown rice and grain must be promptly removed. Otherwise, the industry must promptly remove the rice and grain stored in the godown, otherwise the godown rent will be increased. Therefore, we issue a notice urging everyone to find ways to clear the accumulated goods in the godown to avoid excuses for increasing rent. This is very important. Special notice." It is heard that other godowns have similar situations, and those who hoard goods are feeling a little棘手.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Pickled Meat Business: A Steep Decline <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to Obtain Sources, Prices Soaring. The pickled meat industry, including salted meat and salted fish, has recently experienced a stagnant business, and business is extremely sluggish. As a result, some stores in the industry, unable to sustain their operations, may close down in the second half of the year. According to investigations, wholesale dealers such as Datong, Yida, and Jieshun are quite large, with a total of more than eight companies. There are also more than 80 stores in the two concessions. Before the war, each store had an annual turnover of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and the price of each load was only more than ten yuan, but now it has risen to more than 5,000 yuan per load. Furthermore, the sources are subject to taxes and levies. For example, goods worth only 20 yuan are taxed more than 10 yuan by the Japanese and forcibly levied more than 10 yuan by the puppet army. As a result, goods worth 20 yuan are often taxed as much as 30 yuan. In addition, the price of salt has risen, and sales have also decreased. Since the opening of the puppet "Central Market" on April 1, the industry has become even more deserted. The heavy exploitation is even more intensified than before. For example, a commission of 10 yuan must be drawn from every 100 yuan, and most of it is forced to be sold retail. The so-called "retail" is that goods worth more than 100 yuan are forcibly purchased by the puppet government at a low price of more than 90 yuan. After the purchase, the puppet government sells them at a price of 100 yuan, reaping the benefits. However, as the spring and summer seasons are approaching, the weather is too warm, and the manufacture of pickled meat is still awaiting the arrival of autumn. Therefore, the number of these goods transported into the concession recently is very small, only a few thousand per month. The profits obtained by the Japanese and puppets are also limited. Moreover, in reality, most of the goods still come from Shandong, shipped to Shanghai by foreign merchant ships and landed at the concession docks, escaping exploitation. However, the future is extremely difficult to be optimistic.</p>

<p>Small Steamer Department Engine Idling. Labor Hopes for a Reasonable Solution</p>
<p>The strike at the Union Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, which began on the 14th of last month, has not been resolved to this day, more than a month later. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. On the 16th and 17th, workers at the He Feng and Dong Jia Du docks of the shipyard, sympathizing with the workers of the Rui Rong and Ye Song departments, went on strike successively. The small steamer department of the shipyard also went on strike on the 19th. It is heard that the cold work shop and the Chinese employees of the shipyard may also respond. The person in charge of the labor side issued a statement saying that they are extremely willing for the workers and the management to discuss this strike event together and reach a fair and reasonable solution. Therefore, they sincerely hope that the factory will understand that the workers' demands are justified, dispel prejudices, and avoid a situation that becomes unmanageable and increases losses for both labor and management. As for the workers in the He Feng and Dong Jia Du departments and the workers of the small steamer department joining the strike, it is entirely voluntary, all in order to demand improved treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Public Concession Sanitation Overview <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Although the discovery of various infectious diseases last month did not show a trend of drastic development, the number of recorded cases of typhoid fever was three times higher than the previous month. Given that the highest monthly numbers in May and August of last year reached 400 cases, the phenomenon of this disease last month deserves attention. The disinfection methods used during last year's epidemic were quite effective. This year, the refugee shelters where this disease has occurred have also been disinfected separately to emphasize hygiene. The number of vaccinations was no less than 3,659, breaking the previous record and comparable to the number of vaccinations in some European cities throughout the year.</p>
<p>The record of deaths among Chinese people was 3,312, including 1,450 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, typhoid fever, cerebral congestion, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Six Chinese private schools receiving subsidies from the bureau were notified for poor internal equipment, and fifteen were notified for overcrowding. Twenty-one schools were able to fully comply with the regulations, and six were able to reduce overcrowding. Tea houses operated as usual, and prices generally rose.</p>
<p>There are currently 26 shelters in the concession, accommodating a total of 3,356 refugees. The three shelters in Western Shanghai have been closed.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Summary of Important News <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Staff Rice Allowance: Chinese staff of the Public Concession Bureau, all those with a monthly salary of less than one hundred yuan, will be given a rice allowance. The calculation method is to take the average daily rice price in the previous month from the 16th to the 15th of the month, deduct the base rice price of thirty-two yuan per stone of 176 pounds, and half of the remaining number will be the rice allowance to be given, but the maximum shall not exceed seven yuan. If meals are provided by the bureau, this subsidy will no longer be given. According to statistics, the amount for January was 3 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen, for February 3 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen, and for March 6 yuan 7 jiao. The supplements have already been issued according to these numbers.</p>
<p>South City Inoculation: Starting yesterday, the Japanese army and the puppet social bureau in South City began inoculating for epidemic prevention. The inoculation will take place from the 20th to the 27th of this month, and from May 1st to May 7th. After this period, no more inoculations will be given. However, starting today, those entering and leaving South City must have an epidemic prevention certificate, otherwise they will not be allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Shelter News: The first shelter of the Compassionate Relief Association, located at the intersection of North Henan Road and Wenjian Shi Road, and the eleventh shelter, located at the intersection of Hart Road and Love Avenue, will be closed earlier at the end of this month because the landlord needs the houses.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Husband and Wife Should Both Ask Themselves in the Quiet of the Night <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Is your love progressing or regressing? ...</p>
<p>Whether you are a wife or a husband, if you want to create a happy family and enjoy some family happiness, then you must clearly ask yourself in the quiet of the night whether your love is increasing or decreasing: It is of course a good thing if you can continue to increase your love. If your love is gradually decreasing, you should examine the fundamental reasons! There are many simple-minded women who, after marrying their husbands, think that their husbands are always by their side. They often neglect to pay attention. It is not until her husband becomes the lover of another woman that she begins to suspect and feel the change in her husband, but it is too late! On the other hand, there are probably more men who rudely ignore the gentle characteristics of their wives and only seek selfish revelry, not knowing that a strong crossbow at the end of its flight cannot pierce silk, how frustrating is this? Or, in their early years, they indulge in self-gratification, destroying the endocrine function of the reproductive glands, and suffering from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm infertility, and premature aging. Then, after marriage, it will be difficult to have a happy and harmonious marital life. Or, they may be able to cope with it in the early days of marriage, but later they will gradually feel weak and incompetent, or they may even be unable to consummate the marriage at the beginning, how can this not make the wife in her youth feel depressed or full of resentment, leading to elopement, divorce, and other tragedies?</p>
<p>Neglecting the most important things and busying yourself with unimportant things is the most foolish thing to do. The husband is the head of the family, and you, as husband and wife, should carefully consider the development of your love. In case you have the above-mentioned symptoms due to self-gratification in your early years, then in today's era of advanced medicine, treatment is not difficult. Why lose the big for the small, delay and mislead yourself and others!</p>
<p>Treatment methods for the above-mentioned symptoms: According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Reproductive Hormone," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals, is the most effective treatment. Because the ingredients of this preparation are precious and its efficacy is certain, it is unmatched by any similar preparation. After taking it, men can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and invigorate the blood overnight. It is especially suitable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish the nerves, and thicken the sperm and blood. It will definitely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy twice as abundant. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take the special medicine "Ximituo's Sperm-Stabilizing Tablets" (sold in major Chinese and Western pharmacies at two yuan per liang) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop ejaculation for even faster results.</p>
<p>This is a recent fact. The patient is Mr. Zheng Jiamin from Guangdong. After marriage, he had symptoms of premature ejaculation and impotence, and also suffered from spermatorrhea. Although he had repeatedly taken over-the-counter medicines on the market, they were ineffective. Last month, he was introduced by a friend to this clinic for treatment. After a detailed examination of his condition, he was instructed to purchase two dozen "Reproductive Hormone" and half a dozen "Ximituo's Sperm-Stabilizing Tablets" and take them continuously. He was also given the latest medical techniques such as electrotherapy injections every other day. In just one month, he recovered completely, his energy was strong, and the love between husband and wife was as good as new.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness Have Endless Consequences <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and brain weakness in young people often go hand in hand. Indeed, excessive use of the brain can also lead to spermatorrhea, but most people suffer from brain weakness due to spermatorrhea. The brain is the control center of the human body's actions. People are able to think deeply, discern clearly, memorize, and reason to complete their organized and valuable work, and this is entirely due to the function of the brain. How can they function if they suffer from brain weakness?</p>
<p>Why does spermatorrhea lead to brain weakness? According to medical judgment, semen is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands in the body. In addition to being transported through the vas deferens to the seminal vesicles for reproductive purposes, most of the fluid can directly penetrate the blood and irrigate the whole body, nourishing the brain, nerves, spinal cord, and other parts. If young people suffer from spermatorrhea and delay treatment, the brain nerves will be the first to be affected, and then symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, and blurred vision will arise. In addition, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy are signs of sexual nerve weakness; back pain, aching limbs, and fatigue are symbols of spinal nerve weakness. Not only that, if spermatorrhea leads to sperm depletion and blood depletion, then the development process will also stagnate, and the metabolic function will decline. Symptoms such as incomplete development and premature aging will then arise. Such young people will inevitably fail in their studies, find it difficult to learn a trade, be abandoned by women, and hated by their wives and concubines. How sad is such a life!</p>
<p>Young people with spermatorrhea must remedy this invisible disability. The only way is to quickly take the special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Ximituo's Sperm-Stabilizing Tablets," to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves. Spermatorrhea can be cured the night after taking the medicine. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to spermatorrhea, you must also take "Reproductive Hormone," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals, to nourish the brain and kidneys, sperm and blood, and nerves. Continuous use will definitely cure the various symptoms in a short period of time, making the brain strong and the spirit full. Then the future can be unlimited! Those who can personally come to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment can be guaranteed to be cured of spermatorrhea.</p>

<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>In the sunny weather, hundreds of flowers bloom,</p>
<p>Ladies on spring outings come in droves,</p>
<p>Full breasts and slender waists are so charming,</p>
<p>Everyone praises the good figure.</p>
<p>A shapely, fleshy, and healthy beauty, if she makes an appointment with three or five girlfriends and walks leisurely in a green park in this season of abundant sunshine and blooming flowers, I believe it will definitely attract the attention of many tourists. Not only attention, but perhaps there will also be handsome young men in suits and leather shoes pursuing them. Because "beauty" and "ugliness" are things that everyone can see. No matter how famous you are for being clumsy or a student, when you see a plump arm, a graceful waist, crystal muscles, and clear curves, especially the pair of tall breasts in front, shrugging the left and right lapels, as if nodding to every tourist who is paying attention, then even if you have no evil thoughts, your eyes will involuntarily be directed there. Not only directed there, but even if you have passed her, you will turn your head back to look at her a few more times before you feel relaxed and happy. Therefore, healthy beauties with particularly developed features always have an advantage when buying things and interacting with people. Even in the sexual life between husband and wife, because their ovarian function is particularly strong and their sensuality is strong, they are like fish in water, and the love between them is deeply admired by friends and relatives. However, if in the past you have suffered from symptoms such as binding your breasts, self-gratification, irregular menstruation, or excessive vaginal discharge, which have damaged your ovarian function and affected breast development, then even if you have a beautiful face, you will inevitably be disliked by modern men, and your fate will be very tragic! As for the method of salvation, according to Chinese and Western preparations of ovarian hormone, "Female Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective treatment. Once you take it, it will greatly increase your strength, nourish your ovarian function, promote metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop vaginal discharge. If you continue to take it, it will definitely eliminate the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, making your breasts tall, your arms plump, and your cheeks rosy, enhancing your health and beauty.</p>

<p>Unintentionally Entering Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>In the initial acute symptoms, they often unintentionally enter chronic gonorrhea. According to the results of my years of experience, in addition to gonococci, there are often other bacteria mixed in, especially those caused by bacilli. The patient's subjective symptoms are an uncomfortable itching sensation in the urethra, or a slight pain, and they begin to seek medical treatment. Because they do not pay attention to hygiene, they unintentionally allow the gonococci to invade the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, resulting in prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, cystitis, and systemic infectious arthritis, and they realize that their pain has not only not healed, but has become more severe.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in these cases, the urine is not completely turbid, but is mostly transparent, or slightly stained with a small amount of gonococci. However, in fact, these cases are often unintentionally transmitted to the opposite sex. Therefore, wives and husbands must pay attention to these chronic gonorrhea symptoms and seek immediate treatment. Whenever encountering these symptoms, the urine must be cultured and repeatedly examined, or the prostate must be massaged, and the fluid extracted must be examined under a microscope to identify gonococci and other bacilli, and determine the location of gonorrhea. Only then can the treatment be accurate, and the success rate will be high. In terms of treatment methods, the first is German electrical gonorrhea treatment, in which the conductor is inserted into the urethra, and then the degree of electricity is adjusted according to the severity of the condition, and the bactericidal power is directly transmitted to the lesion, stopping at the appropriate point. German serum is also selected to resist gonorrhea, kill bacteria, and provide immunity. Other methods such as washing, shock therapy, cooling, and warm bath therapy can all be applied according to the symptoms. In this way, chronic gonorrhea in these cases can be cured in four or five weeks.</p>

<p>Wu Kang Medicinal Materials Firm, formerly located on Xian Gua Street in the Nanshi area, moved to 390 Hankou Road in the Public Concession, a two-story building with double storefronts, after the January 28th Incident. Business was usually quite good. Recently, a large batch of new medicinal materials had been brought in and stored upstairs. Unexpectedly, around midnight last night, a fire suddenly broke out. Dense smoke filled the air, and the flames lit up the sky. Instantly, the fire spread to the neighboring He Li Yuan Medicinal Materials Firm at 394 Hankou Road. Upon receiving the alarm, the fire brigade rushed to the scene and exerted every effort to extinguish the blaze. It was not until about 1:00 AM this morning that the fire was finally put out. As a result, the building and a large quantity of medicinal materials of the Wu Kang firm were completely burned to the ground. One building of the He Li Yuan firm was also destroyed by the fire. The firm had more than 20 employees, but only 16 managed to escape at the time. It was found that four people had perished in the fire. Firefighters pulled out two bodies. Another employee, Zhang Kangning (45 years old), escaped from the fire but was burned. He was taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. His injuries are extremely serious, and his life is in danger. It is reported that the losses are quite substantial. The cause of the fire is unknown, and the police are investigating.</p>

<p>The lawyer Jin Yu has a son named Dexiang, who is 30 years old this year. Several years ago, because Jin Dexiang did not engage in legitimate work and indulged in depravity, Lawyer Jin published a statement in the newspaper severing the father-son relationship. Recently, Dexiang's wife, Li Zongxiu (30 years old this year, from Anting), currently residing at No. 1, Lao Shou'an Lane, Ba Xian Qiao, also found their cohabitation unbearable. She specifically commissioned lawyer Wang Xintang to submit a petition to the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, filing for divorce from her husband. It is alleged that the plaintiff and the defendant were married in 1929 and have a son named Shouchun, who is 11 years old this year. Because the defendant does not engage in legitimate work, his parents-in-law no longer consider him their son. He wanders around all day and has become a beggar. Therefore, for more than ten years, the mother and son have been miserable and lonely, which is something that ordinary people cannot endure. Recently, after searching everywhere for the defendant's whereabouts, it was learned that he had been arrested by the police and transferred to the Beggars' Reformatory. Thinking of her desolate future, with nowhere to turn, she was compelled to request the court to grant a divorce. Upon receiving the petition, the court, through Judge Yu, summoned the parties to the Seventh Civil Division. The defendant's whereabouts were unknown, so the plaintiff's agent lawyer Chen stated the case. He requested public notice. The court reviewed the case and instructed that the summons be rescheduled.</p>

<p>He Wansheng (32 years old, nicknamed "Old Xi Da Wang"), a notorious pickpocket gang leader from Suzhou, usually dresses impeccably and behaves extravagantly. He keeps both a wife and a concubine at home. He specializes in pickpocketing passengers on public buses. When committing theft, he first uses a safety razor blade to cut open the passenger's pocket, allowing him to easily obtain the stolen money. Countless people have fallen victim. Unexpectedly, Lu Huizhong, residing at No. 12, 1125 Yuyuan Road, had over 500 yuan in national currency in his pocket on the 15th of this month. While riding the No. 22 public bus, he encountered He, the thief. As He was about to carry out his trick, Lu discovered him, grabbed him, and called for arrest. He was detained in the police station and confessed to numerous crimes. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The thief's wife and concubine were also in court to observe. Their clothing was unusually modern, and those who did not know them would have suspected they were wealthy people's mistresses. After Judge Li Weishan conducted a trial, the case was postponed to the morning of the 24th because the plaintiff, Lu Huizhong, had not been summoned. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>An Jinshun, an old Anhui native in his forties and a shareholder of the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road, resides in a Western-style house at No. 21, 1293 Lane (Jiande Lane), Yuyuan Road. At around 1:45 AM yesterday morning, ten bandits wielding Mauser pistols stormed into his home, intimidating and threatening the master and servants, and confining them in one room. They assigned two bandits to monitor their movements, forbidding them from making any noise. The remaining bandits ransacked the place, arbitrarily searching and looting. It is estimated that cash, jewelry, and valuable clothing worth over 70,000 yuan were stolen. Furthermore, a self-prepared handgun that the victim usually kept, with the number 366047, was also stolen. The bandits carried out their looting for about an hour before fleeing with their loot. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station and requested an investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Trademark Lawsuit Involving Turtle Trademark: Appeal Dismissed <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Chen Taiyan, a Ningbo native and owner of the Meiling Pharmacy at 614 Nanjing Road, previously produced a kidney-nourishing pill called "Tiger-Turtle-Bear-Deer" (also known as "Wealth-Honor-Prosperity"). After registering the trademark with the Trademark Bureau and passing the inspection by the Health Department of the Municipal Council, he launched the product. Han Longzhou, the owner of the Liu San Pharmacy, claimed that the turtle depicted in the trademark pattern of Chen's product was similar to the turtle trademark of his kidney-invigorating pills. He filed a criminal lawsuit against Chen in the First Special District Court for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, and filed a civil lawsuit requesting a court order to publish a statement and destroy the trademarked items. Chen argued that his product and the plaintiff's product were clearly different in terms of name, pattern, box color, bottle color, and pill color. The size of the turtles depicted was also different. How could it be said that he was counterfeiting? After the trial, Chen was found not guilty, and the civil lawsuit was dismissed. Han, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court and also filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau. The Trademark Bureau rejected the objection. The appeal case was also heard by the High Court. Chen's lawyers, Qian Xingzhong, Zhu Qichao, and Huang Huancheng, presented various documents and evidence from the Trademark Bureau, requesting that the appellant's appeal be dismissed. After the presiding judge Zhou Hanting of the Second Branch of the High Court concluded the trial, the judgment was announced yesterday, dismissing both Han's criminal appeal and the civil lawsuit. The turtle-related lawsuit thus came to an end.</p>

<p>It is reported that the Songyuan gambling den at 626 Haig Road usually entices people to gamble for profit and has made considerable gains. This has attracted covetous eyes. In the middle of last week, they received a threatening letter demanding a large sum of money and arranging a meeting at a certain location. After the gambling den reported to the police, they went to the meeting as scheduled and apprehended two people who had written the threatening letter. Zhou Zhao, a woman from Hangzhou residing at No. 8, Lane 71, Jing'an Temple Road, was detained by the police on the 18th of this month for beating her maid Wang Jinfeng (9 years old). Yesterday, she was sent to the First Special District Court. After Judge Xiao ascertained the facts, he sentenced Zhou Zhao to a fine of 15 yuan for causing bodily harm.

<p>Investigation of Copper Production in Yunnan Province</p>
<p>The Yunnan province procures copper ingots for the casting of coins inside and outside the capital, with an annual requirement of over ten million ingots. During the Qianlong era, due to the country's wealth and abundant currency, the Baoquan and Baoyuan Bureaus had already reduced printing and stopped casting coins, and the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Huguang had also separately ceased production. However, the annual copper ingot quota was still procured and transported as before. This was because national taxation was crucial, and the transport of copper ingots took time. It was necessary to widely store reserves for continuous supply, rather than risk shortages. During the Daoguang era, due to the old and exhausted mines and the low production of copper ingots, the officials in charge were deeply concerned that the capital supply would be insufficient. Therefore, anyone who could find a new mine was immediately ordered to attempt mining, using the surplus of one mine to compensate for the deficiency of another. Subsequently, an imperial edict was issued, instructing the governors of Yunnan province to investigate the situation, properly discuss regulations, to eliminate corruption, promote benefits, enrich the country, and benefit the people. Furthermore, Yunnan province is rich in gold mines, not just copper ingots. According to the records of the Ministry of Revenue in the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing era, the silver mines in Yunnan were assessed at sixteen locations, with the total annual tax silver extracted at 26,550 taels. In the nineteenth year of the Jiaqing era, the Baisha mine was depleted and closed, and an imperial decree was issued to remove it from the list. After that, there were fifteen mines with fixed tax quotas, with an annual tax silver extraction of 24,114 taels, recorded in the Ministry of Revenue's regulations, and the gold mines in Kaihua Prefecture, Heqing Prefecture, and Yongbei Subprefecture were also taxed according to their quotas. Therefore, Yunnan province has been the most prominent and longest-running province in managing mining affairs. When Lin Wen-zhong served as governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, he issued instructions to conduct thorough surveys within his jurisdiction, widely inform the people, and cautiously encourage mining. The subprefectures and counties of Zhenyuan, Wenshan, and Guangtong, as well as the Talan Subprefecture under the jurisdiction of Pu'er Prefecture, all gradually recruited people to conduct trials. Although the tax quota was not large, the natural abundance of resources was evident. Where there is land, there must be wealth. How can it be abandoned? If it can be managed effectively, it will undoubtedly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="e113">A Note on Flower Viewing and the Flower Flag <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>The rickshaws are adorned with spring flowers, making the "trip" worthwhile.</p>
<p>In this world, there is much sadness and misfortune. How many people die for fame and fortune, and how many die in worry because they cannot achieve their greatest desires in both fame and fortune. They do not know to sacrifice their life's energy to seek happiness for the masses or, further, to promote the glory of their national language and scholarship. To simply disappear after a century and rot with the grass and trees is not worthwhile. Now that the war situation is changing, the arguments of psychiatrists in various countries all advise people to change their environment with a happy spirit. This makes me think of the tranquility of ancient artists and literati, finding joy in poverty, composing poetry and appreciating flowers to create their own happy境 界, indirectly creating a happy environment for the general public to love natural beauty. They truly have the immeasurable virtue of silently turning the wheels of heaven and secretly advancing the world towards peace. Therefore, Western countries cast artists and literati in bronze statues and worship them for centuries without change.</p>
<p>I believe that China is a poor country, and the people are facing many difficulties and national crises. To seek a bright future, we must be determined to find happiness in poverty. The most effective way for a poor country to steadily achieve peace is to open flower exhibitions and promote flower viewing tours. The ancient sages have a constant saying, "We are not afraid of scarcity but of inequality." For example, if Western cities in the European War occasionally lacked food, they would not worry about the "scarcity" of supply as long as the distribution was "equal." The path to fame and fortune is extremely narrow and cannot meet the unlimited "demand" of the world. Only the happiness of enjoying nature requires the least number of artists and literati to devote their efforts. Once the atmosphere changes with it, it can make hundreds of millions of people smile together. I would like to introduce the "Flower Viewing Flag" of European flower exhibitions and flower viewing tours so that my compatriots can understand the way to be content in poverty and find joy in this day when the earth returns to spring.</p>
<p>Holland is a flower country on the sea. The country has many small farmers, and their artificial cultivation results in many "fine products." Families use potted plants for worship every day. In the spring of 1935, when the country was generally peaceful, the Dutch people held a large flower exhibition in Heemstede, a countryside near Haarlem in North Holland Province. Those who were interested printed many different sizes of "Flower Viewing Flags," which were sold out in a few days. Those who arrived late could not get them. All vehicles used for flower viewing tours, whether cars or bicycles, had a flag attached, fluttering in the wind, returning home happily. The smallest type is a silk flag, rectangular in shape, printed with the Dutch specialty tulips and daffodils as a symbol. The flag is 16.5 cm long and 9.5 cm wide. The iron supporting the flag is 30 cm long and 2 mm in diameter, about as thick as a knitting needle used by women. The difference is that the upper end of the rod is shaped like a nail head like a wire nail. Another type is a triangular felt flag, 15.5 cm high and 25.5 cm wide at the widest point of the horizontal surface. The iron rod is the same as above. Liu Yuxi, a poet of the Tang Dynasty in China, wrote a poem about flower viewing: "Purple paths and red dust come, everyone says they are returning from flower viewing. The peach trees in the Xuandu Temple are all planted by Liu Lang, going and coming." I have left the country three times, and more than 20 years have passed before and after. Past events are like clouds, and I cannot help but feel like Liu Lang returning again.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Cloth as Precious as Gold <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is rising sharply, and cotton cloth prices are also soaring without end! Before the war, a piece of 12-pound coarse twill cloth was sold for only eight or nine yuan, but now it sells for forty or fifty yuan a piece. Forty yards costs about a foot, but currently, it sells for five or six cents a foot. It is truly a case of vegetables selling at meat prices and cloth selling at silk prices! If this continues, will everyone be forced to "cover their bodies and walk naked"? This is a serious problem for social life!</p>
<p>Rice is as precious as pearls, and cloth is as precious as gold. For families like mine with many children, I truly feel helpless! Therefore, since my family fled from East Shanghai to West Shanghai, it has been almost three years. The clothes of my entire family are still completely old clothes. If they are torn, they are torn; patching them up is fine. Moreover, the cloth clothes made before the war were very strong and durable. As long as you cherish them when you wear them and fold them neatly when you store them, there is no problem in wearing them year after year for a long life. I often wear old cloth clothes and treat them as treasures, often thinking of the hard work involved in the process of carding cotton, spinning yarn, sizing yarn, weaving cloth, and making clothes. I am all the more eager to cherish old clothes in view of the current high prices of cloth clothes. Mr. Zhu Bailu said: "One bite of porridge and one bowl of rice, we should think of the difficulty of obtaining them; half a thread and half a strand, we should always remember the difficulty of material resources." This is indeed a timeless motto. My mother also taught me, saying, "If you cherish food, you will have food to eat; if you cherish clothes, you will have clothes to wear." The words of the ancients are truly golden and jade-like advice.</p>
<p>Given the current situation of "cloth as precious as gold," it would cost more than twenty gold pieces to make a cloth robe! Therefore, cherishing an old robe is equivalent to saving more than twenty gold pieces. It can even be said that you are invisibly reducing the burden of more than twenty gold pieces on the expenditure side and saving the capital of more than twenty gold pieces. If everyone in the family does this, the invisible savings will be considerable. Why wouldn't everyone be happy to do it?</p>
<p>Therefore, my motivation for writing this article is that in this difficult time of "cloth as precious as gold," everyone should still try to wear old clothes as much as possible and not try to live beyond your means, swelling your face to look fat, and overspending and making your life more difficult. I hope everyone pays attention.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Economic Menu for One Week <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>There has been a miracle in the vegetable market these days. In the midst of rising prices, it is possible to buy relatively cheap yellow croakers, only one and a half cents per two. You can buy a medium-sized yellow croaker for one dime. My family originally needed to eat two meat dishes every day, but we also took economic aspects into consideration. Because yellow croakers are cheap, we eat yellow croakers almost every day. Fortunately, there are many ways to cook yellow croakers, so we can change the style every day, so it doesn't become monotonous for a week. For example, you can braise it with pickled mustard greens or in red sauce, or braise it with bamboo shoots in red sauce or stir-fry it with vinegar. You can dredge it in flour and breadcrumbs and fry it, which can be used as a dish or a snack. In addition, you can debone the yellow croaker and make a soup with amaranth or lettuce笋 leaves, which can be used to make yellow croaker soup or yellow croaker fillet soup. All these methods are very delicious, and it all depends on the proper management of the housewife.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Meaning of Frugality <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— He Yichang</p>
<p>If a person does not eat for one day, they will be hungry; if they do not eat for seven days, they will die. Therefore, the people regard food as heaven. Eating and drinking enter the stomach, originally to nourish life. After digestion by the spleen and stomach, it is transformed into essence, distributed throughout the body. The rest becomes dross, excreted through the feces. Therefore, eating and drinking should be temperate, avoiding overeating. Overeating is not only useless but also harmful, not only making people sick but also shortening lifespan. In the past, Confucius said: "A gentleman does not seek fullness in food." A common saying goes: "Eating less tastes better; eating more ruins the stomach." This is the meaning. However, because people mistakenly believe that eating and drinking nourish life, they often like to eat too much and indiscriminately, thinking that a large appetite means good health. This view is greatly mistaken. One should know that a person's stomach has a certain digestive capacity. If one eats too much, the stomach will expand, the working time will be lengthened, and the consumption of digestive power will be greater. Food in the stomach easily ferments, and the intestinal walls are more prone to decay. If the intestines and stomach are gradually injured, how can a person's lifespan be sustained for long? Mr. Ding Fubao, in his recent book "Conditions for Longevity," also advises people to eat frugally, saying that in European and American countries, the number of people who die each year from gluttony is countless, showing the harm of overeating. Moreover, during this period of widespread war and high living costs, it is even more appropriate to advocate "frugality." Rice must be eaten less and chewed carefully, and dishes should be reduced to save energy for the country and maintain health for oneself. It is also very beneficial to the national and family economy. Currently, Japan, England, and Germany are all holding "frugality movements." As our country faces severe national difficulties and is in a state of "universal poverty," we should also promote it.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Seasickness <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Jiz</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled on a sea vessel has experienced the pain of seasickness!</p>
<p>When seasick, one first feels a bit dizzy, as if one cannot be sure where one is sitting. Then, one feels a slight throbbing in the forehead, some pain, discomfort in the abdomen, cold sweats all over the body, and the complexion turns pale, the lips turn purple-blue, and the eyeballs are covered with blood vessels. Finally, one vomits, first emptying the food from the stomach, then the white mucus, and then only dry heaves.</p>
<p>Seasickness is such a painful thing, but what is the reason for it? According to the general theory, seasickness is caused by the aversion of the inner ear's vestibular nerve to the swaying of the ship. The vestibular nerve is a nerve that maintains body balance. Its hair-like endings protrude into the lymphatic fluid. When our head moves rapidly, the pressure of the lymphatic fluid changes with the shaking. The hair-like endings of the vestibular nerve are also shaken, transmitting this to various nerves, causing the muscles necessary to maintain body balance to contract in order to maintain body balance. At the same time, it directly or indirectly stimulates the vagus nerve and other nerves, affecting the digestive organs (stomach, intestines), circulatory organs (heart, blood), and so on. Thus, dizziness, lightheadedness, pale complexion, vomiting, and so on follow.</p>
<p>Since this is the reason, the treatment can only be local. For example, if you feel uncomfortable in the chest, open the window, change the air, and take deep breaths. To avoid the pain of vomiting, it is better to keep the abdomen empty. Find something else to distract yourself, do not dwell on the fear of dizziness, and do not let the bad surroundings stimulate your nerves. In terms of medication, no specific drugs have been invented. Commonly, tranquilizers and analgesics are used, and sometimes anesthetics are also used, but these are not fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>In short, those who are physically strong or who are accustomed to traveling by boat or car from childhood are better off, while nervous people are more likely to suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>Heavenly Chef's Recipes (10)</p>
<h3 id="e118">(17) Curry Shrimp (Western Style) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>

<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The effect of clothing on people is to keep them warm and protect their skin, and its appearance is to express demeanor and spirit. All different lifestyles can also be revealed in clothing. However, as human life has gradually changed and evolved to the present, the enjoyment of nature has also progressed with creation. Clothing has taken the position of ornaments in the lives of urban people. Most people only seek the beauty and uniqueness of form and material to proclaim their own nobility. As a result, the deformed concept of "valuing clothes over people" has emerged in society. All kinds of treachery, evil, cruelty, and fraud are growing and continuing under the cover of beautiful appearances.</p>
<p>We only need to pay attention to the social news in the newspapers to get clear examples. What about a gorgeously dressed girl stealing items in a department store; a well-dressed young man stealing books in a bookstore, etc.? It can be seen that in Shanghai, it is wrong to judge a person's character and personality based on the quality of their clothing. To put it plainly: many Shanghai people live in tenements and cannot afford to eat two out of three meals, but when they go out, their clothes are very gorgeous. When they walk into any large company or building, even the doorman treats them with respect, not only daring not to treat them as poor wretches, but also regarding them as good customers. There are also many people who drive cars but cannot afford the gasoline, borrowing and owing debts, but still drive fast in the city in the middle of the day. There are also those who are heavily in debt, but their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are still very extravagant—however, this requires "artistic" skills; otherwise, it would not be possible.</p>
<p>On the other hand—especially after the war, the appearance of some people's clothing is completely typical of a rural person, with torn clothes and cloth shoes, patches on top of patches, looking like a complete pauper. Even beggars would not ask them for money on the street. But what are they actually like? Some of them are actually wealthy. It may not be possible to bury money in the cellar in Shanghai, but in their torn clothes and rags, there may be thousands or even tens of thousands of banknotes hidden: these people neither steal nor rob, and their behavior is absolutely respectable, but they are not valued simply because their clothes are not fashionable. Someone who worked in a jewelry store told me: in jewelry stores, nine out of ten welcome fashionable people, because generally fashionable people who come into jewelry stores to buy ornaments often lose eight fen out of one qian, and still ask for a few yuan in change. On the other hand, generally rural people want their rings to be as thick as possible. They lift their aprons, and rolls of banknotes are pulled out from their bellybands or belts. Therefore, jewelry stores mostly look at these people with different eyes.</p>
<p>From this anecdotal experience, the division between emptiness and solidity is fully revealed, and the mystery of clothing and people is shattered without residue. An "empty shell" is worthless once it is exposed. Gorgeous clothing can only cover the blemishes on the body, but it cannot conceal the baseness of personality and character, and the emptiness of financial resources. In the current situation of striving for wartime economic frugality, we must have considerable determination. As long as we can maintain body temperature, we do not need to worry about objective evaluations, and we should express true beauty with personality and character, because the deformed concept of "valuing clothes over people" is not absolute!</p>
<h3 id="e122">Spring is bright, don't delay quitting your addiction, a sincere warning to those who hate opium <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Du Ying</p>
<p>Lie down and think, sit and speak, get up and act</p>
<p>If you want to avoid suffering, eliminate opium addiction</p>
<p>Since opium flowed into China, I don't know how many promising people have been harmed, and since Shanghai became an isolated island, the source has been cut off, and the price of earth has risen sharply. The Yunnan earth, which was originally sold for about two or three yuan per liang, has risen to forty or fifty yuan per liang since last autumn, but still no genuine Yunnan earth is available. The vast gentleman group is lamenting endlessly, and because they are smoking inferior earth mixed with impurities, they are becoming more deeply poisoned, and some have even switched to smoking more poisonous substances such as morphine and heroin. This is truly a serious problem. This reporter recently interviewed Dr. Lai Gongliang, a specialist in quitting smoking at the Gongjian Hospital on Baker Road, about the current state of opium poisoning. Dr. Lai gave a detailed account of everything, and his words were to the point, which can be used as a reference for black-listed compatriots.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Lai, the previous Yunnan earth, Sichuan earth, and so on, were relatively less harmful because they were pure plants. Now, however, the source of Yunnan earth and Sichuan earth has been cut off, and the authorities have also strictly prohibited planting. Therefore, most of what is sold on the market is made by mixing various potent poisons such as heroin, high root, and silver with the "material." Therefore, after smoking, people often experience dizziness, chest tightness, palpitations, loss of appetite, thirst, shortness of breath, soreness in the limbs, a gray-black complexion, and the appearance of itchy small red spots on the skin. Also, when smoking, they feel a strong smell, but even if they smoke freely, they cannot invigorate their spirits, and the effect disappears in an instant. Therefore, smokers are paying such a high price to smoke this kind of inferior earth, which truly fits the ancient proverb "drinking poison to quench thirst."</p>
<p>In view of the above situation, smoking opium today is tantamount to digging one's own grave, but why don't smokers quit? Isn't it self-indulgence? In fact, this cannot be blamed on smokers, because quitting smoking is not easy, and those who smoke the current inferior earth find it even more difficult to completely eradicate their addiction without experienced knowledge and the combination of expensive medicines. Therefore, those who quit smoking do not understand the truth in this, or they are greedy for low prices, or they seek quick results, or they are completely impressed by exaggerated publicity. Quitting smoking in this way will naturally lead to repeated relapses, making it impossible to completely break the addiction. Even before the addiction is quit, the body becomes weaker. Therefore, the repeated relapses of smokers cannot be blamed on their lack of perseverance, but on their failure to carefully select a doctor.</p>
<p>Seeking a doctor and a prescription, for this reason, my treatment for quitting smoking is to maintain my reputation of more than ten years and ensure responsible and safe quitting. I do not use injections (because injections often have many drawbacks), nor do I mislead people with speed (because haste makes waste). I completely analyze the smoker's smoking amount, quality of earth, period, body, psychology, and condition, and then prescribe expensive medicines and administer different treatments. Not only is the smoking addiction quit, but the disease is also treated at the same time. To take care of the smoker's economic time, they do not have to be hospitalized during the quitting process and can continue to work, while also feeling comfortable in body and mind and invigorated in spirit. Other drugs such as morphine and heroin are also treated with the same most fundamental and effective method, so the results are fortunately all completely broken, never relapsed, and health is improved day by day. In short, each person has their own physique, temperament, and the depth of their addiction, which cannot be achieved by taking shortcuts or blindly adhering to outdated methods.</p>
<p>Dr. Lai's smoking cessation treatment has four major characteristics: (1) increased food intake, (2) stable sleep, (3) smooth bowel movements, and (4) invigorated spirit. To gain the trust of those receiving treatment, he first prescribes medicine for a two-day trial period. If they are satisfied, he will formally administer treatment without any pain. Therefore, Dr. Lai Gongliang of Gongjian Hospital at 208 Baker Road is the other shore that smokers must reach.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Sports and Hygiene Week <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ya</p>
<p>Exercise is an indispensable part of life. In addition to our daily ordinary (such as walking, etc.) or laborious (such as washing clothes, etc.) exercise, there is no doubt that we also need a specific, regular exercise. That is to say, we must have a certain amount of exercise every day: such as morning exercises, playing ball, riding a horse, swimming... etc. However, we are in a pigeon-cage-like isolated island, and the place to live has already become a problem, how can there be any spare space left for us to exercise? Even if there is, it is only for some noble ladies and gentlemen to spend their time.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of exercise venues, the health of the people living on the isolated island has been greatly affected. Nowadays, although some people are still doing indoor exercises to make up for this shortcoming, it is only a very small number of people!</p>
<p>Recently, Chongqing Aviation News announced that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs have stipulated that National Sports and Hygiene Week will be from May 5th to 12th, and ordered the social bureaus and education departments of all provinces and cities to conduct health checks for primary and secondary school students. Honestly, we cannot but pay attention to and promote this movement; due to the promotion of this movement, we can better understand the government's emphasis on the health and hygiene of the people, especially young people. At the same time, we can also associate it with the health of the people living on the isolated island these days, and those with illness who are living in isolation on the island probably account for half of them." After this shocking number, there is a genuine sense of ". We should not underestimate this movement. At the same time, we should respond to this movement and hope that the city's doctors will provide free health checks for the people of the city during the dates of this movement.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Problem of Bathing and Cleanliness <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Zili</p>
<p>The weather is getting hot again, so this densely populated Shanghai, where people live like pigeons in cages, is having problems again. In winter, it doesn't matter if several people are squeezed into one room, but in hot weather, it doesn't work, especially in dormitories such as schools, hygiene problems need more attention. Shanghai school dormitories are generally very small, and many students live in them. Schools are very negligent about the cleanliness and hygiene of students, and do not pay attention to it, so the dormitories are often very messy and filthy, and at night they are filled with a special smell, which is very harmful to the health of young students.</p>
<p>In this environment, it may not be possible to make excessive demands to thoroughly improve the school authorities, but as this hot summer is approaching, public places are very prone to dangerous epidemics, so I sincerely hope that the school can implement the following points as a preventive measure:</p>
<p>First, order all students to be vaccinated against smallpox and vaccinated against epidemics as soon as possible. Second, provide bathing facilities. Bathing is urgently needed after the weather is hot, but the cost of going to the bathhouse is high, and most students cannot afford it, so the school should set up its own bathroom or contact the bathhouse to give preferential treatment to students. Third, attention should be paid to the cleanliness of student bedrooms. More attention should be paid to the fact that students often do not change their bedding for a semester, and some do not even tidy up. Therefore, teachers should often urge students to change or wash and wash bedding and conduct general cleaning of the  room.</p>
<p>"A sound mind resides in a sound body." I hope that today's schools will pay more attention to the health of students while teaching them.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Rectification of "One-Sided Eggs" (1) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— San San</p>
<p>Reading the article "One-Sided Eggs" by Mr. (Liren) on the 19th, it refers to the packaged meals using "egg yolks" bought from biscuit companies for cooking every day. He said; "…You think, the protein has been extracted by the biscuit company for use in biscuits, then isn't this residue useless…But we don't have to eat meat, we would rather eat green vegetables and tofu than eat this kind of "one-sided egg.""</p>
<p>Of course, we are not as comfortable eating packaged meals for a lower price as we are cooking ourselves or going to a restaurant. At the same time, the packaged meal makers are providing us with food in the midst of rising prices of all goods, so they have to handle the ingredients from destinations with lower prices. This is their hard work, and we should forgive them. Moreover, under the current situation, we can eat "eggs," which can be considered lucky on the hunger line.</p>
<p>Also, "egg yolk" is not a bad thing, it has less "protein" than "egg white" and a large amount (fat), and its nutritional content is similar to that of "fatty meat". Now I will write the percentage of nutritional content of "egg white," "egg yolk," "green vegetables," and "tofu" below, and compare it with pork:</p>
<p>Protein Fat</p>
<p>Egg White 20.6 None</p>
<p>Egg Yolk 16.2 30.7</p>
<p>Green Vegetables 1.7 0.2</p>
<p>Tofu 35.0 18.0</p>
<p>Fatty Pork 14.0 37.3</p>
<p>Lean Pork 19.5 6.8</p>
<p>(II) Li Zhi</p>
<p>(Above omitted) In terms of nutrition, egg yolk is indeed more nutritious than egg white. The composition of the two is as follows:</p>
<p>Egg Yolk Egg White</p>
<p>Water 49.5 86.2</p>
<p>Protein 15.7 12.3</p>
<p>Fat 33.3 0.2</p>
<p>In addition, egg yolk is rich in vitamins A, B, and D, and contains a large amount of iron and phosphorus, which are elements for nourishing blood and the brain. Currently, nutritionists in Europe and the United States advocate eating eggs and discarding the egg white in favor of the egg yolk. That's the reason. In this light, the so-called (one-sided egg) is actually a nourishing food!</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>Old friends reunite, articles have value, scenic spots are well-managed</p>
<p>He Li asked, "Presumably the agency department is even more developed now. When can we also visit it?" Qu Wushuang said, "The agency department is not connected to the newspaper office. It is set up as a separate department. The reason why they entrusted us in the beginning was because our newspaper can reach everywhere, even remote rural areas, and it is mostly due to the power of this advertisement. This agency department is mostly related to cultural undertakings. But now many trust departments are also handled, and as transportation has gradually developed, there are liaison offices in various border and inland areas. So we want to close the agency department and transfer it to another organization."  Just as they were talking about that, Wu Junsu smiled and asked: "There is one more thing I want to ask. Just now, Sister Wushuang pointed at Huihua and said that she is a movie star. Has she really made movies?" Qu Wushuang laughed: "That's just a joke. Once, many male and female reporters in our newspaper office went on a spring outing and also took a camera to shoot their own films. It was the time when the flowers were like brocade and the fragrant grass was like a carpet. We also held picnics, bringing many breads, cold foods, and canned foods ourselves. She! Huihua! Was the happiest. She was just jumping around. Whenever we encountered scenic spots, we would shoot with the camera. Because she was happy, we asked her to be a character in the film. Sometimes we asked her to sit by the water, sometimes we asked her to stand under the trees, sometimes she would smile with flowers in her hands, sometimes she would sleep on the mat, sometimes she would row a light boat, rippling in the heart of the lake, sometimes she would ride a bicycle, speeding across the grass, and there were all her beautiful shadows in it. So we call her a movie star, not that she really went to a movie company to be a movie star." Wu Junsu said, "So that's how it is. I thought she had really been a movie star." Qu Wushuang said, "Not only that, but she is also very skilled at taking movies. Whenever there is a grand event that is going to be made into a movie, she often takes a cameraman and sets off together. So we have many movies in our newspaper office that are directed and collected by her." Just as she was saying that, a female photography technician walked in, holding a small camera in her hand, and walked to Qu Wushuang and said, "Miss Zhai! Can we take a picture?" Qu Wushuang said, "Sure." She raised her hand, and with a push of the camera button, a photo had already been taken. This kind of camera is probably still imported from abroad. Although there are also companies in China that manufacture cameras, they are not so smart. And in the past, when taking pictures indoors, it was necessary to use magnesium light or something, but now that photography has advanced, it is no longer necessary. Even during banquets, with a casual wave of the hand, the photo is already clearly taken. (266)</p>
