<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c15">不自由，無和平！ <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>聲隆隆，光閃閃，若斷若續。忽明忽暗；大風起處，只見點點綫綫的白十火花，飄飄搖搖，零零落落；一霎那間，萬象幻滅，萬籟靜寂。昨晚黃浦江頭突然有此夜景，迴光返照，在市人眼底心頭，誰都不免異樣感想！</p>
<p>自從一九三一年日本發動了軍事侵略，到現在第十年頭；一九三七年中國從事於全面抗戰，到現在歷卅四月，亦已第四年頭；在這期間內，以吾們記憶所及，日本人在上海燃放焰火，昨晚似是第二次。第一次在一九三八年十月杪，日軍佔領了漢口，遂忘形的自慶自賀。原來日本方面滿以為速戰速決，打到了南京，便得作城下之盟；它所鼓勵其軍隊人民的，亦即以南京為標準，、遂許下了唯一大願，不料中國攝住了他儘戰。日本方面因此小得不再許了第二個唯一大願，滿以為打到漢口，便得制華命脈，脅華屈服，而他自己亦得跳出泥淖，了此一局；雖事後纔知道中國抗戰的決心，纔領略中國抗戰的堅强，但在初佔漢口的時候，却錯覺為已經戰勝，即可凱旋。當時的破慳囊，放燄火，及今回想，何殊春夢；然當時的興高采烈，歡天喜地，則遠非昨晚所可幾及。</p>
<p>昨晚的燄火，大約徒使市人作廻光返照的感想吧！在日本國內，較為明達的人士，近來已能公然的論斷於南京改糾的不足以結束所謂「中國事變」。日本「特使」的遲遲其行，說明了日本當局由痴迷狀態入於半意識狀態。昨天密勒氏評論報紀述一個美國記者小遊南京歸來後的談話；謂在飲宴時，一個日本軍官亦以為「事情正多着呢」，透露了悲觀頹喪的意態；又在上海火車上遇見的日本衛兵，亦說「這件事很渺茫，頗難得到成果」。總而言之：日本將士朝野現在決不像年半前初佔漢口的時候，由錯覺而歡忻。日本將士朝野至少有其殘餘的意識，依然相當保持其理解與判斷的本能；縱使自行麻醉，跡近顚在，亦不致完全憂喜失常，而高興燃放什麼燄火；昨晚的燄火，祇是無可奈何的敷衍點綴而已。</p>
<p>詛咒是無益的，嘲諷是無益的，可是這些並非詛咒嘲諷，而是老實話。老實說：日本發動軍事侵略，是自始鑄成的大錯，到了計窮力竭，愈形心勞日拙，遂至所謀皆左，一無是處；枉費了心機，儘做絕望事，儘向絕路走；既無聊，亦無效。偽裝着興高采烈放燄火，雖曰末節，無關宏指，却亦萬目睽睽，眼見他自打巴掌充胖子。因為現在雖任何人不欲斷言現在的這一幕，究竟是在精衛上了日本人的當，還是日本人上了在精衛的當？但是任何人確信這一慕無益於中日問題的解決。日本人與在精衛以和平為標榜，但是日本人手裏拿了血淋淋的刀，汪精衛赤裸裸的沒有刀，在此局面之下，「和平之神」當然惟有迢遠的賞鑒燄火，迢遠的明哲保身，怎肯給他們做俘虜，給他們去賞鑒；故任何人皆確信和平無望。日汪標榜如彼，無望如此，然則焰火慶祝些什麼？</p>
<p>這不是「和平之神」故肆狡獪，不是「和平之神」冷侍了日汪；相反的「和平之神」必一視同仁的願意臨照中日，中國人亦人人願意歡迎和平之神」。這是日在之所深知，故以此標榜號召。但是小幸之至，日在知其一，不知其二。要知道；中國人倘若不顧一切，祗要和平，則老實說，自始便不抗戰了。中國倘若抗戰目的未得貫澈，祗要和平，則老實說，不待在精衛上塲，隨時可向日本取得和平。在精衛唱導和平，他以為戰爭必以和平為歸宿；殊不知戰爭為爭取戰爭的目的而戰爭，並非以和平為目的而戰爭；戰爭目的一日不能貫澈，則和平論據一日不能成立。他以為中國人樂於崇奉「和平之神」，他不知道「和平之神」祗是配享，祗是從祀；他不知道中國人所崇奉的正神楚「自由之神」。要知正神未到，祔祭那有座位；要知不自由，無和平！</p>

<p>斯科蘇聯人民外交委員會主席莫洛托夫、今日在蘇聯第六屆最高蘇維挨會議中發表演說、原詞如下、</p>
<p>莫洛托夫演辭全文</p>
<p>「各位代表同志、自上次蘇聯最高蘇維埃會議開會迄今、已五閱月於茲、在此短暫之時期中、國際上曾有關係重大之事件發生、是以吾人必須在此次最高蘇維埃會議中、檢討吾人之外交政策問題、　吾人欲檢討最近之國際情勢、必須注意去秋在中歐爆發之戰事、自戰事爆發迄今、英法集團與德國之　、尙無大戰發生、僅在海面及空中偶有接觸而巳、唯去年德國所表現之和平意向、巳為英法政府所峻拒、此乃衆所共知之事實、因此雙方均努力準備擴大戰事、德國自佔領某某鄰邦、團結德人八千萬之後、業巳增强其軍事力量、且已成為歐洲主要帝國主義國家英法之强敵矣、是以英法乃以履行對波義務為籍口、而向德宜戰、英法政府對德作戰之眞目的、與保障波蘭及捷克之目標相去幾何茲已彰彰甚明矣、事實上英法政府巳宣稱彼等作戰目的係粉碎德國、雖然、彼等現仍以保衛「民主」國家、及維護「小國」權益等口號、掩飾彼等之眞正目的、同時由於蘇聯拒絕、英法之反德政策、彼等仇視蘇聯之態度乃更趨明顯、而充分證明帝國主義仇視社會主義國主之政策、</p>
<p>當芬蘭戰事開始後、英法帝國主義即準備以此作為向蘇聯作戰之開始點同時並仍利用瑞典與挪威參加此項戰爭、蘇聯對正在擴展中之歐戰、其態度早為各方所明瞭、蘇聯之和平政策、在此次歐戰中有充分的證明、在歐戰爆發之初、蘇聯即宣佈其中立政策、並表示在此次戰事中始終追隨該項政策、</p>
<p>蘇德關係增進英法仇蘇明顯</p>
<p>蘇德關係之增進、巳在去年八月所簽訂之不侵犯公約獲得明證、此種新的良好關係、巳在前波蘭事件中益為增强、其力量之偉大、亦巳獲得證明、蘇德經濟關係之發展、已山一九三九年八月及一九四〇年二月所簽訂之貿易協定加以證明、目前蘇德兩國之貿易　巳增加、將來大有進一步發展之可能、在另一方面、吾人與英法關係則反乎上述情形、由於蘇聯小願被英法帝國主義利用為彼　向德國作戰及獲得世界盟主之工具、吾人巳引起彼等對吾國之仇視、此種仇視態度其最甚者、巳在芬蘭戰事中暴露關於芬蘭問題、余將另加解釋、在過去數月中、英法之反蘇政策、更有其他事實為之證明、兩月前法當局竟令警察搜査吾國駐巴黎之商務代表機關、法警察雖作極詳盡之搜査、但仍一無所獲、結果祇使發起者大失面子、而證明此種仇視吾國之態度、實屬毫無理由、關於召回吾國駐法大使蘇里資事、法政府竟企圖覓尋各種偽造藉口、對蘇聯表示仇視、吾人為表示已不重視與法關係起見、業已召回蘇氏、</p>
<p>又關於英艦在遠東方面扣留吾國駛赴海參崴之商輪兩艘同題、（該輪載有自中國及美國購得之貨品）以及英方拒絕交付訂貨等等、各種事實、均係英法仇視蘇聯之明證、雖然、英法方面竟企圖使彼等之仇視政策合理化、彼等竟指吾人與德國進行貿易、無異協助德方向彼等作戰、此種爭辯固不値一笑、吾人現試以德蘇及德羅（羅馬尼亞關係作一比較、雜對德貿易佔其本國對外貿易之一半、羅馬尼亞輸往德國之貨物、較諸蘇聯多出數倍、（根據蘇羅兩國各個之國家產量比例）然則、英法並未仇視羅馬尼亞、更未要求羅馬尼亞停止與德國進行貿易、英法對蘇聯之態度則不同、因此、英法之所以仇視蘇聯、決非由於吾人與德國港行貿易、其癥結所在、實係吾人不尤被英法統治階級所利用向德作戰、英法為報復起見、乃對吾人採取仇視態度、吾人對英法絕無不友誼之行為、但彼等則已採取各種敵對行動、</p>
<p>至於英法所傳紅軍「進攻印度」及「進攻東方」之荒謬謠言、決無人置信苟有人竟深信此種謠言、則其人必巳失去理智矣、蘇聯之中立政策、絕不為英法統治階級所歡迎、此點極為明顯，其决、彼等之神經已不甚正常、彼等企圖迫使吾人對德採取仇視及戰爭行為、利用吾人使其獲得帝國主義之目標，英法紳士須知蘇聯絕對未曾同時亦不致為他人所利用、蘇聯始終追隨其本身政策、無論他國紳士是否贊同、此種政策絕不致有所變動、</p>
<p>對芬戰事意義保障本國安全</p>
<p>余現將提及芬蘭問題、芬蘭三個月戰事之眞正意義果何在耶、此次戰事係由於吾人保衛西北邊境（尤其是列寗格勒）之迫切需要、關於此點、諸君諒早已洞悉、去年十月及十一月、蘇聯政府屢决與芬蘭政府商討保障吾國（尤其是列寗格勒）之安全辦法、鑒於國際形勢之日趨惡劣、吾人認為此種商討、實屬極為需要而迫切、由於芬政府之不友誼態度、該項會談毫然結果、於是蘇芬戰事　不可免、吾人敢言、茍芬蘭不為外國勢力所把持、苟芬蘭未對蘇採取仇視態度、則蘇芬必可用和平方法解決糾紛、蘇聯政府當時曾作最低限度之請求、不料仍未能行外交方式解決該項糾紛、芬蘭戰事現旣己結束、且蘇芬業巳簽訂和約、吾人應以不容否認之事實、指明芬蘭戰事之重要性、此種事實為列寗格勒附近及喀萊里亞士峽全部、芬蘭當局已築成堅固之堡壘、內藏大砲及機關槍、此種堡壘不下數千座、有燧道使其通達後方、四週並設有陷落坦克車之戰壕及各種障礙、如地雷等等、此外更有出外國專家築成之孟納興陣綫、其式樣搆造、一若馬奇諾及齊格菲陣綫、芬蘭當局認為任何軍隊均不能衝破該陣綫、同時彼等並將該處每一鄉鎭均易為堅固陣地、又在芬蘭東部及南部、芬當局均建有直達吾人邊境之鐵道及公路、（此項公路在經濟上毫無重要性）</p>
<p>簡言之、在一九三九年時、芬蘭（尤其是喀萊里亞土峽）已易為軍事要地、俾第三强國可利用該處進攻列寗格勒及蘇聯、由是觀之、芬蘭去秋對吾人之仇視、絕非偶然、事實上仇視蘇聯之軍隊、巳在芬蘭築成堅固陣地、一俟局勢對蘇不利、彼等即開始行動、蘇聯紅軍業已粉碎孟納興陣綫、獲得無上光榮、蓋在困難情形下、非紅軍不克臻此也、同時紅軍並已摧毀進攻列寗格勒之軍事根據地、不特此也、紅軍且已擊破若干第三國在過失數年中所進行之反　計劃、</p>

<p>「芬蘭政府及軍事當局對吾國之仇恨、亦可由芬蘭白衛隊對受傷紅軍之暴行略見其程度之深、例如芬蘭白衛隊曾在拉多加湖以北包圍我方傷兵醫院之防空壕、壕中有重傷將士一百二十名、均被擊斃、其中有被焚斃者、有腦殼被擊碎者、餘　或被刺斃或被槍斃、除受重傷之外、在該處及他處陣亡之將士、多頭部被擊、或受刺刀之致命傷、一部被擊斃命之將士、面部均有刀傷、一部屍體業已身首異處、而頭顱則巳不知去向矣、至被芬蘭白衛隊所俘之救護隊員、亦多遭遇令人不敢置信之殘暴行為、有一部屍身被縛樹上、而頭則被斬去、此等野蠻之殘暴行為、均為芬蘭白衛隊企圖煽動民衆痛恨吾國所產生之結果、此乃芬蘭擁護「西方文明」者之眞面目也、芬蘭戰事非僅與芬軍作戰、此點亦不難明瞭、事實眞相實較此猶為複雜也、吾軍所遇者非僅芬軍而已、而為英法及其他帝國主義者之聯合軍力也、彼等以各種武器·飛機大砲·偽裝之「義勇隊」·金錢及各種軍需品接濟芬蘭之小資本家、並向全世界作在熱之宣傳、其目的乃欲以各種方法、企圖引起反蘇戰爭、在此蘇聯敵人咆哮聲中、其最吵閙者厥為第二國際妓女「社會主義派」之悲鳴、以及阿特里·白魯姆·資本家奴役的呼號、</p>

<p>三月十九日英首相張伯倫在下院演說時、非特對未能消弭芬蘭戰禍表示惡意之遺憾、藉以將　「愛好和平」之帝國主義心腸、顯示全世界人士、且巳對如何煽動芬蘭向蘇聯作戰一點加以說明、彼發表英國所尤許及實際已運往芬蘭之軍火數字如下、英國尤許以一百五十二架飛機運往芬蘭、實際已運至芬蘭者為一〇一架、又大砲一項、英國所尤許者為　　三尊、運至芬蘭實數為一一四尊、英國所尤許之砲彈為二九七·〇〇〇枚、但運至芬蘭祗有一八五·〇〇〇枚、運抵芬蘭之維克斯槍為一〇〇架、此外運至芬蘭之飛機炸彈為一五·七〇〇枚、（英國事光尤許以二二·七〇〇枚運至芬蘭）、此外炸坦克車之地雷由英運抵芬蘭共萬枚、適為英國事先尤許者之半數、張氏以毫無愧巴之態度續云、「英國此次準備出征工作極為神速、在三月初、征討軍十萬人即準備赴芬蘭、（較孟納興所要求者提早兩個月）且以後仍將有軍隊遣至芬蘭、査此種坦白之承認、即為酷愛和平英國帝國主義之眞面目、</p>
<p>至於法國、吾人自法報探悉法方巳將飛機一七九架、大砲四七二尊、砲彈七九五·〇〇〇枚、機槍五·一〇〇架、手溜彈二十萬枚運至芬蘭、三月十一日前法總理達賴第在議院宜稱、「在以軍火援助芬蘭各國中、法國居第一位、同時為接受芬京要求、法國已將最新式之轟炸機運抵芬蘭、」達氏續稱「自　月二十六日起、法方軍隊即已準備完畢待命出發至芬蘭、」法輪準備出動運兵至芬蘭者巳有數艘、達氏復謂、「協約國決盡力援助芬蘭、」達氏此種演詞已失去其淸醒之理智、故殊無詳加討論之必要、</p>
<p>父瑞典在芬戰地位一層、亦有論述之必要、根據埔典報紙所載、瑞方所供給芬蘭之飛機、佔瑞典本身空軍力量五分之一、另據瑞典陸軍部長聲稱、「芬蘭已自瑞典獲得步槍八萬四千枝、機槍五七五架、大砲三百尊、手溜彈三萬枚及子彈五千萬枚、此種軍火均為最新式之戰爭利器、」</p>

<p>美國所盛行者為憎惡法西斯主義之情緖、尤其是對希特勒元首及與國社主義有關之事物、宣傳機關幾全在猶太八之手中、無綫電影片日報及刊物受彼等節制、幾佔百分之百、彼　雖竭盡描寫德國黑暗情形之能事、如宗敎迫害以及集中營之情形、但美國民衆究與歐洲局勢隔膜、故亦未著成效、目前美國民衆已視希特勒及國社主義為世間最惡毒之威脅、但此種計劃週密之反國社主義運動、對於蘇聯則並不涉及之、此外、美國復製造戰爭心理、使美國民衆相信歐洲和平巳瀕於危殆、戰爭已屬不可避免、且謂倘世界大戰爆發、則美國為保護世界之自由及民主政治、亦須參預作戰、羅斯福總統為表示憎惡法西斯主義之第一人、其作用有二、（一）羅斯福總統鑒於內政問題之複雜與困難、尤其是勞資鬥爭問題、故倡反法西斯主義之理論、轉移民衆對內政問題之注意力、（二）美國之製造戰爭心理及歐洲和平危機之說乃欲民衆接受超過美國國防上所需要之巨大軍備計劃、美國之反國社主義情緒更因德國對待猶太人之嚴酷態度、以及移殖問題而益見其甚、猶太智識階級如紐約州長包魯區·新任最高法院法官弗郞克孚特·財政部長摩根韜·曁羅斯福總統之其他猶太友人、均參與該項運動、彼等咸欲擁護羅斯輻總統為人權宗敎及言論自由之保障者、此輩在美國政府身居要職之猶太人、雖裝作「保護民主政治」之姿態、究其實際與猶太國際有不可分離之聯繫、按猶太國際亦為其種族謀利益、今擁護羅斯福總統為「人權之保障者」、亦屬狡猾已極、總之、為掩飾美國內政之困難、而轉移美國民衆反猶之注意力於反法西斯主義、乃屬極取巧之能事云、波蘭駐美大使波托基簽字、</p>
<p>第四件</p>
<p>柏林德國外交部頃公布在波蘭外交部中所抄獲具有重大價値之第四件公文、為波蘭駐法京大使盧卡斯維資、於一九三九年二月一日自巴黎發予波蘭外交部長之報吿、其原文如决、「法國議會關於討論法國現今外交政策一事、於昨日討論終止、其結果達拉第政府之信任以三七九票對二三四票表決、以現今之情形、使余不得不有所建議關於波法關係及波法之公約、余（盧卡斯維資自稱）憶及於一九三八年十二月十七日報吿中、曾提及自九月事件、即簽訂法德立不侵犯宣言後、法國政界人士對波法關係更為銳視、自此以後法國報章亦多載及法波問題、法國左派及右派人士均有所論列、昔時法國仇視波蘭之態度、自九月事件後業經消除、較合理之論調亦時現於目前、於茲時法國國際地位日趨惡化、尤其自閣下（指波外長在蒙特卡洛城往貝許特期開登鎭謁見德元首希特勒後、此間報界及政界人士咸評論法外長龐萊對波蘭之外交政策、報章上指責外長龐萊在閣下訪問法國南部時、龐萊未能利用該項機會鑄成波法兩國較密切之政治關係、自閣下離開貝許特斯開登鎮後、此間報章則直接攻擊法外長龐萊措置失當、此後法外長龐萊為避免受人攻擊起見、曾盛稱波蘭國內局勢之窘困、及波蘭將受德人之威脅、然而法國人士不但明瞭德波關係並未惡化、抑且波蘭並未受德元首希特勒烏克蘭行動之威脅、同時義大利國內盛行反法運動、使法國欲義大利加入所謂「帝國政策」之希望化為烏有、在此種空氣之下、法外長龐萊在衆議院所提報吿、使各議員引為大不滿　、認為太過平淡無奇、所幸法　　演說詞句當能激起議員之愛國心、而使信任案以三七九票對二三四　獲得通過云、波蘭　法大使　十斯維　簽字</p>

<p>巴黎蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫昨所發表之演說、頃由此間政界人士加以評論、咸謂其要點有二、（一）芬蘭應在政治上賡續中立化、（二）羅馬尼亞佔據貝薩拉比亞省、（上决歐戰前屬於俄國）蘇聯從未加以承認、自未便與羅國簽訂互不侵犯條約、蘇聯此後政策似將以此二點為基礎、關於第二點、羅國所處地位至為鮮明、緣蘇聯曾於一九三三年與羅國暨其他各國簽訂多邊公約、為侵略國下一定議、實已接受尊重羅國現行疆界之約束、此在英法兩國政府對於蘇聯政策之發展、仍持以鎭靜的態度、蓋蘇聯與德國相接近一事、必須出以利於德國之實際行動、始足以引起英法兩國之不安、此際蘇聯在經濟政治上究將如何舉動、尙不可知、是以英法兩國暫以靜觀為事、遇必要時、自當相機予以應付云、（卅日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎法國「强毅報」載倫教訪電、據稱、英法最高軍事會議昨日集會時、巳作加緊協約國對德封鎖之最後決定、前巳解決者僅在海洋方面、今則從陸地立塲、討論此問題、所有與德國相通之商業路綫、今皆將一律封鎖、此種新計劃不久即將付諸實施、經濟戰爭今巳開始、德國濫用他國之中立、英法於此不能始終漠視、協約國所將採用之方法、或使若干國稍感不便、並使其他若干國稍受危險云、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎此間政界人士頃談稱、英法國防最高委員會聯席會議昨所發表之宣言、巳使歐洲各國發生深刻印象、北歐各國亦巳改採較合現實之觀點、以挪威而論、德潛艇U二十一號在北海駛入挪威領海、襲擊英國艦船、已被挪威當局加以扣留、該國能採取强硬行動以維護其權利、可於此事見之、至於德國擬拉攏蘇義兩國、簽訂三角公約一項計劃顯巳失敗、爰又努力設法拉攏義大利匈牙利南斯拉夫三國、以冀成立四角公約、其中匈國受德國之壓迫、或有加入之可能、但南國決不就範、觀於該國各報之論調、對於德義兩國均不表示信任、，即可知之云、（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>「新政權」昨日在南京開始、兩租界實施特別戒備一天、封鎖不必要馬路橋樑、無軌電車縮短行程、茲探誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3 id="c46">強迫遊行人數寥落 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>日方自侵華軍興以來，國內之人力、物力、財力、早已呈現竭蹶不支狀態、人民之厭戰、日甚一日、為此特由日軍一手包辦「新政權」、以為鼓吹和平之張本、昨日為「新政權」在南京開始日期、本市各大小組織、分別在南市·閘北·浦東·虹口·滬西·市中心區·舉行「慶祝」糾合苦力孩童婦孺遊行示威、惟多數遭受拒絕、故每區遊行者僅寥寥數十人、</p>
<p>租界戒備　防軍出動</p>
<p>兩租界警務當局、因恐反　分子闖入租界擾亂秩序或其他活動、故經前晚會議講決定於昨日實施特別戒備一天、除動員全體警捕探員外、並出動萬國商團及各國駐滬防軍、以英軍維持處洽　路東外灘以西·愛多亞路北·蘇州河南·及沿浜北一帶區域、美軍擔任虞洽　路西·小沙渡　東·福煦路北·勞勃生路南北段、意軍負責小沙渡路以西及全部越界地段防務、法軍擔任法租界全部之秩序、</p>
<p>斷絕交通　搜檢嚴厲</p>
<p>此外並將沿愛多亞路　熙路非必要馬路、如江西路、朱葆三路、吉祥街、紫萊街、帶鈎橋、麥底安路、磨坊街、雲南路、廣西路、東西自來火街、八里橋街、龍門路、淡水路、重慶路、白爾路、慕　鳴路、邁爾西愛路　馬路、一律置鐵絲網、斷絕交通、僅外灘四川路天主堂街、河南路、老北門街、福建路、鄭家木橋、東新橋、大世界、同孚路、聖母院路、西摩路、大西路等處　行、實施搜查、</p>
<p>封鎖橋樑　縮短路綫</p>
<p>同時、並將沿蘇州河之橋樑、如自來水橋、盆湯弄橋、西藏路橋、亦一律封鎖、僅天后宮橋行人車輛、均　通行、老閘橋祗准行人通過、浙江路橋祗准車輛行駛、在通行各橋之兩堍、亦派有大批探捕、實施搜查、即公共汽車電車、亦須受檢、其情形較「二八」幾年更為嚴密、英商十六路無軌電車本行使於三洋涇橋曹家渡間、今因勞勃生路鐵門封閉、故臨時縮短行程、在小沙渡路、勞勃生路口掉頭、十八路無軌電車本駛大世界北站間、因西藏路橋封閉、故在泥城橋轉彎、經由北京路天后宮橋向北、</p>
<p>鐵甲車隊　緊密巡邏</p>
<p>除各馬路橋樑特別戒備外、另由男女檢查員、車訊對、鐵甲車隊、駐軍巡查隊、往來巡行各馬路、無注意昆連華界區域、故在西區派有大批警備車預備隊鋼甲汽車、實施防範、過去每晨五時、即可在路行走、昨日則依照戒嚴法令、於六時正、始准自由往返、電車公共汽車、亦延遲至五時三刻出廠、入晚十二時半、即不准無通行證許可證者往來、眼裡執行　禁法令、今晨零時起、始撤銷緊急措置、恢復原有狀態、</p>
<p>虹口日方　亦施戒備</p>
<p>至於日方因　愛國份子在其佔領區域活動、故在水陸各要口及虹口各橋樑、如鴨綠路橋、中虹橋、裏虹橋、外虹橋、橫浜橋、嘉興路橋、各區、增派崗位、搜查行人及車輛、租界部隊並三五成羣、在蘇州河北英日警備地區北江西路北河南路一帶、往來巡查、</p>
<p>出租汽車　迫貼旗幟</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（卅日）本市各出租汽車公司之若干汽車上、被迫黏有偽「新政權」宣傳之旗幟、引起一般華籍乘客之憤懣、但司機及汽車公司方面因遭恫嚇、未敢撕去此等旗幟、事緣今日清晨、大道警察在界外馬路區見汽車公司內跳舞場與賭窟前、以及行駛途中之出租汽車、盡加攔阻、在各車擋風玻璃窗上黏國民黨旗、並在車後窗上黏黃色三角旗、上有「和平建國」字樣、然後向司機警告、今日不得撕去此等旗幟、否則一經發現、將對司機等施以極不愉快之懲戒、司機無奈、故當乘客見此旗幟、多要求撕去、竟不從命、記者頃以此事叩諸公共租界警務處長包文少校、據答稱、警務處對此事抱中立之見解、無需加以干涉、車上旗幟是否撕去、應由汽車公司決定、</p>

<p>機頭與三等車二節、傾側於鐵軌外、乘客無首重傷者、若干人稍有擦傷、無需入醫院治療、鐵路人員解釋此次肇事原因、歸咎於該段鐵路之修理疏忽、謂失事處曾於昨晨從事修理云、旋有新機頭一輛駛到、曳該列快車繼續前駛、</p>

<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊需要父殷、蓋杳港金價突漲、烚赤暗市隨之激升故也、英金票上午頗多佻給、午後突轉堅挺、美金票又因鎊價趨軟、一般復起爭購、晨即高至十六元二角七分、後以獲利者稍有吐售、市價一度回軟、但旋即步漲、晚市高至十六元四角二分、香港票趨勢仍軟、法郞票稍有供給、荷蘭票及斐律濱票需要尙殷、日金票巳轉漲勢、晚巿為一元二角八分五厘、朝鮮票又出一元關、晚市為一元〇〇五厘、昨日巿價、計英美金鎊各漲一元、英金票及荷蘭票各升一角、斐律濱票漲五分、美金票漲二角六分、香港票降五厘、法郞票小　厘、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3 id="c85">貼現再升五元 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、步升突銳、每千元之貼率、突出六十元外、上午由六十一元半、步高達六十四元、午後頗平、仍六十四元、再軋升五元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩巿均仍掛一角八分未更云、</p>
<h3 id="c86">糧食　暹邏米　二萬八千餘包 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>昨晨米市、因本客各帮繼續暢辦、各色洋米曾一度升半元至六七角不等、做開一號西貢四十四元五角、二號四十一元、火絞四十三元半、小絞四十元、不過浮囤散戶、巳不若前者之堅、旣未拉進、且將手中獲利貨乘高回出、擁擠非凡、頓感供過於求、致引起作客方面顧忌、無論內地帮及本鄕店　不敢貿然再進、袖手觀望、銷塲漸懈、市貨愈多、大局遂反昂回疲、各貨行情步步下降、結果不但將早市所升者悉數貶去、且更跌透六七角不一、計收盤一號西貢巳僅四十三元半、二號四十元、三十九元八角、火絞四十三元、四十二元半、小絞三十九元一二角、三十九元、祇有混合碎及米菉以市貨無多、去路又廣、始終不懈、猶增半元左右、至於糯米早間雖曾一度帶緊、但後遭洋米牽制、並見回軟、若溧陽特元售三十八元半較之前市亦小四五角、其厚薄梗等國米塲外暗盤、聞亦先緊後疲、不過結果適成平平、與前相仿云云、</p>
<p>大批洋米繼續到滬、昨有丹商　成洋行之Nuihock美和輪、自暹羅運來洋米二千五百噸、計二萬八千餘包、於昨日下午四時半進口、六時許駛至虹口公和祥碼頭停靠、定今晨開始起卸、今日有洋米二千五百六十六包、裝怡和洋行怡生輪、運往烟台、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米晨間實銷活潑、內地帮繼續購辦外、南北客帮亦有到市問津、貨方隨在金昂滙低、新定不劃下、再度抬高、西貢暹羅大小絞火絞等高次各檔一致拉起一元左右、然價昂後即有浮戶吐出、又被期貨出籠影響、現米午市巳回小三四角、回籠期貨有浮多散客塞出、早市未能與現米同時上漲、午後賣氣一旺巿即銳落、故回籠期米反比前日小五六角、二號西貢最高五十元、下午十至四十九元二角、小絞四十八元半、一度喊四十九元、下午小至四十七元二角、一號西貢則開五十二元七角至五角、全日成交期貨五六百噸、現米五千包、又洋米之英華司原包售價如下、</p>

<p>無錫米稻市况、自二十九日轉晴、稻船絡繹而來、可商包　轉趨觀望、雖有米碾業抖售、須待前訂手續、將貨解淸再談、一部份售主亟求脫卸、連日米價急轉直瀉、高白粳每石自二十六元五角小至二十五元關內、高糙從二十五元低至二十四元內、跌落一元三五角之多、粳稻每石十三元、跌至十二元三角、稻價小去七八角至一元、二十九日市糙白粳復起五六角、査今歲紅盤以來、米聯會代同業分批賣與日商之米、先後有七萬餘石、以及本巿大批飯米、連同平米、共計有十萬石强、照例抵銷過年存棧稻軟二十餘萬担、以目前各棧行廠存稻、當有近六十萬担、可見今春新正以來、到源不弱、若無日商大批去路、存積加厚、米價勢必再跌也、（良）</p>

<p>麵粉昨市平靜、蓋自平賣粉滿期後、廠盤即提增為十三元八角、致本街零銷日淸、各號零批每日僅五六千包、客帮去化如北洋天津等處、販運難於合劃、且客盤尙有十五元之高價、故交易沉寂、回籠粉老車牌初開十三元七角二分、下午開價十三元七角、比前略疲數分、因籌碼巳枯、一時不易過鬆聞兵船牌轉棧貨、因未能出口、　祇十三元三角、雙獅牌十三元二角二分、廠盤則仍須十三元八角、又麵粉今有三千三百包、運往烟台、</p>
<p>小麥昨巿亦見平靜、査近來銀根關係、新囤戶久乏問津出口帮與日廠亦鮮辦意、聞阜豐廠新到定麥一船、額計六千餘噸、刻正在起卸、下月初尙有美麥八千餘噸、即可抵滬、其餘亦將絡繹而至、惟國麥情勢、究緣存到兩枯、在此新陳不接之際、一時尙不易過鬆、昨有阜豐辦去常州麥一千包、價仍為二十三元五角云、</p>

<p>紗市續升、漲風劇烈、此因香港帮直接向申新九廠承購二十支雙馬紗即裝價為九百八十元現紗、於是人心激昂、有一部份買意愈强、檯面尤覺乾枯、市價乃步步前進、二十支雙馬四月份價始做一千〇四十五元、收盤價為一千〇六十一元、比上日漲二十一元、但海外印美棉市甚弱、所以拋賣者亦不乏其人耳、上日申新廠開出二十支雙馬一千包，價為九百八十元、又二十支新天女一百五十包、價為九百八十八元、均現鈔、為香港帮買去、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市情穩定、聞英美匯兌轉縮、形勢略緊、廿支雙馬四月份為一千〇四十五元、旋聞美匯趨硬、多方活動甚力、且紛紛購進加碼、市價節節上升、達一千〇六十四元、收盤後回小三四元、聞午後父勗、査全日間成交統計三千五百六十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲二十一元、三十一日有棉紗十八件運烟臺、四白十五件運香港、一百十五件運廣州灣、十件運海口、七百二十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易甚淸、廠方絕無起色之象、故紗市雖步步上升、棉市絲毫未有牽動、此因即棉日落、價格較糜之故也、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉巿價、紐約棉市昨晨初殊為平靜、然市况尙稱堅定，後因現貨之賣出、及一部份海外棉商之在巿拋賣、市况因而轉疲、結果收盤價格近期漲二磅音、遠期降四磅音、印度昨日連同預測降一羅比、埃及平穩、</p>
<p>滬現外棉交易、各方俱以月終關係、且市上銀根頗緊、同業間對於原棉交易、購意殊為淡薄、廠方則始終無意購辦、日內恐難有起色之望、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元〇六二五、折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>昨日黃豆交易甚稀、蓋因購戶有以為此後來源、或　疏通之望、相率觀望、似欲期待、但貨主則認為搬運陣碍、未必即能消除、故都堅持、不肯鬆脫、是以市面僵持、殊少做開、統市僅由本街零戶略點綴蕪湖黃豆二百包、安慶黃豆一百餘包、崇明沙黃八十包、江北靑豆一車、價與前市未有軒輊、</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>新生活運動，是全體國民之生活革新運動，民國二十三年，蔣委員長在南昌行營所發起，其宗旨在滌除我國國民不合時代，不適環境之習性，使趨向於適合時代，與環境之生活，質言之，即求國民生活之合理化，而以中華民族固有之舊道德，禮，義，廉，恥，為日常生活之規律，此項運動，由新生活運動促進會主持之，今已推行及於全國，戰前之新生活運動，絢爛一時！然而；眞眞能實踐新生活規律者，能有幾人？戰後之上海孤島，新生活規律，民衆早巳拋之九霄雲外！生活之享受，是窮奢，極欲！酒樓，舞榭，笙歌鼎沸！，里弄，屋角，雀牌　喧！以環境特殊為藉口？度其糜爛生活！至於意志之頺唐！精神之萎靡！外人見而嘆為奇蹟！以前方忠勇將士，正在拚命衛國，拋頭顱！洒熱血之時！　遠離祖國懷抱之上海孤島，竟有如此荒唐現象？豈不是奇躋？至於家破流亡之被難同胞！寄居在收容所中，生活反有規律，　陋之食，破舊之衣，如難民生產機關之作息有時，合羣生活之紀律化，合理化，精神之嚴肅緊張，是確能配合大時代，符合新生活者。以難胞身受戰禍之慘酷，人各有同仇敵愾之心，與苦刻生活之實踐！唯其如此，難胞羣中，未嘗見有寡廉鮮恥之事，而所謂智識階級，而所謂富商，鉅！，惟知蠅營，狗苟，囤積居奇，旣不知「禮一，父不知「義」，貪汚無恥，至今日而益變本加厲，莫可挽救矣！孔子云：禮，義，廉，恥，國之四維，四維不張，國乃滅亡！歷觀宋，　，上有寡廉，鮮恥之奸佞，下有渾渾噩噩之人民，尋致河山斷送！民為奴隸！可不懼哉</p>
<p>新生活運動，是起衰振微，嚴肅自己，約束自己，刻苦目己之革新運動！復興運動！人人站在自己崗位上，埋頭自己之工作，崇禮，義，知廉，恥，守紀律，負責任，是要躬行實踐，必須做到之事，非但在國族危難時期是如此，即在完成抗勝，建國之上業後，亦須如此！</p>
<p>新生活運動，最需要者，是尊重自己節操，要時時刻刻想到國難家仇！國其復（光復）乎？家其興乎？臥薪嘗胆，戮力奮鬥以赴之，戒除嗜好，（如烟，酒，等）屛絕娛樂，食粗肴，衣土布，務使生活軍隊化！起居合理化！節儉，耐勞，鍛鍊精神！多讀古聖賢，忠臣史書，修養自己之人格，　威武不屈，利誘不從，貧賤不移」，務須拳拳服膺！筆者行文至此，又想起從前伯夷，叔齊，（孤竹君之二子）因恥食周粟而採薇於首陽山，雖尋致餓死，而其人格精神，至今猶虎虎有生氣！誠　國可亡？而志不可失！志不失而國未必亡！志失而國亦終不可救矣，實踐新生活規律。掃除舊腐化習性，即是自救教國，易言之，救國即所以救己，幸勿沉湎於聲，色，犬，馬之中，自己埋葬自己，為外人輕視也可。</p>
<h3 id="c98">桂林的新生活 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 新虛</p>
<p>人是充滿了強毅活潑　都市是充滿了整齊清潔</p>
<p>提到桂林，第一使人贊揚的，就是所謂新生活了。這裏的人的樸素和强健是非外省人所能及到的。强健本來是般廣西人的特性，他們的身體，看去雖然短小，却如鐵一般的結實，深褐色的面孔，表示他們是飽受了陽光，充分吸取着紫外綫的；人走起路來，都直挺挺地，全身似乎是充滿了生命力，有一種偉大無畏的氣概。近幾年來，由於市政府當局不斷努力推行新生活運動的結果，整個桂林市面，無論在衣食住行以及其他各方面，都合乎新生活的原則，充滿着蓬勃的朝氣。</p>
<p>巿民的服裝，異常樸素，他們衣料多購用的是本地灰布，在街上你便可以看見大多數人穿的都是一套灰布中山服，只是熨的一點縐紋也沒有，十分整齊潔靜；脚下一雙並不昂貴的皮靴，帽子是通常的便帽；若是冬天，還加上一件深色布料的大衣，這便是普通人的模樣。至於軍人，穿的便是深藍色的綫布，不是灰布了，從長官直到兵士都是一樣。摩登女子在這裏雖不能絕無，但確也少有；學校中的女生，從不見一個穿上華麗的衣服；男生人人都着靑色制服，整整齊齊，帽子是和軍帽一樣，—不，他們週身都軍人化了，一看那模樣，褐色的面孔，非常强健的，和軍人大致沒甚分別，除了制服的顏色而外。不僅模樣如此，他們的生活，也確是軍人化的，無論在課堂，在宿舍都可以見到；牀上除了舖的一條席子和被窩外，甚麼也沒有，並且冬夏天都是如此。桂林市內，還有一個特點，便是市民禁止燙髮，穿高跟皮鞋的，被視為妓女，所以普通市民，都不穿高跟鞋的。</p>
<p>兩廣人對於飲食衛生的重視，是最著名的。桂林當然不能例外，更由於當局的嚴加管理，普通一般飲食店中都有專門査究衛生人員檢查，每屆夏令時，總有一個大規模的飲食衛生運動，被騐後有病菌的食品，除監督店中消毒外，還要罰款，作為破壞市民健康的懲戒。夏天咖啡店所出售的汽水和冰淇淋，比較說來還合衛生。此外，淸晨小菜塲的鮮肉魚貨灘，擺設有規定時間和規定地方。</p>
<p>市民起居，向來是早起早眠，自新生活推行以來，起得更早了。起身後散步，操練，深呼吸，也有很多市民，習慣於清晨練習跑步的，所以，在桂林的早晨，每條街上，總有很多的人在大闊步地奔跑，這一點也許是所以廣西的人大多數是堅結健實的。市民住屋，矮小而整潔，屋內的陳設，大多是雅緻淸潔，舶來品是幾乎絕跡的。街上巿房的招貼，也不像上海的雜亂零落。市民在巿政府衛生處指導之下，每季實行淸除洗掃住房一次。</p>
<p>關於市民行的方面，除警察局所項佈的交通規則外，還有很大的警吿牌「靠左邊走」滿佈在街頭巷尾的電桿上；如果你一留神，靠着街的右邊走，那便有一個「交通人」來指正你的。桂林街上，是很難被你發見一輛人力車的，至於北方一帶用的轎子，更不曾見過。這因為他們都是強健耐勞，不忍用人來拖或抬自己，他們走起路來，只見頭也不回的向前衝，但是怪有精神的。桂林地方的居民，對於集會，散會，購票，都是魚貫而行，從來沒有絲毫衝突發生的。</p>
<p>新生活標織為盾形：盾之意義表示自衛。盾之中心為「指南針」其意義表示生活有一定之準則。盾之面有紅黃藍白四色，紅色表示奮鬥，熱烈，勇敢進取之精神。黃色表示光明大公無私之態度，藍白為靑天白日之意義。</p>

<p>— 麥隆</p>
<p>五六年前的華北政委會，甘頒佈一隻八德歌，頗有意義。茲把歌詞抄錄於下：</p>
<p>孝—好國民，八德首歌兮孝雙親，孝雙親，柔順承志兮定省勤，慈烏尙能知反哺，飛鳥日夜念勞辛，國民國民，時時都要記在心，孝順父母便是好國民。</p>

<h3 id="c100">新都婦女「四要」信條 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 燕姐</p>
<p>在戰時的新都—重慶，我們的婦女們對於「新生活運動」有着熱烈的推行和實現的氣象呈着；她們怎樣的實行呢？道有着她們「四要」的信條；現寫在下面，好　「孤島」的婦女們作為借鏡吧。</p>
<p>（一）要有信仰心理</p>
<p>她們大家相信新生活運動，確是救國家救民族救自己的良好方法，然後新生活運動才能發生力量。</p>
<p>（二）要有推行的決心</p>
<p>她們認為社會一切事情，都是因小而大，先近而遠的。但是中國許多人，都犯着能言不能行的重大毛病，所以要除掉了這種惡劣習慣，下着很大的決心和犧牲，才能進行無阻。</p>
<p>（三）要持之有恒</p>
<p>她們深感中國人五分鐘熱度，早巳騰笑萬邦。却認為推行新生活運動，如果祇是今日提倡，而明日便忘記了，又有甚麽用處呢？所以新都婦女們認為應該以有恒的心理，時時刻鼓勵自己以及勸導家人子女，使各人都能兢兢惕惕的不忘，而時刻的在努力推行。這樣，新生活運動，才會向「一日新，日日新」的光明路上走。</p>
<p>（四）要推己及人</p>
<p>婦女的天性，是和藹仁厚，同時也是家庭中的樞紐。如果事事能够以身作則，推己及人；不但能以慈愛勸導其子女，能以至誠感動其戚友，能以模範表率其鄰里；而且可以推及大衆，風動全國了。</p>
<h3 id="c101">新生活與防癆 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>我國肺病的多，當然是由於公共衛生的欠缺，和一切防癆設施的還沒有普及，這是母庸諱言的，但是一般病家的所以往往招致悲慘的結果，却並不由於上述的關係，而另有兩個最大的原因，一是病者的因循自誤，一是病者的過於信賴醫藥。</p>
<p>因循自誤和信賴藥物，是我國一般肺病患者的通病，原因是由於他們還沒有知道早期診斷和適當治療的重要，所以一誤再誤，當此防癆聲中，為减少一般因肺病而遭受悲慘的痛苦，實在不得不撞着晨鐘，擊着暮鼓，來喚醒一下，使大家對於早期診斷乃早期治療有深切的瞭解。</p>
<p>（一）早期診斷，因為肺病發覺得越早，治療方面越容易，而痊愈和回復健康也越快，非但自已免受一切痛苦，同時對於他人，還可减少傳染，所以這種早期診斷，對於保障個人健康和社會安寗，關　是非常重大的。</p>
<p>（二）早期治療，肺病並非不治之症，但不論中外並無特效之藥，歐美人民肺病死亡率的　以逐漸减少，是因為他們有專門治療的改進，所　往往絕能的病人，也能出險　　，保全生命，而這樣適當的治療　早，當　恢復健康的希　也愈大。</p>
<p>在這次防癆運動中，我們懷着兩種熱烈的希望，一是希望從今以後，因各方對於防癆工作的努力，我國肺病，得以逐漸减少，一是希望今後患奢，得以减少悲慘的結果，但是怎樣纔能使我國肺病眞正减少呢？我敢乾脆地說，祗有普及早期診斷，除去了傳染的源泉，才能使肺病减少，怎樣纔能减少患者的悲慘結果呢？我又敢乾脆地說，祗有早期治療，才能拯拔一般患者不致陷人悲慘的命運。一般病家，切勿徬徨歧途，快望着健康之路，邁步前進吧！</p>

<p>— 逸民</p>
<p>一國經濟力量之厚薄，視其國產之發達與否以為斷，我國國產事業之幼稚，與其出品之落後，無容諱言。前淸時代之國貨工業，始終不脫官督商辦之定型，處處束縛限制，無自由發展之餘地。自人民國以來，國貨工業，日見發達，其間雖經種種變亂與挫折，但民族工業之基礎，巳日見穩固。几民生日用之品，向皆仰給於舶來者，現在無一不可自製，且其品質有駕舶來而上之者。「八一三」以還，雖內地交通艱阻，但愛國之士，其所服用之品，必以國貨為富，雖價高倍蓰，亦樂予購用。尤為難得者，為南洋與美洲之銷路大暢。去年一年中，各國貨工廠之出品銷往南洋者，佔十之五六。雖由僑胞愛國之熱忱，亦由出品精良，為各方所樂用。此則許多國貨工業家之心血精神，為不枉費，而民族二業之前途，實大月希望也。本報　會刊行國貨專刊，已有五年之歷史，以筆與讀奢相提倡鼓吹，深受社會人士之歡迎與推許，値此非常時期；實有急行恢復之必要，爰特繼續　行，其內容的　如决：</p>

<h3 id="c103">國貨在南洋 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 菊塵</p>
<p>國貨暢銷南洋</p>
<p>據本月二日哈瓦斯社的消息，謂：日本人辦的南洋拓殖株式會社，在本月份將資本額自二千萬日元增至四千萬日元，以謀擴張南洋商業。我們讀罷這條新聞，覺得此是緣木求魚，原來南洋幾乎可以說華僑最多之處，約有八百餘萬人，而且這許多華僑都是智識水準頗高，民族意識極為濃厚的人，對於祖國抗戰的關懷，並不因遠在國外而稍减，所以抵制日貨運動，極熱烈而普遍，以新加坡而論，密査華僑是否購買日貨約人有二千餘，有犯規者，先之以警吿，繼之以罰捐救國金，如果販賣日貨，往往耳朵被割，其實華僑本皆愛國，又加以這種互相勉勵的辦法，所以日人無論如何增加資本，日貨也無從抬頭，同時華僑愛國心切，所以國貨在南洋特別暢銷</p>
<p>南洋人口土地</p>
<p>馬來半島，荷屬東印度，菲列濱羣島，越南，暹邏，緬甸等，統稱南洋。其地的面積，約計三百八十萬餘平方公里，人口約計一千零五十七萬，出產為咖啡茶，可可，椰于，米等。通商口岸為新加坡，從上海動身，十日可達，來往的各國郵船極多，其商業差不多可以說操在華僑掌握中。</p>
<p>運往南洋手續</p>
<p>去年十一月一個月間，國貨轉運至南洋及巴城蘇門各地銷售者，達五千萬元之譜，打破國貨運銷國外的記錄；足見國貨銷行南洋，並不受抗戰的影響。其銷行南洋的國貨，大概以輕工業製造品及農產品為主，例如棉紗，棉布，綢緞，紙傘，紙烟，肥皂，火柴，火腿，粉絲，味精，藥材，皮革等。在民國　七年九月間，經濟部的國貨證明規則中其一條謂：「凡中華民國人民，自行製造之工業品，品質優良，合於國貨暫訂標準者，得直接呈請經濟部，或由地方主管機關，轉呈經濟部，發給國貨證明書。……」其第七條中謂：「凡領有國貨證明書之工業品，輸出國外時，得請領國貨工業輸出書，但須由原產工廠證明其確為該廠出品。前項輸出證書，以經濟部之商品檢騐局或檢騐分處，為主管簽發機關。未設檢騐局或檢騐分處之地，由海關監督簽發，無監督者，由稅務司代簽。」第八條謂：「凡請領國貨工業品輸出證書者，應先向就近主管機關領取請求單，自行逐項塡明，並呈騐貨物提單，發票及原產工廠出具之證明書，連同證書費，呈候核發。前項之輸出證書，不論工業品為一種或多種，每一分銷地應請領證書張，其證書費每張收國幣二元。」其九條謂：「前條輸出證書之主管簽發機關，對於請求單及附件，如核無虛偽情事，應照所塡請求書，簽發國貨工業品輸出證書。」等等。這是因為抗戰以後，情况兩樣，有些地方，暫為淪沉；有些地方，亦被控制，恐劣貨混充國貨，故曾在前實業部領有國貨證明書者，均須再向經濟部請領國貨證明書，以示鄭重。並且每六個月後，應造報吿表一决，因戰爭時，各地常有變動。不能永久適用。同時於每批貨物運輸時，都應向商會領取國貨證明淸單。吾則，運往南洋，將被目為仇貨，則損失小了。上海市商會暫發國貨證明淸單辦法，其中一條謂：（凡上海市區內國人工廠自行製造之工業品。領有經濟部國貨設明書而欲行銷國外或國內各埠時，得依照本辦法向本會請領國貨證明淸單。上海巿區之範圍，暫以兩特區內之安全區域為限，視實際情形，隨時認定之。第三條謂：凡尙未領有經濟部國貨證明書之工業品，因急於運銷關係，亦得依照本辦法向本會請領國貨證明淸單，但自領有淸單之日起，應於兩個月內依照規定手續，向經濟部請領國貨證明書。其他詳細手續，可向上海市商會面詢。）</p>
<p>國貨商注意點</p>
<p>國貨旣然在南洋暢銷，南洋華僑旣然因愛國而樂用國貨，我們的國貨制造廠農，必常格外奮發自勉，以期不使海外僑胞失望。茲就管見所及，約有下列幾端，應反躬自省：</p>
<p>（一）貨品是否精良？偷工減料的出品易使人起反感。</p>
<p>（二）價目是否克己？利息雖薄，倘能多賣，即多中取利了</p>
<p>（三）交貨是否如的？如遇定貨，不能照期運到，往往使對方發生許多困難，以自失信用</p>
<p>（四）裝置是否精固？裝璜不精緻，則失美觀，不鞏固，則遠涉重洋，易生破碎敗壞之慮</p>

<p>一家長幼的襪子，以現在價格統計起來，這個支出倒也很可觀的，所以精明的人，對於越是小的部份，一些不容放鬆，據鄙人的經騐祇有神魚牌蔴紗襪最為合算的了（上海仁裕　機針織廠出品）雖然我是很粗笨的人，不配稱為精明人，更不像有硏究的專門人，能够分晰質地，闡述理由，不過經騐和事實很明白地吿訴我，同時也有穿過神魚牌蔴紗襪的朋友同樣見地的說過的，神魚牌蔴紗襪最明顯的特點是質地細薄勻凈，穿到脚上，爽朗光滑，看上去和絲襪差不多，處處服貼舒適，經過多决洗晒，顏色仍舊如新，一些不會起毛，比絲襪固然牢，比一般蔴紗襪更牢，諸位一向穿絲襪的，不妨也來試試。蔴紗襪的價目到底比絲襪要便宜的多呢。過去歷史</p>

<p>— 鐘望舒</p>
<p>過去歷史</p>
<p>梅林罐頭食品公司，創辦於民國二十二年，資本五萬元，二十三年增至十萬元，二十六年增至十五萬元，二十七年增至二十萬元，二十八年再增至四十萬元，每年營業總額亦自七萬几遞增至一百餘萬元。</p>
<p>現在狀况</p>
<p>現任董事長為竇耀庭君，經理為屠開泰君，廠長為陳閏歲君，工程師則為歐人依却勒君。其製銷概略，分誌如後：</p>
<p>（一）出品種類分菓醬類，醬油類，發粉類，菜蔬類，魚肉類，鷄鴨類，水菓類，細目繁多，不及備載。</p>
<p>（二）推銷情形戰前之主要市塲，厥為上海與長江流域之南京與漢口，其比數相等，銷於國外者，僅百分之十五，戰後則長江流域巿塲自然喪失，然已立開新途徑以代之，即向南洋羣島推銷與對英美增加輸出是也。戰前對英美輸出，約佔營業總額百分之十，現巳增至百分之二十五，對南洋輸出現亦佔百分之二十五，其所以有此良好成績，原因固多，而梅林出品之精良衛生，要為其主因所在。關於本埠銷路，大部為西菜館與食品商，銷額佔全數之半，近來出品銷售日見暢旺，頗有求過於供之勢。售價方面雖因成本激增，略有上漲，然與舶來品相較，仍廉三倍。</p>
<p>（三）製造手續茲於其主要出品中，擇靑豆一項，言其製造程序：一·採料，靑豆本係西洋種，梅林自法國運至豆種，分散與附近鄉農，而於收穫時向之採購，二·剝壳，運至廠中後用機器將豆壳剝去（附圖下）三·分類，豆有大小，以人工分類，四·淸潔，將豆用水洗滌，五·燒煮，六·淸潔—再度洗滌，七·裝聽（附圖上），以機器裝聽，每聽重量相等，聽內絕無空氣，所以能久貯，八·蒸氣，置於蒸氣鍋中消毒。統計其自原料運至以至裝聽，費時僅一小時半至二小時，不能謂非神速也。</p>

<h3 id="c108">怎樣來利用春假？ <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>本　市各學校，照例自四月一日起又將有七天春假。現在先讓我來談談放春假的意義：天天的爲了書本方面埋頭苦幹，在精神上不免感到疲乏，因此想藉此春風和暖的時候，來調劑調劑我們的身心。這原是一種很好的意義，所以，在每年的春假中總有許多小朋友約集了幾個同學來一次旅行；另有許多小朋友是跟了他們的家長乘了回鄉掃墓的機會，在故鄉逗留幾天。可是我知道小朋友中把這春假任意浪費掉的亦不在少數；換句話說，學校中給了他們七天的假期，他們每天就是躑躅街頭跟着頑皮的小孩胡鬧，甚者，每天涉足在戲院或遊戲場中；這樣的把春假消磨掉，是全失了學校放春假的意義。讀過了本文後，我希望有則改之，無則加勉，尤其在現在這個時候，遠足旅行，或者跟着家長回省都是不可能了；因此，就更容易踏上這條歧途。</p>
<p>遠足旅行等旣然是不可能了，那麼就是說在今年的春假中我們欣賞大自然或者找取一點書本外的常識的機會是沒有了嗎？這種簡潔是完全錯誤的，下面所舉的二種方法，就可以給這個問題一個滿意的答覆</p>
<p>一·你可以上本地公共的圖書館或博物院等；在上課時間，你們沒有暇餘時間詳細　觀，春假中，你們可能了。其他如看報，爲了假期中空的時間較多，那麼我們也可以作仔細的　　。這些不是都能幫助你們獲取書本外的常識嗎。</p>
<p>二·要欣賞大自然，本地的幾個公園如兆豐公園等亦不可以說不夠。同樣的你亦可以如往昔出外遠足旅行般的約幾個同好，帶了皮球，在草地上玩，玩得倦了，就坐在草地上吃點茶點；吃好了，你可以在事前帶了書具，就在當場來一個寫生比賽。這種辦法，各位一定是樂於去實行的。</p>
<p>小朋友們，最後我希望你們在這春假中不要每天都浸在歡天喜地中，每天亦該湊出一定的時間來溫習你們的功課。有天雨的時候，不能外出，不妨喚幾個同學到你家裏來舉行什麽書法競賽，算術遊戲等。</p>
<p>怎樣來利用春假？按了上面種種的辦法，是不會感再到無意義，無興趣了。</p>
<h3 id="c109">放風箏是有益的遊戲 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 郎</p>
<p>「沾　衣欲濕杏花雨，吹面不寒楊柳風」，在這春光明媚，春風駘蕩的季節，正是及時行樂的時候，至於說到行樂，却很複雜，當求其高尚而於身心有益的，祗有放風箏的遊戲諸位小朋友，你們的學校裏，將要放春假了，在這假期里，不妨在溫課之餘，抽出一些時間，來試放風箏，那末比較其他無益的遊戲，要好得多　。</p>
<p>風箏又名紙鳶，它的故事，按獨異志載：「侯　圍臺城，簡文作紙鳶，飛空告急於外」。又訽芻錄載：「五代李鄴，於宮中作紙鳶，引綫乗風為戲，後於鳶首，以竹為笛，使風入竹，聲如箏鳴，故名風箏」。如此我們可以知道，風箏的製造是很早的，不過近來的風箏，都不繫竹為笛，而仍呼風箏為名，它的製法，却有人物魚鳥等多種，乗風而放，栩栩如生，若在夜間放風箏，並可繫上一隻小燈籠，俗稱燈鷂，燈火一點，仿佛和天上的明星爭輝，很為可觀。</p>
<p>風和日麗的天氣，小朋友們約了伴侶，去放風箏，是很快樂的，同時因為要引風箏上升，手裏使不停的收放綫索，兩足更要跑步，手和足旣在運動，全身的各部同時亦在活躍，鍛煉體魄，強健筋骨，使身體上增進健康不少，而且在　形中使小朋友們，引起了髙遠的意志，至上的趨向，寓進取心於遊戲之中，所以這種娛樂，是很可取的，不過，深處孤島的小朋友，要尋覓一所廣場放風箏，很不容易，那末便在學校　或操場上舉行好了。</p>
<h3 id="c110">比重 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>今天又是星期日了。這幾天已有些春意，天也亮得特別的早，時鐘一打了七下，阿慧的家裏每一個人都起了床，可是今天的鐘響了八下，阿慧還躺在床上，在平日他早往學校裏去上課了。他母親已來催促他好幾次，他菜慢吞吞地從床上爬起來，咕噥道：「今天放假，起了身也沒事做，何不多睡一下」。這三句話被阿明聽得了，便在外邊大聲的喊起來：「弟弟！快些來！這裏有件好玩的東西！你快來看呀！」他想這樣或許可以使他弟弟的動作加快些。懶洋洋的阿慧被他哥哥這樣的　喊，便很快的把衣服披在身上，釦子也來不及扣，拖着鞋子，睡眼惺忪的跑出房來，最裏還說着：「在那裏？在那裏？」那知在桌子上，並放着兩隻同樣大小深淺的杯子，杯裏盛滿了水，而在一隻杯中浮着一塊木片。阿慧氣得什麽似的。</p>
<p>「這可算是好玩的嗎！你騙我！」阿慧　　带着忿恨的口氣責備他哥哥。</p>
<p>「你不要生氣，要知在這兩隻杯中有好玩的把戲。我先問你：這兩隻杯子，那一隻來得重？」阿明笑嘻嘻的問他。</p>
<p>阿慧便細細地想：兩隻同樣大小的杯子，而杯裏又盛了同樣的水，而一隻杯裏還浮着一塊木片，他便問口道：「這當然是浮着木片的杯子來得重」。他說完，便轉身去洗臉了。</p>
<p>「你別走，要知道事實上不是你所想像的。那兩隻杯子的重量却是一樣。」阿明明知他弟弟是不會猜對的。</p>
<p>「我不相信」。「好，我可以立即試給你看」。他便去找了一隻籃和一根秤。很仔細的把籃子秤了一下更把杯子放在籃中再秤，一面很小心的不使杯裏的水濺出來。又把盛木片的那一隻子再秤了一下，所得結果却和阿慧所說的不符。阿慧當然是失敗了，可是他雖是猜不中，却要知道爲什麽猜不中的原因？而阿明也很願意的告訴他：</p>
<p>「這兩隻杯子裏本是一樣重，裏面盛滿了水也是同樣的重量，而一隻中浮了一塊木片，根據普通人的眼光中當然是以為有木片的一隻是來得重。要知道在一隻盛滿水的杯中，再把一塊木片放下去，怎樣能容得下？譬如在一隻裝滿了蘋果的籃子，它是滿得不能再滿了，你若再把一隻生梨放下去；等到你手一放，那生梨便落在籃邊，除非你，八蘋果拿去一隻，再放生梨才行。這是同一的道理，當木片放下去時，不得不把水擠出了一些而水的分量比那一隻沒有木片中的水杯量來得少，但是最有趣的，那被擠出的水量和放下木片的重量，却完全相等，因此雖是這兩杯的內容不同，而重量是一樣的。」你那裏知道這被擠出的水量和那木片的重量是相等的呢？阿慧追問他哥哥一句。</p>
<p>「這是根據古代希臘科學家阿基米特所發明的原理其他的科學家並且證明他的原理是確實的。直至現在，依舊是無誤的。那原理是：一切浮游的物體（如木片軟木塞等）因自身的容納在容器（如杯子）中，而排出液體（如水）的重量，却等於這物體自身所有的重量」。說到這裏，被他母親喚阿慧去洗臉的聲音打斷了話匣子。</p>

<p>十四歲小學生　嚴韶華</p>
<p>諸　位囤積米糧煤球等的商人們：</p>
<p>恕我冒昧，突然的寫這樣一封信來，我也沒有別的意思，我所要問的祗是這一句：「你們可有不忍人之心嗎？」請答覆我！</p>
<p>「人皆有不忍人之心」，這句話出于孟子，其時，適為列國互相混戰，屍骸遍野，血流成渠，當然孟子為中國的亞聖，看不過這樣的情形，於是有這樣的話了！</p>
<p>然今日的中國，尤其是上海實不下於當時；雖戰爭西移，而在租界上的難民却增加了多少，街道凍斃的乞丐又不知多少？</p>
<p>這且不要去說他，但最近的米糧，煤球的陡漲，是怎麼一回事？請答覆我！</p>
<p>窮人們的脂膏被收括了，而來充實你們的腰包，這已成了不可磨滅的事實；難道你們的心竟像煤球般的黑麼？</p>
<p>多少人因米…的飛漲而感到困難，甚致於自殺，跳黃浦…</p>
<p>請你們反省一下，假如你們遇到這種情形你將怎樣呢？</p>
<p>旣然孟子說「人皆有不忍人之心」那末請你們把「不忍人之心」拿出來，但不知道你們有不忍人之心嗎？我的話說到這兒也完了，而是我所急切企求的：敬視諸位放出良心來！</p>

<p>那時一道藍色的電光從你東方起來，模樣兒好像一柄刀一般，它在天空中掠過了三次，就暗下去了。太陽正在向西方沒落，像一個血紅的球似的降下地平綫去。</p>
<p>黃金江的洶湧聲，直送到漢　的耳邊，他立在瀑布下瀉的缺口的邊沿上，向下瞧着，水光映着血紅的夕陽，好像火舌一般，在那裏吞吐不已。水聲越鬧越大，竟像雷鳴一樣，直鬧得他頭也昏了。他抖　着，從腰帶上解下了水瓶，向急流中擲去，猛可的覺得一股冷氣，直透過了四肢，他掙扎了一下，就大喊聲，跌下去了。水聲掩住了他的喊聲，水勢洶湧翻騰的，冲過了一塊「黑石」。</p>
<p>可憐小格勒　自守在屋子裏，等候漢士回來，等得非常的心焦。誰知左等也不來，右等也不來，這才使他恐慌起來了。即忙感到牢獄裏去，將一切經過情形告知希華。希華一聽得了這消息，快樂得什麽似的，說漢士此去一定　做了一塊黑石，從此那黃金江中的黃金，就可以歸他一個人　有了。然而小格勒心中總覺得得悲傷得很，整整的哭了一夜。第二天早上他起身之後，見屋子裏旣沒有麵包，又沒有一個錢，於是投到別的金匠那裏　做　計，每天辛辛勤勤的工作，成績又十分良好，所以不久就積得了一筆錢，儘夠繳付希華的罰款了。他於是進牢獄去，把這筆錢完全交給了希華，希華立時恢復了自由，安然的出獄了。希華好生高興，以為黃金江中的黃金，不久定　到手，但是小格勒却苦苦的央求他，設法去找尋漢士，至少要知道他的下落。</p>

<p>罪是什麽？聖經給我們的答覆甚多。最平常的名字，如「迷失的正路；」「違背上帝，」「債」「病」「捆綁」，「任意。」我們並不假設罪的理想是基督徒特有的。基督徒的良心，對於罪固有特別的感覺，但這罪的理想實是最普遍的。我們在史乘上找出來，古時候的埃及，銀都亞非利加，墨西哥，均有許多種類的獻祭；滌罪的儀式，這便是希臘詩人的戲劇，我愛甫斯，阿爾斯，安提剛的小說的一大來源。我們讀蘇格拉底的著作，知道他對於那警戒他行惡提醒他行善的事，也曾表示默認。甫拉圖的「最後審判」一文，也由此產出。羅馬詩人阿勿承認說，「我看見較好的事情，並贊成他們，只是我却傚法那較壞的。」當時哈爾斯，鳩兒納，都認國家的災殃，直接被他們人民的罪惡所造成。違背上帝的他全家受刑罰。如同亞干和他家屬的牛羣羊羣，旣遺殺戮。罪的結果。不但影響犯罪者的家屬，也是能夠影響到他的後世。惡當犯罪，後世的人都因之有罪。以色列和猶太的人民，都因着他們列王的罪瘦了列罰。上帝的律法，因着人奉行表面的儀式，失了多少效力，因為宗敎發生最大的危險。如同法利賽人咬文嚼字，拘泥律法的字句，不遵行律法的精神。希伯來的先知，起來法隊說，「上帝不是歡喜人聽命，甚於歡喜人獻祭麼？」「人阿，上帝已經指示你們為善，他要求於你們的，乃是行公正，愛仁慈，謙恭，與上帝偕行。」罪使上帝的兒子死。這一着我們不可輕看了。我們輕看便是褻瀆上帝的十字架之道，因為世人有相互的關係，沒犯罪的人，不免同着　了罪的受刑罰。「沒有一個人是為自己活，也沒有一個人是為自已死。」世人現多覺醒　　般煩惱的本源，便是罪，而制服這罪惟一的權能，乃是基督耶穌的福音。凡是好人　　　着其罪，並承認之，譬如保羅承認自己為罪首。我們一讀那些忠主人的傳記，就知道我　也莫不抱這同樣的觀念就是覺着自己無論畢生盡力而為，到底在思想，言語，和行為上，仍多有得罪上帝之處。「我們應當做的，我們沒有做。」這是我們常犯的一種罪。我的舒舒服服的過日子，却忘記了許多應盡的本分。我們今日自命為主的忠實門徒，到末日恐怕有許多答不出這些問題的：「你們為要傳福音給外邦人曾犧牲過麼？你們如何設法，營救同居的罪人？」「你們對醉漢，賭客，嫖客，曾立下過什麽榜樣？你們曾常常真正禱告，自省，悔罪么？你們曾撥開幾分之幾的進款為主而用麼？」我們想到這些問題，若是自己真是誠實人，就要承認自己犯了罪，虧缺上帝的榮耀啊。巴不得我們趕早悔改，黑夜一到就遲了。　　欲詳細研究　　　　一二二七</p>

<p>保羅茂尼：「能聽取人家的忠吿；這是我們演員要踏上成功途徑的唯一秘訣。就以我來言，我能成功的大半的原因，是由於我能接受我妻各方的指導之緣故。」</p>

<p>導演的處理手法非常優秀。（一）緊張生動。如潘爾凱萊到漢特從夜總會與詹姆斯賈克奈的格鬥？詹姆斯槍殺亨茀萊鮑嘉等。（二）細膩。介紹詹姆斯賈克奈，亨茀萊鮑嘉，及傑茀萊林的出塲；詹姆期參戰歸來抵鄧尼家；及傑茀萊林與潘麗茜拉蘭的相愛等。（三）都精細可愛。情感的濃厚。詹姆斯拳擊傑茀萊林；詹姆斯破產以後，在酒吧間內；及最後中彈後死於敎堂的石級上等戲都使人感動。（四）過程的簡潔美麗。如酒禁解禁後各個狂歡畫面，及詹姆斯破產時大厦的傾圮，巿民　特寫等。</p>

<p>Hong Kong: It is reported that a serious situation is currently brewing in Macau. The Japanese troops who recently invaded the Zhongshan Peninsula are now deploying troops on the Macau border and have made several "demands" to the Portuguese authorities in Macau, including: (1) The Portuguese withdraw from Ladau and Wanji Islands (transliteration), which were previously disputed between China and Portugal; (2) Recognition of the "government" established by the Japanese in the Zhongshan District; (3) Macau and the surrounding area accept Japanese military currency; (4) The right to search houses for so-called anti-Japanese elements; (5) Closure of the Chinese Customs in Macau. Regarding this information, officials from the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong were unable to confirm it, and the Macau authorities remained silent. However, travelers arriving here from Macau said that there was recently a "sign of Japanese invasion of Macau." Armed Japanese soldiers are often seen gambling at gambling tables and ordering expensive dishes in taverns, gorging themselves but not paying, and the police are helpless.

<h3 id="e9">Extremely Severe Disaster Situation in Hebei Province; Urgent Need for Relief from All Sides; Three Million Disaster Victims in Southern Hebei; Representatives Request Meeting with Relief Committee Authorities in Chongqing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Telegrams from Hebei Province have continuously reported that the disaster situation has reached its most severe stage. Yesterday, this reporter specially visited a certain gentleman, a representative of the disaster victims from Hebei who had just arrived in Chongqing to seek relief, to inquire about the recent situation in the area. According to him, the disaster situation in Hebei is tragic, even worse than recently reported by telegrams. In the southern Hebei area alone, there are three million disaster victims, with property losses estimated at 100 million yuan. Currently, food supplies have been exhausted. Fights often break out in the fields over the digging of bitter herbs, and some people are eating wheat straw mixed with red clay. After eating it, their skin turns yellow, and then their whole body swells up. As for the deaths, those who have died along the way when we came could be seen everywhere, and the abandoned babies on the roadside were hoarse. The tragic scene could not be described in words. Recently, it is the spring famine, and there are no seeds. Spring plowing cannot be carried out, and the future is worrying. After we came to the rear, we learned that the Central Government cares about the people in Hebei who have suffered a disaster, and has allocated 1.5 million yuan in relief funds, to give a little. In addition to urging that it be released as soon as possible, we also appealed to people from all walks of life to expand relief.

<h3 id="e15">No Freedom, No Peace! <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Sounds rumble, light flashes, intermittent. Suddenly bright and dark; when the wind rises, only dots and lines of white plus fire are seen, floating, scattered; in an instant, all things vanish, all sounds are silent. This kind of night scene suddenly appeared on the Huangpu River last night, a flashback, in the eyes and minds of the people of the city, everyone can't help but have different feelings!</p>
<p>Since Japan launched its military aggression in 1931, it has been the tenth year; China has been engaged in all-out resistance since 1937, and it has been the fourth year in thirty-four months; during this period, as far as we can remember, the Japanese have set off fireworks in Shanghai. Last night seemed to be the second time. The first time was at the end of October 1938, when the Japanese army occupied Hankou, so they forgot themselves and celebrated. Originally, the Japanese side fully believed that it would be a quick victory, and that by attacking Nanjing, they would be able to make an alliance under the city; what it encouraged its army and people to do was to take Nanjing as the standard, so it promised a single great wish. Unexpectedly, China held it back. The Japanese side therefore no longer made a second wish, and fully believed that by attacking Hankou, they would be able to control China's lifeblood and coerce China into submission, and they would be able to jump out of the quagmire and end this situation; although they only knew China's determination to resist and realized China's strong resistance afterwards, when they first occupied Hankou, they mistakenly thought they had already won and could return in triumph. The extravagance of breaking the wallet and setting off fireworks at that time, when recalled now, is no different from a spring dream; however, the excitement and joy at that time were far beyond what could be achieved last night.</p>
<p>The fireworks last night probably only made the city people feel a flashback! In Japan, relatively enlightened people have recently been able to openly judge that the inadequacy of the changed government in Nanjing is insufficient to end the so-called "China Incident." The long delay of the Japanese "special envoy" shows that the Japanese authorities have entered a semi-conscious state from a state of infatuation. Yesterday, the Millard Review reported a conversation after an American reporter's short trip to Nanjing; saying that during a banquet, a Japanese officer also thought that "there are still many things going on," revealing a pessimistic and decadent mood; and the Japanese guards encountered on the Shanghai train also said, "This matter is very distant and difficult to achieve results." In short, the Japanese generals, soldiers, and people are now definitely not as happy as when they first occupied Hankou a year and a half ago, due to misjudgment. The Japanese generals, soldiers, and people at least have their remaining consciousness, and still maintain their ability to understand and judge; even if they anesthetize themselves, they are close to being insane, they will not be completely out of control and happily set off any fireworks; the fireworks last night were just a helpless embellishment.</p>
<p>Cursing is useless, ridicule is useless, but these are not curses or ridicules, but honest words. Honestly speaking, Japan's launching of military aggression was a big mistake from the beginning. As their plans ran out and their strength exhausted, they became more and more exhausted and ingenious, so that all their plans were in vain and useless; they wasted their efforts, did hopeless things, and took a dead end; it was both boring and ineffective. Pretending to be excited and setting off fireworks, although it is a trivial matter and has nothing to do with the big picture, it is still watched by everyone, and they can see him slapping himself in the face to pretend to be a fat man. Because now, no one wants to say for sure whether this scene is the result of Jingwei being tricked by the Japanese, or the Japanese being tricked by Jingwei? But everyone is certain that this scene is not conducive to solving the Sino-Japanese problem. The Japanese and Jingwei flaunt peace, but the Japanese hold a bloody knife in their hand, and Wang Jingwei is naked without a knife. Under this situation, the "God of Peace" can only enjoy the fireworks from afar and protect himself wisely, how could he be willing to be taken as a prisoner and be appreciated by them; therefore, everyone is sure that peace is hopeless. The Japanese and Wang flaunt this way, but hope is so hopeless, then what are the fireworks celebrating?</p>
<p>This is not the "God of Peace" deliberately playing tricks, nor is it that the "God of Peace" is cold to the Japanese and Wang; on the contrary, the "God of Peace" must be willing to illuminate both China and Japan equally, and the Chinese people are also willing to welcome the God of Peace. This is what the Japanese deeply know, so they use this to flaunt and appeal. But alas, the Japanese only know one thing, but not the other. You must know that if the Chinese disregard everything and only want peace, then to be honest, they would not have resisted from the beginning. If China's goal of resistance has not been achieved, and they only want peace, then to be honest, they can obtain peace from Japan at any time without waiting for Jingwei to take the stage. Jingwei advocates peace, he thinks that war must end with peace; but he does not know that war is to fight for the purpose of war, not to fight for the purpose of peace; if the purpose of war cannot be achieved one day, then the argument for peace cannot be established one day. He thinks that the Chinese are happy to worship the "God of Peace", he does not know that the "God of Peace" is only a secondary god, he does not know that the main god worshipped by the Chinese is the "God of Freedom." You must know that if the main god has not arrived, how can the auxiliary gods have a seat; you must know that without freedom, there is no peace!</p>

<p>Chongqing: The puppet organization was formally established in Nanjing this morning. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent notes to the envoys of various countries in China, with English translations attached, solemnly declaring China's position. At the same time, it has instructed Chinese envoys stationed abroad to deliver the same notes to the governments of various countries. The original text of the note is as follows: Since Japan's aggression against China, it has not only used various methods to achieve its goal of conquering and controlling Asia and the Pacific. The indiscriminate bombing from the air has caused countless civilian casualties and property destruction. All these and other barbaric acts have strengthened the Chinese people's will to resist violence and to uphold human rights and justice. The Chinese resistance war is approaching three years, and the Japanese warlords have been driven to the brink of desperation and have set up a puppet organization in Nanjing, claiming to be the "National Government of the Republic of China." This organization is purely a puppet manufactured and controlled by the Japanese warlords. Japan obviously intends to use this organization as a tool to seize China's sovereignty, destroy its independence and territorial and administrative integrity, and thereby overturn international laws and order, destroy the Nine-Power Treaty, and eliminate all commercial and interests of third countries in China. The Chinese Government hereby wishes to reaffirm the statements it has repeatedly issued with the utmost solemnity, namely that any illegal organization, such as the one now established in Nanjing, or any other puppet organization existing in other parts of China, is, of course, completely invalid. The Chinese Government and people will absolutely not recognize it. The Chinese Government is deeply convinced that the self-respecting countries of the world will be able to uphold the laws and justice of the international community, and will not grant legal or de facto recognition to any Japanese puppet organization in China. Any act involving any form of recognition is in violation of international law and treaties, and should be regarded as the most unfriendly act towards the Chinese nation, and the recognizer shall be fully responsible for the consequences arising therefrom. The Chinese Government and people, no matter what methods Japan adopts in China, will always resolutely resist Japanese aggression, until the Japanese army is completely driven out of China and justice prevails over might.

<p>Tokyo: The speech by Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, which has aroused commentary in both Britain and the United States, was delivered on Thursday at a luncheon of the Anglo-Japanese Association here. The Ambassador stated that no one can deny that there are various disputes between the two countries, but there is room for resolving such disputes. The goodwill of the two countries, as reflected by the wisdom of their governments, has prevented temporary resentments from turning into deep-seated anger or permanent conflicts. What he felt most was the degree to which the true disputes were shrouded in various misunderstandings and fallacies, all of which were promoted by the unwelcome attention of third parties. The truth will be revealed. The two countries have gradually realized that the other's actions have been discredited and misrepresented in the past few years. He has taken to heart the Japanese government's announced intentions and achieved successes, and has a firm sense of trust in the future of Anglo-Japanese relations. (Reuter's 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The News Chronicle today published an article criticizing Sir Craigie's speech in Tokyo on Thursday, titled "Do Not Collude with Japan," stating that Japan's actions in China are despicable. If we now try to abandon General Chiang Kai-shek and recognize the Wang puppet government in order to buy the aid of the aggressor, then all our claims to resist aggression will become absurd and meaningless. This step will have an astonishing reaction in neutral countries, especially in the United States. The conclusion of the article reads: "If there is collusion with Japan to sacrifice the legitimate government of China, or even if people know that Britain intends to do this, then the domestic unity necessary to win the war will suffer a damaging blow." (Reuter's 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The speech delivered by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, in Tokyo on February 28 has caused a painful impression on the press here. The comments in various newspapers have expressed indignation and sorrow. Several well-known figures have expressed their personal opinions, stating that isolationists in the United States had little trust in Britain, while pro-British elements were trying to dispel this view. Now Craigie's words have made the isolationists even more vocal. Some also predict that the British government is preparing to establish a Far East Munich Agreement. This move will make America's financial assistance to China, the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty, and the implementation of a moral embargo to prevent Japan from infringing on China's sovereignty and interfering in foreign interests in China, all go down the drain. Moreover, comparing Craigie's speech with Chamberlain's condemnation of Japan when the Japanese harassed the British in Tianjin some time ago, they felt that it was incongruous. They also asked: How and when have the actions of the Japanese in China, which have been condemned by more than 50 countries in the world, including Great Britain, been discredited and misrepresented? 30th of March, Reuters.</p>
<h3 id="e20">British Political Circles' Attitude Unchanged <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>London - Although the list of personnel for the "new regime" organized by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing has been circulating here for over a week, this morning's newspapers completely ignored its establishment. Various circles related to the Far East expressed the opinion that the list includes Wang's old confidants and former members of the Anfu clique, which is not noteworthy, and the rest are all mediocre people. British political circles emphatically stated that the British government's attitude remains as it has always announced in Parliament, that is, Britain adheres to the Nine-Power Treaty, recognizes the legitimate government of China, and will not recognize any other regime. It is rumored that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, will meet with President Roosevelt and U.S. Secretary of State Hull during his upcoming vacation to the United States to discuss the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the two "new regimes." However, this has been firmly denied by political circles here. It is said that Sir Robert Craigie's trip to the United States is purely of a private nature, as he has been working hard and needs a rest. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>The flag of the Nanjing "new government" was raised this morning amidst gun salutes and military music. After the completion of the establishment ceremony, the "government officials" took a group photo. Before leaving, Wang gave a speech to the reporters. Today, the streets of Nanjing once again saw the Blue Sky White Sun flag, which is the first time since December 1937. It was seen hanging in every street and shop, but what was strange was that a small yellow flag was not seen hanging in many places to distinguish it from the flag of Chongqing. The establishment ceremony was quite simple and was completed in twenty minutes. On the central podium of the meeting place was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and two Kuomintang flags were hung. The public was strictly prohibited from entering the meeting place, and Chinese soldiers closely guarded all entrances and exits. Chinese sentries with Mauser pistols were also stationed in the garden and inside the building. In addition to the "government officials," those who attended the ceremony included army officers, reporters, and photographers. After the music was played, the officials bowed three times to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and Wang read his declaration. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

After the ceremony, Kuomintang flags were hung on all public buildings. The public is extremely indifferent to this, and most people seem unaware of the change of regime. Foreign officials are awaiting government instructions on what attitude to take towards the "new regime." Some expect that they may have dealings with the "Political Affairs Commission" in practice.

<h3 id="e26">Soviet Foreign Minister Declares Continued Implementation of Peaceful Policies Preventing the Spread of the Current European War Warns Near Eastern Countries Not to Be Exploited Territorial Dispute Between Soviet Union and Romania Awaits Resolution <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union reconvened today. Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov immediately attended and delivered a speech, reaffirming the Soviet Union's neutral stance towards the current European war and clarifying the Soviet Union's advocacy of peaceful policy. He strongly stated that the Soviet Union has no disputes with the Scandinavian countries, Turkey, or Iran. Only the Bessarabia issue with Romania remains unresolved. However, the speech rarely touched upon Germany. The main points of the original speech are as follows: Molotov first stated, "There is still an outstanding issue between our country and Romania, namely, Romania's annexation of the Bessarabia province, which our country has never recognized." As for our country's relations with Germany, they have greatly improved compared to last year, which is completely different from the development of our country's relations with Britain and France. This is because Britain and France wanted to use "the Soviet Union as their tool" in their war against Germany, which we have rejected. In short, it can be asserted that our country's neutral policy is not in line with the tastes of the French authorities. Last year, when our country held negotiations with Finland, the Finnish-Soviet war on November 30 would not have broken out if there had been no third-party interference. The reason why our country firmly wanted to control the Karelian Isthmus was because Finland's bases there were right under the elbow of our city of Leningrad, and it would not be difficult for a third country to use these bases to plot against the Soviet Union. As for the Finnish People's Government organized by Kuusinen, it has been automatically dissolved in order to facilitate the reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Finland. Our country could have easily occupied the entire Finland, but we still signed a peace treaty with it, which is a clear proof of our country's magnanimity. To this day, Finland's domestic and foreign independent sovereignty have been guaranteed, and it is not necessary to conclude an alliance treaty with Sweden and Norway. Moreover, according to Article 3 of the peace treaty, neither of the signatory countries shall join any groups that are detrimental to the other party. Finland's alliance with the two Nordic countries violates this provision. In addition, there are currently suspicious military movements in the Syrian Republic and other parts of the Near East, and we must closely monitor them to understand the intentions of these troop movements. It is hoped that the Western European countries will not play with fire, because if we find that these troop movements are detrimental to our country, we will immediately take retaliatory measures. Don't say we didn't warn you. Furthermore, there are no disputes between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Iran, and the Scandinavian countries, and we are willing to maintain friendly relations with Turkey and Iran. In a word, the Soviet Union is willing to guarantee international peace on the one hand and safeguard its own security on the other. We must strictly adhere to neutrality and avoid getting involved in the war vortex. Our current policy is to prevent the war from expanding, and we will continue to implement this policy in the future while strengthening our country's military power and national power in general." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov delivered a speech at the sixth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Molotov's Speech in Full</p>
<p>"Comrade Delegates, it has been five months since the last session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. During this short period, major international events have occurred, so we must review our foreign policy issues at this session of the Supreme Soviet.  To review the recent international situation, we must pay attention to the war that broke out in Central Europe last autumn. Since the outbreak of the war, the conflict between the British-French group and Germany  has not developed into a major war, with only occasional contact on the sea and in the air. However, the peace intentions expressed by Germany last year have been rejected by the British and French governments, which is a well-known fact. Therefore, both sides are working hard to prepare for an expansion of the war. Germany has strengthened its military power since occupying neighboring countries and uniting 80 million Germans, and has become a strong enemy of the major European imperialist powers of Britain and France. Therefore, Britain and France declared war on Germany, using the fulfillment of their obligations to Poland as an excuse. It is now clear how much the true purpose of the British and French governments in waging war against Germany differs from the goals of guaranteeing Poland and Czechoslovakia. In fact, the British and French governments have declared that their war aim is to crush Germany, although they still use slogans such as defending "democratic" countries and safeguarding the rights of "small countries" to conceal their true purpose. At the same time, due to the Soviet Union's rejection of Britain and France's anti-German policy, their hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union has become more obvious, fully proving the imperialist policy of hostility towards socialist countries.</p>
<p>When the Finnish war began, British and French imperialism prepared to use this as a starting point for war against the Soviet Union, while still using Sweden and Norway to participate in this war. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the expanding European war has long been clear to all parties. The Soviet Union's peaceful policy has been fully demonstrated in this European war. At the beginning of the European war, the Soviet Union announced its neutral policy and stated that it would always pursue this policy in this war.</p>
<p>Improved Soviet-German Relations, Obvious British-French Hostility</p>
<p>The improvement of Soviet-German relations was evidenced by the non-aggression pact signed last August. This new and good relationship has been further strengthened in the former Polish incident, and its greatness has also been proven. The development of Soviet-German economic relations has been proven by the trade agreements signed in August 1939 and February 1940. Currently, trade between the Soviet Union and Germany  has increased, and there is great potential for further development in the future. On the other hand, our relationship with Britain and France is the opposite of the above situation. Because the Soviet Union was unwilling to be used by British and French imperialism as a tool for them to wage war against Germany and gain world hegemony, we have aroused their hostility towards our country. This hostile attitude has been most exposed in the Finnish war. Regarding the Finnish issue, I will explain it separately. In the past few months, British and French anti-Soviet policies have been proven by other facts. Two months ago, the French authorities ordered the police to search our country's commercial representative office in Paris. Although the French police conducted a very thorough search, they still found nothing. As a result, it only made the initiators lose face and proved that this hostile attitude towards our country was completely unreasonable. Regarding the recall of our country's ambassador to France, Suritz, the French government attempted to find various fabricated excuses to show hostility to the Soviet Union. In order to show that it no longer valued relations with France, our country has already recalled Suritz.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the issue of British warships detaining two of our country's merchant ships bound for Vladivostok in the Far East (the ships were carrying goods purchased from China and the United States), as well as the British side's refusal to deliver orders, etc., all these facts are clear evidence of British and French hostility towards the Soviet Union. Although Britain and France have attempted to rationalize their hostile policies, they have accused us of conducting trade with Germany, which is tantamount to helping Germany wage war against them. This kind of argument is not worth laughing at. We will now try to make a comparison between German-Soviet and German-Romanian relations. Miscellaneous trade with Germany accounts for half of its national foreign trade. Romania exports several times more goods to Germany than the Soviet Union (according to the ratio of national output of the Soviet-Romanian countries). However, Britain and France are not hostile to Romania, nor have they asked Romania to stop trading with Germany. Britain and France have a different attitude towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, the reason why Britain and France are hostile to the Soviet Union is definitely not because we are trading with Germany. The crux of the matter is that we are not being used by the British and French ruling class to wage war against Germany. In retaliation, Britain and France have adopted a hostile attitude towards us. We have absolutely no unfriendly behavior towards Britain and France, but they have taken various hostile actions.</p>
<p>As for the absurd rumors spread by Britain and France about the Red Army "invading India" and "invading the East," no one will believe them. If anyone actually believes these rumors, then that person must have lost his mind. The Soviet Union's neutral policy is absolutely not welcomed by the British and French ruling class, this point is extremely obvious. Their nerves are no longer very normal. They are trying to force us to adopt hostile and war-like behavior towards Germany, using us to achieve their imperialist goals. British and French gentlemen must know that the Soviet Union has never been and will never be used by others. The Soviet Union has always pursued its own policies, and these policies will never change, regardless of whether gentlemen from other countries agree or not.</p>
<p>Meaning of War against Finland: Guaranteeing National Security</p>
<p>I will now mention the Finnish issue. What is the true meaning of the three-month war in Finland? This war was due to our urgent need to defend our northwest border (especially Leningrad). You have long understood this. In October and November of last year, the Soviet government repeatedly decided to discuss with the Finnish government ways to ensure the security of our country (especially Leningrad). In view of the worsening international situation, we believe that this kind of discussion is extremely necessary and urgent. Due to the Finnish government's unfriendly attitude, the talks yielded no results, so the Soviet-Finnish war  was unavoidable. We dare say that if Finland had not been controlled by foreign forces and had not adopted a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union and Finland would have been able to resolve the dispute peacefully. The Soviet government made a request at the time, but it still failed to resolve the dispute through diplomatic means. Now that the Finnish war has ended and the Soviet Union and Finland have signed a peace treaty, we should use undeniable facts to point out the importance of the Finnish war. These facts are that the Finnish authorities have built solid fortresses near Leningrad and the entire Karelian Isthmus, containing cannons and machine guns. There are no fewer than thousands of these fortresses, with tunnels connecting them to the rear, and trenches and various obstacles to trap tanks, such as landmines, etc. around them. In addition, there is the Mannerheim Line, built by foreign experts, with a style and structure similar to the Maginot and Siegfried Lines. The Finnish authorities believe that no army can break through this line, and at the same time, they have turned every town in the area into a solid position. Also, in eastern and southern Finland, the Finnish authorities have built railways and highways directly to our border (this highway has no economic importance).</p>
<p>In short, in 1939, Finland (especially the Karelian Isthmus) had been turned into a military stronghold, so that a third powerful country could use it to attack Leningrad and the Soviet Union. From this point of view, Finland's hostility towards us last autumn was by no means accidental. In fact, troops hostile to the Soviet Union had built a solid position in Finland, and as soon as the situation became unfavorable to the Soviet Union, they began to act. The Soviet Red Army has shattered the Mannerheim Line and won supreme glory, because only the Red Army can achieve this in difficult circumstances. At the same time, the Red Army has also destroyed the military base for attacking Leningrad. Not only that, but the Red Army has also defeated several anti-  plans that third countries have carried out over the past few years.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Soviet Army's War against Finland Was Actually a War against Britain and France <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>"The hatred of the Finnish government and military authorities towards our country can also be seen from the atrocities of the Finnish White Guards against the wounded Red Army soldiers. For example, the Finnish White Guards surrounded the air-raid shelter of our wounded soldiers' hospital north of Lake Ladoga. One hundred and twenty seriously wounded soldiers were killed in the shelter. Some were burned to death, some had their skulls smashed, and others  were stabbed to death or shot to death. In addition to the seriously wounded, many of the soldiers who died in the area and elsewhere had their heads struck, or suffered fatal wounds from bayonets. The faces of some of the soldiers who were killed were covered in knife wounds. Some of the corpses had their heads severed, and the heads were missing. As for the ambulance team members captured by the Finnish White Guards, they also encountered unbelievably cruel acts. Some of the corpses were tied to trees, and their heads were cut off. These barbaric and cruel acts were the result of the Finnish White Guards' attempt to incite the public to hate our country. This is the true face of Finland's supporters of "Western civilization." It is not difficult to understand that the Finnish war was not only a war against the Finnish army. The truth is actually more complicated than this. What our army encountered was not only the Finnish army, but also the joint military power of Britain, France, and other imperialists. They supplied Finnish small capitalists with various weapons, aircraft, cannons, disguised "volunteers," money, and various military supplies, and promoted hot propaganda to the whole world, with the aim of trying to arouse an anti-Soviet war by various means. In this roar of the enemies of the Soviet Union, the loudest were the howls of the prostitutes of the Second International, the "socialists," and the cries of Attlee and Blum, the slaves of the capitalists.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Britain and France Are Undeniably Responsible for Inciting War in Eastern Europe <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>When British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons on March 19, he not only expressed malicious regret for failing to eliminate the Finnish war, using it to show the  "peace-loving" imperialist heart to the world, but also explained how to incite Finland to wage war against the Soviet Union. He published the following figures for the number of military supplies that Britain had granted and actually transported to Finland. Britain granted permission to transport 152 aircraft to Finland, and 101 aircraft had actually been transported to Finland. Also, for cannons, Britain granted permission for  3  3, but the actual number transported to Finland was 114. Britain granted permission for 297,000 shells, but only 185,000 were transported to Finland. 100 Vickers guns were transported to Finland. In addition, 15,700 aircraft bombs were transported to Finland (Britain had originally granted permission to transport 22,700 to Finland). In addition, 10,000 anti-tank landmines transported from Britain to Finland, which was half of what Britain had originally granted permission for. Chamberlain continued with a shameless attitude, "Britain's preparations for this expedition were extremely rapid. In early March, an expeditionary force of 100,000 men was ready to go to Finland (two months earlier than Mannerheim had requested), and more troops will be sent to Finland later. This kind of candid admission is the true face of the peace-loving British imperialism.</p>
<p>As for France, we have learned from the French newspapers that the French side has transported 179 aircraft, 472 cannons, 795,000 shells, 5,100 machine guns, and 200,000 hand grenades to Finland. On March 11, former French Prime Minister Daladier declared in the parliament, "Among the countries providing military aid to Finland, France ranks first. At the same time, in order to accept the requirements of the Finnish capital, France has transported the latest bomber to Finland." Daladier continued, "Since  January 26, the French army has been ready to depart to Finland." Several French ships were preparing to depart to transport troops to Finland. Daladier also said, "The Allies are determined to do their best to help Finland." Daladier's speech has lost its sober rationality, so there is no need to discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to discuss Sweden's position in the Finnish war. According to the Swedish newspaper, the aircraft supplied by Sweden to Finland accounted for one-fifth of Sweden's own air force. According to the Swedish Minister of the Army, "Finland has obtained 84,000 rifles, 575 machine guns, 300 cannons, 30,000 hand grenades, and 50 million bullets from Sweden. These military supplies are all the latest weapons of war."</p>
<p>Italy was also quite active in inciting Finland to wage war. The Italian side helped Finland with 50 military aircraft. At the same time, the "peace" faction in the United States also provided assistance to the Finnish side.</p>
<h3 id="e29">The Heavy Losses Suffered by Both Finland and the Soviet Union in the War <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>According to our incomplete statistics, other countries shipped the following military equipment to Finland during the war: 550 airplanes, 1,500 artillery pieces, 6,000 machine guns, 100,000 rifles, 650,000 hand grenades, 2.5 million artillery shells, and 160 million bullets. From this, we can prove that the Finnish war was by no means a local conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland, but in fact, a war between the Soviet Union and a coalition of countries hostile to the Soviet Union. The Red Army has now destroyed this coalition, adding a glorious page to the history of warfare. At the same time, the heroic spirit of sacrifice of our people has been fully demonstrated. The Finnish war has caused heavy losses to both our side and the Finnish side. According to statistics from our General Staff, the total number of soldiers killed in action and died from injuries is 48,745 (approximately less than 49,000), and the number of wounded is 158,863. Finland is trying to reduce the total number of casualties, but their losses are indeed heavier than ours. According to statistics from our General Staff, the number of Finnish soldiers killed is over 60,000 (not including those who died from injuries), and the number of wounded is 250,000. The total number of Finnish soldiers is about 600,000. In other words, half of the Finnish army has been killed or wounded. All of these are facts. (To be continued) (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>The British government in London had not decided last night on a response to the Soviet Union's proposal to begin negotiations on a British-Soviet commercial agreement.

<p>After the German army occupied Warsaw, several important archives from the former Polish Foreign Ministry fell into the hands of the German army. After a detailed review by the German Foreign Ministry, those with historical value are being announced one by one. The first announcement was made yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>First document</p>
<p>The original text of a telegram from American Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Grew, to the British Foreign Office on April 2, 1935, is as follows: "In accordance with Foreign Secretary Eden's instructions, I paid a visit to Polish President Piłsudski this afternoon. The conversation did not go very smoothly, as most of Piłsudski's remarks gave me and the two Polish cabinet members who participated in the conversation a sense of inscrutability. The topic was Poland's treaties with Germany and Soviet Russia, emphasizing that Soviet policy was unpredictable, and several countries could not avoid misunderstanding it, especially Lloyd George. Lloyd George's support for Russian leader Denikin was clear evidence of a misjudgment of the situation. Piłsudski expressed the hope that Britain would pay attention to its own colonies and not repeat Lloyd George's mistakes by meddling in other people's affairs. Piłsudski also inquired about the current situation in Jamaica. I replied that if Europe's importance was only equal to that of Jamaica, we would have nothing to worry about. I further stated that we were originally unwilling to meddle in European continental affairs, but any event on the European continent was directly related to Britain. Piłsudski objected to this. In short, the impression I got of Piłsudski was that since he concluded treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union, he had decided to stick to his principles and was unwilling to change his attitude."</p>
<p>Second document</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the second document with significant historical value copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report from Polish Ambassador to the United States, Potocki, to the Polish Foreign Minister from Washington on November 21, 1938. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"On November 19, I (Potocki referring to himself) held a long conversation with Mr. Bullitt, the American Ambassador to France, who is currently on vacation in his home country, mentioning that he had an unusually cordial relationship with Polish Ambassador to France Łukasiewicz. (Note: Bullitt regularly reports on the European situation to President Roosevelt, and is deeply trusted and valued by Roosevelt and the State Department.) All of Bullitt's observations are from the perspective of a journalist, not from the standpoint of a politician, and he considers the situation to be extremely pessimistic. During the conversation with me, he declared that there would be amazing changes in the spring of 1939, and Europe would be threatened by war. He also believed that the center of gravity in Europe had shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe since the Munich Conference, where Britain and France succumbed. Bullitt discussed the situation in Britain and France, emphasizing that Britain was not prepared for war, and at the same time, it was very difficult for British industry to reorganize to adapt to wartime mass production, especially the problem of aircraft manufacturing was the most difficult to solve. Bullitt believed that the French army was still good, but the air force was also lagging behind. When the European crisis occurred in the autumn of 1938, military experts told Bullitt that the European war would last at least six years, and as a result, Europe would be completely destroyed, and all countries would become communist, with the Soviet Union reaping the benefits. Regarding the Soviet Union, Bullitt believed that since the purge of the Red Army, especially since the departure of General Galen, the Soviet army had greatly deteriorated and could no longer engage in any war activities. Today's Soviet Union is almost the "sick man of Europe." Bullitt was extremely angry with Hitler, emphasizing that only war could stop the development of German aggression. When I asked him how he predicted the future war situation, Bullitt declared that he believed that Britain, France, and the United States would greatly expand their military forces to resist Germany, and only then could there be a final decision. I then asked how the European war would break out, because I believed that Germany would not necessarily attack Britain and France. Bullitt replied that Britain, France, and the United States still needed at least two years to complete the expansion of their military forces. At the same time, Germany might advance eastward. In fact, what Britain and France most hoped for was a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union, especially hoping that the Soviet Union would reveal its never-announced strength, causing Germany to exhaust its power until it could not withstand a single blow from Britain and France. I asked whether the United States would participate in this war. Bullitt replied, "There is no doubt about it, but the United States' participation must be after Britain and France have taken the first step." Today's situation in the United States, with its hatred of German Nazism and Hitlerism, is no less deep than when the United States declared war in 1917. At this point, Bullitt asked me about Poland's attitude. I replied that Poland was determined to defend its territory, and if Germany crossed the border to attack, Poland would fight back with all its strength. Finally, Bullitt discussed Germany's ambitions for Ukraine, saying that it was very dangerous for Poland. Bullitt's understanding of the "Eastern European issue" in the conversation seemed to be somewhat superficial. Signed, Potocki.</p>
<p>Third document</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the third document with significant historical value copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report submitted by Polish Ambassador to the United States, Potocki, to the Polish Foreign Minister on January 12, 1939, discussing the general situation of anti-German sentiment and the Jewish question in the United States at that time. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"What is prevalent in the United States is the sentiment of hatred for fascism, especially for Hitler and things related to National Socialism. The propaganda machine is almost entirely in the hands of the Jews. Radio, film, daily newspapers, and publications are controlled by them, accounting for almost 100%. Although they have tried their best to describe the dark situation in Germany, such as religious persecution and the situation in concentration camps, the American people are still isolated from the European situation, so it has not been effective. Currently, the American people have regarded Hitler and National Socialism as the most vicious threat in the world. However, this well-planned anti-National Socialist movement does not involve the Soviet Union. In addition, the United States is also creating a war mentality, making the American people believe that European peace is on the verge of danger, war is inevitable, and that if a world war breaks out, the United States must participate in the war to protect the freedom and democracy of the world. President Roosevelt is the first person to express hatred for fascism, and his role is twofold: (1) President Roosevelt, in view of the complexity and difficulty of domestic problems, especially labor disputes, advocates the theory of anti-fascism, shifting the public's attention away from domestic problems; (2) The United States' creation of a war mentality and the claim of a crisis of European peace are intended to make the public accept a huge military build-up plan that exceeds the United States' defense needs. The anti-National Socialist sentiment in the United States is even more intensified by Germany's harsh treatment of Jews and the resettlement issue. Jewish intellectuals such as New York Governor Baruch, newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and other Jewish friends of President Roosevelt are all participating in the movement. They all want to support Roosevelt as the guarantor of human rights, religion, and freedom of speech. These Jews in high positions in the American government, although posing as "protectors of democracy," are actually inseparably linked to the Jewish International. According to the Jewish International, it is also acting cunningly to benefit its race by supporting Roosevelt as the "guarantor of human rights." In short, it is a very skillful maneuver to hide the difficulties of American domestic politics and shift the American people's anti-Jewish attention to anti-fascism." Signed, Polish Ambassador to the United States, Potocki.</p>
<p>Fourth document</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the fourth document with significant value copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report from Polish Ambassador to Paris, Łukasiewicz, to the Polish Foreign Minister from Paris on February 1, 1939. The original text is as follows: "The French Parliament's discussion on France's current foreign policy ended yesterday. As a result, the Daladier government's confidence was voted on with 379 votes to 234 votes. In the current situation, I must make some suggestions regarding Franco-Polish relations and the Franco-Polish pact. I (Łukasiewicz referring to himself) recall that in my report on December 17, 1938, I mentioned that since the September incident, that is, the signing of the Franco-German non-aggression declaration, French political figures have become more critical of Franco-Polish relations. Since then, French newspapers have also carried more articles on the Franco-Polish question. Both French leftists and rightists have commented on it. The former French hostility towards Poland has been eliminated since the September incident, and more rational arguments have also appeared at present. At this time, France's international position is deteriorating, especially since Your Excellency (referring to the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to Hitler in Berchtesgaden after the Munich Agreement), the press and political figures here have commented on Foreign Minister Bonnet's diplomatic policy towards Poland. Newspapers have accused Foreign Minister Bonnet of failing to use the opportunity during Your Excellency's visit to southern France to forge closer political relations between France and Poland. Since Your Excellency left Berchtesgaden, the newspapers here have directly attacked Foreign Minister Bonnet for improper measures. Since then, in order to avoid being attacked, Foreign Minister Bonnet has praised the difficult situation in Poland and the threat Poland will face from the Germans. However, the French not only understand that German-Polish relations have not deteriorated, but also that Poland is not threatened by Hitler's actions in Ukraine. At the same time, the anti-French movement is prevalent in Italy, making France's hope of Italy joining the so-called "Imperial Policy" a pipe dream. Under this atmosphere, Foreign Minister Bonnet's report in the Chamber of Deputies caused great dissatisfaction among the members, who considered it too bland and uninteresting. Fortunately, the French speaker's words were able to arouse the members' patriotism and allow the vote of confidence to pass with 379 votes to 234 votes." Signed, Polish Ambassador to France, Łukasiewicz.</p>
<p>Fifth document</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry in Berlin has recently published the fifth important document copied from the Polish Foreign Ministry, which is a report from Polish Foreign Ministry official Graczynski to the Polish Foreign Minister on November 2, 1938. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>"Your Excellency, Minister, I held a conversation with the Czech presidential candidate, Mr. Landa, the former General Manager of the Třinec Iron and Steel Works. Mr. Landa described Czech policy as follows: 'For a thousand years, the Czechs have had close political relations with Germany. It was not until after independence in 1919 that there was an independent Czech policy, but I believe that the Czech Republic must return to its original state, that is, become Germany's political satellite.' Mr. Landa is a famous Czech industrialist, and his remarks are worth paying attention to. I am sending this special telegram for your perusal." Respectfully, Graczynski.

<p>Washington D.C. – U.S. Secretary of State Hull, U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt, and Polish Ambassador to the United States Potocki issued statements today denouncing as false the German publication of a "White Paper" claiming to know President Roosevelt's attitudes on isolationism and aid to Britain and France. Hull also stated that the United States does not believe that Germany possesses such documents. (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to information received indirectly from Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Hull denied the information about the American ambassador participating in the conversation contained in the Polish Foreign Ministry archives. However, sources here claim that American diplomats have been spreading information about Germany's aggressive intentions and encouraging Polish nationalism, hindering the peaceful resolution of European problems.

<h3 id="e33">British and French Views on Soviet Foreign Minister's Speech <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London – Newspapers here are giving prominent coverage to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech, considering it to be a mockery of Hitler and an expression of the Soviet Union's willingness to improve relations with countries other than Germany. The "Daily Herald's" diplomatic correspondent said that this speech is nothing less than a real setback for Germany, and its significance is that the Soviet Union has resumed an independent attitude. Soviet sources in London all hinted that Moscow is not opposed to reopening British and American commercial negotiations. All of the above shows that the Soviet Union is rapidly determining that the Allies will win. If the Soviet Union effectively stops its economic aid to Germany, then the relations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in all aspects will definitely be genuinely improved. The "Daily Telegraph" editorial said that the tickets taken out of the fire by Hitler for Stalin will still be accepted as before, but there is nothing to reciprocate. The "Daily Mail" said that Molotov's speech has ended Hitler's fantasy of a tripartite alliance.</p>
<p>Paris – Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's speech yesterday has been commented on by political figures here, who said that its main points are two: (1) Finland should continue to be politically neutralized; (2) Romania occupies the province of Bessarabia (which belonged to Russia before the outbreak of the European War), and the Soviet Union has never recognized it, so it is inconvenient to sign a non-aggression treaty with Romania. It seems that the Soviet Union's future policy will be based on these two points. Regarding the second point, Romania's position is very clear, because the Soviet Union signed a multilateral convention with Romania and other countries in 1933, defining an aggressor, and has actually accepted the obligation to respect Romania's current borders. The governments of Britain and France are still taking a calm attitude towards the development of Soviet policy, because the Soviet Union's proximity to Germany must be expressed in practical actions that are beneficial to Germany before it can cause anxiety in Britain and France. At this moment, it is not yet known what the Soviet Union will do economically and politically, so Britain and France are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and when necessary, they will naturally respond accordingly.

<p>Paris – The French newspaper "L'Intransigeant" quoted a dispatch from London as saying that the Allied Supreme Military Conference made a final decision yesterday to intensify the Allied blockade of Germany. What had been resolved before was only on the ocean side, but now the issue is being discussed from a land perspective. All commercial routes connecting with Germany will now be completely blocked. This new plan will be implemented soon. The economic war has now begun. Germany is abusing the neutrality of other countries, and Britain and France cannot continue to ignore this. The methods that the Allies will adopt may cause some inconvenience to some countries and put others at some risk. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Paris – Political figures here recently said that the declaration issued yesterday by the joint meeting of the British and French Defense Supreme Committee has made a deep impression on European countries, and the Nordic countries have also adopted a more realistic view. Taking Norway as an example, the German submarine U-21 entered Norwegian territorial waters in the North Sea and attacked a British ship, and has been detained by the Norwegian authorities. This shows that the country can take strong action to safeguard its rights. As for Germany's plan to win over the Soviet Union and Italy to sign a tripartite agreement, it has obviously failed. It is now trying to win over Italy, Hungary, and Yugoslavia in order to establish a quadrilateral agreement. Among them, Hungary may join under pressure from Germany, but Yugoslavia will definitely not comply. Judging from the tone of the country's newspapers, it does not express trust in Germany and Italy, which can be known. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>London – According to a special dispatch from here today, Swiss newspapers' Rome correspondents report that they do not believe that Italy is likely to join the Berlin-Moscow axis. A Swiss newspaper's Rome dispatch summarizes Italy's attitude towards the Soviet Union as follows: (1) Italy believes that the Soviet Union has little value as a military ally; (2) Rome has not changed its suspicion of Moscow's political and world goals; (3) Although this will not prevent Italy from continuing its trade with the Soviet Union, it is out of the question for Italy to conclude any political or military system in which communism participates. A Swiss newspaper's correspondent in Romania reports that the Romanian events clearly demonstrate the danger of "offering gifts to seek security," and that U.S. President Roosevelt has announced that this move is inconsistent with genuine peace. Romania, like other countries in the Balkan Peninsula, only hopes not to be subjected to terror and aggression, and is prepared to pay a high price to achieve this wish, but its price is also limited.

It usually advocates for higher wages and improved workers' lives. It was originally based on the instructions of the dissolved left-wing Japan Labor-Farmer Party and engaged in various activities. However, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities relentlessly suppressed left-wing groups. In the winter of 1937, Hashimoto, the chairman of the union's executive committee, and Kato, the leader of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, were successively arrested. The union suffered a blow from this, but still did not participate in the National Service Association promoted by the government. Later, left-wing groups were dissolved one after another. The only surviving one was this union. At this point, the leaders of the union decided to dissolve on their own after a meeting and transform the 1,000 members into the National Service Promotion Association. According to a statement released to reporters by the chairman of the union, "The era of the labor movement has passed. We are forced to participate in the National Service Movement."

<p>Tokyo – Since the yen's exchange rate was decided to break away from the pound sterling and link with the U.S. dollar in October last year, Japanese business circles, due to the daily decline in the pound sterling's exchange rate and the major blow that Japanese export trade will suffer, with cotton textiles almost no longer able to be exported to countries in the pound sterling group, are all advocating that the yen should restore its link with the pound sterling. The Cotton Yarn Association and cotton cloth exporters have scheduled a meeting for April 1 to discuss this matter. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo reports that food shortages in Japan are extremely serious. Recently, the bizarre idea of ordering people to skip lunch has been proposed. Workers in major spinning mills have suffered a sharp decline in work efficiency due to insufficient nutrition and frequently damage machines. Anti-war sentiment is extremely strong.

<h3 id="e43">Soviet Union Develops Oil Fields in North Sakhalin <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo's Hochi Shimbun reports that the Soviet Union relies heavily on oil fields along the Black Sea coast for its kerosene needs. The Soviet government, fearing disruptions in the supply from these oil fields, is actively developing oil fields in North Sakhalin to achieve an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons. Construction of kerosene pipelines has already commenced on the northwest coast of Sakhalin. Simultaneously, the Soviet government is purchasing large quantities of kerosene from the United States. According to Japanese ship crew members returning from Vladivostok, they witnessed numerous Soviet and American oil tankers docked at the port. It is estimated that since September of last year, the US has shipped as many as 2.14 million barrels of kerosene to the port. The reasons for this are threefold: (1) The Soviet Union may be selling most of its domestic oil production to Germany, necessitating the replenishment of its reserves. (2) The situation in the Black Sea region is unstable, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. (3) The United States might also impose a ban on kerosene shipments to the Soviet Union, making it necessary to prepare in advance. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Both Concessions Under Strict Guard Yesterday; Situation Unusually Tense; Unnecessary Roads and Bridges Blocked; Heavy Police and Detective Presence; Fortunately, No Incidents <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>With the "New Regime" commencing in Nanjing yesterday, both concessions implemented special security measures for the day, blocking unnecessary roads and bridges, and shortening tram routes. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e46">Number of Forced Marchers Small <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war with China, Japan's domestic manpower, material resources, and financial resources have long been in a state of exhaustion. The people's war-weariness grows by the day. To address this, the Japanese military single-handedly orchestrated the "New Regime" to promote the narrative of peace. Yesterday marked the start date of the "New Regime" in Nanjing, and various organizations in the city, large and small, separately held "celebratory" parades and demonstrations in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, Huxi, and downtown areas, rallying coolies, children, women, and the elderly. However, most refused to participate, so each district's marchers numbered only a few dozen.</p>
<p>Concession Security; Troops Deployed</p>
<p>The police authorities of both concessions, fearing that anti-Japanese elements would enter the concessions to disrupt order or engage in other activities, decided after a meeting the previous night to implement special security measures for the day. In addition to mobilizing all police officers and detectives, they also deployed the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the Shanghai-based troops of various countries. British troops were responsible for maintaining order in the area east of Yuqiaqing Road, west of the Bund, north of Edward VII Avenue, south of the Suzhou Creek, and along the northern embankment area. American troops were responsible for the area west of Yuqiaqing Road, east of Xiaoshadu Road, north of Avenue Foch, and the north and south sections of Route Robert. Italian troops were responsible for the area west of Xiaoshadu Road and all of the extra-settlement roads. French troops were responsible for the order of the entire French Concession.</p>
<p>Traffic Interrupted; Strict Searches</p>
<p>In addition, unnecessary roads along Edward VII Avenue and Xizang Road, such as Jiangxi Road, Zhu Baosan Road, Jixiang Street, Zilai Street, Daigou Bridge, Route Macgregor, Mofan Street, Yunnan Road, Guangxi Road, East and West Water and Fire Streets, Balibao Street, Longmen Road, Danshui Road, Chongqing Road, Route Pere Robert, Route Marcel Tillot, and Route Massenet, were all blocked with barbed wire, interrupting traffic. Only the Bund, Sichuan Road, Cathedral Street, Henan Road, Old North Gate Street, Fujian Road, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, Great World, Tongfu Road, Rue Sainte-Marie, Seymour Road, and Great West Road allowed passage, with searches being conducted.</p>
<p>Bridges Blocked; Routes Shortened</p>
<p>At the same time, bridges along the Suzhou Creek, such as the Water Works Bridge, Pentang Nong Bridge, and Xizang Road Bridge, were all blocked. Only the Tianhou Palace Bridge allowed pedestrians and vehicles to pass, and the Old Zha Gate Bridge only allowed pedestrians to pass. The Zhejiang Road Bridge only allowed vehicles to pass. A large number of detectives were stationed on both sides of the bridges that were open to traffic, conducting searches. Even buses and trams were subject to inspection. The situation was even more strict than during the "January 28th Incident." The British-operated Route 16 trolleybus, which originally ran between Sanyangjing Bridge and Caojiadu, temporarily shortened its route due to the closure of the iron gate on Route Robert, and turned around at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Route Robert. Route 18 trolleybus, which originally ran between the Great World and the North Railway Station, turned at Nicheng Bridge and traveled north via Beijing Road and Tianhou Palace Bridge due to the closure of the Xizang Road Bridge.</p>
<p>Armored Vehicle Convoys; Tight Patrols</p>
<p>In addition to the special security measures on the roads and bridges, inspection teams of men and women, vehicle patrols, armored vehicle convoys, and garrison patrol teams patrolled back and forth on the roads. Attention was paid to the areas bordering the Chinese districts. A large number of armored vehicles and reserve teams were stationed in the western district for preventative measures. In the past, people could walk on the streets as early as 5:00 AM, but yesterday, in accordance with martial law, free movement was not allowed until 6:00 AM. Trolleybuses and buses were also delayed until 5:45 AM before leaving the depot. After 12:30 AM, no one without a pass or permit was allowed to travel. The curfew was strictly enforced. This morning at 0:00, the emergency measures were lifted and the original state was restored.</p>
<p>Japanese Side in Hongkou Also Imposes Security</p>
<p>As for the Japanese side, due to anti-Japanese patriots being active in their occupied areas, they increased the number of posts at various key points on land and water and at various bridges in Hongkou, such as the Yalu Road Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Li Hong Bridge, Outer Hong Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, and Jiaxing Road Bridge, searching pedestrians and vehicles. Concession troops, in groups of three to five, patrolled back and forth in the British and Japanese security areas north of the Suzhou Creek, and along the areas of North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road.</p>
<p>Rental Cars Forced to Display Flags</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that today (30th), some cars of the city's rental car companies were forced to display flags promoting the puppet "New Regime," causing resentment among Chinese passengers. However, the drivers and car companies, fearing threats, did not dare to tear down the flags. This was because this morning, the Dadao Police intercepted rental cars outside the concession area, in front of dance halls and gambling dens within the car companies, and while driving on the road. They stuck Kuomintang flags on the windshields of each car, and yellow triangular flags with the words "Peace and National Construction" on the rear windows, and then warned the drivers not to tear down the flags today, otherwise, they would be subject to extremely unpleasant punishment if discovered. The drivers had no choice, so when passengers saw these flags, many asked to have them torn down, but to no avail. The reporter recently inquired about this matter with Major Boween, the head of the Public Concession Police, who replied that the police department takes a neutral view on this matter and does not need to interfere. Whether or not to tear down the flags on the cars should be decided by the car companies.</p>

<p>Suddenly Derails</p>
<p>The engine and two third-class carriages derailed outside the tracks. No passengers were seriously injured; some suffered minor abrasions that did not require hospitalization.

<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Taierzhuang Victory. All sectors of the city made spiritual commemorations in a solemn and respectful atmosphere, resolving to emulate the aspirations of the martyred soldiers and steadfastly uphold the belief in resistance and reconstruction. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Taierzhuang Victory Commemoration</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the unprecedented victory at Taierzhuang. Although various sectors of industry, commerce, banking, and finance in the city were unable to hold grand commemorative ceremonies or celebrations due to the environment, they all made spiritual commemorations of the meaning of the victory in a solemn, respectful, steadfast, and determined atmosphere. On the one hand, they rejoiced in the nation's good fortune and looked forward to the final victory. On the other hand, they all vowed to emulate the aspirations of the martyred soldiers and complete the great task of resisting the war and building the nation. Although the city did not fly flags yesterday to mark the occasion, the belief in loyalty and courage became even more solid.</p>
<p>Commemorative Leaflets Scattered Everywhere</p>
<p>Yesterday, various sectors of the city did not hold commemorative ceremonies, as instructed by the authorities. However, patriotic organizations formed by the general public, in order to express their firm national spirit and support the national policy of resistance, distributed leaflets everywhere.

<p>Unwilling to Be Exploited by the Puppet Regime; Unable to Maintain the Original State</p>
<p>The city's table salt has been supplied by the Upper South Sichuan Salt Depot. Before the Shanghai war, the salt depot was located on Anlan Road in Nanshi. During the war, the entire area was destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in significant losses. It then moved its office to the Central Building on Edward VII Avenue to facilitate external liaison. After the fall of Nanshi, the puppet "Salt Affairs Bureau" was officially established, and puppet officials came to the office to negotiate cooperation between the two sides. The person in charge of the office understood the greater good and the initial negotiations were fruitless. Later, the puppet side went again, offering bribes and even offering more favorable conditions, but they were still rejected. After the puppet "Bureau" failed to reach an agreement after repeated negotiations, it became angry and resentful, so it sent people three times to threaten with words and even issued written warnings. After receiving the warning letter from the puppet "Bureau," the office convened a meeting the day before yesterday and all agreed that under the current serious threat, it was impossible to maintain the original state. In order to fulfill the national duty and even more unwilling to be exploited by the puppet side, a resolution was passed to dissolve the company with immediate effect. All remaining staff were also given severance pay and dismissed.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Reviewing Files; Chinese Directors Busy Negotiating</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, facing a 150% to 200% increase in business license fees by the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited all Chinese Directors to request that the Municipal Council rescind its decision or reduce the increased tax rate. All of the Chinese Directors have formally approached the Municipal Council, requesting that the method of reducing the tax on the hotel industry in 1933 be followed to reduce the burden on taxpayers. The Municipal Council is now reviewing the files and, it is reported, will follow the method within the realm of possibility. However, as this matter will be implemented tomorrow (April 1st), all members of the Hotel Industry Association have been busy negotiating with the Chinese Directors in recent days.</p>

<p>Report from the Annual Meeting of the Automobile Association of China</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Automobile Association of China held its annual meeting at No. 17 The Bund on the 29th. Stephen Badeau, Chairman of the Association, presented a report urging the lifting of all restrictions on the free movement of traffic on the highways connecting Shanghai to the interior. The report, read by Deputy Chairman Franklin, stated that the quickest way to restore the normal use of highways was to lift restrictions and allow the free movement of traffic. Although the war had long moved away from the Shanghai area, the term "military necessity" still made land travel temporarily impossible. In addition to the restrictions,</p>
<p>The poor road surface made automobile travel extremely uncomfortable. Although the Association has not been able to investigate the road conditions, according to the information received, the road surface has been severely damaged in the past two and a half years. Once the highways are opened and free passage is allowed, it will not take long to repair the road surface. Shanghai's</p>
<p>The traffic situation remains extremely unsatisfactory. Unless Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Nanshi are opened without restriction to reduce the current population congestion, there is little hope for improvement in the city's traffic situation. The "Safety First" campaign held last year was very successful, but citizens seem to have forgotten the lessons learned.</p>

<p>Due to damaged machinery, the salvage work on the sunken Scythia has been temporarily suspended. The Scythia Relief Association, believing that there are still corpses and luggage left in the ship, hired the China Salvage Company to continue the salvage work starting at 9:00 AM on the 26th. The underwater work of salvaging the sunken ship was contracted by the ship owner to the salvage company, with a daily wage of 120 yuan in national currency. The onshore work was handled by the ship owner themselves. As the salvage machinery has not been fully completed, the work has been in progress for nearly ten days without progress. The shipowner's losses have reached more than 2,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Java-China-Japan Lijn's Tjisadane, coming from Surabaya, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (Monday). According to the company's announcement yesterday, the ship will arrive in Shanghai at noon today. Passengers will transfer to the company's prepared small boats and land at the New Customs Wharf at approximately 2:00 PM. However, the ship is carrying a large amount of cargo, approximately 4,500 tons, resulting in a heavy load and deep draft. Therefore, it is uncertain whether it can enter the port this afternoon at the Wusongkou due to the receding tide. If it is not possible, it must anchor outside the port and wait until the tide rises at around 5:00 PM to enter the port. Passenger disembarkation will also be postponed.</p>

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war in August 1937, some shipping companies have failed to pay the taxes on imported goods within the tax payment period, and goods that have not been taxed have been temporarily treated as free due to the extraordinary circumstances. From now on, all taxes and extension fees due on the above-mentioned goods shall be paid by the shipping companies in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of the ship's annual report.</p>

<p>The annual meeting of Western taxpayers is scheduled to be held at the Race Club on the 19th of next month. However, it is reported that the rules of this session, such as Articles 7, 8, and 9, will be changed. According to the voting method, hand-raising could have been used, but it was feared that it would be difficult for the chairman to count. The new rules have decided to adopt a classification method, with "For" and "Against" doors set up. A reporter will be assigned to each door to count the number of people. The number of votes for and against will be calculated based on the number of people passing through each door. If the number of votes is the same on both sides, the chairman can cast a vote as a taxpayer to decide. The new rules also stipulate that only those who have one or more votes in the voters' list can obtain the list of names from the Taxpayers' Association. When someone passes through the "For" and "Against" doors, the reporter should count the number of votes they are representing. In addition to the above three articles, the existing rules of procedure can still be used. The Shanghai Municipal Council has also solemnly stated that anyone wishing to propose a resolution or ask a question at this annual meeting of Western taxpayers must submit it in writing to the Secretary of the Municipal Council seven days before the meeting. The Council will only accept proposals with the formal signatures of the proposer and the seconder. As for motions made on the floor, they must arise directly from the agenda being discussed.</p>

<p>Recently, counterfeit two-cent National Government stamp tax stamps have been discovered in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The patterns are crude and the printing is more blurred than genuine stamps. Some people have been holding these counterfeit stamps. Because there is currently a shortage of genuine one-cent and two-cent stamps, a few shops have failed to examine them closely, resulting in accidental purchases. The Party Bureau has noticed this matter and is conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to reorganize the suspended banknotes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks in Hankou, will issue long-term public bonds of 45 million yuan, named the "Long-Term Financial Public Bonds of the Republic of China, Year 17," designated with surplus customs duties as collateral. Since the customs duties in the occupied areas were seized, payment of principal and interest had to be temporarily suspended. Now,</p>
<p>the thirteenth time</p>
<p>for principal and interest repayment, the principal repayment is 1,125,000 yuan, and the interest payment is 393,750 yuan. After consultation between the National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, an agreement was reached on discount payment. It is heard that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, upon the order of the head office, will make payments starting from March 31st, with Shanghai paying in six installments and also paying for remittance transfers. After receiving the order, the bank has made all preparations. Because the 31st falls on a Sunday, a regular holiday, the discount payment is scheduled to start on April 1st (Monday). All bondholders can obtain discount application forms from the Central, China, and Communications Banks.</p>
<p>Payment in Installments</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 18th repayment of principal for the 24th Year Public Bonds of the Republic of China, amounting to 400,000 yuan; the 7th repayment of principal for the 25th Year Reorganization of Guangdong Financial Public Bonds, amounting to 1,200,000 yuan; and the 6th repayment of principal for the 26th Year Guangdong-Hong Kong River Dredging Project U.S. Dollar Bonds, amounting to 40,000 U.S. dollars, are all scheduled to begin payment on March 31st. It is heard that in Shanghai, due to the lack of circulation of the aforementioned telecommunications and other three types of public bonds, there is temporarily no organization handling the payment of principal and interest.</p>

<p>The lists of candidates for the upcoming election of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors have been selected by the British and American communities and will be retained until the end of this month, to be submitted before April 2nd. It is heard that the Shanghai Consular Corps has sent letters to relevant parties, urging that the lists of candidates be submitted uniformly before the deadline. The election of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors for 1940 is scheduled to be held on April 11th.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Shanghai Municipal Council Announces: Statement of Budget Estimates <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The biggest reason for the increase is due to the depreciation of the national currency and the contraction of exchange rates, which has led to a sharp increase in the exchange allowances for staff pensions and other retirement funds that the bureau should pay according to regulations. As for the increase in the aforementioned "extra expenses in various departments," it is due to the recent decision to provide rice subsidies to lower-level Chinese staff.</p>
<p>London Agents: Regarding the amount of remuneration for the London agents, the bureau has reached an agreement with the agents to revise it. As a result, this expense is expected to save about 50,000 yuan this year.</p>
<p>Education Department: The education expenditure budget for this year, after revision, totals 3,262,970 yuan, an increase of 923,050 yuan over the previous year. The reason for the increase is largely due to the depreciation of the national currency and the rise in commodity prices. It has been stipulated that education expenditure should not exceed 2% of the total tax rate (equivalent to 2,711,400 yuan). Therefore, this year's education expenditure, excluding miscellaneous income, is estimated to require a deficit of approximately 509,590 yuan. When submitting the aforementioned budget, the Education Committee attached a proposal to abolish the above-mentioned method of limiting the amount of education expenditure. The Finance Committee did not approve this proposal. However, in view of the current abnormal situation, all education expenditure budgets for this year were temporarily approved, and the Education Committee was requested to consider raising tuition fees as soon as possible, and the heads of the Finance and Education Departments were requested to further review the aspect of saving expenses.</p>
<p>Prisons: The bureau has now formed a special sub-committee to consider whether the amount of food required for prisoners in prisons can be appropriately reduced.</p>
<p>Libraries: 20,000 yuan has been approved this year for the library to purchase new materials.</p>
<p>The above budgets have been submitted by the Finance Committee to the Board of Directors and passed at a meeting on the 20th of this month. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e68">Dozens of Gangsters: Attempt to Rob Gold Bars Foiled; Gold Bars Worth Over 100,000 Nearly Robbed <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>A large gang of robbers attempted to rob gold bars in western Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 29th). The incident occurred at around 1 p.m. the day before yesterday when the Tongfeng Silver Smelting Workshop in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, western Shanghai, was entrusted by a certain silver shop on Nanjing Road to melt gold nuggets into gold bars. At that time, the workshop had finished melting, and a number of gold bars worth over 100,000 yuan were placed under the seat cushions of a private car. The workshop sent guards to escort the gold bars. However, as the car was driving out of the lane, a large group of gangsters, about 20 or more, suddenly appeared, ten of whom drew pistols, ordering the car to stop and threatening the driver with guns. Several robbers then began to thoroughly search the body of the guards in the car. Because they found nothing, they shouted in frustration and fled. At that time, the robbers did not check the seat cushions, so the gold bars were safe and sound. Afterwards, the workshop reported to the police and the nearby Volunteer Corps headquarters. Therefore, after the incident, the Volunteer Corps once mobilized to stand guard.</p>
<p>Fuxin Flour Mill: Workers' Armed Fight; Injured in Hospital; Perpetrators Arrested and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Yu Jinzhi, a worker at the Fuxin Flour Seventh Factory, No. 101, Lane 109, Chengdu Road, had previously contracted work in the factory and hired more than 100 workers. However, Yu suddenly resigned recently, and the factory hired Xue Yougui as the new foreman. According to the regulations, the workers have no direct relationship with the factory. Therefore, when the foreman resigns, the workers also lose their jobs. At about 10 a.m. on the 28th of this month, was</p>
<p>the time for handover between old and new workers.</p>
<p>To prevent problems, the factory had reported in advance to the Xin Zha Police Station, which dispatched Western Constables No. 281, West Third Road Head, and Chinese Constables No. 2609, 2418, 486, and 2515 to be stationed. The new foreman, Xue Yougui, was also well aware that the old workers might take action during the handover. He hired two Shangtian Moving Company trucks and led 55 workers to the factory. Unexpectedly, when the trucks arrived at the gate of the Fuxin Factory on West Suzhou Road, they were blocked by more than 100 old workers, leading to</p>
<p>a conflict and a mutual brawl.</p>
<p>The weapons used were carrying poles, iron bars, spears, truncheons, and lime powder bags. In the midst of the melee, the front of the two Moving Company trucks was destroyed, with losses estimated at approximately 1,500 yuan. On the side of the new workers, twelve people, including Su Shiyuan, Pan Wenlin, Yan Junsheng, and Li Baoyu, were injured. Among them, Guo Yuanzhi was the most seriously injured. The Western Constable who was suppressing the scene was also beaten severely by these people, and was hit on the head by a flower pot, causing him to lose consciousness. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Chinese and Western Constables had to</p>
<p>use their guns in self-defense,</p>
<p>firing dozens of rounds, wounding two old workers, Liang Youwang, Huang Hong, and Huang Xuecai, as well as a passerby, a barber named Gao Jinfu, by stray bullets. They were sent to the hospital for treatment. The police also arrested four old workers who started the trouble: Liu Debiao, Hong Youzhui, Li Gaowang, and Liu Wenqi, along with eight carrying poles, three spears, one iron bar, and a quantity of lime powder, and took them all to the police station. Chinese Detective Wang Shidong then began</p>
<p>an investigation.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, except for the injured, the other four, Liu Debiao, Hong Youguo, Li Gaowang, and Liu Wenqi, were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges of disrupting public order and presented the case, requesting a postponement. The defendants then retained lawyers Wang Yaotang and Yu Enliang to defend them in court. Judge Fu ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed to April 5th.</p>

<p>Gong Xuesan, a 37-year-old Yangzhou native living at No. 271 Julai Road in the French Concession, runs a coal briquette business. Gong's wife, Ms. Wei, is 23 years old. At 4 p.m. on the 29th of this month, Ms. Wei was in bed with her second son, named Xuesheng, who was just three months old. Ms. Wei fell asleep for a moment. Gong's eldest son, named Chusheng, who is five years old, was also in the room. He saw a Lysol bottle on the table, picked it up, and poured some out to play with. The child, without knowing the danger, then saw that his younger brother, Xuesheng, was awake in bed. Chusheng then poured the Lysol into a spoon and fed it to Xuesheng, causing Xuesheng to convulse from poisoning and cry loudly. Ms. Wei woke up from her sleep when she heard the child crying and realized what had happened. She immediately told the child's father. They sent the baby to Guangci Hospital, but because the poisonous liquid had already entered his abdominal organs, treatment was ineffective. He died at 2:30 p.m. yesterday.</p>

<p>The hooligan Shi Heshang, a native of Changzhou, together with his accomplice Yang Chunlin (nickname "Little Green Dragon"), a native of Yangzhou, extorted money from Feng Chunshan, a truck driver of Tailong Coal Yard, at the southern end of Wuzhen Road Bridge on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, for parking the truck there. Feng was stabbed to death on the spot by Yang Chunlin with a sharp knife, and the arm of the worker Li Deyi was also stabbed. After the incident, Yang took the opportunity to flee, and Shi Heshang was detained. Until the night before last, Chinese Detective Weng Peiyu of the Xin Zha Police Station arrested the main culprit, Yang Chunlin, and sent him back to the First Special Court yesterday for detention pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Sun Dingchen, a 25-year-old youth from Jiangyin, who lives at No. 30 Huanlong Road, was adopted by his parents at the age of seven as a child bride for his same-age compatriot Cao Donglin. When Sun was seventeen years old, he expressed his opposition to this old-fashioned marriage and requested that the engagement be dissolved. Recently, Sun hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Cao Donglin for dissolution of the engagement. The court, based on the complaint, was tried in the Seventh Civil Division by Judge Li Liang. Yesterday morning, the court ruled that the engagement between Sun Dingchen and Cao Donglin was dissolved, and the litigation costs were borne by the defendant.</p>
<p>Lu Qikai, a native of Nanxiang and a partner at Bao Xing Pawnshop at No. 172 Route Labor神父 (Route du Père-Robert), was arrested by the French police in January for receiving stolen hats belonging to the hat-snatching gang Zhao Yuelong. He was then sent to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Minsheng sentenced Zhao Yuelong to two years in prison, and Lu Qikai to eight months in prison for continuously insuring stolen goods. Lu was dissatisfied with the verdict and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Third High Court. Yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi ruled to overturn the original verdict, finding Lu Qikai not guilty.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to an article in your newspaper on March 30, which reported a news story about a wife accusing her husband of adultery. I was greatly shocked. My wife, Yin Junnong, has not returned to her husband's home for a long time. For the past three to five years, she has been living in her parents' home, which your newspaper refers to as initially living in a foreign-style house at No. 60, Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai, and then at the residence at No. 553 Lafayette Road, which I originally rented for the purpose of setting up a small family with Yin Junnong. On the day of the court hearing, my wife and I went out and there was no such thing as posting bail of 3,000 yuan. The statements in your newspaper that I do not engage in legitimate work and am a dissolute person are absolutely untrue. I respectfully request that you correct the record. Therefore, I am writing to you, hoping that you will investigate and deal with the matter accordingly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Le Junwei</p>

<p>The first New Six Cup Team Table Tennis Championship organized by Zhejiang Industrial Bank will have the final match between the defending champion Qingyun Jia and the Friendly Nations team tonight. The two teams will decide the champion at the Eight Immortals Bridge Central Youth Gymnasium at 6:30 p.m. The tournament starts with an exhibition match between the two strong female table tennis teams, Female Youth and Hualian Women. At that time, honorary chairman Shen Shuxiong will give the awards, and Xu Jiying will give a speech. The referees specially hired Chen Linsheng, Xu Duo, Ding Du, Fu Zhongqiu, and Yu Binqi to take charge. According to the current strength of the Friendly Nations team, it is very strong. In the International Cup final last week, it was unfortunate that the lineup was wrongly arranged, resulting in losing to Qingyun's hand.

Qingyun Jia is a victorious teacher. Lu Hanjun, Li Zongpei, Zhang Zhihong and others are known for their intelligence and skill. Supplemented by the cutting hand Zhang Ying and the hard draw Lang Depei and Chen Zhensheng, their strength is becoming more and more powerful. Although the Friendly Nations team is fierce and good at fighting, it may still be difficult to resist Qingyun's edge. However, a dramatic battle will definitely have a wonderful performance. The tickets are divided into 50 cents, one yuan, two yuan, and three kinds of yuan. The list of four teams is as follows:</p>
<p>(Female Youth) He Xuchu (leader), Huang Tongyin (captain) Zhang Yongru, Huang Guangmei, Fang Xiuwen, Zhu Shangxin, Xu Ruilan, Yang Chengdi, Tao Lanying, Wang Mingxia, Qu Lanzhen,</p>

<h3 id="e81">Western Youth Association's Humiliating Anti-China Performance <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Circus performance hosted by the Western Youth Association at the gymnasium the other night, featured a segment titled "Shanghai Street Vendor" in which the performers dressed as vulgar Chinese people and put on an abominable show. The rampant insults against the Chinese people were outrageous. This was worse than the old days when foreigners, unaware of China's current situation, used queues and bound feet to represent China. The Chinese audience in attendance booed, but the organizers and performers ignored them. As a result, some audience members left their seats and exited. Mr. Bratt, the Western Youth Association's athletic director, has always had good relations with the Chinese athletic community. It is deeply regrettable that such an event insulting the Chinese people occurred while Mr. Bratt was away from Shanghai and under the direction of Xia Bao. It is hoped that the athletic community and public opinion will urge the Western Youth Association authorities to rectify this situation and guarantee that similar events will not occur again. Otherwise, to maintain national dignity, the Chinese community should withdraw from all competitions organized by the Western Youth Association to show their refusal to cooperate.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Commercial News: Finance: Hong Kong Gold Prices Rise; Gold Sets New Record, Breaching the 5,400 Yuan Mark <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai cash market suddenly experienced a vigorous surge, especially at noon, surpassing the 5,400 yuan mark. As the end of the month approached, many short positions held by parties without strong backing were gradually being liquidated. Meanwhile, foreign exchange rates were stable for British currency but tight for American currency, and Hong Kong gold prices reported significant increases, leading to increased activity among new bullish investors. The morning started fairly stable, opening at 5,360 yuan. Due to the need to redeem cash collateral, the long positions were squeezed, and the price dipped to 5,340 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market tightened, the price gradually recovered. At noon, buying intensified, and Hong Kong gold prices surged, causing the price to soar past 5,400 yuan, reaching 5,413 yuan. The noon closing price was 5,410 yuan, an increase of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday settlement holiday, the price rose further to 5,435 yuan. The total transaction volume in the first half of the day was over 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold rose by 5 yuan, reaching 545 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Intense Buying at Noon</p>
<p>Although the US dollar exchange rate fell sharply from the opening price per tael (ten liang) in the morning, the market was unable to rally due to the month-end financial situation. Instead, there were more sellers, causing the opening price to rise by only 5 yuan. Gold shops bought ten taels from silver shops for 5,360 yuan. Subsequently, some spot gold dealers took advantage of the low prices to absorb the gold, and a certain securities firm also made significant purchases, driving the price up by 20 yuan. The securities firm bought ten taels from silver shops for 5,380 yuan. However, gold shops and silver shops took the opportunity to sell aggressively, and two-cash exchange shops showed a strong desire to sell. At that time, the US dollar exchange rate eased, and buyers hesitated, gradually lowering the price by 40 yuan. Gold shops sold ten taels to cash exchange shops for 5,340 yuan. After that, a certain silver shop suddenly reversed course and started buying, stabilizing the market slightly. The price hovered around 5,350 yuan. Unexpectedly, around 11:10 am, buying intensified sharply in the market. Cash exchange shops switched from selling to buying, securities firms resumed heavy buying, and silver shops continued to purchase. In addition, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and the number of sellers decreased, causing the price to jump by 73 yuan. Cash exchange shops bought 30 taels from gold shops for 9,413 yuan. The noon closing price was slightly lower at 5,410 yuan, with cash exchange shops selling 20 taels to securities firms. As a result, the closing price was 55 yuan higher than the previous day. The price fluctuated by 73 yuan throughout the day. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday settlement holiday, it was reported that the price had been pushed up to around 5,435 yuan outside the market due to buying by securities firms and cash exchange shops. Cash shops sold their gold at higher prices than the spot market, while buying prices were reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and trading was minimal.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold at 545 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in the morning was still 540 yuan at large Tonghang stores. Around noon, the price was increased by 5 yuan. There were no further changes after that. As a result, the large Tonghang stores revised their price to 545 yuan. The new Tonghang stores set the same price as the previous price. Buying prices were reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Chinese Merchants Continually Buying, US Dollar Exchange Rate Tightens Again in the Afternoon <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The informal market for British and American currencies only lasted for half a day and tended to be calm. However, Chinese merchants mostly held bullish views and continually bought forward contracts. Fortunately, Chinese banks still had a willingness to supply, so the market was able to remain stable. In the morning, overseas British and American exchange rates fell by 7.375 points, causing the market to return to a state of stable British currency and tight American currency, at 4 shillings 1 40625 and 6.0625 yuan, respectively. Shortly after, foreign banks showed a willingness to sell, and Chinese merchants engaged in some buying, but the situation had already eased slightly. At this time, the US dollar strengthened to 6.09375 yuan. Later, speculators continued their activities, but Chinese banks such as Overseas Chinese and Mainland banks supplied each other, offsetting their positions. As a result, the market was once very stable. However, around 11 am, the number of sellers decreased, causing the market to soften again. Therefore, by the noon closing, the US dollar had tightened again to 6.0625 yuan. The British gold price was still quoted at 4 shillings 1 40625 (equivalent to a British-US exchange rate of 3.51375 yuan). As a result, the British exchange rate was stable compared to the previous day, and the US exchange rate was tighter by 0.09375. The futures market trend was similar to the spot market for British gold, with no significant changes from the previous day. The US dollar exchange rate, however, tightened again.</p>
<p>In the morning, London large-denomination notes were stable for both near-term and long-term contracts. New York silver was also stable. London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rates for British currency against US dollars, Shanghai currency, and French currency were all stable. The US dollar depreciated slightly by 7.375 points against British currency, decreased by 1 jiao against Shanghai currency, and decreased slightly by 4 points against French currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings 1 40625 for British gold and 6.0625 yuan for US dollars, reflecting stable British currency and tighter US currency by 0.09375 compared to the previous closing prices, due to the depreciation of the foreign exchange rate. After the opening, foreign banks showed a strong willingness to sell, and the market eased slightly. It was reported that speculators sold US dollars for April delivery at 5.9375 yuan. At that time, spot US dollars could be settled at 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced without change. The balance tax on silver was announced to be one cent higher. After that, although Chinese merchants continued their activities, Chinese banks and foreign banks still showed a willingness to supply, resulting in a long period of market stability. It was reported that speculators bought British gold for April delivery at 4 shillings 046875, and also bought US dollars for the same month from Mainland China at 5.90625 yuan. Around 11 am, the willingness of sellers weakened slightly, and the market situation tightened again. It was reported that Chinese merchants bought US dollars for April delivery from Chinese banks at 5.875 yuan. At that time, spot US dollars were difficult to settle at 6.0625 yuan. However, by the noon closing, British gold was at 4 shillings 1 40625, US dollars were at 6.0625 yuan, British gold for April delivery was at 4 shillings 046875, US dollars were at 5.90625 yuan, British gold for May delivery was at 3 shillings 96875, and US dollars were at 5.75 yuan. As a result, compared to the 7th, spot British currency was stable, US currency was weaker by 0.09375, next month's British currency was stable, and US currency was reduced by 0.0625. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Foreign Currencies Rise Again <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was strong demand for British and American gold pounds, as the sudden rise in Hong Kong gold prices caused the Shanghai spot market to surge. There were many sellers of British gold notes in the morning, but the market suddenly turned firm in the afternoon. American gold notes also saw increased demand due to the softening of the pound price, generally rising for repurchase. The morning price rose to 16.27 yuan, then briefly softened as some profit-takers sold off their holdings. However, the price soon rebounded, reaching 16.42 yuan in the evening market. Hong Kong notes continued to trend downward. There was some supply of French franc notes. Dutch and Philippine notes remained in strong demand. Japanese gold notes had already started to rise, reaching 1.285 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes broke through the 1 yuan mark again, reaching 1.005 yuan in the evening market.

<p>Yesterday, the rediscount rate for bills of exchange rose sharply, exceeding 60 yuan per thousand yuan. In the morning, it rose from 61.5 yuan to 64 yuan.

<h3 id="e86">Grains: Siamese Rice: Over 28,000 Bags <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The rice market this morning saw various kinds of foreign rice rise by 5 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao due to continued active trading by local and visiting merchants. First-grade Saigon rice traded at 44.5 yuan, second-grade at 41 yuan, fire-milled rice at 43.5 yuan, and small-milled rice at 40 yuan. However, speculative and retail traders were not as firm as before, and instead of buying more, they took advantage of the high prices to sell their holdings, creating a crowded market. This caused visiting merchants to become wary, and both mainland merchants and local shops hesitated to buy more, taking a wait-and-see approach. Sales gradually slowed down, the market became more crowded, and the overall situation reversed, with prices declining. As a result, not only were the morning gains erased, but prices also fell further by 6 or 7 jiao. The closing prices were only 43.5 yuan for first-grade Saigon rice, 40 yuan for second-grade, 39.8 yuan, 43 yuan for fire-milled rice, 42.5 yuan, 39.12 yuan for small-milled rice, and 39 yuan. Only mixed broken rice and rice bran, due to limited supply and broad demand, remained strong, increasing by about 5 jiao. Although glutinous rice briefly tightened in the morning, it softened due to the influence of foreign rice. Liyang special yuan rice sold for 38.5 yuan, which was also 4 or 5 jiao lower than the previous market. The informal market for thick and thin japonica rice also reportedly tightened first and then weakened, but ultimately remained flat, similar to the previous situation.</p>
<p>A large quantity of foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Danish merchant firm Cheng Yang Line's Nuihock Meihe Wheel brought over 2,500 tons of foreign rice from Siam, totaling over 28,000 bags. It arrived at the port at 4:30 pm yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou around 6:00 pm. Unloading is scheduled to begin this morning. Today, 2,566 bags of foreign rice, loaded onto Jardine Matheson's Yisheng Wheel, will be transported to Yantai (Zu).</p>
<p>Spot sales of foreign rice were active in the morning. In addition to mainland merchants continuing to buy, merchants from both North and South came to the market to inquire. Sellers took advantage of the low exchange rate to raise prices, increasing the prices of Saigon, Siam, and small and large milled rice by about one yuan. However, as prices rose, floating traders sold their holdings, and the release of futures rice also had an impact. The spot rice market had already retreated by 3 or 4 jiao by noon. The return of futures rice was due to scattered long positions being closed out. The morning market had failed to rise in tandem with spot rice. The afternoon saw a surge in selling pressure, and the market fell sharply. Therefore, the return of futures rice was 5 or 6 jiao lower than the previous day. The highest price for second-grade Saigon rice was 50 yuan, and the afternoon price was 49.2 yuan. Small-milled rice was 48.5 yuan, once quoted at 49 yuan, and fell to 47.2 yuan in the afternoon. First-grade Saigon rice opened at 52.75 yuan. The total trading volume for futures was 500-600 tons, and for spot rice, 5,000 bags. The sales price of British-China Shipping Company's original packages of foreign rice is as follows:</p>
<p>April delivery for first-grade Saigon rice: 52.70 to 52.50</p>
<p>Spot delivery: 52.00</p>
<p>April delivery for second-grade Saigon rice: 50.00 to 49.50</p>
<p>Spot delivery: 49.20 to 49.00</p>
<p>Delivery in 2-3 weeks for small-milled rice: 48.50 to 48.30</p>
<p>Spot delivery: 48.00 to 47.20</p>
<p>April delivery for Saigon broken rice: 41.30</p>
<p>Rice and paddy market in Wuxi: Since the 29th, the weather has cleared, and boats carrying rice are arriving in succession. Negotiable packages have shifted to a wait-and-see approach. Although rice mills are selling, they need to wait for previously placed orders to be fulfilled before discussing further business. Some sellers are eager to unload their goods, and rice prices have been falling sharply in recent days. High-quality white japonica rice has fallen from 26.5 yuan per dan to within the 25 yuan mark. High-quality brown rice has fallen from 25 yuan to within 24 yuan, a decrease of 1.35 yuan. Japonica paddy rice has fallen from 13 yuan per dan to 12.3 yuan, a decrease of 7 or 8 jiao to 1 yuan. On the 29th, the market price of brown and white japonica rice rebounded by 5 or 6 jiao. According to a review of this year's red market, the Rice Association has sold over 70,000 dan of rice to Japanese merchants in batches on behalf of its members. In addition, a large quantity of food rice in this city, along with flat rice, totals over 100,000 dan, which should offset the more than 200,000 dan of paddy rice stored for the New Year. Based on the current stock of paddy rice in various warehouses and factories, there should be nearly 600,000 dan. This shows that since the beginning of this spring, the supply has not been weak. If there is no large outlet to Japanese merchants, the accumulation will increase, and rice prices will inevitably fall again (Liang).</p>
<h3 id="e87">Flour and Wheat Tend to be Quiet; Over 6,000 Tons of New Foreign Wheat Arrive <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was quiet yesterday. Since the expiration of the flat-price flour promotion, the factory price had increased to 13.8 yuan, leading to a decrease in retail sales in this street. Each store's daily wholesale volume was only 5,000-6,000 bags. Merchants going to places like Beiyang and Tianjin found it difficult to make a profit on the shipments, and the merchants' price was as high as 15 yuan, resulting in sluggish trading. The opening price for the returned old-brand flour was 13.72 yuan, and the afternoon price was 13.7 yuan, slightly weaker than before due to depleted inventory. It was reported that the "Warship" brand transfer inventory could not be exported and was priced at only 13.3 yuan. The "Double Lion" brand was priced at 13.22 yuan. The factory price was still 13.8 yuan. In addition, 3,300 bags of flour will be shipped to Yantai today.</p>
<p>The wheat market was also quiet yesterday. Recently, due to tight credit conditions, new囤戶 were rarely seen, and exporting merchants and Japanese factories showed little interest. It was reported that Fufeng Factory had a new ship of fixed-price wheat arrive, totaling over 6,000 tons, which is currently being unloaded. Another 8,000 tons of American wheat is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month, and more will follow. However, the national wheat situation is such that existing inventory is depleted, and new supply has not yet arrived, making it difficult for the market to ease. Yesterday, Fufeng sold 1,000 bags of wheat to Changzhou at a price of 23.5 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with prices rising sharply. This was because Hong Kong merchants directly purchased 20-count Double Horse yarn from Shenxin No. 9 Factory at a spot price of 980 yuan. As a result, market enthusiasm ran high, and some buyers became even more eager, making the market even tighter. The market price gradually rose. The April price for 20-count Double Horse yarn initially traded at 1,045 yuan and closed at 1,061 yuan, an increase of 21 yuan from the previous day. However, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets were weak, so there were also sellers trying to unload their holdings. The previous day, Shenxin Factory offered 1,000 bags of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 980 yuan and 150 bags of 20-count New Heavenly Maiden yarn at 988 yuan, all for cash payment, and were purchased by Hong Kong merchants.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened stable in the morning. It was reported that British and American exchange rates had tightened, and the situation had tightened slightly. The April price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,045 yuan. Subsequently, it was reported that the US dollar had strengthened, and bulls were very active, buying more shares and boosting the market price, reaching 1,064 yuan. The price then pulled back slightly after closing. It was reported that there was increased fatherly encouragement in the afternoon. The total trading volume for the day was 3,560 bags. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 21 yuan. On the 31st, 18 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, 15 bales to Hong Kong, 115 bales to Guangzhou Bay, 10 bales to Haikou, and 720 bales to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each merchant is as follows:</p>
<p>Tonghang: 1,995, Hong Kong: 1,230</p>
<p>Yunnan: 280, Ningbo: 55</p>
<p>Total: 3,580</p>

<p>The raw cotton market was very quiet. The factory showed no signs of improvement, so although the yarn market continued to rise, the cotton market was not affected at all. This was because the price of raw cotton was declining and cheaper. The current situation of raw cotton is as follows:</p>
<p>Another message: Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very quiet in the morning, but the market was relatively firm. Later, due to the selling of spot goods and the dumping by some overseas cotton merchants, the market weakened. As a result, the closing price rose by 2 points for near-term contracts and fell by 4 points for long-term contracts. India fell by 1 rupee, including forecasts. Egypt was stable.</p>
<p>The trading of Shanghai spot foreign cotton was subdued due to the month-end and tight credit conditions. Traders showed little interest in buying raw cotton. The factory also showed no intention of buying. It is unlikely that there will be any improvement within the day. The factory price for the cotton market yesterday, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6.0625, is as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Midling: 288.90</p>
<p>20-count Below Grade: 277.50</p>
<p>32-count: 304.70</p>
<p>32-count Below Grade: 293.50</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trading of yellow beans was very scarce. Buyers believed that there was a possibility of future supply sources being疏通, so they took a wait-and-see approach, seemingly expecting something. However, sellers believed that transportation obstacles might not be easily eliminated, so they remained firm and refused to loosen their grip. As a result, the market stalled and trading was scarce. Only some retail traders in this street slightly embellished the market by trading 200 bags of Wuhu yellow beans, over 100 bags of Anqing yellow beans, 80 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans, and one cart of Jiangbei green beans. The prices were not significantly different from the previous market.</p>

<p>The local raw peanut market has been in decline recently due to sharply falling production prices, abundant inventory, and sluggish sales to merchants. The market price could not be sustained. Yesterday, over 100 bags of Bengbu raw peanuts were sold at a price of 36.7 yuan to 34 yuan, a sharp drop of 10 yuan from the highest price.</p>

<p>The securities market yesterday was weak, indicating investor uncertainty. Only搶帽子 trading was relatively lively, while formal trading remained scarce. The market should have declined due to the rising gold and environmental factors, but spot prices could not be manipulated, so they rebounded slightly after falling. The establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime was not enough to stimulate the market, and most people viewed it with indifference. Therefore, fluctuations in the debt market remained very small. Yesterday's trading saw small drops as intraday long positions were liquidated. The Type C debt also broke below the 9 yuan mark, but there were no large sellers in the market. In the afternoon, short covering was more active than long liquidation, so the market price rebounded slightly, fluctuating up and down without any significant changes. As a result, the price fell slightly by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. The trading volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 12.6 yuan.</p>
<p>The 30th shareholders' meeting of the British-owned Hutchison Bank's Krao Rubber Company will be held on April 11th. At the same time, the final dividend will be distributed at 1 jiao 2 fen of national currency per share, for a total of 2 jiao 2 fen of national currency for the entire year, including the interim dividend.</p>
<p>The 1939 profit of the British-owned Kawakita Milk Co., Ltd. reached over 330,000 yuan of national currency, which, together with the accumulated balance from the previous term, totals over 399,000 yuan of national currency. After distributing a dividend of 1 yuan 5 jiao of national currency per share, totaling 60,000 yuan of national currency, and setting aside a legal reserve of 30,000 yuan of national currency, the remaining amount will be rolled into the next term.</p>

<p>The bituminous coal business, although it had developed slightly in the previous week, entered a sluggish and dull state again yesterday. As new goods arrived in succession, merchants in this street and客家 tended to wait and see. However, sellers, due to high costs, remained firm and unwilling to easily sell, resulting in quiet trading and a stalemate. The previous day, Dalongxing arrived with 2,200 tons of Karkhada block coal, which was stored in a concession warehouse. The同業 price was 230 yuan per ton for screened blocks and 220 yuan for coal dust. The warehouse charged its own freight and handling fees.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Textiles: Eastern Cloth Cornering Causes Prices to Rise; Domestic Cloth Prices Also Increase <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Due to it being the end of the month yesterday in the domestic cloth market, sales were good and hoarders were holding onto their stock, causing a lack of supply on the market. Cornering of eastern cloth caused prices to rise, and the domestic cloth market also showed strength. White fabrics, fine cloths, fine twills, and coarse cloths were in high demand among dealers. Selling prices increased by one to five jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloths also increased by one and a half to five jiao. In the afternoon, eastern cloth prices rose again. Domestic cloth quotations varied. The volume of gray fabrics traded on this street was nearly 100,000 bolts, bleached and dyed cloth over 200 pieces, Guangdong and Fujian dealers traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, Zhejiang and Jiangxi dealers traded cloth from Ewo and Lun Chang totaling over 200 pieces, Tianjin dealers traded over 50 cases of cotton cloth and bleached foreign yarn cloth, and Anhui northern ports dealers traded over 3,000 bolts of bleached and dyed cloth.</p>
<p>The rising trend of eastern cloth continued strongly. White fabrics and fine cloths rose by about one yuan per bolt both in the morning and afternoon. Fine twills rose by five jiao. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at a high price. It reached 30 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, and closed at 30 yuan and 4 jiao. Mid-range Color Ball and Trumpet brands were particularly scarce and in high demand, rising to 30 yuan and 1 jiao. Foreign firms placed orders for about 2,000 pieces of fine cloth for the next month, with Dragon Head starting at 31 yuan and reaching 31 yuan and a jiao. Mid-range brands were quoted at 30 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. Demand on this street was very strong. Four Gentlemen Serge rose to 9 jiao and 5 shi, with trading for next month opening at 9 jiao, 4 fen, and 2 li and a half. Market sentiment was extremely strong.</p>

<p>(From this newspaper dated the twelfth year of Tongzhi during the decadent Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Organizing the Book Collection</p>
<p>The Tianyi Pavilion library of the Fan family in Ningbo has long been renowned for its vast collection. However, due to the chaos of war, it has gradually deteriorated. The clan elder, Zongtai, ordered over ten descendants to check the catalog and organize the books. After three months, they had only processed less than one percent of the collection. Nevertheless, they had already borrowed over two hundred yuan from the River Works Bureau's funds. As the River Works funds come from shop and property donations, shopkeepers have enthusiastically set up donation barrels along the streets. If this property donation money were used for disaster relief in Yan, Yu, Qin, and Jin provinces, everyone would eagerly contribute. Using this money to remove manure and clean the streets, while not urgent, could still be considered a measure to prevent disease, as each person sweeps in front of their own door. However, first removing the old soil mounds from the base of the wall behind the government office has already cost considerable funds. Now, they are also removing old soil mounds in front of the government office, which seems to take at least half a year. Furthermore, using these funds to organize the Fan family's book collection? Is it appropriate to use public funds as financial support for the Fan family's descendants? The government office's informants were well aware of these complaints. They reported to the prefect, who then instructed that the work be suspended until funds could be raised. The Fan family members are said to be lamenting the on-and-off nature of the project.</p>
<p>Catching an Imp</p>
<p>Last night, a live "Imp of Impermanence" was captured on the north bank of the Ning River. Patrolmen took him to General Ge at the You Sheng Temple, who sent him to the county magistrate. Magistrate Shi immediately held court. The imp was found to be from Cixi. He and an accomplice, one dressed as the Black Imp of Impermanence and the other as the White Imp of Impermanence, painted their faces and let their hair down. They waited by the newly opened river at night for lone travelers to pass by, then jumped out and danced to scare and rob them. This had been going on for many days and they had gained quite a bit. Yesterday, they saw a woman passing by and were about to rush up, but the woman jumped into the river, fortunately surviving. Her companion informed the patrolmen, who then captured one of them. The White Imp of Impermanence's whereabouts are unknown. The magistrate ordered the captured imp to be beaten with one thousand strokes and detained for one month, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e97">On the "New Life Movement" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is a national life reform movement. It was initiated by Chairman Chiang in Nanchang in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Its purpose is to eliminate habits of our nation that are unsuitable for the times and environment, and to move towards a life that is suitable for the times and environment. In essence, it seeks to rationalize the lives of the people, using the traditional Chinese virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as guiding principles for daily life. This movement is overseen by the New Life Movement Promotion Association and has now been implemented throughout the country. The New Life Movement before the war was magnificent for a time! However, how many people could truly practice the rules of the New Life? In the isolated island of Shanghai after the war, the people have long thrown the rules of the New Life to the four winds! The enjoyment of life is extravagant and indulgent! Restaurants and dance halls are filled with singing and dancing! In the alleys and corners, the sound of mahjong tiles is deafening! Using the special environment as an excuse? To live a decadent life! As for the decline of will! The weakness of spirit! Foreigners are amazed and consider it a miracle! While brave soldiers on the front lines are risking their lives to defend the country, shedding blood! The isolated island of Shanghai, far from the embrace of the motherland, actually has such absurd phenomena? Isn't it a miracle? As for the displaced and exiled compatriots who have lost their homes! Living in shelters, their lives are disciplined. Simple food, worn-out clothes, the work and rest of the refugee production agencies are timely, and the collectivized life is disciplined and rationalized. The spirit is solemn and tense, which is truly in line with the times and the New Life. Because the refugees have suffered the cruelty of war, everyone has a common hatred of the enemy and practices a hard life! Because of this, there has never been any shameless behavior among the refugees. But the so-called intellectual class, the so-called wealthy merchants, are only concerned with petty gains, accumulating and hoarding, and do not know "propriety", or "righteousness", are corrupt and shameless, and are becoming more and more aggravated today, and cannot be saved! Confucius said: Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a country. If the four pillars are not established, the country will perish! Throughout the history of Song, there were treacherous and shameless officials above, and muddled and ignorant people below, which eventually led to the loss of the country and the mountains! The people become slaves! Can we not be afraid?</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is a movement of revitalization and revival, of being strict with oneself, restraining oneself, and reforming oneself! Everyone stands on their own post, buries themselves in their work, respects propriety, righteousness, knows integrity, shame, observes discipline, and takes responsibility. It is something that must be done in person, not only in times of national crisis, but also after the completion of the victory against resistance and the establishment of the country!</p>
<p>The New Life Movement, most of all, requires respecting one's integrity, and thinking about national disasters and family feuds at all times! Will the country be restored (liberated)? Will the family prosper? Sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, work hard and strive to achieve it, give up hobbies (such as smoking, drinking, etc.), abandon entertainment, eat coarse food, wear homespun cloth, and strive to make life militarized! Rationalize daily life! Be frugal, hardworking, and train your spirit! Read more books by ancient sages and loyal ministers, cultivate one's personality, "be unyielding in the face of power, not tempted by profit, and unwavering in poverty and humility," and be sure to follow them faithfully! As I write this, I am reminded of Boyi and Shuqi (the two sons of the ruler of Guzhu), who, because they were ashamed to eat the millet of Zhou, gathered ferns on Shouyang Mountain. Although they eventually starved to death, their personalities and spirits still have a vigorous vitality today! Truly, can the country be destroyed? But the will must not be lost! If the will is not lost, the country may not be destroyed! If the will is lost, the country will ultimately be unsavable. Practicing the rules of the New Life and eliminating the old corrupt habits is self-help and teaching the country. In other words, saving the country is saving oneself, and do not indulge in the sounds, colors, dogs, and horses, burying oneself, and being despised by foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The New Life in Guilin <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Xu</p>
<p>People are full of strength and vitality, and the city is full of order and cleanliness.</p>
<p>When Guilin is mentioned, the first thing people praise is the so-called New Life. The simplicity and strength of the people here are beyond the reach of people from other provinces. Strength has always been a characteristic of the people of Guangxi. Although their bodies appear short, they are as strong as iron. Their dark brown faces show that they have been exposed to the sun and fully absorbed ultraviolet rays. People walk upright, their whole bodies seem to be full of vitality, and they have a great and fearless spirit. In recent years, thanks to the continuous efforts of the municipal government to promote the New Life Movement, the entire city of Guilin, whether in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, or other aspects, is in line with the principles of the New Life and full of vigor.</p>
<p>The clothing of the citizens is exceptionally simple. Most of their clothing materials are local gray cloth. On the street, you can see that most people are wearing a set of gray Zhongshan suits, which are ironed so that there is not a single wrinkle, and are very neat and clean. Under their feet are a pair of not very expensive leather boots, and their hats are ordinary casual hats. In winter, they also add a dark-colored cloth coat. This is the appearance of ordinary people. As for the soldiers, they wear dark blue line cloth, not gray cloth, and this is the same from officers to soldiers. Although modern women are not completely absent here, they are indeed rare. Female students in schools are never seen wearing gorgeous clothes. Male students all wear blue uniforms, neatly dressed, and their hats are the same as military hats—no, they are militarized all over. Looking at their appearance, dark brown faces, very strong, and roughly the same as soldiers, except for the color of the uniforms. Not only is their appearance like this, but their lives are indeed militarized. You can see it in the classroom and in the dormitory. There is nothing on the bed except a mat and a quilt, and it is the same in winter and summer. Guilin City also has a special feature, that is, citizens are prohibited from perming their hair. Wearing high-heeled leather shoes is regarded as a prostitute, so ordinary citizens do not wear high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>The people of Guangdong and Guangxi are most famous for their emphasis on food hygiene. Guilin is of course no exception. Furthermore, due to the strict management of the authorities, there are special health inspectors in ordinary restaurants to check. Every summer, there is always a large-scale food hygiene movement. If food is found to contain bacteria, in addition to supervising the disinfection of the store, a fine will also be imposed as a punishment for damaging the health of citizens. In summer, the soda and ice cream sold in coffee shops are relatively hygienic. In addition, the fresh meat and fish stalls in the morning vegetable market are set up at a specified time and in a specified place.</p>
<p>Citizens have always gone to bed early and risen early. Since the implementation of the New Life, they have gotten up even earlier. After getting up, they take a walk, exercise, and take deep breaths. Many citizens are also accustomed to running in the morning. Therefore, in the morning in Guilin, there are always many people running in large strides on every street. This may be why most people in Guangxi are strong and sturdy. The houses of the citizens are short and clean. The furnishings in the houses are mostly elegant and clean. Imported goods are almost extinct. The signs of shops on the street are not as messy and scattered as in Shanghai. Under the guidance of the Health Department of the Municipal Government, citizens carry out cleaning and sweeping of their houses once every season.</p>
<p>Regarding the aspect of citizens traveling, in addition to the traffic rules issued by the police station, there are also large warning signs "Walk on the left" posted on the telephone poles all over the streets and alleys. If you are careless and walk on the right side of the street, a "traffic person" will come to correct you. It is difficult to find a rickshaw on the streets of Guilin. As for the sedan chairs used in the north, they have never been seen. This is because they are strong and hardworking and cannot bear to have people pull or carry them. When they walk, they only see them rushing forward without turning their heads, but they are strangely energetic. Residents of Guilin always walk in single file when gathering, dispersing, and buying tickets, and there is never any conflict.</p>
<p>The logo of the New Life is shield-shaped: the meaning of the shield indicates self-defense. The center of the shield is a "compass," the meaning of which indicates that life has a certain standard. The shield has four colors: red, yellow, blue, and white. Red indicates the spirit of struggle, enthusiasm, courage, and progress. Yellow indicates a bright and selfless attitude. Blue and white are the meaning of the blue sky and white sun.</p>

<h3 id="e100">The "Four Musts" Creed for Women in Xindu <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jie</p>
<p>In Xindu—Chongqing, a wartime city, our women have enthusiastically promoted and realized the "New Life Movement". How do they implement it? They have a creed of "four musts". Now I write it down below, so that women in the "isolated island" can use it as a model.</p>
<p>(1) Must Have Faith</p>
<p>They all believe that the New Life Movement is a good way to save the country, save the nation, and save themselves, and then the New Life Movement can generate power.</p>
<p>(2) Must Have the Determination to Promote It</p>
<p>They believe that everything in society is small at first and then becomes large, near at first and then becomes far. But many Chinese people make the serious mistake of being able to speak but not act, so they must get rid of this bad habit and make great determination and sacrifice to proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>(3) Must Persevere</p>
<p>They deeply feel that the Chinese people's five-minute enthusiasm has long been ridiculed by all nations. But they believe that if promoting the New Life Movement is only promoted today and forgotten tomorrow, what use is it? Therefore, the women of Xindu believe that they should use a persistent mentality to constantly encourage themselves and persuade their family members and children, so that everyone can be cautious and not forget, and constantly strive to promote it. In this way, the New Life Movement will move towards the bright road of "daily renewal, daily renewal".</p>
<p>(4) Must Extend It to Others</p>
<p>The nature of women is gentle and kind, and they are also the linchpin of the family. If they can set an example in everything and extend it to others, they can not only persuade their children with love, but also move their relatives and friends with sincerity, and set an example for their neighbors, and can also extend it to the public and move the whole country.</p>
<h3 id="e101">New Life and Tuberculosis Prevention <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The prevalence of lung disease in our country is of course due to the lack of public health and the lack of popularization of all tuberculosis prevention facilities, which is undeniable, but the reason why most patients often lead to tragic results is not due to the above reasons, but to two other major reasons: one is the patient's delay in seeking medical attention, and the other is the patient's excessive reliance on medicine.</p>
<p>Delay in seeking medical attention and reliance on drugs are common problems among general lung disease patients in our country. The reason is that they do not yet know the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, so they make one mistake after another. During this tuberculosis prevention movement, in order to reduce the tragic pain suffered by general lung diseases, we really have to strike the morning bell and beat the evening drum to wake everyone up and make everyone have a deep understanding of early diagnosis and early treatment.</p>
<p>(1) Early diagnosis, because the earlier lung disease is detected, the easier it is to treat, and the faster it is to recover and restore health. Not only can you avoid all pain, but you can also reduce infection to others, so this early diagnosis is very important for protecting personal health and social stability.</p>
<p>(2) Early treatment, lung disease is not an incurable disease, but there are no special drugs at home and abroad. The mortality rate of lung disease among Europeans and Americans has gradually decreased because they have improved specialized treatment, so that often desperate patients can also escape danger and preserve their lives, and the earlier this appropriate treatment is, the greater the hope of restoring health.</p>
<p>In this tuberculosis prevention campaign, we have two ardent hopes: one is that from now on, due to the efforts of all parties in tuberculosis prevention work, lung disease in our country can be gradually reduced, and the other is that in the future, luxury patients can reduce tragic results, but how can we truly reduce lung disease in our country? I dare to say bluntly that only by popularizing early diagnosis and eliminating the source of infection can we reduce lung disease. How can we reduce the tragic consequences for patients? I dare to say bluntly again that only early treatment can save the general patients from being trapped in a tragic fate. General patients, do not hesitate on a wrong path, and quickly look at the road to health and move forward!</p>

<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>The strength of a country's economy depends on the development of its national products. It is undeniable that the national industry of our country is immature and its products are backward. During the Former Qing Dynasty, the national goods industry never escaped the stereotype of official supervision and merchant management, and was restricted everywhere, leaving no room for free development. Since the People's Republic of China, the national goods industry has developed day by day. Although it has undergone various disturbances and setbacks, the foundation of the national industry has become more and more solid. The daily necessities of the people, which were all supplied by imports in the past, can now be made domestically, and their quality is even better than that of imports. Since August 13th, although inland transportation has been difficult, patriotic people must use domestic goods as wealth for the products they use, and they are happy to buy them even if the price is doubled. What is particularly rare is the great success of sales in Southeast Asia and the Americas. In the past year, 50-60% of the products of national goods factories were sold to Southeast Asia. Although it is due to the patriotism of overseas Chinese, it is also due to the excellent quality of the products, which are welcomed by all parties. In this case, the hard work and spirit of many national goods industrialists is not wasted, and the future of the national industry is greatly hoped for. This newspaper has been publishing a special issue on national goods for five years, advocating and promoting it with pen and reading, and it is deeply welcomed and praised by people in society. In this extraordinary period, it is necessary to urgently restore it, so it is specially continued. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Goods News (all news about the progress of the national goods industry and all the dynamics of the national goods industry, etc.)</p>
<p>(2) New National Goods Products (introduce new products and describe their advantages in detail)</p>
<p>(3) Overview of National Goods Factories (one factory per week)</p>
<p>(4) Sales of National Goods Abroad (especially focusing on Southeast Asia)</p>
<p>(5) Common Sense of Household Daily Use (with the aim of promoting national goods)</p>
<p>As mentioned on the right, this journal is willing to make a small contribution to the national goods industry with cotton strength, and deeply hopes that like-minded people in society who are enthusiastic about national goods will support and assist each other, and express their great opinions to promote the development of the national goods industry. This is the beginning of the resumption of publication, and I would like to state a few words to seek correction from all readers.</p>
<h3 id="e103">National Products in Southeast Asia <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Chen</p>
<p>National Products Sell Well in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>According to a Havas news report on the 2nd of this month: The Nanyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Development Company), run by the Japanese, will increase its capital from 20 million yen to 40 million yen this month to expand its business in Southeast Asia. After reading this news, we feel that this is a futile effort, because Southeast Asia can almost be said to be the place with the most overseas Chinese, with about 8 million people. Moreover, these overseas Chinese have a relatively high level of knowledge and a very strong sense of national consciousness. Their concern for the motherland's war of resistance does not diminish because they are far away. Therefore, the boycott of Japanese goods is extremely enthusiastic and widespread. Taking Singapore as an example, there are more than 2,000 people secretly investigating whether overseas Chinese are buying Japanese goods. Those who violate the rules are first warned, and then fined to donate to national salvation funds. If they sell Japanese goods, their ears are often cut off. In fact, overseas Chinese are all patriotic, and with this method of mutual encouragement, no matter how much capital the Japanese increase, Japanese goods will not be able to rise. At the same time, the overseas Chinese are eager to be patriotic, so national products sell especially well in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Population and Land of Southeast Asia</p>
<p>The Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippine Islands, Vietnam, Siam, Burma, etc., are collectively referred to as Southeast Asia. The area of ​​the land is estimated to be more than 3.8 million square kilometers, and the population is estimated to be more than 10.57 million. The products are coffee, tea, cocoa, coconut, rice, etc. The commercial port is Singapore, which can be reached in ten days from Shanghai. There are many postal ships of various countries coming and going, and the commerce can almost be said to be controlled by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Procedures for Shipping to Southeast Asia</p>
<p>In one month of November last year, national products transferred to Southeast Asia and Batou Sumatra for sale reached 50 million yuan, breaking the record for national products sold abroad; this shows that the sale of national products to Southeast Asia is not affected by the war of resistance. The national products sold in Southeast Asia are mainly light industrial products and agricultural products, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, silk, paper umbrellas, cigarettes, soap, matches, ham, vermicelli, MSG, medicinal materials, leather, etc. In September of the 7th year of the Republic of China, one of the articles in the National Product Certification Regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated: "Any industrial product manufactured by the people of the Republic of China, with excellent quality and conforming to the provisional national product standards, may directly apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, or be transferred by the local competent authority to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the issuance of a national product certificate..." Article 7 states: "Any industrial product with a national product certificate may apply for a national product industrial export certificate when exported abroad, but it must be certified by the original factory that it is indeed a product of the factory. The commodity inspection bureau or inspection branch of the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall be the competent authority for issuing the aforementioned export certificate. In places where no inspection bureau or inspection branch is established, the customs supervisor shall sign the certificate, and if there is no supervisor, the tax commissioner shall sign on behalf of the supervisor." Article 8 states: "Anyone applying for a national product industrial export certificate shall first obtain an application form from the nearest competent authority, fill it out item by item, and submit the bill of lading, invoice, and certificate issued by the original factory of the goods for inspection, together with the certificate fee, for verification and issuance. The aforementioned export certificate shall be applied for one certificate for each distribution location, regardless of whether the industrial product is one or more types, and the certificate fee shall be 2 yuan in national currency per certificate." Article 9 states: "The competent authority for issuing the export certificate mentioned in the preceding article shall, if there is no false information in the application form and attachments, issue a national product industrial export certificate according to the filled-in application form." and so on. This is because after the war of resistance, the situation is different. Some places are temporarily submerged, and some places are also controlled. Fearing that inferior goods will be mixed into national products, those who have previously obtained a national product certificate from the former Ministry of Industry must re-apply for a national product certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to show seriousness. Moreover, after every six months, a report form should be made, because there are often changes in various places during the war, which cannot be permanently applied. At the same time, a national product certificate list should be obtained from the Chamber of Commerce for each batch of goods transported. If we transport it to Southeast Asia, it will be regarded as enemy goods, and the loss will be small. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce temporarily issues the National Product Certificate List, one of which states: (Any industrial product manufactured by the national factories in the Shanghai urban area that have obtained the National Product Certificate of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and wish to sell it abroad or in various ports in China may apply to the Association for a National Product Certificate List in accordance with these measures. The scope of the Shanghai urban area is temporarily limited to the safe area within the two special zones, and it will be determined at any time according to the actual situation. Article 3 states: Any industrial product that has not yet obtained the National Product Certificate of the Ministry of Economic Affairs may also apply to the Association for a National Product Certificate List in accordance with these measures due to the urgency of transportation and sales, but from the date of obtaining the List, it shall apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a National Product Certificate in accordance with the regulations within two months. Other detailed procedures can be inquired at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.)</p>
<p>Points to Note for National Product Merchants</p>
<p>Since national products sell well in Southeast Asia, and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are happy to use national products because of their patriotism, our national product manufacturers and farmers must always be more motivated to avoid disappointing overseas compatriots. Based on what I have seen, there are several points that should be reflected upon:</p>
<p>(1) Is the quality of the goods excellent? Shoddy products are easy to cause resentment.</p>
<p>(2) Is the price self-restrained? Although the interest is low, if you can sell more, you can make more profit.</p>
<p>(3) Is the delivery on time? If the goods cannot be delivered on time when an order is placed, it often causes many difficulties for the other party, resulting in a loss of credibility.</p>
<p>(4) Is the packaging solid? If the decoration is not exquisite, it will lose its beauty, and if it is not solid, it will be easy to break and decay when traveling across the ocean.</p>

<p>— Pu Chang</p>
<p>The socks for a family, young and old, are quite expensive when calculated at the current prices. Therefore, smart people do not allow any slack in even the smallest parts. According to my experience, only Shenyu brand hemp socks are the most affordable (produced by Shanghai Renyu Machine Knitting Factory). Although I am a very clumsy person and not worthy of being called a smart person, and even less like a specialized person who can analyze the texture and explain the reasons, my experience and facts tell me very clearly. At the same time, friends who have worn Shenyu brand hemp socks have said the same. The most obvious feature of Shenyu brand hemp socks is that the texture is thin, uniform, and clean. When worn on the feet, they are refreshing and smooth, looking almost like silk socks. They are comfortable and fit everywhere. After many washes and sun exposure, the color is still like new, and they do not lint at all. They are certainly stronger than silk socks and even stronger than ordinary hemp socks. You who have always worn silk socks may also want to try them. The price of hemp socks is much cheaper than silk socks after all. Past history</p>

<h3 id="e107">General Situation of Merlin Canned Food Factory Excellent and Hygienic Products Can Be Called Formidable Rivals of Imported Goods Sells Well in the UK, US, and Southeast Asia Truly Wins Glory for National Products <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Wangshu</p>
<p>Past History</p>
<p>Merlin Canned Food Company was founded in the 22nd year of the Republic of China with a capital of 50,000 yuan. It increased to 100,000 yuan in the 23rd year, 150,000 yuan in the 26th year, 200,000 yuan in the 27th year, and 400,000 yuan in the 28th year. The total annual turnover has also increased from 70,000 yuan to more than 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The current chairman is Mr. Dou Yaoting, the manager is Mr. Tu Kaitai, the factory director is Mr. Chen Runshui, and the engineer is Mr. Ikhler from Europe. The outline of its manufacturing and sales is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The types of products are divided into fruit jam, soy sauce, baking powder, vegetables, fish and meat, chicken and duck, and fruit. There are many detailed items, which cannot be listed in detail.</p>
<p>(2) The main markets for sales before the war were Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin, including Nanjing and Hankou, which accounted for an equal proportion. Only 15% were sold abroad. After the war, the Yangtze River basin market was naturally lost, but new avenues have been established to replace it, namely, promoting sales to the Southeast Asian islands and increasing exports to the United Kingdom and the United States. Before the war, exports to the UK and the US accounted for about 10% of the total turnover, but now they have increased to 25%. Exports to Southeast Asia also account for 25%. There are many reasons for this good performance, but the excellent quality and hygiene of Merlin products are the main reasons. Regarding sales in this city, most of them are Western restaurants and food merchants, and the sales volume accounts for half of the total. Recently, the sales of products have been booming, and there is a trend of demand exceeding supply. Although the selling price has risen slightly due to the sharp increase in costs, it is still three times cheaper than imported goods.</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturing Procedures The following is a description of the manufacturing process of green beans, one of its main products: 1. Material Procurement: Green beans are originally a Western variety. Merlin ships bean seeds from France and distributes them to nearby rural farmers, and purchases them from them during harvest. 2. Shelling: After being transported to the factory, the bean shells are removed by machine (bottom picture). 3. Classification: The beans are classified manually according to size. 4. Cleaning: The beans are washed with water. 5. Cooking. 6. Cleaning: Washed again. 7. Canning (top picture): The cans are filled by machine, and the weight of each can is equal. There is no air in the can, so it can be stored for a long time. 8. Steaming: Placed in a steam pot for disinfection. Statistically, it takes only one and a half to two hours from the transportation of raw materials to the canning, which cannot be said to be very fast.</p>

<h3 id="e108">How to Use Spring Break? <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>As usual, the schools in this city will have a seven-day spring break starting from April 1st. Now let me talk about the meaning of spring break: Every day, we bury ourselves in our books, and we inevitably feel tired in our minds. Therefore, we want to take advantage of this warm spring weather to adjust our body and mind. This is originally a good meaning. Therefore, during each year's spring break, many children gather a few classmates for a trip; and many other children follow their parents on the occasion of returning to their hometown to sweep the tombs, staying in their hometown for a few days. But I know that there are also not a few children who waste this spring break arbitrarily; in other words, the school gives them seven days of vacation, and every day they just wander the streets and mess around with naughty children, and even spend every day in theaters or game venues; spending the spring break in this way completely loses the meaning of the school's spring break. After reading this article, I hope to correct it if there is, and encourage it if there is not, especially at this time, it is impossible to take a hike or travel, or to return to the province with parents; therefore, it is easier to embark on this wrong path.</p>
<p>Since hiking trips and the like are impossible, does that mean that we have no opportunity to appreciate nature or find some extra-curricular knowledge during this year's spring break? This concise conclusion is completely wrong. The following two methods can give a satisfactory answer to this question.</p>
<p>1. You can go to the local public library or museum, etc.; during school hours, you do not have enough time to observe in detail, but during the spring break, you can. Other things, such as reading newspapers, can also be done carefully because there is more free time during the holidays. Can't these help you acquire extra-curricular knowledge?</p>
<p>2. To appreciate nature, the several parks in this city, such as Zhaofeng Park, etc., cannot be said to be insufficient. In the same way, you can also invite a few friends, just like going on a hike or trip in the past, bring a ball, and play on the grass. When you are tired of playing, sit on the grass and eat some refreshments; after eating, you can bring your books and hold an on-the-spot sketching competition. This method is sure to be happily implemented by everyone.</p>
<p>Children, finally, I hope that you will not be immersed in joy every day during this spring break, and you should also find some time every day to review your homework. When it is raining and you cannot go out, you may invite a few classmates to your home to hold some calligraphy competitions, arithmetic games, etc.</p>
<p>How to use spring break? According to the above methods, you will no longer feel meaningless or uninterested.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Flying a Kite is a Beneficial Game <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>"Clothes are wet with apricot blossom rain, faces are blown by gentle willow wind." In this sunny and breezy season, it is the perfect time to enjoy ourselves. As for enjoyment, it is very complicated, but we should seek what is noble and beneficial to our body and mind. Only the game of flying kites is the best. Dear children, your school is about to have spring break. During this holiday, you may take some time out from your studies to try flying kites. That is much better than other useless games.</p>
<p>Kites are also known as paper eagles. According to the story in Duyi Zhi: "When Hou Wei surrounded the city, Jian Wen made paper eagles and flew them into the sky to send an emergency message to the outside." Zouchu Lu also records: "Li Ye of the Five Dynasties made paper eagles in the palace, and used a thread to ride the wind as a play. Later, he used bamboo as a flute on the head of the eagle, so that the wind entered the bamboo and the sound was like a zheng, so it was named a kite." From this, we can know that the manufacturing of kites is very early, but recent kites do not tie bamboo as a flute, but are still called kites. The method of making them has many types, such as figures, fish, birds, etc. When they are released by the wind, they are lifelike. If you fly a kite at night, you can also tie a small lantern on it, commonly known as a lantern kite. When the lights are lit, it seems to be competing with the stars in the sky, which is very spectacular.</p>
<p>On a sunny day with a gentle breeze, it is very happy for children to invite their companions to fly kites. At the same time, because they have to pull the kite up, they have to keep winding and unwinding the thread with their hands, and their feet have to run. Since the hands and feet are in motion, all parts of the body are also active at the same time, exercising the body, strengthening the muscles and bones, and improving health a lot. Moreover, in the shape, it arouses the lofty will and supreme tendency of children, and embodies a sense of enterprising in the game. Therefore, this kind of entertainment is very desirable. However, it is not easy for children who live on isolated islands to find a square to fly kites. Then it is better to hold it on the school grounds or playground.</p>

<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Today is Sunday again. It has been a bit spring-like these days, and it is getting light especially early. When the clock struck seven, everyone in Ah Hui's family got out of bed, but today the bell rang eight times, and Ah Hui was still lying in bed. On weekdays, he had already gone to school to attend classes. His mother had urged him several times, and he slowly got up from the bed, muttering, "Today is a holiday, there is nothing to do after getting up, why not sleep a little longer." These three sentences were heard by Ah Ming, and he shouted loudly outside: "Brother! Come quickly! There is something fun here! Come and see!" He thought that perhaps this could speed up his brother's movements. The lazy Ah Hui was so shouted by his brother that he quickly put his clothes on, without even buttoning them, dragged his shoes, and ran out of the room with sleepy eyes, saying in his mouth: "Where? Where?" Who knew that on the table were placed two cups of the same size and depth, filled with water, and a piece of wood floating in one cup. Ah Hui was so angry.</p>
<p>"Is this supposed to be fun! You lied to me!" Ah Hui complained to his brother with a resentful tone.</p>
<p>"Don't be angry, you should know that there is a fun trick in these two cups. Let me ask you first: Which of these two cups is heavier?" Ah Ming asked him with a smile.</p>
<p>Ah Hui thought carefully: two cups of the same size, filled with the same water, and a piece of wood floating in one cup. He asked, "Of course, the cup with the wood floating in it is heavier." After he finished speaking, he turned around to wash his face.</p>
<p>"Don't go, you should know that in fact it is not what you imagined. The weight of the two cups is the same." Ah Ming knew that his brother would not guess correctly.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it." "Okay, I can try it for you right away." He went to find a basket and a scale. He carefully weighed the basket, then put the cup in the basket and weighed it again, being very careful not to spill the water in the cup. Then he weighed the cup with the wood in it again, and the result was not what Ah Hui said. Ah Hui was of course defeated, but even though he didn't guess right, he wanted to know why he didn't guess right? And Ah Ming was also willing to tell him:</p>
<p>"These two cups were originally the same weight, and the water inside was also the same weight. But one of them has a piece of wood floating in it. According to ordinary people's eyes, of course, they would think that the one with the wood is heavier. You should know that in a cup filled with water, how can you put a piece of wood in it? For example, in a basket full of apples, it is so full that it cannot be fuller. If you put another pear in it; when you let go of your hand, the pear will fall to the side of the basket, unless you take an apple away and then put the pear in. This is the same principle. When the wood is put down, some water has to be squeezed out, and the amount of water is less than the amount of water in the cup without wood, but the most interesting thing is that the amount of water squeezed out is exactly equal to the weight of the wood. Therefore, although the contents of these two cups are different, the weight is the same." How did you know that the amount of water squeezed out is equal to the weight of the wood? Ah Hui asked his brother.</p>
<p>"This is based on the principle invented by the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes, and other scientists have proved that his principle is correct. Even now, it is still correct. That principle is: all floating objects (such as wood, cork, etc.) because they are contained in a container (such as a cup), and the weight of the liquid (such as water) discharged is equal to the weight of the object itself." Speaking of this, the voice of his mother calling Ah Hui to wash his face interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p>Yan Shaohua, a 14-year-old elementary school student</p>
<p>Dear merchants who hoard rice, grain, coal briquettes, etc.:</p>
<p>Please forgive my rudeness in suddenly writing this letter. I have no other intentions. All I want to ask is this sentence: "Do you have a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer?" Please answer me!</p>
<p>"Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer." This sentence comes from Mencius. At that time, it was a time of mutual wars between the states, with corpses all over the fields and blood flowing into ditches. Of course, Mencius, as the second sage of China, could not bear to see such a situation, so he said this!</p>
<p>However, today's China, especially Shanghai, is no less than it was at that time; although the war has shifted to the west, how many refugees have increased in the concessions, and how many beggars have frozen to death on the streets?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about that for now, but what is the matter with the recent surge in rice, grain, and coal briquettes? Please answer me!</p>
<p>The fat of the poor has been squeezed out to fill your pockets, which has become an indelible fact; is your heart as black as coal briquettes?</p>
<p>How many people have felt difficulty because of the skyrocketing rice prices, and even committed suicide, jumping into the Huangpu River...</p>
<p>Please reflect on it, what would you do if you encountered this situation?</p>
<p>Since Mencius said, "Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer," then please take out your "heart that cannot bear to see others suffer." But I don't know if you have a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer? My words are finished here, and what I earnestly desire is: I respectfully hope that you will release your conscience!</p>

<p>At that time, a blue lightning bolt rose from the east, looking like a knife. It swept across the sky three times and then dimmed. The sun was setting in the west, descending to the horizon like a blood-red ball.</p>
<p>The surging sound of the Golden River went straight to Hans's ears. He stood on the edge of the gap where the waterfall was pouring down, looking down. The water reflected the blood-red sunset, looking like flames, spitting out endlessly there. The sound of the water grew louder and louder, like thunder, making his head dizzy. He trembled, untied the water bottle from his belt, and threw it into the rapids. He suddenly felt a chill that went straight through his limbs. He struggled for a while, then shouted loudly and fell down. The sound of the water drowned out his shout. The surging water rushed over a "black stone."</p>
<p>Poor Little Geller had been guarding in the house, waiting for Hans to return, waiting anxiously. Who knew that he wouldn't come no matter how long he waited, which made him panic. He immediately went to the prison to inform Hihua of everything that had happened. Hihua was so happy when he heard the news, saying that Hans must have become a black stone this time, so the gold in the Golden River could belong to him alone. However, Little Geller always felt very sad in his heart, crying all night long. The next morning, after he got up, he saw that there was no bread or money in the house, so he went to another goldsmith to work, working hard every day and with excellent results, so he soon accumulated a sum of money, enough to pay Hihua's fine. So he went to the prison and gave all the money to Hihua. Hihua was immediately freed and safely left the prison. Hihua was very happy, thinking that the gold in the Golden River would soon be in his hands, but Little Geller begged him bitterly to find Hans, at least to know his whereabouts.</p>

<p>What is sin? The Bible gives us many answers. The most common names are "lost path," "transgression against God," "debt," "sickness," "bondage," "arbitrary." We do not assume that the ideal of sin is unique to Christians. Christian conscience has a special feeling about sin, but this ideal of sin is the most universal. We find it in historical records; ancient Egypt, Silver Africa, Mexico, all had many kinds of sacrifices; rites of atonement are a major source of Greek poets' dramas, Iphigenia, Ares, and Antigone's novels. Reading Socrates' works, we know that he also expressed tacit approval for the things that warned him against doing evil and reminded him to do good. Plato's "Last Judgment" also came from this. The Roman poet Ovid admitted, "I see the better things and approve of them, but I follow the worse." At that time, Hales, Julian, and others all believed that the disasters of the country were directly caused by the sins of their people. Those who disobey God are punished with their whole family. Like Achan and his family's cattle and sheep, they were all killed. The result of sin not only affects the families of offenders but also affects their descendants. When evil is committed, later generations are guilty because of it. The people of Israel and Judah suffered many punishments because of the sins of their kings. God's law lost much of its effect because people practiced superficial rituals, because religion developed the greatest danger, like the Pharisees who quibbled over words, adhered to the letter of the law, and did not follow the spirit of the law. The Hebrew prophets rose up to say, "Does God not delight in obedience more than in sacrifice?" "O man, God has shown you what is good; what does he require of you but to do justice, love kindness, be humble, and walk with God?" Sin caused the Son of God to die. We must not take this lightly. To take it lightly is to blaspheme the way of the cross of God, because people have mutual relations, and those who have not sinned cannot avoid being punished with those who have sinned. "No one lives for himself, and no one dies for himself." Many people in the world now realize that the source of all troubles is sin, and the only power to subdue this sin is the gospel of Christ Jesus. All good people bear their sins and acknowledge them, just as Paul confessed himself to be the chief of sinners. When we read the biographies of those loyal masters, we know that we all have the same idea, that is, we feel that no matter how hard we try in our lives, we still offend God in thought, word, and deed. "What we ought to do, we have not done." This is a common sin we commit. I live my life comfortably, but I have forgotten many of my duties. Today, we claim to be faithful disciples of the Lord, but at the end of the day, I am afraid that many will not be able to answer these questions: "Have you sacrificed to preach the gospel to the Gentiles? How have you tried to save your fellow sinners?" "What examples have you set for drunkards, gamblers, and prostitutes? Have you often truly prayed, examined yourselves, and repented? Have you set aside a few percent of your income for the Lord?" When we think of these questions, if we are truly honest people, we must admit that we have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. I hope we will repent as soon as possible, for it will be too late when the night comes. If you want to study in detail, 1227</p>

<p>—Two Thoughts Expressed Before Leaving</p>
<p>Li Yanxiu stopped performing at the Gengxin Theater, and stayed for more than 20 days while waiting for the ship schedule, until yesterday when she took the Shuntian round north. The ship departed at half past twelve in the afternoon. She boarded the ship with her parents at eleven o'clock in the morning. Many people came to see her off. Although she expressed her farewell to her friends in Shanghai, she was very happy to return to her home that she always missed. She thanked all her friends who came to see her off with a smile. Before getting off the ship, the reporter had a brief conversation with her. She said two thoughts: (1) Shanghai is better than Beiping, because there is no flying sand here, the population is large, and there are things here that are not in the north, such as double-decker buses. (2) It is more difficult to sing operas in Shanghai than in Beiping, because the standard of Shanghai audiences has improved, and they pay very close attention to old operas. On the contrary, Beiping is changing its customs and gradually welcoming new operas. Moreover, there are many local dialects in the words recited on the stage that Shanghainese do not understand. For example, a very interesting sentence cannot arouse the audience's interest, which will make the performers feel bored. Talking about the truth, the wheel was about to untie the cable, and the reporter said goodbye and came out.</p>

<p>Ye Qiuxin, a mother of two children, left the Tianyunlou Xinliu Troupe and stayed at home to fulfill her responsibilities as a virtuous mother and good wife. She had no activities. Recently, the Kuide Troupe stopped performing at the Royal Palace Grand Theater and returned to Tianjin yesterday. Zhao Zhongsan, the leader of the troupe, talked to Ye Qiuxin and settled the matter. When the Kuide Troupe performs in Tianjin, she will be hired to join the stage and given a script for a new play, "Happy Enemies," which will probably be performed when she takes the stage. Qiuxin is scheduled to leave around the 17th of next month. Perhaps Qiu Yunyan, a Kun actress who is seeking further studies in the north, will travel with Qiuxin, but Qiu Yunyan is going to Beiping. According to her, she does not plan to form a team to perform immediately after arriving in Beiping. She wants to bury herself in hard work, first strive to study drama, and then seek a greater future. Someone invited Qiuxin to cooperate the day before yesterday, but she had already joined the Kuide Troupe, so it did not happen.</p>

After Glenda George paid the fine for him, he cooperated with Humphrey Bogart, who was selling smuggled alcohol, disregarding the law and acting recklessly. He also received help from Jeffry Lynn, a graduate of law school. From this story, we can see the playwright's dissatisfaction with the current society. Although James Cagney finally upheld justice and shot Humphrey Bogart, in fact, he did it for Patricia Lane.</p>
<p>The director's handling is very excellent. (1) Tense and vivid. For example, the fight between Paul Kelly and James Cagney at a nightclub in Hunter? James shooting Humphrey Bogart, etc. (2) Delicate. Introducing the appearance of James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Jeffry Lynn; James returning home after the war; and the love between Jeffry Lynn and Patricia Lane, etc. (3) All are exquisite and lovely. Rich in emotions. The scenes of James boxing Jeffry Lynn; James in a bar after bankruptcy; and dying on the steps of the church after being shot are all touching. (4) The process is concise and beautiful. For example, the carnival scenes after the end of the alcohol ban, and the collapse of the building and the citizens' close-ups when James went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Among the actors, except for Jeffry Lynn's role, which is weaker, the rest are very hardworking.</p>
<p>Entertainment News (1) Cartoonist Jiang Dongliang, in addition to his recent paintings, is also engaged in publishing. The first shot is to publish "Silver Song New Score", the first volume will be published soon, including six interludes from the latest national films, namely "Fragrant Concubine", "Loyalty Forever", "Yan Xi Jiao", "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo", etc. (2) "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" will start screening priority shows from the evening of April 10th. All purchasers of priority show tickets, regardless of upstairs or downstairs, will receive a Zhang Cuihong original bottom photo, but limited to 10,000 photos. The tickets will be on sale at Huguang starting on April 1st.</p>

<p>— Xiuyan Drawing</p>
<p>(3) Fate in Tears and Laughter</p>
<p>Everyone is already familiar with the plot of Fate in Tears and Laughter.</p>
<p>"Fan Jiashu is a young man studying in a university. He is a guest in Beiping and falls in love with a female storyteller singing drum ballads - Shen Fengxi.

Shoufeng's daughter, Xiugu, is also in love with Jiashu. The whole story revolves around this multi-angle love story."</p>
<p>It is not easy to please everyone by adapting a recent novel into a ballad and broadcasting it through orchestras, but Fate in Tears and Laughter is successful.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Young Hero Xia Cungu <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Adapted into a Children's Historical Drama</p>
<p>After "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," Wei Ruhui immediately began writing "Zheng Chenggong," which is connected to "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," but at the same time, he also wrote a three-act children's historical drama "Xia Cungu." According to Wei Ruhui, Xia Cungu was a young hero in the late Ming Dynasty. He was from Songjiang, had great ambitions, and joined the army at the age of fifteen. He followed Mr. Chen Zilong in launching an uprising in Taihu Lake and had many heroic battles. At the age of seventeen, he was captured by the Qing army and martyred in Nanjing. Although it was only a short two-year struggle, there were many moving materials that could inspire the youth's loyalty and patriotism.</p>
