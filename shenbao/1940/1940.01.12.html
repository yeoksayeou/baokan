<p>社評</p>
<h3>伏利斯氏之主張</h3>
<p>昨日報載華盛頓電訉，美國衆議員民主黨伏利斯氏發表對於遠東問題之意見；主張「美國日本與其他各國駐在中國境內之軍隊，相約全部撤退；俾華人自行處理一切，而不受他國干涉，蓋此爲遠東各種困難之合理解決；」伏氏言外之意，自信此種主張乃爲對於遠東局勢之灼見眞知，具有建設性；故並擬於日內與美國當局交換意見云。夫國際而蘄求長治久安歟？糾紛而終得根據常情常理以消弭歟？則吾人深信伏氏之主張，必爲各方所採納；抑居今日而爲遠東謀排難解紛之道，亦以促使伏氏主張之實現，爲最簡單而合理之途徑。竊願就伏氏主張，更加申論。</p>
<p>各國駐兵中國，根據條的，顧十九世紀之遺跡也。中國始終尊重條的，故明知境內留駐外兵之不合理，而未嘗要求各國撒兵；各國之在華權利，亦以中國尊重條約爲最妥善之保障，絕非依恃駐兵爲保障；是以中國與各國之關係言之，根本無復駐兵之必要。至於條約以外之軍隊，其性質，其行動，以侵略爲唯一註解；中國對於侵略軍隊，於其進攻則必抗戰，於其靜止則必驅除，於是而必然形成戰爭狀態；結束戰爭，非侵略軍隊敗潰即撤退耳；是以事實言之，至少以撒兵爲必然之歸宿。若以侵略軍隊而企圖取得條約之根據，繼續留駐中國疆界之內，此爲中國人民與政府所絕對不能接受之條約；申言之，此種企圖之不可能，亦猶使二十世紀回復至十九世紀，同其不可能。若侵略者而謂條的非駐兵不可，則無異謂非侵略不可，非繼續戰爭不可；夫抗戰原爲中國所不辭，然而離侵略者希望之解決糾紛則遠矣！</p>
<p>伏氏希望日人之不漠視其建議，吾人斷言於日本侵略之終必失敗，故終必不能漠視伏氏建議，然非所語於今日。今日者，日人意識正在瞀亂之中，行動正在乖張之中，意識行動正在矛盾之中。故對中國，標榜道義而掠奪不已，希冀和平而戰爭不已，勢窮力竭而野心不已；對國際，英美德蘇，不知所從，而對美國之且啼且笑且怨且媚，又不知所可；在國內，有近日性質混亂之政潮。如此日本，而伏氏希望之以不漠視其建議，將何殊於期待瘋人接受理智？抑伏氏亦嘗診斷症象乎？誠使於其人之初瘋，投以鎭定劑，則可望即歸寗靜；於其初瘋而絕其飲食，則可望及早就範；不幸當初之國際，不但不以條約與正義使以寗靜，且以禮貌助長其氣燄，以軍火及原料助長其力量，遂久瘋以迄於今。今則瘋且憊矣，爲今之計，應如何由外交與經濟種種方面，發動有效之制裁，以削弱其瘋在力量，束縛其瘋在行爲，由是而促彼理智之恢復。竊意如伏氏所主張者，乃爲日本理智恢復後之解決遠東糾紛之條件也；促彼恢復理智，必先由美國國會在外交經濟上有所發動；伏氏其不河漢斯言乎？</p>
<h3>美前國務卿史汀生主張　禁止軍火原料輸日　對中日戰爭主張美應拒絕調停　美國會議員多數傾向對日制裁　華各大學籲請美國勿助長侵略</h3>
<p>紐約　美國前國務卿史汀生今日致函紐約時報稱、爲使日本認識美國對日之眞實情感計、主張立法禁止軍火·彈藥以及可供作戰之一切原料、輸往日本、「蓋唯如是始能示天下以我人對於正當國際關係之重視、尤其對於條約遵守及中國土地完整主權獨立之重視、同時更可使日人了知我人之主張、固絕非兒戲者、」據史汀生言、美國商人將礦苗廢鐵、廢鋼煤油等物供給日本、於此三年之中、雖比較上爲少數、美國務院對於此項物件、欲施以精神上之禁售、亦屬可能、唯欲使日本了知美國人民對於此一問題所持之情感、則似應由國會立法、俾日本了知美國人民對於此一問題之眞態度、美國此種表示、將來必能使日本之軍閥、放棄其現有之政策、設日本此種政策不改變、則東亞之均勢、美國所極關切之均勢、現正受日本威脅之均勢、必致無法穩定矣、史氏並稱、美國此種政策可以强固軍火禁運廢止以來之優良效果、同時更可顯示美國人民「固有嚴別是非之勇氣者、」史氏繼稱、美國此項立法案、決不致導成戰爭、蓋「對美作戰、爲日本政府所最不願爲者、」此觀於美國將美日商的宜吿廢止、並未引起事端、可爲明證、史氏又謂、「現時頗有若干方面、盼望美國出而調解中日戰爭、但此種方面、若尋求共綫索、顯爲日本」、又謂、美國在遠東方面所關切者並非僅爲目前狹隘之商業利益、而盼望中日兩國以至蘇聯皆能各相獨立、各不呑噬、至於最近日本之武力、已轉趨疲弱、而中國方面則自信愈堅、故渠請美人對於日方請美出而調解一層必須嚴予拒絕、「蓋余深信此項調解工作不獨非失敗不可、並將使美國失信於中國、信譽掃地於遠東、蓋此舉將使半世紀來美國在遠東方面所竭力支持之原則、爲之完全放棄也、最後、美國在整個遠東區域中之利益、皆將遭受嚴重之打擊也」、（十一日合衆電）</p>
<p>紐約　前任國務卿史汀生致函紐約泰晤士報、主張禁止軍火與各種原料品運往日本之後、該報頃爲文加以評論、略謂、吾人相信美國人民絕大多數、均與史汀生君抱有同感、質言之、即日本未經挑釁而以侵略行動加諸中國一項事實、極爲明顯、且日本所採用之戰術、異常粗暴、其目標顯在掠奪中國土地、征服中國民族、抑吾人以爲美國在單獨禁止某種貨物、如汽油鐵礦砂諸物運往日本之前、務當向其他各國政府有所接洽、俾可諗知各該國對於斷絕日本接濟一事、究可與美國合作至何種程度、緣美國禁止各種貨物運往日本之後、日本黷武主義者是否改向共他市塲取給各種物品、以及華府九國公約共他各簽字國、對於保全中國領土完整一事、是否願在精神上贊助美國、以上兩層吾人必須有以知之故也、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英德海軍雜談</h3>
<p>英國海軍現有戰鬥艦十一艘，戰鬥巡洋艦三艘，重巡洋艦十三艘，輕巡洋艦四十八艘，航空母艦六艘，驅逐艦二百十五艘，潛水艇五十六艘，共他艦艇三百八十六艘，總共七百三十八艘，其第一種任務在於保護英國不被敵軍侵犯，第二種任務在於封鎖德國，第三種任務在於對付德國軍艦和潛艇的襲擊，保護英國的海洋航業。</p>
<p>自一六五二年以還，英國海軍沒有戰敗過一次，該國歷來的海軍名將，如霍金斯，特萊克，勃萊克，賀威，至今仍爲該國各個海軍軍官所憧憬，打敗拿破崙的納爾遜名將，允被尊之如神聖。英國海軍軍官熟悉海洋，習於航海術，遠非世界任何國海軍軍官所能望共項背，此乃數百年專心訓練所致。英國海軍軍官均係終身職，訓練嚴格，側重書本學識，不重創造能力，此即所謂「達德茅斯制」，達德茅斯乃英國訓練海軍軍官的唯一學校，每年選拔十三歲學員四十五名。每個學員的父母均須保證其子弟以海軍爲終身職業，如有半途而廢的，須繳納重大罰金，每個後補學員的牙齒如有七枚缺少，或無法修袖，患遺尿暗疾，或是太肥胖，就不及格。學習的功課有算學，科學，工程學，法文，英文，歷史，地理，每星期且須讀聖經，學習航海術各兩小時。每日七時起身，須住宿在達德茅斯三年八個月，直至二十歲仍是學員待遇。英國海軍上校級以上各軍官約四分之三，都是達德茅斯出身。現在稍有變更，海軍部每年已改向各公學選拔十七歲學生一百名爲學員，但是海軍軍官學校的保守性仍舊是保存着。</p>
<p>英國海軍所當應付的問題和別國不同。共他各國的海軍祗須保護一國，英國海軍差不多要保護半個地球。它的軍艦又不能遠離軍港。英國海軍的戰略因注意在風雲險惡的區域集中多數軍艦，以資應付。英國軍艦的搆造是準備開往世界任他處作戰的，每艦的戰鬥力雖不及任何國，却常是以多勝人。</p>
<p>英國的一般政策常以經濟爲主，平時不願輕易加重人民的負担，擴充海陸軍以壯國家的觀瞻。直至一九三五年，義大利併呑阿比西尼亞之後，始乃驚醒起來，趕造軍艦。現在建造中的祗少有航空母艦五艘，驅逐艦輕快巡洋艦數百艘，戰鬥艦九艘，共中三萬五千噸的五艘，四萬噸的四艘，各配備十四英寸十六英寸口徑的大砲，此外尙有戰鬥艦兩艘亦已定造了。</p>
<p>至以德國軍艦而論，歷來均以游擊戰爲目標，在上次歐戰中，曾擊沉英國軍艦二百四十六艘，輔助艦八百十五艘，商船被擊沉的平均每月有六十艘（二十五萬噸）之多。當時最有名的是輕巡洋艦愛姆登號，曾奉故上將斯比之命，在印度洋方面襲擊英國商業，極爲得手，英國航業，尤共是在孟加拉灣方面，殆已全部停頓。此外，在上次歐戰時，該國武裝貨船仍以商船模樣襲擊協約各國航業的大約有十艘。完成任務安然回國的僅有兩艘，共中有名的一艘是「胡爾夫」號，係在一九一六年自基爾軍港溜出，在大西洋，印度洋，太平洋一帶出沒十五個月之久，協約各國軍艦無如之何，實爲近代史上最神秘莫測的冒險情事。這次歐戰，德國仍以同樣的戰略對付英法優勢的海軍，不過此種海上游擊戰最大的問題即爲燃料和糊食的接濟。德國海軍當局對於此事定必有精密的佈置，但究能支持多久，尙待事實爲之證明、美國Life及Reader＇s　Digest兩雜誌英國艦隊一斑</p>

<p>汕頭通信、自上月下旬起、日軍調集盤踞粤省之衆、以全力北犯韶關、戰爭甚烈、茲紀戰况如下、</p>
<p>日軍三路前進形勢</p>
<p>日軍右翼、由增城北犯者、沿增江山岳地帶、人數約　萬以上、此路日軍番號、爲根本·堀川·窪·中溝·田村·小山·等大隊、該處華軍由龍門新豐迎擊、但日機瘋在濫炸、華軍迫得後撒、二十八日、日軍續向西北進、惟後方已被我軍牽住、攔腰痛擊、日軍左翼、沿粤漢鐵路北犯者、在北江左岸、有松野尾·中野·正木·林·池田·大橋·佐佐木·生田·由谷·川口·各部隊、人數的三萬、來勢非常兇猛、大砲集中發彈、替代步槍開戰、二十八日天未明、用大砲掩護渡江、每小時發彈　二千響、佐佐木·鍋島·野口·松木·四天隊（每隊一千二百餘名）當渡過琶注口之北江右岸、向呂田圩進攻、二十九日、正木騎砲兵一千餘人、進犯沙田、騎兵七百、抄襲沙田北方之犬水坑、以大砲三十門向大水坑猛轟、華軍亦　砲迎擊、激戰至三十一日晨、尙在呂田大水坑血戰中、日軍正面中路者、係由從化北犯翁源·佛崗·爲牛島·角田·坪井·笠間·深堀·守永·福田·松本·吉田·各大隊、人數約一萬以上、華軍在英德以南佛崗之間、與日軍激戰、互相包抄、二十八日傍晚、戰事移於連江口、傳翁源已失陷、二十九日、日軍坪田·鍋島·的山戰兵團、到達新豐茶子圍及沙田附近、又與華軍發生血戰、良口圩以北、亦有天戰、日軍與華軍對戰者、爲佐賀·石田·兩部隊、三十日、日軍佐佐木·古賀·野口·正木·鍋島·偷襲連江口·午後四時、佐佐攻入英德城、發生巷戰、三十一日、粤北戰况、日軍右翼取大包抄、最前鋒離贛南僅四十哩、</p>
<p>日軍死傷　三萬以上</p>
<p>華方精銳部隊、元旦起、已由贛南趕到新豐·龍門·向東江上游、直撲日軍右翼方、旬日前所失各據點、即次第收復、同日華方空軍出動助戰、竄入英德之日軍、已經潰退、華方生力軍當以疾風掃落葉之姿勢、向連江口追擊、竄入翁源縣城之日軍、亦遭受側擊、損失極重、戰車與戰馬僵棄山徑者、路爲之塞、連江口日軍、二日、向官渡退走、又被華軍左右兩路抄襲、全部突圍南竄、近衛師一旅團、據守良口圩、掩護日軍後退、良口被華軍圍困四日之久、全旅殲滅殆盡、據興寗得前方軍事探報、日軍右翼、上月二十四日、採用大迂迥戰術、由增城·從化·經龍門·新豐、竄入翁源境、沿途所過、皆山嶺險峻地帶、但素爲兵家所忌者、以粤北地勢、北高南低、日軍此舉等於仰攻、開戰旬日、大小戰役四十餘次、每天平均三四次幾無片刻休息、右翼日軍死傷約四五千人、二十九日、翁源城郊之戰、日軍主力、被華方砲兵抑留於梅坑迥龍、無法通過、乃改犯石龍頭、上河洞、日軍死七百餘人、三十一日晚上至元旦淸晨、華方梅坑泡兵發揮威力、日軍乃從他處繞道進犯翁源英德交界之桂湖、在官渡及六里圩附近、與華方守軍混戰、反覆血搏、華軍始終不退、及至援軍次第到達前綫、即由元旦起、實施掃蕩、牛背脊·梅坑·（翁源新豐間）、分水坳·自鵝潭·白石坳（從化增城之間）各據點、相繼克復、此次日軍死傷、至少在三萬以上、大砲戰車、軍用器材、遺棄滿路、損失數目、不可勝計、故粤省戰局已全部轉入佳境、</p>
<p>日機轟炸豫省慘况（續）　鄭縣洛陽信陽南陽損害最大　偏僻鄉村亦難避免日機轟炸</p>
<p>丙·豫省消極防空　及防空警報設施概况</p>
<p>（一）警報設施、豫省洛陽鄭縣兩地、以市區較大、人口較多、故除設置電動及手搖警報器外、尙設有補助警報器、其他各縣市鎭鄕村、亦有鋼軌鑄鐘等警報設備、加以省內外對空監視隊哨、配備尙稱嚴密、故日機來襲、即能立時發佈警報、雖距日軍防區甚近之隴海沿綫各縣、亦從未遺誤、警報發佈時間、人民均可從容避難、</p>
<p>（二）避難設備、避難設備、爲人民在空襲下之安全保障、豫省地質堅固、水位較低、挖築防空地下室及防空壕井等、以避免轟炸、收効甚大、經防空部規定圖式、竭力督導、飭山各地行政主管機關、動員防護團員警察等、普徧挖築、計已完成之地下室共四千二百卅一座、至防空壕井等、則遍佈全省各市縣·及較大鄕鎮、故本省自抗戰迄今、雖遭轟炸五百餘次之多、而死傷人數較少、</p>
<p>（三）防護情形、爲應付日機轟炸、减少所予之一切損害、防護組織、自爲當務之急、經防空部縝密計畫嚴厲督導、現各市縣均有防護組織、即較大村鎭、亦有防護團之組設、一遇空襲、每一防護團員，在日機威脅下之慘烈環境中、咸能奮勇工作、此亦减少損害之一原因也、</p>
<p>（四）充實消防、日機之慘酷暴行、近更變本加厲、常在各城市投擲燃燒彈、防空部有見及此、曾督飭各縣府、先後組織消防隊、各隊消防器材、亦頗充實、現豫省各地、雖時有被日機投擲燃燒彈情事、皆能及時撲救、而火災之蔓延尙少、</p>
<p>（五）疏散情形、日軍因年來軍事上無力進展、轉向華軍後方不設防城市、濫肆轟炸、華方當局、爲保持長期抗戰之人力物力計、曾令飭疏散城市人口資源、河南各縣、經防空部分別督導、限期疏散、均已著有成績、今後日機來襲，建築物之損失、事實上雖難倖免、但於後方民衆、欲加傷害、則殊非易事、（完）</p>

<h3>日鈔得購郵票　並未呈准總局　係滬郵局長與日商定　蘇浙皖淪陷區亦照辦</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局、突定於本月十五日起、公衆得以日金或日軍用票購買郵票、此事已引起外間密切注意、茲探錄各情如次、</p>
<p>片面商定該局突發通吿、得以日金或日軍用票購買郵票、及其折合辦法、係由該局郵務長乍配林及日籍副郵務長金指謹一郞二人、與日方片面商定、顯然爲日方加於該局之一‘種壓力、故上海郵務長乍配林於此事之商談經過、及其決定、並未呈報郵政總局及交通部、</p>
<p>淪陷區域上海郵務長乍配林、現兼蘇浙皖三省郵區總視察、故江蘇·安徽·浙江·三省淪陷區域之郵局、亦於本月十五日起、同時實行、公衆得以日金或日軍用票、購買郵票、及其折合率辦法、故南京·安慶·杭州·三地郵局、亦已出貼同樣郵政通吿、</p>
<p>所謂理由又據大通社記者探悉、上海郵局突然允許以日金或日軍用票購買郵票之原因、據聞局方因淪陷區域各鐵路及航空均被日方强佔經營、致該局支付上項鐵路或航空之運輸郵件費用、均須日金支付、故深感日金缺乏、同時淪陷區域郵局、對於日金之拒用、由於環境關係、顯屬困難、如無折合率之規定、將使淪陷區郵局與日方之磨擦、日益尖銳、</p>
<p>機構完整上海郵局突許得以日金或日用票購買郵票、足以映示上海郵局處境之日益困難、惟郵局行政、則迄無變更、至該局現有日籍郵務員、計有副郵務長金指謹一郞·總巡員福家豐·及岡田寺一等三人、此外尙有不列等郵務員十餘人、上項不列等日籍郵務員、均往來淪陷區郵局担任與就地日軍部折衝事宜、此外尙有担任檢查員二十餘人、則不受局方管轄、</p>

<h3>北江西路封鎖綫內　設臨時小菜塲　甲區商店受影響</h3>
<p>蘇州河北甲區內狀况、據大通社記者昨日巡歷所見、雖尙安靜、惟商店營業顯較以前爲减少、緣北江西路東邊封鎖鐵絲網內、每晨亦有臨時小菜塲之設立綫外商店營業不免受其影響、又海寗路封鎖錢缺口、目前已將其面積擴大、故除人力車汽車外、老虎車小車等已極暢通、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、因報載有息、利空利多、各有可能、蓋一謂英屬海峽殖民地政府已頒佈禁止與限制非英錄國之貨物入口、故上海出口方面、不免亦受影響、一則謂日本阿部內閣、勢在必倒、故繼任人選問題成爲人心揣測之重心、但經營者因上述各說、眞相不明、故多數仍抱覜望、靜待事態之明朗、致當日變動尙狹、趨勢先鬆而後回緊、結果較隔昨稍軟、晨初均平、嗣因港電與出口商前來吐塞、驟現硬化、外商銀行曾吸進過四辦士八九〇六二五及八元一二五鬆價、斯時四辦士八七五及八元〇六二五可結、旋因賣者絕跡、致漸回平、一度本月份美滙尙難購結、後以華行稍吐、遂形平定、迨至十一時許、因稍有零星結款、且不久沙遜亦跟扒遠期貨、加之某美行亦有吃胃、故市象遂反呈軟化、迄至收盤、祗吿四辦士八四三七五、及七元九六八七五、午後情况更形呆滯、直至晚收、毫無變動、價仍與午收相埒、結果微緊〇一五六二五及〇三一二五、期貨趨勢、與現貨同途、</p>
<p>沙遜結進本月期</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均漲一二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法·等匯俱平、美對英跌半分、對淞未更、對法小三七五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士八五火三七五、美匯八元、較上日均無榮辱、開後港電首來塞出、且出口商亦跟踪吐售、故市面驟形硬化、計港電吐予外行現貨英金四辦士八九〇六二五、繼而出口商亦售予華比現貨美匯八元一二五、時外行賣價則討四辦士八七五及八元〇六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大〇·七五、此後賣風已息、市勢遂見回軟、一度本月份美匯八元、尙難結得、斯時華行稍來賣出本月份美匯爲八元及</p>
<p>後市交易殊岑寂</p>
<p>後市成交更淸英匯且鮮聞做開、美匯僅有利售予華商本月份價爲七元九三七五、市况極形沉寂、價亦鮮乏榮辱、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士八四七五、美匯七元九六八七五、本月份英金四辦士八二八一二五、美匯七元九三七五、下月份英金四辦士七六五六二五、美匯七元八一二五、結果比上日現期英均緊〇一五六二五、美俱軟〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港十一日電。今晨匯市開盤吿平、英匯現期貨及日匯現貨均不動、美匯現貨緊〇六二五、爲二十四元半、申匯現貨降一元、爲三百〇四元、十時正、英匯現貨鬆〇三一二五、爲一先令二便士九三七五、近期不動、美匯現貨回長〇六二五、仍爲二十四元六二五、申匯現貨續降一元、爲三百〇三元、十一時三十分平穩無變動、午收市面吿平、申匯現貨回升三元、爲三百〇六元、下午二時三十分開盤平平無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津英鬆美略緊</p>
<p>天津十一日電、今晨旅市開盤吿平、英匯現貨鬆〇六二五、爲四便士五六二五、美匯現貨緊一二五、爲七元半、申匯升三元、爲一百〇七元、「聯鈔」暗盤昂半元、爲九十六元、</p>
<p>金市無大變動</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、終日毫無生色、上落殊微、蓋以當日滙市變動仍狹、買賣淸閒、情勢由疲轉堅、乃外滙先鬆後緊故也、初開吿跌八元、爲四千〇七十元、原因滙市報鬆、銀樓帮首塞、加之現金號亦稍跟賣、故撳小至四千零七十元低價、十一時後、因外滙軟化、且某錢兌業又來拖入不少、致拉高至四千零八十一元、而收盤則爲四千零八十元、午後初開因錢兌業撳價賣出、加以進者一時觀望、竟硬撳十元、後某銀號乘賤代客買入二百餘兩、遂拉提至四千零八十一元高價收盤、結果軋漲三元、全天交易减少、祇六七百兩、銀樓飾金呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤回漲三元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外滙硬化、銀樓帮首來塞出、致開市遂撳八元、銀樓帮售予證券帮十兩、爲四千零七十元、少頃金號趁賤撈入、且外匯止鬆回平、不久某錢兌業跟踪收買、致漸回高、金號進證券帮二十兩、爲四千零八十元、嗣以銀樓帮及現金號同來套賣、而進者吃胃轉淡、復又步降、現金號售予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千零七十元、此後塲內沉靜頗久、迨至十一時半光景、因匯市反形緊軟、引起買風、某錢兌業復來力進百餘兩、遂抬起十元、繼而某銀號進證券帮十兩、爲四千零八十一元、後證券帮又塞予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千零八十元作午收價、午後初開疲落、因某錢兌業撳價賣出、目進者一時觀望、竟硬壓小十元、錢兌業售予證券帮十兩、爲四千零七十元、嗣後某銀號見賤在拖二百餘兩、遂步步回高、某銀號及錢兌業各進錢兌業十兩、爲四千零八十一元作晚收價、結果回漲三元、全天祇十一元上落、現余號之木牌金照烚赤高數元、收進减小二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未更、大同行仍懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>美金票獨見鬆軟</h3>
<p>昨日外幣穩定、英美金鎊供求未殷、市價不動、英美金票初無軒輊、午後交易漸增、因鎊價堅挺、故美金票獨下降、晚市爲十二元五角六分、香港票法郞票吸納微股、市價稍堅、安南　供給見稀、市價微俏、日金票需要趨暢、市價稍秀、晚市爲一元二角六分七厘、朝鮮票交易呆滯、晚市仍爲一元零五分、昨日市價、英金票升二角、美金票降四分、香港票升一分、法郎票升五厘、安南票升二分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現由高而低</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、始高終低、每千元初曾做高至三十三元半、但不久即見回下、午刻三十二元半、下午更退至三十二元、再軋小一元、錢業公會拆息、晨午兩市仍懸一角五分原牌云、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷凋零　紗價日降</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風漸熾、此因實需太淸、以致一般國戶手貨日增、加之廠方開出之額量殊巨、業已到期、墊銀出淸、勢所必然、同時匯票亦在水平綫上、尤使投機家意態闌珊、於此多頭、勢難安逸、至於浮多紛起斬結、惟大戶某某等吸收之額、一時尙不肯忍痛斬結、市盤尙在醞釀中、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市塲仍少生氣、多方雖竭力支持、叫喊極盛、然買進做多者缺乏興奮性、二十支雙馬開價爲七百二十三元、比上日跌三元半、少頃聞外匯續長、然人氣仍堅、拉緊仍不放棄、微跌至二十一元、後經多頭維持、復至七百二十三元、此時成交甚淡、收盤時又見下降、查半日間成交統計一千三百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌六元、天女跌六元、雙地球跌七元、今日有紗一百二十件運厦門、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、內行　一、二五〇　香港　二二〇　厦門　三〇福州　一〇　天津　一〇　內地　五統計　一、三三五</p>
<h3>棉市沉寂</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉趨沉寂、同行買賣亦不及昔日之興旺、廠方需要亦屬停滯、納胃閉塞不展、實則紗銷旣凋零、而存貨增進、且年關催近、人心轉疲、蘇北來源、到通花四千四百七十六包、北沙來三千八百七十包、茲將現棉情形列左、火機花　一六二·五〇　同行進　一八〇包火機花　一六三·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇包常熟花　一七一·五〇　同行進　一〇〇包北太　一六九·五〇　又　三二〇包火木架　一六〇·〇〇　又　二八〇包冲通　一六三·〇〇　又　一七五包火機花　一七〇·五〇　統一廠　二、〇〇〇包通花　一七一·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇包又　一七二·〇〇　又　一八〇包</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市昨晨開盤、因海外棉商之在市賣出、故形疲乏狀態、後因同業購買、及一部份空頭抵補、市况轉形堅定、結果收盤回漲、價格較之上日尙漲二三磅音、印度連同預測跌落五羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅昔、利物浦市况無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見靜寂、然略有活躍之曙光、蓋因日來匯兌較爲平穩、同業亦擬久靜意動、頗有採購外棉之意也、日方廠商未見動靜已久、一般預測、將開始購美、茲將昨日棉市以美匯八元折合送廠價列下、二十支美米特林　一三八·〇〇又又下級　二二三·八五三十二支又　二四〇·五〇又又下級　二二四·五〇四十二支又　二四五·〇〇又又下級　二三六·八〇</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤奇貨可居　同行拆價又漲五元</h3>
<p>印度喀爾喀塔烟煤、自歐戰以來、因路途遙遠、水脚飛漲、一般定貨行家、以危險太重、不願輕蹈、故近數月來、本埠迄無到貨、端賴存底支持殘局、雖浦東各棧尙有老貨兩萬餘噸、但貨主乘近日市上開平斷檔之際、奇貨可居、趁勢抬上、日昨同行拆價、又加五元、塊煤每噸一百三十元、煤屑一百十八元、棧房出貨、現鈔交易、祇有零星成交、多數亦不肯出售、本街門荘、喀爾喀塔塊　每噸一百三十六元、煤屑一百二十四元、送到客家、行扛在外、</p>
<h3>絲茶　國外絲價下瀉　本市尙形穩定</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、日美繼續疲軟、紐的近期跌一角、遠期跌一角、日絲各跌一角四分、華絲小一角一分、橫濱現貨小四十七元、遠期漲四元、本埠絲市、尙無漲跌表示、蓋洋行無法售開也、印莊千金絲續有交易、價一千八百廿元、雖同前市面應視爲高漲、因邇日國外絲價下瀉甚巨也、（按紐約近期已下跌二角强、橫濱已跌去一二〇元）、觀察絲市趨向、未必作劇跌、然在目前、則市氣較疲、又絲經今有三十四件及茶葉五十三件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白續跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市仍軟、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白·以及轉口貨均叫原價無更動、太古車白則續見下降三五角至一元不一、B嘜東棧五十八元、西棧五十八元半、CW嘜五十七元半、東棧五十七元、CW嘜西棧五十七元、DY嘜五十六元七角、HX嘜五十六元半、荷赤本棧貨四十五元半、本綿白及一號冰俱持原盤、國糖開出不多、廣帮開出惠州次白八十外包、五十二元、建帮開出泉州洋六十包、四十八元、無成交、</p>
<h3>疋頭　春季呢絨　本街已在搜羅</h3>
<p>咋呢絨應時冬貨、實銷有限、因國曆年底已過、陰曆年底轉瞬將屆、故市銷續遜、惟大路貨現售價、大多數反見上漲、則因有鑒於日後到貨缺乏故耳、至春夏需銷之薄花絨嗶嘰。華特呢派力司·法蘭絨紗蔴膠布之類、同業大半齊有吸墊收進、公茶會上、祇聞買聲、不聞賣聲、亦可見呢絨之昂俏矣、查春夏貨呢絨本街賣買如此之早、實爲呢絨業歷來未有云、又布疋今日有二百五十七件、運往厦門、又十三件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>藥材　白芥子到存兩稀</h3>
<p>白芥子產自天津、近以來　寥落、而廣帮採辦頗頻、其勢日昂、查前市開過三十五元、刻市須售四十元、今存積旣薄、苟無被到、後尙看好、</p>
<h3>潮雲產量不豐</h3>
<p>柏子亦名潮雲、（即小靑皮原料）、前號貨到過一批、售開爲五十五元、係產自汕頭者、近又到有福建貨、以質地較次、僅售三十五元、惟油頭貨身份高尙、且產量不豐、市間底積亦尠、並不以建貨廉售而稍受影響、故後市仍呈穩定、</p>
<h3>南北貨　湘蓮高昂</h3>
<p>湘蓮近以到稀、市價續緊、本湖蓮升五元、行盤本街售一百六十五元、即普通色次之饒州蓮、亦售一百五十五元、下檔湖蓮八十五元至八十元、白蓮到存均薄、行售一百七十五元、</p>
<h3>粵枝號盤見降</h3>
<p>金山枝邇來到貨不多、市勢軟弱見鬆、昨北市號家開出普通新元枝一百零七元、陳元枝不及百元、糯米枝續降、僅一百八十餘元、</p>
<h3>雜訉　寗波物價高漲原因</h3>
<p>寗波除糧食與土產外、其餘物價均甚昂貴、如戰前兩角一斤之次白糖、現非元許不辦矣、他如黃糖每斤六角、絨綫（英雄牌）每磅九元五角、絨襪每雙六七角、生豆油每斤一元二角、火油每斤七角、洋火每盒五分、固本皂每塊二角五分、白報紙每令四五十元、鐵釘每磅一元四角等、均較戰前漲起數倍、其高漲原因、不外有二、（一）鎮海口封鎖、運輸困難、（二）自武漢失守、內地商民均紛紛改道寗波採辦、尤以重慶昆明二帮爲多、故滬貨一到、輒被訂購一空、而當地民衆、反不能得貨、有其上述原因、則寗波物價遂不得不漲矣、（濤）</p>

<h3>我們怎樣組織「讀書會」</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>目前，爲了紙價飛漲，百物昂貴的緣故，上海的書價，也比較戰前的要貴起不少，買本雜誌，最起碼也得要幾毛錢，其他像敎科書，影印西書等，沒一種不都是漲起幾倍的。有什麼方法可使我們出了少數的金錢，讀到多量的書報雜誌？這一個問題因此就自然地在我們的腦海里徘徊了，「讀書會」的組織也可以說是：就在這個問題下成立的。</p>
<p>在三個月前。首先由筆者動機起來組織「讀書會」，果眞，所獲得的結果，非常滿意；起初祗是我的幾個知已的朋友作爲「讀書會」的基本會員，約過了半個月之後，加入的會員漸漸地增多了，會方的經費也相當寬裕了，到了目前，我們每個月可以看到一本新書，幷且還有十多種的雜誌。我感覺到：「讀書會」在目前實在是一種必需的組織，在英國，這種「讀書會」是非常普遍的，會員也極衆多，對於文化界與敎育界所發生的影響，因此也非常深而且大，爲了藥解決生活的難題，我們必須要實行「消費合作」，同樣地，爲了要解決讀書的難題，我們爲什麼不來組織「讀書會」呢？</p>
<p>開頭，我先對幾個親熱的朋友寫了這樣的一封像信樣的東西：</p>
<p>『先生：目前上海書價的昂貴，恐怕你不會否認吧。我們何不趕快地起來組織一個「讀書會」呢？每一個月，當你挪到薪水的時候，我們不妨提出五毛或一元錢，來加入「讀書會」爲會員，之後，我們就可以享受閱讀會方所購置的各項書報雜誌的權利了。你喜歡讀書嗎？如果高興的話，那末，就請你在後面簽上個名字吧。再有，你最歡喜看的雜誌是什麼呢？你最歡喜想要讀的書籍又是什麽呢？在這里，爲了使會方便利購書起見，我以爲，也有請諸位各自將心愛的，想讀的書名寫下的必要。』</p>
<p>結果很好，我們每人都贊成，每個月挪出一元錢來。購置的雜誌呢，目前計有西風，西風副刊，宇宙風，天下事，密勒氏評論週報，中國評論周報，T'ien　Hsia，ChinaJiurnal，Readers'Digest，Magazine'sDigest，Parade等共十一種。第一個月的新書是林語堂的MomentsinPeking；第二個月是西風社出版的「翻譯論集」；本月份亦已預定去買一本商務出版，傳東華翻譯的「吉訶德先生」。</p>
<p>我們幷且還規定：雜誌每兩天掉一本，新書每人限借一星期，當然，在開始的時候，每一個會員是不能够都有一本新書看的。但是我希望：我們能够在最近的將來，就會有足够的會費來購備大批的新書。</p>
<p>我們每一個人都是喜歡看書的同志，幷且共同都有這樣的一個願望：就是儘量地利用業餘的閑暇來看書。我們不會吸烟，不會叉麻雀，也不會跳舞，也不會跑戲館，我們只希望，我們的學識能够與這個大時代的巨輪同進，而暗地里能够使人生愈臻完美，因而促使我們這個充滿着荊棘的社會能够漸漸地光明起來！</p>
<h3>為什麼要收補考費</h3>
<p>— 郭勝</p>
<p>欲談補考費，先要說到補考。補考之原意：（一）學生考試之分數雖不及格，但尙未至必須重讀之程度。又因考試雖係平日所得之測騐，但亦含有投機之成份，故特許以再試機會；（二）因病未考，查明屬實，若逕令其重讀，似頗不妥，故命其重行考試。此種再試，即名之「補考」。補考之原意如是，而所以收補考費者，其理由有謂「敎員改二次考卷，校中費二次精神，損失紙張」；有謂「補考費所以罰再試之學生」。第　說余極不贊同，敎員之精神在竭力敎授學生，以達服務人羣之目的，如「一分精神一分財」、似太不合理；校中紙張，須徵收費用，此商店之行爲，似不能爲學校者所採取。第二說近乎「寓罰於錢」，此爲抽稅之規則，爲烟酒捐之存在理由，不能作爲補考費之理由。而上述二理由，又不能說明因病補考，爲何須補考費。總之，補考費極不合理。</p>
<p>補考費旣不合理，而各學校徵收之數額，又極爲過分。我校校章規定：「補考費每課收三元，六課以上者一律收十八元。」此規定從一方面看來，太過分；另一方面看來，又與商店中「越多買越便宜」相似，豈非笑話？而校中敎師因補考費之故，每故扣分數，以獲得較多補考費，此爲事實。</p>
<p>補考費雖如此不合理，但各上海各大學各中學，不規定補老費者極少，故我願學校當局革除此不合理之規定，不革除者，赤請减少數額，或對於因病未老之同學，予以免繳之規定，因近日生活費異漲，以敎育爲己任之先生們，似不應再加家長以負擔。</p>
<h3>雨過天晴</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十九回　看花賞月活動成家　種玉孕珠娠妊有術</p>
<p>朱愛人道：『後來那女子生育了沒有？』唐惠貞道：「你聽我講啦！醫師給她檢騐身體時，以爲她是爲再嫁丈夫的地步，希望再嫁丈夫後，有生育之希望。誰知她知道自己可以生育後，便去請求一位擅長人工娠姙法的醫師，要敎他施行人工娠姙。但她是一位寡婦，丈夫已經死了三年，這精子向那裏去取得呢？她說：請你選一個强健的男子，徵求精子，我可以給他極大的報酬。但切不可吿訴他是誰要施行這人工娠姙，而那個男子姓甚名誰，你也不必吿訴我。我雖向他借了種子，仍以秘密之法行之，省得後來多所嚕囌。那位醫師依計而行，向男子們徵求精子，有些却不肯浪費精子，有的果然答應了，也依着她的秘密條件。醫師在醫院把男女兩人隔離了，不使見面，然後施行手術。手術凡施行了三次，後來那位寡婦，居然有孕了。腹漸膨脹，與其他孕婦一樣，到了懷孕期滿，順利地就在他們的醫院生產了。生下來却是一個女孩子，那寡婦心中有些不滿，她抱怨那位醫師道：我要的是一個男孩子，不是一個女孩子，我不是早給你說了嗎。醫師苦笑着道：夫人！我已算是給你盡了力了。但是我硏究了人工娠姙法已是個大發明。而對於「男女選擇法」，雖也有那種學說，可是還不會發明咧。除非是再來一回，但我也只能包養孩子，却不能包養兒子呀！」唐惠貞說着，笑個不休。朱愛人道：「後來她曾否重施手術，達到生兒的目的嗎？」唐惠貞道：『這個可不知道咧！那種執性的婦人，也許達到了目的不可。但第二次施術借種的男子，决非第一次施術借種的男子了。這個我們不必去講它了，總之無論是男子，是女子，是只有其母而沒有其父了。這個兒女，當然不是她前夫的兒女，可是她也沒有後夫，這兒女的父母，是不知誰何？所謂法律上的直系尊親屬，只有一半。但她是個寡婦，儘可自由，無人可以干涉她。她以膝下空虛，要一個兒子，也是人情之常。至於小孩子生下來了，不知父姓，只姓母姓，也未嘗不可。只是我想這個風氣一開，推波逐瀾，擴而充之，字典上這個父字，可以消滅咧。（二二六）</p>
<h3>婦女敎育館來函</h3>
<p>春秋主編先生：頃讀貴欄「投考婦女敎育館」一文，關於敝館招考辦事員一節，雖無詆毀之意，但有與事實不符者，敬爲先生一陳之：</p>
<p>（一）敝館鑒於一機關事務人員地位之重要，特慎重考選眞實人材，是根據實際需要着眼，藉以掃除通常以親友介紹之陋習。</p>
<p>（二）章程規定月薪三十元，供給膳宿，試用五月，成績優良者繼續聘用發給聘書，原文云五個月後才有飯吃，才有薪金拿，是一誤會。</p>
<p>（三）以現在普通學校對於珠算與書法之忽視，敝館預料投考者不過四五十人，結果投考者達一百十四名，分兩敎室舉行，初試錄取三十名，復試錄取鄧嘉棣，單德芬，貝級蘭，李玉年，徐茹等五名。原文謂投考者一百五十名，分三敎室舉行云云，又一誤會。</p>
<p>（四）珠算考題，方法極簡易，至於分量事先曾經敝館同人試做，五十分鐘可以完成。珠算爲辦事員必需技能，且以迅速爲貴，因事實上困難，曾延遲十分鐘收卷，但佳卷並不少，原文所云，想係作者不諳此項技術而云然。</p>
<p>（五）常識考試，因事實上需要，對於現代社會實際生活特加注意之故，不能拘於原子分子公式原理之呆板，如果以一般投考普通學校之態度而預備，自感失望而落空。</p>
<p>上列各條，意有未盡，附奉簡章一份，及考卷全份，敬請參閱，藉明眞相，專此敬請撰安。</p>

<h3>埃洛茀林的奮鬭史</h3>
<p>— 恕</p>
<p>十年苦幹聲譽纔卓著　妻子是獨手却很恩愛</p>
<p>誰都知道，目前武俠片中最受歡迎的，要算是隸屬於華納兄弟公司的武俠演員埃洛茀林了，他今年纔二十六歲，可是已經有這樣的聲譽。</p>
<p>出身清苦</p>
<p>他是南美洲一個礦工的晚生子，在他產生的第二個月裏，他的老父勃林克特就溘然和他長別，但幸虧他的母親靠着十指的辛勤工作，總算把一家的生活，勉强維持下來，因此在埃洛茀林中學校還沒有畢業的時候，已經開始與生活奮鬭了，一九三〇年派拉蒙公司曾大量的羅致電影人材，於是他就在這年加入了派拉蒙公司，因爲他那時還祗有十七歲，所以僅僅做些簡單的剪接工作，而他却已感到萬分的滿意，因爲他那時已自信至少比死去的老父所做的礦工生活，要略勝一籌。這樣過了二年後，他開始調派到編劇科裏工作，就在這年他費了不少的心血，竟然編製成一個劇本名「魔國春朝」，後來經過公司當局審查後，也認爲很滿意，所以不久又擢升爲編劇科的顧問，更在這年的冬天，接連在「慕赫尼」等二片中，客串演出，結果演技的優越，又出於一般意料之外，於是公司裏決定給他兼任高級演員的職位，以後會與最近逝世的范朋克合演過一部武俠片「伏象血戰記」。</p>
<p>再上銀幕</p>
<p>一九三四年的初冬，他與公司發生了很小的裂痕，就在那年正式與派拉蒙脫離了。此後，他曾在勒賽城郊外創設一家膠片製造廠，結果在短短的半年中，就虧蝕了很大的數目，於是除了把歷年儲積的錢，全部虧蝕外，他還負了五千多金的債務，於是不得不將該廠宣吿停頓。那時華納兄弟影片公司的主人雪爾莫華納，得到了埃洛有重返影界的企圖，於是親自要求埃洛加入華納，埃洛爲情勢所迫，乃毅然允諾，結果簽訂了一年六個月的合同，但那時週薪却訂明祗有一百四十美金。</p>
<p>演藝成熟</p>
<p>加入華納後，與愛德華羅賓蓀合演的「玫瑰戰潮」還沒有攝製完成時，已經與該公司女職員烏納雪克戀愛成熟而宣吿結婚，這位新娘却祗有一隻左手，埃洛對她的情感，却十分恩愛。以後他就接連主演了「彼得大帝自傳」「堊堡風「」新羅賓漢」「英烈傳」「羅賓漢」等十餘部武俠片，結果因爲演技的逐步進展，以致在「彼得大帝自傳」一片問世後，他的聲譽就蒸蒸日上，一直到一九三六年出品的「英烈傳」一片公映後，於是埃洛茀林繼被世界影迷公認為專演武俠片之魁首。以出演紅生蜚聲劇壇之名藝員林樹森，此次受鑫記大舞台之聘訂於夏曆元旦正式登台合同定期一年右即共「掃松」劇照</p>
<h3>黎園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>美男子李香勻與臧嵐光</p>
<p>北平票界中有兩人戲料甚美，一爲回敎徒李香勻，一爲王蕙芳高足臧嵐光，二人年均二十四五，身個扮相均適合唱花衫的條件，而嗓音又皆消越可聽。數年前李曾有北方第一美男子之稱，民國念二年夏不佞抵平，友人垣大同（爲舊京名評劇家）及王子伸兩君一日偕一美少年詣余寓所，見其裝飾入時，脂粉氣甚重，猶疑係內行中後起名旦，旋經垣君介紹，始悉此即聞名已久之美男子李香勻也。一月後彼在東安市塲吉祥園演「覇王別姬」，特轉托垣君邀余往觀，余等至時，則見隔廂中有一白髮老翁，已先余等而至，觀其年齡已八旬以外，然精神甚健，當李之「別姬」出塲時，此老興致允佳，時而鼓掌，時而談笑，舞劍一塲，台下掌聲四起，（實則劍法並不高明）此老頷首微笑，更爲得意，劇終人散，渠猶巫坐不動；少時見香勻草草卸裝畢，面上胭粉尙未洗凈，即披一大衣亟趨老者前，扶其下樓，同登汽車而去，後詢諸垣大同君，始知此老乃江瀚先生也。江任北平古物保存所所長，亦平市有名耆紳，香勻爲其義子，江愛之甚於親生，舉凡香勻延師習劇，置辦行頭，種種費用，無不由江出資襄助，即李每次出演，江亦照例定包廂二三及正廳數排，是故歷年此老對於香勻之資助爲數當亦不尠。（一七一）</p>
<h3>慘遭暗殺之任黛黛</h3>
<p>— 冰冰</p>
<p>父係粵人母為菲籍　飄零身世不勝淒涼</p>
<p>慘遭暗殺之名舞女任黛黛，案發後轟傳一時，舞女羣尤深致驚嘆。共被害情形，係先將咽喉勒住，復就下部猛戳多刀致死，看樣子眞是不勝凄慘。一個出賣色相的少女，竟會遭受到這樣的毒手，該是多麽的不幸與可憐。</p>
<p>任黛黛原籍廣東，以前在香港鬻舞，便早是位體名鵲噪的紅舞星。來滬後隸於滬西惠爾登舞廳，至今也有一年了。黛黛芳齡現僅二十歲，身世亦正十分凄凉。原來，她的父親是粵人，母親則係菲列濱籍，且於黛黛童年時期，即吿失蹤。所以，她是一個「國際之愛」的夾種的女人。而她的父親，現亦早經下世了。</p>
<p>在前一時期，有位某「武裝人員」，對她追求得非常熱烈，而她的態度只是很落寞的，頗似不以爲然。但在黃金買笑的歡娛塲中，這也是一種通常情形。是否就爲因愛成仇，動了殺機，或尙另有其他複雜原因、這就未便從旁臆測，只能說它還是一個疑問。</p>
<p>這幕慘劇的發生地，——靜安別墅一零九號某公寓中，她在那裏住的房間是十一號。起先，舞塲方面爲她接連三天，無故缺席，打電話去也沒有音息，大家都說任黛黛是失蹤了。誰知道她早浴血慘死，久已魂歸離恨天；等到公寓僕役進門去循例打掃而獰然發覺這幕可怖的塲面時，可憐她血已流得週身乾涸，早沒有桃花那樣紅豓的色澤了！</p>
<h3>雛燕新聲</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>早期的幾位歌唱明星如羅第萬里，亞爾喬生等，現在都漸漸地不被觀衆注意了，「低音歌王」平克勞斯貝，也遭遇了同樣的命運，但是他還在繼續着攝片，如上一部「巴黎蜜月」却顯然地已側重在喜劇形式了；這部「雛燕新聲」呢，我們不能否認是借重琳黛惠兒來號召的。琳黛惠兒能歌唱，也能演戲，好萊塢的人才輩出，大槪也是使早期的歌星漸漸退隱的原因。</p>
<p>至於「鄒燕新聲」的演出，導演手腕的軟弱，是不能辭其咎的，他祇是依照着劇本介紹故事，而不能把幾塲較重要的戲操縱起來。如賴雷訓練兒童的艱苦：在上演之夕，突然被紐約兒童保護會禁止；琪思成功時，賴雷精神上的術突等，都輕地放棄了。甚至幾塲表演，都不能運用活潑的鏡頭來加强當時的音樂氛圍；更可惜的，譚洛許大樂隊沒有充份地介紹給觀衆，祇用了一個「遠景」了事。</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝與女角羅薏斯克姆貝兒則更是這個戲的附庸，一無可取。</p>

<h3>Details of the Chinese Army's Attack on Baotou: Intercepting Japanese Army's Telegram for Assistance, Then Attacking, Guerrilla Forces Disrupting the Japanese Rear as Assistance</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Detailed information about the Chinese army's attack on Baotou has just arrived here from Suiyuan. It is said that the purpose of the Chinese army's attack was to recover Baotou in order to disrupt the Japanese army's plan to advance further west after the Yellow River freezes. A special circumstance in this decisive battle was the lack of convenient transportation in the Mongolian plains. According to the Sui West Chinese Army Headquarters, the Chinese army launched its attack on Baotou after intercepting a Japanese radio message issued from Baotou on December 18 requesting reinforcements. According to a letter issued on December 21 from Shangbai (transliteration) in Sui West, the Chinese army, under the personal leadership of General Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Sui, launched a multi-pronged attack on December 12. It is reported that a squadron of the Chinese Air Force heavily bombed the Ping Sui Railway and the Japanese barracks east of Baotou before the Chinese army launched its offensive. When the Chinese regular army launched its offensive, guerrilla forces disrupted the Japanese rear, providing active assistance. The first route of the Chinese army advanced eastward from Sui West towards Baotou on December 12. The second route attacked Saqi from Sui South. The third route cut off the railway to Datong northwest of Sui East. The Chinese army on the Chahar border also advanced to the railway line near Zhangjiakou. A squadron of Hui cavalry went to the Mongolian grasslands north of Baotou to protect the flanks of the Chinese army. The Chinese army secretly detoured, passing through 300 kilometers of Mongolian territory, hiding during the day and traveling at night. When they traveled through the Mongolian grasslands at full speed, they did not carry tents or cooking stoves. Each soldier carried several pounds of flatbread. Water was scarce along the way, and water bottles were useless in temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius. Therefore, each soldier drank water only once every 24 hours on average. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Presses Toward Yicheng</h3>

(11th dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The attention of the Chinese in this area to the Sino-Japanese war is still focused on South China. It is generally expected that the war in that area will soon restart. There are two reasons for this: (1) The Chinese army is stepping up its offensive in the Nanning area. (2) It is rumored that Wang Jingwei is planning to establish a puppet government in Guangzhou. According to telegrams from the Chinese army in front of Nanning, the Chinese army is now preparing to launch another offensive northeast of Nanning. The traffic between Nanning and Kunlun Pass, which was cut off by the Chinese army in late December, was once restored by the Japanese army, but it has now been cut off again by the Chinese army. It is reported that after a fierce attack, the Chinese army has recovered Wutang, 17 miles southeast of Nanning, and Qitang, 23 miles away. At the same time, according to Chinese sources, Japanese aircraft have heavily bombed various cities in Guinan. Yesterday, Guilin had air raid alerts all day. The extent of the damage has not yet been reported in detail. It is also reported that the Japanese are currently rushing reinforcements into the Nanning area. It is reported that the construction of a port by the Japanese at Longmen near Qinzhou has been completed. Chinese sources generally expect that after the Japanese have completed the construction of the port, they will begin landing large-scale troops and equipment. It is said that the arrival of Japanese reinforcements can now be seen at various points north of Nanning. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cantonese Chinese Army Marches Directly Towards Xinjie</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing: A few days ago, the Chinese army launched attacks across the river from two routes. One route marched directly towards Xinjie along Yinzhan'ao, and the other route detoured through Shijiao and Guotai, copying out Chi and Baini. Now, the various units have joined together, and the remaining Japanese forces cannot break through the encirclement. One force of about 3,000 people is currently being annihilated by the Chinese in the area between Yinzhan'ao and Shijiao. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: At 10:00 this morning, the Chinese army killed many Japanese soldiers in Conghua. The remaining Japanese forces retreated in disarray towards Guangzhou. The Chinese are taking advantage of the victory to search forward. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>A dispatch from a certain location in Northern Guangdong: The Japanese army retreating from Qinglonggang is continuing to retreat. There is now definitely no trace of the Japanese north of Qinglonggang. The Chinese army is pursuing them. (Central 10th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Solemnly Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At a reception for news reporters this afternoon, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson solemnly denied rumors that the "New Central Government" plan had reached an understanding with the Chongqing National Government. The spokesperson also strongly stated that the National Government has no relationship with any puppet regime, either in fact or in law. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources here generally expect that a puppet government will soon be established in Guangzhou. It is rumored that the Japanese army has recently launched a northward attack on Shaoguan along the railway in Guangdong, with the intention of preparing for the establishment of a puppet regime in South China. The failure of the Japanese army's offensive will likely affect this plan. Gu Mengyu's recent arrival in Chongqing has also dealt a blow to this plan. Gu arrived in Chongqing by air from Hong Kong last month and is reported to have made a firm statement opposing the peace movement. Gu had very successful talks with various government leaders and flew back to Hong Kong on December 14. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Mr. Volleys' Proposal</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper carried a Washington dispatch, reporting that Democratic Congressman Volleys expressed his views on the Far East issue, advocating that "the United States, Japan, and other countries stationing troops within China should agree to withdraw all of them, so that the Chinese can handle everything themselves without interference from other countries, which is the reasonable solution to various difficulties in the Far East." Mr. Volleys' implication is that he believes this proposal is a perceptive and insightful view of the Far East situation and has a constructive nature. Therefore, he plans to exchange views with the U.S. authorities in the near future. If international relations seek long-term peace and stability, and if disputes are ultimately resolved based on common sense and reason, then we firmly believe that Mr. Volleys' proposal will be adopted by all parties. Even today, the simplest and most reasonable way to resolve the difficulties in the Far East is to promote the realization of Mr. Volleys' proposal. We would like to elaborate further on Mr. Volleys' proposal.</p>
<p>The stationing of troops in China by various countries, based on treaties, is a legacy of the 19th century. China has always respected treaties, so even though it knows that it is unreasonable for foreign troops to be stationed within its borders, it has never demanded that various countries withdraw their troops. The rights of various countries in China are also best guaranteed by China's respect for treaties, and are by no means dependent on the stationing of troops. Therefore, in terms of the relationship between China and various countries, there is fundamentally no need to station troops. As for troops outside the treaties, their nature and actions can only be interpreted as aggression. China must resist aggressor troops when they attack, and must drive them away when they are stationary. This inevitably leads to a state of war. Ending the war requires either the defeat and collapse of the aggressor troops or their withdrawal. Therefore, in terms of the facts, at least troop withdrawal is the inevitable outcome. If aggressor troops attempt to obtain treaty-based justification for continuing to be stationed within Chinese borders, this is a treaty that the Chinese people and government will absolutely not accept. To reiterate, the impossibility of this kind of attempt is like trying to revert the 20th century back to the 19th century, equally impossible. If aggressors say that treaties require the stationing of troops, it is tantamount to saying that aggression is indispensable, that continuing the war is indispensable. Resistance is originally something China does not shrink from, but it is far from the aggressors' hoped-for resolution of the dispute!</p>
<p>Mr. Volleys hopes that the Japanese will not disregard his suggestion. We assert that Japan's aggression is ultimately doomed to failure, so it will ultimately be unable to disregard Mr. Volleys' suggestion, but that is not what we are talking about today. Today, the Japanese consciousness is in a state of turmoil, its actions are in a state of perversity, and its consciousness and actions are in a state of contradiction. Therefore, toward China, it flaunts morality but continues to plunder, hopes for peace but continues to wage war, and is exhausted and weakened but remains ambitious. Toward the international community, Britain, the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union, it does not know what to do, and toward the United States it cries, laughs, complains, and flatters, and still does not know what to do. Domestically, there are recent politically confused political upheavals. In the case of such a Japan, how is Mr. Volleys' hope that it will not disregard his suggestion any different from expecting a madman to accept reason? Or has Mr. Volleys ever diagnosed the symptoms? If a tranquilizer were administered at the beginning of his madness, it could be expected that he would return to tranquility. If his diet were cut off at the beginning of his madness, it could be expected that he would quickly conform. Unfortunately, the international community at the beginning not only failed to use treaties and justice to tranquilize him, but also used politeness to encourage his arrogance, and used arms and raw materials to enhance his strength, and thus he has been mad for a long time until today. Now he is both mad and exhausted. For the plan today, how should effective sanctions be launched from various aspects of diplomacy and economy to weaken his mad strength, to restrict his mad behavior, and thereby to promote the restoration of his reason? We believe that what Mr. Volleys proposes are the conditions for resolving the Far East dispute after Japan has restored its reason. To promote its restoration of reason, the U.S. Congress must first take action in diplomacy and economy. Is Mr. Volleys speaking nonsense?</p>
<h3>Former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson Advocates Banning Arms and Raw Materials to Japan, Advocates that the U.S. Should Refuse to Mediate in the Sino-Japanese War, Most U.S. Congressmen Tend to Sanction Japan, Various Chinese Universities Urge the U.S. Not to Aid Aggression</h3>
<p>New York: Former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson wrote a letter to the New York Times today, stating that in order for Japan to recognize the U.S.'s true feelings toward Japan, he advocated legislation to ban the export of arms, ammunition, and all raw materials that can be used for combat to Japan. "Only in this way can we show the world how much we value just international relations, especially respect for treaties and the integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Chinese territory. At the same time, it can make the Japanese understand that our claims are by no means a game for children." According to Stimson, U.S. merchants supply Japan with ore seedlings, scrap iron, scrap steel, kerosene, and other items. Although the number has been relatively small in the past three years, the U.S. State Department may be able to impose a mental embargo on these items. However, in order to make the Japanese understand the feelings of the American people on this issue, it seems that Congress should legislate to let Japan know the true attitude of the American people on this issue. This kind of expression from the U.S. will certainly enable Japanese militarists to abandon their current policies. If Japan's policies do not change, then the balance of power in East Asia, the balance of power that the U.S. is most concerned about and that is now threatened by Japan, will inevitably be unable to stabilize. Stimson also said that this policy of the U.S. can strengthen the excellent results since the abolition of the arms embargo. At the same time, it can show that the American people "inherently have the courage to clearly distinguish between right and wrong." Stimson continued that this bill of the U.S. will definitely not lead to war, because "war against the U.S. is what the Japanese government least wants." This can be clearly demonstrated by the fact that the U.S. declared the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which did not cause any trouble. Stimson also said, "At present, there are quite a few parties that hope the U.S. will come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, but these parties, if you seek common clues, are clearly Japan." He also said that what the U.S. is concerned about in the Far East is not just narrow commercial interests at present, but that it hopes that both China and Japan, and even the Soviet Union, can be independent of each other and not devour each other. As for the recent Japanese military force, it has become weaker, while China's self-confidence has become stronger, so he asked the American people to strictly reject the Japanese side's invitation for the U.S. to come forward to mediate, "because I deeply believe that this mediation work will not only be doomed to failure, but will also make the U.S. lose credibility with China and discredit itself in the Far East, because this move will completely abandon the principles that the U.S. has strived to uphold in the Far East for half a century. Finally, the interests of the U.S. in the entire Far East region will suffer a serious blow." (11th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: After former Secretary of State Stimson wrote a letter to the New York Times advocating banning the transportation of arms and various raw materials to Japan, the newspaper recently published an article commenting on it, saying: "We believe that the vast majority of the American people share the same feelings as Mr. Stimson. In other words, the fact that Japan has launched an act of aggression against China without provocation is very obvious, and the tactics adopted by Japan are extremely crude, and its goal is clearly to plunder Chinese land and conquer the Chinese nation. We believe that before the U.S. individually prohibits the transportation of certain goods, such as gasoline and iron ore, to Japan, it should contact the governments of other countries to learn to what extent those countries are willing to cooperate with the U.S. in cutting off Japan's supplies, because after the U.S. bans the transportation of various goods to Japan, whether Japanese militarists will turn to other markets to obtain various items, and whether the other signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty are willing to support the U.S. in spirit in preserving China's territorial integrity. We must know the above two aspects." (11th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman stated again yesterday that before the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is abolished, he will temporarily not take action on the resolution to ban exports to Japan. Pittman also said that in the first meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, he did not mention the issue of U.S.-Japan relations. The meeting was of a secret nature and only involved the appointment of new diplomatic personnel, but Congress generally advocates implementing a ban on the transportation of military supplies to Japan. Even Republican Senator Kappa, who has always been known to be pro-Japanese, has changed his attitude of opposition and expressed sympathy for the case. In addition, Democratic Senator Swedenbar said that even if Japan respects the interests of the U.S. in China, he also advocates sanctioning Japan. He also pointed out that the people on the west coast of the U.S. unanimously oppose Japan's aggression in China. At the same time, the isolationists in the Senate still oppose the embargo on goods to Japan. (11th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The presidents of 22 Chinese universities (two-thirds of whom are American returnees) jointly sent a telegram to U.S. Vice President Garner and members of the U.S. Congress today, stating that if the U.S. continues to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan now, then its previous declaration of abolishing the commercial treaty will become a meaningless move. What is more, if the U.S. signs a new commercial treaty with Japan, Japan will become even more elated and intensify its aggression against China. As a result, it will inevitably force the U.S. to withdraw from the Far East. This kind of policy that only cares about immediate interests is incompatible with the broad vision of the U.S. government and people. In short, if the U.S. takes a tough stance, it will definitely deal a fatal blow to Japan's economic institutions and promote the collapse of Japan's military institutions.

<h3>Abe Cabinet Prepares to Resign, Submits Resignation After Approving the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, The Military Prefers Konoe as the Successor Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, according to the Daily News, there will be the most important developments in the political situation on the 14th or 15th. Abe has given up the idea of dealing with the parliament with a tough attitude because he sees that the intentions of politicians with status in the military and political circles are becoming worse. Abe will attend a Privy Council meeting on the 13th, at which time the protocol of the provisional Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement will be submitted for discussion. That afternoon, the heads of the five major political parties will be invited to a meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence to report on the government's basic political program toward China (the new regime). The Asahi Shimbun summarized the achievements of the three cabinets of Konoe, Hiranuma, and Abe, and criticized the important political figures, saying that the powerful cabinet (unanimously supported by the whole country) that they organized was only in name. They hoped that they would be able to form a powerful cabinet with a firm determination and with the greatest strength this time. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, all the newspapers said that Prime Minister Abe will resign and step down after the Privy Council approves the provisional Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement on Saturday. If Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa and Privy Councilor Konoe can find a successor who can be accepted by the army, navy, political circles, financial circles, and business circles, then Abe's resignation will be submitted on Sunday or Monday. The Asahi Shimbun mentioned this matter and said that all relevant parties, including senior politicians close to the Emperor and military and political circles, now have their own hopes and are making their own speculations, which is very chaotic. Before these hopes and speculations are unified, all kinds of ups and downs are inevitable. It is expected that a special cabinet meeting will be held on January 15, at which time Abe will express his determination to resign. According to the speculation of informed sources, the new prime minister may be a retired soldier, but it is also possible for a current officer to take on the work of forming a cabinet. The responsibility for recommending a new prime minister to the Emperor now rests with Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa, but he may still need to consult with elder statesman Saionji. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: As the issue of a new beginning in the political situation becomes increasingly urgent, the actions of Prince Konoe, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa, and Lord Haraa Kumao have suddenly become more active. From the military's point of view, after a new beginning in the political situation, Prince Konoe is the only one who can solve the problems, so Prince Konoe's assumption of office is the most appropriate. All parties are paying close attention to this at present. (11th Allied Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Intensifying Internal Strife Between Japanese Military and Civilian Factions; Japanese Army in North China Opposes the Puppet New Regime</h3>
<p>Manila: The "Manila Bulletin" commented today that the Japanese army in North China has hinted at its opposition to the "new central government" headed by Wang Jingwei, indicating an intensification of internal strife between the Japanese military and civilian factions regarding the war in China. If the Japanese army, or influential elements within it, openly oppose the "Wang regime," then the "Wang regime" will certainly not last. News from Beiping further proves that the attitude of the North China army towards the Tokyo authorities is becoming increasingly independent or resistant. The attitude of the North China army will increase the difficulty of establishing a "Wang regime" under the control of Tokyo and will ultimately lead to the failure of this effort.

<h3>Hong Kong Sales of National Savings Certificates to Include Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Since the promotion of the National Construction Savings Certificates issued by the Chinese government in Hong Kong last year, the results have been quite remarkable. It has been learned that the Hong Kong authorities have notified the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau that, starting immediately, each certificate must have a stamp duty of one dime affixed. There are no restrictions on the redemption of principal and interest; upon maturity, certificate holders can apply to post offices in the mainland for redemption. (Dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on British and German Navies</h3>
<p>The British Navy currently has eleven battleships, three battlecruisers, thirteen heavy cruisers, forty-eight light cruisers, six aircraft carriers, two hundred and fifteen destroyers, fifty-six submarines, and three hundred and eighty-six other vessels, for a total of seven hundred and thirty-eight ships. Its primary mission is to protect Britain from enemy invasion, its second mission is to blockade Germany, and its third mission is to counter German warships and submarine attacks and protect Britain's maritime shipping.</p>
<p>Since 1652, the British Navy has not been defeated once. Historical British naval admirals such as Hawkins, Drake, Blake, and Howe are still admired by naval officers. Admiral Nelson, who defeated Napoleon, is revered as a sacred figure. British naval officers are familiar with the ocean and skilled in navigation, far surpassing naval officers of any other country in the world. This is the result of centuries of dedicated training. British naval officers are tenured for life, receive strict training, and emphasize book knowledge over creative ability. This is the so-called "Dartmouth System." Dartmouth is the only school in Britain that trains naval officers, selecting forty-five students at the age of thirteen each year. Each student's parents must guarantee that their child will pursue the navy as a lifelong career; failure to do so will result in a significant fine. Each prospective student is disqualified if they are missing seven or more teeth, have teeth that cannot be repaired, suffer from enuresis, or are too obese. The curriculum includes mathematics, science, engineering, French, English, history, and geography. They must also study the Bible and navigation for two hours each week. They must wake up at 7:00 AM every day and live at Dartmouth for three years and eight months, remaining a student until the age of twenty. Approximately three-quarters of British naval officers of the rank of colonel and above are graduates of Dartmouth. There have been slight changes recently; the Admiralty now selects one hundred seventeen-year-old students from various public schools as students each year, but the conservatism of the naval officer school remains.</p>
<p>The problems faced by the British Navy are different from those of other countries. The navies of other countries only need to protect one country, while the British Navy must protect almost half the globe. Its warships cannot be far from naval ports. British naval strategy focuses on concentrating the majority of warships in areas of dangerous weather to respond effectively. British warships are constructed to be able to operate anywhere in the world. While the combat power of each ship may not be as great as that of any other country, they often prevail through numerical superiority.</p>
<p>British general policy is often economics-oriented, and in peacetime, it is unwilling to easily increase the burden on the people by expanding the army and navy to enhance national prestige. It was not until 1935, after Italy annexed Abyssinia, that it awoke and rushed to build warships. Currently under construction are at least five aircraft carriers, hundreds of destroyers and light cruisers, and nine battleships, including five of 35,000 tons and four of 40,000 tons, each equipped with 14-inch and 16-inch guns. In addition, two more battleships have also been ordered.</p>
<p>As for German warships, they have historically aimed at guerrilla warfare. In the last European war, they sank 246 British warships and 815 auxiliary ships. Merchant ships were sunk at an average of 60 ships (250,000 tons) per month. The most famous at the time was the light cruiser Emden, which, under the command of the late Admiral Spee, attacked British commerce in the Indian Ocean with great success, bringing British shipping, especially in the Bay of Bengal, to a complete standstill. In addition, during the last European war, approximately ten armed cargo ships disguised as merchant ships attacked the shipping of the Allied powers. Only two completed their missions and returned home safely. One famous ship was the "Wolf," which slipped out of the Kiel naval port in 1916 and roamed the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans for fifteen months. The Allied warships were helpless, making it the most mysterious and unpredictable adventure in modern history. In this European war, Germany is still using the same strategy to counter the superior navies of Britain and France. However, the biggest problem with this kind of naval guerrilla warfare is the supply of fuel and food. The German naval authorities must have a precise plan for this matter, but how long it can be sustained remains to be proven. – A glimpse of the British Fleet from American Life and Reader's Digest magazines.</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Active at Sea; Two British Ships Sunk; Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over North Sea; German Aircraft Flying to British East Coast Repulsed</h3>
<p>London: As a result of German air attacks yesterday, the British merchant ships "Oakland" (1,895 tons) and "Upminster" (1,013 tons) were sunk. "Northburn" (1,146 tons) was also attacked. The number of casualties on the "Oakland" is not yet known, but it is believed that 20 crew members have landed. The "Upminster" was attacked in the North Sea, and the captain and two sailors are feared dead. Ten of the thirteen crew members survived, including two seriously injured. They landed at a port on the east coast last night. The ship's second mate was also among the survivors and described the situation of the attack by two German planes: "The German planes swooped down, first with machine guns, then with bombs, frequently attacking us. The ship was not equipped with cannons or wireless." Other survivors also said that when they fled to the lifeboats, the German planes swooped down on the deck and strafed with machine guns, and when the lifeboats rowed away, they were attacked again. The "Northburn" was attacked by two bombers off the east coast. According to the crew, the German planes dropped no fewer than 40 bombs on the ship, but all missed. They then strafed with machine guns, but no one on board was hit. It is reported that one German plane was hit near the wing by a Lewis machine gun on the "Northburn," and both planes flew away. It is also reported that the Danish ships "Ivan Frotrup" (2,396 tons) and "Ferdie" (955 tons), which were previously reported sunk by German planes, are still floating and can hopefully be towed into port.

<p>London: A squadron of British aircraft flew into the North Sea yesterday for reconnaissance and encountered several German long-range fighters, resulting in a chase battle lasting half an hour. According to the Air Ministry, a Messerschmitt Bf 110 German aircraft was seen crashing into the sea, and another German aircraft was forced to land in Denmark. One British aircraft was lost, but the remaining British aircraft continued their eastward reconnaissance after repelling the enemy aircraft and safely returned. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<h3>US Decides Not to Detain Crew Members of Self-Sunk German Mail Ship</h3>
<p>New York: The United States has decided not to detain the crew members of the German mail ship "Columbus" (32,565 tons), which has already been scuttled. Preparations have now been completed to send 400 crew members of military age back to Germany via San Francisco, Japan, and Siberia. Approximately 150 people of non-military age will be temporarily detained on Ellis Island, waiting to board neutral ships to cross the Atlantic and return to their country. The "Columbus" was the third largest German merchant ship. On December 19, to avoid encountering or being captured by Allied warships outside neutral waters, it was scuttled off Cape Henry, Virginia, USA. The crew was rescued by the US destroyer "Tuscaloosa." (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>France Reaffirms Determination to Fight to the End; Peace Can Only Be Discussed After Restoring Trust; Herriot Speaks in the Chamber of Deputies</h3>
<p>Paris: The Chamber of Deputies continued its meeting this afternoon. Speaker Herriot, representing the newly elected Presidium, delivered a speech reaffirming the determination to fight to the end. His words were as follows: "That ridiculous dictator, who is attempting to relive the dreams of Frederick II and Peter the Great, is actually accusing us of being imperialists. Isn't that ridiculous? The goals of Britain and France in this war, as US President Roosevelt said on the 3rd of this month, are to uphold freedom, conscience, moral laws, and the most progressive political systems of mankind, namely democracy. However, war has not yet occurred on French territory, thanks to the strength of the British and French armies and the expeditionary forces of the British Empire's autonomous territories. We must still strengthen our rear defenses, just as we have strengthened our front-line defenses, because the enemy is currently working to alienate our country's rear populace. We must guard against this and prevent all enemy propaganda from entering the country. As for our country's peace goals, they are nothing more than the following: (1) To stabilize the international situation, (2) To establish international law based on past lessons, (3) To ensure that all countries can meet their legitimate needs in the future through normal and peaceful means, (4) To revive moral concepts and ensure that the world recognizes that there can be no true civilization without respecting promises. In short, international law must be based on moral laws and supplemented by appropriate security systems to be effective. As for the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish nation is currently fighting bravely. The country's victory is in fact a victory of spirit over matter, a victory of human values over violence. Therefore, whether for moral or for practical reasons, we must do everything we can to help them." (Havas dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<h3>British-Soviet Relations Hanging by a Thread; Ambassador Seeds Unlikely to Return to His Post; British Government to Publish White Paper Describing Failure of Trilateral Negotiations</h3>
<p>London: The British, French, and Soviet governments conducted negotiations last spring to negotiate a mutual assistance treaty, which was unsuccessful. To clarify the truth to the world, the British government has compiled a White Paper containing various historical materials related to these negotiations, which will be published as soon as Parliament reconvenes on the 16th of this month. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>London: British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds returned home on leave and arrived here today. Political figures believe that the ambassador is unlikely to return to his post in the future. In his speech yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain referred to the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland as an "act of piracy." From this, it can be seen that unless the Soviet Union ceases its aggression against Finland, the current tense situation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union cannot be eased. As for the Soviet Union, according to various sources, it has decided to continue its use of force against Finland, regardless of the consequences. The question is, how long can the current relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be maintained? It is said that the Soviet Union, due to its unfavorable military situation, is unwilling to openly become hostile to Britain and France, especially since the possibility of reconciliation between Britain, France, and Germany has not yet completely disappeared. The Soviet Union does not want to act rashly and invite trouble. However, some people believe that since there is no room for compromise between Britain and France and Germany, it is possible that Germany and the Soviet Union will eventually form an alliance treaty. As indicated by Soviet official figures here, the Soviet government will "try its best" to maintain neutrality regarding the Western Front war, but the situation would be different if the assistance of Britain and France to Finland is tantamount to open intervention. It can be seen that the country's attitude currently still leaves room for maneuver. As for British officials, although they have said in the past that Britain should assist Finland as much as possible within the scope permitted by neutrality, this kind of reservation is no longer seen today. In other words, it can be asserted that Britain and France will in the future provide substantial assistance to Finland to the extent permitted by their own surplus military strength, without other concerns. As for the methods of assistance, there are only two: one is to sell military supplies to Sweden, and then Sweden will use them to supply Finland; the other is to directly transport military supplies to Finland through the Scandinavian peninsula countries. Although Germany previously threatened Sweden, forcing it to prevent military supplies from being transported to Finland through its territory, it did not succeed. Now that the Swedish government knows that if Germany and the Soviet Union dare to invade, Britain and France will definitely not stand idly by, it will certainly be even less concerned about this kind of threat.

<h3>Large Soviet Army Assembled on Northeastern Finnish Front; To Attack Finnish Positions Again</h3>
<p>London: Finnish sources in London claim that a large Soviet army has assembled in the areas of Salla and Lake Kiantajärvi, in astonishing numbers, and is expected to attack Finnish positions again soon. According to recent Finnish communiques, the Karelian Isthmus was relatively calm yesterday, with only artillery and patrol activities. It is reported that the Soviet army is still strengthening its defenses. Finnish troops on the Suomussalmi front have advanced to the border, clearing the Soviet army from the area. This is the fourth location where Soviet troops have been driven back into Soviet territory after crossing the border. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet army began an offensive near Ruhtinaansaari on the 9th, and the fighting north of Lake Ladoga has intensified. According to Finnish sources, the Soviet army has a large number of reinforcements, attempting to compensate for the defeat in the Suomussalmi area. According to military observers, the Soviet army on the Karelian front is digging trenches and consolidating its positions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a communique issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no significant developments on the front yesterday, except for artillery fire and reconnaissance activities in some areas. At the same time, due to inclement weather, the Soviet Air Force only conducted reconnaissance flights. (TASS dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Belgian military expert General Balthazar, who went to Finland last April to assist the Finnish government in building fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus, has returned here and praised the Finnish army's bravery and skill. As for the Finnish defenses, new-style bunkers have been built everywhere, making it impossible to cross the line. In addition, the Mannerheim Line is densely covered with barbed wire and obstacles. When the enemy attacks, the Finnish army fires machine guns when they approach within 200 meters, causing heavy casualties and making it impossible for the enemy to advance.

<h3>Britain and France to Order 10,000 Military Aircraft from US in Next 18 Months; To Achieve Absolute Air Superiority Over German Air Force; US Aircraft Production Now at Peak</h3>
<p>Washington: Allied procurement officials in the US are currently discussing aircraft orders for delivery in 1940 and 1941. Therefore, it is expected that US-made aircraft, especially bombers, will fly across the Atlantic to Britain and France in large numbers, far exceeding Germany's claimed air superiority. It is reported that Allied procurement officials have stated to the US aviation industry that at least 10,000 more US aircraft must be obtained in the next 18 months. Although US officials have not made any comments, it is reported that the aviation industry believes that the number of 10,000 is quite accurate. Britain and France have currently ordered 2,010 warplanes and may order another 3,300 this year. This is approximately the limit of the US manufacturing capacity. However, in early 1941, US manufacturers will definitely be able to supply the Allies with 1,000 aircraft per month. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Italy Resolves to Back Hungary with All Its Military Strength; Seeking Fair Resolution of All Issues Based on the Spirit of the Venice Talks</h3>
<p>Budapest: The "Pesti Lloyd" commented on the Italian-Hungarian talks in Venice, stating, "Italy and Hungary now share weal and woe, and the world knows that Italy is backing Hungary with all its military strength." The newspaper also stated that all issues of major concern to Hungary must be resolved in a fair spirit, but Hungary will choose a time to handle them. This is not only in the interest of Hungary but also in the interest of all of Europe. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>London: According to a wireless broadcast from Rome to New York received here, Italy has undertaken to provide military support to Hungary in the event that Hungary is threatened by Soviet aggression. At the same time, Hungary has agreed to temporarily shelve its claims to Outer Transylvania, in view of the fact that the threat of communism is of more immediate concern than the Outer Transylvania issue. However, it is believed that if Finland can continue to resist, the threat of communism felt by Hungary will not become acute. Outer Transylvania was formerly part of Hungary and was ceded to Romania after the Great War. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency reports from Budapest that Hungarian officials have categorically denied reports that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will soon visit Italy again to continue discussions with Italian political leaders. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>German-Dutch Border: Political Kidnapping - According to the Testimony of Two Englishmen, Germany is Preparing a Report</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - The secret police, led by Himmler of Germany, are currently drafting a report based on the "shocking testimony" of two Englishmen, Stephens and Best, who were secretly kidnapped on the Dutch-German border on November 8th of last year. This report is intended to respond to the Dutch protests regarding the border kidnapping incident. The content of the report is currently kept secret, but according to Berlin's hints, it contains "shocking events that would horrify the Dutch." It is reported that the two Englishmen are currently residing somewhere in Berlin, in good health, but are still being interrogated. It is understood that the two Englishmen traveled from the Netherlands to Germany in a Dutch car, hoping to contact Germany to explore the possibility of peace talks. However, before they entered the German border, they were kidnapped by the German secret police. At that time, Lieutenant Klopp of the Dutch military intelligence agency, who was traveling with the two Englishmen, was shot and killed by the Germans. Subsequently, a car drove out from the German territory, dragging the Dutch car, along with the driver, the two Englishmen, and the deceased Dutch officer, into the German territory.

<h3>US Fortification of Guam Arouses Japanese Resentment: This Case Will Become a Focus of Debate in the US Congress</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: A spokesperson for the Ministry of the Navy, in response to an interview with foreign reporters, claimed that the new US naval plan, which aims to increase US naval power by 25%, is being watched by all countries, and Japan is no exception. The United States' intention is clearly to maintain its superior ratio over Japan even after the dissolution of the Washington Treaty. The Japanese navy cannot ignore this. When asked whether Japan would create a new ship plan to counter the US plan if it were passed by the US Congress, the spokesperson replied that if such a situation occurred, Japan would be extremely concerned about the US naval plan, and one could imagine the actions it would take. The British reporter immediately suggested that, in order to avoid an arms race, it would be best for the naval powers to exchange information on shipbuilding with each other. The spokesperson said that the method proposed by the reporter might be effective, but Japan could not exchange such information with other countries. Regarding the US plan to build a 52,000-ton warship, the spokesperson said that this morning's editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan had automatically decided to open the Yangtze River below Nanjing, but the United States responded by announcing a plan to build a 52,000-ton giant ship. The spokesperson then humorously said that such a huge warship could not enter the Yangtze River. When asked about the exact date for the opening of the Yangtze River, the spokesperson replied that it was not yet possible to determine the exact date. The opening of the Yangtze River would depend on the local situation. When asked whether the date of the opening of the Yangtze River was related to the US attitude, the spokesperson said that the opening of the Yangtze River was a decision made by Japan independently.

<p>Washington - Vincent, Chairman of the US House Naval Affairs Committee, insisted yesterday that the Navy Department must obtain the approval of the House Naval Affairs Committee before using $4,000,000 to improve the naval facilities on Guam; otherwise, it must not use the funds. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, stated yesterday at his third appearance before the Naval Affairs Committee that the United States has the legal right to fortify islands in the Pacific under existing treaties. The United States considers the Nine-Power Treaty, which prohibits the fortification of islands in the Pacific, to exist only technically, as the treaty also guarantees China's territorial integrity. Stark continued that Japan took a better chess move than the United States by adding a clause to the Nine-Power Treaty prohibiting the fortification of Guam. He told the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that a 25% increase in US naval power cannot guarantee the safety of the United States against a combined attack by the Soviet Union, Japan, Italy, and Germany. The United States must prepare early for a "combined offensive" by the dictatorial countries against the Western Hemisphere. According to the current naval strength, we cannot defend southern Brazil while defending against attacks from both sides of the Pacific; therefore, we may have to temporarily sacrifice southern Brazil. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, delivered a speech yesterday to the House Naval Affairs Committee, stating that the Navy Department plans to request an appropriation of $4 million to improve the dock facilities on Guam in order to gradually establish naval and air bases on the island. It is generally expected that the issue of fortifying Guam will once again become the focus of debate in Congress. Last year, the House of Representatives voted 205 to 168 to reject the Guam fortification proposal. Although members of Congress still have divergent views on this matter, since Japan has continued to exclude US interests in the Far East in the past year, there will likely be fewer members of Congress opposing the fortification of Guam than before. It is generally believed that the government will not propose a special bill for the fortification of the island, but will include the fortification expenses in the budget of the Fourteenth Naval District of the Hawaiian Islands. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers have reacted strongly to the US naval shipbuilding plan. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun recently published an editorial stating that the US Navy still wants to force Japan to accept the unfair five-to-three ratio and wants to realize a strategy across the Pacific Ocean and control Japanese territorial waters. This is intentionally provocative. "In short, if the United States ignores Japan's peaceful naval plan and still wants to maintain an unreasonable advantage, then Japan will have no choice but to expand its naval power to cope with this threat." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to a Japanese naval spokesperson, the US Navy's reconsideration of the Guam fortification plan is a very "unbeautiful" attitude. He also said that in the last Congress, the United States abandoned the plan. Currently, the US's new consideration of fortifying Guam is strongly opposed by Japan. The spokesperson further stated, "The recent appointment of former US Naval Commander Black as commander of the Fourteenth Naval District of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii is a sign of the United States strengthening its navy to deal with Japan. It is rumored that the United States may build a 50,000-ton battleship. This matter will not only concern Japan but also other countries." (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>National Government Plans to Send a Delegation to Burma</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government is currently considering selecting a delegation of 3,000 young men and women to go to Burma in early March of this year, following the suggestion of the recent Burmese goodwill delegation to China. It is reported that the delegation will include women's basketball and volleyball teams, as well as men's and women's theater groups. After arriving in Rangoon, they will have friendly matches with local young men and women. The theater groups will perform Chinese wartime life. Wang Zhengting, President of the Amateur Athletic Federation of the Republic of China, will lead the delegation. The trip will take about a month. The Burmese goodwill delegation also plans to send a similar delegation from Burma to China in the near future. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Secretariat of the China-Burma Cultural Association recently received confirmation that since the Burmese delegation returned to their country, the friendship between China and Burma has become even closer. The inaugural meeting of the China-Burma Cultural Association was held in Burma on January 5th, with over 400 people from China, Burma, and Britain gathering together, making it a grand occasion. One president and three vice presidents were elected. The president is U Ba Lwin, and the vice presidents are one each from China, Burma, and Britain, with Li Wenhan representing China. (11th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Military Spokesperson Claims Japanese Casualties Last Year Averaged 40,000 Per Month; Japanese Offensive Goals This Year Have No Possibility of Being Achieved</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, Chinese troops on the Hunan-Guangdong Railway south of Hubei, after capturing several stations along the line, entered Puchi on Tuesday and fought fiercely with Japanese troops all day. In the fierce fighting, two Chinese military barracks were burned down, and the Japanese troops were severely damaged. From this, it can be seen that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Japanese troops to maintain their position. Although the Chinese troops withdrew from Puchi that evening, fierce fighting continued in the eastern suburbs of Puchi until yesterday. On the Guangdong front, Japanese troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway continued to retreat. When retreating, Japanese troops used trucks. Japanese troops in northern Guangdong have been retreating south since the failure of the "Christmas Offensive." The current Japanese front line is north of Longmen and Conghua, that is, on the railway line 86 miles north of Guangzhou. On the Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, the Japanese side launched a new offensive, which is the twelfth offensive by the Japanese troops in that area. However, as of yesterday, the Japanese plan had failed again and was forced to retreat to the northwest of Zhongtiao Mountain. It is reported that the Japanese offensive against Zhongtiao Mountain was launched on January 7th, when they used aircraft and artillery to show their power, but the result was still a failure. According to the Chinese military spokesperson's prediction, even if the Japanese side still has offensive goals in the military this year, there is no possibility of achieving these goals. The Japanese troops advanced at a very high speed in 1937, which decreased sharply in 1938, and there was almost no talk of advancing in 1939. Entering this year, all their offensive goals will become "desirable but unattainable." In the past year, the Japanese side has increased its troops in China by as many as eleven divisions, but the Japanese troops still suffered great defeats in central Hubei, northern Hunan, Zhongtiao Mountain, and northern Guangdong. Also, in the past year, the Japanese side only achieved two victories: the capture of Nanchang and the capture of Nanning. At the same time, in the past year, the Japanese army's monthly casualties were 40,000. The Japanese troops currently in North China, Central China, and South China number no less than one million, all stationed between various points and lines, unable to move. Therefore, in the new offensive after January 1st, the Japanese side can use no more than two or three divisions. As for the Chinese troops, since mid-December last year, they have entered Nanchang three times, Hangzhou once, Taiyuan once, and Guangzhou once. The number of times they have entered smaller cities is even countless. Because the Japanese troops are surrounded by enemies on all sides, they have no choice but to station more troops to maintain the security of the rear transportation. Also, in Yichang, an exhibition of war trophies is currently being held, including an exhibition of war trophies recently captured in the Han River basin. There are no less than 30,000 visitors.

<h3>Commercial Stagnation in Guangzhou City</h3>
<p>Guangzhou - Today, all Chinese businesses in the city have ceased operations because shop owners, merchants, and restaurants are not accepting Guangdong provincial banknotes, and the legal tender is now only worth 60% of the Japanese military scrip. In addition, exchange shops are unwilling to accept transactions that exchange Guangdong currency and legal tender for Japanese yen. As a result, the market is becoming increasingly chaotic. If the authorities do not quickly implement remedial measures, the Chinese people will soon be in a very difficult situation, as they will be unable to purchase rice and other daily necessities.

<h3>Japanese Troops Make All-Out Assault on Shaoguan; Three Routes of Japanese Troops Initially Arrive with Fierce Momentum; Chinese Troops Repel Japanese Troops After Reinforcements Arrive</h3>
<p>Shantou communication: Since the latter half of last month, Japanese troops have mobilized their forces stationed in Guangdong Province and launched an all-out attack on Shaoguan. The fighting is very fierce. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Three Routes of Japanese Troops Advance</p>
<p>The Japanese right wing, advancing north from Zengcheng, along the mountainous area of the Zeng River, numbers about 10,000 or more. The Japanese units on this route are the Nemoto, Horikawa, Kubo, Nakamiya, Tamura, and Koyama battalions. Chinese troops in that area are fighting from Longmen and Xinfeng. However, Japanese aircraft are wantonly bombing, forcing the Chinese troops to withdraw. On the 28th, the Japanese troops continued to advance northwest, but their rear was held back by our troops, who attacked them in the middle. The Japanese left wing, advancing north along the Yuehan Railway, on the left bank of the North River, includes the Matsuno, Nakano, Masaki, Hayashi, Ikeda, Ohashi, Sasaki, Ikuta, Yuya, and Kawaguchi units, numbering 30,000, arriving with fierce momentum. Artillery concentrated on firing shells, replacing rifles in the battle. Before dawn on the 28th, they used artillery to cover their crossing of the river, firing 2,000 shells per hour. The Sasaki, Nabeshima, Noguchi, and Matsuki Four Sky Squads (each squad with 1,200 or more men) crossed the right bank of the Beijiang River at Pa Zhukou and advanced towards Lyutianxu. On the 29th, over 1,000 Masaki Cavalry Artillery troops attacked Shatin. Seven hundred cavalry troops raided the Quan Shuikeng north of Shatin, firing 30 cannons fiercely at Da Shuikeng. Chinese troops also counterattacked with artillery. The fierce battle continued until the morning of the 31st and was still raging in Lyutian Da Shuikeng. The central route of the Japanese army, advancing from Conghua north to Wengyuan and Fogang, is the Ushijima, Kakuta, Tsuboi, Kasama, Fukahori, Morinaga, Fukuda, and Matsumoto Yoshida battalions, numbering about 10,000 or more. Chinese troops fought fiercely with the Japanese troops between Yingde and the south of Fogang, encircling each other. On the evening of the 28th, the battle shifted to Lianjiangkou. It was reported that Wengyuan had fallen. On the 29th, the Japanese Ping Tian and Nabeshima mountain combat corps reached the Chaziwei and Shatin areas of Xinfeng and engaged in bloody battles with Chinese troops again. There was also a sky battle north of Liangko圩. The Japanese troops fighting against Chinese troops were the Saga and Ishida units. On the 30th, the Japanese Sasaki, Koga, Noguchi, Masaki, and Nabeshima units attacked Lianjiangkou. At 4 p.m., Sasaki invaded Yingde City and a street battle broke out. On the 31st, in the battle situation in northern Guangdong, the Japanese right wing took a large encirclement, with the vanguard only 40 miles from southern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Japanese Casualties Exceed 30,000</p>
<p>Since New Year's Day, the elite troops of the Chinese side have rushed from southern Jiangxi to Xinfeng and Longmen, heading straight for the upstream of the Dong River to attack the right wing of the Japanese army. The strongholds lost ten days ago have been recovered one after another. On the same day, the Chinese air force dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. The Japanese troops who had sneaked into Yingde had already collapsed. The new forces of the Chinese side were sweeping towards Lianjiangkou in a whirlwind. The Japanese troops who had sneaked into Wengyuan County also suffered flank attacks and suffered heavy losses. The war vehicles and war horses abandoned on the mountain paths blocked the roads. On the 2nd, the Japanese army at Lianjiangkou retreated to Guantou and was also attacked on both sides by the Chinese army, breaking through the encirclement and fleeing south. A brigade of the Konoe Division guarded Liangko圩, covering the retreat of the Japanese army. Liangko was besieged by the Chinese army for four days, and the entire brigade was almost wiped out. According to military reconnaissance reports from Xingning, on the 24th of last month, the Japanese right wing adopted a large roundabout tactics, sneaking into Wengyuan via Zengcheng, Conghua, Longmen, and Xinfeng. The area along the way is a dangerous mountainous area, but it has always been taboo by military strategists, because the terrain in northern Guangdong is high in the north and low in the south. The Japanese army's move is equivalent to an uphill attack. In the ten days of fighting, there have been more than 40 battles, large and small, averaging three or four times a day with almost no rest. The Japanese right wing suffered about 4,500 casualties. On the 29th, in the battle on the outskirts of Wengyuan City, the main force of the Japanese army was detained by the Chinese artillery in Meikeng Huilong and could not pass. They changed their attack on Shilongtou and Shanghedong. More than 700 Japanese soldiers died. From the evening of the 31st to the morning of New Year's Day, the artillery of the Chinese side in Meikeng displayed its power. The Japanese army then detoured to Guihu, on the border between Wengyuan and Yingde. At Guantou and near Liulixu, they engaged in mixed battles with the Chinese defending army, repeatedly fighting in blood. The Chinese army never retreated. When reinforcements arrived at the front line one after another, they began to carry out a mopping-up operation from New Year's Day. Niu Bei Ridge Meikeng (between Wengyuan and Xinfeng), Fenshui Ao Zi Etan Baishiao (between Conghua and Zengcheng) and other strongholds were successively recovered. The casualties of the Japanese army this time were at least more than 30,000. Cannons, war vehicles, and military equipment were abandoned all over the road. The number of losses is countless. Therefore, the war situation in Guangdong Province has completely turned into a better situation.</p>
<p>The Miserable Situation of Japanese Aircraft Bombing in Henan Province (Continued) Zheng County, Luoyang, Xinyang, and Nanyang Suffer the Greatest Damage; Remote Rural Villages Are Also Difficult to Avoid Japanese Aircraft Bombing</p>
<p>C. Overview of Henan Province's Passive Air Defense and Air Raid Warning Facilities</p>
<p>(1) Warning Facilities: In Henan Province, Luoyang and Zheng County are larger cities with larger populations. Therefore, in addition to setting up electric and hand-cranked sirens, auxiliary sirens are also set up. Other counties, cities, towns, and villages also have warning equipment such as steel rails and cast bells. In addition, the air observation teams and sentries inside and outside the province are equipped quite tightly. Therefore, when Japanese aircraft attack, they can immediately issue warnings. Even the counties along the Longhai Railway, which are very close to the Japanese defense zone, have never missed a warning. When the alarm is issued, people can take refuge in time.</p>
<p>(2) Evacuation Facilities: Evacuation facilities are the guarantee for people's safety under air raids. The geology of Henan Province is solid and the water level is low. Digging air-raid shelters and air-raid trenches to avoid bombing has been very effective. Following the regulations of the air defense department, we have tried our best to supervise and order the administrative authorities in various places to mobilize members of the protection group and the police to dig widely. A total of 4,231 underground shelters have been completed. Air-raid trenches and wells are scattered throughout the cities, counties, and larger towns in the province. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, although the province has been bombed more than 500 times, the number of casualties has been relatively small.</p>
<p>(3) Protection Situation: In order to cope with Japanese aircraft bombing and reduce all the damage it causes, the protection organization is naturally the top priority. After careful planning and strict supervision by the air defense department, each city and county now has a protection organization. Even larger villages and towns also have protection groups. In the event of an air raid, each member of the protection group can work bravely in the tragic environment under the threat of Japanese aircraft. This is also one of the reasons for reducing damage.</p>
<p>(4) Enriching Firefighting: The brutal acts of Japanese aircraft have recently intensified, and they often drop incendiary bombs on various cities. The air defense department has seen this and has ordered the county governments to organize fire brigades one after another. The fire-fighting equipment of each team is also quite substantial. Currently, although there are incidents of Japanese aircraft dropping incendiary bombs in various parts of Henan Province from time to time, they can be put out in time, and the spread of fires is still rare.</p>
<p>(5) Evacuation Situation: Because the Japanese army has been unable to make military progress in recent years, it has turned to indiscriminately bombing defenseless cities in the rear of the Chinese army. In order to maintain the manpower and material resources for a long-term war of resistance, the Chinese authorities ordered the evacuation of the population and resources of the cities. After separate supervision by the air defense department, the counties of Henan have evacuated within a time limit and have achieved good results. In the future, when Japanese aircraft attack, although the loss of buildings is factually inevitable, it will not be easy to harm the people in the rear. (End)</p>

<h3>US Ambassador Will Arrive Next Week; Will Go to Hong Kong and Fly to Chongqing to See the Central Authorities; Did Not Meet with Kato for Discussions in Peking</h3>
<p>US Ambassador to China Dr. Johnson transferred from Chongqing to Hong Kong on the Coolidge President's ship at 9:00 p.m. on November 20th of last year and then met with Admiral Hart and Consul General Gauss on the US warship Augusta to discuss diplomatic and general issues in China. The meeting ended at 12:30 a.m. The ambassador stayed in Shanghai for only three days due to his daughter's fourth birthday. Therefore, he boarded the Kaiping ship of開　公司 (K Company) on the evening of the 23rd and went to Qinhuangdao to transfer to Peking. The ambassador once went from Peking to Tianjin on December 15th and held secret talks with the main American businessmen in that place for two hours in the afternoon. The ambassador did not meet with Japanese Special Envoy Kato in Tianjin. The rumor that the ambassador would hold some kind of meeting in Peking was denied. He then returned from Tianjin to Peking on the 17th. It was rumored in Shanghai that the ambassador could come to Shanghai, go to Hong Kong, and fly to Chongqing in the New Year. According to reliable sources, the ambassador will arrive here from Peking on the US transport ship Henderson on the 18th of this month. His family will remain in Peking and will not come with him. After the ambassador arrives in Shanghai, he will meet with US Consul General Gauss again, then board a boat to Hong Kong, and fly to Chongqing to pay his respects to the central authorities.</p>
<h3>French Concession Increases Various Taxes; Land Taxes Are Divided into Three Districts and Collected in Different Grades; Police Taxes Will Increase to 15%; Business Licenses for Freelancers Will Also Be Collected</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the budget for the current fiscal year of the French Concession has increased from 11,988,000 yuan to 16,800,000 yuan. Therefore, it has no choice but to increase revenue through taxes, licenses, and other methods to cope with the situation. The main reason for the budget increase is the low price of legal tender and the high value of imported materials. Therefore, since January 1st of this year, major revisions have been made in tax collection, especially land taxes and licenses for certain businesses and other places. In order to facilitate the collection of land taxes, the French Concession authorities have divided the concession into three districts: (1) From the Bund to Avenue Mentiigny, the land tax remains at 8 per thousand; (2) From Avenue Mentiigny to Avenue du Père Robert and Avenue de la Cathédrale, the land tax is changed to 9 per thousand; (3) The areas west of Avenue du Père Robert and Avenue de la Cathédrale, the land tax is changed to　per thousand. These taxes are still subject to a surtax of 1 per thousand. As for the house tax (commonly known as the police tax), it has increased from 13% to 15%, plus the current surtax of 2%, totaling 17%. The license fees for most commercial venues have also been adjusted. Starting from January 1st, ordinary business licenses for freelancers will also be collected. The license fees for cars and other vehicles have also been increased. Once the current budget is approved, it will be jointly handled with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. The defense tax implemented two years ago will continue to be collected as usual.</p>
<h3>Post Office Shooting of Foreign Constable Case – Chinese Constable Accidentally Fires Gun – Chinese Constable Feared Bowbede Would Shoot and Resist Arrest – Preemptive Strike Unexpectedly Injures Foreign Constable</h3>
<p>On the 10th at noon, inside the North Suzhou Road Post Office Administration, a dispute arose between the furnace room worker Weng Yongxing and Ma Ade, a worker from the Far East Cleaning Company, over boiling water, leading to a quarrel and physical altercation. This resulted in Foreign Constable 克蘭克, number 23 of the Public Concession Police Department, being shot in the abdomen. He is currently receiving treatment at the Country Hospital. Details have already been reported in the newspapers. Currently, the police department has detained the following two individuals in connection with the shooting: (1) Bowbede, manager of the Far East Cleaning Company, a Ningbo native, age 34; and (2) Shen Zhijing, a Chinese constable from Hebei, number 1289, who entered the post office with the foreign constable at the time, age 37. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police department's lawyer, Qian Juchiu, stated that the incident occurred because the price of coal near the furnace room inside the post office had skyrocketed. Therefore, workers from the Far East Cleaning Company, contracted by the post office to wipe windows and wash floors, were required to boil their own water outside the furnace room, except for the post office's own staff. At that time, Weng Yongxing, the furnace room manager, and seven workers from the cleaning company, including Ma Ade, Lin Youwei, and Wang Jinyu, engaged in a dispute while obtaining hot water, leading to a quarrel and physical altercation. Subsequently, the cleaning company foreman, the defendant Bowbede, arrived with a .25 caliber self-defense pistol licensed by the Public Works Department to question Weng Yongxing. Unexpectedly, a large number of workers inside the post office surrounded him. Bowbede, frightened and fearing violence, drew his .25 caliber pistol and fired a warning shot into the ground.

<h3>Grain – Flour Actually Opens at a High Price of 10 Yuan – Trading Suspended Yesterday Due to Buying and Selling Disputes – Flour Merchants Ultimately Get Their Wish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for flour was quite high. Although the base price for No. 2 flour was still 9.4 yuan, the sellers were actually offering the "Green Cannon" brand at a peak of 10 yuan. The price of flour selling at 10 yuan per bag is unprecedented, but there has been talk of this on the market for months, that flour would not be traded unless it reached 10 yuan. We were unwilling to publicize it in the newspapers, but now it has become a reality. The price of "Warship" and "Tian Zhu" brands was reduced by 1 jiao, but they still cost 9.9 yuan. Both the northern and southern merchants enthusiastically prepared for the New Year. The combined transactions before and yesterday totaled nearly 100,000 bags. There were also more than 10,000 bags of retail transactions on this street. Since the futures of Japanese-made flour have been heavily speculated on, the market has fluctuated like trading on the stock exchange. Yesterday morning, trading was suspended due to buying and selling disputes and would only resume after the matter was resolved. Furthermore, 4,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen today, and another 1,000 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat was consistently strong yesterday. Because the seller's price for flour had reached a peak of 10 yuan, the wheat market was also offering prices of 16 yuan beyond the border. However, Chinese factories considered the price too high and were unwilling to release more prices to buy. As a result, it was again presented to the trading bureau. It is reported that one lot of Changzhou wheat warehouse receipts was traded, with the price still at 16 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding miscellaneous grains and goods, 1,400 bags of beans, 5,300 bean cakes, and 1,556 bags of sesame seeds will be shipped to Xiamen today. Another 1,010 bags of beans and 2,180 bags of raw peanuts will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Flat</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply from the interior has been steadily flowing out of the Hongkou district. Various goods on the market have gradually become abundant. However, recently, a certain party has been monopolizing the market again, and there have been some problems with transferring goods from that district. Fortunately, the warehouse stocks are already plentiful, and the market is stable. Furthermore, the implementation of subsidized rice sales is imminent, which will inevitably have a slight impact on retail sales in stores. Therefore, the operators are unwilling to do much more. As a result, from morning to noon, the market has been flat. Among the intermediaries, there is no shortage of those holding goods with the intention of finding opportunities, but in the end, the other party's willingness to buy is also uncertain, resulting in few overall transactions, no more than 4,000 to 5,000 bags. As a result, the market prices are similar to those of the previous market.</p>
<p>After the arrival of a new batch of foreign rice, more is expected to arrive soon, and the subsidized sales will begin soon. Local shops on this street have significantly reduced their intake, and demand from rural customers has also weakened. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, it gradually weakened. High Saigon opened at 36.5 yuan, and high broken rice at 32.8 yuan. However, the orders telegraphed back to the station yesterday stated that No. 2 Saigon required 42.78 yuan, and No. 1 was even more difficult to clear. A parcel of broken rice on the road sold for 34.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities – Bond Market Rally Unabated</h3>
<p>The grey market for securities was fiercely contested by bulls and bears yesterday. The environment was bullish, and the bears appeared weak, leading to an expansion of the hedging operations. The bears specifically believed that in the previous two sessions, there would be rumors whenever the dividend payment was approaching, and since there was no need to borrow interest at the moment, they considered the news to be unfounded. The bulls relied on the fact that the semi-annual interest was included in the market price, making it very suitable for investment. Therefore, the trend was to increase rather than decrease. Class E bonds even broke through the 50 yuan mark, and various other bonds also reached their recent high prices. Even if there are changes in the future, it feels easier to rise than to fall. Yesterday morning, trading was quiet, with little difference between buyers and sellers. Most purchases were small, and sales were mostly large. However, the market price was slightly firmer than before. In the afternoon, Jiu Feng covered short positions, and Eleventh and Daqing were bought aggressively. Maotai Lianyi had frequent ins and outs, Jiu Fu had slightly increased long positions, and prices gradually rose again. Class E bonds briefly broke through the 5.10 yuan mark, the most recent new price. As a result, it turned up from 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. The total volume of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of 57 yuan.</p>
<p>The British-owned 别发洋行 of this port decided at yesterday's board meeting to distribute an interim dividend of 0.5 yuan per share (國幣) for the year ending February 29, 1940 on January 23.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of the Zhongye Public Institute opened in the afternoon with good buying interest. The trends of Shanghai Silver Company shares and Ewo Cotton Mills shares were particularly strong, trading mutually at prices of 15.6 yuan and 31.5 yuan. Rubber shares continued to be very firm. Although trading was slightly light, buying interest surged as soon as prices fell slightly.</p>
<p>London, 10th - Today, the stock market listings of British-owned Far East companies were generally flat. Only Gulac Klinbang Rubber shares rose sharply by 1 shilling 3 pence, with the price at 23 shillings 1 and a half pence.</p>
<p>London, 10th - Today, the listing prices of Chinese foreign debts have ceased to rally. Only the Hukwang 5% loan and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway loans continued to rise by 1 pound. The Hukwang 5% loan was 19 pounds, and the Tianjin-Pukou loans were 16 pounds. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>8.03125, causing the U.S. exchange rate for that month to be 8 yuan. The sentiment caused difficulty in finding buyers. Afterwards, it was quiet for a long time. Around 11:00, however, the foreign banking community suddenly aggressively bought U.S. exchange rate current goods at 8 yuan, so the market suddenly became tighter. Before long, Sassoon also aggressively bought British Gold for the current month at 4s8.4375d, while another bank also absorbed U.S. exchange rate current goods for the same month at 7.96875 yuan. The situation stabilized at noon. By the close of the market, the selling prices of the banks' current goods were British Gold at 4s8.4375d and U.S. exchange rate at 7.6875 yuan, which was British Gold at 0.015625d tight and U.S. at 0.03125d soft compared to the opening prices that morning.</p>
<h3>Finance Uneven News of Bearish and Bullish Factors, Most Foreign Exchange Observers Remain Cautious</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the HSBC listing showed no change. In the grey market for British and American exchange, news reports mentioned interest rates, leading to both bearish and bullish possibilities. One report stated that the British Straits Settlements government had issued prohibitions and restrictions on the import of goods from non-British countries, which would inevitably affect Shanghai's exports. Another report claimed that the Abe cabinet in Japan was destined to fall, making the question of who would succeed him the focus of public speculation. However, because the truth of these reports was unclear, most operators remained cautious, waiting for the situation to clarify. Consequently, the day's fluctuations were narrow, trending first looser and then tighter. The final result was slightly softer than the previous day. The morning started flat, but then hardened due to the Hong Kong Electric Company and exporters selling. Foreign banks absorbed offers at 4/8 90625 and 8.125 yuan. At that time, 4/8 75 and 8.0625 yuan could have been closed out. However, sellers disappeared, and the market gradually returned to flat. At one point, it was difficult to close out U.S. dollars for the current month. Later, Huaxing Bank sold some, stabilizing the situation. Around 11:00 AM, a few scattered settlements occurred, and shortly after, Sassoon also purchased forward contracts. In addition, a certain American bank also had an appetite, so the market reversed and softened. By the close, only 4/8 84375 and 7.96875 yuan were reported. The afternoon situation was even more sluggish, with no changes until the late close. The price remained similar to the afternoon close, resulting in a slight tightening of 0.015625 and 0.03125. The trend for futures was the same as for spot.</p>
<p>Sassoon Closing Purchases of Current Month Futures</p>
<p>In the morning, London large bars rose by 125 points for both near and far months. New York silver prices remained flat. London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates for British pounds against U.S. dollars, Shanghai dollars, French francs, etc., were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell by half a point against the British pound, remained unchanged against Shanghai dollars, and was down slightly by 0.0375 against the French franc. Central exchange rates remained unchanged. The bank's opening spot selling prices were British gold at 4/8 85375 and U.S. dollars at 8 yuan, with no change from the previous day. After the opening, the Hong Kong Electric Company was the first to sell, and exporters also followed suit, causing the market to suddenly harden. It was estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company sold spot British gold at 4/8 890625 to foreign banks. Subsequently, exporters also sold spot U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger. At that time, foreign banks' selling prices were soliciting 4/8 875 and 8.0625 yuan. The HSBC listing was announced, remaining unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced at 0.75. After this, the selling wind subsided, and the market began to soften. At one point, it was difficult to close out U.S. dollars at 8 yuan for the current month. At that time, Huaxing Bank sold U.S. dollars for the current month at 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The Market Was Particularly Quiet in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Transactions were even quieter in the afternoon. Transactions were rarely heard for British exchange. Only a few sales of U.S. dollars to Chinese merchants were done for the current month at a price of 7.9375 yuan. The market situation was extremely quiet, with little fluctuation in prices. Extending to the late close, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 4/8 8475 and U.S. dollars at 7.96875. The current month's prices were British gold at 4/8 828125 and U.S. dollars at 7.9375. The following month's prices were British gold at 4/8 765625 and U.S. dollars at 7.8125. As a result, compared to the previous day, the current period for British exchange was tighter by 0.015625, while U.S. dollars were softer by 0.03125.</p>

<p>No Major Fluctuations in the Gold Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the grey market situation for spot gold showed no activity throughout the day, with minimal fluctuations. This was because the exchange market's changes were narrow, and trading was slow. The situation changed from weak to firm due to the exchange market being first loose and then tight. The initial opening showed a decrease of 8 yuan, to 4,070 yuan. This was because the exchange market reported loosening, and silver shops were selling, along with some cash shops. This pushed the price down to a low of 4,070 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the exchange market softened, and a certain money exchange also bought a significant amount, raising the price to 4,081 yuan. The closing price was 4,080 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial opening was weak because a money exchange lowered the price and sold, and buyers were temporarily waiting. This forced the price down by 10 yuan. Later, a certain silver firm took advantage of the low price to buy over 200 taels for customers, raising the closing price to 4,081 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 3 yuan, and the total trading volume decreased to only 600-700 taels. Silver jewelry remained stable. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rebounds by 3 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels), the initial opening was that the exchange market hardened, and silver shops came to sell, causing the market to open down 8 yuan. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a securities shop for 4,070 yuan. Shortly after, gold shops took advantage of the low price to buy in, and the exchange market stopped loosening and returned to flat. Soon, a certain money exchange followed suit and bought in, gradually raising the price. A gold shop purchased 20 taels from a securities shop for 4,080 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops and cash shops sold together, and buyers' appetite weakened, causing the price to fall again. A cash shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange for 4,070 yuan. After this, the market was quiet for quite some time. Around 11:30 AM, the exchange market reversed and tightened, triggering a buying wind. A certain money exchange again aggressively bought over 100 taels, raising the price by 10 yuan. Then, a certain silver firm purchased 10 taels from a securities shop for 4,081 yuan. Later, a securities shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange for 4,080 yuan as the noon closing price. The initial opening in the afternoon was weak, and a certain money exchange lowered the price and sold. Buyers were temporarily waiting, causing the price to be forced down by 10 yuan. A money exchange sold 10 taels to a securities shop for 4,070 yuan. Afterwards, a certain silver firm saw the low price and bought over 200 taels, gradually raising the price. A certain silver firm and money exchange each purchased 10 taels from a money exchange for 4,081 yuan as the late closing price. As a result, the price rebounded by 3 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was only 11 yuan. The wood-panel gold prices of existing money shops are higher by several yuan, and purchases are reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold prices are lower than the listed gold prices by over 50 yuan. There is little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Still Holds Original Price</p>
<p>The exchange price for silver jewelry per tael has not changed throughout the day. Da Tong Hang still lists 410 yuan. Xin Tong Hang has the same price. Purchases are reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Notes Show Only Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were stable. The supply and demand for British and American gold pounds was not strong, and market prices did not change. British and American gold notes initially showed no difference. Transactions gradually increased in the afternoon. Because the pound price was strong, U.S. dollar notes alone declined. The evening price was 12 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes absorbed small amounts, and market prices were slightly firmer. Annam notes were scarce, and market prices were slightly higher. The demand for Japanese gold notes trended smoothly, and market prices were slightly better. The evening price was 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 fen, and 7 li. Korean notes were sluggish, and the evening price remained at 1 yuan and 5 fen. Yesterday's market prices were British gold notes up 2 jiao, U.S. dollar notes down 4 fen, Hong Kong notes up 1 fen, French franc notes up 5 li, Annam notes up 2 fen, and other currencies unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate From High to Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts started high and ended low. The initial price was as high as 33.5 yuan per thousand yuan, but it soon fell back down. At noon, it was 32.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it retreated further to 32 yuan, a decrease of another 1 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 1 jiao and 5 fen for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales are Declining, Yarn Prices are Falling Daily</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the falling trend intensified. This was because actual demand was too weak, leading to an increase in inventory for domestic merchants. In addition, the amount of yarn released by factories was very large, and payments were due, making it inevitable to clear out inventory. At the same time, exchange rates were at a stable level, further dampening the enthusiasm of speculators. In this situation, it was difficult for long positions to remain stable. Many short positions were being closed out. However, large players such as a certain company were still unwilling to close out their positions, and the market was still developing.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning with little activity. Although various parties tried hard to support it and shouted loudly, buyers lacked enthusiasm. 20-count Shuang Ma yarn opened at 723 yuan, down 3.5 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, there was news that exchange rates continued to rise, but the market remained firm, and efforts to tighten the market did not cease. The price fell slightly to 21 yuan. After support from long positions, it returned to 723 yuan. At this time, transactions were very thin. At the close, the price fell again. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,335 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 6 yuan, Tian Nv yarn fell by 6 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu yarn fell by 7 yuan. Today, 120 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below: Internal Trade: 1,250 bales; Hong Kong: 220 bales; Xiamen: 30 bales; Fuzhou: 10 bales; Tianjin: 10 bales; Mainland: 5 bales. Total: 1,335 bales.</p>
<h3>Quiet Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Trading in native cotton has become quiet. Trading among firms is also less active than in the past. Factory demand has also stagnated, and purchases have been sluggish. In reality, yarn sales have declined, inventories have increased, and the end of the year is approaching, leading to a weaker market sentiment. Arrivals from Northern Jiangsu include 4,476 bales of Tong Hua cotton, and 3,870 bales from Beisha. The current situation for native cotton is listed below: Huo Ji Hua cotton, 162.50 yuan, 180 bales purchased by firms; Huo Ji Hua cotton, 163.00 yuan, 200 bales purchased by firms; Changshu Hua cotton, 171.50 yuan, 100 bales purchased by firms; Bei Tai cotton, 169.50 yuan, 320 bales purchased by firms; Huo Mu Jia cotton, 160.00 yuan, 280 bales purchased by firms; Chong Tong cotton, 163.00 yuan, 175 bales purchased by firms; Huo Ji Hua cotton, 170.50 yuan, 2,000 bales purchased by Tong Yi Factory; Tong Hua cotton, 171.00 yuan, 200 bales purchased by firms; Tong Hua cotton, 172.00 yuan, 180 bales purchased by firms.</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market opened yesterday morning in a weak state due to selling by overseas cotton merchants. Later, due to purchases by industry peers and some short covering, the market turned firm. The closing price rebounded, and prices rose by 2-3 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures fell by five rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by over twenty pounds. The Liverpool market situation was relatively stable.</p>
<p>Trading in Shanghai's foreign cotton market has been quiet recently. However, there are signs of slight activity because exchange rates have been more stable recently, and industry peers are considering making purchases after a long period of inactivity. Japanese manufacturers have been inactive for a long time. It is generally predicted that they will start purchasing American cotton soon. The following are the mill prices for yesterday's cotton, converted at an exchange rate of 8 yuan per U.S. dollar: 20-count American middling cotton, 138.00 yuan; 20-count American middling low grade, 223.85 yuan; 32-count American cotton, 240.50 yuan; 32-count American middling low grade, 224.50 yuan; 42-count American cotton, 245.00 yuan; 42-count American middling low grade, 236.80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal is in Short Supply, Interbank Lending Rates Rise by Another 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the European War, Indian Calcutta bituminous coal has been difficult to obtain due to the long distance and soaring freight costs. Most importers are unwilling to take the risk, so there have been no arrivals in Shanghai for the past few months. The market has been relying on existing inventories. Although various docks in Pudong still have over 20,000 tons of old inventory, the owners are taking advantage of the recent shortage to drive up prices. Yesterday, interbank lending rates rose by another 5 yuan. Lump coal is 130 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 118 yuan. Transactions at the docks are for cash only, and only a few are willing to sell. On this street, Calcutta lump coal is 136 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 124 yuan. Delivered to customers, with transportation costs extra.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Fall, Local Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Japan and the United States continued to weaken. New York's near-term prices fell by one jiao, and long-term prices fell by one jiao. Japanese silk prices fell by 1 jiao and 4 fen each. Chinese silk fell by 1 jiao and 1 fen. Yokohama spot prices fell by 47 yuan, and long-term prices rose by 4 yuan. The local Shanghai silk market showed no signs of rising or falling, because foreign firms were unable to sell. There were continued transactions in Indian Chien Chin silk, priced at 1,820 yuan. Although it should be considered a high price compared to the previous market, overseas silk prices have fallen significantly recently (New York near-term prices have already fallen by over 2 jiao, and Yokohama has fallen by 120 yuan). Observing the trend of the silk market, it is unlikely to fall drastically. However, the market sentiment is weaker at present. In addition, 34 pieces of silk and 53 cases of tea were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chebai Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market remained soft. The association quoted prices. Spot 24 rough white and transit cargo called for the original prices unchanged. Taikoo Chebai continued to decline, varying from 3-5 jiao to 1 yuan. B-mark cargo was 58 yuan at the East Bund warehouse and 58.5 yuan at the West Bund warehouse. CW-mark cargo was 57.5 yuan, 57 yuan at the East Bund warehouse, CW-mark cargo was 57 yuan at the West Bund warehouse, DY-mark was 56.7 jiao, HX-mark was 56.5 yuan. Dutch red base cargo was 45.5 yuan. Local white and first-grade ice maintained original prices. Not much domestic sugar was offered. Guangbang offered Huizhou lower white at 80-odd packages, 52 yuan. Jianbang offered Quanzhou foreign at 60 packages, 48 yuan, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Spring Woolens are Already Being Sought on this Street</h3>
<p>Winter woolens, which should be in season, have limited actual sales. This is because the Gregorian calendar year-end has passed, and the Lunar New Year is approaching soon. Therefore, market sales continue to decline. However, the current selling prices of general merchandise have mostly increased. This is because there is concern that future arrivals will be lacking. Thin woolens, broadcloth, serge, Walter cloth, pallace, flannel linen, and rubber cloth, which are needed for spring and summer sales, are mostly being collected by industry peers. At the public tea meeting, only buying was heard, not selling, which shows that woolens are in high demand. It is unprecedented in the woolen industry for spring and summer goods to be bought and sold so early on this street. In addition, 257 pieces of cloth were shipped to Xiamen today, and 13 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: White Mustard Seed Arrivals and Inventory are Scarce</h3>
<p>White mustard seed originates from Tianjin. Lately, the amount arriving is scarce. Guangzhou merchants purchase frequently. Its momentum is increasing daily. The previous market opened at 35 yuan, but the current market price is 40 yuan. Inventory is thin, so if no more arrives, the outlook is still good.</p>
<h3>Chao Yun Production Not Abundant</h3>
<p>Bai Zi, also known as Chao Yun (raw material for small green tangerine peel), had a batch arrive previously and sold for 55 yuan. It was from Shantou. Recently, goods from Fujian arrived, but the quality was lower, so they only sold for 35 yuan. However, oily goods have a high status and production is not abundant, inventory is also scarce in the market and will not be affected by lower prices of goods from Fujian. Therefore, the future market is still stable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xiang Lotus Seed Expensive</h3>
<p>Xiang lotus seed has been scarce recently, and market prices have continued to tighten. Local lake lotus seed has increased by 5 yuan, and the street sells it for 165 yuan. Even ordinary Raozhou lotus seed with lower quality sells for 155 yuan. Lower-grade lake lotus seed is 85 to 80 yuan. White lotus seed arrivals and inventory are both low, and the street sells it for 175 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yue Zhi Number Prices Decreased</h3>
<p>Not much gold mountain branch has been arriving recently, the market is weak and loosening. Yesterday, the north city number opened a new ordinary Yuan branch for 107 yuan, old Yuan branches were less than 100 yuan, glutinous rice branches continued to decline, only selling for slightly above 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Reasons for High Prices in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Besides grain and local produce, most other goods are very expensive in Ningbo. For example, inferior white sugar, which was 2 jiao per jin before the war, now costs almost 1 yuan. Other examples include yellow sugar at 6 jiao per jin, yarn (Hero brand) at 9.5 yuan per pound, socks at 6-7 jiao per pair, raw soybean oil at 1.2 yuan per jin, kerosene at 7 jiao per jin, matches at 5 fen per box, solid soap at 2.5 jiao per bar, white paper at 40-50 yuan per ream, and iron nails at 1.4 yuan per pound. These have all increased several times compared to before the war. The reasons for the high prices are twofold: (1) the Zhenhai port is blockaded, making transportation difficult; (2) since Wuhan fell, merchants and residents from the interior have been rerouting to Ningbo, especially those from Chongqing and Kunming, so as soon as goods from Shanghai arrive, they are immediately bought out, and local residents cannot obtain them. Due to these reasons, prices in Ningbo have had to rise. (Tao)</p>

<h3>Employment Situation of Graduates from Colleges and Universities Last Year, 2,700 Were Employed</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The employment situation of graduates from colleges and universities is crucial to the future of the War of Resistance and national construction, and it is a matter of concern for people across the country. The Ministry of Education, in view of this, had coordinated the service and introduction of graduates from various universities in the 27th year (1938). This year, the Ministry of Education is planning to resolve the issue of graduates from colleges and universities by proceeding per last year’s method, and began planning in April. The plan first involved investigating the departments and approximate number of graduates from schools to be graduating this year, and then requesting the central and local government agencies to indicate the number of university graduates they could accommodate for internships or service in order to coordinate distribution. According to the results, there are a total of 5,276 graduates from colleges and universities nationwide this year. Approximately 1,700 graduates were directly introduced by the Ministry of Education and have obtained service opportunities. Their distribution includes: 1. Ministry of Communications, 2. Ministry of Economic Affairs, 3. Ministry of Military Affairs, 4. Ministry of Military Training, 5. Ministries of Military Affairs and Internal Affairs, 6. Sichuan Provincial Government, 7. Anhui Provincial Government, 8. Fujian Provincial Government, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Education has also selected dozens of outstanding graduates in literature, law, science, engineering, education, and other disciplines from schools this year and assigned them to serve as secondary school educators in border areas. The Ministry of Education will provide living expenses. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education has decided to send all 300-plus graduates from public colleges and universities in Shanghai to the rear to serve, and private school graduates who are willing to serve in the rear will also be assigned work as usual (the number of private school graduates is estimated to be over 700). The Ministry of Education will provide travel expenses for these students and send them in batches to designated locations to concentrate and await assignment. In summary, 2,700 graduates from colleges and universities in the 28th year (1939) have obtained service opportunities through the Ministry of Education's coordination, which is more than half of the total number of graduates from schools this year. The Ministry of Education is continuing to find ways to introduce and request central ministries and commissions and provincial governments that have not fully employed graduates to employ them as much as possible or provide them with internship opportunities. As for those who have directly obtained work through their schools or found employment on their own, the number is also not small. The Ministry has ordered schools to investigate the number of students who have not yet found employment in detail and provide them with assistance separately after the investigation is completed. It is expected that the employment issue for university graduates this year will be fully resolved.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football: Match Schedule Arranged: Three Days Next Month, the 8th, 9th, and 11th: Shanghai Team Selection to Be Discussed Next Week</h3>
<p>It is now confirmed that the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match will be held on the 8th of next month (the first day of the Lunar New Year). The second match will continue on the 9th (Friday), and the third match will be delayed until the 11th (Sunday). This is because the Yu Garden will add dog racing programs on Saturday afternoons starting in 1940, making it difficult to provide football matches. The Yu Garden stadium on Sundays is only available in the morning, so the third interport match must also experience the flavor of playing football at noon. As for the selection of Shanghai team representatives, according to the usual practice, three trial matches must be held before a decision can be made. Now, due to time constraints, only one can be held. However, the two charity matches held not long ago can also be used as a reference for the selection committee. As for the trial match, it will still be contested by the "Ideal" and "Possible" teams. Once the lineup is determined, a practice match will be held, and the opponents will be the elite players who were not selected for the interport team. The Westerners' Association has scheduled a discussion next Wednesday on all preparations, at which time some important steps can be decided.</p>

<h3>How Do We Organize a "Reading Club"?</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Currently, due to the soaring price of paper and the high cost of everything, the price of books in Shanghai is also much more expensive than before the war. Buying a magazine costs at least a few cents, and other items such as textbooks and photocopied Western books have all increased several times in price. What methods can we use to spend a small amount of money and read a large number of books, newspapers, and magazines? This question naturally lingers in our minds, and the organization of a "reading club" can be said to have been established under this question.</p>
<p>Three months ago, I first had the motivation to organize a "reading club." Indeed, the results obtained were very satisfactory. At first, only a few of my close friends served as the basic members of the "reading club." After about half a month, the number of members joining gradually increased, and the club's finances were also quite sufficient. At present, we can see a new book every month, and there are also more than ten kinds of magazines. I feel that "reading clubs" are really a necessary organization at present. In Britain, this kind of "reading club" is very common, and there are many members. Therefore, the impact on the cultural and educational circles is also very deep and great. In order to solve the difficulties of life, we must implement "consumer cooperation." Similarly, in order to solve the difficulties of reading, why don't we organize "reading clubs"?</p>
<p>At the beginning, I first wrote a letter-like thing to a few close friends:</p>
<p>"Sir: I am afraid you will not deny the current high price of books in Shanghai. Why don't we quickly organize a 'reading club'? Every month, when you move your salary, we may as well propose five cents or one yuan to join the 'reading club' as a member. After that, we can enjoy the right to read various books, newspapers, and magazines purchased by the club. Do you like reading? If you are happy, then please sign your name at the end. Also, what is your favorite magazine? What books do you most want to read? Here, in order to make it convenient for the club to buy books, I think it is also necessary for everyone to write down their favorite books they want to read."</p>
<p>The result was very good. We all agreed to set aside one yuan per month. As for the magazines purchased, there are currently eleven kinds, including Xifeng, Xifeng Supplement, Yuzhoufeng, Tianxiashi, Millard's Review Weekly, China Review Weekly, T'ien Hsia, China Jiurnal, Readers' Digest, Magazine's Digest, and Parade. The new book for the first month was Lin Yutang's Moments in Peking; the second month was the "Translation Collection" published by Xifeng Society; and this month it has also been scheduled to buy a "Mr. Jekyll" translated by Chuan Donghua, published by Commercial Press.</p>
<p>We also stipulate that magazines are changed every two days, and new books are limited to one week per person. Of course, at the beginning, not every member can have a new book to read. But I hope that we can have enough membership fees to purchase a large number of new books in the near future.</p>
<p>We are all comrades who like to read books, and we all have a common wish: that is, to make full use of our spare time to read books. We don't smoke, we don't play mahjong, we don't dance, and we don't run to theaters. We only hope that our knowledge can advance with the giant wheels of this era, and secretly make life more perfect, thus prompting our thorny society to gradually brighten up!</p>
<h3>Why Charge Make-Up Exam Fees?</h3>
<p>— Guo Sheng</p>
<p>To talk about make-up exam fees, we must first talk about make-up exams. The original intention of make-up exams: (1) Although the student's exam score is failing, it is not to the extent that he must repeat the course. Also, because the exam is a test of what has been learned on weekdays, it also contains a component of speculation, so it is specially allowed to try again; (2) If a student did not take the exam due to illness and it is verified to be true, it seems inappropriate to directly order him to repeat the course, so he is ordered to take the exam again. This kind of re-examination is called a "make-up exam." The original intention of make-up exams is like this, and the reasons for charging make-up exam fees are said to be "teachers correct exam papers twice, the school spends energy twice, and loses paper"; some say "make-up exam fees are used to punish students who retake the exam." I do not agree with the first saying at all. The teacher's spirit is to do his best to teach students to achieve the purpose of serving the people. If "one point of spirit, one point of wealth" seems too unreasonable; the school must charge for paper, this is the behavior of a store, which seems impossible for schools to adopt. The second saying is close to "imposing penalties on money," which is the rule for collecting taxes and the reason for the existence of tobacco and alcohol donations, and cannot be used as a reason for make-up exam fees. And the above two reasons cannot explain why a make-up exam fee is required for students who miss the exam due to illness. In short, make-up exam fees are extremely unreasonable.</p>
<p>Make-up exam fees are unreasonable, and the amount charged by each school is extremely excessive. My school's regulations stipulate: "The make-up exam fee is three yuan per course, and those with six or more courses are charged a flat rate of eighteen yuan." From one point of view, this regulation is too excessive; from another point of view, it is similar to "the more you buy, the cheaper it is" in stores, isn't it a joke? And it is a fact that teachers in the school deliberately deduct points because of the make-up exam fee in order to obtain more make-up exam fees.</p>
<p>Although make-up exam fees are so unreasonable, very few universities and middle schools in Shanghai do not stipulate make-up exam fees. Therefore, I hope that the school authorities will abolish this unreasonable regulation. If they do not abolish it, please reduce the amount or provide a regulation for students who did not take the exam due to illness to be exempted from paying, because living expenses have risen abnormally recently, and teachers who take education as their responsibility should not add to the burden of parents.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Activities Make a Home; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Pregnancy Has Skills</p>
<p>Zhu Ai'ren said: "Did that woman have children later?" Tang Huizhen said: "Listen to me! When the doctor examined her body, he thought she was at the point of remarrying her husband, hoping that after remarrying her husband, there would be hope of having children. Who knew that after she knew that she could have children, she went to ask a doctor who was good at artificial insemination to teach him to perform artificial insemination. But she was a widow, and her husband had been dead for three years. Where could she get the sperm from? She said: Please choose a strong man and solicit sperm. I can give him a great reward. But you must not tell him who is going to perform this artificial insemination, and you don't have to tell me what the man's name is. Although I borrowed the seeds from him, I still do it secretly, so as not to cause too much fuss later. The doctor followed the plan and solicited sperm from men. Some refused to waste sperm, and some agreed as expected, and followed her secret conditions. The doctor isolated the man and woman in the hospital and did not allow them to meet, and then performed the operation. The operation was performed three times, and later the widow was actually pregnant. Her abdomen gradually expanded, just like other pregnant women. When the pregnancy was full term, she successfully gave birth in their hospital. But she gave birth to a girl. The widow was a little dissatisfied. She complained to the doctor: What I want is a boy, not a girl. Didn't I tell you this earlier? The doctor smiled bitterly and said: Madam! I have done my best for you. But my research on artificial insemination is a great invention. As for the 'method of choosing men and women,' although there is that kind of theory, it has not yet been invented! Unless you come again, but I can only guarantee the child, but I can't guarantee the son!" Tang Huizhen said, laughing non-stop. Zhu Ai'ren said: "Did she ever repeat the operation to achieve the goal of having a son?" Tang Huizhen said: "I don't know about that! That kind of stubborn woman may have achieved the goal. But the man who borrowed the seeds for the second operation was definitely not the man who borrowed the seeds for the first operation. We don't need to talk about this. In short, whether it is a man or a woman, there is only a mother and no father. This child is certainly not her ex-husband's child, but she has no second husband. Who are the parents of this child? The so-called legal lineal ascendants are only half. But she is a widow and can be free, and no one can interfere with her. It is only human nature for her to want a son because she is childless. As for the child being born, it is not impossible to only have the mother's surname without knowing the father's surname. It's just that I think once this trend starts, it will be carried forward and expanded, and the word 'father' in the dictionary can be eliminated." (226)</p>
<h3>Letter from the Women's Education Center</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Essays: I have just read your article "Applying for the Women's Education Center" in your column. Regarding the recruitment of clerks in our center, although there is no intention to slander, there are some discrepancies with the facts. I respectfully submit the following to you:</p>
<p>(1) Our center, in view of the importance of the status of administrative staff in an organization, specially carefully selects true talents. This is based on actual needs, in order to eliminate the common malpractice of introducing relatives and friends.</p>
<p>(2) The regulations stipulate a monthly salary of thirty yuan, providing room and board, and a five-month probation period. Those with excellent results will continue to be hired and issued appointment letters. The original text says that there is no food to eat and no salary to be received until five months later, which is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(3) Considering the neglect of abacus and calligraphy in ordinary schools today, our center expected no more than forty or fifty applicants. As a result, there were 114 applicants, divided into two classrooms. The preliminary examination admitted 30 candidates, and the re-examination admitted Deng Jiadi, Shan Defen, Bei Jilan, Li Yunan, and Xu Ru, a total of five candidates. The original text said that there were 150 applicants and that they were divided into three classrooms, which is another misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(4) The abacus exam questions were extremely simple, and the amount had been tried by colleagues in our center in advance, and could be completed in 50 minutes. Abacus is a necessary skill for clerks, and speed is especially important. Due to practical difficulties, the time for collecting the papers was delayed by ten minutes, but there were many good papers. What the original text said is probably because the author is not familiar with this technology.</p>
<p>(5) The general knowledge exam, due to the actual needs, paid special attention to the actual life of modern society, so it cannot be limited to the rigid atomic and molecular formulas and principles. If you prepare with the attitude of generally applying to ordinary schools, you will feel disappointed and fall short.</p>
<p>The above items have not been fully explained. I am enclosing a copy of the brochure and the full set of exam papers for your reference, so as to clarify the truth. With special respect, I wish you well.</p>

<h3>Errol Flynn's History of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Ten Years of Hard Work Before Reputation Was Established: Wife is One-Handed But Very Affectionate</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Errol Flynn, a martial arts actor affiliated with Warner Brothers, is currently the most popular martial arts actor. He is only twenty-six years old this year, but he already has such a reputation.</p>
<p>Humble Origins</p>
<p>He was the youngest son of a miner in South America. In the second month of his birth, his father, Brinkett, passed away from him, but fortunately, his mother was able to barely maintain the family's livelihood by relying on the hard work of her ten fingers. Therefore, before Errol Flynn graduated from middle school, he had already begun to struggle with life. In 1930, Paramount Company recruited a large number of film talents, so he joined Paramount Company in that year. Because he was only seventeen years old at that time, he only did some simple editing work, but he was already very satisfied, because he was confident that it was at least slightly better than the mining life his deceased father had done. After two years, he began to be transferred to work in the screenwriting department. In that year, he spent a lot of effort and actually compiled a script called "Magic Kingdom Spring Dynasty". Later, after the company authorities reviewed it, they also thought it was very satisfactory, so he was soon promoted to consultant of the screenwriting department. In the winter of that year, he guest-starred in two films, "Mu Hreni" and others. As a result, the excellence of his acting skills was beyond general expectations. So the company decided to give him the position of senior actor concurrently. Later, he co-starred with the recently deceased Van Dyke in a martial arts film, "The Bloodbath of the Fuxiang".</p>
<p>Back on the Screen</p>
<p>In the early winter of 1934, he had a small rift with the company and officially separated from Paramount that year. After that, he established a film factory outside Le Cesse, but as a result, he lost a large sum of money in a short period of six months. Therefore, in addition to losing all the money he had accumulated over the years, he also owed more than five thousand gold in debt, so he had to announce the closure of the factory. At that time, Sherman Warner, the owner of Warner Brothers Films, learned that Errol intended to return to the film industry, so he personally asked Errol to join Warner. Errol was forced by the situation, so he resolutely agreed. As a result, he signed a contract for one year and six months, but the weekly salary was set at only 140 US dollars.</p>
<p>Acting Maturity</p>
<p>After joining Warner, before "The Rose War Tide", which he co-starred with Edward Robinson, was completed, he had already fallen in love with Una Xueke, a female employee of the company, and announced their marriage. This bride only had one left hand, but Errol's feelings for her were very affectionate. After that, he successively starred in more than ten martial arts films such as "The Biography of Peter the Great", "Ebao Feng", "New Robin Hood", "The Biography of Heroes", and "Robin Hood". As a result, due to the gradual progress of his acting skills, his reputation soared after the release of "The Biography of Peter the Great". It was not until the release of "The Biography of Heroes" in 1936 that Errol Flynn was recognized by world movie fans as the leader in martial arts films. Lin Shusen, a famous actor who is famous in the opera world for his role as a red actor, was hired by the Xinji Grand Stage this time and is scheduled to officially appear on the stage on the first day of the summer calendar. The contract is for a period of one year. The photo is of "Sweeping the Pine".</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Handsome Man Li Xiangyun and Zang Languang</p>
<p>There are two people in the Beiping opera circle who are very beautiful in their plays. One is the Muslim Li Xiangyun, and the other is Zang Languang, a high-achieving student of Wang Huifang. Both are 24 or 5 years old, and their body shapes and appearances are suitable for singing the flower shirt, and their voices are all pleasant to hear. A few years ago, Li was known as the most handsome man in the north. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I arrived in Ping. One day, my friends Yuan Datong (a famous Ping opera artist in the old capital) and Wang Zishen took a beautiful young man to my residence. Seeing that he was dressed in fashionable clothes and had a heavy air of rouge, I still suspected that he was a rising star in the industry. After Yuan introduced him, I learned that this was the long-famous handsome man Li Xiangyun. A month later, he performed "Farewell My Concubine" at Jixiang Garden in Dong'an Market. I specially asked Yuan to invite me to watch it. When we arrived, we saw an old man with white hair in the next box, who had arrived before us. Seeing that he was over eighty years old, he was still in good spirits. When Li's "Farewell My Concubine" appeared, the old man was in high spirits, sometimes applauding, sometimes talking and laughing. During the sword dance, applause rang out from the audience. (In fact, the swordsmanship was not very good) The old man nodded and smiled, even more proud. At the end of the play, the crowd dispersed, but he was still sitting still. After a while, I saw Xiangyun hastily finish undressing, his face still covered with rouge, and he put on a coat and rushed to the old man, helped him downstairs, and went into the car together. Later, I asked Yuan Datong, and I learned that this old man was Mr. Jiang Han. Jiang was the director of the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Institute and a famous gentleman in Ping City. Xiangyun was his adopted son, and Jiang loved him more than his own son. All the expenses for Xiangyun to hire teachers to learn opera, purchase equipment, and so on were all funded by Jiang. That is, Jiang also regularly reserved two or three boxes and several rows in the main hall for each of Li's performances. Therefore, over the years, the amount of support this old man has given Xiangyun should not be small. (171)</p>
<h3>The Tragic Assassination of Ren Daidai</h3>
<p>— Bingbing</p>
<p>Her father was Cantonese, her mother was Filipino; her wandering life was unbearably bleak.</p>
<p>The assassination of the famous dancer Ren Daidai caused a sensation, especially among the dance community. The details of her murder were gruesome: her throat was first strangled, and then she was stabbed multiple times in her lower body, leading to her death. It was truly a tragic sight. For a young woman who sold her beauty to meet such a violent end is truly unfortunate and pitiful.</p>
<p>Ren Daidai was originally from Guangdong. She had been a renowned star dancer in Hong Kong. After coming to Shanghai, she joined the Huierdeng Ballroom in the western part of the city, where she had been working for a year. Daidai was only twenty years old, and her life was extremely desolate. Her father was Cantonese, and her mother was Filipino. Her mother disappeared during Daidai's childhood, making her a mixed-race child of "international love." Her father had also passed away some time ago.</p>
<p>In the recent past, a certain "military personnel" pursued her ardently, but she remained aloof, seemingly unimpressed. However, this is a common occurrence in the pleasure grounds where gold buys smiles. Whether his love turned to hatred and motivated the murder, or whether there were other complex reasons, it is impossible to speculate from the outside. It remains a mystery.</p>
<p>The tragedy occurred in apartment number eleven of building one hundred and nine in Jing'an Villa. Initially, the ballroom noticed her absence for three consecutive days and received no response when they called. Everyone said Ren Daidai was missing. Little did they know that she had already bled to death and returned to the realm of sorrowful ghosts. When the apartment servant entered the room for routine cleaning and discovered the horrific scene, her blood had already dried up, no longer possessing the red and vibrant color of peach blossoms!</p>
<h3>The Swallows' New Song</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Early singing stars such as Luo Diwanli and Al Jolson are gradually losing audience attention. Even the "King of Bass" Bing Crosby has met the same fate, though he continues to make films. His previous work, "Paris Honeymoon," clearly emphasized comedy. As for "The Swallows' New Song," we cannot deny that it relies on the appeal of Linda Ware. Linda Ware can sing and act, and the abundance of talent in Hollywood is probably the reason why early singers are gradually retiring.</p>
<p>As for the performance of "The Swallows' New Song," the director's weak handling is undeniable. He merely followed the script to present the story, failing to effectively control several important scenes. For example, the hardship of Lai Lei's training of children, the sudden ban by the New York Child Protection Society on the eve of the performance, and the mental turmoil of Lai Lei when Qi Si succeeded were all lightly dismissed. Even several performances failed to use lively camera angles to enhance the musical atmosphere of the time. It is even more regrettable that the Tan Luo Xu Orchestra was not adequately introduced to the audience, only shown in a "distant view."</p>
<p>Bing Crosby and the female lead, Lois Comber, are merely accessories in this play, without anything remarkable.</p>
