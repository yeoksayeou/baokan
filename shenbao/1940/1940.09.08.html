<h3>日軍如在越南登陸　華軍必作有效抵抗　越南邊境重要鐵路橋梁均已破壞　傳日軍一營由諒山入越旋即退去</h3>
<p>重慶　華方對於越南允日軍假道消意之對策、目下雖尙難獲知詳情、但一般人鑒於八月一十八日外交部所發之宣言、皆信日軍如一旦在越南登陸、集中邊境之華軍卽將在越南北部之叢山中佔　軍事要點、以抵抗日軍由河內沿鐵路北攻昆明之企圖、據軍事專家之意見、認為叢山中之重要鐵路橋樑均已破壞、華軍可在沿邊境一帶、作有效之抵抗、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>河內　法政府公報頃稱、日軍昨晨已進入越南邊境之同堂（譯音）、但於昨日下午六時卽退、未起戰鬥、日代表團領袖西原少將、今晨往訪越督特古斯對此事件、表示深切遺憾、（七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>河內　昨日午前有日軍約一營、由軍官一員率領、未獲上峯命令、擅自在諒山軍區同唐地方（譯音）附近、越過邊界、進入越南境內、幸賴法國軍官態度堅決、並持以鎭靜、事態得未擴大、並迅卽解決、待至午後、日軍部隊卽全數退出越南邊界、日本考察團首席代表西原將軍、旋於本日午前向越南總督特古中將表示深切歉意、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>重慶　今日權威消息、中國國民政府已決定決一俟日人侵犯越南任何部分、立卽派遣軍隊進入越南、然當越南領土主權尙未爲日人侵犯時、中國軍隊仍將尊重越南領土主權、蓋中國軍隊、將待日人實施侵略時、始採取此項行動、又據大公報載、準備於日人侵犯法國領土時進入越南之華軍、已有二十萬人、又據中央社訊爲保證越南之適應交通、昆明與河口間之無綫電播音、昨已開設、消息靈通方面謂、關於日方之要求、雖渠等獲悉報吿、證實法當局已採妥協態度、然東京與維希兩方面之討論、均未進入最後階段、關於日軍假道越南一節、所討論之內容、一爲日軍或曰海軍陸戰隊應准經由此路者之人數問題、二爲日本所應取之路綫問題、三爲允許日人登陸之地點問題、聞日人可經山之路、係限於自海防至老開一段鐵路、及河內諒山間支路、又聞日人得在越南登陸之地點、　有三處、（七日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　重慶方面雖有越南當道已許日兵一萬二千人在三處登陸之說、但路透社外交訪員稱截至目前、倫敦迄未接日軍在越南登陸之消息、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>河內　據聞中國軍隊曾於本月五日進入越南境內、與法國邊防部隊一度發生激烈衝突、卒被擊退、法方死一人、傷十人、事後邊界防務業經充實、（七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>馬尼刺　此間中外人士聞越南當局依允日本要求假道進兵、大爲震動、初以爲越當局堅强立塲、如始終不變、則日本終將撤回其要求而不願此時發難於越南、且英美相繼向日交涉保持遠東現狀、越當局之手腕當可因以加强、今乃倏然變計度必德國壓迫維希政府强令讓步所致（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>維希　關於越南問題、越南當局與日本代表仍在河內城賡續舉行會議、同時法日兩國政府、亦在懇摯環境中、進行談判、美國國務卿赫爾曾經發出聲明、以維持越南現狀爲言、據東京方面消息、法日談判無論在已往或在目下、均未牽涉越南現狀、此層已在此間獲有證實、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>香港　據越南負責方面消息、法日已商妥基本協定、准許日軍僅可紗過東京境、日方申請得用飛機塲之便利、業經法當局予以拒絕、日軍僅准在海防登陸、而乘火車經法境前進、惟不得離鐵路區域、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　權威中立消息頃稱、日本與越南已成立協定允許日本通過軍隊、利用空軍根據地、並在滇越路駐紮軍隊、抵此之私人方面消息、雖謂越南已拒絕日本要求空軍根慷地、然指陳日人於前月中、不論在軍事或商業方面、已自由使用河內機塲、關於假道運兵條件之詳情、尙未獲知、因關於日方種種要求之談判、尙在河內進行、然消息難通方面、謂法國已允日本在越南之某種特定區域內及沿鐵路一帶運兵、（七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>香港　權威消息稱、頃據英國官方云、越南允許日本運兵之協定雖已成立、然日本軍隊尙未在越南登陸、而數日內、尙不　登陸、現河內之談判仍在進行、法國之協定、僅允日軍假道東京區域、然此項運兵之詳細辦法、尙在河內商討、並稱法人於允許日軍假道中、約定日軍只能利用滇越路達華境、而不能離開鐵路地帶、聞日本要求在越南建築正式空軍根據地一節、已經法方拒絕、惟權威方面力言、關於此點及他種問題、仍在繼續談判、據自河內抵此之旅客稱、渠等尙未窺見任何日軍登陸之形跡、雖在河內之飛機塲、見有穿軍衣之日人二十人、然此亦非異常之事、又越南之中國權威方面、相信日軍登陸時、必令其軍隊中若干人喬裝華軍而於桂越邊境發動紛擾、由是乃可主張在越南駐軍以消減所謂「中國之恐怖主義」云、（七日合衆電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局感言</h3>
<p>說人類是政治動物，這是人類逐漸進化的成就；說人類是好戰的動物，這是原始所遺留的根性；今日的世界，便是人類根性的暴露，遂相殘殺。</p>
<p>單以歐洲來講，從去秋戰幕揭開時起，交戰雙方的作戰方式已自最初局部屠殺的潛艇水雷戰，經過傘兵坦克戰，而演進到目下集體屠殺的「倫敦夜襲」和「柏林轟炸」。照這樣推演下去，如果勝負不能早決，保不定也許還要採用談虎色變的瓦斯戰或微菌戰！在這樣學術昌明，人智發達的現時代中，而有如此殘忍的現象，眞不免令人發生文化倒退數千年的感想！</p>
<p>若論這次歐戰的戰果，吾們姑且置首先開戰各國，即英法德波四國的得失於不談；而赤裸裸擺在吾們眼前的事實，至少已是許多小國的滅亡或肢解。可憐這些小國本身雖有弱點，其立國根本，却是和平的，中立的，人不犯他們，他們也決不犯人；這一次却在戰爭範圍的擴大聲中，爲了若干大國軍略的或政治的理由，而相繼作了聯帶的犧牲者：屈指數來，在過去一年中，如此被大國佔據或併吞的，已不下七八國之多；而最近遭遇這樣一個類似厄運的，却是東南歐方面一個面積二十九萬餘方公里，人口兩千萬的所謂「中立國」——羅馬尼亞。這是巴爾幹方面在此次歐戰中第一個犧牲者，他的領土並不是被交戰國用武力奪去，而是被其他三個中立國瓜分了三分之二，質言之：蘇聯憑藉自己的威力，索去了貝薩拉比亞和蒲哥維那，保加利亞在英蘇兩國贊助之下，討了杜多魯伽，最後匈牙利國却因義德兩國的聲援，而得了外錫爾伐尼亞。這一個瓜分運動，名義上都是索還舊地，實際上無非是趁火打刧。當然，羅馬尼亞以其種族之複雜，黨派的傾軋，平時旣不知消弭內部矛盾，充實武備：歐戰以還，又依違於兩大之間，始終沒有獨立自主的應付方針：其招致鄰人覬覦，原是意料中事，吾們現在也不遑去批評其是非。吾們所亟欲研究並且認爲十分重要的，却是這一個國家被瓜分之後、這一方面是否便可就此太平無事？關於此點，正恐是相反，即巴爾幹方面不免於從此多事了。</p>
<p>本來，在去年戰事發作之後，許多人認爲首先因波及而爆炸的，必是巴爾幹半島方面的火藥庫；誰知事竟不然，反而北歐在先，西歐次之，菲洲又次之，而錯綜複雜的東南歐洲竟出乎意外的尙未受着刀兵之苦。可是今後呢，羅馬尼亞國王是遜位了，、政權是落在鐵衛團手中了，從此他的外交政策是摒棄英國而傾向軸心國了；這一切難道便能消滅東南歐洲方面列强勢力的矛盾嗎？從旁冷眼觀察，毋寗要得一個相反的結論：即英德之戰，如果延長下去，那麽不問從軍略和政治觀點來看，或簡單地本着物理來說，戰事範圍將來必然地要繼續擴展下去。縱觀歐洲全圖，此後恐怕也祗有這東南歐一隅，是戰禍的可能發展區了。</p>
<p>在這裏，吾們不禁要爲現階段的英德兩國作戰意義，檢討一下：（一）以英國言，在去秋德波戰事發生之初，英國的參戰是含着「抱不平，興義師」之意味的，不過就目前來講，英國當初既反對德國向波蘭索還但澤和走廊，現在怎麼反來贊成保加利亞向羅馬尼亞索回舊地，而且旣以反侵略爲言，蘇聯侵略芬蘭波蘭，日本侵略中國，英國爲什麼不向蘇日宣戰呢？（二）以德國言，在去年開戰前後，德國一方面是標榜民族原則，一方面則以自衛和抵抗民治國的威脅爲言、可是到了此際，民族原則早已不知去向，而所謂威脅，以今日德國之兵力，和歐洲大陸的現狀，德國已是安如泰山，人家怕他還來不及，誰還敢來犯他呢！所以說，一年來英德兩國的作戰意義，俱已有了極大的變遷：澈底講，今日英德之戰，充分顯示其爲彼此互爭歐洲覇權之戰！依吾們所見，歐洲雖小，豈眞容不得二三個大國並存，何况一方是島國海軍國，一方是大陸國陸軍國，彼此儘有相讓相輔，共存共榮之餘地。這在希特勒「我的奮鬥」一書中，本來就沒有把英國列爲敵國，他似乎還曾責備威廉二世不應在上次歐戰中和英國作戰。</p>
<p>當然，在英德戰事難解難分的今日提出這種勸吿，這等於是夢想，不過吾們所以忍不住仍要提出者，正因爲吾們從此時此地的立塲來看，深覺現在的歐戰，無論如何，在意識上，遠不若遠東戰事的明期；換句話說，遠東之戰是不得不戰，至於英德之戰，則本可不戰。歐戰結果，除了兩敗俱傷不算外，平空還妥白白犧牲許多小國；又况根據歷史的經騐，每次大戰之後，往往在議和的時候便預先伏下了下次大戰的禍根；拿破崙失敗後維也納會議的往事，和上次歐戰後巴黎和會的造孽，便是前車之鑒。英德都是優秀的民族，爲什麼不見及時覺悟的徵候，難道眞是人類好戰的根性，支配了他們的理智嗎？</p>
<h3>遏制遠東侵略　美蘇正進行談話　英美合作應付日威脅　保護在遠東重要權益</h3>
<p>紐約　紐約郵報華盛頓訪員稱、爲遏止日本在遠東侵略潮流起見、美國已發動對蘇之重要討論、聞諸國務院可恃方面、此項談話之第一目的、在制止日本對荷屬東印度之攻擊、美·蘇討論或有造成美·蘇正式或非正式聯盟之可能、惟在目前美國方鄭重將事、未提出具體建議、不過以美蘇現舉行談話之事實爲日本當頭捧喝耳、國務院幫辦威爾斯與蘇駐美大使烏曼斯基之屢次晤談、即討論此事也、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　消息靈通方面稱、美政府頃似已採用廣泛之行動、以對抗日本之擴張勢力於遠東、又聞蘇聯駐美大使烏曼斯基、曾與美國務副卿威爾斯作迭次之談判，並將於威爾斯假滿返都後繼續進行、消息靈通方面以爲、美國正在助英勸請蘇聯與德國解除不侵略同盟之關係、（七日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨日聲稱、渠除於上星期三發表關於越南之聲明外、美國將向日本提出關於維持越南蟹荷屬東印度現狀之抗議、赫爾氏避免涉及抗譏之直接答話、然渠謂、倘「若干和平政府」亦同出此舉、則渠將不感覺驚異、渠稱、渠相信法國對於足以干擾越南現狀之「若干建議」、尙本表示同意、（七日台衆電）</p>
<p>東京　據時常發表軍部意見之國民新聞載稱、英美對日態度、逐步趨於强硬、此以英、美共同致牒日政府可以爲證、蓋英、美政府切欲維持越南之現狀、對於其變動大爲關切也、該報預料、英美共同在遠東進行之「錯誤的干涉政策」、得使西南太平洋局勢日趨緊張、繼謂日本對於英、美在太平洋區加緊共同陣綫、不能忽然置之、故必須注視大局之發展、而準備應付任何事變云、朝日新聞謂、日本必須以決心準備克服英、美合作置於創立大東亞共同繁榮圈途中之一切阻力、蓋此圈爲日本國家生存所必要也前美國駐華艦隊總司令雅納爾海軍少將等近曾發言、主張英、海軍會同擊倒日、德、而九月四日美國務卿赫爾對越南事務所發之言論、翌日英外相哈立法克斯亦在下院發表同樣言論、此足證英、美對遠東事務之合作、英美旣在大西洋合作後、美國自將積極發展其遠東政策、而英國允不鑿沉其艦隊、亦可使美國不必關心大西洋事務、（七日路透社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（三）　開戰前夕　英國民間生活</h3>
<p>運河中有所謂「水橋」者，卽運河在公路下通過之處。「水橋」築於一百五十年前，誠工程上之奇蹟。我等在大運河中，經過磚石「水橋一多座，係拿破崙敗於滑鐵盧時所造。餘者已改以水泥鋼骨，作半圓形，橫跨於新闢公路之上。艇過時，聞橋下有長途汽車軋軋駛過，頗有異樣之感。</p>
<p>時當七月，英倫破曉頗早。淸晨三時許，幽林中已有鳥嗚啾啾，各鳥漸相應和，終至百烏齊唱，婉轉抑揚，殊悅耳也。</p>
<p>一日，早餐已畢，見有駁船一艘，載木材極高，駛入古橋下，進退不得。英倫運河橋樑，多作穹形，以磚造成，雖年代已久，靑苔叢生，但仍堅牢異常，罕有須加修葺者。威頓附近一橋，造於一八〇〇年，原用以通行牲口。今倫敦與柏明罕間之公路，亦通過該橋，車運頻繁，重十五噸之卡車亦往來不絕，其堅固可知矣。</p>
<p>出倫敦區，水閘多無人看管，故各船皆携搖手，將抵水閘，例有一孩前奔，以搖手啟水閘，任船通過。余見一女孩，以搖手啟閘，殊不費事。待余首次啟閘，則錯誤百出，屢費心機，閘始得啟。久之乃熟悉門徑，運用搖手，靈活如船童矣。</p>
<p>運河船夫，世代相傳。當大運河公司成立，起用運河時，添置駁船四百艘，惟船夫奇缺，卒招用航海水手，駕駛新船駁。徒因用非所習，行於極挾之運河，閘船互撞，屢見不鮮，歷久始順利。</p>
<p>英倫鄕野，高崗起伏，不若荷蘭與德國北部一片平原之宜於運河交通。我等漸行漸高，經四十五處水閘後，航於高約四百呎之屈林高地，大巡河蜿延流過高地者凡三處。</p>
<p>運河兩岸時見一竿垂釣者，莫不鄭重其事，靜坐河濱，凝視釣索入水處，歷數小時不移。彼等或僅係離家坐河畔曝日而已，蓋罕見其有魚上釣也。我等所駕小艇，爲英人所罕見，但垂釣者不加一顧。英人之專一心志，是其成功秘訣。</p>
<p>再前進，河身漸高，河水亦漸淸澈。嗣抵列克曼士華斯，游華克船廠。廠主華克君導我等觀運河船舶建造工程。造船係用柚木，性質堅硬，來源日稀，蓋英國造船業發達，已供不應求。運河船舶建造及修理時，均出之精工。華克君曰，造船須求其堅牢，否則日後送廠修理，聲譽有關也。</p>
<p>鄉區船夫，今仍保持英國勞工傳統的勤懇精神。余在某村出鞋修理，鞋匠爲述修鞋手續，滔滔不絕，臚述之詳，直類託其重造戰艦。</p>
<p>翌日星期六，都市居民相率乘車來鄉區游散露營，經我等在道旁所設帳幕，駐足小談者，頗不乏人。倫敦火車與長途汽車辦理週杪鄕游業頗力。近者離市五六哩，遠者在五十哩以外，數日後始返。游客携有導游錄，無迷途之虞，且可隨意行過私人田畝及草塲，祇須弗離道踐踏，不致被逐。</p>
<p>我等在巴區胡斯所架帳幕，適在鐵道，公路與運河會合處。時屆星期日，汽車自由車不絕於途，平均每小時馳過車輛，達六百輛之多。某鐵道每隔五分鐘卽從倫敦載到游客一批，摩肩接踵，擾嚷不巳。兼以運河駁船載鋼鐵北駛柏明罕，引擎砰然，閘門啟合，諸聲雜作，澈夜不息。</p>
<p>巴區胡斯橋旁水閘看守人見船駛過，卽詳叩所載貨物，船長船主姓名，前往伺地，一一錄下。據告我等，平均日有駁船八十艘成對經過。其曾祖曾自一七九四年起，在該處看管水閘，三代傳襲，克盡厥職，從未受政府分文，今已第四代矣。</p>
<p>我等登岸繞閘閒游，見船兩對，同時駛來。乃叩水閘看守人，何船可先過水閘，答曰，先見者先過，然有時亦不能言定何船爲先。</p>
<p>此次兩船婦互爭先後，各不相讓，致兩船首同擠人閘口，無從駛過。水閘看守人亟向彼所認爲後至一船，搖手示意。相峙久之，一船夫不耐爭吵，高呼另一船船夫曰：「來，來，朋友，且登岸一飲啤酒，聽太太們解決可耳。」</p>
<p>運河修理工程某監督相識未久，邀我等離閘入其花園一遊，頓覺淸靜異常。其人愛談花卉，余不禁思及兩種英人之逈然不同：其一專心經營小花園，務使百花爭妍；其一則富冒險性，橫跨大陸，跋涉重洋，忍暑耐寒，以保先人所創立之大英帝國。</p>
<p>離巴區胡斯上行，經加西奧柏里公園，祇見草木靑翠欲滴。英國名勝保管局曾收買風景區頗多，以資保存，加西奧柏里公園其一也。英人之愛好大自然，性喜遊覽者，對於此種保存名勝，以利民衆遊樂之舉，擁護甚力，故該局收買森林，湖沼，山峯，古堡與村莊極多，視爲公產，永加保留。</p>
<p>晚出第六十五處水閘，而達屈林高地卡胡洛斯特，其地高出海面三百九十三呎，乃大運河最高處。該處旅舍，船夫畢集，或作投箭戲，或飲啤酒。水閘左近，類皆有公共塲所，以便船夫憇息。</p>
<p>我等在過卡胡洛斯特一哩處，帳幕露宿。突有不速之客闖來，逕問我等擬往何處，彼亦美國人，原擬偷乘舟車，橫貫英倫，未果，乃決定步行。</p>

<h3>不願變更防軍決議　美決將接防中區　赫德上將昨日績開會議　事畢後於下午乘艦返青</h3>
<p>美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德上將、於四日由靑島突然抵滬、在此簡短之時期中、曾與美國代理總領布德立及第叫聯隊司令貝克上校等、迭次舉行會議、檢討遠東一般局勢、並討論防區問題、有所決定、赫氏以在滬公畢、已於昨日下午二時乘美艦大理石號離滬赴靑島、擬本月下旬乘旗艦奧古斯泰號返滬、昨日上午十時許、當赫氏行前、貝克上校與美總領布德立氏、復作一度議、討論美軍準備接防乙區之種種問題、以日方旣已在丁區派兵巡邏、實際上控制該區、則美軍之接防乙區、實屬必要、故防區問題、在最短期內必有新發展、</p>
<p>美願遵守　防軍決議</p>
<p>昨日權威方面堅稱、赫氏在滬、巳對其屬下保證、對於防軍委員會所作關於防區問題之決議、如有變更、美國並不同意、以日軍所以尙未正式接收滬西「丁」區者、乃因美日兩方對於防區問題之談判、陷停頓狀態中也、故深信不久、美海軍第四聯隊或將接收中區之防務，該區現在駐防之萬國商團原爲牧時性質、但同時日方授意之消息則堅稱、美國防軍不致相任此項工作、</p>
<p>日軍業已　控制丁區</p>
<p>自公共租界及法租界聯合實施特別戒備以來、爲時已及一周、本有卽日解除之說、惟因前日愚園路暴徒擬襲擊工部局警務處副總巡姚克事件發生後、此種戒備措置、或有延長「九一八」後之可能、而兩租界戒備情形、亦頗緊張、日憲兵隨地執行檢查往來行人車輛、而尤以白利南路·（兆豐公園西）愚園路憶定盤路·愚園路地豐路·等三處檢纑更爲嚴密、每處均有日憲兵及僞驚四名駐守、日方並在大西路會樂宮睹窟內·及愚園路八三四號兩處、設有憲兵司令部、門前均由日憲兵四名駐守、並在該處沿途架設軍用電綫、工作相當忙碌、</p>
<h3>公共汽車勞資糾紛　迄未妥洽　工方所提條件　資方業已婉拒</h3>
<p>英商中國公共汽車公司全體工友約二千人、曾於本年七月六日、向資方提出改善待遇要求、內容計爲（一）資方不得無故開除工友、（二）資方須視生活指數之高低、盡量改善工友待遇、（三）每日工作時間不得超過八小時以上、吾則作爲「特別工」論、（按特別工每小時薪金以原來工作薪金加半倍計算、至特別工工作不滿一小時者、亦以一小時論、）又車務處工作僅以八小時爲限、不得再增、（四）星期日應停止工作、　假一天、工資照給、星期日工作者、以雙工論、（五）年終賞金、應由百分之五增至百分之十、以及其他各種要求共二十三項、</p>
<p>工人不滿　資文答覆</p>
<p>昨經平明社記者、訪悉、資方對於此項要求、業予逐條答覆、計最重要者有、（一）公司從米無故開除職工、但對工作不力行爲不檢者、得保留開除之權利、（二）公司已自動增加生活津貼米貼、且均以米價之漲落爲標準、待遇較諸上海其他各公司爲優、（三）關於八小時工作、原爲雙方所同意、惟車務處因情形複雜、難免超過、而機務處則從未超過八小時、卽不得已加工時、薪工亦按例照加、（四）至例假一節、公司本已有工作九天給與特假一天、及農歷年給假五天之規定、惟星期日乘車者車資旣不加倍、故星期日工作者自難以雙工計算、（五）每年普加工資、應根據公司之「執業信條」等項、勞方對此項答覆並不滿意、</p>
<p>執業信條　引志糾紛</p>
<p>昨據勞方聲稱、此次勞資糾紛、實起因於數月前公司當局迫全體工友簽署「執業信條所致、蓋該項信條、除塡寫詳細履歷外、尙須承認下列條規、（一）增薪之事聽憑公司裁奪、倘本人於健康上發生妨碍工作時、本人卽無條件自動辭職、（二）「公司章程得隨時修改、而本人當絕對服從」、等項、　方認爲如接受公司此項信條、則無異此後一切均須聽命資方、個人生活將益無保障、乃有上述改善待遇要求之提出云、</p>

<h3>寗波辦理　被炸善後</h3>
<p>寗波被炸善後各情、本埠浙省團體昨接電吿、（一）落　橋路新寳華門前、冷藏庫東側竹笆內、悅來巷合記桂圓號中間三處之炸彈、因均未爆發、現在新寳華門前之彈、經連日工作、已在地面下約五尺處泥土中發現、昨日可以取出、至冷藏庫東側及悅來巷之彈、據纑已失時效、不致爆炸、</p>

<h3>被綁之金本仁　業已脫險</h3>
<p>滬西康腦脫路康家橋附近、於五日清晨、有一人乘自由車輛、駛往該處、詎路旁竄出匪徒數名、攔住去路、出槍恫嚇、結果將期身畔法幣十餘元、掃數搜刦、并強奪其自由車一輛、揚長而去、事後該行遂卽報告附近租界崗捕</p>
<p>予以追捕</p>

<h3>維護在滬商業權益　美態度極堅決　英美華北貿易迭遭排斥　商業競爭現已集中滬市</h3>
<p>（大中社特稿）、自日本對華發動軍事侵略、歐美在華之貿易、因日本藉口軍事需要、多方干涉、日趨式微、在八一三以前、中國全國對外進口貿易、均以美國佔第一位、日德英次之、但自日本在華北實行貿易統制、第三國對華貿易劇減、淪陷區域市場、幾為日貨所獨佔、據海關統計、近年美日英對華全國貿易消長如下（單位金單位）</p>
<p>美貨　日貨　英貨</p>
<p>廿六年　八三、〇七五、一四一　六六、〇九八、一二三　四九、一二九、七四五</p>
<p>廿七年　六六〇、〇〇八、一七五　九〇、四八一、〇一一　三〇、八三六、九〇五</p>
<p>廿八年一至八六、二四九、九八一　一二六、五五五、七四四　三一、二四二、〇八四</p>
<p>廿九年七月九四、〇九三、〇〇〇　一〇五、五八二、〇〇〇　一六、六四〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（進口比較）最近日貨進口、較戰前陡增一倍、美貨雖亦稍有增加、純因美棉需要之關係、蓋中國本國棉花、被日人收購運日、國內反須以外匯購買美棉、且自去年起、又有歐戰之關係、故美國能維持對華貿易於不墜、而英德等國、則不堪回首矣、縱無歐戰之發生、觀乎民國二十七年之趨勢、亦必日就衰退也、華北方面、自發行、「聯銀劵、」實行輸入統制（進口商輸入外國貨初僅以出口商品所集結外匯百分之八十為限、）日貨進口佔絕對多數、英美貨物、瞠乎其後、</p>
<p>（滬關統計）但上海方面法幣照常流通、英美等國對華貿易、均集中上海、據海關統計、美日三國最近在滬產業競爭之趨勢如下、（單位金單位、）</p>
<p>美貨　日貨　英貨</p>
<p>廿六年　五一、一八七、四八九　三三、〇九六、三六二、一〇、二六六、一九五</p>
<p>廿七年　二六、五二三、二二二　一六、一五四、一五九　一二、九六二、〇九〇</p>

<p>廿九年七月六二、一三二、五六九　一六、三二、四二九　八、一五九、三五三</p>
<p>政治經濟二者、原為不可分離、列強對日政治讓步之結果、為在華權益之衰洛、設英美在滬再事退讓、則在華權利之崩潰、顯而易見、近今美國對上海之堅決態度、乃維護其在華權利之必然步驟也、</p>
<h3>滬輪駛海防西貢　船期不變更　航業界稱越局尚地變化</h3>

<p>（船期不動）據稱對今晨（卽昨晨）各報所載越南情況、尚未接到港越兩行報告、故不知究竟、但預定復航之太古江蘇輪、今日下午三時啟椗、經廈門　香港　海口·而至海防、貴陽輪亦定今日是午三時出口、經廈門·汕頭·香港·至暹羅、並兼灣灣西貢　雖運防客貨無多、決凖期開往、並無更動、</p>
<p>（越局未變）怡和洋行明生輪、定十一日復航海防、亦已開始出售客票、故對越局至昨日止、可擔保尚無變化、以復航滬越綫船隻並不改期一節、卽可證實、又太古公司近又調派前行駛南洋綫之安順輪、儎重三千一百八十八噸、來滬加入滬新綫行駛、該輪昨晨已抵滬、暫停浦東本行碼頭、定下星期二（十日）由滬首次開往新加坡、並兼　廈門·香港·及庇能等埠、</p>
<h3>江定輪仍未釋</h3>
<p>江定輪被扣、停泊高昌廟、迄無釋放消息、各情已誌昨報、外傳昨午獲釋、駛返十六舖五號碼頭一說、並無其呈、查該輪現泊南黃浦、迄昨下午、尚未掉頭、瑞泰德平兩輪、亦均拋泊該處一帶江面、均無動靜、又據大陸報云、日海軍發言人昨日（六日）午後否認報載德輪江定號被日當局扣禁之說、據稱、茲查悉江定輪並非被日方所扣、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙被激掀起巨浪</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、一致未更、英美　暗市、又起巨波、先猛緊後突稍回、初報載法國竟允許日軍假道越南侵華、人心恐懼、華商投機家復來傾出、且進口商又結美金三十萬元、傳日商銀行亦結四十萬元、但難證實、故某美行獨供二十萬元以上、其他各行亦扳價軋出、一時緊勢甚銳、美金五元二五尙係銀行吸進價、英金亦緊至三辨士四三七五、旋傳美蘇成立某項協定、扒風頓息、華銀行有供意、投機家來轉塞、美金頓回平至五元三四三七五、英金亦稍回硬、終聞某華行扒吸、午刻復軟、收市英金三辨士四五三一二五、美金五元二八一二五、英緊〇四六八七五、美緊〇六二五、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>進口商奮力收買</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英接二五、對滬大三分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辨士四八四三七五、美匯五元三一二五較之上日收市、英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇三一二五、開後市面尙穩、外行首先對做九月份美匯五元三四三七五、後洋行忽有大量結款、市面因此轉緊、初向美行進十月期美匯五元三一二五、約十二萬元、嗣入外行同月美匯已軟至五元二五、匯豐掛牌褐曉、悉無擊動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、此後投機商亦來扒進九月份美匯五元二一八七五、又十月份美匯竟吿五元一八七五、而斯時美行吃胃亦旺、計匯外行九月份美匯五元二五、嗣因有利空傳說、華商投機家前來吐出、潛勢漸形回鬆、計華商塞予外行十月份美匯五元二八一二五、又售與華銀行九月份美匯五元三一二五以至三四三七五、迨至午刻、外行售予華行本月份美匯均吿五元三一二五、收盤英金三辨士四五三一二五、美匯五元二八一二五、十月份美匯五元二五、英金三辨士四三七五、較之隔昨收市、英金期現各緊〇四六八七五、美匯微縮〇六二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港英平美動蘯</p>
<p>香港七日（週六）電　今晨匯市開盤吿平、美匯動盪不定、英匯現期貨均無榮辱、美匯現貨緊〇六二五、爲二十二元七五、申匯現貨升三元、爲四百三十元、（昨晚收爲四百二十七元）、日匯現貨長一元、爲九十六元半、九時四十分、美匯仍吿動盪、現貨回鬆〇六二五、爲二十二元八一二五、申匯現貨回降二元、爲四百二十八元、十時二十分吿鬆、申匯現貨回漲一元、爲四百二十九元、十一時三十分平定、各匯概無榮辱、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>金價大漲小回　半天百十元上落</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市、在外電於謠風中先漲後跌、各方人心迷亂、價六千二百元大關數次衝出後卽回入、初見醞釀已久之法國竟允許日軍假道越南侵華、外滙已在投機家與進口商及日行扒風中劇緊、人心惶惶、買氣瀰漫、賣戶更趁機居奇、晨開卽於混亂升至六千二百八十元高價、開後始見證券幫與金號傾售、買風始漸息、忽傳美蘇成立某種協定、外滙步回硬、價亦頓起反動而狂洛、新多頭四起斬結、立見狂退至六千一百七十元、後隨美金盤上、終爲六千一百九十五元、計回升三十元、下午週六交割例假、聞塲外價稍回低、半日交易共四千餘兩、飾金升起十元、爲六百四十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲卅元</p>
<p>晨初以滙市趨緊、人心堅挺非常、多數竟願照掛牌（卽開盤價）再高五元買入、當時成交不少、首由金號進銀號二十兩、爲六千二百八十元、比上日橫跳一百十五元、不意開後市勢突轉、因外滙斯時已報回鬆、頓引起賣風、某證券幫及金號曁散戶等爭先求售、十時許回低達六千一百七十元、後以滙市重軟、賣風漸息、銀號幫及錢兌業乘低力　、復漲至六千二百三十元、卒因人心多數看小逢高不時吐出銀號幫及證券幫等供塞殊力、收盤前重退至六千一百九十元、結果爲六千一百九十五元收盤、比上日尙軋漲三十元、收後依然帶疲照收盤價再低曾有成交、半天一百十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛高十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百三十元、迨九時半掛高十元、此後則無變動、計大同行改懸六百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣亦升</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、始因報載傳法已允日軍假道越南、致烚赤開盤大漲、英美金鎊需要亦殷、但不旋踵卽吿回落、終各漲起一元、英金票始曾高至十八元九角四分、嗣忽步　低落、卒爲十八元七角二分、比上日價漲五分、新加坡票回起一角、日金票跌風漸戢、晚市高至一元四角三分、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍爲一元一角六分、</p>
<h3>糧食　米成暗市　價無不昂　囤戶之敢於投機　銀錢業為之掌腰</h3>
<p>洋米市面、因米商懾於社會公論、及各方政擊、乃以塲外黑市之杜米賣買安全、足可效法、市塲中隨不復再見洋米正式交易矣、卽有成交、無非低次之貨、吾則卽爲冲貨替代、市上正式交易乃不足千包、洋米黑市暗盤、亦與粳米暗盤之層出不窮、一號西貢暹邏火絞均有六十四五元、二號及小絞均有六十一二元之說、而原包英華司二號暹邏與二號西貢因評價祇七十一元半、而暗盤早經超出、昨日復有七十三四五元之傳說、現貨與原包暗盤喊價均比前日較大一元之譜，蓋目下米市早被大戶壟斷與投機操縱、市上謠言百出、花樣翻新、無怪一般盲從之被惑也、故昨日正式實銷依然觀望、而浮囤散戶仍見活躍、成交數倂計連原包仍有六七千包、因有銀錢業爲之支持、可以抵押放款、故囤戶之膽愈大、市傳一號西貢復達六十五元、火絞六十四元、二號西貢六十二元半、二號暹遲及小絞六十一元、米茶五十一元、以前評價而論、又暗升二元之砠、僅東京次柏尖及紅米尙遵正軌、開出均爲五十六元、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、昨到略多、共有一千三四百包、傳聞明暗市人心因是較穩、况已價格轟至若是之昂貴、一般貨主亦知提升之不易、不再堅持、悉願依前盤開出、所以售價仍無榮辱、常帮淸粳七十七八元、常州蘇崑粳七十五六元、次至宿七十二三元、靑角薄稻七十二三元、南港原包早稻七十一二元、斛見六十九元半至六十八元半、金溧特元七十元、常丹白元六十八九元、香港糯特自七十元、中至六十四五元、至於新粳新羊尖到貨亦屬不弱、計抵埠者有周浦粳四十担、顓橋粳十六祖、及太倉羊尖二十二担、共計不下近百担致雖銷塲相隨洋米活潑異常、而行情難以見增、呈定局而已、售開周浦粳六十九元、顓橋粳六十九元半、太倉羊尖原包六十三四元、斛見六十元云云、</p>
<h3>粉市堅挺</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市一致堅挺、纑本廠粉自减少供給後、本街需要，早成供不敷求、且目下市上回籠貨亦感缺乏、致福新與老車牌、均無整額可購、廠盤雖仍爲十五元、而零沽市價、頗有參差、日廠粉鳳凰脾近有客帮取辦、更爲投機界之營業品、昨因米價又起在漲、新囤戶吸收復殷、價升五分至一角、計開現鳳凰十四元七角、九月份十四元九角半、十月份十五元三角半、成交四千五百包、又麵粉今日有一千包、運往夏門、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易依然淸閑、蓋由內地供給有限、輸入租界更多困難、華廠與出口帮進胃雖佳、迄無大額可收、且行家買賣交易形同走私貨、並無正式公開、昨聞崑太麥仍爲二十五元三五角、由出口辦去一二百包、至日廠進價仍祇二十一二元、收進約有二三千包、又麥子今日有九百八十包、運往厦門、</p>
<h3>紗花　存紗日增　明知囤紗非辦法　又從外匯發疾想</h3>
<p>紗市依然不離盤旋之境、港帮雖未大量採辦、然對於指定之紗、需要較爲起色、所以有一部份人心觀高而拖進、一般謹愼者、鑒於存紗逐步增高、如斯情形、日積月累、一味囤塌終非根本辦法、故大衆心理、仍傾向外匯上着想、因之執貨者、安靜如常、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市况平平、二十支雙馬價一千零十五元、卽漲至二十元、旋聞匯票縮後又復轉升、同時報載越境允日假道人心忽起虛風、下跌至一千零十二元、但天津帮突來收進二三百包、情况回昂至一千零十九元、不過康記銀行仍然賣出、收盤價爲一千零十八元半、查半日間成交統計二千六百二十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三元半、今日有棉紗七十五件運厦門、一千四百十五件運香港四十五件運海口、二百六十五件運暹遲、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、七三〇　香港八七五</p>
<p>厦門　五　福州　九　統計二、六二〇</p>
<h3>長纖維棉　被搜殆盡</h3>
<p>現棉交易尙佳、但比上日爲稀、廠方僅申新略有採辦外、其他依然靜默而勿動也、</p>
<p>巴西棉　二六〇·〇〇　申新進三五一件</p>
<p>大中集　二〇二·〇〇　申新進八五件</p>
<p>大中集　三二·〇〇　申新進九七件</p>
<p>米特林　二六三·〇〇　元誠進一〇〇件</p>
<p>巴西　二五八·四〇　元誠進一六七件</p>
<p>平果爾　一三九·五〇　盛和進一〇〇件</p>
<p>平果爾　一四〇·〇〇　永大進一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日稍形轉疲、大衆賣出及一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落五六磅音、印度昨日停市、預測又漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見活躍、尤以長纖維者爲最、蓋因市上此種原棉最缺、且海外裝運不便、兵險率奇高、洋行方面需先付款、然後裝運、殊不便利也、廠方需要較殷、故連日在市搜購頗烈、市上之長繼維者幾將搜盡、因此日來棉價漲風殊熾也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　客囤心思甚濃　市盤暫得穩定</h3>
<p>國布　昨市勢平和、售盤亦鮮變更、每疋祇一二角參差、實以滬市外銷阻隔、供過於求而內地因來源不繼、各貨奇俏、故客幫申莊在滬購貨心思甚濃、絡續囤積數量甚巨、市盤得獲穩定、昨本街成交五百餘件、粵港幫辦色布色斜等二百餘件、北路烟津幫辦粗布絨布等貨一百餘件、南洋幫辦色布色斜漂布等八千餘疋、本街門市店近來秋季廉價營業狀况較去年略形遜色、最大諸號營業數額每家日約四萬元、</p>
<p>東布　交易不多、而市氣則甚堅挺、白貨龍頭細布盤旋於三十二元九角左右、較前日市價每疋提升二角半、四君子嗶嘰因行方現售開價廉宜、仍喊九角三分二厘半、但人心看漲者居多、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭今日有一千一百五十五件，運往香港、又二百六十五件運厦門、又二件運海口、又二百十五件、運暹羅、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆交易開展　油豆進出甚旺</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、仍居好面，但其潛勢、未見狂暴漲風、出於踢皮球主顧絕跡實際銷塲、接而不湧、故波瀾範圍不廣、致大局不離徘徊之格、自連朝挺升以來、交易亦已開展昨日賡續熱鬧、市價尤見昂砌、計由南洋港帮本街等辦去靑島豆千餘包、價自三十四元半步提至三十七元五角、桑園豆五百餘包價爲三十四元三角至八角半、安慶豆二百餘包、價爲三十四元、蕪湖豆三百句、價爲三十二四元、南京豆二百包、價為三十三元、太倉新黃豆九十七包、價爲三十六元、浦東杜豆百譜包、崇明杜豆一百包、崇明沙黃一百五十包、大連夾靑豆二百包、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有一千一百九十五包、並豆餅一千張、生油九百七十五聽運往厦門、又有生仁五百二十包、生油一千五百七十聽、及豆子三百七十包、豆餅一千二百四十張、運往香港、又芝蔴六百八十五包、運往暹邏、</p>
<p>又生油昨由靑島來三千零七十聽、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖平疲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平疲、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧新貨七十八元二角、五月份到貨七十七元半、四月份到貨七十六元八角、轉口貨六十二元半、荷赤現貨六十三元八角、路貨六十三元、太古車白Ｂ嘜仍七十七元、下檔梢跌、DY嘜七十三元、HX嘜七十二元七角至五角、國糖僅有叫價、未成交、又糖昨由香港來一千一百六十包、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘盤元同昂</h3>
<p>昨日本廠元釘與盤元市價、均見吿漲、纑其原因、現分述二則如后、</p>
<p>本釘　本廠元釘、自五月二日外匯發牛劇變後、喊價飛漲至八十五元高峯、同業心思之高昂、當可見一斑、乃紛向海外購定製釘之原料（盤元）、入後因北幫納胃閉塞、內銷受封鎖阻隔、兼之南洋局勢時現惡劣、於是外埠交易一無足述、而本街建築幫銷塲又微、致本釘市面一蹶不振、且海外之定貨時到、一時供過於求、行情暴落不已、最低會入四十元關、虧損者頗不乏人、惟最近以來、烟台幫起而獲辦、而本市建築幫亦漸形活動、故行市重振、昨喊每桶五十元、已較前漲四五元不等、</p>
<p>盤元　製造本釘之原料、又名元絲、其市勢之升降、泰半隨本釘而高低、前昨本釘市價挺昂、　　貨問津者亦夥、標準亦繼長增高、每擔沽價亦在五十元光景、採辦亦殊不乏、大多係本街製釘廠所搜、</p>
<h3>海味　淡菜貨缺頻漲</h3>
<p>淡菜近以來源時斷、頗有供不應求之勢、市價於是遞升、刻下中隻西淡自一百七十元、遞升至一百九十元、其他國產品、如寗子淡已售三百十元、勢殊俏利、</p>
<h3>證券　內債之堅堅不可當　連漲十一日…高起四元餘</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況、竟又種籟上漲、大多數預測丙種五十五元、昨市祇差一角、惜未能穿出耳、按債市漲風、自八月二十六日起至昨日止、運漲十一日、中間雖有一二次小回旋、但其當日收盤價、必仍高過隔日之價、漲風延長若許之久、實始料所不及、銀根雖鬆、需要匯劃者幷未見增加、此可於貼水市價日見其低覘之、新借款之說、宣傳已久、非特未成事實、而各方一再吾認、尤使人忐忑不安、越南允許假道、侵滇勢已不免、觀　票之緊易鬆難、足以反證時局仍甚混亂、昨日市價丙種初已　進四元關、多方惟恐其下瀉、不得小再行掙扎、故下午一方奮勇拉抬、一方已在覓途逃避、但非局外人所可窺見其手段耳、總之市價上漲、已達四元以上、空頭抵補、至昨爲最甚、乃使檯面浮多、至爲擁擠、回風之來、勞已不免、如同康·久豐·鴻大·買進、已經多日、昨已感覺滿足、怡泰代某信託公司買進爲數已極可觀、空方不堪壓迫、乃亦大爲抵補、聯益·恒孚·乃乘高出籠、散戶方面大都補進爲多、多方壁晏愈築愈高、月盈則仄、此不易之理也、昨日結果、繼續再漲三角至七角之多、一律再見新高價、成交總數共計約一百六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交漢治萍公　股二百股、價為三元五角、</p>
<p>倫敦六日（週五）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍祗銀行股續見起色、計麥加利銀行續漲一先令二便士、價爲六鎊八先令九便士、其除均無變動、</p>

<h3>今天的祈禱日</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯神曁英國君王喬治六世，都定今天九月八日爲全國祈禱日，英美各處以及上海各敎堂，都準備在今天舉行特別禮拜，俾各個基督徒痛自懺悔反省，祈求神明和發揚天賦的良知，探索光明眞理之路，用意至善。</p>
<p>這事在表面上看來，好像僅僅是一種宗敎儀式，不値得注意。尤其在英國那樣富於宗敎保守性的老大國家，全國訢禱，原不算什麼希罕。可是從另一方面來說，英國現正處於歷史上奈有前例的危急之秋，無諭軍事政治內政外交，一舉一動，關係綦重，豈容執政者隨便措施？古人說：得罪於天，雖祈禱亦屬徒然。英國人向來傳統的帝國主義政策，只顧自己利益，不管別人死活的作風，誰也知道總有「報應」的一天。說得刻薄些，現在還祇是自食其果的開塲，恐怕他們所受的痛苦，將來還要千百倍於此哩。</p>
<p>祈禱的真義究竟是什麼呢？第一要認淸的，訢禱是一種積極的行動，爲基督精神表現的眞正所在；第二，祈禱是精神統一的泉源，求取勝利的要素。個人到了生命絕續之交，國家處於存亡危急之秋，在人爲的各種方法，已盡了最大的努力，最後的一個希望，惟有禱之於天了。這樣的訢禱不過爲應變的臨時的，並沒有獲得祈禱的眞諦。倘若一個人，甚至推廣至整僩社會，整個國家，企求生活上的勝利時，應該把訢禱的精神，攙和在日常生活之中，使生活與訢禱打成一片；把平時的一切希望，一切信仰都建築在祈禱上面。</p>
<p>美國一位商人說，成功的生活應從具有活物的訢禱開始。他以爲祈禱不應當像老和尙念經般「有口無心」，更不宜出以「叫化式」的姿態。因爲一般人——自認爲虔誠基督徒的——往往早晨眼睛一張開便說：「主呀，給我這樣……主呀，給我那樣，」歇了會兒又道：「上帝呀，求你拯救我不做這樣，……求你賜福，使我能做那樣……求你賜給我重大的恩典……」。大家在求道樣，求那樣之餘，却忽略了主禱文中僅僅數字的「願你的旨意成就」一句禱文。</p>
<p>我們且看，「你的旨意」中「你的」兩字，是指祈求者呢，還是指被求者？如果是指祈求者的話，那末讀禱吿文的人，根本就不用去求，只管照着自己的意旨去做好了。吾則就應該把一己擺脫，把自我取消；剷除自私自利的觀念，放出順服神明的虔誠。這樣才是合理的祈禱，才是推己及人的辦法。很有許多具眞實本領的人，却被人家打倒，這爲什麽呢？無非因爲他們過份重視一己的私利，沒有　上合理的祈禱之路，所遇的不過是一種「次等」的生活而已，除了一己小我之外，從來沒有領略到順服生活中的廣大園地。他們的祈禱只是些請求式的是文而已。</p>
<p>所謂「願你的意旨成就」者，不應以毫無生氣似的方式呆呆的等着上帝來「賜」給你一切福氣。應常把被動的「等着成就」，化之以主動的「做」。著名社會改革家狄奧多派克說得好：「善於祈禱的人並不叫上帝來做人的工作，他先祈求悔改，祈求伙斷，然後再祈求行爲——以心，頭，和手一起來懇求。」所以善於合理的祈禱的人，當他禱吿的時候，好像一切都要靠上帝的；及至工作的時候又好像一切都要靠着自己的。所以所求的在天，而是去做的還是在你自己！</p>
<p>際茲歐洲腥風血雨之秋，獨裁者背道而馳的哲學觀念，無非是把「願我的旨意成就」作爲中心而已。然而話又得說回來，像這樣的獨裁者作風，可說天下到處都有，正不必遠求之於歐洲。這班人專門做「損人不利己」的勾當，要是肯把「我的」兩字，代之以「你的」豈不大妙呢。</p>
<p>英國名作家史蒂芬福特在他所作的「我們必要激起英國的力量」一文中說，一個人臨危不懼，肯捐除一己的自私，而願意完成犧牲的。這種力量的來源只有一個。他知道在上次大戰時有兩個英國的高級軍官，曾冒絕大的危險而獲得勛章。其中一個是旅長，平日異常常敬重神明，聖經左右，祈禱之時雙膝跪地。還有一個是空軍將校，一次他聽見許多同伴在討淪神靈問題對於宗敎有些不屑的樣子。這位將校起初默不作聲的側耳聽着，後來他在火爐前面站起來說道：「朋友們，你們的話我都聽見了。我所要說的，就是在這果我總算在年紀方面要比你們叨長些。我自以爲一生堪以自誇的幾件功績，都是由於基督的精神所完成的」。</p>
<p>史蒂芬福特又說，在國家危急之季，基督徒的責任在於激發全國的人心。我們須具有堅決，鎭靜，團結和靈感的精神，堅決的態度，應以神的計劃爲指歸，抱去惡務凈的決心。鎭靜者在基督的愛心之下，一切無擾於中。靈感爲傾聆上帝旨意所必然得到的結果。法國女貞眞德的奇蹟就是由此而來。</p>
<p>英國第一名將納爾遜是篤信祈禱的一個人，他在特拉法爾加之役最後一瞬前，曾在旗艦艙中跪在書桌之前，把他「祈戰勝」的禱文寫在日記中：「願我所敬愛的上帝，爲全歐福利計，賜予我國以偉大光榮的勝利；使每個人深自檢束，無　於國；並於勝利之後，使仁義常存於英國海軍之中。我個人把生命託付於造物主手中，願他的光榮祝福我的熱情，使我得以忠誠報國。我委身順服於神的面前，使我以正義捍衛國家，亞門一。</p>
<p>要之，祈禱卽良善，純潔，正直思想之謂。祈禱之時，當切思所言者何，務使思想成為切實的串實。如是則所祈求者始有力量可言，而此力量乃爲我人身心與精神的一部份。</p>

<h3>美國電影與音樂的消長（續完）</h3>
<p>好了！現在已種戲院一塲開映兩正片，多售出的票子收入，很足以去付另外一部片子的低廉租價費。轉灣角子上的那家戊種戲院老闆，一看他的生意要淸淡了，也連忙效法一塲開映兩部正片。這樣的他學你，你學我，一步步推上去，已戊丁丙……自然也弄釗「首輪」的甲種戲院頭上，爲與「次輸一的乙種戲院競爭起見，也不得不出於一塲連映兩正片之途。專映派拉蒙片一系的戲院如此，狐狸公司一系的各戲院也是如此，於是像傳染病似的，弄得全國都病起來了。</p>
<p>尤其使人傷心的，所謂一塲連映兩片，所映的並不是一部新片搭着一部舊片，現在變本加厲，兩部初次放映的簇新片子，也竟同在一塲中接連着映演了！甚至支加哥有一家戲院，一塲連映二部正片，連預吿片，短雜片等在內，足足要放映六小時之久，而所收的祗是一塲戲的代價！還有甘薩斯一家影戲院，看客們化了一角錢，不但連着三部正片，並且可白吃一頓大菜！至於各戲院的贈品，那更花色繁多了：有茶布，菜刀，茶葉，百科全書，仿眞珠寳，糕餅，冰洪淋，講義夾，字典，咖啡，糖菓剃刀片，銀具，絲襪和哈佛文學全書等。你要是要添置家具，直可求之於電影院了！</p>
<p>看影戲本來是消遙娛樂之事，在目下兩片制盛行之下，大家眞有些視爲畏途了。那一家孩子的家長，願意他們的兒女，坐在不見天日的黑暗中至六小時之久呢？不但枯坐不動，容易疲勞，而且目光受損，得不償失；所以各處家長，寫了許多信，要求縮短放映電影時間。</p>
<p>除了顧客們的厥倦上影戲院外，好萊塢本身也險象環生，好像待決之囚，等待最後命運的到來。除了顧客缺少之外，其他的原因，也有相當之重要。其一，是影片的生產費增高尤其爲明星們的薪水增大，而同時則利益减少。其次，受了戰事影響，銷路不旺。美國電影事業的收入，百分之四十來目國外，因爲歐戰就减少了百分之七，其中百分之三來自白魯賽爾，海牙，阿姆斯脫達姆，羅脫達姆，和安特衛普五處。此外，因爲戰事，投資於電影的金錢也感到短縮。雖然，戰爭對於電影事業，亦有一二帮助之處。因爲現在片子的銷路大部份都在國內，對於外國的顧忌或干涉就减少了許多。從前往往有幾張片子題村和劇情都好，祇因受到政府的勸吿，乃放棄掃製成片</p>
<p>無綫電現已成爲電影的勁敵，「幸福」雜誌最近曾舉行大衆對於此二者間的取舍測騐。結果情願放棄電影而代之以無綫電的，竟佔百分之七十九之多。這眞是一個晴天霹靂！無綫電有三個長處超過電影。（一）無綫電是免費的，除了第一次購收音機，和經常極少數之維持費外，他無雜耗。（二）便利，聽無綫電廣播的人，不必穿城入市，或轉灣抹角，只要安坐在家裏，便好亨受了。（三）富選擇性，愛聽什麼節目，只要一舉手之勞而已。在另一方面講，如果你在電影院中不歡喜那部正在開映着的片子，十人中倒有九人，只好勉强坐在那裏，拚命的要想撈回「血本」，而你對於任何影片，却已種下了惡劣的反響了。這好有一譬，當你已封好了一封信，貼上了郵票之後，你又要重新老盧那信上所寫者時，除了意志十分堅强者外，願意犧牲那郵票的倒不多　哩。</p>
<p>電視的進步，對於電影更多了一層威脅。普通一班都喜歡到戲院去，因爲人類是有合羣性的，不過這是僅僅的一端而已，電影製造者祗有在「求眞」一點上努力，這一點如能做到，却能超過無錢電多多了。</p>
<p>一塲連映兩片的老祖師是麥色鳩雪州哈佛海地方的一家影戲院，時間遠在一九一六年，至於動機，和如何會發生的，那可一概無考了。最初唯一的理由，當不出乎近鄰的一家戲院，節目相同而售個則略低，他自己不願意减價，却叫顧客們出了一塲的價錢，看到兩張片子。這巧妙那近鄰的一家戲院當然也知道的，於是互相效尤，一塲兩片之風於以造成。</p>
<p>在電影事業不穩之秋，幸而美國的音樂近來大爲一般人所注意。本來，因爲無綫電廣播事業的十分發達，美國可說世界上聽衆最多的國家。不過在古典主義，或保守性質的眼光中看來，美國的文化總帶些「銅腥氣」，音樂當然也不能例外。而且說得刻薄一些，美國早被人看爲「不懂音樂的國家」。現在可是一切轉變從前的武斷已不能成立了。羅吉士脫大學，伊斯脫曼音樂院院長亨生博士，更力反此說。他的大意爲：美國在世界音樂敎育上供獻之圾惹人注意者，　爲提倡中學校中的交響樂隊，這是最新，而比較爲人家所不注意的一件事。這音樂界新時代之開始，肇於十二年之前，當時曾在許多中學校中選擇了具有音樂之才的學生，組織成一個三百人的交響樂隊。最初卽由亨生博士指導。音樂的範團本來比較的挾小，而且有尊嚴的氣息，幾百年來，差不多其根基建築於小數特殊階級者的身上，而現在呢，這閉關的風氣業已解放，充分發揮了平民化的精神，美國的男女孩子都能沐得音樂敎育的思澤了。最近數年間，有不少大交響樂均由美國公立學校出身的美國籍音樂家所指揮。而且許多著名的外國音樂指揮家，盛稱今日世界上最偉大的樂曲，咸出自美國作曲家之手。這是美國音樂已爲世入所重視的明證。亨生博士又說，不問事實如何，時間如何久遠，各大藝術家的抱負見解，和我們所獲得的經騐，都是不謀而合，永遠相契的。由於這一種精神上的作用，人類間的柔和，同情，和默契等種種，始能與美的事物，有相互生長之妙，美國的平民化精神，當以此爲指歸。又支加哥工作計劃指揮處成人敎育組組副主任吉氏金氏，主張各人利用餘晷去發展他們的文化活動。注意於男女的性情陶冶，和美育的灌輸，提倡音樂敎育當然也是他所主張中的一部份。</p>

<h3>閒話越南</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>這幾天越南問題充滿了每張報紙的篇幅，使國人對於越南立刻重視起來，越南本爲我國藩邦，後淪為法屬。因此；在這裏把越南的位置，交通，農業，風俗約略的介紹一些，使小朋友們也可在腦海中留下一個深刻的印象！</p>
<p>所謂越南，在政治上分爲東京，（一名北圻）安南，（一名中圻），交趾支那（一名南圻），東埔寨（一名高綿），老撾（一名遼國）五部，法國置總督於東京的河內，副總督於交趾支那的西貢，統轄越南軍民事務。</p>
<p>位置：越南在亞洲的東南部，居印度支那半島東部，它的北面接我國的雲南，廣西，廣東三省，西面與緬甸，泰國（暹羅）爲隣，東面臨東京灣，及我國的男南海，南面濱印度洋，西南瀕暹羅灣，面積相當於我國福建省的四倍大。</p>
<p>交通：越南陸上交通已成鐵路約一千四百餘哩，自河內至西貢的沿海大幹綫已接軌，自海防至昆明，與河內至廣西鎭南關皆築有鐵路。我國東南諸省人要往雲南去，往往取道於滇越鐵路，至於水道方面有紅河（上流爲我國的富良江），其附港爲海防，爲往來船舶必經之地，輸出米，絲，滇越鐵路，由此出海</p>
<p>農產：越南農業最盛，產米著名世界，現在所吃的西貢米，卽從越南來的，除米外，其他的農產品也很多，如麥，棉，烟草，大豆，花生，玉蜀泰，胡椒，茶葉，樹膠，椰子，蔗糖等</p>
<p>越南人容貌酷似我國人，惟軀幹短小而皮色略黑，其語言和我國語言很相接近的，服裝男女一樣，出門都戴上一頂竹篾和棕葉編成的大斗笠，但他們性情驕惰，不知進取。</p>
<h3>一種真正的兒童畫報</h3>
<p>— 亦婴</p>
<p>我這裏要介绍的一種兒童畫報，不是由那一家畫局出版的；卻是由一個小朋友獨辦的。他一個人編，一個人書，一個人寫，也由他一個人出版。的的確確可稱爲眞正的兒童畫報。</p>
<p>有一天，我到一位姓沈的朋友家裏去玩，剛坐定下來，便注意到牆壁上貼的一張彩色畫。上面畫着一本翻開的大書，上半書着圖，下半寫着字。圖中畫着許多飛機，正在那裏交戰。有幾架正從雲中直墮下去，尾巴上拖着一股黑烟，機身上還隱約可以看到小圓紅點的標記。下半的字這　寫：</p>
<p>小畫家哥哥編畫小小畫報</p>
<p>—空戰特大號出版—快來定閱！</p>
<p>定閱費每人每次繳小蘋果一隻，或小香蕉兩隻。</p>
<p>注意—劣貨不收，腐爛的不收。</p>
<p>啊！原來是一幅小小的廣吿。我禁不住向沈先生問：「這是什麼玩意兒？」</p>
<p>沈先生笑笑說：這是他大兒子惠民的玩意兒。惠民很歡喜畫圖，時常東塗西抹。有一次，他忽發奇想，要一個人辦一種畫報。他一個人打主意，畫圖，寫說明，却不許別人看一眼。沒頭沒腦忙了四五天，幾乎連吃飯睡覺都忘了，果然裝釘成一本小小的畫册，定名爲小小畫報。起初定戶不過是他的弟弟，妹妹，後來擴展到</p>
<p>屋子裏的小朋友，鄰近的小朋友，每次居然可以收到十來隻蘋果或香蕉呢。</p>
<p>沈先生隨手從小書橱裏拿出幾本前幾期的畫報，遞給我看。我從頭到底翻了遍，覺得非常有趣，不禁說：「怪不得小朋友們願意送蘋果香蕉給他吃。」</p>
<p>這裏就是小畫報中的一頁</p>
<p>小朋友看了上面的介紹文字，千萬別疑心我是小畫家惠民的推銷員，想替他多拉幾個定戶，也好吃到一兩個蘋果。（他的畫報每期只出一本，供給現有的定戶還不够分配呢，）我不過覺得這是一個好主意，値得介紹給上海小朋友們照着做的：或者一個人獨幹，或者幾個人合作，或者分組各辦一種，互相交換，互相比賽。當此戰時，上海大書局的兒童畫報停出，大家嚷着缺少精神糧食的當兒，小朋友們何不照着惠民的法子，自己來辦幾種眞正的兒童畫報，自己來供給精神糧食，一方面還可以趁此機會練習練習圖畫寫字，作文呢。</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳　（十三）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>可甘，代表的工作，雖然很苦，但是仍有許多女孩子都想來嘗試一下，媽媽每天總得接到本國各地媽媽們的來信，甚至有從歐洲方面寄來的。那些信中都附有伊們女見的照片，信中說道：「我的女兒不是很像秀蘭嗎？伊很願意來做秀蘭的代表，你可能答允嗎？」但是媽媽只能寫信去一一回絕，因爲我早已有了一個代表了。</p>
<p>過了不多時候，爸爸重又回銀行去辦事了。有一天我聽得他對媽媽說，情形並沒有變好，因爲他的薪水，打了一個大大的折扣。他們以爲我不會明白他們的話，所以並不避開我，但是我那兩位哥哥傑克和生南在旁邊，他們就住口不說了。</p>
<p>媽媽想給我向別的影片公司中去找些工作，無奈人家並不怎樣需要我，每一部小影片中，我只須工作一二天就够了。爸爸曾對媽媽說，不必再在影片中打算了。他說我的名下，已在銀行中存了三百金圓，過去一年間，我在七部影片中工作所得，盡在於此，等我長大起來進大學時，大約已够一學期的學費了。</p>
<p>媽媽總替我担憂着不能在攝影塲中有什麽新的發展；伊常常說只要能得到一張合同，可以使我等候機會，在影片中處於一個較好的地位，至於錢的多少，倒是不放在心上的。</p>
<h3>蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>秋天是眞的到了，柳樹上的蟬聲，被一陣陣的秋風驅散得無影無蹤，而換了一隊隊蟋蟀的奏樂聲。庸兒對於蟋蟀是素有好感的。在學校還沒有開學的幾天，已開始在牆壁角隅和潮濕泥地中探聽蟋蟀的行蹤，聽得瞿瞿數聲一響，那隻蟋蟀一定被庸兒邀到他的瓦盆中去作寓公了。每天三餐白版和淸水是不會少的，比了在泥土下吃泥的生活是優裕得多，可是雖享受了權利，庸兒必須有一些義務託付給它，而它對於這義務倒也很肯盡的。那義務是什麽？就是庸兒喜作蟋蟀爭鬥的媒介人，要是他捉到了二隻，便同放在一盆中，看它倆咬牙切齒的爭一個你長我短，只聽得瞿瞿一聲凱歌，就使庸兒心花怒放，快樂得什麽似的。有時那蟋蟀狡滑得很，乘他不備之際便卜的一跳，逃之夭夭，這也難怪它，因爲它天生就一副賤骨頭，不配享受這樣舒適的生活，不過，庸兒的眼中總不免流些眼淚，和它作別，心中還駡它一聲忘恩負義的畜生。</p>
<p>到後來，學校裏也開了學，而他對於蟋蟀的奉承仍沒有怠慢，有一天，他哥哥也走了過來，便開口對他說：「不要玩了蟋蟀，把預備功課的一回事忘了。在現在正當有蟋蟀的時光，看見了蟋蟀，總能得到一些關於昆虫的常識。你可得到些嗎？」</p>
<p>「什麽？我不懂你的話，蟋蟀是蟋蟀，昆虫是昆虫，它們倆有什麽相干嗎？」庸兒一面搖着頭，一面很詫異的說着</p>
<p>「你眞不懂，昆虫又不是一種虫，它包含的範圍大得很，什麼蟋蟀，螞蟻，蒼蠅，蚊子……都是屬於昆虫範圍之內，而蟋蟀是昆虫的一種罷了</p>
<p>你瞧那隻蟋蟀：頭上有一對觸鬚，六隻脚，膜質的翅膀，有頭胸腹三部，身體上有一節節的環節，環節是很硬，係由角質構成，這不過是蟋蟀的外表形態，也可說凡是昆虫都具有的，更可說是昆虫的基本構造。你如不信，可捉個蒼蠅來證明的。道些便是關於昆虫的基本常識，我們必須牢記在心頭。現在有個蟋蟀的玩意兒：你去捉一隻腹部圾膨大的雌蟋蟀，俗呼三米子，因爲它肚中的卵己充分發育。同時拿一隻深五英寸的廣口瓶，瓶中盛了二英寸的泥土，那泥土以乾燥而小含腐葉的爲宜，這樣可防生徽。於是把瓶輕輕搖動，使泥固定，便於產卵。就把雌蟋蟀放在瓶裏，以茄片飼之，時時注意，後來看見那雌者後尾的三根刺，其當中的一根，名叫產卵管揷入土中，那便是產卵，到後來那雌的便死了，把它和茄片一同去掉，於是把瓶加蓋，但不要過緊，中間最好隔一層硬紙，放在房屋的一角，不可直接曝日，等到來年六月初，有沒有小蟋蟀發生？這不是件很有趣的玩意嗎？」庸兒聽完了這話，當然是實地去試騐了。</p>
<h3>耶蘓基督的饒恕精神（一）</h3>
<p>一般人的思想，大槪以爲一個人在吃苦的時候，他所想到的總是自己的痛苦，決沒有工夫再去想別人的。其實人在受苦的時候，若祇想到自己所受的苦，必是越想越苦，越要怨天尤人，覺得別人待他不公道，世上毫無公哩。</p>
<p>耶穌在十字架上的時候，他的心境如何，這是我們各人所願意知道的。倘使耶穌在十字架上，默不作聲，我們就無法知道了，卽使推測，也不過以爲和平常人一樣，同是滿腔怨恨，所謂含寃而死。幸虧四本福音的作者們爲我們保存了耶穌在十字架上的七句話，使我們能够知道耶穌的心境。最使人希奇而佩服的，就是他開宗明義的第一句話，他沒有怨恨人，沒有實備人，也不感　他數年的工作，得到如此結果，倒是說了一句滿有愛心和憐憫的話：「父阿；赦免他們，因爲他們所做的，他們不曉得。（路加二十三34）我們從耶穌這句括上，可分三點討論：</p>
<p>（一）耶穌實踐自己的敎訓：耶穌曾經敎訓人說：「你們的仇敵要愛他，恨你們的要待他好，咒誰你們的要爲他祝福，凌辱你們的要爲他續吿…』（路加六27/29）他如此敎訓人，也如此實行了。一般人的通病，只知道敎訓人，而不知敎訓自己，耶稣却給我們一個良好的榜樣，就是「言顧行，行顧言』。因爲我們不僅應當善於敎訓人，也常敎訓自己。不能敎訓自己的，決不能敎訓人，也決沒有能力感動人。耶穌這句禱吿的話，也沒有定甚麽界限，怎樣的人可以赦免，怎樣的人便不可以赦免。他乃是爲所有的仇敵禱吿，資他的猶大，釘他的羅馬兵，無一不在赦免之列。非但當日的仇敵，就是現在與他爲歒的，也同樣的得着赫免，請問道饒恕的範圍是何等的普及呢？（十一日再登）</p>

<h3>聽播偶感</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>消費高貴，所以極視聽之娛，舍視而聽，收聽播音，却也未始不是最儉約的消閒良法；筆者就在這一個原則之下，和收音機成了唯一良友。但收聽所得，在無意之中，却發見了不少惡劣感想：</p>
<p>最近，一個評話家在播送一家書店的廣吿之中，介紹一種名爲「××艷異記的小說，他說：一這本小說是叙述四川地方的艷聞異事，四川地方的婦女抱着多夫主義，男女婚姻自由，女子三年祇淴一個浴。一這本艷異記的內容怎樣，筆者雖然無從得知，可是就這位評話家所報吿的上述這些一鱗半爪？至少是近乎荒謬絕倫了。那四川是現在行都所在之區，絕不是三數十年前給人認爲神秘的四川，文化水準的提高，自屬意中事，卽較諸今日孤島的頹喪淫糜，當亦不可同日而語。這近乎誣蔑的宜傳，也許是廣吿員故意誘惑，但這位評話家沒有仔細老量過他所介紹的幾句話，會不會發生什麽影響？其實是大堪注意的。</p>
<p>其次，有一位彈詞家在播音中推銷煤球，除了伸述煤球火力的優劣是廣吿必要以外，那位彈詞家却大天口口聲聲說卽日要漲價，譬如「今天是六元八角，到後天準可漲到七元二角」，因此他又大聲地呼喊：聽衆不妨囤積一點。」而且如果聽衆「沒有存放之處，儘可把煤球存給店家，用不了，到漲價時還可代爲銷去。」這彷彿有點像在訓練聽衆習學囤積居奇，今日孤島投機之風正又死灰復燃，在空氣中興風作浪，可也要不得呢！</p>
<p>又如說英烈的某評話家，在說到方國珍歸順明朝時，他說：一方國珍是大丈夫能屈能伸，是識時務者的俊傑」，因而他從兵凶戰危引證到兵連禍結是「祇有造成民衆的顚沛流離，備受苦痛而已。」祗這幾句話，使人聽到也未免覺得刺耳。</p>
<p>本來播音藝員在口沒遮攔的狀况之下，偶而有少許錯誤如說書的口銃等等是小足深責的，但像上述這些謬誤是決不會無法避免的。　　希望播音藝員此沒有則改之，無則加勉，不使貽人口實是已</p>

<h3>國聯大戲院中秋後開幕</h3>
<p>— 羅村</p>
<p>假使各位讀者不健忘的話，一定還記得在不久以前本刊載虞洽卿路的皇宮」將改建國片二輪戲院的消息，但現在決定改爲頭掄戲院。並定名爲「國聯」。一國聯所以要改爲頭掄戲院，據關係方面的可靠消息，不外乎有二個原因：</p>
<p>第一　新華與金城訂立的合同，現已滿期，金城因近來應付國華國泰的出品已足够了，並且說不定還要演「金星」的新片，所以不再與新華續訂合同了。此外新光已有華新的大量出品，而且還要抽日子出來映藝華合衆等的出品，亦有應接不暇之勢，滬光也有華成藝華兩家的片子，並且還兼映二輪西片，所以這二家影院，已沒有新華揷足的餘地了。國聯看到這一點，就想來包辦新華的出品，若有時間可以映藝華積壓着的新片。</p>
<p>第二　「國聯」地位很適中，交通也便利，左右僅有大上海。大光明西片戲院，並且又適居在新光·滬光之間，鼎足而立，所以對於營業上，也具有相當把握的。</p>
<p>「國聯」改建將全部竣工，據負責人說，已決定在中秋節後開幕，開幕第一砲卽是新華的發片「鄉下姑娘」，該片是袁美雲主演，王引導演兼主演</p>

<p>陸健笙說：「霍桑，是一個私家偵探。是不是？那末，這筆費用我可以担任，祇要你們趕快破案。」</p>
<p>霍桑忽慢慢地張開眼睛。「陸健笙！你打算出多少費用？」</p>

<p>「這——這話什么意思！」他的語氣裏有些着惱。</p>

<h3>If Japanese Troops Land in Vietnam, Chinese Troops Will Resolutely Resist. Important Railway Bridges on the Vietnamese Border Have Been Destroyed. Rumor Has It That a Battalion of Japanese Troops Entered Vietnam from Lang Son and Then Immediately Withdrew.</h3>
<p>Chongqing: While the Chinese side's countermeasures regarding Vietnam's permission for Japanese troops to pass through remain difficult to ascertain, the general public, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration on August 18, believes that if Japanese troops were to land in Vietnam, the Chinese troops concentrated on the border would occupy key military points in the northern Vietnamese mountains to resist the Japanese attempt to attack Kunming northwards along the railway from Hanoi. According to the opinions of military experts, important railway bridges in the mountains have been destroyed, and Chinese troops can effectively resist along the border. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: A French government communique recently stated that Japanese troops entered Dong Dang (transliteration) on the Vietnamese border yesterday morning but withdrew at 6 PM yesterday without engaging in combat. Lieutenant General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, visited Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux this morning and expressed deep regret over the incident. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Yesterday morning, approximately one battalion of Japanese troops, led by an officer, crossed the border near Dong Dang (transliteration) in the Lang Son military district without orders from their superiors and entered Vietnamese territory. Fortunately, French military officers maintained a firm and calm attitude, preventing the situation from escalating and resolving it quickly. By the afternoon, all Japanese troops had withdrawn from the Vietnamese border. General Nishihara, the chief representative of the Japanese inspection team, expressed his deep apologies to Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux this morning. (July 7th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Authoritative sources today report that the Chinese National Government has decided to immediately dispatch troops into Vietnam as soon as the Japanese invade any part of Vietnam. However, when the territorial sovereignty of Vietnam has not been violated by the Japanese, Chinese troops will still respect the territorial sovereignty of Vietnam. The Chinese troops will only take this action when the Japanese implement aggression. According to the Ta Kung Pao, 200,000 Chinese troops are prepared to enter Vietnam when the Japanese invade French territory. According to a report from the Central News Agency, to ensure the adaptation of transportation in Vietnam, wireless broadcasting between Kunming and Hekou was opened yesterday. Well-informed sources say that, regarding the Japanese demands, although they have learned of reports confirming that the French authorities have adopted a compromising attitude, discussions between Tokyo and Vichy have not entered the final stage. Regarding the issue of Japanese troops passing through Vietnam, the topics discussed include: first, the number of Japanese troops or naval marines to be allowed to pass through; second, the route that Japan should take; and third, the location where the Japanese are allowed to land. It is said that the road through the mountains is limited to the railway section from Haiphong to Lao Cai, and the branch line between Hanoi and Lang Son. It is also said that there are three locations where the Japanese are allowed to land in Vietnam. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Although there is a rumor from Chongqing that the Vietnamese authorities have allowed 12,000 Japanese soldiers to land at three locations, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that as of now, London has not received news of Japanese troops landing in Vietnam. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: It is rumored that Chinese troops entered Vietnamese territory on the 5th of this month and had a fierce conflict with French border defense forces, eventually being repelled. One person on the French side died and ten were injured. Border defenses have been strengthened since then. (July 7th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Manila: Chinese and foreign figures here are greatly shocked to hear that the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to Japan's request to pass through with troops. They initially believed that the Vietnamese authorities would maintain a strong position and, if they remained unchanged, Japan would eventually withdraw its request and be unwilling to launch an attack on Vietnam at this time. Moreover, with Britain and the United States successively negotiating with Japan to maintain the status quo in the Far East, the Vietnamese authorities' tactics could be strengthened accordingly. Now, the sudden change of plan must be due to German pressure on the Vichy government to force concessions. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the Vietnam issue, the Vietnamese authorities and Japanese representatives are still holding continuous meetings in Hanoi, while the French and Japanese governments are also conducting negotiations in a sincere environment. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has issued a statement to maintain the status quo in Vietnam. According to sources in Tokyo, French-Japanese negotiations, whether in the past or at present, have not involved the status quo in Vietnam. This has been confirmed here. (July 7th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to sources from the Vietnamese responsible parties, France and Japan have agreed on a basic agreement allowing Japanese troops to pass through the Tokyo region only. The Japanese request to use the convenience of airfields has been rejected by the French authorities. Japanese troops are only allowed to land in Haiphong and travel by train through French territory, but may not leave the railway area. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Authoritative neutral sources recently stated that Japan and Vietnam have reached an agreement allowing Japan to pass troops through, use air force bases, and station troops on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Although private sources arriving here say that Vietnam has rejected Japan's request for air force bases, they point out that the Japanese have freely used the Hanoi airport for military and commercial purposes since the middle of last month. Details regarding the conditions for transporting troops are not yet known, as negotiations regarding Japan's various requests are still ongoing in Hanoi. However, sources with difficulty accessing information say that France has allowed Japan to transport troops within certain specific areas of Vietnam and along the railway. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Authoritative sources say that according to British officials, although an agreement has been reached allowing Japan to transport troops through Vietnam, Japanese troops have not yet landed in Vietnam, and are not expected to land within the next few days. Negotiations are still ongoing in Hanoi. The French agreement only allows Japanese troops to pass through the Tokyo region, but the detailed methods of transporting troops are still being discussed in Hanoi. It is also said that the French, in allowing Japanese troops to pass through, stipulated that Japanese troops can only use the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to reach Chinese territory and cannot leave the railway area. It is rumored that the Japanese request to build official air force bases in Vietnam has been rejected by the French. However, authoritative sources strongly say that negotiations are continuing on this point and other issues. According to travelers arriving here from Hanoi, they have not seen any signs of Japanese troops landing. Although there are 20 Japanese people wearing military uniforms at the Hanoi airport, this is not unusual. Moreover, authoritative Chinese sources in Vietnam believe that when the Japanese troops land, they will order some of their troops to disguise themselves as Chinese troops and launch disturbances on the Guangxi-Vietnam border, thereby claiming that they are stationing troops in Vietnam to eliminate so-called "Chinese terrorism".

<h3>Chinese Plainclothes Troops Enter Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Guangdong: Chinese troops from a certain unit disguised themselves and entered Guangzhou on the 1st and 2nd of this month, killing seven Japanese officers, one high-ranking puppet army commander, and over a hundred Japanese soldiers. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Baoying and Gaoyou Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Jiangsu: The Japanese troops in Baoying, Gaoyou, and other places in Northern Jiangsu have recently become restless again. They have launched continuous offensives towards Yongjia Bridge, Wangjia Daniu, and other places, but have been repelled by the Chinese troops who have divided their forces to defeat the Japanese. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. (July 7th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Yiren Passes Away in Chengdu</h3>
<p>Chengdu: Liu Yiren, the Chief of Staff of the Chengdu Provisional Headquarters, contracted dysentery a month ago. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away on the morning of the 6th. Liu graduated from the fourth class of the Army University. When the staff group entered Sichuan, he served as the Chief of the First Division, and later as the Chief of the First Bureau of the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters. He was then transferred to his current position, advising on military affairs with extreme diligence. His sudden death is mourned by all who hear of it. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Eastern Suiyuan Attack and Enter Xinghe County Town, Japanese Troops in the City Almost Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Yulin: Chinese troops in eastern Suiyuan have been extremely active recently. A few days ago, they launched a fierce attack on Xinghe County Town, an important Japanese stronghold, catching the Japanese by surprise. They charged into the city in one go, killing and slashing horizontally and vertically, and almost completely annihilated the Japanese. They seized over 320 rifles and countless other military supplies. (July 7th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Yangquan Fail in Their Western Offensive</h3>
<p>Xingji: Japanese troops in Yangquan on the Zhengtai Railway launched a fierce offensive to the west on the morning of the 29th under the cover of aircraft. They were blocked and attacked by the Chinese troops in the Sangzhang Potou area. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese failed to succeed. Then, a certain unit of the Chinese troops detoured to attack the rear of the Japanese, cutting them into several sections and killing over a hundred Japanese troops. (July 7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the evenings of the 27th and 29th, Chinese troops in southwestern Shanxi launched attacks on Japanese strongholds in the Wenxi and Xiaxian areas, including the mountain pass, Xiaowang Village, Chen Village, Chuanjia Slope, and Wende Village. The fighting was extremely fierce. The Chinese troops, with the momentum of a bamboo split, breached many Japanese positions and annihilated over 300 Japanese troops, seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. (July 7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: A unit of Chinese troops in southeastern Shanxi launched an attack on the Japanese near Lanzhen Town south of Jincheng on the 29th. After three hours of fierce fighting, they killed many Japanese troops and captured many Japanese soldiers from the Nishida Regiment, including Tanaka Katsumi, seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. (July 7th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Publishes Inspection Thoughts</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Jiang Zuobin, the Director of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Group of the Executive Yuan's Political Inspection Group, along with members Duanmu Kai and Wang Nanran, departed on July 16 to inspect the administration of the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. They have now completed their task and returned to Chongqing on the morning of the 6th. They will pay their respects to President Jiang within a few days and report on the inspection. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Jiang to inquire about his thoughts on the inspection. Jiang smiled and told the reporter that what he saw during this inspection—the vigorous economic construction and the rapid advancement of civilian production in the Great Rear—was enough to excite people. In terms of local administration, the three provinces are all vigorously implementing the new county system promulgated by the central government and actively promoting education. However, because the Yunnan Province's Baojia system was implemented later, the implementation of the new county system is expected to be slightly slower, but its swiftness in issuing orders is a unique advantage. The Guizhou Province's anti-smoking administration has achieved the most outstanding results and can be called a model. The economic capabilities and living conditions of the people are more robust and better than in previous years. All of these provinces have had a bumper harvest this year, and their future economic development is limitless. (June 6th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the European Situation</h3>
<p>To say that humans are political animals is an achievement of gradual human evolution; to say that humans are warlike animals is a nature inherited from the primitive. Today's world is an exposure of human nature, leading to mutual slaughter.</p>
<p>Taking Europe as an example, since the opening of the war last autumn, the combat methods of both sides have evolved from the initial submarine and mine warfare of localized slaughter, through airborne and tank warfare, to the current collective slaughter of "London Blitz" and "Bombing of Berlin". Following this deduction, if the victory or defeat cannot be decided early, it is not guaranteed that gas warfare or germ warfare, which people talk about with dread, may also be adopted! In this modern era of academic prosperity and developed human intelligence, such cruel phenomena occur, which cannot but make people feel that culture has regressed by thousands of years!</p>
<p>Regarding the results of this European war, let us set aside the gains and losses of the first four countries to start the war, namely Britain, France, Germany, and Poland; and the naked facts before our eyes are that at least many small countries have been destroyed or dismembered. It is a pity that these small countries themselves have weaknesses, but the foundation of their establishment is peaceful and neutral. People do not offend them, and they will never offend others; this time, in the sound of the expansion of the war, they have become associated victims for the sake of the military or political reasons of several major powers: counting on fingers, in the past year, there have been no less than seven or eight countries occupied or annexed by major powers; and the country that recently encountered such a similar misfortune is the so-called "neutral country" in southeastern Europe with an area of more than 290,000 square kilometers and a population of 20 million—Romania. This is the first victim in the Balkans in this European war. Its territory was not taken by belligerent countries by force, but was divided into two-thirds by three other neutral countries. In other words: the Soviet Union, relying on its own power, demanded Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina; Bulgaria, with the support of Britain and the Soviet Union, requested Southern Dobruja; and finally, Hungary, due to the support of Italy and Germany, obtained Northern Transylvania. This partition movement is nominally to reclaim old land, but in fact it is nothing more than taking advantage of the fire to loot. Of course, Romania, with its complex ethnic composition and factional infighting, usually does not know how to eliminate internal contradictions and strengthen military preparations. Since the European war, it has vacillated between the two major powers and has never had an independent and autonomous response policy: it was expected that it would attract the coveting of its neighbors, and we now have no time to criticize its right and wrong. What we urgently want to study and consider very important, however, is whether this area can be peaceful after this country is partitioned? Regarding this point, I am afraid it is the opposite, that is, the Balkans cannot avoid being more troubled from now on.</p>
<p>Originally, after the outbreak of the war last year, many people believed that the powder keg that would explode first due to its impact would be the Balkan Peninsula; who knew that the matter was not so, but Northern Europe came first, followed by Western Europe, then Africa, and the intricate and complex Southeastern Europe unexpectedly has not suffered from war. But what about the future? The King of Romania has abdicated, the political power has fallen into the hands of the Iron Guard, and from then on, its foreign policy will abandon Britain and lean towards the Axis powers; can all this eliminate the contradictions of the great powers in Southeastern Europe? Observing with cold eyes from the side, one would rather draw the opposite conclusion: that is, if the war between Britain and Germany is prolonged, then, whether from a military and political point of view, or simply based on physics, the scope of the war will inevitably continue to expand in the future. Looking at the entire map of Europe, I am afraid that only this corner of Southeastern Europe is the possible development area of war.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot help but examine the significance of the current stage of the war between Britain and Germany: (1) In terms of Britain, at the beginning of the German-Polish war last autumn, Britain's participation in the war contained the meaning of "upholding justice and raising an army for righteousness," but as it stands, since Britain initially opposed Germany's demand for Danzig and the Polish Corridor, why does it now support Bulgaria's request to reclaim old land from Romania? And since it is said to be against aggression, why doesn't Britain declare war on the Soviet Union and Japan for the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and Poland, and Japan's aggression against China? (2) In terms of Germany, before and after the outbreak of the war last year, Germany flaunted the principle of nationalism on the one hand, and self-defense and resistance to the threat of democratic countries on the other. But at this point, the principle of nationalism has long disappeared, and as for the so-called threat, with today's military strength of Germany and the current situation in continental Europe, Germany is as stable as Mount Tai, people are afraid of him, and no one dares to invade him! Therefore, it is said that the significance of the war between Britain and Germany in the past year has undergone great changes: thoroughly speaking, the current war between Britain and Germany fully shows that it is a war for each other to compete for European hegemony! In our opinion, Europe is small, but can it really not accommodate two or three major powers to coexist? Moreover, one is an island naval power, and the other is a continental land power, and there is plenty of room for each other to give way, complement each other, coexist and prosper together. In Hitler's book "Mein Kampf," Britain was not listed as an enemy country, and he seemed to have blamed William II for not fighting Britain in the last European war.</p>
<p>Of course, making such a suggestion today, when the war between Britain and Germany is difficult to resolve, is tantamount to dreaming, but the reason why we cannot help but still make it is precisely because we deeply feel from the standpoint of this time and place that the current European war is not as clear as the Far Eastern war in terms of consciousness; in other words, the Far Eastern war must be fought, as for the war between Britain and Germany, it could have been avoided. The result of the European war, in addition to both sides suffering, is that many small countries are sacrificed in vain. Moreover, according to historical experience, after each major war, the roots of the next major war are often laid in advance during the peace talks; the past events of the Congress of Vienna after Napoleon's defeat, and the evils of the Paris Peace Conference after the last European war, are lessons from the past. Britain and Germany are both excellent nations. Why don't we see signs of timely awakening? Is it really the warlike nature of mankind that dominates their reason?</p>
<h3>Containing Far Eastern Aggression: US and Soviet Union Are Conducting Talks; British-American Cooperation to Deal with Japanese Threat; Protecting Important Interests in the Far East</h3>
<p>New York: A Washington correspondent for the New York Post stated that, in order to contain Japan's tide of aggression in the Far East, the United States has launched important discussions with the Soviet Union. According to reliable sources in the State Department, the primary purpose of these talks is to prevent Japan from attacking the Dutch East Indies. US-Soviet discussions may lead to a formal or informal alliance between the US and the Soviet Union, but at present, the United States is handling the matter cautiously and has not put forward concrete proposals. However, the fact that the US and the Soviet Union are currently holding talks is a warning to Japan. The repeated meetings between Under Secretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky are discussing this matter. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Well-informed sources say that the U.S. government seems to have adopted extensive actions to counter Japan's expansionist forces in the Far East. It is also said that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky has held repeated negotiations with U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles and will continue after Welles returns from his leave. Well-informed sources believe that the United States is helping Britain persuade the Soviet Union to dissolve its non-aggression pact with Germany. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that, in addition to issuing a statement on Vietnam last Wednesday, the United States will protest to Japan regarding maintaining the status quo in Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. Hull avoided directly answering questions about the protest, but he said that he would not be surprised if "some peaceful governments" took the same action. He said that he believed France has not yet agreed to "some proposals" that could interfere with the status quo in Vietnam. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the Kokumin Shimbun, which often publishes opinions from the military, Britain and the United States are gradually becoming more hardened in their attitude towards Japan. This can be evidenced by the joint note sent by Britain and the United States to the Japanese government, because the British and American governments are eager to maintain the status quo in Vietnam and are greatly concerned about its changes. The newspaper predicts that the "erroneous policy of intervention" jointly carried out by Britain and the United States in the Far East may make the situation in the Southwest Pacific increasingly tense. It then said that Japan cannot suddenly ignore the strengthening of the common front by Britain and the United States in the Pacific region, so it must pay attention to the development of the overall situation and prepare to respond to any events. The Asahi Shimbun said that Japan must be determined to overcome all obstacles placed by British-American cooperation on the road to establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, because this sphere is necessary for Japan's national survival. Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, etc., recently spoke out, advocating that the British and American navies should jointly defeat Japan and Germany, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the Vietnam issue on September 4, and the British Foreign Secretary Halifax's similar statement in the House of Commons the next day, proves the cooperation between Britain and the United States on Far Eastern affairs. After Britain and the United States cooperated in the Atlantic, the United States will actively develop its Far Eastern policy, and Britain's promise not to scuttle its fleet will also allow the United States to not have to worry about Atlantic affairs.

<h3>Singapore Naval Base: Britain Decides to Allow the US to Use It</h3>
<p>Washington: People here believe that extremely complete cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, to protect their extremely important interests threatened by the Japanese government, now exists, but concrete developments must await a more suitable American political atmosphere. The recent British-American agreement is a heavy dose that American isolationists must swallow. The authorities feel that it is best to give it time to digest slowly. Afterwards, Britain-American and America-Australia will again discuss the Far Eastern issue. It is rumored that the issue of the British and American fleets using the Singapore naval port in the event of an emergency, according to the battlefield situation, will also be raised for discussion. Naval officials here are convinced that if the United States needs the Singapore base, it will be available for use by the U.S. fleet. However, if Britain made this suggestion at this time, it would cause misunderstandings, pointing out that Britain is using this to entice the United States to pull chestnuts from the fire for Britain. Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull and Ambassador Lothian and Australian envoy Casey reviewed the entire situation and decided that a gradualist policy was the most appropriate. Hull told people that no concrete methods have been established, nor have any decisions been made. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News stated that the British-American agreement is clear proof of close cooperation between Britain and the United States. However, whether British-American cooperation is limited to the Western Ocean or will expand to the Pacific is still an important question today. Although Britain and the United States are currently focused on the European situation, they must also take closer cooperation in the Far East to protect Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

<h3>US and Australia, Canada, New Zealand Sign Friendship Treaty; Secretary of State Hull Answers Questions: US and Australia May Have Joint Defense</h3>
<p>New York: A friendship treaty between the United States and Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, aimed at promoting peace, was signed today in Secretary of State Hull's office. The treaty stipulates that if any disputes cannot be resolved by ordinary diplomatic methods, a committee should be organized to investigate and prepare a report. After the United States continues the U.S.-Canada joint defense agreement, U.S. Secretary of State Hull was asked whether the U.S. would sign a similar treaty with Australia. Hull replied that he had not heard of this matter at this time, but he could not rule out the possibility in the future. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two Central American Countries Cooperate with the US to Carry Out Defense Plans</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters that the two Central American republics of Costa Rica and Ecuador are fully cooperating with the United States to carry out the Americas' defense plan. The United States is currently not holding negotiations with any country to seek other sea and air bases. After outside parties blamed the president for not disclosing the truth at the press conference before announcing the base lease rights and destroyer exchange, the president took the opportunity to answer questions in a conversation with reporters, saying that when all the official documents are released in the future, people will know that the accusations were made prematurely. He believed that the State Department has decided to release these official documents in about ten years. The President also said that this transaction did not involve any other equipment besides the original gun positions on the destroyers. The President also said that the discussions of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board are currently proceeding satisfactorily. When the President spoke, news from those in close contact with the White House reported that the United States believed that Cocos Island was not suitable as a U.S. sea and air base, and also believed that the French-owned Clipperton Island was not suitable.

<p>New York: Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie yesterday vehemently criticized President Roosevelt for rashly exchanging 50 destroyers for naval bases in the British Western Hemisphere without the consent of Congress. Willkie said, "The President's action without the consent of Congress is an abuse of his power, and it violates the spirit of our legal system. We do not know what he will exchange in the future. Although I strongly support aid to Britain, this action is very inappropriate." He concluded, "If President Roosevelt is re-elected next year, he may exchange the Philippine Islands without the consent of Congress and inform us afterwards."

<h3>German Air Force Adopts New Tactics; London Bombed Seven Times in One Day; Bombs Fall on Suburbs, Many Civilian Casualties; Air Combat Results in Numerous German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: From last night until 1:01 AM this morning (9:01 AM Shanghai summer time), German bombers carried out seven brutal bombings in the London area. Reliable sources say that a total of 46 German aircraft were shot down. Yesterday during the day, the Air Ministry announced that German aircraft attempted to break through the London defense line a total of three times, with a total of 650 German aircraft participating in these attempts. The first time was 300 aircraft, the second attempt involved 200 aircraft that broke through over the coast of Kent, and the third attempt was made at dusk with 100 aircraft. During last night's air raids, many bombs fell on the outskirts of London, killing many civilians. Soldiers were stationed on alert around the area, and ambulances were lined up waiting to load the victims. During the last air raid, multiple large fires broke out and spread widely, but most of the fires were quickly extinguished. It is reported that there were extremely high civilian casualties. Hundreds of incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs fell on a factory and a stable. Several strangely sounding bombs and "Molotov bread basket" type bombs fell in the London area. German aircraft are now using new tactics, dropping flares three times during each bombing run and flying in concealed locations to avoid searchlights. Only when the target is illuminated by the third flare do they drop bombs. Yesterday morning, 100 German aircraft attacked the two airfields in the southeast, encountering terrible anti-aircraft fire. After the anti-aircraft guns fired, British fighters engaged in fierce air combat for about ten minutes before the German aircraft fled. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué this afternoon, stating that the scope of enemy air raids had narrowed this morning. Enemy aircraft attacked a certain airfield in Kent without effect, but a bomb landed nearby, causing some casualties. According to reports received so far, British fighters shot down one enemy bomber and one enemy fighter this morning. There were no British losses. It is now known that another enemy aircraft was shot down yesterday, so the total number of losses is 46. This afternoon, British fighter squadrons intercepted enemy aircraft over the Thames Estuary and shot down an enemy aircraft that infiltrated to drop bombs. The first alarm was issued in London at 3:55 PM this afternoon, but detailed reports of the air raid were not available until 5:00 PM. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, German aircraft attempted to break through London's defenses, suffering heavy losses and failing. In the morning, Spitfire and Hurricane British fighters shot down an enemy aircraft every two minutes. By 10:30 PM last night, 45 German aircraft had been destroyed, and British fighters had only lost 19, with the pilots of ten of them unharmed. Residents of a certain town on the southeast coast gathered in the streets last night to watch the great air battle. British fighter machine guns roared and dove into the formations of German bombers, scattering them. The German aircraft fled out to sea, and at least two crashed into the sea. Two German crew members parachuted out, and a tugboat with a naval surgeon on board went out to sea to rescue them.</p>
<p>At 7:55 PM last night, another air raid alarm was issued in London because German aircraft were approaching the Thames Estuary. British fighters attacked swiftly, and five German aircraft were shot down within ten seconds. The attacking German bombers and fighters numbered several hundred. Witnesses said that there was continuous fierce fighting over a large area of the Thames Estuary, the scale of which had never been seen in the area. According to the Air Ministry Intelligence Office, in one hour of air combat in southeastern England, British fighters shot down more than 20 German bombers and fighters. A squadron of Spitfire British fighters has repeatedly performed outstanding feats recently, and shot down eight Messerschmitt German fighters again this morning, with another two possibly shot down. Yesterday morning, about 300 Junkers bombers, protected by a large number of fighters, attacked in groups of 20 to 30 aircraft, targeting airfields. Most of the air combat took place in Kent and Essex, but some German aircraft were intercepted outside Beachy Head. After the fourth alarm in London was lifted at 10:14 PM last night, a fifth alarm was issued at 10:30 PM. According to witnesses watching the battle from the roof of the Reuters building on Fleet Street, German aircraft attacking the London area last night used a new technique, with one aircraft dropping a cluster of three flares. While the flares illuminated the target, the aircraft flew away to avoid the searchlights, then returned quickly to drop bombs. However, the anti-aircraft guns continued to fire fiercely. It is reported that high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell on several streets in the London area, destroying several houses and causing fires, with some casualties.

<h3>British Air Force Counterattacks; Fierce Bombing of French Coastal Ports; Explosions Shake the Opposite Coast; British Aircraft Break Through Berlin's Defenses and Drop Bombs</h3>
<p>A certain town in southeastern England: People here witnessed yesterday that the intensity of the Royal Air Force's counterattacks against Germany is increasing daily, especially in the area of the English Channel. Royal Air Force aircraft continued to drop heavy bombs in the French Channel on Thursday night and yesterday morning, apparently intending to destroy the German airfields in the area so that German aircraft cannot attack Britain. The sound of bombing in France on Thursday night and yesterday morning was unprecedentedly loud. People in Boulogne and Dunkirk could see the flames when the bombs landed on the opposite shore, as well as the explosions of anti-aircraft shells. Here, the ground shook when the bombs exploded. German anti-aircraft batteries formed a dense "onion-shaped flame," but the bombs continued to fall incessantly throughout the night. In addition, British aircraft also bombed other "major targets" in Germany. Aviation experts here believe that British aircraft have passed the "testing" period and are now in a struggle for life and death to determine the fate of Europe. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Royal Air Force made a violent attack on Berlin. The alarm was issued at 12:15 AM this morning and lifted at 3:00 AM. It is said that most of the British aircraft were driven back before reaching Berlin, but the authorities admit that several aircraft broke through the air defenses and dropped bombs, causing multiple fires. British aircraft came in waves, mostly flying from the Hamburg area. The German government claims that Royal Air Force aircraft were unable to fly low due to being blocked by barrage balloons, so they remained at high altitude. British aircraft also attacked the Ruhr area. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>German Military Communiqué</h3>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday German aircraft bombed important military targets in southern England, including the aircraft manufacturing plants in Rochester and Weybridge, the oil depot in Thameshaven, and the airfield in Cranleigh. Many enemy aircraft were shot down. The targets of last night's German air raids were mainly British naval ports and aircraft manufacturing plants. Liverpool, Manchester, Derby, and various ports on the south coast were heavily damaged. North of Aberdeen, a 6,000-ton merchant ship was sunk. German aircraft also dropped mines in various British ports. Last night, enemy aircraft attacked Berlin, dropping several bombs randomly in the center of the city, causing civilian casualties and damage to private property. Therefore, in retaliation, the German Air Force launched a large-scale bombing of London. The docks in East London caught fire, and the oil depot in Thameshaven also caught fire, with the light illuminating the distance. In total, 67 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, of which 52 were shot down in air combat. German anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy aircraft, and German destroyers destroyed one enemy aircraft at night. In addition, 13 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. In total, from August 1st to August 31st, the German side destroyed 596,500 tons of enemy cargo, of which submarines destroyed 503,000 tons. The cargo destroyed by mines is not included. If the total amount of enemy cargo lost since the beginning of the war is calculated, the amount is astonishingly large, reaching 4,323,000 tons, of which submarines destroyed 2,768,000 tons.

<h3>German Strategy Mysterious and Unpredictable; Rumors of Tunneling Under the Channel to Invade Britain; U.S. Experts Believe This is Impossible</h3>
<p>Washington: Military experts here are quite interested in studying the rumor that Germany may dig a tunnel under the English Channel to transport troops to invade Britain. A telegram quoted German adviser Herr's words, saying that German workers are engaged in building military projects in the English Channel, which made people believe the rumors were true. However, U.S. military experts unanimously believe that this plan is impossible because (1) the project would take too long; (2) even if completed, it would be easily destroyed by bombs or even flooded; (3) it is impossible to build another secret exit, so if the German troops traveling in the tunnel are attacked before reaching British territory, they will not be able to find an exit to hide or escape. Therefore, U.S. experts believe that the rumors of German workers working on projects in the English Channel must be for projects such as building seaports, air force bases, or gun emplacements.

According to a statement issued by TASS, authorized by the authorities, the Hochi Shimbun's report is a complete fabrication from beginning to end, as Stalin has never met with Count von der Schulenburg in the past six or seven months.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Singapore Oppose Southern Expansion Policy; Believe Konoe's Plan Will Not Be Effective; Some Japanese Fishermen Migrate to Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Singapore: Japanese residents in Singapore and the Malay Peninsula oppose Prime Minister Konoe's "southern expansion" program, believing that it will not have the "stabilizing" effect that the Japanese government claims. A prominent business spokesman for the Japanese community here said today that they hope to eliminate the Malay Chinese boycott of Japanese goods and maintain the status quo of peace in the area. The recent arrest of Japanese news reporter Kobayashi has caused unrest among the Japanese community here, but this has now been eliminated. The Japanese side stated that they, about 3,000 people, are law-abiding. Previously, when the police authorities interfered with the Japanese, it was mostly with Japanese people who were on "leisure holidays" in the islands or Japanese people who came here from other countries. In the past five or six years, there have been few instances of the authorities paying attention to Japanese residents on the island. The authorities occasionally do not allow Japanese people who have returned to their home country for short vacations to return to this country. Japanese people have a long history of residing in Malaya, but their organizations for sharing the benefits of mining and agriculture only began in 1920. The former Japanese Consul General in Singapore admitted that Japanese people were sometimes seen as suspicious characters. He said that this may be because the Japanese were unable to get along with the non-Japanese people in the area. Although Japan's commercial interests in Singapore are mainly in rubber, tin, coconuts, vegetable oil, and shipping, Japanese companies own two large iron mines on the Malay Peninsula, producing the best iron ore. Last year, 2 million tons of iron ore were shipped to Japan from there. Bauxite, used to make aluminum and aircraft, is also mined by the Japanese on the Malay Peninsula. The Japanese also own rubber plantations, but they still purchase the rubber and tin they need on the market. Although the Malay Peninsula is a favorable market for Japanese manufactured goods, it is not an important market, as the island only has a population of 5 million. Java, with a population of over 40 million, is more important than the Malay Peninsula. Singapore is a Japanese fishing center. Japanese fishing boats departing from here go as far north as Burma and as far south as Darwin, Northern Australia. When part of the fishermen's licenses were revoked by the Singapore authorities, most of the Japanese fishermen moved to Malaya to engage in iron ore mining, because the Chinese there were unwilling to work for the Japanese to produce raw materials for weapons. The remaining Japanese fishermen moved to Hainan Island, which was newly occupied by the Japanese army. The island has now been designated as a fishing territory to replace Singapore's position. The current value of the Japanese fishing industry in Singapore is 1 million Singapore dollars. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Reorganization of the Pétain Cabinet; Number of Ministers Limited to Eight to Participate in Council of Ministers; Ministry of National Defense Abolished, Weygand Appointed to Another Important Position</h3>
<p>Vichy: The cabinet held a meeting at 5:00 PM today, and all ministers immediately submitted their resignations to Chief of State Marshal Pétain. By 6:30 PM, Marshal Pétain had completed the reorganization of the new cabinet. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Chief of State and Prime Minister: Marshal Pétain (incumbent); Deputy Prime Minister: Laval (incumbent); Minister of Justice: Alibert (incumbent); Minister of the Interior: Peyrouton (new appointment); Minister of Foreign Affairs: Baudouin (incumbent); Minister of Finance: Bouthillier (incumbent); Minister of the Navy: Admiral Darlan (incumbent); Minister of the Army: General Huntziger (new appointment); Minister of Aviation: General Bergeret (new appointment); Minister of Education and Youth: Ripert (new appointment); Minister of Agriculture and Food Supply: Caziot (incumbent); Minister of Labor and Industry: Pétain (formerly Minister of Production); Minister of Transportation: Fédérale (new appointment); Minister of Colonies: Rear Admiral Platon (new appointment).</p>
<p>Among them, in addition to Marshal Pétain, Laval, Alibert, Peyrouton, Baudouin, Bouthillier, Darlan, Huntziger, and Pétain are ministers, while the others are ministers but not cabinet members, responsible for handling administrative affairs and various issues that do not need to be submitted to the Council of Ministers for discussion. The original Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Youth and Family have been abolished. Deputy Prime Minister Laval will now be responsible for coordinating matters among the ministers and presiding over intelligence affairs, with even greater power. Among the new cabinet members, Army Minister Huntziger served as Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in the Near East and conducted armistice negotiations with Germany and Italy. Minister of Education and Youth Ripert was the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris, and Minister of Transportation Fédérale was the Deputy Director of the National Railway Administration. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Romanian King Grants Dictatorial Powers to New Prime Minister; Civil and Military Officials Pledge Allegiance to the King; Two Major Parties Agree to Cooperate with the New Government</h3>
<p>Rome. Romanian King Michael issued a decree yesterday stating: (1) I authorize General Antonescu with absolute authority to handle Romanian state affairs; (2) The King possesses the following privileges: He is the commander of the armed forces, has the power to mint currency, issue orders, receive and appoint ambassadors and ministers, approve and amend national laws, and appoint the prime minister and grant him full authority. The difference between this decree and the decree issued by King Carol on December 5, 1939, is that it does not mention the King's power of amnesty, nor the power to conclude treaties and appoint cabinet ministers and deputy ministers. (July 7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome. It was learned here this morning that after the territorial cession matters are completed, around mid-month, the Gigurtu cabinet will continue to govern under the leadership of General Antonescu.

Soldiers of the navy and air force had already taken their oaths yesterday, expressing allegiance to King Michael I. (July 7th Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome. Yesterday morning in Rome, members of the Iron Guard attempted to break into the residence of former Prime Minister Arghezi, exchanging fire with two guards outside the gate, killing them. No disturbances have occurred there since. Romania is currently without a government. The National Peasants' Party, led by Maniu, and the Liberal Party, led by Bratianu, have both agreed to cooperate with Antonescu, but only on the condition that Antonescu agrees to establish a constitutional and parliamentary government. (July 7th Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome. Dictator and Prime Minister General Antonescu yesterday ordered Iron Guard members to cease their riots. At the time, these pro-National Socialist party members were marching through the streets of the capital, destroying Jewish-owned stores. Iron Guards were deployed in large numbers throughout Rome, entering stores and forcing shopkeepers to hoist the Romanian national flag to celebrate the King's abdication and his son Michael's succession. At the same time, the new Prime Minister held meetings with various political leaders to form a new cabinet. Since the new King's ascension, after issuing a proclamation, the Prime Minister has obtained unlimited power. Radio Rome broadcasted that the Prime Minister had appointed General Niculescu as Minister of the Navy, and Mosu as Minister of Transportation and Director of Railways. According to the radio, the mayor of Rome, Dobrosescu, has been dismissed. At the same time, the radio officially announced that the Privy Council, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has taken all steps to withdraw troops from Outer Transylvania. The new King Michael was sworn in at 9:30 AM yesterday, only four and a half hours after his father's abdication. The oath was read to Prime Minister Antonescu, Foreign Minister Manoilescu, Interior Minister Popescu, Justice Minister Gruia, and Propaganda Minister Cranea. Therefore, many political observers believe that these individuals will be part of General Antonescu's future cabinet. (July 7th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Personnel Establishes Provisional Measures for the Appointment of Civil Servants During Extraordinary Times; Agencies May Raise Statutory Appointment Qualifications If Special Needs Arise</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there have been many changes in the political situation of the central and local governments, and all civil service appointment regulations have had to be adapted in practice. The Ministry of Personnel has previously formulated ad hoc measures from time to time. For example, county magistrates in war zones can be appointed by personnel with military knowledge and county administration experience, and police officers in war zones can be appointed by military officers who have served in the police force, without being restricted by the seniority requirements of the Police Officer Appointment Regulations. All these measures were intended to encourage talent, adapting to the times and local conditions. The Ministry of Personnel has recently referred to past precedents and considered recent facts to formulate provisional measures for the appointment of civil servants during extraordinary times to adapt to the current special circumstances and to supplement the deficiencies of existing regulations. The main points of these measures are as follows: (1) Central or local agencies may deem it valid if there is a need to raise the standards or impose necessary restrictions on the statutory qualifications of civil servants due to special affairs or circumstances. (2) If it is truly difficult to apply statutory qualifications to civil servants in war zones, the competent authority may consult with the Ministry of Personnel on the standards for appointment based on the knowledge, experience, skills, and physical strength necessary for the job in order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance, and those who meet the standards may be assigned accordingly. (3) If past certificates are lost, the competent authority or the superior competent authority may issue a certificate, or two current civil servants of the recommended rank or above may provide a certificate. (4) If a school graduation certificate is lost, the directly responsible educational administrative authority may issue a certificate. (5) Civil servants appointed in war zones who cannot submit their applications for review on time due to special circumstances may have their review and acting periods extended upon approval by the Ministry of Personnel. (6) When a civil servant who has passed the personnel review is reassigned to a position with the same qualifications, they may be exempted from filling out an appointment review form and report to the Ministry of Personnel by telegram for record.

<h3>Churchill Reports on the War Situation</h3>
<p>The air war we have discovered is very different from what we had envisioned before the war. Over the past year, there have been a great many empty beds in military hospitals, exceeding 150,000. So far, we feel that the air war is not as serious as we were prepared to endure. In August, 1,075 British civilians died in air raids, with slightly more seriously injured. Even if we lose two or three times more than this, compared to the main issues at stake, no one would call it serious. In August, in addition to minor damage that can be repaired, approximately 800 irreparable houses were destroyed, the Prime Minister continued. The insurance plan for house bombing losses should continue to be studied, and immediate relief should be given to those with low incomes. Those with annual incomes of 400 pounds with dependents and those with incomes of 250 pounds without dependents should be given relief equal to the full amount of their losses. At the same time, the Ministry of Health is now preparing to assist the authorities in coastal evacuation areas with rental matters. (June 6th Reuters dispatch (Continued)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Tea Export Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Zhejiang Tea Communication published by the Zhejiang Tea Bureau reports that since Chinese goods cannot be exported via Hong Kong, the Hua authorities have decided to export tea along the Northwest Highway to the Soviet Union. Tea exported to the UK, USA, Morocco, and Southeast Asia will be shipped via Shanghai. The amount of tea secretly shipped from Zhejiang to the occupied areas has decreased since the price of tea in Shanghai fell. Last year, a total of 10,000 piculs of tea were shipped from western Zhejiang to the occupied areas, but this year it is more than 6,000 piculs, mostly due to the difference in tea prices between the inland and the occupied areas. Last year, the price of tea in Shanghai was 270 yuan, while the government's purchase price in the inland was only 90 yuan. Tea from western Zhejiang was mostly secretly shipped to Hangzhou and Guangde. This year, the government's purchase price of tea has increased by 13%, and then increased to 15%, while the purchase price in various occupied areas of Shanghai has increased by 16%.

<h3>Random Talks on the European War (3) The Eve of War: British Civilian Life</h3>
<p>A "water bridge" is what is called where a canal passes under a road. These "water bridges" were built 150 years ago and are truly engineering marvels. We passed under many brick "water bridges" on the Grand Canal, built when Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo. Others have been rebuilt with reinforced concrete, forming semi-circles spanning new roads. As the boat passed, we heard long-distance buses rumbling under the bridge, creating a rather unusual sensation.</p>
<p>It was July, and dawn in England came quite early. Around three in the morning, the secluded woods were already filled with the chirping of birds. The birds gradually responded to each other, eventually leading to a chorus of hundreds of birds, their melodious and lilting songs being especially pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>One day, after finishing breakfast, we saw a barge loaded with a very high stack of wood trying to pass under an old bridge, but it couldn't go forward or backward. Most canal bridges in England are arched, made of brick. Although they are old and covered with moss, they are still exceptionally sturdy, rarely requiring repairs. A bridge near Witton, built in 1800, was originally used for livestock passage. Today, the road between London and Birmingham also passes over this bridge, with frequent traffic and trucks weighing up to fifteen tons passing through constantly, which shows its sturdiness.</p>
<p>Leaving the London area, most of the locks are unattended. Therefore, each boat carries a crank. Upon approaching a lock, a child usually runs ahead to use the crank to open the lock and let the boat pass. I saw a girl opening a lock with the crank without any difficulty. When I tried to open a lock for the first time, I made many mistakes and spent a lot of effort before finally getting the lock open. After a while, I became familiar with the process and could use the crank as skillfully as a boat boy.</p>
<p>Canal boatmen pass down their profession from generation to generation. When the Grand Canal Company was established and the canal was put into use, four hundred barges were added, but there was a severe shortage of boatmen. Eventually, sailors from the sea were recruited to drive the new barges. However, because they were not used to it, collisions between boats and locks were frequent in the narrow canals, and it took a long time before things ran smoothly.</p>
<p>The English countryside is characterized by rolling hills, unlike the flat plains of the Netherlands and northern Germany, which are more suitable for canal transportation. We gradually ascended, passing through forty-five locks, and then sailed on the Chiltern Hills at an altitude of about four hundred feet. The Grand Canal meanders through the highlands in three places.</p>
<p>On both sides of the canal, we often saw anglers, all taking it very seriously, sitting quietly by the riverbank, staring intently at where the fishing line entered the water, without moving for hours. They may have simply been sitting by the riverbank away from home to bask in the sun, as it was rare to see them catch any fish. The small boat we were driving was rarely seen by the English, but the anglers paid no attention to it. The single-mindedness of the English is the secret to their success.</p>
<p>Further ahead, the river became higher and the water clearer. Later, we arrived at Rickmansworth, to visit the Walker shipyard. Mr. Walker, the owner of the shipyard, guided us through the canal ship construction process. The shipbuilding is done with teak, which is hard in nature and becoming increasingly scarce, as the developed shipbuilding industry in England is unable to meet the demand. Canal ship construction and repairs are all done with exquisite craftsmanship. Mr. Walker said that shipbuilding must be strong, otherwise, future repairs to the factory would affect its reputation.</p>
<p>Rural boatmen still maintain the traditional hardworking spirit of British laborers. When I went to a village to have my shoes repaired, the shoemaker described the shoe repair process in great detail, as if I had asked him to rebuild a battleship.</p>
<p>The next day, Saturday, city residents came to the countryside for excursions and camping. Many people stopped to chat with us at the tents we had set up by the roadside. London's trains and long-distance buses did a lot of business for weekend countryside trips. Some went five or six miles from the city, while others went more than fifty miles away and returned several days later. Tourists carried guidebooks, so they didn't have to worry about getting lost, and they could freely walk through private fields and pastures, as long as they didn't stray from the path and trample on the crops, they wouldn't be chased away.</p>
<p>The tents we set up in Batchworth were located at the confluence of the railway, the road, and the canal. It was Sunday, and cars and bicycles were constantly passing by, with an average of six hundred vehicles passing by per hour. Every five minutes, a certain railway line brought a batch of tourists from London, crowding together and making a lot of noise. In addition, canal barges loaded with steel traveled north to Birmingham, the engines were rumbling, and the lock gates were opening and closing, all kinds of noises mixed together, and it never stopped all night.</p>
<p>The lock keeper at Batchworth Bridge, seeing a boat passing, would ask in detail about the cargo, the names of the captain and owner, and the destination, recording everything. He told us that an average of eighty barges passed through each day in pairs. His great-grandfather had been guarding the lock since 1794, and three generations had inherited the job, fulfilling their duties, never receiving a penny from the government. Now it was the fourth generation.</p>
<p>We went ashore and wandered around the lock, seeing two pairs of boats coming at the same time. So we asked the lock keeper which boat could pass through the lock first. He replied that the first to arrive should pass first, but sometimes it was impossible to say for sure which boat had arrived first.</p>
<p>This time, two boatwomen were arguing over who should go first, neither willing to give way, causing the bows of the two boats to squeeze into the lock entrance at the same time, making it impossible to pass. The lock keeper hurriedly waved to the boat that he thought had arrived later. After a long standoff, one of the boatmen, impatient with the argument, shouted to the other boatman: "Come on, friend, let's go ashore for a beer and let the wives solve it."</p>
<p>A canal repair supervisor, whom we had known for a short time, invited us to leave the lock and visit his garden, which immediately felt exceptionally quiet. He loved to talk about flowers, and I couldn't help but think of two types of Englishmen who were completely different: one who focused on cultivating a small garden, striving to make all kinds of flowers bloom; the other who was adventurous, crossing continents, trekking across oceans, enduring heat and cold, to protect the great British Empire founded by his ancestors.</p>
<p>Leaving Batchworth and going upstream, we passed through Cassiobury Park, where the grass and trees were lush and green. The National Trust had purchased many scenic areas for preservation, and Cassiobury Park was one of them. The English, who love nature and enjoy sightseeing, strongly support this kind of preservation of scenic spots for public enjoyment. Therefore, the Trust has purchased many forests, lakes, mountains, castles, and villages, considering them public property and preserving them forever.</p>
<p>Late in the day, we passed the sixty-fifth lock and reached Cowroast on the Chiltern Hills, which is 393 feet above sea level, the highest point of the Grand Canal. The inn there was full of boatmen, either playing darts or drinking beer. Near the locks, there were usually public places for boatmen to rest.</p>
<p>We camped a mile past Cowroast. Suddenly, an uninvited guest闯came, asking us directly where we were planning to go. He was also an American, who had originally planned to stow away on a train to cross England, but failed, so he decided to walk.</p>

<h3>Unwilling to Change the Decision on Defense Forces, the US Decides to Take Over the Defense of the Central District, Admiral Hepburn Held Meetings Continuously Yesterday, and Returned to Qingdao by Ship in the Afternoon After the Matters Were Completed</h3>
<p>Admiral Hepburn, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, suddenly arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the 4th. During this brief period, he held several meetings with the US Acting Consul-General Mr. Butler and Colonel Baker, commander of the 4th Marine Regiment, to review the general situation in the Far East and discuss the issue of defense zones, making a decision. Hepburn, having completed his official duties in Shanghai, left Shanghai for Qingdao on the US ship Marblehead at 2 PM yesterday. He plans to return to Shanghai on the flagship Augusta in late September. Yesterday morning, around 10 AM, before Hepburn's departure, Colonel Baker and US Consul Butler held another meeting to discuss the various issues of the US military's preparation to take over the defense of District B. Since the Japanese military has already dispatched troops to patrol District D, effectively controlling the area, it is necessary for the US military to take over the defense of District B. Therefore, there will be new developments in the issue of defense zones in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The US is Willing to Abide by the Decision on Defense Forces</p>
<p>Yesterday, authoritative sources firmly stated that Hepburn assured his subordinates in Shanghai that the United States would not agree to any changes to the decision made by the Defense Forces Committee regarding the issue of defense zones. The reason why the Japanese military has not formally taken over the "D" district in western Shanghai is that the negotiations between the US and Japan on the issue of defense zones have stalled. Therefore, it is believed that the US 4th Marine Regiment will soon take over the defense of the Central District. The current garrison in that district, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, is originally provisional in nature. However, at the same time, news from the Japanese side firmly claims that the US defense forces will not undertake this task.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Has Already Controlled District D</p>
<p>It has been a week since the Public Concession and the French Concession jointly implemented special security measures. It was said that they would be lifted soon, but after the incident on the day before yesterday in which bandits on Yu Yuan Road attempted to attack Deputy Chief Inspector Yao Ke of the Municipal Council Police Department, this kind of security measure may be extended after "September 18th". The security situation in the two concessions is also quite tense. Japanese military police randomly conduct inspections of pedestrians and vehicles passing by, and the inspections are even stricter at 3 locations: Brillant Road (west of Zhaofeng Park), Yu Yuan Road Yi Ding Pan Road, and Yu Yuan Road Di Feng Road. Each location is guarded by four Japanese military police and puppet police. The Japanese side has also set up military police headquarters at the Hualegong gambling den on Great Western Road and No. 834 Yu Yuan Road, both guarded by four Japanese military police in front of the door. Military telephone lines have also been erected along the road there, and the work is quite busy.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Labor-Management Dispute Remains Unresolved; Management Declines Labor's Demands</h3>
<p>Approximately two thousand workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company submitted a request to management on July 6th of this year, seeking improved treatment. The contents included: (1) Management must not dismiss workers without cause; (2) Management must improve workers' treatment as much as possible based on the cost of living index; (3) Daily working hours should not exceed eight hours; otherwise, it will be considered "special work" (special work will be calculated at one and a half times the original hourly wage, and special work lasting less than one hour will also be counted as one hour); and work in the traffic department will be limited to eight hours and no longer increased; (4) Work should cease on Sundays, with one day off granted and wages paid as usual; workers working on Sundays will be paid double; (5) Year-end bonuses should be increased from 5% to 10%, and other various demands, totaling 23 items.</p>
<p>Workers Dissatisfied with Management's Response</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter learned that management has responded to each of these requests. The most important points include: (1) The company has never dismissed employees without cause, but reserves the right to dismiss those who are incompetent or have improper behavior; (2) The company has automatically increased cost-of-living allowances and rice subsidies, based on fluctuations in rice prices, making treatment better than other companies in Shanghai; (3) Regarding eight-hour workdays, it was originally agreed by both parties, but the traffic department inevitably exceeds it due to complex circumstances, while the mechanical department has never exceeded eight hours; even if overtime is unavoidable, wages are added according to regulations; (4) Regarding holidays, the company already has a regulation of granting one special day off for every nine days worked, and five days off for the Lunar New Year, but since fares for Sunday riders are not doubled, it is difficult to calculate double wages for those who work on Sundays; (5) Annual general wage increases should be based on the company's "Professional Creed", etc. The labor side is not satisfied with this response.</p>
<p>Professional Creed Sparks Dispute</p>
<p>Yesterday, the labor side claimed that this labor-management dispute was actually caused by the company authorities forcing all workers to sign the "Professional Creed" a few months ago. This creed requires filling out a detailed resume and agreeing to the following rules: (1) Wage increases are at the company's discretion, and if my health interferes with my work, I will unconditionally resign automatically; (2) "The company's articles of association may be modified at any time, and I shall absolutely obey them." The labor side believes that accepting the company's creed is tantamount to being at the mercy of management in everything hereafter, and individual lives will be even more insecure. Hence, the aforementioned request for improved treatment was made.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Response to National Savings Campaign in Shanghai; Savings Bonds Purchased Reach Approximately One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a letter to the public, calling on the people to practice thrift and national savings, the public in this city has expressed excitement and responded enthusiastically, earnestly promoting national savings to cultivate a frugal lifestyle and achieve the goal of national construction. Furthermore, given the abundance of idle capital in this city and the opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to hoard and speculate, violating the law and harming people, relatives and friends are universally advised to participate in the national savings campaign and to quickly purchase savings bonds or deposit them in banks and post offices, benefiting both themselves and the country, achieving two goals with one action.</p>
<p>Millions in Bonds Purchased; Savings Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Since the National Government promulgated the National Savings Regulations and designated the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to issue National Savings Bonds, all provinces, cities, and counties across the country have universally promoted them. Although Shanghai has not been ordered to issue them due to its special environment, all sectors believe that saving is beneficial to the future of national construction and themselves. It is understood that the purchase of savings bonds through the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and various banks has reached approximately one million yuan. In addition, postal savings have also increased sharply compared to before. The commendable virtue of national savings is now being continuously promoted and developed. National Savings Bonds are divided into two types, A and B, with denominations of five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. These savings are designated for investment in national construction and semi-industrial projects, which are highly secure and offer relatively generous interest rates.</p>
<h3>Memorial for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Hardship on the Anniversary; Silence Observed by All Sectors, Resolve to Emulate His Spirit and Complete the Resistance and Reconstruction; Intensified Efforts to Raise Funds for Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's first uprising, as well as the combined anniversary of the Central Government's designated October 11th Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's London Hardship and June 16th Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Hardship, thus it is of great significance. However, all sectors in this city, being in a special environment, cannot hold commemorative ceremonies. Nonetheless, in remembrance of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's arduous efforts in building China and the difficulty of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's autocracy, they have decided to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, emulate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, and complete the great task of resistance and reconstruction. At that time, a silent memorial will be observed. All sectors are also aware that with the imminent arrival of winter, the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the compatriots in the rear who have suffered from the disaster urgently need winter clothing. Therefore, the movement to raise funds for winter clothing will be intensified.</p>
<h3>Business Corps Receives Notice to Detain Three Vehicles; Members Pay Full Attention, Then Order Is Rescinded</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that members of the International Business Corps stationed in the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession suddenly received notice this morning (the 7th) to prepare their weapons, as the Public Concession Police Department requested their assistance in arresting three cars in the western Hongkou district. According to the police notice, the licenses of the three cars were 7995, 5662, and 11717. It is believed that the last car belongs to a certain Russian Jew, but the identity of the owners of the other two cars is unknown. The initial notice received by the Business Corps members was to detain these three cars upon sight. If the cars disobeyed the order to stop, they were authorized to shoot if necessary. However, a second notice was subsequently received from the police, rescinding the previous order.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the French Municipal Council Resigns and Returns Home</h3>
<p>To Depart on the 10th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that it was learned from official sources yesterday (the 6th) that the Chairman of the French Municipal Council, M.J. Brediam, has resigned and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for France last Tuesday. His successor has not yet been appointed.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Deals with the Aftermath of the Bombing</h3>
<p>Regarding the various circumstances of Ningbo dealing with the aftermath of the bombing, the Zhejiang provincial organizations in this city received a telegram yesterday: (1) The bombs at the three locations – in front of the Xinbao Huamen on Luotang Bridge Road, inside the bamboo fence on the east side of the cold storage, and in the middle of the Yuelai Lane Heji Longan Shop – have not detonated. The bomb in front of the Xinbao Huamen has been found in the soil about five feet below the ground after days of work and can be retrieved yesterday. The bombs on the east side of the cold storage and in Yuelai Lane are said to have expired and will not explode.</p>
<p>Continuing to Unearth Bodies</p>
<p>(2) Since Ningbo suffered two devastating bombings by Japanese aircraft the day before yesterday, Zhangqi Lane has suffered the most damage and has the most deaths. Three more bodies were unearthed from the rubble yesterday. The names were identified as Ye Anshun, Ye Hesheng, and Ye Wensheng, all of whom died from being crushed. The wife of Xiaohua, the owner of the Sanxing Tea Garden on Zhenming Road, is missing and is rumored by neighbors to be buried in the rubble, so excavation is being intensified. In the rubble inside No. 3 Wutai Lane, the body of a sixteen-year-old girl named Chen Yinfeng was also unearthed the night before last. (3) In view of the bombing situation on the 4th, the people of Ningbo were on high alert. Starting at dawn the day before yesterday, they dispersed to the countryside, and the prosperous city became deserted. They did not return to the city until all the lights were on.</p>
<p>Raising Funds to Provide Coffins</p>
<p>(4) The two bombings of various districts in the city on the 4th caused severe disaster. Many of the affected compatriots are poor people. Therefore, they cannot afford to buy coffins and cannot complete the funeral arrangements. The situation is too tragic to bear. County Magistrate Yu, therefore, together with Zhou Dalie, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, raised 2,000 yuan and also allocated 2,000 yuan from the Relief Association for Compatriots Affected by the Xiaozai Disaster, totaling 4,000 yuan, and ordered the heads of various branches and the police to order coffins from coffin shops, all of which were stored at the Baiyun Bridge Relief Center outside the West Gate for bereaved families who could not afford coffins to claim and complete the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Investigation of French Concession Housing Rental Situation Concluded</h3>
<p>Major Landlords and Sub-Landlords Exploiting; Rent Council Determined to Curb It</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that yesterday (the 6th), it was learned from M. Corguier, Chairman of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee (Legal Advisor to the French Municipal Council), that the Chinese, French, and Russian groups of the Committee have submitted extremely detailed reports on their investigation of rental housing and rents to the Council. The British and American groups will also submit reports soon. Once all the reports have been completed, the investigation of the rental housing problem and the customs of the Chinese regarding rental housing will be concluded. The Committee will then hold a plenary session to carefully study the reports and submit recommendations to the French Consul-General in Shanghai. The reports are very long, and it is impossible to summarize the main points. It is impossible to predict what the Committee will decide when it holds a plenary session. It is hoped that the Council's resolutions, once approved by the French Consul, will be issued by the French Consulate and implemented in the French Concession, applying to all residents regardless of their nationality. Corguier reiterated the Committee's determination to curb excessive rent increases, the collection of gratuities, and the practice of forcing tenants to buy furniture at fixed prices. He hopes that the Committee can eliminate such exploitation of residents and control subletting, preventing sub-landlords from demanding excessive prices.</p>

<h3>Draft for Shanghai Western Special Police Completed; Bao Wen Concludes Study; Opinion Paper Prepared for Consideration and Approval by Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Police Chief Major Bao Wen has completed his study of the proposal for the Shanghai West Joint Police Force presented by Fu Xiaoan. He has prepared a response opinion paper to submit to the Secretary General of the Municipal Council, Fei Lipu, for further consideration by the Council. It is believed that the Municipal Council will send a final response to Fu next week, as both sides have reached an understanding on the more important details related to the establishment of the police force. When asked if both parties would sign an agreement soon, Fei denied it, saying that he could not say whether the criticisms contained in Bao Wen's response would lead to a previously resolved issue. Bao Wen's response will be submitted to the Municipal Council for a final consideration of the matter before replying to Fu. Regarding the meeting of police chiefs of the two concessions and the "municipal government" proposed two weeks ago, it is said that the meeting will be convened soon according to Bao Wen's wishes.</p>
<h3>Kidnapped Jin Benren Rescued</h3>
<p>Near Kangjia Bridge on Kangnao Road in western Shanghai, a person driving a private car to the area on the morning of the 5th. Suddenly, several bandits rushed out from the roadside, blocked his way, and threatened him with guns. As a result, they robbed him of more than ten yuan in legal tender and forcibly seized his private car, leaving in a hurry. Afterward, the victim immediately reported to the nearby concession police post to pursue the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Police Pursue</p>
<p>However, since the area belonged to an extra-settlement road, the police could not exercise their duties. He then reported the situation to the nearby puppet "police station." Several armed puppet police officers rushed to the scene and conducted a house-by-house search of the nearby slums in an attempt to apprehend the bandits. When they searched a flat behind the World Funeral Home, they intended to knock on the door and enter to investigate the bandits' whereabouts. Unexpectedly, after knocking on the door several times, a cry for help was heard from inside. The puppet police were surprised to know that something was amiss and immediately</p>
<p>Broke Down the Door</p>
<p>The bandits inside, knowing that things were not going well, opened fire to resist arrest. A battle then broke out, with both sides exchanging more than ten shots. As a result, the bandits ran out of ammunition and were arrested. A person lying on a straw mat on the ground was discovered. It was the kidnapped rice merchant Jin Benren, who loudly called for help. He was then rescued from danger.</p>

<h3>Winds Were Quite Strong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The observatory reported at 6:00 a.m. yesterday that a Pacific hurricane is currently located at 23 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, moving very slowly and still heading north-northwest, having reached the southeast of Okinawa. The tentacles of the hurricane's vanguard have now reached this city. Therefore, there have been irregular sporadic rains since yesterday morning, and the clouds are thick, causing the weather to be uncertain. Another hurricane in the Pacific Ocean had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 140 degrees east longitude at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, heading north-northwest. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, the high tide in the Huangpu River can recede to below one foot starting today (the 8th). Therefore, in the midst of the hurricane warning, the threat of flooding can be avoided. However, there will still be autumn tides in the middle of this month. Yesterday, the tide still flooded the streets.</p>
<h3>US Attitude Very Firm on Maintaining Commercial Rights in Shanghai; Anglo-American Trade in North China Repeatedly Repelled; Commercial Competition Now Concentrated in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Da Zhong News Agency) Since Japan launched its military invasion of China, European and American trade in China has been gradually declining due to Japan's interference on the pretext of military needs. Before August 13th, the United States ranked first in China's national foreign import trade, followed by Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. However, since Japan implemented trade controls in North China, trade between third countries and China has decreased sharply, and the market in the occupied areas has been almost exclusively occupied by Japanese goods. According to customs statistics, the changes in the national trade between the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom in recent years are as follows (unit: gold unit):</p>
<p>US Goods Japanese Goods British Goods</p>
<p>Year 26 83,075,141 66,098,123 49,129,745</p>
<p>Year 27 660,008,175 90,481,011 30,836,905</p>
<p>January to August of Year 28 6,249,981 126,555,744 31,242,084</p>
<p>July of Year 29 94,093,000 105,582,000 16,640,000</p>
<p>(Import Comparison) Recently, Japanese imports have increased sharply, doubling compared to before the war. Although US goods have also increased slightly, this is purely due to the need for US cotton. China's domestic cotton is purchased and transported to Japan by the Japanese, and the country must purchase US cotton with foreign exchange. Since last year, there has also been the European war, so the United States has been able to maintain its trade with China without decline, while the United Kingdom and Germany are in dire straits. Even if the European war had not occurred, judging from the trend in 1938, it would inevitably decline. In North China, since the issuance of "United Reserve Certificates" and the implementation of import controls (foreign goods importers are initially limited to 80% of the foreign exchange collected from export goods), Japanese imports account for the absolute majority, while British and American goods lag far behind.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Customs Statistics) However, the legal tender is still circulating as usual in Shanghai, and the trade between the United Kingdom and the United States with China is concentrated in Shanghai. According to customs statistics, the recent trend of industrial competition among the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom in Shanghai is as follows (unit: gold unit):</p>
<p>US Goods Japanese Goods British Goods</p>
<p>Year 26 51,187,489 33,096,362 10,266,195</p>
<p>Year 27 26,523,222 16,154,159 12,962,090</p>
<p>January to April of Year 28 7,415,203 33,014,222 16,068,536</p>
<p>July of Year 29 62,132,569 16,32,429 8,159,353</p>
<p>Politics and economics are inherently inseparable. The result of the great powers' political concessions to Japan is the decline of their rights and interests in China. If the United Kingdom and the United States make further concessions in Shanghai, the collapse of their rights and interests in China will be obvious. The recent firm attitude of the United States towards Shanghai is a necessary step to protect its rights and interests in China.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Ships Sailing to Haiphong and Saigon; Schedule Unchanged; Shipping Industry Says Vietnamese Situation Has Not Changed</h3>
<p>The Vietnamese situation, which has been tense for some time, has eased after the Japanese side automatically withdrew the final ultimatum. The Shanghai-Vietnam route has been decided to resume, and details have been reported previously. Unexpectedly, it was reported that France allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, causing uneasiness in the market again yesterday. Some speculators took the opportunity to become active, and the market price of tapioca actually exceeded the price limit, and the actual price was not announced. Regarding the actual situation in Vietnam, the reporter specifically consulted the foreign shipping industry in this city.</p>
<p>(Schedule Unchanged) It is said that reports on the situation in Vietnam as published in the newspapers this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) have not been received from the ports in Vietnam, so the details are unknown. However, the Taikoo Kiangsu, which is scheduled to resume sailing, will set sail at 3:00 p.m. today, via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haikou, to Haiphong. The Kweiyang is also scheduled to depart at 3:00 p.m. today, via Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, to Siam, and also to Saigon. Although there are not many passengers and cargo being transported, it is determined to depart on schedule without changes.</p>
<p>(Vietnamese Situation Unchanged) Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng, which is scheduled to resume sailing to Haiphong on the 11th, has also begun selling tickets. Therefore, the Vietnamese situation can be guaranteed to be unchanged as of yesterday. This can be confirmed by the fact that the ships resuming the Shanghai-Vietnam route are not changing their schedules. In addition, Taikoo recently transferred the Ansheng, which previously sailed the Nanyang route, with a tonnage of 3,188 tons, to Shanghai to join the Shanghai-Singapore route. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and is temporarily docked at its own wharf in Pudong. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the first time to Singapore next Tuesday (the 10th), also serving Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Penang.</p>
<h3>Jiangding Still Not Released</h3>
<p>The Jiangding is still being detained and moored at Gaochang Temple. There has been no news of its release. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The rumor that it was released yesterday afternoon and sailed back to the No. 5 Wharf of the 16th Pier is not true. It has been learned that the ship is currently moored in the southern Huangpu River. As of yesterday afternoon, it has not turned around. The Ruitaide and Daping are also anchored in the area and are not moving. According to the Continental Report, a Japanese naval spokesman denied the reports yesterday afternoon (the 6th) that the German Jiangding was being detained by the Japanese authorities. It is claimed that the investigation has revealed that the Jiangding is not being detained by the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Regulates Automobile Industry; May Purchase When Necessary; Military Vehicles to Be Repaired First</h3>

<h3>Japan Denies Arresting Assassin in Attempted Assassination of Yao Ke; Municipal Council Currently Investigating; Remains Silent on Motives</h3>
<p>Yao Ke, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Public Concession Police Department, was attacked by two thugs the day before yesterday, but fortunately, they missed. One of the thugs was arrested on the spot by Japanese military police. Yesterday, the Japanese military police department was evasive about the whereabouts of the arrested thug, which was puzzling. According to Japanese newspapers in this city yesterday, both thugs who attempted to assassinate the police chief were at large and had not been apprehended. Yesterday, a Western reporter telephoned the Japanese military police headquarters on North Sichuan Road and was told that the arrested thug was still in custody and an investigation was underway. However, less than five minutes later, a spokesman for the Japanese military police department suddenly called back the Western reporter and said that although the case was under investigation, he could not say for sure whether a thug had been taken into custody. Furthermore, he could not confirm whether the thug was arrested by the Japanese military police. The Municipal Council Police Department also made no comment on the case, only saying that an investigation was underway and remained silent on the possible motives for the case.</p>
<h3>大同 Dyeing and Weaving Factory Embezzlement Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Older brother accuses younger brother of embezzling raw materials; refuses to hand over account books during audit.</p>
<p>The Datong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, located at 580 Beikaier Road, Hongkou, was founded by Kong Chunfang of Zhenjiang. It has been in operation for ten years and has developed successfully. However, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the factory's location was within the defense line, making it impossible to operate and temporarily suspending operations. In August of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the factory resumed operations. However, Kong Chunfang, due to old age and declining strength, entrusted his younger brother, Kong Yongqing, with the position of manager. Recently, Kong Chunfang, alleging that his brother had acquired many concubines and engaged in speculation, secretly transferred cotton yarn from the factory to his Yongfeng Yarn Store and embezzled raw materials worth 50,000 yuan, attempted to go to the factory to investigate the accounts. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, Kong Yongqing privately withheld 15 important account books from the factory and refused to meet him. Kong Chunfang then, on the 4th, accompanied by lawyer Jiang Pingfan, reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Li Yilian and Inspector Yuan Xinzhong, who arrested Kong Yongqing at 64, Lane 143, Kangti Road in the French Concession yesterday and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested a postponement. Under questioning, the plaintiff confessed that the factory was jointly established by his brothers, with him as the manager and his brother as the assistant. All the raw materials had been used up successively, and the surplus of over 100,000 yuan last year was also divided equally with his brother. This time, his brother suddenly took away four account books, and as he was the manager and responsible for everything, he removed the remaining account books. Judge Fu instructed the plaintiff to be detained pending a seven-day review and denied the request for bail.</p>
<h3>Coolidge Postpones Arrival in Shanghai, Empress of Russia Arrives Today</h3>
<p>The Changxing Company's Empress of Russia mail ship, which departed from Canada on the 27th of last month, stopping at Hong Kong and Luzon, is now returning from Luzon. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong at 5:30 PM today, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will transfer to a smaller vessel and land at the Customs Wharf around 7:00 PM this evening. The Empress of Russia will not stay long in Shanghai and is scheduled to depart at 12:30 AM tonight (i.e., morning of the 8th) for Japan, continuing to Xiangshan and returning to Vancouver. The small vessel for passenger transport will depart from the Customs Wharf at 11:30 PM tonight. The United States President Lines' President Coolidge mail ship, which has returned from Luzon to Shanghai to return to the United States, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 9th (tomorrow). However, according to the company's announcement, the mail ship was slightly delayed in loading cargo in the Philippine port, so the arrival in Shanghai has been changed to the 11th and is scheduled to depart on the 12th to return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai City Area Hit by Shells</h3>
<p>According to a telegram received yesterday from the shipping industry, a Japanese warship sailing from the north arrived outside Zhenhai Port on the morning of the 6th. Together with the previous ship, there were two ships. At 10:10 AM, they suddenly fired 11 shells at the Zhenhai city area. One shell landed in Qiujiang Alley, killing three people, injuring four, and destroying two houses. One shell landed in Pingjiang Alley, one shell landed at Lin Temple, one shell landed near Linchao, and many shells landed in the sea behind Lin Temple. At 11:00 AM, one ship sailed north. There is still one Japanese warship anchored outside Zhenhai Port.</p>
<h3>Patrol Officer on Avenue Dubail Robbed of Handgun</h3>
<p>Two bandits restrained throat, one bandit snatched handgun.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, a Chinese patrol officer No. 864 from the French Concession was dispatched to guard the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Lafu. Unexpectedly, three bandits in short clothes suddenly appeared. Two bandits stepped forward, and one bandit approached the patrol officer from behind, suddenly striking his throat, making him unable to speak. One bandit forcefully snatched the service handgun he was wearing and fled with another bandit who was acting as a lookout, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the patrol officer reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Selecting Domestic Helpers, Forcing Them into Massage Profession, Colluding with Employment Agencies to Lure Them into the Trap, Xu Alin Arrested by the Police</h3>
<p>Massage and guidance were originally good careers in the West for fitness and serving society, but once imitated in our country, they have become a kind of disguised prostitution that harms society. Some of the women in this profession are forced by hunger and cold and have no choice but to do this, while others are those who are in charge and use sweet words to deceive them from various rural areas to come to Shanghai. However, once they enter the cage, it is difficult to fly away. For many years, the number of decent women who have lost their chastity and reputation is unknown. If this organization continues, I don't know how many more women will fall into the fire pit. Xu Alin, a native of Yangzhou, opened the Penglai Women's Massage Parlor at 17, 992 Niuzhuang Road. The massage girls she hired were all lured by deception, and none of them were willing. The method of deception is based on the fact that various places are currently suffering from natural disasters and man-made disasters, and those who cannot live, come to Shanghai to make a living, especially women. The only way out for these women is to become domestic helpers, so the employment agencies are full of women waiting to be hired. Taking advantage of this time, they collude with the employment agencies to select women aged 16 to 22 and send them to their massage parlors, claiming they are domestic helpers. However, once the maids enter the massage parlor, they are forced to change their clothes and forced to work as massage girls. If they dare to resist, they will either have their clothes confiscated or be threatened with dangerous words. These women feel unfamiliar with the place and have no help, so they have to endure the pain and serve. The remuneration they receive is only 30 cents out of 2 yuan. Most of the Penglai massage girls are sent by Liu Tongxing Employment Agency on Route Père Robert in the French Concession. There was a woman named Xu Yaying who was just sent by Liu Tongxing a few days ago, and Xu Alin forced her to become a massage girl the day before yesterday. When Xu saw that the men who came were all naked and behaving in all kinds of obscene ways, she couldn't bear the shame and wanted to resign and leave, but she was monitored by the owner of the parlor. So yesterday, she took the opportunity to sneak out and reported to the Zhabei Police Station. Western Head Constable F. R. Howard No. 1013 went to arrest Xu Alin and seized 19 massage girls including Wang Yueying, Zhang Suzhen, Zhu Xiuying, Chen Yuemei, Wang Jinfeng, Yao Caiying, Chen Gendi, Wang Aizhen, Chen Jinying, Xu Laiying, Yao Fengying, Shen Baoying, Zhao Huizhen, Yu Guizhen, Xu Yueying, Zhang Yudi, Shi Meiying, Wang Xiuying, etc. After interrogation, it was learned that they were all deceived by Xu Alin using the above methods. Wang Xiuying (16 years old) was even sent by Xu to the Zhongshan Hotel one day to be raped by a guest, ruining her chastity. The head constable arrested Xu and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for the crime of inducing decent women to engage in indecent acts with others in accordance with Article 233 of the Criminal Law. After detailed interrogation by Judge Huang Risheng, he ordered Xu Alin to be detained pending a further review.</p>
<h3>Fire at a Tent Store on Tokyo Road, Apprentice Girl Burned to Death, Both Bodies Charred Beyond Recognition</h3>
<p>The Taichang Tent Store at 225 Tokyo Road in western Shanghai caught fire unexpectedly at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Instantly, flames soared and fire tongues spread in all directions. Once a tent is on fire, it is not easy to put out. When the fire was raging, apprentice Shi Wenbin (16 years old) and Chen Meiju, the six-year-old daughter of a tenant named Chen upstairs, were unable to escape and died in the fire. Later, firefighters dug out the bodies from the rubble. They were charred beyond recognition, making it unbearable to look at. The bodies were sent to the morgue for examination in a hearse. The fire brigade drove to the scene and extinguished the fire after about an hour. Several houses were burned down.</p>
<p>Machine Factory Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, a machine factory at 348 Avenue Metteunier in the French Concession suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. The fire immediately broke through the roof.

<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>On the road built beyond the Shanghai Western Boundary, outside the Meilifang Gate on Daxilu Road, at approximately 6:35 PM yesterday, a Route 2 public bus sped by. Unexpectedly, four bandits emerged from the roadside. Three of them were armed and forced their way onto the bus. They pulled out their handguns, and all 30 or so passengers on board were robbed, with no one spared. The losses are said to be substantial, but the exact amount is unknown. Afterwards, the driver, ticket seller, and others reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and requested an investigation.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Stirred Up a Huge Wave</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market for British and American currency experienced another huge wave, first rising sharply and then suddenly falling back slightly. Initially, it was reported that France had allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to invade China, causing fear. Chinese merchants and speculators came to dump their holdings, and importers settled 300,000 US dollars. It was rumored that a Japanese bank also settled 400,000 US dollars, but this was difficult to confirm. Therefore, a certain American bank alone supplied more than 200,000 US dollars, and other banks also raised prices to squeeze out supply. For a time, the tightness was very strong. US dollars were still being absorbed by banks at 5.25 yuan, and British pounds also tightened to 3 pence and 4375. Then, news came that the United States and the Soviet Union had reached a certain agreement, and the panic subsided immediately. Chinese banks were willing to supply, and speculators turned to cover their positions. The US dollar immediately returned to a flat rate of 5.34375 yuan, and the British pound also recovered slightly. Finally, it was heard that a certain Chinese bank was absorbing supply, and the market softened again at noon. The closing price was 3 pence and 453125 for British pounds and 5.28125 yuan for US dollars, with British tightening by 0.046875 and US tightening by 0.0625.

US dollars were up 3 points against British pounds and there was no market against French francs. The central listed prices for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning: British pounds at 3 pence and 484375 and US dollars at 5.3125 yuan, which was British tightened by 0.015625 and US softened by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing. The market was stable after the opening. Foreign firms first traded US dollars for September delivery at 5.34375 yuan, approximately 120,000 yuan. Later, foreign firms suddenly had a large number of settlements, causing the market to tighten. Initially, they sought US dollars for October delivery at 5.3125 yuan from American banks, but the price had softened to 5.25 yuan by the time they entered the foreign firms. HSBC's listed prices were announced in the morning and remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver equalization tax also showed no increase or decrease. After this, speculators also came to buy US dollars for September delivery at 5.21875 yuan, and US dollars for October delivery even fell to 5.1875 yuan. At this time, the American banks' appetite was also strong. It is estimated that foreign firms traded US dollars for September delivery at 5.25 yuan. Later, due to rumors of bearish news, Chinese merchants and speculators came to dump their holdings, and the potential gradually loosened. It is estimated that Chinese merchants sold US dollars for October delivery to foreign firms at 5.28125 yuan, and sold US dollars for September delivery to Chinese banks at 5.3125 yuan to 5.34375 yuan. By noon, foreign firms were selling US dollars for the current month to Chinese banks at 5.3125 yuan.

<h3>Gold Price Rose Sharply, Then Retraced Slightly, Fluctuating Hundreds of Yuan in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for spot gold in Shanghai rose and fell with the rumors from foreign telegrams, causing confusion. The price repeatedly broke through the 6,200 yuan barrier but then fell back. Initially, it was seen that France, which had been brewing for a long time, had allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to invade China. Foreign exchange was already tightening sharply due to the panic buying by speculators, importers, and Japanese banks. People were panicking, and buying sentiment spread. Sellers took the opportunity to hoard. The price opened at a high of 6,280 yuan in the morning in the midst of chaos. After the opening, securities firms and gold shops began to sell, and the buying trend gradually subsided. Suddenly, news came that the United States and the Soviet Union had reached a certain agreement, and foreign exchange began to harden, causing the price to rebound sharply and fall wildly. New bulls rushed to close their positions, and the price immediately fell sharply to 6,170 yuan. Later, following the US dollar market, it eventually rose to 6,195 yuan, a rebound of 30 yuan. There was an example break in the afternoon on Saturday. It was heard that the outside market price had returned slightly lower. More than 4,000 taels were traded in half a day. The price of gold jewelry rose by 10 yuan, to 640 yuan. Customs gold and other items were flat.</p>
<p>Spot Rose by 30 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, the market was very firm due to the tightening of the exchange market. Most people were willing to buy at 5 yuan higher than the listed price (i.e., the opening price). Many transactions took place at that time. Initially, gold shops took in 20 taels from silver shops for 6,280 yuan, an increase of 115 yuan compared to the previous day. Unexpectedly, the market situation suddenly changed after the opening, because the foreign exchange market had reported a loosening at that time, which immediately caused a selling trend. Certain securities firms, gold shops, and retail investors rushed to sell. Around 10:00 AM, the price fell to 6,170 yuan. Later, as the exchange market softened again, the selling trend gradually subsided. Silver shops and money changers took advantage of the low price to strongly raise the price again to 6,230 yuan. Finally, due to the fact that most people were bearish and frequently sold at high prices, silver shops and securities firms made great efforts to supply. Before closing, the price retreated again to 6,190 yuan. The result was a closing price of 6,195 yuan, which was still 30 yuan higher than the previous day. There were still transactions below the closing price after the close, showing a fatigue. There were fluctuations of hundreds and tens of yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash gold at gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current marked gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed 10 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was initially listed at 630 yuan by Dahang Tong. At 9:30 AM, it was listed 10 yuan higher. There were no changes after this. Dahang Tong changed its listing to 640 yuan. The new shops had similar prices to the previous price, with a buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market initially rose sharply due to the report that France had allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, resulting in high demand for British and American gold pounds. However, it soon fell back, and each eventually rose by one yuan. The British gold note initially rose to 18 yuan and 94 cents, but then suddenly declined, eventually closing at 18 yuan and 72 cents, an increase of 5 cents compared to the previous day. The Singapore note rose by 10 cents, and the falling trend of the Japanese gold note gradually subsided, with the evening market reaching 1 yuan and 43 cents. The supply and demand of the Korean note was even, and the market price stabilized, with the evening market still at 1 yuan and 16 cents.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Became a Black Market, Prices Invariably Rose, Speculators Boldly, Money Industry Supporting Them</h3>
<p>Due to rice merchants' fear of public opinion and political attacks from all sides, the market for foreign rice deemed buying and selling Du rice on the black market outside of the market to be safer, and is a model for all to follow. The market no longer sees formal transactions for foreign rice. If there are transactions, they are nothing more than lower quality goods, and I will replace them with rush goods. Formal transactions in the market are less than a thousand bags. The black market for foreign rice is also as endless as the black market for japonica rice. There is talk of 64 or 5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon Siam fire mixed. There are sayings of 61 or 2 yuan for No. 2 and small mixed, and because the evaluation of the original packed English Chinese company No. 2 Siam and No. 2 Saigon is only 71 and a half yuan, and the black market had already exceeded it, yesterday there was talk of 73, 4, and 5 yuan. The asking price for the spot and original packaged black markets are generally one yuan higher than the previous day. Currently, the rice market has long been monopolized and speculated on by large households. Rumors abound in the market, and new tricks are constantly being invented. No wonder the general public is blindly deceived. Therefore, formal sales were still cautious yesterday, while floating hoarders and retailers were still active. The total number of transactions, including original packages, was still 6 or 7 thousand bags. Because the money industry supports them, they can mortgage and lend, so the hoarders are bolder. It is rumored that No. 1 Saigon has reached 65 yuan again, fire mixed 64 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 62 and a half yuan, No. 2 Siam and small mixed 61 yuan, rice tea 51 yuan, which is an increase of 2 yuan over the previous evaluation. Only Tokyo second-class cypress tip and red rice are still on the right track, opening at 56 yuan.</p>
<p>Slightly more japonica and glutinous rice arrived yesterday, totaling 1,300 to 400 bags. Rumors said that the market sentiment in the open and black markets was more stable, because the prices had already been raised so high, and the general cargo owners also knew that it was not easy to raise them further. They no longer insisted and were willing to open at the previous prices, so the selling prices were still neither up nor down. Changbang Qing japonica was 77 or 8 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica was 75 or 6 yuan, next to Su 72 or 3 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice 72 or 3 yuan, Nangang original packaged early rice 71 or 2 yuan, Hulu Jian was from 69 and a half yuan to 68 and a half yuan, Jinli special yuan 70 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan 68 or 9 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous special from 70 yuan, medium to 64 or 5 yuan. As for the new japonica and new sheep tips, the arrivals were also not weak, estimated to be 40 loads of Zhoupu japonica, 16 loads of Zhuanqiao japonica, and 22 loads of Taicang sheep tips, totaling no less than nearly 100 loads, so although the sales were lively like foreign rice, the market was difficult to increase and presented a fixed situation. Zhoupu japonica was sold at 69 yuan, Zhuanqiao japonica at 69 and a half yuan, Taicang sheep tips at 63 or 4 yuan for the original package, and Hulu Jian at 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Firm</h3>
<p>Flour: The market was consistently firm yesterday. Since the original factory's flour supply has been reduced, the demand on this street has long exceeded the supply. Moreover, the goods returned to the market are also felt to be scarce, so Fuxin and old brands are not available for purchase in whole amounts. Although the factory price is still 15 yuan, the retail market price varies greatly. Recently, the Phoenix brand of Japanese factory flour has been taken up by customers, and has become a business item for speculators. Yesterday, due to the rise in rice prices, new hoarders absorbed heavily, and the price rose by 5 cents to 1 dime. It is estimated that the opening spot Phoenix was 14 yuan and 7 dimes, September 14 yuan and 9 dimes and a half, and October 15 yuan and 3 dimes and a half, with 4,500 bags traded. Also, 1,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen today.</p>
<p>Wheat: Transactions were still quiet yesterday, because the supply from the interior was limited, and it was even more difficult to import into the concessions. Although the appetite of Chinese factories and export firms was good, there was no large amount to be collected. Moreover, the transactions of brokers are like smuggling goods and are not formally public. Yesterday, it was heard that Kuntai wheat was still 25 yuan and 35 cents, with one or two hundred bags taken for export. The Japanese factory's import price was still only 21 or 2 yuan, with about two or three thousand bags collected. Also, 980 bags of wheat will be shipped to Xiamen today.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Inventory of Yarn Increases Daily, Knowing That Hoarding Yarn is Not a Solution, Thinking About Disease From Foreign Exchange Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still not far from the hovering zone. Although Hong Kong firms have not made large-scale purchases, the demand for designated yarn has improved somewhat, so some people are looking high and delaying imports. In general, cautious people, in view of the gradual increase in yarn inventory, such a situation, accumulated over time, hoarding is not a fundamental solution, so the public psychology is still inclined to think about foreign exchange. Therefore, those holding goods are as quiet as usual.</p>
<p>The market situation for spot yarn opened flat in the morning, with 20-count Double Horse priced at 1,015 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. Later, it was heard that the exchange rate had shrunk and then risen again. At the same time, the news that the border crossing allowed Japan to pass suddenly caused a false wind, falling to 1,012 yuan, but Tianjin firms suddenly came to collect two or three hundred bags, and the situation rebounded to 1,019 yuan. However, Kangji Bank still sold out. The closing price was 1,018 and a half yuan. The transaction statistics for half a day were 2,620 bags. The market for 20-count Double Horse rose by 3 and a half yuan. Today, 75 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Xiamen, 1,415 pieces to Hong Kong, 45 pieces to Haikou, and 265 pieces to Siam. The amount of purchases by various firms is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Peers 1,730 Hong Kong 875</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Fuzhou 9 Total 2,620</p>
<h3>Long-Fiber Cotton Nearly Searched Out</h3>
<p>Current cotton trading is still good, but sparser than yesterday. Factories only showed some interest in purchasing new cotton, while otherwise remaining quiet and inactive.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 260.00 Shenxin purchased 35 bales</p>
<p>Dazhongji 202.00 Shenxin purchased 85 bales</p>
<p>Dazhongji 32.00 Shenxin purchased 97 bales</p>
<p>Mitterling 263.00 Yuancheng purchased 100 bales</p>
<p>Brazil 258.40 Yuancheng purchased 167 bales</p>
<p>Pingguoer 139.50 Shenghe purchased 100 bales</p>
<p>Pingguoer 140.00 Yongda purchased 100 bales</p>
<p>Another report: Overseas cotton prices. The New York cotton market was slightly weaker yesterday, with public selling and some long positions being closed out. As a result, the closing price fell by five to six pounds compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, with predictions of another rupee increase.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been particularly active recently, especially for long-fiber cotton. This is because this type of raw cotton is very scarce in the market, and overseas shipping is inconvenient with extraordinarily high war risk insurance rates. Foreign firms require payment before shipment, which is quite inconvenient. Factories have a strong need, so they have been aggressively searching the market in recent days, and the long-fiber cotton in the market has almost been completely searched out. Therefore, the price of cotton has been rising sharply in recent days.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Buyers Have Strong Stockpiling Intentions, Market Temporarily Stabilized</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday the market was peaceful, and sales prices showed little change, varying by only one or two jiao per bolt. In reality, Shanghai's export sales are obstructed, with supply exceeding demand. However, due to the lack of a consistent source from the inland, various goods are very popular. Therefore, buyers from Shanghai merchants are very interested in purchasing goods in Shanghai and are continuously stockpiling large quantities, which has stabilized the market. Yesterday, this street's transactions totaled over 500 pieces, with Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchasing over 200 pieces of dyed cloth and twill, Northern traders from Yantai and Tianjin purchasing over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel, and merchants from Southeast Asia purchasing over 8,000 pieces of dyed cloth, twill, and bleached cloth. Recently, the autumn bargain sales situation in the shops on this street is slightly worse than last year. The largest stores have daily sales amounts of about 40,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Trading is not high, but the market sentiment is very firm. White cloth, the leader, is hovering around 32.9 yuan, an increase of 2.5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day's market price. Four Gentlemen Serge is still priced at 9 jiao 3 fen 2.5 li due to the current cheap sale price by the firms, but most people expect the price to rise.</p>
<p>Exports: There were 1,155 pieces of piece goods exported to Hong Kong today, 265 pieces to Xiamen, 2 pieces to Haikou, and 215 pieces to Siam.</p>
<h3>Grains: Soybean Trading Starts, Oil Bean Imports and Exports Are Very Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market situation remained good, but its potential was not showing a violently rising trend. Due to the disappearance of speculators and the actual sales market not being overwhelmed, the scope of fluctuations was not broad, causing the overall situation to remain in a hovering pattern. Since the continuous rise in recent days, trading has also begun. Yesterday, the activity continued, and market prices were seen to rise even further. It is estimated that over 1,000 bags of Qingdao beans were handled by Nanyang Port merchants on this street, with prices rising from 34.5 yuan to 37.5 yuan. Over 500 bags of Sangyuan beans were priced at 34.3 yuan to 34.85 yuan. Over 200 bags of Anqing beans were priced at 34 yuan. 300 bags of Wuhu beans were priced at 32.4 yuan. 200 bags of Nanjing beans were priced at 33 yuan. 97 bags of Taicang new soybeans were priced at 36 yuan. Hundreds of bags of Pudong soybeans and Chongming soybeans, and 150 bags of Chongming yellow sand beans, and 200 bags of Dalian mixed green beans.</p>
<p>Also, there were 1,195 bags of beans and 1,000 bean cakes, and 975 cans of raw oil shipped to Xiamen today. In addition, 520 bags of raw peanuts, 1,570 cans of raw oil, 370 bags of beans, and 1,240 bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong. Also, 685 bags of sesame were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>In addition, 3,070 cans of raw oil arrived from Qingdao yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar is Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat and weak. The association's listed prices are: spot No. 24 coarse white, new goods in this warehouse, 78.2 yuan; goods arriving in May, 77.5 yuan; goods arriving in April, 76.8 yuan; re-exported goods, 62.5 yuan; Dutch red sugar, spot, 63.8 yuan; goods on the way, 63 yuan. Taikoo granulated white B mark is still 77 yuan, the lower grades are slightly lower, DY mark 73 yuan, HX mark 72.7 yuan to 72.5 yuan. Domestic sugar only had asking prices, no transactions. Also, 1,160 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Native Nails and Wire Rods Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market prices of native factory wire nails and wire rods both showed increases. The reasons are now described in two points as follows:</p>
<p>Native Nails: Native factory wire nails, after the drastic changes in the exchange rate on May 2nd, the asking price soared to a peak of 85 yuan. The high spirits of the industry can be seen. They purchased raw materials (wire rods) for nail making from overseas. Afterwards, due to the obstruction of the northern supply channels and the blockade of domestic sales, coupled with the deteriorating situation in Southeast Asia, overseas transactions were insignificant. Moreover, the sales market for construction businesses on this street was small, leading to a slump in the native nail market. In addition, overseas orders arrived from time to time, resulting in an oversupply, and the market price plummeted, even falling to 40 yuan. Many people suffered losses. However, recently, the Yantai merchants have risen to handle the business, and the construction businesses in this city have also gradually become active. Therefore, the market has recovered, and the asking price yesterday was 50 yuan per barrel, an increase of 4 to 5 yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Wire Rods: The raw material for manufacturing native nails, also known as wire, its market trend mostly rises and falls with native nails. The previous and yesterday's native nail market prices were firm, and there were many inquiries for goods, and the standards also continued to increase. The selling price per dan was also around 50 yuan, and there were many purchases, mostly by the nail factories on this street.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Mussels Are Scarce and Prices Rise Frequently</h3>
<p>Dried mussels have recently been in short supply due to intermittent sources, and market prices have been rising accordingly. Currently, medium-sized Western mussels have risen from 170 yuan to 190 yuan. Other domestic products, such as Ningbo dried mussels, have sold for 310 yuan, and the momentum is particularly strong.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds are Extremely Strong and Unstoppable, Rising for Eleven Consecutive Days... Up Over Four Yuan</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for securities, yesterday's market conditions, actually saw another round of increases. Most people predicted that Class C would be 55 yuan, yesterday the market was only one jiao short, unfortunately it was unable to break through. According to the bond market's rising trend, from August 26th to yesterday, it has risen for eleven days. Although there have been one or two minor corrections in between, the closing price on that day has always been higher than the price of the next day. The extension of the rising trend for so long was truly unexpected. Although credit is loose, there has been no increase in demand for remittances, which can be seen from the daily decline in the discount market price. The talk of new loans has been going on for a long time, not only has it not materialized, but repeated denials from all parties have made people even more uneasy. Vietnam's allowance of passage, the invasion of Yunnan is inevitable. The difficulty in easing the tightness of the paper currency market is sufficient to prove that the situation is still very chaotic. Yesterday's market price for Class C initially approached the 4 yuan mark. The bulls, fearing its decline, had no choice but to struggle again. Therefore, in the afternoon, one side bravely pulled up the price, while the other side was already looking for ways to escape, but the methods are not something outsiders can see. In short, the market price has risen by more than four yuan. The short covering was at its peak yesterday, which made the surface more crowded. A turnaround is inevitable. Kang, Jiufeng, and Hongda have been buying in for many days, and yesterday they felt satisfied. Yitai, on behalf of a trust company, has bought in a very considerable amount. The shorts, unable to withstand the pressure, also covered a large amount. Lianyi and Hengfu took advantage of the high prices to leave the market. Most retail investors covered their positions. The bull's wall is being built higher and higher. When the moon is full, it wanes, this is an unchanging principle. Yesterday's results, continued to rise by another three to seven jiao, all seeing new high prices again. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.6 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 200 shares of Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company were traded at a price of 3.5 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stocks only saw bank stocks continue to improve. Jardine Matheson Bank continued to rise by one shilling and two pence, priced at six pounds eight shillings and nine pence. All others remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Today's Day of Prayer</h3>
<p>Both the President of the United States, Roosevelt, and the British Monarch, George VI, have designated today, September 8th, as a national day of prayer. Churches throughout the United States, Britain, and Shanghai are preparing to hold special services today, so that Christians everywhere can repent and reflect, pray for divine guidance, and promote the innate conscience to explore the path to luminous truth. The intention is supremely good.</p>
<p>On the surface, this may seem like just another religious ceremony, not worth noting. Especially in a religiously conservative nation like Britain, a national day of prayer is not uncommon. However, from another perspective, Britain is currently in a historically unprecedented and critical period. Every action, whether military, political, domestic, or diplomatic, is of utmost importance. How could those in power act carelessly? The ancients said, "If you offend Heaven, even prayer is futile." Britain's traditionally imperialistic policies, which only care about their own interests regardless of the life or death of others, were bound to face a day of "retribution." To put it bluntly, what they are experiencing now is just the beginning of reaping what they sowed. The suffering they will endure in the future may be a hundred or a thousand times greater.</p>
<p>What is the true meaning of prayer? First, it must be understood that prayer is an active action, the true expression of the Christian spirit. Second, prayer is the source of spiritual unity, an essential element for achieving victory. When an individual is at the brink of life and death, or a nation faces a critical moment of survival, and all possible human methods have been exhausted, the last hope lies in praying to Heaven. However, such prayer is merely temporary and responsive, not grasping the true essence of prayer. If an individual, or even an entire society or nation, seeks success in life, they should incorporate the spirit of prayer into their daily lives, integrating life with prayer, and building all hopes and beliefs upon prayer.</p>
<p>An American businessman said that a successful life should begin with living prayer. He believes that prayer should not be like an old monk chanting scriptures, "saying the words without the heart," nor should it be a "begging" posture. Because most people—those who consider themselves devout Christians—often open their eyes in the morning and say, "Lord, give me this... Lord, give me that," and after a while, they say again, "God, please save me from doing this... Please bless me so that I can do that... Please grant me great grace..." While asking for this and that, they neglect the prayer in the Lord's Prayer, the mere words "Thy will be done."</p>
<p>Let's examine the words "Thy will be done." Does "Thy" refer to the one who prays or the one who is prayed to? If it refers to the one who prays, then the person reciting the prayer need not ask for anything and can simply do as they please. Instead, one should abandon the self, eliminate ego, eradicate selfish and self-serving notions, and express sincere obedience to the divine. Only then is prayer reasonable, only then is it a way to extend oneself to others. Many truly capable people are defeated. Why? Because they overly value their own self-interest and have not embarked on the path of reasonable prayer, encountering only a "second-rate" life. Beyond their own small selves, they have never experienced the vast garden of obedient living. Their prayers are merely requests.</p>
<p>The so-called "Thy will be done" should not be passively waiting for God to "bestow" all blessings. One should always transform passive "waiting for fulfillment" into active "doing." The famous social reformer Theodore Parker put it well: "The man who prays well does not call God to do the work of man, but first prays for repentance, prays for detachment, and then prays for action—imploring with heart, head, and hand together." Therefore, the one who prays reasonably well, when praying, acts as if everything depends on God; and when working, acts as if everything depends on themselves. Thus, what is sought is in Heaven, but what is done is still up to oneself!</p>
<p>In this season of bloody war in Europe, the philosophy of dictators running counter to the Way is nothing more than taking "My will be done" as the center. However, it must be said that such dictatorial behavior can be found everywhere in the world, not just in Europe. These people specialize in doing things that "harm others without benefiting themselves." If they were willing to replace "My" with "Thy," wouldn't that be wonderful?</p>
<p>The famous British writer Stephen Foot, in his article "We Must Arouse the Power of Britain," said that the source of strength for a person who is fearless in the face of danger, willing to discard their own selfishness, and willing to complete the sacrifice, comes from only one place. He knew that during the last war, two senior British officers risked great danger and received medals. One was a brigadier who was unusually respectful of the divine, always with the Bible by his side, and kneeling when praying. The other was an air force officer who once heard many comrades discussing the issue of divinity and showing some disdain for religion. This officer initially listened silently, but later stood in front of the fireplace and said, "Friends, I have heard all your words. What I want to say is that I am older than you. I consider the few achievements in my life that I can boast about to have been accomplished through the spirit of Christ."</p>
<p>Stephen Foot also said that in times of national crisis, the responsibility of Christians lies in arousing the hearts of the nation. We must possess the spirit of resolve, calmness, unity, and inspiration. Resolve should be guided by God's plan, with the determination to eliminate evil and pursue purity. Calmness comes from the love of Christ, where nothing disturbs the heart. Inspiration is the inevitable result of listening to God's will. The miracle of the French maiden Joan of Arc came from this.</p>
<p>The first British admiral, Nelson, was a firm believer in prayer. In the moments before the Battle of Trafalgar, he knelt at his desk in the flagship cabin and wrote his "prayer for victory" in his diary: "May my beloved God, for the benefit of all of Europe, grant our country a great and glorious victory; so that everyone will deeply restrain themselves, with no harm to the nation; and after victory, may benevolence and righteousness always abide in the British Navy. I personally entrust my life to the Creator, may His glory bless my passion, so that I may faithfully serve my country. I commit myself to the presence of God, so that I may defend the nation with justice. Amen."</p>
<p>In short, prayer is the essence of goodness, purity, and upright thought. When praying, one should carefully consider what is being said, striving to make thoughts substantial and real. Only then will what is prayed for have power, and this power will be a part of our body, mind, and spirit.</p>

<h3>Rise and Fall of American Movies and Music (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>Alright! Now that Class C theaters are showing two full-length films per screening, the increased ticket revenue is more than enough to pay for the low rental price of another film. The owner of the Class D theater on the corner, seeing that his business was about to become slow, also quickly followed suit by showing two full-length films per screening. In this way, they learned from each other, step by step, pushing it upwards, even reaching the "first-run" Class A theaters. To compete with the "second-run" Class B theaters, they had no choice but to show two full-length films per screening. The theaters that specialized in Paramount films were doing this, and the theaters of the Fox Company were also doing this. Thus, like a contagious disease, the whole country became ill.</p>
<p>What is particularly sad is that the so-called two-film screenings are not just showing a new film paired with an old film. Now, it has become even worse, with two brand-new films being shown consecutively in the same screening! There is even a theater in Chicago that shows two full-length films, including previews and short miscellaneous films, for a total of six hours, but charges only the price of one screening! And a movie theater in Kansas offers patrons not only three full-length films for a dime but also a free full-course meal! As for the gifts offered by various theaters, there is an even wider variety: tea cloths, kitchen knives, tea, encyclopedias, imitation jewelry, pastries, ice cream, lecture folders, dictionaries, coffee, candies, razor blades, silverware, silk stockings, and the Harvard Classics. If you want to furnish your home, you can simply go to the movie theater!</p>
<p>Going to the movies was originally a leisurely entertainment, but under the current prevalence of the two-film system, everyone is beginning to dread it. What parent would want their children to sit in the dark for up to six hours? Not only is sitting still tiring, but it also damages eyesight, making it a losing proposition. Therefore, parents everywhere have written many letters asking for the movie screening time to be shortened.</p>
<p>In addition to customers' reluctance to go to the movies, Hollywood itself is also in a precarious situation, like a prisoner awaiting their final fate. Besides the lack of customers, other reasons are also quite important. One is the increase in film production costs, especially the salaries of stars, while at the same time, profits are decreasing. Secondly, sales are sluggish due to the impact of the war. Forty percent of the revenue from the American film industry comes from overseas. Because of the European war, that revenue has decreased by seven percent, three percent of which comes from Brussels, The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp. In addition, investment in films has also been reduced due to the war. However, the war has also helped the film industry in one or two ways. Because most of the films are now sold domestically, there is less concern or interference from foreign countries. In the past, there were often several films with good themes and plots, but they were abandoned due to government warnings.</p>
<p>Radio has now become a powerful rival to movies. "Fortune" magazine recently conducted a survey among the public regarding the choice between the two. The result was that as many as 79% of respondents would rather give up movies and replace them with radio. This is truly a bolt from the blue! Radio has three advantages over movies: (1) Radio is free. Except for the initial purchase of the radio and a small maintenance fee, there are no other expenses. (2) Convenience. People who listen to the radio do not have to travel into the city or twist and turn. They can enjoy it simply by sitting at home. (3) Selectivity. You can listen to whatever program you like with just a wave of your hand. On the other hand, if you don't like the movie that is being shown in the theater, nine out of ten people will just have to sit there and try to recoup their "investment," but you have already developed a negative reaction to any film. This is like sealing a letter and putting on a stamp. If you want to reread what is written on that letter, few people, except for those with a very strong will, are willing to sacrifice the stamp.</p>
<p>The progress of television poses an even greater threat to movies. The general public likes to go to the theater because humans are social beings, but this is only one aspect. Movie makers only need to work hard on "authenticity." If this can be achieved, it can far surpass radio.</p>
<p>The originator of the two-film screenings was a movie theater in Harvard, Massachusetts, as early as 1916. As for the motivation and how it happened, there is no way to know. The initial reason was probably that a neighboring theater had the same program but charged a slightly lower price. This theater was unwilling to lower its price, so it charged customers the price of one screening but showed them two films. The neighboring theater, of course, knew about this clever trick, so they imitated each other, creating the trend of two-film screenings.</p>
<p>In this time of instability for the film industry, fortunately, American music has recently gained widespread attention. Originally, because of the great development of radio broadcasting, the United States can be said to be the country with the most listeners in the world. However, from the perspective of classicism or conservatism, American culture always has a "metallic taste," and music is no exception. To put it bluntly, America has long been seen as a "country that does not understand music." But now everything has changed, and the previous judgments can no longer stand. Dr. Hanson, director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, strongly refuted this view. His main idea is: America's contribution to music education in the world that is most worthy of attention is the promotion of symphony orchestras in secondary schools. This is the newest and relatively unnoticed thing. The beginning of this new era in music began twelve years ago, when students with musical talent were selected from many secondary schools and organized into a 300-member symphony orchestra. Initially, it was guided by Dr. Hanson. The scope of music was originally relatively narrow and had an air of dignity. For hundreds of years, its foundation was almost entirely built on a small number of special classes of people. But now, this closed atmosphere has been opened up, fully embodying the spirit of populism, and American boys and girls can all be bathed in the blessings of music education. In recent years, many major symphonies have been conducted by American musicians from American public schools. And many famous foreign music conductors have praised the greatest musical works in the world today as coming from the hands of American composers. This is clear evidence that American music has been valued by the world. Dr. Hanson also said that no matter what the facts are, no matter how long the time has passed, the aspirations and insights of the great artists and the experience we have gained are all in agreement and will always be in harmony. Due to this kind of spiritual effect, harmony, empathy, and tacit understanding among human beings can mutually grow with beautiful things, and the populist spirit of America should be guided by this. Also, Mr. Gilskin, deputy director of the Adult Education Group of the Chicago Works Project Administration, advocated that everyone use their spare time to develop their cultural activities. Paying attention to the cultivation of the temperament of men and women and the inculcation of aesthetic education, advocating music education is of course also part of what he advocates.</p>

<h3>Antithetical Couplet for Donation Bureau</h3>
<p>The patrol officers and detectives hired many assistants to search for illegal activities, while they themselves freely spent money in opium dens and restaurants. This is what all the donation bureaus are like. Yesterday, it was said that someone gave them a couplet: "We merchants run small businesses, we must impartially contribute daily according to regulations, only Heaven can witness. May your esteemed bureau wield great power, do not let your subordinates chase shadows, and divide the spoils while sitting." Because it is in the tone of a businessman, the phrasing is not well-crafted, but the sentiment can be seen.</p>
<h3>Butcher Mei's Realization</h3>
<p>A certain person in the eastern part of Yangzhou City made a living as a butcher. At the crack of dawn, the sound of knives could be heard. He would skin and scrape the animals, and then use a pot of hot water to clean and polish them. However, recently, this person suddenly contracted an illness. His whole body itched terribly. He consulted doctors, but they could not determine the cause of his illness. When the itching became unbearable, he had to bathe in boiling water to find relief. Later, he realized, "I treated animals this way, and now Heaven is treating me this way. It is only right." So he abandoned his butchering business, and his illness was cured.</p>
<h3>Elegant Jest About an Illness</h3>
<p>A certain licentiate from Zhangmen recently had a grandson. He widely distributed ginger soup. When seeing off guests at the bottom of the stairs, he broke his foot. He urgently summoned a surgeon, who splinted it with boards and bound it with rope. The next morning, a guest went to visit him. Seeing his condition, he smiled and said to the old man, "Your grandson can truly be said to 'rope his ancestors' footsteps'!" Everyone who heard this burst into laughter!</p>

<h3>Chatting About Vietnam</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>These past few days, the Vietnam issue has filled the pages of every newspaper, causing the people of our country to immediately pay attention to Vietnam. Vietnam was originally a vassal state of our country but later became a French colony. Therefore, I will briefly introduce Vietnam's location, transportation, agriculture, and customs, so that children can have a deep impression of it!</p>
<p>Politically, Vietnam is divided into five parts: Tonkin (also known as Bắc Kỳ), Annam (also known as Trung Kỳ), Cochinchina (also known as Nam Kỳ), Cambodia (also known as Cao Miên), and Laos (also known as Lạng Xang). France has placed a governor-general in Hanoi, Tonkin, and a deputy governor-general in Saigon, Cochinchina, to govern the military and civilian affairs of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Location: Vietnam is located in the southeast of Asia, in the eastern part of the Indochina Peninsula. It is bordered by the three provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong in our country to the north, Myanmar and Thailand (Siam) to the west, the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. Its area is about four times the size of Fujian Province in our country.</p>
<p>Transportation: Vietnam's land transportation is mainly railways, with about 1,400 miles of railways completed. The coastal trunk line from Hanoi to Saigon has been connected. Railways have also been built from Haiphong to Kunming and from Hanoi to Zhennanguan in Guangxi. People from the southeastern provinces of our country often take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to go to Yunnan. As for waterways, there is the Red River (the upper reaches of which are the Fulang River in our country), and its port, Haiphong, is a must-pass for ships, exporting rice, silk, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, from which it goes to the sea.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products: Vietnam's agriculture is the most prosperous, and its rice production is famous throughout the world. The Saigon rice we eat now comes from Vietnam. In addition to rice, there are also many other agricultural products, such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, soybeans, peanuts, corn, pepper, tea, rubber, coconuts, and sugar cane.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese people resemble our people in appearance, but they are short and have slightly darker skin. Their language is very similar to our language. The clothing is the same for men and women. When going out, they all wear a large bamboo and palm-leaf hat, but they are lazy and do not know how to make progress.</p>
<h3>A Genuine Children's Picture Magazine</h3>
<p>— Yi Ying</p>
<p>The children's picture magazine I want to introduce here is not published by any publishing house, but is run solely by a child. He does everything himself: editing, writing, and publishing. It can truly be called a genuine children's picture magazine.</p>
<p>One day, I went to visit a friend named Shen. As soon as I sat down, I noticed a colored drawing on the wall. It depicted an open book, with pictures on the top half and words on the bottom half. The picture showed many airplanes engaged in battle. Some were falling straight down from the clouds, with black smoke trailing from their tails. The markings of small red circles could be vaguely seen on the fuselages. The words on the bottom half read:</p>
<p>Little Painter Brother's Edited and Drawn Little Picture Magazine</p>
<p>—Special Issue on Air Combat—Subscribe Now!</p>
<p>Subscription fee: one small apple or two small bananas per issue.</p>
<p>Note: Inferior goods will not be accepted, rotten goods will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Ah! It turned out to be a small advertisement. I couldn't help but ask Mr. Shen, "What is this thing?"</p>
<p>Mr. Shen smiled and said, "This is my eldest son Huimin's creation. Huimin likes to draw and is always scribbling. Once, he had a sudden inspiration to run a picture magazine by himself. He made up his mind, drew pictures, and wrote explanations, but he didn't allow anyone else to take a peek. He was busy for four or five days, almost forgetting to eat and sleep. Sure enough, he bound a small picture book and named it Little Picture Magazine. At first, his only subscribers were his younger brother and sister, but later it expanded to</p>
<p>the children in the house and the children in the neighborhood. He can actually receive ten or so apples or bananas each time.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen casually took out a few previous issues of the picture magazine from the small bookcase and handed them to me to look at. I flipped through them from beginning to end and found them very interesting. I couldn't help but say, "No wonder the children are willing to send him apples and bananas to eat."</p>
<p>Here is a page from the Little Picture Magazine:</p>
<p>Children, after reading the above introduction, please don't suspect that I am the salesman of the little painter Huimin, wanting to attract more subscribers for him so that he can eat one or two more apples. (His picture magazine only publishes one copy per issue, and it's not even enough to supply the existing subscribers.) I just think this is a good idea and worth introducing to the children in Shanghai to do the same: either work alone, or cooperate with a few people, or form groups to run different types of magazines, exchange them, and compete with each other. During this wartime, when the children's picture magazines of Shanghai's major bookstores have stopped publishing and everyone is clamoring for a lack of spiritual food, why don't the children follow Huimin's method and run a few genuine children's picture magazines themselves, supplying their own spiritual food? At the same time, they can also take this opportunity to practice drawing, writing, and composing.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (13)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>The work of being a representative, although very hard, is still something that many girls want to try. My mother receives letters every day from mothers all over the country, and even from Europe. Those letters are accompanied by photos of their daughters, saying, "Doesn't my daughter look like Shirley? She would be very willing to be Shirley's representative. Would you possibly agree?" But my mother can only write back and refuse one by one, because I already have a representative.</p>
<p>Not long after, my father went back to work at the bank. One day I heard him say to my mother that the situation had not improved, because his salary had been greatly reduced. They thought I wouldn't understand what they were saying, so they didn't avoid me, but when my two older brothers, Jack and Sennan, were nearby, they stopped talking.</p>
<p>My mother wanted to find some work for me in other film companies, but unfortunately, people didn't really need me. In each small film, I only needed to work for one or two days. My father once said to my mother that there was no need to plan for films anymore. He said that there were already three hundred gold dollars in my name in the bank. All the money I had earned from working in seven films in the past year was in it. When I grew up and went to university, it would probably be enough for one semester's tuition.</p>
<p>My mother was always worried that I couldn't have any new developments in the studio. She often said that as long as she could get a contract, she could wait for the opportunity to be in a better position in the film, and she didn't care about the amount of money.</p>
<h3>Crickets</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>Autumn has truly arrived. The cicada's song in the willow trees has been scattered without a trace by the gusts of autumn wind, replaced by the orchestra of crickets. Yong-er has always had a fondness for crickets. In the days before school started, he was already searching for crickets in the corners of walls and in damp soil. As soon as he heard a "qu qu" sound, the cricket would certainly be invited by Yong-er to become a resident in his earthenware pot. Each day, he would be sure to get three meals of white rice and clear water, a much more luxurious life than eating mud under the soil. However, while enjoying these rights, Yong-er expected some obligations from it, which it was quite willing to fulfill. What were those obligations? Yong-er loved to act as a matchmaker for cricket fights. If he caught two, he would put them in the same pot to watch them gnash their teeth and fight for dominance. Hearing a triumphant "qu qu" sound would make Yong-er's heart bloom, he was happy beyond words. Sometimes, the cricket was very cunning and, catching him off guard, would jump and escape. This was not surprising, as it was born with a humble nature and did not deserve such a comfortable life. However, tears would inevitably well up in Yong-er's eyes as he bid it farewell, and he would scold it in his heart as an ungrateful beast.</p>
<p>Later, school started, but his attention to crickets did not diminish. One day, his older brother came over and said to him, "Don't just play with crickets and forget about preparing your lessons. Now is the season for crickets, and you can gain some knowledge about insects by observing them. Have you learned anything?"</p>
<p>"What? I don't understand what you're saying. Crickets are crickets, and insects are insects. What do they have to do with each other?" Yong-er said, shaking his head in surprise.</p>
<p>"You really don't understand. 'Insect' is not just one type of bug. It encompasses a very wide range. Crickets, ants, flies, mosquitoes... all belong to the insect category, and a cricket is just one type of insect.</p>
<p>Look at that cricket: it has a pair of antennae on its head, six legs, membranous wings, and a body divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Its body has segmented rings, which are very hard and made of chitin. This is just the external morphology of a cricket, and it can also be said that all insects have it. It can even be said to be the basic structure of insects. If you don't believe me, you can catch a fly to prove it. These are the basic facts about insects that we must remember. Now, here's a fun thing to do with crickets: go catch a female cricket with a swollen abdomen, commonly called 'San Mi Zi', because the eggs inside her belly are fully developed. At the same time, take a wide-mouthed jar that is five inches deep, and fill it with two inches of soil. The soil should be dry and contain little decaying leaves, so that mold does not grow. Then gently shake the jar to fix the soil so it is easy for her to lay eggs. Put the female cricket in the jar and feed her with eggplant slices. Pay attention to her at all times. Later, you will see that the female has three spines on her rear end, the middle one being the ovipositor. She will insert it into the soil to lay eggs. Eventually, the female will die. Remove her and the eggplant slices together. Then, put a lid on the jar, but not too tightly. It is best to separate the lid with a piece of cardboard. Place the jar in a corner of the house, away from direct sunlight. Wait until early June of next year to see if any baby crickets hatch. Isn't that a very interesting thing to do?" After hearing this, Yong-er, of course, went to try it out.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Forgiveness of Jesus Christ (1)</h3>
<p>Most people think that when a person is suffering, he only thinks about his own pain and has no time to think about others. In fact, when a person is suffering, if he only thinks about his own suffering, he will become more and more bitter, and will blame heaven and others, feeling that others are treating him unfairly, and that there is no justice in the world.</p>
<p>What was Jesus' state of mind when he was on the cross? This is what we all want to know. If Jesus had remained silent on the cross, we would have no way of knowing. Even if we speculated, we would only assume that he was the same as ordinary people, full of resentment, so-called dying with injustice. Fortunately, the authors of the four Gospels have preserved for us the seven sayings of Jesus on the cross, allowing us to know Jesus' state of mind. What is most amazing and admirable is that the first sentence he said was open and honest. He did not resent anyone, he did not reproach anyone, nor did he regret that his years of work had resulted in such an outcome. Instead, he said a sentence full of love and compassion: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34) We can discuss this quote from Jesus in three points:</p>
<p>(1) Jesus practiced his own teachings: Jesus once taught people, "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you..." (Luke 6:27/29) He taught people in this way, and he practiced it in this way. The common problem of people is that they only know how to teach others, but do not know how to teach themselves. Jesus gave us a good example, which is "say what you mean, and mean what you say." Because we should not only be good at teaching others, but also often teach ourselves. Those who cannot teach themselves can never teach others, and will never have the ability to move people. Jesus' prayer did not set any limits as to who could be forgiven and who could not be forgiven. He prayed for all his enemies, Judah who betrayed him, and the Roman soldiers who nailed him, all were included in the forgiveness. Not only the enemies of that day, but also those who are now hostile to him, can equally receive forgiveness. May I ask how universal the scope of forgiveness is? (To be continued on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Impressions of Listening to the Radio</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>High-end consumption means enjoying visual and auditory pleasures to the fullest. Forgoing visual pleasures and only listening to the radio is actually not the worst inexpensive way to pass time. Under this principle, I have become best friends with my radio. However, in the process of listening, I have unintentionally discovered many terrible things.</p>
<p>Recently, a storyteller, in broadcasting an advertisement for a bookstore, introduced a novel called "XX Anecdotes of Romance and the Unusual." He said: "This novel narrates romantic and unusual events in Sichuan. Women in Sichuan embrace polyandry, men and women have freedom of marriage, and women only take one bath every three years." I have no way of knowing the content of this novel, but at least what this storyteller reported in these tidbits is absurd. Sichuan is now the location of the temporary capital. It is not the mysterious Sichuan that people thought it was a few decades ago. The improvement of cultural standards is a matter of course. Even compared to the decadent and licentious isolated island of today, it cannot be compared. This almost defamatory promotion may be a deliberate temptation by the advertising staff, but the storyteller did not carefully consider the impact of the words he introduced. This really deserves attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, a ballad singer, in broadcasting an advertisement for coal briquettes, in addition to stating the advantages and disadvantages of the coal briquettes' firepower, the ballad singer loudly proclaimed that the price would rise immediately, for example, "Today it is six yuan and eight jiao, and the day after tomorrow it will definitely rise to seven yuan and two jiao." Therefore, he shouted loudly: "Listeners may want to hoard some." Moreover, if listeners "do not have a place to store it, they can store the coal briquettes with the store, and if they do not use them, they can sell them on your behalf when the price rises." This seems a bit like training listeners to learn how to hoard and speculate. Today, the wind of speculation on the isolated island is rising from the ashes, stirring up trouble in the air. This is also unacceptable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when a storyteller of heroes spoke of Fang Guozhen's surrender to the Ming Dynasty, he said: "Fang Guozhen is a great man who can bend and stretch, a hero who knows the times." Therefore, he cited the dangers of war, leading to the conclusion that continuous warfare "only causes the people to be displaced and suffer pain." These few words made people feel jarring to hear.</p>
<p>Originally, it is only right not to deeply blame broadcasting performers for having occasional minor errors, such as slips of the tongue, etc., in the condition of lacking restraints in speaking, but errors like those mentioned above will absolutely not be unavoidable. It is hoped that broadcasting performers will correct their errors if they exist, and strive to improve if there are none, so as not to give others an excuse to criticize.</p>

<h3>The National Federation Grand Theater Opens After the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>If all readers are not forgetful, they must still remember the news that the "Palace" on Yu Qiaqing Road would be rebuilt into a second-run national film theater not long ago. But now it has been decided to change it into a first-run theater and rename it "National Federation." According to reliable sources, there are two reasons why the National Federation wants to change to a first-run theater:</p>
<p>First, the contract that Xinhua signed with Jincheng has now expired. Jincheng has enough to cope with the productions of Guohua and Guotai recently, and may even show new films from "Jin Xing", so it will no longer renew the contract with Xinhua. In addition, Xinguang already has a large number of Huaxin productions, and it also has to take time out to show productions from Yihua Hezhong, etc., so it is also overwhelmed. Huguang also has films from Huacheng and Yihua, and also shows second-run Western films, so these two theaters no longer have room for Xinhua to intervene. Seeing this, the National Federation wants to take over the productions of Xinhua, and if there is time, it can show the backlog of new films from Yihua.</p>
<p>Second, the "National Federation" is in a very moderate location, with convenient transportation. There are only the Da Shanghai and Da Guangming Western film theaters on the left and right, and it is also located between Xinguang and Huguang, forming a three-legged stand, so it also has considerable confidence in business.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the "National Federation" will be completed, and according to the person in charge, it has been decided to open after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The first film to be shown will be Xinhua's "Country Girl", starring Yuan Meiyun and directed and co-starring Wang Yin.</p>
<p>Now is the time when fashion films are on the rise. Using this "dark horse film" as the opening film in the new theater will undoubtedly cause a sensation.</p>
<h3>The Da Shanghai Theater's Sale Has Complications</h3>
<p>This publication reported on the 5th on the news of the sale of the Da Shanghai Theater. According to the investigation, the inside story is slightly complicated. Yan Youxiang of the Yi Company had already made up his mind on this matter, but he was the initiator in name, and the nature of the matter was joint investment. After several months of negotiations, there was a breakthrough on the 4th. Both parties agreed to pay 10% of the deposit at 3:00 pm on the 5th, and the handover would take place one month later. Unexpectedly, Yan only paid the money at 4:30 pm. The theater said that the agreed time had passed, and another celebrity had also paid the full amount. The two parties competed for the theater, and as a result, neither party was able to settle the matter. Negotiations are still underway these days, and a decision will be made soon.</p>
<p>The Adventures of Hawsang</p>
<h3>The Whereabouts of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng's eyes moved to Hawsang and me. Hawsang's eyes were not only half-closed, but completely closed. I also felt that this guy's arrogance was unbearable, so I deliberately looked away. When I looked back, I saw that not only Ni Jinshou was embarrassed, but even Lu Jiansheng seemed to be in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng said, "Hawsang is a private detective, isn't he? Then, I can bear this cost, as long as you solve the case quickly."</p>
<p>Hawsang slowly opened his eyes. "Lu Jiansheng! How much are you planning to pay?"</p>
<p>"This—this—you must have a certain amount. Just say how much, and I'll pay it."</p>
<p>"That's unfortunate. I haven't set a fixed fee. Usually, when I investigate cases for people, I never accept rewards—hey, is your Hua Da Bank solely owned or a company?"</p>
<p>"What—what do you mean by that!" His tone was a little annoyed.</p>
<p>Hawsang still said slowly, "I'm telling you, if your bank is a joint-stock company, you're just a manager, then you're not qualified to say that boastful thing. If it's solely owned, then I have to ask you, how much assets do you have in total? Because since you want to use the power of money to drive people, then I have to check whether your money is enough to pay me."</p>
<p>The power in Lu Jiansheng's eyes changed a little. He seemed about to explode, but he was suppressed by Hawsang's calm demeanor, and he couldn't explode. He raised his right hand and put the already extinguished cigar to his mouth, taking a few puffs. He looked at Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou lowered his head, clearly not knowing how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng said falteringly, "What—what is this? Are you joking with me?" (100)</p>
