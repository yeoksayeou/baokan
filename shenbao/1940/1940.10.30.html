<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局形勢烏瞰</h3>
<p>烏瞰歐洲、不妨大體別爲三個體系，亦即三種勢力。第一種：德義的所謂「歐洲新秩序』，在歐洲本身，是澈底建立牠們的覇權：對於一切大小國家，分別予以兼併，統制，或征服：不惜任何手段，製造一個在政治，文化，經濟，甚至關於種族的分佈等方面，完全適合於自已意旨的歐國。牠們絕對吾定凡爾賽和約所造成的一切局面之存在；而其進一步的企圖，即是打敗了歐洲各殖民國家之後，它們廣大的海外殖民地所有權，也就隨同移轉於德義。第二種：與德義相對立的，隱然另成一個集團，自以英國為目前唯一首領。這一集團所主張的根本原則在於確認凡爾賽相的以來，歐洲大小二十餘國獨立存在的合法權利；同時對於海外殖民地分佈現狀，當然在所堅持；即使有何不得巳而有何變動，亦主張在國際聯盟機構的範圍內去進行。第一種，即是雄據北方，睨視歐陸的蘇聯。牠的最大前提，在於確保自已社會主義體系的存在與發展：故其言辭與行動，偏重於鼓勵國際上一切進步的力量，厭惡停滯，允反對開倒車。</p>
<p>這一年多以來來第一與第二種勢力之間，進行着大規模的戰爭：而牠們與第三種勢力的互相間，却同時也在進行着外交戰。這是三種交織而成總體。更事析觀；德義在大陸上具有兩個主要目標，（一）西向的，組成德義法西四國的集團，（二）東向的，完全併吞巴爾幹各國。第一目標以拉攏法國與西班牙加入德義集團為途徑，而以經由西班牙進攻直布羅陀海峽，更越過地中海，一直達到非洲為趨歸。試看最近數天，希特勒·墨索里尼，賴伐爾，佛期哥等四人的動態，已夠象徵着第一目標之演進到現在為止，殆得估暈這一演進的前途，並非根本成敗與吾的問題，而是成就的程度問題；因為德義所誅求於法國的，是要法國現在分散在海外廣大殖民地內的一切海陸空的武力，凡是維希政府權力號召之所及，全部交給德義調遣，而成爲德義對央戰爭機構中的一部分。倘若貝當不接受則德義得使賴伐爾代貝當，總之，不虞維希政權不供驅策；所成為問題者，究有幾處殖民地內的海陸空力量，甘受貝當或賴伐爾的維希號召而已。至於西班牙，她的問題也不是參戰與吾，而祇是如何避免參戰後由封鎖而引起之國家經濟財政以及民間日常生活所必需的物資匱乏問題；匱乏而有若干補救之方，即是追隨德義而參加對英作戰之日。但是在德義隨時加以嚴厲的壓迫，在戰略上發動攻勢的時候，佛朗哥能夠選擇的範圍，也就十分隘狹了。</p>
<p>至於第二目標，德義併吞巴爾幹的工作，最顯著的，先有德國的控制羅馬尼亞，今有義大利的實行進攻希臘，這是露骨而强烈的飛躍。希臘本身原來不夠自力自保，而南斯拉夫與保　利亞兩國萎縮而冷酷的宣佈「中立」，不免打擊了希臘的士氣。故希臘目前抗戰所依恃者，惟有英國；英國必　立即派遣軍艦，搶先佔領克利地島。各府及索羅尼亞等軍港，幷派兵登陸，以堵塞德義的繼續前進；但是這裨益於希臘抗戰全局者。究竟如何。還待今後的事實為說明。此外，倘得土耳其立即與英國共同行動、加以援助，則所得支撑希臘抗戰軍事者。其事功殆得品於一切。</p>
<p>這什英國方面，對於歐洲諸國的外交，步步落後，着着失敗，若以國家為單位而從事比數。則英國日見其孤；好在單位的多少，不即是實力的强弱，故雖孤　不成為悲觀的理由。現在它所致力者，亦有兩對象：（一）緊英美聯繫，借車美國援助的日益增加，完成其抵抗德義更堅强的陣營。（二）糾集其廣大的殖民潛在力量向英帝國的戰爭機構裏，與時俱進的匯合為廣大源流。關於第一對象，意外的得力於德義日三國同盟之簽訂，蓋美國態度因此而更鮮明更積極了。最近義大利某報憤然謂要不是美國援英，則英國的空軍力量或已毀滅了：憤激之談，當然不能恰合分寸，然以美國資源之富與生產力之强，在全力　英的決意下，確可使英國空軍力量迅速增加，甚且可謂可使英國持久不敝。這對於英德間爭取制空權的形勢消長，將無可否認其為一個決定的因素。關於第二對象，最近英屬東半球各屬地的會議自有其百流匯集，萬力奔騰的重大意義。</p>
<p>烏瞰大勢，今日的德義，儼然是內綫的向外延擴，企圖開拓更廣大的出路；而英國則憑藉了海上的覇權，形成對德義的最大包圍。這不是兩綫的平行對立，而是兩圈的內外漲縮。不分攻守，不別主客，是工力悉敵，各自運用了全部力量的拼命。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯態度，直到目前。還是沉着的緘默。但大勢所迫，緘默也有其最大限度；往日歐戰之於蘇聯，是門外的火，向遠處燒去；而前昨義國侵希，牽動了巴爾幹之後，却是鄰近的火向門口燒來了。循此火燄風勢，蘇聯雖沉着，雖欲緘默，也冉不能長久這樣下去了。土耳其是屛蔽於其間的半垜牆！</p>

<p>催促訂購</p>
<p>昨據米糧評價委員會發表意見、希望各界勿冉旁觀、從速參加集團訂購洋米、蓋目前滬市米業市况表面雖已趨穩定、惟在斯國際局勢動盪不定之時、萬一洋米來源中斷、米價勢必再行上漲、該會並將力勸全體同業際茲外滙放長、洋米產價低落之時、大量訂購、以備必時之需、惟每包須由認購者預付國幣四十元一節、際茲民困未復、均感拮据、盼望核减、或另圖其他押購辦法、又寗波同鄕會昨日下午開會、討論同鄕集團購米辦法、</p>

<p>美法新領　職責重要</p>
<p>最近美法等領事均經易人、美新領洛克哈德·及法總領馬傑禮、已先後抵滬履新、各方以美領之地位及其立塲關係、極為矚目、法和界於過去數週中、頗有若干無稽之謠傳、馬氏下車伊始、自當鎭定一切、以慰市民喁望、故兩新領事此番蒞滬、其意義非比往日之僅為各該國外交人員方面之調勳巳也、</p>
<p>召開會議　商討一切</p>
<p>茲聞滬領團為謀聯絡各外領間之感情及泛談滬上一般局勢之動向起見、定於下週召開領事會議一次、聞其最重要之一點、厥為改推領袖領事、因原來之領袖領事義領尼龍氏、巳奉調他職此位至今、尙屬虛　、至其他為適應滬上現在之環境起見、或亦將有所討論、衆信此次會議、為上海整個局面安定之因素、故咸寄以重視也、</p>

<p>昆明損害　並不嚴重</p>
<p>重慶近來電僅昆明於十月—三日遭日轟炸機一隊猛炸一夷為平地」之說、未免過甚其辭、該次空襲、損害雖匪輕、但昆明遠未遭摧毀、該城文化地段、包括雲南大學仟內、指害重大、惟具有重要件之軍事目標容有炸壞者、亦寥寥無幾、參加該次襲擊之日城　十七架、投彈逾百枚、內有重千磅者、史氏在昆明盤桓一周、旋在重慶勾留星期、兩度遇空襲、陪都民氣殊形激昂、空襲警報，民衆以充分躱避之時間、故死傷輕微、史氏在空襲時見民衆絕無驚愕之象、而皆鎭靜如恒云、</p>

<p>傳證調查</p>
<p>再訊在案、咋午郭推事又開民二庭審理該案、原吿周彭齡之代理律師單毓華先將寄存在被吿周梅氏家中之皮箱賬簿呈案、郭推事即據以訊問證人彭伯謙、該賬簿當初是吾由彼等登錄、彭接閱良久、向庭上供稱、是證人所寫、還有周某共同書寫、又據周渭濱到案證稱、昔年遵彭解律師之意旨、</p>
<p>繕函說明</p>
<p>寄存周紫珊處價值二萬元皮衣解決辦法、實不知指多少箱與若干件皮衣、因為當時證人處境極惡、家中被查封、神智不淸、庭上旋問被吿周梅氏、原吿究竟寄存幾多箱子在被吿處、據周梅氏之代理律師稱、實存三十九箱，除十八箱皮衣作為被吿之故夫在民國十六年間、代原吿之故父還裕大錢莊二萬三千餘兩債款之抵償品外、原吿取去—三箱、</p>

<p>晨初以人心尙堅、價亦　定、金號進銀號十兩、為五千四百廿元、作開盤價、較上日收盤計升二十元、後錢兌業售予金號廿兩、為五千四白十元、未幾錢兌業及證券幫猛購百餘兩、價卽上升、計證券幫入金號十兩、為五千四白七十元、嗣因外滙鬆硬、銀號金號俱售、跌達五千四白十五元、但某銀號乘低不斷搜進、故價格盤高、金號進銀號廿兩、一度見五千五百七十元頂盤、又銀號售予金號十兩、回做至五千五百二十五元、結果銀號對做二十兩、為五千五百一十元、作午收價、後市初開銀號錢兌業力進、開盤銀號人金號十兩、吿五千五百四十元、稍頃銀號出證券幫二十兩、為五千五百十五元、斯時金號證劵幫頗有進意、拉起數十元、計銀號對做十兩、為五千五百五十元、惟因銀號多頭急於逢高了結、價又壓小、計金號出銀號十兩、為五千四百九十元、而銀號對做二十兩、復吿五千五百二十元、作晚收價、較上日軋漲一百二十元、全日一百六十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、較烚赤高十餘元、收淮低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金價亦高</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、上午十時掛高十元、以後未更、計大同行懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>向日鈔作投機</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、急亟回漲、英美金鎊因亦一致回起三元、英金票呆定如故、美金票初承隔昨之頹勢、繼續步落、一度退至十五元三角八分、嗣因匯豐及英美行等對黑市美滙吸胃頗佳、故人心轉定、各方需要轉旺、市價步漲、一度抬至十五元九角二分、卒稍退至上五允八角、比上日回起三角、香港票則因供給旺盛、市價繼續下落、晚市退為三元八角六分、比上日續降六分　日金票及朝鮮票均因流通額不多、投機者從中作祟、故市價一再猛漲、前者高至一元五角六分、後者升為一元二角四分、</p>
<p>錢準庫亦减利率</p>
<p>本市錢衆聯合準備庫、昨日通函各會員錢莊略云、定十一月一日起减低劃頭存款利率一厘、卽自十一月一起、各莊存入該庫之劃頭存款、改按年息二厘計算、</p>
<h3>貼現又小</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、仍在步低中、每千元之貼率、初貼進仍八元二角半、貼出九元二角半、下午退至九元、貼准僅八元、比上日又小二角半、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均掛一角二分、</p>
<h3>糧食　今日有八萬餘包　洋米自西貢到滬　買戶日虛市價步落</h3>
<p>今日有大量洋米到滬、係法公司達得南號郵船、自西貢直接運來、計八千噸、的合八萬餘包、預計今日可到埠、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米定貨蜂擁而來、雖有實力大戶意圖支持、然終以供多銷細、人心虛軟、浮戶競脫、市乃步落、回籠路貨英華司在滙市回縮時尙有七十三元之喊聲、但以進少出多、下午實際成交僅七十一元、巳到原包開七十三元七角、後市進戶只吃七十二元、市面疲帶無神、似有再度趨落之必要、且在近日中定貨大部到埠、總計有十萬包以上、故市面與人心在目前殊乏轉機之期望、現貨交易不足五千包、原包亦祗有數十噸、現貨結果、各價計落一元之砠、一號新西貢　開六十六元至六十五元牛、二號六十一元至六十元零五角、火絞高特貨開六十四元七角至六十四元、不過中關者市貨旺盛、致在相軋之下、最為甩透、自六十一二元至五十九元、二號暹邏六十元至五十八元半、小絞五十九元、米菉五十五元至五十四元、碎尖高自五十二元决至四十九元半、蕪湖砶尖五十八元四角至五十八元、似較洋尖略能拷住耳、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種野稻等米、共到一三千石、本街店鉗因見洋米疲跌、納胃亦懈、以是貨主售意較鬆、新粳及窰種比前貶落元砠、計開新粳七十一元半至七十一元、靑角窰種七十叫元至七十三元二角、一時興野稻以貨稀頗堅、站定無化、野稻仍為七十九元、决至七十七元角、一時興七十五元、杜洋尖猶乏榮辱、杜尖開斛見六十六元半、决至六十三元八角、羊尖斛見六十六元、常破開八十五元、</p>
<p>糯米酒戶去　旣滯、而粢飯担銷　亦懈、市色因亦帶軟近元、開宜　貨七十六元、常丹貨七十四元八角至七十四几、香港白元七十一二元、次至六十八九元云、</p>
<h3>粉廠供應漸旺　市面回鬆</h3>
<p>現粉市况、平淡無奇、蓋自近來米價回鬆後、本街現粉實銷、巳不若日前之活潑、更兼各廠供給頻增、轉呈供過於求之勢、回籠貨老車牌、已有傾吐、但受主觀望、聞昨已跌至十八元八角、本街略有購進、洋粉局勢頻軟、因出月初卽有定粉裝到、更値月底期屆、貨方頗有售脫之意、聞高牌旭日當天洋粉僅售十九元半、雙鷹脾己跌進十九元關內、而交易無幾、華粉廠盤仍為十七元、兩廠批出的近萬包、</p>
<p>小麥市况、　擯愈僵、乃因近日來源久稀、偶有零星到貨、亦屬絕無僅有、且大都直接解送日廠、行情亦無軒輊、至於市塲供應、依然缺乏、華廠與內地出口去化亦靜、市面呆頓如故、</p>
<h3>證劵內債外股　仝見下跌</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况變動範圍、漸見擴大、金融界現貨仍在不斷流出、多方漸見出籠、市價乃吿不支、丙戊兩種均敲破九元關而見八元五角最近低價、昨日上午初做平穩、順昌信孚頗有買進、抬高二三角、後以久豐鴻大賣出甚湧、終仍回落二三角、午收高低互見、上落甚微、午後裕興又有大批賣出、同康多頭漸有出籠、聯益鴻大亦有吐出、久豐益昌及樂茂均有出脫、鼎康聯利甡昶雖買進甚多、終未能維持丙戊種遽打破九元關而見八元五角行市、後以散戶買進而稍稍回上一二角、市氣已頹暫難立定、市價結果、除丁種全日未有做開外、餘均一致回跌五角半至九角、成交的有一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤比前日</p>
<p>統甲六七·七五　六七·二〇六七·二〇跌〇·八〇</p>
<p>統乙六一·九〇　六一·三〇六一·三〇跌〇·五一</p>

<p>統丁——　——　——　——</p>
<p>統戊五九·四五　四八·三五八五·四五跌〇·九〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成文仁元地產公司股五十股、價為二十五元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤似有普遍　高之象、會德豐首吿上漲、蓋信其股息將立卽宣布也、上午收盤、竟漲達九十一元高價、下午開盤、該股正式發表派息五元、但衆對此數似感失望、價格於是步落至八十五元半收盤、餘股之在上午見漲者、至此亦俱回落、祇怡和啤酒股雖在重重壓力下猶能維持堅勢、橡皮股仍被忽視、蓋實業股之成交極端龐大也、</p>
<p>倫敦二十八日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗空投　更見活躍</h3>
<p>連朝在升之紗市、在此四日中慘落百元、此種反動下挫、亦在情理之中、不過如斯大上大下、使人可畏實則價格巳入高境、容易變化、加之現銷稍淸、而外滙長風益厲、允使高價購進之戶、心思不安、活動了結、市盤乃迅速回跌、據市塲言、通棉巳抵滬數千包、因之空方在遠期大為活動、市態愈形衰弱、</p>
<p>現紗晨凱因上日人心駕惶流言皆屬利空、塲上賣者較夥、二十支雙馬首盤價為一千二百十五元、一時賣風奇熾、直跌全一千二百零二元、低價一見、一般上日拋空之戶、從速扒補、又復回升至一千二百十四元、此時外滙開市復見放長、賣風再起、重見一千二百零三元、稍形迴旋、聞交易所行市趨昂、及外滙改縮、市盤逐步轉機、而漲至一千二百二十七元、收盤略回平、為一千二百二十三元、查半日間成交統計七千七百七十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十七元、新生廠開出四十支金虎二百包、價為一千四百七十元、二十支金虎三百包、價為一千一百五十元、十八支金虎二百包、價為一千零三十元、查棉紗今日有七十五件運往香港、又四十件、運往暹避、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港五四〇　同行六·五〇〇</p>
<p>內地七三〇　統計七、七七〇</p>
<h3>棉花市况沉寂</h3>
<p>現棉交易、轉　沉寂、良以紗市跌風劇烈、原棉略受刺激矣、所以行情帶疲、成交殊鮮、</p>
<p>常陰沙二四〇·〇〇　德豐二〇〇包</p>
<p>火機花三二四·〇〇　德豐進二三六包</p>
<p>大中集二四三·〇〇　盛和淮二〇一件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、市况靜寂、因缺乏重要之買戶、續後又因海外棉商之賣出、結果收盤價格較之上日降落四五磅音、印度昨日連同預測無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因滙兌鬆長、各方咸抱觀望態度、然市上存底不豐、故市價始終未能轉廉也、同業間之心思、仍然異常堅定、</p>
<h3>疋頭　步價復升</h3>
<p>廠布昨市鬆懈、以紗價暴跌小回、人心忐忑、國布售盤較穩、浮囤傾向賣出且月底巳屆、散戶亦有吐售、惟買戶觀望、僅零星實銷略有成交、售盤一部份、細布色布每疋續跌二角半、粗布跌一角至二角半、廠盤及大戶囤貨仍堅持不放、本街成交坯布漂染印花布三百餘件、溫州帮辦粗細布嗶嘰等二百餘件、閩帮辦細布色斜等近百件、粵港帮辦色布等二百餘件、北路烟津帮辦藍布粗布絨布等一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布昨因本街實銷良好、同業心思看高、白貨細布細斜回升、每疋五六角、市塲上之交易、以中擋各牌細布居多數、成交的六七百件、龍頭嗶嘰轉趨岑寂、足徵染坯實需不薄、收盤時龍頭細布售三十七元二角、四君子嗶嘰一元一角四分七五、</p>
<p>今日有疋頭二十五件、運往仰光、又三百八十件、運往香港、又七件、運小呂宋、又一百十五件、運暹羅、又七十五件、運新加坡、</p>
<h3>油餅　油市奄無生氣</h3>
<p>咋日油市依然無牛氣、刻下搬出證雖有續發、但出路狹隘、難以引起興趣、况到存兩厚、期貨籌碼又逐見放長、故其市氣一蹶不振、四戶面似鎭定、心頗懊喪、統市計開膠州豆油五十件、價為七十五元、大有廠豆油二百祖、價為八十五元八十四元二角半、膠州生油三百件、價為六十九元五角至六十八元五角、烟台生油五十件、價為六十九元、靑島生油十一月上交二百五十桶、價為九十八元至九十六元角半、十一月下交三百五十桶、價為九十九元至九十七元二角半、十二月下交叫百桶、價為一百元至九十九元、</p>
<p>又黄豆昨由天津來六百十句、又來桐油一百八十四件、　出口雜糧有豆子二百包、三十日運往香港、又六百包、運往新加坡、又二百五十包、運往小呂宋、又有蔴油一百五十件、及牛油一千聽、運往香巷、</p>

<h3>關於「重整道德」</h3>
<p>— 陸洋</p>
<p>本月一日我在本報裏發表了一篇對醫務工作者的呼籲的文字以後，從編輯先生那裏轉來了一封讀者王君的信，除了同情這個呼籲之外，並謂當此社會道德敗壞的過程中，我們應該提倡「重整道德」。「重整道德」的意義是一我們每個人下新的決心，提倡一種新的生活，以誠實。淸潔。無私。博愛為原則的生活，是以上帝管理的生活，而挽回今日的道德淪亡。」對于王君提倡道德的熱情，與他能針對現時一般人的虛浮，自私而提倡以上幾種美德，那的確使我很欽佩。不過我寫作前文的時候，其實倒也並沒有奢望它將眞的對現實有多少補益，我只僅僅希望以此促起社會人士對這問題的注意而巳。這不是自謙，事實上，我很明白，醫務工作者對一般病人的疏忽或甚至岐視，是有他的複雜的原因的，豈僅只是「道德」的問題而巳！</p>
<p>不可否認的，所謂道德，不過是社會的意識形態之一，而某一社會的意識形態却是被這個社會的經濟組織所決定的；換言之，卽經濟是一個社會的下層基礎，而政治。法律，宗敎，道德。藝術等都是它的上層建築，所以如果我們儘以重整道德而改善些這個社會的道德，那是可能的，如果說要根本改良這個社會的道德制度，那宋它將使我們感到失望了！試想，最近米價這樣貴，我們能夠使一個米蛀蟲去　到道德問題而將他所　的米全數送給飢民嗎？那簡直是不可想象的事了！他逍遙在法律之外，而是一個去偷了囤戶米車上一把白米的人，却有資格背了一個罪名被拖到監獄裹去，這就是這個社會的道德　　，有什麼話好說呢？前　天史　先生在本報一篇從監獄人滿說起中就明白指出那些犯法的監犯太多是被生活的需要所驅使，因為道個社會不能給他們解決生活問題而因此引起他們的挺而走險，那又豈僅是「道德」的問題而已！</p>
<p>所以我想提倡眞正的道德，如果只以車整道德為改良的手段，那倒不如讓我們去找出所以使現時道德淪亡的基本原因而努力使它合理化起來為首要。</p>
<h3>難纏·簽字·醫師的責任</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>十月四日見貴刊載陸洋女士「以最高度的警惕執行我們的任務」一文，讀了使我潛然淚下，回憶我亡妻生產慘死，「是醫師玩忽？一「是病症使然？」以經過情形閃突，怎不使我無限悲痛，茲詳述經過，懇望先生披露，以使醫師與做丈夫者同仕女們多多注意。</p>
<p>亡妻產前很健，入院前及入院時皆曾檢查。臨產生時，醫師全無報吿，數少時後，我親到院探視，回說尙未分娩；請求與產婦見面，則在待產室，本准進內，無奈祗得怏怏回家，靜候佳音。未到家二小時，院方來一使者，召我速卽到院，我想定已分娩；一到院，那曉得我可憐的妻在太平問裹全身纏着紗布，巳與我永別了。我那時一慟幾絕，急問如何致死？回說難產同心臟病；再責產前　檢查，為何無心臟病報吿，况執行手術，為什麼不微求家屬同意與簽字？所答之詞支吾閃鑠。我因信仰醫院規模宏大，醫師手術高明，又因經濟關係，祗得自認悔氣，悲嘆而巳。</p>
<p>見了陸洋女士的文章，我始恍然大悟，原來醫院內有的醫師同助產士的冷漠態度，及不負其全責等情，想我妻之死定是疎忽同失責所致呢。我雖不知李夫人之原因，諒也其中之一吧。</p>
<p>我下面有幾點疑問，祈請社會人士作一檢討。</p>
<p>（一）產婦患心臟病，於生產時是　很危險，若產婦到院時，曾經醫師檢查，認為沒有心臟病，在臨產前數少時能吾突生心臟病？</p>
<p>（二）這種心臟病於生命是吾有妨</p>
<p>（三）在醫師知經知道產婦患有心臟病，則常時救治大人，還是保全嬰孩？</p>
<p>（四）醫院有定章，難產施行手術前定要家屬簽字，不過在產前一月同臨產時巳經醫師檢查，並塡有表格，證明不致難產，在臨產時沒有共他的變化，能吾突變難產？</p>
<p>（五）如以上情形，醫師施行手術前，是吾要徵求家屬同意與簽字？</p>
<p>（六）即未經屬簽字，而院力遂行手術，以致不測，院方同醫師是吾負完全責任？陳憐叩上</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的婦宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>皮鞋問題</p>
<p>霍桑也向東走，巳在大同路的轉角上停住。老毛也站在他旁邊。我奔近去一瞧，地上躺着一個人，就是那老頭兒李芝範！</p>
<p>這時我們都沒有說話。我瞧瞧地上的李芝範，身體蜷曲着，橫側地倒在地上，身上還是穿着那件深靑色縐紗的駱駝絨袍子，足上一雙雙樑布底玄緞面的鞋子。他的眼睛緊閉，嘴脣張開，在那　喘息、我明知他已中槍，但不知打在什麽地方。霍桑已蹲下了身子，用手解老人胸襟的紐扣。我才見他裏面襯衣的右胸膛口，有着鮮紅的血漬。</p>
<p>霍桑斜側着頭，向我說：「包郎，快去打一個電話到警廳裡去，叫他們派救護車來。」</p>
<p>我立即旋轉身子，奔進門口裏去。金梅正伏在鐵門裏面發怔。我將　推在一邊，急步奔進屋子，一步三級地跨上樓梯，在樓梯的轉折處，撥動電話機的號碼。這電話打得很順利，前後不過一兩分鐘。倪金壽還在廳裏。這消息當然也出他的意外。他答應馬上就來。</p>
<p>我回到外面轉角上時，霍桑巳站直了身子，正拿幾張好像從李芝範身上搜得的紙，放進他自己的衣袋裹去。他的神氣當然很緊張，但並不慌亂。那老毛依舊站在他旁邊，那慌張的神態，却讓他一個人包辦了。我吿訴霍桑倪金壽馬上就來。霍桑但點點頭。他又向街的對面和兩端瞧了一瞧，瞧着老毛說話。</p>
<p>「你比我先出來，可曾瞧見什麼？」</p>
<p>老毛張着小眼，點頭說：「瞧見的—我瞧見那姓趙的趙伯雄。」</p>
<p>霍桑不答，也沒有特殊驚訝的神氣，但閉緊了嘴，像在尋思什麼。</p>
<p>我禁不住說：「哎喲，又是這傢伙！眞厲害！」霍桑也不接嘴，又向老毛說：「你會不會瞧錯？」老毛搖頭說：「不會，我奔到道轉角時，見有兩個人向北飛奔，一個人向南跑。」他用手向大同路的南北兩端各指一指。「那向北面去的兩個人奔得巳遠，我當然瞧不淸楚；向南邊逃的一個還很近，我瞧得很淸楚，眞是那個高個子姓趙的。他的背影我巳瞧慣了，不會錯。」（一五一）</p>
<h3>「看獲」責任</h3>
<p>— 雲似</p>
<p>六月二十四日的晚上，我忽然覺得身體發熱。第二天連飲食都不進；但是。為着業務上，只好抖擻精神，繼續工作。這樣的一天天挨下去，到了七月五日熱度更加高，委實有些支持不住了。</p>
<p>那時候，敝友某君，力主入新闡路某醫院治療。於是，我乃於這天上午十時二十分鐘入院，當時辦淸入院手續，由一工役扶我進病房。那病房的佈置，是三間相連的，中間的一間，是附設着看護處的，時時刻刻總有二三位看護候看護理病人的。可是，郤巧當我抵病房時，只有一位看護，在桌子上俯着打磕睡。那個工役便高聲喊了好些時候，「小姐，有新病人來了，快安排舖位吧！」那位看護方始抬起頭，慢吞吞地立起來；還打着懶腰，好像沒有睡够的樣子。但，只好走過來實行她的職務。的莫半小時光景，床舖總算鋪好了，可是我巳坐得頭暈眼花，只得倒頭便睡，並因為發熱厲害，我便趁此要求着說：「小姐，快來替我量一量熱度吧！」那看護聽了道話，立刻沉下了臉地說：「你這人眞煩！」的一句話就走了。</p>
<p>我忍者痛苦，直到五點多鐘，有三位醫生進病房來了。那時候，那位看護，叉在桌子上俯着打磕睡，正當醫生走近看護處時，那看護却被皮鞋聲驚醒了，便紅着臉兒，急忙把「却踢」（Chart）拿出來，其中有一位醫生接了「却踢」走到我的舖邊，先替我診治，開好藥方，還對着看護說：「等一會兒你替他通一决大便！」那裹知道那看護聽了道話，就說：「眞討厭！又要通大便了。」接着便把「却踢」很用氣力的推進廚裹，嘭的一聲，好似手溜彈爆炸一樣地饗，速那些熟睡着的外傷病友們都被　醒。</p>
<p>總之：那位看護，每天只是意氣用事的詈駡，那些病友們差不多每個無不怨聲載道，暗叫苦地忍受着。</p>
<p>照看護兩字分開來說：「看」是看管病人的，「護」是保護病人的，像這種規模宏大的醫院，我以為不應有這樣不守本位的看護。要知道看護在「看護」病人之外，更應該有「安慰」之心，那裏可以使病人更受刺激呢？我希望一般看護小姐們！有則改之，無則加勉　！（却酬）</p>

<h3>音樂史上第一頁　—奧斯陸被佔的迴憶</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>奧斯陸（Oslo），為挪威國都，居民二十五萬，於本年四月九日被德軍佔領，此事雖巳成明日黄花，然因其經過情形頗堪令人回味，特將芝加哥每日新聞所載，摘譯於下，以嚮本刋讀者。</p>
<p>前此德軍進攻該城，先鋒部隊祇一千五百人，到達後因人數過少軍事武器未曾動用，採用了一種以音樂催眠人心的方法，他們先分成了數小隊，各帶了樂器在衝要大道旁吹奏德國的華爾滋曲及美國的在歡曲，其中有一隊是在國務院的階前演奏；奧斯陸的居民可憐得很，一羣一羣的蜂擁上去，個個興高采烈的爭奪着欣賞音樂，而忘記了站在面前的就是敵人，結果就使一千五百個德軍整天未遇抵抗而佔領了一個有二十五萬人口的大城市！</p>
<p>二日後，又有一慕相同的「喜劇」在當地演出，這時是德國的主力軍隊到了，總數共二萬；登陸的半小時內，碼頭上祗能聽釗大合唱的聲音，步兵隊在前，砲兵隊在中，運輸隊繼後，一面上岸，一面都在嘴內唱着一支叫「到城市去」“Going　to　Town”的德國名曲，奧斯陸的人民看見了這種現象後依舊相信着不會有什麼嚴重的事情已經發生。</p>
<p>到了最後，漆有卍字的飛機成羣在空中飛翔郤不擲炸彈，奧斯陸的人民方才覺悟自己的國都是淪陷了，要抵抗亦巳太晚了！德國的亡挪，是以軍事與音樂的力量相輔而行的，這在音樂史上，我們亦該把這件事記上一頁吧！</p>

<h3>善歌唱之姚莉女士，近亦常在影壇客串。</h3>

<h3>南鐵生來滬有期</h3>
<p>— 渴雲樓主</p>
<p>以漢口「梅蘭芳」著稱之南鐵生，去秋　　黃金，與論頗佳，予滬人印象殊深，　以北地大水，配演各角未能　集，難於一展所長，抵演局餘而　，遽賦北歸，刻又應黄金之的，接演玉華後隊，此來携有鬚生楊寳森，小生一席，決以俞振飛蟬聯云。</p>
<p>楊實森行腔勁　，對於叔岩晚年之秦腔，甚有心得，頗見近似，已有美評在先，俞振飛崑亂不　，根底極深，演來不火不溫，溫文爾雅，每及劇情緊張之處，熱情流露，聲　俱下，尤爲獨特，當今小生行中，可稱獨步，自與玉霜分離，即與鐵生合作，出演華北各埠，聲　　起，且二人私誼極　，故振飛之與　秋合演，亦抵以南來爲限也，鐵生有振飛爲輔，牡丹綠葉，可謂相得益彰，梅浣華出演無期，黄桂秋有嗓無相，獨鐵生色藝變絕，無暇可擊，此次南下公演，劇　天才，定能發揮無遺也。</p>

<h3>Guangxi's Chinese Army Enters Nanning, Zhejiang's Shaoxing City Also Recovered, Nanning City Set Ablaze as Japanese Forces Retreat Towards Qinzhou, Japanese Troops in Longzhou Area Retreat Towards Zhennanguan and Vietnamese Border</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Official sources here recently announced that the Chinese army in eastern Zhejiang has already recovered Shaoxing. (Havas Agency, 29th) Chinese forces in a certain area of eastern Zhejiang recovered Shaoxing city at 3 PM on the 28th, capturing a large number of enemy soldiers. They are currently pursuing and annihilating the remaining Japanese forces. (Urgent telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to this morning's official announcement, Chinese forces have recovered Shaoxing city. Japanese forces invaded the city at the end of last week. The Chinese army immediately launched a counterattack. After fierce fighting, the Japanese forces were driven out and are now retreating north towards Xiaoshan. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Official sources here announced that Chinese forces entered Nanning at 9 PM yesterday. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a telephone call received from Liuzhou this afternoon, large numbers of Chinese troops are expected to enter Nanning before nightfall today. Before retreating last night, Japanese troops set fires in the city, which are still burning. The Chinese army advancing south along the Bin-Nan highway crossed Wutang this morning and continued towards Nanning, reaching Santang in the afternoon. Japanese troops in Nanning are currently retreating south towards Qinzhou. According to Chinese sources, other Japanese troops retreating from the Longzhou area are retreating towards Zhennanguan and the Vietnamese border. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Nanning, which was captured by Japanese forces on October 24th last year, has now been completely evacuated by the Japanese. Japanese rear-guard troops set fire to a 300-meter-long bridge on the Xijiang River to prevent the Chinese army from pursuing. The Japanese army retreated in an orderly manner and did not encounter armed Chinese forces. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>A certain area of eastern Zhejiang – After the Japanese forces in Xiaoshan invaded Shaoxing, they were blocked and attacked by Chinese forces for several consecutive days. At dawn on the 28th, Chinese forces near Shaoxing launched a counterattack, advancing bravely. The Japanese forces in the city showed signs of collapse. After fierce fighting until noon, Chinese forces entered the west gate and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese. Due to heavy casualties, the Japanese set fire to civilian houses and retreated. Chinese forces then recovered Shaoxing at 3 PM. There are currently no Japanese troops near Shaoxing city. (Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Jinhua – Japanese forces occupying Shaoxing city have been surrounded and pressured by Chinese forces for the past two days, and subjected to constant attacks, leaving them no room to breathe. At the same time, their lines of communication were cut off. At dawn on the 28th, Chinese forces began attacking the city, entering through the Wuyun Gate, where fierce fighting occurred. When they entered the Zhong Gate in the afternoon, the Japanese forces collapsed and retreated. Chinese forces then completely recovered the county. (Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Today's military communiqué states that after a round of fierce fighting yesterday, Shaoxing was recovered. The Japanese army is currently retreating towards the mountains. According to Chinese authorities, they hope that Japanese forces in Guangxi and southwestern Guangdong will be completely driven out. Official sources believe that Japanese forces may be transferred to Hainan Island, as the winter climate is better there and supplies are more convenient. Once reorganized, they may attempt a new adventure in the Dutch East Indies. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to battle reports from the front lines of the Chinese army in southern Guangxi, after Chinese forces captured key strongholds outside Nanning in a general offensive, the vanguard has advanced to the outskirts of Nanning. The recovery of the city is imminent. The Chinese army in southern Guangxi launched a general offensive on October 23rd, surrounding Nanning from all sides. One column from Binyang attacked Santang, 10 miles north of Nanning, along the highway. Another column attacked from Jiandaoxu, east of Nanning. Chinese forces west of Nanning have already recovered Shibu. On October 25th, Japanese forces, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a fierce counterattack along the Wuming-Nanning highway, but were unable to stop the advance of the Chinese army. At the same time, Chinese forces on the south bank of the You River launched a general offensive on the Japanese forces occupying Longzhou area on the night of October 27th. After a night of fierce fighting, they completely recovered the city at 5:30 AM yesterday. Other Chinese columns also recovered Mingjiang and Suilu, key cities on the highway between Longzhou and Nanning. Chinese forces on the north bank of the You River are now approaching the outskirts of Nanning. Chinese forces on the west have cut off traffic between Nanning and the Vietnamese border. Other Chinese forces are threatening the highway between Nanning and the coast. Japanese forces in Nanning city are currently retreating, planning to reach the coast via Beihai and Qinzhou, fearing being completely surrounded by the Chinese army. All sectors of the Chinese community here are overjoyed at the imminent recovery of Nanning, as this will be the first provincial capital recovered in three years of fighting. This will boost the morale of the Chinese army and further strengthen the general public's confidence in the fighting power of the Chinese army. The Chinese victory in southern Guangxi will also create a good impression overseas, convincing the United Kingdom and the United States that the Chinese army is capable of dealing with the Japanese army, and their aid to China will certainly be more enthusiastic. According to sources here, once Nanning is recovered, the Burma Road and Kunming can be kept safe. Military experts believe that Yunnan province only fears an attack from the east, and now that the entire eastern wing is in the hands of the Chinese army, Yunnan province can rest easy. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Sources here claimed this morning that the Chinese army has won repeated victories and has recovered three other locations besides Nanning. Nanning is the largest city occupied by the Chinese army after its counteroffensive. The city fell on November 24th last year. It is understood that the Japanese army began to retreat when the Chinese army approached within artillery range of the city. It was announced here that Longzhou, Mingjiang, and Suilu have also been recovered by the Chinese army. It is reported that yesterday, when the Japanese army retreated to Fengshan, Zhennanguan, Ningming, and the Yong-Qin highway west of Nanning, the Chinese army attempted to pursue them. It is also reported that Japanese troops in various parts of southern Guangxi retreated at the same time. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the Chinese army's great victory in southern Guangxi, experienced Chinese observers here recently stated that after Japanese forces entered Vietnam, they believed that China's external route had been cut off, and there was talk of abandoning Nanning. However, the Chinese army had already prepared to launch a timely counteroffensive, and recently launched an offensive with elite troops in separate directions, stepping up the pressure. One route pressed towards Nanning, fought fiercely for three days, and finally recovered it. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Another route advanced directly to Longzhou, northwest of Nanning, and also recovered it at the same time. Taking advantage of the victory, they also recovered Mingjiang and Suilu, north of Longzhou. In short, this decisive victory in southern Guangxi is of great significance. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Chinese sources here report that the Chinese army recovered Longzhou, Mingjiang, and Suilu in southwestern Guangxi province yesterday morning, and also won a decisive victory behind the Japanese forces slowly escaping from the southwestern Chinese encirclement. The old site of the Guangxi provincial government, Nanning, was previously recovered by the Chinese army after three days of fierce fighting, not long before the recovery of these three important cities. News from the wartime capital of China reaching here states that Chongqing considers the success of the Chinese army's recovery of past Japanese strongholds to be extremely important due to its strategic value. It is expected that the Chinese army will advance further south, as Japanese forces in southwestern China clearly want to abandon most of the strongholds they previously held. It is also reported that Chinese guerrillas in the Dongjiang area are preparing to launch a large-scale counteroffensive against Japanese forces in the southern section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (International News, 29th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Military sources in Chongqing claimed yesterday that Nanning has been recovered after three days of fierce fighting. Observers believe this news is of great significance, as Nanning is the capital of Guangxi province, and the Japanese army occupied the city on January 24th, 1939, and is said to have heavily fortified it. At the same time, news received here states that Japanese troops who broke through the French forces in Xinyi (transliteration) did not return along the original route, but have withdrawn from Haiphong to Taiwan and are temporarily ceasing operations. According to Chinese sources, these Japanese troops were cut off by the Chinese army, but broke through the encirclement and entered Vietnam. Observers believe that the Chinese statement has been confirmed. (International News, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – News of the Chinese army's recovery of Nanning has been informally confirmed. According to the initial Chinese reports, Chinese troops in southern Guangxi actively advanced along the highway from Binyang to Nanning, engaging in fierce fighting with Japanese forces and inflicting heavy damage. This morning, official sources here announced that the Chinese army has approached the outskirts of Nanning and the Japanese army has shown signs of retreat, advancing into the city and recovering it shortly thereafter. Subsequently, news was received that Mingjiang, northwest of Nanning, has also been recovered. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Southern Advance Policy Seems to Have Temporarily Halted, May Attempt to Invade Kunming from Vietnam, But Terrain Will Make It Very Difficult, Americans Express Joy at Chinese Army's Victory</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Due to the resolute attitude expressed by the United States and the United Kingdom, Japan's southern advance appears to have temporarily halted. However, it is rumored that the Japanese may launch from Vietnam in an attempt to invade Kunming, so as to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road and threaten the southwestern provinces. Military experts believe that the Japanese invasion of Kunming will be very difficult due to the terrain and lack of convenient transportation. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – The news of the Chinese army's victory in recovering Nanning from Chongqing, if confirmed, is considered by those familiar with Far Eastern affairs as an appropriate response to the Japanese claim that influential Chinese people are negotiating peace with Japan. Eastern news received here indicates that Japan is now extremely eager to find a suitable way to end the war in China, probably because it is shifting its speculative actions to the Indochina Peninsula, so as to obtain faster and more generous gains than it has gained in the three years of bloody battles in China, which have consumed manpower, financial resources and material resources, or because the strong attitude of the United States has forced Japan to concentrate its remaining forces in areas outside central China. News from Tokyo in the past few days has shown that Japan now knows that the United States is consistent in its words and deeds, and is not comparable to empty threats, and Japan's recent recall of its diplomatic representatives to the United States is also related to this. It is said here that the diplomatic representatives to the United States failed to accurately report the trends of American sentiment, such as newspapers and public opinion, to Nanjing, which is also one of the reasons for their withdrawal to their country. The trend of American sentiment does not change because of Japanese rhetoric, such as that of Suma, the spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Suma's derogatory remarks against President Roosevelt have had the opposite effect, causing undecided Americans to vote for those whom Japan does not want to be elected. Secretary of State Hull's remarks on Saturday are seen as confirming continued American aid to China, or that the US authorities may not take further action in the Far East immediately, but if Japan takes any aggressive steps, the United States will inevitably respond.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the European Situation</h3>
<p>A bird's-eye view of Europe can be broadly divided into three systems, that is, three forces. The first: the so-called "New European Order" of Germany and Italy, in Europe itself, is to thoroughly establish their hegemony: for all countries, large and small, they will be annexed, controlled, or conquered separately: without hesitating any means, they will create a European country that is completely suitable for their own intentions in politics, culture, economy, and even in the distribution of races. They absolutely negate the existence of all the situations created by the Treaty of Versailles; and their further attempt is that after defeating the European colonial countries, the ownership of their vast overseas colonies will also be transferred to Germany and Italy. The second: standing opposite to Germany and Italy, another group is implicitly formed, with Britain as the only current leader. The fundamental principle advocated by this group is to confirm the legitimate rights of the independent existence of more than 20 large and small countries in Europe since the Versailles Treaty; at the same time, it is of course insisted on the current situation of the distribution of overseas colonies; even if there is any unavoidable change, it is also advocated to be carried out within the scope of the League of Nations organization. The first is the Soviet Union, which dominates the north and looks down on the European continent. Its biggest premise is to ensure the existence and development of its own socialist system: therefore, its words and actions focus on encouraging all progressive forces internationally, abhorring stagnation, and opposing backsliding.</p>
<p>For more than a year, a large-scale war has been going on between the first and second forces: and at the same time, a diplomatic war is also going on between them and the third force. These are three intertwined into an overall. More analytically, Germany and Italy have two main goals on the mainland, (1) westward, to form a group of four countries, Germany, Italy, France and Spain, and (2) eastward, to completely annex the Balkan countries. The first goal takes the route of attracting France and Spain to join the German and Italian group, and aims to attack the Strait of Gibraltar via Spain, cross the Mediterranean Sea, and reach Africa all the way. Looking at the movements of Hitler, Mussolini, Laval, Franco and others in the past few days, it is enough to symbolize that the evolution of the first goal has reached the present. It is almost estimated that the future of this evolution is not a fundamental issue of success or failure, but a question of the degree of achievement; because what Germany and Italy are seeking from France is to hand over all the naval, land and air forces of France, which are now scattered in vast overseas colonies, to the disposal of Germany and Italy, as far as the power of the Vichy government can call, and become a part of the German and Italian war machine against the center. If Pétain does not accept it, Germany and Italy can make Laval replace Pétain. In short, there is no worry that the Vichy regime will not be driven. The problem is, in how many colonies are the naval, land and air forces willing to be called upon by Pétain or Laval. As for Spain, her problem is not whether to participate in the war or not, but how to avoid the lack of national economic and financial resources and the materials necessary for the daily life of the people caused by the blockade after participating in the war; if there are some remedies for the lack, it is the day when she follows Germany and Italy and participates in the war against Britain. However, when Germany and Italy impose severe pressure at any time and launch an offensive strategically, the scope that Franco can choose is very narrow.</p>
<p>As for the second goal, Germany and Italy's work of annexing the Balkans, the most obvious is first Germany's control of Romania, and now Italy's implementation of an attack on Greece, which is a naked and strong leap. Greece itself was originally not enough to protect itself, and the shrunken and cold declaration of "neutrality" by Yugoslavia and Bulgaria inevitably hit the morale of Greece. Therefore, Greece currently relies on Britain for its resistance; Britain must immediately send warships to seize the military ports of Crete, etc., and Salonica in advance, and send troops to land to block Germany and Italy's continued advance; but what is the benefit to the overall situation of Greece's resistance? We still have to wait for the facts to explain in the future. In addition, if Turkey immediately takes joint action with Britain and provides assistance, then the support for Greece's resistance war can almost be compared to everything.</p>
<p>On the British side, its diplomacy with European countries has lagged behind step by step and failed step by step. If the countries are used as units to compare the numbers, Britain is increasingly isolated; fortunately, the number of units is not the strength or weakness of the strength, so even if it is isolated, it does not become a reason for pessimism. Now it is also working on two objects: (1) to strengthen the British-American connection, and to complete its resistance to Germany and Italy with the ever-increasing assistance from the United States. (2) to gather its vast colonial potential forces into the British Empire's war machine and converge into a vast source with the times. Regarding the first object, it unexpectedly benefited from the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, because the American attitude became clearer and more active. Recently, a certain Italian newspaper angrily said that if it were not for the American aid to Britain, Britain's air force might have been destroyed: of course, the angry remarks cannot be accurate, but with the wealth of American resources and the strength of production, under the full determination to aid Britain, it can indeed enable the British air force to increase rapidly, and even can be said to enable Britain to last for a long time without being exhausted. This will undoubtedly be a decisive factor for the rise and fall of the situation of the competition for air supremacy between Britain and Germany. Regarding the second object, the recent meeting of the British-owned territories in the eastern hemisphere has its great significance of a hundred streams converging and ten thousand forces rushing.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, today's Germany and Italy are like internal lines extending outwards, trying to open up a wider way out; while Britain, relying on its naval hegemony, has formed the largest encirclement of Germany and Italy. This is not the parallel opposition of two lines, but the inward and outward expansion of two circles. Without distinguishing between offense and defense, without distinguishing between the host and the guest, it is a desperate fight where the workers use all their strength and each uses all their strength.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union's attitude, until now. It is still silent. But forced by the general trend, silence also has its maximum limit; in the past, the European War for the Soviet Union was a fire outside the door, burning to the distance; but yesterday's Italian invasion of Greece, after affecting the Balkans, was a fire nearby burning to the door. Following this flame and wind, even if the Soviet Union is calm and wants to be silent, it cannot continue like this for a long time. Turkey is half a wall shielding it in between!</p>

<h3>Soviet-Japanese Treaty; Atmosphere Again Appears Ominous; Jianchuan Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>While the Soviet Union in London is adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards the Balkan war, reliable sources arriving here say that Moscow is eager to conclude an agreement with Japan.

The agreement will also stipulate that the Soviet Union recognizes "Manchukuo," while Japan recognizes the Soviet Union's dominant position in "Outer Mongolia" and Xinjiang, and the right to station troops in these two regions. The long-standing Soviet-Japanese fishery dispute will also be resolved in this round of negotiations. However, the Soviet Union will reject Japan's requests to stop providing military aid to China and its proposal for a Soviet-Japanese partition of China.

<h3>Roosevelt's Campaign Speech; Vigorously Defends National Defense Policy; Accuses Republicans of Lacking Foresight; The Precedent of France's Failure Serves as a Warning</h3>
<p>New York, President Roosevelt last night at Madison Square Garden accused Republican leaders of lacking foresight on national defense issues. The President declared that the policies of responsible Republican leaders on national defense affairs are cowardly, weak, and shortsighted. It must be known that France's failure was the result of such cowardly and shortsighted policies, and England only realized the fallacy of this policy until the final period of crisis. The fact that the Republicans treated national defense issues as child's play in 1938 and 1939 is obvious. Even today, the party is still engaging in games on the issue of national security. The President also said that the Republicans' votes in Congress are tantamount to a work slowdown on the executive branch's continued efforts to increase national defense and deal with the unprecedented crisis. The President also accused former President Hoover, Senators Vandenberg and Taft, and Representative Fish, among other Republican leaders, of trying to obstruct the progress of national defense. The President also said that Republican campaign speakers have said that America's rearmament is too slow and incomplete and can never cope with foreign threats, and he only finds such remarks absurd. President Roosevelt's speech was broadcast nationwide. Before this important speech, the President made seven short speeches yesterday during an eight-hour journey by car from New York to northern New Jersey. In one of these speeches, the President told the people surrounding the car that his administration had built a navy capable of matching any country and an army and air force that America had only seen in peacetime.

<h3>Several Thai Aircraft Circle Over Vietnam; Franco-Thai Negotiations Make No Progress; Vietnamese Border Traffic is Blockaded</h3>
<p>Hanoi, three Thai bombers and eighteen fighter planes flew into Vietnam, circling over the airfield in Laos Province three times without dropping bombs. (29th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi, regarding the negotiations between French Vietnam and Thailand, the Thai government is currently insisting that the joint committee of both parties, in addition to handling the issue of demarcating the new border along the Mekong River, should also have the power to study Thailand's claims to the land on the right bank of the Mekong River. Therefore, the negotiations have made no progress. However, no new disputes have occurred in the border area for some time. Thailand's military deployments are still in progress, and the entire border between the country and Vietnam has been blockaded. Telegraphic communication on both sides of the Mekong River has also been interrupted in several places. At the same time, a fierce anti-French movement is underway in Thailand. Generally speaking, the situation has not deteriorated. The United States' refusal to lend money to Thailand and its ban on the export of arms to the country may have an impact on the future situation. (28th Havas dispatch)</p>

The official report stated that the Italian planes attacked the airfields of Athens and Corinth yesterday morning, with minimal damage. Three people were killed in Patras.

<p>Athens, this morning, the Greek Ministry of Public Security issued a statement stating that as a result of the Italian plane bombing of Patras, more than 100 Greek people were injured and more than 50 were killed. The reason why there were so many casualties was that the people did not go to the air raid shelters to hide, and some even climbed to the roofs to watch the air combat. In the future, it is hoped that the people will be vigilant and will not make unnecessary sacrifices. (29th Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rumor that British Troops Landed in Candia</h3>
<p>Southern Capital City, according to reliable news received here last night, British troops landed in Cephalonia, Greece, yesterday. It is reported that other British troops landed in Crete (i.e., the island of Candia), but this has not yet been confirmed.

<h3>Italian Side Declares Greece Will Be Occupied Within Three Weeks</h3>
<p>Rome, well-informed military circles here recently stated that regardless of whether Greece allows the cession of territory, Italy's occupation of Greece will be completed within three weeks. The so-called three-week period is set aside for whether Britain will implement intervention. It is also stated that if any other country in the Mediterranean, such as Turkey, rises up to fight and help Greece, Germany will immediately intervene. Whether the negotiations between Hitler and Mussolini yesterday included such an agreement is unknown, but well-informed sources believe it may have happened. However, officials here recently formally announced that the two sides' views have reached complete agreement on yesterday's Hitler-Mussolini meeting. Diplomatic circles believe that if the Italian-Greek war requires the implementation of the Tripartite Pact, then Japan will also be drawn into the war against Greece before the Italian-Greek issue reaches a peaceful resolution. The acceleration of offensives on all fronts, from the air raids on Britain to the attack on Egypt, is also recognized by diplomatic circles as continuing. Furthermore, military officials said that at dawn tomorrow, Italy's entire operational machinery, including the parachute troops, will be mobilized to occupy the Greek islands. Observers here are speculating a lot about the Hitler-Mussolini meeting. The official communique only stated that all the issues discussed at the meeting had reached a complete understanding.

<h3>Talks Between German and Italian Leaders: Full Understanding Reached on Various Issues; Roman Newspapers Claim Meeting Concerned the Future of European Politics; Hitler Left Florence for Germany That Evening</h3>
<p>After holding important talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Florence yesterday, German Führer Hitler immediately returned to his country by special train at 6 PM. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ciano also swiftly returned to Rome. (Havas News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>The official announcement from Rome stated that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini reached a full understanding on the many issues discussed during their meeting in Florence yesterday. The official announcement claimed that the Führer and the Prime Minister spoke for several hours, demonstrating the spirit and sincerity of their alliance, and fully agreed on their views on all current issues. The announcement also stated that the Foreign Ministers of Germany and Italy, Ciano and Ribbentrop, attended the meeting. Hitler and Mussolini began their talks at 11 AM and concluded at 2 PM. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>An editorial written by Baloni, editor of the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," stated that the Florence meeting was unique. Previous meetings between German and Italian leaders focused on military matters, but this time the discussions were closely related to the future of European politics. The main issue at present is the need for a clear division between the European continent and Britain. Countries leaning towards Britain should not be allowed to have a foothold on the continent. Once this "scorched earth" policy is completed, Britain will find it difficult to resist attacks from the Axis powers in the long term. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>The semi-official German "Diplomatische Korrespondenz" commented on the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, stating that nothing could prevent the realization of the Axis powers' plan to establish a united group of European countries participating in the progressive movement. The complete removal of British influence from the European continent is a necessary prelude to the reconstruction of Europe. If we find any base that could be used by Britain's dangerous institutions anywhere, it must be eradicated for the sake of Europe's interests. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>According to news from Florence, New York, Hitler and Mussolini met in Florence yesterday to discuss an agreement to reduce Italy's territorial demands on France in exchange for French warships to be used in attacks. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Regarding the meeting of Axis leaders in Florence, Berlin, German authorities announced yesterday afternoon that, following the meetings between Führer Hitler and Franco, Pétain, and Laval, Hitler's meeting with Mussolini to discuss recent developments was inevitable. The date of this meeting, occurring at a time of extreme activity for the Axis powers' military and political affairs, and also coinciding with the 18th anniversary of the Fascist Party's rule, shows its importance. Berlin did not release the content of the talks, stating that it would be published in the official gazette at a later date. Previous statements had repeatedly stated that the Axis powers' goal was to create a new cooperative Europe. The issues discussed at the Brenner Pass must have been reviewed again at this meeting. The official side called the French peace terms reported by the American press fabricated, but remained silent on the content of the Franco-German talks. Berlin officials did not comment on the Italo-Greek situation yesterday, but said that Greece's pro-British stance was intolerable. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Declares Resolve to Maintain Independence; Remains Neutral on Italo-Greek War; Turkish Military Representative Arrives in Athens</h3>
<p>Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam, in a nationwide broadcast, without directly mentioning the situation in Greece, stated that the dangers we face are increasing, but a mature and noble sense of unity is the strongest weapon to defend our security. Turkey has firm faith in its own strength and will not hesitate to defend its independence. We are now stronger and more confident than ever before. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam made a firm official indication here yesterday that Turkey will remain neutral in the Italo-Greek war. The Prime Minister hinted in his address commemorating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic that Turkey will not be involved in the current crisis. The Prime Minister did not even mention Greece in his address, but emphasized the "happiness of peace." Political observers here are awaiting Saydam's speech with keen interest, as this is the first statement by a senior Turkish government official since the invasion of Greece. It is believed that Saydam's remarks will indicate Turkey's intention to respect its mutual aid agreement with Greece, which stipulates that the two countries should help each other if either is attacked. (International Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara: The Turkish Broadcasting Station announced the news of Italy's ultimatum to Greece at 7 AM yesterday morning. News that Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas rejected the Italian ultimatum and that Italian troops had entered Greece has caused alarm in Turkey, as Turkey has obligations to Britain under the treaty. As of noon yesterday, Turkey had not shown any signs of pro-Greek intervention. Diplomatic circles here are confident that Turkey has a well-thought-out plan and will maintain a defensive position when the Italo-Greek war breaks out. It is generally expected that Turkey's attitude towards the new situation in the Balkans will soon be revealed. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Chief of Staff of British Near East Forces Arrives in Ankara</p>
<p>Ankara: General Smith, Chief of Staff of the British Near East Forces, arrived here from Cairo. Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff General Gündüz also visited Athens. This is seen here as a sign of political change. Diplomatic circles believe that Turkey will only express its attitude towards the Italo-Greek dispute after the National Day celebrations and when the situation in Greece becomes clearer. It is reported that Major General Smith's visit is a unilateral action by Britain and does not indicate a change in Turkey's attitude. According to parliamentarians, Turkey will only react when attacked. Therefore, Major General Smith's visit is merely a return visit to Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff General Gündüz's visit to Cairo a few months ago. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara: According to information received here, General Smith, Chief of Staff of the British Near East Forces, has already left for Ankara and will meet with the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Army. It is also learned that the Turkish military delegation has arrived in the capital of Greece. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>London: Britain and Turkey are currently discussing the Italo-Greek situation through normal diplomatic channels. There is no news here about Germany and the Soviet Union's current attitude. Rumors that British troops have landed in Kefalonia, Crete, and Thessaloniki are completely confirmed. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Britain and Turkey are currently discussing what position Turkey should take in the Italo-Greek war in accordance with the treaty recently signed between the two countries. Although Turkey has no obligation to help Greece, it is said that Greece deeply hopes that Turkey will rise up to help Greece when it defends its country. Therefore, it is essential for Turkey to maintain a strong position in Thrace. Greece does not need land assistance, but it needs naval assistance, but it is difficult for Turkey to provide it. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister and Turkish President Have Long Phone Conversation</h3>
<p>Athens: Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas had a 15-minute telephone conversation with Turkish President İsmet last night. The content of the conversation is kept secret. According to well-informed sources, Metaxas met with the British, Turkish, and Yugoslavian envoys yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Declares Neutrality</h3>
<p>Sofia: Political circles here declared yesterday that Bulgaria will closely monitor the Italo-Greek war but will not interfere. Since the King mentioned in Parliament yesterday that Bulgaria would maintain friendly relations with its neighbors, it is generally believed that the King's intention included Greece. However, it is difficult to say whether Bulgaria can maintain this attitude if Turkey joins the war on the British side. According to news received here, the Bulgarian-Greek border is very stable, and Bulgaria has not taken any border defense measures. However, the air route between Sofia and Athens has now been suspended. Bulgarian newspapers today carry reports on the Greek war, stating that Greece's pro-British stance has forced Italy to use force strategically. The newspapers claim that, in any case, Bulgaria will protect its independence and interests and urge the people to be more vigilant. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>German Light Bombers Raid England</h3>
<p>Berlin: German light bombers continued to raid London yesterday afternoon, dropping many bombs on railway stations and factories. They engaged in fierce battles with British fighter planes, shooting down two British planes. One German plane is missing. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>London: According to official announcements, one German bomber was destroyed on Monday night. German aircraft activity covered several areas, but London and the Midlands remained the main targets. An Air Ministry communique said that German aircraft began attacking after dusk, but the intensity subsided by this morning. Several houses, shops, and other buildings were destroyed in the London area, and several fires broke out, but they were quickly extinguished. A large number of incendiary bombs were dropped on a city in the Midlands, causing many fires, but casualties were minor. Enemy aircraft activity was also detected in the southeast and northeast of England, but damage was minor and casualties were very few. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>US Expresses Sympathy for Greece</h3>
<p>Washington: The Greek envoy to the United States visited the State Department yesterday afternoon and was received by Undersecretary of State Welles. The envoy told reporters that the King and government of Greece were doing their best to restore normalcy in the country and hoped that the United States would express sympathy for the situation in their country. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Naval Chief Announces British Navy Has Been Mobilized to Aid Greece; British King and Prime Minister Send Telegrams to Greece Guaranteeing Full Assistance</h3>
<p>London: Naval Minister Alexander announced today that British naval assistance to Greece has begun. He said, "I can assure Greece and the United States that the British Navy will do its utmost to help Greece. Mussolini's aggression against Greece is nothing less than a repeat of the attack on Britain from behind in June of this year. The British Navy has achieved great success in the Mediterranean and Red Sea in recent months, sinking a large number of enemy submarines and destroying many destroyers and cruisers." (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The British King sent a telegram to King George II of Greece and the Greek people, stating, "The current trial is very difficult, but we all accept it with a firm belief in ultimate victory. We hope that the tide will turn and the moment of the aggressor's failure is gradually approaching." (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram to Greek Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday, strongly encouraging Greece and firmly guaranteeing that Britain would be able to provide assistance. Churchill said in the telegram, "We will give you as much assistance as we can. We are fighting the same enemy and will share the victory together in the future. Italy has repeatedly threatened you without effect, so they have launched an invasion against your country on the pretext of unfounded accusations. Under your leadership, your people have recently disregarded the enemy's threats. This spirit has been envied by the enemy. I am confident that you will be able to weather the crisis with the same spirit." Diplomatic circles here have paid close attention to the situation in the Balkans in the past 24 hours, paying attention to Turkey's possible actions, according to the most well-informed sources. Turkey's current actions may only be trying to put pressure on Yugoslavia to demobilize to prevent it from joining the attack on Greece. Diplomatic observers solemnly stated last night that the Balkan Pact originally stipulated that Turkey should provide military assistance to Greece to resist an attack by Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia is a Balkan country. However, the agreement does not clearly stipulate military assistance in the event of an attack on Greece by a non-Balkan country. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The British envoy to Greece was instructed by London to clearly state to Prime Minister Metaxas that Britain will provide Greece with all possible assistance to help it resist the Italian invasion. A Reuters reporter learned from the Turkish Embassy in London that the Turkish Embassy had received information that Turkey and Italy are now in a state of war. The British are very pleased with Greece's position and will provide the fullest possible assistance in accordance with the guarantee conditions. It goes without saying that when the British Prime Minister announced this guarantee in the House of Commons last April 13, he stated that the British government regarded the non-disturbance of the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Balkans as the most important event. Before invading Greece, Italy deliberately spread rumors that groups of Greek refugees attacked Italian border outposts, causing many deaths and injuries, and that British or Greek people were trying to cause explosions at a certain port in Albania. In fact, these rumors are completely unfounded and have been firmly denied by the Greek government. Italy wants to send troops to invade Greece and break the guarantee it gave to Greece a year ago, so it first makes false accusations. This trick cannot escape the observation of the world. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Content of Italy's Ultimatum to Greece: Demands Occupation of Strategic Locations</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian envoy to Greece, Grazzi, presented a note to the Greek government at 3 AM yesterday, stating that the Italian government has repeatedly found that the attitude adopted by the Greek government in the current European war not only violates the peaceful, friendly, and good-neighborly relations between Italy and Greece, but also violates the Greek government's obligations to remain neutral. The Greek government has allowed the British fleet to use Greek territorial waters, coasts, and ports during combat, and has provided food supplies to the British Air Force, and has allowed British military intelligence personnel to operate in Greece, causing damage to Italy. The Italian government has been repeatedly forced to ask the Greek government to fulfill its obligations, and has repeatedly protested against the Greek government's measures that violate its obligations. The Greek government is well aware of this situation and has repeatedly become the subject of Italian diplomatic action. The Greek government also understands the serious consequences of its attitude and has not responded with any measures to protect its neutrality, but has instead intensified its actions, assisting the British army, and cooperating with the Italian enemy. Italy has evidence that the Greek government knows of this cooperation, and the method of cooperation is stipulated by agreements between the army, navy, and air force. The Italian government does not mention here that Greece accepted the British guarantee, and regards it as part of a plan aimed at Italian security. The Italian government only states the Greek government's clear responsibility to provide strategic locations in Greece, including airfields in Thessaly and Macedonia that can attack Albania, to countries at war with Italy. The Italian government must remind the Greek government of Greece's provocative actions against Albania, the implementation of terrorist policies against the residents of Samaria, and attempts to create unrest outside the border. Regarding this incident, the Italian government has been forced to inform the Greek government of the inevitable consequences of this anti-Italian policy. Italy can no longer tolerate it. Greece's neutrality is becoming increasingly hypocritical. The responsibility for this situation should be borne by Britain, which hopes to involve various countries in the war. The current Greek policy is tending to turn Greek territory into a base for belligerent actions against Italy, or at least has allowed this transformation. This policy will cause military conflict between Italy and Greece. Italy has tried its best to avoid military conflict. Therefore, the Italian government has decided to ask the Greek government to allow Italian troops to occupy Greek strategic locations during Italy's war against Britain, as a complete guarantee for Italy. The Italian government asks the Greek government not to oppose this occupation, and not to obstruct the troops occupying strategic locations. Italian troops are not enemies of the Greek people. The Italian government has no intention of affecting Greek sovereignty and independence with the temporary occupation of strategic locations, which is purely defensive in nature due to the needs of the situation. The Italian government asks the Greek government to immediately issue the necessary orders to the military authorities to allow Italian troops to carry out the occupation peacefully. If Italian troops encounter resistance, they will use force to break this resistance, and the Greek government should also bear the responsibility for all losses. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>

<h3>National Savings Movement; Chairman Chiang Encourages Promotion; Expanded Publicity Campaign Begins on November 10; Convenient Savings Methods for Shanghai Residents</h3>
<p>November 10th is the anniversary of the establishment of the National Thrift and National Salvation Savings Movement Committee, and it has been decided that from this day to the 16th, it will be the National Thrift and National Salvation Savings Movement Expanded Publicity Week. Chairman Chiang personally ordered his subordinates to promote thrift and national salvation savings, saying that the War of Resistance has reached its later stages, and the development of economic power is the key to victory. In order to absorb idle capital, increase production, balance commodity prices, and stabilize society, all party members, civil servants, soldiers on the front and rear lines, and people from agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia across the country should actively participate in the thrift and national salvation savings movement, purchase and deposit savings bonds, or open savings accounts with the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. Not only should they continue to do so every month, but they should also universally advise relatives and friends to actively save in order to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the goal of national construction.

<p>Promotion in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau issued thrift and national salvation savings bonds, all branches or agents of these banks and bureaus have successively issued two types: A and B. The bonds are divided into six denominations: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan.

<h3>US Naval Officers Ordered to Concentrate Residence; All Personnel Residing in French Concession Must Move Out; Families to Depart on December 3</h3>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," this morning (29th), it was learned that officers of the 4th US Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai have received orders stating that all those residing in the French Concession and other parts of the city must move into the "area" bounded by Foch Road, Jiaozhou Road, Seymour Road, and Haifang Road. It is expected that most officers of the US Marine Corps will move into the Second Battalion barracks of the US Marine Corps on Haifang Road this week.</p>
<p>New Restrictions Facilitate Assembly</p>
<p>It is also disclosed that in the future, US troops stationed in Shanghai will not be allowed to stay outside the new "area" after midnight. At the same time, it is heard that US troops stationed in Shanghai are now allowed to prepay three months' salary so that they can send it to their families in the country. It is believed that the implementation of this new restriction by the 4th Marine Regiment is aimed at making it easier to summon all officers and soldiers when necessary.</p>
<p>Family Evacuation Arrangements Completed</p>
<p>In addition, the families of US Marine Corps personnel here are expected to evacuate Shanghai entirely by mid-December. It is heard that arrangements for their evacuation have been completed. The first batch will leave Shanghai on the President Monde on December 3, and the rest will depart on the Mariposa in mid-December. According to an announcement this morning, the President Washington will arrive here on December 17 to evacuate American expatriates. The ship will remain in Shanghai until December 21, when it will set sail for Manila, where it is expected to arrive on the 23rd, and will leave on the 25th, arriving in Los Angeles on December 8.</p>
<p>Oil Tankers Sailing to Singapore Completely Baseless</p>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," rumors that the Asia Petroleum Company's oil tankers and inland river vessels currently sailing between Shanghai and North China are scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai and return to Singapore next week have been denied by a senior official of the Asia Petroleum Company. It is said that this statement is actually inaccurate. The company originally had several ships docked in this port and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Several of them were requisitioned by the British government last year.</p>
<h3>American Community Fetes Two Consuls; Farewell to the Old and Welcome the New; Acting Consul to Return to America</h3>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the new US Consul General in Shanghai, Locke Hart, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge to assume his new post the other day, while Butlerick, who has been temporarily serving as the US Consul General in Shanghai since this spring, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Pierce on Friday (December 1). The American Community Federation and the American Chamber of Commerce in this city jointly held an informal banquet in the "Golden Room" of the American Club this noon (29th) to entertain Locke and Butlerick to show their welcome and farewell. During the banquet, the President of the American Chamber of Commerce, Smith, and the Chairman of the American Community Federation, McMullen, both delivered speeches, expressing the American community's gratitude for Butlerick's service and wishing him a smooth journey. Butlerick gave a reply, saying that he was reluctant to say goodbye, but although he was leaving Shanghai, he would not forget the pleasant impressions he had gained here. Subsequently, Smith and McMullen gave speeches to welcome the new Consul General, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves and dispersed. It is reported that Locke Hart had previously been stationed in various parts of China several times.</p>
<h3>Public Rice Sale to Be Held the Day After Tomorrow; Rice Price Evaluation Temporarily Postponed Due to Current Market Price Being Lower Than Production Cost</h3>
<p>To stabilize the entire rice market in Shanghai, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its eleventh standing committee meeting at its office yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. Seventeen committee members attended, and representatives from both the foreign settlements and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were delegated to attend and provide guidance. Zhang Nianxuan was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and he reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the current market price of foreign rice has already fallen by five yuan per dan (unit of weight) compared to the production cost, seemingly making an evaluation unnecessary. However, in accordance with the wishes of the foreign settlement authorities, the price of foreign rice should also be evaluated based on production cost. Subsequently, Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Zixiang, and others stood up and made suggestions separately, and then a discussion began. The result of the discussion was that the current market price is lower than the production cost, and if the instructions of the foreign settlement authorities are followed, adding profit and loss would greatly exceed the market price. Therefore, only the current production cost and market conditions can be reported to the two settlements for their review. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Urging Orders</p>
<p>According to the Rice Price Evaluation Committee's statement yesterday, it hopes that all sectors will not stand idly by and will quickly participate in group orders of foreign rice. Although the current rice market situation in Shanghai appears to be stable on the surface, in this volatile international situation, if the source of foreign rice is interrupted, rice prices will inevitably rise again. The committee will also strongly encourage all industry members to take advantage of the current long-term foreign exchange policy and low production cost of foreign rice to place large orders to prepare for any emergency. However, the requirement that each bag requires a prepayment of forty yuan in national currency from the purchaser is felt to be burdensome given the unrecovered economic hardship of the people. It is hoped that this can be reduced or that other guarantee methods can be devised. In addition, the Ningbo Native Place Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss methods for fellow villagers to purchase rice as a group.</p>
<p>Seventh Phase of Public Rice Sale</p>
<p>The Public Rice Sale Committee issued its seventh public notice yesterday, stating: "For public notice, it is hereby announced that the seventh phase of the public rice sale will be held from November 1st, continuing the previous method. The Rice Merchants Association is still entrusted to designate sixty member rice stores in the two foreign settlements to handle the public sale, including thirty-six in the International Settlement, with eighteen selling tickets and eighteen distributing rice, and twenty-four in the French Concession, with twelve selling tickets and twelve distributing rice. The Rice Merchants Association has already designated these stores, and they will open on time. Rice purchasers must purchase rice in accordance with the regulations and must not rush or squeeze. In addition to reporting to the authorities of the two foreign settlements to instruct the police to assist in maintaining order and protecting the public, this notice is hereby given. (Names of ticket-selling and rice-distributing stores omitted.)"</p>
<h3>New Loans Released at the End of the Month: Over Ten Million Yuan; Old Customers Granted Loans Appropriately to Avoid Idle Consumption of Interest</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the last day of the month for Shanghai's industry and commerce, the only general closing period for long-term monthly settlements. It is learned that new credit loans amounted to more than 100,000 yuan, which is more than the mid-month closing in the first half of the year. This is mainly due to the sharp increase in deposits in various banks and firms, which necessitated granting appropriate loans to reliable old customers to avoid idle consumption of interest. However, most require reliable guarantors. Regarding the overall financial market, due to frequent reports of victories from the front lines, the black market foreign exchange rate for HSBC has lengthened, and the black market price of silver dollars has increased but remains stable as usual. The interbank lending rate remains at the original price of 12%, and there is no emergency in the money market. There is no problem in safely passing through the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Spying on Cao'e Intercepted; They Have Collapsed Towards Doumen; The Situation in Shaoxing and Zhuji Remains Unchanged; The Situation on the East Bank of the Cao'e River Has Become More Stable</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Association in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang yesterday: "(1) The Japanese troops who crossed Keqiao and attacked Shaoxing City are a small force of more than 100 men who sneaked into the Shaoxing urban area from the southeast suburbs. Fierce street fighting immediately broke out, and a fire broke out in the city, which lasted until the 27th and has now been extinguished. The material losses were quite significant. The Japanese troops in the city yesterday (the 20th) morning again exited the Wuyun Gate to the east, occupied Donghu Villa, and then sneaked to the Chebu Fanjiang area, causing the situation between Baiguan and Cao'e to suddenly become tense. After being intercepted by strong troops, they have collapsed towards Doumen. The situation on the east bank of the Cao'e River has stabilized. The Japanese troops within Shaoxing are exhausted and there are no drastic changes. (2) According to military news, the Japanese troops in Gaobu, east of Shaoxing, are collapsing westward towards Doumen. There are currently no unexpected drastic changes in the Zhuji area. (3) The more than 1,000 Japanese troops who are roaming on the right flank, including the more than 100 who sneaked into Shaoxing City, are trapped in a corner and are difficult to develop. (4) The number of Japanese troops invading Shaoxing is small, and large forces have arrived at the front line one after another. It will not be difficult to resolve the situation in the shortest possible time. Currently, the city's telephone lines have been interrupted, and the situation is unclear. The Chinese army is attacking in the rain."</p>
<h3>It is Rumored that the Shanghai Consular Body Will Convene a Meeting Next Week; The Vacant Position of Head Consul Will Be Appointed; This Meeting is Likely a Factor in Stabilizing Shanghai</h3>
<p>All facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement are based on the resolutions of the annual meeting of taxpayers as the warp, and the instructions of the Consular Body as the weft. It is an absolute representation of the legal interests of various countries and the highest administrative body of the municipality where taxpayers enjoy their rights. Recently, the situation in Shanghai has become tense due to the turbulence of the international crisis. Some aspects of the Municipal Council's measures cannot be compared with the past. Impartial people from all countries share this sentiment and hope that the situation can be changed as soon as possible and that the general situation in this port can be stabilized. After the diplomatic personnel of the countries concerned were transferred to Shanghai, this wish was sincerely felt. If there is a harmonious feeling in the Consular Body, the Municipal Council will naturally receive assistance and increase its administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>New American and French Consuls; Important Responsibilities</p>
<p>Recently, the consuls of the United States and France have been replaced. The new American Consul Lockhart and the French Consul General Magere have arrived in Shanghai one after another. All parties are paying close attention to the position and stance of the American Consul. There have been some unfounded rumors in the French Concession in the past few weeks. Mr. Mage, when he first arrived, should calm everything down to comfort the people's expectations. Therefore, the significance of the arrival of the two new consuls in Shanghai this time is not just a transfer of diplomatic personnel from their respective countries.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>It is now heard that the Shanghai Consular Body will convene a consular meeting next week to seek to connect the feelings between the consuls and to discuss the general situation in Shanghai. It is heard that one of the most important points is to re-elect the Head Consul, because the original Head Consul, Italian Consul Niron, has been transferred to another position. This position is still vacant. As for other matters, some discussions may also be held to adapt to the current environment in Shanghai. It is believed that this meeting is a factor in stabilizing the overall situation in Shanghai, so it is given great importance.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Songfu Died of Illness in Fenghua</h3>
<p>Zhuang Songfu, also known as Zhuang Jingzhong, was naturally gifted and physically strong. In his youth, he was a student and a farmer, offering advice. As he grew older, he absorbed new knowledge and worked for the revolution. Dr. Sun Yat-sen regarded him as a comrade, and his circle of friends expanded. He established new academic societies, associations, and bookstores (now the China Agricultural Bookstore) on Jiaotong Road in this port. In addition to writing, he served as a vanguard of the revolution with martyrs such as Chen Yingchi and Huang Yingbai. After the Xinhai Revolution, he achieved his long-cherished ambition and was appointed as the Director of Finance of Zhejiang Province and the Director of the Salt Administration Bureau, eliminating long-standing malpractices and ensuring a clean officialdom. After the success of the Northern Expedition, he served as a member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government and the Deputy Director of the Huai River Water Conservancy Commission. He was able to implement what he said and could be emulated. Even European and American experts could not challenge him. After the September 18th Incident, the project of diverting the Huai River into the sea was greatly hindered, and he began to show signs of fatigue. He traveled around eastern and western Zhejiang, and wherever he went, he did his best to promote industry, water conservancy, supervision, encouragement, and rewards. He also implicitly taught the meaning of concentrating strength. After the August 13th Incident, he returned to his hometown of Fenghua, managing the Linmu Company and living in seclusion, worrying about national affairs. His health deteriorated due to illness. Last summer, the Zhejiang Provincial Senate was established, and the central government hired him to serve as a senator, but he declined due to old age. In November of winter, it was his 80th birthday. Chairman Lin, President Chiang, Dean Kong, and others all presented plaques with inscriptions such as "Distinguished Elder of the Party and the State," "Respected for Virtue and Morality," and "Noble Character of Loshe" to show their respect. President Chiang also inscribed his residence as "Nanyang Xiaozhu". At that time, his health was already poor, and he died of illness on the 24th of this month at Qiuwo Cottage in Caocun, Fenghua, at the age of 81. A veteran and old star suddenly returned to seclusion. What a sorrow!</p>
<h3>Germany: Oil Panic; Statement by the Manager of the Dutch Oil Company</h3>
<p>A foreign businessman in this port received a letter from London yesterday from Mr. Keeslow, manager of the Royal Dutch Oil Company, stating that the biggest panic currently felt in Germany is oil. The original letter stated that if Germany launches a large-scale offensive recently, a serious oil panic will inevitably occur within six months. According to rough calculations, Germany needs 20 million tons of oil per year for small-scale military operations and to maintain civilian use in the occupied areas. However, the Axis countries, if they reorganize the inferior oil transported from Romania, can obtain 4 million tons of oil per year. German mines produce 1 million tons of oil. The total amount of synthetic products from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland is 4 million tons per year, and Estonia produces 1 million tons. The three countries of Italy, Switzerland, and France total 5 million tons. Therefore, if a large-scale general offensive is launched, Germany will still be short of 10 million tons of oil per year. As for the point of Soviet aid to Germany, even if the Soviet Union is willing to transport goods to Germany, given the current capacity of the refineries and the inconvenience of transportation, large-scale transportation may have to be delayed for several years. Currently, the Soviet Union only transports a small amount of lubricating oil, kerosene, and unrefined crude oil to Germany.</p>

<h3>The Public in Chongqing and Kunming are Not Afraid of Air Raids; Morale is High and Attitude is Calm; The Chinese Section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is Being Demolished Sequentially; American Reporter Returns to Shanghai from a Southern Tour and Talks About His Impressions of the Trip</h3>
<p>The English-language Great Evening News reported that Steel, a Far East reporter for the Chicago Daily News, recently returned to Shanghai after touring the "emergency" areas of southern China for two months. This morning (the 29th), he told reporters about the situation in Kunming, Chongqing, and the border between French Indochina, saying that although Kunming and Chongqing have suffered repeated air raids, morale is high and the public generally regards air raids as a daily occurrence, and the preventive measures are now very effective, so the number of casualties is very small.</p>
<p>Damage in Kunming Is Not Serious</p>
<p>The claim in recent telegrams to Chongqing that "Kunming was razed to the ground by a squadron of Japanese bombers on October 13" is an exaggeration. Although the damage caused by the air raid was not minor, Kunming was far from destroyed. The cultural district of the city, including Yunnan University, suffered heavy damage, but the number of military targets of importance that were destroyed was also very small. Seventeen Japanese aircraft participated in the raid and dropped more than 100 bombs, including those weighing 1,000 pounds. Steel stayed in Kunming for a week and then stayed in Chongqing for a week, encountering air raids twice. The morale of the capital was very high. The air raid alarms gave the public ample time to take cover, so the casualties were light. Steel said that during the air raids, he saw that the public showed no signs of surprise and were all calm as usual.</p>
<p>The Burma Road Cannot Be Destroyed</p>
<p>Regarding the Vietnamese border, Steel said that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which connects Lao Cai and Kunming and is about 290 miles long, is now being dismantled by Chinese technicians at a rate of one kilometer per day to prevent the Japanese army from spying on Yunnan along this line. The railway passes through mountains and forests. Once the railway is destroyed, it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese army to invade. As for the Burma Road, which runs 740 miles from Lashio to Kunming, it is not easy to destroy it and render it useless due to its location.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Still Stationed in the Capital; Shanghai Office Prepares to Move to Peiping; Archives and Documents Being Sorted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the French Embassy in China, located at No. 2 Avenue Joffre in this port, will soon move back to Beiping after receiving orders to relocate. Recently, the office staff have been actively sorting out all archives and documents in order to transport them by boat to Tianjin and then to Beiping. Apart from Ambassador Cosme's wife and two daughters who have already left Shanghai for Beiping, the date of his departure to the north is still uncertain. However, it is understood that he will leave for Beiping as soon as the preparations are completed. As for Ambassador Cosme, since leaving Shanghai and flying to Vietnam and then to Chongqing, he is currently staying in the capital, in close contact with the central authorities, and plans to become a long-term resident of Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Qian Rende and a Dancer Double Report Poisoning</h3>
<p>Qian Rende, a 28-year-old from Ningbo, lives at No. 23 Avenue Albert, French Concession, and works as a clerk at the Yongming Life Insurance Company at No. 218 North Sichuan Road. After work, he enjoys visiting dance halls. Several months ago, he fell in love with Zhang Meina (20 years old, from Ningbo), a dancer at the Lido Dance Hall, who lives at No. 35 Yongnian Lane, Route Cardinal Mercier. Subsequently, a physical relationship developed. Recently, Zhang Meina stopped dancing because she was three months pregnant, but Qian Rende also felt very sorry for Zhang and planned to marry her. Unexpectedly, Qian's wife strongly opposed it, and it could not become a reality. Qian immediately had the idea of ending his life. Yesterday afternoon at about 6:00 p.m., he went to Zhang Meina's place and took her to the Continental Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, booking room 504. After paying the room fee, they closed the door and went to bed. At about 10:00 p.m., the waiter heard moaning sounds from the room and was very surprised. He went to knock on the door, but there was no response. He found a way to pry open the door and saw the man and woman lying on the bed, their faces pale. An empty bottle of poisonous liquid was on the table, indicating that they had committed suicide by taking poison. He quickly called an ambulance to send the two to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that both of them were deeply poisoned, and there may be a danger to their lives.</p>
<h3>A Kidnapping Case Occurred on Dongyouheng Road Last Night; The Kidnapped Person Was the Owner of the Dalun Silk Weaving Factory; The Carjacking Case Seems to Be Related to the Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Gu Jinhui, also known as Hongpei, a 50-year-old from Suzhou, founded the Dalun Silk Weaving Factory at No. 79, Lane 1143 (i.e., Rongchang Lane), Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. Gu and his family lived upstairs in the factory. Yesterday at about 7:00 p.m., suddenly</p>
<p>Eight kidnappers broke into the factory. Six of the kidnappers were wearing suits, and two were wearing blue cloth short shirts. They took out guns and threatened the factory staff, prohibiting them from making any noise. The kidnappers went upstairs and ran into Gu's bedroom. Without asking any questions, they forced Gu out of the room. Gu resisted slightly, and the kidnappers</p>
<p>Threatened him with a gun, and Gu did not dare to disobey and had to let the kidnappers take him downstairs and out. When they reached the alley entrance, the kidnappers pushed him into a taxi that was parked on the side of the road (number unknown). The kidnappers also boarded the car one after another, and one of them drove away at full speed. Afterwards, the family reported to the police station in charge, and they sent detectives to investigate. It is heard that about an hour before the case occurred, a Ningbo Road Meihua Motor Company</p>
<p>A taxi (No. 17820) was passing through the intersection of Zhoujiazui Road and Baoding Road in Hongkou when three bandits suddenly used guns to force the driver Zhang Baosheng to stop. Zhang had no choice but to stop. After the three bandits got into the car, one of them drove away. As of midnight last night, the driver and the car had not been found. As for whether the car used by the kidnappers was the car that the three bandits had carjacked, it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>The 240,000 Yuan Leather Clothing Case; Witnesses Were Interrogated Yesterday; The Situation is Complex and Detailed Inquiries Lasted One Hour; The Court Ordered Further Investigation and Rescheduled the Hearing</h3>
<p>Zhou Meiyihui (57 years old this year), a wealthy widow from Jiangxi who lives at No. 20, Lane 1400, Avenue Haig, Public Concession, was recently sued by Zhou Pengling (22 years old this year), the cousin of her deceased husband Zhou Zishan, through lawyer Shan Yuhua, to the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a judgment to return 23 boxes of leather clothing worth 240,000 yuan in national currency. Judge Guo has summoned her several times, and because the case is complex and important, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled</p>
<p>Call Witnesses for Questioning</p>
<p>Judge Guo opened the Civil Division Two courtroom again yesterday afternoon to hear the case. Shan Yuhua, the lawyer representing the plaintiff Zhou Pengling, first presented the ledger of the leather boxes stored at the defendant Zhou Mei's house. Judge Guo immediately questioned the witness Peng Boqian based on this. He asked if the ledger was recorded by them at the beginning. Peng read it for a long time and testified to the court that it was written by the witness and Zhou. According to Zhou Weibin, who also testified, he had written a letter at the instruction of lawyer Peng</p>
<p>Explain in the Letter</p>
<p>The method of resolving the leather clothing worth 20,000 yuan stored at Zhou Zishan's place, but he did not know how many boxes or how many pieces of leather clothing it referred to, because the witness was in a very bad situation at the time, his house was sealed, and he was mentally confused. The court then asked the defendant Zhou Mei how many boxes the plaintiff had actually stored at her place. According to Zhou Mei's lawyer, there were actually 39 boxes, excluding 18 boxes of leather clothing as collateral for Zhou Zishan's debt of more than 23,000 taels to the Yu Da Money Shop on behalf of the plaintiff's deceased father in 1927. The plaintiff took away 13 boxes</p>
<p>Auctioned Eight Boxes</p>
<p>The plaintiff himself and the lawyer then said to the court that there were actually 23 boxes of leather clothing stored at the defendant's place. The defendant said that there were only 18 boxes of leather clothing, which was inconsistent. The plaintiff's claim that he took 43 boxes and auctioned 8 boxes were not within the original 39 boxes stored at the defendant's place. The items originally stored at the defendant's place were all recorded in the ledger that the presiding judge just gave to the witness Peng Boqian and was proven to be written by Peng et al. There are lot numbers to check. According to the representative of Tian Yushu, the manager of Yu Da Money Shop, who brought the ledger from 1927</p>
<p>Testified to the Court</p>
<p>Zhou Zishan had repaid more than 30,000 yuan that year. The plaintiff's lawyer said to the court that the records in the ledger were inconsistent with Zhou Zishan's current account and could not prove that Zhou Zishan had repaid the debt on behalf of the plaintiff's deceased father. Moreover, according to Zhou Zishan's current account, the plaintiff had paid Zhou Zishan several payments in 1927. The court checked the statements, and because the interrogation had lasted for an hour and there were still things to be investigated, it was ruled that the hearing would be rescheduled to November 9.</p>
<h3>Several Thousand Barber Shops in the City Plan to Form a Cooperative</h3>
<p>There are thousands of barber shops in this city, employing 40,000 barbers. The industry consumes the most cosmetics because it serves modern women for haircuts and makeovers. Over the years, it has amounted to millions. Most of the cosmetics used, such as perfume, soap, and hair oil, are imported. Over time, the benefits are increasingly flowing abroad, which has a significant impact on the national economy. It is now learned that enthusiastic people in the industry have initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative to save on expenses and recover benefits. They also plan to raise shares to establish a factory to manufacture various cosmetics themselves. Representatives of the industry, Chen Yongting, Zhu Mingqing, and dozens of others, held a dinner at the Lao Ban Zhai Restaurant last night. Many supporters from all walks of life also attended. During the dinner, Zhu Mingqing reported on the significance of organizing the barber industry consumer cooperative. Chen Yongting, Chen Defu, Jin Zhibao, Jin Wanquan, Wang Chunbo, Liu Shunlin, Wang Yongcai, Lu Yukuan, Hua Defu, Du Defa, Xu Dengxiang, Zhu Yucheng, Chen Yongyuan, and others discussed the results and decided to formally establish a preparatory committee for the consumer cooperative. The issue of establishing a factory to manufacture cosmetics themselves was also decided to be actively pursued, and Sun Ren, a chemical engineer who studied in Germany, was hired to oversee everything.</p>
<h3>The Man Shot Was Actually a Bandit; The Wuweizhai Robbery Was Solved; The Police Department Is Investigating the Remaining Gang Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at about 1:00 p.m. yesterday (the 28th), a man suddenly arrived at the Sanmin Hospital at the intersection of North Henan Road and Tiantong Road, seeking treatment for a gunshot wound. The person was either Japanese or Korean and spoke poor Shanghai dialect, asking the doctor not to report to the police. However, the doctor refused and confined him to a room. When the detectives from Huizi Police Station</p>
<p>Arrived after receiving the report and investigated, they immediately determined that the person was a bandit who, on the night of the 27th of this month, along with an accomplice, broke into the Wuweizhai Restaurant at No. 76 Jing'an Temple Road with weapons, robbed it of 500 yuan, and escaped. During the escape, he was shot and wounded by a Chinese policeman but still managed to escape in a rickshaw. His accomplice also escaped without a trace. After Huizi Police Station detectives apprehended the suspect, they notified the Japanese Consulate Police Department and took the suspect away. It is heard that he has been sent to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. Late yesterday night,</p>
<p>The police claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and the Japanese Consulate Police Department are still investigating the case. It was found that during the Wuweizhai robbery on the night of the 27th, the Chinese policeman fired three shots at the bandits, and the arrested suspect had three bullet wounds, which confirmed that the suspect was the bandit who was injured and escaped in the robbery. It is heard that the suspect was injured in the face, right arm, and chest, but the injuries were not serious. After the robbery, he managed to escape the police dragnet and barely spent the night. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>He went to two Japanese doctors in Hongkou to seek treatment, but fled in panic because the doctors reported to the police. At 1:15 p.m., he turned to Sanmin Hospital and finally fell into the police dragnet. It is heard that the suspect claimed that he was shot in the Xujiahui area of western Shanghai on the night of the 27th.</p>
<h3>Theft of Introduction Letter, Impersonating for Job, Embezzlement of Public Funds Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>A certain Ye Dingyuan, who previously worked at the Hading (transliteration) Company at 121 Beijing Road for several years, resigned this year. Later, his nephew, Chen Jiqi (also known as Chen Dexian), knew that his uncle was highly trusted by the foreign manager of the company. He seized the opportunity to obtain a letter of recommendation for a job change from the foreign firm's manager. He then impersonated his uncle's name and went to the Maerkang Company at 220 Sichuan Road to seek employment. The company, seeing the letter of introduction from the Hading Company, hired him. For several months, everything went smoothly. However, on the 30th of last month, the manager of Maerkang Company gave Chen a check from the Chen Zongyuan Bank for 6,000 yuan, instructing him to cash it. Unexpectedly, after cashing the check, Chen embezzled the funds and fled without a trace. The company reported this to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese Detective Feng Qishan, it was discovered that Chen had used the name Ye Dingyuan. Therefore, they sought out Ye, but after investigation, Ye denied ever working for Maerkang Company. After further investigation, the truth was revealed. Chen was apprehended yesterday at 32 Hengchang Lane, Beile Road, at the residence of his fiancée, Sun Peifang. It was discovered that after embezzling the funds, Chen deposited them in the Siming and China Banks but had spent 650 yuan, claiming it was lost in gambling dens in West Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The Patrol Room's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested that the hearing be postponed because the investigation was not yet complete. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he was ordered to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>University of Hong Kong Graduates Who Pass the Entrance Examination Are Allowed to Enter Chinese Universities as Regular Students</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The University of Hong Kong, in order to promote Sino-British cultural exchange and benefit students from mainland China, established several scholarships for Chinese students starting last year. Currently, there are two students studying at the university who were selected and sent by the Ministry of Education of the Chinese National Government. To reciprocate the University of Hong Kong's generosity in treating Chinese students, the Ministry of Education previously stipulated that graduates of English colleges in Hong Kong could not apply to national universities or independent colleges in China as regular students, but could only apply with equivalent academic qualifications (the number of places for those applying with equivalent academic qualifications accounted for only 5% of the total number of regular students). Now, it is permitted that anyone who has completed the first class of English colleges in Hong Kong and passed the University of Hong Kong entrance examination will be specially allowed to apply to public and private universities and independent colleges in China as regular students to show preferential treatment. Furthermore, at the request of the Chinese government, the university has sent six graduates from the Department of Civil Engineering, three graduates from the Department of Electrical Engineering, and one graduate from the Department of Mechanical Engineering to serve in the rear areas of southwest China. In addition, there are three graduates from various departments who are serving in the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives in Guangxi. It is believed that Sino-British friendship will become closer due to cultural exchange and academic relations.</p>

<h3>Finance: Selling Pressure on Foreign Exchange Eases by Noon, Subsequent Market Situation Turns Tense Again</h3>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listed British exchange rate increased by 125, changing to a suspension of 3 points and 8125. The US exchange rate was listed at 5.875 yuan, with a decrease of 25 points. Other exchange rates, such as Dutch, Russian, and Japanese, unanimously increased. As for the domestic market situation, it suddenly tightened. There was no stimulus in the environment, and foreign banks such as British and American banks had very strong appetites. Although speculators sold heavily, they were able to cope with ease. At the beginning of the morning, the US exchange rate was the loosest, with transactions at 6 yuan and 25 first calls. By noon, it turned weak. Sasseon and others also pulled up, and the trend went from tight to flat. As a result, British gold closed at 3 points and 90625, and the US exchange rate closed at 6 yuan and 03125, which was tighter by 0625 and 125 compared to the previous day's British and American exchange rates, respectively.</p>
<p>British Gold Traded at Four Points</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large orders, both near-term and far-term, fell by 0625. New York's silver price remained flat. London's raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British to US remained unchanged, while the British to Shanghai increased by 0625. The US to British increased by 75, the US to Shanghai increased by 18 points, and there was no market for the US to France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling price in the morning was 3 points and 96875 for British gold and 6 yuan and 15625 for the US exchange rate. Compared to the previous day's closing, there was no change in the British and American exchange rates. After opening, Huaxing first released this month's first calls, and foreign banks received 4 points. Speculators followed and sold, and the US exchange rate for October sold to foreign banks reached 6 yuan and 21875. HSBC announced the listed exchange rate, with the British exchange rate increasing by 125 and the US exchange rate firming by 25. Other exchange rates also unanimously increased. The silver balance tax was announced, decreasing by 0.25. Afterwards, Huaxing and speculators continued to release orders, but HSBC, American banks, and other foreign banks had good appetites, so the easing trend was blocked. HSBC entered the October US exchange rate of Huaxing at 6 yuan and 1875. Later, domestic speculators sold heavily, and the funds were abundant for a time, causing the October US exchange rate to drop to 6 yuan and 5. By noon, the selling pressure eased slightly, and Japanese banks, Huaxing, and British and American banks were all eager to buy. The price rebounded and tightened. Japanese banks entered the next month's US exchange rate of foreign banks at 6 yuan and 0625. The afternoon closing was 3 points and 90625 for British gold and 6 yuan and 03125 for the US exchange rate, which was softer by 0625 and tighter by 125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Sasseon Had Purchases in the Afternoon Market</p>
<p>Sasseon also came to purchase in the afternoon market. The market initially weakened, with the November US exchange rate priced at 6 yuan. Later, it rebounded slightly. Speculators sold the same month's US exchange rate to foreign banks for 6 yuan and 03125. There was little change before the evening closing. As a result, British gold closed at 3 points and 90625 and the US exchange rate closed at 6 yuan and 03125. The current month's rate was the same as the spot price, tighter by 0625 and down by 125 compared to the previous day's British gold and US exchange rate, respectively.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's US Exchange Rate Slightly Decreased</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 29th (Monday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. There were no gains or losses in the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates.

<h3>Various Parties Resume Searching, Cooked Gold Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cooked gold dark market rebounded and increased. The highest price once reached the 5,600 yuan mark. The foreign exchange rate went from easing to tightening, and people's confidence turned strong. Securities firms and a certain bank were vigorously searching for purchases in the morning, gradually raising prices from low levels. Securities firms and gold shops in the afternoon market also tended to buy. Although bullish banks closed at high levels, the result still closed at 5,520 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume for the whole day was still strong, at more than 2,000 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops increased by 10 yuan, while Guan Yu and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Cooked Gold Increases by One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, people's confidence was still strong, and the price was stable. Gold shops entered 10 taels of silver from banks at 5,420 yuan, opening higher by 20 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Later, money changers sold 20 taels to gold shops for 5,410 yuan. Before long, money changers and securities firms vigorously purchased more than 100 taels, and the price immediately rose. Securities firms entered 10 taels from gold shops for 5,470 yuan. Afterwards, due to the easing and firming of the foreign exchange rate, both banks and gold shops sold, falling to 5,415 yuan. However, a certain bank continued to search for purchases at low levels, so the price rebounded. Gold shops entered 20 taels of silver from banks, once seeing a top price of 5,570 yuan. Also, banks sold 10 taels to gold shops, rebounding to 5,525 yuan. As a result, banks traded 20 taels for 5,510 yuan, making the noon closing price. In the afternoon market, banks and money changers vigorously entered. The banks opened the market by entering 10 taels of gold from gold shops, reporting 5,540 yuan. Shortly after, the banks released 20 taels from securities firms for 5,515 yuan. At this time, gold shops and securities firms had a strong intention to enter, pulling up dozens of yuan. Banks traded 10 taels for 5,550 yuan. However, because bullish banks were eager to close at high levels, the price was lowered again. Gold shops released 10 taels to banks for 5,490 yuan, while banks traded 20 taels again, reporting 5,520 yuan, making the evening closing price, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 160 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current brand gold in cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher than cooked gold, and the closing price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 560 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both rarely opened for trading.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Ornaments in Silver Shops Also Increased</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops increased by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, and there was no change after that. Datonghang was priced at 570 yuan. The prices of Xintonghang were similar to the above price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yen Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the market price of cooked gold rose sharply and quickly, and the prices of British and American gold pounds also rebounded by 3 yuan uniformly. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged. The price of American gold notes initially continued to fall from the downward trend of the previous day, once falling to 15 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen. Afterwards, because HSBC and British and American banks had a good appetite for the black market US exchange rate, people's confidence turned stable. The needs of various parties turned strong, and the market price rose step by step, once rising to 15 yuan, 9 jiao, and 2 fen, but finally fell slightly to 15 yuan, 8 jiao, which was a rebound of 3 jiao compared to the previous day. The price of Hong Kong notes continued to fall due to the abundant supply, and the evening market fell to 3 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen, a further decrease of 6 fen compared to the previous day. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both rose sharply again and again because there were not many in circulation, and speculators were making trouble from it. The former was as high as 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen, and the latter rose to 1 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen.</p>
<p>Qianzhuang Reserve Also Reduces Interest Rate</p>
<p>The Qianzhuang United Reserve of this city sent a letter to all member qianzhuang yesterday, stating that it would reduce the interest rate on check deposits by 1 li from November 1st, that is, from November 1st, the check deposits deposited by each qianzhuang in the Reserve will be calculated at an annual interest rate of 2%.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Decrease Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-cleared bills was still decreasing. The discount rate for each 1,000 yuan was still 8 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen for the initial discount, and 9 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen for the outgoing discount. In the afternoon, it decreased to 9 yuan, and the discount approval was only 8 yuan, which was 2 jiao and 5 fen smaller than the previous day. The interest rate for the Qianye Association remained unchanged, and the morning and afternoon markets were both priced at 1 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Grains: Over 80,000 Bags Arriving Today; Foreign Rice from Saigon Reaches Shanghai; Buyers Hesitant, Market Price Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Today, a large quantity of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, transported directly from Saigon by the French company D'Orient's mail ship, totaling 8,000 tons, equivalent to over 80,000 bags. It is expected to arrive at the port today and berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Orders for foreign rice flooded in. Although powerful major players intended to support the market, ultimately supply exceeded demand, confidence weakened, and speculative traders competed to sell, causing the market to gradually decline. Yinghua Company, dealing in reimported rice, initially quoted 73 yuan when the exchange rate retracted, but with limited buying and heavy selling, the actual transaction price in the afternoon was only 71 yuan. Original bagged rice initially opened at 73.7 yuan, but later buyers only offered 72 yuan. The market appeared tired and listless, suggesting a possible further decline. Moreover, most of the recent orders, totaling over 100,000 bags, will arrive in port soon. Therefore, the market and investor sentiment currently lack any expectation of a turnaround. Spot transactions were less than 5,000 bags, and original bagged rice was only a few dozen tons. As a result of spot trading, all prices fell by about one yuan. Grade One new Saigon rice opened at 66 to 65.5 yuan; Grade Two, 61 to 60.5 yuan; and premium grade machine-milled rice opened at 64.7 to 64 yuan. However, rice from the central region (Zhongguan) was abundant in the market, leading to intense competition and the steepest price drops, from 61-62 yuan to 59 yuan. Grade Two Siam rice was 60 to 58.5 yuan, small-milled rice 59 yuan, and broken rice 55 to 54 yuan. Broken tip rice ranged from 52 yuan down to 49.5 yuan, while Wuhu broken tip rice was 58.4 yuan to 58 yuan, appearing slightly more resilient than foreign broken tip rice.</p>
<p>New early rice and kiln-grown wild rice totaled 13,000 piculs. Shops on this street, seeing the decline in foreign rice, also reduced their appetite. As a result, sellers were more willing to sell, and new early rice and kiln-grown rice fell by one yuan. New early rice was quoted at 71.5 to 71 yuan, and Qingjiao kiln-grown rice at 70 to 73.2 yuan. Yishi Xing wild rice, due to its scarcity, remained relatively firm, holding steady without change; wild rice remained at 79 yuan, down to 77.8 yuan, with Yishi Xing at 75 yuan. Du foreign tip rice lacked both success and failure; Du tip rice by the picul opened at 66.5 yuan, falling to 63.8 yuan. Sheep tip rice by the picul opened at 66 yuan, usually opening at 85 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice vendors have become sluggish, and the congee rice stall sales have also slowed. As a result, the market color has also softened. Yi-brand goods opened at 76 yuan, Changdan goods at 74.8 to 74 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan at 71-72 yuan, down to 68-69 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Supply Gradually Increases; Market Eases</h3>
<p>The current flour market is dull and unremarkable. Since the recent easing of rice prices, actual sales of flour on this street have not been as active as before. Moreover, the supply from various mills has been increasing frequently, presenting a situation of oversupply. Reimported Lao Che Pai brand flour has been selling off, but buyers are waiting and watching. It is heard that it has already fallen to 18.8 yuan, and shops on this street have made some purchases. The situation for foreign flour is frequently softening because pre-orders will arrive at the beginning of the month, and the end of the month is approaching, so sellers are eager to sell. It is heard that Gao Pai Rising Sun brand foreign flour is only selling for 19.5 yuan, and Double Eagle brand has already fallen below the 19-yuan mark, with few transactions. Hua flour mills are still pricing at 17 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags released by the two mills.</p>
<p>The wheat market is increasingly stagnant. This is because the supply has been scarce for a long time, and occasional sporadic arrivals are extremely rare. Furthermore, most of the supply is directly delivered to Japanese mills, and prices are also unchanged. As for market supply, it remains lacking. The Hua mills and the inland export market are also quiet, and the market remains as dull as ever.</p>
<h3>Securities, Domestic Bonds, and Foreign Stocks All See Declines</h3>
<p>The after-hours market for securities saw its scope of fluctuation gradually widen yesterday. Spot goods in the financial sector continued to flow out, and long positions gradually emerged, causing market prices to become unsustainable. Both Class C and Class E bonds broke through the 9-yuan barrier and reached a recent low of 8.5 yuan. The morning opened steady, with Shunchang Xinfu making some purchases, raising prices by two or three jiao, but then Jiufeng Hongda sold heavily, ultimately falling back two or three jiao. Morning closing prices were mixed, with minimal fluctuations. In the afternoon, Yuxing sold off another large batch, and Tongkang bulls gradually emerged. Lianyi Hongda also released some positions. Jiufeng Yichang and Le Mao also made some sales. Although Dingkang Lianli and Shengchang bought a lot, they ultimately failed to maintain the price, and Class C and Class E bonds quickly broke through the 9-yuan mark and reached 8.5 yuan. Later, retail investors bought, and the price recovered slightly by one or two jiao. The market sentiment has declined and is difficult to stabilize temporarily. As a result of market prices, except for Class D bonds, which did not trade all day, all others uniformly fell by 5.5 to 9 jiao. The transaction volume was around one million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 67.75  67.20 67.20 Down 0.80</p>
<p>Unified B 61.90  61.30 61.30 Down 0.51</p>
<p>Unified C 59.75  58.50 58.75 Down 0.70</p>

<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Cheng Wenren Yuan Real Estate Company were traded at a price of 25 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the public stock market seemed to have a general upward trend. Jardine Matheson first showed an increase, believing that its dividend would be announced immediately. The morning closing price even rose to a high of 91 yuan. In the afternoon, the company officially announced a dividend of 5 yuan, but the public seemed disappointed with this amount, and the price then gradually fell to a closing price of 85.5 yuan. The remaining stocks that had risen in the morning also fell back at this point. Only Jardine Brewery shares were able to maintain their strong position despite heavy pressure. Rubber shares remained overlooked, as the trading volume of industrial shares was extremely large.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British commercial companies' stocks remained flat, with no changes in the market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Short Selling of Cotton Yarn Becomes More Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising for consecutive days, plummeted by 100 yuan in these four days. This kind of reactionary decline was also reasonable. However, such large ups and downs make people fearful. In reality, prices have entered a high level, making them prone to changes. Coupled with the fact that current sales have slowed slightly, and the long-term wind of foreign exchange has become stronger, those who purchased at high prices are uneasy, and liquidations have become active, causing the market to quickly decline. According to the market, General cotton has arrived in Shanghai in thousands of bags, and therefore, short sellers are very active in the forward market, making the market even weaker.</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the yarn market, due to the rumors from the previous day that people were anxious and rumors were all negative, there were more sellers in the market. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1215 yuan. The selling frenzy was so strong that it fell directly to 1202 yuan. Upon seeing the low price, those who had sold short the previous day quickly covered their positions, and it rebounded to 1214 yuan. At this time, the opening of foreign exchange saw further lengthening, and the selling frenzy resumed, returning to 1203 yuan. After a slight correction, it was heard that the market at the exchange was trending upward, and the exchange rate changed and contracted, causing the market to gradually turn around, rising to 1227 yuan. The closing price slightly returned to a flat level, at 1223 yuan. It was found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 7770 bags, and the market for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 17 yuan. Xinsheng Factory opened 200 bags of 40-count Golden Tiger yarn at a price of 1470 yuan, 300 bags of 20-count Golden Tiger yarn at a price of 1150 yuan, and 200 bags of 18-count Golden Tiger yarn at a price of 1030 yuan. It was found that 75 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today, and another 40 pieces were shipped to Siam. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 540  Same Trade 6,500</p>
<p>Inland 730  Total 7,770</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The current cotton trading has become quiet. This is because the sharp decline in the yarn market has slightly stimulated raw cotton, so the market is showing weakness, and transactions are particularly scarce.</p>
<p>Changyinsha 240.00 Defeng 200 bags</p>
<p>Huoji flower 324.00 Defeng bought 236 bags</p>
<p>Dazhongji 243.00  Shenghuai 20 pieces</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, the market is quiet, because of the lack of important buyers, and later because of the sale of overseas cotton merchants, the result was a closing price lower than the previous day by 4-5 pounds. Yesterday, India's cotton market, including forecasts, did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading, recently because the exchange rate is long and loose, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude, but the market's inventory is not abundant, so market prices have never been able to turn cheap. The mentality among the same trade remains exceptionally firm.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was slack yesterday. Because the yarn price fell sharply and then slightly rebounded, people were uneasy. National cloth sales were relatively stable. Speculative hoarding tended toward selling, and the end of the month had arrived, so retail investors also sold off. However, buyers were watching and only made scattered spot purchases with slight transactions. The selling price of a portion of fine cloth and colored cloth continued to fall by 2.5 jiao per piece, and coarse cloth fell by 1 to 2.5 jiao. Factory disks and large hoarded goods are still insisting on not releasing. On this street, more than 300 pieces of grey cloth, bleached dyed, and printed cloth were traded. The Wenzhou gang bought more than 200 pieces of coarse and fine cloth and serge. The Fujian gang bought nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth and colored twill. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs bought more than 200 pieces of colored cloth. The North Road Yanjin gang bought more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, coarse cloth, and flannel.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth yesterday, because actual sales on this street were good, and the same trade was bullish, white fine cloth and fine twill rebounded by 5-6 jiao per piece. The majority of transactions in the market were mid-range fine cloths, with 600-700 pieces traded. Longtou serge turned silent, which is sufficient to show that the actual demand for dyed blanks is not small. At closing, Longtou fine cloth sold for 37.2 jiao, and Sijunzi serge for 1.1475 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 25 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Rangoon, 380 pieces to Hong Kong, 7 pieces to Little Luzon, 115 pieces to Siam, and 75 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes: Oil Market Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market was still lacking bullish sentiment. Although certificates for moving out stock are still being issued, the outlets are narrow, making it difficult to arouse interest. Moreover, both arrivals and inventory are thick, and the number of futures contracts is gradually increasing, so its market sentiment is in a slump. Four traders appear calm on the surface, but are quite frustrated at heart. The total market opened with 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at a price of 75 yuan, 200 pieces of Dayou Factory soybean oil at a price of 85 yuan and 84.25 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at a price of 69.5 yuan to 68.5 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil at a price of 69 yuan. Qingdao raw oil for November delivery opened at 250 barrels at a price of 98 yuan to 96.5 jiao, 350 barrels for late November delivery at a price of 99 yuan to 97.25 jiao, and called for 800 barrels for late December delivery at a price of 100 yuan to 99 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, 610 units of soybeans arrived from Tianjin yesterday, and 184 pieces of tung oil arrived. Miscellaneous grains exported included 200 bags of soybeans, shipped to Hong Kong on the 30th, 600 bags to Singapore, and 250 bags to Little Luzon. There were also 150 pieces of sesame oil and 1,000 cans of butter shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>City Sugar: Foreign Sugar Trading Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, apart from Lai Chang and the Association, seemed to be at a standstill. Only Taikoo Cube White B Mark East Pier was priced at 70 yuan, West Pier at 70 yuan and 5 jiao, totaling a small 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Dutch Red Spot was at 54 yuan, and goods en route for November 18th, with orders placed, were at 54 yuan and 4 jiao, a small 6 jiao. Market Price: Tuesday, October 29th, Year 29. Financial.</p>

<h3>Regarding "Reconstructing Morality"</h3>
<p>— Lu Yang</p>
<p>After I published an appeal to medical workers in this newspaper on the first of this month, I received a letter from reader Mr. Wang through the editor, who, in addition to sympathizing with the appeal, said that in the process of social morality's decay, we should advocate "reconstructing morality." The meaning of "reconstructing morality" is that each of us makes a new resolution, advocates a new life, a life based on the principles of honesty, purity, selflessness, and universal love, a life managed by God, to save today's moral decline." Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for advocating morality, and his ability to address the superficiality and selfishness of most people by advocating the above virtues, is indeed something I admire. However, when I wrote the previous article, I did not really expect it to make much of a contribution to reality. I only hoped to promote social awareness of this issue. This is not self-deprecation. In fact, I understand very well that the negligence or even discrimination of medical workers towards ordinary patients has its complex reasons, and it is not just a matter of "morality"!</p>
<p>Undeniably, so-called morality is just one of the society's ideologies, and the ideology of a certain society is determined by the economic organization of that society; in other words, the economy is the lower foundation of a society, and politics, law, religion, morality, art, etc. are its superstructure. Therefore, if we only try to improve the morality of this society by reconstructing morality, that is possible, but if we say that we want to fundamentally improve the moral system of this society, then it will disappoint us! Just imagine, with rice prices so high recently, can we make a rice weevil reflect on moral issues and give all the rice it has hoarded to starving people? That is simply unimaginable! He is free from the law, but a person who steals a handful of white rice from a hoarder's rice cart is qualified to be dragged to prison with a crime on his back. This is the morality of this society. What is there to say? The other day, Mr. Shi explicitly pointed out in this newspaper in an article starting from the overcrowding of prisons that too many of those lawbreaking prisoners are driven by the needs of life, because the society cannot solve their living problems, which leads to their taking risks. How can that be just a matter of "morality"!</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that if we want to advocate true morality, then instead of taking reconstructing morality as a means of improvement, we should prioritize finding out the basic reasons that cause the current moral decline and working hard to rationalize it.</p>
<h3>Difficult, Signing, and the Doctor's Responsibility</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>On October 4th, I read Ms. Lu Yang's article "Perform Our Task with the Highest Degree of Vigilance" in your publication. It moved me to tears. I recalled the tragic death of my late wife during childbirth. "Was it the doctor's negligence? Or was it caused by the disease?" The flashing of the circumstances makes me feel infinitely sad. Here is a detailed description of the process. I earnestly hope that you will disclose it so that doctors and husbands will pay more attention to the ladies.</p>
<p>My late wife was very healthy before giving birth and had been examined before and during admission to the hospital. When she was about to give birth, the doctor did not give any reports. After a few hours, I personally went to the hospital to visit. I was told that she had not yet given birth. I requested to see the pregnant woman, and she was in the waiting room. I was originally allowed to enter, but I had no choice but to go home disappointed and wait for good news. Less than two hours after I arrived home, a messenger came from the hospital and summoned me to the hospital quickly. I thought that she had already given birth. When I arrived at the hospital, who knew that my poor wife was wrapped in gauze in the morgue and had said goodbye to me forever. At that time, I was so grief-stricken that I almost passed out. I hurriedly asked how she died. They replied that it was due to difficult labor and heart disease. I asked why the examination before birth did not report heart disease. Furthermore, why did they not seek the consent and signature of family members before performing the surgery? The answers given were evasive. Because I believed in the large scale of the hospital and the high level of skill of the doctors, and because of financial reasons, I had to admit my bad luck and just grieve.</p>
<p>After reading Ms. Lu Yang's article, I suddenly realized that the indifferent attitude of some doctors and midwives in the hospital, and their failure to take full responsibility, etc., must have caused my wife's death due to negligence and dereliction of duty. Although I don't know the cause of Mrs. Li's death, I suppose it must be one of them.</p>
<p>I have a few questions below, and I pray that people in the community will review them.</p>
<p>(1) Is it very dangerous for a pregnant woman with heart disease during childbirth? If the pregnant woman had been examined by a doctor when she arrived at the hospital and found to have no heart disease, could she suddenly develop heart disease a few hours before giving birth?</p>
<p>(2) Is this type of heart disease harmful to life?</p>
<p>(3) When a doctor knows that a pregnant woman has heart disease, does he usually save the adult or protect the baby?</p>
<p>(4) Does the hospital have regulations that family members must sign before performing surgery for difficult labor? However, if the doctor has already examined the patient and filled out a form one month before delivery and at the time of delivery, proving that there will be no difficult labor, and there are no other changes at the time of delivery, can it suddenly become difficult labor?</p>
<p>(5) In the above situation, does the doctor need to seek the consent and signature of the family before performing surgery?</p>
<p>(6) If the family has not signed, and the hospital performs the surgery, resulting in an accident, is the hospital and the doctor fully responsible? Chen Lian bows respectfully</p>
<p>Huo Sang Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Women's Dormitory</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>The Shoes Problem</p>
<p>Huo Sang was also walking east, and had stopped at the corner of Datong Road. Lao Mao was also standing next to him. I rushed over to take a look. Lying on the ground was a person, it was that old man Li Zhiban!</p>
<p>At this time, none of us spoke. I looked at Li Zhiban on the ground. His body was curled up and lying on his side on the ground. He was still wearing that dark blue wrinkled silk camel hair robe, and a pair of black satin shoes with double beam cloth soles on his feet. His eyes were closed tightly, and his lips were open, panting there. I knew that he had been shot, but I didn't know where. Huo Sang had already squatted down and used his hand to unbutton the old man's chest. Only then did I see that there was a bright red blood stain on the right chest of the shirt inside.</p>
<p>Huo Sang tilted his head and said to me, "Bao Lang, quickly make a phone call to the police department and tell them to send an ambulance."</p>
<p>I immediately turned around and ran into the doorway. Jin Mei was stunned inside the iron gate. I pushed away and rushed into the house, stepping up the stairs three steps at a time. At the turn of the stairs, I dialed the number of the telephone. The call went very smoothly, and it took only a minute or two. Ni Jinshou was still in the hall. This news was of course unexpected to him. He promised to come right away.</p>
<p>When I returned to the corner outside, Huo Sang had straightened up and was putting a few pieces of paper, which seemed to have been searched from Li Zhiban's body, into his own pocket. His expression was of course very nervous, but not flustered. Lao Mao was still standing next to him, and the flustered expression was taken care of by him alone. I told Huo Sang that Ni Jinshou was coming right away. Huo Sang just nodded. He also looked at the opposite side of the street and both ends, and spoke to Lao Mao.</p>
<p>"You came out before me, did you see anything?"</p>
<p>Lao Mao opened his small eyes and nodded, saying, "I saw him - I saw Zhao Boxiong, surnamed Zhao."</p>
<p>Huo Sang didn't answer, nor did he look particularly surprised, but he closed his mouth tightly, as if thinking about something.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but say, "Oh my, it's this guy again! So powerful!" Huo Sang didn't answer, and said to Lao Mao, "Could you have seen it wrong?" Lao Mao shook his head and said, "No, when I ran to the corner of the road, I saw two people running north and one person running south." He pointed his hand to the north and south ends of Datong Road. "The two people going north have run far away, so I certainly can't see clearly. The one who escaped to the south was still very close. I saw him very clearly. It was really that tall guy surnamed Zhao. I am used to seeing his back, so I can't be wrong." (151)</p>
<h3>"Watching and Caring" Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Yun Si</p>
<p>On the evening of June 24th, I suddenly felt feverish. The next day, I couldn't even eat; however, for the sake of my work, I had to pull myself together and continue working. I endured day by day like this, and by July 5th, the fever was even higher, and I really couldn't bear it anymore.</p>
<p>At that time, a friend of mine strongly suggested that I go to a certain hospital on Xinzha Road for treatment. So, at 10:20 a.m. that day, I was admitted to the hospital. After completing the admission procedures, a hospital worker helped me into the ward. The ward was arranged with three rooms connected, and the middle room was attached to the nursing station, where there were always two or three nurses waiting to care for the patients. However, it just so happened that when I arrived at the ward, there was only one nurse, who was slumped over the table, dozing off. The worker shouted loudly for a long time, "Miss, a new patient is here, please arrange a bed!" Only then did the nurse raise her head and slowly stand up; she even stretched lazily, as if she hadn't slept enough. But, she had to come over and perform her duties. After about half an hour, the bed was finally made, but I was already dizzy, so I had to lie down and sleep. Because of the high fever, I took the opportunity to ask, "Miss, please take my temperature quickly!" Upon hearing this, the nurse immediately frowned and said, "You're such a nuisance!" and then she left.</p>
<p>I endured the pain until a little after five o'clock, when three doctors came into the ward. At that time, the nurse was again slumped over the table, dozing off. Just as the doctors approached the nursing station, the nurse was awakened by the sound of leather shoes. Her face turned red, and she hurriedly took out the "Chart." One of the doctors took the "Chart" and walked to my bedside, first examined me, wrote out a prescription, and then said to the nurse, "After a while, please give him an enema!" Who knew that upon hearing this, the nurse said, "How annoying! Another enema to give." Then she forcefully pushed the "Chart" into the cabinet, making a loud bang, like a hand grenade exploding. The sound awakened those trauma patients who were sound asleep.</p>
<p>In short, that nurse just scolded and reprimanded every day according to her mood. Almost all the patients complained and silently endured their suffering.</p>
<p>Breaking down the word "nurse" [看護] (kanhu) into its components: "看" (kan) means to watch over patients, and "護" (hu) means to protect patients. In such a large-scale hospital, I don't think there should be nurses who don't uphold these principles. It should be understood that in addition to "watching and caring" for patients, nurses should also have a "comforting" heart. How can they cause patients even more distress? I hope all nurses will correct their faults if they have them, and strive to improve if they don't! (Compliments)</p>

<h3>The First Page in Musical History — Memories of the Occupation of Oslo</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Oslo, the capital of Norway, with a population of 250,000, was occupied by German troops on April 9th of this year. Although this event has already become yesterday's news, the details of what happened are quite memorable. I have specially translated the report from the Chicago Daily News below for the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>Prior to this, when the German army attacked the city, the vanguard force consisted of only 1,500 men. After arriving, because the number of troops was small and military weapons were not used, they adopted a method of hypnotizing people with music. They first divided into several small teams, each carrying musical instruments, and played German waltzes and American joyful tunes along the main roads. One of the teams was playing on the steps of the State Council. The people of Oslo were pitiable; they swarmed up in groups, all excitedly competing to enjoy the music, forgetting that the enemies were standing in front of them. As a result, 1,500 German soldiers occupied a big city with a population of 250,000 all day without encountering any resistance!</p>
<p>Two days later, an almost identical "comedy" was staged in the same place. This time, the main force of the German army arrived, totaling 20,000 men. Within half an hour of landing, only the sound of a large chorus could be heard on the docks. The infantry was in the front, the artillery in the middle, and the transport team followed behind. As they landed, they were all singing a famous German song called "Going to Town." When the people of Oslo saw this phenomenon, they still believed that nothing serious had happened.</p>
<p>Finally, when planes painted with the swastika flew in groups in the sky but did not drop bombs, the people of Oslo realized that their capital had fallen. It was too late to resist! The German subjugation of Norway was achieved through the complementary forces of military and music. In musical history, we should also record this event on a page!</p>
<h3>A Look at the Yongchun Society, Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>The Yongchun Society, led by Li Wanchun, has not been to Shanghai for nearly three years. In response to renewed invitations, they are making a comeback, but the lineup is slightly different than before. Therefore, I have listed the lineups of the Yongchun Society's previous visits to the South as follows:</p>
<p>Year 24 (at Gong Wu Tai) Year 25 (at Huangjin)</p>
<p>Lead role Li Wanchun</p>
<p>Martial male lead Mao Qinglai</p>
<p>Clown Xiao Kuiguan Zhang Yongliang</p>
<p>Painted face Gao Binfeng</p>
<p>Acrobatic clown Liu Binsheng</p>
<p>Acrobatic actors Yu Binan Wang Delu Li Dechun Zhang Fuhua</p>
<p>Year 27 (at Huangjin)</p>
<p>Lead role Li Yuchun</p>
<p>Martial male lead Mao Qinglai Zhao Shengbi</p>
<p>Young male lead Gao Weilian</p>
<p>Painted face Su Lianhan Chen Furui</p>
<p>Old male lead Chen Xiguang</p>
<p>Martial female lead Zhu Shengfu</p>
<p>Acrobatic clown Liu Binsheng</p>
<p>Acrobatic actors Gao Shenghong Bao Shengqi Yu Binan Wang Delu Li Dechun Zhang Fuhua</p>
<p>Clown Zhang Yonglu (i.e. Zhang Yongliang)</p>
<p>Year 29 (at Gengxin)</p>
<p>Lead role Li Wanchun</p>
<p>Female lead Li Junong Gu Yulan</p>
<p>Martial male lead Lan Yuechun Jiang Tielin</p>
<p>Young male lead Yan Qinglin</p>
<p>Painted face Qiu Shengrong Wang Yongchang Chen Furui</p>
<p>Clown Zhang Yonglu</p>
<p>Old male lead Yang Zonglin</p>
<p>Acrobatic clown Liu Binsheng</p>
<p>Acrobatic actors Wang Delu Bao Shengqi Yu Yiting</p>
<p>Based on the Yongchun Society's previous lineups in Shanghai, this performance's lineup is the most complete. Gu Yulan, one of the female leads, originally named Yulanhua, trained at the Binqing Society. She and Wanchun are like siblings, and she has been to Shanghai several times, so no introduction is necessary. Li Junong is making her first trip south, so it is necessary to introduce her. Junong transitioned from an amateur to a professional performer and is a disciple of the late old opera singer Yu Yuqin. She performs female lead and martial female lead roles and has Yuqin's true legacy, which is quite unique. This time, she joined the Yongchun Society to collaborate with Wanchun, and it is expected that there will be many wonderful performances. Lan Yuechun, the martial male lead, was Wanchun's old partner. Yuechun and Wanchun are also like siblings; they both trained at the Binqing Society. When they starred in the old capital, all the plays they performed achieved the effect of beautiful flowers and green leaves. They separated due to some reason, and it has been more than ten years since then. This time, because Mao Qinglai left, Wanchun re-invited Yuechun to collaborate. They are familiar with the routine, and Yuechun should be able to handle it with ease. Jiang Tielin is Wanchun's disciple. His martial skills are well-grounded, and he can fight and flip, completely in the "ruthless" style. Yan Qinglin, the young male lead, is the son of the old opera singer Jiuzhenfeng and the top disciple of Jiang Miaoxiang. He follows Jiang Liu's style, and his singing and recitation are excellent. Qiu Shengrong, the painted face, is well-known to the people of Shanghai. Wang Yongchang is also a transition from amateur to professional performer, with a burly figure. His art follows Hao Shouxin's style, and he is quite similar to Hao. After becoming a professional, he immediately joined the Yongchun Society and has been with them for many years. Wanchun regards him as his right and left hand. In all the plays written by Wanchun, Yongchang occupies an important position. Chen Furui is the only talented painted face from the third class of Fu Liancheng. His art follows his senior brother Hou Xirui. He has been with Li Wanchun the longest, but unfortunately, he is short and fat, lacking aesthetic appeal. Zhang Yonglu, the clown, originally named Qisui Chou, is also a disciple of the Binqing Society. He was initially a supporting role in the Yongchun Society. After Xiao Kuiguan left, Yonglu became the leading clown. His skills are not weak, and he can make a loud sound. He is a promising talent among clowns. As for Liu Binsheng, Bao Shengqi, Wang Delu, and Yu Yiting, they are all Wanchun's subordinates, so I won't go into detail.</p>

<h3>Nan Tiesheng's Coming to Shanghai is Scheduled</h3>
<p>— Ke Yun Louzhu</p>
<p>Nan Tiesheng, known as the "Mei Lanfang" of Hankou, performed at the Huangjin last autumn, and the reviews were quite good, leaving a deep impression on the people of Shanghai. Due to the great flood in the north, the supporting actors could not be gathered, making it difficult to fully display his talents. After performing for the remaining performances, he quickly returned north. Now, he has been invited by Huangjin to continue the performance after Yu Hua. This time, he is bringing with him the male lead Yang Baosen and a young male lead, who will be replaced by Yu Zhenfei.</p>
<p>Yang Baosen's singing style is vigorous. He has a deep understanding of Shu Yan's Qin腔 [Qinqiang], which is quite similar, and has already received good reviews. Yu Zhenfei is proficient in both Kunqu and miscellaneous plays, with a very deep foundation. His performances are neither fiery nor lukewarm, but gentle and refined. Whenever the plot becomes tense, he reveals his passion, using both voice and expression, which is particularly unique. In the current young male lead scene, he can be called unparalleled. Since separating from Yu Shuang, he has been collaborating with Tiesheng, performing in various cities in North China, rising to fame. The two have a very close personal relationship, so Zhenfei's collaboration with Tiesheng is also limited to coming to the South. With Zhenfei as his assistant, Tiesheng has beautiful flowers and green leaves, which can be said to complement each other. Mei Wanhua's performance is uncertain, and Huang Guiqiu has a voice but lacks appearance, only Tiesheng's color and artistry are unmatched and flawless. This time, he will come south to give a public performance, and his theatrical talent will definitely be brought into full play.</p>
