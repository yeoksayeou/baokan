<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c13">中國抗戰第四年 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>三年之前，一九三七年即民國廿六年七月七日，深入中國河北省的日本軍隊，突向駐防蘆溝橋的中國軍隊挑釁，幷向北平天津兩地多方壓迫。那時候，距日本發動暴力，強佔中國遼寗吉林黑龍江熱河數省，已經六年；其間，兩國軍隊不斷的小接觸之外，有一二八淞滬之役，有長城各口的交綏；先後訂立淞滬協定，何梅協定，以局部交涉結束局部衝突。兩國外交途徑依然敞開，中國當局委屈求全，中國人民呑聲忍氣，作種種嘗試，猶望覓致解決紛爭的方法。及至蘆溝橋事件發生，證實了日本的無底野心，絕對沒有和解希望；日本復以大量陸軍開入山海關，大量海軍駛抵吳淞口；中國更由外交作最後的嘗試，亦歸無效，集會廬山，衆議僉同，遂決心爭取國族的獨立完整自由生存，決心忍受任何慘痛的犧牲，決心準備着長期的全面抗戰。不但抗戰務期必勝，自信必勝，同時努力奠定國族永遠基礎的建國事業；溯自蘆溝橋事件起，迄今整整三年。今日是其三年紀念日，是第四年的第一日。</p>
<p>我們崇尚道義，尊重理智；渴望道義在人與人，國與國之間，成為行動的軌範；渴望人與人羣的理智，能各自尅制其行動；不幸不然，以戰爭反證道義與理智雖為一部分人所崇尚尊重而不夠支配每一部分人。日本野心，悍然出之戰爭的手段；中國委屈求全，呑聲忍氣，經六年之久，始不得不應戰。戰爭的本質是野蠻的破壞，是殘酷的殺戮；同時，戰爭却亦是對於人類最嚴格最莊嚴最廣泛而深刻的試騐。中日兩國經過三年試騐，且尚在繼續被試騐之中。戰爭還在繼續進行，故試騐尚未張榜揭曉；但三年經過所得，旣已顯示了足夠決定最後揭曉的成績。</p>
<p>日本三年試騐何所示？違反道義，喪失同情，故在國際陷於完全孤立。師出無名，其言不順，故其政治上紛擾渾沌，到了現在，纔得加緊其久而無成之所謂一黨運動；猶待當國的首相米內，向一黨運動的中心人物近衛，請求「率直表明其對樹立新體制具體方策之所信」；暴露了已往的不率直，其間的缺乏共信與互信。由戰時盡然的物價騰貴，通貨膨漲，而在日本所引起的紛擾與恐慌，說明了日本經濟的匱乏不健全與人心的空虛惶惑。由彼軍事攻勢的失敗，政治攻勢的無聊，表白其態度的外強中乾，已成強弩之末。</p>
<p>中國三年試騐何所示？以上海一隅抗戰達三個月，以及抗戰迄今旣三足年，比較歐洲波蘭之戰，芬蘭之戰，挪威之戰，比較歐洲戰中所謂西綫之大戰，如何如何？相提並論，挈短度長，則中國抗戰的成績，雖問之天下，待之後世，必有公正的一致的光榮的定評。這當然的，絕對的，不是僥倖得之。試騐三年，未到最後；但檢討過程，亦可知趨歸。試於此戰比較歐戰之外，更以近頃比較曩昔；由曩昔日軍攻進名城大邑之多之速，比較近頃在豫南，鄂中，湘北，贛西乃至其他各處的戰况，皆遭華軍迎頭痛擊而潰退。曩昔華軍艱於扼守，退輒數十里，數百里；近頃則進退數里，亦再三鏖戰，若拉鋸；至於機動的反攻，據點的克復，大規模戰略的圍殲，捷訉頻傳，報不絕書，這是曩昔所難能，而為近頃所屢見。試騐三年，未到最後，但以近頃比較曩昔，確見日本實力日消，漸歸落沒，中國實力日長，漸趨優勢。這是事實鐵證，不是一面詛咒毀謗，一面空望奢願；故在中國抗戰的初期是務期必勝，自信必勝，現在把握必勝。事非僥倖得之，是應歸功於中國領袖的偉略雄才，威騰德化。歸功於中國將領士兵的忠貞勇敢，前仆後繼。尤必歸功於中國人民能體認國族的獨立完整自由生存，非爭取最後勝利不可；爭取最後勝利，非一德一心，羣策羣力不可；斯凡百犧牲，千辛萬苦而不辭。這是中國朝野所可自豪，亦中國的友人所無不推崇的。</p>

<p>日內瓦　法國無綫電台昨午宣稱、外長鮑多恩向外報記者發表演說、指斥英國在政治及軍事方面出賣法國、其言略謂、首先向德國宣戰者、乃英國而非法國、在荷比戰爭時、甚至弗朗德區戰爭時、英國所注意保衛者乃其本身、事實上英國從未派其主力軍隊至法國作戰、英軍軍艦在弗朗德區之戰績乃實行撤退、其所損失之兵力僅及其遠征軍之五分之一而已、法國在弗朗德區一戰、則損失軍隊達百分之五十、英國軍隊得以逃出弗朗德區、全恃法國軍隊之犧牲有以致之、法國海軍亦處處為英國流血犧牲、掩護其海軍、但法國此種公而忘私之精神所得之報酬、泊在沃朗港之法艦、英國海軍竟施以攻擊、且當時法國軍事陷於崩潰、不得不與德國簽訂停戰協定之時、英國已無一卒一兵留住法境、其後貝當上將與余曾一再向英國解釋、德國絕無要求法國投降之軍艦倂入德國艦隊、用以攻擊英國之意、停戰協定簽字後、法政府就海軍一項問題、曾再向英國表明意志、但事實上英國乘法國軍艦並無行動之時、竟毫無躊躇出以攻擊行動、法國人士聞之、無不憤激云、（六日海通社電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　此間外交界人士認為法外長鮑多恩向新聞記者發表之意見、證實法國具有改變外交政策之願望、決與英疏遠與軸心國接近、據鮑氏稱、邱吉爾曾於六月十三日承諾、法國倘若被迫而單獨議和、英國將尊重法國海軍之獨立、易言之、邱氏自食其言矣、鮑氏復謂法國曾企圖恢復英法之外交關係、未能如願以償、足徵邱氏早於十日前胸懷攻擊法國艦隊之計畫矣、法國認為英國旣不惜摧毀兩國間之友誼、則法國擬參加樹立歐洲秩序之活動、使英國無立足之地云、（六日海通社電）</p>

<p>— 沈體蘭</p>
<p>沈先生係敎育名家、為本報大中學生暑期徵文特撰此篇、沈先生以為大中學生無論是否加入暑校或夏令會、都應該注重集體硏究·集體服務·集體運動等適合時代的作業、本報認為研究服務運動的結果與經歷、都是寫作的絕好資料、希望　學生諸君、擬據了沈先生提示、切實做云、暑期將滿、寫成應徵文章、定多精彩、　編者</p>
<p>暑假是學校一年內最長的假期、學生們一到暑期、就發生怎樣消磨假期的問題、</p>
<p>近來年中等以上學校的學生、對於利用暑期工作已感覺興趣、並且做了種種的嘗試、這是很好的現象、可是一般學生、只注意消磨假期、而沒有把握住暑期工作的中心、究竟還是一樁遺憾的事、</p>
<p>暑期工作、固然應當致力於個人身心的修養和升學就業的準備、但單從個人立塲出發、是不够的、處在抗戰建國的大時代靑年們、應當怎樣做些國家民族有貢獻的事情、這纔是學生暑期工作最中心的課題呢、</p>
<p>學生們最普通的暑期工作、就是加入暑期學生、他們的目的往往是補足學分或補習不及格的學科、這可算是有益的工作、但這些學生中間、大多數是平時努力不够、成績略差、而想在暑期中設法補救的、動機已不很純正，况暑校時間短促學生、大都敷衍了事，只求期滿、能捕足學分成績、其他思想上的硏究和生活上的訓練、一槪不管、這樣的暑校對於活潑有爲的靑年、幾乎成了一個牢獄、決不是學生們適宜的暑期工作、至於一個理想的暑校、除了設置切要的科目、師生一致認眞敎學外，要有合用的圖書實騐的設備、尤其必須要有各項適合時代的課外作業、這是學生暑期工作的第一點、</p>
<p>歷年來基督敎靑年會所提倡的學生夏令會或夏令營、曾經吸引了許多有志和好動的靑年、尤其是基督敎的信徒、那裏面有靈修、有演講、有討論、有勞作、有運動、有交誼、是生活多方面平均發展的集體訓練、在敎育意義上、是很進步的設施，可惜只限制招收一部分的學生、不能普及大衆、近年來別的機關和團體、也開始舉行夏令會或夏令營、但缺乏基督敎的優良傳統成績、並不很好、我們希望凡有機會參加本屆靑年會夏令會或夏令營的學生，不要輕易放過夏令會、更要法重各項適合時代的作業、若是可能、應當把牠的範圍、擴大一些、使一般學生多有參加的機會、</p>
<p>對於不參加暑校和夏令會的學生、或已加入而還有些空閒的、很可以結合若干靑年同志、做各種集體的工作，這些團體、只要一個簡單的興趣中心或是硏究、或是運動、或是服務、要緊的在工作經常進行、沒有間訢、至於地點、能設法借到學校校舍、固然最好、否則、只有就同學家中輪流舉行、但這些團體、儘管各做不同的工作、大家應當有一個認識時代磨礪志氣的共同目標、吾則、便有落伍腐化的危險、至於服務性質的工作以民衆學校義務學校爲最簡便學生在暑假中、往往喜歡旅行，抗戰以來、更有不少靑年、想到內地去、但目下旅費相當昂貴、除了已經決定到內地去升學就業的人、可以去了、不必回來以外、其餘的只能就近到浙東江南一帶去走走、比較還算簡省、但只是走馬看花、沒有多大意義、最好能有親戚朋友的介紹、得到一些臨時的工作或訓練、我們在內地飽吸了自由的空氣、再回到孤島上來、可以使我們眼光更遠大、意志堅定、膽量更雄偉、携備担負這大時代中艱苦的任務、</p>

<p>—七月六日止—　聖凱瓊</p>
<p>（一）甘肅省銀行增資</p>
<p>甘肅省銀行增資業經財部核准、同時董事長水梓、總經理徐元堃、於七月一日正式就職、（見二日申報、）甘肅省銀行是在戰事發生後成立的、它的大概的情形、一般金融界以及硏究金融情况的人是很生疏的、此地作比較詳細的介紹、以供各方面的參考、</p>
<p>甘省行的前身是甘肅平市官錢局、是用以整理停業的甘肅農工銀行所發行的錢票、但因無準備金、當時不能兌現、價格跌至每四十串合洋一元、二十二年四月十七日、錢局發行新票、計分十枚、二十枚、五十枚、一百枚四種、一面依每十吊換新票一吊收換舊票、一面規定新蔡四吊合洋一元、而無限制兌現、該局直屬財政廳、除發行外、兼營匯兌存放各項業務、</p>
<p>戰事發生之後、政府爲藉省市銀行的機構以發展西北各省的經濟起見、在二十八年六月一日正式改組爲甘肅省銀行、採取董事制、以財政廳長梁敬　爲董事長、水梓·許元方爲常務董事、賈繼英·顧祖德·張維·鄭恩卿四人爲董事、李世軍·裴建準·施奎齡三人爲監察人、該行在平市官錢局時代、因爲組織上的基金上的以及其他事實上的關係、對於應行辦理的事項、無從辦理、自改組後、在政府金融政策之下、負有發展地方生產、促進省際貿易、擴充內地金融、獎勵農村生產底四項重要的使命、所以在八月份添設信託部、許元芳任主任、馬公瑛吳浩然任副主任、九月一日起辦理全國通匯、爲輔助該省工業起見、特向工業合作協會貸款八十萬元、辦理各項工業合作、</p>
<p>該行現有蘭州·肅州·臨洮·天水·平凉等分行、凉州·甘州·臨夏·靜寗·徽縣·定西·秦安·成縣·安西·永登·隴西·渭源·碧口·張家川·西峯鎭·等辦事處、因爲由錢局改組而來、發行業務繼續辦理、據二十八年七月二十九日該行發行檢查會報吿、二十八年五月份止、發行總額是三、八二五、六二二·五〇元、內中輔幣券三、五九七、四二〇元、銅元券（九一二、八一〇吊）折合二二八、二〇二·五〇元、</p>
<p>甘肅省向來僅有中央銀行分行一家、和中國農民銀行分行辦事處農貸所共二家、在二十七年中央銀行添設一辦事處、二十八年交通銀行又往設立蘭州分行和天水辦事處、故金融機關極少、省銀行成立之後、雖能普遍地成立新式的銀行分支行辦事處、以去發展甘肅省的金融經濟、但是資力不足、是不能負荷它的重要的使命、增資實在是急不容緩了、</p>
<p>（二）宋子文氏赴美底使命</p>
<p>自中國銀行董事長及前任國民政府財政部長宋子文氏赴美之後、頗爲中外人士所注意、根據各方面的報道、宋氏所晤談的人物、在政治方面是羅斯福總統、國務卿赫爾、副國務卿威爾斯、英國駐美大使羅士安、在金融方面的人物是財政部長毛根韜、建設銀公司董事長瓊斯、進出口銀行行長皮爾遜、據關係人物所宣稱、或謂社交性質、或謂重溫友誼、彷彿宋氏此行專爲酬酢而往的、</p>
<p>可是酬酢是進行使命前的一種技術、在酬醉之後、便要轉入正常的途徑、然則宋氏的使命是什麼呢？從它所晤談的人物分類可知有兩種、一是金融的使命、一是政治的使命、關於後者此處應該放棄不談、關於前者個人的觀察如：</p>
<p>美國政府在中日戰事發生之後、對於中國在金融方面的援助先有一九三八年十二月的二千五百萬美金信用借款、後有一九四〇年三月七日的二千萬美金信用貸款、按照條例美國進出口銀行在第一次貸款後、本已不能繼續借款、而在中國財政使節團努力活動、與中國政府還債信用之佳、及還債能力之强的情况下、美政府特不顧麻煩、通過新法—卽由國會通過增加進出口銀行資本美金一萬萬元內撥付之、並修正對外借款法律、使第二次借款成立、這兩次借款底使用和保證、均是輕過中國環球貿易公司一方面用信用借款購買五金·汽油·載重汽車·造路機器·開　及溶　機器·藥品以及其他建設上必需的原料、一方面則供應美國實業上所需將桐油·錫鑛·及其他原料輸往去償債、可是在歐洲局勢突變之後、日本對於遠東虎視耽耽、首對法屬越南提出禁運資源接濟中國、更對英國提出緬甸禁運的要求、復包圍香港截斷與重慶的通道、則中美兩國如何圓滑「各取所需」的交易，不因日本的干涉而生窒碍、這是宋氏所要進行金融使命中的第一點、其次目下自由中國的抗建經濟政策在於能够自給自足、據經濟部長翁文灝稱、「際茲日人行動迫近重慶之供給路綫、國民政府已在儘力從事以期自給自足、自都城西移已來政府已發布許多法律與條例、以改進及扶助內地豐富省分之生產」、（見合衆社四日電）但是現在還未完全能够達到這一個目的是無疑問的、那末對於改進及扶助所需要的各種工具當然是迫切的大量的、故在日人行動迫近重慶的供給路綫之前、（未完）</p>

<p>昨日上午米市、緣評價關係、難能超越、無甚榮辱、堪稱定格、蓋早市、無論內地浙紹幫及本鄉店胃、悉因今日星期例假、踴躍購進、故賣方續圖扳持、但作客吃盤不鬆、均照隔日原盤交易、迨至午市、內地銷塲轉懈、若素賴彼幫去路之東京　尖紅米碎尖等一般下段貨、反見帶軟、結果計收盤價一號陳西貢仍爲六十六元、六十五元半、二號六十四元半、六十四元、一號邏暹六十六元、六十五元半、二號六十四元二三角、六十四元、火絞六十五元半、六十五元、香港尖六十四元半、六十四元、六十三元三角、六十三元、而東京　尖祗六十二元、次六十元、海防紅米六十一元半、六十一元、混合碎五十三元、次至五十元、米茶五十七元、五十六元、次五十四元、較貶五六角、惟高檔挺足限盤、回籠貨廿六裝二號暹米開價卽跳一元、爲七十二元、旋又再加五元、爲七十二元半、十八裝開七十五元、後貨方喊高一元、未續妥、計成交的一百五十噸、</p>
<p>粳糯米來源、仍僅粳貨抵埠近千包、銷傷方面、傳聞粳米塲外暗盤尙屬平常、所以售盤未起變化、均與前市相仿、不過糯米猶以貨乏胃香、續提半元、金漂特元六十六元、常丹白元六十四五元、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨現粉供應、除阜豐廠維持本街實銷外、福新廠繼續停售、惟內地雜牌粉新有二三萬包運滬、滬日廠出品之綠鳳凰等牌、期貨均有供出、需要者不得不轉移及之、聞昨日雙獅金山價爲十六元二三角、綠鳳凰現粉十六元三角半、七八月份期粉十六元四角三分至五角、成交的有四五千包、阜豐廠批出老車脾等亦有五千包左右、仍維十五元二角原盤、又聞客幫方面辦去三四號粉回籠貨二三千包、售價亦與廠盤相埒、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新小麥來源、絡繹不絕、到貨共計九車、額計一萬餘包、但均爲日廠所壟斷、華廠方面之搬運證、迄未正式頒發、故福新廠最近已定過澳麥一船、昨聞阜豐廠繼定澳洲一船、一說三千餘噸、價仍合三十元左右、後批尙在接洽、在此新麥湧登時期、而反亟亟需求外麥、此亦被環境所支配也、</p>

<p>紗巿良好、　勢轉佳、此因實際交易進步、香港方面採辦甚殺、據云廣州灣可以裝運貨物矣、於是港幫購買力增强、同時寗波幫需求亦屬活躍、所以人心振奮、市塲上某業公司收進雙馬廠單四五百包、檯面急顯緊象矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣尙平、因海外棉巿無甚變化、惟外匯又見下縮、雙馬市價平平、爲八百八十五元、旋聞廣幫對於現紗搜羅殷切、市傳江西幫亦有交易、人氣突緊、市盤步步上升、塲中散戶之籌碼、被大戶獨家牧進後、較爲乾枯、多方乃乘機吸收而上升、至九百二十五元收盤價爲九百二十二元、　半日間成交統計三千一百十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三十七元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如右、</p>

<p>「我們相仿下列幾項原則是顛撲不破的眞理，卽凡人都是生而平等，他們都享有幾種天賦的權利：生命，自由，追求幸福，乃是其中的三者。為求取獲這些權利起見，人民之間乃設立政府，其統治權係被統治者所授予。任何政府破壞這些目的時，人民有權予以改組或予以廢止而另組新政府以促進他們的安全與幸福…」這是一七七六年七月四日美國國民代表大會所通過的獨立宣言的一段，也是一百六十四年以來，美國民治精神的圭臬。在這世界民治與獨裁兩大勢力互爭消長的重大時期，這種獨立宣言自然更有意義。</p>
<p>美國新任陸軍部長史汀生說，「長距離轟炸機已把美國防綫伸展到大西洋的遠處，拍托里科，百慕大，紐芬蘭，及加拿大的東北部都包括在內。一個勁敵在其中任何一處取得根據地即可轟炸我車東部海岸。我國的國防問題因之愈加嚴重。今日我國仍得時間重整備者殆賴英國尚能控制北大西洋。我國處這情勢之下援助北大西洋英國的海權，對於我國自身的利益，影響極為重大」。這樣說來，美國東部的國防綫已伸展到北大西洋，這就令人想到英國前任首相鮑爾溫所謂英國的國防綫在萊茵河一句話了。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統在一九三二年十一月當選之後，到一九三六年又當選連任，法定任期四年，到明年一月二十日屆滿。共和黨已於上月二十八日推舉電氣業富商威爾基為該黨總統候選人，民主黨則定於本月十四日在芝加哥舉行全國代表大會，推舉候選　總統。共和黨在費城舉行全國代表之前，競爭總統候選資格的，原以紐約地方法院檢察官杜威，參議員塔虎脫和范登堡呼聲最高，結果何以穿出一位Dark　Horse威爾基來呢。這種局勢的變化完全受歐戰的影響。杜威年事甚輕，似欠應付危局的閱歷，況且他在競爭預選時，曾經迭次發表極端孤立的政見，後來歐局劇變，這種「祇掃自已門前雪，莫管他人屋上霜」的主張就不適時宜了。塔虎脫和范登堡兩位的競選演說，也會同樣的主張孤立，因乃一同落選。威爾基出道晚，沒有發表過作繭自縛的言論，乃得隨民意的趨嚮，發表援助英國的主張，其幹部及全國民意類多擁護其打破成例，競選第三任總統，不過他本人還保持着緘默。據美國政論家沙利文說，美國民意的向背天天不同。英國危險如何，美國援助的程度適與之成正比例。從現在到十一月選舉的時期裏，歐占如已停止，那末，美國的民意將回歸內政方面，羅斯福的地位因必極不利。因為每個人都明白羅斯福當總第三任總統的機會端賴美國民心的注意戰爭。如以內政問題為競選的題材，羅斯福當選的機會就減少了。總之，美國政局的前途還須視歐戰的發展為轉移。</p>
<h3 id="c108">邱吉爾的身世 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>英國戰時總揆邱吉爾，簪纓世家，歷任顯職。其功業彪炳，別具一格，初與英國各大政治家不同。物望所歸，萬流景仰，其出任艱鉅也，完全出自國人擁戴，與挾政黨以自重　價者，逈異其趣，眞可謂民治精神之表現矣。</p>
<p>邱吉爾果為何種人耶？此問題，取決與其立傳者可矣；夫立紀傳人者，必稽考其人之一生功業，此與調丹鉛以傳人形者，必就其人面貌上之特徵，加以精審之視察者，殊途同歸。茲者，吾人所知有限，充其量，不過如一攝影師之所見者耳。</p>
<p>凡吾人可以求知於邱吉爾者，似已知之審矣。其一生地位之陟黜；豐隆之軀體，閒靜之笑容，敏銳之答語，以及聲調和諧之公眾演說等，均歷歷在人耳目。</p>
<p>然則吾人何以理解其為人乎？邱吉爾自陸軍下士，以躋於戰時總揆，豈其人果有獨到之處，能令其各個方面，融匯於一爐耶？自則不能不求諸其人之出身矣。</p>
<p>吾人如稽考其家乘，而與其歷來之事業相印證，當知邱吉爾一生之特徵，殊與其祖父馬爾巴羅公之地位不相稱，蓋邱吉爾作風，實不類公爵之後裔。邱氏之從政也，以至誠及勇氣，醉心於自由主義，不喜貴族，嘗冀以重稅，與限制上議院席數，削弱貴族權力。其思想言行，無一處能表示其出身貴冑。其外祖為美國人，豈其　義乃獨深耶？</p>
<p>其父蘭杜爾夫邱吉爾擬娶紐約女子裘羅姆女士為室。裘氏兩姊妹，原係璧人一雙，但渠則獨愛「黑裏俏」。兩女之母其時則居於巴黎。公爵聞訊未免一驚，即裘羅姆夫人亦為之興緻索然。良以一八七三年間，越大西洋以結褵之舉，雙方均以為事非經見；少男少女祇有假以時日，以待家長之憐愛應尤耳。但未屆歲杪，有情人人終成眷屬，倫敦人士且知蘭杜爾夫公爵夫人者，乃一活潑潑之黑美人也。</p>
<p>婚筵高張，嘉賓畢集，自愛德華太子以次，莫有登門道賀。迪斯拉利老政治家座前，樽酒未盡，以白蘭地和水而飲，迥其首，正對主人，口中喃喃，出以特殊之音調曰，「余親愛之蘭杜爾夫乎，余已啜香賓，罄紅酒，乾巴德溫之杯，弗欲再飲矣，」其風趣有如是者。新夫女置身社會，孤芳自賞。新郎初入仕途，以保守黨記名。然以結婚未久，經濟上難免稍有問題。而樓上育嬰室中時已誕生一孩，伊倆卽賜以文斯登·利奧那·斯賓塞之名焉。首尾二字為源自邱吉爾之本族，中一字則取自其外祖，紐約城利奧那·裘羅姆者也。</p>
<p>邱吉爾生平，初無大西洋彼岸之氣味滲雜其間。以邱氏之閥閱門第，少年英俊，自以就學於哈羅學校及陸軍大學為至當。迨至一八九六年間。英軍偃武不動干戈。邱吉爾乃退而求諸國外，卒得之於大西洋彼岸。時西班牙軍隊，方為古巴軍遊擊戰術所困，不遑暇給。邱吉爾加入古巴軍充騎兵，此為其所蘊藏之紐約胎息，顯露於外之第一遭焉。</p>
<p>厥後服役英國正規軍，開赴印度西北邊疆作戰。不久又遠走菲洲蘇丹。其時凱啟納勳爵方用兵於尼羅河上游，為被害之戈登復仇，在喀土伊郊外，對土著烏合之眾，嚴行誅伐。</p>
<p>未幾，英兵又奉調南菲；邱吉爾以戰地記者資格，隨同出發，尋被荷蘭族移民所捕，卒賴智勇雙全，於一月之後安然脫險。</p>
<p>面菲之戰終了，邱吉爾解甲歸田，從事社會事業。實際上此「古巴騎兵」已儼然一政治家矣。大西洋彼岸情形亦復相仿，羅斯福上校於邱吉爾入國會之一年，亦當選副總統。邱羅二人不僅出仕之時期為偶合，即兩人反抗強暴之作風亦復相若。美國對「為富不仁」之流，施以嚴厲之攻擊未久，邱吉爾亦利用其方興未艾之權力，對大地主及世襲之貴族議員，予以當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>邱吉爾此時為左派自由黨之一員，勞合喬治執政之日，依之如左右手。其對反對黨，仗其滔滔雄辯，攻擊不遺餘力，常曰，「自由黨者，數百萬徬徨無歸之民眾所依託也。」</p>
<p>時為一九一〇年，世界大局愈趨黑暗，當時德皇威廉苦心積慮，欲置英國於死地。德人整軍經武，大事造艦，英人極目於北海之上，為之恍惚迷離焉。邱吉爾時方任職內政部大臣。一日，倫敦東區之武裝警士，搜捕一外國之無政府黨機關，雙方發槍互轟，邱氏竟親臨其地勘察。全國人士對此「古巴騎兵」之所為，未免小吃一驚。一九一一年邱吉爾調任海軍大臣，乃致其全力於國防政策之闢劃。邱氏出身行伍，今則以走卒而成為海軍專家矣；當時迫於情勢，不得不作擴軍之計。</p>
<p>一九一四年八月歐戰爆發，某夜，邱吉爾自外搖擺至唐寗街十號，以作戰命令業已通知各艦之消息，吿諸各閣僚。英艦隊迭在海洋放其光芒。斯時之「古巴騎兵」已掩沒政治家多多。凡其前此操之過切之行為，時人以其立此偉績而咸寬宥之矣。大戰最後一期中，邱吉爾任軍火部長之職，凡所設施，多所更張。</p>
<p>邱吉爾飽經風霜，愈見老練，其政治上之作風，一變旣往，而與保守黨作密切之連繫。一九一七年，俄國革命，邱氏為之痛心疾首，對於紅黨所為，不無間言。嗣後因愈趨於保守主義，邱氏在政治上未免孤立。但勇敢之政治家決不能孤獨而退縮。邱吉爾旋任財政大臣者五年。</p>
<p>此時鮑爾溫炙手可熱，卽金本位猶存在，而希特勒尚未露頭角之時也。嗣後鮑爾溫與麥唐納二老執政，一味退讓，邱吉爾之粗綫條作風，英雄無用武之地。卒掛冠而去，有如惱怒之先知亞利米，在曠野中大聲疾呼。</p>
<p>然而德人之所作所為，無一不為邱吉爾所言中；華水烽火旣起，邱氏膺國民之重託，東山再起，八閱月後，擢任首相，行當領導不列顛帝國與希特勒一決最後勝負焉。（譯紐約泰晤士報）</p>

<p>— EL</p>
<p>紐約世界博覽會，去年曾轟動一時，眞像舊金山金門萬國博覽會會長迪爾所說：紐約博覽會為前無古人，後無來者的最大盛會，一生難得一見。今年的博覽會為其第二屆，會期從五月十一日起至十月二十七日止，共計一百七十晝夜。</p>
<p>去年的博覽會成積并不十分滿意，博覽會當局因於今年二屆會期中大事改革，以期獲得更多的遊客，和更大的收入。去年失敗的原因，第一為太嚴肅，第二為收費過鉅。今年已竭力避免這兩個缺點。從開幕典禮起，一切都是簡單而隨便，「高冠白硬領」的儀注槪行從略，力求「平民」化。所以開幕日的形式，無非戲要·娛樂而已。今年最大的特色，就是添增了無數的玩要塲子，名為大白路，象徵紐約最熱鬧街市，夜間燈光燦爛。</p>
<p>門票售價，去年最高票價為美金七角半，今年已減至五角。寄放汽車收費也減至二角半，飲食等費，也竭力普遍化，有五分和一角的食堂，遊客以最低的代價，可謀一飽。其他如旅費宿費等，在可能範圍中，均較往年便宜。博覽會當局又致力於宣傳，及贈獎，金　匙競賽，遊客可免費得汽車一輛，以資吸引，</p>
<p>今年的博覽會，以「和平與自由」為口號。去年秋間，第一屆博覽會正在如火如荼的時候，歐洲風雲突變，繼之戰事爆發，錦繡世界，頓成修羅之場，美國雖然沒有捲入　渦，可是鑒於侵略者的日趨猖獗，未免寒心，頗思在這萬國一堂的場中，倡導和平自由。所以在開幕的一天，有許多地方都是來發揮這一個善意。</p>
<p>會場在紐約布羅克林區，交通非常方便，自最熱鬧的孟哈頓區去，只消十五分鐘的火車便到達。佔地一千二百十六英畝，分展覽和遊藝兩大部份。全會場的設計建築等費已達美金一萬五千五百萬元。將來閉幕之後，除主要的屋宇剩留外，其他一切拆去，改為一個大公園，以為市民的永久遊息場所。會場每天上午九時開幕，主要陳列館十時開幕。展覽部份晚十時閉門。遊藝塲地深夜二時收歇。</p>
<p>開幕盛況</p>
<p>今年的世界博覽會係於五月十一日正午開幕。儀式簡單而充滿活潑氣息。會場入口共有十二處，開幕典禮係在東區入口處舉行。清早就有許多愛看熱鬧的人等在那裏。一到正午紐約市長賴加第亞正式剪綵開幕。他當時嘴裏說：「我現在正式為一九四〇年紐約世界博覽會啟幕」，原詞英文一共只有九個字。當時奏着美國的國樂，上面有飛機翱翔，軍隊遊行，旌旗招展，此外還夾着整千累萬的男女，盛況從來未有。</p>
<p>下午二時在「和平廣場」中舉行奉獻典禮，完全以大會的「和平與自由」口號為中心。當時紐約州長雷門向二萬聽眾演說，他說美國必須加強海陸空軍，務使「任何國家，或幾個國家，不敢侵略我們」。羅斯福總統也有一函致大會，他說：「這是國際間常識的一種表徵，博覽會尤宜獲極大的成就」。市長演說，解釋二屆大會中已經沒有德蘇兩國的陳列品，他說博覽會「決不要這兩個國際間的無賴參予其間。」</p>
<p>主持典禮的為博覽會董事長吉勃生。行禮時，六千個美國童子軍，在廣場前排成一面活的美國旗。同時有萬餘人的大遊行，裏面有童子軍，美國陸軍，海軍，國防軍，和十六國代表，民眾等。十六國代表中，荷蘭居第一個榮譽地位，其次為比利時，捷克，丹麥，愛沙尼亞，法蘭西，大不列顛，希臘，匃牙利，義大利，挪威，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，瑞士和瑞典。</p>
<p>與德國交戰的五國—比，荷，英，法，挪，少女，穿了各本國的服裝，各執本國國旗，在遊行隊中另成一組，以示敬意。領導大遊行者為一芳齡二十五歲的美國少女琪裘，代表「和平與自由」的精神。她穿的是白袍藍裾，丯度曼妙，由十二個男人做她的護衛（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c112">暑假里怎麼樣練習寫字（上） <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 沈百英</p>
<p>前幾天，有個小學邀我去演講，我就講這一個題目。現在把他抄錄下來，登在報端，公諸同好。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，你們在暑期裏，不是有假期作業嗎？自修的功課很多，寫字也是其中的一種照現在的狀況看來，寫字難不此讀書，常識等重要，但也不能整個暑期毫不練習。俗語說的:拳不離手，曲不離口，」凡是要靠練習的事，都應該天天溫習，不能停止的。一停止就要生疏，就要退步。所以我想把這句俗語，再添上一句話：「練習寫字，不能離開筆頭。」學校雖放暑假，寫字決不能連帶放去。非但不能放去，還要天天認眞練習，不可間斷。如果整個暑假，不練一决，將來假滿開學，寫出字來，簡直前後好像兩個人的成績了。</p>
<p>諸位或者要問：「暑假裏練習寫字，應該用什麼工具呢？」我的回答是，照新時代的眼光看來，調查現社會的應用，鉛筆和鋼筆比了毛筆的用處多，所以練習時不能專用毛筆。最好的辦法，大字用毛筆寫，小字用鉛筆或鋼筆寫，同時並用，不偏不廢，才不吃虧。</p>
<p>諸位或者再問：「練習的時間應該怎樣支配呢？」我可以用兩方面來說明：在一天中的練習時間，以上午因爲適宜。爲上午比較凉爽，寫起字來不容易疲倦。規定一次的練習時間，大槪以二十分　到四十分　爲最相宜。時間太短，肌肉的使用尚未純熟，忽然停止，決計得不到實益，等於沒有練習一樣；如果時間太長，寫到後來，必致神疲力倦，毫無進步，也不妥當。所以時間使用的得體不得體，也是一個重要的條作。</p>
<p>諸位或者又問：一我們在學校　練習寫字，有先生發下來的字帖可用，有先生寫示的範字可臨，如果在家裏練習，憑什麼東西寫呢？」我的回答是：</p>
<h3 id="c113">原來是一件事 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 余靑</p>
<p>先介紹一幅圖畫</p>
<p>「這圖，有些奇怪，」小朋友們一定要說。「不錯，這圖有些奇怪，更奇怪的，這還是一篇很好的作文呢！」我這樣說，小朋友要覺得寞名其妙了。</p>
<p>這是一個還有發見文字的印第安人畫的圖，也就是他們寫的字，作的文，用來記錄他們的事蹟，發表他們的意思。</p>
<p>其實這篇圖畫作文，閱讀起來並不難。那五隻獨木舟，裏面有許多人，表示他們波過湖去，向敵人進攻。馬上騎着的人，顯然是他們的首領。這决進攻，經歷了三天，因爲在那代表天空的三個括弧下面，有三個太陽。　與鷹，表示這决進攻的勝利，是由於他們作戰的英勇。那奇怪的獸，據說是豹，便是首領的名字。底下的那條蛇，表示他們全體凱旋，沒有一個被殺害。</p>
<p>如此說來，這不是一、　很好的記叙文嗎？</p>
<p>就拿我國的文字來說，最初原也是圖畫。我們現在寫的「日」「月」兩字，古時候作「　」「　」這不是太陽和月亮的圖嗎？所以畫圖，寫字，作文，原來是一件事，到後來才分了家。</p>
<p>再舉一個實例</p>
<p>假如你在馬路上走，有一個人拿着一個紙條給你看，上面寫着二個地名，原來是向你問路的。你略一思索，便把路由吿訴他：叫他先向那　走，穿着幾條馬路，再向那裏拐灣，又經過些什麼所在，才達到那目的地，那地方還有些特別標職。</p>
<p>可是你嘮嘮叨叨說了一大堆，他還是個莫名其妙。原來他是個初到上海的廣東佬，對於你的一口道地上海白，他是不能領敎的。</p>
<p>你弄得沒有辦法，只得從口袋裏掏出筆記簿與鉛筆，隨手扯下一張紙，把路由仔仔細細寫了，交給他，叫他照着走去。</p>
<p>可是又出乎你意料之外，他還是向你瞪瞪眼，搖搖頭。原來他一字不識，剛才那張地名紙，還是請敎別人寫的呢。</p>
<p>這可使你窘了，你將怎麼辦呢？我想你大槪會再扯下一張紙來，把路由畫成一個詳詳細細的圖，指給他看了。他這才向你點點頭，千謝萬謝，笑嘻嘻地照着你的指導走去了。</p>
<p>假如你這樣做，你就很自然地運用了三毬工具—寫字，作文，圖畫，這三種工具有一個共同目的，就是發表自己的意思，叫人家懂得你的意思。。一管簡陋的量尺</p>
<p>我們要知東西的長短，可以用尺量，要知道東西的輕重，可以用秤稱。我們寫的字，作的文，畫的圖，最好也有像尺和秤那樣的東西，可以測量一下。這可難了，寫字，作文，圖畫旣沒有長短可量，又沒有輕重可稱，無從測量起，不過上面所說的那偶共同目的，倒可以作爲一個簡陋的標準，大概地測量作文，寫字圖畫的好壞。在沒有找到更好的尺，更好的秤以前，可以勉强用用</p>
<p>那就是說，你的作文，寫字，圖畫，是好是壞，要看你所發表的意思，別人是否懂得，是否懂得透。</p>
<p>譬如你畫一張老虎的圖，別人看說：「這倒像一隻狗。」這顯見得你的畫圖出了毛病。如又你畫了一張風景畫，預備給人家欣賞，要引起人家的美感，可是人家看了，搖搖頭說：「難看極了，」那你的畫根本失敗了。</p>
<p>作文也是如此，譬如你寫一篇文字，描寫上海貧苦人的生活，想引起人家的同情心。可是人家拜讀了你的大文以後却說：他們的生活倒還過得寫意，那顯見得你的文章有些牛頭不對馬嘴。至於寫的字，最緊要的當然是寫得正確沒有錯誤，淸淸楚楚，不至使人看了，識不得你的字，以至發生誤會。</p>
<p>這當然是最初步的標準，而且是簡陋得可笑。不過小朋友不妨試試，去量量自己的作文，寫字與圖畫，也許有些幫助。此次申報主辦的假期作業競賽，就指定這三種工作，小朋友不妨就來一個實騐，看看這管尺到底有些用處嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c114">秀蘭鄧波兒自傳　（九） <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>不過你要知道，假做雖是假做，但也要用心用力的做去、記得有一天，我在練習「小將軍一幕中表演時，導演白德勒先生忽然舉起手來說道：「秀蘭這一塲，你表演得不够有生氣，請你再來試一試吧！」我聽了白德勒先生這句話，心中很不高興，幾乎要哭將出來。然而我終於依了他的話，用心地再試一下。這一日白德勒先生就歡呼起來道：「這就好了，親愛的，你本來是應該照這樣做的！」於是我也依然高興了。</p>
<p>這是第一次我覺得白德勒先生所說的話，確是不錯的，因此等到這一塲戲拍完之後，就走到他跟前，低低的說道：「白德勒先生，我覺得剛才的表演，的確是要不得的」接着我又對他微微地一笑，意思是說：「我們彼此理會得，可不是麼？」白德勒先生似乎曾抱我起來，在我頰上吻了一下，可是這個我已記不得了。</p>
<p>然而我一切都得歸功於媽媽，要不是伊的指示，我還不知這該怎樣表演哩。每逢我要開始工作，主演每一部影片時，伊總得先將本事細細地講給我聽。我還記得最初他們喚我表演「戰地嬰兒」時，給了我一份說白，媽媽帶我到攝影塲僻靜的一角，伊先把說白讀了一遍，不過幾分鐘的工夫，原來這部影片是短短的一卷，全部只須十多分鐘就可映完了。如今你看了我所主演的影片往往要一點多鐘，那就大大不相同了。伊讀完說白之後，再把本事講給我聽，一面不住的問我道：「你明白麼？親愛的，你可完全明白麼？」</p>
<p>我們從攝影塲坐了汽車回家去時，我又要求媽媽將那本事再講一遍，伊在講解之前對我說明在這一部影片中，是誰和我合演的，那一位是扮上校，那一位是扮政治家？我一時還不明白什麼叫上校，什麼叫政治家，又得刺刺不休的問問，而媽媽又得子子細細地講給我聽。</p>
<p>到了家裏，用過晚餐，爸爸給我洗了澡，穿上了一種浴衣，坐在浴室中，媽媽來給我整理那一卷卷的頭髮，隨後走到臥室中去，躺到床上，把被頭蓋上了，就對媽媽說：「媽媽，我已預備了。」媽媽卽忙關上了門，拿了那說白的簿子，生在我的床沿上，一句一句的讀給我聽，有時要長到一全頁，有時更不止一頁，這些說白，就是包含在那本事裏的。我照着媽媽所讀的，一句一句的跟着讀，一速五六次。當下伊又對我說。。「親愛的，你讀這一行行的說白時，一定是很快樂的。」媽媽聽我讀熟之後，就合上了簿子，而這些說白，我就得牢牢地記着，預備明天早上上攝影塲工作時用的。</p>

<h3 id="c115">從楊盛春南來想起楊小樓 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>被稱爲國劇宗師之楊小樓，逝世迄今，忽將三載；茲値楊派武生楊盛春南來，遇新懷舊，不禁感慨系之！自楊氏歿後，武生行以楊派頭銜炫耀於時者，有孫毓堃劉宗楊楊盛春高盛麟諸人。劉爲楊之外孫，自幼及長，無日不依傍楊氏，凡楊氏之聲容笑貌，惟宗楊知之最稔，所獲亦自以宗楊爲最豐，倘宗楊果能立志向上，勤學不輟，則現時能承小樓衣缽者，自舍宗楊莫屬，惜乎此豸紈袴成性，習於荒嬉，對於藝術，竟無意再求深造，遂使大好材料，日漸隳棄，以至於湮滅不彰，美玉埋於荒土，豈不大可惜哉！盛麟資質較决，學楊似乎才具不足，偶有是處，未能盡滿人意。楊盛春年當力壯，希望最大，惟須有名師爲之指導，方能成爲大器，孫毓堃材質俱佳，師承有自，學楊派以氣韻功力勝人者，亦惟有毓堃一人，惜其意志不堅，深染痼疾而不知戒除，若再因循坐誤，不圖振拔，則將來之成就，充其量亦徒成其爲一今日之孫毓堃而已。</p>
<p>且上述諸人，除孫毓堃外，多爲後進少年，所見之楊，乃係老年之楊，（如眼畏燈光而常瞌閉，上塲咳嗽，以及在塲上一切動作轉慢等。）而對於小樓壯年時之勇猛功夫，則朱嘗遇目，故今之學楊者，大都皆犯「衰」「瘟」二病，而楊之一身毛病，則皆習之未恐不肖，此實學楊者之大誤，猶諸滬上票友之學周信芳，必先使嗓音暗啞而後以麒派自炫者，同爲不可取法之下策也。</p>
<p>小樓之技藝，海內同欽，當其年將花甲之際，國人咸以其藝無傳人爲慮，時賢葉譽虎（恭綽）先生，且有「擇材而敎，使絕藝流傳」之貢獻，亦可見小樓藝術之見重於世矣。葉氏原函，愚有抄存，特爲錄刊如决，亦梨園大好史料也。</p>
<p>「小樓先生，往在北平，雖恒相見，而未及深談。僕於戲劇，本無所知，以酷好文藝，故對此亦頗具興趣。竊謂我國戲劇，今日宜亟有以保全其眞相與特色，方可進言改良。吾則眞相先失，何從知　得失。近年各劇家，爲趨時起見，已大半失其故步，而先輩凋零漸盡，後生能繼起者稀，斯尤此道之厄。執事藝術，超越儕輩，今無其敵，以隨波逐流之上海，對於執事，具眞賞者，尙不之人，足知實至然後名歸，此中尙有公理。惟鄙人所亟欲奉吿者，則於執事，應有覺爲吾國戲劇界之一特村，爲吾國戲劇界計，應負使自己絕藝，流傳於後之責。今尊年已過五十，體力有漸衰之傾向，不知高徒內，有無足以繼起之人？竊謂執事宜格外留意，選擇質美可敎者，盡力陶鑄，使窺蘊奥，庶絕藝不至無傳，而盛名亦與之俱永，比較之以財產遺子孫爲遠勝。病中所見，率臆直陳，惟鑒照不宣，葉恭綽。」</p>

<p>某律師公餘之暇，過我劇談，自國外而國內，由公務而治遊，繼乃同作公園之遊，見二妹珊珊迎面來，頻含其首，余諦視之，似曾相識，不能憶其芳名矣。旋就相語，一爲常州榮飛飛，一爲香港王味妹，甫自香港歸，蓋受歐洲風雲之餘波，不得不歸矣。據云，港客揮金之豪，較勝滬地，緣豪富多萃於此，故甚少商人較銖錙之習氣。飛飛已入麗都，風頭甚健，首夕坐檯七只，獲票三百五十金，大的亦有港來客爲之捧塲者。妹妹夜塲加入大華，聞生涯亦不惡，因其身量矮小，不宜與長人舞，故較飛飛稍遜耳。</p>
<p>園遊興闌，擬覓地一舞。時茶舞將盡，夜舞尙早，乃蒞止福煦路小舞塲。雖無音樂台，却有冷氣設備，舞女多於舞客，審視之，殊鮮佳麗。甫欲出，一女掀簾入，頗有三分似十餘年前之程硯秋，友固酷嗜程劇者，因復就坐，促余試舞，雖無飛燕之輕，進退疾徐，均尙有度。余促友曰，市票携出可耳，友不聽，登樓召之坐檯，每小時僅三元，如不値破費猶少也。登樓諦視，果佳，詢其名，曰張永娜，年十七，現肄業於某高中一年級，友出紙令書，居然中英俱可。因轉詢友，友以實吿，不信，曰，遊於此者，皆市井耳，律師必通文，子試書英文一篇，乃可置信，友固習法文者，幾爲所窘，時女態微傲，友遂市票携出，出門登汽車，余徵窺女，傲態已消失。抵大都會，見侍役趨承之勤，舞女寒暄之頻，乃亦足恭淺笑。是女固慧者，他日必大紅，今猶櫝中之美玉也。</p>

<p>「結婚」爲俄國大文豪果戈里費時十載的三幕諷刺喜劇，本當由上海劇社和上海劇藝社先後演出過，都很獲得好評。工華劇團，卽工部局華員俱樂部的話劇股，在業餘話劇界裏，名字並不生疏，會經演過了「名優之死」「阿Q正傳」「討漁稅」等十幾個戲：爲一宗旨純正的優秀劇團，因爲埋首苦幹，不願宣揚的緣故，所以和外界很少接觸。</p>

<p>秦默齋走到王麗蘭的屍體面前細細地瞧了一瞧，搖了搖頭，自言自語地說：「唉！眞可惜！這樣一位粉搓玉琢似的美人竟會這樣子下塲！咳，那兇手眞是太忍心了！」他又旋轉頭來。「喂，霍先生，倪探長，你們得着力些，這個人決不能讓他漏網。」</p>
<p>我暗忖秦默齋固然還保持着多嘴的脾氣，但同時也顯得這個已死的舞后，在生前確有着若干迷人的魔力。</p>
<p>霍桑冷冷地諷刺說：「你倒是這位王小姐的知音，祇可惜遲一些了！」</p>
<p>那警官想了一想，忽申辯似地說：「不，我是為着你們兩位啊。這是一位大名鼎鼎的交際花，現在給人家謀殺胃，報紙準會有大篇的記載。你們兩位旣然參與這件案子，要是拿不到兇手，那不單掃興，還是『盛名之累』哪！」</p>
<p>霍桑微微彎了彎腰。「謝謝你忠吿和鼓勵。」他燒着了紙烟，慢慢地坐下來。</p>
<p>倪金壽也感覺到霍桑的不耐煩，便沉着臉說：「秦警長，你要發表高論，也得找個相當的時間。別躭誤公事罷。</p>
<p>秦默齋閉緊了嘴脣，把頭頸縮了一縮，才舉起手來，向站在門口的四個抬扛夫招一招。</p>
<p>那四個身體結實的男子走進來以後，先將舁床放在地毯上，兩個人就動手搬移王麗蘭的屍體。那身體已經有些兒僵硬，放到舁床上時，已不怎樣平直，尤其是伊的頭向下倒掛着。霍桑重新站起來，又向這死后作一度最後的端視。我有一種奇怪的感覺，這樣一個浪費的墮落女性身上，怎麼沒有一件首飾。我這感覺却讓倪金壽發表出來。（三七）</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Fourth Year of China's Resistance War <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Three years ago, on July 7, 1937, the 26th year of the Republic of China, Japanese troops who had penetrated into Hebei Province, China, suddenly provoked Chinese troops stationed at Lugou Bridge and exerted pressure on Beijing and Tianjin in various ways. At that time, it had already been six years since Japan launched violence and forcibly occupied several provinces of China, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. In between, in addition to constant small contacts between the armies of the two countries, there was the January 28th Shanghai Incident and the engagements at various passes of the Great Wall. The Shanghai Agreement and the He-Umezu Agreement were successively signed to end local conflicts through local negotiations. Diplomatic channels between the two countries remained open. The Chinese authorities sought peace at the expense of principle, and the Chinese people swallowed their anger, making various attempts, still hoping to find a way to resolve the disputes. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, it confirmed Japan's bottomless ambition and absolute lack of hope for reconciliation. Japan again sent a large number of ground troops into Shanhaiguan and a large number of naval vessels to Wusongkou. China made a final attempt through diplomacy, which also proved ineffective. A meeting was held in Lushan, and the consensus was reached to resolutely strive for the independence, integrity, freedom, and survival of the nation, to resolutely endure any painful sacrifice, and to resolutely prepare for a long-term, all-out war of resistance. Not only would the war of resistance be won, with confidence in victory, but also efforts would be made to lay the foundation for the nation's eternal foundation in the cause of national construction. From the Lugou Bridge Incident to the present, it has been exactly three years. Today is its three-year anniversary, the first day of the fourth year.</p>
<p>We revere morality and respect reason. We yearn for morality to become the standard of action between people and between countries, and we yearn for the reason of people and groups to restrain their actions. Unfortunately, this is not the case. War proves that although morality and reason are revered and respected by a part of the people, they are not enough to govern every part of the people. Japan's ambition was brazenly expressed through the means of war. China sought peace at the expense of principle, swallowing its anger for six years before finally having to fight back. The nature of war is barbaric destruction and cruel killing. At the same time, war is also the most rigorous, solemn, extensive, and profound test for mankind. China and Japan have undergone three years of testing and are still being tested. The war is still ongoing, so the results of the test have not yet been announced. However, the gains from the past three years have already shown enough to determine the final outcome.</p>
<p>What has Japan's three-year test shown? Violation of morality, loss of sympathy, and thus complete isolation in the international community. The invasion was unjustified, its words were not justified, and therefore its politics were chaotic. Only now has it been able to intensify its long-unsuccessful so-called one-party movement. The current Prime Minister, Yonai, still has to ask Prince Konoe, the central figure of the one-party movement, to "frankly express his beliefs regarding concrete measures for establishing a new system," revealing the lack of frankness in the past and the lack of mutual trust. The turmoil and panic caused in Japan by wartime price increases and currency inflation illustrate the poverty, unsoundness of the Japanese economy, and the emptiness and bewilderment of the people's hearts. The failure of its military offensives and the futility of its political offensives reveal its outwardly strong but inwardly weak attitude, already at the end of its tether.</p>
<p>What has China's three-year test shown? Comparing Shanghai's three-month resistance in one corner and the three full years of resistance to date with the war in Poland, the war in Finland, the war in Norway, and the so-called great battles on the Western Front in the European war, how do they compare? Comparing them side by side, highlighting the strengths and measuring the weaknesses, the achievements of China's resistance war will surely receive a fair, consistent, and glorious assessment, whether asked of the world or awaited by future generations. This is of course, absolutely, not obtained by luck. The three-year test is not yet over, but reviewing the process can also reveal the trend. Compare this war with the European war, and compare recent events with the past. Comparing the number and speed with which the Japanese army attacked famous cities and towns in the past with the recent battles in southern Henan, central Hubei, northern Hunan, western Jiangxi, and other places, all of which were met with fierce counterattacks by the Hua army and collapsed. In the past, the Hua army had difficulty holding its ground, retreating dozens or hundreds of miles at a time. Recently, they advanced and retreated only a few miles, engaging in repeated battles, like a tug-of-war. As for mobile counter-offensives, the recapture of strongholds, and large-scale strategic encirclements and annihilations, news of victories is frequently reported. This was difficult in the past but has been repeatedly seen recently. The three-year test is not yet over, but comparing recent events with the past, it is clear that Japan's strength is declining day by day, gradually falling into decline, while China's strength is growing day by day, gradually gaining an advantage. This is ironclad evidence, not empty curses and slander on one hand and extravagant hopes on the other. Therefore, in the early stages of China's resistance war, there was a commitment to victory and confidence in victory. Now, we have a firm grasp of victory. This is not obtained by luck. It should be attributed to the great strategy and talent of China's leaders, as well as to their moral influence. It should be attributed to the loyalty, bravery, and self-sacrificing spirit of China's generals and soldiers. It must also be attributed to the Chinese people's understanding that the nation's independence, integrity, freedom, and survival cannot be achieved without striving for final victory, and that striving for final victory requires unity of purpose, collective wisdom, and collective effort, without shying away from any sacrifice, hardship, or suffering. This is something that the Chinese government and people can be proud of, and something that China's friends cannot but admire.</p>
<p>Japan is like that, China is like this. Three years have passed, all of which is magnificent history. The fourth year begins, and this is the stage for China to unleash its highest courage and strive for final victory. Glory fills the future!</p>
<h3 id="e14">On the 3rd Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Exhorts the People and Soldiers of the Nation to Enforce Spiritual Mobilization, Keep the National Covenant, Support the Government’s Military, Political and Economic Plans, With the Faith, Endurance, and Determination to Break Through Difficulties, to Create Lasting Happiness for Mankind <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: On the 3rd Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued an address to the people and soldiers of the nation, stating that on this important anniversary, he hoped that the people and soldiers would remember the greatness of our Founding Father’s revolutionary strategy, the depth of our ancestors’ heritage so that, when we could not but resist three years ago, we would make the policy to fight hard and become stronger, protect our national personality, and protect the justice of the world. He urged the soldiers and people of the nation to recall the tragic history of the last three years, and everyone to reflect on whether they are worthy of being citizens of this era, worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor and disciples of the Founding Father. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had not ceased to tell the soldiers and the people the truth of the success and failure of this war during these three years. What he has said should be checked with the facts. As we start the fourth year of the War of Resistance, we should evaluate the past, especially the last year, our circumstances and international relations, to realize that the victory is approaching, and the importance of our continued hard work. The banner for the Chinese War of Resistance is clear, and the goal is accurate. It is striving with all our power to preserve the survival of the nation, and independence of the country. We must have the Japanese army fully withdraw outside our borders, and restore our territorial sovereignty and the completeness of administration. We have no intention of harming the Japanese nation, and do not wish to form a deep feud with the innocent people of Japan. Today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made the following sincere points to our beloved soldiers and countrymen and must be followed and implemented by all. (A) We must enforce the National Spiritual Mobilization. We must indeed abide by the national covenant, genuinely practice the Three Principles of the People, support the National Government, and understand our obligations, observe discipline, and make the country and the nation the highest goal. The more the world changes, and the more tense the war, we must be more determined and brave. We must establish a solid and unyielding spiritual fortress that can withstand the final victory. (B) We must support the government’s military plans. Everyone must accept military training, enthusiastically enlist in military service, or participate in labor service, to achieve the goal of a nation of soldiers and a nation of workers. All officers and soldiers, especially senior officers, should not be arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. Strict discipline and accomplish the mission. Whether it is the front or the rear, we must follow the plan to make our existing military foundation more substantial, expand our existing achievements, and make our national army stronger and stronger, so that we will win every battle and take every attack. (C) We must support the government's political plan and take the responsibility of promoting local autonomy and implementing the new county system, laying a genuine foundation for the Five-Power Constitution. This is a necessary work to enrich national strength and concentrate people's strength. For the sake of long-term resistance, and the long-term welfare of the nation, it must be strengthened. Especially the leaders of various parties and organizations, the gentry of various provinces, cities, and towns, and the principals and teachers of large, medium, and small schools, their words and deeds are all models for their compatriots, and they must work together to realize the Three Principles of the People as their own responsibility, unite sincerely, and never change until death. (D) We must support the government's economic plan. The capital, technology, and efforts of compatriots at home and abroad must be concentrated, and production and construction in the rear must be accelerated and realized as soon as possible. We must also be extremely hardworking, absolutely frugal, vigorously promote savings, promote cooperative undertakings, avoid hoarding, and eliminate corruption, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and goods can flow smoothly. (E) We must trust and support the government's diplomatic policy. Our diplomacy is one that adheres to justice and reason, and promotes credibility and peace. It has remained unchanged since September 18. Since the start of the War of Resistance on July 7, we have determined that all those who sympathize with and aid us are friendly countries. We have adhered to this central idea as our guiding principle, and it remains unchanged to this day. All our people and soldiers must jointly understand this meaning, support this national policy, cherish themselves, strengthen themselves, fulfill their responsibilities, and make our national policy in the War of Resistance win the respect of the world and live up to the expectations of friendly countries, so as to enhance sympathy, cooperate together, and jointly establish peace in the Far East and the world. Soldiers, compatriots, now is the time when victory is approaching, and it is also the most critical stage of our struggle. We must not forget the ancient teaching of accumulating soil to make a mountain of nine ren. We must understand the principle of fighting harder as we fight. We must endure the current difficulties with a spirit of self-respect and self-confidence. We must break through all difficulties with the determination to succeed or die. We must promote the great power of the Chinese nation from these difficulties, and create lasting happiness for China and all mankind. We unite, we work hard, we persevere, and we will certainly complete the sacred mission entrusted to us by history. (6th dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>The people of the whole country will never forget this and here, we would like to frankly inform our friendly countries of two more important points. First, regarding Japan’s recent threats to the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and Burma to achieve its aims without fighting, our friendly countries must adopt a clear, fair, stern, and resolute attitude toward this, and should collectively plan effective ways to address this. This is an unavoidable responsibility of all friendly countries towards China and the Far East, morally or legally, and it is also an obligation that all friendly countries must fulfill to uphold the future order of the world. As far as China’s position is concerned, if the Japanese army takes any military action in Vietnam or other Asian regions in the future, the Chinese government will not hesitate to use force to deal with it in order to safeguard its own security and to fulfill its consistent principles. Second, although war has broken out in Europe, our two major friendly countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, have not been drawn into the whirlpool of war and still have the power to increase their assistance to China. This is not only the duty of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also their responsibility and right. It is a well-known fact that Japan relies heavily on the United States for its military needs and commerce. The recent enactment of the embargo authorization law by the US Congress shows the demands of US public opinion. If the United States can quickly take decisive measures, and if the Soviet Union and the United States can both increase their aid to China, it will not be difficult to clarify and stabilize the overall situation in the Pacific Ocean soon. Finally, regarding the future of the overall world situation, we would also like to sincerely address a word to the people of friendly countries after reviewing recent events, that is, future efforts should be directed towards gathering countries that love international peace, building a strong international organization, and establishing an effective collective security system. The 455 million Chinese people are eager to work with the insightful people of friendly countries to lay the foundation for lasting world peace in order to improve the well-being of all mankind.

<h3 id="e15">Letter to Comrades: Elucidating the Party's Mission and Commemorating the Premier's Life <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. On the third anniversary of the War of Resistance, the Chairman will issue a letter to all party comrades, stating: "Today marks the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. I, Zhongzheng, look back and forward, filled with myriad emotions. As the Party bearing the responsibility of leadership, we must seize this opportunity to review the past and encourage the future. Therefore, in addition to issuing general letters, I would like to further clarify the mission of our Party and the awareness that each Party member should have, so that we can jointly abide by them and continue our efforts, to live up to the spirits of our Premier and the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the country." What I, Zhongzheng, wish to share with all comrades is nothing other than taking the Premier's aspirations as our own. Throughout his life, the Premier exhausted his energy, running around and appealing, fighting regardless of life, death, success, or failure. His aim was to seek freedom and equality for China. In other words, it was to save the nation and the people from danger. Fifty years ago, the Premier had already foreseen that there would inevitably be a war of self-defense and national salvation today. However, with corrupt governance and a lack of national spirit, once foreign disasters deepened, the country would inevitably be destroyed and the race exterminated. Therefore, he put forth his utmost sincerity, advocated the National Revolution, and called on his compatriots to save themselves together. Furthermore, for the sake of the long-term stability of the country, he believed that all 450 million compatriots must be aware of themselves as masters of the country and jointly fulfill their national responsibilities. The Five-Power Constitution entrusts political power to the people, and he was also concerned that economic development would lead to class divisions, so he advocated equal land ownership and the regulation of capital as a preventive measure. The Premier was the pioneer of the nation, possessing the foresight of the times. With a spirit of great benevolence and courage, he advocated the principle of utmost impartiality and clarity. His basic understanding lay in the absolute reliance on the greatness of national culture for self-defense, as this is the instinct of our people. Revolution is based on the ideal of China. The decline of modern times is solely due to the obscuring of the people's wisdom. If there are people of lofty ideals and benevolence to lead the way, establish models, and inspire and encourage each other, then the national spirit will be vigorously aroused. What achievement cannot be made? What enemy cannot be destroyed? This is also the origin of the Premier's advocacy of the theory of knowing is easy but doing is difficult. To this day, it has become the foundation of the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. Commemorating the greatness of the Premier can be summarized in two phrases: First, selfless; second, fearless. What does it mean to be selfless? Throughout his life, the Premier had only one thought that was pure and sincere: revolution and national salvation. Apart from this, there were no selfish plans or personal views. The Premier dedicated his entire life's energy, time, and life to the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, simply because he could not bear to see them perish and wanted to save them. His purpose was only to seek freedom and equality. From the perspective of human morality, this is utmost impartiality and not selfishness. Why fearless? The Premier absolutely relied on the national spirit, deeply knowing the profound foundation of our nation's inherent morality and intelligence. He firmly believed that once our people awaken and fight, they will definitely develop great strength, destroy all obstacles, and ensure permanent survival. If I revolt myself, who can stop me? If I do not destroy myself, who can destroy me? Because the Premier was fundamentally selfless, he was absolutely fearless. The conclusion drawn from these two phrases is the belief that the nation and the people will surely be saved, and the Three Principles of the People revolution will surely be successful. The only condition is struggle and sacrifice. Understanding this, we can know the mission of our Party. The Premier founded this Party, but he never considered it private. He was not only not private but wanted to overcome the selfishness of society and seek comrades who would abandon private interests and serve the public, to be advocates for the people. Therefore, the Premier taught Party members only one important thing: to struggle and sacrifice for the revolution and national salvation. Loving life and hating death are the most selfish emotions of mankind. The Premier sought comrades who would sacrifice themselves to save the country. Therefore, the basic spirit of our Party is to organize people who share the pure and sincere aspirations of revolution and national salvation, to sacrifice their lives, to serve the country loyally, to arouse the national spirit, and to fight together. This is what the Premier taught us and is also the guarantee on which China relies today to achieve final victory. Since I, Zhongzheng, have served the Premier and dedicated myself to the Party and the country, I have been moved by the Premier's lofty spirit and the greatness of his doctrine, and I have been inspired and resolute. Unfortunately, the Premier passed away prematurely. Fortunately, thanks to the guidance of the loyal elders in the Party, I have been able to work with my comrades to follow the legacy and strive for the cause of revolution and national salvation. Looking back over the past ten years, we have endured hardships and dangers. What we have adhered to in dealing with all revolutionary obstacles is precisely the Premier's great spirit of selflessness and fearlessness, and the absolute belief that national salvation must be achieved and the revolution must be successful. The past ten years have proven that our nation will inevitably respond, and the Premier's reliance on national power is not a concern. Japan, blinded by the strength of our national character and unaware of the greatness of the Premier's doctrine, took advantage of our revolutionary journey and launched a full-scale attack on this day three years ago, resulting in this great war. Now, I, Zhongzheng, reflect on what our Party has done for the country and the people. It is to uphold the legacy, determine national policies, lead Party comrades, inspire national compatriots, and unanimously abide by the legacy of revolution, national salvation, sacrifice, and struggle, and to die for the country. In the three years of arduous struggle, all our armed comrades have strived to be the first to give their lives. Their loyal and heroic deeds have moved the heavens and made the ghosts weep. What is even more inspiring is that since the War of Resistance, the people of the whole country have believed in the Premier's doctrine and admired the Premier's spirit, which has been fully developed. In these three years, the whole country has been under artillery fire and bombing, but our compatriots have been able to endure all kinds of hardships, support the government, and support the Party. This is the victory of our national spirit and the victory of our Premier's Three Principles of the People. It is regrettable that the Party had been in power for nearly ten years before the start of the War of Resistance. Although I, Zhongzheng, was aware of the urgency of foreign threats and was constantly concerned with building national defense, unfortunately, the unification had just been achieved, and there were still many changes, which consumed national strength and delayed the opportunity. Finally, relying on the protection of the nation's righteousness, the foundation of the country was able to remain intact. However, the facilities that I, Zhongzheng, idealized were far away on the day of deciding to fight three years ago. I am saying this now to encourage and reproach myself. I deeply hope that all Party comrades will encourage and reproach themselves, catch up quickly, because the obstacles in the past were ultimately due to the wrong understanding of some comrades, and the Party is responsible for guiding them. Guidance must rely on sincerity, and there is no better way to show sincerity than to set an example. Since the Party bears the heavy responsibility for the rise and fall of the country and the people, and all our compatriots are the objects of the Party's guidance, when obstacles arise, we must reflect on ourselves. All Party comrades should conduct a deep inspection and self-reflection to see if their sincerity is lacking, if their efforts are not enough, if they have truly practiced the oath to serve their duties with the spirit of pioneers, if they have had thoughts of fear and complacency, if they have purged the bad habits of hypocrisy and inertia, if they have completely eliminated public and private words and deeds, and if they are comparable to or have surpassed the non-Party members in the same profession and the same position, and can be their role models. Especially regarding the Party's orders, whether they are thoroughly obeyed and the tasks are completed, regarding the Party's resolutions, whether they are earnestly implemented and efforts are made to achieve them, and regarding the Party's laws and regulations, whether they are faithfully followed and their duties are not neglected. How much of the Party's doctrine has been implemented by us? How much of the Party's policies have been achieved by us? If the doctrine is not implemented, it is due to the disloyalty of the Party members. If the policies are ineffective, it is due to the cowardice of the Party members. Do you know this meaning clearly? Have you ever felt ashamed? All of these important points should be used to ensure that you can reflect on yourself without guilt, so that you can look up without shame. Party comrades should know that revolution and saving the country require Party comrades to spare no sacrifice and redouble their efforts to be pioneers. It is absolutely impossible to think that you have done your best simply because the soldiers of the national army are bravely resisting. I, Zhongzheng, am familiar with the overall situation and believe that the Party's responsibility to guide compatriots will be even greater in the future. Therefore, on the anniversary of the War of Resistance, I first urge all Party comrades to pay serious attention, and I hope that everyone will renew their vows before the Premier's portrait, and that they must take the Premier's aspirations as their own and die for the country, in order to awaken their compatriots to strengthen their efforts. All my comrades should deeply understand the Premier's great spirit of selflessness and fearlessness, and prove the Party's bright and upright mission at all times and in all places. The Party is absolutely one with the country and the people, representing the instinct of national self-defense and seeking the assurance of national independence and national freedom. This is completely different from political parties in other countries that represent the interests of professions, classes, and regions. Therefore, the Party's responsibility for political tutelage is only a necessary initial task for national salvation and national reconstruction. Political power must belong to the entire people and not to the Party. Struggle does not allow for delegation of responsibility, so we must take the lead in undertaking it. Therefore, before the start of the War of Resistance, we did our best to protect the foundation of the country, and what we tried to eliminate were only words and deeds that harmed China and divided China. Apart from this, there was no sectarianism, and there was no selfish governance. The main purpose was to strive for freedom and equality, so as to lay the foundation for the well-being of the nation for generations and to fulfill the revolutionary responsibility. We hope that the people of the country will participate in this effort. This spirit of the Party has achieved great results in the past three years. All my comrades must show their sincerity and strive to carry it out in the future. This is originally a policy that is absolutely supported by our compatriots. As long as we implement it with utmost sincerity, there is no reason why we cannot inspire the whole country. Moreover, I especially hope that my comrades will devote themselves to the revolution, not only touching people with words but also touching people with actions. Every Party member should understand the close relationship between the Party member and the Party, sharing honor and disgrace. Not only should we follow the example of the martyred comrades in dealing with life and death, but also in daily duties and work, and in public and private behavior, we should conduct self-examination and be role models for the people. Therefore, I hope that all my comrades will be able to endure the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure, do the work that ordinary people cannot do, be afraid of not being brave in their work, be afraid of not being humble in their abilities, be afraid of not being strict in their discipline, and be afraid of not being careful in their handling of affairs. At present, the work of resistance and national reconstruction, politics, is more important than military affairs, and construction is more important than combat. All my comrades must delve into various political and economic departments, diligently study academic subjects, intensify their work, strive for efficiency, and cherish every moment. As for providing relief to the dead and wounded, respecting the elderly and caring for the young, and all the work that serves the military and civilians during the war, my comrades should also go deep into the people and strive to put them into practice as role models. Only in this way can we be true followers of the Premier, and the nation will respect us for generations to come. If there are those who are members of the Party but cannot practice the morals that a Party member should have, or are corrupt and negligent and delay work, or neglect their duties, or even engage in corruption and self-interest and do not know how to cherish themselves, then Party discipline will not be lenient. I hope that all comrades serving in Party, government, and military organs at all levels will conduct strict inspections at all times to ensure thorough clarification. All my comrades must conduct self-examination and encourage each other, accept fair criticism, and strive to improve their cultivation and progress. Only by creating can we become healthy Party members, only by being progressive can we shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the revolution, and only by putting it into practice can we implement the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we should not only eliminate the habits of following the old ways and being sluggish in a passive way, and correct our bad public and private lives, but also take a proactive approach, do things quickly and practically, and constantly progress and constantly strive. We should take on what ordinary people find difficult and go where the country needs us most, and create benefits for society and the people at all times and in all places, and then the doctrine can be promoted and policies can be implemented. It must be known that officials are the driving force of the country, and Party members are the vanguards of the people. The Premier's life was a model for our words and actions. Looking back since the Tongmenghui, my Party comrades have sacrificed their lives for the country, no less than hundreds of thousands of people. National justice is focused on the Party, enabling compatriots across the country to believe in the greatness of the Premier's doctrine, trust the Party, and support the Party. This is the great trust shown by the Party and the gift of the martyrs' sacrifices, which should be cherished by the comrades who die later. I firmly believe that all my comrades will abide by this righteousness, not avoid danger in times of crisis, take the lead in the face of difficulties, be diligent and brave, and fight without fail, so that the glory of the Three Principles of the People will surely shine throughout the country. My beloved comrades, let us all take this to heart and put it into practice! (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>Feng Tai Xiang and Others Will All Speak</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Chairman Chiang's letter to friendly nations, which will be broadcast tonight, will summarize the situation of the Sino-Japanese War over the past three years. The letter was drafted by He Yingqin. Starting tomorrow, the broadcast will continue for three days. Feng Zhuxiang, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Song Meiling, Wang Chonghui, and others will all speak, elaborating on their thoughts on the July 7th anniversary of the War. Chairman Chiang's article will be published this afternoon. Minister He's broadcast will be broadcast in five dialects. The "Current Affairs News" commented this morning on the July 7th anniversary, stating that the number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded by the end of last year in the Republic of China had reached 1,464,400. Adding the total for the six months of this year, the total number will reach 1.8 million. Japan used 26 divisions in the first year of the war, 31 divisions in the second year, and has increased to 41 divisions in the third year. Kong Xiangxi also published an article, emphasizing the stability of China's finances. The main reasons are (1) the solid foundation before the war, (2) the abundant harvest of agricultural products in the past three years, (3) the remarkable effectiveness of using urban funds, (4) a large amount of overseas remittances, and (5) the sympathy and assistance given by foreign countries. Minister of Finance Kong mentioned the issue of banknote issuance, saying that since the outbreak of the war, the demand for legal tender has gradually increased. Although the number of banknotes in circulation has increased, the total amount is still insufficient to meet the demand. Minister of Finance Kong then discussed taxation, saying that China's main tax revenues are customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax, all of which have been reduced. Therefore, the central government is using direct taxes as the backbone of China's national taxes. Income tax ranked sixth in national taxes before the war, but now it has jumped to third place. The national debt issued by China after the start of the war totaled 4.7 billion yuan. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>薛西爾 Sends Congratulations to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Chairman of the International Anti-Aggression League, Xue Xier, and the Vice Chairman, Gao Te, recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, saying, "Your country's heroic resistance against aggression for three years is a model for anti-aggressors.

<h3 id="e16">Political Inspection Group Visits Zhejiang for Inspection, Chiang Tingfu Discusses the Inspection Process <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Jinhua correspondence. The head of the Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi group of the Executive Yuan's Political Inspection Group, Chiang Tingfu, members Ni Weiqing, Li Rui, Wu Jingchao, secretary Zhao Hengrong, and others, accompanied by personnel sent by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, arrived in Jinhua on the evening of the 11th of last month. Huang Shaohong, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, sent a representative to welcome them. Chiang and others then visited Chairman Huang and discussed the grain problem in Zhejiang Province for two hours. It was decided that the provincial government would formulate a plan and then ask the central government for assistance, so the difficulties could be resolved. In the evening, they inspected the streets of the city. Xu Xuebin, the magistrate of Jinhua County, also reported on the local situation. Due to the urgency of time, Chiang and others left for Yongkang Fangdang on the morning of the 12th to inspect. They received inquiries from various committee members and department heads of the provincial government,</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Political Situation</p>
<p>In the afternoon, they transferred to Lishui for inspection. On the 13th, they met with Chairman Chen in Fujian and then went to southern Jiangxi to inspect Guangdong and Guangxi. According to an interview with Chiang by the reporter, they left Sichuan on the 15th. The scope of the inspection was originally Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Zhejiang and Fujian were not originally included in the regulations. After arriving in Jiangxi, because Zhejiang and Fujian were not far away, they took this opportunity to temporarily decide to go there and meet with the provincial authorities to discuss issues such as mutual assistance in grain supervision between neighboring provinces. The purpose of this inspection was to adjust local politics and investigate the economic situation of the countryside. Although the situations in each province were different, they were working hard to solve various difficulties. Everything in Hunan and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Has Made Considerable Progress</p>
<p>Especially the improvement of the rural economy and the development of handicrafts in various places have shown a rapid surge. The industries that were originally suppressed by imported goods are also gradually recovering, and the situation is better than before the War of Resistance. In terms of conscription, Anren in Hunan and Guixi in Jiangxi have achieved the best results. For example, the compilation of the roster of strong men is clear, and the preferential treatment of the families of soldiers on expeditions is well-organized, which is commendable. As for the implementation of the new county system, the methods of each province are different. For example, Hunan Province is implementing it in stages. Twenty-three counties will be the first to implement it starting on July 1st. After that, more than twenty counties will be implemented every six months, with the goal of completing it in a few years. Jiangxi Province plans to unify the entire province because the township and village baojia organizations have a better foundation.</p>

<p>Gibraltar, British Territory. The port was bombed by enemy aircraft for the first time this morning before noon. A total of eight bombs were dropped, but they were aimless and all fell into the sea. Therefore, there was no damage to the ground, and there were no civilian casualties. Local anti-aircraft artillery also fired back, and the enemy aircraft fled in panic, apparently flying towards French Algeria in North Africa. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>London. Naval sources here have confirmed that several French warships have indeed sailed into Scottish territorial waters. Several other warships, originally being built in French shipyards, have also been towed across the English Channel. All the workers are on the warships, and whether they will continue to work or be repatriated will be their own choice. Regarding this matter, semi-official sources have commented that British officers and soldiers are all heartbroken about the conflict between British and French warships in Oran, North Africa, firstly, sympathizing with the unfortunate encounters of the French officers and soldiers, and secondly, admiring their spirit of obeying government orders. In addition, the French fleet in Alexandria, Egypt, has expressed its willingness to fight alongside Britain, which is quite commendable. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e20">French Foreign Minister's Speech, Viciously Accusing Britain of Betraying its Friends <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Geneva. French Radio announced yesterday afternoon that Foreign Minister Baudouin delivered a speech to foreign reporters, accusing Britain of betraying France in political and military terms. His words were roughly as follows: "Britain, not France, was the first to declare war on Germany. During the war in the Netherlands and Belgium, and even the war in the Flanders region, Britain was only concerned with defending itself. In fact, Britain never sent its main forces to fight in France. The achievements of the British army in the battle of the Flanders region were merely to carry out a retreat, and its losses were only one-fifth of its expeditionary force. In the battle of the Flanders region, France lost 50% of its troops. The British army was able to escape from the Flanders region entirely thanks to the sacrifices of the French army. The French Navy also shed blood and sacrificed itself everywhere for Britain, covering its navy. However, the reward for France's spirit of selflessness was that the French ships docked in Oran were attacked by the British Navy. At that time, the French military was collapsing and had to sign an armistice with Germany. Britain had no soldiers left in France. Later, General Pétain and I repeatedly explained to Britain that Germany had no intention of asking the French to surrender their warships to join the German fleet to attack Britain. After the armistice agreement was signed, the French government reaffirmed its will on the naval issue to Britain. But in fact, when the French warships were not taking any action, Britain launched an attack without hesitation. The French people were outraged when they heard this." (Reuter dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Geneva. Diplomatic sources here believe that Foreign Minister Baudouin's remarks to journalists confirm France's desire to change its diplomatic policy, to distance itself from Britain and approach the Axis powers. According to Baudouin, Churchill promised on June 13 that if France was forced to negotiate peace alone, Britain would respect the independence of the French Navy. In other words, Churchill went back on his word. Baudouin also said that France had attempted to restore diplomatic relations between Britain and France, but had been unable to do so, indicating that Churchill had been planning to attack the French fleet ten days ago. France believes that since Britain does not hesitate to destroy the friendship between the two countries, France intends to participate in the establishment of a European order, leaving Britain with no foothold.

<p>Rome: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin was kept strictly secret beforehand. There were no farewell ceremonies when he departed from Rome today. The "Stefani News Agency" only released an official announcement several hours after Ciano's departure. It is reported that the German Ambassador to Italy, Dr. Mackensen, and Ambassador Muti, a key official of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied Ciano. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hitler returned to Berlin at 3 PM today, arriving one day earlier than Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. It is rumored that Hitler will hold important discussions with Ciano. Officials deny that these talks involve peace negotiations with Britain, but well-informed sources say, "If this peace agreement equates to a complete German victory, we might consider granting Britain's requests." It is said that Ciano will not return to Rome immediately after his talks with Hitler but will travel elsewhere. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The political circles here are not surprised by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin. It has become customary for key figures from the Axis powers to hold consultations when important decisions are made. In August 1938, before the outbreak of war, Ciano had lengthy talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg and then met with Hitler. After the end of the Polish campaign, on October 6th, when Fuehrer Hitler delivered his speech in the Reichstag proposing peace to Britain and France, Ciano was also in Berlin. This spring, before the German army began the Norwegian campaign, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Rome. A few days later, Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass. Most recently, on June 18th, the two leaders and the two foreign ministers met in Munich to discuss the stance of Germany and Italy in the armistice negotiations with France. Although the itinerary of this visit by the Italian Foreign Minister has not yet been announced, there is no doubt that he will discuss all current political issues with German figures. Political circles believe that the discussions between Germany and Italy will cover approximately the following three areas: (1) Relations between Britain and France, (2) The Mediterranean issue, (3) The issue of Southeastern Europe.

When Hitler arrived in Berlin at 2 PM, all streets from the Halensee train station to the Chancellery were guarded. The German radio station had previously warned residents not to throw flowers at the Fuehrer's car as it passed through the streets of Berlin. All flowers should be placed on the road before the vehicles passed.

<p>London: The British government today took further precautionary measures to deal with any actions that the enemy may take. The Home Office has designated the southern coast, from Hastings in Sussex to a certain location in Dorset, as a coastal defense zone, extending twenty miles inland. It is understood that government authorities will soon issue orders restricting traffic within this coastal defense zone. All residents of the area, unless they have sufficient reason, are prohibited from driving vehicles arbitrarily, so as not to hinder road traffic within the zone. In this regard, the Ministry of Transport will work closely with the Home Office and has authorized local air defense authorities to prohibit "unnecessary" vehicles from traveling on important highways essential for troop movements, and to designate highways that can continue to be used normally, so that residents are fully aware of them. In addition, the Home Office has also issued orders stipulating that all foreign nationals, except for diplomatic and consular personnel, may not possess British maps with a scale larger than 1:750,000. Various travel guides that detail highway and railway traffic conditions within Britain are also prohibited from being kept and must be handed over to the authorities before the 9th of this month. Even British subjects must obtain permission from the authorities before they can keep such books and maps. Libraries everywhere have also been ordered to carefully conceal all detailed maps.

<p>London: The newspapers here did not express much surprise at the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and France. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times" claimed that it was noteworthy that the initial news of the severance of relations between Britain and France did not come from the French side, but was transmitted by the German official news agency yesterday morning. At that time, there was no news from Vichy. The declaration of severance of relations was not issued by Vichy until the evening. The newspaper also mentioned the declaration of German and Italian resentment of Britain's actions against the French fleet. Judging from the remarks made by Germany and Italy, it can be proved that the actions on Wednesday indirectly struck a blow to the enemy's military value. Within the scope of the actions, these two dictators could do nothing but instruct their puppet, Petain, to sever diplomatic ties with Britain. This move was expected. Its main practical effect is to draw a clear line between those in Free France who continue to fight and those who are willing to submit to the aggressors of their country. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington: Germany yesterday delivered a formal note to the United States, rejecting the recent warning issued by the United States to European powers not to interfere in the Western Hemisphere. The State Department announced that it had received the German note at the same time that rumors were spreading that war might break out in the Western Hemisphere, as it was learned that a British cruiser fleet had blockaded the French Martinique Island in the Windward Islands. In rejecting the American warning regarding the Western Hemisphere, the German note stated that Germany had never shown any intention to interfere in the Western Hemisphere or to claim territory in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the United States has no reason to issue a warning. The note also warned that if the American republics hope to gain respect for the principle of non-interference in American affairs by European countries, as explained by the Monroe Doctrine, then the American republics should also not interfere in European affairs. The German note was released by the State Department, along with a commentary by Secretary of State Hull. Hull emphasized that the governments and peoples of Latin America, and undoubtedly most of the rest of the world, fully understand the basic issues involved.</p>
<p>Hull reiterated that the purpose of the Monroe Doctrine is to avoid any aggression against the Western Hemisphere by any non-American power, and at the same time to curb the expansion of any non-American governmental system and countries in the Western Hemisphere. The German note is a formal response to the United States, which shortly before France signed a peace treaty with Germany and Italy, separately sent documents to Britain, France, Germany and Italy. The purpose of the American note was to warn European powers against any attempt to transfer territory in the Western Hemisphere from one European country to another. (United Press, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington: Judging from the general meaning of the public document released by US Secretary of State Hull, Germany refuses to recognize the US interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, deeming it untenable. Hull said that the US government feels that it would not be beneficial to handle this matter with the German government at this time. The United States had previously stated that the United States would not allow land in the Western Hemisphere to be transferred from one European country to another European country. This position of the United States has not changed to this day. Today Hull has reaffirmed this position in his official remarks. The German letter is a reply to the Washington letter of June 18, which stated that the non-interference in American affairs required by the Monroe Doctrine can only have legal effect in principle on the condition that the American countries do not interfere in European affairs. After reading the main points of the German reply, Hull said that the Monroe Doctrine has nothing to do with the fact that certain countries in Europe own land in the Americas, while other European countries do not. The Monroe Doctrine is purely a self-defense policy aimed at maintaining the independence and integrity of the American countries. Hull concluded by saying that although the United States is pursuing a policy of non-participation and non-interference in purely political events in Europe, the United States will continue its cooperation with other countries when its policies make it possible to unite with other countries. Hull's remarks were clearly approved by President Roosevelt. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department announced yesterday that the United States has warned Germany that if any German officials stationed in the United States openly criticize US policies, Germany must dismiss and recall them. It is reported that Berlin sent a note to the United States stating that Germany would only approve of the US Monroe Doctrine if the Americas did not interfere in European affairs, that is, if Europeans did not interfere in American affairs. Furthermore, the German Consul General in New Orleans, Bickelch, stated in an interview with reporters on June 14 that Germany would not forget that the United States was constantly providing military assistance to Britain. For these two reasons, the aforementioned warning was issued after Hull's rebuttal to Germany. (International News Service, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e32">French Martinique Island; London States No Blockade <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Last night, there was fear here that the European war would extend to the Western Hemisphere, because Germany had clearly rejected the Monroe Doctrine. At the same time, it was reported that the British cruiser fleet had completed a blockade line around the French Martinique Island in the Caribbean Sea. French people here are deeply concerned that the French troops in Martinique and the British Navy may start a war at any time. The Martinique authorities support the French Petain government, which signed a peace treaty with Germany and Italy. It is reported that in the days before France surrendered, a large number of American aircraft were shipped to France, and then transferred by French ships to Martinique Island. It is believed here that the British Navy has decided not to let these aircraft fall into the hands of the Germans. For this reason, French people here predict that the British cruiser fleet blockading Martinique Island will enter the island's harbor in the near future. Unconfirmed news said that the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" is currently in Martinique Island, carrying 100 American aircraft, in addition to the ship's original 40 aircraft. It is heard that the "Béarn" sailed from a certain Canadian port on June 17, carrying 100 American aircraft. When Germany and France signed a peace treaty, it evaded and went to Martinique Island. The garrisons in the French overseas territories have all been ordered by the Petain government to attack any British warships entering within 12.5 miles of French territorial waters. It is generally believed that if the British cruiser fleet attempts to search the French ships on Martinique Island, the French garrison on the shore will definitely open fire. French people here are speculating whether Britain will invade Martinique Island and disintegrate the government there that supports the Petain regime. If Martinique Island cannot be placed under blockade, then the island will be an excellent base for German submarines, enough to attack shipping routes between Britain and the United States. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>London: London firmly stated that the Royal Navy has not blockaded Martinique. According to news from French people in Washington, the purpose of this blockade is to prevent a batch of military aircraft from falling into the hands of the Germans. Responsible parties in London said that the Royal Navy is capable of dealing with this situation without having to implement a blockade. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Japan Actively Engaged in Improving; Business with Latin America; Pacific International Institute Survey Report; Established As Many As Seven Commercial Agreements in Half a Year <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco: According to a survey report by the Pacific International Relations Institute, Japan has recently been actively working to improve its commercial relations with Latin America. Since this year, Japan has concluded as many as seven commercial treaties or agreements with various Latin American republics. Japan's commercial "blitzkrieg tactics" in Latin America can be seen in the speed with which treaties are signed. After one treaty is concluded, it is immediately followed by the signing of another. Among this large batch of new treaties, the first to be established was the treaty with Chile. The treaty was signed in January of this year. The agreement stipulates that Japan's annual purchase of nitrates from Chile will increase from approximately 30,000 tons to 70,000 tons. In addition, it can also purchase copper, beans, various vegetables, various dried fruits, and cooking salt. The goods that Japan sells to Chile are ironware, glass, and toys. The second is the commercial agreement with Uruguay, which was signed on February 21 of this year. The agreement stipulates that Uruguay will sell wool, leather, and scrap iron to Japan, and Japan will sell cotton textiles and rayon to Uruguay. The third is the commercial agreement with Argentina, which was concluded on March 15, immediately after the Japanese-Uruguayan commercial agreement. The agreement stipulates that trade between the two countries will increase to 60 million Japanese yen per year, three times more than in 1939. Japan can purchase wool, frozen meat, canned meat, casein, and other products from Argentina. Japan will enjoy favorable exchange rates when exporting chemicals, cotton textiles, steel products, and other manufactured goods to Argentina. Only two days after the signing of the Japanese-Argentine commercial agreement, on March 17, Japan began negotiations with Mexico. The Mexican commercial commissioner went to Tokyo to discuss barter trade agreements and Japanese investment in Mexico. Although a complete commercial treaty has not yet been established, in fact a certain Japanese company has signed a purchase contract worth 3 million Mexican pesos with the Mexican government to purchase Mexican kerosene and gasoline. It is also heard that in order to subsidize Japanese freight costs and Panama Canal tolls, Mexico estimates the price of these items to be extremely low. The commercial agreements and negotiations between Japan and Colombia and Venezuela also focus on oil, because oil is the bulk of these countries' exports and is urgently needed by Japan. Regarding Japan's negotiations with other Central and South American countries, the survey report said, "In the current Japanese commercial offensive, several phenomena have hindered Japan's economic life. These phenomena are interrelated, yet each has its own special characteristics and did not exist before the Sino-Japanese War, such as the European war and Washington's abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty. In terms of these two, Japan is in a dangerous situation, because Japan is very dependent on Britain and the United States, and these two countries are special suppliers of raw materials for Japan, and they are also markets for the sale of goods. Although Latin America has never occupied an important position in Japan's trade, many raw materials, whether in wartime or peacetime, are needed by Japan. These raw materials are all produced in the Great River (Latin American rivers, referring to the Latin American region, for this reason). The expansion of trade between Latin America and Japan is easy, especially after the outbreak of the European war disrupted the normal trade between South America and Europe, the realization of this situation is necessary. However, from a close examination of Japan's side, putting aside its internal difficulties, its desire to gain anything in the near future may not be as desired. Furthermore, a force has existed since 1930 that is sufficient to prevent Japan's trade in Latin America from surpassing that of Europe and the United States. In other words, Japan's inability to develop in South America is due to two obstacles. First, Japan's new industries in Latin America do not have huge investments. Second, it is not easy for Japan to spur Latin America to fully adapt to Japan's needs. (United Press, 6th)</p>

<p>Hyde Park: When President Roosevelt was hosting reporters here, he said that there are five key points that must be realized before lasting peace can be achieved, namely (1) Elimination of fear, which requires disarmament, (2) Freedom of information, the whole country must be able to obtain information on how things are progressing at home and around the world. Therefore, this freedom is very important. If the various tools for disseminating information are not free, there can be no stable world. (3) Freedom of religion, this freedom is well maintained in democratic countries, but not so in other political systems. (4) Freedom of speech, everyone should be free to express their opinions, as long as they do not advocate overthrowing the government. (5) Elimination of desire, this point must be achieved by removing international cultural and commercial barriers. President Roosevelt said that the outline of the above five goals has raised the question of whether the United States will seek these five points, or give them up, or encourage countries that have already given up these five points because no one opposes them, so as to establish more effective governments. He admitted that the totalitarian governments maintained by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are more effective than democratic countries. The US political system has places where things are done too slowly due to the system of checks and balances among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Many Americans are willing to adopt their political systems because totalitarian countries are more efficient. This is what he is depressed about. Although there are many such people, they are not the majority in the country. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Soviet Union Opposes Blockade of Yunnan-Burma Transportation; British Reply to Japan to be Delivered <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>London: Well-informed sources have stated that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, has informed Britain that the Soviet Union will strongly oppose the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road. The British Foreign Office will cite the Soviet Union's opinion to reject Japan's demands. It is also believed that the British reply will be delivered to Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Craigie, within the next two days. The reply will likely contain simple phrasing, stating that the issue involves other countries, and therefore the British government cannot comply with the request to block the Burma Road. Reliable sources also indicate that the British reply will point out that non-military goods are also transported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is believed that Japan's request to blockade Hong Kong's transportation will be ignored, as this route is practically non-existent. Reliable sources also stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov told British Ambassador Cripps that the Soviet Union strongly opposes any action that weakens China's resistance. Molotov also said that in addition to transporting goods to China via Xinjiang, Soviet goods are also often transported to China via Burma. Therefore, the Soviet Union must have a say in the fate of the Burma Road. Although Britain is eager to seek a peaceful resolution with Japan, it is unwilling to sacrifice China's interests, especially at this critical time in British-Soviet relations. Britain does not want to undermine the improvement of British-Soviet relations. When Britain discussed Japan's demands with Australia and New Zealand, it also consulted with the United States and exchanged views with the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources said that Britain may ask Japan to discuss the matter directly with the United States, as the issue also involves American interests. (United Press, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Intense Battle in the United Cup Basketball Tournament; Paramount Defeats Shanghai Youth; Shanghai Youth Lacks Stamina in 66-43 Match; Exciting Battle Between Liangxi and Qifan Today <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>In the first round of the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, the two giants of Group A, Paramount and Shanghai Youth, had their first encounter. Both sides had strong players, well-organized lineups, and evenly matched strengths. After the dissolution of Hualian, Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan joined Paramount, while Shen 　Gong, Ren Xiangcheng, and Chen Xuechong played for Shanghai Youth. Former teammates became opponents, so the battle was inextricably linked. The first half was especially tense, with the difference always within a few points. Unfortunately, Shanghai Youth lacked stamina, resulting in a sharp decline. As a result, the score was 66-43, with the first half being 29-22. Because the competition was too intense, the actions were inevitably excessive, which was also a drawback. In terms of performance, Paramount was definitely better. Yesterday, the Paramount court was completely surrounded, and it was very lively. The band of the Orphans' Training Institute also performed to add to the excitement. In the opening game, Shangxing played against Xihua. Shangxing took the lead, taking a 14-6 lead in the first half. After the exchange, Xihua counterattacked, catching up and tying at 21 each. Shangxing finally relied on Zhuang Kunpeng's remote shot to hit the target, and the time ended, so they won with 23-21. However, there was a question of whether one of the balls was hit, and it is said that the Xihua team may file a protest.</p>
<p>Paramount Comes From Behind</p>
<p>The main battle began, Zhang Shaoqing of Paramount scored four points with two free throws. Sun, Shen, Li, and Ren of Shanghai Youth built successively, surpassing the other side with 11-5 momentum, and the Paramount men responded calmly. Relying on Li Zhenzhong's wonderful shot, they forced equalizing at 15 each. Yu Gong and Xue Chong of Shanghai Youth both shot from left and right, still maintaining the leading position. Zhenzhong and Xianglong of Paramount then hit the net, first surpassing the other team with 20-19. Yu Gong then shot the other team on his way back. With a aerial penalty by Da Mao, Shanghai Youth once again was in a leading position. However, when Shanghai Youth was on top of its glory, its players slacked, and Zhang Shaoqing of Paramount went off to rest and then Bao Songyuan came on, and the team's momentum changed significantly. They scored more than nine points in a row. On the other hand, Shanghai Youth did not gain anything at all in the more than six minutes of this. From then on, Paramount's victory was basically confirmed. As the first half came to an end, Paramount got 29 points, and Shanghai Youth got 22 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Youth Can't Save the Situation</p>
<p>After the exchange, Paramount still played with the original lineup, while Shanghai Youth brought Li Zude instead of Yu Dehai. Li Zhenzhong first showed off his shooting skill, and Chen Xuechong immediately responded. Sun Da Mao shot twice at the side, and Shanghai Youth was about to revive. Fortunately, Bao Songyuan and Chen Xianglong both took pearls on the team to try to curb Shanghai Youth from having the opportunity to raise its head again. Zhang Shaoqing soon came back on the front line, and Paramount's offensive became sharper. From 36-32, Paramount went on to have Zhenzhong, Songyuan, and Shaoqing scored, especially Bao Songyuan, who became even more active, suddenly increased by ten points, and the score became 46-36, with a difference of ten points. From then on, Shanghai Youth's morale seemed to have been greatly discouraged, and the team was unable to revive. Paramount took over the victory, changed to Zhou Zhi to play. Nian Hua and Songyuan were brilliant, and in the last ten minutes, the people saw nothing but Paramount's dominating the game. With the long whistle, Paramount won with 66-43.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Student Summer Work—Written for the Newspaper's Summer Essay Contest for Middle and High School Students <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>—Shen Tilan</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is a famous educator and specially wrote this article for the newspaper's summer essay contest for middle and high school students. Mr. Shen believes that middle and high school students, whether or not they participate in summer school or summer camps, should focus on collective research, collective service, collective sports, and other operations suitable for the times. This newspaper believes that the results and experiences of research, service, and sports are excellent materials for writing. We hope that all students will follow Mr. Shen's suggestions, do it practically, and complete the essay contest entries. The summer vacation is coming to an end, and the articles submitted should be wonderful. —The Editor</p>
<p>Summer vacation is the longest holiday of the year for schools. When students arrive at the summer vacation, the question arises of how to spend the holiday.</p>
<p>In recent years, students in middle and above schools have felt interested in using summer work and have made various attempts. This is a good phenomenon, but in general, students only pay attention to spending the holiday and have not grasped the center of summer work, which is still a regret.</p>
<p>Summer work, of course, should be devoted to the cultivation of personal physical and mental health and the preparation for further education and employment, but it is not enough to start from a personal standpoint alone. In the great era of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, young people should do something that contributes to the country and the nation. This is the most central topic of student summer work.</p>
<p>The most common summer work for students is to join summer students. Their purpose is often to make up for credits or tutor failed subjects. This can be considered beneficial work, but most of these students usually do not work hard enough and have slightly worse grades, and they want to find a way to remedy it in the summer. The motivation is not very pure. Moreover, the summer school is short, and students are mostly perfunctory, only seeking to complete the term and be able to make up for credits. They do not care about other ideological research and life training. Such a summer school has almost become a prison for lively and promising young people. It is definitely not a suitable summer work for students. As for an ideal summer school, in addition to setting up important subjects, teachers and students should teach and learn earnestly, and there should be suitable books and experimental equipment, especially various extracurricular operations suitable for the times. This is the first point of student summer work.</p>
<p>The student summer camps or summer camps promoted by the YMCA over the years have attracted many ambitious and active young people, especially Christian believers. There is spiritual practice, lectures, discussions, labor, sports, and friendship. It is a collective training for the average development of life in many aspects. In terms of educational significance, it is a very progressive facility. Unfortunately, it only limits the recruitment of some students and cannot popularize the public. In recent years, other agencies and groups have also begun to hold summer camps or summer camps, but they lack the excellent traditions and achievements of Christianity and are not very good. We hope that all students who have the opportunity to participate in this year's YMCA summer camp or summer camp should not easily let go of the summer camp, and pay more attention to various operations suitable for the times. If possible, its scope should be expanded to give more students the opportunity to participate.</p>
<p>For students who do not participate in summer school and summer camps, or who have joined but still have some free time, it is possible to combine several young comrades to do various collective work. These groups only need a simple center of interest, whether it is research, sports, or service. The important thing is that the work is carried out regularly and without interruption. As for the location, it is best to find a way to borrow school buildings. Otherwise, it can only be held in students' homes in turn. However, although these groups do different jobs, everyone should have a common goal of recognizing the times and sharpening their ambitions. Otherwise, there will be a danger of falling behind and corruption. As for service-oriented work, the most convenient are popular schools and voluntary schools. Students often like to travel during the summer vacation. Since the War of Resistance, many young people have thought of going to the interior, but the travel expenses are quite expensive now. Except for those who have decided to go to the interior for further education and employment, they can go and do not have to come back. The rest can only go to the eastern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu areas nearby, which is relatively economical. But it is just a superficial look and does not have much meaning. It is best to have the introduction of relatives and friends to get some temporary work or training. We have absorbed the air of freedom in the interior and then returned to the isolated island, which can make our vision farther, our will firmer, and our courage more majestic. We are equipped to bear the arduous tasks in this great era.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Three Years Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident: Silent Commemoration by All Circles in Shanghai; Cessation of Entertainment to Mourn the Martyred Soldiers and Civilians; Strict Precautions Taken by Concession Authorities <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Today marks the third anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. As designated by the Central Government as the War of Resistance and Nation-Building Commemoration Day, all circles in Shanghai will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. However, they will all silently commemorate the day with a spirit of perseverance and voluntarily cease entertainment and banquets to mourn the martyred soldiers and civilians. As the severe winter is approaching rapidly, all circles believe that the troops and refugees need to be provided with winter clothing and bedding in advance. Therefore, they have initiated the "Early Winter Clothing Donation Campaign" to prepare. The authorities of the two concessions are implementing special strict precautions throughout the day today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Full Mobilization of Defense Troops, Corps, and Police</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, all police officers from various police stations, and reserve special constables have been fully mobilized to participate in today's special precautions. The curfew before "July 7th" has been intensified since the evening of the day before yesterday, and last night it was specially extended from 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM. The British and American troops stationed in the Public Concession have also been ordered to begin deployment this morning. It is reported that the French troops stationed in the French Concession have also been deployed. In addition to deploying troops to guard key locations in their respective defense areas, patrol teams have been formed to conduct patrols. These stationed troops, together with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession and the French Volunteer Corps of the French Concession, total more than 10,000 armed personnel deployed for precautions. With such a strong force, public security is definitely assured.</p>
<p>Strict Searches at Transportation Hubs</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have also internally decided to start using barbed wire to block roads after 11:00 PM last night. Roads such as Zhubao San Road, Sanyangjing Bridge, Shandong Road, Hubei Road, Yunnan Road, Chongqing Road, and Chengdu Road at the junction of the two concessions on Avenue Edward VII have all begun to be blocked or are preparing to be blocked. However, major transportation hubs such as the Bund, Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Daxin Street, Yu Qiaqing Road, Ma Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Hart Road, and Haig Road will retain narrow openings for vehicles and pedestrians, but strict searches will be conducted as usual.</p>
<p>Special Precautions Limited to Today</p>
<p>In addition, special precautions will be taken and appropriate closures will be implemented along the concession border areas, such as the area along Route Ghisi and Haig Road in the Western District, as well as the bridges along the Suzhou Creek in the Northern District, leaving only necessary passages. It is also rumored that the iron gates along the Sino-French border at the southern end of the French Concession will be temporarily closed. Pedestrians entering the concession along the wharves on the Huangpu River on the eastern border will also be subject to strict searches. It is also learned that the two concessions will conduct large-scale searches of public places such as hotels, apartments, tea houses, and printing houses, and have been under invisible martial law since 6:00 PM last night. The deployment time for defense troops and volunteer corps is from 5:00 AM this morning to 11:00 PM tonight, but it may be extended or shortened as appropriate depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Publishing Announcements to Encourage Compatriots</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a letter to all citizens today, commemorating the third anniversary of the War of Resistance, expressing appreciation for the perseverance and efforts of all circles in maintaining their positions and moving forward in the difficult environment. The Two-Road Party Headquarters, the Seamen's Party Headquarters, and the Three Principles of the People Youth League have also issued announcements to encourage compatriots.</p>

<h3 id="e62">French Concession Police Conduct Large-Scale Searches; Nothing Found <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, French Concession police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to Zhaolu Fang at the intersection of Rue Massenet and Route Paul Beau, as well as Gengyu Li and Xinping Apartments on Route Paul Beau, and Dayi Apartments, etc., for strict inspections. After a long time, nothing was found.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the French Concession police dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the YMCA on Rue de Montigny at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to search. As a result, nothing was found, and they immediately withdrew. From 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM in the evening, the Wenzhou Hotel in the Lafayette Apartments on Route Lafayette was also searched once. Subsequently, small inns on nearby Rue Cardinal Mercier and Route de Grosse were also searched for a long time. It is reported that nothing was found.</p>
<h3 id="e63">British, American, and French Ambassadors to Discuss Concession Situation in Shanghai; American Ambassador to Come to Shanghai from Chongqing <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese-language "Continental News" reported yesterday (the 5th) that the U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, will come to Shanghai from Chongqing to meet with British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme, who have recently returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. It is expected that the diplomatic situation in Shanghai may soon see new developments. The three ambassadors will hold talks in Shanghai to study issues related to the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. It is reported that after the British and French ambassadors arrived in Shanghai in early June, they originally planned to go to Beidaihe for summer vacation as usual, but due to the sudden changes in the European situation, especially France's surrender to Germany and Italy, the future of the two concessions in Shanghai has become complicated, and they were forced to postpone their trip to North China.</p>
<h3 id="e64">British Ships Between Shanghai and Vietnam Have Suspended Navigation; Defense Forces in French Territories Ordered to Fire on British Ships <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported this (the 6th) morning that the British Consul in charge of navigation affairs in Shanghai has recently ordered British ships sailing between Shanghai and Vietnam not to sail to the French colony. British officials in the city admitted that this order has been issued, but said that this decision by the British authorities is only a temporary measure and should not be taken too seriously. It is because a Washington dispatch this morning stated that the defense forces in French overseas territories have been ordered to open fire on any British ships entering within 12.5 miles of French territory.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Both Affected</p>
<p>The British trading firms Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire, which maintain regular shipping services between Shanghai and Haiphong, are most affected by this order. The interruption of British shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is another unfavorable development for Shanghai trade. In the first half of this year, imports to the city from Vietnam accounted for 7% of the total. Most of the rice and coal transported to Shanghai come from Vietnam. From January to May this year, Shanghai imported goods from Vietnam totaling 7.7 million gold units, of which rice accounted for 4.4 million gold units and coal accounted for 2.7 million gold units. According to Shanghai customs records, Shanghai's exports to Vietnam in the same five-month period were only 5.1 million yuan, accounting for 1% of the city's total exports. However, a large amount of Shanghai-made goods transported to Hong Kong are often transshipped to Vietnam, mostly cotton cloth and silk made in Shanghai. A large amount of Chinese paper, machinery, miscellaneous items, and steel are also often transported to Vietnam for sale.</p>
<p>Status Quo of Concession Situation Maintained</p>
<p>The sudden deterioration of British-French relations has caused quite a stir among the general public. The diplomatic authorities of the two countries in Shanghai have so far made no statement on this issue. As for the future of the Shanghai concession situation, it was said yesterday by those familiar with the international situation that it should not be affected in any way. The neutral nature of the Shanghai concession has been determined, and the authorities in Shanghai can coexist peacefully and avoid friction even among warring countries. Even if Britain and France break off diplomatic relations, they should be able to understand the difficult situation in Shanghai and do their best to maintain it to avoid giving others an excuse.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Waterways Have Been Mined</p>
<p>According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong Naval Intelligence Department has notified shipping companies to pay attention to minefields and other dangerous waterways: (1) Isolated minefields, in the area of West Lamma Channel and from Castle Peak to Chu Liu Kok. Under no circumstances should ships of any size approach this area. The boundaries of this area are marked with red flags and lighted buoys. (2) Controlled minefields, in the area of East Lamma Island and Tai Long Channel. No ships are allowed to anchor or fish. Wooden ships may pass through this area unless prohibited by patrolling warships. Steel ships may only enter this area with special permission from the naval authorities. Small steel ships traveling to and from Joss House Bay are allowed to pass through the northeast corner of the Tai Long Channel area, but must travel close to Chau Tsai. The area has been properly arranged to allow ocean-going ships to pass through, but yachts are not allowed to pass through. (3) Submarine obstruction. Small ships should not risk passing through this obstruction. The eastern end of the obstruction area has an entrance for small ships to pass through. The water depth is 10 feet 6 inches, whether the tide is rising or falling. The main entrance is marked with two symbol ships, which are specially for ocean-going ships to pass through. (4) Fat Tong Mun. The waterway has been closed with non-explosive materials to a depth of about 2 feet 6 inches. Small ships can pass through, but they are responsible for any danger. (5) Chu Liu Kok. Ships registered in Hong Kong can pass through the eastern waterway of Chu Liu Island, but they are responsible for any danger. When sailing in this area to within two miles east or west of Chu Liu Kok, they must sail close to Lantau Island, about one mile away, to avoid approaching the closed area of Castle Peak and Chu Liu Kok. (6) Liability for loss. The naval authorities are not responsible for any danger or loss. The managers of the ships should be responsible for the safety of their ships.</p>
<p>"Tai Sang" Ship Only Sails to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have now been ordered to stop all ships bound for Haiphong to avoid attacks. In fact, no ships will sail to Haiphong thereafter. The voyage will be decided again depending on the development of the situation. Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Taiyuan" ship is scheduled to sail to Shantou and Hong Kong on the 8th, carrying only passengers and suspending cargo transportation. The company's "Sichuan" ship sailed on the 5th. The ship normally sails the Shanghai-Haiphong route, but due to the current situation, it has been decided to sail to Hong Kong only. It is reported that some other smaller ships may continue to travel between Hong Kong and Annam. Jardine Matheson's "Tai Sang" ship, which normally sails between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong, had just left Shanghai for Haiphong at noon on the 4th, carrying more than 100 passengers. Due to the sudden outbreak of the British-French incident, it was ordered to change its course to Hong Kong. All passengers will disembark in Hong Kong, and those who do not wish to stay in Hong Kong will be returned to Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's "Yu Sang" ship is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow and will stop in Shanghai for one night before changing its course to Hong Kong. The two companies have also stipulated that passenger tickets will no longer be sold to women and children in Shanghai who are going to Hong Kong because Hong Kong is evacuating women and children.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Cargo Transportation Becomes More Frequent</p>
<p>In the past week, the cargo from Haiphong on the ships of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson was not unloaded and was carried back on the original ships. It is reported that all merchants have decided to transship the cargo to Ningbo by Shanghai-Ningbo ships and then go to the mainland. Therefore, Shanghai-Ningbo cargo transportation has been frequent in recent days. Every ship leaving the port is very crowded with passengers and cargo. There are currently more than ten ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo. Tomorrow, the "Shan Tai" ship of the Zhengde Company and the "Rui Tai" ship of the Hualun Foreign Company will set sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo.</p>

<p>The French Concession Fire Department released its work summary for June yesterday, as follows: The department extinguished 34 fires in June, five of which used five hoses, and one used six hoses. At the same time, the department's special team rescued a drowning person from the Huangpu River opposite the French Consulate last month and rescued a Chinese person who had been electrocuted. The department's technical department inspected 256 designated restricted buildings, 96 temporary buildings, and 44 large buildings. Ambulances transported patients to various hospitals 200 times.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Rice Market Price Limit Announcement Announced by the Rice Evaluation Committee; Low-Price Sales and Foreign Rice Subscription Are Being Prepared <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee announced to the rice shops and teahouses yesterday morning: "This committee was announced to be established on the 5th of this month, and it has been resolved that from the 6th of this month to September, the market price of various foreign rice will be temporarily based on the price announced by the Bean and Rice Industry Association on the 2nd of this month as the highest price. It is only allowed to operate below this price and not exceed the limit. If any black market activity occurs, it will be reported immediately and severely punished. The market price after the 10th of this month will be evaluated on the 9th and announced again."</p>
<p>Low-Price Sales Measures</p>
<p>It is learned that the fourth phase of low-price sales is scheduled to be implemented on the 16th of this month, and 60 member companies of the Rice Shop Industry Association will still be entrusted to handle it. In order to actively carry out this work, the association has ordered foreign rice from abroad. The first batch of 20,000 bags and the second batch of 40,000 bags have already been shipped and will arrive at the port around the start of the low-price sales. If the foreign rice does not arrive at the port in time for the low-price sales, the association will first start with the 15,000 bags of rice left over from the previous sales. When the scheduled rice continues to arrive, it will be connected. If the stored rice has been sold out and the scheduled rice has not arrived, it will be suspended for a few days. As for the temporary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees originally scheduled to be held by the Rice Shop Industry Association on the 8th of this month to discuss low-price sales, it is learned that the association has postponed it to around the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Subscription</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Adjustment Association has been working hard for six months and has been deeply trusted by people from all walks of life, who have actively participated and subscribed in large quantities, totaling nearly 50,000 bags. It has made a considerable contribution to the relief of the food panic in the city. Yesterday, the association briefly reported on the actual work situation in the past few months and revised the foreign rice subscription method. The main points are as follows: (1) Groups, organizations, companies, and factories wishing to subscribe to foreign rice should go to the association's office (Room 302, 3rd Floor, YMCA, Eight Immortals Bridge, telephone 84040) to obtain an application form, fill it out according to the format, and submit it with the signature and seal of the responsible representative to the Jiangxi Road Jin City Bank Trust Department, the collection agency designated by the association, and pay a deposit of 40 yuan per bag of foreign rice. Obtain a receipt issued by the association. The collection agency should fill in the receipt number on the application form, indicate that the deposit has been received, and submit it to the association every day. (2) The minimum amount of subscription for each company each time is 50 bags. (3) Subscribers may not cancel or increase or decrease the amount they have subscribed. (4) The type of foreign rice to be subscribed will be decided by the association on its behalf, and the number of bags will also be increased or decreased in proportion to the actual number of subscriptions. (5) The association will deliver the originally packaged foreign rice when the goods arrive, and will not be responsible for the quality of the subscription or the weight loss caused by transportation, drying, breakage, leakage, or corrosion. (6) The association will insure the foreign rice subscribed on its behalf, but if the goods are damaged due to force majeure, the association will not be responsible except for the insurance company's responsibility. (7) The association is not responsible for the delayed arrival or non-arrival of the foreign rice subscribed on its behalf. (8) The storage fee, loading and unloading fee, transportation fee, insurance fee, interest, and other expenses required for the foreign rice subscribed on its behalf will be determined by the association and borne by each subscriber.</p>
<p>Profiting from Speculation</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Ningbo Low-Price Sales Donation Solicitation Conference yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing incidentally expressed his opinion on the food situation in the city, saying that speculative merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard goods and seek huge profits, making a profit of up to 15 yuan per bag of foreign rice. Rice is related to people's livelihood, and a profit of two or three yuan per bag is already heaven-defying. It is hoped that speculative merchants will be inspired by their conscience and take the people's food as the priority.</p>
<h3 id="e67">New Pacific Hurricane Continuing to Advance <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the position of the hurricane at 6:00 AM yesterday was at 20 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 60 nautical miles and was still advancing rapidly in a northwesterly direction. According to the reported position, it was about 180 nautical miles southeast of Luzon. The observatory is now watching the development of its journey. In addition, since the 5th, the tide in the Huangpu River has suddenly risen, with a quantity of more than 11 feet, and it will not be able to recover until after the 9th. The autumn tide next month is even more worthy of attention.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Chapelee Reports to Superiors: Postal Difficulties; Shanghai-Europe Mail Transportation Hindered; Parcel Post to Northwest Suspended <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Shanghai Postmaster, Chapelee, went to Kunming at the beginning of last month to report the postal situation here to the General Administration, and will stay in Kunming for ten days before returning to Shanghai. After arriving in Kunming, Chapelee immediately reported to his superiors that after the intensification of the European War, the postal services between European countries and Shanghai have been greatly affected. Furthermore, the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam has added another obstacle to the post office. Now, the parcel post business between Shanghai and the northwestern provinces of China has been completely suspended. Efforts to rebuild this business have not been successful, and transportation from Shanghai to the mainland via Ningbo is extremely difficult due to poor roads and lack of proper facilities.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Summary of Important News <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The messengers of Reuters in this city demanded that the company accept and agree to pay a rice subsidy of 30%. Messengers with a monthly salary of less than 23 yuan will be given a salary increase. However, the percentage of the increase has not yet been announced. The labor side is satisfied, and all resumed work on the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>Zhu Peisong, Chai Youkang, Zhou Zhisheng, Wang A'gen, and other four foremen of the Hualun Foreign Company's "Rui Tai" ship in this city were arrested at the port of Ningbo on the 2nd of last month by the local defense headquarters on suspicion of being involved in politics. After the company authorities provided a guarantee to the Ningbo authorities, they were released the day before yesterday and have arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Japanese Side's Proposed White Russian Organization Stillborn; General Russian Community Pleased Upon Hearing the News <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Japanese authorities in this city had carefully formulated a plan to organize a new organization under their wings to manage the White Russians, with strong political overtones, so as to impose a "new order" on the more than 25,000 White Russians in Shanghai. It is learned that this plan has failed.</p>
<p>According to sources in charge, senior Japanese officials in Shanghai, after considering this issue for more than a month, decided not to approve the previously planned "Shanghai White Russian Immigrant Association," which contained many White Russians of questionable origins and reputations. It is reported that the existing "White Russian Immigrant Committee" in Shanghai, which manages White Russian affairs, is threatened by the new "Association." Members of the committee are very satisfied to hear the news that the new "Association" will be stillborn. However, they themselves have not received the same news. Mr. Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this city, said, "This matter is still under consideration." The general White Russian community in Shanghai is relieved to hear this news and hopes that the news is true because they are deeply afraid that once the "Association" is established, it will follow the precedent of Harbin and Tianjin and use "anti-communism" as a guise to oppress and extort, or even kill, White Russian immigrants. Shanghai is now the only city in China where White Russians can live freely. Since the new "Association" has failed, the White Russians in this city can continue to enjoy civil life under the current committee led by Mr. Meitzi.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market to Be Reorganized Starting Today; First-Class Goods to Be Used; Foods for Foreigners Also Sold <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>In order for residents in the concession to be able to purchase food at a lower price than the current market price, the French Municipal Council has reorganized the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market. It is now scheduled that from July 7th, each stall in the market will always have goods for foreigners, and the quality of the goods and the hygiene of the vegetable market will be strictly supervised. An agreement has been reached with various importers of livestock and seafood to ensure that the goods in the vegetable market are of the first-class quality. In addition to the meat stalls, fish stalls, egg, chicken, and duck stalls, vegetable stalls, fruit stalls, ice stalls, and flower stalls, there are also foreign shops selling bread and groceries. The vegetable market has convenient transportation. Trolleys on Route 1, Route 2, Route 7, and Route 10, trolleybuses on Route 17 and Route 18, and buses on Route 21 and Route 22 all go directly to the market. Therefore, it is hoped that Chinese and foreign residents will jointly promote the development of the reorganization of the vegetable market so that the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market can become a food supply center and be comparable to other major vegetable markets in Shanghai. It would be fortunate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association plans to hold group whole-life insurance. It was previously submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and approved by the association to decide on its own. If a majority approves, it can be implemented. According to lawyer Zhang Li, a member of the association, the principle of group insurance is very much in favor, but there are still some amendments to be made to the outline: (1) If a member dies, regardless of whether the cause of death is natural or accidental, compensation should be paid uniformly to meet the purpose of the association holding group whole-life insurance. (2) There should be a distinction for members who withdraw from the association. Except for those who are subject to criminal punishment or withdraw from the association due to disciplinary action and are not refunded the insurance premium, those who are transferred to serve as officials or voluntarily transfer should be refunded their insurance premium. At present, some members have temporarily joined due to the extraordinary circumstances. When order is restored in the future, they should return to their original place to practice law. (3) Although it is rare for the insurance premium to exceed the insured amount, it cannot be said that it is non-existent. Therefore, generous interest should be given to the extra insurance premium paid. However, this is a personal opinion and can be amended in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Dissatisfaction with Pension: Senior Police Officers Request Departure; Reportedly, Inspector and Police Superintendent Also Resign; Public Works and Fire Department Personnel Also Plan to Retire <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language North-China Daily News, it has recently come to light that approximately four Western police officers in the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, dissatisfied with the pension issue, have reportedly submitted their resignations. Among the more important officers are the well-known Inspector Ross, as well as several police superintendents and deputy superintendents. An SMC spokesperson stated this morning that they had not officially received news of the resignations, but that it was possible. They said that at the moment they could not comment on this. It is reported that Inspector Ross submitted his resignation on July 1st, and the others resigned around the same time. They all feel dissatisfied because the SMC is unwilling to guarantee police officers' pensions. Furthermore, employees of the SMC's Public Works Department and Fire Department are also dissatisfied, and some have submitted their resignations, although their number is smaller than that of the resigning police officers. According to an SMC employee, the SMC should thoroughly investigate this matter to seek a satisfactory solution. If the pension issue sees no progress, then within the year, perhaps more than one hundred employees will submit their resignations.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a man riding in a rickshaw near the entrance of Zhaofeng Garden was suddenly intercepted and robbed by several thieves. As Jing'an Temple Police Station officers and plainclothes detectives were patrolling nearby, they immediately stepped forward to make arrests.

Some even stood on the French Concession side, implementing special precautions. The situation seemed quite tense, and residents felt alarmed. However, someone who entered Fangbang Bridge from Nanyang Bridge, passed through Minguo Road, Jing Road, Jiumudi, Fuyou Road, and exited Xinbei Gate at 9:00 AM did not see Japanese soldiers searching or making arrests. Starting at 11:00 AM, the aforementioned sentry posts suddenly implemented temporary special martial law, cutting off traffic for ninety minutes before resuming. The Japanese soldiers at the sentry posts also gradually withdrew.</p>

Therefore, they have been given a deadline of five days to relocate to other places to operate, or they will be closed down again. Yesterday was the deadline. Yesterday, a reporter from Huaguang News Agency learned that the gambling dens had automatically ceased operations yesterday afternoon. The so-called Entertainment Relief Association has also been disbanded at the same time, and all employees have been paid half a month's salary.</p>

<p>In the Hongkou area, the Japanese army has been forcibly administering injections, and people entering and exiting Hongkou must carry a vaccination certificate, which must be renewed every three months. Precautions are very strict. However, on the 3rd, a coolie named Liang in Chaoyang Road contracted cholera and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the Japanese authorities disinfected the patient's residence and sent the family to the hospital for examination. It is reported that two young children were found to have bacteria on their bodies. Chaoyang Road was closed to traffic, and door-to-door injections were carried out, and the surrounding residences were disinfected.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Claim for Guaranteed Debt: Issue of Debt Amount Arises; Defendant Yu Zhewen's Lawyer Defends <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yaqiu, the owner of Maochenghao at No. 5 Rongshou Lane, 6th Malu, Public Concession, a native of Jiangyin, recently hired a lawyer to file a suit with the Special First Court, suing Yuankang Clothing Store at No. 270 Kaige Road, Xujiahui Road, and Zhou Quanjii Printing Factory at No. 14 Haikou Road, Dongxin Bridge, seeking compensation for a guaranteed debt of 1,000 yuan. The Special First Court has issued summonses.</p>
<p>The case was transferred to the Special First Court due to lack of jurisdiction. Yesterday, the case was heard by Judge Gui Yu. The plaintiff's lawyer, Tang Renlian, stated that the two defendants guaranteed a debt of 1,000 yuan for Xiejihang in Shengang Town, Jiangyin. Because the debt could not be collected, he requested that the court order the defendants to repay the debt. The defendants, Wu Kang Clothing Store and Zhou Quanjii, jointly hired Yu Zhewen and Gu Peilun as their lawyers.</p>
<p>They appeared in court and argued that the contract submitted by the plaintiff was entered into by Fuji and Xieji. The subject of the lawsuit has obvious problems. Moreover, according to the debt amount submitted by the plaintiff, the amount in the mediation statement was 2,111.20 yuan, while the amount in the complaint was 2,377.30 yuan, which clearly shows that the amount of the debt he submitted</p>
<p>is not accurate. Moreover, according to the principal debtor's letters to the introducer, there were many disputes between the two parties regarding the accounts. Moreover, the defendant did not waive the right of prior action in the guarantee contract. The court ruled that the truth could not be ascertained without the principal debtor appearing in court, and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e83">A Refugee's Lawsuit: Beaten by Shelter Staff; Writes Petition and Appeals for Relief <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Now there is a refugee, Jiang Shihai, who spends his days in the shelter, but because he was beaten and humiliated by the staff of the shelter, he has lost his place to rely on. The staff of the shelter have already been fined by the court. Jiang Shihai is not satisfied, so he wrote a petition to appeal and requested to re-enter the shelter in order to receive relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Relief: To the esteemed Editor-in-Chief: I, Jiang Shihai, am from Bishan County, Jiangsu Province. I took refuge here to escape the Sino-Japanese War. I originally rented a loft to live in, but later, due to insufficient funds, I was admitted to the refugee shelter run by the Renji Shantang thanks to Mr. Chen Heqin. I am often bullied and beaten by the staff, as if I were living in hell. On May 9th, I filed a complaint with the Haining Road Police Station. The police station immediately arrested the staff of the Xin Yamen refugee shelter, handcuffed them, and wanted to deal with them. Later, the defendants asked Renji Shantang (No. 35 Yunnan Road) to send Xu Qisong and others to find a way to bail them out. After I filed a complaint with the police station, I was not allowed to enter the refugee shelter. Because of this, I have no food or lodging, and there is no one to turn to for help. I am about to die on the street. Please publish all the details of my situation in the newspaper and request social relief. With respect, Jiang Shihai.</p>
<p>Appeal: Appellant: Jiang Shihai, No. 10, Lane 219, Shandong Road, Ningbo Road. Appellees: Chen Zhonghua (head of the management department and chief regional officer of the Ciyuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road), Hu Kegen (chief inspector), Xiao Rong (head of the general affairs department). Being dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, the appellant appeals according to law, and attaches a civil suit. The appellant was previously injured by Chen Zhonghua and others without cause, and filed a lawsuit. The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court has issued Criminal Judgment No. 249 of the 29th year of the Republic of China, which states, "Chen Zhonghua and Hu Kegen are each fined ten yuan for jointly causing bodily harm. Xiao Rong is not guilty," etc. The appellant finds this judgment difficult to accept. According to the regulations of the refugee shelter, all refugees must have their belongings checked by the doorman before taking them out. Therefore, the appellant took cold rice out every day to burn, and was checked by the doorman before going out. This has been going on for a year and a half, and all the staff know this. It is by no means an act of theft. Moreover, on that day, the appellant was carrying a rice pot and was still inside the refugee shelter, not taking the pot out. The appellees saw this and immediately took the appellant's rice pot away, which was unreasonable. Now the appellees say that "the appellant secretly took cold rice out of the door," which is not true. This is the first point of disagreement. The appellees beat the appellant deliberately and maliciously, and there was no other reason. The original judgment "said that Chen Zhonghua and Hu Kegen were angry for a moment," etc., which is inconsistent with the facts. This is the second point of disagreement. When the appellees beat the appellant, in addition to beating him with a rattan stick, they also used large nails to stab him in ten places, causing his skin to break and bleed, which was inhumane. If the appellant had not shouted loudly for help at the time, he would have been beaten to death. The original trial judgment stated, "The reasoning is that the appellant had purple bruises and swelling on his left and right arms, back, and thighs, and there were stab wounds on his legs." Why does the judgment say that "the facts are that he was angry for a moment and beat Jiang Shihai with a chicken feather duster handle and his hands, causing minor injuries"? This is clearly contradictory and unfair. This is the third point of disagreement. Xiao Rong saw Hu Donggen take the appellant to an empty room, and shouted loudly before the beating. He shouted before the beating. Now the judgment says that the defendant Xiao Rong only arrived at the scene after the fact and declared him not guilty. This is inconsistent with the facts. This is the fourth point of disagreement. In summary, the appellees committed the crime of intentionally causing serious injury. The original judgment only sentenced the appellees to a fine of ten yuan, which is too light and not enough to punish the wicked and protect the good. Therefore, the appellant appeals and respectfully requests your court to overturn the first instance judgment and sentence the appellees Chen Zhonghua, Hu Donggen, and Xiao Rong to severe punishment. In addition to the civil suit, the appellant requests that the court order them to pay for medical expenses and compensation totaling 200 yuan in national currency, and allow him to be re-admitted to the shelter in order to save his life. This would be a great kindness. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Higher Court Second Branch through the Shanghai First Special District Local Court for your consideration. June 17, 29th year of the Republic of China. Petitioner: Jiang Shihai.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: According to our client, Zhang Hengsen, manager of Renchang Cotton Cloth, the Shen Bao published a news item on the 5th of this month entitled "Counterfeit Trademark", which contained the phrase "Entrusted to Chen Guoan (i.e., Zheng Guoan), owner of Chang Cotton Cloth Store, No. 12 Jixiang Lane, Henan Road" and was extremely shocked. Zheng Guoan is only a clerk in our store and is neither the owner nor the manager. Therefore, Zheng Jun is responsible for all legal actions outside of his store duties, and our store is not involved. Moreover, according to Zheng Jun, he has not committed any illegal acts of counterfeiting trademarks. This supplementary accusation was made by Shan Xu Nanhua due to a personal grudge. Although the First Instance Court has sentenced him to a fine, he will file an appeal to seek redress. Therefore, we are entrusted to send a letter to correct the mistake and avoid misunderstandings. We hereby send this letter as above, hoping that you will grant the correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Pan Renxi, July 6th.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Military Township Examination <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>I have observed the dates of the civil and military township examinations. For the civil examination, on the day of entering the examination hall, the chief examiner, supervisor, and education officials all arrange their full staffs, and the examination hall is desolate. As for the military township examination, the yamen officials set up an exercise hall, the military students decorate their clothes and horses, and the spectators next to the horse troughs are like weaving. The clerks enter and leave the city day and night. From horse archery to skill and courage, it takes twenty days. Before the examination, the military students practice their skills themselves, and the period of the horse-worship ceremony is several months. Those who are not insiders must stop and watch when they encounter it. The splendor and brilliance are almost dazzling. Compared with the civil field, the difference is more than a courtyard. At first, this more than a month came to the whole country like crazy, but it was only for dozens of military candidates. Therefore, we know that the court's talent selection ceremony is so important. When we look at it on weekdays, those so-called military candidates, after several metropolitan examinations, are only employed for service and receive one month's salary. This can last for ten or twenty years, or even their whole lives. In the military field examination, archery and horsemanship are the most important, followed by skill and courage. The other four or five military classics are like civil students copying imperial edicts in a small test. If they enter the camp later, archery and horsemanship are only the skills required when the superiors come to inspect. What is valued in killing the enemy is not here. Therefore, regular military officers are not as proficient as those in the military.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. In the unofficial US-British exchange market, the selling pressure was difficult to dissipate. Many households were nervous and unable to persist. Although today's US-British exchange rate suddenly fell by a huge 13.5 cents, the opening US dollar was unusually tight. However, by noon closing, it had returned to the previous day's closing price. Moreover, due to rumors that British commercial banks in this city requested the government to stabilize the US dollar exchange rate to prevent it from falling freely, most operators were bullish on the pound. Chinese banks and speculators rushed to sell US dollars, which was very enthusiastic. However, the leading trend was still soft and hard, and current prices were already at the four-office mark, closing at four office zero three one two five. The future is infinitely changeable due to environmental changes, and the tightness and looseness are still dominated by the European war. The futures market is exactly the same as the spot market.</p>

HSBC's listed price announcement remained unchanged. The silver balance tax announcement reduced by 0.025%. After this, US banks also sold out, selling seven months of US exchange to foreign banks at six yuan two one eight seven five. The existing leading deal had been done at four offices, which was HSBC's intake. Until after half past ten, it was rumored that the British bank requested the government to balance the US exchange rate, which made the public bullish on the pound. At that time, Chinese banks and Chinese speculators vigorously threw seven months of US exchange, and the transaction price was six yuan three one two five. The loosest existing US exchange reached six yuan three four three seven five. The British hard to four offices outside, and the noon closing reported four offices zero three one two five.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: British and American gold pounds fell by one yuan each along with the price of gold. British gold notes also fell by 30 cents due to the black market British exchange rate breaking through the four pence mark. US gold notes initially rose to 16 yuan 15 cents in the morning due to the sudden surge in the pound price. However, due to ample supply from all parties, the market price gradually fell.

<h3 id="e94">Extremely Short-Lived Buying Sentiment: Gold Price Unable to Rise, Ultimately Drops Another Fifty Dollars <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market situation was erratic and volatile, with the overall sentiment remaining bleak. Operators showed weak buying appetite, with temporary purchases dominating. Furthermore, due to the tightening and infrequent loosening of the foreign exchange market, public confidence waned. The opening price in the morning was 5,150 yuan, and after manipulations by banks and securities firms, it briefly reached a high of 5,170 yuan. Unfortunately, the good times didn't last, and soon gold shops and retail investors took the opportunity to sell, pushing the price down to 5,075 yuan. Subsequently, thanks to renewed buying by money changers, the price recovered to above 5,100 yuan. Unexpectedly, as news of foreign exchange loosening spread and the outlook for exchange rates lengthened, many people inclined to sell, causing the price to plummet again to 5,040 yuan. The closing price was only 5,045 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, due to Saturday's market closure, only 2,000 taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry gold prices initially rose but then quickly returned to their previous levels. Customs gold prices remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Declines for Four Consecutive Days</p>
<p>Since the morning, initially the exchange rate was reported to be lengthening per tael (ten taels), with the US dollar reported to be tightening. However, operators were eager to sell at high prices. Although a certain securities firm took the lead in buying, the price only rose by 55 yuan. The securities firm, together with gold shops, purchased a total of 50 taels at 5,150 yuan. Subsequently, the price continued to rise by 10 yuan, with money changers purchasing 10 taels from banks at 5,160 yuan. Soon after, due to aggressive selling by gold shops and a weakening buying appetite, the price quickly fell by a small 35 yuan, with banks selling 20 taels to gold shops at 5,125 yuan. Afterwards, although the foreign exchange market remained tight, securities firms and banks absorbed at lower prices. Furthermore, as sellers became scarce, the price rose again by 45 yuan, with banks transacting 50 taels with each other at 5,170 yuan. However, due to low public expectations, gold shops again sold aggressively at high prices, and a certain bank and retail investors turned from bullish to bearish. The price soon fell again by 95 yuan, with gold shops trading 30 taels among themselves at 5,075 yuan. Later, a certain money changer aggressively purchased several hundred taels. Although the foreign exchange market was reported to be loosening at that time and retail investors were still selling, the price was eventually lifted by 35 yuan, with gold shops purchasing 10 taels from banks at 5,110 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued loosening of the foreign exchange market and a certain money changer halting purchases to observe, the price once again weakened and plummeted, with banks selling 30 taels to gold shops at 5,040 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops purchased 10 taels from banks at 5,045 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. As a result, the price fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous day. It has now declined for four consecutive days, a total drop of 385 yuan, with a fluctuation of 130 yuan in half a day. The selling price of current gold by local gold shops, based on spot, is several tens of yuan higher, while the purchase price is reduced by 30 yuan. The spot standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions being made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises and Then Falls Back</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops initially remained at 520 yuan at the Tahong Hang. At 9:40 AM, it increased by a large 10 yuan, and at 11:15 AM, it fell back by a small 10 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. In total, the Tahong Hang still kept the original price of 520 yuan. The price at the Xinhong Hang was the same as the previous price, while the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>

<p>—Up to July 6th—  St. Ke Qiong</p>
<p>(1) Gansu Provincial Bank Increases Capital</p>
<p>The capital increase of the Gansu Provincial Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, Chairman Shui Zi and General Manager Xu Yuankun officially took office on July 1st (see the Shen Bao of the 2nd). The Gansu Provincial Bank was established after the outbreak of the war. Its general situation is unfamiliar to the general financial community and those who study the financial situation. A more detailed introduction is provided here for reference by all parties.</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Gansu Provincial Bank was the Gansu Ping City Official Money Bureau, which was used to reorganize the money notes issued by the Gansu Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which had suspended operations. However, due to the lack of reserve funds, it could not be redeemed at that time, and the price fell to 40 strings per yuan. On April 17th of the 22nd year, the Money Bureau issued new notes, divided into four types: ten coins, twenty coins, fifty coins, and one hundred coins. On the one hand, it exchanged old notes for new notes at a rate of one string of new notes for every ten strings of old notes. On the other hand, it stipulated that four strings of new notes were equal to one yuan, and there was no limit to redemption. The bureau was directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance and, in addition to issuing notes, also engaged in remittance, deposit, and other businesses.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, in order to use the institutions of provincial and municipal banks to develop the economy of the northwestern provinces, the government formally reorganized it into the Gansu Provincial Bank on June 1st of the 28th year, adopting a board system. Liang Jingzhang, the director of the Department of Finance, was the chairman, Shui Zi and Xu Yuanfang were the standing directors, and Jia Jiying, Gu Zude, Zhang Wei, and Zheng Enqing were the directors. Li Shijun, Pei Jianzhun, and Shi Kuiling were the supervisors. During the era of the Ping City Official Money Bureau, due to organizational, financial, and other factual reasons, the matters that should be handled could not be handled. Since the reorganization, under the government's financial policy, it has shouldered four important missions: developing local production, promoting inter-provincial trade, expanding domestic finance, and encouraging rural production. Therefore, in August, a trust department was added, with Xu Yuanfang as the director and Ma Gongying and Wu Haoran as the deputy directors. Starting from September 1st, it handled national remittances. In order to assist the province's industry, it specially borrowed 800,000 yuan from the Industrial Cooperative Association to handle various industrial cooperation projects.</p>
<p>The bank currently has branches in Lanzhou, Suzhou, Lintao, Tianshui, Pingliang, etc., and offices in Liangzhou, Ganzhou, Linxia, Jingning, Huixian, Dingxi, Qin'an, Chengxian, Anxi, Yongdeng, Longxi, Weiyuan, Bikou, Zhangjiachuan, and Xifengzhen. Because it was reorganized from the Money Bureau, the issuance business continued to be carried out. According to the report of the bank's issuance inspection meeting on July 29th of the 28th year, as of May of the 28th year, the total amount of issuance was 3,825,622.50 yuan, including 3,597,420 yuan of subsidiary currency notes and 228,202.50 yuan of copper currency notes (912,810 strings).</p>
<p>Gansu Province has always had only one branch of the Central Bank and two offices and agricultural loan offices of the China Farmers Bank. In the 27th year, the Central Bank added an office, and in the 28th year, the Bank of Communications established a branch in Lanzhou and an office in Tianshui. Therefore, there are very few financial institutions. After the establishment of the Provincial Bank, although it can universally establish new-style bank branches and offices to develop the financial economy of Gansu Province, its financial strength is insufficient and cannot bear its important mission. Increasing capital is really urgent.</p>
<p>(2) The Mission of Mr. Song Ziwen's Trip to the United States</p>
<p>Since Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China and former Minister of Finance of the National Government, went to the United States, it has attracted much attention from Chinese and foreigners. According to reports from all sides, the figures Mr. Song met with included President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Welles, and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian in the political field, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Reconstruction Finance Corporation Chairman Jones, and Export-Import Bank President Pierson in the financial field. According to people involved, some say it was a social visit, and others say it was to renew friendships, as if Mr. Song's trip was solely for entertaining.</p>
<p>However, entertainment is a technique before carrying out a mission. After the entertainment, it is necessary to move into a normal path. So what is Mr. Song's mission? It can be seen from the classification of the people he met that there are two types: one is a financial mission, and the other is a political mission. The latter should not be discussed here. Regarding the former, personal observations are as follows:</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the US government's financial assistance to China first included a US$25 million credit loan in December 1938, and then a US$20 million credit loan on March 7, 1940. According to regulations, the US Export-Import Bank could no longer continue to lend after the first loan. However, with the efforts of the Chinese financial delegation, the good credit of the Chinese government in repaying debts, and its strong ability to repay debts, the US government specially ignored the trouble and passed a new law—that is, the US Congress approved the allocation of US$100 million of additional capital of the Export-Import Bank—and amended the foreign loan law to make the second loan possible. The use and guarantee of these two loans were all handled through the China Universal Trading Corporation. On the one hand, credit loans were used to purchase hardware, gasoline, trucks, road construction machinery, mining and smelting machinery, medicines, and other raw materials necessary for construction. On the other hand, tung oil, tin ore, and other raw materials were exported to repay debts, which were needed by American industries. However, after the sudden change in the European situation, Japan was eyeing the Far East. It first proposed to French Indochina to ban the export of resources to China, and then proposed to the United Kingdom to ban exports from Burma. It also surrounded Hong Kong and cut off the passage to Chongqing. How can China and the United States smoothly carry out "each gets what it needs" transactions without being obstructed by Japan? This is the first point of Mr. Song's financial mission. Secondly, the current anti-Japanese construction economic policy of Free China lies in being able to be self-sufficient. According to Economic Minister Weng Wenhao, "As the Japanese are approaching the supply lines of Chongqing, the National Government is making every effort to achieve self-sufficiency. Since the relocation of the capital, the government has issued many laws and regulations to improve and support the production of the rich inland provinces" (see the UPI report of the 4th). However, there is no doubt that it has not yet been fully able to achieve this goal. Then, the various tools needed to improve and support it are of course urgent and massive. Therefore, before the Japanese approach the supply lines of Chongqing, (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Food: Rice Price Evaluation Day 1, Imported Rice High Quality and Sufficient, Limited Transactions <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice market could hardly exceed the previous day's price due to the evaluation. There were no major ups or downs, and it can be said to be stable. In the early market, whether it was the local Zhejiang-Shaoxing merchants or local shops, they all eagerly purchased due to today being a regular Sunday holiday. Therefore, sellers continued to try to maintain prices, but buying was not loose, and transactions were all done at the same prices as the previous day. By the afternoon market, the inland sales volume turned sluggish. Lower-grade goods, such as Tokyo pointed red rice and broken pointed rice, which relied on the routes of those merchants, were seen to soften. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 aged Saigon remained at 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 64.5 yuan, 64 yuan, No. 1 Luo Siam at 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 64.2-3 yuan, 64 yuan, Fire Twisted at 65.5 yuan, 65 yuan, Hong Kong Pointed at 64.5 yuan, 64 yuan, 63.3 yuan, 63 yuan, while Tokyo Pointed was only 62 yuan, second grade 60 yuan, Haiphong Red Rice 61.5 yuan, 61 yuan, Mixed Broken 53 yuan, second grade to 50 yuan, Rice Tea 57 yuan, 56 yuan, second grade 54 yuan, a depreciation of 5-6 jiao. Only high-grade goods were firm and sufficient with limited transactions. For returned goods, 26 packs of No. 2 Siam rice opened at 72 yuan, jumping up by 1 yuan, and then increased by another 5 jiao to 72.5 yuan. 18 packs opened at 75 yuan, but the sellers shouted 1 yuan higher, without reaching an agreement. A total of 150 tons were traded.</p>
<p>The source of japonica and glutinous rice was still only nearly 1,000 bags of japonica rice arriving at the port. In terms of sales, it was rumored that the off-market price of japonica rice was still normal, so the selling price did not change and remained similar to the previous market. However, glutinous rice was still fragrant due to the lack of goods and continued to increase by half a yuan. Jin Piao Special Yuan 66 yuan, Chang Dan Bai Yuan 64.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Wheat Flour: Raw Material Scarcity <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>—Must Rely on Imported Wheat—</p>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday's flour supply, in addition to Fufeng Factory maintaining sales within the street, Fuxin Factory continued to suspend sales. However, 20,000 to 30,000 bags of inland miscellaneous brands of flour were newly transported to Shanghai. The green phoenix and other brands produced by the Shanghai-Japan factory were available for forward delivery. Those who needed it had to transfer to them. It was heard that yesterday's price of Double Lions Jinshan was 16.23 yuan, the spot price of Green Phoenix was 16.35 yuan, and the forward price for July-August delivery was 16.43-5 jiao yuan, with 4,000 to 5,000 bags being traded. Fufeng Factory also released about 5,000 bags of old car spleen, maintaining the original price of 15.2 jiao. It was also heard that merchants from other provinces purchased 2,000 to 3,000 bags of returned goods of No. 3 and No. 4 flour, and the selling price was equal to the factory price.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat was endless, with a total of 9 cars arriving, totaling more than 10,000 bags, but they were all monopolized by Japanese factories. The transportation permits for Chinese factories have not yet been officially issued. Therefore, Fuxin Factory recently ordered a ship of Australian wheat. It was heard yesterday that Fufeng Factory also ordered a ship of Australian wheat, reportedly more than 3,000 tons, with the price still around 30 yuan. Later batches are still under negotiation. During this period of new wheat flooding the market, they are urgently seeking foreign wheat. This is also being dominated by the environment.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Securities: Domestic Debt Rebounds Slightly <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Securities: The black market saw a slight recovery yesterday, with various bonds showing relative weakness. Ding bonds fell more. The afternoon was slightly stronger than the morning, probably because some of the floating surplus came out, and there were few new buyers. Bullish news has not yet been confirmed, and due to the relationship on Saturday, those doing me are at a disadvantage, so they are temporarily in a state of stagnation. There are many changes in the future, which cannot be reversed. Yesterday morning, Jiufeng Lianhe made up for the short positions, and Lianyi and No. 35 were slightly bought. Lemao, Tongshun, Renchang, Defu, etc. were all sold, and the market was slightly more bearish. The morning closing was slightly down by 3-4 jiao. In the afternoon, Renchang bought back Class A, Shuntai Runli bought Class C, and retail investors also had needs. Hongkang, Hongda, and Yitai were all sold, but the demand was still greater than the supply. Various bonds recovered by 2-3 jiao. As a result, it turned down by 5 fen 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 10 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Friday) Electricity, today's stock market listings of various Far Eastern British companies were generally stable. Only the British registered shares of HSBC Bank continued to rise by £2 to £65. Hong Kong registered shares remained unchanged, and there were no other ups and downs.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Friday) Electricity, today's Chinese foreign debt market listings were still stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Yarn and Cotton: After Major Players Absorb, Yarn Market Rises <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yarn Market: The market is good, and the situation has improved. This is because the actual transactions have progressed, and Hong Kong is purchasing very heavily. It is said that goods can be loaded at Guangzhou Bay. Therefore, the purchasing power of the Hong Kong gangs has increased. At the same time, the demand from the Ningbo gangs is also active. Therefore, people's confidence is boosted. A certain company in the market has taken in 400 to 500 bales of single yarn from the Shuangma factory, and the table is showing signs of tightness.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn was still flat, because there were no major changes in the overseas cotton market, but the foreign exchange rate shrunk again. The market price of Shuangma was flat at 885 yuan. Then it was heard that the Guang gangs were eagerly searching for current yarn, and the market传传 Jiangxi gangs also had transactions. People's confidence suddenly tightened, and the market gradually rose. After the chips of retail investors in the market were taken in by major players alone, they became more dry, and the multilateral parties took the opportunity to absorb and rise. The closing price was 922 yuan, and the closing price was 922 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics were 3,110 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 37 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed separately on the right.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Cotton Market Remains As Quiet As Before, Chinese Factories Continue to Suspend Operations <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Current cotton transactions still lack development. Only Japanese factories have a slight need, and the silver payments are slightly delayed. All transactions are in Indian cotton prices, which are also ordinary. However, yarn sales have slightly improved, and the sentiment in the cotton market is slightly better. However, each store has abundant goods on hand, and the tight silver supply has a significant impact on the market.</p>
<p>A batch of American cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday, shipped by the American President Lines' Doctor Lvkes, with more than 900 pieces. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>Another message on foreign cotton market prices, yesterday the New York cotton market rose slightly in the early morning due to public purchases, and then fell because spot merchants sold out and multi-heads closed in the near future. As a result, the closing price in the near future fell by 23 pounds, and the far future only fell by 2-3 pounds. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, it quickly predicted that it would rise by 1 rupee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has always been very quiet recently. Except for a part of Japanese factories purchasing and releasing loans for spot goods for one or two days, each colleague is limited by limited silver and cannot sell in large quantities. Chinese factories have sufficient inventory to meet current needs, so there are no transactions reported for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Sugar Market: Coarse White Tightens <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to Dutch telegrams, the Dutch East Indies will collect a small export commodity defense fee from today, at 2% of the value. Sugar is also included, and the cost will inevitably increase. Therefore, the market is slightly tight. The association's fixed price, the current spot price of 24 coarse white is 68 yuan at the local warehouse, and the price at the foreign warehouse is 67.6-8 jiao in the morning and 7 jiao in the afternoon, both up 2 jiao. Transit goods 53.4-6 jiao, delivery on July 10th 53.8 jiao, both up 6 jiao, delivery on July 20th 54.6 jiao, Taikoo car white has not changed much, B mark 78 yuan to 78.1 jiao, DY mark 76.5 jiao, Dutch red rose by 4.5 jiao to 57.5 jiao, no transactions. The factory's snow white is 68.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. The original price of the factory's ice sugar has not moved. For national sugar, the Guang gang has opened 200 packs of Hainan red, 51 yuan to 50.07 jiao. The Jian gang has opened 50 packs of oil bag Diaoqing, 64.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e102">North-South Goods: Green Bamboo Shoots Expected to Rise <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of green bamboo shoots has fallen, the settlement period for customer goods has recently arrived. Customers are not satisfied, and inventory is not willing to be sold cheaply. Therefore, the market may tighten today, with larger ones increasing by 1-2 jiao per small basket, because the cost is difficult to loosen. The goods of Guancaiji's fatty and particularly high-quality goods are particularly strong and still cost 3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Piece Goods: Price Cut of Palekis Promotes Sales <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The market for Palekis has been flooded recently, and the mainstream market price has been falling. The goods from this factory and the Dong goods are visible in the market. In fact, sales have been affected because the price is more than double the previous year's price. In the past, ordinary ones were usually bought for about 1 yuan per foot, but now they are sold for 3.35 yuan. Sales of Chinese clothing materials have been reduced by more than half, and the route for Western suits requires high-quality, thick materials. In addition, the sales period has passed for the most part. Although there is an outlet in the autumn, the number is limited. Since the armistice between France, Germany, and Italy, sellers have mostly shifted their concepts and are willing to sell the Palekis category at a reduced price, unlike other woolen fabrics that are firm and hoarding for profit. Looking at the gray plain Palekis of each brand, on average, the selling price per yard has fallen by 7-8 jiao compared to last weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bars Fall Again and Again <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Ribbed steel bars have recently been sluggish in sales, and the market price has fallen several times. It first fell from 1,500 yuan, and then reduced to 1,300-400 yuan. Recently, it has fallen to 1,250 yuan (this is for 3-4 fen goods), and the asking price for 5 fen to 1 inch patterns is only 1,200 yuan per ton, a decrease of several tens of yuan compared to the previous price. The only sales route for this product in Mu埠 should be the construction gang, but recently, the construction gang has adopted very little. In addition, the overseas customer gang business is also stagnant and has no spirit. Therefore, the current transactions are extremely desolate. Also, 1,500 pieces of galvanized iron came from the United States yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Coal: Korean Coal Dust Appears on the Market <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hongji white coal dust, in addition to supplying coal ball raw materials, has no other use. In recent months, various industrial factories have also replaced furnaces and switched to white coal dust because the price of bituminous coal is expensive. Therefore, the route has become more smooth and the market has been firm. Someone saw that there was a profit to be made, and a so-called new Korean white coal dust was brought to the market for activity, cutting prices for cash, but because the quality is inferior, it cannot be sold.</p>

<p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness..." This is a section from the Declaration of Independence passed by the American National Congress on July 4, 1776, and it has been the cornerstone of the American spirit of democracy for 164 years. In this important period when the two major forces of democracy and autocracy are competing for growth in the world, this declaration of independence is naturally more meaningful.</p>
<p>US Secretary of the Army Stimson said, "Long-range bombers have extended the US defense line to the far reaches of the Atlantic, including Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and northeastern Canada. A strong enemy can bomb our eastern coast if they gain a base in any of these places. Our country's national defense problems have become even more serious. Today, our country still has time to reorganize, relying on the fact that Britain can still control the North Atlantic. In this situation, assisting British maritime power in the North Atlantic has a very important impact on our own interests." In this way, the US eastern defense line has extended to the North Atlantic, which reminds people of the British former Prime Minister Baldwin's saying that the British defense line is on the Rhine.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt was elected in November 1932 and was re-elected in 1936. The statutory term of office is four years, which will expire on January 20 next year. The Republican Party nominated electrical industry tycoon Wendell Willkie as its presidential candidate last month on the 28th. The Democratic Party will hold a national convention in Chicago on the 14th of this month to nominate the presidential candidate. Before the Republican Party held its national convention in Philadelphia, New York District Court Prosecutor Dewey, Senator Taft, and Vandenberg were the most vocal in competing for the presidential nomination. Why did a Dark Horse Willkie emerge? This change in the situation was completely influenced by the European war. Dewey is very young and seems to lack the experience to deal with the crisis. Moreover, he has repeatedly published extremely isolationist political views during the competition for the primaries. Later, the European situation changed drastically, and this idea of "sweeping the snow in front of your own door and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs" became untimely. Taft and Vandenberg also advocated isolationism in their campaign speeches, so they were all defeated. Willkie debuted late and has not made any self-imposed remarks. He was able to follow the trend of public opinion and express his support for Britain. His cadres and national public opinion mostly supported him in breaking the precedent and competing for the third presidential term, but he himself remained silent. According to American political commentator Sullivan, American public opinion changes every day. The degree of American aid is directly proportional to how dangerous Britain is. From now until the November election, if the European war has stopped, then American public opinion will return to domestic affairs, and Roosevelt's position will inevitably be extremely unfavorable. Because everyone understands that Roosevelt's chances of becoming president for the third term depend on the American public's attention to the war. If domestic issues are the campaign theme, Roosevelt's chances of being elected will decrease. In short, the future of the American political situation still needs to depend on the development of the European war.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Lineage of Churchill <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, the wartime prime minister of Britain, hails from a distinguished family with a history of holding prominent positions. His achievements are remarkable and unique, setting him apart from other major British politicians. He enjoys widespread popular support and universal admiration. His appointment to handle difficult situations stems entirely from the people's endorsement, distinct from those who leverage political parties for personal gain. This truly embodies the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Churchill? This question can be answered by his biographers. Biographers must examine a person's life and achievements, much like an artist who captures a person's likeness by meticulously observing their facial features. Though different paths, they arrive at the same destination. Currently, our knowledge is limited, at best, resembling the perspective of a photographer.</p>
<p>Everything that we can know about Churchill seems to be known thoroughly. The ups and downs of his life, his robust physique, his serene smile, his sharp replies, and his public speeches delivered in harmonious tones are all vividly imprinted in people's minds.</p>
<p>How then do we understand him as a person? How did Churchill rise from a private in the army to wartime prime minister? Does he possess a unique quality that allows him to integrate all aspects of himself into one? We cannot help but look to his origins.</p>
<p>If we examine his family history and compare it with his past achievements, we will find that Churchill's characteristics are quite different from what one would expect of the grandson of the Duke of Marlborough. Churchill's style does not resemble that of a duke's descendant. In his political career, he embraced liberalism with sincerity and courage, disliked the aristocracy, and sought to weaken aristocratic power through heavy taxes and limiting the number of seats in the House of Lords. None of his thoughts or actions indicate his noble origins. Could it be that his maternal ancestry, being American, accounts for his unique sense of justice?</p>
<p>His father, Randolph Churchill, intended to marry Miss Jerome of New York. The Jerome sisters were originally a pair of beauties, but he only loved the "dark beauty". The mother of the two daughters was living in Paris at the time. The Duke was somewhat surprised upon hearing the news, and even Mrs. Jerome found it uninteresting. In 1873, crossing the Atlantic for a marriage was unprecedented. The young couple could only wait for their parents' love and approval. Before the end of the year, the lovers finally became a couple, and Londoners knew that the Duchess of Randolph was a lively dark beauty.</p>
<p>The wedding feast was grand, and distinguished guests gathered, starting with Prince Edward, all coming to offer congratulations. Disraeli, the old statesman, sat before his table, drinking brandy and water, turned his head, and facing the host, mumbled in a peculiar tone, "My dear Randolph, I have sipped champagne, emptied the wine, and drained the Badminton cup, and I don't want to drink any more." Such was his wit. The newlyweds found themselves in society, appreciating their own unique qualities. The groom began his career as a Conservative Party member. However, shortly after the marriage, they inevitably faced some financial challenges. Meanwhile, a child was born in the upstairs nursery, and they named him Winston Leonard Spencer. The first and last names were derived from Churchill's family, and the middle name was taken from his maternal grandfather, Leonard Jerome of New York City.</p>
<p>Churchill's life initially showed no traces of his transatlantic heritage. With his prestigious family background and handsome youth, it was natural for him to attend Harrow School and the Royal Military Academy. By 1896, the British army was inactive. Churchill retired and sought opportunities abroad, finally finding them across the Atlantic. At the time, the Spanish army was struggling with Cuban guerrilla tactics and was overwhelmed. Churchill joined the Cuban army as a cavalryman. This was the first time his hidden New York heritage was revealed externally.</p>
<p>Later, he served in the British regular army, fighting on the Northwest Frontier of India. Soon after, he travelled to the Sudan in Africa. At that time, Lord Kitchener was using troops on the upper reaches of the Nile, avenging the murdered Gordon, and severely punishing the local rabble outside Khartoum.</p>
<p>Before long, British troops were deployed to South Africa; Churchill departed as a war correspondent and was captured by Dutch immigrants. He relied on his intelligence and bravery to escape safely after a month.</p>
<p>After the end of the Boer War, Churchill left the military and engaged in social work. In reality, this "Cuban cavalryman" was already a statesman. The situation on the other side of the Atlantic was similar. Colonel Roosevelt was elected Vice President the same year Churchill entered Parliament. Not only did Churchill and Roosevelt's entry into politics coincide, but their style of resisting tyranny was also similar. Not long after the United States launched a severe attack on the "rich and unkind", Churchill also used his rising power to strike a blow against large landowners and hereditary aristocratic members of parliament.</p>
<p>Churchill was then a member of the left-wing Liberal Party, relying on Lloyd George as his right-hand man when he was in power. He used his eloquent and powerful speeches to attack the opposition with all his might, often saying, "The Liberal Party is the hope of millions of wandering and homeless people."</p>
<p>The year was 1910, and the world situation was becoming increasingly grim. At that time, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany was meticulously planning to destroy Britain. The Germans were building up their military and building ships on a large scale. The British looked out over the North Sea, feeling confused and disoriented. Churchill was then serving as Home Secretary. One day, armed police officers in London's East End raided a foreign anarchist organization. The two sides exchanged gunfire, and Churchill himself went to the scene to investigate. The people of the country were a little surprised by what this "Cuban cavalryman" was doing. In 1911, Churchill was transferred to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty, where he devoted all his energy to planning national defense policies. Churchill, originally from the military, had now become a naval expert as a messenger. At that time, he had to expand the army due to the situation.</p>
<p>In August 1914, the European war broke out. One night, Churchill swayed in from the outside to No. 10 Downing Street to inform the cabinet ministers that the war orders had been notified to all ships. The British fleet repeatedly shone in the ocean. At this time, the "Cuban cavalryman" had overshadowed many politicians. All his previous overzealous actions were forgiven because of his great achievements. In the last phase of the war, Churchill served as Minister of Munitions, making many changes to everything he did.</p>
<p>Churchill, having experienced the hardships of the world, became more and more experienced. His political style changed from the past and became closely connected with the Conservative Party. In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out, and Churchill was heartbroken, expressing reservations about the actions of the Red Party. Later, as he became more and more conservative, Churchill became politically isolated. But a brave politician cannot be lonely and shrink back. Churchill then served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for five years.</p>
<p>At this time, Baldwin was popular, and the gold standard still existed, while Hitler had not yet emerged. Later, when the two elders, Baldwin and MacDonald, were in power, they retreated blindly, and Churchill's rough style had no place for heroism. He finally resigned, like the angry prophet Jeremiah, shouting loudly in the wilderness.</p>
<p>However, everything the Germans did was predicted by Churchill. When the fires of war rose, Churchill was entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people and made a comeback. Eight months later, he was promoted to Prime Minister and was about to lead the British Empire to a final victory against Hitler. (Translated from the New York Times)</p>

<h3 id="e110">A Grand Record of the Second New York World's Fair <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>The New York World's Fair caused a sensation last year. It was truly as President Dill of the San Francisco Golden Gate International Exposition said: the New York World's Fair is the greatest event ever seen before or since, a once-in-a-lifetime experience. This year's fair is its second session, lasting from May 11 to October 27, a total of one hundred and seventy days and nights.</p>
<p>The results of last year's fair were not entirely satisfactory. The fair authorities have made major reforms in this year's second session in order to attract more visitors and generate greater revenue. The reasons for last year's failure were first, that it was too serious, and second, that the fees were too high. This year, efforts have been made to avoid these two shortcomings. From the opening ceremony onwards, everything is simple and casual, and the formalities of "top hats and white hard collars" have been largely omitted, striving for "commoner" appeal. Therefore, the form of the opening day was nothing more than drama and entertainment. The biggest feature this year is the addition of countless amusement venues, called the Great White Way, symbolizing New York's most bustling street, with brilliant lights at night.</p>
<p>Ticket prices, which were as high as 75 cents last year, have been reduced to 50 cents this year. Parking fees have also been reduced to 25 cents, and food and other expenses have also been made more affordable, with canteens offering meals for 5 cents and 10 cents, allowing visitors to eat their fill at the lowest cost. Other expenses, such as travel and accommodation, have been made cheaper than in previous years to the extent possible. The fair authorities have also focused on publicity and prize giveaways, with a golden key contest offering visitors the chance to win a car for free, as an attraction.</p>
<p>This year's fair has "Peace and Freedom" as its slogan. Last fall, when the first World's Fair was in full swing, the situation in Europe suddenly changed, followed by the outbreak of war. The beautiful world was instantly transformed into a battlefield. Although the United States was not involved in the whirlpool, it was disheartened by the increasing recklessness of the aggressors and wanted to promote peace and freedom in this gathering of nations. Therefore, on the opening day, many places were dedicated to expressing this good intention.</p>
<p>The venue is in the Brooklyn district of New York, with very convenient transportation. It is only a fifteen-minute train ride from the most bustling Manhattan district. It covers an area of 1,216 acres and is divided into two major sections: exhibitions and amusements. The design and construction costs of the entire venue have reached US$155 million. After the closing, all but the main buildings will be demolished and converted into a large park, as a permanent recreation area for the citizens. The venue opens at 9:00 AM every day, and the main exhibition halls open at 10:00 AM. The exhibition section closes at 10:00 PM. The amusement venues close at 2:00 AM.</p>
<p>Grand Opening</p>
<p>This year's World's Fair opened at noon on May 11. The ceremony was simple and full of vitality. There are a total of twelve entrances to the venue, and the opening ceremony was held at the East Entrance. Many people eager to see the excitement were waiting there early in the morning. At noon, New York Mayor LaGuardia officially cut the ribbon to open the fair. He said at the time, "I now formally open the 1940 New York World's Fair." The original English words were only nine words in total. At that time, the American national anthem was played, airplanes soared above, troops paraded, flags fluttered, and in addition, there were thousands upon thousands of men and women, a spectacle never seen before.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, a dedication ceremony was held in "Peace Square", completely centered on the fair's slogan of "Peace and Freedom". At that time, New York Governor Lehman addressed an audience of 20,000, saying that the United States must strengthen its army, navy, and air force, so that "no country, or several countries, dare to invade us". President Roosevelt also sent a letter to the conference, saying, "This is a manifestation of international common sense, and the exposition should achieve great success." The mayor spoke, explaining that there were no German or Soviet exhibits in the second session, saying that the exposition "must not allow these two international rogues to participate in it."</p>
<p>The ceremony was presided over by the Chairman of the World's Fair Board, Gibson. During the ceremony, 6,000 American Boy Scouts formed a living American flag in front of the square. At the same time, there was a grand parade of more than 10,000 people, including Boy Scouts, the US Army, Navy, National Guard, and representatives from sixteen countries, and the public. Among the representatives of the sixteen countries, the Netherlands held the first honorary position, followed by Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>
<p>Five girls from the countries at war with Germany—Belgium, the Netherlands, England, France, and Norway—wore their national costumes and held their national flags, forming a separate group in the parade to show their respect. Leading the parade was a twenty-five-year-old American girl named Qiqiu, representing the spirit of "Peace and Freedom". She wore a white robe and blue skirt, with a graceful figure, and was guarded by twelve men (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e112">How to Practice Calligraphy During Summer Vacation (Part 1) <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Baiying</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was invited by an elementary school to give a lecture, and I talked about this topic. Now I am copying it down and publishing it in the newspaper for the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p>Dear children, don't you have holiday homework during the summer vacation? There are many self-study subjects, and calligraphy is one of them. Judging from the current situation, calligraphy is not as important as reading or general knowledge, but you can't go without practicing it for the entire summer vacation. As the saying goes, "A fist must not leave the hand, and a song must not leave the mouth." Anything that requires practice should be reviewed every day and cannot be stopped. Once you stop, you will become unfamiliar and regress. So I would like to add another sentence to this saying: "When practicing calligraphy, you must not leave the tip of the pen." Although school is on summer vacation, calligraphy must not be put on vacation as well. Not only must it not be put on vacation, but you must practice diligently every day without interruption. If you don't practice at all during the entire summer vacation, when school starts after the vacation, the writing you produce will be like the work of two different people.</p>
<p>Some of you may ask, "What tools should I use to practice calligraphy during the summer vacation?" My answer is that from the perspective of the new era, and based on the application in today's society, pencils and fountain pens are used more often than brushes. Therefore, you cannot only use brushes when practicing. The best way is to write large characters with a brush and small characters with a pencil or fountain pen, using both at the same time, without favoring one over the other, so that you don't lose out.</p>
<p>Some of you may also ask, "How should I allocate my practice time?" I can explain it in two ways: The best time to practice during the day is in the morning, because it is cooler in the morning, and it is not easy to get tired when writing. The ideal length of a single practice session is about twenty to forty minutes. If the time is too short, the muscles will not have become skilled, and if you stop suddenly, you will not get any real benefit, as if you had not practiced at all. If the time is too long, you will inevitably become mentally and physically exhausted, and there will be no progress, which is also not appropriate. Therefore, using time appropriately is also an important condition.</p>
<p>Some of you may also ask: "When we practice calligraphy at school, we have copybooks distributed by the teacher, and we can imitate the model characters written by the teacher. If we practice at home, what do we write from?" My answer is:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Originally, It Was the Same Thing <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Let Me First Introduce a Painting</p>
<p>"This picture is a bit strange," the children must say. "That's right, this picture is a bit strange, and what's even stranger is that it's also a very good composition!" When I say this, the children will feel bewildered.</p>
<p>This is a picture drawn by an Indian who had not yet discovered writing, and it is also the writing they used and the composition they made to record their deeds and express their ideas.</p>
<p>In fact, this picture composition is not difficult to read. The five canoes, with many people in them, indicate that they crossed the lake to attack the enemy. The man riding the horse is clearly their leader. This attack lasted for three days, because there are three suns under the three brackets representing the sky. The bear and the eagle indicate that the victory of this attack was due to their bravery in battle. The strange beast, said to be a leopard, is the leader's name. The snake below indicates that they all returned in triumph, with no one killed.</p>
<p>In this way, isn't this a very good narrative composition?</p>
<p>Take our Chinese characters, for example. They were originally pictures. The characters "日" (sun) and "月" (moon) that we write now were written as "　" and "　" in ancient times. Aren't these pictures of the sun and the moon? So drawing pictures, writing characters, and writing compositions were originally the same thing, and they were only separated later.</p>
<p>Let Me Give Another Example</p>
<p>Suppose you are walking on the road, and someone gives you a piece of paper with two place names written on it. It turns out they are asking you for directions. After a little thought, you tell them the route, telling them to first walk in that direction, cross several roads, then turn there, and pass by some places before reaching their destination, and that there are some special landmarks in that place.</p>
<p>But you have been babbling on for a long time, and he is still at a loss. It turns out that he is a Cantonese who has just arrived in Shanghai, and he cannot understand your authentic Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>You have no choice but to take out your notebook and pencil, tear off a piece of paper, and write down the route in detail and give it to him, telling him to follow it.</p>
<p>But again, unexpectedly, he still stares at you and shakes his head. It turns out that he is illiterate, and that piece of paper with the place names was written by someone else.</p>
<p>This makes you embarrassed. What will you do? I think you will probably tear off another piece of paper and draw a detailed map of the route, pointing it out to him. Only then does he nod to you, thank you profusely, and happily follow your instructions.</p>
<p>If you do this, you will naturally use three tools - writing, composition, and drawing. These three tools have a common purpose, which is to express your own ideas and make others understand your ideas. A Simple Ruler</p>
<p>To know the length of something, we can use a ruler to measure it. To know the weight of something, we can use a scale to weigh it. It would be best if the characters we write, the compositions we make, and the pictures we draw also had something like a ruler and a scale that we could use to measure them. This is difficult. Writing characters, writing compositions, and drawing pictures have neither length to measure nor weight to weigh, so there is no way to measure them. However, the common purpose mentioned above can be used as a simple standard to roughly measure the quality of compositions, writing, and drawings. Until a better ruler and a better scale are found, we can reluctantly use it.</p>
<p>That is to say, whether your composition, writing, or drawing is good or bad depends on whether others understand the meaning you are expressing, and whether they understand it thoroughly.</p>
<p>For example, if you draw a picture of a tiger, and others say, "This looks like a dog," it is obvious that there is something wrong with your drawing. If you draw a landscape painting and plan to have people admire it, to evoke a sense of beauty, but people look at it and shake their heads, saying, "It's extremely ugly," then your painting has completely failed.</p>
<p>The same is true of compositions. For example, if you write a composition describing the lives of the poor people in Shanghai, wanting to evoke sympathy, but after reading your essay, people say, "Their lives are still quite comfortable," then it is obvious that your article is irrelevant. As for the characters you write, the most important thing is of course that they are written correctly, without errors, clearly, so that people will not look at them and not recognize your characters, leading to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>This is of course the most basic standard, and it is ridiculously simple. However, children may wish to try using it to measure their own compositions, writing, and drawings, and it may be of some help. This time, the Shen Bao is hosting a holiday homework competition, which specifically designates these three tasks. Children may wish to conduct an experiment and see if this ruler is of any use after all.</p>

<p>— Min</p>
<p>But you must know that even though it is acting, you must do it with your heart and effort. I remember one day, when I was practicing a performance in the "Little Colonel" scene, Director Butler suddenly raised his hand and said, "Shirley, this scene, your performance is not lively enough, please try again!" I was very unhappy when I heard Mr. Butler's words, and I almost cried. However, I finally followed his words and tried again with my heart. That day, Mr. Butler cheered and said, "That's good, dear, that's how you should do it!" And I was still happy.</p>
<p>This was the first time I felt that what Mr. Butler said was indeed correct, so after this scene was filmed, I walked up to him and said softly, "Mr. Butler, I think the performance just now was indeed terrible." Then I smiled at him slightly, meaning, "We understand each other, don't we?" Mr. Butler seemed to have picked me up and kissed me on the cheek, but I don't remember that.</p>
<p>However, I owe everything to my mother. If it weren't for her instructions, I wouldn't know how to perform. Whenever I was about to start working and star in a film, she would first tell me the story in detail. I still remember when they first called me to perform "War Baby," they gave me a script. My mother took me to a secluded corner of the studio, and she read the script once. It only took a few minutes, because this film was a short reel, and the whole thing only took more than ten minutes to show. Now, when you watch the films I star in, they often take more than an hour, which is very different. After she read the script, she told me the story and kept asking me, "Do you understand, dear? Do you understand completely?"</p>
<p>When we drove home from the studio, I asked my mother to tell the story again. Before she explained it, she told me who was acting with me in this film, who was playing the colonel, and who was playing the politician? I didn't understand what a colonel was or what a politician was, so I had to keep asking, and my mother had to explain it to me in detail.</p>
<p>When we got home, after dinner, my father gave me a bath, put on a bathrobe, and sat in the bathroom. My mother came to fix my curly hair, then went to the bedroom, lay down on the bed, covered myself with the quilt, and said to my mother, "Mom, I'm ready." My mother hurriedly closed the door, took the script book, sat on the edge of my bed, and read it to me sentence by sentence. Sometimes it was as long as a whole page, and sometimes it was more than a page. These scripts were contained in the story. I followed what my mother read, reading sentence by sentence, five or six times. Then she said to me, "Dear, you must be happy when you read these lines of dialogue." After my mother heard me read it fluently, she closed the book, and I had to remember these lines firmly, preparing to use them when I went to work at the studio the next morning.</p>

<h3 id="e115">From Yang Shengchun's Arrival in the South to Remembering Yang Xiaolou <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou, known as a master of the national opera, has been dead for almost three years now. At this time, Yang Shengchun, a Wusheng performer of the Yang school, has come to the South, and I cannot help but feel nostalgic and filled with emotion! Since Yang's death, those who flaunt the title of Yang school Wusheng include Sun Yukun, Liu Zongyang, Yang Shengchun, and Gao Shenglin. Liu is Yang's grandson. From childhood to adulthood, he was always by Yang's side. Among all, Zongyang knew Yang's voice, appearance, and smile the best, and he gained the most from it. If Zongyang could have been determined to improve and study diligently, then the person who could inherit Xiaolou's mantle would undoubtedly be Zongyang. Alas, this decadent playboy was accustomed to idleness and had no intention of pursuing further artistic refinement. This caused excellent material to be gradually abandoned and obscured, like a beautiful jade buried in barren soil. Is this not a great pity? Shenglin's aptitude is relatively inferior, and he seems to lack the talent to learn from Yang. Occasionally, there are successes, but they are not entirely satisfactory. Yang Shengchun is in his prime and has the greatest hope, but he needs a famous teacher to guide him in order to become a great talent. Sun Yukun has excellent material and a proper teacher. He is the only one who surpasses others in learning the Yang school with his spirit and skill. However, his will is not firm, and he is deeply addicted to bad habits that he does not abstain from. If he continues to drift along and does not seek to improve, then his future achievement will, at best, only amount to becoming a Sun Yukun of today.</p>
<p>Moreover, among the aforementioned people, except for Sun Yukun, most are younger successors who saw Yang in his old age (such as his eyes being afraid of the light and often closing, coughing on stage, and all movements on stage becoming slower). They have never witnessed Xiaolou's bravery and skill in his prime. Therefore, most of today's Yang learners commit the two faults of "decay" and "weakness," and they imitate all of Yang's shortcomings, fearing that they will not be similar enough. This is a major mistake for Yang learners, just like Shanghai amateur opera singers learning from Zhou Xinfang, who must first make their voices hoarse before flaunting themselves as the Qi school. Both are undesirable strategies to imitate.</p>
<p>Xiaolou's skills are admired throughout the country. When he was approaching sixty years old, people were worried that his art would not be passed on. At that time, the wise Mr. Ye Yuhu (Gongchuo) even made the contribution of "selecting talents and teaching them so that the unique art can be passed down," which shows how highly Xiaolou's art was valued in the world. I have a copy of Mr. Ye's original letter, and I am publishing it here as a decision, as it is also excellent historical material for the pear garden.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xiaolou, although I often saw you in Beiping, I never had the chance to talk in depth. I know nothing about opera, but I am very interested in it because I love literature and art. I believe that it is necessary to preserve the truth and characteristics of Chinese opera today in order to discuss improvement. If the truth is lost first, how can we know the gains and losses? In recent years, most opera performers have lost their original style in order to keep up with the times, and the older generation is gradually dying out, with few successors. This is especially a misfortune for this art. Your art surpasses your peers, and you have no rivals today. Even in Shanghai, which follows the trend, there are still people who truly appreciate you, which shows that fame comes after substance and that there is still justice in the world. However, what I want to tell you most urgently is that you should realize that you are a unique village in the Chinese opera world. For the sake of the Chinese opera world, you should be responsible for passing on your unique art to future generations. Now that you are over fifty years old and your physical strength is gradually declining, I wonder if there is anyone among your students who is capable of succeeding you? I believe that you should pay special attention to selecting those with good qualities and teachability, and do your best to mold them so that they can see the essence of the art, so that the unique art will not be lost and your great name will last forever, which is far better than leaving wealth to your descendants. What I saw in my illness is presented frankly and directly, I hope you will understand. Ye Gongchuo."</p>

<p>— New Square</p>
<p>British actress Vivien Leigh, who won the Academy Award for her role in "Gone with the Wind" last year, has gained worldwide fame. Recently, after completing her new film "Waterloo Bridge," Vivien Leigh and her new husband Laurence Olivier went to Broadway in New York to perform Shakespeare's famous play "Romeo and Juliet."</p>
<p>The news came that the performance industry was suspended from June 8th onwards. The two have been summoned by the British government and have decided to return home as soon as possible to join the wartime service department. Therefore, they have to temporarily bid farewell to all circles in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Vivien Leigh and others are returning to their country to serve completely voluntarily. It is said that Vivien had written to the national intelligence department beforehand, requesting to take on any work. Her patriotic spirit is truly admirable.</p>

<p>— Little Tian</p>
<p>A certain lawyer, after work, came to chat with me, from abroad to home, from official business to travel. Then we went to the park together. I saw two girls, Shan Shan, coming towards us, nodding their heads frequently. I looked at them carefully and they seemed familiar, but I couldn't remember their names. Then we talked to each other. One was Rong Feifei from Changzhou, and the other was Wang Weimei from Hong Kong. They had just returned from Hong Kong, due to the aftermath of the European storm, they had no choice but to return. According to them, the Hong Kong guests are more extravagant than those in Shanghai, because wealthy people are concentrated here, so few merchants have the habit of haggling over every penny. Feifei has joined Lido and is in great demand. On her first night, she sat at seven tables and received 350 gold coins. Big shots from Hong Kong also came to support her. The younger sister joined Dahua Nightclub, and I heard that her life is not bad. Because she is short, she is not suitable for dancing with tall people, so she is slightly inferior to Feifei.</p>
<p>The park tour was over, and we planned to find a place to dance. The tea dance was about to end, and the night dance was still early, so we went to a small dance hall on Fuxu Road. Although there was no music stage, there was air conditioning. There were more dancers than customers. Looking at them, there were few beauties. Just as we were about to leave, a woman lifted the curtain and entered. She looked a bit like Cheng Yanqiu more than ten years ago. My friend was a fan of Cheng opera, so we sat down again and urged me to try dancing. Although I didn't have the lightness of a flying swallow, my advances and retreats were still measured. I urged my friend to say that it was okay to bring out a city ticket, but my friend didn't listen. He went upstairs and called her to sit at the table, only three yuan per hour. It was a small expense. Looking at her carefully upstairs, she was indeed beautiful. I asked her name and she said it was Zhang Yongna, 17 years old, currently a freshman in a certain high school. My friend took out paper and asked her to write. Surprisingly, she could write in both Chinese and English. I then asked my friend, and my friend told the truth. She didn't believe it and said, "Those who play here are all common people. Lawyers must be literate. You try to write an English article, then I will believe it." My friend was a French student and was almost embarrassed. At that time, the woman was slightly arrogant, so my friend bought a city ticket and took her out. When we got into the car, I spied on the woman, and her arrogance had disappeared. When we arrived at the Metropolis, seeing the waiter's diligence and the dancers' frequent greetings, she also smiled humbly. This woman is indeed smart, and she will definitely be popular in the future. She is still a beautiful jade in a box.</p>

<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Golden Star Company, which is eagerly hoping to bring a different color to today's film industry, must start filming its maiden work on the 16th no matter what. The Golden Star authorities have internally decided on one of the three current popular stars to play the female lead, but a final decision has not yet been made, but it should be decided ten days ago.</p>
<p>Bai Yang sent a reply to Golden Star yesterday, saying that she will come to Shanghai, but she still has unfinished work in Chongqing, so she can only implement it after the autumn cools down. Gao Zhanfei also sent a letter, with opinions similar to Bai Yang, but said that it depends on the environment. His meaning seems to be that if the military celebration side fully agrees, then there will be no problem in returning to Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Bao</p>
<p>"Marriage" is a three-act satirical comedy by the great Russian writer Gogol, which took ten years to write. It was previously performed by the Shanghai Drama Society and the Shanghai Art Society one after another, and both were well received. The Gong Hua Drama Troupe, which is the drama group of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Staff Club, is no stranger to the amateur drama world. It has performed more than a dozen plays such as "The Death of a Famous Actor," "The True Story of Ah Q," and "Collecting Fishing Taxes." It is an excellent drama troupe with a pure purpose. Because it is buried in hard work and unwilling to publicize, it has little contact with the outside world.</p>
<p>Recently, Gong Hua performed two plays at the same time. One was "A Woman and a Dog," which was unanimously recognized as a difficult play, and the other was the world-famous play "Marriage." Both plays were directed by Zheng Tong, and the actors included Jiang Hong, Li Cong, Li Zhi, Ma Qu, Zhuang Hua, Xu Lin, Yi Wei, Zhao Qin, Zhong Qi, etc. Although most of them are newcomers to the drama stage, their acting skills are quite exquisite, and their performance attitude is especially serious and meticulous. Moreover, the director's technique is light and clear, and the handling of the comedy scenes is lively and beautiful. Therefore, the performance was very successful, and the audience praised it unanimously.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Opposing Information</p>
<p>Qin Mozhai walked to Wang Liland's corpse and took a careful look, shaking his head and saying to himself, "Alas! What a pity! Such a beauty, as if made of jade, would end up like this! Alas, the murderer is too cruel!" He turned his head again. "Hey, Mr. Hawthorne, Detective Ni, you have to work hard. This person must not be allowed to escape."</p>
<p>I thought to myself that although Qin Mozhai still maintained his talkative temper, he also showed that this dead dance queen did have some fascinating magic in her lifetime.</p>
<p>Hawthorne sarcastically said coldly, "You are this Miss Wang's confidant, it's just a little late!"</p>
<p>The police officer thought for a while, and then defended himself, "No, I am doing it for you two. This is a famous socialite who has been murdered. The newspaper will definitely have a lengthy report. Since you two are involved in this case, if you can't catch the murderer, it will not only be disappointing, but also a 'burden of fame'!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne bowed slightly. "Thank you for your advice and encouragement." He lit a cigarette and sat down slowly.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also felt Hawthorne's impatience, so he said with a serious face, "Chief Qin, if you want to express your opinions, you have to find a suitable time. Don't delay official business."</p>
<p>Qin Mozhai closed his lips tightly, shrank his neck, and then raised his hand to beckon to the four porters standing at the door.</p>
<p>After the four sturdy men came in, they first placed the stretcher on the carpet, and two of them began to move Wang Liland's body. The body was already a little stiff, and it was not very straight when it was placed on the stretcher, especially her head was hanging upside down. Hawthorne stood up again and gave the dead woman one last look. I had a strange feeling, how could there be no jewelry on such a wasteful and decadent woman. This feeling was expressed by Ni Jinshou.
