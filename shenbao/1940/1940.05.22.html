<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰此一仗</h3>
<p>據法國方面昨日所傳播的軍事消息，業已承認放棄拉翁城；即德軍攻破馬奇諾防綫之後，逐步向西南推進，其突入法國疆界的部分，愈趨愈深。其他軍息，則稱戰綫蔓延，戰塲遼闊，戰况渾沌，德軍已遭堅强抵抗，三日來鋒銳既挫，所進無多云。</p>
<p>歐戰範圍擴展到荷蘭比利時盧森堡三國，事在本月十日淸晨，距今不過十二三日；不但荷蘭不經一擊、比國瀕於全境淪陷，彼英法聯軍亦每戰輒敗；英法政府的諄諄誥誡其人民的，絕不諱言於形勢嚴重；而德軍的優良精銳，幾爲人人所嘆服。世界各力之同情於英法的，爲之震驚憂疑；如美國總統羅斯一福氏竭其全力促成擴軍預算，促進飛機製造能率，可見大局阽危；又如同情央法者甚至擬議及於倘若美國未能　早力援英法，以致英法敗績；英國朝廷竟遷主加拿大，則美國應付更窘云，可見所憂之深遠；又如美國孤立派大張其反對參戰的旗幟，可見問題的逼近；諸如此類，可以說明歐洲近日戰績所給人的印象，如伺深刻！</p>
<p>戰局大體究竟如何？德軍攻城陷地，確佔優勢，而德國萊茵陣綫報且謂「現在戰事自陣地戰進入運動戰之後，不出數日，即可決定勝負」，似乎大戰到了最後關頭了。如此嚴重的事實當前，不容據何成見，作何期待；所可根據客觀事實，追求其究竟的：第一，德國根本戰略是速戰速決；西綫相持八月有餘，這在德國爲不堪忍受，因此髯冒天下大不韙，侵犯丹麥挪威於先，侵犯荷比盧三國於後，以主於今日，併其主力，覷破馬奇諾陣綫的弱點，長驅直入；此其意我，乃爲最初八月，德國蘄求速戰速決，然欲速戰而不得；今則在彼戰略上，貫澈其初步宏願，而得速戰。第二，以此次德國淮攻法國而論，所用武力，可信其以陣勢地形爲標準，而運用其適應此標準的最大力量；在法國乃至英法比波聯軍方面，自始選定馬奇諾防綫爲其最可恃的決勝綫，及至德軍改道乘虛進攻，聯軍當然儘其地形與時間所容許，對抗之以最大力量；因此之故，這一决大規模會戰的結果，必在目前所謂「戰况混沌」之後，必分關係極重要的勝敗。第三，德報所謂「不出數日，即可決定勝敗」，其言有其一部分之可信；但所謂勝敗，將爲此一仗的勝敗，抑爲整個戰爭的勝敗？在今日小容武斷；申言之，假定敗屬德國，則德國在軍事經濟政治種種方面，是否容許繼續作戰，準備再度大戰，猶是問題；假定敗屬聯軍，則英法兩國至少在經濟政治種種方面當能繼續再戰，但軍事方面損敗的程度是否逼使英法　時間上不得不對德妥協，亦是問題；凡此問題惟待事實爲答案，而非混沛的今日所得逆覩。第四，假定德國勝此一仗，假定英法敗於此仗而以更大的決心與努力，儘速得應付再度大戰，則再戰勝敗未可知，然德國「速決」戰略的宏願，却因此而渺遠之甚。第五，現代戰爭，決勝於主力的最後相拚；目前雙方會戰中所運用的主力，在德國方面的百分比雖必較聯軍主力的百分比爲高，但雙方各非主力的全部；由此作平衡而正常的推測，此仗之後，聯軍所剩餘的主力，當較德軍所剩者爲厚；况英法更有海外屬國爲有力後盾，祗要時間所容許，則德軍雖勝，而倘若必須應付再度大戰時，德軍殆將較英法爲艱難。就戰論戰，大體殆若此。目前同情於英法者所懷抱的憂疑，吾人小能不疑其過度。所不可知的，德國對於這决歐戰，實屬處心積慮，爲時已久，周詳擘畫，無微不至；而英法方面，數年來因爲政治上機構的關係，人事的關係，在在見得比較德國爲鬆懈而落後；故德國在英法兩國國內所布置的所謂「第五縱隊」，將如何作爲，如何奏效，這是英法內在的顧慮。同時，德國以初期勝利的餘威，在國際亦極有運用的餘地；則聯軍倘若大敗於此一仗，則國際磨刀霍霍者，極有下井投石的可能，這是英法外在的危機。兩國交爭，最初繫於將帥，其决繫於隊伍，其次繫於整個軍備，其次繫於整個國族的力量；更决而到現在，則國際形勢的趨嚮，第三者的舉足重輕，在在影響交爭的兩國。總之，歐戰前途如何，論斷猶早，悲觀樂觀猶早，諸待拭目靜觀。</p>

<p>女靑乒乓總測騐　楊兵棣獲首席　第二張亦煊第三方養初　下星期二召集組織勁旅</p>
<p>女靑年會主辦之第三屆女子乒乓訓練班、昨下午四時在該會大禮堂舉行總測騐、到女賓甚衆、由陳霖笙賀旭初主持考核、訓練員僅數人因故缺席、本屆測騐方法、採升降競賽制、極爲嚴格、各人戰來、倍見緊張下而水凖之高、更出乎預料之佳、大受觀衆讚美、結果削手楊成棣小姐、壓倒諸將、榮獲首席、抽球之張亦煊方養初、奪得二三兩席、短擋傑出之張德馨小姐、因球運小佳、屈居第四、該賽共錄取最優秀十人、定下週二召集、加以組織、俾與外界比賽、多求經驗云、茲探錄十名名單、及指導陳霖笙對前四名成績優良者發表評語如下、</p>
<p>優勝名單</p>
<p>（一）楊成棣（二）張亦煊（三）方養初（四）張德馨（五）包雲弟（六）朱慧文（七）顧秀蓮（八）顧娟芯（九）周雅琴（十）　慶祝</p>
<p>球藝簡評</p>
<p>（楊成棣）負及於民立女中、善削球、自報名女靑訓練班後、練習殊勤、進步奇速、其削球益見穩健、兼亦能抽、臨陣鎭定、富長力、此次一鳴驚人、榮獲首席、絕非倖致、</p>
<p>（張亦煊）身材極長、兼精排球、故善奔跑、抽球甚佳、守球尚無硏究、一遇攻球之輩、即難顯所長、惜其愛好其他運動太多、平日練習乒乓、未見專心、吾則進展當不止此、</p>
<p>（方養初）體格頗胖、目光較差、賴其天賦之佳、奪得第三、可謂不易、其球藝則抽擋兼長、比賽時更能始終奮鬭、不露怠容、殊屬難能、</p>
<p>（張德馨）爲建樹女中之高材生、球藝則攻守皆能、短擋尤佳、身材靈活、打球姿態美觀、不可多得、而年齡尚幼、如肯深下功夫、實一全能人才、前途希望最濃、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯形勢一轉　英美匯市況步緊</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、於買風轉盛之下、反動趨軟、原因歐洲戰事、協約國形勢微告轉穩、匯兌飛長五分七五、人心不免略受影響、初開英平美稍帶硬、華商力扒、缺少供售、頓見步緊至先令四辦士一二五、美匯僅結五元六二五、忽外電傳央·法·意三國電話中斷、歐局嚴重、且沙遜力塞先令、日銀行與紗廠猛拋美匯、投機家一度復塞、頓見步硬至四辦士二一八七五及五元七五、奈匯豐力吸、日洋行亦扒、近午復緊、下干有利等外銀行吸胃仍殷、華商力進小懈、市勢步趨緊縮、直軟至收市先令四辦士〇六二五、美金五元半、計英緊一七一八七五、美緊二五、聞平準基金委員會匯豐等行扒結先令達二十一萬鎊之鉅、亦匯市轉緊之一原因、</p>
<p>英美滙兌猛長</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近跌八七五、遠降六二五、紐約銀偵仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬長一五六二五、對法未更、美對英鬆五分七五、對滬大二角、對法升三分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士二三四三七五、美匯五元七八一二五、較之上日晚收、英平美硬〇三一二五、乃匯兌回漲之故、開後潛勢不穩、華商投機家首來扒結、且缺乏賣戶、價遂軟化、最初外行出華投機商五月份美滙爲五元六八七五、與五九三七五、後華商投機家吸入美行同月美匯已告五元五六二五、時現貨英金最軟達四辦士一二五、美匯五元六二五、匯豐掛牌揭　勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉减低百分之四·五、嗣因日行來市猛塞、並傳英·法·意等國電綫中斷、人心對歐洲戰事咸有變化之慮、故華商投機家反進爲出、日銀行與日紗廠四起傾售、但其時平準基金委會曾購納六七萬鎊先令、是以買賣尚能相抵、鬆勢較前和緩、現美匯日行售予外行五元七一八七五至七五、五月份美匯華投機商吐予外行五元六八七五、及七一八七五、又沙遜出滙豐現先令則爲四辦士一五六二五、迨至午刻日商三井洋行等突來結進、無如賣戶已漸疏散、市象重又回聚、結果英金四辦士一二五、美滙五元六二五、五月份英金四辦士一〇九三七五、美匯五元五九三七五、六月份英金三辦士九五三一二五、美匯五元三四三七五、較晨間英緊一〇九三七五、美軟　五六二五、期貨俱縮、</p>
<p>滙豐港方均吸</p>
<p>午後緊勢愈銳、初有利扒入外行五月份美匯即告五元半、後外行一度對做六月份央金價三辦士九〇六二五、且悉平凖委員會又吸進十餘萬鎊先令、致市面愈形見緊、收盤前華商投機家納外行五月份美匯已達五元四六八七五、又六月份祇五元二五、收盤價英金四辦士〇六二五、美匯五元半、本月份英金四辦士〇三一二五、美匯五元四六八七五、下月份英金三辦士八七五、美匯五元二一八七五、比上日現貨英縮一七一八七五、美軟二五、五六月份英金俱緊一八七五、美匯亦各緊二五、</p>
<p>香港英平美鬆</p>
<p>香港二十一日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英匯現期貨均站原盤、美匯現貨鬆一八七五、爲二十元三七五、申匯現貨升九元、爲三百五十五元、日匯現貨放長一圓半、爲八十六圓半、十時三十分告平、申匯現貨續升二元、爲三百五十七元、十一時三十分告平、申匯現貨回降三元、爲三百五十四元、午收平定、美匯現貨續鬆〇〇六二五、爲二十元四三七五、申匯現貨重升四元、爲三百五十八元、下午二時三十分、開盤告平、各匯概無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津美滙五元</p>
<p>天津二十一日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤微軟、英滙現貨緊一二五、爲三便士六八七五、美滙現貨亦縮一二五、爲五元、申匯升半元、爲一百十一元半、「聯鈔」暗盤昂半元爲一百元、</p>
<h3>港幫再度吸收　金價反動回漲　收盤已達五千八百卅元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、迂迴向上、兩日之間漲跌足相抵銷、蓋人心俱爲歐洲戰事消息所左右、市價緊隨滙市變動而上落、晨初買氣濃厚、兼報外滙趨縮、市况尤昂、開盤價爲五千七百元、嗣首受銀號錢兌業出售、曾撳五十元、終因需要漸殷、證劵帮金號一致在購、復述五千七百二十元、惟不久忽傳英法意電話綫中斷、並聞外滙轉硬、賣風驟起、一度猛降至五千四百七十元、尚幸午刻散戶及金號搜進尚勁、得告五千六百五十元收盤後市爲狀更佳、因港帮吸收、暨空戶亟亟抵補、由開盤五千六百四十元、立升達七百四十元、雖證券帮　吐塞於後、結果金號搜入卒告五千八百三十元高價收市、較上日軋漲三百三十元、全天交易甚旺約四千兩之上、銀樓飾金掛高三十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲三百卅元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開滙市告緊、人心堅挺、首由金號吸收銀號二十兩、爲五千七百元、比上日做好二百元之多、嗣因錢兌業及銀號帮吐出、曾回挫五十元、銀號出散戶共五十兩、爲五千六百五十元、旋外滙仍告步緊、再加證券帮金號互相搜入、而某銀號吃胃亦佳、復上漲七十元、錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、爲五千七百五十元、但斯時市上突傳英法意電話綫中斷、外滙急告鬆動、人心頓轉、檯面上一片賣出、浮多先後　售、銀號一再拋空、雖某銀樓代客帮一路限價買進、奈頭寸仍感供過於求、不久傾瀉二百五十元、銀號出證劵帮三十兩、爲五千四百七十元、此後滙市忽又走緊、賣風逐漸疏散、而錢號轉賣爲買、金號復來拖入、得提起一百九十元、金號進銀號三十兩、爲五千六百六十元、繼而銀號進金號等三十兩、爲五千六百五十元作午收價、午後開市略撳十元、金號對做十兩、爲五千六百四十元、繼乃滙市報軟、買風陡濃、金號及某銀樓復代港帮扒進、而某銀號補空亦切、飛漲一百元、金號出錢兌業一百兩、爲五千七白四十元、其時買者轉少、證券帮及某金號吐出若干、回落九十元、錢兌業出證劵帮十兩、爲五千六百五十元、入後某銀號見低再進、且港審再度活動、加之外滙依然告緊、賣者極少、迨晚收時竟猛升一百八十元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲五千八百三十元、作晚收價、結果比上日回漲三百三十元、全天三百六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金改懸六百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十元、迨至九時半掛高二十元、逾十分鍊回落十元、十一時再回小十元、正午復又掛大十元、午後三時三十分又高十元、四時再高十元、結果軋大三十元、計大同行改懸六百元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣急遽上騰</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、以港帮力購黃金、故英美金鎊回漲甚勁、英金票需要陡增、市價回起甚鉅、美金票以黑市美匯驟緊、各方需要激增、晚市高至十八元一角半、香港票緊隨港滬匯兌而漲、此外如法耶·新加坡·安南·羅比·坎拿大·菲列濱票等均有需要、市價一致趨漲、惟日金票供塞未减、晚市退爲一元零八分、朝鮮票供求仍均勻、晚市仍爲九角二分、</p>
<h3>滙劃貼現平疲</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、續趨平疲、每千元之貼率、始終在一百十三元至一百十八元間、比上日的跌二元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛二角六分、再升二分云、</p>
<h3>證券　外股小額買賣　債市又見平疲</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况忽又疾趨而下、開盤後因浮多　先出脫、一時人心轉虛、價乃隨賣氣高壓逐步向下、可見銀根之緊、實爲多方重大之阻碍、惟目下因外滙步步見長、套利交易、旣發生搖動且亦未見超過普通押軟之利率、銀根方面當可因此稍鬆、故公債前途或可窺見曙光、昨日上午、因聯和忽又大批脫手、怡泰鼎康仁昌等亦隨勢斬多、鴻康樂茂雖有抵進已覺抵抗小住、丙種遂又退進五十元關、惟散戶仍係出多進少、午後聯和仁昌繼續拋賣、鴻大賣出爲多、四十一號入丙出甲、永康同康需要較多、故行市比較安定、結果一致回小四角至六角半、成交總數約計七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲六〇·三〇　六〇·〇〇六〇·〇〇跌〇·五〇</p>
<p>統乙　二·〇〇　五一·八五五一·九〇又〇·四〇</p>
<p>統丙五〇·一〇　四九·七〇　九·九〇又〇·四五</p>
<p>統丁四八·七〇　四八·五五　八·五五又〇·四五</p>
<p>統戊五〇·三〇　四九·九五五〇·一五又〇·六〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股一百股、價爲八元正、衆業股市開盤、公衆情緒、似見鬆弛、而無前數日之緊張、蓋昨日之煩重交割、業已安然渡通、此番交割帳項中、固有不少鉅數虧蝕額在內、於以見市塲經濟力量充裕、未可厚非、</p>
<p>昨日成交總額、較前日約减十萬股、但各經紀人忙碌猶昔、因交易大半限於小額定單、由於歐戰消息轉佳、開盤市况上趨、不幸此風不長、因賣戶稍盛、價格又降、參與交易各股、種類較前普及、英聯復爲之首、其次爲怡和股、收盤市况甚穩、橡皮股趨勢　軟、買方與趣極少，成交亦鮮、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日（週一）電今日中國外債不變、英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、銀行股續告疲落、計麥加利銀行股續跌五先令、爲八鎊十先令、滙豐銀行股各跌二鎊、英倫註冊股價爲七十八鎊、香港註冊股價爲八十鎊、其餘告平、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米升降靡常</h3>
<p>昨日上午米市、因上日匯水放長各貨　說跌二元有奇之影響、故昨晨買賣、專侯金匯消息、定共意向、致全市一無進出、迨得金市平穩之訊、方始活動，其內地鄕莊客戶首先乘廉搜進、　之補空吸收亦力、形勢乃覺栗落、做開小絞四十六元、較之前日午後牧價四十五元、已提一元、此後雙方時出時進、賣買頗旺、而市面　　驟降、倏忽不定、小絞最高時曾喊四十七元、小過此價未曾實現、卒以四十六元半收盤、與前日上午收價相仿、其他各貨亦然如是、計一號陳西貢仍爲五十元、二號四十七元半、四十七元、火絞四十八元、一號暹　四十八元半、四十八元、二號四十六元半、四十六元、東京　尖四十五元半、四十五元、</p>
<p>又訊洋米昨日忽升忽降、漲落靡常、然其結果終比前日盤漲一元左右、蓋被滙縮金漲所吸引買戶、實銷旣趁平問津、投機又復活躍、各米售價隨又逐步拉高、市塲中小絞米最爲熱　活潑、早晨四十五尤半開價、旋自四十五元七角大至四十六元半、上午收價四十六元三角、午後一度昇至四十六元八角、旋又降至四十六元一角、晚收四十六元半、比前晚漲一元許、其他各米亦復互有上落、二號西貢原包則目六十一元至六十一元三角半、開出數十噸、現米約六千多包、</p>
<p>國米、昨到較樣、祇共一二千包、傳聞塲外粳米暗盤、因兼洋米平穩、人心頗定、售盤未有榮辱、而市上糯米交易相隨無甚變化、均稱定局云、</p>
<p>本市洋米、絡續運甬、　屬振米、昨日華綸洋行瑞泰輪赴甬、裝去三千四百餘包、今日海福·阿維瑪理兩輪駛甬、亦有數千包運去、（祖）</p>
<h3>麵粉本銷微動　廠盤昨已一致</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨査二號粉廠盤經前日减低二角後、本街零批交易、較前略增、惟前日老車牌廠盤仍須十四元、因福新與　豐廠盤一度發生互異、故粉號零售老車牌十四元〇五分、輻新牌祗十三元九角、聞昨日起已一律改售十三元九角、各廠零批一律十三元八角、所以本街去化略見增加也、至於客銷方面、則仍沉靜、內地粉受環境與廠盤貶價影響、連日步鬆、昨聞無錫當地粉價報漲、內地粉趨勢漸告平穩、順風牌開過十三元三角半、回籠貨供求兩靜、暫鮮成交、市面大局、尚在醞釀中、又麵粉有五千包、運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥　近日小麥交易、久居停頓、因陳麥早巳落令、新麥尚未上市、大致十天以後、即可登塲矣、</p>
<p>又訊、昨聞洋麥新到一船、約計七千餘噸、此係滬粉廠之前批定麥、在上月間裝出者目下歐戰嚴重、恐今後來源發生問題、惟此項消息、廠方猶未證實</p>
<h3>紗花　外棉轉機　紗亦向榮　雙馬漲五十五元</h3>
<p>上日大跌之紗市、昨則稍形回好、良以現紗銷路尚稱不弱、同時海外棉市回好一步、致人心略爲安定耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因美印棉市一致回升、塲中買氣轉熾、二十支雙馬爲一千三百元、漲二三十元、少頃聞金價不振、又趨下降、旋聞廣帮實銷仍佳、又復徐徐前進、至一千三百四十元、卒以外滙平庸、又告回挫、査半日間成交統計一千五百十四包、行情二十支雙馬漲五十五元、今日有紗一百二十五件運寗波、又九百五十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　六六〇　同行　八一〇</p>
<p>雲南　四四　統計　一、五一四</p>
<h3>外市變化莫測　棉商觀望</h3>
<p>本棉成交稍有做開、市象已轉入安定之途矣、但同業買賣依然不及昔日之興盛、實以世界情形尚在變化莫測中、所以市面臘盪不定也、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>大中集　二六·〇〇　同行進六〇包</p>
<p>通州　一二三·〇〇　又　九〇包</p>
<p>白洛去　二四〇·〇〇又二四　·〇〇　二〇〇件</p>
<p>火草包　二〇五·〇〇　又　一三六包</p>
<p>通打包　二三七·〇〇　又　八二件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、細約棉市、晨初開盤即因投機者之購進、後因現貨商之購買及一部份之空頭抵補而再堅、結果收盤市價較之六日漲廿七八至三十餘磅音、印度速同預測漲九羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日殊爲靜寂、各方俱以局勢不穩定、匯兌上落過巨、故暫抱觀望、天津帮進胃亦殊呆滯也、茲將昨日棉市、以美匯五元半折合美棉期貨價格如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　四一七·七</p>
<p>又　又　下級　四一七·五〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　二五一·三〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三四二·二〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　　　四·八〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三四四·五〇</p>
<h3>疋頭　外滙轉縮　東布重振</h3>
<p>昨東疋市盤、先疲後漲、白貨龍頭細布現出晨開因實銷仍淡、自四十二元降至三十九元七角半、下午市塲雖停業、而各洋行及同業字號仍照常交易、北路秦皇島帮續來採辦中下檔細布七百餘件、本街同業人心被外滙轉縮及標金回升所引動、訂購下月份細布嗶嘰等五百餘件、一時形勢轉緊、龍頭細布現出升至四十二元七角半、下月份做開四十六元五角、四君子元嗶嘰現盤增至一元一角五分半、下月份一元二角七分、即疲滯已久之中檔各牌細布、每疋亦均提漲一元半至二元、</p>
<p>又疋頭今（二十二日）有三十件、運往寗波、又三百八十五件運香港、又七百七十件運海防、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃荳客銷活絡　油價回升二元半　荳餅亦砌二角外</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油豆餅市况因空氣和緩、環境鬆弛、人心稍見開展、故各種市價由疲轉定、油　則轉升二元半、豆餅亦砌二角外、黃豆市面、在疲軟之情形下，釐旋立定、交易因之活絡、　日商搾油廠辦去蚌埠豆五六車、　爲二十三元三角半、出口　汕頭興化泉州　採去安慶豆二千餘包、價自二十三元四角至二十二元七角、本街囤戶問津蕪湖豆四百包、價爲二十二元五角二十二元、桑　豆　餘包、價爲二十一元七角、及平湖花皮豆三四百包、價爲二十三元二十二元五角云、</p>
<p>又豆子今（二十二日）有一千四百二十包、及芝蔴五百包、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白回升</h3>
<p>昨粗白以外滙見縮、略見回好、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白本棧貨七十元至七十元半、外綫貨上午爲六十九元至六十九尤半、下午初亦同　、　升至七十元、轉口貨上午五十五元一角至五角、下午五十五元半至五十六元、均升一元、太古車白　甚上落、B嘜新貨八十二尤八角、老貨八十二元、HX嘜新貨八十一元八角、H嘜車赤六十元、小五角、荷赤六十三元半、小一元　本廠雪白七十一元、一號冰九十五元、晶明冰九十六元半、國糖刁靑因產　高、兼有禁止出口之說、故客方有欲扳售七十元者、但靑糖決不能反昂於白釐、正式號盤叫六十五元、未有成交、又睛囒糖昨到二千一　　、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤跌去拾元</h3>
<p>白煤行情、日昨自匯市　鬆、各種洋煤、暗盤均不支而跌、同業　拆、一概做小十元盤子、計開鴻基白煤每噸二百零六元、　峯白煤兩百十二以小、以上均同業棧房自車、本街發客、照盤酌加行　、</p>

<h3>巫覡</h3>
<p>巫覡之說，自昔有之，最古者巫咸因是以為姓。孔子曰：「不可以作巫醫。」孟子曰：「巫匠亦然。」是巫覡之事，聖賢亦存其說，故周禮特設一官以掌之，蓋其由來已久，從無有起而非之者矣。然而古之所謂巫者，不過主禱祀之事，如祝史之流，以其習於鬼神而使之　達誠意，非若今時之巫，以術行其奸也。古時人與神近，故春秋所載，每有神降於莘，鬼入於寢之說，　事鬼神之道，亦較後世為虔；雖左氏多誣，究亦非無因而造作也。然桑田之巫，以術殺身，左氏傳之，所以使後世不為若輩所惑，即有奇術異能，言必有中者，猶不能自保其身若此，他何論焉。蘇城山塘某姓翁有疾，笑罵無常，不省人事。內經曰：「痰人心包，其狀若痴，神昏譫語，不省人事。」此其中並無鬼神附　也。乃以習俗之見，以為遇崇，不延醫而延巫，巫者必不肯謂無崇，於是逞其私智，矜其怪誕，而以桐油之符食之，竟為術者所誤而致死，甚矣吳人之信鬼神而適足以殺其軀也！</p>

<h3>你往那裏去　（四）</h3>
<p>大凡沒有計劃的生活，總無成功的希望，這是確切不移的眞理。哈佛次學哲姆斯敎授嘗說，『執成年人而問之曰，你將　什麽，你將成什麽？而其回答却說我不知道者，這人優無救藥的。」設使有人問我們：你將　得什麽工作？也許我們一時無話可答。但是我們旣然大學畢業，至少我們　敢說自已能　些事，並把事做好，做多少有個値的人，過有長進的生活。不過，這樣的收積，不能從渺茫的理想，無決斷的行爲，隨大衆浮沉，或等着某處爲我們開成功之鬥而來。一你往那裏去？」我們對此問題，若決定提出有力答覆，那末我們必得有自已的理想，並且必得照理想訓練自已。我們要向上爬，要達到　最高度，看更廣大的地平線，我們就必得撤槖那低卑的衝動，逸樂自私的慾望，粗忽的生活，以及無紀律的行爲。這種種皆是引到滅亡的寬路。我們不與人同流合汚，難免被人誤會，反對，遺　，然而這不要緊，因爲高尙的理想和卑鄙的理想，善和惡總是不相容的。引到永生的門是窄的，須要我們勉勵刻苦去行。常人之情，每輕於實已，而　於責人，　如有人咒詛商人無道德，而他們自己行爲，却有破壞金融，把整個工業制度，引到滅亡的可能。又有人嘆息現代道德淪亡，而他們自己的行爲却幫着使社會腐收。還有違背上帝，不守正義，却大駡宗敎者。諸位受過大學敎育，皆爲國家優秀公民，切不宜有此等習氣。總而言之，做人只此一條路，就是；引到永生，引到成功的上帝之路。路窄門狹，不良於行，但是我們必須勉力的走，因爲除此便得不着永生。昔時曾有一位大師，向世人宣稱，說「我是道路。」我們要走他的路，做他的工作，古吟來，有無數的人跟隨他行，得了生命，從無失敗。路雖艱苦難行，我們勉力應付，我們的人生長進卽在其中。（完）</p>

<h3>申居不易鄉居難</h3>
<p>— 雁章</p>
<p>物價無止境的飛漲不已，住在上海，除去一般有錢階級以及正在「發財」者外，好說沒一家能舒舒適適的維持日常生活的。於是一般人都在說：「回到鄉下去罷？」</p>
<p>主張遷鄉間住的人，當然受到都市生活上的痛苦，以爲住到鄉間後生活即可安定了。然而遷居鄕間眞能生活安定嗎？決不！我有一位鄕親從淪陷區的常熟鄕間上來，吿訴我鄕間物價繼申地漲勢亦步步高漲。大家知道常熟是產米之區，常幫特粳很有名望的，但當地特粳價也漲至四十元一石，從前稻柴很賤，一元可買三四担，現今貴到一元祇買到五十斤。以前鄕間四野墳山上野草叢叢，誰都不注意的，現在稻柴貴了，居然有人割取這野草晒乾後充作燃料。油鹽醬醋價漲得和上海一般無二，蛋也要七分錢一只，祗有豬肉魚類等較申略賤。至於日用品價格更貴，上海固本皂賞二角一二，鄕間須三角五分。</p>
<p>總之，回到淪陷區去是迫不得已的辦法，希望上海商人稍發天良，讓大家再熬過最後關頭，那是於已於人，於國於家都有和益的。</p>

<h3>譯名不要希奇古怪</h3>
<p>— 子心</p>
<p>請採用比較熟悉的譯名　或在譯名下附英文原名</p>
<p>自從歐洲戰事開展以來，關心時車的人，恐怕又要多費一　鐘來讀報紙的罷。然而每當細心閱讀的時候，常常會引起種煩惱，有時不得不更費一些時問，去請敎地圖和書籍。這就是外國地名人名譯得太古怪！我自己承認外國地理不大高明，翻地圖道種苦頭是應該領受的，然而有時通訊社的翻譯者和編輯人也要負些責任。</p>
<p>先隨手舉二個例子罷；上次大戰中大名鼎鼎的（Sedon），這幾天在報上却有四五個化身發現，有幾張報紙譯的是「色當」，這似乎譯得最普遍，在若干可靠的史地書籍也是這個譯名。但有一二張却譯成</p>
<p>「塞丹」和「塞常」。最有趣的，某報上同一新聞却有二個根本不同的譯法，一是「塞塘」，而一是「色丹」。二者之中，「色丹」比較容易猜想到「色當」，而「塞塘」一見之下，分明作爲牠是一陌生地名了。還有道二天法德激戰所在的「末斯河」（Mons）若干通訊社譯爲一繆斯河」，這倒也如「布魯捨爾」和「白魯　爾」很容易揣想出來的，但　單是「揣想」，已足使一個細心閱報者要多費好些尤陰，這許多光陰的總和，又是多麼無謂的損失。</p>
<p>現在我不願討論譯法眞確是非的問題，我很知道譯者決不致誤譯，這不過是因無統一的名稱而各行其道而已。我希望譯者和編者，爲讀者便利起見，若下重要地名，揀個比較熟悉的譯名來用，不要譯得希奇古怪，使讀者摸不到頭路。或者，直捷了當，在譯名後附一個英文地名。</p>
<h3>「慌」與「忙」</h3>
<p>— 陳鑫奎</p>
<p>最近的上海社會，動盪和不安的形態極爲顯著，影響所及，遂使上海發生了下述的兩種新現象：</p>
<p>一種現象是「慌」。在物價飛漲聲中，經濟不充裕的人們，以每月有限的收入，作日常無限的支出，收支既然無法平衡，預算也就無從確立；豆腐高如肉價，布疋貴於綢緞，電費加了又加，房捐增了再增，衣·食·住·行，無一不難，「開源」無方，「節流」不能，生活的前途如何，根本失了把握，在這種情形之下，人心安得不慌？</p>
<p>相對的另一種現象是「忙」，「忙」是金錢作怪之故。許多資力富足的人們，在忙着享樂之外，還要忙着發財。這一個「發財忙」，就把事情忙大了。好好的法幣，硬要去變成外匯，你變我變的結果，變出一個黑市塲來，於是他們哈哈大笑，自鳴得計，以爲這一下忙着了，穩發大財。不料一個晴天霹靂，金價與美幣連袂向下直瀉，跌風之厲，創兩年來未有的新紀錄。他們苦悶之餘，覺得做空頭到底不如存實貨，急忙轉　作風，不論煤米麪粉，呢絨疋頭，甚至洋燭肥皂，花露香水，見貨就要要，統統都想拿來囤積。然天下不如意事常八九，而「在扒」「出籠」等法則，也不一定靈騐，當棧單買不着，倉庫無處尋，廠家不出貨，銷路沒辦法的時候，這班「着忙」的人物，也便團團轉地「着了慌」啦。</p>
<p>「慌」是被動的，是不得已的；「忙」是主動的，完全是自己找出來的。少數的人愈「忙」多數的人愈慌一，足見「忙」是不道德的。木來「慌」與「忙的兩種現象，在上海已早露端仰，不過它的發展，沒有今天的明顯和尖銳。今日之下，全上海的人們，幾乎非「慌」即「忙」或是「又慌又忙」；至於「不慌不忙」的人，恐已絕對沒有了半醒君鑒：尊稿已遵命交本館收發處，但因本刊篇幅有限，不能再行刋登「啟事」，並無甘他「緣故」，請即日駕臨本館領取可也。　春秋編輯室啟</p>

<p>地廿四回　湖山蕩條各有千秋　士女歡騰共呼萬歲</p>
<p>他們在那裏流連一番之後，仍舊回到自由村小學校來。路過了一個村會議室，朱村畏便請他們進去看看，便說：『這是我們村中的　一政治機關，也是我們的立法院，可要進去看看？」大家都進去了，裏面有個村政辦事處，也有兩三位事務員專司其事。只見廊下已堆有許多燈彩，邵慧華最先注意，問道：『此地另有什麽慶祝紀念的事嗎？一朱村長道：『不！道都是預備今年雙十節，慶祝國慶日用的。因爲今年是民國整整四十年了，而又是我們新村成立以後第五周紀念，我想略爲熱鬧一點。學校裏的孩子們聽了，很爲感奮，這些燈彩，都是他們在手工課裹自己紥的。他們旣然高興，我們不能阻礙他們，到那一天他們還要開提燈會游行一巡咧。』朱愛人道：『僅僅在自由村游行一巡嗎？」朱村長道：「他們與水竹村小學校約定了，說是聯合交換游行。在謝烈士僑邊會合了，我們的學生先在水竹村游行後，然後回到木村來。而且水竹學生，也到我們村中游行，最後在謝烈士橋十還敬着燄火咧。」朱愛人道：「那是到了這一天熱鬧極了。」朱村長道：「不但　咧！他們蠶種製造塲的男女職員，本來有一個話劇團，到了那一天，他們還要借了我們的大會堂，慶祝國慶，開演活劇咧。本來到了秋冬之際，他們製種塲是比較空閑的時候，他們工作之餘，藉此娛樂了。這一天，總算我們自由村快樂的一天。我的年紀老了，以後也不知道能否再過到這樣快樂紀念的一天？到那一天，你可以回到自由村來吧？現在人家　講什麽五年計畫，這村子成立了五年，我也要報吿我的第一次五年　的完成，接着便是第二次五年計劃了。』朱愛人見由祖父非常高興，便說：『我來！找一定來！」朱愛人想：我們這位老阿爹，一生也太辛苦了。一位獨臂翁，一條膀子的人，雖然年已七十餘歲，却還是爲鄕村宣勞。我是一個孤女，父親老早就過世的了，可親雖然賢惠，可惜不是高等知識階級。要是沒有我的祖父，託孤於老　醫師，何能有今日呢？但是我自從留學美國回來，服務醫院，何會有一天承歡膝下呢？（二八三）</p>

<h3>同胎五姊妹　最近的生活</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>加拿大狄安同胎五姊妹，是馳名於世界的。她們住在一座特建的精美育養所裹，由加拿大政府養育，一切皆依照科學方法，由醫學博士達福氏主管，由看護三人，敎員一人，監護訓導，這可算得最科學化的兒童敎育法了。</p>
<p>這育養所在初建的時候，孩子還小，只要幾間屋便　了。後來孩子漸長，於是房屋也逐步擴展。目前這育養所，還不過是兩層樓房，但外貌卸很壯觀。裏面有娛樂室，臥室，浴室，餐室，廚房，懲戒室，貯藏室等。總計全屋的一切設備，的値美金十萬元。那款項都是五姊妹自已賺來的。她們還在銀行中存着巨數金錢呢。</p>
<p>五姊妹生於一丸三四年五月二十八日，如今她們己是六足歲的孩子了。所以達福醫生最沂向加拿大政府，要求擴大育養所，聞政府業已照准。據達福醫生說：在本年夏季以前，將在該所四周建造長欄，把所屋包圍起來，並將所後的林區數英畝圈入。使五小姊妹除在廣大的運動塲游戲外，還能在天然林區花草之間，散步消遣而不會走失。那時這育養所將成一座小小的村莊，彷彿是世外桃源了。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>This Battle in the European War</h3>
<p>According to military news transmitted from France yesterday, it has already been admitted that the city of Laon has been abandoned. After the German army broke through the Maginot Line, it gradually advanced southwest, and the part that broke into French territory became deeper and deeper. Other military news said that the battle lines were spreading, the battlefield was vast, the battle situation was chaotic, the German army had encountered strong resistance, and in the past three days, its edge had been thwarted, and it had not advanced much.</p>
<p>The expansion of the European war to the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg took place on the morning of the 10th of this month, only twelve or thirteen days ago. Not only did the Netherlands fall without a fight, but Belgium was on the verge of total collapse. The earnest exhortations of the British and French governments to their people did not hesitate to admit that the situation was serious, and the excellence and elite of the German army were admired by almost everyone. The world's forces sympathizing with Britain and France were shocked and worried. For example, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt did his best to promote the military expansion budget and increase the efficiency of aircraft manufacturing, which shows that the overall situation is in danger. Also, those who sympathize with Britain and France even considered that if the United States failed to help Britain and France early, resulting in the defeat of Britain and France, and the British court moved its capital to Canada, the United States would be in an even more difficult position, which shows the depth of their concerns. Also, the US isolationists prominently raised their banner against participation in the war, which shows the approach of the problem. All of this can illustrate how deep the impression given by the recent battle achievements in Europe is!</p>
<p>What is the overall situation of the war? The German army's capture of cities and territories does occupy an advantage, and the German Rhine Line report also said that "now that the war has entered a mobile war from a positional war, the outcome can be determined in a few days," and it seems that the war has reached its final moment. In the face of such a serious fact, it is impossible to rely on any preconceptions or expectations. What can be based on objective facts is the pursuit of its ultimate truth: First, Germany's fundamental strategy is to fight a quick battle to achieve a quick decision. The stalemate on the Western Front has lasted for more than eight months, which is unbearable for Germany. Therefore, it violated the world's great disapproval, invading Denmark and Norway first, and then invading the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, in order to focus on today, merging its main force, and breaking through the weakness of the Maginot Line and driving straight in. This is its intention, that is, in the first eight months, Germany sought to fight a quick battle to achieve a quick decision, but it wanted to fight a quick battle but could not. Now, in terms of its strategy, it has achieved its initial grand wish and achieved a quick battle. Second, in terms of this German attack on France, the force used can be believed to be based on the standard of formation and terrain, and to use its maximum strength to adapt to this standard. On the side of France and even the Anglo-French-Belgian-Polish Allied forces, they initially selected the Maginot Line as their most reliable decisive line. When the German army changed its route and took advantage of the opportunity to attack, the Allied forces naturally did their best to resist with the maximum force allowed by the terrain and time. Therefore, the result of this decisive large-scale battle will be divided into extremely important victories and defeats after the current so-called "chaotic battle situation". Third, the German report said that "the outcome can be determined in a few days," and its words have a part that can be believed. But what is meant by victory or defeat? Is it the victory or defeat of this battle, or the victory or defeat of the entire war? It is impossible to be arbitrary today. In other words, assuming that the defeat belongs to Germany, whether Germany allows it to continue fighting in military, economic, political and other aspects, and prepare for another war is still a question. Assuming that the defeat belongs to the Allied forces, the two countries of Britain and France can at least continue to fight again in various aspects of the economy and politics, but the extent of the military losses has forced Britain and France to compromise with Germany in terms of time, which is also a question. All these questions await facts for answers, rather than the chaotic present that can be predicted. Fourth, assuming that Germany wins this battle, and assuming that Britain and France lose this battle, they will do their best with greater determination and effort to prepare for another war as soon as possible. Then the victory or defeat of the re-battle is unknown, but Germany's grand wish for a "quick decision" strategy will therefore be very distant. Fifth, modern warfare is decided by the final fight of the main force. Although the percentage of the main force used in the current battle between the two sides is bound to be higher on the German side than the percentage of the main force of the Allied forces, both sides are not the entire main force. Making a balanced and normal prediction based on this, after this battle, the remaining main force of the Allied forces should be thicker than that of the German army. Moreover, Britain and France have overseas colonies as a strong backing. As long as time allows, even if the German army wins, if it must cope with another war, the German army will probably be more difficult than Britain and France. To discuss the war in terms of the war, the overall situation is probably like this. The worries held by those who sympathize with Britain and France today, we cannot but suspect that they are excessive. What is unknowable is that Germany has really been thinking and planning for this European war for a long time, and its detailed plans are meticulous. On the British and French side, in the past few years, because of the relationship between political institutions and personnel, it has been seen that it is more lax and backward compared to Germany. Therefore, the so-called "fifth column" that Germany has deployed in the two countries of Britain and France, how it will act and how it will be effective, is an internal concern of Britain and France. At the same time, Germany, with the remaining prestige of its initial victory, also has a great deal of room for use in the international arena. Then, if the Allied forces are defeated in this battle, the international community, which is eager to take advantage of the situation, may throw stones at them, which is an external crisis for Britain and France. The two countries are fighting, initially related to the generals, decided by the team, followed by the entire military equipment, followed by the strength of the entire nation. Further decisions come to the present, and the trend of the international situation and the importance of the third party's actions all affect the two countries in conflict. In short, how the future of the European war will be, it is too early to judge, it is too early to be pessimistic or optimistic, and we must wait and see.</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Comments on Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Moscow News The Soviet newspaper recently published a special article entitled (The Chinese People Fight for the Motherland), which stated that Japanese imperialists hoped to end the war within three months, but the Sino-Japanese War has lasted for three years, and the Japanese side's losses, even in ten or fifteen years, are difficult to restore. The initiative has belonged to China. There are three reasons why the Chinese army can achieve final victory: (1) The whole country's hatred of the enemy; (2) The northwest and southwest have a huge economic base; (3) The whole country is united for the war and sincerely united. The entire Chinese nation should fight to the end under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. (Telegram of the 20th)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Writes Letter of Thanks for Donation from Chinese Soldier</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the matter of a Chinese soldier recently donating one yuan to the British War Time Fund, it is heard that the soldier wrote a letter to British Ambassador Sir Kerr on April 11, stating, "I have read in the newspaper that your country has won several victories, which is very gratifying, as it will surely awaken the aggressors and make them realize the injustice of their actions. Seeing the decline of public morality, the people of your country are now shouldering the responsibility of maintaining world peace and helping the weak, which is truly admirable. I hereby offer one yuan in legal tender, donating it to the wounded soldiers' relief fund, to express my sincere sympathy for the justice and righteousness of your country's war aims. Although this amount is small, it comes from sincerity, and I hope you will accept it with a smile. I will do my best to attract the attention of those who feel the same way as I do, and ask them to donate together, because gathering droplets can make a sea." In a reply on April 27, Sir Kerr stated, "I recently received your letter, and I was deeply moved after reading it. Your letter is very precious, because it is an expression of your understanding of the current actions of the people of our country. I sincerely thank you for your donation to the wounded soldiers' relief fund. However, during wartime, the need for funds is very great, both in your country and ours. I feel that our country needs your country's goodwill more than money. Therefore, I intend to transfer the donations from you and other Chinese friends to the "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers Association" here in the name of those who sympathize with China in its struggle against aggression. I admire your secretary's statement that you do not want this good deed to be known to the public. However, I would like to ask you to allow me to inform the press about this matter and reveal it, so that others may also be moved by it, and friends may learn about the feelings of the Chinese people towards our country. Your name will naturally be disclosed." (Reuters telegram of the 20th)</p>
<h3>People of the Four Northeastern Provinces Mostly Addicted to Opium</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to a report released today by the China Intelligence Committee, the number of opium smokers in Manchuria has now reached more than 13 million, accounting for one-third of the total population of Manchuria. This report is a reprint of an official Japanese report, which stated that Jehol Province has now become the center of opium production, not only supplying the four northeastern provinces for smoking, but also being shipped to Shanghai for sale via Dalian. The "Ministry of Finance" of "Manchukuo" collected 90.09 million yuan in opium production tax and tobacco sales tax in 1939, an increase of 28% over 1938. Opium tax revenue collected by "Manchukuo" ranked second in total tax revenue, and the 6 million yuan collected by Japan from "Manchukuo" in 1939 for its war budget was collected from opium tax (United Press, 21st).</p>

<h3>German Troops Continue to Advance Southwestward; Laon and Amiens Reportedly Lost; Situation Along the Somme River Still Very Chaotic; German Army Claims to Have Defeated the French Ninth Army</h3>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating that although battles occurred on all fronts last night, the general situation has not changed. The situation between the Somme River and the Cambrai area remains extremely chaotic. The enemy launched repeated attacks in the Laders area, but all failed. Our air force remains extremely active and has flown to enemy positions for fierce bombing. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating that the enemy continued to launch fierce attacks north and west of Saint-Quentin today. The enemy also launched an attack in the Montmédy area, which was repelled. There were no other major battles elsewhere. Our air force remained extremely active today and repeatedly conducted reconnaissance flights. Our bomber squadrons fiercely attacked enemy tank formations, dropping huge bombs to hinder their advance and inflict heavy damage. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris - The war situation on the front line remains extremely chaotic, with no significant changes. Fierce battles took place between the two sides southeast of Cambrai and in the area of Saint-Quentin and Péronne. Although the German army continued to advance westward, its offensive was not as fierce as yesterday. The city of Laon has fallen, and the residents had been evacuated long ago. In addition, the German army attempted to forcibly cross the Aisne River east of Montmédy, but failed. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>German Army Communiqué States: Absolute Victory Achieved</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command issued the following communiqué last night: Our army fiercely attacked the city of Laon and has now occupied the city, raising the German flag over the city. The vanguard continues to advance southwestward and has now reached the Oise River. Laon is located 40 kilometers northwest of Reims and 120 kilometers northeast of Paris. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - Hitler's headquarters issued a German army communiqué stating that the unprecedented largest offensive has achieved absolute victory. The French Ninth Army, which was responsible for maintaining traffic on the Meuse River from Sedan to Namur, ensuring that the enemy forces operating in Belgium would not lose contact with the Maginot Line, has been defeated by the German army. General Giraud, the former commander of the French Seventh Army, who is now in command of the Ninth Army, has been captured by our army. German divisions are now entering the gaps created by the German offensive. Tank formations and motorized units have captured Arras, Amiens, and Abbeville. All British, French, and Belgian troops north of the Somme River have been forced to retreat towards the English Channel coast. The German army in Belgium is now attacking the enemy forces concentrated east of Ghent and south of the Scheldt, who are engaging in counterattacks. After occupying Laon, the German army has crossed the Queen's Road and reached as far as the Aisne and Oise Canal. The French army lost countless tanks in one counterattack. The area of Les Essarts, where some enemy forces are still resisting, has been occupied by the German army. The German air force has achieved great results in the victorious advance. The communiqué also stated that German aircraft, while conducting reconnaissance flights over the French coast, severely damaged a French destroyer, the French oil tanker Niger, the French merchant ship Boffen, and two other merchant ships. Yesterday, six enemy transport ships and oil tankers, totaling 43,000 tons, were sunk in the Strait of Dover. It is reported that four more ships were severely damaged. The enemy's aircraft losses yesterday totaled 47, while 15 German aircraft are missing. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - German military circles announced last night that Germany's advance towards Paris and the English Channel has encircled more than one million Allied troops. According to German military officials, 350,000 French troops, 350,000 British troops, and 300,000 Belgian troops have been surrounded by the German army. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - Military experts, after studying the latest German military intelligence, stated that the main force of the German offensive in France is clearly aimed at the English Channel ports across from Dover. Germany's greatest goal is to capture Paris to create a dazzling prestige. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is secondary for the German army to go straight from the French seaports to control the English Channel with bases where cannons can reach British ports. Last night, German military sources stated that the German army had reached the Somme River. According to neutral military circles here, the German tactic is like wielding a giant axe with the Netherlands as the handle. The axe is now swinging towards the Somme River estuary and the English Channel in the northeast. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a German army battle report, German aircraft sank six transport ships and one oil tanker, totaling 4,000 tons, in the channel between Dover and Calais late yesterday. German aircraft also destroyed a French destroyer, the oil tanker "Niger" (5,582 tons), the cargo ship "Boffon," and two other cargo ships near the French coast. (Haitong dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a battle report released here, the German army occupied the town of Les Essarts today. The forts of the Namur fortress have also fallen into German hands. (Haitong dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Danzig - According to the "Politische Zeitung"'s Berlin correspondent, Britain seems to be withdrawing its expeditionary force from France to defend Britain and prepare for a German attack. The German army has attacked the Allied forces on a vast battlefield, and the Allied forces' pincer strategy has failed to stop the German advance. General Gamelin's attempt to break the German offensive, using a strategy of attacking simultaneously on both flanks with mechanized units, has failed. (Haitong</p>
<p>German Offensive Seems Rhythmic; Chaotic Fighting in the Somme Area</p>
<p>Paris - A French military spokesman said that the development of the German army's actions continues to maintain the now-famous "rhythm," that is, a large-scale advance one day and a relatively calm day the next. Yesterday was one of the calm days. Activities in the area between Cambrai and Péronne near the Somme continued to be the German army's fiercest effort. In the chaotic battle situation, the German army seems to be concentrating its efforts on occupying forward strongholds, bridges, stations, and railway junctions, and sometimes even behind French lines. The German army uses motorcycles, bicycles, light armored vehicles, and infantry columns moving in trucks, and also uses paratroopers. The air forces of both sides are very active and seem to be increasing in intensity. German bombers have attacked French communication lines, stations, railway junctions, and ports on the English Channel, and have participated in the battle with a low-altitude bombing strategy. British and French aircraft have attacked the enemy's rear near Saint-Quentin. It is reported that the results of bombing enemy trucks are very impressive. The German army lost a large number of tanks and trucks yesterday. French reinforcements have arrived in the area east of the Somme. So far, the German army's losses have been very heavy. It seems excessive to say that the ratio of German losses to Allied losses is three to one. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Allied Forces Form Raiding Parties to Stem German Westward Advance</p>
<p>Paris - According to all the news received here, although the German offensive is becoming more and more fierce, the German westward advance was relatively less advanced yesterday. Allied forces and German armored units fought fiercely north and west of Saint-Quentin (80 miles northeast of Paris) yesterday. By evening, the land occupied by the German army was very small compared to the early stages of the offensive. Allied raiding parties have now been formed to stem the German advance. The German army is confident in its strong offensive power and is advancing forward, but its flanks are now blocked, and in the center, every inch of land is being contested. The situation in Péronne, fifteen miles northwest of Saint-Quentin, is unclear. Whether the city has been completely occupied by the German army or only a few vanguards have rushed to the city is still unknown. The German army is also putting great pressure on the fortified area of Montmédy. This protruding point, which controls the Meuse River east of Sedan, is greatly hindering German operations. After the German army attacked the Maginot Line in the Montmédy area yesterday and was repelled, it attacked again and was repelled again. The German army suffered heavy losses. There is nothing to report along the rest of the Maginot Line, all the way to the Swiss border. At the same time, British troops are withdrawing further west of Brussels. This is part of the general retreat of the British army's right flank and the French army. The retreat was carried out in an orderly manner. The British troops on the Belgian front are still fighting bravely and have not suffered any losses so far. Every retreat by the British army so far has been ordered by the Allied forces for general strategic reasons, and not because the British army itself is unable to hold on. The British army in the French front is currently engaged in the most intense battle since the British Empire formed a world empire. The German mechanized units have penetrated deep behind the British lines, forcing the British army to reorganize its lines under very difficult circumstances. Although the seriousness of the current situation is not disguised, it is by no means hopeless. The German army is currently operating according to new war principles, apparently placing the safety of its rear and the vulnerability of its transportation in disregard. Therefore, there is still a possibility that the German army will advance rapidly, leaving its flanks empty and vulnerable to flanking attacks by the Allied forces. A French military spokesman announced last night that there was extremely fierce fighting east of Cambrai and Landrecies. The bloody battle lasted all day, but the German army did not seem to make any major advances. Between Landrecies and La Fère (on the west bank of the canal connecting the Sambre and Oise rivers), German armored units continued to advance northwest. The situation is still chaotic, and large numbers of tanks from both sides are engaged in mixed battles. However, on the whole, the German army is continuing to advance, and the front line in that area is serious. In the Reims area, two attempts by the German army to cross the Aisne River were completely repelled. Only a small group of German troops managed to cross the river, but they were captured afterwards. A large force of enemy infantry, covered by heavy artillery fire, attacked a bridge in Montmédy, but was repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses, occupying only one small guardhouse in the outermost position of the Maginot Line. According to last night's communiqué, the German offensive was still very fierce. A renewed German attack in the Montmédy area was repelled. There was nothing important to report elsewhere on the front line. Our aircraft were very active today, flying out on many reconnaissance missions. The bomber squadrons attacked enemy armored vehicle formations and bombed enemy columns, hindering their advance and inflicting heavy damage. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Today, some people said that the current situation on the Western Front is quite similar to that of 1916 and 1917, when the Allied forces only cared about attacking positions and forgot about clearing operations, but today's scale is far greater than in previous years. The German army is now only concerned with advancing on all roads and forgetting that there are still Allied positions guarding its rear. Inside the salient, there are still many places and positions firmly held by the French army, and from which they are launching counterattacks. Furthermore, the German tank formations are now ravaging northern France, undoubtedly spreading all kinds of alarming news. But the farther these tanks advance, the more vulnerable they are to counterattacks and destruction, as they will find it extremely difficult to obtain gasoline supplies. The advance of heavy tanks is fierce, and its impact on morale is undoubtedly extremely serious, but it has been proven in recent days that these tanks are not as invincible as initially expected, so their effect has gradually diminished. Many tank attacks have been defeated by the Allied forces, and they have suffered extremely heavy losses. They are only difficult to resist when they find a weak point and swarm in. Otherwise, there is nothing to fear. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>German Military Governors Set Up in Occupied Areas of Holland and Belgium; General Fockenhausen Appointed</h3>
<p>City of Switzerland - The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that after Führer Hitler appointed Austria Province Commissioner Ingarde as the High Commissioner for the occupied areas of Belgium and the Netherlands, General von Reichenau, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, specially appointed General Fockenhausen, the former Chief Military Advisor to the Chinese government, as the Military Governor of each of these areas, and ordered him to temporarily manage administrative affairs until Ingarde arrives in office.

<h3>British and German Air Forces Battle in the Skies Over France and Belgium; British Aircraft Groups Also Fly to Germany to Bomb Communication Lines and Oil Depots</h3>
<p>London - On Saturday and Sunday, British Air Force fighter and bomber groups engaged in fierce battles with multiple squadrons of German bombers, shooting down more than 50 German aircraft of various types, of which 34 were seen to crash. Another 16 were destroyed by British machine gun fire. The British lost slightly less than half the number of German aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry issued a communiqué yesterday stating that Royal Air Force bombers are still engaged in bombing enemy communication lines and have also attacked oil refineries in northwestern Germany with considerable success. They also bombed enemy stations and bridges south of Brussels. One railway bridge was directly hit by a bomb, and several trains were damaged. In addition, they bombed troop and tank concentrations in the Asnières area, and set fire to a truck parking lot near Sedan. This operation was carried out by a large number of bombers. Although they encountered heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire, only two did not return to base. The Værnes airfield north of Trondheim, Norway, was also bombed last night. Many enemy aircraft parked at the airfield were repeatedly bombed by bombs and machine guns, and are now believed to have been badly damaged. Seven fires broke out in the airfield. Our fighter pilots fought bravely, often engaging in combat with superior enemy aircraft groups, driving away enemy bomber squadrons that constantly harassed the Allied forces, and attacking the accompanying fighters. Almost every battle resulted in heavy damage to enemy aircraft. After refueling, they flew out again to fight. One squadron of Hurricane aircraft, while patrolling the skies over France and Belgium yesterday, engaged in combat with more than 100 enemy aircraft. In several battles, they shot down 11 enemy aircraft, eight of which were fighters. One young pilot attacked four Heinkel aircraft one by one, destroying three of them. According to the information received so far, it is confirmed that the Royal Air Force destroyed 30 enemy aircraft yesterday and severely damaged many more. We lost 14 fighters. Detailed reports of the British bombers' attack on the large oil depot in Misburg, a few miles from Hanover, Germany, have recently arrived. It is said that the operation began at almost midnight. By the time our last aircraft flew back one hour later, the fire was raging and the explosions were continuous, indicating the success of the bombing. During one phase of the bombing, seven bombs were seen hitting the target directly, causing huge explosions and several large fires. On the return trip, the Bremen oil depot, which had been bombed on Friday night, was still burning. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>London is Heavily Fortified; Precautions Against "Fifth Column"</h3>
<p>London - Following continued warnings of a German attempt to invade Britain and the possibility of "Fifth Column" activities, machine gun emplacements, barbed wire, and sandbag barriers have been rapidly deployed everywhere. Government offices have now become virtual "fortresses." From Admiralty Arch, surrounding the Admiralty buildings, passing through Horse Guards Parade, along both sides of the government offices, and up to Parliament Square, are filled with machine gun posts. Downing Street has also been fitted with machine gun posts. At the same time, workers have begun to remove the iron railings in Hyde Park to aid movement. It is reported that the courts have begun to re-investigate 3,500 German and Austrian women who may be detained. It is expected that a request to detain all enemy alien women will be made when the House of Commons meets this week. Queen's Club, a women's skating rink in London, has now been converted into a refugee shelter for Dutch and Belgian refugees, most of whom are women and children. According to them, the situation during their escape, when they were bombed by German aircraft and strafed with machine guns along the way, was extremely tragic. All the facilities in the shelter are very complete, and 60 London City Council staff members are responsible for taking care of them. Last night, another 2,000 refugees from areas near Brussels, Liège, and Leuven, including 40 babies and some young men of military age, arrived at a port on the South Coast. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Telephone communication between London and Paris, and between London and Rome, was disrupted last night. The reason is still unknown. One telegram issued from Paris was relayed to London via New York. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Germany Seeks Separate Peace with France and Belgium; French Government Has No Such Illusions</h3>
<p>City of Switzerland - Observers in neutral countries recently stated that German political figures are now using their old trick of sowing discord among the Allied countries and secretly making overtures to France and Belgium, attempting to make a separate peace. The recent change of Allied commanders has made a deep impression on them, and they believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of it. However, the country's foreign ministry officials do not harbor such illusions and frankly told neutral journalists that the change of Allied commanders is actually a sign that Britain and France are concentrating their forces to intensify their operations.

<h3>French Cabinet Holds State Council Meeting; Passes Several Substitute Legal Decrees; General Catroux Appointed Governor-General of Vietnam</h3>
<p>Paris - The Cabinet held a State Council meeting at the Presidential Palace at 7:00 PM today, presided over by President Lebrun. Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army Reynaud spoke first, expressing his gratitude to Marshal Pétain for assuming the post of Cabinet Assistant and Minister without Portfolio to assist in major planning during this critical period. He then gave a detailed report on the military situation, which was explained by Marshal Pétain. The new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Daladier, also reported on the diplomatic situation to the State Council. Subsequently, Minister of Justice Chéron reported that several substitute legal decrees had been drafted to enable the military courts to tighten their grip on certain types of crimes, especially crimes endangering national security. After the military courts have ruled on such crimes in flagrante delicto, they may be executed immediately, and those sentenced have no right of appeal. In addition, the State Council approved the orders issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Supply regarding the implementation of purchase restrictions. Colonial Minister Rollin also proposed that General Catroux, the acting Governor-General of French Vietnam, be immediately appointed as the Governor-General, which was immediately approved by the State Council.

<h3>Paris Focuses on Italy's Stance on War and Peace; British and French Troops Gather in the Near East; Soviet Troops Frequently Mobilize Near Romanian Border</h3>
<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here continue to focus their attention on Italy, as the country's ambiguous stance prevents French troops stationed near the Italian border from being redeployed for other operations. At the same time, Yugoslavia is uneasy and has already formed army auxiliary teams to prepare for any eventuality. Egypt also shares this concern and has had to take emergency measures to prevent the infiltration of "Fifth Column" elements. The speech made by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday, and the early start of summer vacation for Italian schools at all levels, are all noteworthy. Furthermore, the 22nd of this month is the anniversary of the establishment of the German-Italian military and political agreement, and the 24th is the anniversary of Italy's entry into the previous European war. All of these indicate that Italy will make a decision in the shortest possible time. The French Ambassador to the Vatican, Mr. Roux, has been transferred to the position of Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has departed from Rome to return to France. It is reported that political figures are eagerly awaiting his return to Paris so that he can report on Italy's attitude. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The fear that the European war will spread to the Balkans gradually intensified last night. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union has been conducting military mobilizations in the vicinity of Bessarabia and Carpathian Ukraine in recent hours. It is said that several Soviet divisions have been mobilized, and Soviet officials have not denied this news. The impression in official circles here is that the Soviet Union may be demonstrating its strength in order to join the war immediately should it expand into the Balkans.

<p>Rome: British and French land forces in the Near East are preparing to deal with the possibility of Italy joining the war to aid Germany. After a three-month investigation tour, this reporter has learned that the war preparations made by Britain and France in Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, and India are not, as generally imagined, aimed at the Soviet Union. Britain and France are preparing to guard the Suez Canal, Egypt, and Sudan in order to resist aggression from Italian Libya or even Abyssinia. The number of British and French troops in the Middle East does not seem as large as generally reported. The common claim of one million people is a great exaggeration; 300,000 seems closer to the truth. This reporter has seen General Weygand's troops in Syria and British, Scottish, and Australian soldiers in Palestine. These soldiers can rush to Egypt upon receiving immediate orders, as Italian Libya borders Egypt. According to reliable sources, the Australian army was originally intended to be stationed in Egypt, but because Egypt did not want too many British troops stationed on its territory, they were reassigned to Palestine. The deployments of the various armies seen by this reporter in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt are all for the purpose of supplying the Sha'am region. These deployments lead one to imagine that the troops are not preparing to fight in Turkey or the Soviet Union. Newspapers in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt are subject to censorship to prevent the leakage of military secrets. The newspapers are only allowed to discuss the possibility of a Soviet attack and are not allowed to mention the Italian issue. Egyptian authorities have also prohibited Egyptian planes from flying over the desert between Libya and Cairo. Therefore, the Italian plane that this reporter took from Cairo flew along the coast from Benghazi to Alexandria. Many military experts believe that India is the object of Soviet ambitions, and the Khurram Pass is a gateway to India, but in reality, there are no special defenses in India. Instead, Indian troops are heading to Egypt. This reporter even saw Indian soldiers stationed near the pyramids. If Britain and France were indeed defending against the Soviet Union, how could India not have sufficient defenses? Most military experts and impartial observers in the Near East agree that if Italy joins the war to aid Germany, Italy will immediately occupy the Suez Canal, Egypt, Sudan, or Abyssinia; otherwise, Italy's connection with these places will be cut off. Although the British and French forces in the Near East are each commanded by their own generals, their operational mechanisms have actually become unified. While this reporter was in Beirut, General Weygand had not yet left. Officers in the barracks strongly stated that General Weygand only commanded the French forces in the Near East and did not command the British forces. The number of officers in the British and French armies in the East is relatively large compared to the number of soldiers. These many officers are probably familiarizing themselves with the geography in order to facilitate future operations. According to this reporter's estimate, Britain has 45,000 British and Scottish soldiers in Egypt (35,000 Egyptian soldiers), 3,000 New Zealand soldiers, and 20,000 Indian soldiers. There are 20,000 Iraqi soldiers in Iraq, 30,000 British and Scottish soldiers in Palestine, and 7,000 Australian soldiers. In addition, there is a large air force. General Weygand commands a total of 100,000 soldiers in Syria. (United Press, 21st)</p>

<p>Rome: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will soon travel to Albania to inspect the development projects in the area after its occupation by Italy. Some believe that Ciano's trip is an indication that the international situation is slightly easing. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: Newspapers here recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Italy, stating that although the Italian newspapers still adopt a hostile attitude towards Britain and France, the overall situation has eased. Recently, Italian ships have resumed traveling in the Mediterranean Sea, which is clear evidence of this. In addition, Pope Pius XII's denial that he will leave the Papal Capital can also be seen as a sign that the situation is improving. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>

<h3>Turkish Government Asks Parliament to Increase National Defense Expenditure; Continues to Send Envoys to Syria to Discuss Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>Ankara: The Turkish government has submitted a proposal to parliament requesting approval to allocate 20 million pounds for special national defense expenditure. The total amount of special national defense expenditure previously approved has reached 25 million pounds. In addition, the ordinary budget also includes 25 million pounds for national defense expenditure. The Turkish government recently sent a military committee headed by Chief of Staff General Chuck Mack to Syria to discuss military affairs. Now it is continuing to send a military committee headed by Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Cohen Dous, which will set off in the coming days. General Chuck Mack is currently discussing everything with the military leaders of the Allied powers. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Reynaud Reports on the War Situation in the French Senate; French Military Nerve Center Suffers Heavy Attack; Arras and Amiens Have Both Fallen</h3>
<p>Paris: Premier Reynaud delivered a speech in the Senate this afternoon, reporting on the war situation. He said, in brief, that there is one thing that should be told to a certain country as soon as possible, namely that Generals Pétain and Weygand, the two great pillars of our army, have decided to serve the country. The two generals are now working hard on the battlefield, and their views are completely consistent with mine. At this moment, we must not have the slightest fear of shrinking back. We can no longer condone domestic traitors, cowards, and saboteurs. We must obey the great leader and trust the loyal and brave soldiers. Our air force is fighting bravely and is truly the glory of the nation. At the same time, the British Air Force is also bravely assisting in the battle, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them. (All senators stood up to pay their respects.) I firmly believe that the two great empires of Britain and France will never be defeated, nor will they perish. If someone says, "To save France, we must rely on a miracle," then I will answer, "I trust France, and therefore I trust in miracles." Since forty-eight hours ago, the enemy has continued to advance. Our cities of Arras and Amiens (the former north of Saint-Quentin, the latter west of that city) both fell this morning. The traditional concepts we have held about the way of war have now encountered two new factors: one is the in-depth penetration of mechanized units, and the other is the tactics of parachute troops. The most urgent task at present is to make a decision. Everything must be carefully planned and then acted upon in order to be successful. Recalling the early days of the last European war, although we suffered repeated defeats, we eventually won. At this moment, all citizens, both men and women, should recognize the seriousness of the current situation. During this national crisis, it is my duty to first explain the truth to the Senate and the whole country. Our defense works can be divided into two parts, as you all know. One is the Maginot Line, which starts near Basel in Switzerland and extends to Langwei near the border of Luxembourg. The other is a smaller line that extends from Langwei to the northern coast. After the three countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were invaded, our left wing attacked from the defense line between Sedan and the coast, with Sedan as the center, and advanced towards Belgium. The battle line extended from that city to the port of Antwerp in Belgium and the city of Boerduuk in the Netherlands. The enemy had long foreseen this, so they used a very large force to fiercely attack the nerve center of our army, that is, the area of Sedan and Namur in Belgium, in the Meuse River basin. As for the Meuse River, the general public often mistakenly believes that it is a good obstacle to stop the enemy, so our army deployed troops along the river. However, the battle line was long, and the soldiers were inevitably dispersed. In addition, most of the elite troops had been sent to Belgium to fight, and those stationed on the banks of the Meuse River were poorly trained troops. Moreover, the shape of the Meuse River is very peculiar, and in some places, it is impossible to use machine guns, which shows how difficult it is to defend. Not only that, but some of the bridges on the river were not blown up. This incredible mistake must be punished. As a result, the enemy armored divisions, under the cover of fighter planes, crossed the bridges and attacked our coastal defenders. Our army was insufficiently trained, as mentioned above, so it is not difficult for you to imagine how it was defeated. As a result, the nerve center of the army was lost. When I, together with Generals Pétain and Weygand, went to the Ministry of National Defense to take over affairs, our defense line had been broken by the enemy, creating a gap of one hundred kilometers deep. German armored divisions, led by mechanized units, poured in from this gap, advancing towards Paris in one direction and attacking westward in the other, attempting to reach the coast in order to encircle the entire defense line at the junction of our country and Belgium, thereby threatening the British and French allied forces fighting in Belgium. We then ordered the withdrawal of the Allied forces in Belgium on the evening of the 15th of this month. Until the day before yesterday, an enemy division had advanced to the cities of Calais, Lille, Cambrai, and Péronne, and the banks of the Somme River, and even reached the city of Amiens. In the past forty-eight hours, the German army has continued to advance, and until 8:00 this morning, I received a report from the General Headquarters that the two cities of Arras and Amiens had fallen again. So, what have we done to cause this? Is the spiritual value of our army questionable? I say no. The brave fighting of our army in Belgium at the beginning of the war can prove this. In fact, it is because the traditional concepts we have held about the way of war have encountered new factors. Today, we must not only use a large number of tanks in battle, but also the tank teams must cooperate with fighter planes. We must also find a way to deal with the enemy's conspiracy to use long-range air strikes and parachutes to disturb the rear. In addition, the enemy's workers often spread false news, or even falsely transmit orders by telephone, urging local administrative officials to evacuate residents in a hurry. Under these circumstances, you can understand that our most urgent task is to think hard and deeply. In other words, we must consider this new type of war, and then immediately make a decision. It should be known that this kind of unexpected change is not a new creation in our country's history, and our country has finally been able to overcome it. For example, in the early days of the last European war, our country was at a disadvantage due to a lack of heavy artillery and machine guns. When the enemy used shameful weapons, that is, various poisonous gases, we were caught off guard, but as a result, we were able to adapt to the environment and overcome them. It must be the same at this moment. If all our compatriots can embrace this heart, and the workers in all factories can be filled with enthusiasm for serving the country while working twelve hours a day, and all the people in the country, men and women, can recognize the seriousness of the current situation, then I believe that we will surely survive. Even from the perspective of foreign countries, millions of men, women, old, and young have begun to feel that their future has been shaken. In any case, the two great empires of Britain and France will never perish. Our confidence will not be shaken by anything. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>German Minesweeper Laid Minefield in South African Waters</h3>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph recently reported that there are several reasons to believe that a German pirate ship has been discovered in the South Atlantic. According to reliable sources, a minefield was suddenly discovered off Cape Agulhas in South Africa. It is generally believed that this minefield was not laid by the German pocket battleship "Admiral Spee" (which was sunk in Argentine waters). Therefore, it is敢to conclude that a new pirate ship has appeared in that sea area. During the last European war, the German ship "Wolf" laid mines in the same sea area in 1917. This time, probably because of the loss of the "Admiral Spee," this tactic has been adopted again. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Canada Plans to Form a Third Division, Maintain Two Divisions Overseas, and Establish a National Defense Air Force Department</h3>
<p>Ottawa: Prime Minister King declared in the House of Commons yesterday that Canada plans to form a third regular army division and establish a National Defense and Air Force Department to manage the allocation of the Canadian Air Force. It is said that the Canadian Army, including the 23,438 members of the First Division overseas, totals 100,000 people. The date of dispatch of the Second Division overseas has been brought forward, and the departure date of the First Division's replacements has also been brought forward. The recruitment of replacements for the Second Division will be actively promoted, and these replacements will be sent overseas as soon as possible. The Canadian troops in the war zone will be organized according to the methods agreed upon with the British Army Department. Regarding the air force plan, the completion of airfields, hangars, and office buildings will be expedited to accelerate its implementation. Canada has responded to Britain's request to assign naval and army units to carry out duties in the Caribbean and North Atlantic. All possible measures will be taken to speed up the training of pilots and air force personnel so that they can be sent to the front lines as soon as possible. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>US Government Promotes Great National Defense Plan; Important Meeting Held at White House Yesterday; Representatives of Aircraft Industry Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>Washington: Government personnel and more than 100 representatives of the American aircraft industry met yesterday to discuss President Roosevelt's call for 50,000 aircraft. Assistant Secretary of War Johnson delivered a speech on the spot, asking the manufacturers to complete this goal as soon as possible in the most effective way and at the lowest price. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of the Army Woodring, and Sinclair of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics also made similar remarks.

Due to the accelerated execution of existing orders, factories may need to work 24 hours a day. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Goodwill Mission Arrives in Rome Yesterday; Warmly Welcomed</h3>
<p>Rome: The Japanese delegation, led by Sato, a special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived here today. Foreign Minister Ciano, Fascist Party Secretary-General Muti, and other government officials (including the Vice Ministers of the Army and Navy) welcomed the delegation at the station. A unit of the army presented arms in salute. Italian and Japanese flags were hung all over the station, and thousands of people participated in the welcome. After welcoming the Japanese delegation, these citizens formed a team and went to Venice Square, singing patriotic songs. Later, they attempted to hold a demonstration in front of the British Consulate, but it was prevented by the military and police, and they did not get their wish. Sato and his entourage will stay here for a week, visiting various places of interest, participating in welcome parties hosted by various Fascist Party organizations, and paying respects to Italian King Emmanuel III and Pope Pius XII. They are scheduled to leave on the 28th of this month. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Summons Foreign Commanders: Discussing the Future Situation in Shanghai; US Representative Expresses Maintaining the Status Quo; No Concrete Conclusion Reached in Talks</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak and expansion of the European War, the atmosphere in Shanghai has been extremely tense. However, public order has been relatively peaceful. After Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, agreed with the commanders of the European countries' defense forces stationed in China to jointly maintain the status quo in Central and North China, the gloom was swept away. Nevertheless, the Japanese side has again seized on the issue, citing Italy's participation in the European War. Recent speeches by military and political figures in that country and the active deployment of troops in the north have made people increasingly aware of the possibility of conflict.</p>
<p>Japanese Summons Commanders for Talks</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international garrison area. The Central, French, American, and Italian defense forces are at risk of conflict at any time. To express their "concern," the Japanese Navy Marine Corps Commander, Takeda, hosted a meeting at his headquarters on the 20th, inviting the commanders of the Central, French, American, and Italian garrisons to discuss the issue of maintaining order in Shanghai. During the meeting, Takeda first presented his views, advocating for necessary joint measures regarding the defense lines of various countries' garrisons that could cause disputes. Subsequently, the American garrison representative stated that the United States, to maintain Far Eastern peace, had already expressed to countries other than Japan that maintaining the status quo was essential. He also stated that the United States was very understanding of the opinions put forward by Japan. The meeting then adjourned without reaching a conclusion that met the wishes of the Japanese side. According to the Japanese-language *Continental New Daily*, published yesterday, "The Japanese decision expressed by Takeda at this reception to 'prevent the expansion of the European War to East Asia through appropriate measures' is of great significance."</p>
<p>Notice to British Nationals: Join the Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, the British Consul-General in Shanghai has issued a notice urging British nationals to join the Volunteer Corps. The notice stated that the British unit in the Volunteer Corps used to be the backbone of the force, but its current strength has significantly decreased. It continued by saying that although British nationals in Shanghai are unable to serve in their country's military due to circumstances, joining the Volunteer Corps in Shanghai would be of equal service. The Volunteer Corps authorities have taken appropriate measures to consider the situation of British merchants, ensuring that their service does not affect their businesses. Other units of the Volunteer Corps are at full strength, so British nationals should catch up to remedy this deficiency. There are no age restrictions for Volunteer Corps members; anyone who is physically fit and capable of training can enlist. Historically, the Volunteer Corps has made significant contributions to maintaining public order in Shanghai. If any incidents were to occur in the future, it would be unfortunate if the British unit's strength were reduced due to insufficient numbers. British nationals are more concerned with the development of the European War than with protecting the interests of British nationals in China. In fact, they should recognize that protecting the security of the International Settlement is no less important than directly participating in the war. Therefore, joining the Volunteer Corps is the most appropriate way for them to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens.</p>
<p>French Nationals Ordered to Enlist</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, another group of French nationals in Shanghai, numbering 48, all under the age of 30, have received orders to report to the French Army immediately. These reservists will be trained in Shanghai and are expected to sail to French Indochina in mid-June. Since the outbreak of the European War, more than 200 French nationals in Shanghai have enlisted. 80 British nationals in Shanghai have also enlisted and have been transferred to Hong Kong for training.</p>
<p>Son of British National Missing in Action</p>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, Mr. and Mrs. Beeching, British nationals in Shanghai, recently received a telegram from the British Air Ministry stating that their son, Beeching Anthony Collin, an officer in the Royal Air Force, had gone missing in action after fighting on the 19th of this month. They would be notified if there was any news. The Beeching's son was 21 years old, born in Shanghai, and educated at a church school. He left Shanghai for England on May 21, 1937, and joined the Royal Air Force three months later. Upon hearing the news of his disappearance, the Beeching's friends expressed their sympathy.</p>
<p>German Activities in Shanghai Intensified</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, a German propaganda publication, entitled "German White Book", has been discovered in Shanghai. Its contents consist of documents taken from the German Foreign Ministry after Germany occupied Poland. However, the book does not list the publisher's name and appears to have been published in Shanghai based on the printing. The book completely blames the Allied Powers for the current war. Furthermore, according to French Consul-General Auchi, after the five German nationals moved out of the French Concession, there have been no German elements active in the French Concession. However, the French side is still paying close attention, taking precautions, and working hard to report any possible German activities within the Concession.</p>
<p>Paris Broadcasts Difficult to Receive</p>
<p>The World Wireless Radio Broadcasting Station in Paris, which could previously be broadcast directly to the Far East, has recently become inaudible, or the sound is extremely blurry when it can be received. Some speculate that this is due to seasonal conditions and is unrelated to the war. It is said that there is also a French broadcasting station in South America, which can be clearly received in Shanghai. Its broadcasting time is from 5:45 AM to 6:00 AM (Shanghai time).</p>
<p>Mrs. Gaussens Hosts Reception for Various Sectors</p>
<p>Mrs. Gaussens, wife of the French Ambassador and President of the Shanghai French Association for Aiding Wounded Soldiers, expressed her gratitude for the assistance of various sectors in the fundraising campaign held by the French Red Cross at Myers Road from the 13th to the 16th of this month. She hosted a reception at her residence on Haig Road at 6:00 PM yesterday to thank those who contributed.</p>
<p>Dutch Representative Fundraises in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Dutch Chargé d'Affaires has recently issued an appeal to all parties, requesting donations to help Dutch refugees affected by the war. The collection points are the Dutch Trading Company and the Dutch Bank.</p>
<h3>Speculation Subsides, Financial Market Stabilizes, Yen Value Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market exchange rate tightened slightly due to HSBC Bank's strong absorption of foreign exchange, while HSBC's listed exchange rate remained unchanged. The gold market rebounded due to continuous purchases by Hong Kong dealers, closing at 5,650 yuan in the morning and 5,830 yuan in the afternoon. The securities market saw a slight drop in unified government bonds, closing at 60 yuan for Class A, 51.85 yuan for Class B, 49.90 yuan for Class C, and 50.15 yuan for Class E in the afternoon. Foreign stocks have stabilized slightly. Spot goods such as soybean oil and foreign rice have risen slightly. The entire market has stabilized due to HSBC's absorption of foreign exchange. It is said that HSBC's absorption of foreign exchange is authorized by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, which is a strategy to maintain the black market exchange rate in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yen Plummets</p>
<p>According to financial sources, recent Sino-Japanese battles have resulted in the Japanese side's successive defeats, which have further caused the Japanese financial system to encounter unprecedented blows. As a result, the yen's value has been declining daily. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the yen experienced a dramatic and severe plunge, falling from the previous day's exchange rate of 113 yuan of legal tender for 100 yen to 107 yuan of legal tender for 100 yen. This means that one yen is worth 1.07 yuan of legal tender, a sharp drop of 5 or 6 fen, which is the lowest price seen in the past year and a half. At the end of last month, one yen could be exchanged for 1.28 yuan of legal tender, but by yesterday, it had fallen to 1.07 yuan, almost equivalent to the market conditions of a year and a half ago.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Pays Close Attention to Armed Criminal Behavior; Making Efforts to Establish a "Special Police Force"; Thoroughly Banning Gambling and Opium Dens in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, politically motivated armed criminal behavior, kidnappings, and other illegal activities in the Public Settlement have been frequently reported, significantly impacting law-abiding citizens. The Shanghai Municipal Council is paying close attention to this issue. The Council has received several statements regarding this matter, and the Police Department has received several statements from the Japanese Kempeitai headquarters. During the Council's regular meeting on the 15th of this month, the issue of these cases was thoroughly discussed, and it was decided to report to the Consular Body and to make efforts to improve the current situation to maintain public order.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden Expresses</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that he was fully aware of the current situation, which was consistent with the information released by the Council's Intelligence Department. Therefore, he stated that he had no further comments to make. He also stated that the number of politically motivated kidnappings this month was indeed alarming. Therefore, the Council is currently working to strengthen public order. The Commissioner of Police, Mr. E.I.M. Barrett, and the Secretary of the Consular Body, Mr. C.R. Lee, both declined to comment on this matter.</p>
<p>Source of Crimes</p>
<p>It is learned that since the robbery of Jianghai Customs duties last week, the Japanese side has lodged a protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council, mentioning the increase in criminal cases in the Public Settlement and requesting appropriate measures to be taken. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Consular Body believe that the increase in criminal cases is due to the prevalence of gambling and opium in the extraterritorial road areas and the presence of puppet troops. Therefore, they are currently working hard to establish a "special police force" as soon as possible, thoroughly ban gambling and opium, and force the puppet troops to withdraw from the area. It is rumored that the Japanese side has already agreed to this move.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Telegraphed Congratulations to Chongqing</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union, recently reported that our unprecedented victory in the Henan-Hubei campaign, all the seamen were in the midst of joy and encouragement to the rest of the world, and in addition to spreading the good news to overseas Chinese and seafarer friends through the fastest method, Chiang Kai-shek also sent a telegram to the President to pay his respects, which is recorded in the original telegram below, "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Central Executive Committee of Chongqing, I am writing to you to express my gratitude, I am writing to you to express my gratitude, I am writing to express my gratitude to all of you, the victory of the Henan-Hubei campaign, the whole country is happy and excited, your Excellency has been diligent day and night, the command is accurate, the great plan is magnificent, the prestige shakes China and abroad, the great achievements are significant in ancient and modern times, the enemy's power is invincible, the traitors and traitors are discouraged, from now on, the old and decaying are destroyed, and my homeland is restored, I hereby send a telegram to congratulate you and express my best wishes, I beg you to take care, Yang Hu, the special envoy of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and the seamen of the whole country, etc.,</p>
<h3>Queen Victoria's Birthday: British Nationals Celebrate; Simplified Celebration Ceremony; Still Inspecting Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>The day after tomorrow (the 24th) is the birthday of Queen Victoria of England, and the British people will celebrate this day as a "celebration." British people in various places will hold grand celebrations on this day as usual, but this year, due to the European situation, the British people in Shanghai will simplify the celebration ceremony. As usual, all British boy scouts, girl scouts, and cub scouts will gather at the British Consulate General Square at 7:30 AM, and the flag-raising ceremony will be held at 8:00 AM sharp. The British Consul-General, George, will inspect the exercises and deliver a speech to the boy scouts, girl scouts, and cub scouts, and then the ceremony will be completed. The ceremony at the Great Hall will not be held this year. In addition, the Shanghai branch of the two major British hospitals for the disabled's foundation committee usually holds a public charity sale of labels on the streets on this day to raise funds, but this year it will only sell them in various institutions and clubs.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador Expresses Inspiration for Fundraising Campaign; Expresses Deep Affection in the Same Situation</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the fundraising campaign initiated by Belgian students and related parties in Shanghai in response to the appeal declaration by Belgian Ambassador, Mr. Guillaume-Georges Cyriel Knight de Mülenar, all methods have been determined by the famous sculptor, Mr. Zhang Chongren, and approved by the ambassador. All proceeds from this fundraising will be used for the Belgian Red Cross to help wounded soldiers and refugees. According to Belgian Ambassador, Mr. de Mülenar, this national incident has been greatly appreciated by the enthusiastic donations from overseas Chinese and merchants in Shanghai. The fact that the Chinese people are able to automatically work hard for international relief movements in the same situation shows the friendship between the two countries and the close feelings of the people, which makes him even more inspired. When asked about the Chinese students studying in Belgium, he said that he had moved to a safe area. According to the ambassador, Belgian telecommunications have been completely cut off, and the recent situation of the students studying in Belgium is unknown. Even the current situation of his family (the ambassador himself) is unknown. However, one thing is comforting, that is, although the Belgian capital has suffered fierce bombings, the losses are still small. However, there are certainly not a few compatriots who have died, and the two forts of Liège and Namur are still in the hands of the Belgian army and have not yet fallen. The fact that they have achieved such excellent results is due to the blood and flesh of the soldiers. He couldn't help but sigh. It is said that those who donate more than 1,000 yuan can present the receipt and ask Mr. Zhang Chongren to paint an oil painting for free. The consulate and the Sino-Belgian Bank will collect donations on behalf of the embassy.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time to be Implemented This Summer</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Shanghai Municipal Council announced last week that it had approved the implementation of the "Daylight Saving Time" plan in principle. However, this plan cannot be implemented independently in the Public Settlement. It has sent letters to the French Concession authorities and various chambers of commerce requesting cooperation. It is said that the French Concession authorities have decided to fully support it and implement it this summer. It is said that the first person to advocate this was Mr. Benjamin Franklin in 1784. In 1916, the second year after the outbreak of the First World War, the British House of Commons passed a law, which was called the Summer Time Act. In the same year, almost all European countries adopted this method, and Germany was the first country to implement it, and adopted it as one of the wartime measures. After the end of the last European War, Britain continued to adopt this method, and the implementation period was from April to October every year. Other European countries have also continued to adopt it. The United States only began to adopt it after the end of the European War.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Association Opposes Collecting Relief Fees</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Countrymen Association held a joint emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by more than 30 people, including Yu Qiaqing. Important resolutions were made regarding the Ningbo fundraising method, which are recorded as follows: Resolutions: (1) If the Ningbo side raises relief funds by any disguised additional donation method, which would only increase the burden on the poor, it will not be approved and should be requested to be corrected. (2) Since both Shanghai and Ningbo have each recognized 500,000 yuan, other fundraising methods will be discussed when these funds are exhausted. (3) According to the telegram, the Ningbo side has obtained more than 300,000 yuan for the recognized amount of 500,000 yuan. If it is not possible to raise enough for a while, if the difference is only about 100,000 yuan, it will be borne by the Shanghai side. (4) The Ministry of Finance has approved the transportation of 1 million yuan of banknotes to Shanghai. In addition to the 500,000 yuan that has already been transported, there are still 500,000 yuan. Ningbo should be requested to continue to transport them to Shanghai for application immediately. If there are no banknotes, the Shanghai side should telegraph the Bank of China to allocate and transport them to Shanghai, and send telegrams to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the Civil Food Relief Committee.</p>

<h3>French Concession Special Police Begin Night Patrols; More Than 30 French Police Officers Enlist; More Than 100 German Police Officers Dismissed</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland Daily, the French Concession Police Department's special police officers were divided into teams and began patrolling the roads of the French Concession last night (the 20th) in case of emergency. According to well-informed sources, these special police officers are temporarily replacing the patrols for four days, during which each team patrols one night, from 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM.</p>
<p>Ready to Move Out at Any Time</p>
<p>From 9:00 to 11:00 last night, the French police authorities ordered the special police officers to gather for inspection, and ordered them to prepare their uniforms and inspection equipment, ready to move out at any time. According to a semi-official French person, this patrol order is a routine matter, because 35 French police officers of the French Police Department are about to leave Shanghai to enlist in Vietnam, so the special police officers were ordered to go out on patrol to become familiar with the work, so that they can take over the duties of the police officers who are about to leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Future Duties</p>
<p>It is said that the night patrol duties of the regular police officers will be taken over by the special police officers. Among the special police officers of the French Police Department, there were originally more than 100 German police officers and patrols, who have now all been dismissed, and their vacancies will be filled by Allied nationals who volunteer to take on this task. According to the current situation, the special patrol team has been assigned to the five police stations, and the entire French Concession is informed.</p>

<h3>US Post Office Stops Mailing Chinese Designated Contraband; Many American Residents in Shanghai and Qingdao Raise Objections; US Consul Has Reported to the State Department for Consultation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, American merchants in the occupied areas of China have protested to the US Consulate in Shanghai because the US Post Office has banned small parcel post to the occupied areas of China for goods listed as contraband by the Chinese government. About 300 items have been designated by the Chinese Ministry of Finance as contraband.</p>
<p>Most of these are luxury goods. The purpose of the Chinese government in prohibiting their import is to maintain China's foreign exchange. According to Mr. Boltrick, the acting Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, the Consulate has received multiple protests from American merchants in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Beiping. He has reported the situation to the US State Department and believes that it is being studied and discussed with the US Postmaster General. However,</p>
<p>Ordinary goods that are not listed as contraband are not subject to this restriction. It is said that in the protests raised by the American merchants, they also demanded that the US Post Office take more realistic steps. According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai Post Office and the Customs Office were aware of this move by the US Post Office, and the delivery of parcels sent from overseas would not be delayed. Most American merchants in Shanghai use the small parcel post method because it is cheaper and faster.</p>

<h3>Abandoned Wife and Married a New Love, "Wild Ducks" Both Detained, Each Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Dong Zhou Meifang, a Ningbo woman, is 28 years old and lives at No. 27 Dade Lane, Gordon Road. In April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, she was married by a matchmaker to Dong Yimin, a fellow villager (27 years old this year, living at No. 26 Jing'an Temple Road, head of the formal wear department of Henry Tailor Shop and owner of Fuhui Tailor Shop at No. 427 Sichuan Road). After the marriage, the relationship between the two parties was not very harmonious, and the in-laws also helped the abuser. She was forced to return to her hometown. Only in the past year did she come to Shanghai, Dong</p>
<p>treated her like an enemy, forcing her to work with the servants. Unable to bear the suffering, on August 3 last year, she attempted suicide by taking poison in room 201 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xujiahui Road. Fortunately, she was discovered and taken to Renji Hospital for rescue. From then on, Dong ignored her even more. She then requested assistance from the China Women's Mutual Aid Association to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, suing Dong for separation. The result</p>
<p>was a settlement recorded: "Dong Yimin is willing to find a proper and reliable guarantor within three days from the date of the settlement to guarantee Zhou Meifang's monthly household living expenses and rent (actual expenses, no waste). Zhou Meifang is willing to live with Dong Yimin after the guarantor is found, but not in the same house with her in-laws and sister. Both parties agree to the settlement." Unexpectedly, although Dong signed the document, he</p>
<p>did not fulfill it. She then filed a lawsuit for payment of living expenses, and the court ordered Dong Yimin to pay 40 yuan per month. However, Dong still ignored it. Until March of this year, she discovered that Dong had a new love, an affair with Fu Xueying, a woman from Pudong (22 years old this year), but she did not know where they were hiding. Therefore, she disguised herself as a man and investigated every day. Only on the night before last, at 12 o'clock, did she learn that they were living together at No. 11 Tianyou Lane, Yaozhu Bishop Road. She immediately reported to the French Concession Police Department, which sent Detective Xu Guizhu to</p>
<p>arrest them both. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police Lawyer Fei Xizhen prosecuted the two defendants for adultery. When questioned, the two defendants firmly denied it. Judge Qiu Huan Ying presided over the trial. Because the case involved morality, he ordered a ban on public attendance. As a result of the trial, the court ruled: "The main text" Dong Yimin committed adultery while having a spouse, and Fu Xueying committed adultery with someone else's spouse, each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. If they commute the sentence to a fine, each will be calculated at two yuan per day. Within the appeal period, each must pay a cash bail of 120 yuan. Without bail, they will be detained.</p>

<p>Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective of the Central Police Department, learned that someone had set up an organization at No. 594 Avenue Road in the French Concession to manufacture legal tender privately. He joined forces with detectives from the French Concession Police Department to investigate secretly at 10 o'clock the morning before last. They arrested Zhao Shida from Anhui, Danyang, Li Jinhai, and Zhang Rongda from Changzhou. They seized 4,000 fake five-yuan bills from the Bank of China and 400 fake two-corner coins from the Central Bank. They were all exquisitely printed and difficult to distinguish upon a rough look. They also seized five five-yuan photographic plates, nineteen copper plates, three printing stones, and two printing presses, which were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case and requested permission for detention in order to continue the investigation. When questioned, the defendants confessed that the organization was founded by Bao, Li, and Jin, who were at large, and that they were all assistants. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be detained for seven days for further verification.</p>

<h3>Four Robbers Hijack a Car, Return the Car After Two Hours, The Purpose of the Hijacking is Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>The Dongxin Automobile Company at No. 299 Dongxin Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, received a phone call at about 5:30 am yesterday from the Yucheng Hotel at No. 570 Hankou Road, requesting a car. Because the company had no car to dispatch, it hired a car No. 12615 from its peer, the Dongfang Automobile Company (at No. 439 Beile Road), driven by driver Dong Fazhang. After arriving at the Jincheng Hotel, four passengers boarded the car one after another and ordered it to drive to Zhenru, West Shanghai. When they drove to the north of the Wuzhen Road Bridge on Xinzha Road, one of them took out a pistol and threatened them. At that time, the driver was intimidated and obeyed orders, driving the car to a secluded place and stopping. The person who took out the gun followed and monitored him, stepping on the side of the road. After about two hours, the remaining three robbers quickly drove the car away. Until about 8 o'clock, two of the three drove the car back to its original location and returned the car to Dong Fazhang. The robbers then left. The driver reported to the fake "police station" afterwards and returned to Shanghai to report to the Lao Zha Police Station for investigation. It is suspected that the robbers may have committed another kidnapping case. The police authorities are currently investigating.</p>

<h3>Dechang Cotton Cloth Shop Found to Have Opium, Hidden Deeply in the Layered Wardrobe, Detained Men and Women Confessed to Smoking Themselves</h3>
<p>Ye Yuxi, a Chinese detective from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Patrol Room, received a tip that someone had privately set up an opium trafficking organization in Dechang Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 19 Yanyi Lane, Section 300, Chongqing Road, with a large amount of opium being traded in and out. Each transaction was at least a hundred taels. Therefore, he supervised detectives Liu Zhaonian, Li Shugui, Guo Shouxin, Zhao Baosheng, and others to secretly go to Dechang Shop with a search warrant from the Special Court at 11 o'clock the morning before last. They found that Dechang Cotton Cloth Shop was opened by Zhu Zhitong from Hangzhou, who lived there with his wife, Wu. On the surface, they</p>
<p>operated cotton cloth, but in reality, they sold opium. After a detailed search, they discovered the secret. Zhu and others had specially manufactured the furniture in the room. All the five-drawer cabinets and wardrobes had hidden compartments. If you didn't look closely, it was difficult to see through them. They found 86 taels of Yun soil with stamps on it in the interlayer of the five-drawer cabinet and 46 taels of opium in the hidden compartment of the wardrobe, worth five or six thousand yuan. They also found two opium lamps, two opium pipes, and four seals, along with</p>
<p>the furniture with hidden compartments, and took them all to the Chengdu Road Police Station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendants had been collecting and hoarding opium at low prices, and now they are trying to sell it because the price has skyrocketed. When questioned, Zhu Zhizhang confessed that Wu was not his wife, but his sister-in-law. He opened a Dechang Cloth Shop on Chongqing Road. The opium belonged to his sister-in-law's mother. When questioned, Zhu Wu also confessed that the opium was gradually</p>
<p>bought and eaten by her mother before her death. Her mother passed away in March. Because she also smokes opium, she did not sell it. Judge Xiao Peishen ordered that the case be further investigated and ordered them to be detained for a later hearing. The stolen goods were stored in the warehouse first.</p>
<h3>Guard Extorting Prisoners</h3>
<p>Zhao Xinyu, the warden of the Second Special District Prison in Shanghai, knew since taking office that the guards often colluded with prisoners to extort money from their families for their own use. Therefore, he ordered strict measures to eliminate the accumulated malpractices. At about 3 pm the day before yesterday, the head guard Yu Qingbai checked the off-duty guard Zhang Dianchen at the iron gate on the third floor and found him suspicious. They found a note from the fraud prisoner in his pocket and a letter asking the prisoner's family for money from the bedside in his dormitory.

<h3>Korean Man Stabs Someone with a Knife, Injuring an Old Clerk</h3>
<p>A certain Korean man at No. 118 Caishi Road, French Concession, sells white flour and makes a lot of profit. Some nearby hooligans gathered a group of people at about 10 pm last night and broke into his room, demanding money from him. An argument ensued, followed by violence. Because the Korean man was outnumbered, he was slightly injured. Before long, the hooligans all dispersed. The Korean man quickly ran inside, grabbed a sharp knife, and went out in a panic. A certain old clerk named Cheng Zitian (28 years old) from a certain bank met him head-on. Without asking why, the Korean man stabbed him in the chest with a knife, about an inch deep, breaking his ribs. He fainted and fell to the ground. Later, someone called the police to rush to the scene, but the Korean man who committed the crime had escaped. Cheng was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

<p>The Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday, informing all dog owners in the concession that if they have not yet obtained a dog license for this year, they should go to the Donations Section of the Council, Jing'an Temple Road, Gordon Road, or Yangshupu Police Station to apply for the license. Those who apply before July 1 will pay a fee of 5.5 yuan, and those who apply after July 1 will pay a fee of 7.5 yuan, including surcharges.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We are instructed by our clients, Mr. Chen Shaoji and Mr. Chen Xiaozeng, to state that they have read a news article in the Shen Bao on the 19th of this month regarding a lawsuit filed by Taichangxiang Shipping Company against Tongsheng Company for breach of contract in ship chartering, which briefly stated that our client had engaged lawyer Zhang Danping to argue that he had withdrawn from the partnership. Yesterday, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court ruled that the defendants should pay the full amount and that the litigation costs should be borne by the defendants, including Chen Shaoji and Zeng Jizhi, etc., which is inconsistent with the facts. Our client was involved in a lawsuit with Taichangxiang Shipping Company due to the ship chartering incident of Tongsheng Company. However, our client has always valued integrity and refused to compensate because he actually had legitimate reasons for withdrawing from the partnership and resolutely defended the lawsuit. Fortunately, the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court ruled fairly that our client won the case. The main text of the judgment stated that the defendants Zeng Bingsen, Rao Zihe, Liu Mengwo, Zeng Yiping, Wang Wei, Liu Zhenhui, Wu Jixian, Liu Nianhua, and Liu Zihua should jointly and severally compensate the plaintiff 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, and 72,365.01 yuan in national currency, plus statutory interest calculated at 5% per annum from the date of filing the lawsuit to the date of execution. The remaining claims of the plaintiff were rejected. The litigation costs, except for those incurred by the defendants Zeng Jizhi, Chen Shaoji, Huang Ruhao, Yao Rongyuan, and Dai Wenlin, Cheng Ji Shen Zhuang, should be borne by the plaintiff, and the remaining costs should be borne jointly and severally by the defendants. Therefore, it is clear that the judgment ordered the plaintiff to bear the litigation costs incurred by our client. This news must be based on inaccurate rumors. As it concerns our client's business reputation, we have entrusted your lawyer to send a letter to the Shen Bao requesting a correction." We, the lawyers, have combined to send the letter as above, hoping that your newspaper will approve the publication of the letter for the purpose of clarifying the historical record. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Danping, May 20th.</p>

Qingyun A has dominated the Shanghai table tennis championships for the past two years, winning all the titles. However, the dispersal of team members in this session has had an impact. Their defeat to Gonghua last night can be considered a crushing defeat. The fatal blow was the defeat of Fang Keping of the third group to Chen Qinglin of Gonghua. Seeing the loss on the front line, Lu Hanjun of the fourth group was discouraged and lost the match. It will be difficult for them to win the championship in the future. The finals are likely to be a contest between foreign teams and Huayi A. In the second match, Huayi A defeated Qingyun Xin by a score of 4-3.

<p>The Women's Christian Association Table Tennis Team General Test, Yang Bingdi Ranked First, Second Zhang Yixuan Third Fang Yangchu, Gathering Next Tuesday to Organize a Strong Team</p>
<p>The third women's table tennis training class organized by the Women's Christian Association held a general test in the main hall of the association at 4:00 PM yesterday. Many female guests attended. Chen Linsheng and He Xuchu presided over the assessment. Only a few trainers were absent for various reasons. The method of testing in this session was the promotion and demotion competition system, which was extremely strict. Everyone fought hard, which was very tense. The high level was even better than expected, which was greatly praised by the audience. As a result, Miss Yang Chengdi, who uses a chopping style, overwhelmed the generals and won the first place. Zhang Yixuan and Fang Yangchu, who use the looping style, won the second and third places respectively. Miss Zhang Dexin, who is excellent at short blocks, ranked fourth due to a little bad luck. The competition admitted the top ten most outstanding players, who will be gathered next Tuesday to organize and compete with the outside world for more experience. The list of the top ten names and the comments made by Chen Linsheng, the instructor, on the top four performers are recorded below:</p>
<p>List of Winners</p>
<p>(1) Yang Chengdi (2) Zhang Yixuan (3) Fang Yangchu (4) Zhang Dexin (5) Bao Yundi (6) Zhu Huiwen (7) Gu Xiulian (8) Gu Juanxin (9) Zhou Yaqin (10) Qingzhu</p>
<p>Brief Evaluation of Skills</p>
<p>(Yang Chengdi) Formerly from Minli Girls' Middle School, good at chopping the ball. Since registering for the Women's Christian Association training class, she has practiced diligently and progressed rapidly. Her chopping has become more stable, and she can also loop. She is calm in battle and has stamina. This time, she made a name for herself and won the first place, which was by no means a fluke.</p>
<p>(Zhang Yixuan) Extremely tall and skilled in volleyball, she is good at running, and her looping is excellent. Her defensive skills are not yet well-developed. Once she encounters offensive players, it is difficult for her to show her strengths. It is a pity that she has too many other sports interests, and she has not been seen to concentrate on table tennis training. Otherwise, her progress would be more than this.</p>
<p>(Fang Yangchu) Quite plump and with poor eyesight, she relies on her good talent to win third place, which can be said to be not easy. Her skills include both looping and blocking. During the competition, she can always fight hard and not show any laziness, which is commendable.</p>
<p>(Zhang Dexin) A top student from Jianshu Girls' Middle School, her skills include both offense and defense, and she is especially good at short blocks. She is agile and has a beautiful playing style. She is rare and young. If she is willing to put in the effort, she is truly an all-around talent, and her future prospects are the most promising.</p>

<h3>Finance, Foreign Exchange Situation Changes, Sterling-Dollar Exchange Market Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listed rates. In the sterling-dollar grey market, with increased buying, the trend reversed and became softer. The reason is that the situation of the Allied powers in the European war has slightly stabilized. The flying remittance rate is 5.75, and people's minds are inevitably slightly affected. The initial opening saw sterling flat and the dollar slightly firmer. Chinese merchants tried hard to buy, but there was a lack of supply, and the market immediately tightened to 4 pence 125. The dollar only closed at 5.625 yuan. Suddenly, foreign news reported that telephone lines in Central, France, and Italy were interrupted, and the situation in Europe was serious. Sassoon vigorously pushed up sterling, and Japanese banks and yarn mills frantically sold dollars. Speculators once again increased the price, and the market immediately tightened to 4 pence 21875 and 5.75 yuan. However, HSBC vigorously absorbed, and Japanese firms also bought. Near noon, the market tightened again. Foreign banks such as Youli were still keen to buy, and Chinese merchants slightly eased their buying efforts. The market trend gradually tightened, and it weakened directly to 4 pence 0625 and 5.5 yuan at the close. Sterling rose 1.71875 and the dollar rose 0.25. It is said that the Exchange Equalisation Account committee, HSBC, and other banks bought as much as £210,000 sterling, which is also one of the reasons for the tightening of the exchange market.</p>
<p>Sterling-Dollar Exchange Rate Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London big bill was down 0.875, the long-term bill was down 0.625, and the New York silver market remained flat. The London gold price was fixed, and the sterling-dollar exchange rate did not move. The exchange rate for Shanghai rose by 0.15625, and the exchange rate for France did not change. The dollar rose by 0.0575 against sterling, rose by 0.2 yuan against Shanghai, and rose by 0.03 yuan against France. The central bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. The banks' morning opening spot selling price was 4 pence 234375 for gold and 5.78125 yuan for the dollar, which was 0.03125 yuan higher for sterling and firmer for the dollar compared to the previous day's evening closing. This was due to the rebound in the exchange rate. After the opening, the potential trend was unstable. Chinese merchants and speculators first came to buy, and there was a lack of sellers, so the price softened. Initially, foreign firms offered Chinese speculators a May dollar exchange rate of 5.6875 yuan and 5.9375 yuan. Later, Chinese speculators absorbed the American dollar from banks at 5.5625 yuan. At that time, the spot sterling price was as low as 4 pence 125 and the dollar price was 5.625 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 4.5%. Later, due to a surge in selling by Japanese banks and rumors of a disruption in telephone lines in Britain, France, and Italy, people's concerns about the European war changed. Therefore, Chinese merchants and speculators turned from buyers to sellers. Japanese banks and Japanese yarn mills started selling off. However, the Exchange Equalisation Account committee purchased 60,000 to 70,000 pounds sterling, so the buying and selling were able to offset each other, and the easing trend was more moderate than before. Currently, Japanese firms are selling dollars to foreign firms at 5.71875 to 5.75 yuan. Chinese speculators are selling May dollars to foreign firms at 5.6875 yuan and 5.71875 yuan. Sassoon's offer to HSBC was 4 pence 15625 yuan for spot sterling. By noon, Japanese merchants such as Mitsui were suddenly coming to buy, but the sellers had gradually dispersed, and the market once again gathered. As a result, sterling was 4 pence 125 and the dollar was 5.625 yuan. May sterling was 4 pence 109375 and the dollar was 5.59375 yuan. June sterling was 3 pence 953125 and the dollar was 5.34375 yuan. Sterling was up 1.09375 and the dollar was down 0.05625 compared to the morning. Futures all contracted.</p>
<p>HSBC and Hong Kong Banks Both Absorbing</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the tightening trend became more acute. Initially, Youli bought May dollars from foreign firms at 5.5 yuan. Later, foreign firms briefly made a deal for June Central Gold at 3 pence 90625. Moreover, it was learned that the Exchange Equalisation Account committee had absorbed more than 100,000 pounds sterling, which made the market even tighter. Before the close, Chinese speculators had delivered May dollars to foreign firms at 5.46875 yuan, and June dollars were only 5.25 yuan. The closing price was 4 pence 0625 for sterling and 5.5 yuan for the dollar. This month's sterling was 4 pence 03125 and the dollar was 5.46875 yuan. Next month's sterling was 3 pence 875 and the dollar was 5.21875 yuan. Spot sterling was down 1.71875 and the dollar was down 0.25 compared to the previous day. May and June sterling were both up 0.1875, and the dollar was also up 0.25.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Banks Absorbed Again, Gold Prices Rebounded and Rose, Closing at 5,830 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold grey market fluctuated upwards. The fluctuations between the two days were enough to offset each other. People's minds were all swayed by the news of the European war, and the market price followed the exchange market's changes and rose and fell. The buying atmosphere was strong early in the morning, and reports of shrinking foreign exchange also increased the market price. The opening price was 5,700 yuan. Later, it was first sold by silver number money exchange firms, and it was once pressed down by 50 yuan. Finally, due to the gradual increase in demand, securities firms and gold firms purchased in unison, and the price returned to 5,720 yuan. However, soon rumors spread that the telephone lines of Britain, France, and Italy were interrupted, and news of tightening foreign exchange caused a sudden surge in selling, and the price once fell sharply to 5,470 yuan. Fortunately, at noon, retail investors and gold firms were still strong in buying, and the market closed at 5,650 yuan. The after-market was even better, because Hong Kong banks absorbed and short sellers urgently covered their positions. From the opening of 5,640 yuan, it rose sharply to 740 yuan. Although securities firms sold some at the end, the result was that gold firms bought up to a high price of 5,830 yuan, which was 330 yuan higher than the previous day's reconciliation. The entire day's transaction was very active, with more than 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry was priced 30 yuan higher, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose by 330 Yuan</p>
<p>Since early in the morning, each bar (ten taels), the exchange market opened tight, and people's minds were firm. First, gold firms absorbed 20 taels from silver numbers, for 5,700 yuan, which was 200 yuan more than the previous day. Later, the price fell back 50 yuan due to the selling by money exchange firms and silver number firms. Silver numbers sold 50 taels to retail investors, for 5,650 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market remained tight, and securities firms and gold firms bought each other again, and a certain silver number also ate well, and the price rose again by 70 yuan. Money exchange firms entered 20 taels for securities firms, for 5,750 yuan. However, at this time, the market suddenly rumored that the telephone lines of Britain, France, and Italy were interrupted, and foreign exchange was rapidly eased, and people's minds turned. On the counter, there was a piece of selling, and floating gains were sold one after another. Silver numbers repeatedly sold short. Although a certain silver jewelry firm bought in at a limit price on behalf of customers, the short position was still oversupplied. Before long, the price fell by 250 yuan. Silver numbers sold 30 taels to securities firms, for 5,470 yuan. After this, the exchange market suddenly tightened again, and the selling gradually dispersed, while money number firms turned from selling to buying, and gold firms came to drag in again, and 190 yuan was raised. Gold firms entered 30 taels for silver numbers, for 5,660 yuan. Then silver number firms entered 30 taels for gold firms, etc., for 5,650 yuan as the noon closing price. The market opened slightly lower by 10 yuan in the afternoon, and gold firms made 10 taels, for 5,640 yuan. Then, the exchange market reported a soft tone, and the buying wind suddenly intensified. Gold firms and a certain silver jewelry firm bought in again on behalf of Hong Kong firms, and a certain silver number also urgently covered their short positions. The price soared 100 yuan. Gold firms sold 100 taels to money exchange firms, for 5,770 yuan. At that time, there were fewer buyers, and securities firms and a certain gold firm sold out a few, falling back by 90 yuan. Money exchange firms sold 10 taels to securities firms, for 5,650 yuan. After that, a certain silver number saw the low and entered again, and Hong Kong firms re-acted, and the foreign exchange remained tight, and there were very few sellers. By the time of the late closing, it soared by 180 yuan. Gold firms entered 20 taels for silver numbers, for 5,830 yuan, as the late closing price. As a result, it rebounded by 330 yuan compared to the previous day, with an upward and downward range of 360 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold number's brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few who did business.</p>
<p>Jewelry Changed to 600 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was still 570 yuan at Datong Hang. At 9:30, it was listed 20 yuan higher, and it fell back 10 yuan after more than 10 minutes of refining. At 11:00, it fell back a small 10 yuan again. At noon, it was listed a big 10 yuan higher again. At 3:30 PM, it was 10 yuan higher again. At 4:00, it was 10 yuan higher again. As a result, it was up 30 yuan, and Datong Hang changed to 600 yuan. The new price was the same as the previous price, and the purchase was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a strong buying by Hong Kong firms, so sterling and gold pounds rebounded sharply. The need for sterling notes increased sharply, and the market price rebounded greatly. The need for dollar notes increased sharply due to the sudden tightening of the black market dollar exchange rate. The evening market rose to 18.15 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose in line with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, there was demand for currencies such as French francs, Singapore dollars, Annamite dollars, Robi, Canadian dollars, and Philippine dollars, and market prices trended upwards uniformly. However, the supply of Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the evening market fell to 1.08 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained even, and the evening market remained at 0.92 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discounted Bills of Exchange Showed Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange continued to trend weak. The discount rate per thousand yuan remained between 113 yuan and 118 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than the previous day. The Money Industry Association's overnight interest rate was listed at 0.26 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities, Small Transactions of Foreign Stocks, Bond Market Weak Again</h3>
<p>The securities grey market fell sharply again yesterday. After the opening, floating gains were sold off first, and the market suddenly became weak. The price gradually decreased with the high pressure of selling. The tightness of silver is a major obstacle to all parties. At present, the arbitrage trade has not exceeded the ordinary mortgage rate, because the foreign exchange is increasing step by step. Therefore, the silver can be relaxed. Perhaps we can see the light in the future of public debt. In the morning, Lianhe suddenly sold off in large quantities. Yi Tai, Ding Kang, and Ren Chang also followed the trend. Hong Kang, Le Mao, and other stocks also resisted slightly. The third class of stocks withdrew to 50 yuan. Retail investors still had more sellers and fewer buyers. In the afternoon, Lianhe and Ren Chang continued to sell. Hong Da had more sales. 41 entered Bing and sold Jia. Yong Kang and Tong Kang had more needs. The market was relatively stable. As a result, all stocks returned small four corners to six and a half corners. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is shown below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 60.30 60.00 60.00 Down 0.50</p>
<p>Unified B 52.00 51.85 51.90 Down 0.40</p>
<p>Unified C 50.10 49.70 49.90 Down 0.45</p>
<p>Unified D 48.70 48.55 48.55 Down 0.45</p>
<p>Unified E 50.30 49.95 50.15 Down 0.60</p>
<p>In stock transactions, 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were transacted at a price of 8 yuan each. The public mood in the stock market seemed to be relaxed and not as tense as in previous days. The heavy delivery of the past few days has been safely completed. There are many large losses in this delivery account, so it is not wrong to see that the market's economic power is abundant.</p>
<p>The total transaction volume yesterday was about 100,000 shares less than the previous day, but brokers were still busy because most of the transactions were limited to small orders. Due to the improved news of the European war, the opening market trended upward. Unfortunately, this trend did not last long. Because the sellers were more abundant, the price fell again. The types of stocks involved in the transaction were more popular than before. British United was still the first, followed by Jardine Matheson shares. The closing market was very stable. Rubber stocks trended softly, and buyers were very interested and had few transactions.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Monday) Telegram The price of Chinese foreign debt remained unchanged today. The listed market prices of British Far East company stocks and bank stocks continued to fall. Jardine Matheson Bank shares continued to fall by 5 shillings to 8 pounds and 10 shillings, and HSBC Bank shares fell by 2 pounds. The price of London registered shares was 78 pounds, and the price of Hong Kong registered shares was 80 pounds. The rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Food, Foreign Rice Price Fluctuates</h3>
<p>In the rice market yesterday morning, because the high water level on the upper day said that the various goods had fallen by more than two yuan, the trading was only waiting for gold exchange news. The intention was set, so there was no access to the city. It was not until the news of the gold market was stable that the activity began. The inland village customers took the lead in searching for cheap goods. The absorption was also very strong, so the situation felt stable. The opening price was 46 yuan, and compared with the previous day's afternoon grazing price of 45 yuan, it has been raised by one yuan. After that, the two sides entered and exited from time to time, and the buying and selling were very active, but the market suddenly dropped, fluctuating and unstable. At the highest time, the small cable was called 47 yuan, and this price was never realized. The market closed at 46 and a half yuan, which was similar to the previous morning's closing price. The other goods were also the same. It is estimated that No. 1 Chen Saigon is still 50 yuan, No. 2 is 47 and a half yuan, 47 yuan, fire cable is 48 yuan, No. 1 Siamese cable is 48 and a half yuan, 48 yuan, No. 2 is 46 and a half yuan, 46 yuan, and Tokyo is 45 and a half yuan, 45 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice fluctuated sharply yesterday, and the rise and fall were unpredictable, but the results were about one yuan higher than the price of the previous day. It was attracted by the rising gold and exchange rate buyers. The actual sales were as good as the price, and speculation was active again. The selling price of each rice was gradually increased again. The small rice was the most lively and active in the market. The opening price in the morning was 45.5 yuan, and the price rose from 45.7 yuan to 46.5 yuan. The morning closing price was 46.3 yuan. At one point in the afternoon, it rose to 46.8 yuan, and then fell to 46.1 yuan. The evening closing price was 46.5 yuan, about one yuan higher than the previous evening. The other rice also rose and fell again. The original package of No. 2 Saigon was sold for 61 yuan to 61.3 yuan. Tens of tons were sold, and there are about 6,000 bags of existing rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Guo rice arrived in better shape, with only one or two thousand bags in total. It is rumored that the unofficial price of Japonica rice in the outer market has been stable due to the stable price of foreign rice, and people's minds have been quite settled. There has been no increase or decrease in the selling price, and the market transaction of glutinous rice has followed with no major changes.</p>
<p>The foreign rice in this city is continuously transported to Ningbo. Zhenmi is classified as belonging to it. Yesterday, Hualun Foreign Company Ruitai Wheel went to Ningbo and loaded more than 3,400 bags. Today, Hai Fu and Avi Mali will sail to Ningbo, and thousands of bags will be transported to it (Zu).</p>
<h3>Flour Basically Selling With Slight Movement, Mill Prices Were United Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, an investigation of the number two flour mill's price list showed that after a reduction of twenty cents the day before, retail transactions in this district had increased slightly compared to before. However, the price of the old "Car Brand" flour was still fourteen yuan the day before. Because the mill prices of Fuxin and Feng once differed, the retail price of old "Car Brand" flour was fourteen yuan and five cents, while Fuxin Brand was only thirteen yuan and nine cents. It is reported that starting yesterday, the price was uniformly changed to thirteen yuan and nine cents, and the retail price of each mill was uniformly thirteen yuan and eight cents, so the local sales have seen a slight increase. As for sales to other areas, they are still quiet. Inland flour prices have been softening for days, affected by the environment and mill price depreciation. Yesterday, it was reported that local flour prices in Wuxi had risen. The trend of inland flour is gradually stabilizing. Shunfeng Brand was quoted at thirteen yuan and three and a half cents. Returns were quiet on both supply and demand sides, with few transactions for the time being. The overall market situation is still brewing. Also, 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Recently, wheat transactions have been stalled for a long time. Because the order to sell old wheat has already been issued, and new wheat has not yet entered the market. Generally, it will be available in about ten days.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that a ship of foreign wheat arrived yesterday, estimated at more than 7,000 tons. This is the wheat previously ordered by the Shanghai flour mills, which was shipped out last month. Currently, the European war is serious, and it is feared that there will be problems with future supplies. However, this news has not yet been confirmed by the mills.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Foreign Cotton Turns, Yarn Also Flourishes, "Double Horse" Rises Fifty-Five Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, rebounded slightly yesterday. This is because current yarn sales are still relatively strong, and at the same time, the overseas cotton market improved slightly, which slightly stabilized people's hearts.</p>
<p>The opening of current yarn trading in the morning was boosted by the simultaneous rise in the American and Indian cotton markets, and the buying sentiment in the market turned fiery. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,300 yuan, up twenty to thirty yuan. Shortly after, news came that gold prices were sluggish, and the price trended downward again. Soon after, it was reported that actual sales to the Guangdong merchants were still good, and prices slowly advanced again to 1,340 yuan. Finally, due to mediocre foreign exchange rates, the price fell back again. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, 1,514 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by fifty-five yuan. Today, 125 pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo, and another 950 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by various merchant groups is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 660 Fellow Traders 810</p>
<p>Yunnan 44 Total 1,514</p>
<h3>Unpredictable Changes in Overseas Markets, Cotton Merchants Wait and See</h3>
<p>The transaction of local cotton opened slightly, and the market atmosphere has entered a stable path. However, the buying and selling among fellow traders is still not as prosperous as in the past. The reality is that the world situation is still in unpredictable change, so the market is wavering and unstable. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Dazhongji 26.00 Fellow Traders in 60 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou 123.00 And 90 bales</p>
<p>Bai Luo Qu 240.00 and 24.00 200 pieces</p>
<p>Huocao Bao 205.00 and 136 bales</p>
<p>Tongda Bao 237.00 and 82 pieces</p>
<p>In addition, regarding foreign cotton market prices, the fine cotton market initially opened higher due to purchases by speculators, and then strengthened again due to purchases by spot traders and short covering. As a result, the closing price was about 27-28 to more than 30 pounds higher than on the 6th. Indian swift cotton is expected to rise nine rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was very quiet yesterday. All parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the unstable situation and excessive fluctuations in exchange rates. The Tianjin merchant group's purchases are also very sluggish. The prices of American cotton futures, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American middling 417.7</p>
<p>And Lower grade 417.50</p>
<p>32-count And 251.30</p>
<p>And Lower grade 342.20</p>
<p>42-count And 4.80</p>
<p>And Lower grade 344.50</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Foreign Exchange Shrinks, Eastern Cloth Revives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Eastern piece goods market was weak first and then strong. The white goods leader, fine cloth, initially opened lower because actual sales were still weak, falling from forty-two yuan to thirty-nine yuan and seven and a half cents. Although the market was closed in the afternoon, various foreign firms and fellow traders still traded as usual. The Qinhuangdao merchants in the North Road continued to purchase more than 700 pieces of medium and low-grade fine cloth. Fellow traders in this district were motivated by the shrinking foreign exchange and the rise in the bullion premium, and ordered more than 500 pieces of fine cloth and serge for the next month. For a time, the situation tightened, and the current price of fine cloth rose to forty-two yuan and seven and a half cents, and the next month's trading opened at forty-six yuan and five cents. The current price of "Four Gentlemen" plain serge increased to one yuan, one dime and five and a half cents, and the price for next month was one yuan and two dimes and seven cents. Even the long-sluggish medium-grade fine cloth of various brands has increased by one and a half to two yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Also, 30 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Ningbo today (the 22nd), 385 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 770 pieces will be shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Active Sales of Yellow Soybeans, Oil Price Rebounds by Two and a Half Yuan, Soybean Cake Also Up Two Dimes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains, oil, and soybean cake market situation saw a slight improvement due to the easing atmosphere, relaxed environment, and people's hearts were slightly relaxed. Therefore, various market prices turned from weak to stable, oil turned to rise by two and a half yuan, and soybean cake also increased by two dimes. The soybean market, in a weak situation, was stabilized immediately, and transactions became active as a result. Japanese oil extraction factories bought five or six carts of Bengbu beans for twenty-three yuan and three and a half cents. Exporters to Shantou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou bought more than 2,000 bags of Anqing beans at prices ranging from twenty-three yuan and four dimes to twenty-two yuan and seven dimes. Local hoarders inquired about 400 bags of Wuhu beans at prices of twenty-two yuan and five dimes to twenty-two yuan, mulberry beans more than 22 yuan, and Pinghu patterned beans at three to four hundred bags, prices of twenty-three yuan to twenty-two yuan and five dimes.</p>
<p>Also, 1,420 bags of soybeans and 500 bags of sesame will be shipped to Hong Kong today (the 22nd).</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, coarse white sugar saw a slight rebound due to the reduction in foreign exchange. The guild's quoted price for spot goods of No. 24 coarse white sugar from local warehouses was seventy yuan to seventy yuan and a half. The price for goods from outside lines was sixty-nine yuan to sixty-nine yuan and a half in the morning, and the same in the early afternoon, before rising to seventy yuan. The price for transshipped goods was fifty-five yuan, one dime to five dimes in the morning, and fifty-five yuan and a half to fifty-six yuan in the afternoon, all up one yuan. Taikoo car white fluctuated greatly. New goods of B mark were eighty-two yuan and eight dimes, old goods were eighty-two yuan. New goods of HX mark were eighty-one yuan and eight dimes. H mark car red was sixty yuan and five cents, Dutch red was sixty-three yuan and a half, one dime. Local factory snow white was seventy-one yuan, No. 1 crystal ice was ninety-five yuan, crystal clear ice was ninety-six yuan and a half. The price of national sugar, Diaoging, was high due to production, and there was talk of prohibiting exports, so some customers wanted to sell it at seventy yuan, but Qingtang sugar can never be more expensive than white sugar, and the official quoted price was sixty-five yuan, with no transactions. Also, 2,100 dan of Qinglan sugar arrived yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Drops Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>The price of white coal, since the exchange market eased yesterday, various foreign coal prices have fallen in secret trading. Fellow traders are dismantling their positions, generally quoting ten yuan lower. Hongji white coal is quoted at 206 yuan per ton, Fufeng white coal is 212 yuan, and so on. The above prices are for fellow traders to pick up from the warehouse by themselves. The local merchants add a commission to the quoted price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Silk Continues to Be Dumped</h3>
<p>In the silk market, new white factory silk of seven or eight fen continues to be dumped at a price of 5,050 yuan original price. It seems that foreign firms are soft on the price, so they are afraid and are buying 20 dan. The price of Zheng Brand Qilin grade silk from Jilijing is 2,400 yuan, and the price of the deputy brand Running Horse grade is 2,300 yuan. Dachang Bank has imported a total of 60 dan. The transaction of double palace coarse silk of 30 dan is quite firm, because the inventory is very small.</p>

<h3>Witchcraft and Shamans</h3>
<p>The discourse on witchcraft and shamans has existed since ancient times. The most ancient, Wu Xian, even took it as a surname. Confucius said, "One should not practice as a witch or physician." Mencius said, "The same goes for shamans and craftsmen." The affairs of witchcraft and shamans were acknowledged even by sages and worthies, hence the Zhou Rituals specifically established an office to oversee them, indicating their long-standing origin, with no one ever arising to denounce them entirely. However, the so-called shamans of old merely presided over matters of prayer and sacrifice, akin to scribes and historians, using their familiarity with ghosts and spirits to convey sincerity. They were unlike the shamans of today, who employ magic for their deceitful practices. In ancient times, humans were closer to the divine, hence the Spring and Autumn Annals record instances of gods descending upon Xin and spirits entering chambers. The way of serving ghosts and spirits was also more devout than in later generations. Although Zuo Qiuming often fabricated stories, these were ultimately not without some basis. However, the witch of Sangtian met her death through her craft, as recorded in the Zuo Zhuan, to warn later generations against being misled by such individuals. Even those with extraordinary skills and abilities, whose words invariably hit the mark, could not protect themselves in this manner; what more can be said of others? A certain old man surnamed Weng in Shantang, Suzhou, suffered from an illness, laughing and cursing erratically, losing consciousness. The Inner Classic states, "Phlegm obstructs the pericardium, its symptoms resembling madness, with delirium and loss of consciousness." This condition involves no spirit possession. Yet, influenced by customary views, it was mistaken for demonic affliction. Instead of seeking a physician, they consulted a shaman. The shaman, of course, would not deny the presence of an affliction. He then wielded his personal cunning, flaunting his eccentricities, and fed the old man a talisman made of tung oil, ultimately leading to his death through the shaman's misguidance. How grave is the extent to which the people of Wu believe in ghosts and spirits, only to have their bodies killed by it!</p>

<h3>Where Are You Going? (4)</h3>
<p>Generally, a life without a plan has no hope of success; this is an irrefutable truth. Professor James of Harvard University once said, "If you ask a mature adult, 'What will you gain? What will you become?' and they reply, 'I don't know,' that person is beyond help." If someone were to ask us, "What kind of work will you be able to obtain?" perhaps we would be momentarily speechless. However, since we have graduated from university, at the very least we dare to say that we can do some things, and do them well, to be a person of some value, and to live a progressive life. However, such accumulation cannot come from vague ideals, indecisive actions, drifting with the crowd, or waiting for someone to open the door to success for us somewhere. "Where are you going?" If we are determined to provide a forceful answer to this question, then we must have our own ideals, and we must train ourselves according to those ideals. If we want to climb higher, to reach the greatest heights, to see a broader horizon, then we must cast off those base impulses, desires for pleasure and selfishness, careless living, and undisciplined behavior. All of these are the wide road leading to destruction. If we do not conform to others, we will inevitably be misunderstood, opposed, and abandoned. However, this does not matter, because noble ideals and base ideals, good and evil, are always incompatible. The gate that leads to eternal life is narrow, and we must strive diligently to walk through it. Human nature often values theory over practice, and is quick to blame others. For example, some curse merchants for being unethical, while their own actions have the potential to undermine finance and lead the entire industrial system to ruin. Others lament the decline of modern morality, while their own actions help to corrupt society. Still others defy God and disregard righteousness, yet vehemently denounce religion. All of you have received a university education and are outstanding citizens of the nation. You should not have such habits. In short, there is only one path for a person to take: the path to eternal life, the God's path to success. The road is narrow and the gate is small, making it difficult to walk. But we must strive to walk it, because without it, we cannot obtain eternal life. In the past, a great master proclaimed to the world, saying, "I am the way." We must walk his path, do his work. Since ancient times, countless people have followed him, gained life, and never failed. Although the road is arduous and difficult, we strive to cope with it. Our life's progress lies within it.

<h3>Easy to Live in Shanghai, Difficult to Live in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Yanzhang</p>
<p>With the endless soaring of prices, living in Shanghai, except for the general wealthy class and those who are "getting rich," it's safe to say that no family can comfortably maintain daily life. Therefore, people are saying, "Let's go back to the countryside?"</p>
<p>Those who advocate moving to the countryside are naturally suffering from urban life, believing that living in the countryside will stabilize their lives. However, can moving to the countryside really stabilize life? Absolutely not! I have a relative from the countryside of Changshu in the occupied area who told me that rural prices are also rising step by step, following Shanghai's trend. Everyone knows that Changshu is a rice-producing area, and Changshu special japonica rice is very famous, but the local special japonica rice price has also risen to forty yuan per stone. In the past, rice straw was very cheap, and one yuan could buy three or four loads, but now it is so expensive that one yuan only buys fifty catties. In the past, the rural fields and mountains were full of weeds, and no one paid attention to them, but now that rice straw is expensive, some people actually cut these weeds, dry them, and use them as fuel. The prices of oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar have risen to be the same as in Shanghai, and eggs also cost seven cents each. Only pork and fish are slightly cheaper than in Shanghai. As for the prices of daily necessities, they are even more expensive. Shanghai Gu Ben soap is worth two corners one or two, while in the countryside, it costs three corners five points.</p>
<p>In short, returning to the occupied area is a last resort. I hope that Shanghai merchants will show some conscience and let everyone endure the final hurdle. That is beneficial to oneself, to others, to the country, and to the family.</p>

<h3>Don't Use Strange and Bizarre Translations</h3>
<p>— Zixin</p>
<p>Please use more familiar translations or attach the original English name under the translation.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, those who care about current events are probably spending more time reading newspapers. However, every time I read carefully, I often get annoyed and have to spend more time consulting maps and books. This is because the translations of foreign place names and personal names are too strange! I myself admit that my knowledge of foreign geography is not very high, and it is right to suffer the hardship of flipping through maps, but sometimes the translators and editors of news agencies also have to bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>Let me just give two examples; (Sedan), which was famous during the last war, has appeared in four or five incarnations in the newspapers these days. Some newspapers translate it as "Sedon," which seems to be the most common translation, and it is also the translation in some reliable historical and geographical books. But one or two sheets are translated into</p>
<p>"Sidan" and "Saichang". The most interesting thing is that the same news on a certain newspaper has two completely different translations, one is "Sai Tang" and the other is "Se Dan". Among the two, "Se Dan" is easier to guess as "Sedan," while "Sai Tang" clearly makes it a strange place name. There is also the "Mos River" (Mons), where the French and German armies fought fiercely a few days ago. Some news agencies translated it as "Muse River". This is like "Blücher" and "Bai Lujer" which are easy to figure out, but just "guessing" is enough to make a careful newspaper reader spend a lot of time, and the sum of these times is such a pointless loss.</p>
<p>Now I don't want to discuss the issue of whether the translation is accurate or not. I know that the translator will not mis-translate, but it is just because there is no unified name that each goes its own way. For the convenience of readers, I hope that translators and editors, if it is an important place name, choose a more familiar translation to use, and do not translate it strangely and bizarrely, so that readers cannot find their way. Or, directly and simply, attach an English place name after the translation.</p>
<h3>"Panic" and "Busy"</h3>
<p>— Chen Xinkui</p>
<p>Recently, the turbulent and uneasy situation in Shanghai society is extremely obvious. As a result, two new phenomena have occurred in Shanghai:</p>
<p>One phenomenon is "panic." In the midst of soaring prices, people with insufficient finances use their limited monthly income for unlimited daily expenses. Since income and expenditure cannot be balanced, it is impossible to establish a budget. Tofu is as expensive as meat, cloth is more expensive than silk, electricity bills are increased again and again, and house rent is increased again and again. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all difficult, and there is no way to "increase income" and no way to "reduce expenditure." What will the future hold? Basically, they have lost control. Under such circumstances, how can people not panic?</p>
<p>The opposite phenomenon is "busy." "Busy" is due to the trouble of money. Many wealthy people are not only busy enjoying themselves, but also busy making money. This "busy making money" has made things bigger. Good legal tender has to be exchanged for foreign exchange. The result of you exchanging and me exchanging is a black market. So they laughed and congratulated themselves, thinking that they were busy this time and would make a fortune. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, gold prices and US dollars plunged down, creating a new two-year low. After their distress, they felt that doing short selling was not as good as storing real goods, so they quickly changed their style and wanted everything they could get, whether it was coal, rice, flour, woolen cloth, even foreign candles, soap, floral dew, and perfume. However, things in the world are often unsatisfactory, and the rules of "being picked off" and "coming out of the cage" are not necessarily effective. When the stack orders cannot be bought, the warehouse cannot be found, the factory does not ship, and there is no way to sell, this group of "busy" people will also be "panicked" in circles.</p>
<p>"Panic" is passive and forced; "busy" is active and completely self-inflicted. The more a few people are "busy," the more people "panic." It is enough to see that "busy" is immoral. Originally, the two phenomena of "panic" and "busy" had already appeared in Shanghai, but their development was not as obvious and sharp as it is today. Under the current circumstances, almost everyone in Shanghai is either "panicked" or "busy" or "panicked and busy"; as for people who are "not panicked or busy," I am afraid they are absolutely gone.

<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 24: The Lake and Mountains Have Their Own Merits; the Gentlemen and Ladies Cheer and Shout Long Live</p>
<p>After lingering there for a while, they returned to the Freedom Village Elementary School. Passing by a village conference room, Village Head Zhu invited them in to take a look, saying, "This is the most important political institution in our village, and it is also our Legislative Yuan. Would you like to go in and have a look?" Everyone went in. Inside, there was a village government office, and there were also two or three clerks in charge. Shao Huihua was the first to notice a pile of lanterns under the corridor and asked, "Is there anything else to celebrate here?" Village Head Zhu said, "No! These are all prepared for the Double Tenth Festival this year to celebrate National Day. Because this year is the fortieth year of the Republic of China, and it is also the fifth anniversary of the establishment of our new village. I want to make it a little more lively. The children in the school were very inspired when they heard this, and these lanterns were all made by themselves in handicrafts class. Since they are happy, we cannot stop them. On that day, they will also have a lantern parade." Zhu Ai’ren asked, "Just a parade in Freedom Village?" Village Head Zhu said, "They have agreed with the Water Bamboo Village Elementary School to exchange parades jointly. They will meet at the Xie Martyr Bridge. Our students will parade in Water Bamboo Village first, and then return to Wood Village. Moreover, Water Bamboo students will also parade in our village, and finally set off fireworks at the Xie Martyr Bridge." Zhu Ai’ren said, "That will be extremely lively on that day." Village Head Zhu said, "Not only that! The male and female staff of their silkworm seed manufacturing plant originally had a drama troupe. On that day, they will also borrow our assembly hall to celebrate National Day and put on a live play. Originally, in autumn and winter, their seed production plant is relatively idle. They use this to entertain themselves after work. This day can be considered a happy day for our Freedom Village. I am old, and I don't know if I will be able to have such a happy anniversary again in the future? On that day, you can come back to Freedom Village, right? Now people are talking about the five-year plan. This village has been established for five years, and I also want to report the completion of my first five-year plan, followed by the second five-year plan." Seeing that her grandfather was very happy, Zhu Ai’ren said, "I'll come! I'll definitely come!" Zhu Ai’ren thought: Our old father is too hard-working in his life. A one-armed man, a one-armed man, although he is over seventy years old, is still working hard for the countryside. I am an orphan, and my father passed away a long time ago. Although my mother is virtuous, unfortunately, she is not a member of the higher educated class. If it weren’t for my grandfather, entrusting me to the old doctor, how could I be where I am today? But since I came back from studying in the United States and worked in the hospital, how could I have a day to enjoy my family?" (283)</p>

<h3>The Five Dionne Quintuplets: Recent Life</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>The Dionne quintuplets of Canada are world-renowned. They live in a specially built and beautiful nursery, raised by the Canadian government, with everything done according to scientific methods, supervised by Dr. Dafoe, with three nurses, one teacher, and a supervisor to train them. This can be regarded as the most scientific method of children's education.</p>
<p>When the nursery was first built, the children were still small, and only a few rooms were enough. Later, as the children grew up, the houses gradually expanded. At present, the nursery is just a two-story building, but it looks very magnificent. Inside, there are entertainment rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, kitchens, punishment rooms, storage rooms, etc. The total value of all the equipment in the house is US$100,000. Those funds were all earned by the five sisters themselves. They also have a large sum of money in the bank.</p>
<p>The five sisters were born on May 28, 1934, and now they are six years old. Therefore, Dr. Dafoe recently asked the Canadian government to expand the nursery, and it is reported that the government has approved it. According to Dr. Dafoe, before the summer of this year, a long fence will be built around the area to surround the house, and several acres of forest area behind the house will be enclosed. In addition to playing in the vast sports field, the five sisters can also walk and relax among the flowers and plants in the natural forest area without getting lost. At that time, this nursery will become a small village, as if it were a paradise.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Ying Yin</h3>
<p>— Ms. Shawi</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, I met Ms. Ying Yin, who will play "Empress Dowager Cixi." After some pleasantries, we had the following conversation:</p>
<p>(Question) May I ask, Miss Ying Yin, how old are you this year?</p>
<p>(Answer) To my shame, I am already thirty years old.</p>
<p>(Question) How did you come to love drama?</p>
<p>(Answer) This can also be said to be my nature, because I have liked acting since I was a child. I used to perform on stage often when I was in school.</p>
<p>(Question) What was the first play you performed in Shanghai? What role did you play? Where was the address?</p>
<p>(Answer) Hua Yueying in "The Devil of Desire," the address was at the "Carlton."</p>
<p>(Question) How did you jump onto the silver screen?</p>
<p>(Answer) Six or seven years ago, Mr. Dan Duyu, the director of Shanghai Film Company, came to find me.</p>
<p>(Question) How many plays have you filmed in Shanghai before the war?</p>
<p>(Answer) The main ones are "Crossroads," "Peach Blossom Dream," and "Little Aunt."</p>
<p>(Question) I heard that "Empress Dowager Cixi" will not start filming until the beginning of July, so what are you doing in Shanghai recently when you are free?</p>
<p>(Answer) No, it won’t start filming until mid-July. Recently, I have been doing nothing but reading.</p>
