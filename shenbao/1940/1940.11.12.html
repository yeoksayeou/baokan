<p>社評</p>
<h3>刮日看蘇聯</h3>
<p>蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛托夫氏突破其寸步不出國門的靜態，宣告正式訪問德京柏林，前日首途，昨已到達；無疑的，這在近頃千變萬化的國際動態中、又一極陰森，極曼妙，而爲舉世視綫所注的序慕。</p>
<p>李維諾夫氏往年嘗屢决歷聘多國，當時猶是人民外交委員長身分，蓋係莫洛托夫氏的前任；故這一次莫氏訪德，祗是莫氏就任後的處女行動，未可遽以象徵爲蘇聯外交的特別作爲。况德國外交部長里賓特洛夫氏於去秋躬赴蘇京，國際通例，禮尙往來，是莫氏自應報聘，亦未可遽以判斷爲兩國外交的異常親昵。這是正常的牛面的觀察。在這觀察之下，却亦見得莫斯科方面，目前並無何種重要的外交談判，難分難解，未決將決，正在積極進行；吾則，莫氏安得於此際抽身遠行？然則，日方所吹聽的，新任駐蘇大使建卅了蘇京，如何如何活躍有效，其事實還是待攷。</p>
<p>在這國際的非常時期，蘇聯外長報聘德京，宜不容等閑視之。去秋德外長赴蘇，簽訂了蘇德互不侵犯協定，釀成了今日的世界；現在雖不必方式的推論爲莫氏此行，殆亦將有與錙銖悉稱的圖謀與成就；然此行性質的不祗爲酢酬而報聘，亦即報聘之外，必然別有使命。是何使命？非局外人所得確知，惟有等待續報，庶幾可以判明風雲怎樣開展。但在目前這一霎那，德國已得相當收穫。蓋雙方交戰，以德國與英國爲對立的主角；而中立國家之堪稱舉足重輕的，以美國與蘇聯相提並論；其間遠近親疎，悲歡離合，近之有關國內的士氣民心，國際的分野向背，遠之有關戰局的前途；方今各方在萬目睽睽之下，對於蘇聯趨蹌拉攏，惟恐落後，而蘇聯外長竟接受了德國方面的邀請而款段以行，是不但在英國無可掩諱於相形見絀，反之，在德國的國內與國際，這眞是何種可資招徭號召的新鮮資料啊！想見柏林昨今歡迎蘇聯外長莫洛托夫氏的盛况，或較希特勒元首從巴黎奏凱歸來，興高彩烈，大吹大擂、當有過之無不及；法國屈服，是戰局的局部勝利，而迎此貴賓則後望無窮，是外交大捷的先聲。</p>
<p>先聲，祇是先聲而已，後事未可必，未可知。世人當然無從確悉莫洛托夫氏使命的內容，更無從想像雙方折衝的結局。假定說：莫氏代表了蘇聯，往柏林支撐德義的所謂創建歐洲新秩序，甚且往柏林接受新秩序領導者的領導。或假定：莫氏赴德，保持了對等資格，自此放棄和平，與德締盟，對英宣戰。或假定：蘇聯準備犧牲土爾其，出賣東南歐的斯拉夫淵源，贊助德義的征服巴爾幹。或假定；蘇聯預先承認了德國的終局勝利，故遣莫氏往柏林簽署分贓的預的券。凡此假定，竟居其一，則德國外交眞是大捷了。但在正常而平凡的智慧中，不能不認此任何一種假定爲祇是假定而已：假定實現，纔是小可想像的奇蹟！</p>
<p>六日之前，蘇聯最高會會議主席加里寗氏曾經嚴肅的表示今後蘇聯在國際，勢難長此保持其不偏不倚的政策，加以昨日的莫洛托夫氏赴德國、若將二者併爲一談而引伸之，可以最簡單的解釋爲蘇聯助德戰英的朕兆。我們現在並無千眞萬確的證言證物，可以反證這一朕兆的決不成立；同時，又以爲二者不容作若此簡單的解釋。因爲加氏演說與莫氏遠行，實二事而一揆；旣可視爲助德戰英的朕兆，又可視爲不再容忍德義恣意昂淮的警告，復可視爲對於英德雙方暗示其待善價而沽，亦未嘗不可視爲有所恃而將試爲排難解紛；總之，二者皆　可進可退，可左可右，盤旋翻騰，各有任意伸縮，任意取捨的極大角度，極大自由；在此各有可能而又各嫌不足的時候，論斷太早，爲憂爲喜亦太早。試爲推論，則蘇聯對於國際漩渦，並非技癢至不能忍耐而躍躍欲試，乃是漸决感覺踧踏小能自安；因此之故，或望疎解全局，或望穩定一隅，或企圖火燄的稍遠自己眉睫而向他方發展。若謂蘇聯小甘寂寞，不辭從井救人，躍入漩渦，鑽進火坑，這是不可想像的大變。莫洛托夫氏決不悄然賦歸，蘇聯決不默爾而息，請刮目以看今後數日內表現的事實！</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（二）　法蘭西的大悲劇</h3>
<p>波爾多方面，對於政府各機關，外交團和新聞界，蜂湧而來，一無準備。城中已有難民一百萬人，絡繹於途的還不計其數街道中車輛阻塞，難民多以之爲臨時棲身之所。</p>
<p>大批議員官吏，和公務人員等，知道末日已近，乃緊隨政府不捨。銀行家，實業家，商人，著作家，和他們的妻室情婦，都準備一遷冉遷。街道上，咖啡店和旅館中，簽發護照的領事館內，以及各部的走廊裏，都是人頭擠擠。民衆相遇，無不互探消息，同時傳　着十九無根的謠言。哈布斯堡皇室承繼人奧都大公，年方少壯，禿着頭，穿着雨衣，顰眉蹙額，在警察局前踱來踱去。波蘭公使哈勒將軍白鬚飄蕩，正和穿着黑外套的比和時首相畢洛娓娓談話。光明飯店門首則擠着倫敦巴黎維也納逃來的猶太財閥洛斯嘉各房男女。</p>
<p>法政府各部長卽在此不可思議的氛圍中，一天要會議幾次，等待萊諾向羅斯幅最後呼籲的結果。他們也還考慮把政府遷移到摩洛哥或阿爾熱利亞，或者遷栘到英國　繼續作戰。總統和總理的臨時官邸在一條街上，相距不過一百碼。二者之間，車水馬龍，達官貴人的汽車往來不絕。內閣會議繼續至四五小時。貝當熱烈要求停戰，擁護他的人日益衆多。道一位古稀宿將，穿着舊日戎裝，語雖斷續，却是善於措辭。他說：「諸位，請想想法國的前途吧。我們不能放棄國家，聽其自然，也不能仟人蹂躪。我們要留在這種神聖土地，照管國人。我們要在戰勝利者一無顧慮拒絕談判的時間未到以前，向之取得保全靑年子弟和城市村鎭的保障。這樣，復興的機會，仍可握在我們的手中」。</p>
<p>福祿沙，鮑多恩，和新任情報部長普維伏（卽巴黎晚報發行人）都站在一條錢上擁護貝當的高見。普多伏說道：「假使我們離此他遷，民　是不會諒解的。他們以爲我們帶着銀箱逃跑了。</p>
<p>貝當又道：我們要趕　，要趕緊。凡爾登，梅茲，色當，埃貝納，貝爾福，特勞，旭蒙，奧爾倫斯，都已陷落了」。</p>
<p>魏剛的總司令部本已遷往維希，現在又須撤退到波爾多附近。魏剛這時也被召與會。</p>
<p>他說：「大局已不可收拾。馬奇諾防綫已被包抄，阿爾卑斯守軍不久也要被圍了。我們祗有極少數的孤軍奮鬥，他們已小能互通消息，也不能與我們接觸。殘餘的飛機，大部份都在地面上炸燬了」。</p>
<p>萊諾仍擬主張繼續作戰。他說：一我們不能放棄艦隊。我們不能失去一切，更不能喪失榮譽。各屬地的資源，尙水匱乏」。他亚與邱吉爾通電話，勸他冉來波爾多，參與末次會議。邱吉爾起初不答應，後來郤提出一種新建議，主張組織英法聯邦，共同統治兩國人民，直到戰事終了爲止。兩國的資源財富領土屬地，都歸　聯邦政府管轄。</p>
<p>芒台爾贊成此項建議。特戈爾將軍更是非常熱烈的贊成。其他閣員則以爲這計劃徒使法國受英支配而已。羅斯福對萊諾呼籲的覆電也祇有空言慰籍，表示願意贊助繼續作戰。此時法國第一綫的驅逐機，祇剩五百架了。</p>
<p>國會正在休會期內，但有好幾白個參議員和衆議員在市政廳帶盤旋往來。其中頗有主張停戰的，祗有白髮蒼蒼的參議院議長雅納南和兀立如山的衆議院議長赫禮歐，反對屈服。</p>
<p>六月十六日午後，貝當必欲內閣決定和戰大計。於是冉度召開會議，由贊成貝當主張的勒勃倫總統主席。勒勃倫請求閣員立卽決定，並主張將決議案由貝當魏剛兩位大將簽字，向國人宣佈。這時大家都知道民　長官的權利已經掃地以盡。人民特別是軍人，祗有憑着貝當魏剛兩大的聲勢接受刧運。最　旭當力謀調和谷派意見，主張先由瑞士政　向希特勒作一試探。於是贊成停戰的一派宜吿勝利。</p>
<p>萊諾因之立刻辭職。當晚卽由貝當組織新政府，以魏剛任國防部長，達朗任海軍部長。舉止嫺雅的鮑多恩，一星期來，依附貝當，這時居然獲得外交部長一席。賴伐爾在上一天，差不多和西班牙駐法大使勒格禮加作了個竟日之談。貝當把他招來，擬與以司法部長一席。賴伐爾謝絕不受。他非外交部長一職不就。他恐怕負簽訂停戰協定惡名，實際上並無加人內閣之意。祖他終於說明了他和西班牙大使長談的內容。貝當正在找尋一個適當的密使，便立刻把　朗哥的代表請米。勒格禮加偕着敎皇使節凡勒利同見貝當，兩人允向德義兩國政權轉達停戰之意。這個提議須作爲軍人和軍人間榮譽的提議。</p>
<p>那天晚上，貝當並未上床安寤。直到黎明，方在一個靠椅中坐下，用毛毯　着兩滕，作數小時的休息。他從前在凡爾登指揮　役時，經過一天困難工作之後，知道明天的困難還要加倍，便這樣的坐着假寐，休養精神。</p>
<p>六月十八日，希特勒和墨索里尼在慕尼克會議，決定對法停戰條件，但是德軍仍在繼續前進。他們一面佔領了勃列登尼的萊尼斯，又渡過了洛亞河下游，一面取得了奈佛斯，直達瑞士邊境。三天之後，又進佔了維希和里昂。波爾多方面接不到柏林或羅馬方面的回音，形勢緊張到小堪忍受的地步。</p>
<p>忽然報稱芒台爾被捕了。他正在波爾多一家最豪華的菜館中和著名女伶白蘭蒂進餐，突然被警察逮捕。芒台爾被捕了！這不楚企圖用武力接收政府嗎？這不是德國方面所提出的第一個要求嗎？其實芒台爾曾被波爾多市民吿發，說他私藏軍火，圖謀顚覆貝當政府，因此被拘三小時後，他却接着貝當的道歉信，恢復自由了。</p>
<p>像這種無稽的謠言，叉傳說萊諾已經離法赴美。實則萊諾正在光明飯店的大廳中蹀蹼往來，態度非常鎭靜，自信力亦未减弱。舊政府中已經離開法國的，祇有一個特戈爾將軍。他是個具有野心的　辟派，在預言此决悲劇之後，卽赴倫敦組織法蘭西民族委員會，反抗貝當政府。</p>
<p>德國的答覆，至十九日方始傳到，請法國，指派全權大使，賦與簽訂停戰條約的權力。德國方面同意之後，當指定與德國全權大使會見的時日和地點」。法國政府當卽提出諾齊格和裴格勒兩位將軍，勒魯克海軍上將和前仟駐波蘭大使諾爾四人。他們當　卽赴貢比臯，就在一九一八年德國將領接受屈伏條件的同一輛火車中，得　了法國的命運。這天晚上波爾多又遭受德　猛烈的轟炸。</p>
<p>關於法國艦隊的處置問題，日間曾有長時間的秘密談話。英國海軍大臣亞立山大偕同英國駐法大使康倍爾爵士乘坐飛機趕到波爾多，同貝當儿首和海軍部長達朗外交部長鮑多恩磋商。彼此商定無論如何，決不把法國艦隊移交德國。達朗並在下一决閣議中懇求切不可把法國艦隊去和英國交戰，並提議由法國自己把各艦解除武裝。閣員全體贊成此議。</p>
<p>六月二十日，法政府覺得要望德國提出可以接受的條件，毫無把握，因此臨時決定把政府遷往貝比南。衆議院辦公處並私下租賃一船，把德國所最痛恨的幾個人載離波爾多。在這船上的，有　拉第和他的兒子琪英，有芒台爾，剛秉基，台爾博期，和十幾個衆議員幾天之　，該船行抵北菲洲卡薩白倫卡。達拉第因不慣風浪，暈船很利害，剛秉基的牙齒被人擊落，他們登岸時，都被當作逋逃者看　。</p>
<p>六月二十二日，貢比臬方面仍無消息，大槪是因條件嚴酷的緣故。閣員中父考慮遷往北非這件事。他們切實決定，假使條件過苛，卽當實行。車輛船隻，都已準備把一班部長和各部的辦事人員，載往阿爾熱利亞。</p>
<p>六月二十三日，洪齊格將軍感謝德軍用極快的時間架設一條電話錢，使他隨時得與貝當通話，報吿德方的條件。（實際波爾多已　六小時前由西班牙外長專使裴貝特上校轉告此項條件，西班牙外長的消息，則係由德國大使史多萊轉達）。此項條件，經法國全權大使在細節上略行修正後，便全部接受。法義停戰協定也在决日簽字。</p>
<p>六月二十五日零時三十五分，戰事正式終止。法國自宣戰至今，不過二白九十七天，實際作戰，不過四十七天，至此使放下兵器，領土被佔領的共有一分之二（完）</p>

<h3>外僑舉行莊嚴儀式　紀念歐洲休戰　呈獻花圈向無名英雄致敬　並祈禱公理終能戰勝強權</h3>
<p>昨日爲第一决世界大戰休戰紀念日、回溯已往、瞻念未來、誠可使人起無窮之感喟、本市英美法僑民、均以嚴肅而沉穆之態度、先後赴外灘和平紀念碑前獻花圈、向已往爲正義與和平而犧牲生命之前一代無名英雄致敬、並祈禱公理之終能戰勝强權、儀式雖簡單降重、實具有偉大之意義焉、茲分記詳情於後、</p>
<p>英法僑民同獻花圈</p>
<p>本市英法兩國僑民、係十分、在和平之神紀念碑前、舉行共同之紀念儀式、法僑獻花圈五具、英僑則獻一巨大之紅色罌粟花圈、英僑立於紀念碑之左、由英總領事喬治爲代表、此外參加者、有萬國商團司令亨培·英總領事署武官·及大英戰勝會、英國退伍軍人聯合會·代表三十餘人、每人胸襟、均佩有鮮豔紅花一朶、列成雙行、法僑立於紀念碑之右、爲身穿軍服之法國人叫十名、其中有法總領事代表參戰退伍軍人代表·及法國總會法公董局等之代表、聞此等法僑、其中半數、據稱係擁護法國特戈爾者、雙方於莊嚴空氣中、靜默祈禱、此時各國僑民數百人、羣赴該處、脫帽肅立致敬、並聞法方於上午九時三十分、復在聖若瑟敎堂、舉行紀念禮拜、</p>
<p>美僑儀式莊嚴隆重</p>
<p>昨日在紀念中令人有最深刻之印象者、爲昨晨十一時美國僑民所舉行之典禮、當時貝克上校·海密爾頓少校·美海軍第四聯隊兩分隊·及本埠美僑各團體代表等、在和平之神紀念碑前、曾作二十分鐘之紀念儀式、當美軍撐旗隊高擎　國旗一面、進入方塲中、向國旗行敬禮時、路旁駐足而觀之美僑及他國人士、爲數甚多、於是具克上校及　密爾頓少校、在神像　、獻一巨大之菊花花圈、繼之者爲美國汽車業鉅子馬迪、代表美軍聯隊、艾利夫人及龐特夫人代表美國婦女總會、及鄧萊普夫人與湯林生夫人、代表美國革命女兒會、先後向神像前敬獻花圈、然後由第四聯隊牧師屈倫浦、作五分鐘之演講與祈禱、屈牧師在演講中有言曰、「吾人必須許身於公理與正義、使此輩墓下之偉人、雖死猶生、此動人之典禮最後　幕爲美海軍第四聯隊喇叭隊吹奏美國旗萬歲」一曲、</p>
<p>圍觀民衆　達數千人</p>
<p>當美軍舉行紀念儀式時、附近民衆圍觀者達數千人、兩租界警務當局爲維持秩序起見、特派大批巡捕、在塲照料、並在銅像對面馬路人行道及銅像四週、攔置鐵網木柵、以阻觀衆行近、但因各國衆多僑民及美軍參加儀式、致該處馬路被阻斷、交通暫時斷絕五分鐘、儀式行過後、各國僑民所送花圈仍留置銅像前、以供參觀、終日往觀者絡繹不絕、公共租界捕房則派有巡捕多名、在旁守護、</p>
<h3>靜安寺路西端　仍架鐵鋼</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、十月十八日日憲兵隊伍長齋籘精一、在愚園路被刺後、日當局卽在西區採取戒備、致英商公共汽車之雙車軍均駛至靜安寺爲止、僅單層車過靜安寺西行、歷三週有餘、直至昨日（十日）雙層車始恢復行駛靜安寺以西之區與海格路、同時、工部局警務處因西區罪行迭起、而在通往海格路與靜安寺以外區域及通入大西路、靜安寺路與愚園路各馬路口架置有刺鐵絲網障碍物、昨日仍未拆除、</p>

<h3>法租界訴訟停頓　法官幾全引退　律師公會已遷移他處　薛華立路上頓呈冷落</h3>
<p>法租界所有依據中法簽訂協定法租界內設置之中國法院，自本月八日被攫佔後、法院方面以法租界當局、不顧協定、任令非法侵人、逼不得已、相率退出、此後正式之中國法院、暫停行使職務、根據國府命令、嗣後法租界內凡有自稱法院之判决、一律作爲無效、平明社記者、昨向各方探得消息、彙誌如决、</p>
<p>律師公會　遷地辦公</p>
<p>據聞江蘇高等法院第三分院被攫取時院內尙有十七萬餘之當事人保證金等、未及携出、而入若輩之手、至第二特區地方法院、事前早有人暗中窺視、卽一報紙之微、亦不得仟意携出、至於律師公會早於事前遷出界外、多人討論結果、以爲律師均應遵守法令、法租界合法法院、旣然暫停行使職務、當然停止出庭、因此昨日薛華立路上車輛稀少</p>
<p>執行處職　員均引退</p>
<p>上海第二特區地方法院民事强制執行案件、專設民事執行處有職員十餘人、聞自該院被攫取之日起、該處推事舒昶·陸家瑞·書記官馬素泉·徐律佳·王篤英·等、一律引退、現在該「院一民事執行案件、均在停頓中、</p>
<p>案件停頓　難以恢復</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法租界高三分院及第二特院之推檢、什九皆已拒絕釗「院辦公、其他律師與法租界捕房律師、亦拒不出庭、以致自上星期五（八日）以來、尙未審决各索、均吿無形停頓、一時甚難恢復原狀、但悉新「委之若干職員、或將於今後一二日內、走馬上「任」、同時法捕房方面、今晨（卽昨晨）繼續在法院房屋前、嚴重戒備、以免發生意外事件、官方對於法院問題、拒絕發表意見、但悉今日或將賡續談話、以謀解決目下之困難、</p>

<p>來滬涂中平安無事</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國第二艘撤僑瑪里波薩號今日（十一日）上午十一時卅分駛抵上海、立即準備於明日（十二日）侵晨、起椗　往華北與朝鮮、瑪里波薩號載重一萬九千　、設備華麗、輪身髹白色、閃閃有光、抵滬後泊第十一與十二號浮筒、尙有美國總統輪船公司人員一批登輪照料、該輪兩側與輪尾、各繪巨大美旗一、聞此旗係歐戰爆發起卽繪、非因駛來遠東而添繪者、據輪長梅耶吿記者、該輪從檀香山駛來、一路平安無事、僅在小笠原島以東、遇惡劣天氣、的歷三天、但此非異常事、因船過該島之東、輙遇不佳之天氣也、</p>
<p>神戶港口　決不灣泊</p>
<p>瑪里波薩號抵此、未載一客、來滬途中、船員有電影室與游泳池等消遣、全輪可容客七百二十五人、且已略添吊床若干、以防搭客逾額、在檀香山時、已添辦供應物品、準備應付「任伺發展」云、惟據美國總統輪船公司方面聲稱、瑪里波薩號搭客、不致過分擁擠、搭該輪啟程之美僑、上海方面現有八十五人、秦皇島與朝鮮仁川方面、不足五百人、叉據宣布、瑪里波薩號、決不灣泊日本神戶、但該輪離仁川後、將向何地駛去、則未經披露、當瑪里波薩號寄椗後、船員紛紛登岸觀光、輪長梅耶亦然、據稱、渠已十八年未抵上海、面目必已大變、瑪里波薩號曾於八九年前、一度沿中國海岸航行、但來上海、尙屬首决云、</p>

<h3>香港設立　移民局　旅客恐受限制　爭先搭輪前往</h3>
<p>近傳香港政府因鑒於當地人口過密、欲求限制旅客前往、決將於下月一日起、設置移民局、辦理移民入境手續、執行限制旅客赴港、平明社記者頃向旅行社方面詢悉、本埠旅客之欲往香港者、因恐港政府公佈是項限制條例後、手續上勢必較爲繁鎖、故頗多提前赴港，因此近來旅客購買赴港客票者甚衆、港政府現已通吿本埠旅行界、凡由滬前往香港者、不論等級皆須持有離扈前六日之工部局牛痘證及防疫證書、目以貼有本人二寸半身照片者方爲有效、吾則不准上岸、父聞英商怡和輪船公司之赴港輪隻、明生輪定明日、裕生輪定本月十六日開往香港、旅客方面、亦將較前踴躍、</p>
<h3>運西南商貨　經沙魚涌</h3>

<h3>本埠觀察家談　蘇聯維護中立　決不致與英美陣綫爲敵　蘇外長聘德影響各小國</h3>
<p>關於蘇聯外長　洛托夫赴德報聘事、據本埠某觀察家談稱、蘇聯在巴爾幹及近東、保有傳統利益、而黑海及達達尼爾、又爲蘇俄南門之鎖鑰、西歐烽火、逐漸東移、已使蘇聯感覺不安、莫洛托夫躬赴柏林、目的卽在與德討論劃分東歐之勢力範圍、以折衝手段、保陣蘇聯之利益、此行與近東諸國、尤其土耳其之將來地位、有重大關係、蘇聯一時不致放棄其和平中立政策、更不致加入軸心國共同行動、對付英美陣綫，惟如果蘇德談判協調、勢將影響於東歐小國之態度、則英國獨力在巴爾幹方面應付德義確爲艱難之工作、</p>
<h3>米價受謠言支配　昨日漲風激烈　當局無法遏制提早收市　負責方面不宜視若無覩</h3>
<p>連日米市、因投資分子活躍、致每石價格有遞升、昨又繼漲二元上下、四日來之米價、每石竟高漲達六元之距、市塲管委會無法遏制、卒於十一時提早停市、若不急予設法抑止勢將事演上月間漫無限制之漲風、</p>
<p>罪行昭著</p>
<p>本市自國米來源稍受限制後、卽向外洋產地訂購洋米，致本市售價之漲落、須視洋米來源之多寡而定、自越南局勢變動後、投機份子卽籍口種種原因、將米價抬高、但洋米來源、非特迄未受阻、目甚湧旺、兩週來之到貨、已在四十萬包以上、存底亦甚充實、一部份販運商人、因乘金價下跌、滙市放長之機會、紛紛向產區訂購、爲數亦在數十萬包之間、更於上海市民食調節協會推動集團購訂後、各界均紛紛饗應參加、故本市民食前途、殊爲樂觀、本無匱乏竭蹶之虞、今因投機商操縱作祟、囤戶父掯不放手、藉詞抬價使稍爲穩定之米市、又呈緊張狀態、此棟掀風作浪之罪仃、租界當局應即設法强行壓制、實不宜視若無覩也、</p>
<p>乘機造謠</p>
<p>近因投機份子在市塲內揚言、謂日軍南進政策一日成功、則嗣後　購　米、將發生困難一部份仃號紛紛大量吸進、致墮人投機份子之術中、予以居奇抬價之機會、使整個米市陷於混亂、日軍雖有南進之企圖、但目前決無妨碍洋米運滬之處、因南洋一帶所產每年三熟、此巨額之產量、若不向國外市塲推銷、則對於本國之整個經濟、勢必大受影響、而現下滬越航運暢通、洋米運輸、亦較前簡便、故價格之連續上漲、絕無理由、聞米糧評價會、深恐逾越當局所規定之應得百分之五之利潤、而混亂米市、故連日交換意見、擬卽召集會議、商討抑止辦法、當局對此亦頗注視、遇必要時、將會同米業團體　行抑平米價</p>
<p>集購宜速</p>
<p>關於市民之自動發起集團訂購洋米、迭經有　方面一再倡導、記者亦數度申述市民之自動購米、攸關滬市整個民食之前途、雖多方面已經發動照辦、然大部份仍猶觀望不前、坐失良機、今則米價又頻頻喊高、升斗小民生計、不無遭受嚴重打擊、惟米商之藉口、終以米棧存底不豐、及國內外來源不湧、故人心堅挺、米價復起高峯、茲有關方面渴盼各界從速發起或參加集團訂購洋米、勿再坐失良機、共謀穩定滬市整個民食、以解平民倒懸之厄、寗波旅滬同鄕會、首屆集團購米、每包價格暫定七十五元、已着手進行矣、</p>

<h3>中央銀行舊址　係工部局承租雖已退租尚未交還業主　自被佔據後中行無表示</h3>
<p>九江路外灘轉角之中央銀行舊址、戰後因中央銀行總行移入內地、上海分行遷至逸園辦公、該舊址由工部局承租開設學校、並訂有承租契的、今工部局聶中丞學校等、已遷至大西路上課、對中央銀行舊址、雖依照租的於三個月前聲明退租、在該舊址未交還業主之際、竟爲「佔據」、聞中央銀行以該舊址由工部局承租、尙未交還業主、今雖被佔據、並無表示、</p>

<h3>米蠧不去食難未已　囤戶是有財勢……呼籲是天聾低啞　洋米是節節有到……米價是天天上騰　一日間連漲數元……貧民將盡趨溝壑</h3>
<p>連日米價上漲、眞是出乎尋常，存底不減到貨日有，而米價儘是不顧一切向上抬，種種謠　，已一再證明不攻自破的用事實來打消，可是事實儘管是事實，謠言仍舊放謠言，囤戶操縱，依然發揮其最大力量，皆只爲別種商品，非是「飯貨」，卽如布疋，雖說是「飯貨」，究竟不如十足道地的「飯貨一米糧之好，因爲一件衣裳可穿幾年，破了可補，故布疋雖貴到戰前絲綢價錢還不止，然而終不如一日不食則飢，七日不食則死的米糧，竟可說「一日不可無此君」的操縱在手內，來得千穩萬妥，而且一經到了肚裏，飢火燃燒，不到數小時，又是飢腸轤轆，就要增加新燃料的粥飯，所以最近游資充斥，不用於正當工商業上，而用於大衆生存的米糧上，眞正就借刀殺人，不怕血腥氣，只圖自己的享用，不顧大家的苦痛，現在看看一般米商，莫不趾高氣揚，肥頭大腦，雪茄燒燒，老酒喝喝，　家歡喜，可是有不少不少正爲此而愁眉叫苦，食不飽，湯來喝，還是無辦法，米市塲鬧到如此地步，固然原則不一，其實一半的原因，正因投機囤戶欲求之而不可得，如所謂「統治」「戰時」「饑荒」，使其他之人聞之心傷，獨米商囤戶爲之色喜，因為沒有這種情形，囤戶操縱，就不能造謠生事，卽無從渾水摸魚，何況這樣的米價，非有財有勢的不能做，一談到平準，又是天聾地啞一般呼籲無靈，黑心的米商還在高喊蝕本，此所謂蝕本也者，必以米價曾一度見過八十餘元之價格，以爲非再到　　步不可，而不知昨日西貢一號已至七十一元，新粳原包已有九十一元之高價，如此說來，照米商心理，以後米價非逐日高漲不可，吾則叉將以爲蝕本，試問有是理乎，總之，米蠹不去，民食艱難未已也。</p>
<p>囤戶之作用、如是其狠辣、但觀洋米、依然到源無虛日、太古公司綏陽輪、自香港裝來五千四百五十六包、上星期六傍晚到埠、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、昨日怡和洋行有兩輪到滬、由香港運來洋米、計明生輪裝來三千二百八十五包、日　輸祇裝來二百包、惟今日原船運往靑島、洋米有叫千三白零四包、（祗）</p>
<p>洋米昨市飛騰、高决各檔一致拾級上升、一號西（　午至七十二元、午後尙圖扳俏而不肯售出、市上謠言蜂起、人心惶惑、而囤買大戶盡以游資吸收米糧、以致市價越抬高、現貨一號英華司已開到八十元、十二月份一號至七十八元半、二號七十六元至七十五元半、且不肯盡量售出、甚至借外灘某房屋被占、又向法幣造謠言所惑、再逢滙縮金漲、定價划高、不啻火上加油、爲囤戶揚眉叶氣、因此早市開價後節節上升、現洋米上午已大元半全二元、午後再大近元、二號西　下午已開至六十八元七角、比之週六則較大近三元之鉅、　日交易因被囤戶暢辦成交有　七千多包、</p>
<p>新粳尖及茶種野稻等到貨仍屬不旺、共祇一二千包、零躉銷塲仍殊栗落、所以貨主扳俏、各價續漲一二元、計新粳原包開九十一元八十九兀、斛見八十六元八十四元、菉種八十二元八十元、野稻中關八十六元五角、杜尖原包七十九兀、斛見七十六元五角、七十五元、羊尖乏貨、</p>
<p>糯米國洋兩貨存底旣較他貨爲薄、而忽有大戶吸收與夫酒戶。及飯擔實銷活絡、以致頓成奇貨、價格猛升二元有奇、宜溧白元八十元、香港普通白元七十六元、决七十三元、糯荼六十五元伴决至六十二元、</p>

<h3>粉麵囤購復殷</h3>
<p>現粉市况、漸有起色、查二號粉廠盤、仍爲十七元、客盤十八元五角、除本街零批交易近萬包外、客銷依然不旺、惟本街囤戶鑒於金貴米漲聲中、投機心思復殷、是以回籠貨老車粉價須十九元二角、由本街收進三百包、因籌碼缺乏、巳難多購、又聞洋粉喊價亦昂但以定粉於上星期六已有六百包裝太古公司綏陽輪、自香港運滬、故本客均鮮垂靑、市面尙在堅擯中、</p>
<p>小麥交易、亦吿擯局、蓋自各地到源稀少以來、除直接解廠貨外、絕無正式售開、聞市塲租界貨價須二十七元、內地帮略有採辦、爲數不巨、而日廠方面仍以原盤收進二百餘包、市面一時進退兩難云、</p>

<h3>油價猛提二元外</h3>

<p>晨初以外滙吿緊、開盤人心紊亂、在抬至五千六百九十元、比上週六收已漲一百二十餘元、時金號多頭乘機獲利了結、價乃回落數十元、計銀號對做二十兩、爲五千六百五上五元、嗣以外滙續軟、賣戶裹足、不久銀號入錢兌業三十兩、出七百元關外、見五千七百十元、但金號等間售、復撳進五千七百元關內、然滙市緊風酷俏、價易升難降、金銀號對做二十兩、突父晉至五千七百四十五元、雖金號出籠下漲勢受挫、而期時散戶及其他新多均來猛撈、竟跳達五千八百元高峯、計金號出銀號二十兩是也、迨至午刻、外滙略已回鬆、銀兌業吐塞、金號仍賣、午收吿五千七百四十元、午後金號入銀號十兩、爲五千七百六十元、又進銀號二十兩、爲五千七百七十五元、而銀號出金號二十兩、稍跌爲五千七百五十五元、一度盤旋、後因滙市續緊、金號等反撈、又高達五千七百九十五元、卒以錢兌業放空、銀號多頭吐出、降至五千七百七十兀、但晚收錢兌業又搜、結果吿五千七百七十元、比上星期六收軋升二百零一元、全日有一百四十五元上落、現金號之本牌金、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦連升二檔</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出、上午九點半掛大十元、十一時三十分又升十元、後勿動、結果大同行懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣無一不升</h3>
<p>昨各國貨幣市况、因關於新「中央銀行」卽將成立之謠仍熾、烚赤市價大漲、英美金鎊因亦一致漲起三元、英金票仍鮮進出、市價呆定如故、美金票始曾步漲至十六元九角、卒爲十六元八角半、比上日軋升七角、香港票隨　滬　兌劇漲二角六分、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均趨堅漲、日金票需要忽殷、晚市高至一元五角四分、朝鮮票略趨挺勢、晚市爲一元一角八分半、</p>
<h3>貼現軋升半元</h3>
<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、先步高而後稍回、上午貼出卽升至六元半、貼進五元半、下午回小至五元、貼出六元、比上週六升半元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛六分、未有更動、</p>
<p>紗花</p>
<h3>投機踴躍購進　紗市劇漲　雙馬跳卅元</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風殊劇、此因市上謠諑朋興、皆囑利多、同時外滙縮風復熾、黃金昂騰、致人心愈爲興奮、買風在烈、市盤乃逐步前進、但實際交易、未會起色、漲力壓制一步、然業外者心思一致看昂、今日（十二）爲總理誕辰、棉紗市塲停市一天、昨有紗二百八十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因報載國際消息利多、人心良好、買戶紛至沓來、二十支雙馬首盤作爲一千二百六十五元、漲十餘元、旋聞外滙開出步步改縮、投機買者愈見踴躍、直漲至一千二百八十二元、繼後某銀行大量吐出、叉復跌至一千二百七十一元、但外滙依然軟弱、而心思看好者占夥、再升至一千二百八十五元、收盤回小幾元、爲一千二百八十元、查牛日間成交統計六千四百四十包、行情漲三十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行六、二五〇　香港一九〇統計六、四四〇</p>
<h3>棉市亦佳</h3>
<p>現棉情形亦屬良好、因外匯縮風劇烈、人心堅挺、所以市面趨高矣、不過廠方需要求曾十分活躍、各路來源、依然艱難、米特林二百八十六元至三百〇五元、皮拉花二百十七元、常陰沙一百四十元云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初卽因投機者之購買、後再因華爾街股票價格之良好、及海外棉商之購買、結果盤價較之上日又漲六七磅音、印度市况平平、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日因滙兌之猛縮、拆合棉價猛漲十餘元不等、市七現貨價格、因之漲起甚鉅、同業心思殊高、竟有不願出樣者、廠方則暫時仍抱觀望態度、故昨日未聞有大量交易之做開也、</p>
<p>疋頭</p>
<h3>紗綫飛漲　布價狂騰</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市開盤、卽吿猛漲、乃緣紗錢飛漲、囤戶吸胃突濃之故、售盤粗布漲一角半至五角、細布細斜漲五角至七角半、漂染布漲五角左右、府綢嗶　細紗綫貨及坯布漲達七角半至主元半、本街成交各貨一千餘件、浙路溫甬紹幫辦細布色布等三百數十件粵港幫辦粗布色布色斜一百餘件、北路烟臺幫辦粗布絨布等一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　本街業內外購囤旺盛、漲勢甚劇、十二磅龍頭細布每疋在跳一元三四角、晨開三十六元起、步升至三十七　一角、後市收盤略回至三十六元九角、四君子嗶嘰每碼自一元一角起至一元〇四分　收　、亦驟漲五分外、蓋以各方利多空氣濃厚、市勢甚挺、</p>
<p>出口　棉布、十一日有三百十五件、運香港、十二日有三十五件、亦運香港、</p>
<h3>素駝絨新出路</h3>
<p>用製羅宋帽及童裝大衣國產寬緊駱駝絨、近來受交通不便、運輸乏路、市銷一落千丈、然爲漲價高昂、購　力减弱亦其一因也、條子出路更呆、素色及美術較好、蓋美術與素色駱駝絨、新近叉有一種新出路、做羅宋帽及孩童大衣、出路隨之見廣、然祇限於下檔、每瑪沽價在二元餘以至五兀餘者爲合格、蓋童裝女大衣每打大半祗批售一百三十元、羅宋帽大半每打祇批沽十一二元耳、</p>
<p>證券</p>
<h3>浮多出籠　內債驟跌</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、驟起跌風、初以中央銀行舊址被佔關係、繼以余子在漲一二百元、市塲人心頓起恐慌、浮多紛紛出籠、開盤　跌一元許、空方大肆活動、竭力壓迫、甲種打破七十元大關、丁種打破六十元關、形勢至爲惡劣、但謠言雖衆、均不切實際、况　頭放出甚多、將來勢必仍有軋空之日、且銀錢業普遍减息後、顯係對於存款不願吸收之明白表示、各方游資仍需覓相當之歸宿、姑觀其後可也、昨日上午恒康。恒孚。聯和。頗有賣出、當時裕興。昌記。則買頗湧、同順協康稍有補進、惟仁昌。樂茂。仍有賣出、市價乃吿不支、各散戶放出亦甚可觀、甲種破進七十元、丁種因上週六未有做開、昨日市價乃除中籤權利、故劇跌三元、餘亦小一元二三角、半日成交的而百萬元、下午停市、今日爲總理誕辰、休業一天、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中一信託公司五十股、價為十三元一角、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>糖價頻漲不已</h3>
<p>昨糖市因外滙猛縮、趨勢縮升二元外、二四粗白現貨、本棧七十五元、外棧由七十三元六大至七十四元五角、計升二元五角、太古車　B嘜西棧七十五元至五元五角、東棧七十四兀三角至七十五元、計升一元三五角DY嘜西棧七十元、東棧六十九元六角、升二允二角、HX嘜西棧七十元、東棧六十九元三角至六角、H嘜棧車亦東棧五十五元、荷綿白BS嘜七十元五角、升一元五角、RA嘜計七十五元、荷赤五十七兀七角至八角、升一元七角、十一月六日打單者五十八元、本廠一號冰九十五元五角、升二兀五角、晶明冰九十七元、升三元、又開出冬霧靑數百包、價爲六十元、</p>
<p>煤炭</p>
<h3>大連運來焦炭　五百餘噸</h3>
<p>日來焦炭市銷轉淡、而車輪來源依然不絕、昨由大連運來焦炭統貨五百餘噸、各路續有售開、然以進戶納胃懈怠、市面繼續趨跌、計做同業行拆、統塊每噸一百四十五兀、篩塊一六十元、洋棧車貨、行槓外加</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>紅茶德銷又活　絲繭路續來滬</h3>
<p>絲經　昨日由溫州運來十一件、又由香港來二十件、又蠶繭三百二十四包、亦由溫州載運到港、</p>
<p>茶葉本埠茶市、近週來殊形寥落、惟昨市土莊紅茶、德銷又見活潑、全日共由興成孖士門等行購進五百餘箱價開二百叫十元至　百九十元、行情堅定如故、至綠茶市况、仍趨沉寂、不着色之鳳眉珠茶、國外來常、對於品質優良者、頗有需要、但高莊貨、因來源被阻、極少應市、有色之珍眉珠茶去路亦在停滯中、又查茶葉、昨（十一日）由溫州運來二百八十五件、今（十二日）有一百件、運往香港、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>會司鐵市面寂寞</h3>
<p>會司鐵近日交易略滯、蓋津幫去路時斷時續、烟臺及靑烏等幫客商亦無多大買賣、且本街諸廠家實銷亦薄、僅製罐廠香燜廠等稍有採辦、此外則無動靜、故市况殊感寂寞、人心亦呈懈態、因此標準一節較前微鬆、的五元光景刻老鋼廠每箱二百磅沽一百七十元、新鋼廠二百磅每箱售一百六十五元、查昨日交易的而百餘箱左右、</p>

<p>人們有時漫不經心的說：「我喜歡怎樣，便可怎樣想」。但這話是不確的。我們旣不能要做甚麼就做甚麼，也就不能要想甚麼就想甚麼。如果我對人有惡意，自　會用不公正的手段對待他。思想是言行的策源。我想甚麼，我就會雲說去行。所以耶穌說：「從心裏所發出來的，有惡念，兇殺，姦淫，荀含，盜竊，妄證，謗　等等」。（馬太十五19）人必是先思想到這些事，然後才會實行出來。</p>
<p>我們若以聖潔的意念，尊奉耶穌爲我心之主，那就是聖保羅所說的：「將人所有的心意奪回，使第一個思想，都願服基督」。（林後十5）我們聽候耶穌控制我們的心意，凡是使他的聖担憂的思想，我都一概拒絕，凡祂所不願我們思想的事，我都一概不想</p>
<p>良心的思想也可以培養的，因爲人的思想是本人的意志力所能控制的。我們應當學會控制思想的秘訣。更好的便　是讓基督在你的內意識裏，控制你的思想。如果祂做了我們心意的主，上帝的平安，必在基督坦克保守我們的心懷意念（腓產比四7）。這樣，我們便能在誠實，公正，純潔和可愛的好事上思想。也惟有尊耶穌爲心意之主的人，才會知道思想是生命的最大愉快，因爲耶穌藉著信住　在他的心中，他就會把心意注重上面的事，在一切高尙，美麗的事上，歡欣鼓舞。（十五日再登）</p>

<p>自由辯論婦女往那裏去？（三）</p>
<h3>婦女回家庭去</h3>
<p>— 祺齋</p>
<p>（四）婦女與國家；婦女旣是「社會之母」，當然也是「國家之母」。我們都知道極少數的優良人民就能統治一個有大量人民的低落民族，那就可以看到要使國家有健全的國民，以免淪爲亡國或殖民地，應該怎樣注　婦女的　理環境。現在中國是在奮鬥中，果然需要四萬五千萬人的全部力量，但　叫政治家去製迭軍器，醫學家去掘濠溝或工程師去辦敎育，那末雖然動了全部人民，但得到的力量是零。我們一定要讓各種人各發揮他們的特長，方能收到最大的力量。婦女當然也不能例外，應該發揮她的特長來造就健全國民，纔是各得其所。蔣委員長勸孤島靑年努力學業，不要到內地去，豈是嫌人力太多或不要奮鬥了，他不過有超越的見識，他知道現在的人力和將來的人力是同等重要而已。假使吾們祇顧目前，用盡了現在全部力量而並沒新力量產生出來，到那時後繼無人，祇好仟人家來宰割了。所以婦女造就建全國民以供長期奮鬥或將來復興之用，也是現在國民的重要工作。</p>
<p>（五）婦女與事業：所謂事業，就是一種有利於社會國家或世界的工作。若一種工作能發揮工作者本能的，一定能得到確實效果而使社會國家有利。其决呢，是一種能適應生理上限制和心理上應響的工作。婦女有「母愛特能」，並且，據桑代克（Thorndike）之測騐，同情力，忍耐力與注意人的本能都超過男了，所以非常適宜於敎育子女。叟陶納（V．Sirtaunas說：「一個好母親，勝過一百個敎師，」在偉人傳裏也能見到偉人之所以成爲偉人，大都受到母親的影響，這都是婦女特能造成的。因此婦女而從事敎養子女一定能得到最高效果，最大的成就的。能造就幾個偉人來造福社會國家與世界，眞可算是一件最有利的工作，最偉大的事業啊。其决凡是不受日期，時間和地點的支配，致影響婦女本能工作的有利於社會國家的工作，，也可作爲婦女第二種事業。</p>
<h3>婦女上社會去</h3>
<p>— 亦蕙</p>
<p>（四）婦女與國家：婦女是國民的一分子，她對於國家的興亡，是與男子一樣負有責任的。因此，婦女對於國家的貢獻，專門藉着她的生理上的功能—生產小國民—是不够的。她需要積極地參加到一切造成强大的新中國的工作裏去。在爭取中華民族的獨立和自由上，婦女的努力是和男子的努力同等重要的。「少數優良人民就能統治一個有大量人民的低落民族」的理論是値得我們討論的。少教帝國主義者對於多數弱小民族，的確是處在優越的壓迫和剝削的地位。但是，造成這種優越的局向的，究竟是他們本質的優秀呢，還是他們的金融勢力和軍事力量的雄厚？假如說，婦女應該在家裏養育健全的國民，以使國家不致淪爲殖民地，那末，難道中國的所以淪爲半殖民地，是要歸罪於婦女沒有把孩子敎養成健全的國民嗎？可是，過者幾千年的中國婦女是會經忠心地在家裏盡她的養育兒女的責任的！</p>
<p>（五）婦女與事業：個人對於事業的選擇，應該以他的興趣和特長的標準。男子是這樣，婦女也是這樣。有一些婦女對於兒童有特殊的興趣，他們善於誘導兒童。這類的人才，不但是應做自己的孩子的保姆和敎師，也應該做幾十或幾百個孩子的保姆和敎師，她不但是要敎育自己的孩子成爲偉人，也應該敎育訐多別人的孩子成爲偉人。一個好母親，固然可以勝過一百個敎師。一個好敎師也能够替代一百個或幾百個能養而不能敎的母親。因爲這些以保育兒童爲自己的事業的婦女，可以從他們的工作上，不斷地研究和實騐以獲得保育兒童的最優良方法。這樣，其他的許多婦女，因爲有育兒專家替他們敎養孩子，也就可以各從所好，從事於種種有利於社會的事業。同情，忍耐和對人注意等優良特性，旣是婦女之所長，那婦女也就更應該多負起領導社會的責任。假如一個國家的領袖都是富有同情心和忍耐性的，那末，人民的幸福必定能够大大地增進。爲什麼我們不利用婦女之所長，去爲人類造史大的幸福？（下决續完）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙柏雄的供詞</p>
<p>霍桑淡淡地說道：「可是他到底給你賣掉了啊。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄微笑着說：「是的，但這也不能怪他。我因着他留在店外不像樣子，故而把我全身的衣裳換給乃魁。他的身材跟我相仿，裝束又完全一樣，自然不容易分辨。你的那位探夥才跟着他走開去我才能目由自在地到這裏來拜訪你」</p>
<p>我好像進了夢境，眞有些弄不明白。趙伯雄明明是個要犯，怎麼竟敢自己上門，還裝着這種虛僞的禮貌？更奇怪的，霍桑怎麼也以禮相待？他好久要找尋這個人，現在爲什麼不馬上將他拘捕？我可能打一個電話給倪金壽嗎？</p>
<p>霍桑又冷冷地說：「趙先生，我得提醒你一聲。你如果再細心一些便不會說你此刻是個自由自在的人了。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄的身子略略從椅子上　起了些。「霍先生，這話有什麼意思？你可是又打算要把我——」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖手，說：「不是這個。你一路到這裏來，也不見得怎樣自由自在啊。」</p>
<p>「什麼？又有人監親着我的嗎？」</p>
<p>「對，我相信至少有一個人陪送你到這裏來。你可要見見他？……施桂，你到門外去——」</p>
<p>趙伯雄忙搖着兩手，說：「霍先生，不必，不必。我眞佩服你，你眞是一個偵探的天才。我想像你這樣的才幹，應得爲國家民族担任更重大些的任務。」</p>
<p>霍桑沉着臉兒答道：「我想你此刻來見我，不單是爲着要向我說幾句恭維話罷？」</p>
<p>趙伯雄道：「那當然不是。不過你須明白，我這幾句話實在是由衷而發的，並不是虛僞的敷衍。我到這裏來的目的，有兩個：第一，是道歉；第二，是解釋誤會。」（一六三）</p>
<h3>貪</h3>
<p>— 白狗</p>
<p>貪慾徒然地把資金積聚起來，而在各方面把效用减少了。——泰勒</p>
<p>一個人可裝滿一箱子的恩惠，像裝滿一心腔的金子般地容易。—史賓叟</p>
<p>在貪慾者的眼光中，世界也太小了。—拉丁諺</p>
<p>貪慾者的箱篋是富裕的，但他們自身並不富裕。—英諺</p>
<p>我們爲什麼這般盲目的？我們所積聚，所擁有，和所圃積的，何嘗是爲了我們自己—台魯齊夫人</p>
<p>食慾者的生活，好像世界是爲他而造的，而不是他爲世界而生的。他只知拿進來，不肯拿出去。貪慾者所給予他鄰居的唯一方便，就是讓他們知道，他是像他們一般地對於他所有的　西還不滿足。—威廉辟脫</p>
<h3>巨人的誕辰</h3>
<p>— 衛民</p>
<p>—紀念中山先生誕辰—</p>
<p>七十五年前的今天，在地球的東端—在我們祖國的大地上，誕生了一個孩子。而跟着道孩子降臨的，是中華民國；是推翻滿淸的統治，建立起民主的共和國。可是，這孩子爲拯救民族國家的危亡，做了一生的牛馬，而到今天，這民族的救星是已經閉上了十五年的眼睛，但這民主共和國却還沒有建立完成。不過，我們最近三年多來用血寫下的歷史，這，最光榮的一頁民族革命史，它將獻給我們這位民族的巨人，民族的救星中山先生！—它將保證把我們的救星所遺留下來的艱鉅任務的完成！</p>

<h3>新豔秋雅擅畫蘭</h3>
<p>— 往觀</p>
<p>伶人癖嗜，輙喜附庸風雅，習於薰染，工書晝者遂若不乏其人，時伶墨妙有膾炙人口者，如時慧寳之魏碑，程硯秋之張猛龍碑，縱橫雄偉，彷彿六朝，卽工書者亦且自喟不如，間以藝術餘緖作畫者，如梅蘭芳，王瑤卿，姜妙香，尙小雲，梁秀娟，李世芳之翎毛花卉，王福山之蝴蝶，李萬春之佛象，亦無不楚楚有致，號爲難能可貴。至若秉性恬淡，不以繪事聞於世而其揮洒可以傳世者，則新艷秋之晝蘭，有足稱述焉。</p>
<p>新艷秋工畫蘭，露根無土，全仿所南，籠墨和烟，不遜湘蘭，曩歲曾見某君作王玉華書蘭曲云「書蘭女子年念一，垂髮齊眉黝如漆，柳靑　粲幷一身，絳樹一聲歌二曲，吳下還京本舊家，枇杷門裏弄琵琶，蘭心自是忘憂草，暈臉天生含笑花，一老京塵久頽放，噉名來謁芙蓉帳，曹部原多玉樹枝，雲鬢亦學庭花唱，歸來未幾扇南風，和議將成烏幕空，四十萬人齊解甲，九重城闕漫傳烽，此去彼來民戰慄，中間過度須舟楫，…七日南軍入禁城，角中筇杖遠私第，此七日中大蕭索，珠歌翠舞俱休歇，玉華隨母閉門居，十指香生畫蘭筆，君學畫蘭始月餘，抵人三載畫工夫，桃花血點紅相似，柳葉眉痕翠不如，沉檀扇子施芳繪，劍玉入門價倍增，楚人香草美人貽，詎肯輕呼香扇墮？吁嗟乎！老坡以蘭喻美人，美人復爲蘭寫眞，超然於世差仙子，王者之香卽自身，離亂北京能養母，承平能作霓裳舞，露根全仿所南花，本六國人寗有土！君不見吾詩當入國史補，不獨言情爲兒女，畫蘭亦是避秦人，其中月表色秦楚，莫唱東南孔雀飛，休歌後主鳳凰兒，……新伶爲坤伶先進，早年有坤伶主席之目，詩中所述，當另有一番史實，年來頻遭挫折，人多以運厄惜之，者番冉度來滬，重讀此詩，蘭心蕙質，倘有不勝今昔之感歟</p>
<h3>王引導演　「正在想」</h3>
<p>— 銀</p>
<p>王引由電影演員擢而爲導演，成　很不錯，最近的一部「鄕下大姑娘」　座亦甚盛，於是他的導演地位由此更奠定了</p>
<p>外傳王引繼「鄕下大姑娘」之後，將導演「春燈謎」古裝片，其實不盡然，王引現在着手攝製中的是「正在想」，這是曹禺最近完成的一個舞臺劇本，現在由國聯將它搬上了銀幕，仍是時裝片，一齣富有諷刺意昧的喜劇，女主角是袁美雲，他自己沒有戲。</p>
<p>王引的導演「春燈謎」，確有此議，不過劇本還沒有改編好，所以先拍「正在想」。「春燈謎」原是梅蘭芳的戲，現在根據平劇改編爲電影，王引預備待「正在想」完成後，再籌備　　春</p>
<p>（一）王熙春</p>
<p>王熙春，過去是南京的一個歌女，『秦淮世家』中的典型人物，但是她富於進取心，對於自己的藝術生命知道愛惜，他終於沒有菲薄了自己，在相當時期的努力之下，她由淸唱轉變到正式下海，下海的地點是南京的南京大戲院，那還不過是民國二十五年間的事，與她初决合作的鬚生是趙韻聲，後來還有現在同隸卡爾登戲院的高百歲。</p>
<p>戰後，熙春到過漢口，與趙如泉安舒兀合作在天聲舞台演唱，我曾看過她一决「玉堂春」，趙如泉的藍袍，安舒元的紅袍，一决「霸王別姬」，是趙如泉的霸王，正當虞姬要舞劍的當兒，空襲警報來了，全院電炬盡熄，隔了半個鐘頭纔繼續開演，我想這也是熙春演劇史中可紀念的一日吧！</p>
<p>我的初識熙春也是在漢口，她住在天聲舞台後面一條弄堂裹，距鐵路飯店沒有多遠，已記不淸是叫做什麼里了，我去訪問她時，是在一個下午，她着了一襲很樸素的印花旗袍出來見我，她很健談，吿訴了我許多在南京鬻歌以及從師學戲的事，更談起南京的報人與田漢，田漢在南京時，是很捧她的。臨了，她又送了我一幀獻裝照片。（見上圖）</p>
<p>二十七年的夏天，熙春以移風劇社的邀請，由漢口到香港，再由香港到上海，開始與周信芳合作，在卡爾登戲院演唱，登台未久，卽以演一香妃恨」一劇而獲得了普遍的讚美。之後她又躍上了銀幕，主演過「文素臣「香妃」孟麗君　數片，而且還做了攝製孟麗君」一片的春明影片公　的老闆。</p>
<p>熙春演戲，以細膩見長，飾初解風情的　中少女最適合她的個性，她有個雅號叫小烏　，至今她還是像小姑娘那麼的天眞。（明日談孫景路）</p>
<h3>漫話魂斷藍橋</h3>
<p>— 霜庵</p>
<p>「亂世佳人」公映後，費文麗大紅特紅，這番她主演魂斷藍橋，觀衆早已望穿秋水了。魂斷藍橋裹的男主角是勞勃泰勒，最奇怪的常勞勃泰勒釗英國去拍攝「留英外史」。費文麗　充一個不　要的配角，並沒有被人注意。</p>
<p>費文麗的刻苦耐勞，値得贊許，她飾亂世佳人裏的史迦蘭，連續工作了廿三個星期，只休息了三天，這决飾魂斷藍橋瑪拉，足足費了九個星期，一天沒有休息過，在攝影塲內捉空便編結羢綫生活，捐給祖國的士兵，原來她還是救濟會的副會反。她在拍攝魂斷藍橋時爲要保持她一百另六磅的體重，拚命地吃巧克力糖，她一磅連一磅的吃，看得旁人呆了，據說她的體重曾經到過一百十磅。</p>
<p>魂斷藍橋的監製人是薛特茀蘭克林，他以往的鉅製如萬世師表，大地，天長地久等都是膾炙人口不朽之作，導演是茂文李洛埃也是首屈一指的聖手，綠野仙蹤已給我們個精刻雄偉的印像，導製入材如此，飾演人材又如彼，此片那得不成功。</p>
<p>此片在開拍前費了五個月的籌備工作，光是畫面初稿就費了七個星期。所謂畫面初稿，便是把應有的鏡頭先畫出來，作爲實地拍攝時的參考，這種一絲不茍的態度，眞値得第八藝術落後的人們　做個榜樣</p>

Since Pittman became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1933, he has made great contributions in resisting aggressor nations. Such achievements will never be forgotten by the Chinese and American people. China will always remember Pittman as China's most loyal friend. Pittman's death is a great loss to the entire United States and to President Roosevelt personally.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking at Japan by Observing the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, broke through his static state of not leaving the country and announced a formal visit to Berlin, the capital of Germany. He set off the day before yesterday and arrived yesterday. Undoubtedly, this is another extremely gloomy and fascinating prelude to the ever-changing international situation in recent times, attracting worldwide attention.</p>
<p>In previous years, Litvinov had repeatedly visited many countries, even when he was still the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, the predecessor of Molotov. Therefore, this time Molotov's visit to Germany is only his maiden voyage after taking office and cannot be hastily symbolized as a special action of Soviet diplomacy. Moreover, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally visited the Soviet capital last autumn. According to international practice, reciprocity is the rule, and Molotov should reciprocate the visit. It cannot be hastily judged as an abnormal intimacy between the two countries. This is a normal and superficial observation. Under this observation, it is also seen that Moscow does not currently have any important diplomatic negotiations that are difficult to resolve and are actively underway. Otherwise, how could Molotov take the time to travel far at this time? Therefore, what the Japanese side has been spreading, how the new ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jian San, is active and effective in the Soviet capital, still needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period of international affairs, the Soviet Foreign Minister's reciprocal visit to the German capital should not be taken lightly. Last autumn, the German Foreign Minister visited the Soviet Union and signed the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, which led to today's world. Now, although it is not necessary to formally infer that Molotov's trip will have plans and achievements that are exactly the same, the nature of this trip is not just to reciprocate the visit. In addition to the reciprocal visit, there must be another mission. What is the mission? Outsiders cannot know for sure, only by waiting for further reports can we be able to determine how the situation will unfold. But at this moment, Germany has already gained considerable benefits. Both sides are at war, with Germany and Britain as the main opposing protagonists. Among the neutral countries that can be called pivotal, the United States and the Soviet Union are mentioned in the same breath. The distance, closeness, joy, and sorrow in between are closely related to the domestic morale and public opinion, the international division and allegiance, and the future of the war situation. Now, with all eyes on them, everyone is scrambling to court the Soviet Union, fearing to fall behind. However, the Soviet Foreign Minister accepted the German invitation and set out. This is not only undeniable in Britain, but also, in Germany's domestic and international affairs, what kind of fresh material can this be used to recruit and call for? It is conceivable that the grand occasion of Berlin welcoming Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday and today may surpass the excitement and fanfare of Führer Hitler's triumphant return from Paris. The capitulation of France is a partial victory in the war, while welcoming this distinguished guest has boundless prospects, a prelude to a major diplomatic victory.</p>
<p>Prelude, just a prelude. The future is uncertain, unknowable. The world certainly has no way of knowing the contents of Molotov's mission, let alone imagine the outcome of the negotiations between the two sides. Suppose: Molotov represents the Soviet Union and goes to Berlin to support Germany and Italy's so-called creation of a new European order, and even goes to Berlin to accept the leadership of the leaders of the new order. Or suppose: Molotov goes to Germany, maintains equal status, abandons peace from now on, concludes an alliance with Germany, and declares war on Britain. Or suppose: the Soviet Union is prepared to sacrifice Turkey, sell out the Slavic origins of Southeast Europe, and support Germany and Italy's conquest of the Balkans. Or suppose: the Soviet Union has pre-recognized Germany's final victory, so Molotov is sent to Berlin to sign a preliminary coupon for the spoils. If any of these assumptions come true, then German diplomacy will be a great victory. But in normal and ordinary wisdom, one cannot help but recognize any of these assumptions as just assumptions: it is a miracle to imagine that assumptions will come true!</p>
<p>Six days ago, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Kalinin, solemnly stated that in the future, it will be difficult for the Soviet Union to maintain its impartial policy in international affairs for a long time. Coupled with Molotov's visit to Germany yesterday, if the two are combined and extended, it can be most simply explained as a sign that the Soviet Union is helping Germany fight Britain. We now have no definitive evidence or proof that can disprove the establishment of this sign. At the same time, we also believe that the two cannot be so simply explained. Because Kalinin's speech and Molotov's trip are two things with the same intention. It can be regarded as a sign that the Soviet Union is helping Germany fight Britain, and it can also be regarded as a warning that it will no longer tolerate Germany and Italy's wilful actions. It can also be regarded as implying to both Britain and Germany that it is waiting for a good price to sell, and it may not be impossible to try to resolve the difficulties. In short, both can advance and retreat, go left and right, swirl and tumble, and each has an extremely large angle and extremely large freedom to stretch, choose, and abandon at will. At this time when each is possible and yet each is unsatisfactory, it is too early to judge, and it is also too early to worry or be happy. If we try to infer, the Soviet Union is not so eager to try to get involved in the international vortex that it cannot bear it, but rather it is gradually feeling cramped and unable to settle down. Therefore, it either hopes to alleviate the overall situation, or hopes to stabilize a corner, or attempts to move the flames away from its own eyes and develop in other directions. If it is said that the Soviet Union is a little lonely and does not hesitate to jump into the whirlpool and climb into the fire pit to save people, this is an unimaginable change. Molotov will never return quietly, and the Soviet Union will never remain silent. Please watch with wide eyes the facts that will be manifested in the next few days!</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Relations Have Entered a Serious Stage; Japan's Destruction of Treaties Makes the United States Wary; Future War in the Pacific Is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Washington: Well-informed observers here recently stated that U.S.-Japan relations, since Tokyo joined the Rome-Berlin Axis, have become increasingly strained due to the development of various factors in the minds of the two peoples that are sufficient to aggravate political and diplomatic relations. Although people here have not yet predicted the possibility of war between the two countries, many observers believe that the policy currently adopted by Japan will make the United States' policy toward the Pacific more resolute. Many believe that neither the United States nor Japan can rely on the friendship between the two countries in the past as a guarantee for future difficulties, nor can either government take a measure that can generate a future friendship and favorable commercial relations to dispel the dissatisfaction of public opinion and politicians in each other's countries. The American people, whether fair or extreme in their views, believe that Japan has resorted to force on its own to resolve diplomatic and political issues. The occupation of Manchuria, the invasion of North China, and the subsequent expansion of its military operations in most parts of China, the Panay incident, the repeated bombing of Chinese cities, and the armed invasion of French Indochina, all these have made public opinion believe that Japan's policy cannot deviate from violent actions. Japan's recent attack on Vietnam has further strengthened this belief, and now there are reports that Japan will use violence to threaten the Dutch East Indies. According to various sources, Japan's opinion is that the United States has failed to understand or accurately assess the important facts such as population, economy, and external stimuli that are suitable for Japan's Far Eastern policy, and believes that the four powers cannot readily recognize its increased international status, its increased wealth, its increased industrial power, and its increased significance to the international community, which are necessary for the fate of the country. Finally, Japan has also been very dissatisfied with various actions of the United States over the years, such as the Japanese Exclusion Act of 1924, and regards it as an insult to the Japanese nation, and the California Land Restriction Law, which the Japanese also regard as discriminatory treatment against Japanese races and Japanese economic interests. In addition, Japanese politicians and newspapers often resent the United States, such as the United States urging Britain to abandon the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1922, and the United States revising the Lansing-Ishii Agreement of 1917, which recognized Japan's "special interests" in certain parts of China, are also matters of dissatisfaction among the Japanese. Regardless of whether Japan's various motives and claims are justified, Japan's actions are in fact challenging or destroying the various international procedures established by the United States. The Washington Naval Limitation Conference from 1920 to 1922 was nominally an achievement, but the facts of the next ten years have destroyed the two purposes of the United States, which were to reduce military injuries and maintain the Open Door policy in China. The United States needed a naval force balance based on a 5:3 ratio. The United States claimed high figures, arguing that Japan had a geographical advantage in any possible war, so the United States had to have a larger naval force. In fact, the U.S. Navy actually bears the practical responsibility of two oceans. This 5:3 ratio was later cancelled after the London Naval Conference in 1936. The Washington Conference also agreed on a Nine-Power Treaty and other agreements, stipulating that all countries should respect China's territorial integrity and respect the principle of equal trade opportunities. Japan's occupation of Manchuria and later the occupation of vast areas of mainland China have been considered by people here to be far away from the principles of these treaties and agreements. The U.S. government, Congress, and the public also celebrated the establishment of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, recognizing this as an important achievement in world affairs, an effective tool for world peace, and sufficient to supplement the shortcomings of the League of Nations rules. Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1932 led the American people to feel disappointed in the effectiveness of this pact. The U.S. view has been specifically stated in a famous note sent by former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to China and Japan on January 7, 1932. In this note, the U.S. government warned China and Japan that the U.S. government could not recognize any situation of facts as legal, and had no intention of recognizing any treaties or agreements between China and Japan that could affect China's central power, independence, and territorial integrity, or related to the policies of various countries toward China, such as the Open Door Policy, and damage the treaty rights or interests of the United States in China. The U.S. government has no intention of recognizing any situation treaty or agreement that would violate the obligations of the Pact of Paris, which was signed by China, Japan, and the United States on August 27, 1928. These words are still the fixed policy of the United States. The Lugouqiao Incident in July 1937 has proven to be the prelude to Japan's invasion of most of China. These military actions clearly violate most of the U.S. policies toward China and the international community. This conflict of interest became acute in December 1937, when Japanese naval aircraft sank the gunboat Panay, killing and injuring many people. Although the Japanese government later formally acknowledged that it was an "unfortunate incident" and provided compensation to the victims and their families, this incident has been deeply etched in the minds of the American people and has had a great impact on U.S.-Japan relations. On January 10, 1938, U.S. Secretary of State Hull wrote a letter to Vice President Garner, which became a fundamental principle of U.S. policy toward the world and the Far East. In the letter, Hull stated that, regarding the situation in the Far East, the United States is deeply concerned about supporting forces that are conducive to maintaining and encouraging the cause of peace through peaceful means. Japanese air raids on Chinese cities have made the United States wary of Japan, and the ban on aircraft to Japan and the change in the U.S. attitude toward Europe and Japan on the issue of the Mandate System have also caused difficulties in U.S.-Japan relations. The original intention of the Mandate System was an altruistic method to promote the interests of semi-civilized regions in the world, but in fact, Japan's mandated territories in the Pacific have gradually become "unseen places" for the United States, and the American public opinion believes that these mandated territories have become Japanese naval bases in the Pacific. For more than ten years, the views of the United States and Japan on the Pacific and the Far East have become increasingly distant, and the announcement of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has further made U.S.-Japan relations a serious state. The United States, which advocates assisting democratic countries with all resources except war, suddenly feels that it is confronting the alliance of this omnipotent country in the Pacific, and this fact has given the U.S. defense program a great stimulus and made the people of the world imagine the possibility of a future Pacific war.

<h3>Japan Prepares to Invade the Dutch East Indies; New York Newspaper's Prediction</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Daily News predicted today that Japanese troops are concentrated on Hainan Island and Taiwan, seemingly preparing to move south to the Dutch East Indies. The newspaper's editorial declared that there is no doubt that Japan is reducing its troops stationed in China and shortening its front line. According to reports, nearly 100,000 Japanese troops have been transferred from Yunnan-Guizhou provinces, North China, and the Yangtze River basin, and the destinations are Hainan Island and Taiwan. The newspaper also pointed out that the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun had launched a large-scale attack on the Dutch East Indies last Thursday and issued a warning to the government of the Dutch East Indies, accusing it of "adopting an arrogant attitude."

<h3>Japan to Hold Important Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe will hold an important meeting with the Navy and Army Ministers this week to discuss the adjustment plan of the military and government administration departments. This plan was proposed by the Navy and Army Ministries and is said to include the following points: (1) Amend the regulations governing the Imperial Headquarters so that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister can participate in the meetings of the Imperial Headquarters in the future; (2) Establish a National Defense Council, composed of the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Navy and Army; (3) Implement a liaison conference between the government and the Imperial Headquarters. Before Konoe formed the cabinet on July 21, the Prime Minister and the Foreign, Navy, and Army Ministers had reached an agreement on national defense, diplomacy, and the adjustment of the military and government administration departments. Subsequently, the Navy and Army Ministries repeatedly consulted on adjustment methods, and only recently did they agree on the plan. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Arnold's Advocacy for Active Aid to China, Warning the United States Against Withdrawing from the Far East, Grew's Emergency Meeting with Matsuoka</h3>
<p>San Francisco - Arnold, the former U.S. Deputy Commercial Attaché to Shanghai, recently stated that Japan is currently employing blitzkrieg tactics against the United States in an attempt to expel the latter from the Pacific. Unless the United States acts promptly, Arnold, who served in Shanghai for 38 years before recently returning to the United States, said, "The most serious point of the Sino-Japanese War lies in Japan's determination to completely sever China's external transportation. Although China's resistance and fighting spirit have already checked the Japanese army, which is far superior in equipment, there is concern that they may not be able to sustain their military defense structure in the future." He further warned the United States that if it wishes to maintain its reputation, authority, and interests in the Far East, it should immediately abandon its frequent public statements about not being prepared to fight there or unwilling to join the conflict in the Far East. He stated that if the United States adopts this policy, it will not only lose all its rights and interests, but also proposed a nineteen-point program to stop Japan's advance: (1) Stop making statements such as "No matter what fate befalls China, the United States will never participate in the war." (2) Stop adopting a wait-and-see policy towards the Japanese government. (3) Organize a non-partisan intelligence committee to observe the Far Eastern situation with the spirit of the Supreme Court. (4) Take precautionary steps to deal with Japanese aggression. (5) Intensify the embargo on war materials to Japan and prevent the continuation of loans to it. (6) Organize commercial institutions interested in the Far East as a collective guarantee against Japanese commercial competition. (7) Provide China with credit and financial loans. (8) Help China maintain its transportation with the outside world to ensure the continuation of its war effort. (9) Assist in China's financial recovery. He also stated, "The value of providing China with necessary assistance is far greater than the cost of fighting Japan in the future. The fate of our country is closely tied to how we handle our responsibility as a Pacific nation." (United Press, November 11)</p>
<p>Tokyo - U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, held a two-hour discussion with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka yesterday. Grew went to Matsuoka's private residence on Sunday for an emergency meeting. The content of this long conversation has not been disclosed. (United Press, November 11)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News today published a special article by Chen Bosheng, predicting Japan's future actions. It stated that after President Roosevelt's re-election, Japan's policies towards Britain and the United States will undergo fundamental changes. Japan's military strength is insufficient to fight Britain and the United States simultaneously. Japan deeply understands that empty threats will be of no avail in the future. Japan's only path forward is to resolve the Far Eastern issue based on the fundamental principles proposed by Britain and the United States. We firmly believe that within six months, Britain and the United States can defeat Japan without war and force it to accept their conditions for a fundamental resolution of the Far Eastern issue. We hope that Britain and the United States, especially President Roosevelt, can understand this point and apply great pressure on Japan, and Japan will have no choice but to yield.

<h3>Following Pittman's Passing, U.S. Senate Adjourns in Mourning, Vacancy of President Pro Tempore Temporarily Unfilled, Foreign Relations Committee Chairmanship to be Succeeded by George</h3>
<p>Washington - The sudden passing of Pittman has shocked Washington. President Roosevelt immediately sent a message of condolence to his wife, saying, "The sudden news of the death of my old friend Pittman has shocked and saddened me deeply! At this time of global survival, our Senate President Pro Tempore and Chairman of the important Foreign Relations Committee has passed away, and the nation has lost a mentor! Thirty-nine years of deep friendship and unwavering loyalty, now he has passed away, and my wife and I are deeply saddened." Secretary of State Hull also expressed his condolences, saying, "I am deeply saddened by this terrible news! It has been a great honor to work with Pittman and have a close friendship for many years. I now join friends across the country in mourning his passing." (Other remarks by important figures omitted) It is reported that the U.S. Senate will convene today, and after the meeting, it will immediately announce its adjournment to show respect and mourning. As for the vacancy of Senate President Pro Tempore left by Pittman, it may not be filled until the opening of the next Congress in early January. Before returning to his home state of Nevada, Pittman had designated Senator King of Utah as acting President Pro Tempore. (United Press, November 11)</p>
<p>Washington - After Pittman's death, Senator Walter George of Georgia is the most likely candidate to fill the vacancy of Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. George is a conservative Democrat. During the 1938 Roosevelt presidential election, there was an attempt to purge conservative elements from the Democratic Party, but it was ultimately defeated by the conservatives, and George was one of those who defeated this attempt. Senator Harrison of Mississippi, currently a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, predicted last night that George would be unanimously elected as Chairman of the Committee, as this move would cause him to resign from the highly influential Senate Finance Committee. George opposes many of President Roosevelt's domestic policies but strongly supports his foreign policy. (United Press, November 11)</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary Commits Suicide in Beiping</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Expands Evacuation Plan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Due to the still complex situation, the Hong Kong government has announced the expansion of the evacuation plan. According to this plan, the authorities are now preparing a priority list for women and children of all ethnicities who wish to leave the territory and will provide them with resettlement. The first group to leave will be the families of combatants, followed by the families of those serving in essential agencies and naval dockyards, and then the families of ordinary people. The timing of the implementation of this plan will be determined by the Hong Kong government. Although those who leave can state their desired destination, the government does not guarantee that it will comply. It is reported that Fiji is willing to accept 500 Chinese, with transportation costs paid by the government, but the cost of living may have to be covered by the evacuees themselves.

<h3>Moscow Issues Communiqué, Soviet Union to Maintain Neutrality, Molotov May Arrive in Germany Today, Important Consultations in Berlin</h3>
<p>Moscow - As the Soviet Foreign Minister is rushing to Berlin, the Soviet government announced today that the Soviet Union will maintain neutrality in the European war. Well-informed sources believe that Molotov's large delegation proves that the Soviet Union and Germany may sign an important agreement in Berlin. The Soviet communiqué issued today stated, "The Soviet Union intends to adhere to its neutral policy. Regarding this matter, Kalinin briefly mentioned it in his speech on Wednesday." It is generally believed that the upcoming talks in Berlin may resolve the disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan and create the possibility of a new agreement between the two countries. Yesterday was the 2600th anniversary of Japan's founding. The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, held a reception in Moscow, which was attended by a large number of Soviet officials. Political circles here also attach great importance to this matter. (International News Service, November 11)</p>
<p>Moscow - Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, left here for Berlin at 6:45 p.m. on the 10th, accompanied by Tevosyan, People's Commissar for the Metallurgical Industry, Dekanozov, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and Kruikov, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Trade. Those seeing him off at the station included Mikoyan, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Bukharin, members of the diplomatic corps, and the entire staff of the German Embassy. National flags were hung high in the station, and a Red Army team stood in formation to salute. German Ambassador Schulenburg also returned to Germany on the same train. (TASS, November 11)</p>
<p>Moscow - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov departed from here last night for Berlin to discuss important diplomatic events with German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Molotov's journey was accompanied by German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg and other German Embassy officials. Almost the entire Soviet cabinet went to the train station to see him off, as did many senior generals of the Red Army and foreign envoys. A guard of honor composed of Soviet Air Force personnel saluted at the station, and the military band played loudly. The station was filled with red flags and flowers, and the spotlights illuminated the station, creating a radiant scene that was reflected in the falling snow. Soviet newspapers remained silent about Molotov's mission to Germany, but diplomatic circles believe that its impact on Europe will be significant, and perhaps on the Far East as well. (United Press, November 11)</p>
<p>Moscow - Molotov's entourage to Berlin totals thirty-two people. Alexandrov, Director of the Central European Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Pavlov, Director of the Legal Department, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Dr. Schnurre, head of the German trade delegation, Counselor Warlo, and Hilger also accompanied him. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)</p>
<p>Berlin - Foreign diplomatic circles believed last night that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Berlin today, anticipating that the Rome-Berlin Axis will launch another extremely important diplomatic move in Europe. German newspapers controlled by the government prominently published this news, indicating the importance of Germany's invitation to the Soviet Foreign Minister to visit Berlin. The "Volkischer Beobachter" and the "Lokalanzeiger" both published a large photograph of Molotov on the front page. German official newspapers published official announcements, announcing Molotov's impending arrival but making no comments on the trip. As for foreign newspapers, there is no official news to be gleaned. Many believe that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will greet Molotov in Danzig. Molotov may arrive in Danzig on Tuesday, and then travel by plane to Berlin with Ribbentrop. (United Press, November 11)</p>

<h3>The Status of Countries Bordering will be Re-examined by Soviets and Germans</h3>
<p>Berlin - Today, Berlin newspapers continued to prominently feature news and commentaries about the upcoming visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Germany. The newspapers solemnly stated that this is the first time a Soviet leader has decided to travel abroad, and the impression this has made on the Soviet people is extremely profound. Soviet newspapers also published this news with large headlines. Marshal Göring's mouthpiece, the "Essener National Zeitung," made a detailed commentary this morning, stating that Molotov's visit is of extraordinary significance. Although the established treaties and contracts stipulate that important issues should be discussed frequently, his visit to Berlin is undoubtedly significant. With the continuation and expansion of the war beyond Western Europe, such measures are necessary. At this time when Britain is on the verge of collapse, extremely important issues will inevitably arise. Therefore, his visit to Berlin indicates that a united front against Britain on the European continent is about to begin. If such extraordinary gains can be achieved during short-term Soviet-German cooperation, and both countries can simultaneously restore all the territories lost during World War I, then further cooperation between the two countries will surely yield even greater gains in the future. The two governments are now using the established treaty of friendship as the foundation for further cooperation between the two nations. Countries bordering Germany and the Soviet Union that have not yet decided on their policies should re-examine their status and policies during Molotov's visit to Germany. Turkey is one such country. Soviet-German understanding will also affect the Far East, and Soviet-Japanese relations are also improving daily. This move can free the Soviet Union and Japan from their constraints and allow them to focus their efforts elsewhere. Britain is currently working to undermine Soviet-German understanding because, for its own benefit, it has consistently prevented the natural development of the two countries. Now that an understanding has been reached, the two countries are determined to adopt a united anti-British policy. What is currently being discussed are the issues arising from the war and the establishment of new agreements to pave the way for the future. The current task is to enhance Soviet-German common relations and to determine how backward countries in Europe and Asia will be positioned in the future new order. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Flies 2,000 Miles to Drop Leaflets over Danzig, Central German Cities Bombed</h3>
<p>London - According to information from responsible sources to a Reuters Air Force correspondent, British bombers flew to Danzig last night and dropped leaflets while raiding central Germany. All railway traffic routes were attacked. The scope of the British air raid was extensive last night, and details are not yet known. According to official reports, the cities of Emden, Essen, and Gelsenkirchen were also bombed by British aircraft. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<p>London - Last night's British air raid on Danzig was one of the longest bombing flights made by the British Air Force since the outbreak of the war.

It has also been learned that General Kocheryev has been appointed commander-in-chief of the Odessa Military District, replacing General Boldin. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)</p>
<p>Moscow - Petropavlovsk, the main city of the Kamchatka Peninsula, was discovered 200 years ago by the famous Russian navigator Bering. The city is located next to the mountains around Avacha Bay, with beautiful scenery. It is an ice-free port. Not far from the city are the Avacha and Koryak volcanoes. All travelers going to the far north must pass through the city. It is also a fishing vessel repair base. There are two newspapers in the city, "Kamchatka Pravda" and "Kamchatka Komsomolets," which are widely distributed in rural villages. Petropavlovsk is the administrative city of the Kamchatka region and also an educational center. There is a normal school and a political training school in the city. In addition, a fishing school is about to be established. The surrounding mountains provide citizens with places for skating and other sports, and are also a place for fox hunting. In short, Petropavlovsk is the Soviet Union's easternmost vanguard. Midnight at the Moscow Kremlin is sunrise in the city. The city now has very convenient transportation with the Soviet Union. In addition to ships, there are also airplanes carrying goods and passengers. (TASS, November 11)</p>
<h3>On the Pindus Mountain Front, Italian Forces Retreat After Losses, Italian Encirclement Strategy Fails, Greek Forces Continue to Win on Northern Route</h3>
<p>Athens - According to the latest Greek military communiqués, it has been confirmed that the elite Italian Alpine Division has been defeated on the Pindus Mountain front. The division included cavalry, the Bersaglieri Regiment (Mussolini was once a member of this regiment during the Great War), and Fascist militia. This operation was an attempt to cut off the transportation of Greek forces in Epirus. However, due to unfavorable circumstances, in order to avoid being surrounded, they abandoned a large amount of baggage and wounded soldiers and fled. Italian forces rushing from Valona to provide support also retreated at the same time. Greek forces captured some enemy soldiers and a large amount of military supplies. Locals believe that the appointment of a new commander-in-chief of the Italian army, coupled with the arrival of a large number of reinforcements from Italy, is proof that the Italian offensive against Greece has been thwarted. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<p>Southern Capital - According to the "Politiki" newspaper, Greek warships have laid mines in the straits leading to Thessaloniki, Kavala, and other Greek seaports. It has also been learned that British warships have arrived in Thessaloniki. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)</p>
<p>Athens - Greek government officials said that after Greek forces annihilated two Fascist battalions in the Pindus Mountains, an Italian unit sent to rescue the "isolated forces" was also attacked by Greek mountain troops, "like reaping wheat." A supply train rushing to resupply two Italian divisions was heavily attacked by Greek artillery. The original text states that mountain trails were "covered with Italian corpses, and rivers ran red." The Italian reinforcements were the famous Venetian Alpine Division, originally intended for blitzkrieg operations, but now no longer exists, as they were either captured or fled. Greek headquarters also stated that there have been continued victories in the Korytsa-Florina area. Authoritative sources claimed that Greek anti-aircraft fire has shot down eleven Italian aircraft since the start of the war, mostly the latest long-range bombers. However, Italian aircraft shot down by Greek aircraft in air combat are not included in this number. British aircraft launched from Greek territory have attacked Valona twice, damaging many aircraft and aircraft on the ground. Two Italian barges loaded with aircraft were sunk by British and Greek aircraft. (United Press, November 11)</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek High Command stated that Greek forces defending Yannina defeated two more Italian battalions. After this setback, Italian forces in the western Ionian coast area retreated yesterday. Official reports state that two Italian mechanized battalions were completely annihilated in the Kalamas River area yesterday. The people of Athens were still celebrating Saturday's victory yesterday. The news of the above-mentioned victory has further boosted Athenian morale. Officials said that yesterday's new victory has made the Greek position in the war more favorable. Greece's chances are now better than when the Italian army began invading Greece. At the same time, it was heard that Italian forces are now using paratroopers in the mountainous area of Korytsa, dropping food and orders to troops trapped in the mountains.

<h3>Greek Forces Capture Thousands of Italian Soldiers in the Pindus Mountains</h3>
<p>Athens - The Greek High Command announced today that thousands of Italian soldiers were captured in the Pindus Mountains last night. A communiqué issued by the Italian High Command stated that these Italian soldiers preferred to be captured rather than starve or be annihilated, so they surrendered without offering any resistance. Greek forces also seized a large number of artillery pieces, tanks, and a large amount of military supplies. However, the Greek side acknowledged that although Greek reinforcements arrived in the mountainous area in a timely manner, the number of Greek casualties is still very significant. According to battle reports arriving here today, Greek forces are now advancing to the south bank of the Kalamas River. It is generally believed that the Greek victory on the front lines has removed the direct threat to Yannina and thwarted the Italian offensive against Epirus. At the same time, Greek forces in the west are stepping up their encirclement of Korytsa, seizing a large amount of Italian supplies and repelling Italian reinforcements. It is reported that the Royal Air Force has assisted the Greek Air Force in bombing the key Albanian port of Vlora and the Italian bases of Brindisi and Taranto. The joint British and Greek bombing of Italian bases has greatly hampered the movement of Italian reinforcements and the supply of supplies via the Strait of Taranto. At the same time, it was learned that U.S. Minister to Greece MacVeagh informed Greek Prime Minister Metaxas that the United States is willing to provide medical supplies to Greece.

<h3>British Aircraft Stationed in Crete, Islanders Form Irregular Army</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent in Greek-owned Crete cabled that the hatred of the Cretan islanders towards the Italians is now greater than ever. This is the only effect of the Italian air raids on the island. After British aircraft arrived on the island to be stationed, the islanders' belief became stronger, all saying that since British aircraft have now come to protect them, Italian aircraft will not dare to come again to carry out wanton killings. The chieftains of the various tribes on the island have already gathered the brave and skilled islanders and are preparing to form an irregular Cretan army to assist the Greek forces on the island in combat.

<h3>Italian Side Uses Aircraft to Supply Mountain Climbing Troops with Food and Ammunition</h3>
<p>Southern Capital - According to news from the Politiki newspaper here, yesterday was peaceful on the Greek front due to extremely adverse weather conditions. Heavy fog, low-hanging black clouds, and constant rain prevented artillery activity. Soldiers on both sides suffered from the severe cold. Food and ammunition for the Italian mountain climbing troops on the front lines are being supplied by aircraft. Paratroopers were dropped in several places. The Italian advance is clearly visible, with large contingents advancing in an endless stream. The newspaper stated that the Greek situation is quite difficult because supplies are not arriving on time, and reserves are repeatedly hindered in the mountains. According to the Greek side, artillery that the Greek army did not have at the beginning of the war has now been transported to the front lines. They are of a very large caliber and are the latest models. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)</p>

<h3>Continuous Earthquakes in the Balkans: Severe Disaster in Romania; No Intact Buildings in Bucharest; Thousands Dead and Injured; Major Oilfields on Fire</h3>
<p>Lisbon - The Coimbra University Observatory reports that an earthquake occurred in the Balkans this morning. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Vienna - At 0:35 AM (Central European Time) today, another earthquake occurred in Romania. Although it lasted only a few seconds, some houses collapsed. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>London - German radio broadcasts from the official news agency report that Bucharest felt the first earthquake this morning, and it was very strong. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Since the most violent earthquake in the modern history of the Balkans shook Bucharest and other parts of Romania this morning, the death toll in Bucharest alone is at least several thousand. Two more tremors occurred yesterday at 3 PM and 7 PM, plunging the people of Bucharest back into terror and chaos. Although the houses that did not suffer this great natural disaster were filled with frightened people crying out for refuge, the two earthquakes in the afternoon caused little damage. Since Bucharest suffered five earthquakes, several buildings have collapsed and been damaged, including the Royal Palace, the Foreign Ministry, and the American Embassy. Therefore, Bucharest is now a smoking ruin. Many small cities in Romania have been completely destroyed, and the number of deaths and injuries is increasing. It is learned that when rescue workers were excavating rubble, more than a thousand people died in the cities of Ploiesti, Calarasi, and Giurgiu. Hordes of refugees are entering and leaving Bucharest, as the people do not know where to go to avoid death. According to seasoned observers, they have never experienced such an earthquake in their lives, and the only one that can be compared to it occurred one hundred and thirty-eight years ago. Preliminary investigations indicate that property losses amount to hundreds of millions. The disaster not only struck a large area of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, but also the oilfields in the area, which are an important source of oil for German war machines, are on fire, according to sources in Ploiesti. German troops stationed in Romania are assisting the public in excavating rubble piles to save lives and property. No building in Bucharest was spared damage in this earthquake. According to official statistics, six hundred people were crushed to death when the Carlton Palace apartment building, the largest ten-story building in Bucharest, collapsed into a pile of wood and reinforced concrete. The government has used radio to notify all construction engineers to assist the government in selecting which buildings should be demolished to avoid further casualties. Hotels have been converted into hospitals, and the magnificent lounges are filled with ragged and unclean men, women, and children, some squatting and some lying on the floor. The groans of the injured being given first aid are endless. Furthermore, according to officials, if the firefighters had not worked quickly, the entire city would have been reduced to ashes. Yesterday, it was reported that several high-ranking German and Italian military officers had died, but this has not yet been fully confirmed. The buildings on Bulevardul Bratianu and Bulevardul Brezoianu have been almost completely destroyed. The epicenter of the earthquake seemed to be in the center of Bucharest. Several sections of the railroad were broken, and the post office building was completely ruined. (International, 11th)</p>
<p>London - According to reports received in London, the earthquake in Bucharest yesterday caused considerable damage. The eight-story Carlton Building collapsed, and it is feared that up to two hundred people were buried in the rubble. The new Romanian Foreign Ministry building was completely cracked from top to bottom, and the fourteen-story telephone company building was also greatly damaged. There are no intact houses in Bucharest. Many streets are impassable due to piles of rubble. The most modern commercial street in Bucharest, Victoria Avenue, is also blocked in many places. The city center is now cordoned off with ropes. Telephone service has been disrupted for a long time, and traffic is restricted. The only vehicles seen on the streets on Sunday morning were ambulances transporting the injured to hospitals. Thirty people died and a hundred were injured in Galati on the Danube River due to the earthquake. In Ploiesti, the center of Romania's oil industry, most of the oil refineries were damaged. The earthquake was also felt in Bulgaria, causing some casualties. An earthquake also occurred in Marseille, France. Romanian radio broadcast a request for all construction engineers in the country to register for service so that they could inspect the condition of buildings and how many people lived there in order to avoid further casualties. Many railway tunnels have cracks, and trains have been suspended, pending inspection by engineers in sections. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Forty-six bodies were recovered from the ruins of the collapsed twelve-story Carlton Building this morning. Nine of them were still recognizable, while the rest were missing their faces and could not be identified. Seventeen seriously injured people were recovered and are still expected to recover. Only twenty bodies have been found in other ruins in Romania so far. The exact death toll is difficult to obtain at this time. Money and other valuables recovered by the rescue teams from the bodies were handed over to the authorities for safekeeping. German soldiers also participated in the rescue work. According to the Bucharest Observatory, the earthquake lasted forty seconds. According to the Post Office, telephone communications have been mostly restored throughout Romania, but telegraph service has not yet been restored in many places. The telephone exchange building in Bucharest was slightly damaged. Many houses in Ploiesti collapsed. It is now known that seven people died and forty were injured in that city. The number of victims is undoubtedly more than that. Two hundred houses collapsed in the Târgoviște district, and the number of casualties is still being investigated. The Doftana Prison near Câmpina also collapsed, and most of the inmates died under the rubble. It is reported that forty-five people died and more than a hundred were injured in Focșani. The town of Buzău was completely destroyed, and twenty-three bodies and seventy-one injured people were recovered. Thirty bodies were found in Galati today, and more than a thousand people were injured and are now being treated in hospitals. Craiova, which is farther from the epicenter of the earthquake, had several houses collapsed, five deaths, and six serious injuries. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria - Following the earthquake in Romania, there are large fires everywhere. The large fires in Romania can be seen across the river from the Danube in Bulgaria. According to information obtained here, several villages in Romania have been completely destroyed. Damage in Bulgaria was minimal, and few people were injured by collapsing houses. The Sofia Earthquake Institute declared that this earthquake was the most severe since 1928. The cities of Plovdiv and Chirpan were largely destroyed in 1928. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria - Regarding the earthquake in Romania, according to the Meteorological Observatory here, two earthquakes were felt in various parts of Bulgaria, and there was a rumbling sound underground. This was most evident in the Danube region. Houses in several cities and villages collapsed. In the Svishtov region, several houses and one church and one mosque were damaged. In Nikopol, a mosque and some houses also collapsed. No one died in Bulgaria, but several people were injured. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey - A sudden and violent earthquake occurred here on Saturday night, particularly in Sinop and Inebolu on the Black Sea coast, but there have been no reports of destroyed houses or injuries. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - The capital of Yugoslavia was affected by the Romanian earthquake. There was no damage in the capital. Residents in various places were awakened from their dreams. Several chimneys were destroyed in Negotin and Zajecar in eastern Serbia. Residents fled to the streets to spend the night, fearing another earthquake. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow, Soviet Union - The earthquake in Romania also affected the Soviet Union, and Ukraine suffered the most. Several houses were destroyed in Chisinau, and walls collapsed in Kharkiv. The earthquake lasted an hour, and the most violent earthquake lasted six minutes. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Moscow Observatory declared that yesterday's earthquake in Moscow was one of the strongest in many years. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was in the Balkans, residents of Moscow were awakened from their sleep. Odessa, Poltava, and Akkerman were also affected. Many houses collapsed in Kishinev. The Council of People's Commissars of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic has appointed a relief committee to handle the aftermath. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Franco-German Formal Agreement: Negotiations Impossible; Laval Returns to Vichy; French Press Reviews Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Vichy - Cabinet Minister and Foreign Minister Laval has returned here after talks with German Air Minister General Göring in Paris. Semi-official sources commented that as long as the Anglo-German war continues, there is no room for France and Germany to negotiate and discuss a formal peace agreement. The current issue lies in creating an atmosphere of mutual understanding between France and Germany and enlisting public opinion in both countries to promote rapprochement. The French government's adoption of this policy in the current environment is a wise move, and the outcome will be seen in the future. As for the meeting between Laval and Göring, it was a necessary step after the historic meeting between Marshal Pétain and German Chancellor Hitler in Montoire. In short, the French people should recognize that the Franco-German cooperation policy is the only way for France to recover. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, France - The newspapers here today continue to focus on Franco-German relations as a topic of commentary. In addition to expressing general opinions, some authors have examined the possibilities of cooperation between the two countries in detail. Frossard, the former Minister of Propaganda and Minister of Information, also published an article in the "Slogan Newspaper," stating that since the Munich Agreement of 1938, most of the French people were very excited, regardless of the fact that this matter damaged the country's prestige. The reason for this is that they hoped that the age-old feud between France and Germany could be eliminated. Therefore, France does not hate Germany, and the same is true in Germany, which has no intention of hating France. Resentment can only arise between them when France tries to enslave Germany or Germany tries to divide France. Conversely, if both parties cooperate under certain conditions, that is, under the condition that the defeated country does not bear unlimited burdens, then cooperation is entirely possible. In short, once the defeated country has paid the price of its defeat, there should no longer be any distinction between the victorious country and the defeated country. Marshal Pétain's recent speech has elaborated on how the German people should deal with victory. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>All of French Equatorial Africa Falls into Free French Hands; Capture of Libreville Confirmed</h3>
<p>London - According to military news arriving in London this morning from Léopoldville, General de Gaulle's "Free French Forces" have occupied Libreville, the capital of French Gabon. Therefore, all of France's colonies in Equatorial Africa have come under their control. Informed sources know that the Vichy government has telegraphed the authorities in French Gabon to stop their pointless resistance. The initial report of the attack on Libreville came from the Vichy government, which claimed that a squadron of British light cruisers shelled the city on Saturday, covering the landing of Free French infantry. The Vichy government claimed that the French garrison in Libreville rose up and attacked the landing forces commanded by de Gaulle, leading to fierce fighting. However, the British Admiralty does not believe that the British Navy shelled Libreville or assisted the Free French forces. Today, observers here are satisfied with the success of the attack on Libreville and the occupation of French Gabon. Observers say that this move can greatly eliminate the shameful memory of the failure to attack Dakar, which the British newspapers at the time called "the great failure of Dakar." (International, 11th)</p>
<p>London - The news that General de Gaulle's forces have occupied Libreville in French Equatorial Africa has been officially confirmed by London today. People here believe that the occupation of this important coastal base is an important victory, as the occupation of Libreville can guarantee the safety of the British South Atlantic shipping lanes. It is said that casualties during the shelling of Libreville were relatively light. The local people warmly welcomed General de Gaulle, who has been appointed as the governor of the area. It is said that several British warships are currently anchored in Libreville. (International, 11th)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to a report from General Têtu, the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa, de Gaulle's aircraft continued to bomb Libreville, destroying a hospital, a Catholic church, and a clergyman's residence, killing many women and children. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Franco-German Transportation Agreement Established</h3>
<p>Vichy - The French Ministry of Industry and the German Commissioner for the Occupied Territories have reached an agreement allowing the free transportation of the following items between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France without restriction: medicines, surgical instruments, clothing, eyeglasses, perfumes, cosmetics, used furniture, newspapers, magazines, and archival documents from public offices. However, medical instruments made of precious or platinum metals must have a transportation permit before they can be released. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Empress Arrives Safely in Britain</h3>
<p>London - The Changxing Company's postal ship Japanese Empress (26,000 tons), which was attacked by German aircraft in the Atlantic two days ago, safely arrived in Britain today. According to a naval bulletin, the ship suffered minor damage, but there were no casualties. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Unemployed Japanese Mob Beat Up Officials</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun reports that a high-ranking government official was recently beaten up by a mob of people unemployed due to the new construction movement. This shameful phenomenon is due to the fact that both the official and the unemployed have failed to understand the true meaning of creating a new order. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>A Painful History of the European War (2) The Great Tragedy of France</h3>
<p>Bordeaux was utterly unprepared for the influx of government agencies, diplomatic corps, and the press. The city already held a million refugees, with countless more arriving continuously. The streets were clogged with vehicles, which many refugees used as temporary shelters.</p>
<p>A large number of congressmen, officials, civil servants, and others, sensing the end was near, clung closely to the government. Bankers, industrialists, merchants, writers, and their wives and mistresses all prepared to relocate time and again. The streets, cafes, hotels, consular offices issuing passports, and corridors of various ministries were crammed with people. People met and exchanged news, while spreading baseless rumors. Archduke Otto, the heir to the Habsburg throne, young but already balding, wearing a raincoat and with a furrowed brow, paced back and forth in front of the police station. General Haller, the Polish envoy, with his white beard flowing, was in earnest conversation with former Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot, who was wearing a black coat. The entrance of the Splendide Hotel was crowded with men and women from various branches of the Rothschild financial dynasty, who had fled London, Paris, and Vienna.</p>
<p>Amidst this incredible atmosphere, the French government ministers were meeting several times a day, awaiting the outcome of Reynaud's final appeal to Roosevelt. They were also considering moving the government to Morocco or Algeria, or even to England to continue the war. The temporary residences of the President and the Prime Minister were on the same street, only a hundred yards apart. The road between them was constantly filled with traffic, the cars of high officials coming and going. Cabinet meetings lasted four or five hours. Pétain was ardently calling for an armistice, and his supporters were growing in number. This veteran general, over seventy years old, dressed in his old military uniform, spoke haltingly but with great eloquence. He said, "Gentlemen, please think of France's future. We cannot abandon the country and let it fend for itself, nor can we allow it to be trampled upon by others. We must remain on this sacred land and care for our people. Before the victorious enemy, without hesitation, refuses to negotiate, we must obtain guarantees to protect our youth and our cities and towns. This way, the opportunity for revival can still be in our hands."</p>
<p>Foch, Baudouin, and the newly appointed Minister of Information, Prouvost (publisher of the Paris-Soir newspaper), all stood on the same side, supporting Pétain's insightful views. Prouvost said, "If we move elsewhere from here, the people will not understand. They will think we ran away with the treasure chests."</p>
<p>Pétain continued, "We must hurry, we must hurry. Verdun, Metz, Sedan, Épernay, Belfort, Toul, Chaumont, Orléans have all fallen."</p>
<p>Weygand's headquarters had already moved to Vichy and now had to retreat further to near Bordeaux. Weygand was also summoned to the meeting.</p>
<p>He said, "The situation is beyond repair. The Maginot Line has been bypassed, and the Alpine defenders will soon be surrounded. We have only a few isolated troops fighting on, who cannot communicate with each other or with us. Most of the remaining aircraft have been destroyed on the ground."</p>
<p>Reynaud still wanted to continue the war. He said, "We cannot abandon the fleet. We cannot lose everything, and even more, we cannot lose our honor. The resources of the colonies are still not exhausted." He even telephoned Churchill, urging him to come to Bordeaux for a final meeting. Churchill initially refused but later proposed a new suggestion: the formation of a Franco-British Union, governing both nations together until the end of the war. The resources, wealth, territories, and colonies of both countries would be under the jurisdiction of the Union government.</p>
<p>Monnet supported this suggestion. General de Gaulle was an even more enthusiastic supporter. Other cabinet members believed that this plan would merely place France under British control. Roosevelt's reply to Reynaud's appeal was only empty words of comfort, expressing willingness to support the continuation of the war. At this time, France had only five hundred fighter planes on the front lines.</p>
<p>Parliament was in recess, but several hundred senators and representatives were milling about in the city hall. Among them were many who advocated for an armistice. Only the white-haired President of the Senate, Jeanneney, and the towering President of the Chamber of Deputies, Herriot, opposed surrender.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 16, Pétain insisted that the cabinet decide on the major plan of war or peace. Therefore, another meeting was convened, presided over by President Lebrun, who supported Pétain's proposal. Lebrun requested that the cabinet make an immediate decision and suggested that the resolution be signed by the two generals, Pétain and Weygand, and announced to the nation. At this time, everyone knew that the rights of civilian officials had been completely swept away. The people, especially the soldiers, had to accept their fate based solely on the prestige of Pétain and Weygand. Finally, Chautemps tried to mediate the dissenting opinions, proposing that the Swiss government first make a tentative approach to Hitler. Thus, the faction supporting the armistice declared victory.</p>
<p>Reynaud resigned immediately. That evening, Pétain formed a new government, with Weygand as Minister of Defense and Darlan as Minister of the Navy. The elegant Baudouin, who had been attached to Pétain for a week, surprisingly obtained the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Laval had spent almost the entire previous day in conversation with the Spanish ambassador to France, Lequerica. Pétain summoned him, intending to offer him the post of Minister of Justice. Laval refused. He would accept nothing less than the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was afraid of bearing the infamy of signing the armistice agreement and had no real intention of joining the cabinet. Finally, he explained the content of his long conversation with the Spanish ambassador. Pétain was looking for a suitable secret envoy and immediately invited Franco's representative. Lequerica, accompanied by the papal envoy Valeri, met with Pétain, and both agreed to convey the intention of an armistice to the German and Italian regimes. This proposal had to be presented as an honorable proposal between soldiers.</p>
<p>That night, Pétain did not go to bed to sleep peacefully. He only sat down in an armchair near dawn, covering his knees with a blanket, for a few hours of rest. He had done this before when commanding the battle at Verdun, knowing that tomorrow's difficulties would be even greater after a day of difficult work, and rested in this way to recover his strength.</p>
<p>On June 18, Hitler and Mussolini met in Munich and decided on the terms of the armistice with France, but the German army was still advancing. While occupying Rennes in Brittany and crossing the lower Loire River, they also seized Nevers and reached the Swiss border. Three days later, they occupied Vichy and Lyon. Bordeaux had not received any reply from Berlin or Rome, and the situation was tense to the point of being unbearable.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it was reported that Mandel had been arrested. He was dining with the famous actress Béatrice Bretty in one of Bordeaux's most luxurious restaurants when he was suddenly arrested by the police. Mandel was arrested! Was this an attempt to seize the government by force? Was this the first demand made by the German side? In fact, Mandel had been accused by Bordeaux citizens of hiding weapons and plotting to overthrow the Pétain government, so he was detained for three hours. He then received an apology from Pétain and regained his freedom.</p>
<p>Like this kind of absurd rumor, there was also the rumor that Reynaud had left France for the United States. In reality, Reynaud was pacing back and forth in the lobby of the Splendide Hotel, his attitude very calm, and his self-confidence undiminished. The only member of the old government who had already left France was General de Gaulle. He was an ambitious separatist, and after predicting this great tragedy, he went to London to form the French National Committee to oppose the Pétain government.</p>
<p>The German response did not arrive until the 19th, requesting that France "appoint plenipotentiary ambassadors, empowered to sign an armistice treaty. After the German side agrees, it will designate the date and place for a meeting with the German plenipotentiary ambassador." The French government immediately nominated Generals Huntziger and Prételat, Admiral Le Luc, and former Ambassador to Poland Noël. They went immediately to Compiègne, to the same train car where German generals had accepted surrender terms in 1918, to determine France's fate. That night, Bordeaux was again subjected to heavy bombing by the Germans.</p>
<p>There were lengthy secret talks during the day about the disposition of the French fleet. British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, accompanied by British Ambassador to France Sir Campbell, flew to Bordeaux to consult with Pétain and Minister of the Navy Darlan and Foreign Minister Baudouin. They agreed that under no circumstances would the French fleet be handed over to Germany. Darlan also pleaded at the next cabinet meeting that the French fleet should not be used to fight against Britain and proposed that France itself disarm the ships. The entire cabinet agreed.</p>
<p>On June 20, the French government felt that there was no guarantee of obtaining acceptable terms from Germany, so it provisionally decided to move the government to Perpignan. The office of the Chamber of Deputies secretly chartered a ship to carry away some of the people most hated by the Germans from Bordeaux. On this ship were Daladier and his son Jean, Mandel, Campinchi, Kerillis, and a dozen members of parliament. A few days later, the ship arrived in Casablanca, North Africa. Daladier, unaccustomed to the rough seas, suffered severe seasickness. Campinchi's teeth were knocked out. When they landed, they were treated as fugitives.</p>
<p>On June 22, there was still no news from Compiègne, probably because the terms were too harsh. Members of the cabinet were seriously considering moving to North Africa. They firmly decided that if the conditions were too harsh, they would implement this plan. Vehicles and ships were prepared to carry a group of ministers and office staff from various ministries to Algeria.</p>
<p>On June 23, General Huntziger thanked the German army for setting up a telephone line in a very short time, so that he could communicate with Pétain at any time and report the German conditions. (In reality, Bordeaux had already been informed of these terms six hours earlier by Colonel Bébert, the special envoy of the Spanish Foreign Minister. The Spanish Foreign Minister's information was conveyed by the German Ambassador Stohrer). The terms, after slight modifications in detail by the French plenipotentiary ambassadors, were fully accepted. The Franco-Italian armistice agreement was also signed on the same day.</p>
<p>At 0:35 on June 25, the war officially ended. From the declaration of war to this point, France had fought for only two hundred and ninety-seven days, and actually fought for only forty-seven days. Now it laid down its weapons, with one-half of its territory occupied. (End)</p>

Therefore, banks and other institutions have made arrangements for the receiving procedures today to avoid temporary congestion. It is expected that the original purpose will be achieved.</p>
<p>Temporary Precautions</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, in light of today's anniversary of the Father of the Nation's birth, have implemented temporary precautions from yesterday to prevent unexpected events within the concessions. All police stations have been ordered to increase patrols, search pedestrians and vehicles. It has been rumored that all non-essential roads, such as Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, will be closed and traffic will be blocked. A reporter inquired with the police department, and it was said that the concession authorities had no plans for such measures, but are only implementing normal temporary precautions. Also, today is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of Chinese troops to the west. Because it coincides with the Father of the Nation's birthday, the solemn commemoration has been postponed by one day.</p>
<h3>### Death of Pittman: Telegram Sent to the United States Expressing Condolences, Pittman's Life Dedicated to Upholding Justice, Loud Mourning in Shanghai Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>Following the death of Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the public in this city, considering Pittman as China's most loyal friend, whose life was dedicated to criticizing aggression, upholding justice, and possessed a chivalrous spirit admired by all nations, expressed deep condolences upon his passing. Relatives and friends of Pittman residing in Shanghai sent a telegram to Pittman's family in the United States expressing condolences. Various Chinese organizations also believe that although Pittman has passed away, his spirit of upholding justice has established the United States' consistent anti-aggression policy, so they also asked the Ambassador to the United States to convey their condolences.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Troops Prepare to Withdraw from Xiaoshan, Heavy Losses in Zhuji and Shaoxing</h3>
<p>According to organizations from Zhejiang Province residing in Shanghai, a telegram received yesterday from eastern Zhejiang reported that after the Chinese troops recovered Qianqing on the eastern front and Linpu on the southern front in the battles south of the Qiantang River, the Japanese troops have retreated and concealed themselves in the county seat of Xiaoshan. Recently, they have also burned their defensive works at the east gate, showing signs of abandoning the county seat of Xiaoshan, which has greatly encouraged the residents of the city, awaiting a surprise attack by the Chinese troops. Order in Zhuji and Shaoxing has been restored. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway still starts from Zhuji, but the city has suffered significant losses and the shops have not fully reopened. The suburbs of Shaoxing are also desolate, and the main street from Shuicheng Lane to Dachan Temple has become a field of rubble. About 90% of the houses near Xiguo Gate have also been burned. The city is filled with refugees, urgently awaiting relief.</p>
<h3>### Foreigners Hold Solemn Ceremony to Commemorate the European Armistice, Present Wreaths to Honor Unknown Heroes, and Pray that Justice Will Ultimately Triumph Over Might</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the armistice of the First World War. Looking back on the past and considering the future, one cannot help but feel endless emotions. British, American, and French residents of this city, with solemn attitudes, successively went to the Peace Memorial on the Bund to present wreaths, paying tribute to the unknown heroes of a previous generation who sacrificed their lives for justice and peace, and praying that justice will ultimately triumph over might. Although the ceremony was simple, it had great significance. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>British and French Residents Jointly Present Wreaths</p>
<p>British and French residents of this city held a joint memorial ceremony in front of the Peace Memorial at ten o'clock. The French presented five wreaths, and the British presented a large wreath of red poppies. The British stood on the left side of the memorial, represented by British Consul-General George. In addition, participants included Commander Hemphill of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the military attaché of the British Consulate-General, and representatives of the Great Britain Victory Society and the British Legion, totaling more than thirty people, each wearing a bright red flower on their chest, arranged in two rows. The French stood on the right side of the memorial, represented by about ten Frenchmen in military uniforms, including the French Consul-General, representatives of veterans of the war, and representatives of the French General Association and the French Municipal Council. It is said that half of these French residents were supporters of General de Gaulle of France. In a solemn atmosphere, they silently prayed. At this time, hundreds of foreigners from various countries gathered there, removing their hats and standing at attention to pay their respects. It was also reported that the French held a memorial service at St. Joseph's Church at 9:30 AM.</p>
<p>American Ceremony Solemn and Grand</p>
<p>The most impressive memorial ceremony yesterday was the one held by American residents yesterday morning at eleven o'clock. At that time, Colonel Baker, Major Hamilton, two detachments of the 4th Marine Regiment, and representatives of various American organizations in this city held a twenty-minute memorial ceremony in front of the Peace Memorial. When the color guard of the American troops raised the American flag and saluted the flag, there were many American and other people watching. Then, Colonel Baker and Major Hamilton presented a large chrysanthemum wreath in front of the statue. Following them, Mr. Matti, a giant in the American automobile industry, represented the American Legion, Mrs. Allie and Mrs. Punt represented the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and Mrs. Dunlap and Mrs. Tomlinson represented the Daughters of the American Revolution, who presented wreaths to the statue. Then, Chaplain Cullum of the 4th Marine Regiment gave a five-minute speech and prayer. Chaplain Cullum said in his speech, "We must dedicate ourselves to justice and righteousness so that these great people beneath the tomb, though dead, shall live on." The final scene of this moving ceremony was the performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" by the bugle corps of the 4th Marine Regiment.</p>
<p>Thousands of People Watched</p>
<p>When the American troops held the memorial ceremony, thousands of people watched nearby. The police authorities of the two concessions dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order on the spot, and placed iron nets and wooden fences on the sidewalk and around the statue across the road from the statue to prevent the audience from approaching. However, because many foreigners from various countries and American troops participated in the ceremony, the road was blocked and traffic was temporarily cut off for five minutes. After the ceremony, the wreaths sent by foreigners from various countries remained in front of the statue for viewing. People came to visit throughout the day. The Shanghai Municipal Police sent many patrolmen to guard nearby.</p>
<h3>### Barbed Wire Still Erected at the Western End of Jing'an Temple Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that after Corporal Saito Seiichi of the Japanese Military Police was assassinated on YuYuan Road on October 18, the Japanese authorities immediately took precautions in the Western District, causing British Shanghai Municipal Council buses to only travel to Jing'an Temple. Only single-decker buses traveled west of Jing'an Temple. This lasted for more than three weeks, until yesterday (the 10th) when double-decker buses resumed service west of Jing'an Temple and on Haig Road. At the same time, because of repeated crimes in the Western District, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department erected barbed wire obstacles at the intersections of the roads leading to Haig Road and the areas outside Jing'an Temple, and at the intersections of Great Western Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and YuYuan Road. These have not yet been removed.</p>
<h3>### Christian Groups Pray for the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The International Fellowship of Prayer and the Christian Federation, in view of the raging flames and the devastated scenes everywhere, notified churches across the country to hold a national prayer meeting yesterday, specifically praying for the current situation to avert a great disaster. Various church groups in this city held prayers for the current situation in the morning and a joint prayer meeting in the afternoon. Many Christians participated enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>### Litigation Stagnation in the French Concession, Judges Almost All Resigning, Bar Association Relocated Elsewhere, Avenue Haig Presents a Desolate Scene</h3>
<p>All Chinese courts established in the French Concession based on the agreements signed between China and France have been seized since the 8th of this month. The courts, considering that the authorities of the French Concession disregard the agreements and allow illegal intruders, were forced to withdraw. Since then, the official Chinese courts have suspended their functions. According to the orders of the National Government, any judgments claiming to be from courts in the French Concession will be considered invalid. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with various parties yesterday and compiled the news as follows:</p>
<p>Bar Association Relocated to Work Elsewhere</p>
<p>It is reported that when the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court was seized, more than 170,000 of the litigants' bail money had not been taken out and fell into the hands of the intruders. As for the Shanghai Second Special District Court, someone had been secretly watching in advance, and even a newspaper could not be taken out at will. As for the Bar Association, it had moved out of the concession beforehand. After discussions among many people, it was believed that lawyers should abide by the law, and since the legitimate courts in the French Concession have suspended their functions, they should of course stop appearing in court. Therefore, there were few vehicles on Avenue Haig yesterday.</p>
<p>Enforcement Office Staff All Resign</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Court's Civil Enforcement Office, which specializes in civil enforcement cases, had more than ten staff members. It is reported that since the day the court was seized, the judges Shu Chang and Lu Jiarui, and the clerks Ma Suquan, Xu Lujia, and Wang Duxing, have all resigned. All civil enforcement cases in the "court" are currently stalled.</p>
<p>Case Stagnation Difficult to Restore</p>
<p>The English Great American Evening News reported that most of the prosecutors and inspectors of the French Concession High Court Third Branch and the Second Special Court have refused to go to the "court" to work. Other lawyers and French Concession police lawyers have also refused to appear in court, so since last Friday (the 8th), all lawsuits that have not been decided have been stalled. It will be difficult to restore the original situation for a while. However, it is reported that some newly "appointed" staff members may take office in the next day or two. At the same time, the French Concession police continued to maintain strict precautions in front of the court buildings this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to prevent accidents. Officials have refused to comment on the court issue, but it is reported that talks may continue today to resolve the current difficulties.</p>
<h3>### Ningbo Plague Still Rampant</h3>
<p>Recently, a plague broke out in Ningbo, causing considerable damage. A team of more than thirty people from the Central Anti-Epidemic Team arrived in Ningbo from Songyang the night before yesterday and began their work of eradicating and preventing the plague yesterday. Yesterday, sixteen people in the Class A Isolation Hospital were infected with the plague, and two more died. The remaining fourteen were also in critical condition. The Class C Isolation Hospital continued to admit four new patients, bringing the total to twelve. Among them, five have improved after treatment and will be discharged soon. Also, the Yin County Anti-Epidemic Office received a telegram from the Cixi Urban Area Anti-Epidemic Office yesterday, stating that two plague patients living on Kaiming Street had fled to Cixi and died there yesterday. The Cixi Anti-Epidemic Team buried them in the wilderness and disinfected the houses where they lived. Also, the search team of the security group continued to find two residents who had fled from the plague area yesterday and have been sent to the isolation hospital.</p>
<h3>US Ship Evacuation Starts Today; Kobe Port Not Berthing; Only a Few US Citizens Evacuate on This Ship; Washington Ship Expected to be Crowded</h3>
<p>The second US evacuation ship, the "Mariposa" postal ship, entered the Wusongkou at 9:40 AM yesterday and sailed to the No. 11 and 12 buoys at around 11:00 AM to dock. The small boat for crew members to disembark arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 12:20 PM yesterday. The postal ship will stay overnight in Shanghai and is scheduled to set sail for Qinhuangdao at 9:30 AM this morning, passing through Incheon (Korea) and Honolulu, etc., on its way back to San Francisco. The shuttle boats for evacuating the Americans boarded at 9:00 PM and 12:00 AM last night from the New Customs Wharf. According to the company, only 83 tickets were sold for the evacuation of Americans in this city. The number of Americans evacuated from North China, Tianjin, and other places who are concentrated in Qinhuangdao to board the ship is unknown. Mr. Pippin, a commissioner of the Matson Company, decided to come to Shanghai by the "Monterey" postal ship to assist the United States President Lines in handling the ship ticket matters. Now that the official business is completed, he will return to the country with the "Mariposa" postal ship this morning.</p>
<p>Safe Journey to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the second US evacuation ship "Mariposa" arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 AM today (the 11th) and is immediately preparing to set sail for North China and Korea early tomorrow morning (the 12th). The "Mariposa" weighs 19,000 tons and is luxuriously equipped. The hull is painted white and shines brightly. After arriving in Shanghai, it docked at the No. 11 and 12 buoys. A group of personnel from the United States President Lines boarded the ship to take care of it. Each side of the ship and the stern are painted with huge American flags. It is said that this flag was painted since the outbreak of the European War, not added because it was sailing to the Far East. According to Captain Meyer told reporters that the ship sailed from Honolulu and had a safe journey. It only encountered bad weather east of the Ogasawara Islands for three days. However, this is not unusual, because ships often encounter bad weather when passing east of the island.</p>
<p>Kobe Port Definitely Not Berthing</p>
<p>The "Mariposa" did not carry a single passenger upon arriving here. During the journey to Shanghai, the crew had pastimes such as a movie room and a swimming pool. The entire ship can accommodate 725 passengers, and some hammocks have been added to prevent the number of passengers from exceeding the limit. When in Honolulu, supplies have been replenished to prepare for "any development". However, according to the United States President Lines, the number of passengers on the "Mariposa" will not be too crowded. There are currently 85 Americans in Shanghai who will depart on this ship, and less than 500 in Qinhuangdao and Incheon, Korea. It was also announced that the "Mariposa" will definitely not berth in Kobe, Japan. However, the destination of the ship after leaving Incheon has not been disclosed. When the "Mariposa" docked, the crew rushed ashore to sightsee, including Captain Meyer. It is said that he has not been to Shanghai for 18 years, and his appearance must have changed greatly. The "Mariposa" once sailed along the Chinese coast eight or nine years ago, but this is the first time it has come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Comfortable Cabins and Exquisite Cuisine</p>
<p>The "Mariposa" was built in 1932 and is a sister ship to the "Monterey" and "Manulani". It weighs 18,017 tons and travels at a speed of 20 nautical miles per hour. For the past seven years, it has been traveling between San Francisco and Melbourne. The entire ship is painted white and is one of the most beautiful ships on the water. Its comfortable cabins and exquisite cuisine are well-known throughout the world.</p>
<p>Washington Ship's Voyage to Shanghai</p>
<p>The third evacuation ship, the "Washington", is scheduled to arrive in port on the 17th of this month. The ship is huge and can accommodate more than 1,500 passengers. It has a large number of third-class cabins and extra small beds, and the ticket price is only about 100 US dollars. Therefore, the number of people reserving cabins on the ship from the United States President Lines has been constant in recent days. According to a reporter from the New Life News Agency, more than 400 people will be leaving Shanghai on this ship. The ship will stay here for four days and is scheduled to set sail for the United States on the 21st. According to the US registration, there are more than 4,000 people to be evacuated. As of today, 1,000 people have left Shanghai, and another 1,000 people have decided to evacuate within the year, who will take the various ships of the United States President Lines.</p>
<h3>Jinshanwei Guerrilla Fights with Japanese Troops; Villagers Wounded by Bullets; Family Sends to Shanghai for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Tang Kaiming, a native of Songjiang, is 21 years old and lives in a certain building in Zhujing Shuiputang East, Jinshanwei. A few days ago (the 5th), there was a guerrilla fight with the Japanese army in that area. Both sides opened fire. Tang Kaiming happened to be passing by and was wounded in the left arm by a stray bullet. Later, because traffic in that area was blocked, he could not seek medical treatment. It was not until the day before yesterday that his family managed to escort him to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai at around 8:00 PM last night and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Establishes Immigration Bureau; Travelers Fear Restrictions; Rush to Take Ships</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Hong Kong government, in view of the overpopulation of the local area, wants to restrict travelers from going there and has decided to set up an immigration bureau on the first of next month to handle immigration entry procedures and implement restrictions on travelers to Hong Kong. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency recently inquired about this with travel agencies. Travelers from this port who want to go to Hong Kong are afraid that the procedures will inevitably be more complicated after the Hong Kong government announces these restrictions, so many are going to Hong Kong in advance. Therefore, recently, many travelers have been buying tickets to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has now notified the local travel industry that anyone traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong, regardless of class, must hold a Municipal Council smallpox certificate and an epidemic prevention certificate issued six days before leaving Shanghai, and the certificate must be affixed with a two-and-a-half-inch photo of the person to be valid. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to disembark. It is heard that the British Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's ships to Hong Kong, the "Mingsheng" scheduled for tomorrow and the "Yusheng" scheduled for the 16th of this month, will be more popular with passengers than before.</p>
<h3>Cargo to Southwest China Transported Via Shayuchong</h3>
<p>Since the Shayuchong line in Hong Kong was opened, many commercial goods transported from this port to various parts of Southwest China have been routed through this line and imported through Shaoguan, which is very convenient. Recently, cargo transportation between Shanghai and Hong Kong has become increasingly crowded. The Qiacheng Shipping Company on Avenue Joffre has rented the American Qiapao "Pluto" ship to join the route, specializing in carrying goods, with a load of more than 5,000 tons. It is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 14th. Recently, several batches of local products from Southwest China will be exported from Hong Kong via Shayuchong and loaded onto ships for transportation to Shanghai. The company's joint transportation arrangement is about to be completed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Concert</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold its sixth symphony concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM this Sunday. The program includes three items.</p>
<h3>Local Observer Talks About Soviet Union Maintaining Neutrality and Deciding Not to Be Enemy of the British and American Front; Soviet Foreign Minister's Visit to Germany Influences Small Countries</h3>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Germany, a local observer said that the Soviet Union maintains traditional interests in the Balkans and the Near East, and the Black Sea and the Dardanelles are the keys to the southern gate of Soviet Russia. The flames of Western Europe are gradually moving eastward, which has made the Soviet Union feel uneasy. Molotov's visit to Berlin is aimed at discussing with Germany the division of the sphere of influence in Eastern Europe in order to protect the interests of the Soviet Union by means of compromise. This trip has a major relationship with the future status of the Near East countries, especially Turkey. The Soviet Union will not abandon its policy of peace and neutrality for the time being, and will not join the Axis powers to jointly deal with the British and American front. However, if the Soviet-German negotiations are coordinated, it will affect the attitude of the small countries in Eastern Europe. It is indeed a difficult task for Britain to deal with Germany and Italy alone in the Balkans.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Dominated by Rumors; Fierce Price Increase Yesterday; Authorities Unable to Control and Closed the Market Early; Responsible Parties Should Not Turn a Blind Eye</h3>
<p>The rice market has been active in recent days due to investment molecules, resulting in an increase in the price per stone. Yesterday, it continued to rise by about two yuan. The price of rice in the past four days has risen by as much as six yuan per stone. The Market Management Committee was unable to control it and finally closed the market early at 11:00 AM. If measures are not taken to suppress it urgently, the price increase will develop into the unrestricted price increase of last month.</p>
<p>Obvious Crimes</p>
<p>Since the source of domestic rice in this city has been slightly restricted, foreign rice has been ordered from overseas producing areas, resulting in the rise and fall of the selling price in this city, which depends on the quantity of foreign rice. Since the situation in Vietnam changed, speculators have taken advantage of various reasons to raise rice prices. However, the source of foreign rice has not only not been blocked, but is very abundant. The goods arriving in the past two weeks have been more than 400,000 bags, and the inventory is very sufficient. Some transportation merchants, taking advantage of the opportunity of the decline in gold prices and the long exchange rate, have ordered from the producing areas, also in the amount of hundreds of thousands of bags. Furthermore, after the Shanghai Citizens Food Regulation Association promoted group ordering, all sectors responded and participated. Therefore, the future of food for the citizens of this city is very optimistic, and there is no danger of shortage. Now, due to the manipulation of speculators and the hoarding of households, who refuse to let go, the rice market, which was slightly stable, has become tense again due to the price increase. The crime of stirring up trouble should be forcibly suppressed by the concession authorities, and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Taking the Opportunity to Spread Rumors</p>
<p>Recently, speculators have been spreading rumors in the market, saying that if the Japanese army's southward policy is successful one day, it will be difficult to purchase rice in the future. Some firms have rushed to absorb a large amount of rice, resulting in falling into the trap of speculators, giving them the opportunity to hoard and raise prices, making the entire rice market chaotic. Although the Japanese army has the intention of advancing south, there is currently no impediment to the transportation of foreign rice to Shanghai. Because the Nanyang area produces three crops a year, if this huge amount of production is not sold to foreign markets, the entire economy of the country will be greatly affected. And now the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is smooth, and the transportation of foreign rice is also more convenient than before. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason for the continuous rise in prices. It is heard that the Rice and Grain Evaluation Association is deeply afraid of exceeding the 5% profit stipulated by the authorities, which will disrupt the rice market. Therefore, they have been exchanging opinions for several days and plan to convene a meeting immediately to discuss suppression methods. The authorities are also paying close attention to this and will jointly suppress the rice price with the rice industry groups when necessary.</p>
<p>Group Purchase Should Be Expedited</p>
<p>Regarding the citizens' initiative to organize group purchases of foreign rice, the authorities have repeatedly advocated it, and reporters have also repeatedly stated that the citizens' automatic purchase of rice is related to the future of the entire food supply in Shanghai. Although many parties have already launched the initiative, most are still watching and waiting, missing the good opportunity. Now the price of rice is frequently increasing, and the livelihood of the common people will inevitably suffer a serious blow. However, the rice merchants' excuses are ultimately that the rice reserves are not abundant, and the domestic and foreign sources are not abundant, so people's minds are firm and rice prices have rebounded to a peak. The relevant parties hope that all sectors will quickly initiate or participate in group purchases of foreign rice, and no longer miss the good opportunity, jointly seek to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai, and relieve the suffering of the common people. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association's first group purchase of rice, with the price tentatively set at 75 yuan per bag, has already begun.</p>
<h3>Tonghe Debt Problem Resolved; Settlement Plan Signed</h3>
<p>The debt problem of the commercial department of Tonghe Commercial Savings Bank was resolved by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convening the third conciliation of all creditors the day before yesterday. As a result, a settlement was reached. The bank will raise 20% in cash. 10% will be repaid within one month after the settlement is reached, and the remaining 10% will be repaid in full by the end of this year's lunar calendar. The settlement plan has been signed by the five representatives publicly elected by all creditors yesterday. The plan, in addition to being kept by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the creditors, will also be sent to the First Special District Local Court of the Public Concession for record.</p>
<h3>Former Site of Central Bank; Leased by Municipal Council; Although Lease Has Been Terminated, It Has Not Been Returned to the Owner; Central Bank Has No Expression Since Being Occupied</h3>
<p>The former site of the Central Bank at the corner of Jiujiang Road and the Bund was leased by the Municipal Council to open a school after the war because the head office of the Central Bank moved inland and the Shanghai branch moved to Yiyuan to work. The Municipal Council's Nie Zhongcheng School, etc., have moved to Daxilu for classes. Although the former site of the Central Bank was declared to be vacated three months ago in accordance with the lease agreement, it has been "occupied" before the site was returned to the owner. It is heard that the Central Bank has no expression even though the site has been occupied because the former site was leased by the Municipal Council and has not been returned to the owner.</p>

<h3>Bullets Flying on Chongqing Road; Police Bravely Chase Thieves; Chinese Police Wounded but Still Pursue; Result: One Thief Killed and One Pedestrian Wounded; Yuanfengchang Rice Shop Looted by Bandits Yesterday</h3>
<p>A major robbery occurred in broad daylight at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Pellerin in the French Concession yesterday afternoon. There was a great fight between bandits and police. When the police chased to Dagu Road, one thief was shot and killed on the spot. One policeman was also injured. The details are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Shop Employees Settling Accounts at Noon</p>
<p>The second floor of the Shengtaichang Leather Goods and Tailor Shop at No. 7 Avenue Foch and Rue Pellerin in the French Concession is rented to Wang Baochu from Luodian. His family lives in the pavilion room, and the entire building is used as the Yuanfengchang Rice Shop, employing accountants, runners, etc. Wang Baochu himself usually goes to the Qingliange Rice Market on Simalu every morning to buy and sell. At 12:05 PM yesterday, employee Liu Senlin and two others returned from the market first. Before long, Wang also returned home in his own chartered car for lunch. At that time, the employees were busy settling their accounts, totaling more than 1,800 yuan in cash and a check for 700 yuan in national currency. Part of the money was placed on the table, and a small amount remained in their pockets.</p>
<p>Seven Bandits Armed and Entered</p>
<p>When the carter A Er (from Jiangbei) parked the car, he carried a sample bag and entered the kitchen to eat. Unexpectedly, seven bandits followed behind, each holding a pistol. Three were stationed in the shop of Shengtaichang Leather Shop on the lower floor, one guarded the side of the handrail, one pointed a gun at the hostess and maid in the kitchen, forbidding them to make a sound, and the remaining two bandits forced the carter A Yi to lead them upstairs, directly into the accounting room in the front building, pulled out guns, and one of them spoke in a Jiangbei accent, saying, "Boss Wang, we have been waiting for a long time. Please help us today." They first put all the cash on the table into their pockets, and then washed away all the accounts from the employees.</p>
<p>Carter Escapes and Reports to the Police</p>
<p>At that time, the carter saw that the two bandits were busy looting, so he took the opportunity to escape, opened the sunning platform door, turned over and entered the sunning platform of a coal ball shop at No. 9, and ran out through the back door, secretly reporting to Zhu Denglu, a police officer of the Daodeli police station, and telegraphed to the Songshan Road police station. Because it was close by, armed Chinese and Western detectives were immediately dispatched and drove in police cars. However, the thieves had already left with the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Chinese Police Shot; Injured and Pursued Tightly</p>
<p>The bandits fled westward along Avenue Foch without a trace. One bandit was about to escape from the main entrance and turned into Rue Luzon. The employees shouted "Robber" at the window, and a Vietnamese police officer at No. 198 at the corner of the Yimiao Street drew his gun when he heard the alarm. The bandit, in order to strike first, raised his pistol and aimed at the police officer. The police officer quickly dodged. The bandit did not have time to fire and fled northward. The Vietnamese police officer also followed closely. Both sides opened fire several times along Rue Edouard VII, but none of them hit. At the intersection of Chongqing Road, the Chinese police officer No. 3349 of the Chengdu Road police station, who was directing traffic, saw the bandit running over and planned to arrest him. The bandit immediately fired a shot at the police officer, hitting the police officer in the lower abdomen. The bullet did not penetrate. Although the police officer was shot and injured, he still bravely joined the Vietnamese police officer No. 198 and pursued closely. When the bandit ran north through Chongqing Road and turned east into Dagu Road,</p>
<p>Gunfire Flying; One Thief Shot Dead</p>
<p>The Chinese and Vietnamese police officers who followed fired five shots at him, and the bandit also returned fire to resist arrest. The sound of gunfire was like throwing a firecracker. On the spot, a stray bullet wounded a pedestrian, Song Xie (30 years old), in the right foot. The Chinese police officer No. 3349 who was chasing ran to No. 214 Wu Lao Jian Tou Shop on Dagu Road, was shot and injured, and collapsed. Fresh blood flowed out. The bandit fled to the front of No. 187 Tai Ji Cigarette Paper Shop on the west side of the Xinmalis Vegetable Market, and also fell to the ground after being shot. One shot hit the chest and one hit the leg. The injuries were too serious and he died on the spot. The bandit wore a dark camel wool robe, a black long gown on the outside, a blue cloth shirt and pants, yellow socks, and black running shoes. He was 25 or 26 years old. Half an hour after his death, his body was transported to the autopsy site in a hearse. The injured Chinese police officer No. 3349 was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment by ambulance. It is said that the bullet hit a vital point and his life was in danger. The injured woman was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Zhonghui Building; Two Thieves Arrested</h3>
<p>The Zhonghui Building at No. 420 Avenue Edouard VII in the French Concession is the residence of Tang Hesheng. At about 4:00 PM yesterday, four bandits suddenly broke in and robbed 370 yuan in French currency. When the bandits were committing the robbery, the French police station received a report and sent a large number of detectives to the scene, surrounding the Zhonghui Building on all sides. After a while, the bandits were called to carry the stolen goods out. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest them, but the four thieves saw a large number of detectives and fled. The police chased closely to the vicinity of Mugia Circle in the Public Concession and arrested two thieves, seized a pistol, six bullets, and part of the stolen money, and took them to the police station for handling.</p>
<p>Foreign Apartment; Bandits Rob Gun</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday, two bandits broke into Apartment No. 28, No. 182 Rue Amiral Bayle and Rue Magy in the French Concession to commit a robbery. At that time, the American Li Lai (the slot machine king), who lived in that apartment, was out, and only one servant was inside. The bandits immediately took out guns to threaten him and robbed a gold watch, a personal pistol, six bullets, worth more than 1,000 yuan, and left with the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>British Overseas Nationals Association; Lottery Drawn Last Night</h3>
<p>The British Overseas Nationals Association in this port recently organized a lottery initiated by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mash. There were a total of 55,000 tickets, each costing 5 yuan, and all the proceeds were donated to the national war effort. The prizes were donated by major foreign firms in this port, including a 1940 Chevrolet and Austin car, piano, radio, camera, clock, gold ocean, silver cup, woodware, clothing, books, cigarettes, wine, and food, etc. The total value of the prizes was about 100,000 yuan.

<h3>Collection of Crimes; Taking a Cut and Gambling</h3>
<p>Room No. 202 of the Meilongzhen Hotel at No. 5 Lane 6 Pingwang Street has recently been used to open a gambling den and profit from taking a cut. This was discovered by Zhou Zhenxing, a Chinese detective from the Old Gate Police Station, who went to arrest them at 11:30 PM last night. He arrested the boss Cao Xihou, gambler Lin Guoqing and 18 others, and seized a domino, gambling oceans, etc. Yesterday morning, he sent them to the First Special Court. The police station's lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Peng Qixin requested strict punishment in accordance with the law. After questioning by Judge Zhan Gence, Cao was sentenced to three months in prison, and the others were each fined 10 yuan. The gambling equipment was confiscated.</p>
<p>Private Possession of Military Weapons</p>
<p>The Public Security Force Reserve Team searched pedestrians at the intersection of Fujian Road and Beijing Road at 7:15 AM on the 9th and seized a box gun and three bullets from Yang Shenggen, a native of Wuxi. He was taken to the Old Gate Police Station, investigated by Chinese detective Xue Youwen, and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer Ru Baoyi requested to detain him for investigation. Judge Feng sentenced Yang to detention and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<p>Selling Opium</p>
<p>Zhang Zhitong, an opium trafficker from Wuxi, had a room at No. 238 of the Dadong Hotel at No. 6 Nanjing Road. On the 3rd of this month, Zhang obtained 16 and a half pounds of opium worth a lot of money and asked Ge Fengming from Wuxi to carry it with him, intending to send it to Suzhou River and take a boat to Wuxi. He was arrested at the entrance of the Wing On Company. Later, Hu Jilin, Zhang Zeshan, Ding Shun'an, Zhou Yi, and four others were arrested in Room No. 238 of the Dadong Hotel. Zhang was at large. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu rose to continue the interrogation. The defendants hired Wang Yaotang as their lawyer to defend them. Ge Fengming was sentenced to six months in prison for knowingly possessing opium. If he could commute the sentence to a fine, it would be three yuan per day. The remaining four people, Hu Jilin, etc., were each fined 100 yuan. The 139 taels, 4 mace, and 8 fen of opium were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Case of Thugs Intercepted on Avenue Dubail: Investigation Reveals Foiled Kidnapping Attempt; Three Thugs All From Fujian, Equipped with Military Caps and Bayonets; Second Attempt to Abduct Kong Xianfen Fails</h3>
<p>At 9:10 AM on the 9th of this month, a black-plated car, license number 5579, carrying three Taiwanese and two Chinese individuals, drove along Avenue Dubail at the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour. They were suddenly met by a search team from the Public Police, who approached to investigate. One of the Chinese men abruptly jumped out of the car, pulled out a pistol, and fled, leading to him being shot dead by Chinese and Western officers. Stray bullets injured several people. The remaining three Taiwanese and one Chinese individual, along with the car, were taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Details of the incident have already been reported. Further investigation by the police revealed that the so-called three Taiwanese were not from Taiwan but were actually Chinese from Fujian.</p>
<p>Knowing of Modest Wealth, Planning a Kidnapping</p>
<p>It was learned through interrogation that their names were Chen Jiabao, Lin Yueyan, and Jiang Jianben. The arrested Chinese man was named Gao Jinsheng, from Shaoxing, and the deceased was Chen Jinbiao, 22 years old, from Tongzhou, a well-known rogue in the Suzhou area. It was determined that they intended to kidnap Kong Xianfen. Kong worked at the National Goods Bank on Avenue Foch and lived at No. 6, Lane 75, on Rue Murmel. His movements were observed, and he always took a chartered car. Lu Ahua, who lived at No. 2, Lane 75, and Yang Qingshan (also known as A Qiao), a Henan man who sold fruit in the lane, learned that the Kong family was of modest means and conspired to provide information. Together with Gao Jinsheng, Chen Jinbiao, and others, they planned to kidnap Kong for ransom.</p>
<p>First Kidnapping Fails, Second Attempt</p>
<p>Using the fact that Chen Jiabao and the other two resembled Japanese, they wore military caps and impersonated Japanese soldiers. On August 21st of this year, when Kong Xianfen's chartered car left the lane, they attempted to kidnap him. However, Kong was alert, got out of the car, and fled. He encountered an Indian policeman on the way and shouted for help, managing to escape. The thugs drove away. This time, they discussed the matter again in room 22 of the Xi'an Hotel on Xi'an Road, planning to kidnap Kong again. Yang Qingshan was responsible for keeping watch. If he saw Kong leaving, he would signal by removing his hat. They rented car number 5579 from the Xinxing Automobile Company, owned by a Japanese person, at No. 170, Wusong Road, Hongkou.</p>
<p>Subject Alert, Fortunate Escape</p>
<p>Learning from the previous failed attempt, Kong was very cautious. Whenever he went out, he would get out of the car and walk, paying extra attention. When Kong walked out of the lane entrance the previous morning, he saw a suspicious car opposite him and turned around, heading north. Yang Qingshan, realizing the plan had failed, informed the thugs. They drove back towards Hongkou but were caught in a search at the intersection of Avenue Dubail, leading to the shooting incident. In addition to a pistol and four bullets found on the deceased Chen Jinbiao, a pistol and seven bullets were found near Chen Jiabao, and a military bayonet and two military caps were found near Jiang Jianben. Yang Qingshan was subsequently arrested, while Lu Ahua remains at large. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Gao, Chen, Lin, Jiang, and Yang to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above circumstances, requesting a postponement. Judge Fu ordered the five defendants to be detained, with a new hearing scheduled for the 22nd.</p>

<p>Strength of Both Teams</p>
<p>Today, Donghua and Lux are the two most elite iron armies in this season's A-League. Donghua defeated Jewish, conquered Western Police, defeated St. Francis, broke North Western Children's Home, and overwhelmingly won against the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce. With the convergence of wind and clouds, its prestige spread far and wide, becoming the only remaining Chinese iron chariot. Lux was originally a strong team, further strengthened by the heroes of St. Francis, North Western Children's Home, and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, effectively becoming a disguised Western United team. Therefore, today's Donghua-Lux battle is no less than a gathering of a Chinese team against a Western United team, with equal strength. It is yet unknown who will emerge victorious. On the Donghua side, the initial plan was to try its new formation, with Jia Youliang and Hong as forwards to strengthen the midfield line. Fei Chunhua and Sun Lufang were to be assigned to take charge of the main formation, but due to the strength of the Lux army, it was decided to use the same lineup as in the previous day's battle against the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Precautions</p>
<p>Today, spectators who purchased tickets in advance, both five-yuan and two-yuan tickets, must enter through the Avenue Joffre gate. One-yuan tickets can be entered through the Rue West Adams entrance. Temporary ticket sales will be available at the respective counters mentioned above. However, in accordance with the regulations of the French Municipal Council, a donation tax of 10% must be collected on tickets: five-yuan tickets require five yuan five jiao, two-yuan tickets require two yuan two jiao, and one-yuan tickets require one yuan one jiao. Spectators must prepare sufficient small denominations to purchase tickets, as we regret that we cannot provide change. Western Football Club gift tickets will not be valid today. However, those who enter the stadium must still present the pale yellow special pass issued by the club.</p>

<h3>Rice Weevils Unabated, Food Difficult to Obtain; Hoarding Merchants Are Powerful and Wealthy... Appeals Fall on Deaf Ears; Foreign Rice Arrives in Steady Streams... Rice Prices Rise Daily, Several Yuan per Day... Poor People Will Soon Be Driven to the Gutters</h3>
<p>The rise in rice prices in recent days is truly extraordinary. The existing stock does not decrease, and arrivals occur daily, but rice prices are recklessly raised. Various rumors have been repeatedly disproven with facts. However, facts remain facts, and rumors continue to spread. The manipulation of hoarding merchants still exerts its maximum power, all for the sake of other commodities, not "food items." Even for cloth, which is a "food item," it is ultimately not as crucial as genuine "food item"—rice. Because a piece of clothing can be worn for several years and can be mended when torn, even though cloth is as expensive as pre-war silk, it is still not as vital as rice, which is indispensable for daily survival and can be said to be controlled "in one's hands every day." Once it enters the stomach, hunger burns, and within a few hours, the stomach rumbles again, requiring new fuel in the form of porridge and rice. Therefore, the recent influx of capital is not being used in legitimate industry and commerce but in rice, which is essential for public survival. It is truly a case of borrowing a knife to kill, unafraid of bloodshed, seeking only personal enjoyment and disregarding the suffering of the masses. Now, look at the general rice merchants, all with high spirits, fat heads, and big brains, smoking cigars, drinking fine wine, and rejoicing at home. However, many are frowning and complaining about this, unable to eat their fill, drinking soup, and still unable to cope. The rice market has reached this point, partly because of inconsistent principles, but also because of speculative hoarding merchants seeking unattainable gains. The so-called "rule," "wartime," and "famine" cause others to grieve, while rice merchants and hoarding merchants are delighted. Without these situations, hoarding merchants cannot manipulate, spread rumors, or profit from troubled waters. Moreover, such rice prices cannot be achieved without wealth and power. When discussing price stabilization, appeals are met with deaf ears and no effect. Black-hearted rice merchants are still crying about losses. This so-called loss must be based on the rice price having once reached over eighty yuan, believing that it must return to that level. However, it is not known that Saigon No. 1 has already reached seventy-one yuan, and new japonica rice in its original bag has reached a high price of ninety-one yuan. In this case, according to the psychology of rice merchants, rice prices will inevitably rise daily in the future. I also think it will be a loss. Is there any reason for this? In short, if rice weevils are not eliminated, the people will continue to face difficulties in obtaining food.</p>
<p>The actions of hoarding merchants are so ruthless. However, looking at foreign rice, it continues to arrive daily without fail. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang wheel, carrying 5,456 bags from Hong Kong, arrived last Saturday evening and docked at its own pier in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson had two ships arriving in Shanghai, transporting foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Mingsheng wheel carried 3,285 bags, and the Sun Transporter carried 200 bags. However, the original ship will transport 1,340 bags of foreign rice to Qingdao today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice in the market soared, with each grade rising consistently. No. 1 West was at 72 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it still tried to rally and refused to sell. Rumors spread in the market, and people were confused. Hoarding merchants used floating capital to absorb rice, causing the market price to rise higher and higher. Spot No. 1 Yinghua Si has been quoted at 80 yuan, December No. 1 at 78.5 yuan, and No. 2 at 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan, and they are not willing to sell as much as possible. Even borrowing the occupation of a building on the Bund, and being confused by rumors about legal tender, and then encountering the contraction of exchange rates and rising gold prices, the price was set higher, which is no less than adding fuel to the fire, raising eyebrows and boosting the spirits of the hoarding merchants. Therefore, the early market opening price rose steadily. Now foreign rice has risen by nearly two yuan in the morning and nearly one yuan more in the afternoon. No. 2 West was quoted at 68.7 yuan in the afternoon, which is nearly three yuan higher than on Saturday. The daily transaction was more than 7,000 bags due to the facilitation of hoarding merchants.</p>
<p>The arrival of new japonica rice, premium rice, and wild tea rice is still not strong, with only one or two thousand bags in total. The retail and wholesale market is still desolate. Therefore, the owners rallied and each price continued to rise by one or two yuan. The original bag of new japonica rice was quoted at 91 yuan, 89 yuan, and 86 yuan in bulk. The green rice was 82 yuan and 80 yuan, the wild rice in the middle pass was 86.5 yuan, the original bag of Dujian was 79 yuan, and the bulk was 76.5 yuan and 75 yuan. The sheep rice was in short supply.</p>
<p>The stocks of both domestic and foreign glutinous rice are thinner than other goods, and suddenly there are large households absorbing them, as well as active sales of wine households and rice porters, which have suddenly become scarce goods, and the price has risen sharply by more than two yuan. Yili white is 80 yuan, Hong Kong ordinary white is 76 yuan, and Decision is 73 yuan. Glutinous tea is 65 yuan, and the price of glutinous tea accompanied by a decision is up to 62 yuan.</p>
<p>The rice market is closed today for Sun Yat-sen's birthday to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Flour and Noodle Hoarding Resumes</h3>
<p>The current flour market is gradually improving. The price of No. 2 flour factory is still 17 yuan, and the customer price is 18.5 yuan. In addition to nearly 10,000 bags of retail transactions in this street, customer sales are still not strong. However, hoarding households in this street, in view of the rising price of gold and rice, have resumed their speculative thoughts. Therefore, the old car flour price for returned goods is 19.2 yuan, and 300 bags have been collected from this street. Due to the lack of chips, it is difficult to buy more. It is also heard that the quoted price of foreign flour is also high, but because 600 bags of scheduled flour were loaded on the Taikoo Company's Suiyang wheel from Hong Kong last Saturday, both local and foreign customers are reluctant to buy. The market is still in a firm rejection.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions are also in a rejection situation. Since the arrival of goods from various places has been scarce, except for goods directly delivered to factories, there has been no formal sale. It is heard that the price of goods in the concession market is 27 yuan. Local merchants have purchased slightly, but the amount is not large. The Japanese factory is still collecting more than 200 bags at the original price. The market is in a dilemma for a while.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<h3>Soybean Hoarding Merchants Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybeans suddenly became prosperous in a tired state. The market price rose by 80 jiao to 1 yuan compared to last Saturday. The reason is that the rumors are fierce and the environment is good. In a short period of time, transactions have developed. No matter whether they are Hong Kong or local hoarding households, they have suddenly become active. A total of 1,500 to 1,600 bags of Qingdao soybeans were traded in the city, at a price of 35 yuan to 35.25 yuan. There were also 500 bags of Chen soybeans, at a price of 34.2 yuan. More than 2,000 bags of Tianjin soybeans, at a price of 37.5 yuan to 36.5 yuan. More than 100 bags of Anqing soybeans, at a price of 35.35 yuan. 60 bags of Pudong Xin Du soybeans, at a price of 38 yuan. More than 1,000 bags of Chongming sand yellow new soybeans, at a price of 33.5 yuan. 750 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong on the 12th.</p>
<p>Oilcakes and Oils</p>
<h3>Oil Price Soars by Two Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market experienced dramatic fluctuations in exchange rates, a surge in gold prices, and the spread of rumors, creating a favorable environment. Widespread buying activity led to continuous price increases, reversing the sluggishness of the previous weekend. Peanut oil prices uniformly rose by two dollars.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Speculation Stirs Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC posting rates at 9:30 AM, with British and American exchange rates tightening by 1.25 points each. The British gold rate was $3.6875, and the American exchange rate was $5.75. Other currencies such as Dutch, French, and Japanese also showed a uniform decrease. In the domestic market, there was a sudden tightening, mainly due to the absence of negative news, which led to speculative activity. The import demand in this area remained high, with foreign firms frequently settling accounts, and the general public following the trend to purchase, resulting in a tightening not seen in weeks. The afternoon closing price for the American exchange rate was $5.84375, while the evening result was $5.78125. Sterling fell to $3.703125, which was the closing price on Saturday, with British and American rates softening by $0.140625 and $0.328125, respectively.</p>
<p>Market Suddenly Tightens After Opening</p>
<p>Initially, the exchange rates between British and American currencies in Shanghai were flat, and there were no changes in the rates between American and British currencies. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of $3.84375 for British gold and $6 for the American exchange rate, which was flat for British and $0.03125 tighter for American compared to the previous Saturday's market closing. The market suddenly changed after opening, and a buying spree began soon after. Foreign firms first and Chinese firms then paid $5.9375 for American exchange for next month, and HSBC absorbed foreign banks' British gold at $3.8125 for this month. In less than half an hour, the tightening became more severe. Japanese banks bought British and sold American, purchasing spot sterling from American banks at $3.75 while selling spot American exchange to those banks at $5.84375, with the exchange rate remaining at 3.75. At 9:30, HSBC announced its rates, with both British and American exchange rates decreasing by 1.25 points. The British exchange rate was revised to $3.6875, and the American exchange rate was posted at $5.75. Other exchange rates, such as Dutch, French, and Japanese, uniformly tightened. Unexpectedly, speculators then followed the trend and bought aggressively, and short positions rushed to cover, leading to remarkably high prices. Some Chinese merchants sold this month's American exchange to foreign banks for $5.78125 and $5.84375. At noon, HSBC released foreign banks' spot American currency at $5.84375 as well. The situation stabilized before closing, with fewer buyers. The final spot prices were $3.6875 for British gold and $5.84375 for the American exchange rate, decreasing by $0.15625 each compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate Re-enters the $6 Territory</p>
<p>The market continued to tighten afterwards. Hong Kong telecommunications speculators bought aggressively, with Hong Kong telecommunications buying foreign banks' spot American currency at $5.8125, and speculators buying this month's American currency at $5.788125. The evening closing prices showed spot sterling softening to $3.703125, with spot and this month's British gold tightening by $0.140625 compared to the end of the previous week, and next month softening by $0.15625. Spot and this month's American exchange rate decreased by $0.328125, while next month tightened by $0.296875.</p>
<p>British and American Rates in Tianjin Both Decrease</p>
<p>Tianjin, 11th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened this morning with easing rates. The telegraphic transfer rates for London and New York both softened by $0.03125, with London at $3.84375 and New York at $6.03125. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by $0.375 to $0.90. "Joint currency" traded at a discount of $0.25, at $0.85.</p>
<h3>Short Covering Leads to Rally, Gold Rush Resumes, High Reaching $5,800</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for pure gold suddenly experienced a shocking surge, with the upward trend expanding rapidly. Amid the chaos, the price soared past the $5,600 and $5,700 levels, once even rising to the $5,800 mark, marking the largest increase since cash futures trading began. Reports that Soviet envoy Feder stated the "New Central Bank" would soon open further fueled the rumors. The dramatic tightening of foreign exchange rates stirred emotions across the board. The market initially surged by hundreds of dollars in a buying frenzy, reaching $5,690. Sellers attempted to resist, retreating to $5,655, but the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten, and exchange dealers and banks continued to pour in, causing short sellers to rush to cover, intensifying the upward trend. The price soared to the $5,800 mark. Around noon, a certain rumor arose, and the American exchange rate rebounded, causing a $60 drop. In the afternoon, the American dollar tightened again, and gold firms returned to buying, pushing the price near $5,800. However, the price dropped $65 due to money shops selling short and silver firms releasing gold. Ultimately, because of the upward sentiment, the closing price was $5,770, a sharp increase of $201. Over 6,000 taels were traded throughout the day. After closing, the price rose again to $5,790. Cash trading had not yet opened, and the price was slightly lower than futures trading by a few dollars. Decorative gold also increased by $20, reaching $590. Customs gold remained flat. The market is closed today for the birthday of the President.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Jumps $200</p>
<p>Initially, the foreign exchange market tightened, causing confusion at the opening. The price was raised to $5,690, an increase of over $120 compared to the closing price on the previous Saturday. At that time, bullish gold firms took the opportunity to lock in profits, and the price fell back by tens of dollars. Silver firms traded 20 taels at $5,655. Afterwards, as the foreign exchange rate continued to soften, sellers hesitated. Soon, silver firms traded 30 taels with money changers, exceeding the $700 mark, reaching $5,710. However, sales between gold firms pushed the price back down to within the $5,700 level. However, the tight foreign exchange market made it easy for prices to rise but difficult to fall. Silver and gold firms traded 20 taels, suddenly rising to $5,745. Although the downward trend was thwarted by silver firms releasing gold, the futures retail investors and other new longs rushed to buy, causing the price to jump to a high of $5,800. This was the case when gold firms released 20 taels to silver firms. Around noon, the foreign exchange rate eased slightly, and money changers released, while gold firms continued to sell. The noon closing price was $5,740. In the afternoon, gold firms entered silver firms with 10 taels at $5,760, and another 20 taels at $5,775. Meanwhile, silver firms released 20 taels to gold firms, falling slightly to $5,755. After fluctuating for a while, the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, and gold firms turned to buying again, reaching as high as $5,795. Finally, the money changers shorted, and the bullish silver firms released, dropping to $5,770. However, the money changers searched again in the evening, and the result was $5,770, an increase of $201 compared to the closing price on the previous Saturday. There was a fluctuation of $145 throughout the day. The current market price for cash gold from the cash firms was over $10 higher than pure gold, with purchase price lower by $30. The current standard gold was listed at $50 to $60 lower than listed gold, and trading was light.</p>
<p>Decorative Gold Also Increases by Two Grades</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold from silver firms increased by $10 at 9:30 AM, and another $10 at 11:30 AM, after which it remained unchanged. The Dadaong firm listed at $590. The new firms had similar prices, with purchase price approximately $30 lower.</p>
<h3>All Foreign Currencies Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various currencies were such that, due to the persistent rumors regarding the imminent establishment of the new "Central Bank," the price of pure gold rose sharply. The British and American gold pounds also uniformly increased by $3. British gold notes still saw little trading, and the market price remained stagnant. American gold notes initially rose to $16.90, but eventually settled at $16.85, an increase of $0.70 compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes followed the Shanghai exchange rate with a dramatic increase of $0.26. Canadian and Philippine notes also tended to strengthen. Demand for Japanese gold notes suddenly became strong, reaching as high as $1.54 in the evening market. Korean notes showed a slight upward trend, reaching $1.185 in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Increases by Half a Dollar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills initially rose and then eased slightly. The discount rate rose to $6.50 in the morning and $5.50 for purchases. In the afternoon, it eased slightly to $5 for purchases and $6 for discounts, an increase of $0.50 compared to the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was listed at 6% for both the morning and afternoon markets, with no changes.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Speculators Eagerly Buy, Yarn Market Surges, Double Horse Jumps $30</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with a particularly sharp upward trend. This was due to the abundance of rumors in the market, all indicating positive developments. At the same time, the tightening trend of foreign exchange rates and the soaring price of gold further excited the public, leading to intense buying. The market gradually advanced, but actual trading did not improve. The upward pressure was suppressed, but those outside the industry uniformly anticipated further gains. Today (12th) is the President's birthday, and the cotton yarn market is closed. 280 pieces of yarn were transported to Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with favorable international news, creating positive sentiment. Buyers flocked in, and the initial price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,265, an increase of over $10. Upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate was gradually decreasing, speculative buyers became even more eager, driving the price straight up to $1,282. Subsequently, a certain bank released a large quantity, causing the price to fall back to $1,271. However, the foreign exchange rate remained weak, and those who expected prices to rise were in the majority, pushing the price up again to $1,285. The closing price fell back slightly to $1,280. According to the statistics of transactions throughout the day, 6,440 bales were traded, with prices rising by $30. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 6,250 Hong Kong 190 Total 6,440</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Also Favorable</h3>
<p>The current situation in the cotton market is also favorable. Due to the dramatic tightening of foreign exchange rates and strong public sentiment, the market is trending higher. However, factory demand has been very active. Various sources remain difficult to access. Middling cotton is priced at $286 to $305, Pila flower cotton at $217, and Changyinsha cotton at $140.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton prices. The New York cotton market opened in the morning due to speculative buying. Later, due to favorable Wall Street stock prices and buying by overseas cotton merchants, the closing price rose by six to seven pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation was flat.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading. Yesterday, due to the sharp tightening of exchange rates, the combined cotton price rose sharply by over $10. The spot prices rose significantly as a result. Fellow traders were highly motivated, with some unwilling to release samples. Factories are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, there were no reports of large transactions yesterday.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Yarn and Thread Soar, Fabric Prices Surge</h3>
<p>The factory fabric market opened yesterday with a sharp increase, due to the soaring prices of yarn and money hoarders becoming eager to absorb goods. The asking price for coarse cloth increased by $0.15 to $0.50, fine cloth and fine twill increased by $0.50 to $0.75, bleached and dyed cloth increased by approximately $0.50, and poplin, fine wool, fine yarn goods, and greige fabric increased by $0.75 to $1.50. Over 1,000 pieces of various goods were traded on the street. The Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Shaoxing groups purchased over 300 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong groups purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. The northern Yantai group purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth. Strong buying activity from both within and outside the industry led to a dramatic increase in prices. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped $1.34 per piece, opening at $36 and gradually rising to $37.10. The closing price fell back slightly to $36.90. Four Gentlemen broadcloth increased sharply by over $0.05 per yard, starting at $1.10 and closing at $1.04. This was due to the strong positive atmosphere, which made the market very firm.</p>
<p>Exports. 315 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong on the 11th, and 35 pieces were also shipped to Hong Kong on the 12th.</p>
<h3>New Outlets for Plain Camel Wool</h3>
<p>Domestic wide and narrow camel wool used to make Russian hats and children's coats has seen its market sales plummet recently due to inconvenient transportation and a lack of transport routes. High prices and reduced purchasing power are also factors. Striped camel wool is even more stagnant, while plain and artistic styles are better. Artistic and plain camel wool have recently found a new outlet in making Russian hats and children's coats, broadening their market. However, this is limited to lower-end products, with a suitable price of over $2 to over $5 per yard. Children's and women's coats are mostly wholesaled at $130 per dozen, while Russian hats are mostly wholesaled at only $11 to $12 per dozen.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Floating Long Positions Released, Domestic Bonds Plunge</h3>
<p>The securities black market experienced a sudden downturn yesterday. Initially, it was due to the occupation of the Central Bank's former site. Subsequently, the surge in Yu Zi by $100 to $200 caused panic in the market. Floating long positions were released one after another, and the opening price dropped by approximately $1. Short sellers aggressively pressured the market, causing Class A bonds to break through the $70 level and Class D bonds to break through the $60 level. The situation was extremely dire. However, although there were many rumors, they were all unrealistic. Moreover, many short positions had been released, and there would inevitably be a short squeeze in the future. Furthermore, the general interest rate reduction by silver and money firms clearly indicated an unwillingness to absorb deposits, and various sources of funds still needed to find suitable destinations. It remains to be seen what will happen. Yesterday morning, Heng Kang, Heng Fu, and Lian He sold a considerable amount. At the time, Yu Xing and Chang Ji saw strong buying activity. Tong Shun and Xie Kang made some purchases, while Ren Chang and Le Mao continued to sell, causing the market price to become unsustainable. Retail investors also released a considerable amount. Class A bonds broke through $70, and Class D bonds, which had not been traded on the previous Saturday, dropped dramatically by $3 yesterday due to the removal of the draw rights, while the others fell by $1 to $2. Approximately one million dollars were traded in half a day. The market is closed this afternoon. Today is the President's birthday, and business is closed for the day. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Central China Trust Company were traded at a price of $13.10.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a sharp tightening of foreign exchange rates, with prices trending upward by over $2. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar were $75 at the local warehouse and $73.60 to $74.50 at foreign warehouses, an increase of $2.50. Taikoo Car B Mark was $75 to $75.50 at the western warehouse and $74.30 to $75 at the eastern warehouse, an increase of $1.35.

Several hundred bags of winter mist green sugar were also released, priced at $60.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<h3>Coking Coal Arrives from Dalian, Over 500 Tons</h3>
<p>The coking coal market has recently become sluggish, while the supply of train wheels remains constant. Over 500 tons of general coking coal arrived from Dalian yesterday. Various routes continue to see sales, but with declining interest from buyers, the market continues to trend downward. Transactions among fellow traders for general coal are priced at $145 per ton, screened coal at $160. For foreign warehouse train goods, an additional fee is added on top of the regular rate.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Black Tea Sales to Germany Revive, Silk Cocoons Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 11 pieces of silk fabric arrived from Wenzhou, and 20 pieces arrived from Hong Kong. In addition, 324 bales of silk cocoons were transported by ship from Wenzhou to port.</p>
<p>The local tea market has been particularly deserted in recent weeks. However, the sales of native black tea to Germany have recently revived. A total of over 500 boxes were purchased by firms such as Xingcheng and Jieshiman, priced at $280 to $290, with prices remaining firm. The green tea market remains stagnant. There is still demand for uncolored Fenmei pearl tea from abroad, especially for high-quality products. However, high-grade goods are rarely available due to supply disruptions. Sales of colored Zhenmei pearl tea are also stagnant. Furthermore, 285 pieces of tea were transported from Wenzhou yesterday (11th), and 100 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong today (12th).</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>The Depressed Market for Steel</h3>
<p>The market for steel has been somewhat sluggish recently, mainly because the supply routes from Tianjin are intermittently disrupted. Also, merchants from Yantai, Qingdao, and other regions have not been making many purchases. Furthermore, the actual sales of local factories are low, with only canneries and braising factories making some acquisitions. Otherwise, there is no activity, making the market feel particularly depressed and people feel listless. As a result, the standard prices have slightly loosened compared to before. For example, high-quality steel from old steel factories is now selling for $170 per 200-pound crate, while steel from new steel factories is selling for $165 per 200-pound crate. It is estimated that the actual transactions yesterday were around 100 crates.</p>

<h3>Jesus as Lord of My Heart (2)</h3>
<p>(2) Jesus – Lord of the Mind: The structure of our thoughts is also what Jesus wants to reconcile. Thought is an essential element in shaping character. The human thought mechanism does not emerge from nothing; it merely processes the material we put into it, using it to create our character, making us what we imagine ourselves to be. As the saying goes: "As a man thinks in his heart, so he is."</p>
<p>People sometimes casually say, "I can think whatever I like." But this is not accurate. Just as we cannot do whatever we want, neither can we think whatever we want. If I have malicious intentions towards someone, I will naturally treat them unfairly. Thought is the source of words and actions. What I think, I will say and do. Therefore, Jesus said, "For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander." (Matthew 15:19) People must first think of these things before they can carry them out.</p>
<p>If we regard Jesus as the Lord of our hearts with holy intentions, that is what Paul said: "We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ." (2 Corinthians 10:5) We listen for Jesus to control our minds, rejecting any thoughts that cause Him grief, and refusing to think about anything He does not want us to think about.</p>
<p>Conscious thought can also be cultivated, because a person's thoughts can be controlled by their willpower. We should learn the secret to controlling our thoughts. Even better is to allow Christ to control your thoughts in your inner consciousness. If He is the Lord of our minds, the peace of God will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7). In this way, we can think about what is honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good repute. Only those who honor Jesus as the Lord of their minds will know that thought is the greatest pleasure in life, because Jesus dwells in their hearts through faith, and they will set their minds on things above, rejoicing in all that is noble and beautiful.

<p>Free Debate: Where Should Women Go? (3)</p>
<h3>Women Should Return to the Home</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhai</p>
<p>(4) Women and the Nation: Since women are the "mothers of society," they are naturally also the "mothers of the nation." We all know that a small number of excellent people can rule a large population of a low-level ethnic group. From this, we can see how important it is to pay attention to the mental and physical environment of women in order to ensure that the nation has healthy citizens, so as to avoid becoming a subjugated country or a colony. China is now in the midst of a struggle, and it certainly needs the full strength of its 450 million people, but if we ask politicians to make weapons, medical experts to dig trenches, or engineers to run education, then even though we mobilize the entire population, the strength we gain will be zero. We must allow each type of person to exert their strengths in order to achieve the greatest power. Women are certainly no exception, and they should exert their strengths to cultivate healthy citizens, so that everyone can be in their proper place. President Chiang Kai-shek advises the young people in the isolated islands to work hard in their studies and not to go to the mainland. Is he嫌嫌人力太多或不要奮鬥了？。 He simply has superior insight. He knows that the current manpower and future manpower are equally important. If we only care about the present, using up all of our current strength without generating new strength, then when the time comes when there is no one to follow up, we will simply have to let others slaughter us. Therefore, women cultivating national construction to contribute to the long-term struggle or future restoration is also an important task for the current citizens.</p>
<p>(5) Women and Career: A career is a kind of work that benefits society, the nation, or the world. If a job can unleash the inherent abilities of the worker, it will definitely achieve solid results and benefit society and the nation. The key is a job that can adapt to physiological limitations and psychological influences. Women have a "maternal love ability," and according to Thorndike's tests, their sympathy, patience, and instincts for paying attention to people all exceed those of men, so they are very suitable for educating children. V. Sirtaunas said, "A good mother is better than a hundred teachers." In the biographies of great people, we can also see that great people become great people mostly because of the influence of their mothers. This is all created by women's special abilities. Therefore, if women engage in raising children, they will definitely achieve the highest results and the greatest achievements. Being able to cultivate a few great people to benefit society, the nation, and the world can truly be considered the most beneficial work and the greatest career. The key is that any work that is not subject to the control of dates, times, and locations, so that it does not affect the inherent functions of women, and that is beneficial to society and the nation, can also be regarded as women's second career.</p>
<h3>Women Should Go to Society</h3>
<p>— Yi Hui</p>
<p>(4) Women and the Nation: Women are members of the nation, and they have the same responsibility for the rise and fall of the country as men. Therefore, women's contribution to the country solely through their physiological function—producing small citizens—is not enough. They need to actively participate in all the work that creates a strong new China. The theory that "a small number of excellent people can rule a large population of a low-level ethnic group" is worthy of our discussion. A few imperialists are indeed in a superior position of oppression and exploitation against the majority of small and weak nations. However, what creates this superior situation is their inherent excellence, or the strength of their financial power and military might? If it is said that women should raise healthy citizens at home to prevent the country from becoming a colony, then is the reason why China has become a semi-colony to be blamed on women for not educating their children to become healthy citizens? However, for thousands of years, Chinese women have faithfully fulfilled their responsibility of raising children at home!</p>
<p>(5) Women and Career: An individual's choice of career should be based on their interests and talents. This is the case for men, and it is also the case for women. Some women have a special interest in children, and they are good at guiding children. This kind of talent should not only be their own child's nanny and teacher, but also the nanny and teacher of dozens or hundreds of children. She should not only educate her own children to become great people, but also educate many other people's children to become great people. A good mother can certainly be better than a hundred teachers. A good teacher can also replace a hundred or several hundred mothers who can raise but cannot teach. Because these women who regard child care as their career can constantly research and experiment to obtain the best methods of child care from their work. In this way, many other women can also pursue various careers that are beneficial to society according to their preferences, because there are child-rearing experts to raise their children for them. Since sympathy, patience, and attention to people are women's strengths, women should take on more leadership responsibilities in society. If the leaders of a country are all rich in sympathy and patience, then the happiness of the people will definitely be greatly increased. Why don't we use women's strengths to create greater happiness for mankind? (To be continued in the next issue)</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Zhao Baixiong's Confession</p>
<p>Hawthorne said lightly, "But he still sold you out."</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong smiled and said, "Yes, but he can't be blamed for that. Because I looked out of place staying outside the shop, I exchanged all my clothes with Nai Kui. His figure is similar to mine, and his attire is exactly the same, so it's naturally not easy to tell them apart. It was only after your detective partner followed him away that I was able to freely come here to visit you."</p>
<p>I seemed to have entered a dream state, and I was really confused. Zhao Baixiong was clearly a wanted criminal, how could he dare to come to the door himself and put on this hypocritical politeness? Even more strangely, how could Hawthorne treat him with courtesy? He had been looking for this person for a long time, so why didn't he arrest him immediately? Could I make a phone call to Ni Jinshou?</p>
<p>Hawthorne said coldly again, "Mr. Zhao, I must remind you. If you were more careful, you wouldn't say that you are a free man at this moment."</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong's body slightly lifted off the chair. "Mr. Hawthorne, what do you mean by that? Are you planning to —?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his hand and said, "Not that. You haven't been very free on your way here."</p>
<p>"What? Is someone watching me again?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe at least one person escorted you here. Would you like to meet him? ... Shi Gui, go to the door —"</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong hurriedly waved his hands and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, no need, no need. I really admire you, you are truly a detective genius. I think someone with your talent should take on more important tasks for the nation and the people."</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied with a stern face, "I don't think you came to see me at this moment just to say a few words of flattery to me, right?"</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong said, "Of course not. But you must understand that these few words of mine are really from the heart, and not hypocritical perfunctory remarks. I have two purposes for coming here: first, to apologize; second, to explain the misunderstanding." (163)</p>
<h3>Greed</h3>
<p>— White Dog</p>
<p>Greed only accumulates money, and reduces its effectiveness in all aspects. -- Taylor</p>
<p>One can fill a box with favors as easily as filling a heart with gold. -- Spencer</p>
<p>In the eyes of the greedy, the world is too small. -- Latin Proverb</p>
<p>The chests of the greedy are rich, but they themselves are not rich. -- English Proverb</p>
<p>Why are we so blind? What we accumulate, what we possess, and what we hoard, is it ever for ourselves? -- Madame de Stael</p>
<p>The life of a glutton is as if the world was created for him, not he for the world. He only knows how to take in, but not how to give out. The only convenience that the greedy person gives to his neighbor is to let them know that he is just as dissatisfied with what he has as they are. -- William Pitt</p>
<h3>The Giant's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Wei Min</p>
<p>—In Memory of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday—</p>
<p>Seventy-five years ago today, at the eastern end of the earth—on the land of our motherland, a child was born. Following the arrival of this child was the Republic of China; it was the overthrow of the Manchu Qing dynasty and the establishment of a democratic republic. However, this child worked like an ox and a horse all his life to save the nation from danger, and today, this savior of the nation has closed his eyes for fifteen years, but this democratic republic has not yet been fully established. However, the history we have written in blood over the past three years, this, the most glorious page of the national revolution, will be dedicated to our national giant, the national savior, Mr. Sun Yat-sen! —It will guarantee the completion of the arduous tasks left by our savior!</p>

<h3>Xin Yanqiu's Elegant Skill in Painting Orchids</h3>
<p>— A Visit</p>
<p>Performers' hobbies often involve a penchant for associating with refined arts. Through constant exposure, there are not a few among them who are skilled in calligraphy and painting. Occasionally, the wonderful works of performers are highly praised. For example, Shi Huibao's Wei stele style, Cheng Yanqiu's Zhang Menglong stele style, are bold and majestic, reminiscent of the Six Dynasties, even professional calligraphers would admit to being inferior. Some also use their artistic talents to create paintings, such as Mei Lanfang, Wang Yaoqing, Jiang Miaoxiang, Shang Xiaoyun, Liang Xiujuan, and Li Shifang's paintings of birds and flowers, Wang Fushan's butterflies, and Li Wanchun's Buddhist images, all of which are charming and considered rare and valuable. As for those who are by nature serene and do not seek fame for their paintings, yet their strokes are worthy of being passed down through generations, Xin Yanqiu's orchids are indeed commendable.</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu is skilled in painting orchids, with exposed roots and no soil, entirely emulating Zheng Sixiao. The ink blends with the mist, no less beautiful than Xiang orchids. Years ago, I saw someone write a poem for Wang Yuhua, "Ode to Painting Orchids," which said, "The girl painting orchids is only eleven years old, with hair hanging down to her eyebrows, dark as lacquer. Her eyebrows are like willow leaves, her smile bright, combining two beauties in one. In the song, she sings two tunes. She is from an old family that moved from Wuxia back to the capital, playing the pipa in a house with loquat trees. Her orchid heart is naturally a forget-sorrow herb, her blushing face a naturally smiling flower. An old man in the capital has long been decadent, seeking fame to visit her boudoir. The troupe originally had many talented branches, and her cloud-like hair also learns to sing courtyard flowers. Not long after returning, the south wind carries news that peace negotiations will be completed and the dark clouds will disappear. Four hundred thousand people are simultaneously disarming, and the imperial city is filled with rumors of war. As they come and go, the people tremble, and they must cross by boat. … On the seventh day, the Southern army entered the Forbidden City, and the bamboo cane in the corner points to a distant private residence. During these seven days, everything is desolate, and singing and dancing cease. Yuhua stays at home with her mother, and her ten fingers produce fragrant orchids. You have been learning to paint orchids for just over a month, and your skill is equal to three years of work. The peach blossom blood is similar in red, but the willow leaf eyebrows are not as green. Apply fragrant paintings to sandalwood fans, and their value doubles upon entering the market. The people of Chu give fragrant herbs to beautiful women, how could they lightly let the fragrant fan fall? Alas! Old Su Shi used orchids to compare to beauties, and beauties in turn write portraits for orchids. She is transcendentally different from the world, like a fairy, and her royal fragrance is herself. She can support her mother in the chaotic Beijing, and can perform the Rainbow Skirt Dance in peaceful times. The exposed roots entirely emulate Zheng Sixiao's flowers, born in the Six Kingdoms, how could she have soil! Don't you see that my poem should be included in the national history supplement, not just talking about love for children, painting orchids is also a person escaping Qin, the color is Qin and Chu. Stop singing the Southeast peacock flies, stop singing the Latter Lord phoenix song… " The new performer is an advanced female performer, who had the title of chairperson of female performers in her early years. The poem describes another piece of history. She has faced frequent setbacks in recent years, and many people pity her fate. When [Ran Du] came to Shanghai this time and reread this poem, with her orchid heart and jade quality, she may feel overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and present.</p>
<h3>Wang Yin Directs "Thinking About It"</h3>
<p>— Silver</p>
<p>Wang Yin has risen from film actor to director, achieving good results. His recent film "Country Girl" was very popular, further establishing his position as a director.</p>
<p>It was rumored that Wang Yin would direct the costume drama "Spring Lantern Riddles" after "Country Girl," but this is not entirely true. Wang Yin is currently working on "Thinking About It," which is a stage play recently completed by Cao Yu. Guolian Film Company is adapting it for the screen as a modern drama, a comedy full of satirical meaning. Yuan Meiyun is the female lead, and Wang Yin himself does not act in it.</p>
<p>The plan for Wang Yin to direct "Spring Lantern Riddles" does exist, but the script has not yet been adapted, so he is filming "Thinking About It" first. "Spring Lantern Riddles" was originally a play by Mei Lanfang, and it is now being adapted into a film based on the Peking opera. Wang Yin plans to prepare for "Spring Lantern Riddles" after completing "Thinking About It."</p>
<p>(1) Wang Xichun</p>
<p>Wang Xichun was formerly a singer in Nanjing, a typical figure from the "Qinhuai Family," but she was ambitious and knew how to cherish her artistic life. She did not belittle herself, and through diligent efforts, she transitioned from Qingchang (a cappella singing) to formally performing on stage. Her debut was at the Nanjing Grand Theater around 1936. Her initial partner was the laosheng (old male role) Zhao Yunsheng, and later Gao Baisui, who is now also with Carlton Theatre.</p>
<p>After the war, Xichun went to Hankou and collaborated with Zhao Ruquan and An Shuyuan at the Tiansheng Stage. I once saw her perform "Yutangchun" with Zhao Ruquan as the blue-robed [actor] and An Shuyuan as the red-robed [actor]. In a performance of "Farewell My Concubine," with Zhao Ruquan as Xiang Yu, just as Consort Yu was about to dance with her sword, an air raid siren went off, and all the lights in the theater went out. The performance resumed half an hour later. I think this was also a memorable day in Xichun's acting career!</p>
<p>I first met Xichun in Hankou. She lived in a lane behind the Tiansheng Stage, not far from the Railway Hotel. I don't remember the name of the lane. I visited her one afternoon. She came out to meet me wearing a simple floral qipao. She was very talkative and told me a lot about her singing in Nanjing and her apprenticeship in opera. She also talked about the Nanjing journalists and Tian Han. Tian Han was very supportive of her when he was in Nanjing. Before I left, she gave me a autographed photo. (See above picture)</p>
<p>In the summer of 1938, Xichun was invited by the Yifeng Drama Troupe to go from Hankou to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to Shanghai. She began to collaborate with Zhou Xinfang at the Carlton Theatre. She gained widespread praise shortly after her debut with the play "Consort Xiang's Regret." Later, she also appeared on the screen, starring in several films such as "Wen Sucheng," "Consort Xiang," and "Meng Lijun." She even became the owner of Chunming Film Company, which produced "Meng Lijun."</p>
<p>Xichun's acting is known for its subtlety. She is best suited for playing young girls who are just experiencing love. She has a nickname called "Little Crow," and she is still as innocent as a young girl. (Tomorrow: Sun Jinglu)</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on "Waterloo Bridge"</h3>
<p>— Shuang An</p>
<p>After the release of "Gone with the Wind," Vivien Leigh became extremely popular. Now she stars in "Waterloo Bridge," and audiences have been eagerly awaiting it. The male lead in "Waterloo Bridge" is Robert Taylor. The strangest thing is that when Robert Taylor went to England to film "A Yank at Oxford," Vivien Leigh played a seemingly unimportant supporting role and was not noticed.</p>
<p>Vivien Leigh's hard work is commendable. She worked continuously for twenty-three weeks on her role as Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone with the Wind," only resting for three days. It took her a full nine weeks to play Myra in "Waterloo Bridge," without a single day of rest. She would seize any free time on set to knit woolen items and donate them to soldiers in her country. She was also the vice president of a relief organization. During the filming of "Waterloo Bridge," she desperately ate chocolate to maintain her weight of 106 pounds. She ate it pound after pound, which amazed onlookers. It is said that her weight once reached 110 pounds.</p>
<p>The producer of "Waterloo Bridge" is Sidney Franklin. His previous masterpieces such as "The Good Earth," "The Life of Emile Zola," and "Mrs. Miniver" are all well-known and immortal works. The director is Mervyn LeRoy, who is also a top-notch master. "The Wizard of Oz" has already given us a profound and majestic impression. With such excellent talent behind the camera and such talented actors, how could this film not be a success?</p>
<p>Five months of preparation were spent before filming began, and seven weeks were spent on the initial storyboards alone. The so-called storyboards are to draw the necessary shots in advance as a reference for actual filming. This meticulous attitude is truly worthy of being emulated by those who are lagging behind in the eighth art.</p>
<h3>Autumn Mountain Waterfall Viewing</h3>
<p>Ms. Yang Shiyu is the niece and granddaughter of Yang Lingfu, a famous family in Wuxi and a female painter. She has a family background and also studied with Gu Qingyao in Wuzhong, learning landscape painting, which is extremely elegant. She has both talent and learning, reaching the highest level. The painting on the right is her recent work.</p>
<p>Lei Chuanxiao is the daughter of Lei Songfentang Lei Xuedao in Wuzhong. She once studied with Gu Qingyao, and her landscape painting style is extremely ancient and unrestrained. The picture on the right is her recent work.</p>
