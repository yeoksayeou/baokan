<p>香港　此間英軍事當局今日宣稱、日軍現正從事佔據與香港接壤之某某地區、以期肅清中國游擊隊日當局曾以此意通知英軍事當局、故無庸恐慌云、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>香港　日軍一批、今晨在廣東省南頭港登陸之後、突向深圳與香港交界處所推進據此間英軍發言入談稱、「近來中國游擊隊、極為活躍、頗使日方感覺不安日軍此次將毘鄰香港之若干據點、加以佔領、其意卽在肅清此項游繫隊、事前曾將此意通知英軍當局、是以居民無須為之驚慌云、（二十三哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>香港　估計日落時開抵香港邊界一帶之日軍、共有三千名現信尚有多名、繼續開至、同時日機竟日從事偵察、不時以炸彈擲繫各村莊、以防華軍抵抗、但其地華軍早已開走一空矣、觀察家現信日軍之行動、乃擬向英富局抗議准許軍需品經過緬甸公路運至重慶之先聲、目前之局勢、大類法屬越南之局勢、難民之越英邊界入境者逐漸增多（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>廣州　據華南日軍當局發表宣言謂、香港現仍以材料接濟重慶、日軍已在毘連九龍英國租借地之區域登陸以期「最後截斷此項路綫、」其原文如下、際此歐洲戰事正酣、香港仍以材料接濟重慶、意義殊為重大、日軍現已採取最後截斷此項路綫之行動」云、該宣言又發表日軍六隊、已於今日拂曉時、在毘連九龍英國租借地之寳安區域實行登陸、並稱日軍現正在英境以北之區域中前進、據英軍當局在香港發表之談話、則謂日軍現正進行佔領　、香港接壤之若干區域、以期肅清中國之游擊隊、並謂日軍已將此意通知英軍當局、故無庸驚惶云又據香港消息、日軍四百名、已在南頭登陸、循陸地進擾深圳、同時深圳曾遭日機兩架轟炸、死傷數人、難民現又開始越過香港邊境（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　法國對於供應品運過越南事向日本讓步、已使此間華方政界人士、深為煩惱、據稱華方有向法政府交涉可能、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>廣州　此間日方發言人頃論及所傳軍器經越南運往重慶事稱華南日軍當局近加調查、已悉滇越鐵路運輸之戰具的五千噸並有卡車的一百輛、每日從越南邊界運戰具往中國內地、此種不友好的國際關係狀態若果繼續存在我人不得不採適當手段使其終止（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>香港　今日此間一部分人士相信、日本軍事當局、或將立卽對英施行壓力、以封鎖緬甸與中國之通路、使不得以軍火運入中國內地、此輩人士以為、雖法國已尤許不以滇越鐵路輸運中國軍火、然緬甸之通路、並未堵塞、日本當局或將要求封鎖緬甸之通路焉、此輩人士並以為渠等之揣測因廣東日軍司令部之行動愈為可信、蓋廣州日軍曾以交戰國之態度對付法國、意若將不顧東京政府所締結之任何協定、此輩人士以為日本或將如去年八月所為、以對付香港為施用壓力之手段、據未曾證實而盛傳此間之消息稱、廣州之日軍、或將於數日內開向香港邊界、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>香港　日機多架、今日清晨開始轟炸香港迤北堡安附近之華軍陣地、八時左右日軍一隊、藉海空軍之掩護、在寳安強行登陸、旋向東進攻至正午時、日軍巳抵達寳安迤東五公里之白石地方、當日軍進犯寳安時、華軍奮力抵抗、卒以寡不敵衆、乃被迫東退、刻白石附近雙方正在激戰中、另有日軍一隊、今日拂曉在中英邊境之赤灣登陸、現正向東進犯、聞華方援軍已自淡水東進、預料日內將有激戰、（二十二日快訊社電）</p>
<p>香港　據此間日人方面消息、今晨日軍突進佔香港北部之寳安地、其目的在封鎖該區域、以阻止香港英商利用日軍不駐該地之機會從中取利也、日軍曾留駐堡安至去年十二月直至十二月三日、始由該地撤退、以滿足英富局之願望、並實行珠江局部開放、但香港英商利用寳安區域從中取利逐漸增加最近且變本加厲、故日軍當局對之於必要時不惜以武力干涉也（二十二日快訊社電）</p>

<h3 id="c4">宋子文氏赴美國 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>據馬尼拉電訊，中國宋子文氏飛赴美國，業經證實。宋氏此行，究竟負有何種使命？其活動對象是否不僅以經濟為範圍？各方皆在緘默之中，自非局外所得明悉。雖然，自有幾種顯著的基調，擺在世人面前，乃為人人所認識：其一，中國抗戰三年，以事實說明了國族精神的強健，潛力的渾厚，政策的正確而堅定，前途的光明；至於抗戰，其本身的意義，旣夙為國際所了解而同情，而國際形勢最近的極端幻變，尤見得抗戰之於世界大局實有莫大貢獻；故中國以及中國的抗戰，正在國際博得愈高的新估價。其二，國際強大的中立國，首推美國與蘇聯；美蘇兩國各有雄偉的實力，對太平洋皆有最痛切的利害關係，對遠東有鮮明的政策，對中日戰爭有公道的主張，對中國尤有最溫厚的　情；及至最近，蘇聯對歐戰不能不多所戒備，而美國則　進其遠東政策，更見具體化，正在發動各種明朗而有效的措施。其三，現代國際關係雖有複雜的多方面，但經濟因素實佔其間最高的比重；宋子文氏在中國財政金融界居重要地位，何況最高當局對他倚畀極深切，他在美國方面尤有優越的聲望信譽，從這三點，即使不事追求宋氏此行的眞　使命，亦得想像他所得貢獻於中美兩國富前的關係者，將如何微妙而重要。</p>
<p>國與國的外交，原由利害，感情，條約種種關係，交織而成；但別有兩種基礎，一是實力，一是誠意。實力是國家對外發揮意念與行動的有效後盾，所謂「弱國無外交」，應作如此解釋。固然弱國有時也可以利用外交來改善其地位，如往昔維也納會議中的法國代表塔里蘭，義大利建國時的執政者加富爾，皆善於運用外交；但這畢竟是收效一時的，後來法義兩國國際地位的蒸蒸日上，仍因國力的漸次充實。俾斯麥是大外交家，也被稱為「鐵血宰相」，鐵租血，就是俾斯麥外交的後盾。又如第一次歐戰後，法國的外交綱，也可算布得嚴密了，但到了現在，因武力的相形見絀，外交綱竟無補於災難。外交的另一要點是誠意，沒有誠意的國家，外交終必失敗。六十年來的日本外交，可算極活躍之能事；最初利用英日同盟，擊敗帝俄；繼又參加歐戰，坐收漁人之利；近年羽毛稍豐，便想遠交德國，近取遠東方面英美諸邦的權益。但看去年歐洲戰事爆發以前，日本想與德國締結軍事同盟而以不參預歐事為條件，這可以見的日本對德國，祇想利用而絕無誠意。因此現時英美蘇聯固然和日本對立，就是德國也能洞明日本外交的眞面目。日本外交於是目陷於孤立。</p>
<p>持以上的標準來衡量中國外交，顯然可以看出中國外交基礎之鞏固。中國自從發動對日抗戰以來，在外交土重要的直接收穫，已有：（一）民國二十六年八月中蘇互不侵犯條約之訂立；（二）英美對華的四决公開借款，就是民國二十七年十二月的美國貸款二千五百萬圓，英國貸款五十萬鎊，二十八年三月的央國貸款五百萬鎊，和今年三月的美國新貸款二千萬圓；（三）去年六月，中蘇又締結新商的，這是一個範圍頗廣而有利中國的條約。此外，各國對日本作各種方式的壓迫，是中國間接的成就。英美　，是和遠東有密切關係的三大強國，她們對於日本，無小立於尖銳對抗的地位，而獨注其友誼於中國，這固然由於她們的利害關係和中國完全一致，而中國民族之素來重信義，有誠意，也是一個重要關鍵。而且中國在戰爭中磨鍊了足足三年，在軍事上的地位日益增強，實力日益雄厚，儼然為亞洲大陸之　心，世界和平的柱石，其外交形勢，當然隨之強化。國際除日本，各國皆以與獨立自主的中國携手為得計，且在事實上也有此需要。中國居此重要的國際地位，更副之以其本身的誠意和實力之充沛，故中國外交前途光明，自小待煩言而可知。在這樣重要的時機，良好的條件之下，宋子文氏逕赴美國，此其具有重大意義，自必為各方所能體認。最近美總統羅斯福氏對於外交　策，頗能運用大刀闊斧的手腕，多所施為；素來強硬反侵略，且對於遠東情勢特別熟悉的共和黨領袖史汀生氏、亦擯除黨的畛域而與總統密切合作；所以宋子文氏抵美後的動能將如何，現在雖然無從預測，而圍繞他的環境之優越，洵屬小易多得。宋氏不是技巧的外交家，他以篤實誠懇著稱，這决飛美之能獲得賓貴和豐富的收穫，雖有待他的努力，但應該不是意外的事。</p>

<p>目前雖或有傘兵襲擊、及由空軍運輸之兵士企圖降落之虞、吾人對之、自應在空中及或被降落之後予以熱烈歡迎、惟目前之重大問題、即吾人今日能吾擊破希特勒之空中武器、吾人不能擁有至少與敵人相等之空軍、固甚可憫、但吾人已有甚強之空軍、在迄今所經歷之多决戰役中、證明在人材及許多飛機型式方面、品質均遠勝敵人、菩人在法境雖有甚大之不利、並在陸地飛機塲中損失飛機多架、但吾人與敵軍之損失比例、常為一與二至二·五之比、在鄧扣克戰事中、吾人無疑曾擊敗德空軍、並控制局部之空間、我方與敵人之損失為一與二至四之比、任何人曾閱及一週前所刊載之照片、見整批集合於海灘之軍隊可為敵人轟炸之最好目標者、當可明瞭此項撤兵登船之舉、苟非敵人巳放棄其恢復空中優勢之一切希望、必將不能實行、</p>
<p>就本島之保衛言、防守之利益將極偉大、吾人希望能對於鄧扣克曾經實現一與三至四之損失比例加以增進、此外吾方所有受傷飛機及其機員之安全降落、（在現代戰事中確有大批飛機及其機員安全降落）均將在本國之領土、故得生活以備他日之戰鬥、而所有受傷敵機及其機員等、則以戰事而言、自將成為完全之損失、</p>
<p>法境大戰時、吾人曾以戰鬥機與轟炸機予法國陸軍以甚有力之繼續不斷的援助、但吾人雖遇各種壓力、從未尤銷耗吾國內空軍戰鬥機之全部力量、此種決定誠可悲痛、但亦屬正當、因吾人縱傾其戰鬥機之全力、亦未能使法國戰爭之命運有切實之轉移也、法國戰事之失敗、旣由於不幸的軍略上之罅隙、亦由於敵方裝甲隊超越尋常而為人所不及料之威力、復由於德軍人數之衆多、若我戰鬥機隊全數加入、則易於力量消耗淨盡、而為此大戰中之尋常事耳、果爾則吾人將見吾人目前處於甚危險之境矣、余今可為下院欣然相吿者、吾人戰鬥機力量現與巳受重大損失之德方戰鬥機力量相較、視前為強、吾人空軍戰士定將有抵禦最猛烈空襲、以保全其鄉土之榮譽、其豐功偉績、吾人可預　焉、敵方轟炸機不久定將肆虐於吾國、故敵機轟炸之危險今仍存在、敵方機數誠多於吾方、然吾人亦有甚多轟炸機、將用以不間斷的攻擊德境內軍事目標、</p>
<p>余不忽視吾人當前試驗之嚴重、惟余信國人定能勉為其難、至少與世界任何其他人民相垺、前途如何多擊於此、吾國男女人人皆將有表現其民族最好品質、而竭其全力為國服務之機會、此時全國人民無論居何地位操何職業、負何責任皆須牢記「在永可紀念之幕上不留卑鄙行為」之名言、</p>
<p>余以為今日宜將吾人據以決定繼續作戰之切實理由、略為下院與國人言之、余可確吿者、吾人海陸空三部顧問專家皆一致以吾人應繼續作戰為言、並謂有最後勝利之良好與合理的希望、（衆歡呼）吾人亦獲有各海外自治地之完全信任、（衆歡呼）加拿大澳洲紐絲綸與南非首相皆有電致余、詞極懇切、贊成吾人之決議、並宣布與否人共禍福相終始之準備、</p>
<p>吾人現或自問、開戰以來吾人地位何以變劣、其所以變劣者、以德方佔領西歐海岸綫一大部份、而許多小國為德軍所摧毀也、空襲可能性乃因以愈增、而我海軍之工作亦因以愈多、惟吾人長距離封鎖之威力不因此而減弱、反因此而增強、今法國繼續抗戰與否尚未確定、不過其抗戰力量無論如何將大減弱耳、苟法國果停止抗戰、則德國將集中其兵力加諸吾人、惟依余所述之理由、德國雖欲為此、究非易事、如德國果因法國停戰而欲即侵入英境、則吾人無須駐大軍於法境、而可得更大而更有效率之兵力以迎之、</p>
<p>如希特勒能將其所征服的諸國之實業、置諸其強暴統制權下、則德方戰具出產將因此而大增、惟此事非可立即實現、而吾人則現可得美國方面大批軍火源源不斷之供給、而自治領與國外方面尤有飛機與飛行員之接濟、凡此因素、在冬季降臨以前、將有益於吾人、而德方則將感覺冬季之困苦、蓋歐洲全部幾皆憔悴呻吟於德軍鐵蹄之下、飢寒交迫鋌而走險、將大不利於德方也、</p>
<p>吾人有必不可忘者、自一九三九年九月三日吾人宣戰之時起、德國常有用其空軍及其他新式戰具攻擊英國之可能、而非法國所能阻其空襲、故在此數月中、吾人無日不在此危險中、惟吾人已將防務大加改良、並知吾人飛機與飛行員較敵方為優、故余以不存幻象之胸襟考慮空襲危險時、余固見極端審慎以防空襲之理由、但未見惶恐或悲觀之任何理由、</p>
<p>上决大戰四年、協約國在第一年所遭遇者、除禍患與失望外、殆無他物、勞合喬治君當能憶之、然協約軍之士氣、卒較屢獲侵略勝利之德軍為高、上决戰爭時、吾人曾常自問如何可獲勝利乎、當時無人能切實答之、然可怖的敵軍終倏然出人意外的崩潰於吾人之前矣、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>余尚未知法國將有何發展、亦不知法國將吾在其本國境內及在其海外領土繼續抗戰、吾人未能容許法政府解除其條約義務、如法政府不依照條約義務繼續作戰、則直放棄一大機會而委棄其前途、下院當已閱讀吾人願意在法國歷史中最黑暗時期締結共同人民的一種聯合之宜言、無論法國或其政府有何舉動、吾人在英倫三島及在英帝國決不喪失對於法國人民之友感、如吾人現須遭受法國人民所已遭受者、則吾人當仿其勇敢而超邁之、如最後勝利酬答吾人之勞、則法國人民將有以分其所獲而自由將還諸各方、</p>
<p>吾人對於正當要求不予裁減、捷克波蘭挪威荷蘭比利時之人民、曾與否人道同志合者、皆將復其舊狀、魏剛將軍所謂之法蘭西戰爭現已過去、余料不列顛戰爭行將開始、基督教文明之存亡擊於此戰、而英國自己生命與其憲法　帝國之存續亦於此是賴、</p>
<p>敵方全部在悍與能力勢必不久轉移於吾人、希特勒自知必在此島擊敗吾人、吾則失敗、如吾人能應付之、則全歐可自由、而世界生活可欣欣向榮、但若吾人失敗、則整個世界運美國與凡吾人所愛護者在內、將淪落於新黑暗時代之深淵中而此黑暗時代或將因科學之妄用、愈為兇酷而延長、是以吾人今當各盡其責、吾人當知在英帝國千載之後、說者猶將謂今日乃吾人最優良時期也云、</p>
<p>史密士代表工黨稱、今日國人贊助首相之一致、並稱吾人須堅持到底、自由黨海立斯發言、稱讚邱吉爾之勇敢言論與偉大領導、勞合喬治亦發言聲明未有追溯往事徒費光陰之意、但主張在星期四日舉行秘密會議時、應對於目前情形有甚坦直之討論、邱爾吉答稱、秘密會議時之辯論、各議員可自由發言、惟當以國防為討論之焦點云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c26">中歐的新興國　羅馬尼亞處於縫中 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>講到歐洲的戰略，羅馬尼亞及東南歐的重要，乃由於其能供給德國一個協約封鎖下的通道。德國賴以作戰的煤油，小麥，菜子及玉蜀黍，大量兒來自羅馬尼亞。</p>
<p>對於新有民族自信的東南歐人民，這問題比較簡單。他們看得很明白，目前的幾年，足以決定其生活形態及實質的全部。他們也曉得在這樣大事態的掌握中，他們無能為力的。他們所能做到的只有盡量避免德國及協約國的夾攻。</p>
<p>即使羅馬尼亞的命運不怎樣占　界的重要性，即使羅馬尼亞的石油與小麥無戰略上的重要，這新興國家的形勢也值我們加以注意。因為羅馬尼亞是站在十字路口；一個方向是偉大的前途，另一方向是走向極不重要的地位。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞國境內，從黑海到西境的脫錫伐尼亞，從喀吧阡山脈到多瑙河，差不多有一千萬耐勞的農民，這些人住在世界上最膏腴的地帶，可以與南俄的黑土地帶相比擬，而在這土下，有一天可以發現比現在歐洲已經知道的埋藏物還要豐富的礦藏。不論今日這一個國家的情形如何，在作戰中的歐洲，自然要對於這一事實加以注意。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞是世界最新的國家，所謂新的意義，乃是就共發展的階段而言。其民族是在語言習俗統一的過程中，其首都是自覺地在模仿巴，　着巴黎的俗氣而很少它的力量，其統治的辦法　　　去的，而不是現代的。羅馬尼亞比一切都要需要的，是時間，而時間恰巧是他們所不能控制的一個條件。</p>
<p>大戰的爆發，使羅馬尼亞駛入茫無邊際的中流。到了目前，已經過了八個月，羅馬尼亞的統治者唯一的希望，是把他們飄流的舟，駛入中立的避風港口。但戰爭的風暴愈吹愈緊，中立性的避風港口，比之八月以前，並沒有更進一步。現已有小吉的徵象，似乎駕舟的舟　，失去了堅定。　的國的戰略，應拿這些事實加以考慮。他們必然的道路是反對德國從相反的方面，發動另一尚樣勢力的暴風；如果協約國這樣做，他們明白，他們要把這寳貴船隻，在未抵港前，有沉沒的危險，並要使其裝載了的豐富貨物，在德國攫得以前，就沉沒下去。</p>
<p>沒有什麽事實再比羅馬尼亞的煤油生產消息可供這樣情形的說明。德國經　堅決的談判，已獲得羅國每年供給　。五〇〇〇·〇〇〇煤油的條約，這數量，除非德國工程師努力幾年，把東南歐的交通改進外，實際上似無法運去；德國的代理人關於收買若干石油讓與的控制權，巳極吿成功，這些人使羅馬尼亞曉得德國需要，超過羅馬尼亞所能交貨的數量以上。</p>
<p>我們目不能講，每一件事都要看羅馬尼亞統治者的勇氣與能力。至多我們可以講者，羅馬尼亞的軍隊，其軍官，比之五年以前已較優良，但還不得其應有優良的程度。羅王卡羅爾盡其全力改進他的軍官的　準，講到這地方，他又需要史多的時閒。如果羅馬尼亞的　奪達於軍事階段，那末只有較有力的參　國獲得最後發　權，　爭取如只限於外交及商業方面。</p>
<p>羅屬尼亞將有　不可　的勢力，而羅馬尼亞所努力的，也就是向這一方面進行。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞是被一個父系是德國王族而母系是蘇格蘭貴族的王統治着；他具有父母兩方的幾種特質。他是勇敢，固執，節儉，潑辣，忠實於他的野心，比之他的臣民要聰明，更其可以代表他的個性的，是不顧一切的精神。如果羅馬尼亞傾覆，卡羅爾及其王朝的全部希望也必隨着傾覆。</p>
<p>在卡羅爾的對內對外政策上，有一種顯著的類似。自從十年以前，他自巴黎乘飛機回國執政以來，他就不得不繼續與其指揮的政客陰謀策動，一直到九三八年以後，他才能當他自己是羅馬尼亞不成問題的統治者。</p>
<p>好多年來他就幹這樣巧妙的權力均衡政策，聯甲倒一，逐漸把重要人物排去，等到他可以指定人來輔政。</p>
<p>在對外政策上，卡羅爾也玩這樣勢力均衡的把戲。如果他幹這把戲成功很少，這是由於好多因素不是他所能控制。如果沒有戰事發生，他對於他的前途，就沒有什麽可恐懼理　存在。</p>
<p>他的　　　，是把政府中，參加了若干鐵衛團的團員。那些說這樣姿態是對付德國的人，實在誤會了卡羅爾的　機。在相反方面，這是更進一步地解除反對黨勢力的動作。自從鎮壓鐵衛團以來，羅京及各地的輿論巳暗中在表示疑懼，因為每一羅馬尼亞人，對於政治環境不斷的變更，受了很多痛苦，而對於宋來又極少希望。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞一九四〇年春天的情形是平靜，同時有些疑戄。軍隊大部份已經動員了，武器從德國義大利及協約國源源而來，而外交仍保持狡滑的　度。用着所得不會怎樣大，所失不會怎樣小的態度，羅馬尼亞的統洽者希望那些保留的態度，能夠演過戰事。無疑他們將盡量巧妙地利用這樣保留的態　，一直到不能利用為止。（譯紐約泰晤士報）</p>

<p>三曰勤學問以廣才。今世萬事紛紜，要之不外四端：曰軍事，曰吏事，曰餉事，曰文事而已，凡來此者，於此四端之中，各宜精習一事，習軍事，則講究戰攻防守地勢賊情等件；習吏事，則講究撫字催科聽訟　農等件；習餉　，則講究丁漕釐捐開源　流等件；習文事，則講究奏疏條教公牘書函等件。講考之法，不外學問二字。學於古，則多看書籍；學於今，則多覓榜樣。問於當局，則知其甘苦；問於旁觀，則知其效騐。勤習不已，才自廣而不覺矣。　四曰戒傲惰以正俗。余在軍日久，不識術數占騐，而頗能預知敗徵，大約將士有驕傲氣者必敗，有怠惰氣必敗。不獨將士然也，凡委員有傲氣者，亦必債事；有惰氣者，亦必獲咎，傲惰之所起者微，而積久遂成風俗。一人自是，將舉予聖自雄矣；一人晏起，將舉國俾畫作夜矣。今與諸君約，多做　事，少說大話。有勞不避，有功不矜，人人如此存心，則　業目此出，風俗自此正，人材亦自此盛矣。</p>

<p>昨日外幣币况、烚赤盤旋向上、英美金鎊跟隨上漲、英金票稍有需要、市價略漲、美金票始又曾降至十六元零八分、嗣傅某銀行將向黑市傾扒大量外滙、故市價急遽轉漲、一度高至十六元七角、午後又浪為十六元五角、但比上日仍好一角、香港票晨漲午後回平、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均回起二角、日金票需要略增、晚市為一元零九分、朝鮮票略洪為九角五分、</p>
<h3 id="c76">糧食　米價提得太足　仍有一元上落 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>米　自前轉平後、昨雖有一度變化、然查全市僅一元上落、不若昔之激盪、蓋因各價業經提足、一般作客對於門市頗感不易應付、且洋米來源、雖云海防等區運輸困難、而暹羅仍可通行無阻、况路貨絡繹於途、滬棧存底亦富、如此情形、市面豈能不斷高漲、故晨開無論賣買雙方、悉在觀望、不敢貿然吃進、當時交易旣鮮、形勢殊見懈淡、各色洋米價曾落一元、一號陳西貢祇售六十五元、小紋六十一元、不過經此低落、頓又引起本街店胃之暢辦、內地鄉莊客戶亦稍添購、而浮囤本抱欲擒故縱之計、茲見市色略一轉機、即復大事活動、相互扳抬、喊聲逐起、各價頓恢復原盤、此後賣方雖尚力圖喊高、但實銷一励即懈、而市面轉呈盤旋矣、及至下午獲利者競出、市乃始見盤低半元至近元、小紋米晚收祇開六十一元、銀行棧六十一元三角、回籠原包六十六元半、暹羅二號十八裝船早收七十元、下午小至六十八元、收價又高五角、二十六裝船亦開到六十八元、後未有續妥、二號西貢月初裝開六十八元、總計回籠貨二百五十噸、現貨開出七千五百包、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、續到一千餘包、傅聞塲外粳米暗盤、依然平平、與前相仿、而市上糯米銷塲較前轉稀，故雖貨主繼謀喊高、未能獲願、結果亦僅平平、售價悉無榮辱、金深特元仍開六十元零五角至六十元、常丹貨五十九元左右、江北白元五十七八元云、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市依然堅俏、每日供給實銷約計六千包之數、客銷則早巳無形限制、故回籠粉客、昨有十六元五角之高價、老車棧單亦須十四元五角、其間不無參差、華廠方面以今庚小麥已被統制、迄難疏通辦法、此後原料恐有不接、對於本街零銷、亦將有難乎為繼之勢、而日廠方面、則以採辦新麥稍有把握、竟有期貨預為拋出、</p>

<p>現棉完全杜絕、廠方因紗市疲乏、存棉充盈、足夠　待新棉上市之需要、所以終日無採辦之舉、至於同行、大都向海外購訂之棉、巳實足、目前亦少發展力量也、市上稍有交易、均係暗盤、因行盤之廉宜、不願宣佈也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、昨日呈疲乏之狀、因市上缺乏重要買戶、後因南方帮之套賣、結果收盤價格、近期漲一磅音遠期降落三四磅音、印度棉市昨日連同豫測跌二羅比、</p>

<p>此次紗業之慘敗、可稱空前、其倒閉淸理者、幾無日無之、此猶明而宜佈者巳達數十家、其有潛逃以不了了之、與及介於似倒非倒之騎牆式者、更不知多少、市價之直錢猛瀉、使從業者無喘氣之餘地、固一大原因、然而解鈴還是繫鈴人、曩昔之盲目高抬、不依正軌、種瓜得瓜、食報原不稍爽也、惟過去造成慘敗之原因、不妨作一探討、俾留殷鑒於將來、</p>
<p>（一）入會審查之不嚴格　同業入會例須作嚴格之審查、其非素業棉紗、更無入會資格、他如資本之規定等等、皆須實行調查、但執行者恒以交情為前提、更以會費為目的、來者不拒、因是造成良莠混雜之組合、會員激增、秩序欠佳、其間不乏存心不良、及作孤注一擲之流亞、於是掀風作浪、肆無忌憚、反動之來、安得不一敗塗地、</p>
<p>（二）倒帳處理之不公尤　凡對於同業事件、能秉公辦理、自不至傚尤蠭起、而無如反有徇情庇護、例如某號不自量力、而致週轉不靈、出而講倒帳、一二成及二三成了事者、（其實倒閉者逃避私蓄並非破產。）事後、該號仍能入會照常營業、有似「淴浴」、如此不講信用、於星狡者思逞、而倒閉不以為奇矣、</p>
<p>（三）左右市塲之操縱法　更為同業所不齒者、往往以自己營業之多空、有如五月份硬作結價之市價標準、與及以前假　部令而禁止期貨之通告、藉以左右市價、而飽私囊、更於在抬之時、任令一味盲從、不計利害、例如某紗二十支月琴牌（業中術語稱為皮球貨、意指逐鹿之目的物、）最高價抬至一千八百餘元、同時同樣貨身及比月琴牌貨身高者其價反撳小至五六百元、無理智之盲從、於此可覘一斑、及今反動之亦不依正軌、自亦有因也（月琴牌最近低價僅八百元左右、與高價竟小去千元、亦屬奇聞、）該會交易、原以國產棉紗為準、　間有經營某種紗者、大都偷偷摸摸、朱敢公然成交、及該會會址擴充後、竟以全部二樓、專　此種買賣、不收定洋、於是羣趨從之、經營者旣衆、而風浪亦大、存心不良者、　作購發財票、中則頭彩、不中則溜之大吉、因此反動之來、潛逃者夥、而轉輾牽涉、大都均蒙其害、無　維持、倒閉者遂若是其多、此外如　間人之絕不負實、及擅設字號、作轉帳揩油之機關等、亦與整個紗業有絕大之關保、業外人不察、誤入殼中、傾家蕩產者固不少也、（翔）</p>

<p>內地絲經來滬、據傳於七月起將徵收特捐百分之十二、計算每擔白廠須付六百元、土絲三百元、但聞該特捐名稱為「過份利得」、是故生絲來滬問題內幕並不簡單、即繳付過份利得「稅」後、生絲能來滬與否、尚不可知、蓋聞生絲出運還須有搬入證與搬入費等名目、故絲業來源出路均成問題、</p>

<h3 id="c91">英國的民族性 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>邱吉爾說，「法蘭西之戰已經過去，不列顛之戰行將發軔，深信不列顛帝國的男子婦女都能應付這一嚴重的試騐。每個人表現我們民族戰鬥力的機會已經到來。戰而勝，一切被征服的國家都要復興。戰而敗，全世界又將陷入黑暗時代。我們要振作精神，盡我們的責任，不列顛帝國如其綿延千載，人們將謂「這是一個最偉大的時期。」』</p>
<p>這是邱吉爾對英國人所發出的作戰口號。這一戰的勝負，在軍事上要決定英國的海軍與德國的空軍陸軍，究竟孰强；在政治上要決定此後領導歐洲的是民治，還是獨裁。歷史上拿破崙之戰又將重演，是否會再有滑鐵盧之役，一時不能分曉。</p>
<p>在一八〇六年，拿破崙的領域包括法，德，義，奧及波蘭的一大部份。他的海軍在特拉法加一役戰敗之後，他的陸軍尚能在歐陸保持十年之久，最後的勝負仍是英國的海軍力決定的。當時的拿破崙無需向海外覔求軍需接濟，現在的希特勒則小然，但是拿破崙並沒有希特勒的空軍，對於英倫三島自然英雄無用武之地。現在的情形就不同了。</p>
<p>英國人有一首家喻戶曉的詩云：</p>
<p>我們已往的一切昭告我們的未來；</p>
<p>莎士比亞之聲，納爾遜之手，</p>
<p>密爾頓之信仰，威至威士之重托</p>
<p>我們這天賦無桎梏的國，</p>
<p>天下人　鑒　：全世界縱與相抗</p>
<p>其奈英倫何。</p>
<p>這是英國人的信念，這信念是否還可不為時代的大潮所撼動，一時也小能有分曉。</p>
<p>講到這裏，英國的民族性，對於戰局的前途，自然具有重大影響，本刊茲將紐約泰晤十報的紀載迻譯如下：</p>
<p>聯軍節即敗退的一天晚上，紐約泰　士報通訊員，在倫敦的「報館街」上向一個老頭兒買報紙的時候，問他道：「今晚的消息怎樣」？那老報販回答說。。「我不知道呀，我是從來不看報紙的，因為我知道我們到底會打勝仗的。」</p>
<p>這是十足表現出了英國的民族性。他們在遇到困難的時候，始終樂觀。敲英國人的頭好像敲釘在地上，你越敲得重，他越見得穩固。</p>
<p>戰時最能表現一個國家的國民性。那個賣報老人並沒有什麽可異。</p>
<p>每决戰鬬的開始幾役，英國人望上去好像一個疲乏，而又過份自恃的老年體車拳擊家，但是經過了兩三决的蹣跚搖擺，這個拳擊家就把他奪取錦標的實力漸漸表現出來。</p>
<p>上决大戰巳證明英國人能忍受敵人非常的痛擊，而仍若無其事。他們已明示世人，當德軍直逼海峽，甚至英人饑饉交迫之時，猶能奮起回擊。英國人具有無限度的忍耐性，能侷處設備窳陋的戰壕中，奮勇而高興的作戰；現在他們仍舊具有當時體格上的勇氣。</p>
<p>挪威戰事發動之初，邱吉爾對英國百姓說，希特勒的侵犯斯干的那維亞，爲拿破侖出征西班牙以來最大的軍事上錯誤。三星期後，德國人把聯軍驅逐出北極圈，但是英國人當時旣沒有，現在還未曾表示灰心。</p>
<p>英國人這樣的擯除煩惱，使强大的力量和顯著的弱點同時產生。所謂力量也者，因為拒絕煩惱之故，英國人吃苦的能力及不怕戰敗，較世界任何民族為堅强，但同時也就是弱點，因為有時候他們把滿足之心和自信力混在一起，為了滿足之故，把他們危險的地位判斷錯誤了。</p>
<p>這也不過在報紙與百姓對政府保持忍耐的時候才如此，在國家千鈞一髮之時，他們的轉變也很快。這情形可從五月上旬所發生的事情來引證。自從張伯倫答應把挪威戰事完全公開報告之後，一連幾天報紙上不見激烈的言論。此時英國軍隊從北歐撤退，傷兵開始在倫敦街道上發現。這些人把戰事與英國又拉攏了一些，當張伯倫的演說未能適合報紙的期待時，他們終於向他大肄攻訐了。</p>
<p>從這個經歷看來，英國人除了冷靜的外表，和沉靜的言語之外，他們尚含蓄淸忿怒的質地。他們具有自己的束自己的藝術，這種修養，由來極久，因之忿怒的質地很不容易流露出來；要是一旦暴發，那力量却是有些可怕。</p>
<p>眼前你無論跑到英國任何地方去，很難聽到英國會戰敗的論調。英國人看到美國報紙封論萬一德國戰勝後將怎樣的紀載，表示吃驚。有些人更引為奇談。他們反覆的說，「英國人每戰皆敗，但最後一戰必勝。」他們視此為成功的圭臬，表示歡忻。</p>
<p>合作　能力為英國人第一特性。在私人談話，和多數偶爾與人交往之間，英國人第一個衝動便是合作，當你和他談話之時，他出自本性的連連點頭，表示同意，有時候他即使完全反對你的意思，他還是這樣的表示。</p>
<p>在政治上情形亦復相仿。譬如世界上任何國家，那有政府給予反對黨領袖以比普通議員還要高的俸祿的，原因是為了他費盡心力要顛覆政府呢？</p>
<p>與合作的本性並存的就是英國人與生具來的誠實性，和由此而產生對於同伴的信任心。在戰時，道自恃，合作，和信任三者常為偉大力量的泉源。但在已往的七年中，如果能在這三者上面稍為權宜些，戰爭也許早已避免，或者巳使聯軍處於極佔優勢的地位。</p>
<p>譬如，聯軍在挪威及西綫的敗北，除了美國人外，也許對於自恃力要大為搖動，作戰力量大受打擊。當然英國人在酒樓茶坊之中，對政局大體上還是要抨擊；但是因為理智方面的一些惰性，像出於他們常說的「不必大驚小怪」，和他們對於最後勝利十分堅强的信念，以及與任何當權政府合作的本性，英國人對於任何事件不常出以激烈的處置。</p>
<p>有一件事實可以證明這一點。自從聯軍由挪威撤退後，所有的報紙都主張聯軍方面必須立刻起來增造飛機，俾在天空中得　德軍分庭抗禮。這個呼聲全國一致贊成，可是所有主要飛機製迭廠，除了一家之外，在聖靈降臨節，還照舊停工休假哩哩</p>
<p>欲求解釋這樣的事，祇有拿英國的歷史來回答。因為差不多在九白年之中，侵略者從來沒有踏進英國的領土。又因自特拉法爾加一役以來，百餘年間，英國安處在北海的金城鐵壁之後，實可睥睨全球。此種自恃心，滋長日深，牢牢的印入他們腦筋，在本能方面，英國人竟不會想像有打敗仗的可能。</p>
<p>在國家危急之秋，國民本能所領導的動作，也許比較理智所產生的還要好些。英國人的本能或國民性，在今日最顯著的——公平處置的本性，合作，信任，和自我的滿足——乃在英國沒有外患的時代發展而來，那時候英國的海軍雄視全世界，而全世界的交通還正在蠕蠕而動。但是今日英國的國民性須在新的環境之下活動了。他所對付的為新而蠻幹的敵人，具有新式迅疾的武器，力能向擾勢的英國海軍挑戰，而在這種新的環境之下，英國人的性質却不能運用裕如了。</p>
<p>這里還有一個很好的例子。挪威戰役初起時，英國一架偵察機，在空中察得一處飛機塲，德軍正在飛運兵士到挪威去。那飛機塲的所在地名叫奧爾堡，地屬丹麥。當這個英國航空員在飛機塲上空偵察時發現塲中擠滿了德國的運輸機。他立刻把這事報告　峯。因為這飛機塲位於從前的中立國丹麥之內，各部長討論至三日之後始尤准英機前去轟炸，可是德國飛機已很有幾架裝運兵七飛往挪威了。</p>
<p>英國人具有硬繃繃的氣質，無須看待得過好。還有一種特質，在黃余時代深深印入他們腦筋的，就是無可比擬的責任心。英國一般人常看做英國為弱小民族的保護者。為了愛好自由半義，英人常以維護正義者自居、他除了認為必要的事情之外，不願多管閒事。他又是一個個人主義者，不願國家來干擾他的私人生活；但在危急的時候，國家所要做的一件事，只須向他大聲呼籲，他立刻就會答應去做，也小求深解為什麼理由。</p>
<p>這種愛國精神似乎潛在他骨頭之中。他對於歷史觀念甚深，對於英國無上的命運，　於有盲目的信念。他對於白種人所負責任　大一語的道　，也許不發生興趣、但是好像　萬元資本大公司中的一個一元股本的小股東，他以具有這種關係自豪，一旦國家有事，亟願以身許國。</p>
<p>眞如一位美國靑年外交家所說：「英國人需要一個人跑來，對他們登高一呼，這種呼喚須具有激起過去，現在，和將來的力量。只要有一個偉　的領袖，那末人力，勇氣和物力都已齊備，勝利可操左券」右圖係地中海咽喉直布羅陀</p>

<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>今有人焉，以征略為能事，其野心且凌駕亞力出大，凱撤，拿破崙，不特欲征服他人，且圖以革命手段，改造世界。此人正　其大軍團，猛擊最後障碍。此人即從維也納陋巷崛起，將成一萬萬人的主宰，即當代最强盛的軍閥希特勒也。此人在歷史上為豪傑抑為在人，將視其武功的成敗以為斷</p>
<p>苟置其成敗於不論，而以其手段為詊判，希特勒所夢想者，規模之大，極權性之澈底，實有前無古人之概。此種夢想之圓滿實現者巳超越幻想家的能力所及，且已成為具體的政綱，並已有舉世莫敵的軍力為其後盾。此人意志堅强，心機敏疾，毅力雄厚，担當凡人所不能勝任的重負，其身心精力令人驚歎，然則，希特勒究係何如人歟。</p>
<p>夫欲探究任何人的靈魂，度量其行為上複雜的動機，絕非易事，何况人格複雜如希特勒者乎。希特勒實具兩重人格，其一係私人的希特勒，仍未脫去其在奧地利勃勞諾鎮故鄉自食其力時情况，其一係官塲的希特勒，乃獨裁者兼軍閥，此種地位，不像墨索里尼的做作，竟與其生活打成一片。</p>
<p>私人的希特勒身材短小，貌不驚人，其平凡一如德捷邊境一帶人，所出衆的，無非在他的短髭，在他細小作靑褐色富有詩人內省性的雙目。在大庭廣衆中恒忸怩含羞，其形不雅，有此小人也」的神氣。</p>
<p>彼為健康信仰及律己計，素不食肉，且摒棄烟酒。有阿爾卑斯出民土風，而無日耳曼人氣概，顯見其非統治階級後</p>
<p>官塲的爺特勒，則係一國元首，羣衆演說家，獨裁者，軍閥，與私人的希特勒，截然兩人，此種轉變，恒突入其來，令人驚愕。此官塲的希特勒興高采烈，自信力甚强，跋扈囂張，全知全能，不可一世，不談話，唯演講，不討論，唯發號施令；不步行，唯疾駛。外形頓易，望之身材陡高。故僅在公衆前獲覩希特勒者，一旦與之對面相見，皆詫其「短小。」官塲的希特勒，容貌一變而為猙獰的面具。雙目則凝視，聲音常從沉着陰鬱提高至激越聲嘶。</p>
<p>此一希特勒也，已非具人性之人，而係一種意念化成的肉體，仇之者為之悚然，親之者如入迷，其親身衛隊及降落傘敢死隊，僅其魔力所懾服之兩種人而已。希特勒具此離奇的素質，乃使其演講，發生迷人的魔力，一般聽衆有時竟捧之若神。</p>
<p>此外，尚有第三個秘密的希特勒，僅其親信知之。此一希特勒也，其神經雖為彼兩重人格間的矛盾，及彼担荷的重負所苦，但能迅即自行統制，若無其事，邁步前進。</p>
<p>希特勒除愛其母外，會吾愛慕任何男子或婦女，固無人知之，彼除矢忠其自許的使命外，是否忠於他事，亦非他人所知，彼於「我的奮鬥」一書中，除對其母氏及奧地利故鄉衣示愛慕外，餘則滿紙詆責反抗之辭，以為一切不值一顧。彼首先反抗者為其管束過嚴之父，彼對之僅表敬意」，而反對其父迫子入狹隘仕途。繼則憎惡學校章程，阻止其獲得正式教育。爺特勒父憎惡泛日耳曼人與捷克人在其誕生地邊區作劇烈的民族鬥爭。希特勒整個童年生活，受此鬪爭之影響。其第一種政治觀念，即國社主義運動中的民族主義，實種因於此。厥後，維也納藝術學院不認希特勒具有藝術天才，亦曾激起其憤怨。</p>
<p>其次，希特勒並鄙惡社會經濟政治制度，迫其為建築工匠，郵片畫師，俾在維也納及慕尼克貧民窟糊口。彼又憎恨馬克斯主義者迫其加入工會，常使其失業。在此釩寒交迫之時，乃　恨一切現狀，如奧地利之哈勃斯堡皇室，議會制度，馬克斯主義，及猶太人。此種怨毒日久，養成一種反抗精神。</p>
<p>上决大戰四年後，希特勒會見德國崩潰，本人亦一貧如洗。個人的恥辱及民族的怨慣，合而將餘燼煽成燎原大火。時希特勒為德國軍事當局偵查政治活動，偶與復國志士相値，頗感興趣，起而向之演說，發覺本人富有演說天下，足以左右人心。其政治領袖及亙古最偉大的革命　生涯於焉開始。</p>
<p>使希特勒嶄然露頭角者，當然非僅口才一端。謀復興德國者，大有人在，成功者唯希特勒一人，推原其故，鄙惡一切固為有力的原動力，但農家世代相傳的天生機警，直覺及敏感，抓住要旨，不為環境所左右，也是他成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>要之，希特勒早年落拓，並身歷社會國家潰亂景象，因乃養成一種鄙惡心理，旋又發揮成革命的在熱。旣巳有所成就，乃對本人命運及其所負改革世界的使命，具有一種莫可動搖的信念。</p>
<p>希特勒生活簡單，飲食節制，身為世界一大强國元首，然猶未能甘心者，實因希特勒主義已高於希特勒本人，彼現已為自己創立之運動所束縛，而此運動無異脚踏車，非前進，即傾簡。（譯紐約泰晤士報）</p>

<h3 id="c102">爲暑期作業競賽說幾句話 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 俞俞</p>
<p>此次本報發起暑期作業競賽，原想用競賽方式，鼓舞兒童自學精神，用獎勵方法，引起兒童自學興味，所定競賽項目，雖未能包括小學各種科目，不足以替代學校暑期作業的全部，但至少可以當作推動兒童暑期作業的新動力。希望各位教師接受本報這點微意，把本報的作業題目，列入本年暑期作業內，切實指導兒童去練習。所有作品，務求保存兒童的眞面目，因為參加競賽的目的，不在得獎，而在利用鼓舞兒童作業的新因素，養成自學的習慣，這是對教師們說的話。家庭與學校必須密切合作，暑假期內，兒童過着家庭生活，督促暑期作業的責任，無疑的由家長負担，把作業全部勻排在整個假期中，教子女按部就班的廠去，要注意子弟的有始無終，要注意子女的潦草賽責，與其用嚴格的督責，不如用積極的鼓勵，嚴格督責的結果，往往是勉強，是敷衍，積極的鼓勵，才能使兒童興奮與努力，這是對家長們說的話。</p>
<p>小朋友，暑假期內，老師們給你的作業，與正課有同樣的重要，應該尊重教師的命令，利用淸晨凉晚，排定目修表，不問家長是否督促，要自己管理自己，始終切實自修，意思要想得周到，謄寫要工正淸潔畫圖要正確精美，做完一題，更須細心檢點，改正錯誤，盡你最大的努力，做出自己認為滿意的績，如果希望得獎，請哥哥姊姊做搶手，想欺騙別人，自己先成為不誠實的孩子，不誠實三字，不是最可恥的名詞嗎？所以非由自己努力不可。這是對小朋友們說的話。</p>
<h3 id="c103">斯巴達孩子的訓練 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 爭榮</p>
<p>在古代希臘最著名的城市，是斯巴達。某一個時期中，斯巴達是一個很强盛的國家，因為國內有着勇敢而强健的人民。那些勇敢而强健的人民，就是在孩子時代嚴格訓練而成的。</p>
<p>斯巴達孩子所受的訓練，有點近乎過甚。在現在看起來，是殘忍的。當一個小孩出世的時候，須受嚴格檢查，健康的，交他的父母教養；倘若是病弱的，便將他拋在深山裏，讓他餓死或是被山上的野獸生吞。</p>
<p>所以，祇有一羣健康的小孩子是長大成人。然而，當他們到了七歲，父要離開家庭，到教育所去受嚴格的體育上的訓練。當這次訓練之後，沒有一個人是曉得懶惰的。他們在晚上睡在蘆草上面，當作柔軟的眠床，穿的衣服是一年四季中祇有一件長袍，而在晚上却作為被單之用。</p>
<p>斯巴達的孩子，完全訓練成能够有忍痛耐勞的精神，從不曾為了痛苦而發出呻吟聲，因為在他們看來，怕痛是被認為一樁最可恥的事情。有時候，他們由年紀較長的領導着去旅行，在崎嶇不平而荊棘叢生的路上行走，他們雖都覺得很疲倦，而且脚上又流着鮮紅的血，但是他們仍忍耐着，並極鎭靜地帶着微笑說；「我是很好呀！」</p>
<p>有一次，有一個年幼的斯巴達孩子，從山中偷了隻小的狐狸，在教室中玩弄着，然當先牛走來的時候，他便將它藏在衣裳裏面。那時候，狐狸在衣裳裏面是何等的氣悶啊！所以便咬小孩子的胸膛，希望逃到外面來，可是，那個孩子居然一些不動，若無其事的樣子，任它亂抓亂咬，直至咬死，才仆倒於地。這時，他的先生發覺了之後，着實稱讚過那個孩子的忍痛精神哩。　至於斯巴達的女孩子，雖沒有男孩子那麼殘忍的訓練，然個個都是健康得很，並目還教訓伊們去愛最最勇敢的男孩子，亦引以為榮的事情。所以斯巴達的興盛，實在從他們的孩子時代已定下基礎。</p>

<p>又是交進炎夏的季節了，天氣是道樣的酷熱，阿慧的舉校裏也快將結束，所以這幾天的大考已開始了，阿慧也不得不把這一學期的功課好好地預備一下。</p>
<p>一陣陣敲擊的聲音，打從廚房裏傳出來，把阿慧讀書的情緒驅散了。原來阿明－他哥哥把一大張簇新的洋鐵皮釘在一隻大木箱上。「他在幹什麽？」</p>
<p>「做一隻簡便冰箱。」阿明揩了揩頭上的汗，接口回答着。</p>
<p>「自己做的，總沒有買來的好。」阿慧想把這句話，使他哥哥的工作止住，因為那打擊聲是很刺身的。實在是打擾了他的讀書。</p>
<p>「不見得吧，要知今年去買一隻普通的冰箱，價錢是貴上四五倍，電氣冰箱不要說了，數千塊錢一隻，把窮人都嚇死了，我們何不廢物利用，自己來造，所得的效果也不差。」</p>
<p>於是阿明又開始工作了，木箱外包上了一張洋鐵皮，在木箱內部的每一條罅兒，用汕灰嵌塞得很妥貼，更把一隻火油箱放在木箱的中間，四周把細木屑撳　得很緊密，便變成了一隻雙套的箱子，那隻冰箱便這樣的告成了，但所費無幾，因為這些原料在阿慧家裏都是備目的。</p>

<p>— 民</p>
<p>可甘，你走近了我，讓五湊著你的耳朶說一句話。這一天我去試那鏡頭，實在是我一輩子最快樂的日子。那時節眞好玩得很可惜不能仔仔細細地告知你。先前從沒有進過電影公司的攝影塲，媽媽也沒有去過，因此我們母女倆都激動得很。媽媽的激動，是不知道我試鏡頭時，可要發生出什麼事情來，又不知道我司要嚇得說小出話或手足無措起來。至於我的激動呢，却並不為此，只有那攝影塲大得很，也神奇得很。它好像一個天花板很高而沒有窗子的大山洞，比了阿拉亭神燈故事中的山洞和白雪公主故中事的山洞還要大得多。只為太大了，我也不知道從那裏看起才好。這一天攝影塲上，還有別的小孩子們在看，也是來試鏡頭的。但我們並不注意試鏡頭這回事，老是在攝影塲中東張西望，東跑西闖，開開道扇門，推推這扇門，在門裏穿來穿去，又在椅子上跳上跳　，好像猴子一樣。我們隨處找得到帽子，然而戴在頭上，都是不配的。此外又見各式各樣的繩子，散開在地板匕，也不知道作什麽用的。又有許多挺大的燈，照矅得非常明亮，你的眼睛要是對它看了一二分鐘，就會張不開。</p>
<p>於是最最有趣最有玩的事情接着來了。雷蒙先生和一位海士先生（他名叫傑克，據說是電影監造人）喚我們都把衣服脫下來。原來他們所要攝製的，是一部叫做「孩子玩笑我一的影片，所有表演的角色，全是我們這班小孩子。他們要我們脫了衣服，將尿布似的一塊東西穿起來，前面用大別針栓住了。當下那些媽媽們就照着兩位先生的話把伊們兒女的衣服紛紛脫下，我也當然照辦，大家便穿着那塊尿布似的東西亂跑起來。</p>
<p>先就輪着我試，我得站在攝影機前，微微地笑，又霎霎眼睛，跳一個舞，把肩胛搖擺了二三下，說一聲「是的，我愛！」可甘，這一句是用法蘭西話說的。試想一想，我第一次試鏡頭，却就說法蘭西話，這眞出於我的意外。我聽得他們說，這「孩兒玩笑我」的第一部單本影片，名叫「戰爭之兒」，他們唉我做一個咖啡店中的法蘭西小舞女，所以我不能說英吉利話，而要說法蘭西話的。現在巳由白克蘭小姐教我法蘭西文，所以我已知道這句法蘭西話的意思，但在當時我却一些兒不知道。雷蒙先生喚我這般說，我不過照着他的聲音學舌罷了。試騐完畢之後，雷蒙先生對我媽媽說道：“過幾天後，我自會給你知道今天試驗秀蘭的結果，」</p>
<p>凡是讀我這篇自傳的小朋友們，讀到這，裏就可知道試一鏡頭，正和做一個餅一般容易。那時我簡直一些兒不吃嚇，我只覺得一切都好，神經不並緊張。你可知道緊張的是誰？却是媽媽我們回去之後，你知道緊張又是那一個却是爸爸！我斜你聽了這話，也許要奇怪，因為他老人家先前是不願意我踏入界電影的，現在怎麼會關心起來呢？原來他先前以為我們決不會有這個機會，所以打定主意不願作此妄想。如今一聽得我已試過鏡頭分明已成了事實，於是他希望我踏入電影界，比了媽媽為懇切。</p>

<p>— 阿漢</p>
<p>在皮黃劇改良運動的推進中，移風劇團在周信芳的領導　，確是擔負了本位的使命，所演「明末遺恨」「香妃恨」「徽欽二帝」各劇，都博輿論的好評，「文素臣」的演出，雖則强調兒女私情的描寫，但在穿揷塲面中間，仍舊灌輸着針對現時代的正確思想。</p>
<p>最近，外間盛傳着移風劇團將要解散了，這在筆者驚奇下，感到那是个會眞的，但多方面探聽下來，果然並非完全空穴來風。</p>
<p>原來卡爾登戲院，建築上確是適合演劇的條伴，但在熱天，空間就非借重冷氣小足驅暑了，因此往年都是開放冷氣的。然而今年，冰價奇貴，統計一天的消耗，竟要五六百元，這當然得不償失，於是決定在下月八日起，開始歇良，待到秋凉後重行開慕。</p>
<p>但是，問題就在歇夏的一個過渡期中，因為旣然停演，院方自然難以照付包銀，這在大小角兒們，不得不另謀出路，同時如果一旦謀得出路，父不能祇唱了二三個月後冉來加入，於是，雙方會商下來，就借歇夏的名目，暫時宣告解散</p>
<p>當然，周信芳是絕對不會放棄卡爾登的地盤，而且他的思想，比一般皮黃劇從業員前進，所以預備秋凉後，將以全副精神東組移風劇團，同時在這抗建的重要關頭，在他感到更要努力出演意識健全的戲劇，以便鼓勵民氣，堅强人心呢！</p>

<p>大家知道組合成為一種歌曲的主要條件，第一是詞句，第二是腔調，第三是節拍，這二條條件，無論何種歌曲，都是缺一不可的。或者以為搖板可以不受節拍的拘束，這是沒有深知灼見的緣故，要知道即使慢板快板，也並不須受節拍的拘束，但不能與節拍不吻合，同時搖板雖然不用拍板，但疾徐之間，也有個相當的節度，此則可與知者道，難令淺識者澈底了解也。</p>
<p>關於詞句的編撰，無疑地是崑曲最雅馴，閩夸劇和京音大鼓决之，彈詞蘇灘又决之，平漢微紹，則如一邱之貉，（平劇如梅程新編的私房戲，不在此例，）梆子申曲等類，更覺粗俗。至於念字的準確，也以崑曲為最講究，四聲是塡譜時已替你安排好了，所以不管怎樣的初學淺識，腔不對時上不了笛，腔對了字就不會倒，學的時候，對於字，祗要注意陰陽尖團反切就是了。別的戲呢。大概都是土音多，官音少，（此官音也可說是中州韻，）大鼓幾乎是全部用土音，所以祇宜於懂得本地方　的人，纔能聽出興味來，惟有平劇，却是純粹採取中州韻的。或者又說，嘗見許多一句外國話不懂的人，却偏喜歡看電影，他們怎麽會聽出興味來的呢？倒教我一時很難解答，不過可以決定的，他們底目的，決不是專門去聽話或聆歌，至少總含着大部份看情節和景緻的意思，所以不懂外國話的人，應該說去看電影或瞧電影，決不能說去聽電影，本來聽電影這句話，也祇是北方人的話頭，南方人通常是說去看影戲的（未完）</p>

<p>霍桑祗微微點點頭，唇角上却露出一絲微笑。這一笑分明又加深了那老先生的窘態。老人向着他的已死的內姪女瞧瞧，搖搖頭。</p>
<p>他又說：「霍先生，你總也知道，這樣的朋友，並不在我們數千年來尊重的五倫之內的。我是極端不贊成的。可是麗蘭年紀大了，究竟不是我的親生女兒，我那裏管得住伊？」</p>
<p>霍桑微微嘆一口氣，作安慰聲道：「那當然不能怪你。其實在這上海地方，像道種方式的所謂朋友，早已普遍地被認作第六倫！」</p>
<p>李芝範連連晃幾晃頭嘆道：唉，「放僻邪侈，無不為已！」……上海眞是個萬惡的地方！不過在我陳腐的腦筋看來，這樣的朋友，說出口來總有些慚愧。」</p>
<p>霍桑向他瞟了一眼，點頭道：「李先生，你眞是個端謹的君子人。……除了這陸健笙以外，可還有別的「朋友」供給伊？」</p>
<p>「這個我不仔細。不過伊的朋友的確不少。」</p>
<p>「那末，伊是不是還有另外的收入，你也不知道罷？」</p>
<p>「我不知道。我難得到這裏來，現在跟伊也很客氣，當然不便仔細查問伊。」</p>
<p>「不錯，那末伊的許多朋友裏面，你所知道的有幾個？」</p>
<p>李芝範又遲疑地說：「這個我也說不出什麽。我到上海的那天，看見有兩個穿西裝的少年跟麗蘭在這裏吵嘴。一個年紀輕些，據說姓余。另外一個個子高一些，這幾天常在這裏出進，可是我不知道他的姓名。」</p>
<p>霍桑立起身來，走到書桌面前，又將抽屜拉開，從抽屜裏拿出剛纔發見的幾張男子照片。李芝範跟看霍桑走近書桌。他一瞧見抽屜的內容，彷彿怔了一怔。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yesterday, Japanese Troops Landed in Fo Xiao, Bao'an, and Advanced on Shenzhen by Land, While Aircraft Scouted and Bombed Villages Everywhere, Aiming to Cut Off Transportation Between Hong Kong and Chongqing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: British military authorities here announced today that Japanese troops are currently occupying certain areas bordering Hong Kong in order to eliminate Chinese guerrillas. The Japanese authorities had notified the British military authorities of this intention, so there is no need to panic. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A batch of Japanese troops landed in Nantou Port, Guangdong Province, this morning and suddenly advanced towards the border between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. According to a statement by a British military spokesperson here, "Recently, Chinese guerrillas have been extremely active, causing considerable anxiety to the Japanese side. The Japanese army will occupy several strongholds adjacent to Hong Kong, intending to eliminate these guerrillas. They had previously notified the British military authorities of this intention, so residents need not be alarmed." (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: It is estimated that there are 3,000 Japanese troops who arrived in the vicinity of the Hong Kong border at sunset. It is believed that more are continuing to arrive. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are engaged in reconnaissance throughout the day and from time to time drop bombs on villages to prevent Chinese army resistance, but the Chinese army there has already evacuated. Observers now believe that the Japanese military's actions are intended as a prelude to protesting to the British government for allowing military supplies to pass through the Burma Road to Chongqing. The current situation is similar to that in French Indochina, with an increasing number of refugees crossing the British border. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The Japanese military authorities in South China issued a declaration stating that Hong Kong is still supplying Chongqing with materials. The Japanese army has landed in the area adjacent to the British concession of Kowloon in order to "finally cut off this route." The original text is as follows: "At a time when the European war is raging, Hong Kong is still supplying Chongqing with materials, which is of great significance. The Japanese army has now taken action to finally cut off this route." The declaration also stated that six teams of Japanese troops landed in the Bao'an area adjacent to the British concession of Kowloon at dawn today. It also stated that Japanese troops are currently advancing in the area north of British territory. A statement issued by the British military authorities in Hong Kong stated that Japanese troops are currently occupying several areas bordering Hong Kong in order to eliminate Chinese guerrillas, and that the Japanese military had notified the British military authorities of this intention, so there is no need to panic. According to Hong Kong news, 400 Japanese troops have landed in Nantou and are advancing on Shenzhen by land. At the same time, Shenzhen was bombed by two Japanese aircraft, causing several casualties. Refugees are now beginning to cross the Hong Kong border again. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: France's concessions to Japan regarding the transportation of supplies through Vietnam have deeply troubled Chinese political circles here. It is said that the Chinese side may negotiate with the French government. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: A Japanese spokesperson here recently commented on the alleged transportation of military equipment to Chongqing via Vietnam, stating that the Japanese authorities in South China have recently investigated and learned that 5,000 tons of war equipment and 100 trucks are transported daily from the Vietnamese border to the Chinese mainland via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. If this unfriendly state of international relations continues, we will have no choice but to take appropriate measures to end it. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Some people here today believe that the Japanese military authorities may immediately put pressure on Britain to block the Burma Road to China, preventing the transport of military supplies into the Chinese mainland. These people believe that although France has not allowed the transport of Chinese military supplies via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Burma Road has not been blocked. The Japanese authorities may demand the closure of the Burma Road. These people also believe that their speculation is becoming more credible due to the actions of the Japanese military headquarters in Guangdong, as the Guangzhou Japanese army has treated France as a belligerent, as if it would disregard any agreements concluded by the Tokyo government. These people believe that Japan may use pressure tactics against Hong Kong, as it did last August. According to unconfirmed rumors here, the Japanese army in Guangzhou may advance towards the Hong Kong border within a few days. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Several Japanese aircraft began bombing Chinese military positions near Bao'an, north of Hong Kong, early this morning. At around 8 a.m., a team of Japanese troops, under the cover of naval and air forces, forcibly landed in Bao'an and then advanced eastward. By noon, the Japanese army had reached Baishi, five kilometers east of Bao'an. When the Japanese army invaded Bao'an, the Chinese army fought valiantly, but was forced to retreat eastward due to being outnumbered. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place near Baishi between the two sides. Another team of Japanese troops landed at Chiwan on the Sino-British border at dawn today and is now advancing eastward. It is reported that Chinese reinforcements have advanced eastward from Danshui, and fierce fighting is expected within the day. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to sources on the Japanese side here, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Bao'an, north of Hong Kong, this morning with the aim of blockading the area to prevent British merchants in Hong Kong from profiting from the fact that the Japanese army is not stationed there. The Japanese army had stationed troops in Bao'an until December of last year, and only withdrew from the area on December 3rd to satisfy the wishes of the British government and implement a partial opening of the Pearl River. However, the British merchants in Hong Kong have been increasingly profiting from the Bao'an area and have recently become more blatant, so the Japanese authorities will not hesitate to use force to intervene when necessary.

<p>Somewhere in Eastern Jiangxi: On the 20th, the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on Nanchang again. One route attacked strongholds such as Cimuwan and Dazangqiao, and Japanese positions in the Cimuwan area fell into Chinese hands again. At the same time, a detachment of commando troops was sent to operate deep behind Japanese lines, completely destroying the Dalu Bridge, seven kilometers east of Nanchang city. Another route advanced north along the railway line and reoccupied Xiangtang, destroying many Japanese fortifications west of the city. They are currently engaged in bloody battles with the Japanese in the suburbs of the city. The Chinese army has also penetrated deep behind Japanese lines and is developing in a certain direction.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e4">Mr. Song Ziwen Goes to the United States <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>According to a Manila telegram, it has been confirmed that Mr. Song Ziwen of China has flown to the United States. What kind of mission does Mr. Song bear on this trip? Is his activity limited to the economic realm? All parties are silent, and it is not clear to outsiders. However, there are several prominent basic themes that are placed before the world and are recognized by everyone: First, China's three years of resistance have demonstrated the strength of the national spirit, the abundance of potential, the correctness and firmness of policy, and the brightness of the future; as for the resistance itself, its significance has long been understood and sympathized with internationally, and the recent extreme changes in the international situation have further shown that the resistance has made a great contribution to the overall world situation; therefore, China and China's resistance are gaining higher and higher new valuations internationally. Second, among the powerful neutral countries internationally, the United States and the Soviet Union are the most prominent; both the United States and the Soviet Union have great strength, both have the most acute interests in the Pacific, both have clear policies towards the Far East, both have fair positions on the Sino-Japanese War, and both have the warmest feelings for China; recently, the Soviet Union has had to be more vigilant about the European war, while the United States has concretized its Far East policy and is launching various clear and effective measures. Third, although modern international relations have complex and multifaceted aspects, economic factors account for the highest proportion; Mr. Song Ziwen occupies an important position in China's financial and monetary circles, and the highest authorities rely on him deeply, and he has superior reputation and credibility in the United States; from these three points, even without pursuing the true mission of Mr. Song's trip, one can imagine how subtle and important his contribution to the rich and future relationship between China and the United States will be.</p>
<p>The diplomacy between countries is originally woven from various relationships of interest, emotion, and treaties; but there are two other bases, one is strength, and the other is sincerity. Strength is an effective backing for a country to exert its ideas and actions externally. The so-called "weak countries have no diplomacy" should be interpreted in this way. Of course, weak countries can sometimes use diplomacy to improve their position, such as the French representative Talleyrand at the Vienna Conference in the past, and Cavour, the ruler of Italy during the founding of the country, were all good at using diplomacy; but this is only effective for a while, and the increasing international status of France and Italy later was still due to the gradual enrichment of national power. Bismarck was a great diplomat and was also known as the "Iron Chancellor." Iron and blood are the backing of Bismarck's diplomacy. For example, after the First World War, France's diplomatic net can also be considered tightly woven, but now, due to the relative inferiority of its military power, the diplomatic net cannot compensate for the disaster. Another key point of diplomacy is sincerity. A country without sincerity will eventually fail in diplomacy. Japan's diplomacy in the past sixty years can be regarded as extremely active; at first, it used the Anglo-Japanese alliance to defeat Tsarist Russia; then it participated in the European war and reaped the benefits of the fisherman; in recent years, with its feathers slightly plumped, it wanted to make friends with Germany from afar and take the rights and interests of the British and American countries in the Far East. But looking at the fact that before the outbreak of the European war last year, Japan wanted to conclude a military alliance with Germany on the condition of not participating in European affairs, it can be seen that Japan only wanted to use Germany and had absolutely no sincerity. Therefore, at present, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are certainly opposed to Japan, and even Germany can see through the true face of Japanese diplomacy. Japanese diplomacy is thus trapped in isolation.</p>
<p>Holding the above standards to measure Chinese diplomacy, it is clear that the foundation of Chinese diplomacy is solid. Since China launched the war of resistance against Japan, the important direct gains in diplomacy have been: (1) The conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China; (2) Four public loans from Britain and the United States to China, namely, the US loan of 25 million yuan in December of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the British loan of 500,000 pounds, the British loan of 5 million pounds in March of the 28th year, and the new US loan of 20 million yuan in March of this year; (3) Last June, China and the Soviet Union concluded a new commercial treaty, which is a broad and favorable treaty for China. In addition, the various forms of pressure exerted by various countries on Japan are indirect achievements of China. Britain and the United States are three major powers with close ties to the Far East. They are in a position of sharp confrontation with Japan, and exclusively devote their friendship to China. This is certainly due to their complete alignment of interests with China, and the Chinese nation's consistent emphasis on integrity and sincerity is also an important key. Moreover, China has been tempered in the war for a full three years, and its military position is increasingly strengthened, and its strength is increasingly abundant. It is like a core of the Asian continent and a cornerstone of world peace, and its diplomatic situation will naturally be strengthened accordingly. With the exception of Japan, all countries consider it beneficial to join hands with an independent and autonomous China, and there is a need for this in fact. China occupies this important international position, and is also supplemented by its own sincerity and abundant strength. Therefore, the bright future of Chinese diplomacy is known without the need for much explanation. At such an important time and under good conditions, Mr. Song Ziwen went to the United States, which must have great significance and will be recognized by all parties. Recently, US President Roosevelt has been able to use bold tactics in diplomatic policy and has done a lot; Mr. Stimson, a Republican leader who has always been tough against aggression and is particularly familiar with the Far East situation, has also abandoned party boundaries and cooperated closely with the president; therefore, how Mr. Song Ziwen's motive power will be after arriving in the United States is impossible to predict now, but the superiority of the environment surrounding him is truly easy to obtain. Mr. Song is not a skillful diplomat. He is known for his sincerity and honesty. This trip to the United States can obtain precious guests and rich harvests, although it depends on his efforts, but it should not be an accident.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Troops in the Suburbs of Yichang Are Encircled and Annihilated by the Chinese, Major Results Are Achieved by the Chinese Army in Western Xiangyang, and the Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses in Fierce Fighting South of Chongyang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In the continuous battles on the west bank of the Xiang River in the Yichang war zone, the Chinese army has been developing smoothly. The current war situation is described as follows: (1) In the Yichang area, the Japanese, trapped in the suburbs of Yichang City, have been strengthening fortifications and rushing to repair the airport in the past two days, attempting to defend the suburbs to the death and resist the Chinese stubbornly. They have now achieved the goal of the Chinese army to attract the Japanese, and the Chinese are gradually destroying them according to their consistent tactics. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese dispatched more than 6,000 people from Dangyang to reinforce them. They were intercepted by the Chinese army in the Dadongwan Songjiaju area north of Longquanpu, and fierce fighting broke out. The battle lasted until the morning of the 22nd, killing more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled towards Dangyang. The Chinese also seized 4 Japanese mountain guns and 6 mortars, as well as many light and heavy machine guns and rifles. At this point, the external aid to the Japanese in Yichang has been cut off. (2) In the Dangyang area, the Chinese army has been deploying extremely mobile and flexible forces in the past two days. After suffering serious blows from the Chinese army everywhere, the Japanese army gradually realized that their deployment was wrong. On the 20th, the Japanese used a part of their forces to counterattack Yuxi River (east of Dangyang), which was captured by the Chinese army. The Chinese army intercepted them head-on and attacked the rear of the Japanese army, inflicting heavy losses on them. The Japanese army was greatly frustrated and trapped near the Yuxi River. The Chinese are still intensifying the encirclement and annihilation. At the same time, another Japanese force in Dangyang broke out towards Huangjiaji (northeast of Dangyang). After being intercepted by a certain Chinese unit, they reached the area designated by the Chinese army on the 21st. They were immediately encircled on both wings and fiercely attacked, killing more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. Few of the remnants took the opportunity to escape and fled south. (3) In the Jingmen-Shashi area, the Chinese army has been developing particularly rapidly, and has achieved great results, completing the task of capturing key points. They are currently deploying to encircle and annihilate the Japanese in the area of Qunji Tupu (south of Jingmen), Machengpu, and Shenjiaji (all southeast of Jingmen). (Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>A dispatch from a certain place in western Hubei: After the Chinese army completed a strong encirclement outside Yichang, the Xiangsha Road was completely under the control of the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese troops in Yipangshan and Yangchalu in the suburbs of Yichang are being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army one by one. A part of more than 1,000 Japanese troops broke out to the east on the 20th. After being intercepted by the Chinese, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were annihilated. A certain Chinese unit attacked the Japanese in the Linjiapei Taihechang area, and the casualties were even greater. The Chinese army around Dangyang gradually compressed the encirclement, and the remnants of the Japanese army were cramped in the suburbs of the city, in an extremely embarrassed state. (Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Pingjiang: On the southern Hubei front, a certain Chinese vanguard army completely destroyed all the highway bridges between Chongyang and Dashaping on the 21st. The Japanese's communication was cut off, and they panicked and scurried around. The Chinese took advantage of the Japanese troops being far away from their fortifications and divided their forces to encircle and fiercely attack them, causing more than 1,000 casualties in the area in the past day, especially in the battle near Xiangu Mountain, south of Chongyang, which was the most tragic. The Chinese captured countless ammunition, weapons, and military supplies. (Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Chinese army has achieved major results in the annihilation war against the Japanese in western Hubei. The recent victories of the various routes are recorded separately as follows: (1) The Chinese army northwest of Dangyang attacked the Japanese this morning and captured Xiakou Sunbinzhai. The Japanese were defeated and retreated. At the same time, the Chinese army attacked Ma'anshan again and fought fiercely with the Japanese for half a day, capturing the mountain. The Japanese corpses were all over the mountain valley, and the losses were extremely heavy. Currently, the Chinese army is approaching Qianxichang and crossing the west bank of the Jushui River, and is fiercely attacking the Japanese in the south of Dangyang. (2) In the Zhaoyangguan mountain area west of Jingmen, the Chinese army bravely attacked the Japanese, killing more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers and completely breaking up the main force of the Japanese army. At the same time, the Chinese army destroyed 32 Japanese tanks and seized countless military supplies. (3) After the Chinese army recovered Yandunji in Jingmen, the Chinese took advantage of the victory to pursue and completely controlled the traffic between Dangyang and Shilipu. Currently, the rear route of the Japanese army in that area has been cut off, and the Chinese army is encircling and annihilating the remnants of the Japanese army. (Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Zaoyang: The Chinese army on both sides of the Jingzhong Road has been quite successful in entering and exiting behind the Japanese lines, and is currently attacking the Japanese entrenched in various strongholds. In the Dabongshan area, yesterday the Chinese army encountered a remnant of the Japanese army at Xinwujia Village (northeast of Huangjiaji). The Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely, killing countless Japanese soldiers, and the remnants of the Japanese army fled in all directions. The Chinese captured many military supplies.

<p>Bordeaux: News reports indicate that the French Cabinet is currently convening prolonged meetings to consider the German armistice proposals brought back by the French representative from Compiègne. According to a French communique, cabinet members met late into the night, commencing at 1 a.m. under the chairmanship of President Lebrun, to discuss the German armistice terms. The first meeting adjourned at 3 a.m., and cabinet members resumed discussions at 8 a.m. The Cabinet is engaged in extended deliberations but must interrupt proceedings to communicate with French representatives via telephone. The official details of the terms remain strictly confidential. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Compiègne: Negotiations for the Franco-German armistice agreement began yesterday at 3:30 p.m. near Compiègne. The negotiations are taking place in the same train carriage where Franco-German negotiations occurred in 1918, formerly belonging to General Foch. General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, read the preamble of the German conditions in the presence of Führer Hitler. After the preamble was read, Hitler departed, and negotiations began. The chief German representative is General Keitel, and the chief French representative is General Huntziger. The negotiations are conducted entirely in German because Huntziger was born in Alsace, and the other French representatives are also exceptionally fluent in German. After the German terms were presented, the French representatives withdrew to a nearby tent at 4:24 p.m. to deliberate among themselves and report by telephone to the Bordeaux government. At 6:10 p.m., they returned to the dining car to discuss with General Keitel. These discussions are still ongoing. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Compiègne: After the French representatives returned from Paris to this location, armistice negotiations resumed at 10:30 this morning and are still ongoing as of noon. The French representatives left here last night at 11 p.m. for Paris and arrived this morning with four secretaries and one female clerk. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Compiègne: According to authoritative German sources, the representatives of the Franco-German peace conference are extremely busy today discussing Hitler's armistice terms. Discussions will continue this afternoon, and it is rumored that a communiqué will be issued upon the conclusion of the afternoon discussions. After traveling to Paris last night, the French representatives arrived here this morning. The French representatives first engaged in internal discussions at 10:30 a.m. After an hour of debate, they invited the German representatives to a joint roundtable meeting, which is currently in progress and expected to continue for several more hours. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the German News Agency, the French representatives continued armistice negotiations with German General Keitel at Compiègne at 6:10 p.m. yesterday. Although the content of the German terms has not been publicly released, the "Evening News" hinted that Germany will demand France's complete disarmament. The paper stated, "France can only choose between accepting peace and transferring all military equipment to Germany, or watching its military equipment be forcibly seized by the German army." (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The "German General Review" wrote an article yesterday to indicate the demands France should implement within the scope of the armistice. The article vaguely stated that France should bear these demands because its ally Britain has placed it in a dangerous position. The paper continued, "Regarding these demands, France must know that, within the scope of fixed demands, Germany must also consider that it is currently at war with Britain. Therefore, our demand is to prevent France from participating in the war again. This is the necessary meaning of any armistice condition. This may seem to be the only condition that harms France, but in Germany, this condition is a guarantee for continuing the war against Britain and a prerequisite for us to achieve a new peace." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>In the Forest of Compiègne: The Situation of Franco-German Negotiations</p>
<p>Compiègne: According to Haitong News Agency correspondent Schroeder, the location where Franco-German armistice negotiations were conducted yesterday is the same site where armistice negotiations were held on November 11, 1918. The ceremony was more solemn than before, but the Germans did not treat the other party with the same humiliation as a complete victor. All roads in the Compiègne Forest were guarded by German troops. In the square, there is a monument with the inscription, "The harassment of Germany was shattered here." The train used for the negotiations is still a regular dining car of the International Sleeping-Car Company. Hitler sat with his back to the monument. To his right were Aviation Minister Göring, Naval Commander Raeder, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. To his left were General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Party Representative Hess. Opposite them, in the center, was the chief French representative, General Huntziger, with Vice-Admiral Le Luc to his left, and Ambassador Noël and General Berger to his right. When the French representatives boarded the train, Hitler and his entourage stood up to welcome them. After taking their seats, General Keitel recited the preamble to the armistice agreement. After reciting, Hitler disembarked at 3:42 p.m. and departed. While passing the cemetery for fallen soldiers, the guards shouted, "Führer! The Great German Army salutes the Supreme Commander!" One of the most splendid scenes in modern European history was staged in the Compiègne Forest. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Rumors of Italian Conditions: Even More Severe Than Germany's</p>
<p>Bordeaux Port: French newspapers have no reporters in Compiègne and therefore have not released any news. Their argument is that if Germany forces France to accept harsh conditions, it will contradict Germany's own objectives. For example, Le Figaro reported, "Germany cannot fully execute the duties of a gendarme. Therefore, if it wants France to fully accept the future treaty, the conditions must be reasonable." Furthermore, the newspapers generally state that the enemy is breathless and sweating profusely due to excessive effort. For the sake of France, a lenient armistice agreement must be obtained. According to "Le Jour," rumors suggest that the conditions proposed by Italy are even more severe than those of Germany, but informed sources have not confirmed this. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Milan: According to "Il Popolo d'Italia," the French delegation that accepted the German armistice conditions in Compiègne will travel to Italy to receive Italy's armistice conditions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

In recent days, the number of enemy prisoners captured in this area has exceeded 200,000 and is increasing daily. Countless naval, military, and logistical supplies have been seized in northern France. Notably, the occupation of several enemy aircraft factories has resulted in the capture of over 260 aircraft. German fighter planes and dive bombers are bombing enemy fortresses and troop concentration areas. At the mouth of the Loire River, a merchant ship of 8,000 tons was sunk, a merchant ship of 4,000 tons was heavily damaged, and two motorboats were destroyed. The German Air Force bombed important military targets on the east coast of England and bombed the armaments industrial center of Billingham, with many direct hits. This afternoon, an air battle occurred over Texel Island near the Netherlands, resulting in the downing of six enemy aircraft, with three others fleeing in defeat. British bombers attempted to attack German warships but were shot down by German anti-aircraft fire. German destroyers also shot down seven enemy aircraft. In total, the enemy lost 25 aircraft yesterday, including 11 shot down in combat, six shot down by anti-aircraft fire, six shot down by warships, and the remainder destroyed on the ground by bombing. One German aircraft is missing. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e12">France's Defeat Due to Commanders' Incompetence: Pétain and Weygand's Indecisiveness Causes Pain to Patriots' Hearts; Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George Issues Statement <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>London: Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George, during a conversation with a United Press reporter, severely criticized French Premier General Pétain, saying that Pétain was so cowardly that he raised the white flag, although the war would certainly not end because of this. Lloyd George continued to attribute France's failure to the right-leaning and indecisive nature of General Pétain and Allied Commander General Weygand. Those in France with self-respect and patriotism will never forget these people who have stolen the nation and insulted the French people. Lloyd George praised President Roosevelt's stance towards totalitarian states, as well as his appointment of Knox as Secretary of the Navy and Stimson as Secretary of War, saying that this was a manifestation of President Roosevelt's true courage and had made a profound and positive impression on Britain. Lloyd George continued to point out that besieged French isolated troops are still fighting in French territory. Given this situation, it is too early to predict that the fall of France will affect all of Europe. This is indeed a strange war. Until yesterday morning, no one dared to say what France would do. Since Premier General Pétain and the French premier and military commander discussed and ordered the French army to stop fighting for several days, French troops everywhere are still shooting at advancing enemies. Although the resistance of some troops is not very strong and has not seriously hindered the German advance southward, most organized French troops are still engaged in heroic resistance everywhere. The French troops in the lower section of the Maginot Line have not yet surrendered, and the brave Alpine troops are preparing to defend the Alps. These troops are the best in the French army. German tanks will find it difficult to climb mountain paths, and they will engage in defensive warfare with bravery. The fleet commander in Toulon has also vowed never to surrender to the enemy. Pétain, who raised the white flag, gained immortal fame for defending Verdun, but in terms of Pétain's military character, he is more cautious than brave. How resolute was General Foch, who saved France from extreme danger in 1918! Premier Pétain has shown no trace of this spirit of perseverance. Regarding the French defeat in December 1918, most of the reason was also due to Pétain's cowardice. At that time, the German attack on Amiens was very fierce. Pétain was unwilling to take risks and ordered his troops to move from the southern line to build strong positions behind Amiens. Later, as the German attack intensified and the lines were about to be broken, Pétain was still hesitant and repeatedly delayed. If the British and French governments had not ordered General Foch to work hard to save the situation, the German army would have cut the Allied forces into two and reached the English Channel. General Weygand is qualified as a staff officer for an expeditionary force but has never commanded troops in battle and lacks the decisiveness of his commander-in-chief. Foch and Weygand together would be a beneficial thing in military terms, but Pétain and Weygand together, since the two men are essentially two of the same nature, neither can compensate for the deficiencies of the other. This war is indeed a tragic end to a war of honor for justice and freedom. Regarding Pétain's surrender, there is also a phenomenon that will permanently affect France's political destiny: the extreme right-wing cabinet's administration before the cessation of war. No leftists participated in this cabinet. Pétain and Weygand are both famous right-wing figures. General Pétain is the one who planned to hand over the Spanish fleet to General Franco during the recent Spanish Civil War and also planned to hand over the gold deposited in French banks by the Spanish Republican government to Franco. The reactionaries in both Britain and France opposed the democratic government of Spain. As for General Weygand, he is also an extreme right-winger. Like Pétain, he has never participated in politics, but he strongly hopes for the fascistization of France. With the establishment of the Pétain-Weygand government, France surrendered to the German army and negotiated a shameful peace agreement. French people with self-respect and patriotism will never forget these facts. On the other hand, the Radical Socialist Party, representing the more moderate elements, unfortunately engaged in Spanish-style and Czech-style diplomacy and could not use their skills to prepare for continuing the war. Although the situation is as it is, the war has not ended. It is too early to talk about the consequences. Today, there is a common feeling among the existing democratic countries: those in power all know that they should awaken from their dreams. The German and Italian peace terms have been delivered to France and are reportedly very harsh. If they are very harsh, Pétain will probably refuse to sign. The United States has now begun a "new" experiment, with opposing parties simultaneously joining the government to deal with the urgent world situation. This is indeed an unprecedented creation and is of great interest here. In the last European war, both Britain and France had governments composed of opposing parties. However, in the United States, it is still a new fact. President Roosevelt's move is truly a demonstration of courage and has made a profound and positive impression on Britain.

<p>Rome: While awaiting the outcome of the peace negotiations between France and Germany in Compiègne, the Italian High Command yesterday concentrated all its efforts on the war in African colonies. With the imminent end of the Axis powers' war against France, Italy will focus entirely on Britain and its African territories. Most observers believe that French territories, such as French Somaliland, Tunisia, and Algeria, may be converted into armed zones within days. Italian aircraft have increased reconnaissance flights over Kenya and Somaliland in recent days. Yesterday's communiqué claimed that British forces attempted to break into Libya but encountered fierce resistance. The communiqué continued that during fierce fighting on Thursday, the British lost ten aircraft and forty armored vehicles. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>

During the bombing of the Fiat factory in Turin, the underground explosion caused flames to soar, and the pilots were lost in the smoke for several minutes. Fifteen minutes later, the British aircraft returned, aimed at the southern factory building, and dropped eight heavy bombs. At the same time, the Caproni aircraft factory in Turin and the important road hub north of the city were also heavily bombed. The northern branch of the Tislocson Sardo aircraft factory, located in the port of Genoa, was also hit by many British bombs, causing violent explosions. In addition, the Seftri-Ponente shipyard in Genoa, the Genoa port foundry, and an aircraft fuselage manufacturing factory near Milan were also bombed by British aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e19">If the Western Hemisphere is Invaded, the United States Will Resist; President Roosevelt Issues Statement on Addressing Difficulties Faced by Various Nations <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>New York – President Roosevelt, having been resting for several days at his Hyde Park estate on the Hudson River, will exert every effort to resist any actions invading the Western Hemisphere, whether economic or otherwise. President Roosevelt declared that the United States would actively address the difficult problems encountered by the nations of the Americas. This statement supports the proposal for an economic group of twenty-one American nations, designed to counter the barter system promoted by Hitler. President Roosevelt stated that as the European situation changes, the various measures the United States is taking are only part of an economic defense plan to supplement military defense. These measures are sufficient to safeguard the peace of the Western Hemisphere and are a means of preventing the United States and other American nations from being affected by the international situation. Roosevelt will immediately organize the American bloc and refute the notion that the surplus goods of South American countries, such as Argentine beef, will be dumped in the United States and compete with American goods in the market. He believes that the purpose of this economic bloc is to concentrate the surplus goods of the Western Hemisphere for sale in markets outside the Americas. (International News Service, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – Senator Nye stated in the Senate today that he would be surprised if former Secretary of War Woodring and his staff were questioned by the Military Affairs Committee and the proper questioning did not reveal that Woodring had been asked to hand over National Defense Secret Number One. Nye made this statement in response to Republican Senator Vandenberg's request that Woodring be asked to appear before the Senate committee to explain the reasons for his resignation. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – Due to opposition from Republican isolationists, discussion in the Senate on the new appointments of Stimson and Knox will be delayed for at least a week. Republicans claim that Roosevelt's appointment of Stimson as Secretary of War is tantamount to drawing the United States into the war. Republican Carlson requested that Congress investigate the reasons for Secretary of War Woodring's dismissal. According to Woodring's friends, his resignation was due to his opposition to US aid to the Allies. Woodring said, "I advocate strengthening US defense, but I oppose the US sending troops to Europe. They were very unhappy with me because I opposed sending troops three thousand miles away to fight Hitler. They will eventually force me to resign." Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, also stated that he opposed aiding the Allies and said he would rather resign than see the US drawn into the war.

<p>Washington – The claim that former Secretary of War Woodring had been asked to hand over National Defense Secret Number One (i.e., the US Army's secret bombing sight) was refuted in the Senate today by Senator Barkley of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<h3 id="e20">Stimson's and Others' Appointments Welcomed by China and Britain <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Official sources here recently expressed a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's appointment of Stimson as Secretary of War and Knox as Secretary of the Navy. Officials stated that Stimson, when he was the former US Secretary of State, was one of the most sympathetic friends of China, and that Stimson's actions in opposing Japanese aggression in 1931 were especially appreciated by China. Stimson is also one of the most famous Americans in China, because Stimson's sympathy for China is well known, and his book on American Far Eastern policy has been translated into Chinese and widely circulated. The Yishi Bao newspaper published an article stating that Stimson is a close friend of the Chinese nation. Stimson is the creator of the non-recognition doctrine and advocates British-American cooperation to restrain Japan. Knox's appointment as Secretary of the Navy is also very important. This appointment by the United States is sufficient to show the trend of future US foreign policy. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – The Times newspaper today published an article welcoming the new appointments of Stimson and Knox, stating that both are great and talented men. Regarding the dangers faced by the United States in this European war, no different from the Allies, the US government should provide the Allies with all possible assistance as quickly as possible, which is fulfilling its responsibility to its people. It frankly states that the issue of entering the war has not yet arisen. What the Allies immediately need from the United States is not soldiers, but aircraft, ships, tanks, and other munitions. The US government has already provided much of this assistance, and President Roosevelt has especially exhausted his ability to expand and accelerate it. Since the key positions in the War and Navy Departments have been given to members of the opposition party, the obvious difficulties encountered by these current efforts will surely eliminate many doubts. The opposition party has vastly different opinions from President Roosevelt on domestic issues, but also acknowledges that if Germany is victorious, the United States will be in danger. Both men often speak publicly far beyond what they now feel they can do. A few days ago, Stimson, in a speech somewhere, urged Americans to accelerate the transport of munitions to Britain and France with all their might, and if necessary, use American ships or send naval escorts.

<p>Rome – After Romania issued an order uniting all political parties into a single national party, the country has been transformed into a fully fledged totalitarian state.

The party's first prerogative will be to transform individual actions into the interests of the state. The comments of the Courantul newspaper can suggest the direction of Romanian policy, saying, "We are following a policy similar to that of the Axis powers, and our ties with the Axis powers are becoming increasingly close." Today, the authorities also issued an order to guarantee the political order of the new party. Anyone who propagates any changes to the national political system will be considered seditious. In addition, it was ordered that civil servants who are not members of the national party cannot hold office, and they must join the party by August 1. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – Yugoslav Prime Minister Svetozar Vuković stated to German news representatives yesterday that Yugoslavia's policy is to strive to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors in order to promote the active cooperation of the peoples of Southeastern Europe. Without this, the Danube basin cannot achieve prosperity. This policy is also in line with the sentiments of the Yugoslav people. Therefore, after the outbreak of the European war, the Yugoslav government immediately declared strict neutrality. This frank and honest attitude has greatly contributed to maintaining peace in this region. When Germany and Yugoslavia became neighbors, a spirit of friendly cooperation already existed between the two countries, especially in economic activities. Not only can the economic lives of the two countries benefit from mutual assistance, but Yugoslavia can also serve as a link between industrially underdeveloped Germany and the agricultural countries of the Near East, benefiting both sides. Svetozar Vuković's conclusion emphasized his determination to maintain good neighborly friendship with Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e25">British Prime Minister Churchill Reports on the War Situation (Continued) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Although there may be a risk of paratrooper attacks and soldiers transported by the Air Force attempting to land, we should give them a warm welcome in the air or after they have landed. However, the major issue at present is whether we can defeat Hitler's aerial weapons today. It is regrettable that we do not possess an Air Force that is at least equal to the enemy's, but we already have a very strong Air Force, which, in the many decisive battles experienced so far, has proven to be far superior to the enemy in terms of personnel and many aircraft types. Although we suffered great disadvantages in France and lost many aircraft in land airfields, the ratio of our losses to the enemy's has often been one to two or two and a half. In the Dunkirk battle, we undoubtedly defeated the German Air Force and controlled the local airspace. The ratio of our losses to the enemy's was one to two to four. Anyone who has read the photos published a week ago, seeing that entire groups of troops gathered on the beach could be the best target for enemy bombing, can understand that this evacuation and boarding could not have been carried out unless the enemy had abandoned all hope of restoring air superiority.</p>
<p>In terms of the defense of the island, the benefits of defense will be extremely great. We hope to improve on the loss ratio of one to three to four that was achieved at Dunkirk. In addition, the safe landing of all our wounded aircraft and their crew (a large number of aircraft and their crew do land safely in modern warfare) will be in our own territory, so they can live to fight another day, while all wounded enemy aircraft and their crew, in terms of the war, will be a complete loss.</p>
<p>During the French campaign, we provided the French army with continuous and powerful assistance with fighter planes and bombers, but despite all kinds of pressure, we never exhausted all the strength of our domestic air force fighter planes. This decision was truly painful, but it was also correct, because even if we devoted all our fighter planes, we would not have been able to make a substantial change in the fate of the French war. The failure of the French campaign was due to unfortunate strategic gaps, as well as the extraordinary and unexpected power of the enemy's armored units, and the large number of German troops. If our entire fighter squadron had joined, it would have easily exhausted its strength and become a common occurrence in this war. If so, we would see ourselves in a very dangerous situation now. I can happily tell the House that our fighter plane strength is now stronger compared to the heavily damaged German fighter plane strength than before. Our air force warriors will surely defend their homeland with the honor of resisting the most fierce air raids. We can foresee their great achievements. Enemy bombers will soon wreak havoc on our country, so the danger of enemy aircraft bombing still exists today. The number of enemy planes is indeed greater than ours, but we also have many bombers, which will be used to continuously attack military targets in Germany.</p>
<p>I do not ignore the seriousness of our current test, but I believe that the people of the country will be able to make an effort to overcome the difficulties, at least as much as any other people in the world. How the future unfolds depends on this. Every man and woman in our country will have the opportunity to show the best qualities of their nation and devote their best efforts to serving the country. At this time, all people in the country, regardless of their position, occupation, or responsibility, must remember the famous saying, "Do not leave a despicable act on the ever-memorable curtain."</p>
<p>I think it is appropriate today to briefly tell the House of Commons and the people of the country the reasons why we decided to continue the war. I can assure you that our naval, land, and air force experts all unanimously say that we should continue the war and say that there is a good and reasonable hope of final victory. (Cheers) We have also gained the full trust of the various overseas autonomous territories. (Cheers) The Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have all sent telegrams to me with extremely sincere words, approving of our decision and declaring their readiness to share weal and woe with us to the end.</p>
<p>We may now ask ourselves, why has our position deteriorated since the start of the war? It has deteriorated because Germany has occupied a large part of the West European coastline and many small countries have been destroyed by the German army. The possibility of air raids has thus increased, and the work of our navy has also increased. However, the power of our long-distance blockade has not weakened as a result, but has strengthened. It is not yet certain whether France will continue to resist, but its resistance will be greatly reduced regardless. If France does stop resisting, then Germany will concentrate its forces on us, but for the reasons I have stated, it is not easy for Germany to do this. If Germany wants to invade England immediately because of the French armistice, then we do not need to station a large army in France, and we can get a larger and more efficient force to meet it.</p>
<p>If Hitler can place the industries of the countries he has conquered under his tyrannical control, then the German production of war equipment will greatly increase as a result. However, this cannot be realized immediately, and we can now get a steady supply of large quantities of arms from the United States, and the autonomous territories and foreign countries have a supply of aircraft and pilots. All of these factors will benefit us before winter comes, while Germany will feel the hardships of winter, because almost all of Europe is groaning under the iron heel of the German army, and the hunger and cold will be detrimental to the German side.</p>
<p>We must not forget that from the time we declared war on September 3, 1939, Germany has always had the possibility of attacking Britain with its air force and other new weapons, which France could not prevent its air raids. Therefore, in these months, we have been in this danger every day, but we have greatly improved our defenses and know that our planes and pilots are better than the enemy's. Therefore, when I consider the danger of air raids with an open mind, I see the reason for extreme caution to prevent air raids, but I do not see any reason for panic or pessimism.</p>
<p>In the four years of the previous Great War, the Allies encountered almost nothing but disasters and disappointments in the first year. Lloyd George can recall this, but the morale of the Allied forces was ultimately higher than that of the German army, which had repeatedly won invasions. In the last war, we often asked ourselves how we could win. No one could answer it effectively at the time, but the terrifying enemy suddenly collapsed unexpectedly before us. (Cheers)</p>
<p>I do not yet know what will happen to France, nor do I know whether France will continue to resist within its own territory and in its overseas territories. We cannot allow the French government to be relieved of its treaty obligations. If the French government does not continue to fight in accordance with its treaty obligations, it will abandon a great opportunity and abandon its future. The House of Commons must have read our willingness to conclude a union of common peoples at the darkest period in French history. Regardless of what France or its government does, we in the British Isles and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of friendship for the French people. If we must now suffer what the French people have suffered, then we should imitate their courage and surpass it. If final victory rewards our labors, then the French people will have something to share in what they have gained and freedom will be restored to all parties.</p>
<p>We will not reduce our righteous demands. The people of the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, who once shared the same ideals with us, will all be restored to their former state. General Weygand's so-called French war has now passed. I expect the British war is about to begin. The survival of Christian civilization depends on this war, and the continuation of Britain's own life and its constitutional empire also depends on this.</p>
<p>All the enemy's ferocity and ability will inevitably soon shift to us. Hitler knows that he must defeat us on this island, or we will fail. If we can cope with it, then all of Europe can be free, and the world's life can be prosperous. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States and all that we cherish, will fall into the abyss of a new dark age, and this dark age may be made more cruel and prolonged by the abuse of science. Therefore, we must each do our duty now. We should know that in a thousand years after the British Empire, speakers will still say that today was our best period.</p>
<p>Smith, representing the Labour Party, said that the people of the country supported the Prime Minister unanimously and said that we must persevere to the end. Liberal Party Hailie Selassie spoke, praising Churchill's courageous remarks and great leadership. Lloyd George also spoke, declaring that he had no intention of wasting time looking back on the past, but advocated that in the secret meeting held on Thursday, there should be a very frank discussion of the current situation. Churchill replied that in the debate at the secret meeting, each Member could speak freely, but that national defense should be the focus of the discussion. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">New Emerging Nation in Central Europe: Romania in the Seam <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of Europe's strategy, the importance of Romania and Southeastern Europe lies in their ability to provide Germany with a passage under the Entente's blockade. The kerosene, wheat, rapeseed, and corn that Germany relies on for war come in large quantities from Romania.</p>
<p>For the people of Southeastern Europe who have a newfound national confidence, the issue is relatively simple. They understand very well that the current few years are enough to determine their way of life and all of their substance. They also know that they are powerless in the face of such major events. All they can do is try to avoid being caught in the crossfire between Germany and the Entente.</p>
<p>Even if Romania's fate does not occupy such an important position, even if Romania's oil and wheat are not strategically important, the situation of this emerging country is worth our attention. Because Romania stands at a crossroads; one direction is a great future, and the other is towards a position of extreme insignificance.</p>
<p>Within Romania's borders, from the Black Sea to Transylvania in the west, from the Carpathian Mountains to the Danube River, there are nearly ten million hardworking farmers. These people live in the most fertile land in the world, comparable to the black earth belt of southern Russia, and beneath this soil, one day, may be found mineral deposits even richer than those already known in Europe. Regardless of the situation of this country today, wartime Europe will naturally pay attention to this fact.</p>
<p>Romania is the world's newest country. The meaning of "new" refers to the stage of its development. Its nation is in the process of unifying its language and customs, its capital is consciously imitating Paris, absorbing its vulgarity but little of its strength, and its ruling methods are outdated rather than modern. What Romania needs more than anything is time, and time is precisely a condition they cannot control.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the war sent Romania into a boundless middle stream. Now, eight months have passed, and the only hope of Romania's rulers is to steer their drifting boat into the safe harbor of neutrality. But the storm of war is blowing harder and harder, and the safe harbor of neutrality is no closer than it was before August. There are already signs of a slight misfortune, as if the boatmen have lost their resolve. The strategies of the nations should take these facts into consideration. Their inevitable path is to oppose Germany by launching another storm of similar force from the opposite direction; if the Entente does so, they understand that they risk sinking this valuable vessel before it reaches port, and sinking its rich cargo before Germany can seize it.</p>
<p>No fact illustrates this situation better than the news of Romania's kerosene production. Through determined negotiations, Germany has secured a treaty to supply Romania with 5,000,000 tons of kerosene annually. This quantity seems impossible to transport in practice unless German engineers spend several years improving transportation in Southeastern Europe; Germany's agents have been extremely successful in acquiring control of several oil concession purchases. These people make Romania aware that Germany needs more than Romania can deliver.</p>
<p>We cannot say for sure; everything depends on the courage and ability of Romania's rulers. At most, we can say that the Romanian army and its officers are better than they were five years ago, but still not as good as they should be. King Carol is doing his best to improve the standards of his officers; in this regard, he needs more time. If Romania's situation reaches the military stage, then only the more powerful participating nations will have the final say. The struggle is limited to diplomatic and commercial aspects.</p>
<p>Romanian territory will have irresistible power, and Romania is striving to move in this direction.</p>
<p>Romania is ruled by a king whose father was of German royalty and whose mother was of Scottish nobility; he possesses several traits from both sides. He is brave, stubborn, thrifty, fierce, loyal to his ambitions, smarter than his subjects, and what represents his personality even more is his reckless spirit. If Romania falls, all hope for Carol and his dynasty will fall with it.</p>
<p>There is a notable similarity in Carol's domestic and foreign policies. Since he returned from Paris by plane ten years ago to take power, he has had to continue plotting and scheming with the politicians he commands, until after 1938, he could consider himself the undisputed ruler of Romania.</p>
<p>For many years, he has been playing this clever policy of power balance, uniting one faction to overthrow another, gradually removing important figures, until he can appoint people to assist him in governance.</p>
<p>In foreign policy, Carol is also playing this game of power balance. If he has had little success in this game, it is because many factors are beyond his control. If no war had broken out, he would have had nothing to fear for his future.</p>
<p>His goal is to include some members of the Iron Guard in the government. Those who say that this gesture is aimed at Germany misunderstand Carol's motives. On the contrary, this is a further action to remove the power of the opposition party. Since the suppression of the Iron Guard, public opinion in Bucharest and elsewhere has secretly expressed fear, because every Romanian has suffered greatly from the constant changes in the political environment and has little hope for the future.</p>
<p>Romania in the spring of 1940 is calm, yet somewhat apprehensive. Most of the army has been mobilized, weapons are flowing in from Germany, Italy, and the Entente, and diplomacy maintains a cunning attitude. With an attitude that what is gained will not be much, and what is lost will not be much, Romania's rulers hope that these reserved attitudes can weather the war. Undoubtedly, they will skillfully utilize these reserved attitudes as long as they can. (Translated from the New York Times)</p>
<h3 id="e27">National Cultural Academy: School Buildings Fully Completed, Preparations Ready for Autumn Semester <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang advocated the establishment of the "National Cultural Academy," appointing Mr. Zhang Junmai as president, to cultivate talent for the future revival of culture. The Central Authorities have allocated 100,000 national currency units to construct school buildings in Caicun, Dali, Yunnan. Now, all buildings have been completed. The arrangement of other school affairs has been largely completed since preparations began last year. The formal opening of the school will begin in the autumn semester of this year. President Zhang has arrived in Dali from Chongqing to preside over everything. Professors Luo Wengan, Luo Nusheng, Wu Wenzao, and many others have also arrived at the school. There are a total of eight school sites that have been built, with a fairly grand scale. The scenery near Dali is very beautiful, so it is quite suitable for running a school. It is believed that in the future, many schools will move here one after another. It is heard that the houses of the Faculty of Arts and Law of the Southwest Associated University in Kunming have been taken back by the owners and sublet to other agencies for office use. Therefore, there may be a possibility of moving to Dali for the opening of the school. Regarding the student aspect of the Cultural Academy, the results of the recruitment examinations conducted in Chongqing, Kunming, Hong Kong, and other places over a period of three months have resulted in more than one hundred students having already reported to the school. Among them, there are more than ten students from Hong Kong. As for whether or not to hold a second recruitment examination, it has not yet been determined. The school's library has a fairly rich collection due to enthusiastic donations from all parties. The largest batch includes three parts donated by Gu Weijun, Zheng Tianxi, and a German. In addition, the school sent people to Peiping last year to purchase various books that had been lost from previous schools, the number of which is also quite considerable. The professors hired by the academy are mostly well-known scholars in the country. The Department of Classics has Peng Yunsheng, Gao Jinsheng, and Meng Wentong; the Department of History has Gu Jiegang, Hu Ziqing, Wu Qichang, Zhang Guiyong, Weng Dujian, Chen Qingqi, and the German historian Fritslan; the Department of Sociology has Luo Wengan, Luo Nusheng, Huang Yinlai, Pan Guangdan, and Wu Wenzao; the Department of Philosophy has Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongsun, Shi Youzhong, Xiong Shili, and Xi Yunbo, and many others. All professors will go to the school in Dali during the summer vacation to arrange various teaching courses in advance. In the future, the teaching method of the school will adopt a tutorial system, with each professor leading six or seven students respectively, so that students' academic articles and research can be guided at any time, and their personal and mental cultivation can also be followed.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Airmail News) The Ministry of Education is in charge of the unified enrollment of freshmen in the second grade of national and provincial universities and independent colleges in the 29th academic year. Overseas Chinese students will still be admitted leniently. However, there are detailed regulations for their registration procedures, which are recorded as follows: (1) Overseas Chinese students returning to China for further studies should obtain a certificate from the local consulate of their home country, fill out a resume, fill in their name, gender, age, native place, unified enrollment examination area (which cannot be changed after filling in), and the school address they wish to attend. Before the unified enrollment registration period, the application should be submitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for review. Those who pass the review by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will be given a certificate. The overseas Chinese students who have passed the review by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission should submit the certificate issued by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to the registration office when registering for unified enrollment, and order to indicate the words "Overseas Chinese Students" in the examination column of the registration form. (2) By the deadline for unified enrollment registration (July 16 of this year), the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will compile a list of qualified overseas Chinese students according to the information filled in on their resumes and send it to the Ministry of Education, which will then send it to the Unified Enrollment Committee of public colleges and universities for processing.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Airmail News) The preliminary examination of this year's Higher Examination is being actively planned by the Examination Yuan. However, financial personnel are particularly urgently needed. It is proposed to hold the examination simultaneously in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, Yongkang, and other places in late July.

The first month will be training by the Party and Government Training Class. After the training period, the examiners will hold a re-examination. Those who pass the re-examination will be assigned to the Ministry of Finance and the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture for employment. Those with excellent grades or above will be employed in a senior-level position or its equivalent. Those with medium grades will first be employed in a junior-level position or its equivalent. During their training period at the Central Political School, in addition to the provision of food, accommodation, clothing, and lecture notes by the school, each person will receive a monthly allowance of 30 yuan. It is also heard that the quota for the preliminary examination has been set at 200, but it may be increased or decreased according to their examination results.</p>

<h3 id="e40">German Government and Public Sympathize with China, Unwilling for Japan to Dominate the Far East: German Overseas Chinese with Good Reputation Express Their Opinions, Shanghai Situation Continues to Stabilize <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>According to a certain German gentleman residing in this city, who has a great reputation, the friendly relations between China and Germany have always been close. Although Germany is involved in Europe, it has never forgotten the evolution of the situation in the Far East, and expresses unlimited admiration for China's spirit of persevering and fighting in the Anti-Japanese War over the past year. Therefore, the German government and public can empathize with China and continuously provide material assistance. The maintenance of the status quo in the Far East depends on the United States. Therefore, despite various difficulties, the US authorities will be able to respond resolutely with great efforts. Moreover, German leader Hitler has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of attacking the United States. Wei Gang believes that Germany is currently capable of breaking the Monroe Doctrine of the United States, but Hitler has denied this, believing that this is a fantasy of Wei Gang. In short, no matter how the European situation evolves, Germany will always sympathize with China's current situation. Therefore, Germany also supports the US Far East policy. Germany does not want Japan to take advantage of the "non-intervention in the European war" policy to promote Japan's aggression in the Far East and dominate East Asia. Therefore, its attitude is very clear.</p>
<p>Demand for Withdrawal of Troops: No Results. According to sources close to the concession authorities, the situation in Shanghai has stabilized, and there is no other incident that could cause misfortune. As for the former puppet mayor Fu Xiao'an's request for the withdrawal of defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, the British and French authorities have firmly stated that they will not withdraw the defense forces stationed in Shanghai. The British and French consuls have ignored Fu's unreasonable "request." According to yesterday's English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Italian Consul General Lieutenant Colonel Naroni submitted a reply on the 22nd to Chuan Xiao'an's request to withdraw the British, French, and Italian troops stationed here, saying that this request had been submitted to the Royal Italian Embassy, "undoubtedly, the embassy will convey it to the government in Rome." The humor in his wording can be imagined.</p>
<p>Situation in Western Shanghai: Improving Daily. Yesterday, there were rumors that puppet troops were coming to Shanghai, causing the situation in western Shanghai to become tense again. In order to understand the real situation in western Shanghai, the reporter went to the area of the cross-border roads of Shanghai yesterday afternoon and saw that everything was as usual. Concession police were patrolling back and forth, and there was no tension. Residents were also calm. Although the puppet police who were stationed were still facing each other with guns, there was no tense atmosphere. In addition, there was a small dispute between the puppet police and the French Concession police on the border of the refugee area of the Xujiahui Tushanwan Cathedral, which was quickly resolved. At that time, the situation in that area was slightly tense. The reporter also went to the area yesterday and saw that the Japanese sentries along the Hongqiao Road border had been reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Italian Ships Sailing on Shanghai-Wenzhou Line: Italian Consulate Orders Suspension of Navigation, Reasons for Refusal to Issue Export Permits Unknown <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since Italy's official participation in the war, Italian merchant ships sailing along the Chinese coast, such as the De Pingchangde on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and the Baoli on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, have continued to operate normally, in accordance with the provisions of international law that no hostile actions may be taken within 300 nautical miles of the coast of a neutral country. However, the Italian Consulate in Shanghai recently ordered the suspension of navigation for Italian ships sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As a result, the ships have suspended exports. In addition, the Ender and other four ships of the Sino-Italian Company have been repaired, but the resumption of navigation is uncertain. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspension of Exports</p>
<p>The reporter of Daguan News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai recently suddenly notified various Italian shipping companies to prohibit ships sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line and refused to issue export permits. The reason is unknown. The Baoli ship of the Yihua Foreign Company was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou on the 11th, but had to suspend navigation temporarily and suspend exports after receiving the order. However, other German and British ships are still sailing as usual. In addition, the Italian ship De Pingchangde is also sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line as usual and has not suspended navigation.</p>
<p>Four Ships Stranded in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Daguan News Agency, the Ender, Enji, Badula, and Kangshayi, four ships of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company on Wuma Road in this city, sailed into the Nanshi blockade line before Italy's participation in the war and entered the company's own shipyard for repairs. They have now been repaired and were originally scheduled to resume navigation. However, due to Italy's participation in the war, and because these ships have always sailed on the South China line, it is impossible to resume navigation for a while. They are currently anchored in Nanshi.</p>

<p>Since the British and French ambassadors arrived in Shanghai one after another, their work has been very busy due to the impact of the European war. As for the date of the two ambassadors' trip north to avoid the heat, according to the reporter of Pingming News Agency's inquiry from various parties yesterday, British Ambassador Sir Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme have not yet determined the exact date of their trip north as of yesterday. According to Baekeland's inquiry from the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday, the date of US Ambassador Johnson's return to Shanghai, according to the US Consul General Bartlett, although there have been repeated rumors that the US Ambassador has a scheduled return to Shanghai, the US Consulate in this city has not received any news that the Ambassador will leave Chongqing and return to Shanghai. As for the rumors that the consular corps is discussing the so-called "free city of the sea," he had no knowledge of it and it was not true.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Sichuan Business Public Welfare Association, reports that goods from Shanghai-based national product manufacturers operated by Sichuan merchants are often detained by inspection agencies for more than half a year without being released. The Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a telegram to the Finance and Economic Ministries, requesting that the goods be released swiftly.</p>

<p>According to the English-language China Press, a Japanese source claims that the Italian liners Conte Verde and Conte Biancamano, of 13,000 tons each, moored at pontoons No. 16 and 17 in the Huangpu River since Italy entered the war, may be converted into floating hotels for Italian émigrés relocating from the International and French Concessions. The ships' captains are currently seeking to lease a pier owned by a neutral country's merchant to begin operations. The captains' decision to pursue this new plan stems from their fear that if the liners leave Shanghai, they will be seized by British and French warships. Furthermore, chartering them to a neutral nation is prohibited by international law.</p>

<p>The second fundraising convention for Ningbo native place famine relief donations was held yesterday at 4:00 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Over 500 Ningbo compatriots attended, and Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, and Zhang Jiguang were publicly elected as the presidium.</p>

<p>Wang Boyuan reported on the donation amounts, stating that as of the 2nd, a total of 1,083,000 yuan had been raised, of which 870,000 yuan had already been received. He urged all those who had pledged to donate but not yet paid to do so promptly, and those who had not yet paid in full to complete their payments as soon as possible in order to clear procedures and facilitate the overall plan. Regarding industry-specific pledges, the hardware industry pledged 85,080 yuan, the cotton fabric industry pledged 49,450 yuan, and over 30 other companies in the new medicine, cotton, and iron industries pledged a total of over 300,000 yuan. On the private side, Yu Qiaqing and others generously donated large sums, with Yu Qiaqing personally donating 100,000 yuan, and Yu Qiaqing raising 100,030 yuan, and Qin Runqing raising 77,034 yuan. In addition, approximately 100,000 yuan was pledged on the spot yesterday, including 30,000 yuan from the coal industry. It is understood that another 300,000 yuan in pledges was made yesterday, bringing the total, including the original 1,080,000 yuan, to over 1,400,000 yuan. It is expected that the target of two million yuan will be easily met within days.</p>
<p>Levying Flat-Rate Grain Relief Donations</p>
<p>At the end, the methods of conducting the fundraising were discussed. Someone proposed that, similar to the methods used by the [Refugee] Relief Association for collecting refugee donations, a flat-rate donation be levied on all Ningbo natives engaged in various industries in Shanghai. This was passed. The assembly also decided to convene the third fundraising convention at 4:00 PM on July 6th, and adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Japanese Urges Foreign Residents in Chongqing to Evacuate, All Countries Ignore, Never Acknowledged Japanese Right to Bomb <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>According to news from Chongqing received by diplomatic circles in this city, since Japanese planes have been frequently flying over and indiscriminately bombing Chongqing, the Japanese have made a "recommendation" requesting the evacuation of foreign residents in Chongqing from third countries. However, the foreign residents currently staying in Chongqing have ignored this and have not accepted relocation to the "safe area" designated by the Japanese on the south bank of the Yangtze River. All embassies are also operating as usual. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Firm Stance</p>
<p>Currently, all embassies in Chongqing are continuing to operate as usual. The British, French, and German embassies in Consular Lane, the American embassy in Guanzigang, the Italian embassy in Mei Yuan in Shangqingsi, and the Belgian embassy in Niujiaotuo have not relocated and have ignored the Japanese "recommendation". The diplomatic guesthouse at Lianglukou and Luojiawan Feilai Temple is also continuing to receive foreign guests. The United States and other countries have never recognized Japan's right to bomb Chongqing or the "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze River designated by the Japanese.</p>
<p>French and Soviet Embassies</p>
<p>Although the French embassy has recently made preparations to relocate from Consular Lane to the south bank, it has been learned that the relocation of the French embassy is by no means an acceptance of the Japanese notice of evacuation for foreign officials and civilians. The continuous bombing of Chongqing has affected the embassy's operations, and to avoid this disturbance, they are voluntarily relocating. It is also understood that after the Soviet embassy was bombed by Japanese planes, it has now relocated and is operating from a new site. The American embassy has also repaired the glass and other damage caused by the bombing.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Remain in Chongqing</p>
<p>Most of the foreign nationals residing in Chongqing are from the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, followed by France, Italy, and Belgium. Most of them work in political institutions such as embassies or are engaged in business. A small number are missionaries. They reside near their respective embassies and are unable to leave Chongqing due to their work. The air raid shelters set up by the Chongqing Air Defense Command are sufficient to protect the safety of foreign nationals. Therefore, they have ignored the Japanese "evacuation recommendation" and continue to reside as usual. Foreigners in this city have not received telegrams from relatives and friends to relocate.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Jewish Residents of This City Zealously Support Britain's War Effort, Eager to Organize a Jewish Army, Leaders of Both Parties Make Eloquent Statements <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>It was suddenly reported in this city yesterday that the Zionist Alliance is willing to organize a Jewish army to join the Allied Powers and assist in the war effort. The Russian Jewish community in this city was very excited upon hearing this news. According to leaders of various Jewish organizations in Shanghai, if the British government approves this proposal, all Jewish people in this city of military age will immediately enlist. It is noted that there are two Zionist parties, old and new, with branches in Shanghai. It is claimed that among the Russian Jewish party members in China, there are at least a thousand who have received years of military training and can proceed to Europe.</p>
<p>Better to Die Fighting than to Live in Suffering</p>
<p>The leader of the old party's Shanghai branch, Mr. Torpus, declared, "Civilization is currently facing a crisis." When he spoke of the news that Italy had launched a major arrest of Jewish people, he said, "It is better for us to die a glorious death than to live in suffering." The leader of the new party, Mr. Beck, also said, "The Jewish people in China must join immediately." Both leaders expressed heartache over the news of Jewish people being arrested in Palestine. Mr. Beck said, "This is very sad. What more can I say?"</p>
<p>If There is an Opportunity, We Would Gladly Enlist</p>
<p>Mr. Torpus said, "We Jewish people are accustomed to suffering." He also said, "We have suffered for three thousand years. The Jewish people of Central Europe have practically lost half their numbers because, although their bodies are well, their spirits are dead. Most of them will disappear without a trace from now on. If we have the opportunity, we would gladly fight, but we will not only fight for ourselves, but for world civilization. If we allow it to collapse, it will not only be Jewish people who suffer.</p>
<p>Young Russians Eagerly Enlist</p>
<p>In the past, people have not been concerned about the interests of the Jewish people, so we were unwilling to fight for Britain, but we have heard that where British power is strongest, other people have equal opportunities in life. For this reason, Jewish people today sympathize with Britain, and Britain will surely be victorious. Although the situation seems dark now, a year from today there will be a completely different change." It is claimed that most of the young Russian Jewish people here have already registered with Zionist organizations. The aim of this organization is to take back Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people at any cost.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Satisfactory Outcome, Huang Yuqi Enthusiastically Provides Assistance, First Batch of Four Tons Issued <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Since this spring, coal prices in this city have soared, causing great anxiety for various industries that use coal, especially the bathing industry. The chairman of the industry association, Mr. Huang Yuqi, believed that if the bathing industry was threatened and had to shut down, it would not only create a public health problem for the entire city but would also affect the social stability of over ten thousand unemployed workers. Although Mr. Huang works in the financial sector, he could not stand by and watch the bathing industry face ruin. Therefore, a month ago, he consulted with Yu Qiaqing and Xu Jili and invited several giants of the coal industry to assist. All of them generously agreed. They held a meeting to discuss the matter and appointed Hou Shaoan, Xu Changqing, He Yanjun, and Chen Hanzhang as representatives to approach the Coal Industry Association and the Kailuan Mining Bureau, Jingyi Taixing, Yuantai, Huazhong and other major coal companies to seek supply. After much effort, they were also understood and sympathized with. After two months of hard work, a satisfactory outcome was finally achieved a few days ago. The association received a letter from the Coal Industry Association yesterday, (omitted) stating, "Your industry's request for cheap coal has been negotiated. According to the roster provided, each household will be sold two tons of Kailuan No. 3 coal fines per month at a fixed price of 55 yuan in legal tender per ton. The total of four tons for May and June will be issued first.

<h3 id="e51">Memorial Service for Former Chief of the Local Court, Luo Wushen, to Be Held on the 23rd of This Month <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>After the death of Mr. Luo Wushen, former chief of the local court, in Chongqing, prominent figures such as Xu Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, and Shan Yuhua, remembering his decades of service and lifelong integrity, deemed him a model for the judicial community. Therefore, they chose to hold a memorial service at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 1:00 PM on June 23 of the Gregorian calendar. An excerpt from his announcement is quoted below: "To whom it may concern, the late Mr. Luo Wushen, former chief of the Shanghai Local Court, was well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning and highly respected in the North and South. Mr. Luo served as an official for decades and was generous and charitable in his daily life. Most of his salary was used to assist relatives and friends, so he remained of upright character and suffered from stomach asthma and athlete's foot. When the Shanghai War broke out, Mr. Luo had just retired from his position in Yichang and came to Shanghai, where he closed his doors to recuperate and did not participate in external affairs for more than two years. Mr. Luo was not good at business, so his daily life had become difficult. Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather and factions are divided. There are many people who push and pull and try to win over others. Mr. Luo was well-educated and, although he had experienced difficulties, always valued morality and never wavered. Director Cheng of the Northwest Headquarters repeatedly sent telegrams to invite him to work together. Before his departure, relatives and friends helped him raise travel expenses, and he set off alone on December 21 of the Republic of China's 28th year. On the way to Yunnan via Vietnam, he tragically suffered three bombings. Although he fainted once, he finally arrived in Kunming after many hardships. Friends helped him buy a ticket, and he flew to Chongqing on January 5 of the 29th year. Unexpectedly, a telegram arrived on January 26th, stating that Mr. Luo had passed away at the Chongqing Renji Hospital. We are deeply saddened. Currently, the coffin is in Chongqing and will be returned to his hometown for burial in the future, which will require a considerable sum of money. Moreover, the dead are gone, and how can the living endure? When Mr. Luo left, his luggage was sparse, and there was no money left at home. The livelihood of his family is also a matter of importance. We believe that it is our human duty to help those in need, and we plan to launch a memorial service in Shanghai. All expenses for the burial of the coffin and the livelihood of the family should be raised and planned appropriately to comfort Mr. Luo Wushen's spirit in heaven. All of us should be generous and assist with the spirit of helping those in need. If you would like to donate an eulogy or a wreath, please write on plain paper so that it can be compiled into a booklet for permanent memorial. Because the funds for the coffin and settling the family are indeed vast, we hope that all the expenses for wreaths and couplets will be given in cash, and we also ask for special donations to fulfill this grand wish. We are deeply grateful. Donations can be made to the Bank of Agriculture and Industry on Sanma Road, Henan Road. Wreaths and couplets can be sent to the Shanghai Yu Qiaqing Ningbo Native Place Association Preparation Office.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Foreign Rice Enters Shanghai Without Obstruction, Noodle Makers Request Flour Allocation Based on Factory List Price <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating that the recent surge in rice prices is very intense. Although the reasons for the surge are not limited to one, the recent news of Hong Kong's ban on exports is a major cause. The association's members had previously purchased over 100,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. This ban on exports has not only prevented the rice that has already been purchased from being shipped, but will also make it impossible to continue ordering in the future. Although rice can still be shipped from Siam and Annam, the sources from Hong Kong have been cut off from now on. The market has been panicked and people are extremely agitated. If measures are not taken quickly to dredge the situation, it is feared that the surge will be difficult to suppress. It is hoped that every effort will be made to dredge the situation so that the source of food for the Shanghai citizens will not be interrupted. According to external sources, the arrival of rice from Hong Kong has been very strong recently. Although rice from Saigon is very scarce, it still arrives steadily. Over 50,000 bags have left the port and arrived in Shanghai this week.</p>
<p>Inspection and Informing</p>
<p>The resolution to strictly implement the proposal to pay for goods based on the "five-dog" price (a slang term for high prices), and to prevent reselling, was discussed and passed. At the same time, members are encouraged to report and inform on violations, and to strictly punish them. All members have been notified and will be implemented soon. Yesterday morning, the rice market was quiet, and the market price of various goods tended to ease. It is also understood that the Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee plans to continue to telegraph to foreign countries to purchase 40,000 bags of rice. However, 30% of the price of this rice must be paid in advance. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively donate.</p>
<p>Requesting Flour Allocation</p>
<p>The Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association submitted a petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "We are submitting this petition to request relief from the flour panic. Because manufacturers are unable to freely transport raw materials, the amount of flour has decreased, and the prices of each flour mill vary. It is difficult for members to purchase goods from each mill, or even be cut off. Recently, rice prices have soared, and ordinary people rely on noodles to fill their stomachs. Members have no goods to make, and thus no noodles to supply to the market. Members have come to the association one after another to make requests. The association immediately held a meeting and decided to petition your association to request relief from the authorities. Previously, we were introduced by your association to be supplied with 500 bags per day by the manufacturers. There is too little porridge for too many monks, and it is not enough to allocate. The association has discussed it again and again, and in order not to harm the interests of each flour mill, a handling fee of 3 cents is added to the factory list price. The association notifies members to register and then issues vouchers for purchasing goods from nearby flour mills, so as to avoid the mills making excuses and to facilitate both parties and avoid the difficulty of being cut off. We have no choice but to request your association to forward the request to the Municipal Council, to notify the factory and each flour mill to facilitate business and stabilize the market."</p>

<p>The case of Shen Yongkang, the general manager of the Dafang Hotel in Zhengjia Muqiao, embezzling 5,000 to 6,000 yuan in refugee donations, has been discovered, and the association is about to file a public prosecution. It is now understood that Shen Yongkang is aware that he is in the wrong. After mediation, there is hope for a settlement: (1) the embezzled funds should be returned in full; (2) a fine of 5,000 yuan should be paid to deter others; and (3) an apology should be published in the newspaper. Shen Yongkang has fully agreed, but it has been opposed by all the shareholders of the hotel, because the fine and compensation should be borne by Shen Yongkang personally. Therefore, the hope for a settlement has been temporarily shelved. It is unknown how it will end in the future.</p>

<p>Today is the 74th birthday of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leading figure in industry and commerce in this city. All walks of life in this city, because Yu has benefited the society and contributed to people's livelihood, originally wanted to raise a glass to congratulate him, but because it is a time of emergency, there are no ostentatious ceremonies except for a few close friends and relatives who congratulate him. Although Yu has reached an advanced age, because of his daily life</p>
<p>Strict Adherence to Rules</p>
<p>His daily life and diet are in accordance with the principles of hygiene, so he is energetic and healthy, without the dragon-like appearance of the average elderly. Yu is quite talkative, and he talks a lot about people's livelihood and welfare. When the reporter visited yesterday, it was said that the city has recently had a</p>
<p>Sharp Rise in Rice Prices</p>
<p>The extent is unprecedented in history. In previous years, this city has also experienced high rice prices due to several famines, but the highest price per picul was only 16 or 17 yuan, which is a surprisingly different multiple compared to the current situation. Although there are reasons for the recent surge in rice prices, the rapid increase has clearly deviated from the general</p>
<p>Natural Trend</p>
<p>Because there is still a lot of rice in stock in this city, there is no cause for panic. Therefore, I deeply hope that ordinary merchants should understand the difficulties of the people and should not excessively raise prices, causing countless compatriots to feel the pain of having nothing to eat. As for the price stabilization matter, Yu said that he is currently raising funds and it can be implemented in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Our Newspaper Readers Assist Mr. Liu with Tuition Fees: Compassionate Individuals Eagerly Donate Funds, Education Authorities Thoroughly Investigate the Truth of the Case <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Shusheng, a native of Ningbo, resides at No. 167 Jinyu Lane, Mintini Yin Road, and currently works as a street performer playing traditional Chinese music. He has two daughters: the elder, Fengying (15 years old), and the younger, Yunying (12 years old), both studying at Zhendong Elementary School, located at the intersection of Glock Road and Pi Shao Nai Road. The two students are naturally intelligent and always rank first in every exam. However, due to the impact of the war, Mr. Liu's situation is exceptionally dire, leaving him unable to pay the 21 yuan tuition fee for his two daughters. As a result, the school's principal, Fan Shenxiong, provided a guarantee to the Special Second Court, requesting a provisional attachment. A court hearing was held the day before yesterday. Upon reading this news, Mr. Guo Pengfei, a reader of this newspaper, was deeply moved and wished to contribute 11 yuan towards the tuition fees. Simultaneously, Principal Fan Shenxiong and a commissioned lawyer sent letters stating the details of the matter, claiming to have a clear conscience. All of this was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the disclosure of this news, society has not lacked compassionate individuals, who have eagerly entrusted this newspaper with donations. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guo Pengfei Takes the Lead in Sponsoring</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Pengfei, who first advocated assisting with the tuition fees, personally visited this newspaper at around 8 o'clock last night. He was received by a reporter from this newspaper. According to Mr. Guo, he himself was unable to study as a child due to family circumstances and suffered the same hardships. Although his current situation is not wealthy, driven by righteous indignation, he would rather gather this sum and requested that it be forwarded. As he spoke, he took out 11 yuan. Upon receiving the donation, the reporter expressed deep respect.</p>
<p>Compassionate Individuals Respond in Succession</p>
<p>Since this newspaper revealed the above news yesterday morning, an anonymous reader sent 40 yuan with a letter, stating that they did not wish to seek fame or praise, but expressed concern for some young compatriots who have lost the opportunity to study. Therefore, they gathered this sum as a gift. Mr. Cheng Fulin wrote, stating that pursuing tuition fee recovery through litigation is a strange occurrence in an isolated island and is truly shameful, also contributing 10 gold. In addition, Mr. Pu Qiting contributed 10 yuan, and an anonymous reader contributed 10 yuan, totaling 70 yuan. Combined with the 11 yuan personally sent by Mr. Guo Pengfei, the total is 81 yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Receives the Funds and Issues a Receipt</p>
<p>After receiving the aforementioned funds, this newspaper immediately sent personnel to Mr. Liu Shusheng's residence to have him come to the newspaper office to collect them. According to him, after this newspaper published the news, compassionate individuals offered assistance, for which he felt deeply grateful. He vowed to carefully preserve the received funds and use them exclusively for the education of his two daughters. This newspaper then requested him to write an official receipt, which is reproduced here for credibility. Mr. Liu's father stated that Mr. Zhang Yezhi, a local comedian and playwright, had sent a representative, Gu Mengchi, with 21 yuan in cash on the morning of the day before yesterday (21st) to subsidize the tuition fees, which was truly commendable. Furthermore, three elementary school students came to the newspaper office and wished to donate their funds for cakes and snacks to little friends who are unable to study. They were informed that Mr. Liu had already received some funds, sufficient for several semesters of schooling, and that they did not need to donate any further. The three elementary school students then left joyfully.</p>
<p>All Schools Should Universally Establish Scholarships</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the readers of this newspaper possess a strong sense of chivalry and enthusiasm. It is hoped that this spirit can be upheld and applied to various endeavors, so that the entire society may benefit from it. Furthermore, this newspaper considers the issue of Mr. Liu's tuition fees to be concluded. If there are any other enthusiastic individuals willing to assist impoverished students, they may wish to select schools that are dedicated to education and discuss establishing scholarships to benefit all impoverished students in the city.</p>
<p>Education Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>According to a report from the Dihua News Agency, relevant authorities in the municipal education administration believe that pursuing tuition fee recovery through litigation is inappropriate and have dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth of the matter for verification. It is hoped that the education authorities will handle the matter impartially in order to rectify discipline.</p>
<p>Shuping Elementary School Wishes to Cultivate</p>
<p>The General Administration Office of Shuping Free Elementary School, located at No. of North Suzhou Road in this city, sent a letter stating (excerpt omitted). After reading the news segment, the office expresses deep sympathy for Mr. Liu's difficult situation and deep admiration for Mr. Guo's enthusiastic assistance. The office has always had the desire to assist and cultivate young, studious children from impoverished families who are unable to pursue education. If Mr. Liu's two daughters achieve a total average score of 85 or above in the school's final exam this semester and wish to continue their studies next semester but are unable to afford the tuition fees, the office is willing to subsidize their tuition fees and book fees for the next semester to enable them to pursue further education. Regarding the aforementioned tuition fees owed by Mr. Liu, the office is also happy to pay them on his behalf. A special letter is sent to inform you of this matter. It is hoped that Mr. Liu can be informed to bring the report cards of his two daughters' final exams this semester to the office for a face-to-face discussion.</p>

<p>The whereabouts of Yao Changmin, Chinese detective No. 219 of the Jing'an Temple Precinct of the Public Concession, who has been missing for many days, have been of great concern to the public. The He Police Department has now learned of his whereabouts. It is neither a kidnapping nor a disappearance. Someone filed a lawsuit against him in the pseudo-"court" in Western Shanghai, and he was arrested by the pseudo-"bailiffs." He is currently under "secret detention" for investigation. Therefore, witnesses at the time stated that Detective Yao was taken away by four Chinese men wearing uniforms. In fact, the men in uniforms were the pseudo-"bailiffs."</p>

<p>Chen Xinji, a native of Jiading, is 27 years old and the son of Chen Jiruo, a tycoon in the tea shop business. He owns as many as seven famous tea shops, including Laoda Fang, Tianlu, and Yeziqi. He currently serves as the accountant at the Yeziqi branch at No. 541 Xiwusi Road, Xiafei Road. In the first month of the Republic of China year 20, he married Cao Junying (resident of No. 1, Mingde Lane, Ladu Road), a fellow native of the same age, and they have had</p>
<p>One Son, One Daughter</p>
<p>The son is named Huizhong (5 years old), and the daughter is named Huihua (3 years old). The relationship between husband and wife is still harmonious. However, Chen is pampered and enjoys a comfortable life. He frequently visits singing and dancing venues, leading to an inextricable relationship with a dancer named Lu Yingxia (also known as Qi Pei, 25 years old, a native of Guangdong, resident of No. 322 Wenlin Road, whose father works for a certain business company). He then rented a house to hide her in the overhanging building at No. 7 Shanqingfang, Kangti Road, and provided her with clothing and footwear worth no less than several thousand yuan. From then on, he treated his loyal wife</p>
<p>As Worn-Out Shoes</p>
<p>And neglected the living expenses of his children. Therefore, Cao once filed a lawsuit against Chen in the Civil Mediation Office of the Special Court for cohabitation and payment of 100 yuan per month for living expenses. As a result, Chen lacked sincerity, and mediation failed. Recently, Chen has been avoiding meeting and has not visited his wife at all. Cao then went around asking people to investigate her husband's whereabouts and learned that he had another lover. On the 15th of this month, at 6:30 a.m., she, accompanied by lawyers Yuan Hanyun and Wu Xiaolin, reported the information to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to</p>
<p>Arrest Them Both</p>
<p>And seized exquisite opium smoking paraphernalia from the two. They were jointly escorted to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the Special Second Court. After questioning by Judge Qiu Huan-ying, the two defendants were ordered to each pay a reliable shop guarantee of 2,000 yuan for attendance as summoned. All the details were reported in this newspaper. The hearing resumed yesterday morning. The two defendants, fearing punishment, avoided appearing in court. The court ordered the issuance of arrest warrants. After they were arrested in the afternoon, the hearing continued. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stood up and stated that the two defendants had been examined by a forensic doctor,</p>
<p>Confirmed to Have a Smoking Addiction</p>
<p>Therefore, they are being prosecuted for opium smoking and disrupting the family. Although the two defendants met in October of last year, the plaintiff had reported her husband's adultery to the police last year, and there are case files available. Therefore, the six-month statute of limitations has not been exceeded. The court is requested to administer the deserved punishment according to the law. The lawyers for the two defendants argued that the statute of limitations had expired and requested a judgment of non-acceptance. The plaintiff commissioned lawyers Yuan and Wu to</p>
<p>File a Civil Suit</p>
<p>Seeking compensation of 10,000 yuan for mental and material losses and proposed to file separate lawsuits for alimony, child support, and consolation money for the future divorce. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered that the case be scheduled for judgment on the morning of the 29th. Fearing that the two defendants might flee, in addition to the original bail, they were each ordered to pay an additional cash bail of 500 yuan. Before the cash bail is paid, they will be returned to custody.</p>

<p>According to Huawen News Agency, banditry has recently resurged in the western Shanghai area. At 1:30 a.m. yesterday morning, 17 bandits paid a visit to the Sihua Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 199F, Lane 99 (commonly known as Nancaojiazhai), Jisi Fei Road. The bandits first climbed in through the skylight on the roof, then opened the main gate to let the gang in, and then locked the main gate. At that time, the factory was working the night shift. The bandits each took out box cannons, forbidding any noise, and searched each of the female workers. They then broke into the accounting office and thoroughly searched it. A worker from the factory, named Jia, seized the opportunity to report by telephone to the "pseudo-bureau." The "bureau" immediately dispatched more than 20 police officers, who surrounded the factory on all sides. However, the bandits had already robbed more than 4,000 yuan in legal tender and escaped through the back door, causing the "pseudo-police" to toil in vain without gaining anything. Also, at 12:00 a.m. the night before last, 20 bandits patronized the Minsheng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 25. They also hired a truck, which was parked nearby. After the bandits broke into the factory, they first placed the factory staff under surveillance, then moved machinery and more than 30 bolts of silk onto the truck one after another, stepped on the gas, and sped away. As the bandits left, they fired a shot into the sky and said, "Be careful, we will ransack the entire area sooner or later." Therefore, the residents of the area are exceptionally alarmed.</p>

<p>Xu Yongkang, the director of the Yongxin Weaving Factory, had previously advertised the sale of the house at No. 125 Dayi Village, Lane 569, Albert Road. Huang Shihuan saw the advertisement and went to negotiate, agreed on a price, and paid a deposit. Unexpectedly, Huang suddenly changed his mind, wanting to return the deposit, and filed a lawsuit against Xu for fraud in the Second Special District Court. Xu was sentenced to a fine of 500 yuan and a suspended sentence of two years. It is now learned that Xu refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Xue Ziming to appeal to the Third High Court. After a review by Judge Wu, the evidence was deemed conclusive. Yesterday (21st), the original judgment was overturned, and Xu was acquitted. The incidental civil suit was dismissed.</p>

In addition to the four previously discovered patients, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital recently diagnosed another patient with true cholera, named Xu Shaoshi, 33 years old, a native of Shaoxing, and currently residing at No. 5, Wuding Lane, Wuding Road. According to Deng Qingshan, the director of medical affairs at the hospital, as of yesterday, a total of five patients with true cholera have been discovered in this city, and most of them came to Shanghai from Shaoxing to escape the famine. This is particularly noteworthy. Currently, due to the abnormal weather, in addition to true cholera, gastrointestinal inflammation is also extremely prevalent. The Epidemic Prevention Department of the Epidemic Hospital was opened early on the 21st, and citizens should also pay close attention to their diet and living arrangements.</p>

He established the Huiguang Real Estate Company in the Western Fool Road No. 843 Villa in Jiangxi Road 102 No. 4th Floor, Room 309, and served as the manager. Scale ambitious, business quite prosperous, and also possesses a No. 3913 car for transportation. Huang enjoys riding a horse for pleasure every morning to exercise his body.

At around 8:15 a.m. yesterday morning, Huang, wearing a white canvas suit and coffee-colored breeches, as usual, drove his No. 3913 car to the riding school on Daxi Road and rode out on horseback. As he was riding along the side of Daxi Road, three bandits suddenly appeared on the roadside. Two of them brandished pistols, ordered him to dismount, and forcibly put him in a No. 2802 car that was parked on the side of the road. The car sped west and escaped. As the bandits left, they fired a shot as a warning. Afterwards, an eyewitness reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Precinct police for investigation. According to the police yesterday morning, the license plate of the car used by the abductors was forged. However, the details are still under investigation. Huang's abduction is the same as the abduction of famous doctor Zhou Junchang and engineer Gu Pengcheng, who were kidnapped while riding in Western Shanghai on the 18th of last month.</p>

<p>Third, diligently study to broaden your talents. The world today is filled with many complex matters, but they can be summarized into four categories: military affairs, administrative affairs, financial affairs, and literary affairs. All those who come here should specialize in one of these four categories. Those who study military affairs should study war, offense, defense, terrain, and enemy situations. Those who study administrative affairs should study comforting the people, urging tax payment, hearing lawsuits, and agriculture. Those who study financial affairs should study land tax, customs duties, revenue sources, and expenditures. Those who study literary affairs should study memorials, regulations, official documents, and letters. The method of study is nothing more than learning and questioning. Learn from the past by reading more books; learn from the present by seeking more examples. Question those in charge to understand the difficulties; question bystanders to understand the effects. Diligent study without ceasing will naturally broaden your talents without you realizing it. Fourth, guard against arrogance and laziness to rectify customs. I have been in the military for a long time and do not understand numerology or divination, but I am quite able to foresee the signs of defeat. Generally, generals who are arrogant will be defeated, and those who are lazy will be defeated. This is not only true of generals, but also of all committee members. Those who are arrogant will inevitably ruin matters, and those who are lazy will inevitably be blamed. The origins of arrogance and laziness are subtle, but over time they become customs. If one person is self-righteous, then they will proclaim themselves a sage. If one person gets up late, then the whole country will turn day into night. I now agree with you all to do more practical things and say fewer big words. Do not avoid hard work, and do not boast of merit. If everyone keeps this in mind, then careers will emerge, customs will be rectified, and talents will flourish.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Finance and Foreign Exchange: Rumors Shift, Yesterday's Buyers Appear Strong Again <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The trend of the British and American exchange rates in the grey market was unstable, softening after a sharp rise. People are wary of changes in the situation and environment, and their attention is constantly shifting. The market initially appeared quite loose, with Chinese speculators selling aggressively and lacking buyers. Therefore, the American exchange rate once fell to 6.1875 yuan around 10:30 a.m. However, people's hearts were soon shaken, and Chinese banks began to settle, as did the Yokohama Specie Bank. Many short sellers covered their positions, so demand exceeded supply. By the time the market closed at noon, the British gold exchange rate had fallen to 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the American exchange rate had entered the 6 yuan range, at 5.96875 yuan. Compared to the previous day's closing, both the British and American exchange rates softened by 0.0625 and 0.03125 respectively. The loose trend of futures was no different from that of spot prices. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Shorts Aggressively Cover After the Drop</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate fell by 3.75 points for the near term and 0.0625 for the far term. New York silver prices remained flat, and London bullion prices were stable. The exchange rate for London was unchanged, up 0.0625 points for Shanghai, and unchanged for France. The American exchange rate was up 5.75 points for London, up 20 cents for Shanghai, and no telegraphs for France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with a spot selling price of 4 shillings for British currency and 6 yuan for the American exchange rate in the morning, which was flat and slightly tighter by 0.03125 points compared to the previous day's evening closing. Chinese speculators sold aggressively after opening, and the market loosened. They sold 6.0625 yuan and even 6.15625 yuan for American currency for this month to the foreign exchange market and speculators. HSBC's listed prices were announced with no changes. The silver half-balance tax was reduced by 2.00 percent. After that, Chinese speculators continued to dump, and prices became extremely loose. Spot American currency was sold cheaply by the foreign exchange market to speculators for 6.1875 yuan. The American currency for July was also traded at 6.0625 yuan. Although it stabilized slightly later, around 10:40 a.m., the current American currency rate was still 6.125 yuan, and the British gold rate was 4 shillings 0.46875 pence. The British exchange rate for the current American currency for June was also sold by foreign banks for 6.125 yuan. However, Chinese banks suddenly rose to settle, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also came to buy. The market image then changed. First, Chinese banks absorbed the British banks' American currency for June at 6.0625 yuan. The Yokohama Specie Bank entered the foreign exchange market, first making the spot rate drop to 4 shillings. At that time, rumors arose in the market, and people's hearts were slightly affected, and short covering increased. By the time the market closed at noon, the British gold exchange rate had returned to 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.96875 yuan. The British gold exchange rate for the next month was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.84375 yuan. Compared to the previous night's closing, spot British currency was 0.0625 points tighter, and American currency was 0.03125 points softer. The British currency for July also contracted by 0.0625 points, and the American currency tightened by 0.05125 points. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong American Currency Recovers</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Saturday) telegram: The exchange market opened loose this morning. The British exchange rate for spot and futures remained at the original level. The American exchange rate for spot increased by 1.875, to 22.5 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot decreased by 2 yuan, to 371 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate for spot also loosened by 1 yuan, to 94 yuan. At 9:30 a.m., it was reported to be loose. The American exchange rate for spot increased by 125, to 22.625 yuan. At 9:55 a.m., the American exchange rate for spot loosened again by 125, to 22.75 yuan. At 11:30 a.m., it was reported to be flat. The American exchange rate for spot recovered by 0.0625, to 22.6875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot recovered by 1 yuan, to 372 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 22nd (Saturday) telegram: The exchange market opened loose this morning. The British exchange rate for spot increased by 0.09375, to 3 shillings 5.625 pence. The American exchange rate for spot increased by 25, to 5.375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 1 yuan, to 114 yuan and 5 jiao. The "Joint Currency" in the grey market was expensive by 1 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, to 97 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Chinese and Foreign Bank Instruments <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Entrusting Zhejiang Industrial to Act as Agent for the Exchange of Huayi Bank. The clearing of instruments between Chinese merchant banks and foreign merchant banks in this city has always been handled by Chinese merchant banks, which concentrated at the instrument clearing house run by the United Preparatory Committee of the banking industry, starting the exchange at 3:30 p.m. The member banks of the Foreign Merchant Bank Association cleared their instruments by having each bank send personnel to the HSBC Bank every day to exchange tickets, with the exchange time being 12:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday and 11:30 a.m. on Saturday. Chinese merchant banks, in order to facilitate the payment of foreign merchant bank instruments, mostly opened current accounts with foreign merchant banks. However, when foreign merchant banks received instruments from Chinese merchant banks, they ordered that they be exchanged separately for foreign merchant bank checks or bank preparatory funds allocation slips, and settled accounts with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank. Because the clearing mechanisms of Chinese and foreign banks are not unified, the circulation of instruments is hindered. For example, if a Chinese merchant bank receives an instrument payable by a foreign merchant bank, it must be received before noon in order to be deposited. After noon, it must be entered into the account for the next day. Mr. Yongyu of the banking community, in view of this, once published an article in the Banking Journal entitled "Preliminary Proposal for Centralized Clearing of Instruments of Chinese and Foreign Merchant Banks," advocating that foreign merchant banks should participate in Chinese merchant bank instrument clearing houses. Recently, the Huayi Bank, in order to facilitate the circulation of instruments and eliminate the cumbersome and time-consuming roundabout procedures of previous instrument clearing, decided to join the Chinese merchant bank instrument clearing house by means of entrusting an agent for exchange. It entrusted the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to act as an agent for exchanging instruments. This has been approved by the executive committee meeting of the United Preparatory Committee of the banking industry, and it is scheduled to begin joining the agency exchange tomorrow (24th), opening the precedent for foreign merchant banks to join the Chinese merchant bank instrument exchange, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Gold Market Potential Turns Firm <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for pure gold was dull. After an initial drop, it recovered slightly, and the situation was mediocre. Operators were entering and exiting frequently, but transactions were active with small quantities. Price fluctuations also narrowed. The morning price was 5,400 yuan, 85 yuan lower than the previous close. At that time, due to frequent reports of fluctuating exchange rates, the price was suppressed around the 5,450 yuan level, unable to rise. Later, due to rumors of favorable news, the exchange rate tightened, triggering considerable buying interest from banks and other institutions. There was some downward pressure, reportedly due to heavy selling by a certain gold firm. The highest price reached only 5,520 yuan, and the market closed at 5,510 yuan, up 25 yuan from the previous evening's settlement. There was no trading on Saturday afternoon, but the market sentiment outside the exchange remained firm. The after-hours price was 30 yuan higher than the afternoon close, but there was little selling pressure. The trading volume for the half-day was about 2,800 taels. Jewelry shops increased the price of gold ornaments by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Rises 25 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially opened 85 yuan lower due to the weak exchange rate, with gold firms selling. Gold firms sold 30 taels to banks at 5,400 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm suddenly developed buying interest, and banks also joined in, immediately pushing the price back up to 5,480 yuan, with banks trading 10 taels among themselves. Soon after, a money exchange suddenly sold, and securities firms followed suit, pushing the price down again by 60 yuan, with securities firms selling 20 taels to banks at 5,420 yuan. Later, as banks' appetite remained strong, the price rose again, and soon the exchange rate was reported to have weakened, and buying interest gradually increased. Although a certain gold firm was selling in between, the price was eventually pushed up by 100 yuan, with banks buying 20 taels from money exchanges at 5,520 yuan. After this, the buying interest slowed down, and banks took profits, pushing the price down to 5,450 yuan again. At noon, buying interest resurfaced, as the exchange rate was tighter than the previous day, and there were rumors that the "New Central" Bank would issue banknotes. As a result, operators rushed to buy, and gold firms were eager to cover their short positions, driving the price up to 5,520 yuan again. Subsequently, banks traded 10 taels among themselves, setting the noon closing price at 5,510 yuan, a rise of 25 yuan compared to the previous day. The after-hours market situation was even better, reaching as high as 5,540 yuan, with a fluctuation of 120 yuan in the half-day. The current selling price of spot gold by gold firms is several dozen yuan higher than the marked price, and the buy-in price is 30 yuan lower. The current price for standard gold is over 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there is little trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Up 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry by jewelry shops was initially 560 yuan per tael at Da Tong Hang, but was later raised by 10 yuan at noon. There were no further changes after that. Da Tong Hang now lists the price at 570 yuan. The price at Xin Tong Hang is the same, with the buy-in price around 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Call Loan Rate Reduced by One Cent <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills was consistently 72 yuan per thousand yuan for buy-in and 78 yuan for sell-out throughout the day, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Trade Association was lowered by one cent, to 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Foreign Currencies Fluctuate Frequently <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw pure gold fluctuating upwards, with British and American gold pounds following suit. There was some demand for British gold notes, and the market price rose slightly. The price of American gold notes initially fell to 16.08 yuan, but rumors that a certain bank would dump a large amount of foreign exchange on the black market caused the market price to rise sharply, once reaching as high as 16.70 yuan. In the afternoon, it fluctuated to 16.50 yuan, but it was still better than the previous day by 10 cents. The price of Hong Kong notes rose in the morning but returned to flat in the afternoon. The price of Canadian and Philippine notes both rose by 20 cents. The demand for Japanese gold notes increased slightly, and the evening price was 1.09 yuan. The price of Korean notes rose slightly to 95 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Grains and Rice Prices Are Too High, Still Fluctuating by One Yuan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices, after turning flat previously, had some fluctuations yesterday, but the fluctuation in the entire city was only around one yuan, unlike the drastic changes in the past. This is because prices have already been raised sufficiently, and customers generally find it difficult to cope with the retail prices. Although the supply of foreign rice is said to be difficult to transport from coastal defense areas, Siam can still trade unhindered, and road shipments are continuously arriving. Warehouses in Shanghai also have rich reserves. Under these circumstances, how can the market continue to rise? Therefore, at the opening of the market in the morning, both buyers and sellers were watching and did not dare to buy rashly. There were few transactions at that time, and the situation was very sluggish. The prices of various foreign rice varieties once fell by one yuan. No. 1 Saigon old rice was sold for only 65 yuan, and Small Pattern rice was sold for 61 yuan. However, after this decline, it immediately stimulated strong buying interest from shops and domestic clients. Speculators, who had intended to lure the market before trapping it, saw the market turning slightly and immediately took action, pushing up the prices and shouting orders. The prices of various varieties immediately returned to their original levels. After this, although sellers were still trying to push the price higher, sales quickly weakened, and the market turned into a fluctuating state. By the afternoon, those who had made profits competed to sell, and the market began to fall by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. Small Pattern rice closed in the evening at only 61 yuan, 61.30 yuan at the bank warehouses, and the price of original packages retrieved was 66.50 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice shipped in 18-pack was initially received at 70 yuan, but fell to 68 yuan in the afternoon, and the closing price rose by 50 cents again. The 26-pack shipment also opened at 68 yuan, but there were no further settlements. No. 2 Saigon rice shipped at the beginning of the month opened at 68 yuan. In total, 250 tons of retrieved goods arrived, and 7,500 packages of spot goods were offered.</p>
<p>There were over 1,000 packages of Japanese glutinous rice and japonica rice arriving successively. It is rumored that the after-hours trading of japonica rice is still flat, similar to before, while the sales of glutinous rice on the market have become less active than before. Therefore, although cargo owners continue to try to push prices higher, they have not succeeded, and the result is still flat. The prices of all varieties remain unchanged. Jin Shen Special Yuan is still listed at 60.05 yuan to 60.10 yuan, Chang Dan goods are around 59 yuan, and Jiangbei Bai Yuan is 57 or 58 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e77">This Factory Suffers from Lack of Wheat; Japanese Factories Sell Futures <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: The market remained strong yesterday. Daily supply for actual sales is estimated at around 6,000 packages. Sales to out-of-town clients have long been unrestricted, so the price of retrieved flour from out-of-town clients reached as high as 16.50 yuan. The old cart warehouse receipt must also be 14.50 yuan, with some differences in between. As for the Chinese factories, because the wheat harvest has been under control, it is difficult to find a way to dredge the supply. It is feared that the raw materials will not be able to keep up in the future, and it will be difficult to continue retail sales on this street. As for the Japanese factories, they have a slightly better grasp of purchasing new wheat, so they have even pre-sold futures.</p>
<p>Wheat: The transportation problem has not yet returned to normal. Although a small number of wheat shipments have arrived at nearby Kunshan and Taicang, the price has gradually increased. A formal market is probably still pending.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Securities: Domestic Bonds Remain Stable as Before <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The after-hours securities market was stable and remained stable as before, without any excitement. Trading continued to decrease. The general public is still speculating about Stimson's appearance and Song Ziwen's flight to the United States. In short, in this turbulent time, the bond market can still be firm, which shows the confidence of the bondholders. The principal and interest of the ninth issue will soon be due, and it is expected that it will still be paid as before. Therefore, there is no other reason to look forward to a rise or fall in the future. Yesterday, Datong Yitai and general retail investors sold one after another, while Dafeng, Tianfeng, Houda and Wanchun bought one after another. Therefore, the result was that Class A and B continued to be good by one cent, while the rest were flat without any fluctuations. The total trading volume was only around 300,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded, at a price of 6.25 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Friday): Today's market for British Far East companies' stocks saw banking stocks weakening. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. shares fell half a pound to 6 pounds 15 shillings. HSBC's UK-registered shares fell 2 pounds to 66 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell 1 pound to 72 pounds. Chartered Bank shares fell 7 shillings and 6 pence to 12 pounds. The rest saw minor movements.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Friday): Today's market for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable. The prices of all bonds remained unchanged, hovering around the 1,000 yuan mark.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton Markets Barely Survive; Double Horse Hovering Around 1,000 Yuan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was slightly stable, with a stable trend. This is because the Japanese warships gathered in the South China Sea, but the sea route from Hong Kong to Haiphong has resumed, and various shipping companies are operating as usual, transporting goods. This has slightly improved people's mood, so that the exhausted yarn market can be temporarily supported. However, the June delivery may cause problems.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market in the morning, the atmosphere in the market was mediocre due to the weakness of the exchange rate and the shortness of the gold price. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 960 yuan, falling to 955 yuan. Later, because the bulls slightly stirred and bought in, and there was a rumor of favorable news, the price rose to 988 yuan. However, after the price rose, there were few buyers again, and it fell back to 970 yuan. After the close, it was heard that someone was buying, and it rose by more than 10 yuan. The half-day turnover was 1,575 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 11 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Same trade: 160 Hong Kong: 330</p>
<p>Ningbo: 55 Inland: 50</p>
<p>Total: 1,575</p>
<h3 id="e80">Raw Cotton Market Greatly Devalued; After-Hours Trading Unwilling to Announce, Fearing It Will Hinder the Market <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton market is completely cut off. Because the yarn market is weak, the factories have sufficient cotton in stock to meet the needs of the new cotton season, so there are no purchases all day long. As for the same trade, most of the cotton ordered from overseas has arrived in full, and there is little strength to develop at present. A little trading on the market is all after-hours trading, because the prices are too low in formal trading, they are unwilling to announce.</p>
<p>Another report is that the price of foreign cotton on the market was weak yesterday. Because there was a lack of major buyers on the market, and the Southern trade group sold short, the closing price was higher in the near term by one pound, and lower in the long term by three or four pounds. The Indian cotton market fell by two rupees yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently, with no improvement on all sides, and it is quite stagnant. Although the factories all have no inventory for February, they have no intention of purchasing. According to the current situation, the future is difficult to see as bright.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Retrospective on the Yarn Industry Turmoil <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The disastrous defeat of the yarn industry this time can be described as unprecedented. There is hardly a day without companies going bankrupt and being liquidated. There are already dozens of companies that have been made public. There are even more who have absconded without settling their debts, and those who are in a fence-sitting position between seeming to be bankrupt and not bankrupt. The sharp decline in market prices, which leaves practitioners no room to breathe, is a major reason. However, the one who tied the bell must untie it. The blind raising of prices in the past, not following the correct path, sowing melons and reaping melons, the consequences are not a little bit wrong. However, the reasons for the past disastrous defeat may be explored to leave a lesson for the future.</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Strict Membership Review: Membership in the industry association must be subject to strict review. Those who are not engaged in the cotton yarn industry should not be eligible for membership. Regulations such as capital requirements must be investigated. However, the implementers always prioritize personal relationships and focus on membership fees. They refuse no one, which has created a mixture of good and bad members. The number of members has increased sharply, and the order is poor. Among them, there are many who have bad intentions and make desperate bets. Therefore, they stir up trouble and act recklessly. When the backlash comes, how can they not be completely defeated?</p>
<p>(2) Unfair Handling of Bad Debts: If industry events can be handled fairly, the problem will not spread like wildfire. However, some people protect their relatives. For example, a certain firm is not self-sufficient, which leads to poor turnover. When they come out to talk about bad debts, it is one or two cents, or two or three cents that settles the matter (in fact, the bankrupts escape and hoard private savings, they are not really bankrupt). Afterwards, the firm can still join the association and continue to operate as usual, like a "bath". If you don't talk about credibility like this, it is not surprising that cunning people think about taking advantage, and going bankrupt is not considered strange.</p>
<p>(3) Manipulating Market Control Methods: What is even more despised by the industry is that they often use their own business situation, such as the market price standard for the hard closing price in May, and the previous announcements forbidding futures trading by faking orders, in order to control market prices and enrich their own pockets. Moreover, during the time of raising prices, they blindly follow suit without considering the pros and cons. For example, a certain yarn 20-count Yueqin brand (in industry terminology, it is called a football goods, meaning the object of chasing the deer) was raised to a highest price of more than 1,800 yuan. At the same time, the price of the same goods and those with higher bodies than the Yueqin brand was instead pressed down to 5 or 600 yuan. The lack of rational blind following can be seen from this. As for today's counter-movement, it is also not following the correct path, and there are also reasons for this (the recent low price of Yueqin brand is only around 800 yuan, and it is also a rare event that the difference from the high price is thousands of yuan). The association's transactions were originally based on domestically produced cotton yarn. Those who occasionally run a certain kind of yarn mostly do it secretly and dare not openly trade. After the association's address was expanded, it used the entire second floor exclusively for this kind of buying and selling, without collecting fixed foreign currency. Therefore, everyone followed suit. Since there are many operators, the storm is also great. Those who have bad intentions are like buying lottery tickets, winning the jackpot, and fleeing if they don't win. Therefore, with the coming of counter-movements, there are many who abscond, and those who are involved in turn are mostly harmed by it. Without any maintenance, the number of bankrupts is so great. In addition, the fact that intermediaries never take responsibility and set up their own firms to transfer accounts and scrape oil is also closely related to the entire yarn industry. People outside the industry do not know and mistakenly enter the shell, and there are many who lose their families and businesses. (Xiang)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Silk and Tea: Lake Silk Shipped to Europe, Transshipped to New York <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Before the fall of Paris, European and American companies rushed to load cargo of Shanghai Lake Silk shipped to Europe. However, it is recently learned that the raw silk exported from Shanghai in early June failed to reach its destination and was picked up separately in Hong Kong and a certain place in Yidong and transshipped to New York. The sale of European silk has now fallen into despair, and the resumption of Euro-Asian transportation is indefinite. The Shanghai silk market only has the United States as its main customer.</p>
<p>It is rumored that a special tax of 12% will be levied on domestic silk transported to Shanghai starting in July. It is calculated that each dan of white factory silk will have to pay 600 yuan, and earth silk will have to pay 300 yuan. However, it is heard that the name of the special tax is "excessive profit". Therefore, the inside story of the problem of raw silk coming to Shanghai is not simple. Even after paying the excessive profit "tax", it is still unknown whether raw silk can come to Shanghai. It is said that the shipment of raw silk must also have items such as a move-in certificate and a move-in fee. Therefore, both the source and outlet of the silk industry have become problems.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Oilseed Cake: Oil Market First Tight, Then Weak <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market, continuing the upward trend of the previous day, was still quite active with general quick-profit buying. Various quotations were pushed up by another yuan compared to the previous day, but actual sales still did not improve. A good situation was fatally hit. By the afternoon, due to lack of support, the situation suddenly changed, falling by one yuan and no one asking about it. The overall situation entered into a slump again. In the morning, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were traded at 69.50 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai peanut oil were traded at 68.50 yuan, 1,000 tins of Jiangbei local oil were traded at 100 yuan, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 69 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil were traded at 70 yuan, 100 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded at 71 yuan, 70 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were traded at 90 yuan to 98.50 yuan, 50 barrels of Pei Dong Factory soybean oil were traded at 75.50 yuan, 40 barrels of Taishan Factory soybean oil were traded at 75.67 yuan, and 200 dan of Da You Factory soybean oil were traded at 77.50 yuan to 78 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was affected by the exchange rate, which was first weak and then tight. Therefore, the public association's market also fluctuated accordingly. The spot price of 24 thick white sugar from foreign warehouses was 69 yuan to 68.90 yuan in the morning, and rose back by 30 cents to 69.10 yuan in the afternoon. The price of transshipment goods with warehouse receipts issued immediately was 54.80 yuan in the morning, and 55.40 yuan for delivery on July 2. The price of transshipment goods with warehouse receipts issued immediately rose to 55.20 yuan in the afternoon. Taikoo Vehicle White B Mark's new goods from the West warehouse were 81 yuan, the East warehouse was 80 yuan, and the Dutch red was 59.50 yuan. The price of Xuebai from this factory was 70 yuan. The trend of domestic sugar was stable, and transactions increased. Yesterday, 70 bags of Xinghua Sifting Green sugar were opened at 65 yuan, 143 bags of Xinghua Green sugar were opened at 64 yuan, and the final price was 62.50 yuan. 155 bags of Baibao Gao Diao Qing sugar were opened at 64 yuan, and dozens of bags of Haikou Yang sugar were opened at 63.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Dried and Preserved Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Falls 3 Yuan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The sales of thin vermicelli have been weak recently, and the price has fallen again. Yesterday, Longkou vermicelli was sold at 115 yuan, a drop of 3 yuan compared to before. Qingdao vermicelli was 90 yuan, and Yingshan Tang vermicelli was 45 or 46 yuan. However, the market supply of Jiangbei vermicelli is scarce, and there is no market price at present.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Piece Goods: East Cloth Activity Rebounds <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday the cloth market turned firmer. Although there was not much trading in the products of this factory, the industry inside and out actively made purchases due to the sharp drop in price of East piece goods. Fine cloth rebounded by more than 2 yuan per piece, and Serge rose by more than 4 cents per yard. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 28.78 yuan, and it was 29.60 yuan at noon. Later, the industry competed to cover short positions, and the bulls added more, and the market atmosphere was even stronger. The price of Longtou rose to 30.05 yuan, and the price of Four Gentlemen Serge rose to 8.35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Khaki Drill Fabric, Because of Chinese Factories <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for khaki drill fabric saw standard price hold firm because the production of Chinese factories was limited and there was a lack of imported goods in stock. Meanwhile, the selection and designation for changing clothes continued, resulting in demand exceeding supply and active sales. Among the woven yarn goods, it has very much stood out above the crowd. Yesterday, British-made khaki drill was sold wholesale for 3.5 yuan per yard, East goods Elephant Deer brand was 2.6 yuan, Yih Ho Shen weave Toucan brand was 1.885 yuan, and the domestic Hongzhang brand was 1.6 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Medicine: Smoked Plum Market Turns Dull <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The source of smoked plums is not lacking, so the market inventory is full. The previous market had relatively smooth sales, and the highest price was over 41 or 42 yuan. As the customer appetite has been satisfied recently, the trend has turned soft. It is heard that there are more than 40 pieces of customer goods in the market, asking for 35 or 36 yuan, but there are few buyers. The price must fall by 5 or 6 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Hardware: Antimony Soars <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The market for antimony (i.e., dull antimony) has recently seen scarce commodity due to blocked sources and limited inventory in the Shanghai market. The trading is still sluggish, but the market sentiment is still firm and high. Therefore, the standard market price has increased sharply by 300 or 400 yuan per ton compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Rise in Foreign Lead Prices <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Canadian foreign lead transactions: Yesterday's market saw transactions of thirty to forty dan (a unit of weight). It's noted that recently, due to the difficulty in importing Canadian lead and transportation obstructions, it's rumored that the current market's buying and selling relies solely on a small stock within this port. Therefore, those in the industry are optimistic, and the market price is currently selling at one hundred thirty yuan per dan.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The British National Character <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Churchill said, "The Battle of France is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin. I firmly believe that the men and women of the British Empire can cope with this severe test. The opportunity for everyone to demonstrate our nation's fighting power has arrived. If we fight and win, all conquered nations will be restored. If we fight and lose, the whole world will fall into a dark age again. We must cheer up, do our duty. If the British Empire continues for a thousand years, people will say 'This was the greatest period.'"</p>
<p>This is Churchill's battle cry to the British people. The outcome of this battle, militarily, will determine whether the British navy or the German air force and army are stronger; politically, it will determine whether democracy or dictatorship will lead Europe in the future. The Napoleonic Wars in history are about to be re-enacted, and whether there will be another Battle of Waterloo is temporarily unknown.</p>
<p>In 1806, Napoleon's territory included a large part of France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Poland. After his navy was defeated in the Battle of Trafalgar, his army was still able to maintain itself on the European continent for ten years. In the end, the victory or defeat was still determined by the British naval power. At that time, Napoleon did not need to seek military supplies from overseas. The opposite is true of Hitler, but Napoleon did not have Hitler's air force. Naturally, he could not make use of his heroism in the British Isles. The current situation is different.</p>
<p>The British have a well-known poem that says:</p>
<p>All that we have been foretells our future;</p>
<p>The voice of Shakespeare, the hand of Nelson,</p>
<p>The faith of Milton, the weighty trust of Welles-Wells</p>
<p>This land of ours, endowed with freedom,</p>
<p>Let the world see: Though the whole world opposes,</p>
<p>What can they do to England?</p>
<p>This is the British belief. Whether this belief can still be shaken by the tide of the times is also temporarily unknown.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the British national character naturally has a major impact on the future of the war. This journal will now translate the following records from the New York Times:</p>
<p>On the evening of the day of the Allied forces' defeat and retreat, a correspondent from the New York Times, while buying a newspaper from an old man on "Fleet Street" in London, asked him, "What's the news tonight?" The old news vendor replied, "I don't know. I never read the newspaper, because I know we will win in the end."</p>
<p>This fully demonstrates the British national character. They are always optimistic when encountering difficulties. Hitting a British person's head is like hammering a nail into the ground. The harder you hit, the more stable they become.</p>
<p>The national character of a country is best demonstrated during wartime. There is nothing unusual about that newspaper-selling old man.</p>
<p>In the first few battles of each decisive fight, the British seem like a tired and overly self-reliant old boxer, but after two or three stumbling swings, this boxer gradually shows his strength to win the championship.</p>
<p>The last war has proved that the British can withstand extraordinary blows from the enemy and still act as if nothing has happened. They have shown the world that even when the German army is approaching the English Channel and even when the British are starving, they can still rise up and fight back. The British have unlimited endurance and can bravely and happily fight in poorly equipped trenches. Now they still have the physical courage of that time.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Norwegian campaign, Churchill said to the British people that Hitler's invasion of Scandinavia was the biggest military mistake since Napoleon's expedition to Spain. Three weeks later, the Germans drove the Allied forces out of the Arctic Circle, but the British were not discouraged at that time and have not been discouraged now.</p>
<p>The British way of rejecting troubles creates both strength and obvious weaknesses at the same time. The so-called strength is that because they refuse to worry, the British are stronger than any other nation in the world in their ability to endure hardship and their fearlessness of defeat, but at the same time, it is also a weakness, because sometimes they confuse contentment with self-confidence and misjudge their dangerous position for the sake of contentment.</p>
<p>This is only the case when newspapers and the public are patient with the government. When the country is in a critical situation, their transformation is also very rapid. This situation can be illustrated by what happened in early May. Since Chamberlain agreed to fully report the Norwegian campaign publicly, there has been no fierce rhetoric in the newspapers for several days. At this time, the British army withdrew from Northern Europe, and wounded soldiers began to be seen on the streets of London. These people brought the war closer to the British people, and when Chamberlain's speech failed to meet the expectations of the newspapers, they finally launched a major attack on him.</p>
<p>Judging from this experience, in addition to their calm appearance and quiet words, the British also contain the quality of clear anger. They have their own art of restraining themselves. This cultivation has been going on for a long time, so it is not easy to reveal the quality of anger; once it erupts, the power is somewhat terrifying.</p>
<p>At present, no matter where you go in the UK, it is difficult to hear the argument that the UK will be defeated. The British were surprised to see American newspapers discussing what would happen if Germany won. Some people even found it strange. They repeatedly said, "The British lose every battle, but they will win the last battle." They regard this as a guide to success and express joy.</p>
<p>The ability to cooperate is the first characteristic of the British. In private conversations and most casual interactions with people, the first impulse of the British is to cooperate. When you talk to him, he nods repeatedly out of his nature to show agreement. Sometimes, even if he completely opposes your meaning, he still expresses it this way.</p>
<p>The situation is similar in politics. For example, in any country in the world, which government gives the leader of the opposition a higher salary than ordinary members of parliament, because he is doing his best to subvert the government?</p>
<p>Coexisting with the nature of cooperation is the British's inherent honesty and the resulting trust in their companions. In wartime, self-reliance, cooperation, and trust are often the source of great strength. But in the past seven years, if these three aspects could have been handled more expediently, the war might have been avoided long ago, or the Allied forces would have been in a very advantageous position.</p>
<p>For example, the defeat of the Allied forces in Norway and on the Western Front, except for the Americans, may have greatly shaken their self-reliance and greatly weakened their combat power. Of course, the British still criticize the political situation in restaurants and tea houses; but because of some inertia in their reason, such as what they often say, "There's no need to make a fuss," and their very strong belief in final victory, and their nature of cooperating with any government in power, the British do not often take drastic measures in any event.</p>
<p>One fact can prove this point. Since the Allied forces withdrew from Norway, all the newspapers have advocated that the Allied forces must immediately increase the production of aircraft so that they can compete with the German army in the sky. This call was unanimously supported by the whole country, but all the major aircraft manufacturers, except for one, still stopped work and took holidays as usual during Whitsun.</p>
<p>To explain this kind of thing, one can only answer with British history. Because for nearly nine hundred years, invaders have never set foot on British territory. And because since the Battle of Trafalgar, for more than a hundred years, Britain has been safely behind the iron walls of the North Sea, and can really look down on the world. This kind of self-reliance has grown deeper and deeper and is firmly imprinted in their minds. In terms of instinct, the British cannot imagine the possibility of losing a battle.</p>
<p>In a time of national crisis, the actions led by national instinct may be better than those produced by reason. The most obvious characteristics of the British instinct or national character today--the nature of fair treatment, cooperation, trust, and self-satisfaction--were developed in an era when Britain had no external troubles, when the British navy dominated the world, and when global transportation was still developing slowly. But today, the British national character must be active in a new environment. What he is dealing with is a new and reckless enemy with new and rapid weapons, capable of challenging the powerful British navy. In this new environment, the British character cannot be used easily.</p>
<p>Here is another good example. At the beginning of the Norwegian campaign, a British reconnaissance plane spotted an airfield where the German army was flying soldiers to Norway. The airfield was located in Aalborg, Denmark. When this British airman was reconnoitering over the airfield, he found that the airfield was full of German transport planes. He immediately reported this to the peak. Because this airfield was located in the former neutral country of Denmark, the ministers discussed it for three days before finally allowing the British planes to bomb it, but several German planes had already flown to Norway with soldiers.</p>
<p>The British have a stiff temperament and do not need to be treated too well. There is also a characteristic that is deeply imprinted in their minds during the leisure years, which is an unparalleled sense of responsibility. The British generally see Britain as the protector of small and weak nations. Because of their love of freedom and justice, the British often regard themselves as defenders of justice. He is unwilling to meddle in other people's affairs unless he thinks it is necessary. He is also an individualist and does not want the state to interfere in his private life; but in times of crisis, all the state has to do is call on him loudly, and he will immediately agree to do it, and will not seek to understand why.</p>
<p>This kind of patriotism seems to be hidden in his bones. He has a deep historical concept and a blind belief in Britain's supreme destiny. He may not be interested in the phrase "The white race has a great responsibility", but like a small shareholder with one yuan of capital in a large company with 10,000 yuan of capital, he is proud of having this relationship and is eager to sacrifice himself for the country once the country is in trouble.</p>
<p>As a young American diplomat said, "The British need someone to run over and shout at them from a high place. This shout must have the power to inspire the past, present, and future. As long as there is a great leader, then manpower, courage, and material resources are ready, and victory can be guaranteed." The picture on the right shows Gibraltar, the throat of the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Hitler's Autopsy <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Here is a man who excels in conquest, whose ambition surpasses Alexander the Great, Caesar, and Napoleon, who not only desires to conquer others but also seeks to transform the world through revolutionary means. This man is leading his great army, fiercely attacking the final obstacles. This man, who rose from the slums of Vienna, is about to become the master of hundreds of millions of people, the most powerful warlord of our time, Hitler. Whether this man will be regarded as a hero or a villain in history will depend on the success or failure of his military achievements.</p>
<p>Regardless of his success or failure, judging by his methods, Hitler's dreams are unprecedented in scale and thoroughness of totalitarianism. The complete realization of this kind of dream has exceeded the capabilities of a mere visionary and has become a concrete political program, backed by a military force that is unrivaled in the world. This man has a strong will, a keen mind, and a robust perseverance, bearing burdens that ordinary people cannot bear. His physical and mental energy is astonishing. But what kind of person is Hitler really?</p>
<p>It is never easy to explore anyone's soul and measure the complex motivations behind their actions, let alone someone as complex as Hitler. Hitler possesses a dual personality. One is the private Hitler, still bearing traces of his self-sufficient life in his hometown of Braunau am Inn in Austria. The other is the public Hitler, a dictator and warlord, whose position, unlike Mussolini's affectations, has become integrated into his life.</p>
<p>The private Hitler is short in stature and unremarkable in appearance, as ordinary as the people in the border region between Germany and the Czech Republic. His only distinguishing features are his short mustache and his small, blue-brown eyes, full of poetic introspection. In public, he is often shy and awkward, appearing ungraceful, with the air of "this insignificant little man."</p>
<p>For the sake of health, faith, and self-discipline, he is a vegetarian who abstains from alcohol and tobacco. He possesses the rustic character of the Alps but lacks the bearing of a German, clearly not from the ruling class.</p>
<p>The public Hitler, on the other hand, is a head of state, a mass orator, a dictator, and a warlord, completely different from the private Hitler. This transformation is often sudden and astonishing. This public Hitler is exuberant, highly self-confident, domineering, omniscient, and omnipotent, acting as if he is the only one of any importance. He does not talk, only gives speeches; he does not discuss, only issues orders; he does not walk, only rushes. His appearance changes dramatically, and he seems to grow taller. Therefore, those who have only seen Hitler in public are often surprised by his "short stature" when they meet him face to face. The public Hitler's face transforms into a hideous mask. His eyes stare intently, and his voice often rises from a calm, somber tone to a shrill pitch.</p>
<p>This Hitler is no longer a human being but a physical embodiment of an idea. Those who hate him are terrified, and those who love him are entranced. His personal bodyguards and paratrooper suicide squads are merely two groups of people captivated by his charisma. Hitler's extraordinary qualities are what give his speeches their enchanting power, and the general audience sometimes worships him as a god.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a third, secret Hitler, known only to his confidants. This Hitler, though his nerves are tormented by the contradictions between his dual personalities and the heavy burdens he bears, can quickly regain control and move forward as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Whether Hitler has ever loved any man or woman besides his mother is unknown. Whether he is loyal to anything other than his self-proclaimed mission is also unknown. In his book "Mein Kampf," apart from expressing love for his mother and his hometown in Austria, he fills the pages with words of criticism and rebellion, considering everything else unworthy of attention. The first person he rebelled against was his overly strict father, for whom he only expressed "respect" while opposing his father's attempt to force him into a narrow official career. He then hated the school regulations that prevented him from receiving a formal education. Hitler's father hated the fierce ethnic struggles between Pan-Germans and Czechs in the border region where he was born. Hitler's entire childhood was influenced by this struggle. His first political idea, nationalism within the National Socialist movement, was rooted in this. Later, the Vienna Academy of Arts' refusal to recognize Hitler's artistic talent also aroused his resentment.</p>
<p>Secondly, Hitler also despised the social, economic, and political systems that forced him to work as a construction worker and postcard painter, eking out a living in the slums of Vienna and Munich. He also hated the Marxists who forced him to join a labor union, which often left him unemployed. In these times of poverty and hardship, he hated everything about the status quo, such as the Habsburg monarchy of Austria, the parliamentary system, Marxism, and the Jews. This resentment grew over time, fostering a spirit of rebellion.</p>
<p>Four years after the end of the Great War, Hitler witnessed the collapse of Germany and was himself penniless. Personal humiliation and national grievances combined to fan the embers into a raging fire. At that time, Hitler was investigating political activities for the German military authorities. He happened to meet patriots and became interested, rising to give speeches to them and discovering that he was gifted in speaking and could sway people's hearts. His career as a political leader and the greatest revolutionary of all time began there.</p>
<p>What made Hitler stand out was certainly not just his eloquence. There were many others who sought to revive Germany, but only Hitler succeeded. The reason for this is that despising everything was a powerful driving force, but the inherited cunning, intuition, and sensitivity of generations of farmers, grasping the essentials and not being swayed by the environment, was also the secret to his success.</p>
<p>In short, Hitler's early life of hardship and his experience of social and national collapse fostered a sense of disgust, which was then developed into a revolutionary fervor. Having achieved something, he developed an unshakable belief in his own destiny and the mission he was charged to reform the world.</p>
<p>Hitler lived a simple life with a restrained diet. As the head of a major world power, he was still unable to find contentment, because Hitlerism had risen above Hitler himself. He was now bound by the movement he had created, and this movement was like a bicycle: it either moved forward or fell over. (Translated from The New York Times)</p>

<h3 id="e102">A Few Words on the Summer Homework Competition <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>The purpose of this newspaper's summer homework competition is to encourage children's self-study spirit through competition and to arouse children's interest in self-study through rewards. Although the competition items are unable to include all primary school subjects, and are insufficient to substitute all the school's summer homework, it can at least be regarded as a new force to promote children's summer homework. It is hoped that all teachers will accept this humble intention of this newspaper, list this newspaper's homework topics into this year's summer homework, and earnestly guide the children to practice. All works should strive to preserve the true face of the children, because the purpose of participating in the competition is not to win awards, but to use the new factors that encourage children's homework to develop self-study habits. This is what I want to say to the teachers. Family and school must cooperate closely. During the summer vacation, children live in the family, and the responsibility of supervising summer homework undoubtedly falls on the parents. Arrange all the homework evenly throughout the entire vacation, and teach your children to go step by step. Pay attention to whether your children lack perseverance, and pay attention to whether your children are perfunctory and sloppy. Rather than using strict supervision, it is better to use positive encouragement. The result of strict supervision is often reluctance and perfunctoriness. Positive encouragement can make children excited and work hard. This is what I want to say to the parents.</p>
<p>Children, the homework that your teachers give you during the summer vacation is just as important as regular classes. You should respect the teachers' orders, use the cool mornings and evenings to schedule a self-study timetable, and manage yourself regardless of whether your parents supervise you. You must always earnestly study on your own, think thoroughly about the meaning, write neatly and cleanly, and draw correctly and beautifully. After completing each question, you must carefully review it, correct mistakes, and do your best to produce results that you think are satisfactory. If you want to win an award, please ask your older siblings to be hired guns. If you want to deceive others, you will first become a dishonest child. Isn't the word "dishonest" the most shameful term? Therefore, you must work hard on your own. This is what I want to say to the children.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Spartan Children's Training <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Rong</p>
<p>The most famous city in ancient Greece was Sparta. In a certain period, Sparta was a very strong country, because there were brave and strong people in the country. Those brave and strong people were rigorously trained in their childhood.</p>
<p>The training that Spartan children received was somewhat excessive. It seems cruel now. When a child was born, he had to undergo a strict examination. If he was healthy, he was handed over to his parents to be raised. If he was sick or weak, he was thrown into the deep mountains to be starved to death or eaten alive by wild animals.</p>
<p>Therefore, only a group of healthy children grew into adults. However, when they reached the age of seven, the father had to leave the family and go to an educational institution to receive strict physical training. After this training, no one knew how to be lazy. They slept on reeds at night, which served as a soft bed, and wore only one robe throughout the year, which also served as a blanket at night.</p>
<p>Spartan children were completely trained to have the spirit of enduring pain and hardship, and never groaned in pain, because in their eyes, fear of pain was considered the most shameful thing. Sometimes, they were led by older children to travel, walking on rough and thorny roads. Although they all felt very tired and their feet were bleeding, they still endured it and said calmly with a smile; "I'm fine!"</p>
<p>Once, a young Spartan child stole a small fox from the mountains and played with it in the classroom. When the teacher came, he hid it in his clothes. At that time, the fox was extremely suffocated in the clothes! So he bit the child's chest, hoping to escape outside, but the child did not move at all, as if nothing had happened, letting it scratch and bite until it was bitten to death, and then he fell to the ground. At this time, his teacher discovered it and really praised the child's spirit of enduring pain. As for the Spartan girls, although they did not have as cruel training as the boys, they were all very healthy, and they also taught them to love the bravest boys and regarded it as a matter of pride. Therefore, the prosperity of Sparta was really based on their childhood.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Making Your Own Refrigerator (Part 1) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>It's the season of scorching summer again. The weather is so hot, and A Hui's school is about to end. So, these few days of big exams have already begun, and A Hui has to prepare her coursework for this semester properly.</p>
<p>A series of knocking sounds came from the kitchen, dispersing A Hui's mood for studying. It turned out that A Ming - her brother was nailing a large sheet of brand new tinplate to a large wooden box. "What is he doing?"</p>
<p>"Making a simple refrigerator." A Ming wiped the sweat from his head and replied.</p>
<p>"Homemade, it's not as good as buying one." A Hui wanted to stop her brother's work with this sentence, because the hitting sound was very harsh. It really disturbed her reading.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, you know, this year, buying an ordinary refrigerator costs four or five times as much. Not to mention an electric refrigerator, which costs thousands of dollars, scaring the poor to death. Why don't we make use of waste and make our own? The effect is not bad either."</p>
<p>So A Ming started working again. A sheet of tinplate was wrapped outside the wooden box, and every crack inside the wooden box was carefully filled with putty. He also put a kerosene can in the middle of the wooden box, and pressed fine sawdust tightly around it, turning it into a double-layered box. The refrigerator was thus completed, but it cost very little, because these raw materials were available in A Hui's home.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Shirley Temple's Autobiography (8) <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Ke Gan, you come closer, let me whisper something in your ear. That day I went to test the camera lens was really the happiest day of my life. That time was really fun, it's a pity that I can't tell you the details carefully. I had never been to a movie company's studio before, and my mother had never been there either. Therefore, my mother and daughter were both very excited. My mother's excitement was because she didn't know what would happen when I tested the lens, and she didn't know if I would be so scared that I couldn't speak or be at a loss. As for my excitement, it wasn't because of this, only that the studio was very big and very magical. It was like a large cave with a very high ceiling and no windows, much bigger than the cave in the story of Aladdin's lamp and the cave in the story of Snow White. Just because it was too big, I didn't know where to start looking. On this day, there were other children in the studio watching, who had also come to test the lens. But we didn't pay attention to testing the lens, and we were always looking around the studio, running around, opening and closing the door, pushing this door, passing through the door, and jumping up and down on the chairs, like monkeys. We found hats everywhere, but wearing them on our heads didn't suit us. In addition, we saw all kinds of ropes scattered on the floor, and we didn't know what they were for. There were also many very big lights, shining very brightly. If you looked at them for a minute or two, you couldn't open your eyes.</p>
<p>Then the most interesting and fun things followed. Mr. Raymond and Mr. Hayes (his name was Jack, said to be a movie producer) called us all to take off our clothes. It turned out that what they wanted to shoot was a film called "Baby Burlesks," and all the roles were played by us children. They wanted us to take off our clothes and put on something like a diaper, fastened in front with a safety pin. Immediately, the mothers took off their children's clothes one after another according to the words of the two gentlemen, and I of course followed suit. Everyone ran around wearing that diaper-like thing.</p>
<p>First, it was my turn to try. I had to stand in front of the camera, smile slightly, blink my eyes, dance a dance, swing my shoulders two or three times, and say "Yes, I love!" Ke Gan, this sentence was said in French. Just think about it, the first time I tried the lens, I spoke French, which was really beyond my expectations. I heard them say that the first single film of "Baby Burlesks" was called "War Babies," and they asked me to play a small French dancer in a coffee shop, so I couldn't speak English, but had to speak French. Now Miss Buckland has taught me French, so I already know the meaning of this French sentence, but at that time I didn't know it at all. Mr. Raymond called me to say it like this, and I just imitated his voice. After the test was over, Mr. Raymond said to my mother: "In a few days, I will let you know the results of today's test of Shirley."</p>
<p>All the children who read my autobiography can know when they read here that trying a lens is as easy as making a cake. At that time, I didn't feel scared at all, I just felt that everything was good, and my nerves were not tense. Do you know who was nervous? It was my mother! After we went back, do you know who was nervous again? It was my father! I bet you will be surprised when you hear this, because the old man didn't want me to step into the movie industry before, so why would he care now? It turned out that he thought we would never have this opportunity, so he had made up his mind not to indulge in this delusion. Now that he heard that I had tried the lens, it was clear that it had become a reality, so he hoped that I would step into the movie industry, more earnestly than my mother.</p>

<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>Children, the summer vacation is coming soon. During the long period of two months, you may as well spend some time reading a few famous literary works. Everyone has probably heard of the following four names, but some children may not have read them yet, because reading them will greatly help with composition and aspirations. Therefore, I dare to solemnly introduce them to you during this summer vacation: Because they are good books, if you have already read them, you can still read them again.</p>
<p>*   "Education of Love" - Written in diary form, it tells the story of what happened in a primary school in Italy in one year, telling you how everyone should love each other and help each other, etc. You must use the translated version of Mr. Liang Qichao from the Kaiming Bookstore.</p>
<p>*   "Remi, Nobody's Boy" - It writes about a deserted child who has gone through many difficulties to find a family and live a happy life. The difficulties in the middle can make people feel touched and motivated. Use the translated version of Ms. Lin Xueqing from the Children's Bookstore.</p>
<p>*   "The Fifteen Boys" - It writes about fifteen children who untied the cables in the boat to play, were drifted to a desert island, and sought a living by themselves. It is very exciting to read. It is more interesting than "Gulliver's Travels" and "The Adventures of Pinocchio."

<p>— A Han</p>
<p>In the promotion of the Peking opera improvement movement, the Yifeng Troupe, under the leadership of Zhou Xinfang, did shoulder its due mission. The plays "The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," "The Hatred of Concubine Xiang," and "The Two Emperors Huizong and Qinzong" have all won good reviews from public opinion. Although the performance of "Wen Suchen" emphasized the depiction of romantic love affairs, it still instilled correct ideas aimed at the current era in the interspersed scenes.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a rumor that the Yifeng Troupe is about to disband. Under the surprise of the author, I felt that this was going to be true, but after inquiring in many ways, it was indeed not completely groundless.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Carlton Theatre is indeed suitable for performing plays in terms of architecture, but in hot weather, the space must rely on air conditioning to drive away the heat, so it has been opening air conditioning in previous years. However, this year, ice prices are surprisingly expensive, and it is estimated that the consumption per day will be as high as five or six hundred yuan, which is of course not worth the loss. Therefore, it was decided to start a summer break from the eighth of next month, and reopen after the autumn cools down.</p>
<p>However, the problem lies in the transitional period of the summer break, because since the performances are stopped, the theater will naturally be unable to pay the contracted fee. This makes it necessary for the big and small stars to seek other ways out. At the same time, if they once find a way out, they cannot just sing for two or three months and then come back to join. Therefore, after consultation between the two parties, they temporarily announced the dissolution in the name of the summer break.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Xinfang will never give up the Carlton's site, and his thinking is more advanced than that of ordinary Peking opera practitioners. Therefore, he is preparing to reorganize the Yifeng Troupe with all his energy after the autumn cools down. At the same time, at this important moment of the War of Resistance, he feels that he must work harder to perform dramas with healthy consciousness in order to encourage the people's morale and strengthen the people's hearts!</p>
<h3 id="e108">From Song Halls to Peking Opera (Part 1) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the main conditions for a combination to become a song are: first, the lyrics; second, the tune; and third, the rhythm. These two conditions are indispensable for any kind of song. Or you may think that yaoban can be free from the constraints of rhythm, but this is because you do not know the reason for the sharp insight. You must know that even slow boards and fast boards do not need to be bound by the rhythm, but they cannot be inconsistent with the rhythm. At the same time, although yaoban does not use clappers, there is a considerable degree of moderation between the fast and slow, which can be known by those who know it, and it is difficult for those with shallow knowledge to thoroughly understand it.</p>
<p>Regarding the compilation of lyrics, there is no doubt that Kunqu is the most elegant, followed by Min opera and Jingyin Dagu, then followed by storytelling and Suzhou Tanci, and then followed by Peking opera, which are just like birds of a feather. (The new private plays newly compiled by Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu are not included in this example.) Bangzi, Shen opera, and the like are even more vulgar. As for the accuracy of the pronunciation of words, Kunqu is also the most particular. The four tones have already been arranged for you when filling in the score, so no matter how beginner you are, if the tune is not correct, you cannot go to the flute, and if the tune is correct, the word will not be inverted. When learning, you only need to pay attention to the yin and yang, sharp and round, and fanqie for the words. Other operas are probably mostly local accents and few official accents. (This official accent can also be said to be the Zhongzhou rhyme.) Dagu almost completely uses local accents, so it is only suitable for people who understand the local area to be able to hear the interest. Only Peking opera purely adopts the Zhongzhou rhyme. Or you may say, I have seen many people who don't understand a word of foreign language, but they like to watch movies. How can they hear the interest? It is very difficult for me to answer at once, but it can be decided that their purpose is definitely not to specifically listen to the words or listen to the songs, at least it always contains a large part of the meaning of watching the plot and scenery, so people who do not understand foreign languages ​​should say to watch a movie or watch a movie, and cannot say to listen to a movie. Originally, the saying to listen to a movie is only a northern dialect, and southerners usually say to watch a shadow play (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Movie Advertisements to be Inspected <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Film Inspection Committee will implement the inspection of film advertisements. The advertising sentences of each company's new films must be submitted in the original manuscript for inspection, and can only be published after passing. The motive for this move is that the film advertisements in a certain period mostly contain lustful sentences, which are quite suspected of being obscene.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Ownership of the Dancing Queen <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two: "A Page of Past History!"</p>
<p>"This—this is difficult for me to say. They are not considered anything in name—but they are still friends after all."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded slightly, but a trace of a smile appeared at the corner of his lips. This smile clearly deepened the old gentleman's embarrassment. The old man looked at his deceased niece and shook his head.</p>
<p>He continued, "Mr. Hawthorne, you must know that such friends are not within the five relationships that we have respected for thousands of years. I extremely disapprove of it. But Lilan is older, and after all, she is not my own daughter, how can I control her?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne sighed softly, offering a comforting sound, "Of course, you can't be blamed for that. In fact, in this Shanghai area, this kind of so-called friend has long been widely recognized as the sixth relationship!"</p>
<p>Li Zhiban shook his head repeatedly and sighed, "Abandoned and extravagant, doing everything for oneself!"... Shanghai is truly a place of all evils! But in my old-fashioned mind, it is still a bit shameful to talk about such friends."</p>
<p>Hawthorne glanced at him and nodded, "Mr. Li, you are truly a virtuous and upright gentleman... Apart from this Lu Jiansheng, were there any other 'friends' who provided for her?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure about that. But she certainly had a lot of friends."</p>
<p>"In that case, you wouldn't know if she had any other income, would you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I rarely come here, and now I am very polite to her, so of course I can't easily inquire about her."</p>
<p>"Indeed. So, among her many friends, how many do you know?"</p>
<p>Li Zhiban hesitated again and said, "I can't say much about this either. The day I arrived in Shanghai, I saw two young men in Western suits arguing with Lilan here. One was younger, said to be named Yu. The other was taller, and he has been coming in and out of here these past few days, but I don't know his name."</p>
<p>Hawthorne stood up, walked to the desk, and pulled open the drawer, taking out the several male photographs he had just discovered. Li Zhiban followed Hawthorne as he approached the desk. As soon as he saw the contents of the drawer, he seemed to be stunned.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Twenty Kinds of Storytelling Songs (Twelve Kinds) The Romance of the Western Chamber <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Crafted by Xiuyan</p>
<p>The Romance of the Western Chamber, a Yuan dynasty drama; written by Wang Shifu, based on Tang dynasty's Dao Zhen's "Story of Yingying." Although it is also a story of talented scholars and beautiful women, the descriptive technique in Romance of the Western Chamber, is refined and elegant, precisely as it should be; evidently superior to ordinary storytelling novels.</p>
<p>Among storytellers skilled in performing The Romance of the Western Chamber, there are Zhu Lan'an (deceased), Huang Yi'an, and He Keren. Lan'an is "elegant", Yi'an is "humorous", and Keren is "steady and practiced", each with their own unique strengths. However, no one has been able to fully capture the "charm" of Yingying, the "cleverness" of Hongniang, or the "literary talent and elegance" of Zhang Sheng.</p>
