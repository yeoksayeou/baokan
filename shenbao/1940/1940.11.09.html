<h3>甘納第　主力援英</h3>
<p>波斯頓　美國駐英大使甘納第、昨在此接見新聞記者、渠曾目擊英空軍之制勝、故認飛機出產乃屬最重要之防禦行動、甘氏雖贊成繼續援助英國、惟對於美國參戰則表反對、甘氏謂渠對於海外無立卽和平之望頗表悲觀、並稱外傳渠已辭職之說實屬無稽、渠現擬赴加利福尼亞及佛洛利達兩州休養、如倫敦方面對渠有所需要、則將於四十八小時內前往云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>太平洋聯防問題　美英澳三國成立協定　美國海軍得使用英澳根據地　遠東一旦有事實施對日封鎖</h3>
<p>倫敦　據可靠方面昨夜聲稱、英美澳三國現已議妥一太平洋防務協定、俾使隨時採取緊急行動、該協定之答題、係關於太平洋中之防務合作及海軍根據地之使用問題、惟堅強之新加坡軍港是否在使用範圍之內、即不得而詳、查太平洋聯防問題、已由美總統羅斯福、國務卿赫爾、英大使落洛爾安、澳洲公使理查　諸人、互相商討甚久、今乃進於完成、此間官方對於新協定內容之詳情、默不發言、但頗可相信其規定英美澳三國互相使用彼此在太平洋上之各海軍及空軍根據地、此决民中國抵禦繼續侵略之聯合行動、實因日本與軸心國簽訂軍事同盟有以促成之、照此决協定之規定、英美澳三國在遠東遇有危急時、當可對日本加施一種遠程之海軍封銷云（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　衆料官方將於數日內公佈關於英美兩國在遠東組織共同陣綫一事、詳細內容自須嚴守秘密、但消息靈通人士相信新加坡與達爾文港、均在共同陣綫範圍之內、美國海軍將管轄東太平洋領海、此間人士指稱、英國可抽調大量海軍艦隊在歐洲領海活動、另悉、英國可獲得美驅逐艦多艘、此間現已公開承認英美談判進行迄今已歷數星期、所以羅斯福與甘納第之保證英美兩國並無秘密協定一節、今已證明其爲競選手段、此外、美國復同時與墨西哥進行談判、討論美國使用墨西哥之海空軍根據地、另悉、美墨兩國間煤油問題、亦在此次談判中提出討論云、（八日海通電）</p>
<p>英美官方諱莫如深</p>
<p>倫敦　今日外間所傳英美澳三方對於在太平洋合作事、已在原則上臻於妥洽之說、此間官方並無所聞、據稱若干時日之前、美國務院人員。澳公使。及英大使曾彼此交換意見、但此種交換係完全非正式性質、不過爲互相闡明而已云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務院昨晚吾認倫敦所傳之消息、謂美英澳三國對太平洋之聯合防禦已成立協定、國務院某發言人指出、英澳外交代表曾與國務卿赫爾商討太平洋之局勢、惟據渠稱、國務卿當時拒絕與彼等討論細則云、赫爾曾屢决告新聞記者稱、美國從未與英澳外交代表表示仟何許諾、惟此間現正對美國已與英澳在太平洋上成立協定之謠言、作甚廣泛之批評、認爲此項協定或有已經成立之可能、衆信此項協定當包括美國海軍借用英澳在遠東之根據地、俾英美一日在太平洋受到攻擊時、三國可採取聯合行動云、（八日台衆社電）</p>
<p>反侵略政策始終不變　美對日態度益將強硬</p>
<p>華盛頓　世界各處對於羅斯福總統之一再獲選、莫不欣喜、獨三軸心國則小然、此可見軸心國承認侵略行爲、決不能得四半球之同情、卽使選舉結果有異於此、當然亦不能有此同情、惟若威爾基獲選、則目前與一月間新舊準備交替政務或梢停頓之時期、歐亞軸心國將利用之以推進其計謀、今羅氏連任、美國政策近數月來所表示之堅强、自連續而不稍間斷、就事態察之、國務卿赫爾確將留職、渠對侵略與歐亞新秩序之意見、已山渠於選舉運動時切實充分表明之矣、日外務省發言人須磨謂、美國對日政策須予修正、此言也、此間人十無論屬何黨派皆以爲然、惟美國對日政策所須修正者至少非在東京發言人所指之方面、如日本採取侵略性質新行動、則美國政策或將在另一方面修正耳、須磨以美國政策對日不友好爲言、此間觀察家乃相詢日、自一九二一年日本以武刀退行其國策以來、日本政策何時曾對美國利益表示友好乎、日浦之退出南華、此間人士現仍予以密切之注視、而求共內蓄之意義、若干言論家謂、日軍撤退必將移用於荷屬東印度、惟持論較鎭定者則信日本現不能作如此大規模之胃險行動、蓋日本在中國所啣咬者、較其所能嚼嚥者爲多、今乃不得小吐出若干、免使其在華陸電久受牙關緊閉之症而己、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福返白宮　召開重要會議　商討加緊援助中英步驟</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日自海德公園之別墅勝利地回返此間、並立卽與國防委員會進行商討、總統此决與國防委會之商討、達二小時又十五分鐘之久、衆信此决會議具有歷史價値，因美國或將立卽加緊對央國之援助也、衆並認美機一萬二千架輸央之舉或可提出起運、該會議告終後、總統並立卽召開高級會議、會中決定美國何種軍火得以售火、而不致妨害美國本身之自衛程序、衆信此項委員會乃在攷慮總統關於美國軍用機一萬二千架運出之提議、觀察家認爲羅斯福總統回歸華盛頓之第一决官方文告、將爲加速美國以軍火供應運央、某某數方面相信總統並決意採取同樣行動、增加對華援助、羅斯福總統昨日偕羅夫人回返華盛頓時、笑態可掬因渠已獲得在美國歷史中從未有過之榮譽也、渠對新聞記者云、余等回返此間雖較晏、然中心甚樂、汝等當知余等酷愛農村生活、惟就城市而言、余等愛居於華盛頓、實較其他城市爲甚也、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨返美京甫數小時、駐英美大使甘納第與國務卿赫爾已入見之、現傳在美英國採辦團刻與美總統晤商消息、巳引起總統此時正式考慮對英續予援助之猜測、（八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美國新政府　明年一月就職　赫爾國務卿可望蟬聯　內長伊克斯宣佈辭職</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國新取府將於明年一月就職、現此間已傳播關於新政府組織之謠言、內務部長伊占斯既於昨夜宣佈辭職、衆料內閣諸人皆將於年內步伊克斯之後塵、一般注竟現集中於國務院、有向國務卿赫爾詢其進退者赫爾答詞至爲審愼、惟衆信羅總統必挽留之、衆知赫爾亟思下野、故或將藉詞年老乞休、惟數月前赫爾尚謂在危急之秋、渠願爲國家利益作任何必要之犧牲、是以據一般懸測、赫爾可仍留職俾確保美國政策之一貫、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美內務部長伊克斯自一九三三年三月四日起任職至今、昨夜宣佈渠已辭職、庶羅斯福總統如有更易閣員之需要、得以自由分配、此爲渠辭職之唯一原因、至於維氏之再度獲選、固渠所甚欣幸者也云、伊現年六十六、自操律師業、初爲芝加奇報紙社員、自二十三歲起致力於市政革新政治、上决歐戰時、隨美國遠征軍第于三十五師赴法擔任靑年會工作、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福威爾基　週一廣播</h3>
<p>華盛頓　昨晚消息、羅斯福總統將在星期一歐戰紀念日發表二决廣播演說、第一决時間定在上午十一點正、第二决時間定在下午三時三十分、（八日合眾電）</p>
<p>紐約　共和黨失敗候選總統威爾基昨晚宣稱、渠在下星期一晚、將對全國作數小時之演說、藉以表明在比羅斯福總統三任期內、渠與無數信徒所將執行之政策、演說時間定在下午十一點三十分、（卽上海時間星期二上午十一點三十分）（八日合眾電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國共和黨委員會主席馬丁、昨日發表文告、略稱、共和黨準備擁護羅斯福、但以不背共和黨競選時發表之各項原則為條件、共和黨承認威爾基之領導、而不受胡佛及藍登等保守派之影響、馬丁希望共和黨於一九四一年國會選舉時、獲得領導地位云、（八日海通電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>今年之冬振</h3>
<p>時序變遷，朔風漸厲、酋曾有高氣壓一度來臨，凍斃者已纍纍，幸時猶深秋，即轉溫和，然如鹵昨之天氣，蓋已見初冬景象矣。回憶去年幾次大冷，道旁極寒而死，報不絕書。旋由慈聯會出而舉辦急振，逐日於晡刻散放麵包，俾以食物所生之熱力，而禦外來之寒氣。當其散放之際，但見扶老携幼，萬頭攅動，想見待振之衆，與夫收效之宏，存活當不在少數也。本年物價之高，一般生活之艱，允非去年所能比擬，因之街頭流離之民，景象悽其，亦甚於昔。而一念「負暄坐晴簷，煦煦春滿袍，」之神情，同是處嚴冬一則何其逸豫，一則何其徬徨。苦樂相去，奚啻霄壤。故若必待餓死凍死者若干輩，而後思及振濟，夫豈仁者之用心，獨不能先憂而憂耶！</p>
<p>夫救濟美名也，常難循其貫。惻隱之心，人皆有之，而不能見乎事。若必待循名覈實，方肯發心爲救濟，則又將索諸枯魚之肆。故有善心者，但當發善願，善舉固應選擇，而善名不必我居。至有因懷疑善舉之不能盡其實，堅囊不破，惻隱無心，而忘其人羣互助之義務，亦非人心之所應爾。故昔有「破錢爲功德」，只求自己之施捨，不聞事實之如何者矣。然在辦理善舉者，宜如何力行以副出捐人之願望，而使「款不虛糜，事歸實際」，愼無以爲善之名，而有濟惡之實；亦無以用人不當，而叢脞積允。募捐難，辦振允難，此在稍有辦振經騐者同有此感。</p>
<p>以言冬振，急振也。即名急振，自應急其所急，若必待事到臨頭，方使發動，則必有凍死者矣，則必有餓死者矣。歷來冬振則有庇寒所，供給其衣食，療治其疾病，戒除其嗜好，使流離之民，有棲止之所，無風雪之患，誠善舉也。但款鉅，一也；孤島之內，欲覓一空曠之地。搭廠收容，而不易得，二也。勢非由團體出而主持不可；三也。而又往往限於名額，經費，有收小勝收容不勝容之感，四也。此外尚有散給衣米票，衣票即可得衣禦寒，然至無食之時，髯願挨凍，不勝忍飢，而付諸典質；此可見食允爲重要，故有米票之散給。但赤貧雖有米票，仍無以爲炊，又不可生食，於是有煮振。煮振辦理允難，一則秩序維持不易，再則煮粥須厚可以植箸；三則天未明已須煮粥待發，若非主持之人熱心毅力，常不易著成效。施粥之人材不易得，施粥之地點亦難覓，故去年慈聯會散發麵包，其先仍助以薑湯，蓋亦以麵包無熱粥之可禦寒，而小得不以熱湯相調劑。此外與其散米票，何如散粥票飯票之爲愈。粥票，在中國濟生會早有發行，的定若干粥店，憑票給粥。惟飯票尚無有舉辦：即有辦理者則爲平價發售之白飯。宜可如粥票之仿行，的定若干飯店，憑票發飯，而向發券之團體，收回飯資。粥飯票之長處，即在以衆人自己所發心，稱其力量之厚薄，向發券之善團購得粥飯票，散給於貧民，此所謂以衆人之力救濟衆人，較之單靠善團之力，其收效自更普遍而周至。茲有鑒於今年生活壓迫之嚴重，飢寒交集窮民之衆多，深望樂善之士，早事籌振，無待隆冬歲暮，飢寒路斃相接，始言救濟也。</p>

<p>羅斯福總統夫人「伊利諾羅斯福」傳記作者，羅倍勃拉克曾說：「如果共和黨候選人威爾基要當選美國大總統，他所應戰勝的不止一個羅斯福，—而是兩個。羅斯福總統此决雖不實際參加競選，但是那第二位羅斯福倒也是很可怕的哩。」</p>
<p>第二位羅斯福是誰？無疑的就是羅斯福總統夫人。她本來也姓羅斯福，嫁個丈夫也是羅斯福，因之夫婦倆的族侄輩，這個羅斯福，那僩也是羅斯福，往往叫人弄不淸楚。威爾基旣敵不過男羅斯福，而實際上吃女羅斯福虧的地方着實不少。羅斯福夫婦一搭一擋，現在已權如泰山的做第三决白宮主人了。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統夫人，這决公然爲丈夫參加總統競選，在歷史上是很罕見的。其實這不過是他的表面工作，暗地裹，她在平時，不聲小響地早就完成了許多仟務。民主黨前輩宣傳主仟米乞爾遜，向來不喜歡女子參政的，他對於羅斯福夫人却另眼看待，推崇她爲世界上最偉大的女政治家。民主黨全國代表大會前任主席法萊，稱羅斯福夫人無論在男的方面，或女的方面，是政治人物中有數的頂兒尖兒。</p>
<p>伊利諾羅斯福的「可怕」之處，分析起來，却有下面四點</p>
<p>（一）她的品性：伊利諾羅斯福可說是美國最負聲望的一個女子。她在報紙上主持，「我的日子」一欄，每日自撰文章，雖沒有政治意味，而極具勢力，數百萬讀者都以她的言行爲表率。一九三三—三四年時，那班稱她爲「可怕」者，現在對她態度一變，敬慕有加了。</p>
<p>（二）她在婦女界中的領導地位：不僅在選舉之時，她爲婦女界的領袖，卽在平日，她做各種預備工夫，歷來有女中翹楚之目。在她丈夫仟紐的州長之前，她奔走演說，使婦女們對於他們的施政方針發生興味。因她努力的結果，民主黨婦女部成爲一個政治上有力的組織。</p>
<p>（三）她與靑年爲友：在美國全國各領袖中，伊利諾羅斯一福以最多的時間，與最大的精神，澈底硏究靑年問題。她對於各種靑年運動，常寄以理智的同情，使羅斯福總統與全國靑年，互相發生了解，絕無隔閡。這决大選之中，已屆選舉年齡的許多靑年，粉紛擁護羅斯福，這多是他太太平日活動的成效哩。</p>
<p>（四）她的政治戰略：歷年民主黨競選，沒有一决沒有她在內策劃大計。</p>
<p>此外，她每當競選之時，除了自己四出演說外，對於黨員的鼓勵慰勉，基金的籌集，當地情形的硏究等，無不悉心以赴，而成爲民主黨中的柱石。至於她的演說才能，在美國可謂數一數二。本屆競運發動之後，民主黨各代表到處遊說，他們都感覺到厭倦乏味。因爲一屆如此，二屆如此，現在三屆又要如此。大家幾乎有些支撑不住了。於是一致希望羅斯福總統能親目出馮，打一下嗎啡針，無奈他老人家搖着鵝毛扇，優游自得，遲遲不肯起駕。一决，華萊演說時，臺下忽然蠢蠢欲動，聽衆對演說者報以噓噓輕侮之聲。幾位代表面面相覷，犬家都拿不出主意來，其時羅斯福總統夫人亦在座，就有人提議請羅太太登臺演說。羅太太當仁不讓，在這緊要關頭就上了塲。說也奇怪，她祇用幾句極簡單的話，就把聽衆的心理抓住，不上幾分鐘大家聽得心悅誠服，臺下鳥雀無聲了。當然在塲的新聞記者都說，聽衆會如此的受演說感動，眞是罕見的現象。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人在各地組織婦女團體，指導婦女運動，叉是一位健將。民主黨婦女在各地設立擁護羅斯福總統的大小會社，聲勢殊爲浩大，使威爾基束手無策。</p>
<p>伊利諾羅斯福於一九二二年，爲了她丈夫和家庭的緣故，參予政治活動。直到現在，仍舊爲了這兩種原因，不放棄政治生涯。她的基本觀念，認爲鎮，城，州和國，都是由家庭爲出發，而是家庭的縮形罷了。如果一個婦女對於政府不發生興味，那末就難望在家庭間能充份盡責。她把這個主張到處灌輸在婦女們的頭腦中，不論貧富貴賤，她總把道個理論去打動她們，叫美國的婦女對於政治發生接觸。</p>
<p>羅斯福在紐約州長任中，他太太常和他一同出外巡視。後來羅斯福因爲身息瘋癱，步履維艱，一切視察，監獄學校等事，需要州長前去時，咸由羅斯福夫人庖代。起初她弄不慣，認爲討厭之至，後來倒也樂此不疲了。現在她常說：「這是我從來沒有受到的最好敎育呢。」一九三三年後，她成爲她丈夫的不具銜的巡視員，舉凡聯邦政府所辦的一切事務，都在她巡察範圍之內。</p>
<p>凡是她所學到的，她總傳授給別人。所以美國婦女對於政府，政府與家庭，與小孩子們，與她們丈夫所經營事業的關係，總較別國的婦女允爲了解，認識得淸楚。這都不得不歸功於羅斯福夫人的灌輸之功了。</p>
<p>關於這决的競選，她曾有警句道：『這件事有關國家安危。每個投票人在選舉之前，應該先認識淸楚「在那一個人，那一黨之下，國家纔能獲得最大的安全」』這幾句話眞是說得十分透澈玲琍，無怪大家都要跟着她跑了。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人最喜歡與廣大的民衆，親自通信，使民衆與總統之間發生好感。一方面把民間的渴望，下層階級的呼籲，使簾高堂遠的總統，也得澈底明瞭，不致有隔膜之虞。</p>
<p>羅斯福瘋癱病愈之後，他母親叫他從白宮遷居海特公園鎭故鄉靜養，這是慈母之愛于，其情殷切，可謂無微不至。羅斯福夫人則以爲羅斯福如能恢復政治生活，則其病體的復元，亦必較快。從此姑娘之間，未免意見參商。羅斯福夭人便把這個問題，叩諸他丈夫的私人醫生特萊伯。特萊伯回答道：「他還是要求生活呢，還是使精神方面死亡？倘然他要求生命，那末儘可以活下去。凡是活命的人都會感受疲勞的因疲勞而使我受傷，決不會超過因受傷而疲勞呢一結果羅斯福夫人便獲得了勝利。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統夫人精神健旺，頭腦淸晰。她在一天中不知要做多少事，見客哩，集會哩，著作哩，忙個不休。她自己說？一人如欲應付各種事務，不使精神疲於奔命，唯一的要點，就是在「怎樣鍛鍊你自己。」一天，她正在和同志們討論如何進行婦女工作方案，羅斯福總統忽然來了個電話，要和她有事相商。他們倆在電話中討論了關於別一個問題的事，歷時頗久。談畢，她放下電話筒又繼續着討論這個婦女工作案，她立刻從電話打斷的那一點起，頭頭是道的賡續磋商，一絲也不混亂，其頭腦的淸楚，可想而知了。</p>
<p>七年以來，羅斯福夫人與朝野諸色人等普接，對於各階級份子的心理，洞曉無遺，此外她又從別方面獲得許多消息。這種消息當然有許多是不甚「中聽的，她總一箍腦兒的吿訴總統。她以爲她丈夫貴爲總統，高高在上，包圍在白宮的高堂大厦，近旁的侍衛密探中，左右雖儘多明達之士，但也難保沒有專門猜透在上者的心理，一味的「是，是，是……」的；在另一方面，總統自己也明知卽使是他的政敵，當了面，往往也不肯直談無諱，於是他常說：「任何人總會把任何事情吿訴伊利諾的。」羅斯福夫人的重要，在她丈夫輕描淡寫的一句話中，已透露無餘了。</p>

<h3>英金需要轉廣</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、走勢不定、人心受隱的之流言影響、意旨互異、大致投機商午前競扒美滙、而外行等供塞甚爽、價未過分見緊、而洋行及港電等力扒先令、是以始終軟化、並套做滙兌、計合三元七角四分、晚收結果英金三便士八七五、美滙六元〇六二五、較上日英縮〇三一二五、美則無更、期貨亦然、</p>
<p>美匯買賣俱有</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均升〇六二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬等平定、美對英大半分、對滬不更、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士九〇六二五、美滙六元〇六二五、比上日收市、俱乏上落、開後市面硬化、此因投機商來市出售、有利亦滿懷賣意、計本月份美滙投機商出外行爲六元〇九三七五、日行三井及麥加利人有札亦屬此價、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅增百分之〇五〇、時投機商突又一致購結、價乃轉緊、本月份美匯外行售予改爲六元〇六二五、下月份已吿六元〇三一二五、同時洋行亦欲扒納、計麥加利售予本月份先令軟至三便士八七五、後某美行仍肯六元〇六二五塞予投機商、致潛勢吿穩、午後現貨英金三便士八九〇六二五、美匯六元〇六二五、比晨開美平、英縮〇一五六二五、</p>
<p>英金始終緊俏</p>
<p>後市初况微軟、美匯曾吿六元〇三一二五後因港電吐售、價復回平、計港電出有利本月份美滙六元〇六二五、而六元〇九三七五亦有交易、惟英金則始終緊俏、晚收現貨價爲三便士八七五、美匯六元〇六二五、本月份與現貨價同、下月份英金三便士八五九三七五、美滙六元〇三一二五、較之隔昨收市、英金期現均縮〇三一二五、美滙毫無榮辱、</p>
<p>香港美匯不定</p>
<p>香港八日（週五）電、今晨國市開盤吿半、美滙則呈動盪、英滙現期貨及日匯現貨均無上落、美滙現貨縮〇六二五、爲二十三元二五、遠期不動、仍站二十三元一二五、申滙現貨降一元、爲三百八十二元、（昨收爲三百八十二元）、十時平定、美滙現貨回硬〇六二五、爲二十五元三一二五、遠期不動、午收告半、美匯現貨鬆一二五、爲二十三元四三七五、申滙現貨升二五、爲三百八十四元、下午二時三十分開盤平定、美匯現貨回軟〇六二五、爲二十三元三七五、遠期無市、其餘亦無變動、</p>
<p>天津英平美縮</p>
<p>天津八日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、倫敦電匯仍開三便士九〇六二五、紐的電滙軟〇三一二五、爲六元〇六二五、申匯降七角五分、爲九十九元二角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤猛賤三元半、爲八十六元五角、</p>
<h3>傍晚賣風突起　金市欲漲又止</h3>
<p>昨現余烚赤暗盤、初尚盤高、乃外匯時呈軟狀、銀號等力進、價賴維持、且午後開出允稱堅昂、不意傍晚賣風一起、價遂撳低、聞證券帮首吐、金銀號多頭俱出、收盤僅五千五百二十七元、比上日軋落十三元、全日的二千五百兩交易、銀樓飾金終則不動、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌十三元</p>
<p>晨初以匯市呈鬆、價遂微見壓落、計錢兌業出銀號二十兩、爲五千五百二十元作開盤價、不久銀號買進而回高、計入金號三十兩、爲五千五百四十五元、嗣因錢兌業賣意頓萌、漲勢稍挫、訐證券帮塞予金號二十兩、退達五千五百二十八元、後銀號幫續吸若干、兼外匯已轉緊軟、並利多空氣吹至、人心較堅、計證券帮入金號二十兩、挺達五千五百六十二元、迨至午收銀號對做十兩、尙吿五千九百六十元、市面殊穩、午後初閣愈昂、銀號進金號十兩、爲五千五百七十五元、未幾證券帮入銀號二十兩、再升十元、爲五千五百八十元高價、嗣報匯市回平、證券帮先售、立降至五千五百三十元、計錢兌業滙銀號二十兩、吿五千五百四十元、加之金銀號多頭斯時猛塞、價不支續挫、計證券幫出銀號爲五千五百二十五元、結果銀號對做十兩、僅五千五百二十七元、作晚收價、比上日跌十三元、全日六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十兀、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金兌價未動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、本日仍無變動、計大向行縣五百七十元、新同行與上價相彷、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣鼓不起勁</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價漲後回落、英美金鎊始曾高起一元、終則回平、英金票仍鮮交易、市價呆定如故、美金票始曾退至十五元八角八分、但旋卽步漲、一度高達十六元零二分、卒又退爲十五元九角半、比上日終落五分、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票又趨下落、晚市退爲一元五角一分、朝鮮票趨勢亦軟、晚市退爲十元一角九分、</p>
<p>糧食</p>
<h3>今晨又有洋米可到　洋米昨日依然在操縱中</h3>
<p>華綸洋行海達輪、自暹邏運米一萬七千包、來滬等情已誌昨報、茲據該公司宣稱、改今晨八時定可到埠、停靠北京路外灘碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨市業中壟斷、業外操縱、浮戶盲從、投機活躍、市面允見混亂、且據洋商宜稱定貨船位困難外、最近又須增加水脚兵險各費、每包計加四元餘、故定價立卽喊高三元、此爲西貢運米船隻、大都操諸法商之手、遂致爲所欲爲、市上回籠原包亦乘機加起二三元、新交易的有一千四五百噸、回籠近千噸、一號西貢十二月份前定開七十二元者昨至七十五元、又二號前開七十元者昨至七十三元、即裝一號亦開七十六元七角至七十七元、定價旣漲、現貨在上午霎那間已高半元、及後再兼本街實銷互相爭進、形勢愈緊、一路上騰、迄中市若二號寳塔脾銀行棧貨開出六十四元五角之高價、計升元半至二元、嗣後一般多頭因見價格已高、買氣較衰、同時又有原根大批拋出不下五六千包、而乘高出籠者復多、冉冉落低、至收市較之價貶近元、所以結果收盤行情實增元砠、但至下午、叉有人起而操縱、復高起一元光景、</p>
<p>新粳尖及茶種野稻等、仍以到貨不多、共祇一千三四白石、貨主心思旣堅、而買方爲恐向隅、納胃亦亟、致市形依然俏色、各價續提一二元之巨、計團新粳原包八十七兀半、决至八十四元、斛見八十二元、决七十九元、菉種八十元、七十九元、野稻特八十五元、八十四元、杜尖原包七十六元、斛見七十二元、至七十元、不過羊尖因受洋米牵制影響平乎而已、原包七十元、斛見六十七元、</p>
<p>糯米現際貨緊俏之時、除酒戶及飯擔實銷頗見栗碌外、更有大戶吸收、故市面亦然挺秀元砠、國元開七十六元、洋糯七十四元半至七十二元、</p>
<h3>大批洋粉　傳將到滬</h3>
<p>現粉交易、依然淸閑、而市面亦平淡如故、查一號粉廠盤、迄未變動、除供給本街日常需用外，客銷檳持未開、回籠貨各牌亦祇有喊價而無實銷、洋粉市面、則已暗中步鬆、因市傳大批洋粉、將於十五日左右到滬、爲日無幾、人心未免虛萎、聞高牌洋粉祗售十八元八角、尙無整額受主、統市兩廠批出共八千餘包、及洋粉二三千包、市面寂靜如常、</p>
<p>小麥市況仍寂、日廠方面、以原價收進、近郊麥一二百包、而市塲貨喊價須二十七元、因其運入租界殊多風難、各種費用甚巨、故相差竟達五六元、聞華廠以目下生產不多、原料旣無法暢收、故亦觀望不前、致市面再趨檳局、</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<h3>豆麻生仁北來南運</h3>
<p>八日進口　黄豆四百六十包、核桃三百六十包、均天津來、生仁四百包、花生一百二十包、均烟台來、</p>
<p>九日出口　豆子三百包、芝蔴四白七十包、蔴油一百聽、生油一百聽、生仁一百包、均運香港、</p>
<p>紗花</p>
<h3>港銷續而不斷　棉紗漲勢加厲</h3>
<p>紗市經堅、月漲風漸漸前進、此因香港方面、雖無躉批交易、然零星購辦、繼續不懈、因此之三二支及四二支、十支粗細紗需求殷切、且售價殊昂、照此比例、二十支紗價較爲廉宜、所以有一部份心思轉變看好、又說市塲二十支雙馬廠單籌碼、業已减縮五六千包之譜、但如目前二十支紗銷路不擴大、非至實銷起、市面不能昂騰、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日午後人氣甚昂、檯面尚佳、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千二百二十元、微漲至一千二白二十八元、此時議論謂美國貸款又有八十萬成立、此項消息利空、賣力活動壓迫稍加、跌至一千二百十七元、然其價一鬆、脫售較缺、賣方反思扒補、由此籌碼一緊市價迅速上升至一千二百三十四元、嗣後獲利出檔稍疲、收盤價爲一千二百三十一元、查半日間統計四千四百十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十一元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>午後紗市良好漲風繼續前進、紗市交易所中二十支雙馬行市、做開爲一千二百三十七元、成交四十包、人心鞏固、今日有棉紗五白九十件運香港、</p>
<h3>本棉來源無望</h3>
<p>現棉交易雖稀、但大心樂觀、良以存棉日薄、而各路來源無望、所來者都係零星額子、不過目前廠家納胃求開、需要一來、市價當有看高可能也、</p>
<p>疋頭</p>
<h3>客幫辦熱銷貨</h3>
<p>廠布昨市趨勢堅強、人心良好、本街同業及囤戶賣買頗繁、客幫擇熱銷各貨、亦有搜進、售盤細布細斜平定、粗布怡和貨亦平本廠輕重磅跌一角至二角半、漂染布價略有參差、春令紗綫府網陸續已有訂出、鴻章廠期貨條索府綢開價每碼一元二角半、光中等廠現墊貨市上均有成交、本街成交各貨六白餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦細布藍布綫呢等二百餘件、閩粤幫辦粗布斜紋色布二百數十件、今日有疋頭五百三十件運香港、</p>
<h3>駝斯錦呢大衣　—繼馬褲呢而與—</h3>
<p>昨呢絨走銷甚旺、惟南京幫因呢絨運送艱難、漸鬧荒象、聞上海售二十三四元一碼之怡和馬褲呢、南京市價可售三十三四兀、一般掮客有鑒於斯、一星期或十日、隨身帶五六套或三四十碼、往返販售者頗衆、</p>
<p>駝斯錦呢、近來趨勢頗形鋒俏、行情堅昂異常、來路貨每碼躉批現交售四十四元、邊頭織有西文字者爲四十五元半、申織本廠貨、普通售二十四五元、頭號爲三十元左右、馬褲呢行情較平疲、趨勢咸不若駝斯錦爲俏活、按目下中西裝夾大衣、不的而同、駝斯錦風行已超過馬褲呢矣、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<h3>黑瓜子轉跌</h3>
<p>黑瓜子近以去路欠活、市場下游、降去五六元不一、如大片濟魁子現售一百零五元、徐魁子九十六元、中式九十元左右至八十六七兀、大連子七十八元、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>洋糖囤倂復起</h3>
<p>昨糖市以有新囤下下塲吸收、趨勢續升、現貨二四粗白本棧七十一元五角、外棧爲七十一元至七十一元三角、升三角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十二元三角至五角、東棧七十一元五角至七角、計升七角、DY嘜東棧六十七元一角至二角、亦升七角、HX嘜西棧六十七元、東棧六十六元八角、升四角、MH嘜東棧六十三元、H嘜赤砂東棧五十三元、荷綿白高貨RA嘜七十一元、决貨BS嘜六十八元、荷赤現貨五十五元至五十五元四角、十一月十八打單者五十五元三角至五角、計升四五角一共成交計五千餘包、</p>
<p>煤炭</p>
<h3>煤球又加廠盤　—每担七元六角—</h3>
<p>義泰興煤球、近日因原料飛貴、新貨水脚每噸達三十三先令、（的合法幣白元以上）、成本攸關、故自昨日起廠盤暫加八元、同業自車每噸一百四十元、門莊送到每噸一百五十二元，每担七元六角、至於原料擬設法謀復原、以發火耐燒爲主要、聞其他小廠日內亦將加價云、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>平白鐵昂俏　點錫續漲</h3>
<p>平白鐵市面、近因内河帮本街囤戶及建築帮零星用戶等有所點綴、致行盤異常昂俏、刻七尺八九八九角、六尺七元七八角、而市存有限、兼之海外來貨已絕、勢在必好、</p>
<p>點鍚行情、受港地來路影響、本埠現貨頗感軋缺、以致同業心思高昂、標準逐趨續漲、昨九九九成花色喊一千五百元、由本街之零星買戶去路較多、同業及躉批殊稀、</p>

<h3>法租界法院被攝取　外部提嚴重抗議　發方破壞協定應負全責　護法之推檢等均已退出</h3>
<p>法租界法院現狀、自昨日起、已發生變更、江蘇高等法院第三分院及上海第二特區地方法院、於昨日在法捕房戒備及日憲兵之支持下、竟被强迫接收」法總領事馬傑里、且已授命哈瓦斯通訊社發表聲明、公然官布與日方妥協、將兩院移轉「管轄、」於是民國廿年七月廿八日中法所訂法租界法院協定十四條、遂被片面破壞矣、</p>
<p>外部聲明　嚴正立場</p>
<p>重慶八日電、關於攫取上海法租界中國法院事、外交部發言人今日特發表談話如下、本部頃劇法方通知上海法租界當局、業於本月七日、訂立協定、允許某方接受租界內之中國法院、並已於今日上午實行接收云云、查關於此事我方曾向法方一再述明、如法租界內中國法院破攫取、不但中國居民之身體財產、遭遇桎梏、卽外僑之權益、亦將受其危險、疊經要求法方嚴拒、並注意其對於此事所負之嚴重責任、乃法方竟仍屈服、不惜破壞民國廿年七月廿八日關於上海法租界內設置中國法院之協定、而非法移交、本部已向法方提出嚴重抗議、在上述情形之下、我政府自不得不令江蘇高等法院第三分院、及上海第二特區地方法院、在法租界內暫行停止行使其職務、此後法租界內自稱爲中國法院之任何機關、當然非法、其所有裁判及其他任何行動、一律無效、一切責仟、應由法方完全負担、</p>
<p>首先侵入高三分院</p>
<p>昨日上午十時二十分、法租界西愛咸期路二十三弄高三分院弄口、突駛來租界防軍照會第二五一號及第三八二號汽車二輛、司機均穿日憲兵制服、以及其他黑牌照會汽車三輛、當即跳下日方便衣人員十二名及其他華人二十名、原高三分院首席檢察官喬萬選、與特二法院首席檢察官孫紹康·亦在其內、擁入高三分院、至法租界公董局法律顧問處主任顧問社根、則於事前先行到院守候、</p>
<p>院長乞援不得要領</p>
<p>當若輩抵院時、詹紀鳳亦偕入、傳聞詹係所謂「接收」法租界法院之「特派員」、復傳耿嘉基當前往「接收」時、亦在其内、此外尙有新「委」之「推事」多名在內、其時高三分院院長楊鹏、適未在院、由其寓所中得悉此事、當卽電話向法租界當局請援、乃法租界當局、含糊其詞、幾經交涉、未得要領、</p>
<p>首檢不耐擅自移交</p>
<p>當時法租界方面、曾在高三分院門口、駐有安南兵十名、及三十二號鐵甲車一輛、此外尙有大批武裝巡捕、對於强制接牧法院之事、並未加以阻止、而多時不到該院之首席檢察官喬萬選、擅自辦理「移交」、同時、由若輩接收人員取出塡就之「委任狀」十餘張、要求該院推事接受委任、至中午十一時四十分許、始相繼離去、而高三分院至此卽變質矣、</p>
<p>多數法官守正不阿</p>
<p>當若輩在高三分院實行一「接收」時、卽以高三分院名義、電話通知特區第二法院、囑該院長陳懋咸、赴高三分院辦理移交、當時陳院長未允前往、但因環境惡劣、僅允在特二院守候、未幾、陳院長以法當局態度不明、無法挽回危局、悄然離去、推事隨陳院長而去者、有廖彥·李良·陳自觀·余長資·孫彭銜·馬義述·邱煥瀛·朱楚哲·蔣禮泉·等人、並悉當昨日上午十一時許、「高三分院書記官」更以電話通知特二法院、謂下午前來「接收」等語、</p>
<p>第二特院下午被佔</p>
<p>至下午一時十分、第二特區地方法院門前、叉有汽車五輛駛來、除上述防軍照會車兩輛、另有孫紹康之黑牌照會第一一一〇三號汽車等三輛、跳下日方便衣人員六名、及華人孫紹康等十餘人、擁入特區地方法院、當時孫紹康並曾雇祥生出差汽車第一七〇七三號載送茶點水菓到院款待、於是特二院一如高三分院、亦隨之變質、</p>
<p>特二監獄隨以變更</p>
<p>在特二法院附近、亦卽在法公董局法律顧問處對面之馬斯南路特二法院監獄、於昨日下午三時許、亦由日人兩名、及在該院任候補看守所長之黄亞强者、暨其他華人六七名、並隨同法捕房人員與法租界主任顧問杜根等、要求監獄長趙信宇「移交」、趙監獄長適患病在床、迫不得已、乃將印信·公欵·警衛槍械·以及獄犯名冊等「移交」、而由該黄亞强代理「監獄長」、</p>
<p>尚有多人今日退出</p>
<p>致此次新址之一委任狀一、計（一）高三分院方面有「高三分院院長」喬萬選、「首席檢察官」劉肇福、「民庭長」王鑑、「刑庭長」譚理鳴等、（二）特二法院方面、有「院長」孫紹康、「首席檢察官」周達人、「民庭長」張民生（又據另一消息、張在院聞訊卽出院而去）、「刑庭長」袁孝根等、此外其他二院之「推事」及「檢察官」等亦各給以塡就之「委任狀」、但是吾接受此項「委任」、現尙未悉、衆信今日當有多數推事·檢察官·決心擁護中央、準備退出、特二監獄內同人、亦將於今日起推出、又特二院全體執達員、昨日表示不願蟬聯、</p>
<p>戒備加緊搜查嚴密</p>
<p>法租界內兩法院昨日所起之鉅變、法租界當局事先實早有所聞、毫不加以拒絕、當時法當局在西愛咸斯路之高三分院弄口、除原駐第三二號重鐵甲車外、復加派安南兵十名、在西愛咸期路兩端、如金神父路·亞爾培路口、亦均派有大批巡捕警備、搜查進出行人、至於特二法院門前、停有十七號鐵甲車、馬斯南路口特二監獄前、則停有二十三號鐵甲車、此外附近四週各馬路、則派駐大批武裝巡捕警戒、搜查車輛行人、</p>
<p>美報記者攝影被阻</p>
<p>當高三分院破「接收一時、英文大美晚報記者許華芝、前往探視、經過西愛咸斯路該院時、被守衛該院之探捕、搜查達四决、嗣後許袖出照相機對準該院攝取照片時、爲法捕所阻、並加以拘捕、帶至捕房、後發現其照片並未攝成、巧予釋放、惟平明社記者、前往薛華立路第二特院視察時、見有日籍新聞記者數人、反復攝取該院照片、而法捕並未加以禁止、</p>

<p>自由辯論</p>
<h3>婦女往那裏去？（一）　婦女回家庭去</h3>
<p>— 祺齋</p>
<p>（二）婦女與心理：婦女除了「生育特能」之外，心理上還有「母愛特能」。這和「生育特能」一樣的是一種「種族本能」。假使婦女沒有「母愛特能」，人類就不能長大而致絕滅。婦女受「母愛特能」的衝動，就自然的願放棄一切，犧牲一切去做孩子的保護者，所以王完白醫師曾稱「母親是世界上第一等護士」。這是婦女特有本能的需耍，像飲，食，性一樣，不能制止的。何林華（Hollingworth）蒲分白（Poffenberger）認「人生最殘酷刑罰之一，爲單獨監禁，」我敢說：「婦女最殘酷刑罰之一，爲不准婦女愛她子女。」</p>
<p>（三）婦女與社會：社會是一個羣衆的集團，羣衆的單位是個人，而婦女是產生許多個人成爲羣衆的人，所以婦女是「社會之母」。社會的單位旣是個人，那末社會的良好與吾，全看個人的良好與吾而定。假使「社會之母」不能得到一個合理的環境（能台於婦女生理心理上需要的環境，）一定影響到子女的健康與智力，於是社會也就小會良好了。</p>
<h3>婦女上社會去</h3>
<p>— 亦蕙</p>
<p>（二）婦女與心理：世界上的父母，沒有不愛他們的兒女的。但是有許多人却以爲愛兒女乃是母親的特能。其實，母親對於孩子的所以特別顯得愛護，大部分的原因還是因爲母子的接觸比父子的接觸更多。同樣的「個母親，對於她親生的兩個孩子，假如是她自己看護的就比較給乳母看護的更愛護的多。從心理方面來說，每個婦女都有她不同的個性和特長。我們不能假定，凡是做母親的都是善於敎養兒童的。一個兒童的長成，專靠着母愛是不够的。合理的敎養方法是正如母愛一樣地重要。况且，從事於職業的婦女，是依然可以愛他們的孩子的。在那最努力於托兒所建設的先進國家裏，許多地方貼着這樣的一個標語：「沒有一件東西能替代母親的乳和母親的愛！」托兒所裹的孩子，並不是孤兒院裏的孩子。他們在父母親一天的工作完畢之後，都可以回去盡量地享受家庭之樂和父母之愛。誰說有職業的婦女不能愛她的孩子？</p>
<p>（三）婦女與社會：個人的良好與吾，可以影響社會。社會的良好與吾，也可以影響個人。因此，婦女一方面要藉着優良的敎育，使兒童對於社會起好的作用。另一方面，她也要努力於直接改造社會的工作，因爲進步的社會可以對孩子發生良好的影響，同時，黑暗的社会也可以叫孩子堕落。誠如伍君所說，社會乃是羣眾組成的。可是，我們也要記得，婦女本身就是群眾的一部份。他們占了群眾的半數。他們對於社會的貢獻，絕不僅是間接的。他們乃是推動社會進步的不可少得直接的力量。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>弟弟的夢</h3>
<p>— 流沙</p>
<p>自由談會經發表過一篇『我的弟弟』的文章，他的弟弟生活的進步使我異常感動。禁不住手癢起來，因爲我聯想到我自己的弟弟。但說來慚愧，我的弟弟旣不像那位弟弟的聰明和進步。抑且是個蠢笨和虛榮心十足，阿Q精神很濃厚的靑年。我本不想揭發他，因此乃是一件於己很不體面的事。然而讀到雷星君警惕的話：『我們厭惡黑暗，但我們不懼怕黑暗。』使我覺得退步而有害的潮流需要嚴懲和不斷打擊。所以，我的胡扯也許對於讀者多少有點實益的。</p>
<p>閒話少說，讓我來介紹我的弟弟吧！</p>
<p>他是個中學生，學問並不好，體格也並不怎樣健全。然而他很驕傲，很愛當衆出風頭</p>
<p>有一個時期他幾乎大半天生活在鑑賞自己的尊容。他曾自誇：他的臉蛋和頭髮不但酷肖電影明星梅熹，而且有點兒像文學健將郁達夫：他的高興超過了他的年齡，但我只有暗暗可憐他的幼稚和輕浮。</p>
<p>他希望很大，但只是幻夢，他志向很大但本領和技能却低微得可憐。他夢過安樂的天國，名譽，金錢，事業，升官……可是惡毒的現實粉碎了他的甜夢，不能如他之願：但他消夢着，他時常說：以後我得好好的努力，從明天起。但是他從不曾吃過苦，從不曾堅毅地奮鬥過。</p>
<p>他的主要缺點！就是只有幻想，始終踏不着現實‘我們得認淸，在新中國正在誕生的過程中，這種精神將必然地沒落和受淘汰。最可悲的，他並不是單獨的他，他代表了一羣小資產階級的特性和Q阿精神的典型；並且是大多數都市學生嫡親的血統和脈胳，要是能沒有成見肯睜開眼來正視現實的話，他總不會覺得我言之過火的。這應該認爲這是個嚴重問題，是屬於社會的精神病方面，値得學者先生們的注意和討論的。</p>
<p>我們該怎樣來救救這羣靑年呢?</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>我們還年青</h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>我們還年靑。</p>
<p>我們是光，熱，力的結晶。靑春之火正在我們的心田中燃燒！</p>
<p>我們謳歌，謳歌自由和正義。我們更要謳歌眞理，那千古不易的絕對眞理！</p>
<p>我們也抨擊。我們高舉解放的槍，對人閒世的一切醜惡，强暴，無恥…瞄準，在剎那閒宜吿它們的死刑！</p>
<p>我們是宇宙的歌手。也是射擊手。</p>
<p>歷史的進程是曲綫地向上的。偶然的風暴，暫時的黑暗，不能使我們沮喪，頹廢，消</p>
<p>植物在石頭下曲折地生長。我們則是暴風雨中的英勇的海燕！駱駝的耐心，獅子的勇猛，猴子的敏捷！……</p>
<p>不是綿羊的馴服，豺狼的貪殘，蝙蝠的細心！…</p>
<p>為自己，為祖國，也爲人類！</p>
<p>我們還年輕。</p>
<h3>血的舞蹈</h3>
<p>— 丁肚作</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>倪金壽回我們二人說：「松泉此刻在西區警署裹。這消息很簡短，我也不知道詳細的情形。霍先生，你能不能跟我一塊到警廳裏去問一問明白。」</p>
<p>霍桑沉吟了一下才道：「我想回去了。如果有什麽消息，你再通知我。我所關切的，倒是荷生。」</p>
<p>倪金壽點頭道：「好，那末，我先回廳裏去。我一得到荷生的消　，馬上吿訴你。」他紛完了便跳上了近邊的一輛黄包車。</p>
<p>我和霍桑回到愛文路七十七號時，天已漸漸兒黑下來了，馬路上電燈通明。我們一進辦公室的門口，施桂便送上一封信給霍桑。霍桑卸了衣帽，就把信在書桌上的電燈光下展開來。我也湊過去瞧。那是陸健笙送來的，信裹還附着一張一千元的支票，那封信雖祇寥寥幾句，措詞却十分謙恭。</p>
<p>那信道：</p>
<p>「霍先生：麗蘭慘死，弟撫躬自問，負疚良多。辱荷先生負責偵查，感級無已。晨間蒙見詢一切，業已掬誠奉答，區區私衷，至懇垂察。倘得眞兇歸案，爲死者稍雪沉寃，允感大德。附奉薄儀，不腆之至，緩日富再踵門叩謝也。弟陸健笙謹上卽日」霍桑把信箋隨意向書桌面上一丟，脣角上露出一絲輕鄙的微笑。他把身子靠着那隻轉旋的椅子，仲了一個懶腰，却不發表什麼意見。</p>
<p>我笑着說道：「阿根的那筆費用，已用不着你自掏腰包了。」（一六九）</p>

<p>舊話重提</p>
<h3>拿破崙進攻意大利</h3>
<p>— 苦李</p>
<p>音樂的偉大，人所共知，不但陶冶性情，甚至可以治病，頃見「奧斯陸被佔的回憶」一文，不禁想起拿破崙進攻意大利的一番舊話，記得豐子愷譯「孩子們的音樂」一書上，說過一段故事，足見音樂的力量與軍事有甚深之關係。</p>
<p>講起拿破崙，一般人大都只想到他是善於戰爭的，其實並不如此。他在赴戰的時候，常常命令兵士，說那種音樂不行，那種音樂應該大奏。所以拿破崙常自己選軍樂曲；：敵人來攻擊的時候，特地命他的兵士大奏音樂。</p>
<p>西曆千七百九十七年，他正要越阿爾卑斯山的險阻，侵入意大利。而進攻意大利的，據說古來只有二人：其一距今二千年前的亞非利加北海岸的卡爾各塔都會的大將亨尼巴爾；其他一人就是拿破崙。</p>
<p>覆着雪的斷崖絕壁，非一一越過不可。拿破崙部下的隊，本來都是强勇的；但是到了眞的險阻的地方，也不淮行了。看見了道情形的拿破崙，立刻自己選出活潑的音樂，命樂手演奏。兵十聽了道有趣的音樂，就勇氣百倍，終於能越過這險阻的山嶺，而攻進了意大利。</p>

<p>紐的中央醫院裏著名診斷家「格理斯派」是一個跛足醫師，性情暴燥；人都很怕他。祗有一位靑年醫生「吉爾勞一願意和他接近，他也認爲「吉爾勞」是可以做他的「傳人」的。有一次，「吉爾勞」看錯了病，「格理斯派」知道這完全由於經騐不足，因此派「吉爾勞」到貧民醫診所服務，並且派女郞「曼妮」伴同，隨時報告他服務的狀況。他服務得很好。某一天，被人誤傷的「尼克」請他診治，他取出槍彈儘心療治。「尼克」的姊姊「羅莎麗」美豔非常，「吉爾勞」愛上了她。由於「曼妮」的報吿，「格里斯派」知道他替可能犯罪的「尼克」在秘密診治，便勸他不必，並且要立刻送交警捕，否則醫生的職位會被政府取消的，他不答應。後來他被騙回家，待他冉回紐的爲「尼克」診洽以後「尼克」爲警補拘起來，他亦被醫院解職，他相信，尼克不是個犯罪的人，然而找不到正兇，雪不了寃。他從「尼克」口中得知一位流氓與兇事有關，便設法捉住，拘送警捕。「格理斯派」曉得了這個消息，很是愉快；因爲從此「吉爾勞」又可以恢復「舊日生涯」。也知道「吉爾勞」爲「羅沙麗」者述，於是親訪這一位女郞，纔知道她並不愛他，恰巧「吉爾勞」來看她，完全恍然有所悟。離開了「羅沙麗」，重任「格理斯派」的助手，沉湎在同伴女郞「曼妮」的情懷裏，沉湎在神聖的工作裏。</p>
<p>我以爲演得比較更好些的是「里昂巴拉穆亞」的「格理斯派」，那種醫師的神態，多老練，多生動！允其是在表現「性情暴燥易怒」上，高聲的叫喊以及微小的動作都處處「爐火純靑」。「拉娜透納」的「羅沙麗」，「拉琳黛」的「曼妮」都適如其份。反而中演「吉爾勞」的「劉亞理斯」無特殊成就，雖然他並不「失職」！</p>
<p>最最値得我們注意的是導演「Harold，S．Bucquet」的手法，雖然是極小極細末的動作，他從沒有隨便放鬆，他總用過一番心計，我們看了以後，覺到輕快，生動和靈活。我們可以想像到，在導演的時候，「打磕睡」絕不可能。</p>
<h3>「蘭姑娘的悲劇」</h3>
<p>咋天到靑云劇社去看排演「蘭姑娘的悲劇」，成績很好。蘭姑娘一角乃由莊重小姐演飾，據說自從第一篇對辭後她好像是發了癡似的去找參考的材料，揣摩硏究，如今巳快牛年了，她仍是不滿地努力着，的確，她的成功不是偶然得來的，她的演技有兩個優點：（一）呼吸的控制非常自如。（二）表演情緒的分界線很淸楚，允其在第三幕殺了狄克時候發楞的神情，眞入木三分。最後蘭姑娘慘哭了出去，那哭聲簡直就像一把尖刀刺進我的心將我感動得眼淚也流出來。導演姜景君虛心地叫我批評，其實我除了爲業餘劇團的前途慶幸以外還有什麽可說呢？</p>

<h3>Gannady: Strong Supporter of Aiding Britain</h3>
<p>Boston: U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Gannady, met with reporters here yesterday. Having witnessed the British Air Force's victory, he believes aircraft production is the most important defense measure. While supporting continued aid to Britain, he opposes U.S. entry into the war. Gannady expressed pessimism about immediate peace overseas and dismissed rumors of his resignation as unfounded. He plans to vacation in California and Florida and will return to London within 48 hours if needed. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Pacific Joint Defense Issue: Agreement Established Between the U.S., Britain, and Australia; U.S. Navy to Use British and Australian Bases; Possible Blockade Against Japan in the Far East</h3>
<p>London: Reliable sources claimed last night that Britain, the U.S., and Australia have agreed on a Pacific defense agreement to enable immediate emergency action. The core of the agreement concerns defense cooperation in the Pacific and the use of naval bases. However, whether the formidable Singapore naval base is included is unclear. The Pacific joint defense issue has been discussed extensively by U.S. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lothian, Australian Minister Richard, and others, and is now nearing completion. Officials here are silent on the details of the new agreement. However, it is believed to stipulate that Britain, the U.S., and Australia mutually use each other's naval and air bases in the Pacific. This determination for joint action to resist continued aggression is prompted by Japan's signing of a military alliance with the Axis powers. According to the agreement, Britain, the U.S., and Australia, in case of emergency in the Far East, can impose a long-range naval blockade against Japan. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: It is expected that officials will announce details within days regarding the U.S. and Britain forming a common front in the Far East. Details must remain strictly confidential. However, informed sources believe that Singapore and Darwin are within the scope of the common front. The U.S. Navy will control the territorial waters of the Eastern Pacific. It is pointed out here that Britain can deploy a large naval fleet in European waters. Additionally, Britain may obtain multiple U.S. destroyers. It is now openly acknowledged that U.S.-British negotiations have been underway for several weeks. Therefore, Roosevelt's and Gannady's assurances that there are no secret agreements between the U.S. and Britain have now been proven to be electioneering tactics. Furthermore, the U.S. is simultaneously negotiating with Mexico to discuss U.S. use of Mexican naval and air bases. It is also learned that the oil issue between the U.S. and Mexico will also be discussed in these negotiations. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>British and American Officials Remain Tight-Lipped</p>
<p>London: Regarding reports today that Britain, the U.S., and Australia have reached a general agreement on Pacific cooperation, officials here have no information. It is claimed that some time ago, officials from the U.S. State Department, the Australian Minister, and the British Ambassador exchanged opinions, but this exchange was entirely informal and only for mutual clarification. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department last night denied reports from London that the U.S., Britain, and Australia have established an agreement on joint Pacific defense. A State Department spokesperson pointed out that diplomatic representatives from Britain and Australia had discussed the Pacific situation with Secretary of State Hull. However, according to the spokesperson, Secretary of State Hull refused to discuss details with them at the time. Hull has repeatedly told reporters that the U.S. has never made any commitments to British or Australian diplomatic representatives. However, there is widespread criticism here regarding rumors that the U.S. has already established an agreement with Britain and Australia in the Pacific, believing that such an agreement may already be in place. It is generally believed that this agreement includes the U.S. Navy borrowing British and Australian bases in the Far East, so that if Britain and the U.S. are attacked in the Pacific, the three countries can take joint action. (Taiwan Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Anti-Aggression Policy Remains Consistent; U.S. Attitude Toward Japan to Become More Assertive</p>
<p>Washington: The world is delighted by President Roosevelt's re-election, except for the three Axis powers. This demonstrates that the Axis powers acknowledge that their acts of aggression cannot gain the sympathy of the four hemispheres. Even if the election results were different, such sympathy would not be forthcoming. However, if Wilkie had been elected, the Axis powers in Europe and Asia would have exploited the period of temporary pause in administrative handover between the current and new administrations in January to advance their schemes. Now that Roosevelt has been re-elected, the firmness displayed by U.S. policy in recent months will continue uninterrupted. It appears that Secretary of State Hull will remain in office. His views on aggression and the new order in Europe and Asia have been thoroughly expressed during the election campaign. The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Suma, said that U.S. policy toward Japan should be revised. People here, regardless of party affiliation, believe this to be the case. However, the revisions to U.S. policy toward Japan should not be in the direction indicated by the Tokyo spokesperson. If Japan takes new aggressive actions, U.S. policy may be revised in another direction. Suma claims that U.S. policy is unfriendly to Japan. Observers here ask when Japanese policy has ever been friendly to U.S. interests since Japan began pursuing its national policy with weapons in 1921. People here are still closely monitoring Japan's withdrawal from Southern China to determine its underlying meaning. Some commentators suggest that the Japanese military will redeploy to the Dutch East Indies. However, those with a more moderate view believe that Japan cannot currently undertake such a large-scale risky operation because what Japan has bitten off in China is more than it can chew. It must now spit out some to avoid suffering from long-term lockjaw in China. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Returns to the White House; Convenes Important Meetings; Discusses Steps to Intensify Aid to China and Britain</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt returned victoriously here yesterday from his Hyde Park estate and immediately began discussions with the National Defense Committee. The President's discussions with the National Defense Committee lasted two hours and fifteen minutes. It is believed that this meeting has historical value, as the U.S. may immediately intensify aid to Britain. It is also believed that the proposal to ship 12,000 American aircraft to Britain may be put forward for commencement. After the meeting concluded, the President immediately convened a high-level meeting to decide what kind of military equipment could be sold without hindering the U.S.'s own self-defense procedures. It is believed that this committee is considering the President's proposal to ship 12,000 American military aircraft. Observers believe that President Roosevelt's first official announcement upon returning to Washington will be to accelerate the supply of military equipment to Britain. Some sources believe that the President is also determined to take similar action to increase aid to China. President Roosevelt, accompanied by Mrs. Roosevelt, returned to Washington yesterday, beaming with happiness because he had achieved an honor never before seen in American history. He told reporters, "Although we have returned here later than expected, we are very happy. You should know that we love rural life very much, but as far as cities are concerned, we love living in Washington more than any other city." (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: Just hours after President Roosevelt returned to the U.S. capital yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Gannady, and Secretary of State Hull visited him. It is rumored that the British purchasing delegation in the U.S. is currently meeting with the U.S. President, raising speculation that the President is now formally considering continuing aid to Britain. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>New U.S. Government to Take Office in January; Secretary of State Hull Expected to Remain; Interior Secretary Ickes Announces Resignation</h3>
<p>Washington: The new U.S. government will take office in January. Rumors about the new government's composition are circulating here. Interior Secretary Ickes announced his resignation last night, and it is expected that other cabinet members will follow in Ickes' footsteps within the year. General attention is now focused on the State Department. When asked about his future, Secretary of State Hull responded very cautiously. However, it is believed that President Roosevelt will certainly retain him. It is known that Hull is eager to step down and may use old age as an excuse to retire. However, just months ago, Hull stated that in times of crisis, he was willing to make any necessary sacrifices for the national interest. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Hull may remain in office to ensure the consistency of U.S. policy. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes, who has served since March 4, 1933, announced last night that he has resigned so that President Roosevelt will have the freedom to allocate cabinet positions if he needs to change cabinet members. This is the only reason for his resignation. As for Mr. Roosevelt's re-election, he is very pleased. Ickes is 66 years old and has been practicing law. He was initially a staff member of a Chicago newspaper and has been dedicated to municipal reform politics since the age of 23. During the First European War, he went to France with the 35th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces to work for the YMCA. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Wilkie to Broadcast on Monday</h3>
<p>Washington: News from last night indicates that President Roosevelt will deliver two radio addresses on Armistice Day on Monday. The first is scheduled for 11:00 AM, and the second for 3:30 PM. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>New York: The defeated Republican presidential candidate, Wilkie, announced last night that he will deliver a several-hour address to the nation next Monday night to articulate the policies that he and his countless followers will implement during President Roosevelt's third term. The address is scheduled for 11:30 PM (i.e., 11:30 AM on Tuesday in Shanghai). (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Chairman of the U.S. Republican Committee, Martin, issued a statement yesterday, stating briefly that the Republican Party is prepared to support Roosevelt, but on the condition that it does not betray the various principles issued during the Republican campaign. The Republican Party recognizes Wilkie's leadership and is not influenced by conservatives such as Hoover and Landon. Martin hopes that the Republican Party will gain a leading position in the 1941 congressional elections. (Haitong, 8th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>This Year's Winter Relief</h3>
<p>As time passes, the north wind gradually strengthens. There was a period of high pressure that once arrived, and many have already frozen to death. Fortunately, it is still deep autumn, which has turned mild again. However, the weather yesterday was a glimpse of early winter. Recalling last year's several cold spells, reports of deaths from extreme cold on the roadside were endless. Subsequently, the Charity Federation came forward to organize emergency relief, distributing bread daily at dusk to provide heat from the food to ward off the external cold. During the distribution, one saw the old supporting the young, and countless heads jostling. It is conceivable that the number of people awaiting relief and the effectiveness of the effort ensured that quite a few survived. This year's high prices and the general difficulty of life are certainly incomparable to last year. As a result, the number of displaced people on the streets and their miserable plight are even worse than before. And when one thinks of the expression, "Sitting in the sun on a sunny eave, warmth filling the robe," one the joy, the other the anxiety of being in the same harsh winter, the difference between joy and sorrow could not be more different. Therefore, if we must wait for a certain number of people to starve and freeze to death before thinking about relief, is this the intention of a benevolent person? Can they not worry and be concerned in advance?</p>
<p>Relief is a beautiful name, but it is often difficult to maintain consistently. Everyone has a heart of compassion, but they cannot see it in action. If one must wait for the name to be verified before being willing to make the effort for relief, then one will be searching for dried fish in the market. Therefore, those with good intentions should simply make good wishes. Good deeds should certainly be selective, but good names need not be for oneself. As for those who doubt that good deeds cannot be fully realized, keep their purses tightly closed, have no heart for compassion, and forget their duty to help each other in the community, this is not what the human heart should do. Therefore, in the past, there was "breaking money for merit," only seeking one's own charity, not caring about the reality of the situation. However, those who handle charitable deeds should do their best to live up to the wishes of the donors and ensure that "funds are not wasted and that things are practical." Be careful not to use the name of good to achieve evil, and do not use improper personnel and accumulate corruption. It is difficult to raise donations, and it is difficult to organize relief. Those with some experience in relief work all share this feeling.</p>
<p>Speaking of winter relief, it is emergency relief. Since it is called emergency relief, it should address what is urgent. If one must wait until the matter is at hand to launch it, then there will be people who freeze to death, and there will be people who starve to death. Historically, winter relief has included shelters to provide food and clothing, treat illnesses, and break addictions, so that displaced people have a place to stay and are free from the danger of wind and snow. This is a good deed. But it requires a lot of money, first. It is not easy to find a vacant place in the isolated city to set up a factory for accommodation, second. It must be organized and led by a group, third. And often limited by the number of places and funding, there is a feeling of admitting a few is better than admitting none, fourth. In addition, there is the distribution of clothing and rice tickets. Clothing tickets can be used to get clothes to keep warm, but when there is no food, the beard prefers to endure the cold rather than the hunger and pawns the clothing. This shows that food is very important. Therefore, there is the distribution of rice tickets. However, even if the very poor have rice tickets, they still have nothing to cook with, and they cannot eat it raw. Therefore, there is cooked relief. Cooked relief is difficult to organize. First, order is not easy to maintain. Second, the porridge must be thick enough to stand chopsticks in. Third, the porridge must be cooked before dawn and wait to be distributed. Unless the person in charge has enthusiasm and perseverance, it is often difficult to achieve success. It is not easy to find people to distribute porridge, and it is also difficult to find places to distribute porridge. Therefore, the Charity Federation distributed bread last year and first added ginger soup, because bread cannot ward off the cold like hot porridge, and it can be slightly adjusted with hot soup. In addition, it is better to distribute porridge tickets and meal tickets than to distribute rice tickets. Porridge tickets have long been issued by the Chinese Life-Saving Association, designating several porridge shops to provide porridge upon presentation of the ticket. However, meal tickets have not yet been organized. Even if there are organizers, they sell plain rice at a flat price. It is advisable to imitate the porridge tickets and designate several restaurants to issue rice upon presentation of the ticket and collect the rice money from the ticket-issuing organization. The advantage of porridge and meal tickets is that everyone issues them according to their own wishes, according to the thickness of their power, and purchases porridge and meal tickets from charitable organizations that issue tickets and distributes them to the poor. This is the so-called using the power of the people to relieve the people, which is more universal and thorough than relying solely on the power of charitable organizations. In view of the severity of this year's living pressure and the large number of poor people suffering from hunger and cold, we sincerely hope that benevolent people will prepare for relief early, without waiting for the height of winter, when hunger and cold lead to successive deaths on the road, before speaking of relief.</p>

(Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces Gain Advantage in Northern Henan Battle</h3>

<h3>Nanning: Reasons for Japanese Troop Withdrawal: Attempt to Conserve Troops, Unable to Sustain Economic Strain, Bai Chongxi's Report During Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Bai Chongxi gave a report at the Central Memorial Week this Monday: (Why the Japanese withdrew from Nanning). He said, "Everyone has paid close attention to the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning over the past week. Based on my personal observation, I will give a simple report. Of course, there are reasons for the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning. According to Japanese newspaper propaganda, Nanning has lost its military importance and there is no need to occupy it for a long time. Although this is a lie, based on our objective observation, the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning shows their weakness, because they do not have enough troops and are trying to conserve troops and redeploy troops. The maximum number of troops that the Japanese can mobilize is seventy-five to eighty divisions. Since the start of the war, the most troops the Japanese have used in China reached forty-two divisions. If we include the nine Japanese divisions in the Northeast, then the Japanese have mobilized fifty-two divisions, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of troops they can mobilize. Under this large mobilization number, the number of Japanese troop losses is even more alarming. According to the Japanese Army Ministry's own announcement, over the past three years, they have lost over one million officers and soldiers, a quarter of whom are dead and three-quarters of whom are wounded. If we examine the Japanese mobilization figures and their casualties, we can see that their total military spending has reached 270 billion yen, a figure that exceeds the military expenditure of the Russo-Japanese War by tenfold. From this, we can know the seriousness of the Japanese economic crisis. (8th)</p>
<h3>Yu Youren and Others Initiate the Confucian Society</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the English-language Chutian Daily, prominent figures in the National Government, including Kong Xiangxi, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, and Chen Lifu, have recently initiated the organization of the "Confucian Society," which will be formally established in the capital in the near future. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Hong Kong Not Withdrawing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to semi-official Japanese sources, reports that Japanese residents in Hong Kong are currently rapidly withdrawing are inaccurate. As of the 5th of this month, there were a total of 5,755 Japanese residents in Hong Kong, which is two more than before July. Furthermore, there are currently 258 Japanese women and children remaining in Hong Kong. According to Washington reports from November 5, the US authorities are currently monitoring the withdrawal of Japanese residents in Hong Kong, considering this to be a harbinger of new military actions by Japan in southern China. The Japanese Consulate General in Hong Kong denied ordering Japanese residents to withdraw or requesting them to leave Hong Kong. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Henan Military Shoe Conscription Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The military shoe conscription in Henan Province has achieved outstanding results.

The government will provide fertilizer for barren land and various commercial and transportation organizations have also prepared to participate in cooperation. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Vigorous Morale of Greek Troops; Italian Main Attack Repulsed; Slight Retreat of Greek Troops on Coastal Front; Intense Fighting in Epirus</h3>
<p>Athens, According to the Greek military communique released yesterday, local attacks by Italian forces on the Epirus front were all repelled. There was artillery activity on both sides along the entire front. Reports of a slight retreat by the Greek troops yesterday were purely local in nature; the overall situation remains satisfactory. Greek troops continue to capture military supplies in the central area where Italian troops are surrounded. The Greek troops' high morale for offensive and counter-offensive operations remains the same as at the beginning of the war. A Greek bomber was shot down by anti-aircraft fire at the front. On the evening of November 5th, Greek infantry and engineers carried out a courageous action, completely destroying nine enemy tanks that had been damaged by heavy artillery and direct fire two days earlier on the Epirus front. Yesterday's Italian air raids were limited to several small villages near the Albanian border, killing many sheep. Greek reservists of the 1929 class have been ordered to report, including over a hundred officers who were dismissed in 1935 for participating in a coup; they have now been reinstated. Patients with lung diseases at a certain Greek sanatorium wrote to the Greek Commander-in-Chief, Metaxas, volunteering to organize a suicide squad to make any sacrifice, because they feel they are not far from death anyway. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens, According to reliable sources in military circles with access to timely information, early this morning, Greece rushed its elite guard forces to the southern Epirus war front, as Italian invading forces on the Greek-Albanian front are attacking the Metaxas Line with all their mechanized units. The first large-scale all-out offensive by Fascist troops met with fierce resistance from Greek defense forces. A strategically important road in Albania is currently under large-scale Greek bombing. Tirana, the capital of Albania and the Italian military headquarters, is also under heavy bombardment. At the same time, major battles are now unfolding on two main fronts. One is in the western Epirus region, where Italian forces are sending large troops to attack Ioannina. The other is in the central Epirus region, where Greek forces within Albania are intensifying their attack on the Italian base in Korçë. (International Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>London, According to informed circles here, Greek troops have made slight progress in the Slinnitsa area. As far as is known, Korçë is still in our hands. Along the more southerly coast, it is reported that Greek troops have retreated to the Acheron River, and the Italian forces are reportedly pressing hard. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome, The Italian military headquarters announced that fierce fighting is taking place on the Epirus front. Italian aircraft bombed roads near Lake Prespa and the Kofu Fortress, hitting several bombs. All Italian aircraft returned safely. Six British aircraft attacked Vlorë, four were shot down, and the remaining two are likely to have crashed as well. Several British pilots parachuted, and two were captured. In North Africa, Italian aircraft launched a fierce attack on the Sidi Barrani airfield, strafing at low altitude, causing heavy losses to the British forces. Two aircraft in the field were set on fire by bombs. British aircraft dropped three bombs on the Brindisi station between 3:00 AM and 4:30 AM this morning, and two incendiary bombs near the station. The railway, water pipes, and a freight car were destroyed by the bombs. A nearby civilian house was also set on fire by the bombing but was quickly extinguished, with no casualties. (Naval Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome, According to a military correspondent for "Il Popolo d'Italia," Greek fortresses are similar to the "Maginot Line" and are built with materials from Britain and France, but Italian tanks, artillery, and machine guns can immediately break through stubborn resistance. Greek troops lack food and weapons.</p>
<p>Sofia, According to Athens radio broadcasts received here, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas declared yesterday that Greece will continue to fight until final victory. Metaxas said, "The methods used by Italy only serve to encourage our people to fight bravely until final victory." (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Fierce Battles for Important Highways</p>
<p>Ohrid, The battles between Italian and Greek forces for two important highways became even more intense yesterday. Italian forces attacked the road to Kalpaki and the road from Albania to Ioannina yesterday but were repelled by Greek forces. It is reported that the Greek offensive on the Korçë to Bilisht highway has now weakened. The battle of Ioannina is taking place in the village of Vissani, 23 kilometers from the town. Fifty Italian soldiers, two officers, and two trucks were captured. Three Greek aircraft bombed the Italian base in Argyrokastro yesterday morning. The battle for the Korçë highway is concentrated on the northeast flank of Mount Morova, which overlooks a mountain pass through which the highway passes. On the other side of the pass is Mount Suha. The Greek Third Army is fighting to the death to break through the pass and advance towards the Italian forces on the highway from Kamenica to Korçë, which are now under concentrated artillery fire from the Greek forces. At the same time, the Greek artillery is also bombarding the heavily fortified positions around Mount Morova and Mount Suha. The sound of artillery fire can be heard clearly here. It is also reported that seven Italian troop transports, fully loaded with new troops, arrived at the port of Sarandë in Albania on Wednesday night. These new troops are believed to be going to reinforce the Korçë area. (United Press International, 8th)</p>
<p>Bitola, Yugoslavia, The heaviest artillery fire since the beginning of the war was heard from the Korçë area yesterday afternoon, rumbling here. Greek troops are attacking the Italian forces along the eastern foothills of Mount Morova. According to reports from the west bank of Lake Prespa (Albanian border), the artillery battle began at 2:00 PM and lasted for several hours, with the Greek forces gaining the upper hand. There is also fighting on the south bank of Lake Prespa. The Greek village of German, five kilometers east of the lake, has been completely destroyed by Italian aircraft. The fighting along the lake indicates that Italian forces are attempting to cross the lake and directly attack Greek territory on the other side. At the same time, Italian aircraft launched a large-scale bombing of Florina yesterday morning, and the people of the town have fled. (United Press International, 8th)</p>
<p>Italian Artillery Column Ambushed in Greek Mountains</p>
<p>Athens, Last night, the Greek High Command stated that Greek soldiers set up an ambush and completely annihilated an Italian artillery column that was passing through the Pindus Mountains to reinforce Ioannina, capturing over fifty mountain guns. After this recent great achievement by the brave Greek defense forces, the Greek forces that penetrated deep into Albania also occupied the hills overlooking the Korçë area. As a result, Korçë and 26 neighboring villages are all under Greek control. Italian forces plan to break through the highway to Ioannina, the Greek transportation hub, and strike at the Greek forces along the Ionian coast. However, reports indicate that the Greek forces on the Epirus front are placing them in a difficult situation. The Italian offensive seems to be gradually expanding, becoming the first major offensive since the start of the war. It is also reported that the vanguard of the Greek troops in skirts has advanced twelve miles north of Korçë and has begun to attack the rear of the defense forces in the area. There is also increased air activity around the city. (International Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Bomb Italian Air Force Base</p>
<p>Cairo, According to the British official report released here today, the bomber squadron under the British forces in the Near East attacked the real center point of the Italian invasion of Greece early yesterday morning, causing a major fire and turning the important Italian naval base of Brindisi into ruins. In addition, the mechanized unit of the Indian Army, supplemented by the British Air Force stationed in Sudan, has captured Gallabat, an important town on the Abyssinian border. This is the second major blow suffered by the Italian forces yesterday. Braving the raging anti-aircraft fire, British aircraft began to bomb Brindisi from late Wednesday night until yesterday morning. Hundreds of tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped by British aircraft like rain, falling on naval shipyards, submarine bases, railway stations, and Italian military barracks. The sky over the entire area of this large port in the Adriatic Sea, between the various shipyards and railway yards, was filled with British bombers, and the number of fires was countless. It is believed that thousands of Italian soldiers concentrated in Brindisi, waiting for trains to the Albanian border, were all buried in this battle. (International News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>London, A Reuters air force correspondent stated that British fighter planes have now begun to assist the Greek Air Force in protecting Greek cities and towns from Italian air raids. British aircraft patrolled Greek airspace on Wednesday and did not encounter Italian aircraft. On Tuesday, British aircraft assisted the Greek defense forces in repelling an Italian attack on Piraeus and shot down an Italian aircraft. The Italian city of Brindisi was raided by British aircraft on Tuesday night. The city is a major seaport for the Italian forces in Albania to receive supplies and reinforcements, and its importance is comparable to that of Bari. At the same time, the Central Air Force also conducted extensive reconnaissance in various Italian ports and along the coast. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome, An Italian military communiqué acknowledged that British aircraft had raided Brindisi and destroyed the military station there. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London, According to an official communiqué released here, a squadron of British bombers in Greece raided the Italian airfield in Vlorë on Wednesday, with great success. British aircraft dropped bombs on Italian aircraft parked on the ground and strafed with machine guns. A large number of Italian air force personnel stationed at the field were also attacked. Italian fighter planes took off to intercept, but without effect. All British aircraft returned to base safely. The leader of the British aircraft, upon returning, told people that our attack was completely unexpected by the enemy, so we were able to drop bombs smoothly and without hindrance. Our observers saw the bombs we dropped explode among the enemy aircraft parked on the ground, inflicting heavy damage. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Italian Aircraft Intensify Activities to Hinder Greek Offensive</p>
<p>Rome, According to a report released here, the superiority of the Italian Air Force is the most important factor in the war on the Greek front. Greek attempts to launch offensives in the Florina area, the Lake Prespa area, and the Capeshti Pass were all hindered by the swift action of the Italian Air Force. After the Italian military learned that the Greek military intended to attack in the Lake Prespa area, they immediately sent aircraft to attack Greek military positions and troop concentrations in the area, preventing the Greek offensive from materializing. Greek air defense equipment is incomplete, lacking anti-aircraft guns, so the machine guns used are very ineffective. In the Florina area, Italian aircraft attacked stations, railways, and highways, cutting off transportation. It is said that on the Kalamas front, due to recent heavy rains, the river has flooded, and the roads are muddy. Italian engineers are very busy preparing the roadbed so that artillery and ammunition can advance. (Haitong Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Greek Officials Deny Entry of British Troops Before the War</p>
<p>Athens, Greek officials issued a formal denial today regarding the Italian radio broadcast that British troops had arrived in Crete before the war, stating that it is known to the world that, due to Greece's neutrality, there were no British soldiers or aircraft within its territory before the war. The British fleet only arrived in Crete several days after the start of the war. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Southern Ireland Firmly Refuses; Britain to Lease Ports; De Valera Reaffirms Neutrality Policy; Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Laments for Britain</h3>
<p>Dublin, The proposal to lease Irish Free State seaports to Britain for use was flatly rejected yesterday by Irish Prime Minister de Valera. De Valera also warned Britain that if Britain attempts to obtain it through pressure, it will "only lead to bloodshed." This Irish leader, born in New York, stated in a fiery speech in Parliament that Ireland is determined and prepared to protect its neutrality or independence, resorting to force if necessary. De Valera's speech was clearly a response to British Prime Minister Churchill's speech on Tuesday. De Valera also warned the people, "The crisis is coming." (Note: Churchill admitted during his speech that the German submarine warfare was indeed a more serious problem than the German air raids. Churchill also believed that the high number of British merchant ships lost to German submarines was due to the Anglo-Irish Treaty before the war. Government officials explained that this meant that the victory of the German submarine warfare was largely due to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which prevented Britain from using key Irish ports as naval bases. During the last World War, Britain used Queenstown as a naval base, and since then, the place has been renamed Cobh.) De Valera denied in his speech yesterday that German submarines had ever used Ireland as a place to refuel. De Valera stated, "Any belligerent country, including Britain, that attempts to exert pressure on us will only cause bloodshed. The government will defend our rights as long as it is in office. While Ireland maintains its neutrality, our key ports cannot be leased or transferred." (International Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>London, Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Craigavon expressed regret last night regarding Southern Ireland's Prime Minister de Valera's declaration that he would not grant Britain the convenience of Southern Irish ports. It is said that we deeply regret the attitude of the Southern Irish government, but those who have studied every stage of the Southern Irish policy are not surprised by this. Because Southern Ireland has always received concessions from Britain, but has never intended to repay them. At a time when the British Empire is fighting for its survival, the Southern Irish government is declaring neutrality towards the country that it relies on for its preservation, making it more difficult. In summary, de Valera's announcement is the culmination of a development that Northern Ireland has long anticipated. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Revolution Anniversary, Grand Parade in Red Square, National Defense Commissar Encourages National Unity, Red Army Fully Prepared to Repel the Enemy</h3>
<p>Moscow: Yesterday marked the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, celebrated enthusiastically by the entire nation. Streets were packed with people, and workers, employees, cultural figures, and students held solemn gatherings in their factories and schools. At ten o'clock, crowds streamed into Red Square to watch the military parade. Red Square was filled with people, including members of the Supreme Soviet, members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Soviet heroes, Red Army soldiers, scientists, representatives from Lithuania and Estonia, and members of the diplomatic corps. Foreign journalists and the diplomatic corps occupied special seating. The troops participating in the parade were in impressive array. At eleven o'clock, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Kalinin entered the square one after another, greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. Simultaneously, People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Timoshenko rode into the square, and the entire square erupted in thunderous applause. After listening to the report from General Turunaev, the parade commander, Marshal Timoshenko began the inspection. He then ascended the platform to deliver a speech, congratulating the workers, peasants, Soviets, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians on the October Revolution on behalf of the Party and the government. When Marshal Timoshenko finished his speech and toasted Stalin's longevity, the entire square cheered for several minutes. At this time, the band played the Internationale, and artillery fired a salute.</p>
<p>The troops then began to advance, first the students of the Frunze Military Academy, followed by the students of the Lenin Military Political Academy and personnel from the Stalin Motor and Mechanical Academy. Their impressive appearance demonstrated their effective training. In addition, the Civil Aviation Corps, led by the Dean of the Civil Aviation Academy, also participated in the parade, including several female pilots. When the Baltic Fleet personnel passed the reviewing stand, the entire square stood up and cheered. Noteworthy was the new war weapon, manufactured by students from specialized schools, who will become excellent artillerymen in the Red Army. A team of armed Moscow laborers also participated in the parade, including veteran soldiers of advanced age and new soldiers about to join the Red Army. Furthermore, cavalry galloped across the square in an orderly fashion. The armored vehicles, tanks, and new artillery participating in the parade made a profound impression.</p>
<p>The parade lasted for an hour and a half, showcasing the great and impressive strength of the Red Army. During the military parade, various Soviet aircraft also flew over Red Square. Soviet pilots performed various amazing feats with their latest high-speed aircraft, leaving people speechless. There had been demonstrations in Moscow before, but none had been on such a large scale or with such broad sentiment. As the crowds entered Red Square, they cheered towards Stalin and Molotov. They marched shoulder to shoulder with other demonstrators, including countless enthusiastic young men, all of whom practiced parachute jumping and driving skills in addition to their daily work. This demonstration showed the Soviet people's determination to strengthen discipline and national defense. There were thousands of slogans in Red Square, all unanimously supporting Stalin and the Soviet government's wise diplomatic policy, which aims to consolidate peace and ensure the security of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the representatives of the new republics were extremely popular yesterday, demonstrating the strong spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people and their loyalty to the great leader Stalin, the Soviet government, and the Communist Party.

<p>Full Text of the National Defense Commissar's Speech</p>
<p>Moscow: During the military parade, National Defense Commissar Marshal Timoshenko delivered a speech, stating, "Comrades of the Red Army, representatives of workers and peasants, and Soviet Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian comrades, on behalf of the Soviet Communist Party Executive Committee and the Soviet government, I congratulate you on the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution. Years of construction work by the Soviet people have passed, which will be a victory of the socialist era in the history of the October Revolution. This victory was achieved under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the wise guidance of the great Stalin. With strong confidence, the Soviet people have implemented the great Third Five-Year Plan. We have achieved great achievements in the economy. Our socialist industry and agriculture are developing. The production of military equipment, machinery, oil, other daily necessities, and agricultural products has also increased. Labor discipline has been strengthened. Genuine Bolshevik orders have been implemented in factories and collective farms. The Stakhanovite movement is also expanding. In short, our country has multiplied its defense and economic strength. We celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution at a time of extremely complex international circumstances. The war is expanding, and half of the world's population is currently affected. The war is extremely brutal, and millions of lives have been lost. Cultural and material losses are immeasurable. The wise Stalinist diplomatic policy (a policy of peace and security to guarantee national security) has achieved significant victories. The Soviet Union has not participated in the war. The Soviet government is committed to safeguarding the people's peaceful work. The Soviet Union's international position has also improved. Based on the strength of the Red Army, the Soviet Union has adopted peaceful methods to resolve the Soviet-Romanian disputes regarding Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. At the same time, the hated landlord and capitalist regime of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia has been destroyed. The people have regained their freedom and have been forever freed from hunger and poverty. They now enjoy a happy life. Under the radiant light of Stalin, the industry and agriculture of these states will continue to develop forever. To safeguard border security and national interests, the Soviet Union's borders have expanded to the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic Sea, and the Danube River. Capitalist countries have been forced to concede. All of these achievements have strengthened our country's national defense. However, we cannot be complacent about various achievements. We must be extra vigilant. Comrade Stalin once said, "We must always keep the entire nation mobilized and ready to respond to foreign attacks, so that the enemy's "accidents" and various tricks cannot be implemented." We must keep this instruction in mind. We must also strengthen the Red Army and the Navy in all aspects, further enhance our country's national defense and economic strength. The working masses of our country must also work harder, strengthen their discipline, and increase productivity. Their work will make the country even stronger. On the other hand, the Red Army is indeed the only guarantee of the working masses' peaceful work and the great achievements of the October Revolution, and is ready to fulfill its sacred mission at any time. Under the orders of the government and the Communist Party, the Red Army will defeat any enemy who dares to invade the sacred borders of the socialist state." (TASS dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>US Treasury Department Plans to Recommend Increasing Public Debt to Cover Defense Expenditures</h3>
<p>Washington: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that the Treasury Department will ask Congress to increase the statutory public debt limit by $150 billion to cover defense program expenses. If so, the Treasury Department will be able to support the 1942 fiscal year. When reporters asked if this increase would be sufficient for the next four years, the Treasury Secretary replied that it would not, because the United States is only just beginning to rearm. The Treasury Department will recommend to Congress that future government bond issuances also be taxed. He hopes that Congress can make central and local government bonds uniformly taxable, but this only refers to future issuances. The increase in public debt may coincide with an increase in taxes, but he does not believe that there is a possibility of establishing a tax base everywhere. Now that the defense program has been fully implemented, the problem of rising prices and possible inflation will arise, but he does not worry about inflation. After Morgenthau made this statement, the market situation was confirmed to be very strong. Wall Street insiders believe that this statement contains inflationary implications.

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Mrs. President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>If Americans believe in fortune-telling, then Mrs. President Roosevelt must truly have the "luck of helping her husband." If you don't believe it, look at how she campaigned politically for her husband and how she organized various groups, enabling her husband to be re-elected president for three terms. We often say that a talented wife is a good helper, but this Mrs. Roosevelt can be called a "good helper both inside and outside."</p>
<p>Robert Blake, biographer of Mrs. President Roosevelt, "Eleanor Roosevelt," said: "If Republican candidate Willkie wants to be elected President of the United States, he has to defeat not just one Roosevelt, but two. Although President Roosevelt does not actually participate in the election campaign, that second Roosevelt is also very formidable."</p>
<p>Who is the second Roosevelt? It is undoubtedly Mrs. President Roosevelt. Her maiden name was also Roosevelt, and she married a husband who was also a Roosevelt. As a result, the nieces and nephews of the couple are all Roosevelts, which often confuses people. Willkie could not defeat the male Roosevelt, but he actually suffered quite a few losses at the hands of the female Roosevelt. The Roosevelt couple work together, and now they are securely in their third term as masters of the White House.</p>
<p>Mrs. President Roosevelt openly participating in the presidential election for her husband is very rare in history. In fact, this is just her surface work. Secretly, she had already completed many tasks quietly during normal times. Democratic Party veteran propaganda director Michelson has always disliked women in politics, but he has a different view of Mrs. Roosevelt, praising her as the greatest female politician in the world. Former Chairman Farley of the Democratic National Convention said that Mrs. Roosevelt is one of the top political figures, whether male or female.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt's "formidable" nature can be analyzed into the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Her character: Eleanor Roosevelt can be said to be the most prestigious woman in the United States. She hosts the "My Day" column in the newspaper, writing articles every day. Although they have no political meaning, they are extremely influential. Millions of readers take her words and deeds as their model. From 1933 to 1934, those who called her "formidable" have now changed their attitude and have great respect for her.</p>
<p>(2) Her leadership position in the women's community: Not only during the election, she is the leader of the women's community, but also on weekdays, she does various preparatory work, and has always been a leader among women. Before her husband served as Governor of New York, she traveled around giving speeches, making women interested in their policies. As a result of her efforts, the Democratic Women's Department has become a politically powerful organization.</p>
<p>(3) She is a friend to young people: Among all the leaders in the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt spends the most time and energy thoroughly studying youth issues. She often extends rational sympathy to various youth movements, enabling President Roosevelt and the nation's youth to understand each other without any barriers. In this election, many young people of voting age supported Roosevelt, which was largely due to his wife's daily activities.</p>
<p>(4) Her political strategy: In every Democratic Party campaign over the years, there has not been one without her planning the overall strategy.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever there is an election, in addition to giving speeches everywhere herself, she also goes all out to encourage and comfort party members, raise funds, and study local conditions, becoming a pillar of the Democratic Party. As for her speaking ability, she can be said to be one of the best in the United States. After the launch of this election campaign, the Democratic Party representatives lobbied everywhere, and they all felt tired and bored. Because it was like this in the first election, like this in the second election, and now it was going to be like this in the third election. Everyone was almost unable to support it. So they all hoped that President Roosevelt could personally take the stage and give a shot in the arm, but the old man shook his feather fan leisurely and was slow to get started. Once, when Wallace was giving a speech, the audience suddenly became restless, and the audience responded to the speaker with hisses of contempt. Several representatives looked at each other, and no one could come up with an idea. At that time, Mrs. President Roosevelt was also in the audience, and someone suggested that Mrs. Roosevelt be invited to give a speech. Mrs. Roosevelt took the lead and went on stage at this critical moment. Strangely enough, she used just a few simple words to capture the hearts of the audience. In just a few minutes, everyone listened with sincerity, and there was not a sound in the audience. Of course, the reporters present all said that it was rare for the audience to be so moved by the speech.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt is also a champion in organizing women's groups and guiding women's movements in various places. Democratic women have established pro-Roosevelt President associations of all sizes in various places, and the momentum is so great that Willkie is at a loss.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt participated in political activities in 1922 for the sake of her husband and family. Until now, she still does not give up her political career for these two reasons. Her basic concept is that the town, the city, the state, and the country are all derived from the family and are just a reduced form of the family. If a woman is not interested in the government, then it is difficult to expect her to fulfill her responsibilities fully in the family. She instilled this idea everywhere in the minds of women. Regardless of wealth or poverty, she always used this theory to move them, calling on American women to come into contact with politics.</p>
<p>While Roosevelt was Governor of New York, his wife often went out with him on inspections. Later, Roosevelt became paralyzed and had difficulty walking. All inspections, prisons, schools, and other matters that required the governor to go were handled by Mrs. Roosevelt. At first, she couldn't get used to it and found it extremely annoying, but later she enjoyed it. Now she often says: "This is the best education I have ever received." After 1933, she became her husband's unofficial inspector, and all the affairs handled by the federal government were within her scope of inspection.</p>
<p>Everything she learns, she always imparts to others. Therefore, American women generally understand and recognize the relationship between the government, the government and the family, with children, and with their husbands' businesses more clearly than women in other countries. All of this must be attributed to Mrs. Roosevelt's instillation.</p>
<p>Regarding this election, she had a famous saying: "This matter concerns national safety. Every voter should clearly recognize "under which person, which party, can the country obtain the greatest safety" before the election. These words are truly said very thoroughly, no wonder everyone wants to follow her."</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt likes to correspond with the general public in person, so that the public and the president have a good feeling. On the one hand, she conveys the desires of the people and the appeals of the lower classes, so that the president in the high halls and remote mansions can also thoroughly understand them, so that there is no danger of estrangement.</p>
<p>After Roosevelt recovered from paralysis, his mother asked him to move from the White House to his hometown of Hyde Park for quiet recuperation. This was a mother's love, and her affection was so sincere and meticulous. Mrs. Roosevelt believed that if Roosevelt could resume political life, his physical recovery would be faster. From then on, there were inevitable differences of opinion between the women. Roosevelt then asked his husband's personal physician, Dr. Treber, about this issue. Treber replied: "Does he still want to live, or die spiritually? If he wants life, then he can live on. All living people will feel tired, and the injury I suffer from fatigue will never exceed the fatigue caused by the injury." As a result, Mrs. Roosevelt won.</p>
<p>Mrs. President Roosevelt is energetic and clear-headed. She doesn't know how many things she does in a day, seeing guests, attending meetings, writing, busy non-stop. She herself said? The only key to dealing with various affairs without exhausting yourself is in "how to train yourself." One day, she was discussing with her comrades how to carry out the women's work program, and President Roosevelt suddenly called, wanting to discuss something with her. The two of them discussed another issue over the phone for a long time. After talking, she put down the telephone and continued to discuss the women's work case. She immediately continued the discussion from the point where the phone call interrupted, with her head in order and without any confusion. Her clarity of mind can be imagined.</p>
<p>For seven years, Mrs. Roosevelt has had extensive contact with all kinds of people in the government and the public, and she has a thorough understanding of the psychology of people from all walks of life. In addition, she obtained a lot of news from other sources. Of course, much of this news was not very "pleasant to hear," and she always told the President everything. She believes that her husband is the President, high above, surrounded by the high halls and mansions of the White House, and the close-by guards and detectives. Although there are many wise men around him, it is difficult to guarantee that there is no one who specializes in guessing the psychology of those in power, always saying "yes, yes, yes..." On the other hand, the President himself also knows that even his political enemies often refuse to talk frankly in person, so he often says: "Anyone will tell anything to Eleanor." The importance of Mrs. Roosevelt is fully revealed in her husband's understatement.</p>

<h3>Central Daily News Comments on the International Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today's editorial in the Central Daily News stated that the current lull in the wars in Europe and the Far East is likely the calm before a major storm. The future development of the Far East depends on where the Japanese troops now withdrawing from China are sent. The future development of Europe depends on what steps Turkey takes in the Balkans. Now that President Roosevelt has been re-elected, and Germany and Italy's attempts to obtain aid from France have failed, it remains to be seen what actions Germany and Italy will take. Japan's usual trick is to hide behind others. When Germany and Italy take action again, its mask will surely be revealed. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Physical Education Director of the YMCA, Mr. Bretall, Promotes New Type of Basketball Game. Bretall Talks About the Method and Characteristics of the Game. Universally Popular and Exceptionally Interesting.</h3>
<p>Mr. Bretall, Physical Education Director of the local YMCA, returned to Shanghai before last month after his vacation in his home country. While in the United States, Bretall witnessed a new type of basketball game that is very popular there, called "GOAL-HI." After arriving in Shanghai, Bretall plans to promote this new sport and spread it throughout Shanghai. According to Mr. Bretall yesterday, this interesting, safe, and beneficial sport is most suitable for women or junior high school children, but it is also suitable for adults. The playing field is circular, with a common basket in the middle. Ordinary basketball games often have the ball going out of bounds after a shot, but this can be avoided in this game, and the game does not have to be interrupted. The field is divided into two circles. The smaller one is six feet from the basket, called the restricted circle, and the larger one is fifteen feet from this circle, called the free throw circle. Shots made outside the restricted circle but inside the free throw circle score one point. Shots made outside the free throw circle score two points, but shots inside the restricted circle are not allowed. The other rules are similar to those of ordinary basketball games. The game also has two special features: (1) The height of the basket can be raised or lowered at will, to eight feet for junior high school students, nine feet for senior high school students, and ten feet for university students. (2) There is no limit to the number of players. In schools, the entire class can participate in the game at the same time. Therefore, the nature of the game is very universal, and the fun is extraordinarily strong.</p>

<h3>Rising Tide of Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market fluctuated quite a bit yesterday. It was heard that the First Special District had been occupied, and sentiment weakened for a time, but prices were raised again by the bulls, and Class A, D, and E all saw new highs again. Class A was relatively cheap, so the rise was stronger. Class C's market price was too high, so it only rose slightly. The bullish sentiment on the trading floor remained very strong, and it was not easy to fall back for the time being. Some bulls came out, while others were still buying. The general excitement had not diminished. Yesterday morning, Lianhe, Yitai, Jiufeng, Dahua, and Datong bought Class A, D, and E, and new highs were seen again. Some bulls at Tongkang came out, and Renchang also sold. The prices rose another 4 to 7 jiao before noon. In the afternoon, it was heard that the courthouse had been occupied, and the market opened sharply lower by 3 to 8 jiao. Later, the bulls raised prices again, and the market recovered slightly. Lianyi, Jiufeng, Gongmao, and Hongda all bought, while Xinhua and Xinfu sold heavily. Runli Shengda and Wanchun sold quite a bit. Class C broke through the 3 yuan mark, and after that, scattered retail investors covered their short positions, and the price was raised back to 3 yuan. As a result of the close, except for Class C, which fell 1 jiao, the others continued to rise by 1, 2, or up to 7 jiao. The transaction volume was about 2.4 to 2.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match were traded at a price of 94 yuan and 25 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market was affected by the sharp rise in US stocks, and almost all stocks saw new highs not seen in a long time. Brokers estimated that the amount of excessive floating profits this week must be not be small, and they were surprised that very few people made a final settlement yesterday. From this, it can be seen that the strength of new buyers is very strong. Among industrial stocks, the stocks that are often loved by the public led the way. Rubber stocks, after the announcement of dividends, have almost completely recovered their past confidence. Many stocks, including those of East India companies, were in demand.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Thursday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Only bank stocks fluctuated slightly. Mercantile Bank shares rose 3 shillings and 9 pence, to 7 pounds, 1 shilling, and 3 pence. Chartered Bank shares fell 6 shillings and 3 pence, to 10 pounds, 1 shilling, and 3 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>

<h3>British Gold Needs to Shift to Guangdong</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate in the unofficial market showed an uncertain trend. People's sentiments were influenced by rumors of secret agreements, and opinions differed. Generally, speculators aggressively bought US dollars in the morning, while those outside the industry supplied them readily. Prices did not become excessively tight. Foreign firms and Hong Kong Electric, among others, actively bought British pounds, leading to a continued softening and arbitrage. The combined rate was calculated at 3.74 yuan. The closing prices for British gold were 3 pence 875, and for US dollars, 6.0625 yuan, a decrease of 0.03125 compared to the previous day, while the US dollar remained unchanged.

<h3>Evening Selling Pressure Emerged Suddenly, Gold Market Wanted to Rise But Stopped</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for gold bars initially opened high, but as the foreign exchange market showed a soft trend, banks actively bought in, maintaining the price. Furthermore, the market opened firmly in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, selling pressure emerged in the evening, driving the price down. It was heard that securities firms and bullish gold and silver shops were selling. The closing price was only 5527 yuan, down 13 yuan from the previous day. There were 2500 taels traded throughout the day. The price of gold ornaments remained unchanged. Customs gold, etc., were stable.</p>
<p>Gold Bars Dropped 13 Yuan</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the price was slightly pressured due to the soft exchange rate. The opening price was 5520 yuan, with money changers selling 20 taels to banks. Soon, the banks bought in and the price rebounded. Gold shops bought in 30 taels at 5545 yuan. Subsequently, the money changers' intention to sell suddenly emerged, and the upward trend was slightly frustrated. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops, falling to 5528 yuan. Later, the banks continued to absorb some, and the exchange rate turned tight, coupled with optimistic news, and sentiment was firmer. Securities firms entered 20 taels into gold shops, rising to 5562 yuan. By the time of the noon closing, banks were trading 10 taels at 5960 yuan, and the market was very stable. The market continued to rise in the early afternoon. Banks entered gold shops with 10 taels at 5575 yuan. Before long, securities firms entered silver shops with 20 taels, rising another 10 yuan to a high price of 5580 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate was reported to have returned to stable, and the securities firms sold first, immediately falling to 5530 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to silver shops, quoted at 5540 yuan. In addition, the bullish gold and silver shops were selling heavily at this time, and the price could not sustain the continued decline. Securities firms sold to silver shops for 5525 yuan. As a result, banks traded 10 taels, only 5527 yuan, as the closing price, down 13 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 60 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shops' own gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the gold bars, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was hardly any trading.</p>
<p>Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops remained unchanged today. The Dahsiang shop quoted 570 yuan, and the New Tonghang was similar to the previous price, with a purchase price about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Couldn't Gather Momentum</h3>

British gold notes still saw little trading, and the market price remained fixed as before.

<p>Grains</p>
<h3>More Foreign Rice Expected to Arrive This Morning; Foreign Rice Was Still Being Manipulated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China-Lun Foreign Firm's Haida vessel, carrying 17,000 bags of rice from Siam, was mentioned in yesterday's newspaper. According to the company, it is now scheduled to arrive at the port at 8:00 AM this morning and dock at the Bund pier on Beijing Road to unload. (Zhu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was dominated by monopoly, external manipulation, and blind following by speculators, leading to a chaotic market. Furthermore, foreign merchants stated that in addition to the difficulty in securing cargo ship berths, they recently had to increase water freight and military insurance fees, totaling more than 4 yuan per bag. Therefore, the price was immediately raised by 3 yuan. This was because ships transporting rice from Saigon were mostly controlled by French merchants, allowing them to do as they pleased. The recycled original bags in the market also took the opportunity to increase by 2-3 yuan. There were 1400-1500 tons of new transactions, and nearly 1000 tons of recycled rice. No. 1 Saigon rice, previously priced at 72 yuan for December delivery, reached 75 yuan yesterday. No. 2 rice, previously priced at 70 yuan, reached 73 yuan yesterday. No. 1 for immediate loading was also priced at 76.7-77 yuan. With the price increase, the spot price rose by half a yuan in the morning. Later, the street sales also competed to buy, making the situation even tighter, rising all the way up. The highest price was reached at midday, with No. 2 Pagoda Brand bank stock at 64.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5-2 yuan. Subsequently, most of the bulls saw that prices were high and buying interest waned. At the same time, a large number of original roots were thrown out, no less than 5000-6000 bags, and those who had been caged at high prices also came out in large numbers, gradually falling. By the close, the market price had decreased by nearly a yuan, so the resulting closing price actually increased by a yuan. However, in the afternoon, someone started to manipulate again, raising it by about 1 yuan.</p>
<p>New short-grain rice and wild rice of tea varieties are still in short supply, with only 1300-1400 piculs. Sellers were firm, and buyers were eager to buy, leading to a buoyant market with prices rising by a huge 1-2 yuan. Tuan New Short-Grain original bag was priced at 87.5 yuan, and closed at 84 yuan. The price per picul was seen at 82 yuan and closed at 79 yuan. Lu Rice was priced at 80 yuan and 79 yuan. Wild Rice Special was priced at 85 yuan and 84 yuan. Du Short-Grain original bag was priced at 76 yuan, and the price per picul was seen at 72-70 yuan. However, Lamb Short-Grain was flat due to the influence of foreign rice, with an original bag priced at 70 yuan and the price per picul seen at 67 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is currently tight, and in addition to the real sales to wineries and food stalls, there were also large buyers absorbing, so the market was also rising by a yuan. National Glutinous rice opened at 76 yuan, and foreign glutinous rice at 74.5-72 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Foreign Flour Rumored to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Trading in flour is still quiet, and the market remains flat. The price of No. 1 Flour Mill remains unchanged. In addition to supplying daily needs in the street, the sales to customers in Penang have not started, and the recycled goods of various brands are only quoted but not actually sold. The foreign flour market has secretly eased, as rumors spread that a large batch of foreign flour will arrive in Shanghai around the 15th, with only a few days left, and people's hearts are inevitably withering. It is heard that high-grade foreign flour is only selling for 18 yuan 8 jiao, and there are still no buyers for the whole amount. The two mills in the city sold a total of more than 8,000 bags, and 2,000-3,000 bags of foreign flour. The market is as quiet as usual.</p>
<p>The wheat market is still quiet. Japanese mills are buying at the original price, with 100-200 bags of wheat from the suburbs, while the market price must be 27 yuan, because it is very difficult to transport it into the concession, and various expenses are very high, so the difference is as high as 5-6 yuan. It is heard that the Chinese mills are not producing much at present, and there is no way to smoothly purchase raw materials, so they are also waiting and watching, causing the market to become sluggish again.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<h3>Soybeans, Sesame, Raw Peanuts Shipped from North to South</h3>
<p>Imports on the 8th: 460 bags of soybeans and 360 bags of walnuts, all from Tianjin; 400 bags of raw peanuts and 120 bags of peanuts, all from Yantai.</p>
<p>Exports on the 9th: 300 bags of soybeans, 470 bags of sesame, 100 cans of sesame oil, 100 cans of raw oil, and 100 bags of raw peanuts, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Sales to Hong Kong Continue Uninterrupted; Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm, and the monthly price increase trend is gradually advancing. This is because, although there are no wholesale transactions in Hong Kong, the retail purchases continue uninterrupted. Therefore, there is a keen demand for 32-count and 42-count yarns, as well as 10-count coarse yarns, and the selling price is very high. According to this ratio, the price of 20-count yarn is relatively cheap, so a portion of people's minds are changing to be optimistic. It is also said that the inventory of 20-count yarn from the Double Horse factory with single chips in the market has decreased by about 5000-6000 bags, but if the sales of 20-count yarn do not expand at present, and until the actual sales rise, the market cannot rise.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened in the morning with a good tone due to the high sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The first price of 20-count Double Horse was 1220 yuan, rising slightly to 1228 yuan. At this time, it was argued that the US loan had another 800,000 established. This bearish news slightly increased the pressure of selling, falling to 1217 yuan. However, once the price eased, there was a lack of selling, and the sellers thought about making up for it, thereby tightening the inventory and rapidly rising the market price to 1234 yuan. Subsequently, profit-taking weakened slightly, and the closing price was 1231 yuan. According to statistics, 4415 bags were traded in half a day, and the price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 11 yuan. The amounts purchased by various guilds are listed as follows:</p>
<p>The afternoon yarn market continued to advance with a good rising tone. The market price of 20-count Double Horse in the yarn market exchange opened at 1237 yuan, with 40 bags traded. People's sentiments are solid. 590 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>No Hope for Local Cotton Source</h3>
<p>Although trading in spot cotton is rare, the general sentiment is optimistic. This is because the inventory of cotton is dwindling, and there is no hope for sources from various routes. What comes are all scattered amounts, but currently the manufacturers are eager to buy, and once the demand comes, the market price is likely to be seen higher.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Customer Groups Rush to Buy Hot-Selling Goods</h3>
<p>The fabric market yesterday showed a strong trend with good sentiment. The local industry and hoarders were actively buying and selling. Customer groups selected hot-selling goods and searched for them. The selling price of fine cloth and fine twill were stable. The price of Ewo coarse cloth also leveled, while the price of the local mill's light and heavy weights fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. The prices of bleached and dyed cloth varied slightly. Orders for spring yarn thread and net cloth have been placed one after another. The Hongzhang Mill's futures striped lining cloth was quoted at 1 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen per yard. The ready-made goods of Guangzhong and other mills were traded in the market. More than 600 pieces of various goods were traded in the local street. The Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Ningbo customer groups bought more than 200 pieces of fine cloth, blue cloth, and flannel. The Fujian and Guangdong customer groups bought 200+ pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth. 530 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Camel's Wool Flannel Overcoats - Following Cavalry Twill -</h3>
<p>The sales of woolen fabrics were very strong yesterday, but the Nanjing group is gradually experiencing shortages due to the difficulty of transporting woolen fabrics. It is heard that the Ewo Cavalry Twill, which sells for 23-24 yuan per yard in Shanghai, can be sold for 33-34 yuan in the Nanjing market. In light of this, many brokers carry 5-6 sets or 30-40 yards with them, traveling back and forth to sell every week or ten days.</p>
<p>Camel's wool flannel has recently become very popular, and the market is exceptionally firm. The current price for spot delivery of imported goods is 44 yuan per yard, and 45.5 yuan for those with Western characters woven on the edge. Local mill goods of Shanghai weaving sell for 24-25 yuan for ordinary goods and around 30 yuan for first-class goods. The market for Cavalry Twill is relatively flat and the trend is not as popular as Camel's wool flannel. Currently, Chinese and Western style overcoats are the same, and Camel's wool flannel is more popular than Cavalry Twill.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<h3>Black Melon Seeds Turn Down</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have recently seen sluggish sales and a decline in the downstream market, falling by varying amounts of 5-6 yuan. For example, large sliced Ji Kui seeds are now selling for 105 yuan, Xu Kui seeds for 96 yuan, and Chinese style seeds for around 90 yuan to 86-87 yuan. Dalian seeds are at 78 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Foreign Sugar Stockpiling Resurges</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend continued to rise yesterday with new stockpiles being absorbed. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar from the local warehouse was 71 yuan 5 jiao, while the price from outside warehouses was 71-71.3 yuan, up 3 jiao. The Swire Car White B Mark from the western warehouse was 72.3-72.5 yuan, and from the eastern warehouse was 71.5-71.7 yuan, up 7 jiao. The DY Mark from the eastern warehouse was 67.1-67.2 yuan, also up 7 jiao. The HX Mark from the western warehouse was 67 yuan, and from the eastern warehouse was 66.8 yuan, up 4 jiao. The MH Mark from the eastern warehouse was 63 yuan. The H Mark red sand from the eastern warehouse was 53 yuan. The Dutch cotton white high grade RA Mark was 71 yuan, and the delivery goods BS Mark was 68 yuan. The spot price of Dutch red sugar was 55-55.4 yuan, and the one for November 18th listing was 55.3-55.5 yuan, up 4-5 jiao. A total of more than 5000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<h3>Coal Balls Add Factory Price Again - 7 Yuan 6 Jiao per Load -</h3>
<p>Due to the soaring price of raw materials recently, the new water freight of Yitai Hing coal balls reaches 33 shillings per ton (more than one legal currency silver dollar), and the cost is closely related. Therefore, the factory price has temporarily increased by 8 yuan from yesterday. The price for the same industry to pick up each ton is 140 yuan and the price delivered to the door is 152 yuan, 7 yuan and 6 jiao per load. As for raw materials, it is intended to find a way to recover the original state in order to make the ignition resistance the main one. It is heard that other small factories will also increase the price in the coming days.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Flat White Iron Rises Sharply, Tin Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The market for flat white iron has recently seen intermittent interest from local river traders, street stockpilers, and small-scale construction users, leading to unusually sharp price increases. Currently, 7-foot sizes are priced at 8.989 yuan, and 6-foot sizes at 7.78 yuan. Market inventories are limited, and overseas shipments have ceased, indicating a strong upward trend.</p>
<p>The tin market is affected by imports from Hong Kong, causing a noticeable shortage of spot goods in the local market. This has led to bullish sentiment among dealers, with standard prices trending upward. Yesterday, 99.99% pure tin was quoted at 1,500 yuan, with most demand coming from small-scale buyers in this district. Transactions from dealers and wholesalers are relatively rare.</p>

<h3>French Concession Court Seized, Foreign Ministry Lodges Serious Protest, French Side Should Bear Full Responsibility for Violating the Agreement, Protectors of Law Have All Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The status of the French Concession Court has changed since yesterday. The Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court were forcibly taken over yesterday under the guard of the French police and the support of the Japanese military police. The French Consul General, M. Mager, has instructed Havas News Agency to issue a statement publicly announcing a compromise with the Japanese side, transferring the "jurisdiction" of the two courts. Thus, the fourteen articles of the Sino-French agreement on the French Concession Court, signed on July 28, 1931, have been unilaterally violated.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Statement, Solemn Position</p>
<p>Chongqing, 8th Dispatch: Regarding the seizure of the Chinese court in the Shanghai French Concession, the Foreign Ministry spokesman issued the following statement today: "The Ministry has just received a notification from the French side stating that the Shanghai French Concession authorities concluded an agreement on the 7th of this month, allowing a certain party to take over the Chinese court within the concession, and this has been implemented this morning." After investigation, we have repeatedly stated to the French side regarding this matter that if the Chinese court in the French Concession is seized, not only will the physical and property of Chinese residents be constrained, but also the rights and interests of foreigners will be endangered. We have repeatedly demanded that the French side strictly refuse and pay attention to the serious responsibility it bears for this matter. However, the French side has yielded and, at the cost of violating the Sino-French agreement on the establishment of the Chinese court in the Shanghai French Concession on July 28, 1931, illegally transferred it. The Ministry has lodged a serious protest with the French side. Under the above circumstances, our government has no choice but to order the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to temporarily cease exercising their functions within the French Concession. Hereafter, any organization claiming to be a Chinese court within the French Concession is naturally illegal, and all its judgments and any other actions are invalid. The French side shall bear all responsibility."</p>
<p>First Invasion of the Higher Court Third Branch</p>
<p>At 10:20 AM yesterday, two cars of the French Concession Defense Forces with registration numbers 251 and 382, and three other black-plated cars suddenly drove to the entrance of Lane 23, West End Avenue, where the Higher Court Third Branch was located. The drivers were all wearing Japanese military police uniforms. Immediately, twelve Japanese plainclothes personnel and twenty other Chinese, including Qiao Wanxuan, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Higher Court Third Branch, and Sun Shaokang, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court, rushed into the Higher Court Third Branch. She Gen, the Chief Advisor of the Legal Advisory Office of the French Concession Council, had arrived at the court beforehand to wait.</p>
<p>President Begs for Help without Success</p>
<p>When these individuals arrived at the court, Zhan Jifeng also entered with them. It is rumored that Zhan is the so-called "Special Commissioner" for "receiving" the French Concession Court. It is also rumored that Geng Jiaki was also among them when he went to "receive" the court. In addition, there were many newly "appointed" "judges." At that time, Yang Peng, the President of the Higher Court Third Branch, was not at the court. After learning of the incident from his residence, he immediately called the French Concession authorities for help. However, the French Concession authorities were vague and evasive. After several negotiations, he failed to get any support.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Impatiently Transfers Without Authorization</p>
<p>At that time, the French Concession had stationed ten Annamite soldiers and an armored car No. 32 at the entrance of the Higher Court Third Branch. In addition, there were a large number of armed police officers who did not prevent the forced takeover of the court. Qiao Wanxuan, the Chief Prosecutor who had not been to the court for a long time, took the liberty of handling the "transfer." At the same time, the receiving personnel took out more than ten pre-filled "appointment letters" and asked the judges of the court to accept the appointment. They did not leave until about 11:40 AM, and the Higher Court Third Branch changed in nature from then on.</p>
<p>Most Judges Upright and Unyielding</p>
<p>When these people carried out a "takeover" at the Higher Court Third Branch, they immediately notified the Second Court of the Special District by telephone in the name of the Higher Court Third Branch, instructing the President of the court, Chen Mao Xian, to go to the Higher Court Third Branch to handle the transfer. At that time, President Chen did not agree to go, but because of the adverse environment, he only agreed to wait at the Second Special Court. Before long, President Chen quietly left because the attitude of the French authorities was unclear and it was impossible to save the situation. Judges who left with President Chen included Liao Yan, Li Liang, Chen Ziguan, Yu Changzi, Sun Pengxian, Ma Yishu, Qiu Huan Ying, Zhu Chuzhe, Jiang Liquan, and others. It was also learned that at about 11:00 AM yesterday, the "clerk of the Higher Court Third Branch" called the Second Special Court, saying that they would come to "take over" in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Second Special Court Occupied in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At 1:10 PM, five cars drove to the front of the Second Special District Local Court, including the aforementioned two Defense Forces registered cars and three black-plated registered cars of Sun Shaokang with registration number 11103. Six Japanese plainclothes personnel and more than ten Chinese, including Sun Shaokang, rushed into the Second Special District Local Court. At that time, Sun Shaokang also hired a Xiang Sheng dispatch car with registration number 17073 to bring tea and refreshments to the court for hospitality. Thus, the Second Special Court, like the Higher Court Third Branch, also changed in nature.</p>
<p>Second Special Prison Changed Accordingly</p>
<p>The Second Special Court Prison, located near the Second Special Court, opposite the Legal Advisory Office of the French Concession Council on Massenet Road, was also requested by two Japanese, Huang Yaqiang, who served as the deputy warden in the court, and six or seven other Chinese, along with French police officers and Dugen, the Chief Advisor of the French Concession, to "transfer" the prison at about 3:00 PM yesterday. Warden Zhao Xinyu happened to be ill in bed and, forced by circumstances, "transferred" the seals, public funds, guard firearms, and prisoner lists. Huang Yaqiang was acting as the "Warden."</p>
<p>More People Will Withdraw Today</p>
<p>As for the "appointment letters" for this new location, (1) those on the Higher Court Third Branch side included Qiao Wanxuan as "President of the Higher Court Third Branch," Liu Zhaofu as "Chief Prosecutor," Wang Jian as "President of the Civil Court," and Tan Liming as "President of the Criminal Court." (2) Those on the Second Special Court side included Sun Shaokang as "President," Zhou Darin as "Chief Prosecutor," Zhang Mingsheng as "President of the Civil Court" (according to another source, Zhang left the court upon hearing the news), and Yuan Xiaogen as "President of the Criminal Court." In addition, the "judges" and "prosecutors" of the other two courts were also given pre-filled "appointment letters." However, it is not yet known who accepted these "appointments." It is widely believed that many judges and prosecutors will uphold the central government today and prepare to withdraw. The colleagues in the Second Special Prison will also withdraw from today. In addition, all the bailiffs of the Second Special Court expressed their unwillingness to continue in their positions yesterday.</p>
<p>Security Tightened, Searches Thorough</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities had long heard of the great changes that took place in the two courts in the French Concession yesterday and did not reject them. At that time, the French authorities stationed ten Annamite soldiers in addition to the original No. 32 heavy armored car at the lane entrance of the Higher Court Third Branch on West End Avenue. A large number of police officers were also stationed at both ends of West End Avenue, such as the intersection of Rue du Pere Froc and Avenue Albert, and searched pedestrians passing by. As for the front of the Second Special Court, an armored car No. 17 was parked. An armored car No. 23 was parked in front of the Second Special Prison at the intersection of Rue Massenet. In addition, a large number of armed police officers were stationed on the surrounding roads to guard and search vehicles and pedestrians.</p>
<p>American Newspaper Reporter Prevented from Taking Photos</p>
<p>When the Higher Court Third Branch was "taken over," Xu Huazhi, a reporter for the English-language China Press, went to investigate. When she passed by the court on West End Avenue, she was searched by the detectives guarding the court four times. Afterwards, when Xu took out her camera to take pictures of the court, she was stopped by the French police and arrested. She was taken to the police station and released after it was discovered that her photos had not been taken. However, when reporters from the Pingming News Agency went to inspect the Second Special Court on Rue Hua Li, they saw several Japanese newspaper reporters repeatedly taking pictures of the court, and the French police did not stop them.</p>
<h3>North Jiangxi Road Further Reinforced with Steel</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Japanese marines were seen again erecting barbed wire along North Jiangxi Road. According to a Japanese Navy spokesman yesterday, this was due to a terrorist incident that occurred in the area. It was reported that on Tuesday (the 5th), a Japanese Navy Ensign Nakamura was shot near North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Road Stops Commercial Cargo, Military Transport Frequent, Commercial Transport Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road on the 18th of this month, military transport has been frequent. A large number of military supplies and ordered military equipment detained in Rangoon are still awaiting shipment in batches. According to visitors from the Southwest, the transport vehicles on this road are serving day and night without stopping for a moment. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the carriage of commercial goods to avoid hindering military affairs and to facilitate the inspection of contraband. Yesterday's report that the road restricted freight transport referred only to commercial goods and did not mean that general freight transport was generally restricted.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Ha Na and Fei Kang Liners Detained Again by Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news spread in the shipping industry that the Ha Na and Fei Kang liners were again detained by Japanese warships off the coast of Wenzhou. There has been no telegram from the Far Eastern Company and Lu Lin Yanghang, so it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Second U.S. Evacuation Ship Telegraphed Delay in Arrival to Shanghai; Expected to Arrive Noon the Day After Tomorrow and Set Sail That Night; Will Go to North China via Korea Before Returning to the U.S.</h3>
<p>The second special ship assigned by the U.S. government to the Far East to carry evacuating citizens, the "Mariposa" steamship of the Matson Navigation Company, has already departed from San Francisco. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this Sunday (the 10th), the local agent for the ship, American President Lines, announced yesterday that they had received a telegram from the ship stating that the arrival date would be delayed by one day.</p>
<p>Two Small Ferry Boat Runs Scheduled</p>
<p>It is expected to arrive at the port at 11:00 AM on Monday (the 11th), berthing at buoys 11 and 12. A small steamer for crew and workers to go ashore will arrive at the New Customs Wharf around 12:30 PM. The steamship does not plan to linger in Shanghai and will set sail that night (the 11th) at midnight to return to the U.S. The last small steamer runs for evacuating citizens to board the ship will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 5:30 PM and 7:30 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>Sailing to Qinhuangdao and Then Incheon</p>
<p>The original plan to rush to Kemlou and incorporate the passengers there has changed. Now, instead of Tianjin, it will depart from Shanghai on the evening of the 11th for Qinhuangdao. On the 12th, it will depart from Qinhuangdao for Incheon (Korea). It will set sail from Incheon on the 15th. Whether it will stop at Kobe is still undecided. If it does stop there, it will depart from Kobe for Honolulu on the 17th and return to San Francisco. The third special ship, the "Washington," is expected to arrive around the 17th.</p>
<p>Over 500 Evacuees from Various Locations</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," sources at American President Lines said that the U.S. evacuation ship "Mariposa" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 11:30 AM on the 11th and set sail at 9:00 PM that night. 85 American expatriates in Shanghai will depart on the ship. The "Mariposa" will arrive in Qinhuangdao on the 13th. 230 American expatriates from Peiping and Tianjin will also arrive in Qinhuangdao at the same time by special train and transfer to the ship. It will set sail that evening and sail to Incheon, Korea, on the 15th. There are also about 100 American expatriates there who will board the ship, for a total of 915 people, who will start their journey back to the U.S.</p>
<p>The Third Evacuation Ship Has Many Passengers</p>
<p>Moreover, many American expatriates in Shanghai are now purchasing tickets from American President Lines for the third evacuation ship, the "Washington." The "Washington" is scheduled to arrive here on the 17th of this month and depart on the 21st. Many American expatriates in Shanghai are taking this ship back to their country, especially the members of today's meetings.</p>
<p>"Isabel" Sails Up the Yangtze River</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," the fast warship "Isabel," flagship of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, left Shanghai this morning (the 8th) at 8:00 AM. As usual, it will sail up the Yangtze River to Wuhu to investigate the situation of American expatriates along the river. The ship carries hospital supplies to supply American expatriates at various ports between Wuhu and Shanghai. In addition, 39 family members of U.S. Navy personnel and 8 family members of Marine Corps personnel left Shanghai on the "President Coolidge" steamship at dawn today. As of this point, only 38 family members of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel remain in Shanghai awaiting evacuation.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Term of Low-Priced Rice Sales Ends Early; Rice Supply Insufficient, Ending One Day Early</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has held six terms of low-priced foreign rice sales. The seventh term just started on the 1st of this month (originally each term was 20 days, but the rice supply for this term was only 28,000 bags, insufficient for 20 days). It was scheduled to end on the 19th, so the total number of bags for the seventh term is 208,000 bags (30,000 bags per term, with 180,000 bags already sold in the six terms, plus 28,000 bags for this term). It is estimated that each 30,000 bags can generate sales of 690,000 to 720,000 yuan, and the total sales for the seven terms will be 4,795,500 to 5,004,000 yuan. 400,000 poor people benefited each term, and over 2.8 million people benefited from the seven terms. The committee has no definite news on whether it will hold another term after this term ends.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of the Forced Purchase of Five Portuguese Ships; Price Offered Only 400,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Portuguese merchant ships "Lee Po," "Fook Lo," "Meida," "Feisite" (transliteration), "Meli," etc., which previously operated on the Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Taiwan, and Shanghai-Dinghai lines, have been detained for over a year. They were suddenly forcibly purchased by the Japanese side at a reduced price. It is reported that the price of the five ships is only 400,500 yuan in national currency. The Japanese company "Zhonghua Company" took "receipt" of them on the 6th, and all crew members guarding the ships were expelled ashore.</p>

Half of the proceeds from the flower sale on that day will be transferred to the Central British War Fund for the use of the Red Cross. At 8:30 AM, wreaths will be laid at the Armistice Day Memorial. As for individual members of the British community, they will not lay wreaths separately, but will convert the price of the flowers they intended to lay into a donation to the Central British War Fund. No commemorative services will be held on that day, but a special ceremony will be held at the Community Church on Kiukiang Road the day before. All other gatherings, such as dinners and concerts, will be suspended. On that day, all British community members will wear flowers to commemorate the glorious martyrs.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Implements Controls; Importers Must Pay a Security Deposit; Exporters Must Pay a Deposit</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Finance &amp; Commerce," the Japanese will soon implement controls on import trade in Central China and Shanghai. Merchants can only purchase goods from Japanese groups, and they cannot be transported to occupied areas. Transactions must use Japanese military scrip, and merchants must pay a cash deposit to restrict the transportation of goods to various locations. Regarding export trade, the Japanese will also find ways to obtain the foreign exchange of exporters, and export trade must also pay a deposit. The reason for this is not yet clear, but under the current circumstances, it is unlikely to be implemented in Shanghai. However, Shanghai is surrounded by their control, and if merchants in Shanghai do not agree to the Japanese method, they will be isolated from the occupied areas and can only operate in a corner of the International Settlement. At the same time, the Japanese are planning to organize the "Far East Bristle Trading Company" with a capital of one million yuan to control the export trade of bristles in Central China. The export of bristles in North China has always been managed exclusively by Mitsui &amp; Co., and foreign merchants of third-party nationalities have no way to obtain sufficient supply, and the foreign exchange from export is also pocketed by the Japanese. Central China will also follow the current method in North China, and a foreign exchange income will flow from the open market into the hands of the Japanese. If foreign merchants want to continue to engage in bristle trade, there must be other conditions for the disposal of the US dollars obtained from export. Currently, two-thirds of the exported bristles are shipped to the United States, and 25% are shipped to the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Promote National Savings for Reconstruction and Conscript Winter Clothing; Simultaneously Held in Shanghai; National Savings for Reconstruction Week Starts Tomorrow; The Weather Is Cold and Winter Clothing Is Urgently Needed</h3>
<p>The National Savings for Reconstruction Movement Committee has issued an order to all parts of the country to hold a National Savings for Reconstruction Movement expanded publicity week from the 10th to the 16th of this month. Various groups in Shanghai have recently been ordered by the Central Party Headquarters to promote it unanimously in order to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the goal of national reconstruction. However, due to the special environment of the Shanghai Settlement area, postal remittance bureaus and the four branches of the Central, Bank of China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks did not issue National Savings for Reconstruction Certificates.</p>
<p>Method of Purchasing Certificates</p>
<p>Therefore, citizens who want to purchase savings certificates can entrust various banks and bureaus to purchase them from Hong Kong. Those who want to open National Savings for Reconstruction accounts can directly apply to various banks and bureaus. National currency of one yuan or more can be used to open an account, and deposits can be made at any time thereafter. In addition to the respective banks and bureaus responsible for the savings money and certificates to the depositors, the government guarantees the safety of the principal and interest. The unit of the National Savings for Reconstruction Certificate is national currency, but savings may be stored in foreign currency and gold and silver. If stored in foreign currency at maturity, the principal and interest will still be repaid in foreign currency. If stored in gold and silver, it will be converted into legal tender according to the supplementary measures of the Ministry of Finance's exchange of legal tender, and a handling fee will be added and included in the principal. Savings certificates and deposit books are specially allowed to be used as substitutes when public officials pay security deposits. At the same time, the government specially allows exemption from income tax on interest income.</p>
<p>Winter Clothing Donation</p>
<p>The movement to raise money for winter clothing, launched by various circles in Shanghai, has been extended by one month to the end of this month after a joint request to extend the donation period and a telegram reply from the Chongqing Donation Headquarters. All circles are working harder than ever on fundraising, and various public associations, public and private organizations, schools, banks, and other collection agencies have been working more intensively recently. Given that the weather in Shanghai has turned cold recently, the severe cold in the future can be imagined. Therefore, based on the current situation of enthusiastic donations, the hope of exceeding one million yuan should be within expectations. All circles have also decided to expand the promotion of the National Savings for Reconstruction Movement on the 12th of this month, the anniversary of the birth of the national father, and the anniversary of the Western Withdrawal of the National Army three years later. This is so that the front-line soldiers can have winter clothes and equipment to get through the harsh winter.</p>
<p>In addition, since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association published an appeal to all walks of life to solicit winter clothes, many people have responded and donated money. However, the severe cold has suddenly arrived, and the relief of the old and young refugees in the various shelters cannot be delayed. Therefore, the association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life can continue to solicit donations to complete this great charitable cause.</p>
<h3>U.S. Marine Corps Anniversary; Birthday Banquet; Held This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 165th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Marine Corps. Every year on this day, the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai must hold a grand celebration and commemoration. The Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet and the Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment will conduct a review. The soldiers of the team will also play a ball game with friendly teams to determine the annual championship. However, the situation this year is special. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, has gone to Nicaragua, so there is no commemorative ceremony. Even the exercises of the Fourth Marine Regiment are unlikely to be held. Because tomorrow is a Sunday, for the sake of convenience, a banquet will be held this afternoon at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill ground on Foochow Road to celebrate the Navy "Birthday Anniversary". All officers and soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps will participate at that time. Colonel Baker, Rear Admiral Glassford, and the Commander-in-Chief and all members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will also be invited to participate. Senior officials of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department will also attend the banquet on time, and there will be boxing and other programs to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>Two Settlements; Expand Safety Movement; Excellent Results Last Year Reduced Accidents; This Year's Universal Publicity Seeks Greater Perfection</h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," the police of the Public Settlement and the French Settlement are cooperating to carry out the "Safety First" movement in order to reduce traffic accidents in the settlements. The movement, which was originally scheduled to be held in June, has now been extended to start on the 18th of this month and end on the 27th. The implementation method is roughly the same as last year.</p>
<p>Screening Films for Propaganda</p>
<p>The authorities have newly filmed a "Safety First" film, which will be screened in various cinemas in the city, with explanations in the Shanghai dialect. A special truck has also been prepared, equipped with a projector and other equipment, to go to various factories to screen the "Safety First" film. At the same time, a phonograph record will be used to explain the meaning of each scene in the film so that workers can understand the purpose of the movement.</p>
<p>Distributing One Million Leaflets</p>
<p>In addition, propaganda banners will be posted in prominent locations in the settlement, and one million leaflets will be distributed to citizens. The Traffic Division of the police departments of the two settlements will also send letters to all car owners in the city, with a pamphlet explaining how to avoid accidents. Car owners will also attach a paper flag to the windshield and two long flags to the side windows, which must not be attached to the rear window.</p>
<p>Chinese Students Mobilized to Assist</p>
<p>The "Safety First" movement held by the two settlements last year achieved excellent results, with accidents and casualties reduced by 22%. The authorities hope that this year's movement will be even more perfect. A large number of Chinese students have volunteered to serve, and they will wear special armbands and stand at intersections to explain prevention methods to pedestrians in order to avoid accidental injuries. At the same time, slogan flags will be distributed to various rickshaws, bicycles, and other light vehicles and pasted in conspicuous places.</p>
<p>Radio Stations Will Also Cooperate</p>
<p>However, the propaganda posters printed this year are the same as those used last year, and their number is far less than last year, because they are only pasted in the shop windows of Nanjing Road and other thoroughfares. The authorities also plan to obtain the cooperation of Shanghai radio stations to broadcast and elaborate on the importance of "Safety First" in order to ensure the greatest success of the movement. The implementation procedures on the French Settlement side are exactly the same as those in the Public Settlement.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company; Rumor of Price Increase Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Adding 30% to Current Prices: Since the French Electricity and Water Company had its water and electricity fees approved by the French Municipal Council, it has been implemented on the 6th of this month. It is rumored that the fare increase for trams has also been completed, and it is scheduled to be announced and implemented tomorrow (the 10th). The amount of the increase is 30% of the current fare. Currently, the lowest fare for the French tram is two cents for third class and three cents for first class. If the price increase is implemented, the lowest fare for first class will be four cents and three cents for third class.</p>
<h3>Group Rice Purchase; Responses Are Enthusiastic; Abundant Supply, Rice Prices Rise Instead; Hong Kong Approves Daily Shipment of 5,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market, despite abundant arrivals and full reserves, rebounded by more than one yuan per picul. The price of No. 1 Saigon rice per picul had already fallen to 61 yuan. After the rebound in the past two days, it has reached 64 yuan. The general public is worried. If the relevant authorities do not take measures to suppress it, the future of the people's food supply is worrying.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exports</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned that although Hong Kong is not a rice-producing area, it is adjacent to Nanyang, making it a hub for foreign rice transportation. Previously, due to the tense situation, rice exports were prohibited. Later, as the situation eased slightly, the ban was lifted. Now, it is stipulated that the daily export quota for rice is 5,000 bags, and the amount shipped to Shanghai reaches more than 2,000 bags per day. It is transported only by the Nanyang liners of the British Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies, which greatly benefits the supply of rice in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's "Yuezhou" wheel, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, was loaded with 2,167 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong and unloaded at the Bund of the French Settlement yesterday.</p>
<p>Group Registration</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association has been making every effort to promote group rice purchases in order to replenish the amount stored in Shanghai. Twenty-seven batches have already been handled. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency learned that merchants have been flocking to the association on the third floor of the YMCA on Montauban Road to inquire about rice ordering procedures. It is said that the association is currently handling the 28th batch of group rice purchases so that they can order from overseas as soon as possible. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai has also persuaded its members to participate in group rice purchases. Many fellow villagers have gone to the association to collect registration forms and fill them out to order rice.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Epidemic Prevention Personnel Arrive in Ningbo to Assist in Eradicating the Plague</h3>
<p>The Ningbo plague prevention situation was telegraphed as follows yesterday: (1) A group of more than 30 epidemic prevention personnel from the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department arrived in Ningbo yesterday and will work with Ningbo epidemic prevention personnel. (2) The Ningbo Epidemic Prevention Department announced yesterday that the A-level isolation hospital newly admitted five patients with the plague and eight died, bringing the total number of deaths to 45 and 14 still under treatment.

The C-level isolation hospital also examined and found seven people with the plague. (3) The Yin County government, in order to step up the implementation of epidemic prevention, specially convened a meeting of important officials and doctors from various hospitals at 4:00 PM yesterday to review the situation. Secretary Zhang Hongbin, the chairman, decided to establish an epidemic prevention office, and the staff members were assigned. Every day from 7:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, they will concentrate on working in the county government. If there are any emergencies, they will be convened temporarily.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Council Commemorate Hu Yongqi</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Yongqi, a member of the Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, passed away on the 5th of this month. The council and the Works Committee recently sent condolences to his family.

There were many elegiac couplets sent by Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, and various groups. After a religious ceremony, silent flower offering, singing, and scripture reading, the body was sent to the Hongqiao Cemetery for burial. The funeral was somber and grand with white horses and plain cars.</p>
<h3>Refugee Population Statistics</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 7th of this month, there are currently 13 shelters with a total of 15,440 refugees.</p>

<h3>Gong Hongzhao Died of Illness; Concealed Assets While Gasping for Breath; Shen Zhujiu Opposes Limited Inheritance; Yesterday's Hearing Included Testimony and Verification</h3>
<p>Xi Hongzhao, a native of Chongming and former principal of the Zhengxing Girls' Middle School on Qianfu Road, was the chairman of the Chongming Boji Pawnshop and practiced law in Shanghai. Xi and Shen Zhujiu, a wealthy merchant from Chongming, were related through marriage. Shen's eldest daughter, Yaomei, is twenty-eight years old this year and is Xi's cousin. Yaomei once worked as a teacher in Shanghai, and Xi was the principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School. They were both in the education field and</p>
<p>were of similar age.</p>
<p>The relationship between the cousins developed into a physical love affair. Xi already had a wife, Gu, and children. Yaomei, due to her entanglement with Xi, willingly became Xi's concubine. In July of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, she stole ten gold pounds, several taels of jewelry, and a large sum of cash from her father and eloped with Xi. That year, a lawsuit was filed in the Second Special District Court, resulting in Xi Hongzhao being sentenced to three months in prison and his lawyer's license being revoked. Shen Zhujiu was also fined for defamation, but Yaomei continued to</p>
<p>cohabit with Gong.</p>
<p>Because Yaomei was of age, Shen Zhujiu could not interfere with her marriage. Xi Hongzhao died in his Shanghai residence on June 124th of last year. His household was managed by his wife, Gu. Although Yaomei lived in Xi's house, she was often ridiculed. On September 18th of last year, Gu suddenly petitioned the court for limited inheritance, claiming that Xi Hongzhao had few assets and only a 500 yuan share in the Boji Pawnshop. Shen Zhujiu, due to Xi Hongzhao owing him a considerable amount of debt, and his daughter Yao央 being unable to bear the ridicule, also</p>
<p>returned to the Gong family.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shen Zhujiu recently hired lawyer Yu Chengxiu to file a petition in the First Special District Court, requesting confirmation that Xi Gu氏's petition for limited inheritance of Xi Hongzhao's estate was invalid and that Gu had concealed Xi Hongzhao's assets. Judge Tao Dejun opened a civil court yesterday to summon the defendant, Xi Gu氏. Due to illness, Xi Gu氏 did not appear in court and appointed lawyer Lu Jiating to represent her. The plaintiff, Shen Zhujiu, along with lawyer Yu Chengxiu, appeared in court and stated that the deceased, Xi Hongzhao, had seduced and eloped with the plaintiff's daughter, Shen Yao, taking away gold pounds, gold bracelets, and cash. Although a lawsuit was filed in the Second Special District Court,</p>
<p>the items were not recovered.</p>
<p>The items taken away were hidden by Xi Hongzhao in a safe deposit box at the Four Banks Savings Society. Xi Hongzhao's personal assets were also hidden in that safe deposit box. The defendant, Xi Gu氏, petitioned for limited inheritance on September 18th of this year. Why did she repeatedly open the safe deposit box on November 3rd, 7th, 8th, and 28th of last year? Xi Hongzhao had a share capital of 8,000 yuan in the Boji Pawnshop. Why did she say it was only 500 yuan? It is evident that the defendant intended to conceal assets. The court verified the testimony and ordered a change to summon witnesses for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Son Ill and Unemployed; Mother and Daughter Commit Suicide; Both Die from Poisoning</h3>
<p>Xu Yang氏, an old woman from Yangzhou, resided in the front room of Building 27, Alley 280, Sapore Road. She was sixty years old. Her son, Xiao Yun, had recently become unemployed and was bedridden at Guangci Hospital. He had been ill for a long time and was unable to make ends meet due to financial difficulties. Xu committed suicide with her twenty-two-year-old daughter, Xu Lubao, on the night of the seventh, taking poison together. At four o'clock yesterday morning, the male servant, Sun You, heard moaning sounds and entered the room to investigate. The smell of poison was overwhelming. There were two empty bottles on the table. Xu and her daughter were unconscious and pale. He immediately reported to the police, who sent them to Guangpu Hospital. However, they died before they could be treated. The patrol police sent the bodies to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<h3>Modern Girl Jumps to Her Death</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, a middle-aged man jumped to his death from a window on the very high floor of the building at No. 201, Maisi West Love Road in the Shazui Concession. He fell to the ground from a great height, instantly breaking his head, splattering his brains, and dying. Passersby discovered him and reported to the police. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and then transported the body to Guangci Hospital for examination.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 7:15 PM, a modern girl (in her twenties) suddenly jumped out of a window on the third floor of an apartment at No. 101, Mai Liangxi Love Road in the French Concession, attempting suicide. She fell into the road and suffered extremely severe head injuries, dying at the scene. Later, Chinese police arrived at the scene and rushed her to Guangci Hospital for examination. The detectives found a note on her person, which read "No. 5, Alley 534, Xiafei Road." The detectives immediately went to the address to investigate, but the people at that address said they did not know her. The police are still investigating the girl's name.</p>
<h3>Youth Killed by Vietnamese Police Officer is Son of Zhu Qinglan; Zhu Family Hires Lawyer to Negotiate</h3>
<p>It is reported that Zhu Hua (20 years old) and Zhu Shu (18 years old), brothers from Shaoxing, were at the intersection of La Du Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession on the evening of the 5th of this month. They saw a rascal, Xu Genfu, teasing a modern girl along the road in Futing alone. Zhu and others stepped forward to intervene, and a conflict arose. It is unknown how, but a misunderstanding occurred with Vietnamese police officer No. 368 on patrol. The officer fired a shot, hitting Zhu Hua in the abdomen. He died in the hospital the next day. It is now learned that the deceased Zhu Hua is the son of General Zhu Qinglan (Ziqiao). The Zhu family has reportedly hired a French lawyer to represent them in negotiations with the French authorities.</p>
<h3>Yin Junong, Owner of Lengxiang Pavilion, Sues Husband for Divorce; Demands Return of More Than 20,000 Yuan in Dowry; Both Parties Absent from Court, Hearing Adjourned</h3>
<p>Yin Junong, nicknamed Si, the daughter of the late Shanghai pediatrician Yin Shoutian, is twenty-six years old. She resides at No. 3, Alley 65, Lei Shangda Road. She is a passionate Kunqu opera enthusiast and is known by her stage name "Owner of Lengxiang Pavilion." In January of the twenty-something year of the Republic of China, she was introduced by Xia Yingtang and Xie Zenghe and married Chen Zonghui (twenty-four years old this year, father's name is Qiongliang), the son of Chen Weiquan, a major antique and jewelry merchant from Nanke, at the New Asia Restaurant auditorium on North Sichuan Road. Initially, their love was strong, and they had two daughters, the elder named Qiulai (five years old) and the younger named Meimei (four years old). However, Junong spent</p>
<p>too much time indulging in Kunqu opera</p>
<p>outside the home, more than at home. Zonghui repeatedly advised her, but Yin acted insincerely, leading to disagreements. From then on, the couple's feelings gradually deteriorated, becoming irreconcilable. Yin returned to her mother's home. Although Chen rented a Western-style house at No. 593, Lafayette Road, to bring Yin home to live with him, she refused. Chen then frequented singing and dancing halls, developing an entanglement with Zhou Lianfang (nineteen years old, from Taizhou), a dancer at the Xianle Dance Hall. Yin discovered this and reported it to the French police at 5:30 AM on March 28th of this year,</p>
<p>who caught them in the act</p>
<p>and took them to the Criminal Court 8 of the Second Special Court. Judge Li Weiju sentenced Chen Zonghui for adultery and Zhou Lianfang for illicit sexual relations, each to three months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. The appeal period has long passed, and the case is final. Therefore, Yin Junong recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Chen Zonghui and his father, Chen Weiquan, for divorce, custody, and the return of her dowry. The claim is divided into three parts: (1) to approve the divorce of Chen Zonghui and Yin Junong; (2) the two daughters, Qiulai and Meimei, to be under the</p>
<p>plaintiff's custody;</p>
<p>(3) to return the dowry and all clothing. If they cannot be returned, the two defendants should jointly compensate 20,870.08 yuan in national currency. As for the alimony, the original intention was to request a payment of 126,000 yuan, but due to lack of funds for the litigation, the request was reserved. The court accepted the case, and Judge Li Liang opened Civil Court 7 yesterday morning to hear the case. The two defendants appointed lawyers to represent them in court and filed a counterclaim, requesting that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed and that Qiulai and Meimei be under Chen Zonghui's custody. The court verified the arguments, and because the two parties were not present, it ordered a rescheduling for the morning of the 19th for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Bank Shanghai Branch Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, which had temporarily suspended operations due to financial difficulties, has now hired Ding Shangui as manager and Qian Jiazhen as deputy manager, and is working with the original deputy manager, Zhu Kaiguan, to sort out receipts and payments and adjust personnel. It has now been sorted out and is scheduled to resume operations on the 14th of this month. At that time, depositors of the bank, whether current or term deposits, can withdraw their money at any time. This method has been decided by Manager Ding and has been notified to the Shanghai Municipal Bankers' Association and the Shanghai Bankers' Association.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Encounters Robbery, Kills a Thief; Deceased Thief Had Been Sentenced Eight Times</h3>
<p>At 8:30 yesterday morning, an old woman from Ningbo, Wang Zhou氏, was riding in a rickshaw when three robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside as she passed the entrance of the Slaughterhouse Company at the intersection of Mintini Yin Road and Pi Shaonai Road. They stopped the rickshaw, and one robber used a gun to threaten her. They robbed the old woman of a gold ring on her hand (valued at more than 100 yuan) and fled together. Yang immediately shouted "Catch the thieves!" At that time, a Russian police officer No. 25 from the French police station happened to pass by and bravely chased after them. When he was about to catch up, one of the thieves tried to open fire to resist arrest. The Russian police officer immediately fired seven shots in succession, hitting the thief in the head, who fell to the ground and died. The other two thieves took the opportunity to escape into Alley 287 on Pi Shaonai Road and disappeared without a trace. The body of the deceased thief was taken to the coroner's office by the police station. According to the fingerprint department of the French police station, the deceased thief was named Jiang Jinfu, thirty-six years old this year, a well-known rogue in the district who had been sentenced to imprisonment eight times.</p>
<p>At approximately 0:45 PM yesterday, two robbers broke into No. 132, Aiwenyi Road. One of them was armed with a pistol and threatened them not to make a sound. They were robbed of 609 yuan in national currency, six silver coins, and a check for 1,900 yuan.</p>
<p>At approximately 9:30 AM yesterday, two bandits came to No. 620, Dexing Road, Peng Road, Hongkou. They were armed with weapons, resulting in the robbery of clothing worth 140 yuan in legal currency.</p>

The bodies were handed over to their families for burial.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Police Shooting on Singapore Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 4:00 PM yesterday, several robbers broke into a certain number at No. 255, Singapore Road, Huxi, to commit robbery. Japanese military police learned of this and, together with detectives, went to arrest them. The robbers opened fire on the police upon their arrival. The detectives and Japanese military police also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides fired many shots, resulting in one Japanese military police officer being injured. Two robbers were apprehended. Wang Difang, 29 years old, from Yancheng, who lived at No. 47, Singapore Road, was passing by the area and was hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet, falling to the ground and bleeding profusely. She was transported to a nearby hospital by Chinese police and then transferred to Baolong Hospital for treatment due to the severity of her injuries.

<h3>Where are Women Going? (1) Women Should Return to the Home</h3>
<p>— Qizhai</p>
<p>(II) Women and Psychology: In addition to the "special ability to give birth," women also have a "special ability for motherly love" psychologically. Like the "special ability to give birth," this is a kind of "racial instinct." If women did not have the "special ability for motherly love," mankind could not grow up and would become extinct. Women are impelled by the "special ability for motherly love" and naturally wish to give up everything and sacrifice everything to be the protectors of their children. Therefore, Dr. Wang Wanbai once called "Mothers are the first-class nurses in the world." This is a unique need of women's instincts, like drinking, eating, and sex, that cannot be stopped. Hollingworth and Poffenberger believe that "one of the most cruel punishments in life is solitary confinement." I dare say: "One of the most cruel punishments for women is not allowing women to love their children."</p>
<p>(III) Women and Society: Society is a group of people, and the unit of the group is the individual. Women are the people who produce many individuals who become a group, so women are the "mother of society." Since the unit of society is the individual, the good or bad of society depends entirely on the good or bad of the individual. If the "mother of society" cannot obtain a reasonable environment (an environment that meets the physiological and psychological needs of women), it will definitely affect the health and intelligence of children, and society will not be good.</p>
<h3>Women Should Go to Society</h3>
<p>— Yi Hui</p>
<p>(II) Women and Psychology: There are no parents in the world who do not love their children. But many people think that loving children is a special ability of mothers. In fact, the reason why mothers seem to be especially protective of their children is mostly because mothers have more contact with their children than fathers do. Similarly, a mother loves her two biological children whom she cares for herself more than those cared for by a nanny. From a psychological point of view, every woman has her own different personality and strengths. We cannot assume that all mothers are good at raising children. A child's growth cannot rely solely on motherly love. Reasonable educational methods are just as important as motherly love. Moreover, women who are employed can still love their children. In the advanced countries that are most committed to the construction of nurseries, many places are posted with a slogan: "Nothing can replace a mother's milk and a mother's love!" The children in nurseries are not children in orphanages. After their parents finish their day's work, they can all go back to enjoy family happiness and parental love as much as possible. Who says that employed women cannot love their children?</p>
<p>(III) Women and Society: The good or bad of individuals can affect society. The good or bad of society can also affect individuals. Therefore, on the one hand, women must use excellent education to make children play a good role in society. On the other hand, she must also work hard to directly transform society, because a progressive society can have a good influence on children, and a dark society can also make children degenerate. As Mr. Wu said, society is composed of groups. But we must also remember that women themselves are part of the group. They account for half of the crowd. Their contribution to society is by no means merely indirect. They are the indispensable direct force to promote social progress.</p>

<h3>Younger Brother's Dream</h3>
<p>— Liusha</p>
<p>Free Talk once published an article entitled "My Younger Brother." I was extremely moved by the progress of his younger brother's life. I couldn't help but start writing because I thought of my own younger brother. But to my shame, my younger brother is neither as smart nor as progressive as that younger brother. Moreover, he is a stupid young man with a lot of vanity and a strong spirit of Ah Q. I didn't want to expose him because it's a very undignified thing for me. However, reading Lei Xingjun's warning: "We hate the darkness, but we are not afraid of the darkness." made me feel that the regressive and harmful trend needs to be severely punished and constantly attacked. Therefore, my nonsense may be of some practical benefit to readers.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let me introduce my younger brother!</p>
<p>He is a middle school student, not very good at learning, and his physique is not very healthy either. However, he is very proud and loves to show off in public.</p>
<p>There was a time when he spent almost half the day admiring his own appearance. He once boasted that his face and hair not only closely resembled the movie star Mei Xi, but also somewhat resembled the literary hero Yu Dafu. His joy exceeded his age, but I could only secretly pity his naivety and frivolity.</p>
<p>He has great hopes, but they are just dreams. He has great ambitions, but his abilities and skills are pitifully low. He has dreamed of a happy heaven, fame, money, career, promotion… But the vicious reality shattered his sweet dreams and could not fulfill his wishes. But he kept dreaming. He often said: I have to work hard in the future, starting tomorrow. But he has never suffered, and he has never struggled resolutely.</p>
<p>His main flaw! is that he only has fantasies and never touches reality. We must recognize that in the process of the birth of a new China, this spirit will inevitably decline and be eliminated. The most tragic thing is that he is not alone. He represents the characteristics of a group of petty bourgeoisie and the typical spirit of Ah Q; and he is the direct blood and veins of most urban students. If he can be unbiased and open his eyes to face reality, he will not think that I am overstating it. This should be regarded as a serious problem, belonging to the mental illness aspect of society, worthy of attention and discussion by scholars.</p>
<p>How should we save this group of young people?</p>

<h3>We Are Still Young</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>We are still young.</p>
<p>We are the crystallization of light, heat, and power. The fire of youth is burning in our hearts!</p>
<p>We sing praises, sing praises of freedom and justice. We must sing praises of the truth, the eternal and unchanging absolute truth!</p>
<p>We also criticize. We raise the gun of liberation, aiming at all the ugliness, violence, and shamelessness in the world…, and declare their death sentence in an instant!</p>
<p>We are singers of the universe. Also sharpshooters.</p>
<p>The progress of history is curvilinear and upward. Occasional storms and temporary darkness cannot make us depressed, decadent, or disappear.</p>
<p>Plants grow tortuously under the stones. We are the brave petrels in the storm! The patience of a camel, the ferocity of a lion, the agility of a monkey!…</p>
<p>Not the obedience of a sheep, the greed of a jackal, the carefulness of a bat!…</p>
<p>For ourselves, for the motherland, and for mankind!</p>
<p>We are still young.</p>
<h3>Dance of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ding Du Zuo</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>Where the Dancing Queen Ends Up</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Ten The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said to us: "Song Quan is currently in the West District Police Station. This news is very brief, and I don't know the details. Mr. Hawthorne, can you come with me to the police station to ask what's going on?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne pondered for a moment before saying, "I think I'll go back. If there's any news, let me know. I'm concerned about Hesheng."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Okay, then I'll go back to the station first. As soon as I get news about Hesheng, I'll tell you." After saying that, he jumped into a rickshaw nearby.</p>
<p>When Hawthorne and I returned to No. 77, Aiwen Road, it was getting dark, and the street lights were on. As soon as we entered the office, Shi Gui handed Hawthorne a letter. Hawthorne took off his hat and coat and opened the letter under the electric light on his desk. I also leaned over to look. It was sent by Lu Jiansheng, and a check for 1,000 yuan was attached to the letter. Although the letter was only a few sentences, the wording was very humble.</p>
<p>The letter said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hawthorne: Lilan died tragically. I feel very guilty. I am grateful that you are responsible for the investigation. I have already answered everything you asked this morning with sincerity. I sincerely hope that you will understand my humble feelings. If the real culprit can be brought to justice and the grievances of the deceased can be slightly cleared, I will be grateful for your great kindness. Attached is a small gift, which is not worth much. I will visit again to thank you in the near future. Sincerely, Lu Jiansheng, on this day" Hawthorne threw the letter on the desk at random, with a slight contemptuous smile on the corner of his mouth. He leaned back in the swivel chair, stretched, but did not express any opinion.</p>
<p>I smiled and said, "You don't need to pay for Ah Gen's expenses out of your own pocket anymore." (169)</p>

<h3>Napoleon's Invasion of Italy</h3>
<p>— Bitter Li</p>
<p>The greatness of music is universally acknowledged. It not only cultivates temperament but can even cure illnesses. Having just read the article "Memories of the Occupation of Oslo," I couldn't help but recall an old story about Napoleon's invasion of Italy. I remember a story in Feng Zikai's translation of "Children's Music" that shows the profound relationship between the power of music and military affairs.</p>
<p>Speaking of Napoleon, most people think of him as just a war expert, but it wasn't quite like that. When going to battle, he often ordered his soldiers, saying what kind of music was not allowed and what kind should be played loudly. So, Napoleon often chose the military music himself. When the enemy attacked, he specifically ordered his soldiers to play music loudly.</p>
<p>In 1797, he was about to cross the treacherous Alps and invade Italy. It is said that only two people in ancient times had invaded Italy: one was Hannibal, the great general of Carthage on the North African coast, 2,000 years ago; the other was Napoleon.</p>
<p>He had to cross snow-covered cliffs and precipices. Napoleon's troops were originally strong and brave, but when they reached really dangerous places, they couldn't move forward. Seeing this situation, Napoleon immediately chose lively music and ordered the musicians to play. The soldiers, hearing this interesting music, became a hundred times more courageous and finally were able to cross these dangerous mountains and attack Italy.</p>
<h3>"The Compassionate Doctor"</h3>
<p>— Wangsun of Chu Water</p>
<p>Is a movie about a doctor, starring "Louis Calhern" and "Lana Turner," produced by "MGM," and showing at the "Dahua" cinema.</p>
<p>It tells the audience:</p>
<p>"Dr. Gillespie," a famous diagnostician at New York's Central Hospital, is a crippled doctor with a bad temper; everyone is afraid of him. Only a young doctor, "Dr. Kildare," is willing to get close to him, and he also believes that "Kildare" can be his "successor." Once, "Kildare" misdiagnosed a patient. "Gillespie" knew this was entirely due to lack of experience, so he sent "Kildare" to serve in a poor people's clinic, and sent a girl "Manny" along to report on his service status at any time. He served very well. One day, "Nick," who was mistakenly injured, asked him for treatment. He removed the bullet and treated him wholeheartedly. "Nick's" sister, "Rosalie," is very beautiful, and "Kildare" falls in love with her. Based on "Manny's" report, "Gillespie" knew that he was secretly treating "Nick," who may have committed a crime, so he advised him not to and to hand him over to the police immediately, otherwise the doctor's position would be revoked by the government. He refused. Later, he was tricked into going home. After he returned to New York to treat "Nick," "Nick" was arrested by the police, and he was also fired from the hospital. He believed that Nick was not a criminal, but he could not find the real culprit to clear his name. From "Nick's" mouth, he learned that a gangster was involved in the crime, so he tried to catch him and hand him over to the police. "Gillespie" was very happy to hear this news, because from then on "Kildare" could resume his "old life." He also knew that "Kildare" was obsessed with "Rosalie," so he visited this girl himself, only to find out that she did not love him. Just then, "Kildare" came to see her, and he suddenly realized something. He left "Rosalie," returned to his position as "Gillespie's" assistant, and immersed himself in the affection of his companion girl "Manny," immersed himself in sacred work.</p>
<p>I think the performance of "Lionel Barrymore" as "Gillespie" is better. The demeanor of that kind of doctor is very experienced and vivid! Especially in expressing "irascibility," the loud shouts and small movements are "pure perfection" everywhere. "Lana Turner's" "Rosalie" and "Laraine Day's" "Manny" are both appropriate. On the contrary, "Louis Calhern," who played "Kildare," did not achieve anything special, although he did not "fail his duty"!</p>
<p>What we should pay the most attention to is the technique of the director "Harold, S. Bucquet." Although it is extremely small and trivial actions, he never relaxes casually. He always puts in a lot of thought. After watching it, we feel light, vivid, and lively. We can imagine that "dozing off" during directing is absolutely impossible.</p>
<h3>"The Tragedy of Miss Lan"</h3>
<p>Yesterday I went to the Qingyun Drama Society to watch the rehearsal of "The Tragedy of Miss Lan," and the results were very good. The role of Miss Lan is played by Miss Zhuang Zhong. It is said that since the first dialogue, she seems to have been obsessed with finding reference materials, studying and researching. Now it is almost the New Year, but she is still working hard with dissatisfaction. Indeed, her success is not accidental. Her acting skills have two advantages: (1) The control of breathing is very natural. (2) The dividing line between the expression of emotions is very clear. Especially in the third act, the blank expression when she killed Dick was truly profound. At the end, Miss Lan cried out miserably. The sound of crying was like a sharp knife piercing my heart, moving me to tears. Director Jiang Jingjun humbly asked me for criticism. In fact, what else can I say besides celebrating the future of the amateur theater troupe?</p>
<p>I heard that they have scheduled an experimental performance at the Lafayette Theater at 10:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
