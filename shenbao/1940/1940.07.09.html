<h3 id="c10">美總統闡述的門羅主義 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>國際局勢正向變質變形種種方面遽急的演進。莫說如此演進果將如何歸宿，殆爲目前最優勢的幾種勢力所不能把握；即以目前局勢而論，殆亦爲造成這局勢的幾種勢力者所不及料。</p>
<p>假使放任局勢的儘量幻變，放任他自然演進，則除了伊於胡底的慨歎與疑問之外，無法逆覩其前途，預言其終極。所得逆覩者：各竭全力，繼續作戰而已；戰之後，勝利者持續其支配者的姿態，屈服者偷偷摸摸的掙扎，幸在漩渦之外者亦惴惴不能自安，於是而三者更復各竭全力，競爭軍備，準備再戰而已。爭强，爭勝。謀控制，圖報復，行見永無安定，尤無所謂終極。拿破崙大帝豈沒有智慧來接受一千七百多年的歷史敎訓，終被放逐；由俄普奧三國的「神聖宣言」乃至蛻化爲俄普奧英的四國同盟，以絕對權威的聯合來宰制歐洲，終於解體；凡爾賽和約結束了上次歐戰，但引起了這一次砲火而化爲灰燼，想當年，誰不想創爲一成不變之局？期望他一成不變的，猶且變之不已，何况目前正向着劇變而急進！</p>
<p>美國身居局外，殆不願坐視國際局勢橫衝直撞的演變吧！這不是美總統羅斯福氏前日授權於秘書歐萊氏重新闡述門羅主義的動機嗎？這次闡述，牽涉了歐亞兩洲，針對着目前演變。其要旨略謂：『德國如要求法英荷在西半球所有之領土，則美國不擬作接收此項領土之努力，但將邀請美洲各國決定，應吾將此領土置於代管制度下，直至可交還原主爲止」。原來美國的門羅主義，發表於一八二三年；當時歐洲的『神聖同盟』想發揮其君權神權，干涉美國新產生的許多獨立自由的國家；於是美國總統門羅氏發此宣言，反對歐洲各國對於美洲新國，以各種藉口或各種方式，來控制這些新國家的運命。所以這次羅斯福氏所命闡述的，猶是當年本意，但是，不止如此；他牽涉了歐亞，並且對此極度動盪的變局，作了殆有積極性建設性的暗示：故又有云：『總統聲明美國毫無干涉與歐洲或亞洲調整有關的土地問題之意。美國政府所欲見者，亦所認爲應有者，即歐亞門羅主義的實施，與西半球對於此主義之解釋與實施相吻合而已；試舉例言之，關於法屬安南事，美國以爲亞洲全體各國應會商而獲一決定。歐亞爭執由歐亞諸國自解決之。屬於德國所征服諸國之諸島嶼與其他領土，在西半球之內者，其處置與管理問題，則由美洲諸國解決之』。</p>
<p>對此具有深長意義的宣示，我們深憾於不獲知之更詳確，更具體。即就上文所引而論，我們當然不願加以故意的誤解或惡意的曲解，但願電傳之無訛，則不能不解釋爲下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）歐戰諸國在美洲的領土問題，須由美洲各國來會商辦法，亦即未便聽由戰勝者決定之；</p>
<p>（二）承認各交戰國在歐亞二洲的領土，有變更餘地；</p>
<p>（三）歐亞二洲的領土變更，須由各洲全體國家會商辦法。未便聽由戰勝者決定之；</p>
<p>（四）有關一洲以上者須由有關各洲的全體國家商決之；</p>
<p>（五）對於歐洲的所謂門羅主義，以及亞洲的所謂門羅主義，未始不可承認，但須一如美洲門羅主義的本來面目；即尊重各洲各國的獨立自由，不容他國控制其運命。</p>

<p>青年當前切迫之務；　一·認識時代；二·堅守主義信仰；三確立革命人生觀·</p>
<p>重慶　三民主義靑年團成立二週年紀念、蔣團長特發表告全國靑年書、略謂、</p>
<p>我國抗戰已逾三年、往者中正爲集中國民革命之新生力量、以策抗戰建國之成功、特創設三民主義靑年團、自成立迄今、亦已二週年矣、我全國靑年、在艱危顚困之環境中、各盡其能、奮發努力、爲被難同胞盡力救濟、爲受傷官兵自動看護、爲黨國效忠、爲社會服務、爲健全自身而學習、皆已經歷非常之陶鑄與磨練、其發育滋長、較之往昔、已獲充實之進步、但</p>
<p>檢討過去審度現勢、國家民族所需要於我靑年之努力者、與日俱增、而我靑年平日精勤進修期圖自效者、猶爲未足、其於抗戰建國工作之進行、實亦未能發揮其全力、克盡其職食、甚至有不勝環境之艱困、因而徘徊煩悶、以致悲觀消沉者、此其影響於民族前途、與革命成敗之鉅大、何可勝言、蓋今日</p>
<p>全國青年皆爲我民族偉大文化之繼承人、皆爲我國家光明前途之創造者、革命建國之重任、均在吾靑年之肩頭、是以中正對吾靑年、實認爲一切志業一切責任所寄託、以完成繼起的新生命、中正期望我靑年之切、奚啻家人之視其子弟、今當抗戰已逾三年、我靑年團成立二週年紀念日、又臨此國家最後勝利之重要關頭、對於目前靑年應有之</p>
<p>基本認識與眞實之努力、不得不剴切精誠爲我全國靑年明告之、夫人生之所以可貴、卽在對前途有瞻望、對行爲有意志、而對生活有理想、此爲人類之特性、而在靑年時期爲尤然、吾人所生之時代、爲何如之時代、在此時代中、吾人將何所作爲、何所表現、何所成就、始能饜足自身之所望、達成理想之人生、此任何靑年共同所具之感覺與應有之認識也、靑年一身之成敗、均視其認定如何、乃爲</p>
<p>理想人生此認識而正確堅守、則心安氣壯、必能往直前、此諷識而不獲解答、或惟有認識而不正確、不堅定、則徬徨煩悶、爲必至之結果、今日靑年何以有徬徨煩悶之現象、實由於未能眞切認識其時代與環境、因而未能適當考慮其責任與前途、所謂適當之考慮者、吾以爲首先應認淸吾人所託生之國家、與個人對國家之關係、居中國今日而論、必先求得</p>
<p>國家獨立與民族之解放、而後乃有個人眞正的理想人生之可言、如何求得國家之獨立與民族之解放、此爲國民革命如何成功之問題、而國民革命之成敗、端在其革命主義之是否實現、如此主義而偉大正確完備、且適合於革命之環境、則主義必實現、革命必成功、若此主義不適合於中國革命之時代與環境、則決不能實現、主義失敗、而革命亦無不失敗、是以今日靑年、誠欲實現其理想的人生、只須</p>
<p>認識時代與國家環境、認識革命主義、確定革命思想、認淸途徑、全力以赴、則一切煩悶、立可打破、人生意義、灼然不惑、決無徘徊迷惑之苦痛矣、以上所言、可知吾靑年欲打破心理上之徘徊與沉悶、切實擔負歷史與時代之使命其最迫切之急務、無過於（一）認識時代（二）堅守主義信仰、（三）確立革命的人生觀、以言中國現在之時代、自我神聖抗戰發動以來、吾人已臨我中華民族五千年歷史文化存亡絕續之關頭、亦卽我炎黃子孫起死回生、</p>
<p>轉弱爲強開拓未來無限光明之樞紐、日人挾其四十餘年積累儲備之陸海空軍、對我中國爲孤注一擲、而我以劣勢之軍備、苦戰三年、屹立不動、且我國勝利之基礎日固、此種堅苦卓絕之戰鬥、與由此而生之</p>
<p>重大成就請如政治經濟之革新、社會文化之發揚、與時代環境之改造、非惟中國歷史上之所僅見、抑且開世界歷史上之新紀元、其自第三國人士之觀察、或後世民族子孫回溯此一段驚天動地之歷史、對於我中華民族現階段之光榮偉大、眞不知其如何景仰、我靑年何幸而生於此歷史上最偉大之時期、自決不可辜負此</p>
<p>千載難得之機會、誠能發揮其革命精神、用之於革命救國之奮鬥、則其事業成就、直將前無古人、後無來者、國家之獨立、與民族之解放、必以吾人之汁血求得之、由此創造吾人眞正之人生、亦爲後乎吾人之靑年、開拓無窮之生命、生此時代、丁此國運、決不可自暴自棄、而應把握時代、對民族負起繼往開來之職責、人人貢獻其智能、努力於本務、發揮其生命之光榮、克盡其革命之責任與義務、此卽吾人所以</p>
<p>積極自效與破除徘徊沉悶之第一要義、以言堅定之主義信仰、現在世界各國所揭　之主義、最主要者、不外法西斯主義·共產主義·與民主主義而已、所謂民主主義者、爲資本主義國家之產物、歷年環境、已經變遷、決不能如三民主義之民生主義之澈底、與民權問題以眞實圓滿的解決、共產主義偏重經濟、且其理論出發於一個階級之利益、亦不能對整個民生問題爲完善合理之解決、至於法西斯主義、只注重自已民族之利益、而忽視其他民族之利益、更非吾人理想進步之民族主義所可比擬、凡此皆偏而不全、各有缺點、惟我總理所手創之</p>
<p>三民主義則不然、發之於至諒、行之於至公、以民生哲學博愛濟衆爲原理、以世界大同互助共享爲目的、內容完備具體可行、足以解決今日世界所有之民族民權民生三大問題、而毫無偏頗不全本末顚倒之弊、總理對於實行民族主義之要諦曰、（必先實行民族主義、然後才配得上談世界主義）、其發揮民生主義之要諦曰、（人人應以服務爲目的、而不以奪取爲目的）、可知我三民主義以與西洋各國以私人資本（佔有慾）來刺激生產、或以（唯物史觀）和（社會革命）的方法相比較、眞有</p>
<p>天淵之別且三民主義以情理法三者爲基礎、故於人類生存與進化、皆能有最適宜之調整、抑自各種主義立論之基礎而言、西洋各國哲學之基礎、不免偏重於名物、惟我三民主義之民生哲學、能精神與物質並存、至於革命力量、則尤重精神力量之發揮、總理嘗云、（革命力量九分精神、一分物質）因我有此一貫之</p>
<p>革命哲學作基礎、故革命所憑藉之物質雖缺乏、而革命精神愈能發揮卽愈能持久、觀乎我抗戰三年之中、世界情勢之變化、眞令人有驚奇莫測之感、歐洲少數國家、今已不復能如往昔之自由存在、或僅數月而覆滅、甚或數日而敗亡、此其原因、卽由於無共信共行之最適當的主義、以爲立事基礎、遂以造成精神之動搖與消失、而我國今日之所以能愈戰愈堅屹立不動者、除我廣地民衆之外、實由於我三民主義力量之偉大、使我中國靑年人人能</p>
<p>眞切認識唯三民主義之最適合於中國革命之　境、人人堅定其對於三民主義之信仰、切實遵奉爲革命行動之準則、一德一心、共求貫澈、則中國之革命、必不致於失敗、卽有一時之進退或頓挫、而主義信仰、普遍深入於中國之人心、國民革命終必有成功之一日、與堅定主義信仰有聯帶之關係者、則爲確立革命的人生覜、明白言之、卽在認識人生之眞諦而已、吾人何爲而生、旣生於現在之時代與世界、對於國家民族與世界人類、負有何種之責任、吾人更何爲而革命、更應如何努力、始能成功、</p>
<p>革命事業總之、吾人應立志爲何等人物、始足以上對祖宗父母、下對世代子孫、卽吾所謂眞正的理想人生、可以導引吾人於最大之成功者、革命人生觀之確立不外認識其個人對於宇宙所處之地位與羣已關係之分際而已、以個人對字宙而言、中正嘗謂、宇宙是無窮大的空間與無限長的時間之結構、而我們個人的生命、却渺小如滄海之一粟、短促如曇花之一現、然而無窮大的空間、却是我們的舞台、無限長的時間、却是我們的旅程、</p>
<p>宇宙萬物是爲我們而生、待我們而用「所以我們就是宇宙的主宰、我們要征服自然、利用萬物、來增益人類的生活、以羣己關係之分際而言、中正又嘗謂、生活的目的、在增進人類全體之生活、生命的意義、在創造宇宙繼起之生命、由前之　、吾靑年必鍛練其體魄、增益其智能、以達吾人征服自然利用萬物之目的、由後之義、吾靑年尤必須打破個人</p>
<p>生死關頭袪除自私自利利之心理　知今日中國之靑年、其生也爲國家民族之獨立自由而生、爲全國同胞之生存幸福而生、其死也亦必爲國家民族之獨立自由與全國同胞之生存幸福而死、能明瞭人生之眞諦、則向此努力、往前奮鬥、創迭進取之未可、復何徊徘沉悶之有然、而吾靑年對於時代、對於主義與人生、僅有明確之認識、尙爲未足也、若不講求力行貫澈之道、以求實現人生理想、與我革命之主義、則一切問題、仍無法解決、如此、雖有認識而小澈底、仍必無繼於實際、今日</p>
<p>多數青年終未能充分發揮其彌滿豐富之生命力量以盡應有之貢獻、因而不獲超脫徊徘沉悶之境界者、卽由其對於革命主義思想與理論及時代特徵、雖具相當之了解、而無力行之至誠與勇氣、不知實行之途徑、更缺乏篤實踐履之精神、只知坐而言、不能起而行、遂致形成今日空疏浮泛徊徘停滯之現象、不唯爲社會所詬病、亦且於革命爲損失、今後靑年所應一致覺醒自求振拔者、端在如何實行其確認之主義、以完成理想之人生、此卽須有</p>
<p>獨立自強之精神、與奮鬥創造之能力、旣不可苟安自逸、甘爲坐食成果、倚賴他力之落伍分子、更不可隨世俯仰、與俗浮沉、對於現實無眞實確立之見解、徒爲浮薄膚淺之宣傳所煽惑、以自陷於迷惑失次與沉悶徬徨、夫以現在時代之千載難得、與三民主義之精深博大、吾靑年苟能篤信力行、豈患無實行主義報國救世之機會、然使吾靑年不能保有自尊獨立之精神、或因不耐經濟上生活上之困苦、遂致</p>
<p>怨天尤人、對於環境、懷種種怨思與偏見、或爲膚淺錯誤之宣傳所誘惑、而動搖其意志、改變其初衷、精神上一旦失所維緊、則行動亦必立陷於沉迷、我中國往古聖人以（博學）（審問）（愼思）（明辨）（篤行）訓人、其要義卽在於人人能下省察之工夫、自期甚厚、自責至嚴、不斷　免以完成其健全之人格、吾青年一生事業成敗之關鍵在此、吾人能吾成爲</p>
<p>頂天立地之大人物、根本亦卽在此、尤須警惕者、則爲現在靑年徘徊消沉之結果、往往放棄本身之基本工作、對於應盡之義務與本職、每多怠忽而不知自强、此爲靑年最大之缺點、應知吾靑年立志在作革命大事，亦卽救人救世之事，而救人救世、卽須置身最下層之社會、接近最痛苦之同胞、以改善社會環境解除同胞痛苦、然後革命大事、方有成功之一日、若捩此基本之工作、而以名利地位是尙、則不僅個人慾望不能滿足、抑且與吾人革命之人生觀完全相反、須知吾人從事革命、必先有貢獻、然後能有成就、必先有犧牲、然後能</p>
<p>取得代價、所謂犧牲貢獻云者、卽總理所謂大家要希望革命成功、便先要犧牲個人的自由、個人的平等、把各人的自由平等、都貢獻到革命黨內來、凡是黨內的紀律、大家都要遵守、黨內的命令、大家都要服從、全黨運動一致進行、只有全黨有自由、個人不能自由、然後我們的革命、才可以有成功、此誠我靑年從事革命之寳訓、亦卽革命成功唯一之途徑、</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）初以外滙報緊、且人心異常堅挺、買戶擁擠、錢兌業金號均有吃胃、致開市於買風下、在抬一百〇五元、銀號出金號五十兩、爲五千一百五十元、繼因價開過高、引起多方拋出、且進者轉少、未幾卽回落六十元、銀號出金號十兩、退爲五千〇九十元、旋乃證券幫忽起買意、而售者减少、復拉提四十元、證券幫進銀號十兩、爲五千一百三十元、第因某錢兌業突來傾吐、且斯時津幫暗中亦賣、重見回小七十元、銀號對做十兩、最低價爲五千〇六十元、此後銀號幫乘低頻撈、而港幫從中活動、再又飛升八十元、銀號對做二十兩、高至五千一百四十元、午刻買風稍戢、略形回降、錢兌業出銀號十兩、退爲五千一百十五元作午收價、午後開市稍高、首由金號出銀號十兩、爲五千一百二十元、嗣證券幫錢兌業吸收又高二十元、銀樓業互做十兩、爲五千一百四十元、後以另一證券幫前來吐賣、不久某金號絡續塞出、且某錢莊代津幫亦售、逐回低三十五元、銀號出金號二十兩、爲五千一百〇五元、不意此後市勢重堅、錢兌業證券幫及銀號等紛來競買、同時某金號亦反出爲進、且因外滙告緊、售者不多、價卽飛躍八十五元、錢兌業出金號二十兩、爲五千一百九十元、昨晚收價、結果比上週六回漲一百四十五元、乃連跌四天共小三百八十五元後之反動也、收後趨勢尤挺、五千二百十五元曾有成交、最後五千二百〇五元、則有賣戶、全天一百三十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金連升二十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百二十元、迨九時半掛高十元、午後三時二十分續大十元、計大向行改懸五百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、牧進减低三元光景、</p>

<p>昨日上午米市初開、賣買雙方仍在觀望、且以今日將實施評價、致作客方面更抱穩健主義、迄中市除本鄕店胃爲應急需略事添購外、餘則均鮮問津、售方見銷塲旣衰、而大批洋米絡續湧到、視夫大勢又覺居高臨危、搖搖欲墮、心思益虛、頃刻各色洋米行情、猶如決堤在瀾、一路直瀉、結果收盤、除中高檔各貨、尙幸店銷動動、較週前見貶一元至元半、計一號陳西貢爲六十五元、二號六十三元、六十二元半、一號暹羅六十五元、二號六十二元半、火絞六十四元、六十三元半、香港尖六十三元、六十二元半、小絞六十二元、六十一元八角、他若各色下身貨、旣因內地去路停頓、又以本埠不日　施平糶、衰頽尤甚、竟暴瀉二三元之巨、其東京砶尖最低價已祗五十八九元、紅米五十七八元、碎尖高自五十一元二角、次至四十七元、栖四十五六元、米菉五十三元左右、洋米因前訂上月十八日裝之暹邏、業已抵埠、故人心稍餒、市面山緊轉疲、晨開英華司卽交暹邏二號米價爲七十六元、嗣降至七十五元七角半至七角、迨收市爲七十五元、又廿號裝價爲七十三元半至三元、又二十六號裝價爲七十二元二角至七十二元、比前悉降元餘、計成交七百七十五噸、又現貨做開六千餘包、價亦見跌元許、</p>
<p>洋米昨又有到滬、太古公司岳州輪自香港裝來三千三百五十九包、昨晨抵埠、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、聞怡和洋行裕生輪亦由香港運來一萬五千餘包、原定昨日下午到滬、因海面　風、改今晨進口、（祖）</p>
<p>糯米昨猛漲三四元之鉅、蓋以貨斷旣久、棧存銳减、銷塲物稀爲貴、作客殆恐向隅、一時形成供不敷求、造成有意想不到之貴價、開金溧特元七十元、常丹白元六十九元、次六十八元、江北次元六十六七元、香港糯七十元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米續到一千四五百包、傳聞塲外嗜盤、因受洋米影響形勢並亦帶軟、不過售價尙無榮辱、常帮特淸粳仍須七十四元七八角、常州蘇崑白粳七十二三元、次至宿七十元、靑泗薄稻七十二三元、南港早稻特自七十一元、次至宿六十九元、斛見六十七八元云云、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市步挺、蓋因華紛廠供給仍祇阜豐廠維持本街、每日不過五六千包、本客之需要者、當然供不敷求、惟有仰給於日廠及內地之雜牌粉、近日內地來源不絕、去路頗活、昨市開出金山牌十六元五角、鳳凰牌十六元三角、强生粉十六元四角半，又七八月份綠鳳凰價開十六元四角二分、內地金由牌粉較上週又漲一角、鳳凰牌反見鬆動、成交約有一萬餘包、老車牌廠盤仍維十五元二角之原價、老車回籠粉並無正市、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市仍乏正式開展、惟日商方面、聞有車船麥辦進近萬包、價二十三元至二十四元、華廠方面、間有零星小數運到、迄無大額可收、而糧商所傳本週搬運許可證頒發消息、亦尙無切實辦法、又聞日廠亦定美麥一船之消息、亦未能證實、而華廠方面、則確有澳麥接洽、繼續訂購中、</p>

<p>紗市平靜、趨勢安定、至於實際交易、華南方面、運輸又可通航、所以港幫對於粗細紗採辦較昔爲活絡、人心重振、浙東方面、亦購買不斷、故環境雖惡劣、市面益覺寗謐、然新買者亦寥寥無幾、因此情况、尙在擯持中、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、塲內人氣和平、又為開小盤、二十支雙馬價爲九百十元、旋聞外匯無甚變化、而廣幫現銷雖無大量需要、然零星交易尙堪維持、市况徐徐上升、漲至九百二十三元、收盤稍形回挫、查半日間成交統計一千九百八十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌二元、上日申新二廠開出二十支天女七百包、價爲九百三十元、統一廠開出二三支金鷄六百包、價爲一千元、均係同行進、昨有棉紗五十件、今日又有九十五件、均運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉交易、仍在靜寂之境、不過日廠方面、稍有需要、然市價平平、華廠態度依然渙散、通州花價一百五十四元、同行進九十五包、印度棉一百八十元、同行進六百件、均現貨棧交、生意略爲活動、不像昔日之呆滯矣、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初先因南方套賣而略跌、後因現貨商之購買及一部份之空頭抵補及現貨商之賣出近期掉進遠期、結果收盤價格近期降落十磅音、遠期反見漲起八九磅音、印度市况堅定、昨日連同預測猛漲十羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來已漸見活躍、日廠稍有進胃、惟交易數額不巨、俱爲放銀期之交易、數日來竟有四五千包之成交額、然華廠交易仍然靜寂異常、按照目前情况、外棉已入轉機狀態矣、</p>

<p>布市平平、實銷成交尙盛各布廠以現市不敷成本、多數已暫停工作、以後產量、自將銳减、是以人心已稍穩定、同業及染廠乘廉、頗有搜購、各貨開價、較之週前、均少軒輊、一小部份布價、續跌每疋二角半之譜、本街成交粗布·坯布·漂染布一萬數千疋、甬溫台幫辦大鵬·富貴·細布·斜紋·色布·綫呢等貨近二百件、</p>

<p>港·越兩地、形勢異常緊張、香港中外居民、紛紛撤退、滬防航綫、一度斷航、卽華南廣州灣·海口及越南西貢·鴻基等處、航輪均皆停駛、近日因美國對於港越局勢、非常重視、並有反對日軍行動趨勢、因之兩地局勢、已稍見和緩、滬防綫航輪、昨有恢復之說、</p>
<p>各輪準備</p>
<p>復航怡和洋行裕生輪、已定十日自滬赴香港·海防、該輪原定昨日到滬，因颶風至晚未見進口、約今晨定可到埠、故駛防期或延至十一日、太古公司亦已派定瓊州輪、定十三日復航滬防綫、自滬赴香港、兼灣廣州灣·海口·至海防、滬防綫復航事、昨據兩公司云、雖已</p>
<p>派定船隻惟尙須待今日英海軍部准許後、始可正式發表、至上海赴鴻基裝煤之各輪、亦曾一度停駛、現已恢復、怡和洋行富陞貴生兩輪、昨已結關、定今晨出口直駛鴻基裝煤、又該行外洋部經理怡泰公司之M．U．CingalesePrince號、昨日自小呂宋來滬、定明日赴西貢、儎貨直駛舊金山、</p>
<p>赴港婦孺</p>
<p>華南班駛香港各輪、前曾禁售婦孺客票、蓋香港正在撤退婦孺、而前往香港之婦孺旅客、自應停搭、但自昨日起、太古怡和兩公司之所有駛往香港航輪、亦已恢復搭載婦孺、照常出售婦孺客票矣、</p>
<p>河鐵橋</p>
<p>老街通河口之巨型鐵橋、原為海防通滇省之唯一貨運樞紐、自法日恊定成立後、法方對該橋予以毀壤、致所有貨物全部停滯、滬上運輸機關、以西貢海防客車停開、故貨運完全停止收受、是以滬上運西南內地各貨、均改由寗波轉往、但據甫由海防來滬之乘客稱、啣接河口之老街鐵橋、復有正在修復之說、</p>
<p>滇緬通車</p>
<p>緬甸成爲中國唯一國際交通綫後、滇緬公路由昆明經大理騰衝至臘戍、已就原有驛道改造完成通車、滇緬鐵路經建築後卽將告成、該公路與鐵路至緬甸境後、有鐵路通仰光出海、由此往歐洲、較之由香港出口、縮短行程二千五百海浬、今滇緬公路之運輸日繁、除設有西南公路運輸管理局、辦理公路工程及運輸管理事項外、</p>
<p>辦理馱運</p>

<p>蔣澧泉談</p>
<p>第二特區地方法院推事蔣灃泉氏談稱、此次工部局因行政經費、收支不克平衡、自七月一日起增加市政捐及地稅、以求彌補、大房東及收支豐厚之二房東、竟亦乘機再事加租、在法律上租賃契約就租賃物所應納之一切稅捐、應由出租人負担、爲民法第四百二十七條所規定、不論爲定期或不定期契約、均屬相同、是此次所加之捐稅、應由房東負責、且租賃契約係屬雙務契約、其租金數額於訂定契約時、卽經約定、一經約定、嗣後非得對方同意、不得變更、</p>
<p>加租限制</p>
<p>至民法第四百四十二條所定、不動產租賃因其價値之昇降、當事人得聲請法院增减其租金云云、固限定不定期租賃而言、對於定期租賃、絕對不許加租、卽就上開法條言之、不定期租賃契約加租要件、亦須因不動產本身物價上昇、而由當事人聲請法院判決酌定、方得爲之、如果合於加租條件、亦需向法院請求，由法院依照上昇比例、判決酌定、尤不能逕由出租人以片面意見、通知加租、</p>
<p>片面加租</p>
<p>事實上常見有出租人、通知自某月某日加租若干、嗣後卽依照此數收取、如承租人不願增加、出租人或拒絕收受原額租金、或則逕以新加之數逐月作爲積欠、以爲後日終止租約之張本、此舉實屬錯誤、須知以積欠租金爲終止租約之理由者、須所欠之租金、係屬「約定」、出租人片面所定者、當非約定、且所謂積欠、須係故意拖欠、如承租人不願加租而照原額支付、致被拒絕者、係出租人暹延受領、承租人絕不負拖欠之責、</p>
<p>立法原旨</p>
<p>總之、我國現行民法、以社會為本位、一切權利義務須在社會之共同利益下、方許其自由行使、法官之裁判、亦以此爲合理的範圍、過去法界同人、巳於此盡相當之努力、阻遏大衆生活之日趨慘惡、上海市民、亦應瞻念民生、蒿目時艱、共體風雨同舟之責、同凛人類共存之義、勉自警惕、抑制私慾、是爲至盼、</p>

<p>本市民食調節協會、自於上月二十八日召開常務委會、修正訂購洋米辦法後、各方委託該會訂購者異常踴躍、據平明社記者訪悉、日來委託訂購者有人力車互助會·上海時疫醫院·等團體、預料首批洋米二千包左右、下週內可向西貢方面開始訂購、惟因訂購者每包洋米僅付定洋四十元、而尙有二十五元左右之墊款、勢必由該會籌墊、計首批訂米　款約六萬餘包、故該會已準備籌集該項墊款、聞籌集方式仍照以前辦法、概有該會常務委員認借、或由常委用私人方式、向外籌借、但此次款項爲數不多、故可不成問題、所訂洋米、暫時限於次號米、若干團體僅付定洋二十元、該會，昨起已專函催促補繳定洋一倍、最遲本月中旬前須繳淸、</p>

<h3 id="c110">我所認識的野孩子 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 趙振</p>
<p>「救救野孩子」不是一個呼聲，而確是件很重要的工作，該腳踏實地的去做才是。</p>
<p>說起野孩子，在人的記憶裏，就會被喚起一些面目憎惡，衣衫襤褸，抱着肚子哭喪着臉的惹厭的印象，可是誰曾注意到有許多野孩子，雖是滿臉的污穢，也遮不了他們天生成的可愛的端正的臉的輪廓；雖是衣衫怎樣的破碎，有時他們的小腳毫不受拘束的隨意交叉着或點着，也會透露他們站立時正立姿勢的美，這些還都不值得我們的注意，更寶貴的是他們的內在的美——美的心靈，他們不是天生成的潑野無禮，沒有羞恥心，願意向人乞憐，愛罵人，只是他們周圍的一切是早已被支配定當的了，他們的來到世間，過的並不是生活，沒有享受，只有受苦，活生生地被環境擠迫至死，——因為若沒有天外的幸運掉到他們的頭上，這些野孩子，百分之九十九是沒有「超生」的希望的。</p>
<p>這裏我要介紹幾個所調野孩子，可是他們再不喚起你憎惡的印象，可愛，坦白無私，聰敏，這些純潔的形容字，是只配描畫他們的，這些野孩子，都是我在抗戰後的收容所裏遇到的。</p>
<p>首先我要提起的是浩，他是個圓臉，身材並不高大，十二歲左右年紀，是最玲瓏不過的，他最會說話，他說話最傳神，他最能用誇張的字句形容，因此他說話最惹聽，他又有一個高吭的嗓子，當他唱大刀進行曲「大刀向……」的時候，是最叫人興奮的，但是當他唱「我們都是沒家歸的流浪兒……」時，誰都會被深深的感動着，他又愛拿了短棒，歪着頭，作大合唱時的指揮，許多時候他都是可愛的。</p>
<p>貴是一個瘦長的孩子，笑的時候，常會露出他黃黃的牙齒，可是這也並不覺得他的不可愛，他應對最流利，常常我見他赤了脚，在他們簡陋的課室裏跑着，我就問：「貴！你為什麼不穿鞋子？」他直捷坦白的回答：「哪裏有鞋子？」裝裏自己使人看了歡喜的這些虛榮，還沒有進入他的思想，他是沒有父母的，在收容所裏，什麼事他都自己當心，許多時候，他還幫助別人的事，據說為將來謀生計，他已學了申曲了。</p>
<p>阿四是一個誠實的孩子，他的誠實只須看他的臉就可以知道了，他喜歡談談家常，他喜歡說許多規勸別人的話，在我和他們離別的時候，他幾次的真誠的流了淚。</p>
<p>難道這些都是野性的表現嗎？有許多許多再好不過的孩子，就是要使人知道野孩子的實質是怎樣的。</p>
<p>現在正在暑期裏，初高中的學生們，很可以利用空着的校舍，辦一下暑期學校，這倒是給愛教育學的實地試騐，不只是野孩子得了恩惠，同時一般學生也可以得到另一種學問，還有暑期裏閒着的小學教員，也可以幹這件工作。</p>
<p>假若單是每一年的暑期或寒假，辦這種義務學校，我覺得還不大妥當，該有什麼機關或是熱心教育的大善士，大規模的舉辦才是，因為野孩子所缺少的，並不是只有教育，並且還缺少維持生命的食糧，他們不能無衣無食的空着肚子受敎育，因為人終究是人。野孩子們需要的是敎和養！因此，惟有敎和養，雙管齊下，才是使野孩子得救的方法。</p>

<h3 id="c111">海底懷戀 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 東風</p>
<p>像時常惦念着遠行的朋友一樣，我時常想念起家鄉的海！那祖國偉大莊嚴的靈魂。</p>
<p>但如今，我對於海的關係，似乎已超過「想念」的程度；我已不能抑制住對於她過度的關懷熱愛，以及因為她而苦惱而憂　的感情，是「想念」的昇華吧，正像一個年靑熱情的孩子第一次嘗到愛情底甜漿時候的心情那樣？</p>
<p>在石榴花初紅時節，我開始做了一個夢，那是屬於　的：</p>
<p>「……我們幾個時常碰到的年輕人，在吃完了最後　塊野餐會上的麵包，我們望見海已伸着她那灼熱的手走過來，她的姿態是豪放，洒脫，但帶一些急躁，她吻着淺灘上那些發亮的幸福的貝殼，她又吹着那熟悉的口笛，我的朋友們奔過去歡迎她，我們在她的滑潤的手上接過吻，我們遂熱　地擁抱她那腰肢，然而，驚異佔據了每個人的心頭，我們都覺到她瘦了，但不一回，我們又都明白了：三個年頭來　她底孩子，她底家的橫被侮辱，她苦悶，焦慮，她也憤怒，她於是消瘦了！」</p>
<p>「接着，我們同聲唱起雄偉歌；和三年前我們唱的一樣，海，終於顫抖地笑了，她合我們一起唱，我們的歌聲傳到更遠更遠的海面上，我們聽到從島嶼那邊激來的回聲……」</p>
<p>現在榴花已老了，但我底懷戀是會更熱烈的！我今天偶然從某一家公司的櫥窗前經過，我看見一幅海底遠景，以及淺灘上穿着漂亮泳衣的女郎，我底心又強烈地震動了一次，這是諷刺麼？對於一個懷戀着海但又不能看到海的孩子？</p>
<p>我希望今晚皎潔的月光下，我會重溫一次海底甜夢——現實是苦澀的，衹有夢，你給我安慰。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3 id="c112">年靑人 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦</p>
<p>在黑暗裏，年靑人勇敢地摸索着，手刺破了，臉也擦傷了，鮮血點點地滴下來；然而年靑人沒有葸縮，痛苦是年靑人珍貴的侶伴，年靑人的心頭上開着希望的花……。</p>
<p>人們的譎詐曾一度沮喪過年靑人的心，一個世界竟充滿了虛偽與欺騙！然而年靑人立刻被一種新的信仰所鼓勵了：光明正直的新世界是等待我們年靑人來創造的呵！</p>
<p>年靑人沒有詛咒，更沒有埋怨；年靑人的體魄同他的意志一般剛強。靑年人處處造成他們寶貴的經騐，他們知道：經騐在人生的征途上該是一個有力的工具，沒有它他們將不會達到輝煌的成功寶座下面。</p>
<p>年靑人是人類中最幸福的人了吧，荒唐淫佚的靑年人該知道他已做了一件虧本的交易，把一顆寶石竟像砂礫一般的擲在垃圾堆裏！</p>
<p>莫辜負了靑年人的使命呵，靑年人才是一切工作的能手哩！</p>
<h3 id="c113">磨煉 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 雷星</p>
<p>夜晚。電燈忽然壞了。我點起一支素燭。靜寂的屋子配了一色黯淡，有奇異的風味。</p>
<p>燭光搖曳，何以我的心也不能安寧？跌落在靜謚的氛圍里，思索的觸角擾亂了我的心緒，失掉平衡。</p>
<p>生活是磨煉，人却常脆弱得忍受不了情感的熬煎。所以我企求有一顆漠然的心。現實是殘酷的，它賦給年靑人一段苦難和憂患的歲月。以是我學習冷酷。</p>
<p>可是，今夜我又不能控制自己紫色的思維。</p>
<p>有位友人遭逢了點人世的不幸。他却淡淡的說：「我不哭也不笑，沒有慚愧也沒有驕傲。我用自己的肩膀承担「命運」的重閘。在一串日子裏人得把握住必然。」我以最大的稱頌和讚美回答他。</p>
<p>電燈出人不意的亮了。過強的光度有點刺眼。但人的心境也開朗了不少。</p>
<p>生活是磨煉。火的日子終將镕冶出堅強無比的新生代。我又有了確信。</p>

<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>「耳環呢？」</p>
<p>「伊有好幾副耳環，一副翡翠的，一副鑽石的，還有一副年奶珠的。不過伊出去時不一定戴耳環。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「我相信昨夜裏伊一定戴耳環的。」</p>
<p>金梅道：「我倒不留心伊戴的是那一副。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忽插口問道：「你們昨夜最初發現伊時，伊的手上和耳朶上都沒有首飾了嗎？」</p>
<p>金梅疑遲道;「我——我不會想到這個，沒有細瞧，大槪是沒有了。因為從那時以後，除了姜小姐以外，沒有別的人來過。後來就是這個——」伊的眼光瞧着倪金壽。</p>
<p>倪金壽接口道：「後來就是我來了。是不是？……那末，伊昨夜回來以後，會不會自己將首飾卸下來呢？」他這最後一句，好像在自己問自己。</p>
<p>霍桑忽自動答道：「我想不會。伊回來以後，連沾了泥的高跟鞋沒有換掉，決不會先卸首飾。你瞧，伊的一雙胡屐式拖鞋也本來在長椅底下啊。」</p>
<p>倪金壽向我坐的方向隨意瞧了一瞧，又問金梅說：「伊的首飾放在什麼地方？我們衹要檢點一下，就可以明白。」</p>
<p>金梅向那淺藍色噴漆的鐵箱指了一指。「這鐵箱裏有一雙小小的首飾盒子。」</p>
<p>倪金壽把鉛筆入了，身子向前一傾，正想立起來的樣子，卻又意外地來了一個小小的打岔。　（三九）</p>

<h3 id="c115">電影的使命 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>電影負有暴露罪惡，表揚忠烈，針砭時事，啟迪知識的使命，因為電影的感人至深，可以使悲哀的人快樂，同時也可以使快樂的人悲哀，可以使暴躁的人和藹，同時也可以使頹喪的人振作，直接間接，它具有影響社會的力量，是不容輕視的。</p>
<p>精神病者最合理的治療，據一九三六年好萊塢電影感化院的統計：一九百八十七個精神病人，完全給電影感化痊可的，占十分之八·二以上，當警察發見了一個精神病者或自動送院後，感化院立刻加以嚴密的檢驗，分別其為性的·思想的·行動的種種病態，就其病態與程度，而予以感化。例如：患性精神病的，則除了在病房中設備種種關於性的圖書與模型使其潛移默化以外，晨起和臨睡以前，便放映三十分鍾關於性的苦悶，性的解放，再歸結到性的桎梏，和遵以性的智識來使其朝夕相接觸，不久便自然會發生出一種糾正的力量來」。電影的力量可以使精神病者感化，它那所負使命的偉大，與夫關係社會的利害，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>因此，電影的本身也少不了文藝，文是文字，是美的代名詞，藝是工作，是精妙的技巧，電影是工具，而文藝是聰明的結晶，有影無文，有術無藝，卽使全片製成，其空虛也實在等於白紙！而况誨淫誨惡，摭拾僅僅以消遣尚且有害的小書彈詞來攝製所調「民間電影」呢？</p>
<p>近來上海各製片公司爭攝所謂「民間電影」，我們竭誠地希望他們能切實底負起電影的使命，和切實底注意電影本身的功能。</p>

<p>一座旅館里，住着警察廳長馬幼甫，稅務局長康悌，團長馮少豪。旅館的主人杜九姑娘，則是一位美貌多姿的女郎，非常惹人喜歡。因此那些高貴的人物，居然不顧自己的身份，追求着她。而且熱烈地，下意識地，一個誇耀有勢，一個誇耀有錢，彷彿具有理想的把握，可以博到她的垂靑。但是她呢？不過應付應付，一個都不喜歡。其中，那位團長馮少豪，因為從來不肯接近女人，甚至對待女人還有一種毫不客氣的態度，倒是使她發生興趣。她想征服這種男人，所以運用靈巧的手腕，終於使他動搖起來，迷惑在她魔力下面。結果，正當他們自私中間發生衝突的時候，她在他們面前宣佈，她與一個旅館的僕人范升結婚了，因為她懂得，衹有她與范升，才是一對忠實的伴侶。最後並且要求他們立刻搬開這座旅館。</p>
<p>這是「女店主」的故事。在戲劇性上，「女店主」的演出，充滿嬉笑怒罵的成份，正像鏡子一般，照出舊社會制度中一般的真偽面目。</p>
<p>唐若英的杜九姑娘，白口和動作都很流利自然，第二幕中第二段，以一種心理的素描寫出征服馮少豪的姿態，寓莊重於詼諧中使人感到非常可喜。周芻的馮少豪，一種傻氣的表演，相當成功，當被杜九姑娘偽意的惑後，以及求愛二節，演來都足增強喜劇的空氣。邵華的馬幼甫，似以丑角的姿態演出，借錢和飲酒的種種場面，雖則生動活潑，但這與劇中人的身份似乎不合理的。　凡的康悌，面像化裝極是神似，最後決鬥一幕，演來相當緊湊，其餘任銓的范升，陳玉麟的王二都很稱職。</p>
<p>歸納說來我們可以接受這部喜劇；不過使我們笑了後，却要以理智去分析其中的蓄意。</p>

<p>「我需要結婚！」那是好萊塢熱男子詹姆史都華說的話，的確像他這樣年紀的靑年，是應該結婚了，而且和他同住的伙伴又都離開了他去結婚了，這怎麼不敎詹姆眼紅呢！</p>
<p>雖然，他的艷史比別人來得多，如維姬妮白羅斯，洛麗泰楊，琴逑羅吉斯，瑪琳黛德麗，瑙瑪希拉，茜蒙茜蒙，宋雅海妮等幾個著名女星都曾一度和他交遊過，但是她們都不能算是他終身伴侶的對象；據詹姆自己說，雖則我希望結婚，但如果一個女子不能合乎我理想的話，那我情願一輩子不結婚，在我所熟悉的許多同事中，只有瑪格蘭莎利文才是我理想中的對象，可是她已是一個有夫之婦了。」</p>
<p>啊「像瑪格蘭莎利文那樣的女子」！詹姆的友人們都在替他留意了，終於一個叫李蘭霍華的朋友給他找着了詹姆理想中的女子，那人就是美麗的奧麗蓉哈佛蘭。</p>
<p>這種迅速的羅曼史，使每個好萊塢的影人都感到萬分的驚奇。奧麗佛從英格蘭回來後，和詹姆史都華是更加熱絡了。詹姆也曾向她求過婚，她也並沒有拒絕。所以這杯喜酒大槪準可喝定。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Broadcast by Chairman Chiang to the United States <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>China and the United States jointly maintain justice, defend peace, and resist aggression to the end, as China's due responsibility. Increased US aid to China is now beyond further delay.</p>
<p>Chongqing - The National Broadcasting Company of the United States earnestly requested Chairman Chiang to broadcast to the United States on the third anniversary of China's War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Chairman Chiang acceded to this request, and at 6:15 AM on the 8th, delivered a speech to the United States via international radio. It was immediately translated into English by Madame Chiang and rebroadcast across the United States by the National Broadcasting Company of the United States. This was precisely at 6:45 PM on the 7th in the United States, coinciding with the end of the workday for most Americans, thus ensuring a large audience, estimated at over twenty million. Subsequently, a telegram from Manila reported that the broadcast was received with excellent clarity.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang stated that to the esteemed people of the United States, your country's radio station has requested me to speak to your people via broadcast today. On this significant anniversary marking the beginning of the fourth year of China's War of Resistance, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with American friends and feel it is particularly meaningful. Our two countries, China and the United States, are not only friendly nations separated by water with close ties, but also allies with the same aspirations and equal responsibilities in upholding justice, defending peace in the Far East, and protecting human civilization. The American people understand the significance of China's War of Resistance most clearly. The sympathy and assistance that the United States has shown to China's War of Resistance are not only appreciated by all Chinese military and civilians, but also inspire them. China's War of Resistance has been going on for three years. I do not need to elaborate on the situation of our war. Our war is arduous, but it is also steadfast and sustained. Due to our steadfast resistance, Japan's military strength has been greatly depleted, as you all know. Three years ago, when China rose up to resist aggression, we decided not only to use our full strength to defend our national survival, but also to defend international integrity, human justice, and peace in the Far East and the world. The goodwill of the American government and people in assisting us in various ways is seen by me and the Chinese military and civilians as best repaid by resolutely resisting aggression to the end. Our obligations and goals will not be achieved unless we resist to the end. We believe that China should resist aggression regardless of all sacrifices, which is China's national obligation to its ancestors, as well as an obligation to the overall situation in the Far East and world peace. We feel that the sympathy of the world's friendly nations for us is not out of favoritism towards China, but to jointly fulfill their responsibility to maintain humanity and justice and eliminate aggression. In today's world of drastic changes, we in China feel even more strongly the importance of the value of our past resistance and the enormity of our future responsibilities. I dare to assure you that China will definitely fulfill this responsibility, and at the same time, I hope that friendly nations will promptly fulfill their due responsibilities. I firmly believe that my request to the American people to jointly sanction Japan is not at all presumptuous and will definitely receive an effective response. I personally have two feelings regarding the attitude of the American government and public since the September 18th Incident. The first point is that America's attitude against Japanese aggression has remained consistent. The second point is that I feel that the United States is prudent and deliberate before taking action, but once it decides to act, it is very resolute and unambiguous. As President Roosevelt said, "Peace cannot be achieved by hope and empty words alone." From this sentence, I see that "America's prudence is America's resolution." But now is the time for the United States to take necessary steps. In order to implement America's consistent anti-aggression policy and to curb the source of fire in the Pacific as soon as possible, I believe that increasing aid to China is now beyond further delay. The American people should not only be the backing for American national policy but also actively promote the realization of American national policy. In 1937, I once said, "Once the power of justice and righteousness is unleashed, it will surely achieve its purpose." Today, in my position as the commander-in-chief of China's War of Resistance, I reiterate these words to American friends. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>US Presidential Secretary's Article on Chinese Affairs Causes Disappointment</p>
<p>Chongqing - A recent article by Roosevelt's private secretary, Mr. O'Leary, put forward suggestions regarding the Monroe Doctrine for the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Political circles here have not yet had time to study and comment on it. However, upon receiving this news, all sectors of the Chinese community unanimously expressed deep disappointment. Their first reaction was that the United States is now adopting a policy of "transformation" and abandoning its position as a leader and supporter of international justice and pacifism. The Chinese are particularly disappointed because Chairman Chiang had just appealed to the United States to adopt a more active policy and provide assistance to China. According to O'Leary's article, President Roosevelt believes that countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas should unite within their respective regions to resolve land ownership issues themselves, rather than being decided by an aggressive power. The US government hopes to see and believes that Europe and Asia should implement the Monroe Doctrine, consistent with the interpretation and implementation of this doctrine in the Western Hemisphere.

<p>Chongqing - Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, in a detailed review of the major battles in the Sino-Japanese War over the past three years, stated that as of May of this year, the total number of Japanese casualties had reached 1.6 million. 83% of Japanese able-bodied men have already been conscripted into the army. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese mobilized 25 divisions, later increasing to 29, and now reaching 33. At the beginning of the war, China had 2 million soldiers, but this has now increased to 5 million, with millions more currently in training. As of May of this year, the Chinese army has captured a total of 760 field guns, 3,300 machine guns, and 69,000 rifles. As of February of this year, 12 provinces have seen fighting: Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangdong. In addition, parts of the three provinces of Hunan, Fujian, and Guangxi have also seen conflict. Among the aforementioned provinces, the Japanese army occupies 8 cities and 532 counties, with only 58 counties being fully occupied. In the remaining 474 counties, the Japanese army can only occupy the land within the city walls, while the area outside the city remains under the control of the Chinese army. Minister He believes that the Japanese battle lines are too long, stretching from the Mongolian desert in the north to the South China Sea in the south, which is far beyond the capacity of the Japanese military. The current favorable situation on various front lines is due to this reason. In addition, according to Bai Chongxi, Chief of Military Training of the Military Affairs Commission, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out three years ago, the total number of Chinese troops, including provincial armies, was less than 200 divisions. However, the number has greatly increased, and today, the number of mobile troops alone exceeds 1 million. China currently has 4 million reserve soldiers, with over 50 million men of military age, of whom 30 million have received preliminary training. In view of the need for officers, many new schools have been established, including one each for military transport, military supply, mechanized units, cavalry, and infantry schools, as well as eight branch schools of the Central Military Academy and two training organizations for guerrilla members. 10,000 graduates have been assigned to various war zones.

<p>Chongqing - Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Air Force Zhou Zhirou stated today that as of April 30th of this year, a total of 848 Japanese aircraft have been destroyed in air battles over the past three years, of which 256 were shot down by Chinese fighter planes, 253 were destroyed on the ground, and the rest were shot down by anti-aircraft gunners and other troops. A total of 1,055 Japanese airmen were killed, 51 were captured, and 42 went missing after their planes crashed. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing - Four waves of Japanese aircraft, totaling over 100, came to bomb the city again today. Many Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them and were very effective. Many Japanese aircraft were dispersed. According to Chinese sources, at least two Japanese aircraft were shot down. The Japanese aircraft appeared to be targeting the Jialing Apartments, the only foreign residence in Chongqing. Three bombs landed at the entrance of the air raid shelter in the apartments, and one bomb landed near the parking lot. Fortunately, there were no casualties. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, over 100 Japanese aircraft in four groups attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing. The first and second groups focused on bombing the western suburban area outside the West Gate near the Consular Lane. The third group bombed the area further west along the south bank of the Jialing River. The fourth group bombed the area along the north bank of the Yangtze River. Many bombs fell into the river. The anti-aircraft guns did not fire, allowing the Chinese fighter planes to intercept the Japanese aircraft each time they appeared over Chongqing. When the fourth group flew over the city, the air battle was particularly fierce. Several Japanese aircraft were seen to disperse from the main group and were still being fiercely attacked by Chinese fighter planes. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador Craig today informed Japanese Foreign Minister Arita of the British government's reply to Japan's request to stop military supplies from being transported to Chongqing via Burma and Hong Kong. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Arita expressed deep regret over this reply and asked the British government to reconsider the matter. In its reply, regarding the issue of transporting war materiel via Hong Kong, the British government stated that the Hong Kong government has already strictly prohibited this export, so the British government believes that this matter has complied with Japan's request. As for the issue of prohibiting the transport of military supplies via Burma, the British government has considered it. However, since these goods include Burmese and Indian goods, it is naturally very difficult to prohibit legitimate trade. In addition, a review of last year's records shows that the rainy season began at the end of June, so until September, the amount of goods transported via Burma was even less than one-tenth of the normal amount. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that the fact that Japan did not simultaneously request the Soviet Union to close its route to Chongqing when requesting Britain to close the Burma Road was not intended to deliberately embarrass Britain. However, when the Japanese government will protest to the Soviet Union about supplying military supplies to Chongqing and how to protest, cannot be said at this time. The spokesman also said that at a time when Japan has not yet negotiated this issue with the Soviet Union, the Japanese government hopes that all countries will cooperate with Japan to stop trade with China, so that the Sino-Japanese War can end as soon as possible and meet the hopes of Japan and other countries. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, presented to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon a reply to Japan's protest regarding Hong Kong and Burma supplying China with military supplies.

<p>Chongqing - Although Chongqing is under Japanese air raids, the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement Exhibition still opened as usual this year at the Jialing Apartments. The items on display at the exhibition site are sufficient to prove the excellent results of various industrial products made in China. It is found that the Chinese Industrial Cooperative has established thousands of small industrial units across the country in the recent two years, and their monthly output value reaches a huge amount of five million yuan. The items displayed in this exhibition include various cotton, silk, wool, and linen textiles and leather products. In addition, there are various machines and machine tools, which are even more significant because this kind of output is of great benefit to the widespread development of industry in the Chinese interior. Not only that, but the exhibition also displays alcohol, chemicals, canned medicines, and pottery, further proving the remarkable effectiveness of the industrial cooperative movement.

<h3 id="e10">The Monroe Doctrine Expounded by the US President <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The international situation is rapidly evolving in various directions, undergoing qualitative and structural transformations. Let alone how this evolution will end, which is something that the most powerful forces cannot grasp at present; even the current situation is beyond the expectations of the forces that created it.</p>
<p>If we allow the situation to transform as much as possible, allowing it to evolve naturally, then apart from lamenting and questioning where it will all end, there is no way to foresee its future or predict its ultimate outcome. What we can foresee is that each side will do its best to continue fighting; after the war, the victors will continue their posture as rulers, the vanquished will struggle furtively, and those fortunate enough to be outside the vortex will also be uneasy. Thus, the three will each do their best to compete in armaments and prepare for another war. Competing for strength and victory, seeking control and plotting revenge, it is clear that there will never be stability, let alone an ultimate outcome. Did not Emperor Napoleon have the wisdom to accept the historical lessons of more than 1,700 years, yet he was ultimately exiled? From the "Holy Alliance" of Russia, Prussia, and Austria to its transformation into the Quadruple Alliance of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Britain, using absolute authority to dominate Europe, it eventually disintegrated. The Treaty of Versailles ended the last European war, but ignited this one, turning everything to ashes. Back then, who did not want to create an immutable situation? Those who hoped for it to remain unchanged still saw it changing endlessly, let alone now when it is rapidly advancing towards drastic changes!</p>
<p>The United States, being on the sidelines, probably does not want to sit idly by and watch the international situation evolve in a chaotic manner! Is this not the motive behind President Roosevelt's recent authorization to Secretary O'Leary to re-expound the Monroe Doctrine? This exposition involves both Europe and Asia and is aimed at the current evolution. Its main points are roughly as follows: "If Germany demands all the territories of France, Britain, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere, the United States does not intend to make efforts to take over these territories, but will invite the American countries to decide whether to place these territories under a trusteeship system until they can be returned to their original owners." The original Monroe Doctrine of the United States was issued in 1823; at that time, the European "Holy Alliance" wanted to exert its monarchical and divine power to interfere in the many newly independent and free countries in the Americas; therefore, US President Monroe issued this declaration, opposing European countries controlling the fate of these new American countries with various pretexts or methods. Therefore, what Roosevelt ordered to be expounded this time is still the original intention of that time, but it is not only that; it involves Europe and Asia, and makes suggestions that are almost proactive and constructive for this extremely turbulent and changing situation. Therefore, it is also said: "The President stated that the United States has no intention of interfering with land issues related to adjustments in Europe or Asia. What the US government wants to see and believes should exist is the implementation of the Monroe Doctrine in Europe and Asia, consistent with the interpretation and implementation of this doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. For example, regarding the issue of French Indochina, the United States believes that all countries in Asia should consult and reach a decision. Disputes in Europe and Asia should be resolved by the countries in Europe and Asia themselves. The disposition and management of the islands and other territories conquered by Germany within the Western Hemisphere should be resolved by the American countries."</p>
<p>Regarding this declaration with profound significance, we deeply regret not knowing it in more detail and more concretely. Even based on the above quotation, we certainly do not want to intentionally misunderstand or maliciously distort it, and hope that the telegram transmission is accurate. Then, we cannot but interpret it as the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of European countries' territories in the Americas must be discussed by the American countries, that is, it is not convenient to let the victor decide it;</p>
<p>(2) It recognizes that the territories of the warring countries in Europe and Asia have room for change;</p>
<p>(3) The territorial changes in Europe and Asia must be discussed by all the countries in each continent. It is not convenient to let the victor decide it;</p>
<p>(4) Matters involving more than one continent must be decided by all the countries in the relevant continents;</p>
<p>(5) The so-called Monroe Doctrine in Europe and the so-called Monroe Doctrine in Asia may not be recognized, but they must be like the original face of the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas; that is, respect the independence and freedom of each continent and each country, and not allow other countries to control their fate.</p>
<p>Regarding these, we do not want to elaborate, but hope that the interpretation is not erroneous.</p>

<p>The current urgent tasks for youth: 1. Understand the era; 2. Uphold ideological beliefs; 3. Establish a revolutionary outlook on life.</p>
<p>Chongqing. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, Chief Chiang issued a letter to the youth of the nation, stating in brief:</p>
<p>Our nation's war of resistance has exceeded three years. In the past, I, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to gather the new forces of the Chinese national revolution and ensure the success of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, specially created the Three Principles of the People Youth League. Since its establishment to the present, it has been two years. Our national youth, in difficult and arduous environments, have done their best, worked hard, tried their best to provide relief to compatriots in distress, provided voluntary care for wounded officers and soldiers, been loyal to the Party and the country, served society, and studied to strengthen themselves. All have experienced extraordinary forging and tempering, and their development and growth, compared with the past, has achieved substantial progress. However,</p>
<p>reviewing the past and considering the current situation, the efforts that the country and the nation require of our youth are increasing day by day, and the daily diligence and efforts of our youth to improve themselves and serve the country are still insufficient. In the progress of the work of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, they have not been able to exert their full strength and fulfill their duties. There are even those who cannot overcome the difficulties of the environment, and thus hesitate and feel depressed, leading to pessimism and depression. The impact of this on the future of the nation and the success or failure of the revolution is immense. Today,</p>
<p>all the youth of the nation are the successors of our nation's great culture and the creators of our country's bright future. The heavy responsibility of revolutionary nation-building rests on the shoulders of our youth. Therefore, I, Chiang Kai-shek, truly believe that all careers and all responsibilities are entrusted to our youth to complete the new life of succession. My expectations for our youth are like those of family members for their children. Now, as the War of Resistance has exceeded three years and the second anniversary of the founding of our Youth League is approaching, and at this important juncture of the country's final victory, I must sincerely and earnestly inform all the youth of the nation about the</p>
<p>basic understanding and genuine efforts that youth should have at present. The reason why life is valuable lies in having foresight for the future, willpower for action, and ideals for life. This is the characteristic of mankind, and especially so in youth. What kind of era do we live in? In this era, what will we do, what will we show, what will we achieve in order to satisfy our own aspirations and achieve an ideal life? This is the common feeling and necessary understanding of any young person. The success or failure of a young person depends on how they perceive it, and then</p>
<p>correctly and firmly adhere to this understanding of an ideal life, then their heart will be at peace and their spirit will be strong, and they will surely move forward directly. If they are uncertain of this understanding or only have knowledge but it is not correct or firm, then hesitation and depression are inevitable results. Why do young people today have the phenomenon of hesitation and depression? It is because they have failed to truly understand their era and environment, and therefore have failed to properly consider their responsibilities and future. What I believe to be a proper consideration is, first of all, to recognize the country in which we are born and the relationship between the individual and the country. Living in China today, it is necessary to first seek</p>
<p>national independence and national liberation, and only then can there be talk of a truly ideal life for the individual. How to achieve national independence and national liberation? This is the question of how the national revolution can succeed. The success or failure of the national revolution depends on whether its revolutionary ideology is realized. If this ideology is great, correct, and complete, and suitable for the revolutionary environment, then the ideology will surely be realized and the revolution will surely succeed. If this ideology is not suitable for the era and environment of the Chinese revolution, then it will definitely not be realized. If the ideology fails, the revolution will inevitably fail. Therefore, if the youth of today truly wish to realize their ideal life, they only need to</p>
<p>understand the era and national environment, understand revolutionary ideology, determine revolutionary thought, recognize the path, and devote all their efforts. Then all depression can be broken, the meaning of life will be clear and unwavering, and there will be no pain of hesitation and confusion. From the above, it can be seen that if our youth want to break through psychological hesitation and depression, and earnestly shoulder the mission of history and the era, the most urgent tasks are no more than (1) understanding the era, (2) upholding ideological beliefs, and (3) establishing a revolutionary outlook on life. Speaking of the current era in China, since the outbreak of our sacred War of Resistance, we have reached the critical juncture of the survival and continuation of our Chinese nation's five thousand years of historical culture. It is also the pivot for our descendants of the Yellow Emperor to be reborn and</p>
<p>turn weakness into strength to open up an infinitely bright future. The Japanese, with their army, navy, and air force accumulated over forty years, are making a desperate gamble against China. And we, with inferior military equipment, have fought hard for three years and stood firm. Moreover, the foundation of our country's victory is becoming increasingly solid. This kind of arduous and extraordinary battle, and the resulting</p>
<p>major achievements, such as the reform of politics and economy, the promotion of social culture, and the transformation of the era and environment, are not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also open a new era in world history. From the observation of people from third countries, or the descendants of future generations looking back at this earth-shattering history, they will truly not know how to admire the glory and greatness of our Chinese nation at this stage. How fortunate are our youth to be born in this greatest period in history? They must never fail to live up to this</p>
<p>once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity. If they can develop their revolutionary spirit and use it in the struggle for revolutionary national salvation, then their career achievements will be unprecedented. The independence of the country and the liberation of the nation must be obtained with our blood and sweat. From this, we can create our true life, and also open up infinite life for the youth who come after us. Born in this era and serving this national destiny, we must never despair and give up on ourselves, but should seize the era and shoulder the responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future for the nation. Everyone should contribute their intelligence, work hard at their duties, give full play to the glory of their lives, and fulfill their revolutionary responsibilities and obligations. This is why we</p>
<p>actively improve ourselves and eliminate hesitation and depression. The first key is to talk about steadfast ideological beliefs. The most important ideologies advocated by various countries in the world today are nothing more than Fascism, Communism, and Democracy. The so-called democracy is a product of capitalist countries. Over the years, the environment has changed, and it is definitely not as thorough as the Principle of Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, and it cannot solve the issue of civil rights truly and completely. Communism focuses on the economy, and its theory is based on the interests of one class, and it cannot provide a perfect and rational solution to the entire issue of people's livelihood. As for Fascism, it only focuses on the interests of its own nation and ignores the interests of other nations, and it is even less comparable to our ideal and progressive nationalism. All of these are biased and incomplete, and each has its shortcomings. Only the</p>
<p>Three Principles of the People created by our Premier are different. It starts from the most sincere and acts with the utmost impartiality, with the philosophy of people's livelihood, universal love, and helping the masses as its principle, and world harmony, mutual assistance, and shared enjoyment as its goal. Its content is complete, concrete, and feasible, and it is sufficient to solve the three major problems of nation, civil rights, and people's livelihood in the world today, without any bias, incompleteness, or inversion of priorities. The Premier's key to practicing nationalism is: (Nationalism must be practiced first, and then one is qualified to talk about cosmopolitanism). His key to developing the Principle of Livelihood is: (Everyone should aim to serve, not to seize). It can be seen that my Three Principles of the People, compared with Western countries that use private capital (possessive desire) to stimulate production, or with the methods of (historical materialism) and (social revolution), truly have</p>
<p>a world of difference. Moreover, the Three Principles of the People is based on reason, emotion, and law, so it can make the most appropriate adjustments to human survival and evolution. Moreover, from the perspective of the foundation of the establishment of various ideologies, the philosophical foundation of Western countries inevitably focuses on nouns and things. Only the philosophy of people's livelihood in our Three Principles of the People can combine the spiritual and the material. As for revolutionary power, it emphasizes the development of spiritual power even more. The Premier once said: (Revolutionary power is 90% spirit and 10% material). Because we have this consistent</p>
<p>revolutionary philosophy as a foundation, although the materials on which the revolution depends are lacking, the more the revolutionary spirit is developed, the more it can last. Looking at the changes in the world situation during our three years of War of Resistance, it is truly amazing and unpredictable. A few countries in Europe are no longer able to exist as freely as in the past, or they are destroyed in just a few months, or even defeated in a few days. The reason for this is that there is no most appropriate ideology to be commonly believed and practiced as a foundation for establishing a career, thus causing spiritual turmoil and disappearance. And the reason why our country can fight more and more firmly and stand firm today, in addition to our vast land and people, is actually due to the greatness of the Three Principles of the People, so that every Chinese youth can</p>
<p>truly recognize that only the Three Principles of the People is most suitable for the revolutionary environment of China, everyone firmly believes in the Three Principles of the People, earnestly follows it as the guideline for revolutionary action, with one heart and one mind, seeking to implement it thoroughly, then the Chinese revolution will definitely not fail, even if there is a temporary advance or retreat or setback, and the ideological beliefs are universally and deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people, the national revolution will eventually have a day of success. Related to upholding ideological beliefs is the establishment of a revolutionary outlook on life. To put it plainly, it is to recognize the true meaning of life. Why are we born? Having been born in the current era and world, what kind of responsibilities do we have to the country, the nation, and the world and mankind? Why do we need to make a revolution? How should we work hard to succeed?</p>
<p>The revolutionary cause. In short, what kind of people should we aspire to be in order to be worthy of our ancestors and parents and of future generations? This is what I call a truly ideal life, which can guide us to the greatest success. The establishment of a revolutionary outlook on life is nothing more than recognizing the position of the individual in the universe and the distinction between the relationship between the group and the individual. In terms of the individual's view of the universe, Chiang Kai-shek once said that the universe is a structure of infinitely large space and infinitely long time, while our individual life is as small as a grain of millet in the vast sea and as short as the appearance of a night-blooming cereus. However, the infinitely large space is our stage, and the infinitely long time is our journey.</p>
<p>All things in the universe are born for us and wait for us to use them. "Therefore, we are the masters of the universe. We must conquer nature and use all things to increase human life. In terms of the relationship between the group and the individual, Chiang Kai-shek also said that the purpose of life is to improve the life of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create a life that continues the universe. From the previous, our youth must exercise their physique and increase their intelligence to achieve our goal of conquering nature and using all things. From the latter meaning, our youth must also break through the individual</p>
<p>life and death barrier and eliminate the selfish mentality of self-interest. Knowing that the youth of China today are born for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, and for the survival and happiness of all compatriots. Their death must also be for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, and for the survival and happiness of all compatriots. If they can understand the true meaning of life, then strive towards this, fight forward, create and advance, and there is no reason to hesitate and be depressed. Our youth's clear understanding of the era, ideology, and life is still not enough. If we do not pay attention to the way of practicing and implementing them thoroughly in order to realize the ideals of life and our revolutionary ideology, then all problems will still not be solved. In this way, even if there is an understanding, it is not thorough, and there will still be no follow-up in practice. Today,</p>
<p>most young people have ultimately failed to fully develop their full and abundant life force to make the contributions they should make, and thus have failed to transcend the state of hesitation and depression. This is because they have a considerable understanding of the revolutionary ideological theories and the characteristics of the era, but lack the sincerity and courage to practice them diligently, do not know the path of practice, and lack the spirit of solid practice. They only know how to talk and cannot put it into action, which has led to the phenomenon of emptiness, superficiality, hesitation, and stagnation today, which is not only criticized by society, but also a loss to the revolution. In the future, what young people should unanimously awaken and seek to extricate themselves from is how to put their confirmed ideology into practice in order to complete their ideal life. This requires</p>
<p>the spirit of independence and self-reliance, and the ability to struggle and create. They must not be content with ease and comfort, and willingly become backward elements who sit idly by and rely on the efforts of others. They must not follow the world and float and sink with the vulgar, and have no truly established views on reality, but are merely incited by superficial and shallow propaganda, so as to trap themselves in confusion, disorder, and depression and hesitation. In this rare era and with the profound and broad Three Principles of the People, if our youth can firmly believe in it and practice it diligently, how can they not have the opportunity to practice their ideology, serve the country, and save the world? However, if our youth cannot maintain the spirit of self-respect and independence, or because they cannot endure the economic and living hardships, they will</p>
<p>blame heaven and earth, and harbor all kinds of resentment and prejudice towards the environment, or be tempted by superficial and erroneous propaganda, and waver in their will and change their original intentions. Once the spirit loses what it relies on, then action will inevitably fall into obsession. The ancient sages of China taught people with (extensive study), (careful questioning), (prudent thinking), (clear discrimination), and (diligent practice). The main idea is that everyone can work hard to reflect on themselves, expect a lot from themselves, blame themselves severely, and constantly work hard to complete their sound personality. The key to the success or failure of our youth's life and career lies in this. Whether we can become</p>
<p>great people who stand tall between heaven and earth also lies in this. What needs to be especially vigilant is that the result of the current youth's hesitation and depression is often to give up their basic work. They are often negligent of their due obligations and duties and do not know how to strengthen themselves. This is the biggest shortcoming of young people. We should know that our youth are determined to do great revolutionary things, which is to save people and save the world. To save people and save the world, we must place ourselves in the lowest level of society and approach the most suffering compatriots in order to improve the social environment and relieve the suffering of compatriots. Only then can the great revolutionary cause have a day of success. If we abandon this basic work and pursue fame and fortune and status, then not only will personal desires not be satisfied, but it will also be completely contrary to our revolutionary outlook on life. We must know that when we engage in revolution, we must first contribute, and then we can achieve something. We must first sacrifice, and then we can</p>
<p>get the price. The so-called sacrifice and contribution means that, as the Premier said, everyone must hope for the success of the revolution, so they must first sacrifice their personal freedom and personal equality, and contribute everyone's freedom and equality to the revolutionary party. Everyone must abide by the party's discipline, and everyone must obey the party's orders. The entire party must act in unison. Only when the entire party has freedom, and the individual cannot be free, can our revolution succeed. This is truly the precious teaching for our youth to engage in revolution, and it is also the only way to revolutionary success.</p>

<p>Tokyo. The semi-official "Japan Times" recently published an article discussing the US government's recent commercial blockade measures, stating in brief that exports from the Dutch East Indies to Japan have greatly increased recently. The United States is closely watching this and has launched a strong economic counterattack. Its intention is to maximize the export of important raw materials such as oil, rubber, tin, iron, bauxite, chromium, and nickel from the Dutch East Indies to the United States. Regarding this matter, the Dutch East Indies authorities have provided Japan with a guarantee that they are willing to continuously export the above-mentioned important raw materials to Japan without any restrictions. Japan is discussing the implementation of this guarantee with the Dutch East Indies authorities. The United States hopes to obtain the necessary military raw materials from the southwestern Pacific, which is the same as Japan's hope. For example, 90% of the rubber and 70% of the tin needed by the United States come from the southwestern Pacific. Apart from this, there are no other sources at present. Recently, the US government decided to establish rubber and metal reserve companies, each with a capital of US$5 million, to purchase rubber, tin, manganese, etc. from the Dutch East Indies. However, the exact amount is still unknown. As the United States has actively moved, Japan will inevitably quickly catch up and compete with it. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>Hyde Park. President Roosevelt yesterday told Postmaster General and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee James Farley of his historic decision to run for a third term. Farley met with the President for two hours. Although the President told Farley that he was willing to run for a third term, Farley kept it a secret and refused to disclose the contents of the conversation. At the end of the conversation, Farley told reporters, "The President was very frank with me, and I was very frank with him." Farley said, "The President's intentions are very clear to me, but I cannot tell anyone else. Only the President himself has the right to talk about this matter. I feel that the people of this country want the Democratic Party to continue to maintain its power. I already have this feeling. I spoke with the President in great detail about the Democratic Party's campaign rally and slogans. We will do our best to make the party's campaign rally even more magnificent." A reporter pointed out that the President should clarify his attitude as soon as possible, otherwise the Democratic Party representatives at the Democratic National Convention on July 15 will be in a dilemma. Farley replied, "Only the President himself can answer this question. I cannot answer it for him." (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<p>Chicago. Vice President John Nance Garner, who opposes President Roosevelt's third term, led party members in various pre-campaign activities yesterday and established the headquarters of this movement here, because the Democratic Party's ten million dollar campaign performance will be held on July 15. The Vice President's vanguard established its headquarters in the Sherman Hotel here yesterday. The banners hanging in front of and behind the Garner headquarters read, "Follow Garner." Judging from the situation, this office will officially begin work today amid the clamor of shepherds. At the same time, a group of well-known Chicago businessmen are promoting Missouri Senator Bennett Champ Clark as the Democratic presidential candidate. As a result of President Roosevelt's refusal to declare his position, other candidates' attitudes are vague. Federal Security Administrator Paul V. McNutt is a supporter of Roosevelt's re-election. However, if Roosevelt withdraws from the election, he will participate as a presidential candidate. He reserved many large rooms in the Stevens Hotel yesterday, but it was not known as of last night whether he would station campaign personnel there. Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, who opposes President Roosevelt's re-election, also established a campaign office here and will begin work today. Democratic National Committee Chairman James Farley will arrive here on Tuesday. The work of the Democratic Party's campaign goals will begin after New York Senator Robert F.

<p>Hong Kong: According to an official announcement, navigation between Hong Kong and Vietnam resumed today. Previously, authorities in both Hong Kong and Haiphong mutually detained vessels after France ordered its colonial troops to fire on any British ships sailing within twelve and a half miles of French territory. All British and French ships, except those of Japan and the United States, were prohibited from navigating. Now, with the British and French authorities reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement, British and French navigation has resumed today. (Reuters-Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Telegraph reported today that authorities deny the Haiphong news reported by the Japanese news agency, which claimed that all British ships in French Vietnamese ports had been captured by the French authorities. This is completely unfounded. The newspaper also reported that Hong Kong authorities recently prohibited British and French ships from sailing to Vietnam, and Vietnamese authorities also prohibited British ships from leaving the area. However, the two sides soon reached a compromise, and passenger ships between Vietnam and Hong Kong are now operating as usual. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The situation in Hong Kong is very peaceful today. British and Japanese authorities are currently working to clarify the situation in Vietnam. Navigation and aviation between Hong Kong and Vietnam, which were suspended last week due to a decision by the Vietnamese political authorities, resumed today. At least five French ships were blocked in Hong Kong and unable to sail, and the French gunboat Argus remains in the harbor today. These ships were released today after British and French authorities reached a satisfactory agreement. The British Royal Air Force's flight route has now been temporarily changed to pass through Chongqing to Rangoon (Yangon), which is a response to the Japanese demand to block the Yunnan-Burma Road. In addition, the Japanese airline between Guangzhou and Bangkok has now begun to be allowed to stop in Hanoi, which was previously rejected by the Vietnamese authorities. Well-informed sources believe that the evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong has reduced the tension in Hong Kong, and attention has now shifted to Vietnam. The situation in Vietnam remains unclear to this day. Although Japan is still implementing a blockade on cargo transportation from Hong Kong to the mainland, there is no evidence of increased Japanese pressure on the Hong Kong border.

The first batch of mail was shipped on this route yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Residents of Hong Kong are still taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the evacuation of women and children. However, today they believe that the situation here will be the same as in Tianjin, which recently ended. The general feeling is that Japan will continue to blockade Hong Kong by land, just as it did with Tianjin before. However, apart from a long exchange of diplomatic documents between the British and Japanese sides, it is believed that no serious incidents will occur. There is no special indication of involvement in the recent crisis. The British garrison has not canceled its routine leave, and the situation on the border of the leased territory remains peaceful.

<p>Manila: A passenger ship arrived here today carrying 1,700 women and children who boarded in Hong Kong, most of whom are British. The U.S. military has reserved several large barracks for the majority of the refugees to stay in. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Manila: The heavy rain here stopped slightly this morning, and the refugees from Hong Kong disembarked one after another. These 1,758 people were stranded on ships in Manila Bay yesterday due to the rain. U.S. military officers also came to the scene this morning to oversee the disembarkation of the refugees. Six sick people were moved from the ship last night, but none of them were in serious condition. Despite protests from the relatives and friends of the refugees, the military police at the pier strictly enforced the rules and did not allow anyone to board the ship. After the evacuees left the ship, the soldiers quickly ordered them to board vehicles and send them to the temporary inspection station at Fort McKinley for customs officials to inspect their luggage. All refugee families must strictly abide by the rules, gather in one place, and not allow children to leave their parents to avoid getting lost. Today, the Red Cross opened four dormitories in Manila and moved the refugees away from Fort McKinley after they were inspected. The society also sent some refugees waiting for treatment to the Emmanuel Hospital, and the medical expenses were also provided by the society. Saiyi, a senior U.S. official in the Philippines, personally inspected the situation on the ships, and the British Consul General in Manila, Smith, said that he was very pleased with the orderly disembarkation of the refugees and the efforts of the Red Cross and the U.S. military. HSBC also sent representatives to board the ship to allow the refugees to exchange bank drafts for Philippine pesos. The refugees were all exhausted and complained a lot. Most were dissatisfied with the forced evacuation, saying that it was neither necessary nor helpful. Many others complained about the Chinese people, saying that the evacuation was due to the fact that most Chinese refugees in Hong Kong were unwilling to leave. They also believed that the Hong Kong authorities' evacuation order was only to prevent food shortages. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

Heavy rain has been falling on the Philippines for seven days, the severity of which has not been seen since 1919. The flooding of rivers has caused more than 85,000 pesos (Philippine currency) in losses. Authorities fear that the losses in the southern provinces may be even greater. Since the storm began, no damage has been reported in the south. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>French Side Accuses Britain of Bad Faith; British Authorities Sternly Refute</p>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Churchill and Navy Minister Alexander have refuted the French Minister of Information, Prouvost, who claimed that Britain sent a "savage ultimatum" to the commander of the French fleet in Oran and that Britain had not contacted the Pétain government. Britain gave the French fleet in Oran the opportunity to sail to French West Indies, but the Pétain government ignored it. Churchill spoke about this in detail on July 4. As for the claim that the British government has not contacted the Pétain government, it is also untrue. According to British Navy Minister Alexander, he personally went to Bordeaux to meet with French President Lebrun, Prime Minister Pétain, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Navy Commander-in-Chief Darlan. After the armistice conditions were announced, he and British fleet commander Pounde again called on Darlan, but ultimately felt that his request was futile. A senior staff officer of the British army in France yesterday refuted in detail in London the French accusation that the British army failed to follow General Weygand's plan at the end of May, saying that on May 22, British Commander Gort met with French First Army Commander Billotte at Ypres. Billotte explained in detail Weygand's plan for the French army to attack from the south of the Lys, while the British army and the French First Army would attack from the north of Douai and Valenciennes, so that the north and south would attack together. However, that night General Billotte died in a car accident, causing obstacles to the joint attack. On the night of May 19, the British army's right wing and rear were in a dangerous situation, and the British army had to deploy temporarily assigned troops to garrison in Lens, Douai, and Arras. They had rifles, some machine guns, and a few direct-firing guns, but no heavy artillery. However, they still fought fiercely with the enemy. At the same time, the French army on the British army's right wing had suffered extremely fierce attacks and lost a lot of military equipment, so in a state of chaos, it took several days to reorganize the army. There was a gap of about ten miles in the French army's southern front, leading to the Somme River, and the situation there was unclear. On May 20, it was decided to send two divisions of British reserve troops from Arras to attack, but a French division on the left was not prepared to attack. British Commander Gort believed that this attack had to be carried out, and ultimately achieved its first goal south of Estaires, inflicting heavy casualties on the German army and capturing many prisoners. However, German mechanized infantry had already infiltrated through this gap. In the following two days, the German army almost surrounded the British army. At that critical moment, Britain withdrew to Douai. Therefore, on the day Weygand drafted the plan, the British army had only one cavalry regiment in reserve, and the ammunition supply was not very optimistic. At that time, the ammunition available in France was 160 rounds per gun, and the British army also lacked small arms ammunition. Although it was planned to supply ammunition by parachute, it was not entirely successful. The food supply was also short, and the troops only received half rations. On May 24, due to the defeat of the Belgian army, two British divisions had to immediately move to the Belgian front to prevent the enemy from using a pincer strategy to advance on Dunkirk and cut off the British army's retreat. The next morning, he went to see French General Blanchard, and saw that he and his staff were planning to retreat as soon as possible. General Blanchard could only do this. Weygand's plan was commendable on paper, but it was too late. The first reason was that the number of German troops entering this area was large. The second reason was that the British army's left flank had been lost, and there was not enough strength to deal with both wings at the same time. At that time, the British army was defending a front line 75 miles long. The part of Weygand's plan that the French army should attack to the north was never realized. Even if the British army carried out the plan on May 26 and won a great victory in reaching the city of Cambrai, the area from Ypres to the northern position was empty, with no British army defending it, and the British army might not be able to meet the French army in the city of Cambrai, because the French army did not move out. At this point, the British side determined that it would lose the 5th and 50th divisions. During the retreat, the German army launched a frontal attack at Ypres, resulting in the slaughter of these German troops. The British army mostly did the defensive work on the sides of the British and French armies. The British army was waiting for news that the French army would attack from the front, but there was none. If the British army was surrounded, the defenders could only launch a breakout war, but if they wanted to break the siege, they would have to rely on external assistance. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy: French Information Minister Prouvost broadcasted a response to British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks in the House of Commons regarding the British military action in the port of Oran, accusing Churchill of "maliciously assassinating the Dunkerque" and "sending a savage ultimatum" to the commander of the French fleet in Oran without contacting the Pétain government.

<p>Berlin: German submarine commander Brünning spoke to reporters about the unprecedented victory of his submarine patrolling the sea. This time, a total of 66,587 tons of enemy ships were sunk. Commander Brünning said, "This was a grand patrol. It started extremely smoothly. The submarine first rescued three German Air Force personnel, who were very strong in body and spirit. I wanted them to stay on the submarine. On the third day of the patrol, we let them row a small boat in front of the submarine. They can be called the lucky stars of our submarine, because everything went very smoothly. We used all the torpedoes and shells in the submarine. After we bombed and sank nine giant ships, we encountered a 15,000-ton mutual ship on the return trip, which greatly increased the tonnage we sank to 66,587 tons. The torpedoes took a long time on the way, and then we heard a huge explosion. The torpedoes had hit the middle of the enemy ship. Flames erupted, and the great Britain lost another 15,000 tons. When we returned, we were in high spirits, and the ammunition in the submarine was exhausted." Then one of the Air Force personnel told me about his experience, saying, "My plane flew to Britain for reconnaissance, when suddenly a Blenheim enemy plane attacked my plane. The water tank in the plane was badly damaged, and one engine was also damaged. The captain was seriously injured, and I was also shot. My plane landed on the sea. The British plane kept shooting at us. When we rowed an inflatable boat about 50 yards away from the plane, the British plane left. My plane could no longer be used and immediately sank. We had no choice but to row the boat. It was very far from the coast. We had enough provisions, but very little water. The future was very bleak. The captain was dead, and my injuries were also getting worse. After we rowed the boat for 40 hours, we suddenly heard the sound of an engine. We were very afraid that it was a British ship. When we burned the remaining documents, a submarine appeared from the fog, and we saw people signaling to us. Later, one of us recognized Commander Brünning." (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German military expert spoke to a Haitong News Agency reporter, supplementing yesterday's battle report, saying that the German blockade of Britain has been effective. Yesterday's battle report stated that German submarine Captain Brünning sank 66,000 tons of enemy ships during a long-distance cruise. A German speedboat sank a 6,000-ton enemy ship near the Isle of Wight, within the range of the British coastal defense battery. These are all significant results of Germany's blockade of Britain. The fact that German speedboats can threaten British shipping in the same way as submarines has now been proven by facts. The German Air Force also participated in commercial warfare. During a bombing raid on a certain part of southern England, bombs hit ships in the port, causing them to catch fire and burn on the spot. The German Air Force bombed the British Navy, and a cruiser (10,000 tons) was hit by our bombs and suffered heavy damage. Two auxiliary ships were also hit and sunk. Yesterday, an enemy submarine was also destroyed by our plane, and the crew members were rescued by our naval patrol boat. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>London: The British Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security issued a communique last night stating that there was continued activity near the coast of the English Channel this afternoon. However, due to heavy anti-aircraft fire, no major air raids occurred. Several houses were bombed in the coastal areas, with slight casualties. This afternoon, a German fighter plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire off the coast. A Spitfire British fighter plane shot down two Dornier German planes over the English Channel, and another German plane was seen to be injured or unable to return to its base. British and German planes fought fiercely in the air over the English Channel, and two German planes were likely destroyed, as one was seen with smoke coming from its engine, staggering erratically, and the other flew out of the firing line, descending rapidly and disappearing. The remaining German planes turned around and fled. It is now confirmed that German planes flew over the coast at several points around dawn and attacked again in the afternoon, but with no obvious results. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, thousands of people witnessed a British Spitfire fighter plane shoot down two German Messerschmitt 110 fighter planes over the English Channel.

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet for Ciano at a hotel. Marshal Göring's newspaper stated yesterday that Ciano's purpose here was to clarify "various issues concerning Southeastern Europe" and to discuss organizing a "new European order." The visit of Italian officials to Germany is "another indication of the strong solidarity of the Rome-Berlin Axis." The Berlin meeting will enable countries occupied by Germany to "soon see the work of new national construction." The Soviet Union's activities in Southeastern Europe pose "various problems" for the Rome-Berlin Axis, and these problems must be resolved by Germany and Italy.

<p>Rome: Authoritative sources reported last night that Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano discussed various issues in Berlin this week, one of which concerned the future of the Dutch East Indies and French Vietnam. Authoritative sources stated that both here and in Berlin, significant attention is being paid to the relationship between French Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and Japan. Authoritative sources pointed out that since the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, Japan's relationship with the Rome-Berlin Axis has been subtly damaged. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>London: According to a Berlin dispatch received in Rome, Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's talks reached complete agreement on the continuation and development of the war and the establishment of a new Europe. According to the Italian official news agency, Ciano left Berlin by train last night to tour German-occupied territories in the West. This trip will pass through the most important areas of the former Western Front and will last about two days. Accompanying him are the Director of the Treaty Department of the German Foreign Ministry and senior officers and instructors from the German High Command. Furthermore, according to the Swiss Basler Zeitung, Hitler and Ciano discussed the invasion of England at a meeting in Berlin yesterday, with Ireland being the first place to be attacked. The two also discussed the joint adjustment of future continental relations and policies. However, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung's Berlin dispatch stated that the two leaders' meeting may be related to the development of Southeastern Europe, as Germany and Italy have the same concern for the peaceful resolution of all issues in Southeastern Europe. It is generally believed that Ciano's visit to Berlin is not necessarily related to the change in attitude of the Chiang Kai-shek government. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Geneva: The French Senate and Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to meet on the 9th of this month. It is generally expected that the National Assembly (i.e., the joint session of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies) will meet the following day to discuss constitutional amendments. About 450 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are expected to attend (out of a total of over 900 members of Parliament). (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Geneva: According to a special report received by this newspaper yesterday from the Haitong News Agency, French politics are currently undergoing transformation. It is still difficult to determine the future of the French people at this time. In the past five days, the French Parliament has met to discuss matters, and old and new ideas are still mixed together. This is because France and its people are not yet accustomed to the new elements. Under these circumstances, how to make French political parties abandon their past political theories and take on the new work of France is still a question. According to a Haitong News Agency reporter, ideological conflicts occurred on the first day of the Parliament's meeting. Some members of Parliament still insisted that the drafting of the new French Constitution should be debated and decided by the Parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Laval delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies, stating that the Pétain cabinet had no intention of opposing the Parliament, but would decide to oppose the Parliament when necessary. The Pétain cabinet has other tasks: to save the country and rid France of the habit of parliamentary empty talk. Laval's speech indicated that the Pétain cabinet was seeking the Parliament's consent but was also prepared to implement new political plans for France even without the Parliament's consent. In the future, the Chamber of Deputies' authority will be to pass bills proposed by Laval, not to pass bills authorizing the government by the Chamber of Deputies. This law must be passed without reservation, and the Parliament must not amend it. After the French government obtains this privilege, it will announce the new constitution that has already been drafted. This constitution stipulates that the Senate and Chamber of Deputies can only technically manage government policies. It is said that the constitution was drafted by Laval, based on the Italian government system, but still retains the characteristics of French politics, that is, the powers given to the French Chamber of Deputies are greater than those of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. The new constitution stipulates that the powers of the French provincial governments will be the same as those of the German governors, that is, the provincial governments are directly under the government's command and only have the necessary administrative powers at the local level. Since France has had a centralized political system since Napoleon I, the adoption of the new political system should achieve results early. To date, French governors have only been local police chiefs, directly under the Ministry of the Interior. In the future, the governors will be the leaders of a province, subject to the orders of all government ministries, especially the Ministry of Agriculture. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)</p>

<p>Geneva: The French radio station issued a message yesterday stating that the French army is currently implementing demobilization, allowing soldiers to return to their hometowns as soon as possible to engage in agricultural work. Therefore, France's demobilization work is not based on seniority but depends on the agricultural needs of various regions. Therefore, regardless of seniority or age, those who are urgently needed in various regions to engage in agriculture can be demobilized first. The radio station continued to say that France currently faces extreme difficulties in transporting food, and there is a lack of transportation. Therefore, it is impossible to demobilize the entire army at once. Moreover, local authorities in various provinces are already finding it difficult to supply local food. If the entire army is demobilized and returns to various regions, it will definitely increase the local difficulties. Therefore, the government hopes that officers and soldiers at all levels will remain calm and wait for gradual demobilization. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington: The Foreign Policy Association released a report yesterday stating that if the United States and the Soviet Union establish an agreement to jointly guarantee China's independence and maintain the status quo in Southeast Asia, the United States' Far East defense will be further strengthened. The report stated, "Unless the United States and the Soviet Union conclude such an agreement, the Soviet Union, which continues to aid China, will not be provoked to interfere with Japan's expansion of power in the South Seas." Germany's progress in Europe has caused the United States to encounter a dangerous problem in its Western Pacific policy. As for the new US-Japan commercial treaty, it is even said that ceding China as a gift to Japan to fill Japan's insatiable desires is indeed doubtful. As for whether a strong plan can limit Japan or provoke retaliatory actions, it is still difficult to determine for the time being. "Unless the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate closely, any US action to oppose Japanese aggression may only be effective when the US fleet can be stationed in the Pacific without taking into account the Atlantic." (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Yarnell Attacks Japan's Control of the Far East</p>
<p>Washington: Former US Asian Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell recently made a statement attacking Japan's control of the Far East. He said, "Recently, newspaper editorials have mostly advocated the establishment of a treaty and a new commercial treaty between the US and Japan to improve the US's position in the Pacific. This kind of argument is of course due to the influence of the European war. Whether these people who advocate the establishment of an agreement or a commercial treaty between the US and Japan have a thorough understanding of the nature of the war in the Far East and Japan's goals in the Far East, I really cannot help but doubt. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japan's history has been a history of aggression against China. Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria have been seized by the Japanese. The fate of the people under Japanese control has not only not improved but has worsened. Korea is one example. Japan's sole purpose is to enslave the local people and control prices through monopolistic methods, so that all profits go to its own benefit. All foreign commerce and power must be completely excluded. Japan has taken these steps in the occupied areas of China. The Japanese government in Tokyo is completely controlled by the military. The policy of the Japanese military is to occupy all of China and the British, French, and Dutch colonies in the Far East, and to exclude the Western people altogether. Japan is also a totalitarian state, and its war aims are completely the same as those of Germany and Italy, namely, to rule most of the world and hundreds of millions of foreign people by force. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's policy is actually to gain control of all regions in the Far East, and his so-called "Monroe Doctrine" is obviously a misunderstanding and is used to deceive the United States.</p>
<p>Peace Can Only Be Ensured if China is Stable</p>
<p>The greatest driving force for seeking peace in the Far East and the world is to make China a free and stable China. The United States has signed a treaty with Japan, asking it to help maintain China's independence and territorial integrity. To date, any treaty with Japan will inevitably contain the following conditions: (1) Abandon the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy, and recognize these treaties as waste paper; (2) Recognize the "New Order in East Asia;" (3) Abandon and sell out China, which is fighting for freedom, and make its people disappear from hatred; (4) Abandon the position achieved by American businessmen, doctors, educators, and priests through many years of effort; (5) Expand absolutism throughout the world. This issue, the basis of our future policy, is extremely important. Will we base our policy on principles of morality, honor, justice, humanity, human rights, and respect for promises, or will we cross out these principles and compromise with totalitarians, hoping to establish a situation that allows both ideals to coexist in the post-World War organization? Under the current circumstances, if we negotiate with Japan, the only result we will obtain will be national shame." (United Press, 8th)</p>

He found the leaders of the two opposing factions among the fleeing crowds and finally reconciled them. Currently, military and police are stationed at every street corner here, and the situation remains very serious. According to the headquarters of the National Revolutionary Party, the party's presidential candidate, General Camacho, has won in 22 of the 29 states. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Mexico City: Thirty people died and fifty were injured in the riots during yesterday's election here, a bloody tragedy unprecedented in decades. Although the authorities here made every effort to prevent it beforehand, four people died and fifteen were injured in the capital. There have also been reports of casualties in other cities. According to the government's Revolutionary Party radio transmission, General Camacho received the most votes in this election. However, those who support General Almazán, the commander of the Madrano army, have said that these reports are altered by the enemy party. According to the US authorities' estimate a month ago, confusion will inevitably occur. The results of Sunday's vote will not be officially announced until August 25. Although the military and police throughout Mexico are armed, it is difficult to predict whether this riot will lead to a nationwide revolution. Former Army Chief General Hohmann, who is supported by the Mexican Nazi Party, and Tabia, who has the support of a small number of people, are also candidates in this election. Today, General Almazán re-warned that if there is fraud in this election, he will organize the Congress he leads as a "legitimate government." Observers believe that he may be able to carry out this statement. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: Conflicts occurred in Puebla province during the Mexican presidential election. Because there are currently two major opposing factions in Mexico, the competition is fierce. The governor of the province is the younger brother of Camacho. The Camacho faction and the Almazán faction clashed, resulting in two deaths and two injuries in the Almazán faction. A conflict also occurred in Mexico City, but only one person died, namely General Francisco. The murderer has been arrested. It is heard that the Camacho faction has the upper hand in most polling stations. According to current estimates, 47 people have sacrificed their lives due to conflicts arising from the presidential election. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>Cairo: Details of the British Air Force's recent attacks on Italian submarines in the Mediterranean have been released as follows: a British seaplane, while patrolling, glimpsed a submarine periscope and quickly dropped a special bomb. Two bombs hit the submarine's conning tower. The submarine's head rose out of the water and then sank vertically, with oil spreading hundreds of yards away. The next day, the seaplane saw another Italian submarine on the sea surface and dropped bombs on it, hitting it several times. The submarine immediately overturned, and several crew members were blown into the sea. The British aircraft then landed on the water and rescued three lieutenants and one junior officer. When the aircraft was flying back, it saw another submarine on the sea surface, but because there were no bombs left in the aircraft, it flew low and fired guns at the submarine's conning tower and bridge twice. The submarine then sank vertically. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e44">Fujian Education Director Publishes Opinions on Inspecting Southern Fujian Education; Generally Satisfied with the Schools' Operations <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yongan Correspondence: Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Fujian Education Department, inspected schools at all levels and social education institutions in six counties, including Datian, Dehua, Yongchun, Anxi, Nan'an, and Xianyou, in March of this year. He returned to the provincial capital of Yongan in April and recently published the following impressions of his inspection:</p>
<p>Generally, I am satisfied with the operations of the schools in southern Fujian. Generally speaking, the students' physiques, spirits, and attitudes are extremely strong and lively, worthy of being the best in the province. The academic atmosphere is also quite good. Even the current situation of the few schools that had accidents in the past is not as serious as rumored. In terms of primary education, because most of the people in southern Fujian live overseas and have ample financial resources, enthusiasm for education has become a common practice. If one village sets up a primary school, another village will definitely set up another primary school to compete with it. As a result, there are many cases of schools being built with sole investments. After the school system was reformed this time, Nan'an County alone has established a school in almost two townships. In the Shishan area, a school has already been established in one township. The number of schools in other counties also exceeds the provincial standards. In short, in terms of the number of schools established, with the exception of Datian and Dehua, the general standard has been met. In terms of faculty, there is a temporary shortage before a large number of teachers are trained in this province, and many are not satisfactory. In terms of school buildings and equipment, the common characteristics of Nan'an, Yongchun, Anxi, and other counties are that they are mostly new stone and lime buildings built with private donations. Director Zheng also attaches great importance to overseas Chinese education. After returning to Yongan from the inspection, he instructed the relevant departments to allow overseas Chinese students from various schools in the past who participated in the graduation examination and failed one or two subjects but went abroad without taking the make-up examination to be allowed to take the make-up examination by the consulate of their place of residence entrusted by the department. He also instructed them to prepare investigation forms and distribute them to various schools to fill in the names of overseas Chinese students who should take the make-up examination, the subjects they failed, and their residential addresses. In addition, because the procedures for overseas Chinese students transferring to schools in the province are often not fully compliant, he also ordered the drafting of "Instructions for Overseas Chinese Students Transferring to Schools" to be sent to the consulates of various places to inform the schools in those places, so as to facilitate overseas Chinese students returning to the province to study.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Jiangsu Education Department Holds Graduation Spot Checks for Middle Schools; Over Twenty Schools Spot Checked in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department has adopted the spirit of the middle school graduation examination and organized graduation spot checks to adapt to the current environment. It has been reported previously. It is now learned that Director Tian had previously issued various measures related to the graduation examination and graduation spot checks, stipulating that the graduation examination for all middle schools in northern Jiangsu this year should start on June 19 and end on June 22. All three-year graduation examinations should start on June 19 and end on June 22. All courses studied in the past three years, such as civics, Chinese, English, arithmetic, history, geography, chemistry, biology, and education courses for normal schools, and vocational courses for vocational schools, are included in the examination. The examination time is stipulated by the department, and all schools in the province hold the examination at the same time. All test papers are sealed. Each school organizes a graduation examination committee, with the principal as the chairman. The Jiangsu Education Department organizes a graduation spot check committee to be responsible for all graduation spot check matters in the province. On the one hand, it sends personnel to carry test questions to various schools for spot checks. Schools that are not spot checked will not be notified separately and will be handled by the graduation examination committee at that time. The principal is responsible for presiding over all aspects of the graduation examination. It is heard that this time, over twenty public and private high and junior middle schools in the northern Jiangsu province and counties were spot checked, which is helpful in urging students to work hard to improve their level.</p>

<p>Yongan Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government, in view of the lack and simplicity of music equipment in schools at all levels in the province, which makes it difficult for good teachers to exert their teaching effectiveness and reduces students' interest in learning, greatly affecting the future of music education, but it is very difficult to purchase from abroad at this time. In order to solve this problem and encourage production, it has ordered the provincial music college to establish a musical instrument factory and has allocated funds for preparation. It is now learned that Principal Cai Jikun of the college, after receiving the order, has begun active preparations for selecting raw materials and hiring technicians. According to Cai, there are many high-quality timbers produced in the province, and some are suitable for making violins and other stringed instruments.

The factory also plans to set up a repair department to repair various brass and woodwind instruments, as well as harmoniums and pianos.</p>

Therefore, it is proposed that the entire sum be inherited by his family members, but the inheritance rights must be transferred through legal procedures. As for the school's fund, Principal Jiang will raise it separately, so that both public and private interests can be taken care of.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Seventh Act of Hezhong Cup Basketball: You Lian vs. Qun Yi Today; Xi Hua vs. Mu Er at 5:30; Women's Performance Added on Saturday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The schedule for this week's Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball League has been announced yesterday. Starting at 5:30 today, the first game will be between Xi Hua and Mu Er in the second division. The strength of the two teams is evenly matched. Starting at 6:30, the game will be between You Lian and Qun Yi. You Lian's recent two results were a victory over Qi Fan and a loss to Xi Qing in the Bai Le Dou Championship. The performance shows sharpness. The victory over Qi Fan was characterized by a strong and decisive fighting spirit. The loss to Bai Le Men was due to a slight miscalculation, leading to a constricted atmosphere. However, their threat to the Shanghai League champion was not diminished. Their loss was truly not their fault. Qun Yi is the incarnation of Xu Fang. Although they have suffered two losses in recent two games, one was to Liang Xi and the other was to Hu Qing. Hu Qing is one of the two giants in Shanghai. Qun Yi only lost by eight points, which shows their skill. Their loss to Liang Xi was because their main player, Tao Shaosheng, was closely guarded by the opponent, resulting in a loss of scoring opportunities. However, Qun Yi had good performances in both games, which shows their strength is not ordinary. Today's encounter with You Lian is bound to create a shocking situation, which can be predicted. Tickets are five corners, and the number of seats is still limited to four hundred. The games at the end of the week will have more exciting situations. In the first division, Qun Yi will meet Bai Le Men on Saturday. This is Qun Yi's true touchstone. The opening act before this game will be a women's performance. The opposing teams have not yet been determined. The organizers are now increasing the interest of the competition and promoting women's basketball, and will try their best to provide the local women's strong teams with opportunities to perform. All strong women's basketball teams that are confident enough to show their skills can register with Zhou Zhi at Bai Le Men starting today so that they can be inserted into performances in the future. The registration date is limited to Thursday (11th) of this week. The first division game on Sunday will be Hu Qing vs. You Lian. The tense atmosphere of this game is expected. At the same time, the prelude will be Bai Le Men vs. Nanyang. This week's order is as follows:</p>

<p>Regarding the protest matters of Xi Hua, the Hezhong Cup organizers convened a committee meeting yesterday. Those present were Zhou Jiaqi, Lu Zhongen, Wen Wanyuan, Zheng Zhifang, and those attending were Jiang Shilin and Zhang Yuanji. The protest letter from Xi Hua team and the reply from Shang Hang team were circulated and the recorder of the game, Zhang Yuanji, was consulted about the situation at the time. However, because the referee Wang Jien was absent due to some reason, the key information could not be obtained.

<h3 id="e58">Finance: American Banks Have Quite a Bit of Inflow; Foreign Exchange Slightly Reacts <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing showed no changes. In the dark market for British-American exchange, the trend entered a hovering state, tightening after loosening, and then loosening again after tightening. As a result, there was a slight contraction. Although there was no fresh stimulus, speculators had a strong appetite throughout the day, but the amount was not large. Throughout the day, American banks had the strongest intention to enter, and the transaction volume was particularly high. The market was slightly affected. At the beginning of the morning, Japanese and Chinese banks both sold, so the potential was long. Later, after American banks and others fiercely absorbed it, it returned to softness. The midday closing was mediocre, and the market situation in the afternoon was also very mediocre. Only because speculators entered the market to buy and absorb, the closing market showed a slight softening. As a result, British gold was at four points, and the American exchange rate was 6.21875 yuan, a decrease of 0.03125 and 0.0825 respectively compared to the closing on Saturday. As for the futures trend, it followed the same path as the spot market.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Still Selling</p>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rate was unchanged for British-American exchange, an increase of 125 for Shanghai, no telegram for French, the American exchange rate increased by eight and a half points for British, a significant increase of two corners and seven points for Shanghai, and no market for French. The central listing of various exchanges remained as before. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was four points for British gold and 6.28125 yuan for American exchange, a tightening of 0.03125 for British and a decrease of 0.03125 for American compared to the closing on Saturday. After opening, Japanese and Zhengjin banks took the lead in selling British gold for 4.015625. HSBC's listing was announced unchanged, and the balance tax on silver was also announced with no increase or decrease. After that, Chinese banks suddenly began selling, and the market became firmer. The current American exchange rate was sold to HSBC for a total of 6.375 yuan. Some Chinese speculators also entered the July American exchange rate for 6.21875 yuan, but soon American banks' buying intentions suddenly emerged, buying the Chinese mainland's current American exchange rate for 6.3125 yuan. The market gradually softened, once retreating to the current American exchange rate of 6.25. However, near noon, Chinese speculators re-emerged in the July American exchange rate, and the American banks' appetite was slightly stagnant, causing the potential to harden again. As a result, there was no difference in honor or disgrace compared to the morning opening price. British gold remained at four points, and the American exchange rate was 6.28125 yuan, and the futures were also the same.</p>
<p>Speculators Absorbing</p>
<p>The market was still flat in the afternoon. After opening, exporters sold to American banks for 4.015625 for current first order. Subsequently, foreign banks did current American exchange rate for 6.3125 yuan, but soon speculators aggressively entered the July American exchange rate, so the price hardened again.

<p>Yesterday's cash bar (smelted gold) dark market situation entered a better state. Although the rise was not particularly fierce, the sentiment was quite upward. Because there were many who hoped for higher prices and made new purchases. The opening in the morning was 5,150 yuan, which was heard to be due to the gold shop gang absorbing it. Subsequently, silver shops sold aggressively, pushing it down to 5,060 yuan. Thanks to the Hong Kong gang and retail investors, it was raised again to 5,140 yuan. The midday closing was 5,115 yuan. The sentiment in the afternoon was quite energized. After opening at 5,120 yuan, it immediately rose to 5,140 yuan. However, a certain gold shop sold some, and it fell slightly again. As a result, it was heard that the exchange rate was tightening, which was good news. There were rumors that "a certain bank" was secretly absorbing it, and securities firms and others searched for and bought some, closing at 5,190 yuan, a rise of 145 yuan compared to the weekend.

<p>Smelted Gold Rises by More Than One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight, and the sentiment was unusually firm. There was a crowd of buyers, and both money changers and gold shops had an appetite, leading to the opening under a buying wave, raised by 105 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 liang to gold shops, for 5,150 yuan. Then, because the price opened too high, it caused many parties to sell, and the number of entrants decreased. Before long, it fell back 60 yuan. Silver shops sold 10 liang to gold shops, falling back to 5,090 yuan. Then, securities firms suddenly showed buying intentions, and sellers decreased, and it was raised again by 40 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 liang from silver shops, for 5,130 yuan. However, a certain money changer suddenly dumped it, and the Tianjin gang also sold secretly, and it fell slightly by 70 yuan again. Silver shops did 10 liang, and the lowest price was 5,060 yuan. After that, silver shop gangs frequently picked up at low prices, and Hong Kong gangs were active in the middle, and it rose again by 80 yuan. Silver shops did 20 liang, and the high price was 5,140 yuan. At noon, the buying wave subsided slightly, and there was a slight drop. Money changers sold 10 liang to silver shops, falling back to 5,115 yuan as the midday closing price. The opening was slightly higher in the afternoon. First, gold shops sold 10 liang to silver shops, for 5,120 yuan. Then, securities firms and money changers absorbed it and it rose by 20 yuan. Silver shops and jewelers did 10 liang, for 5,140 yuan.

Silver shops sold 20 liang to gold shops, for 5,105 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market situation hardened again after that.

<p>Yesterday's securities gray market continued to be weak, and trading also suddenly decreased. No Type Ding bonds were traded at all, and no one inquired about Type Wu bonds in the afternoon. The so-called new loans have no progress news, and the bulls were once excited, but failed to arouse general interest, so the rally was short-lived, rising and falling quickly. There was more trading yesterday morning, with Lianyi Jiufeng and No. 11 being bought quite a bit, and Lemao Datong and No. 16 being sold off. The market price was stable. In the afternoon, Lianhe sold about 100,000, but the buyers were very few, and the market became sluggish. Types Ding and Wu were not traded at all. As a result, Types Jia, Yi, and Bing fell by a dime or two, Type Wu was still good by a dime, and Type Ding had no quoted price. The total transaction volume was only over 400,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e66">Grain Glutinous Rice Rises Sharply by Three or Four Yuan, Foreign Rice Market Suddenly Weakens <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice market initially opened with both buyers and sellers remaining cautious, especially since the price evaluation will be implemented today, causing guest traders to adopt a more conservative approach. Until midday, except for local stores which slightly increased purchases for emergency needs, the rest were rarely inquired about. Sellers, seeing the declining sales floor and the continuous influx of large quantities of foreign rice, and feeling that the general trend was precarious at a high level and about to fall, became increasingly uneasy. In an instant, the prices of various foreign rice types were like a dam bursting, plunging all the way down. As a result, at the close, except for mid- to high-end goods, which were fortunately selling somewhat steadily and depreciated by one to one and a half yuan compared to the previous week, Number One aged Saigon was 65 yuan, Number Two 63 yuan, 62.5 yuan, Number One Siam 65 yuan, Number Two 62.5 yuan, Fire-hulled 64 yuan, 63.5 yuan, Hong Kong Point 63 yuan, 62.5 yuan, Small-hulled 62 yuan, 61.8 yuan. Other lower-grade goods of various types, due to the stoppage of inland routes and the impending implementation of price-controlled rice sales in the local area, experienced even greater decline, plummeting by a huge two to three yuan. The lowest price of Tokyo Stone Point was only 58 to 59 yuan, Red Rice 57 to 58 yuan, Broken Point ranged from 51.2 yuan at the high end to 47 yuan, Second-grade 45 to 46 yuan, Rice Green around 53 yuan. Foreign rice, because the Siam rice ordered and loaded on the 18th of last month had already arrived, people's hearts were slightly discouraged, and the market changed from tight to weak. Yinghua Company opened trading of Siam Number Two rice at a price of 76 yuan in the morning, then dropped to 75.75 yuan to 7 yuan, and at the close it was 75 yuan. The price for cargo loaded on the 20th was 73.5 yuan to 3 yuan, and the price for cargo loaded on the 26th was 72.2 yuan to 72 yuan, all down by more than one yuan compared to the previous prices. The total transaction volume was 775 tons. In addition, over 6,000 bags of spot goods were traded, and the price also fell by about one yuan.</p>
<p>More foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived from Hong Kong with 3,359 bags yesterday morning and berthed at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship also carried over 15,000 bags from Hong Kong, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but due to the typhoon at sea, it was changed to enter the port this morning. (Zu)</p>
<p>Glutinous rice rose sharply by a large three to four yuan yesterday, because goods have been in short supply for a long time, warehouse stocks have been sharply reduced, and scarcity has made the sales floor expensive. Guest traders were afraid of missing out, creating an unexpected high price due to supply falling short of demand. Open-Jin Liyang Special was 70 yuan, Chang Dan White 69 yuan, Second-grade 68 yuan, Jiangbei Second-grade 66 to 67 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice 70 yuan.</p>
<p>Another 1,400 to 1,500 bags of thick and thin japonica rice arrived. It is rumored that outside speculators, influenced by foreign rice, were also showing signs of softening, but the selling price was still unchanged. Changbang Special Clear Japonica still needed 74.7 to 78 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun White Japonica 72 to 73 yuan, Second-grade down to 70 yuan, Qingsi Thin Rice 72 to 73 yuan, Nangang Early Rice Special from 71 yuan, Second-grade down to 69 yuan, inferior quality at 67 to 68 yuan, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Flour Supply Falls Short of Demand Wheat Sources Remain Difficult to Unblock <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was firm yesterday, because the supply from Chinese flour mills was still maintained by Fufeng Mill in this street, at only five or six thousand bags per day. The needs of local traders were naturally not met, so they could only rely on Japanese mills and miscellaneous brands of flour from the inland. Recently, the inland supply has been continuous and the distribution routes have been quite active. Yesterday, Jinshan brand opened at 16.5 yuan, Phoenix brand at 16.3 yuan, and Qiangsheng Flour at 16.45 yuan. The price of the July/August Green Phoenix opened at 16.42 yuan. Inland Jinyou brand flour rose by another dime compared to last week, while Phoenix brand showed signs of loosening. About 10,000 bags were traded. The factory price of Lao Che Brand still maintained its original price of 15.2 yuan. Lao Che recycled flour had no official market price.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market still lacked official development. However, on the Japanese merchant side, it was heard that nearly 10,000 bags of wheat had been shipped in, priced at 23 to 24 yuan. On the Chinese mill side, there were occasional small shipments, but no large quantities could be collected. The news from grain merchants that transport permits would be issued this week still had no concrete measures. It was also heard that Japanese mills had also settled a shipment of American wheat, but this could not be confirmed. On the Chinese mill side, there were indeed contacts for Australian wheat, and continued orders were being placed.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Sales Still Acceptable <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The prices of miscellaneous grains are only traded for half a day in the morning during the summer season. An investigation of the market's buying and selling attitudes did not feel the constraints of time, and yesterday's trading also continued to decrease. The prices of various types were also lurking in a flat, weak, and humiliating state. However, the broad bean market was strongly supported by Japanese merchants and aided by the Xinghua gang, so the trend remained stable. It is estimated that over 1,800 bags of Jiading White Skin Broad Beans were traded at a price of 23.3 yuan to 23 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu Small Grain White Skin Broad Beans at a price of 19.1 yuan, and over 300 bags of Beigang Green Skin Broad Beans at a price of 21.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, one hundred bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and another 480 bags and 300 bags of raw peanuts will be shipped to Hong Kong today. In addition, 1,000 bags of sesame and 1,095 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Yarn &amp; Cotton Yarn Market Quiet, Few New Purchases <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the trend is stable. As for actual transactions, transportation to South China has been reopened, so the Hong Kong gang is more active in purchasing coarse and fine yarns than in the past, and people's hearts have been revitalized. The Zhejiang East region is also constantly purchasing, so although the environment is harsh, the market feels more peaceful. However, there are very few new purchases. Therefore, the situation is still being maintained.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning with a peaceful atmosphere. It also opened for small-scale trading. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 910 yuan. It was then heard that there was not much change in the exchange rate, and although there was no large demand for current sales in the Guangdong gang, small-scale transactions were still able to be maintained. The market gradually rose, reaching 923 yuan, and the close was slightly setback. An investigation of half-day transaction statistics showed 1,985 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by two yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 700 bales of 20-count Tiannv yesterday at a price of 930 yuan. Tongyi Factory opened 600 bales of 23-count Golden Rooster at a price of 1,000 yuan, all of which were internal purchases. There were fifty pieces of cotton yarn yesterday, and another ninety-five pieces today, all of which were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 670, Peers 1,110, Ningbo 55, Total 1,985, Inland 50</p>
<h3 id="e70">Cotton Demand Slightly Active <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading is still in a quiet state. However, the Japanese mills have slightly active demand, but the market price is flat and the attitude of the Chinese mills remains scattered. Tongzhou cotton is priced at 154 yuan, 95 bales were purchased internally. Indian cotton is 180 yuan, 600 pieces were purchased internally, all spot warehouse deliveries. Business is slightly more active and not as sluggish as in the past.</p>
<p>Another report: The spot price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market initially fell slightly in the morning due to selling in the South, but later due to purchases by spot merchants and the offsetting of short positions, as well as spot merchants selling near-term and buying far-term futures, the closing price resulted in the near-term price falling by ten basis points, while the far-term price rose by eight or nine basis points. The Indian market situation is firm. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose sharply by ten rupees.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has gradually become more active in recent days. Japanese factories have slightly active demand, but the transaction amount is not large, all are silver futures transactions. In recent days, there has been a transaction volume of four to five thousand bales. However, Chinese mill trading remains extremely quiet. According to the current situation, foreign cotton has entered a turning point.</p>

<p>The cloth market is flat. Actual sales are still strong. Because the current market is insufficient to cover costs, most cloth factories have temporarily suspended work. The output in the future will naturally be sharply reduced, so people's hearts have stabilized slightly. Traders and dyeing factories are taking advantage of the low prices to search for purchases. The opening prices of various goods are not much different from the previous week. A small portion of cloth prices continued to fall by about 2.5 cents per piece. In this street, tens of thousands of pieces of grey cloth, plain cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth were traded. The Yong-Wen-Tai gang purchased nearly 200 pieces of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, twill, colored cloth, and woolen cloth.</p>
<p>Dongbu White Goods, Longtou fine cloth, opened in the morning at 27.7 yuan, and then rose to 27.95 yuan at the close due to the firm confidence of traders in this street. Four Gentlemen Serge sold from 8.25 cents per yard to 8.3 cents. Over 500 pieces of various brands of fine cloth and about 200 boxes of serge were traded on the market. Among the miscellaneous brands of fine cloth, the Shuanglongzhu brand produced in Qingdao was the most popular, because the source was lacking. The Bengbu gang pointed out that spot goods were sold yesterday for 28.1 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Exports: 4 pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong on the 8th, 1,000 pieces were transported to Ningbo, 60 pieces were transported to Singapore on the 9th, and 18 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. On the 8th, 61 pieces of piece goods arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Although there have been rumors recently about British ships stopping navigation of Haiphong, and there are concerns about the interruption of foreign coal, the white coal business has not been able to increase because actual sales are not moving and local inventories are very sufficient. Yesterday, a certain number opened an old single Tongdeli block on behalf of customers, and the gray market only traded at 188 yuan, warehouse self-pickup, and handling fees were added separately, which was a four to five yuan retreat compared to last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was initially flat and then tight. Because it was rumored in the afternoon that the Hong Kong situation was tight again, and the exchange rate was shrinking, people's hearts turned better. The Association allocated spot goods of 24 coarse white at the warehouse in the morning at 67 yuan to 67.5 yuan, and 78 yuan in the afternoon, up 6 cents. Outside the warehouse, it was only 66.5 yuan to 67 yuan in the beginning, 67.5 yuan in the afternoon, and 68 yuan later.

<p>Dried scallops such as Yantai goods were sold for 600 yuan last year, only because the output was small and the arrival of goods was cut off for a long time, so the bottom stock in the market has been like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. At present, general demanders all rely on Dong goods, and it is heard that the selling price is 535 yuan for large, unbroken ones, and 520 yuan for the second grade.</p>

<p>Hardware transactions have seemed to be trending towards calmness recently. Most of the gang's merchants have returned to their hometowns for summer vacation, and the factories in this street are also experiencing slow sales due to the hot summer, so the market and people's hearts are also declining. The sales of Huisi iron rely on can factories, printing factories, toy companies, cigarette companies, biscuit companies, etc. in this street. However, although there have been purchases recently, the transaction volume has been sharply reduced compared to the past. Outside ports, such as the Qing-Jin cigarette gang, etc., transportation difficulties and high water feet have greatly threatened the customers, so they also purchase less. It is heard that the asking price in yesterday's market has fallen slightly compared to before, such as old steel mill goods selling for 170 yuan per box, and new steel mill goods selling for 160 yuan per box. Because there are no large buyers, the trend seems to be continuing to decline.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Situation in Haiphong Has Eased, Shanghai Defense Line Prepares to Resume Navigation, Awaiting Approval from the British Admiralty for Announcement, Coal Loading Ships to Hongji Have Also Arrived Directly, A Section of the Yunnan-Burma Road is Open to Traffic, Foreign Ships Decide to Bay and Carry Goods from Rangoon <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam is extremely tense, and Chinese and foreign residents in Hong Kong are evacuating one after another. The Shanghai defense line has been suspended for a time. The sailing ships in South China, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and Vietnam, Saigon, Hongji, etc., have all been suspended. Recently, because the United States attaches great importance to the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam, and has a tendency to oppose the actions of the Japanese army, the situation in the two places has eased slightly. It was said yesterday that the Shanghai defense line would resume navigation.</p>
<p>Various Ships Prepare</p>
<p>To resume navigation, Jardine Matheson's Yusheng is scheduled to go to Hong Kong and Haiphong from Shanghai on the 10th. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but did not see it enter the port due to the hurricane until late, and it is expected to arrive at the port this morning, so the sailing period to the defense may be extended to the 11th. Taikoo Company has also dispatched the Qiongzhou Wheel, which is scheduled to resume the Shanghai defense line on the 13th, going to Hong Kong from Shanghai, Bay Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and to Haiphong. Regarding the resumption of the Shanghai defense line, the two companies said yesterday that although</p>
<p>The ships have been dispatched, but they will not be officially announced until the British Admiralty approves them today. The ships going to Hongji from Shanghai to load coal also stopped for a time, but have now resumed. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng Guisheng have been cleared yesterday and are scheduled to export this morning and go straight to Hongji to load coal. M.U. Cingalese Prince of the company's foreign department manager Yitai Company came to Shanghai from Little Luzon yesterday and is scheduled to go to Saigon tomorrow, carrying cargo directly to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Women and Children Going to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The ships on the South China Line to Hong Kong had previously banned the sale of passenger tickets for women and children, because Hong Kong is evacuating women and children, and women and children passengers going to Hong Kong should stop taking the ships. However, starting yesterday, all sailing ships to Hong Kong of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have also resumed carrying women and children and selling passenger tickets for women and children as usual.</p>
<p>River Railway Bridge</p>
<p>The giant railway bridge from Laojie to Hekou was originally the only freight hub from Haiphong to Yunnan Province. Since the French-Japanese agreement was established, the French side has destroyed the bridge, causing all goods to be completely stagnant. The Shanghai transportation agency has stopped receiving freight because passenger cars from Saigon and Haiphong have been suspended, so freight has been completely stopped. Therefore, all goods transported from Shanghai to the southwest inland are changed to be transferred from Ningbo. However, according to passengers who have just arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong, the old street railway bridge connecting Hekou is being repaired.</p>
<p>Yunnan-Burma Opens to Traffic</p>
<p>After Burma became China's only international transportation line, the Yunnan-Burma Highway from Kunming via Dali Tengchong to Lashio has been transformed from the original post road and completed for traffic. The Yunnan-Burma Railway is about to be completed after construction. The highway and railway in Burma connect to a railway to Rangoon for export. From here to Europe, the journey is shortened by 2,500 nautical miles compared to exporting from Hong Kong. The transportation of the Yunnan-Burma Highway is becoming more frequent every day. In addition to the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration to handle highway engineering and transportation management matters,</p>
<p>Handle Porterage</p>
<p>A porterage management office is also set up to handle porterage. At the same time, foreign ships from European countries decided to dock in Rangoon. Various transportation companies plan to handle freight via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. After the Yunnan-Burma Railway is completed, all exports of local goods and imports of foreign goods in China will pass through the road. At present, some foreign ships specialize in shipping goods between Hong Kong and Rangoon. The Yunnan-Burma Road is to open up international thoroughfares, communicate the economy of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, and make the economy of the southwest and northwest a unified whole. Therefore, the blockade around Hong Kong and the suspension of freight transport on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Vietnam to Kunming have no great impact on China's entire international transport.</p>

<p>During the current third anniversary of Japan's anti-Japanese war, when the two concessions implemented special martial law, Japanese plainclothes military police actually sneaked into the US military defense zone with weapons and were arrested by the US defense forces, totaling sixteen people, and detained in the US military camp. After the Japanese side sent personnel to apologize and take back the arrested people, the matter was over. However, the Japanese military spokesman suddenly claimed at the press conference last night that Consul General Miura would apologize to the US Navy, and announced that the Japanese military authorities were making a strong protest to the US Navy authorities regarding the abuse suffered by the Japanese military police after their arrest.</p>
<p>The US Navy spokesman refused to comment on the matter last night, but hinted that a public statement might be released today.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European War and Italy's involvement in the vortex, it has become extremely difficult for officials and nationals of Germany and Italy to travel between Shanghai and Chongqing via Hong Kong and Haiphong, etc., due to the declaration of war between the two countries. They have all changed their routes to the mainland for round trips. Although the transportation is slightly inconvenient, the journey is still rapid. According to a reporter from Dagang News Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications have recently taken this into consideration and have taken measures to protect nationals of the two countries travelling to and from various provinces in the mainland, and have dispatched special commissioners to accompany and protect them. Recently, Counselor Bide of the German Embassy was escorted by two special commissioners on his way from Chongqing to Shanghai, which was very thoughtful.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Accountant Dong Chunbiao Died Wrongfully This Morning, Shot by Thugs as He Left His Residence, Three Bullets All Hit Vital Points, He Fell to the Ground and Died Tragically, Chinese Police Bravely Captured the Murderer Wei Gaofa <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>In the French Concession, 318 Lane, Lafayette Road, that is, the downstairs of the overpass in Yongyu Lane, a shooting occurred suddenly at about 8:05 this morning. The victim was Dong Chunbiao, manager of Daxing Money Shop, who was also an accountant. He was shot three times in vital points and died on the spot. One of the two thugs escaped to the inner door of Ximen Road and was eventually captured by the Chinese police officer of No. 790, who together with another police officer, surrounded and bombarded him. He was shot in the lower abdomen, fell to the ground and was arrested. The details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Dong Tao Co-reside in a Separate House</p>
<p>Dong Chunbiao, a native of Fenghua, is 38 years old this year. He is renting the third floor of No. 6 Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession. The second landlord of the house is Tao Leqin, a taxpayer of the Public Concession from Anhui (53 years old), who is the secretary of the Chinese Association. It is a single stone warehouse gate. Tao lives on the second floor and the lower reception room, and the third floor is rented to Dong for a monthly rent of 20 yuan. His wife, Jiang, is 37 years old and has one son and one daughter. Dong is an accountant. Before the war, he co-founded an accounting firm with accountant Jiang Wanping. After the war, he broke away from Jiang. He is now the manager of Daxing Money Shop at No. 264 Jiangxi Road and the accounting director of Datong Business Company at No. 353 on the same road.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hit by Three Shots, Died Instantly</p>
<p>He usually wears a suit, but because of the sweltering heat, he recently changed to Chinese clothes. At about 8:15 this morning, he was wearing a white Indian silk gown, spun silk trousers, white socks and satin shoes, a straw hat and glasses, and walked out of the back door. He had not walked a few steps, and had just arrived downstairs of the overpass, when two thugs were preying on the lane. When they saw him approaching, they drew their guns and shot at him. The sound of gunfire was like a continuous string of pearls. He was hit and fell to the ground, and blood splattered everywhere. One shot hit his nose and penetrated the back of his head, one hit his chest, and one hit his lower abdomen. All were vital points, and he died instantly. At that time, many people were cooling off in the lane, and they fled in panic upon hearing the gunshots, and the order was disrupted.</p>
<p>Chinese Police Bravely Captured One Bandit</p>
<p>After the thugs shot and killed, they quickly ran out of the side door of Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, towards Ximen Road. A Chinese police officer from No. 790 at the Malong Road intersection was passing by and followed them. One thug was just entering the back door of No. 17 Ximen Lane when a Chinese police officer (No. 737) standing guard at the intersection of Malong Road and Lafayette Road rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. He bravely rushed into Ximen Lane and surrounded and arrested them together. At that time, the thug saw that the situation was bad and could not advance or retreat, so he quickly drew his gun to resist arrest, trying to break through the encirclement. The two police officers drew their guns and returned fire for self-defense. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots. As a result, one thug was shot in the abdomen and fell to the ground. The two police officers quickly pounced forward, bravely seized the gun from his hand, and surrendered.</p>
<p>The Assassination Target is Someone Else</p>
<p>Later, an ambulance was urgently used to transport him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the confession, his name is Wei Gaofa, 26 years old, living on Dalishi Bailinan Road, Shanghai West. He directly admitted that he was ordered to assassinate Tao Leqin, the secretary of the "Wanted List of 83 People." However, the injured thug's abdomen was shot, and the injury was not light. The police are now tracking down another thug who is at large. Dong's body was then transported by the police to the mortuary of Talas Tuolu Road for autopsy. The court will send personnel to investigate this morning.</p>
<p>The Deceased Had No Political Activities</p>
<p>According to accounting circles, Dong was extremely loyal, amiable, and approachable in his lifetime. He graduated from the Department of Commerce and Accounting of Fudan University in his youth and had excellent knowledge. This misfortune is a pity. According to another report, the deceased's wife stated to the police that her husband was the manager of Daxing Money Shop at No. 264 Jiangxi Road, and had no enemies in ordinary times, and had never engaged in political activities. According to the confession of the arrested thug, Dong was mistakenly killed, because the person they wanted to assassinate was Tao Leqin, the secretary of the Chinese Association of Taxpayers of the Public Concession, because Tao lived in the same residence as Dong. According to the thug's confession, he now lives in Shanghai West.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong authorities are currently planning to establish a model hygiene research institute near the University of Hong Kong, which will also serve as a training center for public health. The establishment of this institute will bring immense benefits to society and promote the improvement of hygiene in China. It is reported that Sir Robert Ho Tung greatly supports this initiative and has pledged to donate 150,000 yuan towards the construction cost of approximately 500,000 yuan, to help make this great endeavor a reality. It is also said that Sir Robert Ho Tung's generous donation will further deepen the gratitude of the people of Hong Kong towards him, as this is the fourth time Mr. Ho has donated to the University of Hong Kong. In the past, he donated 100,000 yuan for the construction of the mechanical workshop of the engineering school, 50,000 yuan for the establishment of a surgical chair in the medical school, and an additional 110,000 yuan for a foundation. Therefore, including this latest donation of 150,000 yuan, the total amount donated by Mr. Ho Tung to the University of Hong Kong and other institutions has reached 410,000 yuan. As for Mr. Ho Tung's donations to other causes in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, they amount to millions.</p>

<p>A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency interviewed Mr. Bowen, the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth regarding the special police negotiations. According to Mr. Bowen, as far as he knows, all issues between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side regarding special police and taxation on roads built beyond the settlement boundaries, as well as court matters, have currently stalled and there are no new developments.</p>

<p>After the resignation of Mr. Campbell, the executive officer of the U.S. Court for China, the vacant position has been temporarily filled by Mr. Lee Chueh-sen, a renowned local lawyer, appointed by the American Judge Hellmich. This temporary appointment is due to the request of the Department of Justice, so that if there is a vacancy before the U.S. President officially appoints a successor, a suitable person can be found locally to temporarily fill the position and then wait for the government's appointment. Currently, it is difficult to predict whether the President will officially appoint Mr. Lee to the position. However, it is heard that Mr. Lee Chueh-sen is quite unwilling to officially accept the position.</p>

<h3 id="e86">A Large Number of British Women and Children Leave Hong Kong to Seek Refuge in Shanghai: Also a Significant Number of Chinese, Dutch, and Russians. The General Situation in Hong Kong Seems Peaceful. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that over 150 foreigners seeking refuge from Hong Kong arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th) at 3:00 PM aboard the Japanese ship Kamakura Maru. According to them, Hong Kong has become an armed camp. On the surface, it is still peaceful, but there is an underlying tension, and it is unclear what the future holds. Because residents fear a Japanese blockade, most have left the country.</p>
<p>Those Remaining in Hong Kong Are All Volunteers</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government is only assisting in the evacuation of British dependents. However, Chinese, Dutch, and Russians in Hong Kong are also leaving in large numbers. Those who remain in Hong Kong are all volunteers or are hindered by business and cannot evacuate. It is expected that most of the Russians in Hong Kong will also evacuate soon, with Shanghai as their primary destination.</p>
<p>Some Italians Ordered to Leave the Country</p>
<p>Among the passengers on the Kamakura Maru, there were some Italians who were detained by the Hong Kong authorities when Italy declared war and were then ordered to leave the country. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday were British women and children, as well as some Chinese, Dutch, and Russians.</p>
<p>British Women and Children Mostly Go to Fiji</p>
<p>Also, according to the North-China Daily News, about one hundred British women and children who sought refuge in Shanghai aboard the Kamakura Maru yesterday. It was said that there were originally many more who were scheduled to evacuate to Shanghai, but most changed their plans and sought refuge in Manila. Among those who came to Shanghai were about fifty Italian women whose husbands were detained in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Extremely Strict Control in Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to a British woman, the situation in Hong Kong seems quite peaceful, but the residents all know that evacuation is necessary, so there are no complaints. The Hong Kong control regulations have been greatly tightened. Even British citizens who relocate must notify the authorities, otherwise they will be severely fined. The Kamakura Maru left Hong Kong on Friday. All British women and children had to leave the country that day. They boarded the ship in a storm, but the journey to Shanghai was calm.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The French Concession's Method of Increasing Taxes Is Difficult to Change: The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Directors and Committee Members Plan to Petition the French Consul-General. <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>After the French Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council decided to increase (1) the land tax by one per mille, (2) the house tax by five percent, and (3) the surtax on various license fees and miscellaneous taxes from ten percent to fifty percent, effective July, the residents of the district, unable to bear the burden, requested the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate to maintain the status quo. According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency who inquired with the association, the association, at the request of the taxpayers, asked all the Chinese directors and committee members to discuss the matter with the Shanghai Municipal Council. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the case had already been approved by the board of directors and approved by the consulate, and it was difficult to change it. Therefore, the Chinese directors and committee members plan to petition the French Consul-General again.</p>
<p>Chiang Li-chuan Talks</p>
<p>Chiang Li-chuan, a judge of the Second Special District Court, said that the Shanghai Municipal Council increased the municipal donation and land tax from July 1st to make up for the administrative expenses that were not balanced. The big landlords and the second landlords with abundant income also took the opportunity to increase rents. According to the Civil Law Article 427, the landlord shall bear all taxes and levies on the leased property in the lease contract, regardless of whether it is a fixed-term or indefinite contract. Therefore, the increased taxes and levies should be borne by the landlord. Moreover, the lease contract is a bilateral contract, and the amount of rent has been agreed upon when the contract is concluded. Once agreed, it shall not be changed without the consent of the other party.</p>
<p>Rent Increase Restriction</p>
<p>As for Article 442 of the Civil Law, which stipulates that the parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent of real estate due to the rise or fall in its value, it is limited to indefinite leases. For fixed-term leases, rent increases are absolutely not allowed. Even according to the aforementioned legal provision, the prerequisites for increasing the rent of an indefinite lease contract must be based on the increase in the price of the real estate itself, and the parties must petition the court for a ruling. If it meets the conditions for increasing rent, it must be requested from the court, and the court shall determine the increase in proportion to the increase. It is not possible for the landlord to unilaterally notify the rent increase.</p>
<p>Unilateral Rent Increase</p>
<p>In fact, it is common for landlords to notify that the rent will be increased from a certain month and then collect it according to this amount. If the tenant is unwilling to increase the rent and pays the original amount, the landlord will either refuse to accept the original rent or directly use the newly added amount as arrears month by month, as a basis for terminating the lease contract in the future. This is a mistake. It must be known that the reason for terminating the lease contract for arrears of rent must be that the rent is "agreed". The one unilaterally set by the landlord is not agreed. Moreover, the so-called arrears must be deliberately in arrears. If the tenant is unwilling to increase the rent and pays according to the original amount, and is rejected, it is the landlord who has delayed the receipt, and the tenant is not responsible for the arrears.</p>
<p>Legislative Original Purpose</p>
<p>In short, the current civil law of our country is based on the society, and all rights and obligations must be freely exercised under the common interests of the society. The ruling of the judge is also based on this as a reasonable scope. In the past, colleagues in the legal profession have made considerable efforts in this regard to prevent the increasingly dire life of the public. The citizens of Shanghai should also think about the people's livelihood, look forward to the difficulties of the times, share the responsibility of being in the same boat in the storm, and take the righteousness of human coexistence, and encourage themselves to be vigilant and restrain their selfish desires. This is the greatest hope.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the American transport ship USS Chaumont is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 28 from San Diego, carrying troops to replace the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai. The ship will only dock in Shanghai for one day and then go to Qinhuangdao, returning to Shanghai around August 15, stopping briefly before sailing back to the United States. Also, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet destroyer tender USS Black Hawk is expected to arrive in Shanghai on August 20 for a short stay. The rumor that the American ships USS Augusta or USS Marblehead will return to Shanghai at the end of this week has not been confirmed by the U.S. Navy in this city.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association held a joint meeting of representatives yesterday and resolved the following important matters: (1) The previous meeting resolved to continue holding the 7th low-price coal briquette sale from the 11th to the 20th of this month. The number of low-price coal briquettes was previously determined by ten factories including Yitai Hing and Nanyang. Now, please have each participating factory list the low-price sale locations on the spot for implementation. It was resolved that forty locations are planned to be set up in the two concessions, and the detailed addresses will be announced after sorting. (2) Regarding the proposal to stipulate the number of coal briquettes to be purchased and the price, it was resolved that each person will still be limited to purchasing 30 cents per day, totaling 5 catties of coal briquettes.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Will Meet Today to Stabilize the People's Food Supply: It Is Expected That the Price Can Be Suppressed After the Production Industry Evaluation. A Large Amount of Imported Rice Arrives, and the Sales Market Relaxes <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In order to discuss concrete measures and stabilize the overall people's food supply, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession specifically scheduled to convene a joint meeting with the French Concession Shanghai Municipal Council at 2:30 PM today to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the Shanghai people's food supply, and invited rice industry leaders such as Chen Ziyi to attend the meeting and discuss. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council has discussed the measures to stabilize the Shanghai people's food supply, and after the formal revision and approval, all will be implemented. Therefore, the panic of the people's food supply in this city seems to have been curbed to some extent.</p>
<p>Today's Evaluation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held its first evaluation committee meeting at its office at No. 15 Edward Road at 3:30 PM this afternoon. The committee decided to lower the price of rice and decided to send a letter to the Shanghai People's Food Supply Adjustment Association, requesting it to continue its efforts to handle group purchases of rice, and to promptly forward letters to various organs, groups, and schools to actively participate, and to carry out the rice industry's automatic group purchase of rice to be transported to Shanghai for storage, increasing the inventory.</p>
<p>Association Orders</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai People's Food Supply Adjustment Association convened a standing committee meeting on the 28th of last month to revise the method of ordering imported rice, all parties have been extremely enthusiastic in entrusting the association to order. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the groups that have entrusted the association to order rice in recent days include the rickshaw mutual aid association and the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. It is expected that the first batch of about 2,000 bags of imported rice can be ordered from Saigon within the next week. However, because the purchasers only pay a deposit of 40 yuan per bag of imported rice, and there are still about 25 yuan of advances, it is bound to be raised by the association. It is estimated that the first batch of rice orders will be about 60,000 bags, so the association is preparing to raise the advance funds. It is heard that the fundraising method is still the same as before, all of which are borrowed by the standing committee members of the association, or borrowed from outside in a private way by the standing committee members. However, the amount of funds this time is not large, so there should be no problem. The imported rice is temporarily limited to secondary rice. Some groups only pay a deposit of 20 yuan, and the association has issued special letters urging them to pay double the deposit, which must be paid in full by the middle of this month at the latest.</p>
<p>Rice Arrives Next Week</p>
<p>In recent days, speculative merchants have used the excuse of tense situation and the difficulty of importing rice as a false statement in an attempt to raise the market price. In fact, the source of imported rice in Hong Kong and other places has been very smooth in recent days.

<p>The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute announced the estimated output of summer and winter crops in fourteen provinces, including Zhejiang, Min, Ning, Qing, Gan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Henan, this year: (1) The summer crop harvest was abundant due to the even distribution of rainfall and good crop growth. The average for each province is about 70% of a full year; (2) The preliminary estimate for winter crops is that the area of winter crops has increased due to the government's promotion of winter cultivation, encouragement of increased production, and high prices of agricultural products. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Summer</p>

<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, regarding the large number of resignations from the Public Concession Police Department, the Shanghai Municipal Council officials remain silent. However, it is heard that the number of resignations submitted by personnel in the Police Department this year has exceeded 80. According to a police officer, most of the resigned personnel want to</p>
<p>Go to Europe to Join the Army</p>
<p>However, low-ranking personnel in the Police Department said that they are quite dissatisfied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's treatment of pensions. A police officer said that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not explain the pension matters, which shows that the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Lacks Trust in Officers</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department allows police officers to withdraw their pensions, but the Shanghai Municipal Council has not made any statements to the officers. Moreover, the officers are also dissatisfied with long-term leave. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's current restrictions, long-term leave for officers has been cancelled. Those who have reached the vacation period can spend six weeks in the East. This method is indeed not bad, but the Shanghai Municipal Council does not subsidize travel expenses, so those who want to take a vacation must pay their own expenses.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the Italian racial discrimination order has been extended to Shanghai. The Italian authorities in this city have banned Italian naval and army personnel stationed in Shanghai from entering Jewish cafes in Hongkou, and "unless absolutely necessary and unavoidable," they must not have any commercial dealings with Jews in this city. Italian expatriates in Shanghai received this order at the end of last week. When Italian officials answered reporters' questions, they neither commented on this order nor stated its details. In the past few months, sailors from the Italian gunboats Liburn and Calrotto have been frequenting cafes set up by German Jews in Hongkou, and the business has been booming. However, after the Italian authorities implemented the "racial ban," on Saturday and Sunday last week, cafes set up by Jewish mixed people were</p>
<p>Devoid of Italian Soldiers</p>
<p>So the business was deserted. It is heard that the Italian soldiers stationed in Shanghai now only go to a few places in the southern part of the Public Concession at night. The Italian authorities have designated the Dahua Theater and the Dahua Cafe as places where Italian soldiers can go for entertainment.</p>

<p>Nothing is more broad and perfect in the Buddha's teaching, reaching the most noble realm, than the Avatamsaka Sutra. This Sutra has greatly influenced the national character of our country, and the annotations written by National Master Qingliang of the Tang Dynasty are even more outstanding among the ancient and modern works on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Unfortunately, there have been no good editions for publication, and it is a matter of regret for those who recite, study, and research it. Layman Xu Weiru once made a great vow to edit and print a complete edition, but he passed away before he could begin. Now, the Venerable Master Yingci, along with Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Ye Yufu, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang, and Mr. Fei Youxi, have specially joined forces to take on the task. For a time, domestic and foreign</p>

Now, the cost of paper and labor is increasing day by day, but they still do not flinch slightly. When the entire book is printed in the future, the actual labor cost will be calculated. The fifth board meeting was convened in this city the day before yesterday. Fei Huimao, Jiang Yizhen, Guan Jiongzhi, Qian Chongzhi, Li Yuanjin, Shi Shengzhi, Xu Chunrong, Meng Wangqu, Yue Jing, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Zhang Zhifang, Yingci, Wu, and Wang Qiumei attended the meeting and reported on the</p>

(2) The old carved scripture place in Peiping, previously handled by Director Jiang Zhuzhuang, borrowed funds to Songzang Yizhen as a printing copy. It has now agreed to allocate it to this association as a printing copy, that is,</p>
<p>The price of Songzang Yizhen will be used for consignment sales and receipts. (3) There are more than ten kinds of publications for the collation of the Avatamsaka Sutra text and the annotation text of this association. Each layman is responsible for the fine proofreading. Each publication has been compared word by word from beginning to end. If there are differences, further verification and selection will be added, and the meeting will be reorganized. It is expected that the proofreading work can be completed by the end of the year. As for verification and organization, it will not be completed until the end of next year. It was originally intended to be released early, but in accordance with the proofreading example,</p>

<p>And there are many proofreading copies, due to the early publication, this association has accumulated donations. In addition to allocating typesetting fees, we can first inquire about the prices of handmade Maobian paper from various paper shops or entrust people to inquire in the paper-producing areas. If there is a suitable opportunity, and the original estimated cost is not very different, we will purchase and store it at any time.</p>

<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, remittances from overseas Chinese to the country have increased year by year. According to the authorities in charge of overseas Chinese affairs, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese to the motherland last year reached 600 million yuan. In addition, from the outbreak of the war until the end of December last year, the relief donations and charitable donations donated by overseas Chinese had reached 124 million yuan, not including the purchase of various government bonds and other special donations. Since the spread of the European War, remittances from overseas Chinese to the country have become more enthusiastic. According to financial circles, remittances from overseas Chinese in May and June recently, which were remitted to the free zone of the motherland via Hong Kong, have been consistently around 50 million yuan per month. Most of them are remitted to major inland cities such as Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and Chengdu for the needs of developing industries and establishing factories. Overseas Chinese have seen that the currency system of foreign countries has changed drastically during the First World War, but investing in the motherland's production industry can not only guarantee safety, but also fulfill the responsibility of the citizens.</p>

<p>A Pacific typhoon has begun to strike the Chinese coast. The winds are strong, and the observatory and customs are closely monitoring it. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory, the Pacific typhoon, after crossing the Taiwan Strait, began to head towards Fuzhou. It reached 25 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude at six o'clock yesterday morning. The center of the wind force was within 60 nautical miles, and the wind was quite strong, moving rapidly in a west-northwest direction.</p>
<p>Four Wind Forces as Outpost Disturbance</p>
<p>According to the above-reported position, the typhoon is southeast of Fuzhou, about 60 nautical miles away. Therefore, the weather in Fuzhou has been affected by the "wind tongue," with cyclones and rainstorms. According to the observatory's report yesterday morning, there were already four wind forces in Fuzhou, obviously the disturbance of the typhoon's outpost.</p>
<p>Afternoon Report</p>
<p>The observatory issued a second report at 2 p.m., stating that the typhoon had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 120 nautical miles. According to the above-reported position, the typhoon has swept past the west of Fuzhou, about 100 nautical miles away, and continued to move in a north-northwest direction.</p>
<p>Shanghai Also Affected by Tentacles</p>
<p>As for this port, there were also strong winds and showers starting yesterday morning. Whether it will be attacked by the typhoon is being closely monitored by the observatory and Jianghai Customs. Ships sailing from Shanghai to various ports in South China have also received warnings from the Customs to suspend sailing. In the afternoon, scattered clouds swept by, and whirlwinds carried rain, stopping and starting intermittently, also affected by the typhoon's tentacles.</p>
<p>Another Typhoon Follows</p>
<p>Finally, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory, while a strong typhoon was approaching the Chinese coast, a new typhoon arose in the Pacific Ocean. At 6 a.m. yesterday morning, its position was 12 degrees north latitude and 141 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 120 nautical miles, heading west-northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Sailing Schedules Postponed <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The new typhoon is approaching the waters off the Ryukyu Islands. According to a report from the observatory received by the Customs yesterday, the current position of the typhoon is 26 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude, with a wind force of 120. The wind direction is north-northwest. According to those familiar with navigation, the wind force of this new typhoon, 120, is not very strong. If the wind direction does not change and remains north-northwest, this city may not be hit head-on. However, if it deviates slightly to the west, it will be difficult to avoid. Due to the typhoon, the sailing schedules of import and export ships in this city have changed. The Ruitai, a Chinese ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 4 p.m. yesterday, has been postponed. Whether it can leave today depends on the wind. The Shantai, of the Zhengde Company, was also scheduled to sail to Ningbo at 4 p.m. yesterday, but due to insufficient loading, it was scheduled to be delayed until about 8 p.m. It is feared that it will only anchor at the mouth of the Huangpu River to wait for the typhoon to pass before sailing to Ningbo. The Yusheng of Jardine Matheson, coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong, was expected to arrive at 4 p.m. yesterday but has now changed to enter the port this morning. The Shengjing of Taikoo &amp; Co., returning to Shanghai from the Beiyang, may not be able to enter the port today. There was no definite news yesterday. All ship schedule changes are automatic, and the Customs has not issued any notifications.</p>

They seized thousands of yuan in cash and a bank deposit book worth 1,000 yuan. However, the main criminals, Zhu Zhenglong and Li Jinzhang, had already escaped upon hearing the news, and the firearms and other weapons had also been moved away, so they were not seized. The French Concession Police conducted an</p>

<p>and learned that in July of last year, Wang Deqing, Wang Shaoting, Chen Shouheng, Zu Guanghua, Zhu Zhenglong, and Li Jinzhang killed an old man, Shen Ganting, by shooting him with a gun in the wilderness near Tongwen College on Hongqiao Road. Also, in January of this year, they robbed more than 1,000 yuan from a milk shop on Gu Shenfu Road and a Tiansheng cloth store on Anna Jin Road. They were all sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, and public prosecutions were filed against the defendants on charges of murder and robbery. After trial by Judge Zhang Minsheng, Ge Ziyu, Ge Wangshi, Yuan Zhangshi, Li Wangshi, and four others were found to have no involvement and were ordered to be released without prosecution. When questioning the remaining defendants, their statements were evasive. However, the first to fifth defendants were notorious bandits in the Anhui gang, nicknamed "Five Rats." The case was</p>

<p>Visiting the Scenic Huahu Lake</p>
<p>Huahu Lake is a famous scenic spot in Hangzhou. In the past, it was listed as one of the Eighteen Views and was greatly appreciated by the literati and scholars of the time. Tourists were also very numerous for a while. Today, if you ask the people of Hangzhou, few can know its location. However, the villagers outside the city still know it, and they commonly call it "Huahu Li." If you only mention the name of the lake, they will be at a loss. According to its location near Liuxia, the lake is not very large or deep, but it has the beauty of nine bends and thirteen bays. There are many nunneries nearby, more than ten of which are famous, all with clear flowers and bamboos, and quiet waters and rocks. Entering them makes one feel leisurely and want to renounce the world, making it the best place for those who enjoy tranquility and practice Zen. Peng Xueqin, a Vice Minister, was convalescing at West Lake and often indulged in the beauty of the mountains and waters. He would take a bamboo cane and go wherever his fancy took him. On the twenty-third of last month, he invited Huang Wenzong and Yu Zhangjiao to visit Huahu Lake together. For a time, their attendants were unaware of what Huahu Lake was. When they asked the boatmen, they finally learned. The three gentlemen rode together in a small melon-peel boat, rowing towards it. Drifting in the middle of the stream, they felt like immortals. Because the harbor there is winding and winding, the painted boats and larger ships in West Lake cannot enter. The three gentlemen drank wine and composed poetry in the boat. Those who knew them envied them as celestial beings, enjoying clear blessings and leisure, lamenting that they could not reach them. The scenic spot of Huahu Lake has long been forgotten by tourists and has been desolate. Since the visit of the three dignitaries, the people of Hangzhou have talked about its name. This is indeed a great fortune for Huahu Lake!</p>

<p>Speaking of street children, some people's memories will be evoked with some disgusting faces, ragged clothes, and annoying impressions of crying with their bellies held. But who has ever noticed that many street children, although their faces are full of dirt, cannot hide the naturally adorable and upright contours of their faces; although their clothes are so broken, sometimes their little feet are casually crossed or tapping without any restraint, also reveal the beauty of their upright posture when standing. These are not worthy of our attention, and even more precious is their inner beauty - a beautiful soul. They are not inherently rude and ill-mannered, without a sense of shame, willing to beg for pity, or fond of scolding people. It's just that everything around them has long been destined. Their arrival in the world is not about living, without enjoyment, only suffering, being squeezed to death by the environment - because if there is no luck from heaven falling on their heads, 99 percent of these street children have no hope of "rebirth."</p>
<p>Here I want to introduce some so-called street children, but they no longer evoke your disgusting impression. Adorable, honest, selfless, intelligent, these pure descriptive words are only worthy of describing them. These street children are all those I met in the shelters after the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to mention Hao. He has a round face, not tall, about twelve years old, and is the most exquisite. He is the best at speaking, and his words are the most vivid. He is the most able to use exaggerated words to describe things, so his words are the most pleasant to listen to. He also has a high-pitched voice. When he sings the Great Sword March "Great sword to...", it is the most exciting, but when he sings "We are all homeless wanderers...", everyone will be deeply moved. He also loves to take a short stick, tilt his head, and act as the conductor of a large chorus. Many times he is adorable.</p>
<p>Gui is a thin, long child. When he smiles, he often reveals his yellow teeth, but this does not make him seem unadorable. He responds the most fluently. I often see him running barefoot in their simple classroom. I ask, "Gui! Why don't you wear shoes?" He answers directly and frankly: "Where are the shoes?" These vanities of pretending to make people happy have not yet entered his mind. He has no parents. In the shelter, he takes care of everything himself. Many times, he also helps others. It is said that he has learned Shenqu in order to make a living in the future.</p>
<p>A Si is an honest child. His honesty can be known just by looking at his face. He likes to talk about family matters, and he likes to say many words of advice to others. When I parted with them, he shed sincere tears several times.</p>
<p>Are these all manifestations of wildness? There are many, many more children who are so good that they just want people to know what the essence of street children is.</p>
<p>Now it is the summer vacation. Junior and senior high school students can make use of the empty school buildings to run summer schools. This is a practical test for those who love education and pedagogy. Not only do street children get the benefits, but also general students can get another kind of knowledge. There are also elementary school teachers who are idle during the summer vacation who can do this work.</p>
<p>If it is just running this kind of volunteer school every year during the summer or winter vacation, I don't think it is very appropriate. There should be some institutions or enthusiastic benefactors who organize it on a large scale. Because what street children lack is not only education, but also the food to maintain life. They cannot receive education without clothes or food on an empty stomach, because people are, after all, people. What street children need is teaching and nurturing! Therefore, only teaching and nurturing can be done simultaneously to save street children.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Nostalgia for the Sea <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfeng</p>
<p>Like often thinking about friends traveling far away, I often think about the sea of my hometown! The great and solemn soul of the motherland.</p>
<p>But now, my relationship with the sea seems to have exceeded the level of "thinking about it." I can't restrain my excessive concern and love for her, as well as the feelings of distress and worry because of her. It's a sublimation of "thinking about it," like the feeling of a young and passionate child tasting the sweet juice of love for the first time?</p>
<p>In the early red pomegranate flower season, I started dreaming, and it was about [the sea]:</p>
<p>"...Several young people we often run into, after eating the last piece of bread at a picnic, we saw the sea stretching out her hot hand to come over. Her posture was bold and unrestrained, but with some impatience. She kissed those shining and happy shells on the shallows. She also blew that familiar whistle. My friends ran over to welcome her. We received a kiss on her smooth hand, and we embraced her waist warmly. However, surprise occupied everyone's heart. We all felt that she had become thinner, but after a while, we all understood: for three years, her children, her home had been humiliated. She was depressed, anxious, and angry. So she became thinner!"</p>
<p>"Then, we sang a magnificent song in unison; just like we sang three years ago. The sea finally trembled and smiled. She sang with us. Our singing spread to the far, far sea. We heard echoes rushing from the islands..."</p>
<p>Now the pomegranate flowers are old, but my nostalgia will be even more intense! Today, I accidentally passed by the window of a certain company, and I saw a distant view of the seabed, and girls wearing beautiful swimsuits on the shallows. My heart was strongly shaken again. Is this sarcasm? For a child who is nostalgic for the sea but cannot see the sea?</p>
<p>I hope that under the bright moonlight tonight, I will relive a sweet dream of the seabed - reality is bitter, only dreams, you give me comfort.</p>

<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>In the darkness, young people bravely grope, their hands pierced, and their faces scraped. Fresh blood drips down in spots; but the young people do not shrink back. Pain is a precious companion of the young people, and the flower of hope blooms in the hearts of the young people....</p>
<p>The cunning of people once frustrated the hearts of young people. A world is full of hypocrisy and deceit! But young people are immediately encouraged by a new faith: a new world of light and justice is waiting for us young people to create!</p>
<p>Young people have no curses, let alone complaints. The physique of young people is as strong as their will. Young people create their valuable experiences everywhere. They know that experience should be a powerful tool on the journey of life, without which they will not reach the glorious throne of success.</p>
<p>Young people are the happiest people in the world, right? Licentious and dissolute young people should know that they have made a losing transaction, throwing a gem like gravel in a garbage heap!</p>
<p>Do not fail the mission of young people, for young people are the handymen of all work!</p>

<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>Night. The electric light suddenly broke. I lit a plain candle. The silent room matched a dim color, with a strange flavor.</p>
<p>The candlelight flickers. Why can't my heart be at peace? Falling into the atmosphere of tranquility, the tentacles of thinking disturb my mood, losing balance.</p>
<p>Life is tempering, but people are often too fragile to endure the torment of emotions. So I ask for an indifferent heart. Reality is cruel, it gives young people a period of suffering and troubled years. So I learn to be cold.</p>
<p>But tonight, I can't control my purple thoughts again.</p>
<p>A friend encountered some misfortune in the world. But he said lightly: "I don't cry or laugh, there is no shame or pride. I use my own shoulders to bear the heavy gate of "fate". In a series of days, people have to grasp the inevitability." I answered him with the greatest praise and admiration.</p>
<p>The electric light came on unexpectedly. The excessive light was a bit dazzling. But people's mood has also brightened a lot.</p>
<p>Life is tempering. The days of fire will eventually forge a strong and unparalleled new generation. I have conviction again.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 Opposing Information</p>
<p>"The earrings?"</p>
<p>"She has several pairs of earrings, a pair of emeralds, a pair of diamonds, and a pair of annual pearl earrings. However, she does not necessarily wear earrings when she goes out."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "I believe she must have worn earrings last night."</p>
<p>Jinmei said, "I didn't pay attention to which pair she was wearing."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly interjected and asked, "When you first discovered her last night, did she have any jewelry on her hands and ears?"</p>
<p>Jinmei hesitated and said, "I - I didn't think about this, I didn't look closely, probably not. Because since then, no one else has come except Miss Jiang. Later it was this -" Her eyes looked at Ni Jinshou.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied, "Later, I came. Right?...Then, after she came back last night, would she have taken off her jewelry herself?" This last sentence seemed to be asking himself.</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly answered automatically: "I don't think so. After she came back, she didn't even change her muddy high heels, so she would never take off her jewelry first. Look, her pair of Huzhi-style slippers were originally under the bench."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou glanced casually in the direction where I was sitting, and asked Jinmei, "Where is her jewelry kept? We can understand as long as we check it."</p>
<p>Jinmei pointed to the light blue painted iron box. "There is a small jewelry box in this iron box."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou put in the pencil and leaned his body forward, looking as if he was about to stand up, but unexpectedly, there was a small interruption. (39)</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Mission of Cinema <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Cinema has the mission of exposing sin, praising loyalty and martyrdom, criticizing current affairs, and enlightening knowledge, because the deep emotion of cinema can make sad people happy, and also make happy people sad. It can make irritable people amiable, and also make decadent people invigorated. Directly and indirectly, it has the power to influence society, which cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>The most reasonable treatment for the mentally ill, according to the statistics of the Hollywood Cinema Reformation Institute in 1936: of 1,987 mentally ill patients, more than 8.2% were completely reformed and cured by cinema. When the police find a mentally ill person or send them to the hospital voluntarily, the Reformation Institute immediately conducts a strict examination, distinguishing between various morbid states such as sexual, ideological, and behavioral, and reforming them according to their morbid state and degree. For example, for those suffering from sexual mental illness, in addition to equipping the ward with various books and models about sex to subtly influence them, they will be shown thirty minutes of films about sexual distress, sexual liberation, and then return to sexual shackles and sexual knowledge before getting up in the morning and before going to bed, so that they can be in contact with it day and night, and soon a kind of corrective force will naturally occur. The power of cinema can reform the mentally ill, and its great mission and its relationship to the interests of society can be imagined.</p>
<p>Therefore, cinema itself cannot lack literature and art. Literature is writing, which is synonymous with beauty. Art is work, which is exquisite technique. Cinema is a tool, and literature and art are the crystallization of intelligence. If there is only shadow without writing, and only skill without art, even if the whole film is made, its emptiness is really equal to blank paper! What's more, how can "folk films" that teach obscenity and evil, and pick up small books and ballads that are only harmful for entertainment be filmed?</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai film companies have been competing to film so-called "folk films." We sincerely hope that they can truly take on the mission of cinema, and truly pay attention to the function of cinema itself.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Chaplin's New Film "The Dictator" <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>— Shanghai Audiences Have No Luck to Appreciate</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's new political satire "The Dictator", with German leader Hitler as the subject of the depiction, the film after more than two years of production, has now been fully completed, Chaplin is a world-class artist, his works can grab the largest number of audiences wherever they are screened. But "The Dictator" may be an exception, not because Chaplin's art is insufficient to call, but because the world situation has changed drastically, and some markets cannot screen his works. According to a Mr. who manages Western films, the film will not be able to be screened in Shanghai. Recall that during the conflict between Germany and France in May, "Smashing the Nazi Spy Network" was able to pass in the French Concession. However, today Germany and France are on the same front, and there is no reason to screen "The Dictator". As for the Public Concession, the British and American positions would not prohibit the film, but the Public Concession never takes sides. "Smashing the Nazi Spy Network" is still on the prohibited list, let alone "The Dictator". It is also said that Hollywood has produced several anti-Nazi films, because some filmmakers are either Jewish or sympathetic to Jews, but none of them will be screened in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Thoughts After Seeing "The Female Innkeeper" <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>In a hotel, live Police Chief Ma Youfu, Tax Bureau Chief Kang Ti, and Regiment Commander Feng Shaohao. The hotel owner, Miss Du Jiu, is a beautiful and charming young woman, very likable. Therefore, those noble figures disregard their status and pursue her. Moreover, they do so fervently and unconsciously, one boasting of power, the other boasting of wealth, as if they have the ideal assurance of winning her favor. But what about her? She just humors them, disliking them all. Among them, Regiment Commander Feng Shaohao, because he never approaches women and even has an impolite attitude towards them, is the one that interests her. She wants to conquer this kind of man, so she uses her clever methods to finally make him waver, bewitched by her magic. As a result, just as conflicts arise among their selfish desires, she announces to them that she is marrying Fan Sheng, a servant in the hotel, because she understands that only she and Fan Sheng are a faithful couple. Finally, she demands that they immediately move out of the hotel.</p>
<p>This is the story of "The Female Innkeeper." Dramatically, the performance of "The Female Innkeeper" is full of humor and satire, like a mirror, reflecting the general truth and falsehood of the old social system.</p>
<p>Tang Ruoying's Du Jiu is fluent and natural in both speech and movement. In the second section of the second act, she uses a psychological sketch to portray the conquest of Feng Shaohao, combining seriousness with humor in a way that is very pleasing. Zhou Chu's Feng Shaohao delivers a foolish performance, which is quite successful. The sections of being bewitched by Du Jiu's false intentions and courtship are performed in a way that enhances the comedic atmosphere. Shao Hua's Ma Youfu seems to be performed as a clown. The various scenes of borrowing money and drinking, although lively, seem unreasonable considering the character's status in the play. Fan's Kang Ti has extremely lifelike facial makeup. The final duel scene is performed quite tightly. The rest, such as Ren Quan's Fan Sheng and Chen Yulin's Wang Er, are all competent.</p>
<p>In summary, we can accept this comedy; however, after it makes us laugh, we must use reason to analyze the intention behind it.</p>

<p>"I need to get married!" That's what Hollywood hotshot James Stewart said. Indeed, a young man of his age should get married, and his partners who lived with him have all left to get married, how can James not be envious!</p>
<p>Although his love life has been more extensive than others, with several famous actresses such as Virginia Bruce, Loretta Young, Ginger Rogers, Marlene Dietrich, Norma Shearer, Simone Simon, and Sonja Henie having once been involved with him, none of them can be considered as his life partner. According to James himself, "Although I hope to get married, if a woman doesn't meet my ideal, then I would rather not get married for the rest of my life. Among the many colleagues I know, only Margaret Sullavan is my ideal, but she is already a married woman."</p>
<p>Ah, "a woman like Margaret Sullavan"! James's friends are all paying attention for him. Finally, a friend named Leland Hayward found James's ideal woman, who is the beautiful Olivia de Havilland.</p>
<p>This rapid romance surprised every movie person in Hollywood. After Olivia returned from England, she became even more enthusiastic with James Stewart. James also proposed to her, and she did not refuse. So this wedding is likely to be certain.</p>
<p>"Marriage is the most important thing in life. If I had to choose between career and family, I would unhesitatingly say family." This is what Miss Olivia de Havilland said to one of her close friends. So if anyone objects to her marrying James Stewart, it certainly won't be effective.</p>

<p>— Chen Qiu</p>
<p>One often hears literary youths say: "Those who cannot read original works are like infants; when masterpieces are not translated, it's as painful as infants not being fed." Recently, one often hears friends who love drama say: "It would be great to see more foreign plays. Western masterpieces are indeed more perfect in all aspects." Yes, but in Shanghai, it's difficult to see Westerners perform plays. To be honest, there aren't even many translated scripts.</p>
<p>Only a few adapted masterpieces have been popular on stage for a while, such as "Resurrection," "The Investigating Magistrate," "The Beginning of Man," and so on.</p>
<p>"The Beginning of Man" is a masterpiece by Barclay, adapted by Gu Zhongyi. Because the standard is very high, it is not easy to grasp the performance, so it is rarely seen in amateur performances.</p>
<p>Recently, students from Huaguang Drama School have been using the summer vacation to prepare for a public performance of "The Beginning of Man," with the student union in charge of all the work. They are very enthusiastic about their work, which is common for students of the "Drama School." It is said that it has been decided to perform "The Beginning of Man" at the Russian Art Theatre on July 11, directed by Gege, with Chen Mingdong as the stage manager. Because they have a teacher-student relationship with the students of Huaguang, they are also working very hard. It is expected that this public performance will have a considerable degree of success.</p>
