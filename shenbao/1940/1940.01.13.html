<p>社評</p>
<h3>充溢市塲的和平風說</h3>
<p>近數日來，上海市塲上時常流傳着關於中日和平的種種風說：其中尤爲一般做沒本錢生意的先生們所欣欣樂道的：莫如說英國及其他數國大使先後到重慶，是帶了日本媾和條件而去勸解的；又說銀行家得到倫敦電報，中日講和已有眉目了；又說倫敦市塲上的中國債券市價飛漲，因爲和平條件已經講妥；又說外國人認爲和平立即實現，所以香港資金逃回上海了。種種說法，離奇至於近乎神秘，而健談者鑿鑿言之。他們對於國家當然不是懷着什麼惡意，不是所謂破壞抗戰意識，祇是希望在夾縫之中，獲致偶然的買賣好機會。</p>
<p>投機者決非　武主義的信徒，決非和平運動的支柱，但願現狀發生變化而他獨得風聲之先。因此之故，投機者足跡所到的地方，尤如市塲，凡百傳說，不負責任，不求準確，非但不能謂空穴來風，必有原因。抑且每每恰與事實相反；若根據市塲「電報」而認爲殆有幾分眞相，便上當了。市塲傳說又不足以視爲反映一般心理，以爲市塲上如此眉飛色舞，可見人心嚮往之甚；因爲他們所眉飛色舞者爲了買賣，不是爲了什麼和或戰。</p>
<p>在種種風說流傳之下，却亦使不在市塲的人們聞而惶惑。疑是疑非，奔走相問。其實和戰大局，不容絲毫詭異，關鍵異常簡明。不必問，不必說，祗要睜着眼睛看前綫，看重慶與東京。戰在前綫，故必前綫不復有戰訉，纔是和平的朕兆。交戰的發號司令者在重慶與東京，故必重慶與東京雙方聲明息戰言和，或一方承認戰敗求和，纔是和平的開始。此外，無論何地，如倫敦，華盛頓，日內瓦，或北平南京，儘充溢了和平空氣，還是無濟；因爲主持和戰的不在彼而在重慶東京。無論何人，主張和平，運動和平，勸導和平，若非重慶與東京接受，還是無濟，而祗是主張，運動，勸導罷了。和戰不是姿態而是行動，不是意見而是事實，不是好惡愛憎，不是是非的贊成或反對，而是事實行動的取舍從違。覷透了這一點，必不復爲任何風說而惶惑。</p>
<p>誰愛戰？其實無一人愛戰。有戰必有和，故必有一日言和。有以戰爭爲機會而漁利的人，然而惟有整個的公道的永遠和平，纔能以最大福利給予最多數人。這數點，可信爲顚撲不破的事理！準此事理，可以對於各種風說，各種幻變，各種醞釀，各種局勢，加以確當的檢定。可以對於現狀，知所努力。努力於現狀之下，不在夾縫中攫取買賣的好機會；消極言之，必須忍受犧牲，庶幾把握了戰爭以爭得整個而公追的永遠和平；積極言之，必須勒勞節儉，庶幾積聚犧牲所餘的力量，準備着整個而公道的永遠和平實現後之復興偉業。近日市塲上的風說，不値一顧；近日日本在彼國際上內政上軍事上繼續不斷的暴露弱點，却反襯了中國前途的無限光明，且暗示不了光明的期不在遠。惟其如此，不但可以預言利用戰爭而投機漁利的人們，危機當頭，末日來臨；亦且肯定了勤勞節儉自是重要信條！</p>
<h3>日本國內外情勢嚴重　阿部內閣勢在必倒　首相繼任人選銓衡困難　近衛表示不願重作馮婦</h3>
<p>東京　首相阿部旣確將於一二日內辭職、全國人士乃往視重臣設法覓取一平民越等政治家願意並力能組成舉國一致的內閣者之活動、聞軍部力促近衛冉度出任相職、惟聞近衛表示不願、據近衛今日聲稱、有許多人來訪、囑其担任此職、但彼等目的各不相同、依渠意見、「中國事件』之解決必須與國內政策同時併進、惟目前政治與經濟之狀况旣已如是、故渠以爲國內政策有予以更大注意之必要、無疑的目前形勢較渠前任相職時更爲困難、渠不知今後可否不愈臻困難云、衆望新首相無論爲誰、能組成可應付長期戰爭之內閣、並屬望新首相成立以戰時經濟爲根據之有力的經濟與實業制度、現有出任首相之可能者、為日本銀行前總栽池田在彬·前任陸相荒木·前任　密大臣鈴木貫太郎·前任首相平沼·與前任首相廣田弘毅諸人、前相兼陵相宇垣一成則未被提出、聞軍部已表示意見、不宜以現役軍人担任此席、預料阿部將於星期晨或星期一日舉行內閣特會後、即行辭職、而後重臣將召集會議以決定職任人選、參加此會議者、大都爲曾任首相之人、「日日新聞」稱、金融界現正作愼重之注視、並信如不早日採取固定日常生活必需品最低接濟之政策、則貨幣與物價問題勢將愈形嚴重、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>東京　阿部首相於今日閣議舉行之後、對各閣僚表示其最後的決意、午後進宮、與湯淺內府會見、亦向內府表示此決意、然依目前形勢而觀、則前首相近衛公爵之動靜、實爲　般注目之的、軍部方面之全體意見、希望山近衛公爵圖謀政局之一新、事變之處理、以及國內經濟體制之强化、軍部爲貫澈此希望起見、似將堅持努力、且此不僅爲軍部方面之努力、即如重臣方面亦對近衛公爵致同樣之期待、據傳湯淺內府曾將此意、率直向近衛公爵表示、平沼男爵亦對政界上層部力說、欲收拾時局、捨近衛公爵外無他人云云、至政黨財界方面雖亦有二三其他候補者、然鑒於軍部及重要方面之意旨如此、故期望近衛出馬之聲、亦逐漸高亢、在此情勢之下、以近衛公爲中心之各方面之活動已益趨活躍、然近衛本人則對僵局之打開、多少懷抱危懼之念、出馬與否不無感到躊躇、能否順應各方面幾乎一致之期望、尙爲疑問、然公爵之進退、大的在此一二日內可以決定也、（十二日同盟社電）</p>

<h3>犯奧日軍拉伕暴行　南海三水花縣備極騷擾廣州先後被拉去數萬人</h3>
<p>廣州通信、犯粤日軍、邇因兵源缺乏、無法補充、加以妄圖窺犯韶關、故竟大舉拉伕、以資驅使、惟被拉者大都不服、以致慘劇迭見發生、茲紀情形如下、</p>
<p>各屬方面</p>
<p>九江太平等地日軍、由十二月上旬起、在吉贊大岡墟等地强拉農民百餘後、連日仍不時出現各鄉、　遇牧童、及在田地沙坦工作之農民、必追捕拉返軍部、際此收割時期、農民以生活關係、不得不拚命割禾、每遇日軍一至、則棄穀逃避、間有逃避不及而被拉者、計自十八至二十日間、南海各地已被拉去三百餘人、三水方面、當大滘市·西城市等市集期間、鄉民多趁墟、詎日軍忽至、將墟包圍、遇有年壯靑年即拉去、一時人民爭相逃避、商店忙於關門、秩序爲之大亂、計大滘市被拉去五十餘人、西城市拉去三十餘人、日軍將被拉者用長繩繫手、押返太平方面、而九江日艇、亦常駛至沙頭咀·周村埗頭·龍池歐香等滋擾、刻下南三兩縣各地、鶴唳風聲、居民無日不陷於恐怖狀態中、又廣花公路綫之泥城·蕭崗一帶、亦曾被日軍大捕各鄉壯年男女、附近華軍葉部便衣隊聆訊、即分四路將泥城等處緊密圍襲、日軍突遭殲擊、急向西村方面逃竄、遺棄步槍數十桿、死傷數十、華方僅犧牲數人、事後日軍竄至泥城、藉名搜查遊擊隊、在附近各鄕捕去民衆數十返市拷訊、現日軍對於該地區各鄉、戒備異常森嚴、</p>
<p>廣州方面</p>
<p>日軍拉募伕役、自開始迄今、將達一月、拉慕名額、統計已達數萬人、需求無量、故拉之亦無盡、廣州市民、因此多不敢出戶、市面更呈蕭索荒凉景象、近以市內無人可拉、乃轉在各鄉區乘墟期市集之際、前往拉募、以致附近各鄕區墟期市集、亦槪暫停舉行、惟以日軍日常需用伕役名額、無法佻給、十五日、特派大批日軍、前往花地屬之茶　山村泆　等處、入戶拉募、計共拉得鄕人二百餘名、十六日、又派兵赴圓溪·西塲·增步·三元里·三聖塘等處强拉、共拉得鄕民百七十餘名、於是各鄕一聞日軍到境、即羣相覓路走避、以致鷄犬不寗、農村刈穫、概行改用女工、男子不敢在田野間耕植、至廣州市面、各行小販、現亦一律改由婦女輩襁褓小孩、在馬路挑擔什物買賣、蓋不背負小孩、即女工中之被指爲有氣力者、亦得拉募故也、距料愈弄愈兇、由十八日起、更爲劇烈、十九晚、日軍突向偽廣州市警務處下令、限於兩日之內、在廣州募足壯丁八千名、送交憲兵隊部、聽候分配利用等語、僞警處奉命後、星夜嚴令全市十九個僞警署、及所轄各自警團、分派僞警、及督同自警隊、照限募足、於是空前之拉伕大慘劇、遂於十八日晨開始、十八日天曉後、偽警與自警團、分途出動、在交通衝要之馬路、及勞動界閒常聚集之地點、如各魚菜墟市等、搜索强拉、惟連日市面一再拉伕、市民已如驚弓之鳥、普通人固無事不出、即一般小販、亦寗願扺餓挨饑、暫時伏處屋中不出、以避强拉、祇有一部份已到山窮水盡、無法再捱者、始冒險出而謀一升斗、然亦提肝吊膽、刻刻防範、或繞道較爲僻靜之內街來往、不料僞警爲圖卸責、竟網羅密佈、四處兜截、故雖繞道而行、亦不能倖免、上午九時許、被拉者已纍纍然、解返各僞警署、被拉者之妻子聞報、有號哭於各僞警署門前、懇求釋放者、有相遇於途、牽衣痛哭不捨者、其慘况使鐵石人見之、亦爲下淚、僞警置之不理、强拉而去、倘與日軍相遇、則輒予以痛毆、一時全市爲愁雲所籠罩、風聲所播、凡屬男性、多不敢行於市上、路上所見、以婦女佔大多數、至十八日午後、僞警見路上已無可拉之人、而距額定八千人之數尙大、乃開始向商店强拉、日軍亦督同强拉、因此大部份商店、俱閉門停止營業、茶居亦多停業、滿目荒凉、路上行人、遂吿絕跡、日僞乃在四郊及長堤一帶、俟由各鄉入市之鄉人、及由外處返者而拉之、影響所及、魚菜販亦不敢出而買賣、多數食品絕市、路上所見、除衰弱婦孺外、幾不見男子面、至二十日、日僞拉伕、仍如十八十九兩日、惟此消息已播及附省各鄕、於是來廣州之人、亦吿絕跡、整個廣州、儼如死市、至下午四時、派出拉伕之日偽軍警、始行收隊、各僞警署門前、貼出字招、有「伕已足額停止招募」等字、居民初恐其誘出强拉、仍相戒不出、後見路上已無日僞、始略有出而購買必需之用品者、下午五時許、一小部份店舖、開門復業、經此一連三日之大拉伕後、居民鑒於虎穴難留、紛紛他遷、甫由他處返廣州者、亦再遷去、故二十一日離廣州之人、絡繹不絕、至被拉去之數千人、聞係用船載往他處、惟未詳悉其載往何處、</p>
<p>又據由廣州逃來者稱、「自粤南戰事爆發後、廣州日軍、即開始拉伕、直至最近、尙未停止、余此次僥倖逃出虎口、安然來港、誠屬萬幸、日軍此次拉伕、不論男女老弱、均在被拉之列、開始至今、男女被拉者不下四五萬人、一部驅往粤南入桂、担任運輸輜重、一部則驅赴西北兩江前綫、替其建築防禦工事、及挑運軍用品物、余於兩月前曾被拉、充當苦役一次、所拉市民、固無工値發給、日中兩餐、亦僅給日軍在陣塲上所食餘之冷飯包、無日不在飢餓中、除捱飢築完防禦工事外、如遇竄侵或華軍反攻掩襲時、日軍即用機槍由後監押、盡驅此赤手空拳之佚役上前頂陣、充當砲灰、如遇有後退者、即用機槍掃射、進退均死、月前日軍北竄、侵犯三水蘆苞及粤南等數役、日軍均用此種慘無人道之手段、日僞軍名此爲「肉堡壘」、使華軍有所顧忌、擾亂目標、俾苟延殘命、此可見日軍長戰之一斑、近西北兩江及粤南等戰役、被拉民衆之如是犧牲者、不勝其數、猶有慘不忍言者、刻下日軍在廣州市及淪陷區所强拉之夫役、旣不分男女老弱、一經被捕、如稍有抗拒或潛逃者、即以酷刑相加、在廣州市被拉之數萬人內、最低限度、有千餘人遭其屠殺」云、</p>
<h3>常熱城內　秩序尚未恢復</h3>
<p>據常熟城內來人談、確息、該縣城關於六日起已全天開放、惟日軍經此次被襲後、異常恐懼、故凡有日駐軍處、即加疊沙袋、而城內商鋪、經此次閉城五日大索後、秩序仍未能復原、門庭冷落、情形殊爲蕭條、蓋居民輕易不願入城也、至於日軍之死傷者、據其自行發表爲一死一傷、該游擊隊士於襲擊時、其最先之一人、係僞裝駝背、事後即進入讀書里、登山而遁、故日軍於大索時、曾將城內外之駝子多人、全部捕去、並在虞山麓附近、北門一帶居戶、搜索尤厲、現被捕者一部分已釋出、惟有某鄕之販襲糠者、被關閉在城內、登城尋覓船隻時、適爲日軍所瞥見、認爲與此有關、即將其綑縛、先燃其髮、然後將鐵扦燒紅、刺其口鼻、現雖解往警備隊、但因受酷刑甚重、恐有生命之虞、於此可證日軍手段之酷毒、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯平庸</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐褂牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市情况始終平凡、賣買淸稀、惟潛勢續吿微緊、蓋以沙遜及洋行界稍來扒入故也、晨開均平、開後市象岑寂、絕無精彩、徘徊至十時許、始有西商沙遜突來扒人二月份先令、不旋踵更有三四月棉麥結款、雖日行曾來塞出、但市面已略形帶緊、英金至四辦士八一二五、美滙達七元九〇六二五、嗣後扒者知足、然賣方同時絕跡、復呈呆滯之象、直至收盤、稍形回平、爲四辦士八二八一二五及七元九三七五、午後繼續沉靜、迄至收盤、一無變動、價仍均與午收相埒、結果比隔昨又微緊〇一五六二五及〇三一二五、期貨趨勢與現貨無異、</p>
<p>三四月期美滙做開</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近　漲一五、遠期長三一二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬·法等滙俱平、美對英升二五、對法大二五、對滬小五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士八四三七五、美滙七元九六八七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後市况沉靜、缺乏變化、僅外銀行略有互做現貨英金四辦士八四三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大一分一五、此後仍頗平靜、迨十時光景、西商沙遜首來扒入外行有利二月份英金四辦士七八一二五、後因外行供意轉淡、且其時洋行界稍有棉麥結款、故市面略形軟化、計沙遜又扒進外行三月份英金四辦士七五、繼而進口商亦結進大通某行等美行三月份美滙七元六二五、及四月份美滙七元半、時日洋行亦購納日行正金現貨英金四辦士八一一五、同時現貨美滙亦軟至七元九〇六二五、嗣後扒者漸少、爲狀遂形轉定、迄至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士八二八一二五、美滙七元九三七五、比晨開微緊〇一五六、五及〇三一二五、</p>
<p>午後交易愈形清淡</p>
<p>後市狀態愈形沉寂、交易奇淸、祇有外銀行曾互做過、本月份美滙七元九三七五、斯時現貨美滙七元九六八七五、難結難賣、惟迄晚收銀行現貨賣價、英金仍四辦士八二八一二五、美滙亦仍爲七元九三七五、本月份英金四辦士八一二五、美滙七元九〇六二五、下月份英金四辦士七五、美滙七元七八一二五、結果比隔昨現期英均微緊〇一五六二五、美俱略軟〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>貼現進卅元關</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、下低益銳、每千元之貼率已破入三十元關內、晨初做三十一元半、不久即步退至午刻爲二十九元、下午稍見回上、終爲二十九元五角、比前日再軋小二元五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍掛一角五分云、</p>
<h3>外幣稍堅</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、交易未盛、市况寗靜、趨勢微堅、英美金鎊需要稍殷、市價微升、美金票供給稀少、市價稍挺、全日寗靜無變化、晚市爲十一元六角、荷蘭票略有需要、市價稍秀、日金票供給蛟盛、市况稍軟、晚市爲一元二角六分五厘、朝鮮票仍爲一元零五分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升五角、美金票升四分、荷蘭票升一角、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>金市風平浪靜</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、仍無重大演變、原因日來外滙呆滯、及各帮多抱觀望、一切無足左右市面、絕難發生劇烈反嚮、論昨日過程、始終徘徊、晨開頗平爲四千零八十元、繼因金號售出再挫至四千零七十七元低價、嗣以匯市略軟、某錢兌業與證券帮先後撈入、會被拉高至四千零九十元頂盤、旋乃滙市轉定、金號復來塞出、同時證券帮亦轉買爲賣、故午收祇有四千零八十五元、午後情况更靜、僅有四元上落、結果仍以四千零八十五元收盤、較上日又漲四元、至全天交易寥落、約五百兩光景、銀樓飾金呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤祇好四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢平靜、首由錢兌業出證券帮十兩、爲四千零八十元、較之前收計小一元、少頃金號稍來塞出、又撳三元、賣予證券帮二十兩爲四千零七十七元、迨十時一刻光景、滙市略形帶軟、且某錢兌業頻來撈入、逐漸回高、某錢兌業進同業十兩、爲四千零八十六元、後銀樓帮售予證券帮二十剛、爲四千零八十四元、此後證券帮繼續吸進、遂再抬起六元、證券帮進金號二十兩、爲四千零九十元、其時外滙止緊趨平、金號復來吐出、且證券帮亦反進爲出、故乃下挫、證券帮賣予錢兌業三十兩、爲四千零八十七元、將近收盤時、金號吐予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千零八十五元、作午收價、午後狀况愈靜、首先抬起二元、錢兌業進余號十兩、爲四千零八十七元、少頃某銀號稍來吐出、撳低四元、買予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千零八十三元、入後二時半光景、錢兌業進證券帮十兩、爲四千零八十五元作晚收價、結果比上日又漲四元、全天十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標余照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、始終呆定、大同行仍懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减少十五元光景、</p>
<h3>紗花　浮多專賣　紗價不支　雙馬再跌十五元</h3>
<p>紗市價疲、目跌風愈熾、實緣現紗銷路狹窄、以致存貨日見滿溢、雖多頭拉緊不放、然買來賣去、仍小能脫離市塲、今則美印棉市反動下降、多頸人心更虛、市態乃愈形不支、就此而論、二十支雙馬七百元關門恐難保存也、加之年關伊邇、一般手貨勢必斬結也、</p>
<p>現綃晨開以歐美棉市不振、跌風復起、塲中賣者反夥、二十支雙馬開價爲七百十一元、微跌至七百十元、後經多頭仍來維持、稍有收進、回升至七百十四元半、因實際地位始終不能進展、盤旋甚久、迨至收盤時、聞外匯平靜、浮多吐出、二十支雙馬跌風又起、跌至七百零八元收盤、查半日間成交統計一千四百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十五元、天女跌十五元、雙地球跌十四元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、同行一、三〇〇　香港一四〇寗波　一〇　內地　一五統計一、四六五</p>
<h3>本棉隨外市回挫　交易亦淸淡異常</h3>
<p>本棉交易愈形沉寂、同行買賣亦見减少、此緣堅挺之美印棉市、跌風忽起、致人心隨之回挫、同時廠方需要淡泊、加之棉紗實需停頓、售價日趨墮落、蘇北來源、計通花三百包常陰沙二百三十六包、北沙六百二十包、茲將現棉售開之盤列左、太倉花　一六七·〇〇　廣勤進二八五包平果爾　一六五·〇〇　同行進一五〇件通草包　一六四·〇〇　同行進二〇〇包火草包　一五八·〇〇　同行進二〇〇包火打包　一六九·〇〇　元一進一五〇件草　包　一六〇·〇〇　同行進二五〇包</p>
<p>另訊、外棉紐約棉市、日來較形疲乏、晨初開盤因投機者之拋賣、市况即形下墜、後又因股票價格之慘落、及海外商之賣出而冉跌、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落十餘磅音、印度連同預測跌十餘雜比、埃及跌三十餘　音、利物浦跌十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日見沉悶、各方俱無意購辦、竟成死市、同業雖稍有進胃、惟以滙兌風險甚巨、不敢冒然從事、加以廠方毫無進胃、故均畏縮小前矣、日方廠商亦殊爲靜寂、惟一般預料、日來外棉交易或有轉機也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙七元八匕五折合送廠價如下、二十支美米特林　二二八·二〇二十支美米特林下級二二三·九五三二支美米特林　二四〇·五〇三二支美米特林下級二三四·七〇四二支美米特林　二四五·二〇四二支美米特林下級二三六·九五</p>
<h3>糧食　米市不穩　由於來貨常阻</h3>
<p>米市目轉徘徊局面後、昨初開尙屬平穩、緣客販仍鮮拋出、作客亦少採辦、至內地來源、雖日有運到、然爲數不若前週之巨、僅四五百包、而須虹口轉出、近朝更一度有所留難、允覺寥寥、昨則聞已解決、可由浦江駁運、因之上市者見多、計南港早晚稻及薄稻等不下一二千包、獨其中多屬大市及中段之貨、特別者則殊無幾、因之一般店舖、對於高貨應需急急、較次貨納胃不過如是、且吃盤尙難驟鬆、故國米無論爲薄粳及變元價自早至午、一路平庸、無甚上落、迄洋米帶緊之後，始亦略提二三角、至於各色洋米、近來市上本屬大宗去路、故晨市雖一度平復、及後一聞外滙又縮、銷塲頓轉活潑、而原包貨依然守持不出、僅一般回籠貨相互授受、無如供不敷求、乃購進者略事放價搜求、遂見向上、</p>
<p>洋米晨間尙居平局、旋因卸棧於虹口者又未能照常搬運、且國外定價頻頻報漲、市上人心又多向上、新交易旣未妥交、回籠原包亦未接近、現洋米由疲轉俏、後市反見較昂二三角、惟本街需胃甚淡、鄕作客行亦乏暢胃、而前定各貨仍在相繼抵埠中、昨由阿克司輪新到五千多包外、尙有一二船亦可於日內到滬云、</p>
<h3>麵粉漲無止境　本街批價再升二角小麥又創空前高價</h3>
<p>麵粉　自砲車客盤漲達十元大關後、各廠於昨日起又將本街批價再度加增二角、改爲九元六角、而對於客盤表面雖未再加、實際上又限制供給、故客銷經前日一度活動後、昨又驟轉淸淡、粉市環境、益趨良好、在米價平軟聲中、初不料粉價漲度之更爲迅速也、十元粉價旣已看到、不知將於何底、此皆國外洋麥一時訂購困難、及國麥售價一再昂貴所致、聞日廠鳳凰牌現粉亦漲二角、期貨則以買賣糾粉未了、繼續停頓云、今日出口麵粉有六千五白包運往天津、</p>
<h3>建築材料　水木料無一不漲</h3>
<p>原因來源减少燃料漲價磚瓦石灰忽爲攔截建築材料、自新年以來、大抵均較去年爲漲、洋松爲歐洲多事、船隻减少、運費增加、祥泰等各大公司、惟恐以後歐洲貨運發生問題、滬地存貨不願廉售、並且提高價格、各行號爲欲求資金之流動、依然互相競賣、故市價尙未至最高峯、本松杉木、前者爲來源斷絕、滬市存底有限、故漲而再漲、其價格幾與洋松相埒、茲雖間或偶有到貨、但爲數甚微、運費頗鉅、杯水車薪、寗濟於事、且成本加大、故造成有漲無跌之局面、五金物品屬於洋貨者爲多、邇來滬地建築雖多、但均屬於普通居室、巨厦高屋頗少、重料大材之購買力、不無薄弱、更兼外滙好轉、照理市價應趨下降、今則反是、非惟不跌、抑且上漲、其原因、亦由於歐洲風雲惡劣、人心看好、內外行均囤積居奇、以待善價、磚瓦石灰、原爲燃料漲價而漲價、茲發生非常價格者、爲受某方大批壟斷所致、截留於滬郊、大小水料船雙不下二三百艘、用意何在、莫明所以、今市塲中雖創此新高價、而應市之貨仍微乎其微、水泥初則爲煤炭漲價提高成木、繼則爲來源减少、求過於供、而販賣者更乘機搮縱、致其價格一漲再漲、打破歷來之記錄、（樂）</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥市况更見昂貴、最高價竟達十七元高峰、實爲從來所未有、種種環境、造成此種狀態、聞華廠收進盤子、已寬放至十六元六角、而售手依然不肯多售、結果僅開一二千包、市塲囤戶收進者、約計三四車、售價已到十七元之高峰云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆至稀價昂</h3>
<p>黃豆因來源無充分供給、祇靠蕪湖路少數蟬聯、無濟於事、且高貨奇缺、故以中關貨在近兩日來、邁步提升、高品豆反呈呆大、出於價位太高、難免碍手、昨市雖有二十元之丁家州豆做開、但數祇幾十包、（由本街菜担承銷）業中不作正市論、然照刻下各方濃厚之利多空氣、觀察二十元買担中關豆、祇在轉瞬之間耳、昨統市計開丁家州豆一千餘包、（價詳市價欄）蕪湖豆二車、南京豆五車、及靑島豆三百包、昨由北沙裝來豆子一百八十包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　溫炭回小　海門炭仍擯持</h3>
<p>溫州木炭、自此次新貨大批到埠以後、人心旣定、市盤亦漸見回鬆、五十磅甲種炭、同業行拆、每担十一元五角、門莊發客、每簍六元五角，惟海門平帽炭、來源不多、價仍擯持、碼頭貨每担尙在八元左右行情、東疋囤戶頗有斬結</p>
<h3>疋頭　布廠趕織定貨</h3>
<p>布市稍挫、乃緣紗價日降、染廠緩進　坯布囤戶放出、惟國內外實銷仍旺、廠方均趕織定貨、餘額僅占小數、故跌勢迂緩、細布細斜·粗布跌二角半、漂染布跌五角之譜、獨英商怡和綸昌二廠出品售盤較爲堅穩、浙贛帮辦豐布細布粗布一百餘件、閩　辦已斜嗶嘰一百二十餘件、烟津帮辦藍布等貨百餘箱、國外暹羅等地辦漂布·色布·色斜·花布·府綢等一萬一千餘疋、十二日運香港一千六百件、運烟台四百三十件、</p>
<p>東布　晨跌午回、市情恍惚、蓋上午以實需清淡、洋行期貨細布開價突降、致一部份小額囤戶漸露恐慌忍痛斬結、十二磅龍頭細布低盤跌至二十元三角、四君子元嗶嘰售過六角五分七厘半、後市天津帮起而動辦細布、進胃甚健、採辦現期貨各牌一千餘件、市勢又緊、龍頭最高價回至二十一元七角半、收盤二十一元六角、龍頭細斜二十一元二角半、則與衣日比例、每疋升降僅五分角之間、惟洋行遠期細布開出數額、聞亦達千件左右、價格廉宜、不無影響、如下月份龍顛細布做出價爲二十二元陽鶴二十一元九角、本月份飛魚二十一元八角、</p>
<h3>糖市　片青開四十三元</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚上落、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、本棧貨五十六元半、外棧新到五十七元一角、老貨五十六元四角、轉口貨四十五元半、太古車白　嘜東棧五十八元、西棧五十八元半、其餘均叫原價、荷赤ＭＰ嘜四十五元、油包四十四元、本綿白及本冰均無　動、國精市勢較緊、但成交無多、蓋行方以價位已高不欲購存也、昨廣帮僅開出石門片靑八十五袋、價爲四十三元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　中外絲價同疲</h3>
<p>日美絲市續向下回、紐約近期跌七分半、遠期跌一角三分五、橫濱現貨晨市跌四十元、下午收盤跌六十元、遠期跌六十五元、下午停市、本埠絲市、人心較疲、白廠七十八分均度昨開九千八百元、與月前高價計錄小五百元、達昌等進二十担、千金又成交四十担、價同前市、</p>

<h3>王店炸車案發生後　日軍慘虐無辜滬杭乘客備受嚴厲檢查政工隊員慘遭非刑處置　沈蕩半鎭已變灰燼</h3>
<p>滬杭路來客談、自在王店附近日軍運貨車被地雷炸燬後、迄今尙有被炸之車六輛、遺在路軌之旁、日軍乃遷怒於乘客、日來凡滬杭車上下之旅客、備受檢查、嚴厲非常、乘客在車中、見日軍檢查員將至、須立即將衣服解聞、及衣服包裹等一切携帶物品、無不開箱解紐、待其檢查、男女均同樣對待、動作稍遲、立遭毆擊、昨日二班車有女乘客不知就裏、將包裏解開稍遲、檢查員立提龐大之包裹、向其頂上</p>
<p>猛擲數下</p>
<p>所有乘客、均敢怒而不敢言、硤石接近袁花之處、有馮家橋、駐有專員公署所派之政工隊男女隊員十餘人、不知如何爲日軍偵悉、突往包圍、男女隊員悉爲日軍所捕、橫施鞭撻無論已、志行純潔之女隊員、强加侮辱、備遭蹂躪之後、與男隊員同以</p>
<p>手掌穿孔</p>
<p>貫繩而過、聯接而行、一人手動，繩索牽動、連貫之手掌、無一不磨擦劇痛、慘呼之聲、聞者酸鼻、迤邐解往嘉興處刑、凡日軍認爲有間諜或便衣隊嫌疑者、則以桶提水、不斷向其口鼻間灌入、腹脹如五石瓢、糞便自口中倒流而出、</p>
<p>窒息聲嘶</p>
<p>非至其屈認不止、又聞駐在袁花之日軍、有部分駐紥於呂宅內、呂素富厚、埋藏之銀圓甚富、統爲日軍掘去、聞就地銀圓兌價、每則可兌法幣兩元三角、日軍前日又至沈蕩、將該鎭縱火燒去千數百幢、沈蕩向稱巨鎭、今亦半鎭燬於刦火矣、</p>
<h3>滬西警權　賡續談判　仍無接近可能</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路問題、工部局屢與「市府」接觸談判、但迄無具　結果、工部局方面、對於刻仍努力繼續進行、雖本月六日工部局總辦兼總裁之費利溥氏突遭狙擊、幸得脫險、然費氏並不以爲意、仍全神貫注於越界築路之警權交涉、十一日下午四時許、費氏曾與工部局總董樊克令氏同訪博筱庵於虹口施高塔路傳寓、聞所談者、仍爲上項問題、惟聞雙方仍無接近之可能性、</p>
<h3>日輪崇明丸　遇炸沉沒　損失頗重大廿二人失踪</h3>
<p>自日軍佔領長江沿岸一帶地區後、對於長江航綫藉口軍事關係迄未開放、僅日輪得往返行駛、英美德意各國外輪、均被阻撓、最近雖日方宣布開放長江下游、但迄今仍木實現、茲據大光社記者向航業界探悉、日方「東亞海運公司」之崇明丸、係行駛於蕪湖與漢口之間、專裝客貨、因無外輪競航、故營業極爲發達、該輪於十日晨由蕪駛漢、迨十一時、在離漢口三十里左右之江面、突然觸及爆炸物、轟然一聲、船底即被炸裂、船身隨之下沉、事後由日汽船桃丸馳往援救、但日船員及乘客廿二名已失踪、衆信必已溺斃無疑、聞該輪裝有米糧及軍用品頗多、損失極爲重大、</p>
<h3>統一公債八次本息　滬市付匯劃票　四行決予貼現付款上海仍分六期付清</h3>
<p>國民政府爲統一債券名稱、換償舊有各種債券、由財政部發行民國二十五年統一公債、甲乙丙丁戊五種債票、總共國幣十四萬六千萬元、以關餘爲償付本息之基金、自淪陷區域海關稅收被截留、財政部於去年一月十五日、通吿此後償付本息辦法、惟中中交農四行爲維持內債信用起見、允對到期本息貼現付款、第七次還本付息之款、已由四行貼現於上年七月三十一日起付款、惟上海則分六期付淸、業已於去年底</p>
<p>如數付清</p>
<p>關於第八次還本抽籤、巳由國債基金管理委員會執行、凡抽中各債票、暨到期息金、總共五千六百四十七萬六千六百元、依照條例規定、付款日期爲一月三十一日、據新聲社記者昨向四行上海分行及國債基金管理委員會探悉、關於統一公債第八次還本付息、雖未奉四行總行貼現付款命令、但決</p>
<p>仿照上次</p>
<p>貼現辦法付款、上海仍分六期付淸、付給上海市塲通用之滙劃票據、</p>

<h3>增發紙幣謠諑　事實證明無稽　投機者謠言無日無之故滙市始終未受影響</h3>
<p>中國對外貿易好轉變爲出超後、外匯基金愈趨鞏固、法定匯價始終不墜、正當需要儘量供給、上海黑市外匯、漸趨穩定、此在投機者索然無味、但爲商人所歡迎、因正當商業之發展、應以平穩之匯市爲基礎也、惟投機者利用上海之特殊環境、放謠牟利、於是市上謠諑如春雲之時展時放、實無一日無之、如某方傳中國政府將增發紙幣八萬萬元、旋又傳倫敦印有大宗中國紙幣、今經事實證明完全無稽、中國政府對於穩定幣制抱有極大決心、故匯市終未受此類流言影響、似此穩定之局面、若能持久、則一般社會將認目前之匯價爲新水準、物價將以此爲變動之依據、一切企業計劃、亦將以是爲出發點、</p>
<h3>挪威輪自津來滬　突遭海關搜查　疑該輪私藏鴉片或毒物澈底搜檢須至今日畢事</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、、挪威輪船蘭地號、載重一千八百噸、昨日（十一日）午後、自天津載羊皮與紙張駛抵上海、泊法租界外灘羅斯福碼頭、經海關人員檢查一過、但至夜半、忽有「市警局」</p>
<p>汽艇兩艘</p>
<p>駛至船旁、派出十五人登船、、關員一名見狀、立即召到海關水上巡捕飭令「市警」退去、海關人員、疑若輩並非「市警」、乃派稽查十五名、於今晨登船</p>
<p>澈底搜查　但至今午、仍無所獲、船長克列斯登遜今晨不在船上惟據該船某高級船員聲稱、事前絕無所知、至晨間八時醒來、始見稽查員方施搜查、</p>
<p>頗為驚詫</p>
<p>渠信船上未載遠禁物云、但海關人員頗疑該船密藏大量鴉片或其他毒物、據海關某員聲稱、今雖希望本日搜查完畢、但恐至少須至明日（十三日）始能竣事、</p>

<p>桃源洋行</p>
<p>Ｇ．Ｆ．Ｈ．　號鐵駁一艘、自口岸裝儎燒酒四百餘甏、猪玀數百隻、柴爿若干捆、並有船員二十餘人、各在江北帶購白米二十餘包、昨晨抵吳淞口、等候檢查完畢後、於下午到滬、停靠大馬路外灘十三號碼頭，當有日水上憲兵一名偕譒譯一人、乘小輪至該鐵駁檢查查出有白米、即加詢究、船員支吾以對、日兵</p>

<p>縮短夜市　至於歐戰近情、各國備戰最近更趨積極、法政府對於外僑管制綦嚴、白晝在街上行走、務須依照法政府戰時條例、備帶防毒面具、吾則即禁止行走、夜間無特別通行證之外僑、一概不准通行、吾則即予拘禁、故華僑商店之夜間營業時間、已自動逐漸縮短、</p>

<p>蘇州河北交涉歸還</p>
<p>關於蘇州河以北區域歸還本局完全管理之交涉、並未獲有結果、但本局得日本當道合作以後、所有簽發該區各項執服之權、已較爲擴大、華人之欲前往虹口及楊樹浦兩區者、必須執有通行證、此項通行證、仍由駐守之日本哨兵查騐、但貨物搬運所遭限制、巳較爲鬆弛、</p>
<p>界內難民三萬餘人</p>
<p>本局所屬各處在蘇州河以南各區、除執行通常事務外復須辦理若干繁重工作、在年底時、界內有華籍難民收容所二十八家、共容難民約三三·〇〇〇人、由本局管理照料、本局設法將各該收容所繼續合併、俾在管理方面、更能嚴密、滬西界外區域、在者原爲住宅區、近年該處紛紛建造工廠房屋、但上年建</p>

<p>限制米價取締囤積</p>
<p>本局對於租界內食糧及燃料之供給、曾加以密切注意、允以米煤兩項爲圾、上年夏季、米價在漲、兩租界當道曾會銜頒發布吿、限制米價、迨八月間、白米售價、曾一度高漲至每石五十元、超出限價多多、若十米店、因無法進貨、停止營業、而以劣米攙售者、亦屬數見不鮮、嗣因產米區域、收成良好、米價逐步低落、但於十二月間、重又高抬、於是兩租界當道再度會銜布吿、對於一般囤積投機分子、予以嚴重警吿、</p>
<p>電力煤氣分別加價</p>
<p>關於煤斤一項、遠東方面、存貨缺乏、不得不改向國外訂購、因此煤價大漲、本局燃料委員會會隨時注意及此、煤價旣漲、最感困難者、厥爲上海電力公司、與上海煤氣公司、於是先後呈准本局、分別加徵附加費、藉以彌補巨額營業用費、</p>
<p>猶太籍難民之處置</p>
<p>前年年底將近、大批猶太籍難民開始山中歐來滬、迨上年閒人數激增、情形始吿嚴重、難民大部份安插於蘇州河北區收容所內、此項安插工作、由若干委員會及團體負責辦理、本局亦曾予以恊助、出借若干東區局有房屋、以供收容之用、嗣因難民陸續到達、情形愈趨嚴重、本局乃商請領事團以本埠困靴情况及難民無法覓取職業各點、分別電吿各該政府、轉請設法阻止若輩來滬、未見成效、洎乎四月間、難民總數超過六千人、五」間、收容所內有腥紅熱之發現、幸經措置得宜、未見流行、六月間難民總數達一萬人左右、八月間、增至一萬五千人左右、於是日本當道宣布暫禁難民來滬、同時本局亦决定禁止歐洲難民繼續入境、並分函領事團及各輪船公司查照、十月間、本局與日本當道商定頒布一種規則、酌允此輩難民、於來滬後住居於蘇州河以南區域、截至年底時、根據此項規則所頒發之許可證、共約三百份、</p>
<p>馬路積水力求防免</p>
<p>上年蘇州河以南不少部份、時遭積水泛溢、諸感不便、本局曾於十一月間發表文吿、解釋積水原因、查馬路積水、不外因江潮高漲及雨量過度、關於防止江潮高漲一端、本局務處曾於積水區域內各陰溝口、裝置活瓣、以免江水倒灌、外灘沿邊、加築堤墻一道、並裝設帮浦一具、俾於陰溝口堵塞之時、得以疏洩溝水、此等措施、已見成效、上年雨量過度、積水區域擴大、且歷時較久、共理由爲（一）一九三七年八月以後、浦江與蘇州河、久未疏浚、（二）本市地面逐年低落、（三）西區界外馬路區域工業、突然發達、未受本局控制、（四）法租界之陰溝出口、在福煦路與公共租界之銜接處、不易維持完善、本局工務處長曾向董事會報吿、積水情形、如欲澈底改善、佔計約需國幣八十萬元、當時本局以財力不及、未經舉辦、但議決應於一九四〇年內盡量採取各種合乎情理之措置、本年倘非雨水過多、則上述情形、當可大見改善也、（未完）</p>

<h3>思想的旅行</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>跟一位青年朋友談起遊山玩水的樂趣與旅行的重要，這位朋友告訴了我一件可驚的事實。他說有許多生長在上海的朋友，二十幾年來從來沒有乘過輪船，從來沒有搭過火車，從來沒有離開上海一步。</p>
<p>好像有點荒謬不經，可是我相信他的話，我曉得這是事實，因為在一般中國人的家庭裏，無事而出門簡直是例外而又例外的事。</p>
<p>生活在交通這樣便利的文明社會，有著一個龐大的世界可以任我們觀賞，增加我們活的智識，可是我們卻甯願做一隻坐井觀天的小青蛙，生活在狹小的角落。</p>
<p>我嘆息著。</p>
<p>我不但嘆息著中國人生活範圍的狹窄，我不但嘆息著中國人不了解旅行意義的重大，我更嘆息著中國人不會利用思想旅行的機會。</p>
<p>話甚麼話？甚麼呌做思想的旅行呢？</p>
<p>書店裏有的是書，報攤上有的是報紙雜誌。書報雜誌就是我們思想旅行的工具，就是精神上的火車輪船與飛機。書中有的不是黃金屋，書中有的不是颜如玉，書中有的是思想，是科學，是人生，是社會，是做人的道理，是生活的智識，是廣大無邊的世界。</p>
<p>讀一本書，等於作一次思想上的長途旅行，閱一張報，看一本雜誌，可以呌你在幾分鍾中，到老遠老遠的天邊海角去兜一個大圈子。</p>
<p>我們不但了解旅行的意義，我們更要了解思想旅行的重要。</p>
<p>人世的旅客啊，讓我們放款去，讓我們天天花些時間去作思想上的旅行去！</p>

<h3>做的的責任</h3>
<p>— 歐陽文</p>
<p>我們生長到世界上來，是為著一些愛，為著一些虛幻的飄渺的愛，我們愛鳥，愛花，愛山，愛水，愛大地，愛一切的東西；其實我們也正為他們所愛。</p>
<p>十多年來我們是在愛裏找尋幸福，也是在愛裏忍受痛苦，這些幸福使我們忘記一切悽愁的過度，這些痛苦使我們鼓勵著自己向前邁進，任何的困難是阻擋不住我們的雄心，任社會的壓力如何，環境的脅迫怎樣，我們只知向前走，向前走，直走上光明的燈塔。</p>
<p>這期間，我們認識了許多朋友，看清了許多面目，這個是吃人的，那個是騙人的，這個是虛偽的，那個是引誘的，然而我們沒有被吃，沒有被騙，同樣地虛偽只能哄他自己，引誘只能迷他自己，我們是不會上當的。</p>
<p>今天我們回想到十多年來前的快樂和中間的奮鬥，禁不住留下眼淚來了，我們小時所看見的屋子，現在已古老了，我們小時所熟悉的道路，現在已變樣了，我們小時所認識的朋友同學，現在都做了爸爸媽媽了，時代的巨輪是推進得這樣的快呵！</p>
<p>我們有著很多的朋友，這是我們生活存在這世界上最大的意義，也是最大的安慰，有的朋友幫助我們生活，有的朋友指示我們前途，更有著的朋友願犧牲了自己為我們排解困難，使我們得到幸福；我們不知要如何地感謝他們，我們知道這就是人類的愛，就是天地間的至神至聖的愛，我們也只有拿這愛來報答他們。</p>
<p>我們記著責任，記著做人的責任。做人的責任是甚麼呢？是把自己的愛獻托出來，是把自己的力量表達出來，是把自己的一切都給予社會，我們在社會上做有益的工作，我們不要計較一些代價，社稷一些酬報，要知給代價和酬報約束住的工作，不是真的工作，是一種騙人的幌子，我們不是騙子，我們還是二個年幼的懷著純潔思想的孩童。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>甘地與尼赫魯</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>甘地和尼赫魯是印度的兩個革命領袖，甘地早已全球聞名，尼赫魯去年才來訪問我國，大家對他也很熟識了。他們這兩位的人生觀不同，脾氣也各別，然而他們之間，卻有著強固的精神上的聯繫。兩個領袖能如此合作，倒是世所罕見的呢。</p>
<p>關於他們兩人的個性的對照，說起來很有趣；甘地是個虞城的宗教家，尼赫魯可就不信鬼神，他主張政教應該分離。甘地所理想的印度是個生活簡樸的農村社會。尼赫魯則受過新思潮洗禮，他要把印度改造成工業化的都市社會。甘地頂相信不流血的抵抗法，尼赫魯以為這不過是權宜之計而已。甘地反對社會上經濟上有什麼激劇的改革，他以為頂要緊的是人人自己洗心革面，求得靈魂上的清淨，社會是可以由各階級的合作來改良的；可是尼赫魯懷疑這一些，他說如果物質環境沒有改變，單要改造良心，談何容易？這樣看來，甘地的理想，似乎比較的空洞些，尼赫魯對於自己心中的計劃，便頭緒清楚得多了。</p>
<p>然而甘地絕不是反動派，他是富代最特別的革命家，他的方法太奇怪了，別說西洋人不懂得他，就是他的老同志，也還有人認為他是一個「謎」。他有一種奇錄的精神力量，三萬萬印度人的靈魂，好像無時無刻不受著他的影響。此外，他的勇氣，他的刻苦的生活，他的不屈不撓的精神，都是世界上所少有的。所以尼赫魯儘管在思想上和甘地不同，在事實上，尼赫魯對於甘地簡直崇拜得五體投地。</p>
<p>尼赫魯從來不直稱他做「甘地」他總呌他做「爺爺」（Bapu）或是「甘地爺」（Gandhiji）。他有什麼疑難，總是去請教甘地。極力推崇甘地的意見，把自己的主張反而看得低一些。有時印度的前進青年批評甘地太落伍了，甘地自己也不去加以置辦，可是尼赫魯便要大聲疾呼地去糾正他們的廖見。印度詩人太戈爾會說過：「除了甘地之外，沒有人再感覺到印度人就是他自己身上的血肉了。」這一句話，尼赫魯十分贊成。</p>
<p>甘地和尼赫魯都出身富貴，後來卻都情願放棄了安樂的生活，獻身給被壓迫的民眾，他們都犧牲了一切，去從事印度民族的解放運動。他們兩人的目標相同，使命相同，外加再有師徒的關係，怎麼會不合作呢？甘地說得最好：「我同尼赫魯都覺得我們倆誰都缺不了誰，在我們之間，就有著一條心靈上的聯繫，這是任何理智上的差別所不能毀壞的。」</p>
<p>我們有著信仰，這信仰使我們立足在世界上永遠不會跌倒，我們好比一條船在兇蠻的浪濤裏行進，一個大浪擊著我們，不怕，二個大浪擊著我們，也不怕，三個大浪擊著我們，更不怕！為甚麼呢？因為我們有著目標，有著信仰，我們的精神是勇敢的，我們的意志是堅定的，失敗了要努力，成功了更要努力，我們很清楚地知道這不是做牛馬，是在替大眾謀幸福，我們快要到達岸頭了，我們的朋友攜起手來吧。</p>

<h3>裝聾作啞</h3>
<p>— 洪飛</p>
<p>二次歐戰爆發以後，有一天，英王喬治在參觀兵工廠的時候，停下來看擦砲彈內部的工人在工作著。在擦砲彈的時候，磨擦的聲浪非常之大，真是可謂震耳欲聾，所以普通的工人是不能擔任這種工作的，廠方所請的是聾啞的工人。英王就由一個小玻璃窗口，探首去看那些「機器人似的人物」在工作著。</p>
<p>據紐約晤士報說：現在戰爭的事業中無論是天才是殘廢者，都可以各盡其能。利用聾啞的工人去磨擦砲彈，猶如利用籠中的金絲雀去試探有沒有毒氣吹來一樣。不過在民主國中，我們是有說這句話的權利的：祇有在戰爭的緊急時期中，我們才把聾啞的人徵聘來但任機器人的職務。可是在現代的新極權主義的文化中，人類的一生完全陷入於機器人的狀態中了。不論是在和平的時候，或是在戰爭的期間，那些被壓迫的民眾，事實上簡直等於是聾啞子。他們祇能聽見他們的主子所要他們聽的話，他們祇許說他們的主子叫他們說的話。</p>
<p>極權國的民眾得裝聾作啞地盲目渡過他們的一生，這恐怕就是極權國與民主國的分別了。</p>
<h3>談片</h3>

<p>美國總統羅斯福稱孤立派為駝鳥，大有想把他們鑽在狹義的愛國主義的沙中的頭硬拉出來之概。</p>
<p>英國最流行的幽默刊物笨拙雜誌，話說俏皮而有意義。曾經有過一個作家問道：「歐洲各國為甚麼不能像個大家庭似地住在一起呢？」笨拙的答案是：歐洲壞就壞在正像多數的大家庭一樣。</p>
<p>上海有芬蘭人作援芬募捐，捐了以後稱上海人為「真正的國聯」。不知是讚是罵。</p>

<h3>弗朗哥的電影政策</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>西班牙的獨裁者弗朗哥，最近欲在國內排除外國影片的勢力，採取一種巧妙的手段。</p>
<p>他不學別的國家，用禁止影片入口的方法，却是規定凡外國影片公司，要在西班牙映片的，每十部片子中，必須有一部在西國開拍。驟然觀之，好像沒有什麼新奇，然而美國影片商因此大起恐慌，要求政府出面交涉。</p>
<p>原來弗朗哥這個電影政策，包括「推廣文化」和「套取外匯」兩個妙諦。外國片子旣在西國境內拍攝，一切背景意識當然要以親西爲宗旨，這些片子運到中美洲的時候，那裏居住的許多西班牙語民族無疑的會來看弗朗哥統治下的西班牙，替他作了義務宣傳。這是主要的一點。</p>
<p>還有，每一部片拍成，在西國開映時，所得贏餘，西國政府與外國影片商平均分拆；個如運到西國境外時，先要同西國當局，交出一筆押樅金，始准放行。同時在外國開映所得的錢，需折合外匯，與西政府對拆。</p>
<p>如此一做，有益的只有西政府，外國影片商的許多支出，要經過一個很長時期，才可撈回木錢，有時他們虧蝕甚鉅，無異在西國每映十部片，其中片的全部收入，要作爲弗朗哥的獻金。當然外國影片商儘有自由退出西班牙市塲，不過這樣一來，弗朗哥排斥外國影片的目的，就完全達到了。</p>
<h3>新艷秋別來無恙　俞振飛風姿猶昔</h3>
<p>— 碧玉</p>
<p>新艷秋原名王玉華，爲繼章遏雲後，聞名劇壇之一大坤伶，其藝悉宗程禦霜，頗具心得，爲坤伶隊中學程最肖之一人，即扮相與做表，亦能神似禦霜。新之學程，要亦下過相當苦工也。數年前，曾先後隨楊小樓馬連良南來，頗獲江南人仕之激賞。三年前，某聞人六秩稱觴，新遠道南來祝嘏並演「五花洞」「探母」等劇，其藝較前數次南來，確已進步不少。同年出演白下，適程禦霜亦演於都中，新竟輿程大打對台，肉此共名益彰。北返後，聲譽日增，在平有執坤伶牛耳之勢。去歲新因某種事件，在平一度入獄，滬上更盛傳新伶庾死獄中，旋經證實此說不確，而新則已出售共故都住宅，舉家遷津，以謀在津久居，即擬不再粉墨登塲矣。故新雖在北國，蓋已久不出演，此次史新邀角人杜菊初君，與新情商再三，新以情不可却，毅然南來，記者曾一度晤新於旅次，其人舉止談吐，一如往常，幸喜艷秋別來無恙，而滬人値此兵荒馬亂之年，得重聆新之一曲，眞可謂耳福不淺。</p>
<p>與新同來之小生，爲程禦霜之舊侶兪撮飛君，振飛生在江南，原爲南方名票，經禦霜之一再促駕而下海。振飛曾投老伶工程繼仙之門牆，與葉盛蘭同爲程之得意弟子。自與禦霜拆夥後，亦久未出演，此次隨新艷秋同來，以新之戲路宗程，由振飛配演，駕輕就熟，可謂恰到好處，預料必收牡丹綠葉之效也。振飛年來在平家居，對崑曲之探討，仍硏究不遺餘力，崑曲名家紅豆館主在平，對之尤贊賞不已。崑曲之在海上，今已成曲高和寡之局面，但精於此道者，猶不乏人，者番振飛南來，要亦顧曲人仕之佳音也。</p>
<p>劇壇零訊　小型劇團聯合組織之「中華戲劇硏究會」，近發行「戲叢書」，第一集「文天祥」，係名導演孔麟欻創作，頃已出版，內容描繪民族英雄「文天祥」，忠義磅礴，允甚「明末遺恨」。該劇聞已由「復旦劇團」最先演出，頗得好評。其第二集「小五義」則爲該會戲組同人集體創作，不久亦將問世。</p>

<p>慧芳與堃生自齟齬脫離共劇團後，一度曾與香勻合作，自挑一班，數次出演平津，並希望上海方面能有人來接，即可出黑票（黑票即並希望上海方面能有人來接，即可由黑票（黑票即係名票友，暗中支取包銀之謂）而正式下海爲伶矣。</p>
<p>無如彼究因未肯深下苦功之故，能實授之戲劇太少，故枉費江老一片掖助厚意，結果毫無成就，且始終亦未得南來一現色相，今則李之黃金時代，業經過去，而其靠山之墓木已拱，縱欲努力求進，惜已時過境遷，經濟無人援助，在北平組班且大感不易，遑論乎出演外埠矣。四大名旦之後，男且中繼起無人，香勻本有極好之戲料，又得有力之奧援，惜乎不自振拔，以爲有江老在，經濟可以無憂，彼十年前即露其頭角，豈知反不若成名較遲之張君秋尙能轟動南北，大得社會之好評。可見克享盛名之伶工，十九皆由困苦貧寒中得來，當其似成名與未成名之際，一有靠山，即阻礙其學業之發展，初享盛名之後進伶工，可不引爲殷鑑歟，臧嵐光與香勻之處境，亦髣髴相似，渠從蕙芳習藝，爲時旣暫，且其私下亦不用工習練，年輕貌美，交際繁忙，個性復極喜修飾，在平雖曾於三五月中偶爾出演一次，然皆係臨時組班，僅貼其拿手之數劇而已。（一七二）</p>

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government has already presented France with what is virtually an ultimatum, demanding that arms shipments on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway cease within two weeks, by January 23. The ultimatum contains a warning that if the French do not stop arms shipments to Chongqing on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Japanese aircraft will bomb every bridge on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Kunming to the Vietnamese border in the north. The ultimatum was submitted to the French ambassador by the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities this week during discussions with the French ambassador to Japan regarding French assistance to the National Government. (12th United Press Correspondent Tom Papson Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma claimed that the Japanese government is considering a reply to France's note of protest, delivered to Japan on January 5, regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, but "the reply will require a considerable amount of time." Suma said that the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was purely for strategic reasons and had nothing to do with Japanese-French treaties. Suma mocked reports from Shanghai that Japanese officials had issued an ultimatum to France demanding that France stop arms shipments on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, saying, "That news cannot be true." Suma continued, saying that the French are trying to convince the Japanese government that arms shipments on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway ceased months ago and do not want to formally protest the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Japan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Peace Rumors Flooding the Market</h3>
<p>In recent days, various rumors about peace between China and Japan have been circulating in the Shanghai market. Among them, those that are particularly rejoiced in by gentlemen who engage in zero-capital business are: that the ambassadors of England and other countries have successively gone to Chongqing with Japanese peace terms to persuade the Chinese; that bankers have received telegrams from London indicating that peace talks between China and Japan are in sight; that the market price of Chinese bonds in London has soared because peace terms have been agreed upon; and that foreigners believe that peace will be realized immediately, so Hong Kong capital is fleeing back to Shanghai. The various claims are so outlandish that they border on the mysterious, yet the talkers assert them with certainty. They certainly do not harbor any malice towards the country, and are not trying to undermine the will to resist Japan, but simply hope to seize an occasional good trading opportunity in the cracks.</p>
<p>Speculators are by no means devout pacifists or pillars of the peace movement, but only wish for changes in the status quo and for themselves to be the first to hear the news. Therefore, wherever speculators go, like the market, all kinds of rumors are spread irresponsibly and without concern for accuracy. Not only can it not be said that "there is no smoke without fire," there must be a reason. Moreover, they often contradict the facts. To believe that there is even a grain of truth in market "telegrams" is to be fooled. Market rumors are also not enough to be regarded as reflecting general psychology, to assume that such excitement in the market shows that people yearn for peace, because what they are excited about is trade, not about peace or war.</p>
<p>Amid the spread of various rumors, even people who are not in the market hear and are perplexed, unsure whether to believe or doubt, and running around asking questions. In fact, the overall situation of peace or war brooks no slightest ambiguity, and the key is extraordinarily clear. There is no need to ask, no need to say, only to open your eyes and look at the front lines, look at Chongqing and Tokyo. The war is on the front lines, so only when there are no more war reports from the front lines will there be signs of peace. The command for battle comes from Chongqing and Tokyo, so only when both Chongqing and Tokyo declare a ceasefire and make peace, or one side admits defeat and sues for peace, will the beginning of peace be at hand. Otherwise, no matter where, whether London, Washington, Geneva, or Peiping Nanjing, is filled with the air of peace, it is still useless, because those who control peace and war are not there but in Chongqing and Tokyo. No matter who advocates peace, promotes peace, or persuades for peace, if Chongqing and Tokyo do not accept it, it is still useless, and is only advocacy, promotion, and persuasion. Peace and war are not a posture but an action, not an opinion but a fact, not likes or dislikes, not an affirmation or opposition of right or wrong, but a choice and obedience to factual actions. If you see through this point, you will no longer be perplexed by any rumors.</p>
<p>Who loves war? In fact, no one loves war. Where there is war, there must be peace, so there will certainly be a day when peace is spoken of. There are people who seize the opportunity of war to profit, but only a whole, fair, and lasting peace can give the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. These few points can be believed as unbreakable truths! According to these truths, various rumors, various illusions, various brewing situations, and various situations can be accurately verified. One can know how to strive under the current situation. To strive under the current situation is not to seize a good trading opportunity in the cracks. Negatively speaking, one must endure sacrifice, so as to grasp the war in order to win a whole, fair, and lasting peace. Positively speaking, one must be diligent, hardworking and thrifty, so as to accumulate the strength remaining from the sacrifices, preparing for the great task of reconstruction after the realization of a whole, fair, and lasting peace. The rumors in the market these days are not worth considering; but the continuous and ongoing exposure of weaknesses by Japan in its international, domestic, and military affairs highlights the infinite brightness of China's future and suggests that the time for brightness is not far off. Because of this, not only can it be predicted that those who speculate and profit from war will face a crisis and that their doomsday is approaching, but it is also confirmed that diligence and thrift are important creeds!</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Japan at Home and Abroad, Abe Cabinet Inevitably Falls, Difficulty in Selecting Successor to Premiership, Konoe Expresses Unwillingness to Return to Office</h3>
<p>Tokyo: With Prime Minister Abe confirmed to resign within one or two days, people across the country are looking to senior officials to find a civilian politician who is willing and able to form a cabinet united by the entire country. It is heard that the military is strongly urging Konoe to take up the post of prime minister again, but Konoe is said to be unwilling. According to Konoe today, many people have visited him, urging him to take on this position, but their purposes are different. In his opinion, the resolution of the "China Incident" must proceed in parallel with domestic policies. However, given the current state of politics and the economy, he believes that greater attention needs to be given to domestic policies. Undoubtedly, the current situation is more difficult than when he was previously in the premiership. He does not know if it will become more and more difficult in the future. It is hoped that the new prime minister, whoever he may be, can form a cabinet that can cope with a long-term war and establish a powerful economic and industrial system based on a wartime economy. Possible candidates for prime minister include former Governor of the Bank of Japan, Ikeda in Bin, former Army Minister Araki, former Privy Councilor Suzuki Kantaro, former Prime Minister Hiranuma, and former Prime Minister Hirota Hiroki. Former Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Imperial Household, Ugaki Kazushige, has not been mentioned. It is heard that the military has expressed its opinion that it is not appropriate for an active-duty military officer to take this seat. It is expected that Abe will resign after holding a special cabinet meeting on Sunday morning or Sunday afternoon, after which senior officials will convene a meeting to decide on the successor. Most of the participants in this meeting are former prime ministers. The "Nikkan Shimbun" stated that the financial community is now watching carefully and believes that if a policy of fixing the minimum supply of daily necessities is not adopted as soon as possible, the problems of currency and prices will become increasingly serious. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Reuters has reliable sources that Prime Minister Abe informed each cabinet member this morning after the cabinet meeting of his intention to submit his cabinet resignation to the Emperor. It is likely that this will be realized on Sunday morning. It is heard that each cabinet member has agreed to let him handle everything. Furthermore, according to semi-official Japanese news, the Prime Minister told each cabinet member at this morning's cabinet meeting that the resolution of the China Incident has entered a new phase by Japan's formulation of its basic policy towards China and the new central government. He further urged that the government's administration be placed under a new system in order to revitalize the emotions of the people. This afternoon, the Prime Minister entered the Imperial Palace to report on the political situation to the Emperor and had a private discussion with Privy Seal Minister Yuasa about the political situation. It is rumored that the Prime Minister will enter the Imperial Palace after Sunday's cabinet meeting to discuss the situation with the Emperor, after which the most important political developments will follow. Yuasa may visit Elder Statesman Saionji on Sunday afternoon to seek his opinion on the political situation. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After Prime Minister Abe held a cabinet meeting today, he expressed his final determination to each cabinet minister. In the afternoon, he entered the palace and met with Interior Minister Yuasa, and also expressed this determination to Yuasa. However, judging from the current situation, the actions of former Prime Minister Duke Konoe are the focus of general attention. The overall opinion of the military is to hope that Duke Konoe can seek a renewal of the political situation, handle the incident, and strengthen the domestic economic system. In order to implement this hope, the military seems to be persisting in its efforts, and this is not only the effort of the military, but also the senior officials are expressing the same expectation to Duke Konoe. It is rumored that Interior Minister Yuasa frankly expressed this intention to Duke Konoe, and Baron Hiranuma also strongly stated to the upper echelons of the political world that in order to resolve the situation, there is no one other than Duke Konoe. Although there are also two or three other candidates in the political and financial circles, in view of the intentions of the military and important figures, the voices expecting Konoe to take office are gradually rising. Under these circumstances, the activities of various parties centered on Konoe are becoming more active. However, Konoe himself harbors some apprehension about breaking the deadlock, and is somewhat hesitant about taking office. It is doubtful whether he can comply with the almost unanimous expectations of various parties. However, the Duke's advance or retreat can be decided within these one or two days.

<h3>US Government Closely Watching Developments in Japanese Political Situation; Many US Senators Favor Sanctions Against Japan, Stimson's Calls Echoed in Public Opinion</h3>
<p>New York: The "New York Times" claimed yesterday that former US Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to the newspaper yesterday, requesting that the United States implement the proposal to ban the export of military raw materials to Japan, possessing "powerful and compelling reasons" for the embargo. The newspaper's editorial said, "The newspaper firmly believes that the majority of Americans share the same view as Stimson, that the Sino-Japanese war was 'wholly caused by Japanese aggression.'" (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: After former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to the New York Times advocating a ban on the shipment of munitions and raw materials to Japan, observers here said that Stimson served as Secretary of State for many years under former President Hoover, has rich diplomatic experience, and is a very influential figure in the Republican Party. The fact that this letter was published before the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty is sufficient to reflect the rising anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States. Therefore, the US government will definitely be deeply impressed. However, the State Department has consistently maintained silence regarding the current relations between the United States and Japan. For several weeks, although there have been rumors in Tokyo that US Ambassador to Japan Grew has been talking with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, the State Department has not formally announced the details of the exchange of views. Responsible persons said that the government's silence is not a sign of weakness or hesitation. The current US Far Eastern policy is still to promote respect for the various rights enjoyed by other countries under the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. This determination has increased rather than decreased in the past. The US authorities have recently received news from Japan that the Abe Cabinet is facing increasing difficulties. Under these circumstances, the US government should remain silent and take no action for the time being, so as to avoid completely closing the door for the US and Japan to dispel suspicions and make peace. After the US-Japan commercial treaty expires on the 26th of this month, the United States can ban munitions and other items from being shipped to Japan at any time, so there is no need to publicize it in advance. Moreover, judging from the Navy Department's request to Congress for funds to improve the dock facilities on Guam, in preparation for the island's defense, it can be seen that the United States has consistently paid attention to the Far Eastern situation, especially the Japanese issue. (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Many members of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee favor implementing economic sanctions against Japan, but are unwilling to take action before January 26. The proposals to the Foreign Affairs Committee regarding Japan are divided into four types, but most advocate some degree of trade cutoff with Japan. The proposal of Republican Congressman Leech is the most severe, advocating a complete severance of relations between the United States and Japan. At the same time, he hopes that Congress will quickly empower the President to immediately terminate exports to Japan and imports of Japanese goods until Japan withdraws from China. The proposal of Democratic Congressman Stearns calls for the State Department to reconvene the Brussels Nine-Power Treaty Conference to decide on measures to deal with Japan, and advocates terminating the current US-Japan commercial treaty. However, he also argues that the United States should remain neutral in Asia, otherwise it will become an ally of Britain and maintain its interests in the Far East. Furthermore, Democratic Congressman Coffee, usually regarded as the spokesman for the liberal group, advocates authorizing the President to prohibit American ships from sailing to Japan, prohibit American private groups from engaging in trade relations with Japan, or boarding Japanese ships or indirectly assisting Japan's aggression against China. Among them, only Republican Congressman Fisher advocates concluding a new commercial treaty with Japan, but Fisher also advocates terminating the mention of scrap iron, waste steel, and tin to Japan. (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Washington State Democratic Senator Schwellenbach said in a speech to the National Democratic Women's Association last night that "the US government" will stop trade with Japan after the US-Japan commercial treaty expires, as a sanction against Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty. If the United States stops supplying Japan with munitions and other items, the Japanese war against China will collapse within a few months. After January 26, we can also have an opportunity to wash away our own violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Stimson's Article Resented by Japanese</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today spoke at a regular press conference about a lengthy article by former US Secretary of State Stimson in the "New York Times" regarding the situation of the US-Japan treaty, and specifically criticized the passage in Stimson's article urging the United States to reject any movement to conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan until Japan makes more specific guarantees about its program in Asia. He said that Japan has clarified its purpose at any time when it is making every effort to safeguard the interests of third countries in China. Stimson's claim that American sentiment towards Japan is becoming increasingly negative is an exaggeration. Judging from the American opinions represented in the "New York Times" and the "New York Herald Tribune", they do not oppose the conclusion of a temporary commercial treaty with Japan, and the two newspapers even expressed the hope that a temporary commercial treaty would be concluded with Japan before the expiration of the existing commercial treaty on January 26.

<h3>Dr. Baker's Observation: The Sino-Japanese War Will Not End for Three Years; Victory Will Surely Belong to China</h3>
<p>New York. Dr. Baker, President of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, declared yesterday to the Church Committee for China Relief that the Sino-Japanese War would require another three years to end, and the need for relief funds would last even longer than that. Post-war reconstruction would be more important than the current relief efforts. The Japanese army has been fighting in China for thirty months, but it has not been able to establish any "occupied zones." Except for the areas where Japanese troops are stationed, all other parts of China are under the control of the National Government. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Analysis: Japan's Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>Chongqing. A dispatch from Moscow reports that the Soviet Red Army's newspaper published an article analyzing the economic difficulties of the Japanese army in the third year of its war of aggression against China. It claims that the war has led to a reduction in Japan's industrial production and foreign trade. In the first nine months of last year, Japan's foreign trade recorded a deficit of 400 million yen. Japan cannot profit from the European war because the war of aggression against China has already imposed significant economic pressure on Japan. Japan is not only unable to deliver goods ordered by European belligerents, but also needs to import machinery and raw materials from abroad to boost its wartime industries. The trend of declining cotton imports from India to Japan poses a major threat. After Vietnam adopted import restrictions, Japanese goods also failed to gain a market in Vietnam. As for trade with Africa and South America, it faces military risks and competition from Britain and the United States. The same is true for trade with India and Australia, as those markets are controlled by Britain. Negotiations for a new US-Japan commercial treaty are facing difficulties. Since the outbreak of the European war, Japan's reliance on the United States has only increased. In October 1939, imports from the United States accounted for 44% of Japan's total imports. The United States, aware of Japan's weakness, has made several demands regarding American interests in China, further strengthening its naval power in the Pacific and imposing an embargo on military supplies to Japan. In light of the above, Japan's foreign trade is in a very difficult situation. The recent statement by Toyotaro Yuki, Governor of the Bank of Japan, that Japan will prosper because of the war is unfounded. (Dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Pays Attention to Chinese Resistance Literature</h3>
<p>Chongqing. News from Moscow indicates that the Soviet people are very interested in various news from China and heroic stories of Chinese resistance against aggression. Soviet newspaper readers pay particular attention to the works of Chinese writers. Various Soviet literary magazines feature translations of Chinese poems, essays, and sketches in each issue. The most famous magazine, "Znamya," recently published a poem by Chinese writer Xiao Mei (transliteration) titled "Goodbye, but Not Farewell." This poem became popular in the Soviet Union for a time. "International Literature" magazine pays the closest attention to Chinese works. Its latest issue excerpted the book "North China Front" by the famous British reporter Halbert Anm. The publishing plan of the State Literary Publishing House also includes a large number of translations of Chinese works. The translation of "(A Chinese Woman)" is about to be published. The original author is Zhuang Zhou (transliteration), depicting the spirit of sacrifice of Chinese women on the front and rear lines. A new book by the young Chinese writer Luo Fanfu (transliteration), "Good Sons of China," is currently being translated. (Dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Denies Anti-American Movement</h3>
<p>Tianjin. It was reported from Peiping that the New People's Society is preparing to launch an anti-American movement in North China when the United States refuses to conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan. A reporter from the American Associated Press asked Nakayama, the Japanese Director of the Tianjin New People's Society, about this yesterday. According to Nakayama, the Tianjin New People's Society has not received such an order. Furthermore, "Why should we be anti-American? The United States has no malice towards China." Regarding the resurgence of anti-British sentiment in Tianjin, especially the anti-British films shown in cinemas, he also deflected responsibility, claiming that it was entirely the result of Chinese anti-British sentiment. It is reported that the posters commonly seen in Chinese cinemas depict Britain as a wolf, with the words "the most insidious, the most cunning, the most cruel wild beast," etc. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Widely Active Along the British Coast; Aiming to Discover Weaknesses in British Defenses; Preparing for Concentrated Attacks in the Future; Germans Claim Four British Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>London. German aircraft carried out extensive bombing raids on the east coast yesterday. Experts believe that the bombing was an organized and coordinated attack, and also the most extensive aerial activity since the start of the war. The German aerial activity aimed to discover weaknesses in British defenses, and then prepare for concentrated attacks in the future. According to the British War Office, the department now hopes to manufacture advanced aircraft, especially long-range aircraft, in order to protect the interests of bombers. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>London. Yesterday the weather was clear, and German planes flew to Britain in large numbers, covering a wider area than ever before since the start of the war. German planes crossed the coast at six locations, from Scotland to southeastern England, but did not drop bombs. British anti-aircraft batteries fired into the air, and fighter planes also took off to intercept them. A house near Newcastle was slightly damaged by anti-aircraft shrapnel. Coastal residents either took refuge in bomb shelters or left their homes to watch the aerial battle. The visibility was not very good, but black smoke from exploding shells could be seen in the sky.

The British plane soon returned, and a squadron of British bombers appeared over the coast and flew out to sea. Distant artillery fire could be heard faintly, and several planes were seen flying over various coastal cities in the area. A German plane, probably a Heinkel, flew over the Suffolk coast and was fired upon by anti-aircraft guns before withdrawing. In the evening, anti-aircraft batteries on both sides of the Thames Estuary in Kent and Essex opened fire on a plane, believed to be a German plane, flying at a very high altitude. The plane flew over the Essex coast and disappeared. In the morning, residents in central London heard artillery fire coming from the Thames Estuary. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>

It is expected that when they are deployed in battle in the future, they will achieve unexpected results, and their large numbers will be astounding. Recently, many members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords visited an airbase to watch an air force demonstration. At that time, a giant fighter plane appeared in the sky, moving like lightning and disappearing in an instant. This is the new type of fighter plane. In addition, the recent British air raids on the German seaplane base on the island of Borkum have been very successful, which shows the effectiveness of fighters with high speed and long range."

<h3>The United States Should Maintain a Strong Navy; To Back Britain and France When Necessary; Stark Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>Washington. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Navy, told the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday, "The United States must expand its military to prepare for the event that the Allies are defeated, to be used as a 'defense against strong enemies.'" Stark estimates that since the Munich Conference, U.S. naval defenses have increased, but since the outbreak of the European war, that need is even more "urgent."

<p>Washington. Congressman Magnuson delivered a speech to the Naval Affairs Committee yesterday afternoon, declaring that "the United States must have the strongest fleet in the world." He asked whether the currently planned military expansion could achieve this goal.

<h3>US Government Promotes Reciprocal Trade Agreement Policy; Hull Delivers Speech Strongly Defending It</h3>
<p>Washington. Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech to the House Rules Committee, strongly defending the government's policy of concluding trade agreements with various countries based on the principle of reciprocity, and requested that the government's privilege to sign such trade agreements be extended. He said, "We now have two paths to follow. One is to follow in the footsteps of other countries and head down the road to bankruptcy and disappointment. The other is to blaze a new trail, striving to benefit the progress, prosperity, and lasting peace of our country and all countries in the world." Regarding the "Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act" established in 1930, after Hull finished speaking, the members of the committee asked many questions, requesting answers. The most important question was whether the burden on domestic producers would be increased after the United States made many concessions in tariff rates under this trade agreement. However, judging from the overall situation of today's debate, most of the members were arguing with each other based on party affiliation, and not purely discussing the value of the policy. Because the general election is approaching, the remarks of the members of various parties are more excited than usual. (Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<h3>Reports of Hitler Preparing to Mediate the Soviet-Finnish War to Simultaneously Preserve Friendships with Italy and the Soviet Union, and to Prevent Britain and France from Sending Troops to Northern Europe; Italy Denies Volunteer Soldiers Have Arrived in Finland to Assist in Combat</h3>
<p>London, from a correspondent of the Daily Express stationed in the Dutch capital: Hitler is currently pressuring Stalin to present peace terms to Finland. He states that if the Soviet Union is willing to comply, he is prepared to step in and mediate. It is said that the Soviet government responded by stating that if the Soviet Union could acquire naval bases on the Finnish coast, gain the right to utilize the northern Finnish port of Petsamo, and revise certain border lines with Finland, then negotiations could proceed, and the plan to conquer Finland could be abandoned. According to the correspondent, Hitler's actions are intended to achieve three objectives: First, a peaceful settlement between Finland and the Soviet Union is the only way to simultaneously preserve the friendships between Italy and the Soviet Union with Germany. Second, Hitler believes that Britain and France will use the Finnish war as a pretext to send troops and transport armaments to the Scandinavian Peninsula, and he wants to avoid this. Third, Germany urgently needs raw materials from the Soviet Union, but this will be impossible if the Finnish-Soviet war continues. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The first unit of Italian volunteer soldiers fighting for Finland has arrived here and will be named the "Garibaldian Legion." There is now credible reason to believe that some Soviet troops have been surrounded in northern Finland. Finnish ski patrol teams have severed several key routes between Salla and Kemihaave to Samihaave, trapping approximately 18,000 Soviet soldiers 20 miles ahead of the cut-off points. Finnish forces are advancing on both sides and in the center, placing the Soviet troops in a clear disadvantage. It is reported that 35,000 to 40,000 Soviet reinforcements are now departing from the railway terminus in Kandalaksha, rapidly moving to provide support. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to various Italian sources, the rumor that a group of Italian volunteer soldiers, named the Garibaldian detachment, arrived here yesterday from Italy to assist Finland in its resistance is not true. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London: A shipment of Italian munitions, transported by Germany to Finland, was detained en route by German authorities. It was later returned after Italian protest. Political figures here commented on this matter, noting that it is worth observing whether Italy is sending munitions to Finland through other routes and to what extent Italy is maintaining an independent stance regarding the German-Soviet alliance. In their view, Italy's rhetoric of aiding Finland is merely to defend its position as a pillar against Bolshevism, hoping to attract the Balkan Peninsula countries. Regarding Italian volunteers going to Finland to assist in combat, it is confirmed that this is happening, and several dozen have arrived in Finland, but so far, the total number is only several hundred. The direction of Italy's current foreign policy remains ambiguous. Some pessimists even believe that Italy is using the pretense of pursuing an anti-Bolshevik policy to attract Southeast European countries as much as possible, gradually distancing them from Western European countries. This action may have been instigated by Germany. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: At this time of resistance and national reconstruction, in order to enhance the transportation and sales of agricultural products and adjust supply and demand, before the establishment of a cooperative union system, it is extremely necessary to improve and promote the cooperation, sales, and agency businesses and organizations in various provinces.

<h3>Currency System in Guangzhou Becomes Increasingly Chaotic</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: Amid the disturbances caused by the currency situation, ten rice shops were looted yesterday afternoon. The situation caused by merchants refusing to accept Guangdong Province banknotes and the exchange rate of legal tender being only 60% of the Japanese military scrip has not improved today. Currently, only rice shops accept legal tender, but at double the price. According to sources here, this trend is due to manipulation by Chinese individuals to prevent legal tender from falling into Japanese hands and being used to purchase foreign exchange.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Guangdong Commit Atrocities of Forced Labor Recruitment, Causing Extreme Harassment in Nanhai, Sanshui, and Huaxian Counties; Tens of Thousands of People Have Been Recruited from Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: The Japanese troops invading Guangdong have recently been severely lacking soldiers, unable to replenish their forces. Adding to this their ambition of seizing Shaoguan, they are conducting large-scale recruitment of forced laborers to drive them to work. However, most of those recruited are unwilling, leading to repeated tragic incidents. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Various Counties:</p>
<p>Japanese troops in Jiujiang, Taiping, and other areas have forcibly recruited over a hundred farmers from Jizan, Dagang Market, and other places since early December. They continue to appear in various villages from time to time, arresting and forcibly returning to the military headquarters any shepherd boys or farmers working in the fields and sandbanks. During this harvest season, farmers, due to their livelihoods, have no choice but to desperately harvest rice. Whenever Japanese troops arrive, they abandon their crops and flee. Among those who are unable to escape and are forcibly recruited, it is estimated that over three hundred people have been taken from various areas of Nanhai County between the 18th and 20th. In Sanshui County, during the market days in places such as Dagao Market and Xicheng Market, many villagers attend the market. Unexpectedly, Japanese troops suddenly arrived and surrounded the market, forcibly recruiting any strong young men they encountered. People scrambled to escape, and shops hurriedly closed, causing great disorder. It is estimated that over fifty people were taken from Dagao Market and thirty people were taken from Xicheng Market. The Japanese troops tied the hands of those recruited with long ropes and escorted them back towards Taiping. Japanese naval vessels in Jiujiang also frequently sailed to Shatou, Zhoucun, Longchi Ouxiang, and other places to harass the population. Currently, in various areas of Nanhai and Sanshui counties, the residents are in a constant state of fear. On the Guanghua Highway line, in areas such as Nicheng and Xiaogang, the Japanese troops also conducted large-scale arrests of strong men and women from various villages. The plainclothes unit of the Chinese army's Ye Department, upon learning of this, immediately divided into four groups and launched a tight encirclement and ambush of Nicheng and other places. The Japanese troops were suddenly attacked and fled hastily towards Xicun, abandoning dozens of rifles and suffering dozens of casualties. The Chinese side sacrificed only a few people. Afterwards, the Japanese troops fled to Nicheng, claiming to be searching for guerrillas, and arrested dozens of civilians from nearby villages, taking them back to the city for interrogation. Currently, the Japanese troops have extremely strict precautions in various villages in the area.</p>
<p>Regarding Guangzhou:</p>
<p>The Japanese troops' recruitment of forced labor has been ongoing for nearly a month, and the number of people recruited has reached tens of thousands, with an unlimited demand. As a result, the residents of Guangzhou dare not leave their homes, and the city presents an even more desolate and desolate scene. Recently, with no one left to recruit in the city, they have turned to recruiting in various rural areas during market days, causing the temporary suspension of market days in nearby rural areas. However, as the Japanese troops need a certain number of forced laborers daily, on the 15th, they dispatched a large number of Japanese troops to villages such as Chaju and Shanzhai in Huadi to forcibly recruit, taking a total of over two hundred villagers. On the 16th, they again dispatched troops to Yuanxi, Xichang, Zengbu, Sanyuanli, Sanshengtang, and other places to forcibly recruit, taking a total of over one hundred and seventy villagers. As a result, when the villages hear that Japanese troops are approaching, they seek ways to escape, leaving the chickens and dogs unsettled. Harvesting in the countryside is now done by female laborers, and men dare not cultivate in the fields. In the Guangzhou market, street vendors have now uniformly been replaced by women carrying babies on their backs to sell goods on the roads. The reason for carrying babies on their backs is to prevent even female workers who are considered strong from being recruited. It is feared that the situation will become increasingly severe. From the 18th, it became even more intense. On the evening of the 19th, the Japanese troops suddenly issued an order to the puppet Guangzhou Municipal Police Department, requiring them to recruit eight thousand strong men within two days and hand them over to the Gendarmerie Headquarters for distribution and use. After receiving the order, the puppet police department immediately ordered all nineteen puppet police stations in the city, as well as their respective self-defense corps, to dispatch puppet police and supervise the self-defense teams to recruit the required number within the time limit. As a result, an unprecedented tragic scene of forced labor recruitment began on the morning of the 18th. After dawn on the 18th, the puppet police and self-defense teams set out in different directions, searching and forcibly recruiting on major roads and in places where laborers often gather, such as fish and vegetable markets. However, after repeated forced labor recruitment in the city in recent days, the residents have become like frightened birds. Ordinary people generally do not go out unless necessary, and even general street vendors would rather endure hunger than temporarily hide in their homes to avoid being forcibly recruited. Only a portion of those who have reached the end of their rope and can no longer endure venture out to earn a living, but they do so with trepidation, constantly guarding against recruitment, or taking more secluded inner streets. Unexpectedly, the puppet police, in order to shirk their responsibilities, set up a tight net and intercepted people everywhere, so even those who take detours cannot escape. Around 9:00 AM, those recruited were being escorted back to the puppet police stations. The wives and children of those recruited, upon hearing the news, wailed in front of the puppet police stations, pleading for their release. Others met on the road, clinging to their clothes and crying in sorrow, a scene so tragic that even those with hearts of stone would shed tears. The puppet police ignored them and forcibly took them away. If they encountered Japanese troops, they would be severely beaten. For a time, the entire city was shrouded in sorrow. Due to the spread of rumors, most men dared not walk in the city. The streets were mostly filled with women. By the afternoon of the 18th, the puppet police, seeing that there was no one left to recruit on the streets and that the number of eight thousand had not yet been reached, began to forcibly recruit from shops. The Japanese troops also supervised the forced recruitment. As a result, most shops closed their doors and stopped operating, and many tea houses also closed. The streets were desolate, and pedestrians disappeared. The puppet police then waited on the outskirts and the Bund for villagers entering the city from various villages and for those returning from elsewhere, and forcibly recruited them. As a result, even fish and vegetable vendors dared not go out to buy or sell, and most food supplies disappeared from the market. Except for frail women and children, there were hardly any men to be seen on the streets. By the 20th, the Japanese and puppet troops were still recruiting forced labor as they had on the 18th and 19th. However, as the news had spread to various villages in the neighboring provinces, those coming to Guangzhou also disappeared. The entire Guangzhou resembled a dead city. By 4:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet soldiers and police who had been dispatched to recruit forced labor began to withdraw. In front of each puppet police station, signs were posted with words such as "The quota of forced labor has been met, recruitment has stopped." The residents, initially fearing that it was a trick to lure them out for forced recruitment, still warned each other not to go out. Later, seeing that there were no Japanese and puppet troops on the streets, they cautiously ventured out to buy necessities. Around 5:00 PM, a small number of shops reopened for business. After this three-day large-scale forced labor recruitment, the residents, realizing that it was difficult to stay in the tiger's den, moved elsewhere. Those who had just returned to Guangzhou from elsewhere moved away again. Therefore, on the 21st, the number of people leaving Guangzhou was endless. It is reported that the thousands of people who were recruited were transported elsewhere by ship, but it is not known exactly where they were taken.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to those who escaped from Guangzhou, "Since the outbreak of the war in southern Guangdong, the Japanese troops in Guangzhou have begun recruiting forced labor and have not stopped until recently. I was fortunate enough to escape from the tiger's den this time and come safely to Hong Kong, which is truly a stroke of luck. In this recruitment of forced labor by the Japanese troops, regardless of men, women, old, or young, all are on the list to be recruited. Since the beginning, no fewer than forty or fifty thousand men and women have been recruited. Some are driven to southern Guangdong and Guangxi to transport supplies, while others are driven to the front lines in the northwest and the Yangtze River to build defensive works and transport military supplies. I was recruited two months ago and served as a coolie. The recruited citizens are not given any wages, and the two meals a day are only the leftover cold rice that the Japanese troops eat on the battlefield. They are constantly hungry. In addition to enduring hunger to build defensive works, when there is an intrusion or a counter-offensive by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops use machine guns to supervise them from behind, driving these unarmed coolies to the front lines to serve as cannon fodder. If anyone retreats, they are shot with machine guns. Whether they advance or retreat, they will die. The Japanese troops used this inhuman method in the northern invasion of Sanhui and Luba in Guangdong and in several battles in southern Guangdong. The Japanese and puppet troops call this 'meat fortress' to make the Chinese army have concerns and disrupt the target in order to prolong their lives. This shows one aspect of the Japanese troops' long-term war. In recent battles in the northwest, the Yangtze River, and southern Guangdong, countless civilians have been sacrificed in this way. There are even more unspeakable atrocities. Currently, the forced laborers recruited by the Japanese troops in Guangzhou and the occupied areas, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are subjected to torture if they resist or try to escape. Among the tens of thousands of people recruited in Guangzhou, at least a thousand have been slaughtered by them," he said.</p>
<h3>Order in Changshu City Has Not Yet Been Restored</h3>
<p>According to someone who came from Changshu City, it is confirmed that the county seat has been fully open since the 6th, but the Japanese troops, after this attack, are extremely fearful. Therefore, wherever there is a Japanese garrison, sandbags are added. The order in the shops in the city has not yet been restored after this five-day city closure and thorough search. The shops are desolate and the situation is very bleak, as the residents are unwilling to enter the city easily. As for the Japanese troops' casualties, they themselves announced one death and one injury. One of the guerrilla fighters who first launched the attack was disguised as a hunchback and immediately entered Dushu Lane after the attack, escaping by climbing the mountain. Therefore, during the thorough search, the Japanese troops arrested all the hunchbacks inside and outside the city and searched the residents near the foot of Yushan Mountain and the North Gate. Some of those arrested have been released, but a person from a certain village who sells chaff was detained in the city. When he went to the city wall to look for a boat, he was spotted by the Japanese troops, who thought he was related to the attack, and tied him up. First, they burned his hair, and then they burned a red-hot iron skewer and pierced his mouth and nose. Although he has been sent to the guard team, he has been severely tortured and is in danger of losing his life. This proves the cruelty of the Japanese troops' methods.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong News) After the promulgation of the new school regulations, the entire Hong Kong education sector is in a state of anxiety and concern. In recent days, the health authorities have been sending personnel to inspect various schools and record the points that do not comply with the regulations, making the school authorities even more uneasy. However, according to Director of Education So Li Shi, the government will give existing schools a considerable grace period and will not order them to close as soon as it discovers that they violate the regulations. The government has specially dispatched Chang to inspect various schools to see if there are any violations of the regulations. If there are any violations, a formal order will be issued to improve them and a reasonable amount of time will be given to comply. If they still do not improve, then the law will be enforced. However, schools newly established from January 1, 1940, that cannot fully comply with the new regulations will not be able to register and open. It is understood that in order to train teachers, the Hong Kong authorities established the Hong Kong Teacher Training Institute last year, enrolling 50 students, divided into 25 male and 25 female students. High school graduates are eligible to apply for the examination. Once selected, tuition and book fees are waived, and the government provides each person with a monthly subsidy of 20 yuan. In addition, from this year, the Wan Chai Lee Garden Street Women's Normal School will be transformed into the Eastern District Women's Middle School, with the same principal and no major changes to the faculty. It is reported that the government authorities are determined to cultivate as many teachers as possible to lay the foundation for future improvements in education in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Securities: Jardine Matheson Shares at Unprecedented High / Domestic and Foreign Debts Slightly Flat and Weak</h3>

Prices eventually rebounded by a small two to four jiao, with total turnover of approximately six to seven hundred thousand yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 40 shares of Xinxin Company changed hands at a price of 6.2 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no upward or downward movement in HSBC's listed prices. The gray market conditions for British and American exchange rates remained consistently mediocre, with thin trading.

Subsequently, an importer also settled with Datong Bank and other American banks for March U.S. dollars 7.625 and April U.S. dollars 7.5.

A certain money changer bought 10 liang from a fellow trader for 4,086 yuan. Later, the jewelry firm sold 20 yuan to the securities firm for 4,084 yuan. After this, the securities firm continued to absorb, and then raised the price by 6 yuan. The securities firm bought 20 liang from the gold firm for 4,090 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange stopped tightening and tended to flatten, and the gold firm came to sell out again, and the securities firm also changed from buying to selling, so it fell. The securities firm sold 30 liang to the money changer for 4,087 yuan, making the noon closing price. The afternoon situation was quieter. First, it rose 2 yuan, and the money changer bought 10 liang from Yu Hao for 4,087 yuan.

The current standard price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and trading was rare.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per liang has remained unchanged throughout. Datong Bank is still holding at 410 yuan, and the new dealer's price is the same as the previous price, with a reduction of about 15 yuan in the buying price.</p>
<h3>Gauze Yarn: Fuda Monopoly, Gauze Prices Unsustainable, Double Horse Drops Another 15 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gauze market is sluggish, and the downward trend is intensifying. The actual reason is that the sales channels for spot gauze are narrow, leading to a daily increase in inventory. Although the bulls are holding on tightly, buying and selling still struggle to break free from the market. Now, the American and Indian cotton markets are reacting and declining, making the bulls even more anxious. The market situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable. In this regard, it may be difficult to maintain the 700 yuan mark for 20-count Double Horse gauze. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, general hand-held goods will inevitably be sold off.</p>
<p>Spot silk opened this morning with a renewed downward trend due to the weakness of the European and American cotton markets. There were many sellers in the market. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 711 yuan, a slight drop to 710 yuan. Later, with the support of the bulls, there was a slight recovery, rising to 714.5 yuan. However, because the actual position could not progress, it lingered for a long time. By the time the market closed, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was stable and Fuda was releasing its holdings. The downward trend for 20-count Double Horse gauze resumed, falling to 708 yuan at the close. According to statistics, the total transaction volume for half a day was 1,465 bales. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 15 yuan, Heavenly Girl fell by 15 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 14 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below: Fellow traders 1,300, Hong Kong 140, Ningbo 10, Mainland 15, Total 1,465.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Follows Foreign Market Downturn, Transactions Also Exceptionally Quiet</h3>
<p>Local cotton trading is becoming increasingly quiet, and transactions among fellow traders are also decreasing. The reason is that the firm American and Indian cotton markets suddenly experienced a downturn, causing sentiment to decline accordingly. At the same time, factory demand is weak, and cotton yarn demand is stagnant, with selling prices declining daily. The supply from Northern Jiangsu includes 300 bales of Tonghua cotton, 236 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 620 bales of Beisha cotton. The opening prices for spot cotton are listed below: Taicang cotton 167.00, Guangqin imported 285 bales of Pingguo cotton 165.00, fellow traders imported 150 pieces of Tongcao bales 164.00, fellow traders imported 200 bales of Huocao bales 158.00, fellow traders imported 200 bales of Huoda bales 169.00, Yuan Yi imported 150 pieces of Cao bales 160.00, fellow traders imported 250 bales.</p>
<p>In other news, the New York cotton market has been relatively weak recently. At the opening this morning, the market fell due to speculation and selling. Later, it fell again due to the sharp decline in stock prices and selling by overseas merchants. As a result, the closing price fell by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than ten rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than thirty rupees. Liverpool cotton fell by more than ten pence.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market is becoming increasingly depressed. All parties are unwilling to purchase, resulting in a dead market. Although fellow traders have some interest, they are afraid to take risks due to the huge exchange rate risks. In addition, factory demand is non-existent, so everyone is hesitant to move forward. Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. However, it is generally expected that foreign cotton trading may turn around in recent days. The factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at a US exchange rate of 7.85, are as follows: 20-count American Middling 228.20, 20-count American Middling Below Grade 223.95, 32-count American Middling 240.50, 32-count American Middling Below Grade 234.70, 42-count American Middling 245.20, 42-count American Middling Below Grade 236.95.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Unstable Due to Frequent Obstructions to Deliveries</h3>
<p>After the rice market shifted to a fluctuating situation, the opening yesterday was still relatively stable. The reason is that there were still few out-of-town merchants selling, and few buyers were purchasing. Although deliveries from the interior arrived daily, the number was not as large as in the previous week, only four to five hundred bags. Moreover, they had to be transferred out of Hongkou, and recently there had been some difficulties, making the amount seem even smaller. Yesterday, it was heard that the issue had been resolved, and that goods could be transferred by river from the Huangpu River. As a result, there were many sellers in the market, with no less than one to two thousand bags of early and late rice from the Southern ports, and thin rice, etc. However, most of them were from the Datong and middle sections, and there were very few special grades. Therefore, general stores were urgently in need of high-quality goods, and their demand for lower-quality goods was only so-so. Moreover, the buying interest was still difficult to loosen quickly. Therefore, domestic rice, whether it was thin粳 or 变元 rice, remained mediocre from morning to noon, with little fluctuation. Only after the foreign rice became tight did it slightly increase by two or three 角. As for various types of foreign rice, the market has recently been dominated by large quantities, so although the morning market was once calm, the sales market suddenly became lively after hearing that the foreign exchange rate had shrunk again. The original bagged goods remained firm and were not released. Only some recycled goods were exchanged between each other. In the absence of sufficient supply, buyers slightly increased their prices to search for goods, which led to an upward trend.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was still in a flat position in the morning. Later, due to the failure to transport goods unloaded at Hongkou as usual, and the frequent price increases reported from abroad, the market sentiment was mostly upward. New transactions were not properly settled, and recycled original bags were not close. The current foreign rice market has turned from weak to strong, and the market outlook is expected to be two or three 角 higher. However, the demand in this street is very weak, and the rural merchants lack a smooth appetite. The previously ordered goods are still arriving at the port one after another. Yesterday, more than 5,000 bags arrived on the Aksel vessel, and one or two more ships are expected to arrive within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Rise Unabated, Wholesale Prices in This Street Rise Another Two 角, Wheat Reaches Unprecedented High Price</h3>
<p>After the wholesale price of flour from Paoche 客盘 reached the 10 yuan mark, each factory once again increased the wholesale price in this street by another two 角 yesterday, changing it to 9.60 yuan. Although the price for 客盘 has not been increased on the surface, the supply has actually been restricted. Therefore, after the 客销 market was once active the day before yesterday, it suddenly turned quiet again yesterday. The environment in the flour market is becoming increasingly favorable. In the midst of the soft rice prices, I never expected the flour prices to rise even faster. The 10 yuan flour price has already been seen, and I don't know what the bottom will be. This is all due to the temporary difficulty in ordering foreign wheat from abroad, and the repeated increases in the selling price of domestic wheat. It is heard that the current flour of the Japanese factory Phoenix brand has also increased by two 角. The futures market has been suspended due to unresolved disputes over buying and selling. Today, 6,500 white bags of flour were exported to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Building Materials: Water and Wood Materials All Rise in Price</h3>
<p>The reasons are reduced supply, increased fuel prices, and the sudden interception of bricks, tiles, and lime. Since the New Year, building materials have generally been more expensive than last year. Due to the many affairs in Europe, the number of ships has decreased and freight rates have increased. Major companies such as Xiangtai are afraid that there will be problems with European freight in the future, and they are unwilling to sell off their Shanghai inventory at low prices and are increasing prices. Various firms are still competing to sell in order to seek the flow of funds, so the market price has not yet reached its peak. The former supply of local pine and fir was cut off, and the Shanghai inventory was limited, so prices rose again and again. Their prices are almost equivalent to those of foreign pine. Although there are occasional arrivals, the number is very small, and the freight is quite high, which is a drop in the bucket and does not help the matter. Moreover, the cost has increased, resulting in a situation of rising prices without falling prices. Most hardware items are foreign goods. Although there has been a lot of construction in Shanghai recently, most of them are ordinary residences. There are few giant buildings and high-rise buildings. The purchasing power of heavy materials and large materials is not weak. Moreover, with the improvement of foreign exchange rates, the market price should have tended to decline. Now, the opposite is true. Not only has it not fallen, but it has also risen. The reason is also due to the deteriorating situation in Europe, and people are optimistic. Both domestic and foreign traders are hoarding and waiting for a good price. The prices of bricks, tiles, and lime were originally raised due to rising fuel prices. The reason for the extraordinary prices is due to the large-scale monopoly of a certain party. Two to three hundred large and small boats of water and wood materials were intercepted in the suburbs of Shanghai. What is the intention? It is unknown. Although this new high price has been created in the market, the goods in the market are still very small. The initial increase in the price of cement was due to the increase in the price of coal. Then, due to the decrease in supply, demand exceeded supply, and sellers took the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing the price to rise again and again, breaking all historical records. (Le)</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market was even more expensive yesterday, with the highest price reaching a peak of 17 yuan, which is unprecedented. Various circumstances have created this situation. It is heard that the Huachang purchasing plate has been widened to 16.60 yuan, but sellers are still unwilling to sell more. As a result, only one or two thousand bags were opened. It is estimated that the market hoarding households received about three or four cars, and the selling price has reached a peak of 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Are Rare and Expensive</h3>
<p>Soybeans are in short supply due to insufficient supply. Only a small number of Wuhu Road soybeans can be used, which is of no help. Moreover, high-quality goods are extremely scarce. Therefore, Zhongguan goods have been improving in the past two days. High-quality soybeans are rather sluggish, and it is difficult to handle due to the high price. Although there were Dingjiazhou soybeans opened at 20 yuan in the market yesterday, the number was only dozens of bags (sold by the vegetable vendors in this street). The industry does not regard it as a formal market. However, judging from the strong bullish air in all parties at the moment, it will only be a matter of time before Zhongguan soybeans are bought at 20 yuan. Yesterday, the total market included more than 1,000 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans (the price is detailed in the market price column), two cars of Wuhu soybeans, five cars of Nanjing soybeans, and 300 bags of Qingdao soybeans. Yesterday, 180 bags of soybeans were brought from Beisha.</p>
<h3>Coal: Temperature Charcoal Recovers Slightly, Haimen Charcoal Still Holds Firm</h3>
<p>Since the large arrival of new goods of Wenzhou charcoal, people's hearts have been settled, and the market has gradually recovered. The wholesale price of Grade A charcoal of 50 pounds is 11.50 yuan per load, and the price for customers from the shops is 6.50 yuan per basket. However, the source of Haimen Pingmao charcoal is not much, and the price is still firm. The price for goods at the wharf is still around 8 yuan per load. Some Dongpi hoarding households have been selling off their holdings.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Factories Rush to Weave Ordered Goods</h3>
<p>The cloth market has slightly declined because yarn prices are falling daily and dyeing factories are slowly advancing. Hoarding households of grey cloth are releasing their holdings. However, domestic and foreign sales are still strong. Factories are rushing to weave ordered goods, and the remaining amount only accounts for a small number. Therefore, the downward trend is slow. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth fell by 2.5 角. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by 5 角. Only the selling plates of the two factories, Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang, are relatively stable. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi merchants handled more than 100 pieces of Feng cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. The Fujian merchants handled more than 120 pieces of already-slanting serge. The Yanjin merchants handled more than 100 boxes of blue cloth and other goods. More than 11,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, floral cloth, and poplin were handled abroad in Siam and other places. 1,600 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 12th, and 430 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>Dongbu: The market fell in the morning and recovered at noon, with the market situation erratic. In the morning, the spot demand was weak, and the opening price of fine cloth futures from foreign firms suddenly dropped, causing a part of the small hoarders to gradually show panic and reluctantly sell off. The low plate price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 20.30 yuan. The price of Sijunzi Yuan serge was sold at 6 角 5 分 7 厘 半. Later, Tianjin merchants rose up and handled fine cloth, with a very healthy appetite, purchasing more than 1,000 pieces of various spot and futures brands. The market situation was tight again. The highest price of Longtou recovered to 21.7 角 半, and the closing price was 21.6 角. The price of Longtou fine diagonal was 21.2 角 半, which was only a difference of 5 分 角 per piece compared to the previous day. However, the number of fine cloth opened by foreign firms in the long term was also about 1,000 pieces, and the price was cheap, which has an impact. The made-up prices for Longdian fine cloth in the following month are 22 yuan, Yanghe 21.9 角, and Feiyu in the current month 21.8 角.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Pianqing Opens at 43 Yuan</h3>
<p>The sugar market did not fluctuate much yesterday. The current price of 24 rough white sugar set by the association was 56.50 yuan for goods in this warehouse, 57.10 yuan for newly arrived goods in the foreign warehouse, 56.40 yuan for old goods, and 45.50 yuan for transit goods. The price of Taikoo Che Bai 嘜 in the Dong warehouse was 58 yuan, and the price in the West warehouse was 58.50 yuan. The rest were all quoted at the original price. The price of Dutch Red MP 嘜 was 45 yuan, and the price of oil bags was 44 yuan. There was no movement in local cotton white and local ice. The national refined sugar market was tighter, but there were not many transactions. The reason is that the firms do not want to buy and store because the price is already high. Yesterday, the Guangdong merchants only opened 85 bags of Shimen Pianqing, and the price was 43 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Chinese and Foreign Silk Prices Are Both Weak</h3>
<p>The Japanese and American silk markets continued to decline. New York recently fell by 7.5 分, and the distant period fell by 1 角 3 分 5. Yokohama spot prices fell by 40 yuan in the morning, and by 60 yuan at the afternoon close. The distant period fell by 65 yuan. The market was closed in the afternoon. The Shanghai silk market was more sluggish. The 78-point average of white factories opened at 9,800 yuan yesterday, which was less than 500 yuan higher than the high price recorded a month ago. Dachang and others imported 20 loads, and Qianjin also traded 40 loads at the same price as the previous market.</p>

<h3>After the Wangdian Train Bombing Incident: Japanese Troops Brutally Abuse Innocent Shanghai-Hangzhou Passengers, Subjected to Strict Inspections, Political Work Team Members Suffered Torture, Half of Shendang Town Has Been Turned to Ashes</h3>
<p>According to visitors from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, since the Japanese military freight train was destroyed by a landmine near Wangdian, there are still six bombed vehicles left beside the tracks. The Japanese troops have vented their anger on the passengers. Passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou trains are subjected to inspections, which are extremely strict. Passengers in the train must immediately take off their clothes, as well as all their luggage and other items, and open their boxes and untie their knots to be inspected. Men and women are treated the same way. Any delay in action will be beaten immediately. Yesterday, female passengers on two trains were unaware of the situation and were slightly late in opening their packages. The inspectors immediately picked up the huge package and threw it at the top of their heads several times.</p>
<p>All the passengers dared to be angry but dared not speak. Near Yuanhua in Xiashi, there is Fengjiaqiao, where more than ten male and female members of the political work team dispatched by the Commissioner's Office are stationed. It is not known how the Japanese troops detected it. They suddenly surrounded the area, and all the male and female team members were arrested by the Japanese troops, who whipped them indiscriminately. The pure-minded female team members were forcibly humiliated and trampled on. After being trampled on, they and the male team members were</p>
<p>perforated through their palms</p>
<p>and connected with a rope, so that they could walk together. When one person moved, the rope pulled on the connected palms, and all the palms rubbed painfully, and the sound of miserable screams was sour to the nose. They were taken to Jiaxing for execution. Anyone who was suspected by the Japanese troops of being a spy or a plainclothes team member was continuously poured water into their mouths and noses with a bucket, and their stomachs were as swollen as a five-stone gourd, and feces flowed out of their mouths.</p>
<p>suffocating and hoarse</p>
<p>Until they surrendered, the Japanese troops did not stop. It was also heard that some of the Japanese troops stationed in Yuanhua were stationed in Lu's residence. The Lu family was rich and had a lot of silver dollars buried. They were all dug up by the Japanese troops. It was heard that the silver dollars were exchanged on the spot at a price of 2.30 法币 per dollar. The Japanese troops went to Shendang again the day before yesterday and set fire to thousands of houses in the town. Shendang, formerly known as a major town, is now half-destroyed by the fire of robbery.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Police Authority: Continued Negotiations, Still No Possibility of Approaching</h3>
<p>The工部局has repeatedly contacted and negotiated with the "Municipal Government" on the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, but there have been no specific results. The工部局is still working hard to continue the negotiations. Although Mr. Filipo, the director and president of the工部局, was suddenly attacked on the 6th of this month, he was lucky enough to escape unharmed. However, Mr. Fei did not take it to heart and still focused on the police authority negotiations for road construction beyond the border. At about 4 p.m. on the 11th, Mr. Fei and Mr. Fankling, the director of the工部局, visited Bo Xiao'an at his residence on Shigaota Road in Hongkou. It was heard that the matter discussed was still the above issue, but it was heard that there was still no possibility of approaching on both sides.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Chongming Maru Sinks After Being Bombed, Loss is Quite Heavy, 22 People Missing</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese troops occupied the areas along the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River shipping routes have not been opened on the pretext of military relations, and only Japanese ships are allowed to travel back and forth. Foreign ships from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Italy have been obstructed. Recently, although the Japanese side announced the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it has not yet been realized. According to a Daguang News Agency reporter's investigation into the shipping industry, the Japanese "East Asia Shipping Company's" Chongming Maru was operating between Wuhu and Hankou, specializing in passengers and cargo. Because there were no foreign ships competing, the business was extremely developed. The ship departed from Wu on the morning of the 10th to Han. At 11 o'clock, on the river surface about 30 miles away from Hankou, it suddenly touched an explosive, and the bottom of the ship was blown open with a loud noise, and the ship sank accordingly. Afterwards, the Japanese steamship Taomaru rushed to the rescue, but 22 Japanese crew members and passengers were missing. It is believed that they have all drowned. It is heard that the ship was loaded with a lot of rice and military supplies, and the loss was extremely heavy.</p>
<h3>Eighth Installment of Principal and Interest of the Unified Public Bond: Shanghai Market Pays Exchange Transfer Tickets, Four Banks Decide to Discount and Pay, Shanghai Still Pays in Six Installments</h3>
<p>In order to unify the names of bonds and exchange and compensate for the old bonds of various types, the National Government issued the Unified Public Bond of the Republic of China in 1936, with five types of bonds A, B, C, D, and E, totaling 146.6 million national currency, using the customs surplus as the fund for repaying the principal and interest. Since the customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15 last year on the method of repaying the principal and interest in the future. However, in order to maintain the credit of domestic debt, the four banks, China, China, Communications, and Farmers, agreed to discount and pay the due principal and interest. The funds for the seventh repayment of principal and payment of interest have been discounted by the four banks and paid from July 31 of last year. However, Shanghai was paid off in six installments and has already been fully paid by the end of last year.</p>
<p>fully paid off</p>
<p>Regarding the eighth installment of principal repayment lottery, it has been carried out by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The total amount of each bond that has been drawn, as well as the interest due, is 56,476,600 yuan. According to the regulations, the payment date is January 31. According to an investigation by a Xinsheng News Agency reporter yesterday to the Shanghai branches of the four banks and the National Debt Fund Management Committee, although the order to discount and pay has not been received from the headquarters of the four banks regarding the eighth repayment of principal and payment of interest of the Unified Public Bond, it has been decided to</p>
<p>follow the last time</p>
<p>The method of discounting and paying will be used. Shanghai will still be paid off in six installments, and the exchange transfer notes commonly used in the Shanghai market will be paid.</p>
<h3>Felipp Will Leave Shanghai, British Expats Bid Farewell</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Sir Philip, the British Consul General, has now retired and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge on the 15th of this month. British and other consular officials, Shanghai British expats, and friends of Sir Philip will bid farewell at the Customs Pier at 12:10 p.m. on the same day. The British garrison in Shanghai will send a guard of honor to line up on the Bund to pay tribute.</p>
<h3>British Soldier Kills People, Sentenced to Hanging, But Will Apply for Pardon</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the British Court in China has been hearing the case of British soldier Ike Ford of the Xifu Zijiao Highland Team, who shot and killed Tai Davis, a soldier of the same team, at the intersection of Kaifeng Road and North Tibet Road on the night of November 4 last year, since the 9th of this month. The case was presided over by Prosecutor Sir Mo Su. Yesterday (the 11th) afternoon, the trial continued. The 12 jurors went to the scene of the incident to conduct an on-site investigation for about two hours before returning to the court. At about 7 p.m., Sir Mo Su pronounced the verdict in court based on the jurors' opinion, sentencing Ike Ford to death for murder, but the application for pardon should be submitted through normal channels. According to the records, Ike Ford is the second British person sentenced to hanging in Shanghai. In 1915, an Englishman named MacFarlane murdered his wife and was sentenced to hanging.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Issuing More Banknotes, Facts Prove to be Groundless, Speculators' Rumors Are Everyday, So the Exchange Market Has Never Been Affected</h3>
<p>After China's foreign trade improved and turned into a surplus, the foreign exchange fund became more and more consolidated, and the legal exchange rate has never fallen. The Shanghai black market foreign exchange has gradually stabilized, which is welcomed by merchants because the development of legitimate business should be based on a stable exchange market. However, speculators use the special environment of Shanghai to spread rumors and make profits. As a result, rumors in the market are like spring clouds that stretch and release from time to time. There is no day without them. For example, some parties rumored that the Chinese government would issue an additional 800 million yuan of banknotes, and then rumored that a large number of Chinese banknotes were printed in London. Facts have now proved that this is completely unfounded. The Chinese government has a great determination to stabilize the currency system, so the exchange market has not been affected by such rumors. If such a stable situation can be sustained, the general public will recognize the current exchange rate as a new level, and prices will be based on this as a basis for changes. All business plans will also take this as a starting point.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Ship Comes to Shanghai from Tianjin, Suddenly Searched by Customs, Suspected That the Ship is Secretly Hiding Opium or Drugs, Thorough Search Must Be Completed Today</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Norwegian ship Randi, weighing 1,800 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin with sheepskins and paper yesterday (the 11th) afternoon and berthed at the Roosevelt Pier on the Bund of the French Concession. After being inspected by customs officers, two</p>
<p>motorboats</p>
<p>of the "Municipal Police Bureau" suddenly drove to the side of the ship at midnight and sent 15 people on board. Seeing this, a customs officer immediately summoned the customs water police and ordered the "Municipal Police" to retreat. The customs personnel suspected that these people were not the "Municipal Police," so they dispatched 15 inspectors to board the ship this morning for a</p>
<p>thorough search</p>
<p>But as of this afternoon, nothing has been found. Captain Krestenson was not on the ship this morning, but according to a senior crew member of the ship, he had no prior knowledge. He was surprised to see the inspectors searching when he woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>quite surprised</p>
<p>He believes that the ship does not carry any prohibited items. However, customs officials strongly suspect that the ship is secretly hiding a large amount of opium or other drugs. According to a customs official, although they hope to complete the search today, they are afraid that it will take at least until tomorrow (the 13th) to complete it.</p>
<h3>Guowei Arts and Crafts Factory Obtains National Goods Certificate, Issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>The Victory brand various movable rubber stamps produced by the China Guowei Arts and Crafts Factory at No. 591, Lane 1, Xujiahui Road, have exquisite structures and excellent quality. They have long been popular everywhere and are unanimously recognized as high-quality domestic products. The factory has now received a national goods certificate issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government. A specially made reduced-size sample is attached to the various products sold for identification and to prevent deception by all parties.</p>
<h3>Medium-Sized Dredgers That Have Been Detained, No Intention of Returning, Difficult to Restore Huangpu River Completion</h3>
<p>Among the dredgers of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau that have been returned by the Japanese side, there are still only a few, such as the giant dredger Jianshe, which is only suitable for dredging outside the Wusong Estuary and is not suitable for Pei River work at all. In addition, the surveying ship Lilian, although it has also been returned, it has been assisting the Jianshe in surveying at the Wusong Estuary, so it is also not suitable for Pei River work.</p>
<p>Suitable Vessels Have Not Been Returned</p>
<p>It is found that the dredgers suitable for working in the Huangpu River are Haima, Haibao, Haili, Haiyi, and Haihu, and the surveying ships Liyong and Lijiang. However, the above-mentioned medium-sized vessels have been occupied by the Japanese side and are being used in the Yangshupu and Gaoqiao areas to facilitate their dredging and have no intention of returning them. Therefore, although the bureau has been forced to reorganize, it is still unable to resume the dredging project.</p>
<p>Staff Members are Anxious</p>
<p>As for all the staff members on the dredging and surveying vessels of the bureau, it is still difficult for them to board the ships to resume work. The situation is very anxious. However, the Japanese chief engineer Fujisawa has already arrived at the bureau. However, in reality, he also has a nominal title and there are no dredgers available for deployment, so he also feels very bored. In addition, the bureau's shipyard in Zhanghuabang has also not been returned by the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Case of Japanese Soldiers Beating European and American Women, No Reply Yet, US Consulate Makes Verbal Representations Requesting Prompt Handling</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that regarding the incident of American expatriate Ms. Donalson being beaten by a Japanese Navy sentry on December 20 last year, officials from the US Consulate made verbal representations to the Japanese Consulate authorities this morning (the 12th), requesting prompt handling. After the last negotiation by the US Consulate, the Japanese authorities have not replied for nearly ten days. After the incident, the Japanese side requested a more detailed report. The US Consulate prepared the details after the New Year holiday, and Ms. Donalson signed and submitted it to the Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3>Continued Operation of Price-Controlled Rice Sales, Rice Merchants Specially Make Six-and-a-Half-Catty Dou, Price-Controlled Rice Committee Holds Standing Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Price-Controlled Rice Sales Committee has purchased 16,000 bags of foreign rice from the Shanghai market and ordered 15,000 bags from Saigon, entrusting the Rice Merchants Association to handle the price-controlled sales.

All preparations have been completed and will be implemented on schedule. The rice merchants recruitment and address for the price-controlled sales will be officially announced by the association. In addition, after the Price-Controlled Rice Sales Committee solicited donations for price-controlled sales from all sectors, the amount recognized by various industries was 345,000 yuan, which has been notified to be paid directly to the receiving agency. The first standing committee meeting will be held at the Shipping Club at 3:00 pm today to discuss and handle price-controlled sales and other matters.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Circles to Promote Spring Festival Comfort Campaign: Saving Consumption and Shifting Gift-Giving Targets</h3>
<p>The National General Comfort Association, considering that the Lunar New Year is approaching and that there is much unnecessary waste in society at this time, which is not appropriate, is launching a nationwide Spring Festival Comfort Campaign on February 10th (the first day of the Lunar New Year). The aim is to save unnecessary consumption, shift the target of gift-giving, strengthen the war effort against Japan, and achieve final victory as soon as possible. All circles in Shanghai, sharing the same hatred of the enemy, will also uniformly promote this campaign, saving on Spring Festival gifts and other expenses to use for comfort purposes.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Transaction Statistics for the Last Nine Years: 1931 Was the Most Prosperous Year, Last Year's Transactions Exceeded 40 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Shanghai real estate is not only closely related to all residents and landlords in the city, but also closely linked to the entire financial market because it has been an important object for collateral and investment in the financial sector in the past. The year 1931 was the most prosperous, with the total number of transactions reaching 183,216,700 yuan in national currency. Later, due to the global economic downturn and the continuous outflow of Chinese capital, land prices plummeted, construction stagnated, vacancies increased, and rents decreased. Shanghai real estate was virtually ignored. Now, because inland capital is concentrated in Shanghai and previously escaped capital has soared, many investors are constantly buying in, and real estate is gradually recovering its prosperity.

<h3>Three Mail Carriers Dismissed for Failing to Deliver New Year's Mail on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, although the Shanghai Postal Administration was on holiday during the New Year, it continued to maintain the delivery of letters as usual. For example, on New Year's Day, a special shift was scheduled for the delivery of New Year's mail. This year, three mail carriers, using the holiday period as an excuse, failed to comply. Subsequently, the postal authorities summoned the three mail carriers for questioning, but they failed to comply with the summons. As a result, the post office dismissed the three mail carriers, and their uniforms have been returned to the bureau. Rumors that the three mail carriers were given demerits and reinstated are completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Falsely Accuses Chongqing: Concession Authorities State that the Japanese Spokesman's Remarks are Baseless</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, a senior official of the Public Concession stated yesterday (the 11th) that the allegation made by the Japanese spokesman at a press conference that the assassination attempt on Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, was carried out by people sent by Chongqing, is unfounded. It is reported that the three assailants have been arrested by the "Shanghai Municipal Police" and handed over to the Japanese Military Police. Therefore, the Japanese spokesman's remarks may be intended to divert public attention from the Japanese authorities' protection of the three assailants.</p>
<h3>Hoping Shop Owners Will Voluntarily Raise Salaries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Production Association, considering that the cost of living on the Isolated Island is becoming increasingly pressing, and that the general workers feel that their income cannot make ends meet, resulting in frequent strikes demanding wage increases, and at a time when the nation's major plans are at stake, labor and management in the rear should strive to produce and jointly understand the principle of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy, and vigorously implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and must not be indifferent and stir up labor strikes that hinder the administration of the Concession, causing pain to loved ones and joy to enemies. All companies should take into account the suffering of workers and appropriately increase wages. If labor strikes are allowed to drag on, not only will they affect the principle of labor-management production, but also, in this abnormal environment, it is feared that workers will be driven to be exploited, and there is a danger of going astray. The Association has sent letters to major manufacturers, hoping that they will follow the example of the China Book Company in voluntarily raising salaries, which would be a noble deed and beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood, and not only reduce labor strikes and assist the Concession authorities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Carrying White Rice Stopped at Wharf and Forcibly Detained: Negotiations on the Spot Proved Ineffective, Ship Taken to Waterfront Hotel</h3>
<p>The Japanese army is very cautious about the rice, cotton, and other grains entering the Concession. All boats sailing within the Peijiang River are inspected by the Nagaue Gendarmerie stationed at the Waterfront Hotel. If there are such goods on board without a purchasing certificate or pass, they will be detained, and there is a danger of the entire cargo being confiscated. In the past, such incidents have been countless. Yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m., a Japanese merchant vessel,</p>
<p>Taoyuan Foreign Company</p>
<p>G.F.H., a barge, loaded with more than 400 jars of shochu, hundreds of pigs, several bundles of firewood, and more than 20 crew members, each purchased more than 20 bags of white rice in Jiangbei. It arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday morning and, after waiting for the inspection to be completed, arrived in Shanghai in the afternoon and docked at Pier 13 on the Bund of Great Road. A Japanese waterfront gendarme and an interpreter came by small boat to inspect the barge and found white rice. They inquired about it, but the crew members hesitated to answer. The Japanese soldier</p>
<p>considered it to be private carrying</p>
<p>and wanted to tow the barge away. Just then, Chinese and Western personnel from the Public Concession Wharf Management Office arrived and negotiated with the Japanese gendarme for a long time to no avail. As a result, at 5:40 p.m., it was still towed to the Waterfront Hotel by a small boat and detained, and it is not known what will happen to it.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning to Shanghai from France Describe the Difficult Situation of Overseas Chinese: French Government Increases Income Tax, Actions Must Comply with Wartime Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, more than a thousand overseas Chinese have returned to China. The French postal ship Athos arrived in Shanghai from Europe the day before yesterday, carrying another 53 overseas Chinese, including Ye Gezhi, who lived in France and the Netherlands. They were all engaged in industry and commerce in Europe, and it is learned that more than 4,000 overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian and six students studying in France also returned to China on the same ship, disembarking first in Hong Kong and Haiphong.</p>
<p>Levying Wage Tax According to overseas Chinese returning to China, since the outbreak of the European War, at least 2,000 overseas Chinese in France and the Netherlands have been affected by the war and have lost their jobs. In addition to those who have successively returned to China, there are still a large number of overseas Chinese waiting for ships to return to China. At present, overseas Chinese merchants in France and the Netherlands who are engaged in small-scale sales have closed down, and only a portion of overseas Chinese who have opened shops and work in large factories remain. However, due to economic difficulties, wages in various factories have gradually decreased. At present, the wages earned are only one-third of those before the war. The French government has recently increased the wartime income tax by one-fifth for each person, so the wages received are very meager. Most Chinese workers are unable to maintain their livelihoods and have resigned one after another.</p>
<p>Shortening Night Market As for the recent situation of the European War, the preparations for war in various countries have become more active. The French government has strict control over foreigners. When walking on the streets during the day, they must comply with the wartime regulations of the French government and carry gas masks. Otherwise, they are prohibited from walking. Foreigners without special passes are not allowed to pass at night, otherwise they will be detained. Therefore, the night business hours of overseas Chinese shops have automatically gradually shortened.</p>
<h3>New Drugs Not Registered Are Not Allowed to Be Sold: Those with Such Inventory Must Report to the Association Within a Limited Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, due to the recent proliferation of new drugs on the market, some of the raw materials used do not conform to the ingredients stipulated in the pharmacopoeia, which not only hinders legitimate business but also damages the credibility of new drugs. Therefore, on December 13 of last year, a joint meeting of the executive supervisors and consultants of the two associations was convened to discuss methods of banning. It was unanimously agreed that the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association had already established rules for product registration and review. Whether members or non-members, if they wish to sell their new products, they should first register with the association and, after passing the review, the association will notify the members before they can be sold. It was resolved to notify the members that new products not registered with the New Pharmaceutical Association will not be allowed to be sold in the future. If there is such inventory, and it is not clear whether it has been registered with the association, please list the names and inquire with the association within fifteen days of receiving this letter so that we can reply. Otherwise, if it is found out later, it will be dealt with in accordance with the rules. It is appropriate to record the case and inform you, and it is hoped that you will comply with this resolution."</p>
<h3>Arsenolite and Realgar Prohibited from Export</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the main component of arsenolite is arsenic trioxide, which contains a lot of arsenic and can be used as an important raw material for manufacturing sneeze-inducing toxic gases such as Lewisite, so it should be prohibited from export. In addition to telegraphed Resources Commission to stop issuing export permits for arsenolite and realgar, it is specially telegraphed for information.</p>
<h3>Overview of Important Administrative Matters of the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1939</h3>
<p>During the year, the process of urban recovery progressed very slowly and was constrained by various difficulties. However, the great capacity of all sectors of society to overcome all kinds of hardships was able to manifest itself again. Commercial conditions have been chaotic since the Sino-Japanese War. Last year, the outbreak of the European War and the depreciation of the national currency made the situation even more unstable. Several new problems arose in the city last year, the most prominent of which were (1) the handling of a large number of Jewish refugees from Central Europe, (2) the negotiations on police powers in the area of roads outside the western boundary of Shanghai in the second half of the year, and (3) the extremely serious situation when the national currency fell to three and a half pennies.</p>
<p>Negotiations for the Return of the Area North of the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>Negotiations for the return of the area north of the Suzhou Creek to the full management of the Council have not been successful. However, with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, the Council has expanded its power to issue various licenses in the area. Chinese people who want to go to the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts must hold passes. These passes are still checked by Japanese sentries stationed there, but the restrictions on the transportation of goods have been relaxed.</p>
<p>More Than 30,000 Refugees in the Concession</p>
<p>In addition to carrying out normal affairs, the departments of the Council in the areas south of the Suzhou Creek had to handle a number of heavy tasks. At the end of the year, there were 28 refugee shelters for Chinese refugees in the Concession, accommodating about 33,000 refugees. The Council managed and cared for these shelters and tried to continue to merge them to make the management more strict. In the area outside the western boundary of Shanghai, which was originally a residential area, factories and houses have been built in recent years. However,</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Issue of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Chinese police suddenly dispatched by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government were stationed at several of the most important roads and intersections in the area outside the western boundary of Shanghai and directed traffic, which caused a serious situation. All of these roads were built by the Council, and the police powers have always been exercised by the Police Department of the Council. The Council has borne a huge amount of expenditure for the development of the western corner of Shanghai. After the above-mentioned incident occurred, the Council immediately protested. At that time, several serious incidents occurred, and police officers on both sides died. The Council has begun negotiations with Mayor Chuan Xiao'an and exchanged views on the case in mid-November. By the end of the year, no solution had been reached, and the dangerous situation of police officers from both sides standing guard and exercising police powers in the area has not changed.</p>
<p>Limiting Rice Prices and Cracking Down on Hoarding</p>
<p>The Council has paid close attention to the supply of food and fuel in the Concession, allowing rice and coal to be prioritized. In the summer of last year, when rice prices were rising, the authorities of the two concessions jointly issued a notice restricting rice prices. In August, the price of white rice once rose to 50 yuan per stone, far exceeding the price limit. Some rice shops stopped business because they could not import goods, and it was not uncommon to sell adulterated rice. Later, due to good harvests in rice-producing areas, rice prices gradually fell, but in December, they rose again. Therefore, the authorities of the two concessions jointly issued a notice again, giving a serious warning to general hoarders and speculators.</p>
<p>Electricity and Gas Prices Increased Separately</p>
<p>Regarding coal, there was a shortage of inventory in the Far East, and it was necessary to order it from abroad, so coal prices rose sharply. The Council's Fuel Committee paid close attention to this at all times. As coal prices rose, the most difficult companies were the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Gas Company. Therefore, they successively obtained the approval of the Council to levy surcharges separately to make up for the huge operating expenses.</p>
<p>Handling Jewish Refugees</p>
<p>Near the end of the year before last, a large number of Jewish refugees began to come to Shanghai from Central Europe. By last year, the number of people had increased sharply, and the situation began to become serious. Most of the refugees were placed in shelters in the area north of the Suzhou Creek. This placement work was the responsibility of several committees and groups, and the Council also provided assistance, lending some of its properties in the eastern district for accommodation. Later, as refugees continued to arrive, the situation became more and more serious. The Council then requested the consular corps to telegraph their respective governments, stating the plight of the city and the inability of refugees to find jobs, asking them to find ways to prevent them from coming to Shanghai. However, it was ineffective. By April, the total number of refugees exceeded 6,000. In May, scarlet fever was discovered in the shelters. Fortunately, it was handled properly and did not spread. In June, the total number of refugees reached about 10,000. In August, it increased to about 15,000. Therefore, the Japanese authorities announced a temporary ban on refugees coming to Shanghai. At the same time, the Council also decided to prohibit European refugees from continuing to enter the country and sent separate letters to the consular corps and various shipping companies for verification. In October, the Council and the Japanese authorities agreed to promulgate a rule allowing these refugees to live in the area south of the Suzhou Creek after arriving in Shanghai. As of the end of the year, about 300 permits had been issued under this rule.</p>
<p>Striving to Prevent Water Accumulation on Roads</p>
<p>Last year, many parts of the area south of the Suzhou Creek were often flooded, causing inconvenience. The Council published a statement in November explaining the cause of the flooding. It was found that water accumulation on the roads was due to high tides and excessive rainfall. To prevent high tides, the Works Department of the Council installed valves at the mouths of the drains in the flooded area to prevent backflow of river water. A seawall was built along the Bund, and a pump was installed to drain the drain water when the drain openings were blocked. These measures have been effective. Last year's excessive rainfall caused the flooded area to expand and last longer. The reasons were (1) the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek have not been dredged for a long time since August 1937, (2) the city's ground is sinking year by year, (3) industry in the western district outside the boundary of Shanghai has suddenly developed and is not controlled by the Council, and (4) the drain outlets of the French Concession at the junction of Avenue Foch and the Public Concession are not easy to maintain perfectly. The Director of the Works Department of the Council reported to the Board of Directors that if the flooding situation is to be completely improved, it is estimated that about 800,000 yuan in national currency will be required. At that time, the Council did not undertake the project because of insufficient financial resources, but decided to take various reasonable measures as much as possible in 1940. If there is not too much rain this year, the above-mentioned situation can be greatly improved. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yong'an Company Employee Arrested and Released After Reprimand Yesterday</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road had demanded improved treatment and increased salaries from the company authorities due to the high cost of goods, which had once led to a strike. The matter was resolved through negotiations between labor and management. However, on December 31 of last year, the company authorities suddenly issued an order to dismiss 31 employees, which caused dissatisfaction among all employees. The situation was very serious for a time. The Laozha Police Station received a report and sent several Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the situation and arrested three employees: Liang Tongxin and Cai Titao from Ningbo, and Wu Renjie from Wuxi. They were escorted to the First Special Court and requested to be detained. Yesterday morning, Liang and others were escorted by the police station to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Chinese Police Station formally filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 150 and 153, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and recounted the situation at the time. The defendants also hired lawyers to appear in court on their behalf, requesting the judge to clearly investigate the interrogation and issue a verdict in court. The judge sentenced Liang, Cai, and Wu to a fine of ten yuan each. If they were unable to pay the fine, they were allowed to offset it at the rate of two yuan per day. However, it was found that Liang and others had been detained on the first day of this month, and according to the detention date, they had already exceeded the amount of the fine, so they were released in court.</p>
<h3>Fire in Shacks on Singapore Road: More Than 500 Burned Down</h3>
<p>Hundreds of shacks of ordinary people on Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai suddenly caught fire yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m. The flames were soaring, and the fire was extremely fierce. Residents fled in all directions upon hearing the alarm. Later, the fire brigade drove to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. It took about three hours for the fire to be extinguished. It is estimated that more than 500 shacks were burned down. Whether anyone was buried in the fire is currently being investigated by the fire brigade in the rubble.</p>
<h3>Another Suspect Arrested in Coal Fraud Case: Awaiting Joint Trial</h3>
<p>Lu Yili, a peddler from Changzhou at No. 33 Sichuan Road, Huacheng Coal Company, falsely claimed to the manager, Wu Tieqi from Guangdong, on March 4 of last year that the Da Zhonghua Shoe Factory needed 500 tons of Hongji coal dust. Since the company had no goods to sell, it was learned that the Yuancheng Coal Company at No. 106 Gansidong Road had goods on the market. It could purchase 200 tons from them and resell them to Da Zhonghua to obtain a huge profit. Wu believed him and prepared 6,680 yuan the next day. He sent Lu and his assistants, Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen, to the Yuancheng Coal Company with the money. After paying, they presented a forged stock receipt of the Tongchang Coal Company as an excuse. When the case was discovered, Lu absconded with the money. Wu reported the case to the French Police Station, and Chen Kangyuan (from Ningbo), a peddler from the Yuancheng Coal Company, was first arrested and sent to the court, which sentenced him to six months in prison. Lu was wanted by the court in the summer. After nine months, Lu Yili was arrested on the day before yesterday and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The case was recorded in yesterday's newspaper after interrogation and detention for investigation and then interrogation. It is now learned that during the investigation, Lu's brother, Lu Shouxiang, used 3,000 yuan of the money defrauded by Lu, Chen Kangyuan used 1,000 yuan, and the remainder was spent by Lu himself. Therefore, Chen Kangyuan (who was previously sentenced to six months' probation) was arrested by the detectives, but he had already escaped. Only Lu Shouxiang was arrested and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court yesterday, requesting detention and joint investigation with Lu Yili, and then requesting interrogation after the investigation. After questioning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, the defendant was ordered to be detained and await a joint trial with Lu Yili on the 18th.</p>

Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi appeared in court for a continued trial. Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Police Station stated that during the adjournment, it was investigated that the defendants Xu Chenggui and Zhang Tianhua, together with Ge Jinbiao, who was at large, used weapons to rob Zhai Asan, who was leaving the Qianhe Paint Shop at No. 138 Tonglu, No. 444 Jiangxi Road, at 11:10 a.m. on November 8 of last year. Zhai Asan was going to take 1,000 yuan from the post office on North Suzhou Road back to the shop. While passing through the lane, Zhang Tianhua shot and injured Zhai's head, killing him on the spot. The robbers escaped with the money and each received 300 yuan. The pistol belonged to Xu Chenggui, who received 100 yuan more. The suspects Zhou Xirong, Zhang Zhongliang, and He Binghai were found to be unrelated and were requested to be released in advance. The court approved it. The remaining nine people, including Zhou Changlin and Xu Chenshi, were adjourned for further investigation of other cases. Judge Jiang interrogated Xu and Zhang separately and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification.</p>

<h3>Appeal in Rape of Dancer Case Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cao Zheng, the son of Cao Yongxiang, the owner of the Cao Xiangtai Foreign Goods Store at No. 276 Avenue Edward VII, had a close relationship with Qian Xiuying (17 years old), a dancer at the Da Mei Dance Hall, last summer. They went to the World Hotel on Avenue Edward VII and secretly made a lifelong commitment. After several romantic encounters, Xiuying became pregnant. However, Cao Zheng's family opposed his marriage to a dancer, which thwarted their marriage plans. Subsequently, Qian Shaoqing, Qian's father, filed a complaint with the Second Special Court on behalf of Xiuying, accusing Cao Zheng of hindering the family, etc. Cao Zheng also admitted the charges. Judge Zhang sentenced Cao Zheng to one year and six months in prison for hindering the family. Cao refused to accept the sentence and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Daqi, accompanied by Judges Wang and Wu, opened the Third Criminal Division for trial. In order to shirk responsibility, Cao Zheng completely overturned his original confession and denied that he intended to marry Qian Xiuying as his wife, only admitting that he had had several physical relations with Qian. After verifying the confessions in court and questioning Qian Xiuying in detail, he ordered the debate in the case to be concluded and set the sentencing for the 19th.</p>
<h3>Foreman Suspected of Stealing Gold Bars Arrested</h3>

The court briefly questioned Liu and ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Infant Suffocates to Death While Sleeping with Maid: Maid Wang Zhushi Detained Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Wang Zhushi (26 years old), a woman from Suzhou, came to Shanghai from her hometown in October of last year and worked as a maid in the home of Peng Wu'huang, a man from Jiangxi, at No. 51, Lane 375, Xiaoshadu Road. She did housework such as cooking and laundry during the day, and slept with Peng's 18-month-old daughter, Meimei, at night. Around 1 a.m. on the 11th, Wang Zhushi accidentally</p>
<p>pressed her mouth and nose</p>
<p>suffocating her to death. She only realized it at dawn when Meimei was already dead, with blood flowing from her mouth and nose. In a panic, she wiped away the blood with a towel and reported to Peng's wife, Tu, that Meimei was ill and dying. Peng Wu'huang and his wife rushed to see their daughter and found blood stains on the bed, quilt, and mattress. They interrogated Wang, but she was evasive. They sent the girl to the Red Cross Hospital, but she died without being resuscitated. After the doctor determined that Meimei had</p>
<p>died of suffocation,</p>
<p>the body was sent to the mortuary. At the same time, the Gordon Road Police Station was notified, and detectives were sent to the address to take the maid Wang Zhushi to the police station.

Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be remanded in custody pending further examination of Meimei's body.</p>
<h3>New Official Abandons Wife; Former Wife Sues for Alimony</h3>
<p>Luo Canhua, a woman from Zhenjiang, is 31 years old. Years ago, she was married to Zhang Zhengzhi, a fellow villager, by arrangement of her parents. They have been married for seven years and have a daughter who is now four years old. They used to live together in Suzhou, but fled to Shanghai due to the war two years ago. Zhang was working in education, so their circumstances were generally average, but their marital love was constant. Unexpectedly, Zhang recently became an important official in a puppet organization through sycophancy. Money became very easy to come by, and his personal life suddenly changed. He indulged in prostitution almost every night. Soon, he met a woman in the pleasure quarter and treated her like a precious jewel. He engaged in cohabitation, neglecting his wife of many years and cutting off her financial support. For the past six months, Luo has been living entirely on loans. Recently, she felt unable to continue and filed a lawsuit against her husband in the First Special Court, requesting alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu summoned them for questioning, but because the defendant's address listed in the plaintiff's complaint was incorrect, the summons could not be delivered. After Luo corrected the address in court yesterday, the court ordered another summons to be issued.</p>

<h3>Village Girl Escapes Prostitution Den</h3>
<p>Tan Suzhen, also known as Jin Di, a sixteen-year-old girl from Suzhou, was lured to Shanghai last September by her aunt, Shen Qian, on the pretext of introducing her to a job as a maid. She was sold to Di Chunsheng, a Changzhou native who ran a brothel at No. 2, Old Guild Hall Lane, Sanma Road, for a price. After entering the brothel, Di forced her to solicit customers at amusement parks. If she disobeyed, she would be beaten and closely monitored. It was not until the day before yesterday that she managed to escape and went to her brother, Tan Shuiquan, who accompanied her to the Zhabei Police Station to request assistance.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers to Renew Licenses and Register on Schedule From the 22nd of This Month to the 4th of April</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has scheduled the renewal of licenses and general registration for public rickshaw pullers from the 22nd of this month to the 4th of April. Starting yesterday, the Rickshaw Guild was specially commissioned to distribute registration application forms (four forms per rickshaw, totaling 38,000 forms for 9,500 rickshaws). Rickshaw owners or leaseholders are responsible for introducing rickshaw pullers to register at the Rickshaw Pullers Licensing Office during the specified period. If the number of rickshaw pullers is still less than 38,000 by April 4th, new rickshaw pullers will be openly recruited. At the same time, rickshaw owners are strictly prohibited from exploiting rickshaw pullers and should introduce as many rickshaw pullers as possible who can pull at least 15 shifts per month.</p>
<h3>Two Gunmen Stop a Car</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Avenue du Président Doumer and Rue du Consulat at around 6:55 PM yesterday, a car with a black license plate No. 3639 issued by the concession was suddenly stopped by two gunmen who jumped out from the roadside as it passed by. They opened the car door, jumped in, and ordered the driver to drive towards Avenue Foch. The driver had no choice but to drive east on Avenue Foch. Near the intersection of Hart Road, the two men ordered the car to stop, jumped out together, and headed towards Hart Road. The car was then free to go. Fearing involvement, the driver reported the incident to the police for record.</p>
<h3>The Forger of the Invitation is Kennett Wilson</h3>
<p>The "Millard's Review" reported that the person who issued invitations to local newspapers such as the "North China Daily News" and the "China Press" in the name of the "Reformed Government" Commissioner for the Recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, Hong Kong, Kowloon, etc., inviting them to attend a banquet at the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong for the "Sino-British Signing of the Treaty for the Recovery of Hong Kong," was Kennett Wilson, who was once a British lawyer in Shanghai. He later changed his profession to journalism and is now the editor of a publication called "Voice of New China."</p>
<h3>Trolleybuses to be Fitted with Rubber Tires; Seven Still Difficult to Convert; Allowed to Continue Use Until Year-End</h3>
<p>In 1935, the Municipal Council agreed with the Shanghai Electric Construction Company that, starting from January 1, 1936, all trolleybuses owned by the company would receive a reduction in mileage fees paid to the Council once they were fitted with rubber tires. However, the company was required to complete the conversion of all iron-wheeled trolleybuses by January 1, 1939, at the latest. Due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War, the company's factories were shut down, making it impossible to complete the conversion on time. In 1938, the Council granted an extension until January 1 of this year. However, the company was still required to convert the remaining 25 iron-wheeled trolleybuses as soon as possible before the end of 1938. According to the company, all trolleybuses except for seven that were difficult to convert had been converted within the time limit.

<h3>City Federation Appeals to Landlords Not to Increase Rent; Times of High Prices and Difficult Livelihoods; If Rent is Increased Again, It Will Affect Public Security and Order</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that prices in Shanghai are expensive after the war and people's livelihood is difficult. On September 12 last year, it jointly sent a letter with various public organizations to the courts, asking them to pay special attention to landlords increasing rents on various pretexts in order to relieve the people's hardship. Recently, the Federation has received repeated reports of rent increases in Hongrui Lane, Xinza Road, and Hongfu Lane, North Henan Road. They believe that in this extraordinary period, prices are expensive and people are struggling to survive. If rents are increased again, it will greatly affect the market and public security and order. Poor citizens will find it even more difficult to survive. They especially appeal to landlords to be considerate of the difficult times and not to exploit their tenants like boiling beans in a pod. Stop increasing rents for tenants.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Sir, According to the statement made by the involved party, Li Xu Jiaodi, after reading the news item "Young Woman Suddenly Changes Her Mind and Leaves Her Husband" in the Shanghai Shenbao on the 12th of this month, she was extremely surprised. Upon investigation, she and Li Rende have been married for a long time, and have two sons and one daughter. In the beginning, they were still at peace, but later, her husband had an affair and suddenly treated her coldly, gradually resorting to beatings. He even openly took his mistress to room 117 of the Tianjin Ning Business Hotel for a secret rendezvous, where she caught them red-handed. On November 11 of the same year, he beat her with a stick for no reason, causing her to suffer injuries all over her body. Her father-in-law and aunt-in-law also aided and abetted him, which is heartbreaking to speak of. She reported the matter to the French Police and filed a public lawsuit, in which the main text of the judgment stated, "Li Rende is sentenced to 20 days of detention for causing bodily harm, with a two-year suspended sentence" (Case No. 3200, Jie Yi in the 28th year). She has suffered countless abuses and beatings, making it impossible to continue living together. Therefore, on November 13 of last year, she took her children and left in distress, temporarily staying at her mother's house. On the 15th of the same month, she entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to her husband, stating her unavoidable circumstances. Now, the Shenbao's headline for this case is "Young Woman Suddenly Changes Her Mind and Leaves Her Husband," and it is stated that "Jiaodi often leaves and wanders around, and Li has repeatedly tried to persuade her, but she not only refuses to listen, but becomes angry out of shame." These statements are not only far from the truth, but also damage her reputation. As for entrusting lawyer Zhou Liangfu to send a letter requesting 5,400 yuan in alimony, she does not know where this letter came from. In addition to entrusting lawyer Zhou to investigate thoroughly, please send a letter to the Shenbao to make a correction in order to set the record straight. I hereby send this letter on behalf of her, hoping that you will grant a correction. Yours sincerely, Zhou Liangfu, Lawyer, January 12.</p>

<h3>A Journey of the Mind</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>While talking with a young friend about the joy of traveling and the importance of seeing the world, this friend told me a shocking fact. He said that many of his friends who grew up in Shanghai had never been on a ship, never taken a train, and never left Shanghai in their twenty-odd years of life.</p>
<p>It seems a bit absurd and unbelievable, but I believe him. I know it's true because in most Chinese families, going out for no reason is an exception, and a rare one at that.</p>
<p>Living in a civilized society with such convenient transportation, we have a vast world to explore, which can expand our knowledge of life. Yet, we prefer to be like frogs in a well, living in a small corner.</p>
<p>I sigh.</p>
<p>I not only sigh at the narrow scope of Chinese people's lives, and their lack of understanding of the importance of travel, but I also sigh at their failure to take advantage of the opportunities for intellectual journeys.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? What is a journey of the mind?</p>
<p>There are plenty of books in bookstores and newspapers and magazines on newsstands. Books, newspapers, and magazines are the tools for our intellectual journeys, the spiritual trains, ships, and planes. Books are not just filled with gold houses or beautiful women; they are filled with ideas, science, life, society, the principles of living, knowledge about the world, and the vast, boundless world.</p>
<p>Reading a book is like taking a long intellectual trip; reading a newspaper or a magazine allows you to travel to far-off corners of the world in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>We must not only understand the meaning of travel but also understand the importance of intellectual journeys.</p>
<p>Travelers in this world, let us be generous and spend some time every day on intellectual journeys!</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Doing</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Wen</p>
<p>We are born into this world for love, for some illusory and ethereal love. We love birds, flowers, mountains, water, the earth, and everything else. In fact, we are loved by them as well.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, we have been seeking happiness in love and enduring pain in love. This happiness makes us forget all the sorrows of the past, and this pain encourages us to move forward. No difficulty can stop our ambition. No matter how much social pressure or environmental coercion there is, we only know to move forward, to move forward, straight to the bright lighthouse.</p>
<p>During this time, we have met many friends and seen many faces clearly. This one is cannibalistic, that one is deceitful, this one is hypocritical, and that one is seductive. However, we have not been eaten, nor have we been deceived. Similarly, hypocrisy can only deceive itself, and seduction can only mislead itself. We will not be fooled.</p>
<p>Today, as we recall the joy of more than a decade ago and the struggles in between, we cannot help but shed tears. The houses we saw when we were young are now old, the roads we were familiar with when we were young have now changed, and the friends and classmates we knew when we were young are now parents. The wheel of time is moving so fast!</p>
<p>We have many friends, which is the greatest meaning and comfort of our existence in this world. Some friends help us with our lives, some friends point us to the future, and even more friends are willing to sacrifice themselves to solve our difficulties and bring us happiness. We don't know how to thank them enough. We know that this is the love of mankind, the most divine and sacred love in the world, and we can only repay them with this love.</p>
<p>We remember responsibility, the responsibility of being human. What is the responsibility of being human? It is to dedicate one's love, to express one's strength, and to give everything to society. We do beneficial work in society, and we should not care about some costs or rewards. We must know that work that is bound by costs and rewards is not real work, but a deceptive facade. We are not deceivers, we are still two young children with pure thoughts.</p>

<h3>Gandhi and Nehru</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>Gandhi and Nehru are two revolutionary leaders of India. Gandhi has long been known worldwide, and Nehru visited our country only last year, so everyone is also familiar with him. These two have different views on life and different temperaments, yet they have a strong spiritual connection. It is rare in the world for two leaders to cooperate so well.</p>
<p>It is interesting to talk about the contrast between their two personalities. Gandhi is a devout religious man, while Nehru does not believe in ghosts or gods. He advocates the separation of politics and religion. Gandhi's ideal India is a simple rural society. Nehru, on the other hand, has been influenced by new ideas and wants to transform India into an industrialized urban society. Gandhi firmly believes in non-violent resistance, while Nehru thinks this is just a temporary measure. Gandhi opposes any drastic reforms in society and economy. He believes that the most important thing is for everyone to cleanse their hearts and seek spiritual purity, and society can be improved through the cooperation of all classes. But Nehru doubts these things. He says that if the material environment does not change, how easy is it to transform one's conscience? From this point of view, Gandhi's ideal seems more abstract, while Nehru is much clearer about his plans.</p>
<p>However, Gandhi is by no means a reactionary. He is the most special revolutionary of all time. His methods are too strange. Not to mention Westerners don't understand him, even his old comrades think he is a "mystery." He has a unique spiritual power, and the souls of 300 million Indians seem to be influenced by him at all times. In addition, his courage, his austere life, and his indomitable spirit are rare in the world. Therefore, despite Nehru's ideological differences with Gandhi, in fact, Nehru simply worships Gandhi.</p>
<p>Nehru never directly calls him "Gandhi." He always calls him "Grandpa" (Bapu) or "Gandhi Grandpa" (Gandhiji). Whenever he has any doubts, he always consults Gandhi. He strongly praises Gandhi's opinions and considers his own ideas to be less important. Sometimes, the progressive youth of India criticize Gandhi for being too backward. Gandhi himself does not defend himself, but Nehru will loudly refute their misconceptions. The Indian poet Tagore once said, "Except for Gandhi, no one else feels that the Indians are his own flesh and blood." Nehru agrees with this statement very much.</p>
<p>Gandhi and Nehru both came from wealthy families, but later they were both willing to give up their comfortable lives and dedicate themselves to the oppressed people. They both sacrificed everything to engage in the Indian national liberation movement. Their goals are the same, their missions are the same, and in addition, they have a teacher-student relationship, so how can they not cooperate? Gandhi put it best: "Nehru and I both feel that neither of us can do without the other. There is a spiritual connection between us that no intellectual difference can destroy."</p>
<p>We have faith, and this faith makes us stand firm in the world and never fall. We are like a ship sailing in fierce waves. One big wave hits us, we are not afraid. Two big waves hit us, we are not afraid. Three big waves hit us, we are even less afraid! Why? Because we have goals, we have faith. Our spirit is brave, our will is firm. If we fail, we must work hard. If we succeed, we must work even harder. We know very well that this is not being cattle or horses, but serving the public and seeking happiness. We are about to reach the shore, let our friends join hands.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Playing Deaf and Dumb</h3>
<p>— Hong Fei</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Second European War, one day, King George of England stopped to watch the workers polishing the inside of shells while inspecting an arms factory. The sound of friction when polishing the shells was very loud, which can be described as deafening. Therefore, ordinary workers could not undertake this work, and the factory hired deaf and mute workers. King George leaned his head in to watch those "robot-like figures" working through a small glass window.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, whether they are geniuses or disabled, they can all do their best in the cause of war now. Using deaf and dumb workers to polish shells is like using canaries in cages to test for poisonous gases. However, in democratic countries, we have the right to say this: Only in times of war emergency do we recruit deaf and dumb people to take on the duties of robots. But in the culture of modern totalitarianism, human life is completely immersed in a robotic state. Whether in times of peace or war, the oppressed people are practically deaf and dumb. They can only hear what their masters want them to hear, and they are only allowed to say what their masters tell them to say.</p>
<p>It is perhaps the distinction between totalitarian and democratic countries that the people of totalitarian countries have to live their lives blindly by playing deaf and dumb.</p>
<h3>Talking in Patches</h3>

<p>The British most popular humor magazine, Punch, speaks wittily and meaningfully. Once, a writer asked, "Why can't the countries of Europe live together like a big family?" Punch's answer is: Europe is bad because it is just like most big families.</p>
<p>There are Finns in Shanghai who are raising funds to aid Finland, and after donating, they call the people of Shanghai "the real League of Nations." I don't know if it's praise or scolding.</p>

<h3>Franco's Film Policy</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The Spanish dictator Franco has recently attempted to eliminate the influence of foreign films in his country, and has adopted a clever approach.</p>
<p>He does not follow other countries' methods of prohibiting the import of films, but stipulates that for every ten films that a foreign film company wants to show in Spain, one film must be shot in Spain. At first glance, it does not seem like anything new, but American filmmakers are greatly alarmed and are demanding that the government intervene.</p>
<p>It turns out that Franco's film policy includes two secrets: "promoting culture" and "obtaining foreign exchange." Since foreign films are shot within Spain, all backgrounds and consciousness will naturally be based on being pro-Spanish. When these films are transported to Central America, many Spanish-speaking people living there will undoubtedly watch the Spain under Franco's rule, and make a mandatory publicity for him. This is the main point.</p>
<p>In addition, when each film is made and released in Spain, the Spanish government and foreign filmmakers will split the profits equally. If the film is transported outside of Spain, a deposit must first be paid to the Spanish authorities before it is allowed to leave. At the same time, the money earned from screenings abroad must be converted into foreign exchange and split with the Spanish government.</p>
<p>In this way, only the Spanish government benefits. Many expenses of foreign filmmakers will take a very long time to recoup, and sometimes they suffer heavy losses, which is equivalent to making all the revenue from one of every ten films shown in Spain as a donation to Franco. Of course, foreign filmmakers are free to withdraw from the Spanish market, but in this way, Franco's purpose of excluding foreign films will be fully achieved.</p>
<h3>Xin Yanqiu Arrives Safe and Sound, Yu Zhenfei's Charm Remains</h3>
<p>— Biyu</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu, originally named Wang Yuhua, is a famous female performer who rose to prominence after Ji Zhang'eyun. Her art is entirely based on that of Cheng Yushuang, and she has gained a great deal of understanding. She is one of the most like-minded learners of Cheng in the female troupe, and her appearance and acting are also very similar to Yushuang. Xin's learning of Cheng must have taken considerable effort. Several years ago, she followed Yang Xiaolou and Ma Lianliang to the south, and was greatly appreciated by the people of Jiangnan. Three years ago, when a certain celebrity celebrated his sixtieth birthday, Xin came from afar to offer congratulations and performed plays such as "Wuhua Cave" and "Visiting Mother". Her skills had indeed improved a lot compared to her previous visits to the south. In the same year, she performed in Baixia, and Cheng Yushuang also performed in the capital, so Xin competed directly with Cheng, which enhanced their common reputation. After returning to the north, her reputation increased day by day, and she had the potential to dominate the female performers in Beijing. Last year, Xin was imprisoned in Beijing for a certain incident, and it was rumored in Shanghai that Xin Lingyu had died in prison. It was later confirmed that this statement was incorrect, and Xin had sold her former residence in the capital and moved her family to Tianjin, intending to live there permanently and no longer perform on stage. Therefore, although Xin is in the north, she has not performed for a long time. This time, Shi Xin invited Du Juchu to perform, and Xin agreed to come south after repeated consultations, because she could not refuse out of friendship. The reporter once met Xin during her trip, and her behavior and conversation were as usual. Fortunately, Xin Yanqiu arrived safely, and the people of Shanghai are fortunate to hear Xin's song again in this year of war and chaos.</p>
<p>The young male actor who came with Xin is Yu Zhenfei, an old partner of Cheng Yushuang. Zhenfei was born in Jiangnan and was originally a famous amateur performer in the south. He was persuaded to become a professional actor by Yushuang. Zhenfei once joined the school of veteran actor Cheng Jixian, and was Cheng's proud disciple along with Ye Sheng. Since parting ways with Yushuang, he has not performed for a long time. This time, he came with Xin Yanqiu. Since Xin's acting style is based on Cheng's, Zhenfei's performance will be easy and appropriate, and it is expected to have the effect of green leaves setting off the peony. Zhenfei has been living at home in Beijing in recent years, and has spared no effort in studying Kunqu Opera. Hongdou Guanzhu, a famous Kunqu Opera artist in Beijing, has praised him greatly. Kunqu Opera in Shanghai has now become a situation of high art and few followers, but there are still many people who are proficient in this art. This time Zhenfei came to the south, which is good news for those who appreciate Kunqu Opera.</p>
<p>News from the opera circle: The "China Drama Research Association," a joint organization of small theater groups, recently published the "Drama Series." The first collection, "Wen Tianxiang," was created by the famous director Kong Linxua, and has recently been published. The content depicts the national hero "Wen Tianxiang," whose loyalty and righteousness are magnificent, and is considered to be a profound "regret of the late Ming Dynasty." It is said that the play was first performed by the "Fudan Drama Troupe" and was well received. The second collection, "Xiao Wuyi," was collectively created by members of the association's drama group and will be published soon.</p>
<h3>Tan-Style Veteran Actor Zhang Wenjuan About to Leave Shanghai for Beijing</h3>
<p>— Mu Yilong (photographer)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Outside the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Mu Huo</p>
<p>Handsome man Li Xiangyun and Zang Languang</p>
<p>After Huifang and Kunsheng broke away from the joint theater group due to disagreements, they once cooperated with Xiangyun, formed their own troupe, and performed in Tianjin and Beijing several times. They hoped that someone from Shanghai could take over, so they could issue black tickets (black tickets mean that they hoped that someone from Shanghai could take over, so they could issue black tickets (black tickets mean that famous amateur performers secretly receive a bonus) and officially become actors.</p>
<p>However, because he was unwilling to put in the hard work, he did not have enough plays to teach, so Jiang Lao's thick intentions of support were wasted, and there were no achievements. He also never had the opportunity to show his face in the south. Now, Li's golden age has passed, and the trees on his benefactor's grave have grown thick. Even if he wants to work hard and make progress, it is too late. He has no economic support, and it is very difficult to form a troupe in Beijing, let alone perform in other places. After the four famous dan, no one has taken over the male actors. Xiangyun originally had very good material for acting, and also had strong support, but unfortunately he did not improve himself, thinking that with Jiang Lao, he would not have to worry about economic problems. He showed his talent ten years ago, but he was not as popular as Zhang Junqiu, who became famous later, and was highly praised by the society. It can be seen that most of the actors who enjoy great fame come from hardship and poverty. When they are about to become famous or have not yet become famous, having a patron will hinder the development of their studies. New actors who have just enjoyed great fame should take this as a warning. Zang Languang's situation is similar to Xiangyun's. She studied acting with Huifang for a short time, and she did not practice hard in private. She is young and beautiful, busy with social activities, and very fond of dressing up. Although she occasionally performed once in three or five months in Beijing, they were all temporary troupes, only performing her few signature plays. (172)</p>
