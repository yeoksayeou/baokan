<h3 id="c10">遠東與歐洲 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>今日世界的重心是歐洲還是東方，這目然不是片言可決的問題。單從經濟和商業觀點來看：到此度大戰前夜爲止，夙由歐洲綰握着無上權威，因之也就不失其領導地位；但如果涉及全世界的政治命運，則半世紀以至一世紀以前的那種歐洲支配世界的見解，顯已變成陳舊；至低限度，國際間所進行着的許多變動，已不是單由歐洲方面的力量所能決定。解決第一次大戰戰後局面的凡爾賽會議，對於遠東只產生了一些拙劣而不切實際的議案；一九三一年九月間開始的遠東風雲、則更形成此度歐洲大戰的最初的誘因：當代掌握着世界機運的政治家，應該從這些經騐當中去取得新的啓示吧，如果他們依舊執着於前世紀的浮誇見解，把歐洲看成國際的中心，並强使歐洲以外的情勢都附隸於他們在歐洲利益之下，這種不正確的認識，一定會引導他們去大量製造政治上的罪惡。</p>
<p>目前歐洲正進行着戰爭，交戰國雙方都集結着全力以求制勝，最近無論北海或紅海方面，鏖戰都達到酷烈程度，而最後分曉似尙非一時所能判定。在各個交戰國家。絕不應只把目光囿於歐陸一隅，而把歐洲以外的一切事變都視同無足重輕的枝葉而任意措置；如果那樣，則即使在歐洲獲得戰爭的成功，他們在歐洲以外則不免是史可悲的失敗。最近南海與南太平洋風雲驟緊，這對於歐洲各交戰國應該是個有力的警號。須知今日的戰事並不僅在歐洲進行着，歐戰固然吸引着全世界屬目，而遠東的戰事亦復牽動整個國際大局；歐戰僅屬若干歷史慘劇的再演，東方的爭戰則孕着自由獨立與正義秩序的挣扎。是以遠東問題至少應該是一個獨立的範疇，絕不能强其隨着歐洲方面的利害關係爲轉移。如果九年以前某一些政治家已因對於遠東侵略行動認識錯誤而鑄成無可挽回的大錯，則目前正在作戰中的各個國家，如再重蹈已往覆轍，其後果殆益將不可設想。</p>
<p>最近英國若干朝野人士進行開放滇緬路運動的失敗，可以證明英政府縱已因示弱讓步而飽受敎訓，却仍舊稽留於其歷史上的錯誤節段，還沒有改絃更張的決心與勇氣。緬路之封鎖於今已歷一月，中國固痛受拘束，英方又所得幾何？結果只是日本氣焰更高張，對英威脅更加甚。三個月的限期轉瞬即屆，彼時歐戰未必竟能有決定的前途，則英國究將續作不智不義的屈伏，抑或毅然作改絃更張的補過，目前尙無跡象可尋；但英當局當看淸遠東問題與歐戰截然兩事，遠東局勢的安危繫於中日戰爭之前途，而絕不能倚恃日本的「善意」。即在德義，亦當看淸日本所能提供的助力有限，而對於德義前途發展的障碍則無窮，日本對德義之是否有共患難共休戚的決心，德義當屬知之已諗，縱把歐洲敵對的形勢擴大到遠東，得利者豈是德義。</p>
<p>把歐洲認成世界的重心只是近代殖民事業獲得空前發展以後的事；即在往昔，歐洲也未嘗不深受韃靼與突厥的困擾，幾使歐陸無以自保。今日的歐洲國家已經是第三度遭遇來自東方的威脅，對於這一層，、即使其自身正在戰爭中，也不應加以輕視。這種現象其實只是基於東方侵略者漫無止境的擴展慾，絕非有所軒輊好惡於各個敵對國家之間。西方各國不乏號稱諳熟東方情事者流，實應對遠東現勢求澈底的認識和正確的方策。如果再蔽於偏見，幻想縱容遠東野火的蔓延，以改善其在歐戰中的地位，則不但連目前的近利都未可必得，到只會鼓勵征服世界妄念的昂進</p>

<p>厲行封鎖歐陸　防止民食資敵</p>
<p>吾人欲維持並實行嚴厲封鎖、不獨對德如是、卽對義法與其他被佔領國亦然、余在報端得悉希特勒亦宣布對英封鎖、此說姑妄聽之、余憶及上次大戰中、德廢皇亦會有此舉、（衆譁笑）吾人苟允食物源源輸運以供給德人而助其作戰努力、咸聽令食物接濟被蹂之人民而終爲佔領者所刻取、則不啻延長全歐之痛苦、而成一般人責備之事件、現有基於最高尙動機之許多提議、以爲食物應許通過封鎖綫以救災民、余抱歉聲明、吾人必拒絕此種請求、（衆歡呼）納粹黨自謂彼等已在歐洲造成新而統一的經濟、並屢次聲稱彼等有充分存糧、堪以供養佔領地人民、六月二十七日德國廣播曾謂胡佛接濟法比荷之計畫、固可嘉尙、但德國人民已採行必要步驟矣、以吾人所知、挪威國內當德軍侵入時存有足供一年之食物、波蘭雖非富國、然所產食物足供已用、希氏所侵犯之其他各國、亦皆在德軍侵犯時存糧頗多、且亦自產食物、如所有民食今不存在、則必已被搬去以食德國人民矣、今農田收穫甫吿完畢、故在此時與今後數月、當不致有飢饉之虞、其在今日與今冬唯一能造成歐洲任何處之飢荒者、厥爲德方之榨取或爲德方之未分配其所有食物耳、此外尙有一點可注意者、最有價値之食物、多爲製造重要戰具所必要、油脂用以製造炸藥、山芋用以煉成酒精、飛機製造中現所用之民型原料、係以牛乳製成、如德人用此食品以助其轟炸吾國婦孺、而非用以供養產此食品之良衆、則輸入之食品亦定將直接或間接用於此途、或用减輕敵方如此沿用之責任、吾人欲令希氏負完全責任、並使歐洲人民呻吟於希氏箝制之下者以種種方法襄助其解放日之來臨、吾人可事前布置對於德軍確已肅淸、自由確已恢復之處、迅速輸入食物以供民用、吾人當竭力鼓勵世界各處食物之存儲、歐人連德奧人在內、當知納粹權力之消滅、卽可使食物自由與和平立卽恢復、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>英決單獨作戰　理直終能制勝</p>
<p>英國新政府秉權以還、爲時僅三月餘、而患難之來連續不已、荷蘭不敵、其人民所愛戴之君主蒙難於外、而素稱和平之洛特丹域、變成如卅年戰爭中殘忍屠殺之塲、比利時被侵、而比王利奧波德所請派之我國遠征軍被截斷歸途、幾遭成擒、僥倖逃出、配備全失、未幾法國退出戰塲、義國又與吾人爲敵、法國全境盡入敵手、其兵工廠與大批軍用品轉資敵用、維希成立傀儡政府、隨時可爲吾敵、歐洲全部西海岸自北角以至西班牙邊界、盡在德國勢力範圍中、其所有之各口岸與飛機塲、皆可爲對英侵犯之起點、德國空軍以機數言、駕於英國之上、且已接近英島、故吾人昔所慮者今已實現、敵轟炸機不獨能於數分鐘內從許多方面飛抵英國海岸、且能獲其戰鬥機之掩護、設吾人在五月初旬遭此形勢、則似無戰後吾人定爲天之驕子或今日猶能屹然存立猶抱最後勝利信心之可能、卽世人亦不信吾人尙能生存、今日猶較昔日爲强也、（衆歡呼）今英國雖單獨作戰、然旣無所懼、更無退縮、卽前之眷念和平者、今亦唯戰爭致力、蓋吾人已團結一致、爲前所未有矣、死亡事小、失敗之恥溺職之羞事大、前途如何不能預言、將來艱苦或視今爲甚、然無論如何、吾人必應付之、吾人確知理直必勝也、</p>
<p>軍力大見增强　資源取用不竭</p>
<p>吾人不獨堅强其胸襟、且亦固其島嶼、吾人已改造陸軍而達於數月前已屬不可能之程度、吾人賴海外友人之贊助、已從大西洋外運入各種軍器安然登陸、未嘗喪折一砲一彈、吾人工廠積極工作、爲前所無、出產大增、而英國陸軍整個駐於國內、戰士二百餘萬槍械在手、隨時準備、其中四分之三在常備隊伍中、英島戰時有此大軍、此為第一次、全國皆待海上或空中侵犯者之來臨、余前於六月中旬會告下院、國內陸軍愈强、則敵方來犯之兵力必須愈厚、而我海軍在其來侵時、搗毀敵軍之工作亦將困難愈少、卽使敵軍登陸而敵方在我海軍繼續攻其交通綫時、接濟軍隊給養之困難亦必愈甚、今日如納爾遜時代第一道防綫為敵方口岸、空軍之偵察與攝影已予人以新助力、我海軍亦較初戰時為强、初戰時着手建造之軍艦現漸落成、吾人希望海外友人及時予以援助、以彌補一九三九年承平時代艦隊與一九四一年戰時艦隊間之不足、海洋公開、敵　艇猶未絕跡、磁性水雷迄未肅淸、惟英旗下商船噸數在一年無限制之潛艇戰爭與八個月嚴厲之水雷攻擊後、今較前爲大、（衆歡呼）此外吾人尙有被侵略國前避於英港之商船四百萬順　吾人各種食物儲存較承平時爲多、並進行增多食物出產之偉大程序、</p>
<p>余作此言並非自誇、當前危機尙大、惟吾人之長處與資源足以應付有餘、余之所以　述之者、因國人應知吾人信念所據之堅實原因、與吾人自覺縱係單獨作戰、縱經數年之久、仍能繼續作戰之良好理由、並因英國之依然抗戰與德國之仍遭抵抗、將使歐洲各處被蹂躪的億兆人民胸臆中、復燃其希望之火、而從此星星之火成爲呑滅納粹主義之巨熖也、</p>
<p>英國空軍優越　閃電戰成迷夢</p>
<p>過去數星期中、在英島天空進行之戰爭、近已達於高度、其範圍之大小與時期之久暫、今尙莫可預計、惟吾人必須期待敵方將作遠甚於前之更大嘗試、敵方刻仍在法國與荷蘭佈置飛行塲、而軍隊與軍器之運輸以便進攻英國者現亦在進行中、事有甚明顯者、希特希非至遭受極嚴重損毀後、不能承認對英空戰之失敗、希氏旣侈談在空戰中德方如何勝利、英方如何損失、英人如何蟄伏防空洞中叱駡其貴族政府誤國殃民、今若不進行其天空攻勢、則其造謠說謊之金石、不將愈著乎、（衆大笑）故吾人可確知希氏有此能力時、定將繼續來襲、以言空戰中之事態、則優勢屬於英方余曾於兩月前在下院聲稱、在法英戰鬥機常使德機受三對一之損失、而在鄧扣克作戰時、英機又奏一對三四之勝仗、故吾人預料在英島空戰中比率尤高、今果然矣、（衆歡呼）敵機與駕駛員之在英島上空或英國附近海上被擊退者、非被毀卽被捕、而英機與駕駛員之墮落者、則其中多有機身未毀機員無恙不久仍可參戰者、</p>
<p>戰爭決勝因素　繫於天空優勢</p>
<p>飛機出產部所主持修理毀機之辦法、偉大可驚、可使已毀飛機卽日復入戰錢、並迅速供應各種配件與飛機材料、同時英飛機與引擎出產之大增、已使各種飛機之數量逐日增多、而品質亦復改良、敵方飛機固較英國爲多、但英國新產量現已超過德國產量、而美國所出產者現方陸續運入英國、今英國轟炸機與戰鬥機之力量較任何時期爲强、此乃從每日統計而可顯見之事實也、吾人希望且相信能長期賡續空戰與敵周旋、賡續愈久則我空軍愈可迅速達到初則與敵方機數相等、繼乃佔取天空優勢之目的、戰局勝敗之決定、固大半繫於天空優勢之有無也、英戰鬥機創敵有功至可稱讚、惟英轟炸機隊夜夜轟炸敵境之工作、亦不可忘、吾人不獨能從各方面傳來之報吿、且可藉所攝影片證明英機轟炸德境軍事目標之結果、德國軍事工業·交通·飛機根據地、與軍需儲積庫之轟炸、將在逐漸增大之範圍上繼續爲之、而在一年內或將臻於以前從未夢見之程度、此種辦法非至戰事結束不止、此最非最短的但確爲最有把握達到勝利之一途</p>
<p>述及中東戰局　趨勢不欲預言</p>
<p>納粹軍隊縱獲勝和於黑海或深入裏海·或直迫印度門戶、但看德國戰爭結構之全部經濟與科學工具在國內破碎衰洛、則亦何益、自吾人在鄧扣克保全吾陸軍後、歷時愈久、則敵方大規模進犯英倫之困難亦將愈甚、吾人因此得以其海上優勢、注意於地中海、而應付前在法國困苦時無端以利刃倏刺法國後背而今在非洲與我爲敵之另一敵國、法國之背離、當然大有損於英國在中東之地位、試舉索謀里倫防務言之、吾人素依賴法軍從吉波蒂進攻義軍、益依輯利用法國在地中海之海軍與空軍根據地與北非海岸、而法國海軍亦爲吾人所依賴者、縱法國本部暫遭摧殘、然法國之海軍與其大部分陸軍及海外殖民地、應未有不與吾人共同奮門之理由、法國有强大海　與險要根據地及充分資金、大可仍爲奮鬥中大戰鬥國之一、如此法國旣可保持其生活之賡續、而其殖民地亦可與英帝國共進、以救護法國本部之獨立與完整、假使吾人易地而處、吾人定當奮鬥到底、並當視力之所及、佈置加拿大與其他自治領之海上安全、而使其有從海外進行奮鬥之工具、他國之遭德蹂躪者、大都堅忍不撓、捷克波蘭挪威荷蘭與比利時之國民今猶利刃在手、從事疆塲、而英美皆承認此奮鬥者、爲其國家有代表性之權威與合法政府、法國獨於此時五體投地、此非偉大高尙的法蘭西民族之罪、但爲維希少數人之罪、吾人對於法國人民有深切之同情、（衆歡呼）英法袍澤之舊誼並未死去、特戈爾將軍與其僚慶、今巳以有效形式表演英法同志之關係矣、此輩自由法人被判處死刑、但彼等姓名終有在自由與令譽恢復的法國各鎭各街勒石紀念之一日、此為將來必有事、如明日朝曦之復起、惟余對於將來之信念、未能影響吾人刻在地中海與非洲之難題、英軍頃已從索謀利倫撒退、中東戰塲定將有更重大之戰事、趨勢如何、余不欲預言之、吾人在中東軍隊尙多、而增援之方法亦衆、吾人在東地中海握有完全海權、吾人當盡力有以表演以忠貞堅決之方式、屨行其在世界如處之務意與責任、</p>
<p>不達作戰目標　決不放下武器</p>
<p>舍此而外、余想下院不欲余續有陳說、或有要求詳細說明英國戰目的、與英國所欲戰後和平種類者、余以爲戰事今尙在初步階段中、際此戰事方酣時、遽對此事有所演列、非善策也、惟有一方面吾人可較明白遙覩者、卽吾人不獨須爲自己着想、且亦當爲永遠安全、與吾人因以奮鬥之原則、及不列顚大聯邦之長久前途計是也、</p>

<h3 id="c85">糧食　米價復堅 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>洋米目經　兩朝轉呈徘徊後、昨開市、忽一般實銷、乘價平突出暢辦、一時浮囤散戶心思交易掀風作浪、大打出手、市色遂一反數日來平疲之態、變爲堅堅異常、節節上升一元有奇、實銷又以價昂轉淡、獲利浮戶又有趁高出籠、但已近收市時、故行情較之前市猶增六七角不等、計一號陳西貢爲五十八元六角、新尖五十七元半、二號五十三元二角、五十三元、一號邏暹五十八元半、五十八元、自傳內地幫請求之採運證十萬包、將在日內簽出、汕頭幫亦有動辦、且除收買少數現米外、頗有注神於回籠原包、暹邏二號開價六十元、繼至六十二元半、比前市又漲一元、又二號西貢開價卽至六十二元九角、後市尙在喊高、總計交易則有六七百噸、現貨開出八千多包、期現米在收市前曾見一度盤軟、蓋有浮戶出籠所致、然至收市又復挺俏、</p>
<p>周浦新粳到共四十餘担、銷　動而不爽、所以價難與他貨並秀、依然堅守原盤、續開六十一二元、粳糯國米昨乏到貨、以傳聞明暗市交易、適際洋米回秀之間、悉亦轉旺、售價並提半元之譜、開常幫淸粳六十六元半、六十六元、無錫淸粳六十五元半、六十五元、常州蘇崑粳六十四元半、次之宿六十一元、南港原包早稻六十二元半、六十一元半、斛見六十元至五十九元、金溧特元六十一元半、六十一元、常丹白元五十九元半、五十八元半、香港特元六十一元半、六十一元、中五十八元半、五十八元、砶元五十三四元、</p>
<h3 id="c86">粉麥平淡 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>麵粉、昨日現市　　、査二　粉廠盤　為十五元、福新與阜豐均可打單、聞福新廠一俟新到洋麥起　、卽行恢復開車、兼之北幫裝運麵粉、常有留難之舉、故人心未免餒弱、日廠粉綠鳳凰市價、亦因此疲落不振、計開本月份十四元三角半、九月份十四元七角半、十月份十四元八角半、成交三千餘包、內地紛及洋粉仍鮮進出、市亦平庸、</p>
<p>新小麥市况、亦無精彩、查附近車船到貨、尙不寂寞、而粉價平軟、廠方吃盤不免重視、又聞福新廠所定洋麥一船、昨巳到滬、外傳此麥爲日廠所定、迄未證實、當視福新廠開車供給情形卽可斷定也、今市高麥價爲二十三元、日廠收價爲二十一元二三角、成交日有三四千包、</p>

<p>紗市平平、局勢不離盤旋之境、但實際銷路雖無躉批發展、但香港幫零星採辦、繼續不懈、所以有一部份人心仍屬看好拖進、惟一般執貨者鑒於目前情形、大有供過於求之勢、對於遠期恐不能大漲、所以將手貨套出、爲數殊巨也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、塲內情形仍和平、無大變卦、二十支變馬開價爲九百十元、旋以搶帽子某戶在市收進一二百包、檯面稍覺乾枯、叫價漸緊、逐步漲至九百二十元、高價一到而不再上升、見風使舵者吐出、又見回挫至九百十五元、收盤仍好上一些、查半日間成交統計二千二百八十包、行情二十支變馬價予上日無甚軒輊、今日有一千五百六十五件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情形仍乏精彩可言、至於海外棉市、亦在盤旋中、而國內新棉漸次登塲、據云本年收成有良好報吿、所以人心皆抱旁觀態度、所有現棉行情、依然暗淡如故也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况堅定、且呈活躍之狀、同時又因華爾街股票價格之轉好、及一部份之本頭抵袖、結果收盤價格較之上日漲起四五磅音、印度棉市昨日連同頂測漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來又因紗價之呆滯、影響棉市交易、廠方需要亦見靜寂、同業則以市上現貨日缺、向洋行方面訂購裝船貨、已數月未有成交、且目前之兵險率頗高、折合現價較之現貨高起五十六元之巨也、</p>
<h3 id="c89">疋頭　棉布現銷　尚不寂寞 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>布市趨勢穩定、現銷此起彼伏、尙不寂寞、北幫南洋幫需要略增、各貨開價平平、上落僅一角至二角半、本街辦粗布·坯布·漂染布·絨布六百餘件、北路烟台幫辦重幫絨布·粗布·嗶嘰一百餘件、西安幫辦色布·色斜五六十件、粵港幫辦細斜·色布二百數十件、川滇幫辦士林布藍布一百餘件、國外暹邏等地辦色布漂布直貢等貨四千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布昨又轉下挫、良以實除交易平凡、市氣稍軟、十二磅龍頭細布晨開三十一元二角、後市降至三十元零九角、四君子嗶嘰九角一分左右、中檔細布及細斜、比較尙堅、升降甚微、</p>

<p>國外絲價、最近上落微尠、而交易所之買賣、亦日僅三數檔、蓋聞美國新人造絲之暢銷、甚屬驚人、眞絲地位頗有動搖之虞、何况絲價高下、絲銷雄弱、尙與日美有微妙之外交關係也、本埠絲交頗淸、英法帮進胃薄而價較高、（白廠相差四〇〇元）日商洋行亦久米動、然昨復有白廠輯里成交一百五十担云、</p>
<h3 id="c91">鳳眉珠茶　漸漸發動 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>昨日茶市、去路略動、不着色之鳳眉珠茶、因近來行家一再寄樣發電推銷、市面漸有發動趨勢、昨由錦隆同孚怡和協和等行、共進綠茶百八十餘箱、珠茶售價自二百六十五元至一百九十元、鳳眉售價二百二三十元、行情均趨穩定、紅茶亦在醞釀中、聞德商行家、頗有鉅量去胃、各茶廠多有開工趕製、以應外銷、</p>

<p>昨糖市粗白荷赤續見上展、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、本棧七十三元半、升五角、外棧上午七十三元、下午七十三元四角、升六角、老貨七十二元八角、轉口貨五十七元七角至五十八元、升半元、荷棉白KD嘜七十二元二角、TML嘜七十三元半、升五角至七角、荷赤現貨六十三元、升一元、路貨六十二元三角、又太古洋行開出卽裝荷赤五千包、價爲美金二·五六、O.I.E.例、太古車白下檔見緊、B嘜爲七十四元七角、DY嘜七十一元二角、HX嘜七十元八角、H嘜車赤六十一元、升一元、國糖有建帮開出上刁靑二百十包、六十四元、潮帮開出又九十三包、六十二元半、東鄉赤依然上漲、稍油包五十五元、次之五十四元八角、共成交二百包、漲二元許、昨由香港來糖一萬零六百三十包、</p>

<p>上海自中外通商後，浦江中帆檣林立，閩廣沙釣等船，排幫橫泊江心。查十六舖橋以南，雖與洋船無涉，而該處爲官輪船由吳淞至高昌廟所必經之地，一遇風潮漲激，時虞碰撞，更有船戶之壓儎泥石及居民舖戶之垃圾，時或拋入浦江，於水利實有大礙。前由蘇松太道劉觀察派委張翰卿司馬，曁松海防吳分府，自十六舖橋起至南碼頭止，沿岸勘明界址，釘呈界樁，以示碼頭限制。現又札委張司馬會同廳縣，設立南段水利局。自十六舖橋至龍華一帶，設有洋式杉板巡船四隻，派司事巡丁晝夜逡巡，專管浦邊界樁，指引閩廣沙船等分幫停泊，以及稽查拋棄泥石，沿浦興築碼頭等事。並派熟悉水利之人，隨時分段測量，如有淤淺妨碍行船之處，堅立標桿，以示趨避。遇有與新關理船廳交涉事件，仍須和衷商辦。茲已定在江海大關南首洞庭山碼頭弄內，卽安康莊西間壁，租屋設立總局，更於南卡設立分巡船隻，由管帶砲船之沈都都戎，幫同辦理云。</p>

<h3 id="c95">理想與現實 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 王達</p>
<p>現實就是宇宙間一切不可否認的具體事實，牠的範圍極爲廣大，上至一個民族一種社會的存在，下至一草一木的成長，以及各種與我們日常生活息息相關的事物，無不包括其中。理想則是我們內在的一種心理活動，牠總是駕乎具體事實之上的；然而牠並不同於幻想或妄想，因爲牠是由我們想智所創造，而經過正確理性的判斷的。可以簡單說來，現實卽我們外圍的實在環境，而心理是我們心智的可能想像。</p>
<p>現實旣然環圍我們身外，那末牠影饗及我們的勢力，顯而易見是巨大而且不可抵抗的。因襲的風俗習慣，人爲的法律規條，以及社會的道德標準，無時不在向我們施用其壓力。而且不論牠對於我們有利或是有害，我們却非和牠打交涉不可。因此，應付當前現實，便成了每人生活上的第一要義</p>
<p>但是倘若現實的環境過分惡劣，予人的困惱日益增加，那末，人便要不由自主地，本自己的愛好而發生種種的慾望和理想，一到相當的時機，他便要決然而起反抗環境，憑藉他自己的智能以改造一個合乎他的理想的環境。所以有時我們竟可以說今日之理想常能成爲明日之現實，這種例子在文明進化史上是不難找到的。例如民主政制在暴虐的專制時代，只是一個在萌芽中的理想；同樣，在科學的園地裏，今日飛機能飛行的事實也正是昔人看見紙鳶騰空時所懷抱的理想呵。</p>
<p>這樣看來，理想和現實可說是人類進化途程中的兩個良伴，實在是幷行而不悖，缺一而不可的。根據現實，產生理想，再由理想演進而爲事實。這樣往復不息的循環，就是推進文化史論的動力。然而茫茫人海中，却往往有許多人故作偏抑之論，不是厚現實以薄理想，便是抑理想以仰現實。這實在是不明智的舉動。一般而論，偏重現實的結果，易流於庸俗卑鄙。犯這種病的人，祇知茍安圖存，逆來順受屈服於現實環境之下，利之所在，趨之若驚，見小利而忘大義，漠然無生人之情。反之，過度耽於理想的人，日惟沉緬於理想的美境內，與現實相距日遙，反自詡爲卓然不同於凡俗。不知一旦美夢吿終，生活逼使他面對現實之時，却不免因隔閡日久，以致應付維艱。這樣岐途徘徊，終至看透自己對人類文明毫無貢獻，轉而萬念俱灰，日趨悲觀，無以自拔。</p>
<p>所以，正當的人生觀，首先是要認淸現實，把握現實，然後再由本人心智的啟發，時時懷抱一種正確無誤力所能及的理想，以進人類的文明福利的改進爲目標，在人生的大道上向前邁進。這樣，個人才算是在他自己的壁壘內貢獻了他對於全體的努力。現在正是人類文明行將沉淪的前夜，時代的靑年們應該猛省，認明自己的任務，趕緊認淸現實，確定理想，勇敢地接受惡環境的挑戰，而爲自己的理想作決死的奮鬥！</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3 id="c96">父親 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 郁郁</p>
<p>勞動了一天的身體，時時爲鹽質的汗液所浸濕，每當夕陽沉入海底，微風吹動衣衫的時候，誰也得想到洗個澡，移張籐椅往風口坐一會。遇着有愛談笑的老年人，就同左右鄰居述說些古今的事故，嘆息着今不如昔，一年不如一年了。年輕的人便用着愛聽而帶尊敬的臉色盡心注聽着，不時還發着些驚呀的疑問。醫如：「那時米賣四元一擔嗎？眞便宜！」「公公，那時電車有了嗎？」</p>
<p>假如有人對這老掌故沒有味的話，可以獨坐在比較背風的地方，輕揮着蒲扇，回憶着什麽，思量着什麽，也是很快意的。那時誰也不會注意到，還有一個人在沉靜裏生活着的</p>
<p>近來朋友們看到我都說我變了，我自己也覺得和以前有些異樣。自從父親今春故世之後，我年輕時喜動的性格也隨着父親葬送了，我寗願獨自悵悵地坐着，再不似以前逢到人家談起掌故便靜靜地坐在旁邊聽了。這也許是因爲我再也不能找到我父親的聲音在夏日的傍晚的緣故吧！</p>
<p>從小我便和父親睡在一牀，直到我在學校裏住讀爲止。記得以前每晚，無論是冬季或夏季，我總愛聽父親講些故事之類，及到後來父親的故事都給我聽厭了，於是轉到問起以前的事了。父親常吿訴我他以前的奮鬥史，怎樣家裏借了十二元錢就到南京去讀書；怎樣二十歲便爲了生活坐騾車上張家口，諸如此類，時常還夾雜些鼓勵我的話：「你看，你看，我從前在學校裏，每天吃的是蘿蔔乾飯，眞和現在不能比了，你們得用心讀書呵！」</p>
<p>在去年的夏季，父親也許是覺得自己年老將不長人世了，怕他的一生經歷會給人遺忘似的，更比往日說得多了。往往一樁事說了又說，我也好像不厭其煩地傾聽着，有時還故意問他些自己明明知道得很淸楚的問題。每當時間講得太晚了，他總是用蒼老的聲音這樣說：「我一生的經歷多極了，談幾月都談不完，等天凉了我很想寫一本書，噯，眞得寫一本書。」</p>
<p>天是凉過了，並且已由凉又轉到熱，父親述說一生經歷的書終於沒有寫好。父親的蒼老的聲音也永遠不能再聽到，就連父親的影子也快將爲熟識的人們稍稍地遺忘了。</p>
<p>近來朋友們說我變了，是的，我變了，我的環境也變了。像納凉時的閑談再也引不起我的興趣了，我寗願孤獨地坐在背風的地方熟思和回憶，因爲父親的聲音再也不能在什麽地方我到了。</p>

<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>倪金壽勉强在書桌旁邊的沙發上坐下，自動地報吿他的經過。那忠實的老僕施桂，也十二分關懷地在門口邊旁聽。</p>
<p>他說：「剛才霍先生打電話給我，我恰巧回署，便將我調查余甘棠和陸健笙昨夜裏的行踪的情形吿訴他。接着我問他的經過情形，他也吿訴我趙伯雄住在亞東七樓七七四號，不過已經搬走。他又吿訴我，就在那時，無意中瞧見了余甘棠，你已經跟他到樓上去。我正待要跟他商量一個會面的地點，預備怎樣進行，又想叫他把余甘棠立刻捉住，忽然電話筒中砰的一聲，好像打碎一塊玻璃的樣子，以後便沒有他的聲音了。接着嗡嗡地一陣，好像是一種紛擾，我知道一定出了什麼岔子。」</p>
<p>我等他停一停的機會，接續發問：「以後你便趕到亞東去，是不是？」</p>
<p>倪金壽點頭道：「是的，可是不巧得很，我的汽車一路碰到紅燈，躭擱了不少時候。我到旅館時，除了電話間的玻璃門打碎了一塊此外，竟並無異狀，連地上的碎玻璃也掃去了。」</p>
<p>「你沒有瞧見霍桑嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有，電話間空着，門外又沒有人。」</p>
<p>我暗忖我下電梯時電話間門口還有四五個人，大概倪金壽到亞東的時候，還在我離開以後。我當時絕對不曾想到有這一回事，所以速電話間門上的玻璃碎掉，也不曾瞧見。</p>
<p>我又道：「你當然要向旅館的職員們查問。」</p>
<p>倪金壽答道：「是的，那旅館的職員不認識霍桑，祇說有一個拿着一件鼠色薄呢外衣，穿着藏靑西裝的人，在打電話時被什麽人開了一槍。那兇手當塲逃走，他們也沒有瞧見是個什麽樣人。那中槍的人馬上倒地，但一回兒就爬起來，用白手巾按着面頰走出去。他們要把他送醫院去，那人不答應，便自己走出去。他們自然抱着『多一事不如少一事』的宗旨，連審署都不曾報吿。我料想這中槍的人，一定是霍先生無疑。」（八三）</p>

<h3 id="c100">葛萊泰嘉寳的蹤影史 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>經過了十五年的競爭，嘉寶仍毫無改變的站在好萊塢。雖然近於中年，未免美人遲暮，可是她依然紅得發紫。任何競爭者都不能與之抗衡，這難道是偶然的嗎？</p>
<p>嘉寳沒有到好萊塢之前，在瑞典，幾乎沒有人知道她，自從她認識大導演史梯萊，她才踏上了偉大的前途；他帶她到好萊塢，介紹她進米高梅公司。合同是第一年周薪四百元，第二年周薪六百元，第三年周薪七百五十元。</p>
<p>起初，誰也沒有注意到這位異國女兒，但在「在流」一片以後，全世界的觀衆都震動了，在電影界他們發現了一個奇特的靈魂。那時她對於好萊塢毫不感興趣，尤共是在她得到成功的時候，史梯萊因爲不能了解美國人的性格和心理而失敗，這更使她失望，她幾乎要同她的恩人回祖國去，要不是史梯萊苦苦的勸阻她。</p>
<p>以後，她遇到了的翰吉爾勃，一位稍稍同情她的人。他們合作過幾張片子，日夕的親近，把她的人生觀改變了許多</p>
<p>當她一步步得到成功的時候，從瑞典傳來許多噩耗！她的親愛的妹妹死了，她的恩人史梯萊死了。很勇敢地，她一面流淚，一面工作。可是心境不佳，使她不得不跟大衆們遠離。「神秘女郞」，便是這時一般人贈給她的雅號。</p>
<p>從無聲到有聲，她盛名沒有一點兒衰退，反而更形活躍，先後曾主演不少名片，如：“Mata　Hari”“Romance”「瓊宮恨史」「大飯店」，待「春殘夢斷」拍完，她曾返瑞典一行。當省視故鄉歸來，與羅勃泰勒合演「茶花女」，與却爾斯鮑育合演「拿破侖秘史」，與茂文道格拉斯合演「妮娜琦珈」，最近的新作是「居里夫人傳記」“Madame　Curie”男主角是嘉寳指定的史本塞屈賽，據說在這張片子裏，她不但笑，而且要開口唱歌了。</p>

<p>沈曼華王鴻福繼譚登台</p>
<p>譚富英陳麗芳一行，已於昨日期滿輟演，後局准由沈曼華王鴻福接替，合同訂定牛月，期滿再由吳素秋遲世恭賡續登臺，現曼華正在滬上，鴻福已於二十日由靑乘輪南下，一俟王伶到滬，卽可開始露演。茲將沈王二伶之劇藝，簡記於下：</p>
<p>沈爲蘇之虞山人，自幼卽僑寓故都，性好皮黃十餘齡已能登臺綵唱，初習靑衣，後兼學花衫諸劇，梅畹華聞其歌，許爲可造且列爲門墻。曼華經梅提携後，求學之心乃益切，梅亦樂爲之指引，後在故都出演數載，聲譽在魏蓮芳林秋雯朱琴心之上，蓋其嗓昔淸亮甜潤，幾可以亂梅氏之眞也。曼華擅長旦脚以外，小生亦爲其絕活之一如白門樓轅門射戟飛虎山監酒令岳家莊探莊諸劇，演來亦有聲有色，所謂師承有自，（曼華亦姜妙香得意弟子）不同凡饗也。此次更新靑黃不接之時，乃有沈曼華王鴻福合作之組織，且留名小生姜妙香爲之輔佐，洵屬奇兵突出。王鴻福，生角，一名小寳芬，在靑濟一帶頗負盛名，曾一度在海上獻藝，且挑大樑。鴻福之藝，愚未之見，惟據名票友羅曲緣王大邦二兄吿語，則謂鴻福之本領，京朝派中實無人足與之敵云。</p>
<h3 id="c103">「原野」觀感 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 阿漢</p>
<p>一般的論起來，「原野」沒有「雷雨」那樣的緊湊，沒有「日出」一般的悲壯，然而，綜合的評價，「原野」的蓄意，陳詞，一切的反映都足高過「雷雨」「日出」。因爲它是暴露着舊社會封建勢力的黑暗，從黑暗中，葬送了前一輩人，又葬送了今一輩人，但是，後一輩人却該向着黑暗的環境，以至於社會的制度搏鬥，創造人類的光明！</p>
<p>反觀今日的社會，雖然已非「原野」問世的時代。但是，仇虎的生命，還是在年靑伙伴的羣衆中生長着，沒落着，多多少少被以一種「莫須有」的罪名犧牲了，葬送了。劇中，仇虎報了他的仇，復了他的恨，沒有一點情感作用的大胆幹了，卽使最後結果，他用自己的刀來作爲生命的歸宿。這個，仇虎提示着：爲了將來的子孫，前代的人們應該爲自己解放了枷鎖。</p>
<p>黃河的個性，始終是一個時代的硬漢，他有理智，他有情感，因此：演戲時候，就也以他的個性來作劇中人的發揮了。所以主演仇虎，在個性演技上是配合的。孫景璐的年齡雖則很輕，却已抓有多方面的作風，她的金子，完全掩去「日出」中翠喜「雷雨」中四鳳的氣度，而以一種鄕村女子浪漫潑辣的姿態典型化的表演出來，因此也就博到優美的效果。張雪梅的焦母，凶暴，吳景平的大星懦弱，葛鑫的傻子，愚蠢仇虎的常玉呆純，一切人物都具性格化，交錯於舊社會崩潰的前夜，演技的傳達，都足動人的。在佈景音響上，「原野」演出的配置是成功的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Several Elite Chinese Army Divisions Deployed on the Yunnan-Vietnam Border; Chairman Chiang and Others Inspect Defense in Yunnan; Chinese Counteroffensive in Longzhou Strives to Prevent Japanese Advance to the West <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Kunming Correspondence: The crisis in Yunnan Province is worsening. The Japanese Hanoi Inspection Group, led by Major General Nishihara, has begun negotiations with French authorities regarding the establishment of naval and air bases in Vietnam. The aim is to attack Yunnan Province and increase Japan's control over Vietnam. These negotiations have been ongoing since last week. However, the Japanese side claims that these negotiations are to discuss increasing trade between Japan and Vietnam. If the Japanese obtain land and air bases in Hanoi and Haiphong, it will greatly facilitate their attack on Yunnan Province. It is widely expected that the Japanese troops in Longzhou, southwestern Guangxi, will launch a large-scale invasion of Yunnan to assist the offensive from Vietnam. Several divisions of elite Chinese troops have been deployed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. It is reported that General Chiang Kai-shek and Generals Bai Chongxi and Yang Jie visited Yunnan last weekend to inspect the defense of Yunnan and conferred with Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province and military leader of the province. If the Vietnamese authorities yield to Japan, the Chinese troops stationed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border will take offensive action when necessary. An unconfirmed report states that several Chinese soldiers crossed the border into Vietnam earlier this month, escorting cargo trucks and a large amount of gasoline in front of Japanese inspectors. These Chinese soldiers were extremely well-trained and well-equipped. As a result, Lieutenant General Catroux was removed from his post as Governor-General of Indochina and replaced by Vice Admiral Decoux, commander of the French Far East Fleet. It is reported that the French fleet has left Haiphong to avoid being encircled by the Japanese navy, as the Japanese naval power in Tokyo Bay far exceeds that of the French. Currently, the Chinese army is launching a major counteroffensive in the southern, northeastern, and central parts of Longzhou to prevent the Japanese army from moving west from Longzhou to invade Yunnan. (21st International News Agency)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News recently reported that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has rejected all demands made by the Japanese side and has put forward a counter-proposal, demanding that future Japanese inspectors not be allowed to land and enter Vietnam, and that the two Japanese warships anchored offshore should leave immediately. The Kuomin Kung Pao, under the large-character headline "Thailand and Vietnam Jointly Resist Japan," declared that a Thai military delegation, led by senior military leaders, will arrive in Hanoi to discuss joint defense between the two countries with the Vietnamese Governor to resist the Japanese advance southward. In describing the Vietnamese Governor's rejection of the four demands made by the Japanese side, the newspaper also stated that France has concentrated more than thirty warships in Vietnamese waters, which have come from Madagascar. The newspaper also claimed that Japan has concentrated nearly thirty warships in Tokyo Bay and sixty warships along the coast of Hainan Island. The newspaper also stated that Japanese warships have repeatedly violated French waters within Guangzhou Bay. It also stated that on August 10, the French authorities in Guangzhou Bay disarmed many Chinese police officers. According to well-informed sources, at a time when France and Japan are about to clash over Vietnam, Thailand's true attitude is an important issue concerning the Far Eastern political situation. It is understood that the news they have obtained from various parts of Southeast Asia regarding Thailand's attitude is quite different. The Thai government seems to be wavering at the crossroads of two paths. The first path is to join hands with Japan and take the opportunity to send troops to recover eastern Cambodia, which it considers lost territory, when Japan invades Annam and Tokyo. The second path is to unite with France to jointly resist Japan's invasion of the Indochina Peninsula. The Thai military delegation may submit its recommendations to Bangkok for a decision. (21st United Press)</p>
<p>London: Reliable sources recently stated that the US government recently notified the Japanese government that Britain is very concerned about the current situation in Vietnam. The source also said that Washington has sent a similar policy statement to Tokyo. It is reported that these Anglo-American notes were sent to the Japanese government after news of Japan's request to use Vietnam as a base was released. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Far East and Europe <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Whether the center of the world today is Europe or the East is naturally not a question that can be decided in a few words. From an economic and commercial point of view alone, Europe held supreme authority until the eve of this great war, and therefore did not lose its leading position. However, when it comes to the political destiny of the world, the view that Europe dominates the world, which prevailed half a century or even a century ago, has clearly become outdated. At the very least, the many changes taking place internationally are no longer determined solely by forces in Europe. The Versailles Conference, which resolved the post-World War I situation, only produced some clumsy and impractical proposals for the Far East. The events in the Far East that began in September 1931 formed the initial trigger for this European war. Contemporary politicians who control the world's destiny should draw new insights from these experiences. If they continue to cling to the flamboyant views of the previous century, viewing Europe as the center of the international community and forcing the situation outside of Europe to be subordinate to their interests in Europe, this incorrect understanding will inevitably lead them to produce a large number of political crimes.</p>
<p>War is currently underway in Europe, with both belligerents mobilizing all their forces to achieve victory. Recently, fierce battles have reached a brutal level in the North Sea and the Red Sea, but the final outcome does not seem to be determined in the short term. In all the warring countries, they should not only confine their eyes to a corner of the European continent, and arbitrarily dispose of all events outside Europe as insignificant branches. If that is the case, even if they achieve success in the war in Europe, they will inevitably suffer a tragic failure outside of Europe. The recent rapid tightening of the situation in the South China Sea and the South Pacific should be a powerful warning to the European belligerents. It must be understood that today's war is not only being waged in Europe. The European war certainly attracts worldwide attention, but the war in the Far East also affects the entire international situation. The European war is only a re-enactment of some historical tragedies, while the struggle in the East is pregnant with the struggle for freedom, independence, and a just order. Therefore, the Far Eastern issue should at least be an independent category, and it must not be forced to change with the interests of Europe. If some politicians nine years ago made an irreparable mistake due to a mistaken understanding of the Far Eastern aggression, then the consequences will be even more unimaginable if the countries currently at war repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>The recent failure of some British officials and people to promote the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road proves that although the British government has been thoroughly taught a lesson by showing weakness and making concessions, it is still lingering in the erroneous segments of its history and has not yet made the determination and courage to change its course. The blockade of the Burma Road has been going on for a month. China has certainly been severely restricted, but what has Britain gained? As a result, Japan's arrogance has become even more arrogant, and its threats to Britain have become even greater. The three-month deadline will be reached in an instant. At that time, the European war may not be able to have a decisive future. Will Britain continue to make unwise and unjust surrenders, or will it resolutely change its course and make up for its mistakes? There are currently no signs to be found. However, the British authorities should see clearly that the Far Eastern issue and the European war are two completely different things. The safety of the Far Eastern situation depends on the future of the Sino-Japanese War, and it must not rely on Japan's "goodwill". Even in Germany and Italy, they should see clearly that the assistance that Japan can provide is limited, and the obstacles to the future development of Germany and Italy are endless. Germany and Italy should know that Japan is determined to share weal and woe with Germany and Italy. Even if the opposing situation in Europe is expanded to the Far East, the beneficiaries will not be Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Recognizing Europe as the center of the world only occurred after the unprecedented development of modern colonial undertakings. Even in the past, Europe was deeply troubled by the Tartars and Turks, so that the European continent could not protect itself. Today, the European countries have encountered threats from the East for the third time, and even if they are at war themselves, they should not underestimate this point. This phenomenon is actually only based on the endless expansionist desires of the Eastern aggressors, and there is absolutely no preference for or aversion to the various opposing countries. There is no shortage of people in the West who claim to be familiar with the affairs of the East. They should seek a thorough understanding and correct strategy for the current situation in the Far East. If they are blinded by prejudice again and imagine that they can improve their position in the European war by condoning the spread of the Far Eastern wildfire, they will not only fail to obtain the immediate benefits they seek, but will only encourage the advancement of the delusion of conquering the world.</p>
<h3 id="e11">British Prime Minister Formally Announces Lease of Western Hemisphere Territories to US for Defense; Term Set at Ninety-Nine Years; Details to be Discussed Soon <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Churchill, in a long speech in the House of Commons last night on the current war situation, made the most important announcement: "A few months ago, we realized that for the benefit of both Britain and the United States, the United States should have naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere to prevent Nazi countries from acquiring temporary or long-term control over most of Western Europe's land and resources. Therefore, we decided to notify the US government that we would be willing to grant the United States this kind of defense convenience and lease appropriate areas in Britain's Atlantic territories to the United States to consolidate its security and prevent future dangers. We have taken this action voluntarily, neither at the request of others nor with any expectations. The principle of the union of interests between Britain and the United States to respond to common purposes has been demonstrated in several agreements before the war, such as the matter of several small islands in the Pacific Ocean now becoming important refueling points. We are in complete agreement with the Canadian government on this matter. We now know that the United States is also concerned about the air and naval defenses of the Atlantic coast, and President Roosevelt has recently stated that he is willing to discuss with us, Canada, and Newfoundland the problem of the United States developing its naval and air force facilities in Newfoundland and the West Indies. Of course, there is no question of transferring sovereignty in this matter, nor is it contrary to the wishes of the relevant colonies. The British government is willing to provide the United States with defense conveniences by means of a ninety-nine-year lease. We are certain that our interests and the interests of the United States, as well as the interests of Canada and Newfoundland, will all benefit from this. Undoubtedly, this approach will unite the two major democratic countries of Britain and the United States in some of their affairs and seek mutual common welfare. This trend will continue to flow like the Mississippi River, and nothing can stop it." (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Halifax, in replying to questions during debate in the House of Lords as to whether British discussion with America would affect bases outside the Atlantic, such as Singapore, said: "Anglo-American negotiations, confined to the Atlantic, West Indies and Newfoundland, have now been agreed upon in principle, but have not yet begun to discuss details. However, he was gratified that no great difficulties would arise in the discussion of details." (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>New York: President Roosevelt told reporters at Hyde Park, New York yesterday that US talks with Britain on obtaining naval and air bases were proceeding satisfactorily, but that he was unwilling to predict when concrete developments could be expected. Asked if he had reached agreement with Canadian Prime Minister King on the establishment of a US-Canada joint defense council, with the possibility of using US destroyers, the President replied that this was merely a press report. (21st Reuters)</p>

<p>Hyde Park: President Roosevelt said yesterday that he would announce the dispatch of an eleven-member committee on Thursday to participate in the formation of a permanent US-Canada joint defense. (21st United Press)</p>
<p>Ottawa: It is heard that Canadian Prime Minister King will convene a special parliament in mid-September to pass the US-Canada joint defense bill. (21st United Press)</p>
<p>Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King stated yesterday at a press reception that the mission of the Canadian-American Defense Committee was largely to study mutual defense and provide consultation. The committee will contribute new ideas on national defense to both governments. This does not mean that Canada is avoiding its responsibilities, but that Canada will assume its share of mutual obligations. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: Those opposed to intervention in the European war are increasingly worried about the relationship between the United States and Canada, which is already a de facto alliance. They say that the Senate, which is responsible for US foreign affairs, has not yet commented on the dramatic changes in foreign policy. In addition to military affairs, economic affairs are now also showing signs of preparation for intervention. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's trip to Canada is said to be related to loans. He may fly to Britain to discuss lending aid to Britain with Churchill. As for the US dispatch of warships, it is not very important. The New York Sun's Washington correspondent said that the Senate's current problem is whether Britain will soon join the US in resisting Germany with its naval and air forces. US neutrality has become empty talk. Sending warships to aid Britain and compulsory military service are only a small part of the problems that Roosevelt wants to solve before the presidential election. (21st Haitong Agency)</p>
<p>US Has Entered Emergency Period; Members of Congress Approve Sale of Warships</p>
<p>Washington: Members of Congress yesterday continued to support the statement that the executive leader has completed a plan to transfer fifty US destroyers to Britain through Canada as an intermediary. However, the Navy Department refused to comment on the matter. According to reports, once the US-Canada defense treaty is formally signed, Canada will be supplied with several destroyers by the United States. A Navy Department spokesman said, "We have no official documents to release regarding the sale of destroyers to foreign governments," but he said that the Navy Department will express its views on the matter to President Roosevelt. (21st United Press)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Wheeler yesterday gave a national broadcast, opposing the US sale of destroyers to Britain, and said that America's first line of defense is its own navy and the ocean between the US, Europe, and Asia, not the British navy. In principle, there is no such thing as "non-war-like" aid. The current priority is to maintain America's way of life. We must recognize that war destroys our democracy." He also said, "The last European war has proved that democracy cannot be saved on the European battlefield." He advised the people to be careful of sweet words and to remember the facts that accompany war, namely death, destruction, and poverty. (21st United Press)</p>
<p>Washington: US Ambassador to France Bullitt gave a speech in Philadelphia a few days ago, and Undersecretary of State Welles responded yesterday, announcing that the State Department fully endorses this speech, that the United States has entered an emergency period, and that it must have people like Bullitt who have witnessed the actual situation report truthfully.

<p>Former British Secretary of War Belisha Says European War Promotes Anglo-American Union</p>
<p>London: Former Secretary of War Belisha claimed that the result of the European war may lead to an Anglo-American union. In discussing Churchill's speech, he said that the mixing of British and American interests is now inevitable. Everything the Prime Minister said about US relations is enough to compensate for a diplomatic mission. If this trend can unite the British and American people, it is enough to compensate for the scourge of the European war. (21st United Press)</p>

<p>Vatican City: According to those close to Myron Taylor yesterday, President Roosevelt's representative to the Vatican, Myron Taylor, will return to the United States soon to consult with the President on his work here. They said that Taylor was unwilling to discuss his future plans, so it was impossible to know whether he would return to Rome after meeting with the President or remain in the United States.

<p>Washington: New Jersey Republican Congressman Thomas recently wrote to Secretary of War Stimson, saying that the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone and Puerto Rico are completely inadequate and should be improved. He said that the defenses of these two places have not been improved in the slightest in thirty years. Thomas advocated increasing anti-aircraft guns, ammunition depots, hand-held machine guns, aircraft, tanks, etc. in these two places, and believed that Panama's oil storage and ammunition depots should be built underground. He also believed that Puerto Rico's air force was too weak, with only twelve aircraft. However, he praised the morale of the troops stationed in Panama and Puerto Rico. (21st United Press)</p>

<p>London: During a meeting of the House of Commons today, a question was raised asking whether, in view of the closure of the Burma Road, which prevents the transport of military supplies to China, the government would propose to cancel the 1 million barrels of oil produced by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which is controlled by the British government, that were sold to Japan in April 1940. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that he could not add anything to the reply made by the Minister of Petroleum on April 23. Liberal Party MP Mander rose to speak, saying, "On the one hand, oil is supplied to Japan to attack China, while at the same time China is not allowed to obtain this supply from the Burma Road. Can there be anything more unfair than this?" Butler replied that, as the Minister of Petroleum announced on April 23, the British government had stated that its policy was not to interfere in the company's commercial activities. According to the Minister of Petroleum's reply to a question on April 23 of this year, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company supplies Japan with a large amount of oil on a purely commercial basis. Although the government holds a large share in the company, it has declared its policy of non-interference in the company's commercial activities. (21st Reuters)</p>

<p>Mexico City - Former Soviet Communist leader and founder of the Red Army, Trotsky, was violently attacked in his study yesterday by a friend with an axe, suffering severe wounds to the head, shoulders, and knees. He is currently in critical condition in an oxygen tent at the Green Cross Emergency Hospital. Although doctors have administered stimulants, his breathing remains very weak. Doctors are making every effort to save him. The man who wounded Trotsky is 36 years old, named Teriou, and is a reporter for a Paris newspaper, fluent in English and French. He has been arrested at the police station. According to the guards at Trotsky's villa, speaking to an Associated Press reporter, Trotsky was attacked at 4:20 PM yesterday. They believe Teriou must have directly entered Trotsky's room to commit the act. At the time of the incident, guards outside the door heard Trotsky's cries and immediately rushed into the room, apprehending the assassin.

<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill reported on the current war situation in the House of Commons last night. In his address, he: (1) Declared Britain's intention to maintain and implement a strict blockade not only against Germany but also against Italy, France, and other occupied countries; (2) Urged the nation to prepare for the wars of 1941 and 1942 in a determined and systematic manner; (3) Expressed the British government's unwavering determination to continue fighting to achieve victory; (4) Praised the loyalty and bravery of British pilots and the excellence of British aircraft; (5) Reported that the British Navy is stronger than at the beginning of the war, but expressed the hope that overseas friends could provide timely assistance to Britain to fill the gap between the fleet in peacetime 1939 and the fleet in wartime 1941; (6) Expressed gratitude for the United States' supply of large quantities of guns and ammunition of various kinds; (7) Announced that the production of new British aircraft has now caught up with Germany, and that American aircraft are gradually arriving in Britain. Mr. Churchill spoke for 68 minutes. Upon finishing his speech and taking his seat, the entire House cheered.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister told the House of Commons that Britain has lost nearly 92,000 people since the start of the war, including those killed, seriously wounded, captured, and missing. In contrast, the losses in the first twelve months of the last Great War reached 365,000. We must actively prepare for war in the next two or three years. Although human life is short, two or three years is not a long time. Two or three years is insignificant in the history of a nation. We are currently doing the most honorable thing in the world, being the sole guarantor of freedom for all of Europe. Therefore, during these two or three years of hardship, we must not complain. Our efforts in the future are not limited to self-defense. Where there is a will, there is a way. We must prepare everything and not miss any opportunities. The way to quickly end the war is not in empty words, but in showing the enemy that we have the will and ability not only to fight for a long time, but also to inflict heavy blows on the enemy. The path to final victory may not be as distant as we expect. This is something we cannot predict. No matter how long or short the road is, or how dangerous or easy it is, we must reach its end. (Loud cheers)</p>
<p>Strictly Enforce Blockade of the European Continent to Prevent Civilian Food from Aiding the Enemy</p>
<p>We want to maintain and implement a strict blockade, not only against Germany but also against Italy, France, and other occupied countries. I learned from the press that Hitler has also announced a blockade against Britain. Let us listen to this statement with a grain of salt. I recall that the German Emperor also did this during the last Great War. (Laughter from the audience) If we allow food to be transported in an endless stream to supply the Germans and help their war effort, or if we allow food to be supplied to the ravaged people and ultimately seized by the occupiers, then we would be prolonging the suffering of all of Europe and becoming the target of general condemnation. There are currently many proposals based on the noblest of motives that food should be allowed to pass through the blockade to save disaster victims. I regret to state that we must reject such requests. (Loud cheers) The Nazi Party claims that they have created a new and unified economy in Europe and have repeatedly stated that they have sufficient stocks to feed the people of the occupied territories. On June 27th, German radio stated that Hoover's plan to supply Belgium, France, and the Netherlands was admirable, but the German people have already taken the necessary steps. As far as we know, Norway had enough food to last a year when the German army invaded. Although Poland is not a wealthy country, it produces enough food for its own consumption. The other countries invaded by Hitler also had ample food reserves and produced their own food at the time of the German invasion. If all civilian food is now gone, it must have been moved to feed the German people. The harvest has just been completed, so there should be no risk of famine at this time or in the coming months. The only thing that can cause famine anywhere in Europe today and this winter is German extraction or German failure to distribute all the food they possess. Furthermore, one point worth noting is that the most valuable food is often necessary for the manufacture of important war materials. Oils are used to make explosives, sweet potatoes are used to make alcohol, and the civilian-type raw materials currently used in aircraft manufacturing are made from milk. If the Germans use these foods to help them bomb our women and children, rather than to feed the good people who produce these foods, then the imported food will also be used directly or indirectly for this purpose, or to reduce the enemy's responsibility for doing so. We want to hold Hitler fully responsible and help the people of Europe groaning under Hitler's yoke in every way possible to hasten the arrival of their liberation. We can arrange in advance to quickly import food for civilian use where the German army has been cleared and freedom has been restored. We should do our best to encourage the storage of food everywhere in the world. Europeans, including Germans and Austrians, should know that the destruction of Nazi power will immediately restore food freedom and peace. (Loud cheers)</p>
<p>Britain is Determined to Fight Alone; Righteousness Will Ultimately Prevail</p>
<p>The new British government has been in power for only three months, and misfortunes have come one after another. The Netherlands could not resist. Its beloved monarch suffered abroad, and Rotterdam, known for its peace, became a scene of cruel massacres like those in the Thirty Years' War. Belgium was invaded, and the expeditionary force sent by King Leopold was cut off from its return route, almost captured, and barely escaped, losing all its equipment. Soon after, France withdrew from the battlefield, and Italy became our enemy. The entire territory of France fell into enemy hands, and its arsenals and large quantities of military supplies were transferred to enemy use. The Vichy puppet government was established and could become our enemy at any time. The entire west coast of Europe, from the North Cape to the Spanish border, is within Germany's sphere of influence, and all its ports and airfields can be used as launching points for an invasion of Britain. The German air force, in terms of numbers, surpasses Britain's and has approached the British Isles. Thus, what we feared in the past has now become a reality. Enemy bombers can not only reach the British coast from many directions in a matter of minutes, but also gain the cover of their fighter planes. If we had faced this situation in early May, it would have seemed impossible that we would be the darlings of heaven after the war, or that we would still be standing tall today with confidence in final victory. Even the world did not believe that we could still survive. Today, we are stronger than we were in the past. (Loud cheers) Although Britain is fighting alone now, it has nothing to fear and will not retreat. Even those who previously longed for peace are now dedicated to the war, because we are more united than ever before. Death is a small matter; the shame of failure and the disgrace of neglecting one's duty are great matters. How the future will unfold cannot be predicted. The hardships ahead may be even greater than they are now, but no matter what, we must deal with them. We are certain that righteousness will prevail.</p>
<p>Military Strength Greatly Enhanced; Resources Inexhaustible</p>
<p>We have not only strengthened our resolve, but also fortified our islands. We have reorganized the army to an extent that was impossible just months ago. With the support of overseas friends, we have transported various weapons across the Atlantic and landed them safely, without losing a single cannon or bullet. Our factories are working actively as never before, with greatly increased production. The entire British army is stationed in the country, with over two million soldiers armed, ready at any moment, three-quarters of whom are in regular units. This is the first time in wartime that Britain has had such a large army on the British Isles. The whole country awaits the arrival of invaders from the sea or air. I told the House of Commons in mid-June that the stronger the land army in the country, the thicker the enemy's invading forces must be, and the less difficult it will be for our navy to destroy the enemy forces when they invade. Even if the enemy lands and our navy continues to attack their lines of communication, the difficulty of supplying the troops will be even greater. Today, as in Nelson's time, the first line of defense is the enemy's ports. Aerial reconnaissance and photography have provided new assistance. Our navy is also stronger than it was at the beginning of the war. Warships that began construction at the beginning of the war are now gradually being completed. We hope that overseas friends will provide timely assistance to make up for the inadequacy between the fleet in peacetime 1939 and the fleet in wartime 1941. The ocean is open. Enemy submarines have not disappeared, and magnetic mines have not been cleared, but the tonnage of merchant ships under the British flag is now greater than before, after a year of unrestricted submarine warfare and eight months of severe mine attacks. (Loud cheers) In addition, we have four million tonnes of merchant ships that have fled to British ports from invaded countries. We have more food reserves of various kinds than in peacetime, and we are undertaking a great program to increase food production.</p>
<p>I make these statements not to boast. The current crisis is still great, but our strengths and resources are more than sufficient to cope. The reason I describe them is so that the nation should know the solid reasons on which our beliefs are based, and the good reasons why we feel that even if we fight alone, even for many years, we can still continue to fight. Because Britain's continued resistance and Germany's continued resistance will rekindle the fire of hope in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people in Europe who have been ravaged, and from this spark, a huge flame will grow to engulf Nazism.</p>
<p>British Air Force is Superior; Blitz Becomes a Dream</p>
<p>The war in the skies over the British Isles has reached a high point in the past few weeks. The size and duration of its scope cannot be predicted at this time, but we must expect the enemy to make even greater attempts than before. The enemy is still setting up airfields in France and the Netherlands, and the transport of troops and weapons for the invasion of Britain is also underway. What is very obvious is that Hitler cannot admit failure in the air war against Britain until he has suffered extremely serious damage. Hitler has boasted so much about how the German side is winning in the air war, how the British side is losing, and how the British are cowering in air-raid shelters and scolding their aristocratic government for mismanaging the country and harming the people. If he does not carry out his air offensive, will his lies not become even more obvious? (Laughter from the audience) Therefore, we can be sure that Hitler will continue to attack as long as he has this ability. As far as the situation in the air war is concerned, the advantage belongs to the British side. I stated in the House of Commons two months ago that in France, British fighter planes often inflicted losses on German planes at a rate of three to one. During the Dunkirk operation, British planes again achieved victories at a rate of one to three or four. Therefore, we expected an even higher ratio in the air war over the British Isles, and that is indeed the case. (Loud cheers) Enemy planes and pilots shot down over the British Isles or in the seas near Britain are either destroyed or captured, while among the British planes and pilots that crash, many have unharmed fuselages and uninjured crew members who can soon rejoin the war.</p>
<p>The Decisive Factor in the War is the Supremacy in the Sky</p>
<p>The measures taken by the Aircraft Production Department to repair damaged aircraft are great and amazing. They can get damaged aircraft back into battle in no time, and quickly supply all kinds of parts and aircraft materials. At the same time, the great increase in the production of British aircraft and engines has led to a daily increase in the number of various aircraft, and the quality has also been improved. Enemy aircraft certainly outnumber British aircraft, but new British production now exceeds German production, and the aircraft produced by the United States are now gradually being shipped to Britain. The strength of British bombers and fighter planes is stronger than at any time. This is a fact that can be seen from daily statistics. We hope and believe that we can continue to engage in air warfare with the enemy for a long time. The longer we continue, the faster our air force can achieve the goal of first being equal to the enemy in number and then gaining supremacy in the sky. The outcome of the war largely depends on whether or not there is supremacy in the sky. British fighter planes have done a commendable job in defeating the enemy, but the work of British bomber squadrons bombing enemy territory night after night should not be forgotten. We can prove the results of British planes bombing military targets in Germany not only from reports from all sides, but also from the photographs taken. The bombing of German military industry, transportation, air bases, and military supply depots will continue on an ever-increasing scale, and may reach a level never dreamed of before within a year. This method will not stop until the end of the war. This is the longest but the surest way to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Discussing the Situation in the Middle East; Unwilling to Predict Trends</p>
<p>What good would it do for the Nazi army to gain victory near the Black Sea or to penetrate deep into the Caspian Sea, or to press directly on the gates of India, if the entire economic and scientific structure of the German war machine were to be broken and shattered at home? The longer we have been able to preserve our army at Dunkirk, the more difficult it will be for the enemy to launch a large-scale invasion of Britain. We have therefore been able to use our maritime supremacy to focus on the Mediterranean and to deal with another enemy who, after stabbing France in the back at a time of hardship, is now our enemy in Africa. France's defection has, of course, greatly damaged Britain's position in the Middle East. Take, for example, the defense of Somaliland. We relied on French troops to attack the Italian army from Djibouti, and also relied on France's naval and air bases in the Mediterranean and on the coast of North Africa. The French navy was also what we relied upon. Even if France proper is temporarily destroyed, there is no reason why the French navy and most of its army and overseas colonies should not fight alongside us. France, with its powerful navy, strategic bases, and ample funds, could still be a major combatant in the struggle. If we were in their shoes, we would fight to the end, and we would, to the best of our ability, arrange for the maritime safety of Canada and other dominions, so that they would have the means to carry on the struggle from overseas. Most of the countries that have been ravaged by Germany are steadfast and unyielding. The people of the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium are still armed and engaged in battle, and the United States and Britain both recognize these fighters as the representative authorities and legitimate governments of their countries. France alone has prostrated itself at this time. This is not the fault of the great and noble French nation, but the fault of a minority in Vichy. We have deep sympathy for the French people. (Loud cheers) The old comradeship between Britain and France has not died. General de Gaulle and his comrades are now demonstrating the Anglo-French relationship in an effective form. These free Frenchmen have been sentenced to death, but their names will eventually be commemorated on stone in the towns and streets of a free and restored France. This is something that will happen in the future, as sure as the rising of the morning sun. However, my belief in the future does not affect the difficulties we are currently facing in the Mediterranean and Africa. British troops have recently withdrawn from Somaliland. There will be even greater battles in the Middle East theater. I am unwilling to predict the trends. We still have many troops in the Middle East, and there are many ways to reinforce them. We have complete naval supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. We must do our best to demonstrate, in a loyal and resolute manner, the duties and responsibilities that are incumbent upon us in the world.</p>
<p>Will Not Lay Down Arms Until the Goals of the War are Achieved</p>
<p>Aside from this, I think the House of Commons does not want me to say anything more, or to ask for a detailed explanation of Britain's war aims, and the kind of post-war peace that Britain desires. I think that the war is still in its early stages, and it would not be wise to make any pronouncements on this matter at a time when the war is raging. However, one aspect that we can see more clearly is that we must think not only for ourselves, but also for our eternal security, and for the principles for which we are fighting, and for the long-term future of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</p>

<p>Rome - An Italian official spokesman said yesterday that after the occupation of Berbera and British Somaliland by Italian troops, they have been able to threaten Britain's Red Sea entrance. At the same time, it was learned that Italy has ordered a blockade of the entire British Empire and Egypt, and has informed all neutral countries that any ships entering the prohibited area "will be immediately destroyed." The message also reiterated the warning of June 15, stating, "The British mainland and its various colonies, dependencies, mandated territories, and areas where British troops are concentrated, such as Egypt, are all dangerous zones within 30 miles of the coast, and navigation along the African coast, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden is particularly dangerous." Italian officials also said, "After Berbera was occupied by our troops, British Somaliland has almost entirely fallen into our hands." Officials hinted that before taking action to attack and close the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, Italy wanted to first seize all important British bases in Northeast Africa, and this victory is the first step in this action. The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait connects the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and is a shortcut from Europe to India, Australia, and New Zealand. (International News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome - Italy has recently followed Germany's lead and announced a tightening of the blockade of British territories, and has notified neutral governments, warning neutral vessels not to enter Italian war zones. The war zone is quite extensive, including the coastal areas of the British territories and protectorates in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Gulf of Aden, and the coasts of the British colonies, Egypt, and Sudan in Africa.

<h3 id="e29">Italy Occupies British Somaliland: Military Strategic Importance; One of the Pillars of the Suez Canal Has Been Broken; British-Indian Sea Lane of Communication Blocked <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Rome: Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland, has now been occupied by Italian forces. Berbera is a natural harbor with a depth of 30 to 60 feet, especially suitable for trade between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Several important highways extend from Berbera into the interior. The city is a center for the trade of colonial products, especially large quantities of ostrich feathers, rubber, hides, and ivory. The annual trade with Aden amounts to 50 million Italian lire. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Local newspapers believe that the occupation of Berbera marks the end of the British Somaliland campaign. Only police action is needed to clear out the remaining British troops. A well-known reporter, Gaida, published an article in the "Italian Daily," stating that British Somaliland has become part of the Italian Empire. The British Navy was only responsible for evacuating troops and military supplies and did not defend Berbera with heavy artillery. One of the pillars of the Suez Canal has been broken. The other pillar, the port of Aden, is only 360 kilometers from the coast of Somaliland and will also be subject to attacks by the Italian air force. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: The French radio station announced that the British withdrawal from British Somaliland is a major victory for Italy. Italy has controlled the Gulf of Aden, which is equivalent to controlling the Gibraltar of the Red Sea. The British communication line with India has been cut off for centuries. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: After the Italian forces occupied British Somaliland, the East African defense line decreased from 4,000 kilometers to 1,100 kilometers. Five British air force bases have fallen into Italian hands. Italy began preparing to attack British Somaliland after joining the war on June 10. On the 15th of this month, the Italian air force began attacking British air force bases, bombing Port Sudan six times, Aden eight times, Moyale twice, Djibouti twice, Bobeira six times, Berbera five times, Zeila twice, and Akobo and Wajir several times. Italian forces occupied Gallabat and Kassala on July 4, Kojak and Jessa near Moyale on July 17, and Kojak on July 31. On the 5th of this month, they began attacking British Somaliland. The war zone is between 50 and 60 square kilometers. The Italian forces attacked in three directions: the first towards Zeila, occupying it on the 8th; the second towards Hargeisa, occupying it on the 9th; and the third occupying Usna on the 10th. After the Italian forces occupied the Kaling and Godetala passes between Hargeisa and Berbera, they advanced to the first line of British defense. The Italian forces occupied Adenle on the 12th, and the first line of defense was breached with the occupation of Jerrato. On the 19th, the Italian forces broke through the second line of British defense, which included machine gun and artillery positions, as well as concrete trenches and barbed wire. The total number of British troops was 40,000, while the number of Italian troops has not been announced. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)</p>

The railway is 800 kilometers long. After Italy occupied Abyssinia, due to France's control of the port, freight volume was low, only 80,000 tons per year. Currently, Italy has added four motor locomotives and six steam locomotives to increase the railway's transportation capacity. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e32">German Aircraft Active Over Britain: Heavy Bombing on the Southeast Coast; British Aircraft Successfully Attack German Military Areas <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>London: After two very quiet days over Britain, this morning was once again filled with activity, as German aircraft continued to launch large-scale attacks on cities in the northeast and southeast of England, the Midlands, and coastal areas of Wales. However, German aircraft were quickly repelled by British fighter planes in all areas. One German aircraft flew low over a suburb of a city in the Midlands, bombing and destroying several shops and houses, causing some deaths and injuries, including children. Another German aircraft strafed a busy city on the coast this morning, but fortunately, there were no casualties. A city in the southeast heard the whirring of aircraft in the clouds, but no aircraft were seen, and the sound of a major explosion was heard in the distance, likely caused by a high-explosive bomb. It was reported that a German aircraft near the coast was pursued and shot down by a British Spitfire fighter. According to a joint announcement by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security, German aircraft bombed a city in southeastern England this morning, with several bombs falling in a park. Several houses near the train station were also destroyed, and several people were injured. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, enemy aircraft approached the southeast coast of England in batches, resulting in a fierce battle that lasted for two hours. The outcome is still unknown. A squadron of twenty enemy bombers was forced to change course by fierce anti-aircraft fire. The second squadron of enemy aircraft was also repelled, and their escort fighters failed to attack the barrage balloons and were driven out to sea by British fighters. An airfield on the southeast coast was attacked by enemy dive bombers and sustained only minor damage before the enemy aircraft were repelled. According to a communiqué from the Ministry of Aviation, British bombers conducted daytime reconnaissance over the Netherlands and the North Sea, bombing an anti-aircraft gun position near Amsterdam and the Flugging airfield. One British aircraft did not return. Last night, British aircraft attacked thirty enemy airfields in Germany and enemy-occupied areas, bombed the Kiel naval base in Germany, the oil refinery in Hanover, the power station north of Leipzig, key enemy transportation lines in the Ruhr area and northwestern Germany, and oil tanks near Bordeaux. Two British aircraft were lost. According to a communiqué from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security, on Tuesday morning, there was less enemy aircraft activity over Britain. Cities in Essex and South Wales were bombed, with bombs hitting houses, injuring several people, and few fatalities. A port in South Wales was also hit, with minor damage. Yesterday afternoon, large formations of enemy aircraft approached the southeast coast. A town in East Anglia was bombed, with no deaths or injuries, and material damage was limited to shattered windows. The main target of the enemy aircraft's attack yesterday afternoon appeared to be an airfield on the south coast, but the enemy aircraft seemed unable to achieve their attack objectives, so very few enemy aircraft penetrated British defenses, and there was no material damage. Yesterday, a city in the southwest was bombed, killing and injuring several people. In another city in the southwest, a German aircraft flew in, swooped down, and strafed people swimming on the beach, then ascended and strafed the local militia stationed on the cliff top. A British fighter aircraft flew in to intercept it, and the German aircraft fled into the clouds. According to incomplete reports, three enemy aircraft were shot down by British fighters yesterday, and one was shot down by the Polish Air Force squadron of the British Air Force. The Ministry of Aviation announced that it has now been confirmed that another eight enemy aircraft were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire on Sunday. On Sunday night, a German seaplane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire off the northeast coast of England. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chengdu, August 20 (Dispatch): The eighth annual meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the School of Law of Sichuan University in Emei. The meeting hall was meticulously decorated. More than 200 members and guests attended the meeting. Wu Baluo, the president of the society, was unable to attend due to transportation difficulties. Zhang Hongyuan, director of the board and chairman of the organizing committee, presided over the meeting. Dai Anbang, director and deputy president, gave a speech. The conference received dozens of congratulatory messages. The instructions and encouragement from the president of the Central Bank, and Ministers Chen and Weng of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economy, respectively, were particularly earnest. The President's instructions stated that under the current situation in our country, whether from the perspective of people's livelihood or national defense, the development of science, especially the field of chemistry, is a pressing matter. He also stated that the success or failure of the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction in the future will be the responsibility of our academic community. When the national foundation is consolidated and the country reveres virtue and rewards merit, our academic community will occupy the most glorious position, bringing welfare to the people and creating peace for all generations. This is the ambition and duty of all of you. Cheng Tianfang, the president of Sichuan University, gave a welcoming speech to the conference and hosted a public banquet for all members at Baoguo Temple in the afternoon. More than 100 papers were presented on the morning of the 20th. In addition, there were several important proposals. The conference schedule is five days in total. After the closing, an inspection group will be organized to visit Chengdu, Jiading and other places to inspect the chemical industry. (August 21 Dispatch)</p>

In an attempt to struggle, they gathered a unit on the morning of the 18th, first bombarded fiercely with artillery fire, and then launched an infantry attack towards Nalan, Nabi, Bancheng and other places.

<p>Chongqing: Around noon today, it was reported that four batches of Japanese aircraft had flown into Sichuan Province, and an alarm was issued. However, the Japanese aircraft did not arrive, and the alarm was lifted at 1:30 PM. "It is reported that the Japanese aircraft flew into Sichuan from southern Shanxi and bombed several small villages about 150 miles west of Chongqing." It is heard that Japanese bombers have been protected by fighter planes in the past two days, which has never been seen before. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Japanese army is now using the Yichang airfield to send fighter planes to protect their bombers. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Most of the city of Chongqing was destroyed, and 40,000 homeless people began their evacuation at dawn today. When the usual air raid alarm sounded again at noon, residents had to take shelter in trenches. However, the wartime capital was not attacked today, and Japanese aircraft were not seen during the two-hour alarm. According to the Chinese side, a small group of Japanese aircraft was discovered in Shunqing, 90 miles north of Chongqing. It was also claimed that a Japanese bomber was shot down on August 11 in Shizhu, 80 miles east of Chongqing, and four of the eight crew members were captured alive. According to official estimates, 10,000 people were displaced by the air raid yesterday, and they spent the night in the areas bombed by Japanese aircraft. The United Press reporter investigated the area again this afternoon and saw a group of people from the city gazing at the rubble, as if on a tour. All the people in the city have already moved to the countryside, and only a few have taken their belongings with them. The great fire yesterday was extinguished at dawn today, but wisps of smoke continued to rise. Many Chinese people here say that the ancient city of Chongqing has virtually disappeared from the map. The printing houses of the Xinmin Daily and the Central Daily News were burned down in the past two days, but the Xinmin Daily continued to publish today. The newspaper stated that Japan is imitating Germany in attempting to force the Chinese to surrender with an aerial blitzkrieg, but the morale of the Chinese people has been strengthened as a result. Germany can mobilize 2,000 aircraft at a time, but this Eastern imitator has sent less than 200 naval and air aircraft. The Chinese people should remember the words of Chairman Chiang, "Even if the National Government is in a pile of rubble, it will continue to administer as usual. We can only respond to the enemy's bombing with an even stronger determination." (August 21, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Kang Xinru, the speaker of the Chongqing Municipal Council, made a statement regarding the Japanese air raid on Chongqing, saying that Japanese aircraft are attacking Chongqing day and night, dropping large amounts of bombs or incendiary bombs, with the aim of slaughtering our unarmed civilians. According to the Japanese military spokesman in Hankou, Chongqing has been attacked 38 times in three months, with 3,300 aircraft sorties and 2,500 tons of bombs dropped. The lives and property of our Chongqing citizens will certainly suffer some sacrifice, but their strong and unyielding will to resist will not be shaken by the threat of Japanese aircraft, and will only strengthen our hatred of the enemy. We firmly believe that Chongqing will not be reduced to ruins. Even if it becomes ruins, we are determined to rebuild the glory of the future. We firmly believe that Chongqing is unconquerable, as is the rest of China. The Japanese will never achieve their goal of subjugating us unless they abandon their brutal acts, and they will only reap endless evil consequences. The close cooperation between the air defense department in providing relief to citizens and the government's timely and effective collaboration in displaying the great compassion of rescuing the dying and healing the wounded is enough to reassure our compatriots across the country and international friends. As for the homeless, we will do our best to appeal to the government and people from all walks of life to provide extensive relief. (August 21 Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Principles for Adjusting Court Personnel Established <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: In order to adjust the number of personnel in courts and prisons and adapt to the complexity of affairs, the Judicial Yuan has formulated three principles for thoroughly adjusting and replenishing court personnel: (1) Regarding prosecutors and clerks, each judge or prosecutor must be assigned a recording clerk. In addition, a number of clerks are established to handle registration and administrative affairs. (2) Regarding accounting and statistics, a separate accounting system is being implemented. Accounting and statistics for judicial organs are particularly important. Therefore, accounting officers and statisticians are specially established in high courts, high branch courts, and local courts with more complex affairs. A new type A prison will also specially establish an accounting officer to emphasize accounting administration. (3) Regarding bailiffs, law enforcement officers, and guards, the jurisdictions of the first and second-level courts in various provinces are very broad, but the number of bailiffs and law enforcement officers is generally small and should be increased appropriately for distribution. As for prison guards, the standard is one guard for every ten prisoners, and one chief guard for every ten guards. (August 21 Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Chinese and Foreigners Enthusiastically Bid Farewell: 300 British Troops Left Shanghai Yesterday; More Than 100 British Troops from Tianjin Arrived Here Yesterday; British Troops Requisition Five Ships to Set Sail One After Another <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>A portion of the British troops ordered to withdraw finally made their move yesterday. Shortly after noon yesterday, cheers were endless along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road, as large numbers of Western residents were bidding farewell to detachments of the British East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment. The scene at that time was reminiscent of the grand occasion when British troops first arrived here in 1927. Comparing the two, they were exactly the same. As they departed, the soldiers also cheered loudly along the way to respond to those who were bidding farewell.</p>
<p>Column Moves East with Motorcycle Escort</p>
<p>Those who made the most affectionate farewell to the people of Shanghai yesterday totaled 300. They departed from the British barracks on Great West Road, marched in formation into Hongkou, and boarded the Desheng Wheel steamer bound for Hong Kong. The British troops marched in columns of three abreast. At the start, four motorcycles led the way, one of which belonged to the US Navy Fourth Regiment. This was followed by the US Navy Fourth Regiment's band of about 30 people, led by Mr. Keifen. Among the departing British troops, the East Surrey Regiment was in the front row, followed by the West Yorkshire Regiment's band, and finally the West Yorkshire Regiment detachment.</p>
<p>Parting Sentiments Movingly Touch Hearts</p>
<p>When the British troops passed through Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road, the band played farewell songs, which were moving and emotional. Residents nearby came out to watch, and the sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians, and traffic was temporarily cut off. British and American expatriates waved handkerchiefs and nodded as the column passed, and the soldiers also raised their hands in salute and shouted "Goodbye." Those living in tall buildings also leaned out of the windows, watching and calling out, and some were even filled with tears, following the column with reluctance. The parting sentiments were movingly touching hearts. Photographers with mirror-box cameras also crisscrossed the area. Patrolmen were reinforced along the Bund, and peddlers and beggars had disappeared.</p>
<p>American Troops Play Music to See Them Off</p>
<p>When the column turned from Nanjing Road to the Bund and reached the gate of the British Consulate General, the American military band withdrew from the column, lined up on the side of the road, and began to play farewell music to say goodbye to the British troops. When the British troops passed over the Garden Bridge, the White Russian detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, who were taking over the defense, all raised their guns in salute. The British troops also paid attention and returned the salute. A team of Japanese naval marines was also at the foot of the bridge, saluting the British troops. The British troops continued to advance along Broadway Road to the Gonghexing Wharf and boarded the Desheng Wheel steamer moored there. Their military luggage had already been moved on board the previous day.</p>
<p>British Troops from Tianjin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of British troops stationed in China, the British military authorities requisitioned five vessels from Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., namely the Yong Sheng, Hao Sheng, Yi Sheng, and De Sheng, as well as the Great Britain Company's Tanda. The Tanda is returning to Shanghai from Japan today and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai with British troops on the 26th. The De Sheng, carrying 160 British troops stationed in Tianjin, arrived in Shanghai at around 11:00 AM yesterday. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, and the British troops disembarked at 2:00 PM. The ship moved from the Roosevelt Wharf to the Yangshupu pontoon at 4:45 PM yesterday (customs time) and anchored. After the British troops returned to the ship, it was scheduled to weigh anchor and depart in the morning.</p>
<p>Yi Sheng Ship Sailed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Yi Sheng moved from the Roosevelt pontoon to the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou the day before yesterday. After the British troops boarded the ship yesterday afternoon, it departed at 4:30 PM and sailed south from the Wusongkou at 6:30 PM. The Yong Sheng arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last Monday and was requisitioned to transport troops. It was then docked for painting. It is reported that it will be completed and leave the dock today and is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. As soon as the British troops board the ship, it will leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hao Sheng Repairs Will Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>The Hao Sheng weighs more than 5,600 tons and originally sailed on the Nanyang Singapore and Japan routes. It was also requisitioned to transport troops this time, so after arriving in port last week, it was anchored at pontoons 24 and 25, where it was painted day and night, and the work will be completed soon, awaiting the British troops to board the ship, then it will weigh anchor and depart. It is reported that each vessel will stop briefly in Hong Kong before heading straight to Singapore. The four Jardine Matheson vessels were requisitioned to carry troops, so the cabins were all freshly painted, and the dining halls were also renovated, at a huge cost.</p>

<p>The American Eastern Banking Corporation, which is currently in liquidation, will repay the second batch of old debts, amounting to one-tenth, to its creditors, who are classified as "Class B" by the US Consular Court in China.</p>
<p>Calculated at the Current Exchange Rate</p>
<p>This amounts to approximately 1,050,000 yuan in legal tender. More than 900 checks are required. The issue date for the checks is August 20 of this year, and they can be cashed at the Bank of Communications at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. 500 of the checks were mailed to creditors in Shanghai on August 19, and the rest were mailed on the 20th. It is noted that in April 1937, the American Eastern Banking Corporation used</p>
<p>The First Batch of Old Debts</p>
<p>Amounting to two-tenths, to repay "Class B" creditors. Together with this second batch of old debts, this is three-tenths. At that time, the liquidator of the American Eastern Banking Corporation also repaid the old debts of "Class A" creditors in full, after deducting 8% of the liquidation fees payable by the creditors. The repayment of old debts to "Class B" creditors, or those issued today, is the last batch, but there is still a</p>
<p>Possibility of Continuing to Repay a Small Amount</p>

Regarding the liquidation of the American and Foreign Bank, it is noted that the liquidator of the bank once used 37.5% of the old debts to repay depositors and other creditors. The sixth batch of old debts, amounting to 5%, was repaid in September of last year. It is expected that the bank will soon use the last batch of small old debts to repay depositors and other creditors.</p>

<h3 id="e46">### Great China Evening News Reporter Cheng Zhenzhang Passed Away Yesterday, Condition Worsened Last Night and Finally Succumbed, Elderly Mother Was Present and Fainted <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Zhenzhang, a reporter for the Great China Evening News, left his home for the office at around 9 a.m. on the 19th. While walking on Avenue Road, two people suddenly jumped out of a car parked on the side of the road, pulled out handguns, and fired two shots at him. One bullet hit his mouth, and the other hit his abdomen. The assailants fled without a trace. He was later taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment in a police car. At that time, there was little bleeding, and he was in good health. After the doctors did their best to perform surgery, his condition seemed good. After a blood transfusion the day before, his condition suddenly worsened, his temperature rose, and he became unconscious. After administering a cardiac injection, he gradually calmed down. By yesterday afternoon, his temperature had risen to over 40 degrees Celsius, and his pulse was 150 beats per minute. At around 6 p.m., he suddenly jumped out of bed, shouting that something was unfinished and he had to take care of it personally. The doctor forcibly held him down and repeatedly comforted him, but his agitation did not subside. At 8:05 p.m., he suddenly passed away. His elderly mother was present and, upon seeing this, was heartbroken and fainted once. She was revived by the hospital staff, who strongly advised her to go home. Currently, the funeral arrangements are being handled by the newspaper. The body was sent to the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 9 p.m. last night, and the funeral date will be chosen later. Mr. Cheng was only 30 years old, unmarried, and lived with his elderly mother, relying on each other. Besides her, he had no close relatives. His sudden and tragic death has caused grief among all who have heard of it.</p>
<h3 id="e47">British Troops' Abandoned Defense Areas Taken Over by Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Area North of Suzhou Creek Assigned to A Company, Central Area Assigned to White Russian Unit <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The British troops' defense area in the western Hongkou district of the International Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek (i.e., the area from North Henan Road to North Xizang Road) was originally scheduled to be taken over by the White Russian Unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps starting at 8 p.m. on the 20th. However, according to inquiries made by a Pingming News Agency reporter with relevant parties, the Japanese side actually opposed the White Russian Unit taking over the western Hongkou district and insisted that the area be taken over by the British Unit. At the same time, they also opposed the other units in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps taking over. Therefore, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander Hampeh summoned A Company at 8 p.m. the night before, and the takeover was completed at 10 p.m. It is understood that A Company consists of volunteer members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, who all have other professions, unlike the White Russian Unit, which is a formally trained army unit. Currently, the central area of the International Settlement, such as the area from the Bund to Yu Qiaqing Road, is still defended by the White Russian Unit.</p>
<p>British Unit Organization</p>
<p>A Company is a British unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The Jewish Unit is also incorporated into this company, but it was not included in the call-up the night before to take over the area north of the Suzhou Creek. The A Company's British members include over 90 in A Platoon, over 80 in B Platoon, 70 in the Scottish Unit, and over 60 in the British Machine Gun Unit (i.e., the anti-aircraft unit), for a total of over 300 including officers. According to the quota, each platoon should have 120 people, so there is a considerable shortage.</p>
<p>Six Areas Taken Over. A Company took over the British troops' defense areas at 10 p.m. the night before, totaling six areas: 1. The intersection of Boundary Road and Baoshan Road; 2. The Qianjiang Guild Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road; 3. The First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road; 4. The Dry Bridge Entrance on North Zhejiang Road; 5. The iron gate at the border of the Concession on Kaifeng Road; 6. The vicinity of the pseudo "Central Market" on North Xizang Road. Among the British barracks, the First Special District Court serves as the headquarters of A Company.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Denies Stationing Troops in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, at a reception for Western newspaper reporters, a Japanese naval spokesman denied reports that Japanese naval landing forces had stationed troops in the western Shanghai defense area. The spokesman said that any Japanese troops seen in the area were soldiers going to guard Japanese-owned textile mills. When reporters asked whether patrol duties in the western Shanghai area would be taken over by the navy or the army, the spokesman replied that he had not yet received reports on this issue, and the date on which Japanese troops would be stationed in the area had not yet been decided. The spokesman also said that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai were unaware of any discussions taking place between the United States and Japan regarding the Shanghai defense area, but this did not mean that such discussions did not exist.</p>

<p>The tribute rice ordered at the beginning of this month has been shipped to Shanghai in succession. Shipments have been arriving daily recently. It is reported that from January to June this year, a total of 1,875,269 piculs of foreign rice were shipped to Shanghai (each picul is 160 city pounds; two piculs is one bag; each bag is one dan two dou and a half), worth 3,487,636 national currency. Among them, Annam accounted for the largest share, with 1,135,106 piculs, followed by Siam with 541,970 piculs, and Burma third with 181,376 piculs. According to the current daily rice consumption in Shanghai, calculated at 9,000 dan, the supply is indeed very abundant. Yesterday's fair price sales were extremely crowded, and rice prices in various shops fell by about 6 jiao.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Jinhua received yesterday by Zhejiang groups in Shanghai, at 7:58 a.m. on the 20th, two Japanese planes were spotted in Xushan, flying from northeast to southwest. The Japanese planes then passed over Yuyao, Xikou, and Xinchang, circling once over Xinchang before entering the airspace of Shengxian. After circling, they dropped two bombs, one landing in the Qiantang River and the other in a field. They then flew to Changle and dropped six bombs, causing destruction before heading east towards Dongyang, Shaoxing, and Baiguan before heading out to sea.</p>
<p>Bombing of Wulishan</p>
<p>Also, at 8 a.m. the day before, two Japanese planes appeared, flying from east to south. They circled three times over Zhuji before entering the airspace of Yiwu, circling twice, and then entering the airspace of Jinhua, circling for a long time. They also blindly dropped thirteen bombs on Wulishan in Jinhua, causing no damage. At 1:23 p.m., a Japanese plane was also spotted over Yuhuan, then flew towards Wenling, Haimen, Ninghai, Fenghua, Xikou, and Guanhaiwei before heading out to sea.</p>
<p>Shelling of Zhenhai</p>
<p>Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port suddenly opened fire again the day before, shelling the Zhenhai fortress. It was found that the Japanese warships opened fire at 7:40 a.m. A Japanese warship sailed from the Lichang waters to Zhenhai Port and suddenly fired eleven shots at the south bank of the Yangtze River without any target. The shells all landed in the sand, causing no damage. After opening fire, the Japanese warship still sailed to the Lichang waters and anchored there. It had not left by yesterday morning. It is reported that the defending forces are currently monitoring it.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of third-country shipping on the Shanghai-Fujian route, Mr. Zhang Zhonghe, the Chinese manager of the British-owned Yilong Company, told Pingming News Agency reporters yesterday that there is little hope of resumption in the near future. The company's authorities' negotiations with the Japanese side through the British Consulate have not yielded any results. Rumors that the Jianghai Customs has allowed Fuqing in Fujian Province to clear customs, revealing a glimmer of hope for the Shanghai-Fujian shipping route, are actually premature. Furthermore, rumors that the company's Shenai Wheel has sailed to Yantai to seek other developments are also untrue. The wheel is still staying in Shanghai. All of the company's ships are stranded in Shanghai awaiting orders and are not currently considering changing to other routes. He also said that because the matter concerns business, we have no choice but to argue for the resumption of navigation based on reason.</p>
<p>Shenhua Aftermath</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Yilong Company's Shenhua Wheel being robbed, the opinions of the robbed passengers and the company are still quite divergent. Pingming News Agency reporters separately inquired with the Yilong Company authorities and the Fujian Provincial Association yesterday. The Fujian passengers who were robbed, in addition to asking the association to make four demands to Yilong, also stated yesterday that if these demands are not accepted by Yilong, they will not hesitate to resort to the law. It is also learned that these four demands were sent to the company by the Relief Committee this morning, and the results will be discussed at the association's executive meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p>Yilong's Attitude</p>
<p>However, the Yilong Company authorities stated that they have no obligation to fulfill these conditions. According to the Chinese manager of the company, they will naturally agree to the clause that "once navigation is smooth, the company's first ship should first carry the passengers who were robbed this time back to Fujian free of charge," and they are also very sympathetic to allocating funds to relieve the robbed passengers. However, if this matter is raised as a responsibility-style condition and for compensation for losses, etc., then it seems that there is no obligation to fulfill it.</p>
<p>Xijiang Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to news from the French Postal Ship Company yesterday, the company's Xijiang Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Kobe, Japan, at about 10 a.m. yesterday and moored at buoys 14 and 15. Because the wheel brought many passengers and goods from Kobe, it was originally scheduled to sail eastward tonight but has been postponed to 8 a.m. on the 24th and will sail directly to Haiphong without stopping at ports. According to the company, there were not many passengers on this voyage, which is presumably due to the current situation. However, there were many goods and cargo being transported.</p>
<p>Small Wheel Sails to Songmen</p>
<p>The German-owned Huilinyang Company's Gaodeng Wheel has decided to sail to Songmen and other places in the Zhejiang sea mouth on the 24th of this month. Yesterday, the vessels sailing to Songmen included the Yian Foreign Company's Lima Wheel and Liping Wheel, which sailed to Songmen on the 19th. There is no news of their arrival yet. Both of these wheels are less than 50 tons, with very small hulls and small capacity, and cannot carry cargo.</p>
<p>Gulu Bombed</p>
<p>When Japanese planes bombed Gutoutou on the 8th of this month, there were a total of three Japanese planes. After reconnoitering over Bijiang Town and Pingyang County, they flew towards Ruian. Then, they returned and dropped a bomb in the bamboo forest under Fangyan across the river from Gutoutou, destroying one thatched house and more than 200 bamboo poles, killing two civilians and injuring one woman. Afterwards, they flew to the Bijiang Lingxipu Riverbank and dropped a bomb and strafed with machine guns, killing six people, injuring eight, and sinking five civilian boats and one sailboat, and damaging six civilian boats.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Attacked</p>
<p>Wenzhou was bombed by Japanese planes on the 11th of this month, with a total of nine bombs dropped. It is said that bombs fell in the vicinity of the New Pier, four bombs fell on Paotai Island, and one 100-pound bomb fell on Futoumen, with unknown losses.</p>

<p>At the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Muriel at around 8:45 a.m. yesterday, a failed kidnapping occurred. The victim was Kong Xianfen, who was fortunate to avoid danger due to his own alertness and loud cries for help. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>One Bandit Stops Car, Attempts Kidnapping</p>
<p>Kong Xianfen, styled Songsheng, is 43 years old and lives at No. 6, Lane 75, Route Muriel. At around 8:45 a.m. yesterday, Kong left his residence in a chartered car to run errands. As soon as the car left the lane, after traveling for dozens of steps to the vicinity of the Fuxiang Lumber Company at the corner of Route Muriel and Avenue Joffre, a bandit suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and stopped the car. At the same time, he attempted to drag Kong out of the car and force him into a car that had been lying in wait there.</p>
<p>Struggles Vigorously, Fortunately Escapes Danger</p>
<p>At this time, Kong saw that the situation was not good and immediately struggled vigorously and shouted for help. The chauffeur was also anxious and shouted. The bandit, fearing that the police stationed at Avenue Joffre would be unfavorable to him, abandoned Kong and fled, jumping into a bandit car on the side of the road and driving away quickly, disappearing without a trace. Kong saw that the bandit car had left and immediately had the chauffeur report the attempted kidnapping to the nearby police. A revolver was found nearby, and a suspect was apprehended together with the client and taken to the police station. After the police chief reported the incident, he urgently ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. On the one hand, they were pursuing the bandits based on the client's description of the bandits' appearance and clothing. However, the number plate of the bandit car could not be recalled on the spot. The police are currently investigating.</p>

Therefore, the results were very satisfactory. This special letter is sent to express thanks and for your information.</p>

<h3 id="e54">French Concession Rent Committee Convenes Second General Meeting, Chinese Language Group Discussed Disputes between Second Landlords and Third Tenants the Day Before <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Rent Investigation Committee is scheduled to convene its second plenary meeting in early next month. At that time, French Consul General Oren and members of the committee's various subcommittees will attend. Pingming News Agency reporters learned from the committee's secretariat yesterday that the secretariat has distributed notices of the convocation of the second general meeting to the Chinese, French, and English subcommittees, urging them to quickly sort out the various materials recently collected in order to provide a basis for research and discussion when the general meeting is held.</p>
<p>Chinese Language Group Holds Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Furthermore, the first and second groups of the committee's Chinese language group held their fourth joint meeting at 8 p.m. the day before at the French Concession Taxpayer Association. The attendees included Chairman Lan Xuzhang, Committee Members Zhu Wende, Xu Jashi, and Wang Runniu, totaling five people. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Dai, who had previously submitted opinions to the committee, were also invited to attend. Their statements were roughly as follows: Rent disputes often occur between second landlords and third tenants. The reason for this is that second landlords often take advantage of the special situation of Shanghai being overcrowded and impose various unduly harsh conditions on third tenants, such as using fixed-term leases to evict tenants who have reached the end of their term, increasing rents without end, and unreasonably restricting the use of water and electricity. All of these methods are used to the extreme. In short, second landlords often use their superior position to seek excessive profits, resulting in endless disputes and affecting public order. The Rent Committee should find ways to adjust this. After discussion, the subcommittee agreed to accept these opinions as a reference for promoting its work.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Chief Nurse's Sudden Death Case, Perjury Portion of Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 28th <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Li Wangying, also known as Jie Ru, a woman from Pingtan, Fujian, who was the chief nurse at the Zhongxi Sanatorium at No. 536 Bushi Road, was 31 years old this year. She had worked at the hospital for nine years and remained single. On the Dragon Boat Festival on June 10 of this year, she went home to visit her family and then returned to the hospital to sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. the next morning, her nephew Li Konglan came to the hospital to ask his aunt for an injection, but Li Yuying was already lying stiff in bed, her body cold. She had been dead for a long time. Lu Zhenqing (from Beiping, 39 years old this year, son of the hospital's director Lu Zhong'an), the hospital's administrator, notified the Chinese Funeral Home to transport the body to the funeral home for embalming. Afterwards, he ordered Dr. Lin Zhengliang (38 years old, from Ningbo) to issue a death certificate stating that Li Yuying died of a stroke, without reporting to the police station in accordance with the regulations of concession hospitals. Just as the coffin was about to be buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery, someone using the pseudonym Lei Huayun separately sent letters to the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, the Second Special Court, and the French Police Department, reporting that Li Yuying's death was unclear and requesting an investigation and prosecution. Subsequently, Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, investigated Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang and believed that they were indeed suspected, and filed a public prosecution with this court on charges of fabricating evidence. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, the case was tried by Judge Zhu Chuzhe with Prosecutor Zhao at the Second Criminal Court. First, according to Lin Zhengliang's statement, he graduated from the medical department of St. John's University and had been working as a doctor in Shanghai sanatoriums. He transferred to Zhongxi Hospital before July. Perhaps I was not in the hospital at the time of death. I arrived at the hospital in the afternoon and learned that the deceased had been sent to the funeral home. I only issued a certificate of death from stroke on the 14th, because I had treated the deceased's illness and given her eight injections before she died. Therefore, according to my academic observations, perhaps she died of a stroke. However, it was not Lu who forced me to issue it. The court immediately questioned him: Why did you say that Mu Ming'er issued it during the investigation last time, and now you suddenly changed your testimony? Lin hesitated. According to Lu Zhenqing's statement, my father is the executive director of Zhongxi Hospital. I was appointed by the board of directors as the director of the hospital and sent to assist my father in managing the hospital affairs. I graduated from Beiping Medical University. On the day of the deceased's death, I originally intended to report to the police station, but the deceased's parents did not want an autopsy, so I notified the funeral home to embalm the body and had Dr. Lin issue a certificate. The court, believing that the case was clear, ordered the same debate. Prosecutor Zhao then stood up and prosecuted Lu Zhenqing for the crime of instigating others to fabricate evidence, and Lin Zhengliang for the crime of fabricating evidence. The two defendants commissioned lawyers Ling Changyan and Shan Yuhua to defend them. The court hearing scheduled the verdict for the 28th. The two defendants were released on their original bail.</p>

<p>The Sentai Money Shop at No. 517 Sichuan Road was established by Zhang Taihe. He originally employed Huo Ganquan as an accountant. Recently, Zhang discovered that Huo frequented dance halls and spent money lavishly, so he was very suspicious. Therefore, he recently hired Yan Zhurong from Zhenjiang as an accountant to supervise him. After Yan took over, he immediately discovered that Huo had embezzled thousands of yuan in funds. At Huo's request, he did not report it. Later, when the owner checked the accounts, Huo returned the embezzled funds in full, so it was not exposed. On the 4th of this month, Huo begged Yan again, saying that he planned to engage in speculation and borrowed a large sum of money. Yan actually lent him a total of 17,500 yuan in cash and US dollar bills. A few days ago, Zhang Taihe suddenly ordered the accounts to be cleared again. Huo was unable to repay the money in time and fled. After Zhang found out, he reported it to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Han Shouyou, Yan was detained for aiding and abetting embezzlement. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baozhen requested that he be temporarily detained as further investigation was required. After questioning by Judge Xiao, he ordered him to be detained pending rescheduling of the trial.</p>

<p>Ni Ahu, a 19-year-old apprentice carpenter from Pudong at the Shuntai Construction Company located at 631 Julu Road in the French Concession, had a poor reputation and often stole items from his colleagues, leading to his being looked down upon. Recently, Cai Binglang (40 years old), a cook from Chongming working for the same company, discovered that Ni was responsible for the theft of some items within the company. He reported this to the accounting department the day before yesterday afternoon, resulting in Ni's reprimand and dismissal. As Ni was unable to return home immediately, he was allowed to stay at the company temporarily. Unexpectedly, Ni became deeply unhappy due to his dismissal, causing him to toss and turn in bed at night. Cai, who shared the room with him, noticed his restlessness and suspected him of further misconduct. He accused Ni of stealing again. Ni, being young and impulsive, took a sharp axe around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, while Cai was still asleep, and struck Cai violently on the head, killing him instantly. After the incident, Ni fled to 528 Avenue Joffre, where he was eventually apprehended. He is currently in police custody for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Qinghua Agricultural Research Institute: Plant Physiology Group's Work, and Manufacturing Applied Chemistry Instruments to Meet Urgent Needs <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Kunming News) The main work of the Plant Physiology Group at the National Qinghua University Agricultural Research Institute originally focused on physiology. Due to the war, it has temporarily also been researching applied biology problems. The following is a summary of the group's recent work over the past year and a half:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Practical Issues</p>
<p>(1) Utilization of Vegetable Oils: Extraction and utilization of castor oil, tung oil, and turpentine, led by Tang Peisong and others. Yunnan castor oil, after appropriate treatment, can be used as a lubricating oil for machines, trains, cars, and airplanes. Tung oil can be used to make candles and shoe polish, and can also replace paraffin wax for making biological sections. A special article has been published in the American Stain Technology magazine. The candle-making process has obtained a patent from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Furthermore, research on tung trees and tung oil has received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. By applying chemicals to tung branches, roots can be generated in a short period.</p>
<p>(2) Utilization of Plant Growth Hormones: The group can be considered a pioneer in the research and utilization of growth hormones in China. Science contains Hu Dujing's research report on eight economic plants (privet, ash, kapok, etc.). According to the report, plants treated with growth hormones all develop roots quickly.</p>
<p>(3) Using Chemical Methods to Produce Polyploid Plants: Using the chemical action of colchicine to increase the number of chromosomes in plant cells, transforming them into polyploid plants. This is a new discovery in genetics and breeding in the last two or three years. The group is currently collaborating with the Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute to focus on large-scale polyploid plant breeding research, especially focusing on the breeding and improvement of rice, wheat, barley, oats, and legumes.</p>
<p>(4) Applied Chemistry Work: 1. Synthesis of plant growth hormones. Due to wartime equipment limitations, production is limited. Plans are underway to scale up production to meet demand. 2. Production of anhydrous pure alcohol. Previously, approximately 30 gallons were produced, which was used by various biology departments in the country for experiments.</p>
<p>(5) Instrument Manufacturing: The institute has a workshop for manufacturing various metal instruments, wooden products, and blown glass products.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Physiological Issues</p>
<p>(1) Experiments on Plant Stimulus Conduction: Using electrical principles and instruments to explore the physical mechanisms of plant stimulus conduction.</p>
<p>(2) Research on National Nutrition: The group is currently collaborating with the Red Cross Rescue Headquarters to investigate and improve the diet and nutrition of Chinese soldiers. It is also planning to promote rational food types and production for the military and the entire country.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting Plant Development: Using physical methods such as temperature and chemical agents and growth hormones to shorten the maturity of plants.</p>
<p>(4) Cell Respiration: Tang Peisong has conducted research on seed respiration. Recently, he published an article in the Annual Review of Biology reviewing cell respiration in recent years, discussing this issue in detail.</p>

<p>There is a major unresolved issue in Chinese language education: elementary school students are accustomed to learning vernacular Chinese, but when they enter junior high school, they suddenly have to learn literary Chinese, which they find difficult to understand. This is due to the lack of a literary Chinese foundation in elementary school. To solve this problem, Beixin Bookstore has specially invited Zhao Jingshen to create "An Introduction to Literary Chinese" as a supplementary textbook for elementary school. It consists of four volumes, one for each semester, each priced at two and a half jiao. It includes translations between literary and vernacular Chinese and includes grammar lessons to demonstrate methods of understanding. The selected texts are also short and easy to understand. It is reported that many schools have already adopted it.</p>

<h3 id="e69">School News Roundup <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Guoqiang Middle School: Since its establishment, Guoqiang Middle School has followed the educational spirit of Nanyang Middle School for decades. Among the 185 applicants for this year's enrollment, 32 were denied participation in the entrance exam due to their unkempt appearance or frivolous behavior. In the end, only 36 were admitted. The school authorities were displeased with the poor performance of the examinees. It is rumored that another enrollment exam will be held on August 30th, but students with poor academic or behavioral records are discouraged from applying.</p>
<p>Sanlin Commercial Vocational School: Sanlin Commercial Vocational School and Elementary School have been located in the Pudong countryside for more than forty years. The school has a simple academic atmosphere and strict discipline. Even after moving to Shanghai, the school has remained unaffected by the superficial environment. The school board believes that living is currently difficult and that in order to reduce the burden on students' families and maintain low tuition fees, they are raising funds to make up for the shortfall. It is reported that the school will re-select teachers this semester, with new hires including commercial teachers Zhu Gongyan and Wu Mingxin, English teacher Lu Guanqun, Chinese teachers Li Yunzhou and Guan Xibin, and mathematics and science teacher Li Weiqin.</p>
<p>Mingguo Elementary and Middle School: Mingguo Elementary and Middle School on Weihaiwei Road has been operating for nearly thirty years.

<h3 id="e78">Finance: New York Pound at Official Price, Local Foreign Exchange Sterling Flat, US Dollar Loose <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's list showed no ups and downs. In the black market, Sterling was flat, and the US dollar suddenly loosened, because the New York pound price had risen above the official price. From all perspectives, the United States' entry into the European War is becoming more active. Operators considered the news negative, so they sold out. However, HSBC was willing to buy in, and outsiders also absorbed, so it stabilized after loosening. At closing, the US dollar was 5.59375 yuan, and Sterling was stable at 3 pounds 703125 yuan. The US dollar was up 0.0625, and Sterling was flat. There was active trading in Sterling and US dollar in the morning, but no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the London big deal was close to 20.0625, the New York silver price was still flat, and the London gold was stable.

The US dollar was up one and a half cents against Sterling, at 4.03 yuan, and down three cents against Shanghai. There was no market against France. The central government's list of exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening, banks quoted the spot selling price of Sterling at 3 pounds 703125 yuan and the US dollar at 5.53125 yuan, both flat compared to the previous evening's close. After the opening, Chinese speculators unanimously sold, and the market had hardened. It is estimated that the American banks and Youli bought US dollars for August at 5.5625 yuan and 5.59375 yuan, while simultaneously opening for September at 5.5625 yuan. HSBC's list was released and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Thereafter, American banks also switched to selling, because HSBC had the ability to absorb and the potential was still stable. It is estimated that HSBC absorbed American banks' spot US dollars at 5.59375 yuan. Then Chinese banks in Shanghai and American banks sold US dollars for September to foreign banks, still at 5.5625 yuan. By the time of closing, everyone felt relieved, but there were no transactions and prices were rarely changed. As a result of the closing, spot Sterling was flat at 3 pounds 703125 yuan, the US dollar was up 0.0625 at 5.59375 yuan, Sterling for September was up 0.015625 at 3 pounds 6875 yuan, and the US dollar was up 0.0625 at 5.5625 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e79">U.S. Dollar Weakens; Cash Declines <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot cash was sluggish and trending downwards in the gray market. This is because the foreign exchange market is still tight, but expected to ease. It is generally believed that in the near future, it will not tend to weaken. The rumors of the United States entering the war are all negative factors. Therefore, the trading volume on the surface has been very disparate, with only a certain money exchange firm buying, while sellers came in droves, making it unsustainable. Despite several attempts to pull it up, the minority could not defeat the majority, and it finally fell. The opening price in the morning was 5,710 yuan. After a certain money exchange firm bought, it immediately rose to 5,730 yuan. Soon, gold and silver shops came to unload, falling to 5,685 yuan. Later, the money exchange firm re-entered, pushing it back outside the 5,700 yuan mark. However, before closing, it had fallen to a low of 5,678 yuan. The midday close was still at 5,700 yuan, a decrease of 52 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. Trading was still active in the morning, with approximately 1,700 to 1,800 taels. Silver jewelry shops ultimately lowered the price by a small 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Cash Drops 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw a drop of 30 yuan upon opening due to weak market sentiment. A gold shop released 20 taels of silver shop, priced at 5,710 yuan. Shortly thereafter, reliant on the money exchange firm competing to buy, it once rebounded by 20 yuan. The money exchange firm took in 50 taels from gold shops, etc., at 5,730 yuan. Soon after, foreign exchange reports showed easing, and gold and silver shops resumed unloading. Before long, a certain silver building suddenly released a large amount on behalf of a large client. Although securities firms occasionally bought, it was still broken into the 5,700 yuan mark. Gold shops released 10 taels of silver shops, trading at 5,685 yuan. Afterwards, sellers decreased, and fortunately, the money exchange firm revived buying interest, returning the price to 5,708 yuan. Ultimately, due to the foreign exchange easing, gold shops took advantage of the high price to sell again, and the market fell again. Silver shops released 20 taels of cash shops, retreating to 5,678 yuan. However, before closing, fortunately, the securities firms' buying interest re-emerged, and the silver building that initially sold also slightly re-entered, so the closing price was still 5,700 yuan, resulting in a drop of 52 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The fluctuation in the morning was also 52 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but there were some transactions outside the market, with the price gradually falling to 5,690 yuan. Finally, with a lack of buyers, the cash shop's own-brand gold sold for a price that was ten yuan higher than the spot price. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan, and the current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the list price, with few people opening trades.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Reduced by a Small 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, the price for each tael of silver jewelry sold by silver shops remained at 590 yuan among the major firms. Around 11:15, it was reduced by a small 10 yuan, and there were no changes after that. The major firms changed the price to 580 yuan. The new firms had the same price as above, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e80">U.S. Dollar Tickets Fall, While Japanese Currency Rises <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, the spot market trended downwards. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. There was an ample supply of British gold tickets, and the market price fell by two cents. The decline in U.S. dollar tickets was very intense, due to rumors that the United States was about to join the European war, and various pro-seller rumors. As a result, various parties flooded the market with supply, and it retreated to 17 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen in the afternoon, a drop of 2 jiao compared to the previous day's settlement. There was still a strong demand for Hong Kong tickets, and the market price increased by one cent. The rise in Japanese gold tickets became more intense, reaching a high of 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean tickets was still even, and the market price remained flat, remaining at the original level of 1 yuan and 6 fen in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Discount Rate Rises by Only One Yuan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts continued to rise slightly. In the morning, the discount rate was 37 yuan per thousand for those discounting out and 35 yuan for those discounting in. In the afternoon, it was 36 yuan for discounting out and 38 yuan for discounting in, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending within the association did not change, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoting 1 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e82">New Chinese Dime Notes: Bright and Striking <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of one-yuan banknotes and one-dime and two-dime subsidiary currency notes in the city, especially one-dime notes, which are rarely seen on the market. Most of the circulating notes are old and broken five-fen notes from the Central Bank. It is now heard that HSBC has freshly shipped new ten-cent notes from the Bank of China from Hong Kong, with a rather beautiful design and good paper. The front is red and the back is white. A reproduction of the design is specially made to the right, but it is not easy for various sectors to obtain these new dime notes, which seems to offset their function of adjustment. It is hoped that the supply will be greatly increased.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Oilcloth Speculation Goes Awry <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The oil market has been greatly affected by the continued decline in production prices over the past two days. Previously, general firms predicted that foreign merchants would be involved in production areas, and therefore hoarded a lot, leading to excitement and rising prices. However, actual sales could not keep up, and the production price also fell slightly, causing speculative hoarding to rush out, and the market atmosphere sank. The number of transactions also decreased. Yesterday, in addition to 400 pieces of land cargo Jiaozhou raw oil being settled for survival, other transactions included 200 pieces of spot Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at 63 yuan; 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, priced at 63 yuan; 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 94 yuan; 50 pieces of Bingqi soybean oil, priced at 71 yuan; 50 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, priced at 98 yuan; and 200 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil, priced at 76 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, 250 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 1,075 bags were shipped to Singapore. There were also 620 pieces of soybean cake and 500 bags of raw kernels shipped to Singapore, as well as 100 bags of raw kernels, 1,000 cans of raw oil, 388 bags of sesame seeds, and 300 cans of sesame oil shipped to Hong Kong. The day before yesterday, 1,206 cans of tung oil were shipped from Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Securities: After Six Consecutive Days of Gains, Domestic Debt Continues to Rise, with Another Yuan Increase <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bullish trend in the gray market for securities became more and more vigorous. The market situation advanced all the way from morning to night. After six consecutive days of gains, there was actually a sharp increase of one yuan, which has not been seen in recent months. There is an abundance of idle capital, and more and more people are collecting spot goods. However, the rumors on the market are still baseless, using extremely vivid and detailed language, but they are all spread after the market has already risen sharply, and most of them are embellishments. The situation is not yet clear, so there may be a slight pullback today, but it will not be a sharp drop. Yesterday morning, buyers were most active in China One and Ji Kee. Hong Da, Tong Hing, and Jin Wei were also not weak. Union Benefit and Union Harmony also had purchases. The 20th and 38th bulls came out in large numbers, but the market price did not waver. Runli and Tong Kang continued to sell, and the chips were still in short supply. The price rose by 5 jiao to 7 jiao in the morning. Trading was particularly active in the afternoon. Hong Da, Tong Hing, Union Benefit, Xinfu, Le Mao, and Union Harmony also added to their positions or covered their shorts, while the 20th and 38th cuts were still very active. Tong Kang still had sales. The rest, such as retail investors, were sometimes bullish and sometimes bearish, and were exhausted from running around. Yongchang's trading gradually unfolded. As a result of market competition, the price continued to rise by 8 jiao to 1 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 200 shares of China Merchant Electric were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 6 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market opened extremely strong, and the prices of various stocks almost all soared. Later, due to the surge in profit-taking and short selling, the bullish trend was immediately suppressed, and the market situation softened slightly at the close. There were rumors of a strike at British Union, but the price of the stock stabilized. Interest in trading rubber stocks was greater than before.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Only HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose by half a pound, priced at 62 and a half pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, and there were no other gains or losses.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Food: Rice Prices Rebound <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>After fluctuating for two days, the foreign rice market suddenly saw actual sales take advantage of the flat price to make prominent purchases. For a time, floating hoarding and retail investors stirred up trouble, resulting in a shift from the flat and tired state of the past few days to a firm and unusually strong state, rising by more than one yuan. Actual sales then turned lukewarm due to the high price, and floating profit-takers took advantage of the high price to release their goods, but it was already close to the closing time, so the market was still 6 jiao to 7 jiao higher than the previous market. Number One Chen Saigon was priced at 58 yuan and 6 jiao, New Tip at 57 and a half yuan, Number Two at 53 yuan and 2 jiao, 53 yuan, Number One Luo Siam at 58 and a half yuan, 58 yuan. It is rumored that the request for a transport certificate for 100,000 bags requested by the inland party will be signed in the coming days, and the Shantou party is also taking action. In addition to buying a small amount of spot rice, they are also very focused on returning the original packages. Siam Number Two opened at 60 yuan, then rose to 62 and a half yuan, another increase of one yuan compared to the previous market. Saigon Number Two opened directly at 62 yuan and 9 jiao, and the market was still calling higher. Total transactions amounted to six or seven hundred tons, with more than 8,000 bags of spot goods opened. Futures rice once saw a soft market before closing, due to floating holders releasing their goods, but it recovered its bullishness at the close.</p>
<p>More than 40 dan of new Zhoupu japonica rice arrived and sold quickly and smoothly, so the price was difficult to show alongside other goods, and it remained firmly at its original level, continuing to open at 61 and 2 yuan. There was a lack of glutinous and japonica domestic rice arrivals yesterday. Rumors of trading on the open and gray market, coinciding with the rebound in foreign rice, all turned bullish. Selling prices also increased by half a yuan. Chang Bang Qing japonica opened at 66 and a half yuan, 66 yuan. Wuxi Qing japonica opened at 65 and a half yuan, 65 yuan. Changzhou Su Kun japonica opened at 64 and a half yuan, followed by Su 61 yuan, Nangang original package early rice 62 and a half yuan, 61 and a half yuan, Hu Jian 60 yuan to 59 yuan, Jin Li Special Yuan 61 and a half yuan, 61 yuan, Chang Dan Bai Yuan 59 and a half yuan, 58 and a half yuan, Hong Kong Special Yuan 61 and a half yuan, 61 yuan, Medium 58 and a half yuan, 58 yuan, and Yuan 53 and 4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Flour and Wheat: Flat and Dull <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for flour was dull. Checking the prices of two flour mills, the price was 15 yuan. Fuxin and Fufeng can both place orders. It is heard that the Fuxin factory will resume operations as soon as the newly arrived foreign wheat starts to rise. In addition, the northern gang often has difficulties transporting flour, so people are inevitably discouraged. The market price of the Japanese factory's green phoenix flour is also therefore sluggish, with the market price for this month opening at 14 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen, September at 14 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen, and October at 14 yuan, 8 jiao and 5 fen. More than 3,000 bags were traded. Inland flour and foreign flour still saw few imports and exports, and the market was also mediocre.</p>
<p>The new wheat market was also not exciting. Checking nearby vehicles and ships, arrivals were not lonely, but the flat and soft flour prices meant that the factories inevitably focused on buying. It is also heard that a ship of foreign wheat ordered by the Fuxin factory arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is rumored that this wheat was ordered by the Japanese factory, but this has not been confirmed. It can be determined by observing the Fuxin factory's opening and supply situation. Today's market price for high-quality wheat is 23 yuan, and the Japanese factory's purchase price is 21 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 fen, with 3,000 to 4,000 bags traded daily.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Yarn and Cotton: Hand Goods are Being Sold Off; The Yarn Market is Difficult to View Optimistically <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat, and the situation remains in a revolving state. However, although actual sales have not seen wholesale development, the Hong Kong gang continues to make purchases in small quantities, so some people are still optimistic and dragging in goods. However, those holding goods generally believe that the current situation has an oversupply trend, and they are afraid that there will be no major increase in the long term, so they are selling off their hand goods in large quantities.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning, and the situation in the market was still peaceful, with no major changes. The opening price for 20-count Variant Horse yarn was 910 yuan. Soon, a certain scalper household took in one or two hundred bags in the market, and the table felt slightly dry. Asking prices gradually tightened, gradually rising to 920 yuan. Once the high price was reached, it did not rise any further, and those who sailed with the wind sold off, resulting in a decline back to 915 yuan. The closing price was still slightly better. Checking the half-day transaction statistics, 2,280 bags were traded. The market price of 20-count Variant Horse yarn was not much different from the previous day. Today, 1,565 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Counterparts: 1,540 Xiamen: 110</p>
<p>Inland: 100 Hong Kong: 620</p>
<p>Total: 2,280</p>
<h3 id="e88">New Cotton Gradually Enters the Market; This Year's Harvest is Good <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation still lacks excitement. As for the overseas cotton market, it is also in a revolving state. New domestic cotton is gradually entering the market, and it is said that there is a good report on this year's harvest, so everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. The current cotton market remains bleak as ever.</p>
<p>In other news, the overseas cotton market price is firm and active in the New York cotton market. At the same time, due to the improvement in stock prices on Wall Street and the hedging of some funds, the closing price was 4-5 pound coins higher than the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose by one rupee along with the top forecast yesterday.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai cotton market, the sluggish yarn prices in recent days have affected cotton trading. Factory demand has also been quiet. Counterparts, due to the lack of spot goods on the market, are ordering cargo from foreign firms for shipment, but there have been no transactions for several months, and the current war risk rate is quite high, which is equivalent to a price of 56 yuan higher than the spot price.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Spot Sales are Still Lively <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The trend in the cloth market is stable. Spot sales rise and fall, but are still lively. Demand from the northern gang and the Nanyang gang has increased slightly. The opening prices of various goods are flat, with fluctuations of only 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. More than 600 pieces of coarse cloth, grey cloth, bleached cloth, and flannel are handled on this street. More than 100 pieces of heavy flannel, coarse cloth, and serge are handled by the Yantai gang on the northern road. 50 to 60 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill are handled by the Xi'an gang. Several hundred pieces of fine twill and colored cloth are handled by the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs. More than 100 pieces of Shilin cloth and blue cloth are handled by the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs. More than 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, straight tribute, and other goods are handled by the countries of Siam and other foreign countries.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth declined again yesterday, as the actual transaction volume was ordinary and the market was slightly soft. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth in the morning was 31 yuan and 2 jiao, and the market price fell to 30 yuan and 9 jiao later. Four Gentlemen Serge was around 9 jiao and 1 fen. Mid-range fine cloth and fine twill were relatively firm, with minimal increases and decreases.</p>
<p>80 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 21st, 815 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 22nd, and 35 pieces were transferred to Singapore.</p>

<p>Overseas silk prices have fluctuated slightly recently, and the number of transactions on the exchange is also only three or four per day. It is heard that the sales of new artificial silk in the United States are quite astonishing, and the position of real silk is in danger of being shaken. Moreover, the level of silk prices and the strength of silk sales are still related to the subtle diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. Silk trading in Shanghai is quite quiet. The British and French gangs have thin appetite and higher prices (the difference between white factories is 400 yuan). Japanese firms have also been inactive for a long time, but it is said that 150 dan of white factory Zhili were transacted yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market moved slightly. Uncolored Feng Mei pearl tea has seen a gradual start-up trend due to repeated sample mailings and promotional telegrams from merchants in recent days. Yesterday, Jinlong, Tongfu, Yihua, Xiehe and other firms imported a total of 180 boxes of green tea. Pearl tea was sold at prices ranging from 265 yuan to 190 yuan, and Feng Mei was sold at 220-230 yuan. Market prices are all trending towards stability. Black tea is also brewing. It is heard that German merchants have a large appetite, and many tea factories have started production to meet foreign sales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for coarse white and Dutch red sugar continued to rise. The current goods of the association-designated market, 24 coarse white, were 73 and a half yuan for local warehouses, up 5 jiao. The foreign warehouses were 73 yuan in the morning and 73 yuan and 4 jiao in the afternoon, up 6 jiao. Old goods were 72 yuan and 8 jiao, and transit goods were 57 yuan and 7 jiao to 58 yuan, up half a yuan. Dutch cotton white KD mark was 72 yuan and 2 jiao, TML mark was 73 and a half yuan, up 5 jiao to 7 jiao. Dutch red spot goods were 63 yuan, up 1 yuan, and road goods were 62 yuan and 3 jiao.

<h3 id="e93">Coal  White Coal Seemingly Tight, Secretly Loose <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The white coal market, after its self-propelled price increase the previous week, ultimately suffered due to sluggish actual sales in the city. Stockpilers released large quantities, resulting in a situation of external strength but internal weakness, with an apparent tightness but underlying stability. Transactions among firms saw price discrepancies. While the listed price for Hongji white coal was 216 yuan, the black market offered discounts of 10 yuan, causing disorder among shops on this street and inconsistent prices.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Newly Established Water Conservancy Bureau <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since Shanghai opened to foreign trade, sails and masts have crowded the Huangpu River. Fujian and Guangdong sand boats, and other vessels are moored and docked haphazardly in the river's center. Although the area south of the Sixteenth Bund Bridge is not related to foreign ships, it is a necessary route for official steamships traveling from Wusong to Gaochang Temple. When typhoons and tides rise, collisions are a constant worry. Furthermore, boatmen dumping mud and stones, and residents and shopkeepers discarding garbage into the Huangpu River cause great damage to the water conservancy. Previously, Liu, the Circuit Intendant of Songjiang, Suzhou and Taicang, appointed Zhang Hanqing, the judicial commissioner, and Wu, the sub-prefect of Songhai Defense, to survey the boundary from the Sixteenth Bund Bridge to the South Wharf, and to set up boundary markers to indicate the limitations of the wharf. Now, Zhang, the judicial commissioner, has again been instructed to establish the South Section Water Conservancy Bureau in conjunction with the county authorities. From the Sixteenth Bund Bridge to Longhua, four Western-style fir plank patrol boats have been stationed, with officers and patrolmen patrolling day and night, specifically managing the boundary markers along the riverbank, guiding Fujian and Guangdong sandboats to berth in separate groups, and inspecting the dumping of mud and stones, and the construction of wharves along the river. Furthermore, personnel familiar with water conservancy will be dispatched to measure sections at any time. If there are any silting or shallow areas that hinder navigation, poles will be erected to indicate the course to avoid. In the event of matters involving the New Customs Marine Office, harmonious consultation is still required. A general bureau has been established in a rented house located in the South End of the Jianghai Customs, in the Dongting Mountain Wharf Lane, west of the Ankang Villa and separated by a wall. Patrol boats will also be stationed in Nanka, and Shen, the lieutenant colonel in charge of gunboats, will assist in the management.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Ideals and Reality <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>By Wang Da</p>
<p>Reality is the concrete fact in the universe that cannot be denied. Its scope is extremely broad, from the existence of a nation or a society to the growth of a grass or a tree, as well as various things closely related to our daily lives, all of which are included. Ideals are an internal psychological activity that always surpasses concrete facts; however, it is different from fantasy or delusion, because it is created by our intellect and judged by correct rationality. Simply put, reality is the real environment around us, and psychology is the possible imagination of our mind.</p>
<p>Since reality surrounds us, its influence on us is obviously huge and irresistible. Inherited customs, man-made laws, and social moral standards are constantly exerting pressure on us. Whether it is beneficial or harmful to us, we must deal with it. Therefore, dealing with the current reality has become the first priority in everyone's life.</p>
<p>However, if the real environment is too harsh and the troubles it causes increase day by day, then people will involuntarily generate various desires and ideals based on their own preferences. When the time is right, they will resolutely rise up to resist the environment and use their own intelligence to transform an environment that meets their ideals. Therefore, sometimes we can even say that today's ideals often become tomorrow's reality. Such examples are not difficult to find in the history of civilization. For example, democratic politics in the era of tyrannical autocracy was just an ideal in its infancy; similarly, in the field of science, the fact that airplanes can fly today is precisely the ideal that people held when they saw kites soaring in the sky in the past.</p>
<p>From this point of view, ideals and reality can be said to be two good companions on the journey of human evolution, which are parallel and indispensable. Based on reality, ideals are generated, and then ideals evolve into facts. This cycle of endless recurrence is the driving force for advancing cultural history. However, in the vast sea of ​​people, there are often many people who deliberately make biased remarks, either emphasizing reality while belittling ideals, or suppressing ideals while admiring reality. This is really an unwise move. Generally speaking, focusing too much on reality easily leads to vulgarity and baseness. People who suffer from this disease only know how to live in peace and survive, accept whatever comes their way, and succumb to the real environment. They rush to where there is profit, forget righteousness for small gains, and are indifferent to human life. Conversely, people who are too immersed in ideals are only immersed in the beautiful realm of ideals, and the distance from reality becomes increasingly distant. They boast that they are different from the common people. Little do they know that once the beautiful dream ends and life forces them to face reality, they will inevitably find it difficult to cope due to the long-term separation. Wandering on such a wrong path will eventually lead to realizing that they have made no contribution to human civilization, and turn into despair, becoming increasingly pessimistic and unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, the right outlook on life is first of all to recognize reality, grasp reality, and then, inspired by one's own mind, always embrace a correct, error-free, and achievable ideal, with the goal of improving human civilization and welfare, and moving forward on the road of life. In this way, the individual can be considered to have contributed his efforts to the whole within his own boundaries. Now is the eve of the impending decline of human civilization. The young people of the times should be alert, recognize their own tasks, quickly recognize reality, determine their ideals, bravely accept the challenges of the bad environment, and make a desperate struggle for their ideals!</p>

<h3 id="e96">Father <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>By Yu Yu</p>
<p>The body, which has been working for a day, is often soaked in salty sweat. Whenever the sun sinks into the sea and a breeze blows through the clothes, everyone must think of taking a bath and moving a rattan chair to sit in the breeze. If you meet an old man who loves to talk and laugh, you can tell stories about ancient and modern times to the neighbors on the left and right, sighing that the present is not as good as the past, and that one year is not as good as another. Young people will listen attentively with loving and respectful faces, and from time to time ask some surprising questions. Such as: "Did rice sell for four yuan a dan at that time? It's really cheap!" "Grandpa, was there a tram at that time?"</p>
<p>If someone doesn't like these old stories, they can sit alone in a relatively sheltered place, lightly waving a cattail leaf fan, recalling something, thinking about something, which is also very pleasant. At that time, no one would notice that there was another person living in silence.</p>
<p>Recently, friends have seen me and said that I have changed, and I myself feel a little different from before. Since my father passed away this spring, my youthful and active personality has also been buried with my father. I would rather sit alone in melancholy, no longer sitting quietly by and listening when people talk about old stories like before. This may be because I can no longer find my father's voice on summer evenings!</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I slept in the same bed with my father until I lived in school. I remember that every night, whether it was winter or summer, I always loved to listen to my father tell stories. Later, I got tired of hearing my father's stories, so I turned to asking about things from the past. My father often told me about his past struggles, how he borrowed twelve yuan from home to go to Nanjing to study; how he went to Zhangjiakou on a mule cart for a living at the age of twenty, and so on, often mixed with words of encouragement to me: "Look, look, I used to eat radish and rice every day in school. It's really incomparable to now. You have to study hard!"</p>
<p>Last summer, my father may have felt that he was old and would not live long, and feared that his life's experiences would be forgotten, so he said more than usual. Often, one thing was said over and over again, and I seemed to listen patiently, sometimes deliberately asking him questions that I knew very well. Whenever the time was too late, he always said in his old voice: "I have too many experiences in my life. I can't finish talking about them in a few months. I really want to write a book when it's cooler. Alas, I really have to write a book."</p>
<p>The weather has cooled down, and it has gone from cool to hot again. The book about my father's life experiences was never written. My father's old voice can never be heard again, and even my father's shadow will soon be slightly forgotten by familiar people.</p>
<p>Recently, friends have said that I have changed. Yes, I have changed, and my environment has also changed. The idle talks during the cool of the evening no longer arouse my interest. I would rather sit alone in a sheltered place, thinking and recalling, because my father's voice can no longer reach me anywhere.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Dancer's Ending <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Bad News</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou reluctantly sat down on the sofa next to the desk and automatically reported his experiences. The loyal old servant Shi Gui also listened attentively near the door.</p>
<p>He said: "Just now Mr. Hawthorne called me. I happened to be back at the office, so I told him about my investigation into Yu Gantang and Lu Jiansheng's whereabouts last night. Then I asked him about his experiences, and he also told me that Zhao Boxiong lived at 774, 7th floor of the Asia Hotel, but had already moved out. He also told me that at that time, he accidentally saw Yu Gantang, and you had gone upstairs with him. I was just about to discuss a meeting place with him and prepare how to proceed, and wanted to ask him to catch Yu Gantang immediately when suddenly there was a bang in the telephone receiver, like a piece of glass breaking. After that, there was no sound from him. Then there was a buzzing sound, like some kind of disturbance. I knew something must have gone wrong."</p>
<p>I waited for him to pause and continued to ask: "After that, you rushed to the Asia Hotel, didn't you?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said: "Yes, but unfortunately, my car kept running into red lights, which delayed me a lot. When I arrived at the hotel, apart from a piece of the glass door of the telephone booth being broken, there was nothing unusual. Even the broken glass on the ground had been swept away."</p>
<p>"Didn't you see Hawthorne?"</p>
<p>"No, the telephone booth was empty, and there was no one outside the door."</p>
<p>I thought to myself that there were four or five people at the door of the telephone booth when I went down the elevator. Ni Jinshou probably arrived at the Asia Hotel after I left. I didn't think of this at all at the time, so I didn't see the broken glass on the door of the telephone booth either.</p>
<p>I also said: "Of course you had to ask the hotel staff."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied: "Yes, the hotel staff didn't recognize Hawthorne. They only said that a man with a gray thin wool coat and a navy blue suit was shot by someone while making a phone call. The murderer escaped on the spot, and they didn't see what he looked like either. The shot man immediately fell to the ground, but got up in a while, pressed his cheek with a white handkerchief, and walked out. They wanted to send him to the hospital, but the man didn't agree and walked out on his own. They naturally held the principle of 'the less trouble, the better,' and didn't even report it to the court. I thought that the shot man must be Mr. Hawthorne without a doubt." (83)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Tracing the Footsteps of Greta Garbo <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>After fifteen years of competition, Garbo still stands unchanged in Hollywood. Although approaching middle age, inevitably with the beauty of her youth fading, she remains extremely popular. No competitor can contend with her. Is this merely a coincidence?</p>
<p>Before Garbo came to Hollywood, almost no one in Sweden knew her. Only after she met the great director Stiller did she embark on a path of great prospects. He brought her to Hollywood and introduced her to MGM Studios. The contract stipulated a weekly salary of four hundred dollars in the first year, six hundred dollars in the second, and seven hundred and fifty dollars in the third.</p>
<p>Initially, no one paid attention to this foreign daughter. But after the film "The Torrent," audiences worldwide were shaken; they discovered a unique soul in the film industry. At that time, she had no interest in Hollywood, especially as Stiller had failed because he could not understand the American character and psychology, further disappointing her. She almost returned to her homeland with her benefactor, if not for Stiller's earnest persuasion.</p>
<p>Later, she met John Gilbert, one who sympathized with her somewhat. They collaborated on several films, and their daily closeness changed her outlook on life significantly.</p>
<p>As she gradually achieved success, many bad tidings came from Sweden! Her beloved sister died, and her benefactor Stiller died. Courageously, she worked while weeping. However, her poor state of mind forced her to distance herself from the public. "Mysterious Woman" became the nickname generally given to her at this time.</p>
<p>From silent films to talkies, her fame did not diminish at all; on the contrary, it became even more active. She successively starred in many famous films, such as "Mata Hari," "Romance," "Camille," and "Grand Hotel." After "Two-Faced Woman" was filmed, she returned to Sweden for a trip. Upon returning from visiting her hometown, she co-starred with Robert Taylor in "Camille," with Charles Boyer in "Conquest," and with Melvyn Douglas in "Ninotchka." Her most recent new work is the biography of "Madame Curie." Spencer Tracy was Garbo's designated leading actor. It is said that in this film, she not only smiles, but also sings.</p>

<p>Shen Manhua and Wang Hongfu Replace Tan on Stage</p>
<p>Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang's troupe finished their contract yesterday. The management approved the replacement of them with Shen Manhua and Wang Hongfu. The contract is for one month, after which Wu Suqiu and Chi Shigong will continue to perform. Currently, Manhua is in Shanghai, and Hongfu arrived in the South on the 20th by ship from Qingdao. As soon as Wang arrives in Shanghai, performances can begin. The dramatic arts of Shen and Wang are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>Shen is from Yushan, Suzhou. She has lived in the old capital since childhood. With a love for Peking opera, she was able to perform on stage in colorful costumes at a young age. She initially studied Qingyi roles, later also learning Huashan roles. Mei Lanfang, hearing her sing, deemed her promising and accepted her as a disciple. After being mentored by Mei, Manhua's desire to learn became even more fervent, and Mei was happy to guide her. She performed in the old capital for several years, earning a reputation above Wei Lianfang, Lin Qiuwen, and Zhu Qinxin. Her voice is clear, bright, and sweet, almost indistinguishable from Mei's. In addition to excelling in Dan roles, Manhua's Xiaosheng roles are also among her specialties, such as "White Gate Tower," "Shooting the Halberd at Yuanmen," "Flying Tiger Mountain," "Commanding Wine," and "Visiting the Village in Yuejia Village," which are all performed vividly and colorfully, showing that she has learned from a good lineage (Manhua is also a proud disciple of Jiang Miaoxiang), offering a unique experience. At this time of generational transition at the Updated Theater, the collaboration between Shen Manhua and Wang Hongfu is organized, with the renowned Xiaosheng Jiang Miaoxiang assisting them, truly a surprising new force. Wang Hongfu, a Sheng actor, also known as Xiao Baofen, is quite famous in the Qingdao-Jinan area. He once performed in Shanghai and took on leading roles. I have not seen Hongfu's art, but according to the renowned amateur opera enthusiasts Luo Quyuan and Wang Dabang, Hongfu's skills are unmatched by anyone in the Peking opera circle.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Thoughts on "The Wilderness" <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— A Han</p>
<p>Generally speaking, "The Wilderness" is not as tightly structured as "Thunderstorm," nor as tragic as "Sunrise." However, in comprehensive evaluation, the intentions, diction, and all the reflections of "The Wilderness" surpass both "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." This is because it exposes the darkness of the feudal forces of the old society, burying the previous generation and burying the current generation. However, the later generations should fight against the dark environment, even the social system, and create the light of humanity!</p>
<p>Looking back at today's society, although it is no longer the era when "The Wilderness" was published, the life of Chou Hu is still growing and declining among the young community, and many are sacrificed and buried under a somewhat "trumped-up" charge. In the play, Chou Hu avenged his grievances and hatred, and acted boldly without any emotional impulse. Even in the end, he used his own knife as the destination of his life. This, Chou Hu suggests: For the sake of future generations, people of the previous generations should liberate themselves from shackles.</p>
<p>Huang River's personality is always a tough guy of the times. He has reason, he has emotions, therefore: when acting, he also uses his personality to develop the character in the play. Therefore, the leading role of Chou Hu is matched in terms of personality acting. Sun Jinglu's age is very young, but she has already grasped many aspects of style. Her Jinzi completely covers up the demeanor of Cui Xi in "Sunrise" and Sifeng in "Thunderstorm," and presents a typical performance in the form of a rural woman with romantic vigor. Therefore, it has also won excellent results. Zhang Xuemei's Jiao's mother is violent, Wu Jingping's Daxie is cowardly, Ge Xin's fool is stupid, and Chang Yu of Chouhu is innocent. All the characters are personified, intertwined on the eve of the collapse of the old society, and the transmission of acting skills is moving. In terms of scenery and sound, the configuration of the "Wilderness" performance is successful.</p>
