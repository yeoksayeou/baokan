<p>社評</p>
<h3>抗戰時期的水災與水利</h3>
<p>春風駘蕩，西北冰雪解凍，這是濁流開始活躍的季節。傳聞北省人民在水深火熱的外患之餘，又跟着時令而惴惴於水災的或不免於降臨。誰都同情於國民政府的暫時鞭長莫及，他省同胞雖關念北方，然亦徒然感喟於愛莫能助。日本口口聲聲的開發華北經濟，但孳孳於現實的搜括壓榨，當然不理會於所謂水利。</p>
<p>方所謂水災，所謂水利，以黃河爲宗。除北方水災，興北方水利，要在治河。『治百里之河者，目光應及千里之外，治今日之河者，視綫應及百年之前。』這是南通張季直氏一針見血之談，鞭辟入裏之論，但目前控制北方的，當然談論不及於此。原來黃河經大禹大功之後，復成中國大患，又歷二千年。河防水利的建設，爲百年大計，不是一朝一夕所能收效，歷來設有專官，歲靡巨帑，不輟不懈，始得稍弭水患。自遭侵略，幾乎前功盡棄了。黃河在成皐以上，兩岸都是山峽，受了天然地勢的約束，不虞河水氾濫。下流到成皐以東，即爲北方的黃土層，土性鬆浮，遂挾上游泥沙，更與數千里間，涇渭漆沮汾伊洛瀍澗及丹沁諸流相滙合，穿龍門砥柱，直瀉平原；河流湍急了，泥沙沉澱了，河身窄了，河床高了，於是動輒潰決隄防，造成災祲。平時唯賴水利行政工程的防範與挽救。</p>
<p>河患所及，原來不限於黃河流域的河南河北山東數省，即如蘇皖亦受酷烈影響；而歷史所示奇蹟，則影響的大小，每每與外人勢力侵入中國成爲正比例，金章宗明昌五年，黃河奪淮；到了元末，又奪全淮而入海；到了前淸咸豐五年，復北移而由千乘入海。究其因果，洵有難言，但事實如斯，豈易解釋，而抗戰三年，河流亦變遷了。淮河故道自經黃河侵奪，得益於水量者少，受害於泥沙者多，通海之道，亦淤塞了；其間雖有洪澤湖可爲挹注，亦因泥沙倒灌而湖身日高，湖水日溢，宣洩無從，登陸頻繁，造成了「上泛則鳳泗皆哀鴻，旁溢則徐　無寗歲」的局面。國民政府有鑒於此，勵精圖治，前幾年大規模的徵工導淮，疏濬河道，加築隄防，使流有所歸，水有所束；雖工程浩大，未竟全功，然成效業已大著，及至外侮臨頭，抗戰軍興，致使導淮工程難於進行；而兩軍前年在隴海路作戰之際，無情砲火，復先後決中牟的花園河口，及鄭縣的趙口；遂致黃水橫流，由賈魯河直瀉潁河，至皖北的正陽關而與淮水合流；陸沉者幾十縣，面積佔十萬方里，災民近一千二百萬人，這是蘇皖所遭空前大厄，事由侵略，但間接原因，亦關黃河，至於黃河流域的本身，上游依然平穩無恙，而下游豫東一帶，自被日軍淪陷之後，國民政府功令所不及，當然無法溯本窮源而將黃河堵合，目覩浩刧，徒喚奈何。</p>
<p>治河難求速功，但不輟不懈，要爲信條。徵例於上海，平時幾乎人人懷疑於濬浦局的實效，及至去年秋天，因濬浦局二年來的停止活動，黃浦河身日高，造成上海租界內數尺積水，數日不退的現象。又例如北方天津水利失修，以致子牙海河等的洪水汎濫，水深達一丈多深，市民損失估計約達一億五千萬。凡此禍災，吾們當然可以理解它不是天災而是人禍啊！災禍不除則必變本加厲，侵略與洪水皆非例外；據前日路透社重慶消息，濬河專家的意見，認爲黃河經淮而入江，遂使揚子江水道受其惡劣影響，將不僅釀成水災，推其最大的可能，甚至或將損毀江浙兩省數千百農工業城鎭，或將使遠東最大實業貿易口岸的上海，喪失其原有地位云。又謂……中日兩軍前年五月戰於隴海鐵路一帶時，黃河在開封一帶決口，其水經洪澤湖灌入淮河，繼經運河而灌入揚子江，原期黃河之水於本年復就故道，但據此間黃河河工委員會所接最近消息，黃河之水已可決其不復流入故道，其總流現灌入淮河，衝毀中日戰前中國政府導淮委員會所築一切堤壩云。這種推測，誠屬駭人聽聞，然專家的意見，斷非任便可予輕蔑；然則來日大難，自應爲有心人所憂慮，亦應爲抗戰時期所束手無策。蘄求對策，唯有加强抗戰第一，勝利第一的信念。蓋居今日局勢之下，一切水利建設，當然無從談起。明知黃河挾其每秒鐘一萬八千立方公尺的流量，淮河挾其每秒鐘一萬六千立方尺的流量，滙合而直灌入江，堪爲大忠，然而這此之侵略的意圖根本摧毀民族，上而斬斷數千年的歷史。下而奴役十百代的子孫，相形之下，治水災，興水利，猶非所最亟。</p>

<p>芬京　總司令部頃發表戰報稱、（一）喀萊里亞西面、紅軍昨日又迭向教軍進撲、均被擊退、惟在某某數區、我軍業已依照預定計劃、自動撤至新陣地、賡續抗戰、又喀萊里亞區東面、我軍砲隊曾開砲轟擊紅軍、予以重創、幷擊毀坦克車數輛、大砲數門、（二）伊都約基與柯朗約基區方面、紅軍企圖挺進、巳被我軍所阻截、死傷逾千、並損失大批軍用品、（三）古摩區方面、紅軍曾一度進攻、亦被我軍擊退、（四）我國飛機昨曾在前綫襲擊紅軍、蘇聯飛機則在拉多加湖東北面，大肆轟炸、尤以伊馬特拉區被炸最烈、敵機幷會飛往我國內地密開里·顧伏拉·里馬基及其他各處、恣意轟炸、共被我方擊落十七架、各該處居民死傷多人、至本月一日被我方擊落之敵機兩架、機身巳於昨日發現、（三哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　列寗格勒軍區總部公報稱、昨日蘇聯軍隊在喀萊里亞方面繼續包圍維堡、在維堡北蘇軍佔漢姆勒沙里拉、並奪獲司令部及七十六毫米之大砲四尊、在維堡南、蘇軍佔杜伯冷沙里島、奪得堡壘六座、其中包括砲台五座及完好之大砲數尊、在其他方面、則無重要發展、蘇聯空軍轟炸敵軍及敵方軍事目標，（四日塔斯社電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯軍部　發表聲明　正式否認炸平民　國聯調查團抵芬</h3>
<p>莫斯科　列寗格勒軍區總部、頃發表聲明如下、「最近所謂芬蘭政府曾以「牒文」送交國聯、譴責「蘇聯所用之戰爭方法、」該項牒文已由外國報紙刋出、本軍部業將全文詳細審查、認爲所述各節、純係無稽僞造之讕言、</p>
<p>（一）該「文」稱「蘇聯空軍每日均向芬蘭民衆轟炸、」並謂、「數百飛機（五百架）參加轟炸工作、投彈二萬枚、放射機槍、」該項「文件」更誣指蘇空軍轟炸目標係一輩平民、</p>
<p>雖然、該「文」本身巳顯示芬蘭故事作家之愚蠢、即根據不確實之芬方公報、「在空襲中、平民三百九十二人被擊斃」（關於此項數字、該項牒文亦有紀載）、查戰事已進行三個月、苟「數百蘇聯飛機每日均向平民轟炸、則其數何止「三百九十二人」？此點已充分證明業已破產芬蘭統治階級之「牒文」、純係想入非非之揑造、此點並證明蘇聯空軍所轟炸之目標係敵軍及敵方堡壘、機塲及軍事地點、而絕非平民、至於平民懼難者容或有之、但即根據芬方之報吿、彼等亦佔極少數、</p>
<p>由是觀之、該項「牒文」內容之虛僞已極明瞭、芬蘭故事作家弄巧反拙、益顯其窘狀、</p>
<p>（二）該項「牒文」之想入非非、瘋在作家更誣稱、「蘇聯陸軍屢次以芬蘭平民及俘虜作爲衝鋒時之掩護，」並謂、「蘇軍曾施用昏迷毒氣、結果芬兵十一名因此得病、同時、蘇方之海上戰術亦違反國際公法、」</p>
<p>此種毫無根據之報吿、以及該項牒文所稱穌聯巳違反一九〇七年海牙會議、及一九二九年七月二十七日日內瓦會議所規定之戰爭公法一節、全無根據、而純係陷於窘境之芬蘭統治者所造之謠言、紅軍實力堅强、絕無須利用毒氣、且紅軍認爲施用毒氣係一種罪惡、而必須由全世界立即加以斥責、</p>
<p>此種調言、不能挽救芬蘭統治者之末日、目前在喀萊里亞方面、芬蘭軍官當被迫放棄堡壘時、即將不願向蘇聯眾隊作戰之士兵槍決、芬蘭統治者之窘態，實不下于此輩陷于絕境之軍官、</p>
<p>（三）又上述「牒文」爲掩飾芬白衛隊之窘境起見、並謂「蘇軍所佔之領土並無軍事價値、」本部認爲無駁斥此種愚蠢　言之必要、此種謊言與最近芬白衛隊之僞造戰勝報吿、同爲極顯明之荒謬無稽消息、」（四日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>英對蘇態度　將作重要決定　政界認為有改變可能　武力援芬論日趨高漲</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間政界人士頃談稱、英法原已決定在中立所許可之範圍以內、積極援助芬蘭、是以一面應付西歐戰爭、同時又儘量節省軍用品、以接濟芬蘭、惟是、紅軍近在喀萊里亞地峽賡續進展後、英國對蘇聯態度、或有改變之可能、此際雖無何項消息足資徵信、但多數人士咸以爲惟有與蘇聯開戰、始能確切援助芬蘭、前任陸相倍立厦近在「世界新聞報」發表論文、泰晤士報亦於上月二十日發表專文、謂英法對於蘇聯援助德國之舉、未必能長此容忍下去、厥後英國第五軍前任軍長戈區將軍、亦曾發表一文、謂干涉芬蘇戰事、以反對蘇聯之議、實有可取、「十九世紀月刋」則更進一步、認爲此舉、乃係英法獲得勝利所必不可缺者、此外、「時代與潮流」雜誌、亦表示贊同、各晨報雖未表明立塲、但均載稱、現行歐戰範圍擴大至於巴爾幹半島、高加索或挪威等處、均屬可能、至工黨對於此事、意見仍極紛歧、該黨議員多人、近往芬蘭前綫視察、歸來後、咸主進行强硬反蘇運動、徒因多數黨員反對之故、未能見諸實際、要而言之、英國政府必能以軍事的、軍略的曁道義的觀點爲基礎、採取重要決定、英國輿論界雖不欲現行歐戰擴大範圍、而與蘇聯開戰、但倘有新的事件發生、以致有積極援助芬蘭之理由時、則大多數人民、必願予以接受、縱使有與蘇聯開戰之可能、亦所不顧、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美前總統之子　赴芬參戰　指揮英國志願軍　瑞士救護隊赴芬</h3>
<p>倫敦　據援芬辦事處宣布、英國陸軍部、已准美國前總統羅斯福之子、即現任美總統之族人寇密羅斯福氏、辭去英陸軍職務、羅氏今已被任爲在芬作戰國際志願軍中英國隊之指揮官、授上校銜、（四日路透社電）</p>

<h3>昨又有暗殺案　吳其倫被擊死　吳業律師不時涉足歡塲　昨晨家居突遭暴客槍殺</h3>
<p>公共租界同孚路勤益坊三號、於昨日中午十一時十分許、突發生暗殺案、被害者爲本埠充律師之吳其倫、當塲身中三槍、傷及要害、旅即殞命、兇手潛逃無踪、茲將詳情分誌於後、</p>
<p>在庽辦公來不速客</p>
<p>吳其倫、係江蘇灌雲人、現年四十二歲、別署叔彝、業律師、設事務所於同孚路一〇二弄三號、樓上則爲住所、屋爲二幢二下、除將餘屋出賃外、餘均自住、昨午十一時許、吳方在東廂房事務所中辦公、斯際突有不速之客到來叩門、當由女傭啟門延入、直趨吳之辦公室內、</p>
<p>開槍三響均中要害</p>
<p>瞥見吳其倫在內、不問情山、乃袖出手槍、向吳連開三饗、一彈中腰部、一彈中腦部、一彈中右臂、劈拍之聲、宛如聯珠、吳應聲倒地、血如泉湧、兇手見目的已達、即奪門而逸、</p>
<p>流血過多到院身死</p>
<p>當慘案未發生前、吳之姪女肇華、適亦在事務所內、方舉步進入後鬥、驟聞槍聲回顧睹見吳已受傷、倒臥血泊之中、兇手已揚長而逸、驚魂南定、乃大呼求援、家屬曁隣居聞聲雲集、一面報吿該管成都路捕房、亟派中西幹探馳往調查、一面召救護車前來、將吳飛送寳隆醫院療治、無如受創過劇、流血太多、逾時身死、遂將其屍體轉送騐屍所、報謂法院派員勘騐、</p>
<p>本案內幕一般猜測</p>
<p>查吳之被殺、據一般猜測、係屬政治性質、惟個中眞相、一時尙難明瞭、緣吳之髮妻、本係滿洲國傀儡溥儀之小姨、名景慧芳、厥後因故仳離、景即在滬化名王姓、一度淪爲女嚮導、吳則不時涉址歌台舞榭、</p>
<h3>大批洋米又到滬　米價可望下降　已到七萬九千餘包</h3>

<h3>煤塊存底充實　棧存五六十萬噸來價趨低　煙白煤塊約十萬噸又成交　抬價發售煤球已予誥誡</h3>

<p>煤塊成交</p>
<p>關於滬市之煤塊存底·據關係方面消息、確甚充實、囤積浦東各棧者約達五六十萬噸左右、並其來價已稍趨低廉、連日均有絡續抵滬、昨據本市煤業界方面消息、印度安南等地烟白煤塊、業經電洽成交者、約達十萬噸左右、聞本月中間將由以上產地次第裝輪運滬調劑、惟望各煤公司行號、切勿將現貨囤存煤棧、俾投機者無法施技、</p>
<p>門售情形</p>
<p>煤球門售價格、自限定每一百市斤不得超過五元八角、送到另加送力兩角、疊經市商會曁有關係各團體公司公吿、所有全市各煤柴炭店一律遵守、茲有法租界老北門大街中祥泰煤炭號、售出煤球兩擔、竟開價每擔爲六元二角、違背公定價格、現被舉發、市商會以事出初次、已轉函該號切實誥誡、嚴予糾正矣、其平賣煤球、昨為第三日、各處情形一如前日、惟天不作美、終日細雨不止、以致購球平民滿身受潮、顧秩序仍屬井然、法租界愷自通路二七〇號協源煤號第二十七平賣處、昨日首次辦理、購者亦甚擁擠、昨據煤球公會表示、關於平賣煤球，如力所能及、決將繼續辦理、又謂協源煤號無拒絕售球之意、</p>

<p>英美期現均見軋攏</p>
<p>後市狀况初尙平靜、惟期貨續形微硬、後以華商本月期多頭復來力塞、再加外行有利等仍有賣胃、迫三時許、現貨亦硬達四辦十一四〇六二五、及六元七八一二五可結、人後華商續來吐予外行本月份美滙六元七一八七五與七五、同時外行互做四月份美滙六元六八七五、及錢兌業售予華比美金票六元八七五、是以過程更鬆、迄至收盤、英金四辦士二五六二五、美滙六元八一二五、本月期英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元七五、下月期英金四辦士〇七八一二五、美滙六元六五六二五、結果比上週末現貨英長〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、本月份英鬆〇六二五、美賤一二五、下月期英長〇七八一二五、美硬一五六二五、</p>

<h3>中美貨款成立　金市一片喊賣聲　逼近四千七百元關邊</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、跌風愈大、不堪回首、業已破入四千八百元大關、實因上週末塲中利空傳說仍未消散、更以報載美總統已批准貸華鉅額借款、且以當日匯市現期均鬆、故浮多賣出絡繹不絕、午後金號證券帮競塞更力、雖中途港帮曾來扒進、但終難挽住跌風、至晨開即撳小十二元、爲四千七百九十元、不久錢兌業等塞出、其時外滙期貨步硬、再跌十五元、後以某金號曁某銀樓忽代港帮搜購、期時外匯已報轉定、一度堅穩、回升至四千七百九十二元高峯、卒因此後港帮買意中止、再加錢兌業與散戶等復來競吐、午收祇四千七百七十九元、午後初尙吿穩、不久復見下瀉、乃某金號和證券帮等售出甚夥、雖港帮其間復來扒吸、但頭寸仍感充斥、曾退達四千七百十五元低價、幸某銀號趁賤重來撈進、略回十餘元、爲四千七百三十三元收盤、結果比上週末軋跌六十九元、全天交易約二千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌七十元弱</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因報載消息利空、人心疲弱、一片喊賣聲、首由某銀號售予證券帮五十兩、爲四千七百九十元、較之上週末撳小十二元、旋以外滙期貨步長、形勢又虛、錢兌業傾向力塞、同時散空亦接踵而來、遂步降十五元、錢兌業出證券帮等共百兩、價均爲四千七百七十五元、其時某金號　某銀樓忽代港帮乘機力吸、買氣忽濃、而散戶亦稍復進、一度回起十七元、某銀號進錢兌業十兩、爲四千七百九十二元、此後港帮停止活動、勢又不支、再加某金號與錢兌業競相賣出、且證券帮亦來復吐、遂步小十七元、錢兌業出某銀號五十兩、又遜至四千七百七十五元、午刻賣風稍息、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲四千七百七十八元作午收價、午後開市、撳低四元、銀樓帮互做三十兩、爲四千七百七十五元、少頃證券帮稍吸、拉起七元、誼券帮進銀樓帮十兩、爲四千七百八十二元、旋乃某金號突來湧塞、不支下瀉、立降二十餘元、雖其時港帮忽來撈進、但某證券帮多頭乘機斬結、且滙市步鬆、故難阻止、跌風竟再暴落數十元、證券帮金號出銀號共三十兩、爲四千七百十五元、入後某銀號趁低復進、同時錢兌業亦有拖入、遂回起二十五元、證券帮出錢兌業五十兩、爲四千七百四十元、將近收盤時、因證券帮復來吐售、重又降低七元、銀樓帮互做二十兩、爲四千七百三十三元作晚收價、結果比上週末猛跌六十九元、全天七十七元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>外幣虛弱</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、因銀根緊張未弛、且久傳之美國貸款、行將成立、我國金融獲國際之援助、將益臻鞏固、是以市塲人心樂觀、英美金鎊、供給暢盛、市價下降、英美金票、多趨吐塞、納胃呆滯、市况甚虛、晚市英金票降爲五十五元、美金票降爲十四元四角四分、香港票法郎票、需要稀少、新加坡票荷蘭票、俱趨虛弱、坎票斐律濱票、步美金票後、跟隨下降、日金票略疲、晚市爲一元三角、朝鮮票瓣要微殷、晚市爲一元零二分、昨日市價、英美金鎊、俱降一元五角、英金票降二角、美金票降二角四分、香港票降二分、法郎票降四釐、羅比票降五分、新加坡·荷蘭·坎票、斐律濱票、俱降一角、其他各幣未更、</p>

<h3>貼現軋小二元　拆息掛高五分</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、略見盤跌、每千元上午始終在七十四元左右、下午一度做低至七十一元、終又上升至七十三元、比上週六軋小一元、錢業公會拆息、突掛高五分、晨午兩市均開二角云、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米大宗有到　米價頗多鬆象　銀根之緊或係一因</h3>
<p>米市自前一度先升後降、昨則晨開雖客販心思尙堅、無如一般浮囤散戶、一見市面挫折、相繼回出、店家實銷仍無興緻、回籠貨欲謀脫手、不能不出於讓價一途、市面頓呈跌風、迄收盤各色洋米價先後計落半元至六七角、若一號西貢四十七元七角、四十七元半、二號西十四元半、四十四元、高四十五元、火絞除寳塔牌特貨開四十六元半外、餘者雜牌僅售四十六元左右、暹暹特一號雖喊聲未小、尙欲售四十七元、奈此貨銷路殊細、不若火紋之歡迎、致未做開、大市開四十五元二角、及二號以價盤低廉、較有問津、然行情祇售四十三元半、四十三元、獨特別米菉則則以全市僅有一千三百餘包、客販旣無意輕脫、作客亦頗靑垂、市價能站住、未見變化、仍開四十二元四五角、較次者亦須四十元左右、小絞高售四十三元半、大市貨四十三元至四十二元七八角、東京砶尖特自四十三元三角、次至四十一元半、香港紅米四十二元、混合碎三十七元、次至三十五元半、而久已未聞新到之明黨白粳、昨則業見出樣、開四十八元、洋米新交易有大批定妥、共有一號西貢二百噸、價五十八元二角、由達孚售出二號三千噸、價自五十三元至五十二元六七角、由達孚合義仁記建源等售出、統由糧商辦進、然市上回籠二號已降至五十二元半、其他期現各米一致趨落、</p>
<p>洋米大量接踵而來、華綸洋行大浦輪、自西貢裝來二萬六千二百八十一包、於前日（三日）下午四時抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧、昨晨起開始起卸、又怡和洋行裕生輪、昨晨抵埠、計自海防運來洋米五千三百三十五包、又從香港裝來二千五白十八包、停靠法租界羅斯福碼頭起卸、又丹商捷成洋行之Eilford美富號輪、自西貢直接運來洋米三萬餘包、昨午十一時許進口、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<p>變元去路本滯、際此疲檔、遂更難以立足、同貶半元光景、若　陽特元售四十三元、金壇特元四十二元半、丹陽特元四十二元、次祇四十元左右、客元三十八元半至三十八元、又南港陰元四十一元半、至於厚薄粳及早晚稻其內地來源依然無所轉出、而塲外暗盤已成强弩之末、寥落異常、聞昨仍僅南港早晚稻略有做開爲四十六元、亦小元許、</p>
<h3>粉銷平淡　麥市互擯</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市復趨疲憊、蓋自上週末一度高昂後、嗣以客銷平淡、且目下洋粉售價與本粉相近、一般客戶需要者、均注意洋粉、故回籠粉市面、無形帶挫、聞洋砲台及狐狸牌等售開十五元至十四元八角、客帮　有取辦、老車牌回籠粉因祗限於本街內地零銷，價亦鬆至十四元七角半、其他各牌、概無正市、市面不脫醞釀之局、</p>
<p>小麥　交易經上週一度擯局後、尙未開始活動、蓋目下市塲供源寥落、執貨大都不願輕脫、而華廠方面進胃不貪、日廠亦思抑價而取、故上午買賣互持、聞下午成交三四車、高蘇麥價與上週相仿、其次略見鬆疲、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債潛勢堅定　外股遭受　賣方壓力</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、因多頭出籠、市價堅而後疲、大都爲押款不易做得、故人心稍見紊亂、惟中美借款二千萬美金、行見成立、國際信用又見增高、經濟基本更見鞏固、債市前途、仍屬易漲難跌、昨日上午初開、市價仍頗堅挺、雖永康同康以及一般散戶求售頗湧、而大都均爲多方所吸收、惟收買者稍有扳價、將市價稍疲、午後久豐補空稍有動辦、協大鴻康繼續買進、中一需要亦起、雖同康·同順·恒孚等賣出、而市價已堅定、結果回小二角至三角半、成交總數共計約七十餘萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股一百股，價爲現鈔十九元零五分、比前劇漲數元之鉅、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市賣方氣燄極爲兇猛、溯自上年九月各股價格開始抬高以來、尙未見有如此跌風、浮多竟日了結、價格急遽下瀉、將近收盤、實業股方面、買戶定單湧至、價格由最低點上騰至速、收盤各種主要股之需求均佳、橡皮股因實業股疲弱而被帶低、生橡皮之價雖漲、橡皮公司之獲利展望雖佳、暫時亦被忽視矣、</p>
<h3>開平煤礦派息　每股七厘半</h3>
<p>英商開平煤礦有限公司、截至一九　九年六月底之股息、已擬定分派年息七厘半、即每股派英金一先令六便士、一俟提交三月六日在英倫舉行之股東常年大會報吿、即可開派云、</p>
<h3>紗花　洋花鬆軟　棉商多頭心思　比較澹泊</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉趨岑寂、此因外棉狀况衰弱、加之紗市不振、目跌風尤熾、而外匯轉入穩靜之途、並見放升、於此多頭心思澹泊一步、蘇北來源到通花三百〇六包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日晨初開盤、因投機者之賣出、利物浦帮在市拋賣頗烈、海外棉商亦紛紛在市賣出、因之市况殊呈疲乏之狀、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落八九磅音、印度又因投機者之賣出、昨日連同預測又跌三羅比埃及漲十餘磅昔、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、雖殊為靜寂、然人心奇好、售價不因海外棉市之降落而鬆軟也、同業間乘機購買者頗爲衆多、然竟有無貨以應之概、廠方交易始終靜寂異常、日方廠商亦以到貨甚擠、購意較爲淡薄、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二二支　美米特林　二六〇·二〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級二四九·三〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　二七二·七〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　下級二六一·六〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　二七六·五〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　下級二六一·七〇</p>
<h3>投機心理轉變　紗市急轉直下</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且漲風漸起、此因報載中美貨款二千萬元、業已成立、於是一般投機心理、稍有轉變、謂外匯頭襯當可寬籽　步、暫時或可穩定矣、所以買者反形賣出、檯面較鬆、市情乃急轉直下、二十支雙馬二月期開盤曾到九百〇八元、旋後直落至八百九十一元、收盤以後、又復回到八百九十七元半、不過港帮實需尙稱維持也、</p>
<p>現紗首開以美印棉市結軟、而借款美總統業已批准、人心稍受打擊、浮多紛起出籠、二十支雙馬三月份開盤價爲九百〇一元、因多頭拖進，回漲至九百〇八元、俄頃聞美匯微升、人氣空虛、直破九百元關口、跌至八百九十一元、迨至收盤時有一部份因其下跌太鉅、復來吸收、又漲達九百元、收盤以後又回疲三四元、查半日間成交統計二千二百三十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨跌八元、三月期跌十四元、今晨有紗五件運港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、六六〇　香港　四四〇</p>
<p>內地　一三一　統計　二·二三〇</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆疲憊不振</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆行市、續修五六角、市氣疲憊之局、一時恐難轉好、蓋交易雖有少數囤戶間有拖進、但實銷不起、統市成交丁家州豆二車、價爲二十六元三角至二十五元五角、南京豆二車、價爲二十二元五角至十九元、安慶豆一百三十包、價爲二十二元五角、蕪湖豆四百包、價爲二十三元五角至二十二元八角、及平湖杜豆五十包、價爲二十四元四角、至豆子出口、今（五日）有三百包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油實銷呆滯　行情回落元外</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、在實銷依然不振之局面下、到存兩接、致人心渙散、操縱者無機可乘、結果行市較之上週六跌去一元外、統共做開大速原油一百四十桶、價自一百十四元五角跌至一百十三元、漢口油六十桶、價爲一百十二元五角至十二元、天津油四百聽、價爲一百零八元、烟岐油一十件、價爲八十三元、靑岐油十件、價爲八十二元、查生油出口、今（五日）有七百六十聽、運往香港、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤暗盤遜色</h3>
<p>煤屑煤球、自平賣以來、塊煤交易、亦日見淸淡、多方進胃、似已滿足、新貨湧到傳聞、亦日形濃厚、故人心望下、暗盤未免遜色、印度喀爾喀塔塊、囤記棧單、每噸二百五十元至二百六十元、統貨便宜　餘元行情、但實銷不旺、僅本街略有點綴、門莊發客、酌加行槓、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭產電、粗白價爲荷盾九·八〇、比前小〇·〇七五、本市公會劃盤、略有隨鬆、現貨二四粗白降二三角、本棧貨六十二元半、外棧新到六十二元二角、老貨六十二元、轉口貨不動、太古車白上檔無甚上落、下檔小四五角、西棧B嘜仍六十六元、東棧六十五元四角、小二角半、西棧CX嘜六十三元半、DY嘜六十三元、HX嘜六十二元六角、H嘜車赤四十五兀、老貨四十四元、荷赤回小二角、MP嘜四十七元、WA嘜四十六元半、本廠雪白六十二元、小五角、國糖仍堅、聞靑糖略有開出、價乏更動、</p>

<h3>浙省義敎實施現狀　（二）</h3>
<p>關於義敎經費的保管和支取手續、均經訂定辦法頒布施行、而尤注意專款存儲這一點、以保障其獨立、至年度節餘經費、則限令列入下年度預算、不准移作別用、但專實各縣縣政府仍有藉統收統支之名、而行捐款挪墊之實、所以對這一個問題有二點是値得大家討論的、（一）敎育經費應否實行特別會計制度、（二）任意移用之弊、應如何設法防止與糾正、這兩個問題如能澈底解決、那末、義敎經費的獨立、才得有事實的保障、</p>

<p>（四）實騐與視導短期義敎、係新創事業、敎訓行政各方面、應行實騐事項、當然甚多、本省自念四年度第二學期起、即指定省立學校附屬小學六所、担任此次實騐研究的工作、實施事項、有短小國語暫行課程標準及課本之實騐修訂、普通小學二部編制的實騐、經費合用的敎具及其他設備之實騐、短小招生留生問題、兼辦一二種切實有效之社會改進活動、及各科敎學法的實騐等十餘種、先後均有詳細報吿到廳、審核後、即介紹各縣參考、以期改進、視導在敎育行政上占極重要的地位、但必須有固定的人員、才能奏效、尤以義敎之推行、務求普遍、短小校班的設置、至爲散漫、本廳原有視導人員、數量旣少、任務又繁、實難兼顧、因此從念五年度起、特另設義敎視導員二人、以期提高義敎實施效能、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>自由的眞諦</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>現社會所行的，是一種自由貿易的制度。自由是人類所應享的權利，自由貿易可以由引起競爭而得進步，這原是很好的。可是現在這自由貿易的制度却使我們走上了物價暴漲民不聊生的危境了。</p>
<p>自由是好的，可是一個人的自由不能侵犯到別人的自由，這才是自由的眞諦，這樣大家才都能享受到眞自由。</p>
<p>現社會的毛病就在這裏。我們實行了自由貿易的制度，可是我們却不曾予這種自由以相當的限制。於是掙錢自由，投機自由，囤積自由，把持自由，欺騙自由，壓榨自由，剝削自由；自由的結果，自由都跑到少數人的手上去了，而多數人所得到的，僅僅是所剩下的可憐的「挨餓的自由」而已。</p>
<p>如果要使現社會走上合理的途徑，我們對於貿易的自由，必須先予以相當的限制，尤其是與人民的生計直接有關的物品其貿易更應該有嚴格的限制與調度。在這民窮財盡的生死關頭，如其不實行貿易的限制，與生活必需品的調整計劃，則我們的社會有一天將走上混亂與滅亡的路。</p>
<p>我們不能够再順其自然了。</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>星塵</h3>
<p>— 雄生</p>
<p>我們日常所看見的塵埃，不過是些細砂與泥土等，而且其中多數含有有機物質，與航行大洋海輪舶的甲板上，或南北極的積雪面上所看見的不同。因爲大洋海和南北兩極爲尋常陸地的泥沙所極不容易飛到的地方。故此，這種的塵埃，科學家給他一個的名稱叫做星塵。此種星塵其有磁性，係金屬質；若用科學的方法分析出來，其分子含有鐵，錳，鎂，鎳，硫，鉛及其他各種的化合物。因它的質量較尋常的泥砂爲重，故此落在海洋面的時候，即漸漸下沉至海底，積累成爲石塊了。</p>
<p>據天文學家所研究的結果，證明天空中實在有無數體積極微小的慧星，依其一定的軌道繞日而行走，軌道半徑的長短，各不相同，而且它環繞的形狀，常常成橢圓形，故與地球的軌道多成交叉狀，當每一年一定的日期，當地球轉動到交叉點時，而此種慧星亦於此時行至交叉點處，於是二者互相接吸，但此種慧星的吸引力，較地球的吸引力薄弱很多，故地球的吸引力，不致受到任何影響，而慧星則受地球吸引力的吸引，於是踰出軌道，被地球吸人地面空氣範圍以內，其飛行向地面的速率，每秒鐘在十英里至四十英里之間，而此時慧星與空氣遂發生極大的摩擦力，生熱而發光，此即我們平日所看見的流火與流星，此等慧星在約距離地面五十英里至七十英里的時候，即完全燃燒，分解而爲碎片或粉末的塵埃。大的成爲隕石，小的細小如針鋒，浮蕩飄颺空中高處，漸漸而降落地面，而爲星塵。又據天文學家博爾頓研究結果，說地球因受隕石而增加重量，每日大約在二百噸左右，每日懸在空際的慧星粉末約有四千萬粒云。</p>
<p>空氣的外層，因爲常懸有此多量的固體星塵，故當薄暮的時候，此種星塵中因受着空中溫度的變遷，故附着有極大的水蒸氣，斜射的日光，遂受此種蒸氣的反射，映在地面上，成爲燦爛的霞光，每年十月十一月時，晚霞特別顯明，此因星塵量較他時爲强的緣故，而南北極的極光，亦無非是因星塵的作用的。</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<h3>求學</h3>
<p>— 小岑</p>
<p>不要忘記了你的自修。學校，書本，敎員不過是帮助你；而眞的知識要各人自己去求。</p>
<p>你可以從自己的觀察，經騐，讀書，和別人的談論得到智識。</p>
<p>當你看到一本書的新奇目錄時，該在心中先存一讀書的目標。</p>
<p>在一個時期中集中你的注意力於內容相同的幾本書，比讀同數目而內容不同的書籍更容易，便利，並且可節省你的時間和精力。</p>
<p>留心別人的談話，可以得到許多實用的智識。</p>
<p>假使你有不能了解的學識，或不能完成的工作，不要以問人爲羞恥。</p>
<p>的確，能自己學習的人，其讀書的成就，比較被强迫而讀書的人要容易得多，因爲他們能了解讀書的理由，並且有一定的目的與願望。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>秘密的笑聲</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>德國自國社黨秉政以後，曾經產生了不少的笑話，以下幾則是其中的代表作：</p>
<p>（一）猶太人與虎</p>
<p>有一天，柏林動物園中的老虎逃出來了，在近郊的鄕間造成了極大的恐怖。政府特遍貼佈告，懸賞捕捉老虎，不論生死都好。</p>
<p>有兩個猶太人看到了那張佈吿，其中一人突然面無人色，慌慌張張地向另外一個人耳語說，「我們還是早點逃吧，免得被人擊斃。」</p>
<p>男外一個人覺得有點莫明其妙，說，「爲甚麼呢？我們又不是老虎。」</p>
<p>「我曉得的，」另外一個猶太人沉吟地說，「可是我們有甚麼證據呢？」</p>
<p>（二）莫談政治</p>
<p>有一天晚上，一個老年人在柏林市上遇刦，並被毆打，於是高呼「救命啊！殺人啊！」這時有一個警察走上前去，叫那老頭子別響，說，「不要這樣高聲談論政治啊！」</p>
<p>（三）等甚麼？</p>
<p>那天有一個人在柏林街上候公共汽車，有一個秘密警察跑上前來問他：「你在等甚麼呢？」</p>
<p>那人回答道：「我在等國社主義到德國來。」</p>
<p>（四）偸聽談話</p>
<p>有一天，希特勒和戈林在汽車中談論國家的秘密。當汽車遇到紅燈停在路口的時候，後面也有一輛汽車跟上來了，停在旁邊，車中也坐着兩個人。當時其中一個人碰巧打呵欠。</p>
<p>戈林看見了，連忙命令護兵說：「把那兩個人抓去，因爲他們偷聽我們的談話。」</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>文章出處</h3>
<p>— 闞西文</p>
<p>上海自經淪陷後，文化事業和出版界遭遇空前未有的低潮，有一時期幾乎陷入於停頓狀態中；這當然是可惜的，但爲了國家民挨，受這樣微小的犧牲，是極應該的事，何况以上海的文化資力，散佈於文化落後的內地，就整個國家說來，也說不上損失；更何况上海文化的前途，正未可限量。所以我們並不該因遭遇這樣空前的低潮而灰心，還應該努力奮鬥。</p>
<p>但自最近二三月來，上海的出版界忽然有了復蘇的現象，這現象爲好爲壞，我且不去膂他；只從馬路旁報攤所見，出版物種類之多，五花八門，多得令人數不淸楚，而且當此紙價及印刷材料奇昂之日，居然都印得非常考究漂亮，實在令人佩服他們不惜犧牲爲文化服務的毅力。</p>
<p>出版物如此之多，總不能不印上黑字吧，於是稿子的需要也求過於供了，常常喜歡動動筆的「作家」們，於是也多了機會；但我不知道這是否是好機會？</p>
<p>在許多出版物中，僅翻翻目錄，有時也會發現我所熟悉的人物，我深信他們天眞無邪，僅爲發表慾的衝動而寫作文字；不過也按捺不下我的驚奇。倘使我是一個雜誌的編輯人，則此後對他們投來的稿子除文字之外，又得加一重另外的考慮了。</p>
<p>我覺得寫文章，固然是一件很有興趣的事但寫了却不必一定要發表（雖然我寫了這篇文章，是非發表不可的），發表對於一個寫作者並無什麼好處。一個謹嚴的作家有寫了十年文章而不肯發表的，但一待發表，便一鳴驚人，他的文名立刻不脛而走了。但這樣的辦法當然不是一般人所能辦到的，我們不能以聖賢之道治衆人；無已，則也應該考慮一下發表的處所。此即古來士君子的所謂「出處」，「出處」不　，即爲終身之玷，我們寫文章也應如此，何况又左這艱難的大時代中。</p>

<h3>實行的宗敎　（三）</h3>
<p>若上帝爲眞理之靈，做宗敎徒便是在我們一切關係上實行眞理；若上帝是美，宗敎即爲美的行爲；若上帝是愛，宗敎即爲人生一切關係上善意的實行。宗敎必須始終能實行，今日多數敎徒的大難處，就是他們只注重宗敎的一面，而且是最易實行的一面。有人說，美國的淸敎徒，在主日跪下拜神，在平日却跪在黑人身上尋開心。這種批評，是否確實，我們暫可不論，不過，我們確有不少的信徒，在主日唱詩，念經，拜神，到了星期一便一切都忘了的。所以，諸位，我們信仰上帝，是與我們對待上帝的兒女，我們的兄弟姊妹的方法，有關係的。宗敎的旨趣，原不是要人驕傲，自私，冷酷，乃是要人體諒，友愛，同情，諒解，你許知一切道理，和哲學，你可以燃燭祈禱，唱詩背經，若是這一切不能引你爲他人做點工夫，你所做的皆爲徒然。不愧基督徒之名者，不是那只愛上帝而不爲上帝做事的人，乃是那愛上帝而又以服務和善意的精神待人的人。德國馬克斯有一句話說。「宗敎是人民的鴉片。」凡是眞有知識的人，決不相信這一句話。不過，細想起來，他的話，也不無道理，因爲許多人與不良的敎徒接近，他們的生命變成憂鬱而殘廢了，我們的信仰和儀式，必須和日常生活聯緊起來。我們今日所需要的不是較多的基督徒，乃是較好的基督徒。現在是我們實行宗敎的時候了。（待續）　（諸君如欲研究請函郵箱一二二七號）</p>

<h3>平津梨園界最近的趣事　巨款被竊不偵自破　冒名伶無獨有偶</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>比得津友書，知平津伶界，最近發生兩趣事，茶酒肆，資爲談助，而報章所載，獨語焉不詳，蓋趣事亦怪事也。</p>
<p>故都各界，無不知有「金璧輝司令」其人，爲某方担任某項工作，奔走平津　寗關外各地，蓋即前淸肅王女公子而以巾幗異人稱於世之川島芳子也。最近，金在平寓祝壽，裙屐聯翩，親朋雲集，名伶往賀者允夥，某武生亦與焉。迨酒闌席散，金忽發覺失去一皮篋，此中纍纍者儲紙幣達四萬元許，遍覓無着，　是日某武生辭去獨早，金亦未之疑也。新春，金徧至各親朋處謝壽，至某武生家，僅武生之祖母在堂，見金至，頗露驚惶狀，遽携一皮篋出曰：「小孫無狀，前日誤將此篋携來。」則赫然爲失去物也。金携歸檢視，少萬餘金，是夕，某武生方在某劇院登臺，遂被逮捕，經人說項，始得寢事。而其內慕，則個中人諱莫如深，殆係別有原因者？某武生英姿玉立，談者謂有桃色關係，否則以名倫而作賊，不偵緝而破案，蓋亦梨園秘聞也巳。</p>
<p>沽上某票友，聲音笑貌，慕仿李盛藻極神似，日前忽異想天開，以某名妓素喜結納名伶。遂自稱李盛藻，甫自平來津，即將登臺某院，妓竟爲所蒙，以李之肯垂靑於已也，遂亦大施籠絡，日與綢繆，未幾，爲識者揭破眞相，某票友始悄然遁去，而妓亦懊萬狀矣。又有某烟窟者，日者忽來一客，自稱袁世海，新自滬搭輪北返，將在沽上中國大戲院登臺，以包銀未付故，遂數至吸烟而分文不付，烟窟主初不之疑。某日，有烟客素識袁世海者，聞其自稱袁世海，大異，詢之，傲然而應，怒詰之，始知係作僞騙烟吸者，烟窟主人卒亦無如之何。以冒充名伶而無獨有偶，洵怪事矣。</p>
<h3>崑曲的話</h3>
<p>— 嚴成熙</p>
<p>戲曲開端於元代。實在說起來，曲還是由詞變來的，自董解元（金）的西廂彈詞，引起王實甫（元）作西廂記，這可說是戲曲的鼻祖，後來因蒙古方言南方人不易了解，高明（元末）就作琵琶記，是爲南曲，戲曲的分爲南北，也就從此始。嘉靖以後，北曲衰微到極點了，南曲也變成了一種長篇的戲劇，叫做傳奇。到嘉隆之間，傳奇更加盛行，作家如梁辰魚，屠隆等都名聞一時。</p>
<p>元時唱南北曲的，已經梢稍加入絃索檀板，但並不嚴肅而是混亂的。到明代崑山魏良輔才改革舊習，具備各種樂器，由海鹽，餘姚，弋陽諸腔中擺脫出來，變成爲一種聲律嚴肅樂色完備不限於地方性的戲曲。因爲創始於崑山，就稱爲崑曲。南曲自有崑曲以後，好像換了一個面目，勢力也漸增大。</p>
<p>魏良輔創始崑曲後，一時師事他的很多，而接他衣缽的却是以傳奇浣紗記得名的梁辰魚。芳畬詩話云：「世所謂崑山腔，自良輔始，而伯龍獨得其傳。」梁字伯龍，也是崑山人，爲當時大學生，風流自賞，爲詞家所宗，甚至「每傳柑楔飲，競渡穿釘，羅列絲竹，歌兒舞女，不見伯龍，自以爲不祥。」著有散曲江東，白苧，雜劇紅綫女，紅綃及傳奇浣紗記；第一個崑曲劇本的作者，也就是他。</p>
<p>崑腔創行沒有多時，便盛行各處；北曲本來已很衰微，到道時就完全消亡了。常時吳中也極推重崑路，沈德符顧曲雜言：「自吳人重南曲皆祖崑山魏良輔，而北詞幾廢。」別書也有記載。有人以爲崑腔是謹嚴的，深切的，和中世紀幼稚的戲曲相比較，覺得進步得多。這大概就是崑曲能推行四五白年之久的原因？</p>
<h3>程硯秋不日到滬　馬連長荀慧生亦將分批南來</h3>
<p>— 陳琳</p>
<p>鬚生奚嘯伯，此次來滬，出演黃金，成績頗佳，以契的關係，演至本月二十左右，即將打住。演罷後，黃金當局，已預定三批角色。</p>
<p>第一批　角色，係程硯秋領導下之秋聲社。硯秋自二十七年冬載譽北返後，未嘗南米，此次應聘黃金，捲土重來，一般程迷，聞訊之下，無不雀躍三百。硯秋現已率領全體，離平去濟南出演，演畢再去靑島，由靑島起程來滬。大約本月底可到。硯秋去濟南出演所帶之鬚生爲陳少霖，但將來出演黃金，則仍與其老搭擋王少樓合作。其他配角方面，大致與前次來滬相同。小生有姜妙香顧鈺蓀，小丑有曹二庚李四廣慈少泉，老生有張春彥，老旦有孫甫亭，靑衣有吳富琴。所稍異者，即秋聲社之花臉，自侯喜瑞脫離後，已改邀劉連榮抵坑。連榮此次將隨秋聲社南下。硯秋之傑作「紅拂傳」弓硯緣一「貞娥剌虎」諸劇演來當更能生色矣。希悉程氏新編「燕子箋」一戲，此次來滬，亦將與滬人相見云。</p>
<p>第二批　角色，爲最受滬人歡迎之馬連良，連良在平，編排新劇，改革服裝，聲勢頗大，此决應聘黃金，屆時將有不少新貢獻。廿所新編之臨僮山」，全部「莊子」兩劇，將次第在滬演出。「臨潼山二戲，連良飾秦叔寳，穿改良方旗靠，在平出演時，轟動九城。全部「莊子」，自莊子得道起，演至大劈棺止。黃金方面有芙蓉草在將與之搭配飾田氏，此二戲外，連良尙有富連成秘本之「五彩輿」一戲。預備來滬連演幾大。連良所預定同來之配角，除張君秋葉盛蘭馬富祿劉連榮等老搭擋外，丑爭兩行將加邀蕭長華袁世海。武生則由馬君武易爲吳彥衡。連良並定製薪行頭數千元，以備來滬演唱新戲之用。屆時必將轟動一時。</p>
<p>第三批　角色，為荀慧生。慧生已八載不曾南來出演，茲以慧生滬上友好某某諸君之從中奔走，乃允該院所請早日南來，惟日期則由慧生自定。</p>
<h3>馬連良之「十道本」</h3>
<h3>老舒戲言　考綱籃</h3>
<p>— 舍予</p>
<p>邇來有因御碑亭一劇，王有道赴試所携之籃，應爲何種式樣而起爭辯者，蕭恩打漁殺家」靴鞋問題以後，此爲敢近發生討論之材料。劇中舉動物事，自應有檢討之必要，如皆認爲平凡而過，便覺興趣不多。今之考籃問題，某某所爭論之點：一為絕對不見用網籃，且不可用網籃；爲王有道之入考塲，應帶一容量較多之考籃，爲適合情理，况循守舊規之演家，多爲網籃，即使不必遵古泡製，而在必須改良者亦認網籃爲更切實際，陣錢中似乎網籃趨優勝勢，而考籃一經擊破，遂有不能復入王有道手中之概。如此熱鬧，洵不讓以前靴鞋專美，吾以爲用網籃帶到考塲者，可稱此有網之籃爲考網籃，一曾憶售籃之商店，似有考網籃之名詞，若考籃而用爲裝貯菜餚，則又不妨名其籃爲食考籃，事實上，旣可見用，考籃入廚房以作盛餚之器，便不必冉以爲網籃帶到科塲乃絕對奇怪之事矣。因戲作考網籃爲爭論者進一解。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on Various Routes in Hebei Suffer Repeated Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Southern Hebei: Since the middle of last month, Japanese troops in various parts of Hebei Province have been showing signs of activity, but they are all merely bluffing and are vulnerable to attack. A unit of the Chinese army in western Hebei ambushed Japanese troops moving from Quyang to Dingxian at Gaomendian (west of Dingxian) a few days ago, inflicting heavy casualties and destroying several Japanese vehicles. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army destroyed more than ten kilometers of highway south of Yixian, seizing over two thousand catties of electrical wire. Furthermore, a unit of the Chinese army captured Sunzhuang south of Pingshan County, killing over three hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing sixty-four rifles and horses. The remaining Japanese troops retreated towards Jingxing. The Japanese troops at Changping, Nankou, and Mentougou advanced towards Miaofeng Mountain and Yangshan (northwest of Beiping) north of the Yongding River, engaging in fierce fighting with a certain unit of the Chinese army for several days. All were defeated, with a total of over four hundred Japanese soldiers killed. The Chinese army captured over sixty rifles and over twenty horses. The remaining Japanese troops in the northwestern part of Hebei Province currently have no ability to act again. The Chinese army in Hebei Province has already launched a large-scale encirclement campaign towards central Hebei. The Japanese troops active in the southern part of central Hebei are in a state of collapse. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Shanxi War Situation in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Xingji: The war situation in Shanxi this week was most intense on both sides of the Tongpu Railway in southern Jin. On the east side, there were frequent engagements at the end of last month on the line of Fushan, Yicheng, and Jiangxian. The Chinese forces advanced along various routes and achieved many victories on the Fulin Road. Japanese forces in each stronghold are now fearful of Chinese attacks and are on high alert. On the west side, the Japanese army reinforced their troops and harassed areas such as Heilongguan, Fencheng, Xinjiang, and Jishan this week, leading to fierce fighting. The Japanese troops in Jishan and Xinjiang were subjected to a counter-attack by Chinese forces and retreated mostly back into the city. Small groups are still active, and the Chinese are currently destroying them separately. Over a thousand Japanese troops were added to the Heilongguan area this week. Since the 28th, they have repeatedly attempted to invade westwards but have been repelled. On the morning of the 1st, Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked the Jingjiashan and Baihuling areas in the southeast of Puxian. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Wan'an also attacked Qiaojiawan, coordinating with each other with great momentum. The Chinese army calmly faced the enemy and engaged in mobile operations from morning to noon, repeatedly charging the Japanese lines. Fearing encirclement by the Chinese, the Japanese retreated towards Heilongguan and Wan'an. The fighting in the triangular area was also intense. The Chinese launched fierce attacks on Zhangdian and Ershiling for days, causing the Japanese forces to waver and urgently transfer troops from Linfen for reinforcement. The Japanese troops in Xiaxian and Wenxi attempted to take action but failed to succeed. The morale of the Chinese army is boosted, and progress is smooth. The war situation in Shanxi Province is becoming more optimistic. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Floods and Water Conservancy During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>The spring breeze is gentle, and the ice and snow in the northwest melt, marking the beginning of the season when turbulent currents become active. It is rumored that the people of northern provinces, amidst the foreign invasion that puts them in deep water and scorching fire, are also concerned about the potential for floods that may be inevitable. Everyone sympathizes with the National Government's temporary inability to reach them, and fellow countrymen in other provinces, though concerned about the north, can only sigh helplessly at their inability to assist. Japan constantly proclaims its development of the economy of North China, but its focus is on the immediate exploitation and oppression, and it naturally disregards what is called water conservancy.</p>
<p>When one speaks of floods and water conservancy, the Yellow River is the source. To eliminate floods in the north and develop water conservancy in the north, the key is to control the Yellow River. "Those who govern a hundred-li river should have their sights set a thousand li away; those who govern today's river should have their sights set a hundred years ahead." This is a penetrating statement by Zhang Jian of Nantong, but those currently in control of the north are of course unable to discuss this. Originally, after the great achievements of Yu the Great, the Yellow River once again became a major disaster for China, and it has been so for two thousand years. The construction of flood control and water conservancy is a long-term plan for a hundred years, and its effects cannot be seen overnight. Historically, special officials have been appointed, and huge sums of money have been spent annually without interruption, and only then could flood disasters be slightly mitigated. Since the invasion, almost all previous efforts have been abandoned. Above ChengGao, the Yellow River is constrained by the natural terrain of the mountains and gorges on both sides, so there is no fear of the river overflowing. However, downstream to the east of ChengGao is the loess layer of northern China, which is loose and unstable, so the river carries sediment from upstream and merges with the flows of the Jing, Wei, Qi, Ju, Fen, Yi, Luo, Chan, Jian, Dan, and Qin rivers over thousands of miles, passing through the Dragon Gate and the Zhidong Pillar, and flows directly into the plains. The river becomes turbulent, the sediment settles, the riverbed narrows, and the riverbed rises, so dykes and embankments are often breached, causing disasters. At ordinary times, we rely on the prevention and rescue of water conservancy administrative engineering.</p>
<p>The impact of the Yellow River disaster was originally not limited to the Yellow River Basin of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, but also severely affected Jiangsu and Anhui. Historical miracles show that the impact is directly proportional to the intrusion of foreign forces into China. In the fifth year of the Mingchang reign of Emperor Zhangzong of the Jin Dynasty, the Yellow River seized the Huai River. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, it seized the entire Huai River and flowed into the sea. By the fifth year of the Xianfeng reign of the former Qing Dynasty, it moved north again and flowed into the sea through Qiancheng. The causes and consequences are difficult to explain, but the facts are such, and how can they be easily explained? In the three years of the War of Resistance, the rivers have also changed. The old course of the Huai River has been eroded by the Yellow River, receiving less benefit from the water volume and more harm from the sediment. The passage to the sea has also been silted up. Although there is Hongze Lake that can be used for storage, the lake has been rising daily due to the backflow of sediment. The lake water overflows, and flooding occurs frequently, creating a situation where "when the lake floods, Fengyang and Sizhou both grieve, and when it overflows, Xuzhou and WuNing have no good years." In view of this, the National Government has been striving to govern, and in recent years, it has extensively requisitioned labor to guide the Huai River, dredging the river channel and building embankments, so that the flow has a direction and the water is controlled. Although the project is huge and has not been fully completed, the results have already been significant. However, when foreign aggression came and the War of Resistance began, it made it difficult to carry out the Huai River diversion project. During the battles on the Longhai Railway two years ago, the indiscriminate artillery fire broke the Huayuan River mouth in Zhongmou and the Zhaokou in Zhengxian. As a result, the Yellow River flowed horizontally, flowing directly down the Jialu River to the Ying River, and joining the Huai River at Zhengyangguan in northern Anhui. Dozens of counties were submerged, covering an area of 100,000 square miles, and nearly 12 million people were affected. This is an unprecedented disaster for Jiangsu and Anhui, caused by the invasion, but the indirect cause is also related to the Yellow River. As for the Yellow River Basin itself, the upstream is still stable, but the downstream area of eastern Henan, after being occupied by the Japanese army, is beyond the reach of the National Government's regulations. It is of course impossible to trace the root cause and block the Yellow River. Seeing the disaster, one can only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>It is difficult to seek quick success in controlling the river, but persistence must be the creed. Take the Shanghai example. At ordinary times, almost everyone doubts the effectiveness of the Junpu Bureau. However, last autumn, due to the Junpu Bureau's cessation of activities for two years, the Huangpu Riverbed rose daily, creating a situation where the Shanghai Concession was flooded with several feet of water, which did not recede for several days. Another example is that the water conservancy in Tianjin in the north is poorly maintained, resulting in the flooding of the Ziya and Hai Rivers to a depth of more than ten feet, and the estimated loss to citizens is about 150 million. We can of course understand that these disasters are not natural disasters but man-made disasters! Disasters will inevitably intensify if they are not eliminated, and invasion and floods are no exception. According to a Reuters report from Chongqing the other day, experts on river dredging believe that the Yellow River's entry into the Yangtze River via the Huai River has a negative impact on the Yangtze River waterway, which will not only cause floods, but may even damage thousands of agricultural, industrial, and commercial cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, or even cause Shanghai, the largest industrial and trading port in the Far East, to lose its original position. It is also said that... when the Chinese and Japanese armies fought in the area of the Longhai Railway in May of the year before last, the Yellow River breached its banks in the area of Kaifeng, and the water flowed through Hongze Lake into the Huai River, and then through the Grand Canal into the Yangtze River. It was originally hoped that the waters of the Yellow River would return to their old course this year, but according to recent news received by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission here, it has been determined that the waters of the Yellow River will no longer flow back to their old course. Its total flow now pours into the Huai River, destroying all the dikes built by the Huai River Diversion Committee of the Chinese government before the Sino-Japanese War. This speculation is indeed shocking, but the opinions of experts cannot be lightly dismissed. Then the great disaster of the coming days should be worried about by those who care, and should also be something that the War of Resistance cannot cope with. To seek countermeasures, the only thing is to strengthen the belief in the primacy of resistance and the primacy of victory. Because in today's situation, any water conservancy construction is of course out of the question. It is clear that the Yellow River carries its flow of 18,000 cubic meters per second, and the Huai River carries its flow of 16,000 cubic feet per second, and that the confluence flows directly into the Yangtze River, which is a great disaster. However, this aggressive intent fundamentally destroys the nation, cutting off thousands of years of history from above and enslaving hundreds of generations of descendants from below. In comparison, controlling floods and developing water conservancy are not the most urgent tasks.</p>
<h3>British Embassy Stationed in Shanghai; No Rift with Chongqing; Butler Responds to Questions from Members of Parliament; Says Policy Towards China Unaffected</h3>
<p>London: At the meeting of the Lower House today, Conservative MP Dr. Lape asked whether the Government was prepared to take appropriate measures, since the National Government of China was now in Chongqing and the British Embassy in China was in Shanghai, 1,800 miles away, so that after the end of the war, Britain's commercial position in China could be restored to its former state. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "I stated in the House of Commons on the 20th of last month that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, has been in Chongqing for some time and has not yet left. The Embassy has a permanent office in Chongqing, and even if Ambassador Kerr is stationed in Shanghai or goes elsewhere, he can still maintain contact with the National Government of China on all matters relating to British commercial interests." Dr. Lape further asked whether the Government had sent important personnel to Chongqing to deal with all important matters at any time, since the British Ambassador to China was 1,800 miles away from the seat of the Chinese government. Undersecretary Butler replied, "Ambassador Kerr has been stationed in Chongqing since the beginning of this year. Even if he leaves in the future, there will still be appropriate personnel there to continue all negotiations." At this point, Davidson, a Labour MP from the opposition party, interjected, "Then is our country's policy towards China also 1,800 miles away from the Chinese government?" Undersecretary Butler replied, "No." (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Has No Sincerity in Opening the Yangtze River; Hata Shunroku States That Japanese Military Must Decide</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese Minister of War Hata Shunroku in the House of Representatives Budget Committee today, if a third country takes a threatening attitude and hinders Japan's military operations and its actions to maintain peace and order in China, the Japanese army will not open the Yangtze River. He also said that Japan's expression of its intention to open the Yangtze River last December was a unilateral decision by the Japanese side and was not intended to elicit a good response from other countries. Because Japan's expression of its intention to open the Yangtze River was not an expression of a promise on the Japanese side, it is up to the Japanese army to decide when to open it. In other words, it must be opened after the Japanese army is properly prepared. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Eager for Talks: Franco-Japanese Discussions</h3>
<p>Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Suma Yakichiro, stated today that the Japanese government is eager to hold talks with the French government to find ways to improve political and commercial relations between the two countries.

The Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada Renzo, has already held preliminary talks with the French Foreign Ministry, the contents of which have not been announced. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Major Changes Expected Among Close Advisors to the Emperor; Yuasa Feels Unease</h3>
<p>Tokyo – It is widely rumored in political circles here that major changes may occur in the near future among the close advisors to the Emperor. The most significant of these is that Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei may submit his resignation. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Yuasa has been involved in manipulating the reorganizations of successive wartime cabinets, but now it is said that he has expressed to people his intention to retire. According to reports, this public figure has stated that since 1937, the cabinet has been changed four times, exposing the weakness of Japan's political structure. Although this situation is due to the war, he cannot absolve himself of responsibility. However, in political and parliamentary circles, it is rumored that the relationship between Minister Yuasa and the military has become increasingly delicate since the beginning of this year. The military's mouthpiece, Kokumin Shimbun, published an article on the day of the inauguration of the Yonai cabinet, attacking Yuasa, stating that Yuasa had launched a "conspiracy" around the Emperor, causing General Yonai to be appointed as Prime Minister, while other candidates who were closer to the military were excluded. Although this kind of criticism is not very public at the moment, it has not disappeared. Yuasa, in this delicate situation, should voluntarily retire, and the central authorities can thus usher in fresh air. In addition, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira Tsuneo also intends to retire. The reason for this is not yet clear. It is speculated that this public figure has always advocated pro-British policies and has often been criticized by certain parties, so he feels that it is necessary to resign together with Yuasa. Regarding this rumor, well-informed sources here recently said that it may not happen immediately, but one thing can be said with certainty, that Privy Council President Konoe Fumimaro, who has always had good relations with the military, is currently studying the situation. Regarding the issue of changing the close advisors to the Emperor, he may offer his personal opinion and recommend his close friend, Marquis Kido Koichi, to succeed as Minister of the Imperial Household, and have Goto succeed as Minister of the Imperial Household.

<h3>Japanese Government Promotes National Savings; Practically Unfeasible; Economic Crisis Looms</h3>
<p>Tokyo – In order to cope with the financial plans for issuing bonds and national production, the Japanese government has stipulated that the total amount of national savings for the fiscal year beginning April 1st should be 11,900,000,000 yen. In other words, all men, women, and children across the country must save an average of 119 yen each in the next twelve months. It is found that farmers account for about 74% of the Japanese population, and it is also found that the average annual net income of the 5.5 million farming households in 1935 was less than 102 yen. In the coming year, with the cost of living and tax burden higher than ever before, it will be difficult to achieve this level of savings without concerted national efforts. An official of the Ministry of Finance said that he knew it was extremely difficult for lower-level officials, low-wage earners, and those who depend on wages to make savings of 119 yen each, but the people must try their best to overcome the difficulty. Kokumin Shimbun said that if this amount cannot be reached, inflation cannot be stopped, and the streets will be filled with banknotes. Furthermore, if the people do not save and accumulate large sums, the structure of the expansion of production in Japan, Manchuria, and China will be as easy to collapse as a house built on sand.

<h3>Japanese Diet Member Saito Dispels Resignation Intentions</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Regarding the issue of the resignation of Mr. Saito Takao, Director-General of the Minseito Party's Parliamentary Affairs, Uchisaki, and fellow members Yatsunami Takeharu, Shian Shinkuro, and Okazaki Hisajiro have been working hard to mediate. However, the Seiyukai Innovation Faction, the Jikyoku Doshikai, and other factions have not joined the negotiations, insisting on their position and not making any concessions. They do not allow Saito to resign. Therefore, at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th, the meeting of Saito, Nomura, Yamamichi, Kawasaki, Yatsunami, Shian, Kudo, and Okazaki at Mr. Okazaki's private residence completely broke down. At this time, Saito retracted his previous intention and expressed his intention not to resign. He then left and took the train west to his constituency in Hyogo at 3:00 p.m. (Domei News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Welles Arrives in Lausanne; Compiles Report on Visit to Germany; Will Soon Go to Paris to Visit French Authorities; Rumor that Hitler Made Five Points</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland – U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here this morning from Berlin and immediately went to Lausanne, where he will stay until the 6th of this month to prepare a report on the details of his talks with the German authorities and send it by telegram to President Roosevelt. He will then go to Paris to hold talks with the French authorities. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles left here last night for Paris after discussing the possibility of peace in Europe with Chancellor Hitler. Welles passed through the "Western Front" of Germany's strongest region, Basel, on his train journey to France. When he left Berlin, he did not carry any hope for an early peace. Reliable sources claim that "Welles feels that the German people and leaders intend to abandon a long-term war and launch a fierce offensive in the spring under the cover of the air force." At this time, the German press broke its silence on Welles' visit to Germany. German newspapers warned that a new stable Europe and the restoration of peace can only be built after Germany's victory. Germany's victory will shatter Britain's attempt to subdue Germany. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome – There is no criticism here regarding U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' meeting with Hitler, but the dispatches from Berlin carried in various newspapers reflect the German view that peace initiatives have absolutely no chance of success. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>The Hague – According to a Berlin dispatch in a local newspaper, Hitler proposed five procedural points when he met with President Roosevelt's representative Welles on Saturday and Sunday: (1) Germany must possess Bohemia and Moravia and Poland (the annexation of Austria by Germany goes without saying); (2) Britain must not engage in conspiracies or exert influence in the Scandinavian Peninsula; (3) Britain's pirate nests in Malta, Gibraltar, and Singapore must be eliminated; (4) Germany applies the Monroe Doctrine in Central Europe; (5) Return German colonies. Hitler claimed that Germany could only cease fire after the above conditions were fulfilled. Hitler also strongly advocated that the United States should send an ambassador to Berlin again. Welles has now set off for Basel, Switzerland. German newspapers today only carried very simple news about Welles' talks with Hitler and Ribbentrop. No further official information has been announced, but Reuters has learned that a slightly more detailed communique will be issued soon. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris – Foreign observers here recently stated that after conducting talks in Rome and Berlin, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles is taking a short break in Switzerland and telegraphing President Roosevelt about the situation. Although the outside world knows nothing about the content of his talks with the German authorities, one point has been confirmed, namely that German leader Hitler had a long discussion with Undersecretary Welles on the Finnish issue. Hitler is eager for the war between Finland and the Soviet Union to end as soon as possible so that the Soviet Union can provide economic assistance to Germany in the spring of this year. In other words, if the Finnish army holds out for a few more weeks, the ice and snow in various parts of the country will melt due to the warming weather. At that time, military operations on both sides will inevitably be interrupted for several weeks. Since the war between Finland and the Soviet Union will have to be prolonged, the assistance that Germany expects from the Soviet Union will also become increasingly distant, which is not what Hitler wants to hear. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland – A correspondent for the Basler Abendblatt in Berlin recently reported that when German leader Hitler met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday, it was only known that the scope of the talks was extremely narrow, and nothing else was known. As for the talks conducted today by General Göring, the dictator of Germany's Four-Year Economic Plan and Minister of Aviation, with Welles, it is said that they mainly focused on various economic issues. Undersecretary Welles also had lunch with former German Minister of Economics Dr. Schacht at noon today. As for the written reply that Hitler will present to U.S. President Roosevelt, it is said that it will be personally delivered to Welles by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland – The German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur recently issued a message stating that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles left for Basel, Switzerland, this afternoon after staying in Berlin for a day. German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker, Director of Protocol Toenpner, and the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Germany and various embassy staff members were all at the station to see him off. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Budapest – It is rumored that German leader Hitler told U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles that Germany not only wants to control Poland but also wants to control Hungary. Responsible figures here recently firmly denied this, saying that Hungary's independent sovereignty has a solid foundation and there is no room for borrowing. Foreign observers say that according to the repeated expressions issued by the German authorities, the space they call vital for survival includes not only Hungary but even the entire Central Europe.

<h3>British House of Commons Questions Peace Proposals; Butler Replies, Saying They Lack Authenticity</h3>
<p>London – The peace proposals initiated and published last week by Lord Tavistock and the British Christian Council for Reconciliation in Europe became the subject of questioning in the House of Commons this afternoon. Undersecretary Butler declared that the British government did not provide any special assistance when Tavistock went to Dublin. After Tavistock returned here, he immediately announced a proposal that claimed to be the conditions under which the German government could negotiate peace. Before this proposal was published, it was notified to the Foreign Secretary by Tavistock. Setting aside the merits and demerits of this proposal, it is quite clear that it cannot be proven to have been drafted by the German government or be considered authentic. He knows that the German government and the German embassy in Dublin have denied this proposal. A Member of Parliament then asked whether the government recognizes Tavistock's actions in this matter, or whether any individual can negotiate and submit reports to the government. Butler replied that Tavistock did not represent the government in any way. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Turkish Talks on Border Demilitarization; Near East Situation Eases</h3>
<p>Milan – According to the "Stampa," Turkey and the Soviet Union have each sent representatives to negotiate and discuss the withdrawal of troops stationed near the border between the two countries to avoid conflict. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia – There is currently great attention being paid to the political developments in the Near East. According to a report from the political newspaper's correspondent in Turkey, Turkish political figures believe that there may not be a war in Asia Minor. The reason is that from the perspective of the Allied countries, if the scope of the war expands to the Near East, the position of Britain and France will become worse. First, Britain and France will have to fight on foreign territory. Second, Britain and France will have a new enemy, Russia. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Territory Must Not Be Violated; Belgian Foreign Minister Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Brussels – Foreign Minister Spaak recently issued a statement declaring that the territorial integrity of Belgium should be respected by other countries, and said, "Our troop numbers have been replenished, and defenses have been prepared everywhere. If another country attempts to invade our territory, it must pay a heavy price." Minister of Public Works Matagne also issued a statement saying that the House of Representatives has passed a plan to ban foreign propaganda within our country.

<h3>Italy Protests to Britain over the Blockade of German Coal; Believes It Contradicts the Anglo-Italian Agreement and Violates the Spirit of International Law</h3>
<p>Rome – After the British government decided to consider the coal shipped from Germany to Italy as contraband to be detained, the Italian government protested to the British government, stating that this decision is of great importance and is illegal. The coal shipped from Germany is of great importance to our country's economy. Your government's decision to blockade it contradicts the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16, 1938, and is sufficient to disrupt the political and economic relations between our two countries. Our government is eager to clearly explain the key points of the current situation in order to point out where the responsibility lies for possible developments in the future. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome – The British government recently informed Italy, declaring that from the 1st of this month, the British Navy will also inspect German coal being shipped to Italy. The Italian government recently sent a reply to the Foreign Ministry, protesting, saying that current international law has provisions to protect the commercial interests of neutral countries. The British government's decision to inspect coal purchased by Italy is completely inconsistent with the letter and spirit of international law. Furthermore, the British Navy's inspection of mail on the high seas also contradicts the Hague Convention of 1907. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the Italian government's protest against the British government's decision to consider German coal shipped to Italy as contraband, it has been delivered here. The government authorities will carefully consider it within the scope of considering Italian interests. However, Germany's methods of warfare are barbaric and arbitrary, harming most countries indiscriminately. Since Britain has entered into war with it and has decided to use economic warfare against it, in order to protect its own interests, it cannot abandon the various major rights permitted by international law. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to a report released by the Italian Bureau of Statistics, the coal-producing areas of Suisis and Alsace produced a total of 1,925,000 tons of coal last year, an increase of 40% compared to the previous year. At the same time, 1,058,000 tons of soft coal were produced. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim Leader Attacks the National Congress; Sir Haroon Appeals to America</h3>
<p>New Delhi – Sir Haroon, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the All-India Muslim League, today published an article asking the American people to study the political situation in India in detail, saying that the American people's interest in Indian freedom is commendable, but we hope that before expressing opinions on Indian affairs, they will study all aspects of the Indian problem in detail, because the Indian problem has many difficulties that cannot be reduced by the current declarations made by the All-India National Congress to the United States. The 90 million Muslims and the Hindus are distinct from each other, but the All-India National Congress, which is purely composed of Hindus, wants to rule the Muslims with Hindus. This can be proven by the experience of the Congress's two years of tyrannical rule in various provinces. The National Congress advocates independence, and its purpose is to establish a majority of Hindus under a federation with the power to abolish Muslim independence, and it does not allow independence even in provinces where Muslims are in the majority. What the National Congress calls independence is nothing more than wanting to enslave 90 million Muslims. Muslims are determined to resist it. Muslims are not opposed to India's independence and are always seeking India's independence, but the main obstacle is that the National Congress cannot gain the trust of Muslims. American people should understand the basic points of the current dispute between Britain and the National Congress. The point of contention is how to control the 90 million Muslims. The National Congress is unwilling to address this issue, so Britain only has two options: either demand that the National Congress and the Muslims and other minorities negotiate a solution, or recognize the demands of the National Congress and plunge the Indian peninsula into civil unrest. Muslims and other minorities combined are stronger than those represented by the National Congress, so Muslims hope that those in America who love India will persuade the National Congress leaders to have an appropriate level of patience and understanding. The demands of the Muslims are very simple. The 90 million people want the right to self-determination and want to obtain separate homelands in the majority areas so that they can manage their careers and lives without being disturbed by others.

<h3>Soviet Artillery Bombardment, Viipuri Falls, Finnish Army Moves Positions to Continue Fighting, Ice Broken to Prevent Flanking</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - With Viipuri fallen, the Finnish army will now defend a new line that offers less cover than the front line before Viipuri. The next two weeks will be a severe test for the Finnish side. If the Finnish army can hold this untested line within these two weeks, the snowfall and melting snow in March may save their declining situation. The lack of Finnish soldiers and artillery are the two main reasons for the fall of Viipuri. The Soviet army is now occupying Viipuri. Once the occupation is complete, the Finnish army will be forced to retreat to a new line behind the city. The strength of this newly created line is highly questionable. The rapid advance of the Soviet army near the Karelian Isthmus is astonishing. Although Viipuri was heavily bombarded by Soviet aircraft and artillery a month ago, it was still a complete city. Now, it is a pile of rubble with smoldering fires. The Finns did not abandon valuable items, as large amounts of food and goods stored in factories and shops have been completely transported away, and all important buildings have been destroyed or burned. Viipuri Castle, which once served as the headquarters of the Finnish commander in the area, is now just an empty shell. To prevent the danger of a Soviet flanking maneuver, the Finns have completely shattered the ice along the coast of the Gulf of Finland. According to Finnish sources, the fall of Viipuri is important in terms of national morale, but not strategically, as the city itself is not a military defense site. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Fierce fighting has been raging on the outskirts of Viipuri. The Soviet army is indiscriminately bombarding the town with artillery. Due to strict Finnish censorship, it is impossible to know how far the Soviet army has advanced. It is believed that Finnish defenders near Perkjärvi and the Heinjoki railway station may have been forced to retreat again in the last twelve hours. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - Red Army troops have been attacking Viipuri urgently for days, but according to reliable sources, the city's 15th-century castle still flies the Finnish flag with a white background and blue cross. Today's battles are taking place on the northeastern outskirts of the city. The Finnish army is currently firmly defending the northwest line outside the city to resist the enemy's advance. This line is part of the Mannerheim Line and has been repeatedly strengthened in the past three months. Its sole mission is to protect the railway line from Simola to Imatra, which reduces the strategic value of Viipuri itself. As for this railway line, it runs parallel to the southern defenses of Finland and is of great military value. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - Several Red Army soldiers parachuted behind Viipuri today in an attempt to attack the Finnish army from the rear. All of them have been captured. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - The General Headquarters has just released a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army repeatedly attacked our troops yesterday but were repelled. However, in certain areas, our army has automatically withdrawn to new positions according to plan to continue fighting. Also, in the eastern part of the Karelian region, our artillery bombarded the Red Army, inflicting heavy casualties and destroying several tanks and artillery pieces. (2) In the Itäjoki and Kollaanjoki regions, the Red Army's attempts to advance have been intercepted by our army, resulting in over a thousand casualties and the loss of a large amount of military supplies. (3) In the Kuhmo region, the Red Army launched an attack but was repelled by our army. (4) Our planes attacked the Red Army on the front lines yesterday. Soviet planes extensively bombed the northeast side of Lake Ladoga, especially the Imatra area. Enemy planes also flew to Mikeli, Guovola, and other places in the Finnish interior, carrying out indiscriminate bombings, resulting in multiple casualties among the residents. Seventeen enemy planes were shot down by our forces. The wreckage of two enemy planes shot down by our forces on the first of this month was discovered yesterday. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Leningrad Military District Headquarters announced that yesterday, Soviet troops continued to encircle Viipuri in the Karelian direction. North of Viipuri, Soviet troops occupied Hämeenlinna, capturing the headquarters and four 76mm artillery pieces. South of Viipuri, Soviet troops occupied the island of Tuppura, capturing six fortresses, including five artillery batteries and several intact artillery pieces. In other areas, there were no significant developments. The Soviet air force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets. (TASS, 4th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Denies Bombing Civilians, League of Nations Investigation Team Arrives in Finland</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Leningrad Military District Headquarters has just released the following statement: "Recently, the so-called Finnish government submitted a 'memorandum' to the League of Nations condemning the 'war methods used by the Soviet Union.' This memorandum has been published by foreign newspapers. Our military headquarters has carefully reviewed the entire text and believes that all the allegations are pure fabrications.</p>
<p>(1) The 'document' claims that 'the Soviet air force bombs Finnish civilians every day,' and states that 'hundreds of aircraft (500) participate in the bombing, dropping 20,000 bombs and firing machine guns.' The 'document' further falsely accuses the Soviet air force of targeting civilians.</p>
<p>However, the 'document' itself reveals the stupidity of Finnish storytellers, who, based on inaccurate Finnish communiqués, claim that '392 civilians were killed in air raids' (this figure is also recorded in the memorandum). Considering that the war has been going on for three months, if 'hundreds of Soviet aircraft bombed civilians every day,' then the number would be far more than '392.' This fully proves that the 'memorandum' of the bankrupt Finnish ruling class is pure fantasy and fabrication. This also proves that the Soviet air force bombed enemy troops, enemy fortresses, airfields, and military locations, and never civilians. As for civilian casualties, they may occur, but according to Finnish reports, they account for a very small number.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the falsity of the 'memorandum's' contents is extremely clear. Finnish storytellers have overreached themselves and further exposed their embarrassment.</p>
<p>(2) The fantastic delusion in the 'memorandum' writer claims that 'the Soviet army repeatedly uses Finnish civilians and prisoners as shields during charges,' and states that 'the Soviet army used nerve gas, resulting in eleven Finnish soldiers becoming ill.' At the same time, 'Soviet naval tactics also violate international law.'</p>
<p>This kind of unfounded report, as well as the memorandum's claim that the Soviet Union has violated the laws of war stipulated by the 1907 Hague Convention and the 1929 Geneva Convention of July 27, is completely baseless and purely a rumor created by the Finnish rulers who are in a difficult situation. The Red Army is strong and has no need to use nerve gas, and the Red Army believes that the use of nerve gas is a crime that must be immediately condemned by the whole world.</p>
<p>This kind of rumor cannot save the Finnish rulers from their demise. Currently, in the Karelian region, when Finnish officers are forced to abandon fortresses, they execute soldiers who are unwilling to fight against the Soviet army. The plight of the Finnish rulers is no less than that of these officers who are in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>(3) In addition, the aforementioned 'memorandum,' in order to conceal the plight of the Finnish White Guards, also states that 'the territory occupied by the Soviet army has no military value.' Our headquarters believes that there is no need to refute such foolish statements. This kind of lie is as obviously absurd as the recent fabricated victory reports of the Finnish White Guards." (TASS, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to newspapers here, the League of Nations' committee to investigate the Soviet air force's bombing of undefended cities and Finnish civilians has been formed. Well-informed sources believe that the committee members are largely the same as those who investigated the bombing of Barcelona (Spain). It is reported that the committee members have arrived in Helsinki. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Attitude Towards the Soviet Union to Undergo Major Decision, Political Circles Believe Change is Possible, Calls for Military Aid to Finland are Rising</h3>
<p>London - Political figures here recently stated that Britain and France have already decided to actively assist Finland within the scope permitted by neutrality. Therefore, while dealing with the war in Western Europe, they are also conserving military supplies as much as possible to support Finland. However, after the Red Army's continued progress in the Karelian Isthmus, Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union may change. Although there is no information to confirm this, most people believe that only by going to war with the Soviet Union can Finland be effectively assisted. Former War Minister Hore-Belisha recently published an article in the "World News Report," and The Times also published a special article on the 20th of last month, stating that Britain and France may not be able to tolerate the Soviet Union's assistance to Germany for long. Later, General Gough, the former commander of the Fifth British Army, also published an article stating that intervening in the Finnish-Soviet war to oppose the Soviet Union is indeed advisable. The "Nineteenth Century Monthly" further believes that this is essential for Britain and France to achieve victory. In addition, the "Time and Tide" magazine also expressed its agreement. Although the morning papers have not stated their position, they all reported that the current European war may expand to the Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, or Norway. As for the Labour Party, opinions are still very divided on this matter. Several members of the party recently inspected the Finnish front line and, upon their return, advocated a strong anti-Soviet movement, but due to the opposition of most party members, it could not be put into practice. In short, the British government must make an important decision based on military, strategic, and moral considerations. Although British public opinion does not want the current European war to expand and go to war with the Soviet Union, if new events occur that provide a reason for actively assisting Finland, then the majority of the people will be willing to accept it, even if it means going to war with the Soviet Union.

<h3>Son of Former US President Joins Finnish War, Commands British Volunteers, Swiss Rescue Team Goes to Finland</h3>
<p>London - According to the Aid Finland Office, the British War Office has approved Kermit Roosevelt, the son of former US President Theodore Roosevelt and a relative of the current US President, to resign from his position in the British Army.

One person jumped out with a parachute, suffered severe injuries, and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>London - Aviation sources said that a British plane again went to Berlin last night for reconnaissance. Although it was fired upon by German anti-aircraft batteries, it was still able to calmly distribute leaflets and then encountered enemy planes, but there was no contact. After completing its mission, it returned safely to its base, taking a total of ten hours. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Officials announced last night that four German planes and twelve French fighters engaged in a fierce air battle southeast of Diedenhofen. The two sides fought for a long time.

<h3>German Naval Chief Broadcasts Respect for US Neutrality, Specifies Targets for Attacking Merchant Ships, US Warns Captains Not to Approach Allied Ports</h3>
<p>Berlin - Naval Minister Admiral Raeder delivered a broadcast speech last night, answering the question from Dr. Jordan, the European representative of the US National Broadcasting Company, namely, "Will naval warfare endanger American shipping?" Raeder declared, "Germany will respect President Roosevelt's neutrality policy of the United States. The German Navy has been ordered to pay close attention to American ships it encounters and avoid any adverse effects." Raeder stated, "The British blockade policy against Germany, which expands the scope of contraband, is tantamount to waging war against the entire German people. Therefore, Germany also has the obligation to use the same methods to retaliate against them, so that goods designated as contraband by Britain cannot reach England. Germany will only take certain actions against merchant ships under the following three circumstances: (1) armed merchant ships; (2) merchant ships escorted by warships or aircraft; (3) merchant ships hired for naval service. The above three types all lose their civilian nature and are the target of the German Navy to attack." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US Department of Commerce has issued another instruction warning captains of North American ships not to call at Allied ports, and to adhere to North American neutrality. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - News from the capital of Uruguay states that major shipping companies in the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, have now decided to refuse to load goods directly bound for the United Kingdom, but goods bound for Amsterdam will continue to be loaded as usual, but the freight will be increased, so the price of goods will rise again.

<h3>For Violation of Neutrality, Germany Apologizes to Belgium, Says Planes Crossed Border Due to Misunderstanding, Willing to Compensate for Loss of Shot Down Belgian Plane</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German government issued an official statement last night as follows: "On March 2, a German reconnaissance plane, on its way back after completing reconnaissance in northern France, was pursued by seven British 'Hurricane' fighters. The German pilot believed that he was in French airspace and that the planes he encountered were British planes, so he pursued them, resulting in the shooting down of a 'Hurricane' fighter. It returned safely. After investigation, it was learned that the place where the air battle occurred was in Belgian airspace on the border between France and Belgium, and that the shot down plane was a Belgian fighter of the British 'Hurricane' type. The Belgian ambassador to Germany visited the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, and the German authorities expressed their regrets." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Brussels - Regarding the German plane invading Belgian airspace and shooting down a Belgian plane, according to official sources, the German government has acknowledged the mistake. The German ambassador to Belgium visited the Belgian Foreign Minister today, explained the German government's views, and expressed regret. In the future, the regulations prohibiting aircraft of belligerent countries from flying over the airspace of neutral countries will be absolutely observed. As for Belgium's request for compensation for losses, it is also willing to consider it. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Brussels - Officials announced that yesterday several planes of unknown nationality were flying in Belgian airspace, and Belgian anti-aircraft guns opened fire.

Last week, leaflets issued by Germany were mailed to Belgium, and today a pamphlet printed in Hamburg entitled "Politics" was discovered, which vehemently criticized Britain. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Indian Ship Sunk in English Channel, Two British Ships Hit Mines, Dutch Freighter Also Straffed</h3>
<p>London - According to a British Admiralty communiqué, at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. on March 2, under a dim moon, two German bombers attacked the British-Indian merchant ship Dumana (8,441 tons) in the English Channel and dropped four bombs. Three bombs hit, the captain died, and the ship caught fire. The sea was dangerous, making rescue difficult. Although most of the passengers and crew were rescued by several British ships and a Dutch ship, 20 of the 48 British people on board were missing, and 88 of the 253 Indian people were missing, and are feared dead. Many of those rescued were also injured. This merchant ship had departed from Antwerp, Belgium. Among the British-Indian passengers it carried, 143 had previously been released by the German government. A casualty list is currently being compiled and will be notified to their families as soon as possible. The ship is now docked in the port. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London - Authorities issued a statement saying that the Dumana carried a total of 295 people, and a total of 100 were missing, including 19 European crew members, 36 Indian sailors, and 45 Indian passengers. The ship carried a total of 143 Indian passengers. Only two female servants were among the missing, and it is believed that they died immediately after the explosion. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Port of Ostend, Belgium - The Dutch freighters "Limborg" and "Aschland," which were loaded with coal from Newcastle, England, were strafed by German planes in the North Sea and suffered considerable damage. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Athens Sinking Case Litigated in US, US Demands Compensation for Losses of Passengers Killed</h3>
<p>Washington - The British ship Athens, which sank in a mysterious explosion at the beginning of the European war, with 120 American passengers drowned, has now reportedly demanded US$700,000 in compensation from the British shareholders. The filing of this request allows the bereaved families of the deceased to resort to law to resolve the greatest mystery at sea in this war, namely, what was the true cause of the sinking of the Athens. Churchill claimed that the British Navy had obtained evidence that the German submarines were responsible for the incident, but the Germans said it was at Churchill's direction, that Churchill wanted to involve the United States in the vortex of the world war, and therefore deliberately created a second Lusitania incident. The representative of the claimants is George Natanson, an international lawyer from Washington. According to Natanson, the Federal Court in New York will be asked to determine who is responsible for the disaster, because neither the White Star Line nor the Donaldson Company has indicated any intention of settling out of court. As for the shareholders of the Athens, they said that since the blame lies with the Germans, they have no responsibility for the safety of the passengers. Natanson also said that at the beginning of the incident, he believed Churchill's words were true, and believed that the British Naval Intelligence Agency would disclose concrete evidence, but six months have passed, and no evidence has been presented to confirm Churchill's statement, so that the bereaved families of the deceased have the impression that the British Navy may have an unspeakable secret and may be hiding the evidence. Natanson continued, "Most of my clients sympathize with the Allied Powers, but they believe that if this matter was really done by the Germans, then the British Navy should have been able to confirm the Germans' guilt long ago within this long period of six months." According to reporters, some officials in the State Department also consider Britain's actions to be suspicious, because the State Department asked the British Admiralty about the nature of the cargo on the Athens and the condition of the boilers, but has not received a satisfactory response. The claimants in the Athens case can represent the American public, and it is heard that their plan is to invite anyone who can shed a ray of light on revealing the truth of the accident to appear in court for interrogation.

<h3>Old Men Dominate British Politics, British Newspaper Points Out Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Hague - The British Sunday Review, a widely circulated newspaper, published an article yesterday pointing out that the ages of key figures in British politics are too high and lack the ability to win victories. For example, former Prime Minister George is 77 years old, current Prime Minister Chamberlain is 70 years old, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon is 67 years old, Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield is 66 years old, Naval Minister Churchill is 65 years old, Minister without Portfolio Lord Hankey is 62 years old, and Lord Privy Seal Lord Hailsham is younger at 58 years old. As for Secretary of State for War Stanley, at 44 years old, he is just a "little brother" in the eyes of the elders in the British wartime cabinet. Dutch business leaders discussed this article today, saying that this situation is even more prominent in British business circles. When the British famous "Great Western Railway Company" holds board meetings, most of those present are old men over 80 years old, and those in their 70s are regarded as juniors. None of the directors used by the management are under 75 years old. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Ningbo Organizations Rush to Handle Aftermath of Jing Sheng Ferry Tragedy, Ningxian Government Organizes Aftermath Committee, Hires Divers to Retrieve Bodies in Ningbo, Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association Sends 10,000 Yuan to Assist with Relief</h3>
<p>The Jing Sheng ferry, a Ningbo barge, which was carrying passengers from the Moufu steamship from Benbo to Zhenhai outside the harbor, suddenly capsized the other day, causing a tragic incident. All parties are quite concerned about this. The Ningxian County Government has organized an aftermath committee and allocated funds to provide compensation to the passengers who died in the disaster. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association held an executive and supervisory meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss relief measures. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Moufu Steamer Crew Reports Details</p>
<p>The Moufu steamer arrived in Shanghai at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. According to the Moufu steamer crew who witnessed the capsizing and sinking of the Jing Sheng ferry, the Jing Sheng ferry left Ningbo at 7:00 AM on the 2nd, carrying over 250 passengers, to board the Moufu steamer bound for Shanghai outside Zhenhai harbor. At 1:50 PM, it carried over 300 passengers from the Deping steamer, which had arrived in Zhenhai from Shanghai, back to Ningbo. At that time, it was during a Japanese air raid, and the Ningbo air defense command issued an emergency alert. The Deping passengers disembarked one after another, and the second group of Moufu passengers on the dock also swarmed onto the Jing Sheng ferry. The ship's pilot was about to turn around and head to the opposite bank to temporarily avoid the air raid when it was surrounded by forty or fifty sampans. Over 200 passengers climbed aboard the Jing Sheng from the port side, and the passengers on board, fearing a repeat of the recent tragic bombing of the Zhenxin ferry between Ningbo and Yao by Japanese aircraft, were panicked and disorderly. The Jing Sheng ferry tilted too much and immediately began to sink. Within only three minutes, it had completely disappeared into the water, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. The passengers all sank with the ferry. After salvage efforts, eleven bodies have been recovered, but all of them were beyond resuscitation despite being sent to Zhongzheng Huamei and other hospitals for treatment due to being in the water for too long. All the bodies have been moved to the Siming Public Hall for relatives to identify.</p>
<p>Partial List of Deceased Passengers</p>
<p>The list of bodies recovered in the past two days is listed below. Eleven bodies from the previous two days: (1) Yin Chang'an, male, 48 years old, residing at 6 Shishu Bridge.

<p>Salvage of Bodies and Beginning of Aftermath</p>
<p>The Ningbo Barge Transportation Company, in order to actively salvage the bodies that have not yet been found, telegraphed the Moufu Steamer Shipping Department in Shanghai yesterday to find a way to hire divers to go to Ningbo to salvage them. The manager of the steamer, Zhu Meixian, hired three divers to take a special tugboat this morning, carrying salvage equipment, directly to Ningbo. It is reported that all the staff and crew of the Moufu Steamer were safe in this Jing Sheng ferry capsizing. However, there were seven relatives of Song Zhenfu, the chef in the steamer's kitchen, who were originally planning to take the Moufu Steamer to Shanghai for a wedding. They boarded the Jing Sheng ferry at the time. According to subsequent investigations, all seven are missing and presumed dead, which is also tragic. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Ningxian County Government, in addition to ordering the speedy salvage of the bodies that have not yet been found, has also jointly organized an aftermath committee with relevant agencies and local organizations. The personnel have already been decided, with Yu Jimin, the county magistrate of Ningxian, serving as the chairman, and Zhang Guiling, the deputy commander of the Ningbo garrison, and Zhou Dalie, the general manager of the Ningbo Barge Transportation Company, serving as the vice-chairmen. The committee held its first meeting in Ningbo the day before yesterday and decided to allocate 10,000 yuan to handle all aftermath matters. The committee will provide compensation to the deceased passengers based on the circumstances, is currently investigating the names of the deceased, and notifying their families to identify them. The committee notified the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association yesterday by telegram (text omitted).</p>

Regarding the living allowance, it has been decided to increase it from the current 10% to 30%. The current rice subsidy method has been changed to allow each person to purchase half a shi of rice per month at a price of 15 yuan. Regardless of how high the price of rice rises, all losses will be borne by the company. This is a satisfactory solution. We hope that all workers will work with peace of mind. Respectfully, Yu Qiaqing."</p>
<p>Labor Side Expresses Gratitude to All Sectors</p>
<p>A representative of the labor side told the Daguan News Agency reporter after the negotiations ended, "This time, all the workers of the Public Bus Company, unable to bear the pressure of living, put forward conditions for improved treatment to the company authorities.

All the workers express their deep gratitude. We have now decided to abide by the advice of Mr. Yu and the Concession authorities, work with peace of mind, and strive to serve the transportation work, so as not to fail the kindness of all parties."</p>
<h3>Another Assassination Case Yesterday, Wu Qilun Shot Dead, Wu, a Lawyer, Frequently Visited Entertainment Venues, Suddenly Assassinated at Home Yesterday Morning by Violent Attackers</h3>
<p>At 11:10 AM yesterday noon, an assassination case suddenly occurred at No. 3 Qinyi Lane, Tongfu Road, Public Concession. The victim was Wu Qilun, a lawyer in this city, who was shot three times on the spot, injuring vital parts, and died immediately. The murderer escaped without a trace. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Unexpected Guests Arrive at the Office</p>
<p>Wu Qilun is from Guanyun, Jiangsu, 42 years old this year, also known as Shuyi, and is a lawyer. He has an office at No. 3, Alley 102, Tongfu Road. The upstairs is his residence. The house has two buildings and two lower levels. In addition to renting out the remaining houses, he lives in the rest himself. At about 11:00 AM yesterday noon, Wu was working in the office in the east wing. At that time, an unexpected guest arrived and knocked on the door. The maid opened the door and invited the guest in, who went straight to Wu's office.</p>
<p>Three Shots Fired, All Hitting Vital Parts</p>
<p>Upon seeing Wu Qilun inside, without asking anything, the guest took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired three shots at Wu. One bullet hit his waist, one hit his head, and one hit his right arm. The sound of the shots was like a string of pearls. Wu fell to the ground in response, blood gushing out. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately rushed out of the door and fled.</p>
<p>Died in Hospital Due to Excessive Blood Loss</p>
<p>Before the tragedy occurred, Wu's niece, Zhaohua, happened to be in the office and was just entering the back room when she suddenly heard gunshots. Looking back, she saw that Wu had been injured and was lying in a pool of blood, and the murderer had already left. Shocked, she shouted for help. Family members and neighbors gathered upon hearing the sound, and the Chengdu Road Police Station was immediately notified, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate. An ambulance was summoned and Wu was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he was too severely injured and lost too much blood. He died shortly after, and his body was transferred to the coroner's office and reported to the court to send personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>General Speculation on the Inside Story of the Case</p>
<p>Regarding Wu's assassination, it is generally speculated that it was of a political nature, but the truth is difficult to ascertain at this time. Wu's first wife was the younger sister of Pu Yi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, named Jing Huifang. Later, they divorced for some reason, and Jing changed her name to Wang in Shanghai and became a female guide. Wu frequently visited singing and dancing halls.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Again, Rice Prices Expected to Decline, Over 79,000 Bags Have Arrived</h3>
<p>The source of foreign rice is abundant, so there is hope that rice prices in this city will decline. Over the past two days, over 79,000 bags have arrived. The Hualun Foreign Company's Dapu steamer brought 16,627 bags of No. 1 foreign rice and 12,654 bags of No. 2 foreign rice directly from Saigon, totaling 26,281 bags. It is reported that No. 2 foreign rice is subsidized rice, which arrived in Shanghai at about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (3rd) and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Unloading began yesterday morning.</p>
<p>More Large Amounts of贡米 Arriving Continuously</p>
<p>The Yisheng steamer of the Jardine Matheson Foreign Company imported 5,335 bags from Haiphong and 2,518 bags from Hong Kong yesterday morning, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession for unloading. The Wil Ford (Meifu) of the Danish firm捷成 Foreign Company also imported over 30,000 bags from Saigon at 11:40 AM yesterday noon, docking at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that the irregular ship of the United States Post Steamship Company also loaded over 35,000 bags from Saigon, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but due to bad weather, it had not been imported as of 6:30 PM. It is expected to arrive this morning and is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. A large amount of foreign rice is on its way.</p>
<p>New Pharmaceutical Industry Plans to Aid the Poor</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, in view of the recent soaring prices of all goods, especially food and fuel, which has made it increasingly difficult for the poor to make a living, specially convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members to discuss remedial measures. As a result, it was decided to jointly form a temporary assistance committee for the poor with the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, raise funds to assist, and publicly recommend Xu Guanqun to draft an organizational outline, and actively raise donations separately.</p>
<h3>Coal Reserves Replenished, 500,000 to 600,000 Tons in Storage, Purchase Prices Trending Lower, Approximately 100,000 Tons of Anthracite Coal Blocks Also Sold, Warnings Issued Against Raising Prices and Selling Coal Balls</h3>
<p>The entire fuel problem in Shanghai has been caused by the control of spot goods, resulting in soaring anthracite coal prices. However, the source of coal blocks has not been interrupted. According to inquiries from the Jianghai Customs, a total of 201,852 tons of coal blocks were imported in January of this year, valued at 1,273,420 gold, equivalent to 3,446,396 national currency, with the largest amount coming from Japan, accounting for 50,917 tons, valued at 169,052 gold, followed by Annam, accounting for 42,546 tons, valued at 270,882 gold. Only 70 tons were sent to foreign countries, valued at 43 gold. Therefore, there is no shortage of fuel needed daily by Shanghai citizens, whether it is anthracite coal blocks or coal dust and charcoal. The market price is gradually trending downward, and citizens' concerns can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Coal Block Transactions</p>
<p>Regarding the reserves of coal blocks in Shanghai, according to sources, they are indeed very substantial, with approximately 500,000 to 600,000 tons stockpiled in various warehouses in Pudong, and their purchase prices have slightly decreased. They have been continuously arriving in Shanghai in recent days. According to news from the coal industry in this city yesterday, approximately 100,000 tons of anthracite coal blocks from India and Annam have been contracted for delivery by telegram. It is reported that they will be shipped to Shanghai from the above-mentioned producing areas in the middle of this month for adjustment. It is hoped that all coal companies and firms will not hoard spot goods in coal warehouses, so that speculators will not be able to use their skills.</p>
<p>Door-to-Door Sales Situation</p>
<p>The door-to-door sales price of coal balls has been limited to no more than 5.80 yuan per hundred catties, with an additional two jiao for delivery. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and related organizations and companies have announced that all coal and charcoal shops in the city must comply. The Zhongxiangtai Coal Shop on Laobeimen Street in the French Concession sold two loads of coal balls and charged 6.20 yuan per load, violating the publicly set price. It has now been reported, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, considering that this is the first time the incident has occurred, has transferred a letter to the shop, giving it a stern warning and strictly correcting it. The subsidized sale of coal balls was on its third day yesterday, and the situation in each location was the same as the previous day. However, the weather was not good, and it rained lightly all day, causing the civilians who bought coal balls to get wet all over. However, the order was still well-maintained. The 27th subsidized sales location of the Xiexing Coal Shop at No. 270恺自 Road in the French Concession handled it for the first time yesterday, and it was also very crowded. According to the Coal Ball Association yesterday, it will continue to handle the subsidized sale of coal balls as much as possible. It also said that the Xiexing Coal Shop has no intention of refusing to sell coal balls.</p>
<p>Information on the Cooked Water Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association, in order to discuss the entire fuel problem of the industry, has scheduled a temporary general meeting of all members for 9:00 AM today at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. The meeting order and the presidium have been determined internally. The agenda items are: (1) How to resolve the coal shortage problem for the industry. (2) Compliance with the water price stipulated in the association's articles of association to ensure uniformity. (3) The association's collection of membership fees will be based on the official receipt issued by the personnel designated by the association. (4) How to raise funds to address the association's financial difficulties. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Kui Yanfang, He Dekui, and other gentlemen have been invited by the industry, and it is reported that they will attend and provide guidance, and a letter has been sent to the police authorities requesting them to send police to protect the meeting to avoid accidents.</p>

<h3>Snatching People in Hongkou, Fish Prices Soar, Fishmongers Dare Not Go to the Fish Market, All Switch to Buying from the 16th Wharf</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury says that after the Japanese authorities repeatedly forcibly grabbed Chinese residents in Hongkou, fishmongers south of the Suzhou Creek today (4th) expressed their extreme reluctance to go to the Japanese fish market in Yangshupu to buy fish, for fear of being arrested even if they have proper permits. Although a few fishmongers still go to the fish market, most have switched to buying goods from the fish market at the 16th Wharf, causing fish prices in this city to soar. It is now reported that the Chinese who were arrested by the Japanese authorities since February 14 were not taken to Taiwan, but were escorted to the蕴藻浜 area to build a car road. The Japanese authorities' new declaration yesterday criticized the newspaper's report that the Japanese were rounding up Chinese in Hongkou, and Randolph denied "the unfounded rumors promoted by Chongqing." However, according to reliable sources, many Chinese have been snatched in Hongkou in the past two weeks.</p>
<h3>Jewish Immigrants, Relocation Dispute, Most People Unwilling, Now Postponed for One Week</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that about 130 European Jewish immigrants in the Ward Road shelter refused to comply with the order to move into the Pingliang Road shelter last Saturday and Sunday, causing a minor commotion, resulting in one person being slightly injured and treated.</p>
<p>The events were as follows: The Shanghai Jewish Refugee Committee notified the refugees in the Ward Road shelter aged 30 to 55 a few days ago that they should move into the Pingliang Road shelter, so as to leave space for younger refugees. About an hour after lunch last Saturday and Sunday, a committee member asked the immigrants to pack their bags, but most of the immigrants said they were unwilling to leave, resulting in a dispute and commotion, resulting in an injury to a committee member. It is also rumored that this disturbance was caused by about 100 immigrants who were eating in the shelter opposing the increase in meal fees from 10 yuan to 22 yuan. However, the dispute quickly ended, and the shelter staff expected that the shelter would continue to be in an uproar yesterday. It is reported that the police department has been asked to assist in suppressing the situation in the event of a disturbance, but the committee has decided to postpone the relocation order for one week, so there has been no further disturbance.</p>
<h3>Customs Tax Police and Others Expected to Receive Pay Raise</h3>
<p>Over a thousand tax police and other unranked employees in all departments of the Jianghai Customs, because of the rapid increase in living expenses, sent representatives to see the tax commissioner on the 18th of last month, requesting that the order limiting the amount of rice subsidies be withdrawn and that a temporary living allowance be added. The authorities expressed great sympathy, knowing that it is currently difficult to maintain a living, and the authorities have forwarded the request to the General Tax Office for approval. In addition to requesting that the order be withdrawn, it is also recommended that a temporary living allowance of 40% be added so that they can work with peace of mind and maintain the status quo. It is now reported that the request is likely to be approved and will be approved before the end of this month before the salaries are paid.</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation Still Severe in North China, All Parties Continue to Raise Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>American Advisory Committee Continues to Allocate 200,000 Yuan for Relief. Last year's floods in North China affected the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Puyang, with tens of millions of victims, a disaster unprecedented in history. International charities in Shanghai have raised funds for relief. According to the investigation by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, relief work cannot stop for a day before this year's autumn harvest. Especially at this time, it is more important to loan money to farmers for spring plowing. After the disaster, if spring plowing is abandoned again, it will be even more difficult to continue in the future. The American China Disaster Advisory Committee in this city has specially allocated 200,000 yuan for relief the other day and entrusted the Beijing church organizations to handle the relief, focusing on assisting spring plowing. In addition, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and others are reported to be continuing to raise funds for relief.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Power Declines, Market Situation Sluggish, Citizens All Embrace the View of Saving What Can Be Saved, The Only Way to Save It Is to Suppress and Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>Companies and firms in all industries made profits last year because prices rose step by step. The more inventory they had, the thicker the profits they estimated. After entering the spring of this year, the price涨风 trend became even more intense, so most citizens could not bear it and lost their purchasing power. According to the investigation by the reporter, after the lunar new year settlement, the business volume of wholesale and retail stores in the industries of cloth, silk, leather, clothing, and department stores is not what it used to be. The vast majority of citizens are threatened by high prices and have embraced the attitude of saving what can be saved, resulting in the accumulation of goods and a gradual decline in sales. This is a clear example of the gradual impact of the loss of public purchasing power on various industries. In addition, although hotels, restaurants, and theaters have maintained prosperity in consumption due to the large population, according to those who are familiar with the inside story, the cost of a meal is often dozens of gold, and even a simple drink is quite expensive. Therefore, the situation is not what it used to be. Those who care about prices and the market all hope that the abnormal prices can be adjusted quickly, and at the same time, increase the treatment of employees as much as possible to cultivate their purchasing power. The direct beneficiaries are still the industries themselves. If this is not done, the higher the prices and the more purchasing power decreases, the consumers, sellers, and producers will perish together.</p>

<h3>Xueyuan Manager Yuan Zhizhuang Was Kidnapped Yesterday. Three Bandits Entered Xueyuan and Abducted Yuan. The Reason for Yuan's Kidnapping, Despite Not Being Wealthy, Is Unknown.</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 8:00 PM, a kidnapping case occurred on Jing'an Temple Road. The kidnapped person was the manager of the well-known Xueyuan Restaurant. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The History of Xueyuan</p>
<p>The Xueyuan Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road was founded by the famous amateur opera singer Yao Shaohua. It has been in business for many years. All of the restaurant's food is based on the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang style. It was originally located in the lane next to the China United Assurance Society. Although the scale was not very large, the business was extremely prosperous due to its meticulous production and capable chefs. Moreover, most of the customers were upper-class people.</p>
<p>Capable Manager</p>
<p>Last summer, the restaurant expanded its premises and moved from China United to the new building at No. 1225 Jing'an Temple Road, next to the Cangzhou Hotel. The position of manager has always been held by Yuan Zhizhuang (51 years old), a local. Mr. Yuan is skilled in social interaction and handles matters capably. Xueyuan's success today is entirely due to Mr. Yuan's efforts.</p>
<p>Three Bandits</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan lives at No. 2, Lane 169, Luban Road in the French Concession. He has accumulated some savings through diligence and thrift, but he has been coveted by bandits. At around 8:20 PM last night, three bandits dressed in Zhongshan suits, each wielding a handgun, burst into the manager's office of Xueyuan. Mr. Yuan was inside settling accounts at the time. When the three bandits saw Mr. Yuan inside, they immediately stepped forward and threatened him with their guns.</p>
<p>Abducted and Driven Away</p>
<p>At the time, Mr. Yuan knew that things were not good, but seeing that the bandits were armed with guns, he had no way to resist and had to let the bandits abduct him. He was dragged out and driven away in a car brought by the bandits. Although there were many people in the restaurant at the time, they dared not rashly call the police for Mr. Yuan's safety. Afterward, they urgently reported to the police.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>The police immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and found one of Mr. Yuan's shoes on the road near Hardoon Garden, which was taken to the police station for investigation. At the same time, a large number of police cars were dispatched to patrol the area, but to no avail. The police are currently investigating the reason for Mr. Yuan's abduction. However, according to general predictions, everyone believes that Mr. Yuan is not very wealthy and is not qualified to be kidnapped. If we observe the clothing of the three bandits, there may be other reasons, which is unknown.</p>

With the approval of the Supreme Court, it was designated to remain under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the case has been concluded and the verdict was announced yesterday. Ju Bailu was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news about fines for violating weights and measures published in the Local News section of your newspaper on March 2nd, the oil jugs in our store are purchased from a manufacturer specializing in weights and measures and have a stamping mark verifying their standards. When using them, we measure the net amount of oil to be 14 city taels and set the price accordingly. On January 28th, the French Municipal Police checked and determined that the volume was insufficient, violating the weights and measures regulations. At that time, we explained that the selling price that day was 84 cents per jug. If calculated according to the market price per catty, it should be sold for 1 yuan and 13 cents, a difference of more than 20 cents from our selling price. This is because our oil prices are calculated based on cost. Oil is a sacrificial product among the goods we sell, so the price is low and has been praised by all. We have been envied by our competitors as a result. However, we only focus on setting prices based on the actual quantity and are truly unaware of violating weights and measures regulations. The report in your newspaper stated that the oil scoops were filled with lead at the bottom for illegal profit, which does not match the facts of the case. Because this concerns our reputation, we are sending this letter to correct the record. We hope that you will publish it accordingly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Fuxing Sauce and Wine Shop</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Positions Are Doubly Abundant. A Selling Wind Enveloped the Market All Day. The Spot Market Was Loose, and the Forward Market Was Even More So.</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listing remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American exchange, the situation throughout the day was loose. The spot market was particularly weak, and the further out the date, the weaker it was. As for the occurrence of the selling wind, the reasons were said to be: (1) the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other four countries gathered in Chongqing; (2) it was reported that the US President had approved a new loan of US$20 million to China. However, Sassoon once ate Weiqi Wang and aggressively absorbed US$300,000. Although it stabilized slightly, it ultimately closed at a lower price due to the emergence of speculative longs, especially in the afternoon. The opening price in the morning was average, around 4 shillings 1.125 and 6 yuan 75. Initially, there were some settlements from foreign firms, but they had no impact. Later, a certain Chinese firm on behalf of Hong Kong unexpectedly released spot US dollars, followed by favorable Dutch and other releases of US dollars for this month. Moreover, Chinese firms and a few speculators also sold, so the underlying trend was stable with a hint of firmness. The spot market was particularly weak, rising sharply by 0.03125 and 0.0625. However, Sassoon suddenly took the opportunity to aggressively absorb, in a large amount, so the downward trend stabilized slightly. After this, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and trading suddenly became quiet. Until the close, there was not much change. In the afternoon, the market initially reported a flat trend, but soon speculators came to sell again, and the outside firms were still full of selling intention, so the market dropped again. Extending to the close, it rose to 4 shillings 1.15625 and 6 yuan 8125, resulting in a jump of 0.03125 and 0.0625. The underlying trend for spot and forward British and American exchange both showed a convergence.</p>
<p>Sassoon Settled US$300,000</p>
<p>Initially, the London big strip and the prices of London spot gold and silver were all reported as unchanged. The exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French exchange, as well as US against British, Shanghai, and French exchange, were all stable. The central listing exchange rates remained as before. The opening selling prices of spot exchange by the banks in the morning were British gold at 4 shillings 1.125 and US exchange at 6 yuan 75, which were unchanged compared to the end of last week. At the same time, the opening of the forward market was also similar to Saturday. After the opening, there were small settlements from foreign firms, but the supply from outside firms was still good, so there was no impact. It is estimated that foreign firms settled spot US exchange at 6 yuan 75 with a certain bank. At the same time, HSBC stuffed a certain bank with spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125. The HSBC listing was announced as unchanged, and the white silver equalization tax was also announced as unchanged. After this, a certain Chinese bank suddenly released spot US exchange at 6 yuan 78125 to Chase Bank and Hwa Bih on behalf of Hong Kong, so the process was stable with a slight firmness. During this period, the forward market also rose slightly. This month's forward was available for purchase at 4 shillings 0.078125 and 6 yuan 65625, and next month's forward was available at 4 shillings 0.015625 and 6 yuan 53125. Later, the favorable Dutch and other outside firms released more US dollars for this month, and Chinese firms and speculators also released them, so the positions were doubly abundant, causing the spot market to continue to weaken. However, the Western firm Sassoon suddenly took the opportunity to aggressively grab, absorbing a total of about 300,000 yuan in US dollars for this month's forward, at an average price of 6 yuan 6875, and settling a small amount of British gold for this month at a price of 4 shillings 0.09375. At that time, next month's forward also rose to 4 shillings 0.03125 and 6 yuan 5625 available. After 10:00 AM, both buyers and sellers suddenly watched from the sidelines, so the transaction suddenly turned quiet, and the market became stagnant. Until the close, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125, US exchange was 6 yuan 75, British gold for this month was 4 shillings 0.09375, US exchange was 6 yuan 6875, British gold for next month was 4 shillings 0.03125, and US exchange was 6 yuan 5625. Compared to the opening in the morning, the spot market was unchanged, and the spot market rose slightly by 0.03125 and 0.0625.</p>
<p>British and American Spot and Futures Converged</p>
<p>The state of the aftermarket initially remained calm, but spot continued to be slightly softer. Afterward, due to the continued efforts of Chinese merchants who had been long for spot, plus outside firms with favorable positions still willing to sell, the spot was soft up to 4 shillings 1.140625 and 6 yuan 78125 available around 3 p.m. Later, Chinese merchants continued to provide foreign firms with spot for the month at 6 yuan 71875 and 75, while foreign firms did US exchange between them for April at 6 yuan 6875, and money changers sold US dollar bills to Hwa Bih at 6 yuan 875. Therefore, the process was even softer. Extending to the close, British gold was 4 shillings 1.25625, US exchange was 6 yuan 8125, British gold for this month was 4 shillings 1.125, US exchange was 6 yuan 75, British gold for next month was 4 shillings 0.078125, US exchange was 6 yuan 65625. The result compared to last weekend was British gold at a spot market of long 0.03125, US at a soft market of 0.0625, spot British at spot loose market of 0.0625, US at a low market of 125, monthly British forward long market was 0.078125, US soft market of 0.15625</p>

<h3>Establishment of Sino-American Loans - Gold Market Sees a Wave of Selling - Approaching the 4,700 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "烚赤" (slang for spot gold) market was bleak, with the downward trend intensifying and unbearable to look back on. It had already broken through the 4,800 Yuan mark. This was mainly because the bearish rumors from last weekend's market had not dissipated. Furthermore, reports indicated that the U.S. President had approved a massive loan to China. With the spot exchange market also easing on the day, there was a continuous stream of sellers. In the afternoon, gold shops and securities firms competed even more fiercely to sell. Although Hong Kong firms attempted to buy in mid-session, they ultimately failed to reverse the downward trend. The opening price in the morning immediately plummeted 12 Yuan, to 4,790 Yuan. Soon after, money changers and others rushed to sell, while foreign exchange futures strengthened, leading to another drop of 15 Yuan. Later, a certain gold shop and a certain silver store suddenly bought heavily on behalf of Hong Kong firms. At that time, the foreign exchange market reported a turn to stability, briefly stabilizing and rebounding to a peak of 4,792 Yuan. However, this was followed by the cessation of buying interest from Hong Kong firms, coupled with renewed competition from money changers and retail investors to sell. The morning closing price was only 4,779 Yuan. The afternoon initially seemed stable, but soon saw another decline, as a certain gold shop and securities firms sold a large amount. Although Hong Kong firms again came to buy in between, they still felt the pressure of abundant supply, and prices once retreated to a low of 4,715 Yuan. Fortunately, a certain silver bank took advantage of the low prices to buy back in, slightly recovering by over 10 Yuan, to close at 4,733 Yuan. As a result, it fell by 69 Yuan compared to the end of last week, with a total of about 2,800 taels traded throughout the day. Silver store jewelry was listed down by 5 Yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Current Status of Implementation of Compulsory Education in Zhejiang Province (II)</h3>
<p>Regulations have been established and promulgated regarding the custody and withdrawal procedures for compulsory education funds, with particular attention paid to the storage of dedicated funds to ensure their independence. Surplus annual funds must be included in the next year's budget and are not allowed to be used for other purposes. However, some county governments still use the name of unified collection and expenditure to actually donate and appropriate funds. Therefore, there are two points regarding this issue that are worthy of discussion: (1) Should a special accounting system be implemented for education funds? (2) How should we prevent and correct the abuse of arbitrary misappropriation? If these two issues can be thoroughly resolved, the independence of compulsory education funds will be guaranteed in fact.</p>
<p>(III) Teacher Training Not only is there a perceived "quantitative deficiency" in compulsory education teachers in the province, but also a "qualitative" one. It is imperative to provide appropriate training to incumbent short-term primary school teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills. In the 25th year (of the Republic), measures for training short-term primary school teachers in various counties and cities were formulated and promulgated. Twenty-six counties and cities, including Hangzhou, complied with these measures, with a total of 1,001 people receiving training (excluding the number of people in five counties that were not reported). The subjects were freely determined by the counties and cities based on their needs and submitted to the Provincial Department for approval. The training period ranged from a minimum of two weeks to a maximum of one month. The Provincial Department, fearing that counties with financial and human resource difficulties would be unable to hold training, also specially formulated measures for joint provincial and county short-term primary school teacher training to remedy this. Five locations were established that year, with trainees nominated by designated counties, totaling 705 people. The duration was three weeks, with subjects divided into eleven types, including spiritual lectures, an overview of compulsory education, teaching methods for short-term primary school Chinese language, teaching methods for short-term primary school arithmetic, implementation methods for short-term primary school civic training, teaching methods for short-term primary school inter-class exercises, small administrative affairs, child psychology, promotion of education, and the province's policy guidelines. Each also included a short-term primary school class for trainees to observe and practice. The effect was quite significant.</p>
<p>(IV) Experimentation and Supervision Short-term compulsory education is a newly created undertaking, and there are naturally many matters requiring experimentation in teaching, management, and administration. Since the second semester of the 24th year (of the Republic), the province has designated six primary schools affiliated with provincial schools to undertake this experimental research work. The implementation items include the experimentation and revision of the provisional curriculum standards and textbooks for short-term primary schools, the experimentation of the two-part system in ordinary primary schools, the experimentation of cost-effective teaching aids and other equipment, the problems of short-term primary school enrollment and retention, the concurrent implementation of one or two practical and effective social improvement activities, and the experimentation of various teaching methods, totaling more than ten items. Detailed reports were submitted to the Provincial Department one after another, and after review, they were introduced to various counties for reference in order to improve. Supervision occupies a very important position in educational administration, but it must have fixed personnel to be effective. In particular, the promotion of compulsory education requires universality, and the establishment of short-term primary school classes is very scattered. The original supervisory personnel of the Provincial Department were few in number and burdened with many tasks, making it difficult to take care of them. Therefore, from the 25th year (of the Republic), two compulsory education supervisors were specially appointed in order to improve the effectiveness of compulsory education implementation.</p>

<h3>Appointed as Commissioner in Hong Kong to Supervise Chinese Education in Hong Kong</h3>

<h3>A Study of Macau</h3>
<p>Maritime trade between the South Seas and China began in the Han Dynasty, and the establishment of a customs office in Guangzhou dates back to the Tang Dynasty. These facts are clearly documented in historical records. As for the arrival of European nations, Portugal was the first. The Portuguese settlement in Macau began during the Ming Dynasty. According to Xu Song's "Brief Overview of the World," European countries had little contact with other lands after the Age of Exploration. The Portuguese were skilled in arithmetic, astronomy, and used instruments to measure sunrise and sunset, as well as the degrees of celestial bodies. They knew the directions and distances of land and sea. In the early Ming Dynasty, their king sent skilled sailors to navigate large ships southward, traveling west along the coast of Africa, then east, passing the eastern coast of Africa, reaching the western coast of India, and continuing east. Wherever they went, they established ports. During the Longqing era, they arrived at Macau in Xiangshan County, Guangdong, and requested land to build houses, paying an annual rent of five taels of silver. Lin Fu, a border official, petitioned on their behalf, and permission was granted. The Portuguese then established a port in Macau, marking the beginning of trade between European nations and Guangdong. According to Ling Yaoxhou's "Shao Bian," during the Zhengde era, foreigners began to privately build houses in the bays of Macau for trade. They were later moved to Gaozhou Dianbai County. In the 14th year of the Jiajing era, Commander Huang Qing bribed his superiors and had them moved back to Macau outside the Tiger Leap Gate in southern Xiangshan County. They paid an annual tax of 20,000 francs and were allowed to build houses and cities, standing closely together, dominating the coast like a sovereign state. Over time, more and more people came, and other countries feared and avoided them, leaving Macau exclusively to the Portuguese. During the Wanli era, they destroyed Luzon, monopolized maritime profits from Fujian and Guangdong, and their power grew. In the 34th year, they built a temple six or seven zhang tall on Qingzhou Island across the water. Magistrate Zhang Dayong requested to destroy its high walls, but it was not done. The following year, scholar Lu Tinglong, who was preparing for the imperial examination in the capital, requested that all foreigners be expelled to the outer seas, returning Macau to China, but the authorities did not act on it.</p>

<h3>The True Meaning of Freedom</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The current society operates under a system of free trade. Freedom is a right that all humans should enjoy, and free trade can lead to progress through competition, which is originally a good thing. However, this current free trade system has led us into a dangerous situation of skyrocketing prices and impoverishment.</p>
<p>Freedom is good, but one person's freedom should not infringe on the freedom of others. This is the true meaning of freedom, so that everyone can enjoy true freedom.</p>
<p>The problem with the current society lies here. We have implemented a system of free trade, but we have not placed sufficient restrictions on this freedom. As a result, there is freedom to make money, freedom to speculate, freedom to hoard, freedom to manipulate, freedom to deceive, freedom to oppress, and freedom to exploit. As a result of this freedom, it has all ended up in the hands of a few, while the majority only receives the pitiful "freedom to starve."</p>
<p>If we want to put the current society on a rational path, we must first place sufficient restrictions on the freedom of trade, especially on the trade of goods that are directly related to the livelihood of the people, which should be strictly restricted and regulated. In this critical moment of poverty and exhaustion, if we do not implement restrictions on trade and plans to regulate essential goods, then our society will one day head down a path of chaos and destruction.</p>
<p>We can no longer let things take their natural course.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Stardust</h3>
<p>— Xiongsheng</p>
<p>The dust we see every day is nothing more than fine sand and soil, and most of it contains organic matter, which is different from what we see on the decks of ocean-going ships or on the snowfields of the North and South Poles. Because the oceans and the North and South Poles are places where ordinary land sand is not easily blown to, scientists have given this kind of dust a name called stardust. This stardust is magnetic and metallic. If analyzed by scientific methods, its molecules contain iron, manganese, magnesium, nickel, sulfur, lead, and other compounds. Because its mass is heavier than ordinary sand, when it falls on the surface of the ocean, it gradually sinks to the bottom and accumulates into rocks.</p>
<p>According to the research of astronomers, there are countless comets with extremely small volumes in the sky, which travel around the sun according to their fixed orbits. The length of the orbital radius varies, and the shape of the orbit is often elliptical, so it often intersects with the orbit of the Earth. On certain dates every year, when the Earth rotates to the intersection point, these comets also travel to the intersection point at this time, and then the two attract each other. However, the attraction of these comets is much weaker than the attraction of the Earth, so the attraction of the Earth will not be affected in any way, and the comets will be attracted by the Earth's attraction, and then break out of orbit and be sucked into the Earth's atmosphere. The speed of its flight to the ground is between ten and forty miles per second, and at this time, the comets and the air generate a great frictional force, generating heat and emitting light. This is what we usually see as meteors and shooting stars. These comets completely burn and decompose into fragments or powdery dust at a distance of about fifty to seventy miles from the ground. The larger ones become meteorites, and the smaller ones are as thin as needle tips, floating in the high air and gradually falling to the ground to become stardust. According to the research of astronomer Bolton, the weight of the earth increases by about 200 tons every day due to meteorites, and there are about 40 million particles of comet powder suspended in the sky every day.</p>
<p>Because the outer layer of the atmosphere often contains a large amount of solid stardust, when it is dusk, this stardust is subjected to changes in the temperature of the air, so it is attached with a large amount of water vapor, and the oblique sunlight is reflected by this vapor and reflected on the ground, becoming a brilliant glow. The evening glow is particularly obvious in October and November every year, because the amount of stardust is stronger than at other times, and the aurora of the North and South Poles is nothing more than the effect of stardust.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Seeking Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cen</p>
<p>Do not forget your self-study. Schools, books, and teachers are only there to help you; true knowledge must be sought by each individual.</p>
<p>You can gain knowledge from your own observations, experiences, reading, and conversations with others.</p>
<p>When you see a novel table of contents in a book, you should first have a reading goal in mind.</p>
<p>Concentrating your attention on several books with the same content in a period of time is easier, more convenient, and saves you time and energy than reading the same number of books with different content.</p>
<p>Pay attention to other people's conversations, you can get a lot of practical knowledge.</p>
<p>If you have knowledge that you cannot understand, or work that you cannot complete, do not be ashamed to ask others.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who can study on their own achieve much more in their reading than those who are forced to read, because they understand the reasons for reading and have definite aims and desires.</p>

<h3>Secret Laughter</h3>
<p>— Ouli</p>
<p>Since the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, it has produced many jokes. The following are some of the representative works:</p>
<p>(1) Jew and Tiger</p>
<p>One day, a tiger escaped from the Berlin Zoo and caused great terror in the countryside. The government issued a special notice, offering a reward for capturing the tiger, dead or alive.</p>
<p>Two Jews saw the notice. One of them suddenly turned pale and whispered to the other in a panic, "Let's run away quickly, lest we be shot dead."</p>
<p>The other man was a little puzzled and said, "Why? We're not tigers."</p>
<p>"I know," the other Jew said thoughtfully, "but what proof do we have?"</p>
<p>(2) Do Not Talk About Politics</p>
<p>One night, an old man was robbed and beaten on the streets of Berlin, so he shouted, "Help! Murder!" At this time, a policeman walked up to him and told the old man to stop making noise, saying, "Don't talk about politics so loudly!"</p>
<p>(3) Waiting for What?</p>
<p>One day, a man was waiting for a public bus on the streets of Berlin. A secret policeman ran up to him and asked, "What are you waiting for?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "I'm waiting for National Socialism to come to Germany."</p>
<p>(4) Eavesdropping</p>
<p>One day, Hitler and Goering were talking about state secrets in a car. When the car stopped at a red light at an intersection, a car followed behind and stopped next to it, with two people sitting in the car. At that time, one of them happened to yawn.</p>
<p>Goering saw it and immediately ordered the guards, "Arrest those two people, because they are eavesdropping on our conversation."</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Where Articles Come From</h3>
<p>— Kan Xiwen</p>
<p>Since Shanghai was occupied, the cultural and publishing industries have encountered an unprecedented low ebb, and for a time almost fell into a state of stagnation; this is certainly a pity, but for the sake of the country and the people, it is extremely appropriate to suffer such minor sacrifices. Moreover, with Shanghai's cultural resources, it is scattered in the culturally backward interior, and from the perspective of the entire country, it cannot be said to be a loss. What's more, the future of Shanghai culture is still unlimited. Therefore, we should not be discouraged by encountering such an unprecedented low ebb, but should continue to work hard.</p>
<p>But since the last two or three months, the publishing industry in Shanghai has suddenly seen a resurgence. Whether this phenomenon is good or bad, I will not try to guess at it; just from what I have seen at the newspaper stalls on the side of the road, there are so many kinds of publications, of all kinds, that it is too much to count, and even at this time when paper prices and printing materials are strangely expensive, they are all printed very beautifully and carefully, which is really admirable for their determination to serve the culture at the expense of everything.</p>
<p>There are so many publications, they can't not print black words on them, so the demand for manuscripts is also greater than the supply, and the "writers" who often like to move their pens also have more opportunities; but I don't know if this is a good opportunity?</p>
<p>In many publications, just flipping through the table of contents, I sometimes find people I am familiar with. I firmly believe that they are innocent and naive, and only write words for the impulse of expressing themselves; but I can't suppress my surprise. If I were the editor of a magazine, then after this I would have to add another consideration besides the words to the manuscripts they submit.</p>
<p>I think writing articles is certainly a very interesting thing, but writing does not necessarily mean that it must be published (although I wrote this article, it must be published), and publishing does not do any good to a writer. A rigorous writer can write articles for ten years without being willing to publish them, but once they are published, they will be a hit, and their literary name will immediately spread like wildfire. But this method is certainly not something that ordinary people can do, and we cannot use the ways of saints and sages to govern the masses; if there is no other way, then we should also consider the place of publication. This is what the ancient scholars and gentlemen called "Chu Chu", and if "Chu Chu" is not correct, then it is a blemish for life, and we should also write articles in this way, especially in this difficult era.</p>

<h3>Practical Religion (3)</h3>
<p>If God is the spirit of truth, then being religious is practicing truth in all our relationships; if God is beauty, then religion is the act of beauty; if God is love, then religion is the practice of kindness in all relationships of life. Religion must always be practical, and the great difficulty for most believers today is that they only focus on one side of religion, and it is the easiest side to practice. Some say that the Puritans of America knelt down to worship God on Sundays, but on weekdays they knelt on black people for fun. Whether this criticism is true or not, we can put it aside for the time being, but we do have many believers who sing hymns, recite scriptures, and worship God on Sundays, but forget everything by Monday. Therefore, everyone, our belief in God is related to the way we treat God's children, our brothers and sisters. The purpose of religion is not to make people arrogant, selfish, or cold, but to make people considerate, loving, sympathetic, and understanding. You may know all the doctrines and philosophies, you may burn candles to pray, sing hymns and recite scriptures, but if all this cannot lead you to do something for others, all you do is in vain. Those who are worthy of the name of Christians are not those who only love God and do nothing for God, but those who love God and treat others with the spirit of service and kindness. The German Marx has a saying, "Religion is the opium of the people." All truly knowledgeable people will never believe this. However, when you think about it, his words are not without reason, because many people come into contact with bad believers, and their lives become melancholy and crippled. Our beliefs and rituals must be closely linked to our daily lives. What we need today is not more Christians, but better Christians. Now is the time for us to practice religion.

<h3>Recent Anecdotes from the Peking and Tianjin Opera Circles: A Large Sum Stolen and Solved Without Investigation; Impersonating Famous Performers Not Uncommon</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>I received a letter from a friend in Peking and Tianjin, informing me of two recent amusing incidents in the theatrical circles of Peking and Tianjin, which are now being discussed in teahouses and restaurants. However, the newspapers do not provide detailed accounts, as these amusing incidents are also quite strange.</p>
<p>Everyone in Peking knows of "Commander Jin Bihui," who works for a certain party and travels to Peking, Tianjin, and other places beyond the Shanhai Pass. This is none other than Kawashima Yoshiko, the daughter of Prince Su of the late Qing Dynasty, who is known to the world as an extraordinary woman. Recently, Jin celebrated her birthday at her residence in Peking, with numerous guests and friends attending. Many famous performers came to offer congratulations, including a certain martial arts actor. After the banquet ended, Jin suddenly discovered that a leather suitcase was missing, containing banknotes amounting to over 40,000 yuan. A thorough search proved fruitless. On that day, the martial arts actor left early, so Jin did not suspect him. During the New Year, Jin visited her friends and relatives to thank them for their birthday wishes. When she arrived at the martial arts actor's house, only the actor's grandmother was at home. Seeing Jin, she appeared quite flustered and quickly brought out a leather suitcase, saying, "My grandson behaved badly and mistakenly brought this suitcase here the other day." It was indeed the missing item. Jin took it home and inspected it, finding over 10,000 yuan missing. That evening, the martial arts actor was performing at a certain theater and was arrested. After some intercession, the matter was dropped. However, the inside story remains a secret, and those involved are tight-lipped, suggesting that there may be other reasons. The martial arts actor is handsome and upright. Some say there was a romantic relationship, otherwise, for a famous performer to commit theft and for the case to be solved without investigation, it is truly a secret within the opera world.</p>
<p>A certain amateur opera singer in Tianjin, with a voice and manner that closely resembled Li Shengzao, recently had a whimsical idea. Knowing that a certain famous courtesan was fond of befriending famous performers, he impersonated Li Shengzao, claiming to have just arrived in Tianjin from Peking and was about to perform at a certain theater. The courtesan was deceived and, believing that Li had taken a fancy to her, tried to win him over, spending her days and nights with him. Before long, a knowledgeable person exposed the truth, and the amateur singer quietly disappeared, leaving the courtesan full of regret. Furthermore, a certain opium den recently had a customer who claimed to be Yuan Shihai, having just returned from Shanghai by boat and was about to perform at the China Grand Theater in Tianjin. Because his fee had not been paid, he repeatedly visited the den and smoked opium without paying a penny. The den owner initially did not suspect anything. One day, a customer who knew Yuan Shihai heard him claiming to be Yuan Shihai and was greatly surprised. He questioned him, and the man arrogantly acknowledged it. After being angrily challenged, it was revealed that he was an impostor trying to get free opium. The opium den owner could do nothing about it. Impersonating famous performers is not uncommon; it is truly a strange thing.</p>
<h3>On Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Yan Chengxi</p>
<p>Opera began in the Yuan Dynasty. Strictly speaking, opera evolved from lyrics. Starting with Dong Jieyuan's (Jin Dynasty) "Romance of the Western Chamber" ballad, Wang Shifu (Yuan Dynasty) was inspired to write "The Romance of the Western Chamber," which can be considered the ancestor of opera. Later, because the Mongolian dialect was difficult for southerners to understand, Gao Ming (late Yuan Dynasty) wrote "The Tale of the Pipa," which became known as Southern Opera. The division of opera into Northern and Southern styles began from this point. After the Jiajing era, Northern Opera declined to its lowest point, and Southern Opera evolved into a long-form drama called Chuanqi (romance play). During the Jiajing and Longqing periods, Chuanqi became even more popular, and writers like Liang Chenyu and Tu Long became famous for a time.</p>
<p>During the Yuan Dynasty, the singing of Northern and Southern operas already incorporated stringed instruments and clappers to some extent, but it was not formal but rather chaotic. It was not until the Ming Dynasty that Wei Liangfu of Kunshan reformed the old practices, equipped various musical instruments, and broke away from the styles of Haiyan, Yuyao, and Yiyang, transforming it into a kind of opera with strict vocal rules, complete musical colors, and not limited to regional styles. Because it originated in Kunshan, it was called Kunqu Opera. After Kunqu Opera, Southern Opera seemed to have a new look, and its influence gradually increased.</p>
<p>After Wei Liangfu founded Kunqu Opera, many people studied under him for a time, but the one who truly inherited his mantle was Liang Chenyu, famous for his Chuanqi "Washing Silk." Fangyu Poetry Talk says: "What the world calls Kunshan Melody started with Liangfu, but Bolong alone obtained its true transmission." Liang, whose courtesy name was Bolong, was also from Kunshan and was a student at the Imperial Academy at the time. He was elegant and self-admiring, and was revered by lyricists. So much so that "every time there was a citrus exchange gathering, a dragon boat race, or a display of stringed instruments, singers, and dancers, if Bolong was not present, they would consider it inauspicious." He wrote the scattered songs "Jiangdong" and "Baimian," the Zaju dramas "Hongxiannü" and "Hongxiao," and the Chuanqi "Washing Silk." He was the first author of a Kunqu opera script.</p>
<p>Kunqiang (Kunshan melody) spread quickly soon after its creation and became popular everywhere. Northern Opera was already declining, and by the Daoguang era, it had completely disappeared. At that time, Wu Zhong also highly respected Kunlu (Kunshan style). Shen Defu's "Random Words on Appreciating Opera" says: "Since the people of Wu valued Southern Opera, they all followed Wei Liangfu of Kunshan, and Northern lyrics were almost abandoned." Other books also record this. Some believe that Kunqiang is rigorous and profound, and compared to the immature opera of the Middle Ages, it seems much more advanced. Is this probably the reason why Kunqu Opera has been able to last for four or five hundred years?</p>
<h3>Cheng Yanqiu Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Ma Lianliang and Xun Huisheng Will Also Come South in Batches</h3>
<p>— Chen Lin</p>
<p>The old male role actor, Xi Xiaobo, came to Shanghai this time to perform at the Golden Theater, and his performance was quite good. Due to contractual reasons, he will stop performing around the 20th of this month. After his performance, the Golden Theater authorities have already scheduled three batches of performers.</p>
<p>The first batch of performers is the Qiusheng Society led by Cheng Yanqiu. Since Yanqiu returned north with great acclaim in the winter of the 27th year, he has not come south. This time, he has accepted the invitation of the Golden Theater to make a comeback. Upon hearing the news, the general Cheng fans are all overjoyed. Yanqiu has now led the entire troupe to Jinan to perform, and after the performance, they will go to Qingdao, and then depart from Qingdao to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive around the end of this month. The old male actor that Yanqiu brought to Jinan for the performance is Chen Shaolin, but when performing at the Golden Theater in the future, he will still collaborate with his old partner Wang Shaolou. The other supporting roles are generally the same as the last time they came to Shanghai. The young male roles are Jiang Miaoxiang and Gu Yusun, the clowns are Cao Ergeng, Li Siguang, and Ci Shaoquan, the old male roles are Zhang Chunyan, the old female roles are Sun Futing, and the green female roles are Wu Fuqin. The only slight difference is that the painted face role of the Qiusheng Society, since Hou Xirui left, has been replaced by Liu Lianrong. Lianrong will come south with the Qiusheng Society this time. Yanqiu's masterpieces such as "The Story of Hongfu," "The Engagement of Gong Yan," and "Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" will surely be even more vivid. It is hoped that Mr. Cheng's newly written "The Swallow Letter" will also be seen by the people of Shanghai this time.</p>
<p>The second batch of performers is Ma Lianliang, who is most popular with the people of Shanghai. Lianliang has been arranging new plays and reforming costumes in Beijing, with great momentum. This time, he has decided to accept the invitation of the Golden Theater, and he will make many new contributions at that time. The newly compiled "Lintong Mountain" and the complete "Zhuangzi" will be performed in Shanghai in sequence. In "Lintong Mountain," Lianliang plays Qin Shubao, wearing an improved square-flag armor, which caused a sensation in the nine cities when it was performed in Beijing. The complete "Zhuangzi" starts from Zhuangzi's enlightenment and ends with the great splitting of the coffin. On the Golden Theater's side, Furong Cao will be paired with him to play Tian Shi. In addition to these two plays, Lianliang also has the "Five-Colored Sedan Chair," a secret book of the Fuliancheng Opera Troupe. He plans to perform several major plays in Shanghai continuously. The supporting roles that Lianliang has scheduled to come with him, in addition to his old partners Zhang Junqiu, Ye Shenglan, Ma Fulu, and Liu Lianrong, will also include Xiao Changhua and Yuan Shihai for the clown and painted face roles. The martial male role will be changed from Ma Junwu to Wu Yanheng. Lianliang has also ordered thousands of yuan worth of new costumes for performing new plays in Shanghai. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation.</p>
<p>The third batch of performers is Xun Huisheng. Huisheng has not come south to perform for eight years. Now, with the efforts of Mr. So-and-so and other friends of Huisheng in Shanghai, he has agreed to the theater's invitation to come south as soon as possible, but the date will be determined by Huisheng himself.</p>
<h3>Ma Lianliang's "Ten Volumes"</h3>
<h3>Old Shu's Jesting Remarks: Examination Basket</h3>
<p>— She Yu</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a debate about what kind of basket Wang Youdao should carry to the examination in the play "The Imperial Stele Pavilion." After the problem of boots and shoes in Xiao En's "Fishing and Killing Family," this is a material that dares to be discussed recently. The objects used in the play should be examined if necessary, as there is not much interest if they are all considered ordinary and passed over. The point of contention in today's examination basket problem is: one is to absolutely not use a net basket, and it is not allowed to use a net basket; it is believed that Wang Youdao should bring an examination basket with a larger capacity when entering the examination hall, which is more suitable for reason and sentiment. Moreover, most of the performers who follow the old rules use net baskets, even if there is no need to follow the ancient methods, those who must improve also believe that net baskets are more practical. It seems that net baskets are becoming more advantageous in the money array, and once the examination basket is broken, it cannot be returned to Wang Youdao's hands. Such liveliness is truly not inferior to the previous beauty of boots and shoes. I believe that those who use net baskets to bring to the examination hall can call this net-containing basket an examination net basket. I once remembered that a store selling baskets seemed to have the term examination net basket. If the examination basket is used for storing dishes, it may as well be called a food examination basket. In fact, it is already visible for use. The examination basket enters the kitchen as a container for food, so it is no longer necessary to think that bringing a net basket to the examination hall is an absolutely strange thing. I am using the examination net basket made in the play as an explanation for those who are arguing.</p>
<h3>Gu Eryi and His Wife Passed Away One After Another</h3>
<p>— Zhi Ge</p>
<p>The film actor Gu Eryi was a basic actor of the Xinhua Company before the war. His acting skills were quite strong. After the August 13th Incident, he moved to the rear and worked hard in film and drama, declaring labor for the country, and his ambition is commendable. Recently, according to the bad news, it is said that he died of meningitis in January, and all who heard it expressed their condolences! Gu's wife, Ms. Du Xiaojuan, also died last winter due to illness from childbirth. This is the so-called "misfortune never comes singly," which is truly a double loss for the drama world!</p>
