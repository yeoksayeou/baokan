<h3 id="c14">侵略威脅下之拉丁美洲 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>美總統羅斯福氏，本月十五日於泛美聯合會中發表演說，對於美洲國家互助互利以保和平之偉大成就盛加揄揚，更以東半球所發生之不幸事變警告美洲居民，促其於力加警戒中共求自衛，以保障和牛理想之持久。其語重心長，高瞻遠矚，足徵羅氏悲天憫人之抱負；際此戰爭野火繼續蔓延，侵略暴行漫無止境之際，聞之殆令人起空谷足音之感。雖然、美洲之安全問題，今日固木易言也。</p>
<p>自交通技術進步，世界各部間距離日見縮短，舉凡大地之任何角落，咸應視同整個世界之一部，往日新舊世界之分，迄今已全失其原有含義。所謂拉丁美洲者，雖立國日淺，於世界政治上之重大問題鮮有關聯，其利益亦僅局域於亞美利加一洲之內，實則亦復不能無感於世界政潮之波動。一九一四至一九一九之大戰，拉美各國雖保持中立於前，卒不能不相率參戰於後。此一事也。最近歐戰擴大，丹麥淪肯，荷蘭瀕危，丹荷屬領之在西半球者，乃形成美洲諸邦之重荷，日以如何應付　來事變為慮。此又一事也。然此固不獨泛美各國為然，即愛斯基摩之士人，喜瑪拉雅山麓之藩部，於此亦不能不為歐陸風雲所震撼。顧拉丁美洲之危機，其主要癥結，一則在於侵略國家墊力之不斷侵襲，一則在於各當事國人謀之未盡妥善。以是雖有美國身居全美盟主，擁有無匹實力，其泛美運動之能吾措置裕如，以防禦侵略暗影之襲來，於今似尙未具備充分把握。</p>
<p>百餘年前，美國揭藥門羅主義以抵制其他國家之干與美洲政治，雖獲實效，然實未能完全杜絕外來政治熱力之侵擾。若干年來，德義日本人民之移殖新大陸者絡繹不絕，第一次歐戰期間，德國且一度企圖假墨西哥為襲攻美國之捷徑。大戰而後，此三國在美洲之勢力膨脹益速，其經濟勢力縱不足與英美爭衡，在政治上則肆行糾織宣傳，且寖假而謀藉其極權理論以操縱各邦內政，三數年來拉丁美洲政變頻仍，殆鮮不與此項陰謀有關。雖墨西哥古巴智利諸國政台較開明進步。儼為中南美民主勢力之有力壁壘，美國亦力以杜絕侵略保障安全為己任，咸未足以遏阻此種反動力　之泛溢。日本雖着手較遲，其根基未足頡頏德國，亦復孜孜經營，不遺餘力。薩爾瓦多之左袒方，承認為滿，往事小遠，已顯示日方活動成果之一斑。近年其在巴西秘魯哥倫比亞黑西哥巴拿馬等邦所獲有之讓與地，且大部具有軍略價值足以威脅牌河地帶以及全美洲之安全。自美國廢止美日商約後，日方更竭力經營中南美外交關係，冀收桑榆之效。比月拉美各國之訪日考察團絡繹於途，紛與日本進行商務貿易之談判。日方並將以加藤外松仕特使，繼河井之後報聘中南美各國，主　五月間在巴西京城召開之南美使節會議。此等積極運用，其成效究將如何雖未可逆睹，但可決其必將益使日本勢力深殖於拉丁美洲，與德義之搆煽相呼應，且使美國對日之經濟武器遭受局部挫逆。</p>
<p>就中南美各國本身言，縱有泛美同盟之組織，彼此間之步驟姿態，初未能相互提携劃一·共為全美安寗福利而奮鬥。以言政治思想：或則對法西斯及侵略者之策劃活動，不惜予以優容及助長，或則竭力擁護民主運動，視極權主義若寇讐。以言經濟關係，則各國之利害各殊，目有若干矛盾存乎其間，往往適予人以縱橫椑闔之機。有如最近泛美會議倡組泛美銀行俾貸款各國增進對美國之貿易，各國於此態度不一，或則遲疑不決，或且公示反對：而另一方面，各國對於日本增進貿易之企圖，則如響斯應，趨之若鶩，甘任其尾閭而不辭，其不智孰甚。然而近利忘義，陰齊寇糧，即賢明如墨西哥當局者且所不免，遑論其他。此則視泛美安全為己任之美國當局及全美洲有識之士所應深切注意者。</p>
<p>今茲戰爭威脅已漸及美洲，於羅斯福總統大聲疾呼之餘，拉丁美洲全體人民及其當局，咸應亟謀所以自處之道。如其甘為侵略者之輿臺。以放縱其政治攻勢經濟攻勢為得計，則無異自貽伊戚，未來隱憂將無所底止。如其不然，則當就美總統『美洲各國必須就吾人是否受有滅脅一層互相諮詢，並共同努力自衛」一語，深加玩味體會，付之實施，以杜絕來日之亂源，於圓際正義及公道作有力之維護，勿令彼侵略者竊笑其貪慾之獨能獲逞於拉丁美洲也。</p>

<p>會場部署餓條不紊</p>
<p>當局以本屆年會為各方所密切注目、參加者定必擁擠、故對維持會塲秩序、部署頗為週密、跑馬廳朝北大門、高懸車輛進入之標識、近馬霍路大門、則為納稅人出入之處、並在該處橫貫靜安寺路上空、高懸納稅人年會之白色布條、以促起納稅人之注意、跑馬廳入口、各有華印捕四名守衛、內部會塲四周、復有中·英·日·印警捕五十餘名、佈成警戒錢、設崗站立、戒備極為嚴密、會塲入口處、派駐專人，查收參加納稅人之證明文件並在旁搭置問訊處、以備納稅人之諮詢、舉行會議塲所、即為跑馬應之觀臺、但在觀臺前面另建茅棚、作為主席臺、主席臺兩旁、則分別以短籬攔成「贊成」「不贊成」兩處、因舉手表決計算困難、故設此以備表決時納稅人自動走入何方之用、</p>

<p>加損提案竟告通過</p>
<p>議程中八案、（一）（二）（三）（四）（五）（六）（八）等各案、均順利通過、惟討論第七案時、情形　趨緊張、日籍納稅人林雄吉臨時提出緊急　議、即為預算案可被一致贊助而予以通過、但工部局經濟委員會欲加强其組織、而擴充其委員人數為—二名、包　央人兩名、日人兩名、美人兩名、華人兩名、德人一名、義人一名、法人一名、荷人一名、該委員職權、即在研究工部局行政所應予以修正之各點、而工部局應表示願絕對接受該委員會之建議、大會遂將一九四　年度新預算案通過、由樊克令氏宜布於下年度起加捐白分之五十、並議決擴充工部局經濟委員會之人數為十二人、</p>
<p>樂隊仍將繼續維持</p>
<p>至　於工部局昔樂隊問題、齊素爾氏建議、工部局預算案雖可贊成、但須取消昔樂隊經費、而由工部局　予三萬元之津貼、此案在通過預算案時、竟未提出討論、最後齊索氏起立發言、申述其理由至詳、但其演辭之後部、被大衆之呼聲所掩沒、提出反對者、為哈力斯及阿諾兩氏、渠等稱、工部局昔樂隊所耗去者、僅為全部預算百分之一中之一半、而敎育事業耗去者、竟佔百分之十、但同樣有大量居民未從音樂隊及教育設施獲得直接利益、故認為教育事業亦應取消、如不予取消、則音樂隊亦無被取消之理由、</p>
<p>當局表示嚴禁賭博</p>
<p>昨日年會席上、有俄籍律師沙立金氏建議、工部局對租界內「吃角子老虎」、可徵收捐稅、渠稱、如每月有一千架「吃角子老虎被微稅、每架一百元、則每年可得一·二〇〇·〇〇〇元、亦可補助工部局財政之不足、對此點、樊克令氏答稱、公共租界當局根本上反對賭博、凡賭傳性質之事業、絕不能尤許在租界內存在、渠又稱、睹博同題、目前仍屬嚴重、</p>

<p>— 荃</p>
<p>太陽蹲在雲朶裏，發不出叭力似的，靜悄悄底，整個大地，蒙上灰色，雖然靜安寺路馬　路是那麼熱鬧。</p>
<p>跑馬總會門首，橫掛着一方　外僑納稅年會的白布，記者穿過了警務處巡警的警戒綫，走上了大會的會塲，找到了記者席的坐位，平着心，靜着氣，讀那擬定了的議　。跑馬廳的龍飛鬥正門，和新世界的大門首，也都掛着「外僑納稅年會一底白布，臨風招展，長蛇似的汽車，首尾啣接着駛入跑馬廳去。塲內的佈置，有一座臨時架起木台，面對着看台，台前放滿了各植鮮花，三架發音機，廣播着各董舉的演說辭。看台上的坐位，都舖滿　長板，這就是外僑納稅人底坐位，四面呼呼的風，雖然已是春大，但吹在面上，仍是怪冷，幾位碧眼納稅人，都把外衣上領護着　子。</p>
<p>二時半正，樊克令總董首先開讀議案，主席，秘書，選定以後，最重要的是議案第七條了。無　，各界一致寄以重視的，就是第七條——本年度工部局的加稅案。日僑納稅人林雄吉在日本新聞記者的包圍下，走上了演說臺，一位任翻譯要員的林哲夫氏，他帶上了一根拐杖，一跛一跛的在林雄吉後面，也走了臺上去，當時全塲空氣為之要張。日籍記者是忙着拍照，在塲的日僑，更是鼓掌示意。林氏是操着日語，記者　見日僑納稅人一陣陣的鼓掌，後來經林哲夫代為翻做英文，才知道林氏是主張對第七條加以修正，擴充現在工部局財務委員會組織機構，擴增中，美，英，日委員各二名，法，德，意，荷各一名，作為　條件約予以通過第七案。後來麥納唐的演說，和遠東通訊社齊素爾的反對工部局現有之昔樂隊，用資撙節，但，道是得不到在塲西人的同情，用吁」的方式，以示對抗。麥齊兩氏，都討沒趣似的，終於給納稅人否決了。好像外僑納稅人對增加百分之五十是滿不在乎的，通過了議案第七條，全一場空氣鬆馳了許多。</p>
<p>老天有意為難，絲絲的毛雨，下着不停，風伯推波助瀾，向露天納稅人施威，於是，不終席而退出會塲的外僑，佔了三分一。</p>
<p>昨天的日橋，都坐在北面看臺的第二級，在記者席的前一排。他們對於議案一至六條，好像不感到痛癢，默默不發表什麼。九位工部局董事，都是穿着大體服，總董樊克令的演說，發音洪亮，莫肅爵士則較之為低。凱自威是鎭靜，頻頻起立附議樊克令的提案，在塲的外僑和新聞記者，除了記者以外，都是西服，去年還有嚴，朱兩先生的中衣作陪，今年惟我獨尊了！一笑。</p>
<p>時鐘指上了五時，才踏上了歸途，可是「雨」「風」依然施虐，一幕緊張而引人軍視的外僑納稅年會，也在風雨裏閉幕。</p>

<p>近　來米價漲落變化之巨恒出意料、溯前關漲風、一號西貢最高峯曾達四十七元半、後復倐忽下降至四十元左右、此次以金價暴漲、突又回昂在一週之間、逐日前進、恢復了前决高峯、計升騰七八元之巨、誠為米市中所未有之變化、昨則變化尤多、初落後升、再伏冉起、晨開賣買雙方、貧一度回軟、且以價格提高、產地劃價接近、心思稍遜、作客無　店胃客銷、悉鮮問津、不過浮囤散戶、素抱心思作用、隨機應變、已在喊低、相互授受、拋出補進、亦殊栗落、若一號西貢祇開四十七元、小絞四十二元六角、較之前盤業降半元至近元、經此客銷又出手、一動百動、反呈活潑，行情亦隨之而高、又復原盤、嗣賣買頗旺、獲利者粉紛回出、墊空者藉事補進、各是其是、中市大局市况反形成供求相平、遷延許久、市氣漸衰、銷塲複懈、轉見軟態、各貨價冉度下貶、待將收市小絞跌至四十三元時、忽一般心思家乘廉突進、行情猝提半元、一號西貢仍為四十七元半、小紋四十三元半、</p>
<p>厚薄粳米、塲外暗盤、大勢相同、亦乏榮辱聞常帮粳猶開四十六七元、中四十四五元、靑泗特薄四十六元、高市四十五元半、四十五元、南港早晚稻四十三四元、獨糯米以售盤較他貨相距已遠、最為低廉、頗有大戶囤收、故茲行情不以洋米影響、續能提升半元有奇、開灤陽特元四十元、常丹白元特自三十九元六七角、决至三十七元半統計粳糯到貨、由虹口大昌公司輸入界內、續有二三千包、</p>
<p>洋米初堅後跌、市形漸有回平之趨勢、當早市開盤時、市塲傳說某華商所裝一二號西貢二千七百噸、係裝挪丹兩輪來滬、半途在港被阻、因此空氣頓時緊張、人心向上、雖有大戶暗塞、而現洋米又被本客行囤抬高至五六七角、旋傳南昌克復、而獲利者亦趁高脫手、市即下趨價父平落三五角，午後賣氣更旺、價父續削半元、一號西貢早市喊至四十八元者、下午巳跌進四十七元、一號路貨早市五十五元七角、下午五十五元尙難暢脫、二號四五月份早市五十四元半、下午降至五十三元半、即交暹羅曾開五十三元二角、全日開現洋米五百二十五噸、現貨八九千包、</p>

<p>國布</p>
<p>昨布市以散額囤戶爭先脫手、實需有限、同業及新　戶殺價購進、故售盤慘跌、富貴細布　低盤會達四十二元、富貴細斜最低三十六元七角半、較昨市回小每疋五元左右、粗布回跌每疋二角半至一元、怡和貨較為堅穩、本街交易驟淡、批發號辦粗布斜紋一百餘件、同業賣買各貨二百餘件、色布業暫緩　購坯布、粵帮辦色布漂布府綢二百餘件、浙路溫甬帮辦斜紋色布粗布三百餘件、今（十八日）有疋頭七百八十五　、運往香港、</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日繼續活躍殊甚、不因紗價之回疲、而棉價稍鬆也、同業間對於現貨進胃始終健旺、因印度棉花、運滬船艘困難、各方又向巴西棉活躍、但悉為六七月份裝船者、其售價雖蛟印棉為貴、然與美棉相較尙廉多多、茲將昨日棉市以美匯五元九三七五折合送蔽價如下、</p>

<h3 id="c94">愛真理的精神 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 楊向芳</p>
<p>『吾愛吾師，吾尤愛眞理。』這是紀元前三百多年的希臘大哲人亞里士多德的名言，一直到現在提到這句話，沒有一個人不感到亞氏愛眞理的精神的偉大。亞氏哲學上的成就，得力於他的師友頗多，然而他覺得更應維護的就是宇宙的眞理。從這裏，可以知道他是怎樣的虛心研究，不持成見了</p>
<p>虛心的意思，就是客觀地觀察事實，袪除蒙蔽個人的感情的成見。任何事實，任何臆設，只委和研究的間題有關，不管他和個人的見解有無抵觸，只要證據充分，總是虛懷若谷的接受。能如此，則研究所得的結果，才能無所偏倚，正確可靠。</p>
<p>英哲赫胥黎（HuxleyＴ．Ｈ．）會說：『靈魂不朽之說，我並不否認，也不承認。我拿不出什麼埋由來信仰牠，但我也沒有法子否認牠……我相信別的東西時，總要有證據；牠若給我以同等的證據，我也可以相信靈魂不朽了。』究竟靈魂朽與不朽，是另一問題，但赫氏這種打破成見的態度是値得我們崇敬的。</p>
<p>人類的思想多來自經騐，而各人心中往往夾雜着偏嗜厭惡，希望等等情緒，因此與外界事物接觸時，其認識辨別常有錯誤，但因被個人的感情所掩蔽和牽制或山理智的卑斷，固執我見，而不自知；又因教育，習慣，職業及其他生琿與心理上的差異，便養成種僻性，不肯虛心研究。</p>
<p>隨着科學的進步和新研究不斷的發現，所謂眞理者也許有變遷和修正的可能，但在一切事物的關係上，總有具備客觀的價値為一般人所共認的事實。我們對於這些相對的接近事實的眞理，應該以熱誠的態度來維護牠，追尋牠。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以肯定地說，眞理是我們思想活動的，導，和日常生活的準則。一僩充滿着生命的活力的人，必須時時刻刻懷着追求眞理的熱望。</p>
<p>我們如果要希望培養正確的思想和合理的生活準則，必須破除成見，力避盲從。對於任何事物，要以嚴正的客觀態度去仔細考量和判斷。抱定「反求諸己」的精神，尊重眼前的事實，虛心下懷，袪除偏嗜，體騐中世紀那位哲人的名言</p>
<p>體育</p>
<h3 id="c95">成人的體育 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 飽石溪</p>
<p>成人的體育，應晋遍的提倡。</p>
<p>「體育」在中國，似乎是特殊階級—小數學生和運動選手—的娛樂品。大多數人，尤其是職業成年人，是沒有機會和牠發生關係的。因此，國人大多數還是「東亞病夫」。</p>
<p>孤島上還沒有公共體育塲所，給民衆鍛錬身體。這不僅影響個人的健康，間接影饗整個民族體格的前途。</p>
<p>在體育曙光還未　照全民的前夕，我們不必奢望國內有大規模的集團運動塲，像蘇聯和其他歐美先進國家一樣，給全民鍛鍊身體，可是，我們今日最低限度應採取最簡便的運動方法，鍛鍊體魄。推己及人，普遍的提倡。</p>
<p>職業界的成年人，旣沒有機會到學校或體育團體的運動塲和健身室，鍛鍊身體，我以為可以採取下面幾種簡易的運動方法：</p>
<p>（一）深呼吸—每日淸晨在陽光之下，空氣新鮮的塲所，舉行深呼吸運動，可以使肺部發達，防禦肺癆的發生。同時促進身心的健全。</p>
<p>（二）八段錦—是一種柔飲體操。每日晨起或睡前練習這種運動，使全身筋骨活動，血脈流通。體魄定必日漸强健。</p>
<p>（三）步行—體弱的成年人，旣不便舉行各種運動，儘可利用步行，鍛鍊身體。苟能多作遠距離的步行，不但可以强身，並可節省車資。</p>
<p>此外，如跳繩，漫跑，溜冰，游覽公園和遠足探視名勝都是簡易的鍊身法。苟能持之以恒，日無間斷的鍛鍊，必可保持我人體魄的健康，增進身心的愉快。</p>
<p>普週的提倡成人體育，使大家都有健全的體格，不僅是個人和家庭的幸福，也就是全民族前途的幸福。</p>

<h3 id="c96">猴助手 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 徐孟標</p>
<p>在新加坡的植物園裏，養着兩隻猴子，一隻名叫金寶，另一隻名叫貝得。這兩隻小動物，在科學上倒有很可觀的貢獻。該園主任康納會稱讚牠們說：「這兩隻猴子是我敢聰明的助手。」</p>
<p>在高聳的熱帶喬木上，往往開着植物學上極有價値的花卉。如果叫人爬上去採集，那麼非但很困難，幷且危險非常；這兩隻猴子受過專門的訓練，能够在幾分鐘內，爬到樹頂，把這種植物學的標本採下來。</p>
<p>不過，猴子有種壞脾氣：在牠們飢餓時，常常會將採釗的花吃掉。但是祇要預先給牠們吃些香蕉之類的食物，便不致再有同樣的事情發生了。</p>
<h3 id="c97">耶穌的感謝概念　（二） <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>耶穌為他將受的苦謝感謝上帝，遭與世人因物質上的成功而感謝。究全不同。記得有一次，有十個麻癘病人，來求耶穌論治。耶穌治好他們的病之後，十人之中，只有一人想到此縣不可忘，回來感謝耶穌。我們把許多的特權和利益，認為應當，絕無敬　之心，這是我們做人的大錯。真正的感謝心，是一種精神力量，用苦功做來的。這種精神力量，能給人以道德的勇敢，使人心理向上。感謝的心，也可以說是精　思想，日無思想的人，大都是無感謝心的。我們不能平空而對上帝起感謝之心，必須在人生戰塲上苦鬥，得着勝利之後，纔會起感謝心。我們要體會到眞正的感謝精神，惟一方法，就是興　逆奮鬥，應付自己種種特殊問題，使自己有感謝的理由。有兩個靑年，想謀職位，自已不敢脫，乃晴他們的母親，代求耶穌。耶穌見他們對自己所求所要的一無概念，乃坦白問他們，說，「我喝的杯：你們能喝嗎？我受的洗，你們能受囑？」換一句話就是說，我在人生戰塲五所忍受一切艱難困苦，你們能忍受嗎？你們受了痛苦失望之後，還能為之感謝上帝嗎？當一切都似乎反對你的時候，你有什麼做人的把握嗎？以上所問的話，耶穌今天也要提出來問我們，我們能為　逆感謝，為從　逆所得的敎訓感謝嗎？（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c98">抄襲救難 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>目出談編韓先生：</p>
<p>其實我們也不能怪你對於撰稿的疏忽，正因為一個人的精力有限，不能把世上所有的醫本完全讀過：而且世界上也沒有一個人能把所閱讀過的文章完全記憶在腦裏。</p>
<p>你不是早已對投稿諸君說過，不要把別人的文章竊來冒充自己的作品嗎？可是在本月六日的「自由談」裏，我發現了一位抄襲家——邵雄飛——他把「靑年修養雜談」（桐鄉陸費逵著中華出版）裏的一篇「職業的主權」搬到「自中談一裏來欺驅讀者，當他自已的作品。</p>
<p>雖然，他的篇後的「移酬救難」是一種善舉，不過這種舉動正像偷兒偷了人家的東西作為自己送人的禮物一樣的滑稽可笑。假使在這禮物授受的當兒，被人指出這不是禮物而是贓物，那時送禮者的臉將不知紅到什樣地步，而受禮者也一定要感到不舒服吧。像這種損人不利己的舉動，即使是善意的，也沒有什麼光榮。</p>
<p>我想難胞們也是深明禮義的，像邵雄飛先生的這種「義舉」是決不肯接受的。相反地，正應該給他一番敎訓，好使他以後不再來侮辱你們。</p>
<p>練習寫文章原是一件好事，「救難」在這大時代的變動中，除了雞胞本身以外，也是人人應盡的義務，不過竊了他人的文章再來「移酬救難」，於人格上是一件得不償失的事，我深為邵君可惜，希望他以後還要自重一點。</p>

<h3 id="c99">人格大拍賣 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 李永運</p>
<p>敬獻於抄家之前</p>
<p>睜開了眼請看一看上海這社會，第一個勾起的印像就是投機取巧；風氣一開搖搖筆桿的人也打算覓捷徑而登龍了。但抄書而能成家，不過是一個傳聞，至於事實上呢——姑也學個時髦抄上一句：「未之有也。」</p>
<p>投的是「機」，取的是「巧」，抄家本意自然是混水裏摸魚。可是這正是所謂聰明反被聰明誤；光天化日，衆目昭彰之下，竟想不被揭發，那也眞是「難也天。」</p>
<p>隱名埋姓，人不知鬼不曉，縱然事敗好像也「嘸啥難為情」；不過，在這百物漲價的年頭何苦來一手人格大拍賣。抄家豈「三思之」？記住，我佛有言：回頭是岸。那麼，我你他——依讀者，「作者」，編者之次序，非老氣橫秋也——全幸甚。</p>
<p>時代進步，奇事世出。到了「為烈」的「於今」，竟有抄稿救難；想來是深　「盜亦有道」之旨，不過我倒不打算說「情有可原」，却投出一個問號：「是何居心？」大的只好說「叵測」「叵測」了。我也只得「帶住。」</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>關於這痛心的不幸事件，經過朱雲亭先生的揭發和李永運先生的『獻辭』以後，『抄襲的慈善家』邵雄飛先生堪與垃圾為伍的人格，已經赤裸裸地暴露在幾十萬讀者的眼前，不必編者再來說甚麼話了。</p>
<p>我祇思在這裏聲明一句，該『慈善家』所抄襲的文章稿酬應予取消，為的是要表示我們對於道種事件的深惡痛絕，表示我們的不與『抄襲慈善家』合作，使他知道『慈善家』未曾做成，而人格却已先掃地是一件得不償失的事情。</p>

<p>— 實章</p>
<p>讀了三月二十八日劉導鴻先生的『偉大的友情』後，心中似乎感覺到有一種莫可名狀的輕鬆，愉快：因為在以前，我根本未曾想到過世界上也有着同情我，與我有着同一感觸的人。我總以為我的需要友情，需要慰藉，需要鼓勵，需要帮助，是我的歇斯蒂里，是我個人的奢望，並不是普遍的人類渴望。因此，道就成為我十八年來蘊藏着的一件大秘密。</p>
<p>一個人來到世界上，在他的命運上，遭遇上，就無形的叢生了許多困難，悲痛，絕望。所以每一個人也就需要種種精神上的安慰與滋潤。當一旦他不能得到的時候，就漸漸的對世界冷酷起來，淡漠起來，甚而厭憤起來。人原是畸形的，人心原是矛盾的。當你希望得人的友情時，為什麼就不肯先賜自己的友情給別人呢？為什麼小肯稍賜安慰與人而獲得別人更大的安慰呢？人旣需要「偉大的友情」，但為什麼人間就缺少了它？這永遠是我的疑問。</p>
<p>要知道，當有人賜你友情或同時亦希望接納你的友情時，這是你的幸福，是你的權利，你應富保持它，接受他。因為一個摧殘自己幸福以及拒絕應享權利的人是愚蠢的—假如你確信那是眞的幸福，眞的權利。同時，也就產生了應盡的義務，就是去增添他人的幸福與權利。</p>
<p>每個人都希望有一個美滿崇高的人生，但是能不能得到它，那是要看每個人所付的處世代價了。</p>

<p>推　給有血性的男女</p>
<p>吳永剛君最近完成「岳飛盡忠報國」一片，筆者巳看過試片，茲略述其觀感於次：</p>
<p>以前，我沒有注意過這個劇本，只知道新華在開拍岳飛，私以為所採取故事為十二道金脾及風波事等幾節，現在所擷取的，却是從岳飛入學到搶挑小梁王為止。編導者所要觀衆知道的，並非是岳將軍身經百戰的豐功偉蹟，而是極力强調於岳飛成人的經過，他怎樣的孜孜苦讀，怎樣的勤習武藝，特別是怎樣鍛　其鐵一般的意志，這是最重要的一節，便決定了他日後捨身衛國之心。</p>
<p>這一個故事，不能有羅曼史，須在緊張而嚴肅的調子中發展下去。編導者也盡力希望做到這一點。他處處避掉平庸的過塲戲，而接一連二的使大大小小的高潮出現。這里所謂高潮，不一定是指熱鬧刺戟的書面，也包括到深有含蓄的對白。務使岳母的敎子有方，周侗的循循善誘，以及岳飛的堅毅有為，都深深地打入觀衆的心坎中去。</p>
<p>筆者願此作推進薦於血性男女之前，當你們看了太多的戀情作品之後，而看一看「岳飛盡忠報國」，當會肅然起敬，頭腦像潑上一勺冷水似的清醒過來的。</p>

<p>神秘女郎葛電泰嘉寶，在銀幕上出現的一副面龐，老是冰冰冷的嘴臉，彷彿經過不少的世故，把面部筋肉刺激得鬆她了，不願把一絲笑臉，留給世人看。過去二年中，這位有名女藝人，和影迷暌遠了好久，她需要休養，也需要靜默，想在銀壇上，以更新的姿態，與世人相見。</p>
<p>這决，嘉寶如願了。在「妮娜琦珈」中她不但唱歌與跳舞，特別是展開了一副笑臉，把全世界的觀衆，全跟着她笑，笑一個暢快。無疑地，這在嘉寶工作史中，是嶄新的一頁。最有名的導演怪傑劉別謙，是全片負責人，他把全劇處理得不脫不黏，恰到好處，尤其是一種「劉別謙筆觸」，只有這位劉別謙才有這種幽默作風。</p>
<p>我們看了不少嘉寶的悲劇，她深入淺出的演技，激起了多少人內心的共鳴。像「妮娜琦珈一的演出，的確嘉竇的作風是轉變了。她不但悲劇演出，有甚高的成就；就是喜劇的演出，也有非常的成功，足證她的演技是多方面的，非有偉大的才力，決不能勝任愉快。</p>

Our delegation left Singapore on March 6, passed through Yangon on March 12, left Kunming on April 7, and departed from Guiyang on April 14. Today is the last group of 43 people, a portion of the delegation had already arrived in Chongqing separately. This delegation was initiated and organized by the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association. All Nanyang properties have sent personnel to participate, representing 11 million overseas Chinese, to return to the country to comfort the front and rear military and civilians, pay tribute to the leader, and inspect wartime facilities. They witnessed compatriots working hard to engage in the war of resistance and national construction in Kunming, Guiyang, and other places. Everything in politics, economy, education, culture, transportation, and industry has seen rapid progress. The speed of progress is beyond our imagination. I am sincerely gratified and cannot express it in words. Our belief in the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction is even deeper. When the ferry arrived at the Chuqimen pier, the military band played loudly, the welcoming representatives cheered slogans, and the members of the delegation took off their hats and nodded to show their gratitude. Wu Tiecheng, Chen Shuren, Xiao Jishan, Hong Lanyou, and other general representatives of various organizations and groups, stepped forward first to welcome the delegation on behalf of all walks of life. All the members of the delegation got off the ferry and shook hands with each member of the delegation.

Head Pan Guoqu then gave a brief speech of thanks to all walks of life amid cheers. He was then divided into reception cars and went to Jialing New Village for rest. In the evening, Head Pan broadcasted to overseas Chinese from the International Broadcasting Station, reporting on his impressions along the way and the situation upon arriving in Chongqing.

<p>Chongqing: Chairman Chiang believes that frugality and thrift are the great principles of governing the country. During the war of resistance, it is especially important to be diligent and self-disciplined.

<p>Chongqing: A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Shao Lizi, the newly appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union, on the morning of the 17th, and asked about his impressions after being appointed and the date of his departure. He said that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union is extremely close, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries are also quite sincere. He personally feels that the responsibility of being appointed to the Soviet Union is heavy, and he feels both fearful and excited. In the future, he will abide by the government's diplomatic policy and the hopes of the people, and strive to do his best. He recalled that fourteen years ago, he traveled to the Soviet Union and deeply admired the arduousness and greatness of the national construction work. In recent years, he has followed the party and the country's advanced figures and people from all walks of life and devoted himself to the work of Sino-Soviet cultural connection. Therefore, on a personal level, he is especially happy to revisit the progressive Soviet Union after fourteen years. As for the date of departure to the Soviet Union, it was originally scheduled to be within a few days, but due to official and personal affairs, it is necessary to take care of them, and the dental disease has not yet healed (it is expected that it will be possible to set off in the middle of next month).

<p>Hong Kong: A foreign dispatch from Tokyo stated that the anti-war anger in Japan is becoming increasingly high. Anti-war riots in the Tokyo area are increasing day by day. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department dispatched a large number of police day and night, but they are still unable to prevent them. On the 8th, simultaneous large-scale searches were carried out in the 86th and 8th districts under its jurisdiction. From 7:00 p.m. on the 8th to the morning of the 9th, 18 anti-war military officers and more than 2,900 young people were found, including 47 women. After this incident occurred, the anti-war voices in various places accelerated their spread, and anti-war groups sprang up like mushrooms. The Japanese government is extremely anxious and is working hard to devise countermeasures. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Latin America Under the Threat of Aggression <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>On the 15th of this month, U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Pan American Union, in which he praised the great achievements of mutual assistance and mutual benefit among American countries in maintaining peace. He further warned the residents of the Americas with the unfortunate events that have occurred in the Eastern Hemisphere, urging them to be vigilant and seek self-defense together, so as to ensure the lasting peace of the ideal of the cow. His words are earnest and far-sighted, which is enough to show Mr. Luo's ambition to be compassionate to the world. At a time when the wildfire of war continues to spread and the atrocities of aggression are endless, hearing it is almost like hearing the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. However, the safety problem of the Americas is not easy to talk about today.</p>
<p>Since the advancement of transportation technology, the distance between various parts of the world has been shortened day by day. Any corner of the earth should be regarded as a part of the whole world. The distinction between the old and new worlds has completely lost its original meaning. Although Latin America has a short history of national establishment and has little connection with major issues in world politics, and its interests are only limited to the Americas, it cannot but be affected by the fluctuations of the world political tide. During the Great War from 1914 to 1919, although Latin American countries remained neutral in the beginning, they eventually had to join the war one after another. This is one thing. Recently, the European war has expanded, Denmark has fallen, and the Netherlands is in danger. The Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere have formed a heavy burden on the American countries, and they are concerned about how to deal with the coming events. This is another matter. However, this is not only true for the Pan American countries, but also for the Eskimos and the vassal states at the foot of the Himalayas, who cannot but be shocked by the European situation. However, the main crux of the crisis in Latin America lies in the continuous invasion of the power of the aggressive countries and the incomplete and proper human affairs of the countries concerned. Therefore, even though the United States is the leader of the Americas and has unparalleled strength, its Pan American movement seems to lack sufficient confidence to deal with the dark shadows of aggression.</p>
<p>More than a hundred years ago, the United States unveiled the Monroe Doctrine to resist other countries' interference in American politics. Although it was effective, it failed to completely prevent the intrusion of external political heat. Over the years, German, Italian, and Japanese people have continued to immigrate to the New World. During the First European War, Germany once attempted to use Mexico as a shortcut to attack the United States. After the war, the power of these three countries in the Americas expanded more quickly. Although their economic power is not enough to compete with the United Kingdom and the United States, they have been carrying out propaganda and conspiracy in politics, and they are gradually trying to use their totalitarian theory to manipulate the internal affairs of various countries. In the past few years, political changes in Latin America have been frequent, and they have almost all been related to this conspiracy. Although countries such as Mexico, Cuba, and Chile have more open and progressive political platforms and are powerful bastions of democratic power in Central and South America, and the United States is also committed to preventing aggression and ensuring security, it is not enough to curb the overflow of this reactionary force. Although Japan started later and its foundation is not enough to compete with Germany, it is still diligently engaged and spares no effort. El Salvador's support of the side and recognition of Manchukuo, past events are small and far away, have shown a glimpse of the results of Japanese activities. In recent years, the concessions it has acquired in countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Heixico, and Panama mostly have military value and are enough to threaten the Plata River region and the security of the Americas. Since the United States abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Japan has been working hard to manage diplomatic relations with Central and South America, hoping to receive the effect of the Sangyu. This month, delegations from various Latin American countries have traveled to Japan one after another to conduct negotiations on business and trade with Japan. Japan will also send Kato Sotome as a special envoy to repay the visit to various Central and South American countries after Kawai, and will host a South American envoys conference in Brazil's capital in May. The effectiveness of this active operation is still unknown, but it can be determined that it will make Japan's power deeply rooted in Latin America, echoing Germany and Italy's instigation, and make the United States' economic weapons against Japan suffer partial setbacks.</p>
<p>In terms of the Central and South American countries themselves, even with the organization of the Pan American Alliance, their steps and postures have not been able to help each other and fight together for the security, well-being and welfare of the Americas. In terms of political ideology: some are willing to tolerate and promote the plans and activities of the Fascists and aggressors, while others are striving to support the democratic movement and regard totalitarianism as a foe. In terms of economic relations, the interests of each country are different, and there are certain contradictions between them, which often provide opportunities for people to horizontally and vertically separate. For example, the recent Pan American Conference advocated the establishment of a Pan American Bank to provide loans to various countries to increase trade with the United States. The attitudes of various countries towards this are inconsistent, some are hesitant, and some are even publicly opposed. On the other hand, various countries are eager to respond to Japan's attempts to increase trade, and they are willing to be its tail without resigning. How unwise is it? However, even enlightened authorities such as Mexico cannot avoid forgetting righteousness for the sake of immediate interests and secretly providing grain to the thieves, let alone others. This is what the US authorities, who regard Pan-American security as their responsibility, and all knowledgeable people in the Americas should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Now the threat of war has gradually reached the Americas. After President Roosevelt's loud appeal, all the people and authorities of Latin America should urgently seek ways to deal with it. If they are willing to be the platform for the aggressors and regard letting go of their political and economic offensives as a good idea, it is no different from harming themselves, and future hidden worries will be endless. If not, then they should carefully consider and implement President Roosevelt's words, "The countries of the Americas must consult each other on whether we are threatened with annihilation, and work together to defend ourselves," so as to eliminate the source of chaos in the future and make a powerful defense of international justice and fairness, so that the aggressors will not secretly laugh at their greed alone being able to succeed in Latin America.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Japan's Potential Occupation of the Dutch East Indies: Britain and France Will Not Allow It; US-British Cooperation in the Far East Possible; East Indies Government Continues to Maintain Special Alert <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Paris – A French Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that Britain and France will definitely not allow Japan to invade Sumatra, Java, Borneo, or New Guinea, territories of the Dutch East Indies located south of the Philippines. This has led France to believe that if Japan attempts to occupy the Dutch East Indies, the United States will certainly step in to confront them. The communiqué also stated that if Japan allows Britain and France to extend their blockade policy to the Sea of Japan to cut off the route of American goods to Vladivostok, France may be able to sign an agreement with Japan. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Budapest – The pro-Central Powers newspaper "Magyar Szemle" here yesterday quoted President Roosevelt's speech on the Dutch East Indies issue, attacking aggressor nations, stating that President Roosevelt's speech is sufficient to stir American sentiment. It also stated that under such circumstances, President Roosevelt made this speech because he believed that the right moment had matured to inform the nation of the US government's intentions regarding the international situation. The newspaper also believes that British and American cooperation in the Far East is possible in the future. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch, according to Batavia, Dutch East Indies, the East Indies government is silent on the possibility of the Netherlands being drawn into the European war and is unwilling to comment. However, the authorities have today continued to maintain alert measures, ordering police and special guard teams to be stationed around post offices, telegraph offices, trains, and wireless telecommunications agencies. Dutch expatriates in the East Indies believe that (1) the Netherlands is determined to adhere to its policy of neutrality, and neither the Dutch mainland nor the Dutch East Indies wishes to be drawn into the European war; (2) based on its neutral stance, the Netherlands will not actively seek protection from one or more third countries, so unless the Netherlands makes a suggestion, Britain and the United States will not take any measures to protect the Dutch East Indies; (3) once the Dutch mainland is drawn into the war, communication between the East Indies and the homeland will easily be cut off, but even so, politically, the East Indies will not undergo any changes. The government of the Dutch East Indies will naturally be strengthened and still ruled by the Netherlands. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – Responsible parties here firmly refute the notion that if the Netherlands is invaded, its overseas territories will be placed under the protection of foreigners. They assert that even if the Netherlands is trampled upon, the Dutch East Indies will still remain an unconquered part of the Netherlands. According to reports from here, in the event of a sudden change in European affairs that disrupts communication between the Netherlands and its Indian government, the Dutch Indian government will still be able to continue governing India without external assistance or protection. The Dutch East Indies possesses naval and land forces whose strength cannot be ignored by any country. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>The Hague – Observers here say that the fate of the Dutch East Indies archipelago, should the Netherlands be forced to join the current European war, has become the focus of attention. Government authorities and the general public, after careful study, all believe that the speech made yesterday by US President Roosevelt is of particular importance. In general, no matter how strong a certain country's ambitions in the Indian Ocean may be, the United States is the natural protector of the Dutch territories there. Therefore, any sign that proves the American public's increasing concern for the European situation is welcomed by the Dutch government and the public. President Roosevelt's speech yesterday is one such sign. The "General Summary" newspaper here also published an article praising it, stating briefly that President Roosevelt, in his historical speech delivered in Chicago in October 1937, had likened aggressor nations to plagues that must be quarantined. Since taking office, the president's consistent policy has been to oppose military aggression. From yesterday's speech, it can be seen that this policy has not changed. The "Maasbode" newspaper also stated that the United States' conservative neutrality is the same as Italy's non-participation in the war, but the latter is inclined toward Germany, while the former shares common ideas with Britain and France. As of today, the strength of isolationist forces within the United States cannot be underestimated, which is undeniable. However, it is also a fact that public opinion in that country increasingly feels that the United States will one day fight shoulder to shoulder with Britain and France. (Havas Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Japanese and Italian Diplomatic Maneuvering</p>
<p>London – Today, all newspapers here are paying close attention to Japan's sudden expression of concern regarding the future of the Dutch East Indies after the Netherlands was drawn into the war. The "News Chronicle" reported that Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, coinciding with the Italian newspapers' agitation of anti-British sentiment and the German-spread rumors of the Allied powers' plan to undermine Dutch neutrality, are simultaneously forming a large-scale diplomatic tactic aimed at intimidating the Allied powers and diverting their war efforts in Scandinavia, while also alarming the Mediterranean and the Pacific. However, Britain's primary task of defeating the Germans will not be hindered by this. The actions of Japan and Italy are not enough to keep the British up at night. A Reuters correspondent in Amsterdam reported that Dutch political figures have recalled that the integrity of the East Indies was guaranteed by the Allied powers, the United States, and Japan at the 1922 Washington Conference. Therefore, Japan's concern is premature, and the naval and land forces of the Dutch East Indies will make any attack on its territory extremely dangerous. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Comment on the Fate of the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Paris – Ms. Tabouis, a renowned reporter for the "L'Œuvre" newspaper, recently published an article commenting on the Dutch East Indies archipelago, stating briefly, "When Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936, Hitler offered Japan a promise that if it could conclude a treaty of alliance with Germany, the Dutch East Indies would be the reward. The German ambassador to Japan, Ott, recently reiterated this suggestion to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, but the foreign minister knew that if Germany invaded the Netherlands, the United States would take the Dutch East Indies under its protection. Upon hearing this, Japan was greatly shocked. According to the latest news, Japan is indeed very worried that the United States will get there first. Therefore, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita recently notified the Dutch government that during the current European war, Japan would not tolerate the Dutch East Indies archipelago being protected by the navy of another strong country. However, as far as the United States is concerned, the Dutch East Indies archipelago annually ships a large amount of raw materials, especially rubber, to the United States. Therefore, the United States would not welcome any invasion of these islands by Japan, even if it were a partial invasion. This is very obvious." (Havas Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris – The "People's Daily," the organ of the Socialist Party, commented on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, stating that even a large China is not enough to fill the insatiable desires of the executors of the Tanaka Memorial, as can be seen from Arita's remarks. Foreign Minister Arita stated that Japan is determined to oppose the spread of the European war to the Western Pacific and to oppose any belligerent nation controlling the Dutch East Indies archipelago. In reality, since Germany has been excluded from the Pacific, the only threat that Japan sees to these islands comes from Britain, France, or the United States. Therefore, if Germany invades the Netherlands, what will be the fate of the Dutch East Indies? Will Britain and France protect it from attack by other countries, just as they protected Iceland after Germany invaded Denmark? In fact, the Netherlands, Britain, and France have no intention of harming Japan's interests. On the contrary, if Japan takes any action against the East Indies, it will definitely cause a major reaction from the United States. As a result, Japan's economic interests in the region, even if no one actually intends to threaten them, will be completely lost because the country insists on asserting its so-called defense." (Havas Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris – "Le Figaro" newspaper here commented on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, stating briefly, "Events occurring in various parts of the world are actually interconnected. Japan has now shown its position on this issue, which is of concern to all countries, especially the United States." (Havas Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, forbidding others from interfering in the Dutch East Indies affair, have attracted much attention from officials here. However, this sentiment is not equivalent to panic. According to general opinion, Japan will think twice before acting, and will not hastily clash with Britain and France in the Far East when the Netherlands is drawn into the war. News commentators believe that Britain and France have a vital stake in the region and will act immediately, so there is no need for the United States to intervene. However, if Japan takes action against the Dutch East Indies, an uncontrollable reaction will inevitably erupt in the United States, thus strengthening the widespread sentiment against Japan's imperial ambitions in the Far East. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>New York – After Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a statement yesterday, explaining his attitude on the Dutch East Indies issue, the "People's Voice Forum" newspaper here criticized it harshly, stating briefly, "If peace in the Dutch East Indies is disrupted, Japan certainly has the right to regard this as unease, but the limit of this is exactly the same as Japan disrupting the peace of China, which Britain, the United States, and other countries also have the right to regard as unease. The two are exactly equal. Moreover, Japan's dependence on raw materials and manufactured goods produced in the Dutch East Indies is far less than that of Britain and the United States, so there is no need for Japan to interfere. In the past decade, Japan has been the main destroyer of peace in East Asia. Now, it is demanding to extend its police power to the South Seas, even to the vicinity of the Philippines. This behavior will only arouse ridicule and resentment in Britain. Moreover, Japan is already deeply mired in the quagmire of China, lacking both money and resources. If it attempts to establish naval dominance at the door of the British port of Singapore, it will inevitably collapse in the war and lose the respect it currently holds in the United States. In short, it is said that Japan is looking for a place to bury itself. If so, then the South Seas issue is probably it." (Havas Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>New York – The "New York Daily News" recently published an article expressing doubt about whether the United States can protect the Dutch East Indies, but advocating that the United States should protect the Dutch East Indies. The newspaper stated, "It is doubtful whether we can protect the Dutch East Indies from Japanese aggression. What we are concerned about with the Kingdom of the Netherlands is what will happen to the Dutch East Indies once Dutch sovereignty is extinguished in the war. Regardless of what happens to the Kingdom of the Netherlands itself, we should maintain the eternal existence of the Dutch East Indies, which is what the Monroe Doctrine should do." (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Japanese Explanation of Arita's Remarks</p>
<p>Tokyo – A Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a meeting with reporters today, answering a question about whether the Netherlands would be invaded by European belligerent countries, said that there are currently various rumors and observations about the European war spreading to that part of the world. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita made a statement (regarding Japan's position on the Dutch's involvement in the European war and its repercussions in the Dutch East Indies), stating Japan's desire to maintain the safety and peace of the Pacific region. Asked whether Arita's remarks reiterated the Four-Power Treaty of 1922, the spokesman acknowledged that the treaty was still valid and said that Arita's remarks aimed to prevent the spread of the European war to the Pacific region. The most important thing was the economic aspect of the relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. When the Japanese Diet convened a meeting, Arita, in answering questions, explicitly stated that the Japanese government was only economically concerned about the South Seas region, including the Dutch East Indies. A foreign reporter asked whether this statement was inspired by the Asian Monroe Doctrine. The spokesman replied that the term "Asian Monroe Doctrine" has been abused in many ways or used in an expanded sense. Therefore, it is inappropriate to call the spirit that inspired the Foreign Minister's statement the Asian Monroe Doctrine. The purpose of the Foreign Minister's statement is quite simple, namely to maintain Japan's special interests in the regions adjacent to its homeland. The spokesman also mentioned that Vice-Foreign Minister Masano Tani and Dutch Ambassador to Japan Pabst met yesterday afternoon, saying that this conversation was unrelated to Arita's remarks. The two talked only about routine matters. Arita invited Pabst to the Foreign Ministry half an hour after making the statement to reporters at 5:00 PM on Sunday to formally explain the content of his remarks. The Dutch ambassador then relayed this information to his home government. However, the Japanese government did not expect a response from the Dutch government, and the content of the statement was not submitted to any other foreign government. Pabst did not criticize Arita's statement. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Central Government Concerned About Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Kuomintang headquarters in charge of overseas Chinese affairs is now telling the press that, in light of Japan's possible actions in the South Seas, they are particularly concerned about the 1.3 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. The Chinese residents of the Dutch East Indies gradually migrated to this place over 2,000 years. Their investments in agriculture, banking, and insurance in the region total 400 million Dutch guilders. It is also said that the overseas Chinese residing in Java and Sumatra migrated there as early as the Han Dynasty, 2,000 years ago. Foreign military experts here say that if Japan invades, it will first occupy Borneo. The Japanese regard this place as a strategically important military location for all the islands of the Dutch East Indies. Moreover, Borneo is an area that produces large amounts of oil, which makes it even more attractive. Borneo's coal is currently operated by the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company. It is said that the company is prepared to destroy the oil wells in the event of a Japanese invasion. It is generally believed that the Japanese Navy will carefully plan how to acquire the oil of Borneo in order to prevent the destruction of the oil wells. It is also generally believed that the Japanese will first occupy Java, as Java is the political and commercial center of the Dutch East Indies. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – Excavation of the fourth Han Dynasty tomb in Jiangbei continued on the 17th. In addition to clearing sediment, a broken pottery urn was unearthed at the bottom of the tomb entrance. Also, dozens of steps away from the fourth tomb, a Han Dynasty tomb was also unearthed previously near the company during land excavation for building houses. The patterns on the bricks also included the words "" (wealth and honor). Among them, dozens of coins, one bronze tripod, two bronze basins, and fragments of bronze "" were also unearthed. The form of "" with bronze utensils proves its age. The first, second, and third Han tombs previously excavated were tombs from the late Western Han Dynasty. The patterns on the bricks of the currently excavated fourth tomb are simple and ancient, and may be tombs from the early Western Han Dynasty. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>London – British, French, and Canadian troops are continuing to land in Norway, but detailed information is being kept secret and will be released in a few days. According to political figures here, the main force of the German troops invading Norway is in the south and is trying to advance towards the center, hoping to connect with the troops currently in various Norwegian ports, paying particular attention to Trondheim. Trondheim has two railway lines, one leading to Sweden and the other to Oslo. However, the route from southern Norway to Trondheim is long and rugged, and the railway line from Trondheim to Oslo has been cut in several places by Norwegian troops, and the entire line is frequently attacked, making transportation extremely difficult. Therefore, the advance of the main German force will inevitably be hindered by Norwegian resistance, allowing the British, French, and Canadian troops to calmly land and prevent the Germans from doing as they please. The main goal of the Allied military authorities is to occupy northern Norway in order to control the North Atlantic and block the transportation routes between Norway and Sweden. This would put Swedish iron ore within easy reach and allow British and French troops to provide nearby assistance if Germany invades Sweden in the future. Therefore, Sweden was relieved to hear that British and French troops had landed in Narvik. In short, the recent victories of the British and French navies prove that the possibility of German troops in Norway receiving supplies by sea is decreasing, and they will have to rely on air transport. This means that while troop transport for the Allies may be slow, it is very convenient. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – In the early stages of the invasion of Norway, German troops advanced north to intercept King Haakon of Norway and the Norwegian government, but they are still attacking Elverum without success. According to dispatches from the Swedish border, Norwegian troops in the Elverum area are firmly defending the bridges over the Glomma River, and heavy snowfall is hindering the German mechanized units. The Norwegian troops, following the example of the Finnish troops, are sending suicide squads on sleds to harass the German troops and cut off their supply lines, while the civilians are helping to hide food. According to the "Aftonbladet" newspaper, the rearguard of the Norwegian troops withdrew from Kongsvinger yesterday, and it is expected that the German and Norwegian troops will soon engage in a decisive battle for Elverum and Hamar. It is reported that the German troops in the far southeast have occupied the entire Aust-Agder province, and the Norwegian troops will now cross the Swedish border or head north to connect with the Norwegian troops defending the eastern front. According to news from the border, "reliable sources" estimate that there are a total of 60,000 German troops in Norway. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>German Troops in Northern Norway in a Dilemma</p>
<p>Stockholm – Fierce fighting is currently taking place near the Swedish border east of Narvik in northern Norway. It is believed that the German troops have occupied the railway from Narvik to Östersund (half a mile from the Swedish border). Kongsvinger has also fallen, and a team of Norwegian troops has retreated into Sweden and been disarmed and interned. In addition, a German bomber has landed in the Swedish town of Värmlandsnäs, and the crew has also been interned. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Today, there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 German troops in Narvik, northern Norway, facing a dilemma. These 2,000+ troops are facing the choice of perishing in battle, surrendering, or fighting their way out. In the streets of Narvik, British and German troops have engaged in fierce fighting. Although a small team of German troops crossed the mountains and entered Sweden, the main force of the German troops based on the Rombak Plateau is threatened by the intense shelling of British warships and can only shorten their lines of defense. Between Narvik and the Swedish border, the bodies of German and Norwegian soldiers are strewn everywhere, most of whom have frozen to death in the snow. There are over 1,000 bodies of German, Norwegian, and British sailors and merchants at the bottom of Narvik harbor, making it a graveyard for warships and merchant ships from the three countries. One of the sunken ships is said to be a British cruiser. It is reported that all the German troops in Narvik are now isolated, and their supply lines have been cut. Their only hope is for aircraft to drop supplies to them. The British troops in Narvik are currently trying to drive the German troops towards the railway leading from Narvik through the mountains and into the snowy mountain region, where they will surround them and then bombard them with artillery from warships anchored in the Rombak Fjord. The only place for the German troops to retreat is 23 kilometers along the railway from the area where the British warships plan to bombard them. The Rombak Fjord is the entrance to this continuous snowy mountain region, and Narvik is located in the southwest corner of the fjord. Beyond the Rombak Fjord is the Rombak Plateau, which is 18 miles from the Norwegian border and has towering mountains and overlapping peaks, leaving the German troops with no way out. The railway leading to Narvik has also been damaged by Norwegian troops. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>

However, the situation has now changed, and we are no longer isolated. Britain and France have both provided us with assistance, and British troops have landed in our country. While we are waiting for the Allied forces to exert their strength, we must train our own elite troops to resist. Currently, the German troops are scattered in various locations, and without regular transportation, they cannot support each other. All the important routes are cut off by our troops, and they can only use aircraft for transport and supply, which is a very unfavorable situation. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>

The Canadian troops arrived in Finland in December last year, and their training was completed last week when the German troops invaded Norway. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>London – According to British airmen who returned from bombing the German airfield in Stavanger, Norway, a few days ago, the German side suffered heavy losses in the final air raid. It is said that British aircraft roared over the German airfield in Stavanger for an hour that night, dropping a large number of explosive and incendiary bombs on a clear moonlit night. German aircraft, air defense equipment, and other buildings parked at the airfield caught fire and burned, and the flames soared high into the sky. Although the British aircraft encountered German anti-aircraft fire, none were injured and all returned safely. The British Air Ministry also released photos taken by British aircraft of the airfield before the bombing, showing 12 German aircraft parked at the airfield. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry recently announced that "the German High Command has claimed that British aircraft lost a total of five aircraft yesterday, including a Lockheed aircraft, which was shot down while bombing Stavanger, Norway, and three Short Sunderland flying boats were destroyed by German forces. This statement is completely unfounded. In fact, none of our aircraft were shot down during our bombing of Stavanger yesterday, and we did not lose any flying boats. However, it is true that two of our aircraft patrolling the North Sea have not returned to base. It is understood that all of our aircraft that flew to Stavanger last night to bomb the German airfield were long-range heavy bombers, dropping bombs with tremendous explosive power for an hour and using incendiary bombs, causing significant damage to the airfield."

(Reuters dispatch on the 17th) Note: The "Thistle" had a displacement of 1,080 tons and was commissioned in July last year. It had a peacetime crew of 53, one 4-inch gun, two smaller guns, and ten 21-inch torpedo tubes, costing £350,000. It was of the same type as the submarine "Triton," which recently sank the German cruiser "Karlsruhe," and the "Thetis," which was lost last summer and has since been salvaged and is being repaired and recommissioned.

<p>London – Dominions Secretary Anthony Eden stated in a speech here today that Germany's war of aggression aims to make Germany the most powerful country in the world and to brutally wield this power to force Europe to submit to German rule and to force the world to accept Germany's prestige. The Allies' war aims are not only to maintain the status quo but also to maintain the possibility of progress. The nameless now view British imperialism as a murky relic of a dishonorable past, and we must eliminate this corrupt idea. In fact, this is not the case, and it is a bridge to the next era. All who acknowledge this should know that the future belongs to us, and we are not the rulers of the empire but merely its servants. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Stockholm – The Norwegian "Telegraph Agency" recently published a memorandum on the recent events, which can be compared to the official white paper published by the Norwegian government. It stated that when the German troops invaded Norway, the German envoy, Brauer, sent a note to the Norwegian government, presenting twelve demands. Foreign Minister Koht immediately replied that no country wishing to maintain its independence could accept such conditions. The German demands were as follows: (1) The Norwegian government and people must not resist Germany in any way; (2) The Norwegian government should immediately order the national army to establish friendly relations with the German army; (3) All Norwegian defenses should be placed under the control of the German army to ensure the security of Norway; (4) The Norwegian authorities should inform the German military authorities of the detailed information on the placement of mines in territorial waters; (5) When necessary, Norway should implement a blackout to prevent air raids; (6) All Norwegian transportation should be placed under German control; (7) All Norwegian merchant ships should not leave port; (8) Norwegian pilots should be available for hire by German ships; (9) All Norwegian postal and telecommunications services should be immediately suspended, pending German orders; (10) All Norwegian military resources should not be sold to foreign countries; (11) Norwegian newspapers and radio stations should be placed under German control; and (12) Norwegian telegrams should use codes so that Germany's enemies cannot obtain certain information.

<p>Oslo – Norwegians have welcomed the establishment of the Norwegian Government Commission.

The members of the commission are all social leaders, and Chairman Dr. Klinth Jensen is particularly trusted by the people. (Haitong dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Berlin – The German High Command issued a war bulletin this afternoon, describing the situation in the last 24 hours, stating that German reinforcements arrived in Norway yesterday and took measures to protect important railway lines. In the Narvik area, the railway occupied by our troops is gradually approaching the Swedish border. A small team of Norwegian troops attempted to resist and was defeated by our troops, with many captured and the rest fleeing into Sweden. The enemy has landed on Hinøya Island, 60 kilometers north of Narvik, but there have been no landing attempts near Narvik. In the Trondheim area, our troops continued to advance towards the Swedish border and occupied the railway of Midtjämten. The fighting was quiet in Bergen yesterday. British aircraft raided the vicinity of Stavanger the night before, but military targets were not damaged. In the Kristiansand area, a Norwegian artillery unit surrendered to our troops. In the Oslo area, our troops are still carrying out mopping-up operations. Railway traffic between Oslo and Kongsvinger has now been restored. Kongsvinger was occupied by our troops yesterday afternoon, and our troops are advancing north. Armored trains of our troops have arrived for combat north of Hønefoss. Commander Bonte, commander of our destroyer fleet, died defending Narvik, bravely resisting a large number of British troops, running out of ammunition and reinforcements. Northeast of the Shetland Islands, a German submarine sank a British destroyer. In the air, our troops continued to fly reconnaissance missions over the central and northern North Sea and the west coast of Norway. Despite the bad weather, German aircraft attacked the British fleet, and a heavy bomb hit a British large transport ship. In addition, a submarine and a cruiser were sunk by our aircraft 150 kilometers northwest of Molde. Near the southwest coast of Norway, our fighter planes shot down a British plane and a flying boat. One German aircraft that was conducting reconnaissance over enemy countries did not return to base.

<p>Stockholm – The "Svenska Dagbladet" recently carried a report from Moscow stating that Germany is once again seeking to form a German-Italian-Soviet alliance, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is preparing to visit Moscow for the third time to discuss this matter. It is reported that Germany has decided to allow the Soviet Union to act freely with regard to the Bessarabia province of Romania. However, Soviet political figures believe that Germany's attempt is to bring Italy and the Soviet Union closer to each other and to force Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to visit Berlin in return, which will ultimately fail. In short, although the Soviet Union is still providing economic assistance to Germany, its nature is not very important. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Paris – Observers here recently stated that Germany is concentrating troops near the Yugoslav border, the Carinthia region of Austria, and the Hungarian border. This is related to the Soviet Union's transfer of troops from Finland to the border of the Bessarabia province of Romania, and Italy's dispatch of 25,000 "tenant farmers" to Albania. Germany originally wanted to form a Berlin-Rome-Moscow triangle to maintain the status quo in the Balkans, but the current situation is the opposite. This triangle has become an element of instability in southeastern Europe. It is unknown whether the authorities of these powers have decided to take joint action, but none of them will allow the other two to gain benefits. Therefore, each country is now preparing separately to intervene immediately if one of them takes action. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated to news reporters yesterday that the U.S. has not discussed the status of the Dutch East Indies with Japan. Hull feigned ignorance of rumors that the U.S. would protect Greenland or plans for Canadian troops to land there. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Lothian stated that unless Germany attempts to establish a base in Greenland, Britain and Canada do not intend to occupy Greenland. He believes Greenland falls within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador to the U.S. Lothian, after speaking with U.S. State Department personnel yesterday, told news reporters that Britain or Canada do not intend to invade unless Germany truly seeks to seize Greenland or Iceland. Although Greenland could be a good air force base for Germany, Germany definitely cannot maintain it, as we can easily inflict a major blow there. Greenland is within the Western Hemisphere and therefore within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. He expects the British naval blockade to be applied in the Pacific to prevent supplies shipped from the American Pacific coast from entering Germany via the Soviet Union. When Secretary of State Hull was hosting news reporters, he was asked if the U.S. would extend its protection over Greenland. Hull replied that he was unaware of any such plan. However, Hull mentioned President Roosevelt's recent remarks referring to Greenland as land in the Western Hemisphere, suggesting that he clearly recognizes Greenland as being within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine.

<p>Washington – After the Icelandic government sent a note to the U.S., declaring its separation from Denmark and expressing its willingness to establish direct relations with the U.S., Secretary of State Hull promptly cabled Iceland's Prime Minister Hermann Jónasson, stating, "In the current circumstances, the U.S. government welcomes the Icelandic government's dispatch of a representative to our country, and we hope that in the near future, our country can also dispatch a representative to your country."

<p>Tokyo – It is rumored that the Soviet Union, in preparation for action in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Balkans, or the Near East, has begun negotiations with Japan to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations and secure its rear. According to a report in the Chung Wai Commercial News, Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan invited the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union on April 15th to discuss several important proposals for a general adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations. It is widely believed that these proposals are of particular significance because their purpose is to test the extent to which the Japanese government's policy of non-intervention in the expanding European war will go. The newspaper also stated that the Soviet Union, when the situation in Europe reaches a point where it can begin its active operations in Scandinavia, the Balkans, or the Near East, is eager to determine its Far Eastern policy and the security of its rear. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to a semi-official Japanese source from Harbin, the newly appointed Soviet Consul General in Harbin, when visiting the Japanese Consul General there, stated that the Soviet Union and Japan should spare no sacrifice to readjust their relations and should work together based on mutual friendship to bring the two countries closer, and that negotiations should be conducted based on the new situation in East Asia to seek a general improvement in the overall situation in East Asia. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Former Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, recently published an essay in the April issue of "Creation Magazine," advocating the signing of a five-year non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. His main points were: "Germany, after assessing the Soviet Union for a year, has trusted its sincerity and resolutely fought against Britain and France. If Japan signs a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, it can at least trust the Soviet Union within the term stipulated in the treaty. Regarding this matter, Japan can put forward three proposals: (1) Withdraw troops concentrated on both sides of the Soviet-Manchukuo border; (2) Request the Soviet government to cease aiding the Chinese Nationalist government in Chongqing; (3) Redefine the Soviet-Manchukuo border to prevent future incidents. If these proposals can be realized, then the non-aggression treaty can be easily declared. As for why some Japanese are hesitant about Germany acting as an intermediary between Japan and the Soviet Union, it is difficult to understand. In addition, it is also a matter of course for Japan to cooperate with Germany and Italy, as this move will accelerate the resolution of the 'China Incident'." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – According to reliable sources, the amount of government bonds that the Japanese government will issue in the current fiscal year, starting in April, is feared to be no less than ¥6,026,900,000. In addition, there are ¥1,700,000,000 of government bonds accumulated from last year that have not yet been issued, which will also be issued, so the total amount should be ¥7,800,000,000. Public absorption of bonds is gradually stagnating, which is a sign of inflation. Although the true power to control currency does not rest with the authorities of the Bank of Japan, they cannot be completely unrelated to the current financial situation. The Bank of Japan's surplus also greatly increased last year. It is said that the main reason for this is the increase in interest on government bonds. This artificial increase in surplus reflects the huge amount of government bonds currently outstanding. As of the end of last year, the Bank of Japan held ¥2,417,450,000 in Japanese government bonds. This number is ¥659,000,000 more than in 1938 and ¥578,000,000 more than in 1937. Although the current reserves are not small, they will continue to increase in the future. The most recent figure for Japanese government bonds held by the Bank of Japan is ¥2,544,000,000, an increase of ¥126,000,000 since the beginning of the year. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Washington – The Senate Naval Committee discussed the U.S. Navy expansion plan today, with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark presiding over the report. He advocated adding $45 million to the $965 million naval budget recently passed by the House of Representatives, to be allocated as follows: (1) $18 million to improve port facilities; (2) $27 million to build new ships, including four cruisers, thirteen destroyers, and eight submarines. Construction of these ships should begin within the next year. In addition, the Navy Department also submitted a memorandum to the committee, stating that Germany recently completed two battleships and has four more under construction. Italy recently completed two battleships and has two more under construction. Japan is currently building eight battleships, Britain is building nine, and France is building four (two of which have just been completed). The U.S. is also building eight. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – Chief of Naval Operations Stark said that Japanese naval shipbuilding has "unpleasantly" brought Japan close to parity with the United States. Stark said that if the strength of the U.S. Navy is increased by 11 percent according to the Vinson Naval Act, the ratio between the U.S. and Japan will be 5 to 4.3. If Japan continues to expand its navy at its current rate, it will be equal to the U.S. Navy in two years. He solemnly declared and requested that the Naval Committee approve an increase in naval shipbuilding to 25 percent. Naval Committee Chairman Walsh told a United Press reporter that U.S. shipbuilding could not currently be increased to 25 percent. Stark also told the committee that the U.S.'s bomb aiming devices and bombing accuracy are unmatched by any other country. (United Press, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting: Yesterday, Amendment Passed; Japanese Demand Expansion of Economic Committee; Music Team Proposal Not Discussed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers of the International Settlement was held at the Race Club yesterday at 2:30 PM, with over 4,000 attendees and several hundred observers. The majority were Europeans and Americans. Notably, European and American taxpayers arrived in small groups, while the Japanese, led by Hayashi Yukichi, entered as a group. This aligned with Japanese media reports that they would firmly oppose the new budget and increased taxes, anticipating a tense meeting. The British and Americans had also been preparing for days to counter with full force. However, the Japanese only proposed expanding the membership of the Public Works Department's Economic Committee to twelve. The new budget and increased tax issues were all passed. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Well-Organized Meeting Arrangements</p>
<p>Authorities closely monitored this year's meeting, anticipating a large turnout. Therefore, arrangements to maintain order were meticulously planned. Above the north-facing main gate of the racecourse, a sign indicating vehicle entry was hung high. The gate near Rue Massenet was designated for taxpayer entry and exit. Above this gate, a white banner reading "Annual Meeting of Taxpayers" was stretched across the Avenue du Roi Albert to attract taxpayers' attention. At the entrance to the racecourse, four Chinese and Indian constables stood guard. Inside, around the meeting venue, over fifty Chinese, English, Japanese, and Indian police officers formed a security perimeter, standing guard with strict precautions. Dedicated personnel were stationed at the meeting entrance to check the identification documents of attending taxpayers. An information desk was set up nearby for taxpayer inquiries. The meeting was held in the racecourse grandstand. However, a temporary shed was erected in front of the grandstand as a platform for the chairman. On either side of the chairman's platform, short fences formed "For" and "Against" areas. Since counting raised hands would be difficult, these were set up for taxpayers to automatically walk into the appropriate area during voting.</p>
<p>Eight Items on the Meeting Agenda</p>
<p>The meeting agenda, proposed by Fessenden and others, consisted of eight items: (1) Elect Sir Allan Mossop, British High Court Judge in China, as Chairman of the Meeting; (2) Elect Mr. Nash as Secretary of the Meeting; (3) Adopt the valid Rules of Procedure from the previous year's meeting; (4) Elect Mr. Gillon as a member of the Land Commission; (5) Elect Mr. Carnie, Mr. Herly, Dr. Duncan, and Dr. Balson as Directors of the Public Hospital; (6) Approve the 1939 report and accounts; (7) Approve and adopt the 1940 budget expenditures proposed by the current board, together with the attached recommendations, and authorize the Public Works Department to levy and collect the proposed taxes and fees. Further, if deemed appropriate, authorize the Public Works Department to raise funds not exceeding 16 million yuan, or the equivalent in other currencies, to be used for various purposes specified in the temporary expenditure budget; (8) Adopt the already published new Rules of Procedure, which will remain in effect until the next annual meeting.</p>
<p>Summary of Fessenden's Speech</p>
<p>Fessenden, Chairman of the Public Works Department, delivered a lengthy speech. He first requested the assembly to pass the department's report and accounts. Regarding the 51% increase in the general municipal tax, he detailed the difficult economic situation and urged taxpayers to approve it. He also addressed criticisms of unfairness and provided detailed explanations. Additionally, he reported on (1) negotiations regarding road construction beyond the boundaries of the Western District, (2) recovery of police authority in the Northern District, (3) the food supply problem, (4) sheltering refugees and beggars, (5) last year's accounts, and (6) this year's budget. The last year's accounts and this year's budget were detailed in particular. The full text will be published in another section of this newspaper and will be completed in daily installments. The above is a summary.</p>
<p>Increased Tax Proposal Passed</p>
<p>Items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) on the agenda were all passed smoothly. However, the situation became tense during the discussion of Item (7). Japanese taxpayer Hayashi Yukichi proposed an emergency motion to pass the budget if the Public Works Department's Economic Committee was strengthened by expanding its membership to twelve, including two Britons, two Japanese, two Americans, two Chinese, one German, one Italian, one French, and one Dutch member. The committee's authority would be to study areas of Public Works Department administration that should be revised, and the Public Works Department should express its willingness to fully accept the committee's recommendations. The assembly then passed the 1940 budget, and Fessenden announced a 50% tax increase starting next year. It was also decided to expand the membership of the Public Works Department's Economic Committee to twelve.</p>
<p>Music Team to Continue</p>
<p>Regarding the Public Works Department's music team, Mr. Quessel suggested that the Public Works Department budget could be approved, but the music team's funding should be cancelled and a subsidy of 30,000 yuan should be given by the Public Works Department. This proposal was not brought up for discussion when the budget was passed. Finally, Mr. Quessel rose and explained his reasons in detail, but the latter part of his speech was drowned out by shouts from the crowd. Opposition was voiced by Mr. Harris and Mr. Arnold. They stated that the Public Works Department's music team only consumed one-half of one percent of the entire budget, while education consumed ten percent. Similarly, a large number of residents did not directly benefit from the music team and educational facilities. Therefore, they believed that the education sector should also be cancelled. If it was not to be cancelled, then there was no reason to cancel the music team.</p>
<p>Authorities Expressly Forbid Gambling</p>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, Mr. Shalekin, a Russian lawyer, suggested that the Public Works Department could levy taxes on "slot machines" in the settlement. He claimed that if 1,000 "slot machines" were taxed at 100 yuan each month, 1,200,000 yuan could be obtained annually, which could supplement the Public Works Department's financial shortfall. In response, Fessenden stated that the Public Works Department fundamentally opposed gambling. Any business of a gambling nature would absolutely not be allowed to exist within the settlement. He also stated that the gambling issue remained serious.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson Expresses Views</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Japanese embassy spokesperson stated at a press conference that if the proposal made by Hayashi Yukichi at the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting was rejected, it would cause unpleasant results. The spokesperson stated that the Japanese proposal was to request the establishment of a "revision committee" to review the finances and administrative facilities of the Public Works Department. The Japanese believed that this request was very reasonable and up-to-date, beneficial not only to the Japanese but also to other foreign nationals. He continued that if the 51% increase in the municipal tax was passed, the current difficult problem could be temporarily resolved, but difficulties would still exist in the next accounting year. Finally, the Japanese recognized that there was no need to object to the proposed budget being passed. Therefore, to reduce difficulties, the Japanese suggested passing this budget. The Japanese still opposed the 50% tax increase, but they were well aware that the result would cause various difficulties and confusion, which would be quite inconvenient for the settlement's administration. The spokesperson concluded that the British and American foreigners were most afraid of being defeated by the Japanese yesterday.</p>

<p>— Quan</p>
<p>The sun squatted in the clouds, unable to exert its power, quietly shrouding the entire earth in gray, even though Avenue du Roi Albert and Rue Massenet were so lively.</p>
<p>A white banner reading "Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers" hung across the entrance of the Race Club. The reporter passed through the police cordon and entered the meeting venue, found a seat in the press area, calmed down, and quietly read the proposed agenda. At the Dragon Gate of the racecourse and the entrance of the New World, white banners reading "Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers" were also hung, fluttering in the wind. Carriages, like a long snake, were driving into the racecourse one after another. The arrangement inside the venue included a temporary wooden platform facing the grandstand. The platform was filled with various fresh flowers. Three microphones broadcast the speeches of various directors. The seats in the grandstand were covered with long boards, these were the seats for the foreign taxpayers. The wind was howling on all sides. Although it was spring, it was still strangely cold on the face. Several blue-eyed taxpayers pulled up the collars of their coats.</p>
<p>At exactly 2:30 PM, Chairman Fessenden first read the agenda. After the chairman and secretary were selected, the most important item was item seven. Undoubtedly, all parties paid close attention to item seven - the Public Works Department's tax increase proposal for the current year. Surrounded by Japanese newspaper reporters, Japanese taxpayer Hayashi Yukichi walked onto the stage. Mr. Hayashi Tetsuo, a translation official, also walked onto the stage behind Hayashi Yukichi, leaning on a cane with a limp. At that time, the atmosphere of the entire venue became tense. Japanese reporters were busy taking pictures, and the Japanese foreigners at the venue were applauding to signal their support. Mr. Hayashi spoke in Japanese. The reporter saw the Japanese taxpayers applauding in waves. Later, Hayashi Tetsuo translated it into English. Only then did he know that Mr. Hayashi was advocating a revision to item seven, expanding the organizational structure of the current Public Works Department's Finance Committee, increasing the number of Chinese, American, British, and Japanese committee members by two each, and French, German, Italian, and Dutch members by one each, as a condition for passing item seven. Later, McNaughten's speech and Quessel of the Far Eastern News Agency's opposition to the Public Works Department's existing music team to save money did not receive sympathy from the Westerners at the venue, who used "boos" to show their opposition. Both McNaughten and Quessel seemed to have been rebuffed and were finally rejected by the taxpayers. It seemed that the foreign taxpayers did not care about the 50% increase. After item seven was passed, the atmosphere of the entire venue relaxed a lot.</p>
<p>The sky deliberately made things difficult. Fine drizzle was falling non-stop. The wind god added to the turmoil and exerted its power on the taxpayers in the open air. As a result, one-third of the foreigners left the venue before the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese foreigners were sitting on the second tier of the north grandstand, in the front row of the press area. They did not seem to feel any pain or itching regarding items one to six, and they remained silent and did not express anything. The nine directors of the Public Works Department were all wearing formal attire. Chairman Fessenden's speech was loud and clear, while Sir Allan Mossop's was lower. Keswick was calm and frequently stood up to second Fessenden's proposals. The foreigners and newspaper reporters at the venue, except for the reporter, were all in Western suits. Last year, Mr. Yan and Mr. Zhu's Chinese clothing accompanied them, but this year I was the only one! A smile.</p>
<p>The clock pointed to 5:00 PM before embarking on the return journey. However, the "rain" and "wind" continued to wreak havoc. A tense and eye-catching annual meeting of foreign taxpayers also closed in the wind and rain.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Summary of the Speech by the Chairman of the Public Works Department at the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting (1) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>As the Chairman of the Public Works Department, I am responsible for presenting item six, which is to pass the department's report and accounts up to December 31, 1939. Last year's achievements can be considered quite satisfactory. However, it would be incorrect to say that everything in the city is currently perfect. In the past year, the department has achieved more than one success in its facilities. Reflecting on the past and looking forward to the future, we are even more determined to exert ourselves. The department's budget for this year includes a 51% increase in the general municipal tax and various taxes and fees. This is regrettable not only for everyone but also for all departments of the Public Works Department. However, there is indeed a need to ask everyone to approve it. Currently, everyone's expenditure on various goods and necessities has almost certainly exceeded 50% compared to the past. Here is a matter for everyone to know. The Public Works Department's total recurrent expenditure budget for this year is less than half of the Shanghai Power Company's expenditure on coal alone this year. We enjoy many benefits provided by the municipal authorities on weekdays, and the taxes and fees that the municipal authorities intend to levy on us this time are only 50%, which should be considered fortunate. As for this tax increase, it is indeed necessary. Let me elaborate. Some say that Shanghai cannot be compared with Western cities. However, I have not seen Western cities spend 40% of their total municipal expenditure on police affairs. Let's take "Newcastle" in England as an example. The expenditure on police affairs there is only one-tenth of the total municipal expenditure, half of which is still subsidized by the state. Some criticize that the administrative expenses of the International Settlement are not as thrifty and economical as those of the French Concession. However, the Public Works Department pays more than three million yuan annually for prison maintenance and more than three million yuan for education expenses, which the French Concession does not bear. Some say that the department's treatment of its employees is too generous. According to the provisions of the Land Regulations, the department is responsible for hiring employees, determining salaries, and signing employment contracts. I personally believe that the treatment of the department's employees cannot be said to be too generous. Moreover, the temporary cost of living allowance should be increased again in the future. When the draft budgets for each department this year were submitted to the committees for review, the department earnestly warned that austerity should be implemented. Through the efforts of the committees and the sincere cooperation of the heads of each department, the draft budget was reduced by several million yuan. At the same time, it was considered that there was no impact on administrative efficiency. There is a certain basis for reducing administrative expenses. Beyond this, the administrative structure will be in danger of degeneration, relaxation, and unsoundness, which is not a good policy. However, in order to strive for thrift, the department has reorganized a special committee to further study ways to economize.</p>
<p>The department's annual report for the previous year has been printed. In addition to describing various important department affairs over the past year, it also lists the issues discussed by the various committees over the past year, as suggested by a taxpayer at the last annual meeting, detailing the regular work handled by each committee.</p>
<p>Negotiations in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>At the last annual meeting, there was a proposal to ask the Bureau to make every effort to improve the situation in the area outside the boundary of Western Shanghai because of its poor situation. At that time, because the negotiations in the area were still in progress, there was a need to keep the content of the negotiations confidential, so it was not possible to answer immediately. The Western District problem has been agreed with the Bureau to establish an agreement. The full text of the agreement must have been known to you early on, and I am convinced that the improvement of the situation in the area will see a rapid turnaround. As for the details, they are still under discussion and are expected to proceed smoothly to a satisfactory resolution. Those of you who reside in the area, your tolerance is commendable. The interests of you in the area have not been forgotten by the current directors, and the new directors should also pay close attention to them.</p>
<p>Police Authority in the Northern District</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of recovering police authority in the Northern District north of the Suzhou Creek, the Bureau has reached an agreement with the Japanese authorities, stipulating that all police authority in the district will be returned to the Bureau, and a new police district will be established. The district chief will be selected and appointed by a Japanese national and will be under the jurisdiction of the Bureau's police department. The establishment of the agreement can be said to be a concrete step in restoring the normal state of the district. At the same time, the real interests of the white-籍taxpayers in the district will be recognized in the real world.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Guerrilla Warfare on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road; New Fourth Army Mobilizes; Fierce Battle Lasts Two Days and Nights, Japanese Army Suffers Defeat; Japanese Aircraft Fly West Yesterday, Japanese Army Has Not Withdrawn; Japanese Army Massacres Villagers, Injured Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Qibao Town, west of Shanghai, after suffering a disastrous defeat in the ambush at Huangyang Branch Bridge while attacking the guerrilla team of Gu Fuxing in Dujia Hang the day before, the Japanese side dispatched a large team of Japanese soldiers on the morning of the 14th, in 23 trucks, and allocated four tanks to assist in the battle, turning from the Great Western Road and Hongqiao Road onto the Shanghai-Qingpu Road. When they got off at Xujing Town and walked to the vicinity of Zhaoxiang, they suddenly encountered the Gu team coming. The two sides immediately engaged in a fierce battle. From morning to noon, after more than five hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese side was unable to support and began to collapse. Before leaving, they set fire along the way and burned more than 100 civilian houses. The Japanese army suffered two defeats in a row, and then mobilized the Japanese troops from Songjiang, Xinzhuang, Hongqiao, Qibao, Qingpu, Nanxiang, and Beixinjing, attempting a large-scale encirclement and attack. Fortunately, the New Fourth Army heard about it and allocated troops to assist in the battle, while the southern Japanese soldiers from Songjiang and Xinzhuang were blocked by Tian and Yao. Gu himself commanded and fought bravely, not allowing them to retreat. Those who violated the order would be beheaded, causing dense gunfire and artillery sounds all day long, clearly audible in the suburbs. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered more than 50 casualties, and many more Chinese sacrificed themselves. Seeing that the task had been completed, the Gu Detachment Commander safely withdrew the night before. Now the Japanese side still intends to engage in battle again, so they have not withdrawn. Yesterday, nine aircraft were dispatched to fly west. Details are not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Bridges on the Songqing Road Have Been Destroyed</p>
<p>According to people from Qingpu, Tianma Mountain, Yu Mountain, and Kunshan connected to Songjiang in the south of the county are important strongholds on the Songqing Road. The bridges on the Songqing Road were completely destroyed by our army when they withdrew to the west. After the Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Tianma and Sheshan this time, they forced civilians to repair them. The original guerrilla team stationed in the area had high morale and good discipline. They usually got along well with the people like fish and water. A few days ago, the detachment took advantage of a night with no light, secretly dispatched strong troops to attack the Japanese and puppet garrisons in Sijing, Tianma Mountain, and Sheshan, and at the same time, according to the predetermined plan, set fire to the newly repaired bridges on the Songqing Road or pried off the bridge decks and destroyed them all. When the detachment launched the attack, it was late at night. The Japanese and puppets heard the alarm in their dreams and responded hastily, not knowing what was happening. After contacting for about two or three hours, more than ten Japanese and puppet soldiers were wounded and killed. Before dawn, they withdrew safely and turned into smaller units. When the Japanese and puppets went to search the next morning, they found nothing.</p>
<p>Villagers Injured Come to Shanghai for Medical Treatment</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that a villager from Wumu Bridge near Hongqiao Airport suffered multiple stab wounds on his back and neck. On the night of the 16th, he was admitted to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to the villager, on the night of the 15th, the Japanese army broke into the village and dragged out twenty villagers to question them about the activities of the guerrillas. After questioning, they stabbed the twenty people with guns. Eight of them had already died from serious injuries. Several others were seriously injured. The person concerned took a detour to Shanghai to avoid being seen by the Japanese soldiers. It was also reported that on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road, the day before yesterday (the 14th), when the Japanese army attempted to encircle the guerrillas there, the two sides engaged in a battle, and the battle was quite fierce. A Qingpu villager, Yang Jici (24 years old), was passing through Panlong when he was hit in the right waist by a stray machine gun bullet from the Japanese side, penetrating his back. His condition was very serious. At 6:30 PM yesterday, he was escorted to Shanghai and admitted to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Second Issue of National Defense Bonds; Payment at the End of the Month; Overseas Payments Made by the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Hong Kong, Deducted for a Period of Three Years, Expiring After That <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>For the purpose of raising military supplies for the War of Resistance, the National Government issued 500 million yuan of National Defense Bonds on May 1, 1928, designating the entire income tax revenue as security for principal and interest, and ordering the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance to allocate the amount of principal and interest due in each period according to the principal and interest repayment schedule and transfer it to the central bank. The income was credited to the public bond account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee for special storage and reserve payment. A New Sound Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that the first payment of principal and interest on the National Defense Bonds will be made from April 30th by the Central Bank and the banks entrusted by the Common Commission as the payment agencies. The foreign part will be paid by the original receiving bank to the China and Communications banks in Hong Kong on behalf of the payment. The above-mentioned winning bonds and expired interest coupons will be deducted for a period of three years from the date of commencement of payment. If they are not collected within the time limit, they will be invalidated and no longer paid. The interest coupons attached to the bonds drawn this time, from the third to the fifty-eighth issues, should be returned to the bank by the bondholder together with the principal when taking the principal. If there is a shortage, it will be deducted from the principal payable.</p>

<p>The Huamin Wheel, managed by the Japanese-owned Huadong Shipping Bureau in this city, loaded passengers and cargo from Dinghai Shenjiamen on the 13th of this month. When it sailed to the Jintan waters that night, it suddenly encountered a storm and hit a reef, causing it to sink. Some of the passengers were unable to escape and drowned miserably. The rest boarded the reef and were transported to Shanghai by the Antong Wheel. It is now known that the ship arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and berthed at the 24th pontoon of the Huangpu River. According to the company, a total of more than 210 passengers were rescued and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to investigations, there are still more than 90 passengers unaccounted for, mostly women and children. Because after the ship hit the reef, the seawater surged into the bottom of the ship, and the hull soon sank. Most of the young and strong passengers escaped ashore, while the elderly, weak, women, and children were unable to escape and were buried in the ship. The captain of the ship felt that his measures were inappropriate and fled. It is said that the company is still investigating the responsibility for the accident. The aftermath for passengers and the salvaging of the sunken ship are also being planned.</p>

It is expected that this precedent of allowing foreigners to voluntarily join the army may be followed. However, when the volunteers will depart and how they will reach the Scandinavian Peninsula has not been disclosed.</p>

These German residents were the German official commercial news agency, Mr. Georg Molck of the Chemical Propaganda Department of the Chemical Company, Mr. Harms, a representative of German manufacturers, and Mr. Haffmann, a German businessman. Other German residents in the French Concession have not yet received the same notice.

<h3 id="e62">Chinese Employees of the British Shanghai Gas Company Demand Increased Benefits; Present Demands and Await Reply; Work Stoppage Orderly <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The entire workforce of over a thousand workers at the British Shanghai Gas Company's main factory at 565 Yu Qiaqing Road, due to the recent soaring prices in Shanghai, find it difficult to maintain their livelihoods with their monthly wages. Left with no choice, they requested an increase in wages and rice subsidies from the company authorities, but without success. As a result, all the workers stopped work in the morning. All the Chinese staff members, also demanding the company improve their benefits without a satisfactory response, also stopped work yesterday. According to a report by a Pingming News Agency reporter, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seven Demands</p>
<p>The workers of the British Shanghai Gas Company's main factory presented the company with seven formal demands yesterday morning for increased wages and rice subsidies: (1) Increase wages by 30%; (2) If the price of rice is above 20 yuan, the company should provide rice subsidies based on the highest price; if it is below 20 yuan, the company can cancel the rice subsidies; (3) The company should increase wages by 10% annually (the company originally had a 10% increase every three years, but it has been four years since the last increase); (4) Wages should be paid during holidays; (5) Workers should not be dismissed without special fault; (6) If the employer wants to lay off workers, they should pay six months of severance pay, and wage savings should also be calculated; (7) The employer should pay year-end bonuses equivalent to one month's salary. The above demands were presented to the Chief Engineer, Mr. Samuelson, by worker representatives at 3:00 PM yesterday, and all the workers are awaiting a reply in good order. It is reported that the workers at the Yangshupu branch of the company will also follow up with demands, echoing the workers at the main factory.</p>
<p>Workers' Hardships</p>
<p>According to the workers of the company, workers work more than nine hours a day in the company, and the highest wage is 1.35 yuan per day. No wages are paid on Sundays and holidays, and only half a day's wage is paid on Saturdays. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the cost of living in Shanghai has risen, and prices have soared. Workers struggle to make a living. They previously requested the company to increase rice subsidies, and the company did provide a temporary subsidy of two yuan per month. Later, as the price of rice fell slightly, the temporary subsidy was cancelled. Recently, the price of rice has soared again, and the workers are struggling to make a living. They have no choice but to ask the company to improve their benefits again, hoping that the company authorities will understand the workers' difficulties and resolve the issue satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Staff Demands</p>
<p>It is also reported that after the rice price soared, the company has already provided Chinese staff with a subsidy, equivalent to 25% of their salary. As the cost of living is currently high, the staff are finding it difficult to make ends meet. They have also made demands to the company's manager, Mr. Brown: (1) Request that the subsidy be increased to 50%; (2) When the price of rice exceeds 20 yuan, the company must subsidize one-half; (3) Request annual salary increases; (4) There should be three weeks of annual leave; (5) The company should provide an additional 10% of salary monthly for savings, with compound interest calculated every six months. At the time, Secretary Brown made no statement. Therefore, the staff (including those in the general office, Jing'an Temple, Xiafei Road, Hongkou, and the factory) also stopped work at 4:00 PM yesterday, awaiting a resolution.</p>

<p>Gambling with flower games is prevalent in Nanshi, causing severe harm. Although the bosses of the gambling dens in the puppet government have been actively seeking opportunities in recent days, rumors of reopening the venues has been circulating. However, as of the 17th, this has not been realized.</p>
<p>Another report states that flower game gambling is prevalent in Nanshi, with public listings soliciting customers, causing severe harm. All the gambling dens in the puppet government, since being closed, have been repeatedly rumored to be reopening. As of the 16th, this has not been realized. Only the gambling table of the Dali Company at No. 11 Xima Street, Fangbang Bridge, has changed its name to Dali Canteen, advertising with red paper signs, but these were suddenly torn down yesterday. At the same time, in addition to the Carlton General Association at No. 72 Fangbangyu, which had been closed by the military police, the Nanshi "Court" also posted notices of closure yesterday, announcing the pursuit of the gambling leaders. However, the Sanxin Theater on Minguo Road was completely renovated long ago, and yesterday afternoon, the doors were suddenly opened, allowing people to visit. The bottom floor is a small theater with extremely poor lighting and air quality. The delay in opening is probably due to licensing issues.</p>

<p>The "Mulan Joins the Army" film produced by Xinhua Company was robbed and burned during its first screening on the first day at the only major theater in Chongqing. Subsequently, newspapers in Chongqing published articles criticizing the film. In addition to the Chongqing government arresting the perpetrators at the time, it also telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to investigate the matter locally. Chongqing has now received details of the investigation by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, which refuted all the accusations. The new copy of the film began its glorious rescreening at the Chongqing People's Grand Theater on the 10th of this month, with unprecedented success. Chongqing's Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, and Shishi Xinbao all simultaneously published messages refuting the false accusations against the film and the producing company.</p>

<p>Cheng Yinwu, a native of Suzhou and owner of the Fukang Money Exchange at 119-121 Tianjin Road in the Public Concession, was over 50 years old. He usually enjoyed raising birds and lived at No. 41, Lane 848, Kangnuot Road (i.e., Kang Village) in western Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Cheng Yinwu carried a birdcage alone and was enjoying tea at the</p>
<p>Longyuan Tea House</p>
<p>on Yu Qiaqing Road. While chatting happily with other tea drinkers, four thugs suddenly appeared. One of them was a foreigner. They went upstairs to Cheng Yinwu's table, and two thugs drew handguns to threaten him, while another dragged Cheng up and handcuffed him, binding his hands. The three thugs</p>
<p>Dragged and Pushed</p>
<p>Cheng downstairs and forced him into a car parked by the roadside, which sped away to the north. Afterwards, Fukang Money Exchange immediately reported the incident by telephone to his son, Cheng Zeheng, who is currently a lawyer at a law</p>
<p>office at No. 533 Rue Massenet in the French Concession.</p>
<p>His Son Received the Report</p>
<p>and was greatly shocked. He immediately reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate the scene. The police are currently investigating the reasons for Cheng's abduction.</p>

<p>The Chinese and foreign detectives of the General Police Department previously arrested 39 major bandits, including Wei Shoulin, in the concession.

Once they are verified, additional charges will be filed. As for Gu Zhuxuan's suspected involvement, it is related to the murder case of Wu Qilun. It is alleged that this case was instigated by Gu. This case was tried yesterday morning by Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division of the First Court, with the courtroom filled with spectators.

<h3 id="e67">The Lament of the Poor: The Municipal Council Increases Public Bus Fares; Attempts to Curb Rising Prices Have No Effect <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The English-language newspaper North China Daily News published a letter yesterday signed by "Seriously Affected," stating that as the Municipal Council's taxes are about to increase and life is becoming increasingly difficult, it is shameful that the Municipal Council has approved a 45% increase in public bus fares. It is recalled that a few weeks ago, your newspaper stated that the Public Bus Company did not intend to increase fares. This fare increase has severely impacted the poor. Unless fares and surcharges are reduced in the near future, the unfortunate poor may flock to the Huangpu River to end their lives. The report on the 15th stated that the Municipal Council's announcement to curb the rise in major commodities is a waste of time, and no one benefits from it. Prices have already risen so high that speculators can easily make huge profits.</p>

<p>Yu Yushan, a young Shanghai man, age 24, residing at No. 52 Yongqing Lane, Xinda Gu Road, works at the Japanese-owned Mitsui Yoko. Because his appearance resembles that of the comedic film actor Han Lan'gen, and he enjoys frequenting dance halls, the dancers all call him Han Lan'gen. In early February of this year, Yu met Xie Lianping (age 19, residing at No. 5, Tang Village, Pingjili Road, French Concession), the daughter of Xie Dougong, the former magistrate of Xi'an County, Anhui Province, at the Wuweizhai snack bar in the Great World. They fell in love and began to visit each other. On February 21st of this year, they got engaged at the New Capital Hotel and chose the 27th of this month to get married. However, Yu suddenly discovered that his fiancée, Xie Lianping,</p>
<p>Had Committed Theft</p>
<p>Of other people's diamond rings, and had been arrested by the French police. With this dishonorable fact, how could he continue to spend his life with her? He then hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to file a lawsuit in the Special Second Court against Xie Lianping to terminate the engagement, requesting mediation first. The Special Second Court mediated, but the mediation failed. Yu then formally filed a complaint. Before the trial of the termination case opened, Xie Lianping, with</p>
<p>Disrupting the Family</p>
<p>As well as a civil suit, claiming that Yu had taken her daughter away from her family through seduction. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the fourth criminal court to summon them. Yu Yushan also hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to appear in court and filed a counterclaim for defamation, claiming that the plaintiff maliciously damaged the defendant's reputation in the newspapers, accusing the defendant of deceiving Jiang Jianqiu's brother, and therefore requested that she be punished according to law and that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. According to Xie Lianping's testimony, from November 13th of last year to March 3rd of this month, she had illicit relations with the defendant three times at Room 612 of the Yangtze Hotel and Room 206 of the Great Eastern Hotel, etc. Because the articles of the plaintiff's complaint required the condition of leaving parental authority, she was asked whether she went home after having relations with the defendant or going out with the defendant. She replied that she did. The court interrogated.</p>
<p>Yu Yushan Testified</p>
<p>That the reason for terminating the engagement with the plaintiff's daughter was because she had committed a dishonorable act. The plaintiff's daughter claimed that she had illicit relations three times, but this was not true. The plaintiff's complaint was entirely intended to resist my civil case. As for the request for 50,000 yuan in consolation money, I have no ability to pay it and no reason to pay it. I should ask the court to declare me innocent and dismiss the plaintiff's civil suit. Judge Meng considered that further investigation was necessary in this case and ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cash 'cooked red' grey market situation reversed downwards, mainly due to unfavorable environmental factors, coupled with the general floating households being forced to sell off due to the three-day deadline for redemption of collateral loans. It opened down 8 yuan at 5,830 yuan. Not long after, money changers still had some interest in buying, absorbing a limited amount, and once rose to 5,845 yuan. However, soon after, the foreign exchange market became loose, and news of the victory in the Nanchang battle, as well as the aforementioned reasons, sparked a large number of sellers, with securities firms and Yu Heng taking the largest volume, and banks also selling. The price then dropped to 5,775 yuan. Although there was a slight pull in the middle, by noon, securities firms continued to sell heavily, and the selling pressure remained strong, falling again to 5,748 yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon, and the market closed at 5,750 yuan, down 88 yuan compared to yesterday.

<p>From the morning 'mother bar' (ten taels), the opening market situation was still flat. The opening price was slightly suppressed by 8 yuan. A securities firm sold to a bank for 5,830 yuan. Later, a money changer suddenly came to search and buy, and raised the price by 15 yuan. The money changer bought ten taels from the securities firm for 5,845 yuan. After that, because the US exchange rate slightly loosened, and there was talk of HSBC and other outside firms urging redemption of collateral loans, the selling pressure suddenly increased. Securities firms were particularly strong in dumping, and gold shops and banks also sold, dropping by 70 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to the money changer for 5,775 yuan. At that time, another money changer saw the low price and slightly absorbed, recovering 15 yuan. The money changer bought 20 taels from the gold shop for 5,790 yuan. However, not long after, a securities firm came to dump again, plus the banks selling again, falling another 42 yuan. The gold shop sold 40 taels to the money changer for a low price of 5,748 yuan.

<h3 id="e80">Foreign Exchange Turns Stable <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates turned loose. The public generally held bullish sentiment towards exchange rates, so there were many who sold off profits throughout the day. The morning opened with China Bank forcefully selling, and there was a lack of buyers at one point, so the market appeared hardened, and the $6 US exchange rate could be settled at that time. Not long after, Sassoon suddenly became interested in buying, and foreign telegrams from Mumbai suddenly came to purchase forward British gold, but outside firms provided good supply, and the market situation remained stable. Subsequently, China Bank continued to sell, while American banks absorbed, and the situation did not change. Later, speculators entered the market to buy some, and trading gradually became sparse. Until noon, it slightly softened, and as a result, British gold closed at 4/125, and the US exchange rate was 5.96875, which was still flat compared to the British gold of the previous day, and the US exchange rate loosened by 0.03125. The futures all reported a slight hardening, and the potential trend was the same as the spot market.</p>

China Bank sold the May US dollar to foreign banks for 5.6875 to 71875, and the April US dollar for 5.9375. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The balance tax on silver was announced at half a yuan. After that, Sassoon and a foreign telegram from Mumbai suddenly came to buy forward British gold. Because it was beneficial, the British gold still reported stability. It was estimated that May British gold was traded at 3/890625. Subsequently, China Bank continued to sell, and the public was bullish on exchange rates, so although there were American and other absorptions, buying and selling still felt balanced. It was estimated that China Bank sold the April US dollar to foreign banks for 5.9375 and 90625, and China Bank sold the May US dollar to American banks for 5.6875. Until noon, speculators slightly absorbed, so there was a slight recovery.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation suddenly weakened, due to the widespread rumors of the recovery of Nanchang, gold prices plummeted, and British and American gold also fell sharply. The US dollar bill market trended downward, retreating to 16 yuan, 5 corners, and 6 points in the evening, a decline of 1 corner and 2 points compared to the previous day. The British gold bill, on the other hand, was slightly higher due to the tight forward British exchange rate in the black market, so the demand was not weak, and the market price rose slightly. Hong Kong bills softened slightly along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills were supplied continuously, and market prices continued to decline. The former retreated to 1 yuan, 3 corners, 1 point, and 2 mils, and the latter fell to 1 yuan, 0 points, and 4 mils and 5 hairs. Everything else remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Food: Rice Prices Fluctuate Greatly <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the magnitude of the changes in rice prices has been constantly beyond expectations. Tracing back to the previous Guan rise, the highest peak of No. 1 Saigon once reached 47 yuan and a half, and then suddenly fell to around 40 yuan. This time, due to the soaring gold prices, it suddenly rose again within a week, advancing day by day, restoring the previous high peak, rising by as much as 7 or 8 yuan, which is truly an unprecedented change in the rice market. There were even more changes yesterday. It initially fell and then rose, and then fell and rose again. In the morning, both buyers and sellers were briefly softened, and because of the high prices, the origin prices were close, and the thinking was slightly inferior. There was no inquiry from the guest no shop customers, but floating traders and retail households had their usual thinking and acted accordingly, selling and buying to adapt to the situation, and it was particularly active. For example, No. 1 Saigon only opened at 47 yuan, and small grain at 42 yuan and 6 corners, a decrease of half a yuan to nearly one yuan compared to the previous session. After this guest sold and then took action, one action led to a hundred actions, and it became lively, and the market rose accordingly, and then returned to the original session. Subsequently, buying and selling were quite strong, and those who made profits returned to sell, and those who padded empty bought in, each according to their own thinking. The overall market situation in the mid-market formed a balance between supply and demand, and after a long delay, the market atmosphere gradually weakened and the sales market slackened, turning soft again. The price of each commodity fell again. Just when the small grain fell to 43 yuan at the close, a general thinker took advantage of the cheapness to suddenly advance, and the market suddenly increased by half a yuan. No. 1 Saigon was still 47 yuan and a half, and small grain was 43 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The thick and thin japonica rice in the off-site market was the same, lacking prosperity or disgrace. Changbang japonica still opened at 46 or 7 yuan, medium 44 or 5 yuan, Qingsi extra thin 46 yuan, Gao City 45 yuan and a half, 45 yuan, Nangang early and late rice 43 or 4 yuan. Only glutinous rice was far away from other goods in terms of selling price, the lowest, and many large households hoarded it, so the current market was not affected by foreign rice and continued to rise by more than half a yuan. Kai Luan Yang special yuan 40 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan special since 39 yuan, 6 or 7 corners, decided to 37 yuan and a half. According to statistics, the arrival of japonica and glutinous rice was imported into the boundary by Hongkou Dachang Company, with another two or three thousand packages.</p>
<p>Foreign rice initially strengthened and then fell, and the market situation gradually tended to recover. When the market opened in the early morning, the market rumored that a Chinese businessman's 2,700 tons of No. 1 or 2 Saigon were loaded on the Norwegian and Danish rounds to Shanghai and were blocked in Hong Kong halfway, so the atmosphere suddenly became tense and people were optimistic. Although there were large households secretly dumping, the current foreign rice was hoarded and raised by the local guest lines to 5, 6, or 7 corners. Then it was rumored that Nanchang had been recovered, and those who profited took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and the market immediately trended downward, with prices falling by 3, 5, or 6 corners. The selling momentum was even stronger in the afternoon, and prices continued to be reduced by half a yuan. The early market for No. 1 Saigon was 48 yuan, and it had fallen to 47 yuan in the afternoon. The early market for No. 1 road goods was 55 yuan and 7 corners, and it was still difficult to sell at 55 yuan in the afternoon. The early market for No. 2 April or May was 54 yuan and a half, and it fell to 53 yuan and a half in the afternoon. That is, Siamese had opened at 53 yuan and 2 corners. A total of 525 tons of foreign rice was opened throughout the day, and there were 8 or 9,000 packages of spot goods.</p>
<p>Wuxi rice and paddy are flowing from various sources in recent days, and market prices are expected to be flat and loose. However, unexpectedly, the Shanghai rise continues. A Japanese business group company entrusted the Wuxi rice industry to purchase a large amount of rice and paddy to be shipped out, and daily received hundreds of thousands of shi of japonica paddy and two or three thousand shi of white rice. On the 15th and 16th, the purchasing power was still strong. Coarse japonica was 16 yuan, 3 or 4 corners per shi, and japonica paddy was 13 yuan, 2 corners, and 5 points per shi. White japonica was at 28 yuan. Hoarders purchased one after another. Although the arrival was rushing, the market had rises and no falls, and the rice price rose by more than one yuan compared to a week ago. Japonica paddy rose by 5 or 6 corners per person.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Flour Market Stable <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The flour market situation was peaceful, and the No. 2 flour factory's price was still 13 yuan and 5 corners. Returned goods with old truck brands were also equal to the factory's price. Transactions on this street gradually turned to wait-and-see. Guest sales lacked impetus due to the high prices of guest discs. It was heard that a small number of foreign gun station flour was handled by the northern gang, with the price being 13 yuan, 7 or 8 corners.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat transaction gradually became active. It was heard that Chinese factories still needed to match local wheat because foreign wheat was loaded. The supplier was unable to struggle. It was estimated that more than 5,000 packages of Changxi and other wheat were opened, with the price being 21 yuan to 20 yuan and 8 and a half corners, about half a yuan lower than the previous session. It was heard that Suzhou Gaodu wheat still required 21 yuan and 5 corners, and the incoming households hated the opening.</p>
<p>Wuxi flour, powder, and transport to Shanghai have been shelved for a long time and cannot be moved into the concession. In addition, there is sufficient flour in Wuxi, and the market situation has been trending downstream, falling to about 11 yuan per package. In the past few days, large households have inquired about it, and this month's flour has rebounded by 3 or 4 corners. The market opened at 11 yuan, 3 corners, 7 or 8 points on the 15th, and the May period flour opened at 11 yuan and 5 corners in the early market.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Metals: Metals Rise, Unstoppable <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's metals market was affected by many factors, and the market trend was turbulent and very powerful. The hoarding trend was revived, and the prices of various commodities soared. The market disk changed several times a day. For example, the price of black iron ingots was still 880 yuan in the previous market, and yesterday's market required 900 yuan. The price increased by 20 yuan in one day, which was rare in the past one or two months. Each box of 200 pounds also required 85 or 6 yuan, and general hoarders and speculators scrambled to purchase endlessly, while the actual transactions of various manufacturers and merchants felt as few as morning stars. Other foreign nails opened at 60 yuan, and new lead wire also broke the 100 yuan mark. The price of company iron was about 170 yuan per box, and the price of tinplate was 220 yuan. Single chain also opened at 120 yuan, and American bar iron also hovered around 120 yuan. The asking price for 26-gauge large tinplate was even more amazing, requiring more than 500 yuan per box, which was never seen before.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Piece Goods: Dragon Head Fine Cloth Falls Significantly, All Coarse and Fine Piece Goods Fall, Fellow Traders and New Hoarders Buy In <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw retail hoarders scramble to sell off, and the actual demand was limited. Fellow traders and new households bought in at reduced prices, so the selling price plummeted. The lowest price of Fugui fine cloth reached 42 yuan, and the lowest price of Fugui fine twill was 36 yuan and 7 and a half corners, a decrease of about 5 yuan per piece compared to yesterday's market. Coarse cloth fell by 2 and a half corners to one yuan per piece. Yihe goods were more stable. The transaction volume on this street was suddenly light. Wholesale shops handled more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth twill, and fellow traders traded more than 200 pieces of various goods. The colored cloth industry temporarily suspended the purchase of grey cloth. Cantonese gangs handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth bleached cloth poplin, and Wen Yong gangs from Zhejiang Road handled more than 300 pieces of twill colored cloth coarse cloth. Today (18th) there are 785 pieces of piece goods to be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Piece Goods - East</p>
<p>Rising and falling alternately, the falling wind is always strong. The price of white goods Longtou fine cloth opened at 44 yuan per piece in the morning. Not long after, due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, the asking price was chaotic, and it plummeted to 40 yuan and 05 corners. The shepherd's disk at noon was 41 yuan. The back market stepped down again from the 39 yuan market, and the lowest price was sold at 37 yuan and 5 corners. Immediately after, the falling trend was too severe, and the rebound was also fast, and the closing price was 40 yuan. The market only traded white goods fine cloth throughout the day, and fine twill seemed unheard of, and only the sound of Longtou was heard in fine cloth. The middle-end brands were also rarely traded. This is enough to show that the soaring and falling in the past two days was manipulated by non-industry speculators, disrupting the market.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Yarn and Cotton: Cloth Falls Miserably, Yarn Price Drops Straight Down, Shuangma Falls 75 Yuan At Once <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to fall, and the falling wind was also strong. The one-rise and one-fall in recent times is truly alarming. The soaring in the past and the miserable fall today are all too violent when compared. However, the current yarn sales can still support it, but there must be a big drop if there is such a surge.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, and the market was still in good spirits. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,430 yuan, and the factory list spot was 1,440 yuan. As soon as this price opened, there were few buyers in the market, the food households were not prosperous, and it showed a tired image. It fell to 1,400 yuan for the factory list. The Guangbang purchased spot goods at a price of 1,430 yuan. There was a slight spin in the middle. It was heard that the cloth market was sluggish, and it fell again.

<p>Indian Cotton Sources May Be Hit - Pingguoer Jumps 5 or 6 Yuan</p>
<p>There were fewer local cotton transactions than before, but the people's sentiments were particularly good, so market prices rose daily. The price of Pingguoer rose by another 5 or 6 yuan compared to the previous day. This is because the European war has a pattern of expansion, and the sources of future ships may be hit, so the price of cotton is advancing daily. Those who are Luo are quite enthusiastic about the spot goods. The transaction situation of the current cotton is listed below.</p>
<p>Another news about the foreign cotton market price: the New York cotton market was quite firm and active yesterday. At the same time, it is widely rumored that the government will raise the loan prices for new flowers, so buyers are very prosperous. The back market rose again, and a part of the short covering resulted in a closing price higher than the recent period of the previous day by 5 or 6 pounds and 10 cents, and the long-term rose by more than 10 pounds and 10 cents. India stopped trading yesterday, and it is predicted that it will rise by one rupee. Egypt fell by more than 20 pounds and 10 cents yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions Continued To Be Very Active Yesterday, And The Price Of Cotton Did Not Loosen Due To The Decline In Yarn Prices. The Trade's Appetite For Spot Goods Has Always Been Strong. Because Indian Cotton And Transporting Ships To Shanghai Are Difficult, All Parties Are Active In Brazilian Cotton, But All Are For Ships Loaded In June And July. Although The Selling Price Is More Expensive Than Jiao Indian Cotton, It Is Much Cheaper Than American Cotton. The Following Is Yesterday's Cotton Market Price Calculated At The Exchange Rate Of US$5.9375.</p>

<p>The grey market for securities tended to be stronger yesterday. Initially, it was stabilized by the decline in gold prices, and then it tended to rise due to the saying that Nanchang was recovered. Although there were many buyers in the market, the sellers were also very enthusiastic. Only because the silver roots were tight, the purchase was obviously restricted, which was not easy to arouse the real reason for many people's interest. It is now heard that a certain party is trying its best to disrupt Yu Rong and actively carrying out it. All parties are talking about tigers, and everyone is frightened. This kind of hidden influence has a great influence on the hearts of ordinary people, so the future of the debt market is still full of thorns. Yesterday, Tongkang and Lianhe were the most consistent in buying in, and continued to buy in throughout the morning and afternoon. The rest of Hengkang, Dingkang, Lianyi, Lemao, and Dadu also bought in more and sold less. The sellers were Runli and Zhongxin, and the rest of Yongkang, Tiansheng, Yongxiang, and Hengfu mostly sold more and bought less. As a result, it recovered well by 6 corners to 3 and a half corners. The total number of transactions was about 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 40 shares of Tianchu MSG were traded, the price per share was 89.</p>
<p>The public stock market saw the weekend roll-over by expectation first to sell, and the prices of various stocks returned slightly lower under the pressure of the seller, and the transaction was rare due to the lack of buyers. Jardine Matheson opened, buying at 183 yuan and selling at 84 yuan, with a transaction at both prices. Later, because the buyer was satisfied, the price fell slightly, hovering around 180 yuan for a long time. British joint shares are relatively quiet, opening at 47 yuan, falling to 45 yuan and 75, and closing at 46 yuan with buyers. Jardine Matheson opened, and the auction price fell from 63 yuan to 62 yuan. Due to the relationship of short replenishment, it was pushed to 65 yuan. After that, the selling wind was strong and once lowered to 60 yuan. The closing was firm to 61 yuan. Rubber shares were bleak, and although the price of raw rubber was firm and high, it could not have any influence, because the trend of industrial shares was relatively soft.</p>
<p>The London Securities Market Was Unchanged, And The Industry Guang Company Was Said To Have A Dividend</p>
<p>The British Industry Guang Production Company specializes in land sales and purchases with a capital of 12 million taels and invests in more than 100 real estate properties.

In addition to the special repair reserve of more than 220,000 yuan, the balance has recently been heard that a board meeting will be held within days, and there is a saying to pay dividends.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Coal: White Coal Rises For Four Consecutive Sessions, And Another 10 Yuan Yesterday <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After this default expanded, the price of white coal has already risen for three consecutive sessions. Yesterday, the market was full of rumors that the Norwegian ship was detained, and the freight owner took the opportunity to pick up another 10 yuan. The Dalongxing company, which manages Hongji white coal, has more than 10,000 stones of spot goods in stock, and is still reluctant to sell them, which makes the hearts of the people more and more turbulent. It is estimated that Haifeng white coal is used in the industry line demolition at 190 yuan per ton, and Hongji white coal is 180 yuan per ton. There is a line but no market, and there is no opening for the time being. The white coal shavings for the coal ball raw materials continued to increase by 7 yuan, 115 yuan, and there is no supply yet.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Coal Sources Uninterrupted, Coal Merchants Seize the Opportunity to Hoard <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Recently, seeing the expansion of European affairs, coal merchants in this city have taken the opportunity to raise coal prices, assuming that the supply will be affected. In fact, although Norwegian ships have ceased operations, British and Maersk ships are still sailing as usual, and the supply is not lacking. On the afternoon of the 16th, around 6 PM, two ships arrived in port. They were loaded with large quantities of coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. The Jeannette Shinner, a British ship, carried 3,700 tons and berthed at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading. The Jomislan, another British ship agented, carried 8,083 tons and berthed at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It can be seen that the increase in coal prices is entirely manipulated by coal merchants. ( )</p>
<h3 id="e91">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Stabilize, Coarse Grains Shipped to Hong Kong <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation followed the rising trend of the previous day. Soybeans continued to maintain a price of one yuan, and the trend in the oil market slightly increased. The overall environment loosened, causing operators to hesitate, resulting in a decrease in transactions. However, the market closed with support and did not fall, so people still had bullish sentiment. Yesterday, the unified market only saw the opening of a Nanjing bean car, which was purchased by an oil pressing factory (price details in the market column). Furthermore, local merchants purchased 400 bags of Anqing beans, 600 bags of Wuhu beans, 100 bags of Yangzhou Jue beans, over 100 bags of Qingdao beans, and 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans.</p>
<p>Today, 4,218 bags of soybeans, 1,240 pieces of soybean cakes, 500 bags of raw peanuts, 270 cases and 1,040 cans of raw oil, 40 bags of sesame, and 620 cans of sesame oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>It is heard that an American mail ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, bringing 700-800 barrels of salt from New York. This salt was procured by the British firm Jardine Matheson from America. It is indeed rare to see American salt in China.</p>

<p>(From this newspaper of the 12th year of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Called Another Man Father</p>
<p>Guang Mao Ju is a wine shop located next to the stone gate outside the east gate of Tianjin. Its Wujiapi wine is famous far and wide. Its sales are especially brisk when steamships arrive at the port and sand boats gather. There are dozens of wine vats inside the shop, with bottles and jars stacked high. A certain person from Yangzhuangzi, a village attached to the city, worked at the shop and had a son and a daughter. The son died of smallpox at the age of five, and his body was left in a reed marsh. This happened twenty years ago. One day, a young man in fancy clothes, with a high carriage drawn by four horses, speaking with a southern accent, visited the village. Most of the villagers were peasants, and they suspected there was a mistake when such a distinguished person arrived. But when he spoke the name and address of a certain person, he was exactly right. At that time, the person was working as a fishmonger, had accumulated some savings, and was at the wine shop, but had not yet met the young man. The village elders asked the young man's name, and he said that he was the child who had died of smallpox. The smallpox was caused by congenital heat toxins, and being abandoned in the reed marsh, he absorbed the clear air from the reeds, which dissipated the heat and toxins, allowing him to be reborn. He was picked up by a fishmonger and sold to the Hai Fang Fen Fu Shu (Maritime Defense Sub-Prefecture) in Wei, and the sub-prefect had no son, so he adopted him. Later, he retired and died. Now I have paid taxes and obtained an official position, and I am eager to repay my parents. If I have time, I will visit my father's grave and welcome him to live in the south as an honored elder. The person had a younger brother, who was a laborer living in a nearby village. The young man dressed in official attire visited him, and the uncle saw that his nephew was handsome and had become a high-ranking official, and was extremely envious. He insisted on the young man staying overnight. The person's daughter, because her uncle had traveled far, also returned home to meet him, and told of his journey and whereabouts, and they cried together. The uncle and brother-in-law then urged the father and daughter to reunite. The person did not want to acknowledge the young man, but could not avoid it, so they returned to the village together. Initially, when the person's son lived in his uncle's house, he ate fine meat and wore silk. His traveling bags were brought by his attendants, and the uncle provided his food. After returning home, his meals were the same as before, but the person thought that it could only be temporary and not permanent, so following the local custom, he was given millet. The young man could not swallow it, and said that the poverty in the north was unbearable, and he wanted to welcome the person to return to the south with him.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Spirit of Loving Truth <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xiangfang</p>
<p>"I love my teacher, but I love truth even more." This is the famous saying of the great Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived more than 300 years before the Common Era. Even now, whenever this sentence is mentioned, everyone feels the greatness of Aristotle's spirit of loving truth. Aristotle's philosophical achievements benefited greatly from his teachers and friends, but he felt that what should be maintained even more was the truth of the universe. From this, we can know how humbly he studied and did not hold preconceived notions.</p>
<p>Humility means objectively observing facts and removing prejudices that obscure one's personal feelings. Any fact, any speculation, is only related to the research question. Regardless of whether it conflicts with personal opinions, as long as the evidence is sufficient, it is always accepted with an open mind. If one can do this, the results of the research will be unbiased, accurate, and reliable.</p>
<p>The English philosopher Huxley (T.H. Huxley) once said: "I neither deny nor affirm the immortality of the soul. I cannot produce any reason to believe in it, but I also have no way to deny it... I always need evidence when I believe in something; if it gives me the same evidence, I can also believe in the immortality of the soul." Whether the soul is immortal or not is another question, but Huxley's attitude of breaking preconceived notions is worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>Human thoughts mostly come from experience, and each person's heart is often mixed with emotions such as preferences, dislikes, and hopes. Therefore, when in contact with external things, their recognition and discernment often have errors, but because they are obscured and restrained by personal feelings, or because of the arrogance of reason, they stubbornly hold onto their own opinions without realizing it. Moreover, due to differences in education, habits, occupations, and other physiological and psychological factors, they develop certain quirks and are unwilling to study with an open mind.</p>
<p>With the progress of science and the continuous discovery of new research, so-called truths may have the possibility of change and correction, but in the relationships of all things, there are always facts that possess objective value and are generally recognized by people. We should maintain and pursue these relatively close-to-fact truths with a passionate attitude.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can affirm that truth is the guide of our thought activities and the norm of our daily lives. A person full of the vitality of life must constantly cherish the desire to pursue truth.</p>
<p>If we want to cultivate correct thoughts and reasonable life norms, we must break preconceived notions and avoid blind obedience. For any matter, we must carefully consider and judge it with a strict and objective attitude. Holding the spirit of "examining oneself," respecting the facts before us, being humble, removing preferences, and experiencing the famous saying of that medieval philosopher.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Adult Physical Education <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Shixi</p>
<p>Adult physical education should be universally promoted.</p>
<p>"Physical education" in China seems to be the entertainment of a special class—a small number of students and athletes. Most people, especially working adults, have no opportunity to be involved with it. Therefore, most Chinese people are still "sick men of East Asia."</p>
<p>There are no public sports venues on the isolated island for the public to exercise their bodies. This not only affects individual health but also indirectly affects the future of the entire nation's physique.</p>
<p>On the eve of physical education shining on the whole people, we do not have to expect large-scale group sports venues in the country, like the Soviet Union and other advanced European and American countries, for the whole people to exercise their bodies. However, we should take the simplest exercise methods today to strengthen our physique. Extending it to others and universally promoting it.</p>
<p>Since working adults do not have the opportunity to go to sports venues and gyms of schools or sports organizations to exercise, I think the following simple exercise methods can be adopted:</p>
<p>(1) Deep breathing—Performing deep breathing exercises in the sunshine and in places with fresh air every morning can develop the lungs and prevent the occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis. At the same time, it promotes the health of the body and mind.</p>
<p>(2) Eight Brocades—Is a kind of soft calisthenics. Practicing this exercise every morning or before going to bed allows the bones and muscles of the whole body to move and blood circulation to flow. The physique will definitely become stronger day by day.</p>
<p>(3) Walking—Adults with weak bodies can use walking to exercise their bodies. If one can do more long-distance walking, it can not only strengthen the body but also save transportation costs.</p>
<p>In addition, activities such as rope skipping, jogging, ice skating, visiting parks, and hiking to explore famous scenic spots are all simple ways to exercise. If one can persevere and exercise without interruption every day, one can definitely maintain the health of one's body and mind and increase the pleasure of body and mind.</p>
<p>Universally promoting adult physical education so that everyone has a healthy physique is not only the happiness of individuals and families but also the happiness of the future of the entire nation.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Monkey Assistants <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Mengbiao</p>
<p>In the Singapore Botanic Gardens, there are two monkeys, one named Jinbao and the other named Beide. These two small animals have made considerable contributions to science. The director of the garden, Conner, praised them, saying: "These two monkeys are my very smart assistants."</p>
<p>On tall tropical trees, there are often flowers that are of great value in botany. If people are asked to climb up to collect them, it is not only very difficult but also very dangerous. These two monkeys have been specially trained and can climb to the top of the tree in a few minutes and collect these botanical specimens.</p>
<p>However, monkeys have a bad temper: when they are hungry, they often eat the collected flowers. But as long as they are given some food such as bananas in advance, the same thing will not happen again.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Jesus' Concept of Gratitude (2) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Jesus' gratitude to God for the suffering he was about to endure is completely different from the gratitude of people for material success. Remember that there were ten lepers who came to Jesus for healing. After Jesus healed them, only one of the ten thought it should not be forgotten and returned to thank Jesus. We take many privileges and benefits for granted, with absolutely no sense of reverence; this is our great mistake as human beings. True gratitude is a kind of spiritual power, earned through hard work. This spiritual power can give people moral courage and elevate their minds. A grateful heart can also be said to be a kind of profound thought; those who are thoughtless are mostly ungrateful. We cannot have a sense of gratitude to God out of thin air; we must struggle hard on the battlefield of life and only after achieving victory will we feel grateful. The only way to truly understand the spirit of gratitude is to fight adversity, deal with our own special problems, and give ourselves a reason to be grateful. Two young men wanted to find jobs, but they didn't dare to ask themselves, so they asked their mother to intercede with Jesus on their behalf. Seeing that they had no idea what they were asking for, Jesus frankly asked them, "Can you drink the cup I drink? Can you be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" In other words, can you endure all the hardships and difficulties that I have endured on the battlefield of life? After suffering pain and disappointment, can you still thank God for it? When everything seems to be against you, what assurance do you have as a person? Jesus is asking us the same questions today. Can we be grateful for adversity and for the lessons learned from adversity? (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Plagiarism Rescue <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Han, editor of "Free Talk":</p>
<p>Actually, we cannot blame you for the negligence in editing contributions, precisely because a person's energy is limited and cannot read all the medical books in the world. Moreover, no one in the world can completely remember all the articles they have read.</p>
<p>Didn't you tell the contributors long ago not to steal other people's articles and pretend they are their own works? But in the "Free Talk" of the sixth of this month, I discovered a plagiarist—Shao Xiongfei—who moved a piece of "The Sovereignty of Occupation" (written by Lu Fei Kui of Tongxiang, published by Zhonghua Publishing) to "Free Talk" to deceive readers, passing it off as his own work.</p>
<p>Although his "Disaster Relief through Remuneration" at the end of the article is a kind act of charity, this kind of behavior is as ridiculous as a thief stealing someone else's things as a gift to give away. If, at the moment of giving or receiving this gift, someone points out that it is not a gift but stolen goods, then the giver's face will be flushed with shame, and the recipient will surely feel uncomfortable. This kind of behavior that harms others and does not benefit oneself, even if it is well-intentioned, is not glorious.</p>
<p>I think the victims of the disaster also understand etiquette deeply, and they will definitely not accept Mr. Shao Xiongfei's "righteous act." On the contrary, they should give him a lesson so that he will not insult you again in the future.</p>
<p>Practicing writing articles is originally a good thing. "Disaster relief," in this era of great changes, is a duty that everyone should fulfill, in addition to the victims of the disaster themselves. However, stealing other people's articles and then "disaster relief through remuneration" is a loss greater than the gain to one's personality. I feel sorry for Shao Jun and hope that he will value himself more in the future.</p>
<p>Sir, do you think I am right? Please accept my best wishes.</p>
<p>From reader Zhu Yunting.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Personality On Sale <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yongyun</p>
<p>Respectfully dedicated to plagiarists</p>
<p>Open your eyes and take a look at Shanghai society. The first impression that comes to mind is speculation and opportunism. Once this trend starts, people who shake their pens also plan to find shortcuts to success. But becoming successful by copying books is just a rumor. As for the reality—let's also copy a trendy sentence: "It has never happened."</p>
<p>"Speculating" is the game, "opportunism" is the goal, and the original intention of plagiarism is naturally to fish in troubled waters. But this is exactly what is called being too clever by half. In broad daylight, under the watchful eyes of the public, to think that one will not be exposed is truly "difficult, oh heaven."</p>
<p>Hiding one's name, so no one knows, even if things fail, it seems that there is "nothing to be ashamed of." However, in this year of rising prices for everything, why bother with a sale of one's personality? Shouldn't plagiarists "think thrice" about it? Remember, Buddha said: turn around and the shore is at hand. Then, I, you, he—in the order of readers, "authors," and editors, it is not old-fashioned to say—we are all fortunate.</p>
<p>As the times progress, strange things happen in the world. Now that we have reached a point of "fervor," we even have plagiarism for disaster relief. It seems that they deeply understand the meaning of "even thieves have principles," but I don't intend to say "it is excusable," but rather ask the question: "What is the intention?" At best, one can only say "unfathomable," "unfathomable." I also have to "hold back."</p>
<h3 id="e100">"Philanthropic Plagiarist" <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Regarding this heartbreaking unfortunate incident, after the exposure by Mr. Zhu Yunting and the "Dedication" by Mr. Li Yongyun, the personality of the "philanthropic plagiarist" Shao Xiongfei, who is fit to be with the trash, has been nakedly exposed before hundreds of thousands of readers. There is no need for the editor to say anything more.</p>
<p>I only want to declare here that the remuneration for the article plagiarized by the "philanthropist" should be cancelled in order to express our deep disgust for such incidents, to express our non-cooperation with the "plagiaristic philanthropist," and to let him know that becoming a "philanthropist" has not been achieved, but the loss of one's personality is a thing that is a loss greater than the gain.</p>
<p>We thank our friend Mr. Zhu Yunting of "Free Talk"!</p>

<h3 id="e101">Also on Friendship <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Liu Daohong's "Great Friendship" on March 28th, I seemed to feel an indescribable sense of lightness and joy in my heart, because before that, I had never thought that there were people in the world who sympathized with me and had the same feelings as me. I always thought that my need for friendship, my need for comfort, my need for encouragement, my need for help, was my hysteria, my personal extravagant hope, and not a universal human desire. Therefore, it has become a big secret that I have been hiding for eighteen years.</p>
<p>When a person comes into the world, many difficulties, sorrows, and despairs arise invisibly in his fate and encounters. Therefore, everyone needs various kinds of spiritual comfort and nourishment. Once he cannot get it, he gradually becomes cold, indifferent, and even resentful towards the world. People are originally deformed, and people's hearts are originally contradictory. When you hope to gain the friendship of others, why are you unwilling to first give your own friendship to others? Why not give a little comfort to others and gain even greater comfort from others? People need "great friendship," but why is it lacking in the world? This is always my question.</p>
<p>Know that when someone gives you friendship or also hopes to accept your friendship at the same time, this is your happiness, your right, you should treasure it, accept it. Because a person who destroys his own happiness and rejects the rights he should enjoy is foolish—if you are sure that it is true happiness, true rights. At the same time, it also gives rise to the obligation to increase the happiness and rights of others.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes to have a fulfilling and noble life, but whether or not they can get it depends on the price each person is willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>Innocence and Romance, Each with Their Own Sentiments</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin: People often ask me, "What kind of man do you want to marry in the future?" I tell them that this question reminds me of the girls in the city who used to curse and no longer wanted to marry a farmer—but now they are milking cows!</p>
<p>Mikhail Rasumny: My method of writing a song is to make it fit the score, so I have to study the score first. The score is a hint to the lyrics. If you study it carefully, it is easy to write the lyrics. But after the score is finished, I feel that I can't think of a good name. Perhaps this is the most difficult thing in writing a song.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple: When I was little, I liked to grow up and open a cake shop. Later, I wanted to be an upper-class person—but now I am a little vague about this matter and don't know what to do in the future. I don't like pastries. I can't be a gentleman either; therefore, I imagine that maybe I will be a housewife.</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper: In this film city, money is indeed taken lightly. How could ordinary people have a daughter who can earn ten dollars a week? My father is the same. So I told him that I would work hard in the future, and he allowed me to have fifteen dollars a week for pocket money.</p>
<p>Linda Ware: When I first went to shoot "The Star Maker," I was almost scared to death, and when I first faced the camera, I was almost a fool. Now these are over. I know how I should work. The only hope is to continue to make movies.</p>

<h3 id="e103">"Yue Fei Devotes Himself to the Country" <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>Recommended to Men and Women with Guts</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Yonggang has recently completed the film "Yue Fei Devotes Himself to the Country." The writer has seen the trial screening and briefly describes his impressions as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, I didn't pay attention to this script. I only knew that Xinhua was making a movie about Yue Fei. I privately thought that the stories adopted were the twelve gold medals and the Fengbo Pavilion, etc. What is now extracted is from Yue Fei's entry into school to seizing Xiao Liang Wang. What the director wants the audience to know is not the great achievements of General Yue's battles, but the director tries hard to emphasize the process of Yue Fei's adulthood, how he studied diligently, how he practiced martial arts diligently, and especially how he forged his iron will. This is the most important part, which determines his future heart of sacrificing himself to defend the country.</p>
<p>This story cannot have a romance. It must develop in a tense and serious tone. The director also tries his best to achieve this. He avoids mediocre transitional scenes everywhere, and makes big and small climaxes appear one after another. The so-called climax here does not necessarily refer to lively and stimulating books, but also includes profound dialogues. The aim is to make the audience deeply impressed by Yue's mother's way of teaching her son, Zhou Tong's patient guidance, and Yue Fei's perseverance.</p>
<p>The writer would like to recommend this work to men and women with guts. After you have seen too many love stories, and then take a look at "Yue Fei Devotes Himself to the Country," you will be awestruck, and your mind will be awakened like a spoonful of cold water poured over it.</p>

<p>— Yun Yun</p>
<p>The mysterious lady Greta Garbo, whose face appears on the screen, always has a cold face, as if she has experienced a lot of worldly affairs, and her facial muscles have been stimulated to loosen. She is unwilling to leave a trace of a smile for the world to see. In the past two years, this famous female artist has been separated from fans for a long time. She needs to rest and she needs to be silent. She wants to meet the world in the silver screen with a new attitude.</p>
<p>This time, Garbo's wish has come true. In "Ninotchka," she not only sings and dances, but especially shows a smile, making the whole world laugh with her, laughing heartily. Undoubtedly, this is a brand new page in Garbo's work history. The most famous director genius Ernst Lubitsch is responsible for the whole film. He handles the whole play in a way that is neither detached nor sticky, just right, especially a kind of "Lubitsch touch." Only this Ernst Lubitsch has this kind of humorous style.</p>
<p>We have seen a lot of Garbo's tragedies. Her profound acting skills have aroused resonance in the hearts of many people. In performances like "Ninotchka," Garbo's style has indeed changed. She not only has great achievements in tragedy performances, but also has extraordinary success in comedy performances, which proves that her acting skills are multi-faceted. Without great talent, she would not be able to complete them happily.</p>
<p>The plot is about a Soviet Russian female representative who goes to Paris to sell the precious jewelry of the noble ladies of the old Russian era. As a result, the playboy viscount of Paris falls in love with her. The actor playing the viscount is the famous mustached Melvyn Douglas, whose methods of cherishing the weak and protecting the tender are very skillful, turning the steel heart of this Soviet Russian female representative into a soft silk.</p>
<p>This "Ninotchka" is a rare unprecedented comedy. It is expected that after its release, there will be an amazing sensation!</p>
<p>Sixteen wonderful scenes from the cartoon photo "Pinocchio" have been photographed and shipped to Shanghai. Each photo costs six cents. The Fan Club at Shanghai P.O. Box 2020 sells them.</p>
