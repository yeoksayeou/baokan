<p>先舉一例：法國駐華大使館昨在上海發表聲明、謂一願將法國負責方面的正式吾認，重言申明之；即關於（一）法德進行初步和議，（二）法國領土轉讓，（三）法國以軍略根據地聽由德國或義國借用，（四）法國本國或屬地任何地方主權　削之一切謠傳。均屬向壁虛構，絕無根據一。這一聲明，將使聞者不能不觖望於未將越南主權剝削的事實，坦白的列為例外：但同情於法國的人們，無不祝望這聲明很忠實的與實際相符。所不能無疑的，貝當上將往晤德國元首希特勒，賴伐爾憧憧往來於維希與巴黎之間，希特勒復於其事前後往晤義國首相墨索里尼與西班牙元首弗期哥、最觸的內情諱莫如深，却亦並未諉為禮尚往來；而義國報紙關於此項行動的論述，隱然承認了其間的勾結。然則德法兩國當局所接觸的，誰能置信於其為結束旣往。而非策動方來？法國如在釜俎之上，安能與德抗違；雖法方正式吾認者如彼，然則第動的內容如何？</p>
<p>又一事例：德義日三國盟的第三條、是盟的最活躍最精采的主要條款、規定「德義日三國的定彼此根據上項新方針之努力，並的定三締的國中、有一個受現未參加歐洲戰爭及中日紛爭之國家攻擊時，三國當用一切政治的經濟的及軍事的方法援助之」：據吾們看，現在是義國攻擊希臘而不是希臘攻擊義國，故德日兩國得不因盟的而發生援義的義務；但是義國所發表的文告，却明明指謫希臘幫了英國，所以不得不攻希，故義國得以同樣措辭，耍求德日予以援助。而德日兩方消息則離奇之至：德國方面有調解希義戰事的傳說，似乎義國攻希，是他密切至形影相隨的同盟國德意志所事前並未知道：又似義國攻希的前夕。墨索里尼對希特勒的來臨，雖日歡恰逾恒。却未推誠相與，故發動侵希，亦屬秘而不宣。日本方面對希義戰事。佯作癡聾，似乎惟恐盟的的牽累。我們根據通常的理智，以為決非德日在盟的墨瀋未乾之時，遽爾寒盟；然則三國盟的雖表面上誼同一體，聲勢祗祗、實際上別有密約，抵銷盟的的全部，至少亦抵銷了其中的一部：祗祗者，祗是國際賭局之中的白老虎（Bluff）。當然非同白紙,然則盟紐所切實勾結者究竟是什麽？</p>
<p>又一事例：義大利侵襲希臘了，誰都不能遽信：蘇聯願見西南大門，黑海鎖鑰。淪交義國管理，而坐視希臘敗亡；土爾其願兒歐洲新秩序」漸决形成之日，割棄其歐陸領土，交予德義「領導」，而坐視希臘敗亡；德國願見義大利侵略的戰敗於希臘之手。到現在為止，蘇聯土爾其德意志三國，對於希義戰爭。相率表示其尚居局外：希義戰局決不會久於相持不下，然則蘇土德固將局外到幾時？英國援助希臘，不但明白表示，且海空軍已經發動了，態度可謂十分明朗。蘇聯沒有條件的不置可吾。德國不助義國，以英軍不在希臘登陸為條件。土國不助希臘，以保加利亞不侵希臘為條件。似乎多方相牽制着，而又各譏對方外交策動的失敗。軍事結局固不可知，然事實上究竟何所期待？外交上究竟誰算成功誰算失敗？</p>
<p>綜上各種可　的現象，不容輕率認為各方並沒計劃，並沒把握，祗是徐待事實的發展，僅謀事變的應付！我們則惕然於九年來遠東變局的當初未經有關各國合力制止，以致演為今日世界顛危之局：及至目前，猶不相　戒。習於方式主義的義務與牽制，坐視侵略者實塊其各個擊破之謀，相繼掙札汨沒於其水到渠成之日。抗戰逾三年而不敝者，能有幾國哉！</p>

<p>本報前自九月一日歐職一週年紀念日，譯載「歐戰叢談」以來，忽忽已兩月，其間關於軍事政治民氣乃至軼聞瑣訊，無不兼收並蓄，而未及揭載的尚有多篇。茲者，本報又復絡續搜集着不少豐富的材料，均係出於參與機密或身歷其境之英法美第一流作家手筆，所述盡屬英法政治軍事所以敗壞至此的史實，洋洋灑灑，曝露無遺。編者爰本「前事不忘，後事之師」一義，提前譯錄，定名曰「歐戰痛史」。贖者窺得全豹之後，必可恍然英法當初的不能振作，不外由於舉棋不定，備戰太遲」八個字。其第一篇「英法分裂的始末」係法國著名史家傳記家莫樂AndreMaurois所撰，原文載美國Coll．er＇s週報。至於「歐戰叢談」擱置餘稿，此後仍當賡續發表。</p>
<p>下面是「英法分裂的始末」譯文：</p>
<p>自一九三九年九月歐戰開始以來，德國方面的宣傳，卽以離間英法聯盟為目標。八個月內，法國人每天總是聽到說：法國是被英國牽入戰爭漩渦的；英國人自己不打仗，而且從來沒有打過一回仗；英國人不過供給兵器，法國人却去充當砲灰。他們並向法國方面散佈許多畫片，上面繪着央國兵正在把法國兵推入「血池」，或是畫着英國軍官正在巴黎玩弄半裸體的女人，而法國兵却在馬奇諾防綫日夜守望。迨至一九四〇年六月，德國的宣傳居然大奏功效，不但使英法離異，且使他們化友為敵，其故何在？</p>
<p>第一，法國人成見太深，以致此種宜傳更見有力。遠在德國之前，英國已為法國的世仇，法國人對於此種宿寃，迄今仍念念不忘。我曾在許多省地方縱談英法友誼，每被百年戰爭結下的不解之仇所窘。固然，法國已故外交部長德爾卡賽曾在一九〇四年努力調和兩國，樹立協商關係；固然，美軍在一九一四年至一九一八年間會與法軍駢肩作戰；固然，英國戰士長眠於法國北部地下的有一百萬之衆；但自上次歐戰停止以後，兩國誤會又繼之發生。英國唯恐法國過於强大，因而左袒德國重整軍備，一念之差，終至貽下無窮的後患。</p>
<p>約在一九三〇年，英國駐法大使鐵萊爾勳爵會對我說：「歐戰吿終以來，英國曾鑄成兩大錯誤：：英國人相信法國戰勝之後，已德意志化了，此其一；英國人又相信德國經過若干轉變之後，巳英國化了，此其二。」</p>
<p>一九三六年，德軍撕毀羅後花園中，當然可以暢所欲為，我們為什麽要去管他？」另有一們說：「你們反對我們英國人，不過因為我們不是忠良的法國人而已。」可是事實上並不如此。我當時反對英國人，乃是因為他們不是忠良的英國人。他們並不知道德國重整軍備之後，對英對法，一樣的有軍大威脅呀！</p>
<p>我對於英國民族，深為敬愛，已非一朝一夕。上次歐戰時，我曾駐在英軍中擔任聯絡員。據卡諾公的，重佔萊因區，英國輿論，方沉醉於和平主義，竟拒絕援助法國。</p>
<p>當時英國政界某要人對我說過：「德國人在他們自己的體騐所得，英國對於簽訂的條的，確能信守不渝。一旦國勢危急，該國同別國一樣，也會採用强暴舉動，不過可說決非是出於惡意。</p>
<p>國家猶如個人，其殘暴行為，實是自餒心理所造成。英國並無自餒心理，且適得其反。九百年來，英國國運隆盛，巳養成一種不可動搖的樂觀心理。英國不戰則巳，戰無不勝，因此對於失敗的可能性及其可怕的後果，巳不再想到。自上次歐戰停止之日起，英國人所希望者，無非是歸享田園之樂，以度其習慣的生活；對於武備和戰爭問題，一概充耳不聞。英國教授們所訓誨靑年子弟的，無非是說戰爭是野蠻主義的遺毒，消除不難。可惜他們未曾注意到，公理若不以武力為後盾，邪惡反將佔居上風。</p>
<p>英國還抱有一種錯誤的幻想，就是過於重視國際聯盟，以為教化式的議論可以制服大砲。此種思想錯亂，過於自信，和不顧現實，實必自貽伊戚，早在有識者意料之中。自一九一九年以迄一九三九年，英國始終　在國內綠茵草地，悠然自得，及至幕尼克會議以後，突然醒來，為時已　，最後乃赤手空拳，起而作戰。</p>
<p>這是德國人宜傳成功的第二要素，他們朝夕在法國人耳邊絮聒！「英國並無軍隊作戰，而將使法國戰至一兵一卒呀　」這話。也有幾分可信，英國的海軍固然獨步全球，其空軍亦臻上乘，但在陸地方面，英軍員額及軍備都不充實，在一條漫長的戰綫，祗能扼守短短的一段而巳。</p>
<p>許多法國人都曾以譏諷的口吻問我：「英國兵嗎？英國兵在那裹？法國境內難道眞有英國兵嗎？」</p>
<p>德國的宜傳和法國人的心裹卽使如此，英國若在宜戰之後，卽能急起直追，迅速編成若干師團，法國人的心裹亦未始不能轉趨信任。可是英國人，無論在本質上或主義上，索以迂緩見稱，在這一次戰爭中尤為顯然。工會不肯取消工作時間的限制，直到好幾個月後工會代表羅致入閣之後，這種情形纔見改善。大腹貿則惴惴於國外市塲的不克保持，應向美國及加拿大訂購的貨物，數量不足。飛機製造未收成效，遲至工業巨頭皮孚白魯克助爵出而主持其事，始見轉機。一九四〇年三月，英國專家對於大量製造的坦克車型，仍是各執一詞，相持不下，法國軍備部長陶德禮聞訊之下，曾為之驚異不止。同待法國北路軍用司令皮樂，也向我訴說：「英國人嗎？我知道他們具有優良的品質。他們的兵士確能堅守陣地，他們的將領確甚富於作戰之經騐，只是他們遲緩得不可思議！開戰已八個月了，他們還祇有十師人！單就他們的徵兵額而論，他們至少應編成三十個師了！但是他們做事過於細到，太喜歡吹求。德國人却知道時間的重要。」</p>
<p>英軍中的法國聯絡團參謀主任特卡德上校亦曾憂慮着說：「英國在此後數月內，擬派遣到法國的兵額，我迄無法獲得正確消息。有時候他們吿訴我，在十月以前，可以開出四個師團，有時則說僅有一師。有時候他們準備編成第二軍團，後來又打消了。無論如何，今年夏季沒有多大希望，這是何等苦悶的事。」</p>
<p>但在一九四〇年四月間，德國方面的宜傳還沒有接近他們的目的。法國方面確有許多反英的人，但英法兩國參謀部却推誠相與，較之一九一四年情形有過之無不及。兩國海軍司令部也毫無隔閡；英國海軍部能把所有的新發明，吿訴法國海軍部，法國海軍部也能把一切檔案盡量供英國海軍部參考。（未完）</p>

<p>午後市面、似稍平靜、華商投機家出售美滙、均被外行吸收、價初見硬、計十一月份美匯華商出外行吿六元〇三一二五、及〇六二五、結果供求平衡、收盤巳回至午收價、計英金三便士八七五、美滙六元、下月份與現貨同價、比隔昨英金期現均縮〇三一二五、美匯期貨無榮辱、現貨軟〇三一二五、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、先漲至五千六百元後回跌至五千五百元綫上、午盤因外匯見緊、人心與奮、傾向買　居多、於是盤旋高漲、中以銀號證券　購入最夥、後市外匯平靜、買風消散、而以證券　銀號均爭先吐售、價頗萎疲、雖有出而復進者、但漲力極微、結果五千五百五十三元收盤、惟較上日尚卅十八元、全日交易尚旺、的二千餘兩、銀樓飾金始終不更、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤先漲後挫</p>
<p>最初以外匯稍緊、檯面買戶較多、市氣甚堅、計銀號對做二十兩為五千五百七十元、作開盤價、較上日已升三十五元、嗣於買風中、再漲數十元、計銀號進金號十兩、為五千五百九十元、斯時浮戶稍作了結、略受壓制、計證券幫沽予銀號二十兩為五千五百六十元、但證券幫進金號三十兩、又升至五千五百八十元、惟因錢兌業等吐出、最低會挫落至五千五百五十元、良以銀號證券幫乘賤卽起搜購、由最低拉高達五千六百元、聞外滙亦呈緊狀、計銀號人證券幫十兩、五千六百元是也、迨至收盤、錢兌業金號聯袂賣出、致不能站定、收盤銀號出錢兌業二十兩、為五千六百六十三元、午後初況尚穩、計金銀號對做十兩、為五千五百四十五元、銀號又對做二十兩、回達五千五百六十元、奈末幾證券幫及銀號來市爭售、卒又猛撳、計證券幫出錢兌業　十兩、為五千五百二十五元、後賴銀號反出為入、散戶扒進、始見盤高達五千五百六十元、結果銀號對做十兩、為五千五百五十三元、作晚收價、較是日軋升十八元、全日八十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金終見回平</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價上午十一時掛大十元、午後回低十元、結果勿動、計大同行懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相仿、收　低三十元光景、</p>
<h3 id="c81">美金票好七分 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價、終稍趨漲、故英美金鎊一致微漲五角、英金票仍無人顧問、市價呆定如故、美金票始曾高至十六元一角八分、但入後稍稍回落、晚市退為十五元九角八分、比十日仍漲起七分、香港票漲後稍跌、終比上日尚降二分、日金票漲風已戢、晚市退為一元五角六分、比上日回落三分、朝鮮票需要仍未見減、市價續漲、晚市高至一元二角六分、</p>

<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、再度低落、每千元初貼出為八元、後卽步低至七元、貼進六元、下午再小至五元、貼出六元、比上日再小二元、錢業公會拆息亦猛落二分、早午兩市均為　角云、</p>

<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、自今日（十一月一日）起、改訂各項利率如後、計（公單拆款息）、國幣二角五分、匯劃一角五分、（承兌滙票九十日期貼現率）國幣　角五分、匯劃一角五分、（領用同業滙劃息）、一角三分、（存息除五分）、（同業滙割拆放欠息）、一角五分、（均係每千元每日計算）、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨市又比較疲軟、復趨於盤旋狀況、交易愈見稀少、各幫買賣均甚懈怠、實因連日來鈔票貼水、漸趨消滅、滙劃頭寸愈見稀少、公債向以滙劃為買賣、因頭寸短拙、致交易不能起色、亦一重大原因也、昨日交易鴻大稍有買進、承康始終賣出、聯和先進後出、裕興則仍有出籠、其餘買方為同順恒孚協興沅及永康、賣方為公茂及胡鶴記以及二十五號等、行市先則盤旋、午後略疲、結果略回小二角至六角、成交數的七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>咋日下予收盤後、全體證券同業由聯和號召集在七樓會議、到會人數三十餘家、當經議決自今日起上午買賣仍以滙劃交割、下午起一律改為劃頭、並整明一律以劃頭票據收解、所有客戶存欠並一律以五元貼水率互相貼為劃頭、蓋以日來鈔票貼水日見其小市上滙劃票據漸趨消滅、為推廣業務計、故同業一　贊成此舉、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股一百股、價為七元正、衆業股市行動、似較樂觀、會德豐復處領導地位、晨初開盤即吿上漲至九十元、嗣又續漲至九十二元、但大部份成交價係九十一元、因此項股票之騰達、影響及於各信託公司股價格、俱有進展、餘股亦被多少惠及、橡皮股允其荷印各公司股、趨勢堅挺非凡、蓋良好之中期息、俱已在望也、一般人士略覺昨日市塲購買似感逾量、故逆料今日或有不耐久待之多頭出籠、而使價格比較低廉、</p>

<p>紗市趨勢、飄忽靡常、狂上在下、此因投機籌碼充斥、而多空兩方爭持劇烈、以致人心不一、但實際交易、益覺停頓、不過有一部份「千二百元關口敲破搶進者較衆、同時獲利者抵補、於是雙方並駕前驅、市盤由低轉高、總之就大勢觀測、目前仍在盤檔上進出也、今日有現紗六百三十五件運香港</p>

<p>同行　六·五〇〇　香港　四〇</p>

<p>有詢上七支棉紗市價，查近來市上無成交、因此紗專銷內地、禁止出境、故無行市、至於將二十支紗價換算、照目前行情紊亂、毫無標準、亦難推算、約計比二十支紗低七十元至一百元、然據調查各廠、因成本關係、都不願紡此紗、因二十支利潤較厚也、</p>

<h3 id="c93">美新總領昨發公吿　勸僑民及時撤離　宜乘交通便利束裝歸國　此後難保船隻繼續暢通　傳第一艘撤僑輪明日可抵上海 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>關於遠東局勢、在過去數日中、就表面而論、似已鬆弛、但美國政府高瞻遠矚、認為此種暫行休止之狀態、不能卽視為係局勢業已安定之憑證、故美國除增派輔助艦三十一艘、加入亞洲艦隊、加强實力、作應付緊急事變之準備外、同時並繼續進行遠東美僑之撤退、新任美總領事洛克赫德氏、根據此項政策、於昨晨第一次向本市美僑、發表公吿、請美僑注意最好利用目下所有之運輸便利、菁此種便利、自不能保證其無限期之存在也、洛氏之公吿、特別注重此項勸吿、允適用於婦孺及無留滬必要之男子、洛氏且更進一步宜稱、據來自美國總統郵船公司之報吿、指明定於本月三日離滬之蒙德萊號郵船、尚有不少頭二等艙位可以購得、</p>
<p>傳蒙德萊　明日抵滬</p>
<p>美國政府派至遠東撒退之第一艘蒙德萊號、據郵船公司消息、該船已於前日抵橫濱、當晚八時開滬、預定行程、明日（二日）上午卽可抵滬、執行其任務、惟聞所載第一批撤退之僑民、並不衆多、包括美海軍麥令隊離滬之眷屬在內、大致為三百餘人、據美國方面宣稱、申請撒退已有四千二百人左右、但首批離滬者不多、聞蒙德萊號尚有頭等艙七十個無人問津、此並非美僑擁護政府之不熱烈、實因在上海及各地之美僑、不及結束其在華之業務及家庭、無力者旣無法負担此鉅額資斧、有力者則在滬擁有鉅額資產、多不願卽行離去也、</p>
<p>其他二船　艙位已滿</p>
<p>在十一月第一週中、美國僑民、尚有其他總統郵船二艘可乘、一為庇亞士總統輪、係昨日下午二時四十五分、由小呂宋·香港·來滬、泊浦江中十二·十三號浮筒、卽於今晨離滬赴美、一為柯立志總統輪、現經港開赴小呂宋、於本月五日再駛滬、然後於六日離滬赴美聞兩船艙位、皆已預定一空矣、</p>
<p>華盛頓號　票價調查</p>
<p>據美國郵船公司佈吿、第一艘撤僑船馬列波薩總統號本月十日可抵滬、數日後經秦皇島·神戶·檀香山·而至舊金山、第三艘船華盛頓號七日抵滬、二十一日由上海經馬尼剌·洛杉磯、預定十二月八日可抵加里福尼亞、該船頭等艙票價、與通常郵船票價同、遊歷等艙位、有床位二百九十八、小床四十七、票價床位為美金二百四十元至二百六十元、小床為美金一百九十元至二百十元、歐洲三等艙、包括床位一百四十九、小床十九、票價床位為美金一百五十元、小床一百元、通常郵船、卽庇亞士及柯立志兩輪、艙位均已預定一空、但撒僑各船、則空位甚多</p>
<p>呼籲政府　補助旅費</p>
<p>本埠美僑對於華盛頓方面復電、不允補助遠東美僑撤退旅費一事、深致不滿、因撒僑船隻之艙位、最康票價、為二百五十元至三百元美金、折合華幣每位須四千元至五千元、本埠多數美僑、收入均為法幣、殊難籌此鉅款、每一家長、如有數人之旅費負担、更難應付矣、昨日愛爾考脫氏在無綫電台廣播時、對此曾代表美僑表示不滿、謂美國政府勸告撒退之僑民、着重於無居留必要之婦孺、而婦孺則均手頭無錢、似應予以救濟、本市美僑聯合會及美國商會、對於此項意見、甚屬同情、現正作進一步討論將於一二日聯電華盛頓、請國務院重行考慮、改變其決定、對無力撒退之美僑、能予以相當之援助、</p>
<p>勸吿官佐　遷入防區</p>
<p>美海軍第四聯隊某職員昨日宣稱、關於第四聯隊司今部所發之通吿、囑令寓居於法租界及公共租界其他區之第四聯隊官佐、一律遷入規定之區域內、以便於緊急時期、得隨時召集一節、各官佐方面、一時尚不致有何行動、蓋大多數官佐、巳得主管機關當局之同意、擬待乘載美僑撤退之輪船開出後、再為遷居、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、供職駐滬美總領署巳歷六載之布特烈克、定明日（一日）偕夫人乘批亞士總統號輪離滬赴華盛頓、布氏今日（三十一日）晨晤記者時稱、渠目下並無確實職位、故不願報紙對渠離滬事、大事刊載云、按希氏留滬在美僑與各界間頗負聲譽、五月間、前駐滬美總領事高斯調任美國苜任駐澳公使、布氏卽代總領事職務、至新總領事洛克赫德上週抵滬、始行移交、滬戰爆發後、布氏曾兼充美領署「非正式」發言人、與新聞記者頗有聯絡、至於布氏此行赴華盛頓、將吾調任他職、迄今尚無宣布、惟聞布氏將在美國作短期休假、然後另就新職、</p>

<p>本周出版之密勒士評論報、有外籍經濟評論家阿勒士關於於美國不能放棄上海加以評論云、目前美僑卽將由滬撒退者、僅為婦孺、男子或許永不　滬、而撒退之婦孺、或在不久以後、重返上海、發現其在滬之男子安全無恙、照常營業、或許發生緊急事變、美國商人亦須撒退、但卽在此情形下、亦不能存此幻想、謂美僑永遠撤退、卽彼等不得不離滬、美國將與日本淸算、則美國在上海之商業、必被迫而有短時間之停頓、但不久必將有恢復期間、美國以往不能獲英國之合作、在一九三一至三二年中、反對日本、遂不得不默許日本在滿洲强迫實行「新秩序、」在華北亦復如此、</p>
<p>遠東商業　重心在滬</p>
<p>但日本如認為對上海美國商業强迫實行其「新秩序」而可安全無事、將犯極大錯誤、美國認為上海為遠東商業重心、對於美國商業、極屬重要、在任何條件之下、決不甘受「新秩序」政策而遭犧牲、本年以來、美國與遠東各國之商業、與以往情形、大不相同、南洋與中國有日漸增加之趨勢、而日本則在本年初保持固定狀態、近數月則日漸減少、美國遠東貿易之趨勢、與其遠東政策、有密切之關係、美國貿易、有特殊增進之國家、皆在日本勢力圈外、卽使或有減少趨勢之國家、省在日本强迫實行新經濟秩序地帶、美國務部已有若干决警吿美國商業界、謂美國與日本數年前鉅大數量之商業總滙、乃屬暫時現象、終必趨於衰落、此恰與目前事實相符、</p>
<p>美在華北　商業被擯</p>
<p>美國在中日戰前與日本之貿易、約佔美與中國三倍至四倍之多、在戰爭開始後之最初兩年、日本對美貿易、幾達中國對美貿易五六倍之多、但至今年、日對美貿易、幾不及華對美貿易之兩倍、美國在華北之貿易、幾遭日本排斥盡爭、淮有在上海、美國貨物、仍能輸入中國而不遭日本之干涉、至中國貨物亦不能輸美、而必受日本阻礙、結果在本年過去三季中、祗上海一處佔美國對中國進口百分之七十、與中國對美出口百分之八十、在此種情形之下、美國之不願上海商業受日本「新秩序」而消滅、乃屬毫無疑問之事、</p>
<p>日所宣傳　事實相反</p>
<p>如日本完全控制上海、日本必將以在華北之手段、對付上海、而美國商業、亦將變為日本商業之殘餘部分、美國在華商業、亦將隨上海而俱去、日本過去十年、竭力勸誘美國不反對日本之擴張領土、謂此可以發展經濟姿源、使美國獲得利益、然而事實適足以推翻日本之宣傳、美國除開不能從日本擴張獲得額外商業利益外、日本旗幟飄揚之處、美國商業活動、亦遭禁止、事實證明日本大陸擴張政策、乃為美國遠東商業活動之死敵、蓋美國遠東商業、祗能在日本鐵拳所不到之處興盛也、</p>

<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>南北的地豐路跟東西的愚園路交叉地躺着，東西一條的路中，按放着鐵絲網，前面站着一個富有異國情調的黃衣人，手，怪威武地按着指揮刀的柄。</p>
<p>私人汽車經過，要碰「運氣」，假如高興就一檢查一一下；否則，他撓起了大姆指向後一揮，那你就可以鬆口氣，逃過了「關口」，忐忑的胸口，可以平穩些。</p>
<p>靠南邊，公共汽車，電車，別想有一輛漏得過網，它必須逐一加以檢查，而乘客也必須下車登記。因為每部車子上的趁客登記頗費時間，於是電卓，公共汽車也「囤積」起來了，但這「囤積」不是一奇貨可居」，却變成生意淸淡得「門可羅雀」了。</p>
<p>車子一部多一部，前面在登訊的一部不走，後面一輛就不准向前開，就祗好停在南北馬路的東端，不好過街。因此，這長長的車子的行列可以接到十五六部之多。電車夾着公共汽車，有時從極司非爾路一拐灣就可以看到。據說，起初一雙層車登記時更糟，更慢，現在換了「單層車」，已經好多了。</p>
<p>靠北邊，人的行列可以不經過檢查和登記。於是人們就從北面的人行道上過去。靜安寺路下了「雙層車的趁客，也就不換「單層車」，寗可自己走過地豐路上車，可免去許多麻煩。於是，「外國學堂一的站頭上人頭擠擠了。</p>
<p>可是，裹面出來的車子每輛都載滿了人，但道是去租界的，他們不管。</p>
<p>一排人在登記</p>
<p>在愚園路南邊的人行道上，放着一隻小桌子，有人在管理着登記事宜，旁邊還有着監視者。</p>
<p>「姓甚？名誰？家住何方？作何賣買？來此何為？……」一連串同樣的問話，像出自一只模型似的，而鉛筆也就機械地在紙上爬過。</p>
<p>一個個排着下來，寫完了又一個個排着上去　車子引擎聲響了，後面又跟上來一部。</p>
<p>後面停着的車子着實不少，賣票，開車的確厭得很，就跑出來靠在車箱旁聊聊天兒」</p>
<p>「喂，金福，個兩隻「殼子」嶄來！」一個司機喊着，離在開鐵絲網不遠的地方。</p>
<p>幾個摩登姑娘，手裹拿着厚厚的洋裝書，走過了「對鎖綫一，臉上泛起一陣笑容，趕上去趁車子。</p>
<p>「Bye-Bye！琍琍！」一個娘兒舉着一隻手奔過去了。</p>
<p>後面一輛登記「完了」的車子開了上來！</p>
<p>兩面旗子</p>
<p>過了「封鎖綫」的中間一段，倒「像煞嘸介事」，「平靜如常」，六六八弄就有點兩樣了</p>
<p>說是「出事地點」，不得不如此。</p>
<p>換門挨戶都掛上兩面旗，然是好看，但迎風飄拂，顯得無力非凡。</p>
<p>裏面有人在準備搬家，而且白色廠房的屋頂牆壁都在拆掉，是為了築路。今天是第一天答應搬，但監視還嚴密得很，大概再怕出岔子吧</p>
<p>一個老媽子，手裹挾了一條被絮出來，臉上顯得淸瘦得很，而且黃得可憐，她看了看挨門挨戶的兩面旗子，搖了一搖頭，「唉……」！</p>
<p>走出弄堂朝東了！</p>

<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>霍桑便將李芝範曾出外去，和我從老毛金梅嘴裹發現的兩件事實，連着我們在樓上房間中發見皮鞋的事，用簡短的語句吿訴了倪金壽。他又接着說：「我到這裹時，瞧見荷生還在對面轉角上，松泉却已不見。等我聽得槍聲追出來時，荷生也不見了。我想這兩個人都很得力，一定不會壞事。」</p>
<p>我才知道剛才我到這裹時，大同路轉角上有個黑衣人，分明就是特地派在這裹監守的便衣探員。這個人我雖不認識，大概就是叫做何生。現在想必道荷生已尾隨着趙伯雄去了。事後我才問明白，這便衣偵探的派遣，原是出於霍桑的提議。當上午勘騐完畢出王家時，霍桑叫倪金壽撤退那九十九號警士，同時又悄悄地叫他派兩個密探來，原是有着微妙作用的。</p>
<p>霍桑又向倪金壽說道：「你最好再派兩個人來，這裹，說不定還有具他變化。」</p>
<p>倪金壽點點頭，便回淮屋子裹去打鬣話。我和霍桑仍留在門外。我乘機問道：「霍桑，剛才你在李芝範身上搜得什麽？好像是兩張紙。是不是？」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭：「是的，都是郵局裹的收據：：一張是快信收據，一張是滙款收據。」他說完了便回轉身來向西進行。他的汽車就停在空地的西邊。</p>
<p>當他將汽車門開好以後，倪金壽也已從屋子裹退出來。霍桑向他招招手，我們三個人便一同上車。</p>
<p>倪金壽問道：「我們上那兒去？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「警廳裹去。我要等候何生跟松泉的消息。」</p>
<p>在汽車進行的時候，大家都保守着靜默。因為這案逐步地發展，越轉越高，雖已峯巔在望，卻還隔着一陣薄薄的雲霧，最高峯的面貌依舊瞧小淸楚。並且眞像爬山一般，攀登了十分之九羊腸曲徑，最後一分的努力，實際上也許比以前的更吃苦些。這個感覺我相信我們三個人是同樣有的，所以大家都不言而喻地靜默着。　（一五三）</p>

<p>— 黃雨齋</p>
<p>竊以吾紹七縣同鄉會，剙立迄今，已垂三十年，溯念前賢創業之艱，瞻望未來責任之鉅，吾人生當期世，身臨艱巨，光前裕後，責無旁貸，是以茲屆三十週年之期，本會擬於十一月三日舉行慶祝典禮，固有深義存焉。</p>
<p>集團生活，首車聯絡，唯聯絡斯能團結，能團結則感情益豐；本會擁有會員近萬人，居本市三大同鄉團體之一，實力不可為不厚，然較之其他同鄉團體終遜一籌者，其故安在哉？蓋以吾紹人士，耐勞儉樸，固其特長，而閉關自守，亦未始非病，遇事只知因循苟安，不思改進，誰知凡百事物，均隨時代之巨輪而轉移，今日認為極優之思想與表現，或不適於明日，況值茲世界粉爭社會問題日趨錯綜複雜之際，世事滄桑，變幻莫測，更不能不審察環境，切合實際，力求不淪為時代之落伍者，否則，與現在社會背道而馳，可危孰甚。</p>
<p>雨齋不敏，諸公謬以大會之籌備主任見許，自慚菲溥，力絀心長，且以故鄉烽烟未息，餓殍載途，有何紀念之可言；然忝以旅滬同鄉之一，未敢固辭，愚意此决大會，旣以聯絡為要旨，深望旅滬同鄉，踴躍來臨，並望各會員發表宏論，凡關於本會興革事宜，如屬可行，自當採納，庶幾集思廣益，金石為開，信念之心，油然而生，愛鄉之情，見乎言表，然後根枝並茂，蓓蕾燦然。</p>
<p>再者，本會對於創辦教育，素不後人，故巳設有中小學共計四所，自問尚屬無愧，惟對於鄉友疾病治療設備，尚付闕如，引為遺憾。此决在本會裴雲卿先生倡導之下，決定急亟籌建浙紹醫院，亦為要圖之一，然茲事體大，非三十萬元不為功，雨齋願附驥尾，以促其成，望與吾紹人士共圖之。</p>

<p>— 程志政自洛杉磯寄</p>
<p>不久，我在路旁看見有一個路牌，說由此可以到東方公園去，我沿着指示牌，在山頂上果然有一座中國宮殿式的洋樓；買了門票，由一位招待員領着參觀，原來這座花園的主人，以前在中國和日本經商，後來回美，搜集的東方器物珍寳很多，於是乎花了一百餘萬元，建成一個完全東方式的花園，大抵房屋採中國式園林採日本式，游覽了半小時，我似乎忘記了自己還在好萊塢！</p>
<p>記者在福斯公司攝影塲觀光了一次，裹面的佈景，盈千累萬的放在廣塲上，許多我們在銀幕上看到的大宮殿，大旅館，大沙漠河流，十分之九見假的，最近ForeignCorrespondent片中的大飛機。實際上僅是一個大模型，利用無綫電在空中行駛，放大之後，和眞的無異，記者親眼見到這個小飛機，據說，代價也要美余四千元呢！</p>
<p>大明星的住宅，在此維雷山Beverly　Hills一帶，巨廈連雲，窮奢極侈，電影明星的收入，每星期總在美金二三千元左右，也可算是天之驕子了。如果遊客們要在好萊塢看明星，唯一的辦法是守候在舉行初决獻映典禮的戲院門前，那天記者在好萊塢，可巧Foreign　Correspondent正在那晚獻映，戲院前彩色探海燈向高空閃動不已，夜景愈顯得如火如荼。這晚許多明星，都要被請參加，所以戲院兩旁搭了看台，人已擠得根滿後來的祗得站在馬路上，記者因為時間所限，也無心守候了！</p>
<p>整整的一天，差不多已經把好萊塢全鎮遊完了，晚上在洛杉磯的歸途中，遠望着好萊塢的萬丈光芒，十足顯出影國首都的雄姿。何時再來重遊呢？我在幻想着。</p>
<h3 id="c126">茹富蘭論（下） <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>富蘭好在得過高人傳授，受過嚴厲管束，下過苦工，於是根基之好，遂為常人所不及，因為他的根基好，優點亦因之而產生。譬如演雉尾戲，卽可見其雉尾上之工夫，演靠把戲即可見其靠衣上之工夫；演短打戲卽可見其鑾帶上之工夫；此雖小節，但非有相當根基者決難臻此。還可以說富蘭之唯一佳點在一「美」字上，蓋其身上乾淨俐落，姿式邊式美觀，舉手投足無不好看，足下允見工夫，每見其下塲疾走如風，一絲不亂，足步與鼓點相合，眞令人嘆為觀止。此外富蘭能墨守成規，不失原有典型，亦足可取。餘如嘴裹亦極佳妙，對於崑腔曲子更有深刻之研究。凡武生戲所有之曲子，富關無一不能，尤足一記也。</p>
<p>缺點　武生身材以高大為宜，富蘭身材矮小，此其缺點一也；因身材矮小演靠把戲乃嫌威武不足，演鈎臉戲卽覺氣魄不夠，此缺點二也；目患近視演戲方面不無影響，此缺點三也；嗓音細窄欠寬，此缺點四也。</p>
<p>拿手傑作　今之武生大多宗楊（小樓）尚（和玉）二派，宗楊者必以「連環套」「惡虎村」「長板坡」諸戲為拿手，學尚者其傑作則以「英雄義」「戰滁洲」「四平山」諸戲為傑作。富蘭之拿手傑作，較任何武生為多，且為他人所不擅長者，最負盛名之戲如「戰濮陽」「八大錘」「採花」「夜奔」「蜈蚣嶺」。可稱一時無雙。其餘如「挑滑車」「伐子都」「麒麟閣」以及「羣英會」「臨口會」「奇　會」等小生戲，亦為常人听不及者。</p>
<p>結論　以茹富闌之優點與缺點作一對照，吾人更應認為富蘭為一武生不可多得之人才，蓋其所有之優點，要非一般人所能有。換言之今日之武生，能具如富蘭之優點者，目下實無其人。至於富蘭之缺點，如身材矮小，目息近視，皆係出於天然，並非人力所為，實情有可原，設有人詢我以富蘭與孫毓堃孰優？吾人則可於此　人所演之諸戲中作側面之觀察，富蘭雖不擅演鈎臉戲，但其短打戲靠把戲以及武小生戲，戲路之廣，遠非毓堃所能及。毓堃雖擅演鈎臉戲，更長於演靠把戲，但其不能演武小生戲，更不常演短打戲，由是卽可斷定二人之斤量矣。</p>

<p>—演「觀音得道」以濟餓殍</p>
<p>自越劇風行於滬上，於中得二名角，而同出演於大來劇塲，一卽小生馬樟花，一卽靑衣袁雪芬，兩人雖同為剡溪產，同隸一班，又常同演一劇，然其塵緣各異，享遇不同，亦如其素性也。馬以劇情得寗波飽氏婦歡，遂以厚幣聘其為子媳。袁雪芬雖齒稚於馬伶，年方十九，而澹泊嫻靜，幽雅深致，求之優伶中，允為不可多得之人品；其演劇固描摹深刻，細膩熨貼，時而莊重端肅，時而風流倜儻，寗知其戲畢下，已有兩年。因之凡關於有益世道人心之劇，演來允為神情畢肖，若劉香女，若觀音得道，座必為滿。女界中人見之，每至泣下沾襟，共灑同情之淚，改行為善，遂深慈孝之思者不乏其人。迺者米價昂貴，貧民生計日蹙，街頭巷尾，餓殍載途，某善會人，惻焉心憫，於每月發行平飯，以賙貧窮，受惠者眾，辦理日久，彌柿巨耗須有巨款，袁伶亦會中人，見善舉之不可中輟，募款之不容或緩乃自動發心，演義務戲妝，蛾眉不掃，鉛華不施，長袖沒臂，布袍蔽體，與台上判若兩人矣。夫以身為女伶，又為旦角，行逕如是，人竊疑其不類，而不知袁之父，字松茂，固以教讀為生，家學有自，故得如蓬生麻中，鶴立雞羣也。雪芬幼時喜觀越劇，年十二，遂從師習戲，以其表演周至，唱做兼優，扮相具大家風範，為越中士大夫所揄揚。及游甬游杭，復行遊滬，到處博得好評，蜚聲於時。嘗得名流指示，覷破紅塵，立志長齋修行兩天，以所得資，為辦平飯及冬振之用。爰定於十一月四五兩日日塲借座更新舞台，演觀音得道前後本兩天。是劇為袁伶拿手傑作，凡觀過此劇者有口皆碑。惟以一女伶而能熱心義舉，慷慨樂情於社會救濟事業，允屬難能而可貴。故滬上大居士如聞蘭亭黃涵之關網之馮仰山朱棄塵婦女界如李秋君女士等皆樂為之贊助。當世不乏樂善君于，袁伶此舉，必能得多數人之同情，予以盛大之助力，獲得美滿之結果，可預卜也。</p>

<p>The Guangxi Chinese army crossed the Yong River, pursuing and attacking in multiple routes. At dawn on the 31st, the central route had reached south of Datang, pacifying the affected people along the way, and were currently searching and advancing. (Reported on the 31st)</p>
<p>The Chinese army spokesperson in Cheqing announced today that there were no traces of Japanese troops in the areas of Nanning and Longzhou. The Japanese troops withdrawing from Nanning had boarded transport ships in Qinzhou. The Japanese troops withdrawing from Longzhou had entered Vietnam and were reportedly boarding transport ships in Haiphong. The total number of Japanese troops withdrawing from southern Guangxi was estimated to be two and a half divisions. The Japanese troops currently in Vietnam were between one and two divisions. In addition, there were rumors that Japanese troops from southern Guangxi had been transferred to Hainan Island. When asked whether the Japanese troops withdrawing from southern Guangxi would be used for a southward advance, the spokesperson replied that it was too early to determine the final destination of these Japanese troops. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>A Chongqing Guangxi front-line battle report stated the details of the Chinese army's recapture of Nanning: The vanguard of the Chinese army entered the city at 8 PM on October 29th. The main force, advancing south along the highway from Binyang and Wuming, officially entered Nanning at 3 AM yesterday. They then crossed the You River and continued to advance south, engaging in combat with the Japanese rearguard. The Chinese army advancing eastward from Longzhou had made contact with the Chinese army in Nanning. At the same time, the Chinese army operating east of the highway south of Nanning was currently pressing southwest toward Qinzhou to pursue the retreating Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in Longzhou had retreated to Pingxiang, near the Vietnamese border. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Guangxi Chinese troops yesterday recaptured Longzhou Pass and two other important strongholds. Currently, the Chinese army is fighting the Japanese troops in Pingxiang. (Associated Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>The news of the Chinese army's recapture of Nanning reached here in Liuzhou at 6 AM this morning. Reporters immediately reported to Guizhou and other places via long-distance telephone and used various methods to inform all sectors of the city. For a time, the city's residents ran around spreading the news, filled with unexpected joy. All government agencies, organizations, shops, and households hung flags, and the sound of firecrackers never ceased throughout the day. It is noted that the Japanese troops landed at Qinzhou Bay on November 15th of last year and invaded Nanning on the 24th of the same month. Up to today, they had occupied the city for a total of eleven months and six days. During this period, the Japanese military used a maximum force of four divisions, amounting to 100,000 men. In total, they used a force of five and a half divisions, totaling 140,000 men. Due to the water, soil, and climate, the disease and death rate was 20%. The combat mortality rate was slightly over 33%. In total, the loss of personnel reached 74,000 men. The loss of other materials was countless. (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>The Chongqing Xinhua Daily published an article today stating that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning was to avoid total annihilation. The Japanese side's claim that there was no need for the Japanese garrison in Vietnam to be stationed in Nanning and its vicinity, expressing that the troop withdrawal was voluntary, was ridiculous. The newspaper continued that the Japanese army had withdrawn and would be surrounded on three sides by the Chinese army. The Chinese infantry had advanced along the Nanning-Binyang highway and the Nanning-Wuming highway. If the Japanese army did not withdraw, it would become "rats in a bag." It also stated that the Japanese army's withdrawal was not surprising. It was only because their strength was insufficient that they had to take this action. Otherwise, the Japanese army would never lightly abandon its war gains, so how could they abandon an important city like Nanning? The *Shishi Xinbao* stated that after Japan joined the Tripartite Pact, it had already become a tool of Hitler. However, the Japanese ambassador could not get rid of the ties in China. It was truly powerless to please its new master and was therefore eager to seek peace with China. In short, the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning and its peace offensive all showed the rapid weakening of Japan's power. (Associated Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Nanning is an important town on China's southwestern border. Its recapture has great significance. According to a military strategist, the reason for the Japanese defeat can be seen from the following factors: (1) Military factors: In recent months, the Chinese army has adopted ambush warfare and attrition warfare against the Japanese army, causing daily casualties and depletion. (2) Material factors: Due to the tight material blockade by the Chinese side and the barrenness of the southern Guangxi land, the Japanese could not obtain local supplies for their military food. Even the slightest bit of grain or wood had to come from overseas. If this was insufficient, starvation would follow. The above two factors were man-made and external. Other natural and internal factors, such as the complex terrain, the special climate, the shortage of Japanese troops, and the demoralization of morale, were also sufficient to promote the Japanese army's defeat. In short, the Japanese army's decision to withdraw from Nanning was out of necessity. In other words, it was driven away by the Chinese army and was by no means voluntary. (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>A Chinese military spokesperson in Chongqing announced today that the Chinese army captured several hundred people from the Japanese army when it withdrew from Nanning. One Japanese division had landed on Hainan Island via Qinzhou-Haiphong. It was said that the Japanese army abandoned Nanning entirely due to Chinese pressure. When the Japanese army entered Vietnam, the Japanese garrison in Nanning was reduced and could no longer resist the Chinese army's advance. Before attacking Nanning, the Chinese army had captured Mingjiang and Suilu on the Nanning-Longzhou highway, cutting off the Japanese army's retreat. At the same time, the central column pressed forward from Wuming and Binyang, reaching only about ten kilometers from Nanning on October 28. (Associated Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>Shangrao: Since the beginning of this month, fierce battles have taken place in southern Anhui, eastern Jiangxi, eastern Zhejiang, and western Zhejiang on the eastern front. The Japanese army, using mobile warfare, launched a large-scale offensive in an attempt to destroy the Chinese military bases. The Japanese first attacked southern Anhui on the 4th, but their main force was surrounded northeast of Jing County, and the Japanese offensive was immediately thwarted. The Japanese army then attacked western Zhejiang and harassed Guangde and Liyang on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, but were also defeated by the Chinese army one by one. On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese army crossed the Fuchun River again and attacked Zhuji. Subsequently, the Japanese army in Xiaoshan also attacked Shaoxing from the east. The Chinese army then grasped the initiative and fought, inflicting blows on the Japanese army. It successively captured Zhuji and Shaoxing, and the remnants of the Japanese army retreated to Xiaoshan. So far, southern Anhui has recovered its situation four days ago. The Chinese army has also captured the Ma Dang Fortress, posing a major threat to the Japanese army. According to Japanese documents captured by the Chinese army, it is known that this was the "October Offensive," with the eastern front as the main battlefield. After a month of fighting, the Chinese army has completely crushed the Japanese "October Offensive." (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Confusing International Situation <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The complicated and contradictory international news is pouring in, making the recent situation seem even more confusing and uncertain. Is this a period of incubation, a state of chaos due to the indecision of various parties? Or is it a deliberately created smokescreen to cover up actions before a major offensive? We should not make any hasty judgment, but we must observe carefully!</p>
<p>Let us begin with an example: the French Embassy in China issued a statement in Shanghai yesterday, stating that it wished to formally acknowledge on behalf of the French authorities and reiterate that all rumors regarding (1) preliminary peace talks between France and Germany, (2) the transfer of French territory, (3) France allowing Germany or Italy to use military bases, and (4) any encroachment on the sovereignty of France or its territories are pure fabrications and have no basis whatsoever. This statement will inevitably disappoint those who had hoped that the fact of the encroachment on the sovereignty of Vietnam would be openly listed as an exception. However, those who sympathize with France cannot but hope that this statement is truly consistent with reality. What we cannot help but doubt is that General Pétain met with German Führer Hitler, and Laval traveled back and forth between Vichy and Paris. Hitler then met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Spanish Head of State Franco before and after these events. The most sensitive inside information is kept strictly confidential, yet it is not dismissed as merely reciprocal courtesy. Moreover, the Italian newspapers' discussions of this action tacitly acknowledge the collusion between them. In that case, who can believe that what the authorities of Germany and France have touched upon is to put the past behind them, rather than to plan for the future? If France is like meat on a cutting board, how can it resist Germany? Even if France's official recognition is as such, what is the actual content of the maneuver?</p>
<p>Another example: Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan is the most active, brilliant, and important provision of the alliance, stipulating that "Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to cooperate in their efforts in accordance with the above-mentioned new policies, and agree that when one of the three signatory countries is attacked by a country that is not currently participating in the European War or the Sino-Japanese War, the three countries shall provide assistance by all political, economic, and military means." In our view, it is Italy that is attacking Greece, not Greece that is attacking Italy. Therefore, Germany and Japan are not obligated to assist Italy under the alliance. However, the proclamations issued by Italy clearly point out that Greece has been helping Britain, so it has no choice but to attack Greece. Therefore, Italy can use the same wording to request assistance from Germany and Japan. However, news from Germany and Japan is extremely bizarre: there are rumors from the German side of mediating the Greco-Italian war, as if Germany, its closest ally, was not aware of Italy's attack on Greece beforehand; and it seems that on the eve of Italy's attack on Greece, Mussolini, despite his unusually warm welcome to Hitler's arrival, did not share his true intentions, so the launch of the invasion of Greece was kept secret. The Japanese side pretends to be deaf and dumb to the Greco-Italian war, as if afraid of being implicated by the alliance. Based on common sense, we believe that Germany and Japan would not immediately turn their backs on the alliance before the ink on the Tripartite Pact was even dry. Therefore, although the Tripartite Pact seems to be a unified entity on the surface, in reality there are secret agreements to cancel out the entire or at least part of the alliance. What is apparent is merely a white tiger (bluff) in an international gambling game. Of course, it is not the same as a blank piece of paper, so what exactly is the alliance tangibly colluding on?</p>
<p>Another example: Italy has invaded Greece, and no one can readily believe that the Soviet Union would allow its southwestern gateway, the key to the Black Sea, to be administered by Italy, and stand idly by as Greece is defeated. Turkey would willingly relinquish its European territories to Germany and Italy for "leadership" on the day the "new European order" is gradually formed, and stand idly by as Greece is defeated. Germany would like to see Italy's aggression defeated by Greece. So far, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Germany have all expressed their neutrality in the Greco-Italian war. The Greco-Italian war will certainly not remain deadlocked for long, but for how long will the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Germany remain neutral? Britain's assistance to Greece is not only clearly expressed, but the navy and air force have already been activated, and its attitude can be described as very clear. The Soviet Union makes no affirmative statements without conditions. Germany will not assist Italy on the condition that British troops do not land in Greece. Turkey will not assist Greece on the condition that Bulgaria does not invade Greece. It seems that various parties are checking and balancing each other, while criticizing the other side for the failure of their diplomatic maneuvers. The military outcome is certainly unknowable, but what is actually expected in reality? Who is successful and who is a failure in diplomacy?</p>
<p>Summarizing the various tangible phenomena, it is reckless to believe that the various parties have no plans, no confidence, but are merely awaiting the development of events and only seeking to respond to changes! We are alarmed that the Far Eastern crisis nine years ago was not jointly prevented by the relevant countries, leading to the world crisis of today. Even now, they do not warn each other and are accustomed to formalistic obligations and constraints, standing idly by as the aggressors accomplish their strategy of defeating them one by one, struggling and sinking into the inevitable outcome. How many countries can withstand more than three years of war without being exhausted?</p>

<p>A Reuter dispatch from Salonika, based on the latest news received here, states that the Greek front line in the Masdunia region of the Albanian border remains firmly entrenched. However, some forward outposts have been withdrawn. Italian Alpine troops are currently operating in the area, but apart from bombarding the Greek front line to ascertain its exact position, no large-scale actions have been undertaken. The Greek frontline commander has issued orders that all positions must be maintained at all costs. It is reported that an Italian unit was ambushed by a machine gun nest and suffered heavy losses. The Greek commander seized the opportunity to pursue the enemy into Albanian territory. Currently, ten captured Italian soldiers have arrived here. Over the past three days, Salonika has implemented a blackout, and anti-aircraft positions have been prepared, but no Italian aircraft have been seen attacking. Five hundred Italian residents have been detained, but German residents have not been interfered with. All types of vehicles have been requisitioned, except for trolley cars, which continue to operate. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>According to a general headquarters communique broadcast from Rome, the momentum of the Italian offensive in Greece has slowed down. It is claimed that the Italian army in Epirus has reached the Kiljes River in various locations. However, due to adverse weather conditions and obstacles created by the retreating enemy forces, the Italian army's advance has been delayed. (Reuter, 31st)</p>
<p>Greek forces in Jia Ge Wei Jia, on the Yugoslav border, fiercely resisted the Italian army advancing along the Greek-Albanian front line yesterday and launched counterattacks. It is reported that the Italian army occupied several villages and towns near the front lines, but at a heavy price. Fifteen Italian aircraft, in three groups, bombed Corinth yesterday afternoon, but only one building was damaged. When Fascist troops advanced towards Piresnica, a strategic point at the junction of the Greek and Albanian fronts, 42 Italian soldiers were killed and 60 were wounded. In the same battle, 23 Greek soldiers died and 40 were wounded. Other reports indicate that after two hours of bloody fighting on Tuesday, the Italian army occupied the Greek town of Platania. Seven Greek soldiers died and twenty were wounded in this battle. The Italian army's casualties were much heavier. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>An Athens general headquarters communique states that on Wednesday, the Greek army on the Epirus front slightly retreated according to a pre-arranged plan, and then maintained its position without wavering. Greek artillery fire has hampered the Italian army's activities. The Italian air force indiscriminately bombed Patras, machine-gunned civilians, and destroyed several houses. Several undefended cities with no military significance were also bombed. A Greek aircraft that engaged enemy fighters in Albanian territory has not yet returned. (Reuter, 31st)</p>
<p>Naval battles between Greece and Italy have continued since the early morning of Tuesday. It is reported that Italy is adding to its forces in an attempt to make a central breakthrough towards the vital rail junction and Italy's direct target, Florina. It is widely believed that Italian aircraft will launch a lightning attack on Florina, and then strike the major city of Salonika on the Greek east coast as an additional target. While Greek troops in the mountains are repelling 10th-century Italian weaponry, and Greek guerrillas are impeding the Italian vanguard, Greek general staff personnel claim that due to heavy rains in the mountains in recent months, Italian armored vehicles and tanks have been unable to operate. However, the Italian army is using artillery to heavily bombard the area across Lake Prespa. The Greek high command acknowledges that some troops in this area have retreated to the newly built Metaxas Line. (International News Service, 31st)</p>
<p>The Greek government in Athens issued an official communique last night, stating that the dissemination of false information will be regarded as a hostile act endangering the nation and will be punished accordingly. According to Greek war reports, Greek forces had minor skirmishes with Italian forces in various locations on the evening of the 29th. The Italian army launched a large-scale offensive in Epirus on the 28th, supported by artillery. Greek military operations are proceeding step by step according to plan.

<p>According to neutral military sources in Athens, two Italian regiments launched heavy artillery and air strikes yesterday, advancing in a pincer formation in the northwestern area of the Greek-Albanian border, and occupied the strategically important town of Ioannina. It is reported that Greek forces fought fiercely to resist, and the fighting was exceptionally intense, with heavy casualties on both sides. (International News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>News from the border war zone near the Southern Capital today states that elite Italian troops have crossed the rugged Greek-Albanian border and advanced 30 miles towards the key Greek point of Salonika. It is reported that the Italian army inflicted heavy casualties on the Greek mountain defense forces with intense artillery fire and low-flying air strikes before achieving this victory. It is also reported that the Italian army occupied Breshnica for a day and a half, which is the gateway to the road to Salonika. (International News Service, 31st) According to a Washington dispatch from Salonika in this morning's "Vileum Report" in the Southern Capital, Italian troops have now reached St. Nikolas, 56 kilometers from the Greek-Albanian border. Another report from the city of Dragost states that the sounds of Italian aircraft and artillery fire could be heard all day yesterday. The Yugoslav-Albanian border remains open, with vehicles passing freely, but the Yugoslav-Greek border has been closed. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>An air raid warning was issued here in Athens at 4:20 p.m. yesterday, lasting for half an hour before ending. No artillery fire was heard. The public took refuge in air raid shelters more quickly than before, aware that many residents in Patras were injured or killed during an air raid because they gathered in the streets to watch. According to official sources, 200 people were killed and 280 were injured in the bombing of Patras. (Reuter, 31st)</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, Greece had four army corps, including thirteen infantry divisions and one cavalry division. The Greek army is particularly well-suited for mountain warfare. The Greek air force has 300 aircraft. The organization of the Greek army has recently been improved, and it is equipped with new weapons. Its senior generals are heavily influenced by French military strategy. Its basic principle is defense. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>

<p>Reports from Athens state that under the cover of three light bombers, the Greek army has seized several Italian border outposts in Albania in a surprising large-scale counteroffensive. Although the Italian general offensive on the Albanian border seems to have been thwarted, Italian bombers are flying back and forth over Greece to carry out attacks. The port of Patras was bombed five times yesterday. Battlefield news states that there was a surprising assault on a northwestern, irregular line between Florina and Ioannina yesterday. However, it is reported that Italian reinforcements are approaching the main Greek defense line in a certain location in the extreme west. The Greek high command is moving the main force of 400,000 troops to that location to address this threat. (International News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, three Greek bombers used machine guns to strafe low-flying Italian troops who were assisting in the offensive in the western sector of the northern battlefield, dispersing the Italian troops. All three Greek aircraft returned to their original positions, but one aircraft was hit by gunfire, and one pilot was seriously injured. According to news from here, although the Italian army is numerous, most of them are stationed on the front lines of the Greek border. Patras was bombed five times again yesterday, but only one person was injured because most of the residents had evacuated to other places after the air raid on Sunday. It is known here that Britain is currently trying to fulfill its promise of financial assistance. (Reuter, 31st)</p>

<p>According to authoritative British sources in the Swedish capital, regarding the situation in Greece, the Italian army is currently attacking on two fronts. One Italian army is advancing from Kakavia with Volos on the Aegean Sea as its final destination, and the other army is advancing from Korçë, aiming for Salonika. It is reported that fierce fighting took place between Greek and Italian forces in Florina yesterday. Patras was bombed five times yesterday, with many casualties. An alert was issued in Athens for thirty minutes yesterday, but details are not known. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Italian Army General Headquarters in Rome declared that the Italian army had crossed the Albanian border and advanced more than 50 miles into Greece. According to the communique, the Italian army is advancing steadily on all fronts despite strong resistance from Greek mountain troops. At the same time, the official war report states that three large Italian armies on the central front have already occupied Florina, the "Northern Fortress" of Greece, and their vanguard has advanced eastwards along the main road, heading towards Salonika. Florina is an important rail junction. Unofficial sources here acknowledge that Greek forces put up a fierce fight to defend the city. Salonika, a large city on the eastern coast, is also the destination of the Italian army's subsequent southeastward advance. The communique states that Italian forces are gradually increasing in strength and intensifying their attack, so Greek forces are unable to withstand the pressure and are currently fighting a rearguard action to allow sufficient time to consolidate their main defense line between Konitsa and Salonika.

<p>The Admiralty in London announced yesterday that mines laid by the British Navy have blocked both ends of the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth in the Aegean Sea. Naval authorities stated that a protective net has been spread across the Isthmus of Corinth, the only land bridge between the Peloponnese and northern Greece. The isthmus and the Corinth Canal are extremely important to Greece, so Italy may launch a surprise landing or bombard the area from the sea. The islands of Corfu are not included in this protective net because, apart from serving as naval bases, they are not important. News of British air raids on the Dodecanese area was received here last night. It is reported that the Italian airfield at Maritsa was bombed three times. The news states that the transportation station, hangars, and more than a dozen aircraft were destroyed. It is also reported that the Italian airfield at Gadurra was bombed twice, and the oil depot at the Liberta airfield was burned down. In a statement last night, naval authorities stated that the Italian Navy attempted to damage ships in the Port of Rhodes but was unsuccessful. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>An article by a famous wartime writer, "Pless," in the London Daily Mail, argues that Britain should occupy all important Greek islands and turn them into launching points in the Aegean Sea.

British commentators also argue that the British navy and air force should seize this opportunity and adopt a swift offensive with the "spirit of the Battle of Narsus."

<p>Rome: According to a foreign affairs correspondent from the Italian Stefani News Agency, the results of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Florence will become a complete agreement on future German and Italian political action. The main points are as follows: (1) The war against England will continue until victory, so that Europe can be freed from England's intolerable domination. (2) The Axis powers will reorganize European life through gradual methods and eliminate the chaos created by the Treaty of Versailles. This new order will be realized after England's influence on the European continent is completely eliminated. (3) Germany and Italy have reached a consensus on all aspects of opinion, regarding both European and non-European issues. Hitler's recent talks in Western Europe are part of this cooperation. (4) If France can cooperate in building Europe and change its attitude towards the Axis powers, its situation can also be improved. (5) In the past, Greece allowed the Central Powers to use it to fight against the Axis powers, and at the same time, it used its neutral position to reap the benefits. Today, Greece must know that anyone who helps England is the enemy of the Axis powers. (Reuter, 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e28">German-Italian Diplomatic Activities Have Not Yet Reached Conclusion <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the talks between Head of State Hitler and Marshal Pétain, General Franco, and Mussolini, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that German-Italian diplomatic activities are not yet complete. The military actions of the Axis powers have not weakened anywhere, and their diplomatic offensive will be carried out with the utmost determination in their foreign political war. Regarding the talks between Hitler and Marshal Pétain, it has been learned here that no formal agreement or formal solution has been reached. The discussion only focused on the main issues of France's future position in Europe. The basis of this discussion is that France, having initiated the war and then been defeated, should naturally pay the price of the war. The responsible authorities in France have now also recognized this fact, knowing that France collapsed due to the policies it adopted in the past. Berlin officials know that this point is most important and should be understood by both sides, and it is a prerequisite for the future development of political events. Only in this way can it be beneficial to the future of Europe. When asked about the mission of Spanish Army Minister General Davila to Africa, the German spokesman said that Berlin has not received any notification about this matter, but there is no doubt that the African trip of the Army Minister must be to implement the spirit of the talks between Hitler and Franco. When a reporter asked about the impact of the Italian-Greek war on the neighboring countries, the spokesman said that Berlin has not received any information that proves that any disputes have occurred outside of Greece.

<p>London: General Pétain personally delivered a speech last night from the Lyon Radio Station about his meeting with Hitler, saying that he went to the meeting of his own accord and entered the path of cooperation freely, without any pressure. The French people have the dignity to face their difficulties and the great effort to revive their country, which made this meeting possible. I accept the principle of cooperation between the two countries, and the implementation methods will be discussed later. I believe that the first responsibility of the French people is to trust that in the near future, the suffering of our country can be reduced, the situation of our prisoners can be improved, the burden of our occupied forces' food and supplies can be reduced, the borders can be more fixed, and the government can facilitate the adjustment of local people's food. This kind of cooperation must be sincere and free of aggressive ideas. France has various obligations to the victor, but it still maintains its sovereignty. The cabinet members are responsible to me alone. I spoke to the public as an elder before, but today, I announce to the public as a leader. I hope that the people of the country will listen to my words. (Reuter, 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Hitler Conducts Appeasement Work on Germany and Italy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Sulek: From the news coming from Berlin and Rome, recent developments have forced Hitler to become an "appeaser." However, it remains doubtful whether Hitler's "appeasement" method will have better results than last year's appeasement. Hitler first tried to persuade Italy to sacrifice its territorial claims to France, but this attempt was quickly abandoned, and Italy opposed giving France any positive or negative assistance in the war, because Mussolini was deeply afraid that if France received this assistance, it would be able to be on an equal footing with Italy in Germany's "new order." Hitler then hastily went to Florence, Italy, and the German newspapers published comforting comments to Italy, such as the Berlin Stock Exchange Daily stating that although Germany allowed France to participate in the Axis system after severing ties with England, Germany has not made any promises regarding future peace. The Italian newspapers finally felt relieved at this point. From this, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Germany's new proposal to France is more generous than the original proposal. (2) The temporary peaceful measures will be modified in the future to satisfy Italy's wishes. France has no guarantee of this. (3) The position of French negotiations depends on England's resistance, so the implementation methods of the Franco-German agreement may not be as smooth as originally expected when the details are discussed in the future. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>London: A Berlin dispatch from the Italian official news agency reflects Italy's concern about Hitler's attempts to conclude a deal with the Vichy government. The dispatch stated that Italy has effectively opposed any Franco-German compromise that would sacrifice the results of Italy's victory in exchange for French anti-British action, and it said that according to responsible German sources, the talks between Hitler and Pétain, Laval, not only did not establish a formal agreement, nor did it discuss special issues, what was discussed was only the general plan for France to work on after the Axis countries win. The dispatch also stated that the new European domination must take into account that France, which initiated the war, ultimately failed, so France must pay the full price. On this point, it is not possible to discuss with those who are currently in charge of French policy. (Reuter, 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e32">America Will Use Over 20,000 Aircraft to Assist Britain: Roosevelt Announces Completion of All Procedures in Boston Speech <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Boston – President Roosevelt delivered a speech here last night, announcing that he has completed all procedures to transport another batch of 26,000 military aircraft to Britain. The President stated, "Our nation's factories possess such great productivity that it will make our country the strongest air power in the world." President Roosevelt also announced that he has approved providing Britain with all necessary military supplies, such as allowing Britain to order cannons, machine guns, rifles, tanks, and other munitions from the United States. He also defended the U.S. rearmament program and declared that American youth would not be sent to participate in the European war. President Roosevelt, when discussing the matter of aiding Britain with aircraft, stated that a large production volume is of great importance in maintaining air power. He said that after three months of the aerial blitz, the British Royal Air Force is now even stronger than when the war broke out. He attributed the success of the British Air Force to American assistance. The President, when discussing the satisfactory gains of the U.S. rearmament program, stated, "Within seven years, we will have increased the number of ships in the U.S. Navy from 198 to 337, with another 119 under construction. Since the invasion of Poland, we have more than doubled our country's army. Combining the National Guard that has already been mobilized, the number of men currently in service has reached 436,000. The National Defense Committee is now completing all preparations at an extraordinary rate. Military manufacturing contracts related to national defense that have been signed are valued at a total of 30 billion U.S. dollars." The President finally added that some people criticize the government for not being able to provide adequate accommodation for all the enlisted men, stating that this is inconsistent with the facts and should not be said by a patriotic citizen. He also explained that by January 5th of next year, facilities sufficient to accommodate 930,000 soldiers will be completed. (United Press report, 31st)</p>
<p>Boston – President Roosevelt broadcasted today, stating that the United States has increased aircraft engine production by 2.4% in the past October. We are determined to reach an annual production of 50,000 aircraft and are rapidly advancing towards this goal. The Boeing factory now produces four times more than a year ago, while the Curtiss factory has increased production twelvefold. Since taking office, the current government has been committed to building a large navy. The number of workers in naval shipyards is now six times greater than in 1933, and the effectiveness of naval bases has also been greatly expanded. Since the invasion of Poland, we have increased the standing army by more than double. In the three months since Germany began its blitz strategy, the British Air Force is stronger than at the start of the war, partly due to American supplies. The most glorious fact in the world today is that democracy exists unscathed and is growing stronger. (Reuters report, 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Military Situation in the Mediterranean: 70 German Divisions Concentrated, Hungary and Bulgaria Under Pressure <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London – Reuters military correspondent reports that the opposing forces in the Mediterranean theater are widely dispersed, creating a confusing and unpredictable situation. When Italy declared war, it was expected that they would immediately attack from the Albanian border in coordination with the actions of Italian forces in North Africa, overwhelming the British Navy. However, while the Italian forces in Libya and Albania have undoubtedly made preparations, large-scale battles on both fronts have not yet materialized. According to reports from Libya, the Italian side is busy building roads in Sidi Barrani, but there are no signs of an impending offensive on land or in the air. According to reports from Albania, Italy's best opportunity would have been to launch an attack immediately before Greece could fully mobilize. However, a large army advancing deep into Salonika would have a long supply line and, surrounded by anti-Italian Albanians, would risk being attacked from the rear. Perhaps this is why they have not dared to take the risk of a hasty advance. What is truly difficult to understand is the appearance of 70 German divisions near the Balkan Peninsula. Many divisions are concentrated on the borders of Hungary and Bulgaria, while mechanized units are stationed in towns along the border of German-held Carinthia. These 70 divisions number at least one million troops. What is Germany trying to achieve by assembling such a massive force? The number of German troops in Romania is quite small, so Turkey is not Germany's immediate target, at least for now. The situation in Bulgaria is different because Germany's military actions everywhere exert pressure on Bulgaria, and the Bulgaria army is in a difficult position. Hungary and Bulgaria are even more easily drawn in. It is expected that these two countries will obey Germany's orders. Now that relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are improving daily, the question arises: Does the Soviet Union have any concerns about Germany's intentions? Geography will be an important factor in the development of the Balkans. Hungary is flat, while Bulgaria is mountainous. If Italy wants to attack Greece, it can only advance eastward towards Salonika or southward towards the Gulf of Corinth. Salonika is bound to become a major objective because it is one of Bulgaria's most important trade outlets and has significant military value. However, regardless of Italy's actions, these 70 German divisions cannot be ignored because they can advance through Hungary and Romania towards Bulgaria or drive from Ukraine into southern Soviet Union to seize its oil. Although none of these speculations show signs of materializing, they are all possibilities. Finally, the climate is also an important factor. The mountains in Greece are covered in deep snow, and other parts of the Balkans are cold and damp. Germany may now consider repeating its victory in the invasion of Norway, but it is more likely that Germany will wait until next spring due to the unfavorable weather conditions.

<p>Moscow – The Soviet Army newspaper Red Star today commented on the military aspects of the Italian-Greek war, believing that the war may be protracted. The newspaper stated, "Greece's position in the eastern Mediterranean is very close to the British fleet, and it will certainly receive a large amount of British aid because Britain must try to defend this favorable base." The article continued, "British supplies will be transported through Piraeus, Volos, and Salonika, forcing Italy to maintain neutrality at its base in the Dodecanese. The lack of a base in Albania will hinder the reinforcement of large Italian forces. As long as the British Air Force is within Greek territory, it will threaten the Italian air bases in the southeast. Under these circumstances, the battles on the Albanian-Greek front will not be easily resolved in the short term."

<h3 id="e36">The Beginning and End of the Franco-British Split <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since this newspaper began translating and publishing "European War Miscellany" on the anniversary of the start of the European war on September 1st, two months have passed in a flash. During this time, everything related to military affairs, politics, public sentiment, and even anecdotes and trivial news has been included, but there are still many articles that have not been published. Now, this newspaper has continuously collected many rich materials, all written by first-class British, French, and American writers who participated in confidential matters or experienced the events firsthand. What is described is entirely the historical truth of why British and French politics and military affairs deteriorated to this point, and it is revealed in great detail. The editor, based on the idea of "learning from the past to guide the future," is translating and recording in advance, naming it "A Painful History of the European War." After readers get a complete picture, they will surely realize that the inability of Britain and France to rally in the beginning was simply due to indecision and too late preparation. The first article, "The Beginning and End of the Franco-British Split," was written by the famous French historian and biographer Andre Maurois, and the original was published in the American "Collier's" weekly. As for the remaining manuscripts of "European War Miscellany" that have been put aside, they will continue to be published in the future.</p>
<p>The following is a translation of "The Beginning and End of the Franco-British Split":</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the European war in September 1939, German propaganda has aimed at dividing the Franco-British alliance. For eight months, the French heard every day that France was dragged into the whirlpool of war by Britain; the British themselves did not fight and had never fought a battle; the British only supplied weapons, while the French served as cannon fodder. They also distributed many pictures to the French side, depicting British soldiers pushing French soldiers into a "pool of blood," or British officers playing with semi-nude women in Paris while French soldiers kept watch day and night on the Maginot Line. By June 1940, German propaganda had achieved great success, not only separating Britain and France, but also turning them into enemies. What was the reason?</p>
<p>First, the French had deep-rooted prejudices, which made this propaganda more effective. Long before Germany, Britain was France's historical enemy, and the French still remember this old feud. I have spoken extensively about Franco-British friendship in many provinces, but I was always embarrassed by the unresolved hatred left by the Hundred Years' War. Of course, the late French Foreign Minister Delcassé worked hard to reconcile the two countries in 1904 and establish a consultative relationship; of course, American troops fought alongside French troops from 1914 to 1918; of course, one million British soldiers lie buried in the northern part of France; but since the end of the last European war, misunderstandings between the two countries have continued to arise. Britain feared that France would become too powerful, so it sided with Germany to rearm, and this one wrong decision ultimately left endless troubles.</p>
<p>Around 1930, British Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell said to me: "Since the end of the European war, Britain has made two major mistakes: First, the British believed that France, after its victory, had become Germanized; second, the British believed that Germany, after some changes, had become Britishized."</p>
<p>In 1936, when German troops tore up the Locarno Treaty and reoccupied the Rhineland, British public opinion was still intoxicated with pacifism and refused to assist France.</p>
<p>At that time, a certain important figure in the British political world said to me: "The Germans can do whatever they want in their own garden. Why should we care?" Another said: "You oppose us British only because we are not loyal Frenchmen." But that was not the case. I opposed the British at the time because they were not loyal Britishmen. They did not know that after Germany rearmed, it posed a great military threat to both Britain and France!</p>
<p>My admiration for the British people has been longstanding. During the last European war, I was stationed in the British army as a liaison officer. From my own experience, Britain can certainly be trusted to abide by the treaties it signs. Once the country is in a critical situation, it will take violent actions like any other country, but it can be said that it is definitely not out of malice.</p>
<p>A country is like an individual, and its brutal behavior is actually caused by a sense of inferiority. Britain has no sense of inferiority; on the contrary, it is the opposite. For nine hundred years, Britain's national fortune has been prosperous, which has cultivated an unshakable optimism. Britain does not fight until it has to, and it wins every battle. Therefore, it no longer thinks about the possibility of failure and its terrible consequences. Since the end of the last European war, what the British have hoped for is nothing more than to enjoy the pleasures of the countryside and live their accustomed lives; they have turned a deaf ear to the issue of armaments and war. What British professors have taught young people is that war is the legacy of barbarism and is not difficult to eliminate. Unfortunately, they have not noticed that if justice is not backed by force, evil will prevail.</p>
<p>Britain also has a mistaken illusion that it overvalues the League of Nations, believing that educational arguments can subdue cannons. This kind of ideological confusion, overconfidence, and disregard for reality was bound to cause trouble, as discerning people had long expected. From 1919 to 1939, Britain always enjoyed itself on its green lawns at home. It suddenly woke up after the Munich Conference, but it was too late. Finally, it rose up to fight empty-handed.</p>
<p>This is the second key to the success of German propaganda. They kept nagging in the ears of the French! "Britain has no troops to fight and will make France fight to the last man!" This was somewhat believable. Britain's navy is certainly unmatched in the world, and its air force is also excellent, but on land, the number of British troops and their armaments are insufficient. On a long battle line, they can only guard a short section.</p>
<p>Many French people asked me with sarcasm: "British soldiers? Where are the British soldiers? Are there really British soldiers in France?"</p>
<p>Even so, if Britain could have quickly caught up and formed several divisions after the declaration of war, the French might have turned to trust them. However, the British, whether in nature or in principle, are known for their slowness, which was particularly evident in this war. The trade union refused to cancel the restrictions on working hours, and this situation did not improve until several months later, after trade union representatives were included in the cabinet. Large merchants worried about not being able to maintain foreign markets, and the quantity of goods to be ordered from the United States and Canada was insufficient. Aircraft manufacturing was not successful until the industrial tycoon Lord Beaverbrook came forward to take charge. In March 1940, British experts still disagreed on the design of mass-produced tanks, and French Minister of Armaments Raoul Dautry was surprised to hear this. Commander Piller of the French Northern Army also complained to me: "British soldiers? I know they have excellent qualities. Their soldiers can indeed hold their ground, and their generals are indeed very experienced in combat, but they are unbelievably slow! It has been eight months since the war started, and they only have ten divisions! Based on their conscription quota alone, they should have formed at least thirty divisions! But they are too detailed and too fond of nitpicking. The Germans know the importance of time."</p>
<p>Colonel Teillard, chief of staff of the French liaison mission in the British army, also worriedly said: "I still cannot get accurate information about the number of troops that Britain plans to send to France in the coming months. Sometimes they tell me that four divisions can be sent out before October, and sometimes they say that there will only be one division. Sometimes they plan to form a second army corps, and then they cancel it. In any case, there is not much hope this summer, which is so distressing."</p>
<p>But in April 1940, German propaganda had not yet reached its goal. There were indeed many anti-British people in France, but the general staffs of Britain and France were very sincere to each other, even more so than in 1914. There was also no separation between the naval headquarters of the two countries; the British Admiralty could tell the French Admiralty about all new inventions, and the French Admiralty could provide the British Admiralty with all files for reference.

<p>London – This morning, London's new anti-aircraft artillery once again thwarted the German aircraft trying to raid England, preventing them from flying into the capital to bomb. The anti-aircraft fire net along the southeast coast of England reached a width of ten miles, greatly alarming the raiders. Most of the bombers were driven back, and some even dropped their bombs in the fields and fled. When the air raid alarm started, there was light anti-aircraft fire and the sound of aircraft soaring, coming from far away beyond the clouds. For several hours before midnight, there was a long pause over London, and no anti-aircraft fire was heard. It was heard that early in the evening, six German aircraft invaded the London area. Although the skies over London were very quiet, German aircraft were quite active in other parts of Britain. Southeast England and a coastal village were reported to have been attacked by German aircraft dropping incendiary bombs and oil bombs. A town northwest of Liverpool was attacked at 7 p.m. (United Press report, 31st)</p>

<p>London, Tuesday Night: When British planes attacked Germany, the weather was extremely bad. However, the British planes were not deterred, and the bombing of Berlin and many military and industrial targets was even more intense. The main targets were oil supply centers and refineries and storage facilities, such as those in Magdeburg, Hamborn, and Lunen. Factories in Leipzig and the Krupp factory in Essen were attacked again. A bridge at the port of Stralsund on the Baltic Sea was also hit by a bomb. Other British planes failed to find their intended targets and flew to the Ruhr area and its northern and eastern regions, heavily bombing railway junctions, disrupting transportation between the industrialized west and the rest of Germany. A large fire broke out at a freight yard in Munster within ten minutes of being attacked. Twenty-nine airfields were bombed, fourteen of which caught fire and burned. British planes heavily attacked the refinery areas of Hamborn and Stuttgart, with flames soaring where bombs fell. During the attack on Magdeburg, the explosion of a bomb hitting an oil factory was so powerful that it greatly shook the British planes overhead, and flames shot into the sky in an instant. Hamburg, which had been heavily bombed on Monday night, and the Bremen shipyards and Wilhelmshaven naval base were attacked again, with British planes successively dropping large bombs and incendiary bombs, which exploded in the shipyards. However, due to low clouds and ground fog in much of northwestern Germany, the extent of the damage to the shipyards was unclear. The British air strikes on German railway transport hubs were extensive, with freight yards in Cologne, Hamburg, and Krefeld, and railway junctions in Osnabrück and other places, being heavily bombed. The British plane that started the fire at the Munster freight yard encountered intense anti-aircraft fire, and its wings and fuselage were hit by shell fragments in several places. In an airfield in the Rhine area, a large bomb caused two extremely large explosions, with debris flying into the sky. The shipyards and ships in the ports of Ijmuiden, Vlissingen, and Dunkirk were bombed again by British planes, with large fires breaking out in all except Ijmuiden. The difficulties of British air strikes on Berlin were recently detailed by the pilots who participated in the attacks. The attack took place very early. The first wave of bombers reached Berlin at 8:00 PM. At that time, there was a heavy snowstorm, and it was extremely difficult to find targets. The British planes dropped flares to locate targets and dropped large bombs, but due to the heavy snowfall, the results of the bombing were not very clear. The pilot of the first British plane to reach Berlin said that after takeoff, the weather was clear, the visibility was clear, the sky was cloudless, and the stars were shining. Before long, the weather suddenly changed, with a snowstorm blowing. Snowflakes also flew into the cockpit, and the windshield was completely covered by snow, so he had to rely on instruments for blind flight for a long time. At that time, he still hoped to get out of the snowstorm area before reaching Berlin, but the snowstorm became even worse. However, he still braved the snow to find a target, which was a large power plant, and bombed it. On the way back, he did not leave the snowstorm area until he had flown most of the journey. Another pilot who attacked the outskirts of Berlin said that he also encountered a blizzard, and snow flew into the cockpit. At one point, he was covered in snow and almost became a snowman in flight. When he first encountered the snowstorm, he flew higher, hoping that flying would be easier, but the controls froze, so he lowered his flight and flew at a rate of 2,000 feet per minute for 35 minutes. At one point, he flew into a dense anti-aircraft fire net, but was not injured. Another British bomber was approaching Berlin when it froze due to flying extremely high and spiraled down. The pilot threw down the bombs to reduce the weight of the aircraft, but the aircraft continued to spiral down, so he urgently warned the crew to prepare to bail out. The pilot was only able to control the aircraft when it was about to touch the ground, and then ascended and escaped. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<p>London: Reliable sources say that Italy is planning to establish an autonomous Macedonian state, which includes parts of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria, and is under Italian protection. Another source said that this country will be constitutionally linked to Albania. Well-informed sources say that if Italy occupies the provinces of Salonika and Macedonia in Greece, this plan may be realized. Most of the land of this new Macedonian state will be taken from Yugoslavia, and a smaller portion will be taken from Greece. In addition, Bulgaria will also cede one-tenth of its land to the new country. Moreover, Yugoslavia, considering that Salonika is an important commercial outlet for the country, would in effect be placing Yugoslavia's commerce in mortal danger if Italy occupied Salonika. However, Yugoslavia, fearing German aggression, dares not resolutely send troops to protect Salonika. (United Press, 31st)</p>

<p>Washington: Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox announced yesterday that the Navy Department has obtained 31 auxiliary ships to increase the strength of the US fleet based in Hawaii in the Pacific.

Colonel Knox said that the strength of the US fleet is sufficient to deal with "eventualities." The authorities are still increasing the strength of the fleet in order to enable the fleet to deal with any crisis in any US territory. These newly acquired auxiliary ships will be based in Hawaii, but their main task will be to maintain communication with the US mainland.

<p>Washington: Reliable officials said today that the Philippine constitutional amendment could be submitted to President Roosevelt around November 10. According to well-informed sources, the amendment was drafted by the Philippine Congress and will be signed by Roosevelt without being sent to Congress for approval. The amendment stipulates that the current unicameral system will be changed to a bicameral system for the legislature, and the Philippine president will be allowed to be re-elected twice, but the six-year term will be reduced to four years. Non-official sources said that the president's approval would be delayed, mainly because the US presidential election has not been decided, as this amendment stipulates that the Philippine president can only be re-elected twice, which would hinder Roosevelt's campaign. However, the White House's opinion has not expressed any opposition at this time. The amendment will also allow Philippine President Quezon to obtain military votes. (United Press, 31st)</p>

Over the past 18 months, the immigration process has been carried out continuously under a systematic approach. Countless farmers have arrived in the new areas and immediately began to participate in the work of socialist collective farms.

<h3 id="e75">Grain; 8,700 Tons of Foreign Rice Arrive; Rice Accounts for Three-Quarters, Corn Only One-Quarter <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. The French company's "Songtai" vessel, directly transporting grain from Saigon, was reported yesterday. It is now known that the vessel arrived at the port at noon yesterday, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, carrying 66,806 bags of foreign rice and 20,323 bags of corn, totaling 8,700 tons. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw prices rise due to newly fixed prices abroad. No. 2 Saigon merchants quoted 72 yuan and 71.5 yuan, with 450 tons newly transacted, also agreed upon at 71.5 yuan. Furthermore, the actual quantity of rice arriving recently includes a mix of corn, not as large as rumored in the market. Therefore, those who needed to lose money in the Shanghai rice market before the month, the owners steadfastly refused to sell, and floating more new hoarding took the opportunity to absorb it. Although the actual sales households on this street are offering the average price of rice today, they are not intending to sell briskly, but they are also taking advantage of the low prices to slightly add to their holdings. The market is gradually consolidating, and as a result, the prices of various grades of rice have generally risen by nearly one yuan compared to the previous evening. Reclaimed original bags have reached a spot price of 73 yuan to 74.2 yuan, and November shipments are 71.5 yuan, generally about one yuan higher than the previous market. The total daily transaction volume was 400-500 tons of original bags, and 12,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>New japonica rice and kiln-seed wild rice, etc., continued to arrive at 1,000 to 2,000 shi. On the sales side, seeing the brisk foreign rice market, the situation also tightened. The selling price of new japonica increased by 40 to 50 cents, opening at 77.5 yuan per original bag, and 72.5 yuan and 71 yuan per dan. Kiln-seed also increased by about one yuan, opening at 76 yuan. However, with the sudden surge in the arrival of wild rice, the market became stable, remaining at 79 yuan to 76.8 yuan. The situation for Duyang japonica was similar, with no opening for broken-stem. Both domestic and foreign glutinous rice were slightly more popular and also tighter in color, with Yili and Te Yuan opening at 76 yuan and 75.5 yuan, Changdanbai Yuan at 74.5 yuan, Hong Kong Te Yuan at 73 yuan, and secondary grades down to 69 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Tense Situation of Flour; Gradually Disappearing; The Wheat Market Becomes More Sluggish <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The current flour market situation shows an increasing supply, because since the Chinese mills have increased their batch releases, the street's needs are quite abundant, and the tense situation has long since disappeared invisibly. Under this environment, the number of reclaimed goods flowing out is also gradually increasing, while hoarders are at a loss, and actual sales are observing, resulting in a situation where supply exceeds demand. The price of old-car reclaimed flour is only 18.5 yuan plus fees, and the domestic Shanlu brand is the same price. Yamamoto Street handled 200 to 300 bags. As for foreign flour, with foreign orders arriving soon and prices very reasonable, people's hearts are weakened, and few are entering the market. There were no formal transactions throughout the day.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions are dull and stagnant day after day. Both domestic and foreign arrivals are scarce. Only occasional shipments of a few dozen or hundred bags arrive from nearby areas, all of which are directly delivered to Japanese factories. The market has long been unable to purchase any, and the market is also rarely prosperous. As for transactions in Chinese factories, they are even more quiet.</p>

<p>Yesterday's oil market was sluggish in the morning, but after small Hong Kong dealers continued to inquire, people's hearts inevitably turned active from the continuous sluggish situation. In the afternoon, there were also reports that Hanyun had also inquired, and futures oil first rose. At the tightest time, it had risen by more than three yuan compared to the previous day, but before closing, it fell back by one yuan because the Qingdao market had not yet reported. As a result, spot oil rose by one yuan, and futures oil rose by two yuan. Soybean oil sales were rare, with 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil transacted at a price of 75 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanchi soybean oil at a price of 77 yuan, and 200 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil at a price of 83 yuan to 5 jiao. A total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were transacted at a price of 68.5 yuan to 69 yuan, and 50 pieces for delivery in two weeks were also priced at 69 yuan. More than 100 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 90.5 yuan, rising directly to 98 yuan. 150 barrels for delivery in November were priced at 96.5 yuan to 7 yuan. 600 barrels for delivery in late November were priced at 96.5 yuan, rising to 99.75 yuan, and then falling back to 98.25 yuan. Over 500 barrels for delivery in late December were priced at 98 yuan to 101 yuan, closing at 100 yuan. Also, 500 cans of Qingdao canned oil were priced at 95.5 yuan, and 2,000 cans of Yantai canned oil were priced at 97 yuan and 98 yuan. Today, 250 cans of sesame oil and 745 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 1,475 bags of yellow soybeans were shipped from Tianjin.</p>

China Bank initially issued the November US exchange rate at 6 yuan, but later sold it to speculators, retreating into the six-yuan mark, at 5 yuan 96875. However, China Bank again settled the US exchange rate for the same month with foreign banks, and soon returned to loose to 6 yuan and a half. The current British balance is 3 pence 875, and the US exchange rate is 6 yuan. Compared to the morning opening, the British and American currencies each tightened by 0.03125.</p>
<p>The Market Turned Calm in the Afternoon</p>

<h3 id="e80">Golden Market Excitement; Is Only Temporary <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for current gold cash first rose to 5,600 yuan and then fell back to the 5,500 yuan line. In the morning session, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, people's hearts were excited, and the tendency to buy was dominant. Therefore, the market rose and rose, with silver houses and securities houses purchasing the most. Later, the foreign exchange calmed down, the buying trend dissipated, and securities houses and silver houses all scrambled to sell, and the price was quite sluggish. Although there were those who came out and then re-entered, the rising power was extremely weak. As a result, the closing price was 5,553 yuan, but it was still 38 yuan higher than the previous day. The total daily trading was still strong, at more than 2,000 taels. The price of silverware remained unchanged, and customs gold and other items were still flat.</p>
<p>Cash First Rose Then Fell</p>
<p>Initially, the market was very firm because of the slightly tight foreign exchange and more buyers on the counter. It was calculated that the silver house's doing business with 20 taels was 5,570 yuan, which was the opening price, which was already 35 yuan higher than the previous day. Subsequently, in the buying trend, it rose several dozen yuan again. It was calculated that the silver house entered the gold shop with 10 taels, which was 5,590 yuan. At this time, floating households made a slight settlement, slightly suppressed, it was calculated that the securities gang sold to the silver house 20 taels for 5,560 yuan, but the securities gang entered the gold shop 30 taels, and it rose to 5,580 yuan. However, because money changers and others released, it would fall to the lowest of 5,550 yuan, because the silver house and securities gang immediately bought up when it was cheap, and the lowest was pulled up to 5,600 yuan. It was heard that the foreign exchange was also tight, and it was calculated that the silver house securities gang was 10 taels, which was also 5,600 yuan. By the time of closing, the money changers and gold shops sold together, so they could not stand firm. The closing silver house issued 20 taels to the money changers, which was 5,663 yuan. The initial situation in the afternoon was stable, calculated by the gold and silver shops to make ten taels, which was 5,545 yuan, the silver house again made twenty taels, returning to 5,560 yuan, Naimo a few securities gangs and silver houses came to the market to sell, and finally pressed sharply, calculated by the securities gang out of the money exchange business ten taels, which was 5,525 yuan, Later, Lai Yinhao turned out to be an entry, and retail investors piled in, only to see the market high at 5,560 yuan. As a result, the Yinhao traded 10 taels for 5,553 yuan, as the closing price for the evening, which was 18 yuan higher than the day before, and a total of 85 yuan up and down throughout the day. The price of cash gold sold by the cash shop was more than ten yuan higher than that of gold, and the intake was thirty yuan lower. The current bid gold was fifty or sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Finally Returned to Flat</p>
<p>The exchange price of silverware was hung by 10 yuan at 11 a.m., and the afternoon returned to 10 yuan, and the result did not move. The Datong shop hung up 570 yuan, and the new counterpart was similar to the above price, and the collection was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e81">American Dollar Tickets Well at 7 Points <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the market price of gold has finally slightly risen, so the British and American gold pounds unanimously rose slightly by 5 corners, and British gold tickets were still unattended. The market price was fixed as before, and the US gold ticket had been as high as 16 yuan 1 corner 8 minutes, but after the entry it slightly fell back, and the evening market retreated to 15 yuan 9 corner 8 points, which was still 7 points higher than the 10th. Hong Kong tickets fell slightly after the rise, and the final day was still down 2 points. The rising trend of Japanese gold tickets has been suppressed, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan 5 corners 6 minutes, which was 3 minutes lower than the previous day. The need for Korean tickets has not decreased, and the market price continued to rise, and the evening market was as high as 1 yuan 2 corners 6 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Discount Is About To Disappear <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange clearance bill discount rate fell again, and each thousand yuan was initially discounted at 8 yuan, and then immediately fell to 7 yuan, and the entry was 6 yuan, and then down to 5 yuan in the afternoon, and the discount was 6 yuan, which was 2 yuan smaller than the previous day. The money industry association's split interest rate also fell sharply by 2 minutes, and both morning and afternoon markets were both.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Bank Preparatory Committee; Lowers the Rate of Exchange Allotment; Sets the October Deposit Interest Rate at Three Yuan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry United Preparatory Committee, from today (November 1st), revised the various interest rates as follows, counting (public list borrowing interest rate), national currency 2 jiao 5 fen, exchange allotment 1 jiao 5 fen, (acceptance bill 90-day discount rate) national currency Jiao 5 fen, exchange allotment 1 Jiao 5 points, (the same industry exchange appropriation interest), 1 corner 3 points, (except for interest on deposits), (the same industry exchange split lending owed interest), 1 corner 5 points, (all are calculated per thousand yuan per day).</p>
<p>"Note" The above reconciliation rate, compared with October 1st, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the exchange allotment rate has been reduced by 3 points. The Association has also set the October interest rate for interbank transfer deposits at 3 yuan per thousand (that is, a monthly interest rate of 3%), which is half a yuan lower than in September.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Securities; Domestic Debt Trading; From This Afternoon; All Changed to Use Allotment Heads <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The black market for securities was more tired and weak yesterday, and it returned to a rotating situation, and trading became increasingly scarce. All gangs are very lazy to buy and sell, and the reason is that the ticket discounts of banknotes have gradually disappeared in recent days. The allotment of exchange has become increasingly scarce, and the public debt is based on exchange, but due to the shortage of funds, the transaction cannot be improved, which is also an important reason. Yesterday's trading Hongda had a slight purchase, Chengkang always sold, Lianhe advanced and then came out, and Yuxing still had a cage. The remaining buyers were Tongshen Hengfu Xie Xing Yuan and Yongkang, and the sellers were Gongmao and Hu Heji and No. 25, etc. The market was first rotating, and then slightly tired in the afternoon, and the result was slightly back to the small two corners to six corners, and the number of transactions was 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>After the closing yesterday, all securities colleagues were convened by Lianhe Hao for a meeting on the 7th floor, and more than 30 companies attended the meeting. At that time, it was resolved that the trading in the morning would still be settled by exchange, and from the afternoon onwards, all would be changed to allotment heads, and the entire certificate would be collected and resolved uniformly with allotment head bills, and all customer deposits would be mutually allocated to allotment heads with a 5-yuan discount rate. Because the banknote discount has been getting smaller and the exchange bills on the market have gradually disappeared, in order to promote business, all colleagues unanimously agree with this move.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Huashang Electric Power were traded at a price of 7 yuan. The stock market's actions seem more optimistic. Hutchison Whampoa has returned to a leading position, and it rose to 90 yuan at the beginning of the morning opening, and then continued to rise to 92 yuan, but most of the transaction price was 91 yuan, because the stock's soaring affected the stock prices of various trust companies, and all of them have made progress, and the remaining stocks have also been helped more or less. Rubber stocks, allowing the stocks of each Dutch company in the Dutch East Indies, have a strong trend, because the good interim interest is already in sight. The general public feels that yesterday's market purchases seem to be over-volume, so it is expected that there may be more long orders that are impatient today, making prices relatively cheaper.</p>
<p>London 30th (Wednesday) Telegraph, today the listing prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are still flat and sluggish, and the market is generally not prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Yarn Flowers; The Competition Between Bulls and Bears Is Fierce; Double Horse Hovers Around 1,200 <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The trend of the yarn market is erratic and impermanent. It rises and falls sharply. This is because speculative chips are flooded, and the competition between bulls and bears is fierce, resulting in inconsistent people's hearts, but actual transactions are becoming more and more stagnant. However, there is a part of the "1,200 yuan mark broke and rushed in" more people, while profit-takers made up for it, so both sides drove forward side by side, and the market turned from low to high. In short, looking at the overall situation, the current is still in the disk file in and out. Today, 635 pieces of existing yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The current yarn Chen opened because of the panic on the previous day, and people's hearts looked down. The opening price of 20 double horses was 1,200 yuan, a slight increase to 206 yuan. Xuan fell to 1,194 yuan due to short-selling activities, and once the mark was broken, the short-sellers thought of piling in again, and a certain long-term also came to add chips, and Chawen foreign exchange slightly shrank, and the buying trend turned up, and the market price gradually picked up, rising to 1,217 yuan, the long-term reappeared, and the actual sales stagnated, and it was slightly small to 1,207 yuan, and eventually felt dry on the table, and the buying trend suddenly came, It is actually the reason for the speculative heat. The market has risen step by step to 1,230 yuan, and after closing, it has returned to a small 23 yuan. It is estimated that the statistics of the transactions in each gang's mouth for half a day are 6,530 packages, and the market is up 19 yuan. The amount of each gang's mouth is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Statistics 6.540</p>
<p>There is an inquiry about the market price of 7 cotton yarns. It is found that there is no transaction in the market recently, so this yarn is sold exclusively in the mainland and is prohibited from leaving the country, so there is no market. As for converting the price of 20 yarns, the current market is chaotic and there is no standard, and it is also difficult to estimate. It is estimated that it is 70 yuan to 100 yuan lower than 20 yarns, but according to the investigation of each factory, because of the cost relationship, they are unwilling to spin this yarn, because the profit of 20 yarns is thicker.</p>

<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai Port has been particularly sluggish in recent days, and all parties are unusually quiet. Those who have raw cotton in stock are unwilling to sell at this time of fatigue, and the stock of raw cotton in the market is not abundant, and the price of raw cotton will not fall, and the minds of colleagues continue to be very high.</p>

<p>The woolen cloth market within the city remains prosperous. Retail shops, tailors, and overcoat makers are all experiencing brisk sales. Overcoat woolens, autumn flower woolens, haircloth, and single-sided flower woolens are selling particularly well. However, sales to traveling merchants are quite sluggish. Due to blocked transportation routes in the inland areas and frequent suspension of postal packages, and the strict controls imposed in the occupied areas, even with military expenses allocated to find ways to transport goods at risk, there are often dangers of loss or punishment. This has led to complaints from merchants in outer regions who, despite offering high prices, struggle to obtain goods. It has been observed recently that only merchants from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Xiamen are still seeking to purchase woolen cloth, a decrease of ninety percent compared to the past. Those in the trade who specialized in catering to traveling merchants are now mostly suspending operations, changing their business focus to serving the local market.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Seafood: Tapioca Flour Continues to Rise; Black Pepper Drops Slightly <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The supply of tapioca flour has been dwindling recently, leading to a gradual decrease in stock levels, while demand remains strong, driving prices upward. Currently, Flying Unicorn and Human Gun labels are both selling at 72 yuan, while 3X and KG labels are at 71 yuan. Anchor, Peacock, and Double T are all priced at 60 yuan, and No. 3 flour is at 47 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Black pepper has become sluggish and weak, with both Black Large and No. 1 Pepper priced at 105 yuan, down 4 yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Metals: Wire Rod Follows Steel Nails into Flatness and Weakness <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Due to quiet trading conditions, the price of steel nails from local factories remains stagnant. Yesterday, the quoted price was still around 55 yuan. Demand from the construction sector in Covered Wood Street is slack, and sales to merchants in outer regions are also shallow. Although the Yunnan-Burma Road is open to merchants from Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the volume of goods transported is still limited, and the general atmosphere of stagnation is difficult to break. Daily sales volume is very small, which also affects the market for its raw materials (wire rod and wire). Besides being a raw material for steel nails, new wire rod is also used by wire mesh factories and screw factories, but the quantity is small compared to the large demand from nail factories, so the impact on market prices is still limited. Currently, the price is around 17 yuan per dan (unit of weight).</p>

<h3 id="e93">U.S. New Consul General Issues Public Notice Yesterday: Urges Citizens to Leave in a Timely Manner; Advised to Take Advantage of Convenient Transportation to Pack Up and Return Home; No Guarantee that Ships Will Continue to Operate Smoothly Thereafter; Rumor that First Ship to Evacuate Nationals May Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Far East situation, on the surface, it appears to have eased in the past few days. However, the U.S. government, with foresight, believes that this temporary lull should not be regarded as evidence of a stabilized situation. Therefore, in addition to deploying thirty-one additional auxiliary ships to join the Asian fleet to strengthen its capabilities in preparation for emergencies, the United States is also continuing the evacuation of American citizens from the Far East. The newly appointed U.S. Consul General, Mr. Lockhart, in accordance with this policy, issued his first public notice to American citizens in Shanghai yesterday morning, urging them to take advantage of the available transportation facilities, emphasizing that such convenience cannot be guaranteed indefinitely. Mr. Lockhart's notice particularly emphasized this advice, which applies to women, children, and men who do not need to stay in Shanghai. Mr. Lockhart further stated that according to reports from the American President Lines, there are still many first and second class seats available on the Mondale, scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>Rumor: Mondale to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping company, the first ship sent by the U.S. government to evacuate people from the Far East, the Mondale, arrived in Yokohama the day before yesterday and departed for Shanghai at 8:00 PM that evening. According to its planned route, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (2nd) morning to carry out its mission. However, it is said that the number of evacuees on board is not large, including the dependents of the U.S. Marine Corps leaving Shanghai, totaling about 300 people. According to the U.S. side, there are approximately 4,200 applications for evacuation. However, only a small number will leave Shanghai in the first batch. It is said that the Mondale still has 70 first-class cabins that have not been booked. This is not because American citizens are not enthusiastic about supporting the government, but because American citizens in Shanghai and other places have not had time to wind up their businesses and households in China. Those who are unable to afford the huge expenses are unable to bear it, while those who are wealthy have huge assets in Shanghai and are unwilling to leave immediately.</p>
<p>Other Two Ships: Cabins Are Full</p>
<p>In the first week of November, American citizens can still take two other President Lines ships: the President Pierce, which arrived in Shanghai from Little Luzon and Hong Kong at 2:45 PM yesterday, berthing at buoy No. 12/13 in the Huangpu River, and will leave for the United States this morning; and the President Coolidge, which is currently en route to Little Luzon via Hong Kong, will sail to Shanghai again on the 5th of this month, and then leave for the United States on the 6th. It is said that the cabins on both ships are fully booked.</p>
<p>Washington Ticket Price Inquiry</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the American President Lines, the first ship for evacuation, the President Malipoa, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and after a few days, it will pass through Qinhuangdao, Kobe, Honolulu, and arrive in San Francisco. The third ship, the Washington, will arrive in Shanghai on the 7th and depart from Shanghai via Manila and Los Angeles on the 21st, scheduled to arrive in California on December 8th. The ticket prices for the first-class cabins on this ship are the same as those of regular mail ships. There are 298 berths and 47 smaller berths in tourist-class cabins. The ticket price for berths is US$240 to US$260, and the ticket price for smaller berths is US$190 to US$210. The European third-class cabins include 149 berths and 19 smaller berths, with ticket prices of US$150 for berths and US$100 for smaller berths. The cabins on regular mail ships, namely the Pierce and Coolidge, are fully booked, but there are many vacancies on the evacuation ships.</p>
<p>Appealing to the Government: Subsidize Travel Expenses</p>
<p>American citizens in Shanghai are deeply dissatisfied with the reply from Washington refusing to subsidize the travel expenses for the evacuation of American citizens from the Far East, because the most economical ticket price for evacuation ships is US$250 to US$300, which is equivalent to 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese yuan per person. The income of most American citizens in Shanghai is in legal tender, making it difficult to raise this large sum of money. It is even more difficult for a head of household to bear the travel expenses for several people. Yesterday, Mr. Elcott expressed his dissatisfaction on behalf of American citizens during a radio broadcast, saying that the U.S. government's advice to evacuate citizens focuses on women and children who do not need to stay, but women and children have no money on hand and should be given relief. The American Citizens Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai sympathize with this view and are currently discussing further steps. They will jointly send a telegram to Washington on the 1st or 2nd to request the State Department to reconsider its decision and provide appropriate assistance to American citizens who are unable to evacuate.</p>
<p>Advising Officers: Move into the Defense Zone</p>
<p>An officer of the U.S. Navy's 4th Marine Regiment stated yesterday that regarding the notice issued by the headquarters of the 4th Marine Regiment, instructing officers residing in the French Concession and other areas of the International Settlement to move into the designated area so that they can be summoned at any time in an emergency, the officers have not taken any action for the time being. Most officers have obtained the consent of the competent authorities and plan to move after the ships carrying American evacuees have sailed.</p>

<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that Mr. Buttrick, who has served at the American Consulate General in Shanghai for six years, will leave Shanghai for Washington tomorrow (the 1st) on the President Pierce. Mr. Buttrick told reporters this morning (the 31st) that he currently does not have a confirmed position and therefore does not wish the newspapers to publish a major announcement about his departure. According to reports, Mr. Buttrick enjoys a high reputation among the American community and all sectors of Shanghai. In May, the former American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, was transferred to become the first American Minister to Australia, and Mr. Buttrick took over as Deputy Consul General. He remained in that role until the new Consul General, Mr. Lockhart, arrived in Shanghai last week and took over. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Mr. Buttrick also served as the "unofficial" spokesperson for the American Consulate, maintaining close contact with newspaper reporters. As for whether Mr. Buttrick will be transferred to another position after his trip to Washington, no announcement has been made yet. However, it is rumored that Mr. Buttrick will take a short vacation in the United States and then take on a new position.</p>

<p>Yesterday marked the third-week anniversary of the Lone Army's retreat from the Sihang Warehouse into the concession under orders. Commander Xie of the Lone Army in Jiaozhou Road held a reception for the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon at the barracks after holding a sports meet, in commemoration. Approximately 200 guests from all walks of life attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The detailed information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<p>Commemoration of the Retreat Three Weeks Ago</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the Sino-Japanese War extended to Shanghai, as the Chinese army shifted westward due to strategic reasons, the Chinese army stationed at the Sihang Warehouse north of the Suzhou River, led by Commander Xie Jinyuan, made a final stand. After that, they accepted the invitation of the concession authorities and withdrew the entire battalion into the concession, residing in the current barracks on Jiaozhou Road. Commander Xie organized a commemorative ceremony yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. in the camp's open space to commemorate this heroic and solemn day, and also invited the Shanghai press to join in the celebration.</p>
<p>The Entire Lone Army is Inspired</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, more than 200 youths and students were invited. The Lone Army barracks specially assigned ushers to maintain order and receive the guests. At 11 a.m., the closing ceremony of the Lone Army sports meet was held. Commander Xie and guests gave speeches to encourage each other. At noon, the New Art Troupe, organized by outside youths, performed. The Lone Army drama troupe also performed the play "Until Tomorrow," which was very successful. The entire Lone Army was inspired yesterday. They all held optimistic views about the future and expressed their intention to continue working hard. Commander Xie frequently shook hands with visiting guests, and was extremely busy. Yesterday, the White Russian Merchant Corps re-imposed martial law around the barracks. Corps members patrolled with guns from time to time. Guests entering and leaving had to leave their names, and restrictions were somewhat strict.</p>
<p>Admonishing Officers to Sharpen Their Will</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, in addition to more than 20 reporters from various newspapers, Wu Xuecheng, Guan Youwen, members of the Lone Army Sports Meet Preparatory Committee, and Wang Huaiqi, Wang Xiang, Zhang Jiazhen, Yang Yongcan, and more than 30 other sports representatives from various schools attended this great commemorative festival. At half past four, the ceremony began. After the rituals were performed, Commander Xie gave a speech to all officers and soldiers, and used General Chiang's recently issued admonition of "Sharpening Their Will" to inspire them. At five o'clock, a dinner was held, with dishes made by the officers and soldiers of the battalion themselves, which were substantial and palatable. After the hosts and guests wished each other success, they dispersed at six o'clock.</p>

<p>Since the Chongqing Winter Clothing Donation Movement General Association promoted the nationwide micro-donation of winter clothing, people from all over the country and abroad have been enthusiastically donating. Under the central leadership, the Shanghai winter clothing donation was promoted by the Micro-Donation慰勞 代金 Committee, following the precedent of soliciting funds for military support during the Spring Festival, and assessed quotas to various trade associations and school organizations. Although the people of Shanghai are in a special environment, they continue the spirit of the past in donating money for winter clothing, and have actively contributed. However, the original deadline was yesterday, but because the procedures for collecting and submitting donations by various trade associations, schools, newspaper offices, and organizations were complex, they could not be completed in time, and the total amount of one million yuan was not reached. The Donation Committee, in view of the enthusiasm of all sectors and the desire for an extension, so that organizations that have not yet participated can have the opportunity to fully serve, the Donation Committee, in addition to sending a special telegram to the Chongqing Winter Clothing Donation General Association the day before yesterday to report on the solicitation situation and request a delay, has specifically decided to continue the extension for one month from today, until the end of November, when the entire process will be completed and will not be delayed any further.</p>

<p>Chinese coastal and Yangtze River shipping has always been dominated by the British-owned Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire shipping companies. Since the war on the Yangtze River shifted westward, foreign ships have suspended operations and Japanese ships have dominated. As for coastal North and South Pacific shipping, the Japanese army controls various supplies in the northern ports, so business is slightly inferior. Although Shantou and Guangzhou have fallen in the South Pacific, Hong Kong is British territory, and goods are transported south to Hong Kong as a central point. British ships still maintain the leading position in transportation. Passengers, regardless of whether they are traveling to North or South Pacific ports, still recognize British ships as reliable, and ticket prices have been increased repeatedly. It is now learned that Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have recently agreed on new prices, increasing the previous prices by 10% to 25%. The new prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>North Pacific Route</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Qingdao: First Class (Large Dining Room) 50 yuan, Second Class (Official Cabin) 40 yuan, Third Class (Cabin) 30 yuan, Fourth Class (Steerage) 18 yuan. To Weihaiwei: First Class 60 yuan, Second Class 44 yuan, Third Class 35 yuan, Fourth Class 24 yuan. To Yantai: First Class 64 yuan, Second Class 52 yuan, Third Class 37 yuan, Fourth Class 26 yuan. To Tianjin: First Class 80 yuan, Second Class 60 yuan, Third Class 48 yuan, Fourth Class 35 yuan.</p>
<p>South Pacific Route</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Wenzhou: First Class 50 yuan, Second Class 40 yuan, Third Class 30 yuan, Fourth Class 18 yuan. To Fuzhou: First Class 60 yuan, Second Class 45 yuan, Third Class 35 yuan, Fourth Class 25 yuan. To Xiamen: First Class 75 yuan, Second Class 50 yuan, Third Class 40 yuan, Fourth Class 30 yuan. To Shantou: First Class 80 yuan, Second Class 60 yuan, Third Class 45 yuan, Fourth Class 30 yuan. To Hong Kong: First Class 100 yuan, Second Class 80 yuan, Third Class 60 yuan, Fourth Class 40 yuan. To Guangzhou: First Class 110 yuan, Second Class 90 yuan, Third Class 65 yuan, Fourth Class 45 yuan. However, after the fall of Guangzhou, British ships suspended operations. Although the Japanese side nominally opened the Pearl River, the customs and handling of goods for export are too harsh, so British ships still do not go to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Shanghai Defense Line</p>
<p>"Both Wan Estuary and Beihai": From Shanghai to Haikou: First Class 130 yuan, Second Class 100 yuan, Third Class 70 yuan, Fourth Class 50 yuan. To Beihai: First Class 150 yuan, Second Class 120 yuan, Third Class 80 yuan, Fourth Class 60 yuan. To Haiphong: First Class 200 yuan, Second Class 150 yuan, Third Class 100 yuan, Fourth Class 75 yuan. Head tax also applies: First Class 8 yuan, Second Class 4 yuan, Third and Fourth Class 2 yuan. British ships on the Shanghai defense line have also temporarily suspended operations.</p>

<p>After Admiral Hart's private yacht, the Isabel, of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month with Admiral Hart from North China, it has been anchored on the Bund outside the French Concession for a long time. In late this month, after Hart himself went to Manila on the Augustus, the Isabel did not accompany him due to Shanghai's defense relationship. According to reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Isabel is scheduled to go upstream from Shanghai next week, passing through Zhenjiang and Nanjing, and ending at Wuhu, for a routine winter cruise.

<h3 id="e103">America Decides Not to Abandon Shanghai - Evacuation of Overseas Chinese is a Liquidation with Japan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The "Millard's Review" published this week has a comment by foreign economic commentator Ahlex on the fact that the United States cannot abandon Shanghai. Currently, the overseas Chinese who are about to withdraw from Shanghai are only women and children. Men may never leave Shanghai, and the women and children who have withdrawn may return to Shanghai in the near future and find that their men in Shanghai are safe and sound and operating as usual. Perhaps an emergency will occur, and American businessmen will also have to withdraw, but even under this circumstance, one cannot have the illusion that overseas Chinese will withdraw forever. Even if they have to leave Shanghai, when the United States settles accounts with Japan, American commerce in Shanghai will inevitably be forced to a short-term standstill, but there will soon be a recovery period. The United States was unable to obtain the cooperation of the United Kingdom in opposing Japan in 1931-32, and had to acquiesce to Japan's forced implementation of the "New Order" in Manchuria, and the same is true in North China.</p>
<p>The Center of Far East Commerce is in Shanghai</p>
<p>But if Japan believes that it can safely force its "New Order" on American commerce in Shanghai, it will make a huge mistake. The United States believes that Shanghai is the center of Far East commerce and is extremely important to American commerce. Under no circumstances will it willingly be sacrificed to the "New Order" policy. Since this year, the commerce between the United States and various countries in the Far East is very different from the past. The trend of Southeast Asia and China is increasing day by day, while Japan has maintained a fixed state at the beginning of this year, and has been decreasing day by day in recent months. The trend of American Far East trade is closely related to its Far East policy. All the countries where American trade has a special increase are outside Japan's sphere of influence. Even if there is a country with a decreasing trend, it is in a zone where Japan is forcing the implementation of a new economic order. The US State Department has issued several warnings to the American business community, saying that the huge amount of commerce between the United States and Japan a few years ago was a temporary phenomenon and will eventually decline. This is exactly in line with the current facts.</p>
<p>American Commerce in North China is Excluded</p>
<p>Before the Sino-Japanese War, the United States traded with Japan about three to four times as much as it traded with China. In the first two years after the start of the war, Japan's trade with the United States was almost five or six times as much as China's trade with the United States. But this year, Japan's trade with the United States is almost less than twice as much as China's trade with the United States. American trade in North China has almost been excluded by Japan. Only in Shanghai can American goods still be imported into China without Japanese interference, and Chinese goods cannot be exported to the United States without being obstructed by Japan. As a result, in the past three quarters of this year, Shanghai alone accounted for 70% of American imports to China and 80% of Chinese exports to the United States. Under these circumstances, there is no doubt that the United States is unwilling to see Shanghai commerce destroyed by Japan's "New Order."</p>
<p>The Facts are the Opposite of What Japan Propagates</p>
<p>If Japan completely controls Shanghai, Japan will use the same means in Shanghai as it did in North China, and American commerce will become the remnant of Japanese commerce. American commerce in China will also disappear with Shanghai. In the past ten years, Japan has tried its best to persuade the United States not to oppose Japan's expansion of territory, saying that this can develop economic resources and benefit the United States. However, the facts are enough to overturn Japan's propaganda. In addition to not being able to obtain additional commercial benefits from Japan's expansion, American commercial activities are also prohibited wherever the Japanese flag flies. Facts have proven that Japan's continental expansion policy is the mortal enemy of American Far East commercial activities. American Far East commerce can only prosper where Japan's iron fist cannot reach.</p>

<p>After French ships resumed sailing on the Shanghai-Vietnam route, the number of ships operating has been increased repeatedly. First, the Ros, Los, and Kindia came to Shanghai and have decided to resume sailing from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Guangdong and the Songtai, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, have followed. There are now five ships operating on the Shanghai defense line. The bulk of imports is foreign rice and pearl rice. The Songtai is carrying a huge amount of 66,000 bags of foreign rice. The exports are mostly steel. The Songtai is scheduled to load cargo on the 4th and export it to Gongfang on the 5th. All five ships are cargo ships and do not have passenger berths. There is also the Datnam mail ship operating on the new route, which has first, second, third, and fourth class passenger berths and is luxuriously equipped. It is scheduled to go to Japan next Monday, return to Shanghai on the 13th, and go to Little Luzon from Shanghai on the 14th and return to Saigon. The Xijiang was also originally participating in the Shanghai-Vietnam route, but was detained by the Japanese navy for carrying military supplies to Yangon, and there has been no news of its release so far.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Telephone Rate Increase Issue - Not Yet Discussed - Because the French Municipal Council Has Not Replied - Most Chinese Oppose It <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The issue of telephone rate increases has already aroused the concern of tens of thousands of telephone users in this port. After the telephone company submitted a request to the Public Concession 工部局 to increase rates, the 工部局 originally scheduled to submit it for discussion at the board meeting this Wednesday. However, because the French Municipal Council's reply on the rate increase opinion has not yet been received, it has not been submitted for discussion. It must be considered after the French Municipal Council replies. However, according to the opinions of some Chinese, they all believe that the reason for the telephone company's rate increase this time is to add 16,000 new telephone sets for new users who have recently registered with the company. The company has requested the 工部局 to require a rate increase because the purchase of parts and materials is currently expensive. However, Shanghai's current prosperity is abnormal. Whether these 16,000 new users are needed is questionable. Moreover, since telephone calls have been calculated by decision, users can no longer afford it. Therefore, all sectors of the Chinese community hope that the 工部局 will carefully review this issue.</p>

<p>After the East Zhejiang Chinese army recovered Keqiao, Shaoxing, and nearby important strongholds, the Japanese army retreated to Xiaoshan.

<h3 id="e107">Evaluation Committee Asks Both Authorities to Encourage Citizens to Order Rice in Groups - Preparedness is Better Than Unpreparedness to Prevent操縱 at Any Time - Flat Rice Sales Continue This Afternoon <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>In order to continue benefiting the common people, the Shanghai 平糶 Committee has decided to handle the seventh phase of flat rice sales. It is now scheduled to start at the same time at 60 平糶 places in the two concessions from 2 p.m. today. Anyone who purchases flat rice can buy rice tickets nearby and then receive rice at the rice distribution point. Each person is limited to purchasing 4 市斤 of rice for 1 national currency per day. At that time, the police authorities of the two concessions will send detectives to maintain order at each 平糶 place, and all civilians purchasing rice must follow the established regulations. The 工部局 has also made a public announcement.</p>
<p>Rice Evaluation</p>
<p>The committee sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, saying, "We have checked that our committee has repeatedly received instructions from your bureau to resume the evaluation of foreign rice, and that the evaluation standards are to be based on the cost plus reasonable profits. We convened a meeting on the 29th of this month to discuss this matter. We all believe that the current market price in Shanghai is already lower than the price in the production area. If we follow your bureau's instructions and add profits and losses, the price will exceed the market price by a large margin. If we announce the evaluation at this time, it may easily cause suspicion among those outside who do not know the truth. According to the initial month, the highest fixed price of No. 2 Saigon was 79 yuan and 6 corners, and then gradually decreased. By the 15th of this month, it was 75 yuan and 8 corners, and on the 17th it was 73 yuan and 6 corners, all of which have been detailed in previous letters. Now, based on the production price on the day of the decision meeting (29th), it is 71 yuan, plus a temporary military insurance of 2 yuan and 5 corners (this military insurance will be continued in the future, depending on the situation), and a loss and other expenses of 3 yuan, for a total cost of 76 yuan and 5 corners per bag, which is equivalent to 61 yuan per stone. The market price in Shanghai on that day was exactly 61 yuan.</p>
<p>Barely Covering Costs</p>
<p>There are no reasonable profits included. As for the goods ordered previously, some have not yet been fully loaded on the ship, and the losses are already considerable, exceeding 10% and more. Under these circumstances, rice merchants inevitably feel deeply troubled by the issue of renewing orders. Even if the production price on the 29th was the lowest in a month, no one ordered it because the rice merchants were unable to do so. It seems that whether the subsequent sources can be continuous and whether the market price can remain stable for a long time is a big question. Therefore, the key today seems not to be in the urgent determination of the selling price, but in the method of thickening the reserves. In addition to persuading the industry to renew orders by various rice industry groups, we plan to ask your bureau to encourage citizens to actively participate in the group purchases of the Civil Food Regulation Association, or to prepare more purchases while the market price is relatively low. In this way, with thicker reserves, the rice market will be stable. The above is the result of the discussion at this meeting. We are submitting this letter for your inspection and instructions. We are infinitely grateful. Also, from the 25th of last month to yesterday,</p>
<p>Gongmi has been shipped</p>
<p>to more than 130,000 bags. The French mail ship "Dadao" arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Shuntai Wharf, carrying more than 40,000 bags of Gongmi. As for the French mail ship "Bangkok," it is also on its way to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai before the 5th of this month. The ship also contains about 40,000 bags of foreign rice. According to the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, as of yesterday, the amount of rice in storage has increased significantly.</p>

The victim was Sun Zhizhai, also known as Bo Sheng, a native of Changshu and the owner of the hostel. He was sixty-two years old and wealthy. Before the war, he resided in his hometown, but he often traveled between Changshu and Shanghai. After the "August 13th" incident, his hometown fell, and he brought his family to Shanghai, residing on the fifth floor of the New Huizhong Hostel. Unexpectedly, he was targeted by bandits. Three bandits abducted Sun from the hostel's corridor, forced him into a black car that was waiting in front of the hostel, and sped away. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Descending to the Office, Forcibly Put into a Car</p>
<p>At around 8:45 yesterday morning, Sun went down to the accounting room to work after breakfast, as usual. He took the elevator downstairs and had only taken a few steps out of the elevator door when three kidnappers suddenly appeared. Two of them were holding pistols and had been lying in wait by the corridor. Upon seeing Sun, they pointed their guns at him without asking questions to intimidate him. Two bandits held him on either side, slowly led him out, and forced him into a black car with license plate number 5624, which was waiting in front of the hostel. The car sped west, turning onto Fuzhou Road. A clerk in the accounting room witnessed the scene and immediately reported it to the Old Zha Police Station. At that time, nearby patrol officers had also heard the news and reported it. A Western police officer jumped into another car and chased after them, but by the time they reached the Waibaidu Bridge on the Bund, the bandits' car was already gone without a trace, so they turned back.</p>
<p>Car Found, Victim Missing</p>
<p>It was later learned that two customers had suddenly come to the New Asia &amp; Co. car rental agency at 422 Tiantong Road in Hongkou an hour earlier, ordering a driver to take the car to the Paramount Ballroom entrance on YuYuan Road, where another bandit was waiting to board. Then, they ordered the driver to go to Kaina Road, where the bandits threatened the driver with a gun and then forced him out of the car, taking over the driving duties themselves. An hour later, that same car was used to kidnap Sun Zhizhai. The car driver reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and at 12:10 noon, the car was discovered near the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai. Sun's whereabouts remained unknown until evening. The Old Zha Police Station is currently investigating.</p>

<p>The situation in Hongkou yesterday morning was tense for a while. At the time, the Japanese army increased patrols along Suzhou Creek, ZhaPu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge, searching pedestrians for an hour. According to a Pingming News Agency reporter, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Wuchang Road and ZhaPu Road. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, thought a major incident had occurred and dispatched a large number of Japanese soldiers to the scene and along the river bridges to maintain order. After investigation, it was found to be a revenge killing. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, Huang Dabao, a 34-year-old Hubei native, was walking along the intersection of Wuchang Road and ZhaPu Road when he was suddenly shot four or five times. Three bullets hit his back and left leg, and he fell to the ground on the spot. He was taken to the Bazilu Sanatorium. The murderer escaped without a trace. When the Japanese army maintained order after the incident, local residents were greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>Li Jinyuan, a 25-year-old rogue from Yangzhou residing at 183 Lakenna Road (now Huanghe Road) in the French Concession, and his accomplice Yang Honggen from Suzhou went to the entrance of Dunheli Lane at 95 Julaida Road at three o'clock yesterday afternoon to extort protection money from a Korean man selling morphine there. They failed, leading to a conflict, which escalated into violence. Both Li and Yang were stabbed with a bayonet. Yang Honggen was lightly injured and fled with his wound, while Li Jinyuan was stabbed in the middle of his left arm and thigh. Due to a ruptured blood vessel, he bled profusely and collapsed on the spot, dying before he could be treated. The Korean man, seeing that he had caused a fatal disaster, fled without a trace. Passersby reported to the French Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Home for an autopsy. Li Shuangyuan, the victim's older brother, also arrived at the scene after hearing the news to inquire about the incident, and he will report to the Second Special Court today to send personnel to examine the body.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 28th of this month, a man with a gunshot wound to the head suddenly sought treatment at the Sanmin Hospital at 70 North Henan Road. The hospital reported to the police station, which ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that the man, named Daguji, was a Korean, and he was transferred to the Hongkou Fumin Hospital. The New Zha Police Station, led by Western Detective Chief Shalei and Chinese Detective Ruan Yao, conducted a detailed investigation and learned that Daguji was actually an armed robber, possessing two pistols. He had met at the Yanziwo (Swallow's Nest) on the second floor of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road with</p>
<p>A Mixed-Race Man</p>
<p>Luo Zhen (29 years old, father was British, mother was Chinese, not recognized as British, previously a proofreader at a newspaper office at 130 Edward Road). Both were in financial straits and, in September this year, carrying weapons, they had the idea to rob a restaurant at the intersection of Wuma Road and Henan Road. They robbed 250 yuan in cash. Afterwards, they formed a gang and robbed several restaurants on YuQiaQing Road and Guangxi Road, sharing the loot. On the evening of the 27th of this month at 9:00 PM, Daguji and Luo Zhen each carrying a pistol, went to the Wuweizhai Restaurant at 76 Jing'an Temple Road, robbing 500 yuan in legal tender and fleeing. The accountant Bao Jixiang</p>
<p>Followed and Chased Them Out</p>
<p>He saw them emerge from Lane 70, hailed a rickshaw, and went to Guling Road, then reported to Chinese constable No. 2768, who stepped forward to arrest them, ordering them to stop. They did not listen. At that time, Luo escaped, but Daguji fled into the doorway of No. 67 in a certain lane, and the constable shot him down. He then turned around to arrest the other robber but failed. Unexpectedly, when the constable returned to the lane, the wounded bandit had escaped, leaving only a pool of blood on the ground. It was discovered that after being wounded, Daguji still hired a rickshaw and went to various</p>
<p>Hospitals Seeking Treatment</p>
<p>But all refused him. Finally, he was arrested at the Sanmin Hospital and confessed that Luo Zhen was hiding at No. 2, Lane 154, North Henan Road. Luo was arrested there at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, and a pistol and six bullets were confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan stated the above situation and requested detention. When questioned, Luo Zhen confessed in English that he and Daguji had committed the robberies. Judge Liu ruled that Luo would be detained pending further interrogation in fourteen days.</p>

<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>The Di Feng Road running north-south intersects with the Yu Yuan Road running east-west, lying in wait. On the road running east-west, there's a barbed wire fence, and in front of it stands a yellow-uniformed man with an exotic flair, his hand resting imposingly on the hilt of his command saber.</p>
<p>Private cars passing through have to rely on "luck." If he's in a good mood, he'll give it a quick check; otherwise, he'll just flick his thumb back and wave, and you can breathe a sigh of relief, escaping the "checkpoint," your anxious heart finally able to calm down.</p>
<p>On the south side, buses and trams can't escape the net. They must be checked one by one, and passengers must disembark and register. Because registering passengers on each vehicle takes time, trams and buses are "stockpiled" — not in the sense of becoming a "rare commodity," but instead experiencing a decline in business to the point of being "desolate enough to catch sparrows."</p>
<p>As one car after another comes up, the one registering in front doesn't move, and those behind aren't allowed to advance, so they have to stop on the east end of the north-south road, unable to cross the street. Consequently, the long line of cars can extend to fifteen or sixteen vehicles. Trams interspersed with buses can sometimes be seen when taking a turn from Jessfield Road. It's said that double-decker buses were even worse and slower to register at first, but now that they've switched to "single-decker buses," things have improved a lot.</p>
<p>On the north side, rows of people can pass without being checked or registered. So people pass by on the north-side sidewalk. Passengers who disembarked from the "double-decker bus" on Jing'an Temple Road wouldn't even bother to switch to a "single-decker bus," preferring to walk across Di Feng Road to get on the bus, avoiding a lot of trouble. As a result, the bus stop near the "Foreign School" is crowded.</p>
<p>However, the cars coming out from inside are packed with people, but since they're going to the concession, they don't care.</p>
<p>A Row of People Registering</p>
<p>On the sidewalk south of Yu Yuan Road, there's a small table where someone is managing the registration process, with guards standing nearby.</p>
<p>"What's your surname? What's your name? Where do you live? What do you do for a living? Why are you here?" A series of identical questions, as if coming from a model, and the pencil mechanically scribbles across the paper.</p>
<p>One by one, they line up, write, and then leave. The car engine sounds, and another one follows.</p>
<p>There are quite a few cars stopped behind, and the ticket sellers and drivers are really annoyed, so they run out to chat by the side of the vehicles.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jin Fu, bring those two 'shells' over here!" a driver shouts, not far from the barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>Several modern girls, holding thick foreign books in their hands, walk past the "lockdown line" with smiles on their faces, rushing to catch the bus.</p>
<p>"Bye-Bye! Lili!" a girl shouts, waving a hand as she runs over.</p>
<p>The car behind that's "finished" registering comes up!</p>
<p>Two Flags</p>
<p>Past the middle section of the "blockade line," things "seem normal," "peaceful as usual." However, No. 668 Lane is a bit different.</p>
<p>Since it's said to be the "site of the incident," it's unavoidable.</p>
<p>Every household hangs two flags, which may look nice, but they flutter weakly in the wind, seeming extraordinarily powerless.</p>
<p>Some people inside are preparing to move, and the roofs and walls of the white factory buildings are being demolished to make way for a road. Today is the first day they agreed to move, but the surveillance is still very strict, probably to prevent any mishaps.</p>
<p>An old woman, with a quilt tucked under her arm, comes out, looking very thin and pale. She looks at the two flags hanging on every household, shakes her head, and sighs, "Alas..."!</p>
<p>Walking out of the lane, heading east!</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>Huo Sang then briefly told Ni Jinshou about the two facts he had gathered: that Li Zhiban had gone out, and that I had learned about this from Old Mao and Jin Mei. He also included the shoe we had found in the upstairs room. He then said: "When I arrived here, I saw He Sheng still at the corner across the street, but Song Quan was already gone. By the time I heard the gunshot and came out, He Sheng was also gone. I think these two men are very capable and won't mess things up."</p>
<p>I then realized that the man in black I saw on the corner of Datong Road when I arrived here must have been a plainclothes detective specially assigned to keep watch here. Although I didn't know this man, he was probably named He Sheng. He Sheng had probably followed Zhao Boxiong. It was only later that I learned that it was Huo Sang who proposed the dispatch of this plainclothes detective. After completing the inspection of the Wang residence that morning, Huo Sang told Ni Jinshou to withdraw the No. 99 police officer, while also quietly telling him to send two secret agents, which had a subtle effect.</p>
<p>Huo Sang then said to Ni Jinshou: "You'd better send two more people here. There might be other changes."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and went back into the house to make a phone call. Huo Sang and I remained outside the door. I took the opportunity to ask: "Huo Sang, what did you find on Li Zhiban? It seemed like two pieces of paper. Right?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang nodded: "Yes, they were both receipts from the post office: one was a express mail receipt, and the other was a money order receipt." After he finished speaking, he turned around and headed west. His car was parked on the west side of the open space.</p>
<p>By the time he had opened the car door, Ni Jinshou had also come out of the house. Huo Sang beckoned to him, and the three of us got into the car together.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou asked: "Where are we going?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang replied: "To the police station. I want to wait for news from He Sheng and Song Quan."</p>
<p>During the car ride, everyone remained silent. As the case progressed step by step, it rose higher and higher. Although the peak was in sight, it was still obscured by a thin layer of clouds, and the face of the highest peak was still unclear. Furthermore, like climbing a mountain, after ascending nine-tenths of a winding path, the final effort might actually be more difficult than before. I believe the three of us felt the same way, so everyone tacitly kept silent. (153)</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Shaoxing Seven-County Native Place Association Over the Past Thirty Years <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yuzhai</p>
<p>It is my understanding that our Shaoxing Seven-County Native Place Association has been established for thirty years. Recalling the hardships of the pioneers who founded it, and looking forward to the great responsibilities of the future, we who live in this era and face these difficulties have an unshirkable duty to honor our ancestors and benefit our descendants. Therefore, this thirtieth anniversary celebration has a profound meaning.</p>
<p>Collective life begins with connection, and only through connection can there be unity. With unity, emotions will flourish. Our association has nearly 10,000 members, making it one of the three largest native place organizations in this city. Its strength is considerable, but it is still inferior to other native place organizations. Why is that? The people of Shaoxing are known for their hard work and frugality, which are indeed their strengths, but their closed-mindedness is also a flaw. They only know how to follow old ways and seek temporary peace, without thinking about improvement. Who knows that all things change with the great wheels of the times? What is considered an excellent idea or expression today may not be suitable for tomorrow. Moreover, in these times of global strife and increasingly complex social problems, the world is changing in unpredictable ways, and we must examine our environment, be practical, and strive not to become stragglers of the times. Otherwise, we will go against the current of society and face great danger.</p>
<p>Yuzhai is not talented, but you, gentlemen, have mistakenly entrusted me with the responsibility of preparing for the conference. I am ashamed of my inadequacy, and my strength is not equal to my ambition. Moreover, the smoke of war in my hometown has not yet dissipated, and the hungry are dying along the road. What is there to commemorate? However, as a fellow traveler from our hometown in Shanghai, I dare not refuse. In my opinion, this conference is primarily about connection, and I deeply hope that our fellow travelers in Shanghai will come enthusiastically. I also hope that all members will express their grand opinions on matters concerning the improvement of the association. If they are feasible, they will be adopted, so that we can gather our wisdom and open up new paths. With this belief, and with love for our hometown expressed in our words, we can flourish together.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our association has always been eager to establish education, and we have already established four primary and secondary schools, which we can be proud of. However, we still lack facilities for the treatment of illnesses among our fellow villagers, which is a regret. At this conference, under the leadership of Mr. Pei Yunqing, we decided to urgently prepare for the construction of the Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital, which is also one of our priorities. However, this is a major undertaking that cannot be accomplished without 300,000 yuan. Yuzhai is willing to follow in their footsteps to promote its success, and I hope that we, the people of Shaoxing, can work together to achieve it.</p>

<p>— Sent by Cheng Zhizheng from Los Angeles</p>
<p>Soon, I saw a road sign that said I could go to Oriental Park from here. Following the signs, I found a Chinese-style palace on the mountaintop. After buying a ticket, I was led on a tour by a host. It turned out that the owner of this garden had previously done business in China and Japan, and later returned to the United States, collecting many oriental artifacts and treasures. As a result, he spent more than one million US dollars to build a completely oriental-style garden. The houses were mostly in the Chinese style, the gardens in the Japanese style. After touring for half an hour, I seemed to have forgotten that I was still in Hollywood!</p>
<p>The reporter visited the Fox Company's film studio and saw countless sets placed on the square. Many of the grand palaces, large hotels, and desert rivers we see on the screen are mostly fake. The large plane in the recent film "Foreign Correspondent" is actually just a large model, traveling through the air using radio waves, and after being enlarged, it looks no different from the real thing. The reporter saw this small plane with his own eyes, and it is said that it cost four thousand US dollars!</p>
<p>The residences of the big stars are located in the Beverly Hills area of the Vire Mountain. Huge buildings are connected to the clouds, and they are extremely luxurious. Movie stars' incomes are always around two or three thousand US dollars per week, so they can be considered the darlings of heaven. If tourists want to see stars in Hollywood, the only way is to wait in front of the theaters where the premiere ceremonies are held. That night, the reporter happened to be in Hollywood, and "Foreign Correspondent" was being premiered that night. The colored searchlights in front of the theater flashed into the sky, making the night scene even more fiery. Many stars were invited to participate that night, so grandstands were built on both sides of the theater, and the people were so crowded that those who came later had to stand on the road. The reporter was limited by time and had no intention of waiting!</p>
<p>After a whole day, I had almost completely toured the whole town of Hollywood. On the way back to Los Angeles in the evening, I looked at the radiant light of Hollywood from afar, fully displaying the heroic posture of the capital of the film kingdom. When will I come back for another tour? I was fantasizing.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Lu Fulan Discussion (Part 2) <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Weiwei</p>
<p>Fulan is good because he received instruction from an accomplished master, underwent rigorous discipline, and put in hard work. Consequently, his foundation is superior to that of ordinary people. Because of his solid foundation, his strengths naturally arise from it. For example, when performing the pheasant feather dance, one can see his skill with the pheasant feathers; when performing the armored warrior plays, one can see his skill in wearing the armor; when performing the short-fighting plays, one can see his skill in wearing the belt. Although these are minor details, they are impossible to achieve without a substantial foundation. It can also be said that Fulan's only outstanding quality lies in the word "beauty." His movements are clean and crisp, his postures and stances are aesthetically pleasing, and every gesture is graceful. His footwork clearly shows his training. Every time one sees him leave the stage, he moves swiftly like the wind, without the slightest disarray, and his steps are in perfect sync with the drum beats, truly a spectacle to behold. In addition, Fulan can adhere to established rules and does not deviate from the original prototype, which is also commendable. Furthermore, his enunciation is also excellent, and he has a deep understanding of Kunqu melodies. Fulan is capable of performing all the melodies of martial arts plays, which is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Deficiencies　It is preferable for martial arts actors to be tall and large, but Fulan is short in stature, which is one of his deficiencies. Because of his short stature, his performance in armored warrior plays lacks power, and his performance in painted-face roles lacks imposingness. This is his second deficiency. His nearsightedness has a negative impact on his performances, which is his third deficiency. His voice is thin and narrow, lacking resonance, which is his fourth deficiency.</p>
<p>Masterpieces　Most martial arts actors today follow either the Yang (Xiaolou) or Shang (Heyu) schools. Those who follow the Yang school invariably consider plays such as "The Linked Rings," "Evil Tiger Village," and "Changban Slope" as their masterpieces, while those who learn from Shang consider plays such as "Heroic Righteousness," "Battle of Chuzhou," and "Battle of Siping Mountain" as their masterpieces. Fulan has more masterpieces than any other martial arts actor, and many of them are plays that others do not excel in. His most famous plays include "Battle of Puyang," "The Eight Great Hammers," "Flower Picking," "Night Flight," and "Centipede Ridge," which can be called unparalleled at the time. Other plays such as "Picking the Sliding Cart," "Attacking Zidu," "Unicorn Pavilion," as well as "Gathering of Heroes," "Meeting at Lin Kou," and "The Odd Meeting," which are young male roles, are also beyond the reach of ordinary performers.</p>
<p>Conclusion　Comparing Lu Fulan's strengths and weaknesses, we should recognize Fulan as a rare talent in martial arts acting, as his strengths are not possessed by the average person. In other words, there is no martial arts actor today who possesses Fulan's strengths. As for Fulan's weaknesses, such as his short stature and nearsightedness, they are inherent and not due to human effort, and there is room for sympathy. If someone were to ask me who is better, Fulan or Sun Yukun? We can make a side-by-side observation of the plays they have performed. Although Fulan is not good at performing painted-face roles, his short-fighting plays, armored warrior plays, and young male martial arts plays are far broader than what Yukun can achieve. Yukun, on the other hand, excels at performing painted-face roles and is better at performing armored warrior plays, but he cannot perform young male martial arts plays and does not often perform short-fighting plays. From this, we can determine the measure of the two men.</p>
<h3 id="e137">"Rebirth" to be screened in Shanghai <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After much anticipation and longing from ten thousand people, Warner Brothers' special mega-film, "Rebirth," premiered simultaneously yesterday at the Nanjing and Cathay Theaters. The film tells the story of a sensational event in Paris in 1847. It stars the extraordinary performers Bette Davis and Charles Boyer, and is not only poignant and moving, but also deeply touching, leaving a lasting impression on the heart. It is truly the biggest film of 1940. The film is 15,000 feet long and takes two and a half hours to screen. It is reported that the theaters have changed the screening times as follows: matinee shows at 2:15 and 5:30, and one evening show at 9:00.</p>
<p>A Fine Tale of Yue Opera</p>
<h3 id="e138">Yuan Xuefen Has a Bodhisattva's Heart <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Dashu</p>
<p>— Performing "Guanyin Attaining Enlightenment" to Aid Starving People</p>
<p>Since Yue opera became popular in Shanghai, two famous actors have emerged, both performing at the Great Coming Theater: the young male actor Ma Zhanghua and the female lead Yuan Xuefen. Although both came from Shanxi and belonged to the same troupe, and often performed in the same play, their worldly fates and experiences are different, just like their innate natures. Ma gained the favor of a wealthy woman from Ningbo, who hired him as her son and daughter-in-law with a generous dowry. Yuan Xuefen, although younger than Ma, being only nineteen years old, is serene, refined, and deeply elegant. Among actors, she is a rare find in terms of character. Her acting is truly profoundly depicted and delicately fitting, sometimes solemn and dignified, sometimes romantic and dashing. Who knew that after her performances, she had two years. Therefore, she performs plays that benefit the world and people's hearts, and her performances are true to life. Whether it is Liu Xiangnu or Guanyin Attaining Enlightenment, the theater is always full. Women in the audience, seeing her, often shed tears and share tears of sympathy, change their ways for the better, and deepen their thoughts of filial piety. Recently, rice prices have been high, and the livelihood of the poor has become increasingly difficult. In the streets and alleys, starving people are everywhere. A certain charity association, feeling compassion, distributes free meals every month to help the poor. Many people benefit from this, and the long-term operation requires a large sum of money. Yuan, who is also a member of the association, seeing that the good deed cannot be interrupted and that fundraising cannot be delayed, voluntarily decided to perform free charity performances, without makeup, without applying powder, with long sleeves covering her arms, and a cloth robe covering her body, completely different from her appearance on stage. As a female actor, and a female lead, her actions are like this, and people secretly suspect that it is unlike her, but they do not know that Yuan's father, named Songmao, made a living by teaching reading, and had family learning from himself. Therefore, she is like hemp growing in a field of hemp, standing out from the crowd. Xuefen loved watching Yue opera when she was young. At the age of twelve, she followed a teacher to learn opera. Because of her meticulous performance, excellent singing and acting, and demeanor of a master, she was praised by the literati in Yuezhong. After traveling to Ningbo and Hangzhou, she traveled to Shanghai, where she won widespread praise and became famous in her time. She once received guidance from famous people, saw through the world of mortals, and resolved to observe a long vegetarian fast for two days, using the proceeds to provide free meals and winter relief. Therefore, it was decided to borrow the Renewal Stage on the 4th and 5th of November to perform the complete version of "Guanyin Attaining Enlightenment" for two days. This play is Yuan's masterpiece, and everyone who has seen it praises it. However, it is truly commendable and valuable for a female actor to be so enthusiastic about charitable causes and generous in social relief efforts. Therefore, great Buddhist laymen in Shanghai, such as Wen Lantings Huang Hanzhi, Guan Wangzhi, Feng Yangshan, Zhu Qichen, and women in the women's community such as Ms. Li Qiujun, are happy to sponsor it. There is no shortage of benevolent gentlemen in the world, and Yuan's actions will surely gain the sympathy of many people, provide great assistance, and achieve satisfactory results, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Record of Different Names for the Same Play (3) <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Yuchu</p>
<p>"The Changing Meeting" - A frivolous comedy about wives and concubines competing for love and jealousy. Also known as "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband" and "Wives and Concubines Fighting for Favor."</p>
<p>"Battle of Changsha" - Also known as "Taking Changsha" or "Capturing Huang Zhong."</p>
<p>"Mulberry Garden Meeting" - Also known as "Sunflower Valley." Tells the story of Qiu Hu testing his wife's chastity with a gold horseshoe. Hence the names "Qiu Hu Teasing His Wife" and "The Gold Horseshoe."</p>
<p>"Imperial Stele Pavilion" - Also known as "Wang Youdao Divorcing His Wife" or "Joy of the Golden List."</p>
<p>"Splitting the Coffin" - Tells the story of Zhuangzi transforming into a butterfly to test his wife. Hence the names "Butterfly Dream" and "Zhuangzi Fanning the Grave."</p>
<p>"Shooting the Halberd at the Gate" - There is also a play called "Taking Little Pei," both using Lu Bu's resolving the conflict between Liu Bei and Ji Ling as the subject matter. The plot is the same, but the scenes are slightly different. Some say that the play without Guan Gong appearing on stage is called "Shooting the Halberd at the Gate." The one with Guan Gong is called "Taking Little Pei." Others say that the former stars a young male actor, while the latter stars a painted-face actor. Still others say that the reason why Guan Gong does not appear in "Shooting the Halberd" is because Ji Ling has red face paint, and Guan Gong also has a red face. It is not very pleasing to see the two of them on the same stage. Moreover, Guan Gong does not occupy an important position in this play, so he does not appear.</p>

<h3 id="e140">New Arts Company Stages New Play <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Ruiqing</p>
<p>The New Arts Company initially decided to publicly perform "Hero of the Seas" for two weeks, and although they suffered slight losses due to "natural disasters and human misfortunes," the actors' compatibility and the fact that many audience members braved the rain to come gave them great excitement. Therefore, now that they have had a slight breather, they are preparing for a second public performance. There are two plays planned: one is "The Assassination of Jing Ke" and the other is "The Fragrant Concubine." The former is written by Wei Ruhui and will be directed by Fei Mu, and "Jingchai" will be played by Ying Yin. However, Ying Yin is currently in collaboration with the public to film "Sai Jinhua," so the rehearsals will have to wait until after the film is finished. "The Fragrant Concubine" is written and directed by Zhu Shilin, and Wang Xichun plays the Fragrant Concubine – they are the original cast of the movie "The Fragrant Concubine," so adapting it for the stage should be easy for them.</p>
