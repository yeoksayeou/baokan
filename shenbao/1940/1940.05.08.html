<p>社評</p>
<h3>廢止五九紀念的意義</h3>
<p>昨日五七，明日五九。在二十年前，日本向中國要索二十一條，遽於五七送達哀的美敦、限於五九正式答覆；這是每一中國人所能記憶的史實。五九的成為國恥紀念日，先由社會自動、後由政府規定；但吾們以為東亞新秩序較二十一條為酷、武力侵略較哀的美敦為酷，而抗戰是歷史的翻案；故發動抗戰之後，對於所謂五九國恥，在觀念上自然改變了。本報爰於去年五九加以評述結論如次：</p>
<p>「……所謂東亞新秩序，其實正就是二十一條約延續和擴大，二十四年來日本侵略中國的史的敎訓，血的敎訓，終於喚醒了中國四萬五千萬的人民；而今日中國的抗戰，是代替了五九，對於五七二十一所作的正面答覆。換言之，在過去，中國社會以怨憤，以眼淚來紀念五九，到現在，中國軍民以壯烈，以鐵血來註銷五九。」</p>
<p>這是平凡的見解，却可自信其準確，據美國合衆社昨傳重慶電訉，略謂：</p>
<p>「政府今日決定將五九國恥紀念日廢止。按五九紀念原為使民衆記憶日人有侵略中國之野心，今自一九三七年七月七日起，全國均在抗戰，並定七月七日為抗戰紀念日，則五九之紀念，已無存在之必要。」</p>
<p>所由値得申論的、任何國家民族的紀念日，必有其莊嚴宏遠的意義：每逢紀念日，必須體念其意義，必恭必敬、舉行隆重的典禮儀式。中國近年正在存亡續絕之交、複雜錯綜之曾，故各種紀念日比較他國族他時代特別多；且待大局安定，當然需要一番審慎釐訂。而現在決定廢止五九國恥紀念日，却因正在抗戰、五九是抗戰前後的一節目，自不必為了這一節目而單獨紀念、所以儘先及時決定了。</p>
<p>這一次中國政肘決定廢止五九國恥紀念日、雖曰恰合平凡見解、但仍有進一步追求其動凶的必要。從消極方面說：這次決定，在性質上，不僅是一種法定紀念日的存廢，亦不僅是一種行政範圍內的政令；在意義上、當然不是吾定五九之為國恥，更不是　天後世以無恥。若冉曲解之為消弭嫌隙，捐棄讐恨，則尤悖謬之至；因中國民族性雖仁厚中肩，雖以程　解怨爲一般美德、爲傳統敎化，但目前正是敵愾同仇，實行明恥敎戰的大時代：要非侵略國家悔禍改圖、停戰撤兵、中國貫澈了主權領土完整的仁厚中庸的素願，則嫌隙讐恨根本談小上捐棄消弭。或可反問，在抗戰中途，發揚士氣、激勵民心、其方式，其機會，不厭其多；以五九所供給資料的豐富、則何妨姑且繼續保留這一紀念日，正是發揚激勵的最好方式、最好機會，又伺必多此一廢？誠然，問之成理；是須追求這次決定的積極動因。</p>
<p>關於中日問題，在日本以及日本的方面、自始便有種種詭辯，種種自欺欺人之談；到近頃、尤見其盛。舉其著者：如謂日本進攻中國、因為中國人不但不了解日本的王道，并且排日，遂致激怒了日本，使日本不得不以其威武。臀懲中國；又如謂中國人本不願抗日，亦無抗日必要，祗為國際某種勢力所挾持，遂事抗日，使日本不得不代中國人來淸除抗日者；又如謂日本並未侵略中國，至少亦今後不再侵略中國了，而中國至今以侵略寃了日本、故不再寃他而應謀和。諸如此類，亦儼然成為交響的論據。當然，任何人祇要訴之天理良心，便得判斷諸說之謬之妄、更無待逐字逐句的加以駁斥。却不妨簡單的分析這類論據：他們割裂了歷史抹煞了事理；在暴力抬頭的階段，用此歪曲論據來裝璜侵略的進行；在暴力落沒的階段，用此歪曲論據來掩護侵略的進行。吾們祗須從頭檢視二十五年前五七日本哀的美敦所包封的二十一條起，一直檢視數年來乃至於最近，日本在軍事政治經濟外交種種方面所作所為為止；一可見日本的侵略自昔迄今是一貫的野心，二可見中國排日抗日自始迄今是日本逼成的、三可見五九祗是中間的節目，亦猶中國軍隊克復五原、反攻南昌，亦僅是中間節目。倘若容許割裂歷史、容許抹煞事理，而以一節目為一事件、則日方歪曲論據大可成立，且可以詰貨中國何以攫取五原、侵犯南昌了！惟歷史不容割裂、事理不容抹煞，故歪曲論據祗是自暴其為歪曲；而中國政府的決定廢止五九國恥紀念日、即以宣明二十五年前日本的哀的美敦以迄今日中國的全面抗戰、實是整個的一問題。史實是鐵案、不容種種詭辯、不容種種欺人自欺之談！</p>
<h3>張伯倫在英下院　詳細報告挪戰局　解釋軍事挪延原因　國際反響不如初料嚴重</h3>
<p>倫敦　本日首相張伯倫在下院陳述挪威戰情之經過情形、首相張伯倫宣稱、上星期四日余曾聲明祇能發表不完全之戰事情形、、並將於本週繼續有所陳述、屆時余希望能發表詳盡之報吿、余又曾宣言不得不守相當緘默以免透露任何足以致吾軍於危險之言論、自此以後、各議員皆知吾軍雖已由安達爾斯納撤退、但仍須繼續退出南索斯、余對此甚至較撤退安達爾斯納更為危險之軍事、極不願作任何之暗示、　此項軍事撤離之人數更多、及德轟炸機全部將有飛臨之可能也、</p>
<p>首相　嘉讚英　陸軍在一短日中吿成撤退任務、而未受任何損失之非常幹能（衆歡呼）、謂翌日侵晨、德方發覺英軍正在返艦、乃遺出森炸機五十架、從事阻撓此事亦足徵明英軍所冒之危險　、此項運輸、實處於吾人戰鬥機飛程之外、故全頓艦上高射砲以禦敵自衛、而吾方除喪失英驅逐艦阿非里狄號法驅逐艦比松號外、未受其他損失、足稱幸事、今時南索斯與安達爾　納之軍隊均復開回、挪威南部之戰事已吿終止、軍隊之實行其任務、勇武異常、（衆人歡呼）已使英軍傳統之榮譽續有增加彼等之苦戰、堅忍與敏捷機警之行動、處優勢敵軍與優勢配備之壓迫下、已表明其以　對人而論實卓越於敵軍矣、余尙須作一言以欽仰王家海軍與空軍、彼　連續實行艱危之任務、而有偉大之成績、</p>
<p>南挪撤軍　無甚損失</p>
<p>余今不擬陳述挪威南部戰事之經過情形、唯願說明戰局之眞相、而考慮政府行動所引起之醬議、吾軍之撤退消息無疑的已造成本院與全國之深切震動、（有人高呼「海外與全世界皆然」）諾閣員所行之一切、自不免遭受責難、但有瑞典京城傳來之消息、或出於敵方之揑造者、已引起若干料將發生之事、此則旣無正當之理由、而亦未由任伺閣員表示同意也、</p>
<p>首相發言至此、有反對黨議員加以阻擾常由議長嚴厲判止、首相遂得賡續官稱、政府雖竭力撲滅此類無稽謠傳、惟一方面須加審愼、傳勿發表任何以眞相資敵之言論、余深恐在此項環境之下、震動　失望均在所不免、余今將檢討此次失收之歷史及原因、並答覆浩干問題、余固不願作任何　飾、但同時希望吾人對於所遭挫折之影響或軍要、勿作過分之誇張、南挪之退出不能與當年撤退格里波里之役相提並論、並無大軍在內、事實上人數僅超過一師、故吾方之損失為數不大、亦無任何甚大　量之軍需品遺留後方、首相又力言吾人如有損失、則德方軍艦飛機運輸艦及兵士方面之損失、實遠較吾人為重大、（歡呼聲作）、雖然如此、余仍知最近事件之結束、不能僅就當地之損失加以測量、（全院　高呼一靜聽靜聽）吾人必須思及威望受相當損失之事實、致德人在陸地上無敵之虛偽傳說愈見生色、各友邦為之氣沮、敵人大形得意、吾人目前對於此種情形必須予以接受、但吾人無須幫助敵人使之更趨惡劣、</p>
<p>外國反響　未見嚴重</p>
<p>關於各外國之反響、余意尙不及預料中之嚴重、法國在此艱難之時期中、始終表現顯著之鎭定，（歡呼聲）並與本國情形相同、挫敗之唯一影響即愈堅其決心是也、吾人之同盟國家土耳其、亦繼　毫不驚擾、埃及續事增强其防務、近東局勢已因地中海中吾人艦隊支配之恢復平日狀態、日趨平靜矣、君等必嘗預料瑞典之反響、其嚴重甚於任何各處、余固深　其理由之所在、余所所抱憾者、瑞典報紙載有　爭論之性質評論、　瑞典之表示失望、或為理所常然、而此種評淪旣無裨於瑞典、復無益於協約國之生義也、吾人今所關切者、非在反唇相稽、此在每一方面均善為之、（大呼「聽之聽之一）而在將來所當取之大概計畫、如瑞典朝野決議在壓迫之下取中立政策、則余必信賴此種中立至少對交戰國雙方將嚴格公尤也、（聽之聽之）</p>
<p>援挪行動　出於冒險</p>
<p>首相繼乃述及此後之事變、及內閣歷次之決議曰、當吾人決議出師至那維克時、余未聞人何訾議、共地乃　瑞典寳貴鐵砂礦達北海之鬥戶也、余敢料此項決議定受大衆所贊同、但或有欲問吾人必己早知特降漢之敵軍佔有天空之優勢、而奧斯陸之敵軍復有趕速馳往之可能、曷　仍遺遠征軍開往該區者、余不欲僞稱在最初危念之數日中、吾人已料及一切、但吾人固明知遠征軍之出發、實充滿危險、吾人且知苟非能遏制敵援、則奪取特隆漢而扼守之、為功殊艱、吾人並知特隆漢飛機塲之便利、不經修　與擴張、不敷供吾人飛機之活動、但吾人又不得不考慮若不企圖佔取挪威中部、挪威政府軍隊、人民將因以所受之影響、吾人曾接威挪軍總司令至緊急之一再呼　、謂官不恤任何代價、進攻特隆漢、吾人至是明了苟非吾人攻擊特隆漢、則挪人似將感覺其力不能賡續抵抗、而全國必落於德人手中矣、吾人處此情勢、乃覺事雖艱危、但必須冒險援助勇敢之民族、彼等幾已遺忘戰爭之為何物、悍然挺起、以抗德軍、冀得保全彼等之自由與獨立、試問本院諸君易地而處、其將不如是作為乎、余覺苟吾人拒絕挪威之呼籲、則吾人必已受責言、謂吾人惟一目的、乃在斯堪的那維亞之鐵砂、而絕不關心小國之自由、吾人對此、必無以置辯也、</p>
<p>未毀公路　認爲失策</p>
<p>余今將陳述吾人須對特隆漢作直接攻擊之原因、專家對於此點或有不同之意見、雖將有値得尊軍之意見、但戰事旣未經試騐、則欲作最後決定、將永不可能矣、吾人旣決定主張、乃審愼考慮而製定直攻特隆漢與南索斯安達爾斯納兩地戰事同時並進之計畫、此役當然頭緒錯粽、欲保勝利必需長時間作貫澈之準備、再、在某一時間似覺攻佔特隆漢或可僅藉在各處登陸之軍隊吿成之、吾人常以為由奧斯陸通至兩流域之公路經挪人破壞、娘炸毀橋梁、德軍之前進或將延遲、但此節殊使吾人失望、蓋除由英兵炸毀二橋外、絕未予以破壞、於是德軍乃得挾坦克車砲隊迫擊砲疾進、以遏制吾軍、繼乃迫令撤退、</p>
<p>德軍在挪　奸謀逞志</p>
<p>余今將涉及外間廣傳及許多機關報所載之責言、即前為援助芬蘭調集之軍隊不應予以分散、若長加保留、則吾人可以先發制人、估據挪威各港、或至少可以更多之軍隊更速馳抵戰區是　要知吾人縱能調遣軍隊、苟非經挪政府許可開往、吾人終小能在德軍之前有何舉動、謂吾人應在德軍之前攻入挪威、余敢料任何人必不以為然也、所不幸者、挪政府堅決保守極嚴格之中立、挪政府直至無可奈何、始許吾軍開入其口岸、故吾人實無法阻止德軍之打擊、彼等藉挪威內部之好謀、施之甚易、且在事前久經準備、其軍隊與戰品顯皆藏於偽飾之商船、假使堅持因分散英法聯軍而吾人失去在德軍施擊後獲取勝利機會之爭論、則余敢謂此種爭論實以完全之妄想為根據也、</p>
<p>英法遠征　軍之布置</p>
<p>首相繼續說明事實之直相云、編成央法遠征軍之隊伍計分兩部、一部為先遺部隊、本擬派往芬蘭、另一部人數較多、擬於第一批到達斯堪的那維亞後繼續開拔、此第二批爲主力部隊、迨芬蘭戰事告終、吾人決定無在本國留駐此項大軍之必要故即將主力部隊調往法國、而留先遺部隊駐於此間、下院須知因本國境內無軍隊可調、致對於挪威不能調遺更大之軍隊、惟有出發迅速、始能在可供吾人利用之極小數海港登陸、故各議員將能明　在此種佈置之下、第一批先遣部隊在挪威獲得據點之後、由法國開拔之軍隊自將繼之開往、決無遲延、事實上此項主力部隊雖遠在法國、但祗須能得有據點、無論如何、不致有任何遲延情形發生、故分散英法聯軍之該部外、實未失去時間、蓋無論如何、此軍必不致偕先遺部隊開出、如先遺部隊獲得據點、則此軍自能儘速繼之以往也（七日路透電）（未完）</p>
<h3>英法內閣　地位動搖　挪戰已獲得教訓　綏靖主義足誤國</h3>
<p>倫教　上下兩院定於本日分別開會、辯論政府在挪威國戰爭中所推行之政策、上院方面決　哈里法克斯外相代表政府發言、各觀察家對於此次辯論、極為重視、咸謂哈里法克斯外相素孚衆望、平時在上議院中、尤為各議員所愛戴、即反對派工黨各議員、亦從未加以抨擊、因此張伯倫首和他日若果去職，則哈里法克斯最有繼任首相之可能、此公雖為勛爵、但按之憲法、上下兩院若均不表異議、他日出任首相之後、仍能出席下議院參加辯論也、總之、本日上議院中、即使不舉行何項投票政府地位即使不生動搖、但當此一般民衆渴望戰事進人新階段之際、究竟國內政局傾向如何、必可由本日辯論情形中、見其端倪云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據今晨若干報紙關於本日下院辯論之　述、謂此次挪威戰事中所得之敎訓、即為協約國對於敵人可畏之力量未能予以認識、及不澈底之手段將不能使彼　獲得勝利、「每日電聞報載稱、首相張　倫今日在下院起立發言時、將自知現在危險中之問題、實遠過所發言論主題之範圍、由嚴格之軍事立塲而言、挪境之挫敗、並不足以危及吾人最後之勝利、其眞正之重大意義、實在其與精力、先見。及效率之關係、因進行戰事端賴此　項要素也、吾人顯確知吾人現正眞正聚集力量作最後決勝之攻擊、更有甚於此者、即吾人必須能打破外界之疑團、因與否人外交有重大關係之各中立國態度、大事皆親吾人之力量及前途爲斷、吾人之道德方面，尙屬其次要　也、　切期待之世界將研究全國對於政府處置之反響、其縝密將不殊其本身之事件云、「每日郵報」云、今日之辯綸、將甚為廣泛、人民皆欲知將如何　擊敗德國、目前政府必須有急　之發動云、「新聞紀事報亦載稱、吾人迄今祇進行一半之戰事、因吾人係藉多餘之時間、以多餘之資源作戰、目下吾人必須終止此項危險之愚蠢行動、而開始進行一種全部之戰爭云、「每日民聲報」則對於張伯倫之是否適宜統治、表示懊疑、（七日路透軍）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間民衆及官塲方面均殷待今日英下院之辯論結果、衆料對於法政府之地位、將有反響、「自主　」載稱、「英相張伯倫深日慕尼黑之概念、請問萊諾、君　希望張氏將輕易加以放　乎二秩　報載　、張伯倫應知綏靖主義與誤國、二者為一、德政府早已迅速　知協約國對挪威之決定、係屬事實云、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>虞氏意見</p>
<p>日來外匯變動關係、各業紛紛提高售價、而對於日用生活必需之各項物品、高漲尤烈、中上以下民衆、莫不深感苦痛、而一般薪工階級、更覺有度日如年之槪、新聲社記者、昨特往訪本埠商業領袖虞洽卿氏、探詢意見、承虞氏延見、並發表談話如次、虞氏謂、日來本市各項物價、無不飛漲、其所持理由、皆謂外匯變動、其實並非事實、即使外匯　動、其首蒙影響者、當然為舶來物品、舶來物品、以最迅速計算、到滬應市</p>
<p>為期三月</p>
<p>換言之、至少三月後到貨、方受外匯縮價之影響、則現在門市售出之各項貨物、胥　存貨、焉有即行增價之理、即如本月二日外匯發生變動、當日上午、即有一律增價三成者、可為荒唐已極、此實藉外匯變動為名、以牟非分之利耳、焉可為事理之平、至食米與煤球兩項、近亦隨同上漲、更不應該、按此兩項、為平民日用必需品、所關尤鉅、現在</p>
<p>先談煤球</p>
<p>查月前市商會邀集煤業、一再磋商平價、原定煤屑之價、為每噸一百元、核計水脚每噸二十八先令、約虧五先令之譜、現時水脚减至每噸二十三先令、正合每噸一百元、不至虧耗、煤球廠製造各費、每噸約十五六元、加餘利四五元、作每噸二十元計算、再加門市煤炭店代售、餘利每噸四五元、車力每噸一二元、共合每噸一百二十六元、即每担六元三角、即使受外匯影響、至多亦不過將煤屑成本、加二十元、合計每噸亦不過一百四十六元、何來每噸一百九十元之鉅價、而况外匯變動、</p>

<h3>林語堂在菲談話　美信中國必勝　美如禁運必置日於絕境　中國民眾結亘古未見</h3>
<p>中國著名英語文學作家林語堂氏、偕其夫人及三女、由美返國、以迎中國軍事之最後勝利、道出馬尼刺時、向記老發表談話、盛　美國公意、希望中國勝利、而中國之能力、亦必能獲取最後勝利、而驅逐侵略者、林氏抵香港後、小住若干日、即將飛重慶久居、茲將其談話錄後、</p>
<p>美人確信　中國必勝</p>
<p>中日發生戰事、美國民衆情緒、傾向華方、而與情匪特認中國有戰勝之均等機會、且必獲最後勝利、過去半年來、美人所抱中國終必戰勝之感覺、已告滋長、獲見美人同情中國抗戰、且信中國力能擊敗侵略者、極爲欣慰、</p>
<p>日兵在華　手足無措</p>
<p>日本外交人員之言、已無人能置信、因其所言、非毫無誠意、即與日軍所行相左、事後不得不由外交人員爲之强辯、欲蓋彌彰、惟日人在中國前綫、深感手足無措、已不能影饗遠東以外之發展、</p>
<p>美國態度　已轉強硬</p>
<p>美國對日態度、已轉强硬、目執有可能的禁運利器、足制日本於死地、故日人深以美國宣布對日禁運之後果爲懼、日本在人力上、已臻枯竭之點、士氣民氣、日形衰頹、而準備金耗用殆盡、中國則有無窮人力、貿易進行如常、且民衆團結之堅決、爲中國有史以來所未見、</p>
<p>一切陰謀　均告失敗</p>
<p>日軍在華冒險、每月死傷約四萬人、此即日軍不敢復窺重慶之故、日方刻圖鞏固其所佔之中國領土、亦吿失敗、謀扶植傀儡、以鞏固侵佔區域、然傀儡終屬傀儡、結果日本不得不一再加派士兵入侵佔區、最近有一傀儡甚至不得上海華人商界之擁護</p>

<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、以晨間匯兌狂縮六分之鉅、本市美匯遂掛緊一二五、爲四元三七五、英匯未更、其他各匯亦一致微軟、內盤情况、續見穩定、惟因匯兌猛跌、致成英硬美軟之態、全日過程曲折尙少、初以港電供塞兼日行亦向市求售、潛勢一度頗鬆、先令最硬曾達二辦士三四三七五、午刻投機商猛結、復告回軟、至後市況尙平、下午投機商仍來搜購、時賴美行源源售出、供求相抵、市象極穩、迄收　亦無變化、結果英金三辦士二一二五、美匯四元六八七五、較上日英長〇三一二五、美反緊〇六二五、期貨與現貨、稍見軋攏、</p>
<p>再就紐約對外匯兌、以爲觀察、六日電訊、英鎊價格大　、賣風甚熾、尤以來自遠東者爲甚、香港美滙乃亦動盪不定、而紐約對滬法幣行市、則已由四元七角五分、回漲至四元八角、此後國際間匯兌趨勢、亦殊堪注意者也、</p>
<p>日行塞出美匯</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美勿動、對滬長一二五、對法未更、美對英縮六分二五、對滬大五分、對法降三分半、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士二八一二五、美匯四元六五六二五、較之隔昨晚收、英平美緊〇九三七五、乃匯兌猛落之故、開後不久港電來吐售、價遂起鬆、計港電賣予外行現貨英金三辦士三一二五、至現貨美匯外行曾對做爲四元六八七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英匯不變、美匯微緊一二五、爲四元三七五、白銀平衡稅揭曉無上落、嗣後因日行亦塞出、且外行吃胃殊淡、滿懷供意、致市面鬆勢較速、五月份美匯日行吐出四元四三七五、時聞現貨英金最硬見三辦士三四三七五、美匯四元七五、又五月美滙投機商賣予外行達四元半、午刻投機商忽起扒風、市面回軟、結果收盤英金三辦士二八一二五、美匯四元六五六二五、俱與晨開相同、而期貨與現貨稍形軋</p>
<p>美商供給亦勁</p>
<p>午後雖華商投機家頻來結納、而因美行等供塞頗勁、市况始終穩定、曾做開交易計有五月份美匯、投機家吸進自四元四三七五、以至四元半，晚收尙見硬化、結果英金三辦士三一二五、美匯四元六八七五、本月份英金三辦土一五六二五、美匯四元四三七五、較隔昨晚收現貨英微長〇三一二五、美反緊〇六二五、本月份英鬆〇六二五、美則吿平、</p>
<p>香港美匯不定</p>
<p>香港七月（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤市面尙吿穩定、惟美匯動盪不定、英匯現期貨均站原盤、美滙現貨縮三七五、爲廿一元〇六二五、遠期未曾開出、申匯現貨降二元、爲四百四十元、日滙現貨跟緊二元、爲八十九元五角、十一時〇五分平穩、申匯現貨升二元、爲四百四十二元、十一時二十分微軟、美匯現貨緊一二五、爲二十元九三七五、午收吿平、申匯現貨續升三元、爲四百四十五元、</p>
<p>天津英美又縮</p>
<p>天津七日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤呆滯、英匯現貨緊〇七八一二五、爲二便士八五九三七五、美匯現貨縮二五、爲四元正、申匯升七角五分、爲一百十三元七角五分、</p>
<h3>金市徘徊　未脫漲勢</h3>
<p>昨現金赤給暗盤市况、以人心俱堅、上漲氣氛仍厚、雖升後又跌、結果續趨上游、晨開即好十一元、繼金號首入、一時賣方甚缺、遂抬至七千一百元、嗣因外匯報鬆、難免引起浮戶脫手、證券錢兌業力售、致被撳進七千元關內、最低吿六千九百七十元、迨至十一時光景、匯市復軟、某金號及證券帮競相扒購、檯面於買氣籠罩下、衝出七千一百元、見七千一百四十元高價、惟午收祇七千〇八十元、後市初昂、金號搜買未稍後人、不意爲證券帮曁金號等多頭出籠所壓、降達七千〇二十五元、收盤前銀號帮撈進若干、結果尙吿七千〇六十元、較上日又漲五十元、全天交易先旺後淸、的做開三千餘兩、銀樓飾金先跌旋即回平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>赤漲五十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開滙兌雖吿猛跌、但本市美滙緊後甫即回鬆、故開時賣者尙有、祇略抬十元、銀號出銀樓帮十兩、爲七千〇二十元、嗣因金號見低搜買、立漲八十元、銀號出證券帮二十兩、爲七千一百元、但照上價限價賣戶頗多、漲勞被阻、某錢兌業忽來傾吐、立轉向下、且不久某證券帮及金號等跟踪力塞、而外匯斯時仍報走鬆、買者　落、竟退入七千元大關、證券帮出金號廿兩、遜爲六千九百七十元、此後賣戶漸减、金號稍吸、市勢轉穩、立回出七千元大關、不意十一時許突起漲風、金號及另一證券帮競扒、而外匯轉緊、散戶見景搶買、霎時間竟飛漲百餘元、金號進錢兌業十兩、爲七千一百四十元、午刻買風稍戢、金號復賣、回落六十元、金號出銀號廿兩、爲七千〇八十元作午收價、午後開時、人心頗佳、開高四十元、銀號進金號十兩、爲七千一百二十元、後某金號塞出頓回小四十元、金號出錢兌業十兩、爲七千〇八十元、旋銀號再來收買、重見提高二十元、金號進證劵帮二十兩、爲七千一百元、第因午刻力扒之某證券帮、及某金號多頭忽來復塞、且匯市報硬、缺少買戶、復回落七十五元、錢兌業出銀號二十兩、爲七千〇二十五元、入後銀號見賤撈入、重再向上、金號互做三十兩、爲七千〇六十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲五十元、查已連漲七天、共一千四百八十八元、全天一百七十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十餘元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金欲跌又止</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸七百二七元、迨至十時三刻、掛小十元、十一時半回升十元、此後無變化、結果平平、大同行依然懸七百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>貼現稍低</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率稍小、每千元上午由一百八十元步低至一百五十元、午刻一百六十元左右、下午略高至一百七十元、比上日續跌五元、錢業公會拆息仍勿更、早午兩市均掛二角</p>
<h3>外幣升降不一</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊仍不乏需要、市價一致續漲一元、英金票晨間供求均勻、午後以黑市英滙趨鬆、故終於下落一元、美金票始以鎊價暴落六分二五、晨初高至二十一元七八角、嗣又步退至二十元〇九角、午收爲二十一元二角、午後情勢甚穩、晚市爲二十一元一角、結果與上日無分軒輊、香港票晨間頗有需要、市價略漲、午後漸次回平、法郞票稍有需求、價漲一分、安南票忽有供給、市勢趨下、羅比票同業稍有需要、市便略漲、坎拿大票回落五角、日金票趨勢略堅、晚市爲一元二角七分七厘、朝鮮票父需要、晚市退爲九角九分五厘、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股交易熱鬧　內債進出不多</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况仍係盤旋帶疲狀况、交易亦依然不振、各戶隨時陸續不斷仍有現貨流出、買戶萎靡、零星補空爲多、國內戰事優持、國外則漸起變化、公僓隨時均受打擊、前途殊難樂觀、多方以吃息太重、頗多顧忌、更以外滙套息利息優厚、都捨此而取彼、故更見冷淡、昨日買賣仍係賣戶多而買戶少、或則進丙出丁、以下抽籤後之羨餘、或則進丁出丙、以圖中籤之僥倖、各有所求、已溢出平日投機之本位、變化之來、當尙在後、市價結果、除甲種不動外、餘則略小五分一角至二角、成交總數的計五六十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大生第三股三十股、價爲三十元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤、雖無賣方壓力、潛勢則略帶軟、多種價格概較前收稍低、最初一小時內、似有續跌之象、後因人心回堅、價格得以支持、雖成交不惡、活躍似已稍减、買方興趣亦無特注之點、足資記叙、地產業股票中、中和股需求最殷、價自開盤時之二十二元半、猛跳至二十四元七五收盤、此價購者猶未壓足、業廣股相反的跌落數角、收盤十六元七角、前收則爲十七元二角、上海企業股之成交有二萬九千五百股、其受人愛戴若是、價格猶自開盤時八元三角半買進、低至收盤時之八元賣出、英聯股餘榮未盡、成交四萬四千四百股、開盤價爲七十三元買進、七十三元半賣出、一度跌至七十元五角低價、嗣又回復至七十二元收盤、</p>
<p>橡皮股價雖跌、需求者尙不乏人、蘭格志在回風中最受影響、價自開盤時之四十七元跌至四十五元半買進、七角半賣出、英楂華亦落兩元、橡皮信託則退去七八角、各股俱有買方興趣維繫、故情况不能謂爲欠佳也、</p>
<p>倫敦六日（週一）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、善後借款英發倩票跌落一鎊半、價爲三十三鎊半、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦六日（週一）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛脾行市、古拉客林傍橡皮股回跌三便士、爲十八先令三便士、其餘均無變動、</p>
<h3>上海企業發新股</h3>
<p>英商上海企業有限公司股份總額爲一百萬股、每股國幣五元、資本總額爲國幣五百萬元、除已發股份三十七萬股、計國幣一百八十五萬元外、現經董事會議決、由未發行股份六十三萬股項下、提出五十五萬五千股、繼續發行、每股發行價格爲國幣五元五角、規定老股二股、可認購新股一三一股、限於五月十五日以前向滙豐銀行繳足股額、凡屬五月十日註册之股東、均有申睛認股之權利云、</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭已在吐出　紗市轉形緩和　實銷亦難望發展</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼回、趨勢稍形和緩、但人心依然看好者居多數、所以市價一鬆、買戶則接踵而來、至於實銷一層、大批交易甚爲缺乏、惟香港帶零星採辦、續而不斷也、</p>
<p>現現紗晨開因上日午後人氣良好、市勢續進、二十支雙馬廠單價爲一千七百零五元、旋聞外滙稍長、而金價平靜、多方又復吐出、市情較爲鬆懈、跌至一千六百八十元、收盤以後、稍見回上、查半日間成交統計一千七百九十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十二元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行一、〇七〇香港五五〇內地　一二五南漢　三〇寗波　一五統計一、七九〇</p>
<h3>棉市起色</h3>
<p>本本棉交易已露氣色之象、華廠稍有需要、故人心堅定、同行交易依然熱鬧如恒、所以行情穩固、茲將現棉成交情形列左、大中集　二〇〇·〇〇新裕進一〇〇包平果爾一二六·〇〇同行進三〇〇件下河打三三·〇〇榮豐進二一八件大中集三〇〇·〇〇同行進九〇件皮拉二八〇·〇〇同行進二〇〇件彭家浦三〇二·五〇同行進五〇件郵包花三三三、〇〇新生進一八四包米特林　三五〇、〇〇　三四〇·〇〇誠孚進六四件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日因受各方賣出壓力之所致、續後又因南方之套賣及多頭之了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日近期跌十磅音、遠期跌十四五磅音、印度昨日連同預測跌三羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日又轉形活躍、天津帮購意頗濃、某廠昨日亦略有進胃、因之同業頗感興奮、事實目前市上存底微薄、且售價較洋行方面廉去三四十元不等、但恐數日後、現貨仍有追及期貨售價之趨勢也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙四元六二五折合送廠價如下、二十支美米特林三七四·五〇二十支又下級三〇六·二〇三十二支又三九九·七〇三十二支又下級三八五·〇四十二支又四〇二·六〇四十二支又下級三九八·二〇</p>
<h3>糧食　米價略平　—價格已告—</h3>
<p>米市昨依然平疲、蓋　來市面變化太烈、買方不敢貿然買進、晨間初開銷塲殊淡賣風驟盛、都以小絞爲皮球生意在喊聲步低之間、節節下游近元、開四十八元五角、詎料此價方出、一般浮國散戶即復拉進、頃刻互　附和、喊聲迭起、霎回一元、小絞復至四十九元半、奈實銷有限、半係心思交易、終難保守、還貶半元、斯後一路徘徊、常出入於此價左右、卒以四十九元收盤、他如西貢暹羅等貨、以實銷爲多、尙較平穩、終市僅有半元上落、獨碎米與米菉供求頗勻、售價相仿無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、傳聞塲外晤盤、遂亦不振、無錫淸特粳已開五十一元五十元、粉坯四十九元、靑泗薄稻及南港早晚稻悉爲高自四十九元二角、决至四十八元云云、糯米雖爲時令應需品、然銷路不廣、且以棧貨擁擠、致令貨賤則卑、不以價廉而能支持、並見墮落元奇、售金溧特元四十二元半、四十二元、常丹高元四十一元四角、次至潮軟者三十八九元耳、</p>
<p>洋洋米因外滙漸平、投機者興味漸淡、獲利多頭競相售出、市價隨難堅站、現米尤以暹羅爲疲、因明日九日尙有一船二千八百噸到埠、人心甚盧、例如二號暹遲早市開價四十九元、午後跌到四十七元五六角尙乏受主、稍次者祇開四十七元一角、較小一元半以上、二號西貢小絞　下午收市均比早市小元外、惟原包回籠二號西貢貨主堅持甚力、跌勢較緩、五月上期原根結價仍開六十元、市上則開五十九元三五角、已到自五十九元二角至五十八元七角、全日開出四白多噸、現貨六千多包、</p>
<h3>麵銷南洋　本街麵坊請求平價　粉廠猶謂不敷成本</h3>
<p>昨日粉市定中帶堅、查二號粉廠盤仍爲十四元、客盤則尙有十五元之高價、蓋緣通日南洋幫粉銷忽動、由某方在滬採辦、米麵均有裝運、是以人心較好、回籠貨老車牌價比廠盤見高二三角、執持者依然視爲奇貨、內地粉亦然、故目下各粉號零售每包由十四元二角至四角不等、聞機器切麵業正在呈請要求抑平粉價、據廠方消息、則以原料高貴、其本街批價尙屬維持性質、惟前昨米價業已回降、若照四包粉一石米價計算、則粉價已較米價爲高矣、又聞內地粉本銷不弱、如順風牌等昨開十四元三角、比前日又硬五分、麥市因廠欲抑價、依然擯持、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅銷令已屆</h3>
<p>昨日油餅市况背道分馳、豆油供求不埒、續跌元外、花生油市價漲跌不一、惟豆餅銷塲方興未艾、欣欣向榮、人心頗活潑、行情頻見上騰、昨各餅再提二三四角、計與化帮辦去大有餘廠四脾餅二千片、價爲十一元七角、內地團胃分去常州元隆餅七車（每車六百二十片）價爲十元零八角、汕頭帮問津烟台餅二千片、價爲十元零二角、　　四牌餅一萬五千餘片、價爲十元零八角零七角半云、</p>
<p>又黃豆昨（七日）有二百包由靑島運來父豆油六九十件、</p>
<h3>糖市　刁青漲五元</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢轉平、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧貨七十六元七角、外棧新貨七十六元七角至七十六元半、老貨七十六元三角至二角、轉口貨六十元、太古車白Ｂ嘜四八十七元、大的八十六元半、可以入手、荷赤本棧六十六元七角、轉口五十五元半、Ｈ嘜車赤六十三元、餘乏更動、國糖刁靑昨有成交三百外包、價爲六十二元至六十二元七角、比前（二日）漲五元許、條靑數十件、仍五十二元、聞興化靑四七十元、以相去過多、米</p>
<h3>南北貨　金蔡亦遭統制　行市焉得便宜</h3>
<p>金針菜向以滙劃交易、最近貼水曾超出二百元關外、雖目前略見回平、然來源方面更須受某方市塲統制、故外費突增、成本更昂、刻下銷路亦轉活潑、勢頗堅挺、據產訊、本年新貨劃申非五十元不可、故人心一致看好、查前日廣帮辦頂莊菜一批爲五十五元、而連日號貨亦開漲至鉅、計中興宿遷七十餘包、四十八元、大興菜五十二元、高鄉莊五十三元半、前後須漲十元云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　新茶開盤</h3>
<p>近兩日來製銷洋莊之新綠茶、各廠家已有一二十字新樣展佈上市、昨先後共由協和始和錦隆等行、收進珍屑百餘箱、價做開四百三十元至四百六十元、照商家來路成本估計、均不免虧折、形勢頗爲小利、聞各行最近辦進之新陳各貨、大部份均係交裝意國郵船康脫羅索號出口、値此地中海戰雲彌漫之秋、中外茶商、多抱觀望態度，</p>

<h3>大中學生聯誼會　告全滬同學書</h3>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>第二、要以抗戰建國綱領、來作爲我們刻苦奮鬥的</p>
<p>唯一目標</p>
<p>讀書固然是我們的本位工作、但是我們刻苦奮鬥、也得有一定的目標所依歸、吾則我們就容易受誘惑而動搖、和一味盲從的危險、我們知道中國現在只有抗戰到底才是唯一的出路、我們當然反對任何和平妥協約主張、不過長期抗戰、實在是一個極艱苦卓絕的工作、因爲這次的抗戰、我們的目的、不僅僅在抵抗日本的侵略、我們一方面從事抗戰、一方面還要積極建國、建立一個自由平等的新國家、所以抗戰與建國是同時並進的、我們要達到抗戰必勝建國必成的目的、第一就得堅强我們的自尊心和自信心、靑年是國家的棟樑、我們尤其應該堅强我們的、</p>
<p>抗戰信念</p>
<p>領導民衆參加抗戰建國的工作、不過前面已說過了、我們用功讀書就是救國、這個意思、就是說我們學生必須從事本位工作的救國、換句話說、我們要做適當的課外活動、我們必須做民衆的表率、對於國家要抱一種絕對樂觀的態度、我們必須認淸目標、長期抗戰的目的是要建立一個獨立自由的三民主義的新中國、中途妥協就是自取滅亡、所以我們反對投降式的欺騙民衆的和平、我們必須肅淸自己隊伍中的少數動搖份子、當然我們還希望他們有最後的覺悟、能够棄邪歸正、一致來參加抗戰建國的工作、我們必須認淸這次抗戰、是中華民族爭取獨立自由平等的</p>
<p>唯一途經</p>
<p>這救亡的責任必須每個人自己擔負起來、這次蔣委員長在國民參政會第五次大會中也明白昭吿我們、「我們兩年來無論抗戰環境如何艱舌、但抗戰國策始終堅定、抗戰國策所以能够如此堅定、」就是因爲全國人民始終一貫的擁護抗戰建國綱領、我們學生過去是有最光榮的歷史、所以臨到這樣偉大的節日、我們不能不互相勉勵、最要緊的、我們必須明判是非、辯別邪正、</p>

<h3>迎春禮（二）</h3>
<p>春官向以乞丐爲之，無人肯充此苦差。芒神先前有玻璃燈脾一對，接以金字藍紗燈牌數對，後隨侯從數十人，皆各衙之差役，鑼鼓響處，　喝連聲，末則香烟繚繞，提爐與香盤等，對舉齊行，最後則塗金朱漆神亭一座，蓋太歲至焉。亭前設燭架三四層，燃燭徧揷，緣神前燃過之燭，俗爲之元寳，人爭購巨燭易歸，稱爲大吉利。一時購買不及者，爭投以錢，或數十文，或百數文，或數千文不等，向神前拔燭而去，其所過之店戶，則另有人以殘燭分送，謂之送元寳，其價則勝燭數倍也。迎春衆官，首爲理事分府敎事，下至旗鑼繖扇刑杖籤筒之屬，無不具紅黑帽，執鞭辟道者，的十餘人。房科書吏與負册負印等吏，皆衣冠整齊，乘馬緩轡而過。末則虎皮交椅，四人高抬，則爲分府之公座焉。决爲水利分府，再次爲總捕分府，其儀亦如之。三分府後，則仁錢兩縣尊踵至，縣署中差役執事人等，旣多倍蓰，而儀仗鮮明，尤爲其出色處也。</p>

<h3>做世界的人（四）</h3>
<p>又如某富人，在家為好家長，好隣屆，但一到辦公室，則態度大變，狡如狐狸，虛如猛虎，因此，凡與他競爭的人，都稱他為「無良的人。」豈眞無良心嗎？他的良心只在私，不在公罷了。又如立法者，利用職務上的便利，　訂種種於地方有利的法條，不就全國利　着想，像此等人，都需要一顆寬大以國家為重的良心。但國家主義，失于　狹，如非法侵略他國，也非國家和世界之福。所以，他們也得進一步有世界的良心，不顧語言，種族國界之別，為全人類謀幸福。（三）一種世界的工作，人人應當作工。但為什麼工作呢？為生活嗎？不是。若只為生活，牛馬也優為之。為家庭嗎？不是，如只為家庭，虎狼也轉於愛護其族類。為國家嗎？不是，如以為國家，與不信基督的希臘人何別？基督徒的理想是，人必須為人道—世界作工。他必須這樣做人，使其日常工作，與促進世界進化的工作銜接　氣。他是負有使命的人，他的使命，就是喂養，醫治，敎育，和救贖世界。古來為人道作工的有美國的林肯主張釋放黑奴，有衛斯理李芬斯唐等，布道國外；有戈登將軍，以義俠為懷，為他國犧牲了生命，此外，舉不勝舉，他們都是為世界人道作工的人。總起來說，有此三重品格者為誰，就是加利利人耶穌。他鞠躬盡瘁為人類的需要，為世界的改造，犧甡了性命，他是我們做人的好模範。完如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<p>大衆呼聲</p>
<h3>同歸於盡</h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>眞是越弄越不像樣了；十兩的烚赤會做到七千多元；美多票折合國幣郤要二十多　；一些人囤米，煤；另一些人囤紗花，布匹；不論什麼貨色都給貼上封皮，往堆　裏送！據說，「目前價錢不曾漲足，不賣！」</p>
<p>也有拿出一點來賣的，但是他們的標價　你看了不得不搖頭。工部局禁止擅抬物價的告示似乎絲亳影響都沒有。</p>
<p>實在都想擠盡大衆的血汗！雖然心裏很明白大衆購買力的日趨薄弱。儘管發「眼前財」，得擠且擠！</p>
<p>有的已給擠得變為赤身跣足，甚至於變為餓殍的；有的已給擠得差不多了，不得已腆　地跑回到在淪陷區域的故鄕去的；那些都是懦弱之流。但也有强悍的，不甘心子株守，為「求生存」而走險的。不見數日來報載的社會新聞吧？</p>
<p>不論其手段的是否正當，「要吃飯」郤是一般的企求。到那時，失去了發財的對象時，也正是不能讓你一個人捧着金飯碗寫寫意意吃飯的時候！</p>
<p>那時候，即使囤着金條美金，也是同歸於盡！</p>
<h3>救救大家（大衆呼聲之二）</h3>
<p>— 或人</p>
<p>我是一個洋行小職員，月薪五十六元，在戰前，維持三口之家（妻兒各一）的生活，也不見怎樣寒酸了。但是戰後的生活程度，幾乎漲上了四五倍，雖然同人數度要求，資方已加薪一成半，及另加生活津貼十元（合計七十四元四角），可是要維持這個小家庭，即使對付食住兩項，也是很可憐的了</p>
<p>因為戰前十二元的亭子間，現在已經加到十八元了；米與伙食每月也至少在三十元以上；其他煤球，油鹽醬醋，那一樣不是海到了可怕的程度；而更其在這次漲風中，「坐以待斃」確實不是誇張的一句話了。</p>
<p>自然退一步想，像我這樣有如許收入的，在這大都市的比例中，大槪也能列入中中的等級吧？那末，在這失業狂潮中，也該平心靜氣，耐苦耐勞，度過這個艱苦的關頭；可是我們現在的吃苦，並不直接受於抗戰影響，這是不容掩飾的，站在一條船上的人而顧不到全體的安全，這就使我們不得不起來大聲疾呼了。同時，也正是我們是中中等級，其他列下最下層的更叫他們如何度日呢？</p>
<p>有一個故事告訴我們：</p>
<p>當大水淹沒某村的時候，有兄弟二人各自搬了家中的所有，駕着二艘小船逃命。在途中，哥哥覺得弟弟船上的東西多於自己拿的，兩人爭執起來，哥哥就暗中施計把弟弟擊暈了投入水中，把弟弟船上東西搬了過來。可是那艘小船，裝載過重，一個浪潮擊來的時候，沉沒了，哥哥自然也淹死在水裏。</p>
<p>生活在「孤島」上的中國同胞，正如某村的兄弟一般，我們應該把二艘小船緊緊繫在一起，抵禦當前的浪潮！否則，這故事的兌現也是遲早問題罷了。</p>
<p>救救大家！也是救自已！</p>
<h3>四川物價近况</h3>
<p>— 華健</p>
<p>頃接四川自流井友人來函，附錄川省物價槪况，轉錄於後：</p>
<p>米　每斗十元　藍洋布每尺一元四角</p>
<p>煤炭每斤五六分　白竹布每尺一元五六角</p>
<p>豬油每斤一元二角　洗面巾每塊二元餘</p>
<p>菜油每斤一元一角　蔴紗機每變七八元</p>
<p>鷄　每只三元餘　縐紗　每尺三四元</p>
<p>鴨　每只二元餘　綢緞　每尺三四元</p>
<p>魚　每兩一角餘　絲綿　每斤七八元</p>
<p>肉　每斤六角半　棉花　每斤五六元</p>
<p>蛋　每個五六分直貢呢鞋子每雙十二元</p>
<p>白糖每斤一元四角</p>
<p>鹽　每斤四角</p>
<p>豆腐每槐四分</p>
<p>由上用地物價概況，可知四川物價，絕非一味狂漲，其中豬油，菜油，鷄，鴨等，價格與滬彷彿，蓋非專賴外來物品也。若蛋，肉，鹽等，較滬為賤，因乃本地土產。而藍洋布，白竹布，蔴紗襪，縐紗等，則因全靠上海或香港等地運往，故較為稍貴，與上海之面積　奇不同也。外來物品也。若蛋，肉，鹽等，較滬為賤，因乃本地土產。而藍洋布，白竹布，蔴紗機，縐紗等，則因全靠上海或香港等地運往，故較為稍貴，與上海之囤積　奇不同也。</p>
<h3>窮骨頭撑不住了</h3>
<p>— 金川</p>
<p>大衆呼聲之三</p>
<p>金子漲了了外匯縮了，市儈們於是又趁火打刦，刀上舐血，生活的担子又加重一倍，使我幾根窮骨頭難以持支了！呼天天不應，入地地無門。米入了五十元，煤球出了九元關，日用品時漲日增，也無從統計，都拉開了嘴，照碼三成五成，而我們的肚子不可一日不進貨，然生活如此的高昂，仰不可攀，我又沒有點金的法術，科至還　到丸劑可以代食的時候，而幾根窮骨頭縱然是鋼，鋼也會斷折；血即使是自來水，而自來水也會乾竭，到了這種骨斷血枯的局面，窮人們都成了餓殍，市儈們的肚子漲成如墳墓，裝了這許多窮骨頭，固然可以發十萬二十萬的財，但說不定過了些時，漲破了肚皮，同歸於盡，一旁高興而得利的還是他人，我實為之寒心！</p>
<p>孔子曰「苛政猛於虎！」現在是生活猛於虎了！虎可避，生活的担子不可避！</p>
<p>市儈們，稍發些天良，救救幾十萬同胞免成餓殍，不然，祗有都在你面前等死！但你能快活幾時呢？</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿三回　舊侶新儔文章有價　名區勝地管領得人</p>
<p>所以為了不許湖山生疥，那種風景佳勝之區，絕對禁止建築私人墳墓。即使是非風景之區，墳墓占地，也有一定限制。因為士地是使你生產的，中國復興以後，正要辦到野無游民，地無曠土，却被那些陳死人佔據了許多土地去，太沒意思了。好在中國現在到處都有了公墓，一槐公墓地，便可以葬不少的人。而且火葬的風氣，也漸漸地開了。再講到廣告，風景之區，更是絕對的禁止。譬如像從前，每遇一個風景最優勝的地方，靑山隱隱，碧水迢迢，憑閣暢懷，登樓遠眺，偏偏有一個大廣告牌，遮斷你的視線，你想惹厭不惹厭。不用說淋病目疾，畫着赤裸醜態的女子，繪着翹起菱角鬍子的武人，一見了使人起不快之感。便是商業上正當的廣告，也不許安置任風景之區。廣告牌並非是不許豎，你要使多人觸目，在市集上規定的地方儘可以去設立，何心來蹧蹋那些風景呢，不但是不許建墳墓，不許張廣告，便是私人的住宅別墅之類，也所禁止。除非你這建築物是公開的，無論何人，都可以游覽的，那就算屬於公有的了。現在這電頭渚雖然建築了不少亭毫樓閣，也都是屬於公有的。薛工程師夫婦請客的地方，喚作水雲樓，是　座新造的樓，是太湖水泥公司籌資建造，歸於　方上所有的。登樓一望，風景却是非常的美麗。一回兒工夫，金澹雲新夫婦陪着許多人都來了。這其間？有許多人都到過無錫那個鼇頭渚來的，只有蘇理雅太太以及何家兩位小姐却是初次來到這裏。薛工程師夫婦招待殷勤，金澹雲與薛夫人初次見面，更為款洽。他們今天所辦的菜，名為中菜西吃。怎麼叫做中菜西吃呢？原來所有食物的材料，都是中國貨，而燒法也是中國燒法，不過餐具也備着西式的刀又。他們知道今天有蘇理雅太太在內，她是用不慣中國筷子的。其實却不知道蘇　雅太太久已中國化，她常用中國筷子吃飯，不比初到中國的歐美人，握着筷子，不得勁兒。餚饌額可以各客分開，但燒是併在一起的。中國的烹調精華，就是併在一起，好像一個國家似的，宜於統一，不宜於割據。（二七三）</p>

<h3>英國人對好萊塢的鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>喬治、亞理斯（GeorgeArliss）是好萊塢影城中一個很聞名的英籍明星，最近，他在美國「現代史料」上發表了一篇「好萊塢—在一個英國人的眼光中」的文章，把從影十年以來的生活，與好萊塢的景况寫得非常詳細，活潑動人，趣味盎然，後面就是原文的節譯</p>
<p>「我所住過的幾個城市之中，當推好萊塢最舒適。在街上走過的男男女女，大槪全是與影戲公司有關係的。一個明星，即使走在路上，也不會被人包圍，雖然也有陌生人突然跑上來問姓道好的事情。</p>
<p>「好萊塢給我的第一個印象就是大—望眼看去，全都是一個個小的村落。高聳的商店與飯店倒並不怎樣多……</p>
<p>「除了環繞在四周的山峰之外，好萊塢的全部美景，差不多都是用人工來造成的。</p>
<p>「我有一次遇到了一個名叫的瑟·傑佛遜的者名的舞臺演員。我間他年靑時演戲的興味如何，他就如此地吿訴了我：「那時的演戲眞苦呢；把一只肥皂箱子舖上一塊紅布，硬叫你坐在上面做一個皇帝，你想，這是多麽苦的一椿事呵？」但是到了目前，好萊塢一切的服飾，佈景，道具都像眞的一樣，雖然，你不高興當皇帝，可也自然而然地會神氣十足呢。</p>
<p>其次，喬治亞理斯又吿訴了我們許多妤萊塢的演員的苦處，他說：</p>
<p>「在攝影塲中，你不必一定要知道怎樣燒飯，怎樣做一個好妻子或一個母親，但必須要學習忍耐。如果是一個臨時演員的話，那你必須要在早上七點三十分到攝影塲的化裝室裏去預備你的第一個鏡頭，之後呢，就要等，等，或許會等到深夜仍舊　有開拍，到了明天，卻又要一早去那裏等候了。即使是一個紅明星，他（她）雖然可以晚一些兒來，但也免不掉等，往往化裝好了之後，要等到好久以後，才動手拍攝，在這一段時間裏，你想寫信吧，不可能，看看報紙吧，也不可能，那才眞累死人呢！」</p>
<p>最後，他還吿訴了我們：所謂賣座的鉅片，大槪在事實上都是好」的片子，而決不是粗製　造的，學他人樣的那些</p>
<p>亞理斯爲了想把他那一段從影的歷史永遠的留下的緣故，他還在寫一本名叫「我的從影十年」（My　Ten　Yearsat　the　Stndios）的書，不久將由美國立德兩、勃朗公司出版云。</p>
<h3>紀女馴獸家陳秀英　—會在香港主演片「野人王」</h3>
<p>— 遊記者</p>
<p>猛獸是可怕，但是把兇橫殘暴的獅虎要得像山貓白兎那麽馴服柔順，這在影片中可以看到，影片往往可以設法僞迭亂眞，然而，在馬戲團裏面，像陳秀英小姐的伏虎馴象的絕技，是活生生的在千萬觀衆面前演出了。</p>
<p>陳小姐是菲洲的華僑，今年二十一歲，自小即馬戲團混在一起，她從十一歲獻技到現在，已經有十年，從菲洲經東印度，到南洋各屬，在蓬帳生洋中，她和全團七十多個同伴流浪了近數百個碼頭，十幾個國家、因此，她除負有馴獸技術以外、還能說七種不同國家的方言。</p>
<p>四年前，她把祖國的國學得非常流利、而且參加過很多次為祖國各種義舉善事捐募了許多款項、在歐洲一帶的馬戲團裏面、她曾有過不少觀光揣摩的次數，特別是馴獅養虎，外國女子也不多見，在中國當然更不必說了。</p>
<p>她的體格相當健美，姿容也很秀麗，據她自己說，在香港的時候，她會爲一家影片公司拍了一張粵語野獸片「野人王一，許多影片公司爭先　她簽訂長期台同，但流浪成了習慣的帳幕生涯，對於她已經成了太深的愛好，她因捨戀不斷年的同伴，因此婉詞推謝了。</p>
<p>菲洲馬戲團這次來滬獻演，開幕時因水土關係，養息了一星期，現在聽說即將正式參加演出了。</p>
<h3>陳秀英的武裝</h3>
<p>— 超攝</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒　將退出銀幕</h3>
<p>本刊前載秀蘭鄧波兒，將退出銀幕而入學校之說，業已證實，蓋緣路透社好萊塢專電，已有此確實報吿也。秀蘭之母語人曰：余欲秀蘭忘却電影數年，渠工作良苦，今後應自享受矣云。按秀蘭鄧波兒從事銀幕工作今已七年，爲好萊塢薪級最優明星之一</p>
<h3>兩主角的　情</h3>
<h3>「愛慾之爭」前言</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>誰知道海蒂拉瑪的誘惑性，有着不可思議的魔力。過去的「慾燄」鉅片，她有大胆的演出與色情的挑撥，震駭了全世界的影迷。「愛慾之爭」是她到好萊塢的一部代表作品，米高梅公司也不惜一攝冉攝，非常鄭重的完成這部傑作。</p>
<p>她的近期作品，所講英語，脫不了她祖國的母音。可是「愛慾之爭」裏，她說得一口流利純粹的英語。這也許是奇蹟，她來到好萊塢，不過短暫的一年，就能够說得十分正確，不是她的特殊聰明，那裏有這樣成績。小但如此，就是表情與演出方面，也玲瓏剔透，無論面部綫條，眼風與動作，都有甚高的成就。</p>
<p>全部的情節無疑地打動每個人的心弦，尤其是女性的同情。海蒂拉瑪就是一個遭人遺棄的女子，她經受不過物慾與肉慾的壓迫，她自殺了。幸虧有個醫生救了她性命，在種種的遭遇上，她明白眞誠的愛的偉大，她拋棄在社會上的交際地位，毅然決然與這位醫生結婚，幹一番悲天憫人的工作。</p>
<p>扮演醫生的男明星，就是主演「兒童樂園」的史本塞屈賽。這位獲得藝術學院金像獎的大藝人，第一次上演愛情的鏡頭，就有深　的表演，可見多才多藝，無所不能。</p>
<p>導演是有名的范達克，他有念五年的舞台經騐，過去曾經做過導演巨頭舊雷菲斯的助手。像「人獸奇觀」「愛斯基摩一絕代艷后」聶兇大偵探」「河底沉槍」等名片，都是他一手導演，留下了崇高的口碑。</p>
<p>以上述三大藝人合作而成的「愛慾之爭」，至少可以說，滿意的欣賞是必然的事實，反正今天在大華開映，留持影迷自己去咀嚼吧！</p>

<h3>The Hua Army of Southern Henan Launches a Full-Scale Offensive, Completing the Encirclement of the Japanese Forces. Defeats Japanese Main Force in the Mi-Que and Tong-Xin Highway Area. Fierce Battles Along the Jing-Zhong Line in Central Hubei, with the Chinese Army Completing Annihilation Efforts.</h3>
<p>Nanyang: The Hua Army of Southern Henan, adapting to the battlefield situation and according to plan, launched a full-scale offensive on the morning of the 6th, in the area along the Mi-Que and Tong-Xin highways, encircling the main force of the advancing Japanese army. The details are as follows: From May 1st, the Hua Army, facing the Japanese advancing from the Yang Branch Road, followed the predetermined strategy, deploying a portion of their forces in the front to strike the Japanese in successive waves. After fierce fighting on the night of the 6th, the main force of the Japanese army was completely drawn into the Mi-Yang and Tong-Bai lines on the Hua front, preventing them from escaping. Simultaneously, the main force of the Hua Army gradually moved towards the outer flanks of the Japanese, completing the encirclement. Another unit, under a certain command, advanced along multiple routes towards the rear of the Japanese on the Ping-Han Railway, directly attacking the Japanese base and cutting off their retreat. By the night of the 6th, the intended encirclement had been completed. On the morning of the 7th, the encirclement and attack began. The Hua Army's deployment was thorough, and morale was high. The large army on the northern side of the Mi-Que Highway launched a fierce attack to the south, cutting off the Japanese forces on the Mi-Que road in successive waves. Simultaneously, the large armies on both sides of the Hua Tong-Xin Road, in coordination with the southward-moving forces, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the left flank and rear of the Japanese. By the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese forces on the Tong-Xin Road were immediately shaken. Furthermore, at noon on the 6th, the Hua Army on the front suddenly launched a fierce attack on the advancing Japanese, engaging in fierce battles in the vicinity of Mi-Yang and Tong-Bai. The Japanese, caught off guard by the sudden attack, were defeated after only three hours of fighting, leaving behind over 1,400 bodies. The remaining Japanese forces fled north in disarray. The Hua Army is pursuing them relentlessly, expanding the victory in coordination with the large armies on the two flanks. The Hua Army behind the Ping-Han Railway launched a counter-offensive operation around Xinyang and Minggang last night, achieving great success. In summary, the major battle in the Southern Henan region has, to date, resulted in the deaths of 5,300 Japanese soldiers, and even more astonishing developments are expected. (Dated 7th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese forces that emerged from Central Hubei were completely cut off in the rear along the Jing-Zhong Road by the Chinese army. From the night of the 5th, they were surrounded and attacked, with fierce battles taking place in the area around Majiaji (north of Zhongxiang) and Fashuigou (northwest of Zhongxiang). By noon on the 6th, the Japanese were completely defeated, abandoning bodies like mountains, totaling over 4,000. The remaining Japanese forces fled north. (Dated 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese forces in Northern Hubei, aided by airplanes and heavy artillery, continue to advance towards Xiangfan. It is reported that Japanese aircraft are heavily bombing Huafang Village and Bo Village in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan to disrupt the Chinese army's transportation in the area. The recent battle situation in the Han River流域is as follows: Japanese forces advancing north along the east bank of the Han River from Zhongxiang have reached Haozigang (a small village southeast of Xiangyang). Japanese forces advancing west from Suixian have reached Tangxian Town east of Zhaoyang, and Hengtang (transliteration) to the southeast. Japanese forces advancing west from Xinyang have reached Xiaolin Town (east of Tongbai). Another route of Japanese forces advancing west from the Ping-Han Railway towards Biyang has now reached Huanggang (a small village southeast of Biyang). (Reuters, Dated 7th)</p>
<p>Shashi: The Hua Army in the Jianli and Mianyang areas has completed preparations and, in coordination with the elite Hua forces, will launch a combined land and water offensive tonight, advancing towards certain key locations. (Dated 7th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese forces emerging from Suixian are being intercepted by the Hua Army in the mountainous area on both sides of the Sui-Zao Highway. The Hua Army has also dispatched several surprise units to advance into the rear of the Japanese forces on the Xiang-Hua Road, seeking an opportunity to launch an all-out attack. The Japanese are trapped in a situation where they cannot advance or retreat. (Dated 7th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Significance of Abolishing the May Ninth Commemoration</h3>
<p>Yesterday was May Seventh, tomorrow is May Ninth. Twenty years ago, Japan demanded Twenty-One Demands from China, delivering them to the ailing Medun on May Seventh and requiring a formal response by May Ninth. This is a historical fact that every Chinese person can remember. May Ninth became a national day of shame, first by social initiative and then by government decree. However, we believe that the New Order in East Asia is more cruel than the Twenty-One Demands, that armed invasion is more cruel than the ailing Medun, and that the War of Resistance is a reversal of history. Therefore, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the concept of the so-called National Shame of May Ninth naturally changed. This newspaper commented on and concluded last year's May Ninth as follows:</p>
<p>"...The so-called New Order in East Asia is actually a continuation and expansion of the Twenty-One Demands. The historical and bloody lessons of Japan's invasion of China over the past twenty-four years have finally awakened the 450 million people of China. Today, China's War of Resistance is a positive response to the Twenty-One Demands made on May Seventh, replacing the May Ninth commemoration. In other words, in the past, Chinese society commemorated May Ninth with resentment and tears. Now, Chinese soldiers and civilians are using heroic sacrifices and iron blood to cancel May Ninth."</p>
<p>This is a simple view, but it can be confidently considered accurate. According to a recent report from the United Press in Chongqing, it is briefly stated:</p>
<p>"The government today decided to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth. The original purpose of the May Ninth commemoration was to remind the public of the Japanese's ambitions to invade China. Now, since July 7, 1937, the entire country has been at war, and July 7 has been designated as the War of Resistance Commemoration Day. Therefore, the commemoration of May Ninth is no longer necessary."</p>
<p>What deserves further discussion is that any national holiday of any nation must have its solemn and profound significance. On every holiday, it is necessary to understand its meaning, be respectful, and hold grand ceremonies. China has been at a critical juncture of survival and continuation, with complex and intricate situations in recent years, so there are particularly many holidays compared to other nations and eras. It is necessary to make prudent revisions after the overall situation is stable. However, the decision to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth is because the country is at war and the May Ninth incident is a part of the War of Resistance. There is no need to commemorate this incident separately, so the decision has been made as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Although this decision by the Chinese government to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth seems to be consistent with our simple view, it is still necessary to further explore its underlying motives. From a negative perspective, this decision is not only about the existence or abolition of a legal holiday or simply a government order within an administrative scope. In its meaning, it is certainly not that we define May Ninth as a national shame, nor that future generations should be without shame. It would be even more absurd to misinterpret this as eliminating misunderstandings and abandoning hatred, because although the Chinese national character is benevolent and moderate, and although resolving grievances is generally considered a virtue and a traditional education, the current era is one of shared hatred and a clear emphasis on teaching about shame and fighting the enemy. Unless the invading country repents and changes its course, ceases hostilities and withdraws its troops, and China fulfills its inherent desire for sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no basis for discussing the abandonment or elimination of misunderstandings and hatred. One might ask, in the midst of the War of Resistance, there can never be enough ways and opportunities to promote morale and inspire the people. Given the wealth of information provided by May Ninth, why not simply continue to preserve this commemoration day, which is the best way and opportunity to promote and inspire? Why bother with this abolition? Indeed, this question is reasonable. We must seek the positive motives behind this decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, there have been various sophistries and self-deceptions from the beginning in Japan and on the Japanese side. These have become particularly prevalent recently. To name a few notable examples: Some say that Japan invaded China because the Chinese people not only failed to understand Japan's benevolent rule but also opposed Japan, which angered Japan, forcing it to use its military might to punish China. Others say that the Chinese people did not want to resist Japan and had no need to resist Japan, but were held hostage by certain international forces, which led to their resistance against Japan, forcing Japan to clear away the resisters on behalf of the Chinese people. Still others say that Japan has not invaded China, or at least will no longer invade China in the future, but China has been accusing Japan of aggression, so they should no longer accuse them and should seek peace. Such arguments have become a harmonious justification. Of course, anyone who appeals to reason and conscience can judge the fallacy and absurdity of these arguments without needing to refute them word by word. However, it is worthwhile to briefly analyze these arguments: They have dissected history and obscured facts. In the stage where violence is on the rise, they use these distorted arguments to embellish the invasion. In the stage where violence is declining, they use these distorted arguments to conceal the invasion. We only need to review the Twenty-One Demands that Japan enclosed in the Medun on May Seventh twenty-five years ago, and continue to review everything Japan has done in the military, political, economic, and diplomatic fields in recent years and even recently. First, we can see that Japan's aggression has been a consistent ambition from the past to the present. Second, we can see that China's opposition and resistance against Japan have been forced by Japan from beginning to end. Third, we can see that May Ninth is only an intermediate event, just as the Chinese army's recapture of Wuyuan and counterattack on Nanchang are only intermediate events. If we allow the dissection of history and the obscuring of facts, and treat an event as a single event, then the Japanese side's distorted arguments can be established, and they can even accuse China of seizing Wuyuan and invading Nanchang! However, history cannot be dissected, and facts cannot be obscured. Therefore, distorted arguments only expose themselves as distortions. The Chinese government's decision to abolish the National Shame Commemoration Day of May Ninth is to declare that Japan's Medun twenty-five years ago and China's full-scale War of Resistance today are all part of the same issue. Historical facts are ironclad evidence, and they do not allow for various sophistries or various self-deceptions!</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Detailed Report in the British House of Commons on the Norwegian War Situation; Explains the Reasons for Military Delay in Norway; International Reaction Not as Severe as Initially Expected</h3>
<p>London, [Date]: Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons on the Norwegian war situation. He stated that last Thursday, he had only been able to give an incomplete account of the war situation and would continue to report this week, hoping to provide a detailed report at that time. He also stated that he had to maintain considerable silence to avoid revealing anything that could endanger our forces. Since then, all members have known that our forces have retreated from Åndalsnes and must continue to retreat from Namsos. He was extremely unwilling to make any hints about this military operation, which was even more dangerous than the retreat from Åndalsnes. This military withdrawal involved a larger number of people, and there was the possibility of German bombers arriving at any time.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister praised the British Army for completing the withdrawal mission in a short period of time without suffering any losses (cheers). He said that the next morning, the Germans discovered that the British forces were returning to the ships and sent fifty bombers to obstruct them, which also proved the danger faced by the British forces. This transport was beyond the range of our fighter planes, so all the anti-aircraft guns on the ships had to defend themselves. Fortunately, we only lost the British destroyer HMS Afridi and the French destroyer Bison, which is fortunate. Now, the troops from Namsos and Åndalsnes have returned, and the war in southern Norway has ended. The troops carried out their mission with extraordinary bravery (cheers), which has further enhanced the traditional honor of the British Army. Their hard fighting, perseverance, and agile and alert actions, under the pressure of superior enemy forces and superior equipment, have shown that they are superior to the enemy in terms of their treatment of people. He also had to say a word to admire the Royal Navy and Air Force, who continuously carried out difficult and dangerous tasks with great success.</p>
<p>Little Loss in the Withdrawal from Southern Norway</p>
<p>He did not intend to describe the course of the war in southern Norway, but wished to explain the truth of the war situation and consider the discussions caused by the government's actions. The news of our military withdrawal undoubtedly caused deep shock in this House and across the country (someone shouted "overseas and worldwide"). Everything done by the cabinet members will inevitably be criticized, but news from the Swedish capital, or fabricated by the enemy, has aroused some things that are expected to happen. This has neither proper reason nor has it been agreed to by any cabinet member.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister spoke to this point, he was interrupted by opposition party members, who were strictly stopped by the Speaker. The Prime Minister was able to continue to state that although the government has tried its best to suppress such unfounded rumors, it must also be cautious on the one hand and not publish any remarks that would provide the enemy with truthful information. He was deeply afraid that under these circumstances, shocks and disappointments were inevitable. He will now review the history and causes of this failure and answer many questions. He certainly did not want to make any decorations, but at the same time hoped that we would not exaggerate the impact or military importance of the setbacks we have suffered. The withdrawal from southern Norway cannot be compared with the retreat from Gallipoli in those years. There were no large troops involved. In fact, the number was only slightly more than one division, so our losses were not great, and no large quantities of military supplies were left behind. The Prime Minister also emphasized that if we had losses, the losses of German warships, aircraft, transport ships, and soldiers were far greater than ours (cheers). Nevertheless, he still knew that the end of the recent events could not be measured solely in terms of local losses (the whole house shouted to listen carefully). We must consider the fact that prestige has been considerably damaged, making the false legend of the Germans being invincible on land even more vivid, causing allied nations to be discouraged, and the enemy to be greatly pleased. We must accept this situation at present, but we do not need to help the enemy make it worse.</p>
<p>Foreign Reactions Not Seen as Serious</p>
<p>Regarding the reactions of various foreign countries, he felt that they were not as serious as expected. France has always shown remarkable composure during this difficult period (cheers), and the situation is the same as in this country. The only impact of the setback is to strengthen its determination. Our allied nation, Turkey, also continued without any disturbance, and Egypt continued to strengthen its defenses. The situation in the Near East has gradually calmed down due to the restoration of the normal state of our fleet's dominance in the Mediterranean. You must have expected the reaction from Sweden to be more serious than anywhere else. He deeply understood the reason for this. He regretted that the Swedish newspapers carried controversial comments, and Sweden's expression of disappointment may be natural, but such comments neither benefit Sweden nor are beneficial to the righteousness of the Allied countries. What we are concerned about now is not to argue back, this is good in every way (shouting "listen, listen"), but the general plan to be taken in the future. If the Swedish government and people decide to take a neutral policy under pressure, then he must trust that this neutrality will at least be strictly fair to both belligerent parties (listen, listen).</p>
<p>The Aid to Norway Was Out of Risk</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then described the subsequent events and the various decisions of the cabinet, saying that when we decided to send troops to Narvik, he had not heard any criticism. The area is a gateway for Sweden's precious iron ore mines to reach the North Sea. He dared to predict that this decision would be approved by the public. But some may want to ask whether we already knew that the enemy troops in Trondheim had an advantage in the sky, and that the enemy troops in Oslo could rush there quickly, why still send an expeditionary force to that area. He did not want to pretend that in the first few days of the crisis, we had anticipated everything, but we certainly knew that the departure of the expeditionary force was full of danger. We also knew that if we could not contain the enemy's reinforcements, it would be very difficult to seize Trondheim and hold it. We also knew that the convenience of the Trondheim airfield, without repair and expansion, was not sufficient for the activities of our aircraft. But we also had to consider the impact on the Norwegian government, troops, and people if we did not attempt to occupy central Norway. We had received repeated and urgent calls from the commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army, saying that he would attack Trondheim at any cost. We were then clear that if we did not attack Trondheim, the Norwegians would feel that they could not continue to resist, and the whole country would fall into the hands of the Germans. In this situation, we felt that although the matter was difficult and dangerous, we had to risk helping the brave nation, who had almost forgotten what war was, to bravely rise up and resist the German army in the hope of preserving their freedom and independence. He asked, if the gentlemen of this House were in our position, would they not have acted in the same way? He felt that if we had refused Norway's call, we would have been blamed for only caring about the iron ore in Scandinavia and not caring about the freedom of small countries. We would have been unable to defend ourselves against this.</p>
<p>Failure to Destroy Highways Considered a Mistake</p>
<p>He will now state the reason why we had to make a direct attack on Trondheim. Experts may have different opinions on this point. Although there will be valuable military opinions, it will never be possible to make a final decision without testing the war. Since we decided to advocate, we carefully considered and formulated a plan for a direct attack on Trondheim and simultaneous operations in Namsos and Åndalsnes. This battle was naturally complicated, and a long time was needed to prepare thoroughly to ensure victory. Furthermore, at a certain time, it seemed that the occupation of Trondheim could only be achieved by troops landing in various places. We often thought that the highway from Oslo to the two river basins had been destroyed by the Norwegians, and the bridges had been blown up, which would delay the German army's advance, but this was very disappointing to us, because except for the two bridges blown up by the British troops, they were never destroyed. As a result, the German army was able to advance rapidly with tanks, artillery, and mortars to contain our army and then force it to retreat.</p>
<p>The Germans in Norway Schemed and Succeeded</p>
<p>He will now touch on the criticisms widely spread outside and in many newspapers, that the troops previously mobilized to help Finland should not have been dispersed. If they had been retained for a longer period of time, we could have preempted and occupied Norwegian ports, or at least more troops could have arrived in the theater of war more quickly. It must be known that even if we could have dispatched troops, we would not have been able to take any action before the German army without the permission of the Norwegian government. It has been said that we should have invaded Norway before the German army. He dared to predict that no one would have thought that was right. Unfortunately, the Norwegian government firmly maintained strict neutrality. The Norwegian government did not allow our troops to enter its ports until it had no choice. Therefore, we were unable to prevent the German attack. They easily succeeded by taking advantage of the schemers within Norway and had been preparing for a long time in advance. Their troops and war materials were obviously hidden in disguised merchant ships. If the argument is insisted that by dispersing the British and French Allied forces, we lost the opportunity to achieve victory after the German army attacked, then he dared to say that this argument is based entirely on fantasy.</p>
<p>The Deployment of the British and French Expeditionary Forces</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued to explain the truth of the matter, saying that the troops formed into the British and French expeditionary forces were divided into two parts. One part was the advance unit, which was originally intended to be sent to Finland. The other part, which was larger in number, was intended to continue to be dispatched after the first batch arrived in Scandinavia. This second batch was the main force. When the war in Finland ended, we decided that there was no need to keep this large army stationed in the country, so we immediately transferred the main force to France, and kept the advance unit stationed here. The House must know that because there were no troops to transfer within the country, a larger army could not be transferred to Norway. Only by departing quickly could they land in the very few seaports available to us. Therefore, the members will be able to clearly understand that under this arrangement, after the first batch of advance units gained a foothold in Norway, the troops dispatched from France would naturally follow them without delay. In fact, although this main force was far away in France, it would not be delayed in any way as long as it could gain a foothold. Therefore, the dispersal of this part of the British and French Allied forces did not lose time, because in any case, this army would not have left with the advance unit. If the advance unit gained a foothold, then this army could follow as quickly as possible (Reuters, 7th). (To be continued)</p>

<p>London, [Date]: Both the Upper and Lower Houses are scheduled to meet today to debate the government's policy in the Norwegian war. Observers attach great importance to this debate. It is said that Foreign Secretary Halifax is highly respected and is particularly loved by the members in the Upper House. Even the members of the opposition Labour Party have never attacked him. Therefore, if Chamberlain resigns one day, Halifax is the most likely successor to the Prime Minister. Although this gentleman is a lord, according to the constitution, if both the Upper and Lower Houses do not express objections, he can still attend the Lower House to participate in debates after he takes office as Prime Minister one day. In short, even if no vote is held in the Upper House today and the government's position is not shaken, the domestic political tendencies can be seen from the debate today, as the general public is eager for the war to enter a new stage (Havas, 7th).</p>
<p>London, [Date]: According to several newspapers this morning regarding the debate in the House of Commons today, the lesson learned from the Norwegian war is that the Allied countries have failed to recognize the enemy's formidable strength, and that incomplete measures will not enable them to achieve victory. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that when Prime Minister Chamberlain rises to speak in the House of Commons today, he will be aware that the issue now in danger far exceeds the scope of the subject of his speech. From a strict military standpoint, the failure in Norway is not enough to endanger our final victory. Its true significance lies in its relationship with energy, foresight, and efficiency, because the conduct of war depends on these elements. We are clearly aware that we are now truly gathering strength for a final decisive attack. What is more important is that we must be able to break the doubts of the outside world, because the attitude of various neutral countries, which are of great importance to foreign diplomacy, is largely based on our strength and future. Our moral aspect is secondary. The world, which is eagerly awaiting, will study the national reaction to the government's handling of the situation, and its thoroughness will not be different from the event itself. The "Daily Mail" said that today's debate will be very broad, and the people all want to know how to defeat Germany. The current government must have urgent initiatives. The "News Chronicle" also reported that we have only been waging half a war so far, because we are fighting with surplus time and surplus resources. Now we must end this dangerous and foolish action and begin to wage a total war. The "Daily Herald" expressed regret as to whether Chamberlain is suitable to rule (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<p>Paris, [Date]: The people and official circles here are eagerly awaiting the results of today's debate in the British House of Commons. It is expected that there will be repercussions on the position of the French government. "L'Intransigeant" reported, "Prime Minister Chamberlain has deep roots in the Munich concept. May I ask, will Mr. Reynaud easily abandon it? " "L'Ordre" reported that Chamberlain should know that appeasement and misleading the country are one and the same. The German government had already quickly learned that the Allied countries' decision on Norway was a reality (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<h3>Italy's Newly Built Main Warship Enters the Fleet; Weighs 35,000 Tons; Equipped with Large-Caliber Cannons</h3>
<p>Milan, [Date]: Italy's newly built main warship, "Littorio," was incorporated into the fleet yesterday. The ship weighs 35,000 tons. It underwent a launching ceremony on August 22, 1937, after being inspected by Italian Admiral Farina. "Littorio" and "Vittorio Veneto" are known as sister ships. The ship has a speed of 30 knots. The ship is equipped with 38.1 cm caliber cannons, twelve 15.1 cm caliber howitzers, and twelve 9 cm caliber anti-aircraft guns, 40 machine guns, and three sloops. Italy now has a total of six warships in the fleet (Haitong News Agency, 7th).</p>

<h3>Tensions Rise in the Mediterranean; US and the Vatican Attempt to Avert Disaster; Try to Prevent Italy from Joining the War; Britain Denies Asking Italy to Clarify Its Position; Return of Loraine, Hope for Peace Not Yet Lost</h3>
<p>Rome, [Date]: After Crown Prince Umberto of Italy met with the Pope, Prime Minister Mussolini was received at the Palazzo Venezia yesterday. Prime Minister Mussolini also met with the two army commanders for more than an hour to discuss Italy's war preparations. Authoritative sources here revealed last night that when the Pope received Crown Prince Umberto and the Princess yesterday morning, he mentioned President Roosevelt's efforts for peace. The Pope also expressed his hope that Italy would be spared from participating in the war. Vatican authoritative circles said that when Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, secretly visited the Pope on Saturday, the Pope reportedly agreed to work with President Roosevelt to promote peace and prevent Italy from joining the war. This news was transmitted by church sources. It is said that the US Ambassador to Rome, Mr. Phillips, and President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, spent time in Florence together, which is related to this matter. Mr. Phillips will return to Rome today to hold important talks with Italian government leaders, including the Prime Minister. Last night, British Ambassador Loraine returned to Rome. People from all walks of life believe that this is another role in the international peace situation. It is believed that Sir Loraine will meet with Prime Minister Mussolini in the next few days, or it may happen today. At that time, the British Ambassador will have the opportunity to explain to Prime Minister Mussolini the British view on the Allied Navy's increased defense in the Mediterranean. In addition, after the Pope received Crown Prince Umberto and the Princess, he also received the French Ambassador to the Vatican, Mr. Roche. After this news was released, it was believed that France will also participate in the Vatican and the United States' efforts to quell the war. Some Vatican officials even believe that these efforts will turn hostility into friendship. The Italian government is rapidly preparing for war (United Press, 7th).</p>
<p>Vatican City, [Date]: It is rumored that Pope Pius XII gave a plan regarding the Mediterranean situation to President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor. Officials here recently denied this, saying that the Vatican will do its part to ensure that all efforts will end the war as soon as possible, but it has never put forward any specific suggestions (Havas, 6th).</p>
<p>Rome, [Date]: Diplomatic circles learned last night that Britain has sent a note to Italy, requesting clarification of Italy's true position in the European war, and expressed a strong hope to receive a reply before May 16. The reports of Britain's increased defense in the Mediterranean are said to be related to this request. It is believed that this document was submitted by British Chargé d'affaires Charles, on the same day that US Ambassador to Rome, Mr. Phillips, met with Prime Minister Mussolini. It is understood that this note directly questions whether Italy is neutral or participating in the war. It is believed that Britain is dissatisfied with Italy's current non-belligerent status. However, the British Embassy denies having heard of this news (United Press, 7th).</p>
<p>London, [Date]: According to various newspapers, Britain will ask Italy to explain its position on the current situation. This statement has been firmly denied by British officials (Havas, 7th).</p>
<p>London, [Date]: It is rumored that the Italian government has raised several questions with the British government regarding the measures taken by Britain in the Mediterranean, requesting clarification of the reasons. This statement has not been confirmed, but according to well-informed sources, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano did raise several questions requesting explanation when he spoke with British Chargé d'affaires Charles last week (Havas, 6th).</p>
<p>Rome, [Date]: British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Loraine, returned here from London last night. US Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Phillips, recently visited northern Italy for several days and has now returned to Rome (Haitong News Agency, 7th).</p>
<p>London, [Date]: Reuters learned today that when British Ambassador to Italy, Loraine, returns to his post in Rome, he will visit Italian Foreign Minister Ciano as a matter of courtesy. This is almost certain, so this matter has no special relationship. A Reuters diplomatic reporter learned that British economic expert Mr. Perry has returned to Rome. It is said that this trip is purely related to the settlement agreement and is not related to any broader commercial purpose (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<p>Moscow, [Date]: The Commercial Newspaper "Trud" published an article yesterday, saying that Italy has taken a stance of participating in the war, hoping to control the Mediterranean, but is now waiting for a suitable opportunity. Italy's current war preparations are actually intended to intimidate the Allied countries and attempt to prevent the Allied countries from invading the Balkans. "Once the neutrality of the Balkans is broken, it will immediately result in Italian intervention. ...... Italy's intimidation may affect the Allied countries' plan to create a new war situation in the Balkans. However, if the Allied countries' plan can be realized, then Italy will join the war (United Press, 7th).</p>
<h3>Rumor of Telephone Conversation Between British and French Leaders; Discussing the Mediterranean Situation; Both Britain and France Deny</h3>
<p>Berlin, [Date]: The German News Agency recently issued the following report, revealing the content of a telephone conversation between the British and French prime ministers. It is said that French Prime Minister Reynaud spoke with British Prime Minister Chamberlain at 10:10 pm on April 30 (Western European time). After discussing economic issues, Reynaud told Chamberlain, "General Weygand has fully prepared for the actions that both sides agreed on May 15, but said that Chamberlain cannot absolutely insist on the date, because such actions may have to be launched slightly later." Chamberlain seemed unhappy when he heard this and replied, "I have the impression that the people there think that time is absolutely necessary." Reynaud said, "There are still various difficulties that must be resolved with Turkey before action can be taken." Chamberlain then urged him to talk to Turkey again. Reynaud then said that he would try his best to remove "spiritual difficulties." Chamberlain then sternly demanded that Reynaud notify Britain of the preparations by May 20. After the two sides exchanged pleasantries, the telephone conversation ended at 10:25 pm (Haitong News Agency, 7th).</p>
<p>Paris, [Date]: German newspapers all carried news that British Prime Minister Chamberlain had a telephone conversation with French Prime Minister Reynaud on April 30 from 10:10 pm to 10:25 pm to discuss the actions that the two countries should take in the Mediterranean. The French government recently issued a communique denying this, saying that the British and French prime ministers never had such a conversation, and that the German propaganda trick is not worth mentioning (Havas, 7th).</p>
<p>London, [Date]: Regarding the rumors from the German side that Prime Minister Chamberlain of the British Prime Minister had a telephone conversation with French Prime Minister Reynaud on April 30, British officials, following the French authorities, firmly denied this, saying that the Prime Minister had fully exchanged views with Prime Minister Reynaud at the British-French Supreme Military Joint Conference on April 28 and that there was no need to do so again (Havas, 7th).</p>
<h3>Fires of War Spread Across Southeastern Europe: Public in Panic and Uneasy; Rumors of German Troops Massing on Hungarian Border Awaiting Orders; Southern Nations Augmenting Military Preparations, Maintaining Vigilance; Berlin Intensifies Psychological Warfare</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland - A Berlin correspondent for the *Basler Nachrichten* recently wired that Germany is again engaging in "psychological warfare," claiming it will launch an offensive on the Western Front. However, the country is accustomed to using misdirection, and it typically makes such pronouncements before taking action elsewhere. In recent days, this tactic has become even more pronounced, particularly with the fabrication of a long-distance phone call between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Reynaud. It is believed that the intention is to create an atmosphere of disorder and unease. Notably, German propaganda has made no mention of Hungary, maintains a rather reserved attitude towards Romania, and considers Bulgaria the focal point of the European crisis, even more so than Yugoslavia and Greece. All these points are worthy of attention. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The main issue discussed in German newspapers today remains the rapid advance of German forces in Norway and the Anglo-French conspiracies in the Balkans. The *Berliner Börsen-Zeitung* prominently published the content of Chamberlain and Reynaud's telephone conversation (April 30th), arguing that it demonstrated the aggressive intentions of Britain and France. The premiers' talk only confirmed the military preparations of Britain and France in the Mediterranean and their intention to stir up trouble in the region. The newspaper concluded that all preparations must be completed by May 20th at the latest, at which point southeastern Europe may be engulfed in flames. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>London - The Information Ministry stated that in the past 36 hours, German radio and news agencies have spread absurd rumors about border disputes erupting in the Balkan Peninsula. These rumors are largely contradictory, and others, originating from Berlin, were denied by Berlin itself within only one or two hours. The German purpose is clear: to disseminate false information to create an atmosphere of unease that benefits German objectives. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - According to reliable sources, German troops are concentrating on the Hungarian border. Simultaneously, rumors are circulating that relations between Hungary and the Slovak state have once again become strained. Political figures here believe that Germany is about to intervene in Hungary, hoping to expand the war to the Balkan Peninsula, thereby forcing Italy to take a clearer stance. Furthermore, according to some reports, the Hlinka Guard of the Slovak People's Party has repeatedly staged demonstrations in recent weeks, following orders from the German authorities, demanding that Hungary return the land obtained under the Vienna Arbitration Award to the Slovak state. The Hungarian government is quite uneasy. In short, Hungary is in a perilous situation and may no longer be able to rely on Italy as a protector. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia - German "tourists" have been arriving in Yugoslavia in a steady stream recently. Some districts have even had branch leaders of the Nazi Party assigned to them. Foreign observers here believe that Yugoslavia is likely to become the next Norway. However, unlike Norway, Yugoslavia is well-prepared militarily. The government and people of the city-state are deeply aware of the impending crisis, and therefore have been swift in preparing and maintaining vigilance. Regarding the Yugoslav army, a prominent American journalist even called it "one of the most elite armies in Europe." Germany must take this into consideration. Germany's primary goal is to exploit the 500,000 ethnic Germans within Yugoslavia to launch an offensive from within. Therefore, German political police have infiltrated Yugoslavia to secretly instruct these minorities. Under these circumstances, if Italy attempts to occupy the western coast of Yugoslavia via the Adriatic Sea, Germany will definitely send troops to invade the Croatian region of Yugoslavia. It is worth noting that Yugoslavia has made preparations, and Germany's plans may not easily succeed. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome - The *Il Popolo d'Italia* reported last night that Turkey has amassed a large army on the Greek border, causing unrest in Bulgaria. The newspaper claimed that the concentration of Turkish troops may be related to the British naval activity in the eastern Mediterranean. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria - Foreign observers here said that the German semi-official news agency, Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro, issued a report claiming that Turkey had concentrated troops on the Greek border. Diplomatic authorities in concerned countries have denied this. Germany's strategy is to spread alarming rumors to cause panic and unrest among the neutral small countries of southeastern Europe. However, this strategy has undoubtedly failed in Bulgaria, as relations between Turkey and Bulgaria are extremely friendly and are becoming increasingly close in an atmosphere of mutual trust. The reported troop movements are completely inaccurate. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany Offers Assurances, Respects Swedish Neutrality; Swedish Army Chief Speaks on Radio, Vows to Fight for Independence and Freedom</h3>
<p>Stockholm - Swedish Foreign Minister Günther recently stated that King Gustav V has exchanged letters with Hitler regarding the political situation. Sweden has repeatedly affirmed its neutrality, and Germany has given assurances of respecting Swedish neutrality. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The official German news agency announced that German leader Hitler and Swedish King Gustav exchanged written opinions on the political situation in the latter half of April. This action has strengthened the complete alignment of future policies between the two countries, in accordance with the statements already announced by the German and Swedish governments. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - General Ericsson, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army, recently delivered a radio address, stating, "If we are forced by circumstances to resort to war, we will not hesitate to fight. Even though war may bring losses, if we continue to enjoy freedom, we will surely be able to quickly recover. Conversely, if we lose our freedom under foreign guardianship, what value will life and property have? We have recently understood that the interests of the nation are our interests. The nation can guarantee our security, but when necessary, it may require us to accept sacrifices, even sacrificing our lives. In this, we must be brave and unyielding to protect our country's freedom and independence." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Parliament Passes Bill, Grants Broader Powers to Military Authorities</h3>
<p>Istanbul - An Anqara dispatch states that the Turkish Parliament today passed ten bills, stipulating that in extraordinary circumstances, military authorities are granted broader powers, including requisitioning public and private property and services. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Netherlands on Alert, Officers' Leave Canceled</h3>
<p>The Hague - The Government Information Service recently issued a communiqué stating that all leave, regular or temporary, has been canceled for officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, as well as employees of war industries. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Polish Destroyer Sunk in Norwegian Waters; Britain Compensates with Newly Built Warship; Stavanger Airport Bombed Again</h3>
<p>London - According to an official announcement, the Polish destroyer "Grom," which has been working closely with the British fleet since the start of the war, was recently sunk by bombs while operating in the Norwegian Sea. One officer and 65 soldiers are missing and presumed dead. The British government is willing to compensate for the "Grom" with a new warship currently under construction, and the Polish government has accepted this offer. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - The Polish destroyer "Grom" had a displacement of 2,144 tons, a speed of 3 knots per hour, and was equipped with four 4.7-inch guns, four anti-aircraft guns, and mine-laying equipment. The entire crew consisted of 80 officers and soldiers. At the beginning of the European war, it and other Polish warships joined the British fleet, under the command of the British naval authorities. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>London - It has now been learned that Captain Wynne, commander of the British destroyer "HMS Havant," which was bombed and sunk by German aircraft while escorting troop transports in Norwegian territorial waters, has been rescued and is safe. The ship's survivors departed from a port in Scotland last night, heading south. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Ministry of the Navy recently announced that a British and French convoy, escorted by our warships, was attacked by German aircraft in the North Sea on the 3rd of this month. German aircraft dropped multiple bombs, but none hit the transport ships. Only our destroyer "Bison" was sunk, but most of the sailors have been rescued. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>London - It is now known that a squadron of British bombers, led by Squadron Leader Thorold, bombed the Stavanger airfield in Norway yesterday, temporarily rendering it ineffective. Enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes put up strong resistance. All but two of the British planes returned to base. It is reported that the two missing planes were last seen after the squadron reached its target, spread out, and dropped bombs individually. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Estimated Losses of German Merchant Ships Reach Approximately 600,000 Tons Since Outbreak of War</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced that since April 1st, the Germans have lost a total of 300,000 tons of merchant ships, most of which were sunk during the Norwegian campaign. This does not include transport ships and supply ships. The above figure brings Germany's losses since the start of the war to 600,000 tons, accounting for 15% of Germany's pre-war total tonnage. Confirmed captures, sinkings, or self-scuttling of German merchant ships total 454,000 tons. It is estimated that there are another 30 unidentified ships, totaling 150,000 tons, that have been sunk by Allied submarines, mines, and aircraft. According to reports from Rotterdam, the German motor vessel "Robert Ley" (27,288 tons) sank in the Skagerrak on the evening of April 12th. There are also reports of two German ships sinking near Delfzijl. In the week ending late on April 28th, German actions resulted in the sinking of four British ships totaling 6,689 tons, one Allied ship of 1,458 tons, and two neutral ships totaling 298 tons. The names of the above ships are not to be released under the new regulations. British losses in tonnage are less than one-third of the average weekly losses to date. The convoy system continues to be successful. As of May 1st, a total of 19,098 British, Allied, and neutral ships had been convoyed, with 31 being sunk. Meanwhile, 3,457 ships were convoyed by the French, with 7 being sunk. Although the Germans have heavily bombed our ships in Norwegian territorial waters, our ships have put up extremely strong defenses. One ship was attacked more than forty times in a single day, with German aircraft dropping 150 bombs, none of which hit. There were no casualties on board. The ship's anti-aircraft guns shot down two enemy aircraft and damaged four others. Another warship escorting troop transports shot down five enemy aircraft in three days. As far as is known, there are currently no German ships in Narvik or Norwegian territorial waters north of there. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>US Focuses on Far East, Pacific Fleet to Remain; Public and Government Sympathize with China, Condemn Illegal Aggression; Broad Embargo Against Japan Under Discussion in Congress</h3>
<p>Washington - Naval experts here declared yesterday that although the European war is raging, the United States is still focusing its attention on the Far East. This spring's large-scale maneuvers by the US fleet in the Pacific demonstrate America's concern for the Far East more clearly than any official statement. After the exercises, the US fleet will remain indefinitely in several locations in the Pacific. Because the Latin and British countries neighboring the Pacific mutually abolish armaments based on friendly relations, the only meaning of the US fleet concentrating in the Pacific is to prevent difficulties in the Far East. The fact that the US Navy does not prepare for defense on the American Atlantic coast shows America's bias towards Asia. This defense surprises the Europeans, who are fighting each other to the death, but this fact can be explained by a part of the general American belief. America's views on Europe: first, it recognizes that the powers of Europe are roughly equal to each other, and no country seems to threaten American security; second, the legendary West (the West refers to Asia) is the border of the United States and where American commercial interests lie; third, in the Far East, Japan's naval and military forces are very powerful, while China and the Soviet Union may experience disturbances, and their preparations are relatively limited. In comparison, the forces are quite uneven, and any incident is likely to occur; fourth, the United States has territories on the islands in the Pacific, which must be guaranteed security. The relationship between the United States and any Far Eastern country is based on the hope of stabilizing the status quo in the Pacific and expanding trade. The official and non-official sympathy of the United States towards China stems from the American belief that China, which is moving towards a modern national economy and modern politics, should be allowed to develop itself and should not be interfered with by other countries. Therefore, in the past, the United States opposed Russia's aggression against China, and now, it at least diplomatically resists Japan's aggression against China. The basic requirement of the US policy towards China is the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922. This provision stipulates that any country should respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China and should not take any action to monopolize China's economic interests. The United States opposes Japan's establishment of puppet governments in Manchuria and Central China. The United States only recognizes the Chongqing government, which is at war with Japan, as the legitimate government of China. In order to increase the Chongqing government's ability to resist the war, the United States has indirectly lent China US$45,000,000 and has repeatedly warned Japan diplomatically to encourage China's resistance. Japan has now become the most detested object of the United States. The United States has repeatedly protested Japan's occupation of Chinese territory, denouncing it as illegal and endangering American rights in China. Some of these rights are guaranteed by the US-Japan Treaty. US-Japan relations are now very tense, so the United States has taken the step of abolishing the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. Although at present only a moral embargo is adopted in terms of gasoline and aircraft exports, several broader embargoes against Japan are under discussion in Congress, but no decision has been made. A broad embargo can be implemented with the approval of the President and the Secretary of State. However, the President and the Secretary of State must act prudently and only implement such a plan when the whole country believes that it is necessary. At this time, loans to China, moral embargoes, and certain indirect means have been adopted. For example, the United States' increased shipbuilding program is one of the indirect actions. Although this is not a direct opposition to Japan, it is obviously designed for Japan's expansionist forces. Naval officers have stated that the number of Japanese fleets is already unknown, so the United States needs to build new ships. Another naval officer also expressed his personal opinion that a US-Japan war is inevitable. Since President Roosevelt took office, the United States has completed 122 new ships, with 72 currently under construction. There are also 43 others that have been passed by Congress, and 24 have been drafted and will be sent to Congress. There are also 43 that have been passed by the House of Representatives. Recently, the most attention has been paid to the issue of the Dutch East Indies. The statement issued by Japan is generally regarded as Japan intending to take the opportunity to occupy the Dutch East Indies once Germany occupies the Netherlands. Regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, the US government has warned Japan that the United States is extremely concerned about any changes in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Many observers believe that the result of the Sino-Japanese War will inevitably be mutual destruction. At this time, if the Soviet Union is not very strong, the balance of power in the Far East can still be established, and the United States will be quite satisfied at this moment. The current lack of vigorous action is partly due to waiting for the outcome of the incident and partly due to the hope that once the European war ends, Britain and France will cooperate more actively with the United States in the Far East.

<h3>Panama Canal Defenses Consolidated; US Deputy Chief of Staff Speaks, Ready to Assist All States</h3>
<p>Washington - US Army Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Sterett, speaking recently at the American Society of Engineers, strongly stated that the Panama Canal Zone's defenses are consolidated and sufficient to cope with any eventuality. He said, "Any attempt to sabotage the Panama Canal has been considered by the authorities and measures have been taken to prevent it." The construction of the new locks will be completed in 1945, at which time defense efficiency will increase by 50%. If an aggressor is determined to obtain a base in the territory of the American republics, the defense forces of each country are weak and insufficient to cope with it. It is actually necessary for us to send troops to assist, so that foreign countries do not destroy the territorial integrity of our neighboring countries. If an invaded country obtains a base in a certain republic in the Americas, we and this republic will be threatened. Therefore, we must deploy a strong military force, ready to move at any time, so that we can quickly defeat any "blitzkrieg" attempt. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht Leaves England for France Today; Reportedly Wishes Sweden to Maintain Neutrality; Britain Refutes Claim of Imprisoning Norwegian Commander</h3>
<p>London - Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht told a Reuters reporter yesterday that Norway had suffered heavy losses, with many casualties and missing persons. The Norwegian army had also lost a large part of its forces. However, there were still excellent Norwegian troops in the north, which were completely unharmed. This army would be of great help to the Allied forces, as it was the most elite in the Norwegian army, familiar with the rugged terrain, and well-equipped, but lacking anti-aircraft guns. There were approximately 50,000 to 100,000 German troops in Norway. In any case, their number was quite large. The Norwegian government had never sought help from Sweden, as Norway did not want its Swedish friends to suffer the same pain as the Norwegians and share the same fate. Sweden would, to the best of its ability, maintain its neutrality, but how things would evolve in the future was difficult to predict. When the reporter asked about the rumors of Norwegians such as Quisling being traitors, Koht replied that he had never heard of any Norwegian treason. There were Norwegians who sympathized with the Nazis, but there was no treason. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - Foreign Minister Koht, in response to widespread rumors that the German army's invasion of Norway was aided by Norwegian collaborators, stated yesterday that this was inaccurate. He said, "We have not discovered any clear acts of treason. The German army's entry into Norway was easy due to the sudden attack. You cannot blame us for not taking precautions. The truth is that we never expected the German army to invade." Koht also denied the claim that the mines in the Oslo Fjord and other bays were sabotaged by traitors, rendering them ineffective, as there were no mines laid in those waters. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - Foreign Minister Koht met with Prime Minister Chamberlain this afternoon. Afterwards, he told a Havas reporter, "I plan to travel to Paris on the 8th of this month for a two or three day stay to hold talks with French Prime Minister Reynaud, Defense Minister Daladier, and other key figures." He then met with reporters from various newspapers and stated, "In this chaotic world, our country is not isolated and helpless. Thinking of this fills me with excitement. The ideals that our country cherishes are no different from those cherished by Britain and France. We have always recognized ourselves as a small country with exceptionally weak military strength. It was difficult for us to shoulder major responsibilities in the international arena, so we strictly adhered to neutrality, not daring to overstep. Today, we have been forced into war to defend our homeland. But we ask ourselves if we have done anything to deserve this. Therefore, our determination to resist is even stronger." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Norwegian Troops Defend the Glomma River</p>
<p>London - The Norwegian Telegraph Agency reported that Norwegian troops were still holding the Glomma River between Røros and Støren. 250 German soldiers crossed Røros yesterday and headed towards Glomdalsfjella. Norwegian troops in Trøndelag, northeast of Elverum, were ordered to retreat after the Allied forces withdrew. It was reported that the Germans had arrested many civilians, accusing them of aiding the Norwegian army. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>Stockholm - An evening newspaper here recently reported that Norwegian troops were clashing with German troops between Rögnas and Singhus, with fierce fighting.

<p>London - The German claim that a British warship had imprisoned Norwegian Commander General Ruge and issued orders in his name for the Norwegian army to continue fighting was refuted by responsible authorities in London. They stated that General Ruge had voluntarily boarded the British warship, which was solely for the use of Ruge and his staff. His subsequent actions were decided by Ruge himself. Ruge is currently in Norway. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>French Troops Retreating Arrive in Scotland</p>
<p>London - French expeditionary forces withdrawing from central Norway have arrived at a port in northern Scotland aboard several transport ships. Although these troops were heavily bombed by German planes during their retreat from the front lines and boarding the ships, they did not suffer a single casualty. A French battalion commander told the press after landing that they had been stationed in Norway for ten days and had not seen any German troops. However, the area where they landed was heavily bombed by German planes, causing heavy losses to the residents. There were no military targets in the area, but the German planes not only bombed but also strafed with machine guns. The residents sought refuge in the mountains, and even the Allied soldiers mostly hid in the nearby forests during the day, only coming out at night. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Papal See in Rome Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Rome - Hohenbach, a correspondent for the Haitong News Agency stationed in Rome, reported yesterday that the Holy See in Rome had categorically denied the rumor reported by a Swiss newspaper that Pope Pius XII would move to Portugal if war broke out in the Mediterranean. It was claimed that although the Holy See and Portugal would sign a political agreement today, it was unrelated to the Swiss newspaper report. Pope Pius hoped that even if war broke out in the Mediterranean and Italy was drawn into the conflict, the Holy See would not leave the Vatican. (Haitong, 7th)</p>

<h3>Central Authorities Express Determination to Maintain Currency System; Claims of Restricting Withdrawals are Pure Rumors, Firm Statement Sent to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 7th - Recently, due to seasonal financial factors, speculators have taken the opportunity to disrupt the market, causing fluctuations in the Shanghai exchange rate. The government is making every effort to maintain stability. However, malicious individuals have spread rumors that the government will further restrict withdrawals in Shanghai, causing public anxiety. Upon hearing this news, the Ministry of Finance stated that since the beginning of the war of resistance, the government has been determined to maintain currency credibility and stabilize the financial system. All financial policies are based on this principle. The above rumors were fabricated by speculators and traitors in an attempt to disrupt public morale and undermine the financial system, which is abhorrent. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association have been instructed to declare that there is no such thing. It is hoped that when this message reaches Shanghai, the rumors will be refuted on their own, demonstrating the futility of the rumor-mongers' efforts.</p>
<p>Banking Industry's Receipts and Payments Resume Normalcy Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has been maintained by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, the British and American exchange rates have been relaxed, the market has stabilized, rumors have gradually subsided, and public confidence has slightly improved. Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate was the same as the day before, while the US exchange rate decreased by 0.125, which is considered stable. The run on banks and financial institutions has indeed completely subsided, and the normal state of receipts and payments has resumed since yesterday. It is reported that at the beginning of this bank run, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications supplied the industry with as much cash as possible to meet the withdrawal needs of the banks and financial institutions. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited a financier yesterday who stated that the Shanghai environment is becoming increasingly difficult year by year, and the market has been alarmed repeatedly, especially this year. However, the banking industry has taken into account the interests of depositors, customers, society, and the government's wartime financial policies, preserving the nation's vitality, leading by example, refraining from improper business practices, and assisting the authorities in suppressing speculation.</p>
<h3>Firm Belief in Resistance and Nation-Building; Commemorating May 7th</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the May 7th National Humiliation Day, commemorating the day in 1915 when Japan presented China with the Twenty-One Demands, requiring a response within 48 hours. Yuan Shikai, who was seeking foreign support to establish himself as emperor, recognized the demands on May 9th. The Chinese community in the city did not hold a commemorative ceremony yesterday, but unanimously reaffirmed their determination to resist and build the nation, support the government, and strive for final victory.</p>
<h3>Intensified Restrictions on Carrying Legal Tender Inland for Export</h3>
<p>Limit of 50 Yuan per person, effective this month</p>
<p>The limit for inland travelers carrying legal tender for export was previously set at 500 yuan, but was reduced to 200 yuan in February of this year. The Zhejiang Customs has recently received an order from the Ministry to limit each person to 50 yuan, which has been implemented this month.</p>
<h3>Polish Community in the City Celebrates National Day</h3>
<p>The Polish community in the city celebrated the 149th National Day and the anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution last Sunday (May 3rd) at the Polish Legation. The entire Polish community sang the national anthem, followed by a speech by Mr. Rosić, Counselor of the Polish Legation, explaining the significance of the National Day and the promulgation of the Constitution. Finally, Mr. Kidder, President of the Polish Cultural Association, gave a speech stating that Poland fully embodies the spirit of its new constitution today, citing the speech of Mr. Herriot, President of the French Chamber of Deputies, claiming that Poland is fighting for democracy and that Poland will not die. Although its body is in the tomb, its spirit will endure forever.</p>
<h3>Coal Dust Market Actually Uses US Dollars for Pricing; Improper Measures Alienate the People; Nanyang Coal Briquette Factory Sells Coal Briquettes at Discounted Prices</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Coal Briquette Factory began selling coal briquettes at discounted prices yesterday, setting up ten discounted sales points, each selling 20 dan per day, totaling 200 dan per day. Sales hours are from 2:00 PM daily until sold out. Each person is limited to purchasing 3 jiao of national currency at a time, which is equivalent to 4 catties of coal briquettes, until the end of this month. The ten discounted sales points are listed below: (1) Song Taichang, 154 Route des Pères; (2) Xieyuan, 270 Rue Cardinal Mercier; (3) Dasen, 126 Rue Sazare; (4) Qiantai Xing, 202 Shanhai Pass Road; (5) Jiufeng, Lane 53, No. 66 Ximen Road; (6) Fuchang, 6 Route Grelier; (7) Kunyuan Xing, 206 Ximen Road; (8) Yixing, 985 Tokyo Road; (9) Yuxing, 220 Route Tenant de la Tour; (10) Yongmao, 68 Rue Jules Pasteau.</p>
<p>Priced in US Dollars</p>
<p>A reporter from Datong News Agency interviewed the Coal Industry Association. Mr. Qi-sheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Association, told the reporter that the coal dust market has been pricing transactions in US dollars since May 5th, which caused him great indignation. It was found that the current price of coal dust is US$7 per ton, equivalent to RMB 155. The market price has risen, and all future transactions will be based on the US dollar. Daily necessities such as raw materials for coal briquettes are actually priced in US dollars. Even from the perspective of knowledgeable people in the industry, this is considered inappropriate.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Corruption According to Mr. Bao Zhezhi, it is also a public secret that hoarders are manipulating the coal briquette market. Therefore, it is hoped that the coal industry can be cautious in selecting its customers. Orders for coal dust or coal briquettes placed by outsiders through insiders should be treated with caution, without consideration for personal relationships. People in the industry should not seek extra profits and act as accomplices. Coal briquette factories must strictly enforce the rejection of delivery orders from speculators. Raw material suppliers must not sell to third parties who are not in the coal briquette industry. Finally, it is hoped that the Public Works Department will have absolute disciplinary measures.</p>
<h3>Notice Regarding Postal Parcels</h3>
<p>Notice from the Parcel Section of the Postal Administration: (1) Large parcels and bulk small packages to various locations in the Fujian area will be resumed, but the weight of each parcel (except those to Xiamen) should be limited to 20 kilograms. (2) Large parcels, commercial parcels, and bulk small packages to Hengshui, Jixian, Nangong, and their surrounding areas in the Hebei area should be temporarily suspended. (3) Large parcels and bulk small packages to the Jiaozhou Bureau in the Jiangsu area can now be resumed.

(6) Parcels and bulk small packages to Mengyin and Chaocheng Bureaus, as well as individual scattered parcels and medicine parcels to Gaocheng Bureau, can now be accepted as usual. (7) Individual scattered parcels and medicine parcels to Daxingzhuang in the Su area can now be resumed.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Sending Parcels with German Goods</h3>
<p>Same Treatment for Shipments to Germans</p>
<p>Notice from the Postal Administration: Parcels and small packages passing through Vietnam that contain German goods or are sent from or to German citizens will be temporarily suspended from acceptance. However, if the sender indicates on the package "to be forwarded via domestic postal routes" and the domestic postal routes are indeed passable, this restriction does not apply. This matter was previously notified in the Bureau's Notice No. 1606 on April 4 of this year. Now, it has been determined that samples passing through Vietnam that contain German goods or are sent from or to German citizens will be treated the same way.</p>
<h3>American Community in the City Prepares to Hold "US Foreign Trade Week" with Grand Banquets and Essay Contests</h3>

The International Young Men's Association will also hold a grand banquet on May 21st.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Cracks Down on Prices; Emphasizes Public Reports; Yu Huaqing's Observations on Rising Prices of Daily Necessities Confirm That It Is an Excuse to Seek Illegitimate Profits Through Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession issued a notice on May 3rd prohibiting merchants selling essential goods from unreasonably raising prices by taking advantage of fluctuations in the legal tender exchange rate. A reporter recently asked Mr. Cabot, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, who is responsible for handling this matter, about the effect of the notice. Cabot replied that no one had reported anything yet, so the Public Works Department had not taken action against those who hoard and profiteer. Three weeks ago, the Public Works Department issued a notice asking the public to report hoarding and profiteering. If the public reports, the Bureau will definitely investigate. The reporter asked if this meant that the Public Works Department would not take any action unless a report was made. Cabot replied that it was indeed the case, and that the Bureau was awaiting reports. If there was a significant case of hoarding and profiteering, a special committee would be formed to investigate.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Opinion</p>
<p>Due to recent fluctuations in the exchange rate, various industries have raised their selling prices, especially for daily necessities, causing great hardship to people in the middle and lower classes, and making each day seem like a year for the working class. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the Shanghai business community, to seek his opinion. Mr. Yu granted an interview and made the following remarks. Mr. Yu said that all prices in Shanghai have soared recently, with the excuse being fluctuations in the exchange rate, but this is not actually true. Even if the exchange rate fluctuated, the first to be affected would naturally be imported goods. Calculating the fastest possible delivery time, goods would need at least three months to arrive in Shanghai to be affected by the depreciation of the exchange rate. Therefore, the goods currently sold in stores are all in stock, so there is no reason to raise prices immediately. For example, on the morning of May 2nd, when the exchange rate fluctuated, some stores immediately raised prices by 30%, which is extremely absurd. This is actually using the fluctuation of the exchange rate as an excuse to seek illegitimate profits, which is unfair. As for rice and coal briquettes, which have also risen recently, this is even more inappropriate. These two items are essential for the daily life of ordinary people and are of utmost importance.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about coal briquettes. Some time ago, the Chamber of Commerce invited the coal industry to repeatedly discuss fair prices. The original price of coal dust was set at 100 yuan per ton. The cost of shipping was calculated at 28 shillings per ton, resulting in a loss of about 5 shillings. Now that the cost of shipping has been reduced to 23 shillings per ton, it is exactly 100 yuan per ton, without any loss. The cost of manufacturing coal briquettes is about 15-16 yuan per ton, plus a profit of 4-5 yuan, making it 20 yuan per ton. Adding the profit of 4-5 yuan for coal shops and 1-2 yuan for transportation, the total cost is 126 yuan per ton, or 6.3 yuan per dan. Even if affected by the exchange rate, the cost of coal dust would only increase by 20 yuan, totaling 146 yuan per ton at most. How can it be as high as 190 yuan per ton? Moreover, how can the exchange rate affect goods in stock? Are all the manufacturing costs, shipping costs, and profits of coal briquettes in Shanghai also calculated in foreign exchange and raised in price accordingly? Or are they saying that there is no significant profit to be made from making coal briquettes, so they will raise the price and sell them to yarn factories instead? If this is the case, their intentions seem inappropriate. In addition, for the sake of maintaining fair prices some time ago, the Chamber of Commerce invited the coal industry to repeatedly discuss and reach an agreement. Even if there is an immediate impact on prices due to the fluctuation of the exchange rate, they should request the Chamber of Commerce to state their reasons and reconvene to discuss the matter. However, they have resolutely taken action and raised prices twice in the past few days, no wonder the citizens are comparing them to taking advantage of a disaster.</p>
<p>As for rice</p>
<p>The price has also been rising uncontrollably. Is the rice being sold in the market now the goods that have arrived after the exchange rate fluctuation? If not, is the recent price increase due to the rice merchants and general speculators manipulating and hoarding goods? Any discerning person can see this. If this continues, how will the livelihoods of ordinary people be sustained? Weighing the pros and cons, the concession authorities and the city's Chamber of Commerce must take effective measures to curb this. Shanghai has a population of 4 million. How can we sit idly by and ignore the livelihoods of the majority of people for the sake of the interests of a few? It is hoped that merchants in all industries will prioritize their conscience in this extraordinary period, so that we can overcome the difficulties together. Otherwise, the future of Shanghai is at stake. What is the use of striving for unjust wealth?</p>
<p>Sales Have Stagnated</p>
<p>It is also learned that all items have immediately increased their selling prices during this sharp decline in the black market exchange rate. Among them, the rise in coal and coal briquettes is the most rampant. In addition, such items as cloth, hardware, general miscellaneous goods, and food have also soared in price. Some stores have even removed the price tags from their goods and are raising prices arbitrarily, without any limits. In fact, due to the extremely high cost of living and the difficulty of maintaining it, consumers in Shanghai have already been trying their best to save money. Therefore, consumption has greatly decreased. The current inventory of various goods in Shanghai is very large due to the competition to hoard goods. Even the customs warehouses are filled to capacity. Although the customs have repeatedly urged the release of goods, the sales are limited, and speculators are still trying to hoard goods, so many have not been released from the warehouses. Other clothing and miscellaneous goods are also experiencing an oversupply due to reduced consumption. In the end, those who only seek profit will only have themselves to blame.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Strictly Prohibits Transfers of Telephone Sets</h3>
<p>Announcement from Shanghai Telephone Company: Telephone sets may not be transferred privately. If discovered, penalties will be imposed in accordance with regulations. At the same time, the police authorities are requested to stop children from flying kites. It is reported that the new equipment ordered by the company will be shipped to Shanghai in the second quarter of this year, and the installation for new applicants should be completed by July or August.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Association Holds Meeting Today to Discuss Dismissal Plan</h3>
<p>Since the Refugee Relief Association of this city started dismissing refugees last month, approximately 6,000 refugees have been sent back to their hometowns from various shelters throughout Shanghai so far. The dismissal fee for April, as stipulated by the Board of Directors of the Association, was 18 yuan for adults and 13 yuan for children (with some additional allowance). The plan for dismissing refugees in May has not yet been decided and will be discussed and decided at today's Board of Directors meeting.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Baudesch Departure from Shanghai Yesterday to Return to His Country for Recuperation; This Trip is Solely for Rest; Acting Consul General Inspected the Police Force Yesterday</h3>
<p>French Consul General to Shanghai, Baudesch, has served in Shanghai for many years and has achieved remarkable accomplishments. He is now suffering from accumulated fatigue and urgently needs rest. He originally intended to request leave to return to his country earlier, but his departure was delayed due to waiting to meet with the French Ambassador. He finally boarded the French Mail Steamship Company's "Fleix Roussel" at 4:00 PM yesterday and departed Shanghai to return to his country. The French Army Commander in Shanghai, Aesu Fu Eugene, the acting consul general, and senior consulate officials, including Burke, all went to the wharf to see him off. Annamite police and a band also formed a guard of honor to respectfully send him off at the wharf. Baudesch is nearly sixty years old, and his hair is already gray. Due to his sickly condition, his face is thin. After inspecting the guard of honor at the wharf, Baudesch shook hands with each of the well-wishers to express his thanks, and then, amid the music, boarded a small boat pre-docked at the wharf and departed. It is reported that Baudesch's return to his country this time is purely for rest and recuperation, and there are no other tasks. It is said that he is scheduled to return to Shanghai in three months. There is also speculation that he will be appointed as an ambassador in another location. As for the duties of the Consul General in Shanghai during his absence, they will be handled by Eugene.</p>
<p>Acting Consul General Eugene Inspects the Police Force Yesterday morning (the 7th) at 10:00 AM, the French Concession Police Department held an inspection ceremony at the Gujiazhai Garden, commanded by the Chief Inspector of the French Police, Pu Lan. The teams participating in the inspection included the French Police Band, six Annamite police squads, and two Russian police squads. Each Annamite police squad was accompanied by four machine gun vehicles, commanded by Chief Inspectors Mei Shankequ YU and Inspectors Mabeige, Buquege, Aila, and Magelong. The Russian squad was commanded by Lieutenant Aitema, and was accompanied by sixteen armored vehicles with machine guns and ten armed motorcycles.</p>
<p>Awarding of Medals</p>
<p>When French Consul General Eugene and French Consul Dihuai arrived, they were welcomed into the venue by Major Faber, the head of the French Police Department, amidst the melodious music. After Consul General Eugene completed the inspection, he proceeded to award medals to meritorious personnel of the police force. Among the award recipients was Detective Jia Yu from the Western Precinct, for repeatedly handling dangerous items such as a large number of bombs in various circumstances. Also, Inspector Malun from the Western Precinct was awarded a medal for bravely capturing thieves despite difficulties. Other award recipients included Chinese Constable No. 703, Western Detective Nog, and Russian Constable Poluotuogaosiji, all of whom were awarded medals by their superiors for their meritorious service in capturing thieves. After the awards were presented, the entire force departed from Route Lafayette, marched along Route Massenet, Route Joffre, and Route Paulun, and then dispersed after completing a circuit.</p>
<p>A Moment of Great Splendor</p>
<p>Among those who attended the inspection ceremony yesterday morning were French Army Commander in China, Major Aisu Qiai Aerti Ge, Lieutenant Colonel Luo Pinghai, as well as military officers from various countries stationed in Shanghai, including the head of the Public Concession Police Department, Baona, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council, Bolei Di, and the Deputy Director, Tai Gudi. They gathered together in great numbers, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Radio Wave Warfare: Eagerly Awaiting Cessation</h3>
<p>The Gospel Broadcasting Station of the Shanghai YMCA (call sign XMHD, address 128 Museum Road) has been suffering from strong radio wave interference. Unexpectedly, it was again disturbed starting the night before last. The cause of the disturbance may be due to the North China Daily News, an English newspaper, borrowing time for news reports at 9:00 PM. However, various religious and other programs before and after the news reports were also affected. Residents of this city who enjoy listening to religious broadcasts all hope that this "radio wave warfare" can be stopped as soon as possible so that they can once again listen to hymns and teachings.</p>
<h3>Automobile Wireless Radios Shipped to Hong Kong: Import Prohibited</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the Hong Kong government has been engaged in various wartime measures. A reporter from the Da Guang News Agency learned yesterday from transportation industry sources that the Commissioner of Trade Control in Hong Kong recently issued a decree prohibiting the import of automobiles and wireless radios. This includes the engines and chassis of automobiles. Therefore, recent shipments of these items have been forced to return to Shanghai. According to the regulations, the following conditions must be met for import: (A) The consignment note must state that the goods are being shipped outside of Hong Kong. (B) The goods must be in transit or transferred from one ship to another for shipment outside of Hong Kong. (C) If the goods can be packaged, they must be packed in sturdy boxes. (D) A detailed list of the goods must be submitted to the Commissioner of Trade Control before departure. (E) If the goods are transferred from one ship to another, a detailed list of the goods must also be submitted to the Commissioner of Trade Control before departure. Fortunately, the relevant industries are paying close attention to avoid losses.</p>

<h3>Resumption of Work at the British United Shipyards; General Wage Increase of 15%; Amendment of the Agreement; Dismissed Workers to Receive Severance Pay</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 workers at the Great Union Shipyards (i.e., the British-owned Ruirong, Yesong, Xiangsheng, Hefeng, United Shipyards) went on strike starting on March 14th of this year due to the factory's failure to fulfill the agreement of December 6, 1939. Mediation by the Municipal Council was ineffective, resulting in a stalemate. Recently, through the efforts of Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section, a complete resolution has been reached. The employer has now increased wages by 15% in accordance with the original wages, continued to recognize the union's subsidy of 100 yuan per month for loyalty fees, permanently dismissed more than 40 workers, and issued severance pay. Other improvements have been amended and announced by both parties to the agreement. All workers resumed work yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Brief Record of the Agreement</p>
<p>The British United Shipyards posted the revised labor-management agreement in the form of a notice at the entrances of each factory. A summary of the agreement is as follows: (Agreement with Workers) (1) The company recognizes the right of workers to represent the permanent fitters, lathe operators, coppersmiths, pattern makers, electricians, welders, and workshop laborers in each of the company's factories. Workers who have not been employed for a full twelve months are not entitled to the benefits stipulated in this agreement. (Bonus) (2) The company will pay a bonus to workers at the end of the year, but only if the company has dividends to distribute to shareholders. The amount of the bonus shall not be less than 10% of wages or more than 15% of wages. (Dismissal) (3) The company agrees not to dismiss any worker without just cause. Just cause refers to the following items. If any of the following reasons exist, the company has the right to dismiss workers: A. Continued business downturn for the company. B. Reduction of workers due to reorganization of various workshops in the company. C. Workers' failure to obey orders. D. Workers' commission of theft or other improper conduct. E. Workers' negligence of duty. F. Workers' repeated tardiness. G. Workers' repeated or intentional violation of company rules. (Shift Work) (4) The company may transfer workers to shift work if it deems it necessary due to a business downturn, but guarantees that workers will have at least twelve days of work out of every twenty-eight days, and will continue to be paid during the shift period. However, if workers work elsewhere during the shift period, the company will not provide a subsidy. Workers on shifts must report to the company's accounting department between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM to collect the subsidy voucher. If the unfavorable business conditions continue to extend, the company has the right to dismiss workers.</p>
<p>Dismissal Allowance</p>
<p>If dismissal must be implemented, the company shall pay a dismissal allowance, the amount of which is as follows: Those who have worked for one year or more but less than three years will receive 25 days' wages. Those who have worked for three years or more but less than five years will receive 35 days' wages. Those who have worked for 30 years or more but less than 40 years will receive 125 days' wages. The company shall give two weeks' notice if it wishes to dismiss a worker, but this method shall be subject to the circumstances at the time. (Holidays) (5) Annual holidays are set at ten days. (Accident and Injury Allowance) (6) If a worker is injured while performing his duties, the company shall pay for medical expenses and continue to pay his wages and subsidies for three months during the treatment period. If the worker has not recovered after three months or becomes permanently disabled, the company shall provide compensation and severance pay based on the worker's years of service, with a maximum amount of 350 yuan. If a worker dies or dies from serious injuries due to an accident while performing his duties, the nearest relative will receive a pension, with a maximum amount of 450 yuan. If a worker dies within two months due to an accident while performing his duties, in addition to medical expenses, the company shall continue to pay wages and subsidies until the date of death and provide a pension, with a maximum amount of 450 yuan.</p>
<p>Various Prohibitions</p>
<p>(Illness and Death Benefits) (Omitted) (Work Stoppage or Strike) (9) If workers are dissatisfied, they shall notify the company of the reasons and shall notify the company of the reasons 48 hours in advance. They shall not stop work without authorization. Those who strike without permission shall automatically lose the rights stipulated in this agreement. Those who intentionally damage company property or use violence to prevent others from working shall be dismissed by the company and have their due rights canceled. If a strike by one worker affects the work of other non-striking workers, the company shall not be responsible for the wages lost by those who cannot work as a result. In the event of an illegal strike, the company has the right to lock all workers out of the factory. (Subsidy) The company agrees to continue to pay all workers a subsidy of two yuan per week (six or seven working days) as the standard, based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's survey of the average weekly price of No. 1 local white rice at 30 to 40 yuan per dan, for a period of one year.

<h3>Hundreds of White Russian Youths in "Manchukuo" to Come to Shanghai; "Manchukuo" to Compel White Russians to Serve in the Military; Those Unwilling Plan to Flee to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Changchun officially announced last month that starting from January 1, 1941, all White Russian youths in "Manchukuo" must serve in compulsory military service and join the "North Manchurian Army." Therefore, it is expected that several hundred White Russians from Harbin and other cities in "Manchukuo" will flee military service and move to Shanghai this year. It is reported that the "Manchukuo" conscription law was first promulgated last year, but it was implemented on a small scale, and due to the lack of military instructors, most White Russian youths were not forced to enlist. However, the number of military instructors has recently increased, and a new order was issued last month stating that starting next year, the conscription law will be applied to all White Russian youths in "Manchukuo," and large-scale military education for White Russian youths will begin. According to White Russians who came to Shanghai from Harbin, most White Russians in that area plan to come to Shanghai. The White Russian population in this city was about 25,000 two years ago and has now increased to 50,000.</p>
<h3>Lin Yutang's Remarks in the Philippines: America Believes China Will Win; If America Imposes an Embargo, Japan Will Be Placed in a Desperate Situation; Chinese People United as Never Before</h3>
<p>The famous Chinese English literary writer Lin Yutang, along with his wife and three daughters, returned to China from the United States to welcome the final victory of the Chinese military. While passing through Manila, he made a statement to reporters, praising American public opinion and hoping for China's victory. He also noted that China's capabilities will certainly be able to achieve the final victory and drive out the invaders. After Lin arrived in Hong Kong, he stayed for a few days and then flew to Chongqing to reside for a long time. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Americans are Confident that China Will Win</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the mood of the American people has been in favor of China, and they believe that China has an equal opportunity to win the war and will ultimately achieve victory. Over the past six months, the feeling among Americans that China will ultimately win the war has grown. It is very gratifying to see the American people's sympathy for China's resistance and their belief that China has the strength to defeat the invaders.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers in China are at a Loss</p>
<p>No one can believe the words of Japanese diplomats because what they say is either insincere or contradicts what the Japanese military does. Afterwards, diplomats have to make strenuous arguments to cover up the truth. However, the Japanese are deeply at a loss on the front lines in China and cannot influence developments outside of the Far East.</p>
<p>America's Attitude has Become More Rigid</p>
<p>America's attitude towards Japan has become more rigid. It holds a potentially powerful embargo weapon that can put Japan in a deadly situation. Therefore, the Japanese are deeply afraid of the consequences of America announcing an embargo against Japan. Japan has reached the point of exhaustion in terms of manpower, and its morale and public sentiment are declining daily, while its reserves are almost depleted. China, on the other hand, has unlimited manpower, trade is proceeding as usual, and the solidarity of the people is unprecedented in Chinese history.</p>
<p>All Conspiracies Have Failed</p>
<p>The Japanese military risks approximately 40,000 casualties per month in China. This is why the Japanese military does not dare to invade Chongqing again. The Japanese are currently trying to consolidate the Chinese territories they have occupied, but they have also failed. They are trying to support puppets to consolidate the occupied areas, but puppets are still puppets. As a result, Japan has had to repeatedly send more soldiers to invade the occupied areas. Recently, one puppet even failed to gain the support of the Chinese business community in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Remittance Exchange Premiums Greatly Stabilized</h3>
<p>Profiteers Lose Their Basis</p>
<p>After August 13th, remittances could not be used to purchase foreign exchange, and the scope of transfers was limited to the financial industry in China. Among merchants, some gradually reduced the remittance of business income by one or two yuan per hundred yuan to obtain legal tender for their needs. Afterwards, the number of remittances on the market increased, and the amount of cash felt to be insufficient in return. As a result, those who collected legal tender to buy remittances for profit seized the opportunity to rise up. The exchange premium market soared. Since the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications commissioned banks to jointly adjust the legal tender needs of the money industry, the exchange premium market price has been greatly stabilized. However, since remittances can be converted into cash, as time goes by, more and more people are taking advantage of this, and the blockade of funds has thus had loopholes. The money industry's supply to customers is inherently limited to the genuine needs of importers, but it is impossible to be as strict as expected in reality. Since July 1st of last year, after the new system of strengthening remittances, the preparation committee's supply of cash withdrawals for remittances from various industries was stopped at the same time. Although speculators were still able to profit from the market slump at first, and forcibly held on, now that the commercial beliefs of the citizens have gradually recovered, and various industries have recognized the importance of fund blocking, the new remittance system is becoming more and more strengthened. The new remittances have been well received by industry and commerce. Foreign banks have already begun to accept the new remittances. The remittance payment reserve is now based on more than 100% of assets, so there will be no soaring market prices like those that occurred in April of last year, and speculators are gradually losing their base.</p>
<h3>Patrolman Loses His Mind, Shoots Driver and Passengers; Quarrel Over Prolonged Traffic Light Time; Patrolman Became Enraged and Opened Fire Indiscriminately; Four People Were Shot; The Patrolman Abandoned His Post and Fled</h3>
<p>At approximately 11:20 AM yesterday, a shooting incident occurred at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Gordon Road in the Public Concession involving a patrolman and a tram driver. As a result, two tram passengers were shot, one person was startled and fell, and the tram driver was also shot in the head and seriously injured. The patrolman lost his mind, opened fire indiscriminately for a moment, like a madman. Seeing the disaster he had caused, he abandoned his gun, took off his uniform, and fled without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Patrolman Obstructs</p>
<p>At approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, a tram on Route 1, driven by driver No. 119, was traveling east from Jing'an Temple. When it passed the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Edward VII, the patrolman No. 2618, who was in charge of the traffic lights, did not turn on the green light for a long time, causing the tram to be unable to move forward. At that time, the driver, He Dengshan (26 years old, from Nantong), believed that the tram had a company-regulated time schedule for each run, so he was very dissatisfied and spoke rudely. The patrolman was also young and hot-tempered, so he stepped forward and angrily slapped He's face. The matter was resolved after passengers and passersby persuaded them to stop.</p>
<p>Opening Fire Indiscriminately</p>
<p>At approximately 11:20 AM, when the tram returned to the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Edward VII from the Bund, the two first glared at each other, and then a quarrel broke out. The patrolman tried to drag He out of the tram, and He angrily said, "Dare you shoot me?" Before he could finish speaking, the patrolman ignored the consequences and pulled out his gun, firing four shots at He and the front of the tram. Amid the sound of gunfire, He was the first to be hit, and a bullet hit his head. At the same time, two passengers standing on the platform, Hu Mingyi (18 years old, from Jiangxi Jiang) and Wu Liangen (also known as Liquan, 22 years old), were also hit. Hu was shot in the chest, and Wu was shot in the right shoulder, both collapsing in a pool of blood. In addition, an old man, Ye Xuanji (63 years old, from Wujin), was too frightened and fell out of the tram, breaking his leg.</p>
<p>Abandoning His Post and Fleeing</p>
<p>For a moment, passersby did not understand the truth and thought that there was a robbery and the police were shooting, so they rushed to avoid the scene, causing great confusion. The Chinese patrolman who committed the crime saw the disaster he had caused, quickly took off his uniform, and escaped without a trace while the opportunity presented itself. Afterwards, the police received the news and sent officers to the scene to transport the injured to the Bao Long Hospital for treatment. They also launched a strict search for the patrolman. It is reported that the police found the gun that the patrolman had been carrying in a trash can somewhere on Tianzhu Road within an hour after the incident.</p>
<h3>A Large Sum of Money Robbed from the Hua Feng Bank</h3>
<p>Also Affected Was the Old Accountant of Yuan Heng Trading Company</p>
<p>Loss of 4,500 Yuan</p>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly entered the Huafeng Silver House, No. 304 Guohua Bank Building, Beijing Road, Henan Road, Public Concession. They were all well-dressed and impersonated customers, inquiring about the procedures for remitting money to Wuxi. At that time, the old accountant of Yuan Heng Trading Company, Yin Yongxiang (from Zhenjiang), No. 60 Henan Road, had just received 5,500 yuan in cash from the Yuanrun Sheng Trading Company, which was attached to the bank, and was in the process of counting the money. Of that amount, 1,000 yuan had already been placed by Yin in a bag, and the remaining 4,500 yuan was placed on the counter, ready to be counted again. The three robbers saw this and immediately took out guns, robbing Yin of all 4,500 yuan that he had placed out. Still not satisfied, they jumped into the counter and tied up Zhou and four other Hua Feng employees to chairs. One robber stood guard, and another 4,000 yuan was robbed. The robbers then fled, carrying their loot. After the police received the news, they rushed to the scene to search for the robbers. However, the robbers had already vanished like yellow cranes. The police have now issued a strict order for a thorough investigation in order to bring them to justice, as the robbers dared to commit robbery of a large sum of money in broad daylight in a busy downtown area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Carrier Exports; Destination Unknown</h3>
<p>American Ships Luzon and Guam</p>
<p>Exported the Day Before Yesterday, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy's small aircraft carrier Chiyoda entered port on the 1st of this month, moored at the 11th and 12th pontoons. On the day before yesterday (the 6th) at about 11:00 AM, it moved to the Mitsubishi Wharf on the north side of the Garden Bridge. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the ship suddenly left Shanghai yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, and its destination is unknown. It is reported that the ship's displacement is only 5,000-6,000 tons, and only seven or eight aircraft can be parked on the deck. The capacity of the cabin is probably not large either, so it is definitely a small one. In addition, the two American Navy's Yangtze River gunboats, the Luzon and Guam, which had been in Shanghai for almost a month, suddenly left Shanghai for export on the 6th. However, at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the two ships suddenly returned to Shanghai one after the other and are still moored at the American Navy pontoon on the Yangjingbang shore.</p>
<h3>The Kidnapping Case of Feng and Li Remains Unresolved to This Day</h3>
<p>Definitely a Mistaken Kidnapping Since They Are Not Wealthy</p>
<p>The kidnapping case of Feng Yunjii, director of the tobacco leaf department, and Li Zhitang, director of the cigarette packaging department, of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, which occurred on Yu Yuan Road the day before yesterday (the 2nd), remains unresolved to this day. Reporters visited their families separately. According to them, Feng and Li have both been working at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company for many years, working hard and diligently. They have been promoted from small employees earning 30 yuan a month to the position of director. However, their position in the company is only that of middle-level employees, and their monthly income is only enough to feed their families. Feng and Li are colleagues with equal positions, and their family situations are about the same. It is difficult to guess what the purpose of the kidnapping is. Since the two men are not wealthy and usually focus on company business and do not ask about other external affairs, it is certain that this kidnapping was a mistaken kidnapping.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>Jiang Jinkang, a Yongbo native, 36 years old, an employee of the Deli Chicken and Duck Company at No. 728 Baylor Road, embezzled 1,600 yuan in account funds over a period of four days from the 17th to the 20th of last month. Recently, he was discovered by Shen Afang (34 years old, Yongbo native), a shareholder and manager of the company, who reported it to the French police. Jiang was arrested and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court. Yesterday morning, Sun Penghian, the judge in charge, concluded the trial and sentenced Jiang Jinkang to four months of imprisonment for business embezzlement as a warning.</p>
<p>He Ermei, a 25-year-old unmarried woman from Jiangyin, residing at No. 31 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, has recently been spending time wandering around with her neighboring sisters and returning home late at night.

She was discovered by her family at 11:00 AM at noon, but it was too late to save her.</p>
<p>Wang Xingsheng, a local, 42 years old, specializes in selling vegetables. He lives in Wangjiabang, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. At about 7:00 PM on the night before last, when Wang and his wife were having dinner at home, four young men, each holding a handgun, suddenly broke into the room. Without asking any questions, they kidnapped Wang Xingsheng. His wife chased him out the door, and the men fired two shots at her. Fortunately, she was not injured. It is reported that Wang's kidnapping is related to the controlled goods in the Western Shanghai area.</p>

<h3>Nationally Produced Seasoning with a Certified Seal of Authenticity</h3>
<p>Seasoning powder is a necessity for daily use. However, some manufacturers of seasoning powder often cut corners, produce inferior goods, or even change labels to deceive the people, which is harmful to health. This is no small matter. The Shanghai National Seasoning Powder Manufacturers Association has specially obtained approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to print national product certification seals. Starting from March 1st, these seals will be distributed to member factories to be affixed to each product. In addition to the Ministry's order to overseas embassies and consulates, as well as domestic customs offices and anti-smuggling agencies, to conduct strict inspections, the association will also conduct thorough inspections and detailed chemical tests. Any products that do not meet the standard ingredients will not be allowed to be released, in order to maintain the reputation of national seasoning products. Those unscrupulous people who impersonate national products will have no way to use their skills from now on.</p>

<h3>Finance: The British Pound Plunges in New York, with Especially Heavy Selling from the Far East; The US Dollar in Hong Kong is Unstable; the Exchange Rate Between the US Dollar and Shanghai Currency has Rebounded</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listing showed a sharp contraction of six points in the morning exchange rate. The Shanghai US dollar exchange rate was quoted at 125, which is 4.375 yuan. The British pound exchange rate remained unchanged, and other exchange rates also softened slightly. The domestic situation continued to be stable. However, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate, it resulted in a state of a strong British pound and a soft US dollar. The whole day's process had few twists and turns. Initially, Hong Kong Telegraph's supply was blocked, and Japanese banks also sought sales in the market. The potential trend was quite loose for a while, and the strongest price once reached 3.34375. At noon, speculators settled aggressively, and the price rebounded again. The market situation was still calm in the later market. In the afternoon, speculators still came to search for purchases. Thanks to the continuous sales of US banks, supply and demand were offset, and the market was very stable. The closing price also remained unchanged. As a result, the British gold price was 3.2125, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.6875, which was higher than the previous day's British gold price by 0.03125, and the US dollar exchange rate was tighter by 0.0625. The futures and spot prices were slightly squeezed.</p>
<p>Looking at the New York exchange rate as an observation, a telegram on the 6th stated that the price of the British pound had plummeted, and the selling pressure was very strong, especially from the Far East. The Hong Kong US dollar exchange rate was also volatile, while the New York exchange rate for Shanghai's legal tender has rebounded from 4.75 yuan to 4.8 yuan. The future trend of international exchange rates is also worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Sell US Dollars</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's long-term and short-term interest rates were flat, New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold remained stagnant. The British pound exchange rate against the US dollar did not move, the exchange rate against Shanghai's legal tender was up 0.125, and the exchange rate against the French franc remained unchanged. The US dollar exchange rate against the British pound contracted by 0.0625, the exchange rate against Shanghai's legal tender was up 0.05, and the exchange rate against the French franc fell by 0.035. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 3.28125 for British gold and 4.65625 yuan for the US dollar exchange rate, which was flat for British gold and tighter by 0.09375 for the US dollar exchange rate compared to the previous night's closing prices, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate. Shortly after the opening, Hong Kong Telegraph came to sell, and the price started to loosen. Hong Kong Telegraph sold spot British gold to foreign banks for 3.3125, and the spot US dollar exchange rate traded at 4.6875. HSBC's listing was announced, with the British pound exchange rate unchanged and the US dollar exchange rate slightly tighter by 0.125, at 4.375 yuan. The silver balance tax was announced with no change. Later, Japanese banks also sold, and foreign banks' appetite was very weak, with a full supply intention, resulting in a faster loosening of the market. In May, Japanese banks sold US dollars at 4.4375. At times, the spot British gold price was seen at a maximum of 3.34375, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.75 yuan. Speculators sold US dollars for May delivery to foreign banks at 4.5 yuan. At noon, speculators suddenly started buying, and the market rebounded. The closing prices were 3.28125 for British gold and 4.65625 yuan for the US dollar exchange rate, which were the same as the opening prices in the morning. The futures and spot prices were slightly squeezed.</p>
<p>Strong Supply from US Merchants</p>
<p>Although Chinese merchants and speculators frequently settled in the afternoon, the market situation remained stable due to the strong supply from US banks. Transactions were made, including May US dollars, with speculators absorbing from 4.4375 yuan to 4.5 yuan. The evening closing still showed hardening. As a result, the British gold price was 3.3125, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.6875. The British gold price for this month was 3.15625, and the US dollar exchange rate was 4.4375. Compared to the previous night's spot closing price, the British gold price rose slightly by 0.03125, while the US dollar exchange rate tightened by 0.0625.

<h3>Gold Market Lingers, Not Yet Free From Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cash dark market conditions showed that people's confidence was strong, and the rising atmosphere was still thick. Although it rose and then fell, the result continued to trend upward. The opening in the morning was good at 11 yuan. Then, the gold shop first entered, and for a time, there was a great lack of sellers. It was then raised to 7,100 yuan. Later, due to the loose foreign exchange market, it was inevitable to cause floating accounts to sell off. Securities and money exchange firms sold strongly, causing it to be pressed into the 7,000 yuan range. The lowest was reported at 6,970 yuan. Until around 11:00 AM, the exchange market rebounded. A certain gold shop and securities gangs competed to buy, and under the atmosphere of buying pressure, the surface market broke through 7,100 yuan, seeing a high price of 7,140 yuan. However, the noon closing was only 7,080 yuan. The gold shops searched for purchases without lagging behind. Unexpectedly, it was suppressed by the securities gangs and gold shops, falling to 7,025 yuan. Before the close, the silver shop gangs scooped up some, and the result was still reported at 7,060 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan from the previous day. The whole day's trading went from prosperous to clear, with a transaction volume of more than 3,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold first fell and then returned to flat. The customs gold price remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Red Increased by 50 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning in the morning, although the exchange rate fell sharply, the Shanghai US dollar exchange rate tightened and then rebounded slightly. Therefore, there were still sellers when it opened, and it was only slightly raised by 10 yuan. The silver shop sold to the jewelry gang for 7,020 yuan per 10 taels. Later, due to the gold shops seeing the low and searching for purchases, it immediately rose by 80 yuan. The silver shop sold to the securities gang for 7,100 yuan for 20 taels. However, there were many limit-priced sellers at the above price, and the rise was blocked. A certain money exchange company suddenly came to sell, and it immediately turned downward. Soon after, a certain securities gang and gold shop followed suit, and the foreign exchange market was still reporting loosening. The buyers fell short, and they actually retreated into the 7,000 yuan range. The securities gang sold to the gold shop for 6,970 yuan for 20 taels. After that, the sellers gradually decreased, and the gold shops absorbed slightly. The market situation stabilized, and they immediately returned to over 7,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, a rising wind suddenly started around 11:00 AM. The gold shop and another securities gang competed to buy, and the foreign exchange market tightened. Retail investors saw the scene and rushed to buy. In an instant, it soared by more than 100 yuan. The gold shop bought from the money exchange company for 7,140 yuan for 10 taels. At noon, the buying wind subsided slightly, and the gold shop sold again, falling back by 60 yuan. The gold shop sold to the silver shop for 7,080 yuan for 20 taels as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the sentiment was quite good, opening high by 40 yuan. The silver shop bought from the gold shop for 7,120 yuan for 10 taels. Later, a certain gold shop sold, and it immediately fell back by a small amount of 40 yuan. The gold shop sold to the money exchange company for 7,080 yuan for 10 taels. Then, the silver shop came to buy again, regaining 20 yuan. The gold shop bought from the securities gang for 7,100 yuan for 20 taels. The reason for the certain securities gang, the gold shop doing long positions came to short sell, and the exchange market reported being hard, a lack of buyers, and it fell by 75 yuan. The money exchange company sold to the silver shop for 7,025 yuan for 20 taels. After entering, the silver shop saw it cheap and scooped it up, and it went up again. The gold shops did 30 taels, and the evening closing price was 7,060 yuan. As a result, it rose by 50 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for seven consecutive days, a total of 1,488 yuan. The whole day's ups and downs totaled 170 yuan. The current spot gold selling price of the gold shops, at premium, is more than ten yuan higher. The receiving price is reduced by 30 yuan.

<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation showed that there was still no lack of demand for British and American gold pounds. The market prices consistently continued to rise by one yuan. In the morning, the supply and demand for British gold notes were even. In the afternoon, the black market British exchange rate trended downward, so it finally fell by one yuan. The American gold notes started high at 21.78 yuan in the early morning due to the British pound price plummeting by 0.0625. Later, it retreated to 20.09 yuan. The noon closing was 21.2 yuan. The afternoon situation was very stable. The evening market was 21.1 yuan. As a result, there was no difference compared to the previous day. There was quite a need for Hong Kong notes in the morning. The market price rose slightly. In the afternoon, it gradually returned to flat. There was a slight demand for French franc notes, and the price rose by one cent. There was a sudden supply of Annam notes, and the market trended downward. The same industry slightly needed ruble notes, and the price rose slightly. Canadian notes fell back by 0.5 yuan. The trend of Japanese gold notes was slightly firm. The evening market price was 1.277 yuan. There was a demand for Korean notes, and the evening market retreated to 0.995 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stock Transactions Lively, Domestic Bonds Little Trading</h3>
<p>The securities dark market situation yesterday was still a circling with a tired state. Transactions were still not vigorous. Customers continued to have spot goods flowing out. Buyers were weak, and most were making small, covering buys. Domestic warfare held, and foreign countries were gradually changing. Public bonds were being hit at any time. The prospects were difficult to be optimistic about. The high interest was weighing on them, and they were hesitant. The exchange rate arbitrage interest was generous, so they abandoned this and took that, so it became even more deserted. Yesterday's buying and selling were still dominated by more sellers and fewer buyers, or exchanging C to D, to take advantage of the surplus after the lottery, or exchanging D to C, hoping to win the lottery. Each had their own desires, which had exceeded the usual speculative position. The changes were still to come. As a result, the market prices, except for type A, remained unchanged, and the rest were slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 30 shares of Dasheng's third share were traded at a price of 30 yuan.</p>
<p>When the Zhongye stock market opened, although there was no selling pressure, the potential trend was slightly soft. Most of the prices were generally slightly lower than the previous closing price. In the first hour, it seemed that there was a continued decline. Later, due to people's confidence rebounding, prices were able to be supported. Although the trading volume was not bad, the activity seemed to have decreased slightly. There was nothing particularly noteworthy about the buyers' interest. Among the real estate stocks, Zhonghe shares had the highest demand, and the price jumped sharply from 22.5 yuan at the opening to 24.75 yuan at the closing. Buyers were still not satisfied at this price. The opposite of Yeguang shares fell several cents, closing at 16.7 yuan, while the previous closing was 17.2 yuan. 29,500 shares of Shanghai Enterprise shares were traded, and the appreciation was thus. The price was bought from 8.35 yuan at the opening to 8 yuan at the closing. The glory of the English Allied shares was not exhausted, and 44,400 shares were traded. The opening price was 73 yuan for buying and 73.5 yuan for selling. It once fell to a low of 70.5 yuan, and then recovered to 72 yuan at the closing.</p>
<p>Although the price of rubber shares fell, there were still many people who needed them. Lange Zhi Zaihui was most affected by the back wind, and the price fell from 47 yuan at the opening to 45.5 yuan for buying and 45.75 yuan for selling. Yingzhahua also fell by 2 yuan, and Rubber Trust retreated by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. Each stock has buyer interest to maintain, so the situation cannot be said to be bad.</p>
<p>London, July 6 (Monday) - Today's listing market for Chinese foreign debt showed that the reorganization loan and the English issue of the qian bond fell by 1.5 pounds, and the price was 33.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, July 6 (Monday) - Today's listing market for the stocks of British Far East companies showed that the Gula Ke Lin Pang rubber shares fell back by 3 pence, and the price was 18 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Enterprise Issues New Shares</h3>
<p>The total amount of shares of Ying Shang Shanghai Enterprise Co., Ltd. is 1 million shares, with each share worth 5 yuan of national currency. The total capital is 5 million yuan of national currency. In addition to the 370,000 shares already issued, which are worth 1.85 million yuan of national currency, the board of directors has now resolved to issue 555,000 shares from the 630,000 unissued shares. The issue price per share is 5.5 yuan of national currency. It is stipulated that 2 old shares can subscribe for 131 new shares. The full amount of shares must be paid to HSBC before May 15th. All shareholders registered on May 10th have the right to apply for subscription.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Bulls Already Selling Off, Yarn Market Turning to Mild, Real Sales Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>The yarn market has started to rise, then returned, and the trend has become slightly milder. However, most people still see it as good, so as soon as the market price loosens, buyers will come one after another. As for the real sales level, large transactions are very lacking. Only Hong Kong takes the lead in scattered purchases, one after another.</p>
<p>Due to the good sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day, the market continued to advance for spot yarn in the morning. The single price of 20s Shuangma Factory was 1,705 yuan. Later, it was reported that the foreign exchange rate had increased slightly, and the gold price was calm. Many parties were selling again, and the market situation was relatively relaxed, falling to 1,680 yuan. After the closing, it rebounded slightly. The transaction statistics for half a day were 1,790 packages. The quotation for 20s Shuangma increased by 12 yuan. The amount purchased by each bang mouth is listed as follows: Same Industry 1,070, Hong Kong 550, Mainland 125, Nanhai 30, Ningbo 15. Total 1,790.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Improves</h3>
<p>The domestic cotton market has already shown signs of improvement. Chinese factories have some demand, so people's confidence is firm. Same industry transactions are still as lively as ever, so the market is stable. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below: Da Zhong Ji 200.00, Xin Yu Jin 100 packages, Pingguo Er 126.00, Same Industry Jin 300 pieces, Xia He Da 33.00, Rong Feng Jin 218 pieces, Da Zhong Ji 300.00, Same Industry Jin 90 pieces, Pila 280.00, Same Industry Jin 200 pieces, Peng Jia Pu 302.50, Same Industry Jin 50 pieces, Mail Bag Cotton 333.00, Xin Sheng Jin 184 packages, Mite Lin 350.00, 340.00, Cheng Fu Jin 64 pieces.</p>
<p>In addition, the market price of foreign cotton, due to the selling pressure from all parties in the New York cotton market yesterday, and then due to the short selling and long selling of the South, the closing price was 10 points lower for the near term and 14-15 points lower for the far term. India fell 3 rupees, including the forecast. Egypt was closed.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai yesterday turned active again. The Tianjin gang had a strong buying intention, and a certain factory also had a slight appetite yesterday. As a result, the same industry was quite excited. In fact, the current inventory in the market is very thin, and the selling price is 30-40 yuan lower than that of foreign firms. However, I am afraid that the spot price will still catch up with the futures selling price in a few days. The factory price converted to US dollars at 4.625 yuan is as follows: 20s American Mite Lin 374.50, 20s Sub-Grade 306.20, 32s 399.70, 32s Sub-Grade 385.00, 42s 402.60, 42s Sub-Grade 398.20.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Prices Slightly Flat - Prices Have Been Announced -</h3>
<p>The rice market was still flat and tired yesterday, because the market changes were too strong, and buyers did not dare to buy rashly. The sales market was very weak at the beginning of the morning, and the selling wind was strong. They all took small transactions as a game, and the shouts fell, step by step, near yuan. It opened at 48.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, when this price came out, the general floating national retail investors immediately pulled in, and the mutual echoes and shouts rose one after another. In a moment, it returned one yuan, and the small grain was restored to 49.5 yuan. However, the real sales were limited, and half of them were mental transactions, which were difficult to keep. It was still depreciated by half a yuan. After that, it wandered all the way, often in and out around this price, and finally closed at 49 yuan. Other goods, such as Saigon and Siamese, were more stable due to more real sales. The market only fluctuated by 0.5 yuan throughout the market. Only broken rice and rice green had even supply and demand, and the selling prices were similar.</p>
<p>The rumors about thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice spread outside the market, so they were also depressed. The Wuxi Qing special japonica rice has opened at 51.5 yuan, the powdered embryo is 49 yuan, the Qingsi thin rice and the Nanhai early and late rice are all high from 49.2 yuan, and the decision is made to 48 yuan. Although glutinous rice is a seasonal product in demand, the sales are not widespread, and the goods are crowded in the warehouse, resulting in cheap goods and low prices, and it cannot be supported by low prices, and it can be seen that it has fallen by one yuan. The selling price of Jinli Special Yuan is 42.5 yuan, 42 yuan, the Chang Dan Gao Yuan is 41.4 yuan, and the second to the tide soft is 38-39 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the gradual flattening of foreign exchange rates, the interest of speculators in foreign rice has gradually faded, and profitable bulls have competed to sell, so market prices have been difficult to maintain. The current rice is particularly tired, especially Siamese, because there is still a ship of 2,800 tons arriving in port on the 9th tomorrow, and people are very worried. For example, the early and late market opening prices of No. 2 Siamese were 49 yuan, and in the afternoon, they fell to 47.5-47.6 yuan. The slightly inferior ones only opened at 47.1 yuan, which was more than 1.5 yuan smaller. The afternoon closing of No. 2 Saigon Small Grain was smaller than the early market yuan, but the owners of the original packaged return No. 2 Saigon goods insisted very strongly, and the downward trend was slower. The original root settlement price for the first period of May still opened at 60 yuan, and the market opened at 59.3-59.5 yuan, which has arrived from 59.2-58.7 yuan. A total of more than 400 tons were sold, and more than 6,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Noodles Sold to Southeast Asia, Local Noodle Shops Requesting Fair Prices, Flour Mills Still Say Not Enough Cost</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was fixed and firm. The No. 2 flour mill's price was still 14 yuan, and the customer price was still as high as 15 yuan. This was because the sales of Nan Yang powder in the daily market suddenly moved, and someone was purchasing it in Shanghai. Both rice and noodles were being shipped, so people's hearts were better. The price of the return goods Lao Che brand was two to three cents higher than the factory price, and those who held them still regarded them as rare goods. Inland flour was also the same, so the current retail price of each bag in various flour shops ranges from 14.2-4 yuan. It is said that the machine-cut noodle industry is filing a request to suppress the price of flour. According to the factory's news, the raw materials are expensive, and the wholesale price in this street is still maintained. However, the price of rice has already fallen yesterday and today. If the price of four bags of flour is calculated at one stone of rice, the price of flour is already higher than the price of rice. It is also said that the sales of inland flour are not weak. For example, Shunfeng brand opened at 14.3 yuan yesterday, which was 5 points harder than the previous day. The wheat market still persisted because the factory wanted to suppress the price.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybean Cake Sales Season Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil cake market situation went in opposite directions, soybean oil supply and demand were not equal, and it continued to fall outside the yuan. Peanut oil market prices rose and fell unevenly. However, the soybean cake sales market was booming and flourishing. People's hearts were quite lively, and market prices often rose. Yesterday, each cake was raised by two, three, or four cents. It is estimated that there were more than enough factory four cake and 2,000 slices that were bought from the chemical gang, and the price was 11.7 yuan. The mainland group stomach distributed seven carts of Changzhou Yuanlong cake (620 slices per cart), and the price was 10.08 yuan. The Shantou gang asked for 2,000 slices of Yantai cake, and the price was 10.02 yuan. More than 15,000 slices of Sipai cake, the price was 10.08 or 10.075 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, 200 bags of yellow soybeans were shipped from Qingdao yesterday (7th), with 690 pieces of soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diao Qing Rose by Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend turned flat. The association's planning prices were: 24 crude white, this warehouse goods were 76.7 yuan, foreign warehouse new goods were 76.7-76.5 yuan, old goods were 76.3-76.2 yuan, transshipment goods were 60 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark 487 yuan, and the large ones were 86.5 yuan, which can be obtained. This warehouse was 66.7 yuan, transshipment was 55.5 yuan, H mark car red was 63 yuan, and the rest lacked changes. 300 foreign packages of Guotang Diao Qing were transacted yesterday, and the price was 62-62.7 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous (2nd). Dozens of pieces of Tiao Qing were still 52 yuan. It was heard that Xinghua Qing was 470 yuan, but it was too far away.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Golden Daylily Also Subject to Control, How Can Market Prices Be Cheap?</h3>
<p>Golden daylilies have always been traded through remittance and transfer. Recently, the premium has exceeded 200 yuan outside the customs. Although it has slightly recovered recently, the source is still subject to control by a certain market, so external expenses have increased sharply, and the cost is even higher. Currently, sales have also become active, and the trend is quite strong. According to production news, this year's new goods must be marked at 50 yuan, so everyone is unanimously optimistic. It is reported that a batch of Guangbang's top-grade vegetables was 55 yuan the day before, and even the prices of regular goods have risen sharply in recent days. It is estimated that more than 70 bags from Zhongxing Suqian were 48 yuan, Daxing vegetables were 52 yuan, and Gaoxiangzhuang was 53.5 yuan. It is said that the price will increase by 10 yuan before and after.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Tea Market Opening</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the new green tea produced and sold by foreign firms, the manufacturers have put one or twenty new samples on the market. Yesterday, more than one hundred boxes of fine tea leaves were collected by Xiehe, Shihe, Jinlong and other firms, with prices ranging from 430 yuan to 460 yuan. According to the cost estimate of the merchants, all of them will inevitably suffer losses, and the situation is slightly unprofitable. It is reported that most of the new and old goods recently purchased by various firms are for export on the Italian postal ship "Contro Rosso". At this time of the Mediterranean war, both Chinese and foreign tea merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<h3>A Letter to All Shanghai Students from the University and Middle School Student Association</h3>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>Second, we must use the program of resistance and national reconstruction as our goal of hard struggle.</p>
<p>Reading is of course our basic work, but our hard struggle must also have a definite goal. Otherwise, we will easily be tempted and shaken, and there will be the danger of blindly following others. We know that China's only way out now is to resist to the end. Of course, we oppose any peace compromise. However, long-term resistance is indeed a very difficult and arduous task. Because the purpose of this resistance is not only to resist Japanese aggression. We are not only engaged in resistance, but also actively engaged in national reconstruction, establishing a new country of freedom and equality. Therefore, resistance and national reconstruction are progressing simultaneously. To achieve the goal of winning the resistance and succeeding in national reconstruction, the first thing we must do is strengthen our self-esteem and self-confidence. Young people are the pillars of the country, and we should especially strengthen our</p>
<p>belief in resistance.</p>
<p>Leading the people to participate in the work of resistance and national reconstruction. However, as I said before, studying hard is saving the country. This means that we students must engage in saving the country through our basic work. In other words, we must do appropriate extracurricular activities. We must be a model for the people and hold an absolutely optimistic attitude towards the country. We must clearly recognize our goal: the purpose of long-term resistance is to build a new China of independence, freedom, and the Three Principles of the People. Compromise along the way is suicide. Therefore, we oppose the deceptive peace of surrender to the people. We must eliminate the small number of wavering elements in our ranks. Of course, we also hope that they will have a final awakening and be able to abandon evil and return to righteousness and participate in the work of resistance and national reconstruction together. We must clearly recognize that this resistance is the</p>
<p>only way</p>
<p>for the Chinese nation to strive for independence, freedom, and equality. The responsibility of saving the country must be shouldered by everyone. This time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also made it clear to us at the Fifth National Political Council, "No matter how difficult the environment of resistance has been in the past two years, the national policy of resistance has always been firm." The reason why the national policy of resistance can be so firm is because the people of the whole country have consistently supported the program of resistance and national reconstruction. We students have the most glorious history in the past, so when it comes to such a great festival, we cannot but encourage each other. Most importantly, we must clearly judge right and wrong and distinguish between good and evil.</p>

<h3>The 10th Public Exhibition Handball Championship Already in the Grasp of Zhongqing; Three Doubles Matches Won Last Night; Tonight's Outcome is Irrelevant</h3>
<p>After the tenth Public Exhibition Cup handball competition, with both the Chinese and Western sides each winning one round, the final decisive round has resulted in a difficult-to-resolve balanced situation. The acquisition or loss of the championship therefore depended on the five doubles matches that began last night. The Zhongqing side, recognizing the seriousness of the situation and the need to deploy unconventional tactics in order to win, decided to bring up Jiang Jiadu and Sun Jialu from the student ranks and replace Gao Zisan of the fifth group and Cheng Zunhua of the third group. Their strength has thus become even more formidable. Zhongqing is determined to win. In last night's three matches, apart from the extremely tense situation in the fourth group, the fifth and third groups won with overwhelming momentum, each winning in straight sets. Currently, Zhongqing has won the third round with an 8-5 victory. In the overall results, they have triumphed with a 2-1 victory. The championship is already within their grasp. There are still two main group battles tonight, but the outcome is irrelevant.</p>

The old members, the German team and the Waterworks team, have withdrawn. The Jewish Club has joined as a new team. The Group A competition is scheduled to begin on the 19th of next month, and the Group B competition will begin earlier, on the 5th of next month. The team lists are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Spring Welcoming Ritual (2)</h3>
<p>The Spring Official is usually played by a beggar, as no one is willing to take on this arduous task. The Mang God previously had a pair of glass lamp fixtures, followed by several pairs of lamp fixtures with gold characters on blue gauze. Behind him were dozens of people from various government offices, beating gongs and drums with loud shouts. Finally, incense smoke swirled around, with people carrying incense burners and incense trays walking in unison. At the very end was a gilded vermilion lacquer shrine, representing the arrival of Tai Sui. In front of the shrine were three or four layers of candle stands, filled with burning candles. The candles that had burned in front of the god were known as "yuanbao" (silver ingots) in the vernacular, and people competed to buy large candles to take home, calling it "great luck." Those who were unable to buy candles in time would throw money, either dozens, hundreds, or thousands of coins, towards the god before taking a candle away. The shopkeepers they passed would distribute leftover candles, calling it "sending yuanbao," the price of which was several times the value of the candle. Among the officials welcoming spring, the first was the director of education from the prefectural government. From the flags and gongs to the umbrellas and fans, and even the execution tools and divination sticks, all were equipped with red and black hats, and more than a dozen people held whips to clear the way. The clerks of the departments and those carrying registers and seals all wore neat attire and rode slowly past on horseback. At the end was a tiger-skin armchair, carried high by four people, representing the official seat of the prefectural governor. Next was the Water Conservancy prefectural governor, followed by the Chief Constable prefectural governor, their ceremonies similar to the first. After the three prefectural governors, the magistrates of Ren and Qian counties followed closely. The clerks and servants in the county offices were numerous, and their bright ceremonial guards were especially impressive.</p>

<h3>Becoming a Person of the World (4)</h3>
<p>Similarly, a certain wealthy person may be a good family head and neighbor at home, but as soon as he arrives at the office, his attitude changes drastically, becoming as cunning as a fox and as fierce as a tiger. Therefore, all those who compete with him call him an "unscrupulous person." Is he really without conscience? His conscience is only private, not public. Again, legislators, using the convenience of their positions, enact all kinds of laws that benefit the locality, without considering the interests of the entire country. People like this all need a broad conscience that puts the country first. However, nationalism, if taken to extremes, is narrow, such as illegally invading other countries, which is not a blessing for the country or the world. Therefore, they must go a step further and have a conscience for the world, regardless of language, ethnicity, or national boundaries, and seek happiness for all mankind. (3) A kind of world work, everyone should work. But why work? For life? No. If only for life, cows and horses are better at it. For the family? No, if only for the family, tigers and wolves are also good at protecting their own kind. For the country? No, if it is only for the country, how is it different from the Greeks who do not believe in Christ? The ideal of Christians is that people must work for humanity—the world. He must live in such a way that his daily work is connected with the work of promoting world evolution. He is a person with a mission, and his mission is to feed, heal, educate, and redeem the world. In ancient times, those who worked for humanity included Abraham Lincoln in the United States, who advocated the emancipation of slaves, and Wesley Livingston, who preached abroad; General Gordon, who was chivalrous and sacrificed his life for other countries. There are countless others; they are all people who worked for world humanity. In short, who is the one who has these three qualities? It is Jesus of Galilee. He devoted his life to the needs of mankind, to the transformation of the world, and sacrificed his life. He is a good model for us to be human. Finished.

<h3>Perish Together</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>It's really getting more and more absurd. A ten-tael ingot of silver can be valued at more than seven thousand dollars. A US dollar can be exchanged for more than twenty national currency. Some people hoard rice and coal; others hoard cotton yarn and cloth. No matter what the commodity, it is sealed up and sent to the warehouse. It is said, "The price hasn't risen enough yet, not selling!"</p>
<p>Some also take out a little to sell, but their prices make you shake your head. The 工部局 (Gong Bu Ju) 's notice prohibiting the unauthorized raising of prices seems to have no effect at all.</p>
<p>They really want to squeeze every drop of the public's blood and sweat! Although they know very well that the public's purchasing power is dwindling. They are making "immediate money," squeezing as much as they can!</p>
<p>Some have already been squeezed naked and barefoot, even starving to death. Some have been squeezed almost dry, and have no choice but to shamelessly run back to their hometowns in the occupied areas. Those are the weaklings. But there are also those who are tough, unwilling to sit and wait, and take risks for "survival." Haven't you seen the social news reported in the past few days?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the means are legitimate, "wanting to eat" is a common desire. By then, when they have lost the object of their wealth, it will be the time when they won't let you alone hold a golden bowl and eat leisurely!</p>
<p>At that time, even if you hoard gold bars and US dollars, you will perish together!</p>
<h3>Save Everyone (Public Voice, Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Someone</p>
<p>I am a small office worker in a foreign firm, with a monthly salary of fifty-six dollars. Before the war, it was not too shabby to support a family of three (wife and child). But the cost of living after the war has almost increased four or five times. Although I have requested a raise several times, the employer has only increased my salary by 15% and added a living allowance of ten dollars (totaling seventy-four dollars and forty cents). But to support this small family, even just dealing with food and housing is very pitiful.</p>
<p>Because a twelve-dollar attic before the war now costs eighteen dollars. Rice and food cost at least thirty dollars or more per month. Other things like coal briquettes, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are all frighteningly expensive. And what's worse is that in this round of price increases, "sitting and waiting for death" is certainly not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Naturally, thinking a step back, someone like me with such an income could probably be classified as middle-class in this metropolis, right? In this wave of unemployment, I should be calm and patient, and endure this difficult time. But our current suffering is not directly affected by the war, which cannot be denied. People standing on the same boat not caring about the safety of the whole is what makes us have to stand up and shout loudly. At the same time, it is precisely because we are middle-class that it makes you wonder how those in the lowest class are supposed to survive?</p>
<p>There is a story that tells us:</p>
<p>When a great flood submerged a village, two brothers each carried all their belongings and fled in two small boats. On the way, the older brother felt that the younger brother's boat had more things than he did. The two argued, and the older brother secretly devised a plan to stun the younger brother, throw him into the water, and move the things from the younger brother's boat to his own. But that small boat was overloaded. When a wave hit, it sank, and the older brother naturally drowned in the water as well.</p>
<p>Chinese compatriots living on the "isolated island" are just like the brothers in that village. We should tie the two small boats together tightly to resist the current waves! Otherwise, the realization of this story is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Save everyone! It is also saving yourself!</p>
<h3>Recent Commodity Prices in Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Hua Jian</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a friend in Zigong, Sichuan, which included a summary of commodity prices in Sichuan. I am reprinting it below:</p>
<p>Rice: $10 per dou (peck) Blue calico: $1.40 per foot</p>
<p>Coal: 5-6 cents per catty (pound) White cotton cloth: $1.50-1.60 per foot</p>
<p>Pig lard: $1.20 per catty Washcloth: Over $2 per piece</p>
<p>Vegetable oil: $1.10 per catty Hemp yarn socks: $7-8 per pair</p>
<p>Chicken: Over $3 per bird Crepe satin: $3-4 per foot</p>
<p>Duck: Over $2 per bird Silk satin: $3-4 per foot</p>
<p>Fish: Over 10 cents per liang (ounce) Silk floss: $7-8 per catty</p>
<p>Meat: 65 cents per catty Cotton: 5-6 dollars per catty</p>
<p>Eggs: 5-6 cents per egg Gongni shoes: $12 per pair</p>
<p>White sugar: $1.40 per catty</p>
<p>Salt: 40 cents per catty</p>
<p>Tofu: 4 cents per block</p>
<p>From the above summary of commodity prices, we can see that commodity prices in Sichuan are not simply rising wildly. The prices of pig lard, vegetable oil, chicken, and duck are similar to those in Shanghai, as they are not entirely dependent on imported goods. The prices of eggs, meat, and salt are cheaper than in Shanghai because they are local products. However, blue calico, white bamboo cloth, hemp yarn socks, crepe satin, etc., are more expensive because they are entirely dependent on transportation from Shanghai or Hong Kong, which is quite different from the situation in Shanghai, where there is hoarding. Imported goods. The prices of eggs, meat, and salt are cheaper than in Shanghai because they are local products. However, blue calico, white bamboo cloth, hemp yarn socks, crepe satin, etc., are more expensive because they are entirely dependent on transportation from Shanghai or Hong Kong, which is quite different from the situation in Shanghai, where there is hoarding.</p>
<h3>Poor Bones Can't Hold On Any Longer</h3>
<p>— Jin Chuan</p>
<p>Public Voice, Part 3</p>
<p>Gold has risen and foreign exchange has shrunk, so the merchants are taking advantage of the situation again, licking blood from their knives. The burden of life has doubled, making it difficult for my few poor bones to support! I cry to heaven, but there is no response; I enter the earth, but there is no door. Rice costs fifty dollars, coal briquettes cost nine dollars. The prices of daily necessities are rising daily and are impossible to keep track of. They all open their mouths and raise prices by 30% or 50%. But our stomachs cannot go a day without food. However, life is so expensive that we cannot reach it. I do not have the magic of turning things into gold, and I am even considering whether pills can replace food. Even if the few poor bones are made of steel, steel will break; even if the blood is tap water, tap water will run dry. When we reach this point of broken bones and dried-up blood, the poor will all become starving corpses. The merchants' bellies will swell like graves, filled with so many poor bones. They can certainly make fortunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it is likely that after a while, their bellies will burst and they will all perish together. Those on the sidelines will be happy and benefit. It chills me to think of it!</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger!" Now, life is fiercer than a tiger! Tigers can be avoided, but the burden of life cannot be avoided!</p>
<p>Merchants, show some conscience and save hundreds of thousands of compatriots from becoming starving corpses. Otherwise, they will only die in front of you! But how long can you be happy?</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends, New Companions, Writing is Valuable; Famous Scenic Spots, People in Charge Obtain</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prevent the scenic spots from being defaced, the construction of private tombs in scenic areas is absolutely prohibited. Even in non-scenic areas, there are certain restrictions on the land occupied by tombs. Because the land is used for production, and after China's revival, we need to ensure that there are no wandering people in the countryside and no wasteland. However, so much land is occupied by the dead, which is too meaningless. Fortunately, there are now public cemeteries everywhere in China. A plot of public cemetery land can bury many people. Moreover, the practice of cremation is gradually becoming popular. Speaking of advertising, it is even more strictly prohibited in scenic areas. For example, in the past, whenever you encountered a place with the most beautiful scenery, with green mountains looming and blue waters stretching, you would want to relax on a pavilion and look into the distance. But there would always be a big billboard blocking your view, which would be very annoying. Not to mention advertisements for gonorrhea and eye diseases, with naked and ugly women painted on them, or warriors with upturned mustaches, which would make people feel uncomfortable. Even legitimate commercial advertisements are not allowed to be placed in scenic areas. Billboards are not prohibited, but if you want to attract attention, you can set them up in designated areas in the market. Why bother ruining the scenery? Not only are tombs and advertisements prohibited, but also private residences and villas are prohibited. Unless the building is open to the public and anyone can visit it, then it is considered public property. Although many pavilions and buildings have been built in the Yuantouzhu area, they are all public property. The place where Engineer Xue and his wife are entertaining guests is called Shuiyun Tower, which is a newly built building funded by the Taihu Cement Company and owned by the government. The scenery is very beautiful from the top of the building. After a while, Jin Danyun and his wife arrived with many people. Among them, many people had been to Yuantouzhu in Wuxi before, but Mrs. Su Liya and the two Miss He were visiting for the first time. Engineer Xue and his wife were very hospitable, and Jin Danyun and Mrs. Xue met for the first time and were even more cordial. The dishes they are serving today are called Chinese food eaten Western-style. What does it mean to eat Chinese food Western-style? It turns out that all the food materials are Chinese products, and the cooking method is also Chinese, but Western-style knives and forks are also prepared. They knew that Mrs. Su Liya was there today, and she was not used to Chinese chopsticks. But in fact, they did not know that Mrs. Su Liya had long been sinicized. She often eats with Chinese chopsticks, unlike Europeans and Americans who have just arrived in China and cannot handle chopsticks well. The dishes can be separated for each guest, but they are cooked together. The essence of Chinese cooking is to put everything together, like a country, which should be unified, not divided. (273)</p>

<h3>An Englishman's Bird's-Eye View of Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>George Arliss, a well-known British star in Hollywood, recently published an article in the American "Modern Historical Materials" titled "Hollywood—In the Eyes of an Englishman." He described his life in the film industry for the past ten years and the conditions in Hollywood in great detail, vividly and interestingly. The following is a translated excerpt of the original text:</p>
<p>"Of all the cities I've lived in, Hollywood is the most comfortable. Most of the men and women walking on the streets are related to film companies. Even a star walking on the street won't be surrounded, although strangers may suddenly approach to ask their name and say hello.</p>
<p>"My first impression of Hollywood was that it was vast—everywhere you look, there are small villages. There aren't many tall shops and hotels...</p>
<p>"Except for the surrounding mountains, almost all the beauty of Hollywood is man-made.</p>
<p>"I once met a famous stage actor named Joseph Jefferson. I asked him what his interest in acting was like when he was young, and he told me: 'Acting was really hard back then; putting a piece of red cloth on a soapbox and forcing you to sit on it like an emperor, can you imagine how difficult that was?' But now, in Hollywood, all the costumes, sets, and props are so realistic that even if you don't want to be an emperor, you'll naturally feel majestic.</p>
<p>Secondly, George Arliss also told us about the hardships of many Hollywood actors, saying:</p>
<p>"In a film set, you don't necessarily need to know how to cook, how to be a good wife or a mother, but you must learn to be patient. If you're an extra, you have to be in the makeup room at the film set by 7:30 in the morning to prepare for your first shot. Then, you have to wait, wait, and maybe wait until late at night before filming starts. The next day, you have to go there early to wait again. Even a big star, though they can come a little later, can't avoid waiting. Often, after putting on makeup, they have to wait a long time before filming starts. During this time, you can't write letters, you can't read the newspaper, and that's really exhausting!"</p>
<p>Finally, he also told us: the so-called blockbuster hits are usually good films in reality, and definitely not crudely made imitations of others.</p>
<p>Arliss is also writing a book called "My Ten Years at the Studios" to permanently record his history in the film industry. It will soon be published by the American Littell and Brown Company.</p>
<h3>Female Animal Tamer Chen Xiuying – Starred in the Film "Savage King" in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>Wild beasts are fearsome, but to tame ferocious lions and tigers to be as docile as kittens and white rabbits can be seen in movies. Movies can often deceive and create illusions. However, in the circus, Miss Chen Xiuying's amazing skill of subduing tigers and taming elephants is performed live in front of millions of viewers.</p>
<p>Miss Chen is a Chinese overseas from Africa, 21 years old this year. She has been involved with the circus since she was a child. She has been performing for ten years since she was eleven. From Africa through East India to various parts of Southeast Asia, she and her seventy-odd companions in the troupe have wandered through hundreds of docks and more than a dozen countries in tents. Therefore, in addition to her animal taming skills, she can also speak seven different languages.</p>
<p>Four years ago, she learned the national language of her motherland very fluently and participated in many fundraisings for various just causes and good deeds for her motherland. She has had many opportunities to observe and study in circuses in Europe, especially taming lions and tigers, which are rarely seen among foreign women, let alone in China.</p>
<p>Her physique is quite healthy and her appearance is also very beautiful. According to her own words, she once filmed a Cantonese wild animal film "Savage King" for a film company in Hong Kong. Many film companies competed to sign long-term contracts with her, but the tent life of wandering has become too much of a love for her. Because she was reluctant to part with her companions of many years, she politely declined.</p>
<p>The African Circus came to Shanghai to perform this time. Due to acclimatization problems, they rested for a week during the opening. Now it is said that they will soon officially participate in the performance.</p>
<h3>Chen Xiuying's Weapon</h3>
<p>— Chao She</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple to Retire from the Screen</h3>
<p>This publication previously reported that Shirley Temple would retire from the screen to go to school, which has been confirmed. A Reuters dispatch from Hollywood has reported this accurately. Shirley's mother said: I want Shirley to forget about movies for a few years. She has worked very hard and should enjoy herself from now on. Shirley Temple has been working on screen for seven years and is one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood.</p>
<h3>Affection of Two Leading Actors</h3>
<h3>Foreword to "The Wages of Sin"</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Who knew that Hedy Lamarr's seductiveness had an incredible magic. In the past blockbuster "Ecstasy", she had bold performances and erotic provocations that shocked movie fans around the world. "The Wages of Sin" is a representative work of her in Hollywood, and MGM has spared no effort to complete this masterpiece very solemnly.</p>
<p>In her recent works, the English she speaks cannot get rid of the vowels of her native language. But in "The Wages of Sin", she speaks fluent and pure English. This may be a miracle. She has only been in Hollywood for a short year, and she can speak so correctly. If it is not her special intelligence, how can she have such achievements? Not only that, but also in terms of expression and performance, she is exquisite and transparent. Whether it is facial lines, eye movements, or actions, she has very high achievements.</p>
<p>The entire plot undoubtedly touches everyone's heart, especially the sympathy of women. Hedy Lamarr is a woman who has been abandoned. She cannot withstand the oppression of material desires and carnal desires. She commits suicide. Fortunately, a doctor saved her life. In various encounters, she understands the greatness of true love. She abandons her social status and resolutely marries this doctor to do a work of compassion.</p>
<p>The male star who plays the doctor is Spencer Tracy, who starred in "Boys Town". This great artist who won the Academy Award for the Arts has a profound performance in the first time he performed love scenes, which shows his versatility and omnipotence.</p>
<p>The director is the famous Van Dyke, who has five years of stage experience and has been an assistant to the director giant Old Reifeis. Famous films such as "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "Eskimo", "Marie Antoinette", "The Thin Man", and "The Gun Beneath the Sea" were all directed by him and left a lofty reputation.</p>
<p>The above three artists have cooperated to create "The Wages of Sin". At least, it can be said that satisfactory appreciation is an inevitable fact. Anyway, it will be released at the Grand China today, and let the movie fans chew on it themselves!</p>
<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Yu Sulian went to Ningbo to negotiate the performance of the troupe. Because it has not been settled, she is still staying there. Wu Sheng Li Shunlai has been summoned to Yong a few days ago to discuss everything and can return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Ma Yufeng resigned from the Yifeng Drama Society of Carlton University. Originally, the performance was scheduled to end on the 6th, but the society has not found a suitable replacement, so they discussed with her to help out for a few more days until a new actor is invited to leave.</p>
<p>Ma Xiurong has a considerable foundation in martial arts. Now she is studying martial dan drama and feels very diligent. The new stage is preparing to perform a complete Leifeng Pagoda in a few days. Huang Guiqiu and Yan Shishan will play the White Snake, and Xiaoqing will be specially played by Ma Xiurong alone.</p>
<p>Liu Bingui returned to Shanghai from Annam to invite actors. The night before, he hosted a banquet for his senior brother Xiao Shoushan at Nanlaishun. He is very interested in Guan Gong dramas. Xiao Shoushan introduced Li Hongchun to say a few plays for him.</p>
<p>Du Wenlin is singing at the Kunming New Grand Theater. Recently, he sent Zhang Delin back to Shanghai to pick up his daughter Du Lingling and his young son Du Bingrong to Kunming to sing. They are scheduled to leave today. Du Lingling has made many new costumes.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wenjuan's Future</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom House Owner</p>
<p>Kunling Xusheng Zhang Wenjuan is a student of my friend Ding Muqin, a painter. She has performed successively in the Chang'an and Times theaters in Shanghai, and her reputation is well-known throughout Shanghai, and she has the reputation of the second Meng Xiaodong for a while. However, Wenjuan was not complacent because of this. At the end of last year, she and her teacher Zhang Rongkui went north together, hoping to broaden her horizons and seek further education. Her ambition to be ambitious is worthy of praise. After arriving in Ping, under the introduction of Rongkui, she met with famous sages and famous actors in the ancient capital one after another, and met with people from all walks of life on the carpet in the New Year this year. Her new voice was first tried, and her momentum was still strong, and there were many words of encouragement in the newspapers, and the future was bright. The famous drama critic Mr. Zhang Zui Gai admired her even more, and poems and essays were presented to her and published in newspapers from time to time. How fortunate was Wenjuan to encounter this wonderful encounter? Recently, Gai Weng gave her a work praising Juan, titled "Zhang Wenjuan's Art Received from Master," which is extremely capable of rendering praise for this worm. The following are four new poems by him. The poems say:</p>
<p>"Liyuan is a place to live, I don't want to listen to Zheng and Wei's songs. I don't want to entertain myself in this year, and I worship famous actors in Shanghai. She doesn't apply powder and is proud of her beard and eyebrows. She steps onto the stage to perform. She plays the zither and sings loudly to relieve the blocks. The girl is smart and better than a man. Yiguan Youmeng Xi is on the stage, her attitude is dignified and generous. The mountains and rivers are uniquely endowed with spirituality, and Gusu is her old hometown (Wenjuan is Wu Ren). She searches for miscellaneous scripts to comfort her life, and she has worked hard for ten years to learn the art. She is willing to leave a new impression in Yanshi, and Wenjuan's name is A Nono."</p>
