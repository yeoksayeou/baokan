<h3>越南問題與亞歐二戰</h3>
<p>中日戰爭與歐洲戰爭是國際當前的兩件大事，兩事之間，倘若歷史的考察，淵源有自，脈絡相通；但兩事的主體，及其發展的形態，爭持的意義性質以及目標，則儼然各自起訖而不相關連。及至越南發生了問題，似乎將使兩事滙合爲一；於是風雲趨勢遂成爲一般人日常話題。雖然，究竟如何匯合，能否匯合？不但複雜，幷且參差矛盾。</p>
<p>越南問題自始不是一個所謂地方問題，當初却由越南當局當折衝之衝；到了現階段，改在維希與東京兩地交涉，法國與日本乃正式的對立而爲問題的兩主體。日本是中日戰爭中交戰國之一，法在歐洲戰爭中，雖已停戰，尙未媾和，故依然是其中的一員；假使越南問題談判破裂，演進而爲法日衝突，則亞歐兩戰爭的主體至少有其局部相同，利害攸共而形態上近於匯合。可是問題不若此簡單。蓋在中國方面的判斷，以抗建爲自身的唯一亟務，以日本爲當前的唯一對象，而於歐戰的雙方則一視同仁而絕無敵意；惟有在越南變更現狀的時候，中國爲抗建的利害關係上，必不顧一切，不擇手段，出以有效的反對行動；亦即不問行動所反對的是日本，還是法日兩國；此其意義，要在亞歐兩戰雖因局部主體相同而有匯合之觀，但絕非因此而中國參加了歐戰中的任何一方面。英國爲了所屬緬甸與新加坡的安全將受直接威脅而反對越南變更現狀，自不待言；同時，英法在歐戰中的同盟關係雖中途脫輻，但未敵對，而在遠東力面的利害關係，還是緊密的一致；故英國祗會在法國對日本屈讓，且積極的共謀不利於英國的時候，同時反對法日兩國；祗會在法國對日本談判破裂的時候，爲法國後盾；却不會有鑒於英法之間在歐洲的脫輻而支撑日本在遠東所加於法國的壓迫。至於德國：一面對日本，在思想方面的反共關係，因蘇德協定的成立而過去了；在外交方面的縱橫關係，因歐戰爆發而隨着外交時代而消失了；在政界軍略方面的「陣綫」關係，因日本敝於對華作戰而憚於對英作戰，遂不復相委蛇了。一面對法國，由停止戰爭行爲而入於暫時相安的局面；但關於法國所持有的一切，尤如殖民地之類，旣因德法媾和條件尙未成立，而在法埋上，事實上，容忍法國相當的自由應付；却因戰勝法國之故，在權威上，利害上，決不放任法國的自由斷送；更自另一角度觀測之，在德法和约未成，德國有權控制法國，亦即保留機會可以取得法國所持有的一切的時候，德國決不坐視怯弱的法國類乎慷德國之慨而對日本屈讓，相反的，寗願聲援悲壯的法國來對抗日本壓迫。最近德國吐露一種口氣，謂德義兩國方爲歐洲的福利而負責奮鬥，故對於歐洲國家的海外殖民地亦負有同樣責任；如此云云，目光四射，氣燄萬丈，可以視爲總括的對美洲菲洲澳洲而言，而亞洲當然非其例外，日本覬覦法屬越南當然是其警告對象之一。由此說來，假使法國將越南讓渡於日本，決非德國所衷心樂聞；假使法日談判決裂，德國決不視爲日本參加德義軸心而參加歐戰了。試作最愚最無意味的假定：即假定事實上中國不抗戰，日本便有力量來選擇一切，則越南問題不同於現在了；再假定時間在一年之前，歐洲將戰未戰而日本壓迫法屬越南，则國際一切反應，亦不同於現在的一切了；但此類假定，絕不成立，因事實如鐵，時間如逝，相矛盾，相參差，越南問題不能使亞歐兩戰匯合，却使一切因本問題而增進其複雜！</p>

<h3>華軍發言人表示　重慶損毀不足慮　將在同一地點築新城市</h3>
<p>重慶　華軍發言人頃語報界、重慶舊城之完全被毀、僅係給與吾人以在同一地點建築新城市之機會、雖遭此種炸毀、吾人之心中仍安、日本本部之日人、恐將或受較吾人此時所遭遇更爲危險之恐怖、因終有一日、必有有力之外國攻擊、亦以同樣之燃燒彈使東京大阪化爲烏有、（二十二合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　日機四批、又於今午猛烈轟炸東城之商業區與銀行區、曾落下燃燒彈甚多、火勢較昨尤烈、渝市大建築物、如靑年會、交通銀行、及川鹽、美豐兩銀行之大厦、均已波及、查渝市自經去歲五四及昨今兩日之轟炸、民房損毀過半、而昨今兩日之延燒範圍、尤較去年之五四爲廣、是以無家可歸之災民、刻下尙無法統計、蔣委員長對此極爲關切、已下令撥款一百萬元、着賑濟機關迅速從事救濟、藉减災民痛苦、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>說明</p>
<p>歐洲西部海岸，北自挪威之北角，南至西班牙邊境，現已完全在德軍控制之下。德國飛機可自各方面飛往英倫三島轟炸，各處目的地均在九十分鐘飛程之內。其尤屬重要者，匪特德國轟炸機擲彈轟炸之後，仍可飛回根據地，德國戰鬥機且可隨之掩護。換言之，波蘭之戰發作之時，英國僅在德國轟炸機飛程之內，迨至法蘭西之戰結束之後，英國已在德國戰鬥機飛程之內矣。據多數觀察家意見，德國對英作戰可用兩種戰略，卽（一）派兵進攻，（二）封鎖　關於封鎖，可用三種戰術，卽（一）封鎖英國東部南部各港，（二）轟炸其餘各港使失其效用，（三）飛機潛艇襲擊英國商船。此種局勢，一至英國改守爲攻，自當改觀。</p>

<h3>本市中外居民　期望美接防中區　美政府主張由地方解決　連日商團出防頗盡職守</h3>
<p>公共租界B區之接防問題、現雖由萬國商團暫時接替、但此爲一種過渡辦法、終非久長之計、中外人民、均殷切盼望美軍能接防該區、蓋美國無論對於歐洲與遠東戰事、均嚴守中立態度、毫無恩怨而有所偏袒、今以日方固執成見、美軍暫守原防區、留待華盛頓與東京間之交涉妥協後、再行定奪、現據谷關係國外交界消息、現此事已由華盛頓致訓東京美大使與其亞洲艦隊司令、囑其就地解決、在未有成議以前、仍照現時辦法、由萬國商團暫維現狀、</p>
<p>商團美隊招募團員</p>
<p>萬國商團白俄隊及英國隊、自接防英軍撤退筏所遺之丁區後、因其素來人數不多、對實力之擴充、遂頓感需要、昨日該團美國隊隊長阿樂滿發出命令、籲請各隊員勸其親友等踴躍參加商團爲團員、據稱、美國隊十月份新團員訓練季、將採用新式軍操、並希望美海軍麥令隊將供給敎練官、商團團員下月份練習打靶、計分九月二日爲長距離射擊、九月二十五日爲短距離射擊、均自上午六時至九時、屆時參加打靶之各團員、均須於上午九時齊集工部局大厦內萬國商團會操堂、</p>

<p>團員出防暫離職務</p>
<p>查駐防西虹口區之商團團員、皆在本市經商、今離職出防、究須歷時多久、未可斷定故不能確言彼等離職、將對其供職之各商行、有何影響、惟逐日出防、旣僅九六十人、則現行辦法、縱歷長久時期、亦不　使隊員所屬商行、大受打擊、</p>
<p>現行辦法微感不便</p>
<p>美日當局對於「乙」防區接防事進行談判、苟賡續數星期之久、則料商團B字大隊隊員亦將被召出、接替B字大隊隊員之任務、果爾、各商行因職員被召出防而受之影響、將稍减輕、據若干商行聲稱、現行商團接防辦法、苟永久實行、則本市各商行將稍感不便、自無疑義、然現行辦法性質之久暫、尙未可確定、</p>

<h3>遠東危局與　美國政策之加强　滬方形勢當促進美國之積極　英國對日讓步加重遠東危機</h3>
<p>明日出版之密勒氏評論報中之社論，論述最近上海由英軍撤退引起之危機，並認爲美國亟應加强其遠東政策，茲將全文迻譯如次：</p>
<p>英國防軍由上海撤退所引起之危機，或將使美國對於其遠東之巨大權益，不再瞻循徘徊，而對於遠東政策作斷然之決定。上海方面之問題，包括有數千美僑及其他國僑民之生命安全；以及數萬華人因美日關於上海交涉之停頓而陷於危殆。美政府須知此事之眞正負責者，雖爲英日兩國，而世人關於此一局勢惡化之譴責，則不免加於美國身上。英國之所以由此間撤退其蕞爾駐軍，其答案不難於今春三月二十八日英駐日大使克萊琪在東京日英協會之演說求之。距彼數月之前，美大使格魯曾以確切言詞，對日加以譴責，謂美國公衆，對於日軍在華之所爲，以及損壞美國在華權益之惡行，深表憤疾。此一聲言，益以美方之廢止美日商約，使世人對於美國基本政策，殆無復置疑餘地。</p>
<p>英國政策背道而馳</p>
<p>英美對於中日戰爭之政策上的合作，在客觀上雖無困難存在，且英國在華權益之被破壞，復更甚於美國。但英國不惟不予美大使言論以擁護，英大使克萊琪甚且聲稱：「日本與英國均爲歐亞大陸邊緣上之海上强國，且對各該大陸上之情勢，具有莫大之關切，其方法縱有時而異，但兩國均爲同一終極目標而努力，以達到永久和平，並保衛吾人政制免爲外來影響所滋擾，使兩國國策之目標，陷於充分之和諧，並非不能實現之事。」此一演說之時機與趨勢，均隱含啊深刻之意義，以是在英美兩國，均引起輿論之抨擊，致英外次白特勒乃於四月三日在下院答辯時聲明英國對中國合法政府態度之不變。但在繼　質辯英方政策時，白氏復公然爲克萊琪在東京之言論辯護，並謂英政府並不反對增進對日關係。自克氏發表該項霄論後，種種對日妥協行徑，遂接踵而起。接受日方條件，解決天津問題，包括有讓予日方以英租界警察權，將大量天津白銀交付日方，承認日方無保障之紙幣，並許其在英租界流通。在上海，據吾人所知，則有公共租界工部局之土地局案卷交付日方。决復封閉緬甸公路。凡此種種，殆可於義大利之「以利刃劃法國之背」相媲美。</p>
<p>英撤防軍毫無裨益</p>
<p>最近更將此蕞爾防軍，撤離上海，其爲數不過千名，對於英德戰况，顯不能發生何等影響。英人之聚全力以從事歐洲大戰，吾人不願加以評述，但任何英國對日之妥協，殆無法改變日閥在遠束所取之攻勢。且對日本之日漸公開傾向軸心國，亦無從予以阻止。目前形勢，在若干方面，大類前次歐戰中日本之秘密取得協約國同意，以便於大戰之末，攫取中國領土。</p>
<p>遠東問題轉形迫切</p>
<p>德國武力在歐洲之迅速進展，使美國在西太平洋之政策，益形艱危；因歐洲方面之危機，致使十年來遠東待決懸案，轉趨迫切，爲西方民治國所予以容忍之日本對華侵略，刻已擴及東南亞洲。假使日本實行南進，無疑必於德義在歐猛取攻勢之同時。然則美國將如何始能予以有效之阻遏？特別是假如彼時美艦隊或將重調大西洋。數星期前，美國關於遠東問題見解，頗有分歧。范登堡一派主張對日談判新商約，彼認爲如美國刻在遠東實力不足以抗阻日本，則無寗從事和解政策。另一方比較更佔勢力者，則爲現任美陸軍部長史汀生一派，彼等贊助繼續援助中國，認爲此卽美國在遠東對日本最佳之防禦，此際加緊援助中國，繼續予以財政援助，以及軍事器材，必將更能制馭日本之妄動。美國國防程序之限制機器及其他軍用品之輸出，亦具同樣用意。</p>
<p>美人主張蘇美締約</p>
<p>此外，並主張蘇美間應締結有關遠東問題之協定，俾保障中國獨立及東南亞洲現狀。此一重大問題，刻已因滬上情勢之變動而更見迫切。另一方面，美國之參戰問題，最近亦日形露骨，如其果成事實，則美國必當要求英國以及其强大殖民地對美合作，以予美國對遠東政策以支持。</p>

<h3>受謠言支配　金市跌後又漲</h3>
<p>昨日現余烚赤暗盤市况、跌後重漲、人心堪慰、先以滙市走鬆、售戶麕集、開盤五千六百六十元、卽跌至五千六百四十五元、銀號幫賣出居多、嗣賴錢兌業證券幫扒吸、升達五千六百八十元、但終以金號銀號兩幫續吐、再跌至五千六百二十元、午收有錢兌業重扒·告五千六百三十八元、後市初况仍疲、最低竟近五千六百元關上、嗣傳法日越南衝突、及種種混亂利多消息、　市已見回緊、乃突起相當買風、銀號空戶抵逃、散戶亦購、高達五千七百零五元、晚收僅五千六百九十五元、較上日尙小五元、全天交易時靜時鬧、約近三千兩、銀樓飾金未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤僅跌十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外滙報鬆、開市遂被撳小四十元、金號出錢兌業二十兩、爲五千六百六十元、嗣因金銀兩幫競吐、續跌十五元、銀號出證券幫二十兩、退爲五千六百四十五元、此後賴某錢兌業與證券幫扒吸、一度市勢轉穩、錢兌業進銀號三十兩、升爲五千六百八十元、奈外滙繼續吿硬、浮空乘勢加碼、金號與銀號復來爭塞、未幾卽小至五千六百五十元、而斯時散多見景亦忍痛斬結、賣風因之擴大、再慘落三十元、金號出證券幫三十兩、爲五千六百二十元低價、午刻錢兌業及證券幫見賤再來狂吸、且賣者减少、收盤前曾回高二十餘元、惟收市卒因銀號吐出、僅有五千六百三百八元、午後初開仍疲、開市竟撳二十八元、銀號出金號二十兩、爲五千六百十元、繼又挫落五元、見五千六百零五元、低盤後以證劵幫扒吸、市勢稍轉、立回升二十元、不久某銀號突來狂扒補空、再漲十餘元、且斯時忽傳越南法日衝突消息、匯市走緊、頓引起相當賣風、另一銀號亦來補空、雖錢兌業多頭居間塞出、立漲達五千六百七十元、旋因買風稍息、曾回落十餘元、但終因外匯愈緊、證券幫多頭加碼、迨收盤前竟衝出五千七百元關口、錢兌業進銀號二十兩、升爲五千七百零五元、惟收盤略回、爲五千六百九十五元、結果比十日僅跌五元、全天一百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收排减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金鎮日不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未動、大同行仍懸五百八十元、新同行與上價相仿、收盤减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>英金票獨見猛跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤跌後又漲、故美美金鎊各跌一元五角後、於下午卽行回起、英金票上午平疲、午後謠言蠭起、各方供給頓旺、市價猛跌、美金票因市傳消息紛岐、上午一度退至十七元五角八分、午後突然抬至十七元八角三分、比上日軋升一角、香港票需要漸减、市價略軟、日金票及朝鮮票均因流通額稀少、然各方需要頗殷、致市價頻漲不已、前者抬至一元四角五分、後者高至一元零八分、</p>
<h3>絲綢棉布的鑒別</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>買衣料最難的是怎樣去鑒別質料之好壞，因爲質材的好壤，就爲效用的優劣，根據筆者服務的經騐把絲綢棉布鑒別簡易的方法，寫在下面。</p>
<p>絲綢質地輕薄，經緯的組織嚴密與否，不容有掩飾的可能；因此，可以一望而知。但同一種的絲綢，大有輕重之別，身分重好與輕次，其價相去甚鉅，就難免有一出好貨價錢，買劣貨物品之弊，於是我們不得不加以區別了，」絲綢分兩重者，以綢面膩　光亮而無粗糙之跡爲上品；分兩輕者，以綢面勻凈飄逸而無併絲擗裂之痕者爲第一。其有雜攙漿膠重者，以手搓散屑粉卽下；輕者，以舌舐之，味感甜膩，而且舐通之處，並不立卽濕透。至於原料之爲人造絲與天然絲可抽出其經緯少許，分別用火燃燒，發臭而有團結在一起的灰爲眞絲，遇火卽化燼，立刻飛散無餘者爲人造絲，這一點卽在脂肪質與纖維質之區別了</p>
<p>至於棉布，則較諸鑒別絲綢似乎比較不易認淸些，漿重布薄，向陽光照視，可以察出經緯之間，完全爲漿膠所掩沒了布眼，而且布面也比較堅硬。執布一端，先扯其橫面，再扯其縱面，扯後仍如原狀者，布身堅固；扯後左右歪斜長短不均者，布身鬆次，染色之布，用白手帕在布面上往來摩擦，發見帕上有色，布面有暈，則布旣漿重，而且色料也極易脫落，經緯綫拉斷時，綫頭發毛，且易斷者布劣；綫頭光潔而堅靱者布佳。更有一種麻織品，身地脆薄，亦可充棉織品，那可以用手在布面撫摩，覺滑而堅者卽是，團皺後，其皺紋亦較多，且有折裂之象，這是購買者所不可不注意的。</p>
<h3>證劵　內債略小　外股活動</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况居然小起回風、而並無劇跌模樣、祗因檯面浮多較爲擁擠、紛起斬結、致曾壓小二三角、更以其上漲多日、而尙未有正式利多消息、故略爲回小爲必由之途徑、以人心堅定、籌碼不充、故稍小又引起補空、脚地仍屬穩定、惟刻下行市或將以多方漸感滿足、空方不願高價抵補、在雙方堅持下、暫趨於安定、再待環境之變化、昨日上午初由聯和恒康買進而堅、繼由鴻大同康鴻康等賣出而小、再由樂茂久豐等買進而稍稍回上、午後聯和久豐繼續買進、同康亦轉賣爲買、惟益昌鴻大聯益順泰等賣出仍多、致仍抬頭不起、結果略小五分至一角半、成交數目約一百二十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交家庭工業社股一百股、價爲七十九元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市交易之鉅、爲最近數月中所罕覯、橡皮股上漲之速、無與倫比、於以見一般投資者在前此市面寗靜時、源源吸進、非爲無因、實業股未被遺棄、多種亦有驚人漲風、就大體言、視橡皮股之蓬勃略遜、獲利了結之風、與急亟漲勢並肩而至、相映成趣、昨日市况之堅昂、當然得力於各種謠言、而非得力於含有確定性的合理事實、</p>
<p>倫敦二十一日週三電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均吿平靜、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　遠期紗　大戶仍在套出</h3>
<p>紗市略漲，趨勢漸露上升模樣、但實際銷路不及上日之旺、然一般投機人心、反爲緊挺、此因市塲傳說、申新九廠自九月份起、對於雙馬棧單暫緩打出、（此事內容究屬如何、尙不得而知、投機者或有作用、亦未可知也）、所以檯面上籌碼感覺枯狀、惟遠期九月份變馬價較現貨爲廉、始做九百上五元、後至九百十七元、大戶頗有套出之意也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市象尙和平、叫　聲穩靜、二十支雙馬價爲化百十五元、但此盤一開、搶帽子觀望爲多、旋卽微漲至十九元、此時稍有賣出、形勢未緊、詎料大業公司限價九百十七元收進、某某亦來拖進、於是一鬨直到九百二十九元、氣勢俏俐、喊聲熱鬧、不料半路上廣幫大戶、忽來賣出白餘、價格陡降至九百二十一元、收盤稍好一二元、爲九百二十三元、査半日間成交統計一千四百〇五包、行情二十支雙馬漲五元半、又査棉紗今日有三十件、運往海口、又三百七十件、運往香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如下、</p>
<p>同行　一、九四〇　江西　二〇</p>
<p>香港　二五五　內地一九〇</p>
<p>統計二、四〇五</p>
<h3>廠辦雖寂　棉商尙待善沽</h3>
<p>現棉交易、稍形起色、日廠納胃、雖無大量暢健、然零星採辦、續而不斷、然處此目前環境中、售價仍難大漲也、大致情形無大變遷、蓋以紗市不起、而日紗售價、更廉白元外、華紗銷路雖不斷乏、但航運中斷加之新棉作已入佳境、所以棉市在此新花逐漸登塲之際、仍在不死不活中、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况殊為堅定、先因投機者之購買、續後又因華爾街股票價格之良好、及一部份銀行界在市之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起四五磅音、印度昨日連同預測漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來仍靜寂異常、廠方未聞有添購之訊、市上因日來到船不多、故現貨日稀、同業間擁有之少額現貨、俱擬善價而沽也、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆市氣轉軟</h3>
<p>黃豆銷塲、轉見懈淡以來、市氣徘徊於平凡局面、至於來源在價高招徠遠貨之情形下、亦見熱鬧、故潛勢雖無精彩、且呈軟化、昨做開第二批常州來新牛皮黃二百包、一共運抵二車、因貨品較首批爲次、故價祗開三十三元、其他成交安慶豆六百包、價爲二十一元至三十一元四角、蕪湖豆一百餘包、價為　十一元四角、崇明豆三十四包、價爲二十元零四角、浦柬社豆五十包、價爲三十一元、崇明沙黃五十包、價爲二十八元、及漢口乍豆三百包、價爲二十八元二角云、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有七百五十包、並豆油四十六件、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米仍昂</h3>
<p>洋米市况、早晨開市後、買氣依然活潑、內地幫雖無大批交易、然零星去化漸見活絡、且有合作社等問津、而南幫與鄉莊亦多趁平吸收、貨主以產價難劃、仍多搶守、而一般浮囤又乘機活躍、迄中市各價已高一元有奇至此出籠漸多、反形出多進少、節節回疲、收盤價較前市略增五六角、計一號陳西貢爲五十九元、新五十七元六角、二號五十四元、五十三元半、一號暹羅五十八元半、火絞五十八元二角、五十七元四角、香港尖五十七元半、五十六元、回籠原包漲半元至元、計有寗波幫回出西貢米菉三百噸價開五十五元、又市上做開混合碎七十五噸、價五十一元半至五十二元半、西貢二號一百五十噸、價六十二元半至六十三元、又暹羅二號五十噸、價六十三元、均由客囤收進、現米則成交一萬四千包、亦以客囤浮戶爲主、至本街實銷及容幫立裝者尙乏暢胃云、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、到貨依然不繼、致明暗市交易、際洋米續緊之間、傳聞頓亦活絡異常、售價遂在貨主扳轉之下、並升五六角至七八角不一、常幫鮮淸粳六十八元、特粳六十六七元、無錫淸粳六十六元四角、六十六元、常州蘇崑粳高自六十五元半次至宿六十一元、宿簿稻六十二元半、南港早稻原包六十三元半、六十二元半、斛見新鮮特別六十二元半、六十二元、普通六十元左右、次至宿五十八元七角、糯米金溧特貨六十八元、常丹貨六十元五十九元、香港特元六十一二元、普通五十九元、六十元、砶元五十四五元云云、</p>
<p>周浦新粳、昨日來源更稀、祇二十八担、而銷塲相隨地貨並見旺盛、致一霎卽已吿罄、似有不敷分配之槪、市色因是尤獨緊俏、陡漲一元、開特別貨六十三元、中六十二元、</p>
<h3>供源漸增　粉市續疲</h3>
<p>麵粉昨　吿鬆疲、査華粉廠盤雖未更動、而福新廠已繼續供應、日廠粉鳳凰牌又開足全車、所以供源漸增、人心平淡、南北客銷以運輸或阻或通、新交易自難發展、故昨市綠鳳凰牌八月份十四元二角、九月份十四元五角至四角七分半、十月份十四元六角至六角半、比上日均小一角半至二角、廠粉與日粉成交數量各有一二四千包、洋粉交易仍靜、內地金山牌十四元八角、偶有本街點綴而已、</p>
<p>小麥昨日市情、漲跌兩難、查內地來貨及成本而論、並無特別利益、兼之日廠收買小麥、對於泥灰斤兩問題、頗爲頂眞、稍一不愼、卽須受虧、故一般貨主、均不願輕易脫手也、昨日交易、華廠收進不足千包、日廠收買約有三千包、售價均與前盤相仿、大部份俟貨到猶在評價中、</p>
<h3>糖市　冬霧青　久別重逢　荷赤續開萬二千包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤二四粗白、本棧貨七十三元五角、外棧貨新到七十三元五角、老貨七十三元、均升二角、轉口貨五十八元二角、升五角、八月二十九打單五十八元四角、太古B嘜價仍爲七十四元七角不動、DY嘜七十一元、HX嘜七十元零六角、路貨打單者DY嘜六十九元五角、HX嘜六十九元五角、續問小二角、爲六十九元三角、M嘜車赤六十一元、荷棉白TML嘜七十三元五角、RD嘜七十二元二角、荷赤KD嘜九月六日打單轉口爲五十六元、本廠雪白七十二元、本廠一號冰九十一元五角、品明冰九十三元、太古續開荷赤五千包、價與昨日相同、後又有綫和糖行續開七千包、價二·六·二·五、美金C．L．F．T．C．例升六分半、信益公司開出冬霧靑六百餘包、價六十一元、白包東鄉赤五十七元、成交一百餘包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新湘蓮漲拾元</h3>
<p>新湘蓮首批本湖蓮、曾開二百十元、茲有續到數十件、昨已開出價爲二百二十元、漲起十元、陳貨無甚上落、冷氣白蓮二百十五元、湖蓮六十五元、</p>
<h3>頂極圓高昂逾恒</h3>
<p>大粒桂圓近以乏到、市存日見軋缺、故售價高昂逾恒、如篩莊頂極現市已達二百元、比前步升三十元、惟中小粒需要較淡、較爲平定云、</p>
<h3>黑白椒供求相稱</h3>
<p>胡椒隨到隨銷、雖市存不多、適足應付、堪稱平衡、刻市黑大與一號椒，同售一百零六元、白椒穩定如前、未見變史、</p>
<h3>五金　純銻獨見昂俏</h3>
<p>昨日五金市况依然岑寂、惟純銻存貨、因港地目下無貨來滬、故僅一二家有貨、刻每噸在八千元左右、較前又升百數元、</p>
<h3>進出口　茶棄棉布　裝運南洋</h3>
<p>昨日有毛冷四箱、由香港來滬、輪去則有茶葉三十五件、另有一百四十五件茶葉、運往新加坡、</p>
<p>今日出口貨物、有棉布三百二十七件、運往香港、另有三十五件、運往海口、</p>

<h3>小學敎師的膳食問題</h3>
<p>— 虞人</p>
<p>小學敎師生活的淸苦，是誰都知道的。十之八九，他們每月的收入，不到四十塊錢，在物價高貴到這樣的孤島上，有室有家，是難於夢想得到的事。衣裳可以破一點，睡覺可以隨遇而安，行路可以開步走，可是一日三餐的飽肚子，倒是實在無法解決的。「他們究竟是怎樣塞飽肚子的呢？」這個問題，在最近碰到了幾個老同學，才知道了一個大槪：</p>
<p>（一）敎師自組膳食公司—這個辦法，要在範圍較大的學校才做得到。祇少要有二三桌人吃飯，才可以請個廚司，自己開伙食。吃粥吃飯，大家商量決定，還像「個人」吃飯的樣子。月終結算，平均攤派，每人約需二十元。</p>
<p>（二）校長包飯—是校長住在校內或學校附近的學校才有可能。一些善良的校長先生和太太往往能够體恤敎師，給敎師吃的膳食質量均較好，費用較省。不過另一些會算的校長先生和太太，往往把自己家裏的膳食費用的一部或全部，也都加到了敎師的身上，敎師的負擔就重了。</p>
<p>（三）學校供膳—十之八九祇供午膳，通常很壞。因爲供午膳的學校總是不供宿，這種塲合的敎師也是很苦的。</p>
<p>（四）吃包飯—冷飯，冷菜，冷湯，吃壞肚子是常事，費用到不小。</p>
<p>（五）寄膳—是寄在親戚朋友家裏吃飯。但是來去費時間，辰光又往往不準，難免有說不出的苦處。</p>
<p>（六）吃客飯—在弄堂裏，難得有家巴下等客飯店，敎師們往往去吃一頓中飯。但因爲房子小，客人多，等一個鐘頭，是極普通的事。最近價目自四角漲到了五角以後，每月中飯的十五元，加上早點晚膳，其數更可觀了。</p>
<p>（七）自動手—合一二個同事，自己買米買菜燒飯吃。因爲人少，開支往往很大，而且燒一餐飯，要費去不少的時間，白天就沒有功夫改卷子了。</p>
<p>（八）買飯買粥買現成菜—自已不會燒菜弄飯的敎師，爲經濟起見，往往每頓叫校工出去買來吃。這種吃法，是最不衛生，費用也不省。</p>
<p>（九）無規律的亂吃—有一些敎師，他們在吃包飯，吃客飯，自己燒統統試過，發生困難以後，就採取了一種極端的辦法。有錢，上館子吃客飯，沒有錢就上飯攤，或是一連吃上幾天的白粥，包子，大餅油條。他們的生活毫無規律，着實可憐。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，孤島上成千累萬的小學敎師們，他們的膳食問題，除了上面第一第二兩種以外，都沒有得到合理的解決。但他們却負着敎育未來的國家主人的重任。筆者在此，十二萬分的希望着加了學費以後的學校，也儘可能酌量增加敎師的待遇。</p>
<h3>「虎口」</h3>
<p>— 漾</p>
<p>早上九時許，因事出外，剛出家門不遠，見人頭擁擠，定是發生了什麼可看熱鬧的事，爲好奇心所驅使，軋入人叢中去張望，可是不看尙可，一看心驚胆怕，一個四十多歲的女人，被公共汽車輾得腦漿滿地，其狀可慘極了。</p>
<p>聽說死的是汽車站旁薦頭店內待傭婦，因與該店送傭婦上工之店夥爭寗蒲扇，在馬路中追逐爲戲，以至大禍臨頭而不知。</p>
<p>想到前數日中，該馬路附近已輾死過二小孩及一老婦。推其原因，不外早上買小菜來往人多擁擠，晚上燈光不足，容易發生危險。最可惡的是剃頭店中空閒下來的剃頭師，喜與娘姨打情駡俏，在馬路中央追逐往來，這不但託她照顧的小孩容易出事，就是行路人也常常被他們衝撞。</p>

<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>我點頭道：「當然，時間跟衣服都是鐵證。他傷在面頰上嗎？」</p>
<p>「大槪如此，旅館裏的人也不很淸楚。」</p>
<p>「以後你怎樣？」</p>
<p>「我知道霍先生能自己出去，也許已經回來，便打電話到這裏來問，施桂回答我不曾回來。我又料想他到鄰近的醫院裏去，就連續跑了四個醫院，都沒有結果。我不知道他到那裏去了，我很着急。」</p>
<p>我想了一想，說道：「照這情勢看，他不但沒有危險，連傷也一定不十分重。你不用着急，着急也沒有用。」</p>
<p>倪金壽道：「我總覺得對他不住。……那末，他到那裏去了呢？」</p>
<p>「我想我們不久就可以得到他的消息。」</p>
<p>倪金壽沉吟了一下，又說：「包先生，你想打他的是誰？會不會就是余甘棠？」</p>
<p>「我不知道。不過若說余甘棠本人，我可以保證不是。」我就把我尾隨余甘棠的經過情形，從追上電梯起，一直到昌明里止，簡括地說了一遍。</p>
<p>倪金壽臉上有了些轉變，巳不像先前進來時那麽惶急懊喪。他振作地說：「這余甘棠有了着落，那倒是個好消息。這個人對於王麗蘭的事，確有重大的嫌疑。剛才打霍先生的，說不定就是他的同黨。」</p>
<p>他也把到江南大學去調查的事吿訴我。據一個同宿舍的姓劉的學生說，余甘棠大約在昨夜十二點半過後才回宿舍，回來後又出去過一次，夜裏也翻來覆去，也像不曾好睡，一淸早又趕出去，沒有人知道他的行踪。合着我所看見和聽見的情形，他的嫌疑當眞很重。我們談了一回，倪金壽便發表他的結論。</p>
<p>他說道：「霍先生旣然不像會有危險，我們又沒處去找他，不如先去將這姓余的拘住了再說。」</p>
<p>我點頭道：「好，我可以陪你去。我想他此刻還在昌明路昌明里一弄三號——慢，我要到樓上去拿一樣東西。」　（八四）</p>
<h3>賣書</h3>
<p>— 番其</p>
<p>阿南很快地包了一包書。</p>
<p>他的心靈似乎感到一陣感傷的情緒，覺得眞破落的太不像樣了，連這些平日寳愛得像性命一樣的書籍，也要送到舊書攤上去了。</p>
<p>挾着這一大包的書跑出寄宿舍的時候，那房東太太恰巧站在門口，彷彿有些驚奇，上下的把阿南打量了一番，他忽忽地俯下頭，不和他招呼，衝過去了。</p>
<p>走到馬路上，炎熱的秋老虎威脅着阿南，但是他只顧挾着書默默地走着，馬路上擠滿了人，互相爭扎着，喧嚷着，電車，汽車，黃包車，風馳電掣的經過，但是似乎都與他沒有什麼感想似的，走到一爿舊書店的門口，借着昏黃的燈光，他看到收買舊書的牌子。他正想進去，却又立刻退了出來，他覺得走進舊書店去賣書是一種可羞恥的，墮落的行爲。他拉拉帽子，還是徘徊在書店的門口，躊躇着不敢進去。</p>
<p>「我又不是偷了別人的書才來賣的，這是正大光明的舉動，有什麼怕羞呢？進去吧！要解決自己的生活問題，不得不如此，鼓起勇氣進去！」阿南把帽子拉低了一點，終於走了進去。</p>
<p>「先生，你要買什麼書？」</p>
<p>「不，我有幾本舊書，請你看看，要不要？」阿南勉强着說出道幾句話。</p>
<p>「你要多少？」一個夥計走近來，將幾本書翻了一下，向他丢了個鄙夷的眼光，懶懶問着。</p>
<p>「你說！」</p>
<p>「不，你的東西，應該你自己說的。」</p>
<p>「五塊錢！」看了那傢伙鄙夷不屑的態度，阿南再也不敢多開口了。</p>
<p>「不要。」那夥計直截了當的說。</p>
<p>「依你說値多少錢呢？』</p>
<p>「一隻洋！」</p>
<p>阿南嚇得幾乎跳起來，想馬上把那夥計重重的打上兩下巴掌，原價十八九元的書籍，只値一塊錢，這眞是笑話，恐怕他還當這些書是從別人家偷來的呢。現在我縱使窮，也不能這樣的賤價拍賣。想當時買來的時候，也是煞費了苦心才到手的。</p>
<p>「那末算三塊罷！」可是肚子又煎逼通着，阿南不得不又屈服了。</p>
<p>「不要」！那夥計用着不睬的神氣，返身走開了。</p>
<p>阿南憤怒地離開了這書店，覺得受了極大的恥辱，一團憤怒的火，在心中炎炎的燒着，一舊書店原來是一個剝削貧苦學生的所在！」</p>

<h3>貢獻給滑稽界</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>記得當「八一三」之初，筆者那時正服務桑梓，交通受了阻碍，新聞紙便無法遞到，於是每天便以收音機聽消息爲事，除了慷慨激昂令人眉飛色舞的報導以外，我最認爲使我感動的，却是滑稽界的大聲呼籲了。他們以滑稽而生動的言辭出之，雖遠處數百里以外，亦恍如置身前敵，目睹戰士們的雄姿，傷者的婉轉呼號，義憤填膺而不能自己也。</p>
<p>本來滑糟戲似乎脫胎於平劇中的丑，一面愚，一面智，愚中有智，智中有愚，信口開合，而自然入妙。考之舊籍，有下面這樣的記載：「丑爲戲劇脚色之名，敷粉墨於面而插科打　者，俗亦謂之小花面，亦有作尋常服飾，僅以聲容笑貌動人，則又別爲一格矣。」這裏的所謂「別爲一格，」自然正如今日之所謂滑稽—獨脚戲，由此可知滑稽戲也不脫爲伶官備譎諫之一，他們所負的使命，自然也是在乎針砭世俗，固不僅逗人一笑而已。</p>
<p>然而滑稽戲在今日，則顯然已漸趨沒落之途，日前本欄所載精誠君「敬吿滑稽界」一文中，所說「愛聽的人漸漸由厭惡而放棄，」甚至於「害得聽者都感到頭痛，」因此精誠君希望滑稽界該「力圖改進」「闢一新生之途，」而提出了三個今日滑稽界惡劣的現象，這自然是一種不可忽視的貢獻。</p>
<p>無疑的，今日滑稽戲除了在「無形中變成小曲」以外，而且幾與往昔鄕村上賣糖的「小熱昏」一般，入於無聊胡鬧一流，這原因，一般人把滑糟戲認作一種下流的娛樂，婦人孺子的消遣品，而不願加以重視；滑稽界自身則往往把自己看得像不登大雅之堂似的，不免自暴自棄，於是造成了滑稽戲的每况愈下，是無可諱言的。因此，希望滑稽戲從事改進，我想文化界至少不能坐視，除了予以糾正指導以外，更該予以一種有力的援助如編製脚本等等，滑稽界限於自身學識的不足，需要買曲作脚本是無可如何的事，而且這總比較隨便胡謅爲有意義的多，同時，滑稽界也大可不必妄自菲薄，以爲自身不過僅僅以滑稽的天才，供人玩笑的一個工具，與社會無多大聯繫，要知道一言一語，足以影響每個婦孺的。理，這重任是不容推諉的。</p>
<p>雖然今日孤島已窒息得令人透不過一口氣來，但藉此輸送一些輕鬆的刺激，我想滑稽界能從此稍稍改換作風，也許前途正大有可爲呢！</p>

<h3>Franco-Japanese Governments Continue Vietnam Negotiations; French Government Sends New Note to Japan; Japanese Foreign Minister Explains Attitude Towards the South China Sea Region</h3>
<p>Vichy: According to reliable sources, the French and Japanese governments are continuing negotiations to discuss the development of commerce between Japan and French Indochina. The French government sent a new note to Japan at the end of last week. Foreign reports that negotiations between the two sides have broken down are "absolutely untrue." Such rumors are clearly intended to confuse and make people believe that relations between France and Japan are strained. The economic negotiations mentioned above were initiated by the Japanese Konoe Cabinet. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, a joint association organized by various public corporations concerned about the South China Sea region was established this afternoon, with former Colonial Minister Kodama as chairman. Foreign Minister Matsuoka declared at the meeting that Japan's basic national policy, announced on August 1, aims to quickly resolve the China Incident and build a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, including China, Japan, "Manchukuo," and the South China Sea region. To fulfill its mission, Japan must be prepared to deal with various difficulties from Western powers with significant interests in the South China Sea region, as Japan feels particularly concerned about that region. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently gave a speech celebrating the establishment of a new South Seas organization, saying that Japan is prepared to face any problems arising from third countries' interests in the South Seas. Today, sixteen organizations of the Japan South Seas Association, including merchants, industrialists, and research experts, have formed a "General Federation of Japan South Seas Associations." The purpose of this new organization is to "cooperate closely with the government to realize Japan's policies." Matsuoka continued that because European and American countries also have significant interests in the South Seas, Japan is seriously concerned about this. Japan must be fully prepared to deal with all kinds of difficulties caused by the relationship between third countries and the South Seas. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

It is said that Japan hopes to end the Sino-Japanese war as soon as possible and establish a new order in the Far East, including the South China Sea region. European and American interests in the South China Sea are deeply rooted. Japan knows that there will be many difficulties ahead, but it is determined to move forward and remove them. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A newspaper here published an article by the famous political commentator Tamura, stating that Britain is aware of the danger of a breakdown in Anglo-Japanese relations, so it is withdrawing British troops to Singapore. Britain is at war with Germany and Italy and naturally wants to avoid adding new enemies, but it also knows that mere concessions will not win Japan's sympathy, so it is abandoning attempts to appease Japan. Will Japan participate in the war to attack British interests, or will it be satisfied with seizing Britain's position in China? In any case, Japan must take appropriate measures.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Vietnam Question and the Second World War in Asia and Europe</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War and the European War are two major events currently in the international situation. If we examine them historically, they have their origins and interconnectedness. However, the subjects of the two events, their forms of development, the meaning and nature of the disputes, and the objectives are clearly separate and unrelated. When the Vietnam question arose, it seemed that the two events would merge into one; thus, the trend of the situation has become a daily topic of discussion for the general public. However, how exactly will they merge, and can they merge? It is not only complex but also inconsistent and contradictory.</p>
<p>The Vietnam question was never a so-called local issue. Initially, it was used by the Vietnamese authorities as a buffer. At the current stage, negotiations have been moved to Vichy and Tokyo, and France and Japan are officially opposing each other and becoming the two main subjects of the issue. Japan is one of the belligerents in the Sino-Japanese War, and France, although it has ceased hostilities in the European War, has not yet made peace, so it is still a member of it. If negotiations on the Vietnam question break down and evolve into a Franco-Japanese conflict, then the subjects of the Asian and European wars will at least partially overlap, with shared interests and a form close to convergence. However, the issue is not that simple. In China's judgment, resistance and nation-building are its only urgent tasks, Japan is its only current target, and it treats both sides of the European war equally and has no hostility towards either side. Only when Vietnam changes its current state will China, for the sake of resistance and nation-building, disregard everything, use any means, and take effective opposition actions. That is, regardless of whether the action opposes Japan or both France and Japan, the meaning of this is that although the Asian and European wars may have a convergence due to the partial overlap of subjects, China will never participate in any side of the European war because of this. It goes without saying that Britain opposes changes to the status quo in Vietnam because the safety of its territories of Burma and Singapore will be directly threatened. At the same time, although the alliance between Britain and France in the European war has been disrupted, they have not become enemies, and their interests in the Far East are still closely aligned. Therefore, Britain will only oppose both France and Japan when France yields to Japan and actively conspires to the detriment of Britain. It will only stand behind France when negotiations between France and Japan break down. It will not support Japan's oppression of France in the Far East in view of the disruption between Britain and France in Europe. As for Germany, on the one hand, the anti-communist relationship with Japan in terms of ideology has passed due to the establishment of the Soviet-German Pact. The diplomatic relationship in terms of diplomacy has disappeared with the outbreak of the European War and the diplomatic era. The "frontline" relationship in terms of politics and military strategy no longer exists because Japan is exhausted from its war against China and is afraid of fighting against Britain. On the other hand, it has entered a temporary state of peace with France from the cessation of hostilities. However, regarding everything held by France, such as colonies, because the German-French peace terms have not yet been established, it tolerates France's considerable freedom in dealing with it in terms of law and in fact. However, due to the victory over France, it will never let go of France's freedom to squander it in terms of authority and interests. From another perspective, when the German-French peace treaty is not concluded, Germany has the right to control France, that is, to reserve the opportunity to acquire everything held by France. Germany will never sit idly by and watch the cowardly France yield to Japan in a way that is generous to Germany. On the contrary, it would rather support the tragic France in resisting Japanese oppression. Recently, Germany revealed a tone, saying that Germany and Italy are responsible for the welfare of Europe, so they also have the same responsibility for the overseas colonies of European countries. Thus, its gaze is radiant and its arrogance is overwhelming, which can be regarded as a summary for the Americas, Africa, and Australia, and Asia is certainly no exception. Japan's desire for French Indochina is certainly one of its warning objects. From this point of view, if France transfers Vietnam to Japan, it is definitely not something that Germany would sincerely like to hear. If the Franco-Japanese negotiations break down, Germany will never regard it as Japan joining the German-Italian axis and participating in the European War. Let's make the most foolish and meaningless assumption: that is, assuming that China does not resist, Japan will have the power to choose everything, then the Vietnam question will be different from now. Also, assuming that it was a year ago, Europe was on the verge of war, and Japan was oppressing French Indochina, then all international reactions would also be different from everything now. However, this kind of assumption is absolutely untenable, because the facts are as solid as iron, and time is passing. Contradictory and inconsistent, the Vietnam question cannot make the Asian and European wars converge, but it makes everything more complicated because of this issue!</p>
<h3>Various Parties Promote the Recruitment of Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Leiyang: The Hunan Winter Clothing Recruitment Committee mobilized all sectors of society to widely promote the winter clothing recruitment campaign, with a quota of 200,000 pieces to be sewn by the end of September and distributed to the soldiers in early October for protection against the cold.

<p>Chengdu: The Sichuan Provincial Mobilization Committee convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies on the 22nd to discuss the recruitment of winter clothing.

<h3>Chinese Side Watches Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Although people in Chinese circles here have no comment on British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks on the war in the House of Commons, the general public has a deep impression of the sincerity and trust of the British Prime Minister. Although the Chinese people do not believe that the danger of Germany attacking Britain has passed, they all believe that Britain's position is much stronger than when France surrendered. At the same time, the Chinese people are also paying very close attention to the close cooperation between Britain and the United States, believing that it will have a far-reaching impact on the future development of the Pacific.

<h3>Chinese Military Spokesman Says Chongqing Damage Not Worth Worrying About, Will Build New City on Same Site</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman recently told reporters that the complete destruction of the old city of Chongqing only gives us the opportunity to build a new city on the same site. Although we have suffered such destruction, we are still at peace in our hearts. The Japanese people in Japan proper may be in more danger of terror than we are experiencing now, because one day, a powerful foreign attack will turn Tokyo and Osaka into ashes with the same incendiary bombs. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Four batches of Japanese planes again fiercely bombed the commercial and banking districts of the eastern city this afternoon, dropping many incendiary bombs. The fire was even more intense than yesterday. Large buildings in Chongqing, such as the YMCA, the Bank of Communications, and the Sichuan Salt and Meifeng Banks, have been affected. Since the bombings of May 4 last year and yesterday and today, more than half of the civilian houses in Chongqing have been damaged. The scope of the fires yesterday and today is even wider than that of May 4 last year. Therefore, there is currently no way to count the number of disaster victims who have lost their homes. Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about this and has ordered the allocation of 1 million yuan to the relief agencies to quickly carry out relief efforts to alleviate the suffering of the disaster victims. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese Air Force spokesman today denied rumors that Japanese bombers were protected by fighter planes when they raided Chongqing, saying that the Japanese have recently used more reconnaissance planes in their air raids. Each bomber formation has one reconnaissance plane to guide it. These reconnaissance planes often use smoke to create circles or straight-line markings in the air to guide the bombers to drop their bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Situation in Chinese Occupied Areas; British Government Has Lodged Representations with Japanese Government Regarding Shipment of Red Cross Supplies to China via Burma</h3>
<p>London: British Undersecretary Butler stated yesterday in response to a question from Conservative Party MP Graham that Foreign Secretary Halifax had not received any information that customs duties in the Chinese occupied areas had recently changed. Graham also asked whether the British government had received a satisfactory response from Japan regarding the restriction of third-country trade in North and Central China after representations were made. Butler replied that the Foreign Secretary had instructed the Ambassador to Japan to report on the progress of the matter. Harvey, a member of the Independent Progressive Party, asked the government to pay attention to China's urgent need for surgical instruments and medicines for civilians supplied by the Red Cross and asked whether the government could find a way to transport these supplies to China via Burma. Butler replied that Ambassador Craigie to Japan had told the Japanese government of the importance of distributing Red Cross supplies in China and was trying to get the Japanese government to respond as soon as possible. Hannah, a Conservative Party member, asked about the Tianjin Anglo-Japanese Agreement. Butler replied that according to a report from the British Consul-General in Tianjin, the police agreement between Britain and Japan in Tianjin was progressing smoothly and that the provisions of the silver and currency agreement were being followed. Regarding silver, the two sides have agreed to sell silver worth approximately £100,000 to use the proceeds for disaster relief in North China, and the remaining silver will continue to be stored in the vaults of Chinese banks as usual. Hannah asked what the result of the representations to the Japanese government regarding the failure of local authorities in the Chinese occupied areas to stop anti-British movements. Butler replied that anti-British expressions are currently almost entirely limited to newspaper attacks. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Major Reshuffle of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls Abroad; Preparing for "Diplomatic Offensive"</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Foreign Minister has telegraphed 40 ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad to return home. It is said that this move may herald a large-scale reshuffle in preparation for a new "diplomatic offensive." It is reported that those recalled include five ambassadors, including the ambassadors to the United States, France, and Turkey, 19 ministers, and a number of consuls-general. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>The west coast of Europe, from the North Cape of Norway in the north to the Spanish border in the south, is now completely under the control of the German army. German planes can fly from all directions to bomb the British Isles, and all destinations are within 90 minutes of flight. What is particularly important is that not only can German bombers fly back to their bases after dropping bombs, but German fighters can also escort them. In other words, when the war in Poland broke out, Britain was only within the flight range of German bombers. After the war in France ended, Britain was within the flight range of German fighters. According to the opinions of most observers, Germany can use two strategies to fight against Britain, namely (1) sending troops to attack, and (2) blockade. Regarding blockade, three tactics can be used, namely (1) blockading the eastern and southern ports of Britain, (2) bombing the remaining ports to make them ineffective, and (3) using aircraft and submarines to attack British merchant ships. This situation will naturally change once Britain changes from defense to offense.</p>
<h3>British Air Minister Warns Citizens: Risk of Surprise Attacks is Considerable, It Is Not Advisable to Indulge in Complacency</h3>
<p>London – Air Minister Sinclair broadcast yesterday, warning citizens not to indulge in complacency, because the recent attacks on Britain were only part of the German heavy bomber fleet, and the danger of large-scale air raids has not yet passed. To thwart enemy incursions, it still depends on the vigilance and efforts of the people, and the temporary sacrifice of their comfort, even their rights and freedoms. All emergency plans restricting freedom must be revoked only after the tense situation has passed. We are deeply grateful for the spiritual sympathy and material assistance provided by the United States, but we must rely on ourselves. The more we rely on ourselves, the stronger our ability and determination will be, and the more assistance we will receive from abroad. Since August 8, Britain has lost a total of 194 aircraft in the defense of the country and air raids on German territory, while Germany has lost 709 aircraft. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>London – Captain Peel, who recently received the Flying Cross, recently told of the details of British aircraft bombing German territory, saying that the army assembly grounds in the Ham area, which are often mentioned in the Air Ministry’s communiqués, are actually frequently visited by British aircraft. There are many bombing targets in the Ruhr area. In the early stages of the war, the British Air Force only dropped leaflets over Germany. The value of this practice has now been discovered, as it is of great help in finding targets. The British Air Force has been practicing night flying for years, which the Germans are far from being able to match. Peel believes that Germany's blackout is very good, and the searchlights and anti-aircraft guns are very accurate, but the interception by German fighters is not a cause for concern. British aircraft are both good and solid, and can fly back even with holes in the fuselage. Peel finally mentioned the British air raids on Milan and Turin in Italy, saying that the Italian resistance was quite weak. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Arms Indian Shipping</h3>
<p>Rome – It was learned here today that Britain has once again armed ships sailing from India to England or British territories, equipping them with devices to defend against magnetic mines. It is understood that this measure was decided due to the Italian blockade of the British coast, the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>American Ship Carrying Overseas Chinese Far From German Mine Zone, Norwegian Crown Princess Also on Board</h3>
<p>Washington – The State Department announced that the American ship "Lyttelton" is carrying evacuated American overseas Chinese back home from the Scandinavian Peninsula. The Norwegian Crown Princess Märtha and her children are also traveling on the ship. The ship is currently about 400 miles west of the British coastline, far from the danger zone that the Germans claim to have mined. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>German Air Force Divides into Small Squads, Widely Attacks Various Parts of Britain, Targeting Airfields and Munitions Factories, British Aircraft Also Fly to Bomb German Territory</h3>
<p>London – According to responsible sources, yesterday German aircraft in small squads attacked a wide area of Britain, such as the Midlands, Wales, the coastal areas, and the northeast and southeast of England. As a result, 13 German aircraft were shot down, and the British also lost two fighter planes, one of whose pilot parachuted down safely. According to the Air Ministry’s communiqué, the German aircraft that attacked Britain continuously yesterday were either single aircraft or operated in small squads, and the number of attacks was quite high. Some even penetrated inland to attack. The targets of some German aircraft were clearly British Air Force airfields. Only the dormitory of one airfield was damaged by bombing, and the rest were unharmed. Among the aircraft lost by the Germans, three Dornier 17s were shot down by Spitfire British fighter planes five miles inland from the northeast coast. One of them crashed with a broken wing, and the crew parachuted out and were captured. In the skies over the southeast, a British fighter plane shot down a Junkers 88 German aircraft, which crashed near a town. The British pilot landed to inspect and found that all five German crew members were dead. Towns in the east and south of England and the Midlands were bombed, and houses were damaged in several places, with minor casualties. Residents of a residential area were also strafed. In addition, an enemy aircraft dived down from the clouds and dropped a huge bomb on a town in the southeast, destroying six houses and eight residences. It is feared that some people were killed. Two German aircraft bombed a town in Lincolnshire, causing very little material damage and no casualties. Both aircraft were shot down. In addition, a town in the Midlands was attacked by a German aircraft, which dived down and dropped a bomb, killing and injuring several people, including children. At the same time, another enemy aircraft attacked a town on the east coast, opening fire and strafing the streets. A town on the southeast coast was also attacked by an enemy aircraft, which dropped a bomb that landed on the road, bursting a water pipe. The aircraft circled twice and strafed the streets. After some German aircraft were shot down, the crew parachuted out. Near a village, three German pilots landed. Two surrendered to the farmers, and the third, seeing a farmer's wife and her 14-year-old son approaching with rifles, shouted "Spare me!" The farmer's wife then offered him tea and dressed his wounds before handing him over to the authorities. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry's communiqué stated that the scale of enemy aircraft activity last night was not large. German aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs in two places in southeastern England. The gas and waterworks of a coastal city suffered some damage. A bomb landed on the foothills in southeastern Scotland, injuring only one person. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, due to bad weather, air combat over England was quieter. The British side claimed that air raids on German territory were quite successful, and they are still on the offensive against Germany. More than 100 German aircraft carried out "hit-and-run" air raids over England all day long. British airfields and other targets were bombed, and some civilians were killed and injured by broken tiles and rubble. However, British bombers immediately retaliated, inflicting heavy damage on a German destroyer. Many German airfields were also damaged. At dusk, about 15 German aircraft flying solo or in small groups were shot down by the British. (International Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Yesterday morning, German Henkel aircraft conducted a large-scale armed reconnaissance flight over Britain. Several factories in central England and some commercial ports on the east coast were bombed. Five aircraft parked at an airfield were destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – A German aircraft squadron flew to Britain to conduct armed reconnaissance. According to the squadron leader, German aircraft bombed the Memphis airfield at low altitude, destroying several aircraft. The barracks were also hit, and the armory was also destroyed. The Remington airfield was destroyed. Several British aircraft about to take off and many airfield hit, the German aircraft immediately took cover in the clouds, and the details of the bombing were not seen. The German aircraft did not encounter the British aircraft's resistance, and the British anti-aircraft fire also failed to hinder the German aircraft's activities. The German aircraft have safely returned to their base. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>German Troops Shell British Convoy</p>
<p>London – Today, when a convoy passed through the Strait of Dover, German positions on the French coast opened fire and shelled it. This is the first time since the war began that coastal positions have shelled British ships in the English Channel. The shelling lasted for about 80 minutes. The convoy has safely passed through the channel without any losses. This move by the Germans was obviously a complete failure, and the flashes of their artillery fire were enough to reveal the location of their positions. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – German newsreels have included long-range guns shelling Britain. Gun batteries have been deployed along the coast, ready to bombard the opposite shore of the English Channel. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – According to fishermen's reports, a British convoy was attacked by German aircraft off the northeast coast this morning. It is now believed that none of the ships were hit. The escort ship opened fire and bombarded the German aircraft. Later, a British Spitfire fighter plane appeared and drove the German aircraft away. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>British Air Force Day Raids on German Airfields</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry's communiqué stated that in the past 24 hours, British Air Force bombers carried out day raids, with their main target being airfields in German-occupied areas. British coastal aircraft also attacked two German destroyers in the North Sea, one of which was damaged. No British aircraft were lost. On Monday night, the weather was bad, so British aircraft did not fly to German territory to bomb. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Germany Announces Air Force Battle Results</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon's German military report stated that yesterday German aircraft attacked as many as 15 British airfields, and also bombed many military ports, railways, and industrial institutions. Factories in Skagen, Great Yarmouth, Weimar, Coventry, and Bournemouth, as well as port works in Bridlington, were hit. A ship in Southampton docks was hit by a bomb. When German aircraft bombed convoys near the east coast of Britain, a merchant ship was hit several times. Last night, German aircraft attacked aircraft manufacturing plants in southeastern England and armories near Brighton. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs in northern Germany last night, causing very little damage. Yesterday, enemy aircraft lost seven aircraft, and six German aircraft were missing. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hamburg – After enemy aircraft flew over northern Germany last night, they reappeared over Hamburg and were finally repelled by German anti-aircraft fire. Several bombs landed in the northeastern suburbs of Hamburg, causing no major damage. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Germany Concentrates Large Number of Steamships</p>
<p>London – Conservative observers here point out that Germany may launch a desperate offensive around August 27 or 28. According to naval sources, the German leader will take advantage of the dark period of this month to smuggle troops in the dark of night. The Germans have concentrated a large number of steamships in the Baltic Sea, almost outside the normal reconnaissance range of British reconnaissance planes. According to new information, a large number of flat-bottomed boats have been assembled across from Dover, ready to transport tanks and other small armored vehicles for landing. However, the British Air Force claims to have inflicted heavy damage on these ships. Meteorologists say that, theoretically speaking, the weather will not be unfavorable to Hitler before the autumnal equinox on September 21, so Hitler can start the attack before September 21. In short, according to observers, the various conditions for a large-scale invasion of Britain before January have not changed, except that the British Air Force is superior in its operations against the German Air Force.

<h3>Mediterranean Situation: Italian Air Force Active Again, Malta and Gibraltar Under Surprise Attack, Italy Claims to Have Sunk British Submarine</h3>
<p>Malta – Enemy aircraft attacked on Wednesday afternoon. Anti-aircraft guns opened fire and bombarded them, and fighter planes also took off to intercept them. Seeing this, the enemy aircraft retreated without dropping bombs. According to recent information, the government property and a British Air Force airfield were slightly damaged in the enemy air raid on Tuesday. Military and civilian property also suffered slight losses. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Gibraltar – When General Grant, Governor of Algeciras in Spanish territory, came here to formally call on Governor Liddell, the atmosphere was extremely harmonious. The welcoming banquet, which was originally scheduled to last 40 minutes, was extended to an hour and a half. Liddell raised his glass to toast General Franco, and Grant also raised his glass to toast the King of England. Although the visit was a normal courtesy after the new governor took office, Grant's visit has a special relationship in the current situation. Spaniards near the border say that the friendliness of the two governors' contact shows that General Franco is now pursuing a policy of expressing his efforts not to be succumbed to German invasion. When General Grant and others arrived by ship, they were displeased to hear the British firing a 21-gun salute, as it is customary not to fire salutes in wartime. Liddell will visit Algeciras next week to return the call. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Gibraltar – Gibraltar was bombed yesterday, hitting the fortress's cannons and armory, causing a fire. The British anti-aircraft artillery shot down an aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome – Today, the Information Conference here announced that Italian aircraft bombed enemy fleets in the Eastern Mediterranean yesterday, including two 10,000-ton cruisers, four 5,000-ton light cruisers, and two torpedo boats. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Gibraltar – Gibraltar was attacked by two consecutive waves of Italian aircraft last night. One Italian aircraft was shot down into the sea. During the second air raid, bombs fell on the rocks and caught fire, but were quickly extinguished. Material losses were minor, and there were no casualties. During the first attack, all the bombs fell into the sea. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian military headquarters issued a war report this afternoon stating that our aircraft bombed military targets in Malta and Gibraltar. One aircraft did not return to base. Our torpedo boats sank an enemy submarine in the Eastern Mediterranean. Our aircraft bombed and hit two cruisers in the enemy naval fleet, which included many heavy cruisers. Our aircraft all safely returned to their original defenses. In East Africa, indigenous troops shot down a British aircraft in Kenya. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Cairo – According to British reports, Italian aircraft dropped bombs on Alexandria this morning. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italian-Greek Relations Extremely Tense, Greek Army Actively Preparing for War, Greek Government Declares Neutrality, Italian Aircraft Lands in Greek Territory</h3>
<p>Athens – Since the sinking of the Greek destroyer "Helle," tensions between Italy and Greece reached their peak yesterday. According to reliable sources, Italian mobile troops have recently concentrated on the Albanian and Greek borders. There is no indication of Greek mobilization, but government sources indicate that it may be announced within days. A Greek military spokesman told the Associated Press yesterday morning that Greek defenses on the Albanian-Greek border were considered inadequate. Reliable sources have reported that an Italian aircraft was forced to land on Tuesday night in Eleusis, 15 miles west of Athens, where Greece's largest armory is located. It is reported that the five pilots of the aircraft have been detained. Currently, the number of Italian air force personnel detained by Greece is 27. After naval experts examined the fragments of the bomb that sank the "Helle" on Tuesday, they stated that one fragment was engraved with the words "Turin 1930." Tensions between Italy and Greece worsened after Hoxha, an Albanian advocate for the return of lost territories, was assassinated by Greeks in Albania. Hoxha's death occurred after Italian official and semi-official newspapers launched a major anti-Greek propaganda campaign. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, has repeatedly claimed that the Italian government attaches great importance to this incident and will demand full satisfaction from the Greek government. Albanian newspapers with Italian backing also participated in the anti-Greek campaign, claiming that Albanians in Greece are being mistreated and demanding that Greece cede its Epirus province to Albania. Some people here believe that Italy will soon formally demand that the Greek government cede Epirus province and other Greek territories to Albania. Official sources remain silent about the recent attack on two Greek destroyers by Italian aircraft. The sailors of the two ships said that the aircraft were undoubtedly Italian. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Athens – The Greek government issued an order today, summoning reservists from the 1934 class, who must report by September 4. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Athens – The Greek army has canceled all holidays. Officers on holiday have received orders to immediately return to camp and cancel their holidays. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Cairo – After a meeting with the Chief of Staff and the Minister of National Defense, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas declared that Greece has decided to maintain neutrality and will rise up and fight if the country's independence and territorial integrity are threatened. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome – Fascist party members recently believed that Britain and Greece were conspiring to attack Albania. Authoritative sources said that the Italian-Greek situation remains delicate until Greece responds to the Italian views expressed by Grazzi, the Italian ambassador to Greece. Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, recently said that Greece is undoubtedly under pressure and is taking provocative actions, but these actions may cost Greece a great deal. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome – Authoritative sources recently said that the delicate relations between Italy and Greece remained unchanged yesterday. Although the Italian army's rapid victory in British Somaliland made it easier for some to resolve the issue arising from Hoxha's assassination, the path to resolving the Italian-Greek issue is still very far. Since the meeting between Italian Minister to Greece Grazzi and Greek Prime Minister Metaxas last week, the two countries have neither exchanged opinions diplomatically nor exchanged documents. The current situation seems to be that Italy is waiting to see how Greece will react. According to comments in the Italian press with informed sources, the difficulties between Italy and Greece are centered on the following two points: First, the issue of the demands of Albanian irredentists for the return of Albanian territories in Chameria and the resolution of the issue of the Greek Kunelian territories; Second, the abolition of the British guidance system in Greece. In resolving the issue, Greece must weigh the importance of these two points. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – Foreign Secretary Butler replied in writing in the Lower House yesterday that the British government was unaware that Italy had demanded that Greece cede Corfu Island. Corfu Island is the largest island in the Ionian Islands in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Romania and Bulgaria Agree to Cede Dobruja, Restore 1912 Border, Bulgarian Troops Approach Dobruja Area</h3>
<p>Bucharest – The Romanian and Bulgarian delegations have agreed on an agreement on Dobruja in Craiova. As a result, Romania will lose another strip of territory. Dobruja originally belonged to Bulgaria and was annexed by Romania at the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913. Now Romania and Bulgaria have agreed to draw a new border in the area and the 1912 border line. The territory ceded by Romania to Bulgaria includes the two provinces of Durostorum and Caliacra. Bulgarian troops have approached Dobruja to prepare to enter the new territory immediately upon the signing of the new agreement and occupy it completely within three hours, and then establish a Bulgarian administrative agency to prevent incidents. Technical difficulties regarding the exchange of people and compensation are currently being negotiated. The completion of these procedures will take about two weeks. The agreement just reached between Romania and Bulgaria stipulates that Bulgaria will repatriate all Romanians in Dobruja and 50,000 Romanian expatriates in Bulgaria. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Craiova – According to Haitong News Agency special correspondent Sass, the Romanian-Bulgarian talks continued yesterday according to plan. Both Romania and Bulgaria have strictly kept silent about the progress of the talks, but it is generally felt that the issue of Romania ceding southern Dobruja to restore the old borders of 1913 has been agreed upon in principle in the early stages of the talks. Currently, only technical issues such as the relocation of Romanian people and Bulgaria's compensation for Romanian investments are being discussed. Political figures pointed out that the Romanian-Bulgarian talks may continue for two weeks, or it may not be known. Almost all journalists left Craiova yesterday, as there will be no important news from the Romanian-Bulgarian conference in the near future. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Craiova – According to a special reporter from Haitong News Agency in Craiova, yesterday was the third day of the Romanian-Bulgarian talks, and two important issues were discussed: (1) the withdrawal of Romanian military personnel from southern Dobruja; (2) the transfer of minority ethnic groups between Romania and Bulgaria. No decisions have been made as a result of the discussions. Southern Dobruja must be occupied after Romania withdraws. The transfer of minority ethnic groups is a large-scale issue. 100,000 Bulgarians will move from Romania to Bulgaria, while 67,000 Romanians will move from Bulgaria to Romania. This issue was previously discussed in the Salzburg talks. According to reliable sources, the opinions currently being contested by the two sides include the following three points: (1) Romania requires Bulgarians to be forcibly relocated, while Romanians are voluntarily relocated. Bulgaria, on the other hand, demands equal treatment; (2) Romania hopes that the withdrawal deadline will be set at three months, but Bulgaria believes that half a month to a month is sufficient; (3) Bulgaria believes that Romania's request for compensation for the transfer of property is too high. In short, although Romania and Bulgaria have already agreed in principle on the talks, it is difficult to expect the agreement to be signed until the above three points of view are not agreed upon.

<h3>Hungarian-Romanian Talks Encounter Setbacks, Divergent Opinions Between Two Sides</h3>
<p>Budapest – Count Holly, head of the Hungarian delegation, has returned to Turnu Severin to continue negotiations with the Romanian side. However, the proposals put forward by the two sides differ greatly. It is believed that a solution cannot be reached unless Germany intervenes. Informed observers believe that German intervention may take the form of exerting informal pressure in Bucharest and Budapest. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Sofia – According to Bulgarian newspapers, new difficulties have arisen in the negotiations between Hungary and Romania. According to the "Utro" and "Sula" newspapers, the opinions of the two governments are absolutely divergent, and the negotiations may have no results. The "Utro" newspaper also stated that Hungary is demanding 65,000 square kilometers of territory, but Romania is only willing to cede 13,000 square kilometers of territory, and Romanian officials believe that this is the highest concession. The newspaper further stated that the negotiations have broken down. According to another report in the "Sula" newspaper, the Hungarian side believes that even if the negotiations continue, they may not be effective, as the opinions of the two sides are absolutely divergent. (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<p>Budapest – According to newspapers here, Hungarian chief representative Holly returned here from Severin and immediately visited Foreign Minister Csáky. Ujesszaszky, a military expert of the Hungarian delegation, also accompanied him on the visit. Cabinet Prime Minister Teleki also went to the Foreign Ministry to listen to the report. Holly is scheduled to continue discussions with the Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon, and then return to Severin today with new instructions to conduct negotiations. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Regarding the negotiations between Romania and Hungary on the cession of territory, officials here hope that the negotiations can overcome minor issues and achieve a peaceful resolution. At present, the two sides are still reviewing and considering each other's proposals, but there is no doubt that the negotiations can proceed smoothly. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>British Commander in the Middle East Warns Soldiers: Many Thorns Ahead, Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Cairo - Lieutenant General Wavell, Commander of the British Forces in the Middle East, broadcasted to the British troops last night, reviewing the war situation. He stated that Britain would ultimately achieve victory in the current struggle. The current war situation is tense and now is the moment to strive for victory. The future is still distant, and there are many thorns ahead. He recalled that in 1805, Britain fought independently and regained freedom for Europe. Today, we must do it again. The Middle East has many tasks to accomplish in the final victory, and we are also prepared to fulfill them. Soldiers may feel weary after waiting here for a long time, but he could tell the soldiers that our position here is very important. We will have many tasks soon. Although the rebel army has achieved local victories in a small part of a very long border, the British believe that the British forces in the Middle East will surely achieve the final victory, just as the British troops will be able to defend the British Isles.

<h3>Britain and the United States Decide to Adopt a Parallel Policy in Diplomacy; US-Canada Joint Defense is the Initial Step in Cooperation; No Extensive Links in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Washington - Political observers here have been commenting on President Roosevelt's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King and the decision to establish a joint defense committee, saying that this is the first step in close cooperation between Britain and the United States. Furthermore, British Prime Minister Churchill announced yesterday in the House of Commons that the British government has decided to lease its sea and land military bases in the Atlantic territories to the United States for defense. It seems that there is almost no possibility of conflict between Britain and the United States in the next hundred years, and Britain's decision to adopt an "absolute parallelism" with the United States in diplomacy can also be seen from this. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - Acting Secretary of State Welles told the press here yesterday that when British Prime Minister Churchill mentioned the British-American agreement on Pacific islands in his speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday, he was only referring to the use of Canton Island and Enderbury Island as naval bases. Welles said that there is currently no agreement or negotiation on other Pacific islands. All the facts of the Canton and Enderbury Islands agreement have been disclosed in the public announcement. He said that this agreement cannot be regarded as an extensive connection between the two countries in the entire Pacific, as some people interpret Churchill's words. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - Authorities here have recently denied reports that the United States and Britain had discussed leasing Canton Island and Enderbury Island to the United States for fifty years, saying that in April 1939, the two governments decided to jointly manage the islands for fifty years. The reported information is probably a misrepresentation. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - According to a telegram from London, the South Pacific islands, Canton and Enderbury Islands, have now been leased to the United States as air force bases for a term of fifty years. Regarding the aforementioned islands, a year ago, Britain and the United States had a dispute, and the result was joint management, which ended the dispute. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Defense of the Americas Begins</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt will return to the White House today to begin his work of defending the Americas from European aggression. The administrative leader will proceed with the US side's affairs regarding the US-Canada Joint Defense Committee agreed upon with Canadian Prime Minister King, and will continue negotiations with the British on the construction of bases in British territories in the Western Hemisphere. He will also consider the possibility of transferring fifty old US destroyers to Britain. President Roosevelt will refer to the opinions of senior naval and army leaders on the above issues. The opinion letters of senior military leaders have been submitted to the President's office before his return, awaiting selection. Four cabinet members met with military leaders yesterday to discuss whether it is legal for the United States to build bases in other countries' territories. US officials have repeatedly stated that the US granting destroyers to Britain and Britain leasing bases to the US are not related to each other, but they cannot avoid thinking that there are some mutual relationships. Isolationists are increasingly opposed to the US giving destroyers to Britain, believing that British Prime Minister Churchill is luring the United States into the war. Even some who agree with the President's foreign policy are advising the President to be cautious. However, Speaker of the House Bankhead has declared that the House and the people of the country have a significant feeling and want to acquire sea and air bases. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - US Attorney General Jackson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson, Under Secretary of State Welles, and Chiefs of Staff of the Navy and Army, etc., consulted several times yesterday on the legal issues regarding the construction of military bases by the United States in other countries' territories. Jackson cut short his vacation and rushed back to Washington to participate in this meeting, which shows the considerable importance of the meeting. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Canada Responsible for Defending Newfoundland</p>
<p>St. John's, Newfoundland - The joint defense conference held here by representatives of Canada and Newfoundland ended last night. All points discussed were agreed upon. The defense of Newfoundland was fully considered, and special attention was paid to Newfoundland's position as the first line of defense for the North American hemisphere. The Canadian representatives in the meeting stated emphatically that the meeting did not raise issues involving the sovereignty or independence of Newfoundland. It is heard that Canada has agreed to bear full responsibility for the defense of Newfoundland, and the Newfoundland authorities have agreed. The British government announced that it would lease defense bases to the United States, which Newfoundland is very concerned about. If American soldiers are sent here, the residents will sincerely welcome them. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Deny Military Alliance</p>
<p>Washington - People here claim that the news from London on the American side, saying that Britain and the United States have begun discussing a military alliance, is unfounded. The discussion regarding Canada is based solely on the possibility of the Western Hemisphere being attacked in the future, and does not imply the intention of the United States to participate in the war at this stage. The rumor that British-American talks have gone beyond their announced purpose is now making the US government uneasy. Therefore, President Roosevelt stated emphatically that the US-Canada defense meeting is purely a planning group. Under Secretary of State Welles also said that Churchill's criticism of the British-American understanding on Pacific bases, if considered to imply that Britain and the United States have agreed on a cooperation plan in this region and will replicate it in the Atlantic, is a misunderstanding. Some have echoed the claim that a British-American alliance is being discussed, but the State Department replied that there is absolutely no way to know. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - According to people here, Britain and the United States had reached an understanding on Pacific air bases long before the outbreak of the war. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - The British Foreign Office has formally denied the news of a military alliance between Britain, Greece, and the United States, saying that the news is unfounded. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japan Watches Anglo-American Plans</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated in its editorial today that the Japanese government is paying attention to the Anglo-American schemes in the Pacific and will not allow any changes to the status quo in the Pacific. The newspaper, in criticizing British Prime Minister Churchill's statement on the common interests of Britain and the United States in the Pacific islands, said that if there are any changes to the status quo in the Pacific, the Japanese government will take "appropriate and effective measures." The newspaper condemned the British and American plans to make major changes to the status quo in the Pacific in violation of the Four-Power Treaty. If the United States adopts this attitude, it will destroy the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the United States will be deemed to have withdrawn its protests to Japan regarding the China Incident. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>To Maintain Peace in the Far East, It Depends on the Existence of China; US Military Officer Discusses Far East Policy, Saying No Compromise Will Be Made</h3>
<p>Manila - Carlsen, a retired US naval officer who served as a special US military observer in the Chinese army for eighteen months, told reporters here that the new trend in US Far East policy is anti-appeasement. Carlsen said that the United States will not adopt a compromise policy, for fear that South American countries will feel that the United States is weak and will not cooperate with the United States. South American countries now seem to have a view that "if the United States sells China to protect itself, then in the future, if we are threatened by external forces, we will be treated in the same way." Carlsen continued that whether Japan will take further action in the East is now waiting for the result of Germany's attack on Britain. If Britain fails, Japan will advance south. French Indochina is very dangerous. However, whether Japan will conquer the Dutch East Indies and Malaya will depend on the attitude of the United States. In commenting on China's pro-Soviet stance, Carlsen warned against those who generally believe that Chinese communism is the same as Soviet communism, and refuted their claims, saying that Chinese communism should not be opposed, because Chinese communism is actually democracy. Chinese communism, in the economic aspect, advocates the equitable distribution of wealth, and in the social aspect, strives for the equality of all people. This kind of communism is the practice of Christianity, but without Christianity as a religion. To maintain peace in the Far East and maintain the democracy of the Philippines depends on the existence of a free China. If China falls into the hands of the Japanese, then Asia will be controlled by fascism. Carlsen resigned from the US Navy last year in order to express his views on the Far East issue. Carlsen plans to tour the Philippine Islands before going to China and will give several more speeches. (United Press, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Finland and the Soviet Union Establish Consolidated Relations; Finnish Premier Reports on Radio</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Finnish Prime Minister Ryti stated in a radio broadcast yesterday that the main provisions of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty have been implemented. The instruments of ratification of the peace treaty have been exchanged, and the new border has been established. As for the Soviet-Finnish trade agreement signed under the peace treaty, it has greatly improved the trade relations between the two countries. The Kemijärvi-Kandalaksha railway is under construction (the Soviet section has been completed), and railway transportation between the two countries will be greatly improved. Postal, telephone, and telegraph services have also been restored. The Soviet government has also agreed to transfer all records and documents from the ceded areas to Finland. If the Finnish people in the ceded areas genuinely wish to return to Finland, the Soviet government can also do so. On the other hand, the Finnish government has accepted the proposal to demilitarize the Åland Islands. In short, the relations between the Soviet Union and Finland have been consolidated.

<h3>British Government's Relationship with Poland; Butler Answers Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London - When the House of Commons met yesterday, someone asked about the relationship between the British and Polish governments. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that there is the closest cooperation between the two countries on all military matters, including foreign policy issues. Since last September, the Polish government has stated that they only consider the Soviet Union's violation of the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact to have put them at war with the Soviet Union. As for Poland's relations with other countries, he made a statement on August 15 saying that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax was not prepared to take responsibility for reporting on the relations between an independent government and other foreign governments. Communist MP Gletcher rose to ask: Given that the only center from which the Polish government can wage war against the Soviet Union is Britain, will the Undersecretary consider this to hinder Britain's desire to improve relations with the Soviet Union? In his reply, Butler pointed out that Mr. Gletcher already knows that Britain has the desire to improve relations with the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Allied Forces Act; British Undersecretary of War Proposes a Motion</h3>
<p>London - British Undersecretary of War Grigg stated last night when moving the second reading of the Allied Forces Act in the House of Commons that this act would allow foreign governments that support British doctrine to undertake their due work. Foreign governments in Britain should not all be regarded as governments in exile, as they each want to undertake something in the war within a certain range. There are now no fewer than six foreign armies established in Britain, trained under their own flags, commanders, and military laws. The British government is willing to find a way to give it legal approval. In principle, this army is at all times under the command of the British Supreme Commander, and in wartime, it can be commanded by its own officers under British control, and in peacetime, it is also taught by British instructors so that it is familiar with British weapons and British habits. This bill provides for the establishment of the necessary mechanisms for implementing various foreign laws and stipulates the actions of the British civil authorities in matters such as arresting deserters and detaining and convicting foreign soldiers. This bill contains the new birth of freedom and represents the inner wishes of at least 100 million people currently under the Nazi iron heel, so I hope the House of Commons will pass it.

<h3>Earthquake in Italy</h3>
<h3>Local and Foreign Residents of this City Hope US to Take Over Defense of Central District; US Government Advocates Local Resolution; Business Corps on Duty Diligently for Days</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the takeover of defense in Area B of the International Settlement, although the International Business Corps has temporarily taken over, this is only a transitional measure and not a long-term solution. Chinese and foreign residents alike earnestly hope that the US military can take over the defense of the area, as the US has strictly adhered to a neutral stance in both European and Far Eastern wars, without bias or resentment. However, due to Japan's insistence on its own views, the US military is temporarily guarding its original defense zone, pending negotiation and compromise between Washington and Tokyo before a final decision is made. According to news from diplomatic circles related to the valley, the matter has now been instructed by Washington to the US Ambassador in Tokyo and the commander of its Asian Fleet, instructing them to resolve it locally. Pending an agreement, the status quo will be maintained by the International Business Corps.</p>
<p>Business Corps US Team Recruits Members</p>
<p>Since the White Russian and British teams of the International Business Corps took over Area D, which was left by the retreating British troops, their limited number has created an immediate need for expansion. Yesterday, the commander of the US team, Aleman, issued an order urging all team members to encourage their relatives and friends to actively participate in the Business Corps. It is said that the new recruit training season for the US team in October will adopt new-style military drills, and it is hoped that the US Navy's Mai Ling team will provide instructors. Business Corps members will practice target shooting next month, with long-range shooting scheduled for September 2nd and short-range shooting for September 25th, both from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM. All team members participating in the target shooting must gather at the International Business Corps drill hall inside the Municipal Council Building at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>B-Troop to Take Over Tonight</p>
<p>The English-language "Great US Evening Post" reports that A-Troop of the International Business Corps is currently responsible for the defense of the Bingbei area in the "B" defense zone. It is expected that B-Troop will take over from A-Troop tomorrow (the 23rd, i.e., today) evening. It is believed that the Business Corps will continue to be stationed in the "B" defense zone until the US-Japan negotiations on the former British military defense zone in the Public Concession reach a final solution. A Japanese naval spokesman stated yesterday at a press conference that the authorities have not yet announced any news of US-Japan government talks on the Shanghai defense zone issue, so he cannot say where the talks will take place. Although he does not know whether the talks will be held in Washington or Tokyo, there is no reason to believe that the US and Japan are not negotiating.</p>
<p>Strict Discipline and Devotion to Duty</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that A-Troop of the Shanghai International Business Corps received a notification on the 21st, urging them to prepare immediately. At 8:00 PM that night, they took over the defense of the West Hongkou area in the "B" defense zone from the First Battalion of the British West Forth Highlanders. Officers and 51 soldiers were selected from the Jia Company, Yi Company, Scottish Team, and Light Machine Gun Team of A-Troop to be stationed in the West Hongkou area. These individuals are disciplined and devoted to their duties.</p>
<p>Another Batch of Team Members Sent to Alternate</p>
<p>After staying for 24 hours, another batch of team members from the same company relieved them yesterday (the 21st) at 8:00 PM. It is expected that another batch of team members will be sent to alternate tonight (the 22nd). It is difficult to know for sure how long this approach will last, but if the current approach continues to be implemented, then all team members of A-Troop, or at least the team members of the above four companies, will be sent to work for 24 hours every three or four days.</p>
<p>Entire Plan Temporary in Nature</p>
<p>The meals for the team members stationed in the West Hongkou area yesterday were transported by the International Business Corps truck. As for whether B-Troop of the Business Corps will take over from A-Troop in the future, it is not yet known, as the entire plan is temporary in nature and will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the US and Japanese authorities. However, it can be asserted that A-Troop will temporarily assume this duty.</p>
<p>Team Members Leaving Work to Serve on Duty</p>
<p>It is understood that the Business Corps team members stationed in the West Hongkou area are all doing business in this city. It is impossible to determine how long it will take for them to leave their jobs to serve on duty, so it cannot be said with certainty what impact their leaving their jobs will have on the various businesses they work for. However, since only ninety-six people are dispatched on duty each day, the current approach, even if it lasts for a long time, will not greatly affect the businesses to which the team members belong.</p>
<p>Current Approach Slightly Inconvenient</p>
<p>If the US and Japanese authorities continue negotiations on the takeover of the "B" defense zone for several weeks, it is expected that the team members of B-Troop of the Business Corps will also be called out to take over the duties of the team members of B-Troop. If so, the impact on various businesses due to the call-up of employees will be slightly reduced. According to several businesses, if the current Business Corps takeover approach is permanently implemented, then there is no doubt that various businesses in this city will feel slightly inconvenienced. However, the duration of the current approach has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Hepburn Concerned About Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>Admiral Hepburn, commander of the US Asian Fleet, left Shanghai on the private yacht Isopel after the "B" district defense issue in this port was temporarily resolved. It was learned yesterday that he had arrived safely in Qingdao to continue his summer vacation. It is said that Admiral Hepburn is still extremely concerned about the situation in Shanghai and is deeply worried. The US ships Lake Ontario and others docked in the Huangpu River, and the flagship of the Asian Fleet stationed in North China, are in close contact with each other, communicating news by radio every day.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Speech, British Overseas Chinese Respond</h3>
<p>Since British Prime Minister Churchill reported on the war situation in the House of Commons on Tuesday and reiterated his determination to resist the war, the news spread, and the British expatriates in this port expressed their excitement. Yesterday, the "China Mail" published a slogan for a British expatriate wartime voluntary donation association, excerpting Churchill's speech, which stated, "As a result of British aircraft setting off to bomb military targets, the bombing of enemy military industrial transportation aircraft bases and military depots will continue on an expanded scale, and in the year to come, it will reach a level unimaginable before the end of the war. This is the most reliable way to achieve victory." In the end, it was encouraged that overseas Chinese should immediately send donations to HSBC and the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China to purchase aircraft to subsidize the British government's war effort.</p>

The Hao Sheng Steamer is currently docked at floating pontoons 12 and 13, and the painting has been completed. The De Sheng Steamer arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at noon the day before yesterday, carrying British troops.</p>
<p>All British Troops Embarking Today</p>
<p>First, it docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, and then at 4:45 PM, it moved to the Yangshupu Ruirong Shipyard Wharf. The luggage and baggage of the British troops stationed in Shanghai began to be transported and loaded onto the Yong Sheng and Hao Sheng Steamers yesterday morning. All British troops can embark today. After the British troops embark, the three steamers will set sail at the same time. It is heard that the British Navy authorities dispatched multiple warships to provide protection along the way.</p>
<p>Officers and Dependents Depart Tomorrow</p>
<p>There is also a group of officers and dependents who will take the Great Britain Company's Danda Steamer to Hong Kong. The steamer returned to Shanghai from Japan at 8:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It was originally scheduled to go to Hong Kong next Monday but has been moved forward to tomorrow (the 24th) to leave Shanghai and go straight to Hong Kong. The dependents of British officers will land in Hong Kong, stay there briefly, and then transfer to Singapore.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Report Withdrawal Situation</p>
<p>The English-language "Great US Evening Post" reports that reliable sources heard this morning (the 22nd) that the withdrawal of British troops from this city will be completed on Sunday. The remaining British troops still in Shanghai will depart from the barracks on that day, board a British transport ship, and set off for Hong Kong and Singapore. The name of the troop transport ship that will carry the British troops away from Shanghai is not yet known, but it is generally believed to be the former Great Britain Company's Natrnda Steamer. The British troops of the East Surrey Regiment and the West Forth Highlanders, less than 300 people, who left Shanghai first, boarded the De Sheng Steamer yesterday (the 21st) and have already left port today to go to Hong Kong. In addition, the De Sheng Steamer also carries small detachments of British troops withdrawn from Peiping and Tianjin last week and several mechanized units formerly stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jinhua, Yiwu, and Sheng County Bombed Again; Japanese Warships Opened Fire, All Shots Fell on Beach</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang League in Shanghai received the following telegram from Eastern Zhejiang: At 12:53 PM the day before yesterday, four Japanese aircraft were spotted over Shaoxing, passed through Zhuji, and circled over Zhuji for a long time.

<h3>Body of Cheng Zhengzhang to be Placed in Coffin Today; Central Leaders Send Condolences by Telegram; Also Send Funeral Gifts of More Than 4,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhengzhang, the international editor of the "Great US Evening Post," was suddenly attacked by thugs at the intersection of West Aihams Road and Jin Shenfu Road at around 9:00 AM on the 19th. He was seriously injured at the time and was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Although the doctors provided careful treatment and transfused blood twice, he was unable to recover due to his serious injuries and passed away on the evening of the day before yesterday at 8:05 PM. The body was moved from Guangci Hospital to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The colleagues of the "Great US Evening Post" also organized a funeral committee to handle everything and scheduled the coffin to be placed today at 2:00 PM. The coffin will be temporarily stored in the International Funeral Home, pending the selection of a burial site.

<h3>Electricity Company Reduces Surcharges; Electricity Reduced by 19%; Other Electricity by 35%</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession previously increased prices after being approved by the Public Concession Municipal Council because the original electricity fee was difficult to maintain operations due to the rapid contraction of foreign exchange. Now, the exchange rate is stable, so a notice is issued to reduce prices. Yesterday, a notice was issued to users within the concession stating that with the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Water Company, the temporary surcharges that should be added to the bills of ordinary users whose electricity use ends within September of this year are as follows: Electricity: 161.76% (the company's June notice was 180.97%), ordinary electric power, electric heating, cooking, and water heating: 281.01% (the June notice was 316.12%). Therefore, it is calculated that electricity prices have been reduced by 19.21%, and other electricity prices have been reduced by 35.19%.</p>
<h3>Bank of England Notes; Ban on Importing into England; Must be Sent to England Before August 27; and Must be Mailed by a Proper Bank</h3>
<p>Reuters Shanghai, 22nd, News: The British Embassy today issued a formal document stating that the plan to ban the import of Bank of England notes into England has now been promulgated. This sacrifice order does not affect the normal transfer of British gold through banks, and transfers can still be made in accordance with the current method. In order to give holders of British banknotes the opportunity to obtain the value of their banknotes, the following rules are stipulated: however, the time limit for implementing this method has to be short and cannot be extended for a long time, so those who want to use this method are still hoping to do so immediately. (1) Bank of England banknotes handed over to banks in China before business hours on August 27 can be credited to the bank's account when they are received in England, subject to the following conditions: (A) The banknotes must be sent by the bank from the post office in China before midnight on August 27; (B) The total number of banknotes sent by each bank must be telegraphed by the sending bank to the English manager of its head office before the start of business on August 28. Each batch of banknotes must be accompanied by a letter from the sending bank stating whether this batch of banknotes is part or all of the amount telegraphed. (2) Banknotes sent from China to England that are already in transit can be accepted. (3) As usual, the sender is responsible for the risk of any banknotes sent. (4) Those sent out in violation of these conditions will not be collected in England. Except for those sent by proper and recognized banks to their managers in England, banknotes sent by private individuals or any institutions will not be credited to the account when they arrive in England.</p>
<h3>The Far East Crisis and the Strengthening of US Policy; The Shanghai Situation Should Promote the Activeness of the United States; British Concessions to Japan Increase the Crisis in the Far East</h3>
<p>The editorial in the Millard's Review, to be published tomorrow, discusses the recent crisis caused by the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai and believes that the United States should strengthen its Far Eastern policy. The full text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The crisis caused by the withdrawal of British defense forces from Shanghai may cause the United States to no longer hesitate about its huge interests in the Far East, and to make a decisive decision on Far Eastern policy. The problems in Shanghai include the safety of the lives of thousands of Americans and other foreign expatriates; and the tens of thousands of Chinese who are in danger due to the stagnation of US-Japan negotiations on Shanghai. The US government must know that the real responsible parties for this matter are Britain and Japan, but the world's condemnation of the deterioration of this situation will inevitably be added to the United States. The answer to why Britain withdrew its small garrison from here is not difficult to find in the speech delivered by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, at the Anglo-Japanese Association in Tokyo on March 28 of this year. A few months before that, US Ambassador Grew had condemned Japan in clear terms, saying that the American public was deeply resentful of the actions of the Japanese army in China and the evils that damaged American interests in China. This statement, coupled with the American abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, has left little room for doubt about the basic policy of the United States.</p>
<p>British Policy Goes Against the Grain</p>
<p>Although there is no objective difficulty in cooperation between the US and Britain in policy on the Sino-Japanese War, and the destruction of British interests in China is even greater than that of the United States, Britain not only did not support the US ambassador's remarks, but British Ambassador Craigie even claimed: "Japan and Britain are both maritime powers on the edge of the Eurasian continent, and they have great concern for the situation on each of the continents. Although their methods may sometimes differ, the two countries are working towards the same ultimate goal, to achieve lasting peace and to protect our political system from external influences, so that the goals of the national policies of the two countries are not impossible to achieve in full harmony." The timing and trend of this speech all contain profound significance, and it has aroused criticism from public opinion in both Britain and the United States, so British Undersecretary Butler stated in a defense in the House of Commons on April 3 that the British attitude towards the legitimate government of China had not changed. However, in continuing to question the British policy, Butler openly defended Craigie's remarks in Tokyo and said that the British government did not oppose improving relations with Japan. Since Craigie's speech, various acts of compromise with Japan have followed one after another. Accepting Japanese conditions to resolve the Tianjin issue included ceding British concession police power to the Japanese, handing over a large amount of Tianjin silver to the Japanese, recognizing Japanese unsecured banknotes, and allowing them to circulate in the British concession. In Shanghai, as far as we know, the land bureau files of the Public Concession Municipal Council have been handed over to the Japanese. The decision was made to reopen the Burma Road. All of these things are comparable to Italy's "cutting France in the back with a sharp knife."</p>
<p>British Withdrawal of Troops Does Not Help</p>
<p>The recent withdrawal of this small defense force from Shanghai, which is only a thousand strong, cannot have any impact on the British-German war situation. We are unwilling to comment on the British gathering all their strength to engage in the European war, but any British compromise with Japan is unlikely to change the offensive taken by the Japanese warlords in the Far East. Moreover, there is no way to prevent Japan's increasingly open inclination towards the Axis powers. The current situation, in some respects, is very similar to Japan's secret obtaining of Allied consent in the last European war in order to seize Chinese territory at the end of the war.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Issue is Becoming Increasingly Urgent</p>
<p>The rapid progress of German forces in Europe has made the US policy in the Western Pacific increasingly difficult; because the crisis in Europe has made the Far Eastern issues that have been pending for ten years increasingly urgent. The Japanese aggression against China, which has been tolerated by Western democracies, has now spread to Southeast Asia. If Japan implements the Southern Advance, it will undoubtedly be at the same time as Germany and Italy launch a fierce offensive in Europe. So how can the United States effectively stop it? Especially if the US fleet may be redeployed to the Atlantic at that time. A few weeks ago, there were many differences in the US views on the Far Eastern issue. The Vandenberg faction advocated negotiating a new commercial treaty with Japan. He believed that if the United States did not have enough strength in the Far East to resist Japan, then it would be better to engage in a policy of reconciliation. The other, more dominant, faction is the faction of the current US Secretary of War Stimson, who advocates continuing to aid China, believing that this is the best defense for the United States against Japan in the Far East. At this time, intensifying aid to China, continuing to provide financial aid, and military equipment will surely be able to restrain Japan's reckless actions. The US restrictions on the export of defense program machinery and other military supplies also serve the same purpose.</p>
<p>Americans Advocate a Soviet-American Treaty</p>
<p>In addition, it is advocated that an agreement on the Far Eastern issue should be concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States in order to protect Chinese independence and the status quo in Southeast Asia. This major issue has become increasingly urgent due to the changes in the situation in Shanghai. On the other hand, the issue of US participation in the war has also become increasingly explicit recently. If it does become a reality, then the United States must demand that Britain and its powerful colonies cooperate with the United States to support the US policy in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Case on the Taiyuan Steamer; Concealing Gold Exposed; Large Batch of Canvas Cots Transported to Hong Kong; Gold Used as Hinges and Painted Green</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, inspectors from the River Customs Water Police seized a large batch of gold on the Taiyuan Steamer of Taikoo Company, intending to smuggle it out when the steamer left Shanghai yesterday. Initially, there was a large batch of canvas cots on the ship being transported to Hong Kong. Their structure was not like ordinary ones, and their hinge areas were painted green. The inspectors were driven by curiosity and tried to peel off the green paint, and what appeared before their eyes was the glittering gold. In total, the value of the gold hidden in this way is at least 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Route: Still No Vessel Prepared to Set Sail; Gao Deng's Sailing to Songmen Canceled</h3>
<p>Previously, there were rumors that funds from Shanghai to Fujian were obstructed, and a separate Fuzhou route was being considered. Inquiries to the shipping industry and customs declaration and transportation businesses reveal that no vessels are yet prepared to sail to Fuzhou. The German firm Lulun Yoko's Gao Deng vessel was scheduled to sail to Songmen, and also to Wan Nantian, Jinqing Port, Juexi, etc. It is now heard that there have been changes, and it is planned to sail to Ganpu on the 24th. Whether this will actually happen is to be decided today. The Lihe Yoko's Moufu vessel was forced to return to Shanghai from Gu'ao Tou. The cargo it carried has been continuously unloaded and stored in warehouses. The vessel originally intended to attempt another voyage to Gu'ao Tou, but due to fears of losses by cargo owners and passengers, they dared not load cargo onto it and abandoned the plan. The Yilong Company's Shenyou vessel sailed to Hongji yesterday to load coal.</p>
<p>Da Xin Sails to Wenzhou</p>
<p>The American Da Xin vessel has a load capacity of only about 100 tons. The vessel sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 18th and entered the Ou River on the 21st. Whether it was inspected by Japanese warships en route was not mentioned in the telegram from the ship owner in Wenzhou. After the successful trial voyage of Changde to Ao River, this vessel is the second to successfully sail to Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Baby Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Another foreign vessel, the Baby, with a load capacity of only about 100 tons, sailing from a certain place in Wenzhou to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. It was once docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, but later moved to the Astronomical Observatory Wharf to unload cargo. Its whereabouts yesterday were unknown. The vessel still plans to load cargo in Shanghai and go to Ou, but because customs has prohibited closing the declaration, it has been decided to sail to the Ao River instead. Procedures for closing the declaration are now underway, but the date of departure is not yet determined.</p>
<p>Xijiang Departure Date</p>
<p>The French postal vessel Xijiang (7,000 tons), which arrived in Shanghai from Kobe, Japan, on the morning of the day before yesterday at 6:00 AM, is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai on the 24th. Yesterday, there were rumors that the vessel was scheduled to depart yesterday, but the company stated that this was completely inaccurate. The vessel carried a large number of passengers and cargo on this trip to Shanghai, which cannot be unloaded in a short time. Whether it will depart on the 24th, or be delayed until the 25th due to unfinished unloading, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Shenhua's Demands</p>
<p>The Shenhua vessel, which sailed to Fujian this time, was robbed by pirates in Sanjiangkou Nanri Island. The Fujian Fellow Association decided to first send a letter to the vessel's company, stating briefly: "The association members unanimously believe that the situation of the robbery described by the disaster victims is vivid and true. The shipowner is not without considerable fault, and your company should immediately bear the responsibility. Upon further investigation, the disaster victims' money and belongings have been robbed, and they lack funds for food and lodging. Now that transportation is obstructed, it is unknown how long they will be stranded. Their situation is extremely pitiful. It has been decided that your company undertake the following four post-disaster measures: (1) Based on the amount of losses listed by the disaster victims, please compensate them in full. (2) The 78 people currently stranded in Shanghai who have registered with the association should be provided with food, lodging, and essential living expenses. (3) When navigation resumes in the future, they should be sent back to Fujian free of charge. (4) Those who have not yet registered with the association for assistance still retain their right to claim. A letter is hereby sent to you, hoping that your company will act with morality and provide the disaster victims with sufficient assistance to the best of your ability and reply promptly for processing."</p>
<h3>Safe Deposit Boxes: No Transfers Allowed; Subject to Lease Agreement; No Private Assignments</h3>
<p>The Bankers' Association issued a public notice yesterday, stating that it has been reported in newspapers that there are advertisements for the transfer of safe deposit boxes, which is inappropriate. Lessees enter into a lease agreement with the lessor when renting a safe deposit box, and are therefore subject to the terms of that agreement. They cannot transfer their rights and obligations to a third party based on their unilateral intentions. This type of private assignment is not effective against the lessor. Therefore, if a transfer is found, the lessor should terminate the contract with the original lessee and recover the original box. As for the transferee, since they have no lease relationship with the lessor, they naturally cannot be unauthorized occupants. Furthermore, private transfer of account names can easily lead to disputes and has significant implications for their own interests. A public notice is hereby issued, urging all sectors not to engage in such ventures rashly or undertake such transfers hastily. This notice.</p>
<h3>Luzon Ship Inbound and Outbound</h3>
<p>The U.S. Navy's shallow-water gunboat Luzon, stationed in Shanghai, was moored at the British Navy's pontoon in the Yangjingbang River. It departed on the 19th at approximately 11:00 AM and returned to Shanghai at approximately 4:00 PM. After hurrying back and forth, the vessel again weighed anchor and departed at approximately [time missing] yesterday morning, only to return to Shanghai and moor at its original location again at 5:15 PM in the afternoon. The repeated and hasty back and forth are puzzling.</p>
<h3>Japanese Search for Radio Equipment; One Employee Dies Suddenly</h3>
<p>The News Agency reported that the Japanese previously searched a certain building on Albert Road and Zhaofeng Road in the French Concession, together with the French police, and seized a large quantity of radio materials. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is reported that the radio materials seized from Albert Road were more numerous than those from Zhaofeng Road. On that day, 64 large trucks were used to transport the materials throughout the day, which were valued at approximately 3 million yuan at current prices. The materials from Albert Road were valued at approximately 1 million yuan, and a total of more than 30 trucks were used for transportation at that time. It is also reported that when the Japanese searched House No. 67 on Zhaofeng Road, where the materials were stored, an employee named Zhang was left behind in the house and was severely ill. Because he was unaware of the situation, he was greatly frightened, which exacerbated his illness, and he died the next day.</p>
<h3>Husband Commits Adultery with Sister-in-Law; Divorced Wife Seeks Damages; Jurisdiction in Question Pending Ruling</h3>
<p>Li Xiaoyun, a graduate of the Law and Politics University, is 32 years old and from Shanghai. On September 11, 1928, she married Rong Wenhao (36 years old), the owner of the Rong Wenji Construction Factory in Wuxi, through a matchmaker. The couple lived together on Rue Massenet in the French Concession, inside the Wenji Construction Factory, and their relationship was considered harmonious. Later, Rong fell for the beauty of Li's sister-in-law, Ying Yanxiu, resulting in</p>
<p>Marital Discord</p>
<p>After Rong and Ying were caught in the act by Li's biological brother, Yu Weixuan, the relationship between Li and Rong became strained. When Rong was caught in the act by Yu Weixuan, he wrote an IOU, willing to compensate Yu's losses by 10,000 yuan, with 8,000 yuan paid in advance. From then on, Rong cohabited with Ying. On May 10, 1932, Rong, to show that he still maintained a marital relationship with Li, commissioned lawyer Zhu Zhenlu to certify and deliver a written statement to Li, stating that in the future,</p>
<p>Should There Be Abandonment</p>
<p>etc., he would willingly pay Li 50,000 yuan in damages at once. On June 2 of that year, Rong suddenly gave Li a farewell letter, saying, "Your brother has harmed me. I have no face to return home and have gone out of the Wusong Estuary to join the waves. You don't need to look for me. Please take care of the affairs of the factory." After receiving the letter, Li inquired everywhere and learned that her husband had fled to Ningbo with his sister-in-law and was cohabiting. Rong also used the alias Rong Xinguang and served as the manager of the Lixing Tobacco Company in Ningbo. Li went to Ningbo and</p>
<p>Reported the Adultery to the Police</p>
<p>with records to prove it. Since then, the relationship between the couple has deteriorated even further. In 1938, Li filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court, claiming that Rong had no marital affection and requesting a divorce. The judgment has been finalized, dissolving the marital relationship between Li Xiaoyun and Rong Wenhao. Later, Rong reported Li for adultery. After investigation by the police, it was found that Rong no longer had the rights of a husband, and it was ruled that no prosecution would be made. Recently, Li again retained lawyer Xu Jianjie and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering Rong Wenhao to</p>
<p>Pay in Full</p>
<p>50,000 yuan in damages. The case was heard by Judge Mo in the Civil Court. The plaintiff, Li Xiaoyun, and her lawyer, Xu Jianjie, appeared in court to await questioning. The defendant, Rong Wenhao, commissioned lawyer Zhou Kun to appear in court and claim that the defendant lived in the pavilion at No. 4, Guanghua Lane, Rue Massenet, and that there were jurisdictional issues. Furthermore, the plaintiff had already cohabited with Yu Jianzhong, an employee of the Continental Bank at Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, at No. 18, Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road. The court reviewed the case and believed that it should be heard by the Second Special Court. The plaintiff's lawyer, Xu Jianjie, then requested that it be transferred to the Special Court. The court decided to await a ruling on the matter.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhang Kidnapped After Being Released; Arrested Again</h3>
<p>Gu Huanzhang, the owner of the Gongyi Leather Factory at the Jinsitu Temple on Connaught Road in Western Shanghai and the Gu Chunji Shoe Store on Daxin Street, was kidnapped by bandits some time ago and was later released from danger. Due to the inconvenience of living at home, he moved to No. 1, Yunle Village, Rue Edouard VII. His family members still lived at the original address. Not long after, Gu, feeling lonely, welcomed his mistress, Ding Yanqin, to live with him. Unexpectedly, at approximately 3:00 AM yesterday, the Chengdu Road Police Station dispatched Deputy Inspector Chen Yonggui, along with several Chinese and foreign detectives, to Gu's new residence and arrested Gu and Ding together, taking them to the police station. The investigation is still underway.</p>
<h3>Husband Has an Affair; Wife Seeks Divorce</h3>
<p>Xu Guanghua, a woman from Shaoxing, is 32 years old and lives at No. 12, Lane 646, Tiantong Road. She recently retained lawyer Qian Xingzhong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against her husband, Hu Qingzhi, seeking a divorce. The lawsuit states that she married Hu in Shaoxing in 1924, and it has been 16 years since then. They have two sons and two daughters. The relationship after marriage was considered harmonious. In 1934, Hu came to Shanghai to open the Xielong Tea Shop and used the excuse that his business was complicated and he had no time to return home. Until March of last year, when the flames of war spread to Shaoxing and it was impossible to live there, she brought her eldest son to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the defendant expressed dissatisfaction. In April of this year, she learned that the defendant had fallen in love with a woman from Jiangsu named Zhang Yuying, who was cohabiting with him at No. 6, Huian Lane, Avenue Edward VII, treating his wife of humble origin as discarded footwear. Repeated negotiations have been ineffective, making it impossible to live together for the rest of their lives. Therefore, she requests the court to grant a divorce to both parties. The court, based on the lawsuit, summoned both parties to mediation in Civil Court Four yesterday morning by Judge Shen Guqi. Because Hu did not appear in court, it was ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Husband Infected with Syphilis; Wife Infected; Woman Files Charge of Injury</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court Eight of the First Special District Court heard a case in which a woman accused her husband of violating Article 285 of the Criminal Code (i.e., knowingly having venereal disease and engaging in indecent acts or adultery with others, resulting in infection). Cases of this kind have never been seen before, and the following is a record:</p>
<p>Suzhou Woman</p>
<p>Lu Yuezhen, 22 years old, has been a silk weaver at the Meyer Silk Weaving Factory. She married Yin Jianhua, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker. Yin is 26 years old and works as a tea server at the Continental Hotel on Rue du President Foch. They were formally married on May 30 of this year at the Dafugui Restaurant on Rue de Vilmont in the French Concession and cohabited at No. 79, Rue Massenet, Madrid. Recently, Lu Yuezhen accused her husband of having syphilis, which he transmitted to his wife, and recently,</p>
<p>The Poison Has Erupted</p>
<p>Making it difficult to sit or lie down, causing great pain. She repeatedly asked her husband to seek medical treatment, but was repeatedly refused. Under such circumstances, it is equivalent to breaking off all ties of affection and righteousness. Out of resentment, she reported the matter to the Old Zha Police Station on the 14th of this month. After an investigation by Sergeant Fang Teer and Officer Hua San Dao Tou No. 1013 of the Floral Tax Squad, and after sending Lu to the Renji Hospital for examination, they filed a lawsuit against Yin Jianhua according to the law.</p>
<p>Summons Issued</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Ke took the stand in Criminal Court Eight to summon the defendant. The defendant retained lawyer Hu Yongsheng to defend him. According to the statement of lawyer Peng Qiqi of the police station, the above situation was presented. Because the examination procedures in this case were not complete and the defendant should also be examined, a postponement was requested. According to Lu Yuezhen's testimony, after marrying the defendant through a matchmaker, she discovered scars on the defendant's hands that night, and there were ulcerated marks on his buttocks and legs. When she questioned him, he claimed that he had been injured by shards of porcelain when he was young. At that time, because she did not know about syphilis, she was kept in the dark for half a month. Suddenly, she felt</p>
<p>Pain in Her Lower Body</p>
<p>The redness and swelling increased daily. She returned to Ningbo to tell her mother, who diagnosed it as syphilis. Recently, the disease has erupted severely, making it impossible to sit during the day and sleep at night. The pain is difficult to describe. Her tears flowed and she looked extremely miserable. When questioned, the defendant Yin Jianhua stated that he did indeed suffer from syphilis in Suzhou two years ago, but it had already been cured by a doctor. The case was postponed for seven days, and the defendant was ordered to go to Renji Hospital for verification and further review.</p>
<h3>Yu Changsheng Recounts the Pain of Renting a House</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the large number of people and the shortage of houses in Shanghai, various disputes have constantly arisen between landlords and tenants. Now, a man named Yu Changsheng, having personally experienced this kind of pain, specifically wrote to the Chinese Taxpayers Association to express his feelings. The summary of the letter is recorded below for the research of those who are concerned about the housing problem. The letter briefly states that Yu Changsheng rented a house at No. 1238, Dingjun Lane, Avenue Edward VII, in 1937, with a monthly rent of 120 yuan and water fees paid by the landlord. In December 1938, the owner transferred the house to a certain bank for management. Soon, the bank sent a letter ordering him to move out. As a result, under the conditions of "increasing the rent by 5 yuan and Yu Changsheng bearing all water fees," a lease agreement was signed for a period of six months. In late April 1939, the bank sent a letter in advance, instructing him to move out when the lease expired. He had to beg them again, and they proposed the condition of "increasing the rent by 15 yuan starting from May 1939" and renewing the lease agreement for a period of one year. In October 1939, the bank suddenly sent a letter again requesting an increase in the rent of 10 yuan. When he questioned them, "The lease has not yet expired, why are you increasing the rent in the middle of the term?" They replied, "If you do not agree to increase the rent in the middle of the term, we will definitely not renew the lease after the lease expires." As a result, he yielded to their demands again and annotated the original lease agreement, stating that the rent would be increased by 10 yuan starting from October 1939. Unexpectedly, in March 1940, the bank sent a letter again, stating that the lease term was about to expire and instructing him to move out in advance. In early April 1940, the bank and a certain company sent letters at the same time, notifying him that the house would be transferred to the company for management starting from April 1940. Soon, they collected the rent for April and May 1940. In early June 1940, he received a civil summons from the First Special District Court, and he learned that they had filed a lawsuit in court to evict him from the house. After three court hearings, on August 6, 1940, it was ruled that Yu Changsheng should move out of the house within five months from the date of delivery of the judgment, and Yu Changsheng should compensate for the losses calculated at 5 yuan per day from June 1, 1940, to August 1, 1940. The application for provisional execution by Taylor Company was rejected. The litigation costs for the provisional execution part were to be borne by the plaintiff, and the remaining part was to be borne by Yu Changsheng. In summary, he has suffered all kinds of oppression in the past three years. What injustice in the world is greater than this?</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of the Calligraphers' and Painters' Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Hunan Provincial Government Orders Counties to Complete School Coverage in Stages to Lay the Foundation for National Education</h3>
<p>(Laiyang Correspondent) The Hunan Provincial Department of Education considers one school per bao (administrative unit) to be the first step in popularizing national education. After receiving Chairman Xue's hand-written instructions to complete the task within a time limit, they immediately ordered all counties to conduct a thorough investigation of the number of schools in each county and the number of bao with and without schools. At the same time, they formulated measures for counties to establish schools. The provincial government issued an order to all counties to establish schools in the bao without schools, following the measures. Most counties have already submitted their investigation and planning for establishing schools. Except for ten counties, including Xiangtan, Changde, and Hengshan, which have already completed one school per bao, and Yueyang and Linxiang, which need to determine the completion date based on the progress of the war, the remaining thirteen counties, including Changsha, Linli, and Chenxian, are required to complete the task by the end of this year; ten counties, including Pingjiang, Hengyang, and Xupu, are required to complete the task by the end of June next year; sixteen counties, including Laiyang, Yiyang, and Cili, are required to complete the task by the end of December next year; five counties, including Shaoyang, Yongshun, and Huarong, are required to complete the task by the end of June in 1942; and nineteen counties, including Qiyang, Xiangyin, and Yuanling, are required to complete the task by the end of 1942. However, since the reorganization of the baojia (administrative and security system) in Hunan Province, the area of each bao has been expanded compared to before. The area of one bao often reaches more than ten li in length and width. If only one elementary school is established in one bao, it would be inconvenient for children to attend school and difficult to accommodate all school-age children. Therefore, in order to popularize national education, one school per bao is still insufficient. In the future, it is planned to increase the number of schools in each bao to more than one, to lay the initial foundation for national education.</p>

<h3>Paramount Demonstrates Righteousness and Courage: Accepts Charity Challenge; Other Basketball Teams Should Follow Suit and Ensure the Success of This Great Match</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the charity basketball challenge, all parties have unanimously expressed their approval. It can be used to determine the basketball hegemony of Shanghai, and at the same time, it can provide a huge subsidy for charity. Now, the Paramount Athletic Association has demonstrated righteousness and courage and has expressed its acceptance of the challenge, ready to fight. It is hoped that other teams will not lag behind in doing good and will express their willingness to make this great match a success. The Paramount's letter is recorded below: To the editor, Dear Sir: In the letters publicly published in your newspaper by Zhang Hongsheng and Sun Qihuang, it was suggested that the Shanghai All-Stars and our association have another round to obtain a larger amount of charity income. We are deeply grateful and ashamed to have been praised for our humble talents. Our association aims to promote sports. Since Zhang and Sun have taken the lead in criticizing us, and the advanced members of the press have urged us, we dare not refuse the matter of charity. We will discuss the suggestions with all members of our association, and they all agree. If the advanced members of the Shanghai basketball community bestow their guidance, we will gain a lot from the experience of others in improving our skills. Our association will certainly hold the whip and the reins, and retreat three houses to compete with the talented players in the arena. As for how to stipulate and where to fight, we will leave it to the press to propose and plan. Our association dare not say anything more. Sincerely, we ask you to publish this humble request in a corner of your newspaper to encourage others to do the same. We sincerely wish you good health.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market, the British and American exchange rates initially loosened but then tightened, with no clear winner. It was rumored that Hong Kong traders were entering the market, and the market trend was already on the verge of stabilizing due to the absorption by British businesses. Moreover, the rumors shifted from negative to positive, leading importers to settle accounts and speculators to buy. Initially, the New York pound had returned to the official rate. Both exchanges opened flat in the morning. Chinese businesses were the first to sell, and American banks showed willingness to supply. The U.S. dollar was the only currency to be extended. It briefly turned flat due to HSBC's absorption and reduced buying by importers. Around noon, rumors of profit-taking spread, and speculators resumed selling. The U.S. dollar for this month was expected to strengthen to $5.71875, and the British pound followed suit, depreciating to 3 shillings 7.1875 pence for settlement. In the afternoon, HSBC continued to absorb, and news from Hong Kong was alarming. It was also rumored that there were military actions in French Indochina and Japan, and that Hong Kong was strictly prohibiting the outflow of funds. Speculators also turned to buying, instantly returning the previous loosening trend to flat. The British pound ultimately closed at 3 shillings 7.03125 pence, and the U.S. dollar at $5.59375, settling flat. Trading was quite active throughout the day.</p>

Subsequently, foreign firms also came to buy, and the underlying trend stabilized. It was estimated that foreign firms had bought current U.S. dollars from American banks at $5.65625.

<h3>Gold Market Fluctuates After Falling, Driven by Rumors</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial gold market saw a rebound after an initial drop, which was encouraging. Initially, the exchange market loosened, and sellers flocked to the market. The opening price was 5,660 yuan, which immediately fell to 5,645 yuan. Banks were mostly selling. Subsequently, with the buying by Qian Dui Ye and the securities firms, the price rose to 5,680 yuan. However, it ultimately fell again to 5,620 yuan due to continued selling by both gold and silver firms. At noon, Qian Dui Ye resumed buying, reaching 5,638 yuan. The initial outlook for the afternoon was still weak, with the lowest price approaching the 5,600 yuan level. Subsequently, news of conflict between French and Japanese forces in Vietnam and various other positive rumors emerged, and the market began to tighten. A considerable buying spree suddenly arose. Banks covered their short positions, and retail investors also bought, pushing the price as high as 5,705 yuan. The evening close was only 5,695 yuan, a small increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was quiet and bustling at times throughout the day, with a volume of approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged, and customs gold prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Unofficial Gold Drops Only Ten Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening was pressed down by a small 40 yuan due to the looser exchange rate. Gold firms sold 20 taels to Qian Dui Ye at 5,660 yuan. Subsequently, due to competitive selling by gold and silver firms, it continued to fall by 15 yuan. Banks sold 20 taels to securities firms, dropping to 5,645 yuan. After that, a certain Qian Dui Ye and securities firms absorbed, and the market trend temporarily stabilized. Qian Dui Ye bought 30 taels from banks, rising to 5,680 yuan. However, as the exchange rate continued to strengthen, floating shorts seized the opportunity to increase their positions. Gold and silver firms competed to sell again, and it soon fell to 5,650 yuan. At this time, many retail investors also sold off in pain at the sight of the decline, and the selling trend expanded, falling sharply by 30 yuan. Gold firms sold 30 taels to securities firms at a low price of 5,620 yuan. At noon, Qian Dui Ye and securities firms saw the low price and came to buy aggressively again, and sellers decreased. The price had recovered by more than 20 yuan before the close, but the closing price was only 5,638 yuan due to the bank's selling. The afternoon initially opened weak, with the opening price pressed down by 28 yuan. Banks sold 20 taels to gold firms at 5,610 yuan. It then fell another 5 yuan, reaching 5,605 yuan. After the low, the securities firms absorbed, and the market trend slightly turned, immediately rising by 20 yuan. Soon, a certain bank suddenly came to aggressively cover short positions, rising by another 10 yuan. At that time, news of the conflict between French and Japanese forces in Vietnam suddenly spread, and the exchange market tightened, immediately causing considerable selling. Another bank also came to cover short positions. Although Qian Dui Ye longs sold in between, the price rose to 5,670 yuan. The buying momentum then subsided slightly, and the price fell back by more than 10 yuan, but ultimately, due to the tightening exchange rate, securities firm longs increased their positions. Before the close, they broke through the 5,700 yuan mark. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from banks, rising to 5,705 yuan, but the closing price slightly recovered to 5,695 yuan. As a result, it only fell 5 yuan compared to the 10th. The entire day fluctuated by 100 yuan.

<h3>British Gold Notes See Sharp Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the unofficial gold fall and then rise again, so the U.S. dollar and pound each fell by 1.5 yuan before rising again in the afternoon. British gold notes were flat in the morning, but rumors swirled in the afternoon, and supply from various parties suddenly surged, causing the market price to fall sharply. U.S. dollar notes temporarily retreated to 17.58 yuan in the morning due to mixed news, but suddenly rose to 17.83 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of one angle compared to the previous day's settlement. The demand for Hong Kong notes gradually decreased, and the market price softened slightly. Both Japanese and Korean gold notes experienced frequent price increases due to the scarcity of circulation, but the demand from various parties was quite high. The former rose to 1.45 yuan, and the latter rose to 1.08 yuan.</p>
<h3>Identification of Silk and Cotton Fabrics</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of buying clothing materials is how to identify the quality of the material, because the quality of the material determines the effectiveness. Based on the author's service experience, the simple methods for identifying silk and cotton fabrics are written below.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics are light and thin, and whether the warp and weft organization is tight or not cannot be concealed, so it can be seen at a glance. However, the same type of silk can vary greatly in weight, and the price difference between heavy and light is significant, so there is inevitably a disadvantage of buying inferior goods at the price of good goods. Therefore, we must distinguish between them. Heavier silk is considered a top grade if the silk surface is smooth and shiny without any roughness. Lighter silk is considered the best if the silk surface is uniform, clean, and elegant without any traces of parallel silk splitting. For those that are mixed with sizing glue and heavy, the loose powder will fall off by hand. For those that are light, taste it with your tongue; it will feel sweet and greasy, and the licked area will not immediately soak through. As for whether the raw material is rayon or natural silk, a small amount of its warp and weft can be extracted and burned separately with fire. If it smells bad and has ash that clumps together, it is real silk. If it turns to ashes immediately upon contact with fire and scatters without any residue, it is rayon. This is the difference between fatty substances and fibrous substances.</p>
<p>As for cotton fabrics, it seems more difficult to identify them than silk fabrics. When heavily sized and thin fabrics are viewed in sunlight, it can be observed that the fabric eyes are completely covered by sizing glue between the warp and weft, and the fabric surface is relatively hard. Hold one end of the fabric and pull its horizontal side first, then pull its vertical side. If it returns to its original shape after being pulled, the fabric body is strong. If it is skewed to the left and right after being pulled and the length is uneven, the fabric body is loose and inferior. For dyed fabrics, rub the fabric surface back and forth with a white handkerchief. If the handkerchief is colored and the fabric surface has a halo, the fabric is heavily sized, and the color is also very easy to fall off. If the thread head is frizzy and easily broken when the warp and weft threads are pulled apart, the fabric is inferior. If the thread head is smooth and strong, the fabric is good. There is also a type of linen fabric that is brittle and thin and can also be used as cotton fabric. This can be felt by hand on the fabric surface. If it feels smooth and firm, it is linen. After being crumpled, the wrinkles are also more numerous and have the appearance of folding and cracking. This is what buyers must pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Slightly Lower, Foreign Stocks Active</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market surprisingly rebounded slightly yesterday, without any signs of a sharp drop. This was only because the number of floating longs was relatively congested, causing them to close their positions, which had pressed down by two or three angles. Moreover, since it had risen for many days without any official positive news, a slight pullback was a necessary path. With steadfast sentiment and insufficient chips, the slightest pullback triggered short covering, and the underlying foundation remained stable. However, the market may now become stable as both longs gradually feel satisfied and shorts are unwilling to cover at high prices, and is awaiting changes in the environment. In the morning, Lianhe and Heng Kang initially bought and strengthened, then Hongda Tong Kang Hong Kang and others sold and weakened, and then Le Mao Jiu Feng and others bought and recovered slightly. In the afternoon, Lianhe Jiu Feng continued to buy, and Tong Kang also switched from selling to buying, but Yi Chang Hongda Lianyi Shun Tai and others continued to sell heavily, so it still could not rise. As a result, it fell slightly by five minutes to one and a half angles, with a transaction volume of approximately 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of Jiating Gongye She stock were traded at a price of 79 yuan each.</p>
<p>The volume of trading in public shares yesterday was rare in recent months. The speed of rubber stocks' rise was unparalleled. It can be seen that general investors had been steadily accumulating before the market was quiet for no reason. Industrial stocks were not abandoned, and many also had amazing rising trends. Generally speaking, it was slightly less vigorous than the rubber stocks. The trend of profit-taking and the rapid rise came side by side, creating an interesting contrast. Yesterday's strong and high market was certainly due to various rumors, rather than containing definite and reasonable facts.</p>
<p>London, 21st Wednesday - Today's listed market for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks are all calm, and there are no changes in prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Distant Futures Yarn, Large Players Still Hedging</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly, and the trend gradually showed an upward pattern. However, actual sales were not as strong as the previous day. However, the general speculative sentiment was tightened. This is because market rumors said that Shenxin No. 9 Factory would temporarily suspend the sale of Shuangma Zhan orders starting in September (the content of this matter is unknown, and speculators may have played a role, or it may be unknowable). Therefore, the chips on the table felt dry. However, the price of September Bianma in the distant future was cheaper than the spot price, starting at 905 yuan, and later reaching 917 yuan. Large players had the intention of hedging.</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market was still peaceful in the morning, and the shouting was stable. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 915 yuan. However, after this offer was opened, scalpers waited and watched, and then slightly rose to 19 yuan. At this time, there was a slight sale, and the situation was not tight. Unexpectedly, Daye Company collected at a price limit of 917 yuan, and so-and-so also came to pull in, so everyone rushed to 929 yuan, with a smart momentum and lively shouts. Unexpectedly, a large Cantonese player suddenly came to sell more than a hundred, and the price plummeted to 921 yuan. The closing was slightly better by one or two yuan, at 923 yuan. The statistics for the half-day transaction were 1,405 packages. The market for 20-count Shuangma rose 5.5 yuan. It was also found that 30 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Haikou today, and 370 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed separately below.</p>

<h3>Although Factory Purchases are Quiet, Cotton Merchants Still Waiting for Good Sales</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading has improved slightly. Although the Japanese factory's purchases are not large and smooth, sporadic purchases continue. However, in the current environment, selling prices are still difficult to increase greatly. The general situation has not changed much. Because the yarn market does not rise, and the selling price of Japanese yarn is even cheaper, although the sales of Chinese yarn continue to be non-stop, with the interruption of shipping and the new cotton crop having entered a good stage, the cotton market is still neither alive nor dead at this time when new flowers are gradually appearing.</p>
<p>Another message is that the market price of foreign cotton and New York cotton market is extremely firm. First because of speculation buying, and then because of Wall Street stock prices and buying a part of the banking sector in the city, the results closed higher than the previous day up four or five pounds, and the Indian also connected yesterday predicted rose a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been quiet, and there are no purchases. As there are not many ships on the market every day, inventory is also sparse, so trade is done among peers with the intention to sell.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Sentiment Softens</h3>
<p>Since the sales of soybeans have turned sluggish, the market sentiment has been hovering in an ordinary situation. As for the source of supply, it is also lively in the situation of high prices attracting distant goods, so although the underlying trend is not exciting, it is softening. Yesterday's opening saw 200 packages of new cowhide yellow beans from Changzhou in the second batch arrive, with a total of two cars arriving. Because the goods were worse than the first batch, the price was only 33 yuan. Other transactions included 600 packages of Anqing beans at prices ranging from 21 yuan to 31.4 yuan, over 100 packages of Wuhu beans at a price of 11.4 yuan, 34 packages of Chongming beans at a price of 20.04 yuan, 50 packages of Pu Jian She beans at a price of 31 yuan, 50 packages of Chongming sand yellow beans at a price of 28 yuan, and 300 packages of Hankou Zha beans at a price of 28.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Today there are also 750 bags of beans and 46 pieces of bean oil transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice Remains Expensive</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market sentiment remained lively after the opening this morning. Although there were no large-scale transactions from mainland merchants, sporadic consumption gradually became active, and cooperatives inquired about prices. Southern merchants and rural merchants also took advantage of the flat prices to absorb supplies. The owners of goods mostly held on to them because the production prices were difficult to calculate, and the general floating accumulation was also actively taking advantage of the opportunity. By the middle of the market, each price had risen by more than one yuan, and the release gradually increased from this point. As a result, the number of releases was more than the number of advances, and the fatigue gradually returned. The closing price was slightly more than 5-6 corners compared to the market front. The first number, Chen Saigon was 59 yuan, a new 57.6 yuan, two numbers were 54 yuan, 53.5 yuan. The first number, Siam was 58.5 yuan, fire screw was 58.2 yuan, 57.4 yuan, and Hong Kong Sharp was 57.5 yuan, 56 yuan. The recycled raw packs rose 0.5 to 1 yuan. The Ningbo gang came back to give 300 tons of Saigon rice, the price opened at 55 yuan. Mixed broken tons were also made on the market for 75 tons, and the price was 51.5-52.5 yuan. Two Siam Saigon tons was 150 tons, the price was 62.5-63 yuan, and two Siam tons was 50 tons, the price was 63 yuan, which all came from customer hoarding. Now the rice has a transaction of 14,000 packs, which mainly focuses on customers hoarded. There is also a lack of stomach ease of selling the standing installations in this street.</p>
<p>Jingnuo Guomi, arrived continued, resulting in clear prices of between the dark and the tight sea rice, the rumors suddenly also extremely lively, and selling prices in the proprietor reversed under the condition of being up from a half to seven different points. Normal Fresh, clear six eighty yuan, super Jing six sixty-seven yuan, Wuxi Jing six sixty-four yuan, sixty-six yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Jing top prices from six sixty-five per cent of the number to the nights sixth eleven yuan, and Inn early rice packages six sixty-three and a half yuan, sixty-two and a half yuan. Newly released fresh sixty-two cents, sixty-two and a half yuan, and normal about sixty yuan. The top prices from sixty-two cents, sixty-two and a half yuan to the night fifty-eight cents, and seven corners, and glutinous rice Jin Li specific goods sixty-eight yuan, often Dan goods six sixty-five ninety yuan, and Hong Kong specific yuan sixty-one to two yuan and common five ninety yuan or sixty yuan P yuan fifty-four to five yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's fresh round was scarce. It was twenty-eight to see how. The marketing sales of the land and goods were strong. In a blink it was sold out. As such, the market was especially tight, and it suddenly opened with special prices of sixty-three yuan, and middle was sixty-two yuan.</p>
<h3>Supply Increases Gradually; Flour Market Continues to Be Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour was loose, and the Chinese flour mill had not changed its prices. The Fuxin Factory has continued to supply, and the Japanese Feng Huang brand has again opened its full vehicles, so the supply is gradually increasing. The sentiment of the people is now that the transport of the south and north trade may be restricted or opened, and the new trade is still difficult to develope. On yesterday's markets Green phoenix was selling for 14.2 yuan in August, and at half, from fourteen yuan in september and seven cents. In September it was selling for 14.6 yuan to 6 cents, which is less than two cents higher than the day. The numbers of factory transactions and daily powder have both got around One two hundred packs, however, the ocean power is trade. Only inner mainland has Jinshan and points.</p>
<p>The market for small wheat, yesterday, the rise and fall are both difficult to do. After checking up on the market, there is no special profit. In order to meet the Japanese factory to be bought for money and is always going to make a deal to buy. Yesterday the trade of Chinese and not up to what factory was wanting, however, the cost should be taken into consideration and the price is also the same.</p>

For example, the top grade of Shai Zhuang has now reached 200 yuan in the market, an increase of 30 yuan compared to before. However, the demand for small and medium-sized grains is weaker and more stable.</p>

<h3>Abridged Biography of Hao Yi</h3>
<p>Hao Yi, with utmost sincerity, was a native of Xiangfu, Henan. At the age of fourteen, he served under a certain official in charge of river works. When the official was convicted of a crime, Hao requested to take his place. The official refused, so Hao turned himself in. The superior official took pity on him and lightly sentenced him to exile in the Wu region. At that time, General Wei Zhenjun Renzhai was stationed in Wu. Hao, bearing his sentence, followed Renzhai. He was known for his loyalty and bravery and was awarded the rank of Sixth Grade with a cap button. When Renzhai died of illness and was laid to rest in Pu, Hao was consumed by grief as if he had lost his heaven. He consumed poison in the mortuary. The crowd went to see, lamenting and weeping! Wu Junmen, Xiaoxuan, recognized his righteousness and ordered a generous burial together with Renzhai. Hao's parents died early, and he had no wife or children. Yet, he dedicated himself entirely to serving his master. Was he a knight-errant or what the ancients called a man of righteousness? Wu Junmen reported his deeds to the court, and the generals in command of the troops all wished to spread his story widely to inspire the world. This newspaper reported the beginning and end of his story as such.</p>
<p>Ground Fissures Reveal Gold</p>
<p>In Surigao, a territory belonging to Little Luzon, an earthquake occurred last month. High banks became valleys, and deep valleys became hills. Passersby lamented! After things settled down, someone followed the traces of the changes and suddenly saw scattered yellow dots in the cracked pit, reflecting like stars. They were gold nuggets. The residents fought to pan and dig them. The matter was reported to the officials, who took the nuggets and gave them to chemists to refine. They all said it was high-quality red gold. Officials were immediately appointed to manage and recruit people for mining. It is currently heard that a considerable amount of gold is being produced daily. Commentators say that Little Luzon may have signs of becoming a wealthy country.</p>

<h3>The Diet Problem of Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>— Yu Ren</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the difficult lives of elementary school teachers. Eight or nine out of ten of them earn less than forty yuan a month. On an isolated island where prices are so high, having a room and a family is difficult to dream of. Clothes can be a little torn, sleep can be as and where one finds it, and walking can be done on foot, but the reality of a full belly for three meals a day is simply impossible to solve. "How exactly do they fill their stomachs?" I only learned a rough idea of ​​this question recently when I ran into several old classmates:</p>
<p>(1) Teachers form their own food company – This method can only be done in larger schools. There must be at least two or three tables of people eating to hire a cook and start their own meals. Eating porridge and rice is decided by everyone after discussion, and it still looks like "individual" eating. At the end of the month, the average cost per person is about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Principal provides meals – This is only possible if the principal lives on campus or near the school. Some kind principals and their wives are often able to understand the teachers' situation, and the quality of the meals they provide to the teachers is better and the cost is lower. However, some calculating principals and their wives often add part or all of their family's meal expenses to the teachers, increasing the teachers' burden.</p>
<p>(3) School provides meals – Eight or nine out of ten schools only provide lunch, which is usually very bad. Because schools that provide lunch usually do not provide accommodation, teachers in this situation also suffer a lot.</p>
<p>(4) Eating pre-made meals – Cold rice, cold dishes, and cold soup are common causes of stomachaches, and the cost is not low.</p>
<p>(5) Eating as a guest – Eating at the homes of relatives and friends. However, the travel time is time-consuming, and the time is often not accurate, so there are inevitably unspeakable hardships.</p>
<p>(6) Eating at restaurants – In the alleys, there are rarely any lower-class restaurants, so teachers often go to eat lunch. But because the houses are small and there are many customers, waiting an hour is extremely common. Recently, after the price increased from 40 cents to 50 cents, the 15 yuan for lunch each month, plus breakfast and dinner, is even more considerable.</p>
<p>(7) DIY – One or two colleagues get together to buy rice and vegetables and cook their own meals. Because there are few people, the expenses are often very high, and cooking a meal takes a lot of time, so there is no time to grade papers during the day.</p>
<p>(8) Buying rice, porridge, and ready-made dishes – Teachers who don't know how to cook often ask the school workers to buy food for them to eat in order to save money. This way of eating is the most unhygienic, and it does not save money.</p>
<p>(9) Irregular eating – Some teachers have tried eating pre-made meals, eating at restaurants, and cooking their own meals, but after encountering difficulties, they have adopted an extreme method. If they have money, they eat at restaurants; if they don't have money, they go to food stalls or eat white porridge, buns, and fried dough sticks for several days in a row. Their lives are completely unregulated and truly pitiful.</p>
<p>In summary, for the thousands upon thousands of elementary school teachers on the isolated island, their dietary problems have not been reasonably solved except for the first and second methods mentioned above. However, they bear the heavy responsibility of educating the future masters of the country. Here, the author sincerely hopes that schools, after increasing tuition fees, will also consider increasing teachers' salaries as much as possible.</p>
<h3>"The Tiger's Mouth"</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM, I went out because of something. I hadn't gone far from my house when I saw a crowd of people. There must be something interesting to watch. Driven by curiosity, I squeezed into the crowd to take a look. But it would have been better if I hadn't seen it, as the sight made me terrified. A woman in her forties was run over by a public bus, and her brains were all over the ground. It was a terrible sight.</p>
<p>It was said that the deceased was a maid waiting for employment in a talent agency near the bus station. She was arguing with the agency's staff member who was sending a maid to work over a Ningbo fan. They were chasing and playing in the middle of the road, unaware that disaster was approaching.</p>
<p>I recalled that several days ago, two children and an old woman had been run over and killed near this road. The reasons were nothing more than the large number of people coming and going to buy groceries in the morning and the insufficient lighting at night, which made it easy for accidents to happen. The most hateful thing is that the barbers in the barbershop who are free like to flirt and quarrel with the maids, chasing back and forth in the middle of the road. This not only makes it easy for the children they are supposed to be taking care of to have accidents, but also often causes pedestrians to be bumped into.</p>

<p>I nodded and said, "Of course, the time and clothes are solid evidence. Was he injured on the cheek?"</p>
<p>"Probably so, the people in the hotel aren't very clear."</p>
<p>"What did you do after that?"</p>
<p>"I knew that Mr. Hawthorne could go out on his own, so I thought he might have returned already. I called here to ask, but Shi Gui replied that he hadn't returned. I also thought he might have gone to a nearby hospital, so I ran to four hospitals in a row, but there was no result. I don't know where he went, and I'm very worried."</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and said, "Judging from the situation, he's not only not in danger, but even his injuries must not be very serious. You don't need to worry, worrying is useless."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "I always feel sorry for him... So, where did he go?"</p>
<p>"I think we'll get news from him soon."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou pondered for a moment and then said, "Mr. Bao, who do you think hit him? Could it be Yu Gantang?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But if it's Yu Gantang himself, I can guarantee it's not him." I briefly told him about my experience of following Yu Gantang, from catching up to the elevator to Changming Lane.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's face changed a little. He was no longer as anxious and frustrated as when he first came in. He cheered up and said, "It's good news that this Yu Gantang has been located. This person is indeed highly suspected of involvement in Wang Lilan's matter. The person who hit Mr. Hawthorne just now may have been his accomplice."</p>
<p>He also told me about his investigation at Jiangnan University. According to a student surnamed Liu in the same dormitory, Yu Gantang didn't return to the dormitory until about 12:30 last night. After returning, he went out again. He also tossed and turned at night, as if he hadn't slept well. He rushed out again early in the morning, and no one knew his whereabouts. Combined with what I saw and heard, his suspicion is indeed very strong. After we talked for a while, Ni Jinshou expressed his conclusion.</p>
<p>He said, "Since Mr. Hawthorne doesn't seem to be in danger and we have nowhere to find him, we might as well arrest this man named Yu first."</p>
<p>I nodded and said, "Okay, I can accompany you. I think he's still at No. 3, Alley 1, Changming Lane, Changming Road - wait, I need to go upstairs to get something." (84)</p>
<h3>Selling Books</h3>
<p>— Fan Qi</p>
<p>A Nan quickly wrapped a bundle of books.</p>
<p>His heart seemed to feel a wave of sentimental emotion, feeling truly degraded beyond recognition, that even these books, usually treasured like life itself, had to be sent to the used bookstore.</p>
<p>As he hurried out of the dormitory with this large bundle of books, the landlady happened to be standing at the door, looking somewhat surprised. She sized A Nan up and down. He quickly lowered his head, not greeting her, and rushed past.</p>
<p>Walking onto the street, the scorching autumn heat threatened A Nan, but he only cared about carrying the books and walking silently. The street was filled with people, struggling and clamoring with each other. Trams, cars, and rickshaws sped by, but it seemed that he had no feelings about any of it. Walking to the entrance of a used bookstore, he saw the sign for buying used books in the dim light. He was about to go in, but immediately backed out again. He felt that going into a used bookstore to sell books was a shameful and degrading act. He pulled his hat down and still hesitated at the door of the bookstore, not daring to go in.</p>
<p>"I didn't steal someone else's books to sell. This is a legitimate and aboveboard act. What's there to be ashamed of? Go in! To solve your own living problems, you have to do this. Pluck up the courage and go in!" A Nan pulled his hat down a little lower and finally walked in.</p>
<p>"Sir, what books do you want to buy?"</p>
<p>"No, I have some used books. Please take a look and see if you want them?" A Nan reluctantly managed to say a few words.</p>
<p>"How much do you want?" A clerk walked over, flipped through a few books, gave him a contemptuous look, and lazily asked.</p>
<p>"You say!"</p>
<p>"No, it's your stuff. You should say the price yourself."</p>
<p>"Five dollars!" Seeing the guy's contemptuous and disdainful attitude, A Nan didn't dare to ask for more.</p>
<p>"Don't want them." The clerk said bluntly.</p>
<p>"How much do you think they're worth?"</p>
<p>"One dollar!"</p>
<p>A Nan was so shocked that he almost jumped up, wanting to slap the clerk across the face a couple of times. Books that originally cost eighteen or nineteen dollars were only worth one dollar. This was a joke. He probably thought these books were stolen from someone else. Even if I'm poor now, I can't have such a cheap sale. I put in a lot of effort to get them when I bought them.</p>
<p>"Then make it three dollars!" But his stomach was pressing him again, and A Nan had to give in again.</p>
<p>"Don't want them!" The clerk turned and walked away with an indifferent air.</p>
<p>A Nan angrily left the bookstore, feeling extremely humiliated. A ball of angry fire was burning fiercely in his heart. "A used bookstore is originally a place to exploit poor students!"</p>

<h3>A Contribution to the World of Comedy</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>I remember when "August 13th" first happened, I was working in my hometown. Transportation was blocked, and newspapers could not be delivered. Therefore, I listened to the radio for news every day. Besides the慷慨激昂rousing and exciting reports, what I found most touching was the loud appeal of the comedic world. They expressed it in humorous and lively words. Even hundreds of miles away, it was as if I was on the front lines, witnessing the heroic posture of the soldiers, the plaintive cries of the wounded. My heart was filled with righteous indignation, and I could not control myself.</p>
<p>Originally, comedy seemed to be derived from the clown in Peking opera. On one hand foolish, on the other hand wise, with wisdom in foolishness, and foolishness in wisdom. They speak off the cuff, and it naturally becomes wonderful. Looking at old books, there is such a record: "The clown is the name of a dramatic character, with painted faces and slapstick, commonly called a small painted face. There are also those who wear ordinary clothes and only move people with their voices, expressions, and laughter, which is another style." This so-called "another style" is naturally like today's comedy—a one-man show. From this, it can be seen that comedy is also derived from the officials in the court who made sarcastic and clever remarks, and their mission is naturally to criticize worldly customs, not just to make people laugh.</p>
<p>However, comedy today has obviously gradually declined. In the article "A Respectful Message to the World of Comedy" by Jingcheng Jun, published in this column a few days ago, it was said that "People who like to listen are gradually abandoning it out of disgust," and even "It makes listeners feel a headache." Therefore, Jingcheng Jun hopes that the comedy world should "try to improve" and "open up a new path," and puts forward three negative phenomena in today's comedy world, which is naturally an undeniable contribution.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, today's comedy, besides "invisibly turning into ditties," is also almost like the "Xiao Re Hun" selling candy in the old countryside, entering the realm of boring nonsense. The reason is that the general public regards comedy as a kind of vulgar entertainment, a pastime for women and children, and is unwilling to pay attention to it. The comedic world itself often sees itself as not being on the grand stage, and inevitably abandons itself. Therefore, the worsening situation of comedy is undeniable. Therefore, I hope that the comedic world will improve. I think the cultural world at least cannot sit idly by. In addition to correcting and guiding it, it should also provide powerful assistance, such as compiling scripts. The comedic world is limited by its own lack of knowledge. It is inevitable to buy tunes to make scripts, and this is more meaningful than just making things up casually. At the same time, the comedic world does not have to belittle itself, thinking that it is only a tool for people to joke with its humorous talent, and has little connection with society. You must know that a word and a sentence are enough to affect every woman and child. This important task cannot be shirked.</p>
<p>Although today's isolated island is suffocating to the point where people can't breathe, I think the comedic world can change its style a little and perhaps have a great future by transporting some relaxing stimulation!</p>
<h3>The beautiful Ann Rutherford in a scene from MGM's new film "Pride and Prejudice"</h3>
<h3>The Pharmaceutical Association's Public Performance of "Cold Rice"</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>The drama club of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Students Association gave its fourth public performance last night. When I went to watch, the first play, "The Moon Rises," was already coming to an end. The plot of the second play, "Cold Rice," is: Ye Shaoqing (played by Guanghui), a Chinese employee in a foreign bank, is inherently thrifty. Because the lunch provided in the bank is too expensive, he brings cold rice every day to fill his stomach. He considers his wife, Peiling (played by Naijiao), to be virtuous and keeps all his savings with her. The upstairs of the house is sublet to save expenses. The tenant works on a ship and rarely comes home. His wife, Luoying (played by Weihun), likes to gamble and buy lottery tickets. Shaoqing doesn't think so, because he knows that his wife is diligent and reliable and doesn't associate with them, so he is indifferent. In the bank for fifteen years, he suffered the foreign people's contempt for the Chinese. One day, he couldn't bear it anymore and resolutely resigned, thinking that all the savings in the past fifteen years could be brought back to his hometown, and the couple could run a small business and make a living. Unexpectedly, after arriving home, when he told his wife about his resignation and his ideals in detail, his wife suddenly changed her usual state and almost went crazy. At first, he was confused. After questioning, he learned that his wife was seduced by Luoying, who lived with them, and often went to the gambling house and bought lottery tickets. All the savings over the years had been spent. Therefore, his beautiful dream of returning to his hometown was shattered. He suffered the foreign people's contempt in the past fifteen years, and his life's work was wasted. He couldn't help but feel frustrated. His wife, who had been tempted by others and was unfaithful to her husband, also felt resentful and wanted to die. Then, Shaoqing thought that since things were like this and the money was spent, if his wife committed suicide, what would he do? He tried to persuade his wife to correct her mistakes and work together to struggle again. Weihun expressed romanticism, and Guanghui acted passionately. The three people's performances were all in line with the identities of the characters in the play, so they won a lot of applause. Shanghai is a mixed place, and this kind of situation is probably not uncommon. I hope that young couples living in Shanghai should be particularly cautious when interacting with their neighbors to avoid repeating this mistake.</p>
<h3>Jeanette Gaynor's Post-Marriage Chat</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Jeanette Gaynor, the veteran "little sister" on the screen who shook the world with the film "Seventh Heaven," seems to have been out of the news for a long time. In fact, she has been very active and has recently had a son.</p>
<p>Since Jeanette Gaynor fell in love a few years ago and formed an unbreakable bond with her close friend, fashion designer Art Ringling, she was opposed by both parties involved. Jeanette ignored everything and escaped from Hollywood with her lover. People in the film industry were as shocked as a bolt from the blue. They were shocked that the union of men and women in Hollywood was originally extremely casual and had never been blocked. Why did Jeanette have to make such a fuss? But later they learned that the two had been living in Hollywood's neighboring state, Arizona, not far from California, and got married last August.</p>
<p>Since the first half of this year, there have been rumors about her. Some said that she would make a comeback and sign a contract with Fox. Some said that she had bought a lot of film company stocks and was determined to make a grand plan. None of these have been confirmed. According to recent reliable news, their love has crystallized. She gave birth to a boy who weighed seven pounds at birth. Jeanette Gaynor loves this child very much. She specially adopted the surnames of both parents and named the child "Quino Artling," hoping that this child will inherit the mantle of his parents in the future. It is heard that Jeanette, after her thirty-fourth birthday in October this year, is determined to decline all miscellaneous affairs and specialize in educating her son.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>Ballad in Prose: Twenty Varieties (18) Double Pearl Ball</h3>
<p>— Dong Yun, Xiu Yan</p>
<p>"Double Pearl Ball" can also be said to be "Double Double Pearl Ball." In addition to a pair of pearl balls in the book, there are also two people named Zhu Qiu. These two Zhu Qiu not only have the same surname but even have the same appearance.</p>
<p>Zeng Shen has the same name, Confucius and Yang Huo have the same appearance. As for those with the same surname and appearance, it seems to be the only case in history!</p>
<p>The characters on the stage include treacherous kings, lecherous monks, beauties, and heroes.</p>
<p>The plot is quite lively, with "Knot Stick" and "Kill Fight" "Full martial arts," and also delicate and tender "love scenes." "Breaking Yanqing Temple" and "Blood Splattering Ningwang Mansion" are two shocking "scenes" of "small books, big stories" in "Double Pearl Ball."</p>
