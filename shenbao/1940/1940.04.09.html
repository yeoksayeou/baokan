<h3 id="c17">歐戰第二期開始歟 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>歐洲的戰局，雖屢次盛傳西綫劇戰，行將展開，但到現在爲止，雙方策略，都以「固守爲最佳的進攻」。凡所努力，皆在中立國的如何爭取，經濟封鎖戰與反封鎖戰的如何進行；一言以蔽之，皆爲如何守以困弱對方而已。然而軍事方面的對壘，雖祗見西綫的嚴陣以待，而外交的攻勢與經濟的攻勢，却遍於整個的歐洲，甚至超越歐洲範圍，而觸鬚遠　全世界。經過了七個月的期間而到現在，外交與經濟戰爭，可以說已趨於白熱化的階段。以歐洲而論，北自斯干蒂那維亞各國，南自巴爾幹各國，雖則那些國家。鎗砲之聲無聞，表面上尙能保持其中立體態；可是對壘中的幾個大國，並沒有放鬆他們，使他們的處境，日趨困難；飄蕩而來的火藥氣息，隨時有觸發他們的火藥庫的可能。而其主觀的「中立」，即將隨交戰國經濟攻勢的開展而在客觀上喪失其中立的完整了。最近就在這樣局勢的轉捩階段。英國海相邱吉爾在三月三十一日廣播演說中謂：「戰爭即將趨於激烈，但無論如何，吾人決不自餒。吾人深知央法兩國民族，今後均須作最大努力。」所謂戰爭將趨於激烈，邱吉爾並沒有說明爲何種戰爭。不過照英國首相張伯倫四月二日在下院的演說，說明協約國決心加强各種封鎖政策；又說英政府必盡力做到斷絕斯干蒂那維亞鐵的輸德，及警吿中立國的助德；這已無異於暗示了。中立國如果助德，將遭受可怕的命運。這種宣示，決非虛　恫嚇，目前業已先後見諸事實的，是（一）照會挪威。吿以協約國實行加緊封鎖，禁止任何船舶，載運戰時違禁品，通過挪威領海；並且已在挪威領海的某某區域內敷設水雷。（二）法國封鎖　長蒙那特與英國戰時經濟部長克勞斯舉行加緊封鎖的談話，作技術上的重要決定。（三）英國外相哈利法克斯召集駐在巳爾幹各國的使節返國，指示機宜；並與巴爾幹各國的駐英使節開始談判，務期巴爾幹各國的貿易，傾向英法，而將原來供給德國的各種物資，轉而供給英法。以其雷厲風行的姿態，施其恩威並濟的政策，主旨所在，無非奪取中立國，使德國在經濟上不能取得原料而自趨崩潰「加緊」之下，挪威首當其衝，昨夜且已發宣言，表示反對英法的措施，同時亦自行在領海內敷設水雷，以維持其中立。在我們沒有詳知其性質時候，甚可認爲這是挪威的正當而公道的自衛措施；但在事實上又與參加對德封鎖有何區別？這是微妙的現象，欲知後果，且看前途！</p>
<p>至於巴爾幹各國，介于德義兩大之間，其勢甚難擺脫德國經濟勢力的侵入。英法雖欲在「德國抵觸中立國權利時」，對於這些國家加以援助，但在英法與巴爾幹的地理上，在英法對巴爾幹的行動上，空間時間，皆有其相富距離，這眞是一個艱鉅的事實問題啊。這在巴爾幹各國，旣有波蘭捷克的前車之鑒，無論對英法如何同情，但對於德國經濟上的要求，恐不能因英法的聲言決心加緊封鎖而立即有改絃易轍的勇氣。於此推測，英法政策在巴爾幹方面所可期待的成就，至少並非即在目前。歐戰原有兩種可能發展，到了昨今，則歐戰火燄的先向斯干蒂那　亞各　蔓延，成爲當然的論斷了。</p>
<p>當去年作戰的最初，英國軍艦即深入波羅的海口上的設得蘭島之東，這是表現了英國海軍戰略輸廓的一面。原來就海軍數量方面言之，根據一九三八年九月底的統計；英國一國的各級軍艦，共有三百零一艘之多，而德國只有六十五艘，殆爲五與一的比例，相差已鉅；而英艦共一百三十餘萬噸，德艦共十三萬五千噸，殆爲十與一的比例，相差更鉅。如此實力的懸殊，眞是鋼鐵一般的事實。現在爲了斯干蒂那維亞半島，亦即爲了挪威的中立體態，英德兩國將在這一方面短兵相接；而這一方面的交綏，凡是外交，政治，經濟的戰爭，與所謂宣傳或神經戰爭，到現階段皆放過去，而以海軍爲唯一的主力了。我們不能想像德國克然與英國在這一方面作海上的殊死戰，然想像英國在這一方面的嚴格封鎖。六體應爲沒有問題的成功。</p>
<p>歐洲發生戰事、到現在七個月；而這一次以挪威爲問題的中心，却將演爲歐戰第二期的開始！</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3 id="c61">夫婦是生殖的結合 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科　畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>故應注意生殖的衛生</p>
<p>夫婦婚後之衛生，其影響不僅個人的幸福攸關，而對於妻子及整個家庭的組織，也發生密切的關係，故若於婚後而始去研究衛生之道，未免有臨渴掘井之譏，是故應於婚前善自注意，原來夫婦之結合，全在生殖慾望上，使除去性關係，即無夫婦之可言，古人謂：親莫親乎父子，而暱莫暱乎夫婦，其實父子雖屬天倫，而其情則遠不若夫婦，厚於妻而薄於親者，幾千分中有九百九十九之多，其能孑孑獨造，厚於妻而薄於親者，則千之中不及一也，豈天倫之愛不若夫婦之愛，蓋一則僅有天性之親，而一則中含有性的關係，故性關係實爲結合夫婦愛情之唯一工具，亦即婚後衛生之重要注意點，苟夫婦身無疾病，於生殖機能上能互相合作，則相親相愛，縱有意見上之參差，總能諒解。此應加以注意者也。</p>
<p>至於生殖機能之衛生法，雖是醫生也難盡知，我們要討論這些事實，得先對於性的病態有簡單的敍述，基於婚後最易罹患者，以早洩一症爲最多，在婚前常常遺精的人，差不多均難避免，早洩即因精力渙散，即吿射精之謂，故易引起愛情上的糾紛，不過患此者，儘可利用靑春腺內分泌療法，使之澈底治愈，若放任不治，則病象日趨險惡，延及全身，如面色蒼白，肌肉削瘦，頭腦脹痛，精神萎靡，健忘失眠，婚後不妊，市上靑春腺素製劑最佳者，首推德國睪丸精質製劑男用『補體康」服後早洩卽除，體力健全，腦力振作，新陳代謝之機能促進，肌肉壯茁，面色紅潤，該劑藥力週到，甘四小時即生精補腎，英國名醫司托克博士，年來積極採用該劑，據渠語人，「補體康」一藥其成分不含雜質，絕不刺戟腸胃，故其功效爲他種補劑所難望其項背，故婚後衰弱者本品爲最對症之良藥。</p>
<h3 id="c62">從理論談到試驗的治淋新法 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>今日言淋病治療，非空談足以取信於人。亦非普通製劑所能奏功若專言藥效。又必失於誇大。皆非學者態度。故余概不取乎此。顧余自負笈美邦。於淋病療法。亦頗耽心硏究。用新科學方法而證諸余在美利堅花柳病院實習時，互相證明治淋之途徑據余考察，淋病拜有抗除全身淋毒療法，才不致掛一漏萬之弊，因爲具此功效，能昂盛人體各部組織之每一細胞，以行其掃滅淋菌之作用，則淋病無論新久，如局部之尿道淋，慢性之攝護腺及睪丸炎女子陰門淋子宮炎，及淋毒性白帶等，不但霍然並治，即全身傳染之眼結膜炎，心瓣炎，關節炎，皆可迅速全部根治。</p>
<p>抗除全身淋毒，確是根治一切白濁最周密而合理想之學說，其後由德國彼德博士採取衆長精勤硏究，而發明『克淋儂」一藥，其成分蓋取特製蛋白體黃色素等配合而成者，故服之能昂奮細胞，抗淋噬菌之作用，故余在美時，卽已賞用此藥，而彼邦花柳病院中之淋科主任醫師，一致推崇『克淋儂』功效之神驗，其在急性淋時，服此藥一二星期內即見功效？而且在此短期中斷根，至慢性淋濁，亦可於四五期中斷根外用藥方面，則「抗淋水」一藥，作爲尿道洗滌，亦具優良成績，「抗淋水」太和大藥房有售）</p>

<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>大家都知道，凡是具有肺癆質之人，其肺臟異常脆弱，實在經不起怎樣震動，而在這震動中肺臟細血管震破而出血，此種使肺臟受到震動的無過於咳嗽，故咳嗽與吐血有密切的關係，此實極顯明之事，要防吐血，先當鎮咳，而能使咳嗽在三小時內鎮靜的，惟有『補肺拿爾』一藥，足可當之，故暖嗽時服用此藥，可預防肺出血，此乃余二十年來經驗所得之正確結果。</p>
<h3 id="c64">淋病講座　淋病之全盤治法說 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>治淋綱要</p>
<p>淋病本是一種難於處理之花柳病。因爲淋病之病原菌——卽雙球菌。具有十分頑强善戰本能。又能匿藏深奧之所在。所以要用某一種療法以肅除淋菌。最佳還在急性時期，但不是說急性淋病一旦過去，而說慢性白濁卽無法醫治，治淋之實際是如何防止淋菌之深入。旣經深入如何可以迅速撲滅之。以斷絕其繁殖，而作負隅之困鬥。以消耗病人體力</p>
<p>療法商榷</p>
<p>淋病治療，因其重要關頭，在於除淋，但是淋菌在於何處，則非行精密之科學診斷法不可，故醫家當在診斷淋病時，幸勿以「老馬識途」經騐豐富負責，醫家經驗，固屬必要，但仍須細心檢查病患，然後對症下藥，庶幾無誤病情，對於各種療法，尤宜截長補短，若謂一種病而始終專用某一種療法，未免失之於偏，若余治療淋病，十數年來，已不知凡幾，深知此中利害。</p>
<p>全盤治療</p>
<p>由於淋菌逃竄無方，變症百出，故必有全盤周密之療法。而德國靜電療法，對於淋菌之窠穴，旣有澈底完全撲滅之偉效，兼之更輔服淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，使其內部各細胞發生抗淋噬菌之微妙作用，因之較諸一般一枝一節之局部手術療法，自然安全而周密得多，在淋病患者如轉入關節炎，則德國抗淋血淸，亦可作靜脈注射，以撲滅血行中之淋毒，及分解關節之愈着，更佳，診時上午十時至下午六時，自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無變動、英美匯暗市、極少波折、期貨鬆勢有加、現貨則與上週末不分榮辱、乃因一般經營者、捨近期而就遠期、但動作乏勸勁、致影響至微、晨開平態依然、不久華行吐出居先、外行照納、故買賣兩平、十時後、市上續有華行頭寸散出、而投機商亦互有塞出、於是期貨已呈鬆象、迄晚收止、交易淸稀、結果現貨一致未動、期貨均吿微硬、</p>
<p>期貨鬆勢漸厲</p>
<p>晨初以海外匯兌、英對美·滬·法等俱平、美對英長半分、對滬未更、對法升一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元一五六二五、與上週六收市均平、同時期貨開出、亦均吿平定開後華行首來吐出、計華行與外行對做現美匯六元一五六二五、市面仍平、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、迨至十時後、華行續有塞出、兼投機商等跟踪拋賣、致斯時期貨已見硬化、本月份美匯六元〇九三五可結、計外行有利曾吸入華行·大陸及上海本月份美匯六元〇九三七五、五月份五元九三七五、而華商售予外行本月份美匯爲六元一二五、迄午收無有重大變化、現貨均與晨開相仿、期貨英金本下月俱鬆〇一五六二五、美匯亦各長〇三一二五、</p>
<p>午後幾無上落</p>
<p>市狀况甚靜、幾無上落、計美行曾入華行大陸本月份美滙六元一二五、後美行賣予外行有利本月份美匯亦爲六元一二五、收盤結果現貨英金與美匯仍吿四辦士一二五、及六元一五六二五、本月份美金爲四辦士〇七八一二五、美匯爲六元〇九三七五、五月份英金爲三辦七〇九八四三七五、美滙爲五元九三七五、較上週六現貨求有差別、本月份英金美匯各鬆〇一五六二五與〇三一二五、五月份亦俱硬〇一五六二五及〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港英美平穩</p>
<p>香港八日（週一）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、英匯現期貨均不動、美匯現貨亦開原盤、遠期則縮〇六二五、爲二十二元、申匯現貨降一元、爲三百五十九元、日匯現貨長半元、爲九十四元、十一時三十分平穩、各滙概無變動、下午二時三十分開盤、仍吿平穩、各匯均無榮辱、</p>

<p>金市疲莫能興　跌進四百元大關</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、疲莫能興、接連之挫跌、已達六天、蓋滙市之平中趨鬆、人心對購金興趣、相常减少、再因環境毫無刺激、價遂難以提升、本日初開即撳十五元、爲五千四白十元、尙屬當日高盤、後况更劣、乃因外滙期貨、聞又報硬、銀號帮及散戶羣集吐售、一時供求懸殊、慘落至五千四百元關內、爲五千三百七十五元、入後尙幸設券帮儘力維持、金號曁錢兌業亦不時收吸、浮剩之籌碼漸形緊縮、卒以五千三百九十七元收盤、結果較上週末再軋低二十八元、全天交易的二千餘兩、銀樓飾金未見更動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤已連小六天</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人氣仍疲、賣者頗多、首由證券帮吐予銀號十兩、爲五千四百十元、較之前收做小十五元、嗣後買者多呈旁觀、反之賣風更濃、金號及散戶等爭先力塞、不久即又做小三十元、金號吐予錢兌業等共五十兩、爲五千三百八十元、但其時某錢兌業首肯撈入、金號亦跟蹤收買、而賣戶已漸少、途回起十八元、證劵帮出金號二十兩、、爲五千三百九十八元、此後因外滙期貨報硬、進者頓中止活動、銀號帮傾向吐出、步跌二十三元、銀號互做五十兩、爲五千三百七十五元、旋錢兌業與金號見賤又撈、重又回升二十二元、金號進錢兌業三十兩、爲五千三百九十七元、午刻卒因銀號帮多頭復來出籠、且斯時錢兌業亦懷賣意、再見步跌十七元、銀號出錢兌業十兩、爲五千三百八十元作午收價、午後初開平疲、首由錢兌業出銀號十兩、仍爲五千三百八十元、少頃證券帮忽來搜入、立抬起八元、證券帮進錢兌業三十兩、爲五千三百八十八元、但某銀號賣意轉濃、又力塞數十兩、重又撳低六元、銀號出錢兌業三十兩、爲五千三百八十二元、後以證券帮再來扒進、而銀號已無賣意、且共他售者察落、遂再回高十五元、證劵帮進金號廿兩、爲五千三百九十七元作晚收價、結果比上週末又跌二十八元、查已連小六天、共計一百五十八元、全天祇三十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高敬元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金始終無變</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、始終無變、大同行仍懸五百四十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<p>貼現再小四元　拆息回升二分</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、繼續下低、每千元上午由六十四元步低至六十元、下午稍回上至六一尤、比上週六再小四元、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均掛二角、　掛升二分云、</p>
<h3 id="c82">外幣漲跌不一 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨烚赤市價繼續下游、美金票終因遠期外匯軋長而續跌、初做十六元一角五分、旋更步降至十六元零七分、後又曾回上至十六元一角二分、午間復退至十六元零七分、午後父曾高至十六元一角四分、晚市復退至十六元一角一分、英金票供求仍平、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲、法郞票趨勢甚挺、新加坡票及斐律濱票不乏需要、市價一致挺漲、日金票晨間漲風甚熾、一度曾到一元三角三分、午後稍起回風、晚市爲一元三角二分、朝鮮票需要仍旺、晚市高至一元一角二分五厘、昨日市價、計英美金鎊均跌五角、于美金票降六分、香港票則漲一分、法郞票升二厘、新加坡票高一角、斐律濱票漲五分、餘俱不動、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤昨日市況仍屬堅穩、交易雖略形減少、趨勢因賣戶無大量而轉形籌礁短缺、銀行押款困難、亦一重大原因、丙種第九次抽籤、准明日上午舉行、是以今日午後交易、即行除中籤計算、此次抽籤支數、雖仍祗八支、而人心存中籤希望者較上次爲熱烈、故抽籤後行市若無環境上之變化、行市尙不易遽跌、昨日經過、初本有看小之勢、旋以二十號及倩孚兩家進胃較鉅、一般人心爲之轉移、生大潤利以及散戶亦均傾向買進、市上祗聯益久豐昌記以及零星散戶逢高賣出、午前市價即行回好二三角、午後廿號及信孚進胃仍濃、十六號買乙種亦頗踴躍、餘如震康順泰益昌久豐亦均相當收入、同康鴻大久孚供出雖多、未能將多方氣勢壓倒、結果一律回好二三角、又成交總數約一百萬元有零、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交漢冶萍股一百股、價爲四元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市、因係交易週之開始日、交易極端龐大、午後市况、分外活潑、價格一有回風、買方即來提拉、英聯股漲勢甚銳、一度曾見四十四元、但此價招致獲利者湧售、收盤回至四十二元、揚子銀公司最近甚被忽視、昨又生氣勃勃、獲有新的助力、成交七萬股、價格漲達十七元半、衡量成交之鉅、漲風似不爲過、怡和紗廠股成交不大、收盤亦漲至四十七元·中國墾植股開盤價爲十七元六角、開後直上靑雲、創見十九元四角高價、雖是價招致不少獲利了結、但買戶在收盤時十九元開外價仍然盡情吸收、不肯放鬆、是股之受人歡迎、可謂至矣、</p>
<p>橡皮股成交較少、但公衆對此、似亦有相當興趣、收盤價堅穩、</p>

<p>紗市由疲轉緊、此因華南一帶需求繼續不懈、因此華紗漲風復熾、期貨交易雖吿停頓、一般經濟充裕者、對於現貨吸收囤藏矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因四月期互相結價、市情平疲、二十支雙馬現紗價始做一千一百十二元、旋聞客帮需要良好、廣帮納胃仍暢、在市搜羅者頗不乏人、以後現貨逐步做至一千一百四十八元、比上日漲三十三元、查半日成交統計一千五百六十五包、行情仍屬趨升、昨有棉紗六十件運福建、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易平平、惟美棉成交殊旺、廠方日商採辦獨健、華廠納胃頗狹、所以行情穩而靜、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<p>米特林　一七五·七五　二六五·五〇　同行進　七〇〇件</p>

<p>大中集　一三三·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即因旱區得雨及現貨商之賣出、加之週末之故、市况未能振作、結果收盤價格較之上日跌二三磅音、印度連同預測猛漲十羅比、埃及漲三五磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日雖印度市況之轉堅、但因滙兌之略鬆、紗價又趨平平、同業心意、又以市上銀根奇緊、將來之棉市又難捉摸、且廠方近又有大批印棉之訂購、故同業心意又趨淡薄、暫擬峪略觀望云云、昨日交易頗爲靜寂、茲將昨棉市以美滙六元一二五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>生油　昨日油市塲中之市况、頗多起伏、晨初因黃豆趨勢平穩、人心尙取觀望、市少嚴重變化、入後花生油突有杳港帮問津、兼之帶來產價騰漲之訊、致市塲中人心激昂、充滿利多空氣貨主一意猛抬、喊價橫升、結果比上週休市前（四日）之價、暴提六元外、成交膠州油五百件、價爲七十四尤、及烟台聽裝油二千五百聽、價爲九十六元五角、</p>
<p>豆油　市因生油之劇烈波動、行情初開即跳漲二元、中途由一部份有力者乘機塞出、市氣頓受打擊、一度曾回瀉一二元、結局雖仍漲二元、但其潛勢尙乏穩健力量、昨統市做開大連油六百餘桶、（價詳市價欄）、靑島油六十桶、江北油卅桶、蚌埠油十桶、及大有廠油三百担查豆油昨由靑島來七十件、又豆餅今（九日）有一萬六千張、運往泉州、又有肥田粉三千包、運往福建、</p>

<p>昨糖市、據荷蘭電訊、粗白照C.I.F.&amp;KG例荷幣九·一〇計升三角、因該電到遲、故本市公會劃盤尙未見好、今日或將轉升、二四粗砂白現貨、外棧新貨六十二元、老貨六十一元八角、太古車白更見呆滯、B嘜西棧六十八元一角、CW嘜西棧六十七元八角、CX嘜西棧六十七元半、DY嘜西棧六十七元二角、HX嘜西棧六十七元、東棧遂退三角、餘無更動、國糖建帮開出少數色較决之漳赤價開四十元、又昨由荷蘭來糖一千三百五十噸、又由海口來七十七包、</p>

<p>國布　昨市晨平午堅、仍現銷暢旺、紗價激增之故、各貨售盤一致挺秀、漂布每疋漲五角、色布色斜漲二角半至五角、細布斜紋漲一角至二角半、粗布以十六磅十四磅最爲堅俏、川滇帮辦色布粗布等一千餘件、粵間帮辦色布府綢粗布等四百餘件、溫甬帮辦漂布元色洋紗府綢細布等三百餘件、本街成交各貨五六百件、</p>
<p>東布　昨以市塲限制不得再做期貨、晨盤平疲、龍頭細布現出售開三十二元七角、詎後市本街實需旺盛、中檔細布現貨與棧單相差每疋達二角半、同時因棉紗回升、囤戶復來搜羅、龍頭收盤竟又見新高價、售開每疋三十三元二角、嗶嘰每碼升至九角九分七五、聞漢口高檔本色細布每疋須日金三十元、的合法幣三十七元八角、日商直接裝邋、每疋除水脚的一元五角、則由滬輸漢利益殊厚、故連日細布之直裝長江一帶者爲數甚巨、</p>

<p>兎子呢、女飾服裝帮皆有需要、尤以四馬路一帶交易更健、本市仕女春大衣、爭着兎子呢、菜綠色及淡紅灰色更爲風行、但爲存貨苦薄、新貨成本高昂、售價極貴、無如上海女子多不惜代價、十之八九貪共質輕　、全毛織成、只要一襲穿身、大有如海白龍大衣一般、非着兎子呢、不算時髦出風頭、昨該什色頭號兎子呢每碼沾二十六元、二號二十二三元、三號普通悉售二十元光景、</p>

<p>橫濱絲價回升、現貨做開一千四百五十元、漲六十元近期一千四自七十元、漲七十一元、遠期一千四百五十元、漲三十五元、然觀察市氣、終將趨弱、蓋出新之前、一面要抬高市價、以脫售存貨、而另一面將價抑低、以利繭收、故目前絲價之上落、係爲大跌小回頭也、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、昨有五十担成交、絲價已呈回蘇、白頭洋行亦有成交、請見市價表、又有黃絲二十四包、昨由烟台運來、</p>

<p>米市目前星期日例假休業一天後、厚薄粳及早晚稱等國米、傳言已久不日開禁之說、雖未見正式宣佈、却已見諸事實、由日人主持之虹口大昌公司、已向內地淑寗常宜蘇嘉路一帶搬運來滬、首批已到達者、業有一萬餘包、後批尙有繼續、故　山虹口區轉入界內者、計有粳糯四五千包、若南港斛見早晚稻業在市上大量兜銷、且售價更廉、跌進四十元限盤、祇售二十九元三十八元半、其他厚薄粳雖尙乏正常交易、都屬暗盤、然聞貨旺亦一致趨下、常帮高粳已僅開四十三元半、中市者四十元、蘇崑粳四十二元半、四十二元、黎盛粳四十一二元、靑泗特薄四十二元、中關四十一元左右、比之前市削落元半光景、糯米市貨旣豐、更漕粳尖雙重壓迫、雖盤已如是之賤、而卒乏受主、行情維瀉元砠、除高持貨售三十五元半外、餘則悉祇在三十四五元之間、糯米市至此地步、誠昔所未見、於各色洋米、備受國米</p>
<p>至於各色洋米、備受國米影響、更雖立足、一般貨主本以一俟四月份期貨解淸後未續訂、所有來貨可握住、多無輕售之意、茲則國米來源突有疏通、且已大量抵埠、浮囤散戶、爭相出售、無如市面不可搖動、一經搖動、任你喊破喉嚨、皆見袖手、相打少對手、市貨充斥、洋米與國米混成一團、更無有躉數交易、結果、收盤行情已猛瀉一二元不等、一號西貢祇四十一元、四十元零五角、二號三十七元半、火絞四十元、二號暹邏三十七元半、小絞三十七元、混合碎三十三元、次至卅元、米菉三十五元七角、三十五元半、回顧大局米市溯自客歲突飛猛漲、無非因當時內地來源、陡吿斷絕、滬埠食米不敷、有以致之、乃後設計訂購洋米、雖曾一度回平、然以杯水車薪、低而復昂、其間雖亦不乏有投機操縱者之壟斷、總爲國米爲人控制、近則利歸獨享、販運可通、則米價之平復、必有一日、然必暢通無阻、源源不絕、苛捐雜稅、悉行捐除、民食方有稍蘇之望也、</p>

<p>工部局董事競選、自昨晨起、已進入一更緊張之階段、蓋決勝之期已迫、而自明日起、（十日十一日）即行開始投票也、此次選舉結果、與租界前途、最有關係、蓋租界行政、此後、否將由日人統制或被攫取其一部份、抑爲可保持原狀、均視此次選舉結果而定、其最應為中我外人士所嚴重注意者、如日方以其他方法攫取租界行政管理權、則日人勢將受中外人士之攻擊、英美必向日方提出嚴重抗議、認為日方違背國際公法、然如日人以競選之方法而獲得租界管理權、則第三國無法覓得抗議之理由、故此次之競選、鹿死誰手、實與租界前途有莫大之關係也、故據另一美僑聲稱、渠雖平時對工部局之行政方針、不甚感覺興趣、但渠亦認爲如日人之威脅手段不致實現、則租界前途及工部局將來當更有利、</p>
<p>華人方面　深予重視</p>
<p>公共租界工部局本屆董事選舉、除華籍董事五人、仍由華人納稅代表推舉虞洽卿·袁履登·江一平·奚玉書·郭順連任外、其餘英·美·日籍董事、已定於明日及後日七午十時至下午三時在萬國商團操練所及虹口小菜塲舉行、因日方本屆突將候選人增至五人、冀藉玫治攻勢、以實現變更租界現有狀態之企圖、連日英美曁日籍僑民間從事競選之熱烈、司謂已臻白熱化、茲者選期臨邇、勝負誰屬、即將於兩日內分曉、此事因關係整個租界行政、深爲各方所關切、華人方面、雖保持靜默態度、但亦一致予以重視、據納稅華人某君稱、外僑競選董事席數、輒以人口增加納稅增加爲藉口、實則華人佔人口絕對多數、而納稅負担、亦以華人爲最重、故市政設施、萬勿應漠視華人之福利云</p>
<p>競選已入　最後階段</p>
<p>大陸報云、從八日起之一星期、爲公共租界有史以來罕遇之重要時期、蓋工部局董事競選問題、將見分曉、而日人是否獲得工部局之控制權、抑現狀能予維持、或董事比例稍有更變、將在此一週內決定也、選舉日期爲星期三及四日、競選運動已入最後階段、各國僑民均有激烈活動、日入圖獲控制力、將遭各方之劇烈競爭、</p>
<p>兩方力量　不相上下</p>
<p>今有主力兩個、互相對峙、實力幾相均等、今度日方投票權的有三千七百權、英美投票權、昨日估計的三千五百權者、聞刻正增加中、因有選舉資格之英美納稅人、目下猶有赴工部局登記者、有選舉權之少數僑民、似亦分成兩派、一爲拉丁僑民、即葡萄牙與義大利、聞皆堅決在日人方面、並料一部份德僑與白俄、亦將選舉日方五候選人、德備選舉權共的七百權、似亦分成擁護及反對「阿里安種人」兩派、後者多係猶太難民、</p>
<p>政治作用　殊堪玩味</p>
<p>昨據某難民聲稱、日人在此方面所用方法、與希特勒崛起初期所用者、頗相類似、日方活動、傳係完全合法者、則希特勒亦然、此乃一旦掌權後將有何事發生之問題云、又據消息靈通方面聲稱、日人苟獲公共租界之控制權、則第三國亦不能根據「非法一或違背國際公法而提出抗議、目下局勢、實係半極權國家、利用所謂民治方法、企圖擊敗民治國、</p>
<p>局方獲得　良好敎訓</p>
<p>又某美僑昨稱、渠誠嫌惡工部局之方法、日人稱覇之威脅、苟未得逞、則此種威脅、對於工部局與公共租界居民、至少有一良好影響、今局方秉政者、驚惶已極、將不得不施行嚴峻之改革辦法、納稅人亦已醒覺、將在競選後要求局方有所行動云、</p>
<p>日方誣蔑　英人可笑</p>
<p>日方所指公共租界警務處派員於本月五日在匯山區脅迫猶太難民不得選舉日方候選人一節、昨經匯山捕房警員切實否認、上說載於日文上海每日新聞、同盟社譯出轉發、略謂五日午後三時許、穿制服之英警員七名、與華警員二十名、集於唐山路八百號附近、英警員挨戶訪猶太難民、查問彼等將選何人、及彼等與日人之關係、然後錄下難民答語、英警員此舉、越其權限、實乃干涉競選云、據警務處人員昨告記者、此乃宣傳胡言、不啻可哂之神話云、聞工部局或將就此訊、向日總領署提出抗議、惟消息靈通方面以爲警務處殆將不予理會、以其荒謬可笑、不値重視也、</p>
<p>印發名單　喚起注意</p>
<p>據日方英美選舉委員會爲使第三國籍選舉人、羣起贊助英美候選者、將印發本屆董事候選人名單、將英美日各候選人姓各一併記入、惟所用字體、則有分別、英美候選人中、除雷諾麥唐納律師外、餘七人皆用大寫、使第三國籍投票者集中注意於七人、又準備以汽車接送第三國籍選舉人、如第三國籍選舉人需要乘汽車、至選舉塲投票、可依照指定之電話號碼、吿以姓名住所、即派汽車前往迎接、此種辦法、亦另有印刷品通知、</p>
<p>德報見嫉　竟遭沒收</p>
<p>據昨日自權威方面探悉、日軍便衣隊一小隊、昨日上午八時左右、在虹口區內收沒大量德文「黃報、」據傳該報曾刊有不利於日方競選之消息、日軍便衣隊昨日分頭向各報灘及商店將寄售之該報、的共一千份、（每份售價一角）全數沒收、執行時並未宣佈任何理由、亦未付分文代價、捕房方面、對日方此種舉動、並未進而干涉、又據探悉該報在過去數星期中曾大事刋載贊助英美候選人之消息、在文字內雖未明白勸吿猶人、加以擁護、但日人認爲此舉足以影響共競選也、該報刋有一文、警吿行賄而利用目前特殊狀態、於中取利者、在將來必受中國政府之懲處、另有一文則謂、猶太難民小獨應感謝上帝、得獲逃出德境、且應感謝在滬加以優容之各民主國家、彼等應知在各民主國家所建立之區域內居住、實爲無上之幸福、固不應德對日人之尤許登陸、而知感激也、該報又刊載猶太難民協會之通吿、勸吿猶太難民應於此次競選中、保持中立、於不得已時、可放棄投票、蓋偏護任何一方、均足以樹敵也、該報對於美僑、獨抱絕對擁護之態度、該報指美人以庚子賠款建立學校醫院、而使東方與西方之關係更爲密切、實可稱頌、</p>
<p>親自投票　無法越俎</p>
<p>日方選舉委員會、昨日上午在日人俱樂部開各部主任會議、下午各部委員又開會、今日上下午、尙須開會二次、（各部委員）在日　方面、初以為選舉人本身不到、可托人代理投票、但現已明瞭代理投票之方、絕不許可、故其選舉委員會、昨又發出呼籲、希望各有選舉權之日僑、屆時務須抽暇前往投票、如選舉人仍有不能明瞭之事項、可向各區選舉主任詢問、</p>
<p>日方威迫　猶人助威</p>
<p>日人爭取猶人贊助之方法、目今已切實施行、據談在虹口區內、凡表示願投票贊助日僑候選人者、均已獲得日方之許可證、尤許彼之親友來滬、又據探悉、有獲得許可證而事實上不需要者、均由於許可證獲得厚利、蓋每張許可證、可售得　千元也、在虹口日已設有所謂選舉宣傳處、該會復遣派善操德語之宣傳員、四出活動、要求猶人投票贊助日僑候選人、否則彼等及親友將有不利、但觀察家均明認爲此種恫嚇、實無多大效用、蓋選舉票完全密封、日人難以調查投票人姓名也、</p>
<p>利用白俄　散發傳單</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上星期六夜、霞飛路有失業白俄多名、散發俄文傳單、此乃某力面勸吿納稅俄人務勿選舉英藉候選人之最近行動、傳單內容對英人抨擊甚烈、略稱、茲要求俄人非在工部局「佔得一二董事席」、則不應選舉「工部局紳士」、工部局英董每年競選時、籲請俄人　護、而許以虛僞之諾言、試以商團白俄隊爲例、足見英人需要援助時、始利用俄人、更以俄人移居來滬時之艱苦、與猶太移民抵此時之優待相較、有天壤之別、公共租界警務處為需人辦理俄人案件、而僱俄人警員、從無升至高位者、故納稅俄人不應選舉英人、而應選舉「行將援助俄人使之平等」之某國人、否則應投白票、「以示抗議」云、</p>
<p>謝米諾夫　為虎作倀</p>
<p>大陸報云、據可靠消息、滿境親日白俄團體領袖謝米諾夫、已於上月杪抵滬、刻仍在本市、謝氏有白俄保鑣一人隨行、出現於本市若干大旅館—聞謝氏係用華人之名、乘日船於三月二十九日抵滬後、已與上海日方軍事領袖數度會談、本市白俄方面認謝氏抵此、頗具重大意義、因工部局董事競選行將舉行、故謝氏來此、或與開始競選運動有關、謠傳謝氏今圖誘使多數白俄投票擁護日方五候選人</p>

<p>劃分權限</p>
<p>該會主幹會中幹事、前亦有以董事資格被選爲執行委員者、於權限上顯有混淆之嫌、茲查本屆董事會已公決凡以董事資格担任幹事之人員、不得冉舉爲執委、故該會立法行政二權、顯已彼此分立、</p>

<p>主持得人</p>
<p>該會董事會本屆並委聘有新幹事數人、如童克聖西敎士、對於文字事業、素有經騐、此次亦被選爲代理幹事、但最値吾人注意者、則爲朱立德氏被舉爲總幹事、查該會總幹事一職、五十三年來、皆由西人主持、雖西人中不乏賢能之士、但以之治中國之文字事業、究嫌隔靴搔癢、故本屆董事會即在舉一膺此大任之國人、以期達到以國人治本國文字事業之目的、聞朱氏向在中華基督敎協進會任副總幹事、於一九三七年八月受該會之聘、爲副總幹事、八一三滬變後、該會總幹事賈立言博士回美、由朱任代理之職、任內卓著助勞、中西人士備極推重、今董事會畀以此職、敎會人士咸慶得人、</p>

<p>該會出版委員會主席、前亦由西人充任、近則推舉滬江大學敎授徐寳謙博士主持、徐君對於文字造詣甚深、此後當另有一番貢獻、</p>

<p>該會新任總幹事爲刷新文字陣容　見、已馳函國內文化界、延聘一文字人才、並計劃與會外各機關合作、預料該會文字事業、不久當有嶄新之陣容與優良之演出也、</p>

<p>據确訊、國難雖日益嚴重、但該會去年一年初版再版之書籍、銷數竟突破歷年紀錄、每日平均約出書二種、可謂不脛而走、至各書內容、均大加改善、膚淺之內容、與不通之文字、已大見减少、</p>

<h3 id="c124">大學敎育的缺憾 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>讀了本刋方曉藍君的「大學生的話」，使我發生無限的感想。的確，道問題的重心，應在大學敎育的全身。一般大學生不能刻苦自勵鋰頭鑽硏，固然是他們自己的錯誤，應該加以針砭；而今日大學敎育的不能切合需要，不能負責指導靑年，也是無可辭其咎的。在一個不健全小合理的制度下，要希望陶鑄靑年的德性，造就優秀的人才，那當然是難能的事。大學生行動的囂張，學養的欠缺，僅不過顯示着大學敎育令人詬病的一面而已。</p>
<p>我們似乎只看見一般境遇優裕的大學生，終日出入於酒肆舞廳，追求聲色之樂，把時間精力消磨於無益之所，而視讀書為一種裝飾和點綴。因此大學生給人的印象，不是西裝革履的少爺，便是時裝燙髮的小姐。事實上，不要說在內地，就是上海，也儘多奮勉有爲孜孜苦讀的大學生，他們的讀書生活中，充滿了血淚。借貸，典質，奮鬥，掙扎，才能踏進大學之門。大學敎育的不健全不合理就在這裏：對於貧苦有志的靑年，不能儘量地使他們有讀書的機會，徒將神聖的敎育事業淪爲商品，反給一般浮蕩不覊的少爺小姐們玷汚了敎育的尊嚴。</p>
<p>今日大學敎育的癥結在偏重講義的傳授，知識的注入，只知灌輸舊經騐，而不能創造新文化。舉生能够記熟死的條文公式，似乎不必再運用活的思想了。讀完規定的學分就算畢業，並不計及學生實際的知能。空掛硏究學術的美名，和聯業活動與生活實踐絲毫不發生關聯。建築在經濟條件上的大學敎育所呈現的這些病態，難怪要給人訾議了。</p>
<p>就目前的情形看，中等以下家庭的子女，雖有志讀書，只能望着大學之門而興嘆；有錢的少爺小姐把進大學視爲一種裝飾門面的投資。這能不令我們失望嗎？</p>
<p>本來，敎育的目的，在帮助被敎育者作有效的生活上的適應，由個人知能的發展，促成社會不絕的進步，而大學敎育的功能更在陶冶優美的人格，訓練專門的技能。歐美大學的實騐和硏究，往往直接有助於工商業的發展，可說是盡了大學敎育的使命了。</p>
<p>大學的任務，不僅在舊知識的傳授，而應着車於新事物的發現，新文化的創造，最重要的就是供給一個研究學術的方法，作爲發掘文化寳藏的鑰題，同時培養一個完美的生活理想和適應社會的能力。今日大學硏究風氣的淡薄，是無可諱言的事。不要說是在某一知識領域內或某種實用技術上少有獨特的發見和發明，就連系統地整理舊經騐和指導硏究科學的門徑與方法，養成學生適當的生活態度，啟通高尙的人生理想幾方面都未做到令人滿意的地步，這是不得不使我們深感缺憾的。</p>
<p>在「救救大學生」的口號下，在指斥大學生的輿論下，我們不能忽略了今日大學制度本身的缺陷而不設法予以補救。</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3 id="c125">老鼠 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 柏何華</p>
<p>說起來也眞是一種諷刺呢。老鼠是所有的動物中最和人相似的。因爲人和老鼠是僅有的雜食動物。能侵犯人的疾病也　纏繞老鼠。而在從熱帶到兩極的氣候中，他們全能生存。</p>
<p>因爲人和老鼠的食性相同，所以生物學家認爲老鼠是最合理想的實騐的動物。美國賓索法尼亞大學的威斯特解剖生物院有特建的鋼骨建築，畜養健全的純挪威種的白老鼠。</p>
<p>在權威硏究家唐納森博士管理之下，飼養了九十六代白老鼠。他們的食物都經過科學的化騐，和適當的分配；室內的空氣也經過消毒殺菌的手續。同時該院謝絕參觀，以免來賓傳染細菌給老鼠。</p>
<p>他們硏究疲勞狀態下的老鼠性生活；大麻瘋，梅毒，結核病和肺炎過給老鼠的情形；維他命的多少對於生理上的影響；驚慌的老鼠與常態老鼠血壓和循環器官的差異等，動物中除掉人類自身以外，關於老鼠的科學實騐報吿要算最多了。</p>
<p>食物的營養價値也常根據老鼠的實騐而決定的。比如麥考倫敎授研究錳對於人體的影響，就是拿老鼠來試騐的。一種新的藥，漿液，或毒物發明以後，也是用老鼠來決定醫藥上的份量。一隻發育健全的老鼠約重半磅，相當於常人體重的二百五十分之一。從比例上很容易求出相宜的份量來。嗎啡的用途，蛇的毒液等都是先用白老鼠來研究的。</p>
<p>經過了二十二三天的懷孕，小老鼠就生下來了。眼睛閉着，沒有毛，四足未發育，有短尾。僅能啼叫和吸乳。十天以後就會在籠子裏徘徊了。二十五天以後便脫離了父母。之後的發育是很快的？一隻白老鼠通常活三年，比人的發展的快三十倍。威斯特院的九十六代的老鼠約合人類的三千一百年，比有史以來還要長遠些。</p>
<p>老鼠是硏究人類遺傅學最合式的動物。觀察人類三代的情形差不多需要一百年之久；老鼠却在十八個月中吿訴我們同樣的故事。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3 id="c126">兩千年前的毒氣 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 放任</p>
<p>用毒氣做戰爭的利器，大家都以為姑於上次的大戰中。殊不知兩千年前，已有人先用過了。</p>
<p>據古希臘史家蘇瑞達在「南希臘戰爭史」上的記載，紀元前四七〇年斯巴達人圍擊孟加拉城時，便想用烟來燻死那些守城者。他們的方法是把柴束堆放在城坵四週，柴裏漬滿了硫磺和柏油，然後點燃起來，使它產生濃烟。不過這一次他們楚失敗的，因爲風變了方向，烟燻了他們自己，以是不得不却定。</p>
<p>後來，在紀元前四百二十八年，他們又以同樣方法圍攻拍來梯據，這一次他們是成功的。但他們雖因此而克敵，却始終不知道敵軍的死滅，並不單在受了烟燸而是受了硫磺柏油合燃後所生的毒氣——一氧化碳。</p>
<p>斯巴達燒硫磺柏油的方法，在中世紀，大羅馬時代及文藝復興期，也普遍地被人採用，但還是不知道它殺人的眞正原因。他們看着硫磺柏油混合後可在水面燃燒，竟神奇地稱它爲「希臘之火」。</p>
<p>十四世紀時，阿拉伯史家阿白拉嗎（Abramah）也曾有用雅片毒氣摧敵的建議。而在柏林的軍事圖書館中，有一册一四三七年的古籍，裏面就載有製造毒氣彈的方法，在這方劑申，可知它一裏面實含有砒毒三硫化物。</p>
<p>毒氣的歷史，到此便吿一段落。這不是說人類忽然注重人道，大發慈悲，實在地說來，還不是爲了沒有較好的施放方法罷了。因爲距離不遠，自己也同樣有中毒的危險。</p>
<p>十九世紀內，發明漸多。例如法國革命時，法國續軍便據一個叫福克洛的化學師的實騐，使用過一回。拿坡會時代，某英籍化學師也曾把製含靛酸毒氣彈的秘法貢獻給拿氏，但拿氏拒絕不用。一九一二年，海牙列國會議又決定禁止使用毒氣的條例，除了催淚彈因傷害不重故不在此限外，其餘一概禁止。</p>
<p>直到一九一四年的十月終，德軍始違背海牙會議的禁例在萊因使用氯氣，其後聯軍也起而效法。不過在起初都是很薄弱而且屢次失敗的。據統計，在三年半中，德軍共用毒氣四萬七千五百噸，法軍中毒者五十萬零七千人。而美國遠征軍的損失，百分之二十七也是受毒氣之賜。以是毒氣在軍事的地位，便奠定了。</p>
<p>大戰後各國對於毒氣的研究，當然愈加驚人。所幸截至目前爲止，還沒有一國大規模地使用，否則，在這連年的戰爭中，不知又要多添幾百萬新鬼了。</p>

<p>— 金川</p>
<p>我是一個賣稿爲生的窮書生，三年前，借了錢成了親，總算沒有生孩子，担負較輕。但餓一頓，飽一頓，在窮困綫上過日子，眞也不了了之。可是妻子天天嚕囌，長吁短嘆，稍不如意，打架吵嘴，時時有之，這種毛病，惟金錢可醫，於是祇拚命的寫稿，但稿子在今日又不値錢，有時還要打回票，在朋友處借，也祗一回兩回，下次休想開得「尊口」！眞是（終日坎壈纏其身」。但除了吃飯問題外，「住」總算承親戚的情，曬台搭一小屋，每月十元，不算貴，至於「衣」呢，自已在學校時的幾件制服，還可勉强見人，可是妻的衣服非得時時換新不可，長袖的不要穿要短袖的，顏色老樣一點又不要穿，開口不得見人，閉口人家如何如何，眞逼得我叫苦連天了。其次即是頭髮問題，爲了此事，一月必得鬧兩會。　如要去會她的女友的前一天，必又來鬧要燙髮。我說：「頭髮自然的美一。她說，「人家都燙着，不燙，難見人，下面炳生妻，一個做工）的，也燙了，哼，做丈夫的，見妻子蓬頭垢臉的出去，也不知羞。」於是又吵，結果拿了錢去燙了纔了結。歸來，幾天的食糧，換了一頭的圈圈，見了又好笑，又好氣！</p>
<p>所以，在我，妻子的頭髮，倒是個嚴重的問題，假如我不幸（一笑）還有幾個女孩，那可不得了，寫作的稿費，祇可作一月的燙髮之用，肚子要餓起來，說不定爲了頭髮也會成了餓莩，想到此，不寒而慄</p>
<p>在感嘆之餘，我希望一般時髦的小姐奶奶少出些花頭，或者不燙髮，換個不花錢的式樣，也可救救我們穿長衫做苦工死要面子有妻女的人們，則功德無量！</p>

<p>一切知識都從學習中得來，學習愈多，知識愈豐富。反之，一切都無由進步。不進則退，甚至學到的都會失去。由此可知學習之可貴。但，祇知可貴，而不知怎樣學習，則收穫定尠。於是，這裏定出幾個學習的基本原則，請你在學習的過程中把牠們牢牢的記住，這可以帮助你舉習得最多，進步得最快：</p>
<p>第一，要曾搶時間。</p>
<p>第二，要有恒心，有經常性。</p>
<p>第三，要有信心，決心，有頑强的精神。</p>
<p>第四，要虛心。</p>
<p>第五，要有高度的自動心。（移酬孤軍）</p>

<p>現在英國每天所用在戰爭上的余錢約需六百萬英鎊。有一位西門爵士佔計，這一天的費用可作如下的各項用途：</p>
<p>（一）使英國全部失業男女獲得五鎊一天，或一八二五鎊一年。可使退休者每天得養老金二鎊。</p>
<p>（三）可將倫敦郡政廳所負的債款於兩星期中償淸。</p>
<p>（三）這鉅款可使造船廠每天製成三艘巡洋艦。</p>
<p>（四）英國每年的火災損失，可以用此款在一天中完全償付</p>

<h3 id="c130">一個有趣的問題　好萊塢明星是否彼此認識 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 姐妮</p>
<p>你以爲克萊黛考爾會和瑪琳黛德麗是好朋友嗎？或是你相信泰隆鮑華和羅勃泰勒是彼此熟識的麼？</p>
<p>這的確是一個有趣而難以解答的問題。</p>
<p>雖然彼此都是見面用不着介紹的大明星；雖然大家都同處在一個大家庭——好萊塢裏；其實這個大家庭並不是很愉快的，有着種種競爭和失歡，所以明星們彼此不相往來並不足爲奇。</p>
<p>有一次，克勞黛老爾白和徐蘇匹茨（Zassu　Pitts）住在貼隣，歷三年之久，彼此沒有見過一次面和談過一句話。一年後，她們同在派拉蒙當演員，一天偶然在公司碰到了。由相對一笑而拉手，才開始認識起來。</p>
<p>又有一次康絲登本湼和克勞黛老爾白同時在一所醫院的等候室內裏候診。除了在銀幕上見面以外，她倆、素不相識的，因此大家都不敢招呼。後來她們把室中陳列着的電影雜誌取來翻閱，彼此都發現對方的照片實在和對方相像，於是克勞黛鼓起勇氣作一次自我介紹道：</p>
<p>「喂，我是拍電影的，名字是克勞黛。」</p>
<p>「我喚做康絲登，」對方回答。</p>
<p>接着，兩個人都大聲大笑起來，至是她們談得很親熱而起勁，直到醫生喚她們進內。和克勞黛遇見，當女主人替她們彼此介紹過之後，兩個人都想說一句「久仰」可是又覺得難以啟日，於是先談談自己最近所看到的影片，然後克勞黛對瑙瑪說自己很欽佩她，瑙瑪也回一句稱贊克勞黛是一位偉大的藝人。</p>
<p>從上面幾個例子看來，好萊塢的明星們雖然彼此都知道對方的名字，縱使常常見面或是住在近隣，倘若沒有偶然的機綠，恐怕一輩子也不會認識的。</p>

<p>— 林梅先</p>
<p>每到春秋兩季，音樂會在上海成爲最活潑的藝壇動態，口琴團體當然不能例外，大衆口琴會的音樂會前晚在震旦大學大禮堂舉行。</p>
<p>大衆口琴會係口琴家石人望君所領導，他在去年秋間曾開過一次慈善音樂會，頗得好評，這次音樂會，也是慈善性質的，娛樂而不忘救難，我們應對這位從事民衆音樂工作者表示敬意。</p>
<p>前晚的音樂節目，全是大衆口琴會會員所奏出，開頭是「雷夢前奏曲」，大合奏接着的是李銀汀君的口琴獨奏「和來序曲」，和「時代軍官進行曲」大合奏，觀衆似乎對於進行曲甚有好感，表示極大歡迎。</p>
<p>「鴿」和「狂舞曲」由石人望石海　朱榮實蔡其麟等四君以四具手風琴奏出。「輕騎兵」爲世界名曲，現在由龔裕祥唐茲輝兩君以小小的口琴來演奏，很能表現出許多優點，「百合花圓舞曲」也是一支人所熟知的樂曲，演來技術極佳，石海倫小姐的和合琴獨奏，據說還是開中國女子公開演奏和合琴的創舉。她所演奏的是「水手之笛」「維也納森林」一曲，博得極大好評。「大衆口琴會會歌」，係由名曲（惜春歸」所改編，中間加入歌唱，也甚爲別緻。</p>

<p>國際劇人梅蘭芳隱居香島，臉上短髭鬚鬚，似已沒有重上無台之意了，但對藝事還是十分關心。</p>
<p>一天在南粵參觀「打漁殺家」攝製情形，渠對路明所飾蕭桂英一角，認爲具有古時女兒家應有的羞澀端莊的神情，大加讚許。</p>
<p>有人問他對國片的意見，他說最近看過「絕代佳人」，大體上頗爲可取，不過如風聲怒號而塵土不飛等處，似尙欠缺，同時還說出許多導演上的技術問題，誰料對電影倒也相當內行。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳收王熙春爲徒事，已在淺水灣飯店舉行，梅對人說：「熙春身段做工，雖未臻化境，但還沒有惡習氣，嗓子固狹，可是並非無法改善。」現熙春每日午後五時許赴梅寓吊嗓。按梅氏收女弟子，以熙春爲第一人，梅妻福芝芳在平時雖亦曾受梅指導，但不久即歸梅了。</p>

<p>馬連良臨潼山之方靠旗　（中）</p>
<p>凡新發明之物，第一須有意養，戲劇爲美的藝術，故新剏之服裝於意義之外。猶須顧到美觀與便利兩點。連良本不學無術，左右逢迎者又祇圖以新奇取悅觀衆，於是此不倫不類之龍虎靠與四方靠旗，乃得在「臨潼山」劇中出現。殊不知中國戲劇原以「象徵的」而爲舉世所稱道，若事事物物務求逼眞，則先已喪失中劇之價値。譬如武將所着之盔甲，本爲鐵革所製，乃附身禦敵之具也，甲係三屬連綴而成，上如披肩者，謂之披膊，中綴於當胸者，曰胸鎧，下垂於兩旁者，曰腿裙，雖均以鐵葉綴成，然重量亦有四五十斤。戲劇中依形仿製，緞質而飾以錦繡，復取曰靠，除腿裙（內行呼此曰靠牌子）外，上中皆連成一氣，而靠肚（即中部稱爲胸鎧者）之下部，又較眞者加長，純取輕便而美觀之意，若眞以鐵葉綴成，吾恐雖膂力過人之兪潤仙，亦難能於長板坡」中顯其好身手矣。又靠有輭硬之分，硬靠背後有皮座可挿靠旗四面，輭靠則無之，老靠旗之用意，乃緣於將帥馬上作戰時，可任取令旗一面，以作發號施令之信物，數固不必爲四，形亦不必正方，早歲吾嘗見梆子班有用八扇靠旗者，後海上武生夏月潤亦曾一度用之，惟終覺累贅而不雅觀，故許多年來仍以三角式之四面靠旗爲伶界所一致採用也。</p>

They also found two Han tombs, which seemed to be the burial place for a couple. Guo and Wei took three bricks back to Chongqing and plan to unite with archaeologists in Chongqing to organize an archaeological team to carry out excavations. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Is the Second Phase of the European War Beginning? <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Although there have been repeated rumors that a major battle on the Western Front in the European war is about to break out, so far, both sides' strategies have been to "hold firm as the best form of offense." All efforts have been focused on how to win over neutral countries, and how to carry out economic blockades and counter-blockades; in short, how to defend in order to weaken the other side. However, although the military confrontation is only visible in the heavily fortified Western Front, the diplomatic and economic offensives have spread throughout Europe, even beyond Europe, with tentacles reaching far into the entire world. After a period of seven months, the diplomatic and economic wars can be said to have reached a fever pitch. In Europe, from the Scandinavian countries in the north to the Balkan countries in the south, although the sounds of gunfire are not heard in those countries, and they are still able to maintain their neutral status on the surface, the major powers in the conflict have not let them go, making their situation increasingly difficult. The drifting smell of gunpowder may trigger their powder kegs at any time. Their subjective "neutrality" will soon lose its complete neutrality objectively as the economic offensive of the belligerent countries unfolds. Recently, at such a turning point in the situation, British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill said in a broadcast speech on March 31: "The war is about to become more intense, but no matter what, we will never be discouraged. We know that the people of France and Britain must make their greatest efforts in the future." Churchill did not specify what kind of war he meant by "the war is about to become more intense." However, according to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on April 2, the Allies are determined to strengthen various blockade policies; and the British government will do its best to cut off the supply of Scandinavian iron to Germany, and warn neutral countries against helping Germany; this is tantamount to implying that if neutral countries help Germany, they will suffer a terrible fate. This declaration is by no means an empty threat. What has already been seen in the facts are: (1) A note to Norway, informing them that the Allies will implement a tighter blockade, prohibiting any ships from carrying wartime contraband through Norwegian territorial waters; and that mines have been laid in certain areas of Norwegian territorial waters. (2) French blockade chief Monnet and British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross held talks on strengthening the blockade, making important technical decisions. (3) British Foreign Secretary Halifax summoned envoys stationed in the Balkan countries back home to give instructions; and began negotiations with envoys from the Balkan countries stationed in Britain, in order to make the trade of the Balkan countries lean towards Britain and France, and transfer the various materials originally supplied to Germany to Britain and France. With its decisive and vigorous posture, and its policy of combining grace and power, the main purpose is to seize neutral countries and make Germany unable to obtain raw materials economically and collapse on its own. Under this "tightening," Norway bears the brunt, and declared last night that it opposes the measures of Britain and France, and at the same time lays mines in its territorial waters to maintain its neutrality. Before we know its nature in detail, it can be regarded as Norway's proper and fair self-defense measures; but in fact, what is the difference from participating in the blockade against Germany? This is a subtle phenomenon, and to know the consequences, we must look to the future!</p>
<p>As for the Balkan countries, sandwiched between Germany and Italy, it is difficult for them to get rid of the intrusion of German economic power. Although Britain and France want to provide assistance to these countries "when Germany violates the rights of neutral countries," there is a considerable distance in space and time between Britain and France and the Balkans, and in the actions of Britain and France towards the Balkans. This is indeed a difficult factual problem. Since the Balkan countries have the lessons of Poland and Czechoslovakia, no matter how sympathetic they are to Britain and France, they may not have the courage to immediately change course in response to Britain and France's declared determination to strengthen the blockade, given Germany's economic demands. From this, we can speculate that the achievements that British and French policy can expect in the Balkans, at least, are not immediate. The European war originally had two possible developments. As of today, it is a natural conclusion that the flames of the European war will first spread to the Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war last year, British warships penetrated into the east of the Shetland Islands at the mouth of the Baltic Sea, which demonstrated one aspect of the British naval strategy. Originally, in terms of the number of naval vessels, according to statistics at the end of September 1938, the United Kingdom alone had a total of 301 warships of all classes, while Germany had only 65, a ratio of almost five to one, a huge difference. British ships totaled over 1.3 million tons, while German ships totaled 135,000 tons, a ratio of almost ten to one, an even greater difference. Such a disparity in strength is a fact as solid as steel. Now, for the sake of the Scandinavian Peninsula, that is, for the sake of Norway's neutral status, Britain and Germany will engage in close combat in this area. In this area, all diplomatic, political, and economic wars, as well as so-called propaganda or nerve wars, have been put aside at this stage, and the navy is the only main force. We cannot imagine Germany making a desperate naval battle with Britain in this area, but imagine Britain's strict blockade in this area. The success of the blockade should be no problem.</p>
<p>The European war has been going on for seven months now; and this time, with Norway as the center of the issue, it will develop into the beginning of the second phase of the European war!</p>

<p>Chongqing – The Fifth Session of the National Political Council saw the Third and Fifth Committee Groups complete their proposal reviews on the 7th.

The Seventh Session was held at 3:00 PM today, attended by Vice-Speaker Zhang Boling, Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and 141 councilors including Ma Chengfeng, as well as over ten heads of various agencies, including Yu Youren, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Lifu, Weng Wenhao, and Zhou Zhongyue. Vice-Speaker Zhang chaired the meeting. After the formalities, the minutes of the Sixth Session were read. Then, the proposals reviewed by the groups and temporary motions were discussed. Except for those retained, a total of 36 proposals were passed. Key ones include: (1) Councilor Chu Fucheng and 30 others proposed that the government intensify opium prohibition and unify national anti-narcotics agencies to achieve practical results. It was resolved to revise and pass the proposal and submit it to the government for consideration. (2) Councilor Li Yuanding and 27 others proposed that the government establish county councils as soon as possible. It was resolved to forward the proposal to the government for prompt action.

If a reply to the correction has not been received, the original attendees should be asked to send another letter to correct it and publish the corrected letter." (11) Councilor Hu Shiqing and 55 others proposed that the government clearly explain the meaning of "territorial integrity" to encourage morale and benefit resistance. It was resolved, in essence, as follows: "This council believes that the meaning of territorial integrity refers to the entire territory of the Republic of China and is undoubtedly clear. As for the conclusion of a certain gentleman at the Pacific Science Congress, it is indeed absurd. A correction method has been decided based on Councilor Hu Jingyi's proposal. In addition, it is hoped that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will at any time instruct overseas embassies and consulates and personnel going abroad for propaganda or attending international conferences to pay attention." (12) Councilor Wang Yaming and 21 others proposed strengthening the implementation of the new county system. It was resolved to submit the proposal to the government for adoption and implementation.

It was resolved to revise and pass the proposal. (14) Councilor Shi Liang and 28 others proposed that the government pay attention to employing women as much as possible in public positions that women can serve. It was resolved to submit the proposal to the government for consideration. (15) Councilor Wang Liming and 22 others proposed that the central government quickly form a women's production enterprise promotion committee to strengthen the wartime economy. It was resolved to request the government to adopt and implement the proposal. (16) Councilor Wu Zhimei and 31 others proposed that the government issue an order to all provinces to earnestly promote women's hand spinning and weaving industries to facilitate timely production. It was resolved to pass the proposal and request the government to adopt and implement it. (17) Councilor Fu Sinian and 24 others proposed that since Shandong Province suffered from repeated floods, droughts, windstorms, hail, and locust plagues last year, the disaster situation was severe, and the people were struggling to survive, it was proposed that the government quickly allocate a large sum of money for relief efforts. It was resolved to revise and pass the proposal and submit it to the government for quick and earnest action.

In addition, Councilor Han Kewen and 49 others submitted a temporary motion as follows: "In the recent Battle of Suiyuan, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fu and his officers and soldiers fought hard for more than a month and were finally able to recover the lost territory, making the belief in the inevitable victory of the resistance war more firm and consolidating the foundation for the success of the resistance war. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a personal order to commend and issue a special reward of 300,000 yuan, which proves their outstanding achievements are worthy of praise. At the time of the Fifth Session of this council, it is proposed that a telegram be sent in the name of the General Assembly to congratulate on the victory and express appreciation."

<p>The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are increasingly united</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to well-informed sources, the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is expected to be completely eliminated immediately with the arrival of Communist leader Zhou Enlai in Chongqing. Strict cooperation between the two parties is expected to be realized immediately. The discussions between the Kuomintang and Communist councilors in the National Political Council have laid a foundation for final consultations. These final consultations will begin upon Zhou Enlai's arrival in Chongqing. Mr. Zhou is currently in Yan'an and is expected to fly here within a few days. Mr. Zhou's arrival here is a sign that the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been completely eliminated, as Mr. Zhou's mission in the past three years and now has been to strive for the unity and cooperation of the two parties. On April 4, Communist leaders Lin Zuhan, Tai Bangxian, and Zhou Enlai's wife came here to participate in the National Political Council meeting. The meeting discussed three major issues: drafting a constitution, Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, and stabilizing prices. As all councilors have the sincerity to resolve the issues, the results of the discussions were very satisfactory. (Eighth Dispatch, United Press)</p>

<p>Tokyo – 6,283 Japanese elementary and middle school students answered questions from the Japanese Anti-Communist Friendship Association. Seventy percent supported Germany's victory, only twelve percent supported democracy, and the remaining eleven percent did not care who won. From the results of this survey, it can be seen that most Japanese children believe that Germany was forced to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union in order to avoid being constrained so that it could deal with Britain with all its strength. However, they still harbor hostility towards the Soviet Union and believe that Germany will eventually regret colluding with the Soviet Union. In addition, more than eighty percent of Japanese children believe that Britain and France have lost prestige over the Tianjin and Asama Maru incidents. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Britain and France Officially Announce Laying of Mines in Norwegian Waters; Tensions in Northern Europe, War Imminent; Norway Protests Severely, Demands Removal <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>London – The three areas of Norwegian territorial waters mentioned in the British and French government communiqué this morning where mines have been laid are all very important areas close to the coast, not large in area, each controlling a bay, a harbor, the most important of which is near Bodo, controlling the entrance to the West Bay and the port of Narvik in the Arctic Ocean, where Germany ships out Swedish iron ore. These two mine-laying locations are both north of the main European shipping routes, and the southernmost one is at Stetland at the entrance to the North Bay, 110 miles north of Bergen. The third area is about 120 miles northeast of Stetland, near Kristiansund between that location and Narvik. According to Reuters, the minefields in Norwegian territorial waters have been successfully completed by British and French fleets in cooperation at dawn. According to responsible sources, these minefields are specifically aimed at Germany and have nothing to do with neutral countries. It is expected that the trade in iron ore between Narvik and Germany, even if not completely halted, will be severely hit. However, it is reported that the purpose of laying the mines is to deal with other trades, not limited to iron ore. Britain has received information that German ships often sail through territorial waters to evade British contraband zones and control zones, and German attacks also sneak out to sea in the same way. It is generally hoped that today's mine-laying action will prevent the recurrence of the above situations. Responsible sources also pointed out that the actions of the Allied countries are beneficial to all neutral countries, just like Britain and France. Although the Allied countries' mine-laying this time will be criticized as irregular and violating neutrality regulations, neutrality regulations must be respected by both parties to be effective. If one party often ignores them, it cannot be solely responsible for other parties to abide by them. Germany has almost destroyed all international law clauses that it can destroy, except for those adopted by the Allied countries today, because it is unable to destroy them. The Allied countries have no intention of expanding the war zone, but if Germany takes any action against Scandinavia, it will inevitably cause a severe reaction. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>Copenhagen – The Scandinavian countries are increasingly terrified of the current situation, believing that even if they try their best to maintain neutrality, they will inevitably be dragged into the vortex of war due to the pressure of the great powers. News from London, Berlin, and Scandinavian capitals has caused newspapers to publish on their front pages records that the Scandinavian countries may be spared from war due to the peace between the Soviet Union and Finland. However, the current situation is making the Nordic countries more fearful than the consequences they had imagined from the previous British and French intervention in Finland.

Otherwise, our government will take all appropriate measures to deal with them. (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>Copenhagen – The "Berlingske Tidende" reports from Oslo that Norwegian Prime Minister Nygaardsvold met with Foreign Minister Koht this morning. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Norwegian Parliament held an extraordinary meeting at 10:00 this morning. According to the Scandinavian Telegraph Bureau, the British ambassador to Norway, Mr. Dormer, and the French ambassador, Mr. Baelen, visited the Norwegian Foreign Ministry at 7:00 this morning. (Eighth Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris – The British and French governments jointly submitted a note to the Norwegian government on the 5th of this month, which stated that Germany's actions in Norwegian territorial waters are sufficient to harm the interests of Britain and France, and it is no longer appropriate to tolerate them. Therefore, they declared their right to take necessary measures to avoid letting Germany have the convenience of obtaining resources in Norway and decided that any ship carrying wartime contraband would not be allowed to pass freely through Norwegian territorial waters. For this reason, mines have been laid in the areas of Statlandet, Bud, and Vestfjord in the country's territorial waters. In the future, any ship that enters these areas will bear all risks. However, British and French warships will patrol outside the territorial waters of these areas within 48 hours after laying the first batch of mines and issue warnings via radio to ensure the safety of maritime navigation. In addition, the British and French governments also jointly issued a statement and broadcast it via radio, stating that in recent weeks, German attacks on merchant ships of various countries have increased and their brutality has increased day by day. More than 150 ships of neutral countries have been sunk by Germany, and about 1,000 people of neutral countries have died as a result. The German side has even violated the universally recognized rules of war by attacking fishing boats and lightships to exert its terror tactics. On the other hand, Britain and France have never destroyed or damaged ships of neutral countries, nor have they killed people of neutral countries. Not only that, but they have also rescued many lives and innocent people who have been harmed by Germany, even German pilots and submarine crew members who have committed inhumane acts have been rescued by Britain and France from drowning. The actions of the two sides are as different as heaven and earth. The International Convention recognizes that belligerent countries have the right to take appropriate measures to deal with it when the enemy deliberately takes illegal actions. Therefore, the British and French governments believe that they have the right to take all actions deemed appropriate to deal with the current situation. As for the losses suffered by neutral countries' shipping, Norway accounts for the largest part. At this time, the German government is still demanding that the Norwegian government allow it to freely use Norwegian territorial waters to facilitate German commerce. The Norwegian government believes that it is forced to send warships to escort German ships within territorial waters. It is known that under German pressure, whatever policy Norway adopts to form the current situation is something that Britain and France cannot tolerate for long, that is, they cannot allow Germany to obtain convenience from Norway and obtain the main resources necessary for combat, thereby placing Britain and France in a dangerous and unfavorable position. Norway has been notified that it declares its right to take all necessary measures, as it is necessary for the victory of the war. It is believed that world public opinion will be able to understand its motives and the difficulties of having to do something. In short, the goal of Britain and France is to ensure that the various principles on which the survival of the small countries of Europe depends are implemented. As for the mines placed in Norwegian territorial waters, they are not enough to hinder Norwegians and Norwegian ships from freely entering and leaving the coastal ports of that country.

<p>New York – The Republican "New York Volkszeitung" praised the decision of Britain and France to take various measures against neutral countries to intensify the blockade of Germany, stating, "Only after Germany is defeated will there be hope for the revival of international law. Britain and France, in order to achieve victory, no longer abide by the international law that Germany has repeatedly violated. While it is regrettable, if this method is the only way to win, then those who truly support international law should not criticize Britain and France for doing so." (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Neutral Countries' Attitudes Closely Watched by Germany; If They Acquiesce to Blockade, Retaliation Will Be Implemented; German Foreign Minister Invites Norwegian and Swedish Ambassadors for Meeting <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Amsterdam – It is reported that German political circles are greatly alarmed by Britain's intensified activities against neutral countries. The government is concentrating on studying news and plans regarding the new situation, and German newspapers are full of articles with angry and scathing words criticizing Britain, pointing out that Britain's notes to Norway and Sweden are undoubtedly a threat and a diplomatic prelude to a major war. The German government expects that Germany will not have immediate confrontational actions. At present, it is only closely watching the attitudes of neutral countries. Many observers believe that the next scene in the war will be the entire turmoil in the Scandinavian Peninsula. German Nazi spokesmen have now warned all neutral countries, "Acquiescing to the blockade is tantamount to aiding the Allied countries." This is the gist of Germany's reaction after the Netherlands promulgated an order implementing the new Dutch-British trade agreement. Semi-official German sources said that the sudden announcement of the Dutch-British trade agreement was regrettable because Germany did not have time to study it carefully. However, the extent to which the Netherlands, as a neutral transportation country for Germany, has abandoned its rights and obligations is something that Germany must consider. Yesterday, Germany used newspapers and radio propaganda to tell neutral countries that Britain was recklessly implementing its evil schemes to harm Germany. However, neutral countries are now aware that the crisis lies not in the British plan itself, but in Germany's retaliation against those it believes are succumbing to the British plan.

A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that the German government believes that Britain and France intend to take action in the direction of Norway, so it is closely monitoring the situation. "The goal of Britain and France is to prevent iron ore from being transported to our country, but this is in Germany's interest, and we should naturally rise up to defend it." (Seventh Dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland – Swiss newspapers published a dispatch from their Berlin correspondent stating that Britain and France's active diplomatic activities and the joint submission of notes to Norway and Sweden have caused a strong impression in Berlin. The correspondent of the Basler Nachrichten said that according to the German authorities, Britain and France will lay mines inside and outside the territorial waters of Norway so that German ships carrying Swedish iron ore cannot sail back to their country via the Norwegian Sea. In addition, the German Foreign Ministry seems to be dissatisfied with the attitude of the Scandinavian newspapers when commenting on the British and French notes, pointing out that it is too passive and does not conform to Germany's ideal of neutrality, and said that these countries are in danger of inviting war, at which time Britain and France will be unable to protect them even if they want to. (Seventh Dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark – "Nationaltidende" quoted a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the position of the Scandinavian countries may undergo drastic changes. People in Germany generally believe that the neutrality of Norway and Sweden no longer exists. Britain and France will immediately take military action against these countries. On the German side, they do not want to allow Britain and France to strike first and are preparing to launch a sudden attack. However, these people only mentioned Sweden and Norway and did not involve Denmark, which is noteworthy. (Eighth Dispatch, Havas)</p>

<p>Stockholm - Following the news that Britain and France have laid mines in Norwegian waters, Swedish political circles are shocked, recognizing that the current situation is extremely delicate and believing that the maintenance of Nordic neutrality will be seriously threatened in the future. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - The Allied countries' laying of mines in Norwegian territorial waters is regarded by Swedish official circles as a violent violation of neutrality. No condemnation of this action is too severe. Leading articles in the local newspapers continue to speculate on the nature of the British note. Well-informed sources believe that its content is a warning that Scandinavia has been too easily subdued by German threats. The *Tidningen* reports that the British note is the first action in the Allied spring offensive, which has now expanded to the Balkans. At the same time, according to the Swedish Minister of Defense, as a result of the current situation, Sweden's neutral guard has been intensified. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

German authorities issue entry passports only in special circumstances. German women who marry Dutch men are not allowed to return home to visit their families, even to inquire about illness. A small number of Dutch workers operating in Germany are under close surveillance, and their time and reason for entering Germany must be investigated. According to observers, this measure by the German authorities is intended to prevent espionage. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>London - It has been officially announced that British envoys to the Balkan Peninsula will hold a meeting at the Foreign Office at 4:00 PM today, chaired by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. Those attending will include the British Ambassadors to the Soviet Union and Turkey, as well as the Ministers to Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.

<p>London - Responsible figures here recently stated that British envoys to Southeastern European countries are scheduled to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax twice, at 4:00 PM on the 8th and 3:00 PM on the 9th, for discussions, and then meet with the Minister of Economic Warfare, Mr. Cross. If necessary, they will also be received by Prime Minister Chamberlain. British Ambassador to Italy Sir Noel Charles and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir William Seeds (who has been on leave in the UK since January and has not yet returned to his post) will also participate in the discussions. According to political observers, this move is related to the various operational plans decided upon at the recent joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France, and is another launch of intensified economic warfare against Germany by the respective countries. It is noted that French Minister of Blockade Monnet consulted with British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross on intensifying blockade measures during his recent visit here. The British and French governments then jointly presented notes to Sweden and Norway. The economic and diplomatic offensive of Britain and France was indeed initiated with these two events. Whether the content of this note will be made public depends on the attitude of Sweden and Norway, but it has been clearly stated in this note that Britain and France have the right to take appropriate and effective measures to deal with certain German activities. The government authorities should brief the envoys to Southeastern European countries on all of this,</p>

Twenty-four British bombers were discovered north of Sylt Island. German fighters shot down two British aircraft, and the remaining British aircraft fled westward. Multiple air battles occurred over the Western Front, with German fighters shooting down four enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft batteries shooting down one enemy aircraft.

<p>Paris - The French Army communiqué stated that air activity was very frequent yesterday, and five enemy aircraft were shot down, one of which was shot down by the British Air Force. There was also some artillery fire west of the Vosges Mountains. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - Reuters correspondent with the French Army reports that activity on the Western Front has clearly increased in the past two or three weeks. However, it remains to be seen whether this is a prelude to more intense action. Artillery battles at the western end of the front line have intensified, with three or four times more shells fired than a month ago. Observation posts, roads, and even villages between the two armies that had previously escaped destruction have now been subjected to relentless artillery fire. The work of the sappers is often hindered, so their actions are more cautious than before. A common phenomenon on all sections of the front is that attempts by both sides' patrols to capture enemy soldiers for intelligence have become increasingly determined, and therefore encounters are becoming more intense. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - It is reported that the number of troops concentrated in various German regions has increased. France is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude. According to well-informed sources, it is difficult to say whether the large number of German troops concentrated is intended to intimidate, or whether they intend to land on the coasts of Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

<p>Bern - The *Neue Zürcher Zeitung* of Zurich published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that a slogan is currently popular in Berlin: "Paris will fall in the first half of June this year, and a peace treaty can be signed on July 1." In reality, this is part of a "nerve war," and the panic and confusion of German public opinion can be seen from this. As the German authorities are currently stepping up military preparations and continuing to conscript soldiers, civilian life is being affected. The atmosphere in Berlin can be summarized as depressing and tense. The authorities, aware of the anxiety of the people, are issuing the above slogan to reassure them. Alternatively, Germany, due to the imminent intensification of the blockade by Britain and France, may be planning to take military action to retaliate, so they are preparing public opinion. It is also possible. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

Yesterday, the Yugoslav Prime Minister visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to discuss the possibility of this matter. Recent reports from Belgrade indicate that Britain may attempt to blockade the Adriatic Sea in the near future.

<p>Belgrade - Well-informed sources here say that the Ministry of the Army will join with relevant departments to form a joint committee to discuss export restriction plans, in order to ensure the economic prosperity of the country and national defense strength. The supply of livestock produced in Yugoslavia already falls short of demand, and the domestic industrial need for certain raw materials is particularly urgent. It is not appropriate to further sacrifice oneself to benefit others. After the establishment of this joint committee, the first task will be to find ways to restore export trade to pre-war levels, and then gradually reduce it. In this regard, when the Yugoslav economic delegation holds negotiations with the Italian delegation in Fiume tomorrow, it will propose reducing the amount of livestock exported from Yugoslavia to Italy. In addition, Yugoslavia's current barter agreement with Germany is not expected to be extended after it expires at the end of this month. If this is the case, Germany will suffer a major blow. According to the method agreed upon by both sides last autumn, Yugoslavia must sell 10,000 carloads of wheat, 2,500 carloads of flour, 45,000 tons of vegetable oil, 300,000 pigs, and a large amount of raw materials and metal products to Germany each year. From now on, Yugoslavia is determined to demand the cancellation of this limit, and to halve the amount of German goods imported into Yugoslavia, even if Germany applies pressure.

The quota for meat, milk, eggs, and leather will also be based on the total area of grassland and pasture owned by the collective farm, and no longer on the number of livestock. The Soviet government hopes that after the implementation of this quota system, the number of livestock can be increased. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Last winter, Japan experienced a coal shortage. The reason for this was that automobiles and buses were using charcoal as fuel. In addition, the general public, influenced by the electricity conservation movement, had returned to the ancient practice of using "hibachi" for heating, resulting in a sharp increase in charcoal consumption. In view of this, the Japanese Youth Association launched a charcoal collection campaign, calling on the entire country to participate. The authorities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education also provided encouragement and guidance, and subsidized various equipment. As a result, 2,511,399 youth members and 1,268,901 students responded, collecting a total of 14 million bundles of charcoal, each bundle weighing eight pounds, totaling 42,000 tons. This was distributed to the families of soldiers stationed in China and to public institutions. The remainder was supplied to areas lacking charcoal. During this charcoal collection campaign, youth groups climbed mountains and entered forests, enduring hardships and facing accidents, resulting in the deaths of three young people.

<p>London - In response to reporters' questions today, Eden informed reporters that plans to train aircraft pilots and aviation experts in Canada, with the ability to successfully train 50,000 people each year, will soon be realized. Eden outlined this plan with a calm and confident attitude, and his words were almost unbelievable, as the purpose of the plan he described was to provide Britain and France with a steady stream of skilled pilots, in numbers that far exceeded common imagination. According to the air force training program under this plan, after all preparations are completed, 1,000 fully trained pilots will be successfully trained each week. According to Eden, most of these pilots are trained at Canadian aviation schools, with an expected 50,000 graduates each year. This does not include those trained in Great Britain and Ireland, or in Australia and New Zealand. Eden also said that the ways in which the Dominions are helping Britain to "win" are surprisingly numerous. The above-mentioned plan is just one example. In other aspects, such as manpower, food, raw materials, and money, are also flowing into Britain from the various Dominions. In Australia, for example, 90,000 soldiers are currently in training, and it has been announced that a complete Australian corps will be formed and sent to serve in Britain. The Australian division trained in Palestine may be combined with the 2nd Infantry Division. New Zealand plans to train thousands of new troops to expand its garrison in Egypt to a sufficiently strong level. As for Canada, in addition to training the air force, it also plans to form a complete corps. The 1st Infantry Division is currently undergoing advanced training in Britain and will soon be completed. The Union of South Africa is currently preparing to defend Africa south of the equator. The military expenses of each Dominion are entirely borne by the respective Dominions. Not only that, but all the Dominions are also working closely with Great Britain to implement an effective double blockade policy against Germany, that is, on the one hand, refusing to accept German exports, and on the other hand, closely monitoring to prevent raw materials from being transported to Germany. For example, the Dominions are also seeking to stabilize the exchange rate of the pound. However, what Eden is most excited about is the Canadian air force training plan. Eden believes that the importance of this plan cannot be fully understood, and says that its spiritual impact on Germany is comparable to the entry of the United States in the last Great War.

After the aircraft are completed, some may be flown across the Atlantic by pilots to Britain for use, but most will be dismantled, transported to Britain, and assembled within a week. All of these aircraft will be equipped with British-made machine guns, as they are of better quality than those made in the United States. According to Colonel Johnson, the Assistant Secretary of the Army, US aircraft factories can manufacture as many as 17,500 aircraft per year, which is unmatched by any other country.

<p>Berlin - The "People's Observer" commented on the issue of mandated territories, stating that representatives from the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, and Belgium on the League of Nations Mandates Commission are very concerned about the Allied powers' manipulation of mandated territories. These neutral countries participate in the administration of mandated territories, and if the mandated territories also participate in the war against Germany, the neutral countries participating in the administration also bear responsibility. For example, Tanganyika increasing import taxes on alcohol to cover British military expenses violates the regulations of mandated territories, and the neutral countries on the Mandates Commission should also bear some responsibility. These neutral countries should also inquire about which country's forces Southwest Africa is raising an army to fight against. All of these are signs of illegal actions by the Allied powers.

<h3 id="e60">Sunspot Problem: Talk by Professor Martin of Seoul University <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - Professor Martin of Seoul University in Korea recently published a talk in the Japanese newspaper Huibunho on the problem of sunspots, stating that there are currently six major sunspots on the surface of the sun. Recently, radio stations around the world have experienced significant disturbances, and the reason for this is that, as early as two months ago, two days after the first earthquake in Turkey, he personally observed two major sunspots on the surface of the sun in southern Korea. This is related to the earthquake in Turkey and is not a coincidence. He had also studied sunspots before the great Tokyo earthquake in the past. At that time, there was an extremely large sunspot at 22 degrees south of the solar equator, and he immediately predicted that an earthquake was likely to occur, which was later confirmed. According to the results of experiments conducted by German astronomer Schwabe at the Tesuo City Observatory in 1851, sunspots reach their maximum point every eleven years, and an examination of medical history and past newspapers reveals a great relationship between sunspots and human epidemics. The following facts have also been proven to be true: (1) Several types of epidemics often spread from the east to the west of the earth; (2) From the Black Death in 1536 to the so-called "Spanish flu" in 1918, epidemics occurred repeatedly in between, with intervals that coincided with the eleven-year cycle of sunspots; (3) Some microorganisms that are normally harmless become toxic due to the influence of the electromagnetic force of sunspots. In addition, during periods of sunspot appearance, the mortality rate on Earth increases, and patients' body temperature rises and pulse accelerates, often leading to death even if the symptoms are not severe. In short, the area of each sunspot is hundreds of times larger than the Earth, and its electromagnetic force is truly astonishing. Unfortunately, the scientific community still has limited knowledge of its true nature. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3 id="e61">Marriage is a Reproductive Union <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Therefore, attention should be paid to reproductive hygiene.</p>
<p>The hygiene of married life not only affects the happiness of individuals, but also has a close relationship with the wife and the entire family organization. Therefore, if one only begins to study hygiene after marriage, it is like digging a well when one is already thirsty. Therefore, one should pay attention to oneself before marriage. Originally, the union of husband and wife is entirely based on reproductive desires. If sexual relations are removed, there is no such thing as husband and wife. The ancients said: There is no closer relationship than that between father and son, and no more intimate relationship than that between husband and wife. In fact, although father and son belong to the natural order, their affection is far less than that of husband and wife. Those who are more affectionate to their wives than to their parents account for nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand. Those who can stand alone and be more affectionate to their wives than to their parents account for less than one out of a thousand. Is it that the love of the natural order is not as good as the love of husband and wife? One only has natural affection, while the other contains sexual relations. Therefore, sexual relations are the only tool for uniting the love of husband and wife, and also the important point of attention for hygiene after marriage. If the husband and wife have no illness and can cooperate with each other in reproductive function, then they will love each other. Even if there are differences of opinion, they can always understand each other. This is what should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>As for the hygiene methods of reproductive function, even doctors cannot know everything. To discuss these facts, we must first have a simple description of sexual diseases. Among those most easily contracted after marriage, premature ejaculation is the most common. People who frequently have nocturnal emissions before marriage almost all find it difficult to avoid. Premature ejaculation is caused by dissipated energy, which is the act of ejaculating. Therefore, it easily causes conflicts in love. However, those who suffer from this can use youth gland endocrine therapy to completely cure it. If left untreated, the symptoms will become increasingly dangerous, extending to the whole body, such as pale complexion, thin muscles, throbbing headaches, mental fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, and infertility after marriage. Among the best youth gland hormone preparations on the market, the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Butt Kang", is the first choice. After taking it, premature ejaculation is eliminated, physical strength is restored, brain power is stimulated, metabolic function is promoted, muscles are strengthened, and complexion is ruddy. The potency of the drug is thorough, and it generates sperm and tonifies the kidneys in just four hours. The famous British doctor Dr. Stoke has been actively using this drug for many years. According to his words, the ingredients of "Butt Kang" do not contain impurities and do not irritate the stomach. Therefore, its efficacy is difficult for other tonics to match. Therefore, this product is the best medicine for those who are weak after marriage.</p>
<h3 id="e62">From Theory to Experiment: A New Method for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— American Doctor of Medicine Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Today, when speaking of gonorrhea treatment, empty talk is not enough to convince people. Ordinary preparations are also unable to achieve results. If one only speaks of drug efficacy, one is bound to exaggerate. All of this is not the attitude of a scholar. Therefore, I do not adopt this approach. However, since I went to the United States to study, I have also devoted myself to the study of gonorrhea treatment. Using new scientific methods and corroborating them with my internship at the American Venereal Disease Hospital, the path to treating gonorrhea is mutually corroborated. According to my investigation, gonorrhea must have systemic anti-gonorrheal treatment to avoid leaving out any omissions. Because with this efficacy, it can energize every cell in the tissues of the human body to carry out its function of eliminating gonococci. Therefore, whether gonorrhea is new or old, such as local urethral gonorrhea, chronic prostatitis and orchitis, female vulvar gonorrhea, uterine inflammation, and gonorrheal leucorrhea, not only can they be cured quickly, but also systemic infections such as conjunctivitis, endocarditis, and arthritis can be quickly and completely cured.</p>
<p>Systemic anti-gonorrheal treatment is indeed the most thorough and ideal theory for completely curing all types of leucorrhea. Later, Dr. Peter of Germany adopted the strengths of many and diligently researched and invented the drug "Kelinnong." Its ingredients are made from specially made proteins, yellow pigments, and other ingredients. Therefore, taking it can energize cells and resist the phagocytic action of gonococci. Therefore, I had already admired and used this drug in the United States, and the directors of the gonorrhea departments in hospitals in the United States unanimously praised the miraculous efficacy of "Kelinnong." In acute gonorrhea, the efficacy can be seen within one or two weeks of taking this drug? Moreover, it can be eradicated in this short period. In chronic gonorrhea, it can also be eradicated in four or five courses of treatment. In terms of external medicine, the drug "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is also excellent as a urethral wash.

<h3 id="e63">Coughing and Hemoptysis <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that people with a phthisic constitution have unusually fragile lungs, which really cannot withstand any kind of vibration. During this vibration, the capillaries in the lungs rupture and bleed. This kind of vibration that causes the lungs to be affected is no greater than coughing. Therefore, coughing and hemoptysis have a close relationship. This is a very obvious matter. To prevent hemoptysis, one must first suppress the cough. Only the drug "Bufei Naer" can calm the cough within three hours. Therefore, taking this drug when warming up can prevent pulmonary hemorrhage. This is the correct result of my twenty years of experience.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Gonorrhea Lecture: A Discussion of the Comprehensive Treatment of Gonorrhea <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Outline of Gonorrhea Treatment</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is inherently a difficult venereal disease to treat. This is because the causative agent of gonorrhea—the gonococcus—possesses an extremely tenacious and combative ability. It can also hide in deep and obscure locations. Therefore, to use a certain method to eliminate gonococci, it is best to do so in the acute stage. However, it is not to say that once acute gonorrhea has passed, chronic leucorrhea cannot be treated. The practical aspect of treating gonorrhea is how to prevent the gonococci from penetrating deep inside. Once they have penetrated deep inside, how can they be quickly eradicated to cut off their reproduction and create a desperate struggle? To consume the patient's physical strength.</p>
<p>Discussion of Treatment Methods</p>
<p>The key to gonorrhea treatment lies in eliminating gonococci. However, the location of the gonococci must be determined through precise scientific diagnostic methods. Therefore, doctors should not rely on "an old horse knows the way" and abundant experience when diagnosing gonorrhea. A doctor's experience is certainly necessary, but it is still necessary to carefully examine the patient and then prescribe the appropriate medicine. It is especially important to adopt the strengths of various treatment methods and avoid their weaknesses. If one insists on using a certain treatment method for a disease from beginning to end, one is bound to be biased. I have treated gonorrhea for more than ten years and know the advantages and disadvantages of this.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Treatment</p>
<p>Because gonococci can escape in all directions and cause a variety of complications, a comprehensive and thorough treatment method is necessary. German static electricity therapy has a great effect of completely and thoroughly eliminating the nests of gonococci. In addition, the gonorrhea panacea "Kelinnong" is used to promote the subtle anti-gonorrheal phagocytic action of various cells inside the body. Therefore, compared with the general local surgical treatments, it is naturally safer and more thorough. If gonorrhea patients develop arthritis, German anti-gonorrheal blood serum can also be injected intravenously to eliminate gonococcal toxins in the bloodstream and break down the adhesions in the joints. Diagnosis hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty numbers will be given out each day, and each number will cost only five corners.</p>

<p>Eleventh Document</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry has recently issued the eleventh document of important Polish archives, which is a document from Polish Ambassador to France Lucas Wisiz to his Foreign Minister on January 29, 1939. The original text is translated as follows: "On the 24th of this month, I had a friendly conversation with the US Ambassador to France, Belle, about the following: "Regarding the wording of the application submitted by the four powers and how Poland should respond, I have heard something about it. However, judging from the reports revealed in the newspapers and the information I have obtained from various sources, the British proposal seems very naive. Germany and Poland have vastly different strengths, and Britain is actually instructing Poland to work with Germany to find a compromise that would benefit Chamberlain's domestic policies. Even more foolish is that the British government has clearly expressed its desire to cooperate with the Soviet Union in order to adapt to Chamberlain's domestic policies. This attempt makes other countries feel that Britain does not want to protect the countries that have been threatened by Germany's new policies, but rather wants to make things difficult for Hitlerism. Its ultimate goal is not to maintain peace, but to overthrow Germany. All those who are familiar with Poland's policies know that the Polish government does not want to easily believe Chamberlain's promises and take adventurous actions. If the British government had already mobilized the navy and implemented conscription a few days before submitting the proposal, and France had also issued an order for a larger-scale mobilization, we could seriously believe that they were sincere in their cooperation. In fact, Britain and France have not taken such measures, so it can be seen that the British diplomatic negotiations are unlikely to succeed. I have read the original text of the British proposal, and the British proposal lacks careful consideration. The Polish government can only choose its own response. Hitler may use force to oppress Poland, in which case we can only respond with force. The result will be a European war, and in the initial stages of the war, Poland will be subjected to the full force of Germany's oppression. Not only is Poland's future bleak, but it is also unfavorable to Britain and France. If Poland wants to avoid conflict with Germany, it can only stop negotiations with Britain. Hitler will regard this as an exposure of the weakness of British and French policies, which will further encourage him to expand to Eastern and Central Europe. Sooner or later, war will still break out. If the responsibility for war or peace is placed entirely on Poland's shoulders, is this not naive? In short, Britain and France should bear the most important responsibility. If the British government fails to understand this situation today, a European war or even a world war will be difficult to avoid. Ambassador Belle was moved by what I said and asked me to repeat what I said again. He then asked me if Poland would accept an alliance if Britain and France proposed it tomorrow. I replied that I could not answer this question and pointed out that the focus was not on the proposals of Britain and France, but on whether Britain would take practical measures. Belle indicated that he shared my view. The next day, Belle told me that he had asked the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, to visit Chamberlain immediately to inform him of the situation and to emphasize the responsibility that the British government bears. On the 26th, Ambassador Belle spoke to Ambassador Kennedy by phone in my presence to listen to the details of Kennedy's conversation with Chamberlain. I firmly believe that Ambassador Belle's cooperation at this critical moment is beneficial to us. Therefore, I am detailing the situation to you for your consideration.

<p>Changyinsha Correspondence, Jiangyin has fallen for two years and three months. Initially, the fallen counties of Su and Chang were urged by the Japanese to establish puppet county offices one after another. However, the people of Jiangyin are upright and deeply possess the legacy of Yan Dian Shi, and no one is willing to take up the post. Later, the Japanese intended to appoint gentleman Wu Tingyang and even sent a special car to Shanghai to bring him back to Jiangyin. Wu firmly declined. On December 24, 1938, He Peixuan became the puppet county magistrate. He, who is over sixty years old, has lived a secluded life since taking the puppet post. Since March of the first year, warning letters have flown in like snowflakes. A few months ago, He's nerves were suddenly greatly stimulated, and he became like a drunkard or a madman. His diet and daily life were greatly disrupted, and he has become mentally ill. Seeing He's actions, the Japanese decided to look for someone else to replace him. Coincidentally, Lai Lantian, who had previously served as the captain of the anti-smuggling salt affairs team, often engaged in salt affairs in Jiangyin. He is also nearly seventy years old and is a dim-witted old man. Therefore, he was favored by the Japanese. A few days ago, Bian Shang, the puppet police chief, accompanied Lai Lantian to Suzhou to meet with Chen Zemin, the puppet governor. However, the exact date of Lai's inauguration is still uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Letter <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao: I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Mr. Hong Qiliang, who has requested that I address a matter of concern. We have read a news item in the Shen Bao of the 30th of last month stating that the traitorous merchant Hong Qiliang of Dinghai was executed by firing squad. We were shocked to read this, as the facts stated are largely inaccurate. Although my client's name has been deliberately altered, the pronunciation is the same, which is greatly detrimental to his reputation. The Dinghai Grain Company is a branch of the Ningbo Grain Company. Although my client was in charge of its operations, all actions were taken in accordance with resolutions. He believes that he has not committed any faults. Dinghai fell, and the company was also shut down. Since then, he has resigned from his position and has not been involved in any external affairs. How could he dare to hoard rice and create shortages, and even give people an excuse to confuse the facts? We have been specially commissioned to write this letter to request a correction. We sincerely hope that you will take this matter into consideration and allow us to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to avoid misunderstandings and clarify the facts. We would be deeply grateful. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Shou'e, April 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Ministry of Education to Implement New Social Education Plan Starting in July This Year, Establishing Guaranteed National Schools in Every Security Region Across the Country, Eliminating Illiteracy for 21 Million People Within One Year <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airline News) Regarding the overall plan for social education facilities of the Ministry of Education, according to Chen Lijiang, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education: (1) Before July this year, social education in various parts of the country will continue to promote civic education in accordance with the established plan. After July, in accordance with the outline of the new county system organization throughout the country, each security region should establish a guaranteed national school. Each school must include adult classes and women's classes, and the existing social education institutions will be merged. It is estimated that from July this year to the end of June next year, 21 million illiterate people should be eliminated nationwide. (2) Reorganize and improve the national county public education halls. The public education halls are the central institutions for implementing social education and are responsible for guiding and instructing the guaranteed national schools throughout the county. The Ministry of Education has transferred and trained the directors of public education halls in counties across the country. The training in the Northwest and Southwest provinces will be divided into five phases and is expected to be completed within this year. (3) Promote art education, including music, drama, and fine arts. This year, four touring drama education teams will be established, and two additional touring teaching vehicles will be added, for a total of three, to tour various places and teach in depth among the people. A National Conservatory of Music will be established and is expected to be completed in July or August after the summer vacation this year. The conservatory will be divided into three departments: one for training, gathering students from elementary school to high school who excel in music and training them; the second for research, bringing together Chinese and Western music experts to organize ancient music and study Western music; and the third for performance, establishing vocal and orchestral groups to experiment with songs created by the Ministry of Education and to train completed students to tour and perform in various places, increasing the national interest in musical arts. (4) Electrification education, divided into film and broadcasting, to produce films with anti-war consciousness on a large scale and show them in various counties. In the future, every guaranteed national school must be equipped with a radio receiver to promote government orders and allow students to listen to domestic and foreign news. In addition, in order to create a large number of teachers for national schools, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated that teacher training classes be added in the third grade of junior high school. Those who are 17 years old or older, have an average score of 70 or higher, and are willing to serve as teachers in national schools can choose to study, it is said.</p>

<p>Complete Elimination Planned for This Year, Fifth Session of People's Schools to Open on Schedule</p>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) According to a survey conducted by the Wartime People's Education Promotion Committee in September of the 27th year, there are approximately 100,000 uneducated adults in Chongqing. As of mid-January of last year, the People's Education Committee had conducted four sessions of people's schools, each session lasting two months. The teaching targets were entirely adult citizens. The first session had 227 classes with 3,688 students, the second had 323 classes with a total of 15,774 students, the third had 101 classes with a total of 3,825 students, and the fourth had 156 classes with a total of 11,189 students. The total number of people educated in the four sessions was over 34,000. This fell far short of the initial goal of 400 classes per session, totaling 20,000 people, and the objective of completely eliminating illiteracy within a year. There were many reasons for this, such as (1) financial difficulties, (2) the lack of diligent assistance from the Baojia heads, and (3) a lack of deep understanding among the people at the beginning. Currently, there are more than 60,000 illiterate people remaining. The Wartime People's Education Promotion Committee plans to completely eliminate them this year and has increased the budget to 70,000 yuan, still for four sessions, with each session expected to educate 15,000 people. The fifth session of people's schools is scheduled to open on the 15th of next month, with a total of 300 classes. The People's Education Committee will run 100 classes, the Teachers' Service Corps of the Ministry of Education will run 100 classes, and various government agencies will be entrusted to run 100 classes. This year, there will be significant improvements in the quality and quantity of students and teaching materials. The People's Education Promotion Committee convened more than 300 teachers from all the people's schools and invited Director Chen of the Ministry of Education and Director Bao of the Chongqing Social Affairs Bureau to speak, providing detailed instructions for future work. They also encouraged the teachers to first establish their faith and get close to the people, so that Chongqing's people's education could serve as a model for the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Research on Physiological Psychology, Neuroanatomy, etc.</p>
<p>The research work of the Institute of Psychology, Academia Sinica, is divided into three departments: physiological psychology research, comparative neuroanatomy research, and industrial psychology research. Before the July 7th Incident, physiological psychology research focused on the electrophysiological research of the visual system (from the retina to the visual center of the cerebral cortex), the study of vascular sensory organs, and the study of the inner ear balance sensory organs. Comparative neuroanatomy research focused on the study of the cerebral cortex and the creation of monkey brain maps. Industrial psychology research focused on the selection and training of workers in textile factories and the improvement of working conditions. Since the July 7th Incident, most of the textile factories have been destroyed or fallen into enemy hands, and the research work of industrial psychology has become almost impossible. After the Institute moved to Guizhou Province, the research work of physiological psychology had to be slightly changed due to the lack of basic laboratory equipment in the inland. Recently, the work in this area has focused on studying the development of swimming and balance reflexes in tadpoles (frog embryos) and the impact on this development after removing various parts of the nervous system and sensory organs before hatching. This type of work requires very few instruments and does not require special equipment. Furthermore, those who have studied embryonic behavior in the past have not paid attention to the impact of removing various parts of the nervous system and sensory organs on the development of behavior. The Institute is currently preparing a new laboratory in Guizhou.</p>

<p>Total of Ten Schools with Paper, Tea, Dyeing, and Other Departments</p>
<p>(Yong'an Correspondence) Fujian Province has decided to prepare ten county-run junior practical vocational schools within this year. The Department of Education has designated Liancheng and Shaowu counties to run paper industry departments, Longyan County to run dyeing departments, Ninghua County to run dyeing and weaving chemical engineering departments, Dehua County to run ceramics departments, and Fu'an and Anxi counties to run tea industry departments, Liancheng and Qingliu counties to run agricultural departments, and Nanping County to run ironworking departments. The list of these schools has been ordered by the provincial government to be followed by the county governments of Liancheng and other counties. The main points of the school establishment methods are listed below: (1) Each school will temporarily operate one class as a principle and expand year by year.

<h3 id="e81">Finance: Foreign Exchange Positions Continue to be Released <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. There were very few fluctuations in the black market for British and American exchange rates. The futures market showed an increasing easing trend, while the spot market was no different from the previous weekend, because most operators abandoned the near term and focused on the far term, but the action lacked persuasive power, resulting in a minimal impact. The morning opened flat as before. Soon, Huahing took the lead in releasing positions, and foreign banks accepted them, so the buying and selling were even. After 10 o'clock, Huahing continued to release positions on the market, and speculators also mutually released positions, so the futures market already showed signs of easing. By the end of the evening, transactions were sparse. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices all showed slight firmness.</p>
<p>The Easing Trend of Futures is Gradually Intensifying</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, overseas exchange rates, British vs. American, Shanghai, and French, were all flat. American rose half a point against British, unchanged against Shanghai, and rose 1.25 against French. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning: British gold 4 shillings 1.125, American exchange rate 6.15625 yuan, both flat from the closing price on Saturday. At the same time, futures opened and were also stable. After the opening, Huahing first came to release positions, with Huahing doing spot American exchange rate 6.15625 yuan with foreign banks, and the market remained flat. HSBC's listed prices were announced and did not move. The balance tax on silver was announced and there was no increase or decrease. After 10 o'clock, Huahing continued to release positions, and speculators followed suit and sold, causing the futures market to harden at this time. The American exchange rate for this month could be settled at 6.0935 yuan. Foreign banks benefited from absorbing Huahing, Continental, and Shanghai's American exchange rate for this month at 6.09375 yuan, and the May exchange rate at 5.9375 yuan. Chinese merchants sold American exchange rate for this month to foreign banks for 6.125 yuan. There were no major changes until noon. Spot prices were similar to the morning opening prices. Futures British gold and next month's prices all eased by 0.015625, and American exchange rates also rose by 0.03125 each.</p>
<p>Little Up or Down in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market situation was very quiet, with little up or down. American banks once entered Huahing Continental's American exchange rate for this month at 6.125 yuan. Later, American banks sold American exchange rate for this month to Foreign Banks at 6.125 yuan. The closing results were: spot British gold and American exchange rate remained at 4 shillings 1.125 and 6.15625 yuan, American gold for this month at 4 shillings 0.078125, American exchange rate at 6.09375 yuan, May British gold at 3 shillings 0.70984375, American exchange rate at 5.9375 yuan, with no difference from the spot prices on Saturday. British gold and American exchange rate for this month each eased by 0.015625 and 0.03125, and May also hardened by 0.015625 and 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British and American Exchange Rates Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 8th (Monday) report: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. British exchange rates, spot and futures, were unchanged. American exchange rate spot also opened at the original price, while the forward rate shrunk by 0.0625 to 22 yuan. Shanghai exchange rate spot fell by one yuan to 359 yuan. Japanese exchange rate spot rose by half a yuan to 94 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable, and there were no changes in various exchange rates. The market opened at 2:30 PM and was still stable, with no gains or losses in various exchange rates.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Exchange Rate Turns Easy</p>
<p>Tianjin, 8th (Monday) report: The foreign exchange market opened firm this morning. British and Shanghai exchange rates still opened at the original price. American exchange rate spot eased by 0.03125 to 5.84375 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" was 0.5 yuan cheaper at 101.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold Market Tired and Unable to Rise, Falling into the 400 Yuan Range</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation: tired and unable to rise. The continuous decline has reached six days, because the foreign exchange market's flatness tends to ease, and people's interest in buying gold has decreased considerably. Furthermore, because the environment has no stimulation, the price is difficult to increase. The initial opening immediately pressed down 15 yuan to 5,410 yuan, which was still the day's high. The situation was even worse later, because foreign exchange futures were reported hard again. Silver number gangs and retail investors gathered to sell, and the supply and demand disparity was huge for a time, falling miserably below the 5,400 yuan mark to 5,375 yuan. Fortunately, the securities gang tried their best to maintain it, and gold shops and money changers also absorbed it from time to time. The floating remaining chips gradually tightened, and finally closed at 5,397 yuan. As a result, it fell 28 yuan lower than the previous weekend. The total transaction volume was more than 2,000 taels. Gold ornaments in silver buildings did not change. Customs gold and other items remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Has Declined for Six Consecutive Days</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the popularity of each bar (ten taels) was still tired, and there were many sellers. First, the securities gang sold ten taels to the silver number for 5,410 yuan, which was 15 yuan less than the previous closing. Later, most buyers were on the sidelines. On the contrary, the selling trend was stronger. Gold shops and retail investors competed to sell. Soon, it fell another 30 yuan. The gold shop sold a total of 50 taels to money changers for 5,380 yuan. But at that time, a certain money changer agreed to scoop it up, and the gold shop also followed up with purchases, while the number of sellers gradually decreased. The price returned to 18 yuan. The securities gang sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 5,398 yuan. After that, because foreign exchange futures were reported hard, those who entered suddenly stopped their activities. The silver number gang tended to release, and it fell 23 yuan. Silver numbers traded 50 taels with each other for 5,375 yuan. Then the money changer and the gold shop saw the price was cheap and scooped it up again, rising 22 yuan again. The gold shop entered 30 taels into the money changer for 5,397 yuan. At noon, the silver number gang's bulls came out again, and the money changers also intended to sell at that time, and it fell 17 yuan again. The silver number sold 10 taels to the money changer for 5,380 yuan as the noon closing price. The initial opening in the afternoon was flat and tired. First, the money changer sold 10 taels to the silver number, still for 5,380 yuan. After a while, the securities gang suddenly came to search and lift it up by 8 yuan. The securities gang entered 30 taels into the money changer for 5,388 yuan. However, a certain silver number's intention to sell became stronger, and it sold dozens of taels again, pressing it down again by 6 yuan. The silver number sold 30 taels to the money changer for 5,382 yuan. Later, the securities gang came to dig in again, and the silver number had no intention to sell, and other sellers saw the decline, and then returned to a high of 15 yuan. The securities gang entered 20 taels into the gold shop for 5,397 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell another 28 yuan compared to the previous weekend. It has been small for six consecutive days, totaling 158 yuan. The full-day range was only 35 yuan. The cash gold shop's brand gold selling price is higher than the spot price, and the purchase price is reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little opening.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in silver buildings remained unchanged. Datongxing still hangs 545 yuan. Xin Tongxing is the same as the previous price, and the purchase price is reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Reduced by Another Four Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Rebounds by Two Points</p>
<p>Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate continued to decline. Every thousand yuan in the morning fell from 64 yuan to 60 yuan, and in the afternoon it slightly recovered to 61 yuan, which was 4 yuan less than the previous Saturday. The Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate was posted at 2 corners in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 2 points.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Differently <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: British and American gold pounds followed the spot market price and continued downstream. American dollar notes continued to fall due to the rise in the forward foreign exchange rate. The initial transaction was 16.15 yuan, and then it fell further to 16.07 yuan. Later, it once returned to 16.12 yuan, and in the afternoon it fell back to 16.07 yuan. In the afternoon, it once rose to 16.14 yuan, and in the evening market it fell back to 16.11 yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes remained flat. There was a slight demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose slightly. French franc notes had a very firm trend. There was no shortage of demand for Singapore and Philippine notes, and the market price rose consistently. Japanese gold notes were very strong in the morning, once reaching 1.33 yuan. The afternoon saw a slight rebound, and the evening market was 1.32 yuan. The demand for Korean notes was still strong, and the evening market was as high as 1.1125 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both fell by 0.5 yuan, American dollar notes fell by 0.06 yuan, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.01 yuan, French franc notes rose by 0.002 yuan, Singapore notes rose by 0.1 yuan, Philippine notes rose by 0.05 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Soar <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for securities was still firm. Although transactions were slightly reduced, the trend turned into a shortage of chips due to the lack of large-scale sellers. The difficulty of bank loans was also a major reason. The ninth lottery of Type C will be held tomorrow morning, so afternoon trading today will be calculated excluding the winning numbers. Although the number of lottery draws is still only eight, people's hopes of winning the lottery are more enthusiastic than last time, so if there are no changes in the environment after the lottery, the market price is not easy to fall sharply. In the past, there was a tendency to look small, but later, because Nos. 20 and Qianfu both made large purchases, the general public's sentiment changed, and Shengda Runli and retail investors also tended to buy. On the market, only Lianyi Jiufeng Changji and sporadic retail investors sold at high prices. The morning market price rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, Nos. 20 and Xinfu still bought heavily, and No. 16 also bought Type B enthusiastically. Others such as Zhenkang Shuntai Yichang Jiufeng also received considerable income. Although Tongkang Hongda Jiufu supplied a lot, they could not overwhelm the multi-party momentum. As a result, they all rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan, and the total number of transactions was about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Hanyang Iron and Steel Company were traded at a price of 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Association was extremely large because it was the beginning of the trading week. The afternoon market was exceptionally lively. As soon as the price rebounded, buyers came to pull it up. British Union shares rose sharply, once reaching 44 yuan, but this price attracted profit-takers to sell, and the closing price returned to 42 yuan. Yangzi Silver Company has been neglected recently, but yesterday it became energetic and gained new help. 70,000 shares were traded, and the price rose to 17.5 yuan. Measuring the huge amount of transactions, the rising trend does not seem excessive. The trading volume of Ewo Cotton Mill shares was not large, and the closing price also rose to 47 yuan. The opening price of China Reclamation shares was 17.6 yuan, and after the opening, it went straight to the sky, creating a high price of 19.4 yuan. Although this price attracted a lot of profit-taking, buyers still absorbed it at a price of over 19 yuan at the close, refusing to let go. The popularity of this share can be said to be extreme.</p>
<p>Fewer rubber shares were traded, but the public also seemed to have considerable interest in this, and the closing price was firm.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Yarn and Cotton: After the Suspension of Futures Trading, the Rising Trend of Spot Yarn Resumes <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned from tired to tight. This is because demand in the South China area continues unabated. Therefore, the rising trend of Chinese yarn has resumed. Although futures trading has been suspended, those with abundant general economic conditions are absorbing and hoarding spot goods.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn was tired due to the mutual settlement price of the April term. The price of 20s Double Horse spot yarn initially traded at 1,112 yuan. Later, it was heard that customer demand was good, and the Guangbang's intake was still smooth. There were quite a few people searching in the market. Later, spot goods gradually rose to 1,148 yuan, which was 33 yuan higher than the previous day. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were 1,565 bales, and the market was still trending upward. Yesterday, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Fujian. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade 860 Hong Kong 660</p>
<p>Inland 25 Xiamen 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi 10 Statistics 1,565</p>
<h3 id="e85">Japanese Merchants Purchase American Cotton <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were flat, but American cotton transactions were particularly strong. Japanese merchants in factories purchased it strongly, while Chinese factories had a narrow intake, so the market was stable and quiet. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Middling 175.75 265.50 Same Trade purchased 700 pieces</p>
<p>Also 277.75 East China purchased 100 pieces</p>
<p>Also 268.00 Inside and Outside purchased 400 pieces</p>
<p>North Pacific 204.00 Same Trade purchased 220 bales</p>
<p>Dazhongji 133.00 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially failed to revive due to rain in the drought-stricken area and the selling of spot merchants, as well as the weekend. As a result, the closing price fell by 2-3 pounds per sound compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, surged 10 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose 3-5 pounds per sound.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions were firmer yesterday due to the strengthening of the Indian market, the yarn price tended to be flat again due to the slight easing of the exchange rate. The intention of the industry was that the silver supply on the market was extremely tight, and the future cotton market was difficult to grasp, and the factory recently had a large number of Indian cotton orders, so the intention of the industry became weak and temporarily planned to wait and see. Yesterday's trading was quite quiet. The factory delivery prices converted to American exchange rate of 6.125 yuan are as follows:</p>
<p>20s American Middling 286.75</p>
<p>Also Also Lower Grade 276.15</p>
<p>30s Also 301.60</p>
<p>Also Also Lower Grade 292.50</p>
<p>42s Also 306.50</p>

<h3 id="e86">Oil Market: Hong Kong Syndicate Actively Deals in Crude Oil, Sales Prices Soar by Six Yuan, Soybean Oil Also Lifted <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Crude Oil: Yesterday's oil market saw considerable fluctuations. Initially, soybean trends were stable, so people were generally cautious and the market saw little change. Later, inquiries for peanut oil suddenly came from Hong Kong syndicates, bringing news of rising production prices, which excited the market. With bullish sentiment prevailing, sellers aggressively raised prices, resulting in a sharp increase of six yuan compared to the closing price before the weekend (the 4th). 500 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 74 yuan, and 2,500 tins of Yantai canned oil were traded at 96.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: Due to the drastic fluctuations in crude oil, the market jumped by two yuan at the opening. Partway through, some powerful players seized the opportunity to sell, which dampened market sentiment and briefly caused a decline of one or two yuan. Although the market still ended up two yuan, its underlying momentum lacked stable strength. Yesterday, a total of over 600 barrels of Dalian oil were traded (price details in the Market Prices column), along with 60 barrels of Qingdao oil, 30 barrels of Jiangbei oil, 10 barrels of Bengbu oil, and 300 dan of Dayou factory oil. Yesterday, 70 cases of soybean oil arrived from Qingdao. Furthermore, 16,000 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Quanzhou today (the 9th), along with 3,000 bags of fertilizer to Fujian.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sugar Market: Taikoo Refined Sugar Continues to Be Sluggish <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to a Dutch telegram, raw white sugar (C.I.F. &amp; KG) increased by 0.03 Dutch guilders, calculated at 9.10. Because the telegram arrived late, the local guild's quotation has not yet improved. It may rise today. Current spot prices for 24 coarse granulated white sugar are 62 yuan for new foreign warehouse goods and 61.8 yuan for old goods. Taikoo granulated sugar remains sluggish: B mark West Warehouse at 68.1 yuan, CW mark West Warehouse at 67.8 yuan, CX mark West Warehouse at 67.5 yuan, DY mark West Warehouse at 67.2 yuan, and HX mark West Warehouse at 67 yuan. Eastern warehouse prices declined by 0.03 yuan. There were no other changes. The national sugar guild opened a small amount of darker Zhangzhou red sugar at 40 yuan. Yesterday, 1,350 tons of sugar arrived from the Netherlands, and 77 bags arrived from Haikou.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Piece Goods: Coarse Cloth is the Most Sought After <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>National Cloth: The market was steady in the morning but firm in the afternoon, remaining briskly sold. Due to the surge in yarn prices, sales prices for all goods were consistently strong. Bleached cloth rose by 0.05 yuan per bolt, colored cloth and colored twill rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan, and fine cloth twill rose by 0.01 to 0.025 yuan. Sixteen-pound and fourteen-pound coarse cloths were the most sought after. Sichuan-Yunnan syndicates handled over 1,000 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, etc. Guangdong syndicates handled over 400 pieces of colored cloth, pongee, coarse cloth, etc. Wenzhou-Ningbo syndicates handled over 300 pieces of bleached cloth, raw-colored yarn, pongee, fine cloth, etc. Locally, 500-600 pieces of various goods were traded.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to market restrictions on further futures trading, the morning market was flat and weak. Leading fine cloth was offered for sale at 32.7 yuan. Unexpectedly, the local market saw strong real demand, with a difference of 0.025 yuan per bolt between spot fine cloth and warehouse receipts. At the same time, due to the rebound in cotton yarn, hoarders returned to scour the market. The closing price for leading fine cloth reached a new high of 33.2 yuan per bolt. Serge rose to 0.09975 yuan per yard. It is rumored that high-end raw fine cloth from Hankou requires 30 yuan in Japanese currency, equivalent to 37.8 yuan in legal tender. With direct shipments from Japanese merchants, deducting 1.5 yuan for water transport, the profit from shipping from Shanghai to Hankou is considerable. Therefore, the number of fine cloths directly shipped to the Yangtze River area has been substantial in recent days.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 68 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Ningbo. Today (the 9th), 1,500 pieces will be shipped to Fujian.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Spring Ladies' Overcoats: Scramble to Buy Rabbit Hair Fabric <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Rabbit hair fabric is needed by all ladies' clothing businesses, especially those around the Fourth Avenue, where transactions are even more robust. Ladies in Shanghai are scrambling for rabbit hair fabric for their spring overcoats. Pistachio green and light reddish-gray are particularly popular. However, stocks are limited, and the cost of new goods is high, resulting in very expensive selling prices. Nonetheless, Shanghai women are mostly willing to pay the price, as eight or nine out of ten value lightweight and all-wool fabric. As long as they can wear such a coat, it's like having a white dragon overcoat. Not wearing rabbit hair fabric is considered unfashionable and not showing off. Yesterday, the assorted first-grade rabbit hair fabric was priced at 26 yuan per yard, second-grade at 22-23 yuan, and ordinary third-grade all sold for around 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Prices Rebound, Local Market Also Sees Slight Recovery <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yokohama silk prices have rebounded, with spot prices at 1,450 yuan, up 60 yuan. Near-term is at 1,470 yuan, up 71 yuan, and long-term at 1,450 yuan, up 35 yuan. However, market sentiment suggests it will ultimately weaken. Before the new silk comes out, one side wants to raise market prices to sell off existing stock, while the other side wants to depress prices to benefit cocoon collection. Therefore, the current fluctuations in silk prices are a small rebound before a large decline.</p>
<p>Fifty dan of silk were traded in the local silk market yesterday, and silk prices showed signs of recovery. Foreign firms also made transactions. Please see the Market Prices section. Additionally, 24 packages of yellow silk arrived from Yantai yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Green Tea European Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, European firms dealing in green tea noticed that tea sales in Hong Kong recently have not been sufficient to meet demand. They have become more interested in the remaining "Zhen Mei" and "Zhu Cha" teas in the Shanghai market. A total of 360-odd boxes of ordinary "Zhen Mei" and "Shrimp Eye Zhu Cha" tea were purchased by Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Bowring, and Jardine Skinner. "Zhen Mei" tea was sold at 220-254 yuan, and "Zhu Cha" tea was bought at 270-340 yuan. There were no changes in prices.</p>

<p>Sales of various types of coal dust have slowed recently, as the weather is warming up, water heaters have stopped being used, and factories have increasingly switched to diesel for their furnaces. The supply of cheap coal dust for the cooked water industry is also sufficient, so its market is weak. Due to various reasons, sales have greatly decreased, and prices are unsustainable. First-grade dust is quoted at 215 yuan per ton, and second-grade dust at 200 yuan, but there are no buyers. It is said that if new goods flood the market, prices will decline further.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Grain: Indica Rice Has Been Successfully Transported, Yesterday the Source Gradually Became Prosperous and There Was a Price Limit Broken, Western Rice Slightly One or Two Yuan Still Lacking Buyers <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Following the usual Sunday holiday in the rice market, there have been long-standing rumors that the thick and thin japonica and early and late indica rice, etc. from the country will soon be opened. Although no official announcement has been seen, it has already been manifested in reality. The Hongkou Dachang Company, hosted by the Japanese, has been transporting rice from the Suxichangyisu area in the interior to Shanghai. The first batch that has arrived has been more than 10,000 bags, and subsequent batches are still continuing. Therefore, it is estimated that 4,000-5,000 bags of japonica and glutinous rice have been transferred from the Hongkou district into the Concession. If the Nan Gang sees early and late rice businesses selling a large amount on the market, and the selling price is even cheaper, falling into the 40-yuan price limit, selling only 29 yuan and 38.5 yuan. Although other thick and thin japonica rice still lacks normal transactions, they are all dark trades, but it is heard that the goods are prosperous and also unanimously trending downwards. The Chang Gang High Indica has already only opened at 43.5 yuan, the mid-city ones at 40 yuan, Su Kun japonica rice 42.5 yuan, 42 yuan, Li Sheng japonica rice 412 yuan, Qing Si special thin 42 yuan, and Zhongguan around 41 yuan, which is about 1.5 yuan less than the previous market. The glutinous rice market is abundant in goods, and is more double-pressured by the Cao Gen tip. Although the market has been so cheap, it has still lacked the main buyer, the market only shed 1 yuan. In addition to the high-holding goods selling for 35.5 yuan, the rest are all only between 345 yuan. The glutinous rice market has reached this point, which is really unprecedented. In various Western rices, they are greatly affected by domestic rice.</p>
<p>As for various Western rices, they are greatly affected by domestic rice, and they are even more unable to gain a foothold. In general, the cargo owners originally intended to hold on to all the goods that were not renewed after the April futures were cleared, and they had no intention of selling lightly. Now, the source of domestic rice has suddenly been dredged, and a large number has arrived in port. Floating hoards of scattered households are scrambling to sell, but the market cannot be shaken. Once it is shaken, even if you shout yourself hoarse, everyone will turn a blind eye, fighting less opponents, the market is full of goods, Western rice and domestic rice are mixed together, and there are no wholesale transactions. As a result, the closing market has already shed 1-2 yuan. No. 1 Saigon is only 41 yuan, 40 yuan and 5 cents, No. 2 is 37.5 yuan, Fire twist 40 yuan, No. 2 Siam 37.5 yuan, Small twist 37 yuan, Mixed broken 33 yuan, Next to 30 yuan, Miru 35.7 yuan, 35.5 yuan, Looking back at the overall situation of the rice market, since the sudden surge in the past year, it was only because the domestic source at that time suddenly ceased, and the supply of rice in Shanghai was insufficient, resulting in it. Afterwards, the design to order Western rice, although it once returned to a flat, but with a drop in the bucket, it was low and expensive again. There were also no lack of speculative manipulation of monopoly, the total is that domestic rice is controlled by people, recently the benefits are exclusively enjoyed, and transportation can be connected, then the price of rice must be restored one day, but it must be unimpeded, the source is endless, and the surcharges and taxes are removed, and the people's food can be slightly relieved.</p>
<p>Western rice has also arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company Taiyuan wheeled arrived at port yesterday afternoon, transporting 10,266 bags of Western rice from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Factory Flour Prices Depreciate, Wheat Also Loosens <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is quite loose and abusive, it has been found that the 　 factory market, since the end of the flat sale period, has been standing at a high price of 13.8 yuan for a long time, resulting in a daily reduction in the sales of this street. The price of rice has repeatedly fallen, and the price of flour is more expensive than rice, in fact, sales are even more weak. It is even more affected by the dumping of flour from the mainland. The factory has to voluntarily depreciate, and the factory market has been changed to 13.5 yuan, which is 3 points lower than last week. The recycling of goods is also affected by this, which is also an angle outside the fall compared to last week. It is estimated that the opening of the old car Spleen is 13.43 yuan, and the transfer of the battleship brand is 13.07 yuan. The prices of other brands such as Double Lion Mountain Deer are also loose. It is estimated that the total transaction of each flour is about 10,000 bags. It is also heard that the export of flour is blocked by the Japanese side, and it is feared that the export sales will be difficult to develop for a while.</p>
<p>The wheat market also turned tired and fell, because the factory disk in the flour market has been changed to a low of 3 angles, the Huachang import stomach is available, the eating disk has paid more attention, and at the moment, the Japanese factory and the export road are stagnant, and in the step-down sound of various prices, people's hearts are naturally difficult to look good, so the cargo side has been difficult to struggle, and a total of 1,5600 bags were removed from the Fuxin Fufeng two factories. It is estimated that Chang Xi wheat is 23 yuan, and Wuhu wheat is 22.5 yuan to 4.5 yuan, which is half a yuan smaller than last week.</p>

<h3 id="e96">The Election Reaches the Final Stage, Formal Elections Begin Tomorrow, the Anglo-American United Front Holds a Superior Position, the German Newspaper Strongly Urges Jews to Abstain from Voting <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The election of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has entered an even more intense stage since yesterday morning, as the decisive period is approaching and voting will begin tomorrow (10th and 11th). The outcome of this election is most closely related to the future of the concession. Whether the administration of the concession will be controlled by the Japanese or a portion of it will be seized, or whether the status quo can be maintained, all depends on the outcome of this election. What should be seriously noted by Chinese and foreign people is that if the Japanese seize the administrative power of the concession by other means, the Japanese will inevitably be attacked by Chinese and foreign people. The British and Americans will lodge a serious protest with the Japanese, believing that the Japanese violated international law, but if the Japanese obtain the administrative power of the concession by means of election, the third country cannot find a reason to protest. Therefore, the outcome of this election has a great relationship with the future of the concession. Therefore, according to another American overseas Chinese, although he is not very interested in the administrative policy of the Municipal Council at ordinary times, he also believes that if the Japanese threat does not materialize, the future of the concession and the Municipal Council will be more favorable in the future.</p>
<p>Chinese side 　 gives deep importance</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council's board election, in addition to the five Chinese directors, still elected Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun to continue to serve as representatives of Chinese taxpayers, the rest of the British, American, and Japanese directors have been scheduled to be held at the Wanguo Commercial Group Training Center and Hongkou Small Vegetable Market from 7 noon to 3 pm tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Because the Japanese side suddenly increased the number of candidates to five in this session, hoping to use political offensive to realize the attempt to change the existing state of the concession, the enthusiasm of the British, American, and Japanese expatriates engaged in the election has been white-hot for several days. Now that the election period is approaching, the winner will be determined in two days. This matter is deeply concerned by all parties because it is related to the entire concession administration. Although the Chinese side maintains a silent attitude, it also gives it consistent importance. According to a taxpayer surnamed a certain gentleman, foreigners often take the increase in population and the increase in tax payment as an excuse for electing the number of directors, but in fact, Chinese people account for an absolute majority of the population, and the burden of tax payment is also the heaviest for Chinese people, so municipal facilities should not ignore the welfare of Chinese people.</p>
<p>The election has entered 　 the final stage</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News said that the week starting from the 8th is a rare and important period in the history of the Public Concession. The issue of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council will be decided, and whether the Japanese will obtain control of the Municipal Council, whether the status quo can be maintained, or whether the proportion of directors will be slightly changed will be decided within this week. The election dates are Wednesday and Thursday. The election campaign has entered the final stage. Expatriates from all countries have intense activities. Japan's attempt to gain control will be met with fierce competition from all parties.</p>
<p>The strength of the two sides is equal</p>
<p>Today, there are two main forces, confronting each other, and the strength is almost equal. There are 3,700 voting rights for the Japanese side this time. The British and American voting rights, which were estimated at 3,500 rights yesterday, are heard to be increasing. Because British and American taxpayers who have the right to vote are still registering at the Municipal Council. A small number of expatriates with voting rights also seem to be divided into two factions, one for Latin expatriates, namely Portugal and Italy. It is heard that they are all determined to be on the Japanese side, and it is expected that a part of the German expatriates and White Russians will also elect the five Japanese candidates. German has a total of 700 voting rights, and it seems to be divided into two factions, one supporting and one opposing "Aryans", the latter are mostly Jewish refugees.</p>
<p>Political action 　 is worth pondering</p>
<p>According to a refugee yesterday, the methods used by the Japanese in this regard are quite similar to those used by Hitler in the early days of his rise. The Japanese activities are said to be completely legal, and so was Hitler. This is the question of what will happen once in power. According to well-informed sources, if the Japanese obtain control of the Public Concession, third countries cannot protest based on "illegal one or violation of international law". The current situation is that semi-totalitarian countries are trying to defeat democratic countries using so-called democratic methods.</p>
<p>The Bureau has received 　 a good lesson</p>
<p>Another American overseas Chinese said yesterday that he sincerely hates the methods of the Municipal Council. If the Japanese threat to dominate is not successful, this threat will have a good impact on the residents of the Municipal Council and the Public Concession, at least. Today, the rulers of the Bureau are extremely frightened and will have to implement strict reforms. Taxpayers have also woken up and will demand action from the Bureau after the election.</p>
<p>Japanese slander 　 British people are ridiculous</p>
<p>The Japanese allegations that the Public Concession Police Department sent personnel to coerce Jewish refugees in the Huishan area on the 5th of this month not to elect Japanese candidates were firmly denied by the Huishan Police Station police yesterday. The above said was published in the Japanese Shanghai Daily News and forwarded by Allied Press, roughly saying that at about 3 pm on the 5th, seven British police officers in uniform and twenty Chinese police officers gathered near 800 Tangshan Road. British police officers visited Jewish refugees from house to house, asking them who they would elect and their relationship with the Japanese, and then recorded the refugees' answers. This move by the British police exceeded their authority and interfered in the election. According to police personnel, this is a propaganda nonsense, no less than a laughable myth. It is heard that the Municipal Council may lodge a protest with the Japanese Consulate General regarding this news. However, well-informed sources believe that the Police Department will probably ignore it because it is absurd and ridiculous and not worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Distribute a list 　 to attract attention</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Anglo-American Election Committee, in order to enable the third-national electors to support the Anglo-American candidates, it will issue a list of candidates for this session of the Board of Directors, with the surnames of each of the Anglo-American and Japanese candidates recorded together, but the fonts used are different. Among the Anglo-American candidates, except for lawyer Reno McDonald, the remaining seven are capitalized, so that the third-national voters concentrate on the seven. They are also prepared to pick up and drop off third-national electors by car. If the third-national electors need to take a car to the election ground to vote, they can tell their name and address according to the designated telephone number, and a car will be sent to meet them. This method is also notified in separate printed materials.</p>
<p>The German newspaper is jealous 　 and was confiscated</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources yesterday, a small team of Japanese military plainclothes officers confiscated a large number of German "Yellow Newspapers" in the Hongkou District at around 8 am yesterday. It is rumored that the newspaper had published news unfavorable to the Japanese campaign. Japanese military plainclothes officers went to each newspaper stall and shop to collect the newspaper, which was sold for a total of 1,000 copies (priced at 0.1 yuan each). The newspaper was resold, and all were confiscated. No reason was announced during the execution, nor was a penny paid. The police did not intervene in this move by the Japanese. It is also known that the newspaper has been extensively publishing news supporting the Anglo-American candidates for the past few weeks. Although the text did not explicitly advise Jews to support them, the Japanese believe that this move is enough to affect their campaign. The newspaper published an article warning that those who bribe and use the current special state to make profits will be punished by the Chinese government in the future. Another article stated that Jewish refugees should thank God for being able to escape from Germany, and should thank the democratic countries that have accommodated them in Shanghai. They should know that living in the area established by the democratic countries is the supreme happiness, and they should not be grateful for the Japanese people's permission to land. The newspaper also published a notice from the Jewish Refugee Association, advising Jewish refugees to maintain neutrality in this election, and to abstain from voting if necessary, because favoring any party would be enough to make enemies. The newspaper held an absolutely supportive attitude towards American overseas Chinese. The newspaper pointed out that Americans used the Boxer Indemnity to establish schools and hospitals, which made the relationship between the East and the West closer and can be praised.</p>
<p>Personal voting 　 cannot be overstepped</p>
<p>The Japanese Election Committee held a meeting of department directors at the Japanese Club yesterday morning, and the committee members held another meeting in the afternoon. There will be two more meetings today (committee members). In Japan, it was originally thought that if the elector himself did not arrive, he could entrust someone to vote on his behalf, but it is now clear that the party who casts the vote on his behalf is absolutely not allowed, so its election committee issued an appeal again, hoping that the Japanese overseas Chinese who have the right to vote must take the time to go to the polls. If the elector still has matters that cannot be understood, he can ask the election director of each district.</p>
<p>The Japanese people are threatening the Jewish people to help</p>
<p>The Japanese method of striving for Jewish support is now being implemented in earnest. It is said that in the Hongkou District, those who express their willingness to vote in favor of Japanese candidates have obtained a permit from the Japanese. It is also permitted to bring relatives and friends to Shanghai. It is also known that those who have obtained a permit and do not actually need it are making huge profits from the permit. It is estimated that each permit can be sold for 　 thousand yuan. The Japanese have set up a so-called election publicity office in Hongkou. The association sent propaganda officers who are good at speaking German to carry out activities, asking Jews to vote in favor of Japanese candidates, otherwise they and their relatives and friends will be harmed. However, observers all clearly believe that this kind of intimidation is not very effective, because the ballot is completely sealed, and it is difficult for the Japanese to investigate the names of voters.</p>
<p>Using White Russians 　 to distribute leaflets</p>
<p>The English-language Great America Evening News said that on Saturday night last week, there were many unemployed White Russians on Xiafei Road distributing Russian-language leaflets. This is the most recent action by a certain force to advise Russian taxpayers not to elect British candidates. The contents of the leaflets are highly critical of the British, roughly saying that "We demand that Russian people should not elect 'Municipal Council gentlemen' until the Municipal Council 'occupies one or two seats'". British directors of the Municipal Council appeal to Russian people for 　 protection every year when they compete for election, and they make false promises. Taking the White Russian team of the Commercial Corps as an example, it can be seen that the British use Russian people only when they need help. The hardships of Russian people when they move to Shanghai are compared with the preferential treatment of Jewish immigrants when they arrive here, and there is a world of difference. The Public Concession Police Department employs Russian police officers to handle Russian cases, but they have never been promoted to high positions. Therefore, Russian taxpayers should not elect British people, but should elect "a certain national who will help Russian people to be equal". Otherwise, they should cast a white vote "to show their protest".</p>
<p>Semyonov 　 acts as an accomplice</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News said that according to reliable sources, Semyonov, the leader of the pro-Japanese White Russian group in the Manchurian territory, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month and is still in this city. Mr. Xie has a White Russian bodyguard with him and appears in several large hotels in the city — It is heard that Mr. Xie used the name of a Chinese to take a Japanese ship to Shanghai on March 29. After arriving in Shanghai, he has met with several Japanese military leaders in Shanghai. The White Russian side in this city believes that Mr. Xie's arrival here is of great significance because the election of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council is about to be held, so Mr. Xie's arrival here may be related to the start of the election campaign. Rumors say that Mr. Xie is now trying to induce a majority of White Russians to vote in favor of the five Japanese candidates.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that the city's largest broadcasting station, call sign XMHA, which is American-owned, has had its programming deemed "provocative" by some parties, leading to disruptions starting from the sixth day.</p>
<p>The station's manager, Mr. Hile, and news reporter, Mr. Yarkow, have filed a formal protest with the acting American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Bottorff, stating that the Japanese are disrupting radio waves from the Hongkou area, and requesting that the Japanese authorities be contacted to cease the interference. A response from the Japanese authorities is expected today.</p>
<p>According to a statement yesterday from the radio station's personnel, the station's engineers will slightly alter the radio wave suddenly a few minutes before Mr. Yarkow broadcasts the news, which should avoid interference. This is because after the radio wave is changed, the opposing station will require half an hour to locate the new radio wave before being able to resume the interference. By then, the news report will already be completed.</p>

<p>The British government has requisitioned over ten British ships in the Far East. In Shanghai, the requisitioned vessels have mostly been tugs. It has now been learned that the British steamer Yonghe Inbira has recently been notified by the British Consulate in Shanghai that it has also been requisitioned and ordered to sail to Hong Kong to await orders. The ship was originally registered in Hong Kong and was chartered two months ago by a local shipping company in Shanghai to operate the Shanghai-Xinghua-Wenzhou route. It has a capacity of 800 tons. After arriving in Shanghai with cargo on the fifth of this month, it was originally scheduled to sail to Xinghua that same day. However, upon receiving notification from the British Consulate, all the loaded cargo was unloaded yesterday, and the ship will sail to Hong Kong within the next few days.</p>

<p>The Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills previously implemented a one-month period of selling flour at a fixed price to maintain the people's food supply and provided flour to noodle shops, bakeries, and biscuit factories as much as possible. The general populace benefited greatly. After the fixed-price period ended, due to cost considerations, the mill price was raised to 13.8 yuan per bag. To prevent manipulation by speculators, the two mills supplied flour without restriction at the mill price, making it impossible for speculators to ply their trade. The price of recycled flour on the market fell to the mill price. Now, the two mills have decided after consultation to lower the mill price of flour to 13.5 yuan per bag, starting on April 8th.</p>

<p>The issue of increasing drink money for drivers at the Xiang Sheng and four major taxi companies in the city has reached a point where the labor and management sides have had to begin negotiating over wages, after the labor side voluntarily made concessions. Another round of negotiations took place yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the screening room of the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. According to reports from Pingming News, yesterday's negotiations were still unsuccessful, but the labor side believes there is still room for discussion and has not taken further action. However, they have asked management to respond within three days at the latest. The management side also feels that negotiations have been unsuccessful after several attempts and that third-party mediation is needed. Therefore, they plan to ask the Public Works Department to participate in mediation after three days. The labor side has not expressed any opposition.</p>

<p>According to overseas Chinese who arrived in Shanghai on the 7th from Marseille, French postal liners sailing the Europe-Far East route have had irregular schedules since the start of the European war due to difficult navigation in the Mediterranean. Currently, there are, on average, two services per month, with voyages lasting anywhere from a month to forty days. According to recent news from the French shipping company, French postal liners may consider further reducing services due to certain circumstances. In the past, overseas Chinese returning from France often purchased their tickets half a month in advance, and the company would allow the sale. However, since the beginning of March, the company has stopped selling tickets to overseas Chinese returning to China because the future schedule cannot be predicted, leading many overseas Chinese to suspect that French postal liners may temporarily suspend services. The most recent French postal liner departed from Marseille on March 14th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-April. The future schedule will be known after the ship arrives in Shanghai. It is also learned that in addition to strengthening their armed equipment, French postal liners sailing the Far East route have become even more meticulous in their safety designs. The practice of turning off lights at night, which was previously limited to the Mediterranean area, has now been extended from</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association has designated its members, Yitai and Huazhong Yuantai, three larger coal companies, to supply fixed-price coal to the various boiled water businesses at a discounted price per ton. This has been done twice before, with the first time selling at a fixed price of 98 yuan per ton and the second time selling at a fixed price of 50 yuan per ton (No. 2 Hongji coal dust). The association has now decided to issue a third batch of discounted coal to be used by the boiled water businesses, which began yesterday and will last until the 13th. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM each day, "Coal Purchase Application Certificates" will be issued. Each ton will be sold at a discounted price of 50 yuan in national currency, with a limit of one ton per household. Yesterday, a total of over one hundred tons were sold. The Boiled Water Industry Association is now planning price reductions.</p>

<p>On the way, the lights are completely turned off, and passengers are prohibited from carrying flashlights. Therefore, during the "Kapellabro" steamer's thirty-day voyage, no lights were visible. Ships sailing at night are equipped with large compasses, which are used to determine the direction of travel. A small blue light is installed on the top of the ship, which cannot be seen from afar, but serves as a marker for ships sailing nearby, ensuring safety.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that, according to a reporter's investigation, in recent weeks, foreigners without consular jurisdiction and Chinese residents on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek have been summoned to a "court" for civil cases. Those who refuse the summons issued by the Japanese "officials" of the "court" are immediately arrested and often punished. The exact location of the "court" is not yet known, but it is known that the trials are held on Haining Road, roughly in the buildings occupied by the Japanese Marines. It is also known that the "court" has heard</p>
<p>Four Cases in Total</p>
<p>But no information could be obtained from the relevant parties. It is rumored that one of the cases occurred last week, when the wife of a White Russian driver, Ms. Sikov, and her children were arrested at their residence on the fourth afternoon and taken to the Japanese Marines headquarters on Haining Road. They were later released at the request of the Public Works Department's Police Force.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Arrest</p>
<p>Was because she owed a Chinese shopkeeper eighty yuan. According to absolutely reliable sources, the woman had received a summons a few days earlier but ignored it. The other three cases all involved Chinese debt disputes. It has been discovered that the consular body is unaware that the "court" is arbitrarily hearing cases.</p>

<p>The strike by workers at the British American Tobacco shipyard in Yangshupu, which began on the 14th of last month due to the management's failure to fulfill the labor-management agreement signed on December 14, 1939, has not been resolved for over three weeks. Although the labor and management sides have negotiated several times, they have failed to reach an agreement due to the vast differences in their conditions. It has been learned that last Wednesday, the management sent a final written response to the labor side, rejecting the current eleven-member delegation. On the same day, the factory workers were informed that those who wished to continue working should register immediately, and those who did not wish to work could collect their dismissal pay. Therefore, the factory workers have been holding large communal meals in the union hall since the day before yesterday, struggling to survive. Over a thousand people have participated, and the labor dispute is unlikely to be resolved immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Revitalized Christian Literature Society - General Secretary Now a Chinese National - Efforts to Innovate in Literary Work <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Christian Literature Society is the largest Christian literary organization and also the pioneer of China's publishing industry. It has a history of fifty-three years. Initially, the society published books on politics, astronomy, geography, medicine, and other sciences. Those who presided over the society included Young John Allen and Timothy Richard. The great literary figure Liang Qichao also worked there. Therefore, the society has not only made contributions to religious matters but has also provided enlightened leadership in China's political and cultural affairs. Later, major bookstores such as the Commercial Press were established one after another. The society then changed its focus and specialized in religious matters. Recently, the society's board of directors convened a meeting and believed that Christian literature should target the Chinese people and strengthen the position of the Chinese people. Therefore, it was specifically decided to adjust the administrative personnel of the society. In order to revitalize the literary lineup, important changes were also made to policies. The situation is explored below:</p>
<p>Division of Powers</p>
<p>In the past, some directors of the society were also elected as executive committee members, which appeared to create a conflict of interest. Now, the current board of directors has decided that any person serving as a director and also holding the position of a secretary cannot be re-elected as an executive committee member. Therefore, the legislative and administrative powers of the society have been clearly separated.</p>
<p>Term of Office for Secretaries</p>
<p>In the past, there was no fixed term of office for the society's secretaries. The current board of directors has also decided that the term of office for secretaries should be fixed. After the term expires, whether or not to renew the appointment will be considered to prevent the problem of incompetence.</p>
<p>Competent Leadership</p>
<p>The current board of directors of the society has also appointed several new secretaries, such as Mr. Tong Kesheng, a Western missionary who has extensive experience in literary work. He has also been elected as an acting secretary. However, what is most noteworthy is that Mr. Zhu Lide has been elected as the general secretary. For fifty-three years, the position of general secretary of the society has been held by Westerners. Although there is no shortage of capable people among Westerners, it is still difficult to manage China's literary affairs. Therefore, the current board of directors is looking for a Chinese national to take on this important task in order to achieve the goal of having Chinese nationals manage China's literary affairs. It is heard that Mr. Zhu previously served as the deputy general secretary of the National Christian Council of China. In August 1937, he was hired by the council as deputy general secretary. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, Dr. Jia Liyan, the general secretary of the council, returned to the United States, and Zhu took over as the acting secretary. During his tenure, he made outstanding contributions and was highly praised by both Chinese and Western figures. Now that the board of directors has entrusted him with this position, church members are all delighted to have found a capable person.</p>
<p>Publishing Business</p>
<p>In the past, the chairman of the society's publishing committee was also a Westerner. Recently, Dr. Xu Baoqian, a professor at Shanghai University, was elected to preside over the committee. Mr. Xu is very knowledgeable in literary matters, and he will make another contribution in the future.</p>
<p>Recruiting Talents</p>
<p>The new general secretary of the society has already sent letters to the cultural circles in China to recruit literary talents in order to revitalize the literary lineup. He also plans to cooperate with various organizations outside the society. It is expected that the society's literary work will soon have a new lineup and excellent performances.</p>
<p>Books Sell Well</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, although the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, the sales of the society's first editions and reprints last year broke all previous records. An average of about two new books were published every day, which can be said to have spread like wildfire. The content of each book has been greatly improved, and shallow content and incomprehensible writing have been greatly reduced.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Bizarre Murder Case Occurs on Gordon Road Yesterday Morning - Deceased is Dai Buyun from Wuxi - Head Wound Caused by Gunshot - Cause of Death Unknown <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>A bizarre shooting occurred at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning at No. 85, Lane 1000, Gordon Road (i.e., Guangming Village). According to reports from Pingming News, the deceased was Dai Buyun, a 47-year-old man from Wuxi. He had previously opened the Xingtai Printing and Paper Box Factory in his hometown, specializing in manufacturing rubber shoe boxes and gift boxes, which were sold on the market. The business was doing quite well. The factory was located in Jiangwan before the August 13th Incident.</p>
<p>It was moved here after the war. His wife has already passed away, and he has four sons and four daughters. The eldest son, named Zengshou, is 19 years old and is still studying at a middle school. The youngest child is still an infant. Household affairs are handled by the second daughter, Xuezhen (14 years old), and the maid. Dai went to bed in a room on the second floor the night before last, along with one of his youngest children. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the second daughter, Xuezhen, got up and walked into the kitchen and saw that the back door was</p>
<p>Wide Open. Suspecting that a thief had taken advantage of the opportunity to steal something and fled in a hurry, she rushed upstairs to inform her father. Pushing open the door, she caught a glimpse of blood-stained bedding. Upon closer inspection, she was shocked to discover that her father had been shot in the head, the bullet piercing through his brain from the back of his head. He lay stiff in a pool of blood, his body already cold. She cried out. The maid rushed over upon hearing the sound and was horrified by the sight. She immediately reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station. The police immediately sent detectives to inspect the scene, took fingerprints, and then transferred the body to the Jiaozhou Road Morgue. A "Pass" from the Jiangwan District was found near the deceased's body.</p>
<p>As to the Cause of His Death</p>
<p>The police are currently investigating. No. 85 is a three-story Western-style building, entirely inhabited by Dai's family. There are no other tenants. When reporters visited his home in the afternoon, all the relatives were present, their faces filled with grief. They were asked if the deceased had any enemies. Only one person seemed about to say something but was interrupted by another person who told them not to say too much. Therefore, the details remain unknown.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, Officer No. 622 of the Public Works Department's Police Force was patrolling East Hanbury Road in Hongkou when he spotted a man in a light gray long gown carrying a handgun. He immediately ordered him to stop, but the man ignored the order and turned to flee. The officer knew he was a bandit and chased after him. The bandit still tried to resist arrest, and the officer shot him in the chest and left eye. The bandit fell to the ground at the intersection of East Hanbury Road and Wuzhou Road. He was immediately apprehended. A handgun was found on him, along with 980 yuan in legal tender in his pocket. The injured thief was sent to the police hospital, where he died from his injuries shortly after. The thief was 25 or 26 years old. Before being shot, he was working with an accomplice to rob a Japanese store.</p>

<p>Miao Xiqi, a Wuxi native and owner of the Yongxing Auto Shop at No. 180 Datong Road, lives at No. 189 Meiboge Road. Last year, he adopted an 11-year-old girl from Wuxi named Xiuying. However, Miao is quite violent and often abused Xiuying. Neighbors, feeling sorry for her, secretly reported the matter to the New Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective No. 1013 from the Third Road and Western Detective Bertel to investigate. After confirming the facts, they sent Xiuying to the hospital and detained Miao Xiqi in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tiansa filed a lawsuit according to the law, stating that doctors had examined Xiuying and found bleeding in her eyes and injuries to her buttocks and legs. He asked for an interrogation. According to Xiuying's complaint, she had been repeatedly beaten by Miao for allegedly stealing and that her eye had been injured by a thrown shoe. The defendant's testimony was evasive. He hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After reviewing the evidence and hearing the arguments, the judge ruled that the defendant could be released on bail of 300 yuan to await sentencing. Xiuying was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute.</p>

On the tenth day, at 9:00 AM, Chen Boqin and the girl went to the hotel again and rented Room 45 to continue their romp. Wang Liansheng also went with them. This was discovered by Guo Xiangyao, a Chinese detective from the Huisi Police Station, who rushed to the address and arrested them, finding Chen Boqin, Wang Liansheng, and the girl Gendi in bed together, laughing and joking. Detective Guo arrested them all and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunji explained the case and requested a trial. Judge Dong questioned the defendants and ordered them to be held in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e122">New Prohibition of Storytelling <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The art of storytelling (pinghua), it's unknown when it started. It is said that those in the profession consider Zhuang Zhou as their founder, although the reason is unknown. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, people like Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, and others daily used their knowledge of subjects for amusement. It was like a clown in the play, not a narration of the past and present. New unofficial history records such as Li Guinian's ballad singing and Zheng Yuanhe selling songs were all capable of singing but did not involved direct storytelling. Only during the late Ming Dynasty, there was Liu Jingting from Jiangnan, who was good at telling ancient and modern romances, vividly depicting the situations. Whenever he told of the events involving the rebel Li Zicheng and Zuo Liangyu's southern armies, the listeners would invariably weep. He frequently socialized with gentlemen and the wealthy, and his reputation was immense. One might think that this person is what is now called a storyteller. Storytelling is known for depicting fighting and killings, while matters within women's quarters are usually omitted. Therefore, the stories told are mostly "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Romance of the Eastern Han Dynasty," "Romance of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," and so on, which have not been prohibited in the past. The customs in Hangzhou Province place great importance on storytelling. In every teahouse, there is a storytelling venue, with hundreds and thousands of listeners surrounding it. Flower drum tunes, Pinghu tunes, and the like, which involve both playing and singing, are regarded as minor stories by the people and are disdained. Since the recent new ban, no less than ten thousands people gather every day to listen to storytelling, and business has flourished because of this. There are no fewer than thirty storytelling venues in the teahouses in the city. However, a newly issued notice has suddenly been posted in the bustling market, strictly prohibiting storytelling. This is because, although storytelling narrates stories of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, it may also involve treachery, theft, and obscenity, which can corrupt the minds of the listeners. Therefore, the authorities have ordered that "Water Margin," "Investiture of the Gods," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Jin Ping Mei" be permanently banned from being performed. Furthermore, storytelling venues gather large crowds, with men and women mixed together, and criminals lurking among them. During the day, this can be slightly tolerated, but at dusk and in the middle of the night, the crowds are even more densely packed and disorderly, which is truly unacceptable. This notice was issued by the Bao'an Bureau (Security Bureau), which is indeed a measure to prevent problems before they arise.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Parricide Case: Identification Work Completed, Court Investigation Scheduled for Tomorrow Afternoon <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The sensational parricide case involving the unfilial sons Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, who murdered their father, resulted in the Shanghai First Special District Court sentencing Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang to death. Their mother, Madam Jing, was also suspected of jointly disposing of the body and was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. After the sentences were pronounced, the defendants were not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang jointly hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Yang Sicheng, and Ye Shaoying, while Madam Zhou Jing hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan, to file the appeals separately. At the same time, lawyer Yang and others argued that the Zhou brothers had a traditional mental illness, and requested the court to conduct an identification on this point. The court approved this request and appointed forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan to conduct a detailed identification. The identification work by the forensic doctors has now been completed. Therefore, the Second Branch of the High Court has scheduled a court investigation for 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month, presided over by Judge Nie Chongyi. The lawyers for the appellants have all received notification. At that time, the audience is certain to fill the courtroom.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Shortcomings of University Education <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Fang Xiaolan's "The Words of University Students" in this publication, I have endless thoughts. Indeed, the focus of the problem should be on the entirety of university education. It is certainly the fault of the average university student that they do not diligently study and immerse themselves in research, and they should be criticized for this. However, the fact that today's university education is unable to meet the needs and is unable to responsibly guide young people is also undeniable. It is naturally difficult to hope to cultivate the morality of young people and create outstanding talents under an unsound and unreasonable system. The extravagance in conduct and lack of academic cultivation of university students merely reveal a deplorable aspect of university education.</p>
<p>We seem to only see those university students from generally well-off circumstances, who spend their days in and out of restaurants and dance halls, pursuing sensual pleasures, and wasting their time and energy on useless things, while regarding studying as a form of decoration and embellishment. As a result, the impression that university students give is that of young masters in suits and leather shoes, or fashionable, permed-hair young ladies. In fact, not only in the inland areas, but also in Shanghai, there are many diligent and promising university students who study hard, and their lives are filled with blood and tears. They borrow, pawn, strive, and struggle in order to enter the gates of the university. The unsoundness and unreasonableness of university education lies here: it cannot provide as many opportunities as possible for poor and ambitious young people to study, and instead turns the sacred cause of education into a commodity, while allowing the education of the young masters and ladies who float around and are uninhibited to tarnish the dignity of education.</p>
<p>The crux of today's university education lies in the overemphasis on the transmission of lectures and the injection of knowledge, and in only knowing how to instill old experiences, while being unable to create new culture. Students are able to memorize dead provisions and formulas, and it seems that they no longer need to use active thought. Completing the prescribed credits is considered graduation, without regard for the student's actual knowledge and ability. It superficially touts the beautiful name of academic research, but does not have any connection with career activities and practical life. These pathological states presented by university education built on economic conditions are not surprising that they are given criticism.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the children of families below the middle class, although aspiring to study, can only sigh at the gates of the university; the rich young masters and ladies regard entering university as an investment to decorate their image. How can this not disappoint us?</p>
<p>Originally, the purpose of education is to help the educated to make effective adaptations to life, and to promote the continuous progress of society through the development of individual knowledge and ability. The function of university education is even more so to cultivate a beautiful personality and train specialized skills. The experiments and researches of European and American universities often directly contribute to the development of industry and commerce, which can be said to have fulfilled the mission of university education.</p>
<p>The task of the university is not only to transmit old knowledge, but should also focus on the discovery of new things and the creation of new culture. The most important thing is to provide a method of academic research as a key to unlock the treasure of culture, and at the same time cultivate a perfect life ideal and the ability to adapt to society. The weak atmosphere of academic research in today's universities is undeniable. Not to mention that there are few unique findings and inventions in a certain field of knowledge or a certain practical technique, even the systematic sorting of old experiences and the guiding of the path and methods of research science, the cultivation of students' appropriate life attitudes, and the opening of noble life ideals have not been done to a satisfactory degree, which is something that cannot but make us feel deeply regretful.</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "Save the University Students," and under the public opinion that criticizes university students, we cannot ignore the defects of today's university system itself without trying to remedy them.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Rats <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Hewa</p>
<p>It really is a kind of irony. Rats are the most similar of all animals to humans. Because humans and rats are the only omnivores. The diseases that plague humans also entangle rats. And they can survive in climates from the tropics to the poles.</p>
<p>Because humans and rats have the same diet, biologists believe that rats are the most ideal experimental animals. The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States has a specially built steel-framed building to house healthy, pure Norwegian white rats.</p>
<p>Under the management of the authoritative researcher Dr. Donaldson, ninety-six generations of white rats were raised. Their food has been scientifically tested and properly distributed; the air in the room has also been sterilized. At the same time, the institute refuses visits to prevent guests from transmitting bacteria to the rats.</p>
<p>They study the sex lives of rats in a state of fatigue; the conditions of leprosy, syphilis, tuberculosis, and pneumonia passed on to rats; the physiological effects of the amount of vitamins; the differences in blood pressure and circulatory organs between panicked rats and normal rats, among animals other than humans themselves, the scientific experimental reports on rats are the most numerous.</p>
<p>The nutritional value of food is also often determined based on rat experiments. For example, Professor McCollum's research on the effect of manganese on the human body was tested on rats. After a new drug, serum, or poison is invented, it is also used on rats to determine the medical dosage. A well-developed rat weighs about half a pound, equivalent to one two-hundred-fiftieth of an average person's weight. The appropriate dosage can be easily calculated proportionally. The use of morphine, snake venom, etc., are all first studied using white rats.</p>
<p>After a pregnancy of twenty-two or twenty-three days, the baby rats are born. Eyes closed, no hair, undeveloped limbs, short tail. Only able to cry and suckle. After ten days, they will wander around in the cage. After twenty-five days, they leave their parents. The development after that is very rapid? A white rat usually lives for three years, which is thirty times faster than the development of humans. The ninety-six generations of rats in the Wistar Institute are equivalent to 3,100 years of humans, longer than recorded history.</p>
<p>Rats are the most suitable animal for studying human genetics. Observing the situation of three generations of humans takes almost a hundred years; rats tell us the same story in eighteen months.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Poison Gas Two Thousand Years Ago <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Fangren</p>
<p>Everyone thought that the use of poison gas as a weapon of war began in the last World War. However, unknown to people, it had already been used two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>According to the records of the ancient Greek historian Thucydides in "History of the Peloponnesian War," when the Spartans besieged the city of Plataea in 470 BC, they tried to smoke out the defenders with smoke. Their method was to pile bundles of firewood around the city mound, soak the firewood with sulfur and tar, and then light it to produce thick smoke. However, this time they failed because the wind changed direction and the smoke smoked themselves, so they had to retreat.</p>
<p>Later, in 428 BC, they besieged Plataea again using the same method, and this time they succeeded. However, although they conquered the enemy because of this, they never knew that the death of the enemy was not only because of the smoke, but also because of the toxic gas – carbon monoxide – produced by the combined burning of sulfur and tar.</p>
<p>The Spartan method of burning sulfur and tar was also widely used in the Middle Ages, the Roman Empire, and the Renaissance, but they still did not know the real reason for its killing effect. Seeing that the mixture of sulfur and tar could burn on the surface of the water, they miraculously called it "Greek Fire."</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century, the Arab historian Abramah also suggested using opium gas to defeat the enemy. And in the military library in Berlin, there is an ancient book from 1437 that contains a method for manufacturing poison gas bombs. From this formula, it can be known that it actually contains arsenic trisulfide.</p>
<p>The history of poison gas ends here. This is not to say that human beings suddenly paid attention to humanity and showed great compassion, but in reality, it was still because there was no better method of application. Because the distance was not far, they were also in danger of poisoning.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, there were more and more inventions. For example, during the French Revolution, the French army used it once based on the experiments of a chemist named Fourcroy. During the Napoleonic era, a British chemist also contributed the secret method of making cyanide gas bombs to Napoleon, but Napoleon refused to use it. In 1912, the Hague International Conference decided to prohibit the use of poison gas, except for tear gas, which was not included in the ban because it did not cause serious harm.</p>
<p>It was not until the end of October 1914 that the German army violated the prohibition of the Hague Conference and used chlorine gas in the Rhine, and then the Allied forces also followed suit. However, in the beginning, it was very weak and failed repeatedly. According to statistics, in three and a half years, the German army used a total of 47,500 tons of poison gas, and 57,000 French soldiers were poisoned. And 27% of the losses of the American Expeditionary Force were also due to poison gas. As a result, the military status of poison gas was established.</p>
<p>After the war, the research on poison gas by various countries has become even more alarming. Fortunately, until now, no country has used it on a large scale, otherwise, in this year-on-year war, I don't know how many millions of new ghosts would have been added.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Wife's Hair <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Jinchuan</p>
<p>I am a poor scholar who makes a living by selling manuscripts. Three years ago, I borrowed money to get married. Fortunately, I have no children, so the burden is lighter. But living a life of eating one meal and starving the next, barely surviving on the poverty line, is really endless. However, my wife nags every day, sighs and complains, and quarrels at the slightest dissatisfaction. This kind of problem can only be cured with money, so I desperately write manuscripts. But manuscripts are not worth much these days, and sometimes they are rejected. Borrowing from friends is only possible once or twice, and there is no hope of opening my mouth again next time! It really is "misfortune that always surrounds me." But apart from the problem of eating, at least "housing" is thanks to the favor of relatives; a small room built on the sun deck costs ten yuan a month, which is not expensive. As for "clothing," the few uniforms I had when I was in school can barely pass muster. But my wife's clothes must be constantly renewed. She doesn't want to wear long sleeves, she wants short sleeves; if the color is a bit old, she doesn't want to wear it either. If I open my mouth to object, she says others are doing this and that. It really forces me to groan in misery. Next is the problem of hair. For this matter, we have to argue at least twice a month. For example, the day before she goes to meet her girlfriend, she is sure to start a fuss about getting her hair permed. I say, "Natural hair is beautiful." She says, "Everyone else is permed. If I don't perm it, it's hard to meet people. Even Bing Sheng's wife, who works in a factory, has permed it. Humph, as a husband, you should be ashamed to see your wife go out with messy hair." So we quarrel again, and in the end, I have to give her the money to get it permed to end the argument. When she comes back, a few days' worth of food has been exchanged for a head full of curls. Seeing it makes me laugh and angry at the same time!</p>
<p>Therefore, for me, my wife's hair is a serious problem. If I unfortunately (a laugh) have a few more daughters, that would be terrible. The money I make from writing can only be used for a month of perms. My stomach will start to go hungry, and I might even become a starved corpse because of hair. Thinking of this makes me shudder.</p>
<p>In addition to lamenting, I hope that the fashionable young ladies and mistresses will reduce their expenses, or not perm their hair and change to a style that doesn't cost money. This would also save us who wear long gowns and work hard, people with wives and daughters who are overly concerned with appearances. Then the merit would be immeasurable!</p>
<h3 id="e128">How to Learn <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwen</p>
<p>All knowledge comes from learning. The more you learn, the richer your knowledge. Conversely, nothing can progress. If you don't advance, you will regress, and you may even lose what you have learned. This shows how precious learning is. However, if you only know it is precious and do not know how to learn, then the harvest will definitely be small. Therefore, I have set out a few basic principles of learning here. Please keep them firmly in mind during the learning process. This can help you learn the most and progress the fastest:</p>
<p>First, you must seize time.</p>
<p>Second, you must have perseverance and regularity.</p>
<p>Third, you must have confidence, determination, and a tenacious spirit.</p>
<p>Fourth, you must be humble.</p>
<p>Fifth, you must have a high degree of self-motivation. (Moved from the Orphaned Army)</p>

<p>— Jingzheng</p>
<p>The UK is currently spending approximately six million pounds per day on the war. Sir Simon estimates that this day's expenses could be used for the following purposes:</p>
<p>(1) To provide all unemployed men and women in the UK with five pounds a day, or 1,825 pounds a year. (2) To provide retirees with a pension of two pounds a day.</p>
<p>(3) To clear the debts owed by the London County Council in two weeks.</p>
<p>(3) This huge sum could allow shipyards to build three cruisers a day.</p>
<p>(4) The UK's annual fire losses could be fully compensated for in one day with this money.</p>

<h3 id="e130">An Interesting Question: Do Hollywood Stars Know Each Other? <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Jieni</p>
<p>Do you think Claudette Colbert and Marlene Dietrich are good friends? Or do you believe that Tyrone Power and Robert Taylor know each other well?</p>
<p>This is indeed an interesting and difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>Although they are all big stars who don't need introductions when they meet; although they are all in the same big family - Hollywood; in fact, this big family is not very happy, with all kinds of competition and displeasure, so it is not surprising that stars do not interact with each other.</p>
<p>Once, Claudette Colbert and Zassu Pitts lived next door to each other for three years and never met or spoke a word to each other. A year later, they were both actors at Paramount. One day, they happened to meet at the company. They smiled at each other and shook hands, and only then did they begin to get to know each other.</p>
<p>Another time, Constance Bennett and Claudette Colbert were waiting in the waiting room of a hospital at the same time. Apart from meeting on the screen, they had never met each other before, so they did not dare to greet each other. Later, they took the movie magazines on display in the room and flipped through them, and they both discovered that the other's photos really looked like the other person. So Claudette mustered up the courage to introduce herself:</p>
<p>"Hi, I'm in the movies, my name is Claudette."</p>
<p>"My name is Constance," the other person replied.</p>
<p>Then, the two of them laughed loudly. From then on, they talked very warmly and enthusiastically until the doctor called them inside. When Claudette met [Norma Shearer], after the hostess introduced them to each other, both of them wanted to say "I've heard so much about you," but they found it difficult to start the conversation. So they first talked about the movies they had seen recently. Then Claudette told Norma that she admired her very much, and Norma replied by praising Claudette as a great artist.</p>
<p>From the above examples, it seems that although Hollywood stars know each other's names, even if they often meet or live next door, if there is no accidental chance, they may never get to know each other in their lives.</p>
<h3 id="e131">On the Public Charity Concert <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Meixian</p>
<p>Every spring and autumn, concerts become the most active artistic trend in Shanghai. Harmonica groups are of course no exception. The Public Harmonica Society's concert was held the night before last at the auditorium of Aurora University.</p>
<p>The Public Harmonica Society is led by harmonica player Mr. Shi Renwang. He held a charity concert last autumn, which was well-received. This concert is also of a charitable nature, entertaining and not forgetting disaster relief. We should express our respect to this person who is engaged in popular music.</p>
<p>The musical program the night before last was entirely performed by members of the Public Harmonica Society. The opening was the "Raymond Overture," a large ensemble. Following that was Mr. Li Yinting's harmonica solo "Wilhelm Tell Overture," and the "Era Military Officer March" large ensemble. The audience seemed to have a great affection for the march, and expressed great welcome.</p>
<p>"The Dove" and "Wild Dance" were played by Shi Renwang, Shi Hailun, Zhu Rongshi, Cai Qilin and other four gentlemen with four accordions. "Light Cavalry" is a world-famous piece, now played by Gong Yuxiang and Tang Zhihui with small harmonicas, which can express many advantages. "Lily Waltz" is also a well-known piece of music, played with excellent technique. Miss Shi Hailun's ensemble harmonica solo is said to be the first public performance of the ensemble harmonica by a Chinese woman. She played "Sailor's Whistle" and "Tales from the Vienna Woods," which won great acclaim. "The Public Harmonica Society Song" is adapted from the famous song "Xichun Gui (Regret for Spring)," with singing added in the middle, which is also very unique.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Recent News of Mei Lanfang in Hong Kong <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>The international drama artist Mei Lanfang is living in seclusion in Hong Kong. His face is covered with a short beard, and it seems that he has no intention of returning to the stage. However, he is still very concerned about the art.</p>
<p>One day, he visited the filming of "Striking the Fishing Boat" in Southern Guangdong. He praised Lu Ming's portrayal of Xiao Guiying, believing that she had the shyness and dignity that a girl should have in ancient times.</p>
<p>When asked about his opinion on domestic films, he said that he had recently watched "Peerless Beauty" and found it generally quite good, but some aspects, such as the wind roaring without dust blowing, seemed to be lacking. He also mentioned many technical issues in directing, showing that he is quite knowledgeable about film.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's acceptance of Wang Xichun as his disciple has already been held at the Repulse Bay Hotel. Mei said to people, "Although Xichun's figure and acting skills have not yet reached perfection, she has no bad habits. Her voice is inherently narrow, but it is not impossible to improve." Now Xichun goes to Mei's residence for vocal exercises around 5 pm every day. It is said that Xichun is the first female disciple Mei has accepted. Although Mei's wife, Fu Zhifang, also received guidance from Mei in the past, she soon married Mei.</p>

<p>Ma Lianliang's Square Back Flags in Lintong Mountain (Middle)</p>
<p>For any newly invented thing, one must first consider its meaning. Drama is an art of beauty, so the newly created costumes must consider aesthetics and convenience in addition to meaning. Lianliang is originally unlearned, and those who cater to him only seek to please the audience with novelty. Thus, this incongruous dragon and tiger armor and square back flags appeared in the play "Lintong Mountain." Little did they know that Chinese drama is praised worldwide for its "symbolic" nature. If everything strives for realism, then the value of Chinese drama is lost. For example, the armor worn by military generals was originally made of iron and leather, and was used to protect the body against the enemy. The armor is composed of three parts connected together. The part that resembles a cape is called the shoulder guard, the part that is attached to the chest is called the breastplate, and the parts that hang down on both sides are called the leg guards. Although they are all made of iron leaves, their weight is also forty to fifty pounds. In drama, the shape is imitated with satin and decorated with brocade, and it is called "kao" (armor). Except for the leg guards (insiders call this "kao paizi"), the upper and middle parts are connected as one, and the lower part of the "kao du" (the middle part called the breastplate) is longer than the real one, purely for lightness and beauty. If it were really made of iron leaves, I am afraid that even Yu Runxian, who is superhuman in strength, would find it difficult to show his good skills in "Changban Slope." Also, the armor is divided into soft and hard types. The hard armor has a leather seat on the back to insert the four-sided back flags, while the soft armor does not. The original intention of the back flags was that when generals fought on horseback, they could take any one of the command flags to issue orders. The number did not have to be four, and the shape did not have to be square. In the early years, I saw that the Bangzi troupes used eight back flags. Later, Xia Yuerun, a martial arts actor in Shanghai, also used them once, but in the end, they felt cumbersome and not elegant. Therefore, for many years, the triangular four-sided back flags have been unanimously adopted by the performing arts circle.</p>
