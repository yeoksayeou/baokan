<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國建造大海軍的意義</h3>
<p>在美國議會開會期中，值得我們注意的消息，是海軍委員會要員，向議會要求撥款二十萬萬美金，充實美國大西洋艦隊。據說此項意見，代表議會中大多數人的意見，而其所以有這要求的原因，乃由於（一）世界危機，日趨嚴重，為保障拉丁美洲各共和國的安全，避免可能的外來侵略，美國有充實國防的必要；（二）美國如欲避免世界戰爭，有充分實力保障新世界的安全，不問在太平洋方面抑在大西洋方面，都需有防禦力量充分的艦隊，美國在太平洋的海軍實力，旣有二百萬噸，則在大西洋方面至少需有三分之二的實力，始克擔當防衛：（三）過去英美兩國保持有一種「不成文」的默契，即英國雄厚的海軍實力爲大西洋防禦的第一綫；而美國的雄厚海軍爲防守太平洋的第一綫。但因目前英國有事於歐洲，自然欲英國在大西洋中盡其以往的任務，已不可能，而未來局勢的變幻，尤不可測。更有一因素，使美國有增加大西洋艦隊的必要者，是歐洲海軍强國與亞洲海軍强國聯合對美的威脅是也。這裏所指出的歐洲海軍强國，究竟對那一個國家而言，無從推測，而所謂亞洲海軍强國，必然爲日本無疑。</p>
<p>這種龐大的海軍建設程序，旣由美國議會發動，其能否爲委員會所可決而更通過於議會，目前自尚有待。就美國現在行政當局的政策講，美國總統羅斯福氏在彼海軍次長任內，即已有聲有色，他素來主張大海軍政策，遇有機會。就想把美國海軍成爲世界上最强的力量。自他就任總統以來，早已有好幾度海軍擴張計劃的進行。在一九三三年，他曾撥緊急基金二三八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美金，建造軍艦三十二艘，這軍艦的最後一批，已於一九三八年完成。美國議會於一九三四年的文生—屈美勒案中，通過法令，使美國造艦，達到華盛頓海軍條约中限制的最高限度。根據這法案，美國擬造九十四艘軍艦，其中四十五艘業經完工，已在服役中，而另外四十五艘，則正在建造。一九三八年的海軍擴充案，也規定建造軍艦三十四艘，但至少須至一九四四年然後始能完成。故自一九三三年羅斯福氏就任以來，預定建造的軍艦，共有一百七十九艘，內中已完工的，只有八十九艘，而尚在建造中，仍有九十艘。</p>
<p>現在美國如果再要擴展大西洋艦隊，而其標準要在達到在兩大洋中的海軍，都能單獨作戰，壓倒世界其他國家，則估計此二十萬萬美金的海軍擴張軍費，可以建造戰鬥艦十二艘，航空母艦六艘。重巡洋艦十七艘，輕巡洋艦十八艘，驅逐艦潛艇各三十六艘，及五十三艘的補助艦隊。拿美國造船工業每年平均出產十五艘的速率來計算，則大西洋龐大海軍艦隊的建造完成，至少須十年的時間。美國主要敵人，足以威脅美國安全；今從海軍委員會要員之所指述，可以說不是歐洲的却是亞洲的海軍强國。這亞洲海軍强國，早在對中國進行侵略，這侵略如果不停止，而美國對於這海軍强國的侵略，自始供給以原料，助長其氣燄，或則更不幸如美國某報所指出『日本將來可利用中國成爲一大軍火工廠，及人力的儲存所，而對西方文明將有所危害，』那末到了那時，美國雖有雄視一切的大海軍，恐亦不能應付這個侵略國家所加於美國自身的威脅了。</p>
<p>完成這一次的擴大海軍案，需時十年，雖對於最近的威脅，不無遠水近火之感，然其必要與價值，當然不因十年而减低。但我們同時感念於目前的美國，在物質上與道德上的力量，如中國外交部長王寵惠氏所謂對於遠東的命運，發生決定的影響。而現在也就是發揮這樣偉大武器的最適當的時機。溯念自中日事變以來，日本向美購買的主要作戰資料，如汽油，碎鐵，銅，汽車和飛機等達三萬二千六百萬元，而日貨輸入美國者，僅就去年歐戰前八個月而論，平均每月的值日金三千九百四十萬元，歐戰後增加更多，每月平均的佔七千九百萬元。日本的國際收支，賴美國的貿易，以資挹注的，實屬不小。轉瞬日美商約即告期滿，開會中的美國議員，如果周詳考慮怎樣使用這新武器，對於一切軍需的輸出，加以禁止，對於在商的不續訂後的貿易，不予以優惠的待遇，那末，對於制止侵略所收的效果，及美國將來的安全保障，並不下於龐大的軍艦的建造。節省大量的海軍費用，猶其餘事！</p>

<p>東京　阿部首相於八日午後臨時閣議開會之前、先與畑陸相及吉田海相作個別會談、就政局問題探詢兩相之意見、作重要談話、又永井遞相·秋田厚相·亦於閣議散會後、留待於首相官邸、與阿部首相會晤、詳細報告政黨方面情形、並就其對策、交換種種意見、（八日同盟電）</p>

<h3>孫科返國抵渝　縱談戰時歐洲觀感　各國輿論對於中國表示同情　稱抗戰足代表人類最高文明</h3>
<p>重慶航訊、立法院院長孫科、於二十八年一月間啣命赴蘇聯、幷歷訪歐洲各國朝野、歷時十月、始由法啟程返國、日前經昆明乘機安抵此間、當即往訪蔣委員長晤談、昨晨幷出席中央國府聯合紀念週、報告此行觀感、記者頃訪孫院長於某處、承以歐洲各種情勢見告、類多於中國抗戰前途有利、爰略紀如次、</p>
<p>歐洲各國報紙對中國抗戰最注意者、莫如蘇聯、蘇聯大小各報、每日有極多篇幅、登載中國抗戰消息、且登載時必佔極顯著之地位、如湘北大捷消息、一經傳至蘇聯、第二日各大報皆以最顯著地位刋載、上次參政會蔣總裁訓詞、亦全文登載、惟在九月十六·十七·十八·三日中、少登中國消息、因那幾天全蘇報紙、滿登出兵波蘭消息、其後則仍　舊觀、蘇聯是在如何關心中國抗戰、此點希望中國與論界特別注意、蘇聯對中國抗戰的同情與援助、大家應當好自珍重、在蘇聯看歐局是很淸楚的、蘇聯對遠東政策、決無變化、</p>
<p>目前歐洲大戰開始後的英法情形、有許多很可供我們做參考的、英法兩國城市中、現在到下午五時、路上行人即漸稀、晚間燈火管制、絕對嚴密、不但店舖不開門、不點燈、即街燈亦全部滅熄、必要時、室內點燈、則須掩罩上極厚的簾幔、英國開戰後、運往法國前方的陸軍、共十五萬人、運輸設置甚週到、運輸經過、沒有傷一個人、但是在防空初期、黑夜路上汽車撞死的人、全國在一個月中、已有三千五百餘人、英國對德宣佈戰事的那一天、巴立門正在開會、即有空襲警報聲、全體議員、因忽忙避入防空室、誰知半小時後、却證明是一塲虛驚、據防空司令部報告、係當初天空發現不明國籍之飛機、後來確定爲本國飛機云云、同時、倫敦的防空設備、因地下室不易多建、普通人民、只好多到地道車隧道中躱避、不過大店舖玻璃窗門前皆巳堆集有沙包了、</p>
<p>巴黎防空情形、與倫教稍異、沙包在各店舖前、未見堆有、僅凱旋門四週堆集甚多、意在保護彫刻美術、巴黎街市、冷落多了、咖啡館的坐客、亦較平時大减倫敦·巴黎·晚間路上旣無燈　、亦無行人、比較我們南京在　事初起時還遠不如、</p>
<p>法在戰事初起時、許多措置、相當表現慌亂、倫敦市政府、會下令微用全市旅館房問三千餘間、幷將所住旅客全數逐出、嗣戰事經過一月餘、許多徵用的房間、皆空閉不用、市民爲之譁然、但市政府解釋說、初意戰端一開、德國飛機必來大轟炸、倫敦必須凖備三十萬人的床位救護、可幸德國却沒有照這計劃做、有次、德機炸愛丁堡附近海港、當地居民見英國大隊飛機起飛、以爲本國飛機演習、羣衆聚集瞻望、一會兒、機槍炸彈齊下、方知是德機來襲、但防空部未發出警報、引起市民的責備、倫敦此次疎散人口、甚爲敏捷、一百幾十萬兒童、幾天內就疎散完畢、在倫敦附近鄕村家庭中、看每家的情形、把小孩子分別寄養、編號登記、可是小孩子寄養在人家、旣無人管理、亦不能讀書、每一鄕村中、寄養的小孩、結隊成羣、變了無管束的小天使世界、後經家長們提出異議、於是各小學跟着分散到鄕問、敎師分頭梭巡街巷、看見小孩便三五個抓去上課、輪流敎讀、家長們到星期去看小孩、小孩子哭哭啼啼、不肯再住鄕間、父母只得帶領回城、所以倫敦疎散的人口、一月後又悉數回城了、</p>
<p>英國輿論對這决大戰所標榜的態度、似乎頗與我國抗戰意義相同、有一次、邱吉爾海相廣播演說、詞意頗像我們蔣委員長抗戰以來所發表的論調、後邱吉爾的孫院長談話、孫院長劈頭就對他說、「你前幾天的廣播、辭意與中國兩年來所說及蔣委員長所講的完全相同、」邱吉爾答稱、「本來我們這次戰爭性質、與你們相同、同是抵抗侵略、」路易喬治今年七十八歲了、他談起歐局、對英國數年來的當局、憤憤不平、說這次戰事、是數年來當局軟弱的結果、他與邱吉爾數年前皆建議政府、主張英國積極帮助中國抗戰、英國一般輿論及社會中堅對中國的抗戰、都一致羨慕、他們同聲稱讚、「中國打了兩年半、日本吞不了中國、中國已經勝利了、」英國人覺得中國是世界惟一光榮而極有希望之地、英國繼續維持遠東政策、是政府社會一致的信條、路易喬治還說、「中國的抗戰、不但代表正義的力量、且代表人類最高的文明」、有一次、孫院長與一位貴族靑年共飯、那位靑年酒酣、說做英國人煩悶極了、他情願到中國來居住投効、他有一點技能、他是學森林管理、還能做木工、第三者對我抗戰必勝前途、重視如此、我們應愈堅定信心、以求早日貫澈其目的、</p>
<p>歐洲各國戰時的組織、幷不如一般人想像之完密、歐洲人對戰爭是厭倦極了、法國有一位八十餘歲的老太太、她一生已親見三次戰爭了、普法之戰、是她的丈夫參加、上决大戰、是她兒子參加、現在是孫子參加、美國有位記者最近著有一書、提倡世界聯邦制度、主要點是把世界十個民主國聯合起來、就可不怕强暴侵略、歐洲各國思想界、對這一種言論、極感興趣、歐洲人怕戰爭、說戰爭之源、爲道德進步、跟不上物質科學殺人器具的進步、歐洲戰爭方起、一般人思想上與上决歐戰結束時已相似、尤其中立小國處境最苦、他們眞是命在旦夕、不由自主、</p>

<h3>費利浦案發生後　外僑抱嚴重見解　預料必判明案情而後已　兇犯三人至今仍無着落　滬西一帶加强警力</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局總辦費利浦氏、於本月六日晨由海格路寓所赴局途中、遭暴徒狙擊案發生後、租界當局、對越界築路地帶之警力、七日起已大加增强、意軍防區、其鄰近越界築路處、過去僅二三名巡邏者、前日起、巳增遞至元名七名不等、租界當局爲求偵緝兇犯、於出事後之翌日、增加中·西·印·探捕、除在接近越界築路地段梭巡戒備外、復於界內逐一檢查行人、租界當局、現繼續要求交出兇犯、據悉該狙擊費氏之三人、已在西區海格路附近槍擊地點之某村、業已拘獲、但日憲兵當局對英軍司令西蒙斯少將之抗議、據稱堅掙並未有暴徒捕得、據另一報告、槍擊案件發生於海格路與法租界福開森路間、是晨先後竟開槍十發之多、其中八槍擊中費氏之車身、中一彈竟擊中費氏車廂坐位之右面靠背、費氏得以脫險、亦云幸矣、公共租界警務處現在費氏私寓、採取特殊戒備、並派中西探員、受費氏支配、用資保護、</p>
<p>兇犯三人迄未交出</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、「歹土」當局、雖已於星期六日向公共租界警務處承認捕獲圖刺費利浦之暴徒三人、但今對三暴徒究在何處、拒不發表任何消息、甚且以未獲兇犯爲言、工部局警務處英軍當局·與英總領署、均已要求合作緝兇、迄無效果、據悉被捕三人、今在極司非而路九十四號日憲兵司令部、警務處人員、曾於星期六日前往「大道」警局要求警長交出三人、該警長先稱未知逮捕事、繼與外間通電話三次、轉向工部局警務處人員聲稱、已捕獲持有盒子砲者三人、但不能移交、因三人非「大道」警察所捕獲云、其後警務處企圖拘押三人到案、均無效果、</p>
<p>外籍人士認為嚴重</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、據可靠消息、工部局對於總辦兼總裁費利溥上星期六日晨遭暴徒狙擊案、將向領事團與其他負資當局、提出詳細報告、本市高級外籍人士均認此案甚爲嚴重、預料不致准許此事擱置、必待捕獲暴徒判明案情而後已、</p>
<p>預料各方即將討論</p>
<p>一般人對此案幕後動機、頗多揣測、警務處雖稱兇犯三名被海格路某衖賭塲保鑣捕獲、解送該處警局轉押極司非而路九十四號日憲兵司令部、今仍被禁其中、惟日方則稱完全不知此事、預料各方當局將早日談話、討論此案、</p>
<p>暗殺企圖計畫周密</p>

<h3>善團聯合會今晚起　提前施賑饅首　每晚在龍門路附近散發　費用仍望各界隨時捐助</h3>

<p>施賑麥粉饅首辦法</p>

<p>隱貧人士秘密救濟</p>
<p>該會又鑒於上海百物騰漲、柴米價格、尤爲昂貴、中等以下家庭、以米珠薪桂、度日艱難者、所在多有、惟爲顧全顏面、不惜借貸典質、挖肉醫瘡、此種隱貧之人、心境之愁苦、較赤貧爲尤甚、據大通社記者探悉、該會現正籌劃救濟辦法、其方法亦從隱秘着手、或由親友代向報吿、或本人逕函該會陳述、並得化名、至該會辦理上項救濟事宜、絕對嚴守秘密、</p>

<h3>閘北江淡吳淞　地產主權旁落　日方「恒產公司」劃「建設區」　圈用面積廣大業主無法過問</h3>
<p>日方投資組織之「上海恒產公司」、去歲開辦以來積極强圈民地、造屋貿利、近更雇用日籍監工數十名、督同大批無知華籍小工、拆掘墳墓、尸骨狼藉、慘不忍覩、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>「建設區」强圈民地</p>
<p>所謂「上海恒產公司」、爲日方半官性質之牟利機關、上年取得日方特務機關同意、在閘北江灣吳淞一帶、劃出廣大土地、名曰「建設區域」、在其規定區域內之地產、不論屬於何人所有、一律加以圈收、因戰後人民大多流亡於外、該公司乃得任所欲爲、無從加以理會、即有少數貧民、不得已回鄉、見家屋與地產均被圈用、無法居住、如輾轉設法委托有勢力者前往中說、則由該「公司」任意估算最低地價、給以不兌現之文據一紙、仍分文未得、設或無人帮忙、則其業產即遭喪失、</p>
<p>偽土地局無法過問</p>
<p>僞「土地局鑒於上項情形、任意强制沒收人民土地、亦爲不妥、且該「恒產公司」圈用民地時、置僞「局」僞「政府」於不顧、絕不通知、偽「土地局」以爲損害其權利、曾於去歲迭次派員向「恒產公司」婉詞磋商、要求於該公司圈收民地之前、先於手續上取得僞局同意、詎恒產公司對於此項要求、置之不理、故該公司之一舉一動、偽局無法加以過問、</p>
<p>小工貪利掘墓拆棺</p>
<p>恒產公司經一年來之經營、已在閘北江灣吳淞一帶、擇原來熱鬧市區、先行建屋、以便出租牟利、此外其較爲荒僻之被圈土地、近亦加以整理、並派日人「監督」數十名、督同數百無知華工、每日分往各處發掘墳墓、遷移浮厝尸棺、此輩工人、更喪心病在、以爲棺柩內常有遺留尸屬所藏之金屬品、故視棺墓較佳者、與「監督」等狼狽爲奸、任意打開棺木檢尋、致尸棺凌亂、或竟狼藉滿地、江灣鎭四週鄕間、爲害殊烈、</p>
<p>蕰藻浜地產被圈用</p>

<h3>集團購米與平糶　平糶辦法僅能救濟暫時惟集團訂米有自衛意義</h3>
<p>— 蕢延芳</p>
<p>溯自本市米價飛漲以來、其影響於社會之秩序及租界之治安甚大、凍餒者愍不畏法、鋌而走險、搶米路刦、時有發生、而薪水階級、在生活上亦大受威脅、於是商店公司及工廠之職工、要求加薪、解决生活而怠工、勞資相持、糾紛疊出、人心恐惶、社會不安、在目前各地豐收、新穀甫登、已釀成如此嚴重之形勢、倘至將來靑黃不接之時、則本市四百萬市民、恐有斷炊之虞、其危險更何堪設想耶、延芳以爲在此時期、非認淸目標、羣策羣力、籌定辦法、則不能解决此嚴重問題、故於去歲十二月間、商請虞洽老及各工商界領袖、組織上海市民食調節協會、同時延芳在各報發表調節上海民食方案之蒭議、關於訂購辦法、言之綦詳、幸此議爲各界所贊同、於是由協會籌集基金一百萬元、並確定其用途爲購洋米調劑市面之用、而該項基金、俟協會解散時、照購米平市所受之損失比例攤還、法美意善、此實調節民食最有效之方法也、旬日之間、各界之集團購米者、蠭起雲湧、咸向協會登記、而上海之米市、亦稍稍穩定矣、</p>
<p>最近有人主張辦理平糶、以資救濟、倘能兼顧並進、事亦可行、惟集團購米係目前調節民食之要策、未可偏廢、更應積極推行、以竟全功、蓋集團購米、爲治本辦法、辦理平糶、爲治標辦法、性質有殊、功效自異、</p>
<p>一、集團購米之目的爲未雨綢繆之計、以防米荒、由商號工廠學校等、視其食米需要之數量、出資預購外、另再購存十萬包洋米、存儲安全棧內、萬一米價再行飛漲、以此十萬包之米、原本出售、則市面當可壓平、而投機者之操縱、更無所用其技、如此、則米價自易降落、惟存米十萬包一經出售後、仍須立即補購足數、務使倉有存儲、有恃無恐、無論如何、有此十萬包存糧、自無米荒之虞、壓平市價尤其餘事也、此爲消費者本身着想、而含有經濟上自衛行動之意義焉、</p>
<p>二、辦理平糶固亦爲調劑民食之一法、目前上海居民、以四百萬計、其中勞動貧苦者階級、至少佔三百萬人、倘籌集一百萬元、辦理平糶、則每人平均所得僅值國幣三角許之食米、此戔戔之數、何濟於事、如欲籌千萬元之巨款、事實上不易辦到、况平糶係慈善性之事、而非根本辦法、至於辦理平糶之手續不嚴、則弊竇百出、過嚴則施惠不廣、猶憶去歲九月間、上海難民救濟會、曾在公共租界及法租界舉辦平糶、糴米人多、擁擠不堪、跌傷失物、時有所聞、且婦女老弱、鵠立終日、往往無一米之獲、强暴者捷足先登、常有逾分之得、聞此次平糶、在兩租界共設五十所平糶處、雖擁擠可免、但是否能普遍施惠、而使大多數貧民、無向隅之感、誠堪注意之問題也、</p>
<p>三、集團訂購洋米、基金本定爲一百萬元、今因各業認繳踴躍、增爲二百萬元、可見此事與一般市民生計有密切關係、故能獲大衆之擁護、且此項基金之運用、生生不息、循環購米、可以長期壓平市面、使操縱者無居奇之機會、上海民食之解決、於此是賴、其利之普、貧富均霑、非僅如平糶僅爲消極之辦法、受益者限於局部之人、且爲時甚暫也、</p>
<p>四·集團訂購洋米、其基金全俟米價跌平、恢復常態、而協會結束之後、除扣必不可免之損失外、仍發還與原繳人、較諸辦平糶所募之基金、僅爲一種慈善性質之佈施、大相逕庭、且集團購米、壓平市面、係在大多數市民生活上謀保障、倘目前不預爲之備、則他日食米羅掘殆盡之時、雖倍蓰其值、無由購得、則將來上海市民之生計、社會之安寗、能否長此維持、更難逆料、至於平糶、雖能救濟一時、然對於整個市民之關係、固不若此之深且切也、</p>
<p>總之、爲社會舉辦公益之事、應犧牲小我之私利、謀君衆之福利、或謂此次舉辦平糶與集團購米、均以調解民食爲歸依、目的相同、事可並行而不悖、何必强分彼此、實則無論何事、其措置有先後輕重之分、未可等量齊觀、平糶雖然能調劑民食、然爲效甚微、而所施之利亦寡、至於集團購米、爲將來市民生活之保障、凡我工商學各界及經濟能力足以自給之市民、均應負積極訂購之責、或恐一般市民、眩於平糶之美名、而忘集團購米之利益、怠於推進、則將來本身自食其果、追悔莫及、故延芳不憚於費辭、而爲本市社會人士告也、</p>
<h3>國貨團體籲請　自由裝運</h3>
<p>應予甄別分淸涇渭　滬市產銷急需發展</p>
<p>經濟部為增進戰時生產起見、對於非禁運之土貨出口、及完全國貨進口、迭經與有關係各機關縝密研究、擬具辦法、經呈准軍事委員會、對於各游擊區內之國貨產品、在內地一律禁運進口、惟關於上海租界以內之華商工廠出品、經查明確屬實際國貨者、准予進口外、對已製成之物品、一概不准進口、該部業已電達各市政府飭屬知照、並由財政部通飭全國各海關遵照辦理、本市各國貨工廠、以際此非常時期、其中一部份工廠、名雖國貨、而其原料則大多採用國外各國、惟大多數工廠則仍竭力採用國貨原料、况在此工商各業感受苦悶之際、各地遭受無形封鎖、國貨內銷本屬不易、若再禁止國貨運入內地、則滬市國貨事業將遭嚴重打擊、爰經本市各國貨團體往返接洽結果、決呈請當局詳述處境苦衷、應予分淸涇渭、甄別辦理、籲請收回成命、自由裝運國貨內銷、藉維整個國貨市塲、况在此抗戰未已之時、自應增加生產、向國內外發展、</p>
<h3>煤價昂漲　影響工業</h3>

<h3>感情强熾的女子　不可擅行禁慾</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>縱慾之害，盡人皆知，而不知禁慾亦有其害在也。以女子言，性慾之微弱者，禁慾殆無何種困難。故能一生守其獨身生活，純潔無瑕。其於身心上亦無何種疾病。其反是者，身體旣甚健康，性慾又常發動，若尚未與異性接觸，則禁慾尚可勉强施行，不至發生疾病，若少年時代，性好交際，或喜閱淫猥之書籍，或已與異性發生交接。則禁慾之結果，必致發生神經病，患歇斯的里者，大率由此。若强其禁慾，則每不顧一切，取自動地位，以漁色男子，此皆禁慾之反動，不足爲怪也，故凡感情强熾之女子，決不可擅行禁慾。</p>
<p>又凡女子一旦忽遭不幸，或失愛於夫，或其夫遠遊不返，因之憂愁苦悶，而引起種種的疾病，故此等女子，最爲悲慘。</p>
<p>上述的原因而使女子强行禁慾者，社會上常數見不鮮。但尚有較此更悲慘之事，使女子喪失性的享樂者，厥爲男子的腎虧多病，房事無能，常患早洩陰萎等症。故夫婦間愛情不良，常起勃谿，甚之妻子不耐悽凉，而發生姦通之事，醜名四佈，此不僅女子失却夫婦之樂，而男子自身亦覺樂趣全無，此誠重要之家庭問題也。</p>
<p>據德國醫學專家之調查，房事不力之男子，十人中恒佔半數，今欲治療此種疾病，除在婚前防免自凟，婚後亦應節慾，蓋性機能的作用，旣不能曠，又不能縱，縱慾之後，勢必腎虧，床第之歡，難生情愛，故爲求雙方之幸福計，腎虧男子速應治療，如不遵醫師指導濫服市上春藥，及類似春藥之補劑，不僅絕無功效，反增病變，故唯有內服眞正雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」能使增精補血，健腦固腎，使早洩陰萎，遺精滑精等症，短期告痊，此在吾輩醫師臨床實騐上久著成績，樂願介紹於病家，免得多情之女子，因丈夫之腎虧而致家庭失歡，此「補體康」所以備受醫藥兩界的推崇，遠非劣藥所可比擬，其女用有調經種子之功，藥房均售。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>以鐵的事實證明　白濁之易治</h3>
<p>許多舊時代之淋病內服藥及其療法，旣經現代專家醫師，及病家證明其無效，故新療法之研究，甚囂塵上，學者埋首工作耗盡無數心血與腦力，卒由試騐管中，發見一種治淋眞理。而一時震撼全世界的醫壇，咸認爲治淋病上最大之收穫。時余方負笈美利堅。攻讀醫學。乃銳意研究，博覽各國所出版之醫學雜誌，乃知係根據最新科學之新方法，將提製純凈之色素與蛋白體侶以其他精純而具强力殺菌之化學藥品，製爲溶液，取以浸染淋菌，則見淋菌迅即死亡。</p>
<p>有許多學者皆身爲大學敎授，或爲淋病專科醫師，亦均迭次試騐該劑，證明效力宏偉，蓋試騐管中斜面培養基之淋菌，平時極爲活躍而生動，若一經注人此藥液於該試騐管中，淋菌立即死滅。其後德國淋病學大師彼德博士，於百尺竿頭，更進一步，乃取純凈之黃色素及特製蛋白體製成『克淋儂』，從此淋病之治療，遂開一新天地，凡是急慢性淋病如男子龜頭炎，攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，睪丸炎，女子淋毒白帶，子宮炎。陰道淋等，服「克淋儂」均有迅速根本之治愈，久已有口告碑。各國花柳病院中，均採爲淋病內服藥中之生藥，其價值可知，男子外用「抗淋水」，女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥。按圖與說明書在家自療尤佳（「抗淋水」中西太和兩大藥房均售）——美國醫學博士黃仲昌撰</p>
<h3>成癆前之自療</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽爲成癆前之先兆，故欲避免肺病，而先有治療咳嗽之必要，而欲根治咳嗽，並不一定要請敎醫生，能用特效藥在家自療，其收效並不比在醫生處治療爲低。而且在家治療，亦較在住醫院內來得便當，就余二十多年之經騐，接觸的病人，不可謂不多，而能在短期內鎮咳止嗽者，惟肺病聖藥「補肺拿雨」一藥而已。因此藥之鎭咳止嗽功效。完全從咳嗽之原因立塲上製成，絕非一般霸烈之麻醉劑可比。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　節慾後的遺精</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者王益欽，江灣人，年二十五歲，（自訴）——幼時體格甚健，喜閱淫書淫畫，更喜談男女間瑣事，十八歲時，因受同事之引誘，曾數度宿娼，荒淫過度，至廿三歲時，忽染梅毒，求醫診療，前後曾打六〇六八針之多，梅毒始告斷根，自是以後，對宿娼一途，乃不敢嘗試矣，縱使情慾衝動之時，亦必極力彈壓，不料一年之後，竟有遺精發生，初祗一月二三次，其後漸次加密，一星期亦竟有二三次發生，且身體漸衰，精神甚覺疲憊，腦弱健忘，入夜尤患失眠，曾服補劑六瓶，補針十針，亦無寸效，茲因婚期在即，為特來函，務望各大醫師救治爲懇。（治愈經過）——囑其攝生，服「耐而斯遺精片」及德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」。王君遵言而行，一月以後，精神大振，遺精已無，再服一月，體重增加，健康日益增進。</p>

<h3>頑固老白濁之處治法</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>白濁由急性而轉入慢性，復由慢性而成頭固的白濁，一成頑固的白濁，則淋病患者，必更覺度此悠悠的歲月，爲十分困難之事也。故淋病患者，一聞到頑固老白濁之難治，猶如猝觸電流，而宣告死刑。惟以今日醫學進步之速，幾有一日千里之勢。向視頑固老白濁爲難治者，今亦有法可以根治矣！例如淋病中所難根治之關節炎，據余二十年來之研究，並不如一般人所想像中那樣難治。向余亦利用最新科學方法，先作精細診斷診，知此等淋毒性關節炎之程度，而復施以適當的療法，蓋淋毒性關節炎，所波及的範圍甚廣，而其初起與業已化膿之關節炎，及其化膿後之關節炎不同。而其最妥之兼籌並顧之療法，惟有用德國抗淋血淸作靜脈之注射。一方更用淋病聖藥「克淋儂」爲內服劑，使其體身發生一種普遍的殺菌作用，在電療方面，則德國慼應靜電療法，與Wettere　X線療法，恒能於短期內根治之。今試申言其故如下：一因淋毒性關節炎，其淋菌遊行不定、往往此伏彼起！流竄無定。不過在各大關節處之腫痛更大。二用「克淋儂」具有抗淋噬菌的威力，此種抗淋毒素，分散於全部血液，往來遊弋淋菌而段滅之。用靜電與X線電療，及抗淋血淸，旣具殺菌的作用，又有分解癒着的關節炎。故雖淋毒關節炎將成殘廢，亦能迅速治愈　每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈性病空書一冊　兼治梅毒下疳橫痃</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢尚平、首由錢兌業進金號五十兩、爲四千一百十五元、較週六午收做小七元、但比上日塲外則尚抬起數元、少頃滙市頗緊、買風立盛、令號某銀樓各代客方收買、且一時售者不多、遂飛躍四十元、錢兌業進現金號十兩、爲四千一百五十五元、旋以外匯轉鬆、市勢頓形向下、某錢兌業力代多方出籠、即見回挫三十五元、錢兌業出金號二十兩、爲四千一百二十元、時證券帮某號突來撈入若干、同時某錢兌業亦有拖進、故一度又抬至四千一百三十五元、此後終因外匯步硬、致拋賣者絡繹不絕、銀樓帮金號及證券帮均爭先競塞、一時缺乏維持、遂暴跌四十五元、錢兌業售予證券帮三十兩、爲四千〇九十元、其時金號獲利趁賤補進、立升二十元、證券帮進錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百十元、後某證券帮復來猛塞、遂再撳小至四千〇九十元、嗣因匯市止鬆稍平、買風漸盛、某證券帮與某銀號等紛來在拖、不久即回起二十七元、證券帮進金號十兩、爲四千一百十七元、後銀樓幫證券幫某號等再來傾吐、加以進者不力、遂步落十四元、證券幫出錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百〇三元作午收價、午後因滙市續硬、形勢愈疲、價在金號賣風下、開市即小十三元、金號售予證券幫二十兩、爲四千〇九十元、後又跌二元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲四千〇八十八元、嗣以某錢兌業代港方搜買、一時拉起十七元、錢兌業進證券幫二十兩、爲四千一百〇五元、此後港幫吃胃知足、且匯市繼續步鬆、金號錢兌業復來吐售、重又不支下降、錢兌業互做二十兩爲四千〇七十八元、旋以證券幫獲利補空、且匯市止鬆稍平、致遂回起小七元、銀樓幫出金號二十兩、爲四千〇九十五元、入後終因某金號見高又塞、再又降落十三元、金號售予證券幫十兩、爲四千〇八十二元作晚收價、結果比上週末跌四十元、全天七十七元上落、現金號本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金先大後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十五元、迨至九時三十五分掛高五元、未逾半小時即回落五元、此後未見變動、結果大同行仍懸四百十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>供多求少　外幣轉鬆</h3>
<p>昨日外幣初平後鬆、英美金鎊供給見增、市况趨鬆、美金票上午爲十三元零三分、終因供塞旺盛、市價頻跌、晚市降爲十二元五角三分、香港票供給亦暢、市况虛弱、新加坡票·荷蘭票需要稀少、市價下降、坎票亦因美金票頻跌軋降、日金票需要稍盛、市况微堅、晚市爲一元二角七分、朝鮮票反軟弱、晚市爲一元零七分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降一元、英金票降二角、美金票降三角、香港票降二分、新加坡票荷蘭票俱降一角、坎票降二角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現軋升</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率略見回上、每千元初即升至三十五元、繼更步高至三十七元、（但不久即見回退至三十四元半、下午堅站三十五元、比上週六軋升一元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍掛一角五分云、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股創造　新紀錄日　堅昂竟成白熱化</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况略有盤旋、因頗有浮多了結、市價遭受壓迫、漲風稍受挫折、聞南京謠言、係爲壓迫求和、一種做法、而求和停戰、是其眞實作用、昨日上午、初則買氣甚濃、市價堅挺、後以信孚及十四號多頭出籠略爲回疲、午後情形、與上午大致相同、信孚仍有出脫、大豐同康亦有賣出、惟樂茂聯益聯和等仍在不斷吸收、市况又略堅、前途或許經過短時期盤旋後再行上翔、市價結果、除丁種小二角外、餘均好一二角左右、成交約一百餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交寗紹輪船公司股二十股、價爲八元二角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、開盤時堅昂緊張、達於沸點、移時愈演愈烈、羣衆情緒、轉入白熱化、板上所有之股、無不爭先奪取、故名之曰自有交易以來之「新紀錄日」亦不爲過、將近嚮午反動驟起、幸運多頭之了結所有、以獲其旣獲之利、爲極自然之行動、下午回風延長、其時受影響最鉅者、亦即漲時騰達最多者、各高價股比例的較爲堅穩、各股成交、俱甚普遍、故列舉最被惠及之股、加以比擬爲不易、且亦不需之事、</p>
<h3>糧食　常幫高粳　始售限價　碎米平價出售</h3>
<p>昨日內地來源、由虹口轉出者、突見寥落、不過三五百包、而洋米所到亦不夥、早間開手、人心尚浮、多存觀望、鮮有問津，客販亦以身本關係、不再輕拋、價格在售方堅持之下、未見上落、近午聞得外滙續短、洋米身本更重、擁有洋米者心思愈堅、不願脫售、作客又相繼出手、至此市面回昂、不過因棧存殊豐、各貨行情尚難提足、若粳尖國米僅好二三角、常高粳始開限盤爲四十元、各色洋米依外滙轉移、比前市提高三五角不等、獨糯米棧貨旣夥、銷塲轉滯、繼續猛甩一元有奇、</p>
<p>洋米又有到滬、前日（七日）太古公司新北京輪由香港運來四百五十包、又怡和洋行明生輪自香港裝四千三百二十二包、昨巳分別起卸完竣、（祖）</p>
<p>又洋米定貨仍難劃合、現貨整批尚須稍待、而內地鄕客等頗有問津、因此西貢一號米等均已提起二三角、一號米開三十六元二角、回籠原包仍開四十三元七角半、但碎米定貨較多、存底亦充、且平糶已經決定廢曆臘月初十開始、法租界方面米店有數家出售平價碎米（一百五十六斤）爲二十八元、聞市上高碎米亦只售三十二元、次貨之價與平價相同、比之前日小去五六角、</p>
<h3>粉麥仍堅</h3>
<p>現粉趨堅、二號粉廠盤、雖站九元原價、而與客盤相差不少、故廠方祇肯供給零星、數額較大、即行限制、統市成交不滿萬包、客銷綠砲車及天竹各牌、仍開九元四角半至五角、回籠貨供求兩少、價亦相仿、日廠粉市形稍見起色、一月份鳳風牌上週末到過九元〇五六分、今又回至九元二角左右、今日有麵粉二千包運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥來源、稍有零星、貨方以產價不鬆、販運殊多困難、大都不願輕脫、又據洋行消息、澳洲政府將欲限制麥產、而滙水上落甚巨、恐今後定麥亦不易着手、故人心尚堅、售價難小、常錫麥仍站十五元五角原盤、由阜豐廠辦去二千包、福新廠辦去三百包、聞市塲棧單貨亦有一筒之成交、計開常州麥價爲十四元七角云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆續漲角餘</h3>
<p>黃豆市况、因搬運困難、成本昂貴、致高貨來源稀少、大都是中下貨、故脚地堅硬、行市漲多跌少、昨市續砌角外、計開丁家州豆一千六百餘包、價爲十八元至十八元五角、南京豆二車、價爲十七元至十七元一角半、蕪湖豆三百包、價爲十八元一角、太倉豆一百餘包、價爲十八元二角、及崇明沙黃三十七包、價爲十八元四角、平湖杜豆五十包、價爲二十元零九角、</p>
<p>進口生油、昨自靑島來一千六百九十聽、今日（九日）運往香港有豆子一千六百包、花生四百包、生仁五千零九十包、生油四千五百聽、又七十件、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市不振　棉銷沉寂</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉趨沉寂、廠方需落不堪、實以紗銷缺乏、市價不振、因之辦胃不健、惟靑島方面、日廠稍有購買裝運、市情尚穩、目前棉市因紗價有下降之象、致脣齒相關之原棉、當然受其牽制矣、蘇北來源、兩日到通花四千〇六十八包、常陰沙九百四十二包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>火機花　一六二·〇〇同行進　一五〇包</p>
<p>火機花　一六三·〇〇　又　一六〇包</p>
<p>火機木架　一六四·〇〇　又　一五〇包</p>

<p>又　一七一·五〇　又　三〇〇包</p>
<p>美種　一七六·〇〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初、開盤即形堅定、先因投機者之購買、後因同業之踴躍購買及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、近期漲二十磅昔、遠期漲十餘磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方仍然靜寂異常、彼等深恐滙兌之將有變化也、然各方意見、對於海外棉市、却一致看好、對於美棉心意尤爲堅挺也、故同業間作紐約美棉紐約期貨交易者殊爲旺盛、日方廠爲對於美棉之意見、亦看高也、茲將昨日棉市照美滙八元折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支美米特林　二三八·二〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　二三三·九五</p>
<p>三二支　又　二四五·〇五</p>
<p>又　又　下級　二三九·〇五</p>
<p>四二支　又　二四八·四五</p>
<p>又　又　下級　二四〇·七五</p>
<h3>賣戶叢集　紗市欲漲反跌</h3>
<p>紗市先漲後落、趨勢日見衰弱、因客銷旣停頓、而囤戶手貨日見增厚、至於外滙情况、亦不免一種盤旋之局面、在此短時間亦不致於有新姿態發現也、但一般同行心思雖堅强、時進時出、儘係一二月份及二月份期貨、二十支雙馬買賣熱鬧非凡、現紗交易、幾乎完全停頓矣、查昨日香港帮僅辦十包棉紗、同行皮球成交有一千二百包外云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、承上日午後堅挺之氣續進、二十支雙馬開價爲七百四十元、然此價一開賣者叢集、一般搶帽子之流、鑒於塲中籌碼充斥、大衆搶空頭帽子矣、市價又復轉趨下挫、旅聞外滙縮而復長、人心尤虛、實銷更滯、直跌至七百二十七元收盤、查半日間成交統計一千三百八十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌一元、天女跌二元、雙地球跌二元、今日有紗十件運港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、二一〇　內地　七〇</p>
<p>天津　七五　香港　一〇</p>
<p>統計一、三八五</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布實銷仍佳</h3>
<p>棉布以匯市動盪不定、心思生意不旺、然實銷狀况殊佳、故市勢先疲後堅、白貨粗布重磅每疋漲一二角、輕磅平平、細布手貨散額廉售每疋一角至二角半、細斜漲跌參差、漂染印花布疋以整理費續增、開價均堅、北路津烟帮辦藍布府綢二百餘件、南洋帮辦漂布·色布·花布萬餘疋、本街成交細斜·粗布·漂布·府綱·印花布五百餘件、川滇帮辦色布·綫呢·色斜五千餘疋、浙贛帮辦漂布·細布·斜紋七八十件、九日有疋頭四十七件運香港、</p>
<p>東布晨漲午疲、收市時細布復挺、與上週售盤彷彿、細斜微降每疋五分一角間、十二磅龍頭細布現貨上午高峯達二十二元二角半、後市一度跌至二十一元八角、收盤回升至二十二元〇五分、本街成交細布七百餘件、四君子嗶嘰晨開每碼六角七分半、嗣亦降至六角七分左右、蓋以客銷不旺、交易寥寥、</p>
<h3>平厚呢下檔見俏</h3>
<p>平厚呢走銷仍健、下檔七八元起至十元不到檔子、更爲見俏、元色趨勢特佳、因制服號衣、紛至沓來、大衣呢價昂、因之非此莫屬矣、厚平呢需要雖活、遠不似下檔之俏、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市前途　關係微妙</h3>
<p>開關後之絲市、日美曾一度顯呈下縮、同時根據上月紐約蠶絲統計、覺得十二月份紐約絲市不論在進口銷用存底三方、較前月及前年同月均告萎縮、故一部人咸認爲邇來絲價高昂之基礎、甚覺脆弱、因而預測絲價將陸續下回矣、然昨日橫　絲市又告激漲、現貨二三二〇元、漲四十元、近期二三二〇元漲九十元、遠期二三六〇元漲六十一元、蓋目下絲價漲落不能視爲單獨之原因或現象、因戰爭促使生產力下縮、一面促使物價高騰、生絲未能例外、並將循此趨向愈演愈深也、且絲便與日美商約尤有微妙關係、其中變化固甚複雜、本埠絲市在堅呆穩定中、歐銷白廠價六三〇〇元、僅成交五担、白頭洋行印銷千金絲昨做開八〇担、價漲二十元、售盤爲一八二〇元云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白略見鬆動</h3>
<p>昨洋糖以外匯見長、略見鬆落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧五十八元半、外棧新到五十八元、老貨五十七元八角至七角、小五角、轉口貨四十七元、小一元、太古車白東棧B嘜五十九元、西棧五十九元五角、升二角、餘照退、H嘜略緊、西棧四十三元八角、東棧四十三元半、荷赤小五角、MP嘜四十五元半、WA嘜四十五元、本綿白振記一號五十七元半、二號五十七元、小半元、本冰降度相同、一號六十八元、二號六十七元半、晶明冰六十九元半、國糖刁靑據客電囑暫守勿兌、故市勢復緊、昨開出太古輪貨數十包、復升至四十五元、普通惠州白五十三元八角、八日自嗬囒來糖五千包、香港來糖五百七十包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　泉圓來源復遭阻</h3>
<p>雜路桂圓、因泉州方面去船復遭某方阻擱、致乏來貨現在僅漳州一路、略有運到、然以產價不甚合劃、來貨奇缺、查上週五新疆輪到爲數不及十箱、號盤尚看續緊、</p>
<h3>煤炭　越南煤又漲七元</h3>
<p>烟煤塊各貨、自開歲以來、因受開平影響、高檔貨均在百元以上、頓使行莊店難以下手、次檔貨乘機抬頭、走銷甚旺、日昨越南煤同行行拆、每噸又漲七元、計開棧房自車、越南統每噸七十五元、送到另加行扛、</p>
<h3>五金　大馬口鐵　市象蕭條</h3>
<p>大馬口鐵市面、日前因交易繁盛、開價步高、及至最近、紗廠家滾筒作等均無十分進胃、以致市象頓形蕭條、刻市如二十四號貨每箱售八百元、二十六號貨每箱沽三百二十元、均較前步落百餘元之巨、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>怎樣談？</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>自由談要談甚麼，上次已經約略說了幾句。現在應該說說怎樣談了。</p>
<p>三年多以前，林語堂先生在中國的出版界中提出了一西洋雜誌文」的名詞，這名詞在當時的中國可說是相當生疏的，幾乎有點神秘的意味，後來雜誌上時常發表了一些西洋雜誌文的譯文，大家對於所謂西洋雜誌文者才逐漸有些了解，而對於西洋雜誌文也表示熱烈的歡迎。</p>
<p>西洋雜誌文所代表的是一種自由的文體，以沒有固定的格調爲格調。正因爲沒有固定的寫法，所以流露出一種活潑自然的筆緻。</p>
<p>西洋雜誌文好在內容充實，言必有物，不敷衍，不塞責，而格調之活潑，有如良朋好友促膝談心一樣，趣味盎然。</p>
<p>這與中國一部份雜誌報紙的板起臉來說敎的態度，適成一個有趣的對比。八股化的文章讀之枯燥乏味，令人生厭，寫了等於沒有爲。</p>
<p>外國作者寫一篇文章，往往花費了多量的時間，去作實地調查工作，去翻閱參考書，去訪問有關的人士，然後把所得的材料整理出來，所以寫得出內容豐富的特寫文章。並不是說西洋雜誌文每一篇都好到怎樣，不過我們以爲道一點却是我們所應該虛心地學習的。</p>
<p>在這一方面，我們希望自由談能够做個開路先鋒，走這條路。我們希望每篇文章，不論長短，都會言之有物。我們希望每個作者，在寫文章的時候，都實行「自由談」這三個字。</p>
<p>怎樣談嗎？自由談，可是請別瞎談！</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>科學家總動員</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>一個有組織的國家，在戰爭時期，每一個國民都有獻身報國的機會，尤其是科學家，在國家全部戰爭力量中可說是極重要的一股。當這次歐戰爆發後，英國許多科學家們紛紛投袂而起，自動要求政府指派戰時服務工作，據說最近登記的人數已達萬人以上，都靜候政府按各人專長學科分配研究的題目。</p>
<p>戰爭有時可以成爲科學的最好刺激品，有許多科學的發明在和平時是很不容易成功的。這次戰爭中需要得最迫切的發明是一種發燐光的物質，以便燈火管制時應用於地下室。還有一種是防止室中燈光外漏的『濾光器』，都是防空所必需的設備。此外因汽油來源的窘迫，飛機和汽車引擎效能的增高以及燃料的改良也是極重要的問題。發明一種極輕的金屬，可以使飛機的威力大大的擴展；發明一種極猛烈的炸藥，當然對戰爭更爲實用。還有許多重要的研究，都已由專門的科學家分頭積極進行中。</p>
<p>萬一動員的人數太多，研究工作不敷分配的話，政府也決計不再蹈一九一四年的覆轍，讓成羣天才卓越的靑年科學家激於義憤應微入伍，而慘被無情的砲火彈雨所摧殘。第一次大戰中，最著名的犧牲者是年纔二十八歲，在X光研究上正有燦爛遠大的前程的物理學家模斯萊（Moseley）。直到如今，科學界想起此事，還爲之痛惜不止。</p>
<p>英國『科學家軍隊』中還有一股宏偉的潛勢力，就是許多從德奧捷克被放逐出來的猶太難民，他們都是學識經騐異常豐富的專門人才，對於爲正義而戰的國家一定會有極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>在德國，情形剛巧相反。第一次大戰時，有一個『非亞利安』種的科學家哈柏（Fritz　Haber），發明了偉大的氮合成法，解決了德國的炸藥恐慌，使得她能在戰塲上樅續支撑了不少時日。但這位大功臣後來竟也不免受到納粹執政者殘酷的待遇，以致晚年飽受飄泊異鄕之苦，一九三四年死於瑞士。如今德國戰時資源竭蹶的程度，比之上次大戰時並沒有若何减輕，但是許許多多哈柏却早已被希特勒所自願送走了。</p>
<p>科學家集中登記處的工業化學部門主席費利溥敎授（Prof．J．C．Philip）對戰事曾有樂覜的表示，他認爲就科學軍隊的實力而論，英國也佔極大的優勢。有人問他，在這次大戰中，科學家將有什麼驚人的演出，他微笑答道：「上次大戰是化學家發明了毒氣，轟動一時，現在恐怕要讓物理學家來顯顯本領了！」</p>

<h3>成功的梯階</h3>
<p>— 佳歷</p>
<p>這裏有幾個問題，足以把我們造成較有用的人。古人說：「一年之計在於春」。現在正當其時，我們何妨按照次序每天自省一下，我想不久必有意想不到的效果。試試看好嗎？</p>
<p>第一步：要有固定的目標</p>
<p>（一）你的人生目的在那裏？</p>
<p>（二）進行的初步是甚麼？</p>
<p>（三）你爲甚麼不現在就進行呢？</p>
<p>第二步：要善於利用時間</p>
<p>（一）今天你有甚麼應該做的事而沒有做呢？</p>
<p>（二）你爲甚麼擱起不做呢？</p>
<p>（三）你甚麼時候才要做呢？</p>
<p>（四）你明天要做嗎？</p>
<p>第三步：要力求上進</p>
<p>（一）要在你的事業上更進一步，你需要些甚麼學問呢？</p>
<p>（二）你要在甚麼時候開始學習呢？</p>
<p>（三）你在辦公時間以外，用了多少時候去學習你所理的業務或你希望要進行的事呢？</p>
<p>（四）你現在所讀的，是那一種歷史，傳記或商業書呢？</p>
<p>（五）在過去一年中，你所讀的這一類書有幾本呢？</p>
<p>（六）甚麼車你覺着沒有興趣而把牠們擱置起來呢？</p>
<p>（七）假使你從前失學，你現在用甚麼方法去補救呢？</p>
<p>第四步：要虛心自省</p>
<p>（一）今天你做甚麼錯事？</p>
<p>（二）上月份你做甚麼錯事不止一次呢？</p>
<p>（三）今天你對你的同事發怒過嗎？</p>
<p>（四）你有甚麼應改的態度而不自知，你肯虛心地請你的好友告訴你嗎？</p>
<p>（五）今天你有沒有做甚麼粗暴的舉動？</p>
<p>（六）今天你曾妨害別人嗎？</p>

<h3>禮物</h3>
<p>— 雷星</p>
<p>沒有守歲的紅燭來渲染出一份熱鬧，平靜的夜晚成爲年與年的間隔。</p>
<p>淸晨，淡淡的陽光射在桌子上。空空的日曆架子上又是厚厚的一堆了。牠悄悄地告訴我一個消息：「一九四〇年來了。』『又是一年。』以叩問的眼光投回去，我茫然自語。</p>
<p>朋友送來一件禮物：半寸長點的一個琉璃質的駱駝。牠如一枝獎在我記憶的湖上一划，蕩起一圈童年的漣漪。我會心地笑了。</p>
<p>還有一封短簡：「駱駝是沙漢地帶的產物，負載着重荷跋涉又跋踄，耐着飢渴趕奔迢遙的路程。那堅毅的精神是我們所該記取的。如今又是一串新的日子擺在你的跟前了。你是懷着歡欣還是吐出一聲太息來迎接它呢？你知道，活下去是艱難的。而活在道寒冷的人間更得有搏鬥的勇氣與毅力呢。做一個駱駝吧，到沙漠上去我尋你的綠洲。這小玩意兒放在案頭，你是否會憶起那親切的駝鈴聲呢？一聲可噹載近一寸歸程。」</p>
<p>使我發呆的倒是看來無關的那根尾巴。呵，駝鈴聲。我記掛着北方的日子。這城市的生活早令我厭倦了，牠缺乏使生活愉快所決不能少的要素：一種情調或者也可以說一點風味。</p>
<p>但好夢已隨流水去，有家歸不得。古城已窒息了。默默中陽光爬過去了一步。我將怎樣握住這來去如飛的日子呢？</p>
<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>被殺的資格</h3>
<p>— 孔斯文</p>
<p>英國駐華大使寇爾，最近往來於滬渝道上，僕僕風塵，恐怕要算是世界上最忙的人之一了。</p>
<p>有人問寇爾大使說他當初怎樣會到中國來的。他說，常時的英國外相艾登，是他的好友。他本來在伊拉克常公使，公務十分淸閒，便要求艾登派他到一個比較有事情做的地方去。不料艾登聽了他的話，便把他派到中國來。在中國做外交官，可說是沒有一刻空閒的。寇爾大使說到這裏，說：「我眞的得到了！我眞的得到了！」大有「上當！上當！」之意。</p>
<p>寇爾是一位健談而有風趣的人物。此次歐戰發生以後，有幾位英國靑年自願回國充後備兵，準備參加歐戰。有一位朋友笑着問寇雨說：「你去不去呢？」他半正經半開玩笑地回答道：「他們長得正好去被殺，我已經太老，沒有被殺的資格了。」幽默中帶着萬分的沉痛之意。</p>
<h3>談片</h3>
<p>— 史丁</p>
<p>據海通社日內瓦的消息，國聯職員又有一百四十七人失業了。</p>
<p>從一九四〇年一月一日起，匈牙利每星期一與星期五無肉可吃。自作自受，人類眞是笨東西！</p>
<p>倫敦的犯罪案件，因戰爭而銳减，爲二十五年來所未有。戰爭豈亦有其利乎？</p>
<p>美國探險家白特上校於赴南極途中，經過拉巴地方，發覺常地居民不知歐戰業已爆發，引爲異事。與德國俘虜於被捕後始知不是在作軍事演習，相映成趣。</p>
<p>去年各國在南美洲阿根延京城舉行國際棋賽，結果德國冠軍，波蘭亞軍。</p>

<p>前奏</p>
<p>坤伶現在和名伶一樣的「吃香」，此風始自江南，但近頃北國亦復如是，大有一半是坤伶天下之槪。</p>
<p>先談過去</p>
<p>陳德霖楊小樓生前，雖已花甲之年，仍然倚老賣老，能够靠一個老字賣錢，正因爲他們是乾角的關係。坤角呢，五年一小變，十年一大變，聲譽地位，隨著年齡走，變化無窮。論到北方的坤伶，金少梅·琴雪芳·碧雲霞是一個時代；少梅雪芳之後，挨到章遏雲，新艷秋·華慧麟·杜麗雲了。此四人中，遏雲艷秋之藝，較慧麟麗雲要好出一倍以上，現在麗雲早已名花有主，慧麟久居江南，不常登臺，在北方坤伶隊中，論起資格來，可謂各有千秋，遏雲以刀馬旦花旦戲勝，艷秋則長於演靑衣戲，但運氣是遏雲好，所以好幾年來，章遏雲好像比新艷秋紅一點似的。近年來，新艷秋也不常出演，遏雲則數度南來，無形中遏雲的風頭，就比她健得多了。在她們幾個人之後，陸素娟是繼起之唯一紅人，素娟有「第一美人」之譽，以貌美而走紅，藝術當不能與章王作同日語。民國二十二年到二十六年，是陸素娟的黃金時代，現在她已經被一位銀行家築金屋藏嬌了。素娟外，尙有梁秀娟，也曾紅過一時，今秀娟亦爲人婦，這些都成了過去時代的人物。</p>
<p>再談現在</p>
<p>現在在北方走紅的坤角，可以分做兩派，一派是以眞實藝術賣錢的，一派是以交際手腕號召的；以眞實藝術賣錢的，有王玉蓉趙嘯瀾，玉蓉和嘯瀾都是憑一條好嗓子，拿唱來做幌子。玉蓉是王瑤卿的徒弟，嘯瀾是尙小雲的弟子，嘯瀾學小雲學得過份，雖能唱，腔太俗，嘴裏不甚動聽。玉蓉呢，得瑤卿之親授，瑤卿眞用足腦筋敎她的戲，而她也眞拚命用功學戲，五年來，藝術上已有所成就，何况肚子裏又裝了好幾打成本大套的好戲，旣有好配角，又有好捧客，加以玉蓉之八面玲瓏，擅長交際；於是無形中成了目前北方最紅的坤伶。至於所謂以交際手腕號召的呢，那就是吳素秋·趙金蓉之輩了，吳趙在北方，都是頭牌角兒，吳素秋的確是個聰敏孩子，然而戲路太雜，梅程荀尙之戲皆備，更演四大名旦所不演之「巴駱和」「紡棉花」「人面桃花」等戲，弄得觀衆莫明其妙，但扮相頗佳，且善做戲，此其佳點，趙金蓉之藝，實勝素秋一籌，在戲校時，原爲唯一旦角人才，但離校後，反無在校時佳妙，最大的毛病，是嗓子不能保險，但金蓉的根底不錯，能好好的幹，前途未始沒有希望。可惜她現在也重於交際，而不重於實際。</p>
<p>明日即將到滬之後新艷秋飾「玉京道人」之戲裝</p>
<h3>壺齊曲話</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>元旦聽貫大元唱　駡曹</p>
<p>鼓駡曹一劇，於元旦日聽之，不亦樂乎！是夕吾聽其唱也甚佳，尤爲意外之樂，貫大元爲資格頗老之角，十餘年未來海上獻藝矣，彼今番在更新登塲已半月餘，聞口碑尙好，吾日前觀其戰太平，靠把身段有過人之處，唱則未能滿意，今聆其擊鼓駡曹唱工宗譚派，不離大譜。惟字句之問，稍有出入，而不染時流哀傷之音，可證知其根柢甚厚，秉受剛方，不屑效顰以媚時也。嘗考彌正平死於黃祖之手，年纔二十四，見曹操之日，不過二十三歲，血氣方剛，傲氣凌雲，時下所謂譚派名角唱此，每發音多故意作殘秋衰颯之聲，一點朝氣全無，直是一朽邁之老翁耳，豈拚命駡曹之彌正平哉？唱者蓋未嘗夢見彌術影子，此戲曲之大病也。昔於民初，吾在平觀譚鑫培唱此劇，時譚已七十餘，鼓技雖佳，其唱吾猶覺不能滿意，後見羅小寳演此於共舞臺，魄力尙壯，差足以觀，今見大元此劇，可與小寳比肩並駕，非謂完美，比較他人之軟弱以哭爲駡者爲可取耳。若使有好嗓子，則其成績尙不止此，聽其「丞相」之相字，「怎開消」之開消二字，非常圓滿，「駡賊名兒」之兒字，係使單腔，不甚玲瓏，觀其打鼓，右腕極活，左腕不稱，三通鼓之掏點子，夜深沉接節節高之套子，不成精品，此其大槪也。</p>
<h3>歐洲風雲</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>歐洲戰幕揭開以後，好萊塢各影業公司的製片方針，曾頗費躊躇：他們一方面不願放棄輕鬆的戀愛喜劇，同時也顧慮到市塲上的需要。「游藝界」去年曾登過一篇譯文，以「生意眼」爲前題的好萊塢製片人就非常聰明地雙管齊下。同時攝製這兩類電影。「歐洲風雲」於是完成最早的一張。</p>
<p>在這樣情况下所攝製的「歐洲風雲」，自然沒有正面接觸到大戰內在的原因，或作準確的透視，正如其他的「間諜片」一樣，祇是叙述交戰國的間諜的爭鬥。</p>
<p>但是導演者的處理手腕是很高明的。在第一次新機失事以後，錯綜地展開，蘇格蘭探長韓蒙的從事偵查秘密；駕駛員湯尼的懷疑；及敵方因機上並無新發現，將間諜暗殺；同時又貫穿着一個女記者和湯尼的羅曼史。在這數方面交叉的發展下，導演者能層次地處理着，並無顧此失彼之弊，而又緊握着高潮的潦起。同時，爲了調燥劑枯起見，他在韓蒙這一角色身上，灌注了非常濃厚的趣味。</p>
<p>勞倫佛斯的奧立湯尼，稱職而已。賴爾甫李却遜的韓蒙，一反「四羽毛」作風，演這樣一個風趣的角色，可以說得很出色的。</p>

We, however, must follow the instructions of Premier and President Sun Yat-sen that "one who knows can certainly do, and one who does not do cannot know," and utilize our country's great manpower, material resources, and sincere unity, and work hard to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance and building the country.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Significance of the United States Building a Large Navy</h3>
<p>During the US Congressional session, a noteworthy piece of news is that key members of the Naval Affairs Committee have requested Congress to allocate US$2 billion to strengthen the US Atlantic Fleet. It is said that this opinion represents the view of the majority in Congress, and the reasons for this request are: (1) The world crisis is becoming increasingly serious, and in order to ensure the security of the Latin American republics and avoid possible foreign aggression, the United States needs to strengthen its national defense. (2) If the United States wants to avoid a world war, it must have sufficient strength to ensure the security of the New World. Whether in the Pacific or the Atlantic, it needs a fleet with sufficient defense capabilities. The United States already has a naval strength of 2 million tons in the Pacific, so it needs at least two-thirds of that strength in the Atlantic to be able to undertake defense. (3) In the past, there was an "unwritten" understanding between Britain and the United States, that is, Britain's strong naval strength was the first line of defense in the Atlantic, while the United States' strong navy was the first line of defense in the Pacific. But because Britain is currently preoccupied with affairs in Europe, it is naturally impossible for Britain to fulfill its past mission in the Atlantic, and the future changes in the situation are even more unpredictable. Another factor that makes it necessary for the United States to increase its Atlantic Fleet is the threat of a European naval power joining forces with an Asian naval power against the United States. It is impossible to speculate which country is being referred to as the European naval power, but the so-called Asian naval power is undoubtedly Japan.</p>
<p>Since this massive naval construction program was initiated by the US Congress, whether it can be decided by the committee and then passed in Congress remains to be seen. Judging from the current policy of the US administrative authorities, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt was already prominent during his tenure as Under Secretary of the Navy. He has always advocated a large naval policy and wants to make the US Navy the strongest force in the world whenever he has the opportunity. Since he took office as president, there have already been several naval expansion plans. In 1933, he allocated an emergency fund of US$238,000,000 to build 32 warships, the last batch of which was completed in 1938. In the Vinson-Trammell Act of 1934, the US Congress passed legislation allowing the US to build ships to the maximum limit allowed by the Washington Naval Treaty. Under this act, the US planned to build 94 warships, of which 45 have been completed and are in service, while the other 45 are under construction. The 1938 naval expansion act also provided for the construction of 34 warships, but they will not be completed until at least 1944. Therefore, since Roosevelt took office in 1933, a total of 179 warships are scheduled to be built, of which only 89 have been completed, and 90 are still under construction.</p>
<p>Now, if the United States wants to further expand its Atlantic Fleet, and its standard is to achieve that its navy in the two oceans can operate independently and overwhelm other countries in the world, then it is estimated that this US$2 billion naval expansion military expenditure can build 12 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 17 heavy cruisers, 18 light cruisers, 36 destroyers and submarines each, and 53 auxiliary fleets. Taking the average annual output rate of 15 ships from the US shipbuilding industry, it will take at least ten years to complete the construction of the Atlantic's vast naval fleet. The main enemy of the United States is enough to threaten the safety of the United States; judging from what the key members of the Naval Affairs Committee said, it can be said that it is not a European, but an Asian naval power. This Asian naval power has long been carrying out aggression against China. If this aggression does not stop, and the United States continues to supply this naval power with raw materials and fuel its arrogance, or even worse, as one US newspaper pointed out, "Japan may use China as a large arsenal and manpower reserve in the future, which will be harmful to Western civilization," then by that time, even if the United States has a large navy that looks down on everything, it may not be able to cope with the threat that this aggressive country has added to the United States itself.</p>
<p>It will take ten years to complete this naval expansion case. Although it does not have the feeling of quenching a thirst with distant water for the recent threat, its necessity and value will certainly not be reduced due to ten years. But at the same time, we are grateful to the current United States for its material and moral strength, which, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said, has a decisive impact on the fate of the Far East. And now is also the most appropriate time to unleash such a great weapon. Looking back since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan has purchased from the United States US$326 million worth of major combat materials, such as gasoline, scrap iron, copper, automobiles, and airplanes. Japanese goods imported into the United States, just in the eight months before the European war last year, averaged US$39.4 million a month. After the European war, the increase was even greater, averaging US$79 million per month. Japan's international balance of payments relies on trade with the United States for funding, which is not small. In an instant, the US-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire. If the US congressmen in session carefully consider how to use this new weapon, prohibit the export of all military supplies, and do not grant preferential treatment to trade after the non-renewal of the treaty, then the effect of stopping the aggression and the future security of the United States will not be less than the construction of a huge warship. Saving a large amount of naval expenses is just the rest!</p>
<h3>More Than Half of the Japanese House of Representatives Members; Participate in the Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet; Prime Minister Abe Is Extremely Anxious; Seeks Understanding from the Leaders of the Five Parties; The Cabinet Approves the Basic Policy of the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun reported today that, according to the Anti-Government Movement Committee, 276 of the 448 members of the House of Representatives have signed the anti-government resolution. Therefore, the Prime Minister is now taking a cautious attitude towards the political situation, especially since the Diet will be reconvened on January 21. However, judging from the situation in all aspects, the Prime Minister seems to have the determination to proceed with resolving the China Incident, because he has declared that this is the mission entrusted to his cabinet. The newspaper also said that Prime Minister Abe proposed to invite the leaders of the five political parties to his official residence on January 10 to explain his plan to resolve the China Incident and the basic conditions for establishing a "New Central Government" in order to seek their cooperation. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Cabinet convened an emergency meeting this afternoon to approve the basic policy passed by the Asia Development Board on Saturday and Sunday regarding the establishment of a "New Central Government" with Wang Jingwei as the central figure. Before the Cabinet approved this procedure, Prime Minister Abe first explained it, and then Minister of the Army Shunroku Hata described it in detail. Abe presented the Cabinet's decision to the Emperor this afternoon. At present, the Japanese government has officially decided to make every effort to assist the "New Central Government" of China. Well-informed sources believe that the movement to establish a new regime with Wang Jingwei at its core will have considerable development. Some parties declare that the main liaison departments of the Asia Development Board will meet in Nanjing on January 11, and Wang Jingwei, Wang Kemin, and Liang Hongzhi will also meet in Nanjing or Shanghai in mid-January.

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government is scheduled to hold a temporary cabinet meeting today to formally decide on the basic policy for the new government in China in order to complete domestic procedures. Before the temporary cabinet meeting is held, the government intends to convene a temporary Privy Council to explain the contents of the basic policy, and explain it to the leaders of the five political parties to seek understanding. Prime Minister Abe will actively strive to resolve the anti-government movement of the members of the House of Representatives from various factions in order to sweep away the uneasy atmosphere in the political situation. There is an extreme opinion in the cabinet that when the government convenes a five-party summit to explain the countermeasures for the new government in China, it should take this opportunity to carry out work on political parties. The Prime Minister is afraid that this move will not be without the danger of provoking political parties. On the 7th, he discussed with Internal Affairs Minister Ohara and sent Secretary-General Endo to the private residence of Navy Minister Yoshida to seek his opinion. In short, it is noteworthy whether the five-party summit, which will be held on the afternoon of the 10th with the purpose of explaining the basic policy for the new government in China, can serve as an opportunity to transform the political situation. (Eighth Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Before the opening of the provisional Cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, Prime Minister Abe held separate talks with Army Minister Hata and Navy Minister Yoshida to inquire about the opinions of the two ministers on the political situation and made important speeches. In addition, Communications Minister Nagai and Health Minister Akita also stayed at the Prime Minister's official residence after the Cabinet meeting to report on the situation of the political parties in detail to Prime Minister Abe and exchange various opinions on their countermeasures. (Eighth Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: As members of the House of Representatives launched an anti-government movement, the government held a provisional Cabinet meeting today to decide on the basic policy of Japan toward the new government in China, and the attitude of Army Minister Shunroku Hata was particularly noteworthy in all aspects. Army Minister Hata completed the military parade at 11:50 a.m. on the 8th, and immediately entered the Army Minister's official residence and invited Generals Tosui Terauchi and Sugiyama Gen, the military councilors, for an hour-long discussion. The Army Minister then attended the provisional Cabinet meeting, but remained silent throughout and did not express any opinions. (Eighth Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Department of Commerce Declares; Trade Surplus Decreased</h3>
<p>Washington: According to the US Department of Commerce, the total value of US exports in 1939 was 3,100,000,000 gold yuan, the total value of imports was 2,300,000,000 gold yuan, and the trade surplus was 800,000,000 gold yuan. The total value of the trade surplus in 1938 was 1,100,000,000 gold yuan, so the amount of the trade surplus decreased by 300,000,000 gold yuan last year. (Eighth Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Demands on Japan; No Retreat; US Army and Navy Daily; Comments on US-Japan Commercial Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>Washington: The Army and Navy Daily said in today's editorial that whether the United States can establish temporary measures with Japan after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty depends entirely on what level of concessions Japan can make to the United States.

<h3>Japanese Military Spokesman Claims; North China's Status Unchanged; Wang Not the Only Tool to Achieve Peace; Konoe Declaration Just a Political Trick</h3>
<p>Beijing: According to a Japanese military spokesman here today, Wang Jingwei will not succeed in organizing the "New Central Government of China" this month. "If Wang Jingwei is the only tool for Japan to obtain peace, then peace must be impossible. In short, Jingwei is definitely not the only string on Japan's bow. Besides him, there must be other figures." It also said that Japan does not need US mediation to achieve peace. The status of North China will not be changed at all due to his organization. Even if there is a change, it is only a nominal change.

<p>Beijing: The Japanese spokesman here claimed today that even if the New Central Regime to be established is established, the status of the North China regime will remain the same as it is now. The Japanese troops in North China now feel that they must assist in the formation of the new regime. The possibility of the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in China is at least not possible at present. The Mongolian regime and the North China regime will both formulate a special status under the new regime. Jingwei is now trying to make the Chinese people understand that he can handle the overall situation alone, so I, such as refuting it, and saying that Jingwei cannot survive without the Japanese army, then it is close to interference.

<h3>The Incident of the Change of the British Secretary of War Arouses Deep Doubts in the National Assembly Some Congressmen Request Explanation from Chamberlain Duncan and Lease, Two Cabinet Members, Took Office Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the resignation of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, some political figures here recently stated that if Prime Minister Chamberlain believes that the reasons for the resignation are not suitable for public explanation, a certain Member of Parliament may request the Prime Minister to convene a closed-door meeting of the House of Commons to provide an explanation. Hore-Belisha himself has decided to make a "private" statement in accordance with custom on the day the House of Commons reconvenes and after the questioning of the congressmen. Members of Parliament from all parties also expressed, during the holiday yesterday and today, that they should find out the reasons for this matter. In the past, the reasons for the replacement of some important cabinet members, such as former Foreign Secretary Eden, former Naval Secretary Duff Cooper, and even former Foreign Secretary Hoare, were well known to the public. Only this time, Hore-Belisha's departure is mysterious. It is only known that the Prime Minister once asked Hore-Belisha to change to the post of Minister of Commerce, but Hore-Belisha replied that he would rather retire. Political figures all said that Hore-Belisha had already made many contributions to the reorganization of the army during his tenure as Secretary of War, and was therefore deeply loved by the people. It is difficult to understand why the Prime Minister wanted to transfer him to another position. It is said that the Prime Minister once told Hore-Belisha that there were "certain prejudices" about his continued appointment as Secretary of War. Although I don't think so, I also think it is better to try to adapt to the environment. Up to this day, Hore-Belisha has already resigned, and it is said that the Prime Minister still hopes that after careful consideration, he can still take the post of Minister of Commerce. In addition, it is also said that the Prime Minister plans to consult with the leaders of the opposition parties this week on the change of cabinet members. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London - The newly appointed Minister of Commerce Sir Duncan and Minister of Information Sir Lease took office this morning.

(Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent in the National Assembly stated that political figures in London now believe that Hore-Belisha, who resigned as Secretary of War last Friday, will return to a government position in a short period of time. It is said that Belisha has decided to speak in person when the National Assembly reopens on January 16, following National Assembly conventions, at the end of the questioning period. The various reforms implemented by Belisha during his tenure, and the harmony of political views between Belisha and Prime Minister Chamberlain, can be seen from the already published correspondence between the two, which has led newspapers to conclude that the change of Secretary of War is not a harbinger of a change in policy. The comments of The Times on this matter on Sunday can represent the general interest of the English people. It said, "The authorities do not intend to change the policy, and Belisha's achievements deserve the recognition of the general public, and no one has given more recognition and support than the Prime Minister. His greatest achievement is the entire difficult problem of army expansion, which is now proceeding smoothly and being resolved in accordance with a consensus-approved plan. The adoption of a compulsory military service system, the systematic conscription of soldiers, the arrangement of supplies, and large-scale training, all of these plans, like the reforms we have already mentioned, are definite victories that the successor Secretary of War cannot lose." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - This morning, German newspapers unanimously believed that Belisha was a Jew and was therefore excluded from the British cabinet, but there is no doubt that his latent power will still be active behind the scenes of the political stage. The People's Observer stated, "The operational burden borne by the United Kingdom is becoming heavier and heavier. (Omission) British Jews believe that Belisha should retire." The German "One Week One Newspaper" stated, "Belisha's resignation will not change the British political system, only the strategy will change. After Belisha withdraws from the British cabinet, he can continue to carry out anti-German policies in secret." (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - Mr. Belisha, who resigned as Secretary of War last week, bid farewell to his colleagues in the War Office today.

The leader of the Labor Party is very worried that the resignation of Belisha will interrupt several of the reforms he initiated during his tenure. However, the resolutions on these reforms were approved by the entire government, not just by individuals, so there will be no major changes. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

Heavy artillery battles continue, even more intense than the fighting near Suomussalmi. Reports from various sources indicate that many Finnish and Soviet soldiers are freezing to death. It is estimated that more are dying from the cold than from bullets. It is difficult to transport the wounded to safety, and the dead must be retrieved from the front lines after several days due to the thick snow. Finnish 5-ton and 7-ton tanks have been withdrawn to the rear, while Soviet tanks are better suited to sub-zero temperatures and can serve as the spearhead of the Soviet offensive.

<p>Helsinki: General Headquarters issued a war report: (1) On the Karelian Isthmus, artillery batteries from both sides continue to bombard each other. One infantry supply column from the Red Army was ambushed and routed by our forces. Currently, Red Army soldiers on the front lines are digging trenches and laying barbed wire and obstacles, suggesting they intend to wait until the weather warms before launching a major offensive.

Our coastal artillery at the port of Koivisto and along Lake Ladoga was quite active. (5) Soviet aircraft flew to Lahti, Kouvola, and other cities yesterday, dropping bombs. Material damage was minimal. Our air force flew to the front lines and bombed enemy positions. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

Finnish forces hope to achieve victory in the Salla area, but fierce fighting continues due to the arrival of Soviet reinforcements. It has been confirmed that the Finnish commander who defeated the Soviet 163rd Division is General Tuompo. Tuompo directly receives orders from the Finnish Commander-in-Chief. The Soviet offensive in the Salla area clearly aims to directly threaten Rovaniemi, a key railway hub. (Haitong Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

(2) People who evacuated to the suburbs are suffering from the severe cold and are eager to return home. The Finnish authorities are concerned about the air raid danger and the problems of water, electricity, and fuel supply after the population increase. (Haitong Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Finnish Aircraft Fly to Soviet Union, Dropping Bibles</p>
<p>Stockholm: Finnish sources here claim that, according to Finnish pilots, they have repeatedly flown over Leningrad and dropped many abridged versions of the Bible. The Finns are also distributing the Bible in other ways, as they believe the Bible has a significant moral influence on the Red Army. The Finns are currently more optimistic, for three reasons: (1) It is now proven that Finnish air defenses are increasingly effective and are rapidly strengthening. (2) The entire eastern front, from the Arctic Ocean to Lake Ladoga, is defended by a smaller but highly mobile Finnish force against 360,000 Soviet troops. (3) The short southern line of the Karelian Isthmus is the most critical point, but despite the Soviet concentration of large forces in front of the Mannerheim Line, there is no hope of a successful advance.

The pilot boat later towed four lifeboats from the Marseille City, carrying about 40 crew members, into the harbor. A British aircraft, seeing the Marseille City in distress, immediately summoned a rescue ship to save people. The Marseille City was towed into the harbor last night. Apart from the two destroyed lifeboats, there was no significant damage on the surface, but the interior was heavily damaged. Captain Arlsen was injured in the mine explosion.

<p>London: In the first week of the new year, only one British ship sank, indicating that the British Navy authorities are effectively dealing with German submarines and magnetic mines. The public is greatly relieved. The Daily Citizen recently commented on this matter, stating that the future of naval warfare is very optimistic. Furthermore, the government has decided to control the navigation of all ships in the country to meet the needs of the war and economic life, which further strengthens our optimism. In addition, a certain food rationing system has been implemented starting today, which is another reason to be optimistic, as it ensures that there will be no food shortages for the British people.

<h3>Göring Wants to Make Germany a "Factory, Barracks, and Kitchen"—Slogan of German Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>The Hague: The German wartime economy was recently placed entirely under the control of Hermann Göring, the dictator of the country's Four-Year Economic Plan. According to news from Berlin, Göring has decided to take various strict measures in a short period of time to further exploit resources. The slogan is to make Germany a "factory, barracks, and kitchen" and to use "iron and fire" to break through all obstacles. The important measures under consideration are as follows: (1) Department stores are gradually running out of stock, and since there is no way to replenish them in the future, it has been decided to order them to close. (2) Cash stored in banks by these stores will be confiscated by the state and exchanged for short-term or medium-term treasury bills, which is effectively a forced loan. (3) "Informally" prohibiting people from withdrawing more than 500 marks at a time from banks. (4) Issuing small-denomination treasury bills with a face value of 10 marks and 20 marks to be used as part of workers' wages. (5) Public canteens and the "People's Meal" system will be promoted as much as possible. Factories will provide food and accommodation for all employees. (6) Factories that manufacture various daily necessities will be strictly monitored by the state. Any surplus factories will be ordered to close. (7) Conducting a door-to-door inventory of clothing and shoes throughout the country to collect a large amount of old clothing and footwear for military use. (8) Reorganizing redundant agencies. (9) The party, government, and military must be thoroughly reorganized and redundant personnel eliminated. According to Göring's aides, the above measures will be implemented in a short period of time. This is the last card in Germany's domestic policy. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Arrives in France to Inspect British Troops; French Communiqué States Western Front Quiet</h3>
<p>Paris: British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill recently arrived on the French front from London to inspect the British army and air force units. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent with the British Air Force stationed in France reports that when British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill began inspecting British troops in France yesterday, the air force area was shrouded in thick fog and the weather was extremely bad. Aircraft could not take off, so the planned simulated attack at an airfield had to be canceled. Churchill was unable to inspect all the units that the British Air Force Commander wanted him to see. Churchill was accompanied by his son, Second Lieutenant Randolph Churchill, and Professor Lindemann, a scientist. It is said that he brought many official matters from London. After dining with British Air Force generals last night, he dictated his observations to his secretary. The First Lord of the Admiralty looked radiant, and villagers recognized him in every village and welcomed him. He will inspect the air force detachment of the British Expeditionary Force today. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to a communiqué issued here, the Western Front was quiet all night, with only patrol activity in the Vosges region west of the border. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: The entire French border is experiencing rain and fog, and air activity has almost completely ceased. Only one German aircraft was seen conducting reconnaissance in eastern France. Land patrol activity is normal, with soldiers crawling through the mud and rain, especially in western Vosges. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: An authoritative source here, commenting on the situation on the Western Front, stated that there is heavy frost and fog on the Western Front. Artillery battles occur intermittently, and both sides conduct reconnaissance activities. Enemy artillery batteries shelled areas in Berthelming, Oberbetschdorf, and Lixing-lès-Rouhling. German forces also returned fire. (Haitong Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Returns to China, Arrives in Chongqing, Discusses Impressions of Europe During Wartime; Public Opinion in Various Countries Expresses Sympathy for China, Praising the Resistance as Representing the Highest Human Civilization</h3>
<p>Chongqing Airmail: Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, who was ordered to go to the Soviet Union in January of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) and visited various countries in Europe, returned to China from France after ten months. He recently arrived safely here by plane via Kunming and immediately visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for discussions. Yesterday morning, he attended the joint memorial service of the Central Government and the National Government to report on his impressions of the trip. A reporter recently interviewed President Sun at a certain place, and he shared his observations on various situations in Europe, many of which are favorable to the future of China's resistance. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>Among the European newspapers, the Soviet Union paid the most attention to China's resistance. Major and minor newspapers in the Soviet Union devoted many pages daily to reporting news of China's resistance, and always placed it in a prominent position. For example, when news of the great victory in northern Hunan reached the Soviet Union, all major newspapers published it in the most prominent position the next day. The previous speech by President Chiang Kai-shek at the People's Political Council was also published in full. However, there were fewer reports on China's news on September 16, 17, and 18, because the entire Soviet press was filled with news of the invasion of Poland on those days. Afterwards, it returned to the original state. The Soviet Union is very concerned about China's resistance. It is hoped that China's media will pay special attention to this point. The Soviet Union's sympathy and assistance to China's resistance should be cherished. The Soviet Union's view of the European situation is very clear. The Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy will not change.</p>
<p>The current situation in Britain and France after the start of the European war has many points that we can use as a reference. In cities in Britain and France, pedestrians gradually thin out on the streets after 5:00 PM. Blackouts are strictly enforced. Not only do shops not open or light up, but even street lights are all extinguished. When lighting is necessary indoors, thick curtains must be used for cover. After Britain declared war, a total of 150,000 soldiers were transported to the front in France. The transportation arrangements were very thorough, and no one was injured during the transport. However, in the early days of air defense, the number of people killed by cars on the roads at night reached more than 3,500 in a month nationwide. On the day Britain declared war on Germany, the Parliament was in session when an air raid siren sounded. All the members hastily took refuge in the air raid shelter. Who knew that half an hour later, it turned out to be a false alarm. According to the air defense headquarters, an aircraft of unknown nationality was initially discovered in the sky, but it was later determined to be a domestic aircraft. At the same time, because underground shelters were difficult to build in London, ordinary people had to hide in underground subway tunnels. However, sandbags had been piled up in front of the glass windows and doors of large shops.</p>
<p>The air defense situation in Paris is slightly different from that in London. Sandbags were not seen piled up in front of shops, only a large number were piled up around the Arc de Triomphe, intending to protect the sculptures and art. The streets of Paris are much quieter, and the number of customers in cafes has also decreased significantly compared to peacetime. Since there are no lights or pedestrians on the streets of London and Paris at night, the situation is not as good as that in Nanjing when the war first started.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, many measures in France showed considerable panic. The London Municipal Government ordered the requisition of more than 3,000 rooms in hotels throughout the city and evicted all the guests. After more than a month of war, many of the requisitioned rooms were left empty and unused, causing public outcry. However, the municipal government explained that its initial intention was that as soon as the war started, German aircraft would launch a major bombing raid, and London had to prepare 300,000 beds for rescue. Fortunately, Germany did not follow this plan. Once, German aircraft bombed a seaport near Edinburgh. Local residents saw a large number of British aircraft taking off and thought it was a British aircraft exercise, so the crowd gathered to watch. After a while, machine guns and bombs fell, and they realized that German aircraft were attacking, but the air defense department did not issue a warning, causing citizens to accuse them. The evacuation of people from London this time was very swift. More than one million children were evacuated in a few days. In the rural families near London, each family was seen fostering children separately, registering them with numbers. However, since the children fostered in other people's homes were not managed and could not study, the children fostered in each village formed groups and became an uncontrolled world of little angels. After the parents raised objections, the primary schools followed and dispersed to the countryside, and teachers went to and fro, grabbing three or five children to attend class and teaching them in turn. When the parents went to see the children on Sundays, the children cried and refused to stay in the countryside. The parents had no choice but to lead them back to the city. Therefore, all the people evacuated from London returned to the city after a month.</p>
<p>British public opinion's attitude towards this great war seems to be quite similar to the meaning of China's resistance. Once, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill made a broadcast speech, the wording of which was quite similar to the arguments made by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek since the start of the resistance. Afterwards, Sun Ke talked to Churchill, and Sun Ke said to him bluntly, "The wording of your broadcast a few days ago is exactly the same as what China has said and what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has said in the past two years." Churchill replied, "Originally, the nature of our war this time is the same as yours, both resisting aggression." Lloyd George is now 78 years old. When he talked about the European situation, he was very dissatisfied with the British authorities in recent years, saying that this war was the result of the weakness of the authorities in recent years. He and Churchill both suggested to the government several years ago that Britain should actively help China's resistance. British public opinion and the backbone of society all admired China's resistance. They praised in unison, "China has fought for two and a half years, and Japan cannot swallow China. China has already won." The British feel that China is the only glorious and hopeful place in the world. Britain's continued maintenance of its Far Eastern policy is a creed shared by the government and society. Lloyd George also said, "China's resistance not only represents the forces of justice, but also represents the highest human civilization." Once, Sun Ke had dinner with a young noble. The young man, drunk, said that it was extremely boring to be British and that he would rather come to China to live and work. He had some skills: he had studied forest management and could also do carpentry. A third party valued our resistance to the victorious future so much. We should strengthen our confidence and strive to achieve its goal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The wartime organization of European countries is not as perfect as most people imagine. Europeans are extremely tired of war. There is an old lady in France who is over 80 years old. She has personally witnessed three wars in her life. Her husband participated in the Franco-Prussian War, her son participated in the last Great War, and now her grandson is participating. An American reporter recently wrote a book advocating a world federal system. The main point is that if ten democratic countries in the world are united, they will not be afraid of violent aggression. Intellectual circles in European countries are very interested in this kind of speech. Europeans are afraid of war, saying that the source of war is that moral progress cannot keep up with the progress of material and scientific killing instruments. The European war has just begun, and the general public's thinking is already similar to that at the end of the last European war, especially the neutral small countries are in the most difficult situation. Their lives are really at stake and they are helpless.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Beaten in Jiangyin Southern Suburb;</h3>
<p>Raids and Conflicts Occur in Houteng</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Jiangyin, Japanese troops in this city, taking advantage of the New Year's holiday, engaged in widespread harassment. A few Japanese soldiers, at the Fukangxiang Hotel on Shizi Street in the southern suburb, had a misunderstanding with the hotel staff due to language barriers. Unexpectedly, local guerilla forces learned of the incident and promptly killed the Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, some Japanese soldiers went to nearby villages to seize chickens, causing disturbances. Simultaneously, within the city, a puppet police officer named Zhang Jiming fired his gun for no reason, causing great panic among the Japanese garrison. They closed the city gates for three days, cutting off the supply of firewood, rice, and vegetables. After the puppet county chief He Peixuan appealed to the Japanese side, they agreed to reopen the gates. However, people entering and leaving the city are now subject to stricter controls than before, and residents are not allowed to accommodate outsiders. If discovered, their houses will be confiscated. All hotels in the southern suburb are permanently banned from selling alcohol for drinking. Japanese soldiers have been stationed at the Bazhi Bridge, and residents avoid it by taking detours. In Houteng Town in Dongxiang, Japanese soldiers also went to the countryside, ostensibly for searching, and encountered plainclothes guerilla forces, resulting in minor conflicts. Three innocent people were killed. The Japanese troops did not dare to linger in Houteng and returned to the city on the same day.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Overview of the Promotion of Free Education in China (V)</h3>
<p>(3) Regarding the Improvement of Private Schools and Itinerant Teachers: It has been found that the number of private schools originally existing in various provinces is quite large. Therefore, it is stipulated in the free education plan that they should be utilized as much as possible and improved to supplement the inadequacy of primary schools. However, few provinces and cities have implemented this, so there is no statistical report. As for the pilot implementation of the itinerant teaching groups, some provinces and cities have promoted them, but their number is very small. According to reports from various provinces and cities, there were 200 groups in the 24th year and 735 groups in the 25th year.</p>

<p>C. Regarding the Raising of Funds for Free Education: According to the outline of the regulations, the funding for free education should be raised locally as a principle. However, for remote and impoverished provinces and cities with special circumstances, the central government may provide appropriate subsidies. The central government's subsidies to various provinces and cities for free education over the years totaled 3.2 million yuan in the 24th year, including 2.4 million yuan from the national treasury, 500,000 yuan for border education, and 300,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer Indemnity funds. In the 25th year, it totaled 4.575 million yuan, including 3.9 million yuan from the educational construction funds, 500,000 yuan for border education, and 175,000 yuan from the Sino-American and Sino-French Boxer Indemnity funds. In the 26th year, it totaled 6.665 million yuan, including 5.9 million yuan from the educational construction funds, 500,000 yuan for border education, and 265,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, and Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity funds. However, due to the war of resistance, the educational construction funds in the 26th year were reduced to 70% from September onwards, and 10,000 yuan from the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity was not allocated. Furthermore, the subsidies for the provinces and cities in various war zones were adjusted and suspended by order, so the actual amount could not be fully distributed. In the 27th year, it totaled 1.741 million yuan, including 1.407 million yuan from the educational construction funds, 224,000 yuan for border education, and 110,000 yuan from the Sino-British and Sino-American Boxer Indemnity funds. In the 28th year, considering that the reduced distribution of this subsidy would have a considerable impact on the promotion of free education, it was changed to a full distribution. The subsidy amount included 448,000 yuan for border education and 4.3 million yuan for free education. As for the free education funds raised by various provinces and cities over the years, in the 24th year, the increased free education funds raised by various provinces and cities, according to the reported figures, totaled approximately 10.707 million yuan, exceeding the total amount of central subsidies by three times. In the 25th year, according to the reported estimated figures, it totaled approximately 14.733831 million yuan, also exceeding the total amount of central subsidies by three times. In the 26th, 27th, and 28th years, due to the war of resistance, it was difficult for the provinces and cities in the war zones to raise additional funds. However, the provinces in the rear were still able to make efforts to raise funds.</p>

<h3>Foreign Nationals Hold Serious Views After the Philippe Case; Expect Thorough Investigation; The Three Assailants Remain at Large; Increased Police Presence in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Following the assassination attempt on Mr. Philippe, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, on the morning of the 6th of this month, the authorities of the International Settlement have greatly increased police presence in the area of extra-settlement roads since the 7th. In the Italian military defense zone, near the extra-settlement roads, the number of patrols, which used to be only two or three, has been increased to seven or more since the previous day. To apprehend the assailants, the authorities of the International Settlement increased the number of Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives after the incident. In addition to patrolling and guarding the areas near the extra-settlement roads, they also checked pedestrians one by one within the settlement. The authorities of the International Settlement are continuing to demand the surrender of the assailants. It is reported that the three men who attacked Mr. Philippe have been apprehended in a village near the Haig Road shooting location in the western district. However, the Japanese military police authorities have reportedly strongly denied the protests of British Military Commander Major General Simmons, claiming that no assailants have been captured. According to another report, the shooting incident occurred between Haig Road and Avenue Foch of the French Concession. As many as ten shots were fired in quick succession that morning, eight of which hit Mr. Philippe's car. One bullet even hit the right side of the back of the seat in Mr. Philippe's car. Mr. Philippe's escape was considered fortunate. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the International Settlement is now taking special precautions at Mr. Philippe's private residence and has dispatched Chinese and Western detectives under Mr. Philippe's command for protection.</p>
<p>The Three Assailants Have Not Been Handed Over</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that although the "enemy-occupied territory" authorities acknowledged to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the International Settlement on Saturday that they had captured three assailants who attempted to assassinate Philippe, they have not released any information about the whereabouts of the three assailants and even claim that they have not captured the assailants. The British Military Authorities of the Municipal Police Department and the British Consulate General have requested cooperation in apprehending the assailants, but to no avail. It is understood that the three arrested men are now at the headquarters of the Japanese military police at 94 Jessfield Road. Police officers from the Municipal Police Department went to the "Avenue" Police Station on Saturday to request the chief of police to hand over the three men. The chief of police first claimed that he was unaware of the arrests, then made three phone calls and informed the Municipal Police Department officers that three men holding Mauser pistols had been captured but could not be handed over because they were not arrested by the "Avenue" police. Subsequently, the Municipal Police Department's attempts to detain the three men were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Consider It Serious</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that, according to reliable sources, the Municipal Council will submit a detailed report to the Consular Body and other responsible authorities regarding the assassination attempt on Secretary-General and President Philippe on Saturday morning. Senior foreign nationals in the city consider the case very serious and expect that it will not be allowed to be shelved and will only be resolved after the assailants are apprehended and the case is clarified.</p>
<p>Negotiations Expected Soon</p>
<p>There is much speculation among the general public about the motives behind the case. Although the Municipal Police Department claims that the three assailants were captured by bodyguards from a gambling den on Haig Road and handed over to the police station, which transferred them to the headquarters of the Japanese military police at 94 Jessfield Road, they are still being held there. However, the Japanese side claims to be completely unaware of the matter. It is expected that the authorities will discuss the case soon.</p>
<p>The Assassination Attempt Was Carefully Planned</p>
<p>It has been found that the assailants carefully planned the assassination attempt. About ten accomplices intercepted three rickshaw pullers on Brenan Road early Saturday morning, robbed their clothes and vehicles, and detained the rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers were released after the incident and went to the Jing'an Temple police station to report what had happened.</p>
<p>Strict Security in the "Enemy-Occupied Territory"</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" also reported that security was tight in the "enemy-occupied territory" yesterday. The Italian military defense zone occupies part of the extra-settlement road area, so the number of Italian soldiers on patrol in the area has been doubled. These patrol teams, which previously had only three soldiers per team, have been increased to five to seven soldiers per team. The two sentries stationed daily on Edinburgh Road and Avenue Road have been increased to four. In addition, armored vehicles and Indian mounted police from the Municipal Police Department were on standby in the area throughout the day, and the number of patrol officers at each intersection has also been increased.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Patrolling North of the Yangtze River Reportedly Sailed to Guangdong</h3>
<p>No Japanese Warships Follow Foreign Ships to Various Ports</p>
<p>Navigation along the North Bank line of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been greatly affected in recent months due to Japanese obstruction of foreign ships loading passengers and cargo. According to shipping industry sources, the Japanese have recently tightened their control over cargo transport to ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. German and Italian commercial ships sailing to ports such as Hutong, Qinglong, and Xingang are unable to load cargo, resulting in large quantities of goods piled up in various places. The Japanese are particularly attentive to British Jardine Matheson and Taikoo ships sailing in the area, sending patrol boats to accompany and obstruct them. Other German and Italian ships also feel inconvenienced. According to a British ship crew member who returned to Shanghai the other day, it is said that the Japanese warships patrolling the Yangtze River near the North Bank have gone to Guangdong. Therefore, no Japanese warships follow ships sailing to ports such as Qinglong and Hutong, and loading and unloading cargo has become more convenient, but it is unknown how long this will last.</p>
<h3>The Puppet "Reformed Government" Sends Out Strange Invitations; Inviting People to a Banquet at the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong and Claiming "Recovery of Hong Kong and Signing of Treaty"</h3>
<p>Newspapers such as the "Shanghai Times" and the English-language "North China Daily News" reported that they had received English invitations from a person claiming to be Gan, a specialist for the "Reformed Government of the Republic of China" for the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, Hong Kong, Kowloon, etc. The invitation was to attend a banquet to be held at the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong to "celebrate the signing of a treaty between China and the UK on the return of Hong Kong." However, the date of the banquet was not specified, only stating that "the exact date of the signing of the treaty will be announced later." The invitation was sent from 8 Gulou New Village, Nanjing, on January 1st and asked recipients to reply whether they could attend. It also stated that "when the Sino-British agreement is formally signed, the return of Hong Kong to China will become a reality. The encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty by foreign concessions in various places is now a thing of the past."</p>
<h3>Joint Charity Association to Begin Distributing Steamed Buns Tonight – Distributing near Longmen Road Each Evening – Still Hopeful for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Association Federation, in order to relieve the poor people of this city, in addition to opening cold shelters as usual, has also decided to distribute steamed buns every evening starting today (the 9th). Our reporter from Datong News Agency has investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Distributing Wheat Flour Steamed Buns</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Association Federation, in view of the fact that the number of refugees and beggars dying of hunger and cold this winter is greater than in previous years, has decided to start distributing steamed buns earlier, starting today (the 9th). The location has been selected as the Renji Infant Nursery area on Longmen Road, south of the Race Course. The distribution time is set for 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM every evening. In terms of order, the Chengdu Road police station will send officers to maintain it. The association plans to prepare five to six thousand wheat flour steamed buns each evening, each weighing four taels. Depending on the number of people, each person will be given two to four buns. Regarding the care on the road, the association has appointed Mr. Lu Deshen and Mr. Cheng Tongsheng to be specifically responsible for handling it. This charitable act of distributing steamed buns will be limited to one month, ending at the end of the old lunar year. In order to help these poor people receiving steamed buns to resist the cold, the association will distribute a cup of hot ginger soup to each person. The thoughtfulness of providing benevolent drinks and righteous grains can be described as thorough. In addition to the 5,000 yuan generously donated by Mr. Wang Junsheng of Pushan Villa, the above-mentioned distribution expenses are still hoped to be subsidized by all sectors.</p>
<p>Cold Shelters Being Organized</p>
<p>In addition to distributing steamed buns, the association is also very concerned about the problem of cold protection for the poor people. In addition to the first cold shelter that has been opened at No. 330 North Fujian Road, which has already taken in more than 700 poor people, the second cold shelter will also be opened within days. The location is planned to be at the Xujiahui Catholic Church and negotiations are in progress.</p>
<p>Secret Relief for Hidden Poor</p>
<p>The association is also aware that prices are soaring in Shanghai, and the prices of firewood and rice are particularly expensive. Many middle- and lower-class families find it difficult to make ends meet. However, in order to save face, they do not hesitate to borrow and pawn, cutting flesh to heal sores. The mental distress of these hidden poor people is even greater than that of the extremely poor. According to the reporter from Datong News Agency, the association is currently planning relief measures. The method will also start secretly, either by friends and relatives reporting on their behalf, or by the person directly writing to the association for a statement, and they can use a pseudonym. The association will absolutely keep the above-mentioned relief matters confidential.</p>
<h3>Decision on Stabilizing Rice Prices – Six and a Half Catties of Broken Rice per Yuan, Limited to One Yuan Purchase – One Hundred Designated Rice Shops Responsible for Handling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association held a temporary joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the association’s office on Shanhaiguan Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan first reported on the handling of price stabilization entrusted by the Price Stabilization Committee to the association. The following measures were unanimously approved on the spot: (1) Designate one hundred members in the two concessions to handle price stabilization (fifty of which specialize in selling price stabilization rice coupons and fifty specialize in selling rice); (2) The price is six and a half catties of Saigon broken rice per national currency one yuan, with a limit of one yuan per person; (3) Each shop will be limited to 50 bags of stabilized price rice per day, from 1:00 PM until sold out; (4) Send a letter to the Price Stabilization Committee to forward a letter to the authorities, posting notices at the beginning of the price stabilization, strictly maintaining order, and dispatching police officers to protect each rice shop distributing and selling rice. The price stabilization date will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Price Stabilization Committee (January 18, the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month). The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. In addition, the Civil Food Adjustment Association held its third executive council meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported on the following matters: (1) The resolution of the temporary general meeting of members to raise funds for price stabilization and organize a price stabilization committee; (2) The process of establishing the price stabilization committee; (3) The association has notified all members and associations (both those who have recognized and those who have not) of the resolution to raise funds for price stabilization; (4) Associations that have recognized the association's funds, in addition to allocating price stabilization donations, are still requested to submit payments as usual; (5) The trust department of Yu Cheng Bank received 170,000 yuan in foreign rice orders, totaling 8,500 bags.

<h3>Local Russians Celebrate Christmas</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Russian Christmas Day, which is traditionally celebrated on January 7, is thirteen days later than the Christmas Day celebrated by Christians in other countries. The approximately 20,000 White Russian expatriates in this city are mostly devout believers and went to church to participate in the service on Christmas Eve last Saturday night. In terms of family, according to the old Russian custom, one must absolutely fast before the first star appears in the sky that night. However, for those who live in large cities abroad, such as Shanghai, it is very inconvenient to strictly abstain from food, so they reduce their food intake. However, Russian Christmas is the same as Easter. The housewife must always prepare special seasonal dishes to decorate the auspicious day. As for the celebrations outside the family, Russian community groups have been severely hit by the economy, and the grand occasion is far less than in previous years. Only White Russian schools and charitable organizations hold Christmas tree banquets to entertain children. Russian newspapers have published Christmas special issues to show their celebrations.</p>
<h3>Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong – Property Rights Falling into Foreign Hands – Japanese "Hengchan Company" Designates "Construction Zone" – Enclosing Vast Areas, Property Owners Unable to Intervene</h3>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the Japanese-invested "Shanghai Hengchan Company" has been actively seizing private land to build houses for profit. Recently, it has hired dozens of Japanese supervisors to oversee a large number of ignorant Chinese laborers to dismantle graves, causing corpses and bones to be scattered everywhere, a tragic sight to behold. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Construction Zone" Forcibly Seizes Private Land</p>
<p>The so-called "Shanghai Hengchan Company" is a Japanese semi-official profit-making organization. Last year, it obtained the consent of the Japanese special service agency and designated a vast area of land in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong as a "construction zone." The property in the designated area, regardless of who owns it, will be seized. Because most people fled abroad after the war, the company was able to do whatever it wanted and could not be dealt with. Even a few poor people who had no choice but to return to their hometown saw that their houses and properties had been enclosed and could not live there. If they tried to entrust powerful people to mediate, the "company" would arbitrarily estimate the lowest land price and give them a paper voucher that could not be cashed, without getting a penny. If no one helps, their property will be lost.</p>
<p>Puppet Land Bureau Unable to Intervene</p>
<p>The puppet "Land Bureau" believes that the above-mentioned situation of arbitrarily and forcibly confiscating people's land is also inappropriate, and the "Hengchan Company" did not notify the puppet "bureau" or puppet "government" when enclosing private land, regardless of them. The puppet "Land Bureau" believed that it was infringing on its rights, so it repeatedly sent people to the "Hengchan Company" to negotiate politely last year, requesting that the puppet bureau agree to the procedures before the company encloses private land. However, the Hengchan Company ignored this request, so the puppet bureau could not intervene in the company's actions.</p>
<p>Laborers Greedy for Profit, Digging Graves and Dismantling Coffins</p>
<p>After a year of operation, Hengchan Company has selected originally bustling urban areas in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong to build houses first in order to rent them out for profit. In addition, it has also been tidying up the more remote enclosed land recently, and has sent dozens of Japanese "supervisors" to oversee hundreds of ignorant Chinese laborers to dig up graves, move floating coffins, and move coffins from all over every day. These workers are even more ruthless and believe that there are often metal objects left in the coffins by the dead relatives, so they collude with the "supervisors" to arbitrarily open the coffins to search for better coffins, causing the coffins to be messy, or even scattered all over the ground. The harm is particularly severe in the countryside around Jiangwan Town.</p>
<p>Yunzaobang Properties Enclosed</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Japanese have designated Yunzaobang in Wusong as a "commercial port" and plan to build a "new city." The preliminary plan has been implemented. Starting from Yizhou Pond Yunzaobang Estuary, all the way west to Jiaqiao, the most private land has been enclosed, with the most being in Tuier Shiyi, Tuier Shier, and Gang Sanshier. This procedure is entrusted by the Japanese "Hengchan Company" to the puppet municipal government land bureau for valuation and handling "registration" within a limited time. Those who do not go within the time limit will have their land confiscated. It is now known that the private land purchased is sold for more than one thousand yuan, all issued with Hua Xing public bonds that have no guarantee, and no cash is available. There are even local ruffians who act as accomplices, using intimidation to force the villagers to sell the land they cultivate for a living at the lowest price and must move to live elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Japanese Censor Suppresses Reuters Telegrams – News of the Burning of a British Hospital by the Japanese Army – Detained Twice, Arriving After a Long Delay</h3>
<p>Reuters Shanghai, January 8 – It was learned here today that a Reuters telegram from Qingdao about the burning of the British Managed Hospital near Wudingfu in Shandong Province on Christmas Day by Japanese soldiers had been suppressed, presumably by Japanese censors. The first telegram, sent from Qingdao at 6:15 PM on January 4, did not reach Shanghai until after 7:00 PM on January 6, taking as long as 48 hours. The second telegram, reporting that the Japanese authorities admitted that the hospital had been burned, was sent from Qingdao at 6:00 PM on January 5 and did not arrive until 2:15 PM on January 6, also detained for a long time. According to the only telegraphic communication from Qingdao to Shanghai, the wireless company managed by the Japanese, the usual time required for a normal Qingdao-Shanghai communication is about three hours. The Shanghai branch of the wireless company said that everything was as usual in the past few days.</p>
<h3>Farmers Bank Handles – Agricultural Product Storage Pledge</h3>
<p>Grains, Wheat, Cotton, Miscellaneous Grains, and Native Cloth – Priority Right to Purchase with License</p>
<p>In order to store food and avoid low grain prices harming farmers, the National Government ordered the Farmers Bank of China to make loans as much as possible. After receiving the order, the bank has formulated measures for agricultural product storage pledge loans and has begun to purchase and store pledge products. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Target</p>
<p>The target of storage pledge loans is as follows: (1) Cooperatives, cooperative federations, cooperative treasuries, and mutual aid societies; (2) Agricultural warehouses or simple agricultural warehouses established in accordance with the Agricultural Warehouse Law and the Temporary Measures for Simple Agricultural Warehouses in Emergency Times. Pledge products are limited to grains, wheat, cotton, miscellaneous grains, and native cloth. The pledge amount is based on 75% to 80% of the current price. The repayment period and interest rate are determined according to the actual situation in each province. Within the scope of possibility, all pledge products should be insured against various disasters. Except for those needed by farmers themselves, the bank has the priority right to purchase all pledge products at market prices.</p>
<p>Loan Method</p>
<p>The loan method is stipulated according to the special circumstances of each province as follows: (1) In Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces, the cooperative treasury system is used, and the provincial cooperative treasury is entrusted to transfer the loan. The responsible line office will negotiate a contract with the provincial cooperative treasury; (2) In Shaanxi, Hunan, and Henan provinces, the cooperative administrative agency will introduce the loan to cooperative societies at all levels. The responsible line office will negotiate a contract with the cooperative administrative agency; (3) For agricultural warehouses or simple agricultural warehouses loans established by provincial and county governments or other legal organizations in various provinces, the responsible line office will negotiate a contract with the construction department to plan and handle it.</p>
<p>Guarantee Responsibility</p>
<p>The loan guarantee measures are stipulated as follows: (1) If the loan is introduced by the cooperative administrative agency and loaned to a cooperative organization, the agency shall be responsible for guaranteeing repayment; (2) If the cooperative treasury is entrusted to transfer the loan, the cooperative treasury shall be responsible for guaranteeing repayment; (3) If the bank directly loans, it shall ask the local government or nearby cooperative organization to guarantee the funds. If the pledge products are in danger of having funds on the day, the agency introducing or the agency entrusted shall submit a request to the provincial government to use administrative power to transport them to a safe area in advance.</p>
<h3>Joint Office of the Four Banks – Aimed at Consolidating Wartime Finance – Centralizing Funds to Establish a National Financial Network</h3>
<p>In order to consolidate central finance during the war, the Ministry of Finance, after being approved by the National Defense Supreme Committee, established a joint office by the four banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture.

<h3>Group Rice Purchase and Price Stabilization – Price Stabilization Measures Can Only Provide Temporary Relief, but Group Rice Ordering Has Self-Defense Significance</h3>
<p>— Kui Yanfang</p>
<p>Since the rice price in this city soared, it has had a great impact on social order and the security of the concessions. Those who are frozen and starved are not afraid of the law and take risks. Robbing rice and looting on the road occur from time to time. Salary earners are also greatly threatened in their lives. Therefore, employees of shops, companies, and factories demand wage increases to solve their lives and go on strike. Labor and management are at odds, disputes arise one after another, people are frightened, and society is uneasy. At present, when there is a bumper harvest everywhere and new grains have just been harvested, such a serious situation has been brewed. If the time comes when the old and new grains are not connected, the four million citizens of this city may be in danger of running out of food, and the danger is even more unbearable to imagine. Yanfang believes that in this period, if we do not recognize the goal, work together, and plan measures, we will not be able to solve this serious problem. Therefore, in December of last year, I asked Yu Qiao Lao and leaders of the industrial and commercial circles to organize the Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association. At the same time, Yanfang published a tentative proposal on adjusting the Shanghai civil food plan in various newspapers, detailing the ordering methods. Fortunately, this proposal was approved by all sectors. Therefore, the association raised a fund of one million yuan and determined that its purpose was to purchase foreign rice to adjust the market. When the association is dissolved, the fund will be returned according to the ratio of losses suffered from purchasing rice to stabilize the market. It is a good method for the United States, France, and Italy, which is the most effective method for adjusting civil food. Within ten days, group rice purchasers from all walks of life flocked to register with the association, and the Shanghai rice market also stabilized slightly.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated price stabilization for relief. If we can take care of both and proceed together, it is also feasible. However, group rice purchase is the key strategy for adjusting civil food at present, and it cannot be abandoned. It should be actively promoted to achieve complete success. Group rice purchase is a fundamental solution, while price stabilization is a temporary solution. The nature is different, and the effectiveness is different.</p>
<p>1. The purpose of group rice purchase is to plan ahead and prevent rice shortages. Shops, factories, schools, etc., should purchase foreign rice in advance according to the amount of rice they need, and store another 100,000 bags of foreign rice in a safe warehouse. In case the rice price soars again, this 100,000 bags of rice will be sold to flatten the market, and speculators will have no use for their skills. In this way, the rice price will naturally fall, and the manipulation of speculators will be useless. In this way, the rice price will naturally fall. However, once the 100,000 bags of stored rice are sold, they must be immediately replenished in sufficient quantities to ensure that the warehouse has storage and is not afraid of anything. In any case, with this 100,000 bags of stored grain, there is no need to worry about rice shortages, and flattening the market price is another matter. This is considering the consumers themselves and contains the meaning of economic self-defense.</p>
<p>2. Price stabilization is also a method for adjusting civil food. At present, there are 4 million residents in Shanghai, of which at least 3 million are working poor. If 1 million yuan is raised for price stabilization, the average person will get only the food rice worth 30 cents in national currency. This small amount is of no help. It is not easy to raise a huge sum of 10 million yuan. Moreover, price stabilization is a charitable matter, not a fundamental solution. As for the procedure for handling price stabilization, if it is not strict, there will be many malpractices. If it is too strict, the benefits will not be widespread. I still remember that in September of last year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held price stabilization events in the public concession and the French concession. There were many rice purchasers, and it was very crowded. Injuries and loss of items were often heard. Women and the elderly stood all day long, and often did not get a single grain of rice. The strong took the lead and often gained more than their share. It is said that this time the price stabilization has set up 50 price stabilization points in the two concessions. Although crowding can be avoided, it is worth noting whether it can be universally beneficial and make the majority of the poor not feel left out.</p>
<p>3. The fund for group ordering of foreign rice was originally set at 1 million yuan. Now, due to the enthusiastic participation of various industries, it has increased to 2 million yuan. It can be seen that this matter is closely related to the livelihood of the general public, so it can be supported by the public. Moreover, the use of this fund is endless, circulating to purchase rice, which can flatten the market price for a long time and prevent manipulators from having the opportunity to hoard. The solution to the Shanghai food problem depends on this. Its benefits are universal and benefit both the rich and the poor. It is not just a passive measure like price stabilization, where the beneficiaries are limited to a local group of people, and it is only temporary.</p>
<p>4. The fund for group ordering of foreign rice will be fully returned to the original payers after the rice price falls and returns to normal, and after the association is dissolved, except for the unavoidable losses. Compared with the fund raised for price stabilization, it is just a charitable donation, which is very different. Moreover, group rice purchase and flattening the market price are aimed at ensuring the livelihood of the majority of citizens. If we do not prepare for it now, when the rice is exhausted in the future, we will not be able to purchase it even if we increase its value. In the future, whether the livelihood of Shanghai citizens and the peace of society can be maintained in the long term is even more difficult to predict. As for price stabilization, although it can provide temporary relief, its relationship with the entire city is not as deep and close as this.</p>
<p>In short, for social public welfare undertakings, we should sacrifice the private interests of the minority and seek the welfare of the majority. Some say that the purpose of holding price stabilization and group rice purchase this time is to adjust civil food, and the goals are the same, so things can be done in parallel without being contradictory. In fact, no matter what, there is a distinction between the order of priority and importance, which cannot be regarded as the same. Although price stabilization can adjust civil food, its effect is minimal, and the benefits it provides are also small. As for group rice purchase, it is a guarantee for the future life of citizens. All industrial, commercial, academic, and economic citizens who are able to support themselves should be responsible for actively ordering. Or perhaps the general public is dazzled by the good name of price stabilization and forgets the benefits of group rice purchase and is lazy in promoting it. In the future, they will suffer the consequences themselves and regret it too late. Therefore, Yanfang does not hesitate to spend words to tell the social figures of this city.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Organizations Appeal for – Free Transportation</h3>
<p>Should Be Differentiated Clearly – Shanghai's Production and Sales Need to Be Developed Urgently</p>
<p>In order to increase wartime production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has repeatedly conducted in-depth research with relevant agencies on the export of non-prohibited local goods and the import of completely domestic goods, and formulated measures. After being approved by the Military Affairs Committee, domestic goods products in various guerrilla areas are prohibited from being imported into the interior. However, for the products of Chinese factories within the Shanghai Concession, those that are verified to be actual domestic goods are allowed to be imported. For goods that have been manufactured, they are not allowed to be imported. The ministry has already telegraphed the municipal governments of various cities to inform them and ordered the Ministry of Finance to notify all customs offices across the country to comply with it. At this critical time, some domestic goods factories in this city, although named domestic goods, mostly use raw materials from foreign countries. However, most factories still try their best to use domestic raw materials. In addition, at a time when all industries and businesses are feeling distressed and various places are suffering from invisible blockades, it is not easy to sell domestic goods internally. If the transportation of domestic goods to the interior is prohibited again, Shanghai's domestic goods industry will suffer a serious blow. Therefore, after repeated consultations between domestic goods organizations in this city, it was decided to submit a report to the authorities detailing their difficult situation, and to call for a clear distinction to be made and for the order to be revoked, allowing domestic goods to be transported freely for domestic sales, in order to maintain the entire domestic goods market. Moreover, at a time when the war of resistance has not yet ended, production should be increased and developed both domestically and internationally.</p>
<h3>Coal Price Soars – Affecting Industry</h3>
<p>National Products Manufacturers Association Expresses Support for Implementing Group Purchase and Transportation</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens Association yesterday, saying that it had read in the newspaper that Committee Member Zhang Yizhai and others jointly suggested group coal purchase, and the various branches of the association responded enthusiastically, requesting to discuss and implement it as soon as possible to relieve the people's difficulties. It is indeed the most urgent task in Shanghai at present. Coal is a necessity for people's livelihood. The prosperity of factories, the smoothness of public utilities, and the level of commodity prices are all closely related to it. All civilized countries in the world regard it as the mother of industry and the source of science. Recently, the price of coal in Shanghai has soared, which is due to the smooth flow of sources and the manipulation of a small number of large coal merchants. As Committee Member Zhang and others said, the original price of Kailuan coal is still only about 40 yuan per ton. Once these people transfer it, it will double or more. And the various industries, in view of the soaring coal price, have raised costs and sold at higher prices. This echoes each other and has a great impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. The association is a group of domestic goods factories and deeply feels that the soaring coal price affects the production of member factories and is also greatly related to social security. Therefore, it expresses its great approval of the suggestions of your committee members and others. It is specially sending a letter to request that you discuss and implement it as soon as possible to stabilize people's livelihood and benefit domestic goods. It is hoped.</p>

<h3>Rectifying Wind School Staff Member, Wang Daonan, Stabbed - Walking Alone, Suddenly Surrounded by Three Men, Suffering Six or Seven Knife Wounds, Life Not Yet in Danger</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 1:00 PM, a man was walking alone at the intersection of Hart Road and Annam Road in the Public Concession when suddenly three men in short clothes blocked his path.

<h3>Sister and Brother, Kidnapping a Girl, Sentenced and Given Probation</h3>
<p>Guihong, the 11-year-old daughter of Mrs. Meng Zhang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 39, Lane 847, Tiantong Road, suddenly disappeared at around 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month. She asked people to search everywhere, but to no avail. She did not return that evening. Mrs. Meng Zhang, knowing that the neighbor’s maidservant, Chen Zhou, from the same hometown, often went out to play with her daughter, questioned her, but her answers were evasive. She reported the situation to the Mixed Court of the Public Concession. Detective Shen Dehui took Chen Zhou to the police station. Under strict questioning, she finally confessed that she had lured Guihong out and sent her to her younger brother, Zhou Dexing, intending to take her back to their hometown and sell her to a wealthy family to spend the money. Detective Shen then apprehended her younger brother, Zhou Dexing, and detained him as well. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Mr. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, explained the case and requested prosecution, stating that when the police pursued Chen Zhou, her brother, knowing the matter was improper, had someone send the girl back. Subsequently, the Meng girl and her mother testified about the incident. Questioned about the accusations, the two defendants confessed that they were confused and resorted to this desperate measure, begging for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Chen Zhou and Zhou Dexing to six months imprisonment each, but granted a three-year probation considering their ignorance and first offense.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 4:00 PM, four bandits broke into the residence of Wu Jinsheng, a foreign goods broker, at No. 3, Lane 102, Zhangjiazhai Road, Avenue Road in the Public Concession. Two bandits brandished pistols, threatening and rummaging through boxes and chests, arbitrarily looting for about 20 minutes. They stole clothing, ornaments, and approximately two thousand yuan in legal tender. While the bandits were looting, two maids in the house sneaked out through the back door and reported the incident to Chinese Constable No. 1394. The Chinese Constable immediately telephoned the relevant police station. The head of the police station, upon receiving the report, dispatched a large number of armed detectives, who surrounded the house. However, the bandits were unaware that detectives were stationed outside. They carried the stolen goods and rushed out of the door to escape. The detectives bravely stepped forward to arrest them. Seeing a large number of detectives, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives also returned fire. The bandits fired while fleeing. The detectives pursued closely. Two bandits fled to the intersection of Avenue Road and Carter Road, where Western Constable No. 126 shot them down.

The court verified the testimony and questioned the defendant, who confessed that he acted under the influence of alcohol and requested leniency. The court concluded the trial and sentenced Paul Liumsong to 30 days of detention for causing bodily harm, and the hammer was confiscated.</p>

<p>Pan Wenran, 28 years old, a native of Nanhui and a shareholder of the Maofeng and other three cotton firms in Yongning Lane, Henan, married Miss Zhang (23 years old this year) from his hometown three years ago. However, after the marriage, Pan found his wife plain-looking and his feelings for her weak. Therefore, Pan met Deng Lijuan (20 years old), a Suzhou woman who sang local tunes at the Tianyunlou amusement park in Wing On Company, and lived with her at No. 22 Derun Lane, Vermeil Road. They have had children, a boy named Bingnian, who is two years old this year, and a girl named Meimei, who is one year old this year.

<p>The Bao Tai Pawnshop, located at the intersection of Rue de la Mairie and Ba Li Bridge Street in the French Concession, accidentally caught fire around midnight on August 16th of last year, near curfew time, burning a corner of the building. It was insured against fire. Afterwards, the insurance company paid out 60,000 yuan in insurance. However, the pawnshop refused to compensate the customers for their pawned goods. Therefore, 119 customers with 448 pawn tickets elected Yin Shilin, Wang Zengji, and Fang Xiangtai to hire lawyer Ji Chao to represent them and negotiate with Xia Deyang, the owner of Bao Tai Pawnshop, demanding compensation. However, he refused to listen. Lawyer Ji, acting on their behalf, filed a lawsuit against Xia Deyang in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, demanding compensation for damages based on 50% of the pawned value, amounting to 9,265 yuan and 10 cents, and requested legal aid. Judge Yu Changzi ruled to reject the legal aid request and ordered them to pay the court fees within ten days. Now, the customer representatives Yin Wang and Fang have hired lawyer Ji to file a request for mediation of compensation with the Second Special District Court. The court accepted the request, and Judge Shen held a hearing for mediation yesterday afternoon. The customers and the three representatives, along with lawyer Ji, appeared in court. However, the opposing party, Xia Deyang, did not appear, preventing mediation from proceeding. The court declared the mediation unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Women with Strong Emotions Should Not Practice Celibacy Without Authorization</h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Everyone knows the harm of indulgence, but they do not know that celibacy also has its harms. For women with weak sexual desire, celibacy is not difficult. Therefore, they can maintain their single life, pure and flawless, throughout their lives. They also have no physical or mental illnesses. The opposite is true: if the body is very healthy and sexual desire is often aroused, if there is no contact with the opposite sex, celibacy can still be enforced, and diseases will not occur. If, in their youth, they like socializing, read obscene books, or have had contact with the opposite sex, the result of celibacy will inevitably lead to neurosis. Most people suffering from hysteria are caused by this. If they are forced to practice celibacy, they will often do anything, taking an active role to solicit men. All of this is a reaction to celibacy, and it is not surprising. Therefore, women with strong emotions should never practice celibacy without authorization.</p>
<p>Also, when a woman suddenly encounters misfortune, or loses the love of her husband, or her husband travels far away and does not return, she becomes worried and depressed, causing all kinds of illnesses. Therefore, these women are the most tragic.</p>
<p>The above reasons for women to be forced to practice celibacy are often seen in society. But there is something even more tragic that causes women to lose the pleasure of sex, which is the husband's kidney deficiency and illness, and inability to perform sexually, often suffering from premature ejaculation and impotence. Therefore, the love between husband and wife is poor, and there are often quarrels. In severe cases, the wife cannot bear the loneliness and commits adultery, spreading scandalous names everywhere. This not only deprives the woman of the pleasure of marriage, but the man himself also feels that there is no pleasure at all. This is truly an important family problem.</p>
<p>According to a survey by German medical experts, men who are sexually weak account for half of every ten men. Now, to treat this kind of disease, in addition to preventing self-pollution before marriage, one should also practice abstinence after marriage. The function of the sexual mechanism cannot be abandoned or indulged. After indulgence, kidney deficiency is inevitable, and it is difficult to generate love during bed pleasure. Therefore, in order to seek the happiness of both parties, men with kidney deficiency should be treated quickly. If they do not follow the doctor's guidance and abuse aphrodisiacs on the market and supplements similar to aphrodisiacs, not only will they have no effect, but they will increase the disease. Therefore, only the genuine male "Bu Ti Kang" made from male animal testicular essence taken internally can increase sperm and replenish blood, strengthen the brain and consolidate the kidneys, so that symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and spermatorrhea can be cured in a short period of time. This has long been achieved in our clinical experiments and we are happy to introduce it to patients, so that affectionate women will not cause family unhappiness due to their husband's kidney deficiency. This is why "Bu Ti Kang" is highly respected by both the medical and pharmaceutical industries, and is far from comparable to inferior drugs. The female version has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting conception, and is sold in pharmacies.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Annals</p>
<h3>Proving with Ironclad Facts That Leukorrhea Is Easy to Cure</h3>
<p>Many old-fashioned gonorrhea internal medicines and therapies have been proven ineffective by modern expert physicians and patients. Therefore, the research on new therapies is in full swing. Scholars bury themselves in their work and exhaust countless efforts and brainpower, and finally discover a truth about gonorrhea treatment in a test tube, which temporarily shook the medical world and was recognized as the greatest achievement in the treatment of gonorrhea. At that time, I was studying medicine in the United States. I was determined to study it and read all the medical journals published in various countries. I learned that it was a new method based on the latest science, which combines refined pure pigments and proteomes with other pure and powerful bactericidal chemical drugs to make a solution, which is used to soak gonococci, and the gonococci are seen to die quickly.</p>
<p>Many scholars are university professors or gonorrhea specialists. They have also repeatedly tested the agent and proved that it has great efficacy. The gonococci in the test tube's slanted culture medium are usually very active and lively. If this liquid medicine is injected into the test tube, the gonococci will die immediately. Later, Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, took it a step further and made "Klinong" from pure yellow pigment and specially made proteome. From then on, the treatment of gonorrhea opened a new world. All acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as balanitis, prostatitis, cystitis, orchitis in men, and gonorrheal leucorrhea, uterine inflammation, and vaginal gonorrhea in women, can be quickly and fundamentally cured by taking "Klinong", which has long been praised by word of mouth. In venereal disease hospitals in various countries, it is used as a living medicine in gonorrhea internal medicines, and its value is evident. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Carl's Snow Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories. It is even better to treat yourself at home according to the instructions and the instructions ("Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold in both Sino-Western Taihe drugstores) - Written by Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment Before Becoming Consumptive</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing is a precursor to becoming consumptive, so in order to avoid lung disease, it is necessary to treat coughing first. To cure coughing, it is not necessary to consult a doctor. Using effective medicines for self-treatment at home can be as effective as treatment at the doctor's office. Moreover, treatment at home is more convenient than staying in the hospital. Based on my experience of more than 20 years, I have come into contact with countless patients, and the only medicine that can relieve coughs in a short period of time is the sacred medicine for lung disease "Bu Fei Na Yu". The effect of this medicine in relieving coughs is completely based on the cause of the cough, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary and violent anesthetics.</p>
<h3>Cured Case of Spermatorrhea, Spermatorrhea After Abstinence</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Patient Wang Yiqin, from Jiangwan, 25 years old, (self-reported) - When I was young, I was very healthy and liked to read erotic books and paintings, and I liked to talk about the trivial matters between men and women. At the age of 18, I was seduced by my colleagues and went whoring several times, which was excessive. At the age of 23, I suddenly contracted syphilis. After seeking medical treatment, I had more than 6068 injections, and the syphilis was finally cured. Since then, I dared not try whoring again. Even when sexual desire was aroused, I had to try my best to suppress it. Unexpectedly, after a year, spermatorrhea occurred. At first, it was only two or three times a month, but then it gradually increased, and it even occurred two or three times a week. My body gradually weakened, I felt very tired, my brain was weak and forgetful, and I suffered from insomnia at night. I had taken six bottles of tonics and ten injections, but they were not effective. Now that the wedding is imminent, I am writing to you for help from all the doctors. (Cure process) - I was told to take care of myself and take "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" and the German testicular essence preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang". Mr. Wang followed the advice, and after a month, he was full of energy, and there was no more spermatorrhea. After taking it for another month, he gained weight and his health improved day by day.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>Methods for Treating Stubborn Old Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Leukorrhea transitioning from acute to chronic, and further from chronic becoming stubbornly entrenched, once it turns into stubborn old leukorrhea, the gonorrhea patient will undoubtedly find passing these long years to be an exceedingly difficult matter. Therefore, gonorrhea patients, upon hearing of the difficulty in treating stubborn old leukorrhea, feel as if suddenly struck by an electric current, and pronounce their own death sentence. However, with the rapid advancement of medical science today, it is almost progressing at a rate of a thousand miles a day. What was once considered difficult to treat, stubborn old leukorrhea, now has methods to be completely cured! For example, arthritis, which is difficult to cure in gonorrhea, according to my twenty years of research, is not as difficult to treat as generally imagined. I also use the latest scientific methods to first make a detailed diagnosis, to know the extent of this gonorrheal arthritis, and then apply appropriate treatment. Gonorrheal arthritis has a very wide range of involvement, and its onset is different from suppurated arthritis, and different again from arthritis after suppuration. And the most appropriate, comprehensive treatment is to use German anti-gonorrhea serum for intravenous injection. At the same time, use the gonorrhea panacea "Kelinong" as an internal medicine, to make the body produce a general bactericidal effect. In terms of electrotherapy, German Static Electrotherapy and Wettere X-ray therapy can always cure it in a short period of time. Now, I will try to explain the reason as follows: First, because in gonorrheal arthritis, the gonococci travel irregularly, often appearing in one place and then another! They wander aimlessly. However, the swelling and pain at the major joints are greater. Second, "Kelinong" has the power to resist gonococcal bacteriophages. This anti-gonococcal toxin is dispersed throughout the blood, traveling back and forth to destroy the gonococci. The use of static electricity and X-ray electrotherapy, as well as anti-gonorrhea serum, not only have a bactericidal effect, but also decompose the adhered arthritis. Therefore, even if gonorrheal arthritis is about to become a disability, it can be quickly cured. Twenty appointment tickets are given out each day, with each ticket costing only five jiao, and a free book on venereal disease is given away. Also treating syphilis, chancroid, and buboes.</p>

<h3>Finance 香港資金流滬日巨 外匯多頭紛紛轉賣</h3>
<h3>Hong Kong Funds Flow to Shanghai Daily in Huge Amounts, Forex Bulls Sell Off</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The OTC market for British and American currencies was quite tense in the morning, as operators have been paying close attention to Hong Kong's activities in recent days. Yesterday morning, Hong Kong telegraphs had not yet started selling, but around 9:30 AM, there was a sudden wave of selling. Most speculators holding long positions, seeing that Hong Kong funds were flowing to Shanghai in huge amounts daily, felt uneasy. Therefore, to avoid the expansion of short positions, they quickly followed suit and sold, causing the market price to tighten, but eventually reversed and eased. The situation that day: the opening was flat. Subsequently, China Merchants Bank and speculators took the lead in buying, and soon Sassoon also bought. Moreover, foreign banks' willingness to supply was not strong, so the tightening trend was quite rapid at one point. In less than half an hour, the British gold rate shrank to 4 shillings and 6.875 pence, and the US exchange rate fell to 7.625 yuan. Fortunately, a certain American bank strongly sold off February US exchange rates at 7.4375 and 7.5 yuan, in quite large quantities. Later, it relied on Hong Kong telegraphs' continuous selling, and those who initially held long positions, seeing the unfavorable situation, turned to selling, so the positions were suddenly filled, and the market trend eased. By the afternoon, the British gold rate had actually hardened to 4 shillings and 9.375 pence, and the US exchange rate had also risen to 8.09375 yuan. After entering, HSBC saw the cheap price and absorbed, and the situation was slightly calmed. By the evening close, the British gold rate was still at 4 shillings and 9.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate was still at 8.03125 yuan. As a result, compared to last weekend, the British rate eased by 125, and the American rate hardened by 21875. Futures were slightly tight, trending the same as the spot market.</p>
<p>The trend was tight first, then loose.</p>
<p>In the early morning, because London's major lines and the Bank of America's rates were closed for business and there were no telegrams, London's gold price was fixed. The exchange rates of British against American and against French currencies were flat, while against Shanghai, it shrank by 0625. American against British and against French currencies were all flat, while against Shanghai, it was down by 15 cents. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings and 7.8125 pence for the British rate and 7.8125 yuan for the US exchange rate, with no change compared to last weekend. After opening, speculators and China Merchants Bank took the lead in buying, and Sassoon also had a strong buying interest. Moreover, foreign banks' willingness to supply was weak, so the market immediately tightened. By 9:20 AM, the British gold rate had eased to 4 shillings and 6.875 pence, and the US exchange rate had tightened to 7.625 yuan. Fortunately, a certain American bank was still willing to supply, selling February US exchange rates at 7.4375 and 7.5 yuan to Chinese merchants, so the situation was slightly stabilized. HSBC's listed prices were announced and unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced and also showed no increase or decrease. Unexpectedly, Hong Kong telegraphs suddenly started selling, causing people's hearts to change rapidly. Chinese banks and speculators immediately followed suit and sold, and those who had initially entered were also hesitant to move forward. Furthermore, the willingness to sell also increased due to profits, so the market trend immediately eased. By 10:45 AM, the British gold rate had hardened to 4 shillings and 8.75 pence, and the US exchange rate had also risen to 7.9375 yuan. Later, foreign firms made some settlements, and the selling wind gradually subsided, so the situation gradually returned to normal. By the noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 8.4375 pence for the British rate and 7.90625 yuan for the US exchange rate, compared to the morning opening, the British rate eased by 0625, and the American rate hardened by 09375.</p>
<p>The US dollar again exceeded 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The market weakened further because Hong Kong telegraphs again sent telegrams to sell, and Chinese banks such as Jin Cheng and Mainland, as well as general speculators, also continued to sell, so it continued to loosen. The US exchange rate actually went beyond the 8-yuan mark. At that time, Hong Kong telegraphs sold a large amount of January's forward rate at 4 shillings and 9.0625 pence, which were all absorbed by foreign banks such as HSBC and Yuli. At that time, the spot price of the British gold rate eased to 4 shillings and 9.375 pence, and the US exchange rate also hardened to 8.09375 yuan. After entering, HSBC again absorbed China Merchants Bank's spot US exchange rate at 8.0625 yuan, so the situation gradually calmed down. By the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 9.0625 pence for the British gold rate and 8.03125 yuan for the US exchange rate. The British rate for the rest of this month was 4 shillings and 8.90625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 8 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the spot British gold rate tightened by 125, and the US exchange rate eased by 21875. Futures British hardened by 140625, and American rates depreciated by 25.</p>

<h3>短景不長 金市下疲 回入四千一百元關</h3>
<h3>Short-Lived Prosperity, Gold Market Weakens, Falls Back Below 4,100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold OTC market situation: the good times were hard to maintain for long and it relapsed into a selling frenzy. Although a certain major player commissioned a money exchange to bring in more than a thousand taels, due to sluggish real demand from the Hong Kong consortium and the sudden shift from tight to loose foreign exchange, the price ultimately fell by as much as 40 yuan. The morning opened flat at 4,115 yuan, down 7 yuan. Subsequently, due to tight foreign exchange and gold shops buying on behalf of customers, while a certain jewelry store also bought in on behalf of its own group, it once reached a new high for the year of 4,155 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market suddenly reversed, and the loose situation immediately appeared. There was selling and outflow, with a certain gold shop and money exchange/securities group competing the most fiercely. Although a certain jewelry store and a certain major player made a concerted effort to absorb a certain amount, the positions eventually felt abundant. By the afternoon, it had shrunk to a low price of 4,078 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange stabilized slightly, the securities group profited by covering short positions, and it rose back by more than ten yuan, but because the gold shop sold again, the evening close was only 4,082 yuan. The trading volume was brisk throughout the day, with about 2,000 taels changing hands. The result for jewelry gold was unchanged, and the customs and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened flat. First, a money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold shop for 4,115 yuan, which was down 7 yuan from last Saturday's noon close, but still several yuan higher than the previous day's off-exchange price. Shortly after, the foreign exchange market was quite tight, and buying became strong. The order number was that a certain jewelry store bought on behalf of customers, and for a time there were few sellers, so it jumped by 40 yuan. The money exchange bought 10 taels of spot gold from a gold shop for 4,155 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange loosened, the market turned downwards. A certain money exchange tried hard to sell for the long side, and it immediately fell by 35 yuan. The money exchange sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,120 yuan. At this time, a certain number in the securities group suddenly came to buy in, and at the same time a certain money exchange also brought in some, so it once again rose to 4,135 yuan. After that, because the foreign exchange market hardened, there was an endless stream of sales. Jewelry groups, gold shops, and securities groups all scrambled to sell, and for a time there was no support, so it plummeted by 45 yuan. The money exchange sold 30 taels to the securities group for 4,090 yuan. At that time, the gold shop took advantage of the low price to profit and cover short positions, and it immediately rose by 20 yuan. The securities group bought 10 taels from the money exchange for 4,110 yuan. Later, a certain number in the securities group came again to sell heavily, and it was pressed down again to 4,090 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market stopped loosening and stabilized slightly, and buying gradually became stronger. A certain securities group and a certain jewelry store and others came to bring in the gold, and it soon rose back by 27 yuan. The securities group bought 10 taels from the gold shop for 4,117 yuan. Later, the jewelry group, a certain number in the securities group, and others came again to sell, and because those bringing in gold were not strong, it gradually fell by 14 yuan. The securities group sold 20 taels to the money exchange for 4,103 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because the foreign exchange market continued to harden, the situation became increasingly weak, and the price opened down by 13 yuan under the selling pressure from the gold shop. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities group for 4,090 yuan. Later, it fell another 2 yuan, and money exchanges did 30 taels among themselves for 4,088 yuan. Afterwards, because a certain money exchange bought on behalf of the Hong Kong side, it was pulled up by 17 yuan for a time. The money exchange bought 20 taels from the securities group for 4,105 yuan. After that, the Hong Kong group was satisfied with its fill, and the foreign exchange market continued to loosen, and gold shops and money exchanges came again to sell, and it could no longer be supported and fell. Money exchanges did 20 taels among themselves for 4,078 yuan. Then, as the securities group profited by covering short positions, and the foreign exchange market stopped loosening and stabilized slightly, it rose back by a small 7 yuan. The jewelry group sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,095 yuan. Later, because a certain gold shop saw the high price and sold again, it fell again by 13 yuan. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the securities group for 4,082 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell 40 yuan compared to last weekend, with a fluctuation of 77 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold number's own brand gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold First Rises, Then Falls</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael: initially, the major dealers still hung at 415 yuan. By 9:35 AM, it was raised by 5 yuan, but in less than half an hour it fell back by 5 yuan. After that, there was no change. As a result, the major dealers still hung at 415 yuan. The new dealers had the same price as above, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Supply Exceeds Demand, Foreign Currencies Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were initially flat, then loosened. The supply of British and American gold pounds increased, and the market situation tended to loosen. The American gold note was 13.03 yuan in the morning, but due to the strong supply, the market price fell frequently, and the evening market dropped to 12.53 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong notes was also smooth, and the market situation was weak. Singapore notes and Dutch notes were rarely needed, and the market price fell. Canadian notes also fell due to the frequent drop in the American gold note. The demand for Japanese gold notes was slightly strong, and the market situation was slightly firm, with the evening market at 1.27 yuan. Korean notes were weak, with the evening market at 1.075 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold notes fell by 20 cents, American gold notes fell by 30 cents, Hong Kong notes fell by 2 cents, Singapore notes and Dutch notes both fell by 10 cents, Canadian notes fell by 20 cents, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange rose slightly. The rate immediately rose to 35 yuan per thousand yuan in the early morning, and then rose further to 37 yuan. (But it soon fell back to 34.5 yuan, and stood firm at 35 yuan in the afternoon, which was up 1 yuan compared to last Saturday. The money industry association's interbank lending rate was still hung at 15 cents in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>Securities 外股創造 新紀錄日 堅昂竟成白熱化</h3>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Create a New Record Day, Firm and High Prices Turn White-Hot</h3>
<p>Yesterday's OTC securities market situation was slightly volatile. Because there was quite a bit of profit-taking, the market price was under pressure and the rising wind was slightly frustrated. It was heard that the Nanjing rumors were a tactic to pressure for peace talks, and that the real purpose was to seek peace and a ceasefire. In the morning, buying sentiment was initially very strong and the market price was firm. Later, Xinfu and No. 14 selling off slightly caused some weakness. The afternoon situation was roughly the same as the morning. Xinfu still had some selling, and Dafeng and Tongkang also sold off. However, Lemao, Lianyi, Lianhe, and others were still constantly absorbing, and the market situation was slightly firmer again. The future may go through a short period of volatility before rising again. As a result, apart from Dingzhong, which was down by a small 2 cents, the rest were good by about 1 or 2 cents. The transaction volume was about more than 1 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 20 shares of Ningbo Shaoxing Shipping Company were traded at a price of 8.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Industry Association opened firmly and tensely, reaching a boiling point. As time went on, it became more and more intense, and the emotions of the crowd turned white-hot. All the stocks on the board were scrambling to be taken, so it would not be an exaggeration to call it "New Record Day" since trading began. As noon approached, a reaction suddenly arose. It was a very natural action for lucky longs to settle all their positions in order to obtain the profits they had already earned. The pullback extended in the afternoon. At that time, those most affected were also those who had risen the most during the rising period. The ratios of various high-priced stocks were relatively stable. The trading volume of various stocks was very common, so it is not easy and unnecessary to list the stocks that benefited the most for comparison.</p>
<h3>Food 常幫高粳 始售限價 碎米平價出售</h3>
<h3>Food: Chang Gang High-Quality Japonica Rice Begins Sales with Price Limits, Broken Rice Sold at Discounted Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's inland sources, transferred out of Hongkou, suddenly became sparse, with only three to five hundred bags. The amount of foreign rice arriving was also not large. In the early morning, people's hearts were still floating, and most remained in a wait-and-see attitude, with few inquiring. The merchants also did not lightly sell due to their own capital constraints. The price did not rise or fall under the insistence of the sellers. Near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange continued to shorten, and the cost of foreign rice became heavier, so those who owned foreign rice became firmer in their thinking and were unwilling to sell. Customers also successively made offers, and at this point the market rose. However, because the stock in the warehouses was abundant, it was difficult to fully raise the prices of various goods. If Japonica and National rice only improved by 20 or 30 cents, Chang Gang high-quality Japonica rice began to limit sales to 40 yuan. Various types of foreign rice depended on the transfer of foreign exchange, increasing by 30 to 50 cents compared to the previous market. Only glutinous rice had a large amount of stock in the warehouses and sluggish sales, so it continued to be dumped for more than one yuan.</p>
<p>There was also foreign rice arriving in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship transported 450 bags from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 7th), and the Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship loaded 4,322 bags from Hong Kong. The unloading of both ships was completed yesterday. (Zu)</p>
<p>Also, foreign rice orders are still difficult to reconcile. Wholesale spot goods still need to wait a little longer, but inland rural customers are asking about them, so Saigon No. 1 rice and others have already been raised by 20 or 30 cents. No. 1 rice opens at 36.2 yuan, and original bags for return are still opened at 43.75 yuan. However, there are more orders for broken rice, and the inventory is sufficient. Moreover, the sale of discounted rice has been decided to start on the tenth day of the lunar December according to the old calendar. Several rice shops in the French Concession are selling discounted broken rice (156 catties) for 28 yuan. It is heard that high-quality broken rice in the market is also only sold for 32 yuan, and the price of inferior goods is the same as the discounted price, down by 50 or 60 cents compared to the day before.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The current flour market is trending firm. Although the price of No. 2 flour mill remains at the original price of 9 yuan, there is a significant difference from the customer price, so the mill is only willing to supply small quantities, and larger quantities are restricted. The total market turnover is less than 10,000 bags. The customer sales price of various brands such as Green Cannon and Tianzhu remains at 9.45 to 9.5 yuan. There is little supply and demand for returned goods, and the price is also similar. The market situation for Japanese flour has improved slightly. The price of Phoenix brand in January reached 9.056 yuan last weekend, and has now returned to around 9.2 yuan. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is slightly sporadic. Because the producers' prices are not loose, transportation is very difficult, and most are unwilling to lightly sell. Also, according to foreign firm news, the Australian government is planning to restrict wheat production, and the exchange rate fluctuates greatly, so it is feared that it will be difficult to start ordering wheat in the future, so people's hearts are still firm and the selling price is difficult to lower. Changxi wheat is still standing at the original price of 15.5 yuan, with 2,000 bags taken by Fufeng Factory and 300 bags taken by Fuxin Factory. It is heard that there was also a transaction of a tube of warehouse receipts in the market, with the Changzhou wheat price opened at 14.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Yellow Soybeans Continue to Rise by More Than One Corner</h3>
<p>The yellow soybean market situation: due to transportation difficulties and high costs, the source of high-quality goods is scarce, and most are mid-to-low-quality goods, so the landed price is firm and the market price rises more and falls less. Yesterday's market continued to rise by more than one corner, with over 1,600 bags of Dingjiazhou beans opened at a price of 18 to 18.5 yuan, 2 cars of Nanjing beans at a price of 17 to 17.15 yuan, 300 bags of Wuhu beans at a price of 18.1 yuan, over 100 bags of Taicang beans at a price of 18.2 yuan, and 37 bags of Chongming sand yellow at a price of 18.4 yuan, 50 bags of Pinghu Doudou at a price of 20.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported raw oil: 1,690 cans arrived from Qingdao yesterday. Today (the 9th), 1,600 bags of beans, 400 bags of peanuts, 5,090 bags of raw kernels, 4,500 cans of raw oil, and 70 items are being transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Uninspired, Cotton Sales Quiet</h3>
<p>The transaction of native cotton has turned quiet. Factories need to lower prices and cannot bear it, which is really due to the lack of yarn sales and the uninspired market price. As a result, the buying interest is not healthy. Only Qingdao's Japanese factories have some purchases and shipments, so the market situation is still stable. Currently, the cotton market is restricted because the yarn price has a tendency to decrease, and the raw cotton, which is related to it, is of course restricted. From the source in northern Jiangsu, 4,068 bags of Tonghua and 942 bags of Changyinsha arrived in two days. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 162.00 Transactions among merchants 150 bags</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 163.00 Also 160 bags</p>
<p>Fire Machine Wooden Frame 164.00 Also 150 bags</p>
<p>Fire Machine 163.50 Also 140 bags</p>
<p>Chong Tong 166.25 150 bags</p>
<p>Fire Machine Wooden Frame 162.00 Also 150 bags</p>
<p>American Cotton 177.00 Also 100 bags</p>
<p>Tongzhou 172.00 Also 1,000 bags</p>
<p>Also 171.50 Also 300 bags</p>
<p>American 176.00 Also 200 bags</p>
<p>In addition, the market price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market opened firm yesterday morning, first due to purchases by speculators, then due to enthusiastic purchases by the industry and some short covering. As a result, the closing price increased by 20 points for the near term and more than 10 points for the long term. The Indian market, including forecasts, increased by 2 rupees, and the Egyptian market increased by more than 20 points. Liverpool was closed.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai is still extremely quiet. They are deeply afraid that there will be changes in the exchange rate. However, various opinions are unanimously optimistic about the overseas cotton market, and the intention for American cotton is especially firm. Therefore, trading New York American cotton New York futures among peers is very prosperous. The Japanese factory also has a high opinion on American cotton. The price of yesterday's cotton market converted to a factory delivery price using the American exchange rate of 8 yuan is as follows.</p>
<p>20 counts American Metlin 238.20</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade 233.95</p>
<p>32 counts Also 245.05</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade 239.05</p>
<p>42 counts Also 248.45</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade 240.75</p>
<h3>Sellers Congregated, Yarn Market Wanted to Rise but Fell</h3>
<p>The yarn market first rose and then fell, and the trend is weakening. Because customer sales have stagnated, and the stock in the hands of hoarders has increased. As for the foreign exchange situation, there is also a kind of fluctuating situation. In this short period of time, there will not be a new posture found. However, although the thinking of the general industry is strong, time in and time out, it is all January and February futures, and the trading of 20-count Shuangma is very lively. The transaction of current yarn has almost completely stopped. It is found that the Hong Kong gang only took care of 10 bags of cotton yarn, and the industry's skin ball transaction was said to be outside of 1,200 bags.</p>
<p>The current yarn morning opening continued the firm gas of the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 740 yuan. However, as soon as this price opened, sellers gathered, and the general flow of scalpers, seeing that the chips in the market were abundant, the public were shorting the heads. The market price turned downwards again. It was heard that the foreign exchange was shortening and lengthening again, and people's hearts were even more empty, and real sales were even more sluggish. It fell directly to 727 yuan at the close. The transaction statistics for half a day were 1,385 bags. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 1 yuan, Tiannv fell by 2 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu fell by 2 yuan. Today, 10 pieces of yarn are being transported to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang that bought is divided as follows.</p>
<p>Industry 1,210 Mainland 70</p>
<p>Tianjin 75 Hong Kong 10</p>
<p>Statistics 1,385</p>
<h3>Textiles 实销仍佳</h3>
<h3>Textiles: Actual Sales of Cotton Cloth Still Good</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth: the market mentality and business are not prosperous due to the unstable exchange rate, but the actual sales situation is very good, so the market situation is first weak and then firm. White cloth and coarse cloth of heavy weight increased by 10 to 20 cents per bolt, and light weight was flat. Scattered lots of ready-made fine cloth were sold cheaply at 10 to 25 cents per bolt. The increase and decrease of fine twill were mixed. The prices of bleached, dyed, and printed cloths were all firm due to the continued increase in processing fees. The North Road Tianjin and Yantai gangs took care of more than 200 pieces of blue cloth and fine cloth, and the Nanyang gang took care of more than 10,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. In this street, more than 500 pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, fine cord, and printed cloth were transacted. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs took care of more than 5,000 bolts of colored cloth, line flannel, and colored twill, and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi gangs took care of 70 to 80 pieces of bleached cloth, fine cloth, and twill. On the 9th, 47 pieces of textiles were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Dongbu cloth rose in the morning and weakened at noon. When the market closed, fine cloth rebounded, resembling the sales situation of the previous week. Fine twill decreased slightly by 5 to 10 cents per bolt. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a peak of 22.25 yuan in the morning, and once fell to 21.8 yuan in the afternoon. The closing price rose back to 22.05 yuan. More than 700 pieces of fine cloth were transacted in this street. The opening price of Four Gentlemen Serge was 67.5 cents per yard in the morning, and also fell to around 67 cents afterwards, because customer sales were not prosperous and transactions were few.</p>
<h3>平厚呢下檔見俏</h3>
<h3>Smooth Thick Wool Fabric Lower Grades Are Popular</h3>
<p>Smooth thick wool fabric sales are still good, and the lower grades, from 7 to 8 yuan up to less than 10 yuan, are even more popular. Yuan color is especially good, because uniform manufacturers are coming one after another. The price of overcoat wool fabric is high, so this is the only choice. Although the need for thick smooth wool fabric is lively, it is not as popular as the lower grades.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea 絲市前途 關係微妙</h3>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Future of the Silk Market is Subtly Related</h3>
<p>After the opening of customs, the silk market in Japan and the United States once showed a decline. At the same time, according to the New York silk statistics for last month, it was felt that the New York silk market in December, regardless of imports, sales, or stocks, had shrunk compared to the previous month and the same month of the previous year, so some people generally believed that the foundation of the recent high silk price was very fragile, and therefore predicted that the silk price would gradually return. However, yesterday the Yokohama silk market rose sharply again, with spot at 2,320 yuan, up 40 yuan, near-term at 2,320 yuan up 90 yuan, and long-term at 2,360 yuan up 61 yuan. At present, the rise and fall of the silk price cannot be regarded as a single cause or phenomenon. Because war has caused production to shrink, and at the same time caused prices to soar, raw silk is no exception, and will follow this trend to become deeper and deeper. Moreover, silk is especially subtly related to the commercial treaties of Japan and the United States, and the changes are very complicated. The local silk market is in a firm and stable state, with the price of European sales of white factory at 6,300 yuan, with only 5 piculs transacted. Qianjin Silk, printed and sold by White Head Foreign Firm, opened yesterday at 80 piculs, with the price up 20 yuan, and the selling price was 1,820 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Shows Slight Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign sugar saw an increase due to foreign exchange rates, showing a slight decrease. The association's price was fixed at $58.50 for spot coarse white sugar from domestic warehouses, $58 for newly arrived sugar from foreign warehouses, $57.80 to $57.70, and a small amount at $0.50 for old stock, $47 for re-export sugar, a small amount at $1. The Swire Crystal White B mark was $59 at the eastern warehouse and $59.50 at the western warehouse, up $0.20, with the remainder subject to rebate. The H mark was slightly tight, $43.80 at the western warehouse and $43.50 at the eastern warehouse. Dutch Red was a small amount at $0.50, MP mark at $45.50, WA mark at $45. Native cotton white No. 1 was $57.50, No. 2 was $57, a small amount at $0.50. Native ice sugar prices remained the same, No. 1 at $68, No. 2 at $67.50, crystal clear ice at $69.50. According to customer telegrams, native brown sugar should be temporarily held and not exchanged, so the market is tightening again. Yesterday, several dozen bags of Swire ship cargo were released, rising again to $45. Ordinary Huizhou White was $53.80. Five thousand bags of sugar arrived from the Netherlands on the 8th, and 570 bags from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Spring Round Logans Face Renewed Obstruction</h3>
<p>Due to the obstruction of ships going to Quanzhou, the source of assorted longans has been cut off again. Now only Zhangzhou has a small amount of goods arriving. However, because the production price is not very suitable, the arrival of goods is extremely scarce. It was found that the number of Xinjiang wheel shipments last Friday was less than ten boxes. The price is still expected to continue to tighten.</p>
<h3>Coal: Vietnamese Coal Rises Another Seven Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, each type of bituminous coal has been affected by Kai Ping, and high-grade goods have been above $100, making it difficult for shops and stores to start. Secondary goods took the opportunity to rise and sell very well. Yesterday, Vietnamese coal was unpacked by the trade, rising another $7 per ton. According to the warehouse, Vietnamese general coal is $75 per ton from the car, with additional handling fees for delivery.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>The tinplate market was previously prosperous in trading, and prices rose. Recently, however, yarn factories and rolling mills have not had much interest, causing the market to become sluggish. Currently, 24-gauge goods sell for $800 per box, and 26-gauge goods sell for $320 per box, both of which are more than $100 lower than before.</p>

<h3>How to Talk?</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>What to talk about in the Free Talk section was roughly mentioned last time. Now, it's time to discuss how to talk.</p>
<p>More than three years ago, Mr. Lin Yutang introduced the term "Western magazine article" to the Chinese publishing industry. This term was quite unfamiliar in China at the time, almost with a sense of mystery. Later, some translated articles of Western magazine articles were often published in magazines, and everyone gradually understood what Western magazine articles were, and also expressed warm welcome to them.</p>
<p>Western magazine articles represent a free style of writing, with no fixed style as the style. Precisely because there is no fixed writing style, it reveals a lively and natural writing style.</p>
<p>The good thing about Western magazine articles is that the content is rich, the words are meaningful, not perfunctory, not irresponsible, and the style is as lively as close friends talking heart to heart, full of fun.</p>
<p>This forms an interesting contrast with the attitude of some magazines and newspapers in China, which put on a serious face to teach. The stereotyped articles are boring and make people厭厭, writing them is equivalent to not writing.</p>
<p>Foreign authors often spend a lot of time writing an article, doing on-the-spot investigation, looking through reference books, and interviewing relevant people, and then organizing the materials obtained, so they can write rich feature articles. It is not to say that every Western magazine article is so good, but we think this point is what we should humbly learn.</p>
<p>In this regard, we hope that Free Talk can be a pioneer and take this path. We hope that every article, no matter how long or short, will be meaningful. We hope that every author will practice the words "Free Talk" when writing articles.</p>
<p>How to talk? Free Talk, but please don't talk nonsense!</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Scientists Mobilize</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>In a well-organized country, every citizen has the opportunity to dedicate himself to serving the country during wartime, especially scientists, who can be said to be an extremely important force in the nation's entire war effort. After the outbreak of this European war, many British scientists rose up and voluntarily requested the government to assign wartime service work. It is said that the number of registered people recently has reached more than 10,000, all waiting for the government to allocate research topics according to their respective specialties.</p>
<p>War can sometimes be the best stimulant for science, and many scientific inventions are not easily successful in peacetime. The most urgently needed invention in this war is a luminescent substance for use in basements during blackouts. There is also a "light filter" to prevent light from leaking out of the room, which are all necessary equipment for air defense. In addition, due to the shortage of gasoline sources, the increase in the efficiency of aircraft and automobile engines and the improvement of fuel are also extremely important issues. The invention of an extremely light metal can greatly expand the power of aircraft; the invention of an extremely violent explosive, of course, is more practical for war. There are many other important studies that are being actively carried out by specialized scientists.</p>
<p>In case too many people are mobilized and there is not enough research work to allocate, the government is determined not to repeat the mistakes of 1914, allowing groups of talented and outstanding young scientists to join the army out of righteous indignation, only to be tragically destroyed by the ruthless artillery fire and bullets. The most famous victim in the First World War was physicist Moseley, who was only twenty-eight years old and had a brilliant and promising future in X-ray research. Even now, the scientific community still feels deeply sorry for this matter.</p>
<p>There is also a magnificent potential force in the British "scientist army," which is the many Jewish refugees who have been exiled from Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. They are all specialized talents with unusually rich knowledge and experience, and they will surely make great contributions to the countries fighting for justice.</p>
<p>In Germany, the situation is just the opposite. During the First World War, a "non-Aryan" scientist named Fritz Haber invented the great nitrogen synthesis method, which solved Germany's explosive panic, allowing her to continue to support herself on the battlefield for a long time. However, this great contributor was later inevitably subjected to the cruel treatment of the Nazi rulers, so that he suffered from wandering in a foreign land in his later years and died in Switzerland in 1934. Now, the extent of Germany's wartime resource depletion is no less than it was during the last World War, but many Habers have long been voluntarily sent away by Hitler.</p>
<p>Professor J. C. Philip, chairman of the industrial chemistry department of the Scientists' Central Registration Office, expressed optimism about the war, believing that Britain also has a great advantage in terms of the strength of the scientific army. Someone asked him what amazing performances scientists would have in this war. He smiled and replied: "The last World War was when chemists invented poison gas, which caused a sensation for a while. Now, I'm afraid it's time for physicists to show their skills!"</p>

<h3>The Ladder to Success</h3>
<p>— Jia Li</p>
<p>Here are a few questions that can make us more useful people. The ancients said: "The plan for a year lies in the spring." Now is the right time, why don't we introspect ourselves every day in order? I think there will be unexpected results soon. Try it?</p>
<p>Step 1: Have a fixed goal</p>
<p>(1) Where is your life purpose?</p>
<p>(2) What is the first step in the process?</p>
<p>(3) Why don't you do it now?</p>
<p>Step 2: Be good at using time</p>
<p>(1) What did you have to do today that you didn't do?</p>
<p>(2) Why did you put it aside?</p>
<p>(3) When are you going to do it?</p>
<p>(4) Are you going to do it tomorrow?</p>
<p>Step 3: Strive for progress</p>
<p>(1) What knowledge do you need to further your career?</p>
<p>(2) When are you going to start learning?</p>
<p>(3) How much time do you spend outside of office hours to study the business you manage or the things you hope to pursue?</p>
<p>(4) What kind of history, biography, or business book are you reading now?</p>
<p>(5) How many of these kinds of books have you read in the past year?</p>
<p>(6) What cars do you feel uninterested in and put them aside?</p>
<p>(7) If you dropped out of school before, what methods are you using to make up for it now?</p>
<p>Step 4: Be humble and introspect</p>
<p>(1) What mistakes did you make today?</p>
<p>(2) What mistakes did you make more than once last month?</p>
<p>(3) Did you get angry with your colleagues today?</p>
<p>(4) Do you have any attitudes that should be changed but you don't know it? Are you willing to humbly ask your friends to tell you?</p>
<p>(5) Did you do anything rude today?</p>
<p>(6) Did you hinder anyone today?</p>

<h3>Gifts</h3>
<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>Without the red candles of New Year's Eve to render a lively atmosphere, the quiet night becomes the interval between years.</p>
<p>In the early morning, faint sunlight shines on the table. The empty calendar rack is full of thick piles again. It quietly tells me a message: "1940 is here." "Another year." Casting back with an inquiring gaze, I muttered to myself blankly.</p>
<p>A friend sent a gift: a half-inch long glass camel. It was like a oar brushing across the lake of my memory, rippling a circle of childhood ripples. I smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>There is also a short note: "The camel is a product of the sandy land. It carries heavy loads and trudges, enduring hunger and thirst to rush to a distant journey. That perseverance is what we should remember. Now, a new string of days is placed in front of you. Are you welcoming it with joy or sighing? You know, living is difficult. And living in this cold world requires even more courage and perseverance to fight. Be a camel, go to the desert and I will find your oasis. If you put this little thing on your desk, will you remember the kind camel bell sound? A sound can carry nearly an inch of return journey."</p>
<p>What makes me dazed is the seemingly irrelevant tail. Ah, the sound of camel bells. I miss the days in the north. I am already tired of the life in this city, which lacks the essential elements to make life happy: a kind of mood or a little flavor.</p>
<p>But good dreams have gone with the flowing water, and I can't go home. The ancient city has suffocated. Silently, the sun climbed one step past. How will I grasp these flying days?</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>The Qualification to Be Killed</h3>
<p>— Kong Siwen</p>
<p>British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has been traveling between Shanghai and Chongqing recently, with great haste. He is probably one of the busiest people in the world.</p>
<p>Someone asked Ambassador Kerr how he came to China in the first place. He said that Eden, the then British Foreign Secretary, was a good friend of his. He was originally a minister in Iraq, where his official duties were very leisurely. He asked Eden to send him to a place where there was more to do. Unexpectedly, Eden listened to him and sent him to China. Being a diplomat in China can be said to have no free time. Ambassador Kerr said here, saying: "I really got it! I really got it!" There is a great sense of "being fooled! Being fooled!"</p>
<p>Kerr is a talkative and humorous person. After the outbreak of this European war, several British youths volunteered to return home to serve as reservists, preparing to participate in the European war. A friend smiled and asked Kerr: "Are you going?" He replied half-seriously and half-jokingly: "They are just the right age to be killed. I am too old and do not have the qualification to be killed." The humor is mixed with great pain.</p>
<h3>Talking Pieces</h3>
<p>— Shi Ding</p>
<p>According to the Rengo news agency in Geneva, another 147 League of Nations staff members have lost their jobs.</p>
<p>From January 1, 1940, Hungary has no meat to eat every Monday and Friday. Self-inflicted, human beings are really stupid things!</p>
<p>The number of crimes in London has decreased sharply due to the war, the lowest in 25 years. Is there any benefit to war?</p>
<p>American explorer Colonel Byrd, on his way to Antarctica, passed through the Laba area and discovered that the local residents did not know that the European war had already broken out, which was considered a strange thing. It is interestingly juxtaposed with the fact that German prisoners only learned that they were not in military exercises after being captured.</p>

<h3>Northern Kunling Decides to Review (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Prelude</p>
<p>Kunling is now as "popular" as famous actors. This trend started in Jiangnan, but recently it is also the case in the north. There is a great half of the world of Kunling.</p>
<p>Talk about the past first</p>
<p>Before Chen Delin and Yang Xiaolou died, although they were in their sixties, they still relied on their old age to sell their seniority, and they could make money by relying on the word "old" precisely because they were male actors. Kun actors, on the other hand, change slightly every five years and greatly every ten years. Their reputation and status change infinitely with age. Speaking of the Kun actors in the north, Jin Shaomei, Qin Xuefang, and Bi Yunxia were an era; after Shaomei and Xuefang, it was Zhang Eyun, Xin Yanqiu, Hua Huilin, and Du Liyun. Among these four people, Eyun and Yanqiu's art is more than twice as good as Huilin and Liyun. Now Liyun has long been named and Huilin has lived in Jiangnan for a long time and does not often appear on stage. Among the Kun actors in the north, in terms of qualifications, it can be said that each has its own merits. Eyun is better at martial arts actresses and flower actresses, and Yanqiu is good at acting in Tsing Yi plays. However, Eyun has good luck, so for several years, Zhang Eyun seems to be more popular than Xin Yanqiu. In recent years, Xin Yanqiu has not often performed, and Eyun has come to the south several times, and Eyun's limelight has become stronger than hers invisibly. After them, Lu Sujuan is the only popular person who has risen. Sujuan has the reputation of "the first beauty", and she became popular because of her beauty. Her art cannot be compared with Zhang Wang. From 1933 to 1937, it was Lu Sujuan's golden age. Now she has been taken in by a banker in a golden house. Outside of Sujuan, there is also Liang Xiujuan, who was also popular for a while. Now Xiujuan is also a wife. These have become figures of the past era.</p>
<p>Talk about the present again</p>
<p>The Kun actors who are popular in the north now can be divided into two factions, one is to make money with real art, and the other is to call for money with social skills; those who make money with real art include Wang Yurong and Zhao Xiaolan. Yurong and Xiaolan both rely on a good voice and use singing as a gimmick. Yurong is a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, and Xiaolan is a disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. Xiaolan learns Xiaoyun too much. Although she can sing, her accent is too vulgar and her words are not very pleasant to the ear. Yurong, on the other hand, was personally taught by Yaoqing. Yaoqing really used her brains to teach her plays, and she also worked hard to learn the plays. In the past five years, she has achieved some achievements in art. Moreover, she has several dozen well-costumed plays in her stomach. She has good supporting actors and good fans. In addition, Yurong is versatile and good at socializing; therefore, she has become the most popular Kun actor in the north. As for those who call for money with social skills, they are Wu Suqiu and Zhao Jinrong. Wu and Zhao are both leading actors in the north. Wu Suqiu is indeed a smart child, but her acting path is too mixed. She is equipped with plays by Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, and she also performs plays such as "Baluo and", "Spinning Cotton", and "Human Face Peach Blossom" that the four famous actors do not perform, making the audience confused. However, her appearance is quite good and she is good at acting. This is her good point. Zhao Jinrong's art is actually better than Suqiu's. In the drama school, she was originally the only female actor talent, but after leaving school, she was not as good as she was in school. The biggest problem is that her voice cannot be guaranteed. However, Jinrong's foundation is good, and if she can do well, there is still hope for the future. Unfortunately, she is now more focused on socializing than on reality.</p>

<h3>Pot Qi Opera Talk</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Listening to Guan Dayuan sing "Scolding Cao" on New Year's Day</p>
<p>It is not pleasant to listen to the play of Drum Scolding Cao on New Year's Day! That night, I listened to her singing very well, especially unexpectedly happy. Guan Dayuan is a rather old actor. She has not come to Shanghai to perform for more than ten years. She has been on stage at the renewal for more than half a month now. I heard that the reputation is still good. I watched her fight Taiping the other day. Her posture with the halberd has its merits, but I was not satisfied with the singing. Now, I listened to her Drum Scolding Cao, which is based on the Tan school and does not deviate from the general score. However, there are slight differences in the wording, and it does not contain the sad and sad tone of the current trend. It can be proved that her foundation is very deep, she is upright and does not bother to imitate others to please the times. I have tried to test that Mi Zhengping died at the hands of Huang Zu at the age of only twenty-four. He was only twenty-three years old when he saw Cao Cao. He was energetic and arrogant. When the current so-called Tan school famous actors sing this, they deliberately make a sound of dying autumn, without any vigor. It is straight as an old man who is about to decay, how can it be Mi Zhengping who scolds Cao at the risk of his life? The singer has never dreamed of Mi Zheng's shadow, which is a great disease of opera. In the early years of the Republic of China, I watched Tan Xinpei sing this play in Ping. At that time, Tan was already more than seventy years old. Although the drum skills were good, I still felt that the singing was not satisfactory. Later, I saw Luo Xiaobao perform this at the Gong Wu Stage. His power was still strong enough to watch. Now, I see Dayuan's play, which can be compared with Xiaobao. It is not perfect, but it is better than others who are weak and use crying as scolding. If he has a good voice, then his achievements will be more than this. Listening to the "xiang" character of "丞相" and the "kaixiao" two characters of "怎開消" are very satisfactory. The "er" character of "駡賊名兒" is a single cavity, not very exquisite. Watching him beat the drums, his right wrist is very active, and his left wrist does not match. The tao dianzi of the three drum passes and the jiejiegao of the night deep are not boutiques. This is the general idea.</p>
<h3>European Situation</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Since the opening of the European war, the production policies of Hollywood film companies have been quite hesitant: on the one hand, they are unwilling to give up lighthearted love comedies, and at the same time, they are also concerned about the needs of the market. "Entertainment Circle" published a translation last year, and the Hollywood producers with "business eyes" are very clever to take both approaches. At the same time, these two types of films are being produced. "European Situation" was the earliest to be completed.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the "European Situation" produced naturally did not directly touch on the internal causes of the war, nor did it make an accurate perspective. Like other "spy films," it only narrates the struggle of spies from the belligerent countries.</p>
<p>However, the director's handling skills are very clever. After the first new machine crashed, it unfolded intricately, Scottish Detective Han Meng engaged in the investigation of secrets; driver Tony's suspicion; and the enemy assassinated the spy because there was no new discovery on the plane; at the same time, it was also interspersed with a romance between a female reporter and Tony. Under the cross development of these several aspects, the director was able to handle them in a layered manner without the disadvantages of attending to one thing and losing sight of the other, and also tightly grasped the upsurge of the climax. At the same time, in order to adjust the dryness, he poured a very strong interest into the role of Han Meng.</p>
<p>Laurence Voss's Allie Tony is only competent. Ralph Richardson's Han Meng, reversing the style of "Four Feathers", can be said to be very brilliant in playing such a humorous role.</p>
