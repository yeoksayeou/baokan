<h3 id="c14">歐洲的新變動 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>這是清算歷史上的老賬嗎？還是播種了未來的禍根？試看最近數日，國際於中日與英德兩組戰爭之外，又發生種種重要的新變動；雖曰各有其舊淵源，然在平時，大約非戰爭不能解決，而現在則進展於不流血之中。如在巴爾幹方面，羅馬尼亞綫割地於蘇聯，而保加利亞與匈牙利茲亦向羅國提出疆界問題；蓋第一次歐戰之後，羅馬尼亞自蘇聯得了比薩拉比亞，自保國得了南多勃羅柴，自匈國得了德蘭斯斐尼亞與布柯維亞，這些皆是目前成為問題的領土。又如在菠蘿的海方面，愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，與立陶宛三國，茲皆建立蘇維埃政府，而向蘇聯請求歸併；他們原屬俄羅斯帝國，及第一次歐戰時，帝俄經革命崩潰了之後，相繼獨立，成為民主共和國，到現在不足二十年。自此新變動，羅馬尼亞國驟然縮小而陷於極貧極弱，且與英國反目而投入德國懷抱，自難自行把握其國家的命運；影響所及，巴爾幹半島內的團結，自此消失，環境外的均勢自此打破。至於愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞與立陶宛，在他們國會自決的方式，代表團赴莫斯科呈請的手續之下，不復成為獨立國家；影響所及，使第一次歐戰後，歐洲小國林立的局面為之改觀；使蘇聯更增加了［領土六十萬餘方英里，人口六百餘萬，不凍海岸綫海港七百五十英里］（據路透社所計）；使歐洲諸強爭霸的種種客觀條件，因此消長變化。</p>
<p>世界各方面對於上述新變動的反應，洵有其見仁見智之殊，輿情不一；義國因［波羅的海沿岸諸國並非意大利直接利益範圍之一部］而表示其冷淡。德國自此與蘇聯接壤的界綫甚長，利害關係不衹一端，但因對英作戰，遂視蘇聯行動如無覩，置三國投蘇聯於不聞。英國對德作戰，因對蘇聯有不絕如縷的希望，殆將暫守沉默。惟美國由代理國務卿威爾斯發言指責，其言略曰；美國人反對掠奪行為，並反對任何強大國家干涉任何弱小自主國家的內政，上項原則為南北美洲二十一個自主共和國關係的基礎；美國人民均深信除非此項原則能　續遵守，則無合理公平及法律之統治，換言之，除非此項原則能　續遵守，則現代文化之基礎無法保存之。其言富有正義感，自為美國國際政策的基調；亦因其國務卿赫爾方代表美國，出席於泛美會議，謀美洲國家緊密合作；故威爾斯所宣告，一面對歐洲新變動有抗議性質，一面對於在彼羽翼下的美洲弱小友邦，有所告慰，促進赫爾的偉大使命。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞疆域問題，雖謂第一次歐戰結束時，戰勝者未能澈底探行民族自決原則的當然結果，亦無不可。</p>
<p>波羅的海沿岸三國問題，因緣至為複雜，就其尤著者言之：其一，問題不始於現在，亦即不始於數星期來，三國國會的改選，政府的改組，而始於去年蘇聯與三國締結協定，進駐紅軍。蓋一個獨立國家，絕對沒有理由，可以容許強鄰在國境之內，駐紮軍隊；委屈容許之後，積威積勢，不但主權喪其完整，行政動受牽制，且使其人民不復能維持其自信自尊；必然的影響及於政治，不復能維持其自主。三國當初的委屈，豈不曰即所以求全，終於國會改選，政府改組，終於國旗改色；然則三國不復成為獨立國家，並非突然，亦非偶然；他們對岸的芬蘭，迄今屹然，可為反證。第二，歐洲的一般變局，使沒有定識的人們，喪失了定力；蓋事實所示，強權第一，小國岌岌自危，於是心理上適應了［近朱者赤近墨者黑］的法則，形勢上造成了［為淵敺魚，為業敺爵］的趨向，三國介乎蘇聯與德國之間，實逼處此，自不能無所選擇。於是言之，三國一般人民的遭遇，誠屬不勝同情；然美國所尊重的合理公平法律的統治，所尊重的現代文化的基礎，所反對的掠奪，所反對的任何強大國家干涉任何弱小自主國家的內政，徒發高論，有類空言，誠何益於世變？若至國會改選了，政府改組了，自動派遣請求歸併的代表出發了，抗議無效了！有效的抗議，貴乎得時機，貴乎機以切實的行動！</p>

<p>德國流亡美國的大數學家及相當論發明家愛因斯坦博士，業已於六月廿二日在美國地方法院受最後一次的入籍考試以求取得美國公民資格。像其他歸化化公民一樣，也須經過普通關於美國政治的考試，並試騐有無讀寫英文的能力。隨後卽在法官福爾曼的客廳中，用我是「個美國人」為題，在廣播無綫電中發表談話。他的結論說，「如果地球上的情形要適合於人類的理想，世界聯邦乃屬必要。」</p>
<p>這次，和愛因斯坦同時受入籍試騐的，還有他的女兒瑪哥，他的女秘書海倫社加斯，及其他十八人。照章經過九十天，這一批人就正式成爲美國公民了。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦現任普靈斯頓大學數學研究院教授。他帶了他的女兒及秘書，並帶了他的保證人白凱博士及其夫人自普靈斯頓麥賽爾街一百十二號住宅坐着汽車往法院受試。他從汽車中走出來，頭上不戴帽子，口中啣着個烟斗。當他一下車，新聞記者卽蜂擁上前，向他詢問，他成爲美國公民，是否覺得高興？他回答說，「自然，自然。誰不是這樣感想呢？」</p>
<p>試騐歷時二十人分鍾，由費城的入籍及移民局審查員柯切倫主持。據聞愛因斯坦博士的一切答案都極滿意，態度也極鎭靜。他的女兒與秘書經過也極爲良好。惟所問的問題如何，却沒有發表。</p>
<p>考試終了後，愛因斯坦卽接見新聞記者發表談話說，「我認為解決現在人類的問題，空言是無補的。炸彈的轟炸聲已經把人類的聲音窒息了。通常時候，我極相信有思想的人交換意見，但到了今日，暴力加於幾百萬人身上，智識階級向人類理智的呼顯，已不能生效了。」</p>
<p>某記者於是提出問題說，『如果另有一個國際聯盟在這以民族爲單位的世界出現，你對於它有什麼希望呢？』</p>
<p>愛因斯坦的回答，認爲世界聯邦爲人類所必需。以往國聯的失敗，因爲會員國不願放棄牠一部分的主權，而國聯也沒有什麼執行的權力。一個世界的組織，如果不能控制其會員國的全部武力，決不能有效地保證和平。</p>
<p>於是又有人向愛因斯坦發問，他爲什麼願意居住美國而不願欲往他國。他回答說，「七年以前，有人問我爲什麼放棄在德國的地位。我那時會這樣回答，「只要我自由選擇的權利還存在一天，我願意居住在有政治自由，容忍，及一切公民立法律上平等的國家·所謂政治自由是包括言論，出版，及發表政見的自由，所仍謂容忍卽是尊重任何國人的意見</p>
<p>愛因斯坦又說，「從他所見到的美國人來說，美國人無論在氣質上，抑在傳統上，都不適合一種極權制度·也許有人能夠生存於無政治權利及個入自由發展的機會之下，但我認爲這是大多數美國人所不能容忍的。在美國人類的尊嚴，已發達到如此程度，欲人民在個人僅爲國家的奴隸面對於政府無權過問及不能決定其個別生活的方法這種制度下生活，決不是美國人民所能去接受的</p>
<p>這就是愛因斯坦歸入美國的最大理由。(譯紐約Herald　Tribune)</p>

<p>賦予特殊緊急權力</p>
<p>就大體言、今日會議、或將循遮斷歹土防軍合作、及嚴行宵禁之路綫進行、果爾、領事團將准授工部局以特殊緊急權力、而以視昔更廣泛之範圍、實行宵禁之搜查、同時將請駐滬防軍襄助、在公共租界巡邏庶警務人員能從事更重要之工作、此外、並將准許警務處在各馬路架障礙物、截斷通入歹土之途、</p>
<p>根本獲致新的和平</p>
<p>又據某領署官員稱、各國領事今日會議、或可覓得根本解決、而遏止本市層出不窮之違法行爲、然後獲得「新的和平」保障上海安全、則對本市局勢、大有助益、已往九閱月內、領事團曾兩度拒絕工部局之籲請、惟對此次呼籲、不致拒絕之、因兩者完全不同、而工部局之權力、乃領事團所賦予、領事團固直接關切於公共租界治安之維持也、</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以美匯鬆後忽緊、因是人心尚佳、首由銀號進金號二十兩、升爲五千二八十元、比前收抬起十七元、繼賴某錢兑業吸收、再拉五元、錢兑業進銀號十兩、爲五千二百八十五元、奈此後買户減少某銀號見高首肯拋出、因之市勢頓轉、且加不久金號及某小錢荘暗中代客幫吐塞、遂回下十十餘元、銀號出金號十兩、遜爲五千二百六十二元、午刻銀號幫稍有復進、重又好起四元、銀號互做三十兩、爲五千二百六十六元、作午收價、午後開市微落一元、證券幫出銀號十兩、爲五千二百六十五元、旋有某證券幫忽來拖入、接踵銀號亦買、頓被提起十元、銀樓業進銀號等五十兩、爲五千二百七十五元作晚收價、結果此上日回漲十二元、全天僅二十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兑出、依然呆平、大同行仍懸五百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3 id="c90">飛花 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 士琪</p>
<p>飛花者即紗廠中以原棉在紡制棉紗工程內、經過幾度剔除之廢棉也（俗稱下腳花衣）、飛花之種類多至數十種、因在剔除之有先後、遂得分其優劣等級、</p>
<p>（上級飛花）　維拉力等身份、幾與原棉無異、故其價值亦昂、例如本年三月間浦東火機花、漲至最高峯二百三十元、此間上級飛花如抄鋼絲（飛花名目）亦需二百元零、上級飛花用途、約十分之八銷於　小紡績廠、仍紡粗紗、十分之按製棉胎花卷等用、該項上級飛花、約佔紗廠所出全部飛花十分之、</p>
<p>（中級同下級飛花）須經過整理手續後、將一小部分、攙入上級飛花內、其餘大部分都出口推銷國外、該項中下級飛花經過幾度整理剔剩之最下級飛花、稱之曰垃圾、（即棉屑花殼）、此種垃圾、全部銷於遍上豆腐店、以作燃料、尚感求過於供、</p>
<p>各紗廠所出之全部飛花其身份並不　律、視其紡織機器之優劣、成一反比例、如英商怡所出飛花量少而質少、反之如紡織機器老式陳舊才、則所耗原棉折扣浩大、致所出飛花之量多而質美、極合飛花業之銷塲也、</p>
<p>（有時飛花之優劣）與紗廠所採辦之原料有關、最近如某廠採用大批印度低級平果爾（印度棉）、致其所出飛花、亦恶劣不堪、</p>
<p>飛花去路百分之九十推銷國外、尤其歐洲銷路最旺、歐美各國在滬設立之各出口洋行、日常與之往來接觸、比較英商紳士買賣、爽快順利、法國誠懇熱情、德商閃電式钜數交易、尤爲吾華所歡迎、美商則須有質美·價廉·貨速、三項基本原理始可與之談判、否則偶有交貨困難等情、絕無商量餘地、</p>
<p>自歐洲戰事爆發後、飛花業首蒙影響、各級飛花、落千丈、甚之賤售尚難脱貨、美商現雖尚可交易、奈平時亦無钜數交易、致供過於求、市況一厥不振</p>
<p>最近始有少數同業、以某種比例推算、乘低竸購、頭號回絲（飛花名目）囤筗堆棧、故新裕紗廠在本月十八日至十九日二日間、廠盤猛漲四元、由張某購得二百担、價格爲五十元、夏某購得一百担、價格爲五十二元、韓某購得五十担，價格為爲五十四元、後有王某突在申新二廠以扯盤五十九元、購進三百担、按此單都憑投機式目光囤貨、未來之成敗未可知也、</p>
<h3 id="c91">外幣仍乏變動 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤呆定益甚、終稍趨漲、英美金鎊因亦各升五角、英金票供求仍衡、市價站閏、美金票仍在狹小範圍內盤勢、卒告徵漲一分、香港票忽有供給、市價趨　、日金票及朝鮮票需要甚殷、市價一致續漲、前者爲一元二角三分、後者爲一元零七分、</p>
<h3 id="c92">紗花　紗市在醖釀中 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>紗市仍在盤旋之境、但客銷較爲活絡、華南港幫採辦、漸露興旺之象、因此人心振作、至於同業中某大户心思看好、對於二十支雙馬廠單復來收進、所以情況又見鞏固、惟散記都看不好、市面之前途、恐有變化也、不過匯兑及黄金仍屬平平之局、</p>
<p>現紗晨開有一部分搶帽子之户、聞客幫有銷路、一律搶進、價格開高爲九百四十元、少頃某公司又吐出、復鬆至九百三十三元、但某豐號突來吸進、又見回升、中途平平、不過實銷較前爲多、查半日間成交統計二千〇三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、申新廠開出十支童子軍二百包、價爲六百十元、現出、今日有紗二百五十件運福建、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情形、交易稍行　動、但廠方意態依然呆滯如恒、尚未有大量發展氣象、惟同行中偶有成交、然行市無大生色也、太倉花一百五十七元、同行中進一百九十包、平果爾一百四十五六元、同行成交三百件、均係　交</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即呈堅定狀態、投機者稍有購買、後因棉區氣修報告恶劣、及一部分現貨商購買、結果收盤介格、較之上日漲起十餘磅音、昨日印度棉市連同預測漲三羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、終見靜寂異常、各方俱抱觀望態度、除非價格特廉者、日方廠商亦未見有若何動意、諒以月終將届、各方暫擬休止數日也、</p>

<p>（證券暗盤）昨日市況復緩緩趨堅、市上吃户漸多、行甫不易跌落、雖爲利息届期關係、但猶爲皮相之談、和平消息、不絕如縷、故市上多方漸佔勢力、稍一回小即有人吃進、昨日上午交易平平、鴻大及三十八號、稍有買進、聯益昨有賣出、市況堅平、午後吃户漸旺、鴻大繼續搜購、樂茂需要亦殷、震長信孚等均有收入、久孚久豐、鴻康及同裕等雖多少供出不同、市氣仍爲多方優勢、故結果除丁種略小五分外、餘均回好一角半至三角不等、成交總數共計約七十餘元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3 id="c103">生活指數與物價津貼 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>據說生活指數，是在一七三八年名叫杜篤者所發明，考究來源不是我們的研究對象，我們所要懂得的是生活指數的意義，特别是通過它來察看生活問題的嚴重性。</p>
<p>生活指數的作用是挺簡單的，它的本身就是一種統計，即是在一定的時期內。（譬如一個月）把各種物價之增減記下來，再分門别類的（譬如米，麥歸食物類。）來求其平均數，使人家一看便知道前一時期與後一時期物價增減的指數，所以也有叫它作物價指數的。</p>
<p>假使稍為注意注意報紙的話，那末我們在每月上旬可以看到上海公共租界工部局實業組所公佈的前一月的工人生活指數表。為什麼專編制工人生活指數表呢？因為工人是最痛苦的且是數量最多的一羣，一般的講起來，他們是可包括一般的薪水階級們的。</p>
<p>工部局的生活指數表是以民國二十五年（即八一三前一年）為基准的。譬如食物類，民國二十五年為一〇〇·〇〇，但到二十八年三月份便升到一三二，三八，至今年三月份再升到三六五，一五，而六月份便為四五一，七四。這就是說，今年六月份的食物價格恰成民國二十五年的四倍又半。其他方面如房租已達三〇四，八三，衣料三六〇，〇〇，燃料四五二，二〇，雜貨三九四，五五，而其總指數為四二二，九一。這告訴我們，今年六月份為止的物價，相當於二十五年的物價四倍還多。這樣你不妨把一元法幣被除於四二二，九一，便是二三，六五。這就是說，現在一元法幣的購買力，祇值二十五年的二角三分了。</p>
<p>生活指數升得這樣可怕，生活當然要受威脅的，假使從前吃着山珍海味的，那末現在還可換換青菜荳腐，但一向以鹽菜蘿蔔乾拌飯吃的職工們，你難道他們吃半碗嗎？當然辦不到，那末要有解決辦法曪？這就是許多人提出來的「物價津貼」。</p>
<p>為了津貼，有許多人流過血，坐過牢，今天雖有許多商號已經實行了物價津貼，但其數目是少得可憐的，假使有人來做一個統計的話，我相信決不會超過兩倍。</p>
<p>那末在物價漲了四倍還多的現在，薪水階級們的生活嚴重性可以想見了。</p>
<p>但事實昭示我們，照各商號的營業狀況看來，讓物價津貼去緊跟着生活指數是有很大把把的。</p>
<h3 id="c104">押當票 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 李熙</p>
<p>過不了生活，上當店是天經地義的事，可是按月三分（最近實行）的重利，已使一般上當店的朋友感到吃不消了。上海人畢竟是聰明，有些典當在戰後就出現許多「代客贖當」的買賣，他們看准了一般人的取賣能力薄弱，於是出些相當的代價把當票收回來，然後把東西贖出來變賣，因為百物騰貴，所以他們一轉手間，就有很厚的利益。這種非法營業，雖已禁止了，可是最近新興了另一種更殘酷的剥削專業，押當票。</p>
<p>這種買賣，大都流行在貧苦的勞工的集　，從事這種營業的，都是些無業遊民，借了些當地的恶勢力，才做起這種非法的買賣。凡是未過期的當票，都可以押得照票面價值二成的錢，而利息卻要照押款每期三成。他們以五天為一期，而可寬放兩天，即一星期，到期不贖票，作為自願放棄票子所有權，任他們把東西贖來變買。譬如一張當了五元的當票，可以去押一元，而利息就要三角，到期贖票就得付一元三角，没有能力贖，就要付三角的利息，假如這樣一張當票等一個月後去贖，就要付本利二元二角。這是多麼殘酷的買賣！雖然明知要付很毒辣的利息，可是窮人們感到走頭無路的時候，也只好任他們宰割了。</p>
<h3 id="c105">答「關於猜謎」 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 君猷</p>
<p>昨刊三三君「關於猜謎」餘以其指之不當，特為解答如下。</p>
<p>一，「一造絲」之「絆」如猜以「統」亦對。</p>
<p>二，「上有一半，除去一半，還有一半」，三三君忽略了上有一半的「有」字及下有一半的「有」字，其謎底「隨」字，　妙在「有」字，否則，自難索解了，試觀「隨」字，左邊「阝」是將「除」字去掉一半，右上面「」是「有」字的上一半「」下的「工」字，是「空」字的一半，「左」再下的「月」恰是「有」字的下一半，再下的「辶」豈不是「還」字有一半嗎？如細思其味，頗饒興趣。</p>
<p>三，謎底「當票」其實謎面是「二年不回門，另自嫁别人」三三君誤以别則謎面，自然「文不對題」。</p>
<p>四，「哥哥知道的」打縣名一之「昆明」其意頗對，蓋「昆」字係昆仲之昆，即兄弟之兄字解，「昆明」即哥哥明也，三三君意將謎面改為「兄弟爭服兵役」，未悉何意。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3 id="c106">舞後的歸宿 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>關於上夜凶案發作的事，伊蘭真莫名其妙。伊自己承認一睡下去就像死去的一般，連連槍擊都不曾聽得，直到金梅打發老毛出去以後，才到伊房裏去叫醒伊。故而伊對於昨夜的一切經過情形，實在没有什麼有意思的情報。倪金壽在失望之餘，將吴媽打發了出去就把筆册放在衣袋裏，要求和霍桑開始討論這一件疑案的案情。</p>
<p>霍桑在發表他的意見以前，又把長椅上的　藍色絲絨短大衣提起來瞧了一瞧。他在這短大衣裏面的夾袋中，檢出一塊白蔴紗小手帕，一隻銀絲穿的小手袋，袋裏面並無重要東西，祇只幾件化裝品。一隻金質的小粉盒，盒蓋裏面附着鏡子，一小段鉛筆那麼的唇膏，一小根畫眉的墨條，近百元的鈔票大半是十元一張的，一隻小手表和兩枚钥匙。霍桑重新開了那隻鐵箱，跟倪金壽一塊兒檢查它的內容。鐵箱裏果真有一隻小小的首飾盒，內中還有不少珠鑽翡翠寶石的飾物：像金鐲，珠項圈，耳環，戒指等類，估計它們的價值，至少要萬數以上。不過金梅所說的牛奶珠的耳環，卻不在裏面。</p>
<p>霍桑在客室中蹁了一回，緩緩說道：「金壽兄，這件事的確很复雜，而且矛盾和衝突點也不少，眼前還不容易有什麼合理的解秋。」</p>
<p>倪金壽說：「那末，我們姑且做一個假定。據我們所知道的事實看來，那姓餘的嫌疑似乎最重。」</p>
<p>霍桑忽立停子腳步，摇摇手說：「還早，還早。我們決不能就這樣武斷。我們所搜查的事實，還不夠充分，決不能就假定誰的嫌疑最重。我們現在所能討論的，祇能在死者的行動方面推想。」</p>
<p>「好，怎樣推想？」</p>
<p>「第一，這個女子是我們知道的，分明有四個男子同時跟伊發生關系。　（五六）</p>
<h3 id="c107">經濟·清潔，衛生的洗澡法 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 米成</p>
<p>在炎炎夏日，洗澡該是不能省的事吧！</p>
<p>一般人洗澡時，總喜用肥皂，但這實是一件很不合算的辦法，其原因一是不經濟，在目前百物飛漲的時候，一塊浴皂或香皂至少需三四角錢，若用普通的洗衣皂，則鹹性太重，有害皮膚，且無論如何，總得花錢。另一原因是不清潔，　者初聽，似乎奇怪，其實一點也不錯，我們試將兩手塗以肥皂，互相擦扭，等一會兒，將皂沫洗去揩乾，看雙手好像很白淨了，但如我們再用乾毛巾或雙手在手背上用力擦拭時，那末累累的垢泥必會層出不窮，這可以為肥皂不能洗盡垢泥的明證，洗手這樣，洗浴亦然，而且更麻煩，必須擦了又洗，洗了又擦，才得完全潔淨，這樣既費錢又討厭，豈非笨事，現在讓筆者來介紹一種經濟，清潔，而又衛生的洗浴法你的浴水最好用冷水，而且不要先用水把全身弄濕了（即或濕了也要等經漸乾，務使身上祇留此許水分）你得用一二手指蘸水，均匀微薄地塗在身上，祇須它潮面不許它濕，那時你就可用乾燥的手掌在塗水處，用力仔細擦擦，那末許許多多的表面上和毛孔裏積蓄着的垢泥，必會完全被擦出來，一些不留，在你擦好了一處以後，再依同法施行於他處，等全身都擦遍了，那末你身上也必累滿了垢泥，這時，祇要用水把它洗去再以乾巾用力擦乾，使皮膚紅潤，你的浴已經很快地洗畢了。</p>
<p>這樣的洗浴法，有幾種好處：不用肥皂，不用熱水，經濟節約，一也，所有垢泥，一次擦盡清，潔簡便，二也，冷水洗後，擦之使皮膚紅潤，血液流通，有益衛生，三也，可謂有一舉三行，且筆者曾以之介紹於數友，均頗滿意，讀者諸君，盍亦為這？</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>將在大華上映青青之火二片中的主角米蓋羅納，亦即今年常選的電影皇帝，年少英俊，風流倜儻。自他登龍以來，素稱好萊塢標準美男子的克拉蓋博爾，勞勃　勒，泰羅鮑華三人，都有黯然失色之概。</p>
<p>然而美國許多評論都以爲米蓋羅納這副表演的神情，果然獲得一般年輕女郎的歡迎，却不能成爲婦女們的大情人，充其量，不過是一位優秀的演員而已。這在米蓋原也爲引不快，而期望於將來。</p>
<p>但最近更使皇帝煩惱的，就是醫生斷定，十八歲的他，身髖已停止生長了，此後他無論如何漂亮，總是身長不滿正呎的矮子，更難奪取婦女們的寵愛，這個消息，如霹靂一般傅入他的耳鼓。</p>
<p>皇帝的朋友，聽得這個壞消息，大家紛紛去安慰他，有的　喻說：一個滑稽角兒，以保持現狀爲貴，身體長了，非但未必紅起來，且將不適於他現在滑稽歌唱的角色，不如永遠保持「老童星」的色彩爲妙。有的說：米琪進好萊塢時，兩袖清風，現在已有每星期四百美金的薪金，每片一萬美金的紅利，自備住宅汽車，又曾登過皇座，大可以滿足了。然而少爺脾氣的米蓋，總還不能釋然忘懷呢。</p>
<h3 id="c109">閒話武旦 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>武旦戲向不爲人所重視，因之武旦一行，幾有才難之嘆。自閻嵐秋（九陣風）老去，朱桂芳輟演，此行更日漸衰落，幸天不絕武旦之後；　世善宋德珠竟相繼而起，玆二人者，皆聲華朗潤，巴藝雙絕，與嵐秋桂芳相較，正無多讓，而風頭之盛，口碑之佳，日遠在嵐秋桂芳之上，自小閻德珠出，武旦一門，從此不致有中斷之虞矣。</p>
<p>坤伶之習武旦者，佳材益尠，余所見者，惟小金鈴粉菊花喜彩鳳金少寶四人較有可觀，然出手功夫，除粉菊花一人獨擅外，餘均不嫻此術，菊花佳矣，惜以小脚而不習踩　，武旦若無　工，於身段姿態上，終不免减却不少「美」趣，蓋踩　乃爲習武旦者應有條件之一種也。</p>
<p>白叔安之女白玉艷，爲文武全能花旦，武旦戲更見功力，金山寺之出手，純熟矯捷，極五花八門之妙，衝勁如宋德珠，穩練如閻世善，驚險處幾使人爲之橋舌不下，此種絕技，不特近時坤伶中所罕有，即求諸過去南北梨園，亦無人足與之比擬，有人以鳳毛麟角譽玉艷，誠不爲過。玉艷之戲，除葡萄花衫劇均所擅長外，近更致力於「粱紅王」「英節烈」「花木蘭」「鐵鏡公主」及崑劇斷橋」諸齣，矢志向上，孜孜不休，其前程豈有量哉？</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>每到了夏季，照例有露天電影出現。在歐美各國，夏季露天電影塲也很風行，就我們的記憶上，早先各個遊樂塲，都有放映露天電影的部份，不過這種露天電影，每是在屋頂的乎台上，除了夏天別個季節是不會有人去看的。而且在這種塲合，觀衆的教育程度較低聲音很雌亂，所映的又全是隔得很久的奮片，這便是缺點。</p>
<p>近午，到了夏天，有人特地開闢露天電影塲來。跳馬廳，霞飛路，都有設過，去年，靜安寺路的滄洲飯店曾設過滄洲露天電影塲，而今年戈登路大華路上，又有綠野露天電影塲的出現。</p>
<p>在露天電影塲中，使我們特別感到興趣的，就在一陣陣凉風吹來，覺得非常爽快，普通的電影院裏，難有電風扇，冷氣等設備，還沒有草地上吹來凉風的自然，而够使身心感到愉快。</p>
<p>不過露天電影塲祗能在夜晚放映影片，白天是不能營業的。爲了是在曠塲上面。發音沒有電影院的清晰，要是雨天，就不能映影片，也許草地上會有蚊虫來叮你，這便是露天電影塲的缺點呢！</p>

According to sources, Chairman Chiang, in recent meetings of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Seventh Plenary Session, the National Defense Council, the weekly memorial service of the National Government, and in his final declaration after the blockade of the Burma, Yunnan, and Vietnam routes, clearly and emphatically stated that China would not consider peace proposals and would continue the war of resistance, regardless of any developments in the international situation.</p>
<p>Chinese sources also stated that neither Japan nor Britain has currently put forward any peace proposals. The British side has never made any peace proposals through the Chinese Embassy in London or the British Embassy in Chongqing. Since the Sino-Japanese War began three years ago, there have inevitably been so-called "peace proposals" from irresponsible parties from time to time. However, the Chinese government has never taken them seriously and has never discussed them. The only exception was the peace proposal put forward by the former German Ambassador Trautmann before the fall of Nanjing. However, these talks never progressed beyond the preliminary stage and completely broke down before any formal negotiations began. All subsequent proposals have had no actual support, and the Chinese authorities have immediately rejected any such proposals because they believe that the Japanese have no sincerity and are only attempting to sow discord within China. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Reports circulating here that the Chinese government has decided to change its diplomatic policy from supporting democratic nations to a pro-Axis policy have been strongly denied by well-informed sources today. It is understood that the above statement was circulated after the surrender of France and the British blockade of the Burma Road. It is said that at a recent meeting of Chinese authorities, some leaders advocated that China increase its relations with the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy, believing that the world situation had changed and that China must adjust its diplomatic policy. However, the highest authorities firmly maintained that China should continue its previous diplomatic policy, regardless of international developments, maintaining friendly relations with Germany and Italy on the one hand, and hoping that the United States and the Soviet Union would assist China in the war of resistance on the other. Therefore, it is expected that China's diplomatic policy will not change. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Qingdao - According to an official statement issued here yesterday by the American authorities, a group of Japanese thugs and many Chinese people instigated by the Japanese attacked a detachment of American sailors stationed in Qingdao on Saturday night of the previous week. When the attack took place, the police of the Japanese Consulate, who were present, did not intervene, and the crowd, incited by the Japanese, became even more aggressive. Young Japanese students tore up the uniform worn by a member of the American naval patrol and slapped him in the face, and several other Americans were also injured, although not seriously. According to the statement, the riot was caused by two American sailors and a junior officer of a Japanese merchant ship trying to leave an American-owned café without paying their bill. At that time, both the American sailors and the Japanese officer had drunk heavily and apparently disregarded who should pay for the drinks, and a dispute arose. The Japanese junior officer kicked one of the American sailors, and many other Japanese people then attacked the two American sailors. Later, when the Japanese consular police and the American naval patrol arrived, a crowd including Japanese and Chinese people joined the attack. The American patrol tried to stop them, but they were also beaten by the crowd, who were incited by the Japanese junior officer who started the incident. The consular police did not arrest the Japanese junior officer who started the incident. The statement went on to say that in the confusion, the Japanese consular police and the American patrol apparently had a dispute, but the exact details are not yet known. The statement commented on the crowd attacking the Americans, saying that the most violent attackers were clearly Japanese. Negotiations to resolve this incident are currently underway.

<p>Chongqing - A special mission sent by the government to various provinces for investigation has recently returned to Chongqing and submitted a highly optimistic report to the government authorities. It is said that all southwestern provinces, including Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, which are generally known for poor harvests, have reported good harvests this year. The living conditions of farmers, workers, and merchants have all improved, as the prices of agricultural products have increased, wages have risen, and merchants have made more profits. In the past, villages in the interior slaughtered a pig about every ten days for food. When they slaughtered a pig, the villagers would beat gongs around the village, which was considered a major event. Now, they no longer beat gongs because they slaughter pigs every day. The only ones affected by the war are teachers and civil servants who live on fixed salaries. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">New Changes in Europe <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Is this a reckoning of old historical debts? Or is it sowing the seeds of future troubles? In recent days, significant new changes have occurred internationally, in addition to the wars between China and Japan and between Britain and Germany. Although they all have their origins, in normal times, they could only be resolved by war. Now, however, they are progressing without bloodshed. For example, in the Balkans, Romania ceded territory to the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria and Hungary have also raised border issues with Romania. After the First World War, Romania obtained Bessarabia from the Soviet Union, Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria, and Transylvania and Bukovina from Hungary. These are the territories that are now becoming problematic. Also, in the Baltic Sea region, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have all established Soviet governments and have requested annexation by the Soviet Union. They originally belonged to the Russian Empire and became independent as democratic republics after the collapse of Tsarist Russia during the First World War, less than twenty years ago. As a result of these new changes, Romania has suddenly shrunk in size and has fallen into extreme poverty and weakness. Having turned against Britain and embraced Germany, it can hardly control its national destiny. The unity within the Balkan Peninsula has disappeared, and the external balance of power has been broken. As for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, under the procedure of their parliaments' self-determination and their delegations' petition to Moscow, they are no longer independent countries. As a result, the situation of numerous small countries in Europe after the First World War has changed. The Soviet Union has increased its "territory by more than 600,000 square miles, its population by more than six million, and its ice-free coastline by 750 miles" (according to Reuters). The various objective conditions for the European powers to compete for hegemony have changed accordingly.</p>
<p>The world's reaction to the above-mentioned new changes is indeed divided, with varying opinions. Italy expressed its indifference because "the Baltic Sea coastal countries are not part of Italy's direct sphere of interest." Germany, which now has a very long border with the Soviet Union, has more than one stake in the matter. However, because it is at war with Britain, it is turning a blind eye to the Soviet Union's actions and is turning a deaf ear to the three countries' surrender to the Soviet Union. Britain, which is at war with Germany, is likely to remain silent for the time being, as it still has a glimmer of hope for the Soviet Union. However, the United States, through Acting Secretary of State Welles, issued a statement of condemnation, saying that Americans oppose acts of plunder and oppose any powerful nation interfering in the internal affairs of any small, independent country. The above principles are the basis of relations between the twenty-one independent republics of the Americas. The American people firmly believe that unless these principles can be continued to be observed, there will be no reasonable fairness and rule of law. In other words, unless these principles can be continued to be observed, the foundations of modern civilization cannot be preserved. His words were full of a sense of justice and are the keynote of American international policy. Because Secretary of State Hull represented the United States at the Pan-American Conference, seeking close cooperation among the American countries, Welles's statement, on the one hand, had a protest nature against the new changes in Europe, and on the other hand, offered solace to the small, weak allies in the Americas under its wing, promoting Hull's great mission.</p>
<p>The problem of Romania's borders may be said to be the natural result of the victors' failure to thoroughly implement the principle of national self-determination at the end of the First World War.</p>
<p>The issue of the three Baltic Sea coastal countries is extremely complex. The most important point is that the problem did not begin now, that is, not in the past few weeks with the re-election of the parliaments and the reorganization of the governments of the three countries, but last year with the conclusion of agreements between the Soviet Union and the three countries, and the entry of the Red Army. An independent country has absolutely no reason to allow a powerful neighbor to station troops within its borders. After reluctantly allowing this, the accumulated power and influence not only impairs the completeness of sovereignty and constrains administrative actions, but also makes its people unable to maintain their self-confidence and self-respect. Inevitably, this will affect politics and make it impossible to maintain their autonomy. Was not the initial compromise of the three countries intended to seek a complete solution? Finally, the parliaments were re-elected, the governments were reorganized, and the national flags were changed. The fact that the three countries are no longer independent is neither sudden nor accidental. Finland, on the other side of the sea, still stands firm, which can serve as a counter-example. Second, the general changes in Europe have caused people without firm principles to lose their resolve. As the facts show, might is right, and small countries are in imminent danger. Therefore, they have psychologically adapted to the principle of "those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black," and have created a situation in which "they drive fish into the deep, and they drive birds into the thickets." The three countries, caught between the Soviet Union and Germany, were truly forced to choose. Therefore, the plight of the general public in the three countries deserves sympathy. However, the reasonable, fair, and legal rule that the United States respects, the foundation of modern civilization that it respects, the plunder that it opposes, and the interference by any powerful nation in the internal affairs of any small, independent country are mere high-sounding words, of what benefit are they to the changes in the world? By the time the parliaments have been re-elected, the governments have been reorganized, and the representatives who automatically volunteered to request annexation have set off, the protests are ineffective! Effective protests depend on timing and on timely and practical action!</p>

The mainland Chinese authorities have already banned the export of livestock such as cattle and pigs, which is also a major reason for the rising prices due to insufficient supply. As for fresh fish, the daily consumption in Hong Kong is about 250 dan, and its price has risen again and again, doubling compared to last year and tripling compared to before the war.

<p>Sofia: Bulgarian King Boris yesterday received Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov separately to discuss their upcoming visit to Germany. It is reported that the meeting between the Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will be held in Salzburg. The Bulgarian cabinet members will only stay in Germany for one day and will return to the capital on the 29th of this month. Political figures believe that this meeting is the first step in resolving Bulgarian-Romanian relations. People here are very pleased with the Romanian government's willingness to negotiate this matter and are grateful for Germany's support of Bulgaria's demands. (Telegraph from Haitong on the 25th)</p>
<p>New York: The dangerous situation that may occur in the Balkans has recently thwarted Hitler's planned attack on Britain. The meeting between Hitler and the leaders of Romania and Bulgaria in Salzburg at the end of this week indicates that the situation in the Balkans, even if Hitler's plan cannot be determined, the next thing after Hitler summoned the Romanian and Bulgarian leaders was the incorporation of the three Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia into the Soviet Union. It is reported that Hitler is now paying close attention to the issue of Romania establishing a communist government. Both Romania and Bulgaria are opposed to the Soviet Union's expansion of power in the Balkans, but these two countries are only united on this issue. Apart from this, Bulgaria still wants to recover Dobruja, while Romania resorts to war and is unwilling to return the land to Bulgaria. The Salzburg meeting clearly involves the issue of Dobruja, as Hitler wants to use this to extinguish the flames of the Balkans and achieve his plan to attack Britain.

<p>Rome: It has been confirmed here that Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manolescu, after conferring with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg, will come to Rome to meet with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and pay respects to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Telegraph from Haitong on the 25th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: People here are very satisfied with the visit of Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manolescu to Berlin accompanied by the German Minister. Local evening newspapers claim that these two politicians will further enhance the friendship between Germany and Romania, and that all countries in the Balkans and the Danube River basin will live in peace and resolve various outstanding issues in a spirit of friendship. The current priority is economic cooperation among the countries, as Central Europe has become the main market. It is hoped that the delegation will do its best to protect Romania's interests, and Romania's joining the German-Italian axis is also a necessary move. (Telegraph from Rome on the 25th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Government circles said last night that the main topic discussed at the Salzburg meeting was the redefinition of the Romanian and Hungarian borders, based on the mutual migration of populations. General discussions will also be held on the situation in Southeast Europe, especially regarding the friendly exchange of goods between the two countries. (Telegraph from United Press on the 25th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian officials stated that the Axis powers will proceed with the Salzburg meeting in a spirit of close cooperation. Italy has adopted a silent attitude towards the Salzburg meeting plan, only stating that its purpose is to eliminate Britain's plans in the Balkans. It is heard that Britain has recently attempted to establish a new order in the Balkans, which has a tendency to be hostile to the Axis powers, and now the Axis powers have decided to take countermeasures to guarantee peace in the Balkans.

<p>The Romanian Government Plans to Concede to Bulgaria</p>
<p>Berlin: Political figures here are very interested in the negotiations that the authorities are about to hold with Balkan politicians. According to official announcements, in addition to representatives from Bulgaria and Romania, key figures from Slovakia will also visit Berlin within this week. According to well-informed political figures here, various issues in Southeast Europe, which are more important than all border issues, have been unresolved for 20 years. Therefore, the situation is becoming increasingly tense, and even preliminary talks are impossible to start. However, Britain and France are profiting from this, so excluding the influence of Britain and France in the Balkans and mediation by Germany is the basis for resolving this issue. The hopes of Hungary and Bulgaria are already known here. According to Bulgarian sources, Romania is prepared to make concessions to Bulgaria. Since Germany's intervention in the Balkans, Eastern Europe has expressed friendship towards Germany, and Germany is very willing to see the Balkans restore order and tranquility through peaceful means. Political figures believe that continued discussions on this issue will be able to resolve all outstanding matters quickly. According to sources in Rome, preliminary talks on the Balkan issue were already discussed during Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Germany, indicating that Germany and Italy are in complete agreement on the Balkan issue. (Telegraph from Haitong on the 25th)</p>
<p>Hungarian-Romanian Negotiations to Commence Soon</p>
<p>Budapest: According to semi-official news agency sources here, Romanian political figures said that Romania will negotiate with Hungary on territorial issues within the next few days. Romania hopes to live in peace with its western neighbor and is very willing to cede part of Outer Transylvania in order to resolve the Hungarian-Romanian dispute and sign a Hungarian-Romanian treaty.

<p>Romanian Authorities Requisition Oil Tankers</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian National Railway Administration has requisitioned all oil tankers for government use. These vehicles were originally private property. Once requisitioned, they cannot be sold to foreign countries. The government has also decided to impose an export tax of 10% on oil tankers exported abroad today, with the exception of those exported to Germany. (Telegraph from Haitong News Agency on the 25th)</p>
<p>British-Dutch Oil Company Interfered With</p>
<p>London: The largest oil company operating in Romania, a joint British-Dutch venture, has been interfered with. The Romanian Petroleum Committee recently pointed out that the company had not reported work details as requested by the committee, so it sent an administrator to supervise the company's affairs. In its announcement of this matter, the committee cited a recent German white paper stating that, according to documents seized from a train used by the French General Staff, Britain and France had tacitly approved the complete destruction of the Romanian oil industry. This white paper contains secret reports allegedly issued by the French mission in Bucharest, and an alleged telegram issued by former French Ambassador Thierry advocating the blockade of the Danube River to prevent German waterway traffic. French sources in London believe that the statements in these documents are not to be trusted, as Romania and the Allied authorities were working closely at the time. It is surprising that Bucharest allowed its publication, as not only is Thierry still the head of the French mission, but the document also involves current Romanian personnel. British officials do not intend to comment on this attempt to incite anti-British sentiment. At the same time, Germany is using various pretexts to promote Romanian actions against foreign rights. (Telegraph from Reuters on the 25th)</p>
<p>Romania Recalls its Minister to Britain</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian government has already recalled its minister to Britain, Tyrrell. According to well-informed sources, Tyrrell's recall is of great significance, as he is a member of the "Titulescu faction." When Titulescu was Romania's foreign minister, he supported British and French interests in the Balkan Peninsula and adopted an anti-German attitude. In the spring of 1939, when German troops entered Prague, Tyrrell told reporters that Germany had issued an ultimatum to Romania regarding economic issues, causing the international situation to become tense. Tyrrell himself admitted that it was a lie, intended only to make Southeast Europe adopt an anti-German attitude. (Telegraph from Bucharest on the 25th)</p>
<p>London: It is rumored that Britain and Romania have severed diplomatic relations. While officials from both countries have not confirmed this, they believe it is not impossible, and that if the two countries do sever relations, it would be due to pressure from the German government.

<p>London: The British Air Force shot down 12 German aircraft over Britain yesterday, and last night it flew over Germany and German-occupied areas to launch attacks, claiming great success. Targets bombed in the Netherlands and Germany included the Gotha-Kassel and Weser Flugzeugbau aircraft factories, oil depots in Hamburg and Gelsenkirchen, railway transportation hubs, anti-aircraft gun teams, searchlights, and 12 airfields. A German fighter attempted to intercept British bombers and was shot down. One British aircraft was also shot down during the attack. In addition, British aircraft from the Coastal Command, in addition to routine patrols, flew to the port of Dunkirk to bomb oil tanks and shot down a German seaplane off the northeast coast of Scotland. However, oil tanks in Førde and shipyards in Amsterdam were bombed. Yesterday, German aircraft attacked Britain and dropped bombs on a town in southeastern England, causing damage and some casualties. Some bombs also hit an area in southwestern Scotland, but the damage was minor and there were no serious injuries. Yesterday, a large-scale air battle involving 60 British and German aircraft took place over the southeast coast of England. According to witnesses, a German fighter was shot down and crashed to the ground, and the pilot parachuted out. The battle was thrilling. The debris of a German fighter that crashed into a street was riddled with bullets, demonstrating the intensity of the British fighter squadron's gunfire. In addition, a communique from the Air Ministry's information department described the British aircraft's attack, stating that British aircraft flew to Weser Flugzeugbau and dropped high-explosive bombs on the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory. Four large bombs hit the main factory building, causing fires and explosions. The explosive force was so strong that it was felt by British airmen thousands of feet in the air. After the Gotha aircraft factory was hit, explosions occurred in many places. British aircraft also launched a lightning-fast attack on the Wilhelmshaven naval shipyard, bombing targets for 10 minutes, during which several explosions were seen. (Telegraph from Reuters on the 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that a German speedboat south of Portland fired a torpedo and sank an enemy merchant ship (8,000 tons). German aircraft attacked British ships in the English Channel and industrial facilities in southeastern Scotland and England. Five enemy escort merchant ships were sunk (totaling 17,000 tons), and three other ships were hit by bombs and suffered heavy damage. German aircraft also bombed the Vickers aircraft factory near Weybridge, destroying four aircraft. Industrial facilities in Great Yarmouth and Glasgow were destroyed. During the German aircraft's attack on an enemy convoy, fierce fighting broke out with British aircraft, and six British aircraft were shot down. Last night, British aircraft flew over northern Germany and dropped bombs, but there were no losses. In total, 10 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, six of which were shot down in air combat, and the rest were destroyed on the ground. Six German aircraft are missing. (Telegraph from Haitong on the 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German military expert released a military report yesterday stating that a German aircraft once again sank a British submarine. The German aircraft, while patrolling the North Sea, spotted a submarine off Aberdeen. Before the enemy ship could submerge, our aircraft flew down to 80 meters and dropped three bombs. One of them hit a few feet from the pilot house. A few minutes later, the front of the submarine rose up, and after another three or four minutes, it sank into the water. The aircraft continued to search for survivors in the vicinity, but only saw debris from lifeboats and oil slicks. Although the weather was bad, the air force still destroyed several important transportation lines and supply depots in southern England. Two outpost ships and one minesweeper were destroyed on the English south coast. German submarine teams also reported sinking two armed enemy merchant ships totaling 14,000 tons. These merchant ships were escorted by warships, demonstrating the effectiveness of German submarine attacks. (Telegraph from Haitong on the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Pan-American Conference Considers a Military Pact for the Entire Americas, Restricting the Activities of Representatives of Belligerent Nations, and Guaranteeing the "Security Zone" of the West <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Havana: The Pan-American Conference last night considered a new plan to transform the previous Panama Declaration into a formal military agreement to safeguard the "security zone" of the Americas and prevent the European war from spreading to the Western Hemisphere. The Panama Declaration was signed by the twenty-one American republics in Panama City in December 1938. The proposal to convert the declaration into a formal agreement was submitted yesterday to the Neutrality Committee, chaired by Coste Jigen, representing President Anderson. Simultaneously, the Peace Assurance Committee, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, adjourned after hearing the reading of two articles establishing a trusteeship system for Dutch and French colonies in the Western Hemisphere. After the adjournment, Hull stated that no decision had yet been made to take practical action, as the meeting was purely to listen to the proposals. Practical action may be decided upon at today's meeting. Hull said that the spirit among the delegates during yesterday's discussion was extremely harmonious. The United States yesterday presented a method to the conference to crack down on illegal activities in the Western Hemisphere. The proposal was to adopt stricter restrictions on diplomatic representatives sent by belligerent countries, conduct detailed verification when presenting credentials, and then pay closer attention to their various activities. The plan also proposed that the American republics constantly exchange information on the activities of their diplomatic representatives.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Permanent Neutrality Committee in Argentina</p>
<p>The Neutrality Committee yesterday passed a resolution to establish a permanent Neutrality Committee in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Although the twenty-one republics strongly uphold the principles of peace, recent developments have made them feel that there may be unforeseen circumstances in the future. A small number of Latin American countries, which previously criticized the actions of the U.S. Navy as "imperialism" and "the threat of the Northern Colossus," now openly declare that the current situation is different from the past. Given its vast territory, superior economic and military strength, and geographical advantages, the United States should naturally be the leader of the American countries in the event of an incident. According to what this reporter understands, President Roosevelt's self-defense message has been fully endorsed by Latin America. So far, no one has opposed the U.S. rearmament plan. At the same time, diplomatic circles believe that military cooperation among the American countries is not far off, and may even be implemented during the conference. The majority of Pan-American countries have army and air force personnel concentrated in Washington, and in Latin America, the United States has eight military representatives stationed in seventeen countries. At the same time, the United States has seven army specialists stationed in Latin America. These specialists are hired by the countries in which they are stationed and serve as advisors and guides. Although there are currently no "Flying Fortresses" traveling between the United States and Buenos Aires, military aircraft frequently carry members of the U.S. Congressional Committee and high-ranking army officers to various countries.

<p>Venezuela Advocates Mutual Assistance Among American Countries</p>
<p>Havana: Venezuela recently proposed a plan advocating that American countries mutually guarantee to provide assistance to each other in the event of aggression. This plan has greatly surprised some representatives who only wish to isolate the Americas from totalitarianism. This plan is sufficient to supplement the inadequacies of the defensive agreements concluded by the United States with the Caribbean countries. Today's conference will discuss sixteen draft resolutions regarding the issue of European territories in the Western Hemisphere, neutrality issues, economic cooperation issues, and other issues. As a result of Venezuela's proposal for mutual assistance among countries to defend against aggression, the conference may conduct a general discussion on the issue of Western Hemisphere defense, regardless of the rules of procedure. In addition, proposals from several other representatives will also be submitted once the situation becomes clearer regarding the issue of European territories. Because the views of the United States and Argentina have not converged, the matter has not been resolved, but the representatives at the meeting are making efforts to find a compromise. Argentina has decided to draft a declaration expressing opposition to any transfer of territory and is willing to engage in discussions, but does not agree with the joint trusteeship system.

What Japan is doing to China today is what the coalition of nations could impose on us in the future. I may sound selfish in saying this, but from the standpoint of our own interests, would it not be better to encourage the development of China's economic security? I certainly know Japan's needs, and I also advocate peaceful trade with Japan, but from my point of view, the spread of war in the world must be stopped, and the best way to stop the spread of war in the Far East is to create economic security."

<p>(Governor-General of Vietnam Discusses Embargo Issue with Japanese Side)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The Governor-General of French Vietnam, Lieutenant General Decoux, held his first meeting with Major General Nishihara, the head of the Japanese inspection team, yesterday. Decoux's task is difficult: on the one hand, he must comply with the Japanese demands, and on the other hand, he must protect French autonomy. The French authorities attach great importance to the outcome of the current Vietnamese commercial inspection team in the United States. The task of the commercial inspection team is to promote commercial and financial relations between Vietnam and the United States. Major General Nishihara has completed his inspection of the Vietnamese border. The Vietnamese authorities have suspended the transport of all kinds of goods to China before deciding which goods should be allowed to be imported into China. Even the goods used by the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing have been temporarily detained. It is reported that U.S. freight vehicles worth approximately US$6 million, which were originally intended to be transported to China, have also been detained in Haiphong. The French authorities here stated yesterday that they have largely complied with the Japanese demands. Therefore, the French authorities will reject other possible Japanese demands, such as expelling the Chongqing representatives stationed in Hanoi and allowing Japanese troops to pass through Haiphong to Yunnan.

<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox declared today that the government is currently considering transferring inland technical workers to coastal cities so that they can be sent to work in shipyards. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: Responsible parties recently stated that the U.S. Army and Navy authorities may immediately begin a comprehensive study of the issue of U.S. Army and Navy garrisons in the Philippines in order to make appropriate arrangements. According to the terms of the Philippine Independence Act, the property of the U.S. Army will be transferred to the Philippine government, while the naval garrisons will be subject to U.S.-Philippine negotiations. According to the special terms of the Philippine Independence Act, the U.S. President's negotiation of the disposal of naval garrisons cannot be delayed for more than two years after the Philippines declares independence. Before a final resolution is reached, the garrisons will remain under U.S. rule. Officials here believe that these garrisons, which should be resolved through negotiations, include Olongapo, Cavite, and the powerful fortress of Corregidor defending Manila Bay. Whether it is advantageous for the United States to maintain naval bases in the Philippines is a matter on which the U.S. Army and Navy circles have very different opinions. Well-informed sources said that the U.S. Navy has two options on this issue: one is to draft an alternative disposal plan, or to leave it to the naval leaders of 1946 to reconsider. It is also said that the resolution of the naval base issue depends entirely on whether the United States decides to remain a major power in the Far East and whether it withdraws from the Far East. Next year, the U.S. Congress may make a decision on the defense of Guam and its foreign policy in the Far East, which will have a strong impact on the naval base issue. Although the issue of naval garrisons in the Philippines is a point of contention between the U.S. and the Philippines, given the current situation, Filipinos are probably very willing to have U.S. troops stationed permanently in these garrisons.

An official explained that the reason why the committee took this action was that it was considered too dangerous to allow American ships to approach an area so close to the actions of belligerent nations. The official said that the committee's adoption of this policy was not authorized by the White House or the State Department. Foreign oil tankers are not affected. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>London: The Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, delivered a broadcast speech tonight, stating that a plan for American manufacturers to build 3,000 aircraft per month for our country has been approved by U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.

Since the establishment of this Ministry, it has successively purchased 12,115 aircraft engines from the United States to match the airframes manufactured in our country. "The large number of engines arriving from the United States is enough to encourage workers in the national aircraft manufacturing industry and strengthen our country's resistance." Others say that our country's efforts to build a navy, in order to be worthy of a strong spirit at sea, have been proven by the facts. This is because our country is primarily manufacturing aircraft, also coming out with the same spirit. It can be asserted that it will definitely be successful. Furthermore, the aircraft manufactured by our country's factories are of excellent quality, because their speed, precision of armaments, and ferocity of offensive power are unsurpassed.

<h3 id="e55">Einstein Takes American Citizenship <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Einstein, the great mathematician and inventor of the theory of relativity who fled Germany to the United States, underwent his final naturalization examination at the U.S. District Court on June 22 to obtain American citizenship. Like other naturalized citizens, he had to pass a general examination on American politics and demonstrate his ability to read and write English. Afterward, he delivered a speech titled "I am an American" on the radio in Judge Forman's living room. He concluded, "If the situation on Earth is to be suitable for human ideals, a world federation is necessary."</p>
<p>This time, Einstein's daughter, Margot, his female secretary, Helen Dukas, and eighteen others took the naturalization examination with him. According to regulations, after ninety days, this group will officially become American citizens.</p>
<p>Einstein is currently a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. He took his daughter and secretary, as well as his guarantor, Dr. Beca and his wife, from his residence at 112 Mercer Street in Princeton to the court for the examination by car. He got out of the car without a hat, with a pipe in his mouth. As soon as he got out of the car, reporters flocked to him, asking if he was happy to become an American citizen. He replied, "Of course, of course. Who wouldn't feel that way?"</p>
<p>The examination lasted twenty minutes and was presided over by Cochrane, an examiner from the Naturalization and Immigration Bureau of Philadelphia. It is said that Dr. Einstein's answers were all extremely satisfactory, and his attitude was very calm. His daughter and secretary also did very well. However, the questions asked were not disclosed.</p>
<p>After the examination, Einstein met with reporters and said, "I don't think empty talk can solve the current problems of mankind. The sound of bombs has stifled the voices of mankind. Usually, I strongly believe in the exchange of opinions among intellectuals, but today, with violence inflicted on millions of people, the intellectual class's appeal to human reason is no longer effective."</p>
<p>A reporter then asked, "If another international alliance appears in this world based on nations, what hope do you have for it?"</p>
<p>Einstein replied that a world federation is necessary for mankind. The failure of the previous League of Nations was because member states were unwilling to give up part of their sovereignty, and the League of Nations had no enforcement power. A world organization that cannot control all the military power of its member states cannot effectively guarantee peace.</p>
<p>Then someone asked Einstein why he was willing to live in the United States and not go to other countries. He replied, "Seven years ago, someone asked me why I gave up my position in Germany. I would have answered then, "As long as my right to choose freely exists, I am willing to live in a country with political freedom, tolerance, and legal equality for all citizens." So-called political freedom includes freedom of speech, publication, and expression of political views. Tolerance means respecting the opinions of any national.</p>
<p>Einstein also said, "From what he has seen of Americans, Americans are not suited to a totalitarian system, either in temperament or tradition. Perhaps some people can survive without political rights and the opportunity for individual freedom of development, but I don't think this is tolerable for most Americans. In America, human dignity has developed to such an extent that it is impossible for the American people to accept a system in which individuals are merely slaves of the state and have no right to question the government or determine their individual lives.</p>
<p>This is Einstein's biggest reason for becoming an American citizen. (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Consular Body Held Special Meeting Yesterday, Advocating Assistance to the Municipal Council; Issues Discussed Decided to be Temporarily Withheld; Second Meeting Scheduled for Next Thursday <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Considering the recent prevalence of political assassinations in the concession, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Caisiewei, appealed to the Consular Body to cooperate with the concession authorities to jointly curb them. The Consular Body originally planned to hold the meeting on Tuesday, but due to the Japanese Consul General, Miura, claiming that the notification time was too short to attend, it was postponed to yesterday. The meeting was held under the strict protection of the detective force of the Police Department of the Municipal Council, discussing ways to curb terrorist activities in Shanghai for three hours. The opening time was 3:30 p.m., and the last to arrive was the Japanese Consul General, Miura Yoshiaki. However, no resolution was passed as a result of the discussion. The only comment made by the leading consul, Bull, to reporters was, "We certainly advocate assisting the Municipal Council; we advocate assisting every law-abiding person." The remaining seventeen consuls general left the Municipal Council Chamber after the meeting. Mr. Xi stated that the proposal to add a layer of barriers between the Public Concession and the Badlands area of West Shanghai was not raised during the meeting. The secretary of the Consular Body, Lange, stated that the various issues discussed at this meeting have now been decided to be temporarily withheld from public release, pending the actual adoption of a resolution next Thursday, after which it will be released.</p>
<p>This Appeal Should Be Accepted</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Chairman of the Municipal Council recently appealed to the Consular Body to curb political terrorist activities in Shanghai. The Consular Body then scheduled a meeting for 3:30 p.m. today (the 25th) at the Municipal Council Chamber. It was noted that in the past nine months, the Municipal Council has twice appealed to the Consular Body to mediate the important issues of road construction beyond the boundary of the city and the transfer of files from the Chinese Land Bureau, both of which were rejected. This morning, a reporter asked an official of the Consular Body about this matter, and was told that he believed that the Consular Body would not reject the Municipal Council's appeal this time.</p>
<p>The Longest Meeting in History</p>
<p>Today, consuls from thirteen countries with consular jurisdiction in China attended a special meeting, chaired by Hill, the Danish Consul General and leading consul (temporarily replacing the Italian Consul General, Nirong, during his absence). The meeting time was probably the longest in the history of meetings of the Shanghai Consular Body, and a special discussion will be held on the political situation in the city.</p>
<p>Demanding the Elimination of Terrorists</p>
<p>It is expected that the Japanese Consul General, Miura, will propose the elimination of the so-called "Chongqing elements" in the city, while others will make strong demands to eliminate the so-called Nanjing terrorists, such as closing down places generally regarded as nests of political terrorists.</p>
<p>Granting Special Emergency Powers</p>
<p>In general, today's meeting will proceed along the lines of cooperation in blocking the Badlands and defending the military, and strict enforcement of curfew. If so, the Consular Body will grant the Municipal Council special emergency powers and implement curfew searches on a more extensive scale than in the past. At the same time, the Shanghai Defense Force will be asked to assist in patrolling the Public Concession so that police officers can engage in more important work. In addition, the Police Department will be allowed to erect barriers on various roads to cut off access to the Badlands.</p>
<p>Fundamentally Achieving New Peace</p>
<p>According to an official of a certain consulate, today's meeting of consuls from various countries may find a fundamental solution and curb the endless illegal acts in the city, and then obtain a "new peace" to ensure the safety of Shanghai, which will greatly benefit the situation in the city. In the past nine months, the Consular Body has twice rejected the Municipal Council's appeal, but it will not reject this appeal because the two are completely different, and the powers of the Municipal Council are granted by the Consular Body. The Consular Body is directly concerned with the maintenance of public order in the Public Concession.</p>

<p>Father Jacquinot, who presides over the refugee area in Nanshi, Shanghai, resolutely left Shanghai and returned to France via Hong Kong to engage in refugee relief work due to the European war and the major battles suffered by France. When he arrived in Hong Kong, he suddenly stopped temporarily because of the German-French peace talks. Father Jacquinot is still stranded in Hong Kong, but he is deeply concerned about the refugees in Shanghai. According to news from Hong Kong, Father Jacquinot will soon buy a boat and return to Shanghai to serve. If Father Jacquinot can still return to preside over the work of the refugees, the general refugees will celebrate with their hands on their foreheads. Father Jacquinot has served in China for twenty years. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, he engaged in refugee relief work, running around to rescue and always thinking of the refugees. He left Shanghai at the beginning of this month after the outbreak of the German-French war.</p>

<p>Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, told Western reporters yesterday that the issue of the Chinese courts in the two concessions of Shanghai had not been resolved despite repeated consultations last month. However, this issue is currently being discussed by the Japanese authorities, the British and French concession authorities, the Consular Body, and the puppet "Municipal Government." The spokesman said that in any case, the Japanese side is "determined" to control the courts in the First and Second Special Districts and will only be satisfied after obtaining them from the Chongqing National Government. He said that this issue will not be delayed indefinitely, and that although negotiations on the issue have not been resolved, they have not stopped either. However, when it will be resolved depends on the attitude of the municipal authorities and the Consular Body of the two concessions. The Chinese side has paid close attention to this news.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese postal inspectors, who previously only worked at the Shanghai Postal Headquarters on North Szechuan Road, may soon be inspecting mail at the French Concession post office as well. Yesterday (the 24th), a responsible party claimed that if the current negotiations are completed, it would not be surprising for the inspectors to enter the French Concession and start working at the beginning of next month. Responsible sources acknowledged that negotiations with relevant parties have been going on for more than a day, but declined to disclose whether complete understanding has been obtained. It is said that whether the Japanese postal inspectors will enter the French Concession to work from next month, or even earlier, depends on the negotiations. There are many post offices in the French Concession, and the Japanese side pays special attention to some of the more important ones. As for which post offices the Japanese will enter to inspect, although it has not been disclosed, reliable sources say that two Japanese went to the Route Massenet Post Office on Thursday to inquire about the convenience of inspection there. The two Japanese stayed inside for a while, and the local officials told them that they had not received an order from the headquarters regarding the inspection of mail in the French Concession. The two Japanese left the office without inspection. It is learned that the Postal Headquarters has indeed not issued such an order to the French Concession post office, but the matter has been discussed. Responsible sources also said that it is inevitable that the Japanese inspectors will interfere in the French Concession. Since the telegraphic communication of the city has already been in the hands of the Japanese, if the Japanese insist on inspecting mail in the French Concession, the French authorities will not be able to stop them. However, it is definitely known that the Japanese have not yet demanded to implement inspections in the post offices of the Public Concession.</p>

<p>All Parties Agreed to Start Mediation; All Employees Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The strike of workers at the New and Old plants of the British-owned Water and Electricity Company has lasted for a week, and the strike has been deadlocked. Yesterday, the workers sent representatives to the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Qiaqing to appeal for assistance. Now Mr. Yu and the Ratepayers Association have accepted the workers' request and agreed to start mediation.</p>
<p>Reasons for Resuming Work</p>
<p>All employees have been receiving requests from workers to participate in strike actions for several days since the 20th. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Jia Duli, the chairman of the company, ordered all employees to leave the company immediately and not to stay inside. However, the employees claimed that this strike was in sympathy with the workers' actions and that they had no demands from the authorities. As of yesterday, there was one Chinese employee in the company who was still working. Therefore, all employees resumed work in the afternoon. The workers thought it was backstabbing and a misunderstanding occurred. The employees have asked the workers for understanding. Whether all employees will work this morning is being discussed.</p>
<p>Supply Not Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company authorities locked the doors of the factory office, prohibiting workers from entering or leaving. Most of the workers then gathered on the open space outside the office, guarding the company gate, and the order was very good. However, in recent days, the gas pressure of the gas storage pool in the old plant has decreased, which has affected users far away. For example, in the Xujiahui area, the required gas supply was suddenly interrupted at noon and in the evening due to insufficient pressure. In addition, the gas supply to users on the upper floors of three- or four-story high-rise buildings was also frequently cut off, which was quite inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Right to Issue Legal Tender Belongs to the Four Banks; The National Government Only Exercises Supervisory Power; The Amount of Issuance Is Below the Saturation Point <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association received the order from the Ministry to announce the amount of legal tender issued by the four banks, China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, and the reserve, a reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that the issuance of legal tender has always adopted a prudent policy. Before the War of Resistance, the amount of legal tender issued in China was too small. Not only were the people in remote areas struggling to find enough silver dollars, but there was also a sense of currency deflation in the cities of the hinterland. After the outbreak of the war, the War of Resistance and national construction progressed simultaneously, and the need for currency became even more urgent. The amount of issuance has increased accordingly, but whether the amount of issuance has exceeded the limit does not depend on the amount, but entirely on whether it is suitable for the needs of society and whether it has exceeded the saturation point. If we measure China's current issuance quantity in this way, it not only has not exceeded the saturation point, but is still below the saturation point. In order to respect the banking system and the law, the government did not interfere like other countries during the war. The right to issue is still in the hands of the four banks, China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, and the issuance reserves are still submitted and kept by the banks in accordance with the law. The government is only exercising supervision in accordance with laws and regulations. The rumors of currency inflation are absolutely untrue.</p>

<p>Russian emigrant, Ouchakovsky (63 years old), and his Polish wife, Vocha Kwov Si Quanya Mariya (60 years old), have lived in China for eight or nine years. They are deeply admired for the long history of Chinese culture and the diligence of the nation, as infected by their daily life. In February of this year, they wrote to the National Government requesting to join Chinese nationality and be Chinese people forever. After examination by the National Government, it was recognized that they had lived in China for more than the statutory five years, were usually law-abiding, and obeyed Chinese laws.

<p>The interim report of the Economic Committee of the Municipal Council recommended that the Russian Corps of the Merchant Corps be incorporated into the Police Department. This has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Bureau at its regular meeting on the 24th of this month. Last night (25th), the Director-General of the Bureau summoned the officers of the Russian Corps to the meeting room of the Bureau to give instructions and explain the intention of the Bureau to incorporate the team into the Police Department.</p>
<p>Director-General's Admonition</p>
<p>He said that the Bureau greatly appreciated the work of the Russian Corps. According to the Chief of Police, he hoped to use the team as an "armed reserve team" of the Police Department, gradually implement police training, and increase the effectiveness of the team. At present, the organization of the team will not be changed, and it will be gradually adjusted in the future. Currently, the badges of all levels of the team will be maintained, and honorary police ranks will be awarded in the future. As for</p>
<p>Management System</p>
<p>The Police Department has no intention of changing it. The above plan is regarded as excellent by the President and all directors.

<p>The Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office, because the abominable profiteers raised prices indiscriminately and made illegal profits, and it was difficult to impose punishment without conclusive evidence, specifically appealed to the citizens to cooperate with the Office. If any merchants made illegal profits, they should be reported to curb prices and reduce the burden of public life. In order to respond to this appeal, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation specifically notified citizens to urge them to care about the work of the Price Office and cooperate with it. The Association's notice includes the following items: (1) Those who refuse to implement the stipulated price for necessities; (2) Those who charge particularly high prices for the same item; (3) Those who deduct quantity in an improper way; (4) Those who violate the price limit regulations; (5) Those who have evidence of monopolizing necessities; (6) Other those who seek undue profits and affect public life, should be reported to the Municipal Council's Price Office so that the Office can adjudicate them.</p>

<p>Reuters Shanghai News, the British Embassy recently issued the following statement to the newspapers: Regarding the Shanghai news quoted by the Allied Press from the Tokyo dispatch of the Haitong News Agency this month, "The British Far East Fleet" has set sail from Singapore, either to the Mediterranean or to the East African coast, etc. The German news agency seems to be quite vague about the actions of the British ships in the Far East during the declaration of war. Their attention to the British aircraft carrier "Eagle" is reminiscent of their similar attention to another British aircraft carrier "Five Acre". They have repeatedly published unwarranted words in an attempt to discover its whereabouts, and even later they declared that the ship had sunk. The publication of the actions of the British aircraft carrier "Eagle" or any British ship, regardless of size, will only benefit our enemies. The British authorities will never be sold to this obvious trick.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Apongte, a Far East correspondent for the New York Times, told everyone at the Japanese-hosted press conference yesterday (the 24th) that at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday, a Japanese man accompanied by a tall Chinese man, using the excuse of receiving a call to repair the typewriter, attempted to break into the New York Times office in the HSBC Building on Sichuan Road, i.e., Mr. A's office, but was stopped by two Chinese and Indian arresters.

<p>Because the population of Shanghai has increased several times after the war, and because nineteen are from the countryside, the Municipal Council has tried its best to promote the safety of travel and all necessary measures. However, due to the density of the population, fires are most likely to occur, and celluloid manufacturing and other items in industry are particularly prone to disasters. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the Property Regulations, those who want to preserve, store, manufacture, or sell the above items or soluble cotton-like nitrocellulose paint and other materials must be banned, and at the same time, forty-eight Celluloid License Regulations must be ordered to all merchants to comply with and register.</p>

<p>The five iron gates of the French Concession adjacent to Nanshi have been fully opened since the 18th, after being temporarily closed due to the strike of the French Concession Tramway Company. However, the Japanese army's inspection of residents entering and leaving is very harsh.

However, it is difficult to determine whether this can be implemented at that time.</p>

<p>Zhenhai has been completely recovered, and the war in eastern Zhejiang has stopped. However, the shipping lines on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have not yet been restored. Local shipping companies have now telegraphed the Ningbo Management Office regarding the current situation and shipping conditions. However, because the Japanese side used the excuse of "military needs," and blocked the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, Japanese warships gathered near Zhenhai, and the round-trip of ships was still hindered. The Jianghai Customs also complied with the Japanese request and stopped the trade closure. As of yesterday afternoon, the Ningbo shipping line has not yet resumed closure. In the future, if the resumption of navigation is realized, the ships will only be allowed to berth and unload at the port of Zhenhai, and passengers will be transferred by small boats. It is impossible to sail into the north bank of Yongjiang by the port of Zhenhai again, because the original blockade line gap of the port of Zhenhai has been blocked, and the new blockade line of Yongjiang Meilu has no gap for navigation.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs has not yet allowed the closure of Minjiang Hanjiang Sanzhe Aojiang Yongjiang ports. However, foreign shipping circles are trying to restore shipping. The Minhe wheel of the Youlin Yanghang, which arrived in Shanghai from Wen yesterday afternoon, had no unusual action from the four Japanese warships parked at the mouth of the Oujiang River when it left the mouth of the Oujiang River. The ship will still sail to Wenzhou tomorrow. The De Shang Feikang wheel, which arrived in Shanghai from Wen the day before yesterday, was still parked at the Roosevelt Wharf yesterday, and its whereabouts are uncertain. The Pauli wheel of the Huayi Yanghang is temporarily not sailing because it needs to be repaired in Shanghai.</p>

The Xinanna wheel of the Fusheng Company of British merchants was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Xinghua at 3:00 pm yesterday, but it was delayed until 5:00 am this morning due to incomplete loading.

<h3 id="e73">National Goods Merchant Fang Yixian Abducted Yesterday Morning; Resistance by Escort Results in Severe Gunshot Wound <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10:50 AM, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred on Singapore Road in western Shanghai. The victim was Fang Yixian, a native of Ningbo, who is the chairman and general manager of the China National Goods Company and the general manager of the China Chemical Industry Society in this city. On the spot, Fang's escort, Chen Pusheng, drew his gun and fought with the bandits. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers returned fire with six or seven shots, and the escort was shot in the head, bleeding profusely. The victim was ultimately snatched from his own car by the bandits and placed in a large black car they had prepared in advance, speeding away westward. The details are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Following Routine for Outside Office Work Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Fang Yixian is a native of Ningbo, 48 years old, residing at No. 10 Singapore Road in western Shanghai, in a self-built Western-style house. He also has two cars for transportation, one numbered 2274 and the other numbered 4604, an Austin model. Mr. Fang has a personal handgun and employs two escorts, one being Chen Pusheng (48 years old) from Shandong, who has been with him for many years, and another whose name is unknown. He also employs Jiang Rubin, a native of Jiancheng, as a driver, known for his loyalty and careful service. Yesterday morning, around 10:50 AM, Fang followed his routine, taking his car to the Chemical Industry Society and other places for office work.</p>
<p>Sudden Encounter with Kidnappers; Escort Shot</p>
<p>Fang, after being in the courtyard, boarded the car with escort Chen Pusheng. The driver, Jiang Rubin, started the No. 4604 Austin car, and as the car reached the middle of the road, four kidnappers suddenly approached from the roadside, each with a box cannon, crowding forward and ordering the car to stop, forcing the driver, Jiang Rubin, to get out and leave. At this time, Fang's escort, Chen Pusheng, realized these were not good people and, to protect his master, quickly drew his gun and fired a shot. Unexpectedly, the bandits fired simultaneously. Fang Yixian, seeing the unfavorable situation, quickly ducked onto the car seat, narrowly avoiding injury. As a result, the escort Chen Pusheng was shot in the head, bleeding profusely, losing his ability to resist. The driver, seeing this, was greatly alarmed and was forced out of the car. At that time, Fang's other escort happened to be at the entrance of the alley next to Fang's residence, resting due to illness that day and not carrying a handgun, thus witnessing his master being kidnapped without being able to help.</p>
<p>Forcibly Taken onto Bandit's Car and Speeded Away</p>
<p>The bandits then forcibly dragged Fang out of the car, put him into a large black car they had prepared, and immediately sped away, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the driver, Jiang Rubin, went inside and reported the kidnapping situation to the house's accountant. He then reported to the local Gordon Road Police Station. Shortly after, Western and Chinese detectives were dispatched to the scene to investigate, and they collected the bullet casings left behind by the bandits, taking them back to the police station for examination. At the same time, an ambulance was urgently summoned and rushed the injured Chen Pusheng to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The injury was to the head, grazing the back of the head, and the situation was very critical. As for Fang's whereabouts, there was still no news as of 7:00 PM. The Gordon Road Police Station is currently conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<p>Kidnapping May Be a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>When reporters rushed to Fang's residence to investigate afterwards, it was learned that Fang had been resting at home for several days due to illness and had only recently recovered, starting to go to the National Goods Company and Chemical Industry Society for office work as usual. It was reported that when the incident occurred, the escort fought with the bandits, and the bandits fired six or seven shots. The rear window of Fang's No. 4604 Austin car was shattered, and the car body was full of bullet holes. Mr. Fang is a merchant who lives frugally and dedicates himself to the national goods business, not usually involving himself in external affairs. His business has also not shown much improvement due to the influence of the current situation. It is still unknown whether this kidnapping was due to a misunderstanding. It was also learned that in addition to the old residence on Singapore Road, Mr. Fang also has a concubine residing in a Western-style house at No. 760 Hart Road, with two sons and one daughter, all of whom are young and born to the concubine. His first wife, née Jie, is 49 years old and also from Ningbo.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," just after 10:30 PM last night (the 24th), a bomb was suddenly thrown into the large gambling hall of the Hollywood gambling den at No. 1238 Yuyuan Road, causing a loud explosion. Two gamblers were injured, and the rest were greatly frightened. Initially, people believed this was a political case, but it was later discovered that it was a bombing by gangsters, aiming to take the opportunity to rob a certain wealthy Chinese who gambles there every night. This person had lost all but 200 yuan last night, which was all robbed. The Chinese is lame. He gambles every evening, losing thousands of gold on roulette. A reporter from a certain newspaper in this city was also present at the time. According to reports, after the bomb exploded, the gamblers immediately lay on the ground, fearing a gunfight. The Public Concession Police Department did not receive a report. It is said that after the incident, the owner of the Hollywood gambling den offered cold drinks to the gamblers and reimbursed the lame man with 200 yuan, and the matter was settled. The injured were sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Zhejiang Industrial Bank Sues Meiguang Factory for Debt; Debate Concluded, Judgment Scheduled <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The case of Zhejiang Industrial Bank suing Meiguang Dyeing Factory (office located at No. 119 Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road) for debt and return of a 70,000 yuan transfer order has been heard several times by Judge Mo Runhua of the First Special District Court. Yesterday, Judge Mo opened the court again for further hearing. The plaintiff, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, was still represented by a lawyer, who stated that Meiguang Factory owes the plaintiff an overdraft of more than 100,000 yuan. According to the overdraft contract, there was a provision for early repayment of the debt. In addition, the Ministry of Finance's telegram from Ma arrived in Shanghai in June last year, and the market was inevitably tense. The plaintiff had a regulation to offset deposits against debts for all customers with both deposits and debts. Afterwards, the defendant issued a check for 75,000 yuan, which the plaintiff returned. Then the defendant's legal representative, Jiang Yanwu, came to the bank to request accommodation. The plaintiff stated that offsetting deposits against debts was a standard procedure within the bank and could not be done. Mr. Jiang left without a word. A week later, on June 29, the defendant sent another check for 70,000 yuan, with Deputy Manager Tang Yanxiu personally coming to the bank to withdraw the money. The handling clerk at the time, Zhang Qidong, and Mr. Tang were old classmates and did not examine it carefully, hastily exchanging it for a transfer order of the same amount. Afterwards, it was found that the deposit had already been used to offset the overdraft and should not have been paid. They immediately went to negotiate for the return, but Mr. Tang refused. Clerk Zhang immediately reported to the bank, and the senior staff of the plaintiff's bank notified the Bankers' Association to stop payment. The transfer order is a bank check, issued by the bank issuing the transfer order to the Bankers' Association to withdraw money, and the Bankers' Association transfers the amount. The bank issuing the transfer order is the issuer of ordinary deposits, and the Bankers' Association is no different from the bank paying the check. This is very clear from the wording of the transfer order. Since the transfer order is a check in nature, it is fundamentally different from a bank draft. The plaintiff has already offset the amount of the transfer order against the debt and can of course stop payment to protect the debt. This is understood by anyone who knows a little about banking procedures and should not be misunderstood. However, the defendant knew that this 70,000 yuan transfer order was obtained due to a clerk's mistake and had been requested once by one of the handlers. Therefore, the next day, the defendant used the alias "Shengji" to go to Zhejiang Industrial Bank to open a collection account, and Zhejiang Industrial's accounts had been investigated, and the results showed that there was absolutely no receipt or payment other than the 70,000 yuan transfer order. The slightest clue shows that the defendant used the mistakenly paid transfer order, under the alias "Shengji," but the facts speak louder than words. The so-called "Shengji" is just a fabrication by the defendant to deceive the public and oppose the plaintiff. This is further supported by the testimony of Mr. Jiang Yizhi, who is the uncle and grandfather of the defendant's legal representative, who stated in court, "The 70,000 yuan was used by Fuguang Factory to pay for the stack receipt of Defu Foreign Firm. Because of the stop payment, I was the one who came up with a way to settle it for them."</p>
<p>It is even more obvious that the plaintiff's stop payment and offsetting of the 70,000 yuan transfer order exchanged for the check by the defendant is in accordance with the law. The defendant should not emphasize cunning and deception to confuse the hearing. It should be ordered that the defendant repay the remaining debt and return the 70,000 yuan transfer order to maintain the debt and simplify the procedures. The defendant's lawyer then made a statement, and the court debate concluded, with the judgment scheduled for a later date.</p>

<p>Yang Yongquan, 26 years old, was carrying 2,500 yuan in legal tender at 4:05 PM yesterday, riding in a rickshaw along Kunshan Road, Zhaopu Road, Hongkou, when a robber suddenly blocked him and robbed him of the legal tender he was carrying. Yang resisted slightly at the time, and the robber drew a gun and fired a shot at his leg. The robber then fled. The Chinese police sent Yang to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>At 9:45 PM last night, a public bus heading west stopped at the intersection of Seymour Road and Jing'an Temple Road. Two passengers got off. Shortly after, a man was suddenly robbed by two robbers. The man shouted loudly for the police. Nearby Chinese police officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. The robbers, seeing the police arrive, did not have time to rob anything and turned to flee, firing their guns to resist arrest. The Chinese police chased after them, and at the entrance of Green Field Garden on Dahua Road, the police also drew their guns and returned fire. Many shots were exchanged between the two sides, but the robbers escaped into the crowd and disappeared without a trace. When the police and robbers were shooting, bullets were flying everywhere, and pedestrians fled in panic. A boy, Li Dong (13 years old, from Wusong), residing at No. 247 Chenjia Alley, Aivenyi Road, was hit in the right breast by a stray bullet, which exited from his left back. Yu Yonglu (29 years old, from Ningbo), residing at No. 56 Matt Hess Tal Road, was hit in the left leg by a stray bullet. The Chinese police called an ambulance to send the two to the hospital for treatment. The boy Li Dong's injuries were severe, and his life was in danger. It is said that Yu Yonglu's behavior was suspicious.</p>

<p>The old painter and calligrapher Huang Baoyue suddenly had a relapse of his old hernia illness in mid-June, which was very dangerous. Surgeons Liu Yixiang and Zheng Zumu performed the operation, but due to his old age and weak constitution, his pulse had stopped upon arrival at Shanghai Hospital, and he was unconscious for a long time. Fortunately, various emergency methods were used to turn the danger into safety. He has now been discharged from the hospital and returned to his residence. He is currently cleaning up his post-illness works, and his brushwork feels even more bold than before. His fee remains the same and will not be increased, as he has always wanted to avoid taking too much and use it to form artistic connections.</p>

<p>Deaths from poisoning are frequently reported in this city. One such case involved a child who died from accidentally swallowing insecticide powder. This powder was filled into an ordinary bottle with a screw-top lid and did not have a proper label. After this case occurred, the Shanghai Municipal Council immediately issued a warning to the public, paying extreme attention to it. At the same time, the Health Department was ordered to instruct the sellers of the insecticide powder to follow the measures stipulated by the Health Department to prevent abuses and prevent accidents. The Health Committee of the Municipal Council also raised the issue for discussion at its meeting on the 19th of this month, believing that the Bureau was necessary to take action, resulting in a proposal to the Bureau to improve the current situation. At the same time, the Legal Department also suggested that the Bureau promulgate several rules to improve the method of bottling and labeling poisons. Basically, the Shanghai Municipal Council issued Proclamation No. 5300 on the 25th of this month, stating that the various poisons listed in the attached poison list, except for those compounded in prescriptions, must be labeled with labels printed in red or on red paper with the Chinese and English words "Poison", and must indicate the name of the drug and the name and address of the seller. If it is a liquid and is equipped for distribution in a glass bottle of 100 or fewer liquid ounces, the container should be made with straight ribs or grooves.

<h3 id="e86">Grain: The Public's Food Demand is in Great Demand; A Large Shipment of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai by Ship <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Over 76,100 Bags Yesterday; A Large Amount of Siamese Rice is Expected to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of foreign rice continued to fall, but the Xiaojiao rice was particularly popular, because the Xiaojiao rice traded on the market was nothing more than some stocks in warehouses, and transactions were all "ball games." Therefore, its fluctuations were not affected by actual sales, but were affected by speculation. The opening price was higher than before, reaching 53 yuan, but it closed at 52.3 yuan. As for other foreign rice, of the 100,000 bags jointly operated by rice industry groups, in addition to the 25,000 bags of Hong Kong rice that have arrived in port, the remaining 75,000 bags of Saigon pointed rice will also arrive in Shanghai soon. There is hope for a drop in rice prices. Merchants are waiting and seeing before purchasing, and trying to sell goods. As a result, the closing price fell by another yuan before the war. Grade 1 Chen Saigon rice was only 55.5 yuan, new rice was 53.8 yuan, and special rice was 56 yuan. Among the road goods, the No. 26 loaded road goods and the No. 20 unloaded goods in the warehouse last month were both pressured by silver, so the price was heard to be as low as 61 yuan, then it rose by 1 or 2 cents, and then returned to 61 yuan. The current delivery also opened at 61 yuan and 61.2 yuan, and then at 60.05 yuan, which was about 1 yuan lower than the previous market. The imports and exports of Saigon No. 4 in July were less, and the price stood at 61 yuan, with more than 300 tons opened. Spot goods opened with 3,000 to 4,000 bags, and the opening price was half a yuan lower. Later, the Hangjia inland office settled down.</p>
<p>A large shipment of foreign rice arrived. Just as the Yangxing Dingsheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday evening, carrying 3,835 bags, it docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Guiyang Wheel also arrived the day before yesterday evening, carrying 15,319 bags from Hong Kong, it docked at the Pudong Benhang Wharf and began unloading. Yesterday, the Apoey Wheel, managed by the Zhongyong Shipping Company at 122 Guangdong Road, directly transported more than 37,000 bags from Saigon and docked at the Pudong Longmao Warehouse to unload. Another foreign ship, the Fingl, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying more than 20,000 bags directly from Bianluo. It was originally scheduled to dock at the Pudong Longmao Warehouse, but when it arrived in Shanghai, the ship went straight to the South Huangpu River, so it did not stop at the Longmao Warehouse. It is not yet known where it stopped to unload. A total of more than 76,100 bags of foreign rice arrived in the past two days.</p>
<p>Jing and glutinous domestic rice arrived, with about 1,000 bags of Jing rice. It is rumored that transactions in the dark market followed the decline of foreign rice. The selling price continued to depreciate by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. Changbang Fresh Special Qing Jing rice was 68 yuan, Special Qing Jing rice was 67 yuan, Wuxi Qing Jing rice was 66.5 yuan, 66 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Jing rice was 65 yuan, 6 yuan, and the second-grade rice was 62 yuan. Qingsi Bo Dao rice was 66 yuan, 7 yuan, Nangang early rice was 62 yuan, 3 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan rice was 61 yuan, 2 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan rice was 59 yuan, and the second-grade Su Huang rice was 56 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Flour Decreases by Two Cents; Chinese Factories Buy Wheat at Two Yuan More <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's factory price of flour was changed to 15.5 yuan, which was two cents lower than before, because the sales in the local market have been quite sluggish recently. Most people think the price is too high and are waiting to see. The factories, however, have seen the price of wheat they are purchasing gradually decrease, so they have lowered the factory price to attract customers. The total number of bags purchased by the two factories in the city has also increased to 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The price of Japanese flour and miscellaneous domestic flour has gradually stabilized. It is reported that the Phoenix brand opened at 14.2 yuan, and the Jinshan brand opened at 15.5 yuan, with 200 to 300 bags transacted for each.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market continued to have no opening in the morning, and the market price was secretly loosening. The current stocks are sufficient, Japanese factories are waiting to see, and Chinese factories are also thinking of suppressing prices to purchase, so the buying and selling are becoming more and more cautious. It is reported that the Japanese factories have entered the 20 yuan mark, and the Chinese factories are offering 2 yuan or more higher, but there are still only one or two trucks of sporadic transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Finance: The Foreign Exchange Market is Quiet <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market situation was that HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market of British and American exchanges remained stable throughout. There was no speculative nature in the transactions. The whole day was swap trading. In the July to August US dollar swap, the Chinese and foreign banks swapped at 0.0625. A foreign bank traded British for American, about 3.7425 yuan for the US-British exchange rate. At that time, the US dollar gradually hardened, and the US exchange rate slightly shrunk. The market outlook was calm and unchanged. The closing market was not much different from the previous day, and so were the futures.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Hedging Exchange Rates</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large strips fell nearly 0.0625, and the forward rate was stable. New York silver prices did not move, and London gold remained stable. The exchange rate of British to American was as before, and there was no change against Shanghai. The American to British exchange rate was 5 points longer, 6 points longer against Shanghai, and there was no market against France. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 3 pence 875 for British gold and 6.15625 yuan for US exchange, which was tighter by 0.015625 for British and longer by 0.03125 for US compared to the previous day's closing price. This was due to the exchange rate rebound. After the opening, the market was extremely quiet, and the potential was quite flat. It is estimated that foreign banks sold spot US exchange to Chinese banks at 6.15625 yuan, and Chinese merchants also sold spot US exchange to Chinese banks through Yangjia at 6.15625 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.50 percent. After that, only swap transactions were heard. It is estimated that HSBC had a favorable American bank that bought US exchange for July at 6.15625 yuan and sold US exchange for August at 6.09375 yuan, with a discount of 0.0625. Later, it was learned that a foreign bank was doing a US-British exchange rate of 3.7825 yuan, and at this time, the British bank's entry into foreign banks this month was slightly longer to 3 pence 90625, and the American bank's exit from foreign banks this month was still 6.15625 yuan. The closing price at noon was 3 pence 90625 for gold and 6.125 yuan for US exchange, which was longer by 0.03125 for British and softer by 0.03125 for US compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Long-Term Swap</p>
<p>The market in the afternoon was still lackluster, and most of the transactions were swaps. It is estimated that Chinese banks swapped with foreign banks, with a selling price of 6.15625 yuan for July and 6.09375 yuan for August. It is estimated that Chinese banks discounted 0.0625. The general market was the same. The evening closing was 3 pence 890625 for British gold and 6.125 yuan for US exchange, and 3 pence 859375 for British gold and 6.0625 yuan for US exchange in August, which was neither glorious nor disgraceful compared to yesterday's spot and futures.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market is Quiet</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Thursday) Electric: The exchange market opened steadily this morning, and all exchanges were generally neither glorious nor disgraceful. At 11:30, it was quiet and lifeless. The Shanghai exchange spot rose by one yuan, to 312 yuan. The "United Notes" black market also rose by two and a half cents, to 94.75 yuan. At 2:30 in the afternoon, the opening was stable, and all exchanges were generally neither up nor down.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market is Unchanged</p>
<p>Tianjin, 25th (Thursday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning, and the spot prices of British and American exchanges were generally neither glorious nor disgraceful. The Shanghai exchange rose by two and a half cents, to 107 yuan, and the "United Notes" black market also rose by two and a half cents, to 94.75 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Lack of Capital for Bullion Speculation; Gold Market at a Standstill <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market situation, the changes were still subtle, especially in the afternoon, there was direct talk in the market, and there were few traders, so the closing time was as early as 2:30. In terms of trends, the morning was the best. The opening price was 5,280 yuan, and after a slight absorption by a money exchange shop, it rose by another 5 yuan. Then, due to the tightening of the US exchange rate, it was suppressed by the Tianjin gang, and fell by more than 20 yuan. It closed at 5,266 yuan in the afternoon. The opening of the market outlook was still small, and then it relied on the entry of securities gangs and silver houses, but both sides had little capital, and it soon rose. The closing price then returned to 5,275 yuan, which was 12 yuan higher than the previous day. The overall transaction was flat, only about 1,000 taels. The jewelry gold of silver shops remained flat, and the customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Bullion Only Rose by 12 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each strip (ten taels), the human sentiment was still good due to the sudden tightening of the US exchange rate after the relaxation. First, a silver shop entered 20 taels of gold shops, rising to 5,280 yuan, which was 17 yuan higher than the previous closing. Then, relying on the absorption of a money exchange shop, it was pulled up another 5 yuan. The money exchange shop entered 10 taels of silver shops, at 5,285 yuan. However, the number of buyers decreased after that, and a silver shop saw that the price was high and agreed to sell, so the market situation suddenly changed, and soon a gold shop and a small money shop secretly helped customers to spit out, so it returned down more than ten yuan. A silver shop exited 10 taels of gold shops, worse than 5,262 yuan. In the afternoon, the silver shop gang slightly recovered, and it was good again by four yuan. Silver shops did 30 taels mutually, at 5,266 yuan, as the noon closing price. The market opened slightly lower by one yuan in the afternoon. A securities gang exited 10 taels of silver shops, at 5,265 yuan. Then a securities gang suddenly came to drag in, and silver shops also bought in succession, and it was immediately raised by ten yuan. Jewelry shops entered 50 taels of silver shops, etc., at 5,275 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it rebounded 12 yuan from the previous day, and the fluctuations throughout the day were only 23 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash gold shop was more than ten yuan higher than the bullion, and the purchase price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and both were rarely traded.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still Hung at the Original Price</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops remained stable, and Datonghang still hung at 540 yuan. The new peers were similar to the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about thirty yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Flying Flowers <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Shiqi</p>
<p>Flying flowers are waste cotton (commonly known as underfoot flower clothing) that is removed several times in the cotton spinning process in yarn factories. There are dozens of types of flying flowers. Because they are removed at different times, they can be divided into different grades.</p>
<p>(Upper-grade flying flowers) are almost the same as raw cotton, such as Villali, so their value is also high. For example, in March of this year, Pudong Huoji Flower rose to the highest peak of 230 yuan. At this time, upper-grade flying flowers such as Chao Gangsi (flying flower title) also cost 200 yuan. About 80% of the upper-grade flying flowers are sold to small spinning mills to spin coarse yarn, and 10% are used to make cotton pads and flower rolls. This type of upper-grade flying flower accounts for about 10% of all flying flowers produced by yarn factories.</p>
<p>(Medium and lower-grade flying flowers) must be sorted before a small portion is mixed into upper-grade flying flowers. The remaining majority is exported overseas. The lowest-grade flying flowers left after several sorting processes are called garbage (i.e., cotton lint and flower shells). This type of garbage is all sold to tofu shops to be used as fuel, and there is still a demand that exceeds supply.</p>
<p>The quality of all flying flowers produced by each yarn factory is not uniform. It is inversely proportional to the quality of the spinning machines. For example, British-owned Ewo produces less flying flowers and less quality. On the contrary, if the spinning machines are old and outdated, the raw cotton consumed will be heavily discounted, resulting in a large amount of high-quality flying flowers, which is very suitable for the flying flower industry.</p>
<p>(Sometimes the quality of flying flowers) is related to the raw materials purchased by the yarn factory. Recently, for example, a factory used a large number of low-grade Indian Pingle (Indian cotton), which resulted in the poor quality of its flying flowers.</p>
<p>90% of flying flowers are sold overseas, especially in Europe. Export trading companies set up by European and American countries in Shanghai have daily contact with them. Compared with trading with British gentlemen, it is quick and smooth. The French are sincere and enthusiastic, and the German merchants' lightning-style large transactions are especially welcomed by us Chinese. American merchants must have three basic principles: good quality, low price, and fast delivery, before negotiations can be held. Otherwise, if there are any difficulties in delivery, there is absolutely no room for negotiation.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the flying flower industry has been the first to be affected. The prices of all grades of flying flowers have plummeted, and it is difficult to sell them even at low prices. Although American merchants can still trade, they usually do not have large transactions, resulting in a supply that exceeds demand, and the market situation is declining.</p>
<p>Recently, a small number of peers have used a certain proportion to calculate and compete to purchase No. 1 Raw Silk (flying flower title) and hoard it in warehouses. Therefore, the Xinyu Yarn Factory's factory price soared by 4 yuan in two days from the 18th to the 19th of this month. Mr. Zhang purchased 200 dan, the price was 50 yuan. Mr. Xia purchased 100 dan, the price was 52 yuan. Mr. Han purchased 50 dan, the price was 54 yuan. Later, Mr. Wang suddenly purchased 300 dan at the Shenxin No. 2 Factory at a high price of 59 yuan. All these orders are based on speculative vision to hoard goods, and the future success or failure is unknown.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, bullion was stable and even more stable, and finally slightly rose. British and American gold pounds also rose by 5 cents each. The supply and demand of British gold notes remained balanced, and the market price remained at the same level. American gold notes were still in a narrow range, and finally slightly rose by 1 cent. Hong Kong notes suddenly had a supply, and the market price tended to be stable. The demand for Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was very strong, and the market prices continued to rise in unison. The former was 1.23 yuan, and the latter was 1.07 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Yarn and Flowers; The Yarn Market is Brewing <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but sales to customers are more active. The purchase of goods by the South China Hong Kong gang is gradually showing prosperity, so human sentiment is boosted. As for a major player among peers who is optimistic, he has resumed purchasing 20-count Double Horse Factory singles, so the situation is consolidated again. However, scattered records are not optimistic, and the future of the market is feared to change. However, the exchange rate and gold are still in a flat situation.</p>
<p>In the current yarn market, there are some people grabbing hats in the morning. It is heard that customers have sales, and they all grab in, and the price opens high at 940 yuan. After a while, a company vomited it out again, and it loosened again to 933 yuan, but a Fenghao suddenly came to absorb it, and it rose again. It was flat in the middle, but actual sales were more than before. It is found that the turnover in half a day was 2,030 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 4 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 200 packages of 10-count Boy Scouts, and the price was 610 yuan. It is currently being shipped, and 250 pieces of yarn will be transported to Fujian today. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,010 Peers 1,020</p>
<p>Total 2,030</p>
<h3 id="e93">Manufacturers are Watching Cotton <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation, the transaction is slightly active, but the attitude of the factories is still stable as always, and there is no sign of large-scale development. However, there are occasional transactions among peers, but the market price has not increased much. Taicang flower is 157 yuan, and 190 packages were entered among peers. Pingle is 145 yuan, 6 yuan, and 300 pieces were transacted among peers, all for immediate delivery.</p>
<p>In another news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was firm from the beginning of the morning. Speculators bought a little, and later because the weather report in the cotton area was bad, and some spot merchants bought, the closing price rose more than ten pounds than the previous day. Yesterday's Indian cotton market, including forecasts, rose by three rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction was extremely quiet, and all parties maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Unless the price is particularly cheap, Japanese manufacturers have not shown any intention. It is expected that the end of the month is approaching, and all parties plan to rest for a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Securities: The Multilateral Side Dominates Domestic Debt <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(Securities Black Market) Yesterday's market slowly trended firmer again. There were more buyers in the market, and it was not easy for the market to fall. Although it was due to the expiration of interest, it was still a superficial phenomenon. The news of peace was constant, so the multilateral side in the market gradually gained strength, and someone bought in as soon as it fell slightly. The trading was flat yesterday morning. Hongda and No. 38 were bought in a little. Lianyi was sold yesterday, and the market was firm and flat. Buyers gradually became stronger in the afternoon. Hongda continued to search and purchase, and Lemao also had strong demand. Zhenchang, Xinfu, etc. all had income. Although Jiufu, Jiufeng, Hongkang, and Tongyu, etc. supplied different amounts, the market atmosphere was still dominated by the multilateral side. Therefore, as a result, except for Dingzhong, which was slightly down by 5 cents, the rest all rebounded by 1.5 to 3 cents. The total number of transactions was about 70 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the previous day</p>

<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's spot sales were still good, Dongpi's leading prices rebounded after falling, and the market atmosphere turned stable. Hoarders and peers absorbed goods at low prices, and transactions were very prosperous. As the end of the month is approaching, goods due are being sold off continuously, all because the factory prices are cheap. Yesterday, the cloth prices fluctuated extremely subtly. Scattered hand goods were 1 cent to 2.5 cents cheaper than the market. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs purchased hundreds of pieces of fine cloth twill color cloth. The Wenzhou gang purchased more than one hundred pieces of fine twill fine cloth coarse cloth color cloth. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth: First fell and then rebounded, the leading fine cloth Xinzhancan high offer was over 28 yuan, and the after-market price fell back to 27 yuan, 7 yuan, and 8 cents, which was not much different from the previous day, while the old Zancan single was too far apart, and rebounded to 26 yuan, 5 cents, up 7.5 cents. The trend of medium-grade fine cloth and twill is still soft. The cheapest price for Four Gentlemen's Biji in the morning market was 8 cents and 3 points, and it rebounded to about 8 cents and 4 points in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Export: 410 pieces of cotton cloth will be transported to Fujian today.</p>

<p>The foreign silk market is flat and does not increase. Yokohama spot opened at the original price, and the forward price was a small 7 yuan. The New York spot price did not move, the recent price rose by 2.5 cents, and the recent price rose by half a cent.</p>
<p>The local foreign banks only had short-covering transactions, because the Shanghai Baichang sold at 2.08 yuan per pound, which is equivalent to 4,400 to 4,500 yuan in the Shanghai market, and because the Shanghai hand goods are very thin, the selling price is 4,700 yuan. However, there were very few transactions, only about 20 dan were traded yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Green Tea Sales to the US are Slightly Active <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The sales of local foreign tea dealers' green tea have been sharply reduced since Italy implemented the war. In recent weeks, the sales of ordinary Zhenmei with core extraction to Morocco have been sluggish as before. However, the sales of American green tea in Japan have begun to move. Non-colored shrimp eye pearl tea has been quite popular. Tongfu, Jinlong, and other firms continued to purchase 200 boxes in the market yesterday, with prices opening at 245 yuan to 300 yuan. There are also telephone calls from various parties to purchase Fengmei and Zhenmei goods, and the market situation is brewing.</p>

<p>The yellow soybean market situation, because it is at the time when the old and new are not connected, the source is rare, so the local stock is becoming more and more empty. Although the sales market has decreased, the continuous movement is still not lonely, and the overall situation has improved as a result. The market price has gradually tightened. Yesterday, the local Nanyang gang and others purchased more than 400 bags of Anqing beans, the price was 27.7 yuan to 28 yuan, more than 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans, the price was 25 yuan, 6 yuan, more than 300 bags of Pudong Du beans, the price was 9 yuan, 4 yuan, the second grade was 27.6 yuan, and 70 bags of Dayun Jiaqing beans, the price was 31 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Sugar Market: Car White Plummets by Five Dollars <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a sharp decline because Taikoo Sugar Refinery in Hong Kong, given the low prices of Dutch machine whites, feared being monopolized in the market. Therefore, they engaged in price-cutting sales. It was rumored that B-mark sugar could be sold for around HK$13.25, leading the Guild to drastically lower the price of car white sugar. B-mark opened in the morning at $76.5, $76.4, $76.3, and $76.50, but fell to as low as $72.5 in the afternoon, a total drop of $5.10. DY-mark sugar was at $70, and 24 Dutch coarse whites also showed signs of easing. Sugar from this establishment was priced at $67.5, $67.6, $67.5, while sugar from other establishments was at $67.3, $67.6, $67.6, $67.5, a drop of $2.56.

<p>Because it is not the peak season for sales of thread vermicelli, and the weather is dry, making the quality easily brittle, market prices are gradually easing. Yesterday, a batch of Qingdao vermicelli was released, priced at $80, a drop of more than $5.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Coal: Bituminous Coal Sales Stagnant <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The bituminous coal market remains sluggish, mainly because many factories, especially small-scale factories, have suspended operations, leading to stagnant sales. Consequently, market prices are unlikely to rebound. Yesterday, Borneo bituminous coal secretly dropped another $10, with the ex-carriage price calculated at $170 per ton, gate-front capacity, screened lumps at $190 per ton, and coal dust at $160, delivered to customers, including commission.</p>

<p>Strange Tales of Thunder and Rain</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fifth day of this month, there was heavy rain in this port, accompanied by thunder and lightning, which was truly shocking to hear and see. Afterwards, on a small stream near the Grand Parade Ground, a bridge made of coffin lids was suddenly struck by a thunderbolt and shattered. At the same time, a giant snake inside was also killed by the thunder. Villagers gathered to watch, and some took it away and weighed it, finding it weighed twenty catties. In another village, a hollow tree was also struck by lightning, and a giant snake inside was also killed. At that time, a child was walking in the rain when his hair was suddenly singed off by electric fire, but he felt no pain at all. These are all strange events.</p>
<p>Black Air in the Garden</p>
<p>In the city of Wuxi County, there was formerly a Qin family garden. After the Gengshen Rebellion of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the pavilions and towers in the garden were destroyed and no longer exist. All that remains are old trees and scattered vegetation, overgrown with weeds. The garden owner had no time to repair it, so he built walls around it and kept it locked all year round. It has long been inhabited by foxes and聚, and not visited by people. In the early afternoon of the month, a streak of black air was seen in the garden, soaring into the sky, like clouds but not clouds, like smoke but not smoke. It dispersed only at dusk and reappeared the next day. This continued for several days, and those who saw it were all amazed! From then on, from the city to the countryside, from near to far, the news spread, and everyone wanted to see it first. The front, back, left, and right sides of the garden were packed with people, almost like swarms of bees and ants. The owner, seeing its strangeness and fearing that the crowds would cause trouble, dared not unlock the gates. As for what kind of monster it was, no one could guess.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Cost of Living Index and Cost of Living Allowances <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>It is said that the cost of living index was invented in 1738 by a man named Dutot. Investigating its origin is not our research object. What we need to understand is the meaning of the cost of living index, especially through it to observe the seriousness of living problems.</p>
<p>The function of the cost of living index is quite simple. It is itself a kind of statistics, that is, within a certain period (such as a month), the increase or decrease of various commodity prices is recorded, and then classified (for example, rice and wheat are classified as food). To find its average, so that people can see at a glance the index of commodity price increases and decreases from the previous period to the later period, so it is also called a commodity price index.</p>
<p>If you pay a little attention to the newspaper, then we can see in the first ten days of each month the workers' cost of living index published by the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Public Concession Board of Works for the previous month. Why is a worker's cost of living index specially compiled? Because workers are the most miserable and the largest number of people, generally speaking, they can include general salaried classes.</p>
<p>The cost of living index of the Public Works Bureau is based on the 25th year of the Republic of China (that is, the year before August 13th). For example, for the food category, 100.00 in the 25th year of the Republic of China, but it rose to 132.38 in March of the 28th year, and then rose to 365.15 in March of this year, and 451.74 in June. This means that the price of food in June of this year is exactly four and a half times that of the 25th year of the Republic of China. In other aspects, such as rent, it has reached 304.83, clothing 360.00, fuel 452.20, groceries 394.55, and its total index is 422.91. This tells us that as of June of this year, prices are more than four times the prices of the 25th year. In this way, you may wish to divide one yuan of legal tender by 422.91, which is 23.65. This means that the purchasing power of one yuan of legal tender now is only worth two corners and three cents in the 25th year.</p>
<p>The cost of living index has risen so terribly, and life is certainly threatened. If you used to eat delicacies, then now you can switch to green vegetables and bean curd, but what about the employees who have always eaten rice with salted vegetables and radish? Can you ask them to eat half a bowl? Of course it can't be done, so is there a solution? This is the "cost of living allowance" proposed by many people.</p>
<p>For the sake of allowances, many people have shed blood and sat in prison. Although many businesses have already implemented cost of living allowances today, the number is pitifully small. If someone were to do a statistic, I believe it would never exceed twice.</p>
<p>Then, with prices rising more than fourfold now, the seriousness of the lives of the salaried classes can be imagined.</p>
<p>But the facts show us that, judging from the business conditions of various businesses, allowing cost of living allowances to closely follow the cost of living index is very promising.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Pawn Tickets <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xi</p>
<p>It is a matter of course to go to a pawnshop when you cannot make a living, but the heavy interest of three cents per month (recently implemented) has made friends who generally go to pawnshops feel overwhelmed. The Shanghai people are smart after all. Some pawnshops have appeared in many postwar "redemption on behalf of customers" businesses. They have accurately determined that the ability of ordinary people to redeem is weak, so they offer considerable consideration to collect the pawn tickets, and then redeem the things and sell them. Because everything is expensive, they have a very high profit in one turn. Although this illegal business has been banned, another more cruel exploitation profession, pawn ticket collateral, has recently emerged.</p>
<p>This kind of business is mostly popular in the gatherings of poor laborers. Those engaged in this business are unemployed idlers who have borrowed some local evil forces to start this illegal business. All unexpired pawn tickets can be pledged for 20% of the face value, while the interest rate is 30% per period. They take five days as a period, and can allow two days, that is, a week. If the ticket is not redeemed when it expires, it is regarded as voluntarily giving up the ownership of the ticket, and they will redeem the things and buy them. For example, a pawn ticket for five yuan can be pledged for one yuan, and the interest will be three corners. If the ticket is redeemed when it expires, you have to pay one yuan and three corners. If you don't have the ability to redeem it, you have to pay the interest of three corners. If such a pawn ticket is redeemed after one month, you have to pay the principal and interest of two yuan and two corners. What a cruel transaction this is! Although they know that they have to pay very vicious interest, the poor people have no choice but to let them slaughter when they feel they have nowhere to go.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Reply to "About Riddles" <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Jun You</p>
<p>In yesterday's issue, San San's "About Riddles" I believe his indications are not appropriate, so I offer the following answers.</p>
<p>1. If "the bond of one silk factory" is guessed as "統", it is also correct.</p>
<p>2. "Half on top, remove half, and there is still half left," San San ignored the "有" character on the top half and the "有" character on the bottom half. The riddle's answer, "隨," the妙is in the character "有." Otherwise, it would be difficult to solve. Observe the character "隨." The "阝" on the left is the "除" character with half removed. The "" on the upper right is the top half of the "有" character, "." The "工" character below is half of the "空" character. The "月" below "左" is exactly the bottom half of the "有" character. Is the "辶" below that not half of the "還" character? If you think about its taste carefully, it is quite interesting.</p>
<p>3. The answer to the riddle "pawn ticket" is actually "two years without returning home, marrying someone else." San San mistakenly thought it was another riddle, so naturally "the text does not match the topic."</p>
<p>4. "What brother knows," guessing the name of a county as "Kunming" is quite correct. The character "昆" is the "昆" of "昆仲", that is, the brother's character. "昆明" means "brother understands," San San intends to change the riddle to "brothers compete for military service," I don't know what he means.</p>

<p>Chapter Four: Several Guesses</p>
<p>Regarding the murder that occurred last night, Yi Lan was truly baffled. She admitted herself that once she fell asleep, it was like being dead, not even hearing the gunshots, until Jin Mei sent Lao Mao out and then went to her room to wake her up. Therefore, she really didn't have any useful information about what happened last night. Ni Jinshou, disappointed, dismissed Wu Ma and put the notebook in his pocket, requesting to begin discussing the details of this mysterious case with Huo Sang.</p>
<p>Before expressing his opinion, Huo Sang picked up the blue velvet short coat on the lounge chair and examined it again. From the inner pocket of the coat, he retrieved a small white linen handkerchief, a small silver-threaded purse, which contained nothing important, just a few cosmetics. A small gold powder box, with a mirror attached to the lid, a small piece of lipstick about the size of a pencil, a small ink stick for drawing eyebrows, nearly a hundred yuan in banknotes, mostly ten-yuan bills, a small wristwatch, and two keys. Huo Sang reopened the iron box and, together with Ni Jinshou, checked its contents. Inside the iron box was indeed a small jewelry box, containing many ornaments made of pearls, diamonds, jade, and gemstones: such as gold bracelets, pearl necklaces, earrings, rings, and the like, estimated to be worth at least ten thousand or more. However, the milk-pearl earrings that Jin Mei had mentioned were not in it.</p>
<p>Huo Sang paced back and forth in the living room and slowly said, "Brother Jinshou, this matter is indeed very complex, and there are many contradictions and conflicts. It's not easy to come up with a reasonable explanation right now."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Then, let's make a hypothesis. Based on the facts we know, the one named Yu seems to be the most suspicious."</p>
<p>Huo Sang suddenly stopped and shook his head, saying, "Too early, too early. We can't be so arbitrary. The facts we have gathered are not sufficient. We can't assume who is the most suspicious just yet. What we can discuss now is only guessing about the deceased's actions."</p>
<p>"Okay, how do we guess?"</p>
<p>"First, this woman, as we know, clearly had relationships with four men at the same time. (Five Six)"</p>
<h3 id="e108">Economical, Clean, and Sanitary Bathing Method <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— By Mi Cheng</p>
<p>In the hot summer, bathing should be an indispensable thing, right!</p>
<p>When bathing, most people like to use soap, but this is actually a very uneconomical method. One reason is that it's not economical. At a time when prices are soaring, a bar of bath soap or scented soap costs at least thirty or forty cents. If you use ordinary laundry soap, it's too alkaline, harmful to the skin, and in any case, it always costs money. Another reason is that it's not clean. The reader may find this strange at first, but it's actually true. Let's try applying soap to our hands, rubbing them together, and after a while, washing off the soap and drying them. The hands seem very white and clean, but if we use a dry towel or our hands to rub our backs of our hands vigorously, then layers of dirt will inevitably emerge. This can be clear proof that soap cannot completely wash away dirt. The same applies to washing hands as to bathing, and it's even more troublesome. You have to rub and wash, wash and rub, to be completely clean. This is not only expensive but also annoying, isn't it a foolish thing? Now let me introduce an economical, clean, and sanitary bathing method. You should use cold water for your bath water, and don't wet your whole body first (even if it's wet, wait for it to gradually dry, making sure that only a little moisture remains on your body). You should use one or two fingers to dip in water and apply it evenly and thinly on your body, just enough to moisten the surface but not to wet it. Then you can use a dry palm to carefully rub the watered area vigorously. Then, the many layers of dirt accumulated on the surface and in the pores will be completely rubbed out, leaving none behind. After you have rubbed one area well, repeat the same method on other areas. When you have rubbed your whole body, your body will also be covered with dirt. At this time, just wash it off with water and then wipe it dry with a dry towel to make your skin rosy. Your bath is quickly finished.</p>
<p>This kind of bathing method has several advantages: no soap, no hot water, economical and saving, first; all the dirt is rubbed off and cleaned at once, clean and simple, second; washing with cold water and then rubbing it to make the skin rosy and blood circulate is beneficial to hygiene, third, it can be said to be killing three birds with one stone. And I have introduced it to several friends, who are quite satisfied. Readers, why not try it?</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Tragedy of the Movie Emperor <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— By Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Michel Ronay, the lead actor in "Qing Qing Zhi Huo" (Burning Youth), which will be shown at the Grand China Theater, is also the frequently selected movie emperor of this year, young, handsome, and romantic. Since his rise to fame, Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, and Tyrone Power, all known as Hollywood's standard handsome men, have all paled in comparison.</p>
<p>However, many American critics believe that Michel Ronay's acting expressions are indeed welcomed by young girls, but he cannot become the great lover of women. At best, he is just an excellent actor. Michel Ronay himself was unhappy about this and hoped for the future.</p>
<p>But what has recently made the emperor even more troubled is that the doctor has determined that at the age of eighteen, his height has stopped growing. After that, no matter how handsome he is, he will always be a short man less than six feet tall, making it even more difficult to win the love of women. This news, like a thunderbolt, entered his ears.</p>
<p>The emperor's friends, hearing this bad news, went to comfort him. Some metaphorically said: A comedic actor should value maintaining the status quo. Growing taller may not only make him less popular but also make him unsuitable for his current comedic singing roles. It's better to always maintain the image of an "old child star." Some said: When Micky entered Hollywood, he was penniless. Now he has a salary of $400 per week and a bonus of $10,000 per film. He has his own house and car and has even sat on the throne. He can be satisfied. However, the spoiled Michel Ronay still cannot let go.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Idle Talk About Female Martial Arts Actors <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— By Plum Blossom House Master</p>
<p>Female martial arts roles have never been valued, so there is a sigh of lack of talent in this field. Since Yan Lanqiu (Nine Tornadoes) grew old and Zhu Guifang stopped performing, this field has become increasingly declining. Fortunately, Heaven has not abandoned the descendants of female martial arts actors. Yan Shishan and Song Dezhu have risen one after another. Both of them are famous, beautiful, and excel in both voice and artistry. Compared with Lanqiu and Guifang, they are not much inferior, and their popularity and reputation are far above Lanqiu and Guifang. Since the emergence of Little Yan and Dezhu, the field of female martial arts actors will no longer be in danger of being interrupted.</p>
<p>Among the female actors who practice martial arts roles, good talents are even rarer. Those I have seen who are more remarkable are only Xiao Jinling, Fen Juhua, Xi Caifeng, and Jin Shaobao. However, except for Fen Juhua, who is unique in her skills, the rest are not proficient in this art. Juhua is good, but it is a pity that she has bound feet and does not practice stilt walking. If a female martial arts actor does not have stilt walking skills, the beauty of her posture will inevitably be reduced a lot, because stilt walking is one of the necessary conditions for those who practice female martial arts roles.</p>
<p>Bai Shu'an's daughter, Bai Yuyan, is a versatile female actress proficient in both literary and martial roles. Her martial arts skills are even more powerful. Her fight scenes in "Jinshan Temple" are skilled, agile, and extremely varied. Her momentum is like Song Dezhu, her stability is like Yan Shishan, and the dangerous parts almost make people gasp in amazement. This kind of stunt is not only rare among contemporary female actors but also incomparable to anyone in the past in both the North and South opera circles. Some people praise Yuyan as a rare talent, which is certainly not an exaggeration. In addition to her specialties in "Putaohua Shan" (Grape Flower Shirt) and other dramas, Yuyan has recently devoted herself to "Liang Hongyu," "Ying Jielie," "Hua Mulan," "Princess Tie Jing," and the Kun opera "Broken Bridge," aiming upwards and working tirelessly. How can her future be measured?</p>

<p>Tyrone Power is the only popular young actor in Hollywood today, and Dolores del Río is the most beautiful hot girl in Hollywood today. These two big stars have never collaborated before. Movie fans generally hope that they can make an exception and collaborate once to feast their eyes. Now that Dolores del Río has been hired by 20th Century Fox, production giant Darryl Zanuck has invited them to co-star in a hot and exciting film, "Johnny Apollo." The story is about the cause and effect of a college student's fall and how he met a femme fatale in a bandit's lair. Both Tyrone and Dolores have extremely passionate performances.

<h3 id="e114">Open-Air Cinema <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— By Xin Ying</p>
<p>Every summer, open-air cinemas appear as usual. In European and American countries, summer open-air cinemas are also very popular. In our memory, in the past, all amusement parks had open-air cinema sections. However, these open-air cinemas were always on rooftops. People would not go to see them in any season other than summer. Moreover, in these venues, the audience's education level was low, the sounds were very noisy, and the films shown were all very old films, which was a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Recently, in the summer, some people have specifically opened open-air cinemas. Jumping Hall and Xiahui Road have all had them. Last year, the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road had the Cangzhou Open-Air Cinema, and this year, the Luye Open-Air Cinema has appeared on Gordon Road and Dahua Road.</p>
<p>In open-air cinemas, what makes us particularly interested is that a burst of cool breeze blows, making us feel very refreshed. Ordinary cinemas rarely have fans, air conditioning, and other equipment. The natural cool breeze blowing from the grass is enough to make the body and mind feel pleasant.</p>
<p>However, open-air cinemas can only show films at night; they cannot operate during the day. Because they are in open spaces, the sound is not as clear as in cinemas. If it rains, the films cannot be shown. Perhaps mosquitoes will come to bite you on the grass. These are the disadvantages of open-air cinemas!</p>
