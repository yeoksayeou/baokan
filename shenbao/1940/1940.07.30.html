<p>社評</p>
<h3>美蘇和協約進展</h3>
<p>昨夜消息，法屬越南前昨忽然又入緊張狀態。因緣湊合，有四大端：其一，歐洲英德兩國一決雌雄的戰爭，即在目前，影響當然深及各處；一切人，一切國，以此爲爭取利己的重要機會，亦是決戰前夕，決定一切的重要關頭；越南自非例外，當然有其痛切的感應。其二，日本近衛再度上台爲首相，透露其外交方針，據稱方針要點在乎强化其對德義的軸心關係，調整其對美對蘇聯的邦交；如此云云，竟然語不及於對英對法如何：誰都能體認，有其弦外之音，即是威脅英法的有力暗示；英法既爲驚弓之鳥，旣不能觀破日本的虛聲恫嚇，無能爲力，遂不免談虎變色；越南俯仰小由已，宜其緊張。其三，越南方面自對日本屈服，遮斷對華通運之後，日本以所謂「監視委員長」的名義，派駐越南的少將西原，最近與越南法國當局談判到了將近決定的階段，隔昨返日述職；任何談判，當然有意見出入之處；據聞近衛對法國，對越南的具體策略，將以西原的報告爲根據，越南方面由顧念前途運命而惴惴難安。其四，據聞日本向越南當局勒索航空根據地，要求借道，俾由越南進攻中國的雲南；攻雲南，取越南，一石投兩烏，越南當然理會得。</p>
<p>凡右指陳越南方面近日緊張的原由，我們並不以爲這是不測風雲；相反的，確是可以說，自從遠東發生侵略罪案以來，以迄去年歐洲戰爭爆發爲止，其間歲月，除了中國首當其衝，奮志抗戰，遂自己奠定了光明偉大的基礎；此外各國，到了今日，大多身嘗挽救無術的惡果；推原其故，無一不因往年率尙空言，不務實際，長時間的優容了惡因的滋長。慘痛至此，追悔無及，事屬極堪同情、要非意外的不測風云。</p>
<p>凡追悔，輒無及；徒然痛心，却有何益？今日所以猶値得若此指陳者：往者如逝，來者可追！法國如彼，他國應引此爲殷鑒而不復因循，不復優容。即以法國而論、滿望以屈服的禁運，希圖以妥協而緩禍；那知無饜之求，緊緊的跟着，變本加厲而來；以此殷鑒，曉然於旣往的屈服之無益，毅然却繼續的妥協而不爲。法國人士切莫自餒，，以爲實逼處此，諉諸心餘力絀。要知道：降志而屈服，僥倖於妥協，結果還是斷送，終究那得保全！莫謂暫時，莫謂過渡；暫時的委屈，即是永久破碎的過渡。要知道保全越南，惟有不屈不撓，實心實意，維繫中法友誼，期待中國勝利。至於英國所抱態度，、性質上並沒有比法國高，程度上確猶保留着五十步百步之差，覆轍在前，殷鑒不遠！英國若繼續企圖妥協，不妨即在緬甸期待越南目前緊張情况的以次來臨。</p>
<p>力足以倒挽在瀾而迄今無所用其追悔的，惟有美國與蘇聯。今日的美蘇兩國，處境優越，固爲央法今日所望塵莫及；然而不久以前的英法，何嘗遠遜美蘇，亦何嘗想像到過今日的遭遇。敎訓豈必身受切膚之痛，智慧每每增進於旁觀心得；美蘇人士曷不在今日以英法爲鑒戒而想像方來？美蘇今日較英法爲優越，較任何他國爲優越：然謂英法病在往年的因循優容，而美蘇今後不妨繼續養癰養虎而終必無患；若此肯定的樂觀，必爲智慧領域以外的胆識，鄰居失火，凶燄方張，詎得恬然於自己的門庭無恙而冷然坐視？遏火燄，要協力，而今日以前的美蘇却在彼此觀望之中。</p>
<p>何以觀望？或說道小同，，不相爲謀。或說各有隱憂，不遑他顧。或說各秉自信，有恃無恐。或說旣往的隔閡，難於消弭。或說未來的利害，實相矛盾。或說非也，皆非也；眼見他國鬥角鈎心，稱雄爭覇，其事不足訓，其人不可敎，遂不免有圭災樂禍之一念；而彼此勢均力敵，又不免爾詐我虞，蓋誰能最後出塲，誰得最後宰制。因此觀望不前。凡此百家雜說，殆各有觀點；然祗能解說美蘇對歐局，不能解說美蘇對遠東。事關遠東的，莫謂美國或蘇聯，即在英法德義諸國，其實沒有一國乃與遠東侵略者相利害一致。反之，在遠東反侵略，纔是利害一致。英法德義各有所允亟，姑置勿論。而美蘇對於遠東，今日以前的跡近觀望，則除了協力的機運尙未成熟，此外別無理由，別無解說。到了今日，由美國的獨許汽油運往蘇聯，由美蘇商約的緊湊接觸，以此比較美國對別方面的態度，不能不認爲美蘇在諒解的情緒之下，正在促進協力的機運之中。而越南危機的加深，允反映了火燄蔓延，允說明了協力必要。及早成熟，必然是舉世所熱望！</p>
<h3>克萊琪訪松岡會談　英日關係又趨緊張　逮捕英僑係日政策突變結果　英政府已二次向日提出抗議</h3>
<p>東京　日外務省頃宣布、英駐日大使克萊琪與日外相松岡洋右、關於日英關係之談判、頃仍繼續進行、彼此之討論、係於星期六開始、以後或將賡續進行、星期六、克萊琪曾語松岡、謂英國雖力謀增進友誼、而英、日之關係、並未改善、（廿九日合衆電）</p>

<p>倫敦　權威界昨晚消息、英國對於上週杪英僑十名在日本被捕事、將正式向日本提出抗議、關於路透社訪員考克斯上星期六被捕後、復有英僑九名被捕消息、此間昨晚已由東京接到官方之證實、消息靈通人士相信、此種逮捕、將引起天津英租界問題之解決及滇緬公路之協定以後、英。日關係之新緊張、據此間接獲之報告、該英僑十名、同時在日本國內五處被捕、理由未悉、此間相信、此種逮捕係日本新內閣外交政策突變之結果、英國報紙對此事、咸登載於顯著地拉、並指謂此次逮捕事件發生之際、駐東京英大使克萊琪爵士方晤日外相松岡洋右也、英方之報告謂、英大使向松岡申訴、謂渠雖力謀調整英、日之關係、然兩國之關係似反見惡劣、聞英大使嘗指稱、英國之同意封鎖滇　公路、明白宣示英國與日本改進關係之意嚮、克萊琪爵士並提出外間所傳日本新內閣有與羅馬柏林軸心合作之傾向、渠復叩詢因此種外界之傳說、當前之局勢、是否容許英。日依循前此之途徑賡續談判、聞松岡答稱、日本目前之外交政策、正在考慮中、因此渠不能加以答覆、（二十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人須磨今日傍晚發表談話云、鑒於最近外國間諜及陰謀機關之日趨活動、軍事警察已於七月廿七日星期六日、將遍及日本全國之英國閒諜各構成份子、予以拘捕、（二十九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>日方在法租界檢郵　中外均密切注視　乍配林返滬始可解決　郵務行政始終獨立完整</h3>
<p>日方企圖在法租界馬斯南路郵局檢查郵件一事、連日派員赴該局視察辦公地點抄錄信箱租戶姓名、仿繪支局郵區地圖、似已日趨具體化、並盛傳有自八月一日實行之說、茲誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>中外居民　表示　議</p>
<p>法租界內對於日方將派「檢郵員」檢查郵件問題、華人均極端反對、僉認法租界居民向法公董局盡有納稅之義務、日方在法租界內實行檢郵、無異妨害居民之書信自由、故皆切盼法當局應卽予以拒絕、而維護居民應享之權益、又法租界境內之外僑、如英美等各國居民、亦一致表示反對、因郵件之被檢、固不僅華人遭受妨害權益也、現英美等各國外交當局、亦甚注意此事件之發展、</p>
<p>法總領事　拒不發言</p>

<p>乍配林氏　返滬有期</p>
<p>王氏又稱、日方檢查法租界郵件、事前確曾與郵局作數度接洽、唯另有負資人、八月一日實行之說、未有聞及、查法租界共有五支局、馬斯南路、徐家匯、康悌路、天主堂街、四局、爲「投遞支局」、馬斯南路因與愷自邇路於前次作「合併投遞」、故該局範圍較廣、約有信差百餘人、凡「投遞支局」如在該局區域內投遞之本埠信件、母須經總局轉遞、可直接遞送、至信箱設置、除總局外、馬斯南路有恒路兩支局特准設置、最近愚園路支局、亦將設置信箱、至乍配林局長本定昨日到滬、因在香港遇風、所乘之裕生輪、方自昨日離港、故准定八月一日到埠、乍氏抵滬後、將劉檢郵事、有所決定、</p>
<p>政治敘述　希望避免</p>
<p>王氏最後以懇切之態度對記者稱、設法租界檢查實行、竭誠希望社會人士、書寫信件時、避免一切政治上之叙述或討論、則必可避免一切無謂之損失、因上海爲一複雜之國際部市、自應採取一切愼重之態度、解除本身一切不必要之麻煩也、又據另一消息、法租界當局對此事、亦正密切加以注視、商討應付辦法、</p>
<p>日人昨又　前往佈置</p>
<p>自上星期六日人四名前往馬斯南路郵局視察後、昨日下午一時許、該四日人又赴該局抄錄該局所有圖表文件、並視察郵件管理之手續等、昨日彼等雖暫假室外長桌工作、但正式辦公地點、似已進行佈置、該四日人至下午五時始行離去、據該局負資人告記者稱、關於檢查郵件事、現已達僅待總局訓令之地步、其辦公室之佈置、及檢查郵件之種種手續上問題。一俟總局訓令到達、卽可迅速辦理、又據可靠方面表示，該四日人檢視該局、雖未言其目的、但信彼等係進行準備工作、俾將來正式檢郵時、對種種手續、得以純熟、現開始檢郵日期雖未確定、但觀乎日人已赴該局工作、則其實施日期、似屬不遠矣、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米又到五萬包　米價上落兩三元</h3>
<p>昨晨開市、現洋米更起劇烈跌風、作客靜觀、一無進取、客販及浮戶手貨謀脫、一路直瀉、任你喊破喉嚨、作客充耳不聞、迄中市尙無成交、火絞已祗喊四十七八元、二號尖四十四五元、方見本鄕店舖乘廉出手、一般空頭繼起補空、形勢反復轉緊、各貨行情易跌亦易升、倐忽之間回昂二元左右、迨收盤一號陳西貢又至五十一元、新五十元、二號陳尖四十七元半、四十七元、新四十六元、火絞尖五十元、</p>
<p>洋米昨日初跌後漲、高低有三四元出入、早市承日前疲風、現路各米一致下跌、現米曾小去二元不等、後以貨主不忍賤脫、而本客實銷與新囤頗有趁機吸收、行情立卽回復原狀、午收反有喊高之舉、回籠路貨原包因大部已經到齊、爲銀根關係、早市跌風極猛、二號暹米現貨原包開價卽至五十四元半、新到已報　口者降開五十四元、比之上週六較小二元及二元半、而新到或將到之米報進口之回籠原包開價亦至五十五元、較週六小一元半、價小後大戶行號即不忍再度虧脫、而獲利本頭與新起浮多頗有趁機收補、市塲空氣竟轉變、隨在買聲中級級回漲、報進口者大至四十七元、比上週六反大半元、可轉口者大至四十八元則較大一元半、比之早晨低價則均回好三元、但買方均非實消、後市尙無樂觀也、</p>
<p>洋米又有大批到滬、渣華公司芝比沙號輪赴西貢裝米、已於前日（星期六）傍晚八時許返滬、計裝來洋米四千噸、均四萬一千餘包、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭、昨日起開始起卸、又昨日怡和洋行永生輪抵埠、亦由香港裝來洋米九千三百四十包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、聞尙有大批在後續來、（祖）</p>
<p>粳糯國米、到貨雖仍有限、但當洋米暴落之際、傳聞塲外暗盤、貨主旣無扳守之意、均以速脫爲是、作客知勢難挽回、悉抱得過且過之旨、致喊聲曾落四五元之鉅、後隨洋米亦稍回緊、但售價均已貶短多多、常幫鮮特粳僅六十三四元、蘇崑常州白粳六十元左右、次至宿五十五六元、靑泗薄稻六十一二元、南港斛早五十五六元、糯米溧陽貨五十八元、常州貨五十六七元、香港五十六元至五十四元云云、</p>
<h3>粉價再低五角</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨二號粉廠盤、由十五元五角改爲十五元、比前再低五角、因連日本街銷化淸淡、客銷又見沉靜、更兼米價大落、人心莫不看小、日廠粉以收麥價廉、價已貶跌在前、華粉備受傾軋、至此亦非跌不可、統市福阜各廠直接批出者、增至五千包以上、日粉與內地粉因已一再貶跌、木客方面、尙思抑小而取、貨方則售意反堅、致買賣雙方、幾呈擯持狀態、聞鳳風粉祗售十三元六七角、但亦無正式之成交云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市新小麥交易、依然淸閑、虹口來源、日見衆多、聞內地存麥亦將大批運滬、惟此事尙在設法中、執貨者受環境之壓迫、莫不忍痛貶售、聞華廠方面、每日可收二三千包、價在二十元左右、日廠進價已不滿十八元、相差終須二元以上也、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯供求　足以相抵</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、仍在步緊中、乃華行及投機商扒結不衰、供求略差、價遂微軟、本日晨開頗平、嗣經洋行首先有洋米結款、再以匯豐華行等吃胃濃厚、故美匯卽達六元〇六二五、又曾做開遠期九月份美匯退至六元關內、爲五元九六八七五、後市狀極呆定、罕聞談論交易、故晚收與午收全同、英金三辦八七五、美匯六元〇六二五、期貨亦然、</p>
<p>洋米仍有結款</p>
<p>晨初以匯兌英對美不動對滬亦平、美對英跌二分、對滬平定、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美匯六元〇九三七五、較之上週六收、英美兩匯俱平、開後市面平靜、外行華商首先塞予匯豐本月份美匯六元〇九三七五、嗣華銀行亦吃進外行同月美匯六元〇九三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿更、白銀平衡稅揭曉並無增减、此後洋行忽有需要、並有洋米結款向美行結進、本月份美匯軟爲六元〇六二五、而同時華行及匯豐吸入美行同月美匯均告六元〇六二五、且華商投機家亦購買遠月美匯、計有利匯豐等相互售予投機商九月份美匯五元九六八七五、迨至午刻、買賣尙稱平衡、未見變化、結果英金三辦士八七五、美匯六元〇六二五、比晨開英緊〇一五六二五、美縮〇三一二五、期貨均軟、</p>
<p>午後交易稀少</p>
<p>午後市面始終呆定、鮮聞交易做開、英美兩匯、期現價格悉與午收相同、英金三辦士八七五、美匯六元〇六二五、八月份英金三辦士八五九三七五、美滙六元、較上週未收、美滙期現各緊〇三一二五、英金俱軟〇一五六二五、</p>
<p>香港匯市平靜</p>
<p>香港二十九日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤平、靜英日及申匯現貨、仍無榮辱、美滙現貨緊〇六二五、爲廿三元四三七五、九時四十分告平、美滙現貨續緊〇六二五、爲二十三元三七五、十時四十五分告平、美滙現貨回鬆〇六二五、爲二十三元四三七五、申滙現貨升一元半、爲三百八十四元、十一時三十分告平、各滙概無上落、午收申滙現貨回降一元、爲三百八十三元、下午二時三十分開盤平靜、各滙概無變動、</p>
<p>天津英匯略鬆</p>
<p>天津二十九日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英滙現貨鬆〇三一二五、爲三便士六二五、美滙現貨仍站五元六八七五、申匯現貨升半元、爲一百〇七元半、「聯鈔」暗盤賤二角半、爲九十三元七角五分、</p>
<h3>散漫的買風中　金市向高峯進</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、承上週末之堅勢、繼續盤旋於五千四百元左右、乃因新多購買、頗爲踴躍、見高賣出者多屬無力之夥、故價有再向高峯挺升之樣、晨初卽好二十三元、爲五千三百五十五元、開盤一時銀號卽來撈進、漲達五千四百二十元高價、雖因金號錢兌業居間塞出、略低數十元、終以銀號力扒、不遺餘力、午收尙有五千三百八十二元、後市爲狀稍靜、惟價極穩、開盤後最高爲五千三百九十二元、嗣爲　兌業吐出所撳、會跌至五千三百七十八元、而收盤則告五千三百八十三元、結果較上週六軋升五十一元、全日交易尙旺、約三千兩、銀樓飾金終則無更動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤好五十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以報載財部有發行新公債之說、開時人心頗佳、一抬卽高二十三元、首由金號出銀號十兩、爲五千三百五十五元、嗣後匯市報軟、買風更濃、銀號幫暨金號爭先搶買、不久竟再漲六十五元、銀樓業進銀號等數十兩、爲五千四百二十元、旋滙市回硬、散多乘高吐賣、且某錢兌業亦來傾吐、未幾竟同落五十元、銀號出綫兌業五十兩、退爲五千三百七十元、後以外滙重告緊軟、買風再起、證券幫及銀號先後搜入、復見升至五千三百九十五元、收盤前卒因浮多出籠、且買戶减少、　再告回落十三元、金號對做二十兩、爲五千三百八十二元作午收價、午後開市略高、錢兌業進金號十兩、爲五千三百九十元、繼又漲起二元、銀號進金號三十兩、爲五千三百九十二元、嗣後錢兌業突來力售、略向下挫、金號出銀號三十兩、爲五千三百七十八元、入後銀號幫重來吸收、抬起五元、證券幫進銀號二十兩、爲五千三百八十三元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲五十一元、收後需求者頗旺、又抬至五千三百九十元、且尙無賣者、全天六十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金减低五十餘元、均鮮像開、</p>
<p>飾金高後又回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百五十元、迨十時掛大十元、十一時回落十元、此後無變化、計大同行依舊懸五百五十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣繼續上升</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤終漲五十元外、英美金鎊因亦各升一元、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票以黑市美匯結緊、度高至十六元五角六分、卒爲十六元四角半、比上週六軋漲五分、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲、新加坡及安南·羅比·坎拿大票等均不乏需要、市價一致挺漲、日金票需要又殷、晚市高至一元二角三分二厘、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍爲一元零八分、</p>
<h3>金融述評　續昨</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瑍</p>
<p>七月二十七日止</p>
<p>以一九四〇年上半年的統計來說，輸出總額是一，〇一八百萬元，可是內中輸往日元集團的數量要佔到百分之六十，輸入總額是一，八五六百萬元，但是自第三國的輸入要佔到百分之七十以上。因之名義上出超一六二百萬日元，較之一九三九年同期增加一三六百萬日元，實際上對第三國的貿易是表示一種很大的人超，計五〇三百萬日元，較之　九三九年同　是增加七千六百萬日元，這種人超勢必須以外匯去支付的。而對日元集團約六萬七千萬日元的出超，它所得的是日元集團貨幣，而不楚可用以購買軍需原料的外匯。茲將這半年來的日本貿易情况分析如次（數値的單位千日元）：</p>
<h3>貼現回小二元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、略見回落、每千元上午貼進步做小至四十七元、貼出亦由五十元强做低至四十九元、下午仍在四十八元左右、比上週六軋小二元、錢業公會息、早午兩市仍</p>
<h3>證劵　戊種特別興奮</h3>
<p>證券暗繫、昨日市况頗有變動、大體仍係上漲、獨戊種爲各幫特別垂靑、需要極殷、午前行市直綫冉冉上騰、午收價竟猛漲一元許、向來極堅俏之甲種、忽退居於冷落地位、竟完全未有上落、丙種亦祗微好一角而已、向來戊種比丙種略小四五角者、昨忽改爲丙比戊小五角、因此午後引起互相掉換交易、使市價稍稍軋近、丁種市價比任何各種爲賤、故收買者亦極踴躍、午前仁昌搜購甚猛、德孚公茂久豐聯益亦踴躍參加、賣方以怡泰爲多、胡鶴記鴻大潤利同康亦有吐出、但戊種供出者極少、因補空之激烈、猛漲九角五分之多、午後戊種仍有收買、如公茂仁昌久豐仍有需要、幸永祥恒孚聯和及三十八號均有戊種賣出、大都換進丙種、六十四號賣出甲種、鴻大厚大吐出丙種、散戶收進丁種、市價丙戊種略鬆、其餘均堅、丁種獨强、今日爲連利息最後一日、或將稍起回風，一日市况結果、一致繼續趨堅、好起五分一角至六角半不等、成交總數、共計約一百三十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價爲法幣六十四元半、除息價、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、晨初開盤、甚形激昂後因賣氣旺盛、漲風略被抑制、吾則市况堅强程度、當不止此、各股在回跌時、買戶亦相當衆多、潛勢極佳、上海銀公司頃宣佈發中期息元、未免令人失望、橡皮股比較引人注意、</p>
<h3>紗花　單紗南銷活動　雙馬近千元關</h3>
<p>紗市堅定、漲風復起、此因華南方面實需較爲活動些、辦三二支單紗為多數、所以人心激昂一步、但一般投機商靜默已久、鑒於環境稍形好轉、拉提做作之舉特盛、大家略爲吸收幾包、於是檀面一緊、漲力則强也、實則手中大家有貨、希望能升最樂、前程如多頭獲利一鬆、深恐反動允劇也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、承上日堅昂之餘氣續進、場面上喊高抬好者爲夥、二十支雙馬價爲九百七十元、然某大戶多頭獲利吐出一部份、又復回跌至九百八十元、在八十二三元之間盤旋甚久、但客幫實際交易並不起色，又見平安、收盤價爲九百八十五元、查牛日間成交統計二千二百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十九元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如列、同行一、八九香港三〇五統計二、二〇五</p>
<p>內地　三〇廈門　一〇</p>
<h3>棉花廠辦仍缺</h3>
<p>現棉交易稍形活絡、但巨　交易、尚屬缺乏、日廠購買之棉、均係遲一個月付款、惟紗市銷路雖滯、然投機買者活動而升、對於原糾採辦仍鮮也、所以棉市行情平、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况疲乏、因缺乏重要之買戶及棉區氣候報告良好、及一部份之倒限價賣出、結果內盤價格較之上日跌四五磅音、印度棉市昨日速同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見靜寂、廠方進胃亦稀、紗價轉好、此確乃良好之現象也、日方廠商沉默、同業略有交易、惟爲數極微耳、</p>
<h3>疋頭　各方趁廉吸收　售價大都上漲</h3>
<p>國布　銷路續佳、蓋以紗價連漲、人心向昂、各方趁廉均有吸納、市氣稍轉活潑、售盤亦增、粗細布斜紋每疋漲一角至五角、漂染布漲二角半至五角、本街批發號染廠需要獨旺成交一千五百餘件、以粗布及染坯布居多、粵港帮辦斜紋色布色斜二百餘件、問帮辦色布色斜漂布近百件、國外新加坡暹邏辦去漂染布三千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　先漲後平、結果中檔細布及細斜每疋提升二角五分至五角、高檔龍頭細布新棧單一度漲至三十元、旋以漲勢過暴、後市回降至二十九元三角半收盤、四君子嗶嘰每碼由八角八分回至八角七分半、但市氣仍堅挺、蓋因木街銷納殊旺故也、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭二百件、運往天津、</p>
<h3>油餅　銷路尚佳　價均轉好</h3>
<p>昨日油餅市况、一般人心承上週末之好轉、故趨勢一致續升、維油市在收盤時見呈軟化、但結果出者少、共成交膠州現生油一百件、價詳市價欄、路貨三百件、烟台生油一百件、又　號生油五百　、青島生油一百五十桶、大連豆油八十桶、　　豆油五十件、浦東　油二十攝、大有廠油五十担、豆餅在原料黃豆有漲無跌之潛勢下、火局有良佳態度、故各方心思又告活絡、但景非時遷、交易不湧、祇由廈門帮辦去大有四牌　六千片、價爲十一元九角半、內地等問津甡記餅一千片、價爲十元另六角半至七角、肥字餅一車、價爲十元另五角、靑中餅三千片、價爲九元三角至五角云、</p>
<p>又昨日有桐油三百聽、由天津裝來、又椰油一千四百噸、由西貢來滬、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖升降互見</h3>
<p>昨糖市粗白見緊、而車白微鬆、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白本棧六十六元、較前日後盤升七角、外棧六十六元二角至六十六元、轉口貨略升、卽打棧單者五十元〇七角至六角、八月十五日交貨由五十一元至五十一元二三角、太古車白微鬆、B嘜爲七十二元半、H嘜車赤五十五元半、升三角、荷赤六十元、本廠雪白仍六十六元半、一號冰八十七元、晶明冰八十八元半、均小五角、國糖近以走化較狹、致乏續開、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紅綠茶微有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、抽芯普通珍眉綠茶、歐銷依然停滯、僅德美兩莊、對於土莊紅茶及蝦目綠茶、略有零星走銷、全市共由錦隆興成孖士門等行、買進紅綠茶二百餘箱、紅茶售價二百八十五元、珠茶售價自二百六十五元至二百九十元、市盤均趨站定、此外鳳眉一項、美莊行家、　巴　電　　、　　會有活動之望云、</p>
<h3>出口生絲　全年近五萬擔</h3>
<p>據一海紡業界之　＃、自去年六月一日、　本年五月三十日止、一足年間上海生絲之輸出、總絲計四萬九千九百六十擔、其中銷往美國方面者爲最多、、約占總額百分之六十、</p>
<p>歐州方面自去年九月麗　戰事以來、英法在遠東之各洋行、進胃驟形稀少、蓋國外人心不安、有以致之、待歐戰大規模發生、英法洋行更見冷淡、而呈停頓狀態、故輸出額日見减少、內由達昌洋行經手輸出者、計九千九百七十擔、約占總額百分之十九·五五、</p>
<p>其次由怡和洋行輸出者、計九千三百八十五擔、占總額百分之十八·七九、其他洋行共輸出八百五十八擔、僅占總額百分之一·七二、目下滬上之各洋行、一部份已改變方針、在滬吸進之廠絲、已改售美莊矣、（翔）</p>
<h3>五金　大口鐵貨價堅</h3>
<p>現市上流通貨最感單薄之大馬口鐵、查海外無現貨裝來、加之遠期定貨、亦未見做開、故現時略能應市者、祇靠微數而已所以執貨之同業心思居奇、行情始終未見下挫、雖本街滾筒作鎖廠機器廠以及紗廠家等納胃滯呆、香港天津等帮　商生意亦全無、然市塲人心依然寄昂、交易多以張數作準、進出售價亦以每張計算、躉箱生意貿賣·兩方均極鮮聞、　市如二十四　每　沽三十二元（二十六號花色則售十六元左右、</p>

<p>神仙辨誣</p>
<p>仙之源出於道教，而道教所傳，無非虛無杳渺之事。老子曰：「吾無大患，惟患有身。」己之身尚且患有，又豈肯濟人之身，而累己之身乎。故真仙度世之事，屢見於裨官野史，愚者信之，智者疑焉。至於以符水治病，此則尤為惑人之術，並非言仙者所屑為，而江浙此風最盛。吳越素尙鬼神，燒香念佛拜斗求仙之事，幾於無地無之，隨處有廟，隨處卽有香火，而香灰醫病，名曰仙丹，鄕村老嫗，信而敬之，翕如也。曰關魂，越中呼為關肚仙，人有問之者，必請靈姑招其家亡故之靈詢之，無知之輩，有認以為真而泣數行下者，其實則呱呱之聲，皆偽為也。湖郡有一曹孝子廟，由某老嫗侍奉香火，居住其中，忽傳有活佛下降，能以香灰治人疾病，求之者紛紛不絕，官聞而欲禁，則格於鄕紳之言，嗣後恐其惑眾滋事，卒飭役毀其像而焚之，靈遂寂然，亦無他禍。去歲寗波有於橋邊建造土地祠以歛香金者，地方官聞之，拆其祠而收沒其錢，聞者快也。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>人之初，性不善</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>有人說人性本善，也有人以爲人性本惡；可是根據心理學上說來，我以爲應該說人性不善，才比較恰當一點，比較近於眞理。</p>
<p>一個嬰孩出世以後，祇知有已，不知其他，拿自己做世界的中心，實際上是一個自私自利的小動物；後來長大起來，才遂漸知道有媽媽，有爸爸，有奶娘，有兄姊弟妹，有親戚朋友，於是乎一步步從自私自利而養成一種顧念別人的習慣，最後才演進爲利他的性格。自私自利是一個人性格的起點，而利他是一個人性格發展的最高峯。</p>
<p>每個人性格發展的過程，各不相同。有些人從出世以後，不曾有所進步，永遠是一個自私自利的小傢伙；有些人是稍有進步了，可是却不曾充份地發展到利他的境地；還有一部份情緒成熟的常態的人，個性才發展到登峯造極的利他地步。</p>
<p>所以，一個人性格的發展，事實上是由自利而到利他的。自私固然不好，可是不能說是「惡」，還是說「不善」比較恰當一點。</p>
<p>因此，我說：「人之初，性不善。」</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>文章的動靜</h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>文章的風格一向認爲只可以意會，不可以言傳的，可是根據最近心理學家的報告，文章風格也可以用科學方法來研究，而且所得到的成績，相當令人滿意。</p>
<p>心理學家都以爲風格大別可分二種，一種是動派，一種是靜派。凡是文章中用動詞較多的，便算是『動派』作風，寫這一類文章的人的個性一定是好動，活躍，而且情感容易衝動。反之，凡是文章中用靜詞（名詞及形容詞）較多的，作風便是『靜派』，有這種作風的人比較安靜，多思考，而且也比較的成熟。</p>
<p>這不過是大概的說法而已，究竟「動派』『靜派』怎樣區別呢？美國劉易士理工學院心理學系主任鮑特博士（Dr．David　Pablo　Boder）最近發明了一種『動靜商數』（Adjetiuee－Verb　Quotientor　A．V．Q．）的辦法，用這種辦法便可準確的用數字表示一篇文章是動派，還是靜派了。</p>
<p>所謂『動靜商數』的測定，並不難，只要拿一篇文章來數它的動詞和形容詞，其中形容詞的數目和動詞數目的比較便是『動靜商數』。譬如某文章的動靜商數是五十，那便表示這篇文章每用一百個動詞，便要用五十個形容詞。</p>
<p>鮑特博士用這個方法去研究各式各樣的文章，發現了許多有趣的事實：</p>
<p>劇本用形容詞頂少，商數平均只有十一。法律二十。小說二十五。科學著作七十五。形容詞愈少，閱讀起來愈方便，所以科學家實在是很不替讀者打算的。</p>
<p>商業信件的平均動靜商數是十九，沒有受過文學訓練的人所寫的私人信是二十二。詩歌恰合中庸之道，平均的商數是三十六。廣告作家最喜堆砌字眼，動靜夠數是七十八；可是他還不及哲學博士，平均一篇博士論文裏面的形容詞要算頂多了，竟達八十八之多！</p>
<p>文章的動靜商數比談話來得大，因爲寫文章的時候，總要多花些推敲的工夫。</p>
<p>動靜商數也受年齡的影響，其間如何關係，鮑特博士還沒有定論。譬如文學家愛默生記了五十多年的日記，據鮑博士的研究，他在年輕的時候比老年時候喜歡多用形容詞，前者是五十九，後者是三十七。哲學家威廉詹姆士在四十多歲的時候，寫給女人的信裏面的形容詞比寫給男人的信多，可是到了他六十多歲的時候，恰恰一個相反——寫給男人信中形容詞比較多了。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>三種縱隊</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>二次歐戰發生以來，報章刊物上，發現了不少新名詞。其中最習見的是泛指一切內奸的『第五縱隊』。這次歐戰爆發，德國人儘量的利用『第五縱隊』，在比利時荷蘭丹麥挪威各小國擾亂，用迅雷不及掩耳的手段，佔據了各該國。卽以法國的失敗乞和而論，並非兵力的不勝，英國政治家都認爲是『第五縱隊』在法國活動的結果。</p>
<p>「第五縱隊」旣有如此恐怖的破壞力量，世界各中立國不禁都惶惶然起來，便想到利用縱隊以抵制縱隊的方法。加之，德國對南美洲早抱有野心，對於美國的袒護民治各國尤其嫉視，美國爲未雨綢繆，防制攻擊起見，卽產生了「第六縱隊」。第六縱隊最先發現於費城，當地的警醫總監凱根博士首先發起，主張召集退伍士兵和消防人員，組織特種團體，號爲「第六縱隊」，專門以殲滅「第五縱隊」，維護本國利益爲職志。這種團體由退職的海陸空軍軍官加以督察，富有軍事的紀律，一俟美國陸軍部和國會贊可之後，第六縱隊便將普及全國。</p>
<p>和美國「第六縱隊」相仿的，英國也有防止間諜活動的團體，名曰「靜默縱隊」（Silence　Column）它的職務也在謹防敵人宣傳的活動，由靑年幹練人員組織而成，但最近因它活動範圍不大，暫時停辦，而將擴大爲積極的縱隊。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>無後</h3>
<p>— 錢美璋</p>
<p>「不孝有三，無後爲大」。這兩句話，我想誰都能够瞭解，是說沒有兒子斷了祖宗血統是不孝的意思。國人重嗣續觀念，在獎勵生育加强民族上講，是値得稱頌的。但徒知增加人口，而不謀善良敎育，斷不能在此生存競爭時代與人相角逐。</p>
<p>我以爲「無後」兩字的解釋，決不是如此簡單。偶與友人談及，友之見解，較爲高超，他說：對子女沒有敎育，稱「無後」。徒有子女，不能培植使爲有用之材，何有於「孝」，何貴於「有後」？其不辱及祖宗者幾希？</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　　幾種推想</p>
<p>霍桑道：「我想先去瞧瞧我的委託人姜安娜，把我們所知道的事實證實一下。你旣然懷疑着那余甘棠，不妨先去瞧瞧他。」</p>
<p>倪金壽點點頭道：「好，他在江南大學裏讀書，我想總容易找。」</p>
<p>「還有一點，你可以查一查夜裏派在這裏守崗的是誰，關於那輛老毛瞧見的黑色汽車和這裏進出的人，也許可以有些情報。」</p>
<p>倪金壽答應了，便走出客室去，和那樓上的李芝範談了一回，才回進會客室來。接着霍桑將鐵箱和書桌抽屜鎖好，把鑰匙都交給了倪金壽。我們走出王家大門時，我見那個九十號警士還站在那裏。霍桑叫倪金壽把這警士撤去，又問那警士剛才屍體抬出來時，曾吾有一個少年揭開覆屍的單被的事。</p>
<p>那警士說：「有的，剛才眞有一個穿西裝的傢伙，站在載屍汽車的面前。我以爲他是瞧閙熱的閒人，不很注意。不過我不曾看見他把單被揭開來。」</p>
<p>霍桑不再多問，便向倪金壽附耳說了幾句，又彼此的定如果有什麼發展的消息，互相通告。當我們上汽車的時候，倪金壽同了那九十九號警士也走到大同路方面上車去。</p>
<p>霍桑坐在駕駛盤前把汽車開動以後，態度很沉默，好像凝神一志的模樣。他的駕駛相當熟練，從前他也曾在內地經歷過險峻盤旋的山路，並不曾出過什麼岔子。此刻他在平坦光滑的馬路上駛行，而且路上的車輛也不怎樣擁擠，似乎不需要這樣子緊張。我料想他的神思顯然仍集中在這件疑案上面。我把車窗旋開了，吸受了些給陽光蒸濾過的新鮮空氣。因爲在那慘怖的屍體旁邊　留了兩個多鐘頭，又加上這複雜糾紛的案情，我的腦子也有些昏沉沉了。</p>
<p>一回，我問道：「我們去看姜安娜嗎？」霍桑點點頭，並不答話。</p>
<p>「你知道伊的住所嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，伊說在康寗公庽三〇六號。」他說完了這簡單的答話，又靜默無言。</p>
<p>我總覺得有些不耐，隔了一回，又禁不住發問：「你見了安娜打算要證實那幾個問題？」</p>
<p>霍桑仍作簡語道：「問題很多。」</p>
<p>我仍企圖逗開他的話盒。「那四個男子的切實的關係，當然是你要調查的主題。對不對？」</p>
<p>「對，可是還有其他。」</p>
<p>「什麼？請舉一個例。」　（六十）</p>

<h3>古裝片置景的重要性</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>大家所期待着的金星公司，據說已決定攝製的處女作是舒適與顧蘭君合演的「李香君」，這當然仍是一張古裝片。但我們並不因爲她是古裝片而感到失望，在意識正確的條件下，古裝片還是値得我們歡迎。</p>
<p>過去古裝片大都粗製濫造，已無可諱言矣！而所謂民間故事影片者，以五六天與十多天的短促時間，竟可以攝製出一張必須經過長時間的考證與籌備的影片來，這在世界銀壇是創見，而且也許是後無來者？因此，它的內容如何，成績如何，也就可想而知，在古裝片中占重要地位的置景，那允其是不堪聞問的了！</p>
<p>西席地密雨當預備攝製歷史片「傾國傾城」以前，以他那樣卓越的天才，豐富的經騐，似乎該已綽有餘裕了。然而他是怎樣的審愼呢？僅以置景一項而言，他在派拉蒙公司的研究部與其他各種圖書館中收集了大批史籍，更翻閱了個人的藏書一百多種，以研究古代羅馬和埃及的種種禮貌，風俗，服飾，建築，以及戰具，用器，和珠寳等等，他以爲製景，在一張影片中的地位，其重要並不亞於全片每一個演員，而古裝片尤其不能忽視了這一點。</p>
<p>他說：「在劇中假如要描繪西撒下令或送信，你應該用那一種東西來寫令和信？又如要表演一個女僕需要消遣時，你可是用鋼琴？但那時紙料和鋼琴還沒有製造呢」！因此，他爲了要像眞起見，無論占據劇中絕渺小的，畫面，卽僅僅一支髮針，他也得與歷史家，博古家，畫家，電影劇作家等，作不厭求詳約商榷和探索。這樣，他每天從早上九時起，至每晚十一時止，經過八個多月周詳的預備，才把劇本演員置景種種處理完竣，於是才敢開始攝製。</p>
<p>這裏，我們可以看出置景於古裝片的重要性，它不僅爲了點綴美觀，同時甚至於竟可決定全片的命運。在事實上，我們固然做不到西席地密爾那樣認眞，但牛頭不對馬嘴，使人瞧了祇是不順眼，或者因陋就簡，將錯就錯，是決定不會得到成功的。所以我要求攝製者對於上述加以考慮。同時也希望其他攝製古裝片者審愼將事才行。</p>

<h3>怎樣拍攝電影？　（一）</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>電影的產生史，還不十分久長，但是因為科學家們繼續不停的研究和發明，因此電影便一天比一天進步；無聲片有聲片五彩片甚至不久的將來行將實現的立體片等，一一接蹤而來。電影現已成爲大衆娛樂的重要工具，可以說在普通人的生活原理，電影的拍攝方法等，許多人都還感覺很糢糊，作者願將拍攝電影的大概，作一個簡略的概述，貢獻給對於本問題有興趣的讀者們。</p>
<p>（一）攝影長的剖視　攝製影片，第一須有一間很大的攝影場長闊都在數百公尺以上的由鋼架和玻璃搭成，在這攝影場裏，可憑技巧和佈景佈置成客廳，房屋，或高山，大海等一應片中所需的情景。攝影塲的地板，都堅固非凡，使可讓數百或甚至數千的演員站立上面或成羣的牛羊，笨重的車輛等絡繹往返不至塌毀，在攝影塲的旁邊大都安置着演員的休息室，化妝室，佈置室，木匠間等，也都佔着很大的面積。</p>
<p>（二）光的來源攝製影片如同拍照相一樣需要極大的光亮。光的來源可利用屋頂玻璃窗上透進的陽光，不過在普通拍片時，大多還是用人造光，因爲人造光的强度可自由變動，指揮容易，供給人造光的器械有兩種：第一是弧光燈，第二是水銀燈，這兩種燈都能發極强的光亮。弧光燈的裝置，有的是集合數個單位的弧光燈，安置至一架四輪車上，有的像探照燈的式樣裝在一座能移動的鋼架上，在拍攝大塲面的片子時，有時竟須用三四十座弧光燈，每座的光强爲五百安倍，光亮達一萬支燭光，在如此强的燈光下工作，演員的目光當然很易受損傷，爲求免除起見，通常在燈的前面置有一塊鉛質的玻璃，功效能吸收損目的紫外綫水銀燈的光亮，雖也極强，但是郤很柔和，不害目，並且較弧光燈爲經濟。這種燈若用在普通家庭內也可，不過有一點缺憾，就是在水銀燈光下，人的面目皮膚現灰白色，不甚佳妙，但是對於拍攝電影，這是毫無妨礙的。</p>
<h3>「黑天堂」觀後</h3>
<p>— 沙</p>
<p>「黑天堂」是吳村繼一新地獄」後又一以現社會爲背景的作品，寫一個天眞未鑿的少女，因不甘心把自己的前途埋葬在這萬惡的社會，竟毅然的離開了她姊姊去過流浪生涯。在這裏襯出了所謂「黑天堂」的孤島上的形形色色。周璇飾一流浪街頭的少女，可說是最適合她的個性。藍蘭客串一個受虛榮引誘而終於喪生的舞女，頗為補職。　稼農這次也不失其老練的本色，餘均平平而已。</p>
<p>「黑天堂」沒有「新地獄」輕鬆而富於諷刺的塲面，能使觀衆在一陣在笑之後劃過一條淚痕，相反的有幾處却嫌太做作了，如秀麗不認識玻璃櫉窗而想用手去攫取櫥窗內的食物的鏡頭是。</p>
<p>或許是日子的匆促吧，剪接上很見凌亂，有幾處的光綫也很不清楚，最後用老襲跳黃浦來結束，我以為很不妥當，按老龔是迷途知反的人物，他也認爲上海是「黑天堂」不能再逗留下去了，那麼導演爲什麼不給他一個積極而光明的前途，而偏偏要他消極的自殺呢？</p>
<p>姚莉近來在電台上很見走紅，這次由周璇介紹而客串唱了一曲歌，幾個面部的特寫鏡頭很不差，可惜她沒有戲演。</p>
<p>總之「黑天堂」是一部較有意識値得一看的片子，最後我希望導演和監制人，不要一味在生意眼的民間片上轉念頭，爲中國電影界的前途計，能多攝一點比「黑天堂」「新地獄」更有意義的影片。</p>

<h3>Quick Actions of the Chinese Army in Hubei - Entering the Japanese Lines at Pengjiawan - Jiuling and Other Places Across the River from Yichang Also Breached - Japanese Forces in Southern Guangxi Heavily Obstructed at Various Routes to Li Jun</h3>
<p>Fancheng - The Chinese army in Hubei, with lightning-fast action, on the evening of the 27th, taking advantage of the heavy clouds, attacked the Japanese troops entrenched at Pengjiawan, mustered their courage, and charged into the stronghold in one fell swoop, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, with blood splattering everywhere. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese were killed, and two light and heavy machine guns, more than 100 rifles, more than 30 steel helmets, and many other military supplies were seized. Until dawn on the 28th, the battle was still ongoing. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Southern Guangxi Front - Since the 22nd, the Japanese troops entrenched in the Funan area have been shelling the Chinese positions from time to time. At 5:00 AM on the 24th, a vanguard unit of the Japanese troops attempted to attack Huali from Zhonghe Ferry in Zhuang, southwest of Fucheng, but was met with a fierce counterattack by the Chinese and retreated immediately. On the 26th, fresh Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on the Chinese positions from Funan, Suilu, and Xichangxu, and a unit advanced to the vicinity of Quli at Shenshi (3-5 PM) on the same day, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese.

Both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Hankou - When the Chinese army withdrew from Yichang recently, it implemented a scorched earth policy, causing the rice stored there to be destroyed by fire. According to a reliable foreign source in the area, "The Chinese here have no rice to buy, please make every effort to provide relief. The weather is hot, and there is no food, causing the poor to suffer unspeakably. However, all foreigners are safe." It is reported that some foreigners here are now cooperating with the Japanese, planning to transport rice to Yichang. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>Intense Battle in the Suburbs of Qinyang - Japanese Army Depot Hit and Caught Fire - Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Defeated Individually</h3>

<h3>Progress in American and Soviet Harmony</h3>
<p>Last night's news indicated that French Indochina suddenly became tense again the day before yesterday. There are four main reasons for this confluence of events: First, the war between England and Germany in Europe, which will decide who is superior, is imminent. Its impact will naturally extend to all places. Everyone and every country is using this as an important opportunity to seize benefits for themselves, and it is also a crucial juncture before the decisive battle to determine everything. Indochina is no exception, and naturally has a painful reaction. Second, Japan's Konoe returned to power as Prime Minister for the second time, revealing his diplomatic policy. It is said that the key points of the policy lie in strengthening its Axis relationship with Germany and Italy, and adjusting its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. However, he did not mention how to deal with England and France. Everyone can understand that there is an unstated meaning, which is a strong hint of threat to England and France. England and France are already frightened birds. Unable to see through Japan's empty threats, and unable to do anything, they cannot help but change color at the mere mention of a tiger. Indochina, helpless and dependent on others, should naturally be tense. Third, since Indochina yielded to Japan and blocked transportation to China, Nishihara, a major general dispatched to Indochina by Japan in the name of the "Supervisory Chairman," recently negotiated with the French authorities in Indochina to a near-decisive stage, and returned to Japan the day before yesterday to report on his duties. Any negotiation will naturally have disagreements. It is reported that Konoe's specific strategies for France and Indochina will be based on Nishihara's report. Indochina is uneasy, considering its future destiny. Fourth, it is reported that Japan is extorting aviation bases from the Indochina authorities, demanding to borrow a route to attack Yunnan in China from Indochina. Attacking Yunnan and taking Indochina with one stone would kill two birds, and Indochina would naturally understand.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the reasons for the recent tension in Indochina mentioned above are unexpected storms. On the contrary, it can indeed be said that since the invasion crime in the Far East, up to the outbreak of the European War last year, China took the brunt, and has laid a bright and great foundation for itself through resolute resistance. Other countries, to this day, have mostly tasted the bitter fruit of failing to remedy the situation. Tracing back to the cause, none of them were not due to focusing on empty words in the past, neglecting practical matters, and tolerating the growth of evil causes for a long time. It is too late to regret the extreme pain. The matter is extremely sympathetic, but it is not an unexpected storm.</p>
<p>Regret is always too late. What is the use of simply being heartbroken? The reason why it is still worth pointing this out today is that the past is gone, but the future can be pursued! If France is like this, other countries should take this as a warning and not continue to delay and tolerate. Even in the case of France, it was hoped that the surrender and embargo would allow for an attempt at compromise and delay the disaster. Who knew that insatiable demands would follow closely, becoming more and more intense. Taking this as a warning, be clear about the futility of past surrenders, and resolutely stop continuous compromises. French people must not be discouraged, thinking that they are forced into this situation and blaming it on a lack of strength. Know that lowering your ambitions and surrendering, hoping for a compromise, will still result in destruction and ultimately fail to preserve anything! Do not say temporary, do not say transitional. A temporary grievance is a permanently broken transition. Know that the only way to preserve Indochina is to be unyielding, sincere, maintain Sino-French friendship, and look forward to China's victory. As for the attitude of the United Kingdom, although it is not higher in nature than France, it certainly retains a difference of fifty steps from a hundred steps. The mistakes of the past are before us, and the warnings are not far away! If the United Kingdom continues to attempt compromise, it may as well wait in Burma for the current tense situation in Indochina to occur.</p>
<p>The only ones with the power to reverse the situation and yet have not used it, leading to regret, are the United States and the Soviet Union. Today, the United States and the Soviet Union are in an advantageous position, which France cannot even hope to reach. However, not long ago, England and France were not far behind the United States and the Soviet Union, and they never imagined today's situation. Lessons do not necessarily have to be learned through personal pain, and wisdom often comes from observing others. Shouldn't the people of the United States and the Soviet Union take England and France as a warning today and imagine the future? The United States and the Soviet Union are superior to England and France today, and superior to any other country. However, if it is said that England and France were ill due to past delays and toleration, and that the United States and the Soviet Union can continue to nurture problems and tigers and will eventually have no worries, this certain optimism must be boldness outside the realm of wisdom. When a neighbor's house catches fire and the flames are raging, how can one be indifferent to the safety of one's own home and coldly sit idly by? To contain the flames, cooperation is needed, but before today, the United States and the Soviet Union have been watching each other.</p>
<p>Why watch? Some say that their ambitions are different and they cannot work together. Some say that they have their own hidden worries and cannot attend to others. Some say that they have their own confidence and are fearless. Some say that past rifts are difficult to eliminate. Some say that future interests are actually contradictory. Some say no, all are wrong. Seeing other countries fighting each other, scheming, vying for dominance, their deeds are not worth emulating, their people cannot be taught. They cannot help but have a thought of gloating over their misfortune. Because they are evenly matched, they cannot help but deceive each other. Who will be the last to enter the arena, who will be the last to control. Therefore, they watch and do not move forward. All these miscellaneous theories have their own viewpoints, but they can only explain the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the European situation, not towards the Far East. Regarding the Far East, not only the United States or the Soviet Union, but also England, France, Germany, and Italy, no country's interests are actually consistent with those of the invaders in the Far East. On the contrary, anti-aggression in the Far East is in everyone's best interests. England, France, Germany, and Italy each have their own urgent matters and can be set aside for the time being. However, the actions of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the Far East, which have been close to observation before today, mean that other than the opportunities for cooperation not yet being ripe, there is no other reason, no other explanation. Today, with the United States' sole permission for gasoline to be transported to the Soviet Union, and with the close contact of the US-Soviet trade agreement, comparing this to the attitude of the United States towards other parties, one cannot but think that under the emotion of understanding, the United States and the Soviet Union are promoting the opportunities for cooperation. And the deepening crisis in Indochina reflects the spread of flames and explains the necessity of cooperation. Early maturation is certainly what the world eagerly hopes for!</p>
<h3>Klare's Visit to Matsuoka - Anglo-Japanese Relations Tense Again - Arrest of British Nationals the Result of a Sudden Change in Japanese Policy - British Government Has Twice Protested to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry recently announced that negotiations between British Ambassador to Japan Klare and Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka regarding Anglo-Japanese relations are still continuing. Their discussions began on Saturday and may continue thereafter. On Saturday, Klare told Matsuoka that although Britain is striving to improve friendship, Anglo-Japanese relations have not improved. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The British government has protested to Japan twice for the arrest of British personnel in Japan. British Ambassador Klare, after sending a written protest to the Japanese Foreign Minister, also made an oral protest, demanding that the Japanese side explain the reasons for the arrest of the British nationals. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>London - Authoritative sources reported last night that Britain will formally protest to Japan over the arrest of ten British nationals in Japan at the end of last week. Following reports that Reuters reporter Cox was arrested last Saturday, there were reports that nine more British nationals were arrested. Official confirmation of this was received here last night from Tokyo. Well-informed sources believe that these arrests will cause a new tension in Anglo-Japanese relations after the resolution of the Tianjin British Concession issue and the Yunnan-Burma Road Agreement. According to reports received here indirectly, the ten British nationals were arrested simultaneously in five locations in Japan, for reasons unknown. It is believed here that these arrests are the result of a sudden change in the diplomatic policy of the new Japanese cabinet. British newspapers have prominently reported on this matter, and pointed out that the arrest occurred while British Ambassador to Tokyo Sir Klare was meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. British reports state that the British ambassador complained to Matsuoka that although he was striving to adjust Anglo-Japanese relations, relations between the two countries seemed to be deteriorating. It is said that the British ambassador once pointed out that Britain's agreement to close the Yunnan-Burma Road clearly demonstrated Britain's intention to improve relations with Japan. Sir Klare also raised external rumors that the new Japanese cabinet had a tendency to cooperate with the Rome-Berlin Axis. He further asked whether the current situation, due to these external rumors, would allow Britain and Japan to continue negotiations along the previous path. It is reported that Matsuoka replied that Japan's current foreign policy is under consideration, and therefore he could not give an answer. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said this evening that in view of the increasing activities of foreign spies and conspiracy organizations recently, the military police arrested various components of British spies throughout Japan on Saturday, July 27. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Local News - There is still no news about the other British nationals arrested in various parts of Japan on Saturday besides Cox. However, according to what was heard in Shanghai today, another British national, Mr. Wu Lai of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, was arrested in Kobe. Thus, the total number of British nationals arrested has reached eleven. It is reported that British Ambassador Klare visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Matsumiya for this matter today. It is said that Matsumiya has agreed to try to expedite the police's interrogation of all the arrested British nationals. Today, rumors circulated that the ten British businessmen arrested were related to espionage cases, but whether Cox's arrest was due to the same suspicion or whether there was a special incident is still unclear.

<h3>Cox Died Suddenly After Falling from a Building During Interrogation - Japanese Army and Justice Ministries Issue Communiqué - Saying He Was Suspected of Espionage</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to Domei News Agency, Cox, the chief correspondent for Reuters in Tokyo, was detained by the military police in Tokyo for unknown reasons on Saturday. While being interrogated on the second floor of the military police headquarters, he jumped from the second floor this afternoon and was injured, and died of his injuries one hour and forty-five minutes later. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - This evening, the Japanese Army and Justice Ministries issued a joint communiqué stating that Cox broke away from his guards in the Gendarmerie Department and rushed to the window. Before he could be stopped, he had already fallen. However, the exact nature of the fatal injuries was not announced. The joint communiqué also stated that Cox was detained on suspicion of espionage. It is said that Cox publicly released information important to the Japanese Navy and Army. This was the first time the Japanese authorities broke their silence after banning the release of information about the arrest of British nationals on Saturday. According to the Japanese authorities, a short note addressed to his wife was found in Cox's room, with touching words written in pencil on an envelope. The content conveyed by the Japanese side is as follows: "Regarding the rent, ask Reuters; the funds can be inquired from the [Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation] Bank. I know what is best. [Wife's name] is always my only love. I am being treated well, but there is no doubt as to how things will turn out." There has been no announcement regarding the news of the arrest of other British nationals, nor is it allowed to be transmitted from Japan. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Consequences of British Appeasement Policy</p>
<p>Chinese sources in Chongqing explained that the recent large-scale arrests of British nationals in Japan and Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's brief reply to the British ambassador's inquiry about Japanese foreign policy were all inevitable consequences of Britain's appeasement policy towards Japan. Following Britain's agreement to close the Burma Road, its appeasement policy not only failed to prevent Japan from continuing to encroach on British interests in the Far East, but also isolated Japan and encouraged it to adopt a stronger policy towards third countries in the Far East. Britain's concessions have revealed Britain's weakness. Only by adopting a more resolute attitude and continuing to provide assistance to China can Japan's aggression in the Far East be curbed.

<h3>Pan Gongzhan - Speech in Chongqing - China and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, said in a speech here recently that there will not and cannot be a Munich-like deal in the Far East. He meant that Britain, without the assistance of the United States and the Soviet Union, cannot conclude a Munich Agreement in the Far East. However, when Anglo-Japanese talks began in Tokyo a year ago, the United States terminated its trade agreement with Japan. After the closure of the Burma Road, the United States immediately included the oil and iron being transported to Japan under a licensing system. As for the Soviet Union, it has consistently provided China with material assistance for the past three years. It is important to know that China's position is very different from that of Czechoslovakia, because Czechoslovakia has no set policy and relies solely on foreign aid, while China relies on its rapidly strengthened strength over the past three years of war and is determined to resist.

<h3>China Does Not Feel a Shortage of Gasoline</h3>

President Chiang has ordered a strict ban on the use of unnecessary gasoline. Currently, each government agency is only allowed to have one vehicle, and officials' families are not allowed to use government vehicles. Violators will be punished. The use of private cars is completely prohibited. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<h3>Central Daily News Review – British-German War Situation – German Forces Still Have Difficulty Winning</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News published an article this morning discussing the possibility of German forces invading Britain, stating, “Based on careful research, Germany faces insurmountable difficulties in this endeavor. Britain remains a strong naval power in the Atlantic. Although the French fleet cannot assist Britain, the British fleet alone can control the main sea lanes. On the other hand, Germany must defend its coastline from the Spanish border to northern Norway, and its navy is weak in protecting this coastline. In the current situation, the Italian fleet cannot leave the Mediterranean to participate in the attack on Britain, and the Italian coast is also vulnerable to attack. In summary, Britain, with its strong fleet and effective cooperation with its air force, can defeat a continental power.” (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Remain Indefinitely – Maintaining Contact with Chinese Authorities – Observing Developments in the Far East</h3>

<h3>Pan-American Nations Unanimously – Pass the "Havana Declaration" – Avoid Transfer of Territories in the Western Hemisphere – Assembly Approves and Will Sign Today</h3>
<p>Havana – The Pan-American Conference, when the representatives of the 21 nations unanimously passed the Havana Resolution against the transfer of European territories in the Western Hemisphere today, actually completed its work. Only two formal actions have not yet been implemented, namely the approval and signing of the "Havana Declaration." The declaration is expected to be approved today and signed tomorrow. US Secretary of State Hull, a leader in supporting the resolution on the territorial issue, stated today, "We have completely cleared our agenda." In today's full secret meeting, representatives are expected to express their formal support for the resolution. In tomorrow's public plenary meeting, representatives will reiterate their support and sign the declaration. Representatives have repeatedly stated that such friendly and cooperative discussions among many countries would be impossible in other parts of the world, and that the American continent, as a result of the various resolutions of this conference, has merged into a single continent, combining its military and economic elements. These resolutions are based on the principle of "all for one, one for all." Once the resolutions of the assembly are signed, especially the approval of the Western Hemisphere Security Treaty, these resolutions will become part of the basic laws of each of the 21 nations, and the US Navy will legally become the first line of defense for the American continent. The main points of the provisions regarding European territories in the Western Hemisphere are as follows: (1) The American nations recognize the need for European territories in the Western Hemisphere to seek their own security, do not recognize the situation of forcibly seizing the territories, and do not recognize their transfer to foreign countries. Any actions regarding these lands cannot be considered as territorial expansion in the Americas and should be returned to their original owners at an appropriate time. If this is not possible, their independence should be recognized when they are capable of self-government. (2) If it is necessary to take over these lands, a committee of three members of different nationalities should be appointed to manage their economic, educational, and social needs. These three members should be dispatched by each republic, one from each country. The management committee has the right to request assistance from the army and navy when necessary. (3) The tax revenue of the managed area should be used entirely in that area. If there is a shortfall, it will be provided by the government led by the management committee and reimbursed by the American republics after approval in the future. (United Press dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Havana – The Pan-American Assembly's Committee on Maintaining Peace unanimously passed the "Havana Declaration" yesterday. This declaration aims to prevent anyone from transferring the sovereignty of colonies of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere. US Secretary of State Hull stated that the proposal of the declaration will be submitted to the entire committee, which will be attended by representatives from all countries in the Western Hemisphere. Argentine representative Miro was the first to walk out of the subcommittee room, announcing to the public that the declaration had been passed by the entire committee. Miro called this agreement a "victory for democratic ideals." The Committee on Maintaining Peace met at 4:15 PM and adjourned at 6:30 PM after passing the declaration. The entire committee was convened yesterday and met at 10:30 PM. Secretary of State Hull declared that the Columbian representative had requested to submit a supplementary proposal to the assembly separately. It is believed that the supplementary proposal submitted by the representative does not conflict with the Havana Declaration and that this proposal will also be passed by the committee. (United Press dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>New York – According to the New York Bulletin, the agreement established by the Pan-American Assembly will likely deal a direct and practical blow to international affairs. This Havana Conference can be considered an important victory for Western Hemisphere policy, which has become the cornerstone of President Roosevelt's diplomacy. The agreed-upon method was firmly adopted by the Latin American representatives, and the totalitarian countries, which deeply believed that the conference would fail, will now be disappointed. The New York Times expressed satisfaction with the results of the conference, saying that the agreement cannot solve the urgent problems currently facing the Americas. If we can now contain Hitler's victory in Europe, the problem of economic defense in the Western Hemisphere will be greatly reduced, and the problem of military significance will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, if we ignore the main problem, our policy will be like people being busy scooping water out of a boat while forgetting the important work of plugging the leaks.

<p>Cooperation Committee Passes – Chilean Economic Proposal</p>
<p>Cuban Capital – The Pan-American Conference Economic Cooperation Committee recently passed a proposal put forward by Chile, advocating that Latin American countries take over public utilities companies under the jurisdiction of merchants outside the Americas, which are at risk of being seized by merchants from other countries. This proposal contains a general economic defense plan and will be submitted to the Permanent Economic Committee to determine how to take over these companies. When the head of the Chilean delegation, Hinake, put forward the proposal, he stated that the acquisition of these companies should be stipulated by the constitutions of the countries concerned and can be acquired through confiscation or other means. This is a necessary step to prevent overseas forces from continuing to invade. Most of the public utilities companies in Latin America are owned by British, French, and Dutch merchants.

<p>Washington – Undersecretary of State Welles told the press yesterday that rumors that the French government has asked the United States to state its attitude towards the French territories in the Western Hemisphere, and that it must state what attitude the United States would take if the territories were attacked by non-American powers, but the US government has not received a request from France.

<p>La Paz, Bolivia – Bolivian Foreign Minister Cortadellas recently told reporters, regarding the future of the Pan-American Conference, that there is now the possibility of selling Bolivian tin to the United States for smelting.

<p>Capital of Uruguay – Uruguayan political figures learned last night that opposition members of Congress are increasingly opposed to the resolutions of the Havana Conference.

It is understood that two-fifths of the members of the Uruguayan House of Representatives and half of the senators are members of the National Party. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>French Authorities – Prosecute a Large Number of Celebrities – Including Important Figures in Military, Politics, and Finance – Special Court Will Be Established</h3>
<p>Vichy – The French Council of State is expected to decide today to establish a special court to try military and political figures who are responsible for France's defeat. It is generally believed that Daladier, Campinchi, Mandel, Reynaud, Herriot, Dalbou, Gamelin, Blum, Gut and others will be tried. The court will pay special attention to the fact that the French General Staff adopted a defensive posture for nine months, waiting for the German attack, and Gut's charges are the most numerous, including embezzling public funds and supplying military supplies to Spain. The French authorities are keeping the actions of the above people strictly secret. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Vichy – The list of those responsible for France's entry into the war, released by the French authorities, includes many famous figures in the French economic world.

The Lazard banking group, which used to support Foreign Minister Bonnet, will also be prosecuted. All senior executives of insurance companies and Jews who fled overseas are also on the list. The government will confiscate their property and deprive them of their civil rights. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Vichy – French Minister of Industry and Labor Belin told reporters yesterday that if France cannot restore all its work within the shortest possible time, France will encounter the most difficult period. Industries in the unoccupied areas of France have not been able to resume operations, resulting in a sharp increase in unemployment. The number of unemployed has increased even more since the demobilization of the army. At the same time, the food problem is extremely difficult to solve because a large number of refugees have not been able to return to northern France. This is due to the lack of gasoline fuel, which makes it impossible to transport supplies. Belin continued, "I will suggest to the cabinet to prohibit the waste of gasoline, and violators will be severely punished." (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<p>Madrid – According to a dispatch from Vichy by a correspondent of a Spanish news agency, the negotiations between France and Germany on moving the French government to Paris are not going well. Although it was previously rumored that the French government would meet with the German side on the condition that Marshal Pétain and his aide, Laval, return to Paris, this matter depends on political considerations. This is something that Pétain must consider. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Action Française published an article by Puaseau, which was skeptical about the establishment of the French Unified Party, saying that the party would not achieve much and could not be compared with the large parties of totalitarian countries. The party cannot be organized by government orders but must be initiated by the people. France does not need a formal party at present. To save France, it must rely on the support of all French people for Marshal Pétain. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<h3>Axis Powers Seek – Peaceful Cooperation among Balkan Countries – Romania Prepares to Make Concessions to Hungary and Bulgaria – The Three Countries Will Directly Negotiate to Resolve Disputes</h3>
<p>Sofia – Bulgarian citizens are now paying close attention to the talks between German and Bulgarian politicians in Salzburg. The Bulgarian newspapers have written extensively about Hitler's reception of Bulgarian politicians. Although the results of the talks are unknown, Bulgarian newspapers have expressed optimism. It is heard that Germany and Italy do not intend to mediate the Balkan disputes, but will allow the countries concerned to resolve them themselves. The German newspaper's proposal to abolish the Balkan Entente is also being given attention here. Bulgarian reporters say that the German side recognizes the legitimacy of Bulgaria's land claims, but it is difficult to hope that this issue will be resolved before the end of the war. It is expected that the Bulgarian Prime Minister will return here today and issue a statement on the negotiations. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Rome – Regarding the talks between Romanian politicians and Italian authorities here the day before yesterday, political figures here criticized yesterday, saying that it is now time to conduct direct negotiations based on the Salzburg and Rome Conferences to resolve disputes between the countries of the Danube.

The position of Minister of Foreign Affairs will be concurrently held by Prime Minister Duka. During the previous demonstrations, Mach declared that the principles of the National Socialist Party must be unconditionally applied to Slovakia and that the economic and social aspects are of great importance.

<p>Salzburg – The official announcement here regarding the visit of Slovak President Tiso and Prime Minister Duka to Salzburg states that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held talks with the President and Prime Minister of Slovakia one after another yesterday, and then Hitler received them. German Foreign Minister and Slovak Minister of Propaganda Mach were also present. The negotiations took place in a very friendly spirit. The German Foreign Minister hosted a banquet for the Slovak guests yesterday and saw them off to the station when they left. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The Essen National Daily commented on the talks between Germany and Slovakia in Obersalzberg, saying that although there are some difficulties in Slovakia, they can be solved because the Slovak government trusts Germany. Slovakia is under German protection, but it is completely independent in political, economic, and cultural aspects. The Slovak state was created by Germany, so it is willing to solve all the big and small problems of the country. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<h3>Turkish Transportation Expert Inspects – Trade Routes</h3>
<p>Ankara – The Turkish Ministry of Commerce has dispatched its transportation expert, Buray, to Basra to investigate the possibility of Basra being a trading port for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Buray will then travel to India to increase Turkish trade in India. All these developments are the result of the completion of the railway connecting Basra with Turkey via Baghdad. According to reports, before the signing of the Anglo-French-Turkish treaty, Turkish exports to Germany accounted for 52% of the total, but now it accounts for only 5%, so Germany is quite disappointed.

<h3>Changes in French University Education</h3>
<p>Vichy – Biremen, a reporter for Figaro, claims that the new situation in France has changed the people's university education. The professional schools in Clermont-Ferrand have recruited 8,000 students, most of whom are enrolling because they cannot find work. What France needs in the future are farmers and workers, and the need for engineers and lawyers will gradually decrease. Therefore, there will be major changes in France's aristocratic education.

<h3>One Hundred German Aircraft Attack Southeast England: Fierce Air Battle Over England, Approximately Twenty German Planes Shot Down, British Destroyer "Wren" Sunk</h3>
<p>London: Approximately one hundred German aircraft flew over southeastern England this morning and immediately engaged with British fighter squadrons in a large-scale air battle. It is estimated that about twenty German planes were shot down. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>London: A large number of enemy aircraft carried out attacks this morning along the southeastern coast of England. One was hit, caught fire, and crashed into the sea. It is believed that several others were damaged by anti-aircraft fire. The fighter planes flew very high, so the planes only occasionally appeared from the clouds. This was the second air battle in the area today. One enemy plane dropped multiple incendiary bombs on a town in the central region at night. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, with minimal damage. One bomb pierced the roof of a house and fell into a room where three children were sleeping, but the fire was immediately put out. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security jointly issued a bulletin stating that enemy aircraft flew over several locations on the British coast last night and dropped bombs, causing damage to houses. The number of deaths and injuries was small. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: This morning, about one hundred German aircraft suddenly flew over a town on the southeastern coast of England. Among them, fifty or sixty planes suddenly descended and dropped multiple bombs. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>New York: An American correspondent recently described the scene of German aircraft bombing a British convoy in a port on the southeastern coast of England on the 25th, stating that the German bombing was extremely fierce. He found it hard to believe that anyone could have escaped death. At least four British ships were sunk at the time. German planes flew low to bomb, almost touching the masts. The German planes appeared from the clouds, with two planes forming a team to bomb their target. He witnessed a ship with its hull submerged in the water, but the bow was still above the surface. It sank completely after ten minutes. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The Admiralty announced that the British destroyer "Wren" (1,120 tons, equipped with four 4.7-inch guns) was hit by a bomb and sunk while our patrolling destroyer fleet was engaged in battle with enemy aircraft. Another British destroyer, "Montrose" (1,530 tons), shot down two enemy bombers during the engagement. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The air battle between Britain and Germany intensified yesterday. After a large-scale battle concentrated over the English Channel, the German aircraft were eventually driven back. At the same time, the British Air Force launched a fierce counter-attack on German bases on the continent. German barge fleets, airfields, oil depots, docks, and canals were all targets of British aircraft bombing. (International, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The British Ministry of Aviation recently announced that on Friday and Saturday, British bombers attacked targets including the North Sea Canal in northern Holland, ships in Stavoren, oil depots in Hamburg and Amsterdam, dockyards and wharves in Wilhelmshaven and Bremen, and eight enemy airfields within Holland and Germany. It is now known that on Saturday, British aircraft shot down an enemy fighter plane while bombing an enemy supply ship off the coast of Norway. Another enemy supply ship off the coast of Holland was also bombed and sunk on Saturday. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German war report this afternoon stated that a German submarine commanded by Captain Kretschmer sank one auxiliary cruiser and four armed merchant ships, totaling 48,000 tons. The submarine also launched a torpedo, hitting an armed merchant ship (6,000 tons). Another submarine sank a convoy ship carrying 18,700 tons of cargo. Yet another submarine sank an armed merchant ship near the British coast. German aircraft reconnaissance in the skies over the English Channel resulted in several fierce battles, shooting down six enemy planes. One German plane went missing. Last night, British planes dropped bombs in northern and western Germany. Apart from one bomb that exploded inside a room in Hamburg, there were no other losses. During a British attack on Holland, two enemy planes were shot down by German fighters, one was destroyed by anti-aircraft fire in northern France, and another was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in northern Germany. In total, eleven enemy planes were lost yesterday, and two German planes went missing. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German military department today issued a war bulletin stating that the shooting down of a German rescue plane was the fourth time in several weeks. The plane was rescuing airmen who had fallen into the sea. The fact that this plane was shot down shows that Britain no longer respects the Red Cross symbol. The German Air Force, in adverse weather conditions, sank an auxiliary cruiser (7,000 tons) and a merchant ship (5,000 tons) and damaged two destroyers in the English Channel and off the east coast. Another destroyer and two merchant ships were severely damaged and will also sink. One of them was still there during the second sortie, indicating that it can no longer be used. Military targets attacked along the coast included Swansea Port. Fires were seen burning in several places after the bombing. Several aircraft platforms exploded after being hit in South Wales.

<h3>Large-Scale German Offensive in Preparation on Many Fronts, Circle Around England Shrinking Daily, Soviet Newspaper Says German-Italian Cooperation Successful</h3>
<p>Rome: Ansa Gui, editor of the "Electric News," gave a speech to the Italian military yesterday, stating that anyone who asks when the large-scale invasion of England will begin proves that they have failed to understand the facts of recent weeks. The invasion of England is not a simple matter of landing hundreds of thousands of troops in England and succeeding. It must be based on the military plans of the general staff and be prepared on many fronts. Every observer feels that the large-scale offensive began some time ago. As reported in the German war bulletin, the German encirclement of the British Isles is shrinking daily, which will have a final impact on Britain. In short, the German air force's offensive today, when Britain finally fails, will be admired by the general public. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Red Army's organ newspaper, "Zvezda," yesterday published an article on the success of the German and Italian naval and air forces in attacking England. The article stated that the current German attack aims to scout the weak points of England's coastal defenses, in order to gain air superiority in the English Channel and along the coast. Italy's attacks in the Mediterranean, Africa, and especially East Africa, have now been successful. Since the occupation of Kassala and Gallabat, the Italian military has secured its access to Sudan. Germany is now using its air force to blockade the British Isles. At the same time, Italy has cut off Britain's lines of communication in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Although Germany and Italy have not yet launched a major offensive against England, the two countries have already reaped the rewards of their cooperation. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkish military expert General Ekilit wrote an article in the "Sembodas" newspaper yesterday, discussing Germany's chances of victory in invading England. General Ekilit believes that Germany is currently preparing a plan for military action. During this long period of waiting, it is also stimulating the people's nerves for the offensive. The military strength of Germany and Britain has had many opportunities for mutual probing. Judging from the two major battles in the Norway and Flanders regions, German military strength does have an advantage. The superiority of the German air force has now become an indisputable fact. Britain's maritime superiority has been balanced by the air force bases that Germany has established along the British coast. In fact, Britain's maritime superiority has long been unable to prevent German troops from being transported to Norway. The possibility of German troops landing on the British coast is now being admitted by British military experts as well. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>American Newspaper Observes Future of European Situation</p>
<p>New York: The European war is now approaching its final stage. Germany's intense air raids on England are sufficient to indicate that Germany has decided to implement its blitzkrieg tactics, so as to achieve a successful conclusion by the end of the summer. If Germany wins, Hitler will place all of Europe under his control. As for Italy, apart from being a vassal of Germany, it is difficult for us to believe that it will be able to increase its status and become equal to Germany. Because past history has shown us that two powers cannot coexist. No conqueror wants to have another force competing with them. At that time, Italy will undoubtedly be the temporary custodian of the Adriatic Sea, the western Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa, and Northeast Africa, but its status will only be that of a custodian. At that time, the Soviet Union will also only control the Black Sea and the straits, making helpless Turkey a subordinate state. France has been conquered, Spain will certainly be in Germany's palm, and Portugal is also easy to take. Therefore, at that time, Hitler will politically and economically dominate the entire Old World. As for the United States, if Britain fails, it will become the last democratic country resisting totalitarian control of the world. At that time, Hitler may ally with Japan to contain the United States and seize America's Latin American markets. This action is much easier than launching an attack with actual force. The Havana Conference is the United States' effort to prevent this possible situation, but the result is still doubtful. (United Press, 29th)</p>

<h3>Eden's Inspection Narrowly Averted Disaster</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Local newspapers reported a London dispatch stating that British Secretary of State for War Eden planned to travel by train to inspect the newly built military defense works. He changed to a car in the middle of the journey, inadvertently escaping danger, because someone had secretly placed a bomb on the train, intending to assassinate Mr. Eden. It is believed that this was done by the Irish. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>

<h3>Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands Broadcasts Speech: Fighting for Freedom</h3>
<p>London: The British Broadcasting Corporation will broadcast a Dutch program once a day from now on. Today, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands began with her first broadcast. The lady addressed the audience in Dutch, saying, "It has become increasingly clear that this war has become a struggle between good and evil. One side is fighting for God and our conscience, and the other side is the rising force of darkness. All who wish to operate everything in the world for the happiness of mankind and wish that their work is not destroyed by evildoers, their freedom is now in danger, just as it was in the early days of the war. Military flames, poverty, and pain cannot eliminate our true love of freedom, nor can they eliminate freedom of conscience and religion. Therefore, I firmly believe that we, and all those who think alike, will eventually transcend this holy suffering and ordeal. Our beloved flag is still proudly flying on the eastern and western seas of Greater Holland. Our warriors are still fighting alongside the Allies. The overseas empire deeply sympathizes with the disasters suffered by the motherland. In their thoughts and emotions, they are still closely united with us, and even more so than before. We intend to uphold the independence of all our regions with unwavering unity, and will not cease fighting until the bright prospects of freedom and happiness have dawned." (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>Pune: After eight hours of debate, the All-India Congress approved the draft resolution passed by the All-India Congress Committee in New Delhi on July 7 by a vote of 95 to 63. The resolution stipulates that if Britain allows India to form a temporary national government, as the first step toward granting India complete independence, then the All-India Congress will assist Britain in the war. Seven amendments were proposed during the debate, all by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Most of them pointed out that the proposal represented a policy of surrendering to British imperialism. Four of these amendments were withdrawn without being put to a vote, and the remaining three were rejected by a majority vote. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Konoe Becomes Japanese Dictator, New Government Policies to Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to well-informed sources, since the major reform of the Japanese administrative structure, Konoe Fumimaro has become the de facto dictator of the Japanese Empire. After the first meeting of the new Japanese cabinet last week, it is reported that Konoe has acquired all of the highest government powers, including the Navy and Army. Political figures report that the Konoe cabinet has made a strong start, as the new administrative structure has authorized the Prime Minister to govern the entire Empire. Some expect that Konoe's all-embracing power will cause discontent among young military officers, but it is widely believed that Japan will eventually accept this new administrative structure, because in the eyes of the public, this is the only main way to promote Japan's domestic and foreign policies. It is believed that the government's new policies will be announced tomorrow. The cabinet secretary general announced last week that the Navy and Army General Staff had put forward a plan to "resolve the situation arising from the rapid changes in the world." It is said that the new cabinet and the Navy and Army have reached "absolute agreement." (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Konoe cabinet will abandon the British and American routes in diplomacy. After the supply of oil and iron from the United States is cut off, resolving this issue is of decisive importance to Japan. It is hoped that various measures will be agreed upon around August 1.

<h3>American Republican Party Studies Far East Situation, Criticizes Roosevelt's Policies</h3>
<p>Washington: Leaders of the American Republican Party have recently conducted a careful study of the situation in the Far East, in order to set a clear foreign policy as a tool for future presidential campaigns. Crawford, a Republican Congressman from Michigan and a frequent commentator on Far East issues, recently accused President Roosevelt of intending to have the United States join the Far East war only when circumstances require it. Crawford said that although President Roosevelt reluctantly guaranteed that he would not send troops to Europe, he has never definitively decided not to have his naval and air forces participate in the Far East war. Roosevelt had stated that there was nothing to make us feel that we were unnecessarily interfering in the Far East to protect the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and that the Republicans' enemies have said that there is no sufficient reason to oppose America's active Far East policy. As for him (Crawford), he will oppose any Far East policy that would lead the United States into war. However, general observers say that the Republican leaders will decide whether to make Far East diplomacy a major national policy with extreme caution, because a part of American opinion, in view of Japan's leaning towards the German-Italian axis, mostly advocates taking direct action to deal with Japan.

(Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Wellington: New Zealand Minister of Defence Jones recently reviewed the recently concluded volunteer recruitment system, saying that a total of 80,000 volunteers have been recruited for the Navy, Army, and Air Force to serve overseas, and a total of 63,747 volunteers have been recruited for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Two of these battalions have already arrived overseas. The government has also trained a part of the Defence Force, which, together with the newly formed units, will have a strength of 30,000 men. New Zealand will be the first dominion to reach the highest level in carrying out the Imperial Aviation Plan. At that time, New Zealand will be able to supply 3,700 fully or partially trained airmen each year. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Spain's American Oil Imports Issue</h3>
<p>Stockholm: The Spanish Ambassador to Britain, the Duke of Alba, published an open letter in the Times, opposing the suggestion made by the British newspapers that the United States should stop transporting oil to Spain. The letter stated, "Your newspaper published a report from the New York Times on July 22 concerning Spain's gasoline imports." This is based on the propaganda of a certain British magazine. The amount of oil currently imported by Spain is only half of its normal needs, so the Spanish government has had to restrict the use of oil. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Inspection of Mail in the French Concession - Chinese and Foreign Parties Closely Watching - Resolution Only Possible Upon Chapellier's Return to Shanghai - Independence and Integrity of Postal Administration Maintained</h3>
<p>The Japanese side's attempt to inspect mail at the Route Massenet post office in the French Concession, with personnel sent daily to inspect the office premises and copy the names of mailbox renters, and to create maps of the branch postal district, seems to be becoming increasingly concrete. There are even widespread rumors that it will be implemented from August 1st. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Residents Express Concerns</p>
<p>Within the French Concession, the Chinese population is extremely opposed to the issue of the Japanese side sending "mail inspectors" to examine mail. They all believe that residents of the French Concession have fulfilled their tax obligations to the French Municipal Council. The Japanese side's implementation of mail inspection within the French Concession is tantamount to hindering the freedom of correspondence for residents. Therefore, everyone sincerely hopes that the French authorities will immediately reject it and protect the rights and interests that residents should enjoy. Furthermore, foreign residents within the French Concession, such as residents of Britain, the United States, and other countries, have also unanimously expressed their opposition, because the inspection of mail certainly not only harms the rights and interests of the Chinese. Currently, diplomatic authorities of various countries, such as Britain and the United States, are also paying close attention to the development of this event.</p>
<p>French Consul-General Declines to Comment</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported, "It is learned that the Japanese authorities in this city are expected to begin inspecting mail in the French Concession this week. This morning (29th), a reporter asked the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Oltramare, about this matter, but he refused to say a word. However, it is widely believed that Postmaster Chapellier will approve Japanese inspectors to enter the French Concession after he returns to Shanghai from Kunming on Wednesday."</p>
<p>Postal Independence Not Undermined</p>
<p>A reporter from the "Ta Chung News Agency" visited Mr. Wang Weisheng, Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the process and truth of the French Concession mail inspection incident. Mr. Wang avoided all political viewpoints regarding this matter and gave a detailed interview to the reporter. According to him, the Japanese inspection of mail began at the General Post Office a year ago. This is a politically unavoidable move. However, although mail is being inspected, the independence and integrity of postal administration have not been subject to any restrictions or damage. The postal service is an international institution, and the strictness of the postal system is sufficient to guarantee that postal administration avoids being drawn into the whirlpool of politics. This should be understood by members of society. Since the General Post Office began mail inspection, if inspectors believe that a certain item of mail needs to be detained, if the detained item is an express letter or registered letter, the inspector must issue a receipt to the post office, and the post office must also notify the recipient in writing that the mailed item has been detained to fulfill its duty. If ordinary mail is detained, the post office must also register it, but as a rule, the recipient is not notified.</p>
<p>Chapellier Expected to Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also stated that the Japanese side did indeed have several contacts with the post office regarding the inspection of mail in the French Concession beforehand. However, he had not heard of the saying that it would be implemented on August 1st. There are a total of five branch offices in the French Concession: Route Massenet, Xujiahui, Route Conty, and Rue du Sacré-Cœur, four of which are "delivery branch offices." Route Massenet has a wider scope because it previously made a "combined delivery" with Route Cardinal Foch. There are about a hundred letter carriers. All local mail delivered within the area of "delivery branch offices" does not need to be transferred through the General Post Office and can be delivered directly. As for the installation of mailboxes, in addition to the General Post Office, the two branch offices on Route Massenet and Heng Road are specially permitted to install them. Recently, the Yuyuan Road branch office will also install mailboxes. Director Chapellier was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but due to encountering a typhoon in Hong Kong, the "Yusheng" ship he was on only left Hong Kong yesterday. Therefore, he is scheduled to arrive on August 1st. After Chapellier arrives in Shanghai, there will be a decision on the Liu mail inspection matter.</p>
<p>Hope to Avoid Political Narratives</p>
<p>Mr. Wang finally told the reporter with a sincere attitude that if the French Concession inspection is implemented, he sincerely hopes that members of society will avoid all political narratives or discussions when writing letters, so that all unnecessary losses can be avoided. Because Shanghai is a complex international city, it should adopt all prudent attitudes to remove all unnecessary troubles for itself. According to another source, the French Concession authorities are also closely monitoring this matter and discussing countermeasures.</p>
<p>Japanese Personnel Again Went for Preparations Yesterday</p>
<p>Since four Japanese personnel went to the Route Massenet post office for inspection last Saturday, at about 1:00 p.m. yesterday, the four Japanese personnel went to the branch again to copy all the charts and documents of the office, and inspected the procedures for mail management. Although they temporarily worked at a long table outdoors yesterday, the formal office location seems to be under preparation. The four Japanese personnel did not leave until 5:00 p.m. According to the person in charge of the branch, the matter of inspecting mail has now reached the point where it is only waiting for instructions from the General Post Office. The arrangement of the office and the various procedural issues of inspecting mail will be handled quickly once instructions from the General Post Office arrive. According to reliable sources, although the four Japanese personnel did not state their purpose when inspecting the branch, it is believed that they are carrying out preparatory work so that they can be proficient in all procedures when officially inspecting mail in the future. Although the date for starting mail inspection has not been determined, judging from the fact that the Japanese personnel have already gone to the branch to work, the date of implementation seems to be near.</p>
<h3>Criminal Court President Qian Hongye of the Special No. 1 Court Assassinated Yesterday - Assailants Followed Him from the Court to His Residence at Noon - Three Shots, All in Vital Spots, Result in Death</h3>
<p>At around 12:00 noon yesterday, an assassination suddenly occurred at the back gate of the Yin Du Ice Skating Rink on Route Ghisi and Route Cardinal Foch. The victim was Qian Hongye, Criminal Court President of the Special No. 1 Court of the Public Concession. He was shot three times in the chest and abdomen on the spot, all in vital spots. He died at 4:15 p.m. The two assailants who opened fire escaped without a trace on bicycles. Details are learned as follows:</p>
<p>Taking a Chartered Car to Court Every Day</p>
<p>Qian Hongye, a native of Hangzhou, is currently 50 years old and resides at No. 43, Model Village on Route Cardinal Foch. He is well-known in the judicial circles. He is the current Criminal Court President of the Special No. 1 Court of the Public Concession, a position he has held for many years. He is known for his wisdom, integrity, and good reputation. He usually travels in a chartered car with license plate number 11, and employs Liu Ada, a native of Nantong, as his chauffeur. This has been the case for six years. Every morning around 8:00 a.m., Qian takes the chartered car to the temporary office of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court in the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road to work. If there is a criminal trial, he then switches to a car to the Criminal Court of the First Court on Zhejiang Road to hear the case. Yesterday morning, Qian followed the usual routine to work at the temporary office on Weihaiwei Road. He finished his official duties at around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Assailants Intercepted and Shot</p>
<p>He planned to return to his residence for lunch and took the chartered car again. When the chauffeur Liu Ada pulled the car westward to the back gate of the Yin Du Ice Skating Rink at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Route Cardinal Foch, suddenly two assailants, both wearing Western-style suits on their upper bodies and shorts on their lower bodies, each riding a bicycle, chased from behind. The two cars overtook the chartered car, recognized Qian Hongye, and without asking any questions, pulled out handguns and fired four or five shots in a row. Qian was sitting upright in the car and could not avoid the attack. He was shot once in the chest and twice in the abdomen, and blood gushed out like a spring. He was barely breathing. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assailants sped away westward on bicycles. When the patrolmen from the two concessions nearby heard the alarm and rushed over, the assailants were already long gone.</p>
<p>Severely Wounded and Died Tragically</p>
<p>They quickly summoned an ambulance to the scene and sent Qian to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the doctors performed surgery and carefully treated him, the wounds were in vital spots, and medicine was ineffective. He died in the hospital at around 4:15 p.m. The police authorities of the two concessions attached great importance to Qian's tragic shooting and death. They strictly ordered the detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators within a limited time. At the same time, the chauffeur and the chartered car were taken to the French Concession police station. The chauffeur was strictly interrogated about the circumstances of his master's death. A large number of detectives were then sent to the scene of the incident to investigate and collected empty bullet casings, which were taken back to the police station for research.</p>
<p>Sons and Daughters Rushed to See Him, Overwhelmed with Grief</p>
<p>Qian was wearing a white Indian silk long gown, with silk shirt and pants inside, a straw hat, and black straight-gong cloth shoes. It is reported that his wife, Xu, passed away three years ago. He only has one son named Silang, 33 years old, who is a professor at the Southwest Associated University in Kunming. He is married to Zhang and has two sons. Due to the summer vacation, Silang brought his family back to Shanghai to visit his relatives. Unexpectedly, less than ten days after arriving in Shanghai, a major accident occurred. After the case occurred yesterday afternoon, Silang and his wife rushed to the hospital to visit him, shedding tears and extremely grief-stricken. It is also learned that Qian had received threatening letters, and the concession police authorities had sent two plainclothes detectives to protect him, but he declined. The French Concession police station also sent several armed police officers to stand guard around his residence in Model Village, but Qian also politely declined.</p>
<p>News Spread, All Circles Mourned</p>
<p>Qian Hongye graduated from the Beijing National Law School in the first year of the Republic of China. He was deeply knowledgeable in law. He served as a judge in the Dali Yuan of the Ministry of Justice in Beijing for many years and achieved remarkable political achievements. In April of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to Shanghai Public Concession (when the court was reorganized) as the Prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court. In May of one year, he became the Criminal Court President of the court and has held this position for more than ten years. After the news of Qian's death spread, all circles in the city were shocked and mourned, and his colleagues in the judicial circles were particularly saddened.</p>

<h3>Users of Shanghai Electric Construction Company Eagerly Hope for Swift Resolution of Labor Dispute - All Employees State Reasons for Strike</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese directors of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company's worker slowdown, including Yu Qiaqing, are very concerned but have not yet formally mediated. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter, Mr. Yu has not yet met with the company's chairman, Kadoorie, but may visit him in the coming days to mediate. Workers issued a statement yesterday outlining the reasons for the slowdown and criticizing the failure to treat Chinese employees the same as foreign employees. All parties hope that the labor dispute can be resolved quickly, especially the company's users.</p>
<p>Workers Appeal</p>
<p>The statement issued by all Chinese employees regarding the slowdown reads as follows: "Our company's employees previously experienced a slowdown three months ago. Unexpectedly, less than three months later, the employer used a pretext to dismiss Yang Hanzhang, the former representative of the workers. Thereupon, the remaining workers, seeing this situation, felt that the company had suddenly gone back on its agreement, and everyone felt insecure. All workers in the old factory to which Mr. Yang belonged demanded on the 18th of this month that the company immediately reinstate Mr. Yang to fulfill its promise, and attached several conditions necessary for daily life. Unexpectedly, the employer did not consider it at all. The workers had no choice but to suspend work. During this period, Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Mediation Division of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department came to mediate, but the employer refused to negotiate and instead spent a large sum of money to hire a large number of White Russians to work in the factory, ignoring the employees and on the 24th, the employer again convened employee representatives and ordered them to resume work, otherwise they would be treated as resigned. The cruelty of this method is rare in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Unequal Profit Sharing</p>
<p>According to the company's prosperous business last year, it can be said that the company had never seen such prosperity since its opening. Last year's profits were as high as one million several hundred thousand yuan. Western employees can receive subsidies of 100% and 80%, while Chinese employees receive very little. It is very painful to say. The most is only 40%, and it must be limited to those with salaries below 50 yuan. Others are only 35% or 30%. Comparing the two, there is a world of difference. To prevent rumors from being untrue and distorting the truth, we hereby inform all circles of the circumstances of this slowdown, and hope for sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Final Conditions</p>
<p>Workers in the old and new factories held a meeting the night before last (Sunday) to discuss how to deal with the situation. They decided to revise the five preconditions previously presented to the employer and unanimously decided that this was the last step. The conditions are as follows: (1) Dismiss the White Russian workers. (2) Reinstate the dismissed worker Yang Hanzhang. No workers should be dismissed without reason. If the factory intends to lay off workers, severance pay should be paid for six months of the last wage, and savings should be calculated at 5%. (3) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike period. (4) Wages should be increased by 12 yuan across the board, wages should be increased by 10% each year, and a one-month bonus should be given annually. Restore half of the 1936 wage. (5) Rice subsidies. If the price of rice is above 20 yuan, the factory should subsidize 60 cents per yuan. Commodity subsidies remain the same. (Attachment) All unexpected conditions cannot be changed according to the previous (April) conditions. The above conditions were submitted in writing to Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu by the labor side yesterday morning, asking them to pass them on to the employer. It is said that the employer insisted on (1) deducting wages during the strike period and (2) dismissing one-third of the workers before agreeing to negotiate. According to rumors, the content of the labor dispute is becoming increasingly complex, and some people are trying to intervene. Fortunately, the workers' attitude remains unchanged and reconciliation is approaching.</p>
<h3>Group Rice Orders Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 2,300 bags of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by the "Special Food Commission" through the Banque de l'Indochine on the 13th of this month (the first batch after the "revised ordering method") arrived in Shanghai yesterday and are currently in the warehouse. The association has already sent letters to the commission's customers urging them to promptly take delivery of their orders. A second batch of orders is being actively pursued, with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and others each ordering several hundred bags. This batch is scheduled to be ordered from Saigon through the Banque de l'Indochine within days. The foreign rice ordered by the association is a total of one stone and two and a half dou per bag. Because of the lengthened foreign exchange rate and the expected large rice production in Saigon, the price is relatively cheap. Therefore, each bag of the foreign rice ordered in this project is four to five yuan less than the market price. Total rice delivered in the last three days amounted to over 50,000 bags.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that it has appointed Sir Miles, Melly, and Bessley as the SMC representatives on the "Special Rice and Grain Commission." The special committee may hold a meeting in the "central district" this Thursday, and there are rumors that Japanese puppet "representatives" will be in attendance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves - Shortening of Pawn Period</h3>
<p>The case of pawnbroking businesses shortening the pawn period to twelve months has now been approved by a ministry order. The original telegram is as follows: "Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, fully understood the telegraphed report and attachments from May of the 29th year. The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association is provisionally shortening the pawn period to twelve months in accordance with the case, and will restore the original pawn period when the market stabilizes. This should be approved for the record. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Finance, you must immediately notify and inform them." Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>

<h3>Ningbo and Zhenhai Restore Prosperity - Japanese Warships Return to Bombard, Chinese Army Ignores - Japanese Izumo Ship Leaves Shanghai Yesterday, Destination Unknown</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai received a follow-up telegram from Zhenhai since its recovery: (1) At 8:07 a.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese plane was spotted over Guanhaiwei. The plane then passed through Cixi, Fenghua, and Ninghai, and then went out to sea. (2) Three small Japanese warships anchored in the waters off Shita Mountain in the Huangda Yang area outside An Dong, Yuyao, released speedboats carrying troops. When the Japanese warships opened fire to provide cover, they attempted to land on Yingsheng Street in Yuyao, but were repelled by our garrison. (3) One Japanese warship was anchored in the waters off Longshan and Yanggang outside Zhenhai Port. The Japanese warship anchored at Ligang weighed anchor at 10:47 a.m. the day before yesterday and moved towards Zhenhai. When it sailed to the waters off Qiliji, it suddenly fired fifteen shots at Zhenhai without any purpose. Because of the distance, the bullets all landed on the beach and mud, so there were no losses. At 4:47 p.m., a Japanese warship anchored in the waters off Longshan sailed east to the sea outside Zhaobao Mountain and also suddenly fired more than ten shots at Zhenhai without any purpose. It then turned around and fled. The garrison responded calmly and did not return fire. The above two Japanese warships sailed to the waters off Longshan at 2:30 p.m. and anchored. Currently, except for this one Japanese warship, there are no other Japanese warships outside the port.</p>
<p>Local Situation</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, after the recovery of Zhenhai, administrative agencies have moved back into the city to work, the police have returned to their posts, and stores in Nanmen and the streets have also opened. Residents are returning one after another. However, most of the stores and houses in the Ximen area have been destroyed, presenting a scene of desolation. Numerous porridge factories have been established in the city to provide food for disaster victims. A large number of abandoned corpses were found in the war zones of Jiangnan Xiaogang, Qingzhiling, Jinjishan, and Jiangbei Zhaobaoshan. The Ningbo Burial Team has actively cleaned up and buried them, and the work has been completed. Floating corpses on the Daxie River and Xiaoxie River have also been salvaged and buried. Therefore, the fortress area has been restored to its original clean appearance, and the defenses have been rearranged to become more solid. Order in Ningbo has been restored more quickly. Shops have resumed business during the day. All pawnshops have returned to the city and opened. Banks have moved to Sheng County, so the return to work is slower, but it can be completed today and business can resume as usual.</p>
<p>Izumo Leaves Shanghai</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that the flagship Izumo of the Japanese fleet stationed in China was not seen at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company wharf on Huangpu Road today (29th). It is widely believed that the ship sailed to a certain point on the Zhejiang coast where military action is taking place. A Japanese naval spokesman said that due to military reasons, he could not disclose the exact destination of the Izumo, but according to another Japanese source, the Izumo may be sailing to various ports along the Yangtze River as usual. There is no clear news whether the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, Shimada Shigetaro Nakamura, is on the Izumo, but it is known that he is traveling with the flagship.</p>

<h3>British War Film Banned from Screening in French Concession - Allegedly Because It Has Not Been Approved - May Be Shown Privately After Review</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Catholic Church at 135 Avenue Dubail, French Concession, was scheduled to show a British official war film last night (28th), but was suddenly banned by the French Concession police before the screening was about to begin. The film is a newsreel shot by Paramount Pictures on the European battlefield, such as the Battle of Narvik, the Retreat from Dunkirk, and British air defense. It has not been inspected and is not being shown publicly in Shanghai. The reason is obvious, but it has been lent to various associations for showing to their members and invited guests. The film was scheduled to be shown privately at the Catholic Church at 9:15 p.m. last night. About 400 viewers were present, and the hall was packed. Five minutes after the scheduled start time, the church's chairman, Pastor MacGregor, suddenly announced that the French police had banned the screening on the grounds that the film had not been inspected by the French authorities. The audience, upon hearing the news, not only did not show any signs of opposition, but also expressed sympathy and quietly dispersed. Pastor MacGregor told reporters last night that the French police had sent personnel to the meeting and instructed him to stop the screening because the film had not been approved by the French inspector. A spokesman for the French police also said that the film's screening in the French Concession was only delayed, not completely banned. Once it has passed the inspection, it will be allowed to be screened non-publicly in the French Concession. The British authorities have not yet made any comments on this matter. It is understood that the Archbishop's Church's screening of the film last night was purely non-public, only for members to watch, and no admission fee was charged. Ordinary members of the public were not allowed to enter. It is reported that there were some Italian nationals among the audience, and the Counselor of the Italian Consulate was also present. The English Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury also reported that an official from the French Concession Police Force recently told reporters that the Catholic Church originally scheduled to show a European war film last night. Because there were forty or fifty nationals of a belligerent country among the audience, Pastor MacGregor, fearing that there would be disturbances, reported it to the French Police Force. An officer arrived at the scene fifteen minutes before the film was shown. Pastor MacGregor explained to him, and on the advice of the officer, announced that the film's screening would be postponed.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on American Sailors' Night Out Newly Set - Shortened to Midnight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported yesterday (28th) that the liberty of American sailors stationed in Shanghai has been temporarily shortened to midnight. According to the new order issued by the American authorities, personnel of American ships stationed in Shanghai are not allowed to enter entertainment venues after midnight and must return to their warships or barracks before midnight. However, those who have residences in Shanghai and have obtained special permission are allowed to stay ashore past midnight. This order took effect at midnight yesterday. As for the liberty of American Marines, it is also currently limited to midnight. In peacetime, the liberty of American Marines and Navy personnel is generally wider than it is now. It is widely believed that the restrictions currently imposed by the American authorities may be related to recent unexpected events.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Acting Governor Approves Ban on Tea Re-Exports; 10,000 Cases of Chinese Tea Controlled</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government authorities, based on Articles 5 and 10 of the 1940 Defence Ordinance and with the approval of the Acting Governor, have now announced through the Commissioner of Commerce and Industry a ban on the transport and export of tea from Hong Kong. This restriction does not apply to those with permits approved and issued by the Commissioner. It is noted that Chinese tea, after the war, has been concentrated in Hong Kong for re-export, mostly to the Americas and the Soviet Union. It has been managed and sold by the Fuhua Company. This spring, to expand its business, it was merged into the China Tea Company for exclusive operation, leading to a surge in overseas sales. Currently, around 10,000 cases of Chinese tea are stored in Hong Kong. Now that exports are controlled, the overseas market for Chinese tea is bound to suffer some impact.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Association Group Insurance Postponed</h3>

<h3>Fraudulent Acts Used as Basis; Appeal Rejected; Chen Ren Remains with Original Sentence</h3>
<p>At the end of last lunar year, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank had complex accounts. Someone transferred a check from a certain customer and forged a signature to fraudulently obtain 17,000 National Currency dollars. The bank discovered this and found that Chen Renhao, a staff member from Ningbo working in the seal department, was highly suspected. The bank reported this to the Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng to arrest Chen for investigation. Mei Kan, an expert appraiser from the Public Works Department, conducted a detailed examination of the signature on the check and related documents. The handwriting matched Chen's completely. Chen was then handed over to the First Special District Court, which filed a public prosecution for forgery. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate 17,000 National Currency dollars. Chief Judge Qian Hongye conducted multiple hearings, but the defendant vehemently denied the charges, criticized the inaccuracy of the Public Works Department's handwriting analysis, and requested a re-examination. Judge Qian then ordered the defendant to post 8,000 dollars in cash for bail and commissioned a local calligrapher to conduct a re-examination, which also confirmed that the handwriting matched. At the conclusion of the trial, the verdict was announced. The main point of the verdict was that Chen Ren was found guilty of forgery and fraudulently obtaining property and was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, with a three-year reprieve, and ordered to compensate the Zhejiang Industrial Bank 17,000 National Currency dollars. Because the defendant was dissatisfied with the verdict, he appealed to the First Branch of the High Court. The case was adjudicated yesterday, and the appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>British Children in China Evacuated from England to Shanghai; Arrive on the Empress of Russia Yesterday; Relatives Reunite After Long Separation, Overjoyed and Saddened</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the British government is actively evacuating children from certain areas of England for their safety. Some British expatriates residing in Shanghai and China, unwilling for their children in England to take refuge in Canada or the United States without parental care, entrusted a travel agency to arrange for their children to gather in Liverpool and depart by ship to Montreal, Canada. They then took a train to Vancouver and boarded the "Empress of Russia" to Shanghai, arriving at the port at approximately 10:20 AM this morning (the 29th). Their parents and relatives were already waiting at the customs dock. Reunion after a long separation brought both joy and sorrow. The ages of these British children ranged from six to sixteen. When they set off from Liverpool, there were originally forty-two people. During the journey, more than ten of them remained in Canada. As a result, only about thirty people arrived in Shanghai this morning. They will continue their education in Shanghai or other Chinese ports. According to several children, they received excellent treatment along the way. When crossing the Atlantic Ocean from England to Canada, the route was dangerous, and lights were controlled to avoid accidents. However, when crossing the Pacific Ocean to China, the journey was smooth.</p>

Its members are M. Bauand, N. Poutet, and M. Fredet.</p>
<h3>The Loss of the Sanshandao Shoal at the Mouth of the Song River Endangers Navigation</h3>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, the Sanshandao Shoal outside the mouth of the Wusong River, located in the center of where the Yangtze River flows into the sea, is 20 li from the mouth of the Yangtze River and has a large area. At low tide, the depth is only 17 feet, hindering the passage of ships. The Shanghai Bureau of Hydraulic Engineering planned a five-year dredging project in 1935 to facilitate navigation, but the project was halted due to the sudden outbreak of war. The accumulation of silt has severely hindered ships entering and leaving the river and the sea.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Apprentice Mistakenly Kidnapped; Released After Questioning</h3>
<p>Yuanshengchang Rice Shop, located at the entrance of Yongping Lane on Medhurst Road, has been in business for many years. At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, the shop sent an apprentice, Shen Jinxiang (19 years old, from Zhenru), to collect payment from the Tungsheng Firm, a fellow business on Singapore Road in western Shanghai. He boarded a Route 17 bus. When the bus arrived at the Jiaozhou Road/Singapore Road stop, the apprentice hastily got off. After walking only a few steps, he suddenly saw three men holding box cannons, who forced him into a black car parked by the side of the road. Inside the car, there was already one person wearing an Indian silk long gown and a white straw hat, who sat with Shen. The bandits warned him not to make any noise. The car sped south. Before long, they forced him out of the car and into house number 22 in a certain alley. A bandit leader questioned him in detail and asked if he was the young master of the rice shop. When Shen explained that he was only an apprentice, they did not believe him. They then thoroughly searched his entire body but found nothing. After an hour, the bandits concluded that there was no point in detaining him and ordered him to leave. Shen narrowly escaped.</p>

Since Shi was assassinated in January of this year, the two stores have been managed separately by his wife, Wu, and his concubine, Lu. The former is managed by the concubine, and the latter is managed by the wife. Recently, Cheng Fukang, a clerk at Xinyongfa Store, managed by Shi's concubine, Lu, was ordered by his mistress to purchase hemp bags for 1,100 yuan. Unexpectedly, Cheng absconded with the money. Lu reported the case to the police. Chief Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Zhu Wanjun of the General Patrol House apprehended Cheng. According to Cheng, he embezzled the money under the instigation of Shi's wife, Wu. The detectives arrested Wu and handed her over to the First Special Court for interrogation.

<p>Abandoning Biological Daughter</p>
<p>Xu Tangshi, a local woman of 54 years old, residing at 310 Jiaxiyi Road, hired lawyer Yin Yong to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District against her daughter-in-law, Qu Jinfen (19 years old, from Changzhou, residing at 6 Shenyu Lane, Wuding Road, Medhurst Road), and her mother-in-law, Qu Wangshi, for abandoning her biological daughter and leading a crowd to commit violence. The statement roughly stated that her son, Yun Sheng, married Qu Jisheng's daughter, Jinfen, as his wife in the winter of 1938. On February 9 of this year, she gave birth to a granddaughter named Baodi, who was breastfed by Jinfen herself. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of June 18, Jinfen abandoned her granddaughter Baodi on the bed and ran away with gold bracelets, clothes, and other items. The next day, she led a crowd to her residence, where she slapped and beat her without reason. She is a lonely woman, and this beating caused her both physical and mental harm. Furthermore, Jinfen abandoned her four-month-old daughter at home, who cries day and night, begging for food. Therefore, she is filing a lawsuit, requesting that they be punished accordingly. The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the case, ordering a rescheduling for reconciliation. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued. As there was no hope of reconciliation, he ordered a debate and scheduled the pronouncement of the verdict for the 31st.</p>

<h3>Grain, Another 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Rice Prices Fluctuate by Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>At the market opening yesterday morning, spot foreign rice saw a more drastic drop. Buyers were watching quietly and did not make any purchases. Vendors and speculators were trying to sell off their holdings, and prices plummeted, but buyers turned a deaf ear. No transactions were made until the middle of the market, with Fire Jiao priced at only 47-48 yuan and Number 2 Jian at 44-45 yuan. Then, local shops took advantage of the low prices to buy, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing the situation to reverse and tighten. Prices for various goods were easy to fall and easy to rise, and suddenly rebounded by about two yuan. By the close, Number 1 Chen Saigon had reached 51 yuan, new rice 50 yuan, Number 2 Chen Jian 47.5 yuan and 47 yuan, new rice 46 yuan, and Fire Jiao Jian 50 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice rose and fell sharply yesterday, with a difference of three to four yuan. In the early morning, continuing the weak trend of the previous day, the prices of all kinds of spot rice fell, with spot rice falling by as much as two yuan. Later, because the owners were unwilling to sell at low prices, and local buyers were eager to buy for actual sales and new hoarding, the prices immediately returned to their original levels. At the afternoon close, there was even talk of raising prices. Because most of the road cargo original bags have arrived, due to monetary relations, the drop in the early market was extremely fierce. The opening price for spot original bags of Number 2 Siam rice reached 54.5 yuan, and newly arrived rice was quoted lower at 54 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan and 2.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. The opening price for original bags of newly arrived or soon-to-arrive rice to be re-exported also reached 55 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. As prices fell, large firms were unwilling to continue to lose money, and those who had made profits and new speculators took the opportunity to buy, and the market atmosphere changed. Prices gradually rebounded amid buying. Imports were quoted as high as 47 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to last Saturday, and re-exports were quoted as high as 48 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan, both rebounding by three yuan from the low prices in the morning. However, buyers were not real consumers, and the outlook for the market is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Another large batch of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Zha Hua Company's Zhi Bi Sha ship, which went to Saigon to load rice, returned to Shanghai around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (Saturday), carrying 4,000 tons of foreign rice, totaling more than 41,000 bags. It docked at the Puxi Blue Funnel Wharf and began unloading yesterday. Also yesterday, the Jardine Matheson Company's Yong Sheng ship arrived, carrying 9,340 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is reported that there are more large batches coming later. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although the supply of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice is still limited, when foreign rice prices plummeted, it was rumored that outside the market, the owners had no intention of defending prices and were focused on selling quickly. Buyers knew that the trend was irreversible and adopted a "get through it" mentality, causing prices to fall by as much as four or five yuan. Later, following foreign rice, prices rebounded slightly, but selling prices had already fallen significantly. Chang Bang Xian Special Japonica was only 63-64 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica was around 60 yuan, next grade to Su Kun was 55-56 yuan, Qing Si Bo Dao was 61-62 yuan, Nan Gang Hu Zao was 55-56 yuan, Liyang glutinous rice was 58 yuan, Changzhou glutinous rice was 56-57 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice was 56-54 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Drop Another 50 Cents</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the price of Number 2 flour from the Japanese flour mill was changed from 15.5 yuan to 15 yuan, a decrease of another 50 cents. Because retail sales on the Japanese street have been sluggish recently, and sales to customers have been quiet. Furthermore, the price of rice has fallen sharply, and everyone is bearish on the market. Japanese mills, benefiting from low wheat prices, have already depreciated their prices. Chinese mills have been heavily squeezed, and now they have no choice but to lower their prices as well. The total number of bags directly sold by various factories, such as Fu Fu, in the market has increased to over 5,000. Because Japanese flour and domestic flour have already been depreciated repeatedly, wood customers still want to push prices down further, while sellers are adamant about selling, creating a standoff between buyers and sellers. It is reported that Feng Feng flour is only selling for 13.6-13.7 yuan, but there have been no formal transactions.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trade in new wheat was still quiet. The supply from Hongkou is increasing daily. It is rumored that domestically stored wheat will also be transported to Shanghai in large quantities, but this matter is still being worked on. Those holding goods are under pressure from the environment and are forced to sell at a loss. It is reported that Chinese mills can receive 2,000-3,000 bags per day, at a price of around 20 yuan. Japanese mills are buying at less than 18 yuan, a difference of more than 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance, Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand is Sufficient to Offset</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was stable yesterday. HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to tighten, due to the persistent speculation by Chinese banks and speculators. With a slight difference in supply and demand, prices softened slightly. The opening this morning was quite flat. Later, due to foreign firms settling accounts for foreign rice and strong demand from HSBC and Chinese banks, the US dollar reached 6.0625 yuan. At one point, the forward September US dollar rate fell below 6 yuan, to 5.96875 yuan. The market was extremely stagnant, with few discussions or transactions. Therefore, the closing price was the same as the afternoon price: 3 875/10,000 of a British gold pound and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar. The futures market was also the same.</p>
<p>Foreign rice still has to be settled</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the exchange rate was stable, with no change in the British rate against the US dollar, and stable for Shanghai. The US dollar fell two points against the British pound and was stable for Shanghai; there was no market for the French currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices by banks were 3 890625/10,000 of a British gold pound and 6.09375 yuan for the US dollar, both flat compared to last Saturday's close. After the opening, the market was calm. Foreign firms and Chinese businesses first offered HSBC the US dollar for this month at 6.09375 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese banks also bought the US dollar for this month from foreign firms at 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also unchanged. Afterwards, foreign firms suddenly had needs, and foreign rice settlements were made to American banks, softening the US dollar to 6.0625 yuan. At the same time, Chinese banks and HSBC absorbed the US dollar from American banks for the same month at 6.0625 yuan, and Chinese speculators also purchased the US dollar for the distant month. HSBC and others sold the speculators the September US dollar for 5.96875 yuan. By noon, buying and selling were still balanced, with no changes. As a result, the British gold pound was 3 875/10,000, and the US dollar was 6.0625 yuan, with the British pound tighter by 0.015625 and the US dollar narrower by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening. The futures market was soft.</p>
<p>Sparse Transactions in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market remained stagnant throughout the afternoon, with few transactions. The spot and futures prices for both the British and American currencies were the same as the afternoon closing prices: 3 875/10,000 of a British gold pound and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar. The August British gold pound was 3 859375/10,000 and the US dollar was 6.00 yuan. Compared to the closing prices of last week, the US dollar spot and futures prices were tighter by 0.03125, while the British gold pound was softer by 0.015625.</p>

<h3>Amid Scattered Buying, the Gold Market Advances to a Peak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for cash (烚赤) continued the firm trend of the previous weekend, hovering around 5,400 yuan. Because new buyers were quite enthusiastic, those selling at high prices were mostly those without the strength to hold on. Therefore, prices looked like they would rise to a new peak. The market opened 23 yuan higher, at 5,355 yuan. At the opening, silver firms immediately came in to buy, rising to a high price of 5,420 yuan. Although gold firms and money changers offered to sell in between, slightly lowering prices, silver firms continued to buy without reservation. The afternoon close was still at 5,382 yuan. The market was slightly quieter in the afternoon, but prices were extremely stable. The highest price after the opening was 5,392 yuan, but it was lowered by money changers who released their holdings, falling to 5,378 yuan. However, the close was at 5,383 yuan, an increase of 51 yuan compared to last Saturday. Trading was still active throughout the day, with approximately 3,000 taels traded. The price of gold ornaments at silver shops remained unchanged, and the price of customs gold remained the same.</p>
<p>Cash (烚赤) Up 50 Yuan</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, the price per tael (ten taels) initially had good sentiment due to reports that the Ministry of Finance would issue new bonds, rising by 23 yuan. Gold firms first sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,355 yuan. Afterwards, as the exchange market weakened, the buying sentiment became even stronger, and silver firms and gold firms rushed to buy, soon rising another 65 yuan. Silver shops sold tens of taels to silver firms at 5,420 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market rebounded, and scattered buyers sold at the high price, and a certain money changer also sold off, soon falling 50 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to money changers, falling to 5,370 yuan. Afterwards, as the foreign exchange market tightened again, buying sentiment rose again, and securities firms and silver firms bought one after another, rising back to 5,395 yuan. Before the close, the price fell again by 13 yuan due to floating buyers selling and a decrease in buyers. Gold firms made 20 taels with each other, closing at 5,382 yuan. The afternoon opening was slightly higher, with money changers buying 10 taels from gold firms at 5,390 yuan. It then rose another 2 yuan, with silver firms buying 30 taels from gold firms at 5,392 yuan. Subsequently, money changers suddenly sold strongly, slightly pushing prices down. Gold firms sold 30 taels to silver firms at 5,378 yuan. Afterwards, silver firms bought again, raising the price by 5 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver firms at 5,383 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, the price increased by 51 yuan compared to the previous day. There was strong demand after the close, and the price was raised to 5,390 yuan, with no sellers. There was a fluctuation of 65 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold from cash gold firms was more than ten yuan higher than 烚赤, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no sign of it opening.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Rose and Then Fell Back</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments at silver shops initially remained at 550 yuan per tael at Da Tong Heng. At 10:00 AM, it rose by 10 yuan, and at 11:00 AM, it fell back by 10 yuan. After that, there were no changes. Da Tong Heng still offered 550 yuan. The prices at Xin Tong Heng were similar to the above, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign currency market, in addition to cash 烚赤 rising by 50 yuan, the British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes was balanced, and the market price was stable. The price of American gold notes rose due to the tightening of the black market US dollar exchange rate, reaching a high of 16.56 yuan, before settling at 16.45 yuan, an increase of 5 cents compared to last Saturday. There was a slight demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose slightly. There was also a need for Singapore, Annam, Robbie, and Canadian notes, and the market prices rose uniformly. There was also a strong demand for Japanese gold notes, reaching a high of 1.232 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was balanced, and the market price was stable, remaining at 1.08 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Financial Review, Continued from Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaihuan</p>
<p>Until July 27th</p>
<p>According to the statistics for the first half of 1940, the total export value was 101.8 million yuan, of which exports to the Japanese yen bloc accounted for 60%. The total import value was 185.6 million yuan, of which imports from third countries accounted for more than 70%. Therefore, the nominal trade surplus was 16.2 million Japanese yen, an increase of 13.6 million Japanese yen compared to the same period in 1939. In reality, trade with third countries showed a large surplus of 50.3 million Japanese yen, an increase of 76 million Japanese yen compared to 1939. This surplus must be paid in foreign exchange. The surplus of approximately 67 million Japanese yen with the Japanese yen bloc was obtained in Japanese yen, which could not be used to purchase foreign exchange for military raw materials. The analysis of Japan's trade situation in the past six months is as follows (numerical unit: thousands of Japanese yen):</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Falls Slightly by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills and drafts showed a slight decline. In the morning, the discount rate per thousand yuan fell slightly to 47 yuan, and the lending rate also fell from a strong 50 yuan to 49 yuan. In the afternoon, it remained around 48 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to last Saturday. The interest rate of the Money Traders Association remained the same in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities, Type E Particularly Excited</h3>
<p>The securities black market saw some changes yesterday. In general, prices still rose. Type E was particularly favored by various firms, and demand was extremely strong. The market price rose steadily in a straight line in the morning, with the closing price in the afternoon rising by a substantial one yuan. Type A, which has always been very firm, suddenly retreated to a cold position, with absolutely no rise or fall. Type C also only improved slightly by one cent. Type E, which has always been slightly lower than Type C by four or five cents, suddenly changed to Type C being five cents lower than Type E. Therefore, mutual swapping transactions were triggered in the afternoon, slightly narrowing the market prices. The market price of Type D was cheaper than any other type, so buyers were also very active. In the morning, Ren Chang bought very strongly. De Fu, Gong Mao, Jiu Feng, and Lian Yi also participated enthusiastically. On the selling side, Yi Tai was the most, and Hu He Ji, Hong Da, Run Li, and Tong Kang also sold. But very few Type E were offered, and due to the fierce covering of short positions, prices rose by as much as 9.5 cents. Type E was still being bought in the afternoon. Companies such as Gong Mao, Ren Chang, and Jiu Feng still had demand. Fortunately, Yong Xiang, Heng Fu, Lian He, and Number 38 all sold Type E, mostly exchanging for Type C. Number 64 sold Type A, and Hong Da and Hou Da sold Type C, while retail investors bought Type D. Market prices for Type C and E eased slightly, while the others were firm. Type D was particularly strong. Today is the last day including interest, and there may be a slight rebound. The results of the day's market were uniformly trending firmer, rising from 5 cents to 6.5 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Fifty shares of Bank of China stock were traded, at a price of 64.5 yuan in legal tender, excluding interest.</p>
<p>Also, at the Public Industry Exchange Stock Market, the market opened very excited in the early morning, but the rising trend was slightly suppressed due to strong selling pressure. However, the strength of the market should not be limited to this. Even when the prices of various stocks fell back, there were still many buyers, indicating very good potential. The Shanghai Silver Company recently announced an interim dividend of 1 yuan, which was somewhat disappointing. Rubber stocks attracted relatively more attention.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Single Yarn Sales Active in the South, Double Horse Near the 1,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm, and the rising trend has resumed. This is because the actual demand in South China is somewhat more active, with 32-count single yarn being the majority. Therefore, the sentiment is rising. However, general speculators have been quiet for a long time, and seeing that the environment has improved slightly, they are particularly active in pushing up prices. Everyone is absorbing a few bags, tightening the market. In fact, everyone has goods on hand and hopes that prices will rise. If the long positions loosen their hold after profiting, there is a deep fear of a severe reaction.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn this morning continued the firm and high momentum of the previous day. There were many shouting high and raising prices. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 970 yuan. However, a large player with long positions sold off a portion, and prices fell back to 980 yuan, hovering between 82 and 83 yuan for a long time. But actual transactions by customers were not improving, and the market was stable. The closing price was 985 yuan. According to statistics, 2,235 bales were traded during the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 29 yuan. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:</p>
<p>Domestic 30, Hong Kong 305, total 2,205</p>
<p>Xiamen 10</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Purchases Still Lacking</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are slightly more active, but large transactions are still lacking. The cotton purchased by Japanese mills is paid for one month later. Although the sales of yarn are sluggish, prices rise with speculation buying which is somewhat active, but the cotton mills raw cotton still are purchasing very little. Therefore, the cotton market price is stable. The spot cotton sales situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Another message about foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was weak, due to a lack of major buyers and a good weather report from the cotton region, and some limit-down selling. As a result, domestic prices fell by four or five pounds. The Indian cotton market rose rapidly yesterday, with forecasts of an increase of more than one rupee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been very quiet recently. Mill interest is also scarce. The improvement in yarn prices is indeed a good sign. Japanese manufacturers are silent, but fellow traders have some transactions, but the amount is very small.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Various Parties Take Advantage of Low Prices to Buy, Selling Prices Mostly Rise</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Sales continued to be good. As yarn prices rose continuously and sentiment turned bullish, various parties absorbed inventory at low prices, and the market atmosphere livened up slightly. Asking prices also increased. Coarse and fine cloths and twills rose by 10 cents to 50 cents per piece, and bleached and dyed cloths rose by 25 cents to 50 cents. Demand from wholesale numbers and dye factories on this street was particularly strong, with more than 1,500 pieces traded, mostly coarse cloth and dyed gray cloth. Cantonese and Hong Kong firms bought more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and the Wen firm bought nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Overseas, Singapore and Siam bought more than 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Prices rose first and then leveled off. As a result, medium-grade fine cloth and fine twill rose by 25 cents to 50 cents per piece. High-end Dragon Head fine cloth and new ship single rose to 30 yuan at one point, but the rising momentum was excessive, and the market price fell back to 29.35 yuan before closing. Four Gentlemen serge fell from 88 cents to 87.5 cents per yard, but the market sentiment was still firm, because sales on the wood street are very strong.</p>
<p>Exports: Two hundred pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin today.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake, Sales Still Good, Prices All Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil cake market generally followed the improvement of the previous weekend, so the trend continued to rise uniformly. Although the oil market showed signs of softening at the close, there were few sellers. A total of 100 pieces of Jiaozhou new raw oil were traded. The price details are in the market price column: 300 pieces of road cargo, 100 pieces of Yantai new raw oil, 500 pieces of number brand new raw oil, 150 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 80 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 50 pieces of soybean oil, 20 units of Pudong bean oil, 50 dan of Dayou factory oil. With the potential for raw material soybeans to rise without falling, and the Fire Bureau having a favorable attitude, all parties are once again active, but the situation is not static, and transactions are not surging. Only a Xiamen firm bought 6,000 pieces of Dayou four brands at 11.95 yuan. Domestic customers inquired about 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake at 10.65 yuan to 10.7 yuan, one truck of Fei Zi cake at 10.5 yuan, and 3,000 pieces of Qing Zhong cake at 9.3 yuan to 9.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, 300 cans of tung oil were transported from Tianjin yesterday, and 1,400 tons of coconut oil were transported from Saigon to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Rises and Falls Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw tight coarse white sugar, while che white sugar was slightly softer. The association's designated spot price for 24 coarse white was 66 yuan per home owned-warehouse, an increase of 7 cents from the previous day's closing price, and 66.2 yuan per foreign owned-warehouse to 66 yuan. Transshipment cargo rose slightly, with dockside delivery at 50.07 yuan to 50.6 yuan, and delivery on August 15th from 51 yuan to 51.2 yuan to 51.3 yuan. Taikoo che white was slightly softer, with B-mark at 72.5 yuan and H-mark che red at 55.5 yuan, up 3 cents. Dutch red was 60 yuan. This factory snow white was still 66.5 yuan, number one ice was 87 yuan, Jing Ming ice was 88.5 yuan, all down 5 cents. The domestic sugar market had a narrow sales range, resulting in a lack of continued price increases.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Red and Green Tea Have Minor Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market saw European sales of common fine eyebrow green tea remain stagnant. Only German and American firms had scattered sales of red tea and shrimp eye green tea from local firms. The entire market had a total purchase of more than 200 boxes of red and green tea by Jinlong Xingcheng and Maison. The selling price of red tea was 285 yuan, and the selling price of pearl tea was from 265 yuan to 290 yuan. Market prices were trending towards stability. In addition, an American firm's lines for Feng Mei have some potential to be active.</p>
<h3>Export of Raw Silk: Nearly 50,000 Piculs for the Entire Year</h3>
<p>According to a figure from a silk industry source, from June 1st of last year to May 30th of this year, a full year's worth of Shanghai raw silk exports totaled 49,960 piculs. Among these, sales to the United States were the most numerous, accounting for approximately 60% of the total.</p>
<p>Since the start of the European war last September, the British and French trading companies in the Far East have drastically reduced their purchases, likely due to widespread unease abroad. As the European war escalated, British and French firms became even more disinterested, almost ceasing operations, causing export volumes to decline daily. Of the exports handled by the Daa Ching Trading Company, they accounted for 9,970 piculs, approximately 19.55% of the total.</p>
<p>The next highest exporter was Jardine Matheson, with 9,385 piculs, accounting for 18.79% of the total. Other trading companies exported a combined 858 piculs, representing only 1.72% of the total. Currently, some trading companies in Shanghai have changed their strategies, diverting factory silk previously bought in Shanghai to the American market. (Xiang)</p>
<h3>Metals: Large Sheets of Tinplate Hold Firm in Price</h3>
<p>Large sheets of tinplate, which are in particularly short supply on the market, are not being shipped in from overseas, and future orders are not being fulfilled. Consequently, the small amount currently available is all that can meet demand. As a result, dealers holding stock are seeking to profit from scarcity, and prices have not fallen. Although demand from drum manufacturers, locksmiths, machine factories, and yarn mills in this area is sluggish, and there is no business from Hong Kong, Tianjin, and other regions, market sentiment remains optimistic. Transactions are mostly based on the number of sheets, with both purchase and sale prices calculated per sheet. Bulk sales by the crate are rarely heard of. For example, 24-gauge tinplate sells for 32 yuan per piece (26-gauge sells for around 16 yuan).</p>

<h3>Re-copied from Old Newspapers: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (460) (See This Newspaper From the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Debunking the Myth of Immortals</p>
<p>Immortals originate from Taoism, and Taoism transmits nothing but empty and elusive matters. Lao Tzu said, "My greatest affliction is having a body." If one is afflicted even by one's own body, how can one be willing to save the bodies of others, thus burdening oneself? Therefore, stories of true immortals saving the world are often found in unofficial histories; the foolish believe them, while the wise doubt them. As for using talismanic water to cure diseases, this is even more a deceptive art, not something that true practitioners of immortality would deign to do. This trend is most prevalent in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Wu-Yue region has always revered ghosts and spirits; burning incense, chanting Buddhist scriptures, worshiping the Dipper constellation, and seeking immortality are almost ubiquitous. Temples are everywhere, and incense smoke is constantly present. Using incense ash to treat illnesses, calling it "immortal elixir," is something that elderly women in rural areas believe in and revere. "Summoning souls," known as "summoning belly immortals" in Yue, involves asking a spirit medium to invite the deceased spirit of the inquirer's family for questioning. Ignorant people mistakenly believe this to be real and shed tears. In reality, the gurgling sounds are all fabricated. In Huzhou, there is a Cao Filial Son Temple, served by an old woman who tends to the incense. Suddenly, it was rumored that a living Buddha had descended, capable of curing people's illnesses with incense ash. People flocked there incessantly. The local officials, wanting to prohibit it, were constrained by the words of the local gentry. Later, fearing that it would mislead the public and cause trouble, they finally ordered the destruction and burning of the statue. The spirit then became silent, and no other harm occurred. Last year, in Ningbo, someone built a Land God shrine by a bridge to collect incense money. The local officials, upon hearing of it, demolished the shrine and confiscated the money, to the delight of those who heard of it.</p>

<h3>At the Beginning of Man, Nature is Not Good</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Some say human nature is inherently good, while others believe it is inherently evil. However, according to psychology, I believe it is more appropriate and closer to the truth to say that human nature is not good.</p>
<p>After a baby is born, it only knows itself and nothing else, taking itself as the center of the world. In reality, it is a selfish and self-serving little animal. Later, as it grows up, it gradually learns about its mother, father, nanny, siblings, relatives, and friends. Thus, it gradually develops from selfishness and self-interest into a habit of considering others, eventually evolving into an altruistic personality. Selfishness is the starting point of a person's character, while altruism is the highest peak of a person's character development.</p>
<p>The process of personality development varies for each individual. Some people do not progress at all after birth, remaining a selfish and self-serving little fellow forever. Some make some progress but do not fully develop to the point of altruism. Still others, with emotionally mature personalities, develop to the ultimate point of altruism.</p>
<p>Therefore, the development of a person's personality is, in fact, from self-interest to altruism. Selfishness is certainly not good, but it cannot be said to be "evil." It is more appropriate to say "not good."</p>
<p>Therefore, I say, "At the beginning of man, nature is not good."</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>The Dynamic and Static of Writing</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>The style of writing has always been considered something that can only be understood intuitively, not conveyed in words. However, according to recent reports from psychologists, writing style can also be studied using scientific methods, and the results obtained are quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Psychologists generally believe that style can be divided into two major categories: dynamic and static. Any writing that uses more verbs is considered to have a "dynamic" style. People who write this type of writing are definitely active, lively, and prone to emotional impulses. Conversely, any writing that uses more static words (nouns and adjectives) has a "static" style. People with this style are more quiet, thoughtful, and relatively mature.</p>
<p>This is just a general statement. How are "dynamic" and "static" styles distinguished? Dr. David Pablo Boder, Head of the Psychology Department at Lewis Institute of Technology in the United States, recently invented a method called "Adjective-Verb Quotient (A.V.Q.)". This method can be used to accurately represent whether a piece of writing is dynamic or static using numbers.</p>
<p>The so-called "dynamic-static quotient" is not difficult to measure. Just take a piece of writing and count its verbs and adjectives. The ratio of the number of adjectives to the number of verbs is the "dynamic-static quotient." For example, if the dynamic-static quotient of a piece of writing is 50, it means that for every 100 verbs used, 50 adjectives are used.</p>
<p>Dr. Boder used this method to study various types of writing and discovered many interesting facts:</p>
<p>Scripts use the fewest adjectives, with an average quotient of only 11. Legal documents are 20. Novels are 25. Scientific works are 75. The fewer adjectives, the easier it is to read, so scientists are really not considering the readers.</p>
<p>The average dynamic-static quotient of business letters is 19, while that of private letters written by people without literary training is 22. Poetry is in the middle, with an average quotient of 36. Advertising writers love to pile up words, with a dynamic-static quotient of 78; but they are still not as good as Ph.D.s. On average, a doctoral dissertation has the most adjectives, reaching as many as 88!</p>
<p>The dynamic-static quotient of writing is greater than that of speaking because more effort is spent on deliberation when writing.</p>
<p>The dynamic-static quotient is also affected by age, but Dr. Boder has not yet drawn any conclusions about the relationship. For example, the writer Emerson kept a diary for more than 50 years. According to Dr. Boder's research, he liked to use more adjectives when he was young than when he was old. The former was 59, while the latter was 37. The philosopher William James, when he was in his forties, used more adjectives in letters to women than in letters to men, but when he was in his sixties, the opposite was true - there were more adjectives in letters to men.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Three Types of Columns</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, many new terms have appeared in newspapers and publications. The most common of these is "Fifth Column," which refers to all kinds of internal traitors. With the outbreak of this European war, the Germans made extensive use of the "Fifth Column" to disrupt small countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway, occupying these countries with lightning speed. Even the French surrender can be attributed not to a lack of military strength, but to the activities of the "Fifth Column" in France, as British politicians have pointed out.</p>
<p>Since the "Fifth Column" has such terrifying destructive power, all neutral countries in the world could not help but feel uneasy and thought of using columns to resist columns. In addition, Germany had long harbored ambitions for South America and was particularly jealous of the United States' support for democratic countries. To prepare for any attacks, the United States created the "Sixth Column." The Sixth Column first appeared in Philadelphia, where Dr. Kagan, the local police and medical superintendent, first advocated gathering retired soldiers and firefighters to form special groups, calling them the "Sixth Column," dedicated to annihilating the "Fifth Column" and safeguarding national interests. These groups are supervised by retired officers from the army, navy, and air force and have military discipline. Once approved by the U.S. Department of the Army and Congress, the Sixth Column will be popularized throughout the country.</p>
<p>Similar to the U.S. "Sixth Column," the United Kingdom also has a group to prevent espionage, called the "Silence Column." Its job is also to guard against enemy propaganda activities, and it is organized by young, capable personnel. However, recently, because its scope of activities was not large, it was temporarily suspended and will be expanded into an active column.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Without Descendants</h3>
<p>— Qian Meizhang</p>
<p>"There are three unfilial acts, and the greatest is to have no descendants." I think everyone can understand that these two sentences mean that not having a son to continue the ancestral bloodline is unfilial. The Chinese people value the concept of succession, and it is commendable in terms of encouraging childbirth and strengthening the nation. However, merely increasing the population without planning for good education cannot compete with others in this era of survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>I believe that the explanation of the two words "without descendants" is not so simple. I once discussed it with a friend, whose views were more sophisticated. He said: Not educating children is called "without descendants." What is the point of "filial piety" or "having descendants" if one merely has children but cannot cultivate them to be useful talents? How few of them do not disgrace their ancestors?</p>
<p>Huo Sang Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Final Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Several Guesses</p>
<p>Huo Sang said, "I want to go and see my client, Jiang Anna, first to confirm the facts we know. Since you suspect Yu Gantang, you might as well go and see him first."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Okay, he is studying at Jiangnan University, I think it will be easy to find him."</p>
<p>"One more thing, you can check who was on duty here at night. Maybe we can get some information about the black car Lao Mao saw and the people who came in and out of here."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou agreed, walked out of the guest room, talked with Li Zhifan upstairs for a while, and then returned to the reception room. Then Huo Sang locked the iron box and desk drawers and handed the keys to Ni Jinshou. When we walked out of the Wang family gate, I saw that police officer number ninety was still standing there. Huo Sang asked Ni Jinshou to remove the police officer, and also asked the police officer if a young man had uncovered the sheet covering the corpse when the body was carried out just now.</p>
<p>The police officer said, "Yes, there was indeed a guy in a suit standing in front of the car carrying the body just now. I thought he was an idler watching the excitement, so I didn't pay much attention. But I didn't see him uncover the sheet."</p>
<p>Huo Sang didn't ask any more questions, but whispered a few words to Ni Jinshou, and they agreed to notify each other if there were any developments. As we got into the car, Ni Jinshou and police officer number ninety-nine also got into the car and went to Datong Road.</p>
<p>After Huo Sang started the car at the steering wheel, he was very silent, as if he was concentrating. He was quite skilled at driving. He had experienced steep and winding mountain roads in the interior before, and he had never had any accidents. At this moment, he was driving on a flat and smooth road, and the traffic was not very crowded, so it seemed that he didn't need to be so nervous. I thought his thoughts were obviously still focused on this suspicious case. I opened the car window and inhaled some fresh air that had been filtered by the sun. Because I had stayed next to the tragic corpse for more than two hours, and added to the complicated and tangled case, my mind was also a little dizzy.</p>
<p>After a while, I asked, "Are we going to see Jiang Anna?" Huo Sang nodded, but didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Do you know her address?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she said it's number 306, Kangning Apartment." After he finished this simple answer, he was silent again.</p>
<p>I always felt a little impatient, and after a while, I couldn't help but ask, "What questions do you plan to confirm when you see Anna?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang still replied briefly, "There are many questions."</p>
<p>I still tried to coax him to talk more. "The exact relationship between the four men is definitely the main topic you want to investigate. Right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but there are others."</p>
<p>"What? Give me an example." (Sixty)</p>

<h3>The Importance of Set Design in Costume Dramas</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>The Golden Star Company, which everyone has been anticipating, is said to have decided that its maiden work will be "Li Xiangjun," starring Shu Shi and Gu Lanjun. This, of course, is still a costume drama. But we are not disappointed because it is a costume drama. Under the condition of correct awareness, costume dramas are still worthy of our welcome.</p>
<p>In the past, costume dramas were mostly crudely made, which is undeniable! The so-called folk tale films, in a short period of five, six, or ten days, can actually produce a film that must undergo a long period of research and preparation. This is an innovation in the world of cinema, and perhaps there will be no successors? Therefore, the content and results can be imagined. Set design, which occupies an important position in costume dramas, is undoubtedly unspeakable!</p>
<p>Before Cecil B. DeMille prepared to make the historical film "Cleopatra," with his outstanding talent and rich experience, he seemed to be more than capable. However, how cautious was he? In terms of set design alone, he collected a large number of historical books in the research department of Paramount Pictures and other various libraries, and consulted more than 100 kinds of personal collections to study the various etiquette, customs, clothing, architecture, weapons, utensils, and jewelry of ancient Rome and Egypt. He believed that the importance of set design in a film is no less than that of every actor in the film, and costume dramas cannot ignore this point.</p>
<p>He said: "In the play, if you want to depict Caesar issuing an order or sending a letter, what kind of thing should you use to write the order and the letter? Also, if you want to show a maid needing to relax, can you use a piano? But at that time, paper and pianos had not yet been manufactured!" Therefore, in order to be realistic, no matter how small the scene or screen is, even just a hairpin, he has to consult and explore with historians, antique experts, painters, and screenwriters in detail. In this way, he spent more than eight months of detailed preparation, from 9:00 in the morning to 11:00 every night, to complete the script, actors, set design, and various arrangements before he dared to start filming.</p>
<p>Here, we can see the importance of set design in costume dramas. It is not only for decoration and beauty, but also can even determine the fate of the entire film. In fact, we certainly cannot be as serious as Cecil B. DeMille, but it is impossible to succeed if things are mismatched, making people feel uncomfortable, or if things are simplified and mistakes are simply carried on. Therefore, I ask the filmmakers to consider the above. At the same time, I also hope that other filmmakers who make costume dramas will be cautious in doing things.</p>
<h3>Golden Star Hosts Colleagues</h3>
<p>After the establishment of Golden Star Film Company, it specially hosted colleagues, cinema operators, and film merchants from Nanyang and various domestic ports at the Red Cotton Restaurant the night before last. More than a hundred guests attended, and were cordially entertained by Wu Zhengjue, Feng Xizui, Zhou Jianyun, and others in charge of the company. At the banquet, Chairman Zeng Wanpu of Golden Star Company first expressed his welcome and gratitude. Then, manager Wu Zhengjue gave a speech, saying, "Golden Star is just starting out, and its human and material resources are very weak. It needs the support of colleagues and sages from all walks of life. The establishment of Golden Star is entirely for business purposes, and it hopes to make a small contribution to the film industry through this." On the night, film industry giants from Shanghai gathered together, which was a rare grand event in the film industry recently.</p>

<h3>How to Make Movies? (1)</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>The history of the production of movies is not very long, but because scientists continue to research and invent, movies are progressing day by day; silent films, sound films, color films, and even stereoscopic films that will soon be realized, all follow one after another. Movies have now become an important tool for mass entertainment. It can be said that many people still feel very vague about the principles of ordinary people's lives and the methods of shooting movies. The author is willing to give a brief overview of the general aspects of shooting movies, and contribute to readers who are interested in this issue.</p>
<p>(1) Cross-section of the Photography Studio: To make a film, the first thing you need is a very large photography studio, hundreds of meters long and wide, made of steel frames and glass. In this photography studio, you can use skills and scenery to create the scenes required in the film, such as living rooms, houses, or high mountains and seas. The floor of the photography studio is extremely strong, so that hundreds or even thousands of actors can stand on it, or groups of cattle and sheep, heavy vehicles, etc. can come and go without collapsing. Next to the photography studio, there are mostly rest rooms, dressing rooms, arrangement rooms, carpenter rooms, etc. for the actors, which also occupy a large area.</p>
<p>(2) Source of Light: Making a film is like taking a photo, requiring a lot of light. The source of light can be the sunlight coming in through the glass windows on the roof, but in ordinary filming, most of the time artificial light is still used, because the intensity of artificial light can be changed freely and is easy to control. There are two types of equipment for providing artificial light: the first is the arc lamp, and the second is the mercury lamp. Both of these lamps can emit extremely strong light. The arc lamp device is either a collection of several units of arc lamps, placed on a four-wheeled vehicle, or it is like a searchlight, installed on a movable steel frame. When shooting large scenes, sometimes as many as thirty or forty arc lamps are required, each with a light intensity of 500 amps and a brightness of 10,000 candlepower. Working under such strong light, the actors' eyes are of course easily damaged. To avoid this, a lead glass is usually placed in front of the lamp, which can absorb harmful ultraviolet rays. The brightness of the mercury lamp is also very strong, but it is very soft, does not harm the eyes, and is more economical than the arc lamp. This type of lamp can also be used in ordinary households, but there is one drawback, which is that under the light of the mercury lamp, the skin of people's faces appears grayish-white, which is not very good, but for filming movies, this is not an obstacle at all.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Black Paradise"</h3>
<p>— Sha</p>
<p>"Black Paradise" is another work by Wu Cun after "New Hell" with contemporary society as its backdrop. It depicts a simple and innocent girl who, unwilling to bury her future in this evil society, resolutely leaves her sister to live a wandering life. Here, the various aspects of the so-called "Black Paradise" isolated island are set off. Zhou Xuan plays a wandering street girl, which can be said to be the most suitable for her personality. Lan Lan plays a dancer who is seduced by vanity and eventually loses her life, which is quite suitable for her job. Jia Nong does not lose his experienced true colors this time, and the rest are mediocre.</p>
<p>"Black Paradise" does not have the relaxed and satirical scenes of "New Hell" that can make the audience shed tears after a burst of laughter. On the contrary, some places are too contrived, such as the scene where Xiuli does not recognize the glass window and wants to grab the food in the window with her hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the rush, the editing is very messy, and the light in some places is not clear. The ending with Lao Gong jumping into the Huangpu River is very inappropriate in my opinion. According to Lao Gong, he is a person who knows how to return when he is lost, and he also believes that Shanghai is a "Black Paradise" and cannot stay any longer. Then why does the director not give him a positive and bright future, but instead makes him commit suicide passively?</p>
<p>Yao Li has been very popular on the radio recently. This time, she was introduced by Zhou Xuan and played a song, and several close-up shots of her face were not bad, but unfortunately she did not have a role to play.</p>
<p>In short, "Black Paradise" is a more conscious and worthwhile film. Finally, I hope that the directors and producers will not blindly focus on business-minded folk films, but for the future of the Chinese film industry, they can shoot more films that are more meaningful than "Black Paradise" and "New Hell."</p>
