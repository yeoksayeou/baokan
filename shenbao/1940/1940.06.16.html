<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴黎陷落後</h3>
<p>最近歐洲戰事迅速發展的結果，德軍終於侵人了巴黎。這可以說是現行歐戰中第二階段的結束。這次歐戰，開始於去年九月，但在最初七個月中，除了波蘭戰事迅即解決以外，西綫方面，十分沉寂，這是戰事的第一階段。直到本年　月九日，德軍突向西北開始閃電攻擊，侵入丹麥挪威，五月十日，又侵人荷蘭比利時和盧森堡，强行假道，以攻法國北部，這是戰事的第二階段，而以巴黎之被侵入爲其尾聲。在德軍的西進攻略戰中。丹麥不戰而屈服，比利時王中途投降，荷蘭挪威。則皆停止抗戰於王室出亡之後，其所加於德國的阻力甚小。這次巴黎的陷落，情形當然不同。法軍的撤退，是有計劃的轉移陣地，法國政府當局，也已重申抗戰到底之決心。所以巴黎的失守，固然可以說是歐戰第二階段的結束，緊接着，也就是歐戰第三階段的開始。</p>
<p>巴黎的陷落，對於德國，當然有若干利益。第一，在增進戰鬭精神上，這不能不說是一大收穫。第二，在外交關係上，最近德軍在巴黎區作戰的順利進展，是促成義大利加入歐戰最重大的因素。墨索里尼深恐德國假如獨力戰勝英法，勢將降低義　地位，所以在巴黎失守的前夜，毅然對英法宣戰，圖分德國之功。存在於德義間的矛盾，固然不能因義大利參戰助德而遂告消滅，但是義大利的參戰，對於德國，畢竟是有所裨益的。第三，在經濟上，巴黎盆地，是法國最重要的農業區域。盛產食糧；法國最重要的煤田，也位於北方，法此交界處的諾特和英法海峽旁的加萊兩地。年的產煤三千三百萬噸，占全國總產量百分之六十五；至於工業方面。則里爾利盧昂。是法國紡織業中心，勒哈佛相加萊，是法國西岸的要港；現在以上各地，都被德軍所占，對於法國、打擊頗甚。第四。在軍事上，巴黎的陷落，就英國說，是德軍完成了對英國東南部大包圍的形勢，從此德國的空軍和潛艇，可利用法國西北部爲根據地，以進襲英國；就法國說，則馬奇諾防綫的後方，將有遭德軍侵入之危，現時里姆斯城（在巴黎東北）的德國裝甲師，正以全力南攻，其目的，即在切斷馬奇諾防綫和法國中部主力軍的聯繫。</p>
<p>目前協約國方面，特別是法國的處境，誠然困難萬分，但是　非絕望。世人也許將因巴黎陷落，而對於法軍今後能否繼續作戰，發生疑問。實則法軍的局部戰敗。雖是事實，但毅然不戰而放棄巴黎。不能不謂爲具有戰略上的理由。巴黎附近的地形，是一個大盆地，由比法邊境直趨巴黎，步步低落，自高臨下，易攻難守；更越巴黎而南，則又級級上升，易守難攻。現代戰爭以消滅對方的主力爲決定的勝利，亦即保全主力而能繼續作戰，則雖敗未敗。所以聯軍總司令魏剛將軍的放棄巴黎，改守巴黎以南，母寗可解釋爲避害而就利；而法軍的後撒，旣非主力消滅，亦非崩潰，即應估定之爲一種戰略上的轉移。巴黎的東北西北和正北，比較無險可守；但是巴黎的西南，却有諾曼台山地和不列顚尼山地；巴黎的東南，又有佛柔侏羅兩山；巴黎的正南，就是所謂中央高地區；這些盡是險峻的所在。現時佛柔和諾曼台兩山，正構成了法軍東西的兩翼，退便扼守，進也可以用爲反攻的根據地。所以隨着時間的前進，法軍形勢，尙有由穩定而漸人佳境的可能。以上是專就法德戰局論。此外：（一）義大利的參戰，主戰塲將在地中海上，英法的地中海艦隊，力量相當强大、加之近東諸國，又多較與英法接近，故英法對義優勢，並未動搖；至於法義邊境，爲　爾帕斯山地，層峯疊嶺，大規模的戰事不易展開，對於法國後方安全，不成重大威脅。（二）海洋的控制權，至今仍絕對握於英法之手。換言之，就是英法可以自由取得海外一切人力物力的補充，這種便利，爲德義所沒有。（三）更重要的。是美國對於英法的援助，日趨積極。當義大利對英法宣戰之日·美總統羅斯福氏即公開聲明決加緊以物質上資源援助與暴力對抗之國家，其後在答覆法總理求援之覆文中，又重申此項諾言。美國製造的飛機軍火，正大量源源東運。——以上三點，都是有利英法的重要因素。</p>
<p>七十年來，巴黎已是第二度被德軍侵入了。當一八七一年時，法國內的政情之混亂，外交形勢之孤立，遠過今日，結果終能克復種種困難，從血淚中復興。今日的法國，固然艱苦萬狀，但是內則上下一心，外有英國的駢肩作戰和美國的同情援助，只要勿餒勿怠，繼續奮鬥，則法蘭西民族猶應有其偉大而光明的前途。</p>

<h3>希特勒　侈談和平　謂對美洲大陸　並無侵略慾望</h3>

<p>記者繼提及「第五縱隊」之問題、希氏答稱、所謂第五縱隊、根本幷不存在、希氏一再申明「德國已獲得勝利、因其軍事組織健全、領袖超越、」</p>
<p>記者繼詢德國是否準備毀滅英帝國、希氏答曰、渠絕無此種意念、余曾一再提出提議、要求以平等待遇德國、幷要求收回德國殖民地、倫敦方面雖屢次申稱欲消滅德國、分化德國、但余對英國絕未作同樣之言論、待弗朗特戰事之後、英國政治家面帶憂戚、要求美國援助、謂德國欲毀滅英帝國、其實目前戰事將加以毀滅者、僅犧牲數日萬生命而獲致私利之資本主義集團而已、此次戰事將毀滅英國對海洋之控制、而增進各國之幸福、吾人理想中之海洋自由、爲非交戰國家間在海洋內自由往來、不受任何國家之按制、</p>
<p>希氏繼稱、德國對於地中海區域、並無領土或政治之利益、英法兩國要求獨覇世界、而各國已逐漸認識本國之權利、而拒絕此項要求突、</p>
<p>德國之和平目標爲恢復和平、德國並未對英法宜戰、而英法兩國以可笑之籍口、對德國宜戰、未來和平之基礎、爲承認眞正之和平條件、在討論列强生存攸關之問題、和平不能以條的爲保證、而應調整各國關係加以保證、倘協約國因軍事之失敗而加速理知之勝利、則此次戰事之重大犧牲、並非徒然矣、（十五日海通電）</p>

<h3>克服危難艱苦奮鬥　努力者必獲勝利　今日總理蒙難紀念　各界沉痛紀念停止儀式　巿黨部三靑團朂勉同胞</h3>
<p>今日爲總理廣州蒙難第十八週年紀念日、經中央規定、六月十六日總埋廣州蒙難及十月十一日倫敦蒙難兩紀念日、合併移於九月九日總理第一次起義紀念日同時舉行、本市各界、雖不舉行儀式、但各界仍一致靜默、沉痛紀念、市黨部·三民主義靑年團·等分別發表吿民衆書、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>效法總理　爭取勝利</p>
<p>今日爲國父廣州蒙難紀念、本市各界、以滬地環境特殊、故並不舉行任何紀念儀式、惟回憶總理於十八年前之今日、因陳逆炯明叛變、在廣州蒙難達五十餘日、雖處境危險萬分、但卒能沉毅不屈、故各界除沉痛紀念外、決效法總理大無畏精神、努力抗戰建國工作、爭取最後勝利、完成獨立解放、</p>
<p>巿黨部勉　巿民奮鬬</p>
<p>上海特別市黨部爲總理廣州蒙難紀念、發吿市民書原文略稱、我們在這世界大局急趨惡化時候、我國抗戰、正自相持階段、進入艱苦反攻的時期、尤其是我們在這惡勢力包圍中的孤島上來紀念第十八屆的國父蒙雌紀念、覺得更有嚴重的意義、</p>
<p>革命叛徒　終於失敗</p>
<p>我們想到當時國父在韶關誓師北伐以後、革命軍一鼓攻下贛州、方期直指南昌、越江北進、那裏知道、經過國父一手提拔肩荷革命重任的軍人陳炯明、竟率部叛變、企圖危害國父、來阻止北伐的進展、來摧殘革命的成功、可是隨着時代的進展、妨礙革命的叛徒、終於失收、而北伐偉業、也在一度挫折之後、終於順利進展而達到成功的地步了、</p>
<p>偉大人格　喚醒國魂</p>
<p>在那個時候、國父因爲陳炯明變起肘腋、一時憂勞困苦、有非常人所能想像而得、可是他登兵艦、與叛軍相持、達五十多天之久、始終不爲暴力所屈、國父在蒙難之中所表演的不畏强權、不畏暴力、艱苦奮鬭的精神、以及守法盡責、不肯輕棄職守、生死成敗、均非所計的決心、實足以拯救中國垂死的國魂、而促進革命的成功、從此以後、全國國民、才曉得國父那種艱苦爲國的精神、而翕然傾向於中國國民黨、</p>
<p>今昔情勢　如出一轍</p>
<p>我們又想到每當革命艱苦的過程之中、總有叛國者、起於肘腋之下、以前的陳炯明、現在的叛徙們、眞是如出一轍、可是陳逆的叛變、因國父的堅忍强毅、陳雖一時倖勝、而終於覆滅、北伐大業、雖一時被阻、而終於成功、而現在叛徒的叛變、因爲總裁的英明果斷、終於一籌莫展、並且陳炯明的罪惡、在勾結北洋軍閥、阻撓國民革命、而現在的叛徒却竟敢在强寇深人、國家民族、巳至生死關頭的時候、簽訂密的、出賣國家民族但是國父的人格、以陳逆的謀害而愈顯其偉大、革命的宏業、也以陳逆的摧殘而速其進展、這豈是心勞日拙者的始料所及、現在全國上下、對於抗戰必勝、建國必成的信念、並未因叛徒的甘爲鷹犬而動搖、精誠團結、敵愾同仇的精神、並未因叛徒的靦然傀儡登塲而渙散、這又豈是他們的始料所及呢、</p>
<p>寳貴敎訓　令人興奮</p>
<p>那時國父自蒙難以後、由粵至滬、曾發表宣百、結語說「凡忠於民國者、則引爲友、不忠於民國者、則引爲敵、義之所在、幷力以赴、危難非所顧、威力非所畏、務完成中華民國之建設、俾國民皆蒙福利、責任始盡、」又致本黨同志書、結語說、「疾風然後知勁草、盤根錯節、然後辨利器、凡我同志、此時尤當艱貞蒙難、最後勝利、總歸於最後之努力者、」這不是我們現在最寶貴的敎訓嗎、</p>
<p>擁護總裁　繼續努力</p>
<p>所以我們在今天沉痛紀念國父的蒙雜、必須效法國父克服危難的大無畏精神、必須確信三民主義是救國南針、必須擁護最高領袖蔣總裁的指導、必須擁護抗戰建國的國策、艱苦奮鬭、繼續努力、那末最後的勝利、一定是屬於我們的、</p>
<p>三靑團發　告靑年書</p>
<p>三民主義靑年團上海支團　發吿上海靑年書謂、全市靑年們、今日是國父廣州蒙難紀念、這次國父的蒙難、是反革命大集團北洋軍閥雖是處心積慮企圖消滅革命勢力、而終歸失敗、於是他們便利用革命隊伍裏的內奸、來危害</p>
<p>革命領袖</p>
<p>實現他們消滅革命勢力的迷夢、雖是革命勢力被這一個毒辣陰謀而遭遇到極大的阻撓、但革命事業、必由艱辛中幾經磨鍊、才得完成、所以革命份子的不顧一切艱難、繼續不斷的努力、使</p>
<p>革命勢力</p>
<p>更普遍而深入到中國的每一個角落、終究把叛逆份子撲滅了、一切軍閥勢力也相繼崩潰了、今日日閱、在革命戰士英勇抵抗而無法實現其以武力征服中國、父收賣了民族的敗類、革命的叛徒、企圖分化我們的革命力量、動搖我們的抗戰陣綫的當兒、我們來回憶國父廣州蒙難的歷史敎訓中、祇要我們</p>
<p>不顧艱辛</p>

<h3>華方宣傳品　銷售虹口一帶　日領署警察部捕獲一人　虹口警權交還未見實行</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日文「上海每日新聞」載稱、華籍小販一名、在虹口區向日兵鉗售華方宣傳品、星期四日午後在吳淞路被日領署警察捕獲、該小販名蔣文琪、（譯音）住江西路、吿日警察謂、渠受上海反日份子指使、携印有華軍活動照相之明信卡售予日軍官兵、被補時、抄出是項明信卡百餘張、日領署警察部刻正探零被捕者之指使人、</p>
<p>盜案增多</p>
<p>工部局對於蘇州河北之虹口區域警權、自日軍橫加阻擾、至今不能實施、以致一切罪犯、均以此為　逃藪、自本年三月一日董事會與日本領事館協商結果、徇日方要求、成立協定、以E區區長由日人任之、將警權完全交由工部局實施、但至今已三越月、此事仍未見諸實行、一般居民、深以增多盜案爲可慮、</p>
<h3>日本求和目的　乃在應付政潮　國內醖釀倒閣運動　又欲利用歐局自肥　中國堅持抗戰政策</h3>
<p>大陸報云、最近期密勒氏評論週報載稱、東京方面深恐中國戰事拖延過久、日政府內部或將發生暴力大政變乃派非正式代表赴香港、妄圖與中政府代表媾和談話、</p>
<p>嚴重事件　正在進展</p>
<p>日本方面因經濟困難、及現任首相米內未能結束中國「事變、」故政局不寗、或將釀成重大政潮、其性質及意義之重要、或可與一九三六年日陸軍下級軍官革命、殺害岡田等閣員之著名二·二六事件相比擬、再、日本亟欲乘歐局以自肥、特中國戰爭賡續不已、乃一重大阻碍、日本苟能自由行動、或已決定與希特勒及墨索里尼狼狽爲奸矣、</p>
<p>詆斥政府　對華戰事</p>
<p>日軍閥今方垂涎於香港·新加坡、尤其是荷屬東印度、然中國戰爭長此不已、日閥殆未敢開始新冒險、至是該文臚舉近頃日本政局發生具有重大意義之事件、並謂、政友會與民政黨正圖重振旗鼓、干與政府政策、而本年初日本國會集會、即有對官方政策、尤其關於中國戰事之政策、力加詆斥者、此在日本國會、巳久未聞矣</p>
<p>政黨一致　反對軍閥</p>
<p>日本近已開始成立唯一政黨之運動、由前首相近衛任黨魁、是項運動之內在動機、厥爲敵對政黨欲團結一致、反對軍閥、蓋目下軍閥大權獨攬、其無的束的政策、乃解決「中國事變」之最大障碍也、久巳擁護「一國一黨」計劃之久原氏辭去內閣顧問官一職、或將促成危局之勃發、</p>
<p>中國外交　政策不變</p>
<p>大中社記者昨在某處適與新近由港至滬之西人某君相晤、乘便詢以在港時、對於日本和平攻勢有所聞吾、承答、本人在港友人中、不乏華籍知名之士、彼等均謂自前年十二月以後、重慶政人物中、巳無斯謂主和論者妄自主張、一致堅持抗戰國策、非至日軍撤出中國、絕不望和、彼等常謂重慶黨政要人、均信守一個外交政策、即以自中立塲、爭取國際上之多面援助、並不絕對偏於其一方面以自束縛、轉使多助變爲寡助、是黨政要人中、確不乏深知日本者、常以研究日本所得之結論、貢獻於最高領袖、然其結論、則恰爲指出日本國力日衰之實情、助長抗戰勝利信心者、某君復謂、本人此次在港、與華籍某名流　別時、曾因談及歐戰問題、而引起某名流評論中日問題之興趣、彼謂日本在此時期、極欲拔出陷於對華戰爭中之泥足、以尋求上次大戰中所遇之美景、然又無徹兵出中國之勇氣、故不斷散播和平消息以自慰、結果適增煩惱而已、</p>
<h3>租界中立性　永不變動　一切陰謀均粉碎</h3>
<p>本埠因意國參戰而引起之杌隍狀態、因各國駐軍之力謀租界安全、成立協定、互相切實遵守且進而作種種可能之努力後、不特陰霾盡掃、近日來之事實、亦已證明上海租界之中立性、業已確立、一切流言蜚語、及別有用心者之挑剔破壞、亦大抵自生自滅、一般均漠然置之、</p>

<h3>銀錢業辦決算　循例休假兩天</h3>

<h3>電話公司　無加價說　去年頗多盈餘　局方接聲請</h3>
<p>邇來外傳本埠電話費有將加價之風說、一般人士、僉認電話公司業務、近年至爲發達、去年且亦頗有盈餘、似無加價之需要、如果有此擬議、其望租界當局及該公司加以考慮、不再增加居民負擔、平明社記者持以此事向工部局方面探悉、蓋以租界內公用事業之增價與否、須由工部局加以審查核准、迄今該局尙未接獲電話公司要求增加之申請、</p>
<h3>英機停航　航郵停遞　郵局已正式通吿　巴西郵包須報稅</h3>

<h3>英大館發言人　闡明對華政策　一如往昔絕未變更　上海局勢維持現狀</h3>
<p>歐戰緊張聲中、英國對於遠東所採取之政策、外傳種種、實有令人如墮霧中、更以天津白銀問題、成立協定、益費猜疑、平明社記者特此走訪英國大使館發言人、叩詢一切、經英大使　發言人、以極誠摯之態度承答如次、英國對華政策、一如　昔、毫無變更、並繼續維持在華權益、絕不放棄、目前英法正在並肩抵抗納粹侵略、與中國從事抗戰、正復相同、雖一時形勢稍受頓挫、但吾董堅信將來必能獲得最後勝利、</p>
<p>天津協定　即將公佈</p>
<p>至於天津租界白銀問題、據稱業經成立協定、並將於一星期後正式公佈、但該協定尙有釋明之必要、英國當局在現下環境中實有不得已之苦表、始作此措施、然終深信對於各方面均有裨益、天津租界當局代管之白銀總數、僅提出十分之一、售於英鎊集團地區、所獲之代價、亦將於英鎊集團地區使用、其用途限於救濟難民及其他公共事業、如築堤防災之類、一切均爲當地公益着想、</p>
<p>擅捕人犯　並無其事</p>
<p>觀於報載日本警捕得隨時入天津英租界內逮捕所謂「恐怖份子」之規定、實屬不確、據該協定、日本警務當局如發現所謂「恐怖份子」匿跡英租界及有犯罪行爲時、「得通知租界當局、迨派人調查屬實後、方得逮捕移交、此項措施、在上海租界方面、亦已實行多時、爲維持治安及免除糾紛起見、姑乃作如此措置、</p>
<p>上海現狀　無庸杞憂</p>
<p>該發言人復稱英大使寇爾爵士業已離港來滬、正在途中、二三日內、或可抵此、到滬後略事休息、逕赴華北與否、目前尙未決定、肥者復詢以歐戰擴大、義國參戰後、本埠情形、是否可慮、該發言人謂本埠現狀、不致變更、無庸杞憂、至於香港方面、互傳情形緊張、人心惶惶之說、全不可靠、神經過敏之人士、爲謠言所惑、終日惴惴、無異席人自擾、香港防務據渠所知、極其堅固、當局已籌劃凖備一切、足以抵抗任何外來襲擊、共他則並無異狀、可以奉吿也、</p>

<p>收復巴黎</p>
<p>為法蘭西復仇、在座之白髮兄弟（指退伍軍人）均屬以厚望焉、艱難之環境絕不足以損害法蘭西之精神、反之經臍練之後、光輝愈顯偉大也、法大使最後並稱、大使夫人發起爲法國紅會募捐、不數日即募集七十萬元、不僅法僑及協約國各國僑民捐助、上海各國僑民、及各界人士、對於法蘭西之抗拒搏鬥、莫不關切而樂於捐助也、世界國家、若法國者、可擔負艱難而絕</p>

<p>社開社云、滬西賭窟、一度傳於上月卅一日一律關閉、旋又盛傳將展期本月十五日、決不再行繼續、一律勒令停閉、當時一般豫料此說決不可靠、無非故意放出之空氣而已、果焉、昨日已屆期限、但各賭窟非但毫無閉歇之現象、反　　彩烈、遠勝于前、並據悉此後史有延長存在之可能、是則滬人士所期望及早肅淸此項賭窟者、現又知其自食其言矣、</p>

<h3>金融外匯英平美轉緊</h3>
<p>外滙昨日巿況、匯豐掛牌、　無更動英美匯暗巿、鬆後突緊、此因市內謠傳紛起、人心略受刺激、投機商傾向扒結、晨初以港電吐塞殊力、十時半光景、致美匯見長六元一五六二五、英金達三辦士九八四三七五、自後即有流言影響、而見轉緊、美滙曾回至六元、尚賴外滙供　頗勁、所緊有限、艮收盤又稍回平、結果英金與上日收市、不分榮辱、為三辦士九〇六二五、　滙軋緊〇六二五、為六元〇三一二五、期貨趨勢與現貨彷彿、</p>
<p>港方開盤首有塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦　條、近遠均升〇六二五、紐約銀行仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬、長〇六二五、對法未更、美對英跌半分、對滬小五分、對法吿平、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士九三七五、美滙六元〇九三七五、較七日晚收、英硬〇〇三一二五、美則仍平、開後港雷首來吐售、市面呈鬆、計港電售予外行七月期美匯五元九三七五、又六月期英金三辦士九五三一二五、滙　掛牌揭曉無上落、白銀平衡稅揭曉加百分之〇·五〇、此後外行亦滿懷供意、華商投機家曾見　進、外行七月份美滙六元、故現美滙時已吿六元一五六二五、英金達三辦士九八四三七五、迨至十一時後、市面又有謠傳、人心轉虛、華投機商繼續扒吸、價遂轉緊、計有利賣予華投機商六月份美滙六元〇六二五、以至六元、後外行塞予華投機商七月份美滙做五元九〇六二五、惟收盤尚形穩定、結果英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯六元〇三一二五、本月份央金亦三辦士九〇六二五、美匯六元、下月份英金三辦士八一二五、美匯五元八七五、比隔昨晚收、現貨英平、美緊〇六二五、本月份英平、美則軟〇九三七五、七月份英美各縮〇三一二五與〇六二五、午後週六無巿、</p>
<p>香港美匯乍緊乍鬆</p>
<p>香港十五日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤平定、惟美滙動盪不定、英滙日滙均無變動、美匯現貨緊　八七五、為二十三元、申滙現貨降三元、為三白七十四元、九時五十分仍吿動盪、美匯現貨鬆一二五、為一十三元一二五、十時二十五分平穩、美匯現貨緊〇六二五、為二十三元〇六二五、申滙現貨回升二元、為三百七十六元、十時五十分美匯現貨回鬆一二五、為二十三元一八七五、十一時三十分吿平、美滙現貨重緊〇六二五、為二十三元一二五、申滙現貨升二元、為三百七十八元、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英美俱見放長</p>

<h3>流言遍傳　金價反動</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、初時頗靜、狀似徘徊、厥後流言遍傅、匯市轉緊、激動買風、致結果吿漲一百餘元、晨開為五千三百八十元、以金號銀號兩帮力售拋空、壓低至五千三百三十元、嗣為錢兌業設券帮拉購之下、重起　五千三百七十元、惟外匯仍報鬆、致欲升不能、未幾　撳二十元、迨十一時後突來某種謠傳、經營者以消息利多、奮臂猛撈、霎時跳至五千五百十元、遂吿收盤、較十日軋好一百十五元、午後週六無市、半天交易的三千兩左右、銀樓飾金先跌後漲、結果反萵十元、海關金等　　、</p>
<p>烚顯漲一百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外匯吿鬆、人心趨疲、惟某錢兌業尚稍有納胃、故開市祇撳十五元、錢兌業進銀號二十兩、為五千三百八十元、嗣金號與銀號散戶等拋空力售、雖另一銀號暨某錢兌業乘機拖入、奈斯時外　仍鬆、終感供逾於求、續又壓小五十元、銀號出金號二十兩、遜為五千三百三十元、此後匯市由鬆轉平、錢兌業銀號　加碼吸收、而賣者已漸減少、頓回升四十元、金號出錢兌業三十兩、為五千三百七十元、旋因某余號續來吐售、父撳低二十元、證券帮出金號十兩、為五千三百五十元、入從銀號帮再來搜羅、且證券帮近亦有拖進、加之其時外匯趨緊、頓引起散戶扒入、立衝出五千四百元大關、不意其時買風更強、蓋因市上謠傳利多、外滙尤軟、一般拋空者者急起抵補、迨收盤前又穿出五千五百元大關、銀號進錢兌業散戶等共五十兩、為五千五百十元作午收價、結果比上日軋漲一百十五元、收後尤堅、五千五白二十元、尚無賣戶、半天一百八十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數尤、收　減低三十元、現標金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸九百六十元、迨九時半掛小十元、十一時十五分回升十元、正午掛高十元、此後無變化、結果尚大十元、計大同行改懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收　減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣始跌繼漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤近午突漲、英美金鎊始則供求均勻、近午需要陡　、市價步漲、英金票供求平衡、市價站穩、奐金票始以巴黎陷落、賣氣殊盛、一度退至十六元零七分、後以黑市外匯轉軟、大衆需要陡增、午間高至十六元五角半、午後初仍挺俏、卒告回平、結果比上日軋漲二角半、香港票需要小弱、市價續漲三分、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均不乏需要、市價一致漲起一角、日金票及朝鮮票均有需要、前者為一元零九分、後者為九角三分半、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗港銷不懈</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、漸入盤旋之途、但華南方面、對於細粗紗需要繼續不懈、所以巴黎雖告失陷、人心未受若何影響、同時美棉轉漲、情況尤為安定、　某紗價值依然廉宜也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因外棉續升、而外滙稍鬆、致塲中人氣尚和緩、二十支雙馬開價為一千二百五十元、即刻漲至一千一百三十元、旋聞金價平平、浮多吐出、檯面稍見鬆懈、跌至一千一百十元、迨收盤時、空方抵補、人心復挺、市盤又復回升至一千一百二十三元、查半日間成交統計一千四百五十包、行情二十支　馬跌九元、今日有紗一千一百十包運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行一、一〇〇香港　三三〇寗波　二〇統計一、四五〇</p>
<h3>棉商尙在觀望</h3>
<p>本棉交易、常沉悶、惟印棉廠方稍有需要、售價殊為廉宜也、同行成交更清、大衆都抱觀望態度、所以市面仍在呆滯境中、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>平果爾一〇·〇永安進二〇〇件送廠巴西棉二五〇·〇信和進二〇件又</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因受到賣方之壓力而跌、後因大衆之購買及一部份空頭抵補、市況回堅、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起十八九磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉價格已趨穩定、然交易則靜寂異常、各方俱以美棉之步漲、樂觀者殊多、唯目前暫抱觀望態度也、一般意見、目前已至最低價、故售價不致再跌矣、</p>
<h3>紗風潮的回顧　漲得高，跌得足，都為皮球　東洋紗，本廠紗，同樣命運</h3>
<p>半年以來之紗市變遷、殊堪驚人、實則一般投機者集中孤島、利用游資充斥、作大規模之投機、造成波濤滔天、在漲暴落之局面、在本年春初、因滙兌步步趨縮、黃金日日上升、棉紗跟踪前進、此時正值春銷旺令之際、投機商心思愈濃二十支雙馬價由八百元、直漲至一千一二百元外、拋空者、鑒於香港方面需要接踵向來、頗現惶恐之象、倒閉者已有數家、空方在市塲揭貼字條、謂該市塲經營期貨不合法、一時多空兩方紛紛結價、暫吿結束、此時上面之日紗月琴價僅在九百元左右、與下面之變馬紗價相差二百元外、且　馬發生風潮、亦有倒閉索不到錢之苦、（按東洋紗在樓上買賣、華英廠紗在樓下交易、故有上面下面之稱）、一般投機者羣奔日紗市塲、去踢皮球交易矣、且日紗投機、進進出出、兩方皆無須墊頭銀、於是氣勢更熾、兩日間、一鬨漲至一千三四百元、下面雙馬紗亦跟漲至一千五百元外、五月份交割雙馬倒閉巳有多家、上面日紗交割尚無問題、因之咸向上面做輸贏、交易意外發展、查具穩定之原因、謂四月份中、廠家開出廉價之紗殊多、及套利者亦不少、市價暴騰之後、同業大都獲利、買風愈形尖銳、小資本套利心思更濃、因其有八九分至一角外之利鈿可獲、叫月份一過、漲風之劇、使人可畏、日日飛騰、一跳漲至一千八百二十五元、豈料事出常軌、盛極必衰、歐戰日形擴大、印美棉市及股票一致慘洛、於是投機商受了當頭棒、與上海方面雖無極大影響、然投機者在海外遭受虧耗外、祇得將囤貨易錢、以致償補、外匯亦係同一病態、　兌一鬆、本埠市塲一瀉千里、日紗由一千八百二十元、直跌至最近到七百八十元、不及一月差額在一千零四十元、照此情形、多方何能支持、當然倒的倒、逃的逃、沂來　載清理紗號之興繁、猶如雨後　笋也、二十支雙馬高價漲至一千八百二十五　、最低跌至九百九十元、亦跌八白零五元、　聞賺錢固然遼不少然套利者之損失亦極浩大、投機　雖處心積慮、結果為他人造機會、殊屬得小償失也、（山）</p>
<h3>證劵　統甲獨漲五分</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、適與　日形勢相反、甲種獨　、餘則均小、由市價之膠着不動、一再盤旋、即可以窺見人心　此之冷淡、及忐忑不安情形、昨日交易上午較多、久豐鴻大稍有補進、生大天豐同康稍有買進、鴻康及昌記賣出丙種不少、通記出乙種為多、午後祇四號稍有買進、零星散戶稍有賣出、交易極少、全日交易、成交約五十餘萬元、午前佔四十萬元、市價結果祇甲種略大五分外、餘均跌一二角左有茲將簡明表於伊、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商水泥股一百股，價為五十元正、</p>
<p>倫　十四日（週五）電、今日中國外債及英商遠東各公司股票掛脾行市概吿平平、上下檔各債券、均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白先疲後穩</h3>
<p>昨糖市先疲後穩、結果無甚上落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧上六十九元半、下午七十元〇三角、外棧初市跌一元、為六十九元、旋至六十九元四角、下午仍到七十元、轉口貨上午五十四元八角至五十五元二角、下午五十五元半至五十五元七角、升二角、太古車白B嘜新貨八十二元半、老貨八十二元、荷赤六十元、本廠雪白七十元半、小五角、本冰降度相同一號九十一元半、晶明冰九十三元、國糖有建幫開出太古綸到貨刁靑數百包、六十三元半、廣帮開出片靑數十桶、五十二元、</p>
<h3>愼防倒賬</h3>
<p>— 正之</p>
<p>七七事變未發生以前，本市商業，大都以　　為鐵充營業之目標，故　　端　秋節年節，必有倒賬發生，多則數十萬元，少則數萬元，其數千元者更無論矣。</p>
<p>例如戰前南市×××三聯號之倒賬，總歡　達七十餘萬元，結果僅以二三折了结。　倒賬者及被倒者，其間均以情感用事，並未以正當法律手續宜吿破產，目如被欠為數較多者，事前先行接洽，折頭加多，及至表面講賬，如倒賬者提出僅有一成賬頭，旋談判增至成半，結果或以　三成了結，被欠多數者，必即首肯，於是其餘均迎刃立解。講賬之易，無逾於此。以致陳陳　因，年年有倒賬，逢　必倒，視為家常便飯，從無澈底予以糾正者，實屬異事。</p>
<p>然則　　者之原因何在，日不外下列二稽：（一）囚　業失败，無法　持、於是不得不出於倒之一　，　倒後反可保全自己實力之一部份，以為後來再起地步。（二）因　營投機失敗，以一倒了之，結果亦興上　相仿，共間　因營业失　而能以全部賬底公開機還於償權者，眞如風毛麟角，實不多　，其甚者曰開夜潮，乘夜出走外埠，以不了了之，事後雖予警吿，或通緝，大　無補於事實焉。</p>
<p>查八一　後　值非常，銀根緊急，於是各業不得已將放賬銀期，大為縮短，或改現交者，營業雖略減少，但倒賬之事，巳絕無僅有，實為可喜之一事。由此觀之，可見雙力互以實力從事者，可以减少倒賬危險　，反這，　賬演出，自必源源而來，實難難免焉。</p>
<p>惟查去　，又有××倒賬一羣，重復搬濱一邊，總數為上餘萬元，為　非紗，考其原囚，仍係感情用事所致。蓋各氣在短期放賬及現交之外，對於××食其吃價較大，而去胃不小，遂寬共銀期，一經週轉不靈，立即搬演倒賬舊劇，甚且以折頭太少，未及講賬，竟連演開夜潮喜劇則終塲，至可歎也。</p>
<p>茲值端節方過，用將前　影事，略述一二於上，以為各業借鏡而資警惕。記者原意乃指陳非常時期營業之一得，即縮短銀期及現交以員力從事者，即可減少倒賬危險，並非欲痛斥雙方之短處，故僅將以前事實之小影，依稀略示一二，用為例證，尚希各業富局，對於此節重復加以考慮也。</p>
<h3>糧食　米價狂漲二元許　利用「統制」作背景大演雙簧</h3>
<p>洋米至昨日中市、突有強烈之變化、各貨價一律飛騰、蓋初猶以天時陰雨、人心恍惚、詎後買氣陡旺、不獨內地鄉莊去路加倍活躍、且南北洋兩幫轉口貨、亦屬　擠、一時在羣相搜羅之下、一般投機家更形活躍、倐忽之問、各色洋米價猛飛一三元之巨、一號西貢及安南粳竟喊至六十元、至此價格既高、頓與產地劇價接近、原根行客業向洋行家訂就大批二號西貢及混合碎不下二千噸、消息遍傳、人心稍挫、銷塲轉遜、開價亦見回低、收盤一號陳西貢及一號暹米均為五十八元半、火絞九十七元八角、小紋五十五元三角、東京砶尖五十五元、米茶五十三元、混合碎五十一元七角半、五十元零五角、較之前市尚暴漲二元左右、然至下午又被各方爭辦所抬高、結果仍比前晚較大二元許、小紋早市開五十四元二角後一路上騰晚收五十六元、一號西貢晚收五十八元七角、一號及暹二號均至五十七元、暹二號回籠亦自六十一元半至六十二元、一號西貢香港來路貨亦至五十七元半、惟新定西貢一二號混合碎續有二千八百噸成議、由仁記拋與米商、尚有三千順則未經成議、二號暹邏二千噸六十元〇五角尚須待復、全日回籠米成交二百多噸、現米則有一萬多包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、傳聞塲外暗盤、一般貨主以內地陳貨將罄、來源小繼、而內地運輸阻碍、謠傳某方對於米麥雜糧又有禁止出口及日用品拒絕內運之說、搬運乏利、手中各貨、更視奇貨、價盤繼續猛升二元、常幫特清粳開六十六元、蘇崑常州白粳亦須六十四五元、靑泗薄稻六十五元、南港早稻六十二元半次至六十一元半云云</p>
<p>糯米市況遂隨之激昂異常、不獨零星胃口頗濃、而大戶囤收續旺、兼之價盤低廉、最合內地鄉莊去路、並在巨額採辦、致賣方亂喊漫無標準結果金　特元計開五十二元、常丹白元五十元左右、江北貨四十八元出零、與粳尖並提二元也、</p>
<h3>粉巿明定暗堅　華粉廠有減工訊</h3>
<p>麵粉昨巿呈明定暗堅之象、查本街銷塲頗活、因十三元八角之二號粉廠盤、究屬便宜、惟各廠以目下新麥未能源源接濟、對於本街批　之不加者、實為維持性質、故不願多量犧牲、即客般售至十六元二角半、亦屬無形限制、統市各粉成交、　計約有七八千包、內地粉及回籠粉喊價為十四元四五角、但實際交易迄無所聞、</p>
<p>又訊　滬市華商各紛廠、以目下新小麥來源受阻、陳麥原料、僅敷半月之用、而粉價則欲漲不易、故巳將一部份機製暫停、暫為減工、一俟新麥湧到、再行恢復云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　新蠶豆客銷活躍　黃豆存稀續緊半元</h3>
<p>新蠶豆　因來源小旺、二則去路有汕頭·廈門·寗波·港帮等採辦、致求多供少、漲風漸熾、統計做開嘉定白皮蠶豆六百餘包、價自一十元零一角全十九元七角、北港靑皮蠶豆四百餘包、價為二十元零　角至二十元、</p>
<p>黃豆因豆餅再見挺升、（成交期現各餅二萬餘片、由汕頭帮妥去五千片外、餘均　行囤拖去、）油廠辦胃股切、出口本街亦不懈、故行情在到存兩稀之情形下、續緊半元、但成交不多、因貨戶的底積小足叫萬包、致一味緊扳、祇統共做開安慶豆二白五十餘包、蚌埠豆二車、蕪湖豆曰譜包平湖豆一百包、太倉豆一百五十包、浦　豆一百餘包及崇明沙黃四百餘包云、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有二千三百二十包、及生　二百五十包、生油三百聽、　運香港、</p>
<h3>海味　早紅蝦尾售開</h3>
<p>江北星紅蝦瓦、最近到　數十箱、以適逢去路呆滯、故未有受手、聞昨日已經　開、成盤　一百　十元、該貨身分　乾、足以久　、但市勢趨軟、比　小去十元、</p>
<h3>暹小淡巿存足</h3>
<p>暹　小淡來源無間、市存充實、惟去化平淡、前市已跌至一白六十五元、乃刻市僅售一百五十元、據一般人觀測、後市尚看續降、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日美絲價俱漲　本巿絲交甚淸　浙繭陸續抵滬</h3>
<p>最近絲市、國外絲價、日美固各見高昂、以本週初尾言、橫濱現貨漲起七十元、遠期漲八十四元、紐約近期漲一角四分、遠期漲一角三分、然其原因、並非實銷轉機、而為歐戰　法愈陷逆境、美國恐將參戰之刺激所致、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、洋行進胃停滯、外滙鬆長、內地絲蘭市價、尚難下回、故內外絲價相距三四百元、故數日來因此交清價疲云、</p>
<p>浙東繭子、繼續運來、昨日又有一百五十八包釗滬、由禮和洋行海福輪、自寗波運來、</p>

<h3>右圖係巴黎賽納河風景遠眺</h3>
<h3>歐洲何處去</h3>
<p>繁華的巴黎已陷落。西綫大戰第二期吿一段落，爲時不過十日，而法國的首都淪陷於德軍者，七十年間，今其第二次矣。歐洲！歐洲！何處是汝之歸宿！</p>
<p>溯自耶穌紀元前八百年至紀元後一千九百年，歐陸文明素最開通，即近代科學，工業及技術的發展，亦以該處爲策源地。時至二十世紀，歐陸竞成紛爭迭起，世上最不安定的一角，誠可怪也。菲洲事事落後，未起若是繁多的擾攘。亞洲素亦和平無事，直至白種人挾其囂囂不安的思想及勢力，以抵垣河及長江兩岸，局勢纔爲之改觀。世界其餘部份現有一種感想，以爲句與歐洲老死不相往來，即可獲臻歌舞昇平的樂園。</p>
<p>歐洲旣能　成偉大的文明，何以不能使其正常發展。</p>
<p>歐洲初係農業的產物。農棄在美國乃是另一種實業，即澈底開　土地之　，在歐洲，農業　生存於　土之謂，其性實各不相同。</p>
<p>美國從最初殖民起，一地小　再事耕植，即可移居他處。在歐洲舊世界則不然，自始迄今，農業業以固定的一地爲限。農民頗多世代襲居一地，達一千年至一千二百年之久者，如法國中部各省，西北部之　列塔尼及諾曼第，蘇格蘭，西班牙北部，德國西南部，及義大利西北部及中部都是。</p>
<p>就　義言之，歐洲農民多係第六至十二世紀間即住在現居之地，因而造成五六白處蕞爾領域。年復一年，從土地，氣候，及背景的密切適應中，產生歐洲種種風俗，習慣，藝術，文學，建築，政治，暨各種社會制度。</p>
<p>在　古世代，西歐已有民族產生。至一四〇〇年，英法已其民族意識。各國政治　袖應時制宜，乃能在務農的蕞爾領域之上，建立較大的體制，蜆化爲强盛之邦，而文明具備矣。</p>
<p>特中歐則未能獲此成績。西歐南歐領袖人物，圖在多腦河一大平原建立一個民族或聯邦，亦　失敗。羅馬人曾用武力創立經濟合作的雛型，未幾亦吿瓦解，良以羅馬人的軍事組織固甚强盛，但羅馬帝國漫無邊境，野蠻民族騷擾不息，即無以　其後了。</p>
<p>至是，文明乃被一掃而空。五世紀後，始有敎會以宗敎的團結爲基礎，重建中歐。以敎皇爲各種糾粉的仲裁者，以國王爲執行者。此在當時或屬最良辦法。旋有一部份基督敎徒，否認敎皇在精神上的最高權，這種制度乃吿破裂。</p>
<p>厥後歐洲人復屬　於古羅馬人的計劃。法王路易十四世及拿破崙，皆擬以良政促進商業，以鐵腕强制和平，從而組織歐洲以利法國。屢戰屢勝，併吞土地頗廣，然皆未達目的，蓋中歐民族，宗敎，利益互異，組織工作本極脆弱，一遇英俄壓力，即吿不支。</p>
<p>繼有霍亨乍侖王室，再襲羅馬人及拿破侖的故智，組織中歐，以利德國。惟一九一四至一九一八年之大戰，亦使此種企圖成爲泡影。西歐各國，一俟獲勝，即以其成見，施諸中歐，並將該處分成數國，給以共同的宗敎理想及民治信念。國際聯盟約成立，乃圖完成敎皇未竟之功，不幸國聯荏弱無能，對中歐一籌莫展，致中歐各國漸次飢饉爲息。創立國聯者對於經濟問題，似不肖一顧，乃聽任奧地利無農業，匈牙利無工業。</p>
<p>職是之故，多腦河怒浪奔騰，不起革命，即將發生戰爭。自一九一八年至一九三八年間，組織多腦河聯邦，予捷克，匈牙利，奧地利，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，保加利亞，波蘭以經濟合作及政治諒解之議，不絕於耳。第上述各國各自爲政，恣意掠奪，絕無合作之可言。它們雖不拒絕國聯借款，及國聯在　義上的勸吿，然亦以此爲止境。希特勒乃從混亂的中歐崛起矣。</p>
<p>希特勒志在建立全新的中歐，並轉移地中海及大西洋的交通，以奪取南歐各國的利益。德國爲　此目的，巳在多腦河上游及萊茵河下游之間，鑿成運河網，可供航海巨船駛行，同時建造汽車公路，聯絡匈牙利羅馬尼亞，籍以開闢貿易新路綫。德國此種計劃，大有使地中海失其國際要道之虞。此則斷非英法所能容忍。</p>
<p>希特勒與蘇聯締盟，自政治及意識觀點而論，固令人驚異，要亦其覬覦東歐的必然結果。然希　勒縱浩成貫通德國的貿易新路綫，使柏林成為中歐一切貨物的總彙，甚至設法調整蘇聯經濟，以適應德國體系，特中歐政治問題，仍未解決，必將危及德國整個計劃。</p>
<p>綜之，中歐問題根深蒂固，解決困難。德人亦多農民，對其國家膨脹甚速，而後事茫茫，實有罔然不知所終之感。大凡歐洲民族，對祖國意念模糊，其精神即趨薄弱，此即一九一三年至一九一五年拿破崙潰敗的原因。今日的希特勒是吾能不蹈此覆轍，言之尙早。</p>
<h3>歐洲史上　幾大戰役　英國確保海權　德佔陸軍優勢</h3>
<p>世界海軍，英國最强。講到陸軍，德國第一。這是古今中外婦孺皆知的事實。英國把握住海洋控制權，巳有三百五十二年的歷史，其間經過五次光榮的大海戰：</p>
<p>（一）一五八八年在英吉利海峽擊敗西班牙腓力二世派征英國的艦隊。</p>
<p>（二）一六九二年在法國北部之拉烏裕擊敗法王路易十四的艦隊。</p>
<p>（三）一八〇五年納爾遜在西班牙西南海　特狩法爾加粉碎拿破崙覬覦海權的迷夢。</p>
<p>（四）一九一六年在丹麥之遮特蘭擊敗德皇威　二世的艦隊。</p>
<p>（五）一九四〇年在挪威海岸擊敗希特勒的艦隊。</p>
<p>德國的陸軍橫行歐陸，差不多有一百九十九年光景，其間經過勝敗互見的六大戰役：</p>
<p>（一）一七四一年，腓特烈大帝在七年戰　裏大捷，普魯士軍隊嶄然露頭角。</p>
<p>（二）一八〇六年在耶拿被拿破崙擊潰。此後，普魯士即採取全國皆兵開。</p>
<p>（三）一八六六年，卑斯麥在薩多瓦大敗奧軍，普魯士逐取得統一德意志的領導權。</p>
<p>（四）一八七一年，大毛奇在普法之戰，大敗法軍，巴黎被圍十九星期，卒吿陷落。</p>
<p>（五）一九一九年盧登多夫最後總攻被英法美聯軍擊退。巴黎和的後，札克特建設新軍</p>
<p>（六）一九四〇年，希特勒在西綫擊敗　法聯軍，攻入巴黎。</p>
<h3>日本人的厭戰</h3>
<p>日本厭戰情緖，日趨明顯。日用品缺乏，尤使民不聊生。報紙紀載「民間不安」者，乃屢見不鮮。茲節錄各報言論，以窺一斑。</p>
<p>日日新聞：政府當局茍任民衆得知本國財政實况，則民衆未必如今日之惶惶不安。</p>
<p>讀賣新聞：舉國不安，恒爲內閣傾覆之先聲，此乃民衆疑慮政府施政方針所致。</p>
<p>每日新聞：一國在戰時，日用品如吿缺乏，首須設法消弭民間疑懼。</p>
<p>讀賣新聞：邇來政府作爲，恒秘而不宣，民衆乃相率以自願生計爲事。政府欲求全國合作，必不可得。</p>
<p>日日新聞：民氣不振，原因甚多，政府無誠意，其一也</p>
<p>每日新聞：民衆精神煥散，原因旣多，補救辦法，乃趨複雜。</p>
<p>此種評論，發於一年半前，殆將目爲大逆不道，今則幾無日不見矣。一般人雖承認樹立「東亞新秩序」計劉，必須進行，但於保護如本國內經濟一層，則亦日見關切。某作者且在大阪每日新聞發表露骨文字曰，一國無論如何聚精會神作戰，要亦有其限度。。苟置此限度於不顧，必將危及國民經濟生活。</p>
<p>此外，報紙諷示軍部政策不復完全適宜者，亦時有所聞。惟因憲兵監視甚嚴，乃無人敢公然譴責陸軍耳。（　譯Christian　ScienceMonitor）</p>
<h3>華北的貧窮</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>「華北大部份中國居民即將陷入赤貧的境况。中國人應付生存危險的天然抵抗力和復興力，常爲世人所稱道。他們優於克復一切天災人禍，能使經濟生活迅速恢復原狀。然而目今的華北，尤其是廣大的鄕區，居民的生存，却根本上動搖了。」</p>
<p>這是天津總商會年報中的一節，足見人們對目下華北經濟狀况的焦慮。內地水災區域的飢饉狀况，似乎毫無救濟辦法。直接振濟，無法進行。日人堅執統制食糧分配，使內地在實際上陷於封鎖，救濟團體因之無法將食糧運往災區。惟北平天津等大城市的情况，近來已稍見好轉。</p>
<p>河北省平時所產五穀，年的七白萬噸。天津輸入的各種食糧雖不算少，但不出二十四萬噸，不到土產的二十分之一。由此可知災區的慘狀了。災民如何苟延殘喘，無人知道。過去二十年來，災禍迭起，到這次水災而達極點。始則大旱和飢饉，內戰朋興，接着是中日戰爭，不斷的游擊戰事，和日軍的進擾，繼而洪水爲災。世上任何一地，大的沒有像河北省十年來所受痛苦的悽慘。</p>
<p>華北的經濟地位很像張作霖時代的東三省。當然，華北的「特殊地位」純粹是人爲的，在經濟方面尤缺少特殊地位的地理歷史和天然的條件。這種特殊地位完全是爲一種政治目的造成。可是華北在經濟上的嚴重缺陷，苟不加以補救，其影響也許會使這種政治目的，無法達釗。華北原不能在自己範圍中爲一個經濟單位而活動，然而目下正在企圖進行的，恰是這種自作單位的活動。</p>
<p>在從前軍閥時代的分崩離析中，仍有許多牢不可破的連繫，保持着整個必要的經濟上團結，而减少分裂的害處。例如無論有何政治上和地方上的變動，經濟制度總維持其完整。這一點至今還是淪陷區內的游擊區中的重大因素。</p>
<p>組織經濟集團的談話不絕於耳。但華北的實况，却在背道而馳。遠東各地物價高漲，華北的物價却漲得出奇，這衹是極惡劣的經濟情况的徵象，再者，輸出的劇跌和輸入的空前大增，也是一種不良徵象。</p>
<p>十餘年前，外蒙被蘇聯割出華北的經濟範圍，其貿易便不再經過天津。現在內蒙父跟着樹立一種「獨立」經濟制度。在某方面，華北和內蒙已從互相抵補不足的狀况，變成敵對狀態，這在雙方死命爭取外匯一事，尤其顯明。</p>
<p>從前華北從東三省，華中華南和他國輸人食物和他種貨物，現在的「滿洲國」却以自身的利害尊重，往時對華北的貿易關係已吿隔絕，使這兩區間天然的經濟聯繫歸於斷絕。從經濟意識上說來，因爲華北流通特殊貨幣，華中華南幾已變成「外國」。其依然維持着的關係，祇是用法幣作媒介才能存在。華北平時的輸出多已改運其他口岸，最嚴重的乃是物品出產地和分銷地之間已吿隔絕，究竟總額多少，亦無從知道。外間的批評却以聯準銀行的紙幣發行爲對象，聯凖紙幣所流通的區域雖祇限於各人城市及交通綫，這在一萬萬居民的廣大區域中僅佔一小部份，可</p>
<p>日本，朝鮮，台灣，「滿洲國」，及日軍佔領區域內所流通的無數紙幣，差不多全是疊積在日本金凖備的薄弱基礎上的，而一般人對於中國內地所使用中央及共黨發行的紙幣是聯準幣發行額，似乎比一九三七年以前中國紙幣在華北全部的最高流通數量還增一倍。</p>
<p>聯準銀行第二屆年會報告說：在舊歷新年，紙幣發行總額共計五萬千萬元，幾較上年增加一倍，與上半年相較也增加二萬萬元之譜。雖說爲物價高漲之故，須力防通貨膨脹，並收回多餘的紙幣，但是從舊歷新年以後，祇收回一千萬元，而本年一二月間增加的數目却達五千萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>去年的貿易，計輸出較一九三八年减少百分之四十五，由一寓七千六百萬元降至九千五百五十萬元。輸出雖减少近半，而輸入反增加百分之四十左右。其價値約三四倍輸出。這種情形又與一九三八年一樣，即增加最多的，初是民食所需的穀類及麪粉。計天津一處，增加百分之三十。</p>
<p>這種輸入增加的現衆，原因雖然很多，但是由於聯準幣價値時常下跌，匯率降到從來未有的低水準，致引起某種資金逃避，却也是一個很充分的理由。國內生產力銳减亦爲一種原因。</p>
<p>本年最初的幾個月中，外貨輸入已有顯明的銳减，恐尙有繼續下跌的可能。</p>
<p>除此而外，目前華北已被迫匯出空前的鉅額金錢，向外國輸入民生必需的實糧。國內食料及農作物的出產已感不足，而所出產者，又常被交戰方面所徵用，或以遠低於市價的價格，强迫收買。農人們見勞力的結果，旣不能得到公道的代價，於是對於米，麥，棉，蔴的種植，除去自己所需要之外，不肯再努力墾植。牛羊騾馬等的飼養，亦因缺乏鼓勵爲不感興趣。棉花，羊毛，苧蔴，及牛羊皮革的輸出皆被禁止，幾已完全停止。</p>
<p>外匯跌落很巨，旣無貨物輸出，便無外幣可得。民衆貧困，無力向外國採購必要的食糧。本市幣値止在低落，生活程度却激增不巳。在經濟的均衡上已有　口開着，彌合已很困難了。</p>
<p>特殊地位爲政治上和戰略上工具，其價値視經濟實力而定。政治之手段祇是一個骨幹，而給予血肉和生活力的乃是經濟制度。經濟情形，旣然是這樣的貧乏，所謂特殊地位等於夢境。</p>

<h3>華北日軍已成強弩之末</h3>
<p>中國游擊隊已返冀中平原。日軍懂死富士康較大城市，處境危殆。其給養雖由得兵護送之汽車隊接濟，然斷續無定時，且行駛為難。鄕間則華軍自由往來，晉省日軍仍藉口困守中部狹長平原暨鐵路綫而已，本年初，日軍在晉少消耗大量人力物力進行「掃蕩」戰，寸土未獲。日來開封南之東平，豫北彰德，及平漢路西北山麓一帶，皆有激戰，日軍終無所得。日方動用軍隊，顯感　不敷，其質亦較最初侵略之日軍為劣。日陸軍頑固派仍謂須用「閃電戰」以求速決，然日軍作戰三載，資源頻竭，何能發動「閃電戰」。若僅利用目前實力，重行進攻，充其量不過如夏季雷電，倐忽一閃而已。單以華北而言，日方至少須增精兵五十萬，附以機械化配備及飛機，始能一逞（節譯字林西報北平通信）</p>

<h3>補述「升學指導」</h3>
<p>— 方</p>
<p>讀完了仲毅君的「升學指導二文後，覺得還有幾點是仲毅君所尚未談到的；現在就讓筆者補述於下：</p>
<p>第一，關於升學的凖備工夫，在筆者認爲如果是作文，常識，算術三科，大致已有相當把握。對於　文一課，亦應當預先有一番準備，最普通的是一些簡單的生字及淺近的文法，都要能够澈底了解；因爲現在上海的一般中學，在人學考試中大概已都有了英文這一課吧，而且所佔的地位亦不會在算術等之下的。</p>
<p>第二，現在的中學，大概可分三類：即普通中學，職業中學，及師範學校。如果你將來預備在敎育界上做事的。那麼，現在你就該升入師範學校爲是；職業中學又可以分爲工科，商科，理科等　，都是預備你畢業後入社會應用的，普通中學則是預備你再升學的。所以在你選擇學校的時候，固然要選好學校，才是你的目標；但是，另一面要符合你將來的志願，這一點亦是升學的小朋友不可不顧到的。不然，學非所用，將來的前途，恐怕很危險吧。</p>
<p>第三，在升學考試時，事前需要把各項應考的步驟辦理消楚。當你擇定了要考的學校後，先去討一份該校的章程來，再依了章程上所載的手續去報名，考試。關於這些事情，小朋友們自己亦很明瞭，但是有時不免疏忽，以致會錯過報名日期等；所以筆者冉來提及一遍。</p>
<p>升學的各位小朋友，能够升學斷非是一件可以引以爲榮的事情。你們應該怎樣利用自己優越的環境刻意求進呢！「學到老，　不了」，求取學問，正是沒有止境的！</p>
<h3>種蘋果樹的李勳</h3>
<p>— 王貽珏</p>
<p>小朋友們，下面是一個很有意思的故事，這故事中的主人李勳，他能够犧牲了個人的前途，去苦幹沒有人注意，沒有錢酬報，而事實上對於人類極有益的事情。他是成功了，他救了同胞，救了地方</p>
<p>在某一個大學的校園裏，學生李動和幾個同學，爲了畢業後的出路，談論着各入的志願。有的想做軍事家，有的想做政治家，獨有李勳却想釗西北去種頻果樹，因爲西北地方常常發生天災，他知道如果有大量的樹木生長出來了天災便會减少的。當他述說志願時，使同學們失聲而笑，都以爲幹這事太不値得了。可赴李動雖受了同學的嘲笑，意志仍很堅汰，準備於畢業後出發。</p>

<h3>板凳和沙發</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>時鐘打了四下，庸兒拿了書包，拖着疲乏的身子，打從學校裏回到家裏去。一踏進家中的門口，即忙放掉書包，去倒了杯白開水，便把整個兒的身子放在沙發中，感覺到異常的舒適。他是一個年幼的孩子，上了這幾個鐘點的課，竟會這樣的疲乏不堪嗎？道也難怪他，在早上七點鐘多便走到學校裏，中午趕回家來，吃一頓飯；下午一時半，父要上課了，直到四點鐘才放學。他的學校是從內地逃難來的，因此校中的設備是很簡陋，就是他們課室裏的桌凳也是簡單得小能冉簡單了—一條狹長的板凳，一張小課桌，竟要坐上四五個同學，因此他們每一個人在板凳上，僅能容納半爿屁股的地位，所以上了道麽長長正一天的課，雖小致於疲乏不堪，却至少是很吃力的了。</p>
<p>這時他把一大部分的身子，服服貼貼地安置在沙發中，更喝上了一口開水，在他臉上便現出很安逸的樣兒，更閉上了眼，靜靜地休息着。可是沒有一刻鐘，開門聲擾亂了在安息着的庸兒，原來他哥哥也回來了。「哥哥，這沙發很舒服」。他笑嘻嘻地對宗兒說着。</p>
<p>「你可知道：爲什麼坐在沙發裏比較舒適」？宗見反問着他。庸兒顯出不高興多說的語調：「不和你多辯論。總之，這凶爲它是沙發的緣故。」你的意思因爲它是沙發，所以很舒服，這句話說得不妥，難道別的椅子，都小舒服的嗎？要知道：爲什麼坐沙發是舒服的緣故」？</p>
<p>「好，你講吧。」這問題稍引起了庸兒的注意。</p>
<p>「把板凳和沙發舉個例說明一下：我們坐在平硬而狹小的板凳上覺得很吃力，而坐在有彈簧墊子的大沙發上就覺非常舒服，這因爲我們的身體和凳上相接觸的面積是很狹小，我們身體的重量就集中在這小面積上，便覺吃力。而沙發是凹形而寬大，所以接觸身體的地位大得多，更可分散開身體的　量，也就把體重分散在大面積上，就很舒適。」「那麼凡是硬的東西坐上去，總是不舒服的。」庸兒接口道。「這話不是道樣　的，凡是把身體的壓力均衡地分配，就很舒服，譬如當我們坐在沙發上，使我們不平直的身體和沙發相合，且都入深陷狀能，因此身體表面活力的分散，達到意想不到的均勻。但即使睡在最堅硬的床上，也會感到一點不吃力，那有個條件：就是能把壓力平均地分配在廣大的面積上。這隻堅硬而舒適的床的製法是很特殊：先臥在輕鬆的粘土上，於是把身體凹凸的痕跡印在粘土上，再用大石頭依照那痕跡的凹凸琢成一隻大床，再照先前的那樣躺下去，那和睡在「席夢思」床上是一樣的舒適，不過做這樣的大床，在世界上恐怕我不到一個這樣蠢笨的愚人吧。」</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（七）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>正在道時，那導　和其他兩三個人走進來了。霎時之間，大家都寂靜無聲。我們的敎師便開始對大家說道：「這一位就是敎育影片公司的導演却爾斯雷蒙先生。我想他一定有幾句話要對列位太太們說的。」於是雷蒙先生就放開脚步，走了上來，他是一位模樣兒很淸秀的男子，嘴上留着一抹棕色的小子，年紀和我爸爸不相上下。他開口說，他料知大家早已知道他到這裏來的原因，不用多說，如今要請列位太太走開這麽一二十分鐘，他要和孩子們單獨的談談。媽媽伸手把我的鬈髮繞在伊的指　上捲了幾下，然後低低地對我說道：「親愛的，他要是喚你眺舞，或喚你歌唱，你儘可像平時一樣，大大方方的跳與唱好了。」</p>
<p>人們往往問我第一次遇見導演時，是怎樣的表演給他看的。我可曾覺得神經緊張嗎？我可曾嚇得哭出來麽？我可曾跟着媽媽一塊兒逃跑嗎？他們又好奇的問我，當時是不是走到雷蒙先牛跟前，微笑着對他說：「我是秀蘭鄧波兒就讓我跳舞給你瞧吧！」有的人這樣說：「你一定有什麼特別的舉動，引起他的注意，所以才把你從許多孩子中挑選出來的。」</p>
<p>但我切實地吿知他們，那時自己並沒有什麼特別的舉動，不過在雷蒙先生跟前走過罷了。就是別的孩子也是如此，逐一的走過雷蒙先生，讀他過目，我自己也不知道怎麼會給他挑選出來的；直到三四天後，雷蒙先生打電話給媽媽喚伊帶我到攝影塲去試一試鏡頭。</p>
<p>曾有好多人對我說：「我料知雷蒙光生一定是你所欲喜的導演了。秀蘭說出老實話來！」我聽了這樣的話，很覺生氣，冷冷地答道：「我不知那一個才是我所歡喜的導演！」可甘，這也是一句老實話；凡是給我主演的影片做　演的都是我所歡喜的導演。譬如雷蒙先生做我的導演時那麽他就是我所歡喜的導演。還有一位哈密爾頓馬法登先生—我常常稱他哈馬法登因爲人家都是這樣　呼他的。他給華納裴克斯德，梅琪伊文絲，的翰鮑爾士，傑密鄧恩，史旦平佛吉和我　行人，導演「起立歡呼」道部影片，於是他也就是我所歡喜的導演了。總之，我主演的影片很多，那麽我所歡喜的導演也多起來了。</p>
<p>又有一般人問我，第一次在攝影塲上試鐘頭時，可有什麼特殊的感覺？我幾乎老是這樣回答他們：「我一些兒也不覺得什麼。」有時我又換一句回答道：「我只覺得一切都很好。」</p>

<h3>從方言說到歌唱</h3>
<p>詩曰：「八音克諧，無相奪倫，」八音的註釋是：一金，石。絲竹，匏，土，革，木，古人又說：「絲不如竹，竹不如肉，」可見得歌唱的聲音，是高出一切了。歌聲的所以能高出一切，因爲組織上比較任何樂器更繁複些，譬如說琵琶，可以說指聲錚錚，說簫笛，可以說其聲嗚嗚，惟有歌唱，却不能形容得那麼簡單，紙有形容小孩纔能說吚呀學語。</p>
<p>我放喜歡聽鄉下小姑娘唱山歌，但必須要吐字淸晰，發音輕妙，纔能動聽，歌唱所以比樂器更動聽的原故，大半就在吐字發音上面，因爲有了詞句，就更容易使人了解當局者悲歡離合的情緒，吐字淸晰，就是要使人容易聽得出詞句的原故。</p>
<p>那未吐字要怎樣纔能達到淸晰的目標呢？在中國，要求普遍化，實在不很容易。北平人設話，蘇州人說他是野聲野氣，無錫人說話，鎭江人聽不懂，你想這問題複雜小複雜？所以無論何種歌曲，必須要求一種普遍適合於各處方言的字眼，蘇灘裏面唱「花」字，並不像蘇州人說話一樣的用嘬口音，却像北平說話一樣的用張口音，這就是力求普遍化的明徵。彈詞家唱起「大人」二字來，不讀如穌州音的「渡銀」，平劇裏面小生讀「人」字多用上口音，程繼仙念人」字，夏荷生念「人」字的聲音差不多，現在流行的新歌曲，都用的國音，然而國語並不一定是京話，照理我們聽起來應該覺得格外淸晰，不過事實却不一定如此，這是歌者缺乏訓練的緣故，彷彿平劇裏面有許多坤旦，把「卿家」念成「親家」，也當然不能說是平劇的根本錯誤，總而言之，現在的一切歌曲，都可着普遍化的路上在前進，讀字當然也不能例外。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第一章　「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>霍桑拿起來的那枝烟嘴，本放在書桌左端的邊上，那烟嘴的口部露出在書桌邊緣的外面。原來那烟嘴口裏還裝着沒有燒完的烟尾。那放烟嘴的人，分明是防燒壞書桌，故而這樣讓烟嘴口露在外邊。</p>
<p>霍桑的目光注視着手中的烟嘴，一壁向我說道：「包朗，你估量一下，這烟嘴値多少錢？」</p>
<p>我湊近去瞧瞧。「兩三毛錢，至多也不出半元。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。「對。這是一隻廉價的烟嘴，可是用得很仔細。你瞧這東西的顏色，可見已被用過相當的時間，但烟嘴的本身並無擦傷痕跡，尾端也沒有牙齒的蝕痕，就是那管口上鑲着的銅圈，裏圈雖巳燒黑，外面却仍擦得很亮。」</p>
<p>我應迫：「是的，這烟嘴的主人似乎很重視這東西。倪金壽也接嘴說：「這東西定不是這位舞后的。」霍桑道：那自然。因此，我覺得似乎有注意的必要。」倪金壽問道：這烟嘴可能給你什麽綫索？」霍桑微笑着應道：那還談不到。不過可以窺見一斑烟嘴主人的個性。這個人很謹愼，而且用錢很省儉。你瞧，這殘餘的烟尾已燒進了銅圈的範圍以內。」他把烟嘴湊到鼻孔上嗅了一嗅。「這紙烟也一定是廉價品。」倪金壽問道：「這上面會有指印嗎？」</p>
<p>「也許有的，但不見得有什麼用。我們得先問一問這烟嘴究竟是誰的。這屋子裏也許有人會知道。」他說時重新將烟嘴放在書桌邊的原處，那塊白巾仍拿回來放在他的袋中。倪金壽道：「我去叫那李芝範下樓來罷。」霍桑道：好，－唉，且慢。這書桌抽屜上留着鑰匙呢。你瞧見了沒有！」（十六）</p>

<h3>New Defense Line Set Up in the Loire River Basin; Allied Forces Prepare for Major Counteroffensive; Large Numbers of British Reinforcements Cross the Strait; Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Maginot Line</h3>
<p>London, according to reliable sources last night, France will continue to resist German aggression, and the Allied forces will launch a major counteroffensive to repel the Teutonic troops who occupied Paris yesterday. The French government has moved to Bordeaux, and a fragment report from French radio was received here, stating that French Prime Minister Reynaud and French military officers are encouraging the people to continue fighting for national honor. A spokesman for the British War Office here stated that if German troops are stationed in Paris, the Allied forces will not recognize Paris as an undefended city. The spokesman continued, stating that the future policy of France is a matter of military secrecy and cannot be predicted at this time, but the French authorities will definitely adopt a plan. Now, hundreds of thousands of British troops, along with huge numbers of airplanes, tanks, and artillery, have crossed the English Channel. Military observers say that the Allied forces may strengthen the new defense line south of Paris and use a portion of the army, several divisions, to resist the German attempt to attack the northwestern section of the Maginot Line. Although the French defense forces are currently exhausted, if British reinforcements arrive at the front in time, there is still hope of annihilating the German onslaught. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>New York, according to reports received here, German troops are advancing rapidly on both the east and west sides of Paris, and have reached at least twenty miles south of Paris. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Tours, according to a message from the German Supreme Command last night, German troops advancing from fifty miles east of Paris threatened a certain divergence point of the new French defense line yesterday. The German troops in the east are advancing rapidly in two directions, one towards Romilly, which is forty-eight miles from Châlons-sur-Marne, and is the intersection of the Seine and Aube rivers, fifty-five miles southeast of Paris, and the other southeast along the Seine River to Saint-Thierry. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in France, according to military sources, after the French army withdrew from Paris to the Loire River basin, its rearguard, covered by the air forces of Britain and France, is hindering the enemy's pursuit. The enemy's motorized units, covered by tanks, are advancing in an arrow formation and have repeatedly been blocked by French tank defenses. Therefore, they have to wait for medium tanks to cover infantry units and launch a more organized attack. Our air force is fiercely bombing the German infantry and tank concentration points between Marne and Moulin. In addition, the enemy troops in the area of Châlons-sur-Marne are advancing along the Vesle River towards Châlons, presumably intending to threaten the western Maginot Line from the rear. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in France, the General Headquarters has just released a battle report stating: (1) The fighting in Normandy is currently taking place west of Rouen and Évreux; (2) Our troops south of Paris have completed their retreat in good order; (3) In the Champagne region, enemy troops are intensifying their advance towards Troyes and Saint-Thierry, and are being intercepted by our troops, with fierce fighting on both sides; (4) In the Lorraine and Alsace provinces, enemy artillery is fiercely bombarding our entire line and various communication lines. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Side of the Maginot Line: German Offensive is Fierce</p>
<p>Somewhere in France, last night, the German army used a large number of mechanized units to attack the Maginot Line fiercely, a situation only seen since the beginning of the war. However, the Maginot Line remains unmoved. According to military observers, the German army is using tanks, mechanized units, and airplanes to jointly attack the mountainous area west of the Saar region. Although they have paid a great price to capture several outposts, they have not broken into the defense system. French casualties are extremely low. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in France, the French army has been fighting hard for days without rest, and has reached the point of exhaustion, coupled with a lack of fresh troops and armaments, it had to retreat today, but still fought while retreating against the German army threatening the entire side of the Maginot Line. When the German army entered the lifeless Paris, the French government had already moved from the city of Tours to a safe location in the southwest to avoid being surrounded by the German army. As for the war situation, it can be described as follows: (1) On the extreme west line, the enemy's mechanized units, with the assistance of large infantry units, are surging like a tide, directly attacking our positions; (2) On the extreme east line, that is, the side of the Maginot Line, the enemy's offensive is extremely fierce, but as of today, our army is still able to defend the city of Montmédy, which is also the key point of the Maginot Line, and is blocking the enemy's advance in the Argonne area and the eastern part of the Champagne area; (3) In other parts of the Champagne area, the enemy troops are advancing towards the towns of Romilly and Saint-Thierry. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London, the French side issued a communiqué last night stating that the war continues on the entire line from the coast to Argonne, but the situation has eased in some locations. Our army, especially the Paris garrison, withdrew according to plan, but our army has counterattacked several times. This morning, the enemy, assisted by tanks and airplanes, launched an attack on our positions west of the Saar, with a very strong momentum. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris Presents a Desolate Scene; Citizens Retreat Southward in Endless Streams</p>
<p>Somewhere in France, officials have just announced that the enemy army entered Paris last night. At that time, the city was desolate, with only the police maintaining order. Our army's troops defending Paris, who were originally fighting on the east and west sides, have now made contact on the south side. The communication lines between Paris and other places have been cut off. The famous bridges on the Seine River have not been damaged. Our refugees are now retreating southward in endless streams in various vehicles, and a large number of machines and workers are also being moved to newly developed industrial areas to continue to contribute to the war effort. In addition, the General Headquarters issued a battle report this morning stating that the Paris defense forces have retreated in accordance with the orders of the authorities and are now continuing to fight with superhuman courage and in excellent order. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London, according to a Reuters reporter who left Paris a few hours before the German army arrived, reporting from somewhere in France on the final situation in Paris before the German army was about to enter the city, saying that there were a few soldiers and some civilians wandering around the city, apparently aimlessly, but the order in the city was quite good. In the suburban areas, women were still seen going to the market to purchase goods as usual. The authorities currently stationed in the city are the Archbishop of Sauerde, personnel from major service agencies, mobile guards, and fire brigades. No artillery fire or bomb explosions were heard in the city, but those who wanted to drive out of Paris, even with official permits, were blocked by the few soldiers on duty in the streets, and passage was extremely difficult. All railway stations have been closed for two days because all vehicles are used for military transport. The roads outside the city are filled with refugees. The Reuters reporter personally saw a truck full of wounded people in a central market attempting to drive out of the city three times, but to no avail. Finally, the wounded were ordered to leave the city as quickly as possible on foot. Due to a lack of bandages, the wounds of many of them were not bandaged. At present, only a very small number of medical teams are still providing services. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters, the German war report this afternoon stated that between the Seine and Meuse rivers, the German army is pursuing the French army, making rapid progress. Many enemy troops have surrendered without a fight. The new French troops who have fought in recent days are mostly organized from defeated troops and reserves. Since June 5, more than 200,000 enemies have been captured, and countless military supplies have been seized. Yesterday, the German army occupied Paris without resistance, and the German flag is flying over the Palace of Versailles. The enemy army south of Argonne was forced to retreat to the southeast. Yesterday, the German air force attacked the Maginot Line along the Saar border. Various defense works, artillery, and infantry positions, as well as troops traveling along the way, were bombed and strafed, suffering heavy losses. Several German infantry units, under the cover of heavy artillery, penetrated deep into the Maginot front and captured many sections of the position. The fortress of Saarbrücken, one of the strongest defense works, has been occupied by the German army. Many French railways and trains have been destroyed by German aircraft, and several airfields have also been attacked by German aircraft. In total, 43 enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday, including 13 shot down in aerial combat, 9 shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest destroyed on the ground. Five German aircraft are missing. On June 13, the number of enemy aircraft lost was more than ten, with the total number reported by various reports actually reaching 39. The number of German aircraft lost was also more than four, actually six, because the reports could not be compiled immediately that night. (Haitong dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to a statement issued by German military experts, supplementing the German High Command's war report, it is briefly stated that Germany occupied Paris yesterday, which is the fourth time in history that German troops have entered Paris. The French High Command, feeling the threat of the German army, had no choice but to abandon the capital, and the German army entered Paris without a fight. The land north of the Seine River, including the port of Le Havre, has fallen into German hands. The German army has crossed the Seine River in several places between Paris and the English Channel, and has broken through the Marne River line, occupying the railway and highway hub of Francaus. When the French army abandoned important military strategic points, they lost a lot of equipment, which will be difficult to replenish later. The occupation of Paris has plunged the French army on all lines into a desperate situation. Montmédy, an important point in the northwest end of the Maginot Line, has been occupied by the German army. The German army on the Saar front is also making progress in attacking the front of the Maginot Line. The Argonne Forest is entirely under German control, and the French positions east of the forest have been shaken. The German army has approached Verdun, which was a famous battlefield in the last World War. The German army will continue to pursue and annihilate all enemy troops before stopping. German aircraft are actively operating, destroying several French fortresses, and bombing rear communication lines and coastal areas, sinking two transport ships. The German anti-aircraft artillery north of the port of Le Havre also sank six transport ships. German submarines have also continued to operate, sinking an auxiliary cruiser (17,000 tons) and a merchant ship (12,000 tons). (Haitong dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin, military circles here said last night that Germany is now launching a new offensive against the Allied forces on the entire French front, hoping to completely eliminate or subdue all French troops on the European continent within two weeks and end the third phase of the war. The fourth phase will then be an attack on Britain, which is expected to be unprecedentedly fierce. German military circles claim that Germany has not yet fully unleashed its full power in this war, so the amazing developments in the future are really expected. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Rumor that France Intends to Negotiate a Separate Peace with Germany; British Official Statement Denies Rumor</h3>
<p>London, according to responsible authorities in London this afternoon, rumors that France is now about to succumb to Germany or negotiate a separate peace with Germany are completely groundless. This statement was likely spread by the German side. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome, the Spanish army's occupation of Tangier (North Africa, opposite Gibraltar) and the German army's occupation of Paris caused a widespread rumor here yesterday that France wanted to negotiate a separate peace with the Rome-Berlin Axis. At the same time, the Geneva correspondent of the fascist newspaper "La Stampa" claimed that French Prime Minister Reynaud and French President Lebrun disagreed, because the French president wanted to negotiate a separate peace with Germany and Italy.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Paris</h3>
<p>As a result of the rapid development of the recent European war, the German army finally invaded Paris. This can be said to be the end of the second stage of the current European war. This European war began in September of last year, but in the first seven months, except for the rapid resolution of the Polish war, the Western Front was very quiet. This was the first stage of the war. It was not until April 9 of this year that the German army suddenly launched a blitz attack to the northwest, invading Denmark and Norway. On May 10, it invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, forcibly passing through to attack northern France. This was the second stage of the war, with the invasion of Paris as its finale. In the German westward conquest, Denmark surrendered without a fight, the King of Belgium surrendered halfway, and the Netherlands and Norway both ceased resistance after the royal family fled, adding very little resistance to Germany. The fall of Paris this time is, of course, different. The French army's retreat is a planned shift of positions, and the French government authorities have also reiterated their determination to resist to the end. Therefore, the fall of Paris can certainly be said to be the end of the second stage of the European war, and immediately following it is the beginning of the third stage of the European war.</p>
<p>The fall of Paris naturally has certain benefits for Germany. First, in terms of increasing fighting spirit, this cannot but be said to be a major gain. Second, in terms of diplomatic relations, the recent smooth progress of the German army's operations in the Paris area is the most important factor in promoting Italy's entry into the European war. Mussolini was deeply afraid that if Germany defeated Britain and France alone, it would lower Italy's status, so on the eve of the fall of Paris, he resolutely declared war on Britain and France, trying to share Germany's credit. The contradictions existing between Germany and Italy certainly cannot be eliminated simply because Italy joined the war to help Germany, but Italy's participation in the war is, after all, beneficial to Germany. Third, economically, the Paris Basin is the most important agricultural area in France, producing abundant food. France's most important coalfields are also located in the north, in the cities of Nort and Calais on the French border and the English Channel. The annual coal production of 33 million tons accounts for 65% of the national total. As for industry, Lille and Roubaix are the center of the French textile industry, and Le Havre and Calais are important ports on the west coast of France. Now that all of the above areas have been occupied by the German army, the blow to France is quite severe. Fourth, militarily, the fall of Paris means that Germany has completed the encirclement of southeastern England, and from now on, the German air force and submarines can use northwestern France as a base to attack Britain. For France, the rear of the Maginot Line will be in danger of being invaded by the German army. At present, the German armored divisions in the city of Reims (northeast of Paris) are attacking south with all their strength, and their purpose is to cut off the connection between the Maginot Line and the main force of the French army in central France.</p>
<p>At present, the situation of the Allied countries, especially France, is indeed extremely difficult, but it is not hopeless. The world may doubt whether the French army can continue to fight in the future because of the fall of Paris. In fact, the French army's local defeat is a fact, but resolutely abandoning Paris without a fight cannot but be said to be strategically justified. The terrain near Paris is a large basin, sloping downward from the Belgian border directly to Paris, making it easy to attack from above and difficult to defend. Further south beyond Paris, it rises again step by step, making it easy to defend and difficult to attack. Modern warfare takes eliminating the enemy's main force as the decisive victory, that is, preserving the main force and being able to continue fighting, so even if defeated, it is not truly defeated. Therefore, General Weygand, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces, abandoning Paris and changing to defend south of Paris can be explained as avoiding harm and seeking benefit. The French army's retreat is neither the elimination of the main force nor a collapse, and should be estimated as a strategic shift. The northeast, northwest, and due north of Paris are relatively indefensible, but the southwest of Paris has the Normandy Mountains and the Breton Mountains, and the southeast of Paris has the Vosges and Jura Mountains. Due south of Paris is the so-called Central Highlands; all of these are dangerous locations. At present, the Vosges and Normandy Mountains form the east and west wings of the French army, which can be defended in retreat and used as a base for counterattack in advance. Therefore, as time goes on, the French army's situation may gradually improve from stability. The above is a discussion specifically on the French-German war. In addition: (1) With Italy's participation in the war, the main battlefield will be in the Mediterranean. The British and French Mediterranean fleets are quite powerful, and the countries of the Near East are also closer to Britain and France, so the British and French advantages over Italy have not been shaken. As for the French-Italian border, it is the Alps, with layers of peaks and ridges, making it difficult to launch large-scale operations, which does not pose a major threat to the safety of the French rear. (2) Control of the seas is still absolutely in the hands of Britain and France. In other words, Britain and France can freely obtain all overseas human and material supplements. This convenience is not available to Germany and Italy. (3) More importantly, American aid to Britain and France is becoming more and more active. On the day Italy declared war on Britain and France, US President Roosevelt publicly declared that he would step up material and resource assistance to countries that resist violence, and later reiterated this promise in his reply to the French Prime Minister's request for assistance. American-made aircraft and munitions are being shipped east in large quantities. - The above three points are all important factors that are beneficial to Britain and France.</p>
<p>In the past seventy years, this is the second time that Paris has been invaded by the German army. In 1871, the internal political chaos and diplomatic isolation of France were far greater than today, but in the end, it was able to overcome various difficulties and revive from blood and tears. Today's France is certainly in a difficult situation, but internally, everyone is united, and externally, there is Britain fighting shoulder to shoulder and the sympathy and assistance of the United States. As long as it does not lose heart or slacken, and continues to struggle, the French nation should still have a great and bright future.</p>

<h3>In the Atlantic Fleet, the United States Increases its Destroyer Fleet, Continues to Closely Monitor the Situation in the Pacific, and President Roosevelt Signs the Army Appropriations Bill</h3>
<p>Washington - The U.S. Navy has recently established a new destroyer fleet and added it to the Atlantic Fleet, with Admiral Leims serving as the commander of the 100 U.S. warships currently stationed in the Atlantic. Admiral Leims' flagship will be the "Russell." The U.S. Navy has already announced that 35 destroyers and 36 submarines currently stationed in San Diego, Philadelphia, and Mare Island will be put into service. In addition, 100 warships have already been ordered to serve. The newly formed Atlantic Fleet will include the battleships "New York," "Arkansas," "Texas," and "Wyoming," as well as five cruisers and one aircraft carrier.

<p>Washington - Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, who recently told the Washington National Food Council that a U.S.-Japan war was inevitable, reiterated in a speech yesterday in Charlottesville, Virginia, the U.S. Navy's demand for the establishment of naval bases in Guam (1,200 nautical miles south of Yokohama) and the Philippines, strongly arguing that if the United States joins Europe, the defense of the U.S. West Coast will be extremely important. This issue is of paramount importance. Unless the United States enters into defense agreements with other countries with interests in the Far East, it may be difficult to implement. He also stated that the Philippines, which currently serves as a buffer, requires the United States to develop a strong policy to deal with the island's future. If this policy is not well implemented, the chances of the United States being drawn into war in the future will be greater. (United Press report, 15th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Allocates 50,000 Yuan to Relieve Bombing Victims in Chongqing, and 20,000 Yuan to慰劳 Air Force Soldiers. Foreign Minister Wang Expresses Thoughts on Hull's Remarks</h3>
<p>Chongqing - It has been raining here for the past two days, which has spared the city from further bombing by Japanese planes.

This inhumane method of warfare only strengthens our determination to resist to the end. Secretary of State Hull's declaration should have made the Japanese warlords realize that their barbaric actions have no room for defense before civilized nations, and the world's righteous indignation will never cease due to the Japanese side's sophistry.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Requests Foreign Residents in Chongqing to Withdraw as Soon as Possible, Formally Notifies Five Countries: Britain, France, Belgium, Soviet Union, and the United States, Allowing Return Only After Military Operations End</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Arita formally notified five countries: Britain, France, Belgium, the Soviet Union, and the United States, requesting that residents of third countries withdraw from Chongqing as soon as possible and allowing return only after Japan has completed its military operations against Chongqing.

<h3>Germany Will Take Advantage of Victory to Launch Peace Offensive, Britain and France Determined to Fight to the End for Freedom, Surrender at This Time Will Result in Enslavement</h3>
<p>London - Information Officer to Parliament, Neilson, said in a speech in Leicester last night that Hitler may launch his peace offensive in the next few days, promising the people of Britain and France that he has no desire to conquer their countries, but only wants them to completely disarm. Herr Hitler may declare to us that we can still retain our empire (except for the colonies he wants to occupy), but we must abandon our free democratic institutions and accept a government appointed by Berlin, and at the same time surrender our fleet to Germany and Italy. Once Herr Hitler obtains our fleet, he will sweep through London and gradually and thoroughly eliminate our freedom, and reduce the working people to the level of slaves. After praising the bravery of the French army in battle, Mr. Nelson said that there will come a time when the German armored divisions will collapse due to lack of gasoline and lubricant, and the German soldiers will also lose their fighting power due to fatigue. The French army is blocking them south of Paris, and has built deep trenches and high fortresses to await the arrival of British troops and their equipment. The time when the German forces are exhausted may be approaching. It is a crime for us to embrace defeatism at this time. Mr. Nelson said at the end that the decisive battle of this war will not be on land in Europe, but in the oceans, in the air, and in distant continents. At that time, the unlimited resources of Britain and the Americas can be mobilized to change the course of the war. (Reuters report, 15th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Extols Peace, Says He Has No Desire to Invade the American Continent</h3>
<p>Berlin - Führer Hitler gave an interview to renowned American reporter Wiegand of the International News Service yesterday in "a certain place" in France, declaring, "The Americas for the Americans, and Europe for the Europeans. If this mutually beneficial Monroe Doctrine is adhered to by both sides, it will not only permanently preserve the peace of the New and Old Worlds, but also be the most ideal foundation for the peace of the entire world." Hitler then refuted with indignation the rumors about Hitler interfering in the Western Hemisphere in some way, saying that it was not only absurd but also childishly ridiculous for the Americas to fear an attack by Hitler or Germany. It was even more worrying and incomprehensible to say that the United States would be invaded by sea, air, or the "Fifth Column." Hitler then denied that he had any intention of "destroying the British Empire," but he was determined to destroy "the criminals who destroyed the British Empire." Wiegand then described his visit, saying that he was first taken by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's private plane to an airfield in a certain place in France, then changed to a car to a certain division headquarters, met with the German Foreign Minister and talked with him at length, then drove to a small castle to meet with Führer Hitler. Hitler was radiant and rosy-cheeked. He smiled slightly when talking to the reporter, and answered the reporter's questions in writing for an hour. Hitler first said that Germany has never interfered in American affairs, because it has never had any political or territorial interests in the American continent, not only in North America, but also in South America. Hitler stated, "I believe that your country's (referring to the United States) former President Monroe's policy is not only to unilaterally prevent European countries from interfering in the Americas, but also to prevent the Americas from being involved in European affairs. Therefore, I believe that 'the Americas for the Americans and Europe for the Europeans.'" The reporter asked for his views on President Roosevelt's military expansion plan. Hitler replied, "In answering this question, I do not want to criticize the American military expansion plan out of respect for the Monroe Doctrine, because the American military is irrelevant to me. What must be stated is that I am engaged in large-scale military expansion because I have no choice."</p>
<p>The reporter also asked for his views on the United States selling arms to Britain and France. Hitler replied, "The United States selling a large number of aircraft and arms to Britain and France cannot change the outcome of the war. The facts are there, and there is no need to elaborate."</p>
<p>The reporter then mentioned the question of the "Fifth Column." Hitler replied that the so-called Fifth Column simply does not exist. Hitler repeatedly stated that "Germany has won victory because its military organization is sound and its leaders are outstanding."</p>
<p>The reporter then asked if Germany was prepared to destroy the British Empire. Hitler replied that he had no such intention. "I have repeatedly made proposals, demanding that Germany be treated equally and demanding the return of Germany's colonies. Although London has repeatedly declared that it wants to eliminate Germany and divide Germany, I have never made the same remarks to Britain. After the battles in France, British politicians, with worried faces, asked the United States for assistance, saying that Germany wanted to destroy the British Empire. In fact, what the current war will destroy is only the capitalist groups that sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives to achieve private gains. This war will destroy Britain's control of the oceans and increase the happiness of all countries. Our ideal of freedom of the oceans is freedom of movement in the oceans between non-belligerent countries, without being controlled by any country."</p>
<p>Hitler then said that Germany has no territorial or political interests in the Mediterranean region. Britain and France demand to dominate the world, and various countries have gradually recognized their own rights and refused this demand.</p>
<p>Germany's peace goal is to restore peace. Germany did not declare war on Britain and France, but Britain and France declared war on Germany with ridiculous excuses. The basis of future peace is to recognize the true conditions of peace. In discussing issues vital to the survival of the great powers, peace cannot be guaranteed by treaties, but should be guaranteed by adjusting the relations between countries. If the Allied powers accelerate the victory of reason due to military defeat, then the heavy sacrifices of this war will not be in vain. (Haitong report, 15th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Promises Cannot Be Lightly Believed, Roosevelt Expresses Thoughts, Says Past Events Can Be Reviewed</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday listed the past facts of breaking promises and did not lightly believe the news that Hitler had said that he had no desires for the Western Hemisphere. President Roosevelt's statement was a criticism of a certain American reporter's Thursday interview with Führer Hitler. He said that he could enumerate the dates on which Germany had made promises to which countries and on which dates those promises were torn up, and further develop his comments. (United Press report, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - When German Führer Hitler met with reporters a few days ago, he said that the rumor that his country would invade the Americas was "absurd." Reporters asked President Roosevelt for his opinion on this matter today. The President immediately replied that his only thought on this matter was "to recall the past." Moreover, the so-called recollection can be traced back to several years ago and is very broad in time and space. The President also allowed reporters to publish this conversation in its original form. (Havas report, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Tenacity of French Women, British Queen Gives Radio Address, Expresses Sympathy and Admiration</h3>
<p>London - British Queen Elizabeth gave a radio address last night entitled "The Brave and Glorious Women of France," expressing sympathy and admiration for their suffering and bravery, and praising the valor of the French army, saying that its achievements are unparalleled in history. The Queen said that she is now thinking of her sisters in France, and she does not know how her heart will hang when the great battle in which her men are participating is taking place. She loves France very much, so she shares the pain of all her sisters. The posture of French women in the war is as noble as that of men. They tenaciously endure aggression, bombing, loss of possessions, and the destruction of families without complaint. We know that they are "happy to give all they have, even sacrifice their lives, to protect the safety of their country. A country with such men to defend it and such women to love it will sooner or later win victory. This kind of country has the right to receive the unlimited assistance of all free nations." She sincerely believes that after the bad times have passed, it will definitely turn from adversity to prosperity. At that time, the people of both countries will make up for the shortcomings in armaments with their perseverance and hard work. She wishes to express this hope to the bravery of the wounded French soldiers. Tonight, she wishes to express the deepest sympathy of all the women of Britain to her sisters in France. British women are prepared to make sacrifices with their allied sisters to seek the common victory of the two countries. (Reuters report, 15th)</p>

<h3>Turkish Parliament Discusses Steps to Take, While Simultaneously Noting the Attitudes of Neighboring Countries, The People's Party Supports Government Policy</h3>
<p>Istanbul - Following a meeting of the Republican People's Party in Ankara yesterday, the Turkish Parliament convened a plenary session in the afternoon to discuss the precise attitude Turkey should take regarding Italy's entry into the war. Commentators are emphasizing that Turkey is now faithfully adhering to its obligations, but is simultaneously carefully considering all necessary factors. Therefore, it must not only review Italy's intentions, but also take into account the attitudes of neighboring countries, such as the Soviet Union, which shares a large part of its border with Turkey. It is said that although Turkey's sympathies undoubtedly lean towards the Allied side, in legal terms, Turkey remains a neutral country, as evidenced by its signing of a £4 million trade agreement with Germany yesterday. This agreement is the result of the efforts of German special envoy Papen over the past two months. In addition to the above actions, Turkey continues its preparations for defense without懈, and conscription offices in Ankara and Istanbul are now engaged in registering specialists in various fields, indicating great activity. (Reuter dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Greek Panic, Soviet Labor Newspaper Says, Invasion Is Now Possible</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Labor Newspaper comments that developments in the Mediterranean have caused panic among countries in the region. Greece has recognized the need to take precautionary steps. Authorities in Athens believe that the country's invasion is now possible. This panic on the part of the Greek government is well-founded. Greece has a population of less than six million, and its military and economic strength are not very great. However, all the Greek islands are quite important. This point has attracted the attention of the belligerent countries. At present, no country in Europe is in a more difficult position than Greece. If Greece is close to Italy, the Allied navies will inevitably threaten the Greek coast. On the other hand, if Greece cooperates with Britain, it will be attacked on land. According to the Rome Forum's correspondent in Athens, "Britain, France, and Turkey are all putting pressure on Greece. Even before Italy joined the war, Turkish troops were preparing to occupy the island of Astypalaia with the assistance of the British and French navies. This landing force has been concentrated along the Anatolian coast, and British and French warships are constantly patrolling near Astypalaia. We expect Italy will definitely not stand idly by, as this area is extremely important to Italy. In any case, if the Mediterranean war reaches its climax, Astypalaia and Corfu will become Italy's primary targets. (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italy Expresses Respect for Egyptian Neutrality</h3>
<p>Rome - The mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Gaeta, wrote yesterday, claiming that although Italy has severed diplomatic relations with Egypt, Italy will continue to respect Egyptian neutrality.

<h3>U.S. President Declares Efforts to Aid Britain and France, Canadian Prime Minister Sends Telegram to Reynaud, Willing to Provide Maximum Assistance</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, while hosting reporters, reiterated that the United States will provide all possible assistance to the Allied powers, saying he had not yet received Reynaud's second appeal. President Roosevelt also announced that the United States had established a National Defense Committee, and the Army Appropriations Bill had been signed, allocating approximately $1.5 billion for expansion. (Reuter dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull, while hosting reporters today, was asked by a reporter whether he had touched upon the issue of the United States participating in the European war during his conversation with the ambassador. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that, regarding this issue, there was nothing to report other than the facts generally known by people at home and abroad. The so-called facts are that the United States is selling armaments to Britain and France, and the conditions are also well known. As for the issue of Ambassador to France Bullitt remaining in Paris, the State Department has not received any information, and it is not known whether he is being "protected" by the Germans. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Following repeated appeals from French Premier Reynaud to the United States, all circles here are showing sympathy, making it possible to prompt the government to accelerate the supply of various military supplies to Britain and France. In addition to President Roosevelt's declaration to the press that the government is determined to do everything possible to provide assistance as soon as possible, the Army and Navy are continuing to return various old-style armaments to manufacturers for resale to Britain and France. At the same time, the National Defense Committee is stepping up the organization of the armaments industry to ensure that factories can manufacture armaments, aircraft, and engines on a large scale. As for the issue of the United States entering the war, responsible parties have not discussed it, and most believe that it is inconvenient to raise this issue on the eve of the election. In addition, some Americans originally feared that France was about to give up fighting, which weakened their determination to support Britain and France in spirit. However, since Premier Reynaud issued his appeal yesterday, declaring that he would persevere to the end, these people's courage has been revived, and they have decided to push the government with all their strength to accelerate aid to the Allied powers. Moreover, the American people all recognize that if the government can do everything possible to help Britain and France and immediately develop the armaments industry, it will also be more beneficial to the country's defense. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>New York - Several New York shipping merchants are currently in Washington discussing with government authorities the possibility of preparing American ships to carry supplies to the Allied powers.

You may be assured that the people of North America will clearly observe the current needs. He believes that all of America's material and economic forces will be immediately mobilized without delay, because the free people of the world are inspired by France's sacrifice and fervent spirit as never before.

<h3>Chinese-British Company Holds Annual Meeting, Rights Infringed by Japanese</h3>
<p>London - The Chinese-British Company held its annual meeting here yesterday. Chairman Sir Plender gave a speech stating that the Chinese-British Company's loans have almost completely stopped being repaid, and its rights have been obstructed by the Japanese in an unprecedented way, causing the Chinese-British Company's situation last year to be extremely bad. It has lodged the strongest protest with the Japanese side. Even with the support of the British government, it has not received a satisfactory response. The Pingxi Railway has been operated by the Japanese, and the loans are due to be repaid, but the Japanese continue to control the Jinghu and Huhang Railways without repaying the loans. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has suffered very serious damage. Regarding the planned Sichuan-Burma Railway, the French export credit department has undertaken the funding for the Kunxu section, but the British export credit loan for building the Kunming-Burma section has not been obtained, so the Chinese-British Company is currently unable to participate in it. However, it hopes to eventually cooperate with this admirable plan. (Reuter Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Today is the Anniversary of the National Father's Ordeal, The Educational Federation Issues a Letter to Various Schools, The Spirit of Resolute Perseverance is a Model for Later Learners, Emulating the Premier Should Immediately Unite in Resolute Struggle</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the National Father Sun Yat-sen's ordeal in Guangzhou eighteen years ago. The Municipal Education Federation has specifically instructed schools at all levels to use the details of the National Father's ordeal as supplementary material in Chinese and History courses to teach students and make them understand the perilous situation the National Father was in at that time, to emulate his resolute perseverance, which is a model for later learners. At the same time, it also issued a letter to schools, stating, "Today, eighteen years ago, was the day of the National Father Sun Yat-sen's ordeal in Guangzhou. When we recall Chen Jiongming's insidious and ruthless plot, Chen's subordinates Hong Zhaolin and Ye Ju acting as his accomplices, and the National Father's spirit of perseverance and struggle after the ordeal, our deep feelings of grief and remembrance cannot help but arise spontaneously. The National Father is the creator of the Republic of China and a virtuous teacher of the world revolution. Chen Jiongming at that time was a military man who was personally promoted by the National Father. Unexpectedly, Chen not only repaid kindness with malice, but also dared to collude with the Northern warlords. When the Northern Expeditionary Army was progressing smoothly, he sent his subordinates Hong Zhaolin and Ye Ju to lead armed traitors in an attempt to harm the National Father, intending to use this move to hinder the progress of the Northern Expedition. His crimes of disloyalty, unfilial piety, inhumanity, and injustice are truly countless. However, those who rebelled against the Republic of China ultimately failed, and the National Father, after this "January 16th" ordeal, his personality became more lofty and great, his spirit of overcoming difficulties made people admire him even more, and Chen's insidiousness and baseness were even more hated by the people of the country. It is unimaginable that someone who once scolded Chen Jiongming dared to attempt to rebel during the difficult stage of the War of Resistance. That only invited the unanimous hatred of the whole country, and the War of Resistance of our army became stronger and stronger, and advanced towards a bright future. We must emulate the National Father's spirit of fearlessness in the face of danger, and struggle resolutely. At this time of rampant military force, declining righteousness, war raging, and red blood everywhere, we must shoulder the responsibility of upholding justice, relying on an unshakable belief, and the final victory will surely belong to us!"

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Director Xi Yushu Talks About School Tuition Increases, If it is to Increase Teachers' Salaries, A Moderate Increase in Tuition is Still Reasonable</h3>
<p>Shanghai schools have recently raised tuition due to rising prices and huge expenses, making it difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, several schools have recently decided to increase tuition starting in the 29th year to make up for the deficit. However, increasing tuition is related to education, so a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Director Xi Yushu to inquire about his opinions on Shanghai schools increasing tuition. Mr. Xi gave the following statement: "The prices of all commodities are rising, and the cost of living index is increasing daily. Salaried personnel are all sighing in despair. As a result, strikes and work slowdowns are endless. Labor-management disputes are very serious today, but the result is that wages and subsidies can be increased. Although they cannot match the price increases, the demands are not without small compensations. Only educators bear a great mission and undertake an unexplained burden. I am afraid that there are still few whose income is as high as before July 26th. The income of most teachers has decreased. Therefore, the hardship of teachers' lives is a major problem in today's society. I have checked the salaries of teachers in large, medium, and small schools in the concession area. The lowest is one yuan per hour for universities, four corners for high schools, two corners and five cents for junior high schools, and elementary school teachers who teach more than 20 hours in the morning and evening still do not receive one yuan a day, and it is only calculated for nine months a year. How can this small income offset the endless price increases? Now the wages of road workers and cleaners hired by the Municipal Council are also more than one yuan a day. These are the lowest-level people in society, and what they get is the lowest-level cost of living. Everyone knows that teachers have a great responsibility. If they cannot get the lowest-level cost of living, we should really take urgent action to adjust it so that teachers can concentrate on education. The way to adjust it is to increase teachers' salaries. However, the cost of maintaining the school itself is also experiencing the same difficulties as teachers' lives due to rising prices. To solve this problem, we can only increase income first. The way to increase income should be to increase tuition. However, this matter has always been criticized by society because it is known that schools are educational gardens, not profit-seeking businesses. It must be known that if teachers' lives cannot be maintained, there will be no one willing to be a teacher. Without teachers, there will be no education, and it will be a difficult time for children's education. Therefore, increasing tuition so that teachers can have a reasonable life, that is, children can get reasonable education, is a matter of common sense. However, I also know that a few primary and secondary schools have considerable surpluses every year. If we now advocate increasing graduation fees, it seems that it will further help a few people get rich. However, we should think about the majority and never harm the majority because of the few. I also hope that schools with surpluses should not follow the trend and should use the surplus to increase teacher salaries, so that their contribution to the country and society will be even greater. If we only seek personal enjoyment, such behavior will damage our personality and pollute the education industry. I do not approve of it."</p>

<h3>Mianfu Cup Charity Mini-Football: Hualian and Western Union Draw Yesterday; 3-3 Tie After Extra Time; Samsung Defeats Portuguese Merchants 3-2 in Exhibition Match</h3>
<p>The Mianfu Cup Charity Mini-Football match between Hualian and Western Union took place yesterday at 5:30 PM at the Aurora University Stadium. Over two thousand spectators attended, making it a grand occasion. Hualian led 3-2 in the first half, but the game ended in a 3-3 draw. An additional ten minutes of extra time also resulted in a 3-3 tie. Before the match, there were two preliminary events: the inter-school final, where Xuhui defeated Zhenzhong 7-2 in a dominant performance, and an exhibition match where Samsung narrowly defeated Portuguese Merchants 3-2. Mr. Yuan Ludeng kicked off the charity match, and Mr. Zhang Shanxian presented the awards after the game. In addition to the Mianfu Cup, with both teams' names engraved on it, the captains of both teams each received a silver cup from the China Tea Company.</p>
<p>Samsung Defeats Portuguese Merchants: After the inter-school final, the exhibition match between Samsung and Portuguese Merchants began. Samsung launched a strong attack, with Zhang Mingsheng running tirelessly throughout the field, making particularly active contributions, including scoring two goals. Portuguese Merchants countered, and Remedi scored a goal back. Samsung led 3-2 in the first half. In the second half, both sides engaged in a fierce battle. Remedi's father scored a goal, tying the game at 2-2. Samsung substituted Chen Yuanji for Zhang Mingsheng, and Chen lived up to expectations, securing the victory.

<p>Hualian and Western Union: As the main event, the charity match between Hualian and Western Union, began, the atmosphere became tense. Referee Zhang Le and Yuan Ludeng entered the field first, kicking off the match. Western Union's Xia Mashwei and Markla made their first attempts, and the ball rebounded off the goalpost into the net, only one minute after the start of the game. Faced with this setback, Hualian's Captain Sun took the lead, followed by Mauris, who scored and then lost the ball, making it 1-1. In the sixth minute, a strong kick caused Kehou to rush forward and shoot, hitting the crossbar and falling down. Fafanxiao charged up, dribbled the ball, and scored, making it 2-2, once again equalizing. Two minutes later, Long Haiyao passed the ball, and Jim inadvertently saved the ball, resulting in an own goal. Hualian thus benefited. Afterwards, Jim and Lingen committed consecutive fouls and were penalized with a nine-yard kick. Jin Shun ceded the shot, and Su Ruo imitated him, but both failed to score. Hualian led 3-3 in the first half. As the second half began, ten minutes in, Cai Shengsen suddenly committed a foul inside the penalty area, and Jim took the nine-yard kick, scoring with a powerful shot. With the score tied, both sides pressed even harder. Long Hai made several attempts to score, but his shots lacked precision. Tong Yu was repeatedly injured, and Shaotai acted as goalkeeper. As time ran out, no winner could be determined. An extra ten minutes yielded no further results, and the game ended in a 3-3 draw.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Difficulties and Struggling Hard: Those Who Strive Will Surely Triumph; Today is the Anniversary of the Premier's Calamity; All Sectors Solemnly Commemorate with Suspended Ceremonies; City Party Headquarters and Three Youth Leagues Encourage Compatriots</h3>
<p>Today marks the 18th anniversary of the Premier's Calamity in Guangzhou. According to central regulations, the two anniversaries of the Premier's Calamity in Guangzhou on June 16th and the London Calamity on October 11th will be combined and held simultaneously on September 9th, the anniversary of the Premier's First Uprising. Although the city's sectors will not hold ceremonies, they will unanimously observe a moment of silence to commemorate the event with solemnity. The City Party Headquarters and the Three Principles of the People Youth League have each issued proclamations to the public. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Emulate the Premier and Strive for Victory</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the Father of the Nation's Calamity in Guangzhou. Given the special environment in Shanghai, no commemorative ceremonies will be held. However, recalling that the Premier suffered calamity in Guangzhou eighteen years ago today due to the rebellion of Chen Jiongming, lasting over fifty days, despite being in an extremely dangerous situation, he was ultimately able to remain steadfast and unyielding. Therefore, in addition to solemnly commemorating the event, all sectors are determined to emulate the Premier's spirit of fearlessness, work hard for the war of resistance and national reconstruction, strive for final victory, and complete independence and liberation.</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters Encourages Citizens to Fight</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a proclamation to the citizens for the anniversary of the Premier's Calamity in Guangzhou, stating: "At this time when the global situation is rapidly deteriorating and our country's war of resistance is transitioning from a stalemate to a period of arduous counter-offensive, it is especially meaningful for us to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the Father of the Nation's calamity on this isolated island surrounded by evil forces."</p>
<p>Revolutionary Traitors Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>"We recall that after the Premier swore an oath in Shaoguan to launch the Northern Expedition, the revolutionary army captured Ganzhou in one fell swoop, with plans to head straight for Nanchang and advance north across the Yangtze River. Who would have known that Chen Jiongming, a soldier personally promoted and entrusted with the heavy responsibility of revolution by the Premier, would lead his troops in rebellion, attempting to harm the Premier, obstruct the progress of the Northern Expedition, and destroy the success of the revolution. However, as time progressed, traitors who hindered the revolution ultimately failed, and the great cause of the Northern Expedition, after a setback, finally progressed smoothly and achieved success."</p>
<p>Great Personality Awakens the National Spirit</p>
<p>"At that time, the Premier faced unimaginable worries and hardships due to Chen Jiongming's rebellion from within. However, he boarded a warship and confronted the rebel army for over fifty days, never succumbing to violence. The Premier's spirit of not fearing the powerful, not fearing violence, and struggling arduously, as well as his determination to uphold the law, fulfill his responsibilities, and not lightly abandon his post, regardless of life, death, success, or failure, were sufficient to save China's dying national spirit and promote the success of the revolution. From then on, the people of the entire country recognized the Premier's spirit of serving the country with hardship and unanimously leaned towards the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>
<p>The Situation Then and Now is Exactly the Same</p>
<p>"We also recall that during every arduous process of revolution, there are always traitors rising from within. Chen Jiongming in the past and the current traitors are exactly the same. However, Chen's rebellion was thwarted by the Premier's perseverance and resilience. Although Chen temporarily prevailed, he ultimately perished, and the great cause of the Northern Expedition, although temporarily obstructed, ultimately succeeded. And now, the traitors' rebellion has been thwarted by the President's wisdom and decisiveness. Furthermore, Chen Jiongming's crime was colluding with the Northern Warlords to obstruct the National Revolution, while the current traitors dare to sign secret pacts and sell out the country and nation when the strong enemy has invaded deeply and the nation and people have reached a critical juncture. However, the Premier's personality becomes even greater due to Chen's assassination attempt, and the revolution's grand cause progresses even faster due to Chen's destruction. This is something that those who labor in vain and grow clumsy would never have foreseen. Now, the belief of the entire nation, from top to bottom, that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built has not been shaken by the traitors' willingness to be lackeys. The spirit of sincere unity and shared hatred of the enemy has not been dissipated by the shameless puppets taking the stage. This is also something that they would never have foreseen."</p>
<p>Precious Lessons are Exciting</p>
<p>"After the Premier escaped the calamity, he issued a declaration from Guangdong to Shanghai, concluding: 'All who are loyal to the Republic of China are to be treated as friends; those who are disloyal to the Republic of China are to be treated as enemies. Wherever righteousness lies, we must strive together. We must not fear danger or hardship, nor fear power. We must complete the construction of the Republic of China so that all the people may enjoy its benefits and our responsibility will be fulfilled.' In a letter to comrades in the party, he concluded: 'Only after a strong wind can we know the sturdy grass; only after intertwined roots can we distinguish sharp instruments. At this time, my comrades, we must especially endure hardship and difficulty. The final victory always belongs to those who strive to the end.' Are these not the most valuable lessons for us now?"</p>
<p>Support the President and Continue to Strive</p>
<p>"Therefore, as we solemnly commemorate the Premier's calamity today, we must emulate the Premier's fearless spirit of overcoming difficulties, we must firmly believe that the Three Principles of the People are the compass for saving the nation, we must support the guidance of the Supreme Leader, President Chiang, and we must support the national policy of the war of resistance and national reconstruction. If we strive arduously and continue to work hard, then the final victory will surely belong to us."</p>
<p>Three Youth Leagues Issue Proclamation to the Youth</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League issued a proclamation to the youth of Shanghai, stating: "Youths of the city, today is the anniversary of the Father of the Nation's Calamity in Guangzhou. This calamity of the Father of the Nation was caused by the anti-revolutionary large group, the Northern Warlords, who meticulously attempted to eliminate revolutionary forces, but ultimately failed. Therefore, they used internal spies within the revolutionary ranks to harm the</p>
<p>Revolutionary Leader</p>
<p>and realize their dream of eliminating revolutionary forces. Although the revolutionary forces encountered extreme obstruction due to this vicious conspiracy, the revolutionary cause must be tempered through hardships to be completed. Therefore, the revolutionary elements, regardless of all difficulties, continued to work tirelessly, making the</p>
<p>Revolutionary Forces</p>
<p>more widespread and deeply rooted in every corner of China, eventually wiping out the rebellious elements. All the warlord forces also collapsed one after another. Today, the Japanese, unable to achieve their goal of conquering China by force despite the heroic resistance of revolutionary soldiers, have bought over the dregs of the nation, the traitors of the revolution, and are attempting to divide our revolutionary forces and shake our war of resistance front. As we recall the historical lessons of the Father of the Nation's Calamity in Guangzhou, as long as we</p>
<p>Disregard Hardship</p>
<p>and continue to work hard, we firmly believe that the rebellious elements will inevitably be eliminated, the Japanese warlords will inevitably collapse, and the revolutionary forces, after this tempering, will certainly have a brighter future. Do not be discouraged, do not be timid. History shows us that the revolutionary ranks are always victorious."</p>
<h3>Chinese Propaganda Sold in Hongkou Area; Japanese Consulate Police Arrest One Person; Return of Hongkou Police Authority Not Yet Implemented</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" stated that a Chinese vendor was selling Chinese propaganda materials to Japanese soldiers in the Hongkou District. The vendor, named Jiang Wenqi (transliteration), a resident of Jiangxi Road, was arrested by the police of the Japanese Consulate on Wusong Road on Thursday afternoon. Jiang told the Japanese police that he was instructed by anti-Japanese elements in Shanghai to carry and sell postcards printed with photos of Chinese military activities to Japanese officers and soldiers. At the time of his arrest, over a hundred of these postcards were confiscated. The police department of the Japanese Consulate is currently investigating the instigators behind the arrested person.</p>
<p>Increase in Theft Cases</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army has repeatedly interfered with the implementation of police authority in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou Creek by the Shanghai Municipal Council, all criminals have used this area as a refuge. Since the Board of Directors and the Japanese Consulate negotiated on March 1st of this year and reached an agreement at the request of the Japanese side, with a Japanese national appointed as the District Chief of District E, the police authority has been completely handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for implementation. However, it has been three months since then, and this matter has not yet been implemented. The general residents are deeply concerned about the increase in theft cases.</p>
<h3>Japanese Peace Overtures Aimed at Coping with Political Turmoil; Cabinet Overthrow Movement Brewing Domestically; Attempting to Exploit European Situation for Self-Enrichment; China Adheres to War of Resistance Policy</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the latest issue of the Miller's Review of the Far East stated that Tokyo is deeply afraid that the war with China will drag on for too long, and that a violent political coup may occur within the Japanese government. Therefore, it has sent unofficial representatives to Hong Kong in a vain attempt to hold peace talks with representatives of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Serious Events in Progress</p>
<p>Japan's political situation is unstable due to economic difficulties and the current Prime Minister Yonai's failure to end the "China Incident," and a major political turmoil may be brewing. The nature and significance of this turmoil may be comparable to the famous February 26th Incident in 1936, in which lower-ranking officers of the Japanese army assassinated members of the Okada cabinet. Furthermore, Japan is eager to exploit the European situation for its own enrichment, but the continuing war with China is a major obstacle. If Japan were free to act, it might have already decided to collude with Hitler and Mussolini.</p>
<p>Criticizing the Government's War with China</p>
<p>Japanese militarists are now coveting Hong Kong, Singapore, and especially the Dutch East Indies. However, with the war with China continuing indefinitely, the Japanese militarists may not dare to embark on new adventures. Therefore, the article listed recent significant events in the Japanese political situation, stating that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are trying to regroup and interfere with government policies, and that the Japanese Diet meeting at the beginning of this year strongly criticized official policies, especially those related to the war with China. This has not been heard in the Japanese Diet for a long time.</p>
<p>Political Parties United Against Militarists</p>
<p>Japan has recently begun a movement to establish a single political party, with former Prime Minister Konoe as the party leader. The underlying motive of this movement is that opposing political parties want to unite and oppose the militarists. Currently, the militarists have absolute power, and their aimless policies are the biggest obstacle to resolving the "China Incident." Mr. Kuhara, who has long supported the "One Country, One Party" plan, has resigned from his position as cabinet advisor, which may trigger a crisis.</p>
<p>China's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency happened to meet a Westerner who had recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and took the opportunity to ask him if he had heard anything about the Japanese peace offensive while in Hong Kong. He replied that he had many well-known Chinese friends in Hong Kong, who all said that since December of last year, there have been no so-called advocates of peace in Chongqing, and they have unanimously adhered to the national policy of resistance. They will never hope for peace until the Japanese army withdraws from China. They often said that the senior party and government officials in Chongqing all adhere to a single diplomatic policy, which is to strive for multifaceted international assistance from a neutral standpoint, and not to absolutely favor one side to the detriment of others. These senior party and government officials certainly include those who know Japan well and often contribute their conclusions from studying Japan to the Supreme Leader. However, their conclusions precisely point out the fact that Japan's national power is declining day by day, which boosts confidence in the victory of the war of resistance. The gentleman further said that when he was saying goodbye to a certain famous Chinese personage in Hong Kong, the European war issue was discussed, which aroused the interest of the famous personage in commenting on the Sino-Japanese issue. He said that Japan at this time is extremely eager to extricate itself from the quagmire of the war against China in order to seek the beautiful scenery it encountered in the last war, but it does not have the courage to completely withdraw its troops from China. Therefore, it constantly spreads peace messages to comfort itself, which only increases its troubles.</p>
<h3>Neutrality of the Concessions Will Never Change; All Conspiracies Will Be Shattered</h3>
<p>The precarious state in the concessions caused by Italy's entry into the war has been swept away as various countries garrisoned troops to protect the safety of the concessions, reaching agreements and strictly abiding by them, and making various possible efforts. Not only has the haze been completely swept away, but the facts in recent days have also proven that the neutrality of the Shanghai concessions has been established. All rumors, slanders, and disruptions by those with ulterior motives have largely died out on their own, and people generally ignore them.</p>
<p>The Dream of a Madman of Chuan Xia'an</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post stated: "Mayor" Chuan Xia'an recently issued a proclamation demanding that all troops stationed in Shanghai from the warring countries withdraw completely, saying that he is drafting a formal request that will be submitted to the Consular Body and the Standing Bureau of the troops stationed in Shanghai from the warring countries. In addition, any transfer of its privileges in China by one of the warring countries to another without permission is invalid.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries to Conduct Final Accounts and Take a Two-Day Holiday as Usual</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industries Association has decided that July 1st (Monday) and 2nd (Tuesday) will be the "Semi-Annual Final Account," with a two-day holiday as usual. Business will resume as usual on the 3rd. The Board of Directors of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have decided to first issue dividends for commercial shares for the 28th year, calculated at 7%, and then submit them for ratification at the shareholders' meeting, scheduled to begin on July 11th. The suggestion to take a one-day holiday after the interest settlement is still under discussion, but the holiday schedule for member banks for the 29th year of the Republic of China has already been set and announced, so it is not convenient to change it.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Denies Price Increase Rumors; Substantial Surplus Last Year; Bureau Receives Petition</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that telephone fees in Shanghai will be increased. The general public believes that the telephone company's business has been very developed in recent years, and it also had a considerable surplus last year, so there seems to be no need to increase prices. If there is such a proposal, it is hoped that the concession authorities and the company will consider it and not increase the burden on residents. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired about this matter with the Shanghai Municipal Council. Since the price increase of public utilities in the concessions must be reviewed and approved by the Council, the Council has not yet received an application from the telephone company requesting an increase.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Suspends Flights and Mail Delivery; Post Office Officially Announces; Brazilian Parcels Must Be Declared for Tax</h3>
<p>The suspension of British Royal Air Mail flights due to the outbreak of the Mediterranean war was reported in the 本月14日本報 (this newspaper on the 14th of this month). Now, according to Announcement No. 1611 from the Shanghai Postal Administration: "Upon investigation, the British Royal Air Mail and Qantas Airways have suspended flights. The Bureau will temporarily suspend the acceptance and delivery of airmail transported by aircraft on the routes of these two companies. This is hereby announced to inform the public." It is understood that the routes of the Royal Airlines transport mail to Indochina, Malaya, Siam, Burma, India, Africa, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and Europe. Aircraft depart from Hong Kong, via Bangkok to London, and from Hong Kong via Bangkok and Singapore to Australia. Aircraft depart from Hong Kong every Wednesday and can reach London in eight days. Currently, airmail to various European and American countries is transported by United Airlines, Air France, and KLM. It is also understood that from today, all parcels sent to Brazil, large and small, must be accompanied by two customs tax declaration forms. The names and detailed addresses of the sender and receiver, as well as the quantity and weight of the goods, must be clearly stated. The Bureau will issue an announcement.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Spokesman Clarifies Policy Towards China: Unchanged as Before; Shanghai Situation to Remain Status Quo</h3>
<p>Amidst the tense atmosphere of the European War, the British policy towards the Far East has been the subject of various rumors, leaving people in a state of confusion. The Tianjin silver issue and the establishment of an agreement have further fueled speculation. A reporter from Píngmíng News Agency specifically visited a British Consulate spokesman to inquire about everything. The British Consulate spokesman responded with utmost sincerity, stating that British policy towards China remains the same as before, with no changes whatsoever. It will continue to maintain its interests in China and will not give them up. Currently, Britain and France are fighting side by side against Nazi aggression, just as China is engaged in the war of resistance. Although the situation may suffer temporary setbacks, we firmly believe that we will eventually achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Tianjin Agreement to be Announced Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the Tianjin Concession silver issue, it is said that an agreement has been reached and will be formally announced in a week. However, the agreement requires further clarification. The British authorities, in the current circumstances, have had to make this move out of necessity. However, they firmly believe that it will benefit all parties. Of the total amount of silver held in trust by the Tianjin Concession authorities, only one-tenth will be sold to the Sterling Area, and the proceeds will also be used within the Sterling Area. Its use is limited to refugee relief and other public works, such as dike construction for disaster prevention. Everything is for the sake of local public welfare.</p>
<p>Unwarranted Arrests Not True</p>
<p>Regarding reports that Japanese police can enter the British Concession in Tianjin at any time to arrest so-called "terrorists," this is inaccurate. According to the agreement, if the Japanese police authorities discover so-called "terrorists" hiding in the British Concession or committing criminal acts, they must notify the Concession authorities. Only after the latter send someone to investigate and confirm the facts can they arrest and hand them over. This measure has been implemented in the Shanghai Concession for some time. To maintain law and order and avoid disputes, this arrangement has been made.</p>
<p>Shanghai Situation: No Need for Unfounded Worries</p>
<p>The spokesman further stated that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, has already left Hong Kong for Shanghai and is on his way. He may arrive here in two or three days. After a short rest in Shanghai, it is currently undecided whether he will go to North China immediately. The reporter further inquired whether the situation in Shanghai is concerning after the expansion of the European War and Italy's entry into the war. The spokesman said that the status quo in Shanghai will not change, and there is no need for unfounded worries. As for Hong Kong, the rumors of a tense situation and widespread panic are completely unreliable. People who are overly sensitive are misled by rumors and live in constant anxiety, which is no different from self-inflicted trouble. As far as he knows, Hong Kong's defenses are extremely solid. The authorities have planned and prepared everything to resist any external attacks. There are no other unusual circumstances that can be reported.</p>

<h3>The Entire French Community in This City Sends Off Young Men Enlisting; British Aeronautical Society Bids Farewell to Lieutenant Commander Sackville; Italian Flag Removed at the Farewell Banquet</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, the French Veterans Association of Shanghai held a tea party yesterday (the 15th) at 6:30 PM at the French Concession Police Headquarters to see off young French men who had been called up for military service and were about to leave Shanghai to return to Vietnam to participate in the war. At the same time, they also took the opportunity to welcome new Belgian members who had recently joined the association. The French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, and the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Orin, were invited to be honorary chairmen of the meeting. Mr. Cosme and Mr. Orin attended, and Colonel Aisody, commander of the French forces in China, Mr. Adiego, commander of the French forces in Shanghai, and members of the Veterans Association served as hosts.</p>
<p>General Speeches</p>
<p>First, Mr. Eagar, president of the French Veterans Association, gave a speech welcoming the ambassador, Belgian members, and young men enlisting for taking time out of their busy schedules to attend. He expressed his gratitude to all members and the entire French community for their enthusiastic donations to the national defense fund and expressed his deep belief that France would achieve final victory. The betrayal of friendly forces and the serious losses would not shake its determination. Then, Ambassador Cosme gave a speech, encouraging the young men enlisting to take on the glorious mission like the soldiers of 1914.</p>
<p>Recovering Paris</p>
<p>All the white-haired brothers (referring to veterans) present place high hopes on them for revenge for France. The difficult environment will never harm the spirit of France. On the contrary, after tempering, its brilliance will become even greater. Ambassador Cosme finally stated that the Ambassador's wife launched a fundraising campaign for the French Red Cross, which raised 700,000 yuan in just a few days. Not only the French community and the expatriates from the Allied countries donated, but also the expatriates from all countries in Shanghai and people from all walks of life were concerned about and happy to donate to France's resistance and struggle. A country in the world like France can shoulder difficulties and will never perish.</p>
<p>After the French Ambassador finished his speech, the audience shouted "Long live France." The French Ambassador then shook hands with and bid farewell to the French men who were about to leave Shanghai. The young men immediately launched a fundraising campaign for the French Red Cross. Everyone present generously donated. It is reported that the French Red Cross will begin an expanded fundraising campaign today. It is also reported that yesterday (the 14th) at 8:15 AM, the French community held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers at the church on Rue Luban. Ambassador Cosme and his wife, Consul General Orin and his wife, and prominent figures from the French community attended the ceremony. The mass was presided over by Father Boussait, who prayed for the souls of the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>British Banquet</p>
<p>The five British aviation associations held a luncheon at the HSBC Building to bid farewell to Lieutenant Commander Cecil Sackville, the Canadian Trade Representative, who was scheduled to return home today for instructions. One thing that was noteworthy at the banquet that day was that all the members present expressed great indignation at Italy's declaration of war on England.</p>
<p>Quite indignant</p>
<p>They took down the Italian flag from the flags of all nations hanging in the center of the hall. Therefore, the Italian flag was not seen at the banquet. At the banquet, Sir Sassoon gave a welcoming speech first. He hoped that Commander Sackville would return here as soon as possible and presented him with a silver cigarette holder on behalf of all the members as a souvenir. Then, Commander Sackville gave a reply. He also hoped to return to Shanghai as soon as possible, but he was a soldier.</p>
<p>Dedication to the Military</p>
<p>He was willing to serve the Kingdom of England as a reservist. Mr. Mai also expressed his wishes to the members of the Royal Family who had requested to return home to participate in the war.</p>
<p>Belgian Donations</p>
<p>In addition, the Belgian Legation in China announced the amount of donations recently donated by all sectors of society to the Belgian Red Cross. It is said that the amount in legal tender is 118,960.50 yuan, 127,681.25 Belgian francs, 3,500 French francs, 39 British pounds, and 1,349.91 US dollars.</p>
<p>U.S. Ship Movements</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet gunboats USS Luzon and USS Wake Island sailed to Hankou, Wuhu, and other ports two weeks ago. Yesterday (the 14th) morning, they returned to Shanghai and docked at the Bund outside the French Concession. They will likely be moved to the opposite side of the Yangshupu Dock. It is reported that the three U.S. ships USS Luzon, USS Guam, and USS Isabel left Shanghai on May 31. USS Isabel has recently returned here, while USS Guam is still in Hankou.</p>
<p>American Student Test</p>
<p>Shanghai American School recently held a test, and the question was: "Should the United States ignore the further development of the European situation and remain aloof, or should the United States only provide material and economic assistance to the Allies without participating in manpower?" The results of the test showed that most students advocated that the United States should participate in the European War when necessary. It can be seen from this that the psychological state of the students of Shanghai American School regarding the issue of American participation in the war is more inclined to belligerency than when the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post held this test last fall. However, according to the statistics of the test results, it proves that although the students of Shanghai American School hope that the United States will assist the Allies to the greatest extent possible, they do not want to participate in the war immediately.</p>
<h3>Stallholders Continue to be Punished</h3>
<p>Four stallholders in the Hongkou market, Min Zhaolong, Hu Xiaolong, Zhao Genji, and Hu Heshang, etc., were fined ten yuan each by the court on the 7th of this month for failing to affix the lottery label after being sued by the Public Works Department. In addition, three stallholders in the market, Liu Weiji, Shi Heshang, and Zhao Longbao, etc., were each fined ten yuan by the court on the 14th of this month for the same incident as a warning.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Conte Verde Prepares to Dock in Shanghai for a Long Time; The Company Maintains Strict Secrecy on Telegrams; Russian Empress Liner Arrives in Shanghai with Crowds of Passengers from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The scope of the European war is gradually expanding, and the situation is becoming more and more severe. Since Italy's participation in the war, the Mediterranean has also been affected, and the entrance to the Suez Canal has been blockaded by the British Navy. Mediterranean navigation has been completely cut off. The Italian postal ship Conte Verde, which arrived in Shanghai on the 6th, moved from the Kung Hoong Wharf to buoys 16 and 17 on the morning of the 12th to prepare for indefinite docking in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Cargo Ships Passing India</p>
<p>Another cargo ship, Foscari, sailed from Genoa to the Far East at the beginning of last month. It passed Karachi, India, on the 22nd of last month and went to Singapore and Saigon. It was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the middle of this month. Because Italy has declared war on England and France, there is no news about the current voyage of the cargo ship. As for the Shanghai side, the company has handled external telegrams on its own, and there is no way to inquire about anything. Although the Central European route will not be interrupted, the number of voyages has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Navigation Uninterrupted</p>
<p>The French Company's D'Artagnan postal ship, which came from Europe to Shanghai and went to Japan at the end of last month, has returned to Shanghai from Japan this morning and docked at the Shuntak Wharf in Hongkou. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai today and return to Europe. The Changxing Company's Russian Empress postal ship is scheduled to return from Little Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai at 10:00 AM today. It will dock at the Kung Hoong Wharf in Hongkou. The passenger ferry will arrive at the New Customs Wharf to disembark passengers at about 11:30 this morning. The Russian Empress liner is scheduled to leave the port at 5:00 PM today, passing through Kobe, Yokohama, and Honolulu and returning to Vancouver. The ship will only stay in Shanghai for six hours this time. It is said that many passengers were intercepted from Hong Kong, and there is even talk of being full.</p>
<p>Voyage Changes</p>
<p>The U.S. President Lines's world-class postal ship SS Garfield left the dock at 4:45 PM yesterday and departed from the Wusong Port at 5:00 PM, heading to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Singapore, Colombo, Penang, and Mumbai, then taking the Cape of Good Hope, passing through South Africa, and returning to New York. The Norwegian ship Tijuca, managed by Thoresen &amp; Co., is scheduled to go to Europe today, also via Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, the Cape of Good Hope, and French Morocco. It is reported that a large amount of Chinese tea, about 700 tons, will be transported there.</p>
<p>Ferries Continue to Operate</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the shipping industry in Shanghai has recently been quite concerned about the shipping schedule of Italian ships in Shanghai after Italy's participation in the war. It has been learned that several small ships flying the Italian flag that travel between Shanghai, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and nearby ports will continue to operate as usual. There are currently four large Italian merchant ships docked in Shanghai, which may be moored until the end of the war. One is the Italian Postal Shipping Company's Conte Verde, docked at buoys 16 and 17. There are about 100 Italians and Chinese on board, mostly crew members. The other three ships are the Zhongyi Shipping Company's Antuita, Alba, and Peconsorini. The Italian gunboats Carlo Tuo and Lemanto are also docked in the Huangpu River opposite the Taikoo Dock.</p>
<h3>Prices in the French Concession Frequently Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, the value of legal tender has greatly strengthened, but the prices of several commodities in Shanghai have still increased without decreasing. The commodities with price increases in the French Concession are more numerous than in the International Settlement. This phenomenon has been a new development for several weeks. Of the 83 items in the French Concession, 24 have increased in price, 18 of which are even higher than the prices in the International Settlement south of the Suzhou Creek. There are 14 kinds of commodities with lower prices in the two concessions. The prices of 19 items in Hongkou are higher than those in the British and French Concessions, while the prices of fruits, fish, meat, and vegetables are cheaper.</p>
<h3>The Paint Workers' Strike Remains Unresolved; Another Wave Arises Yesterday; Workers Turn Their Anger on the Shop Owner; Employers Plan to Close Down</h3>
<p>The Xu Fa Ji signboard paint shop at 473 Jiujiang Road in the International Settlement suddenly experienced a strike riot yesterday afternoon. According to a visit by a Píngmíng News Agency reporter, after more than 7,000 paint workers in the city went on strike on the 6th of the month due to demands for improved treatment that were not met, labor and management held negotiations on the 14th, but ultimately there were no results due to differences of opinion. The Public Works Department sent personnel to convene representatives from labor and management at 3:00 PM yesterday to hold mediation. The employers offered to increase the salary to 1.85 yuan per person per day, but the workers did not agree. More than 60 striking workers waiting for news in the Xu Fa Ji paint shop turned their anger on the shop owner, Xu Gongpei, because Xu was one of the employer representatives. They destroyed the shop's signboard, tools, and raw materials. After hearing the news, the employers, believing that the workers were not observing order, demanded that the Public Works Department severely punish the workers before all paint shops in the city announced a shutdown of business starting this morning.</p>
<h3>French Authorities Announce Caution Against Impersonation for Fraud</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council announced that recently there have been several people who claim to be Municipal Council staff and go to taxpayers' homes in an attempt to defraud money. To this end, it is hereby notified to all residents in the French Concession that whenever small bureau personnel go to collect money, they must wait until they have presented their identity certificate with a number and photo before paying. At the same time, it is necessary to ask them for an official receipt that matches the amount paid.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners Association in Shanghai Forms Shaoshan Civil Food Relief Association; Fundraising of 2 Million Yuan, 300,000 Yuan Already Pledged; Zhejiang Chairman Cables Reply, Resolving to Purchase Foreign Rice for Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>The rice shortage in Ningbo and Shaoxing is becoming increasingly serious. Sojourners in Shanghai are separately mobilizing to raise funds and purchase large quantities of foreign rice to transport to their hometowns for relief. In order to expand its efforts, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners Association in Shanghai specially organized the Shaoshan Civil Food Relief Association, which held its inaugural meeting at its clubhouse on Elgin Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The fundraising target is about 2 million national currency yuan. Yesterday, enthusiastic people pledged 300,000 yuan on the spot.

<h3>Principal of the Sixth Month Telecom Public Bonds Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation previously issued 10 million national currency yuan of Telecom Public Bonds in 1935 for the purpose of expanding telegraph, telephone, and wireless communications. It stipulated that the principal and interest would be repaid once every month in March, June, September, and December. The international reporting fee income of the Ministry of Transportation was designated as the principal and interest fund. Now, the 19th lottery redemption of the public bonds has been drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee, totaling 300,000 yuan for principal redemption. However, due to the interception of international reporting fee income by the Japanese, the redemption of the public bonds has been inevitably decided to be temporarily suspended. Therefore, the principal of the public bonds due on June 30 has not been ordered to be paid by the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications has not been ordered to pay them. As for the bondholders, due to the extraordinary circumstances, there are no objections to the government's measures.</p>

<h3>Son of Tea and Food Giant Accused of Adultery; Abandoning Wife and Forming a New Nest with a Dancer; Arrested and Detained, Both Released on Bail Pending Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Chen Xinjie (27 years old this year), the son of Chen Jiro, who owns the largest number of Lao Dafang, Tianlu, and Ye Biji tea and food candy stores in Shanghai, and is the leader in the industry, is the accountant at the Ye Biji candy store on Xiahui Road, Hualong Road. In 1934, he married Cao Junying (27 years old this year), a woman from the same hometown, at the Shanghai Customs Office. They have one son</p>
<p>One child of each gender</p>
<p>The son's name is Huizhong (4 years old), and the daughter's name is Huiyan (2 years old). They have always lived together. However, since August of last year, Chen has frequently visited singing and dancing halls, resulting in an inextricable relationship with the dancer Lu Yangxia (25 years old this year). He then built a golden house to keep his beauty in Lane 7, Shanqingfang, Kangdi Road, in the French Concession. From then on, Chen abandoned his wife who had gone through thick and thin with him and did not provide any living expenses for his children. Ms. Cao once filed a lawsuit against Chen in the Civil Court of the Second Branch of the Shanghai District Court, requesting cohabitation and payment of living expenses, demanding 200 yuan per month in living expenses. As a result, the two parties' mediation failed. Ms. Cao was preparing to file a formal lawsuit when she discovered that her husband</p>
<p>Formed a New Relationship</p>
<p>and was hiding her lover. Without making a sound, she secretly reported to the French Police at 6:30 AM yesterday. The Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to Lane 7, Shanqingfang, to arrest Chen and his lover Lu Yingxia and take them to the police station, along with the exquisite opium lamps and pipes that were seized. In the afternoon, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Branch of the Shanghai District Court. Yao Zhao, a lawyer from the police station, filed a lawsuit based on the crime of adultery. The plaintiff's lawyers, Yuan Hanyun and Wu Xiaolin, requested to file a civil suit as an attachment, and the subject matter was temporarily reserved. When questioned, both defendants</p>
<p>Admitted to Cohabitation</p>
<p>Both defendants admitted that the plaintiff knew about it in advance and could not be said to be adultery. Judge Qiu Huanxuan added a question, saying, "Since the plaintiff knew about your adultery in advance and had acquiesced, why would she come to sue you? Moreover, you have children at home and should not have gone astray." The case was adjourned to the 22nd for further hearing. Both defendants were released on bail of 2,000 yuan each with reliable shopkeepers, and the two defendants were ordered to be examined by a forensic doctor to determine whether they were addicted to opium before further review.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Closure of the Western Shanghai Gambling Dens; Remains to be Proven by Facts</h3>
<p>According to the Dachung News Agency, the "puppet" side announced that all gambling dens and opium dens in the western suburbs of Shanghai were scheduled to close yesterday. However, according to observations by people concerned about the moral movement, it is doubtful whether this announcement can be realized. The puppet side has announced the closure of gambling dens in the western suburbs of Shanghai more than once, but as a result, the gambling dens continue to "operate as usual." According to informed sources, the puppet "Police Chief" Lu Ying issued an "order" limiting all gambling dens and opium dens in the western suburbs of Shanghai to close their doors for good yesterday. However, Shanghai observers, in view of the puppet side deceiving themselves and slapping themselves in the face repeatedly, hold the attitude of "seeing is believing." It is found that there are still eight gambling dens operating in the western suburbs of Shanghai, and the number of opium dens is three times that of a year ago.</p>
<p>According to the Píngmíng News Agency, the gambling dens in the western suburbs of Shanghai were originally scheduled to close at 12:00 last night, but during the day, the gambling dens were still frantic as usual, showing no signs of closing. However, according to rumors from all sides, in order to save face for the puppet side, they had to close down uniformly and then use other names to revive them in the future. According to another saying, the gambling dens have reached an agreement with all parties and can be extended for another six months and will not die prematurely. The truth remains to be proven by facts, because although there was a saying that they would close at the end of May, it was still not implemented. The situation inside is something that outsiders cannot know the details of.</p>
<p>According to the Shekai News Agency, it was once rumored that the gambling dens in the western suburbs of Shanghai would close uniformly on the 31st of last month, but then it was rumored that it would be extended to the 15th of this month and that they would no longer continue and would be ordered to close uniformly. At that time, it was generally expected that this statement was unreliable and was nothing more than a deliberate release of air. As expected, yesterday was the deadline, but the gambling dens not only showed no signs of closing, but were</p>
<p>More Brillant,</p>
<p>Far better than before, and it is learned that there is a possibility of prolonged existence in the future. That is to say, the Shanghai people who hoped to eliminate these gambling dens as soon as possible now know that they have eaten their words.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping for Ransom; Two Perpetrators Sentenced to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Zhou Xilian (father's name Xiangsheng), who served as a captain under a certain organization, recently colluded with his subordinates Ni Wenhuan and others to kidnap the owner of the Gongyi Leather Factory at 1097 Kangnaot Road at 10:30 PM on April 8 of this year and extort a ransom of 33,500 yuan. Zhou and Ni were arrested by Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession's Gordon Road Police Station at the Jinlong Hotel and sent to the First Special District Court, where they were prosecuted for kidnapping for ransom. After the interrogation, the facts were clear. Yesterday, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Division 2 announced the verdict in this case. Zhou Xilian and Ni Wenhuan were sentenced to 12 years in prison each and deprived of public rights for 10 years each for kidnapping with the intent to extort a ransom. One forged instruction was confiscated, and 650 yuan in legal tender and 100 yuan in American dollars were returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Collapse of Yue Opera Theater: Tragedy with Multiple Injuries and Deaths; Electrical Fan Malfunction Causes Panic Among Audience; Floorboards Break, Leading to Total Collapse</h3>
<p>The Long Yuan Yue Opera Theater, located upstairs from the Tianlai Bathhouse in Xinmin Village, Ailai Ge Road, in the French Concession, and operated by Shen Jinfu, Wu Yuelin, and others (four in total), experienced a tragedy last night. At approximately 9:45 PM, during a performance of "The Legend of the White Snake," an electrical fan in the venue suddenly malfunctioned, causing flashes of light. The male and female audience members panicked and rushed towards the stairs in an attempt to escape. However, the building was old and dilapidated, and had not been properly maintained for years. Unable to bear the weight, the floorboards collapsed layer by layer, affecting the roof, which immediately caved in. More than a dozen men and women were injured on the spot, three or four of whom died shortly after due to the severity of their injuries. Following the incident, the police authorities quickly dispatched ambulances to the scene and transported the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the female owner of the theater, Shen Wu, and her younger sister and children were also severely injured, and their lives are in danger.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters Sentenced to Severe Penalties</h3>
<p>Zhou Honglin, a Chinese detective inspector at the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police, along with Detective Captain Song Bingzheng, Detective Lang Guangchun, and others, recently cracked a large-scale counterfeiting operation at 594 Ya'er Pei Road in the French Concession. Three individuals from Anhui and Jiangsu provinces were apprehended, including Zhao Shida from Anhui, Li Jinbo from Danyang, and Zhang Rongda from Changzhou. Confiscated items included 20,000 yuan in counterfeit five-yuan notes from the Bank of China, 400 counterfeit two-jiao fractional currency notes from the Central Bank, two large machines, five printing plates, nineteen photographic copper plates, three printing stones, and a large quantity of unfinished counterfeit banknotes. Several other key suspects, including Zhang Kui, Li Guoying, and Bao Daoliang, are still at large. The case was transferred to the Special First Court, which has already concluded its hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xietang of the criminal division announced the sentencing. Zhao Shida and Zhang Rongda were each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for conspiring to use counterfeit currency, along with a fine of 2,000 yuan, and deprivation of public rights for ten years. Li Jinbo was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for the same crime, along with a fine of 1,000 yuan, and deprivation of public rights for eight years. If the fines are not paid, they will be converted to labor service based on the ratio of the total amount to the number of six-month periods. All confiscated items will be forfeited according to the list.</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out in Cotton Cargo Hold on Giant Shanghai-Bound Ship; Thousands of Bales of Cotton Destroyed by Fire and Water Damage</h3>
<p>The giant British company ship "Elipoo," recently arrived at the Qichang Dock in Pudong, was loaded with tens of thousands of bales of cotton. Yesterday, at approximately 11:00 AM, while unloading cargo, thick smoke suddenly began to rise from a pile of cotton in the fourth cargo hold. A dockworker in the cargo hold, aware of the highly flammable nature of cotton, quickly climbed out of the hatch to avoid danger. Within five minutes, the fire spread rapidly, engulfing the entire hold. Dense smoke poured out of the hatch. The fire chief of the dock, Zhao Longsheng, urgently drove his own fire engine to the dock and began spraying water to extinguish the fire. Half an hour later, two fireboats from the customs also arrived to assist. Because the flames inside the cotton were extremely difficult to extinguish, the effort continued until 3:00 PM, when the entire cargo hold was filled with water, and the fire was completely extinguished. The water was then pumped out of the hold. It is estimated that over one thousand bales of cotton were burned, and another six to seven thousand bales were completely soaked in water, resulting in a loss of tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>American Automobile Company Car Jacked; Driver Forced Out in Zhabei; Vehicle Later Found on Zhifu Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at approximately 11:25 AM, two customers suddenly arrived at the American Automobile Company at 619 Ningbo Road and hired a car, stating that they wanted to go to the "Municipal Government" in the Chinese area. The driver, Yang Hongsheng (age 44, driver's license number 10848), drove a 17822 model car. After the two men got into the car,</p>
<p>it headed west.</p>
<p>After passing the Wuzhen Bridge on Xin Zha Road, one of the men suddenly ordered the driver to stop, saying that a woman was joining them. At that time, the other man got out of the car and then got back in the front of the car, sitting next to Yang and telling Hongsheng to drive wherever they told him and not to make any noise. Although the driver knew that something was wrong, he had no choice but to</p>
<p>do as he was told.</p>
<p>When the car drove to the vicinity of the Tianxia Huiguan on Song Park Road, three men in short clothes were standing by the roadside ahead. At that time, one of the bandits sitting next to Yang pulled out a pistol and threatened to drive, and ordered the driver to get out of the car. The three men in front also rushed over, jumped into the car, turned the car around, and sped south. One of the men with the gun, together with another man in short clothes, kept the driver, Yang Hongsheng, under surveillance near the Yizhongdi cemetery.</p>
<p>After an hour, he was freed and ordered to return. After Yang was released, he went through Yongxing Road and Mingde Road to the "Pseudo Police Station" to report the hijacking of the car. He then took a car from a fellow driver back to Shanghai and reported the hijacking to the Lao Zha Police Station. At about 3:00 PM, the car was found on the side of Zhifu Road at the Nicheng Bridge. The Lao Zha Police Station notified the car company to come and drive it back. As of 7:00 PM, no kidnapping cases had occurred in the two concessions.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Health Bureau Officials; Extorting Money by Inspecting Cleanliness; Chen Agou Awaits Court Hearing</h3>
<p>Chen Agou, a 26-year-old Suzhou native residing at 17 Ma'an Lane, 17 Maho Road, impersonated a Health Bureau official at 2:30 PM on the 12th of this month and went to the home of Wu Dekai, a Sichuan native residing at 8 Run Lane, Jutai Da Road, extorting money under the pretext of inspecting cleanliness. He was spotted by Health Officer Chen Derong, who immediately reported the incident to the No. 40 police station. The police station dispatched Detective Xu Jintang, who arrested Chen Agou. After investigation, it was learned that Chen had used the same method to extort one yuan at 11 Lane, 271 Xiafei Road, on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, and four yuan at 11 Lane, 263 Lafayette Road, on the 2nd of this month. The police station will transfer him to the court for prosecution yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news in the 14th of this month's newspaper about the tragic kidnapping and murder of children, which stated that "Yun Ji's young master Pan Xiangxi and Shen Tu's second child were designed by Yun Ji's Puren Zhong Bingchu, etc., and that the three were lured out of the school," and that "Zhong Jianchu confessed that the Zhiyi Primary School allowed Pan Xiangxi to leave and Wang's second child followed him out," these statements are inconsistent with the facts. Pan Xiangxi and other children were kidnapped by Yun Ji's shop assistant Zhong Bingchu and others on May 11th after school on their way home, and were not lured out of the school. Because Zhuang Genfa and Zhuang Shenfa, two students in the same grade as Pan Xiangxi and the other three children, saw Pan Xiangxi and the other children pass the school gate without entering and walking towards the direction of Da Zhong Lane. Therefore, we request that you investigate and publish this letter in your newspaper to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Zhiyi Primary School, June 15th.</p>

<h3>Admonishing Those Who Frequent Prostitutes</h3>
<p>The world of pleasure is alluring, and has thrived everywhere since ancient times. Shanghai is particularly rife with it these days, with fashionable attire and exquisite decorations, its momentum unstoppable. The establishments are known by grand names, and both staying in rooms and going out on calls are considered forms of business. Those outside the brothel are the most clear-headed, but upon entering the room, their minds are clouded. Foreign cigarettes and fruits are presented with utmost care. The wine is served, the worries are dispelled, and people are led into a bewitched state. Even more deceitful is the act of feigning great affection while seeing guests off at the top of the stairs. The courtesans are the most refined, residing in painted chambers, their beautiful faces adorned and their golden lotus feet small. They lightly strike the clappers, burn fragrant incense in ornate braziers, and play the pipa, evoking new emotions. It is truly blissful, passing night after night in a drunken stupor. The most expensive are the "Long Three" courtesans, who require familiar acquaintances to befriend them. There are only two or three of them in each establishment, dressed in Suzhou style, singing tunes from Beijing. At first, the feelings may seem faint, but to arrange a proper scene, they often use the "Thirteen Variations." The "Yao Er" courtesans are the most frivolous, calling for tea to be moved to the main hall. They don't discuss romantic trifles. A pipe of opium is packed, the business is completed, and the room is vacated. It's all too rushed, spending the night at the establishment after a brief visit during the day. The "Short Hanging" courtesans have small doorways, demanding a hundred cash coins for a quickie. Half a silver coin is concealed at the door. Rickshaw pullers and horse carriage drivers spend their days catering to their whims, never tiring of the task. It is truly pitiful to see them leaning against the door all day long with their children in tow. For the love of listening to Beijing opera, they invite their friends to the theater, putting on airs by ordering expensive tickets. You write a check, I write a check, as if money is no object. A moment of reflection reveals how many dollars have been spent.</p>

<h3>Gold Flat, Foreign Exchange Tightens After Initial Dip</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listed rate. The British and American exchange black markets suddenly tightened after initially easing. This was due to rumors circulating in the market, which slightly stimulated sentiment. Speculators tended to take a wait-and-see approach. In the early morning, Hong Kong telegrams were sold off forcefully, causing the US exchange rate to reach 6.15625 yuan and the British gold rate to reach 3 shillings 9.84375 pence around 10:30 AM. Afterwards, due to the influence of rumors, the market tightened. The US exchange rate once returned to 6 yuan, but the tightening was limited due to the strong supply of foreign exchange. The market then slightly returned to flat at the close. As a result, the British gold rate was the same as the previous day's close, at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence. The exchange rate was slightly tighter by 0.0625, at 6.03125 yuan. The trend of futures was similar to that of the spot market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Initially Experienced Selling Pressure</p>
<p>In the early morning, London bar prices rose by 0.0625 for both near and far terms. New York banks remained flat, London gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American currency remained unchanged. Against Shanghai, it was up 0.0625. Against France, there was no change. The US dollar fell by half a cent against the British pound and was flat against France. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 9.375 pence for British gold and 6.09375 yuan for the US dollar, which was up 0.003125 shillings for British gold and unchanged for the US dollar compared to the evening of the 7th. After the opening, Hong Kong investors initially came to sell, and the market appeared to ease. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegraphs sold US dollars for July delivery to outside companies at 5.9375 yuan, and British gold for June delivery at 3 shillings 9.53125 pence. The announced exchange rate did not change. The balance tax on silver was announced to increase by 0.50%. After that, outside companies were also full of supply intentions. Chinese speculators once saw opportunities to buy, and outside companies had US dollars for July delivery at 6 yuan, so the current US dollar had already reached 6.15625 yuan, and British gold had reached 3 shillings 9.84375 pence. Around 11:00 AM, there were more rumors in the market, and sentiment turned weak. Chinese speculators continued to buy in. The price then tightened. It is estimated that there were sales to Chinese speculators for US dollars for June delivery at 6.0625 yuan, and even 6 yuan. Later, outside companies sold US dollars for July delivery to Chinese speculators at 5.90625 yuan. However, the close was still stable. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence and the US dollar was 6.03125 yuan. This month's central gold was also 3 shillings 9.0625 pence and the US dollar was 6 yuan. Next month's British gold was 3 shillings 8.125 pence and the US dollar was 5.875 yuan. Compared to the close of the previous night, spot British was flat and the US dollar was tighter by 0.0625. This month's British was flat, and the US dollar was softer by 0.09375. July's British and American dollars each decreased by 0.03125 and 0.0625. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Rumors Spread, Gold Price Rebounded</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market was initially quiet, seemingly hovering. Later, rumors spread, the foreign exchange market tightened, stimulating buying, resulting in an increase of over 100 yuan. It opened at 5,380 yuan, with gold and silver shops forcefully selling short, pushing it down to 5,330 yuan. Later, with the support of the money exchange industry, it rose again to 5,370 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate was still loose, preventing further increases. Shortly after, it was pushed down by 20 yuan. At 11:00 AM, a certain rumor suddenly surfaced. Operators, with positive news, aggressively bought in, jumping to 5,510 yuan, and then closed. Compared to the favorable closing of the 10th, it was up 115 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The trading volume for half a day was about 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry in jewelry stores initially fell and then rose, ultimately returning 10 yuan. The customs gold, etc., were unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose by 100 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial foreign exchange eased, and sentiment weakened. However, a certain money exchange firm still showed some appetite, so the opening price was only pushed down by 15 yuan. The money exchange firm bought 20 taels from the silver shop for 5,380 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops and silver shop retailers sold off forcefully. Although another silver shop and a certain money exchange firm took the opportunity to buy in, they ultimately felt that the supply exceeded demand, and the price was further pushed down by a small 50 yuan. The silver shop sold 20 taels to the gold shop, reduced to 5,330 yuan. After that, the exchange market changed from loose to flat, and the money exchange firm and silver shop increased their purchases, while sellers gradually decreased. The price immediately recovered by 40 yuan. The gold shop sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 5,370 yuan. Subsequently, a certain Yu firm continued to sell off, and the price was lowered by another 20 yuan. The securities firm sold 10 taels to the gold shop for 5,350 yuan. Then, the silver shop helped to search again, and the securities firm also recently bought in. In addition, the foreign exchange market tightened, which caused retailers to rush in, immediately breaking through the 5,400 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the buying was even stronger at that time. It was because there were favorable rumors in the market, and the foreign exchange was particularly soft. Generally, those who sold short rushed to cover their positions. Before the close, it broke through the 5,500 yuan mark again. The silver shop bought a total of 50 taels from the money exchange firm and retailers for 5,510 yuan as the closing price. As a result, it rose by 115 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. The price was particularly firm after the close, with no sellers at 5,520 yuan. The fluctuations in half a day were 180 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold brand of the cash gold shop was 10 yuan higher than the spot red price. The closing price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Very little trading was opened.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Was Also Listed at 10 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael was still suspended at 960 yuan in Datongxing. At 9:30, it was listed at 10 yuan lower. At 11:15, it rose by 10 yuan. At noon, it was listed at 10 yuan higher. After that, there were no changes. As a result, it was still 10 yuan higher. It is estimated that Datongxing changed the suspension price to 570 yuan. The new business was the same as the previous price. The closing price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Initially Fell and Then Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, spot red suddenly rose near noon. The supply and demand of British and American gold pounds were initially balanced. Near noon, the demand suddenly increased, and the market price rose. The supply and demand of British gold notes were balanced, and the market price was stable. The Parisian gold notes initially experienced a surge in selling due to the fall of Paris, once falling to 16.07 yuan. Later, as the black market foreign exchange softened and the public's demand suddenly increased, it rose to 16.5 jiao in the afternoon. It was initially brisk in the afternoon, but ultimately returned to flat. As a result, it rose by 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was slightly weaker, and the market price continued to rise by 3 fen. Canadian and Philippine notes were in demand, and the market price uniformly rose by 1 jiao. Japanese and Korean gold notes were also in demand, with the former at 1.09 yuan and the latter at 0.935 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Sales to Hong Kong Unrelenting</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and gradually entering a period of consolidation. However, in South China, the demand for fine and coarse yarn continues unabated. Therefore, although Paris has fallen, sentiment has not been greatly affected. At the same time, American cotton has risen, and the situation is particularly stable. The value of a certain yarn is still cheap.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, and the atmosphere was still mild due to the continued rise in foreign cotton and the slight easing of foreign exchange. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,250 yuan, immediately rising to 1,130 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the gold price was flat, and more selling emerged, and the table saw a slight loosening, falling to 1,110 yuan. By the closing time, the short sellers covered their positions, and sentiment recovered. The market then rose again to 1,123 yuan. The transaction volume for half a day was 1,450 bales. The 20-count horse fell by 9 yuan. A total of 1,110 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each trade is listed below: Same trade 1,100 Hong Kong 330 Ningbo 20 Total 1,450.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Still Watching and Waiting</h3>
<p>Transactions for local cotton are often dull. However, Indian cotton mills have some demand, and the selling price is particularly cheap. Transactions with the same trade are even clearer. Everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the market is still in a stagnant state. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Ping Guoer 10.0 Yong'an imported 200 pieces for delivery to the factory Brazilian cotton 250.0 Xinyi imported 20 pieces and</p>
<p>Another news on foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market fell at the beginning of the morning due to the pressure from the sellers. Afterwards, the market rebounded due to the purchase of the public and the partial cover of the shorts. As a result, the closing price rose by 18-9 points compared to the previous day. India, including forecast, rose by 2 rupees.</p>
<p>The price of foreign cotton in Shanghai has stabilized, but the transaction is extremely quiet. There are many optimists in all parties because of the step-by-step rise of American cotton. However, they are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. The general opinion is that the current price has reached the lowest price, so the selling price will not fall again.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Yarn Craze: High Prices, Steep Falls, All for a Game – Japanese Yarn, Domestic Yarn, Shared Fate</h3>
<p>The changes in the yarn market over the past six months have been truly astonishing. In reality, it was a group of speculators concentrated on an isolated island, using abundant floating capital to engage in large-scale speculation, creating enormous waves and a boom-and-bust scenario. In early spring of this year, due to the continuous contraction of exchange rates and the daily rise of gold prices, cotton yarn followed suit and advanced. At this time, precisely during the peak sales season of spring, speculators' thoughts became more intense. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose directly from 800 yuan to over 1,100 or 1,200 yuan. Short sellers, seeing the continuous demand from Hong Kong, appeared quite fearful. Several firms had already collapsed. The short side posted notices in the market, claiming that the futures trading in the market was illegal. For a time, both the long and short sides settled their positions and temporarily concluded. At this time, the price of Japanese Moon Harp yarn "above" was only around 900 yuan, with a difference of over 200 yuan from the price of Variable Horse yarn "below." Moreover, since the Double Horse brand had a crisis and some suffered the hardship of being unable to recover their money (Note: Japanese yarn was traded upstairs, while Chinese-English factory yarn was traded downstairs, hence the terms "above" and "below"), a group of speculators rushed to the Japanese yarn market to play the speculative game. Furthermore, Japanese yarn speculation involved in-and-out trading, with neither side needing to deposit collateral. As a result, the momentum became even more intense. Within two days, the price surged to 1,300 or 1,400 yuan. The Double Horse yarn "below" also followed and rose to over 1,500 yuan. By the May settlement, several Double Horse firms had already collapsed. The Japanese yarn settlement "above" still had no problems. Therefore, everyone went "above" to speculate. Trading unexpectedly developed and stabilized. In April, the factories had issued a large amount of cheap yarn, and there were also many arbitrageurs. After the market price soared, most firms profited, and the buying frenzy became more acute. Small-capital arbitrageurs had even more intense thoughts, as they could obtain a profit of 80 to 90 percent or even more than 100 percent. Once May passed, the severity of the rising trend made people fearful. Prices soared daily, jumping to 1,825 yuan. Unexpectedly, things went against the norm, and extreme prosperity was bound to decline. The European war expanded daily, and Indian, American cotton markets, and stocks all suffered disastrous losses. As a result, speculators were dealt a heavy blow. Although there was no extreme impact on Shanghai, the speculators suffered losses overseas and had to convert their stockpiled goods into cash for compensation. Foreign exchange was also in the same sick state. Once the exchange rate eased, the local market plummeted. Japanese yarn fell directly from 1,820 yuan to the recent 780 yuan. In less than a month, the difference was 1,040 yuan. Under such circumstances, how could the long side support it? Naturally, some collapsed, some fled. The prosperity of clearinghouses rose like bamboo shoots after rain. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose to 1,825 yuan, and the lowest price fell to 990 yuan, also a drop of 835 yuan. It is said that while there was certainly not a small amount of money to be made, the losses of arbitrageurs were also extremely significant. Although speculators made careful plans, the result was creating opportunities for others, which was a small gain at a great loss. (Shan)</p>
<h3>Securities: Category A Alone Rises Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market was the opposite of the previous day's situation. Category A alone rose, while the rest were all small declines. From the market price being sticky and repeatedly fluctuating, one could discern the apathy and unease in people's hearts. There were more transactions in the morning than in the afternoon. Jiu Feng and Hong Da slightly increased their positions. Sheng Da, Tian Feng, and Tong Kang slightly bought in. Hong Kang and Chang Ji sold a lot of Category C. Tong Ji sold more Category B. In the afternoon, only Four Star slightly bought in. Scattered retail investors slightly sold. There were very few transactions. The total trading volume for the day was about 500,000 yuan, with 400,000 yuan in the morning. As a result, only Category A rose slightly by five cents, while the rest fell by one or two dimes. The concise table is shown below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Chinese Merchant Cement stock were traded at a price of 50 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Friday) telegram: Today's market quotation for Chinese foreign debts and British Far East company stocks is generally flat. There were no gains or losses for bonds at any level.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White First Weak, Then Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was first weak, then stable. As a result, there was not much movement. The guild's price was 69.5 yuan for current spot No. 2 Coarse White from the local warehouse. In the afternoon, it was 70.03 yuan. The initial market price for sugar from outside warehouses fell by one yuan to 69 yuan, then to 69.4 yuan. In the afternoon, it still reached 70 yuan. Transshipment goods were 54.8 yuan to 55.2 yuan in the morning and 55.5 yuan to 55.7 yuan in the afternoon, up two dimes. New goods of Taikoo Granulated White B mark were 82.5 yuan, old goods were 82 yuan, Dutch Red was 60 yuan, local factory Snow White was 70.5 yuan, down five cents. Local Ice Candy of the same grade No. 1 was 91.5 yuan, Crystal Bright Ice was 93 yuan. Guo Tang opened a few hundred bags of Taikoo Lun arrived goods at 63.5 yuan. Guang Bang opened dozens of barrels of sliced green at 52 yuan.</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Bad Debts</h3>
<p>– Zheng Zhi</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, most of the businesses in this city aimed to collect debts before the Mid-Autumn Festival and the New Year's Festival. Therefore, bad debts were bound to occur before these holidays, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. The ones involving a few thousand yuan were even more numerous.</p>
<p>For example, the bad debt of the Nan Shi XXX Sanlian Company before the war amounted to more than 700,000 yuan, and the result was only settled at a 20-30% rate. Both the debtor and the creditor often based their actions on emotions and did not declare bankruptcy through proper legal procedures. If the amount owed was relatively large, they would first negotiate in advance to increase the discount rate. When it came to settling the accounts, if the debtor only offered a 10% settlement, they would then negotiate to increase it to 15%, and the result would be a 20-30% settlement. The creditors who were owed the most would immediately agree, and then the rest would be easily resolved. This was the easiest way to settle accounts, which led to a vicious cycle where bad debts occurred every year and were considered commonplace. No one ever thoroughly corrected this, which was indeed strange.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for these bad debts? They mainly fall into the following two categories: (1) Business failure makes it impossible to maintain operations, so they have no choice but to declare bankruptcy. After bankruptcy, they can preserve a portion of their assets for a comeback later. (2) Business speculation failure is also resolved through bankruptcy. The result is similar to the above. Very few businessmen who fail can publicly return all the assets to the creditors. The worst cases involve "opening a night tide," fleeing to another city overnight to avoid responsibility. Although warnings or arrest warrants are issued afterward, it is often of no use.</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, currency values fluctuated greatly, and credit became tight. As a result, all businesses had to shorten their credit periods or switch to cash transactions. Although business volume decreased slightly, the occurrence of bad debts became extremely rare, which was a gratifying development. From this, we can see that mutual reliance on real strength can reduce the risk of bad debts. Conversely, if credit accounts are extended, bad debts will inevitably continue to arise.</p>
<p>However, last year, another group of XX companies went bankrupt, repeating the same old tricks, with a total amount of more than 10,000 yuan. The reason was still the yarn business, and the root cause was still based on emotional considerations. In addition to short-term credit and cash transactions, various companies gave XX a larger discount and a longer credit period. Once there was a financial crisis, they immediately repeated the old bankruptcy routine, even fleeing overnight because they felt the discount rate was too low before settling the accounts. This was truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Now that the Dragon Boat Festival has just passed, I will briefly describe some past events above as a warning to all businesses. The original intention of the reporter is to point out a gain in business during the extraordinary period, that is, to shorten the credit period and engage in cash transactions to reduce the risk of bad debts, not to criticize the shortcomings of both parties. Therefore, I have only vaguely shown a small glimpse of past events as an example. I hope that all businesses will repeatedly consider this matter.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Surge by Over Two Yuan; Using "Control" as a Background to Stage a Duet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market in the central city had a strong change. The prices of all goods rose across the board. Initially, it was attributed to the cloudy and rainy weather, making people hesitant. However, the buying interest suddenly surged. Not only was the demand from inland villages and towns doubly active, but also the transshipment goods of the North and South Ocean gangs were squeezed. Suddenly, amid the scramble, speculators became even more active. In the blink of an eye, the prices of all kinds of foreign rice soared by one to three yuan. No. 1 Saigon and Annam Japonica rice were even bid up to 60 yuan. At this price, it was close to the sharp prices in the producing areas. The original commission agents ordered a large batch of No. 2 Saigon and mixed broken rice, no less than 2,000 tons, from foreign firms. The news spread, and people's enthusiasm was slightly dampened. The sales market weakened, and the opening prices also declined. At the close, No. 1 Old Saigon and No. 1 Siam rice were both 58.5 yuan, fire-dried rice was 97.8 yuan, small-pattern rice was 55.3 yuan, Tokyo pointed rice was 55 yuan, rice tea was 53 yuan, mixed broken rice was 51.75 yuan and 50.05 yuan, still a surge of about two yuan compared to the previous market. However, in the afternoon, it was raised again by various parties competing to buy, and the result was still over two yuan higher than the previous night. Small-pattern rice opened at 54.2 yuan in the morning and rose all the way to 56 yuan at the close. No. 1 Saigon rice closed at 58.7 yuan, and No. 1 and No. 2 Siam rice both reached 57 yuan. The return price of No. 2 Siam rice also went from 61.5 yuan to 62 yuan. No. 1 Saigon Hong Kong goods also reached 57.5 yuan. However, 2,800 tons of the newly ordered Saigon No. 1 and 2 mixed broken rice were agreed upon, sold by Ren Ji to rice merchants. There were still 3,000 tons that had not been agreed upon. 2,000 tons of No. 2 Siam at 60.05 yuan still need to be replied to. The total turnover of returned rice was over 200 tons, and there were over 10,000 bags of current rice.</p>
<p>Regarding thick and thin Japonica and other domestic rice, it was rumored that in the off-market black market, most cargo owners believed that the old goods in the inland areas were about to be sold out, the source was dwindling, and transportation to the inland areas was hindered. It was rumored that a certain party had banned the export of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, and refused to transport daily necessities inland. With a lack of transportation profits, they regarded the goods in hand as scarce goods, and the price continued to soar by two yuan. Chang Bang special clear Japonica rice opened at 66 yuan, and Su Kun Changzhou white Japonica rice also needed 64 or 65 yuan. Qing Si thin rice was 65 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice was 62.5 yuan, then 61.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market followed suit and became unusually enthusiastic. Not only was retail demand quite strong, but also large-scale stockpiling continued to be active. In addition, the price was low, making it most suitable for inland villages and towns, and they made large purchases, causing sellers to shout prices randomly without standards. As a result, Jin Yuan special yuan opened at 52 yuan, Chang Dan white yuan was around 50 yuan, and Jiangbei goods were sold at 48 yuan, two yuan higher than Japonica rice.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Clearly Stable, Implicitly Firm; Hua Flour Mills Have Reduced Work News</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market presented a clearly stable, implicitly firm picture. The sales market on this street was quite active. The price of 13.8 yuan for No. 2 flour from the flour mills was considered cheap. However, the various mills were not able to continuously supply new wheat at the moment, and for those who did not increase the wholesale price on this street, it was a maintenance measure. Therefore, they were unwilling to sacrifice large quantities, even if the customer sold it to 16.25 yuan, it was also an invisible restriction. The total turnover of flour was estimated to be about 7,000 or 8,000 bags. The asking price for inland flour and returned flour was 14.45 yuan, but there was no actual transaction heard.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the various Chinese merchant flour mills in Shanghai, due to the obstructed source of new wheat and the raw materials of old wheat only being sufficient for half a month, while the flour price was difficult to increase, had temporarily suspended some of the mechanical production to reduce work. Once the new wheat poured in, they would resume production.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Broad Beans Actively Sold; Soybean Inventory Scarce, Continuing to Tighten by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>New broad beans, due to the small source and the purchase from Shantou, Xiamen, Ningbo, Hong Kong, etc., resulted in more demand than supply, and the rising trend gradually intensified. According to statistics, over 600 bags of Jiading white broad beans were sold, with prices ranging from 19.01 yuan to 19.7 yuan. Over 400 bags of Beigang green broad beans were sold, with prices ranging from 20.05 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybeans, due to the resurgence of soybean cake (over 20,000 pieces of spot and futures cake were traded, with 5,000 pieces properly purchased by the Shantou gang and the rest stockpiled by the trading houses), the oil mills were eager to buy, and exports were also active on this street. Therefore, under the situation of scarce arrivals and inventories, prices continued to tighten by half a yuan, but there were not many transactions. Because the inventory held by the cargo owners was less than 10,000 bags, they simply tightened the price. Only over 250 bags of Anqing beans, two carts of Bengbu beans, Wu Hu beans, 100 bags of Ping Hu beans, 150 bags of Taicang beans, over 100 bags of Pu beans, and over 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded.</p>
<p>Also, 2,320 bags of soybeans and 250 bags of raw oil, 300 cans of raw oil, are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Early Red Shrimp Tails Sold</h3>
<p>Recently, dozens of boxes of Jiangbei Star Red Shrimp Tails arrived, but due to the sluggish demand, there were no buyers. It was heard that they were already sold at a price of 160 yuan yesterday. The goods were very dry and could be stored for a long time, but the market trend was soft, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Siam Sparingly Market Exists</h3>
<p>Siam sparingly source of supply is seamless, and the market exists abundantly, but turnover is flat. The previous market has fallen to one hundred and sixty-five yuan, but the present market only sells for one hundred and fifty yuan. According to general observations, the later market is still expected to continue to decline.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Both Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise; Silk Transactions in this City are Very Clear; Zhejiang Cocoons Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>Recently, in the silk market, foreign silk prices, both Japanese and American, have seen high prices. As of the beginning of the week, Yokohama spot prices rose 70 yuan, and forward prices rose 84 yuan. New York near-term prices rose 14 cents, and forward prices rose 13 cents. However, the reason for this was not a turnaround in actual sales, but the stimulus of the worsening situation of the European war and the potential participation of the United States in the war.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, foreign firms have stopped buying, foreign exchange is easing, and the market prices of inland silk orchid are still difficult to decline. Therefore, the difference between domestic and foreign silk prices is 300 or 400 yuan. Therefore, in recent days, transactions have been clear and prices have been weak.</p>
<p>Zhejiang East cocoons continue to be transported. Yesterday, another 158 packages arrived in Shanghai, transported by the Lai He Foreign Company's Haifu Wheel from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Also, 280 pieces of tea arrived from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>North-South Specialties: Black Dates Planned to be Sold for Cash</h3>
<p>Black dates have been negotiating for many days without a transaction because customers need to change to cash sales. It was heard yesterday that dozens of packages had been opened, and the price of High Jinan Unified Hand Dates was 26 yuan in cash, but the firms had not reached an agreement. For example, Yu Cai had opened for cash, and there were also openings for remittances. It is still in the process of negotiating for all to be sold for cash.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fat Bie Takes Large Sales</h3>
<p>Fat Bie has been quite firm recently, and the market is unusually outstanding. The current wholesale price of British-made No. 1 is 28 yuan per yard, ordinary goods are 23-24 yuan, and lower-grade goods are 17-18 yuan. Yesterday, the number one eastern goods were sold at 24-25 yuan, ordinary goods were sold at around 20 yuan, and lower-grade goods were 14-15 yuan. There are no surpluses among those with existing stocks, and their sales are extremely smooth. The small western clothing tailoring shops in this city continue to have a need. The newer patterns and slightly superior colors are all being sold out. The samples issued by the demolition gang have all been cut off corners and sold out.</p>
<p>Also, 215 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today, and another 30 pieces were shipped to. The incoming goods included 17 boxes of wool yarn, which were shipped from Tianjin on the 15th.</p>

<h3>The Picture on the Right is a Distant View of the Seine River in Paris</h3>
<h3>Where is Europe Going?</h3>
<p>Prosperous Paris has fallen. The second phase of the Great War on the Western Front has come to an end. In just ten days, the French capital has fallen to the German army. This is the second time in seventy years. Europe! Europe! Where is your destination!</p>
<p>Tracing back from 800 BC to 1900 AD, the civilization of the European continent has always been the most enlightened. Even the development of modern science, industry, and technology originated there. Now, in the 20th century, the European continent has become a place of constant conflict and the most unstable corner of the world. This is truly strange. Africa is lagging behind in everything, and has not caused such frequent disturbances. Asia has always been peaceful until the white race brought their restless thoughts and forces to the banks of the Yuan River and the Yangtze River, and the situation changed. The rest of the world now has a feeling that if they never interact with Europe, they can achieve a paradise of singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Since Europe can create a great civilization, why can't it allow it to develop normally?</p>
<p>Europe was initially a product of agriculture. Agriculture in the United States is another kind of industry, that is, thoroughly opening up the land. In Europe, agriculture means surviving on the land. Their nature is very different.</p>
<p>From the beginning of colonization, the United States allowed small landowners to cultivate the land and then move elsewhere. In the Old World of Europe, however, agriculture has always been limited to a fixed location. Many farmers have inherited the same land for generations, for as long as 1,000 to 1,200 years, such as in the central provinces of France, Brittany and Normandy in the northwest, Scotland, northern Spain, southwestern Germany, and northwestern and central Italy.</p>
<p>In short, most European farmers have lived in their current locations since the 6th to 12th centuries, creating five or six hundred tiny territories. Year after year, from the close adaptation of the land, climate, and background, the various customs, habits, arts, literature, architecture, politics, and social systems of Europe have emerged.</p>
<p>In ancient times, nations had already emerged in Western Europe. By 1400, England and France had their national consciousness. Political leaders adapted to the times and were able to establish larger systems on the agricultural territories, transforming them into powerful nations, and civilization was complete.</p>
<p>However, Central Europe failed to achieve this. The leaders of Western and Southern Europe attempted to establish a nation or federation on the vast plains of the Danube, but they also failed. The Romans once used force to create a prototype of economic cooperation, but it soon disintegrated. Although the Roman military organization was very strong, the Roman Empire had no borders, and barbaric tribes harassed it endlessly, making it impossible to maintain it.</p>
<p>At that point, civilization was swept away. After the 5th century, the Church began to rebuild Central Europe based on religious unity, with the Pope as the arbitrator of various disputes and the king as the executor. This may have been the best solution at the time. Later, some Christians denied the Pope's supreme spiritual authority, and this system broke down.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Europeans returned to the plans of the ancient Romans. King Louis XIV of France and Napoleon both planned to promote commerce with good governance and enforce peace with an iron fist, thereby organizing Europe to benefit France. They won many battles and annexed a great deal of land, but they all failed to achieve their goals. The Central European nations had different religions and interests, and the organization was inherently fragile. Once they encountered pressure from England and Russia, they collapsed.</p>
<p>The Hohenzollern dynasty then followed the old tricks of the Romans and Napoleon, organizing Central Europe to benefit Germany. However, the Great War of 1914 to 1918 also made this attempt a bubble. Once the Western European countries won, they applied their prejudices to Central Europe and divided it into several countries, giving them common religious ideals and democratic beliefs. The League of Nations was established, and it attempted to complete what the Pope had not been able to achieve. Unfortunately, the League of Nations was weak and incompetent, and it was at a loss for Central Europe, causing the Central European countries to gradually starve. The founders of the League of Nations seemed to disregard economic issues, allowing Austria to have no agriculture and Hungary to have no industry.</p>
<p>For this reason, the angry waves of the Danube are surging. If a revolution does not break out, war will occur. From 1918 to 1938, the proposal to organize the Danube Federation and provide economic cooperation and political understanding to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Poland was constantly heard. However, the above-mentioned countries were each governed by their own policies and plundered at will, with no cooperation to speak of. Although they did not refuse loans from the League of Nations and the League of Nations' well-meaning advice, they stopped at that. Hitler rose from the chaotic Central Europe.</p>
<p>Hitler aimed to establish a completely new Central Europe and transfer the transportation of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic to seize the interests of the Southern European countries. To achieve this goal, Germany has built a network of canals on the upper Danube and lower Rhine, which can be used by ocean-going ships, and at the same time built highways connecting Hungary and Romania to open up new trade routes. Germany's plan is likely to cause the Mediterranean to lose its international importance, which England and France cannot tolerate.</p>
<p>Hitler's alliance with the Soviet Union, from a political and ideological point of view, was indeed surprising, but it was also the inevitable result of his desire for Eastern Europe. However, even if Hitler created a new trade route connecting Germany, making Berlin the hub of all goods in Central Europe, and even tried to adjust the Soviet economy to adapt to the German system, the political problems in Central Europe have not been resolved, which will endanger Germany's entire plan.</p>
<p>In summary, the problem of Central Europe is deep-rooted and difficult to solve. Many Germans are also farmers, and they have a vague sense of where their country's rapid expansion will end. In general, when a European nation has a vague idea of its homeland, its spirit becomes weak. This is the reason for Napoleon's defeat in 1913 to 1915. It is too early to say whether today's Hitler can avoid this mistake.</p>
<h3>Several Major Battles in European History: Britain Secures Naval Supremacy, Germany Holds Land Army Advantage</h3>
<p>Britain has the strongest navy in the world. Germany is the best when it comes to land armies. This is a fact known to everyone, young and old, at home and abroad. Britain has maintained control of the ocean for 352 years, during which it has undergone five glorious sea battles:</p>
<p>(1) In 1588, the Spanish fleet sent by Philip II to conquer England was defeated in the English Channel.</p>
<p>(2) In 1692, the fleet of King Louis XIV of France was defeated at La Hogue in northern France.</p>
<p>(3) In 1805, Nelson crushed Napoleon's dream of coveting sea power at Trafalgar in the southwestern sea of Spain.</p>
<p>(4) In 1916, the fleet of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany was defeated at Jutland in Denmark.</p>
<p>(5) In 1940, Hitler's fleet was defeated off the coast of Norway.</p>
<p>The German army has been rampant on the European continent for almost 199 years, during which it has undergone six major battles with alternating victories and defeats:</p>
<p>(1) In 1741, Frederick the Great won a great victory in the Seven Years' War, and the Prussian army began to show its strength.</p>
<p>(2) In 1806, it was defeated by Napoleon at Jena. After that, Prussia adopted a system of universal conscription.</p>
<p>(3) In 1866, Bismarck defeated the Austrian army at Sadowa, and Prussia gradually gained leadership in unifying Germany.</p>
<p>(4) In 1871, Moltke the Elder defeated the French army in the Franco-Prussian War. Paris was besieged for nineteen weeks and finally fell.</p>
<p>(5) In 1919, Ludendorff's final general offensive was repulsed by the Allied forces of Britain, France, and the United States. After the Treaty of Versailles, Seeckt built a new army.</p>
<p>(6) In 1940, Hitler defeated the British and French Allied forces on the Western Front and invaded Paris.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aversion to War</h3>
<p>Japanese aversion to war is becoming increasingly apparent. The scarcity of daily necessities is particularly making life difficult for the people. Newspaper reports of "public unrest" are common. The following are excerpts from various newspapers to give a glimpse of the situation:</p>
<p>Nichi Nichi Shimbun: If the government authorities would only allow the public to know the true state of the nation's finances, the public would not be as anxious as it is today.</p>
<p>Yomiuri Shimbun: Nationwide unrest is always a precursor to the collapse of the cabinet, which is caused by public doubts about the government's policies.</p>
<p>Mainichi Shimbun: When daily necessities are lacking in a country at war, the first thing to do is to find a way to dispel public fears.</p>
<p>Yomiuri Shimbun: Recently, the government's actions have always been kept secret, and the people have taken to looking after their own livelihoods. The government will not be able to obtain national cooperation.</p>
<p>Nichi Nichi Shimbun: There are many reasons for the lack of public spirit, and the government's lack of sincerity is one of them.</p>
<p>Mainichi Shimbun: Since there are many reasons for the public's spiritual disarray, the remedies are becoming complex.</p>
<p>Such comments, made a year and a half ago, would almost have been regarded as treasonous, but now they are seen almost daily. Although the general public acknowledges that the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia" must be carried out, they are also increasingly concerned about protecting the domestic economy. One author even published blunt words in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, saying that no matter how concentrated a country is on fighting, there is a limit. If this limit is ignored, it will endanger the national economic life.</p>
<p>In addition, there are occasional reports in newspapers hinting that the military's policies are no longer entirely appropriate. However, due to the strict surveillance of the military police, no one dares to openly condemn the army. (Translated from the Christian Science Monitor)</p>
<h3>The Poverty of North China</h3>
<p>— By Birmingham</p>
<p>"The majority of Chinese residents in North China are about to fall into abject poverty. The natural resilience and restorative power of the Chinese people in coping with the dangers of survival are often praised by the world. They are superior in overcoming all kinds of natural and man-made disasters, and can quickly restore economic life to its original state. However, in North China today, especially in the vast rural areas, the survival of the residents is fundamentally shaken."</p>
<p>This is a section from the annual report of the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce, which shows the anxiety of people about the current economic situation in North China. The famine situation in the inland flood-stricken areas seems to have no solution. Direct relief cannot be carried out. The Japanese are insistent on controlling the distribution of food, which has effectively blockaded the inland areas, preventing relief organizations from transporting food to the disaster areas. However, the situation in major cities such as Peiping and Tianjin has improved slightly recently.</p>
<p>Hebei Province usually produces seven million tons of grain annually. Although the various food imports to Tianjin are not small, they do not exceed 240,000 tons, less than one-twentieth of the local production. This shows the dire situation in the disaster areas. No one knows how the disaster victims are eking out a living. In the past twenty years, disasters have occurred one after another, culminating in this flood. It began with severe drought and famine, followed by internal wars, then the Sino-Japanese War, continuous guerrilla warfare, and the Japanese invasion, followed by floods. Nowhere in the world has suffered as much as Hebei Province in the past ten years.</p>
<p>The economic status of North China is very similar to that of the Northeast during the Zhang Zuolin era. Of course, the "special status" of North China is purely artificial, and it lacks the geographical, historical, and natural conditions for a special status in economic terms. This special status is entirely created for a political purpose. However, if the serious economic shortcomings of North China are not remedied, their impact may make this political purpose impossible to achieve. North China was originally unable to operate as an economic unit within its own boundaries, but what is currently being attempted is precisely this self-contained activity.</p>
<p>In the disintegration of the warlord era, there were still many unbreakable connections that maintained the overall necessary economic unity and reduced the harm of division. For example, regardless of political and local changes, the economic system always maintained its integrity. This is still a major factor in the guerrilla areas within the occupied territories.</p>
<p>There is constant talk of organizing economic blocs. But the reality in North China is moving in the opposite direction. Prices are soaring in various parts of the Far East, but prices in North China are rising extraordinarily, which is only a sign of an extremely bad economic situation. Furthermore, the sharp drop in exports and the unprecedented increase in imports are also an unfavorable sign.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Outer Mongolia was carved out of North China's economic sphere by the Soviet Union, and its trade no longer passed through Tianjin. Now Inner Mongolia is following suit by establishing an "independent" economic system. In some respects, North China and Inner Mongolia have changed from a situation of mutual supplementation to a state of hostility, which is particularly evident in the struggle for foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In the past, North China imported food and other goods from the Northeast, Central China, South China, and other countries. Now, "Manchukuo" respects its own interests, and its trade relations with North China in the past have been severed, cutting off the natural economic links between the two regions. From an economic point of view, because North China circulates special currency, Central China and South China have almost become "foreign countries." The relationship that still exists can only exist through the use of legal tender as a medium. North China's usual exports have mostly been diverted to other ports. The most serious problem is that the places of production and distribution of goods have been separated, and the total amount is unknown. External criticism is directed at the issuance of banknotes by the United Reserve Bank. Although the area where the United Reserve banknotes circulate is limited to cities and transportation lines, this accounts for only a small part of the vast area with one hundred million residents.</p>
<p>The numerous banknotes circulating in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, "Manchukuo," and the Japanese-occupied areas are almost entirely stacked on the weak foundation of Japanese gold reserves, while the public seems to think that the amount of United Reserve currency issued by the central and communist parties in the Chinese mainland is more than double the highest circulating amount of Chinese currency in all of North China before 1937.</p>
<p>The second annual report of the United Reserve Bank stated that during the Lunar New Year, the total amount of banknotes issued totaled 510 million yuan, almost double the previous year, and an increase of 200 million yuan compared to the first half of the year. Although it is said that the purpose is to prevent inflation and withdraw excess banknotes due to rising prices, only 10 million yuan has been withdrawn since the Lunar New Year, while the amount increased in January and February of this year reached 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Last year's trade showed a decrease of 45 percent in exports compared to 1938, from 177.6 million yuan to 95.5 million yuan. While exports decreased by nearly half, imports increased by about 40 percent. Their value is about three or four times that of exports. This situation is the same as in 1938, that is, the most increased is the grain and flour needed for people's livelihood. In Tianjin alone, the increase was 30 percent.</p>
<p>Although there are many reasons for this increase in imports, the frequent decline in the value of the United Reserve currency and the drop in the exchange rate to an unprecedented low are also a sufficient reason for some capital flight. The sharp decline in domestic productivity is also a reason.</p>
<p>In the first few months of this year, the import of foreign goods has already shown a significant decline, and it is likely to continue to decline.</p>
<p>In addition to this, North China is currently forced to remit unprecedented amounts of money to import essential food from foreign countries. The production of domestic food and crops is insufficient, and what is produced is often requisitioned by the warring parties or forcibly purchased at prices far below market prices. Farmers, seeing that the results of their labor cannot get a fair price, are unwilling to work hard to cultivate rice, wheat, cotton, and hemp, except for what they need themselves. The raising of cattle, sheep, mules, and horses is also of no interest due to lack of encouragement. Exports of cotton, wool, ramie, and cattle and sheep leather have been banned and have almost completely stopped.</p>
<p>The exchange rate has fallen sharply, and there is no foreign currency to be obtained without exporting goods. The people are poor and unable to purchase necessary food from foreign countries. The value of the local currency is only falling, but the standard of living is increasing rapidly. A [gap] has opened in the economic balance, and it is difficult to close.</p>
<p>The value of a special status as a political and strategic tool depends on economic strength. Political means are only a framework, and it is the economic system that gives it flesh and blood and vitality. Given the poverty of the economic situation, the so-called special status is like a dream.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in North China Has Become an Arrow at the End of Its Flight</h3>
<p>Chinese guerrillas have returned to the Jizhong Plain. The Japanese army is entrenched in larger cities, facing a precarious situation. Although their supplies are delivered by motorized convoys escorted by soldiers, they are intermittent and irregular, and travel is difficult. In the countryside, Chinese troops move freely. The Japanese army in Shanxi Province still claims to be confined to the narrow plains in the central part and the railway lines. At the beginning of this year, the Japanese army in Shanxi spent a large amount of manpower and resources to carry out "mopping-up" operations, but gained no land. Recently, there have been fierce battles in Dongping south of Kaifeng, Zhangde in northern Henan, and the mountains northwest of the Pinghan Railway, but the Japanese army has gained nothing. The Japanese side feels that the use of troops is obviously inadequate, and their quality is also inferior to that of the Japanese army that initially invaded. The die-hard elements of the Japanese army still say that they must use "blitzkrieg" to seek a quick decision, but the Japanese army has been fighting for three years and its resources are exhausted. How can it launch a "blitzkrieg"? If it only uses its current strength to attack again, at best it will be like summer lightning, a fleeting flash. In North China alone, the Japanese side must at least increase its elite troops by 500,000, supplemented by mechanized equipment and aircraft, to be able to achieve its goals.

<h3>Supplement to "Guidance on Further Education"</h3>
<p>— By Fang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhongyi's two articles on "Guidance on Further Education," I felt that there were still a few points that Mr. Zhongyi had not mentioned. Now let me add to them below:</p>
<p>First, regarding the preparations for further education, I believe that if one is reasonably confident in the three subjects of composition, general knowledge, and arithmetic, one should also prepare in advance for the English language course. The most common thing is that some simple vocabulary and basic grammar should be thoroughly understood. Because now most middle schools in Shanghai probably have English as a subject in their entrance exams, and its importance is no less than that of arithmetic, etc.</p>
<p>Second, middle schools can be roughly divided into three categories: general middle schools, vocational middle schools, and normal schools. If you plan to work in the field of education in the future, then you should now enter a normal school. Vocational middle schools can be divided into engineering, business, science, etc. These are all designed to prepare you for application in society after graduation. General middle schools are designed to prepare you for further education. Therefore, when you choose a school, of course, you should choose a good school as your goal. But on the other hand, you must also match your future aspirations. This is also something that children who are going to further education cannot ignore. Otherwise, if what you learn is not what you use, the future may be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Third, when taking entrance exams, you need to complete all the steps of the exam procedures clearly in advance. After you have chosen the school you want to take the exam for, first get a copy of the school's regulations, and then register and take the exam according to the procedures listed in the regulations. Children themselves are also very clear about these things, but sometimes they may be negligent, so that they may miss the registration date, etc. Therefore, I will mention it again.</p>
<p>Children who are going to further education, being able to go to further education is definitely not something to be proud of. How should you use your superior environment to strive for progress! "Learning knows no bounds," and there is no end to the pursuit of knowledge!</p>
<h3>Li Xun Who Planted Apple Trees</h3>
<p>— By Wang Yijue</p>
<p>Children, below is a very interesting story. The main character in this story, Li Xun, was able to sacrifice his personal future to work hard on something that no one noticed, without monetary rewards, but that was in fact extremely beneficial to mankind. He succeeded, he saved his compatriots, he saved the region.</p>
<p>In the campus of a certain university, student Li Xun and several classmates were discussing their aspirations for their future after graduation. Some wanted to be military strategists, some wanted to be politicians, but only Li Xun wanted to go to the Northwest to plant apple trees, because disasters often occurred in the Northwest, and he knew that if a large number of trees grew, disasters would be reduced. When he talked about his aspirations, his classmates laughed out loud, all thinking that doing this was too worthless. But although Li Xun was ridiculed by his classmates, his will was still very firm, and he prepared to set off after graduation.</p>
<p>He had a little money. He took an assistant to Gansu Province and other places, each carrying a load full of apple seeds. When they encountered barren land, they would plant a few seeds, and the assistant would put up a circle to prevent trampling. When the people nearby saw this, they were confused, and they hurried away. The assistant also said that he was a fool, but he did not lose heart because of this. He explained to [him], and continued his work.</p>
<p>A few years later, the open spaces in some parts of the Northwest were densely covered with apple trees. Disasters were reduced year by year because of this, and poor people could sometimes use apples as food to satisfy their hunger. At this time, Li Xun's goal had been achieved, and he had succeeded. Although he had died, he had worked hard without reward and died, but his soul was so happy!</p>
<p>Children, I do not hope that you will all become military strategists and politicians when you grow up. I only hope that you will be able to work hard and diligently in the future and do things that are truly beneficial to mankind!</p>
<h3>Bench and Sofa</h3>
<p>— By Su Ming</p>
<p>The clock struck four, and Yonger took his schoolbag, dragged his tired body, and returned home from school. As soon as he stepped into the door of his home, he busily dropped his schoolbag, poured a glass of plain water, and put his whole body on the sofa, feeling exceptionally comfortable. He was a young child, would attending these few hours of classes make him so exhausted? It's no wonder him, he went to school at seven o'clock in the morning, and rushed home at noon to eat a meal. In the afternoon, he had to go to class again at one-thirty, until four o'clock when school was dismissed. His school had fled from the mainland, so the equipment in the school was very simple, and the desks and benches in their classroom were as simple as can be—a narrow bench and a small desk had to seat four or five students. Therefore, each of them could only accommodate half a buttock on the bench. So, after attending such a long day of class, although it was not too exhausting, it was at least very strenuous.</p>
<p>At this time, he put most of his body comfortably on the sofa, took a sip of boiled water, and a look of comfort appeared on his face. He closed his eyes and rested quietly. But before a quarter of an hour had passed, the sound of the door opening disturbed Yonger, who was at rest. It turned out that his brother had also returned. "Brother, this sofa is very comfortable," he said to Zonger with a smile.</p>
<p>"Do you know why it's more comfortable to sit on a sofa?" Zonger asked him back. Yonger showed an impatient tone: "I won't argue with you. Anyway, it's comfortable because it's a sofa." "You mean it's comfortable because it's a sofa. That's not right. Are other chairs all uncomfortable? Do you want to know why it's comfortable to sit on a sofa?"</p>
<p>"Okay, you tell me." This question slightly aroused Yonger's attention.</p>
<p>"Let's use a bench and a sofa as examples to illustrate: we feel very strenuous sitting on a flat, hard, and narrow bench, but we feel very comfortable sitting on a large sofa with springs, because the area of contact between our body and the bench is very small, and the weight of our body is concentrated on this small area, so we feel strenuous. The sofa is concave and large, so the area that touches the body is much larger, which can distribute the weight of the body, and the body weight is distributed on a large area, so it is very comfortable." "Then it's always uncomfortable to sit on anything hard," Yonger interjected. "That's not how it is. It's comfortable to distribute the pressure on the body evenly. For example, when we sit on a sofa, it makes our uneven body fit the sofa, and we can sink deeply into it, so that the vitality of the body surface is distributed evenly in an unexpected way. But even sleeping on the hardest bed will not feel strenuous, as long as there is a condition: that is, the pressure can be evenly distributed over a large area. The method of making this hard but comfortable bed is very special: first lie on loose clay, and then print the marks of the body's bumps on the clay. Then use a large stone to carve a large bed according to the bumps of that mark, and then lie down as before, and it will be as comfortable as sleeping on a "Simmons" bed. However, I'm afraid I can't find such a stupid fool in the world to make such a big bed."</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (7)</h3>
<p>— By Min</p>
<p>Just then, the director and two or three other people came in. In an instant, everyone was silent. Our teacher then began to say to everyone, "This is Mr. Charles Lamond, the director of the Educational Film Company. I think he must have a few words to say to you ladies." So Mr. Lamond stepped forward. He was a very handsome man with a brown mustache, about the same age as my father. He began by saying that he knew that everyone already knew the reason he was here, so he didn't need to say much. Now he would like to ask you ladies to leave for ten or twenty minutes, and he would like to talk to the children alone. Mom reached out and twirled my curls around her finger a few times, then said to me softly, "Honey, if he asks you to dance or sing, you can just dance and sing as you usually do."</p>
<p>People often ask me what kind of performance I gave the director when I first met him. Did I feel nervous? Did I cry out in fright? Did I run away with my mother? They also asked me curiously if I walked up to Mr. Lamond at the time, smiled and said to him, "I'm Shirley Temple, let me dance for you!" Some people say, "You must have done something special to attract his attention, so he picked you out of so many children."</p>
<p>But I honestly tell them that I didn't do anything special at the time, I just walked past Mr. Lamond. That's what all the other kids did too, walking past Mr. Lamond one by one, reading him over. I myself don't know how I was chosen by him. It wasn't until three or four days later that Mr. Lamond called my mother and asked her to take me to the studio to try out the camera.</p>
<p>Many people have said to me, "I know that Mr. Lamond must be your favorite director. Shirley, tell the truth!" I got angry when I heard this and replied coldly, "I don't know which one is my favorite director!" Maybe this is also the truth. All the directors who made [perform] movies for me are my favorite directors. For example, when Mr. Lamond is my director, then he is my favorite director. There is also a Mr. Hamilton McFadden—I often call him Hamilton McFadden because that's what people call him. He directed Warner Baxter, Margie Evans, Johnny Bowers, Jimmy Dunn, Stan Pringle, and me in the film "Stand Up and Cheer," so he is also my favorite director. In short, I starred in many movies, so I have many favorite directors.</p>
<p>Some people also ask me if I had any special feelings when I first tried the camera at the studio. I almost always answer them like this: "I didn't feel anything at all." Sometimes I change my answer and say, "I just felt that everything was fine."</p>

<h3>Lloyd Returns to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— By Xin</p>
<p>In the silent film era, there were many comedic stars on the silver screen who were very popular, such as Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Harry Langdon. After the advent of sound films, there were Eddie Cantor, Jack Buchanan, etc. With the changing times, some of these stars have gradually lost their glory. Laurel and Hardy were the most popular for the longest time, but now their light is also gradually dimming.</p>
<p>Recently, Keaton and Langdon have tried to return to the silver screen, but without much success. Chaplin has become a solemn satirist. Lloyd has been absent for a long time, but he is now planning to remake his masterpieces "The Freshman" and "Grandma's Boy" (Chinese translations of the names are lost after many years). In these two films, he must change his style to cater to the tastes of the current trend. Whether he can be welcomed by movie fans again, let's see how the film turns out.</p>
<h3>Statistical Figures of "Gone With The Wind"</h3>
<p>— By Chan</p>
<p>"Gone With The Wind" was MGM's greatest production of last year, entirely in color. It will be screened at the Grand Theater from the 18th. The following are excerpts and translations of interesting figures related to the film:</p>
<p>The entire film cost US$3,957,000. Actor fees accounted for 4 percent, costume fees accounted for 12 percent, labor fees accounted for 39 percent, material fees accounted for 8 percent, transportation and lighting fees accounted for 7 percent, script, director, and reference fees accounted for 13 percent, and the remaining 17 percent was used for other miscellaneous expenses. The entire film was originally 475,000 feet long, and after complicated and troublesome editing procedures, it was reduced to 20,500 feet, and it took three hours and forty-five minutes to screen on the screen.</p>
<p>53 houses were specially built, 7,000 feet of streets, and 500 vehicles. 2,400 actors, 2,000 crew members, and 200 architects.</p>
<p>Vivien Leigh, who played the role of Scarlett O'Hara, changed a total of 38 sets of clothes and 20 hairstyles in this film.</p>
<p>The film's producer, David O. Selznick, bought the film production rights to "Gone With The Wind" for US$50,000.</p>
<p>One of the great sets in this film, "Tara's Mansion", cost a total of US$10,000. The carpets and wallpapers have 50 different patterns.</p>
<p>The scene where Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable danced, although only 60 seconds long, was practiced for a full 14 hours off-screen.</p>
<p>In order to find the leading actress Scarlett O'Hara, 1,400 girls from the southern United States failed. Among them, 28 went through the "Screen Test", consuming 149,000 feet of black and white film and 13,000 feet of color film.</p>
<p>The date that Vivien Leigh and the film's producer David Selznick signed the film contract was Friday, January 13, 1939.</p>
<h3>From Dialect to Singing</h3>
<p>As the poem says, "Eight sounds are in harmony, without conflicting order." The annotation for eight sounds is: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood. The ancients also said, "Silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as flesh." From this, we can see that the sound of singing surpasses all others. The reason why singing can surpass everything else is because its composition is more complex than any musical instrument. For example, when talking about the pipa, we can say the sounds of fingers are crisp; when talking about the Xiao and flute, we can say the sound is mournful. However, singing cannot be described so simply. Only when describing children can we say they are babbling.</p>
<p>I especially like listening to village girls singing folk songs, but they must articulate clearly and pronounce delicately to be pleasing to the ear. The reason why singing is more pleasant than instruments is mostly due to the articulation and pronunciation. Because of the lyrics, it is easier for people to understand the singer's emotions of joy, sorrow, separation, and reunion. Clear articulation is to make it easy for people to hear the words.</p>
<p>So, how can articulation achieve clarity? In China, it is not easy to achieve universality. People from Beijing speaking are considered wild and uncouth by people from Suzhou. People from Wuxi speaking are unintelligible to people from Zhenjiang. Can you imagine how complex this problem is? Therefore, regardless of the type of song, it must require a vocabulary that is universally suitable for dialects from various places. In Suzhou ballad singing, the word "flower" is not pronounced with pursed lips like people from Suzhou speak, but with an open mouth like people from Beijing speak. This is a clear sign of striving for universality. When ballad singers sing the words "adult," they do not read it as "du yin" in Suzhou dialect. In Peking Opera, young male roles often use an upward inflection when reading the word "person." The way Cheng Jixian and Xia Hesheng pronounce the word "person" is similar. The popular new songs now use the national standard pronunciation. However, the national standard pronunciation is not necessarily Beijing dialect. Logically, we should find it particularly clear, but the reality is not always the case. This is because the singers lack training. It is as if many female roles in Peking Opera pronounce "Qing Jia" (Your Majesty) as "Qin Jia" (relatives), but it certainly cannot be said to be a fundamental error of Peking Opera. In short, all current songs are progressing on the road to universality, and the pronunciation of words is of course no exception.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Work</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter One: "A very pretty Miss!"</p>
<p>The cigarette holder that Hawthorne picked up was originally placed on the left side of the desk, with the mouth of the cigarette holder protruding beyond the edge of the desk. It turned out that the mouth of the cigarette holder still contained an unburnt cigarette butt. The person who placed the cigarette holder was clearly preventing the desk from being burned, so they deliberately left the mouth of the cigarette holder exposed.</p>
<p>Hawthorne, staring at the cigarette holder in his hand, said to me, "Bao Lang, how much do you think this cigarette holder is worth?"</p>
<p>I moved closer to take a look. "Twenty or thirty cents, half a dollar at most."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded. "That's right. This is a cheap cigarette holder, but it is used very carefully. You can see from the color of this thing that it has been used for quite some time, but the cigarette holder itself has no scratches, and there are no tooth marks on the end. Even the copper ring inlaid on the pipe mouth, although the inner ring is already blackened, the outside is still polished very brightly."</p>
<p>I responded, "Yes, the owner of this cigarette holder seems to value this thing very much." Ni Jinshou also chimed in, "This thing is definitely not the ballerina's." Hawthorne said, "Naturally. Therefore, I feel that it seems necessary to pay attention to it." Ni Jinshou asked, "Could this cigarette holder give you any clues?" Hawthorne smiled and replied, "It's not to that point yet. But we can get a glimpse of the cigarette holder's owner's personality. This person is very cautious and economical with money. Look, the remaining cigarette butt has burned into the range of the copper ring." He brought the cigarette holder to his nose and sniffed it. "This cigarette is also definitely a cheap brand." Ni Jinshou asked, "Will there be fingerprints on it?"</p>

As he spoke, he put the cigarette holder back in its original place on the edge of the desk, and took the white cloth back into his pocket. Ni Jinshou said, "I'll go call that Li Zhiban downstairs." Hawthorne said, "Okay, - ah, wait a minute. There's a key left on the desk drawer. Did you see it?" (Sixteen)</p>
