<p>社評</p>
<h3>法國休戰後的種種</h3>
<p>德法休戰協定的內容，昨天纔經披露，傳到上海；這是今日報紙最適合時宜的論題，合該從協定論起，論到一切。不但記者理應如此，殆亦讀者期待如此。</p>
<p>破例的，記者懇求讀者予以原諒，當前論題雖不容放棄，但這一篇却是沒有結論的評論。不但沒有結論而已。按之評論的一般使命，或所謂代表輿論，報紙對於當前問題，將讀者心坎中的見解，代爲發揮。或所謂指導與論，報紙對於讀者所懷疑惶惑的問題，提供一種見解，爲讀者所同意採納。記者原來不敢目稱爲能代表，能指導；而今日論德法休戰協定，則非但不想代表，不想指導，且恐論之結果，更增加了讀者的煩悶。</p>
<p>煩悶是不得已的，因爲根本這是煩悶的問題，是全世界的煩悶。</p>
<p>德法休戰協定內容，根據英國方面路透社倫敦電訊，亦即尚非富事國的官報，共計二十一條：條文盡如本日新聞欄所刊布，茲不遑逐一加以註釋，加以說明。讀者細繹協定條文，必能體認在如此條款之下的法蘭西國，以及法蘭西人，今後的生存狀態，乃爲何種景象。</p>
<p>但請讀者注意：其一，這是德國對法國的條件，並不包括義國對法國的條件在內；故法國國族在這德法協定所殘餘的部分之中，尚須除去義國的條件，這纔是停戰後的「凈存」。其二，這是僅僅停戰協定，是自停戰以迄將來戰局完全結束爲止的過渡條件，亦即是臨時辦法，並非德法兩國之間在法理上具有永久性質的和的。其三，將來的和的是另一文章，和的得以種種因素，比較停戰協定，作種種程度之嚴酷；亦得以種種因素，比較停戰協定，作種種程度之寬讓；更得以種種因素，使停戰協定如白紙。種種又種種，皆有可能性，盡屬未知數。吾們至現在爲止，祗應對此停戰協定，明白認識其本質；至於前途如何，後果如何，不得已，請保留於煩悶之中。</p>
<p>德法停戰如此協定，姑不論前途，不論後果，但論目前我們所已經知道的反應：其一，與法國誼同一體，駢肩作戰的同盟國英國，宣告不承認接受這停戰協定的機構爲法國政府；其二，法國於總統勒勃倫氏與總理貝當將軍主持的法國政府，亦即爲其同盟國所否認的政府之外，將有所謂「法國臨時國民委員會」的產生，英國即將承認之爲同盟國的代表機構：其三，法國的若干殖民地與屬國以及若干海外法僑，陸績宣稱與英國携手，繼續作戰；其四，法國的若干軍艦業已參加英國的海軍隊伍，繼績作戰。這四項，是法國方面接受了停戰協定後，旣然的反應，大體亦可認爲根據事實的消息。</p>
<p>旣然的反應，事實的消息之外，吾們冉不必加些想像，以爲別方面更將如何如何。但就事實反應而言之，亦即有相應而生的當前疑竇：其一，接受停戰協定的法國政府，對於協定條款所規定的種種之中，頗有幾項並非一紙命令所得飭行有效的，則關於無法實踐的部份，是否將在德國方面引起協定以外的艱窘。其二，接受停戰協定的法國政府，一面早在戰勝國的威武之下，一面又被同盟約英國所唾棄，則在心理與行動上，感情與事實上，對德與對英一切的一切，立即遭遇了友乎敵乎的歧途，將如何取捨從違。其三，對德對英是絕對的兩面，由此兩面，在國際的無論那一角落裏，隱然或顯然的成爲對立的兩條路綫：對於這兩條路綫，我們冉不能刻舟　劍的，以爲有統一的整個的法蘭西國族的政策與態度，可以視爲他們的準則而推求了；然則關於法國國族在國際的一切、我們乃至任何非法國人，固將何所準則。總而言之，統而言之，以彼內在的紛歧，外在的錯綜，相除相乘，有得有失，種種逈小相同的可能，同時雜陳。凡百矛盾，無可權衡。『微妙』二字不足以盡其微妙，記者絕不敢自作解人而爲之結論。勉爲結論，靜觀種種更進一步的演變而已。</p>

<h3>風雲震盪中之　香港戰時準備　增加戰鬭兵員　擴大兵役範圍</h3>

<h3>歐戰初期形勢（七）</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>當德波戰起，英法對德將要宣戰的前夜，佛朗哥作了這樣的廣播：「我訴之於各國和各政府的責任心與他們的善意，希望盡量運用他們的努力，使這一個戰爭（指德波的戰爭——作者註）地方化。道一戰爭的擴大，必定造成探刻的，難以補救的世界經濟紊亂，造成世界富源的無數損失，並麻痺了世界的貿易，給予一般平民生活水凖以嚴重的打擊。這一戰如果愈加擴大的話，那末，未來更大戰爭的種子，也就種下了」。</p>
<p>這一段，是切實地說出了西班牙的懷抱。首先她承認德波戰是應該的；其次，她反對英法「擴大」戰事；如果英法對德宣戰呢，那末，她們就是擾亂世界經濟生活的戎首；而附帶，就給了英法一個西班牙也許參加的恐嚇。</p>
<p>（六）其他宣佈「中立」的國家（九月二十）</p>
<p>歐洲第二次大戰，自九月一日德波戰揭開了幕以來，到今天，整整二十天了。除了上面已經述過了的各國在這一戰裏的地位而外，其餘的國家的態度，也是了解這决歐戰形勢圖畫中必不可缺少的部份。在這裏，我先給她們一個暫時的總分類。</p>
<p>歐洲的政治單位，由上次歐戰遺留下來的，是三十五個：英，意，瑞典，挪威，丹麥，荷蘭，比利時，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，巨哥斯拉夫，保加利亞，亞爾巴尼亞，冰島，法，德，波蘭，芬蘭，愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，立陶宛，捷克斯拉夫，奥地利，瑞士，希臘，西班牙，葡萄牙，土耳其，聖馬力諾，安道耳，蘇維埃聯邦，盧森堡，摩納哥，利支敦士登，愛爾蘭自由邦，但澤自由市。</p>
<p>可是，這次大戰未起前，已經消滅了存在的，是捷克斯拉夫，奥地利，亞爾巴尼亞，等三國。</p>
<p>作爲德國進攻波蘭導火綫的，却是但澤自由市。參加作戰的，是德國爲一邊，英法波爲另一邊。共計四國。蘇聯的地位，不同於任何國，而有着特殊意義。</p>
<p>義大利宣佈「不參戰」，但明顯的，她是德國的同盟；西班牙宣佈了「中立」，然而，在態度上，偏向着德國。——這兩國是一類。</p>
<p>土耳其宜佈了對英，法同盟約「忠實」，然而，也沒有參戰；羅馬尼亞，事實上，等於英，法的同盟，然而却宣佈了「中立」。——這兩國，爲另一類。</p>
<p>把上面這十三個政治單位除去了之後，在歐洲，還剩下二十二個政治單位。這裏面，有兩個到現在還沒有正式表示「中立」。——匈牙利，希臘。</p>
<p>其餘的，全都先後宣佈了所謂「中立」。這裏，是她們當中三個比較重要國家的態度。</p>
<p>比利時——上次歐戰受到池魚之災的比利時，這一次，又是首當其衝。理論上說，爲了戰略關係，而把她牽入漩渦的交戰國，有着更多可能的，應該是德國。所以，以這一假定　出發點，她的防禦工事，完全是向着德國那一面。然而事實上呢，主觀上希望她加入漩渦的，英，法也並不差於德國，因爲她們佔計，比利時不加入則已，加入的話，一定是在英，法這一面，那意思是在說，英，法方面，可以立刻多了一個同盟國。所以，近來英，法的宣傳和德國宣傳，恰恰成了兩個有趣的對照。德國在竭力否認有任何侵入比利時的企圖，相反的，却說英，法想侵犯她的中立；同時，竭力鼓勵她抵抗。跟下來，就放出了威脅：一如果比利時默認英，法破壞她的中立的話，那末，德國也就有便宜行動的權利，不再負任何尊重她中立的義務了。」英，法方面呢，則在天天提醒上次歐戰的敎訓，鼓勵她準備德國的侵入，並且說：「比利時大可以放心，在德軍第一天踏上比利時的領土時，英，法聯軍也就立刻可以開來赴援了。」無而，站在比利時的立塲上看，她旣沒有擴張領土的野心，又不願把自己領土獻出來當別人的戰塲，所以，她的最有利的途徑，是一個名符其實的到底「中立」。因而，交戰國兩方面的宣傳和壓力，都是令她　痛的事。英，法和德國一宣戰時，比利時也立刻下了全國總動員令，並不是準備加入任何方面打仗，而確實的，是準備「保障自身的中立地位」。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　華商四起拋外匯</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、潛勢漫長、尤以美匯本日獨鬆、乃晨初因英美互匯猛漲一角三分餘之故、全日買賣顯呈熱烈、華銀行如華橋上海等四起售出、爲鬆動之主因、而華商投機家未聞進出、致扒戶甚缺、午前最硬美匯爲六元一二五、午收尚定、至午後市狀態愈形硬化、六七月掉期、華行對做爲六元一二五與六元、計貼出一二五、且日行正金亦來求售現美匯頗夥、價一度做達六元一五六二五、但美行吃胃不薄、致鬆後略形回平、結果收盤、英金爲三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元〇九三七五、較上週六收、英無榮辱、美猛長一二五期貨亦硬、</p>
<p>外銀行亦懷賣意</p>
<p>晨初以匯兌、英對美不動對滬亦平、對法未更、美對英長一角三分七五、對滬大二角、對法無電、中央掛牌各匯如　、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士九三七五、美匯六元〇六二五、較之上週六晚收、英緊〇三一二五、美則反硬〇九三七五、乃匯兌猛漲之故、開後華銀行均來售出、市面帶硬、計華行售予外行及美行七月份美匯已爲五元九三七五、以至九六八七五、後華行上海賣出同月美匯竟告六元、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉、亦無增减、此後有利及美行亦滿懷供意、故價更覺鬆動、計六月份英金外行入有利曁美行爲三辦士九六八七五、且斯時美匯最長已告六元一二五、惟不久因美行等停止售出、市象遂轉定、迨至千收、英金爲三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元〇九三七五、六月份與現貨同價、七月份英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯五元九六八七五、比晨開現貨英金鬆〇三一二五、美匯亦長〇三一二五、期貨一致告硬、</p>
<p>美匯猛鬆一二五</p>
<p>午後開出市面仍形硬化、計華銀行曾對掉美匯本月份六元一二五、七月份爲六元、計貼出一二五、嗣日行正金來市售出現貨美匯賤達六元一五六二五、惟日行雖賣出不少、美行吃胃不弱、致價反形回平、結果英金告三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元〇九三七五、七月份英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯六元、較上週末收現貨英平、美猛長一二五、七月份英亦平、美則鬆一五六二五、</p>

<p>天津英美匯價縮</p>

<h3>藏金興趣淡薄　烚赤祇有搶帽交易</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、疲莫能興、以滙市潛勢仍鬆、且缺乏利多消息、經營者執金興趣、突見减少、有則搶帽子性而已、論買賣結果、晨初即弱、開盤低八十元、爲五千四百三十元、銀號證券帮粉紛售出、立撳至五千三百五十元低價、後賴某錢兌業等拖入、復高達五千四百七十五元、惟交易極稀、午收爲五千四百元、後市開價祇五千三百九十元、且於證券帮銀號續賣之下、又降至五千三百五十元、結果又賴錢兌業及某銀號收買、告五千四百元收盤、較上週六跌一百十元、收後小挫至五千三百九十元、後有法日間某種傳說、故最後五千四百三十元、全日有一百二十五元上落、成交尚旺、約三千兩光景、銀樓飾金計掛低二十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>現金軋小一百十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯兌猛長、美匯報鬆、人心虛疲、開市即暴落八十元、金號出錢兌業二十兩、爲五千四百三十元、繼賴某銀號曁證券帮拖入、曾回升三十元、銀號互做十兩爲五千四百六十元、旋外滙依然走鬆、另一銀號及某金號競向拋塞、猛撳一百十元、銀號出錢兌業三十兩、遜爲五千三百五十元、此後某銀號仍來撈進加碼、且外匯潛勢略轉、一般散戶拋空者紛來抵補、同時金號帮亦來搜入、遂回出五千四百元大關、銀號互做二十兩、爲五千四百七十五元、午刻市勢復向下游、因某金號仍滿懷賣意、再見步退數十元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲五千四百元、午後開時景况仍疲、首由證券帮出銀號等共十兩、遜爲五千三百九十元、嗣因證券帮續來吐出、同時某錢兌業亦賣、再小二十元、證券帮出金號三十兩、爲五千三百七十元、後以金號前來撈入、賣者轉少、遂回漲二十五元、金號進證券帮二十兩、爲五千三百九十五元、其時證券帮重懷賣意、某銀號跟之拋空、步跌四十五元、某銀號出銀樓帮二十兩、爲五千三百五十元、入後人心漸轉、買戶增多、錢兌業銀號等頻購、回升五十元、銀號互做三十兩、爲五千四百元作晚收價、結果比上週末軋跌一百十元、全天一百二十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金懸五百五十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十元、迨九時三十五分掛小十元、午後二點半又掛低十元、此後無變化、計大同行改懸五百五十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>貼現回升二元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、略見回上、每千元始終貼進爲七十五元、貼出須八十元、比上日回升二元、錢業公會拆息亦升起一分、計二角六分云、</p>
<h3>外幣軟化</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤忽又趨低、英美金鎊跟隨下跌英金票供求尚平衡、市價站穩、美金票始因鎊價突長、晨開退至十六元二角、嗣雖曾兩次漲到十六元半、但終又趨低、結果比上週六軋跌一角半、香港票供給旺盛、市價甚軟、羅比票及菲列濱票均不乏供給、市價低落、日金票供求均勻、市價站穩、晚市爲一元零九分、朝鮮票稍有需要、市價略漲、晚市爲九角六分、</p>
<h3>洋米立瀉一二元　粳米堅持不肯鬆落　且看錫米商之決心</h3>
<p>洋米市自經週前報載南洋航運糊可通行、而海防對於貨品亦無封鎖之舉、當時市面、若無內地暢銷、早有回疲之勢、昨則開市旣以星期休業一天、人心尚難捉摸、都呈觀望、而內地浙省去路、突以某方頒佈滬杭綫搬運米糧自即日起又須領取護照、一般客家在手續未經就緒、及嗣後又多一筆費用、尚須推合之下、悉告停頓、市形因之淸寂異常、際此浮囤散戶、目見人勢不佳、又當價高險多之間、乃即不再靜窺、紛紛甩價拋出、一時絮相競脫、喊價頻降、做開二號西貢已祗六十一元半、銀行棧小絞六十元零五角、浦東棧六十元零三角、東京砶尖五十九元半、及至午後、洋米新訂已經證實、由愼記洋行拋出二號暹米本月廿六日裝船一千八百五十噸、價祗六十四元三角、比之市上回籠貨便宜三四元之鉅、人心軟弱、獲利盡吐、投機絕跡、市乃猛瀉一二元不等、繼有數度盤旋、而結果終呈軟象、加之透雨陣陣、進戶納胃亦呆、二號暹米與二號貢米晚收均祇六十一元左右、小絞六十元零三四角、少數急脫之小絞、則竟有降進六十元關、爲五十九元八角、回籠十八裝二號暹米早市六十七元、比週六小一元半、旋自六十七元五角至六十八元、但晚市亦乏受主、全日期貨回籠二百五十噸、現八千包、</p>
<p>又訊洋米源源來滬、太古公司廣東輪於上週六到滬、自香港運來二萬零零八包、昨已起卸完竣、又該公司新疆輪於二十三日到埠、亦自香港裝來一萬一千七百八十四包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>粳糯國米、到貨雖蟬聯而不夥、兩共祗近千包、致時雨滂霈、而粳米暗盤、人心仍堅、不以洋米及甘霖影響、成交尚多、售價與前相仿、常帮特淸粳七十五元、蘇崑及常州粳七十三四元、靑泗特薄稻七十三四元、大市七十一二元、次至宿貨七十元、南港早稻六十九元、糯米以銷塲轉遜、形勢不若前之堅固、價貶半元光景、開金溧特元六十元、丹常白元五十八九元、江北貨五十七元左右、</p>
<p>無錫碾米同業會二十日開會決定勸告同業、將存貨儘量出售、以應門市、幷議定限價、粳稻每担二十元五角、糙粳每石四十元、白粳四十三元、不得再漲、以維民食、各米廠須負責自動拒絕某商大量採辦、搬運出境、如誰家違的、即停止同業買賣、各行廠全體蓋章遵守、（知）</p>
<h3>麺漲半元</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨二號粉廠盤、由十三元八角漲至十四元三角、比前陡加半元、其漲風之由來、因華廠方面、受新麥被阻影響、原料勢將告罄、頗有無貨供應之勢、業經集議補救辦法、議決所有客帮囤戶一概停售、而照目前本街實銷數額、照常供給、故將廠盤實行增加、惟目下米價昂貴聲中、本街之銷量、與日俱增、統市由廠家直接配出者、亦不下一萬包、回籠貨因廠盤提高、更爲佾利、老車脾喊價十五元、碌砲車與天竹等粉、喊價十七元、但均非正式市面、</p>
<p>又訊　查自米價昂貴以來、麵粉即爲一般平民所注意、而廠方產量有限、竟有應接不暇之勢、聞天津方面已訂購澳粉洋粉拾餘萬包、而本埠糧商亦有訂購洋粉消息、據傳津帮所定係澳洲粉、本埠定開者爲美國粉、額計五萬餘包、價爲十五元五角、合價尚稱廉宜、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥來源、仍難恢復常態、日廠方面、迭有收進、其情形特殊、非可同日而語、而華廠方面、以目下環境惡劣、無法直向產區採辦、不得已放價開始向糧商行客及某方收買、聞昨日阜豐廠收進蕪湖及江北新麥五百餘包、價爲二十四元三角至二十四元、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債依然平庸</h3>
<p>證券昨日市價、依然無與奮狀態、此漲彼跌、全不一致、內種曾一度高達五十元、價高召賣主、午後旋又進關、但甲種又抬至六十一元、環境情形變化多端、利空利多、莫衷一是、市塲之呆滯、半由於浮多逐漸减少、浮空則伸縮無定、半由於時局雖極混沌、謠言　起、而公債本身付本還息、仍可由銀行墊出、一喜一憂、互相牽制、故每日不斷的在小範圍內動盪不已、昨日兩市買賣、無非檯面少數人搶帽子交易而已、成交仍衹三十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價爲六十九元七角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所昨日股市、殊少變動、英聯與怡和股、又最普及</p>
<h3>紗花　南銷被阻後　有維持紗價說</h3>
<p>紗市又形平疲、但趨勢稍見安定、不過實際交易較爲淸淡此因香港邊境、日軍騷擾不休、對於內地方面、運輸益感困難、人心不振、但浙東方面、近來採辦　爲活動惟額量甚少、不過下跌程度已深、有人出來收進、維持市面矣、否則六月份恐生枝節也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因十日人氣堅昂而續佳、二十支雙馬價爲九白九十元、詎料高價一開、賣者紛至沓來、因廣帮生意又屬停頓、形勢更虛、直跌至九百四十元、一霎間買戶又增、多說謂廠方出來收進、維持市面、於是一鼓頹勢被其挽回、又復漲至九百六十元、收盤價爲九百五十三元、但收盤之後、做至九百六十六元、查半日間成交統計一千四百八十包、行情跌二十四元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　七〇　同行一、二七〇</p>
<p>寗波　一四〇　統計一、四八〇</p>
<h3>廠辦停頓　棉花暗盤亦少</h3>
<p>現棉情形依然呆滯無特色、外面人心甚弱、因各方皆無需要也、同時棉紗市象不振、廠家不活動、雖有一二筆暗盤成交、然額子微乎其微、行盤亦廉也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、殊爲靜寂、後華爾街之在市購買、及現貨商之買進、市况轉形活躍、結果收盤價格、較之七日漲起八九磅音、印度市况堅定、昨日漲起四羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來頗爲沉悶、各方心意淡薄、目前現貨之售價已廉於洋行方面之期貨價、尚乏人問津也、按照目前市况、不知將於何日始能轉機也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　錫繭商上騙局　收了農家繭　不發農家錢</h3>
<p>錫武澄三縣、有大小繭行三百餘家、大半代「華中公司」收繭、當時訂立合同、假立一鮮繭價目、如蘭價漲落、則按照報告表大扯盤、升降計算、至付軟時、除訂的時先付一小部定洋、其餘俟乾繭運城、銀貨兩交、開秤時因情形特殊、仍照上年例、由各繭行出立聯票、的期散發、說明乾滿運城、領到款項、回鄉發結、現在乾繭已大部運城、各行向「華中公司」要求、照約付款結賬、距以繭價問題、迄未談妥、而鄉間蠶戶、持有聯票者、有數萬戶之多、因現款至今無着、紛紛持票向繭行坐索、迭起風波、各行主無法對付、紛紛至錫、三縣收滿商集會討論、向「華中公司」交涉、若不迅謀解決、尚有留鄉乾繭、恐難運城、照此情形、農民育蠶辛苦、如難得現款、恐成泡影矣、（良）</p>
<h3>無錫蠶絲來滬　繳稅三百元　同業謀對策</h3>
<p>無錫蠶絲來滬、日來雖未實行抽捐百分之十二、然已備受限制現有若干件蠶絲、已得搬入證（所謂派司）、計每担須繳派司費法幣三百元、七月以後則尚須繳納近六〇〇元之特捐、昨日絲廠同業公會、特召開會議、以謀對付云、</p>
<h3>日絲下跌</h3>
<p>昨紐約無市、橫濱絲價下落、現貨一四四五元、跌十五元、近期一四五一元、跌二十元、遠期一五一〇元、跌十七元、本埠絲市沉寂、似尚無展開希望云、</p>
<p>又人造絲昨日由香港來五十箱、</p>
<h3>外銷茶全部停頓</h3>
<p>本市洋莊紅綠茶銷路、日來完全停頓、蓋自意國實行參戰後、地中海航運中斷、各洋行近來報裝箱茶、均已全部退關、以致人心不振、交易毫無、惟內銷茶葉、北方去路、日來略見起色、最近天津帮搜辦毛峰雨前紅梅等貨、一千八百餘包、即將裝運出口云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東貨回漲　國布帶昂</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市略見昂騰、蓋最近布價暴落後、東疋回漲有力、且各地得雨、市氣頗形轉機、本街需要漸旺、客帮亦有吸納、售盤平平、跌勢已戢、本街成交粗布二百餘件、坯布漂染布近三百件、溫甬帮辦細斜粗布色布一百數十件、港帮辦細斜細布五六十件、北路靑島天津等帮辦漂布藍布綫呢二百餘件、昨有夏布一百五十四件由寗波運到、</p>
<p>東布　漲風續盛、龍頭細布晨開每疋卅一元五角、因秦皇島帮採辦、本街人心看好、補空甚旺、愈抬愈高、至午收盤爲卅二元五角、後市暗盤復升至卅三元、嗶嘰升至八角九分、洋行晨開下月份細布三百餘件、訂價卅三元五角起卅四元二角半止、</p>
<h3>西洋呢絨　貨缺價貴</h3>
<p>西洋貨呢絨、不論光毛厚薄、英製·製·義製·波蘭製·市貨統皆軋缺而貴、下半年需銷之秋冬貨、格外緊佾、行號方面、手中有存現貨、莫不一律居奇、齊不顧滙稟之緊縮、國內外時局如何轉移、人心始終樂觀、兼之現在川滇黔幫續有開辦、各路做單幫者、購剪殷盛、惟運輸困難、嗣後總可設法、</p>
<h3>油餅　漲跌異趨</h3>
<p>昨日油餅市情、榮辱不同、豆餅得天雨之助、滋長不少人心、各方辦胃熱閙、行情因之昂砌二角、計開大有四牌餅四千片、價爲十二元六角至六角半、訂月底交三千片、價爲十二元七角、肥字餅六車、價爲十二元一角半至二角、甡記餅五千片、價爲十二元一角至三角、靑中餅二千片、價爲十一元三角、豆油因乏實銷、投機殊少興趣、一部份雖被强行支持、但正市依然疲　如故、做開大連豆油七十桶、價詳市價欄、青島豆油十桶、浦東廠豆油五十担、及大有廠豆油一百担、花生油平疲不一、聽裝油得香港幫採辦、故平簍裝者祇本街一路動動、所以市面仍疲、昨計成交膠州油一百五十件、價爲六十九元、比前跌半元、江北本坊油八百聽、價爲原盤一百元、及靑島桶油十桶、價爲九十六元云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤原盤不動</h3>
<p>白煤行情、因海防封鎖傳聞、雖一度緊張、暗盤扶搖直上、但終因本市存底充實、而來源無恐、故昨市仍守原盤不動、計開同業拆價、鴻基白煤每噸二百十六元、一號小子元百十四元、同得利一二號塊每噸二百十元、鴻基白煤屑一百四十元、以上均棧房自車、送到另加行槓、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖升沉靡定</h3>
<p>昨糖市以進戶轉稀、趨勢回軟、又見小跌、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、外棧六十九元三角、小三角、轉口貨七月二日交貨五十五元半、小二角、即打棧單者五十四元八角、小五角、太古車白西棧B嘜八十元半、東棧八十元、無更動、荷赤亦站定五十九元半、國糖有廣幫開出高海南赤一百包、五十二元、决之五十一元半至五十元、刁靑數十包、潮規六十二元八角、昨有糖三百六十包由香港運來、</p>
<h3>南北貨　青笋干轉跌</h3>
<p>靑笋干近以黃霉水發、產區仍可利用竹排輪運、來源可望通暢、近日已到六七百件、價乃轉降、昨市行盤早元每小簍三元二角、肥挺三元、禿挺二元六角、比最高價須跌七八角、</p>
<h3>五金　洋釘跌價後　盤元跟小</h3>
<p>新盤元市面自洋釘跌價後、即告一蹶莫振、最近以來、越南及華南諸地形勢日趨嚴重、是處之客商無暇採辦物品、查洋釘之唯一大銷塲、爲南洋羣島及越南南海之諸大商埠、刻旣形勢大變、洋釘富無貨裝往、該數帮各商當亦無意採辦、故洋釘市况、莫不受其重大之打擊、本埠建築帮及零星買戶、雖不時點綴、唯爲數却微、所以刻市釘趨勢十分惡劣、價由六十五五元跌至六十元左右、致使新盤元行盤亦步趨下游、昨市每洋擔售五十五元、亦相率落四元不等云、</p>

<h3>手淫過度者　美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師　婚後性弱的秘療法</h3>
<p>橫在靑年面前最重大的隱憂，厥爲不正當的性行爲。手淫亦爲變態性行爲之一。不僅靑春男子都有此癖，而女性羣中亦多秘密犯此者。</p>
<p>須知男女若無性行爲爲之媒介，則愛情淡薄，西諺有云：「男子求女子之愛，女子許男子以身。」誠哉其不虛也。則女子安肯以身許其丈夫，由此衡之，凡手淫過度的靑年，若不知害戒絕，極力治療，婚後性神經衰弱難免，而愛情之破裂，自在意中。其甚者，妻子每因春事久曠而別謀對象，故弱夫壯妻，往往發生姦通之情事。吾國古代詩人，以夫妻好合，比之琴瑟，故詩曰：「夫婦好合，如鼓琴瑟。」斯誠有得之言。蓋必雙方性感協調，同一性感之感受性，一方快美達於頂點，她方決美亦達於頂點，正如琴瑟之共鳴，斯其好合，方能永久。</p>
<p>手淫之害，性力之重要，旣如上述，故吾人在結婚後若感覺腎虧及其他種種腦神經衰弱症，脊髓神經衰弱症，亦接踵暴發，生命亦感危殆，故治療之法，須從增精補血着手，服以德國舉丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，在生理上即可促進新陳代謝之機能，增添新精血。在醫界早已公認爲治療性神經衰弱症的特效良藥，其所採取動物之睪丸素，均經細心注意與精密的科學提煉而成，其女用者功能調經種子，余在臨床上應用九年，從未遇失效之病例。</p>
<h3>腎虧症治驗報告</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>患者夏鳴崗，年卅三歲，於廿四歲時結婚後，因婚前荒淫，婚後縱慾，致年來精力日衰，性神經表弱症病態百出，不僅勃起力喪失，而面色蒼白，骨瘦如柴，體重僅九十一磅。自知若不早治，後息堪虞，故特來院求治云云。（診時病象）——陰痿，神經衰弱，滑精，結婚八年，從未生育，日間常有頭痛，耳鳴心悸等症，入夜失眠盜汗。（治療之法）——令渠嚴守攝生，短期禁慾，除攝取富有滋養料之食物外，並面授攝生方法，每日投以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」每决三片，睡前並服以止遺等藥「耐而斯還精片」三片，一個月之後，遺精滑精已止，食慾增加，體重僅增一磅，兩個月之後，腦弱，失眠已止，面色紅潤，體重又增一磅半，三個月之後，體重增四磅，四個月之後，腎虧陰痿澈底根治，半年後，體重共增十磅，諸症全消乃停服。</p>
<h3>淋毒之前後因果及療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士王克春</p>
<p>淋毒之變化千萬，但亦有其前因後果之線索可尋。此種線索，在具有經驗之醫師，憑其優良的療法，作根本的治療，則淋病之剷除，並非難事也。若淋病變化之來，乃由於淋菌在吾人體內，作無限制之破壞，凡淋菌在前尿道而不迅速撲滅之者，必轉爲後尿道炎，後尿道炎而不速治者，必又更深一層而成爲攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等症，此等症狀之發生，實由於撲滅淋菌療法之不徹底，就余分析各種內服藥之實騐，惟有最新化學療法「新克淋儂」（中英有售），作爲內服劑，自能將殺菌力直達病灶，撲滅所有之淋菌，因「新克淋儂」係用淋病的化學療法，專能剿滅淋菌，與一般化學療法，反應十分强大，而且作用並不純粹者，大不相同，原來此「新克淋儂」係德國彼德博士所發明，且經過許多各國許多專家實驗證明此藥能治愈一切新舊淋病。至外可用「抗淋水」按圖洗滌尿道，尤有相得益彰之妙</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>姚菊巖醫師診所：寧波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病不徹底根治之害</p>
<p>余對於淋病之治療，前後已不下二十餘年，對於淋病，如病家能完全信任余之療法，則余無不盡力治療，使其完全根本治愈爲止，而絕不作不徹底的敷衍療法，以爲塞責，惟一般病家，往往因性情急燥，以爲余在數天內，即能奏到大效，而以爲病勢已去，不再來余處治療，結果些將愈之淋病，功虧一簣，又致再發。不僅前功盡棄，而月病勢較前爲烈，病家每又來乞余治療，余雖仍能負責根治，然於治療的時間上，不免延長，在療法上言，則一切不合理之治療，均宜摒棄，而當施用最合科學的療法，將慢性期的淋菌，從深處，從廣泛處之淋菌，完全撲滅不留一枚病，以免再發。要達到此等完全根治之目的，惟有服用偉大發明之淋病特效藥「新克淋儂」（華英有售），及德國感應靜電療法，X線療法，皆可根本剷除之，因「新克淋儂」之殺菌力，能隨血液之循環，將散處體內之淋菌，加以掃滅，因之淋菌遂無法在吾人體內托足之可能，而根本解決。更用敏捷手術以矯正病態，即能達到徹治之任務矣　兼治梅毒橫痃下疳性神經衰弱</p>
<h3>肺結核之自療</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病一稱富貴病，因爲此病極其難愈，對於病家之經濟與體力方面，作持久性之消耗，如果能經得起此種病菌之侵襲，及有經濟力爲之支持。則此種癆病，未嘗無根本向愈之望。通常多以住療養院，爲應付此病最佳之法，但此種療養，起碼爲一般小布爾喬亞所能勝任，中下階級，多無力及此。幸而現在已發明家庭自療新法，即服用德國肺病專家徒梅博士所發明之肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，可將各期肺病，如初起或第二三期之肺病，完全治愈。因爲「補肺拿爾」具有直接扑滅結核菌，與彌補肺部空洞之作用。凡潮熱，盜汗，吐血，喀痰不爽，食慾不佳，服者均可短期奏功。確爲肺病家庭自療之神品。</p>

<p>滬西徐家匯鎭、戰前由市政府管轄、自國軍西撤後、法相界當局、以該地一帶、設有難民區、且以法國天主敎會、在該區擁有產業甚多、故派軍進駐該地、並在該鎭慈佑路匯站街暫設巡捕房一所、在衝要地點分佈崗位、維持秩序、歸法租界管理、二年餘來、相安無事、且以地處偏僻、居戶不多在此租界中人潮汹湧之際、一般工廠機關、頗多遷移該處、故該處實有調劑租界中人口之功効、間接對租界中治安之維持、亦有幫助、詎自前日日僞憲警突侵入該處、致謠言蠭起、人心惶惶、情勢頗見緊張等情、已見昨日本報、續據調查、法租界當局、已與日偽妥協、於今晨一時起、將該地移交日僞接受、茲記詳情於後、</p>
<p>醖釀已久　最近妥恊</p>
<p>最近以日僞方面藉口該地已無難民、要求法方將防軍及捕房撤退、聞此項交涉、由法租界當局與偽「市府」間進行談判、已有多日、迨至昨日、業已完全解決、法方以環境惡劣、不願引起糾紛、表示讓步、已於昨晚十二時起、將防軍及捕房撤至租界以內、於今晨一時起、交由日偽方面接管、據日軍發言人昨晚在招待記者席上、亦已承認「此一問題、將於今日（即明日）解決、」但不願將經過情形發表、惟法租界當局與日大使館發言人、旣不尤加以證實、亦未予吾認、</p>
<p>居民聞訊　相率遷移</p>
<p>自前日日偽憲警侵人該處後、昨晨、日軍復在附近舉行演習、一般居民、因小知將變成何種局面、均大形恐慌、遂紛紛遷徙、昨日下午、雖大雨滂沱、然遷徙者反愈見增加、徐家匯各馬路上、箱籠車輛、連接不絕、均爲雨水淋濕、一般居氏、則扶老携幼、羣向租界走避、交頭接耳、頗現驚惶之狀、至該處之法租界臨時捕房、自前日終夜將文件器物搬出後、昨日已僅剩空屋矣、</p>
<p>交界地點　架置鐵綱</p>
<p>海格路貝當路徐家滙路交點、素爲徐家匯鎭與法租界間之唯一孔道、昨日該處已被日僞憲警、架置鐵絲網、僅餘五尺長之空罅一處、以便電車及行人之出入、惟該罅口處、昨日尚無日僞人員駐守、故居民尚能自由出入、至海格路上、本築有鐵絲網綫兩道、一隣接華界、一在租界中間即爲馬路、現隣接華界之鐵絲網、已爲日僞人員、撤除凈盡、即木桿亦均被拔去、</p>
<p>天文臺仍　照常工作</p>
<p>徐家匯區域內之天文臺、爲遠東方面報告及觀測氣象之重要處所、將來法捕房探捕全數撤退時、天文台之工作、頗爲航業方面所關注、茲據探悉、該台昨照常工作、將來亦不致停頓、蓋該處氣象台等、殊無法遷移、並已決定續在原處工作、此外徐家滙天主堂·神學院·修道院·主敎住宅等、亦不準備遷移、</p>
<p>鎭內情形　尙稱安謐</p>
<p>昨日徐家匯鎭內日軍用卡車及日偽憲警時有往來、居民雖多不安、然一般秩序、尚稱安定、徐匯中學·徐匯女中·啟明女中·等校、昨日均照常上課、徐家匯法天主敎堂仍安全、商店亦大多照常營業、惟昨日下午二時許、大雨傾注時、徐匯收容所極長之竹籬圍牆、突被貧民數百、全部拆毀、携回作燃料之用、華捕雖駐守在旁、然爲避免惹事、亦僅目覩而已、</p>
<p>租界邊區　防務加嚴</p>
<p>法租界警務當局爲保持西區安寗、昨日特加派大批探捕、分佈海格路通入租界之各路口、對行人車輛、檢查甚嚴、被日僞用鐵絲網阻斷之徐家匯路底、其隙口處並有鐵甲車一輛、及探捕多名駐守、防範極爲周密、徐家匯鎭內昨日法捕及安南巡捕已甚少發現、惟白俄及華捕仍在該鎭各處維持秩序、當地已風傳昨晚有撤退之說、但未能證實、</p>

<h3>法幣携往邊省　取消禁令　由昆赴港滬津各地　仍以五百元爲限額</h3>
<p>財政部前爲防杜資金逃避及維持滙市之安全起見、曾經制訂防止水陸空私運特種物品進口辦法、規定携運金銀金銀製品及鈔票、前往邊省邊界、或由邊省邊界携運內地者、應受嚴格之限制、此項辦法曾由部准行政院通告旅客知照、嗣後財政部爲嚴密限制鈔票之携運、另</p>

<h3>興亡之跡盛衰靡常　歷史戯劇重演　大陸報記者歐游觀感　法德和議彼此循環報復　異日禍根業已孕育胚胎</h3>
<p>當德法媾和消息傳滬之際、本埠大陸報編輯羅蕭特君、作二年半旅行歐洲後、忽自美返滬、回館復職、並發表其饒有興趣之文字稱、「當希特勒下令將一九一八年簽訂和議而當有歷史性之客車帶回柏林時、渠實已孕育德法在未來之五十年至五百年中再度戰爭之胚胎、法人當記憶力、萬事所不忘懷、對於任何錯誤、必獲致補償而後已、此點法人實雅有中國之精神、過去二年、余旅行於巴黎柏林之間每不免有懷古之思、</p>
<p>凡爾塞宮　　無人跡</p>
<p>當吾等過凡爾塞時、曾歷游各饒有歷史興趣之地、並參觀凡爾塞宮、宮中雖闃無人跡、但壁上畫幅、懸掛如舊、未嘗有人敢予損毀、其中有密勒斯大厦、即一九一九年召開和會之所在、厦中守衛、絮絮爲吾等指點陳述、若者爲美總統威爾遜之座、若者爲德·法·代表之席、</p>
<p>普法戰事　於此簽約</p>
<p>余頗訝歐戰和議、何以舉行於此空庭冷落之凡爾塞宮中、而不就巴黎舉行、就詢於守衛者、守衛者曰、「余願告君以其中原由、和議之所以在密勒斯大厦舉行者、蓋此處即一八七一年普魯士王强迫吾等結束普法戰事、而簽訂和議之所在也、」</p>
<p>同一餐車　重演舊劇</p>
<p>彼又復告余、舉行和議之長桌、完全安放原處並未更動、現希特勒又復强迫法人於同一之餐車中媾和、蓋在此車內、即一九一八年法方擊退德人之所在也、但希氏誠恐將來法人之重彈舊調、而反復不已、　預爲防止、而將客車帶回柏林、</p>
<p>德戰利品　法人索回</p>
<p>數週前、余訪問巴黎後、重抵柏林、識一即將赴德東南某地加入坦克車隊之德人、曾與偕訪林登無名英雄紀念碑、而於其附近之一水門汀之臺上、發現一舊式運軍火之車、車上有銅牌、友爲譯其意云、此車上之砲、一八七一年普魯士軍隊在法獲得之戰和品也、一九一九年、巴黎和議之際、法人曾要求將砲交還、而仍尤其保存此車、今當希特勒叱咤風雲之際、此林登之車上、其仍將要求法人返還其砲吾、若然、則吾人可信於下一次之戰事中法人獲勝、亦必將要求其砲與空車併還巴黎矣、」</p>
<h3>銀行經營投機事業　部令制止　各銀行應以身作則　行員尤應恪守行規</h3>
<p>上海游資充斥之後、造成投機事業之猖獗、聞各商業銀行、竟利用存款、除囤積貨物以外、復以全力購買外滙、對外名爲「保障存款」、實爲企圖發其國難財、各銀行職員、上自經理、下至練習生、均從事投機、爭購外滙與囤積貨物、使社會人心發生動盪、此外銀行職員代其親戚故舊購買外滙者、亦復不少、按銀行本身、以及職員、從事投機買賣、原在禁止之列、今財政部得密　後、已嚴令查明制止、並飭拒絕承做日用必需品之最長期押款、以免助長投機、影響民生、銀行職員應恪守行規、銀行本身、應以身作則、以杜流弊、</p>

<h3>兩租界內　義僑安居如常</h3>
<p>據大光社記者向義國郵船公司探悉、康鐵佛田號、自奉令停駛泊滬後、近有改爲水上飯店之議、惟因移泊妥當之碼頭、尚未定奪、故上項改闢飯店工作、迄未進行、又本埠義國僑民爲數不多、總計僅六百五十餘人、分居於兩租界內、並無不安狀態、義領署方面、雖曾通告僑民、檢束行動、以免與英法僑民發生誤會、兩租界當局對義僑、亦仍予保護、故義僑照常繼續居住、感情亦極融洽、故目前遷居輪上、事實亦非必要、</p>
<h3>貿易委會易貨辦法　對錢信譽昭著　美國表示信任提議繼續貸款　滙豐銀行年會稱爲經濟進步</h3>

<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>關於第五縱隊</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>「第五縱隊」，「第五縱隊」，全世界的人士都被這個新名詞震慄着，不論是歐洲，亞洲，美洲，不論是歐戰的交戰國或是非交戰國裏，都潛伏着這新型的間諜軍，英，法，土等國，爲了防止牠的暗躍，逮捕了不少國民與非國民，即是遠隔重洋的美國，也已感到牠的恐怖，而撥用十七萬五千美金，作爲搜查第五縱隊之經費了。</p>
<p>遠在五年前，一九三六年西班牙革命叛軍兵進瑪德里的時候，弗朗哥大本營中的馬拉將軍會宣佈說：「我軍現有四縱隊兵力在瑪德里城外，而且還有第五縱隊潛伏市中，瑪德里將由他們之手從內部開放，所以首都必入吾軍之手無疑！」</p>
<p>這可說就是「第五縱隊」名詞的起源，此次歐戰期內，德國利用第五縱隊，攪亂敵方內部，搜集敵軍情報等等，都獲得莫大成功，這支隱然不可見的間諜軍，不僅使敵人手足無措，同時也似乎妨碍了世人的安眠；然而所謂第五縱隊，究竟是甚麼樣子的組織呢？簡言之，第五縱隊就是德國爲這次歐戰而訓練的最優秀的間諜軍，牠當然是山秘密警察長官希姆萊所統轄的，人數幾萬，自屬不得而知，他們都得服從鐵一般的規律而接受本部的指令，隨機應變以期獲得最大的效果，所以「生命」一事，是必需置於度外的，此中有男，有女，有老，有幼，總之，各由其出身與敎養的相異，而被分配幹着最適當的工作。</p>
<p>舉一個例吧，當去年德國侵波時，九月八日，波蘭要衝羅府市被大隊德機轟炸，其中一機被波擊落，飛行員二名被波蘭軍隊所俘虜，訊問之下，二人都是極年靑的士官。這二名在前年都以學生的資格滯留在羅府市，而且該二名所屬的隊長亦是居住羅府頗久從事商業的。</p>
<p>又如在侵荷時，這批第五縱隊人員預先破壞運河，橋樑，以妨碍荷軍的軍事行動，在敵人的汽油貯藏處，飛機塲，造船所，縱火，散佈流言，攪亂人心等等，都是他們作戰的方法。</p>
<p>第五縱隊內不僅是德國人，同時還有許多有力的親德外人存在着，由於他們的力量，再組成更强大的組織，像細胞似的分散在國內活動着，德奥合併之成功，就是一個最好的例子。縱使未曾參戰的國家內，第五縱隊的活動，也是異常猛烈，羅馬尼亞的鐵衛團隱然與羅王對敵，先是暗殺首相加利南士哥，再策動與國王對立，最近，羅王終於軟化，不得不請求與該團妥協了。</p>
<p>德軍在這次戰爭中，曾極力對法宣傳說德國祇恨英國，沒有對法戰門的理由，可是第五縱隊在法國國內的活躍，實在非常利害。某决勒幼侖大總統在極秘密中視察阿爾薩斯戰錢，前面德軍陣地中立刻扯起「歡迎法國大總統閣下」的旗幟，而且德軍的播聲機又奏出「馬賽曲」來了。比這事件更爲有味的是當英首相邱吉爾和艾登二氏視察法軍中，在利爾市午餐，這當然是一件十分秘密的事了，可是當兩位就座的時候，恰巧桌上的無錢電也響了</p>
<p>「這裏是柏林的播音臺，現在法國爲了邱吉爾，艾登兩位大臣在利兩市舉行午餐會，其中的菜單讓我一一奉告吧……」</p>
<p>接着用極流利的英語將兩位大臣目前的菜單正確地報告出來，沒有一個錯誤，在法國境內不論事之大小，德國均好似一目瞭然，所以難攻不落的馬奇諾防綫，無怪也要被德國突破了。</p>
<p>第五縱隊簡直是無孔不入無計不施，祗要人們想得到的，牠已經做了，如今法國已經降服，這支新型的「間諜軍」，當踰越一切障碍，向着英吉利和巴爾幹諸國進攻的吧！</p>
<h3>事實勝雄辯</h3>
<p>— 林中豪</p>
<p>科學的進步，交通路綫的開展，商業的繁盛，已經使世界各國發生了無法分離的錯綜複雜的關係了。因此一個國家要採取一種孤立超然的態度，而想與世界脫離關係，不受世事的影響，這是不可能的。</p>
<p>當中日戰事爆發之初，各國外人士除了對於中國抗戰的決心與毅力表示非常的欽佩與讚嘆之外，有許多人對於「中國爲世界的安全而戰」這一句話，半信半疑，有人甚至以爲這純然是中國要求外力援助的一句宣傳標語。</p>
<p>可是，歐洲戰事爆發以後，事實終於勝雄辯了。英法聯軍着着失利，法國甚至屈辱求和，對於遠東，差不多無暇兼顧了。如果沒有中國在這裏繼續央勇抗戰，英法在遠東的勢力，將受到如何的摧殘與打擊，實在是無人敢逆料的。</p>
<p>「中國爲世界而戰！」這並不是誇大之言，而是千眞萬確的事實！</p>
<p>事實是勝於雄辯的！</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>這樣才是人</h3>
<p>— Mead著　苦口譯</p>
<p>尊敬我的國家，我的職業，以及我自己。以誠實與公正對待我的朋及，一如我所望於他們的以誠實與公正待我。做一個忠實的國民，要稱頌我的國家，一行一動，母使有傷其令譽，做一個姓名所至聲望隨之的人。</p>
<p>要把報酬的希望建築在服務的基礎之上。以老老實實的努力換取成功。要常工作是一種機會，高興的把牠捉住，盡量的把牠利用；不要把牠當作一種痛苦的勉強忍受的　役</p>
<p>要記牢成功在於我自己，在我自己的腦力，在我自己的志回，在我自己的勇氣與決心。期遇困難，與之奮鬥。將困苦艱難的經騐作爲將來作事的資料。</p>
<p>要虔信我的職業。要使所見之人，個個樂觀。以快樂驅散怒氣，以確信消除疑盧，以和易的個性减少與人的摩擦。</p>
<p>細心研究我的事業。詳細知道我的職業的各方面。要腦與力並用，工作要有系統，要有方法。有空暇便做必須做的事情，不要便光陰虛度。要節的時間如守財奴之節約金錢。要使每一小時滋生利息，學問的增進或身心的修養。</p>
<p>要使我的將來不爲債欠所累。要賺錢也要積錢。非至我力所能及，斷絕一切費錢的娛樂。摒棄淫佚，保持身體的康健與心神的安寗，猶如貿易中之保持貴重存貨。</p>
<p>最後，要緊握人生的歡樂。光明正大的做個堂堂丈夫。戰勝我自己的弱點，努力成一個有力的上人。</p>
<p>是則可以有禮於人，忠誠於友，無愧於天矣。</p>

<h3>昆明影業鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>（昆明航信）一年前的夏天，我到達了昆明，好比走進一片沙漠。朋友們見了面，爲精神上找消遣的方法，不外乎下盤棋，或是碰碰手氣，逢塲作戲，雀戰消遣。</p>
<p>這和美國開發西部的情形一樣，如今，這都市便一天一天的繁榮起來了！在昆明市的南區，許多美麗的大厦中，產生了一座巨型的劇塲，就是南屏大戲院了。它適應一切合理的要求，翁有古典與近代的美，嚴肅而富麗，而且更可貴的，放映機器是一架「孔雀牌」自動式完備的儀器，對於一部鉅片，是細膩而正確地顯不給觀衆；直到現在爲止，已經介紹一部第一流的鉅製給昆明的人仕了。這就是：</p>
<p>銀翼春秋（派拉蒙）。壽頭壽腦（米高梅）。新金山（聯美）。雙槍虎將（華納）。苦樂鴛鴦（聯美）。普格喬（蘇聯）。芙蓉仙子（聯美）。我若爲王（派拉蒙）。小伯爵（聯美）。魂歸離恨天（聯美）。</p>
<p>在本年四月二日誕生的那一天，同南屏大戲院遙遙相對的，正在建築着一座樂府，便是新大逸樂電影院的雛型，她是以投資三十萬元的條件之下建立起來的，因爲她的股東就是南屏戲院股東的一部。在昆明的影業中，牠們是姊妹戲院。而姊妹之外，還有一對老兄弟，叫大衆電影院與舊大逸樂戲院，設備的完美與選片的嚴格都談不上，他們營業的方針是使觀衆化低廉的代　來娛樂，這也許是這裏特有的，在放映時有職員在臺上講述劇中的情　對白。昆明的觀衆大都以爲解釋劇情可以增加看戲的興致。</p>
<p>關於國片在這裏映放的次數很少。——神秘之花，孤島天堂，北戰塲精忠錄如曇花的一現。最近中電方面把「長空萬里」的外景在昆明攝製，還帶來許多優秀的演員，使大家對國片注意起來。我很希望上海的影業公司在昆明合組一個聯合辦事處，把國片儘量介紹給內地的觀衆。</p>
<p>昆明電影事業的發展，證明這都市在進步，至少已不是一片沙漠了！（六月十五日寄）</p>
<h3>話劇蘇武牧羊</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>聯藝實騐劇團聽說楚新興的職業劇團，是一些有志的靑年組織的，甚爲可敬。此次演王即絮的創作「蘇武牧羊」還是第一次的公演呢。</p>
<p>此劇多合於史實，即蘇武之子通國亦爲正史所有。漢書卷五十四蘇建子武傳云：「武年老，子前坐摹死，上閔之；問左右武在匈奴，豈有子乎？武因平恩侯自白，前發匈奴時胡婦適產一子通國，有聲問來，願因使者致金帛贖之，上許焉。後通國隨使者至，上以爲郞。只是不會提起胡婦是否一同回國。貝加爾湖即白哈兒湖，史記註云：「北海爲匈奴北界，今爲白哈兒湖。」</p>
<p>郭沫若會經寫了幾首「電火光中，」其中有一首詩便是蘇武牧羊。現在這話劇也是一首美麗的長詩，因了胡旭光凌雷等的設計，吳永剛等的導演，使得每一幕都有不少美麗的畫面，人物所站立的位置亦極美觀。雖然只是一幅白布覆在山上，兩隻眞的羊繫在欄上，却極像冰天雪地；服裝也與平劇崑曲完全不同，純粹是漢代衣冠，我認爲馬連良也不妨參考一下的。演員方面，自以鐵諾的蘇武爲最成功。小淸的通國亦極可愛，惟投降的降字應讀平聲，錯讀了去聲</p>
<p>像這樣冷靜的題材，居然能够演得主動活潑，自始至終，觀衆不感疲倦，可說是出乎意料之外的成功。</p>
<p>通國在沙地上認字，蘇武回國前把風帽賜給他的兒子，這些都是極有詩意的。劇中寫蘇武常惠的忠烈，與衛律張勝等對照，自是此劇的主旨所在，這一點的成功，已經由連日賣座的盛况證實了</p>

<h3>「天羅地網」觀感</h3>
<p>— 沈琪</p>
<p>「天羅地網」的演出，雖是含有一種「因果」報應的說敎意義，但却有力地强調一種心理的懲罰，諷譏一般崩潰層間不規則的人生者。</p>
<p>檢討「天羅地網」一劇，故事的進展十分簡單，說明一個人在犯罪後，等於欠下社會的債。即使緩期，甚至避過，最後還是要償還的。全劇結構緊張刺激，在五幕十一段中，湧伏着許多高潮。第二幕的馬余川　殺梅傑英，以及第四幕的納如出走，阿南自殺等等，都能壓制着觀衆的情緒。諷刺力也很强大。</p>
<p>至於演出，周芻的馬金川，全劇最是吃重也最是成功者，愛與憎的內心衝突，給充分發揮着的，尤其能够在舉動中間，始終增强恐怖的塲面，音調語氣也够　出一個種、病　　　　　　　　　　　　　　和輕浮的兩方面個性，還合身份。阿南在劇中，是一個誠懇樸實的具有賢妻良母型。張雪梅演來，很能傳神。仇銓的海蒙，藍靑的格蘭太太，都非常稱職，借着流利的白口來襯托着神情。其餘黃河的梅傑英，邵華的醫生，出塲雖少，劇藝上却是努力了的。</p>
<p>最後，全劇在我觀後，感到我們不必恨人，更不必恨犯罪的人，恨的是社會制度，同時更該努力改革舊的制度，創造新的世界！</p>
<h3>觀「楊排風」後感賦</h3>
<p>— 鹿原學人</p>
<p>世善此次在更新演「楊排風」（原名演火棍）一劇，已五六次之多，每演必滿座，可知其號召能力，余於前晚始得抽暇一觀，全劇斟酌飽滿，無懈可擊，洵屬佳構，令譽之來，絕非倖致。總之世善之藝術，可以矯健穩練四字賅之，至其姿勢之優美，號態之輕盈，所謂翩若驚鴻，矯若游龍者，尤其餘事也。</p>
<p>按此劇應簡稱爲四打，戲劇中之三顧三搜三斬等，不乏其例，况又有三打一劇在前，（姚剛打王英）更不妨以四打名之也。觀後賦詩兩首：</p>
<p>靑龍打後打焦孟，對內功成抗外邦；燒火丫頭多戰績，更看臨陣打韓昌。</p>
<p>但見手如輪轉旋，當頭棒喝若揮鞭；胡兒强悍終無用，屈膝神州女傑前。</p>
<h3>兩劇壇之新陣容（下）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>丑角慈瑞泉，爲丑角前輩，亦今日梨園中之典型人物也，歷與譚氏祖孫一代配戲，其資格經騐名譽地位，與蕭長華髣髴：因年事關係，久未　來，（老慈爲程硯秋譚富英兩班中之基本人物，但歷屆硯秋南來，老慈皆未隨仃，而由其子少泉庖代，即富英前次來滬，亦因老慈之不願飽受舟中之苦，而改邀茹富蕙也）。此次毅然南下，吾人得能一見前輩典型，可謂眼福不淺。（一說老慈仍不願南來，譚劇團之當家丑角，或仍爲茹富蕙云）。尚有一羅文奎亦北方名丑，滬人諒不大熟知，有加以介紹之必要：此人係老伶工羅百歲之猶子，家學淵源，藝頗不凡，惜懷少不遇，近年來在平以敎　且爲業，未嘗搭班，頗不得志，此次能爲富英邀來，可謂千里馬之遇伯樂矣。武行張連廷，係楊盛春所邀之下手，按盛春之下手原係韓盛信，者番盛春南來不邀盛信，而邀連廷，（按張連廷爲高盛麟之下手）亦怪事也。花旦計硯芬，原名小桂花，爲斌慶社之弟子，與現在更新之谷玉蘭爲師兄弟，（按谷玉蘭原名玉蘭花）早年曾紅極一時，今則已年老色衰，裏子老生哈寳山，爲後起之秀，其藝殊不亞於前輩之張春彥，亦富央之老搭擋也。宋繼亭亦有可取。綜觀此次富英所邀之配角，要能稱得「人才濟濟」四字。更可一述者，即此中之配角，多爲譚門內親，如楊盛春爲富英之妹倩，姜妙香爲當英之泰山，譚世英爲富英之胞弟，宋繼亭爲富英之內兄等，（富英前妻氏宋）此亦可謂內舉不避親，其演出常更盡如火如荼之妙矣，一笑。</p>
<p>最後消息：關於更新舞台所邀之譚劇團，人事方面、略有更動，花臉馬連昆因公事問題，並未談妥，已中止南來。老伶工慈瑞泉決隨譚同行，此外尚有一事不出記者所料，即武生揚盛春之下靶韓盛信，決隨盛春同來，而張連廷亦在被邀之列。又悉譚富英將來滬演「四郎探母」一戲，譚劇團復邀得老旦何盛淸（富連成四科得老旦人才二人，一爲李盛泉一爲何盛淸）加入如虎添翼，更新此批人馬實力乃益見雄厚矣</p>

<h3>Negotiations Held Near Rome; Italy Proposes Armistice Terms; Franco-German Armistice Agreement Announced Yesterday; Stipulates That French Forces Must Be Disarmed Immediately</h3>
<p>Rome – Last night, after the initial meeting between the French armistice delegation and the Italian delegation, it was learned that Italy's armistice terms would be communicated to the Bordeaux government via telephone. This morning, the representatives from both sides did not convene, and the time for the final decision meeting has not yet been announced. Last night's meeting took place in the village of Inzisa, 19 kilometers from Rome. The Italian delegation arrived two minutes before the French delegation. Foreign Minister Ciano was accompanied by the Director of Protocol, Celesia, and others. The Italian representatives were all in military uniform and saluted in the Roman style to signal their respect when they saw the French representatives arriving. The French representatives sat opposite the Italian representatives. After taking their seats, Ciano stood up and stated that General Badoglio intended to convey the armistice terms to the French representatives. Badoglio rose and asked General Roatta to read the armistice terms. After Roatta finished reading, French General Huntziger declared that the French representatives had learned of the armistice terms proposed by Italy and intended to report them to the French government before announcing France's decision. The negotiations then adjourned, and the French representatives returned to their quarters by car. Ciano immediately went to the Palazzo Venezia to report the proceedings to the Prime Minister. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome – At noon today, the French armistice delegation spoke with Bordeaux and consulted on matters. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux – Interior Minister Sérol announced to the press at 10:30 this morning that the French delegation was still continuing negotiations with the Italian authorities in Rome and would notify the government of the progress via telephone at any time. It is expected that the negotiations between the two sides may conclude today. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>London – A diplomatic correspondent for the United Press International recently stated that the French side had proposed amendments to certain points regarding the armistice terms proposed by Germany. Some of these were immediately accepted by Germany, but there were no major changes overall. (Havas Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>London – German radio announced that railway traffic between Berlin and Paris would be restored within two days. (Reuters Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Geneva – Italian sources claim that Italy and Germany have agreed to the following three points: (1) Italian troops will occupy the entire Mediterranean coast of France; (2) German troops must not extend into the area east of Chambéry and Grenoble (previous reports have confirmed that German troops are no longer active in the Lyon region); (3) An Italian prince will establish sovereignty in a semi-independent state including Nice, Savoy, and part of Dauphiné, with borders starting from Dauphiné, passing through Avenue Napoléon, Grenoble, Digne, and Riviera. (Reuters Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German Admiral Raeder inspected naval bases built by Germans in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the northern coast of France between June 17th and 21st, and inspected fleets in each location in preparation for action against Britain. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux – Sources have issued news stating that German troops have already reached the cities of Royan and Saintes, north of the port of Bordeaux. Well-informed sources here recently said that German leader Hitler replied to Prime Minister Pétain, saying that the German army would not enter the port of Bordeaux as long as Franco-Italian armistice negotiations were underway. (Havas Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>Content of the Franco-German Armistice Agreement</p>
<p>London – The following is a summary of the full text of the armistice terms proposed by the German government to the French government:</p>
<p>Article 1: Hostilities cease immediately. French troops that have been encircled shall lay down their arms.</p>
<p>Article 2: For the sake of German security interests, the area north and west of the following line shall be occupied by Germany: from Geneva via Dôle, Chalon-sur-Saône, Paray-le-Monial, Moulins, Bourges, Vierzon to 20 kilometers east of Tours, then turning south and running parallel to the Angoulême railway to Mont-de-Marsan and joining Charente-Maritime and Basses-Pyrénées. Any area within this territory that has not yet been occupied by German troops shall be occupied by German troops upon the signing of this treaty.</p>
<p>Article 3: Germany shall have all rights of occupation within the occupied territories, except for local administration. The French government must provide all necessary facilities. Germany will reduce the occupation of the French west coast to a minimum after the end of the war against Britain. The French government is free to choose the location of its government within the unoccupied territory or return to Paris. If it returns to Paris, Germany will provide the necessary facilities for administration from Paris to both the occupied and unoccupied territories.</p>
<p>Article 4: Except for the troops necessary to maintain order, the French army, navy, and air force shall be disbanded and disarmed within a period to be determined in the future. The number and armament of the troops retained to maintain order shall be determined by Germany and Italy. Armed French troops in the occupied territories must move to the unoccupied territories and be disbanded. These troops will consist of soldiers who have already laid down their arms in their garrisons at the time of the armistice.</p>
<p>Article 5: As collateral, Germany may require France to surrender, in good condition, all its heavy artillery, tanks, anti-tank guns, military aircraft, infantry weapons, tractors, and ammunition in the unoccupied territories. The scope of these surrendered weapons shall be determined by Germany.</p>
<p>Article 6: All weapons and war equipment remaining in the unoccupied territories, except those for the use of authorized French forces, must be stored under German and Italian management. Factories in the unoccupied territories manufacturing new war equipment must cease production immediately.</p>
<p>Article 7: Land and coastal defenses equipped with military equipment in the occupied territories must be handed over in good condition. All maps of aircraft emplacements, fortresses, and mines, as well as barracks, must be handed over.</p>
<p>Article 8: The French fleet, except for those retained to protect the interests of its colonies, must assemble at ports to be designated in the future and be disarmed under German and Italian supervision. The German government solemnly declares that Germany has no intention of using the French fleet stationed in German-controlled ports for its own purposes during the war, except for warships necessary for coastal defense and mine sweeping. All warships outside French territorial waters, except for a portion of the fleet to be designated in the future to protect colonial interests, must be recalled to France.</p>
<p>Article 9: All information regarding naval mines and defenses must be provided by France, and mine sweeping operations shall be carried out by French warships.</p>
<p>Article 10: All equipment, military supplies, and stored items in the occupied territories must be handed over intact. Fortresses, permanent fortifications, and naval shipyards must be preserved in their original condition and must not be damaged. The same applies to all transportation facilities, especially railways, roads, canals, telephones, telegraphs, and navigation aids and coastal lights. France must provide the materials needed for repairs.</p>
<p>Article 11: All radio transmitting and receiving equipment within French territory shall be shut down.</p>
<p>Article 12: The French government shall facilitate the transportation of goods between Germany and Italy through the unoccupied territories.</p>
<p>Article 13: The French government must send civilians back to the occupied territories.</p>
<p>Article 14: The French government must prevent the transfer of valuables and securities from the occupied territories to the unoccupied territories or overseas.</p>
<p>Article 15: The cost of maintaining German troops occupying French territory must be paid by France.</p>
<p>Article 16: German prisoners of war shall be released. The French government must hand over German nationals designated by the German government who are now in France or its overseas territories.</p>
<p>Article 17: French prisoners of war now in German hands shall remain in detention until the establishment of peace.</p>
<p>Article 18: Measures to guarantee the delivery of surrendered materials shall be stipulated separately.</p>
<p>Article 19: The German Armistice Commission will handle armistice matters in coordination with the Franco-Italian armistice treaty.</p>
<p>Article 20: This armistice treaty shall take effect only after the French government and the Italian government have concluded a similar treaty. Hostile acts shall cease six hours after the Italian government announces the establishment of this treaty. The German government will announce the armistice by radio.</p>
<p>Article 21: This armistice treaty shall remain in effect until the establishment of a peace treaty. Germany may terminate it at any time if the French government fails to fulfill its obligations. (Reuters Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>German Loudspeaker Vehicles Tour Paris; Citizens Remain Calm</p>
<p>Paris – On the evening of the 22nd, German loudspeaker vehicles broadcast messages in the streets of Paris, stating that the French armistice agreement had been signed in Compiègne and that hostilities within France would cease six hours after the Franco-Italian armistice agreement was signed. The residents of Paris remained extremely calm after hearing the news. The situation is expected to gradually stabilize. Many cafes have reopened, and thousands of people are sitting in cafes, discussing current events. Everyone is satisfied with the end of the war and can now return to normal life. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>French Commander in Syria Declares Continued Resistance</p>
<p>London – Responsible sources here recently stated that although Franco-German armistice negotiations have been concluded, authorities in French territories are still extremely agitated. Among them, General Mittelhauser, commander of French forces in the French mandate of Syria, has declared his determination to continue the resistance. Governor-General Catroux of Vietnam has also declared his unwillingness to surrender. In addition, authorities in Tunis, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, Djibouti, and other locations have all stated their determination to uphold the principles of the Allied powers with loyalty. The British government is therefore preparing to take all necessary financial measures to ensure that the French colonial empire can fulfill its responsibilities. Indeed, Britain's goal is to fully restore France proper and its overseas territories, as declared by Prime Minister Churchill. (Havas Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>London – The French High Commissioner in Syria recently broadcast on Radio Beirut that General Mittelhauser, commander-in-chief of French forces in Syria, has decided to carry out France's mission in Syria and to defend France's honor and its flag there with invincible perseverance. The High Commissioner also stated that his views were completely in line with those of General Mittelhauser. (Reuters Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Hanover – British aircraft bombed Bückeburg yesterday. This is the location where Germany holds its annual Harvest Festival. Although many bombs were dropped, the damage was minimal. Some incendiary bombs fell into the water. Bückeburg has no military significance, and there are no military targets within several miles of it. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>German and Italian War Reports</p>
<p>Berlin – German military experts, in a conversation with a reporter from Haitong News Agency, added details to the German war report, stating that after the end of the battles in Alsace and Lorraine, the Franco-German war had effectively ended. The French government requested an armistice when the French army had completely collapsed. The French government requested an armistice after the French army was defeated by the German army on the front lines. Defeat was the cause, and the armistice was the result. This must be remembered so that future history books do not reverse cause and effect. The German army captured 500,000 French soldiers in the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, including three army commanders and many generals. The amount of military supplies and provisions captured is almost impossible to estimate. There are still small-scale battles along the Maginot Line in the areas of Sarre-Union, Haguenau, and the Vosges, but these are unrelated to the overall situation and can be cleared up in a short period of time. German forces along the Atlantic coast continue to advance south of the Loire River. Mobile units have approached the naval port of La Rochelle. German forces have also occupied the naval port of Nantes and captured 40 tanks already loaded onto ships. The French air force north of Bordeaux has been completely annihilated. German aircraft have been very successful in bombing merchant ships and transport ships along the Atlantic coast between Nantes and the Gironde. German forces are advancing south from Lyon, crossing the Rhône River in the foothills of the Savoy Alps south of Geneva. Mountain warfare is very difficult. The air force cannot easily assist the army, and tanks and motorized units also have difficulty maneuvering. However, the German army has gained experience in mountain warfare during the Norwegian campaign. However, the French forces in this area are all well-trained units prepared for mountain warfare. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters – This afternoon, the German military report stated that the following areas on the French Atlantic coast have been occupied by German forces: south to the mouth of the Gironde River, La Rochelle, and Rochefort. German forces captured a large amount of military supplies and occupied a large-scale artillery factory. Within Alsace-Lorraine, several isolated units surrendered. Several more fortifications of the Maginot Line have been occupied by German forces. Southeast of Lyon, German forces broke through enemy resistance and are now advancing towards Grenoble and Chambéry. Last night, several German fast boats sank two armed British ships with torpedoes, one with a displacement of 3,500 tons and one with a displacement of 5,000 tons. A submarine claims to have sunk no less than 22,500 tons of enemy cargo. Last night, the German Air Force only flew reconnaissance missions over the North Sea. German fighter planes shot down two British fighter planes near Calais. Nine British fighter planes attempted to fly over Dutch territory yesterday afternoon, and six were shot down by German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. Two or three British fighter planes, using thick clouds as cover, invaded the German town of Damme in Holstein, dropping several bombs and strafing residents with machine guns, seriously injuring two people and slightly injuring four people. Several bombs also hit the prisoner-of-war camp on the coast near Borkum, injuring and killing several French people. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian military headquarters issued a war report today stating that on June 21, our forces along the Alpine front began attacking enemy positions, occupying the Cheneil fort and many important strongholds near Briançon. Our forces also broke through the Isère, Arc, Var, and Vésubie positions in the Alpine valleys, and the enemy is now under attack from both front and rear. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Various Aspects After the French Armistice</h3>
<p>The contents of the Franco-German armistice agreement were only disclosed yesterday and reached Shanghai. This is the most timely topic for today's newspaper. It should start from the agreement and discuss everything. Not only should reporters do this, but readers also expect it.</p>
<p>Exceptionally, the reporter begs the readers for forgiveness. Although the current topic cannot be abandoned, this commentary has no conclusion. Not only is there no conclusion. According to the general mission of commentary, or what is called representing public opinion, newspapers should express the views in the hearts of readers on current issues on their behalf. Or what is called guiding public opinion, newspapers should provide a kind of view for readers who are doubtful and confused about the problem, for readers to agree with and adopt. The reporter originally did not dare to claim to be able to represent or guide. And today's discussion of the Franco-German armistice agreement, not only does not want to represent or guide, but is afraid that the result of the discussion will only increase the readers' frustration.</p>
<p>Frustration is unavoidable, because fundamentally this is a frustrating problem, a problem of the whole world.</p>
<p>The content of the Franco-German armistice agreement, according to Reuters London telegraphic report from the British side, which is also not the official report of the United States, totals 21 articles. The articles are as published in today's news column, and there is no time to annotate and explain them one by one. Readers who carefully read the articles of the agreement will be able to understand what the future survival state of the French nation and the French people under such clauses will be like.</p>
<p>But please pay attention to the reader: First, these are the conditions of Germany to France, and do not include the conditions of Italy to France; therefore, in the part remaining of the French nation in this Franco-German agreement, the conditions of Italy must also be removed, and this is the "net residue" after the armistice. Second, this is only an armistice agreement, which is a transitional condition from the armistice to the complete end of the future war situation, that is, a temporary measure, and not a peace treaty between Germany and France that has a permanent nature in law. Third, the future peace treaty is another article, and the peace treaty may be stricter to varying degrees than the armistice agreement due to various factors; it may also be more lenient to varying degrees than the armistice agreement due to various factors; and it may even make the armistice agreement like a blank sheet of paper due to various factors. All sorts of things are possible and completely unknown. Up to now, we should only clearly recognize the essence of this armistice agreement. As for what the future holds and what the consequences will be, please reserve it in frustration.</p>
<p>The Franco-German armistice is such an agreement, regardless of the future or the consequences, but only discuss the reactions that we already know at present: First, Britain, an allied country that has the same friendship with France and fights side by side, declares that it does not recognize the organization that accepts this armistice agreement as the French government; second, apart from the French government presided over by President Lebrun and General Pétain, that is, the government denied by its allied country, there will be a so-called "French Provisional National Committee", which Britain will recognize as the representative organization of the Allied powers: Third, some French colonies and dependencies and some overseas French nationals have successively declared that they will join hands with Britain and continue to fight; fourth, some French warships have already joined the British navy and continue to fight. These four items are the obvious reactions after the French side accepted the armistice agreement, and can generally be regarded as news based on facts.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious reactions and factual news, we don't need to add some imagination to think about how other aspects will develop. But in terms of factual reaction, there are also corresponding current doubts: First, of the various provisions stipulated by the French government accepting the armistice agreement, quite a few items cannot be effectively implemented with an order, so will the part that cannot be implemented cause difficulties beyond the agreement on the German side. Second, the French government accepting the armistice agreement, on the one hand, is already under the mighty power of the victorious country, and on the other hand, it is spurned by its allied country Britain, so in terms of psychology and action, emotion and fact, everything about Germany and Britain immediately encounters the fork in the road of friend or foe, how will it choose to obey or violate. Third, Germany and Britain are absolute opposites. From these two sides, in any corner of the international community, they have implicitly or explicitly become two opposing routes. For these two routes, we can no longer carve a mark on the boat to seek the sword, thinking that there is a unified whole French national policy and attitude that can be regarded as their criteria and sought after; then, what will we, or any non-French person, take as a criterion for everything about the French nation in the international community. In short, generally speaking, with its internal divisions and external complexities, divided by and multiplied by each other, gains and losses, all kinds of completely different possibilities are presented at the same time. All contradictions cannot be weighed. The word "subtle" is not enough to describe its subtlety. The reporter never dares to act as an interpreter and conclude it. To try to conclude, just observe the further evolution of various aspects.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Assists in Combat; Bombs Dropped Over Yichang; Battle Unfolds in Western Suburbs of Dangyang; Japanese Troops Driven into Plains</h3>
<p>A certain location – In order to assist the army in annihilating the remnants of the Japanese troops besieged near Yichang, our heroic air force, led by Team Leader ××× and Captain ××× of the ××× Squadron, flew ×× aircraft carrying ×× tons of bombs towards Yichang despite the adverse weather on the 23rd. The first large formation reached the skies over Yichang at 1:00 PM and bombed the Japanese positions at Dongshan Temple, achieving great battle results. At the same time, the second large formation bombed the remnants of the Japanese troops routed by our forces on Wangbujing Mountain and the Japanese mechanized units concentrated along the highway east of the city, immediately setting more than ten fires on both sides of the highway. After completing their mission, our aircraft safely returned to base. (Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>A certain location in Western Hubei – Our army in western Hubei has driven the main force of the Japanese army into the plains along the Hanyi Road and is now intensifying efforts to narrow the encirclement. On the 20th, a unit of our army pursued the Japanese army fiercely from the area west of Dangyang to near Herongpu and attacked the Japanese army entrenched in Dangyang. (Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>A certain location in Eastern Hubei – On the 17th, our army suddenly attacked the area between Guanqiao and Yangjialin, defeating the Japanese army there. The Japanese army from Wuxue sent reinforcements, but our forces met them and killed many Japanese soldiers. Fierce fighting is still ongoing near Shifosi. (Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The battle for the highlands in the western suburbs of Dangyang has unfolded fiercely. Liyuzhai and Jiajiadi are the focus of the struggle. On the 22nd, the Japanese army added many mountain guns and counterattacked our forces, but were repulsed. On the same day, our forces attacked Doushanpo and gained much success, regaining several hilltops. In the Yichang area, our forces captured Taihechang and pushed the Japanese into a narrow area. The Japanese suffered many casualties in western Hubei this time. In recent days, there have been five or six thousand wounded soldiers transported from Jingmen to Shayang. (Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>Yidu – The Japanese army in the Jingsha-Dangyi area has been severely battered by our forces in recent days, suffering heavy losses. For the past two days, they have retreated into their fortifications and remained entrenched, refusing to come out. (Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Zaoyang – Our forces continue to achieve battle results in the Dabie Mountains: (1) The Japanese invading Chaoyangdian suffered heavy casualties after being encircled and annihilated by our forces. The Japanese troops invading Pailouling were severely mauled by our forces on the 17th, and most have been eliminated. A small number fled towards Gufogefang. (2) The Japanese harassing Baiyangling, Gandongjian, and other locations were met by our forces in separate engagements. In the fierce fighting until noon on the 17th, countless Japanese soldiers were killed. (3) On the 19th, our army launched a four-pronged attack on the Japanese entrenched in Doushan, and the remnants of the Japanese army scattered and fled. (Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Invade Chongqing, Bombing the Consulate Area; British Consulate-General Completely Destroyed; French Consulate Buildings Also Hit</h3>
<p>Chongqing – On the 24th, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, dropping dozens of bombs in the urban area. The entire building of the British Consulate-General was destroyed. The British Embassy and the French Consulate-General also suffered bomb hits within their compounds, and the buildings were severely shaken. A certain Counselor of the American Embassy told reporters that the Japanese planes concentrated their bombing on the British and French consulate area today. To say that it was unintentional is truly an untenable argument. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – One hundred and fifteen Japanese planes, on the 24th, attacked the temporary capital in four waves. The Chinese Air Force fiercely intercepted them, and many Japanese planes were hit and damaged, fleeing eastward. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – On the 24th, one hundred and fifteen Japanese planes attacked Sichuan in four waves, dropping more than four hundred bombs in Jiangbei and Chongqing City one after another. Chinese casualties were very few. Only about fifty houses were destroyed or collapsed. Several fires broke out, but they were quickly extinguished by the fire brigade and did not spread. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Fifty-four Japanese planes bombed the lower city and western suburbs of Chongqing this afternoon. A fire broke out in the lower city due to the bombing, but most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes in the western suburbs landed in the mountains on the north bank of the Jialing River. The Japanese planes were subjected to intense bombardment by the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. Chinese fighters also took to the air to intercept them. Japanese planes scattered leaflets in the city air, urging the Chinese people to stop resisting. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – This afternoon, when fifty-four Japanese planes bombed the lower city and western suburbs of Chongqing, the residences of the British diplomatic mission and the British and French consulates were all hit. The buildings of the British and French consulates were destroyed. A bomb hit the residences of the British diplomatic mission, penetrating the roof but not detonating. The roofs of all the buildings were painted with the British and French flags, clearly visible. The main building of the British consulate was currently occupied by officials from the British Consulate-General and the British diplomatic mission. It was hit by three bombs, each weighing five hundred pounds, and completely destroyed. Reuters learned that all the officials were safe. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Today, one hundred and twenty-six Japanese planes flew over this area, carrying out their work of slaughter and destruction. As bombs rained down, the British and French consulates, Catholic hospitals, and Chinese municipal hospitals were instantly destroyed. The Japanese planes also scattered leaflets, saying that they would completely destroy Chongqing. The British Embassy office, opposite the British Consulate, was also damaged, with shattered windows and a collapsed roof. The wooden sign in front of the office, marked "British Embassy Office," was also bombed away, leaving only fragments. According to the guards in front of the gate, there was still an unexploded bomb inside the embassy. If that bomb explodes, the British Embassy will also be reduced to ashes. The Japanese planes dropped no fewer than hundreds of incendiary and explosive bombs. Chinese casualties were at least two hundred people, and at least a thousand civilian houses were destroyed. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes scattered small booklets with colored paper in the city, printed in both Chinese and Japanese, demanding a cessation of resistance and threatening complete destruction of Chongqing with cruel bombing. Chongqing issued an air raid alert at noon, which lasted for four and a half hours. The British and French consulates were bombed at 2:40 PM. Six coolies were killed by bombs in the open space at the entrance of the French Consulate. Although no foreigners were killed or injured, the personnel and residents in the British Consulate almost met with disaster. They first went to the roof to watch the air raid, but when they saw Japanese planes flying over the consulate, they hurriedly retreated. Just as they reached the basement, the consulate was destroyed. Since the German Consulate was bombed on May 4th of last year, only the British and French consulates remained in Chongqing. A total of twenty-seven Japanese planes bombed the consulates, while other planes bombed elsewhere. Today, the Japanese planes dropped more explosive bombs than incendiary bombs, and the bombed area was even wider. Both the city and the suburbs suffered tragic disasters, and countless places in the vicinity were also affected. (24th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>General de Gaulle Announces the Organization of the French National Committee in England; Calls on Comrades to Continue Resistance and Maintain Independence; Hopes for Belgian Cooperation in Defending Freedom</h3>
<p>London – Former French Undersecretary of Defense General de Gaulle recently delivered a broadcast speech in French here, announcing the establishment of the "French National Committee," calling on comrades to continue fighting to maintain the independence of the motherland. He said, "The enemy's proposed armistice conditions have actually been accepted by our government. In this way, all our military equipment, airplanes, warships, and gold will be used to benefit the enemy. This kind of surrender directly makes France a complete slave of the enemy, and the Bordeaux government directly depends on the whims of Germany and Italy. What is the true will of the French people? There is currently no opportunity to express it. We have obtained the consent of the British government to establish the French National Committee to represent the interests of the motherland. All our countrymen who decide to continue fighting to maintain the independence of the motherland and fulfill their obligations, cooperating in the war until the Allied countries achieve a common victory, will also have their interests represented by the committee." The list of committee members will be announced soon. French military and political personnel who are already in British territory or are about to come will be commanded by the committee. Once a "independent and legitimate government of France is re-established," the committee will report its actions to it. In addition, Belgians are also expected to come forward and cooperate to defend their country's freedom. "In short, the war has not yet been defeated, the motherland has not yet been destroyed, and hope has not yet been extinguished. All my comrades, please rise up quickly. Long live France!"

<p>Britain Recalls Envoy to France, Does Not Recognize Bordeaux Government</p>
<p>London – Last night, London broadcast in French, saying that the British government found that the newly signed armistice conditions contradicted the treaties solemnly concluded with the Allied governments, placing the Bordeaux government in a state of complete submission to the enemy and depriving all free French citizens of their freedom and power to represent them. Therefore, the British government now announces that it can no longer recognize the Bordeaux government as the government of an independent country. The British government has noted the proposal to organize a temporary French National Committee to fully represent the independent French people who are determined to fight and uphold France's international obligations. The British government now announces that it will recognize this temporary National Committee and will discuss with the committee all matters related to the conduct of the war as long as the committee continues to represent the French people who are determined to fight the common enemy. Before the British government broadcast this announcement, General de Gaulle, the military tactical director of the former French Reynaud cabinet, broadcast from London, saying that he would negotiate with the British government to organize a temporary French National Committee to represent the interests of France, determined to maintain France's independence and the honor of its allies, and to contribute to the Allied war effort. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>London – It is reported that the British Ambassador to France, Sir Ronald Campbell, has led his staff to leave Bordeaux and return home. His departure from France is because France is now almost entirely ravaged by the German army, and his capture would inevitably cause many troubles, and not because of any severe changes in the relationship between the British and French governments. According to officials, the British government still recognizes Marshal Pétain's Bordeaux government. General de Gaulle, the military advisor to former French Prime Minister Reynaud, is now in London calling on many French territories and French citizens to continue the war. His actions have been fully supported by the British government. The number of French people around the world who responded is very large. Since he delivered his broadcast speech last night, telegrams from groups and individuals have poured in like snowflakes, all expressing their willingness to pledge allegiance to the motherland and continue the war. The French ambassador and his staff will remain in London to represent the French Republic. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>Bordeaux – After the Franco-German armistice was signed, Britain recalled its diplomatic representatives to the French government. It is reported that British Ambassador Campbell left Bordeaux with key members of the embassy and boarded a British destroyer.

However, the British ambassador remained in Bordeaux to report developments to the British government. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>Geneva – According to Bordeaux sources, after the German-French armistice agreement was signed, British Ambassador to France Campbell quietly left Bordeaux, thus severing British-French diplomatic relations.

<h3>French Government Issues Statement Refuting Churchill's Speech; Pétain Also Delivers Speech Responding to British Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Bordeaux – After British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech yesterday on the armistice agreement between France and Germany, the French government issued a statement protesting, stating, "It is the government's duty to bring Prime Minister Churchill's speech to the attention of the people, but at the same time, it must raise the most sincere protest against the content of the speech, because the British government has been closely watching the progress of the past war, so the British government is fully aware of all the factors that led the French government to cease fighting. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to condone Prime Minister Churchill's critical tone of France's armistice. Until now, Prime Minister Churchill has always expressed a friendly understanding of the current suffering needs, but yesterday's speech is very different. Our government has always strived to avoid adding the pain of the loss of the relationship between Britain and France to the current tragic torment. However, Prime Minister Churchill's speech yesterday contradicted this long-cherished wish. The British government obviously wants to distinguish between the French government and the will of the people. The French government hereby denies this, because the government believes that what it has done is for the sake of national interests and will surely be supported by the people of the whole country. For this reason, the French government should refute certain points of Prime Minister Churchill's speech, and it should immediately reject several points that have other intentions. In short, the French government has no other way to go except for the course it has now chosen, and the French public should be able to understand this." (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bordeaux – Premier Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address last night in response to British Prime Minister Churchill, saying, "Our government and people were depressed and shocked by Prime Minister Churchill's speech yesterday. We understand the suffering on the British side. In essence, it is that Prime Minister Churchill is deeply afraid that the misfortune that France has suffered in recent months will befall Britain. Although the situation is not yet at that point, we are not willing to remain silent about the lessons provided by foreign cabinet members. Prime Minister Churchill can only judge the interests of Britain, but he cannot judge the interests of our country, let alone the honor of our country. In fact, our national flag has never been stained, and our army has fought bravely everywhere to defend the motherland. It was only because of inferior military equipment and fewer personnel that we were forced to request an armistice. We have now done so with an independent and dignified attitude. In short, at this time of national crisis, the French people are united and will not be divided by anything." (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan to Change Foreign Policy Strategy</h3>

The Hochi Shimbun said that Japan must strengthen its relations with Germany and Italy, and Foreign Minister Arita's policy clearly has this tendency. However, it seems inevitable to encounter difficulties if Japan wants to clarify the relationship between Japan and the United States. However, even if Japan wants to improve its attitude towards the United States and the Soviet Union, it must still maintain good relations with Germany and Italy. The newspaper also predicted that there will be changes in the foreign service after the Japanese government adopts a diplomatic policy, which is also worth noting. (24th Haitong</p>

<h3>The Largest French Arsenal Falls into German Hands</h3>
<p>Kruse: Kloss, a war correspondent with the German army, recently described the situation at Kruse, the largest French arsenal. He stated, "As we entered the largest French arsenal through the main gate, the people there greeted us with nervous expressions. The factory has a history of over a hundred years, and its scale and production capacity are comparable to those of Krupp. It has branches throughout France, specializing in the manufacture of French military arms. Now, the city of Kruse has not been damaged by artillery fire, and its arsenal has completely fallen into German hands. The French army retreated early in the morning, and the city was immediately occupied by the German army. The French retreat was so hasty that very few machines in the factory were damaged. The German advance was indeed rapid, catching the enemy off guard at every turn. The factory has a large stock of steel plates. The armor plates for the Maginot Line and the steel plates for French battleships were all manufactured by this factory. In addition, it is capable of other productions. The workers stood and watched us, with a slight look of surprise. The factory has never stopped working. When the French army retreated, the factory did not stop production. There are approximately several thousand workers. There are unfinished gun barrels and machine guns for airplanes in the factory. The factory workers are proud that they were able to produce 400 cannons per month during the World War." (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<h3>The Final Act of the Compiègne Negotiations: French Representatives Sought Instructions from Bordeaux Before Signing</h3>
<p>Compiègne: The French delegation communicated with Bordeaux as the final act before signing the armistice agreement. According to eyewitnesses, the originally scheduled call was for two hours, but the time was eventually doubled. The technical staff of the French delegation repeatedly tried to connect with Bordeaux, but the telephone line between Tours and Bordeaux had a fault. The French representatives were extremely anxious. Meanwhile, General Jodl, Commander-in-Chief of the German Wehrmacht, waited for news by the forest. By 5 p.m., the telephone line was still not connected, and it was proposed that the French representatives use a wireless telephone instead, when suddenly the telephone line connected. The French representatives gathered around the telephone. General Huntziger, the chief French representative, began the conversation, followed by Ambassador Noel. The telephone then suddenly cut off. Schmidt, a ministerial-level translator from the German Foreign Office, was invited to the French representatives' car at 6 p.m. General Huntziger, the chief French representative, requested an extension of time. By this point, five hours had passed since the end of the negotiations. General Jodl, Commander-in-Chief of the German Wehrmacht, then accepted this request in a German letter, stipulating that 7:30 p.m. was the latest deadline. Schmidt handed the letter to the French delegation and went to the place by the forest where General Jodl was waiting for news. After a brief discussion, the French representatives invited the German representatives to board the car. General Jodl led the German representatives to board the car. After a ten-minute meeting between the representatives of the two countries, the French delegation announced its readiness to sign. The Franco-German armistice was signed at 6:50 p.m. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<h3>The New York Times Reviews the Consequences of France's Capitulation, Saying France Will Become a Tool of the German War Machine Against Its Will</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Times reported that the French people would be able to judge the harsh terms imposed on them by Compiègne and Rome in the future. They would have many opportunities to wonder whether this terrible punishment was lighter than if the French government had continued to resist from the colonies or foreign territories. France may retain traces of independence, but they will be nominal. At present, France will become a tool of the German war machine against its will. The enemy may gain from it various secrets shared by France and its allies, and even the plans surrounding the unconquerable bird's nest fortress will be handed over to the enemy under duress. The newspaper continued that British Prime Minister Churchill had indicated that France's acceptance of the armistice treaty was tantamount to becoming an active enemy. The terrible result is that Britain will be forced to fight against the French territories now occupied by the enemy, or to bomb French cities and accidentally injure French civilians, or to suffer along with France when Germany is tightly blockaded.

<h3>London Comments on Armistice Agreement, Calling it France's Utter Shame</h3>
<p>London: After the signing of the armistice agreement between Germany and France, responsible officials here issued a statement commenting on it, saying, "This agreement forces France to hand over all its troops, armaments, and various goods to Germany, and to allow Germany to occupy most of its territory as a base for operations against Britain. The French government may live in peace in the south, but it must be completely at the mercy of Germany. As for the peace treaty to be negotiated between Germany and France, there is no indication of its content at this time. However, one point is very clear: Germany has no intention of discussing peace at this time. In a word, this armistice agreement has forced France to completely surrender. French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently gave a radio address, saying that France would never accept humiliating conditions, but what conditions could be more humiliating than this? France has a solemn treaty with Britain, stating that it will never make a separate peace. At this moment, it is using its territory and material resources to allow the enemy to attack its allies, which is utterly shameful. In short, Foreign Minister Baudouin's declaration and the alliance treaty between Britain and France have been completely destroyed by the Pétain government. This act of losing faith is not only deeply hated by French expatriates overseas, but will also be unanimously condemned by the people of the country. The people of the country have been prevented by this move of the government from emulating other countries that have been invaded by Germany, and from continuing to fight against the common enemy in an environment where they have good hope of ultimate victory. Deprivation is not tragic. Our Prime Minister Churchill announced yesterday that Britain would uphold the claims of the French nation, and that Britain's victory is the only hope for France to restore its greatness and its people to restore their freedom." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Comment on the Armistice Issue</h3>
<p>Bordeaux: Yesterday, French newspapers all published editorials, forcefully stating that the French army's armistice was out of necessity. Before requesting an armistice, the French army had exhausted its efforts in combat, and it was forced to do so only when it could no longer fight. The conservative newspaper "Le Figaro" commented on the armistice, saying, "We should not show weakness, nor should we hate. France's war is not for material interests. France's defeat will not lead to the loss of its national prestige. France fought to save culture, and has done its utmost." Le Petit Parisien quoted General Jodl, the German representative in the armistice negotiations, praising the French army, and said, "We already know that the French army is brave and invincible in combat, and has done its utmost to resist the invaders." Also, the semi-official French newspaper "Le Temps" wrote that if Britain at that time could send a well-equipped army to France, France would never have been forced to beg Hitler for peace.

<h3>The Situation in the Balkans is Becoming Increasingly Delicate, with Rumors that Italy is Laying Mines in Greek Territorial Waters, and the Soviet Union Denying Negotiations with Turkey</h3>
<p>Budapest: The competition between the Soviet Union and the German-Italian Axis for political and economic control of the Balkans is becoming increasingly apparent today. It is claimed that the Italian Navy has laid mines in Greek territorial waters to block shipping to Turkey, Syria, and Egypt. The development of the situation in Romania last week is enough to show that the friction between the Axis powers and Moscow is becoming increasingly tense. Because of the Soviet Union's serious oppression of Bucharest, King Carol of Romania has been unable to comply with the requests of Germany and Italy to establish a completely right-wing government. Observers here say that Italy's laying of mines in Greek territorial waters is a warning to the Soviet Union not to try to interfere in Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey, because Italy demands to obtain a passage in order to attack Thessaloniki and Istanbul if necessary. As for the Soviet Union's military occupation of the Baltic states and its deployment of a hundred divisions of the Red Army to the German-Soviet border between the Baltic and Black Seas, it is believed here that this is due to the Soviet Union's confusion in view of the war activities of the Fascists and Nazis. It is generally believed here that if the Soviet Union launches an attack, it will simultaneously rush into Bessarabia and Bulgaria. Because of this, Romania may become a battleground in the Balkans. This week, the Soviet Minister to Budapest invited senior officials here, as well as the envoys of Germany, Italy, and Japan, to the Soviet Embassy to watch a movie. The name of the first film was "Peter the Great," which shows its profound significance (United Press, 24th)</p>

<h3>The Times of London Discusses the Future of the War: The Soul of Europe Will Not Die and Will Eventually Be Liberated</h3>
<p>London: The Times of London today published an editorial criticizing the terms of the armistice accepted by the Bordeaux government, saying that Great Britain and other places where the British flag flies undoubtedly or without hesitation know that our war is not only for self-defense. There is something more to it. What Nazi Germany, with its entire self-esteem of eugenics, offers to mankind is nothing but servitude. Only its occasional position today, if force can do it, will impose its negotiation system on Europe by force. Know that force can never accomplish this. The soul of Europe will never die and one day will liberate its body. This is the faith held by the British, French, and their friends on the American continent. Since the Bordeaux French government personnel ceased fighting, the European war has failed, and the ocean war has not yet broken out. When the British Empire is fully aided by the survivors of all countries that cherish freedom, if it is not defeated for a day, then Hitler has not won for a day. We may need to use our strength to the extreme, or we may need to use the full force of the navy and air force to fight. However, if we insist, Hitler will be defeated. The British Empire must stand as the world's only hope, and it is also the only hope for France to be free (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Wartime Preparations Amidst the Turmoil: Increasing Combat Personnel and Expanding the Scope of Conscription</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the expansion of the European war situation, the Hong Kong authorities have become increasingly rigorous in their wartime preparations. Although the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffry Northcote, has left Hong Kong on vacation last month, it is said that he consulted with the Singapore authorities when he passed through Singapore to discuss the connection between Singapore and Hong Kong to facilitate military operations. He also decided to implement the opening of war taxes in Hong Kong before leaving Hong Kong. Therefore, the War Tax Bureau has recently notified major commercial firms to report their business accounts for last year within a month. Those who conceal or falsely report figures to underreport after the deadline will be charged with violating the War Tax Act. This shows one aspect of the preparations.</p>
<p>Strengthening Strength: Establishing a Compulsory Military Service Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding strength, the Hong Kong authorities are actively seeking to increase combat personnel. Therefore, the scope of conscription has been expanded, and combat supplementary regiments have been added. In addition to the regular army, Hong Kong usually has naval and land volunteer forces, which are voluntary in nature, and their organization and equipment are comparable to the regular army. In the past three years, due to the many events in Europe, they have been actively expanding and intensifying training. People of various nationalities, including Chinese, English, Portuguese, and Indian, have participated, with the English being the most numerous. The Army Volunteer Force has a total of six battalions of high-射炮 anti-aircraft gun, machine gun, and rifle units. The Navy Volunteer Force has multiple patrol boats. Recently, ships coming and going to the Hong Kong port have been rented for further training. A unit has been dispatched to patrol the port and perform guard duties. As for the British in Hong Kong, they had previously received instructions from London to enlist in Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities have established a compulsory military service bureau to review the British men of conscription age residing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In addition to those who have already joined the volunteer army, the rest will be assigned to the combat ranks of the navy and army. Therefore, many British expatriates in Shanghai have also come to Hong Kong to enlist. Those who do not want to join the combat team due to their jobs or circumstances must provide sufficient reasons and be approved by the compulsory military service tribunal, then they can be assigned to the guarding posts and sentry of the Army Volunteer Force to be mobilized temporarily. Previously, the military service tribunal ordered 350 people to take on this task. However, the Hong Kong authorities believe that the Hong Kong environment urgently needs to increase the wartime manpower source. Therefore, it was decided to select the patrol posts and incorporate them into the combat supplementary regiment to make them enlist in training and combat. It is also heard that 120 people have been selected.</p>
<p>Inspecting Ships: Defenses are Extremely Tight</p>
<p>As for the Hong Kong sea port, under the management of the naval authorities, it is sealed off at any time, inspecting ships entering and exiting the port, and dispatching speedboats to sail outside the port to patrol back and forth, so as to make the port and sea defense perfect. In addition, the air defense drill has recently been held twice. According to the statement issued by Mr. Speicher, the Director of Air Defense, the exercise results are still good. The air defense rescue team is also working hard to learn fire fighting techniques, and their results are also very good. After Italy announced its participation in the European War, the Hong Kong government immediately dispatched a special detective team to the residences and shops of Italian expatriates to monitor the Italian expatriates. The disposal method is the same as the disposal of German and Austrian expatriates in September last year. However, under special circumstances, it is exempted from being sent to concentration camps with the special permission of the Hong Kong government, and only police officers monitor their actions. The Italian consulate has stopped working immediately. As for Italian shipping companies, the Italian staff is monitored by a special detective team. The Chinese staff is dismissed after being interrogated, leaving only servants and Chinese and British detectives to guard. The remaining Italian church missionaries and nuns are specially allowed to maintain the status quo temporarily. However, the property kept by the priests and nuns in Hong Kong must not be moved. It can be said that the disposal is going smoothly.</p>
<h3>The Zhe-Gan Railway Extends to Ganzhou and Construction Begins at the Beginning of the Month</h3>
<p>Nancheng Correspondence: The Zhe-Gan Railway from Guixi to Ganzhou, which connects the major arteries of the southeast and southwest, planned to build a branch road in Ganzhou with the light rail unloaded when the Zhe-Gan Railway converted the light rail from Xiaoshan to Yushan to heavy rail in 1936. At that time, two lines were selected: one from Zhangshu along the Gan River to Ganzhou, and the other from the intersection of the Beijing-Gan and Zhe-Gan lines in Guixi through eastern Gan to Ganzhou. Although both lines have been surveyed, they failed due to various reasons. Now the authorities have decided to complete this road in the shortest possible time. It is found that this line crosses Yuqi from Guixi and crosses the Xujiang River in Nancheng, southward to Nanfeng, Guangchang, Ningdu, and reaches Ganzhou. It is about 300 kilometers long. The survey has already been completed and civil workers will be recruited to build in sections. Construction is scheduled to begin on July 1 and be completed by the end of the year. After this road is successful, it can be connected to the Yue-Gui and Yue-Han lines from Ganzhou to Shaoguan, serving as a major artery connecting the southeast and southwest.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Relief for the Rice Shortage: 200 People Starve to Death in Shaoxing Every Day</h3>
<p>Yongkang Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Grain Management Office learned that the rice shortage in the counties under Shaoxing is severe, the price of rice in Shaoxing is exceptionally high, and the black market price has risen to over 100 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>The average number of people starving to death reaches 200 per day, and the autumn harvest is still far away. The source of Gan rice is also gradually decreasing. In order to understand the grain demand figures of the grain-deficient counties so as to find ways to provide relief, a provincial grain conference was specially convened in Yongkang at 3 pm on the 12th. More than one hundred people attended, including commissioners of various districts, county heads of various counties, and local gentry. Provincial party and government committees also participated, and Huang Shaohong personally presided over the meeting. The content of the discussion included (1) sources of rice, (2) improving grain management methods, (3) increasing the purchase price of grain-surplus counties, (4) strictly practicing thrift and adjusting distribution, (5) granary preparations, and (6) general survey of grain prices. All representatives believed that they were essential and must be implemented. The government formulated measures for various counties to follow. If representatives have any opinions, they can submit them in writing within ten days. Representatives from the counties under Ningbo proposed that the procedures for collecting export certificates should be used to subsidize grain, which should be handled by each county according to local conditions. Deng Ren, the magistrate of Shaoxing County, made a temporary motion, requesting the provincial government to transport grain to Shaoxing as soon as possible to meet the needs of the military and the people and maintain local stability. Zhu Huiqing, deputy director of the Grain Management Office, replied that 70,000 dan of rice had been purchased to relieve the rice shortage in Shaoxing and was being shipped successively to be properly distributed for various counties to purchase and transport, and the transportation problem would be borne jointly by the various counties. Chairman Huang also instructed the county heads to pay attention to the grain shortage in the coming year, find ways to plant arable land, plant as much miscellaneous grain as possible, and promote thrift, and implement them effectively after returning to office. The provincial government also resolved to allocate 50,000 yuan and allocate another 30,000 yuan from the grain accumulation funds in Shaoxing to subsidize the economic porridge factory expenses in Shaoxing County.</p>
<h3>The Initial Situation of the European War (VII)</h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>On the eve of the declaration of war on Germany by Britain and France when the German-Polish war broke out, Franco broadcasted the following: "I appeal to the sense of responsibility and goodwill of all countries and governments, hoping to use their efforts as much as possible to localize this war (referring to the German-Polish war - author's note). The expansion of a war will inevitably cause a profound and irreparable disruption of the world economy, countless losses of world resources, paralyze world trade, and give the general public a severe blow to the standard of living. If this war is further expanded, then the seeds of a bigger war in the future will be sown."</p>
<p>This passage truly expresses Spain's intentions. First, she admits that the German-Polish war is justified; second, she opposes the "expansion" of the war by Britain and France; if Britain and France declare war on Germany, then they are the instigators of disrupting the world's economic life; and, incidentally, she gives Britain and France a threat that Spain may participate.</p>
<p>(6) Other Countries Declaring "Neutrality" (September 20)</p>
<p>The Second European War has been going on for exactly twenty days since the curtain was raised on the German-Polish War on September 1. In addition to the positions of the various countries that have already been described above in this war, the attitudes of the remaining countries are also an indispensable part of understanding this decisive picture of the European war situation. Here, I will first give them a temporary general classification.</p>
<p>The European political units left over from the last European war are thirty-five: England, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, Iceland, France, Germany, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, San Marino, Andorra, the Soviet Union, Luxembourg, Monaco, Liechtenstein, the Irish Free State, and the Free City of Danzig.</p>
<p>However, before this war broke out, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Albania, three countries had already been eliminated.</p>
<p>The Free City of Danzig was the fuse for Germany's invasion of Poland. The participants in the war were Germany on one side and Britain, France, and Poland on the other. A total of four countries. The Soviet Union's position is different from any country and has special significance.</p>
<p>Italy declared "non-participation in the war," but it is clear that she is an ally of Germany; Spain declared "neutrality," but in attitude, she is biased towards Germany. - These two countries are one type.</p>
<p>Turkey declared "loyalty" to the British and French alliance treaties, but did not participate in the war; Romania, in fact, is equal to an ally of Britain and France, but declared "neutrality." - These two countries are another type.</p>
<p>After removing the above thirteen political units, there are twenty-two political units remaining in Europe. Among them, there are two that have not yet formally declared "neutrality." - Hungary, Greece.</p>
<p>The rest have all declared so-called "neutrality" one after another. Here are the attitudes of three of the more important countries among them.</p>
<p>Belgium - Belgium, which suffered from the misfortune of being caught in the crossfire in the last European war, is once again bearing the brunt. Theoretically, for strategic reasons, the belligerent countries that drag her into the vortex are more likely to be Germany. Therefore, starting from this assumption, her defenses are entirely facing the German side. However, in fact, Britain and France, which subjectively hope that she will join the vortex, are not inferior to Germany, because they estimate that if Belgium does not join, then it will be, if she joins, it must be on the side of Britain and France, that means to say, the British and French side can immediately have another ally. Therefore, recently the propaganda of Britain and France and the propaganda of Germany have become two interesting contrasts. Germany is trying its best to deny any intention to invade Belgium. On the contrary, it says that Britain and France want to violate her neutrality; at the same time, it is doing its best to encourage her to resist. Following that, it released a threat: "If Belgium acquiesces in Britain and France destroying her neutrality, then Germany also has the right to take convenient action and no longer has any obligation to respect her neutrality." On the British and French side, they are reminding her of the lessons of the last European war every day, encouraging her to prepare for the German invasion, and saying: "Belgium can rest assured that on the first day the German army sets foot on Belgian territory, the British and French allied forces will be able to come to the rescue immediately." However, standing on Belgium's position, she has no ambition to expand her territory, nor does she want to offer her territory as someone else's battlefield. Therefore, her most advantageous path is to be a truly "neutral" to the end. Therefore, the propaganda and pressure from both sides of the belligerent countries are things that make her "painful." When Britain, France and Germany declared war, Belgium also immediately issued a general mobilization order nationwide, not to prepare to join any side to fight, but indeed to prepare to "guarantee its own neutrality."

<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Li Xin Accounting Supplementary School: The Municipal Li Xin Accounting Supplementary School originally had night school, morning school, Sunday school, and correspondence school, etc. Although the talents trained in each period are already considerable, in order to achieve the original purpose of providing students with study in their spare time, each semester can only study one or two tax courses, which takes a long time, and is often too impatient for those who have not yet been employed and are eager to quickly become a good accounting talent. Therefore, it was decided to add one class each in the middle school group and university group intensive courses in the next semester. It is stipulated that there will be 20 hours of class per week, and various necessary courses such as elementary accounting, advanced accounting, cost accounting, bank accounting, government accounting, and auditing will be completed in two semesters, so as to prepare students graduating from middle school and university general subjects or those with equivalent qualifications to learn a skill in the shortest possible time to facilitate those who are about to be employed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Table Tennis movement, through the efforts of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) at 999 Jing'an Temple Road for the past year, has gained widespread attention from society.

<h3>Finance: Chinese Merchants Selling Foreign Exchange En Masse</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The underground market for British and American currencies showed a persistent downward trend, especially the US dollar today, which was particularly weak. This was mainly due to a sharp rise of more than 1 jiao and 3 fen in the exchange rate between British and American currencies in the early morning. Trading was lively throughout the day, with Chinese banks such as Huaqiao and Shanghai selling foreign exchange en masse, which was the main reason for the weakening. However, there were no reports of Chinese speculators entering or leaving the market, resulting in a shortage of scalpers. The strongest US dollar in the morning was 6.125 yuan, with the closing price remaining stable. In the afternoon, the market became increasingly rigid. Chinese banks quoted 6.125 yuan and 6 yuan for six-seven month swaps, indicating a discount of 0.125 yuan. Furthermore, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank (Y.S.K.) also sought to sell a considerable amount of spot US dollars, with the price reaching 6.15625 yuan at one point. However, American banks absorbed a significant amount, causing the price to slightly recover after the weakening. As a result, the closing prices were 3 shillings 9.6875 pence for British gold and 6.09375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the closing prices last Saturday, British gold remained unchanged, while the US dollar rose sharply by 0.125 yuan. Futures also remained firm.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Also Intend to Sell</p>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rates between British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also stable. The rate against France did not change. The exchange rate between American and British currencies rose by 1 jiao and 3.75 fen, while the rate against Shanghai rose sharply by 2 jiao. There was no change in the rate against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates, such as those of the Bank of China, opened with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 9.375 pence for British gold and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.03125 pence tighter for British gold and 0.09375 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to the closing prices last Saturday evening. This was due to the sharp rise in exchange rates. After the opening, Chinese banks came to sell, causing the market to become harder. It was reported that Chinese banks sold US dollars for July to foreign and American banks at prices ranging from 5.9375 yuan to 5.96875 yuan. Later, the Shanghai branch of Chinese banks even sold US dollars for the same month at 6 yuan. The HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver equalization tax also showed no increase or decrease. After that, foreign and American banks were also filled with intentions to supply, so the price became more volatile. It was reported that foreign banks, including Arnhold &amp; Co. and American banks, purchased British gold for June at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence. At that time, the strongest US dollar had already reached 6.125 yuan. However, the market stabilized shortly after American banks and others stopped selling. By the time of the noon close, British gold was at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 6.09375 yuan, the same prices as the spot prices for June. British gold for July was at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar was at 5.96875 yuan, which was 0.03125 pence weaker for British gold and 0.03125 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to the opening spot prices. Futures remained firm across the board.</p>
<p>US Dollar Drops Sharply by 0.125 Yuan</p>
<p>After the afternoon opening, the market remained rigid. It was reported that Chinese banks swapped US dollars for this month at 6.125 yuan and for July at 6 yuan, indicating a discount of 0.125 yuan. Subsequently, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank (Y.S.K.) came to the market to sell spot US dollars at a low price of 6.15625 yuan. Although the Japanese bank sold a considerable amount, the American banks absorbed a significant amount, causing the price to recover slightly. As a result, British gold was at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 6.09375 yuan. British gold for July was at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar was at 6 yuan, which was the same for British gold and 0.125 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to the closing spot prices last weekend. British gold for July also remained unchanged, while the US dollar weakened by 0.15625 yuan.</p>

<h3>Interest in Holding Gold is Weak: Only Scalping Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cash gold speculation in the underground market was sluggish and unable to gain momentum. The exchange market's downward trend and the lack of positive news reduced operators' interest in holding gold. There were only scalping transactions. The result of the transactions showed weakness from the early morning. The opening price was 80 yuan lower at 5,430 yuan. Banks and securities firms sold one after another, pushing the price down to a low of 5,350 yuan. Later, with the support of certain money exchange businesses, the price recovered to 5,475 yuan, but transactions were extremely rare. The noon closing price was 5,400 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was only 5,390 yuan, and under the continued selling by securities firms and banks, the price fell again to 5,350 yuan. As a result, with the support of money exchange businesses and certain banks buying, the price closed at 5,400 yuan, down 110 yuan from last Saturday. After the closing, the price slightly dropped to 5,390 yuan. Later, there were rumors from French and Japanese sources, so the final price was 5,430 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 125 yuan throughout the day, and the trading volume was relatively strong, about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed 20 yuan lower, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Squeezed Down by 110 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels), initially with the sharp rise in exchange rates and the US dollar reported weakening, caused people to feel exhausted. The market opened with a sharp drop of 80 yuan, with gold shops and money exchange businesses selling 20 taels at 5,430 yuan. Subsequently, with the support of certain banks and securities firms, the price briefly rebounded by 30 yuan, with banks mutually trading 10 taels at 5,460 yuan. However, as foreign exchange continued to weaken, another bank and certain gold shops competed to dump and push the price down by 110 yuan, with banks and money exchange businesses selling 30 taels at a low of 5,350 yuan. After that, certain banks continued to buy and add to their positions, and with the foreign exchange market slightly turning around, general retail short sellers came to cover their positions. At the same time, gold shop assistants also came to search for purchases, pushing the price back above the 5,400 yuan mark. Banks mutually traded 20 taels at 5,475 yuan. The market situation turned downward again at noon, as certain gold shops remained filled with intentions to sell, and the price declined by several tens of yuan again. Gold shops sold 20 taels to banks at 5,400 yuan. The situation remained sluggish when the market opened in the afternoon, with securities firms selling a total of 10 taels to banks, pushing the price down to 5,390 yuan. Subsequently, as securities firms continued to unload, and certain money exchange businesses also sold, the price fell another 20 yuan, with securities firms selling 30 taels to gold shops at 5,370 yuan. Later, as gold shops came to buy, and sellers decreased, the price rebounded by 25 yuan, with gold shops buying 20 taels from securities firms at 5,395 yuan. At that time, securities firms re-expressed intentions to sell, and certain banks followed suit by short selling, pushing the price down by 45 yuan. Certain banks sold 20 taels to jewelry shops at 5,350 yuan. Afterwards, people's sentiment gradually changed, buyers increased, and money exchange businesses and banks frequently bought, pushing the price back up by 50 yuan, with banks mutually trading 30 taels at 5,400 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by 110 yuan compared to last weekend, with a fluctuation of 125 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold at the main brands of gold shops was about ten yuan higher than speculation, while the purchasing price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at 550 Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, jewelry gold for sale at major gold shops was still listed at 570 yuan per tael. At 9:35 AM, the price was reduced by 10 yuan, and at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the price was reduced by another 10 yuan. After that, there were no changes. It was reported that major gold shops changed the listing to 550 yuan, with new shops having the same price as the previous price, and the purchasing price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rebounds by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills of exchange showed a slight rebound, with the discount rate for every thousand yuan starting at 75 yuan and requiring 80 yuan for selling, a rebound of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Exchange Association also rose by 1 fen, reaching 0.26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw speculation suddenly trending lower, with British and American gold pounds falling in tandem. The supply and demand for British gold notes was relatively balanced, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes initially retreated to 16.2 yuan due to a sudden increase in the price of the pound in the morning, and although they rose twice to 16.5 yuan, they eventually trended lower, resulting in a drop of 0.15 yuan compared to last Saturday. The supply of Hong Kong notes was strong, and the market price was very soft. There was no shortage of supply of Robi notes and Philippine notes, and the market price fell. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes was even, and the market price remained stable, with the evening price at 1.09 yuan. There was slightly more demand for Korean notes, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening price at 0.96 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Plummets by 1-2 Yuan: Japonica Rice Insists on Not Weakening; Let's See the Determination of the Tin Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>Since the report last week that South Seas shipping for foreign rice could pass smoothly and that there was no blockade of goods at the coastal defense, the foreign rice market would have shown signs of weakness if there were no brisk sales in the mainland. Yesterday, the market opened with a day off for the week, and people's minds were still difficult to grasp, all showing a wait-and-see attitude. Suddenly, the way to Zhejiang Province in the mainland, with a certain party issuing that the transportation of rice on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line must obtain a passport from today, the general Hakka people reported that the formalities had not been completed, and that there would be an additional fee, they all stopped. The market situation was unusually deserted as a result. At this time, floating speculators, seeing that the situation was not good and that the price was high and dangerous, no longer remained silent and began to sell at discounted prices. For a time, there was a rush to sell each other, and the quoted prices fell frequently. Saigon No. 2 was only 61.5 yuan, Bank Warehouse was slightly squeezed to 60.05 yuan, and Shanghai Pudong Warehouse was at 60.03 yuan, and Tokyo's top rice was at 59.5 yuan. By the afternoon, new orders for foreign rice had been confirmed, and Shenji Foreign Company dumped 1,850 tons of Siam No. 2 rice to be shipped on the 26th of this month, priced at only 64.3 yuan, which was 3-4 yuan cheaper than the recycled goods on the market. People's minds were weak, profits were fully released, speculation disappeared, and the market plummeted by 1-2 yuan. There were several rounds of hovering, but the result was still soft. In addition, with the showers, the acceptance by importers was also sluggish. The evening closing prices for Siam No. 2 and Tribute No. 2 rice were only around 61 yuan, with Bank Warehouse slightly squeezed to 60.034 yuan, and a few small traders in a hurry to sell even lowering their prices to below 60 yuan, at 59.8 yuan. Early market prices for recycled Siam No. 2 18-bag rice were 67 yuan, down 1.5 yuan from Saturday, and then ranged from 67.5 yuan to 68 yuan, but there was also a lack of demand in the evening market. The total number of futures recycled throughout the day was 250 tons, and there were 8,000 bags in stock.</p>
<p>Also, according to news, foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, transporting 20,008 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded yesterday. The company's Xinjiang ship also arrived on the 23rd, also carrying 11,784 bags from Hong Kong, which were docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although the arrival of Japonica and Glutinous national rice was continuous, it was not large, only nearly 1,000 bags in total. Due to the heavy rain, the underground market for Japonica rice was still strong, and it was not affected by foreign rice or rainfall. There were still many transactions, and the selling price was similar to the previous price. Changbang's special clear Japonica rice was 75 yuan, Su Kun and Changzhou Japonica rice were 73-74 yuan, Qingsi's special thin rice was 73-74 yuan, large-grain rice was 71-72 yuan, and old rice was 70 yuan. Nangang's early rice was 69 yuan. The sales market for Glutinous rice turned inferior, and the situation was not as firm as before, with the price depreciating by about half a yuan. Early Kimli special yuan rice was 60 yuan, Dan Chang Baiyuan rice was 58-59 yuan, and Jiangbei goods were around 57 yuan.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Rice Milling Industry Association held a meeting on the 20th and decided to advise fellow traders to sell their stocks as much as possible to meet the market demand, and also agreed on a limited price of 20.5 yuan per dan for Japonica rice, 40 yuan per shi for coarse Japonica rice, and 43 yuan for white Japonica rice, and not to increase the price again, in order to maintain the people's food supply. Each rice factory must be responsible for automatically refusing large-scale purchases by certain merchants and transporting them out of the country. If anyone violates the agreement, the industry's transactions will be suspended, and all factories and businesses will comply with the agreement with full stamps. (Zhi)</p>
<h3>Noodles Rise by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: The plate of Factory No. 2 flour yesterday rose from 13.8 yuan to 14.3 yuan, adding half a yuan steeper than before. The reason for the rise was that the Chinese factories were affected by the obstruction of new wheat, and the raw materials were about to run out, and there was a situation where there was no goods to supply. Remedial measures have been discussed and agreed upon, and it has been resolved that all guest traders and hoarders will stop selling, and the normal supply will be provided according to the current actual sales volume of this street. Therefore, the factory plate will be actually increased. However, with the current high price of rice, the sales volume in this street is increasing day by day, and the direct distribution by the factory is no less than 10,000 bags. Recycled goods are even more profitable due to the increase in the factory plate. The asking price for Lao Che Pi is 15 yuan, and the asking price for Lu Pao Che and Tian Zhu and other flours is 17 yuan, but they are not formal market prices.</p>
<p>Also, it has been found that since the price of rice has been expensive, flour has attracted the attention of the general public, and the factory's production is limited, and there is a situation where they are unable to meet the demand. It is heard that Tianjin has ordered more than 100,000 bags of Australian flour and foreign flour, and local grain merchants have also ordered foreign flour. It is said that the Tianjin side has ordered Australian flour, and the local side has ordered American flour, estimated at more than 50,000 bags, and the price is 15.5 yuan, which is considered cheap.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat supply still failed to return to normal, and the Japanese factories have repeatedly received supplies, and their situation is special and cannot be compared with the same day, while the Chinese factories, in view of the current harsh environment, cannot directly purchase from the producing areas, and have no choice but to release prices and start purchasing from grain merchants, businesses, and a certain party. It is heard that yesterday, Fufeng Factory received more than 500 bags of new wheat from Wuhu and Jiangbei, priced at 24.3 yuan to 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Remains Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market price for securities remained in an uninspired state, with rises and falls inconsistent. Domestic bonds once reached as high as 50 yuan, and the high price summoned sellers, but the price then entered the customs again in the afternoon, but Class A bonds were raised to 61 yuan again. The environmental situation changed in many ways, and it was difficult to know whether there were positive or negative factors. The sluggishness of the market was partly due to the gradual reduction of floating buyers, and the floating sellers fluctuated uncertainly, and partly because the situation was extremely chaotic, rumors arose, and the principal and interest payments of the government bonds themselves could still be advanced by the bank. With a mixture of joy and sorrow, they restrained each other, so every day they continued to fluctuate in a small range. Yesterday's transactions on both markets were nothing more than scalping transactions by a few people on the trading floor, and the turnover was still only more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 69.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the Public Works Association yesterday showed little change, and the shares of Yinglian and Yihuo were the most popular.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: After South Sales Were Blocked, There is Talk of Maintaining Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market is again flat and sluggish, but the trend is slightly more stable, but actual transactions are relatively light. This is because the Hong Kong border is constantly harassed by the Japanese army, and transportation to the mainland is becoming more difficult, and people's hearts are depressed. However, in eastern Zhejiang, procurement has been active recently, but the amount is very small. However, the degree of decline has been deep, and some people have come out to buy and maintain the market. Otherwise, there may be branches in June.</p>
<p>Due to the firm and high popularity for ten days, the opening price of current yarn was also good, and the price of 20s Double Horse yarn was 990 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the high price opened, sellers came in droves, and because the Guangbang business was also suspended, the situation was even more virtual, and it fell straight to 940 yuan. In an instant, the number of buyers increased again, and many said that the factory came out to buy and maintain the market, so a downward trend was recovered and rose to 960 yuan again, and the closing price was 953 yuan. However, after the closing, the price reached 966 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 1,480 bales, and the market fell by 24 yuan. The amount of each bank's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 70 Same industry 1,270</p>
<p>Ningbo 140 Total 1,480</p>
<h3>Factory Offices Suspended: Cotton Underground Market Also Small</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still sluggish and has no characteristics, and the outside world's mood is very weak, because there is no demand from all parties. At the same time, the cotton yarn market is depressed, and factories are not active. Although there are one or two private deals, the amount is very small, and the market is also cheap.</p>
<p>Another message is that the outside cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is very quiet. With the purchase of Wall Street in the market, and the purchase of spot merchants, the market turned active, and the result closing price rose eight or nine pounds more than the seventh. The Indian market was firm, and yesterday it rose more than 4 Robbie.</p>
<p>The Shanghai cotton trade has been very dull in recent days, and the minds of all parties are weak. The current spot price has been cheaper than the futures price of foreign companies, and still lacks people to inquire. According to the current market situation, I do not know when it will turn around.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Tin Cocoon Merchants Are Scams: Received Cocoon from Farmers; Did Not Send Money to Farmers</h3>
<p>There are more than 300 large and small cocoon shops in the three counties of Xiwu and Cheng, most of which collect cocoons on behalf of the "China Central Company." At that time, a contract was established to falsely establish a fresh cocoon price list. If the orchid price rose and fell, it would be calculated according to the report. At the time of payment, except for a small amount of deposit paid first at the time of ordering, the rest will be paid in silver when the dry cocoons are transported to the city. At the time of weighing, due to the special circumstances, the cocoon shops still issued joint tickets as in the previous year, and the date of distribution was announced, stating that the dry cocoons were transported to the city, received the money, and returned home to pay. Now that most of the dry cocoons have been transported to the city, each line has requested the "China Central Company" to pay and settle accounts as agreed. The issue of cocoon prices has not yet been settled, and there are tens of thousands of households in the countryside who hold joint tickets, because cash has not yet been received, and they have been sitting and demanding money from the cocoon shops. The main cocoon shops cannot deal with this situation, and they have gathered in Wuxi to discuss and negotiate with the "China Central Company." If a solution is not quickly sought, there will still be dry cocoons left in the countryside, and it will be difficult to transport them to the city. In this case, the farmers' hard work of raising silkworms will be in vain. (Liang)</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silk Comes to Shanghai: Taxed 300 Yuan: The Industry Seeks Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Although the Wuxi silk coming to Shanghai has not actually been subjected to a donation of 12%, it has been greatly restricted. Several pieces of silk have already obtained a transfer certificate (the so-called pass), which requires a pass fee of 300 yuan in legal tender per dan. After July, a special donation of nearly 600 yuan will be required. Yesterday, the silk factory industry association specially convened a meeting to seek countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Falls</h3>
<p>There was no market in New York yesterday, and the price of Yokohama silk fell. The spot price was 1,445 yuan, down 15 yuan, the near-term price was 1,451 yuan, down 20 yuan, and the long-term price was 1,510 yuan, down 17 yuan. The local silk market was quiet, and there seemed to be no hope of expansion.</p>
<p>Also, 50 boxes of rayon arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>All Tea Exports Have Stopped</h3>
<p>The sales of black and green tea in foreign shops in this city have completely stopped in recent days. Since Italy implemented its participation in the war, shipping in the Mediterranean has been interrupted. Recently, all foreign companies have returned the tea boxes they reported to customs, causing people to lose heart and there is no transaction. However, the domestic sales of tea have slightly improved in the north recently. Recently, the Tianjin traders have searched for 1,800 bags of Maofeng Yushui Hongmei and other goods, which will be shipped soon.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Goods Rebound: National Cloth Rises</h3>
<p>National Cloth: The cloth market rose slightly yesterday. After the recent sharp fall in cloth prices, the Eastern Piece Goods rebounded strongly, and the market atmosphere has changed greatly with rain in various places. The demand in this street is gradually increasing, and the guest merchants have also absorbed it. The selling plate is average, and the falling trend has been curbed. The volume of rough cloth traded on this street was more than 200 pieces, and the volume of unbleached cloth and dyed cloth was nearly 300 pieces. Wen Yong traders traded more than 100 pieces of fine twill rough cloth, and Hong Kong traders traded 50-60 pieces of fine twill fine cloth. North Road Qingdao Tianjin and other traders traded more than 200 pieces of bleached cloth, blue cloth, and line cloth. 154 pieces of ramie cloth were shipped from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The rising trend continued. The opening price of Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 31.5 yuan per piece. Because the Qinhuangdao traders purchased it, people in this street were optimistic and the demand to cover shorts was very strong. The price continued to rise, and the closing price at noon was 32.5 yuan. The black market rose to 33 yuan in the black market. Serge rose to 89 cents. The foreign company opened more than 300 pieces of fine cloth for next month in the morning, with prices ranging from 33.5 yuan to 34.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Western Woolen Cloth: Goods Are Scarce and Prices Are Expensive</h3>
<p>Western woolen cloth, regardless of whether it is light, heavy, thin or thick, English-made, French-made, Italian-made, Polish-made, or local goods, is in short supply and expensive. The autumn and winter goods that need to be sold in the second half of the year are especially in short supply. The firms that have existing goods in hand are all taking the opportunity to hoard them, and they all ignore the tightening of exchange rates and how the domestic and international situation will change. People are always optimistic, and now that the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou traders continue to open businesses, the various single traders are buying and cutting prosperously, but transportation is difficult, and ways will be found later.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Trends Differ</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil cake market had different trends. With the help of rain, soybean cakes boosted people's hearts a lot, and the procurement from all parties was enthusiastic, so the market rose by 0.2 yuan. It was reported that 4,000 pieces of Dayou Fourth Brand cakes were traded at a price of 12.6 yuan to 12.65 yuan. 3,000 pieces were ordered for delivery at the end of the month at a price of 12.7 yuan. 6 cars of Feizi cakes were priced at 12.15 yuan to 12.2 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Shengji cakes were priced at 12.1 yuan to 12.3 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Qingzhong cakes were priced at 11.3 yuan. Due to the lack of actual sales, soybean oil was of little interest for speculation. Although a part was forcibly supported, the main market was still sluggish as usual. 70 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 50 dans of Pudong factory soybean oil, and 100 dans of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded. Peanut oil was flat and sluggish, and canned oil was procured by Hong Kong traders, so it was flat, while the only movement in the market for barrel oil was in this street, so the market was still sluggish. Yesterday, 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 69 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous price. 800 cans of Jiangbei local oil were priced at 100 yuan from the original plate, and 10 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were priced at 96 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Although white coal prices were once strained due to rumors of a naval blockade, and dark market prices rose sharply, the market remained unchanged yesterday due to sufficient reserves in the city and no fear of supply shortages. The inter-dealer clearance prices were as follows: Hongji white coal was 216 yuan per ton, No. 1 small coal was 114 yuan, Tongdeli No. 1 and 2 lump coal was 210 yuan per ton, Hongji white coal dust was 140 yuan. All of the above are ex-warehouse prices with delivery by one's own truck. Delivery adds to the transaction cost.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Foreign Sugar Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended downwards due to fewer imports, resulting in a slight drop in prices. The association's listed price for spot 24 crude white sugar was 69.3 yuan outside the warehouse. Small triangular, re-exported goods for July 2 delivery were 55.5 yuan (small amount). For immediate warehouse receipts, the price was 54.85 yuan (small amount). Taikoo Che Bai West Warehouse B mark was 80.5 yuan, and East Warehouse was 80 yuan, with no changes. Dutch red sugar also remained stable at 59.5 yuan. For domestic sugar, a Guangzhou dealer offered 100 bags of high-quality Hainan red sugar at 52 yuan, which was settled at 51.5 to 50 yuan. A few dozen bags of Diao Qing sugar, Chaozhou specifications, were priced at 62.8 yuan. Yesterday, 360 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Pickled Bamboo Shoots Decline</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of pickled bamboo shoots has declined because yellow mold growth can be washed away, and the producing areas can still use bamboo rafts for transportation. It is expected that the supply will be smooth. Recently, six to seven hundred pieces have arrived, so the price has dropped. Yesterday, the market price was 3.2 yuan per small basket for early shoots, 3 yuan for fat shoots, and 2.6 yuan for bald shoots, which is a decrease of 7 to 8 jiao compared to the highest price.</p>
<h3>Metals After the Price of Foreign Nails Fell, New Coiled Wire Followed</h3>
<p>The new coiled wire market has been in a slump since the price of foreign nails fell. Recently, the situation in Vietnam and southern China has become increasingly serious, and merchants there have no time to purchase goods. The only large sales market for foreign nails is the islands of Southeast Asia and the major commercial ports of the South China Sea. Now that the situation has greatly changed, there are no goods to be shipped for foreign nails, and the various merchant groups are also unwilling to purchase them. Therefore, the foreign nail market situation has been severely impacted. Although the local construction industry and retail buyers occasionally make purchases, the volume is small. Therefore, the trend in the nail market is very poor, and the price has fallen from 65.5 yuan to around 60 yuan, causing the new coiled wire market price to follow suit. Yesterday, the market price was 55 yuan per dan (unit of weight), also falling by 4 yuan or so.</p>

<h3>For Those Who Masturbate Excessively Secret Therapy for Post-Marital Sexual Weakness by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</h3>
<p>The most significant hidden concern facing young people is improper sexual behavior. Masturbation is also one of the abnormal sexual behaviors. Not only do young men have this habit, but many women also secretly engage in it.</p>
<p>It must be understood that if there is no sexual behavior as a medium, love will weaken. As the Western proverb says, "A man seeks a woman's love, and a woman grants a man her body." This is indeed true. Then, how can a woman willingly grant her body to her husband? From this perspective, any young person who masturbates excessively, if they do not know the harm and abstain, and try their best to seek treatment, sexual neurasthenia after marriage is inevitable, and the breakdown of love is to be expected. In severe cases, wives often seek other partners because they are deprived of sexual relations for a long time. Therefore, weak husbands and strong wives often have adulterous affairs. Ancient Chinese poets compared the harmony of husband and wife to the zither and lute. Therefore, the poem says, "Husband and wife are harmonious, like playing the zither and lute." This is indeed a worthwhile saying. The sensations of both parties must be coordinated, and they must have the same sensitivity to sexual feelings. When one party's pleasure reaches its peak, the other party's pleasure must also reach its peak, just like the resonance of the zither and lute. Only then can their harmony be permanent.</p>
<p>The harm of masturbation and the importance of sexual power have been described above. Therefore, if we feel kidney deficiency and other kinds of neurasthenia, spinal cord neurasthenia, etc. after marriage, they will also erupt one after another, and life will also feel endangered. Therefore, the method of treatment must start from increasing essence and nourishing blood, and take the German Juwan Essence Preparation "Buti Kang" for men, which can physiologically promote the function of metabolism and increase new essence and blood. In the medical community, it has long been recognized as an effective medicine for treating sexual neurasthenia. The testicular hormones extracted from animals are carefully and scientifically refined. Its female version can regulate menstruation and promote fertility. I have used it clinically for nine years and have never encountered a case where it was ineffective.</p>
<h3>Treatment Report for Kidney Deficiency Syndrome</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Patient Xia Minggang, 33 years old, married at the age of 24. Due to licentious behavior before marriage and indulgence after marriage, his energy has declined in recent years, and symptoms of sexual neurasthenia have appeared in various forms. Not only has he lost erectile power, but his face is pale, he is as thin as a rail, and his weight is only 91 pounds. Knowing that if he does not seek treatment early, the consequences will be dire, he came to the hospital for treatment. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) - Impotence, neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, married for eight years, never had children, often had headaches, tinnitus, palpitations, etc. during the day, and insomnia and night sweats at night. (Treatment method) - Ordered him to strictly observe health preservation, abstain from sex in the short term, and in addition to taking nutritious foods, also gave him face-to-face health preservation methods. He was given 3 tablets of the German testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" for men every day, and 3 tablets of the anti-seminal emission drug "Nairesi Huanjing Pian" before going to bed. After one month, spermatorrhea and seminal emission had stopped, his appetite increased, and his weight increased by only one pound. After two months, neurasthenia and insomnia had stopped, his complexion was ruddy, and his weight increased by another 1.5 pounds. After three months, his weight increased by 4 pounds. After four months, kidney deficiency and impotence were completely cured. After half a year, his weight had increased by a total of 10 pounds, and all symptoms disappeared, so he stopped taking the medicine.</p>
<h3>The Cause and Effect of Gonorrhea and its Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Kechun, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The changes in gonorrhea are numerous, but there are clues to its cause and effect that can be found. With these clues, an experienced doctor, with his excellent treatment methods, can perform a fundamental treatment, and the eradication of gonorrhea is not difficult. If the changes in gonorrhea are due to the unrestricted destruction of gonococci in our body, those who do not quickly eliminate gonococci in the anterior urethra will inevitably develop posterior urethritis. If posterior urethritis is not treated quickly, it will become prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc. These symptoms occur because the treatment to eliminate gonococci is not thorough. According to my analysis of the actual experiments of various oral medications, only the latest chemical therapy "New Kelinon" (available in Chinese and English) can be used as an oral agent to directly deliver bactericidal power to the lesion and eliminate all gonococci. Because "New Kelinon" is a chemical therapy for gonorrhea, it specifically eliminates gonococci, and it is very different from general chemical therapies, which have very strong reactions and are not purely effective. Originally, this "New Kelinon" was invented by Dr. Peter of Germany and has been proven by many experts in various countries that this drug can cure all new and old gonorrhea. For external use, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used to wash the urethra according to the diagram, which is even more effective.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The Harm of Incompletely Cured Gonorrhea</p>
<p>I have been treating gonorrhea for more than twenty years. For gonorrhea, if the patient can completely trust my treatment method, I will do my best to treat it completely and fundamentally until it is cured, and I will never perform an incomplete and perfunctory treatment to shirk responsibility. However, in general, patients are often impatient, thinking that I can achieve great results in a few days, and thinking that the disease has subsided, they no longer come to me for treatment. As a result, the gonorrhea that was about to be cured falls short, and it recurs. Not only is all previous effort wasted, but the disease is more severe than before. Patients often come back to ask me for treatment. Although I can still be responsible for the radical cure, the treatment time is inevitably extended. In terms of treatment methods, all unreasonable treatments should be discarded, and the most scientific treatment methods should be used to completely eliminate the gonococci in the chronic phase from the deep and widespread areas, leaving no disease behind to avoid recurrence. To achieve this goal of complete cure, only the great invention of the gonorrhea-specific drug "New Kelinon" (available in Chinese and English) and German inductive electrostatic therapy, X-ray therapy, can fundamentally eradicate it. Because the bactericidal power of "New Kelinon" can follow the circulation of the blood to sweep away the gonococci scattered in the body, the gonococci have no way to gain a foothold in our body, and the problem is fundamentally solved. Furthermore, prompt surgery is used to correct the pathological condition, which can achieve the task of complete cure. Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and sexual neurasthenia.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Pulmonary disease is also called a rich man's disease, because this disease is extremely difficult to cure, and it consumes the patient's economy and physical strength for a long time. If one can withstand the invasion of this bacterium and has the economic power to support it, then this wasting disease is not without hope of a complete cure. Usually, living in a sanatorium is considered the best way to deal with this disease, but this kind of treatment is at least affordable for the average petit bourgeois. The lower classes are mostly unable to afford it. Fortunately, a new method of self-treatment at home has now been invented, that is, taking the pulmonary tuberculosis-specific drug "Pulmonary Nall" invented by Dr. Tume, a German pulmonary disease expert, which can completely cure all stages of pulmonary disease, such as early or second and third stage pulmonary disease. Because "Pulmonary Nall" has the function of directly eliminating tuberculosis bacteria and repairing lung cavities. Those who experience tidal fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, unsmooth sputum expectoration, and poor appetite can all achieve results in a short period of time. It is indeed a divine product for family self-treatment of pulmonary disease.</p>

<h3>French Defense Force and Police Yesterday Evacuated Xujiahui; Japan-puppet Regime and French Side Reached an Agreement Through Negotiations; General Order Within the Town is Still Considered Stable</h3>
<p>Before the war, Xujiahui Town in western Shanghai was under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. After the westward retreat of the national army, the French Concession authorities, because the area had a refugee zone and because the French Catholic Church owned a great deal of property in the area, dispatched troops to be stationed there and temporarily set up a police station at the intersection of Ciyou Road and Huizhan Street in the town. They distributed posts at important locations to maintain order, under the administration of the French Concession. For more than two years, they lived in peace. Moreover, because the location was remote and there were not many residents, many factories and institutions moved there during the time when the concession was crowded with people. Therefore, the area actually had the function of regulating the population in the concession, which indirectly helped maintain law and order in the concession. However, the Japan-puppet regime's military police suddenly invaded the area the day before yesterday, causing rumors to arise and people to panic. The situation was quite tense. As seen in yesterday's newspaper, according to further investigation, the French Concession authorities have reached a compromise with the Japan-puppet regime, and starting from 1:00 AM this morning, the area will be handed over to the Japan-puppet regime. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brewing for a Long Time, Agreement Recently Reached</p>
<p>Recently, the Japan-puppet side, using the excuse that there were no more refugees in the area, demanded that the French side withdraw the defense force and police station. It is reported that this negotiation has been conducted between the French Concession authorities and the puppet "municipal government" for many days. Until yesterday, it was completely resolved. The French side, due to the harsh environment and unwillingness to cause disputes, expressed concessions and, starting from 12:00 last night, withdrew the defense force and police station to within the concession. Starting from 1:00 AM this morning, it was handed over to the Japan-puppet side to take over. According to the Japanese military spokesman at a reception for reporters last night, he also admitted that "this issue will be resolved today (i.e., tomorrow)," but he was unwilling to release the details. However, the French Concession authorities and the Japanese embassy spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it.</p>
<p>Residents Hearing the News, Moved One After Another</p>
<p>Since the Japan-puppet regime's military police invaded the area the day before yesterday, yesterday morning, the Japanese army held exercises nearby again. The general residents, because they were worried about what kind of situation would arise, were greatly panicked and moved one after another. Although it rained heavily yesterday afternoon, the number of people moving actually increased. On the various roads in Xujiahui, boxes and vehicles were connected endlessly, all soaked in rainwater. The general residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, all fled towards the concession, whispering to each other, showing a look of panic. As for the temporary police station of the French Concession in the area, after moving the documents and equipment out all night the day before yesterday, only empty houses remained yesterday.</p>
<p>Iron Wire Erected at the Border</p>
<p>The intersection of Haig Road, Avenue Petain, and Xujiahui Road has always been the only thoroughfare between Xujiahui Town and the French Concession. Yesterday, the area was erected with barbed wire by the Japan-puppet regime's military police, leaving only a five-foot-long gap for the entry and exit of trams and pedestrians. However, there were no Japan-puppet personnel stationed at the gap yesterday, so residents were still able to enter and exit freely. As for Haig Road, there were originally two lines of barbed wire, one adjacent to the Chinese area and one in the middle of the concession, which was the road. Now, the barbed wire adjacent to the Chinese area has been completely removed by the Japan-puppet personnel, and even the wooden poles have been pulled out.</p>
<p>Observatory Still Working as Usual</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory in the Xujiahui area is an important place for reporting and observing weather in the Far East. In the future, when all the French police detectives are withdrawn, the work of the observatory is of great concern to the shipping industry. According to inquiries, the observatory worked as usual yesterday and will not be suspended in the future. The weather station and other facilities there cannot be moved, and it has been decided to continue working at the original location. In addition, the Xujiahui Catholic Church, seminary, monastery, and bishop's residence are also not preparing to move.</p>
<p>Situation in the Town Still Considered Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese military trucks and Japan-puppet military police came and went in Xujiahui Town from time to time. Although many residents were uneasy, the general order was still considered stable. Xuhui Middle School, Xuhui Girls' High School, Qiming Girls' High School, and other schools all had classes as usual yesterday. The Xujiahui French Catholic Church is still safe, and most shops are also open for business as usual. However, at about 2:00 PM yesterday, when it was raining heavily, the extremely long bamboo fence of the Xuhui shelter was suddenly completely demolished by hundreds of poor people and taken back for fuel. Although the Chinese police were stationed beside them, they only watched to avoid causing trouble.</p>
<p>Security Strengthened in the Border Area of the Concession</p>
<p>In order to maintain the tranquility of the western district, the French Concession police authorities specially dispatched a large number of detectives yesterday, distributed at the intersections of Haig Road leading into the concession, and the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles was very strict. At the end of Xujiahui Road, which was blocked by barbed wire by the Japan-puppet regime, there was an armored vehicle and many detectives stationed at the gap, with extremely tight defenses. French police and Annamite police were rarely found in Xujiahui Town yesterday, but White Russian and Chinese police were still maintaining order in various places in the town. There was a rumor locally that there would be a retreat last night, but it could not be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Italian Consul Going North; Danish Consul Temporarily Serves as Leader of the Consular Corps</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and leader of the Consular Corps in this city, Mr. Niro, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 25th for a three-week vacation in Beidaihe. The Danish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Hill, will temporarily serve as the leader of the Consular Corps. The post of Italian Consul General will be temporarily held by Mr. Leibeks, an official of the Italian Consulate's court, until Mr. Niro returns to office.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Refugees Awaiting Repatriation in Nanshi is Miserable; Charitable Lottery Tickets are Issued as Usual</h3>
<p>The refugees in the Nanshi Refugee Zone, except for the old and weak who were transferred to the Xin Puyu Hall for accommodation, will all be given a month's worth of alms at the end of this month and repatriated. The Rehabilitation Committee of the District has already announced this to all the refugees in the district. It is reported that there are mostly women and children among the refugees in the district, mostly poor households from the suburbs of Shanghai and those who have lived in Nanshi for a long time. One-fifth of the refugees are from distant places. Since Father Jacquinot left Shanghai and the refugee zone is preparing to close, all the refugees in the district feel deeply at a loss, especially the refugees from distant places, who have a feeling of not knowing where to turn. The miserable situation is particularly pitiful. The Charity Lottery, which is the only economic source for the refugee zone, has been decided by the company authorities not to be suspended due to the closure of the refugee zone, because two or three charitable organizations are currently relying on the surplus funds from the lottery for subsidies. At the same time, in these extraordinary times, when the municipal finances are difficult, funds are needed for street beggars and homeless refugees to ensure their well-being. Therefore, it has been decided to continue issuing and making appropriate allocations to increase local public welfare.</p>
<h3>Converting Tribute Rice from Saigon to Hong Kong, then Shipping to Shanghai; Cutting off Transportation is Absolutely Not True; Food Committee to Hold Important Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Food Committee established by the Municipal Council is scheduled to hold a committee meeting at 2:15 PM today. The members of the committee are Marshall (Chairman), Iveley, Grand, Hongk, Hedden, Li Wenzie, Megg, Sugimura. According to a reporter from the New Life News Agency, a certain member of the committee said that today's meeting will discuss how to stabilize the prices of rice and flour and how to dredge the sources of foreign rice and wheat. Once a solution is decided, opinions on this issue will be submitted to the board of directors of the Municipal Council. The meeting notice has already been issued. The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has ordered another 20,000 bags of rice from Saigon for the fourth phase of price stabilization, in addition to the 15,000 bags previously stored. The cost of each bag (broken rice) is 54 yuan, excluding all expenses. Three-tenths of the deposit has been paid, totaling 324,000 yuan. The remaining 40,000 bags will be ordered as soon as the deposit is secured. After the additional 20,000 bags arrive in Shanghai around July 15, price stabilization will be launched. Yesterday, the Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association reiterated the previous order, restricting the weighing and clearing of rice and grain within ten days of the transaction.</p>
<p>The rice problem in this city has recently become serious again. Domestic rice has exceeded the 70 yuan mark, and foreign rice has also exceeded 60 yuan. The livelihood of the poor is worrying. The source of domestic rice is entirely controlled by the Japan-puppet regime. The amount of rice arriving in Shanghai every day cannot be investigated. The foreign rice is shipped from Saigon, Rangoon, Bangkok, and other ports in Vietnam. The soaring rice prices in this city are primarily due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the deliberate increase in prices. The Concession authorities had previously set a price limit of 40 yuan, but in reality, it has already been hovering around the 50 yuan mark. After holding on for several months, unexpectedly, the weather was extremely dry a few days ago, and the armistice between France and Germany caused rumors to spread in Vietnam, which gave speculators a great opportunity to spread rumors, saying that tribute rice could not be shipped to Shanghai and that the transshipment of foreign rice in Hong Kong was also prevented from being exported, etc., which repeatedly and drastically increased rice prices, creating unprecedented new prices. The livelihood of ordinary people cannot be maintained. According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the rice directly shipped from Saigon, Rangoon, and Siam has indeed been very little, but the rice shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment to Shanghai is continuous. Last week, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yisheng, Yisheng, and Lisheng lines shipped more than 51,400 sentences. On Saturday, the Taikoo Dockyard Company's Guangdong Wheel shipped 20,008 bags. On Sunday (the 23rd), the Xinjiang Wheel loaded another 11,774 bags, so the source will definitely not be interrupted. It is reported that the Java Company's Shibosha wheel is scheduled to ship rice directly from Saigon to Shanghai today. In addition, due to the recent rain, the five grains are expected to have a bumper harvest, and the old rice in the countryside is being milled one after another. Rice prices fell yesterday, but flour mills have increased their factory price to 14 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Rice Famine in Xiaoshao is Getting Worse; Xiangshan Reports Famine</h3>
<p>The rice famine in Xiaoshao has been getting worse recently. The Xiaoshao Disaster Relief Association in this city received a telegram from the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Labor Union, Education Association, Women's Association, and other county-wide legal entities at 5:00 AM yesterday (the 24th), saying, "All of you are concerned about our homeland and have bestowed rescue. We are deeply grateful. The food famine has become more severe recently. In addition to doing our best to adjust and provide relief, we sincerely request that you quickly raise large sums of money for rescue. We are in dire straits." It is learned that the association has remitted 120,000 yuan to Shao yesterday and sent Wang Qingyun, Hong Wuqi, Chen Yinru, and others to purchase and distribute rice. It is also reported that the association is scheduled to hold a Xiaoshao Disaster Relief Fundraising Conference at the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai on Avenue Edward VII today. It is believed that the people of Shao are deeply concerned about their homeland and will definitely participate enthusiastically and donate large sums of money. In addition, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association received an express mail from the Xiangshan County Government yesterday, saying, "Our county has never had enough rice, but we have been able to support ourselves by supplementing it with miscellaneous grains such as wheat, silk, etc. Last year's flood caused a disaster, and the late rice harvest was poor. It has been difficult to maintain the food supply for the entire county. However, neighboring counties, seeing that the prices in our county are lower, have come to purchase, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been extremely dry, and the fields have cracked. About two-thirds of the early rice has not been sown in time. Even those that have been sown have withered seedlings, and it is difficult to expect a harvest. The disaster is already apparent. At present, there is no rice for sale, and tragic events of seizing grain, cutting off food, starving to death, and committing suicide are occurring frequently. According to investigations, Ru Yuyang Lai Aqiao in the west township committed suicide by drinking poisonous herbs because he had many family members, could not afford rice, and had no way to make a living. Zhou Songlai, a family of six in Xiangsi Ling in the east township, cut off food for three days, and his wife and children cried and screamed, secretly drinking brine and committing suicide. Sun Heding's family of five in Banana Sun in the west township cut off food for many days, and one son and one daughter starved to death one after another. Villagers in Zhuang Wu in Xisi Temple, Hutou in the east township, seized more than 100 jin of grain.</p>
<p>Tragic events are occurring frequently. Others, such as abandoning daughters and selling children, are unable to continue eating and prolong their lives by eating grass roots and bark. This is even more common everywhere. The severity of the food panic is actually greater than in the counties of Yong. We should ask your association to consider the people of Yong and provide relief to them as a whole, so as to relieve the disaster and appease our homeland. We are looking forward to it." It is heard that the association has telegraphed to Yong to request allocation.</p>
<h3>British Nationals in This City are Deeply Patriotic; Urge Return to Homeland to Serve; French People Demonstrate in Front of British Consulate in Saigon; Demand that Britain Adhere to the Allied Pledge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a British national sent a letter to the North China Daily News, calling for British nationals in this city to intensify their work and serve their motherland. The letter stated, "According to yesterday's news reports, some British territories and colonies have begun conscription, but this city has never allowed overseas Chinese to leave their professions and concentrate on serving their country. There were rumors here that this city is about to begin recruiting volunteers to enlist in the army, but I believe that this action should be changed to active encouragement so that all those who have reached the age of military service should enlist immediately. At present, there is a great need for a large amount of manpower, and the more people serve their country, the greater the effectiveness of protecting their country. However, Shanghai is not only lagging behind in manpower, but also in material donations. In the past few months, British overseas Chinese all over the world have donated huge sums of money to their country, but the amount donated in Shanghai is still small. British overseas Chinese in this city should also intensify this work. The North China Daily News can be responsible for carrying out fundraising and publicity work in order to achieve great results."</p>
<p>French People in Saigon Demonstrate and March</p>
<p>Foreigners in this city received a radio report from the British Broadcasting Corporation's radio station the night before last, saying that French residents in Saigon held a demonstration in front of the British Consulate General in Saigon, demanding that Britain adhere to its pledge to unite with France and requesting permission for them to immediately enlist in the army and join the Allied forces. The demonstration and march only ended when the British Consul General gave a speech to the crowd on the balcony, guaranteeing that their demands would be submitted to the British government.</p>
<p>Jewish People Pray to Avert Misfortune</p>
<p>The Jewish people in this city received a notice from Dr. Kislev, Chairman of the Far Eastern Jewish Federation in Harbin, that they will fast from dawn tomorrow until half an hour after sunset and hold prayers to avert the misfortune of the Jewish people in Europe. During this period, the Jewish people in this city will fast for one day and recite the Bible and hold prayers at 6:00 PM tomorrow at the Jewish Synagogue at No. 50 Museum Road.</p>
<p>Real Situation of Cholera</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's health report, one person contracted cholera in the week before midnight on the 22nd and died immediately, but the person had no fixed address. Two people suffered from choleraic diarrhea and both died.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Market" Merged</h3>
<p>Shanghai Foodstuffs Market One, which is presided over by a certain party, and the "Shanghai Central Market," which is presided over by the puppet party, are trending towards an antagonistic position. The daily turnover of the "Central Market" has dropped from about 40,000 yuan to just over 10,000 yuan. It is now heard that after mediation by a certain party's "special service agency," the "Foodstuffs Market" announced yesterday that it would move into the "Central Market" from the 24th and operate as usual. In fact, it is a merger in name and in reality.</p>

<h3>American Consul Packer Said, Protect Far Eastern Interests; Washington Authorities Determine Effective Measures</h3>
<p>The Tianjin silver issue, the UK and Japan actually reached a compromise, followed by France also accepted the Japanese demands, and stopped China's cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway international passage. What followed was that Japan threatened Hong Kong again and demanded the same treatment on the cargo transportation of the Burma Road. Chinese parties expressed extreme regret for the concessions made by Britain and France, and they are extremely concerned about the US Far Eastern policy. The Pyeongmin News reporter specifically inquired about this matter at the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. According to Administrative Consul Packer of the consulate, the US policy on the Far East will remain unchanged." The reporter further asked how the US would protect its interests in the Far East, as the current US interests in the Far East are obviously being discriminated against and threatened by the Far East aggressors. Packer replied, "The US government will of course protect its interests in the Far East, and the US authorities in Washington will have their own ways to protect them." The reporter asked again about the exact date of Ambassador Johnson's departure from Chongqing. Packer said, "The US Consulate has not yet received a specific date for the ambassador's arrival in Shanghai."</p>
<p>US Warship Movements</p>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that the USS Pecos, a supply ship of the US Asiatic Fleet, left Qin Huangdao a few days ago after carrying a team of US Marines who had completed their training back to Shanghai. It remained moored until 2:00 PM today (the 24th) and then set sail for Manila. It is heard that the USS Marblehead, a light cruiser of the US Asiatic Fleet, will leave Shanghai this week, or on the 25th, and sail to Qingdao, as usual, to cruise the ports of North China in the summer.</p>
<h3>Carrying Legal Tender to Border Provinces; Ban Cancelled; Travel from Kunming to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin and Other Places is Still Limited to 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously formulated measures to prevent the import of special goods by land, sea, and air in order to prevent capital flight and maintain the safety of the exchange market. It stipulated that the transport of gold and silver, gold and silver products, and banknotes to border provinces and borders, or the transport of such items from border provinces and borders to the interior, should be subject to strict restrictions. This measure was approved by the ministry and notified to travelers by the Executive Yuan. Subsequently, in order to strictly restrict the transport of banknotes, the Ministry of Finance separately formulated measures to restrict the export of banknotes, designating (1) that the transport of banknotes from Kunming to Hong Kong, or from the interior through Kunming, Hekou, Hong Kong, and other places to Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, is limited to 500 yuan per person; (2) that the transport of banknotes from Hekou to Lao Cai should not exceed 20 yuan per person, and that the transport of banknotes from the interior through Hekou to Shanghai and other Chinese places is still limited to 500 yuan per person; (3) that the transport of banknotes from Tengchong to Bhamo is limited to 200 yuan per person; (4) that the transport of banknotes from Kunming or other places to Hekou is limited to 500 yuan; and (5) that the transport of legal tender abroad or to guerrilla areas from the interior is limited to Jiangbai yuan per person, except for those subject to special restrictions. This special project was also approved and telegraphed for implementation. Since the implementation of these measures, people have inevitably been restricted by these regulations when carrying legal tender to the hinterland. The closure will confine legal tender to a small corner. After careful verification, the Ministry of Finance believes that it is inconsistent with the meaning of the regulations and has made changes to the method of transporting banknotes. Except for the transport of gold and silver, gold and silver products, and banknotes out of the country, which should still be handled in accordance with the limited amount stipulated by the ministry, the transport of banknotes from the interior to various border provinces for circulation within the country, which does not involve export, should not be subject to restrictions on the amount, so that both the restriction on the export of legal tender and the need for circulation in various parts of the country can be taken into account. This changed method has been approved by the Executive Yuan and notified.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wenzhou Italian Ships Changed to Yueqing; Italian Consulate Has Approved</h3>
<p>It is now learned that as a result of the request from shipping merchants, the Italian Consulate has approved the change of ships to Yueqing near Wenzhou. The Baoli Wheel has decided to leave Shanghai as scheduled tomorrow (the 26th), loading cargo and passengers. Inquiries can be made at the ship's office on Beijing Road. In addition, the Italian ship Maberilia Wheel has also decided to change to Yueqing. Other German-Central commercial ships will still operate as usual. The Changde and Deping wheels are also operating normally between Shanghai and Ningbo without any changes.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Group Life Insurance; Lawyer Zhang Li's Opinion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued a circular to its members to solicit their approval of group life insurance and their opinions on the outline. According to lawyer Zhang Li's opinion, "I, as a member, am extremely in favor of the principle, but I dare not agree with the sentence 'death due to natural causes' in the first clause of the outline. (1) Everyone cherishes life and fears death. No one would attempt to commit suicide or arson for the sake of a thousand yuan insurance payout and equate such things with the same thing. Even if one is unfortunate enough to commit suicide, the pain is even greater than living in the world, and one has no choice but to resort to this last resort. One's situation is already pitiful. Why can't one be given compensation? In other cases, such as those who die in the line of duty (such as Judge Yu) or those who resist violence to the death, even if they are not members of this association, we should express our sympathy. How can we be members of this association, who have paid insurance premiums, and confiscate their insurance benefits? In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from being unworthy of death, this association should make arrangements in advance, or even refuse their insurance application to show restrictions. Therefore, according to my humble opinion, those who die should be given insurance benefits regardless of whether it is natural or accidental, in order to conform to the original intention of this association in handling life insurance."</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of Things; The Traces of Prosperity and Decline are Fleeting; Continental Press Reporter's Impressions of Europe; Franco-German Armistice is Reciprocal Revenge; The Root of Future Disaster Has Already Been Conceived</h3>
<p>When the news of the Franco-German armistice spread to Shanghai, Mr. Luo Xiaote, an editor of the Continental Press who had traveled in Europe for two and a half years, suddenly returned to Shanghai from the United States, resumed his duties at the office, and published his interesting text, saying, "When Hitler ordered the historic carriage in which the 1918 armistice was signed to be brought back to Berlin, he had already conceived the embryo of another war between Germany and France in the next 50 to 500 years. The French have a memory, and they will never forget anything. They will obtain compensation for any mistake before it is over. In this respect, the French have the spirit of the Chinese. In the past two years, I have traveled between Paris and Berlin, and I have often been filled with nostalgia.</p>
<p>The Palace of Versailles is Deserted</p>
<p>When we passed Versailles, we visited various places of historical interest and visited the Palace of Versailles. Although the palace was deserted, the paintings on the walls were hung as before, and no one dared to destroy them. Among them is the Hall of Mirrors, where the peace conference was held in 1919. The guards in the hall painstakingly pointed out and narrated to us which was the seat of US President Wilson and which were the seats of the German and French representatives.</p>
<p>The Franco-Prussian War was Signed Here</p>
<p>I was quite surprised why the peace conference of the European War was held in this empty and desolate Palace of Versailles instead of in Paris. I asked the guard, and the guard said, "I would like to tell you the reason. The reason why the peace conference was held in the Hall of Mirrors is that this is where the Prussian king forced us to end the Franco-Prussian War and sign the armistice in 1871."</p>
<p>The Same Dining Car; Old Drama Reenacted</p>
<p>He also told me that the long table where the peace conference was held was completely placed in its original place and had not been moved. Now, Hitler is forcing the French to make peace in the same dining car, because this car is where the French repelled the Germans in 1918. However, Mr. Xi is afraid that the French will repeat the old tune in the future and change their minds repeatedly, so he is preventing it in advance and taking the carriage back to Berlin.</p>
<p>German War Booty; The French Demand its Return</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, after visiting Paris, I returned to Berlin and met a German who was about to go to southeastern Germany to join a tank unit. I visited the Linden Memorial to Unknown Heroes with him, and on a platform near a fountain, I found an old-fashioned ammunition transport car. There was a copper plate on the car, and my friend translated its meaning, saying, "The guns on this car are war trophies obtained by the Prussian army in France in 1871. In 1919, at the time of the Paris peace conference, the French had requested the return of the guns, but they were especially preserved in this car. Now, when Hitler is in a whirlwind of activity, will this car in Linden still demand that the French return its guns? If so, then we can believe that in the next war, if the French win, they will definitely demand the return of their guns and empty cars to Paris."</p>
<h3>Banks Engaging in Speculative Business; Ministry Orders Prohibition; Banks Should Set an Example; Employees Should Especially Abide by the Regulations</h3>
<p>After the influx of floating capital into Shanghai, speculation has become rampant. It is heard that various commercial banks are using deposits to not only hoard goods but also buy foreign exchange with all their might, ostensibly "protecting deposits" but actually trying to make a fortune from the national crisis. Bank employees, from managers to trainees, are all engaged in speculation, competing to buy foreign exchange and hoard goods, causing social unrest. In addition, many bank employees are buying foreign exchange on behalf of their relatives and friends. Banks themselves and their employees were originally prohibited from engaging in speculative transactions. Now, after obtaining confidential information, the Ministry of Finance has strictly ordered an investigation and prohibition, and ordered that they refuse to underwrite the longest-term mortgages on daily necessities in order to avoid fueling speculation and affecting people's livelihood. Bank employees should abide by the regulations, and banks themselves should set an example in order to prevent malpractice.</p>
<h3>Punishment of Unmarked Stalls Will Not Be Neglected</h3>
<p>The Shanhaiguan Road, Xinzha vegetable market stalls numbered 6, 9, 10, 60, 68, 207, 221, 311, and 325, involving nine individuals, were found to have never complied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations to display prices. After investigation by the Council and prosecution in court, each was fined ten yuan on the 21st of this month. Furthermore, the American Vegetable Company (transliterated) at 1253 Jing'an Temple Road was found to be using inaccurate weighing equipment. After investigation and prosecution in court, a fine of thirty yuan was imposed on the same day. Meng Zunting, at 36 Yuanchang Road, was found by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department to be selling unapproved milk. After investigation and prosecution in court, he was fined twenty yuan as a warning on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Italians Reside Peacefully in Both Concessions</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Daguang News Agency's inquiry with the Italian Mail Steamship Company, the Conte Verde has been ordered to cease operations and berth in Shanghai. There has been a proposal to convert it into a floating hotel. However, due to the appropriate docking location not yet being determined, the aforementioned hotel conversion work has not yet commenced. Furthermore, the Italian expatriate population in this city is not large, totaling only about 650 people, residing in both concessions without any unrest. Although the Italian Consulate General has notified expatriates to restrain their behavior to avoid misunderstandings with British and French expatriates, the authorities in both concessions continue to provide protection to the Italian expatriates. Therefore, the Italian expatriates continue to reside as usual, and the relationships are extremely harmonious. Thus, relocating to ships is, in fact, unnecessary at present.</p>
<h3>Barter System of the Trade Commission Builds Creditworthiness, the United States Expresses Trust and Proposes Continued Loans, HSBC Annual Meeting Calls It Economic Progress</h3>
<p>The Trade Commission has successively signed barter loan agreements with friendly nations, such as tea from the Soviet Union and tung oil and bristles from the United States. The commission pays off the barter goods and loans in full and on time, maintaining the country's external credit. It has won international praise. For example, because China can fulfill its obligations and deliver the goods as scheduled, American congressmen have proposed continuing loans to China. HSBC praised China's economic situation this year at its annual meeting, which is more advanced than last year. This shows a glimpse of foreign opinion. Therefore, the work of the commission, from the perspective of economic resistance, is indeed an important force, laying the economic foundation of the country.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Lines Eliminate Gratuities</h3>
<p>Since Ningbo restricted the export of passengers, the number of passengers in and out of Shanghai and Ningbo has decreased sharply. The De Ping and other ships operating on this line have decided to waive the gratuities for tea rooms and bars to reduce the burden on passengers and eliminate bad practices.</p>
<h3>Relief for Shanghai West Fire Refugees</h3>
<p>The fire in Tiandu Village, Anhe Temple Road, Shanghai West, destroyed more than a dozen shanty houses the day before yesterday. The Buddhist Philanthropic Association sent staff to investigate the disaster yesterday. It was found that twelve families were affected, totaling seventy-three people, especially the five families of Cao Guangshou, Zhang Kunshan, Tang Xicheng, Liu Changde, and Yan Kuan, who were the most distressed. They were unable to rebuild shacks and have been living outdoors for days, which is extremely miserable. In addition to issuing more than 800 congee tickets at any time, the association also funded each of the disaster victims to build a shanty house to provide shelter.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Case of Li Yuying's Sudden Death, Coffin Opened for Examination Yesterday, Hospital Authorities Conceal Report, Deceased's Parents Unaware</h3>
<p>Li Yuying, also known as Li Jieru, daughter of Li Shizhen, a Fujianese elderly man in his seventies residing at No. 74, Lane 41, Tao'erfeisi Road in the French Concession, was 31 years old this year, had received higher education, and held celibacy. She had been the head nurse at the Sino-Western Sanatorium at No. 536 Pushi Road for six years. The director of the hospital, Lu Zhong'an, is from Beiping. Lu's son, Lu Zhenqing, 39 years old, serves as the office manager in the hospital. The hospital is a sanatorium, with both Chinese and Western doctors available to provide treatment according to the wishes of the patients. Because Li Yuying had worked in the hospital for a long time, she lived in the hospital, regarding it as her second home. She kept her savings, money, and clothing in the hospital and occasionally returned home to visit her parents. Her family are Christian believers. Li Yuying returned home on the evening of the Dragon Boat Festival this month to visit her parents, and returned to the hospital to sleep at night. When she said goodbye to her family at home, she was happy and showed no abnormality. Unexpectedly, Yuying returned to the hospital that night and died suddenly. It was not until 11 a.m. the next morning that Li Konglan, Li's niece, came to the hospital to give Yuying an injection. She knocked hard on the door and called out, but there was no response. After Lu Zhenqing, the hospital's office manager, took the key to open the door and enter the room, he discovered that Li Yuying had already died, and her body was cold. After discovering Li Yuying's sudden death, the hospital authorities notified the family members to come, but did not report it to the police according to the regulations of the concession hospital. Instead, Lu Zhenqing, the hospital's office manager, ordered the hospital's doctor, Lin Zhengliang, to be responsible for issuing a death certificate stating that Li Yuying died of apoplexy (stroke), and notified the Haige Road Chinese Funeral Home to transport the body to the funeral home. Lu Zhenqing, on behalf of the family, took out a portion of the funds from the deceased's savings to purchase high-quality Western-style clothing and a coffin, placed the body in the coffin, and temporarily placed the coffin in the funeral home. While searching for a burial site in the Hongqiao Cemetery and planning to bury the body on a selected date, a person</p>
<p>named Lei Huayun sent letters to the French Police Department, the Special Second Court, and the Fujianese Association in Shanghai, recounting the unclear death of Li Yuying and requesting justice and a thorough investigation to redress the grievances of the deceased. After receiving the letter, the French Police Department sent investigators to the Sino-Western Sanatorium and the Chinese Funeral Home to investigate. Both claimed that the deceased died of a stroke and had no definite evidence. Further investigation of the deceased's family did not reveal the cause of Li Yuying's death. Therefore, the police ordered the coffin to be sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Examination Office for examination. Yesterday morning, the deceased's parents, Li Shizhen and Li Linshi, the office manager of the Sino-Western Sanatorium, Lu Zhenqing, the doctor Lin Zhengliang, and the staff of the Chinese Funeral Home who handled the matter were summoned to the case. Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor appointed by the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Second Court, and the forensic medical officer, etc., arrived at the autopsy site to open the coffin and examine the body. Because the Fujianese Association in Shanghai received a report from Lei Huayun, it sent Xu Shaoshan, the director of public relations of the association, to the scene to observe the examination. The worker</p>
<p>opened the coffin lid and took out the body for examination. The body had undergone surgery at the funeral home and had been given an antiseptic injection. The face turned black, and the skin and flesh of the whole body were tight and hard. External examination did not reveal the exact cause of death. The prosecutor asked Lin Zhengliang, who replied that he was a doctor at the Sino-Western Sanatorium, and he did not know the truth about the death of the deceased. Lu Zhenqing ordered me to issue a death certificate stating that she died of a stroke. When questioned Lu Zhenqing, he also prevaricated and shifted the responsibility to the family of the deceased. The deceased's father, Li Shizhen, said that he did not know the cause of his daughter's death at the time, and everything was handled by Lu Zhenqing. The deceased's mother, Li Linshi, said that her daughter left 6,700 yuan in cash and jewelry, all of which were in the hospital, and requested that they be returned. When questioned Lu Zhenqing, he said that the deceased had 7,000 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, and more than 200 pieces of clothing of various styles stored in the hospital. He originally wanted to return them to the family of the deceased. According to a report from the investigators, the certificate signed by Dr. Lin is currently in the Health Department. According to the family of the deceased, Lu Zhenqing even promised the family to continue to pay the deceased's salary of 300 yuan per month. There is also a written request drafted by Lu Zhenqing for the family to ask the hospital to waive the autopsy, which is now in the hospital, etc. Zhao the prosecutor and the forensic doctor checked the confession and reprimanded Lu Lin for</p>
<p>concealing the sudden death of the person without reporting it to the police and for issuing a certificate randomly to the funeral home for burial. It was also suspected that the death of the deceased was suspicious and required a detailed investigation to make it clear and prevent any injustice. Therefore, the case was left for the police department to continue the investigation before further verification, or the body would be dissected for examination. Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang were suspected of being heavily responsible and were taken back to the police station by the investigators for investigation. The coffin will still be temporarily stored at the autopsy site, or it may need to be dissected for examination.</p>
<h3>American Davis Robbed in Hongkou, Stops Rickshaw Puller, Robbed of 180 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that an American, Davis, was robbed of 180 yuan in cash by eight bandits when he was traveling by rickshaw on Youheng Road early yesterday morning (the 24th). According to Davis's report to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, he was riding in a rickshaw on Youheng Road outside the boundary of the Public Concession at about 12:45 a.m. Bandits suddenly rushed out from the dark. Two of them stopped the rickshaw puller, and the rest grabbed Davis's arms on both sides of the rickshaw. Without saying a word, they immediately searched and robbed him, and quietly fled after robbing his money bag. Davis immediately shouted loudly to alert the police, but the "Avenue" police could not find any trace of them, so he went to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to report. However, it is not known what accent the bandits spoke, so it is not easy for the police to start the investigation.</p>
<h3>A Certain Party Establishes a "Relief Association" to Manage Shanghai West Gambling Dens, the Property of Each Gambling Den Belongs to the "Association"</h3>
<p>According to information obtained by the Shewen News Agency reporter, there is a very big reason for this, which is that a certain party reached an agreement with the gambling table owners to form a "Relief Association." It was agreed that half of the income and surplus of each gambling den would be used to fund the "Association," and that all the privately owned properties of each gambling den would be transferred to the "Association" for management as "Association" property. The "Association" would send "staff" to be stationed in each gambling den to audit all expenses and supervise everything. At that time, the gambling dens fully recognized the above conditions, partly because they could still make profits, and partly because they were surrounded by dozens of staff members who came up with ideas. They also slightly modified the current situation of each gambling den. It is reported that Hollywood reopened yesterday, and several other gambling dens such as Monte Carlo will also reorganize in the next few days.</p>
<h3>The Female Boss of Huanlong Bathhouse Was Lured and Sold into Prostitution, Tricked of Huge Sums of Money and Defiled, Rogue Liang Lianqiao Punished and Fined</h3>
<p>Mao Shoushan, a native of Danyang, has been running the Huanlong Bathhouse at No. 122 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. His business has been thriving recently, and he has accumulated a lot of wealth. His wife, Zhu, named Fengying, is 23 years old this year and has some beauty. She has been cohabiting with Mao. In April of this year, Zhu suddenly met Liang Lianqiao, a rogue from Jiangbei. They went to the Zhejiang Grand Theatre to watch a movie together. At that time, Liang learned that her family was wealthy, so he used his</p>
<p>silver tongue to lie that he had a steel factory in Tianjin with huge capital, and incited her to abandon her husband and run away with him to Tianjin to live a good life. Zhu was so bewitched by his sweet words that she not only had illicit relations with Liang at the Qinghe Hotel on Zhejiang Road that night, but also eloped with Liang on May 14, taking away her clothes and 5,000 yuan in cash. They met Liang at the Hu Ning Hotel on Jie Road and took the train to Tianjin together. They lived together at the Tianjin Hotel in Beikou for three days. Liang used his tricks to get all of Zhu's cash</p>
<p>, and sold her to Liu Shizhen's brothel in Shunde Li for 700 yuan to work as a prostitute. Liang took the money and returned to Shanghai, living comfortably in room 529 of the Oriental Hotel. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the detectives of the Xinzha Police Station, who arrested Liang at the Oriental Hotel, seized 2,000 yuan in cash and a 1,000 yuan fixed deposit certificate from the Shanghai Bank, and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, they sent Liang Lianqiao to the First Special Court Criminal Second Court along with Mao Shoushan, the husband of the victim. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station,</p>
<p>filed a lawsuit according to law and detailed the above situation. According to Mao Shoushan's complaint, his wife recently borrowed 500 yuan from me on the pretext of her brother's wedding, and I gave her 5,000 yuan in legal currency to bring back because the price of farmland in the countryside was cheap. Unexpectedly, she eloped with someone. When Liang was questioned, he confessed everything. Judge Fu sentenced Liang to three years in prison for intending to lure women for profit, and fined him 500 yuan. If the fine is converted into labor service, it will be calculated at two yuan a day. A total of 3,000 yuan in legal currency and deposits seized will be returned to the original owner to receive it.</p>
<h3>High Tide and Heavy Rain, Water Overflowing Roads, Related to Sewer Blockage</h3>
<p>Although yesterday was still the high tide period after the full moon in the lunar calendar, the predicted quantity by the Dredging Bureau was only a little more than ten feet. However, at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, the actual quantity was above eleven feet. Coupled with the torrential rain, the sewers could not discharge the water in time, and the low-lying roads were flooded into canals. The deepest areas were in front of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, and the side of the company on Zhejiang Road, the side of Wing On Company at the south entrance of Nanjing Road, in front of the Times Theatre on Er Ma Road in Daxin Street, the north and south ends of Guangxi Road on Nanjing Road, Yinghua Street on Nanjing Road, the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road, the intersection of Hankou Road and Sichuan Road, the intersection of Alabashito Road and Gansu Road, the intersection of Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road, Sapo Sai Road, and the Bund, etc. The water accumulated to a foot deep in some places, and several inches deep in others, forming a watery world. The combination of high tide and heavy rain yesterday was the biggest reason for the road flooding. Secondly, the road could not discharge the water in time. However, the reason why the road cannot discharge the water in time is also related to the sewer blockage. The recent road flooding in Shanghai is always related to rain, and the recession is very slow, which can be clearly understood, which is not purely caused by the tide flowing backwards from the sewer.</p>
<h3>Tuition Fee Dispute, Lawsuit Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Because the students of Zhendong Primary School, Liu Fengying and Yunying, owed 21 yuan in tuition fees, the principal of the school, Fan Shenxiong, filed a lawsuit with the Special Second Court against the parents of the students, Liu Shusheng, to recover the fees. After the news was first revealed by a reporter from Shewen News Agency, it caused a sensation in society for a while, and many people expressed sympathy. It is now known that the case was originally scheduled for a continued hearing yesterday afternoon, but because the two parties had already reached a settlement outside of court, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared in court yesterday. Only the principal of Zhendong, Fan Shenxiong, submitted a statement to the court, applying for withdrawal of the case. After receiving the statement, the court has approved the withdrawal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Oil Tanker Lost Control in Huangpu River, Zhaofeng Road Also Caught Fire</h3>
<p>The English Da Mei Evening News reported that at 11:50 a.m. today (the 25th), an oil tanker for Japanese military use, berthed in front of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Wharf in Zhoujiazui, Pudong, loaded with oil and paint, suddenly lost control. The oil was flammable and quickly spread. Fortunately, the customs fire boat Puji arrived after hearing the alarm and used fourteen water hoses to pour water to extinguish the fire. Therefore, the fire was controlled within fifteen minutes and did not spread. The cause of the fire is unknown. It is believed that it was caused by carelessly throwing a match or cigarette butt. Also, at 12:10 p.m. today, a box of lump carbolic acid in the Rongsheng Pharmacy at No. 62 Zhaofeng Road exploded due to the heat of the coal stove. The interior of the house was damaged, but fortunately, no one was injured. There was a small fire at the time, which was quickly extinguished.</p>
<h3>British Soldier's Gun Misfires, Bullet Injures Pedestrian's Leg</h3>
<p>At 1:35 p.m. yesterday, a pedestrian, Hua Jinfeng (28 years old), was walking alone between Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road in Shanghai West when suddenly a bullet flew and hit him on the leg. He was injured and fell to the ground immediately. After the patrolman discovered it, he sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the incident, the police investigated the origin of the bullet and found that it was a British soldier who was cleaning his gun when it misfired. It is said that the British authorities intend to punish the soldier who caused the accident.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Xiang Sheng Car</h3>
<p>At 6:50 a.m. yesterday, five customers at the general station of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company on Beijing Road hired a car. The company sent driver Zhang Jinmei to drive a car numbered 18589 to respond. The driver then drove to Dunxin Road, Kaixuan Road in Shanghai West according to the customer's instructions in the car. When they arrived at that location, one of the passengers in the car suddenly pulled out a pistol and ordered the driver to stop. One person took the driver out of the car and escorted him to a small house in a small alley on the side of the road to monitor his actions. The rest of the bandits, seeing that everything was settled, drove the car away and disappeared. After about two hours, the driver was released and reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The lost car was also found by the Haifang Road. The police are investigating what the bandits did by robbing the car.</p>
<h3>The Hardware Industry in This City Has the Most Developed Business, New Shun Tai Has the Highest Profit</h3>
<p>Since last year, all industries in this city have been thriving and making countless profits, and the hardware industry is the most prosperous. It is reported that New Shun Tai alone made a profit of millions. Other firms also made between one and two million. Recently, a rift suddenly developed between the shareholders of New Shun Tai, with differing opinions. A small number of shareholders even attempted to embezzle dividends, which is being mediated by a lawyer.</p>

However, poor people can be issued free certificates at the discretion of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to the news item published on June 24 in the "Local News" section of your newspaper, concerning the "Da Fang Hotel's Occupation of Refugee Donations." The item states that the hotel industry has been collecting refugee donations from guests, but due to certain relationships, it has always allowed guests to donate voluntarily. To prevent malfeasance, it has been stated that any surplus amount remaining after settlement with the refugee association would be donated to other charities. This is not in accordance with the facts. This association has always collected refugee expenses from the hotel industry in accordance with the regulations, and has always collected and paid them in full. The Da Fang Hotel cannot be an exception. If the funds collected in the name of this association could be used freely by the collector, the malfeasance would be unimaginable. This letter is to request a correction in order to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng, Secretary General, Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, June 24</p>

<h3>Bai Ge Piao (Pigeon Lottery)</h3>
<p>Luzon is located in a remote part of the South Seas, a sparse collection of islands. The land is barren, the people are poor, and there are no local products to speak of. In terms of trade volume and the movement of goods by ship, it is like a small witch in the presence of a great wizard compared to other countries. However, its circulating Bai Ge Piao generates huge profits every month. Those involved in selling them say that the method is extremely fair. The drawings determine the winners and losers, with no private abuses. Moreover, all of this is done by the monarch himself, never delegated to others. Therefore, people everywhere win big prizes, but the people in that country are less likely to win, because the country has many poor people, making it difficult to afford tickets, and because the country is poor, there are few buyers. The surplus silver is used to support the widowed, orphaned, and lonely, making it a good law that uses wealth wisely, which is why it can last. Moreover, it can be expanded and extended. A few years ago, there were only 10,000 lottery numbers. Because there were not enough to sell, the number was increased to 12,000, and recently it has been increased to 13,000. In Shanghai alone, there are five sellers. In the past, people suspected that they were acting privately, but recently they have become deeply convinced and are competing to buy them. Initially, Westerners living there sold hundreds of tickets per month, but now Chinese people also sell hundreds of tickets. Those with more money buy the entire number, and those with less money buy half a ticket, or about several people buy it together, so more people win prizes. There are ten small lotteries and two large lotteries throughout the year. For the small lotteries, each ticket costs six yuan, and for the large lotteries, it costs twice as much. In Luzon, it only costs five or ten yuan, but in Shanghai, the ticket is marked up to cover water freight and the profits of the handler, so it is slightly more expensive.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Fifth Column</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>"Fifth Column," "Fifth Column," people all over the world are shuddering at this new term. Whether in Europe, Asia, or the Americas, whether in the belligerent or non-belligerent countries of the European war, this new type of spy army is lurking. England, France, Turkey, and other countries, in order to prevent its clandestine activities, have arrested many nationals and non-nationals. Even the United States, far across the ocean, has felt its terror and allocated $175,000 for the expenses of searching for the Fifth Column.</p>
<p>As early as five years ago, in 1936, when the Spanish revolutionary rebels advanced on Madrid, General Mola of Franco's headquarters announced: "Our army now has four columns of troops outside the city of Madrid, and there is also a Fifth Column lurking in the city. Madrid will be opened from within by their hands, so the capital will undoubtedly fall into our army's hands!"</p>
<p>This can be said to be the origin of the term "Fifth Column." During this European war, Germany used the Fifth Column to disrupt the enemy's internal affairs and collect enemy intelligence, etc., and achieved great success. This invisible spy army not only makes the enemy helpless, but also seems to disturb the peace of mind of the world. However, what kind of organization is the so-called Fifth Column after all? In short, the Fifth Column is the most elite spy army trained by Germany for this European war. It is, of course, under the command of Himmler, the head of the secret police. The number of people, tens of thousands, is naturally unknown. They all have to obey iron-like rules and accept instructions from the headquarters, adapting to circumstances in order to achieve the greatest effect, so the matter of "life" must be put aside. Among them are men, women, old, and young. In short, each is assigned the most appropriate job according to the difference in their origin and education.</p>
<p>Let's take an example. When Germany invaded Poland last year, on September 8, the Polish stronghold of R府市 was bombed by a large number of German aircraft. One of the planes was shot down by Polish fire, and two pilots were captured by the Polish army. Under interrogation, both were very young officers. Two years ago, these two had stayed in R府市 as students, and the leader of the two belonged to was also living in R府市 for a long time, engaged in commerce.</p>
<p>For example, during the invasion of the Netherlands, this group of Fifth Column personnel preemptively destroyed canals and bridges to hinder the Dutch military operations. They set fires in the enemy's gasoline storage depots, airfields, and shipyards, spread rumors, and disturbed people's minds, etc. These were all their methods of warfare.</p>
<p>The Fifth Column is not only made up of Germans, but also many powerful pro-German foreigners. With their power, they form even stronger organizations, scattered like cells in the country, carrying out activities. The success of the annexation of Austria by Germany is the best example. Even in countries that have not participated in the war, the activities of the Fifth Column are also extremely fierce. The Iron Guard in Romania implicitly opposed the King, first assassinating Prime Minister 加利南士哥, and then plotting to oppose the King. Recently, the King of Romania finally softened and had to ask to compromise with the group.</p>
<p>In this war, the German army has tried its best to propagate to France that Germany only hates Britain and has no reason to fight France, but the activity of the Fifth Column in France is really very harmful. President 某决勒幼仑 inspected the Alsace war line in great secrecy, and the German troops in front immediately raised a flag saying "Welcome to His Excellency the President of France," and the German broadcaster played "La Marseillaise." More interesting than this incident was when British Prime Minister Churchill and Eden inspected the French army and had lunch in Lille. This was of course a very secret matter, but when the two were seated, the radio on the table rang.</p>
<p>"This is the Berlin radio station. Now France is holding a luncheon for Ministers Churchill and Eden in Lille. Let me tell you the menu..."</p>
<p>Then, in fluent English, he accurately reported the current menu of the two ministers, without a single error. In France, no matter how big or small, Germany seems to be able to see everything at a glance, so it is no wonder that the impregnable Maginot Line was broken through by Germany.</p>
<p>The Fifth Column is simply ubiquitous and uses every trick. Whatever people can think of, it has already done it. Now that France has surrendered, this new type of "spy army" will overcome all obstacles and attack England and the Balkan countries!</p>
<h3>Facts Speak Louder Than Words</h3>
<p>— Lin Zhonghao</p>
<p>The progress of science, the development of transportation routes, and the prosperity of commerce have already made the countries of the world have an inextricably complex relationship. Therefore, it is impossible for a country to adopt an isolated and detached attitude and want to break away from the world and not be affected by world affairs.</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese war broke out, in addition to expressing great admiration and admiration for China's determination and perseverance in resisting the war, many foreigners were skeptical about the sentence "China is fighting for the safety of the world." Some even thought that it was purely a propaganda slogan for China to ask for foreign aid.</p>
<p>However, after the outbreak of the European war, facts finally speak louder than words. The Anglo-French allied forces suffered repeated defeats, and France even humiliatingly sought peace, almost without time to take care of the Far East. If China had not continued to resist bravely here, how the power of Britain and France in the Far East would have been devastated and hit, no one dared to predict.</p>
<p>"China is fighting for the world!" This is not an exaggeration, but a true fact!</p>
<p>Facts speak louder than words!</p>

<h3>This is How a Person Should Be</h3>
<p>— Written by Mead, Translated by Ku Kou</p>
<p>Respect my country, my profession, and myself. Treat my friends with honesty and justice, just as I want them to treat me with honesty and justice. Be a loyal citizen, praise my country, and do nothing to damage its reputation. Be a person whose reputation follows his name.</p>
<p>Base the hope of reward on service. Exchange success for honest effort. Always take work as an opportunity, happily seize it, and make the most of it. Do not regard it as a painful, reluctant, and forced servitude.</p>
<p>Remember that success lies in myself, in my own brainpower, in my own ambition, in my own courage and determination. When encountering difficulties, fight against them. Take the experience of hardship and difficulty as information for future work.</p>
<p>Be devoted to my profession. Make everyone I see optimistic. Dispel anger with happiness, eliminate suspicion with certainty, and reduce friction with people with an easygoing personality.</p>
<p>Study my business carefully. Know the various aspects of my profession in detail. Use both brain and strength, work systematically, and have a method. Do what must be done when I have free time, and do not waste time. Save time as a miser saves money. Make every hour generate interest, whether it is the increase of knowledge or the cultivation of body and mind.</p>
<p>Make my future not be burdened by debt. Earn money and save money. Give up all expensive entertainment until I can afford it. Abandon promiscuity, maintain the health of my body and the peace of mind, just like maintaining valuable inventory in trade.</p>
<p>Finally, hold on to the joy of life. Be a decent man in a bright and upright manner. Overcome my own weaknesses and strive to become a strong and superior person.</p>
<p>Then I can be courteous to others, loyal to friends, and have a clear conscience before heaven.</p>

<h3>Kunming Film Industry Overview</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>(Kunming Airlines News) A year ago, in the summer, I arrived in Kunming, as if I had walked into a desert. When friends met, the methods to find entertainment in spirit were nothing more than playing chess, or trying their luck, acting on the spot, and playing mahjong to pass the time.</p>
<p>This is the same as the situation in the American West during its development. Now, this city is becoming more and more prosperous day by day! In the southern district of Kunming, among many beautiful buildings, a giant theater has emerged, which is the Nanping Grand Theater. It meets all reasonable requirements, has the beauty of both classic and modern times, is solemn and magnificent, and more valuable, the projection machine is a "Peacock Brand" automatic and complete instrument, for a blockbuster, it delicately and accurately shows it to the audience; until now, it has introduced a first-class blockbuster to the people of Kunming. This is:</p>
<p>Wings Over the World (Paramount). Stooges Go West (MGM). Bitter Sweet (United Artists). Virginia City (Warner Bros.). The Cowboy and the Lady (United Artists). The Oppenheim Family (Soviet Union). The Firefly (United Artists). If I Were King (Paramount). Little Lord Fauntleroy (United Artists). Camille (United Artists).</p>
<p>On the day of its birth on April 2nd of this year, facing the Nanping Grand Theater from afar, a music hall was being built, which was the prototype of the New Dayi Amusement Cinema. It was established with an investment of 300,000 yuan, because its shareholders are part of the shareholders of the Nanping Theater. In the Kunming film industry, they are sister theaters. In addition to the sisters, there are also a pair of old brothers, called the Dazhong Cinema and the Old Dayi Amusement Cinema. The perfection of the equipment and the strictness of the film selection are not worth mentioning. Their business policy is to entertain the audience with low-cost tickets. This may be unique here. During the screening, staff members tell the story of the play and the lines on the stage. Most of the Kunming audience believes that explaining the plot can increase the interest in watching the play.</p>
<p>The number of times that domestic films are shown here is very small. - Mysterious Flower, Isolated Island Paradise, and Northern Battlefield Loyal Record are like a flash in the pan. Recently, China Film Corporation shot the exterior scenes of "Thousands of Miles in the Air" in Kunming, and also brought many excellent actors, which made everyone pay attention to domestic films. I very much hope that the Shanghai film company will jointly set up a joint office in Kunming to introduce domestic films to the audience in the mainland as much as possible.</p>
<p>The development of Kunming's film industry proves that this city is progressing, at least it is no longer a desert! (Sent on June 15th)</p>
<h3>Spoken Drama Su Wu Shepherding</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>It is said that the United Arts Experimental Troupe and the professional troupe of Chu Xinxing are organized by ambitious young people, which is very admirable. This performance of Wang Jixu's creation "Su Wu Shepherding" is still the first public performance.</p>
<p>This play is mostly in line with historical facts, that is, Su Wu's son Tong Guo is also in the official history. Han Shu Volume 54 Su Jianzi Wu Biography Yun: "When Wu was old, his son died before he was seated. The emperor felt sorry for him; he asked the people around him whether Wu had a son in the Xiongnu? Wu Bai Bai Yin Ping Enhou himself said that when he sent the Xiongnu, a son Tong Guo was born to the Hu woman. There were voices asking to use the envoy to send gold and silk to redeem him. The emperor allowed it. Later, Tong Guo followed the envoy, and the emperor thought he was a Lang. It's just that I didn't mention whether the Hu woman would return home with him. Lake Baikal is Lake Baihaer. Historical Records Note Yun: "The North Sea is the northern border of the Xiongnu, and now it is Lake Baihaer."</p>
<p>Guo Moruo once wrote several poems in "Electric Light and Flint," one of which was Su Wu Shepherding. Now this spoken drama is also a beautiful long poem. Because of the design of Hu Xuguang, Ling Lei, etc., and the director of Wu Yonggang, etc., each scene has many beautiful pictures, and the position of the characters is also very beautiful. Although it is just a piece of white cloth covering the mountain, and two real sheep are tied to the fence, it is very much like a snowy and icy world; the costumes are also completely different from Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, purely Han Dynasty clothing, I think Ma Lianliang may also refer to it. As for the actors, Tie Nuo's Su Wu is the most successful. Xiao Qing's Tong Guo is also very cute, but the word "Jiang" in surrender should be read in the first tone, but it was mistakenly read in the fourth tone.</p>
<p>It is unexpected that such a calm subject matter can be performed actively and lively, from beginning to end, and the audience does not feel tired.</p>
<p>Tong Guo recognizes the words on the sand, and Su Wu gives his son the wind hat before returning home. These are all very poetic. The play writes about the loyalty and bravery of Su Wu and Chang Hui, which is contrasted with Wei Lu and Zhang Sheng, etc., which is the main theme of the play. The success of this point has been confirmed by the popularity of the box office in recent days.</p>

<h3>Inland Film and Drama</h3>
<p>— Chan</p>
<p>Shen Xiling left China Film Corporation last month and joined China Film Studio.</p>
<p>China Film Studio recently sent Zheng Junli to Xichang to shoot films about the customs of the Yi people.</p>
<p>Ms. Fengzi, the editor of the "Pingming" supplement of the Central Daily News, is shooting "The Frontier Storm" in Chongqing, which has now been completed. She plays the wife of Bai Kanshi.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian is rehearsing "Mulan Joins the Army," "Victory Year," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Peach Blossom Face," and "Rebellion" in Guilin, which are selling very well.</p>
<p>Tian Ao completed the entire script of "Yue Fei" last month, with a total length of 50,000 words, which was published in the Changsha National Daily.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "The Net of Heaven and Earth"</h3>
<p>— Shen Qi</p>
<p>The performance of "The Net of Heaven and Earth," although containing a kind of preaching meaning of "cause and effect" retribution, forcefully emphasizes a kind of psychological punishment and satirizes the irregular life of general collapsing strata.</p>
<p>Reviewing the play "The Net of Heaven and Earth," the progress of the story is very simple, explaining that after a person commits a crime, it is equivalent to owing a debt to society. Even if it is suspended or even avoided, it must be repaid in the end. The structure of the whole play is tense and exciting, with many climaxes surging in the five acts and eleven scenes. The murder of Mei Jieying by Ma Yuchuan in the second act, and the departure of Na Ru and the suicide of A Nan in the fourth act, etc., can all suppress the audience's emotions. The satire is also very strong.</p>
<p>As for the performance, Zhou Chu's Ma Jinchuan is the most important and the most successful in the whole play. The inner conflict of love and hate is fully displayed, especially in the movements, he can always enhance the terrifying scene, and the tone and tone are also enough to show a kind of, sick, and frivolous personality, which is also in line with his identity. A Nan is a sincere and simple person with the image of a good wife and mother in the play. Zhang Xuemei's performance is very vivid. Qiu Quan's Hai Meng and Lan Qing's Mrs. Grant are very competent, using fluent spoken language to set off their expressions. The rest, Mei Jieying of the Yellow River, and the doctor of Shao Hua, although they appear less, they have worked hard in drama and art.</p>
<p>Finally, after watching the whole play, I feel that we don't have to hate people, let alone hate criminals. What we hate is the social system. At the same time, we should work hard to reform the old system and create a new world!</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching "Yang Paifeng"</h3>
<p>— Lu Yuan Scholar</p>
<p>Shi Shan has performed the play "Yang Paifeng" (originally named "Fire Stick Performance") at the Renewal Stage for five or six times. Every performance is full, which shows his appeal. I was able to take the time to watch it the other night. The whole play is full and impeccable, and it is indeed a good structure. The reputation is by no means accidental. In short, Shi Shan's art can be summarized by the four words of vigorous and steady. As for the beauty of his posture and the lightness of his style, what is called flying like a startled goose and swimming like a dragon is especially superfluous.</p>
<p>According to this play, it should be simply called "Four Fights." There are many examples in dramas such as the Three Visits, Three Searches, and Three Slashes, and there is also a play called "Three Fights" in front (Yao Gang fights Wang Ying), so it is even more possible to name it "Four Fights." After watching, I wrote two poems:</p>
<p>After Qinglong fights, he fights Jiao Meng, internal strength succeeds in resisting foreign countries; the fire girl has many war achievements, and even sees Han Chang fighting in battle.</p>
<p>I only see the hand spinning like a wheel, the head-on blow is like waving a whip; the Hu children are strong and useless, kneeling before the heroine of Shenzhou.</p>
<h3>New Lineups of the Two Drama Circles (Below)</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Clown Ci Ruiquan, is a senior clown, and is also a typical figure in the Liyuan today. He has been paired with the Tan family for generations. His qualifications, experience, reputation, and status are similar to Xiao Changhua. Due to his age, he has not been here for a long time. (Old Ci is a basic figure in the Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying classes, but in the past Yanqiu came south, Old Ci did not follow him, and his son Shaoquan acted as a substitute, that is, when Fuying came to Shanghai last time, he also changed to invite Ru Fuhui because Old Ci was unwilling to suffer from the boat). This time, he resolutely went south, and we were able to see the typical figure of the senior, which can be said to be a great blessing. There is also Luo Wenkui, a famous clown in the north. Shanghai people are not very familiar with him, so it is necessary to introduce him: This person is the son of the old actor Luo Baisui. He has a family background and his art is quite extraordinary. Unfortunately, he was not met when he was young. In recent years, he has been teaching students in Ping, and he has never been in class. He has been quite frustrated. This time, he can be invited by Fuying, which can be said to be a Maxima meeting Bole. Wu Xing Zhang Lianting, is invited by Yang Shengchun's helper. According to Shengchun's helper, Han Shengxin was originally Shengchun's helper. This time Shengchun came south without inviting Shengxin, but invited Lianting, (according to Zhang Lianting is Gao Shenglin's helper) is also a strange thing. Hua Dan Ji Yanfen, originally named Xiao Guihua, is a disciple of Binqing Society, and is a teacher brother with Gu Yulan of the current Renewal Stage, (according to Gu Yulan's original name is Yulan Hua) was very popular in the early years, but now he is old and fading. The old Sheng Ha Baoshan, is a rising star. His art is no less than that of the predecessor Zhang Chunyan, and he is also a rich old partner. Song Jiting is also commendable. Looking at the supporting roles invited by Fuying this time, we can call them "a gathering of talents." What can be described even more is that many of the supporting roles here are relatives of the Tan family, such as Yang Shengchun is Fuying's sister Qian, Jiang Miaoxiang is Taiying's Taishan, Tan Shiying is Fuying's brother, and Song Jiting is Fuying's brother-in-law, etc. (Fuying's ex-wife is the Song family) This can also be said to be that internal promotion does not avoid relatives, and their performances are often more like a raging fire. One laugh.</p>
<p>Latest news: Regarding the Tan Troupe invited by the Renewal Stage, there are slight changes in the personnel. The painted face Ma Liankun did not reach an agreement due to official business issues and has stopped coming south. The old actor Ci Ruiquan decided to accompany Tan. In addition, there is one thing that the reporter did not expect, that is, Wu Sheng Yang Shengchun's target Han Shengxin decided to come with Shengchun, and Zhang Lianting was also on the list of invitees. It is also learned that Tan Fuying will come to Shanghai to perform the play "Silang Visits His Mother". The Tan Troupe has re-invited the old Dan He Shengqing (Fucheng Fourth Branch has two old Dan talents, one is Li Shengquan and the other is He Shengqing) to join, adding to the strength. The strength of this group of people in the Renewal Stage has become more and more strong.</p>
