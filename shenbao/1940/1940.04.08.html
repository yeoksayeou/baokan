<p>社評</p>
<h3>日海軍在南海的演習</h3>
<p>據日昨消息：日本爲報復美國在太平洋海操曁英法增加遠東駐艦起見，已決定集中軍艦飛機及輔助艦，將在台灣南海之間，舉行演習。此次美國之在東太平洋大規模從事操演，本含有警吿侵略行動的意味，日方的感覺不快，自屬當然，其海軍發言人甚至不惜報以惡聲。但日海軍突然決定，同時在南中國海面從事演習，其意義所在，却不僅對美國採取對等行動。這一點，凡與遠柬有密切關係的國家，都應該加以嚴密注視。</p>
<p>在日本傳統的南進路綫，雖經海陸軍方面及一部分財閥極力倡導，其海軍實力亦寖進而與英美爭衡，而數十年來的經營，除却攫取琉球台灣及委任統治各島而外，並無重大收穫足與北進的大陸政策爭一日之長，這一方面固由於在亞洲大陸的活動機會更多，更容易引起日閥貪慾；另一方面，也　始不因爲南太平洋上均勢局面已吿形成，不易冉遂行其較大的擴展。但自從中日戰事延及南海沿岸。日軍接連侵據廣州海南島西沙團沙各羣島，並竭力加以軍事經營之後，形勢已完全改觀。日軍的南侵據點，已自台廈一直延展到赤道迤北，有如在英美法荷各屬領的心臟上揷進一把七首。及至歐戰爆發，英法有事於歐陸，日方益視爲獲得可乘之機，不惜在諾蒙漢再度屈膝，以全力經營南進：半載以還，已有若干措置見之實施，此次日海軍之演習，並不舉行於波寗，玻璃亞那，加羅林等委任統治羣島之間，而獨看眼於南中國一帶，不消說實於日本南侵的軍事佈置上具有重大意義。</p>
<p>南洋原是全亞洲最豐腴的部分；米，茶，糖，棉，木材，樹膠等特產物都極豐富，尤其是軍事工業的原料，如錫，　，　，和石油，更爲侵略者所乖涎。際此美國考慮對日禁連警中，南洋各屬對日本自具有無上經濟價値，並被　爲最値得覬覦的對象。然而這只是說明了問題的一面。在經濟　係以外，南洋各屬正綰握着歐洲國家來往東方的海路孔道，同時又是在各該國全部領土中最易受攻擊的一環。加以距離各國母邦太遠，軍事的補充和接濟都極感困難，更有民族感情錯綜其間，容易搆成政治動亂，這些先天弱點都會被侵略者認成因利乘便的良好條件。所以如果一旦日方準備向各民治國採取攻勢以爲威脅，則南洋各屬領必首先被看成適宜的對象。目前日閥正困於侵華戰事的師老無功，最近施行的政治攻勢又未能收穫任何效果，則其利用尙未一試的海軍，乘歐戰方酣之際，轉而南向冒險倖進以求一逞，正小能說是絕對沒有其可能。</p>
<p>南洋各部之陷於此等危機，實不能不歸咎於已往西方一些政治家對遠東局勢之缺乏正確認識和戡亂決心；「九一八」以來的往事不必多講，即以香港安南而論，那都是英法在遠東生命綫的一端，但當日閥逐步環伺香港威脅越南的時候，英法却除了無當實際的空言抗議之外，絕無更有力的具體行動以爲答覆，則其招致日閥的輕侮，擴大侵略的貪慾，都是當然的後果。何况直到歐戰發生之後，在遠東擁有重大權益的各國間，始終未能形成抵禦侵略的共同戰綫，甚至有時還不免存有博取侵略者好感籍謀旦夕苟安的卑怯念頭，則南海風雲之日趨緊張自無足怪。如果不是中國的抗戰已把日本的資源人力消耗得衰疲不堪，說不定日閥的南侵企圖已早見諸更露骨的行動，自然現在還不是歷史淸算的時候，已往國際政治家在遠東政局中的是非功過原可不必深論，但歷史遺留下來的敎訓却不容不深切記取。有如美國此度在太平洋的海軍大操，無疑對於遠東局勢具有劃時代的意義，可是如果英法的遠東政策仍不能完全與美協調，並採取平行措施以助其貫澈，則美國警吿侵略者的效力勢將爲之削弱。日本海軍在南海的演習，確實是「以其大刀臨近各民治國的領土」，這確實是一種咄咄逼人的姿態。但是我們深信：在中國繼續抗戰的時期，日本絕對沒有向他國啟釁開刀的勇氣，也沒有向他國要索什麼的願望；日本但望祗此磨刀霍霍的表情，竟有卑怯的人們向他屈膝，應尤他助他一臂之力，完成其壓迫中國，獨呑中國的第一步願望；至於他的攫取南洋，在程序上，在軍略上，當然在取得中國爲據點之後，始事半功倍，始把握必勝！</p>

<h3>上海市塲之自我管理（上）</h3>
<p>—本刊第三次座談會紀錄提要—</p>
<p>日期　二十九年三月三十一日下午一時至五時</p>
<p>出席者　（簽名不分先後）</p>
<p>自我管理困難確多</p>
<p>主席　去年我們曾分析過物價上漲的原因是：外匯縮，商品供需失調，游資投機活動。一般的觀察也不外乎是。現在想請各位貢獻些善後辦法。現在的物價已漲到最高峯，如有合理的統制，效果必較初漲或正漲時大。不過此時此地，捨自我管理外恐無他法。兩租界當局雖正計劃着平衡物價的方策，可是他的成敗，也以市塲的能否相與合作爲斷的。再以目前的民生實情，以及本市的環境來說，又豈僅平衡物價一端已足？市塲以至於市民全體，誰都應該購求物質生活的自衛措置。惟市塲中人，在本位上更應先謀自衛之方。不過監於各業過去實施的自我管理，結果都很難使人滿意，問題在制度本身呢？還是在實施技術呢？是二個先決問題。</p>
<p>潘仰堯　兄弟曾和工商各界討論過這些問題，工商各界未曾不注意此，但有許多事實上的困難。比如限價制度可以促成（一）粗制濫造，使信譽好的受影響；要維持品質的水準，價就限不住。（二）刺激人心，造成普通的囤積和投機等現象。（三）影響來源，發生供給减少或生產减退等現象。至於自我管理制度的本身，又有兩大阻力，第一是各業公會組織不健全，不普遍；故公會本身的權能無法提高，管理的效力自然薄弱了。第二是外匯不穩定，物價就根本不能穩定，各種物價，有的連漲十五六次，有的連漲二十次之多。像熱水瓶變動十四次，化妝品變動十六次，三月五日的價格和三月一日的價格已不同。所以管理上極困難。變動愈大，囤風也愈高；廠商的困難也愈多。比如廠商於去年定出了貨物，到今年交貨，就發生虧蝕。除非廠商有充分的原料囤積着，但有　雄厚資力的廠商能有幾何？</p>
<p>王海波　率直些說：自我管理，制度本身就悲觀。去年座談會時，就有人批評這種辦法，是與虎謀皮。營業目的根本就相賺錢，是不是可以因實行自我管理，儘讓別人賺錢而我獨不幹？我個人可以如此，但公司當局不會尤許的。假使家家都都賺，我獨不賺，或所賺獨少，他日股東來責問時，做經理的豈能說爲了實行自我管理所致，如果這樣，股東會必要另請高明了！</p>
<p>潘恒動　最要緊的是　致自我管理。否則，自我管理就等於自我犧牲。</p>
<p>制裁與管理必須並進</p>
<p>主席　自我管理並非叫人不要賺錢，只是叫人賺合理的錢。而且唯有合理的錢。而且唯有合理的利潤，才是最穩靠最普遍而且更恃久。不過這種抽象的利益，敵不過眼前利益的誘惑。所以與論界應負糾正這種心理的責任。</p>
<p>王海波　現社會是自由制度；生意人熱中的是眼前的利益，合理不合理是不問的，在投機市塲上，誰都知道大賺的另一面是大蝕。但是他們還是只學大賺的人。所以要遏制投機，最好替游資找出路，指導各人投資的方法。如果只用道義等理論，是不能說服他們的。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　我覺得與論制裁的力量，是不小的。假使與論界能把囤戶等真姓名刊之報端，他們就不能不有所顧忌！</p>
<p>主席　如有負責的情報，確實的消息，報紙當然樂於盡量發表。但與論對於米市的抨擊，已不可謂不力，效果呢只好說聊勝於無。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　一般性的抨擊，當然不及指名揭發有力量。租界當局如再實行不予保護的政策，那末他們更不能不有所顧忌了。</p>
<p>潘仰堯　制裁是保證自我管理效果上所必要的。至於自我管理，究亦應先解決前述的許多困難。比如經濟部已有同業公會等新法令公佈，但上海過未能普遍遵行。健全公會組織是自我管理的前提。而在今日的上海，捨自我管理外又很少別的辦法。在座各位都是專家，希望多多貢獻。兄弟因中國國貨公司今午開股東會，要先走一步，請原諒（潘先生退席）。</p>
<p>物價趨勢之預測</p>
<p>主席　我總覺得現在的物價已漲到最高峯，自我管理不僅可保障消費者，其實工商界也可减少其風險。我的觀察有三種論據。（一）匯價下降以來，以去年九月份爲最緊。十月以來，鬆多縮少。新正以來，雖雙鄉規民約縮，但迄未打破當時的紀錄。可見牠在無形中已有其限度，除非法幣有變化。但這是絕對不會的，因爲國府決無自殺的理由。至於對方，果無時不謀破壞，但早已黔驢技窮！聯鈔　券等相繼失敗，可爲例證。新陰謀的結果也不外乎此。（二）日僞壟斷貨物來滬的手段，現已登峯造極。無論他還會花樣翻新，可是他要保留上海的市面，正和他想保留寗波溫州等口岸的出入自由理由完全一樣。否則他就要失其掠奪的的　　。所以日僞的掠奪雖無饜慾，但無形中也有被掠奪可能力的限制。（三）考古今中外，一般物價指數，就是在長期趨勢裏，也沒有超過四百分的先例。本市工人生活費指數，去年三月尚在一五五·二六分，本年二月竟已高達三七七·九二分，實屬罕見之事。比如倫敦經濟雜誌所編的英國批發物價指數，在歐戰的四年間也沒有漲成一倍。而且自編製以來，根本就沒有到達四百分的紀錄；而且經常都在一二百分之間。突破三百分是一九一九年十月的事；二〇年三月增至三七九·六分後即開始續降。至同年十月就跌進三百分以內，這雖不是物價法則，但超過一般購買力的物價決不能維持，却可爲佐證。所以我相信上海物價的崩跌就在眼前。自我管理，可以促成他的崩跌；其實也能緩和他的跌勢而使之冉冉下降，以免工商界的損失。</p>
<p>魏友裴　三月以來，一般物價的漲風，事實上已經停止。投機物品的價格，雖還在激漲；可是並未波及一般物價，這值得注意的。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　多多指出物價消長的趨勢和事實，也是與論界的責任，並且與指導游資出路是異曲同功的。</p>
<p>資金管理與指導出路</p>
<p>主席　今天的議題，本分兩部份。一是資金市塲的自我管理，一是商品市塲的自我管理。海波兄提出的指導游資，實爲前一部份的積極對策。比如出口事業，業爲極有前途的。吾人應多多提倡。並應具體的介紹。海波兄是此道內行請先公開你的業務心得。（眾笑）</p>
<p>王海波　不敢說心得，姑講講找所曉得的幾件事吧。有一位朋友，去年習了一些東西到美國去，非特出產了來回的一天大筆旅費，而且琮賺了二十多萬美元。滿載而歸，還有一位朋友。他爲了要推銷他廠裏的出品，所以帶了一些樣品，到南洋去跑了一趟。非特當即得了大批定單，而且僅僅把他隨身帶的那些樣品賣了，已經足够抵消他來回的那筆旅費。所以他回國以後，又添辦了一間小規模的出口行，專做對南洋的出口貿易。再者，我剛才來時，曾在外面看到中國農產製造公司的一塊照牌。這公司的創立經過我也曉得些，聽說是中華書局裏的幾位職員辦的。他們在大夏大學附近租了三百畝田，租金每畝僅六元，專種薄荷，據說每畝可得九十元收入，則每年可得二萬七千元收入，除去每年約七千元的開支，則就有二萬元的盈餘。</p>
<p>主席　說起薄荷，我也有一度接觸。有位朋友從蘇北帶來了十幾桶薄荷油，那時歐戰剛發生，薄荷油的牙市價正崩跌到每桶八元左右，他想以八元半出售，托我介紹某藥房的舍親，但不成功；又介紹給某銀行的一位朋友，請轉介紹給某薄荷廠，也不成功。幾個不成功，市價漲了。他後以每桶十元多出售；但至今又懊悔賣得太便宜。對於外行囤貨的投機者，這是一個有力的誘惑。但當時因歐戰而大家競囤引針，藥品，顏料，紙張的，結果就相反。脫手早的果然賺，慢的就蝕；愈慢蝕得愈大。與其說他們有幸有不幸，母寗說他是非正常的商業投機必有的結果。否則跌價時不必慌張，過漲時不會囤進。進出先要確實了解市塲大勢。如以爲物價高漲的現在，囤必嫌，那是大錯特錯！因囤貨投機的人，往往會弄到進得出不得，騎虎難下的局面。指導游資，當然不是指導他囤何貨，而是指導他應該經營那一種企業？而這種企業的選擇，至少不應妨礙民生的安全。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　那就是轉移投機的目標。徒他從日用品的投機，轉移到有利於國民經濟的某部份，而結果同樣可以獲得。</p>
<p>王海波　像這種工作。最好集合社會上有地位的人來領導，甚至還可以組織研究團體，負研究和提倡的職責。使人力和資力得到充分的合作。</p>
<p>主席　這是資金自我管理的一部份，我覺得還應加　拒做貨物押款等等工作。</p>
<p>潘恒勤　銀錢業當然是實施資金自我管理的中堅份了。但銀錢業所能做的只有拒做貨物押款的一項。　於已做的押款，則應限期催贖，使他不能繼續居奇。至於存款，則只有確保存戶利益爲重。</p>
<p>王海波　存款原非禍款，牠之所以參成肇禍的東西。因爲他不會合理運用？因此他們雖看到投機者的失敗悲劇而未免膽怯，但看到成功者的收穫時又蠢蠢欲動。所以最要緊的是指導他們以正確的出路。</p>
<p>主席　投資西南是指導資最好的一條出路。沒有毅力的，如碰到了事實上的若干困難，就趦趄不前，實屬一大憾事。今後尚應繼續推動。沒有毅力的要他直接投資旣有不易；就應該鼓勵他間接投資，如經營西南與上海的轉口貿易等等。經營此種貿易的商販，莫不盈利累萬。雖有榨取西南同胞商業利潤之嫌，在西南的物資供給上究不無幫助。同時尤應提倡西南產。資本證券化，使有志於投資西南的旬報於實行。</p>

<h3>去年蘇浙皖米產估計</h3>
<p>民二十六年蘇浙皖三省米產二億五千萬市擔弱。該年上海米價每石平均十一元四角半。去年產量不得而知；據重慶電傳，約在三百萬石至四百萬石之多，但如上計，去年比二十六年之增收在三千一百餘萬擔之上，可見供給力決無問題。</p>

<p>紛紛陳詞　發表政見</p>
<p>英僑候選人、即今工部局副總董凱自加、及美僑候選人海萊氏、亦於昨發表政見、說明其抱負、茲分誌如下、凱自威之談話大意、略謂、際此變幻多端、極度緊張之時期、余被推爲英僑候選人、固深知吾等對目前之社會、職責重大也、余認爲工部局最應注意者、厥爲公共租界區內之安全、蓋上海之所以成爲全世界之</p>
<p>一大都市</p>
<p>無非維持其安全、引起外人信仰、樂於投資、發展商業、在過去、租界區內安全、實足稱道、故余希望將來、亦能保持此種狀態、目前各方對工部局之支出浩繁、頗加訾義、然事實上若無鉅大之經費、而欲維持一大都市、實非易舉、余認爲工部局中一切如捕房·衛生處·救火會等機關、應</p>
<p>依照現狀</p>
<p>予以保留、余堅決反對有損於其組織之行動、工部局支出、雖應力加節約、但不能不加注意者、節的固極重要、但應以勿影響其工作爲度、藎居民之需要保障及安全、尤重於此也、此外、余雖認爲英僑對公共租界之建立、具有大功、足以自炫、川余則認爲公共租界屬於各國、非英國一國</p>
<p>所能統治</p>
<p>工部局之責任、端在滿足各國人士之需求、而對彼等之福利、予以尊敬、加以關切、余承認目前狀况、業已轉變、而上海亦須在新境况下、從事發展、如余當選、余當根據此種抱負、爲社會人士謀幸福云、美僑候選人海萊談話略稱、余認爲目前上海所發生困難情形、吾人不應畏縮不前、應始終抱</p>
<p>樂觀態度</p>
<p>並認爲在最近之將來、上海度過此難關後、仍當爲世界　易中心之一大商埠也、余深信吾人應盡力以維持此一大都市之行政安定、而認清上海市民國籍種族之復雜性、而設法滿足彼等之需要、余認爲工部局警務處及衛生處、在過去均有保障居民之能力、余</p>
<p>贊同禁賭</p>
<p>及懲治囤積居奇之奸商、行政費應絕對節約、當爲至理、但「便宜」與「經濟」、不當混爲一談、吾等應自行政之價値上、判斷一切耗費是否適當、故若因减少經費而致影響公共安全、則余不敢苟同、鄙意以爲在公共服務上、不應節的開支、然各級職員之薪金、則應加以縮减、工部局過去之行政新貢獻於吾人者、亦實應予以相當之稱頌、而其行政制度、將來亦仍應保留，吾等應以勇往直前之信心、繼績前進、</p>
<p>搞雄太郞　別有用意</p>
<p>日僑候選人塙雄太郞氏、昨日亦發表談話、略云、「公共租界旣爲各國人民集合之所、則其應爲「國際性」、自屬當然、目前存在之洋涇浜地皮章程、及工部局之組織、頗多缺點、其最軍要者、即缺乏「國際性」之趨向、雖各國人民、對租界當局所付之捐稅、有所差別、但彼等對公共租界繁榮之貢獻、在行政上應佔相當地位、則固屬一致、最合理想之境、乃在使每一國居民均有對租界行政貢其意見之機會、余願警吿各國人士、由於某國獨裁、罔顧租界居民整個之幸福、欲使租界發展繁茂、實不可得此「國際化」一名詞、決非無理由之要求、目前雖公共租界稱爲外人之租界、但在租界內仍由華人遣派代表、參加工部局與外人合作、在以往租界國籟之分別、尙屬簡單、但今日則世界各國、在滬地均有僑民、故租界國際化」以後、始可使各國人士與華人之間、有一「協調」之生活、然則目前租界行政權、似完全　諸少數國家僑民掌握之中、欲使租界「國際化」、目前之狀態、實應予改變、今日僑候選人即抱改進租界現狀、使之成爲完全「國際化」、</p>

<p>事前並未　通知海關</p>
<p>惟最近有非法之舉動、於本月（四月）一日起、對於出口之麵粉·茶葉·鐵·蔴·等類、均遭阻撓、過去數日中、已有多起發生、被扣處罰並勒令領取出口「許可證」、事前並未宜佈、亦未通知海關、一般報關行、對於此種無形損害、叫苦連天、但在淫威之下、無可奈何、聞前（六日）晨、有和合公與怡祥公兩報關行、時未便實行、代客報關、裝董惠記經理之丹輪曼西曼號、運往烟台麵粉二駁船、約計三千五百包、</p>
<p>日憲兵竟　擅自扣留</p>
<p>兩駁船甫出蘇州河、在外灘公園浦面、被駐水上飯店之日水上憲兵隊瞥見、遂將兩駁船扣留、該項麵粉、未能裝運出口、雖該兩報關行竭力設法疏通、結果未詳、照此情形、將來本市出口貿易受相當困難矣、</p>

<h3>蘇州河北警權問題　今日召集會議　討論若干重要管理辦法　滬西「新警隊」亦將會商</h3>
<p>關於虹口之警權協定、雖經工部局總董樊克令與日三浦總領事於最近簽字、但若干重要之管理蘇州河以北及指派警務官員問題、迄未解決、尙有待雙方之討論、據外人方面消息、現啊部局官方與日本當局、爲進一步使協定辦法、付諸實施起見、已定於今日下午開會討論、至於滬西越界築路之「新警隊」之籌備聞亦將於本週內召集會商、</p>
<p>遣散工作</p>
<p>上述兩大救濟機關、刻下正積極進行遣散工作、聞救濟協會方面、此項工作、將於六月底前逐步完成之、救濟協會善後處、已迭接難胞自動申請遣散之要求、據悉、難胞前往申請遣散者、多爲舉家流離之難胞、其原籍則多屬江浙兩省、其他則爲廣東香港重慶等處、遺散地點不論遠近、該會悉可資助遣散費每人國幣自二元起至二十五元、</p>
<p>自給難民　救濟分會所　屬之收容所</p>
<p>、分自給與非自給兩種、自給收容所之難胞、需出資購買廉價之白飯、刻下救濟分會、對自給之收容所難胞、將先令遣散、因若輩大部係已能自立之工人及小販、但據記者探悉、此輩均來自滬郊農村、有家歸不得、而避居所中、改營小販苦力爲生者、茍遣散出所、則其些微收入在此物價在漲之中、自難維持生計、又恐將流浪於街頭矣、</p>
<p>老弱殘廢</p>
<p>昨據救濟分會某委員表示、該會擬先將少壯者給資遣散、餘下之老弱殘廢難童、仍將予以收容、惟扶蓄難童、將爲該會最主要之工作、因兒童無力自給、需成人扶持也、聞將來遣「孤兒保育」之組織、以敎養難民所中之孤兒、</p>
<h3>各方均盼同鄉團體　運柩回籍</h3>
<p>滬市戰後人口激增、而死亡亦隨以比例增高、因交通不便、遺柩大多暫厝滬上、是以殯儀館曁寄柩所、呈一時繁榮、據估計滬西各寄柩所寄柩曁善莊浮厝、總數不下十萬餘具、滬市彈丸之地、擁此屍柩、當此天時轉暖、實公衆衛生之一大威脅、各方爲公衆福利計、均盼此項寄柩與浮厝、速籌善後及疏散之方、現有若干寄柩所、雖催吿屍屬將寄柩遷回、但大多因交通運費等關係、延未照辦、按滬上較有會館殯舍、以供同鄕寄柩之用、因所在地在華界、大多燬於砲火、或被佔用、同鄉寄柩、遂吿中輟、現各方頗盼此項同鄕團體、能出面舉辦集團運柩回籍、以協助同鄉辦理運柩事宜、事較易辦、所費當亦减省、至浮厝前有火葬之議、惟格於習慣、議論不一、亦需急予善後、</p>
<h3>公共汽車再加價　十五日起實行　汽油車胎零件無不昂貴　職工薪給激增亟應補救</h3>
<p>中國公共汽車公司、擬自四月十五日起又將增加車資、新價目將按每英里六分半之基礎計算、據云、此項新價目、向在每英里最高車資一角範圍以內、公司所持</p>
<p>增價理由</p>
<p>爲汽油·柴油·橡皮車胎·及各種裝配零件、不但因法幣匯價低落、負擔加重、即在原產地價格、以英鎊美金計算、因歐戰關係、亦均上漲、此外公司又因生活昂貴、增加職工薪資、</p>
<p>發給米貼</p>
<p>另有一點者應加考慮、、即按公共汽車公司慣例、對各項設備購置之準備金、均須按年提存、例如汽車防其年久不能應用、故每年須提出若干、以備將來購置新車之用、此項「物資淸償」費用、若按照物品之原來價値計算、在</p>
<p>目前市價</p>
<p>自不能獲得補充代替、故計算之比率、須予提高、或按現時比率、而將現用之物品價値、從新估計、因此種種、故不得不將車資增高、</p>

<h3>出差汽車司機人　要求讓步　以雲飛爲標準　按月四十五元</h3>
<p>本市祥生等四大出差汽車公司之司機人增加酒資　　、自月之四日變方談判仍　效果後、雙方即議定於昨日下午、分別開會、從長硏究、待各得結果雙方再作最後　判、勞方並於當時宣稱、　　計、難再　延、　資方於昨日以前予　具體答覆、據平　社記者昨向勞資兩方訪　昨日下午雙方雖分別開會討論、但資方仍未得具體結果、故亦未答覆勞方、須於今日下午答覆云、勞方開會結果、不堅持酒資問題、要求工資以雲飛公司爲標凖、按月四十五元、不得以工作日數計算、</p>
<h3>法租界平價方案　內容一斑　物價　用中法文</h3>
<p>法租界平準物價委員會、曾於本月四日舉行第三次全體大會、經議決三項方案、即（一）改善米煤市况辦法、（二）公布物價表創刊公報、（三）强迫各零售市店揭示物價等、業經呈請法總領事核准施行、茲經平明社記者探悉、關於此三項方案之內容、（一）强迫各零售市店揭示物價、即各店　須用法文或英文、及中文或俄文、標明其所售各貨每單位之價値、（二）公布物價表、即將本埠各日用品之物價、每週調查一次、而以公報之方式、發表其平均之價値、（三）改善米煤市狀况之辦法、因情形複雜，尙在硏究中、現尙未至發表之時期、總之、此次平準物價委員會之工作、備極勤奮、各小組委員、幾於每週均須出席會議一次、而對於物價之調查、亦深得各商界之協助、蓋以該委會之活動目的、固不惟純爲保護消費者之利益、即對於正當商家、亦自妥加維護、是以極得各方之贊助、</p>

<h3>宋杏珠白璧無瑕　貞操疑案昭雪　三次檢騐證明宋女貞潔　男女兩家重復言歸於好</h3>
<p>住居山西路北無錫路五十五號門牌之浙江虞縣人徐國鳴、（又名水根）於民國二十七年間、憑媒聘定同邑士紳宋鳳水之女宋杏珠（十七歲）爲室、當由徐給付聘金滋豐錢莊五百元存摺一扣、嗣徐擇於去年四月三十日假福州路同興樓菜館結婚、當即電知宋家、囑</p>
<p>准期来滬</p>
<p>完婚、乃屆期宋杏珠並不到滬、致結婚因此祇得延期、及至八月一日、宋杏珠始由艾氏伴來上海、徐國鳴之母即以預闢之新房、爲杏珠之住所、然自入宅之後、宋咨珠終日懨懨、飲食嘔吐、經延醫診治、兩月仍未稍痊、而腹部則有</p>
<p>隆起状態</p>
<p>徐乃疑宋女爲不貞、所患者定係十月之病、遂將女送回母家、一面將所交付之聘金滋豐莊存摺一扣牧回、（內已由宋支去一部份、僅存三百三十四元、）旋即要求解除婚約、而宋鳳水則以本人之女、絕對無不軌舉動、至遲延婚期之原因、則爲當接得徐國鳴之通知後、在動身來滬之際、適値</p>
<p>紹與封港</p>
<p>旋繞道溫州來申、又遇日機擲彈、不克成行、當時曾四次以電報通知不能來申原因、囑將婚期展延、故遲誤婚期之原因、乃屬遭遇不可抗力之事實、至所稱宋杏珠有懷孕狀態、乃屬杜造之流言、以爲解約之口實、總之、此次徐國鳴實已另有女友、該女且有</p>
<p>鉅額妝奩</p>
<p>爲徐所垂涎乃不惜故佈虛僞之傳言、以達其解的之目的、故對徐家之請求解的、予以拒絕、一面並延律師向特一法院對徐國鳴騙去存摺一點、依詐欺罪、提起控訴、結果宣吿無罪、而徐國鳴方面、亦延錢興中·趙芝枚·對宋杏珠提據</p>
<p>不貞懷孕</p>
<p>之事實、向特一法院提起解約之訴、而宋杏珠亦延張福康律師據實答辯、並提出反訴、要求返還該項存摺、同時爲證明宋杏珠之貞操起見、特向中國紅十字會第一醫院同德醫院陸勝千醫師等三次請求檢騐、結果、均證明宋女之處女膜並無、</p>
<p>破裂狀態</p>
<p>更無受胎或隨胎之現象、至此、宋女所受不名譽之事實、已吿大白、經此證明後、庭上即勸令雙方和解、徐國鳴亦願登報聲明、宋杏珠亦予諒解、遂由徐將所訴撤回、一幕因貞操之疑案、至此遂吿解決、而宋女之名譽、亦能予以回復矣、</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>小職員的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 三</p>
<p>我　是某大文化機關的小職員，在這百物　貴的現在，我的月薪也不過四十元左右。局方只供給一餐中膳，這樣，實際待遇還不到三十元。我已結了婚，因此，除我自己的生活外，我還須維持我妻子的一份生活。今將我們的衣食住行實况，膻述如下：</p>
<p>衣：現在的物價，至少要比戰前增加二三倍；所以在衣的方面，新的是添不起了，只好利用舊的或土布製的。例如我的大衣，西裝，都是數年前的舊衣，破爛呢，不妨織補織補：裏面襯衫的領子，袖子破了，也不妨改造一下。汗背心破了，不妨將破綻縫合，還不妨兩件併成一件。新的襯褲呢，可改用土布製；天氣冷，西裝褲內更不妨穿中裝褲。我的妻穿的也都是嫁時衣；有時添些衣服，也是買舊貨或利用已有的材料。</p>
<p>食：這一項佔據我們支出的大宗，但我們力求節省。每餐菜經常是一葷一素。米大多數託人從游擊區帶菜，價值較孤島便宜。肉類等葷菜也請人從鄉下帶出：素菜中除有些必需小菜塲購買之外，其餘黃豆，花生，蠶豆，鹹菜，蘿蔔乾，也向鄉親經來。煤球，現在雖賣到六元多一担，但我們幾家合生一隻風爐，輪流燒煮，還算經濟。</p>
<p>住：我們住的是六層樓的一個小房間，真好比鴿籠一般。房租因爲特殊關係，只有兩塊錢一月；不過隣居都係貧苦階級，環境不大衛生。但在我們自己這間裏，總弄得很整齊清潔。窗戶常開，使空氣流通，炭酸氣可以外洩，更不致中煤氣或生其他疾病。夏季因住處靠近外灘，夫婦各買公園派司一張，夜間常往納凉，故雖盛暑，亦無聽苦。</p>
<p>行：現在電車，公共汽車，都早已漲價，收入有限，車子也真有些乘不起。所以路近些的，只好安步當車；路遠些的，也盡力設法撙節車資。譬如到靜安寺，從拋球塲到那邊，三等要九分，但我走一段，從新世界乘到赫德路下車，再走一段到靜安寺，目的地同樣能達到，但只要五分錢就够了。再如到康悌路，那麼公共租界那一段不乘，走到大世界，來回也只要一角錢就够了。至於妻子上小菜塲，那差不多經常是安步當車。</p>
<p>這樣的苦吃苦熬，區區收入，倒也可以出入相抵。我們要熬，熬，熬下去，熬到天明！</p>
<h3>談鈕子</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>鈕子（俗稱鈕扣）是衣服上的重要附件，每件衣服若無鈕子便不能穿着，不過，用鈕子的多寡，男女不同，大槪男子的衣服，比較少用幾粒，而婦女的衣服上，鈕子特多，因爲女子的愛美心理，很爲濃厚，伊們除衣料的選擇，和裁製的新頴外，對於鈕子的式樣，也很考究，如盤香鈕，蝴蝶鈕等：在從前是很風行的，近來却和男服上的鈕子相仿，都用一根葱的直鈕子了。</p>
<p>上囬所述的鈕子，是指本衣料所製成的，而女子爲美觀起見，也可另選一種緞料來做鈕子，這類鈕子，是適用於長衫或旗袍上的。其他鈕子的種類也很多，如金屬，貝壳，電木，或動物的骨角等，都可做成鈕子，這類大槪都用於短衫，襯衣，背心等上面的，以示裝飾上的新奇，此外尚有　鈕一種，用　亦以婦孺的衣服上最多，男子的衣上是很少用的，更談到鈕子雖釘在衣上，而並不實用，如西裝袖口下的數粒（參看二月廿六日本刊「袖口鈕子的來歷」一文）和冬大衣袖口及後腰上的幾顆，這完全是服裝上的點綴吧。</p>
<p>鈕上雖是很微小之物，却有「禮」的意義存乎其間，依照「新生活運動」，凡着衣服，鈕子必须全体钮好，否则有失礼貌的，再据衛生家谈论，睡衣是不宜钉钮子的，应改繫软的带子，如是可便眠平稳安适，我们不妨提倡仿行哩。</p>
<h3>菉豆粞米可饱肚皮吗？</h3>
<p>— 陸利时</p>
<p>我　记得孤岛上一度闹着「住」的恐慌，但不久這問題却逐漸的消沉下去了，在目前，我想孤島上任何人都奪驚駭這「食」一項的嚴重罷？四五十塊錢一担白米，還要用種種方法纔能購得，麵粉十元多一袋已算是「平賣」了。想，如此高漲的生活程度，一般的民眾那能不感到不安呢？</p>
<p>我前次，曾在本刊寫過一篇米貴後的文章，勸大家「節食」，但這事在「節」的一方面太難收效了，並且應該整個都市中的人共同起來實行才對，所以本報社論論及敦勸民眾在消極方面用「節」的方法渡過這艱苦的難關，確爲針砭之言，可是「節」至無可再「節」的時候，米價仍然盤踞高巔，到那時也許只能多想些「代用品」式的食料過活了，有人說，米吃不起（指昂貴說）吃麥，我說麥吃不起吃菉豆粞米燒成的糊粥，亦是可以充飢的好東西，現在姑且把它來談談：</p>
<p>粞米就是米粒碎瑣不成米粒的東西，像北方張家口一帶，用高梁子代粞米和菉豆一起煮，我親嘗過挺香美的，南方沒有高梁子用粞米代價值差不多，困難的同胞，不妨把菉豆粞米試一下，看它可以飽肚皮嗎？</p>
<h3>第二歐戰之惜食運動</h3>
<p>— 昭實</p>
<p>中國俗話說，「惜食有食吃」，彼西方先進國之惜食運動，根據科學工夫，一唱百和，輒收事半功倍之效。查最近三十年間，惜食運動之推行，每隨世變興經濟潮爲起伏。凡戰爭與經濟恐慌之襲來，物力維艱，主持家政之儔，難爲無米成炊之巧婦。於是果皮肉骨，菜屑魚鰭，盡爲不容輕棄之有價物品，科學家比類分門，詳加推闡，列舉廢物有利於人之若乾重要餋料，揭載一般人因不甚注意而損失之億兆金錢，同時喚起一般人致力於科學之興趣。無中生有，積少成多，富家可分餘瀝，以救活災黎與難胞，貧家可盡固有之物力而避免損耗。本此精神，及時補救，在彼西方各國，因爲歐　期一種有備無患之要圖，在我東方多難之邦，自當爲刻苦忍耐諸同胞因禍得福之一種意外收穫。古人常云，「安得廣廈千萬間，大庇大千寡士盡歡顏。」予當改言之曰，「安得科學家千萬輩，指導惜食之方法，或設化學工廠，收集各戶廢棄之食物，提取養料，福惠人羣，俾我失業失所之國內同胞，盡展歡顏，產生百倍之精神，勵行百倍之勢力，輔助中央，共盡國民一分子應盡之天職也。」茲將西方科學家統計各項食物所生「熱量」與所損失之有益實料如下表。</p>
<p>上表二十四格之食品，專取治西餐之物料爲研究。食物供給人身「熱量」之多寡，對於日常工作所需體力之强弱有關，若貧民遇寒季，尤應廣畁供給熱量較多之食物，以便進食少而得力多。中國之大米飯與麵，供給熱量均甚大，非若西國麵包熱量之低，凡食麵包之北歐各地，非肉不飽，茹素乃爲食大米飯與麵者獨享之幸福，此見每日進食所得之「熱量」，通盤合計，決不宜低過最低格之一定限度以下也。至若煮薯用水勿過多，與乎一切菜湯肉湯暨罐食湯汁之不宜隨手傾素，則因其中含有目不可見之餋料。而如第三種維他命，（一作丙種餋生質）若加久煮，最易毀失。最新式罐封之蔬果，凡爲設備甚進步之製造廠，每知大批購進　維他命之新鮮貨，用戶如知先煮熱而後開食，又不傾棄餘汁，有時所得滋餋料，反比自家廚房內現下鍋之素菜爲更多。深望我國內主中饋之有心人，頻受專門學家之指導，特將中國菜所需作料，分照上表格式而製爲另表，則一唱百和之間，旣助他人謀利益，而自身復有利益，賴一舉手與一投足之勞，大可完成無上之德矣。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>每　年臘冬在過年的時期，人家往往要些大塊的肉來，用鹽與花椒來醃，可以藏幾個月不壞，到春天過清明時，纔拿出來吃，煮了之後，任是肥肉，也好像透明的一樣，入口並不覺膩，而花椒的香味，也是怪可愛的；這種肉稱爲臘肉。你家去臘可曾醃臘肉麼？那麼現在　這清明時節，正是吃臘肉的時候了。最好的辦法，是買些鮮肉來，和這臘肉一同白燉，加些竹筍和百葉結在內，味兒是挺好的。這一樣菜，呌做燉醃鮮，雖有些貴族化，但是辛苦工作了一星期，排在星期日享受一下也未爲不可。</p>

<h3>試爲蔡先生寫一筆簡照</h3>
<p>— 蔣夢麟</p>
<p>光緒己亥年的秋天，一個秋月當空的晚上，在紹興中西學堂的花廳裏，佳賓會集，杯盤交錯，似乎蘭亭脩禊和桃園結義在那盛會裏雜演着！</p>
<p>忽地裏有一位文質彬彬身材短小，儒雅風流，韶華三十餘的才子，在席間高舉了酒杯，大聲道：</p>
<p>康有爲，梁啟超，變法不澈底，哼！我！…」</p>
<p>大家哄堂大笑，掌聲如雨打芭蕉。</p>
<p>這位才子，是二十歲前後中了舉人，接聯成了進士，翰林院編修，近世的越中徐文長。酒量如海，才氣碎礴。論到讀書，一目十行。講起作文，斗酒曰篇。</p>
<p>位年齡較長的同學對我們這樣說。</p>
<p>這是我們學校裏的新監督，由陰才子蔡鶴卿先生。孑民是中年改稱的號。</p>
<p>先生作文，非常怪僻。鄉試裏的文章，有這樣觸目的一句；「夫飲食男女，人生之大欲存焉。」他就在這篇文章中了舉人。有一位浙中科舉出身的老前輩，曾經把這篇文章的一大段背給我聽過，可惜只記得這一句了。</p>
<p>記得我第一次受先生的課，是反切學。幫，膀，旁，茫。當，湯，堂，囊，之類。先生說，你們讀書先要識字。這是查字典應該知道的反切。</p>
<p>二三十年後先生在北京大學校長任內，學生因爲不肯交講義費，其勢洶洶。先生堅執校紀，不肯通融。秩序大亂。先生在紅樓門口揮拳作勢，怒目大聲道：「我給你們決鬥。」包圍先生的學生們紛紛後退。</p>
<p>先生日常性情溫和，如冬日之可愛。無疾言厲色。處事接物，恬澹從容。無論遇達官貴人或引車賣漿之流，態度如一。但一遇大事，則剛强之性立見，發言作文，不肯苟同。</p>
<p>故先生之中庸，是白刃可蹈之中庸，而非無舉刺之中庸</p>
<p>先生平時作文適如其　，平淡冲和。但一遇大事，則奇氣立見。</p>
<p>「殺君馬者道旁兒，民亦勞止，乞可小休。」這是先生五四運動時出京後所登之廣告</p>
<p>先生做人之道，出於孔孟之敎，一本忠恕兩字。知忠，不與世茍同。知恕，能容人而養成寬宏大度。</p>
<p>先生平時與梁任公先生甚少往還。任公逝世後，先生在政治會議席上，邀我共同提案，請政府明令褒揚。此案經胡展堂先生之反對而自動徹銷。我們中國人可以說沒一個人在不知不覺間受老子的影響的。先生亦不能例外。故先生處事，時持「水到渠成」的態度。不與人爭功，不與事爭時。別人性急了，先生常說「慢慢來」。</p>
<p>一位在科舉時代極負盛名的才子，中年而成爲儒家風度的學者。經德法兩國之留學而極力提倡美育與科學。在敎育部時主張以美育代宗敎。在北京大學時主張一切學問當以科學爲基礎。</p>
<p>在中國過渡時代，以一身而兼東西兩文化之長。立己立人，一本於此。到老具志小衰。至死其操不變。敬爲輓曰：</p>
<p>大德垂後世　中國一完人</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>瞿無雙取了一個小罐兒，到編輯室後方的一個小茶房裏，自去沏茶。這茶葉也是她的一位舊同學從杭州帶來的眞正明前茶葉。她們眞有點兒口渴，來得正好，說說笑笑，只聽得二層樓的餐廳裏，打電話給瞿無雙丁。說是：現已屆進餐的時候，瞿小姐倘然客人齊了，便可以下來進餐了。瞿無雙答應道；「好！我們就來了。」一班姊妹們，今天到這個報館裏，總算是粗枝大葉的看了一遍。若是要細細的攷察，那是一個大報館裏，每一部份有一部份的主管的人，由那主管的人導引與說明，要參觀三日三夜，也不大能够詳明咧。就是金澹雲從前陪着外賓，也來參覜過，可是倒還沒有今天那樣細到咧。因爲中國的報館，近來漸漸進步了，而歐美的報館，也愈加進步。講到物質文明的進步，東方容有不如西方之處。無論何種物質文明，總是先發明於西方，然後推行到東方來，新聞事業也何嘗小然。所以歐美人士來參觀中國報館，也無非似走馬看花一般，看一個大概罷了。不過有一件事，却使歐美人士所驚心的，便是中國復興以來，進步之速，大足驚人。便是金澹雲也說：（她去年陪了外賓，到此地來參觀，機器間也曾去看了一看，那印報機還沒有像此刻那樣多咧。」自然因爲報紙銷得多，印報的機器也要預備得多了。現在這家報館裏，每日可以連夜報共銷一百二十萬份，還有日增月盛之勢，當然每年要增添新機器了。她們當時便由電梯直到二層樓的餐室來，這個餐室，也很廣大。除了大廣間之外，也還有小室，今天瞿無變招待她們幾位姊妹，便定下一個小室來。雖說是小室，那是別於大歲間而言，也很爲寬敞的。大廣間中，有許多館內的職員編輯員，都是這裏就餐的。若是在白天職員就餐的最多，編輯目不過是辦晚報的幾位。晚上的一餐，編輯員就比職昌多，他們大概七點鐘進餐，吃完夜飯以後便進行到編輯工作時期了。瞿無雙今天請客，比較是一種很珍貴的大餐。她而且吩咐餐廳上的承値的人，席上安置了各種鮮花，她是爲歡迎新嫁娘金澹雲而設的，還要推金澹雲上座。（二六〇）</p>
<h3>兒童賭博</h3>
<p>— 公然</p>
<p>兒童的心靈是最純潔的，所以很客易沾染不良的習慣。他們對於賭博，格外感到興趣；在街頭巷尾的糖攤上，是他們學習睹博的處所。</p>
<p>最近，我在二條弄堂裏看見除糖攤上的賭博外，竟有一羣年齡較大的兒童，把書包作爲座墊，蓆地團坐着鬥「撲克」，他們把像銅板大的圓鉛皮當做籌碼，聚精會神的角鬬羞，輸贏　達五角以上。</p>
<p>我看了這些情景，不覺爲兒童的前途擔憂，他們染上了賭博的惡習，不但影響了學業，而且汚損了身心。我認爲：家長和敎帥們應當負起敎育他們的（偉大」責任。</p>
<p>然而，有許多家長和敎師，在暇時也在推牌九，又馬將</p>
<p>我在道里大聲疾呼，希望一般嗜賭的家長和敎師們，趕快勿賭；大家起來敎育這些習賭的兒童，這小但是爲了自己的兒女和學生的前途，也就是爲了國家和民族的前途！</p>
<h3>集腋成裘</h3>
<p>— 荊芥</p>
<p>現在兒童讀物旣然缺乏，兒童圖書館還在籌備，這不是應了那句「連水救不得近火」的俗語嗎？如果有人登高一呼，把人家已經讀過的舊書徵集起來，設立一個兒童借書處，公開出借。最好分區舉行，比較普遍一些，這樣，旣經濟，又便利，雖然是治標之法，例是輕而易舉的事情。</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Holds Tea Party, Receives Madame Sun Yat-sen and Madame H.H. Kung, and Foreign Guests; Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Also Attends and Delivers a Speech</h3>

When Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek entered the garden, the guests applauded warmly. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek then delivered a brief and sincere welcome speech, saying that the arrival of the two Madames Sun and Kung was not only warmly welcomed by all circles in Chongqing, but also pleased the people of the whole country. In her speech, Madame Chiang Kai-shek first used Mandarin, then switched to English, saying that the two Madames Sun and Kung were not only her sisters, but also her comrades. The two Madames have made great contributions to assisting in the war of resistance, and are especially our loyal comrades. Madame Kung's work in Hong Kong and Shanghai has been remarkably successful. I still remember that during the Battle of Shanghai, Madame Kung and several friends set up a hospital, saving and caring for a thousand wounded soldiers, most of whom recovered and returned to the front line to serve the country. When I was serving on the Aviation Commission, Madame Kung donated forty trucks, which greatly facilitated the transportation of our brave air force. When I went to Hong Kong this time, the two Madames Sun and Kung organized the Hong Kong Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association in Hong Kong, with Madame Kung as the president. Today, I am very happy to be reunited with the two Madames, and I believe that you are all as happy as I am. I have only one request to the two Madames, and that is that I hope the two Madames can stay in Chongqing, lead women's work, and jointly strive for the final victory. If the two Madames can accept this, it is my heartfelt prayer. After Madame Chiang Kai-shek finished her speech, the two Madames Sun and Kung spoke one after the other. The party ended at about 6 p.m., with everyone in high spirits. (7th Dispatch)</p>

According to the Yanling Township Head, the county people are honest and simple, and their faith in Emperor Yan is extremely enthusiastic. Every year on the second day of the lunar new year, tens of thousands of villagers go to Yanling (commonly known as the Master's Tomb) to pray for blessings. The incense is also endless throughout the year. Yanling is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with beautiful scenery and lush greenery, making it a scenic spot.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Exercises in the South China Sea</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, Japan, in retaliation for the United States' naval exercises in the Pacific and the increase in British and French naval vessels stationed in the Far East, has decided to concentrate warships, aircraft, and auxiliary ships to conduct exercises between Taiwan and the South China Sea. The United States' large-scale exercises in the Eastern Pacific were inherently meant as a warning against aggression. It is only natural that the Japanese side felt displeased, and its naval spokesperson even responded with harsh words. However, the Japanese Navy's sudden decision to conduct exercises in the South China Sea at the same time carries a significance that goes beyond simply taking reciprocal action against the United States. All countries with close ties to the Far East should pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>Despite the zealous advocacy of the Southern Advance Route by the Japanese military and some zaibatsu, and despite the Japanese Navy's growing strength to compete with Britain and the United States, decades of operations have yielded no significant gains to rival the Northern Advance's continental policy, except for the seizure of Okinawa, Taiwan, and the mandated islands. This is partly because there were more opportunities for activity on the Asian continent, which more easily aroused the greed of the Japanese clique; on the other hand, it is also because the balance of power in the South Pacific has been established, making it difficult to carry out larger expansions. However, since the Sino-Japanese War extended to the South China Sea coast, and the Japanese army successively occupied Guangzhou, Hainan Island, the Xisha and Tuansha Islands, and made every effort to carry out military operations, the situation has completely changed. The Japanese military's southern invasion strongholds have extended from Taiwan and Xiamen all the way to the north of the equator, like a dagger stuck in the heart of the British, American, French, and Dutch territories. With the outbreak of the European War, and Britain and France preoccupied in Europe, the Japanese side regarded this as an opportunity to take advantage of and spared no effort to pursue the Southern Advance: in the past half-year, some measures have been implemented. The Japanese Navy's exercises are not held between the mandated islands of Bonin, Palau, and the Caroline Islands, but are focused on the South China Sea area, which undoubtedly has significant implications for Japan's military deployment for its Southern Advance.</p>
<p>The South Seas are the most fertile part of all of Asia, with abundant specialties such as rice, tea, sugar, cotton, timber, and rubber. In particular, raw materials for military industry, such as tin, manganese, tungsten, and oil, are coveted by aggressors. At this time, with the United States considering an embargo against Japan, the various territories in the South Seas have unparalleled economic value to Japan and are regarded as the most desirable objects of covetousness. However, this only illustrates one side of the problem. In addition to economic ties, the various territories in the South Seas control the sea routes between European countries and the East, and are also the most vulnerable link in each country's entire territory. In addition, they are too far from their respective home countries, making military replenishment and supply extremely difficult. Furthermore, the complex ethnic sentiments there are prone to political turmoil, and these inherent weaknesses can be recognized by aggressors as good conditions to take advantage of. Therefore, if the Japanese side prepares to take offensive measures against various democratic countries as a threat, the various territories in the South Seas will inevitably be the first to be seen as suitable targets. Currently, the Japanese clique is trapped in the fruitless war of aggression against China. The political offensive recently launched has also failed to yield any results, so it is not entirely impossible that they might take advantage of the European War to use their navy, which has not yet been tested, to venture southward in the hope of achieving a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The fact that the various parts of the South Seas have fallen into such a crisis cannot but be attributed to the lack of a correct understanding and resolution of the Far Eastern situation by some Western politicians in the past. There is no need to dwell on the past events since the September 18th Incident. Taking Hong Kong and Annam as examples, those are the ends of Britain and France's lifelines in the Far East. However, when the Japanese clique gradually surrounded Hong Kong and threatened Vietnam, Britain and France, in addition to empty protests that were of no practical use, took no more forceful concrete actions in response. Therefore, it was only natural that they would provoke the contempt of the Japanese clique and expand its aggressive greed. Moreover, until the outbreak of the European War, the countries with significant interests in the Far East have consistently failed to form a common front to resist aggression. At times, they have even harbored the cowardly idea of winning the goodwill of the aggressors in the hope of temporary peace. It is therefore not surprising that the situation in the South China Sea is becoming increasingly tense. If it were not for China's war of resistance, which has exhausted Japan's resources and manpower, the Japanese clique's southern invasion attempt might have already manifested itself in more blatant actions. Naturally, now is not the time for historical reckoning. The rights and wrongs of international politicians in the Far Eastern political situation in the past need not be deeply discussed. However, the lessons left behind by history must be deeply remembered. The United States' large-scale naval exercises in the Pacific undoubtedly have epoch-making significance for the Far Eastern situation. However, if Britain and France's Far Eastern policies cannot be fully coordinated with the United States and take parallel measures to assist its implementation, then the effectiveness of the United States' warning to the aggressors will inevitably be weakened. The Japanese Navy's exercises in the South China Sea are indeed "bringing its big knife close to the territories of various democratic countries," which is indeed a menacing posture. However, we firmly believe that during China's continued war of resistance, Japan absolutely does not have the courage to start a war with other countries, nor does it have the desire to demand anything from other countries. Japan only hopes that this menacing expression will cause cowardly people to kneel before him, even helping him to complete the first step of oppressing China and swallowing China alone.

<p>Hong Kong: A Tokyo Japanese source reports that as the Heilongjiang River approaches its thaw period, Soviet military authorities are currently remodeling the existing small fortress defense line into a permanent defense line along the entire 5,000-mile "Man" (Manchurian) - Soviet border. According to Japanese military observers, this Soviet move aims to consolidate its Far Eastern national defense. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow: It is reported that the Far Eastern Red Army has begun constructing large-scale defensive works on the border of "Manchukuo", attempting to imitate the French Maginot Line and connect the original fortresses of the "Stalin Line" to form a 5,000-kilometer-long defense line. According to certain Japanese sources, the Soviet Union's intention is to strengthen its Far Eastern defenses in order to be able to fully cope with the Far Eastern situation.

<h3>Japan Eagerly Wants to Renew the Commercial Agreement with France; Negotiations Are Underway in Paris; The Disposal of Tianjin Silver is Also Involved</h3>
<p>Paris: The Franco-Japanese trade agreement expired on March 15th. Yesterday, negotiations began in Paris to sign a new temporary agreement. The commercial secretary of the Japanese Embassy spoke separately with experts from the French Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hoping to reach an agreement with the French side by the end of this month. Since the outbreak of the European War, the Japanese goods transported to France have been suspended, but Tokyo still hopes to transport silk and canned fish to France under the new agreement. Even before the war began, the total Franco-Japanese trade had already been reduced by half. In 1937, the total number of Japanese goods transported to France was 48,500,000 yuan, but in 1939, it was reduced to 21,500,000 yuan. French Morocco, Indochina, French West Africa, and Syria are all the only markets for Japanese goods (cotton fabrics, silk, and rice). The annual number of Japanese goods transported to French territories is more than that transported to mainland France. On the other hand, the total amount of goods transported from French territories to Japan in 1939 was 48,500,000 yuan. Proceeding simultaneously with the above negotiations is the Japanese attempt to have the French side agree to the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the Tianjin silver issue. According to the agreement that will be established in the near future, the Tianjin silver will be transferred to a mixed committee, which includes representatives from Japan, the United States, Britain, and France. The silver currently stored in the French Concession in Tianjin totals 26 million yuan. (7th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>National Political Council: Subgroup Review of Proposals, Government Officials Attended for Explanation, General Assembly Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing: On the morning of the 7th, the various subgroup review committees of the National Political Council held meetings separately to continue reviewing various proposals. Relevant government officials also attended to provide explanations. The general assembly was suspended for one day on the 7th. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, delivered a speech at the National Political Council today. He stated that the draft constitution passed by the National Political Council three years ago could be implemented, but it could not be said to be without flaws. No constitution in the world is unchangeable and completely flawless. Generally speaking, the constitutions of many countries are of an overly progressive nature. Political changes are extremely rapid. Today's ideal constitution may not be suitable for tomorrow's situation. China's constitution cannot be an exception. Furthermore, the New China Daily published a commentary on the National Political Council's discussion of the constitution, also believing that the constitution draft from three years ago is not in line with the current situation. The newspaper stated, "The constitution we need today is based on concrete reality, in other words, based on the principles of national liberation and resistance against Japanese aggression, and must take the Three Principles of the People as the fundamental principle. The old constitution draft is extremely unsuitable for today because the people's freedom is absolutely inviolable, and the point in the old constitution that the premier is appointed by the president and not elected by the National Assembly is also inconsistent with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's plan." Furthermore, a female member of the National Political Council declared at the meeting that women's liberation can only be achieved with a constitutional government. (7th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation: March 30th to April 5th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated that the war situation this week (March 30th to April 5th) was more intense than last week. The Sui, Gui, and Hua armies continued to expand their victories. Victories were also repeatedly achieved on the battlefields of Jin, E, Xiang, and Lu. Japanese casualties were extremely heavy. The more important aspects of the combat operations are described below:</p>
<p>Sui West</p>
<p>After the recovery of Wuyuan and Hua Ke, the Japanese army in Anbei and other places, regarding Wuliang as the gateway to the Northwest, which is militarily vital, spared no expense to counterattack. They engaged in fierce river battles with Hua on the banks of the Wujia River, once reaching the outskirts of the city, and a portion even rushed into the city. Hua Zhong, Jian, and others demonstrated great courage and fought more bravely. In fierce battles until the 30th, the Japanese army completely collapsed and fled eastward in multiple directions. By dawn on the 1st, after the Hua army cleared the remaining Japanese troops in the city and suburbs, they continued to pursue, successively capturing strongholds such as Wuzhen and Wubulang Pass, and completely eliminating the Japanese who had retreated to the north side of Xishanzui, directly pressing on the outskirts of Anbei, completing the encirclement and currently annihilating the remaining Japanese. Since the Japanese launched a large-scale invasion westward from Baotou in late January, all the cities and towns they had occupied have now been completely recovered by Hua. The main force of the Japanese army that had been gathered has also been completely annihilated by Hua. The Sui West Hua army has thus created an unprecedented victory in history.</p>
<p>Gui South</p>
<p>The Japanese, retreating east of Lingshan, collapsed westward through Jiuzhou, Luwu, Bailao, and other areas. The Hua army fiercely pursued, sweeping away like fallen leaves, and began to annihilate them section by section west of Shangsandi. By the morning of the 4th, the Hua army had pressed on to the outskirts of Yongqin. Another large army separately besieged important strongholds such as Xiaodong north of Qinxian, Liangqing south of Nanning, Tingzi, and Datang in the middle section of the Qin Road. In order to relieve the siege, the Japanese dispatched troops from Yong to attack Funan from all sides, and dispatched troops from Qin via Dasi and Guitai to attack Longmen and Feiliang. The Hua army was prepared and severely attacked the Japanese in separate directions, defeating the Japanese who invaded Funan in one fell swoop, recovering the county seat, and pursuing them to Wucun. The Japanese retreated towards Nanning. The battle at Longmen and Naji is currently in a stalemate. The Japanese plan to counter-encircle has been completely shattered by Hua.</p>
<p>Jin Southeast</p>
<p>Over a thousand Japanese troops who entered Fengyizhen (west of Tunliu) on the 2nd continued to invade northwest. Hua severely attacked them near Zhangdian, killing over five hundred Japanese. The remaining Japanese have been surrounded and will be annihilated without difficulty. The An'yi, Yuncheng, Xiaxian, and Wenxi areas in Jin South are still under siege by Hua. The Japanese army near Xiaxian has been completely wiped out by Hua. After continuously beheading over a thousand Japanese and inflicting heavy casualties, they are actively reinforcing. The battle situation is gradually unfolding.</p>
<p>Yu East</p>
<p>The Hua army has been fiercely attacking the Japanese entrenched in various strongholds in the past week, breaking into Huaiyang in one direction, fighting fiercely in the streets for a day and night, killing countless enemies. In another direction, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese southeast of Suixian, killing over five hundred Japanese. In yet another direction, they pressed on to the outskirts of Tongxu, where the Japanese were annihilated in large numbers. Currently, all forces are advancing bravely, sweeping away everything in their path. Kaifeng is in a state of extreme shock.</p>
<p>E East</p>
<p>The Japanese, having gathered several thousand troops last week, launched an invasion of the mines at the junction of Huang, Xiao, and Li, but were defeated. This week, they again attacked Baoanzhai, Luojiashan, and other places (northeast of Huanggang) with over two thousand troops in multiple directions. Hua bravely resisted and, with a strong force, flanked the Japanese from the rear, engaging in a fierce battle for two days and nights, annihilating over half of the Japanese. The Japanese attempt to disturb the Dabie Mountains has thus failed again. In addition, there have been repeated fierce battles in Gaomi, Anqiu, Huaiyuan, and other places in Shandong Province, killing over fourteen hundred Japanese. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 3rd, the brave Hua air force bombed Yuncheng and Yueyang, destroying over thirty Japanese aircraft and over sixty-eight thousand units of gasoline and ammunition. This should also be specially reported. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Prominent Figures in Rong Jointly Send Six Letters Abroad to British, American, and French Authorities, Expressing Gratitude</h3>

<h3>Britain and France Launch Diplomatic and Economic Offensive in Northern Europe and the Balkans, Demanding Sweden and Norway Restrict Trade with Germany, Germany Believes This Move Threatens the Neutrality of Northern European Countries</h3>
<p>London: The ongoing Entente diplomatic and economic offensive is divided into three parts: (1) A note to Norway and Sweden, informing them that the Entente intends to tighten the blockade; (2) French Minister of Blockade Monnet and British Minister of War Economy Cross hold talks aimed at tightening the blockade; (3) British Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to begin talks tomorrow with British envoys stationed in the Balkans. According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the British note to Norway and Sweden does not contain any threatening language, but rather conveys a statement and reserves Britain's right to respond to German attempts to use Norwegian territorial waters as cover to violate the blockade. Monnet and Cross have agreed to block the loopholes in the control of contraband. Foreign Secretary Halifax and the British envoys stationed in the Balkans, in a meeting at the Foreign Office, joined by the British Commercial Corporation, a new government trade organization participating behind the scenes, will discuss how to use trade in the Balkans to best benefit the Entente and divert every ton of essential raw materials that might aid Germany to the Entente. It is also heard that the meeting will further address the situation in which Germany might re-employ former Reichsbank President Schacht to defeat the Entente's plans, but the Entente does not feel alarmed by this, as they possess surplus money, machinery, and determination to make their policies effective. No financial magician can resist this pressure with his blockaded currency and his only weapon of barter. The involvement of the British Ministries of Supply and War Economy in this diplomatic conference is no less than that of the British Foreign Office. The British envoys stationed in the Balkans will also find that they are now participating in a cause that far exceeds the scope of diplomacy. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: A reporter from the Haitong News Agency here met with a diplomat from Norway yesterday and learned that Sweden and Norway will exchange views before responding to the notes from Britain and France, and then send the same reply to the governments of Britain and France. It is rumored in Oslo that eight-tenths of the note submitted by Britain and France discusses political issues. Therefore, Britain and France have not sent notes to the countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden on all basic issues. Diplomatic negotiations will begin in London. It is also said that Norwegian Foreign Minister Gutte stated that he had protested to Britain ten times and to Germany five times. The facts will prove during the negotiations in London that Norway has no malice, and the Norwegian representatives can speak with confidence. (7th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: Well-informed sources here confirm that French Prime Minister Reynaud delivered official documents to the Swedish and Norwegian envoys stationed in France last night, discussing general issues related to the relationship between the Entente and the Scandinavian countries. The purpose of this document is to explain the Entente's attitude towards various issues related to the neutrality of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A Reuters reporter learned that although the Entente's note to Sweden did not explicitly request a reply, Sweden will reply. It is likely that Sweden and Norway will first exchange views, or Sweden will reply first, and then Norway will send a reply. According to responsible sources, the British note did not require Sweden and Norway to take immediate action, nor did it foreshadow British and French measures, but merely stated the Entente's views. However, if Sweden and Norway seek Germany's protection due to concerns about a Soviet attack, the Entente will regard it as an action unfavorable to the Entente. The British note barely mentioned the issue of ore. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: The British and French governments have sent the same notes to Norway and Sweden, stating that they will immediately tighten the blockade policy. A correspondent from the "Fremdblatt" stationed in Berlin recently telegraphed that "this note has aroused the most intense reaction in Germany. German officials believe that Britain and France intend to carry out inspections in the North Sea, and even in the territorial waters of Norway and Sweden. Well-informed sources in Berlin also believe that the British government has requested Norway and Sweden to restrict the amount of their trade with Germany. Therefore, although the current situation is not critical, it is very serious." (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Criticizes British and French Attitude</p>
<p>Berlin: A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry made a statement to foreign journalists this afternoon, stating that the activities of the Allied countries at the end of this week are aimed at threatening the neutrality of the Scandinavian countries. The notes from Britain and France were sent to the foreign representatives of Norway and Sweden yesterday. Senior officials here believe that this move by Britain and France is intended to draw Sweden and Norway into the vortex of war against Germany. The spokesperson continued, stating that Swedish and Norwegian newspapers avoided calling the British and French notes "notes," presumably at the direction of officials, in order to calm the people's emotions. However, German people believe that this move by the Allied countries is a further interference in the Northern European countries. The spokesperson continued, stating that the recent speech by the French Minister of Blockade defended this measure in every way. We have no opinion to express on this. This is a matter for the neutral countries to express their opinions on. The spokesperson continued, answering questions, stating that people in Berlin knew nothing about Britain concentrating troops and transport fleets to prepare for intervention in the Scandinavian countries, only that Britain is currently mobilizing 100,000 troops to carry out activities in Northern Europe. (6th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Historical Turning Point in British and French War Policy</p>
<p>London: The British and French governments sent the same notes to Sweden and Norway yesterday. According to various observers, this is a historical turning point in the war policies of Britain and France. These countries not only formally notified the two Northern European countries of their attitude, but also informed them that they are willing to provide assistance when necessary. In the case of Norway alone, Foreign Minister Gutte met with the British envoy and conducted talks, and the British envoy supplemented and explained certain sections of the note. Although Norway and Sweden may submit replies, this is not necessary, because the various measures decided by the British and French governments, which are used to stop Germany from violating the rights of the neutral countries, are bound to be implemented, regardless of whether Norway and Sweden accept them. Therefore, the economic war between Britain and France against Germany is bound to intensify at any time. In general, all current blockade measures will be extended from the sea to other areas, especially the sky (Germany has recently attempted to use aircraft to trade with neutral countries). Political figures say that the German propaganda machine often points out that Britain and France have differing opinions on many issues. The fact that the two governments sent the same notes to Norway and Sweden is a concrete denial of this propaganda. Britain and France have the same determination to prevent Germany from abusing the territorial waters of neutral countries. Both sides want to conduct a comprehensive economic war and believe that this is the most effective response to Germany. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>German Government Has Lodged Representations with Norway</p>
<p>Copenhagen: The "Berliner Tageblatt" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Berlin stating that the German government has lodged representations with the Norwegian government through diplomatic channels, stating that if the country allows "Britain to undermine its neutrality and thereby gain military advantages in the war against Germany, it will be enough to cause various impacts, and attention should be paid to this." (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>In Terms of Economic Warfare, Britain and France Cooperate Fully, Senior British and French Officials Meet Twice, Deciding to Intensify Blockade Policy</h3>
<p>London: News was received here last night that Britain and France, after a conference, have completed a plan to intensify the blockade against Germany. This plan includes the Pacific Ocean. At the same time, Britain and France will promote trade with countries neighboring Germany to prevent the import of mineral oil and fat oil into Germany. Britain has notified Norway and Sweden that, after the Soviet Union's victory in Finland, the Allied countries have greatly increased their concern for Scandinavia. If Scandinavia throws itself into Germany's arms, or the Soviet Union makes any demands on Scandinavia's Atlantic ports, the Allied countries have resolved to take a firm stance on this. This proposal by the Allied countries to intensify the blockade was decided after a meeting between British Minister of War Economy Cross and French Minister of Blockade Monnet. During the meeting, a detailed plan was drawn up regarding the shortcomings of the Allied blockade. The issue of Scandinavian iron ore and the transport of oil from the Soviet Union via Germany were the main topics of discussion during the meeting. On Friday evening, Monnet gave a speech at the Ministry of Economic Warfare, stating, "We are currently taking new steps to make Germany increasingly discouraged." (7th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: After French Minister of Blockade Monnet came here and held talks with British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross, they jointly issued a communique stating, "The two sides held two successive talks yesterday and today, discussing various important issues related to their respective departments. They agreed on the same views and have proven that the two countries will cooperate fully in all aspects of economic warfare in the future." (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Foreign Minister Claims to Strive to Avoid War and Defend Territorial Sovereignty</h3>
<p>London: Norwegian Foreign Minister Gutte stated yesterday that Norwegian military authorities have been asked to consider the issue of a Northern European military alliance. It would be best for Norway to postpone any decision until relations between the Soviet Union and Finland are clearer. Gutte did not mention the note that British Foreign Secretary Halifax personally delivered to the Norwegian envoy stationed in Britain. Gutte mentioned naval warfare, stating that Norway had lost 54 ships, totaling over 120,000 tons, with a crew of 392 people, half of whom were lost due to mines. At least 12 were sunk by German submarines or other warships, or bombers. Gutte also mentioned the bombing of the Norwegian merchant ship Mira, stating that even if this ship was sailing under British protection, we cannot accept Germany's reason for bombing it. Gutte later mentioned the Finnish war, stating that if Norway allowed the Allies to transport troops via the country, or if Norway provided Finland with armed military assistance, then Germany would definitely regard it as an act of hostility towards Germany. Furthermore, Finland has never requested military assistance from Norway. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Oslo: Norwegian Foreign Minister Gutte elaborated on Norway's foreign policy in the parliament yesterday, stating that except when forced to fight to protect its independence and freedom, we cannot imagine Norway participating in any war. We can only use a policy of strict neutrality towards all parties to stay out of war. We have followed this in our commercial policy. All trade issues are resolved through commercial adjustments based on the principle of maintaining Norway's normal trade with belligerent countries within the possible scope. We must defend territorial waters to reject illegal intrusions. After the recent speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Churchill, he dares to believe that Britain will not want to violate international law and Norwegian neutrality. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy Deeply Dissatisfied with Britain and France</h3>
<p>Rome: Well-informed sources here recently stated that although the Fascist Party newspapers are now doing their utmost to promote and point out that the British and French decision to intensify the blockade against Germany is enough to cause major disputes, and even say that Italy has the possibility of going to war with Britain and France, and should prepare accordingly, the Italian people do not believe in this statement, and generally say that it will not be expanded to this extent. However, the main goal of Britain and France is to isolate Germany, and Germany is bound to retaliate. Therefore, if the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula follow the lead of Britain and France, Germany may take military action against these countries. In addition, Italian political figures are extremely displeased by the presence of British warships in the eastern Mediterranean, especially the Adriatic Sea, and say that Italy hopes to increase the quantity of goods transported to Germany, so it is difficult to accept the British and French proposal to intensify the blockade, and it is even possible to consider sending warships to escort German ships carrying Italian goods back to the country.

<h3>US Army Aircraft Blind Flight Successful, Takeoff and Landing Entirely by Instruments</h3>

<h3>US Memorial Day, Tri-Service Parade, Secretary of the Army Delivers Speech on US Military Expansion Goals, Aiming to Safeguard the Security of the New World</h3>
<p>New York: Today is the 23rd anniversary of the United States joining the last European War, also known as "US Army Day." Approximately 30,000 officers and soldiers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as members of various patriotic organizations, paraded here in formation. At the same time, many aircraft soared into the sky, and a large number of new-style military equipment participated in the parade.

Spectators gathered along both sides of the thoroughfare, a sea of people, all beaming with joy at witnessing the strength of the US military. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Yesterday was "US Army Day," which is also the 23rd anniversary of the United States joining the last European War. Secretary of the Army Woodring delivered a speech that evening, saying, "Today, twenty-three years ago, the United States officially joined the World War. It is true that our army and the armies of the Entente powers achieved the final victory, but I believe that we should not celebrate on this day of participation in the war, but only commemorate it, because there are those who have lost limbs and those who have been separated from their families forever. The blows to the American nation, materially, economically, and even spiritually, can be described as profound and painful. How can we bear to celebrate it? As for the US national defense, we have actively expanded our military equipment in the past year. We must increase sufficient strength so that we can avoid falling into the whirlpool of war under the protection of this strength. Therefore, all our military preparations are based on maintaining peace and are by no means motivated by participating in war. In short, no other country in the world today can speak of peace with greater authority than the United States. Therefore, we have decided to work for peace in the Western Hemisphere." (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: US Assistant Secretary of War Johnson stated that if we encounter war again, our country's most effective defensive weapon would be the ability of American industry to supply military supplies and equipment.

<h3>Northeast Coast of Scotland: German Aircraft Attack Lighthouse - First Time Since Outbreak of War; French Air Force Shot Down Two German Planes on the Western Front</h3>

<h3>European War Enters Second Phase; Front Lines Long Quiet; German Army Awaits Opportunity</h3>
<p>Berlin - The "People's Observer" reporter, Seibolt Bauer, writes that the second phase of the European War is about to begin. Winter has passed, and the state of quiet on the front lines will also change. Newspapers in various countries are making various speculations about the war situation, while the newspapers of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union remain silent, closely watching the development of the international situation. The omnipotent state is still in a position to launch war. The omnipotent state does not need to make predictions about the war, because the course of the war will be determined by the omnipotent state. Recently, people from all sides have expressed surprise that Germany has not accepted provocations and launched a blitzkrieg attack. However, we do not want to forget the main disputes and be controlled by the enemy. We remember everything and will take action at the appropriate time. Our minds are calm and clear, our bodies are strong, and we have an iron will and determination. Eighty million Germans support the Führer, Hitler. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>German Press Flirts with Japan</h3>
<p>The Hague - German newspapers today published articles continuing to please Japan in an attempt to get that country to help Germany in the current European war. For example, the "Rheinisch-Westfälische Zeitung" stated, "Germany's victory in Europe will also benefit Japan." The "Kölner Zeitung" also carried an article intending to have Japan cooperate closely with Germany, which stated, "The U.S. Navy plans to hold exercises in the Pacific, which is a provocative action against Japan. Japan should pay attention to this. President Roosevelt's aggressive policy and the United States' firm opposition to the 'New Order in East Asia' can be seen here." Political figures here have commented on this, saying that the German newspapers were quite cold to the establishment of the "Wang Jingwei New Regime" a few days ago, and even held a hostile attitude. It was not long ago that they suddenly changed their tone and flirted with Japan, which is also suspicious. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Former British Secretary of War Discusses the Norwegian Territorial Waters Issue; If Norway Cannot Guarantee Strict Neutrality, Its Territorial Waters Should Be Considered a War Zone</h3>
<p>Havas Society London News - Former British Secretary of War Bilitsha wrote an article "Britain, Norway, and the Question of Neutrality," stating that since the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" was defeated with skillful navigation by the British destroyer "Cossack" entering Jøssingfjord in Norway, the confidence of Britain and France has been even more invigorated, and the enemy is increasingly frustrated. At that time, people were vying to spread the joyous news of the detailed reports of the battle. The will of the British nation has become more firm, and the dull war situation has also become more lively. This pre-emptive strike and calm response of the British side are comparable to the victory of the British Atlantic Fleet over the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" at the mouth of the River Plate in Uruguay. However, whether the British warships entered the territorial waters of a neutral country to seek legal protection of British citizens and release captured personnel is a display of the traditional wisdom of the British Navy or a prelude to the active operations of the British side is not yet clear, but the focus of the war has temporarily shifted from the Western Front to the North. The troops guarding the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line are now standing guard against the other's attack. The original situation of stalemate between the two countries is what strategists fear. Surprise attacks and flanking maneuvers are what military strategists prefer. In order to resolve the European war, the German army took advantage of the means of lightning speed, passing through Belgium to exert this strategy. But on the Western Front, whether Germany will take this strategy again remains to be proved by facts. As for other aspects, whether Britain and France have the possibility of a flanking attack on Germany and the Soviet Union, please examine the geographical position of Britain and explain it. Britain's position is closely connected to the most prosperous area of the European continent. Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France are all countries that can be countered by British power. All Atlantic trade in this region can be controlled by the bases of the British mainland. Most of Europe's industries, activities, enterprises, and the distribution of the European population are also most prosperous in this region. In peacetime, Britain controls its gateways to maintain maritime freedom, and in wartime, it naturally uses a blockade policy to prevent the enemy's supplies. As in the last European war, Britain also used this as the most effective measure to subdue Germany. Germany spent a lot of effort trying to break through this blockade. Its fleet was unable to do anything, and it had to resort to attacks to destroy Central America's overseas trade and its escort warships. This policy is called counter-blockade, and the weapons used are submarines, mines, and aircraft. If Germany were to obtain multiple ports in this area and form a chain to avoid and add fuel to, the effectiveness of the counter-blockade would be greater. If we examine the map, we can know that Norway is located on the side of Britain. If the people of that country are in the hands of a certain naval power to be hostile to Central America, it can seriously restrain the British fleet and make greater and stronger surveillance of the British air force. This is why the German side is eyeing the Norwegian coast. However, Germany's consistent policy is to avoid the dangers of military aggression and to seize practical benefits by means of intimidation without war. The German pocket battleship Deutschland sailed into the North Sea and sank the British auxiliary cruiser "Rawalpindi," which was done by passing through Norwegian territorial waters. The "Admiral Graf Spee" attacked British merchant ships in the high seas, although it eventually destroyed itself, but it also sailed out through Norwegian territorial waters. The German giant mail ship "Bremen" was discovered by British aircraft and submarines when it returned to its country, but it also escaped by using the cover of Norwegian territorial waters. In addition, since the beginning of the war, Germany has been importing major industrial raw materials from Sweden, such as iron ore sand, through Norwegian territorial waters. In short, German ships freely sailing in Norwegian territorial waters and sinking British ships by torpedoes or mines are common occurrences. The "Altmark" incident is the most recent one. Norway's fear of Germany is the same as that of other neutral countries, which is understandable and sympathetic to us, but Norway only allows one country to use its territorial waters, which is not the case for other countries. This conflicts with its neutral status, and the impact of such partiality not only hinders the military operations of Britain and France, but also hinders the commerce of various countries, sacrifices the lives of people of various countries, and even extends the war due to Germany's abuse of Norwegian territorial waters to obtain supplies. This situation is no different from Germany passing through Belgium and attacking Britain and France, so that Britain and France do not have the opportunity to retaliate. Accordingly, if Norway cannot guarantee strict neutrality, then Britain and France should recognize the country's territorial waters as part of a war zone, and the country should not have any objections. In this way, the effectiveness of British fleet patrols can be greater, the number of German warships invading merchant ships in the Atlantic can be reduced, and German ships scattered in various places cannot return to the country. The number of British, French, and neutral ships sunk can be reduced, and Germany's feeling of supply difficulties will inevitably increase. Moreover, since the Soviet army invaded Finland, the Scandinavian Peninsula has no longer been a paradise for excellent nations. If the Soviet army crosses Finland and arrives at Narvik, Norway, the situation in which the Soviet Union and Germany compete for each other's growth and decline in the Baltic Sea will change into a crucial issue. The crisis of these countries joining forces with Britain and France in a frontal conflict will inevitably become more dangerous. In summary, it can be seen that the Norwegian issue is really related to British interests, and the British should deal with it properly.</p>

<h3>Important Polish Archives - Tenth German White Paper</h3>
<p>Berlin - The tenth German White Paper on Polish Archives publishes a document, which is a report submitted by Polish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Raczynski, to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London on March 9, 1939. The original text is as follows: Today I hosted a banquet for the British Secretary of State for Foreign Trade, Hudson, and invited officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to accompany him to discuss Hudson's visit to Warsaw at the end of this month. This banquet has eliminated the misunderstanding about the import restrictions of British goods to Poland. I will submit another report on March 10 to discuss this issue. This development has constituted a good basis for exchanging opinions. Hudson's attitude is straightforward and openly discusses various political issues, which is very different from the cautious attitude of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The adoption of this method is probably intentional, because the British government hopes to exaggerate its power, determination, and optimism towards Italy to Poland. I think that Hudson's remarks should be interpreted carefully. These words are not concrete guarantees or promises, but general remarks without restraint, and contain a propaganda flavor. However, Hudson's straightforward attitude made the conversation quite interesting. Hudson frankly admitted that the basic principle of the British attitude is to resolutely deal with the threat of Germany. Hudson believes that the danger of Italy is very small. He firmly believes that Italy's economic power is not enough to threaten Britain alone. Hudson is also quite optimistic about the German issue. He claimed that Germany's economic situation is more difficult due to the reduction of exports. The German Minister of Economy and others have requested the establishment of economic understanding. Hudson believes that the British government will never give up any European market to Germany, but Britain does not want to compete for the position of other countries in the Central European market. Hudson declared that Britain is currently conducting economic negotiations to overturn Germany's exchange of goods system. Britain will invite General Goering to London in the autumn, and various issues of colonial raw materials can be resolved within 18 months. Peace and political stability can be restored. However, Hudson still mentioned the "resistance policy." He believes that Britain has abandoned the slogan of the past 20 years and is linked to the war era of the late 19th century. Hudson raised the following four points regarding the Soviet issue: (1) How is the strength of the Soviet Union? (2) What is the significance of the recent signing of a commercial agreement with the Soviet Union? (3) Will British-Soviet relations become closer? (4) Is the Soviet Union interested in a friendly relationship with Britain? I replied in a diplomatic tone and especially emphasized the fourth point. The current Soviet representative believes that the threat of war is in the area where the West "resists the least." The Soviet Union is strong and must be anxious about future developments. Hudson also said that he had heard the same remarks from Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky yesterday. Three conclusions can be drawn from Hudson's change of tone: (1) He is extremely attentive to visiting the Soviet Union. (2) He attaches great importance to this visit. (3) The Soviet Union has expressed indifference. Hudson probably wants to increase British-Soviet exports from a British perspective and obtain a new balance in addition to political significance in the Moscow negotiations and economic affairs. March 10 - After the report was completed last night, I met with Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky at a reception and confirmed that my judgment on Maisky's conversation with Hudson was correct. According to my impression, close British-Soviet political relations have not yet been established. Russian officials are still reserved about Hudson's desire to visit Moscow. Hudson stated that he also has no fixed plans to visit Warsaw. His purpose is only to increase the exchange of trade and increase British exports to Poland with "export loans." Signed by Polish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Raczynski. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>British Steel Production Doubled Compared to Before</h3>
<p>London - Minister of Munitions Burcham recently delivered a speech in Wolverhampton, saying that since the outbreak of the war, British steel production has doubled compared to before, and no less than one million pounds are spent daily on building new factories. The situation is very different in Germany. The number of raw materials produced by the country is limited, and due to the blockade measures implemented by Britain and France, it is impossible to import them in large quantities, which is far less convenient than Britain and France's procurement. In addition, the governments of Britain and France are studying a plan to exchange machine tools. French Minister of Munitions Taoutri previously asked me whether the machine tools owned by the two countries could be regarded as equivalent to "tourists" and allowed to pass through the English Channel between Britain and France at any time. For example, France currently has six flour milling machines that need to be used after three months. It may be transported to Britain first, and after borrowing it for three months, it may be transported back to France. For example, Britain currently has six drilling machines that are temporarily idle, and it is also advisable to transport them to France for use. This plan is extremely appropriate in principle, because all the machine tools owned by the two countries can always be used to their fullest extent. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Zhen Dan Cup Small Football League Accepts 38 Teams in A and B Divisions, with 78 Teams Registered, 40 Teams Eliminated Due to Field Constraints</h3>
<p>The registration for the second Zhen Dan Cup Small Football League closed the day before yesterday. At the end of the football season, athletes are suffering from a lack of opportunities to practice their skills. Therefore, as many as 78 teams participated, more than three times the original limit of 24 teams in the A and B divisions. This huge number has caused the organizers to think hard, and there is a difficulty in whether or not to accept them. The two major problems of venue and time make it difficult to accommodate this huge number of teams. Currently, 14 teams have been selected for Group A, divided into two groups, A and B, with seven teams in each group. A single round-robin system is used to produce the champion, and then the two champion teams compete for the Zhen Dan Cup, the overall championship. 24 teams are called to Group B, also divided into two groups, with twelve teams in each group. The method of producing the Shunjie Cup, the overall championship, is the same as that of Group A. Group A has exceeded the original limit by two teams, and Group B has doubled, but as many as 40 teams are still left out. According to Mr. Liang Qishan, the secretary of the association, he told reporters yesterday that the association was very sorry that it could not follow the enthusiasm of the teams due to the two major problems of venue and time. The authorities of each team should also be able to understand deeply. However, in order to reward the enthusiasm of each team, a Group C competition will be held after the end of the league to accommodate this huge number of pearls. The date will be around September and October, and it will be held within the possible scope to provide a place for those who love small football.</p>

<p>Many Difficulties in Self-Management</p>
<p>Chairman: Last year, we analyzed the reasons for the price increase as: foreign exchange contraction, imbalance between supply and demand of commodities, and speculative activities of floating capital. The general observations are also the same. Now I would like to ask everyone to contribute some solutions. The current price has risen to the highest peak. If there is reasonable control, the effect will be greater than when it first rose or is rising. However, at this time and in this place, there may be no other way than self-management. Although the authorities of the two concessions are planning a policy to balance prices, its success or failure depends on whether the market can cooperate with each other. Furthermore, in terms of the current livelihood of the people and the environment of this city, is it enough to only balance prices? Everyone in the market and even all citizens should purchase self-defense measures for their material lives. However, those in the market should first seek self-defense in their positions. However, in view of the self-management implemented by various industries in the past, the results are difficult to satisfy people. Is the problem in the system itself? Or is it in the implementation technology? These are two pre-requisite questions.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao: Brothers have discussed these issues with the industrial and commercial circles. The industrial and commercial circles have paid attention to this, but there are many practical difficulties. For example, the price limit system can promote (1) shoddy workmanship, which will affect the reputation of good ones; to maintain the level of quality, the price cannot be limited. (2) Stimulate people's hearts and create common hoarding and speculation. (3) Affect the source and cause a reduction in supply or production. As for the self-management system itself, there are two major obstacles. The first is that the organization of various industry associations is unsound and not universal; therefore, the power of the association itself cannot be improved, and the effectiveness of management is naturally weak. The second is that the foreign exchange is unstable, and the price cannot be stabilized at all. The prices of various commodities have risen 15 or 16 times, and some have risen more than 20 times. For example, the price of a thermos bottle has changed 14 times, and the price of cosmetics has changed 16 times. The price on March 5 is different from the price on March 1. Therefore, management is extremely difficult. The greater the change, the higher the hoarding wind; the more difficulties for manufacturers. For example, if a manufacturer ordered goods last year and delivers them this year, he will suffer a loss. Unless the manufacturer has sufficient raw materials in stock, but how many manufacturers have such strong financial resources?</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: To be frank, self-management is pessimistic in itself. At the symposium last year, some people criticized this method as seeking skin from a tiger. The fundamental purpose of business is to make money. Can I let others make money and I alone don’t do it because I implement self-management? I can do this personally, but the company authorities will not allow it. If everyone makes money, but I alone don’t make money, or make less money, how can the manager say that it is caused by the implementation of self-management when the shareholders come to question him one day? If so, the shareholders will have to hire someone else!</p>
<p>Pan Hengdong: The most important thing is to achieve self-management. Otherwise, self-management is equivalent to self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sanctions and Management Must Go Hand in Hand</p>
<p>Chairman: Self-management does not mean not making money, but making reasonable money. And only reasonable money. And only reasonable profits are the most reliable, the most universal, and the most sustainable. However, this abstract benefit cannot withstand the temptation of immediate benefits. Therefore, the public opinion should bear the responsibility of correcting this mentality.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: The current society is a free system; what businessmen are enthusiastic about is the immediate benefit, and they don’t ask whether it is reasonable or unreasonable. In the speculative market, everyone knows that the other side of making big money is losing big money. But they still only learn from those who make big money. Therefore, to curb speculation, it is best to find a way out for floating capital and guide everyone's investment methods. If only theories such as morality are used, they cannot be convinced.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: I think the power of public opinion sanctions is not small. If the public opinion can publish the real names of the hoarders in the newspapers, they will have to be concerned!</p>
<p>Chairman: If there is responsible information and accurate news, the newspaper is of course happy to publish as much as possible. However, the criticism of the rice market by the public opinion is not considered weak. What is the effect? It can only be said that it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: General criticism is certainly not as powerful as pointing out and exposing names. If the concession authorities implement a policy of no protection, then they will have to be more concerned.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao: Sanctions are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of self-management. As for self-management, many of the aforementioned difficulties should be resolved first. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has already promulgated new laws and regulations such as trade associations, but Shanghai has not been able to universally comply. Sound trade association organization is a prerequisite for self-management. And in today's Shanghai, there are few other ways besides self-management. Everyone present is an expert, and I hope to contribute more. Brother has to leave first because the China National Products Company is holding a shareholders meeting this afternoon, please forgive me (Mr. Pan leaves).</p>
<p>Prediction of Price Trends</p>
<p>Chairman: I always feel that the current price has risen to the highest peak. Self-management can not only protect consumers, but also reduce the risks for the industrial and commercial circles. I have three arguments based on my observations. (1) Since the depreciation of the exchange rate, last September was the tightest. Since October, there have been more relaxations than contractions. Since the New Year, although the double township regulations and folk customs have contracted, they have not broken the record at that time. It can be seen that it has its limit invisibly, unless the legal tender changes. But this is absolutely impossible, because the National Government has no reason to commit suicide. As for the other party, they are always plotting destruction, but they have already exhausted their tricks! The successive failures of the Joint Savings Certificates and other coupons can be taken as examples. The result of the new conspiracy is nothing more than this. (2) The means by which the Japanese puppets monopolize goods coming to Shanghai have now reached the peak. No matter how they innovate, they want to retain the Shanghai market, just as they want to retain the freedom of entry and exit for ports such as Ningbo and Wenzhou. Otherwise, they will lose their plundering target. Therefore, although the Japanese puppets' plunder is insatiable, there is also an invisible limit to the ability to be plundered. (3) Ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, the general price index, even in the long-term trend, has never exceeded 400. The cost of living index for workers in this city was still at 155.26 in March last year, but it has soared to 377.92 in February this year, which is rare. For example, the British wholesale price index compiled by the London Economic Magazine did not increase by one time in the four years of the European War. And since its compilation, it has never reached 400; and it is often between 100 and 200. Breaking through 300 was in October 1919; it increased to 379.6 in March 1920 and then began to decline continuously. It fell below 300 in October of the same year. Although this is not a law of price, it can be used as evidence that a price that exceeds the general purchasing power cannot be maintained. Therefore, I believe that the collapse of Shanghai prices is imminent. Self-management can promote its collapse; in fact, it can also alleviate its decline and make it fall slowly, so as to avoid losses in the industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<p>Wei Youpei: Since March, the general price increase has actually stopped. Although the price of speculative goods is still rising sharply; it has not affected the general price, which is worth noting.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: Pointing out the trends and facts of price increase and decrease is also the responsibility of the public opinion, and it is the same as guiding the way out for floating capital.</p>
<p>Capital Management and Guidance of the Way Out</p>
<p>Chairman: Today's agenda is divided into two parts. One is the self-management of the capital market, and the other is the self-management of the commodity market. Brother Haibo's proposal to guide the floating capital is actually a positive countermeasure for the former part. For example, the export business is very promising. We should promote it more. And we should introduce it concretely. Brother Haibo is an expert in this field, please first disclose your business experience. (Everyone laughs)</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: I don't dare to say experience, let me talk about a few things I know. A friend of mine learned some things last year and went to the United States. He not only produced a large round-trip travel expense, but also earned more than 200,000 US dollars. He returned full of loads, and there was another friend. In order to promote the products of his factory, he took some samples and ran to Nanyang. Not only did he immediately get a large number of orders, but he also sold the samples he brought with him, which was enough to offset his round-trip travel expenses. Therefore, after returning to China, he added a small-scale export company, specializing in export trade to Nanyang. Furthermore, when I came just now, I saw a signboard of the China Agricultural Products Manufacturing Company outside. I also know something about the establishment process of this company. It is said that it was run by several employees of the Zhonghua Book Company. They rented 300 acres of land near Daxia University, and the rent was only 6 yuan per acre. They specialized in planting mint. It is said that each acre can get 90 yuan of income, which means an annual income of 27,000 yuan. After deducting the annual expenditure of about 7,000 yuan, there is a surplus of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Chairman: Speaking of mint, I also had contact with it once. A friend brought more than a dozen barrels of mint oil from northern Jiangsu. At that time, the European War had just broken out, and the market price of mint oil was collapsing to about 8 yuan per barrel. He wanted to sell it for 8.5 yuan, and asked me to introduce him to a relative of a certain pharmacy, but it was not successful; I also introduced him to a friend of a certain bank, asking him to transfer the introduction to a certain mint factory, but it was not successful either. After a few failures, the market price rose. He later sold it for more than 10 yuan per barrel; but he still regrets selling it too cheaply. This is a powerful temptation for speculators who hoard goods without knowing the market. But at that time, because of the European War, everyone competed to hoard lead needles, medicines, pigments, and paper, and the result was the opposite. Those who sold early did make money, and those who were slow lost; the slower they were, the more they lost. Rather than saying that they are lucky or unlucky, it is the inevitable result of abnormal commercial speculation. Otherwise, don't panic when prices fall, and don't hoard when prices rise too much. To get in and out, you must first understand the overall situation of the market. If you think that hoarding will be hated now that prices are rising, that is a big mistake! Because people who hoard goods for speculation often end up in a situation where they cannot get in or out, and it is difficult to get off the tiger. Guiding floating capital is certainly not guiding him to hoard what goods, but guiding him to which kind of enterprise he should operate? And the choice of this kind of enterprise should at least not hinder the safety of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: That is to shift the goal of speculation. It leads him from the speculation of daily necessities to a certain part that is beneficial to the national economy, and the result can be obtained in the same way.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: For this kind of work, it is best to gather people with status in the society to lead, and even organize research groups to be responsible for research and promotion. So that human and financial resources can be fully cooperated.</p>
<p>Chairman: This is a part of the self-management of capital. I think we should also add the work of refusing to do cargo mortgages, etc.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: The silver industry is certainly the mainstay of implementing capital self-management. But the silver industry can only do one thing, which is to refuse to do cargo mortgages. As for the mortgages that have already been done, they should be urged to redeem them within a time limit, so that they cannot continue to hoard and seek high prices. As for deposits, the only thing that is important is to ensure the interests of depositors.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: Deposits are not inherently evil money. The reason why they participate in causing harm is because they are not used reasonably? Therefore, although they see the tragic failure of speculators and cannot help but be timid, they are eager to move when they see the gains of successful people. Therefore, the most important thing is to guide them to the correct way out.</p>
<p>Chairman: Investing in the southwest is the best way to guide capital. Those who lack perseverance will hesitate when they encounter some practical difficulties, which is a great pity. We should continue to promote it in the future. It is not easy to ask those who lack perseverance to invest directly; we should encourage them to invest indirectly, such as operating the entrepot trade between the southwest and Shanghai. Merchants who operate this kind of trade are making profits of tens of thousands. Although there is a suspicion of squeezing the commercial profits of the compatriots in the southwest, it does help in the supply of materials in the southwest. At the same time, we should also promote the capital securitization of southwest products, so that the Xunbao who are interested in investing in the southwest can implement it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rice Import and Export Statistics</h3>
<p>According to the customs records: The import and export volume and value of rice in Shanghai in recent years are as follows:</p>
<p>Republic of China Quantity (metric tons) Value (national currency yuan)</p>
<p>25 245,042 2,619,777</p>
<p>26 204,913 2,166,775</p>
<p>27 1,751 28,989</p>
<p>28 43,339 607,892</p>
<p>Import Quantity (metric tons) Value (customs gold)</p>
<p>25 91,994 343,385</p>
<p>26 307,876 1,811,145</p>
<p>27 644,934 3,743,129</p>
<p>28 457,652 1,921,412</p>
<p>As for the re-export number, the customs has not yet announced the figures for last year. The figures for 27 years are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Re-import 148,978 1,568,770</p>
<p>Re-export 460,971 5,310,364</p>
<p>The above is limited to the number of customs declaration imports and exports; as for the number of undeclared customs, how much is it? Except for those who are in the know, no one knows the details.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Rice Production Estimate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui</h3>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the rice production in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui was slightly weaker than 250 million market burdens. In that year, the average rice price in Shanghai was 11 yuan and 45 cents per stone. Last year's output is unknown; according to Chongqing telegrams, it is about 3 million to 4 million stones. But as calculated above, last year's increase in income compared to the 26th year was more than 31 million burdens, indicating that there is absolutely no problem with the supply capacity.</p>
<p>(Note) (1) Estimated by the former Ministry of Industry of the National Government, (2) Survey unit of the "China Research Institute" of the Japanese, in thousands of market burdens.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Candidates' Platforms: Taxpayers Should Support Them; Cadett and Others Announce Personal Aspirations; Satisfying All Parties' Needs and Sharing Welfare; Advocate for Gambling Prohibition and Punishing Hoarding and Speculation</h3>
<p>Regarding the election of members to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the British and American sides, seeing the Japanese side's deliberate schemes and attempts to undermine the status quo of the International Settlement and further seize its governance, have abandoned their usual calm attitude and engaged in active efforts to complete their united front. They are striving to expand their influence abroad, aiming to absorb the scattered votes of German and Russian expatriates to support the seven candidates from the British and American sides. Although the Japanese side is using its political and military power, as well as its relations with Germany and Italy, to attempt to force British and American influence out of the Settlement, on the one hand, the British and Americans do indeed possess substantial interests in the International Settlement. On the other hand, among the German and Italian expatriates, there are not a few enlightened individuals who deeply understand that once the International Settlement is destroyed by the Japanese side, the freedom of trade and residence for the people of those countries may not necessarily be beneficial. Therefore, there are quite a few who have dispelled their preconceived notions of supporting Japanese candidates. Now, with only one day left until the first day of the election, the tense situation is imaginable to us all. The public, and the future destiny of the Settlement, for good or ill, will originate in these two days.</p>
<p>Japanese Activities Also Becoming More Active</p>
<p>Since the British and American expatriates expressed their determination to deal with this election with all their strength, the Japanese side's actions have also become more active. The following is an excerpt from the general content of the speech given by the Japanese Expatriate Election Committee to its residents and taxpayers the night before last at 8 p.m., to give a glimpse of it. The gist of the speech stated, "Currently, the British side and the Shanghai Municipal Council are jointly suppressing Japanese voters, especially conducting investigations into taxpayers who pay indirect taxes, preparing to deprive them of their voting rights. This is greatly regrettable, but we are determined not to lightly retreat and will continue to bravely advance to achieve the goals of (1) international coordination and (2) improving the Shanghai Municipal Council's structure. For the sake of ensuring the election of the five candidates, it is necessary for every elector and their representative to go to vote. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Council sent out election certificates on the 4th, and it is estimated that they will be received by the 6th. Anyone who receives them should report to the Election Committee inside the Japanese Club on the 7th. If anyone is eligible to vote but has not received the election certificate or has not received notification from the Election Committee, they should submit a declaration or inquiry to the Japanese Election Office. The conditions required are: (1) paying a monthly rent of 60 yuan or more and paying 18% of the rent as property tax; (2) self-built houses with a value equivalent to a monthly rent of 60 yuan or more and a monthly property tax of 18% (the above two conditions apply to companies and factories); (3) if paying a rent of 300 yuan or more, and the person only rents one floor, paying a monthly rent of 70 yuan, and the cohabitant also pays a rent of 70 yuan, then, in addition to the person, the tenant also has one vote; (4) landowners whose land is valued at 2,000 yuan by the Shanghai Municipal Council and who pay an annual land tax of 8 per mille, amounting to 16 yuan, are also eligible to vote."</p>
<p>Two Candidates Speedily Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>(1) British candidate Mr. Mitchell previously requested leave of absence from the Shanghai Municipal Council due to illness and left Shanghai for recuperation. It is now learned that Mr. Mitchell has fully recovered and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in the coming days. (2) Japanese candidate Mr. Hanawa Yutaro, leader of the Japanese "Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry," returned to Shanghai from Japan on the Asama Maru yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Expressing Views One After Another; Announcing Platforms</p>
<p>British candidate, and current Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Cadett, and American candidate Mr. Heile also announced their platforms yesterday, explaining their aspirations. The details are recorded separately below. The gist of Cadett's speech was roughly as follows: "At this time of great change and extreme tension, I have been nominated as a British candidate. I deeply know that we have a great responsibility to the current society. I believe that the most important thing the Shanghai Municipal Council should pay attention to is the security within the International Settlement area, because Shanghai has become one of the world's</p>
<p>major metropolises</p>
<p>solely because of maintaining its security, attracting foreign confidence, and being happy to invest and develop commerce. In the past, the security in the Settlement area was truly commendable, so I hope that this state can be maintained in the future. Currently, various parties have criticized the Shanghai Municipal Council's huge expenditures, but in fact, without huge funding, it is not easy to maintain a major metropolis. I believe that all the institutions in the Shanghai Municipal Council, such as the police force, the health department, and the fire brigade, should be</p>
<p>maintained as they are</p>
<p>I resolutely oppose actions that are detrimental to their organization. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council's expenditures should be rigorously economized, it must be noted that economy is extremely important, but it should not affect its work. The needs, protection, and security of the residents are even more important than this. In addition, although I believe that the British expatriates have made great contributions to the establishment of the International Settlement, which is enough to boast about, I believe that the International Settlement belongs to all countries, not just Great Britain alone.</p>
<p>capable of governing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's responsibility lies in satisfying the needs of people from all countries and respecting and caring for their welfare. I acknowledge that the current situation has already changed, and Shanghai must develop under new circumstances. If I am elected, I will serve the happiness of the people of the society based on this aspiration." The gist of American candidate Mr. Heile's speech was roughly as follows: "I believe that we should not shrink back from the difficult situation currently occurring in Shanghai, but should always hold an</p>
<p>optimistic attitude</p>
<p>and believe that in the near future, after Shanghai overcomes this difficulty, it will still be a major commercial port that is one of the world's centers of trade. I firmly believe that we should do our best to maintain the administrative stability of this major metropolis, and recognize the complexity of the nationalities and ethnicities of Shanghai's citizens, and try to satisfy their needs. I believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council's police department and health department have had the ability to protect residents in the past. I</p>
<p>approve of gambling prohibition</p>
<p>and punishing unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate. Administrative cost should absolutely be economized, which should be the ultimate principle, but "cheap" and "economical" should not be confused. We should judge whether all expenditures are appropriate from the value of the administration. Therefore, if reducing expenditures affects public safety, then I cannot agree. I believe that spending should not be cut in public services, but the salaries of officials at all levels should be reduced. The administrative contributions that the Shanghai Municipal Council has made to us in the past should also be given considerable praise, and its administrative system should still be retained in the future. We should continue to move forward with courage and confidence."</p>
<p>Hanawa Yutaro Has Other Intentions</p>
<p>Japanese candidate Mr. Hanawa Yutaro also gave a speech yesterday, roughly saying, "Since the International Settlement is a place where people from all countries gather, it is of course 'international.' The existing Yangjingbang land regulations and the Shanghai Municipal Council's organization have many shortcomings. The most important of these is the lack of a trend toward 'internationalism.' Although people from all countries have different tax rates to the Settlement authorities, their contribution to the prosperity of the International Settlement should occupy a considerable position in administration, which is consistent. The most ideal situation is to give every resident of every country the opportunity to contribute their opinions to the Settlement's administration. I would like to warn people from all countries that due to the dictatorship of a certain country, disregarding the overall happiness of the Settlement's residents, it is impossible to make the Settlement develop and prosper. This 'internationalization' term is definitely not a request without reason. Although the International Settlement is currently called the foreigners' Settlement, Chinese people are still sent to represent the Settlement and cooperate with foreigners in the Shanghai Municipal Council. In the past, the distinctions between Settlement countries were simple, but today, all countries in the world have expatriates in Shanghai, so 'internationalization of the Settlement' can enable a 'harmonious' life between people from all countries and Chinese people. However, the current administrative power of the Settlement seems to be completely controlled by expatriates from a small number of countries. To 'internationalize' the Settlement, the current state should be changed. Today, candidates are embracing the idea of improving the current state of the Settlement and making it completely 'international.'"</p>
<h3>Export Cargo in This City Suddenly Subjected to Japanese Oppression; Flour, Tea, Iron, Ramie, and Other Items; Japanese Forcibly Order Permits</h3>
<p>The Japanese military has implemented control over all goods entering and exiting the areas they occupy in China. This has long been implemented in North China, Qingdao, Longkou, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Tianjin, and other places. Therefore, the above-mentioned ports have become barter trading sites. The ports along the Yangtze River, except for rice and steel, are slightly more relaxed. This city, due to its special circumstances,</p>
<p>was not notified to the customs beforehand</p>
<p>However, there have been illegal actions recently. Starting from the 1st of this month (April), exports of flour, tea, iron, ramie, and other items have been obstructed. There have been multiple occurrences in the past few days, with items being seized, penalized, and forcibly ordered to obtain export "permits." There was no prior announcement or notification to the customs. General customs brokers are lamenting this invisible damage, but under the power of oppression, they can only accept it helplessly. It is heard that on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 6th), two customs brokerages, Hehe Gong and Yixiang Gong, at a time when it was not convenient to implement, acted as agents for customs declaration, loading two barges of flour, approximately 3,500 bags, managed by Dong Huiji, onto the Danish ship Mansiman, bound for Yantai.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Police Arbitrarily Detained Them</p>
<p>As soon as the two barges left Suzhou Creek, they were spotted on the Huangpu River near the Bund Park by the Japanese Marine Military Police stationed at the Water Hotel. The two barges were then detained, and the flour could not be loaded for export. Although the two customs brokerages tried their best to dredge the situation, the outcome is unknown. Under these circumstances, the city's export trade will face considerable difficulties in the future.</p>
<h3>Salt Tax Reduction in Shanghai; Tax Reduction for Song Salt Entering the Settlement; Tax Reduction Orders Issued by the Ministry to Other Locations As Well</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, considering the inconsistent salt tax rates in various regions, originally intended to adjust them. However, in consideration of the increased burden on the people during wartime, the taxes that were originally light will not be increased for the time being, and the taxes that were originally very high will be reduced. They include:</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>(1) Zhejiang salt sold in Xiaonan, Zhunan, Jingde and other counties will be exempt from supplemental taxes of one or two yuan per dan. (2) Yue District, both Guibei and Shengpei salt, will be reduced from the original tax of 4.9 yuan per dan to 3.4 yuan. (3) The Yue District of Sanya Chang Haitou, land-based fish salt will be changed from the original tax of 3.4 yuan per dan to an attached Chang tax of 2.9 yuan. (4) Yue salt sold to Hunan and Yue shore through Gui will be exempt from the Gui province sales tax originally levied.</p>
<p>North China</p>
<p>(5) Yu District, Zhoukou Luohe is allowed to reduce the tax to 5.1 yuan per dan. (6) Anhui North Salt Affairs is temporarily handled by the Anhui Department of Finance, and the combined tax should not exceed two yuan per dan, and one yuan should be charged at the beginning. (7) Opening up the Qiannan salt sales area and canceling the Qian levy bank tax of 3 yuan per dan. (8) Shanghai concession Song Gu reduced from the original levy of 8.5 yuan per dan to 3.6 yuan. (9) Zhejiang District Ji'an and other four counties were reduced from the original levy of 7.4 yuan, and all were reduced to 3.4 yuan. (10) Various salts sold in the Shanxi District stopped collecting the national salvation donation of five jiao per household. In addition, production increase incentive measures were formulated to promote increased production in Sichuan Shaanxi Liangzhe Northwest Shaanxi and other regions separately.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Supplies Hot Water and Cheap Coal; On Sale Today; Flat Price Coal Per Ton; National Currency 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association has repeatedly handled the sale of cheap coal, and the results have been remarkable. After the stove owners purchased cheap coal, they resumed selling water. Now, the third phase of the association's flat sale is scheduled to begin today, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day. Stove owners can bring their original store brand and store stamp to the association's market at 405 Tianjin Road to apply for a coal purchase application. The flat price is 50 yuan per ton. It is reported that this time, Kang coal is still supplied by three larger coal companies, Yitaixing, Yuantai, and Huazhong, with 500 tons being sold until the quota is full. The Shanghai Mature Water Industry Association has informed all its members a few days ago to prepare funds to purchase coal, and will send representatives to the site to guide them at that time.</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations Actively Carry Out; Repatriation of Refugees; Current Number of Refugees Reaches 40,000; Fundraising Is Difficult; Funding Is Strained</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association and the Relief Branch have taken in a total of more than 40,000 refugees. In addition to being responsible for raising all the necessary funds for the shelters directly under its jurisdiction, the Relief Association is also responsible for providing supplies to the various shelters. Its total expenditure is more than 300,000 yuan per month. Currently, due to the difficulty of raising funds, there is a monthly shortfall of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The refugees in the shelters under the Relief Branch total more than 9,000 people, and its funding is also quite strained.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Creek Police Authority Issue; Meeting Convened Today; Discuss Several Important Management Methods; The Shanghai West "New Police Force" Will Also Be Consulted</h3>
<p>Regarding the Hongkou Police Authority Agreement, although it was signed recently by Fan Keling, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Miura, Japanese Consul General, several important issues concerning the management of the area north of Suzhou Creek and the appointment of police officers have not yet been resolved and are still subject to discussion by both parties. According to foreign sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council officials and the Japanese authorities have scheduled a meeting this afternoon to further implement the agreement. As for the preparation of the "New Police Force" in the Shanghai West off-road construction area, it is also said that a meeting will be convened this week for consultation.</p>
<p>Repatriation Work</p>
<p>The above-mentioned two major relief organizations are currently actively carrying out repatriation work. It is heard that the Relief Association plans to gradually complete this work by the end of June. The Relief Association's Aftercare Department has repeatedly received requests from refugees to voluntarily apply for repatriation. It is reported that those who apply for repatriation are mostly refugees who have been displaced from their homes, and their origins mostly belong to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, while others are from Guangdong, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and other places. Regardless of the distance of the repatriation location, the association can provide repatriation fees ranging from 2 yuan to 25 yuan per person in national currency.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficient Refugees in Relief Branch Shelters</p>
<p>The Relief Branch shelters are divided into two types: self-sufficient and non-self-sufficient. Refugees in self-sufficient shelters need to pay for cheap white rice. Currently, the Relief Branch will first repatriate the refugees in self-sufficient shelters, because most of these people are workers and peddlers who are already able to support themselves. However, according to reporters' investigation, these people are all from rural areas in the suburbs of Shanghai, who have no homes to return to and have taken refuge in the shelters, changing their occupations to peddlers and coolies to make a living. If they are repatriated out of the shelters, then their meager income will be difficult to maintain under the current price increases, and they fear that they will become vagrants on the streets.</p>
<p>The Old, Weak, and Disabled</p>
<p>Yesterday, a committee member of the Relief Branch said that the association plans to first give funds to the young and strong to repatriate them, and the remaining old, weak, disabled, and refugee children will still be taken in. However, fostering and raising refugee children will be the association's most important work, because children are unable to support themselves and need adult support. It is heard that an "Orphan Care" organization will be established in the future to educate and raise the orphans in the refugee shelters.</p>
<h3>All Parties Hope for Fellow-Provincial Organizations; To Transport Coffins Back to Their Native Places</h3>
<p>After the war, the population of Shanghai has surged, and the number of deaths has also increased proportionally. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, most of the coffins are temporarily stored in Shanghai, so funeral parlors and coffin storage facilities are booming. It is estimated that the total number of coffins stored in the coffin storage facilities and temporary burial grounds in Shanghai West is no less than 100,000. Shanghai is a small place, and having these coffins poses a major threat to public health, especially as the weather turns warmer. For the sake of public welfare, all parties hope that these coffin storage facilities and temporary burial grounds can quickly find a solution for the aftermath and evacuation. Currently, some coffin storage facilities have urged the families of the deceased to move the coffins back, but most have not complied due to transportation costs and other reasons. According to the information, there are relatively more guild halls and funeral homes in Shanghai for fellow villagers to store coffins. Because their locations are in the Chinese area, most of them were destroyed by artillery fire or occupied, so the storage of coffins by fellow villagers has been suspended. Now, all parties hope that these fellow-provincial organizations can come forward to organize group transportation of coffins back to their native places to assist fellow villagers in handling coffin transportation matters. The matter will be easier to handle, and the costs will also be reduced. As for the proposal of cremation for temporary burial grounds, it is restricted by customs, and opinions vary. The aftermath also needs to be dealt with urgently.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Fares Increase Again; Effective from the 15th; Gasoline, Tires, and Parts Are All Expensive; Staff Salaries Have Increased Sharply and Need to Be Remedied Urgently</h3>
<p>The China General Omnibus Company plans to increase fares again starting from April 15th. The new fares will be calculated on the basis of 6.5 cents per mile. It is said that this new fare is within the scope of the highest fare of one dime per mile. The company's</p>
<p>reasons for the price increase</p>
<p>are that gasoline, diesel, rubber tires, and various assembly parts are not only burdened more heavily due to the depreciation of the legal tender exchange rate, but even their prices in the place of origin, calculated in pounds and US dollars, have also risen due to the European war. In addition, the company has also increased staff salaries due to the high cost of living and is</p>
<p>issuing rice subsidies.</p>
<p>Another point that should be considered is that, according to the practice of public bus companies, a reserve fund for the purchase of various equipment must be set aside annually. For example, to prevent cars from becoming unusable over time, a certain amount must be set aside each year to prepare for the purchase of new cars in the future. If this "material liquidation" cost is calculated according to the original value of the items, it</p>
<p>cannot be supplemented and replaced at the current market price</p>
<p>Therefore, the calculation ratio must be increased, or the value of the items currently in use must be re-evaluated according to the current ratio. Therefore, for these reasons, it is necessary to increase fares.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Navy Suddenly Revoked the "Rice Purchase Permit"; The Japanese Army Expressed Dissent; Thousands of Chinese Laborers Made Futile Trips</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, according to news yesterday (the 6th), the Japanese Navy authorities in this city recently issued special "rice purchase permits" at the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps on Broadway Road (the original site of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company). Those who received the permit could purchase rice in the suburbs of Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday morning, more than a thousand poor Chinese people flocked to the address on Broadway Road to wait to receive the permit, which was very crowded, and traffic was blocked for half an hour. Although the office finally opened, only fifty "passes" were issued, and no more were issued. Many Chinese people returned disappointed. It is heard that the Japanese Army authorities learned of the Japanese Marine Corps' action yesterday morning and immediately discussed it with the senior commanders of the Japanese Navy. The order to issue the "passes" was then revoked by the Navy authorities, so it stopped after fifty were issued.</p>
<h3>Car Drivers on Business Trips; Request Concessions; Take Yunfei as the Standard; 45 Yuan Per Month</h3>
<p>The drivers of XiangSheng and other four major car companies that serve business trips asked for increased subsidies for wine. Since the negotiations on the 4th of this month were still ineffective, both parties agreed to hold meetings separately yesterday afternoon to study the matter in the long term. The parties will make a final decision after both parties have obtained the results. The labor party also announced at the time that it was difficult to delay any longer and that the capital party would give a concrete reply before yesterday. According to reporters from Pingming News Agency yesterday to visit the labor and capital parties, although the parties held separate meetings to discuss yesterday afternoon, the capital party still did not obtain a concrete result, so it did not reply to the labor party either. It is said that it will reply this afternoon. According to the results of the labor meeting, they did not insist on the wine subsidy issue, but requested that the wages be based on the Yunfei Company's standard, at 45 yuan per month, and not be calculated by the number of working days.</p>
<h3>Overview of the French Concession's Price Stabilization Plan; Price List; in Chinese and French</h3>
<p>The French Concession's Price Stabilization Committee held its third plenary meeting on the 4th of this month. It was resolved to implement three plans: (1) measures to improve the rice and coal market situation; (2) publish a price list and launch a public bulletin; and (3) force all retail stores to display prices. They have been submitted to the French Consul General for approval and implementation. According to reporters from Pingming News Agency, the content of these three plans is: (1) Forcing all retail stores to display prices means that each store must indicate the price per unit of each item sold in French or English, and Chinese or Russian. (2) Publishing a price list means that the prices of daily necessities in this port will be surveyed once a week and published in the form of a public bulletin as their average value. (3) The measures to improve the rice and coal market situation are still under study due to the complex situation, and the time to publish them has not yet arrived. In general, the Price Stabilization Committee has worked extremely diligently. The members of each group have to attend a meeting once a week, and the investigation of prices has been greatly assisted by the business community. Because the purpose of the committee's activities is not only purely to protect the interests of consumers, but also to properly protect legitimate businesses, it has been greatly supported by all parties.</p>
<h3>The US Government and Public Support for Chinese Disaster Relief; Determined to Fulfill Their Original Intentions; Donations from Overseas Chinese in San Francisco; An Average of 50 Yuan Per Person</h3>
<p>The US government and public support for Chinese disaster relief has never wavered from its original intentions. They are currently continuing to actively raise medicine and funds to provide relief to Chinese refugees. The main organizations involved are the American Red Cross and the American China Relief Association, and they are promoted jointly by all churches in the United States. The American people deeply sympathize with China's loyal resistance against Japan. Since the war zone is the largest and has lasted the longest, and the inland cities have all been bombed, they believe that it is most necessary to provide relief from a humanitarian perspective. Therefore, they are running around and appealing tirelessly. When the European war broke out, many believed that the United States would shift its focus to European refugees, and gradually reduce or stop providing aid to Chinese refugees. Now, the facts have proven this statement to be incorrect. In addition, overseas Chinese in various parts of the United States support the motherland's resistance against Japan, and their donations are extremely enthusiastic. In San Francisco alone, the average donation per overseas Chinese for the motherland has reached 50 yuan in national currency. Compared to our compatriots in Shanghai, there is still much room for improvement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female Ticket Sellers; All Dismissed</h3>
<p>The 43 Japanese female ticket sellers previously employed by the "China General Omnibus Company" were dismissed by the company authorities because their work was hard, their income was meager, and they could not endure the hardship. They requested the bureau to improve their treatment, but the capital party did not reply, and after a deadlock, reporters have now learned that those people have been dismissed by the company authorities, and most of them took a ship back to Japan the day before yesterday (the 6th). The rest are staying in Shanghai, planning to find other ways to make a living, because life in their country is even more difficult.</p>
<h3>It Is Difficult for Minor Puppet Officials to Make a Living; Resolutely Demand Subsidies; After Several Negotiations, Each Person Received More Than Ten Yuan; Puppet Officials Are Dissatisfied and Will Have Serious Representations</h3>
<p>Nearly a thousand low-ranking puppet officials from the "Political Affairs Office," "Police Bureau," and other institutions under the jurisdiction of the puppet "Municipal Government" in the Nanshi District, are struggling to make a living due to the meager treatment and high cost of living. Moreover, ordinary puppet officials have no security for their actions and are in danger of being sniped by guerrillas anytime, anywhere. Compared to the "new gentry" who are enriching themselves by looting and who are escorted by bodyguards and armored cars whenever they go out, there is a world of difference. The puppet officials are all indignant and filed a joint request with the Japanese puppet authorities at the end of last year to issue large subsidies and improve their treatment. However, the puppet authorities are experiencing extreme financial difficulties and are struggling to maintain themselves, so how could they have extra money to use as subsidies? Therefore, they resolutely refused at the time. Because they are struggling to make a living and have to endure danger, ordinary puppet officials often strongly stated that if their request is not granted, they will all resign and switch to other industries. The Japanese puppet authorities had no choice but to issue "bonuses" of more than ten yuan to each person at the end of last month after several negotiations to encourage them. However, the living subsidy has still not been resolved. It is now heard that the ordinary puppet officials are extremely angry about this, and it is feared that there will be serious representations soon.</p>

<h3>More Than 3,000 Trucks; Speeding Along the Highways of Southwest China; A Thousand Vehicles Were Purchased from New US Loans; Transportation in Southwest China Has Become Extremely Developed</h3>
<p>According to Vietnamese sources, the Chinese government used part of the US$25 million credit loan from the United States to China to purchase 1,000 trucks from the United States, which have been loaded and unloaded separately in Haiphong and Yangon. This batch of vehicles belongs to the Fuxing Trading Company, and 100 of them are already running on the Guangxi highway. The remaining 900 vehicles will join the highway from Kunming to Guangxi. The US credit loan is repaid with tung oil. According to this estimate, 4,000 tons of tung oil are transported from the interior to the commercial ports or the railway on the border of Annam every day. Together with the 2,000 trucks of the Southwest Transportation Company, the number of commercial trucks in the southwest has reached more than 3,000.</p>
<h3>The World Oppresses: Qu Bi Xiang's Jade Demise</h3>
<p>Marriage: Qu Bi, a woman from Pudong residing at No. 250 Caishi Road in the French Concession, was twenty years old this year. Her father had passed away, and she had an elderly mother, Ms. Lu (sixty-one years old), at home. She was currently studying obstetrics at the Tongde Obstetrics Hospital. Recently, due to dissatisfaction in marriage, she was often depressed. On the morning of the sixth, at ten o'clock, she went to her married elder sister Qu Huiyang's residence at No. 53 West Lane, Jianye Li, Fulili Road, to stay. Yesterday at noon, she suddenly had a momentary lapse of judgment and committed suicide by taking poison. At 1:30 PM, her brother-in-law's younger brother, Fan Yuwen, discovered her and immediately sent her to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save her life. The hospital reported the incident, and detectives were dispatched to investigate. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall autopsy room for examination and a detailed report was submitted to the court for inspection.</p>
<p>Argument: Li Xia, a Yangzhou woman, 25 years old, residing at No. 3 Taiheli, Buerbu Road in the French Concession, committed suicide by swallowing potion the night before due to trivial family matters. She was rushed to the hospital for treatment and was reported to be safe.</p>
<p>Unemployment: Zhang Gangsheng, 41 years old, from Jingjiang, residing at No. 2 Youde Li, Xujiahui, committed suicide by swallowing opium around 4 AM yesterday morning because he had been unemployed for a long time and could not make a living. His wife, Zhang Zhu, discovered him and sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Lovesickness: Li Like Laisi Qinggu, a Russian woman, 23 years old, residing at No. 697 Xiafei Road, committed suicide by swallowing potion in her bedroom at 7:45 PM the night before due to lovesickness. Fortunately, she was discovered and immediately sent to the Russian Hospital. She is currently still in critical condition.</p>
<p>Stimulus: Yesterday morning at 9:45 AM, Mrs. Ye Hu, a 24-year-old resident of No. 125 Chengdu Road, suddenly committed suicide by taking poison for unknown reasons. She was discovered and rushed to the hospital by car.</p>
<h3>Song Xingzhu's Flawless Jade: The Chastity Case Cleared, Three Examinations Prove Song's Virginity, Both Families Return to Good Terms</h3>
<p>Xu Guoming (also known as Shui Gen), a native of Yuxian, Zhejiang, residing at No. 55 Wuxi Road North, Shanxi Road, engaged Song Xingzhu (17 years old), the daughter of local gentry Song Fengshui, as his wife in 1927 through a matchmaker. Xu paid a bride price of a Zifeng Qianzhuang savings passbook worth 500 yuan. Later, Xu chose April 30th of last year to hold the wedding at the Tongxinglou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, and immediately telegraphed the Song family, requesting</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai on Schedule</p>
<p>to complete the marriage. However, Song Xingzhu did not arrive in Shanghai on time, so the wedding had to be postponed. It was not until August 1st that Song Xingzhu arrived in Shanghai accompanied by Ms. Ai. Xu Guoming's mother immediately prepared a new room as Song Xingzhu's residence. However, after entering the house, Song Zizhu was listless all day long and vomited after eating. After seeking medical treatment, she did not recover slightly after two months, and her abdomen had a</p>
<p>Bulging Condition</p>
<p>Xu then suspected Song of being unchaste, and that she was suffering from a ten-month illness. Therefore, he sent the girl back to her mother's home and retrieved the Zifeng Zhuang savings passbook he had paid (part of which had already been withdrawn by Song, leaving only 334 yuan). He then requested to dissolve the marriage contract. However, Song Fengshui argued that his daughter had absolutely no improper behavior. The reason for delaying the wedding date was that after receiving Xu Guoming's notice, while preparing to depart for Shanghai, they encountered</p>
<p>Shaoxing Being Sealed off</p>
<p>and detoured to Wenzhou to come to Shanghai. They also encountered Japanese planes dropping bombs and were unable to proceed. At that time, they telegraphed four times to explain the reasons for not being able to come to Shanghai, requesting that the wedding date be postponed. Therefore, the reason for delaying the wedding date was due to an irresistible force. As for the claim that Song Xingzhu was pregnant, it was a fabricated rumor used as an excuse to terminate the contract. In short, Xu Guoming had already found another girlfriend who had</p>
<p>A Huge Dowry</p>
<p>That Xu coveted. He did not hesitate to fabricate false rumors to achieve his goal of dissolving the marriage. Therefore, he rejected Xu's request to dissolve the marriage and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Xu Guoming for defrauding the savings passbook, accusing him of fraud. The result was a verdict of not guilty. On Xu Guoming's side, he also hired Qian Xingzhong and Zhao Zhibo to sue Song Xingzhu based on the</p>
<p>Unchaste Pregnancy</p>
<p>to the First Special Court, requesting the dissolution of the contract. Song Xingzhu also hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to present a factual defense and filed a counterclaim, demanding the return of the savings passbook. At the same time, in order to prove Song Xingzhu's chastity, she specially requested three examinations from Dr. Lu Shengqian of the Chinese Red Cross First Hospital and Tongde Hospital. As a result, all proved that the Song woman's hymen did not</p>
<p>Have a Ruptured State</p>
<p>There was no phenomenon of conception or pregnancy. At this point, the dishonorable facts Song had suffered were fully revealed. After this proof, the court immediately advised both parties to reconcile. Xu Guoming was also willing to publish a statement in the newspaper, and Song Xingzhu also understood. Xu then withdrew the lawsuit. A scene of suspicion over chastity was thus resolved, and Song's reputation was restored.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhuqing, a local from No. 15 Bili Nan Road, West Shanghai, is fifty years old and works as a farmer. Yesterday morning at approximately 2:30 AM, several bandits suddenly arrived, wielding weapons and intimidating him. However, Zhang refused to yield to force and resisted. The bandits stabbed him dozens of times in the shoulders and back with sharp knives, causing him excruciating pain and collapsing to the ground, bleeding profusely. The thieves searched and looted his belongings before escaping with their loot. Neighbors arrived and quickly summoned an ambulance to transport Zhang to the Tongren Branch Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Pirates Swarm at the Yangtze River Estuary: Foreign Ships Robbed Twice, Lidu Express Robbed at Liuhekou, Ship Searched Again at Yanglinkou</h3>
<p>Changyun Shipping Company of Guangdong Road, Public Concession, the Lidu Express (traveling between Shanghai and Xingang, etc.), fully loaded with passengers and goods, and carrying more than 200 passengers, with a tugboat in tow, departed from Pier No. 2 of the Bund at 6 AM the day before yesterday (the 6th). Around Liuhekou, they suddenly encountered a pirate ship carrying</p>
<p>More Than Ten Pirates</p>
<p>Six of whom, each armed with a Mauser pistol, jumped onto the Lidu. The pirates split up and went to the various cabins to rob the passengers individually. All suitcases and other luggage were pried open in turn. All valuable clothes and bedding were bundled up. Even the coats, robes, velvet headbands, watches, gold rings, gold bands, and cash worn by the male and female passengers were</p>
<p>Emptied</p>
<p>Even leather shoes, satin shoes, and woolen hats were robbed by the pirates. The ship's accounting room was also robbed of cash. The pirates, after obtaining their loot, boarded their pirate ship, untied the anchor, and sailed away. When the ship arrived at Yanglinkou, another pirate ship came. Four pirates, armed with Mauser pistols, jumped onto the ship and searched it. Knowing that they had already been robbed, they did not take action and left on their pirate ship. The ship</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai that Day.</p>
<p>Some passengers returned to the original ship because their luggage and travel expenses had been robbed. Dr. Chen Siming of Wanguo Dental Hospital, with more than ten years of dental treatment experience and based on scientific methods, produces Meiguang toothpaste and three-purpose tooth powder, etc., which are of high quality and low price, and are famous far and wide. Not only people in this port and inland areas are happy to buy and use them, but also Hong Kong, Annam, and the South Seas Islands are also very popular. It is heard that Zhao Jun, a Chinese overseas in New York, purchased hundreds of dozens a few months ago and transported them to the United States for trial sales. It turned out that within a month, all kinds of disguised goods were sold in the world's most prosperous cities, which is really a new phenomenon.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Regarding the news item published in today's (5th) newspaper about the truck (the driver was careless and knocked down a local girl named Cai Xiaomei, a student of the nearby Jinke Elementary School, causing fatal injuries), it has been verified that the girl is a relative of a student at our school, not a student at our school. However, the accident occurred near our school, leading to the misunderstanding. We hereby request that the correction be made. To the editor of the Shenbao Newspaper, Jinke Elementary School, April 5th.</p>

<h3>Baby Cries and Dog Barks Wildly, Nearly Causing a Fire: Parents Enjoy Nightclub, Get Wireless Report and Rush Back</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, a couple residing in Apartment 417, Riverside Building, Suzhou Creek, left their apartment on the night of the 6th, leaving their baby and a dog alone in the room. There was also an electric iron left on after use, with the power still on. Around 11:30 PM, the iron caught fire, igniting the wires. The baby cried incessantly, and the dog barked as well. A Portuguese tenant in the neighboring room became suspicious upon hearing the sounds. When there was no answer at the door, he summoned a Russian watchman to climb through the window and investigate. Seeing the fire, he urgently summoned three fire trucks to extinguish the fire. At the same time, he requested the radio station to broadcast and search for the whereabouts of the baby's parents. It was then learned that the couple was at a nightclub on Xiafei Road. After hearing the wireless report, they returned to their apartment at 12:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Old News Rehashed: Sixty-Seven Years Ago</h3>
<p>Number of People Traveling to San Francisco</p>
<p>Chinese ships traveling to San Francisco must pass through Japan. According to the Japanese Nikkan newspaper, in the sixth year of Meiji, which is the twelfth year of Tongzhi in China, a total of 5,417 Chinese people went to San Francisco in one year, and 5,974 people returned from San Francisco. Judging from their return luggage, in addition to large goods, they also had 500 to 600 yuan in cash. However, they had lived there for five to ten years.</p>
<p>Banning of Gu Embroidery</p>
<p>There are clothing rental shops in Ningbo, mostly selling women's clothing. They especially like to use lion and ball and other patterns from Gu embroidery from Suzhou. Last year, the clothing rental industry discussed that Gu embroidery was both extravagant and overstepping its bounds. Now, Du silk is used instead. Wealthy families who want to use it can make it themselves. Therefore, a public ban was enacted at the County Temple on December 18th of last year. Anyone who privately rents out embroidered goods will be fined according to this agreement. From now on, those who want to rent will not be able to enjoy the same extravagance and convenience as before.</p>
<p>Old Clam Produces Pearl</p>
<p>In the Lukia Guanyintang area outside the West Gate of this port, a farmer named Lu's eight-year-old child found a large clam weighing more than three catties near the river the other day. He suddenly felt abdominal pain and returned home holding his stomach. His parents gave him ginger soup to drink, and he recovered. His father opened the clam and found a bright pearl as big as a longan. The father was overjoyed, wrapped it in red cloth, and showed it to the neighbors. Some wanted to buy it for twenty silver dollars, but Lu refused. He brought it to the city's jewelry tea party for appraisal, and it was valued at sixty dollars, but he still kept it as a rare commodity and did not sell it.</p>

<p>Food, Clothing, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<h3>A Small Employee's Food, Clothing, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Three</p>
<p>I am a small employee of a large cultural organization. In this era of high prices, my monthly salary is only about forty yuan. The bureau only provides one lunch, so the actual treatment is less than thirty yuan. I am married, so in addition to my own life, I also have to maintain my wife's life. Now, I will describe the real situation of our food, clothing, housing, and transportation as follows:</p>
<p>Clothing: The current prices are at least two or three times higher than before the war, so in terms of clothing, we can't afford new ones. We can only use old ones or cloth made of native materials. For example, my coat and suit are all old clothes from a few years ago. If they are torn, we might as well mend them. If the collar and sleeves of the inner shirt are torn, we might as well modify them. If the undershirt is torn, we might as well sew up the tears, or even combine two into one. New underpants can be made of native cloth. When the weather is cold, we might as well wear Chinese-style pants inside our suit pants. My wife also wears clothes from her wedding. Sometimes, when we add some clothes, we also buy used goods or use existing materials.</p>
<p>Food: This item occupies the largest part of our expenses, but we strive to save money. Our meals are often one meat dish and one vegetable dish. Most of the rice is entrusted to people to bring from the guerrilla area, which is cheaper than in the isolated island. We also ask people to bring meat and other meat dishes from the countryside. In addition to some necessary vegetables that are purchased at the market, we also get soybeans, peanuts, broad beans, pickles, and dried radishes from our fellow villagers. Although coal briquettes now sell for more than six yuan per load, several of us share a stove and take turns cooking, which is still economical.</p>
<p>Housing: We live in a small room on the sixth floor, which is like a pigeon coop. The rent is only two yuan a month due to special circumstances. However, the neighbors are all poor people, and the environment is not very sanitary. But in our own room, we always keep it neat and clean. We often open the windows to allow air to circulate, so that carbon dioxide can be vented, and we are less likely to get carbon monoxide poisoning or other diseases. In the summer, because our residence is close to the Bund, my wife and I each buy a park pass and often go there to cool off at night, so even in the hot summer, we do not suffer much.</p>
<p>Transportation: Now that trams and buses have long been more expensive, and our income is limited, we really can't afford to take them. So, for places that are close, we have to walk. For places that are far, we also try our best to save on fares. For example, to go to Jing'an Temple, it costs nine cents for third class from the ball field to there, but I walk a distance and take the bus from the New World to Hede Road and get off, then walk a distance to Jing'an Temple. The destination can be reached the same way, but it only costs five cents. To go to Kangti Road, we don't take the public concession bus for that section, we walk to the Great World, and it only costs a dime for a round trip. As for my wife going to the market, she almost always walks.</p>
<p>By enduring such hardships, we can barely make ends meet with our meager income. We must endure, endure, endure, until dawn!</p>
<h3>Talking About Buttons</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Buttons (commonly known as button) are important accessories on clothes. Every piece of clothing cannot be worn without buttons. However, the amount of buttons used varies between men and women. Generally, men's clothes use fewer buttons, while women's clothes have many buttons. This is because women's love for beauty is very strong. In addition to the choice of clothing materials and the novelty of tailoring, they are also very particular about the style of buttons, such as Panxiang buttons and butterfly buttons. These were very popular in the past, but recently they are similar to the buttons on men's clothes, and they all use straight buttons.</p>
<p>The buttons mentioned above refer to those made of the same material as the clothing. For the sake of beauty, women can also choose another kind of satin material to make buttons. This type of button is suitable for long dresses or cheongsams. There are many other types of buttons, such as metal, shell, Bakelite, or animal bones and horns, all of which can be made into buttons. These are mostly used on short shirts, shirts, vests, etc. to show the novelty of decoration. In addition, there is a button, which is also mostly used on the clothes of women and children, and rarely used on the clothes of men. Furthermore, although buttons are sewn on clothes, they are not practical, such as the number of buttons under the cuffs of a suit (see the article "The Origin of Cuff Buttons" in this magazine on February 26) and the few buttons on the cuffs and lower back of a winter coat, which are completely decorations on the clothes.</p>
<p>Although buttons are very small objects, there is a sense of "courtesy" in them. According to the "New Life Movement," when wearing clothes, all buttons must be fastened, otherwise it is impolite. According to hygienists, pajamas should not have buttons. Soft straps should be used instead, so that sleep can be peaceful and comfortable. We might as well promote and imitate this.</p>
<h3>Can Mung Bean Residue Rice Fill the Stomach?</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>I remember that there was once a panic about "housing" on the isolated island, but this problem gradually subsided. At present, I think everyone on the isolated island is shocked by the seriousness of the "food" item, right? A load of white rice costs forty or fifty yuan, and it can only be bought by various methods. A bag of flour costs more than ten yuan, which is considered a "cheap sale." Think, with such a high cost of living, how can the general public not feel uneasy?</p>
<p>I once wrote an article in this magazine about the high price of rice, advising everyone to "save food," but this is too difficult to achieve in terms of "saving," and it should be implemented jointly by everyone in the entire city. Therefore, this newspaper's editorial mentioned urging the public to use the "saving" method in a passive way to tide over this difficult period, which is indeed a sharp comment. However, when "saving" reaches the point where it cannot be "saved" any further, the price of rice still occupies a high peak. At that time, perhaps we can only think of living on "substitutes" for food. Some people say that if you can't afford rice (referring to the high price), eat wheat. I say that if you can't afford wheat, eat porridge made of mung bean residue rice, which is also a good thing to fill your stomach. Now, let's talk about it:</p>
<p>Residue rice is rice grains that are broken and not in the form of rice grains. Like the Zhangjiakou area of North China, sorghum is used instead of residue rice and cooked with mung beans. I have tasted it personally and it is quite fragrant and delicious. In the South, there is no sorghum to replace residue rice, and the value is about the same. Fellow compatriots in difficulty, might as well try mung bean residue rice and see if it can fill your stomach?</p>
<h3>The Frugality Campaign During the Second European War</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shi</p>
<p>There's a Chinese saying: "If you cherish food, you'll have food to eat." The Western developed countries' frugality campaigns, based on scientific methods, receive widespread support and achieve remarkable results. It's observed that the promotion of frugality campaigns in the last thirty years has risen and fallen with global changes and economic tides. During times of war and economic panic, when resources are scarce, those managing households find it difficult to be like resourceful housewives who can cook without rice. Thus, fruit peels, meat bones, vegetable scraps, and fish fins all become valuable items that cannot be easily discarded. Scientists categorize and classify them, elaborating on the many important nutrients in waste materials that benefit people, and revealing the billions of dollars lost by people's inattention. At the same time, this sparks people's interest in science. Creating something from nothing, accumulating small amounts into large ones, wealthy families can share their leftovers to save disaster victims and refugees, and poor families can make the most of their existing resources to avoid waste. With this spirit and timely remedies, the Western countries view it as an essential strategy for preparedness. In our troubled Eastern nation, it should be seen as an unexpected benefit for our hardworking and patient compatriots who turn misfortune into blessing. The ancients often said, "How can we obtain thousands of grand mansions to shelter all the impoverished scholars of the world and make them happy?" I would like to change that to, "How can we obtain thousands of scientists to guide methods of frugality, or establish chemical factories to collect discarded food from each household, extract nutrients, and benefit the people, so that our unemployed and displaced compatriots can all smile, generate a hundredfold of spirit, exert a hundredfold of effort, assist the central government, and fulfill their duties as members of the nation." The following table shows the "calories" and valuable nutrients lost from various foods, as statistically analyzed by Western scientists.</p>
<p>The food items in the above table of twenty-four categories are specifically chosen from Western cuisine for research. The amount of "calories" food provides the body is related to the strength needed for daily work. Especially during the cold season, the poor should consume more foods with high caloric content to gain more energy from less food. Chinese rice and noodles provide a large amount of calories, unlike the low caloric content of Western bread. In Northern European countries where bread is consumed, it's necessary to eat meat to feel full. Vegetarianism is a luxury unique to those who eat rice and noodles. This demonstrates that the total "calories" obtained from daily food intake should never fall below the minimum limit. As for not using too much water when boiling potatoes, and not casually discarding vegetable soups, meat soups, and canned food juices, it's because they contain nutrients that are invisible to the eye. And the third type of vitamin (also known as Vitamin C) is easily destroyed by prolonged boiling. For the latest canned fruits and vegetables, advanced manufacturing plants know to purchase fresh ingredients rich in vitamins in large quantities. If consumers know to heat them before opening and not discard the remaining juice, they can sometimes obtain more nutrients than freshly cooked vegetables from their own kitchen. It is hoped that conscientious housewives in our country will frequently receive guidance from experts and create a separate table for the ingredients needed for Chinese dishes, following the format of the above table. In doing so, they can help others benefit and benefit themselves, and with a little effort, accomplish great virtue.</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Every year during the winter months leading up to the New Year, people often prepare large pieces of meat, which they preserve with salt and peppercorns. These can be stored for months without spoiling, and are then brought out in the spring around the time of the Qingming Festival to be eaten. After cooking, even the fatty meat appears translucent, and it doesn't feel greasy at all when you eat it. The aroma of peppercorns is also quite lovely. This type of meat is called preserved meat. Does your family prepare preserved meat during the winter? If so, now, during this Qingming season, is the time to enjoy it. The best way is to buy some fresh meat and stew it together with the preserved meat, adding bamboo shoots and bean curd knots for an excellent flavor. This dish is called "Stewed Preserved and Fresh," and while it may be a bit aristocratic, it's perfectly acceptable to enjoy it on a Sunday after working hard all week.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Brief Portrait of Mr. Cai</h3>
<p>— Jiang Menglin</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year Ji Hai during the Guangxu era, one evening with a bright autumn moon, honored guests gathered in the flower hall of the Shaoxing Chinese-Western School, with clinking cups and crossed plates, as if a combination of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering and the Peach Garden Oath were being performed at that grand event!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a refined and gentle scholar of short stature, elegant and romantic, in his early thirties, raised his wine glass high and loudly proclaimed:</p>
<p>"Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, their reforms are not thorough! Humph! I!..."</p>
<p>Everyone burst into laughter, and applause sounded like rain hitting plantain leaves.</p>
<p>This talented man had passed the imperial examinations around the age of twenty, becoming a Juren and then a Jinshi, and a compiler at the Hanlin Academy, a Xu Wenchang of Yuezhong in modern times. He could drink like the sea and his talent flowed freely. When it came to reading, he could read ten lines at a glance. When it came to writing, he could write a chapter after a jug of wine.</p>
<p>An older classmate told us this.</p>
<p>"This is our school's new supervisor, Master Cai Heqing, a talented man who is also a bit eccentric. Zimin is the name he changed to in middle age."</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's writing was very peculiar. In his provincial examination essay, there was such a striking sentence: "Indeed, food and sex are the greatest desires of human life." And he passed the examination with this essay. An old senior from Zhejiang who had also passed the imperial examinations once recited a large portion of this essay to me, but unfortunately, I only remember this sentence.</p>
<p>I remember the first lesson I received from Mr. Cai was on Fanqie (a method of indicating the pronunciation of Chinese characters). Bang, Bang, Pang, Mang. Dang, Tang, Tang, Nang, and so on. Mr. Cai said, "You must first know the characters when you study. This is Fanqie, which you should know when using a dictionary."</p>
<p>Two or three decades later, when Mr. Cai was the president of Peking University, the students were unwilling to pay the lecture fees, and their demands were fierce. Mr. Cai insisted on upholding school discipline and refused to compromise. The order was in chaos. Mr. Cai waved his fists and made gestures at the entrance of the Red Building, shouting angrily, "I'll fight you all!" The students surrounding Mr. Cai retreated one after another.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's daily disposition was gentle, as lovely as the winter sun. He rarely spoke harshly or looked sternly. He was composed and calm in dealing with people and matters. Whether he encountered high-ranking officials or those who peddled goods, his attitude remained the same. But when he encountered major events, his strong character was immediately revealed, and his words and writings were not to be agreed with lightly.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Cai's moderation was the moderation that could tread on a blade, not the moderation without any thorns.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's writing was usually as it should be, plain and harmonious. But when he encountered major events, his extraordinary spirit was immediately revealed.</p>
<p>"The one who stops my horse is the child by the road, the people are also tired, please allow a small rest." This was an advertisement Mr. Cai posted after leaving Beijing during the May Fourth Movement.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's way of living was based on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, rooted in loyalty and empathy. Knowing loyalty, he did not conform to the world. Knowing empathy, he was able to tolerate others and develop a broad-mindedness.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai rarely interacted with Mr. Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao) during ordinary times. After Mr. Liang passed away, Mr. Cai invited me to jointly propose a motion at the Political Conference, requesting the government to issue a commendation. This motion was automatically withdrawn due to Mr. Hu Zhantang's opposition. It can be said that no one in China is not unconsciously influenced by Lao Tzu. Mr. Cai was no exception. Therefore, Mr. Cai often held a "when the water comes, the channel is formed" attitude in dealing with matters. He did not compete with others for credit or with events for time. When others were impatient, Mr. Cai often said, "Take it slowly."</p>
<p>A talented scholar who was extremely famous in the era of the imperial examinations became a Confucian scholar in middle age. After studying in Germany and France, he vigorously promoted aesthetic education and science. When he was in the Ministry of Education, he advocated replacing religion with aesthetic education. At Peking University, he advocated that all learning should be based on science.</p>
<p>In the transitional era of China, he combined the strengths of both Eastern and Western cultures in one person. He established himself and helped others, based on this principle. Until old age, his ambitions did not diminish. Until death, his integrity did not change. We respectfully offer this elegy:</p>
<p>Great virtue will be passed down to future generations,</p>
<p>A complete man of China.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Breaking News Flies in from Afar, Lofty Discussions and Arguments are Human Faith</p>
<p>Qu Wushuang took a small can and went to the small tea room behind the editing room to make tea herself. The tea leaves were also genuine Mingqian tea leaves brought from Hangzhou by one of her old classmates. They were really a little thirsty, and it came at just the right time. As they chatted and laughed, they heard the restaurant on the second floor calling Qu Wushuang, saying: "It is now time for dinner. If Miss Qu's guests are all here, you can come down for dinner." Qu Wushuang replied, "Okay! We're coming." Today, these sisters had been able to see this newspaper office more or less. If they wanted to examine it in detail, a large newspaper office has someone in charge of each part, and with the guidance and explanation of those in charge, it would take three days and three nights to be able to understand everything in detail. Even Jin Danyu had accompanied foreign guests to visit before, but it wasn't as detailed as today. Because Chinese newspaper offices have been gradually improving in recent years, and European and American newspaper offices are also becoming increasingly advanced. When it comes to the progress of material civilization, the East may have some shortcomings compared to the West. Regardless of the type of material civilization, it is always first invented in the West and then promoted to the East. The newspaper industry is no exception. Therefore, when Europeans and Americans come to visit Chinese newspaper offices, it is nothing more than a fleeting glance, just seeing a general overview. However, there is one thing that has shocked Europeans and Americans, and that is the speed of progress since the Chinese revival, which is quite astonishing. Even Jin Danyu said: "When she accompanied foreign guests to visit here last year, she also went to see the machine room, and there were not as many printing presses as there are now." Naturally, because the newspaper sells so many copies, more printing presses need to be prepared. Now, this newspaper office can sell 1.2 million copies of both the evening and morning editions every day, and it is still growing. Of course, new machines will be added every year. At that time, they took the elevator directly to the dining room on the second floor. This dining room was also very large. In addition to the large hall, there were also small rooms. Today, Qu Wushuang had invited her sisters, so she booked a small room. Although it was said to be a small room, it was different from the large hall, and it was also very spacious. In the large hall, there were many staff members and editors of the newspaper who ate here. During the day, there were the most staff members eating here, and only a few editors who were working on the evening edition. For the evening meal, there were more editors than staff members. They would usually have dinner around seven o'clock, and after finishing dinner, they would proceed to the editing work period. Qu Wushuang's treat today was a very special feast. She also instructed the waiters in the restaurant to place various fresh flowers on the table. She was hosting this for Jin Danyu, the newlywed, and she insisted on putting Jin Danyu in the seat of honor. (260)</p>
<h3>Children's Gambling</h3>
<p>— Gong Ran</p>
<p>Children's hearts are the purest, so they are very easy to pick up bad habits. They are especially interested in gambling; the candy stalls in the streets and alleys are where they learn to gamble.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in a lane that, in addition to the gambling at the candy stalls, there was a group of older children sitting in a circle on the ground, using their schoolbags as cushions, playing "poker." They used round lead pieces about the size of copper coins as chips, and they were concentrating intently on the game, with winnings and losses reaching over five corners.</p>
<p>When I saw these scenes, I couldn't help but worry about the future of the children. They have picked up the bad habit of gambling, which not only affects their studies but also pollutes their minds and bodies. I believe that parents and teachers should take on the "great" responsibility of educating them.</p>
<p>However, many parents and teachers also play dominoes and mahjong in their spare time.</p>
<p>I shout loudly in the road, hoping that the gambling parents and teachers will quickly stop gambling; everyone should rise up and educate these gambling children. This is not only for the future of their own children and students, but also for the future of the country and the nation!</p>
<h3>Many a Little Makes a Mickle</h3>
<p>— Jing Jie</p>
<p>Now that children's books are lacking and children's libraries are still in preparation, isn't this just like the saying "not enough water to put out a nearby fire"? If someone were to call out and collect old books that people have already read and set up a children's lending library, open for public borrowing. It is best to hold it in different areas, which is more widespread. This is both economical and convenient. Although it is a stopgap measure, it is an easy thing to do.</p>
