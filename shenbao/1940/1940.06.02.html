<p>（一）橫行天下，專事破壞之「及姆斯」人，從污　中開始誕生！</p>
<p>（二）及姆斯越生越多，而且生出來就非常兇暴野蠻，其中一個頭目，正在計劃，預備進犯「天使國」</p>
<p>（三）天使國是一個充滿着自由快樂的國家</p>
<p>（四）兇暴的「及姆斯」軍已經開始出動，他們携带着刀槍等武器，鋒湧殺到天使國邊界討戰，天使國邊　守將，知事已吃緊，立刻下令抵抗！</p>
<p>（五）及軍開始攻城，天使國已萬分吃緊，守軍奮勇撕殺，前繼後仆，無奈及軍兇猛異常，城的一隅，終為突破！</p>
<p>（六）天使國守軍，已現不支，全部開始潰退，及軍衝入城內，大舉破壞，大好建築物頓成廢墟，從此天使國充滿恐怖殺氣，昔日昇平快樂，都成烏有，</p>
<p>（七）　　橫行城鎮居民，天使國不知幾許城市遭其同樣　　？</p>
<p>（八）戰事延續至一九四〇年二月「天使國」國運否極泰來，此時忽有一位米許林將軍出現，米將軍年靑英武，體力宏偉，手下練就一支，米許林鐵軍，實力强大，並世無敵，米將軍知祖國不少城市正在受及軍毒害，人民痛苦甚深，特下令動員，預備大舉反攻！</p>
<p>（九）二月八日上午十時，米許林軍開始出發前經，軍容威壯，各種機械化現代武器，無不齊備浩浩蕩蕩，向及軍巢穴直搗！</p>
<p>（十）米許林將軍已進至及軍陣前，大炮開始轟城，城內及軍睹狀大駭，慌亂異常，雖頑强抵抗，無如以卵擊石，十九喪生！</p>
<p>（十一）戰事激烈萬分，米許禁軍坦克車隊，步兵隊開始衝鋒，已進入城垣，大舉屠殺及軍，從此長驅疾進，所向無敵！</p>
<p>（十二）及軍遺屍遍野，喪亡殆盡，米許林軍凱旋歸來，人民歡欣若狂，高呼米許林將軍萬歲，從此天使國國强民安，任何敵人，已不能再行輕易進犯！</p>
<h3>說明</h3>
<p>人人都希望有一口晶瑩潔白的健全齒牙，但邕江幸，一旦被蛀菌所侵，則此後之痛苦，真如海深，蓋此種蛀菌異常凶强，他們破壞一個堅質的牙齒，等於像一羣野蠻的人，用刀槍侵入一個城市一樣！</p>
<h3>說明</h3>
<p>我人日常感覺牙齒疼痛或牙內發炎等等，則此種可怕之蛀菌，已在作崇，此時雖擬借用其他藥力，然已無濟於事，蓋蛀菌已漸漸深入齒內，牙磁琺瑯質均大受破壞，從此日坐愁城，不僅精神痛苦萬分，身體健康，也會蒙受無限打擊！</p>
<h3>說明</h3>
<p>牙齒與我人之健康，旣有重大關係，我人日常宜隨時善加保護，然普通牙膏，雖能白齒，或無殺菌力量，或則有傷牙磁，不能擔任護齒重任，致使蛀菌到處猖獗，患者痛苦呻吟，故吾人必須採用品質精細，殺菌力强之牙膏方能防止虫腐之侵蝕，保護牙齒健全</p>
<h3>說明</h3>
<p>米許林牙膏，係白檀香皂廠一九四〇年一鳴驚人之偉大出品原料高貴新奇，用科學方法精製而成，不僅芬芳潔齒，且殺菌力異常强大，其效能之宏偉，等於一支具有無上利器之現代鐵軍。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>東南歐的多角鬬爭</h3>
<p>近來隨着西歐戰况之激烈進展，義大利的態度，可謂已盡閃爍之能事。關於義大利將加入德國方面作戰之說，不但早已喧傳全世界，就是義國本國出版的報紙，也早在推波助瀾，渲染其說。但是到最近止，義大利終還沒有正式捲入戰爭漩渦，其主要原因之一，是由於義德之間，尚不免有矛盾和衝突之故。北方存在着一個强大的日耳曼國家，決非義大利之福，十九世紀以前一千年的義大利史，即其明證；所以在某一種立塲上說，墨索里尼母寧是不希望希特勒完全擊敗英法獨霸　歐的。但在另一方面，義大利畢竟是一個機會主義的國家，其立國精神又富向外侵略性；且義大利尤所顧慮的，即在假如長此保持中立，勢將减低其在歐洲國際間之聲威，旣不能在現行歐戰中取得重大的收穫，亦未易在未來和會中居於控制的地位，因此之故，現當德國在荷比區域進攻頗爲順利之時，義大利即將加入德國方面對英法作戰之可能性，實遠過於其續守中立之可能性。從種種方面推測義大利的未來參戰形態，也許將出之以「突擊行動」；其主要的「突擊」目標，當不外三處：（一）是瑞士或法義邊境；（二）是地中海上英屬直布羅陀。馬爾泰。塞浦留斯諸島，和法屬科西加，突尼斯諸地；（三）是巴爾幹半島。這三者中，巴爾幹富源豐裕，尤爲貧窮的義大利所久已垂涎。</p>
<p>但是巴爾幹的現狀，却極複雜，這也可說是使義大利遲遲未動的一個重要原因。當一九一四年第一次歐戰爆發時，巴爾幹是導火綫；戰後二十年來，巴爾幹本身仍未安定，而歐洲諸强亦多方謀繼續發展勢力於此；去年第二次歐戰開始後，巴爾幹區城的多角鬥爭更激烈展開。其一是德國，德國和東南歐的經濟關係，本來很深，德國食糧及重要原料的進口，可由巴爾幹各國供給其百分之五十（羊毛，麻，橡皮，棉花，咖啡除外）；加之德國要擊敗英國，非但須在西歐和英國作戰，並須在近東中東和英國角逐，則巴爾幹正是其束進時必須通過的道路，所謂「三B鐵路」（柏林——斯坦波爾——報達）的計劃，德國並未去諸懷抱。其决是英法，英法對東南歐的貿易關係較淺，但在巴爾幹各國的工業投資却多；而且英法要想在德國後方加以牽制，或想維護地中海上交通之自由，或保持其近東石油生產地之安全，都有賴於巴爾幹諸國之友好中立；所以去春德國併吞捷克以後，英法立即發表保障希臘羅馬尼亞之聲明，並於十月間和土耳其簽訂互助公約。其三是義大利，巴爾幹區域爲義大利食糧和原料的主要供給地；在軍事上則義大利要確保其東岸之安全，並維護其本國對東菲殖民地之交通，皆非先求控制巴爾幹不可；所以去年繼德國併捷之後，義大利即强占阿爾巴尼亞，並謀染指於南斯拉夫，近來義南關係非常惡劣，如十月十六日，義人即曾舉行大規模之反南示威。其四是蘇聯，自從第一次歐戰結束後，蘇聯對巴爾幹本來較採消極政策，但是去年德蘇協定的締結，加强了蘇聯在東南歐的地位；蘇聯素渴望能控制黑海南方門戶，以出入於地中海。現在正是她發展勢力的良機。其五是土耳其，二十年來，土耳其奮發圖强，隱然爲巴爾幹之領袖，土耳其的政策，重視外交，但不依賴外力保護，所以她於一九三四年聯合希臘，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫三國，共結巴爾幹協商，以求共抗侵略，亙保安全；今年二月，巴爾幹協商國集會於南國京城，即曾重申對於上項宗旨之信守不渝。</p>
<p>目前東西歐的多角鬥爭，至少已有上述五種勢力在角逐着。其中德國和英法，方以全力酣戰於西歐。博其生死存亡之國運；土耳其領導下的巴爾幹各國則限於實力。以言獨樹一幟，尚有不逮；所餘主要競爭者，厥唯義國與蘇聯。南斯拉夫本與蘇聯同其血統，鑒於義大利逼人之甚，上月己和蘇聯釋嫌修好，訂立商的；蘇土之間，邦交素稱敦睦；保加利亞亦爲斯拉夫混合種，先天性的易於傾向蘇聯。這是蘇聯所占的優勢。德國在蘇義間，本以調人自居，企圖促成其妥協，終以蘇義在東南歐的利害衝突不易消除，此項調解，迄今未有成就，其前途如何，　甚值重視。就最近二十四小時中所得的外電判斷，義大利之加入歐戰，已有箭　弦上之勢，果然，則這種東南歐多角鬥爭所造成的後果，無疑地又將嚴重影響到英蘇關係乃至整個歐洲大局的未來發展了。</p>

<p>歐戰背景</p>
<h3>使德辱命記（二）</h3>
<p>— 節譯漢德森爵士原著</p>
<p>五月間，余在德英協會宴會席上發表親德演說，企圖改善英德邦交，乃余便宜行事之第一次，其第二次即在九月間參加紐倫堡國社黨全國代表大會。英法美三國大使對此大會，向以其爲僅與黨部有關之非正式集會，每托辭避不參加。一九三七年大會，余及法國大使龐賽，美國代辦吉爾勃，奉本國政府訓令，首决出席，其時間僅以兩日爲限。希特勒見英法美三國外交代表聯袂蒞會，喜甚，對余個人尤加靑睞，蓋知此事出余發動也。</p>
<p>余於午餐席間，得與宣傳部長郭培爾，長談兩國報紙彼此攻詰問題。所談各節雖無新穎之處，但始終無解決良策，特郭培爾博士態度合理可親，有足多者。彼有「小博士」之稱，從腦力言，不失爲國社黨要人間之智多星。身平絕不演說？喜雄辯，私人間談時，心地　公正，余喜與交談。觀其品貌，實一典型的愛爾蘭煽動家。彼生於萊茵，曾在天主敎耶穌會學校肄業。身村瘦小，　足稍跛，但在柏林與共產黨人鬥爭，勇氣過人。登擅辯論或執筆爲文時，一切語句，無論如何惡毒，如何詭詐，要皆爲其得总之筆。</p>
<p>余旋與航空部長戈林長談，德奧合併問題雖曾涉及，但大部份時間，係懇其列舉所謂央國企圖包圍德國之具體的事實及德國　後目的何在。此事余前于七月間已向之要求提出書面答案。戈林雖常準備與余一談，並願發表意見，以待「希特勒核准」，但此種書而答案究屬一種空想。第在此次談話時，戈林曾邀余於十月初問，往東普魯士羅明頓行獵，謂屆時或有消息見告。余慨然尤之。</p>
<p>戈林，常能言無不盡，有時且甚憤慨，但余與開誠佈公交談多决，彼此態度，均甚和洽。其爲人不若希特勒與里本特洛浦之恒爲私怨所激動。其於英國，確具和平相處及敦睦邦交之誠意，但亦曾向余警告，謂不列顚帝國若不與穗合作，則德國唯有加以毀滅耳。</p>
<p>一九三三年縱火焚燬國會一案，或係由其嗾使，一九三四年淸黨時大舉肅淸柏林工作，係希特勒委其主持。彼在平時，雖不愧國社黨要人中最富同情心者，但一遇危急，輒殘酷與作戰無異。彼嘗告余，彼所崇拜之英國人乃德類克之類「海盜式人物，現代英國人已過於失去剛强。實則彼亦典型的海盜，但其品性，可愛之處甚多，余在私人方面實最喜其人。</p>
<p>戈林軼聞甚多，大致以其愛好勛章爲笑柄，要皆無損大雅。由余視之，彼曾於一九三八年鼎力斡旋和平，其見羲勇爲之骨氣，若能與肉體上之豪放，相輔而行，則在一九三九年，彼或仍能保全大局也。</p>
<p>十月初，應的赴東普魯士羅明頓行獵。戈林招待甚慇懃。別墅以草葺爲頂，屋內設備舒適，應有盡有。侍應均女僕，男僕僅一人，賓主出入不拘禮節。陽光晞微中，余驅車至，午後四時，相偕整裝出獵。出發時，戈林謔余曰，英國人雖善用獵鎗，但不諳步鎗。一星期前，曾邀一英國獵人打鹿，三發未中。</p>
<p>余聞言如冷水灌頂，但並不沮喪。比至林中，瞥見一鹿，余發鎗中其心，翌晨余又一鎗中一頭，英人善獵之令名因得保全。盤桓兩日，樂而忘返。大自然中，旣無所謂國家主義，又無所謂社會主義，唯一感想，厥爲一切人類皆平等而已。</p>
<p>先是，戈林會籌備於一九三七年十一月在柏林舉行獵狩展覽會。余到任後始知歐洲各國殆均準備參加，獨央國不與焉。余急電外務部，請即籌備加入。爲時雖遲，但幸得趕上。</p>
<p>德國人組織力甚强，獵狩展覽會成績甚佳。希特勒雖不喜行獵，並在原則上反對殺害各種動物，但亦勉强蒞臨參　。戈林則深以英國與會爲快。</p>
<p>抑有一事與此會有特殊關係，值得大書特書者，即樞密院長哈里法克斯動爵，（時已內定調任外相），得乘機一游柏林是也。爲避免外界誤會起見，此行會以私人性質出之。策動其事者則爲張伯　先生，擬籍英穗兩國要人時相過從之機會，促進邦交，用意良善。</p>
<p>希特勒對于哈里法克斯勛爵目光遠大態度誠懇，深爲感動。即德國一般民衆亦以此行足以表示英國對德誠意。惟黨政界人士則仍冷淡。事後，戈林詢余曰，「張伯倫首相眞有意乎。其眞能轉換英國反國社黨派心理乎，眞能不抄襲國聯會，集體安全，及法國之包圍政策等老文章乎，」此乃德國方面觀察英國政策之正統思想。希特勒雖曾迭次宣佈，願與英國言歸于好，但亦口惠而實不至。彼深知尚有併吞奧國等急務在，何能犧牲其中歐野心，以換取此種諒解。彼心目中所謂英德修好乃英國接受其改造中歐計劃而巳。</p>
<p>一九三八年一月十二日，穗報披露國防部長白侖堡將軍與一名葛蘿女士者締婚，此爲德國內部發生悲劇之序幕，要非言之過甚也。前一晚，余應宣傳部决長現任經濟部長兼中央銀行總裁芬克之邀赴宴於宣傳部。席終，芬克以白侖堡將軍與葛蘿女士婚事宣佈，舉座六十人左右，咸爲之愕然，莫不以葛蘿女十底細相問。旋悉政治警察局中有伊紀錄。蓋一放浪不覊，而又艷美之女子也。余私忖，此事殆出於陰險的政治警察局長希墨萊冀以排斥異已。</p>
<p>希特勒一巳情感，及其聲望，因此大受打擊。白侖堡不僅爲希特勒最親信之一人，孰料患生肘脥。希特勒擬以白侖堡受人之愚爲詞，諷令解除婚的。白侖堡不聽，希特勒乃不無衆叛親離之慨焉。</p>
<p>國社黨部與白侖堡情感融洽，初無間言，惟陸軍將領則不然。黨部急進派，父因其對若輩干與軍事亦與之不諧。陸軍總司令弗立區將軍，受諸將及上决大戰宿將麥剛森等之贊助，不待希特勒如何處置，逕回元首進言，謂白侖堡以國防部長之尊，竟下儷放佚之女，軍紀蕩然，是孰可忍。雖然，獨裁者何能容他人指揮耶。希特勒一面不願爲他人所左右，一面又爲示篤誼於老友起見，其初對於白侖堡之免職，堅拒不可。弗立區得寸進尺，不僅抨擊軍紀問題，即於希特勒之外交政策，尤其是對奧政策，亦且大肆非議。斯則決非希特勒所堪忍受者矣。</p>
<p>其後，弗林立區去職，白侖堡亦然。當時希特勒所深思熟籌者，即如何措置，而於已有利，至少能不失顏面。三星期後，即二月四日，希特勒於是年第一次盛怒之後，公佈此兩要人免職，同時以陸軍，海軍，空軍，及外交人物之調動昇黜，作爲烟幕焉。特除外交界外，此一批人員之調動，祇弗林立區與白侖堡之去職，尚引人注意其餘諸人，須數個月後，遷調也。厥後希特勒即軍權獨攬矣。就大體言，希特勒衝破難關，手段不可謂不敏捷，目將陸軍中之帝制派保守派，一掃而空。保守派外交部長牛賴特亦由極端派人物里賓特洛甫代之矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>法大使即將北行　建議媾和說無稽　對中國政策一貫決不變更　法租界力旦充沛治安無虞　美大學敎授主張積極制裁日本</h3>
<p>本埠日來受歐戰擴大影響、以及某方造謠、一般居民、幾為流百所中、羣起猜疑、平明社記者昨特往訪法大使館發言人、叩詢種種、承其懇摯之答覆、據稱、法為民主國家、中國亦爲民主國家、在過去邦誼上、甚爲密切外傳法大使建議媾和說、絕對無稽、</p>
<p>外部否認　與日媾和</p>
<p>美國合衆社重慶一日電、外交部　言人、頃對最近羅馬無　電所傳中國之駐英駐法　德大使曾共同建議及早與日本媾和、俾加入歐戰軸心國家之說、堅決否認、發言人稱、不特中國駐外使節、絕無此種建議、且自歐戰發生以來、中國之政策、迄未有所改變、發言人　羅馬之消息、必係來自日力希圖淆惑世界視聽、</p>
<p>北行南返　即赴重慶</p>
<p>對於中國現時處境、表示十二萬分同情、法國政府、無論如何、決不變更以往一貫之政策、南京組織、爲日方一手製造者、日尚且不能予以承認、何况其他、現大使在滬憩夏、無非照例視察當地法國外交機關辦公情况而已、本月或出月間、或將赴平津一行、探訪友朋、一俟南返後、即仍赴中央政府所在地重慶、外間所傳法大使有勸蔣總裁和平說、實不足置信、</p>
<p>法租界守　中立態度</p>
<p>至於本埠法租界治安問題、決可無虞、因駐滬法國防軍　警力、儘可應付外來不幸之任何事故、最近復加強各處之保衛措施、如自來水廠·電燈廠等一切有關公用之機關、防守尤為加緊、雖有不良份子及所謂德國「第五縱隊」希圖擾亂、亦可決其必不得逞、且法租界完全嚴守中立態度、即四百餘家之德僑寓居界內者、如彼等安居樂業、不參加任何反英法之任何政治活動、當局亦至於寬容、仍任其繼續留居、不加干涉、</p>
<p>日盼結束　中國事變</p>
<p>據本埠伍德海氏（H．G．W．Woodnead）主編之英文「東方大勢雜誌」（Oriental　Affairw）六月號發表「日本與南京政權」一文曰伍氏於此文中首稱、日本承認南京組織、尚須有待、阿部及其部下多人、雖於四月二十三日抵寗、但在新聞報道上、並未佔顯著地位、故某日文報、曾對此加以抨擊、並稱熱烈冀望日當局對於結束「中國事變」方面有所進展、俾日本得自由應付　戰中發生之種種問題、同時重慶國民政府、仍繼續斥資南京組織、至於謠傳中日談判媾和之說、全無根據、最近有人由渝返此、稱國民政府、繼續施行抗戰政策、愈戰愈强、經濟軍事方面、均日益强大、最後伍氏謂、日本斷不至於在其他地方　行冒險進攻、蓋日本在華進行大規模軍事運動、已深陷泥沼、不能自</p>
<p>美應穩定　遠東局勢</p>
<p>美國哥倫比亞大學國際關係敎授皮法氏（NathanieLPffer）、最近投文哈柏雜誌（Harper's　Magazine）、極力主張美國立刻取積極方策、制止日本對華侵略、美國應進一步、對日實施經濟制裁如此方可弭除東亞戰爭之　大、美國對歐戰、在思想上或行為上均已放棄中立、並已實行</p>
<p>供給軍火</p>
<p>於英法、蓋將來德國如獲勝利、對於美國利益有碍、而在遠東亦然、日本如控制中國成功、亦對美國有害、日本目前不敢利用歐戰、掠奪英法在華之權益、即因恐懼美國態度強硬、日本於一無辦法之中、製造偽組織、而其實施之計劃、即承認該偽組織爲「合法政府」、然後與之締結「和平條約」、然後慫恿該偽組織</p>
<p>收回租界</p>
<p>及第三國旣得權益、故英美法政府應警告日本、不得如此倒行逆施、否則一致加以報復、日本企圖排斥外人在華權益之動機旣顯、則美國當局應　採取　動地位、對日應擴大實施道德制裁、如情形需要對軍用原　如火油五金機器及棉花等、　一律</p>
<p>禁止運日</p>
<p>對於輸美之日貨、亦應科以重稅此種措施、即　阻止日本侵華而有餘過去十年中、日本擴張　略、在太平洋上伸張勢力、予　國以最大威脅、現日美雙方均努力充實軍備、情形緊張得　曾有、故美國對日應取積極行動、穩定遠東局勢、待英法　　後、與各國一致壓迫日本停止侵略戰爭、撒退所有在華軍隊同時美應援助中國建樹獨立國家之基礎、</p>
<h3>日光節約第一日　全巿一致推行　各機關各業均用新時刻　時鐘未撥快者提早辦公</h3>
<p>自公共租界工部局法租界公董局佈告寶行日光節的運動後、上海市商會已通告各業一致依行、洋商銀行公會華商銀行公會以及錢業同業公會、昨日起已實行、所有一切收解、均照新時刻辦理、各市塲如黃金·匯兌·證券·雜糧·豆米·棉布·紗花，錢業等、昨日起依照新時間辦理買賣、各學校均自動提早上課、</p>
<p>公共事業</p>
<p>昨為開始實行日光節約之第一日、關係公共福利之各種社會事業均一律將鐘點撥快一小時、公共租界法租界之有軌無軌電車及公共汽車皆於新鐘點之淸晨六時、即舊鐘五時行駛、電燈公司例於每日下午四時試火、今則試火時正舊鐘三點、商界對此運動迄昨顯分兩派、維新者皆相率遵守新時刻、守舊者仍未將鐘針移動、好在新舊鐘點之標準時鐘亦各有一處、以後欲知準確之新時刻者、可對跑馬廳之大鐘、而舊時刻則除外灘之江海關大鐘外、北四川路橘北堍郵政總局門墻上之鐘、亦未撥快、據上海郵局消息、自本年六月三日起、管理局曁本埠各支局之辦公鐘點、均分別提早一小時、但　不發快時鐘、</p>
<p>開庭時間</p>
<p>第一第二兩特區高地各法院、昨日雖未一律將鐘點撥快一小時、但因刑事案件多係捕房公訴、各捕房依照新鐘點押解案犯到院、代表起訴之捕房律師、亦照新鐘點到院出庭、故法院之刑事庭開庭時間照未撥快鐘點、則較往日提早一小時、惟各級民事庭之開庭時間、因預先發出各案傳票上所載猶屬舊鐘點、而應傳之人、更非一體遵行新鐘點者、是以仍以舊鐘點爲開審之標準、大概此項時間上參差不一之情况、不久自能趨於一致、緣暑期轉匯將屆、各法院向例每值暑季提早一小時辦公、此則與今日實行之日光節約、不謀而合也、</p>
<p>宵禁鐘點</p>
<p>關於兩租界宵禁時間、於昨晚起、依照新鐘點十二時三十分起實行宵禁、（即老鐘點十一時三十分）、前晚之一時三十分宵禁、仍係脊禁更替時臨時辦法、昨晚已不適用、</p>
<p>海關郵局　實際實行</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海已從午夜起、實行日光節的時間、惟外灘江海關大鐘及四川路郵政總局大鐘、皆照舊朱改變時間、致與一般時計相差一小時、而使商業區</p>
<p>稍起紊亂、據郵局長乍配林稱、渠未接關於日光節的計劃之通知、故隨江海關辦法而不改變郵局大鐘之時間云、惟江海關與郵局僱員、則巳照日光節的時間辦公、又據江海關稅務司羅福德稱、目前不擬改變海關大鐘之時間、惟海關僱員皆照日光節的時間辦公、一說海關大鐘必須採用日光節的時問、目下該鐘</p>
<p>落後一時、不能推諉於中政府之阻撓、因中政府管理下之本市兩租界華方法院、今日（一日）皆已採用日光節的時間也，聞本市　海軍當局及入口美艦亦迅將遵守日光節的時間、</p>

<h3>日偽威脅白俄　强迫一致反共　策動另行組織俄僑團體　不入會者將被取消護照　原有俄僑委會被迫解散</h3>
<p>據外人消息、日偽方面、對本埠白俄僑民、近又作進一步之控制、「偽市府」方面、業已將原有白俄僑民委員會解散、而代以虹口匯山區之白俄為領袖、另行組織、「白俄僑民團體」、凡為該會會員、均須反共、此項規定、業已由日人卵翼下之俄文RUSS報發表文告、該報警告俄僑、「凡不加入該會之俄僑、將被取消護照、不得在滬居住、及其所享受之公民權益」、此項新組織、定於本月十五日成立、原任白俄僑民委員會主席曼脫滋勒、將被免職、而由現任俄人商業學校教員之鳩孟納哥取而代之、前在哈爾濱為俄僑法西斯聯合會領袖之哥斯明、將與鳩孟納哥同主其事、</p>
<p>過去教訓</p>
<p>本埠俄僑團體、對此均極驚異、蓋哈爾濱天津及北平、由日人牽綫之白俄反共運動、已使彼等寒心也、蓋在上述諸地、日人幾為俄橋團體之獨裁者、俄僑在其淫威之下、均已喪失其自由、此等俄僑團體領袖、多為卑怯無用之輩、由日人授意、策動俄僑袒日反共、天津俄僑、時有以思想枘鑿而失蹤者、尤屬駭人聽聞、上海本為俄僑自由安全之區、今竟遭此厄運、俄僑自不能引為深憂也、</p>
<p>負擔甚重</p>
<p>據RUSS報所載、新俄僑團體之組織、大抵如下、主席鳩孟納哥秘書亞可失金、會計科主任哥斯明、註册科主任裴滋鄧尼可夫、扶助科主任克柴可夫、該會會址則在西華德路四〇五號、鳩某除負責會務外、又負責主持俄僑團體之教育文化活動、該會規定、如會員不繳會費至三個月者、立即取消其會員資格、會費徵收、則以會員每月收入為標準、每月收入在一百廿九元以上者、每月須付百分之〇五、一百五十元以上者、每月須付百分之一、三百五十元以上者、付百分之一·五、此後凡增加一百元、即須增付會費百分之一·五、</p>

<h3>德國信號雜誌　租界並未禁售　英航空協會宴法軍司令　協約國人踴躍獻金祖國</h3>
<p>日前某某報載有公共租界警務處禁止德交「信號」雜誌（Dro　Signal）在租界銷售一節　茲據警務處聲明　並無其事、</p>
<p>所謂禁售　事出誤會</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於日前報　德國英文雜誌名「信號」者、被公共租界警務處禁止發售　訊、有所誤傳、事綠某新聞記者赴四川　某書店時、適有穿制服之英籍警員一名入店、　店員不得復售「信號」雜誌、該記者乃記警務處禁售「信號」雜誌之新聞一則、</p>
<p>另一書店</p>
<p>亦稱、日前有英警員兩名來店、　「信號」雜誌已禁售、言畢、携該雜誌兩份而去、總代售「信號」雜誌之德商書店、聞工部局已函覆、調局方及警務處對於此事、毫無所知、並承認警員無權以普通國民的</p>
<p>政治見解</p>
<p>為根據而禁止任何出版物、而警務方面、則　調查書店、乃「非正式」　質、惟本市主要德僑對此頗為憤懣、因「信號」雜誌、雖可認為德方宣傳品、但不能以煽動刋物自之、故</p>
<p>德僑方面</p>
<p>或將提出正式抗議、其理由為英警員濫施警力、對德方出版物抱歧視態度、且德僑方面以為「信號」雜誌之挑撥性、遠不及若干親協約國而准許自由出售的出版物為甚、</p>
<p>英航空會宴法司令</p>
<p>英皇家航空協會主席沙遜爵士、為慶賀該會會員但維空軍員、於最近在歐洲西綫作戰獲獎、於五月三十一日、假該會滙豐大厦會所、舉行餐叙、並折柬相邀法在滬海陸軍高級長曁法新任陸軍司令愛蘇　夫大佐、前日之宴、可謂英法聯合陣綫之歡叙、沙遜爵士並藉以歡迎愛大佐榮長此間法軍防務、爵士席間　申述協約軍之同力抗戰、以及茲　協約軍之所負責任益重且鉅、對愛大佐之參加、表示歡迎、　會員但維之獲政府獎章、尤表慶賀、按但維現年二十歲、襄昔曾肄業九江路大英禮拜堂學校、卒業後、加入空軍隊、此次戰事猝起、但氏即加入前綫作戰、最後由夏大佐致答謝詞、大佐曾言及英法空軍在前綫艱苦作戰情形、</p>
<p>意國總會突然出售</p>
<p>據可靠方面探悉、馬　師路二百八十五號意大利總會、已於前數日內　予上　護畜會、一般人深信、或因意國行將參戰、深恐其在法租界內產業、將因敵對國關係而遭沒收、故突有此舉、</p>
<p>本埠法僑祈禱勝利</p>
<p>法文上海日報云、前日（五月卅一日）為三日祈禱之最後一日、上午九時舉行彌撒、為法國祈禱勝利、由杭州教堂主教戴米　主持典禮、　場參加者、有法大使戈思默夫婦·比大使紀佑穆夫婦·波蘭代辦羅賽夫婦·荷蘭代辦白斯凡·法領事奧仁·央總領事喬治·比總領事凡巨森夫婦·法駐軍司令愛蘇第大佐·「加爾尼」軍艦艦長魯賓·上海法軍指揮官阿狄哥·及法租界公董局巡捕房各高級職員等多人、</p>
<p>德輪水手好整以暇</p>
<p>昨日盛傳德國「第五縱隊」、在停泊浦江中之德輪雷　斯號上舉行會議、茲已證實不確、爰以歐戰發生後、德船被迫祗能停泊中立口岸、雷米號水手、深感閒散無俚、乃向本埠德僑划船選手挑戰、即於昨日在雷米斯號停泊地點附近法租界外灘及南市相近水面、舉行划船比賽盛會、</p>
<p>華懋飯店取消樂隊</p>
<p>歐洲　事邇來愈趨激烈、本埠協約國　民　多實行儉約獻金祖國、如法在滬退伍軍人協會等已分頭勸募軍需公債五十萬法郎、俟足數後、即行匯在本國、此外并悉華懋飯店已於前日自動取消設置之樂隊、以符儉約意義、</p>

<h3>溫洲港被封閉　無限期不准第三國船隻駛入　日方曾用武力阻止外輪進口</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（三十一日）悉、中國自由港溫州、巳被日海軍當局對閉、無限期不准第三國船隻駛入、航行沿海各船、於五月二十二日首决得悉此事、</p>
<p>開槍阻航</p>
<p>緣是日有Argonaut號輪、擬駛入溫州、即有日方武裝馬達船開槍、槍彈飛過該輸頭部、然後有日軍官一員登輸、勒令該輪在港外寄椗、聞有英商小船一艘、夜間熄燈試圖穿越日方封鎖、的在同時駛上泥灘擱淺、</p>
<p>改駛他處</p>
<p>目下駛往溫州之船舶、皆改駛他處、因日海軍巡邏船控制該處、較控制溫州有效、而第三國船隻駛溫州、向例白畫泊港外、入夜則穿過封鎖綫也、</p>
<p>恐嚇手段</p>
<p>按數週前、本市日海　發言人曾警告第三國船隻、謂破壞港務規則事、迭有所聞、如小顧日海軍信號、及夜間熄燈人港等是、日後復有破壞規則者、幾將自食其嚴重後果云、</p>
<h3>南巿停發「居住證」　復使用通行證</h3>
<p>偽「市府」在市商會舊址所設之「特區辦事處」、原祇辦理發給通行證事宜、但領證者倘欲當日領得、則每張須耗小費由一元至三元不等、如不給付、該經辦「職員」必予留難、最速三日之後、方能領取、雖經偽「市長」於春初發貼「佈告」、取消領證手續費、然亦僅「官收」變爲私索而已、迨日方開放南市、一般無力負擔租界昂責房租之人、因聞城內房金低廉、頗多遷往居住、該「辦事處」另設一發給「居住證」櫃檯、此證之有效期間、較通行證長久、領時母需費用、且偶亦可充通行證行使、是以近月以來、請發「居住證」者銳增、而通行證之銷數激减、管理發通行證之「職員」、直價大受影響、彼此暗潮逐漸猛烈、惟管理通行證方面、與偽「府」淵源比較深切、對方雖亦竭丈活動、結果似告失敗、該發給居住證之部份、茲已「奉令」結束、以後南市居住證是否續發、抑另一設「機關」辦理、尚無所聞、現在發通行證方面、爲表示「潔巳奉公」起見、對於小費、不復收受、然亦不尤「當日取件」、並須領證者親携各種證明物件、自赴該處「聲請」、俟其發出、當需三日、故此後專以代領通行證爲業之人、其業務將連帶稍蒙影響矣、</p>
<h3>甬方擬加徵水脚五成　旅滬甬人反對　主張多募捐款先墊五十萬元　已訂購一萬八千包裝輪駛甬</h3>
<p>虞洽卿氏　寗波商會主席周大烈函云、寗波民食恐慌·已呈嚴重階段、若不設法救濟、前途殊堪殷憂、惟滬米及洋米價格甚高、每石擬補貼二三十元、且距新穀登塲爲時尚須三閱月、是項貼費、以鄞慈鎭奉四縣計算、的計二百五十萬元之巨、甬上勸募款項、雖經竭力募得三十餘萬尤、杯水車薪·無濟於事、是以擬將滬甬輸船來回</p>
<p>增收水脚</p>
<p>百分之五十、藉以彌補、此為不得已之舉、亦以取之於民用之於民之意、先生以爲加重客商負擔、意有未然、惟甬上財力有限、前項勸募之數、業已搜維殆盡、巳屬募無可募、倘不將水脚增收、其他別無辦法、然民食問題如此嚴重、又萬難因此中止、輾轉思維、究竟如何辦理、方爲妥善、使民食問題得有相當之解決、先生爲邦國元老、誼切桑梓、尚祈見示方針、俾資有所遵循、虞氏當復函云、寗波民食救濟會先議進出口各貨、一律值百抽五辦法公佈以後、旅滬回鄕對於此項抽釐辦法、咸認不期適當、一致</p>
<p>表示反對</p>
<p>今者又改議將進出口水脚增加百分之五十、雖名目更改、而加重人民負擔則一、在無法籌款之中而出此策、然流弊甚多、同鄉會曾一再加以討論、僉願旅滬同鄉擬力捐募、分爲兩步、第一步先籌一百萬元、甬滬各半擔任、第二步再籌一百萬元、甬地旣屬爲難、滬方願多負其責、無論如何不願爲平糶而增加人民擔負、蓋民不聊生、始辦平糶以救濟、抽稅加費負擔仍在平民、而况影響所及、普遍後方全國、因此決議不表贊回、至甬方祇募三十躲萬、愚見所及、似可增加數量、尚非搜雜殆盡、蓋此番國難期內、發財者甚多、不妨從良心上源源輸將也、現在</p>
<p>滬上存米</p>
<p>所以漲價者、因有新到之米一二寓餘包、尚未向海關報進口、米行居奇抬高、是以可轉口之米喊到每包六十二三元、而本街米價祇有每包五十五元、且少受主、此實因滬甬輪船限制裝米可以直航進口、各輸船公司搶辦轉口米一萬餘包、不問何價因而抬高之故、不得已向香港購辦、其價比西貢每包便宜三四元、先辦二萬包　運來甬、急籌現款購港幣、原擬所有財政部核准三北平糶會名下運鈔一百萬元、如數裝滬、詎料謀福輪裝來平米項下、祇有五十萬元、餘歸別用不數、囑弟代墊、如有餘力亦無不可、但弟因墊三北平糶名下已達一百五十萬元、皆係私產抵借而來、實無力再行籌借、二則滬市套利有四分餘、滙劃貼現一百二三十元、</p>
<p>如此重利</p>
<p>尙有何人肯借、因甬滙浩大、米款急迫、弟恐尊處現無現鈔可裝、願將三北米款存甬中國銀行者、借與尊處五十萬元裝申、嗣接大烈兄來電云、有四十萬元巳抵還前裝米款、查各輸所裝之米並非救濟、實爲甬限各船有米可進、吾則停航、有此限制、各輪公司搶辦爲營業計、款雖須還、稍緩不妨、事後查聞謀　船有一千包尚未裝　、款先收到、如係實悄、更爲駭異、現在無可奈何之中、滬方湊墊五十餘萬元、併甬來五十萬元、先辦一萬八千包、不日裝格蘭船由港直放來甬、先行救濟、嗣後續辦、須備現款方可進行、而捐款一時未能齊集、亦祇有借墊一法矣、又旅滬同鄕諸公之意見擬先辦五萬包、的合六萬餘石、預備每包軋虧二十元、計一百萬元、第二步再辦五萬包再籌一百萬元之主張、前後虧款二百萬元、足敷救濟、至其藝價擬定每石三十元、即每元買米五斤、順以奉布、</p>

<h3>糧食　米商又在掀風作浪　造作種種無非搖惑人心　其慾逐偏思趁火打刧</h3>
<p>上海米商又在趁火打刼、利用浙東缺米之事實、搖動上海之人心、操縱上海之米價、居心毒辣、甚於蛇虺、而所散播之謠言、（一）爲洋米　批定米缺少、滬上存底不豐、只有七十餘萬包、此種出於米商口中之數字、隨意可說多說少、不能作數、關於米糧存底、租界當　不肯擔起實地調查之責、一任米商報告、殊爲失計、至洋米是否續定、旣非公開、何能知其底蘊、米商望其跌、儘可說定貨大宗可到、米商望其漲、亦可說一無定貨、一切皆從米商口中出、何可相信、（二）造作天旱不能挿秧之說此更可惡、入霉尚在端節後、芒種未屆、何以知霉雨不來、且霉雨即不至、影響小過在浙省地勢較高之區、若產米巨區、大抵港汶紛歧、耶使不雨、不過多費人力、何至不能種稻、故此拽　素、米商惟恐米價不高、操縱惟恐無口實、甩以搖動市塲人心、硬抬米　之狡計、租界當局對於糧食市塲、不應長此放任，由奸商危害民食也、加以浙省杭紹甬等地、米糧恐慌、日在採辦接濟、粵間之潮汕　門幫、及蘇嘉路一帶之南潯嘉湖等區、相繼搜進頓時去路陡廣，各色米　愈漲愈高也、</p>
<p>洋米昨日客化更　、杭紹內地各　納胃不衰、甬　亦有　辦、本街方面因國米供量不足、需　　濃、兼被業內外浮戶爭貿與貨方居奇扳俏、市　乃見節節騰漲、小絞米上午已自四十九元七八角漲至五十元〇五六角、下午則大至五十一元三角、二號西貢及火紋均昂至五十二元、一號新西貢亦大至五十三元、比之前市則上午已漲元許、下午續大五六角、小絞原包亦大至六十一元、暹邏二號六十一元尚乏售出、新定曾五十七元左右打電接洽、據傳已有若干定妥、然因船隻安全問題、米商與洋行均有觀望云、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、旣處於同等地位、傳聞塲外暗盤遂亦蠶動、都係實　去路、售價一致提升、常幫淸特粳做開五十六七元、粉粳五十四元、常崑粳　特自五十四元、次之五十二三元、靑泗特薄五十五六元、大巿五十三四元、次之五十一二元、南港早稻五十一二元、斛見五十元、</p>
<p>糯米到貨雖亦不多、然銷塲不若他貨之廣、致　僅隨粳尖帶高半元至近元、若金溧特元售四十六元、常丹白元四十四五元、次之四十二三元、江北白元則以往日售盤較廉、且身骨較硬、頗合內地去路、猶見暢銷、是以售價能提一元有奇、開四十二元半至四十二元、</p>
<h3>粉商又起把持</h3>
<p>昨粉市交易並不十分熱烈、市面頗形暗緊、蓋因邇日南北兩帮客銷漸露動機、內地浙甬等處、亦均感米荒、粉銷殊爲不弱、故廠方迭將客盤暗提、聞有十三元六角之高價、但非公開市面、至於二號粉本街批價、則爲維持性質、暫守十三元八角原盤、恐不日亦將提高、內地粉順風等牌亦昂至十三元八九角、良以連朝米價步挺、物價更有看高之象、查鋼粉今日有一百包、運往汕頭、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯續見緊縮</h3>
<p>外匯昨日巿况、滙豐掛牌、悉無更動、英美滙暗巿、續告軟化、此因外銀行需要激增、籌碼遂見短少、至投機商兩日來、並無大量扒進、但亦未見售出、晨初因滙兌忽然回長、開後乃告英平美鬆狀態、嗣即英行猛吸先令及美滙、聞係代平準委會所買、繼之美行跟扒、價愈緊縮，美滙達五元三七五、英金成交四辦士〇三一二五、時的十點半光景、外行進出互有、供求尚平、趨勢轉穩、收盤前微微回硬、結果英金四辦士〇四六八七五、美滙五元四三七五較上日英美各緊〇九三七五、期貨所緊不多、與現貨較爲軋龍、</p>
<p>外銀行進意殷切</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均跌一八七五、紐約銀價小半分、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬·法·等各滙俱平、美對英長三七五、對滬大五分、對滬大一分八七五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一四〇六二五、美滙五元五六二五較上日晚收英平美　〇三一二五、此因滙兌突然回升之故、開後英行進意殷切、價即微軟、計入外行現先令爲四辦土一二五、又向美行買現美滙價五元半、以至四三七五、聞以上頭寸乃係代平準基金委員會所購、滙豐掛牌揭曉、仍未更動、白銀平衡稅揭曉、减低白分之一·〇〇、此後大通亦來扒吸、時外行極少供意、而華行曾賣予大通現先令己緊達四辦士〇三一二五、現美滙亦軟至五元三七五、迨十一時後、雖有利麥加　等均進、而沙遜日行等咸來塞出、市面尚穩、六月份先令成交計美行入沙遜三辦士八六八七五、六月份美滙正金售予有利及麥加利為五元二八一二五、午收前交易略淸、祇投機商見價回賤、扒入華行六月份美元五元半、收盤結果英金四辦士〇四六八七五、美滙五元四三七五、六月份英金三辦士九六八七五、美滙五元二八一二五、較隔昨收市、現貨英美均縮〇九三七五、六月份央緊〇三一二五、美軟〇一五六二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港美鬆英不動</p>
<p>香港一日（週六）電、今晨滙巿開盤告平、英滙及申滙均無變動、美滙現貨鬆一八七五、爲二十元一二五、日滙現貨放長一圓、爲八十五元、十時十分申滙現貨升四元、爲三百六十六元、十一時三十分告平、申滙現貨升一元、爲三百六十七元、其餘概無榮辱、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英滙略見緊</p>
<p>天津一日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、英滙現貨緊〇三一二五、爲三便士六五穴二五、美滙現貨及申滙均站原盤、「聯鈔」暗盤賤一角、爲一百元〇二角五分、</p>
<h3>五月份滙劃存息　每千元爲七元半</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、訂定五月份同業匯劃存款息、爲每千元七元五角、（即合月息七厘半）、</p>
<h3>金價出六千元大關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、上漲頗勁、又復跳出六千元大關、堅站高價原因、餘需要增多、及大戶加碼外、乃外匯緩緩走軟、使人心威懷、多頭觀念、絕非爲目前國內外消息所影響、本日半天買賣情况尚稱熱烈、晨開價爲五千九百三十元、較上日反撳二十元、後聞錢兌業猛入、不久即升達五千九百八十元、時外匯亦已報緊、而繼有某金號斷續吐塞、其數甚夥、漲勢稍抑、曾回落至五千九百五十五元、良以匯市愈軟、證劵幫大撈、金號亦來復進、造成一大買風、最高衛出六千元大關、見六千〇七十元高價、惟午前外滙略告回硬、且加散戶曁銀號幫獲利供出、重降至六千〇十元、至收盤結果告六千〇二十五元、較隔昨晚收升七十五元、半天交易的二千數白兩、銀樓飾金掛高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲七十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩、）人心略疲、撳小二十元、銀樓帮出銀號十兩、爲五千九百三十元、嗣因錢兌業及證券幫等互相扒吸、立拉起五十元、銀號互做十兩、爲五千九百八十元、旋某金號力售二百餘兩、且某銀樓亦跟之拋塞，頓小二十五元、金號進銀號二十兩、及證券幫進銀樓幫三十兩、均爲五千九白五十五元、斯時某銀樓代本幫限價六千元買進一百數十兩、市勢堅穩、不久外滙步軟、買風擴大、金號證劵幫銀號等爭先猛扒、　散戶見景亦拖、一時爲狀堅俏萬分、未幾飛躍一百餘元、銀號進同業等九十兩、爲六千〇七十元、此後滙市回硬、買者漸漸轉少、且某錢兌業重來沾出、咖散戶亦獲利出籠、回落六千元、銀號對做三十兩、爲六千〇十元、午刻銀號幫復來搜買、再又提起十五元、銀號進金號二十兩、爲六千〇二十五元、作午收價、結果比上日軋漲七十五元、半天一百四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百十元、迨至十時半掛大十元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸六百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低二十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣續昂</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤仍在港幫搜羅下、繼續挺漲、英獎金鎊跟隨續漲、英美金票以平準會又向黑市塲傾扒外滙、故各方需要頗殷、美票曾高至十八元四角半、卒爲十八元二角八分、比昨仍漲二角三分、英金票亦漲一角半、香港票隨港滬滙兌趨漲、法郎票稍有需要、市價略漲、坎拿大票及斐律濱票均有需要、市價一致挺漲、日金票各方供給仍旺、晚市退爲一元一角三分、朝鮮票供求均勻、晚市仍爲九角六分、</p>
<h3>貼現回低五元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、復見回下、每千元起初貼進爲一百二十三元、貼出須一百二十八元、最低貼進一百二十元、午刻在一百二十二元左右、下午趨平、比上日回低五元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛二角五分云、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債新買戶　漸感興趣　外債又見疲落</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、繼續趨堅、但在午前、交易仍極淸淡、午後略有新　買進交易、銀根前途、咸以爲漸漸看鬆、故做多者雖在週六之下午、仍稍有購買興趣、消息依照沉悶、但國際變化、當不在遠、買賣雙方、均有等待前途演變之情况、而定方向、昨日午前交易不足十萬、午後因協大信昌五源等號、稍有需要、義泰鴻大益昌雖有供出、略感不足、故市復再趨堅、戊種再到五十元、市價結果、繼續做好五分至一角半、成交總數、共計的三十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華成烟公可股五十股、價爲四十三元正、</p>
<p>倫教三十一日（週五）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市又告疲落、上檔之英德續（英發）中法美金及　後（英發）各跌二鎊、前用種均爲四十三鎊、後一種價爲二十四　、英法備款（英發）跌一鎊、後爲四十四鎊、下檔之北寗路跌兩鎊、價爲五十六鎊、廣九路跌一鎊、價爲八鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫教卅一日（週五）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、尚告平定、祇古拉客林傍橡皮股疲落七便士半、爲十六先令三便士、其餘平平、</p>
<h3>上海復興公債　抽籤還本</h3>
<p>民國二十一年上海特別市災區復興七厘公偵、第千五次抽籤還本、已於五月三十一日舉行、計抽出二二及九三兩號、上項中籤曁第十五期良票、均定於六月十五日由本市滙豐銀行開付、以六年爲期、期滿作廢、</p>
<h3>紗花　滙兌緊縮　棉紗買風再起</h3>
<p>紗巿平穩、稍形上升、此因月終已過、經營者頭襯可寬舒一步、同時外滙改縮、致人心振作、所以市　有顯著回蘇之象、不過實際交易、未能十分　展也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日午後黃金昂漲、人氣看緊、故喊價殊高、然新買戶寥寥無幾，開價二十支雙馬爲一千三百十元、跌至一千二百八十五元、旋聞滙兌又縮、買風再起、做至一千三白三十元、收盤回小十元、查半日間成交統計一千五百四十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三十元、今日有紗六百零五件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　三三〇　福州　四〇</p>
<p>同行　一、一六〇　厦門　一〇</p>
<p>統計　一、五四〇</p>
<h3>廠商觀望　棉巿呆滯</h3>
<p>本棉交易仍屬不旺、但同業間偶有互相負賣、至於廠方、日廠絕無動辦情形、所以市面無甚進出、目前仍在僵持之中、茲將現棉成交情形列左</p>
<p>大中集　二四三·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇包</p>
<p>康江花　二〇四·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>杜力拉　二〇七·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初開盤、市况尚稱平穩、後即因受賣方之壓力、棉價下沉、後又因西部棉區預測氣候之良好、及一部份現貨商之賣出近期、故市況轉疲、結果收盤價格、近期跌二十磅音、遠期降十餘磅音、印度市况平靜、預測漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、殊爲靜寂、各方暫抱觀望態度、市况頗形呆滯、然市上現貨不多、故售價始於堅定異常、天津幫　意已漸趨濃、日內原棉將有轉機矣、茲將昨日棉巿以美滙五元半、將期貨折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　三〇二·九〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　二九四·〇〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　三二一·八〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三一二·〇〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　三二五·五〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三一四·五〇</p>
<h3>雜糧　新蠶豆小半元　日油廠進黃豆</h3>
<p>昨日閔行新靑蠶豆市面、因在市塲外交易、故不作正市論、聞數祗三十餘包、價爲十九元、比前盤跌半元、正市尚不至此數、黃豆去路除少數由本街辦去外、餘四分之三均爲日商榨油廠之胃口、蓋因豆餅去路活潑、行情邁步向高峯挺進、致市况有軋空之勢、故豆之銷路更見擴展、但供不應求、大局向上挺升、昨開蚌埠豆一車、價爲二十四元五角、滁州豆一車、價爲二十三元、安慶豆四百餘包價爲二十四元五角至二十四元、蕪湖豆二百餘包、價爲二十三元二角至二十三元、明光豆一車、價爲二十四元二角、及平湖花皮豆一百包、太倉杜豆四十餘包、崇　沙黃三百包、又江北靑豆七白餘包云、</p>
<h3>油餅　日統制新菜籽　豆油又漲三元　豆餅漲風仍熾</h3>
<p>豆油　市面近因內地新菜籽被日商統制收買、致豆油價比菜油為賤、故引起各方辦胃、一般操縱得機壟斷、行情頻見上升、昨市在良好之景遇下、又跳漲三元、計　交各油四百餘桶及三百餘簍、又生油今日有八十件、運往汕頭、</p>
<p>豆餅　漲風熾、除大有餘廠擯持不開其他日商經營之廠尚有拋售、計油等幫辦去浦東同姓廠姓記餅三千片、及訂六月成交三千片、內地訂去崑山厚生廠牌餅四千片、市價均詳市價欄、</p>
<h3>絲茶　無錫繭價混亂　繭行大都放盤濫收</h3>
<p>無錫城鄕繭行被「　中公司統制佔多數、其餘滬錫絲廠及本縣小型絲廠、亦多開行收繭、因本屆繭行限制、無往昔之　、僅有一二具蔽灶、即可　帖開行、掛秤收貨、所以前日各路繭行開秤後、繭價極度混亂、絲繭公會限價、每擔二百五十元、（昨誤三百五十元）、而各行爲競買計、開秤後有超過限價五成以上者、此種混亂狀態、一方被競買抬高、更有白拉代賣牢利、正當繭商、尚抱觀望態度、收價大致以三百元爲大關、困育戶成本大小肯賤售、繭商方面、對於絲市滙水、亦須合算、爲歐戰絲銷阻滯、絲繭前途、殊見黯淡、如每擔超過三百元、恐有虧折也、（知）</p>
<p>又茶葉今日有二十件、運往香港、並有絲經五包、運往邏　、另有一包、運往西貢、</p>
<h3>疋頭　囤戶已具顴心　布巿漸入正軌</h3>
<p>國布　布市平穩、蓋以布價照最高價計算、已跌去三分之一左右、客幫採辦已大爲合算、惟以實銷尚在淸閒時期、且業內外過去一味囤積者、適此决嚴重損失、咸其戒心、故市面漲跌不大、漸入正軌、昨市各布售價、盤旋上落、的在二角半五角之間、浙路需要較佳、溫州幫續辦細布·斜紋·粗布·色布一百數十件、甬幫辦近百件、粵幫辦色布等貨百餘件、本街門市及內地批發生意稍有轉機、成交坯布色布粗布等貨二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　交易雖淸、市盤堅升十二磅龍頭細布晨開每疋四十元〇五角、四君子嗶嘰每碼一元〇八分半、後市行盤續好、龍頭細布喊價四十一元五角、嗶嘰一元一角左右、但成交不多、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭二百二十件運香港、一百零五件運土樂、四十五件運暹邏、</p>
<h3>一月來　呢絨行巿回顧</h3>
<p>呢絨市價、自上月二日外滙劇變後、漲風之烈爲歷年來所未有、邇來滙票雖已轉鬆、而　依然堅挺如故、此蓋歐戰關係、定到困難故耳、茲將匝月來呢絨市價、詳細查刊於後、</p>
<h3>糖巿　車白升二元</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙見縮、續趨上展、公會劃盤現貨一四粗白外棧貨、上午爲七十二元至七十一元半、復至七十一元八九角、下午稍鬆、爲七十一元八角至五角、升七用、轉口貨初升一元、爲五十八元半、後爲五十八元至五十七元九角、及八角、下午爲五十八元至五十七元半，無上落、太古車白B嘜由八十二元半升至八十三元、比前漲二元、H嘜車赤五十九元、升一元、荷赤仍六十一元、國糖有興化幫開出興化靑高貨六十包、　為六十五元、比前小二三元、餘乏成交、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘一小再小</h3>
<p>本廠元釘近來交易甚呆、外埠客商旣稀採辦、本街銷路亦少動靜、致市况岑寂、人心失秀、目查最近廠家方面之出產品、未見減小、故巿貨充沛、大有供過於求之感、所以標準行盤、一小再小、聞昨市喊價每桶倍司僅七十元、目暗中六十八九元亦有塞出、</p>
<h3>南北貨　廉元內報漲</h3>
<p>桂圓肉近以厦門同安等處均乏續到、巿存告缺、價乃轉緊、昨聞香港幫號家開出廉州桂圓肉一批、價達一百七十六元、行盤因亦隨緊、惟陳貨較平云、</p>

<h3>西綫大戰第一期</h3>
<p>去年八月以來，希　勒已經幾决修正他的基本戰略。他第一步計劃羅然是要再來一個墓尼克，不戰而亡波關。這個計劃嗣因波蘭決計作戰而成泡影。他的第二步計劃在於威脅英法放棄保障波蘭的政策，致使侵略波蘭一舉　爲局部戰爭。德蘇協定的成立作用就在於此。這種城脅沒有奏效。</p>
<p>他的第三步計劃在於一鼓而攻克波蘭，然後與英法議和。這個計劃適足使英法獲得充分動員的時間。　端旣啟，英法與德即無輕易媾和的餘地，否則，希特勒兵力未損，英法　爾復員，乃就無異軍事上的自殺了。</p>
<p>希特勒第四步計劃在以消耗極小的方法，對英作戰，就是利用潛水艇，磁石水雷，少數飛機，打擊英國的　　。一面努力充實經濟的後方，待機出擊，一面靜待民治國的衰落，厭戰，消磨戰　力，即使不足以强制英法停戰，亦足使之不耐煩，挺而走險。</p>
<p>至於英法的基本戰略，則在加緊封鎖，强迫希特勒，在窒息而死或主力出戰　者之問，擇一而行。這種戰略有兩大因索。第一，對鎖無諭如何嚴密，必須强迫德國大量消耗它積存的原料，使之補充不及，纔能削弱其兵力。這須加聚作戰，加速消耗率，纔能收最大的效果。因之，英法方面，只要避免一敗塗地，尤宜不顧局部的得失，强迫德國作大規模的戰爭，直到它　濟的弱點，成爲勝敗的關鍵，那時，封鎖纔成爲決勝的武器。</p>
<p>第二，希特勒所能使全歐洲成爲恐怖世界，在於他的實力·英法必須以强大的勇氣　大的犧牲，冒險與這種　力一戰，纔能號召歐洲各國，擺脫其恐懼心理，一致起而打倒希特勒。英法的與國到處皆是。但　法必須償付極大的代價，纔能取得他們的援助。</p>
<p>希特勒已在西綫實行總攻，不到二十天工夫即已攻到英倫海峽。這與上次歐戰第一期即所謂「向海賽跑」情形相彷彿。他所用的戰術即所謂閃電戰術Blitzkrleg先以大批飛機低飛炸毀敵軍陣地，以代替上次歐戰時所用的排砲。旋即以大隊重戰車，掩護大隊輕戰車，集中一點，猛烈進撲。有時且以降落傘部隊同時在敵後降落，以機關槍掃射守軍。</p>
<p>重戰車隊駛行較慢，消耗汽油較多，首决衝鋒之後，勢須落後，其時輕戰車隊，即超前掩護，儘力衝進，從事價察工作，若遇有重大阻力，即須等待重戰車隊上前衝擊。輕戰車隊之後，即繼以摩托化部隊，殿以步兵，用以佔領陣地。</p>
<p>戰車隊首次衝鋒時，常與大隊空軍密切聯絡，此後印不甚密切，但是戰車　若被戰車防禦陣地所遏阻，則戰車隊即以無錢　報告轟炸機隊飛來助戰。所用戰車共有一千二白輛之多，其攻勢自然銳不可富，聯軍作戰雖勇，也無法挽回頹勢。</p>
<p>或者說希　勒這决總攻，並非出於願意，乃因國內原料消耗漸多，難於過冬，同時父懼英法實力日見雄厚，爲時勢所迫，乃作孤注之一擲。但以現階段的戰果而論，英法雖可說曾在軍略上取獲優勢，但希特勒已在戰術上取獲勝利了。</p>
<p>歐戰地名考</p>
<p>西綫戰事告緊以來，各路軍隊進退，迅速異常，一般　者，多以各通訊社所譯地名，參差不齊爲苦，本刊茲乃隨時就歐洲大小戰塲，作地名考，絡續發表，其內容以與時事有關者爲主，他如人口，物產，風俗之屬地理學者，則付缺加，所用譯名，係以商務印書館出版綜合英漢大辭典爲依據，取其便利而已，（實則各通訊社苟能不彈煩勞，仿此爲之，則地名譯名，自可不約而同）編者附誌。</p>
<p>法　德斯Flanders　係自法國卡雷港Calais，至比國斯刻爾特河Schelde，及立士河Lys流域，一帶沿海區域，海岸綫長四十餘英里，沿岸有丹刻克Dunkirk，俄斯坦德Ostend最布魯革Zeebroge等港，居民大多數係弗萊芒族，在上次默戰末期，即一九一八年九月二十八日，英法比三國聯軍，（比軍爲左翼，法軍担任中路，英軍爲右翼）由比利士國王亞爾培一世指揮，採取攻勢，至十月一日，攻入德軍陣地八英里，至十月十七日，最後一隊德軍退出俄斯坦德港，是爲「法蘭德斯之戰」。</p>
<p>斯刻頗特河Schelde即法國人所稱厄斯科河Escant，起源於法國，經比利時荷蘭流入北海，爲法蘭穗斯區邊界綫，喀姆布來Carnbrai筏崙西恩Valenolennes都兩內Tournai奧丹那得Oudenarde岡特Ghent安特衛普Antwerp均爲沿岸　要城市，河長二百五十英里。</p>
<p>亞多亞Artois係法國北部阿拉斯城Arras四週區域，地圖上不易尋出，法國革命前曾劃成一省，現僅爲一般人叫愼之空洞地名，一九一五年五六月間，聯軍爲牽制德軍，使不得分兵開赴東綫抵禦俄軍攻英軍頗有進展，但死傷軍官二萬二千九百二十三人，士兵四十七萬六千五百五十三人之多，第二次「索謨之戰」乃係一九一八年三月二十一日開始，即爲德軍最後總攻之第一幕，當時西綫德軍共有一百五十萬人，大砲一萬六千門，來勢甚猛，直至八月八日英軍以坦克車四百五十輛，掩護主力，大敗德軍，是役德軍被俘者二萬一千人，英軍損失僅二萬人，</p>
<p>色當Sedan係法國一城，位於謬司河Meuse右岸，在巴黎東北一百六十四英里，上决歐戰期內，爲德軍所佔領，直至停戰前始為美法兩國軍隊所克復，該城係於一八七〇年普法之戰時出名，是年九月一日拂曉德軍參謀長大毛奇下令總攻，法王拿破崙三世不敵，乃率軍十萬四千人投降，德軍死傷九千人，是爲「色當之戰」。</p>
<p>列日Liege係比國名城，橫跨謬司河，高山環抱，地努雄壯，使於該國京城東南五十五英里，距德國邊境十英里左勢起見，曾自阿拉斯進攻德軍，　為得手，是為「　多亞之戰，」</p>

<p>盧芳Louvain係比國文化城，位於蒂爾河Dyle距京城東北東十九英里，有名之盧芳大學，係於一四一六年開辦，十六世紀，已有學生六千名，一九一四年，德軍侵人，全城被焚，大學圖書館亦付之一炬，損失浩大，一九二一年建造新圖害館，由美國及其他各國人民捐贈書籍，一九二八年落成，現有圖書六十餘萬冊，其中英國曼哲斯特城的翰萊倫治圖書館捐贈五萬冊。</p>
<h3>美國參戰問題的檢討</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>一九三九年和一九一四年的情形可大不相同了。我們現已　得二十五年的經騐，知道了現代戰爭的恐怖。可是這種經騐也使我們回憶到聖密希　和亞岡兩大戰役和巴黎凱旋門下的勝利行軍。這種回憶使我們的情感，政策，和國家的利益與　法相聯結，較之一九一四年更密切得多。我們也已明瞭一九一四年時所不知道的世界演變，更明白美國感受歐洲任何大戰的影響，會到何種程度。</p>
<p>去年歐戰爆發的時候，美國人所得歐洲的消息，也許較他人更靈通。我們既已看到上决世界大戰，中日戰爭，阿比西尼亞和西班牙戰爭，對於德國此次進攻荷比等國野蠻行動所受刺激，已不像上次大戰時德國進攻比國那樣劇烈了。我們對於這决戰爭的基本態度，並非在恐怖和戰時宜傳的震驚之下，忽忙決定的。我們深知這决戰爭必在多方面與我們有直接關係，而我國或者終將成爲交戰國。</p>
<p>今日美國人的態度，當然還含着與上决相同的意識，即央法聯軍是在替我們作戰，或將產生一種更强大的壓力，使美國出而干涉，以防英法的敗衂。然而美國現在的態度，更有自知力，更尚現實，對於干涉的必要性，自然要作更冷靜的和更現　的打算。美國人在追德方面所感覺的憤懣，顯較上次大戰爲低，對於德國行動，事實上將使美國受到怎樣的影響，亦有更切實的考量。假便我們被動的出而援助英法，我們將更明白地知道自己的作爲當如何。羅斯福總統並未像威爾遜總統那樣的囑咐全國在「思想上中立」。我國政治家和民衆這决不致冉在事實上已有偏袒，而自以爲行動完全公正不偏的了。</p>
<p>我們對於現代戰爭的猛烈和恐怖性，這决不致估計過低了。雅典尼亞號被魚雷轟沉所引起美國人的憤懣，和上次大戰時魯西達尼亞號被擎沉時所引起的怒潮相較，祇是微弱的波動而已。這無非因爲我們已是在戰爭本身的浩刧中見到這些悲劇，且極明瞭阻止這種悲劇必將耗費更大的代價。</p>
<p>這次戰爭雖已引起了許多與上决戰爭時同樣的問題，但其背景有別，反響也不同。醫如英國此次截斷我國對穗貿易，我們也已默認，但道貿易本身對於我國的重要性，已較一九一四年時大　减少了。</p>
<p>即使美屈軍事工業因戰爭而發達，但也不致使美國參戰。商人也有了經騐，知道參　　須失去中立國的大利所在，而常受戰時重稅和嚴格統制了。因之美國如果參戰，決非出於工業界或金融界的操縱，是可斷言的，這無非因爲工業界和金融界對於參與大戰必使社會和經濟失常一節，較其他任何事業，更加害怕。</p>
<p>總之，美國如果被迫參戰，一定有更重大的原因使之不得不然。不過出兵的機金必較一九一四年爲少。特問題的癥結不在美國是否參戰，而在何種條件下參戰。美國避不捲入　渦的預防辦法與海空軍實力巳甚充足。所無準備的，在沒有規定。何種利益與美國生存攸關，以及美國必須參戰的目標何在而己。</p>
<p>無論勝敗屬誰，某種新的國際制度必須在瘡痍滿目中樹立起來。然而何種制　爲美國所歡迎。我們願　盡力到什麼程度，促其實現呢。</p>
<p>這些才是眞正的問題。現在所將決定的，也許不是美國如何　身事外，而是美國當採　何種賢明行動，以促成新局面，　免蹈上决參戰的覆轍。（　譯美國Life羅誌）</p>
<h3>名飛行家　林白上校之方</h3>
<p>歐洲的情形　響美國之處甚大，困爲我們對於她的關係這　關係，並不是對於交戰的一方，而是對於雙方的。我們對於交戰雙方的福利，在物質和精神方面，都是休戚相關。　精神方面說，我們所關切的在保存歐洲文明：從物　方面說，我們須要保全歐沸的實力。無論從那一方面設，我們所須要的是　個團　的而不是一個分　的民族家　。</p>
<p>這决的歐　曠日持久，無論美國或西洋文明均無益處，　爭愈持久，我們的民族家庭愈削弱，愈足以招致外來的禍患。美國的政策應當常是反均父母之邦的自　殘殺，而當　我們的力量，以身作則，促進和平。</p>
<p>但是我們不可自欺欺人，以爲我們可以用參戰或保障條的的方法促進歐洲各國的和平。假使要奠定持久的和平，就應富避免而不當重蹈凡爾賽和約的覆轍。應當使有作戰能力者放棄作戰野心。這事體大，沒有方式可循，祇有利用智慧，沒有保障，祇有滿意。</p>
<p>上次歐戰巳經證明美國派遣艦隊赴歐參戰的錯誤，我們所促成的勝利，匪特沒有樹立公道正義，自相殘殺的戰審反而變本加厲。我們對於無意和平的强大民族，不能以武力强制和平。凡讀過英德法三國歷史的人，都知道征　的意念，一有機會，常是超過和平的追求。</p>
<p>我們的政策應當在可能的範圍之內　弭歐洲的戰爭，吾則應當袖手旁觀，聽任歡洲各國瓦族自尋歸宿。我們作壁上觀，庶幾還有一個富强的西方國家，碩果僅存的保持着文化的火炬，在歐洲殘局中領路。西洋文明若不與羅馬文明，希臘文明，埃及文明，巴比侖文明，同歸於盡，則文化的火炬應當在我們之間保持着。（節譯Atlantle　Monthly）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統之言</h3>
<p>南北美洲可以閉關自守一稱思想，旣屬無益，抑且不可能。我國的國防政策若以這種思想爲根據，適足以招致將來的攻擊。兩星期以來的種種事變，巳把孤立主義派許多幻想打銷了。他們以爲美國處境遼遠，可以孤立自保的一種幻想也消滅了。我們現已愈加現實化，但亦不必輕視自身的實力。</p>
<p>時至此際，全世界，包括美洲半球在內，正受着大破壞的威脅，南北美洲決當迅速地充實軍備，應付一切。我們所要保護的，所要創造的生活方式，不僅是爲若美洲，而且是爲着全人類。我們的責任重大，任務高尚。</p>
<p>我日夜爲這瘋在的世界祈禱和平。凡我國人一定在同樣的祈禱。在一種共同愛護人類的虔誠中，我們祈禱上帝治療人類的損傷，安撫人類的心胸。</p>

<h3>怎樣紀念「六三節」？</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>小朋友們，明天（六月三日）又是一年一度的「六三」紀念節了！</p>
<p>六月三日那天，是兩個重要紀念節，一是淸代林則徐焚燬英商鴉片的紀念，一是上海商界罷市的紀念，現在分述如决，小朋友其誌念勿忘！</p>
<p>（一）道光十九年，（西曆一八三九年）派林則徐任兩廣總督，查辦海口禁烟事件，林氏對於禁政，雷厲風行，在虎門焚燬英商販運入口之鴉片，達兩萬餘箱，時民元前七三年，（西曆一八三九年）六月三日也。國民政府成立後，即以這天爲禁烟紀念節」，稱爲「六三紀念」。</p>
<p>（二）民國八年（西曆一九一九年）五月，東鄰迫我承認二十一條的，北平方面學生，於是有五四運動，學生被捕的甚多，上海商界於六月三日，全體罷市，內地亦紛紛起而響應！北政府卒罷免曹（汝霖）章（宗祥）陸（宗輿）三人，並釋放學生，其事始寢，此爲吾國商界參加政治運動的第一次，因亦稱「六三紀念」。</p>
<p>小朋友們，林則徐氏的剛毅，果斷，不屈，不撓！其精神和政績，足與日月爭光！林氏的被謫伊外，也可見消廷時代報政者的昏　糊發了。</p>
<p>因亡國的二十一條，非但喚起了學生的奮鬥精神，並且警醒了孜孜爲利不免有國的　　中人，而實現了目前爭取民族解放戰鬥的共司大團結，豈無故哉？不過孤島上藉國難而作投機貿　壓迫平民生活的一般奸商，還沒有憬然領悟的象徵，殊可太息！希望小朋友們見到爸爸媽媽或哥哥妹妹（已出嫁的）等有上述的行爲的，切實泣諫，告訴他們以「六三紀念」的意義，這是每僩小朋友應盡的責任阿！</p>
<h3>紀念林則徐先生</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>小朋友，明天是葉烟紀念日，讓我來講一隻故事給你們聽聽罷。</p>
<p>淸朝道光年間，林公則徐任湖廣總督，非常痛恨鴉片，便奏請淸政府嚴禁，淸政府尤他的奏報，就派他做欽差大臣，到廣東去查，等他到了廣州，一面嚴拿販賣鴉片的奸商，一面令英商把私藏的鴉片完全交出，英商不許，林公便派兵包圍英國商船，並斷絕它們的糧食，英商沒法，只得把二萬二百八十三箱鴉片交出來，他把這許多鴉片，運到虎門海岸，完全燒燬。</p>
<p>英政府後來派了許多兵艦，先向廣東進攻，因林公防備嚴密，不能攻下，就轉攻沿海各處，後又北攻天津，再奪了鎭江，直逼南京，滿淸政府非但不把這幾處駐守的官吏治罪，反說林則徐的不是，不該輕起兵端，於是把林則徐削職治罪，一面派人和英軍議和，訂立了南京條約，這是道光二十二年的事情。</p>
<p>自從這决禁烟失敗後，國外的鴉片便可堂堂皇皇的運到中國來流毒無窮了，民國以來，蔣委員長他是主張厲行禁烟的，所以規定六月三日爲禁烟紀念日，全國人民警惕的反省啊。</p>
<h3>博物院將舉行　學校兒童收藏物品競賽會</h3>
<p>— 阿金</p>
<p>本市博物院路二十號，亞洲文會與尚賢堂聯合主辦的上海博物院，因欲推進敎育上效用，並提倡學校兒童採集與收藏之興趣，及鼓舞中小學生利用暑期休假，多與自然界接觸起見：擬於本年秋季舉辦學校兒童收藏物品競賽展覽會的消息，己見上月卅日本報敎育消息欄。惟所記尚嫌未詳，茲特補誌於下，以告本刊讀者。</p>
<p>該會此次舉辦目的，純爲促使兒童感到採集興趣，亦爲增進智識之要徑；並使不致虛擲假期，用以探討進修。確定日期的在本年暑期後九月間；關於一切詳細辦法，現在尚未決定，容後冉告。唯自即日起，不論自然標本，及愛好物品如錢幣，捲烟圖片，郵票，玩具等，凡爲學校兒童平日或日後所採集及收藏者；已可向該院事務科發記，用個人名義亦可，如用學校名義集團參加，則尤爲歡迎。</p>
<h3>節約日光運動</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們大概都知道：節的日光運動巳在工部局贊同之下，從昨天（六月一日）起開始實行了。什麼是節的日光運動呢？我們探求它的意義，當可知道：就是在夏季晝長夜短的四個月（六月一日至九月三十一日）中，把鎭點撥快一個小時；如此一來，上半天可以早起，下半天又可以得到意外的一小時去恢復半天來的疲勞或弄些相當的消遺。</p>
<p>總括各方面的結果，推行節的日光運動，是利多弊少，所以，我們每一個人都應該去提倡力行的。</p>
<p>你今天是在什麼時候起身的？筆者知道有許多小朋友，他們每天總得老晚起身，有時候非得待媽媽喚醒，他們是永遠不會自己起來的。到了如今，你們都不該這樣了，節的日光運動的第一個要點，就是叫我們大家早起，早起早眠乃是强身的秘訣啊。</p>
<p>其决，在這裏我們應該特別注意的，就是在午後多出的一個小時中，我們切不可去把用在遊玩嬸戲之中，趁這個機會，我們小妨多看幾本書，多作幾件有意義的課外活動，我們大家必須知道：這一個鐘點，決不是叫我們早些回家與爸去看戲，或是到馬路上去「騎脚踏車」，「踏跑冰鞋」，「造房子」的！</p>
<p>最後，我謹以十二萬分的至誠，希望諸位小朋友都能　從「節約日光運動」中得到些身心上學問上的進步，那才不負節約的初旨了。</p>
<h3>時疫</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>「那病原菌是怎麼樣的？為什麽我從沒有看見過？」</p>
<p>「你說你從來沒有看見，遵也不能怪你，因爲病原菌是一種很微細的細菌，害得我們的肉眼不能瞧見，而在顯微鏡下才能看見。細苗的範圍很大種類很多，病原菌便是細菌的一種，可是病原菌的種類也是多得可以同，凡是一種疾病，都有一種病菌。不過細菌的形狀，不外球形，桿狀和螺旋紋三種，各種細菌的形狀雖各有不同，而總是大同小異。細菌的繁殖眞是迅速，每一個細菌在每半小時中分裂一决，試想在一天二十四小時後，它們的分裂數確可驚人，換句話說，它們無時無刻在等待侵入人體的機會，就是不論何時，我們有生病的可能。它們繁殖雖是這樣快，要是一見日光便死了，故它們的死亡率也很大。細菌不都是有害的，就是發酵時的酵母細菌却對於我們有莫大的利益，而病原菌確是我們不忘的仇敵。」</p>
<p>「那麼病原菌一侵入人體中，都要生病的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，這要依人體的强弱而定，因爲病菌侵入我們身體中，血液中的白血球似乎受着命令般，向病菌宣戰，於是發生大戰，如果我們身體强健的話，那白血球便很勇敢，扺毒力量也很大，當然是戰無不勝，攻無不克的，把病菌二殲滅。要是身體不强的話，那白血球復戰心渙散，垂頭喪氣，只得向病菌，乞憐求和，於是病菌在身體中，肆無忌憚的把身體的組織一一破壞，因此我們便去延請醫生來診治，打針吃藥，就是把一支生力軍加人更把白血球與奮起來，終於把可惡的病菌　滅，又把身體的組織建設　來，也就是身體恢了健康。」</p>
<h3>兩個農夫和雲　—弗林寓言—</h3>
<p>— 趙易林</p>
<p>有兩固農夫，一同走路。甲帶着可憐的音調對乙說：他相信那邊的黑雲，就是不幸的預兆。威廉愉快的答道：「怎麼呢」？約翰回答道：「我敢打賭，就要下冰雹了。麥要被打壞，要被打得一根麥穗也不剩，接着就是荒年。」威廉和善的說道：一你這個人，眞是在那裏做夢呵！我在鉛色的雲上，看不見別的，不過是裏面藏着許多雨罷了。這雨不但不會損害，反而可以使得我們豐收。今年一定會是一個熟年，所以，讓我們來歡樂吧。喝一杯麥酒，來感祝這雨吧。」的翰發怒道：「你，簡直是胡說」！威廉也還他一句「你，眞是瞎了眼！」像這樣爭吵開始，越吵越利害，幾乎動手相打。忽見來了一陣迅速的風，把雲吹散。於是，兩個人都不再爭執了！</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（五）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>我自從第一次上過了跳舞課後，對於那小跳跳步子，練習得很動。要是攝影塲中沒有工作時，一天到晚，便老是在屋子裏園子裏跳來跳去，傑克和生南，每天總要上學校去讀齊的，我却不停的打擾　們，硬要他們看我的跳舞。他們恨極了，向我呼叱道：「滾開去，滾開去！秀蘭，你不要老是纏繞不淸。」那時我也並不怨恨他們，因爲這種跳舞的步子，實在沒有什麼好看，不過一上一下的跳着，再把脚尖略略搖動罷了。</p>
<p>如今我那兩位哥哥，却因我而自豪了。前天傑克和兩位同學從史丹福大學回來，帶他們倆上樓，直到我的玩偶室中來瞧我。他很得慧的同兩位同學放聲說道：「坐在那邊地板上的，就是我的小妹妹秀蘭。」當下他要證明我確是他的妹妹，便低下頭來吻了我一下。可是他那兩位同學，是決不能如此的。至於生南，我也曾聽得過他在新墨西哥的陸軍學院中向同學們誇口，把我道小妹妹讚美得什麼似的。當初是當初，現在是現在；當初他們倆確是瞧不上我的跳舞的。</p>
<p>可是，我上了第五次第六次的跳舞課後，我那一雙脚，就熟練多了。我的步子，巳跳得很好，並且巳能跳那脚步的軟鞋踢躂舞。我在家裏練習時，倘若不開無綫電機，就在嘴上低低的哼着曲兒。我　常哼着的，就是那支蘇黃河曲，不久我已唱得很好了。有時媽媽給我彈鋼琴，只用兩個手指兒捺着音鍵，我就和着唱了起來。即使到了最近期間，我每逢在主演的影片中需要歌唱時，事前也總是這樣練習的。主持福克斯攝影塲的希漢先生，很鼓勵我正式學習鋼琴，因此送了我一架小鋼琴，至今放在攝影塲上的那座平屋中，我不時去彈奏一下的。</p>
<h3>自制</h3>
<p>靑年沒有或少有經騐做背景，不配做道德上的最後權威。道德標準，不能因爲他們反對，就認爲錯。他們有時把許多問題提出來問牧師，並且做成種種答案，那知他們的答案，有憂史上早巳見過多次。四如他們的「自表主義，」在數千年前，希臘國不早有人說過，　我們吃喝快樂吧，因爲明天我們許死去」話雖兩樣，意義却同。自然，所謂道德標準，不是要我們無問題的接受，不能因爲年數多就一定是好。不過，有些是從經騐上得來，　是不錯。十條誡命，是永遠的眞理，不諭過多少年代，也不能改變這是非標準。犯　命的人，馬上受禍，如響斯應。否測，世界豈不要變成瘋人院，人事何能維特？必須世人　守道德，然後文化纔克進步。行爲的基本律法，是永遠的，通行無阻的，不葡也不新。忽視或遠犯的人，決難免危險。靑年說，「　自已去，」但是我們要問，你自己值得自表　？」自由決非說不要主宰。自由生活，乃是在一種偉大旨趣和自信的主宰之下生活。船有主，能限期到埠，否則，　蕩無期，危險孰甚。人所以達到成功目標，都是有主宰的。保羅說，「凡較力爭勝的，諸事皆有節制。」無節制的生活，是犯法的，能使個人和國家敗亡。我相信有價價的「自表主義，」是從最嚴格的自制得來。凡人要得着　　生命，須從自制和訓練方面去找。遵守行爲律法，實行嚴格自制，這是得着完美有權能之人生的秘訣。（完）</p>

<p>金像獎明星</p>
<h3>崇拜的藝人</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>凡是獲得金像獎的明星，是證明他（她）的演技已經無人再可以相與比擬，照理，是値得在衆人面前傲視的了，可是，實際的情形是怎樣呢？他（她）們都有自己目光中所崇拜的明星。</p>
<p>獲一九三三年男明星金像獎的却爾斯勞頓，他生平所最崇拜的明星就是銀幕上著名的笑匠却利，卓別林。在一决好萊塢宴會上，他吿訴一個英國某雜誌的女記者說：『很使我奇怪像卓別林這種演員，爲什麼就從未獲過金像獎。如果有人叫我選三張自有電影史以來最好的影片，那麽我將全選他所主演的傑作呢！』</p>
<p>在一九三六年獲獎的保羅茂尼，平日他說：『凡是有一點特長的明星，我是一律加以敬意的』自在上年他看了「萬世師表」後勞勃杜奈就成了他心目中所最最崇拜的明星。相反的，就因該片而在上年度獲獎的勞勃杜奈，據聞他所崇拜的明星，正就是保羅茂尼呢！</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲已二次獲得金　獎了，她沒有天賦的美貌，她的能够爲影迷們擁戴，所恃的全是她的演技，所以一個受她崇拜的明星，可以說一句是不容易的呢。各位知道是誰？他就是埃洛爾茀林。『叫他主演硬性的影片，他就能拿起弓來，跨上馬背，飛馳於野谷深山之間，叫他中演軟性的呢，他父能處處體貼，令人感快。』這幾句話就是蓓蒂黛維絲爲他所下的評語呀！</p>
<p>維多麥克勞倫，他是在一九三五年因爲主演　革命叛徒一片而獲獎的。就因爲他所主演的片子，終是一貫粗鹵的作風，所以他所崇拜的明星，是逃不了有英雄氣味的。已故的范朋克就是他所最崇拜的。據聞，在范朋克逝世的惡耗初傳人他的耳朶的時候，素不流淚的他亦情不自禁的流了幾滴呢</p>

<p>第一章　「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>這天早晨，是一毬襯衫裹面還缺不了一件衛生衫的氣候。天空中已經放晴。一片片或深或淺的白雲，運行很速，襯著最美麗的蔚藍的背景，幻出種種奇獸怪巖的景狀，那景狀隨著它的運行而變化不定。我們門外人行道上的法國格桐上的新葉，因著上夜裏的雨水，洗滌得越發肥潤，靑翠欲滴，如果有方法可以估量的話，這一夜的滋長的速度，一定比往日加增若干。</p>
<p>我一個人正在樓下辦公室中進簡單的早餐—稀飯。霍桑的淸晨時的戶外運動還沒有完畢，這是他數十年如一日的老習慣，也是我所贊同而始終沒有勇氣實行的一種好習慣。忽而一陣淸脆的門鈴，衝破了淸晨的靜寂，不禁使我停住了筷。這不是霍桑回來，他用不著捺門鈴。但訪問的來客又怎麼曾這樣早？接著施桂的脚聲已開了鬥回進來了。　他向我報吿說：「包先生，一位小姐。」他又放低了些聲音補充—「一位挺漂亮的小姐！——」</p>
<p>施桂—霍桑的老僕，也是我們的老僕—已上了些年紀，可是他對於美的欣賞力，分明還沒有喪失或减退。他這一句報吿倒使我有些發窘。因爲我這時還沒有穿好衣服，祇披著一件藍條白地的棉織品的梳洗袍，足上也赤裸著，趿著一雙棕色牛皮的拖鞋。這樣子似乎不便見客，尤其是女客。可是事實上絕對不容許我猶豫，那女客已高跟鞋得得地走進這權充餐室的霍桑的辦公室來。—（二）</p>

        <h1>1940.06.02</h1>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Everyone hopes to have a set of crystal-clear, healthy, and white teeth. Unfortunately, once attacked by cavity-causing bacteria, the suffering that follows is as deep as the sea. This is because these bacteria are exceptionally aggressive. They destroy a strong tooth as if a group of barbarians were invading a city with swords and spears!</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>When we feel tooth pain or inflammation inside the tooth, it means these dreadful bacteria are already at work. At this point, even if you try to use other medications, it is to no avail. The bacteria have already penetrated deep into the tooth, and the enamel is severely damaged. From then on, you will be constantly worried, not only suffering mentally but also severely impacting your physical health!</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Since teeth are so crucial to our health, we should always take good care of them. However, ordinary toothpaste can only whiten teeth and may lack antibacterial power or damage the enamel. It cannot fully shoulder the responsibility of protecting teeth, leading to rampant cavities and patients suffering in agony. Therefore, we must use toothpaste with fine quality and strong antibacterial power to prevent corrosion and maintain healthy teeth.</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Meeshulin Toothpaste is a remarkable product of Baitan Incense Soap Factory in 1940. It is made with precious and novel ingredients using scientific methods. It not only cleans teeth with a pleasant fragrance but also has an exceptionally strong antibacterial power. Its effectiveness is comparable to a modern iron army equipped with supreme weapons.</p>

<h3>Allied Rearguard Fights Bravely; Evacuation Largely Completed; After Two Days of Fierce Fighting, the French Recapture Abbeville; German Counterattack on the Lower Somme Fails</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable non-official sources, the Allied evacuation from the front can now be considered largely completed. Only one division remains on the front lines. Prior to this information, well-informed sources had already reported that 75% of the British Expeditionary Force and the French and Belgian armies had escaped danger. (1st, Combined Industry Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters announced in its war bulletin this morning, "The British and French armies, navies, and air forces continue to fight to the death in the Dunkirk area, resisting enemy attacks and covering the evacuation of Allied troops through the port. Furthermore, the enemy's large-scale counterattacks in the Somme River area have been repelled." (1st, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: The French Public Gazette reported that the British and French forces in Dunkirk are still fully united, fighting fiercely to resist the German advance and ensure the safe evacuation of the remaining troops. The enemy's counterattack in the Somme region was repelled, demonstrating their particular concern about the French crossing the Somme River. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: Military figures here recently stated that the Allied forces in the front area are continuing to retreat towards the port of Dunkirk, with the situation proceeding very smoothly. Part of General Prioux's troops have already withdrawn to Dunkirk to participate in the defense, while another part is still fighting the Germans en route, but their position is becoming increasingly difficult. As the Germans are unable to attack Dunkirk from the sea, they can only bomb with planes, lay mines on the sea surface, and launch torpedoes with torpedo boats. However, the supply of Allied ammunition and food has not been blocked, and unnecessary troops can still evacuate by ship as usual without being hindered, with minimal losses. As for the fighting on the lower Somme River, our forces have recaptured a bridgehead on the north bank. The enemy launched two counterattacks yesterday, one with infantry only and the other with aircraft and tanks, but both were repelled by our forces. Apart from reconnaissance activities and intermittent artillery fire, there has been no major development in other areas of the front. (1st, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: According to an official announcement last night, the French Somme River troops, after 48 hours of intense fighting, recaptured Abbeville on the coast yesterday, opening a bloody path for the Allied counterattack. A certain war analyst stated that General Weygand's troops have completely cleared the enemy from the Somme River estuary, capturing two hundred prisoners, and annihilating several enemy motorized units. It is estimated that 200,000 Allied troops are still trapped in the front. The Allied troops are continuously evacuating from Dunkirk, but they are fighting one against three in a desperate struggle. (1st, Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>Paris: The German army doubled its efforts yesterday to cut off the French rearguard troops who were fighting their way to the coast. However, the British and French forces are still holding the front highlands. According to a French military spokesman, the large bodies of water, up to two feet deep, to the north and south of Dunkirk have halted the movement of infantry and motorized units. Therefore, the British and French forces are able to continue boarding ships rapidly at the port. Some Belgian units did not comply with the surrender order and arrived in Dunkirk with their officers and the corps commander. At the same time, there were reports of intense fighting on the Somme front. French forces have recaptured western Abbeville. At another location near the mouth of the Somme River, French forces have crossed the river and secured a stronghold on the north bank. It is reported that French tanks played an important role in these battles. The Germans suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment. The French captured hundreds of enemy soldiers and seized some weapons and transportation vehicles for controlling tanks. In the province of Front, the Germans have assembled ten divisions of armored troops and three divisions of mechanized troops, in addition to the infantry, to confront a smaller number of Allied troops. According to French military sources, the German offensive in the area is large in scale, but the results are meager. According to reliable German sources known to the French, the German army has lost 500,000 men since May 10th. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>General Gort Arrives Safely in England; Awarded the Grand Cross</h3>
<p>London: The War Office announced that General Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, has made good progress in evacuating the Expeditionary Force from France and reducing the number of British troops still in northern France. He has now been ordered by the British government to transfer command of the troops remaining in France to a senior officer of higher rank. After arriving here this morning, the General was received by the King, who awarded him the Grand Cross of the Bath. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Allied Evacuation Continues Under Fire</p>
<p>London: Warships, transports, and various other vessels have been crossing the English Channel all night, returning from the front area with British and French troops. This evacuation is proceeding on a large scale today. The trains carrying troops returning from the front are running very smoothly today, arriving at several stations in the London area without stopping. The crowds and women carrying fresh flowers waiting at the stations were quite surprised to see the trains speed by. The troops are in high spirits. The carriage doors are inscribed with slogans such as "Returning home, but not for long" and "Hitler, are you serious? We haven't even started hitting you yet." According to some estimates, only one division of Allied troops remains in the front area. Ships transporting troops back to England immediately depart as soon as they dock, allowing other ships to come alongside. One port had a troop transport vessel quickly approaching. Just as the soldiers had finished disembarking, another ship tied up alongside it before the first ship had even left. This morning, a small boat carrying thirty soldiers, who had escaped Dunkirk under heavy fire without being hit, arrived. Among the troops disembarking this morning were a thousand French soldiers, including French colonial troops. The British did not retreat, so a large number of Allied troops were finally able to break through and turn danger into safety. According to soldiers who recently returned to England, Hitler suffered heavy losses because of his eagerness to encircle in the front area. According to one British soldier, "In one battle, the German casualties must have been over 25,000. Although the German army fell in rows under our fire, they still came like a tide, stepping over the corpses of their comrades." These soldiers who have returned "gloriously" are now on leave for temporary rest, allowing the authorities to adjust important affairs. The UK's immediate priority is whether to retain the full strength of the UK to defend against the expected German offensive, or to send another strong expeditionary force to the continent to help the French army hold the Somme line. Judging from the recent situation, after this great victory, the Germans seem to be intending to put pressure on Paris and may not immediately launch their blitzkrieg against the British Isles. The number of British soldiers who have survived is not yet estimated. It is said that of the original expeditionary force of 400,000 to 500,000, a large part have returned home, and the number who sacrificed in the rearguard battle is acknowledged to be considerable. The French army suffered even greater losses, and it is reported that they are still desperately resisting the German land attack. (1st, International Telegraph)</p>
<p>Germany Boasts of Three Weeks of War Results; Plans to Realize a Quick Victory Strategy</p>
<p>Berlin: Senior German officials yesterday gave a speech to the Haitong News Agency reporter, outlining the results of the German army's three-week offensive on the Western Front as follows: (1) The Belgian army has surrendered. (2) The French 1st, 7th, and 9th Armies have been completely defeated in the front. (3) The British Expeditionary Force has been completely annihilated. (4) The Maginot Line has been broken through, extending 300 kilometers from Dunkirk to Montmédy. (5) The German front line, from Abbeville along the Meuse River to the closest point of Sedan, is only 100 kilometers from Paris. (6) The German army, navy, and air force have reached Calais, the closest part of the English Channel, and control the mouth of the Thames River. The German air force is bombing the enemy's supply lines and industrial production centers. (7) The German front line has shifted 300 kilometers westward, making supply no problem. Not only has the British and French plan to attack Germany's industrial Ruhr area failed, but they have also lost some industrial areas of Belgium and France. (1st, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin: Military circles here predicted at 8 pm last night that the remnant Allied forces trapped in the front would be annihilated within 24 hours. After the annihilation of these remaining forces, the German army will be free to drive straight towards Paris and London. Authoritative circles say that Germany's victory "has now become a fact." The German army is awaiting orders for a decisive battle. They declared, "No one knows when this order will be issued, but we are certain that this decision will make all previous illusions of military force pale in comparison." They acknowledge that the British Expeditionary Force is stubbornly resisting on a 27-mile deep and six-mile wide stretch of land attached to the Channel port of Dunkirk. However, the German news agency said that the German navy and artillery yesterday attacked the German front along the coast. (Associated Press Telegraph, Day) A soldier on one ship, they fought to the death in the Ypres area and only withdrew yesterday. Another ship carried Allied artillerymen who opened heavy fire until the last minute. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Belgian Coastal Towns Turned Into Scorched Earth</p>
<p>London: The largest rearguard battle in history is about to end. Several tens of thousands of British troops have escaped the German trap and returned to England. The German army has used its powerful land and air forces to pounce on the Belgian coast, which has become a scene of scorched earth. But the brave British and French troops are holding the small area around Dunkirk.</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a recent communique stating that German forces captured a total of 26,000 enemy soldiers in the Lille area. The German attack on the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force on both sides of Dunkirk met with fierce resistance. Although the terrain is very rugged, they are now gradually pressing forward. The German army sank five enemy transport ships, and three cruisers or destroyers and ten merchant ships were heavily damaged. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Two New Classes of British Recruits Continue to Enlist</h3>
<p>London: Two new classes of recruits will enlist in June. Some of them will be assigned to the military industry. Thereafter, the number of active military personnel will increase to 2.8 million, not including the reserve army, naval and air forces, and parachute defense teams. (31st, Havas Telegraph)</p>

<h3>The Multi-faceted Struggle in Southeastern Europe</h3>
<p>Recently, with the intense progress of the war in Western Europe, Italy's attitude can be described as having exhausted all its evasive tactics. The idea that Italy would join the German side in the war has not only long been rumored around the world, but even newspapers published in Italy itself have been fueling the flames and exaggerating the claim. However, until recently, Italy has still not formally entered the war vortex, one of the main reasons being that there are inevitable contradictions and conflicts between Italy and Germany. The existence of a powerful Germanic state in the north is by no means a blessing for Italy. The thousand years of Italian history before the 19th century is clear evidence of this. Therefore, from a certain point of view, Mussolini is hoping that Hitler will not completely defeat the United Kingdom and France and monopolize Europe. But on the other hand, Italy is, after all, an opportunist country, and its national spirit is rich in foreign aggression. And what Italy is particularly concerned about is that if it maintains its neutrality for a long time, it will reduce its prestige in the international arena of Europe. It will not be able to obtain significant gains in the current European war, nor will it be easy to occupy a controlling position in the future peace conference. Therefore, given that Germany's offensive in the Netherlands and Belgium is currently progressing quite smoothly, Italy's joining the German side to fight against Britain and France is far more likely than its continuing to maintain neutrality. From various aspects, speculating on Italy's future form of participation in the war, it may take the form of a "surprise attack." Its main "surprise" targets would be no more than three: (1) Switzerland or the Franco-Italian border; (2) the British Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus Islands, and the French Corsica and Tunisia; (3) the Balkan Peninsula. Of these three, the Balkans are rich in resources and have long been coveted by impoverished Italy.</p>
<p>But the current situation in the Balkans is extremely complicated, which can also be said to be an important reason for Italy's hesitation. When the First World War broke out in 1914, the Balkans were the fuse. In the twenty years after the war, the Balkans themselves remained unstable, and the major European powers also sought to continue developing their influence there in various ways. Since the start of the Second World War last year, the multi-faceted struggle in the Balkan region has intensified even more. One is Germany. Germany's economic relations with Southeast Europe have always been deep. Germany's imports of food and important raw materials can be supplied by the Balkan countries by 50% (except for wool, hemp, rubber, cotton, and coffee). In addition, if Germany wants to defeat Britain, it must not only fight Britain in Western Europe, but also compete with Britain in the Near East and the Middle East. The Balkans are precisely the road that must be passed when it advances. Germany has not abandoned the so-called "Three B Railway" (Berlin - Istanbul - Baghdad) plan. The decision is up to Britain and France. Britain and France have shallower trade relations with Southeastern Europe, but have more industrial investment in the Balkan countries. And if Britain and France want to check Germany from the rear, or want to maintain the freedom of traffic on the Mediterranean Sea, or maintain the security of their Near Eastern oil production areas, they all rely on the friendly neutrality of the Balkan countries. Therefore, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia last spring, Britain and France immediately issued a statement guaranteeing Greece and Romania, and signed a mutual assistance treaty with Turkey in October. The third is Italy. The Balkan region is the main supplier of food and raw materials for Italy. In military terms, Italy must ensure the security of its east coast and maintain its own traffic to its East African colonies, all of which must first seek to control the Balkans. Therefore, last year, following Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Italy forcibly occupied Albania and sought to interfere in Yugoslavia. Recently, Italian-Yugoslav relations have been very bad. For example, on October 16, Italians held a large-scale anti-Yugoslav demonstration. The fourth is the Soviet Union. Since the end of the First World War, the Soviet Union has adopted a more passive policy towards the Balkans. But the conclusion of the German-Soviet Pact last year strengthened the Soviet Union's position in Southeastern Europe. The Soviet Union has always longed to control the southern gateway of the Black Sea in order to enter and exit the Mediterranean. Now is a good opportunity for her to develop her power. The fifth is Turkey. In the past twenty years, Turkey has been striving for strength and is implicitly the leader of the Balkans. Turkey's policy values diplomacy, but does not rely on external protection. Therefore, in 1934, she united with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia to form the Balkan Entente, in order to jointly resist aggression and protect security. In February of this year, the Balkan Entente countries met in the capital of Yugoslavia and reiterated their unwavering commitment to the above-mentioned purpose.</p>
<p>At present, there are at least the above five forces competing in the multi-faceted struggle in Eastern and Western Europe. Among them, Germany and Britain and France are fighting with all their strength in Western Europe, gambling on the fate of their countries. The Balkan countries under the leadership of Turkey are limited by their strength. In terms of speaking out independently, there is still a lack. The remaining major competitors are Italy and the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia is of the same bloodline as the Soviet Union. In view of Italy's extreme pressure, it released its suspicion and reconciled with the Soviet Union last month and signed a commercial agreement. Soviet-Turkish relations have always been cordial. Bulgaria is also a mixed Slavic race, which is congenitally prone to leaning towards the Soviet Union. This is the advantage that the Soviet Union occupies. Germany has always acted as a mediator between the Soviet Union and Italy, attempting to promote their compromise. However, the conflict of interests between the Soviet Union and Italy in Southeastern Europe is not easy to eliminate. This mediation has not been successful to date, and its future is worth paying attention to. Judging from the foreign telegrams obtained in the past twenty-four hours, Italy's entry into the European War is already imminent. If it does, the consequences of this multi-faceted struggle in Southeastern Europe will undoubtedly seriously affect the future development of Anglo-Soviet relations and even the entire European situation.</p>
<h3>Heroic Deeds Will Live Forever; Allied Soldiers Returning Home; Detailed Account of Battlefield Situation; Weary and Sad-Faced; But Their Will Remains Unbroken</h3>
<p>London: Today, tens of thousands of British Expeditionary Force soldiers returning from the front passed through here, including many support and home guard service personnel. According to these soldiers speaking to the Reuters interviewer, the casualty ratio between the British Expeditionary Force and the German army is at least one to five. The British army has demonstrated the superiority of its fighting power in battles everywhere. However, every soldier's mouth is filled with the cry of "For God's sake, give us more planes." Although the soldiers have encountered tragic situations, they are weary and sad-faced, and many are still wearing steel helmets with various camouflage materials still attached. However, they are all full of spirit and strong in will. According to some soldiers, they withdrew from Dunkirk through a hail of bullets. The German planes attacked in batches, each up to sixty. Although our army shot down dozens of them, they immediately replenished their numbers and continued bombing. A French ship struck a magnetic mine and sank. Only one of the French soldiers on board swam for a long time and was rescued. It is said that in the past three days, the beaches of Dunkirk and the surrounding sands have been filled with garrison troops waiting to be evacuated. When the German planes hovered in the sky, they dropped bombs and opened machine guns. Yesterday, the troops were attacked by fifty planes, but only one person was killed and one injured, because everyone was hiding in anticipation. The German artillery is now attacking Dunkirk and the surrounding area, so the danger in the area is even greater than before. Many troops mentioned the large number of German tanks and armored vehicles. One young artilleryman said, "We are using field guns like machine guns to bombard them. We can always stop them, but then other tanks suddenly appear on our side, so we have to retreat again to drive them out." One sergeant said that the British army is brave and good at fighting. Even in dangerous situations, they never panic. When each soldier landed at the pier, they threw their rifles on the ground, accumulating several huge piles. (31st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: Hundreds of thousands of British Expeditionary Force soldiers are crossing the English Channel in various ships, returning home one after another and arriving on the southeastern coast. Although they look tired, they are still smiling. Crowds gathered on the beaches and clifftops to greet them with cheers. When the soldiers disembarked and lined up to go to the train station, members of the Women's Voluntary Service Corps, working in eight-hour shifts, shared food, tea, and cigarettes with the soldiers. Some wounded soldiers, lying on stretchers, have also landed. Returning soldiers today talked to guests about their deeds in fighting the superior German army. One soldier said that the troops who boarded the ship in Dunkirk early yesterday morning were heavily bombarded by German long-range guns, which hit several times. However, the British and French navies completely control the city. The city is constantly being bombarded and bombed, and fires are breaking out in many places. Few houses are left. Other soldiers also described the dense attack of 200 German planes, saying that the Royal Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down many enemy planes. An officer who just returned to England from Dunkirk today told a Reuters reporter that the German plane bombing has a deafening effect, but the loss of life is minimal. This point has been confirmed from many sources. The officer also said that the German soldiers, once away from their tanks, are no longer as fierce as the German soldiers in the previous Great War. One officer said that the area is full of spies. He said that when he was about to board the ship at the beach, someone wearing a British officer's uniform approached him and spoke fluent English, saying that he needed to order his troops to move two more miles along the beach. Just as he was about to give the order, he met a naval officer who told him that there was no order to move the troops. An hour later, the location two miles away had been bombed to pieces. London naval circles say that the cooperation between the navy, army, and air force was extremely satisfactory when the troops were evacuated from the Belgian coast. Moreover, the warships and other vessels evacuated were working in shallow water, often suffering from poor lighting and the most intense bombing imaginable. Therefore, sailing and driving ships in narrow spaces required skilled techniques. It is reported that the protection given to the ships by the planes was very effective. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Press Praises</h3>
<p>LONDON - This morning, various newspapers here in London, when reporting on the miracle of the British forces in northern France escaping forced surrender or annihilation, used unusually cheerful language, unseen for many days. All newspapers gave the news headlines in large font, such as "British Air Force Turns Defeat into Victory" and "Retreat More Successful Than Expected." The Times stated that the most difficult and dangerous military operation is undoubtedly covering the embarkation of the majority of troops under artillery fire. The difficulty of this kind of military action is even greater in the era of mechanized warfare and aerial bombardment, as all movements cannot be hidden from the enemy's eyes. Troops were embarking amidst a hail of bullets, and the terrain was mostly exposed beaches. The Navy, except for destroyers, could not use larger warships. Maintaining resistance under the aforementioned unfavorable circumstances depended on the perfect understanding and cooperation of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as allied nations including Belgian troops who refused to lay down their arms, to be effective. One thing is most important: the troops currently being transported back to England are not like fugitives from a failed campaign, but an entire unbroken unit. Although the number has decreased, their discipline has been tempered by the experiences of war and is as strong as steel. After necessary rest, they will be ready to undertake new tasks in the war. The situation is similar for French army corps that need to travel further to designated ports for embarkation, but the number of arrivals is increasing daily. The Daily Telegraph reported that the heroic feat completed by the Allied forces this time, which is hard to believe, will be listed as one of the most famous and glorious battles of the British Army. The Daily Mail reported that the retreat from the front has written an immortal history of heroism and perseverance. The News Chronicle stated that the facts of this retreat provide a new interpretation of the old debate between warships and aircraft. The countless ships that participated in assisting this retreat also suffered minor damage. If it were not for the almost superhuman achievements of the British Air Force, the losses would undoubtedly have been much greater than at present. However, the numerically superior Nazi air force did not prevent the retreat from proceeding. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<h3>German Troops Charge, Tanks Equipped with Sharp Blades</h3>
<p>LONDON - According to a British artilleryman arriving here, speaking to a reporter from the Associated Press, he was still fighting on the Ypres front four days ago. He and other soldiers had provided artillery cover for the Allied forces for 36 hours. During the artillery bombardment, they had even heard the Germans requesting a brief pause to bury the dead. They continued firing for another six hours after hearing this request, with the artillery fire becoming even more intense than before. From his perspective, the German losses must have been very heavy. Another British soldier said that German tanks charged and crashed into everything regardless of any obstacles ahead, never stopping slightly. Their giant tanks were equipped with sharp blades to cut down obstacles. The most difficult places were opened up by these blades. Soldiers arriving here yesterday praised the Allied fleet's assistance in the evacuation work. (Associated Press dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<h3>British Press on Modern Warfare: Naval Power Still Important</h3>
<p>LONDON - An editorial in The Times, titled "The Grasp of the Ocean," emphasized that while the power of the air force has increased in this war, naval power still occupies an important position. It stated, "One must never forget that the real struggle is for control of the ocean. The enemy is now sparing no effort to rush towards the ports of the English Channel, which shows that they have not forgotten the main obstacle to world domination. Naval power today is even more powerful than in the past. Modern armies, whether on the ground or in the air, cannot move or fight without being supplied from afar."

<h3>Belgian Parliament Passes Motion: Condemns Leopold for Surrendering to the Enemy, Considers Him Legally Unable to Reclaim the Throne, Prime Minister Declares Resolution to Fight Freely to the End</h3>
<p>PARIS - In a moving and memorable meeting last night, the Belgian Parliament unanimously passed a motion declaring that it adopts the same attitude as the Belgian government, recognizing that King Leopold can no longer legally and morally reclaim the throne. The motion was passed unanimously by all 89 members of the House of Representatives and 54 Senators present, with no dissenters. In addition to the above, its content further stipulates: (1) condemning King Leopold's surrender, the historical responsibility for which should be borne by him alone; (2) paying tribute to the soldiers who died defending Belgium's independence; (3) expressing admiration for the Belgian army that has suffered unexpected pain; (4) believing deeply that Belgian youth will soon restore our flag to the front lines; (5) expressing fervent sympathy to the compatriots in the occupied areas of Belgium, believing that their patriotic spirit has not wavered. The resolution declares the determination to continue fighting alongside the Allied powers with all the troops of Belgium and its colonies to resist the enemy's aggression, and will not stop until the goal of restoring the country is achieved. Finally, it expresses deep gratitude to Britain and France for accommodating Belgian refugees, and reiterates the firm belief that justice and glory will ultimately prevail. Belgian Senate President Gysels confirmed the fact that some Belgian troops had refused to obey King Leopold's surrender order and were fighting alongside Allied forces in northern France. According to reports, the above meeting was of a semi-official nature and was held in Limoges, France, to report the government's actions to members of both houses of parliament. It is said that there are currently only about 150 Belgian senators in France, which is less than half of the total, so it is impossible to change the two-thirds majority required by Italian law. Although this meeting was of an informal nature, the atmosphere of the venue will occupy an important place in the history of the Belgian Parliament. The Mayor of Limoges gave a welcoming speech at the opening of the meeting, concluding by saying, "We must win so that your beloved Belgium can return to strength and freedom. After the victory of the Allied forces, freedom may not disappear from mankind." After the Mayor finished speaking, the crowd thanked France, and many Belgians were moved to tears. The Presidents of the Belgian Senate and House of Representatives and Prime Minister Pierlot successively spoke, expressing Belgium's determination to fight alongside the Allied forces until freedom is restored. During their speeches, people shouted slogans such as "Long Live France" and "Long Live Belgium." (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<h3>Espionage Case Cracked in London</h3>
<p>LONDON - A woman and two men were detained for violating the National Defence Act. When their case was tried in Plymouth yesterday, the details were shocking. The woman's name is Inkerlem, 42 years old. Her husband is currently a sergeant in the Royal Air Force, and she is related to a staff officer in the German High Command by marriage. She is accused of seeking to obtain information about tanks to supply to the enemy. The two men, Swift, 57 years old, and Wasser, 40 years old, are both accomplices. The woman obtained British citizenship by marrying an Englishman. Her parents are both German and quite anti-British. She currently works in the home of a senior naval officer who holds an important position in the Admiralty. The woman often made anti-British statements, and once told him that when the German army entered Britain, the British royal family and cabinet members would be publicly executed, and Sir Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist Party, would be the ruler of England. The prosecuting attorney stated in court that if the woman's crimes had been discovered a week later, she would have been sentenced to death. (Reuter's dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<h3>Ma Zhenwu Flies from Chongqing to Gansu</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Ma Zhenwu, the leader of the Zheherenye Sufi order, is the successor of the former religious leader Ma Shanren Yuanzhang. He has been leading millions of followers in the Northwest for many years. In the 24th year of the Republic, he went to Peiping to recuperate, but due to the "July 7th Incident," transportation was blocked, and he was unable to leave Peiping under strict Japanese surveillance. Recently, he disguised himself and detoured to Chongqing. After meeting with the central authorities, he gave a speech before flying to Gansu yesterday morning, as follows: "I went to Peiping for medical treatment due to a chronic illness. Unexpectedly, the incident suddenly occurred, and I was detained in Peiping, witnessing the various actions of the Japanese, which were outrageous. This time, I detoured to Chongqing and was deeply favored and treated by the President and the central leaders, who gave me various instructions. I am infinitely grateful. Although the cultural level of the compatriots in the Northwest is relatively backward, their patriotic enthusiasm is second to none. From now on, I pledge to uphold the overall national policy of resistance under the leadership of the President, contribute our existing strength, and promote production and education, so that our compatriots, who constitute a major component of the great Chinese nation, will have a more glorious performance in the process of resistance, and not fail the earnest expectations of the central government."

<h3>US President's Message to Congress - Requests Additional Defense Funds - 1 Billion US Dollars to Enhance Strength - Closely Monitor People Inside and Outside US Borders</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to allocate additional defense funds, increasing the request for rearmament to US$5,000,000,000. A few hours after the President's message was submitted, the Senate passed the Fifth Reorganization Bill by a vote of 55 to 4. Its purpose is to facilitate the elimination of "Fifth Column" elements. According to this law, immigration affairs will be transferred to the Department of Justice, which will closely monitor all foreigners within the United States. The bill has been passed by the House of Representatives, and because the Senate has made amendments, it is planned to resubmit the bill to the House of Representatives for amendment. (1st, United Press)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a supplementary emergency program of more than 1 billion yuan to Congress and requested immediate discussion without delay. According to President Roosevelt, due to the "almost unbelievable" events that have occurred in Europe in the past two weeks, especially as a result of the use of aviation and mechanical equipment, this recent expansion of the program is necessary. There is a possibility that not only one or two continents but all continents will be involved in a worldwide war. If this continues, the United States must make its defense more solid to seek reasonable protection. Official sources then stated that the defense expenditures proposed by President Roosevelt to be increased total 700 million yuan for the army and 675 million yuan for the navy. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently submitted a message to Congress requesting an additional $1 billion (originally $1,182,000,000) in temporary defense funds to immediately strengthen the strength of the army and navy. "The army and navy have now put forward emergency plans, requesting additional funds to manufacture artillery and munitions. At a time when the situation is becoming increasingly serious, the implementation of this measure is indeed not allowed to be delayed." According to the usual defense budget and temporary expenses of the United States, the current amount is $1,823,000,000 for the army and $1,473,000,000 for the navy, totaling $3,296,000,000. With the addition of another $1 billion, the total will reach as much as $4.3 billion. (31st, Havas)</p>

<h3>US Senator Townsend Reintroduces Silver Bill - Removes Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>Washington - Senator Townsend has reintroduced his famous silver bill to the Senate after amending it and removing the tax regulations. According to the previous discussion of the bill in the House of Representatives, because the Italian law stipulates that all taxation systems must be done by the House of Representatives, the bill contained tax clauses, which hindered the legal rights of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the leaders decided by a vote of 45 to 36 to return the bill to the Senate. According to the bill, the right to purchase foreign silver under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 is terminated, and a 50% tax is levied on all silver transfers. However, this plan does not prevent the purchase of limited silver previously promised or opened by the equalization fund. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Colonial Minister Announces - Colonial Policy - Actively Immigrating to the Northeast</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Local educational administrative personnel recently held a meeting here, and Colonial Minister General Koiso also attended. He immediately delivered a speech on Japan's colonial policy, stating in summary that there are currently more than 20,000 households of Japanese people who have emigrated to "Manchukuo," and it is planned to send another 20,000 households this year. Although domestic labor is increasingly needed, efforts must be redoubled to colonize "Manchukuo." In addition, there are an increasing number of our country's youth who aspire to go to "Manchukuo" and engage in development with the natives. Previously, there were more than 30,000 people, and another 30,000 will be sent this year. As for the economic development of the South Pacific islands, it is extremely important and is a source of raw materials. At this time when the "China Incident" has developed and the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, Japan's expansion there must be handled with caution. (31st, Havas)</p>

<h3>Hitler Receives Italian Ambassador - British-Italian Trade Negotiations Break Down - Italian Prime Minister Cables US President, Says He Intends to Keep Promise to Aid Germany - France Watches Italian Involvement in War with Full Attention</h3>
<p>Berlin - Hitler received Italian Ambassador Alfieri yesterday at his forward headquarters on the Western Front. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - It was widely rumored here yesterday that Germany and Italy would soon issue an ultimatum to Switzerland, demanding that their troops pass through Swiss territory to attack France. Rumors also stated that Germany might present peace terms to France directly or through Italy. However, some believe that Germany must first capture Paris before presenting peace terms.

<p>London - It is heard that the British-Italian negotiations on the contraband control agreement have broken down. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - British and Italian discussions on trade relations and the blockade had reached a compromise in principle, but the Italian side suddenly suspended negotiations on May 28. Political figures here commented that the Italian authorities do not want to ease relations with Britain and France and have decided to end their non-belligerent policy and participate in the war in some form, but the date has not yet been decided. According to a certain observer, the Italian authorities may continue to blackmail for some time in the hope that Britain and France will concede again. However, Britain and France have adopted a firm attitude and cannot negotiate with Italy. They will inevitably put pressure on Italy in economic and financial aspects, and Italy's blackmail strategy will only see its efforts exhausted. In short, Britain and France have taken all preventive measures in all aspects and can cope with any eventuality. (31st, Havas)</p>
<p>London - Surprise has been expressed here at the news of the Italian government's decisive rejection of the principles agreed upon in the recent talks in Rome. These talks were initiated by the Italian government and resulted in the drafting of a solution that would have provided a completely satisfactory solution to the Italian side's dissatisfaction with contraband control. As the naval permit system has been expanded, there will be no interference with or actual interference with Italian ships passing through British control stations. As for the Italian side, it recognizes in principle that it will not transport certain types of imported goods to the enemy as an exchange condition. Certain detailed issues remain to be discussed and there is no reason to believe that these issues will lead to any difficulties or delays. However, Italy's decision does not appear to be due to any actual issues currently under consideration. According to a telecommunication from Rome, Italy's sudden change is due to the intervention of extremely high aspects. It is unwise for us to speculate what the omen of this attitude is before we receive an explanation. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>Milan - French military and political figures are watching Italy with "full attention." What is being discussed by military and political figures in the French capital now is the issue of Italian participation in the war. A meeting was held yesterday to discuss this matter, attended by Premier Reynaud, Deputy Premier General Pétain, General Weygand, Admiral Darlan, and Air Force Commander General Vuillemin. (1st, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Italian Public Opinion Attitude - Advocates War Against Britain and France</p>
<p>Rome - The semi-official magazine "International Relations" published an article stating: "The opportunity we have been waiting for for fifty years has now arrived. The Italian people will fight the two enemies, France and England, with the greatest determination until complete victory. Italy's demands on the Mediterranean are only asking for natural rights. Italy's military and political powers rely on the Mediterranean. France and England alone can hold the political power of the Mediterranean, and thus implement control over Italy's development. This is illogical. Since France and England deny Italy's demands, Italy will take them by force. The era of emotional and useless imitation has passed. Today, the only imitation that is important is the supreme interests of the Italian people. The Italian people are a nation of laborers. This characteristic gives them the undeniable right. Those who are selfish and possess abundant resources and refuse to make public distributions must give them up today. The eyes of the Italians are increasingly focused on Tunis, the right to support people there was built by the hard work of several generations of Italian farmers, and on Corsica and Nice, which are traditionally owned by Italians and should be returned to Italians according to the needs of national security. Also, they are focused on Djibouti and Suez, whose wealth was created by the Italian Empire and developed by Italian industry. The people ruled by Mussolini today are able to undertake the great task of the highest glory of national revival. The land, sea, and air forces of Fascist Italy today all abide by this statement."

<h3>Rumor of a Secret Treaty Between Italy and Japan - Japan to Maintain Abyssinia When Italy Enters the War</h3>
<p>Rome - According to reliable sources, Italy and Japan have established a treaty to help Italy economically and maintain Abyssinia when Italy enters the war. Therefore, Italy's joining the Allies seems even closer today. It is heard that a delegation of Japanese economic figures discussed plans with the Italian government in Rome this week to assist Italy in Abyssinia. Most well-informed sources said that the treaty has been established and that the delegation has since returned to Japan via Venice without returning to Rome, as its mission has been completed.

<h3>Spanish Newspaper Demands Return of Gibraltar - Madrid Students Protest Against Britain</h3>
<p>Madrid - The Spanish Falangist newspaper "Arriba" recently published an article demanding that Britain return Gibraltar to Spain. It said, "The British side, because it has signed a commercial agreement with our country and lent millions of pounds to our country, believes that the relations between the two countries are completely friendly. However, our country is not satisfied with this. What our country wants is to recover the port of Gibraltar. If there is a Gibraltar issue between Britain and France, it will be difficult to be completely harmonious. The port was originally our country's territory, and no foreign flag should be allowed to fly there except for our country's flag. In addition, we must declare that our raising this demand is not due to the current European war, nor is it related to the sound of bombs heard by Britain at the port of Calais in France and other ports along the English Channel. In short, it would be wise for Britain to voluntarily return Gibraltar to our country." (31st, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid - Madrid University students gathered in front of the British Embassy to protest, shouting "Gibraltar is Spanish territory." This demonstration was clearly intended to coincide with the arrival of Sir Samuel Hoare, who was here on a special mission from the British government to negotiate. Spanish newspapers have been reporting on the movement to return Gibraltar to Spain for the past two days. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Discusses the European Situation</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki met with reporters yesterday and made a statement on the tense situation in Europe, declaring that Hungary need not worry, because our silence has helped the Allied Powers of Germany and Italy maintain order and peace in the Balkans and the Danube Basin. The preventive measures we have taken, at home and abroad, can be understood. The general concern that the European war will be prolonged is now unlikely, because the victories won by the German army may end the war in a short period of time. This must be welcomed by all small countries. If the war is prolonged, even if small countries can maintain neutrality, they will not be able to sustain it economically for a long time.

<h3>India to Continue Expanding Army - Air Force to Increase Fourfold</h3>
<p>Simla - General Cassels, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Garrison, declared last night that the Indian Army would continue to increase by about 100,000 people. The new army of India in the future will include motorized and mechanized units. The Indian Air Force will also increase fourfold. The current situation in France shows that the war is in danger of spreading. India will inevitably be affected by the enemy's actions. The defense forces will continue to be strengthened. British and Indian officers will step up training, and the production of ammunition will be accelerated. Since the outbreak of the war, the Indian regular army has already undergone its first expansion, increasing by more than 53,000 people. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>Background to the European War</p>
<h3>Record of the Mission of Disgrace to Germany (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Abridged Translation of Sir Nevile Henderson's Original Work</p>
<p>In May, at a banquet hosted by the Anglo-German Association, I delivered a pro-German speech, attempting to improve Anglo-German relations. This was the first instance of my taking matters into my own hands. The second was my participation in the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress in September. The ambassadors of Great Britain, France, and the United States had always regarded this congress as an informal gathering related only to the party headquarters, and each time excused themselves from attending. At the 1937 Congress, I, along with French Ambassador François-Poncet, and American Chargé d'Affaires Gilbert, attended at the direction of our respective governments, limiting our time to two days. Hitler was very pleased to see the diplomatic representatives of Great Britain, France, and the United States attending together, and was particularly fond of me personally, knowing that this was at my instigation.</p>
<p>During a luncheon, I had a long conversation with Propaganda Minister Goebbels about the issue of mutual attacks in the newspapers of our two countries. Although there was nothing new in what was discussed, no good solution was ever found. However, Dr. Goebbels' attitude was reasonable and amiable, which was commendable. He was known as "Little Doctor," and intellectually, he was indeed one of the brightest stars among the National Socialist Party leaders. He never gave speeches? He loved to argue, and in private conversation, he was fair-minded. I enjoyed talking to him. Judging by his appearance, he was a typical Irish agitator. Born in the Rhineland, he studied at a Catholic Jesuit school. He was small and slightly lame, but his courage in fighting the communists in Berlin was extraordinary. When he took to debating or writing, all his words, no matter how vicious or deceitful, were always at his disposal.</p>
<p>I then had a long talk with Aviation Minister Göring. Although the issue of the annexation of Austria was touched upon, most of the time was spent urging him to list the specific facts of the so-called attempts by England to encircle Germany, and what Germany's ultimate goals were. I had already requested a written answer to this question in July. Although Göring was always ready to talk to me and was willing to express his opinions, pending "Hitler's approval," such a written answer was ultimately a pipe dream. However, during this conversation, Göring invited me to go hunting in Rominten, East Prussia, in early October, saying that there might be news to tell me then. I readily agreed.</p>
<p>Göring was often frank and sometimes even indignant, but my interactions with him were open and honest, and our attitudes were always very harmonious. He was not as constantly driven by personal grievances as Hitler and Ribbentrop. He genuinely wanted to live in peace and have good relations with England, but he also warned me that if the British Empire did not cooperate with Germany, Germany would have no choice but to destroy it.</p>
<p>Whether he instigated the Reichstag fire in 1933, or whether Hitler entrusted him with overseeing the large-scale purge in Berlin during the 1934 purge, Göring, although perhaps the most sympathetic among the National Socialist Party leaders in peacetime, was as cruel as in war in times of crisis. He once told me that the Englishman he admired was the type of Drake, a "pirate-like figure," and that modern Englishmen had lost too much of their strength. In fact, he was also a typical pirate, but he had many endearing qualities, and I personally liked him the most.</p>
<p>There were many anecdotes about Göring, mostly making fun of his love of medals, but none of them were too serious. In my view, he did his best to mediate for peace in 1938, and if his courage and strength of character could have been matched by his physical exuberance, he might still have been able to save the situation in 1939.</p>
<p>In early October, I went to Rominten, East Prussia, for a hunt. Göring was very hospitable. The villa was thatched, and the interior was comfortably equipped with everything one could need. The attendants were all maids, with only one male servant. The guests and host were informal in their comings and goings. I drove up as the sun was shining faintly, and we prepared to go hunting together at four o'clock in the afternoon. As we set off, Göring teased me, saying that although Englishmen were good at using shotguns, they did not know how to use rifles. A week earlier, he had invited an English hunter to hunt deer, and he had missed three times.</p>
<p>I felt like cold water had been poured over my head when I heard this, but I was not discouraged. When we reached the forest, I caught sight of a deer, and I shot it through the heart. The next morning, I shot another one, and the English reputation for being good hunters was preserved. I stayed for two days, enjoying myself so much that I forgot to return. In nature, there is no such thing as nationalism or socialism. The only feeling is that all human beings are equal.</p>
<p>Earlier, Göring had planned to hold a hunting exhibition in Berlin in November 1937. I learned after taking office that almost all European countries were preparing to participate, except for England. I urgently telegraphed the Foreign Office, requesting that preparations be made to join. Although it was late, we managed to catch up.</p>
<p>The Germans were very organized, and the hunting exhibition was a great success. Although Hitler did not like hunting and opposed the killing of animals in principle, he reluctantly attended. Göring was very pleased that England participated.</p>
<p>There is one thing in particular related to this exhibition that is worth mentioning, namely, that Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal (who had already been appointed Foreign Secretary), was able to take the opportunity to visit Berlin. To avoid external misunderstandings, this trip was presented as being of a personal nature. The person behind this was Mr. Chamberlain, who intended to promote friendship between the two countries by taking advantage of the opportunity for important figures from England and Germany to interact with each other. His intentions were good.</p>
<p>Hitler was deeply impressed by Lord Halifax's vision and sincerity. The general public in Germany also felt that this trip was a sufficient indication of England's sincerity towards Germany. However, those in the party and government circles remained indifferent. Afterwards, Göring asked me, "Is Prime Minister Chamberlain really sincere? Can he really change the anti-National Socialist sentiment in England? Can he really avoid copying the old articles of the League of Nations, collective security, and France's policy of encirclement?" This was the orthodox view in Germany of British policy. Although Hitler had repeatedly declared that he was willing to reconcile with England, he was all talk and no action. He knew that he had pressing matters such as the annexation of Austria, so how could he sacrifice his Central European ambitions to gain such understanding? The Anglo-German reconciliation that he had in mind was simply England accepting his plan to transform Central Europe.</p>
<p>On January 12, 1938, the German newspapers revealed that Defense Minister Werner von Blomberg was marrying a woman named Fräulein Gruhn, which was the prelude to a tragedy within Germany, not to put it too strongly. The previous evening, I had been invited to a banquet at the Propaganda Ministry by Funk, the current Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank. At the end of the banquet, Funk announced the marriage of General von Blomberg and Fräulein Gruhn. Everyone present, about sixty people, was stunned and asked about Fräulein Gruhn's background. It was soon learned that the political police had a record of her. She was a dissolute and beautiful woman. I privately surmised that this was probably the work of the sinister political police chief Himmler, hoping to eliminate dissidents.</p>
<p>Hitler's personal feelings and his reputation were greatly affected by this. Blomberg was not only one of Hitler's most trusted men, but disaster struck close to home. Hitler intended to use the excuse that Blomberg had been fooled by someone and sarcastically ordered him to dissolve the marriage. Blomberg refused to listen, and Hitler felt a sense of being abandoned by his followers.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party was on good terms with Blomberg and initially had no reservations about him, but the army generals were not. The radicals in the party were also at odds with him because of his interference in military affairs. Army Commander-in-Chief General von Fritsch, supported by the generals and the veteran generals of the previous war, such as Mackensen, reported directly to the Führer without waiting for Hitler to take action, saying that Blomberg, as Minister of Defense, was marrying a libertine woman, and military discipline was gone, which was intolerable. However, how could a dictator tolerate being commanded by others? Hitler, on the one hand, did not want to be controlled by others, and on the other hand, wanted to show his friendship to his old friend, so he initially firmly refused to dismiss Blomberg. Fritsch went further, not only criticizing the issue of military discipline, but also criticizing Hitler's foreign policy, especially his policy towards Austria. This was something that Hitler could not tolerate.</p>
<p>Later, Fritsch left his post, as did Blomberg. At that time, what Hitler was thinking about deeply was how to deal with the situation in a way that would benefit him, or at least not lose face. Three weeks later, on February 4, after his first major outburst of anger that year, Hitler announced the dismissal of these two important figures, and at the same time used the transfer and promotion of army, navy, air force, and diplomatic personnel as a smokescreen. Except for the diplomatic circles, the transfer of this group of personnel, other than the dismissal of Fritsch and Blomberg, did not attract much attention. The remaining people would be transferred months later. Afterwards, Hitler seized military power. In general, Hitler's means of overcoming difficulties cannot be said to have been slow, and he swept away the imperialist conservatives in the army. Conservative Foreign Minister Neurath was also replaced by the extremist Ribbentrop. (To be continued)</p>

Western Youth's Mantos Li won both the shot put and javelin, but his performance seemed weaker than in the past. In the one-mile race, where many heroes gathered, Xiong Wang Zhenglin, with his outstanding ability, led by nearly one hundred yards to win the championship in four minutes and thirty-nine seconds. He missed his own meeting record of four minutes and thirty-six and six tenths seconds by less than three seconds. Guan Youwen was still in second place at the last five yards, but was overtaken by Western Youth's Servis in the last three yards, falling to third place by a shoulder, which was a pity. However, famous athletes such as East Selah's Clemens Dimock and the School Federation's Wallace were all lapped by more than one lap. In the relay, the loss came from poor deployment of the team. In the preliminary and semi-final rounds, Edward showed his strength in the short-distance 100-yard and 220-yard races. Fonseca did not use his full strength. Wang Zhenshi and Chen Yongfu of the Chinese United team were both selected in the preliminary rounds, but were eliminated in the semi-finals. In the 440-yard race, Chinese United's famous athlete Dai Shuguo only participated in the one-mile relay yesterday and did not participate in his signature event, so he was not on the list either. In the preliminary round of the high hurdles, Li Zhenzhong won the first place in the second group with seventeen and seven tenths seconds, so there is high hope in the finals next week.</p>

<h3>International Mini-Soccer Preliminary Round, China Wins 7-1 Against Jewish, China, England, Portugal, and France Enter the Replay Week, Four Teams Compete for the Finals Title Today</h3>
<p>The international mini-soccer tournament with eight teams competing opened in the preliminary round yesterday. As a result, China, England, Portugal, and France all predictably advanced to the replay week with easy victories. Today, the English team, which struggled to win yesterday, will face the tough Portuguese team again, and it is difficult to predict the outcome, since Portugal, still basking in glory from the International Cup soccer championship, also has profound abilities in mini-soccer and is not only determined to win, but is also quite confident. This match between England and Portugal should be one of the most exciting games of the season. After the England-Portugal match, the Chinese team will play the French Commerce team. The French team is loud and powerful, and they also feel that the Chinese team is difficult to deal with, so the Chinese team's lineup today, in addition to the usual defense, will have center forward Sun Jinshun personally leading the team in order to increase the offensive. Both big matches will be exciting. The schedule for today and yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>England vs. Portugal (Replay) 3:30 PM</p>
<p>China vs. France (Replay) 4:50 PM</p>
<p>(Note) The Jewish vs. Russian B group final originally scheduled to be held today has been changed to next Sunday.</p>

<p>France def. Scotland 6-2</p>
<p>England def. Russia 4-3</p>
<p>Portugal def. Philippines 7-1</p>
<p>China def. Jewish 7-1</p>
<p>China vs. Jewish In the match against China, the Jewish team was arrogant and overconfident, but their skills were just so-so. The Chinese team's strength was sharp and powerful, and the Jewish team paled in comparison. Just as they got on the field, Chinese general Xiao Xintian was injured in a collision, so Gao Baozheng replaced him and scored two goals in a row. Chen Yuanji added icing to the cake, and the Chinese team led with three to zero in the first half, taking an absolute advantage. After switching sides, the Chinese team continued to work hard, and Gao Baozheng scored two more goals. After making it six to zero, the Jewish team finally pulled back one goal, but Meng Yiliang immediately retaliated. In the end, the Chinese team won with seven to one.</p>

<p>The Remaining Three Matches The situation was very different in the France vs. Scotland match. Kaolet and Bu Suli each scored a hat trick before the Scottish team cracked their own egg (scored a goal). In the second half, the French team quickly scored three more goals, and the Scottish team suffered a crushing defeat by two to six. The strength of Portugal and the Philippines was very different, forming a situation of egg against stone. The Philippines lost three goals in the first half, and then conceded three more in the second half before finally scoring, and then adding one more for a big win of seven to one. Fafan Xiao scored four goals. The Russian team was just starting, and they initially gave the English team an intimidating start. Later, the English team scored three goals in a row, and the Russian team forced the score to be tied at three each, making the situation even more tense. After struggling, the English team finally scored through McLaughland and eliminated the Russian team with a score of four to three.</p>

<h3>Schools at All Levels in This City Respond to Daylight Saving Time</h3>
<p>All sectors of this city began to implement daylight saving time yesterday. However, the school authorities have not yet expressed their position. According to educational authorities, in order to show their cooperation with this daylight saving time movement, schools at all levels in this city have decided to start classes one hour earlier starting tomorrow (Monday).</p>
<h3>Overview of the Central Government's Assistance to Refugee Children over the Past Three Years (Part 2) Receiving Over 30,000 People</h3>
<p>Relief Funds The emergency rescue of refugee children and the establishment of educational and care institutions are handled by the National Relief Commission. The funds are directly allocated by the commission. For those handled by local governments, the funds are allocated by the local governments. Various refugee children relief organizations raise funds from enthusiastic people from home and abroad to rescue refugee children and establish educational and care institutions. If the funds raised are insufficient and cannot cover the expenses, they may apply for subsidies from the National Relief Commission. If the local government's financial resources are insufficient, it may also apply for subsidies. The National Relief Commission has also formulated measures for refugee children relief organizations to apply for subsidies. The National Relief Commission has allocated over 3.8 million yuan for refugee children relief in the 28th and 29th years.</p>
<p>Educational and Care Overview Children are divided into infants and school-age children, and appropriate education and care are provided for each stage. Training focuses on cultivating habits of cleanliness and hygiene, as well as the spirit of labor. Group life guidance is provided. For older children, emphasis is placed on imparting practical skills, such as using farms as agricultural training centers, where they are taught gardening and animal husbandry. Factories are used as training centers for small-scale crafts, such as simple chemical crafts, making tofu, soy sauce, soap, and other chemical products. Simple bamboo and woodworking, mechanical printing, etc., are selected based on environmental needs. Stores and cooperatives are set up, paying attention to bookkeeping, accounting, and business training. In terms of household affairs, such as sewing and cooking, children are trained. All facilities contain elements of shame education and war preparedness. Older children also receive military education and participate in Boy Scout training. The class system is the same as in ordinary elementary schools. Grades one to four are elementary, and grades five and six are advanced. Each grade has a standard of 30 to 50 students. For children whose age and academic level are too far apart, and for children who cannot continue their education after graduating from elementary school, vocational classes are set up separately, divided into crafts, agriculture, business, and household affairs groups according to their nature. Vocational classes are divided into high and elementary levels according to the children's skills, and the duration of study is two years. If necessary, it can be extended by one year. The association stipulated last year that the monthly cost for each refugee child was 8.2 yuan (5 yuan for food, 1 yuan for daily necessities, 50 cents for school supplies, 1 yuan for medical expenses, 50 cents for miscellaneous expenses, and 2 yuan for education). Currently, due to soaring prices, the association has slightly increased the living expenses for refugee children. (The End)</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen University Welcomes Acting President Xu Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Kunming, 31st) After the Ministry of Education announced Xu Chongqing as the acting president of Sun Yat-sen University, the students of the university expressed their great welcome. Mr. Xu has now flown to Kunming from Chongqing, and plans to go to the university within a few days to preside over school affairs.

<h3>Educational Concert to be Held at YMCA Tonight</h3>

<h3>Education Director Xu Discusses the Zhejiang Provincial Joint Examination Issue, Random Examinations for Junior High School Graduates, Sending Staff to Local Examinations for Senior High School Students</h3>
<p>(Yongkang Dispatch) Zhejiang Education Director Xu Shaodi came to Yongkang on official business. When asked by reporters whether the Zhejiang Province will follow the Ministry of Education's order to hold a joint examination for this year's middle school graduates, he replied as follows: Zhejiang Province is also included in the joint examination for middle school graduates in fifteen provinces this year, according to reports from Chongqing, but the department has not yet received a formal order. It is found that 12 high schools in Zhejiang Province will have graduating classes this semester, with a total of over 400 students. The schools are distributed in eleven counties including Yin County, Shaoxing, Sheng County, Tiantai, Xianju, Jinhua, Qu County, Qing Tian, and Lishui. 53 junior high schools, with a total of over 1100 students, are distributed in 32 counties including Xiaofeng, Yuqian, Cixi, Fenghua, Zhuji, Xinchang, Ninghai, Linhai, Dongyang, Jiangshan, Jiande, Yongjia, Chun'an, Ruian, and Songyang. Zhejiang Province is located on the front line, and transportation is extremely inconvenient, especially in the counties close to the war zone. If all students are concentrated for the joint examination, there will be many difficulties, and there will be many financial difficulties for the students. It is intended to follow the Ministry's supplementary measures: conduct random examinations for junior high schools, and send staff to local examinations for each high school. However, this method will increase the difficulties for the department itself.</p>

Prizes include toys from Kang Yuan Factory and Jishi Foreign Firm. As registrations are pouring in, it is reported that the deadline has been set for June 4th. There are not many slots left.

<h3>French Ambassador About to Travel North - Suggestion of Conciliation is Absurd - Policy Towards China Consistent and Unchanging - French Concession Well-Guarded, Security Not a Concern - American University Professor Advocates Active Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Recently, the local area has been affected by the expansion of the European war and rumors from certain parties. The general public is in a state of panic and suspicion. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the spokesperson of the French Embassy yesterday to inquire about various matters and received a sincere response. According to the spokesperson, France is a democratic country, and China is also a democratic country. The friendship between the two countries has been very close in the past. The rumor that the French Ambassador suggested conciliation is absolutely absurd.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Denies Peace with Japan</p>
<p>A United Press International dispatch from Chongqing on the 1st reported that the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently firmly denied the rumors from Rome that the Chinese ambassadors to the United Kingdom, France, and Germany had jointly suggested an early peace with Japan to join the Axis powers of the European war. The spokesperson stated that not only have Chinese ambassadors abroad not made such a suggestion, but also China's policy has not changed since the outbreak of the European war. The spokesperson believes that the news from Rome must have come from Japan, seeking to confuse the world.</p>
<p>Traveling North and Returning South, Then Proceeding to Chongqing</p>
<p>Expressing the utmost sympathy for China's current situation, the French government will by no means change its consistent policy in the past. The Nanjing organization was created by the Japanese side. The Japanese have not even recognized it. How can they recognize others? The current ambassador is in Shanghai for the summer, simply inspecting the local French diplomatic agencies' office situation as usual. He may travel to Pingjin this month or next month to visit friends. Once he returns south, he will still go to Chongqing, where the central government is located. The rumor that the French ambassador is advising President Chiang for peace is simply not credible.</p>
<p>French Concession Maintaining Neutrality</p>
<p>As for the security of the French Concession in this city, there is absolutely no cause for concern. The French defense forces and police force stationed in Shanghai can cope with any unfortunate accidents from the outside. The protection measures in various places have been strengthened recently, such as waterworks, power plants, and all public utilities. Although some bad elements and the so-called German "Fifth Column" are trying to disrupt, they will certainly not succeed. The French Concession is strictly adhering to a neutral attitude. Even the more than four hundred German residents living within the concession will be tolerated as long as they live and work in peace and do not participate in any anti-British or anti-French political activities. They will continue to be allowed to reside without interference.</p>
<p>Japan Hopes to End the China Incident</p>
<p>According to an article entitled "Japan and the Nanjing Regime" published in the June issue of the English "Oriental Affairs" magazine edited by H. G. W. Woodnead of this city, Woodnead first stated in this article that Japan's recognition of the Nanjing organization is still pending. Although Abe and many of his subordinates arrived in Ning on April 23, they did not occupy a prominent position in news reports. Therefore, a certain Japanese newspaper criticized this and stated that it earnestly hopes that the Japanese authorities will make progress in ending the "China Incident" so that Japan can freely cope with the various problems that have arisen in the war. At the same time, the Chongqing National Government continues to allocate funds to the Nanjing organization. As for the rumored Sino-Japanese negotiations and conciliation, there is no basis for it at all. Recently, someone returned here from Yu and stated that the National Government continues to implement the policy of resistance, becoming stronger as it fights, and growing stronger in terms of both economy and military affairs. Finally, Woodnead said that Japan will never launch adventurous offensives in other places, because Japan is deeply mired in large-scale military operations in China and cannot extricate itself.</p>
<p>The U.S. Should Stabilize the Far East Situation</p>
<p>Nathaniel Peffer, Professor of International Relations at Columbia University in the United States, recently contributed an article to Harper's Magazine, strongly advocating that the United States immediately take active measures to stop Japan's aggression against China. The United States should go further and implement economic sanctions against Japan. Only in this way can the escalation of the war in East Asia be eliminated. The United States has abandoned its neutrality, both ideologically and behaviorally, in the European war and has already implemented</p>
<p>Supplying Munitions</p>
<p>to Britain and France because Germany's victory in the future would be detrimental to U.S. interests. The same is true in the Far East. If Japan succeeds in controlling China, it will also be harmful to the United States. Japan currently does not dare to take advantage of the European war to plunder British and French rights and interests in China, precisely because it fears the strong attitude of the United States. When Japan has no other way, it creates a puppet organization and implements its plan to recognize the puppet organization as a "legitimate government," and then conclude a "peace treaty" with it, and then instigates the puppet organization to</p>
<p>Recover Concessions</p>
<p>and the vested interests of third countries. Therefore, the British, American, and French governments should warn Japan not to go against the tide, otherwise, they will retaliate together. Since Japan's motives for excluding foreigners' rights and interests in China are obvious, the U.S. authorities should take a pro-active stance. Moral sanctions against Japan should be expanded. If the situation requires it, raw materials for military use, such as oil, metals, machinery, and cotton, should all be</p>
<p>Banned from Exporting to Japan</p>
<p>High tariffs should also be imposed on Japanese goods imported into the United States. These measures are more than enough to prevent Japan from invading China. Over the past ten years, Japan has expanded its aggression and expanded its power in the Pacific, posing the greatest threat to the United States. At present, both Japan and the United States are working hard to strengthen their military equipment, and the situation is more tense than ever. Therefore, the United States should take active actions to stabilize the situation in the Far East, and after the British and French wars are over, unite with various countries to force Japan to stop its war of aggression and withdraw all its troops in China. At the same time, the United States should help China build the foundation of an independent country.</p>
<h3>First Day of Daylight Saving Time - Implemented Universally Throughout the City - All Agencies and Businesses Use the New Time - Those Whose Clocks Have Not Been Advanced Start Work Earlier</h3>
<p>Since the Public Concession Board and the French Concession Council announced the implementation of daylight saving time, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has notified all industries to follow suit. The foreign banks' association, the Chinese banks' association, and the money changers' guild have already implemented it starting yesterday. All receipts and payments are handled according to the new time. All markets, such as gold, foreign exchange, securities, miscellaneous grains, beans and rice, cotton cloth, yarn, and money changers, started trading according to the new time yesterday. All schools automatically started classes earlier.</p>
<p>Public Utilities</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of implementing daylight saving time. Various social undertakings related to public welfare uniformly advanced the clock by one hour. Streetcars, trolleybuses, and buses in the Public Concession and the French Concession all started running at 6:00 AM new time, which is 5:00 AM old time. The electric light company normally tests the lights at 4:00 PM every day, but now the test time is 3:00 PM old time. The business community has clearly been divided into two factions regarding this movement until yesterday. The progressives are all following the new time, while the conservatives have not moved the clock. Fortunately, there is also a standard clock for the new and old times in each place. Those who want to know the accurate new time in the future can look at the big clock at the racecourse, while for the old time, in addition to the big clock at the Jianghai Customs on the Bund, the clock on the wall of the General Post Office at the north end of North Sichuan Road has also not been advanced. According to Shanghai Post Office news, starting from June 3 this year, the office hours of the Management Bureau and various branches in this city will all be advanced by one hour, but fast clocks will not be issued.</p>
<p>Court Opening Time</p>
<p>Although the courts in the First and Second Special Districts did not uniformly advance the clock by one hour yesterday, because criminal cases are mostly prosecuted by the police, and the police escort the defendants to the court according to the new time. The police lawyers representing the prosecution also arrive at the court according to the new time. Therefore, the opening time of the criminal court of the court is one hour earlier than in the past according to the clock that has not been advanced. However, the opening time of the civil courts at all levels is still based on the old time, because the summonses issued in advance for each case still contain the old time, and the people who should be summoned do not all follow the new time. Presumably, this situation of uneven time will soon tend to be consistent. As the summer transfer period is approaching, the courts have always been accustomed to starting work one hour earlier every summer, which coincides with today's implementation of daylight saving time.</p>
<p>Curfew Time</p>
<p>Regarding the curfew time in the two concessions, starting last night, the curfew will be implemented according to the new time at 12:30 AM (i.e., 11:30 PM old time). The curfew at 1:30 AM the night before was still a temporary measure when the curfew was being changed, and it is no longer applicable last night.</p>
<p>Customs and Post Office Actually Implemented</p>
<p>The English "Great American Evening News" said that Shanghai has implemented daylight saving time since midnight. However, the big clock at the Jianghai Customs on the Bund and the big clock at the General Post Office on Sichuan Road have not changed the time as before, causing a one-hour difference from the general clocks and causing some confusion in the business district. According to Postmaster General Chapelin, he did not receive a notice about the daylight saving plan, so he followed the Jianghai Customs' method and did not change the time on the post office clock. However, Jianghai Customs and post office employees have already worked according to daylight saving time. According to Luo Fude, the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, he does not intend to change the time on the Customs clock at present, but all Customs employees work according to daylight saving time. It is said that the Customs clock must use daylight saving time, and the clock is currently one hour behind, and it cannot be blamed on the obstruction of the central government, because the Chinese and French courts in the two concessions of this city under the management of the Chinese government have all adopted daylight saving time today (1st). It is heard that the local naval authorities and the U.S. warships entering the port will also quickly comply with daylight saving time.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors of the Public Concession - Decision on Recess Period</h3>
<p>The recess period for the Board of Directors of the Public Concession this year has been set from July 25th to September 3rd.</p>

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Regime Threatens White Russians - Force Unanimous Anti-Communism - Plan to Reorganize Russian僑 Organizations - Those Who Do Not Join Will Have Their Passports Revoked - Original Russian僑 Committee Forced to Dissolve</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Japanese and puppet authorities have recently taken further control over the White Russian community in this city. The "puppet municipal government" has already dissolved the original White Russian僑民 Committee and replaced it with a White Russian from the Hongkou Huishan District as the leader to reorganize the "White Russian僑民 Organization." All members of the association must be anti-communist. This regulation has already been announced by the Russian-language RUSS newspaper under Japanese protection. The newspaper warned Russian僑 that "Russian侨 who do not join the association will have their passports revoked and will not be allowed to reside in Shanghai or enjoy the rights of citizens." This new organization will be established on the 15th of this month. The chairman of the former White Russian僑民 Committee, Mantozle, will be removed from office and replaced by Qiumeng Nage, a teacher at the current Russian Commercial School. Gosmin, the former leader of the Russian僑 Fascist Federation in Harbin, will work with Qiumeng Nage to preside over the matter.</p>
<p>Past Lessons</p>
<p>The Russian僑 community in this city is extremely surprised by this, because the anti-communist movement of White Russians led by the Japanese in Harbin, Tianjin, and Beiping has chilled them. In the aforementioned places, the Japanese have almost become dictators of the Russian僑 organizations. Under their tyranny, the Russian僑 have lost their freedom. The leaders of these Russian僑 organizations are mostly cowardly and useless people who, at the instigation of the Japanese, promote the Russian僑 to support Japan and oppose communism. In Tianjin, it is particularly appalling that Russian僑 sometimes disappear due to ideological differences. Shanghai has always been a free and safe area for Russian僑, but now it has suffered such a misfortune, and the Russian僑 cannot but feel deep worry.</p>
<p>Heavy Burden</p>
<p>According to the RUSS newspaper, the organization of the new Russian僑民 organization is roughly as follows: Chairman Qiumeng Nage, Secretary Yakoshin, Director of the Accounting Section Gosmin, Director of the Registration Section Pei Zidengnikov, Director of the Assistance Section Kechaikov. The association's address is at 405 Seward Road. In addition to being responsible for the association's affairs, Qiumou is also responsible for hosting the Russian僑 community's educational and cultural activities. The association stipulates that if a member fails to pay membership dues for three months, his membership will be immediately revoked. Membership dues are collected based on the member's monthly income. Those with a monthly income of more than 129 yuan must pay 0.05% per month. Those with more than 150 yuan must pay 1% per month. Those with more than 350 yuan must pay 1.5%. After that, for every increase of 100 yuan, an additional 1.5% of membership dues must be paid.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Tram Company Branch Temporarily Resolved</h3>
<p>Three hundred machine workers at the Tram Company's Beikaier Road branch in this city demanded a salary increase from the company. The company refused to publish the conditions proposed by the workers. Representatives from both labor and management held negotiations yesterday morning. At the same time, the workers returned to the factory to resume work. The labor dispute has been temporarily resolved.</p>
<h3>Police Department Stipulates Joint Mutual Defense Measures - Four or Five Households Can Jointly Install Alarm Bells - If One Household Has an Alarm, Neighboring Households Report to the Police Immediately</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department has stipulated the following joint mutual defense measures: (1) Shops and homes on the same street or in the same lane should be connected with hidden wires. It is most affordable to install four or five households together. (2) Each household must install an alarm bell and an indicator. The more pushbuttons installed, the better. There should also be one or two upstairs. (3) When any household presses the button, its bell will not ring, and the neighbor can call the police telephone number 15380 at this time and report to the nearby on-duty patrolman. Only with mutual cooperation between neighbors can good results be achieved. (4) Small group installations are inexpensive and can be inspected by Westerners every month. Larger organizations charge a little more because they require large indicators. (5) The police believe that if the general households in Shanghai can universally use this mutual assistance defense technology design, they will be able to make good use of the police station and deter bandits. However, the use of the alarm bell can only be limited to more serious cases. (6) The method of misusing the alarm bell must be avoided as much as possible. The pushbutton must be qualified if it has been approved and has some kind of protection and must be installed in a place where it will not be misused, but at the same time, it must be ensured that the pushbutton is not exposed and is easy to reach when used. (7) It has now been agreed with a certain machinery engineering merchant to prepare for immediate installation. The fee is 80 yuan per household for a group of five households, including the connecting line, with one pushbutton installed per household. In addition, if you install an additional pushbutton, you will be charged an additional 4 yuan. The monthly inspection fee is 5 yuan for five households. Reliable machinery industrial firms who want to know the details can see the samples at the Criminal Section of the Police Department at 185 Fuzhou Road and always register the merchant's name, address, and telephone number as a contractor. (8) After installing the alarm bell equipment, the machine engineer must report to the Criminal Section of the Police Department for registration. When a user requests installation, a list of merchant names that have been registered by the Criminal Section to request installation of equipment will be given at any time.</p>
<h3>New Method of Calculating Interest on Deposits and Overdrafts Implemented Yesterday - Abolishing the Monthly Balancing Method - Interest Calculated Based on Daily Balance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Guild, after consultation, decided to adopt a new method of calculating interest on deposits and overdrafts starting from June 1st. The banks and money shops should calculate the interest on deposits and overdrafts based on the daily balance of deposits and overdrafts, according to the deposit and overdraft interest rates. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the banking and money industries yesterday that the old habits of the two industries were to balance the gross interest on deposits and overdrafts with customers at the end of each month and then calculate the deposit and overdraft interest. If it is a deposit, it will be calculated according to the deposit interest rate. If it is an overdraft, it will be calculated according to the overdraft interest rate. The new method calculates the balance on the specified date and abolishes the monthly balancing method. For example, the deposit and overdraft interest rates announced by the guild at the end of last month were (1) 7.5 yuan for deposit interest and (2) 18 yuan for overdraft interest. After the above deposit and overdraft interest rates are implemented, it will be beneficial to the banks and money shops themselves, but it will not harm the customers, and it is said that foreign banks have already implemented this.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow is the Anti-Smoking Memorial Day - Promoting Anti-Drug Movement</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium in Humen, Guangdong, which has been designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day. People from all walks of life in this city believe that since the withdrawal of the national army, the ban on smoking has been relaxed.

They have decided to unanimously promote the anti-drug movement, eliminate the scourge of drugs, maintain public security, and protect national health.</p>
<h3>German Signal Magazine - Not Banned from Sale in the Concession - British Aviation Association Banquets French Military Commander - Allied Nationals Enthusiastically Donate to Their Motherland</h3>
<p>The other day, a certain newspaper reported that the Public Concession Police Department banned the sale of the German magazine "Signal" (Dro Signal) in the Concession. According to a statement from the Police Department, this is not the case.</p>
<p>So-Called Ban Was a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>The English "Great American Evening News" said that there was a misunderstanding regarding the news reported the other day that a German English-language magazine called "Signal" was banned from sale by the Public Concession Police Department. It turned out that when a certain newspaper reporter went to a certain bookstore on Sichuan Road, a British police officer in uniform happened to enter the store and the shop assistant was not allowed to sell "Signal" magazine again. The reporter wrote a news item about the Police Department banning the sale of "Signal" magazine.</p>
<p>Another Bookstore</p>
<p>also said that two British policemen came to the store the other day and said that "Signal" magazine was banned from sale. After speaking, they took away two copies of the magazine. The German bookstore that is the general agent for "Signal" magazine heard that the Public Works Department had replied in a letter that the department and the Police Department knew nothing about this matter and admitted that police officers had no right to base it on the ordinary people</p>
<p>Political Views</p>
<p>to ban any publications, and the police were only investigating the bookstore in an "unofficial" capacity. However, the main German僑 in this city are quite indignant about this because "Signal" magazine, although it can be regarded as a German propaganda product, cannot be regarded as an inflammatory publication. Therefore,</p>
<p>German僑 side</p>
<p>may file a formal protest on the grounds that British police officers abuse police force and have a discriminatory attitude towards German publications, and the German僑 side believes that the provocative nature of "Signal" magazine is far less than that of certain pro-Allied publications that are allowed to be sold freely.</p>
<p>British Aviation Association Banquets French Commander</p>
<p>Sir Sassoon, Chairman of the Royal British Aviation Association, to celebrate that Major Danvy, a member of the Association, was recently awarded for his operations on the Western Front in Europe, held a luncheon at the Association's HSBC Building Clubhouse on May 31, and invited senior French naval and land forces in Shanghai and Colonel Essault, the new French Army Commander. The banquet the other day can be described as a joyous gathering of the British and French joint front. Sir Sassoon also took the opportunity to welcome Major Essault to take charge of the French military defense here. The Duke expressed the Allied forces' concerted efforts to resist the war and the increasing responsibility of the Allied forces, expressing welcome to Major Essault's participation, and expressing congratulations to Member Danvy for winning the government medal. It is said that Danvy is twenty years old and used to study at the British Church School on Jiujiang Road. After graduating, he joined the Air Force. When the war suddenly broke out, Danvy immediately joined the frontline operations. Finally, Major Hsia gave a thank you speech. The Major spoke about the difficult operations of the British and French Air Forces on the front lines.</p>
<p>Italian General Association Suddenly Sold</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Italian General Association at 285 Madon Road has been sold to the Shanghai Protective Animal Association in the past few days. It is generally believed that because Italy is about to join the war, it is feared that its property in the French Concession will be confiscated due to the relationship between hostile countries, hence this sudden move.</p>
<p>French僑 in This City Pray for Victory</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily News said that the other day (May 31) was the last day of the three-day prayer. Mass was held at 9:00 AM to pray for victory for France.

<p>German Sailors Leisurely Enjoy Themselves</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the German "Fifth Column" held a meeting on the German ship Remis, which was moored in the Huangpu River. It has now been confirmed that this is not true. Since German ships were forced to moor in neutral ports after the outbreak of the European war, the sailors of the Remis felt idle and bored, so they challenged the German僑 rowing athletes in this city to a grand rowing competition yesterday near the mooring site of the Remis, near the Bund of the French Concession and the adjacent waters of Nanshi.</p>
<p>Hua Mao Hotel Cancels Band</p>
<p>As the European war has become increasingly intense, many Allied nationals in this city are practicing frugality and donating money to their motherland. For example, the French Veterans Association in Shanghai has been raising 500,000 francs of military bonds separately, which will be remitted to the home country after the full amount is raised. In addition, it is learned that the Hua Mao Hotel automatically canceled the band it had set up the other day to conform to the meaning of frugality.</p>
<h3>Six Businesses Penalized for Not Labeling Prices - Fined 15 Yuan Each</h3>
<p>Six businesses, including a certain company on Nanjing Road, Shenli Company at 190 Edward Road, Taichang Company at 133 Tongfu Road, and Tongxing Company at 20 Carter Road, were fined 15 yuan each by the Special First Court on May 31 for failing to label prices as required by the Public Works Bureau after investigation.</p>
<h3>Two U.S. Gunboats Sail to Hankou - Peyshar Sails to Yanhu - Marblehead to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the U.S. gunboats Guam and Luzon sailed out of the Huangpu River yesterday (May 31) to Hankou. Rear Admiral Hether's fast ship Issapeyre also sailed out, heading to Wuhu. The only U.S. warship currently moored in Shanghai is the flagship of the Asian Fleet, the Augusta. According to unconfirmed news, the U.S. warship Marblehead, which is moored in Manila, is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, the local naval authorities said they were not aware of the ship's arrival date.</p>
<h3>The Adjustment Association Plans to Temporarily Suspend Rice Purchases and Handle Clearance Procedures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food Adjustment Association, entrusted by various sectors, has ordered over 50,000 bags of foreign rice from the British company Jardine Matheson, totaling 19 batches as of recently. According to a visit by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, although most of the past 19 batches of foreign rice have been cleared gradually, there are quite a few cases where the clearance procedures have been delayed. As a result, each time a new batch of foreign rice arrives, the previous batch has not been completely cleared. Therefore, the association now plans to temporarily suspend ordering after the 19th batch and resume ordering after all 19 batches have been cleared.</p>
<h3>Soybean Curd Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>The movement by soybean curd shop workers in the city to increase wages began the night before last. Workers in shops in areas such as Old Zha Gate Bridge, Chenjia Bang, and Xinzha Road in the Public Concession stopped working. This extended to areas such as Eight Immortals Bridge, Taiping Bridge, and Vegetable Market Street in the French Concession. After the workers went on strike, the employers held a meeting to discuss the matter, and the result was that the workers' monthly wages were generally increased by $1.50, with the average monthly wage being $10.50, and some earning $12 per month. Currently, the labor side has proposed a wage increase of $7.50 per person, bringing the total to $18 including the original wage of $10.50. It is said that there is a large gap between the opinions of labor and management, and a solution has not yet been found. It is reported that there are over 500 soybean curd shops in the city, and employers in the Xujiahui area have already automatically increased wages, and the workers are still working as usual.</p>

<h3>Wenzhou Port Blockaded - Third-Country Ships Prohibited Indefinitely - Japanese Forces Used Force to Prevent Foreign Ships from Entering</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports: Yesterday (31st), it was learned that Wenzhou, a free port in China, has been closed by the Japanese naval authorities, and third-country ships are prohibited from entering indefinitely. Ships sailing along the coast first learned of this on May 22nd.</p>
<p>Opening Fire to Obstruct Navigation</p>
<p>On that day, the ship Argonaut attempted to enter Wenzhou, and an armed Japanese motorboat opened fire, with bullets flying over the ship's bow. Then, a Japanese officer boarded the ship and ordered it to anchor outside the port. It is reported that a British small boat attempted to pass through the Japanese blockade at night with its lights off and ran aground on a mudflat at the same time.</p>
<p>Changing Course to Other Places</p>
<p>Currently, ships sailing to Wenzhou are changing course to other places, as Japanese naval patrol boats control the area more effectively than controlling Wenzhou itself. It is customary for third-country ships sailing to Wenzhou to anchor outside the port during the day and pass through the blockade line at night.</p>
<p>Intimidation Tactics</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, the spokesperson for the Japanese Navy in Shanghai warned third-country ships that violations of port regulations had been repeatedly reported, such as ignoring Japanese Navy signals and entering the port at night with lights off. If anyone violates the rules in the future, they will suffer the serious consequences themselves.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Suspends Issuance of "Residence Permits" - Resumes Using Travel Permits</h3>
<p>The "Special District Office" established by the puppet "Municipal Government" at the old site of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce originally only handled the issuance of travel permits. However, if those who obtained permits wanted to get them on the same day, they had to spend a tip ranging from one to three yuan per permit. If they did not pay, the "staff" in charge would make things difficult for them, and it would take at least three days to obtain the permit. Although the puppet "Mayor" issued a "proclamation" at the beginning of spring canceling the service fee for obtaining permits, it was only a change from "official collection" to private extortion. When the Japanese opened Nanshi, many people who could not afford the expensive rent in the concessions moved to live there because they heard that the rent in the city was low. The "Office" set up another counter to issue "Residence Permits." The validity period of this permit was longer than that of the travel permit, and there was no fee required when receiving it. Occasionally, it could also be used as a travel permit. Therefore, in recent months, the number of requests for "Residence Permits" has increased sharply, and the sales of travel permits have decreased sharply. The income of the "staff" managing the issuance of travel permits was greatly affected, and the undercurrent between them gradually intensified. However, those in charge of travel permits had a deeper relationship with the puppet "Government." Although the other party also tried their best to lobby, the result seemed to be a failure. The part that issued residence permits has now been "ordered" to end. It is not yet known whether the residence permits in Nanshi will continue to be issued or whether another "agency" will handle them. Now, in order to show "integrity and public service," the issuing of travel permits no longer accepts tips. However, it does not guarantee "same-day pickup," and those who obtain permits must personally bring various proof documents to the "application" office. It will take three days for them to be issued. Therefore, the business of those who specialize in obtaining travel permits will be slightly affected.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Plans to Increase Freight Charges by 50% - Ningbo People in Shanghai Object - Propose Raising More Donations to Advance 500,000 Yuan - 18,000 Bags Already Ordered to Be Shipped to Ningbo by Steamer</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's letter from Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, states that the food shortage in Ningbo has reached a serious stage. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the future is worrying. However, the prices of Shanghai rice and foreign rice are very high, and it is proposed to subsidize 20 to 30 yuan per stone. Moreover, it will take three months before the new grain comes on the market. The subsidy, calculated for the four counties of Yin, Ci, Zhen, and Feng, amounts to a huge sum of 2.5 million yuan. Although the funds raised in Ningbo after all efforts were only over 300,000 yuan, it is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. Therefore, it is proposed to increase the freight charges for Shanghai-Ningbo ships to and from by 50% to compensate for this. This is a last resort, and it is also intended to take from the people and use for the people. You believe that increasing the burden on merchants is not appropriate, but Ningbo's financial resources are limited. The number of donations raised before has been exhausted, and it is impossible to raise more. If the freight charges are not increased, there is no other way. However, the food problem is so serious that it is impossible to stop it. After much deliberation, what is the best way to deal with it so that the food problem can be properly resolved? You are a veteran of the country and have a strong connection to your hometown. I hope you can provide guidance so that we can follow it. Yu replied in a letter stating that after the Ningbo Food Relief Association discussed and announced a method of drawing 5% of the value of all import and export goods, the Ningbo people in Shanghai who returned to their hometowns believed that this method of drawing profit was not appropriate and unanimously expressed their opposition. Now, it is proposed to change the name and increase the import and export freight charges by 50%. Although the name has been changed, the burden on the people is still the same. This strategy is being used when there is no way to raise funds, but there are many drawbacks. The fellow villagers' association has repeatedly discussed it and unanimously agreed that the fellow villagers in Shanghai should try to raise donations, divided into two steps. The first step is to raise 1 million yuan, with Ningbo and Shanghai each bearing half. The second step is to raise another 1 million yuan. Since Ningbo is in difficulty, Shanghai is willing to bear more of the responsibility. In any case, they do not want to increase the burden on the people in order to stabilize grain prices. Because the people cannot make a living, stabilizing grain prices is done to provide relief. The burden of taxes and fees is still on the common people, and the impact is widespread throughout the entire country. Therefore, it was decided not to express support. As for the fact that Ningbo only raised 300,000 yuan, in my opinion, it seems that the amount can be increased. It is not yet exhausted, because many people have made a fortune during this period of national crisis. It is okay to contribute from the conscience. Currently, the reason why the price of rice in Shanghai has risen is that there are one or two hundred thousand bags of newly arrived rice that have not yet been reported to customs. Rice merchants are hoarding and raising prices. Therefore, the price of re-exportable rice has been shouted up to 62-3 yuan per bag, while the price of rice in this street is only 55 yuan per bag, and there are few buyers. This is because Shanghai-Ningbo ships are restricted from loading rice for direct import. Each shipping company is rushing to handle more than 10,000 bags of re-export rice, regardless of the price, thus raising the price. I had to purchase it from Hong Kong, and the price was 3-4 yuan cheaper per bag than in Saigon. I first handled 20,000 bags to be transported to Ningbo, and I urgently raised cash to purchase Hong Kong dollars. Originally, I planned to load all 1 million yuan of the funds approved by the Ministry of Finance under the name of the Sanbei Stabilization Association in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, only 500,000 yuan was used for the flat rice project loaded on the Moufu ship, and the rest was used for other purposes. I asked my brother to advance the money. If there is extra money, it is okay, but because my brother has already advanced 1.5 million yuan under the name of the Sanbei Stabilization Association, all of which is borrowed from private property, I really have no ability to borrow more. Secondly, the arbitrage in the Shanghai market is more than 4%, and the discount for remittances is 120-30 yuan. With such high interest rates, who is willing to borrow? Because the Ningbo remittance is huge and the rice payment is urgent, I am afraid that you have no cash to load. I am willing to lend you 500,000 yuan from the Sanbei rice payment stored in the Bank of China in Ningbo to load in Shanghai. Later, I received a telegram from my brother Dalie saying that 400,000 yuan had been used to repay the previous rice payment. It was found that the rice loaded by the ships was not for relief, but because Ningbo restricted ships from entering with rice, we stopped sailing. With this restriction, the shipping companies are rushing to handle it for business purposes. Although the money must be repaid, it is okay to delay it slightly. After the event, I heard that the Moufu ship had 1,000 bags that had not been loaded, but the payment had already been received. If this is true, it is even more shocking. Now, in the midst of helplessness, Shanghai has raised more than 500,000 yuan, plus 500,000 yuan from Ningbo, to first handle 18,000 bags, which will soon be loaded on the Glen ship and sent directly from Hong Kong to Ningbo for preliminary relief. Subsequent processing must be done with cash on hand, and donations cannot be collected all at once, so there is only one way to borrow and advance. In addition, the opinions of the gentlemen from the Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Association are to first handle 50,000 bags, totaling more than 60,000 stones, and prepare to lose 20 yuan per bag, totaling 1 million yuan. The second step is to handle another 50,000 bags and raise another 1 million yuan, for a total loss of 2 million yuan, which is enough for relief. As for the price, it is proposed to be 30 yuan per stone, that is, 5 pounds of rice per yuan, which will be announced accordingly.</p>
<h3>Before the Heat of Summer Has Arrived - Cholera Discovered - Two Patients - One Has Died</h3>
<p>True cholera has occurred in Shanghai and has been confirmed by the Health Department. The health of all residents of Shanghai has been seriously threatened. A reporter from Datong News Agency has recorded the following information:</p>
<p>True Cholera Discovered in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, true cholera has not been prevalent in Shanghai for many years. This disease spreads extremely quickly and is absolutely valued by the medical community in all countries. This year, it has broken out in Shanghai when the weather is not very hot, which is enough to cause anxiety.</p>
<p>Two Infected - Name Investigation</p>
<p>The place where this disease was discovered is the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road. Two people have been infected with this serious infectious disease. Their names are as follows: (1) Pan Xu, from Shaoxing, 41 years old, residing at 41 Tianxiang Lane, Du Shenfu Road, French Concession. (2) Ma Zhang, from Shaoxing, 32 years old, residing at 35 Qiyu Lane, Minti Niyin Road, French Concession.</p>
<p>One Died - One Saved</p>
<p>The former of the two listed above was admitted to the hospital on the 24th of last month, and the latter was admitted to the hospital on the 28th. The director of the hospital, Deng Qingshan, sent the feces of the two to the Health Department of the Public Works Department for examination and confirmation, which was confirmed to be true cholera. Of the two, the former has died, and the latter is being treated by the hospital. The progress is still good.</p>
<h3>Selling Red Pills - Two Offenders Each Sentenced to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Huang Yufu, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, learned that someone was secretly transporting red pill drugs inside the house at 17, Lane 390, Qiwupu Road. He, together with Western detective Hui Tuo, went to arrest Jin Shifu, a man from Haimen, at around 11:00 PM the night before last. 23 bags of red pills were seized, each bag containing 1,000 pills, totaling 23,000 pills, all produced by Longma Foreign Company. According to Jin's confession, this batch of red pills was sent by a Chinese and two Japanese and transferred to Wang Zhangzhang, a man from Haimen. Wang was about to arrive, etc. Chinese and Western detectives waited in the room. After a while, Wang did arrive and was arrested together. In the police car, Wang wanted to bribe the Chinese detective with 200 yuan. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Dayin, a lawyer from the police station, prosecuted them in accordance with the anti-drug regulations. After questioning the defendants, their confessions were evasive. After questioning by Judge Xiao Peishen, Jin Shifu and Wang Zhangzhang were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly intending to sell and possess poisonous substances. The drugs were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Jinglun Silk Weaving Factory - Receives Threatening Letter - Attached with a Hand Grenade</h3>
<p>The Jinglun Silk Weaving Factory at 15, Lane 1, Xiaoshadu Road, Singapore Road, West Shanghai, whose distribution office is located at 16, Lane 520, Ningbo Road, suddenly had someone bring a letter to the factory at around 12:00 PM the night before last, with a hand grenade attached. The factory workers planned to question the person, but the person had already left quickly. The contents of the letter were threatening words. It was reported to the police station for the record.</p>
<h3>Tenants in Xicheng Lane, French Concession - Oppose Rent Increase - Have Sent Representatives to Negotiate Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The houses in Xicheng Lane, Malong Road, French Concession, are the property of Sun Chuanfang, the former commander-in-chief of the Five Provinces Allied Forces. The family members of Sun entrusted the Trust Department of the Shanghai Continental Bank to collect the rent. In May of this year, the tenants in the lane received a notice from the management department stating that rents had been increased everywhere recently, but this lane would remain the same. Due to the increase in land tax, water, and electricity, rents would be increased by 30% across the board from July 1st based on the original rent amount. After receiving the notice, the tenants were all anxious. They thought that the rent in the lane was already relatively expensive, and the tap water was a self-flowing well system, and the water quality was turbid and unsanitary. Now, instead of improving it, they had to increase the rent, which was really difficult to bear. They specially convened a meeting of all tenants last night to discuss countermeasures. The following was resolved: (1) Unanimously oppose the rent increase. (2) Elect Yao Xing, Xu Menglin, Tang Zuxiang, Shen You, and eleven others as representatives to send a letter to the owner to negotiate a withdrawal. (3) The rent from July will still be paid according to the original amount. If the owner refuses to accept it, it will be deposited in the bank for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Driver's Negligence Causes Death - Appeals Against Original Judgment</h3>
<p>Peng Chaohua, a man from Yancheng, 35 years old this year, works as a driver for Pelli Ai (transliteration), a French tram company boss. At 12:20 PM on April 9th, he was driving his owner's private car No. 2700 through the intersection of Luban Road and Ximen Road. The driver was careless and knocked down Zhou Zuomin, a 12-year-old local primary school student at Fuchun Primary School (residing at 24 Xinmin Village, Malong Road, the only son of Zhou Esheng, the current accounting director of the Jiangxi Dayu China Resources Committee, and the heir of three families). He was crushed in the head and died. The police station arrested Peng and sent him to the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted for negligent homicide in the course of business. Zhou Zhou, the victim's mother, also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, seeking damages of 17,280 yuan, which was calculated based on the goal of cultivating the deceased to study until graduation from university and find a livelihood. At the first trial, Judge Miao Qingbang ruled that the parts of the car driven by the defendant were damaged and had been verified by the Vehicle Inspection Office of the Public Works Department. He should bear the corresponding responsibility. He therefore sentenced Peng Chaohua to one year of imprisonment for causing death due to business negligence, and the incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Because Peng Chaohua did not accept the judgment, he hired lawyers Ba He (transliteration) and Huang Mingmin to present reasons and appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court tried the case. The appellant made a statement in the detention center, stating the reasons for the appeal and the circumstances of the accident. The lawyer representing the incidental civil suit also appeared in court to state his opinions and reasons for claiming damages. The court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date, and the appellant was still remanded to custody.</p>
<h3>Affected by the European War - Commodity Prices in Shanghai Gradually Stabilize</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in Shanghai have gradually stabilized due to the European War. However, many of the commodity prices in various industries that have risen several times in the past still maintain their highest prices. The New New Company on Nanjing Road has always been known for its unique low profit. When commodity prices in various industries in Shanghai rose, the company set prices lower than the general market price in order to reduce the burden on customers. The recent summer special price campaign has made even more significant progress. This has left a very good impression on the community. The abnormal prosperity of Shanghai has reached its peak. At this time of high-pressure and difficult life for citizens, it is hoped that the business community will automatically correct the level of suppressing commodity prices.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Merchants Stir Up Trouble Again, Fabricating Various Stories to Deceive People, Aiming to Profit by Exploitation</h3>
<p>Shanghai rice merchants are once again exploiting the situation, taking advantage of the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang to stir up unrest in Shanghai, manipulate Shanghai's rice prices, acting with a malice more venomous than snakes. The rumors they spread include: (1) Claims of a shortage of imported rice, stating that assigned quotas are low and Shanghai's reserves are not abundant, only about 700,000 bags. These figures come from the rice merchants and can be inflated or deflated at will, rendering them unreliable. Regarding rice reserves, the concession authorities refuse to take responsibility for conducting on-site investigations, simply relying on the merchants' reports, which is a significant oversight. As for whether imports will continue, it is not public information, so how can anyone know the truth? Merchants wanting prices to fall can say large shipments are arriving; merchants wanting prices to rise can say no shipments are scheduled. Everything comes from the mouths of the rice merchants; how can it be trusted? (2) Fabricating claims of drought preventing rice planting. This is even more reprehensible. The plum rain season is still after the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Grain in Ear solar term has not yet arrived. How can they know there will be no plum rains? Even if there are no plum rains, the impact will be minor, mainly affecting higher-altitude areas in Zhejiang Province. Major rice-producing areas usually have a network of rivers and canals. Even without rain, it would only require more labor; it would not prevent rice planting. Therefore, these pretexts are concocted because rice merchants fear rice prices will not be high enough, and they fear lacking excuses to manipulate the market, in order to stir up public anxiety and forcibly raise rice prices. The concession authorities should not continue to allow these unscrupulous merchants to harm the people's food supply. Furthermore, the rice panic in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other areas in Zhejiang Province is prompting daily procurement and relief efforts. The Chaoshan and Xiamen merchants from Guangdong, as well as the Nanxun, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas along the Sujia Road, are successively increasing their purchases, drastically expanding the sales channels, causing all types of rice prices to rise higher and higher.</p>
<p>Yesterday, imported rice became even more popular. Merchants from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other inland areas continued to purchase without hesitation. Ningbo merchants also made purchases. Due to insufficient supply of domestic rice, demand was strong, compounded by speculation from both industry insiders and outsiders, and the merchants hoarding goods to drive up prices, the market saw prices soar. Small polished rice rose from 49.78 yuan to 50.056 yuan in the morning and then surged to 51.3 yuan in the afternoon. No. 2 Saigon and Fire Grain both soared to 52 yuan, and No. 1 New Saigon also surged to 53 yuan, rising about one yuan in the morning compared to the previous market and continuing to rise 56 jiao in the afternoon. Small polished rice in original packaging also surged to 61 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice was priced at 61 yuan but lacked buyers. New orders were being negotiated at around 57 yuan, and it is rumored that some deals have been finalized. However, due to concerns about the safety of ships, both rice merchants and foreign firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Domestic rice, including thick and thin Japonica rice, are also in the same situation. Rumors of off-market deals are spreading, all for actual sales, with prices rising across the board. Changbang Qing Te Geng (Special Japonica rice) was trading at 56-57 yuan, Fen Geng (Powder Japonica rice) at 54 yuan, Changkun Geng Te (Special Changkun Japonica rice) from 54 yuan, and the next grade at 52-53 yuan. Qingsi Te Bo (Special Thin Qingsi rice) was 55-56 yuan, Da Shi (Big Market) at 53-54 yuan, and the next grade at 51-52 yuan. Nangang early rice was 51-52 yuan, and the price per dan was 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of glutinous rice is also limited, the sales market is not as broad as other grains, causing prices to rise only half a yuan to nearly a yuan, following Japonica and Tip rice. Jinli Special Yuan was selling for 46 yuan, Changdan Bai Yuan (White Yuan from Changzhou and Danyang) was 44-45 yuan, and the next grade was 42-43 yuan. Jiangbei Bai Yuan (White Yuan from Jiangbei), which had previously been sold at lower prices and has a firmer texture, is quite popular inland, resulting in brisk sales. Therefore, the selling price increased by more than one yuan, opening at 42.5 to 42 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Merchants Begin Manipulating the Market Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was not very active, and the market felt tight. Recently, merchants from both northern and southern provinces have shown signs of activity. Inland areas such as Zhejiang and Ningbo are also experiencing rice shortages, so flour sales are not weak. Therefore, factories have been quietly raising prices for customers, with rumors of prices as high as 13.6 yuan, but not on the open market. As for the wholesale price of No. 2 flour on the street, it remained at the original price of 13.8 yuan, but it is feared that it will also increase soon. Inland flour, such as Shunfeng brand, also rose to 13.89 yuan. As rice prices have been rising for several days, commodity prices are also expected to rise. It was found that 100 bags of Gang flour were shipped to Shantou today.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Continues to Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial markets for British and American exchange continued to soften. This was because the demand from foreign banks increased sharply, leading to a shortage of funds. In the past two days, speculators have not been buying heavily, but they have not been selling either. In the early morning, the exchange rate suddenly rebounded, leading to a flat British rate and a softer American rate. Subsequently, British banks aggressively absorbed shillings and American dollars, reportedly purchased on behalf of the Exchange Equalization Committee. Then, American banks followed suit, further tightening prices. The American exchange rate reached 5.375 yuan, and the British exchange rate reached 4 pence 0.3125. Around 10:30, foreign banks were both buying and selling, keeping supply and demand relatively balanced, and the trend stabilized. Before the close, there was a slight rebound. As a result, the British exchange rate was 4 pence 0.46875, and the American exchange rate was 5.4375 yuan, both tighter by 0.09375 compared to the previous day. Futures contracts tightened only slightly, aligning with the spot market.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Eager to Buy</p>
<p>In the early morning, London telegraphic transfer rates for both near and far terms fell by 1.875, New York silver prices fell slightly, and London gold remained stable. Exchange rates for British against American, Shanghai, French, and other currencies were flat. American against British increased by 0.375, against Shanghai by 0.05, and against Shanghai by 0.01875. The Central Bank's listed rates remained the same. In the morning, banks opened spot selling rates with British exchange at 4 pence 1.40625 and American exchange at 5.5625 yuan, which was flat for British and tighter by 0.03125 for American compared to the previous evening's close. This was due to the sudden rebound in the exchange rate. After the opening, British banks were eager to buy, causing prices to soften slightly. It was estimated that foreign banks bought shillings at 4 pence 1.125 and also bought American dollars from American banks at a price of 5.5 yuan to 4.4375 yuan. It was rumored that the above positions were purchased on behalf of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. HSBC's listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced, reducing it by 0.01%. Later, Chase also came to absorb, and at that time, foreign banks had very little intention to supply. Chinese banks had sold shillings to Chase, tightening the rate to 4 pence 0.3125. The American exchange rate also softened to 5.375 yuan. After 11:00, although Olyphant and others were buying, Sassoon, the Japanese Bank, and others were selling, keeping the market stable. June shilling contracts were traded with American banks buying from Sassoon at 3 pence 8.6875, and June American exchange was sold by Zhengjin to Olyphant and Jardine Matheson at 5.28125 yuan. Transactions cleared up slightly before the noon close. Only speculators saw the price return to a low level and bought June American dollars at 5.5 yuan from Chinese banks. The closing results were British exchange at 4 pence 0.46875, American exchange at 5.4375 yuan, June British exchange at 3 pence 9.6875, and June American exchange at 5.28125 yuan. Compared to yesterday's closing price, spot British and American exchange both tightened by 0.09375, June contracts tightened by 0.03125, and American exchange softened by 0.015625. There was no afternoon market on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong: American Exchange Soft, British Exchange Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Both British and Shanghai exchange rates were unchanged. Spot American exchange softened by 0.1875, to 20.125 yuan. Spot Japanese exchange strengthened by one yuan, to 85 yuan. At 10:10 AM, spot Shanghai exchange rose by four yuan, to 366 yuan. It closed flat at 11:30 AM, with spot Shanghai exchange rising by one yuan, to 367 yuan. All other rates remained unchanged. There was no afternoon market on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin: British Exchange Slightly Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, 1st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British exchange tightened by 0.03125, to 3 pence 6.525. Spot American and Shanghai exchange rates remained unchanged. The unofficial market for "Joint Notes" softened by one jiao, to 100.025 yuan.</p>
<h3>Interest on Funds Transferred Via Draft in May: 7.5 Yuan per 1000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has set the interest rate for interbank funds transferred via draft in May at 7.5 yuan per 1000 yuan (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7.5%).</p>
<h3>Gold Price Exceeds 6000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash "cooked gold" (smelted gold) rose sharply, exceeding the 6000 yuan mark again. The reasons for the firm high prices are the increase in demand and the addition of leverage by large investors, as well as the slow softening of foreign exchange, which made people apprehensive. The bullish sentiment was not influenced by current domestic or international news. Trading was quite active in the first half of the day. The opening price was 5930 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, it was heard that money exchangers were aggressively buying, and the price soon rose to 5980 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was also reported tight, and a certain gold firm intermittently sold, in large quantities, slightly suppressing the upward trend. It had fallen back to 5955 yuan. As the exchange market softened, securities firms made large profits, and gold firms also came back to buy, creating a large buying frenzy. The highest price broke the 6000 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6070 yuan. However, as foreign exchange rebounded slightly before noon, and retail investors and banks offered their profits, it fell back to 6010 yuan. The closing result was 6025 yuan, an increase of 75 yuan compared to the previous evening's close. The number of transactions in half a day was two thousand taels. Jewelry gold was raised by ten yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Cooked Gold Rises by 75 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the mood was slightly fatigued, down a small 20 yuan per bar (10 taels). Jewelry shops sold to banks at 5930 yuan. Later, money exchangers and securities firms mutually absorbed, immediately pulling up 50 yuan, with banks mutually transacting at 5980 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm forcefully sold more than 200 taels, and a certain jewelry shop followed suit, plummeting 25 yuan. A gold firm bought 20 taels from banks, and securities firms bought 30 taels from jewelry shops, all at 5955 yuan. At that time, a certain jewelry shop, on behalf of its guild, bought more than 100 taels at a limit price of 6000 yuan, and the market sentiment was firm and stable. Soon after, the foreign exchange market softened, buying intensified, gold firms, securities firms, banks, and retail investors competed to buy aggressively. Retail investors also followed, and for a time, the situation was extremely brisk. Before long, it jumped more than 100 yuan, with banks buying 90 taels from their peers at 6070 yuan. After that, the exchange market rebounded, the number of buyers gradually decreased, and a certain money exchanger returned to offer, retail investors also exited to take profits, falling back to 6000 yuan. Banks did 30 taels at 6010 yuan. At noon, banks came to buy again, raising it another 15 yuan, with banks buying 20 taels from gold firms at 6025 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was 75 yuan higher than the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 140 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the current brand gold of cash gold firms is ten-odd yuan higher than cooked gold, and the buying price is 30 yuan lower. The current bid gold is fifty-odd yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Up 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael was still 610 yuan by the Datong Association. At 10:30, it was raised by 10 yuan. After that, there was no change. As a result, the Datong Association changed the price to 620 yuan. The new association has the same price as the previous one, and the buying price is reduced by about 25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign currencies saw "cooked gold" continuing to rise under the purchases by Hong Kong firms. British gold pounds followed suit and continued to rise. Due to the Equalization Committee dumping foreign exchange in the black market, there was a strong demand for British and American gold notes. American notes had been as high as 18.45 yuan but ended at 18.28 yuan, still up 0.23 yuan from yesterday. British gold notes were also up 0.15 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose with the trend of Shanghai-Hong Kong exchange rates. French notes had a slight demand, and the market price rose slightly. Canadian and Philippine notes also had demand, and the market prices rose across the board. The supply of Japanese gold notes remained strong, retreating to 1.13 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, remaining at 0.96 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Returns to 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for fund transfer notes decreased again. The initial discount rate was 123 yuan per 1000 yuan for buying and 128 yuan for selling. The lowest discount was 120 yuan. At noon, it was around 122 yuan. In the afternoon, it was flat, down 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for money exchangers was quoted at 0.25 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities: New Buyers of Domestic Debt Gradually Show Interest, Foreign Debt Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market continued to strengthen, but trading was still very quiet in the morning. In the afternoon, there were slight new buyers transactions. The prospects for the money market were generally considered to be gradually loosening, so bullish investors still had some interest in buying even on Saturday afternoon. The news remained dull, but international changes were not far off. Both buyers and sellers were waiting for future developments to determine their direction. Yesterday's trading volume was less than 100,000 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, due to slight demand from Xie Da, Xin Chang, Wu Yuan, and other firms, and limited supply from Yi Tai, Hong Da, and Yi Chang, the market strengthened again. Type W reached 50 yuan. As a result, market prices continued to improve by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 300,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions included 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Public Co. stock at a price of 43 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 31st (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt weakened again. Senior British-German Reconstruction (British issued), Sino-French, American, and British-Behind (British issued) all fell by £2. Previous types were £43, and the latter type was £24. British-French Indemnity (British issued) fell by £1, to £44. Junior Bei Ning Railway fell by £2, to £56. Guangdong-Kowloon Railway fell by £1, to £8. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 31st (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks remained stable. Only Guthrie Rubber Estates fell by 7.5 pence, to 16 shillings and 3 pence. The rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bonds Redeemed by Lottery</h3>
<p>The 7% Public Bonds for Reconstruction of Disaster Areas in the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Republic of China, 21st year, 15th lottery redemption, was held on May 31st. Numbers 22 and 93 were drawn. The winning numbers and the 15th phase good tickets are scheduled to be paid by HSBC Bank in this city on June 15th, with a term of six years, after which they will be invalid.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Exchange Rate Tightens, Cotton Yarn Buying Resumes</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with a slight upward trend. This is because the end of the month has passed, and operators have more financial flexibility. At the same time, the exchange rate has tightened, boosting confidence, so the market has shown a significant recovery. However, actual transactions have not fully developed.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn this morning was high due to the rise in gold in the afternoon of the previous day, and market sentiment was tight. However, there were very few new buyers. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1310 yuan, falling to 1285 yuan. It was later heard that the exchange rate tightened again, and buying resumed, reaching 1330 yuan. The closing price fell back slightly by 10 yuan. The statistics for transactions in half a day showed 1540 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse increased by 30 yuan. Today, 605 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The quantities purchased by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 330 bales Fuzhou: 40 bales</p>
<p>Same Trade: 1,160 bales Xiamen: 10 bales</p>
<p>Total: 1,540 bales</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Wait and See, Cotton Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Trading in raw cotton remains lackluster, but there are occasional sales among traders. As for manufacturers, Japanese mills have shown no activity, so there is not much buying or selling on the market. The situation remains deadlocked. The current transactions for raw cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 243.00 yuan Bought by traders: 100 bales</p>
<p>Kang Jiang Hua: 204.00 yuan Bought by traders: 100 bales</p>
<p>Du Li La: 207.00 yuan Bought by traders: 200 bales</p>
<p>News from the foreign cotton market: The New York cotton market opened smoothly in the morning. Later, due to selling pressure, cotton prices declined. Then, due to good weather forecasts in the western cotton regions and the selling of near-term contracts by some spot traders, the market weakened. As a result, closing prices were down 20 points for near-term contracts and down more than 10 points for distant contracts. The Indian market was quiet, with forecasts of a rise of one rupee.</p>
<p>Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai were very quiet. All parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is quite stagnant. However, there is not much spot available in the market, so selling prices are initially very firm. Tianjin merchants' interest has gradually increased, and there will be a turning point for raw cotton in the coming days. The following are the futures prices converted to delivered-to-factory prices at an exchange rate of 5.5 yuan for American dollars:</p>
<p>20-count: American Middling: 302.90 yuan</p>
<p>Also: Lower Grade: 294.00 yuan</p>
<p>32-count: American Middling: 321.80 yuan</p>
<p>Also: Lower Grade: 312.00 yuan</p>
<p>42-count: American Middling: 325.50 yuan</p>
<p>Also: Lower Grade: 314.50 yuan</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Broad Beans Down 0.5 Yuan, Japanese Oil Mills Buy Soybeans</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for new green broad beans from Minhang was traded outside the official market, so it is not considered the official market price. It was heard that there were only thirty-odd bags, priced at 19 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous price. The official market price is not as low as this. For soybeans, in addition to a small number being bought by traders on this street, the remaining three-quarters were bought by Japanese oil mills. Because soybean cake has a lively sales market and prices are heading for a peak, the market has a squeezed situation, so the sales of soybeans have expanded further. However, supply cannot meet demand, and the overall trend is upward. Yesterday, a carload of Bengbu soybeans opened at 24.5 yuan, a carload of Chuzhou soybeans at 23 yuan, more than 400 bags of Anqing soybeans at 24.5-24 yuan, more than 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans at 23.2-23 yuan, a carload of Mingguang soybeans at 24.2 yuan, as well as 100 bags of Pinghu mottled beans, more than 40 bags of Taicang black beans, 300 bags of Chongming yellow beans, and more than 700 bags of Jiangbei green beans.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes: Japanese Controlled New Rapeseed, Soybean Oil Up Another 3 Yuan, Soybean Cake Price Surge Still Fierce</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil: Recently, due to Japanese merchants controlling and buying new rapeseed from inland areas, soybean oil is cheaper than rapeseed oil, so it has attracted purchases from all parties. The general manipulation has gained an opportunity to monopolize, and prices have frequently risen. Yesterday, under good conditions, the market jumped up another 3 yuan. It is estimated that more than 400 barrels and more than 300 baskets of various oils were transacted. Also, 80 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Shantou today.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: The price surge is fierce. In addition to Dayouyu Factory maintaining its position and not opening, other factories operated by Japanese merchants are still selling. It is estimated that oil and other traders bought 3,000 pieces of Xingji cake from the Pudong factory of the same surname, and they ordered 3,000 pieces to be delivered in June. Inland areas ordered 4,000 pieces of Kunshan Housheng Factory brand cake. Market prices are detailed in the market price column.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Wuxi Cocoon Prices Chaotic, Cocoon Merchants Mostly Dumping and Accepting Recklessly</h3>
<p>In Wuxi City and rural areas, the cocoon merchants are mostly controlled by the "Joint Company". The remaining Shanghai-Wuxi silk factories and small local silk factories have also opened to collect cocoons. Due to the restrictions on cocoon merchants this year, there is no freedom as in the past. Only one or two simple stoves are required to open a business, hang up a scale, and collect goods. Therefore, after the cocoon merchants opened the scales the day before yesterday, cocoon prices were extremely chaotic. The Silk Cocoon Association limited the price to 250 yuan per dan (yesterday's mistaken price of 350 yuan), but in order to compete for purchases, some merchants opened the scales with prices exceeding the limit by more than 50%. This chaotic situation, on the one hand, was caused by competitive bidding driving up prices, and on the other hand, by middlemen reselling fraudulently. Legitimate cocoon merchants are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, with purchase prices generally capped at 300 yuan. Impoverished breeders are willing to sell cheaply. Cocoon merchants also need to consider the exchange rate for the silk market. Due to the obstruction of silk sales by the European War, the future of silk cocoons is bleak. If the price exceeds 300 yuan per dan, there may be losses.</p>
<p>Also, 20 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong today, and five bales of silk were shipped to London. Another bale was shipped to Saigon.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Stockpilers Already Have Concerns, Cloth Market Gradually Enters the Right Track</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The cloth market is stable. Because cloth prices have fallen by about one-third from the highest prices, it is quite cost-effective for merchants to purchase. However, because actual sales are still in a quiet period, and those inside and outside the industry who have been stockpiling in the past are now facing heavy losses, they are wary. Therefore, market prices do not fluctuate much and are gradually entering the right track. Yesterday's selling prices for various cloths fluctuated in the range of 0.25-0.5 yuan. Demand from the Zhejiang route was better. Wenzhou merchants continued to purchase 100-odd pieces of fine cloth, twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Ningbo merchants purchased nearly 100 pieces. Guangdong merchants purchased 100-odd pieces of colored cloth and other goods. Retail sales in this street and wholesale business in inland areas have slightly improved, with transactions of 200-odd pieces of greige, colored cloth, coarse cloth, and other goods.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Although trading is light, market prices are rising firmly. Longtou (Dragon Head) fine cloth opened this morning at 40.05 yuan per bolt, and Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge at 1.085 yuan per yard. The market trend continued to improve, with Longtou fine cloth quoted at 41.5 yuan and serge around 1.1 yuan, but there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 220 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 105 pieces were shipped to Turkey, and 45 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Woolen Fabric Market Over the Past Month</h3>
<p>Since the dramatic change in foreign exchange rates on the 2nd of last month, the intensity of the price surge in the woolen fabric market has been unprecedented in recent years. Although exchange rates have since softened, prices remain firm as before. This is because of the European War, making it difficult to receive shipments. Here is a detailed survey of woolen fabric market prices over the past month:</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Up 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to rise due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The association's quoted price for spot 14 coarse white sugar, foreign warehouse goods, was 72 yuan to 71.5 yuan in the morning, then 71.8-71.9 yuan. It softened slightly in the afternoon, to 71.8-71.5 yuan, up 0.7 yuan. Transit goods initially rose by 1 yuan, to 58.5 yuan, then to 58-57.9 yuan, and 58-57.5 yuan in the afternoon, with no change. Taikoo refined white B mark rose from 82.5 yuan to 83 yuan, up 2 yuan from before. H mark red refined sugar was 59 yuan, up 1 yuan. Dutch red sugar remained at 61 yuan. Xinghua merchants offered 60 bags of Xinghua Qinggao (Green High) domestic sugar at 65 yuan, down a small 2-3 yuan from before. The rest had few transactions.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Native Nails Smaller and Smaller</h3>
<p>Transactions in nails from local factories have been very stagnant recently. Foreign merchants rarely purchase, and local sales have also been quiet, resulting in a sluggish market and low morale. A recent survey of the output from factories shows no reduction, so the market is full of goods, with supply greatly exceeding demand. Therefore, standard market prices are getting smaller and smaller. It was heard that yesterday's market quote was only 70 yuan per barrel of Basei nails, but secretly, 68-69 yuan could also be sold.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Lian Yuan (桂圓, Dried Longan) Price Reportedly Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the lack of continuous arrivals of dried longan pulp from Xiamen, Tong'an and other places, the market stock is depleted, and the price has become tight. Yesterday, it was heard that a Hong Kong firm released a batch of Lianzhou dried longan pulp, with a price reaching 176 yuan. The market price has also tightened accordingly, but old stock is said to be relatively cheaper.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Weekly Supplement</p>
<h3>The First Stage of the Western Front War</h3>
<p>Since August of last year, Hitler has repeatedly decided to revise his basic strategy. His first plan was to have another Munich, conquering Poland without a fight. This plan failed because Poland decided to fight. His second plan was to threaten Britain and France to abandon their policy of guaranteeing Poland, so that the invasion of Poland would be reduced to a local war. The conclusion of the German-Soviet agreement served this purpose. This threat did not work.</p>
<p>His third plan was to conquer Poland in one fell swoop, and then negotiate peace with Britain and France. This plan gave Britain and France ample time to mobilize. Once the war had begun, there was no easy way for Britain and France to make peace with Germany, otherwise, Hitler's military strength would not be damaged, and Britain and France would remobilize, which would be tantamount to military suicide.</p>
<p>Hitler's fourth plan was to wage war against Britain with minimal expenditure, using submarines, magnetic mines, and a few aircraft to attack British shipping. At the same time, he would strive to enrich the economic rear, wait for an opportunity to strike, and quietly wait for the decline, war-weariness, and erosion of combat strength of the democracies. Even if this was not enough to force Britain and France to stop the war, it would be enough to make them impatient and take risks.</p>
<p>As for the basic strategy of Britain and France, it was to intensify the blockade, forcing Hitler to choose between suffocating to death or launching a major offensive. This strategy had two major factors. First, no matter how strict the blockade, Germany must be forced to consume a large amount of its stockpiled raw materials, so that it cannot replenish them, in order to weaken its military strength. This requires intensifying operations and accelerating the rate of consumption to achieve the greatest effect. Therefore, as long as Britain and France avoid a complete defeat, they should disregard local gains and losses, forcing Germany to wage a large-scale war until its economic weaknesses become the key to victory or defeat. At that time, the blockade will become the decisive weapon.</p>
<p>Second, Hitler's ability to make all of Europe a world of terror lies in his strength. Britain and France must use great courage and great sacrifice to risk a battle with this strength, in order to call on the countries of Europe to get rid of their fear and unite to overthrow Hitler. Britain and France have allies everywhere. But Britain and France must pay a very high price to obtain their assistance.</p>
<p>Hitler has launched a general offensive on the Western Front, and in less than twenty days he has reached the English Channel. This is similar to the situation in the first phase of the last European war, the so-called "race to the sea." The tactics he used, the so-called Blitzkrieg, first used large numbers of low-flying aircraft to destroy enemy positions, replacing the artillery bombardment used in the last European war. Then, large formations of heavy tanks, covered by large formations of light tanks, concentrated on one point and launched a fierce attack. Sometimes, paratroopers were dropped simultaneously behind enemy lines, using machine guns to strafe the defending troops.</p>
<p>Heavy tank formations move more slowly and consume more gasoline. After the initial charge, they must fall behind. At this time, the light tank formations overtake and cover the advance as much as possible, engaging in reconnaissance work. If they encounter significant resistance, they must wait for the heavy tank formations to come forward and attack. After the light tank formations, motorized units followed, and infantry brought up the rear to occupy the positions.</p>
<p>During the initial charge, tank formations often maintain close contact with large air force units. Thereafter, the contact is not so close, but if the tank advance is blocked by tank defense positions, the tank formation immediately reports to the bomber units to come to help. With as many as 1,200 tanks used, the offensive is naturally unstoppable, and although the Allied forces fought bravely, they were unable to reverse the decline.</p>
<p>It may be said that Hitler's general offensive was not out of his own volition, but because domestic raw materials were being consumed more and more, making it difficult to get through the winter. At the same time, he feared that the strength of Britain and France would become stronger and stronger day by day. Forced by circumstances, he made a desperate gamble. But judging from the results at the current stage, although Britain and France can be said to have gained an advantage in military strategy, Hitler has gained a victory in tactics.</p>
<p>A Study of European War Place Names</p>
<p>Since the Western Front war has become tight, the advance and retreat of the various armies has been rapid, and the general public has suffered from the unevenness of the place names translated by the various news agencies. This publication will then make a study of the place names of the major and minor battlefields in Europe at any time, and publish them in succession. The content is mainly related to current events. Other geographical scholars such as population, products, and customs will be lacking. The translations used are based on the Comprehensive English-Chinese Dictionary published by the Commercial Press, for the sake of convenience only. (In fact, if the various news agencies can avoid being bothered and follow this example, the translations of place names will naturally be the same by agreement.) Editor's Note.</p>
<p>Flanders is the coastal area from Calais in France to the Schelde River in Belgium and the Lys River basin. The coastline is more than 40 miles long. Along the coast are ports such as Dunkirk, Ostend, and Zeebroge. The majority of the residents are the Flemish people. At the end of the last European war, that is, on September 28, 1918, the Allied forces of Britain, France, and Belgium (the Belgian army was on the left wing, the French army was in the center, and the British army was on the right wing), under the command of King Albert I of Belgium, adopted an offensive. By October 1, they had attacked eight miles into the German positions. By October 17, the last German troops withdrew from the port of Ostend. This was the "Battle of Flanders."</p>
<p>The Schelde River is also known as the Escaut River by the French. It originates in France, passes through Belgium and the Netherlands, and flows into the North Sea. It is the boundary line of the Flanders region. Carnbrai, Valenolennes, Tournai, Oudenarde, Ghent, and Antwerp are all important cities along the river. The river is 250 miles long.</p>
<p>Artois is the area around the city of Arras in northern France. It is not easy to find on the map. Before the French Revolution, it was once divided into a province. Now it is only an empty place name that people generally call. In May and June 1915, the Allied forces launched an attack on the German army from Arras in order to contain the German army and prevent them from dividing their forces to the Eastern Front to resist the Russian army. The British army made some progress, but the number of officers killed and wounded was as high as 22,923, and the number of soldiers was as high as 476,553. The advance was unsuccessful. This was the "Battle of Artois."</p>
<p>The Somme River is located in northern France, 147 miles long. It originates near Saint-Quentin and flows into the English Channel. The cities of Perronne, Amiens, and Abbevine along the coast have all fallen into German hands. The river is connected to the Oise River and the Schelde River by canals. During the last European war, it was the site of two major battles. The first "Battle of the Somme" began on July 1, 1916. The main force of the British army attacked the German positions in order to contain the German offensive against Verdun. On September 15, the British army first used tanks in battle, but due to the limited number, the effectiveness was not great. The fierce battle continued until November, when the continuous rain stopped the fighting. The second "Battle of the Somme" began on March 21, 1918, which was the first act of the German army's final general offensive. At that time, the German army on the Western Front had a total of 1.5 million men and 16,000 artillery pieces. The attack was very fierce. It was not until August 8 that the British army used 450 tanks to cover the main force and defeated the German army. In this battle, 21,000 German soldiers were captured, and the British army lost only 20,000 men.</p>
<p>Sedan is a city in France, located on the right bank of the Meuse River, 164 miles northeast of Paris. During the last European war, it was occupied by the German army until it was recovered by the American and French armies before the armistice. The city became famous during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At dawn on September 1 of that year, German Chief of Staff Moltke ordered a general offensive. King Napoleon III of France was no match and surrendered with 104,000 troops. The German army suffered 9,000 casualties. This was the "Battle of Sedan."</p>
<p>Liege is a famous city in Belgium, straddling the Meuse River, surrounded by high mountains, and with a magnificent terrain. It is located 55 miles southeast of the Belgian capital and 10 miles from the German border. For the sake of the situation, it has been used as the coal, iron, and military industry center of Belgium. Of the 56 iron factories in Belgium, the city accounts for 20 of them. On August 5, 1914, the German army launched a large-scale offensive with 100,000 troops. The surrounding forts fell one after another. The city was captured on the 16th. The German army did not withdraw until the end of the last European war.</p>
<p>Louvain is a cultural city in Belgium, located on the Dyle River, 19 miles northeast of the capital. The famous University of Louvain was established in 1416. In the 16th century, it had 6,000 students. In 1914, when the German army invaded, the entire city was burned down, and the university library was also destroyed, causing enormous losses. A new library was built in 1921 with books donated by the people of the United States and other countries. It was completed in 1928 and now has more than 600,000 books, including 50,000 books donated by the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England.</p>
<h3>Review of America's Entry into the War</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>The situations in 1939 and 1914 are vastly different. We have now gained twenty-five years of experience and understand the horrors of modern warfare. However, this experience also reminds us of the great battles of Saint-Mihiel and the Argonne, and the victory marches under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. These memories bind our emotions, policies, and national interests to France more closely than in 1914. We have also understood the global changes that were unknown in 1914, and we are more aware of the extent to which America feels the impact of any major European war.</p>
<p>When the European war broke out last year, Americans perhaps had more timely news from Europe than others. Having witnessed the last world war, the Sino-Japanese War, and the wars in Abyssinia and Spain, the barbaric actions of Germany's invasion of Holland and Belgium did not shock us as severely as Germany's invasion of Belgium did in the last world war. Our basic attitude toward this war was not hastily decided under the shock of horror and wartime propaganda. We deeply know that this war will have direct implications for us in many ways, and that our country may eventually become a belligerent.</p>
<p>Today's American attitude certainly still contains the same awareness as the last time, namely that the Anglo-French Allied forces are fighting for us, or will produce a stronger pressure to prompt American intervention to prevent the defeat of Britain and France. However, the American attitude now is more self-aware and more realistic, and the necessity of intervention will naturally be considered more calmly and realistically. The indignation felt by Americans toward Germany's actions appears to be lower than in the last world war, and there is a more practical consideration of how German actions will actually affect the United States. If we passively come forward to aid Britain and France, we will more clearly know how we should act. President Roosevelt did not, like President Wilson, instruct the whole nation to be "neutral in thought". Our politicians and the public will certainly not repeat the mistake of being biased in fact while thinking that their actions are completely just and impartial.</p>
<p>We certainly won't underestimate the intensity and horror of modern warfare this time. The resentment of Americans caused by the torpedoing of the Athenia is just a weak ripple compared with the anger caused by the sinking of the Lusitania in the last world war. This is simply because we have already seen these tragedies in the catastrophe of the war itself, and are very clear that preventing these tragedies will cost an even greater price.</p>
<p>Although this war has raised many of the same issues as the last war, the background is different and the reaction is different. For example, we have acquiesced to Britain's interruption of our trade with Europe this time, but the importance of this trade to our country has greatly decreased compared with 1914.</p>
<p>Even if the American military industry prospers because of the war, it will not necessarily lead the United States to participate in the war. Merchants also have the experience of knowing that participating in the war will lose the great benefits of a neutral country, and often be subject to heavy wartime taxes and strict controls. Therefore, it can be asserted that if the United States participates in the war, it will definitely not be manipulated by the industrial or financial sectors. This is simply because the industrial and financial sectors are more afraid of the social and economic disruption that participation in a major war will cause than any other industry.</p>
<p>In short, if the United States is forced to participate in the war, there must be even more important reasons to make it do so. However, the chances of sending troops will be less than in 1914. The crux of the matter is not whether the United States will participate in the war, but under what conditions it will participate. The United States' precautionary measures to avoid being drawn into the vortex and the strength of its naval and air forces are already quite sufficient. What is unprepared is the failure to stipulate what interests are vital to the survival of the United States, and what the goals of the United States must be to participate in the war.</p>
<p>Regardless of who wins or loses, some kind of new international system must be established in the midst of devastation. However, what kind of system is welcomed by the United States? To what extent are we willing to do our best to promote its realization?</p>
<p>These are the real questions. What will be decided now may not be how the United States can stay out of it, but what wise actions the United States should take to promote a new situation and avoid repeating the mistakes of participating in the last war. (Translated from the American magazine Life)</p>
<h3>The Recipe of the Famous Aviator Colonel Lindbergh</h3>
<p>The situation in Europe greatly affects the United States, because our relationship with her is not a relationship with one of the belligerents, but with both sides. We are materially and spiritually concerned about the well-being of both belligerents. In the spiritual aspect, we are concerned with preserving European civilization; in the material aspect, we need to preserve the strength of Europe. In either aspect, what we need is a united and not a divided nation.</p>
<p>This European war will be protracted, which is not beneficial to either the United States or Western civilization. The longer the war lasts, the weaker our national family will be, and the more likely it will be to invite foreign disasters. American policy should always be against the mutual killing of the homeland, and should use our strength as an example to promote peace.</p>
<p>But we must not deceive ourselves into thinking that we can promote peace in Europe by participating in the war or guaranteeing treaties. If we want to lay a lasting peace, we should avoid and not repeat the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles. Those who have the ability to fight should abandon their ambition to fight. This matter is of great importance, there is no way to follow, only to use wisdom, no guarantee, only satisfaction.</p>
<p>The last European war has proven the mistake of the United States sending fleets to Europe to participate in the war. The victory we promoted not only failed to establish justice and righteousness, but the self-killing war has become more intensified. We cannot force peace on a powerful nation that has no intention of peace. Anyone who has read the history of Britain, Germany, and France knows that the idea of conquest often exceeds the pursuit of peace when there is an opportunity.</p>
<p>Our policy should be to quell the war in Europe within the realm of possibility, otherwise we should stand aside and let the various European countries find their own way home. By watching from the sidelines, we will have a strong Western country left to preserve the torch of culture and lead the way in the European ruins. If Western civilization does not share the same fate as Roman civilization, Greek civilization, Egyptian civilization, and Babylonian civilization, then the torch of culture should be kept among us. (Abridged translation from Atlantic Monthly)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt's Words</h3>
<p>The idea of ​​North and South America being able to close themselves off is not only useless, but also impossible. If our country's national defense policy is based on this idea, it will only invite future attacks. The various events of the past two weeks have dispelled many illusions of the isolationist faction. Their illusion that the United States is in a remote location and can isolate itself for protection has also been eliminated. We are now becoming more realistic, but we should not underestimate our own strength.</p>
<p>At this moment, the whole world, including the American hemisphere, is being threatened by great destruction. North and South America must quickly replenish their military equipment to deal with everything. The way of life we ​​want to protect and create is not only for the Americas, but for all mankind. Our responsibility is great and our mission is noble.</p>
<p>I pray day and night for peace in this crazy world. All of our countrymen must be in the same prayer. In a common devotion to mankind, we pray that God will heal the injuries of mankind and soothe the hearts of mankind.</p>

<h3>Looking at the Sky Through a Tube</h3>
<p>Last month, on the twenty-first day, the two Empress Dowagers and the Emperor departed from the capital to Huiling to perform the ceremony of eternal burial. Wooden walls were set up next to the imperial chariot to prevent the common people from peeking, which is etiquette. However, a certain Westerner, having no way to look at the sky and longing for the sun, wanted to rent a house next to the imperial road in the capital and privately open a window to peek at the arrival of the holy chariot; as a result, he endured many hardships and lay in ambush outside the city before he was able to catch a glimpse of the Emperor's face. When the man first left the capital, he carried luggage, along with one Manchu servant and one Beijing servant, as if he were a traveler on a long journey, and looked for an inn to stay in. There were many military officers in the inn. When they saw the man arrive, the innkeeper refused to let him stay, and specially reported to the officials, politely saying to the man that this place was not very convenient, and that it would be better to find a quiet place elsewhere. The man said that he still felt comfortable here, and that he was tired for many days and did not want to move to another place. The officials did not listen, and immediately sent soldiers to forcibly lead the man to a remote temple, and also asked the man's name and what he had come for? They were very verbose, and the soldiers who were sent kept guard and did not leave the man's side, not allowing the man to take a step out of the temple gate. However, the man was determined to go out, so he allowed them to do what they wanted for the time being, and toured the temple briefly. At six o'clock, the gate was closed and locked. The man saw a broken wall next to the temple that could be crossed over, and the soldiers urged him to go inside, and the man listened to them. After a while, he used a trick to send the soldiers to another room, and the man immediately crossed the wall and went out.</p>

<h3>How to Commemorate "June 3rd Festival"?</h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>Children, tomorrow (June 3rd) is the annual "June 3rd" Commemoration Day again!</p>
<p>June 3rd is two important commemoration days, one is the commemoration of Lin Zexu of the Qing Dynasty burning opium of British merchants, and the other is the commemoration of the strike of the Shanghai business community. Now, they are described separately as follows, children, please remember and don't forget!</p>
<p>(1) In the nineteenth year of Daoguang (1839 AD), Lin Zexu was appointed Governor-General of Liangguang to investigate and handle the opium ban at the seaports. Lin enforced the ban vigorously and burned more than 20,000 boxes of opium transported by British merchants at Humen. It was the 73rd year before the Republic of China (1839 AD) on June 3rd. After the establishment of the National Government, this day was designated as the "Drug Ban Commemoration Day", called "June 3rd Commemoration".</p>
<p>(2) In May of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919 AD), our eastern neighbor forced us to recognize the Twenty-One Demands. Students in Peiping launched the May Fourth Movement, and many students were arrested. On June 3rd, the Shanghai business community went on strike as a whole, and the inland also responded one after another! The Northern Government finally dismissed Cao (Rulin), Zhang (Zongxiang), and Lu (Zongyu), and released the students. The matter subsided. This was the first time that our country's business community participated in a political movement, so it is also called "June 3rd Commemoration".</p>
<p>Children, Lin Zexu's firmness, decisiveness, unyielding, and indomitable spirit and achievements are enough to compete with the sun and the moon! Lin's being demoted to Yili also shows the darkness and confusion of the politicians of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Twenty-One Demands of the country's demise not only awakened the students' fighting spirit, but also alerted those who were absorbed in profit and did not avoid the country's demise, and realized the current common unity of fighting for national liberation. Isn't there a reason for this? However, the general treacherous merchants on the isolated island who take advantage of the national crisis to speculate in trade and oppress the people's lives have not yet shown any signs of understanding, which is really regrettable! I hope that when children see their fathers, mothers, or older brothers and sisters (who are married) behaving in the above-mentioned ways, they will earnestly plead with them and tell them the meaning of "June 3rd Commemoration". This is the responsibility that every child should fulfill!</p>
<h3>Commemorating Mr. Lin Zexu</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>Children, tomorrow is the Tobacco Ban Commemoration Day, let me tell you a story.</p>
<p>During the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, Lin Zexu was the Governor-General of Huguang. He hated opium very much, so he asked the Qing government to ban it strictly. The Qing government paid attention to his report and sent him as an imperial envoy to Guangdong to investigate. When he arrived in Guangzhou, he strictly arrested treacherous merchants selling opium, and ordered British merchants to hand over all the opium they had hidden. The British merchants refused, so Lin sent troops to surround the British merchant ships and cut off their food supply. The British merchants had no choice but to hand over 20,283 boxes of opium. He transported this much opium to the coast of Humen and burned it all.</p>
<p>Later, the British government sent many warships to attack Guangdong first. Because Lin's defense was tight, they could not capture it, so they turned to attack various coastal areas, and then attacked Tianjin in the north, and then captured Zhenjiang, directly approaching Nanjing. The Manchu Qing government not only did not punish the officials stationed in these places, but said that Lin Zexu was wrong and should not have started the war lightly. So Lin Zexu was dismissed from office and punished, and people were sent to negotiate peace with the British army and sign the Treaty of Nanjing. This happened in the twenty-second year of Daoguang.</p>
<p>Since the failure of this opium ban, foreign opium can be transported to China in a grand and aboveboard manner, poisoning it endlessly. Since the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has advocated strictly banning opium, so June 3rd is designated as the Opium Ban Commemoration Day, and the people of the whole country are vigilant and reflect on it.</p>
<h3>The Museum Will Hold a Competition for School Children's Collection Items</h3>
<p>— A Jin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Museum, jointly organized by the Asian Literary Association and Shangxiantang at No. 20 Museum Road in this city, intends to promote educational effectiveness, encourage school children to collect and collect, and encourage primary and secondary school students to use summer vacations to have more contact with the natural world: The news that a competition and exhibition of school children's collection items will be held in the autumn of this year has been seen in the Education News column of this newspaper on the 30th of last month. However, the record is still lacking in detail, so I will add it below to inform the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>The purpose of this event is purely to encourage children to feel the interest in collecting, and it is also an important way to increase knowledge; and to prevent them from wasting their holidays, and to use them to explore and improve themselves. The confirmed date is in September after the summer vacation this year; the detailed methods have not yet been decided, and will be announced later. However, from now on, regardless of natural specimens, and favorite items such as coins, cigarette pictures, stamps, toys, etc., all those collected and collected by school children on weekdays or in the future; can be registered with the administrative section of the hospital, using personal names, or using school names to participate in groups is even more welcome.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time Movement</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Children, you probably all know that the Daylight Saving Time Movement has started under the approval of the工部局(Gōngbùjú) from yesterday (June 1st). What is the Daylight Saving Time Movement? When we explore its meaning, we can know that it is to set the town point one hour faster during the four months (June 1st to September 31st) of the summer when the days are long and the nights are short; in this way, we can get up earlier in the first half of the day, and get an extra hour in the second half of the day to recover from the fatigue of the first half of the day or do some considerable entertainment.</p>
<p>Summarizing the results of all aspects, promoting the Daylight Saving Time Movement has more advantages than disadvantages, so everyone should promote and practice it vigorously.</p>
<p>What time did you get up today? The author knows that there are many children who always get up late every day, and sometimes they have to wait for their mothers to wake them up. They will never get up on their own. Now, you shouldn't be like this anymore. The first key point of the Daylight Saving Time Movement is to tell everyone to get up early. Getting up early and going to bed early is the secret to strengthening the body.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we should pay special attention to here is that in the extra hour in the afternoon, we must not use it for playing and playing. Taking this opportunity, we can read a few more books and do more meaningful extracurricular activities. We must all know that this hour is definitely not for us to go home early and watch a play with our parents, or to go to the road to "ride bicycles", "skate", or "build houses"!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to hope with 120,000 points of sincerity that all of you children can get some progress in body, mind, and knowledge from the "Daylight Saving Time Movement", so that it will not fail the original intention of saving.</p>
<h3>Epidemic</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>"What does the pathogen look like? Why have I never seen it?"</p>
<p>"You say you've never seen it, and you can't blame you, because the pathogen is a very tiny bacteria, so our naked eyes can't see it, but it can be seen under a microscope. The scope of bacteria is very large and there are many types, and pathogens are one of the bacteria, but there are so many types of pathogens that can be the same. Every disease has a pathogen. However, the shapes of bacteria are nothing more than spherical, rod-shaped, and spiral-shaped. Although the shapes of various bacteria are different, they are generally similar. The reproduction of bacteria is really rapid. Each bacterium divides once every half hour. Imagine that after 24 hours a day, their division number is really amazing. In other words, they are waiting for the opportunity to invade the human body at all times, that is, we are likely to get sick at any time. Although their reproduction is so fast, they die when they see sunlight, so their mortality rate is also very high. Not all bacteria are harmful. The yeast bacteria during fermentation are of great benefit to us, but pathogens are indeed our unforgettable enemies."</p>
<p>"Then, will we get sick every time a pathogen invades the human body?"</p>
<p>"No, this depends on the strength of the human body, because when bacteria invade our body, the white blood cells in the blood seem to be ordered to declare war on the bacteria, so a big battle occurs. If our body is strong, then the white blood cells are very brave, and the resistance force is also very strong. Of course, they are invincible and invincible, and the bacteria are annihilated. If the body is not strong, then the white blood cells are disheartened and discouraged, and have to beg the bacteria for mercy and reconciliation. As a result, the bacteria destroy the body's tissues one by one in the body without restraint, so we go to hire a doctor for diagnosis and treatment, injections and medicine, that is, to add a new force to the white blood cells and invigorate them. Finally, the hateful bacteria are destroyed, and the body's tissues are reconstructed, that is, the body recovers its health."</p>
<h3>Two Farmers and Clouds — Flynn's Fable —</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yilin</p>
<p>There were two farmers walking together. A said to B in a pitiful tone that he believed the black clouds over there were a sign of misfortune. William replied cheerfully, "Why?" John replied, "I bet it's going to hail. The wheat will be damaged, and not a single ear of wheat will be left, followed by famine." William said kindly, "You're really dreaming! On the lead-colored clouds, I can't see anything else, but there's a lot of rain hidden inside. This rain will not only not harm, but will make us a bumper harvest. This year will be a ripe year, so let's be happy. Have a glass of ale to thank this rain!" John said angrily, "You're talking nonsense!" William also retorted, "You're blind!" The quarrel started like this, and the more they quarreled, the more fierce it became, almost to the point of fighting. Suddenly, a gust of wind came and dispersed the clouds. As a result, neither of them argued anymore!</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (5)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Since I took my first dance class, I have been practicing the little tiptoe steps very hard. If there is no work in the studio, I am always jumping around in the house and garden all day long. Jack and Sanan have to go to school to study every day, but I keep disturbing them, insisting that they watch me dance. They hate it very much and shout at me, "Get out of here, get out of here! Shirley, don't always pester us." At that time, I didn't hate them either, because there was really nothing to see in this kind of dance step, just jumping up and down and slightly shaking the toes.</p>
<p>Now my two brothers are proud of me because of me. The day before yesterday, Jack and two classmates came back from Stanford University, and took them upstairs to see me in my doll room. He said to his two classmates very wisely, "The one sitting on the floor over there is my little sister Shirley." Then he wanted to prove that I was indeed his sister, so he lowered his head and kissed me. But his two classmates could never do that. As for Sanan, I have also heard him boast to his classmates at the New Mexico Military Academy, praising my little sister so much. The beginning was the beginning, and now is now; at the beginning, the two of them really didn't like my dancing.</p>
<p>But after I took the fifth and sixth dance classes, my feet became much more proficient. I have danced the steps very well, and I can already dance the soft shoe tap dance. When I practice at home, if I don't turn on the radio, I hum softly in my mouth. What I often hum is the Yellow River tune, and soon I have sung it very well. Sometimes my mother plays the piano for me, pressing the keys with only two fingers, and I sing along. Even until recently, whenever I needed to sing in a starring film, I always practiced like this beforehand. Mr. Sheehan, who presided over the Fox Studio, encouraged me to learn piano formally, so he sent me a small piano, which is still placed in the flat house on the studio, and I go to play it from time to time.</p>
<h3>Self-Control</h3>
<p>Young people, lacking or possessing little experience as a foundation, are not qualified to be the ultimate authority on morality. Moral standards should not be deemed wrong simply because they oppose them. They sometimes bring up many questions to ask ministers, and come up with all sorts of answers, not knowing that their answers have long been seen many times in history. For example, their "self-expressionism" was something that people in Greece had spoken of thousands of years ago. The saying, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die," though worded differently, has the same meaning. Of course, so-called moral standards do not require us to accept them without question, and they are not necessarily good just because they have existed for many years. However, some are derived from experience and are not wrong. The Ten Commandments are eternal truths, and no matter how many ages pass, the standards of right and wrong cannot be changed. Those who violate the commandments immediately suffer the consequences, like an echo responding to a sound. Otherwise, wouldn't the world become a madhouse, and how could human affairs be maintained? Only when people adhere to morality can culture progress. The fundamental laws of conduct are eternal, universally applicable, neither old nor new. Those who ignore or violate them will inevitably face danger. Young people say, "Go your own way," but we must ask, "Are you worthy of expressing yourself?" Freedom certainly does not mean no governance. A free life is one lived under the governance of a great purpose and self-confidence. A ship with a captain can reach its port on time; otherwise, it will drift aimlessly, and the danger is extreme. People achieve their goals through governance. Paul said, "Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training." A life without restraint is unlawful and can lead to the ruin of individuals and nations. I believe that valuable "self-expressionism" comes from the strictest self-control. Anyone who wants to gain life must seek it through self-control and training. Obeying the laws of conduct and practicing strict self-control is the secret to achieving a perfect and powerful life. (The End)</p>

<p>Movie Star Awards</p>
<h3>The Adored Performers</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Movie stars who have won awards prove that their acting skills are unparalleled. Logically, they deserve to be proud in front of everyone. But what is the actual situation? They all have stars they admire in their own eyes.</p>
<p>Charles Laughton, who won the Best Actor Award in 1933, most admired the famous screen comedian Charlie Chaplin in his life. At a Hollywood banquet, he told a female reporter from a British magazine: "It amazes me why an actor like Chaplin has never won an award. If someone asked me to choose the three best films in film history, I would choose all the masterpieces he starred in!"</p>
<p>Paul Muni, who won the award in 1936, said on weekdays: "I respect all the stars who have a little specialty." After watching "The Story of Louis Pasteur" last year, Robert Donat became the star he admired most. Conversely, Robert Donat, who won the award last year because of that film, reportedly admires Paul Muni!</p>
<p>Bette Davis has won two awards. She does not have innate beauty. She is supported by fans because of her acting skills, so it is not easy to have a star she admires. Who is it, do you know? It is Errol Flynn. "If you ask him to play a tough movie, he can pick up a bow, get on his horse, and gallop between the wild valleys and mountains. If you ask him to play a soft one, he can be considerate and make people feel happy." These are the words Bette Davis commented on him!</p>
<p>Victor McLaglen won the award in 1935 for starring in "The Informer." Because the films he starred in were consistently crude, the stars he admired could not escape the heroic flavor. The late Douglas Fairbanks was the star he admired most. It is said that when the bad news of Fairbanks' death first reached his ears, he, who never shed tears, could not help but shed a few drops.</p>
<h3>Interview with Ma Lianliang (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Ai Ping Studio</p>
<p>Most Fond of Recording</p>
<p>(Question) I heard that you have made the most recordings. How many are there in total?</p>
<p>(Answer) I have been most fond of recording in my life, and I have a special interest in it. I believe that people in this world must have something that can be commemorated and passed on to future generations. Since we are performers, the only thing that can be used for later generations to commemorate is singing. Therefore, I am extremely happy to do recording, and it does not start today. I have heard of co-recordings with colleagues, such as "Fishing and Killing the Family" with Mr. Mei Lanfang, "Sang Yuan Hui" with Mr. Shang Xiaoxia, etc., too many to remember, but most of them are self-recorded. Among them, many plays are no longer performed later, and after recording, they can be saved as a souvenir. There are also various recordings that have never been performed, such as the two plays of "Da Zhou Xing Long". Although I have them in my records, I have never performed them outside. Another example is the play "Feng Yun Hui", which has never been performed, but has been recorded. According to statistics, I have recorded more than 110 kinds of films in various companies as of 1929, which seems to be the most recorded among my colleagues. However, later, I joined Ms. Wang Yurong to record the entire Wu Jia Po, etc., and its number is probably more than one hundred and ten kinds!</p>
<p>(Question) I heard that you founded a recording company. When was it?</p>
<p>(Answer) This was in the spring of 1932. I saw that the recording business was very developed in foreign countries, so I united with comrades in the education field, such as Mr. Ma Buyun, Hong Jiying, and Shen Mugong, and hired two American technicians. The address of the company was in Yu Yu Hutong and Bingzha Hutong in the eastern city of the old capital. Unfortunately, the success of a business is very difficult. After spending a lot of money without success, I was disheartened and announced the closure of the business!</p>
<p>On this day, Mr. Ma talked for a long time. Mr. Ma's eloquence was very strong, like a flood of water. Mr. Huan Sun also added some information, which made my pen almost unable to record everything. Moreover, because of the urgent time, it is difficult to guarantee that the record is accurate. I hope readers and Mr. Ma will forgive me. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Final Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1 "A Very Pretty Lady!"</p>
<p>This morning, the weather was such that one could not do without a undershirt inside a dress shirt. The sky had cleared up. Patches of white clouds, some deep, some light, moved very quickly, setting off the most beautiful azure background, conjuring up all kinds of strange beasts and weird rocks. The scene changed with its movement. The new leaves on the French paulownia trees on the sidewalk outside our door were washed by the rain the night before and became more fertile and verdant. If there was a way to estimate it, the speed of growth this night must have increased more than usual.</p>
<p>I was alone in the downstairs office having a simple breakfast—congee. Hawthorne's morning outdoor exercise had not yet finished. This was an old habit that he had maintained for decades, and it was a good habit that I agreed with but never had the courage to implement. Suddenly, a clear doorbell broke the silence of the morning, which made me stop my chopsticks. It was not Hawthorne coming back, he did not need to press the doorbell. But why did the visitor come so early? Then, Shi Gui's footsteps opened the door and came in. He reported to me, "Mr. Bao, a lady." He lowered his voice a little and added—"A very pretty lady!——"</p>
<p>Shi Gui—Hawthorne's old servant, and also our old servant—was getting old, but his appreciation of beauty clearly had not been lost or diminished. His report made me a little embarrassed. Because I was not dressed yet, I was only wearing a blue-striped white cotton robe, and my feet were bare, wearing a pair of brown leather slippers. It seemed inconvenient to see guests like this, especially female guests. But in fact, I could not hesitate at all. The female guest had already walked into Hawthorne's office, which served as a dining room, with the sound of high heels.—(2)</p>
<h3>Twenty Kinds of Ballads</h3>
<p>— Compiled and Written by Xiu Yan, Illustrated</p>
<p>(9) Ten Beauties Picture</p>
<p>It was during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>The so-called ten beauties do not all belong to one person, but are divided between the Zeng brothers; Zeng Rong got six of them, and Zeng Gui got four.</p>
<p>The Zeng brothers are descendants of loyal and good people, but most of the ten beauties are the daughters of powerful and treacherous officials. Yan Lanzhen is Yan Song's daughter-in-law, and Zhao Wanzhen is Zhao Wenhua's daughter. The Yue opera "Pan Fu Suo Fu" is the love triangle story of Zeng Rong, Yan Lanzhen and Zhao Wanzhen.</p>
<p>The whole book takes the story of treacherous parties framing loyal and good people as the warp, and the love affairs of children as the weft.</p>
