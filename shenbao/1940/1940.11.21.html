<p>重慶　此間官方頃稱、渠等對所傳日本和平提議、並無所知、此種事實、縱令爲眞、亦不過係日人重演故技、而圖製造有利於日本之空氣者、華官方又評論日方所謂重慶若再不埋日、日將承認「南京政府」一語、謂日人經三年半之在華戰事、猶未認識中國民族之精神與士氣、不知中國果能對武力屈服、則決不能以如此決心戰事至若久是之、（廿日合衆社雷）</p>
<p>重慶　聞遼黑吉熱四省政府已向中央政府建議、在省政府正式組織之前、設立秘書處、以進行組緞事宜、按本年初國民政府曾任命四省主席、蓋外間有中日媾和之際、中國或願放棄東四省之謠諑、故特藉此表示中國擬恢復該四省之決心、（二十日合衆社電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　此間與遠東有密切接觸之人士、預料不久日本將進攻西貢與康瀾灣、及越南日軍侵犯泰國、據東京電訊、謂日報痛斥英美包圍日本、並警吿泰國及西貢與此項民治國聯絡、此間認日報此種論調、爲軸心國在侵略前所作抗議之慣技、惟信日本各領袖似未忘却南進、須以英國之失敗爲依歸、故日本雖儘可能攫取所有不致引起英美行動之領土、但在義海陸軍在地中海有較好之表現及德國對英更獲勝利之前，將未必對香港新加坡或荷印有所行動、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國當局昨日絕對吾認日本報紙所載英美泰秘密軍事協定之消息、此項東京日文報紙所大加宣傳之消息、當局認爲「全無根據」、當局謂此種消息之刊載、「令人更爲密切注視時局之發展」、英國當局視此日本所傳之英美泰協定、有若空放紙鳶、當局稱、此舉引起「何以日本放此紙鳶之揣測」、官塲譏諷日本圖謀造成央美似方企圖擾亂泰國與越甫之關係、以困維希之局面、當局謂此項消息、全非事實、（二十日合衆電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>動盪的歐局與日本的南進</h3>
<p>最近旬日以來，軸心國家的外交攻勢顯出空前活躍：莫洛托夫聘德之後，繼之以安托尼斯科與孫納的分訪德義，　納並與德義兩國外長一度舉行會議於薩里斯堡；而括有羅匈保南諸國的中歐會議，亦將於日內由德義主持，在維也納召開。此外德義雙方軍事領袖，亦曾於十五日在奧境殷司勃魯克舉行軍事會議。凡此一切都顯示着歐洲的外交和軍事形勢，今後當有急劇的展開，無論其是吾能挽回軸心國家的聲威與頹勢，要可見德義當局之目光四射與力求發展。而德義另一同盟者的日本，際此究將採取何等態度和步驟，自然是極可注意的一件事。</p>
<p>三國盟的之簽訂，於今將近兩月，其內慕運用經過雖不能爲世人所盡悉，但就各方事實觀察，可信德義與日本均尙未因締盟而有所收穫。且彼此行動也未能盡相合拍，甚至連盟約第四條所規定的三國聯合技述委員會都未能「儘速」開會，獲致政治經濟軍事互助的力案。到最近，德義種種佈置和運用幾乎與日本全不相干——只有將近召開的維也納會議據說也許邀請日駐德大使來栖參加——日本緩和美記關係的種種姿態，似乎亦非三國締盟的本意。像這樣各行其是的同盟國家，幾如其間並無何種聯繫存在。雖然其間日本亦曾對各方竭盡縱橫裨闔的能事，但却並非以三國共同利益爲基準，而僅止着眼於日本本身的需要。這種情事，確是會使若干人士感覺費解的。</p>
<p>但是三國同盟的締結，雙方雖均是在無可如何之中聊以自娛，究不會沒有經過一番精密的打算。有人說：假使三國間的談判不是在德義頹勢尙未充分顯露的九月間吿一段落，說不定又會走上平沼時代的覆轍而重吿流產；這種觀察不過是片面眞理，僅看到三國關係的陰暗面而忽視了其相互勾結的需求。德義之被封鎖於歐陸，日本實力之屆近耗竭，自早爲雙方彼此所洞悉，亦唯其如此，是以相互有需求聲援呼應的必要；此中主要中心問題厥爲德義對英的攻勢與日本的南進，而允以南進一事最能發揮彼此勾結的效果。何况南進已成日本此際僅存的一條生路，國際壓力越大，南進需求愈殷，無論其是吾立即發生武裝衝突，抑或究屬經濟性質還是政治性質，那都必然要分散英美視綫和注意力，且牽制其實力。是以日方如果更急進些，自然爲德義所樂聞而亟謀力促其進行；日方而從事緩進，德義縱微感不耐，但亦不致對之過分苛求；因爲日方實力的支絀原屬盡人皆知的事實，德義又復不能提供有力支援，則日方縱使僅事種種爲自身的打算，只要其並不放棄根本的南進路綫，自不能驟即斷爲彼此的貌合神離。</p>
<p>因爲下列種種事實上的牽制，最近日本的南進策略是比較側重緩進和經濟方面的。第一，日本的現狀，還需要相當準備以待更有利時機的到來；第二，他在內外經濟壓迫之下，不能不亟於覓取相當資源以濟眉急。日政府最近對美的外交攻勢，即意在延宕美方壓力和制裁，並企圖在對美商業關係尙未完全閉塞之前吸取最後的經濟實利。同時更對於荷印越南以至中南美洲，都使節四出，進行商業談判，以儘可能攫取資源。然而這些只是日方南進企圖的局部面目；另一方面，也未嘗不以伺機而動的姿態從事軍事行動的準備。其對中國的和平攻勢，在南戰塲的撒退軍隊，都不外是此種準備的一部。日前日海軍大將高橋所發日美終須一戰的言論，固然是對於內外的一種試探，亦未嘗不是道出其內心的認識。十三日日本所召集的御前會議。據說是討論「中國事變」，並歸結於對華誘和或承認南京組織，料其對於如何調整或縮短在華戰綫，俾抽調實力作南進配備亦必有重大之考慮。此人幸勿因日方最近對外種種姿態之較形緩和且着重於經濟方面之運用而看輕了南太平洋上的重大危機。</p>
<p>最近歐局的新發展，自然又是日方從事新的冒險的時機，雖德義方處在不利狀態下，其未來企圖亦未必竟能衝破英方羅綱而重建軸心的優勢，然而無論如何，日方必不會輕易放過歐局動盪不安的有利因素。如果此度來栖眞被邀請參預維也納會議，那更暗示德義對日期望之殷與彼此間的勾結已因歐亞形勢的演進而達到新的節段。現在南太平洋整個前途尙待判明，各方正有嚴密注視的必要；而西貢與越南全局之岌岌可危已無異於兩月以前之越北，幸望其勿再因關係國家警覺的不足而重爲越北之續。</p>

<p>自由談	耶穌作我心之主（五）　　（五）耶穌－愛情之主：（Jesus.Lordof　the　Affectlons）人們心是最神聖不過的是情愛。　言四章23節：「要保守你的心，勝這保守一切，因爲一生的果效，都是由心發出的」。許多人因爲用情不當，或是用在不值得的事物上，以致生活遭遇了失敗。生活的危機，再沒有　流露情愛的時候那樣的重要。還是生活的樞紐。人的一生幸福，都在因愛情所發生的關係而決定了。如此看來，尊基督爲情愛之主，實是一件迫切的事。「虔誠奉獻我的心，屬主堪爲主買位；」　　我們斷不可讓情愛一發無　，任情縱慾，爲所欲爲，常以基督爲用情之範圍，事事尊祂爲主。世界上從沒有人像祂那樣愛過我們，也從沒有人表現過像祂那樣的愛心。我們第一個人都可以說：「上帝的兒子愛我，並且爲我而捨去衪自己」。我們應該以真實的虔誠，和願服的心意，去響應這偉大的愛。在我們看來，真正的愛，是具有三個條件的：（1）愛慕：詩篇第七十三篇25節說：「除你主以外，在地上我無所愛慕了」。上帝喜歡我們愛慕他。我們應學先知以賽亞說：「我心所愛慕的是你的聖名」（賽二十六８）（２）喜悅：愛必有其所喜之目標。上帝喜悅他自己的子民，所以每一個上帝的子民都可以說：「他拯救我，因爲他喜悅我」（詩十八19）所以我們喜悅他，正如詩人說：「要以耶和華爲樂」（詩三十七4）（3）奉獻：人的情愛，如受耶穌編制，他就當虔誠奉獻他自己，樂於爲主服務。有了耶穌的愛，我們就不當專爲自己生活，當爲那爲我死百復活的主生活。這樣就不致有錯誤的用情，和徬徨莫知所之的愛。他們情愛或爲神聖而且是爲耶穌所控制的了。讀者欲知詳細，請函詢上海愛文義路三五一號文字布道社，當有詳細答覆。職業夜班  激人　　五星期的夜班生活過去了，這該是最後的一星期。爲了工作與責任，在晚上當班的時候，我總得想法子使自己有着頂大的興趣和希望。　　八點鐘一到，和往常一樣的，在紅燈下開始了我們的工作。病室沉溺在黑暗裹，除了十六號床一個折斷了腿骨病的呻吟外，沒有更大的聲息。那個噪動得頂厲害的開腹膜炎病人，巳在白天死去了。　　在微弱的電簡光裹，我替病人整理着床舖，加上了絨毯，使病人都合上了眼睛。於是，我依照了醫生的命令，準備着上熱濕敷，給藥，給飲食，擦背等治療的工作。　　十一時左右，我做完了這些事，進晚餐的時候到了。有另外一個同學，代替我留在病房裹。吃飯的時候，想使自己興奮點，可是這似乎有點不可能的，飯菜好像都變了苦味，連白天喜歡吃的東西，現在也覺得討厭了。　　夜半，病室裏更靜寂了，我的脚步得更輕地在病床邊移動，小心地把絨毯拉上了病人的身體。二十個病人全睡得很好，連十六號床折斷腿骨的病人，因爲服了安眠藥也熟睡着。病人不冉向我要開水喝，帮助他們翻身，鈴是我也得在我的工作桌邊坐了下來。　　那盞半明不滅的燈，無力地照着。我拿起了一本護士論理的書本，準備翻看一下，看了半小時，眼開始迷糊起來，我記不起看的是什麼。在病室裏繞了一週，又坐了下來，我怕我的脚步聲會使病人驚醒。　　室外的鐘擺聲，今夜似乎特別刺耳，夜是過得太緩慢了。要是我現在冉做日班，我一定不會希望夜變得更長些，睡是甜蜜的，當了夜班，誰都會體味到這個。但是，我很知道道甜蜜不應該是我的，我應該守着，守着！無論這夜的誘惑是怎樣的深，美。　　我立起來，擦着眼，我拚命地用眼睛注意着每個病人，我希望他們　彈一下，而我要開水喝，卽使咳嗽一聲也好，只要能把我的精神振奮過來，什麼都不會使我覺得麻煩的。但，他們都不這樣，他們都睡得很好。　　上午兩點鐘，我父坐下來寫報吿，接着預備寫日記。燈光比前更顯得黯淡，心裏有着奇特的感覺，想起了白天只睡五小時半（因爲下午三時半就得起來上課），更覺到疲乏得不能支待。我漸漸地昏沉了過去，睡了嗎？我不敢相信，但是，我父不能不相信，因爲我的鋼筆告訴我——我是瞌睡了——它已不在我的手裹，掉在地上，並且被我的脚踏破了筆奕。我覺到了恐怖，我開始迷糊起來，我怕第二號床的病人把傷口裹的皮管拿了出來，我更怕第六號床的病人將帶解鬆。等到看了他們後，才知道我的幻想是錯誤的。　　天快亮了，病人還是很安靜地睡着，天際透露了一綫微光，我很淸醒了，一種莫名的感覺把我猛烈地襲擊着。我爲什麼　陸睡呢？我開始悵自己了——我恨我的頭腦，眼睛，手，脚，——只要是身體上的一部份，我都恨，因爲牠們使我做了頂痛苦的事——使我打了瞌睡。我不願意這樣做，可是我却不息覺地這樣做了，我知道這對於病人是怎樣危險的事情，我知道我的工作與使命。可是我能完全恨我自己嗎？不，是這十一小時的夜工作，五小時半白天的睡眠的制度使我們這樣的。但，我不應該恨誰，在爭取民族解放的鬥爭中，我們是應該更加緊着工作。可是，過度的疲勞，是會妨害工作的。　　爲了病人，爲了醫院，希望每個醫院裹的負責人，能改變晚上當班的時間，使我們能盡應盡的責任，更希望熱心爲人羣服務的人們，不斷地給我們純正的指導與批評，使整個護士界的前途轉向光明的大道進行！秋雁對白  陳浩雄作　　小雁問老雁：「這些怪鳥爲甚麼不在自己的窠內下蛋呢？」霍桑探案舞后的歸宿  程小靑著　　第十一章趙伯雄的供詞　　霍桑接續說：「你怎麼這樣呆瞪？當我們在今天淸晨一瞧見王麗蘭的屍體，你不是就發表過一個正確的見解嗎？你曾說好像是刀傷。是的，那是刀傷，那傷疲的寬度，便是個顯明的鐵證。還有槍彈穿背而出時，背孔縮小，並沒有多量的血，也可見不是槍彈致命。這原沒有什麼疑問。你怎麼忘懷了？」　　我應道：是的，我在一瞥之間就得到刀傷的印象，不過倪金壽馬上糾正我、說是槍傷；同時他說明屋中人都聽得槍聲，還有一粒他從牆壁上箝出來的槍彈，的確是穿通了王麗蘭的胸膛，而且再巧沒有，父是在同一的創口裏穿過的。因此，才使我糢糊起來，不敢冉堅持我的成見。」　　霍桑點頭說：「是啊，這案子的複雜性，就在這一點上——就在這雙重謀殺點上，其實若說是單純的槍殺，那末王麗蘭身上的飾物的失竊，便沒法解釋。事前行刦旣不可能，因爲伊不曾叫喊。伊勢不會把伊所心愛的首飾，毫無抵抗讓人家拿去。事後刦取，叉爲時間所不許，我們早晨已經討論過了。所以這明明是件　重謀殺案，一經推想，便可知刦取飾物勢必在行刺的當兒，而在打槍之先。你的見解顯然有着國際的證據，不是憑空產生，你本用不着自己懷疑。」　　「這樣說，你也早就相信王麗蘭是因刀致死的了。」　　「是的——我還假定那那眞正的兇手，也許就在那屋子裏。不過因着式甲組』皮鞋印子的關係，使我有些兒猶豫，一時還不敢決定。」　　「那末，你怎樣不爽快些就向屋中的幾個人着手？卻反而虛費功夫在外面繞圈子？」　　霍桑笑了一笑，說道：「什麼？繞圈子？虛費功夫？包朗，你怎麼說得出這樣的話？你豈不知道這案子的表面現象，手槍問題更重於刀刺問題嗎？並且那打槍的人雖不能眞個打死麗蘭，卻同樣有謀殺的企圖。打槍的人又是從外面來的牽涉的人很多，關係又很復雜。我怎能不急其所急，先把外圍肅淸一下，將那那個第二重謀殺的主角打出來呢？」　　我靜默了一下呼了兩口烟，又說道：「你當初旣然就疑心用刀刺死這舞后的就是屋子裹的人，可就知道行兇的人就是那個老頭兒李芝範嗎？」　　霍桑忽　着眉　緩緩吐吸了兩口烟，搖　說不我敢　空斷定。因爲我「起初所得到的材料不夠　不能充分知道他有什變動機。我當然不能單憑理想就下結論。」（一七二）社會看一看  切齒　　先生們，女士們：　　我斗膽，　　我斗膽請求你們，　　請你們來看一看買平糶米的情形。　　如果怕髒，　　就站得遠一點；　　再不然，　　坐了汽車來也行！　　然後我指給你們看：　　那邊，　　像垃圾似破舊的一條長長的行列，　　有：——　　老的，女的，小的……　　洶湧，熙　，推擠……　　你說他們「笑？」　　這是多少帶着點痛苦而又辛酸的，　　莫知所以的苦笑啊！　　旁邊的嗎？　　那是維持秩序的先生；　　手裏拿的是皮鞭，　　是粗粗的木棍！　　「拍！」「嗒！」　　（喔，不　拍，請你放心。）　　因爲那個小孩子「不守秩序」　　就給打了一掌，抽了一鞭。　　血！呵，掛了一身！　　（可是仍舊不要拍。）　　給冷風一吹就凝住了，　　也不過多幾條烙紋。　　怎麼！淌淚啦？　　快不要這樣　心！　　還是叫車夫開到跳舞廳去；　　不然就去看電影……</p>

<h3>Chinese Side's Responsible Person Reaffirms Determination to Continue Fighting, Confident of Recapturing Hankou and Other Important Towns, Preventing Japanese Military from Taking Risky Southern Advances</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The responsible person on the Chinese side here last night reaffirmed China's determination to continue fighting and only accept a fair and honorable peace. It is heard that apart from reports in the news of Tokyo's claims of Japan attempting to negotiate directly with Chongqing, the central government has not heard any new messages from the Japanese side regarding seeking peace. A certain Chinese commentator stated that such messages are clearly Japan resorting to old tricks in order to create a false atmosphere favorable to their plans. We are unmoved by the Japanese threats to recognize the Nanjing "puppet regime." This action by the Japanese shows that after three and a half years of war, they still do not understand the resilience of the Chinese people and still want to impose their version of peace on China. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources here widely report that someone has proposed a plan to Washington officials to provide China with a loan totaling $200 million, including the purchase of 500 aircraft, so that China can use it to launch large-scale offensives. The Chinese side is confident that it can recapture Hankou and other key locations. The significance of this war is that Japan will not be able to take major risks in Vietnam and southward. According to the proposer of this plan, half of the loan will be used to purchase aircraft, and the other half will be used to consolidate General Chiang Kai-shek's funds for maintaining 1.5 million guerrillas to disrupt Japanese transportation lines. It is said that spending $100 million to maintain this force during the war is worthwhile. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Official sources here recently stated that they were unaware of the reported Japanese peace proposals. Even if these reports are true, they are nothing more than the Japanese repeating old tricks to create an atmosphere favorable to Japan. Chinese officials also commented on the Japanese side's statement that if Chongqing does not bury the hatchet, Japan will recognize the "Nanjing Government," saying that after three and a half years of war in China, the Japanese still do not understand the spirit and morale of the Chinese nation and do not know whether China can be subdued by force. If China could be subdued by force, it would not be fighting with such determination for so long. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - It is reported that the governments of the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Rehe have suggested to the central government that a secretariat be established before the official organization of the provincial governments to carry out organizational matters. Earlier this year, the National Government appointed chairmen of the four provinces, as there were rumors that China might be willing to give up the four northeastern provinces at the time of Sino-Japanese reconciliation. Therefore, this is a special expression of China's determination to restore the four provinces. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Westward from Anyang Repelled by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Luoyang - The war situation in northern Henan is fierce. On the 14th, over 1,000 Japanese troops, with 11 artillery pieces, advanced westward from areas such as Hebbi, Anyang, and Shuiye. They were met with resistance near Zhuwo, Sangwei, and Xiaohuajiang (northwest of Hebbi). The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and used tear gas, but to no avail. After a day and night of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled by the Chinese army, with over 200 Japanese soldiers killed. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang - Japanese troops from Shangqiu in eastern Henan, traveling in over 100 vehicles and over 10 tanks, arrived at Duji Shagang and other places in the southeast on the morning of the 13th. They were met with strong resistance from the Chinese army. After a day of bloody battle, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and over 10 Japanese vehicles were destroyed. Resistance is still continuing. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang - The Chinese forces achieved excellent results on the Quyi Highway. On the morning of the 15th, they destroyed several Japanese vehicles traveling west from Yicheng at Xiyang Village and Banshi Village, killing two Japanese lieutenants, army doctors Katō Tsuneharu and Masume Keiji, as well as over 100 Japanese soldiers. They also captured two light machine guns, many rifles, two boxes of medical supplies, and a large quantity of military supplies. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Launch Successful Attacks</h3>
<p>Xiushui - Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi have been attacking the Japanese troops for days and have been very successful. (1) The Chinese attacked the Japanese near Wanjiafu (east of Anyi), killing over 100 Japanese soldiers and completely destroying the bridge there. (2) The Japanese troops in Anlong, northeast of Anyi, were heavily attacked by the Chinese and suffered heavy losses. (20th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Along the Yangtze River Sink Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>A certain location in eastern Hubei - The Chinese mobile artillery operations along the Yangtze River have achieved remarkable results. (1) On the 17th, a Japanese transport ship, traveling from Longping to near Wuxue, was hit by Chinese artillery and immediately sank. The Japanese soldiers and military supplies on board were all drowned. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. (2) The Japanese giant ship "Nishimi Maru" was sunk by the Chinese at the end of last month in the waters near Xiaoshakou (north of Jiujiang). (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese sources, a Japanese transport ship was sunk by Chinese forces on the 17th of this month while traveling from the West River to Guangzhou. Many Japanese soldiers were drowned on the spot. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>50,000 Killed in Chinese Cities by Bombings in the Last Three Years</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to charts released by the authorities today, the total value of losses suffered by foreign industries in various parts of China due to air raids in the past three years is 4,528,034 yuan in national currency. The number of civilians killed by bombings in various places reached 51,601, the number of injured was 58,260, and the number of residential and commercial buildings destroyed reached more than 200,000. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Tongcheng and Chongyang</h3>
<p>Pingjiang - The Japanese troops harassing the Chinese forces from the area between Tongcheng and Chongyang were once again fiercely attacked by the Chinese on the evening of the 17th. Unable to withstand the attack, they retreated, abandoning many Japanese corpses and baggage along the way. The Chinese are pursuing the victory. Another Chinese unit simultaneously attacked the Japanese in Tongshan and Nanlinqiao, also achieving considerable gains. The fighting was very fierce on the 18th and 19th. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>All Circles in Xi'an Hold Air Defense Donation</h3>
<p>Xi'an - As the Air Defense Festival approaches, all circles in Shaanxi have decided to hold an expanded commemoration. In addition to starting an air defense propaganda campaign on the 18th, they will also hold an air defense donation for three days starting on the 19th. Today is the first day, and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically donating. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attempt to Land in Saigon, China Blocks Yunnan-Vietnam Traffic, All Passports to Vietnam Suspended, No Goods or Items Allowed to Enter Yunnan from Vietnam, Britain Denies Military Agreement with Thailand</h3>
<p>Kunming - The Chinese government completely sealed off the Chinese border with Vietnam yesterday. At the same time, the government cancelled all passports for travel to Vietnam. This blockade affects all traffic between China and Vietnam, including travel, postal services, telecommunications, and trade. From now on, the only way to pass through the destroyed section of the railway is on foot. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Ta Kung Pao reported that the Chinese authorities ordered the complete closure of the Vietnamese border starting yesterday. Therefore, since yesterday morning, no people, goods, or mail are allowed to enter Yunnan from Vietnam or enter Vietnam from Yunnan. At the same time, the issuance of permits to enter or pass through these two areas has been suspended. It also stated that since Japan proposed to land in Saigon, the Vietnamese authorities have been trying to avoid discussing the matter with the Japanese. However, the Japanese are now threatening to land in Saigon regardless of whether Vietnam and Vichy can agree. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of Saigon is only a matter of time. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington - People here with close contacts in the Far East predict that Japan will soon attack Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, and Japanese troops in Vietnam will invade Thailand. According to Tokyo dispatches, Japanese newspapers denounced the Anglo-American encirclement of Japan and warned Thailand and Saigon not to associate with this democratic league. It is believed here that this kind of rhetoric from Japanese newspapers is the usual tactic of the Axis powers before an invasion. However, it is believed that Japanese leaders have not forgotten to advance southward, which must rely on Britain's failure. Therefore, Japan will seize as much territory as possible without provoking Anglo-American action. However, before the Italian navy performs better in the Mediterranean and Germany achieves more victories over Britain, it will probably not take any action against Hong Kong, Singapore, or the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - British authorities yesterday absolutely denied the news in Japanese newspapers about a secret Anglo-American-Thai military agreement. The authorities believe that this news, which has been heavily promoted by Japanese newspapers in Tokyo, is "completely unfounded." The authorities said that the publication of this news "makes us pay closer attention to the development of the situation." British authorities view this Anglo-American-Thai agreement reported by Japan as a kite being flown in the air. The authorities said that this action raises "speculation as to why Japan is flying this kite." Officials ridiculed Japan's attempt to create the impression that the United States and the United Kingdom are trying to disrupt relations between Thailand and Vietnam in order to trap Vichy. The authorities said that this news is completely untrue. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>France Replaces Vietnamese Officials</p>
<p>The Vichy government recently issued an order to replace high-ranking officials stationed in various protectorates and colonies in Vietnam, such as (1) Duré, the commissioner stationed in the protectorate of Laos, has been assigned to another position and ordered to return to the country immediately. The vacancy will be filled by Rocque, a first-class civil servant in Vietnam. (2) Grangeon, a first-class civil servant in Vietnam, is immediately appointed as the acting commissioner of the protectorate of Tonkin. (3) Lieuvya, a first-class civil servant in Vietnam, is immediately appointed as the acting governor of the colony of Cochinchina. (4) Winterpet, the labor supervisor stationed in Vietnam, has been assigned to another position and ordered to return to the country immediately. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - General Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, issued a letter to the Vietnamese people today, once again denying various rumors circulating outside. It stated that certain foreign news agencies and radio stations in the Far East have recently repeatedly issued various false messages, not only reversing right and wrong, but also being brazenly shameless. Fortunately, the Vietnamese people have always been knowledgeable and realistic. From now on, they will only scoff at these purely fabricated and meaningless rumors and will not be misled. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Singapore - The Thai Consul-General here today issued a formal statement denying the Japanese report that Thai and Vietnamese troops had clashed in the forests along the Mekong River in southeastern Thailand. He said that this news is not accurate. The Thai government is still willing to peacefully resolve the border issue with the Vietnamese authorities. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong News: Japan Plans to Attack Thailand</p>
<p>London - According to news from Hong Kong in this morning's Daily Express, Japanese transport ships and warships are concentrating off the coast of Saigon. At the same time, Japanese authorities are pressuring Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux to allow Japanese troops to pass through to attack Thailand. (International News Service, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Miyako Shimbun" warned Thailand yesterday not to "engage in immoral behavior towards Japan." The warning was published in an editorial attacking the rumored secret Anglo-American-Thai military agreement. "Miyako Shimbun" pointed out that Thailand had indeed signed a friendship treaty with Japan in June. The newspaper also said that the rumor that Britain had offered guarantees to Thailand, saying it would help Thailand recover lost territory belonging to Vietnam, would not materialize, "because Britain's fate in this European war has already been decided." "Miyako Shimbun" also said that Japan cannot allow any of Japan's enemies to acquire territorial benefits. The warning, which is directed at Thailand not to take "immoral actions," implies that entering into a secret military agreement with the UK and US would constitute such an "immoral action." (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A semi-official Japanese source denied today the widespread rumors abroad that Japan intends to move troops into southern Vietnam. At the same time, according to various sources, Japan's new peace proposal has been completely rejected by China. It is also rumored here that various parties close to the American military have expressed the opinion that the plan to build an air base in the Philippines is part of an Anglo-American plan to establish a chain of bases from the Philippines to Thailand to protect India and Australia. When this rumor occurred, there was excitement in Tokyo. According to news from Japan, 200 American aviators recently transferred from Shanghai to the Philippines to strengthen the island's air defense. (International News Service, 20th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Immigration Control Regulations Now in Effect</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - New regulations on immigration control, excluding Chinese, were promulgated here yesterday and took effect immediately. Any person, whether British or otherwise, who does not hold a legal passport or travel document approved for entry into Hong Kong by the British authorities and recognized by the local authorities, will not be allowed to land. As for Chinese, from December 17th, they must also have an entry permit issued by the authorities before they are allowed to enter the country. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>The Turbulent European Situation and Japan's Southern Advance</h3>
<p>In the past ten days or so, the diplomatic offensive of the Axis countries has shown unprecedented activity: after Molotov's visit to Germany, it was followed by Antonescu and Sonnann's visits to Germany and Italy. Sonnann also held a meeting with the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in Salzburg; and the Central European Conference including Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Balkans will be held in Vienna by Germany and Italy in the coming days. In addition, military leaders from both Germany and Italy also held a military conference in Innsbruck, Austria on the 15th. All this shows that the diplomatic and military situation in Europe will have a dramatic development in the future. Regardless of whether it can save the reputation and decline of the Axis countries, it can be seen that the German and Italian authorities are looking around and striving for development. And what attitude and steps Japan, another ally of Germany and Italy, will take at this time is naturally a matter of great attention.</p>
<p>The signing of the Tripartite Pact is now nearly two months ago. Although the inside operation process cannot be fully known to the world, judging from the facts in all aspects, it is credible that Germany, Italy, and Japan have not gained anything from the alliance. And their actions have not been fully coordinated, and even the Tripartite Joint Technical Committee stipulated in Article 4 of the alliance has not been able to hold a meeting "as soon as possible" to obtain a power plan for political, economic, and military mutual assistance. Until recently, Germany and Italy's various arrangements and operations were almost completely unrelated to Japan - only the Vienna conference, which is about to be held, is said to invite Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu to participate - Japan's various gestures to ease relations with the United States seem to be inconsistent with the original intention of the Tripartite Pact. Allied countries that act independently like this are almost as if there is no connection between them. Although Japan has tried its best to lobby and coordinate with all parties, it is not based on the common interests of the three countries, but only focuses on its own needs. This situation is indeed confusing to some people.</p>
<p>However, the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, although both parties are just trying to entertain themselves in desperation, will not have been without careful planning. Some say: if the negotiations between the three countries had not come to an end in September, when the decline of Germany and Italy was not fully revealed, it might have followed the same path as the Hiranuma era and declared a failure again. This observation is only a partial truth, only seeing the dark side of the relationship between the three countries and ignoring their need for mutual collusion. Germany and Italy being blocked in Europe and Japan's strength nearing exhaustion have long been known to each other. It is precisely because of this that there is a need for mutual support and response. The main central issue here is Germany and Italy's offensive against Britain and Japan's southern advance. The southern advance is the one thing that can best exert the effect of mutual collusion. Moreover, the southern advance has become the only way out for Japan at this time. The greater the international pressure, the more urgent the need for the southern advance. Whether it immediately leads to armed conflict, or whether it is economic or political in nature, it will inevitably divert the attention of Britain and the United States and contain their strength. Therefore, if Japan is more aggressive, Germany and Italy will naturally be happy to hear it and strive to promote it. If Japan is slow to advance, Germany and Italy will feel impatient, but they will not be too demanding, because Japan's lack of strength is a well-known fact, and Germany and Italy cannot provide strong support. Therefore, even if Japan is only doing various plans for itself, as long as it does not abandon the fundamental route of the southern advance, it cannot be quickly concluded that they are superficially united.</p>
<p>Because of the following factual constraints, Japan's recent southern advance strategy has been more focused on gradual progress and economic aspects. First, Japan's current situation still requires considerable preparation to await a more favorable opportunity. Second, under internal and external economic pressure, it has to urgently seek considerable resources to alleviate its immediate needs. The Japanese government's recent diplomatic offensive towards the United States is intended to delay American pressure and sanctions, and to try to absorb the final economic benefits before commercial relations with the United States are completely closed. At the same time, it is also sending envoys to the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and even Central and South America to conduct commercial negotiations in order to seize resources as much as possible. However, these are only partial aspects of Japan's southern advance attempt. On the other hand, it has also been preparing for military action in a posture of waiting for an opportunity. Its peace offensive against China and the withdrawal of troops from the southern battlefield are all part of this preparation. The statement made by Japanese Admiral Takahashi the other day that Japan and the United States must eventually fight is certainly a probe for both inside and outside, and it is not necessarily a statement of his inner understanding. The Imperial Conference convened by Japan on the 13th is said to have discussed the "China Incident" and concluded that it should induce China to make peace or recognize the Nanjing organization. It is expected that there will also be a major consideration on how to adjust or shorten the war line in China in order to withdraw its strength for southern advance preparations. People should not underestimate the major crisis in the South Pacific because Japan's recent external gestures have been relatively moderate and focused on economic operations.</p>
<p>The recent new developments in the European situation are naturally an opportunity for Japan to engage in new adventures. Although Germany and Italy are in an unfavorable state, their future attempts may not be able to break through Britain's nets and rebuild the axis's advantage. However, in any case, Japan will not easily let go of the favorable factors of the turbulent European situation. If Kurusu is really invited to participate in the Vienna Conference this time, it further implies that Germany and Italy's expectations of Japan and the collusion between them have reached a new stage due to the evolution of the European and Asian situation. At present, the entire future of the South Pacific remains to be determined, and all parties need to pay close attention. The precariousness of Saigon and the overall situation in Vietnam is no different from that of northern Vietnam two months ago. Hopefully, it will not become a continuation of northern Vietnam due to the lack of vigilance of the countries concerned.</p>
<h3>Construction in Yunnan to be Shown in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Yunnan Province Chairman Long Yun once gave a speech regarding welcoming overseas Chinese to invest in Yunnan and develop Fuyuan. The gist of the speech was that Yunnan has extremely rich resources and urgently hopes that overseas Chinese who care about the motherland will invest in and develop them for the benefit of the country. At that time, the Central Film Studio recorded the speech on location. Afterwards, cinematographers from China Film Studio went to various places in Yunnan Province to capture scenery of rich resources and famous landmarks, as well as new constructions, etc. The filming took many months and the footage obtained was extremely rich and used to be inserted into the speech. Recently, the entire project has been completed and named "Construction in Yunnan". It will be premiered in this city in the coming days. Currently, overseas Chinese groups in various regions of Southeast Asia, upon hearing that the studio has produced this film, have been sending telegrams to order the rights to screen it.

<p>Pacific Fleet to be Established Soon</p>
<p>Moscow – Regarding the Soviet submarine force, news reports commented, "The first Soviet submarine was built ten years ago. At that time, efforts were made to improve it, and as a result, Soviet submarines are superior to those of other countries in terms of tactics and technology. In 1931, the Soviet authorities decided to rapidly add a large number of submarines in the Far East. At the same time, the construction of submarines in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea was also continuing. Thus, the collective production plan for submarines was successfully completed. The Soviet Union's powerful Pacific submarine fleet was also established in a short period, greatly enhancing the maritime defense of eastern Soviet Union. Since then, the Soviet Pacific Fleet has been growing daily. The Soviet Union's powerful submarine fleet was established in the second five-year plan. As for the current third five-year plan, the Soviet Union will build an incredibly powerful navy. Soviet industry is currently manufacturing submarines in large quantities, and all machinery is domestically produced. As a result, the Soviet submarine fleet has become one of the most powerful fleets in the world, no less impressive than the world's largest fleets." (20th Dispatch from TASS)</p>

<p>Developments in the Balkans, Turkey is Deeply Wary</p>
<p>Istanbul – Since receiving news that leader Hitler had met with King Boris of Bulgaria, there is deep fear that the war may immediately extend to the Turkish border. Authoritative sources say that, to save face, Italy may not need Germany to assist in the war against Greece. Therefore, Germany may force Bulgaria to intervene in the Italian-Greek war to assist Italy.

Authoritative sources also say that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen's return here may be related to this matter. (20th Dispatch from United Press)</p>

<p>Bulgaria Joins the Axis, Still Does Not Forget Territorial Demands</p>
<p>Sofia – Bulgarian newspapers are now continuing to advocate for obtaining access to the Aegean Sea and recovering Western Thrace. "Duma" newspaper stated that Bulgaria is prepared to negotiate these goals through peaceful means and restore Greek-Bulgarian friendship. The newspapers all published the news of King Boris's visit to Hitler in large characters, but did not offer criticism. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>London – It is rumored that King Boris told Hitler in Berchtesgaden that he would allow German troops to pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece. Therefore, there are now five fully equipped German divisions in Bulgaria, and it is expected that a blitzkrieg will be launched against Greece within 48 hours. Bulgarian sources in London recently denied the above statement, saying that there are no German troops in Bulgaria. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>German-Spanish Negotiations Concluded, Agreement Soon to be Signed</p>
<p>Basel – The Swiss "Basler Zeitung" reports from Rome that Spain and the Axis powers are expected to sign a definitive agreement in the coming days, leading to "activities of some kind." Roman political circles believe that the discussions between the two sides have now concluded, and the situation will soon develop. Furthermore, the newspaper's Berlin dispatch stated that German officials are adhering to the army, led by Soner, while informed sources said that the negotiations with Spain have now concluded. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Hitler's Efforts, Difficult to Reconcile Soviet-Spanish Relations</p>
<p>London – The "Daily News" editorial is titled "Hitler's Two Faces", saying that Hitler, after just expressing goodwill to Molotov, hastily invited the Spanish Foreign Minister to visit Berchtesgaden, which is very awkward. There is obviously something suspicious in this. Hitler's anti-communism is just a propaganda technique, and the truth has now been revealed. Spain is not like this, and its anti-communism is more genuine. How can Hitler's flirtation with Moscow be reconciled with his friendship with Spain? This is a question that Spain cannot help but ask. Even if Hitler reconnects with Soner about Spain's assistance to Germany in attacking Britain, the meeting between Mr. Xi and General Franco last month did not produce any effect, so this decision to reconnect should also be invalid. Not to mention the German-Soviet talks, the loss of the Italian battleship in Taranto and the defeat of the Italian army in the war against Greece cannot make Spain easily believe Mr. Xi's sweet words, not to mention that there is now reason to believe that powerful figures in Spain, including military leaders, are now eager to avoid war. "The Times" foreign correspondent commented on Western Foreign Minister Soner's visit to Germany, saying that Hitler seems willing to reiterate to General Franco that Germany's invitation to Molotov has no ideological significance, but is only a strategy to help win the war. Will Mr. Xi fulfill his previous promise to cede French North African territory to expand the territory of Italy and Spain, or has the request of Italy and Spain been abandoned when discussing with Marshal Pétain? It seems that the two governments in Italy and Spain cannot help but doubt this. When Molotov visited Germany, Germany seemed to promise to provide the Soviet Union with technical assistance to help it build a navy and promised not to attack Turkey at present, in exchange for the Soviet Union's supply of aircraft parts.

<p>Washington – A spokesman for the US Treasury Department stated yesterday that he had never heard of rumors at home and abroad that the United States would freeze Chinese deposits in the United States, and solemnly declared that the US Treasury Department had no knowledge of this measure. It is said that the US President believes that he can order the immediate freezing of funds of any foreign country deposited in the US when necessary, etc. Recently, some non-official parties have advocated that the US freeze deposits of foreign countries other than the Western Hemisphere, so as to contain the aggressor countries, but a licensing system should still be applied so that the funds needed by China and the UK can still be released. However, the State Department announced last night that the department was not aware of any plans related to this matter. The origin of this statement should be an essay published in a newspaper, but the essay was not based on official opinions. (20th Dispatch from United Press Agency)</p>

<p>Nazi Night Hawks Raid Britain on a Large Scale, Midland District Suffers Frenzied Bombing, Bombs Rain Down for Nine Hours, Coventry Tragedy Repeated</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that last night German aircraft attacked the Midland district of Britain with a major focus. The scale was very large, starting after nightfall and continuing for nine hours. Many incendiary and high-explosive bombs were dropped, causing considerable damage in several districts, with several major fires, all of which have been brought under control. Housing and other buildings in one district were severely damaged, but damage elsewhere was not serious. Detailed reports have not yet arrived. There must be some casualties, but in terms of the scale of the offensive, the number of casualties is relatively small. Bombs also fell in several other places in Britain, including the London area and the Suloran district. The attacks on London were not large-scale, but intermittent throughout the night, with slight material damage and limited casualties. Losses in other places were minor, with very few casualties. At least five enemy bombers were shot down last night. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>London – From last night until this morning, German aircraft concentrated on attacking the Midlands. After a town suffered a heavy, torrential-storm-like attack for ten hours, another town in the same area was attacked again using the same means as the recent bombing of Coventry. One team after another of attackers flew lower than usual, and after crossing the East Anglian coast, they indiscriminately dropped bombs of various forms and calibers in the area. A certain town suffered particularly severely, and another town, which had recently suffered a tragedy, was attacked for the second time yesterday. Up to two towns were "blessed" with a large number of fire bombs, causing countless major fires. Firefighters wearing helmets were struggling to put out the fires as bombs and shells rained down. Throughout the area from the east coast to the Midlands, anti-aircraft fire was dense and continuous, forming almost a huge curtain of fire, causing most of the attackers' formations to be scattered, and many were forced to unload their bombs among rural huts, but these places suffered very little damage. The alarm in London was lifted at 7:00 a.m. today, an hour earlier than usual. (20th Dispatch from Taiwan Public News)</p>
<p>Berlin – Last night, a large force of German aircraft, departing late at night from bases in France, Belgium, Holland Valley, launched a large-scale attack on the town of Birmingham in the Midlands this morning. In a sunny and breezy atmosphere, waves of German aircraft continuously flew over the city, dropping thousands of various bombs on military factories, other military targets, and public utilities. The entire city was shrouded in more than twenty major fires. Later aircraft used the raging fire as a target, so there was no difficulty in finding their destination. The effectiveness of anti-aircraft artillery was very small. In addition, London and southern cities were heavily bombed by German aircraft. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Coventry after the Bombing, Tragic Situation, Historical City Becomes Ruins, Victims Buried in Cemetery</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – According to a London dispatch carried in the "Aftonbladet", thick smoke still fills the entire city of the British industrial city of Coventry. It is impossible to determine how many fires there are. The city is almost completely in ruins, like an earthquake. Large groups of men, women, old people, and children are waiting for medical treatment in front of the hospitals. Ambulances are injecting typhoid fever prevention vaccines everywhere, and drinking water must be boiled before it can be taken. According to Production Minister Morrison, the rubble in the city has been demolished by soldiers, and there is no danger of walking under it. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)</p>
<p>London – The remains of the people who died in the heavy bombing of Coventry last week will be transported by a convoy of trucks covered with the national flag at 11 a.m. today to be buried in the local cemetery to form a public tomb. When peace is restored, an appropriate monument will be built on the tomb. The work of clearing the rubble is still in progress, and bodies will be unearthed, so the number of victims will increase. The people whose homes have been destroyed have received sympathy and financial assistance from all parties and have been given arrangements. The Chairman of the London County Council, Tavio, telegraphed the elders of Kirk and Terry, saying, "I extend my deep sympathy to all of you and the citizens of the historic city of Coventry. The people of London express their respect to your proud spirit and courage. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help." The British ship "Coventry Command." also sent a telegram saying, "All the officers and soldiers of the Coventry express their deep sympathy for the suffering of the residents of Coventry, and assure them that this ship will definitely make the enemy suffer this too." Coventry has received many other letters and telegrams, with attached checks, such as a contribution of one million pounds from the Mayor of London. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Bomb Berlin Center, German Industrial Production Greatly Affected</p>
<p>New York – According to news from the German capital, British aircraft bombed the center of Berlin last night. The nature and extent of the damage was not stated, only that a hospital and several residences were hit. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>London – The Information Office of the British Air Ministry announced today that the Krupp Munitions Factory in Essen, the largest in Germany, has had its output halved due to an air strike by the US Air Force. Some parts of the factory have been closed, and other parts cannot be relocated, and many railway junctions have been damaged, making transportation difficult, so it is very difficult to obtain raw materials on time. One part of the factory was hit by a bomb and lost its working ability, and a particularly heavy giant bomb penetrated an underground factory and exploded. According to news received by the United Kingdom, the repeated heavy attacks on cities in western Germany by the British Air Force have caused increasingly serious obstacles to industry.

<p>Painful History of the European War (3), Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy</p>
<p>(2) Gamelin, Who Could See But Not Do</p>
<p>My conversation with Gamelin involved returning to Belgium for a trip. I asked him about the German offensive he had just mentioned, whether it would come via Belgium.</p>
<p>He said: "This is very likely. But we must also consider that the enemy may not only attack Holland and Belgium, but launch a full-scale attack from the mouth of the Rhine to the Swiss border."</p>
<p>I asked: "When does the commander think the German army will begin its offensive?"</p>
<p>He bit his lip and thought for a moment before answering: "The end of January? I don't think so. Mid-March is closer." He pondered for a while, changed his tone, and said: "May, yes, May is almost certainly certain." He made this amazing prediction, still calm and composed, which surprised me. General Gamelin seemed to have the future development clearly in his mind, not taking it lightly, but at least not fearing it. If what he said is true, wouldn't it be a great fortune for France to catch up quickly and do its best to replenish the air force during this period of calm on the Western Front?</p>
<p>He said calmly and firmly: "Yes, by mid-March our preparations will just reach the standard."</p>
<p>I continued: "Speaking of tanks, the Belgian side told me that they have the most excellent anti-tank guns." Gamelin replied: "That's right."</p>
<p>There was a clock hanging on the wall, and I had been staring at it. Now I look at the clock and know that I have been there for an hour and ten minutes. During the conversation, I repeatedly expressed that I should not disturb him, but Gamelin always waved his hand and said: "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, you haven't disturbed me at all."</p>
<p>During this hour and ten minutes, the phone never rang, and there was not even a knock on the door. It was really quiet all around. Finally, I excused myself and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Before leaving, he smiled slightly and said: "Of course, you will keep what you see and hear on the front line a secret and not reveal it. We'll see you again when we come back. We'll be happy to hear any advice."</p>
<p>I returned from inspecting the front line on the night of the 24th. I thought that instead of directly asking Gamelin to take the time to meet, it would be better to write him a brief report to imply a request to meet. I am an amateur in military affairs, and it is inevitable that I will be ridiculed if I talk nonsense, so I tried to be careful in my wording, and used a tactful style to reveal my opinions between the lines. But there were really a lot of shortcomings that I saw, and Gamelin was the best person to correct these shortcomings in France. Therefore, I ventured to urge him to pay attention in the report.</p>
<p>For example, regarding the first line of defense, I said: "There are too few shelters for defense against bombing, and there are no trenches that can be used as shelters, which is surprising. I asked the officers how to do it at that time. They said that they... have forests, drill holes, or lie in low-lying areas."</p>
<p>Regarding the Maginot Line, I said: "Just by paying a little attention, people who slightly look at the outer line will feel that it is not satisfactory. The tank traps seem too hasty, and the trenches are too few. Although the barbed wire obstacles have not been neglected, their depth and length are still not enough.</p>
<p>Regarding the main forts of the defense line: "Although I am not proficient in this field, and what I have seen is only superficial, I have to say: I am afraid that the power of the fort's fire network is not enough to match the solid and magnificent steel and concrete works. The effectiveness of this kind of well-protected giant cannon is far from comparable to field artillery. If the enemy launches a full-scale attack, whether it can control the front and sides with a dense and wide fire network, making it difficult for them to cross the minefield, it is not without doubt."</p>
<p>I also mentioned the army generals' complaints about the air force, and that the life of the troops close to the front was not tense enough, which was dangerous. Although the tone of my report was very humble, a discerning person like Gamelin should not have found it difficult to understand the great significance of my implication." He did not reply to this report, nor did he invite me to meet, and there was no chance to see him again from then on.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about Gamelin's merits and demerits. After the disaster struck, some people attacked Gamelin for his muddling through and delaying the military opportunity, which shows that they were talking nonsense and did not know what they were talking about. Laineau said at the end of May that what was lacking was intellectual application. The implication was that he intended to replace Gamelin, but what he said was not realistic. On the whole, Gamelin had a wise head and did not speculate out of thin air. He spoke about strategy and tactics, all of which were pertinent, and the subsequent developments were especially in line with the reality.</p>
<p>Some people also said: "Gamelin's rapid rise was entirely due to flattery and good flattery, and entirely due to the promotion of politicians and bureaucrats." These people do not know that if a soldier wants to be promoted to a high position, he must rely on politicians. Their military value has not been diminished as a result. Isn't Napoleon's success due to his efforts to win over politicians? Are the German generals now invincible because of politics? But we have to go a step further and say that the selection of generals is best decided by non-military politicians, and should not allow people in the military to block the road for talented people, so that genius cannot show itself. Was it politicians or soldiers who buried Bestergor's talents?</p>
<p>Or it can be said that although Gamelin predicted the situation in mid-May, he did not move his troops, so the troops under his command were waiting to die, and he could not be blamed. Although he confided in me and talked for more than an hour, I was not afraid of criticism and pointed out to him the situation on the front line, which was not very satisfactory. Although it was a euphemistic suggestion, it still made him feel unhappy.</p>
<p>I think the following comments may not be far from the truth. This person must have great intelligence. His ideas do not like to be changed easily, and he even tries to avoid any environment that may change his ideas. It is said that he does not often inspect the front line, and it is rare to go to the military zone. As the commander of the Allied forces, his footprints never leave the residences of Weissenburg and Tarati. He also travels between London and Chiksenburg for the meetings of the Supreme Military Council of the Allied forces in London. His staying at home is definitely not due to fear of any danger, nor can it be said that he is due to mental fatigue. Perhaps he is afraid of trouble and afraid of discovering unpleasant things.</p>
<p>There are many people whose intelligence and ability to act are too disproportionate, and Gamelin is one such person! What is the reason? The first is the lack of willpower. This kind of person only has thoughts, but no determination to carry them out. This kind of person is afraid of action, and even more afraid of the consequences of action. Herleau has already said this with emotion, and the bureaucratic atmosphere in the General Staff has made him even more lazy to act.</p>
<p>This kind of person is fundamentally a visionary. It is well known that visionaries often have very clear thoughts.</p>
<p>For example, a visionary engineer dreams day and night about how to build gorgeous houses and mansions. They have thought of everything in terms of construction, only forgetting the one thing they must do, which is to take action.</p>
<p>It is rare in the world for a visionary to become the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army and the Commander of the Allied Forces. He dreams of tanks, but does not care about the reality of the small number of tanks; he also dreams of a blitzkrieg that will happen in May, but does not know how to deal with it, making it difficult for the enemy to win and seizing victory in his own hands, which is too sad.

<p>Free Talk	Jesus as Lord of My Heart (5) (5) Jesus - Lord of Affections: (Jesus.Lordof the Affectlons) People's hearts are the most sacred thing, and that is love. Proverbs 4:23: "Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life." Many people have experienced failure in life because they use their emotions improperly or on unworthy things. The crisis of life is never as important as when love is revealed. It is also the hub of life. A person's happiness in life is determined by the relationships that arise from love. In this light, honoring Christ as the Lord of Love is indeed a pressing matter. "Devoutly dedicate my heart, belonging to the Lord, worthy to be the Lord's abode;" We must never let love run wild, indulging in desires and doing whatever we want. Always take Christ as the scope of using emotions, and honor Him as Lord in everything. No one in the world has loved us like He has, and no one has shown such love as He has. Each of us can say, "The Son of God loved me and gave Himself for me." We should respond to this great love with true devotion and a willing heart. In our view, true love has three conditions: (1) Adoration: Psalm 73:25 says, "Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you." God likes us to adore Him. We should learn from the prophet Isaiah, who said, "Your name and renown are the desire of our hearts" (Isaiah 26:8). (2) Delight: Love must have an object of delight. God delights in his own people, so every one of God's people can say, "He rescued me because he delighted in me" (Psalm 18:19). So we delight in him, as the Psalmist says, "Take delight in the Lord" (Psalm 37:4). (3) Dedication: If a person's love is compiled by Jesus, he should devoutly dedicate himself and be happy to serve the Lord. With the love of Jesus, we should not live only for ourselves, but for the Lord who died and rose again for us. In this way, there will be no misuse of emotions, and no wandering aimlessly in love. Their love will be sacred and controlled by Jesus.

<p>Night Shift Work Stirring</p>
<p>Five weeks of night shift life have passed, and this should be the last week. For the sake of work and responsibility, I always have to find ways to make myself feel very interested and hopeful when I am on duty at night.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock, as usual, we started our work under the red light. The ward was immersed in darkness, except for the moans of a patient in bed number sixteen with a broken leg. The most agitated patient with ruptured peritonitis had died during the day.</p>
<p>In the dim light of the flashlight, I tidied up the beds for the patients, added blankets, and made the patients close their eyes. Then, I followed the doctor's orders and prepared hot compresses, gave medicines, gave food, wiped backs, and other treatments.</p>
<p>Around eleven o'clock, I finished these things, and it was time for dinner. Another classmate replaced me in the ward. When I was eating, I wanted to make myself more excited, but it seemed a little impossible. The food seemed to have turned bitter, and even the things I liked to eat during the day, I now found annoying.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, the ward was even quieter. I had to move more lightly beside the beds, carefully pulling the blankets up to the patients' bodies. All twenty patients slept very well, and even the patient with the broken leg in bed number sixteen was fast asleep because he had taken sleeping pills. The patients no longer asked me for water or helped them turn over. I had to sit down at my desk too.</p>
<p>The dim light was weakly shining. I picked up a book on nursing ethics, preparing to flip through it. After reading it for half an hour, my eyes began to blur, and I couldn't remember what I had read. After walking around the ward once, I sat down again, afraid that the sound of my footsteps would wake the patients.</p>
<p>The pendulum of the clock outside the room seemed particularly harsh tonight. The night was passing too slowly. If I were still doing the day shift now, I certainly wouldn't want the night to be longer. Sleep is sweet. Those who have done the night shift will appreciate this. However, I knew very well that sweetness should not be mine. I should guard, guard! No matter how deep and beautiful the temptation of this night is.</p>
<p>I stood up, wiping my eyes. I tried desperately to focus my eyes on each patient. I hoped they would move slightly, and I wanted them to ask for water, even if they coughed once, as long as it could invigorate my spirit, nothing would bother me. But, they didn't do that. They all slept very well.</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the morning, I sat down to write the report, and then prepared to write the diary. The light seemed dimmer than before, and I had a strange feeling in my heart. Thinking that I only slept for five and a half hours during the day (because I had to get up for class at three thirty in the afternoon), I felt even more exhausted and unable to support myself. I gradually fell into a daze. Was I asleep? I couldn't believe it, but I had to believe it, because my pen told me - I was dozing off - it was no longer in my hand, it fell on the ground, and the nib was crushed by my foot. I felt terrified. I started to get confused. I was afraid that the patient in bed number two had taken out the drainage tube from the wound, and I was even more afraid that the patient in bed number six had loosened the bandage. After checking on them, I realized that my fantasies were wrong.</p>
<p>It was almost dawn, and the patients were still sleeping quietly. A ray of light shone through the horizon. I was very clear-headed. An inexplicable feeling violently attacked me. Why did I actually fall asleep? I began to hate myself - I hated my head, eyes, hands, feet - as long as it was a part of my body, I hated it, because they made me do the most painful thing - made me doze off. I didn't want to do this, but I did it unconsciously. I knew how dangerous this was for the patients, I knew my job and mission. But, could I completely hate myself? No, it was this system of eleven hours of night work and five and a half hours of daytime sleep that made us like this. However, I shouldn't hate anyone. In the struggle to win national liberation, we should work even harder. However, excessive fatigue will hinder work.</p>
<p>For the sake of the patients, for the sake of the hospital, I hope that the people in charge of every hospital can change the night shift hours so that we can fulfill our responsibilities, and I also hope that people who are enthusiastic about serving the public will constantly give us pure guidance and criticism so that the future of the entire nursing profession will turn towards a bright path!</p>

<h3>Hawthorne's Detective Work The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen by Cheng Xiaoqing</h3>
<p>Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>Hawthorne continued, "Why are you staring blankly like that? When we first saw Wang Lilan's body this morning, didn't you make a correct judgment? You said it looked like a knife wound. Yes, it was a knife wound. The width of the wound is obvious evidence. Also, when the bullet passed through her back, the hole in her back was small, and there wasn't much blood, which also showed that the bullet wasn't fatal. There was no doubt about that. How could you forget?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Yes, I had the impression of a knife wound at a glance, but Ni Jinshou immediately corrected me and said it was a gunshot wound; at the same time, he explained that everyone in the house heard the gunshot, and there was also a bullet that he pried out of the wall, which did pass through Wang Lilan's chest, and it just so happened to pass through the same wound. Therefore, I became confused and didn't dare to insist on my preconceived notions."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, the complexity of this case lies in this point - in this double murder. In fact, if it were a simple shooting, then the theft of Wang Lilan's jewelry would be unexplainable. It was impossible to rob her beforehand, because she didn't scream. She would never let people take away her beloved jewelry without resistance. It was also impossible to steal it afterward, because time didn't allow it. We already discussed it this morning. So this is obviously a double murder case. Once you think about it, you know that the jewelry must have been stolen at the moment of the assassination, before the shooting. Your opinion obviously has international evidence, it wasn't produced out of thin air, you don't need to doubt yourself."</p>
<p>"So, you also believed that Wang Lilan died from a knife wound long ago."</p>
<p>"Yes - I also assumed that the real murderer might be in that house. However, because of the 'Type A' leather shoe prints, I hesitated a bit and didn't dare to decide for a while."</p>
<p>"Then, why didn't you start with the people in the house more quickly? Instead, you wasted effort circling around outside?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne smiled and said, "What? Circling around? Wasting effort? Bao Lang, how can you say such a thing? Don't you know that the superficial phenomenon of this case, the gun problem, is more important than the stabbing problem? And the person who shot her, although they couldn't really kill Lilan, still had the intention of murder. The person who shot her came from outside, involving many people, and the relationship is very complicated. How could I not deal with the urgent matters first, clear the periphery, and bring out the protagonist of the second murder?"</p>
<p>I was silent for a moment, took two puffs of smoke, and then said, "Since you suspected from the beginning that the person who stabbed the dancing queen to death was someone in the house, did you know that the murderer was that old man Li Zhiban?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly frowned, slowly exhaled two puffs of smoke, shook his head, and said, "I didn't dare to make a rash judgment. Because the materials I initially obtained were not enough to fully understand what motives he had. Of course, I can't draw conclusions based on ideals alone." (172)</p>

Mr. Lang Jingshan is the first Chinese photographer to win international honors, and Mr. Xu is the second. A.R.A.R.P.S. is the abbreviation of Art Proficiency Member of the Royal Photographic Society of England. (Editor)</p>
<p>Writing is not what I am afraid of, but recently, I have been encouraged by fellow photography enthusiasts, who often come to discuss everything, which seems to have inspired my long-hidden thoughts of hiding my clumsiness. So, regardless of whether it is good or bad, I will write this article to study with my comrades, and I hope readers will give me advice.</p>
<p>The question is often mentioned regarding the skills, so I will first talk about this issue. The skills of photography are discussed from two aspects: one is the use of the camera, and the other is the choice of angle and the adoption of light. If the reader can put in some effort and have a considerable understanding of these two aspects, it will naturally not be difficult to construct a photograph of contemporary art.</p>
<p>The structure of the camera has progressed to a very subtle point. Although we only need to spend a considerable price to get the most sophisticated camera into our hands, if we do not train the camera's aperture and shutter to be as proficient as training our own eyes, opening and closing at will, then we will not be able to use the mysteries of the camera freely.</p>
<p>The shutter and aperture in the camera function like human eyes; to train them to be as proficient as our own eyes in observing objects, we should use the camera's shutter from the fastest to the slowest, and each kind of speed. Use several decisions on the subject being photographed at the same time to make a comparison. With this comparison, you will know the character of the shutter's speed. Then, record and compare from the finest point of the aperture to the largest point, so that you can boldly use its most suitable character to capture the subject under different circumstances. Usually, there is a habit of only using F.11 for distant scenes and F.8 for close-ups. Although the camera is equipped with F.22 and F.4 apertures, most people dare not try them; this is because they do not know the expression of its character. Taking photos with such experience is really a bit of a disappointment for such a sophisticated camera.</p>
<p>Like these days when the sun is weak, outdoor photography only needs to use a larger aperture (below F.8) to take beautiful photos, and it will never be bad; on the contrary, in summer, when the sun is too strong, making people unable to open their eyes, you have to close your upper and lower eyelids tightly, leaving only a slit, to be able to see the distance, you must not stubbornly use F.11 to shoot distant scenes, and F.8 to shoot close-ups: naturally, you also have to let only a little bit of the lens show, boldly using F.22 for distant scenes, and F.16 for close-ups; if the subject or background is white or other colors, and the sunlight reflects back into the eyes, you should use an even smaller aperture. The application of the shutter is to help the aperture collect light. Its use is like the opening and closing of the eyes. Between this opening and closing, the speed must be moderate.</p>

<p>Hu Die is Still Safe and Sound in Hong Kong Hai Xing</p>
<p>Various Rumors are Completely Groundless</p>
<p>(Hong Kong News) An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 11th said: Film queen Hu Die died of dystocia in Shanghai last night (the 10th). This morning (the 11th) at around ten o'clock, the reporter visited Hu Die and talked with her for a long time. Hu was as healthy as usual, and she also had no childbirth. Hu Die also described her recent situation as follows:</p>
<p>It is true that a certain company asked me to make a movie, and we have discussed it several times. As for which company it is, I have not decided yet, and I do not want to make it public before it is a done deal. The reporter also asked if she was still interested in acting life? Ms. Hu said: I still have the same enthusiasm as when I first entered the film industry and am not tired of it. However, as times progress, movies also progress. The backward phenomenon of early movies is similar to the current situation, but I believe it will not last long, so I will be especially cautious about filming in the future. She also said that it is rumored in Shanghai that she has gone to the Philippines, but in fact, she has not left Hong Kong for a single step, but she did have this opportunity but it did not materialize.</p>
<p>The reporter asked about the Shanghai Xinhua Company's preparation to produce "Yang Guifei" in Shanghai, starring Chen Yunshang, Ms. Hu informed that because she was unwilling to go to Shanghai, Xinhua would have to change people, and said that Chen Yunshang's acting path is very broad, so she is competent.</p>
<p>Hu Die's weight has decreased, and her appearance has not diminished, and she herself still seems to dislike being too fat, and is still trying to diet to achieve an ideal healthy and beautiful physique.</p>
<p>Dress Rehearsal (1) The Shanghai Leshan Association is raising funds for sending winter clothes, and launched a recreational assembly, inviting famous amateur and professional opera performers to perform Peking opera. Today, it will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association.

<h3>Adopting a Strong Policy Towards the Far East: U.S. Determined to Prevent Japan's Southern Advance; Roosevelt Earnestly Appeals for Labor Unity; Many Professors Advocate Expanding Aid to China</h3>
<p>Washington - Administration officials recently acknowledged that the recent U.S. election is a harbinger of a strong U.S. policy towards the Far East, saying that the U.S. appears poised to resist any new Japanese attempts to advance southward. Official and non-official individuals are closely studying news and reports from China, Vietnam, and Japan. There have been numerous rumors and indications from China, Vietnam, and Japan suggesting that Japan will take military action towards the South. Military authorities generally believe that the Japanese army's withdrawal from Southern China and concentration of troops and supplies on Hainan Island are the prelude to military or diplomatic maneuvers in the South China Sea. Experts say that Japan's primary objective at this time must be Saigon or Borneo. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>New Orleans - President Roosevelt asked the nation's labor force to unite for the sake of national interests, and not to divide into factions. Last night, the President took the opportunity of the resignation of Mr. Lewis, head of the Industrial Organizations Congress, and sent a message to the American Federation of Labor, advocating that the labor movement should seek fair and honorable peace, and emphatically called for a great unified democracy to meet the needs of any events that the country will encounter. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Boston - The Dean of Harvard Law School and fifteen Harvard professors recently published an article in the December issue of the "Atlantic Monthly," advocating that the United States take strong steps to deter Japan's expansionist plans in the South Pacific. According to the professors' proposal, the United States should declare a complete ban on commercial exchanges with Japan and expand all possible material assistance to the Chongqing National Government. Furthermore, the U.S. should reach an agreement with the British and Dutch governments so that the U.S. can use naval bases in the South Pacific. The original text stated: "Britain, America, and the Netherlands should jointly use their naval bases in the Far East. If Japan attacks the United States or invades Singapore or the Dutch East Indies, the three countries can impose a complete naval blockade." The article also stated that if the United States cannot take action quickly in the Pacific, the Soviet Union may join Japan in dividing China, and the Near East, which supports Britain's resistance, will also be discouraged. Moreover, Mexico and the South American countries will inevitably see the appeasement policy as the only safe path. Therefore, if the United States allows Japan to use Annam as a base to conquer China and absorb all of Asia's resources, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is noted that the professors who authored this article were led by Landis, the Dean of Harvard Law School. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Japanese Raw Silk: U.S. Bans Imports</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. Maritime Commission yesterday ordered nine shipping companies, including six Japanese shipping companies such as Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Mitsui &amp; Co., to immediately stop transporting raw silk into the United States by falsely claiming it to be cotton or other raw materials. The committee pointed out that the shipping companies deliberately turned a blind eye to the true type of goods they were loading, because if they truthfully stated on the manifest that the goods were silk, it would cause losses to the shipping companies' business.

<p>Tokyo - Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi recently stated that due to the European war and the increasingly tense international situation, the economic pressure from the U.S. and Britain on Japan is also intensifying. He also said that the U.S. not only prohibits the export of gasoline and machinery to Japan, but also prohibits the export of scrap iron. Although the U.S. does not change its embargo policy, Japan has guaranteed to have the necessary supplies to maintain its simple living standards and maintain its national strength to cope with war.

<h3>Japan Aims to Avoid War with U.S.: Observations of a Philippine Expert</h3>
<p>Washington - Filipino economist Villamin said that Japan might adopt methods to avoid going to war with the U.S. in order to fulfill its obligations to the German-Italian Axis. He also stated that his remarks were purely personal opinions and did not represent the Philippine government. He has served in parliamentary, business, and academic circles, analyzing and commenting on the Far East issues concerning the Philippines. His remarks were briefly as follows: "I believe that as a result of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, a U.S.-Japan war is probably even less likely than before. Japan's responsibilities to the alliance are: (1) to create obstacles for the United States, preventing it from assisting Britain in the Atlantic, and (2) to disrupt British colonies in the Pacific. The reward that Germany and Italy promised Japan at the time must have been the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, or a part of these two territories, just like they rewarded the Soviet Union with half of Poland a year ago. However, today's Japan has no excuse to occupy the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. Germany, on the other hand, can argue that it has conquered France and the Netherlands and therefore has the right to govern the territories of France and the Netherlands. At this time, Japan can fulfill its alliance obligations without having to go to war with the U.S. Japan knows that it gains much more by maintaining peace with the U.S. and loses much more by going to war with the U.S., and knows that if it fights the U.S., it will inevitably suffer resistance from both the manpower of China and the material and military resources of the U.S. Moreover, the cost of the war against China has already been huge, and German-Italian assistance is unlikely. For this reason, it will be difficult for Japan and the U.S. to go to war. Even if war breaks out, the culprit will not be the alliance of the totalitarian powers." (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Construction of Sino-American Warships: Sudden Fire; Seven Injured, Minor Losses; One Destroyer Also Damaged Due to Carelessness</h3>
<p>New York - The 35,000-ton battleship "South Dakota," under construction at the Camden shipyard, and the destroyer "Gwin," under construction at the Boston shipyard, both suddenly caught fire yesterday. The cause of the former's fire was said to be spontaneous combustion, while the latter was caused by the molten metal used by a riveter. Seven people were slightly injured and one person was seriously injured in the "South Dakota" fire. The fire burned for twenty minutes, and the losses were minor, but there was a risk that the other twenty ships being built in the same shipyard would be affected. The fire on the "Gwin" also burned for thirty minutes. This was the second fire in the Boston shipyard in three days. The previous fire was a careless fire in the shipyard warehouse on Saturday.

<h3>Japan to Continue Negotiations with Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Today, the Foreign Ministry spokesman replied to a question from a foreign news reporter, saying that the agreement signed by the Mitsui &amp; Co. directors and the representatives of the Batavia oil companies and the negotiations between the Japanese and Dutch East Indies governments are two completely different matters. The agreement does not represent an agreement between the two governments, so we will continue our negotiations with the Dutch East Indies authorities. The spokesperson declined to disclose the contents of the agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui and Huang Xuchu Plan to Revive Southern Guangxi; Huang to Go to Longzhou to Direct Refugee Relief; Zhang Has Ordered 20,000 Dan of Rice to Be Shipped to Nanning</h3>
<p>Nanning - Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi Province, have planned to revive the Southern Guangxi area. Chairman Huang will soon go to Longzhou to direct refugee relief. General Zhang has ordered 20,000 dan of rice to be shipped to Nanning. Chairman Huang told a United Press reporter that he has requested a central government appropriation of 4 million yuan for relief. In addition, 1 million yuan will be raised in Guangxi Province. One-third of the residents of Nanning have returned to the city, and 20% of the shops have reopened. Schools in Nanning are being prepared for restoration. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>National Government Relief: Food for the Poor</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government's Food Bureau is currently seeking ways to cope with the current high rice prices. It has ordered the National Food Administration to prepare rice and supply it to government employees and the poor at the prescribed price, and will set up offices to provide rice relief to the poorest and most destitute. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to the Deputy Director of the National Agricultural Research Bureau today, the food produced in Sichuan Province is sufficient to supply 51 million residents with a surplus. The current soaring food prices are not due to poor harvests, but are caused by hoarding and speculation. It is found that Sichuan Province produces 140 million shi of rice, 36 million dan of wheat, 28 million dan of barley, and 53 million dan of sweet potatoes each year. The annual consumption is only 130 million shi of rice, 33 million dan of wheat, 29 million dan of barley, and 49 million dan of sweet potatoes. Therefore, Sichuan Province still has a surplus of 15 million dan of grain each year. Sichuan Province had a bumper agricultural harvest last year, so the National Government implemented a grain purchasing program to alleviate the difficulties of farmers and to store military grain, but the remaining rice is still sufficient to feed the people until the end of September next year.

<h3>Detailed Measures for Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices in Hunan</h3>
<p>Changsha - Since the implementation of the price stabilization movement in Hunan Province, the people have been very happy. In order to make this movement easier to promote and to better balance the interests of producers, consumers, and merchants, Chairman Xue has specially stipulated detailed measures, which were telegraphed to the whole province for uniform compliance on the 19th: (1) The price of locally produced grain and rice in each county shall still be in accordance with previous regulations. The highest price shall not exceed seven yuan per shi of millet and fifteen yuan per shi of rice. (2) For counties and cities that are not self-sufficient in grain, those that transport grain from other places shall be permitted to add freight charges based on the distance of the grain source, subject to verification and approval by the county price evaluation committee. (3) In addition to grain and rice, for other daily necessities, in order to facilitate the implementation of price stabilization, the market price set in November of the 29th year shall be reduced in stages each month, with a reduction of one-tenth of the market price set in November of the 29th year on the 15th of each month. (4) It is strictly forbidden for people, merchants, and grain owners in each county to hide and not sell, or to hoard and speculate. Violators shall have their goods purchased and sold by the price evaluation committee at 90% of the prescribed price. (5) Work stoppages are absolutely prohibited, and serious offenders will be severely punished. (Dispatch of the 19th)</p>
