<h3 id="c7">近東和平柱石土耳其 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>本週國民政府行政院會議議決，任命張彭春氏爲中國駐土耳其公使。溯自賀耀祖氏返國以來，中國駐土使節，虛懸數載，現在有此任命，洵屬迅赴時宜。蓋土耳其之於國際，誠如張氏在渝對新聞記者發表談話所云；「土耳其非特爲地中海東部一大國，抑且爲國際局勢中最重要關鍵之一」。以張氏之博學多才，當能勝任愉快；而中國政府在積極抗戰之中，仍不懈於外交上之活動，尤値稱許。近來歐洲大局，日增緊張，挪威方面戰事暫告小小段落後，戰局發展，又有由北歐移向東南歐之趨勢，因此之故，愈益增加了土耳其的重要性。</p>
<p>土耳其本爲近東一大帝國，自從十八世紀以後，內則政敎腐敗，外則列强侵蝕，國　衰頽，日深一日。第一次歐戰時，土耳其助德奧以抗英法，兵敗，被迫訂立塞維爾條約，幾盡失小亞細亞以外之領土。但是土耳其的人民，終能在故總統基瑪爾氏領導之下，一戰而敗希臘，訂立洛桑和約，除巴勒斯丁，叙利亞，美索不達米亞，阿刺伯，埃及外，恢復其他舊領土，並廢除一切不平等條約；同時又努力革新內政，發展經濟，國勢蒸蒸日上，儼然成爲地中海東岸最强有力之領袖國家。</p>
<p>土耳其之復興，不但由於軍事上艱苦奮鬥，兼有賴於外交上圓滑運用。二十年來，土耳其之於一般國際，以維護和平爲其一貫之中心，故於一九二五年與蘇聯締結中立及相互保障條約，一九二八年與義大利締結友好仲裁條約，一九三四年又與希臘，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞諸國締結巴爾幹公約，以維持東南歐現狀，一九三七年更與伊拉克，伊朗，阿富汗諸國締結中東公約，以保障西亞之安全。一九三六年蒙德婁會議之結果，土耳其得將韃靼尼爾與博斯波魯斯兩海峽之武裝及統制權，收回之於樽俎之間，於是更增加其維護東歐和平之責任，及其國際地位上之重要性。</p>
<p>因此之故，去春德義兩國相繼以武力吞滅捷克斯拉夫與阿爾巴尼亞後，英法鑒於歐局之惡化，一面對羅馬尼亞希臘提供安全之保證，一面對土耳其即進行談判，結果英土談判成熟於五月，法土談判成熟於六月，而英法土三國互助公約，卒於十月十九日在土耳其首都簽字，其時歐陸大戰已經爆發月餘，而土耳其仍毅然與英法携手，準備共抗侵略。同時土耳其對於蘇聯之友誼，亦能始終維持不替；即對於德義，也未嘗斷然遂不假以辭色，但公然標揭其限度曰，巴爾幹各國之現狀須獲尊重而已。由此種種，可以覘知土耳其態度之勇敢，立塲之純正，外交之靈活，處處皆有優越之表現。夫歐洲東南一角，弱小林立，而今日猶未墮入戰神魔手之中，因緣叢脞，然土耳其隱然有一柱擎天之功者也。因爲德義諸國對於巴爾幹與近東，最所顧忌者莫如土耳其，而英法要履行其對希臘羅馬尼亞之安全保障，最所依賴者亦莫如土耳其，特別是英法海軍而欲駛抵羅馬尼亞港口，非通過土耳其兩海峽不可。今年三月杪，英法土三國高級代表舉行軍事會議於叙利亞之阿勒坡，對於一旦戰事擴大至近東時，三國應如何一致應付之措施，業經完全獲得妥協，由此可見土耳其維護近東和平信念之堅，洵可稱之爲近東和平柱石，實非過譽也。</p>
<p>歐洲戰局最近方在醞釀新變化之中。德軍在挪威方面，固有相當發展，然而僅此不足以消弭德國之困難，亦不足以滿償德國之需要：德國而欲進犯瑞典，則又不能不顧忌蘇聯。蘇聯瑞典間之經濟談判，現甫開始，此自某一角度觀之，雖視之蘇聯警告德國之一種外交姿態亦無不可。誠以德國之經濟困境，非打開不可；巴爾幹之富源，夙為德國所垂涎，是以在最近之將來，德國發展方向之將轉血東南歐，實屬極可能之趨勢。駐土德使巴本，昨方奉召返國；英法聯合艦隊，亦經開抵埃及；義國態度，仍未减其閃爍；凡此微妙之動態，皆得象徵近東風雲緊張日甚；而土耳其之措施如何，當然所關甚鉅，行見其瞬息之間，蔚爲全世界注視之中心焉。</p>
<p>中土兩國關係，具有悠久之淵源，血統極親，邦交素善；在此世界劇變之局，中國是遠東方面抵抗侵略之先鋒，土耳其則爲近東和平之柱石。我人爰於此張彭春氏受命使土，而推論土耳其與歐洲大局之關係如上。以今日科學之昌明，交通之便利，遂使和平不可分，世界成一體，中土兩國，雖然東西相隔，但其奮鬥之目標則同，企求之趨歸合一：果能携手共赴，當必更可提早成功之到來，則蒙其利者，又豈僅中土兩國而已。</p>

<p>中國北部產金的重要區域、過去雖有黑龍江省的漠河。黑河。綏芬河愛琿、吉林省的三念河·夾皮溝、遼寗省的鐵嶺·白樂溝·興安區、如今更知有熱河省的平泉·朝陽、河北省的興隆倒流水·遵化的馬蘭塔·密雲·昌平、山東省的招遠·沂水·臨沂等處、至於西南西北各省、產金的重要區域、則有四川省的松潘·綏靖、西康省的鹽源·冕寗·康定·道孚、靑海省的疊源樂都、湖南省的桃源·沅陵·平江、廣西省的上林·武鳴、其餘在各河江流域沿岸、如四川省的岷江·沱江·嘉陵江·大渡河·金沙江、雲南省的怒江·瀾滄江·金沙江、靑海省的大通河·惶河、陝西湖北兩省的漢水、河南省的丹江等各流域、多有沙金層發現、</p>

<p>四川省內多沙金鑛、散佈的區域非常廣、在松潘縣漳臘一帶、已劃定國營鑛區數處、從事探採、據統計所得、道里平均產量約每年爲二萬兩、</p>
<p>西康省內、也已在康定、泰寗·道孚·魚科等地、劃定國營區數處、先行開採、就最近兩年來的統計、每年約產二萬兩、</p>
<p>湖南省內多山金鑛、範圍甚大、在部省合作開辦下、每年至少有一萬二千兩的產量、</p>
<p>靑海省境內、在源縣永安城轉風窰及樂都縣石坡莊一帶、已勘定國營鑛區多處、進行採探工作、又在共和縣的下口。化隆縣的化隆科沿溝·民和縣的硤門等處、也勘定了國營區、着手試探、最近已有成功的希望、該區內的金量、每年的爲一萬兩、</p>
<p>廣西省境內、以上林縣爲最著、每年產金量約在三萬兩以上、廣東省內的金鑛、大都貧瘠、每年產金不過在二千兩左右、</p>
<p>此外如貴州省境內、金鑛尙未有詳細的調查、但江口縣梵凈山和下江縣的金鑛、也已在採掘、產兩數百兩、雲南省內、在怒江·金沙江·瀾滄江各岸、有相當豐富的鑛床、每年該省約產二千兩、甘肅省境內、重要者在祁連山北麓、這里每年金的產量頗微、湖北的鄖縣、陝西安康縣、河南的淅川縣、柳州溝及荊紫關等的漢冰、丹江流域、也有沙金鑛、土法開採、每年產量有二千餘兩、還有新疆省內的金鑛、產量無確實報吿、但每年至少要在二萬二千兩以上、</p>

<p>此外民營的、　有執照　由經濟部核准設定鑛權的、在二十七年政府頒給五十六張新的採金准許狀、另外還有許多沒有請領准許的團體和個人的採金組織共計二十七年註冊的採金共採出十五萬英兩的金、截至二十八年三月底止、業經核准、領有執照的民營金鑛、計廣東省十八區、廣西省六區、西康省一區、雲南省二區、江西省二區、四川省五十六區、湖南省十七區、總共一百零二區、內中有六十區是二十六年底以前所核准設權者、所以綜合最近十數個月以來、民營的設權、金鑛增加率爲百分之一百四十　、又據二十七年七月到二十八年五月這時期中的統計、中·中·交·中農·四銀行從各處採金者購進有十四萬三千英兩的純金、這批金如以每一英兩合二百元計算、其價値總計要有二千八百六十萬元、這一個數目、如果再加上被私人購進或收藏的四萬英兩至五寓英兩的數目。那末、總產量當在十九萬英兩左右、比了以前每年平均出產十三萬英兩要强、由此二點、我們也可以看出採金事業在中國，是向前進展了、如果能澈底的去探勘、以及能全部用機器開採、那末、採金事業在中國、前途更是無限了、</p>

<p>今日一五五一革命紀念節、</p>
<p>上海特別市黨部發出吿民衆書略稱、「五五」是本黨總理孫先生就任非常大總統的紀念日、據我們看米、這個「雙五節」是和「雙十節」有着同樣重大意義的、因爲那時的北洋軍關種種毀法的行爲、種種壓迫人民的行爲、種種勾結帝國主義者的行爲、以及陳炯明等的叛變、阻撓國民革命鬧得天昏地黑、國將小國了、總理看了這種情形、怎麼不痛心、乃本着他的大無長精神、成立革命政府、就任非常大總統、負起革命的重担、不妥協、不畏難、與四面八方的惡勢力奮鬥、卒能成就革命的偉火事業、所以假使沒有民國十年的「雙五節」、怕早把辛亥的「雙十節」毀棄了、然而現在　情形、比民國十年更可怕了、我們在這個時候紀念「雙五卽」、便應該效法總理創造「墜五節」的奮鬥精神、堅信總理的三民主義—救國主義、不屈服、不怕死、在睿智英明的蔣總裁的領導之下、堅定抗戰必勝建國必成的信念、再接再厲、加緊工作、这纔是三民主義的忠實信徒、看吧、日本的經濟已在崩潰了、日本的政治、已在動搖了、日本的軍隊、行將消滅了、這次串演的傀儡戲、便是沒落時的廻光返照、只要我們四萬萬五千萬人的正氣和熱血團結一致、築成鋼一般的戰綫、拚命進攻、光明就在我們的眼前、</p>

<p>本埠金融市塲、自日前外匯暗市變動之後、無意識者　機搗亂、人心益爲惶惑、昨日適逢週六、市塲中忽又謠傳有限制提存之說、一時各大銀行錢莊門首、紛紛發生擠提舉動、幸而各銀錢號應付得宜、未生事故、昨據某金融當局談、最近上海金融巾塲、雖極紊亂、要皆投機者故意擾亂所致、至限制提存、在理論上固屬可能、實際上決不致實現、其理　有三、（一）去年與今年情形不同、依一般情形　、愈形限制提存則提存者愈多、其結果反易造成恐慌、（二）各銀行錢莊在去年六月中、因事出突元、確感非常聚張、今年因業有準備、足資應付、無需限制、（三）外滙黑價、現正尋求其自然水凖、尙未臻絕對穩定時期、此時限制提仔、決無良好效果、要之、市塲緊張任何人旣知爲投機勢力所致而遏止投機、端在各個明瞭本身地位、共同防禦、依通貨與物價原理、通貨集中在余融機關手中、得　正當運用、則投機資金、即可减少、反之　通貨自金融機關提出、則籌碼需要旣多、流通速率、亦隨之增加、物資之供求、自難調和、等於自殺行爲、一部份市民僅知投機者之搗亂、不知制裁投機者、正在具本身之努力、</p>
<p>平準委會　委員表示</p>
<p>外匯平準基金委員英人斯登氏、於最近由香港來滬、據渠稱、在最近若干時來、該會並未放出英鎊、藉以維持黑匯之價値，因邇來中國對外貿易出超頗鉅、而華僑　匯款返國、雖在中國陰歷新年已過、而仍殷繁猶昔、在三月份間、計匯歸中國者、達三千五百萬元美金云、又據斯登氏稱、上海工業化、近漸有復興之象、而自去年歐戰起後、出口事業、尤有篷勃氣象、此在去年之滬海關報吿中、可以見及之、今年春季、上海之國際貿易、較之一九三九年同期間、計增進有百分之八十八·八、而在今夏間、則棉織品及其他工業製成品、尤尙有重要之增加、故滬上市面、大有好轉之可能、</p>
<p>打擊日偽　套取外滙</p>
<p>又關於最近本市黑匯市塲波動問題、據接近財政當局之權威力面、發表意見云、此次黑匯雖吿猛縮、但中央銀行之法定外匯、仍維持一先令二便士半之原價、此次日僞方面、又在本埠黑市塲從事鉅額套匯、當局為謀打擊此項陰謀、乃酌予限制供給、蓋此項經濟策略、足以使日僞方面、在淪陷區內所搜括或攫取之鉅額法幣、削减其套滙所得、在經濟原則上、中國政府原可絕對停止供給上海黑匯之支出、其所以苦心維持者、原為顧全英美等第三國之貿易權益耳、</p>
<p>苦心顧全　英美貿易</p>
<p>如果中國政府、完全停化供給上海黑匯、對於抗戰時期內財政基礎、常益形鞏固、而有利於戰時金融　共故第一因不正當外匯之停止支出、在華方可减少資金流出、在日方則無從將其所搜攫之法幣、獲得外匯、第二、阻止不必要的外貨進口、使土貨出口增加、國家財政收支、不但可以平衡、抑且吸收外來外匯、但現因顧全第三國之對華貿易起見、故僅限制供給、而將飄匯縮低而已，</p>
<p>財政機構　愈形健全</p>
<p>故此次黑匯猛縮、確可打擊日僞之套匯、並非平準基金用　、更非法幣貶值、蓋平準基金、非但並不用罄、且已決定增加、法幣之準備金、亦極充足、而今後更因外匯流出减少、國際貿易輸出增加、而使法幣基礎益形穩固、此乃具有經濟常識者一致公認、是故今後華方財政機構、愈見健全、國家資金、愈得充實、對於抗建大業、實有利無弊、</p>
<p>租界佈告　措置適當</p>
<p>至於本埠物價高漲、乃爲一般投機者、擅自高抬物價所致、絕非法幣貶値、此等投機之徒、顯在利用目前租界情形特殊、政府鞭長莫及、唯利是圖、喪心病狂、實爲國家之　、目前黑匯雖縮、但無論其爲外貨國貨、均無立即抬高市價之理由、此種利潤、亦屬非法所得、兩租界之立即緊急佈吿、取締非法漲價、措置甚爲適當、</p>

<h3 id="c88">糧食　洋米大做皮球生意　—一日之間上落至三四元之鉅— <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>昨日米市變化多端、起伏不定、早承上日餘勢、人心堅昂、竟成不動則已、一動喊聲若狂、霎那間交易既旺、各貨行情即猛飛二元有奇、尤以小絞最活、竟打破今庚紅盤時、開出五十元、其後聞金價穿出七千元大關、激得一般浮囤散戶更覺興奮、掀風作浪、不論貨之優劣、祇恐不得着手、一味拉進、施其操縱之故技、造成曩所未有之塔尖、若一號西貢開五十四元、小絞五十二元、較之前午收盤價又提三四元之巨、所幸自後市盤旋、無復繼起、且以金價回落、人心頗挫、而獲利者又紛紛回出、高價難持、步步向下、一號西貢落至五十二元半、小絞四十九元半、直至收市未能再起、結果比之隔昨收盤價見增元半、而與前朝高峯相較、祇好半元光景、全市一緊一疲、先後起伏、竟達三元、可見邇米米市之變化劇烈、査此次漲風、僅區區數朝、猝升十元、其一漲之威尤甚於屠割、</p>
<p>國米常斯洋米暴風烈雨之際、自亦並駕齊驅、惟以不受滙水影響、其勢遂不若洋米之甚、僅屬相互牽引、同被帶高而已、傳聞塲外暗盤、厚薄粳一等去路雖頗栗落、而售價祇有元餘上落、無錫特別淸粳五十一二元、粉粳五十元、常崑粳五十一元、次至宿熱者四十八九元、靑泗特薄稻五十一元左右、大市五十元、四十九元、南港早晚稻高目四十九元、次至四十七八元云云、糯米價盤雖廉、無如去路微細、終不若他貨之緊、致價不易猛提、僅增半元、開溧陽金壇特元四十四元半、四十四元、大市四十二一二元、常丹貨高自四十二三元、次至潮軟者仍祇四十元出零、昨日到貨聞由內河小輪及虹口區轉出者、的有粳糯一千七八百包、</p>
<p>洋米在投機在熱中、市面已失常態、實銷寥寥無幾、市塲中完全爲皮球生意、一聞金滙繼縮莫不爭先買進、設有金跌之訊、則又羣相競脫、早市承前日漲風、買氣極旺、一號陳西買竟有五十四元之價成交、小絞至五十二元、其他各米一致上抬、比之前晚收市價又漲二尤左右、若以前日上午收價則有三四元之差、然聞滙水回長之說、市價即在競相求脫下回小一二元矣、午後略振、結果與前日收價無大出入、惟回籠五月上二號西貢、早市開價大至六十一元、比前晚漲元半、旋以浮戶獲利斬多下、逐喚逐低、下午最低小至五十八元七角、收市稍振、價五十九元一角、仍比前晚小落四五角、進出兩旺、期貨的六七百噸、現米近萬包、仍以浮戶爲主、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、廠盤續加二角、改爲十四元現鈔、因金市再騰、米價步漲、各廠成本須在十五元以上、對於本街批價、尙屬維持性質、回籠貨老車牌被囤戶關住、須售十四元四五角、但未有相當成交、內地粉近以本街樂取、漲風更熾、如雙獅牌竟達十四元三角、山鹿牌十四二角半、成交的有四五千包、悉由本街辦去、本街向廠零批者約計七千包、</p>
<h3 id="c90">油市　油豆實銷仍乏 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>油市情勢、仍不脫環境牽制、致人心仍然濤躍、市塲中交易異常熱鬧、但實銷祇占四分之一、上漲步伐尙狹隘、結果豆油少有軒輊、惟花生油稍緊一二元、今日生油六百五十聽運香港、</p>
<p>黃豆昨日續升四五角、惟其脚地不固、似週一外來風浪不大、人心勢必動搖、恐大局難以支持矣、今有黃豆一千六百三十包運香港、</p>
<h3 id="c91">糖市　糖價漲風仍熾 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯續緊、公會劃盤、再度上展、現貨二四粗白外棧三月十八到貨七十六元、四月二十八日到貨七十六元半、又升三元許、太古車白B嘜爲八十六元、升一二元、H車赤六十一元半至六十三元、升三元、國糖果鄉赤五十八元、又升五元、海南赤五十五元至五十六元、猛升十餘元、刁靑四六十五元、未有成交、</p>

<p>紗市依然紊亂不堪、一般投機者利用外滙、時伸時縮之機會、仍屬傾向拖進、但一味上騰、實銷大滯、所以二十支雙馬大衆目標將其作工具、漲力殊强、因此二十支同類之棉紗價格、要　雙馬低廉一百二十元至二百元之間、可想消費者之乏力也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日午後、美匯改縮、人氣熱烈、叫喊紊亂如蔴、形勢時弛時緊、二十支雙馬現貨一跳百元、爲一千七百六十元、五月份期貨價爲一千八百元、做到一千八百十五元、旋以美匯開出、而後轉穩、人氣忽鬆懈、現貨跌至一千七百〇八元、收盤回上十元外、査半日間成交統計一千五百二十包、今日有紗二百〇五件運杳港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易異常淸澹、但氣勢尙堅挺、至於廠方絕少生氣、一包不辦、同行互相賣買亦不及昔日之熱鬧、實則銀根緊迫之故也、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、市况頗爲靜寂、後父因南方之套賣、及海外商之賣出、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落五六磅音、印度棉市、因上海匯兌暴縮之影響、各方俱抱觀望、昨日連同預測漲一羅比、埃及漲八九磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來較爲靜寂、但各方繼續棉價看高、然銀根奇緊、故交易稀淡、然據可靠消息、日方存棉不多、將於日內採辦現貨云、</p>

<p>布價續見昂騰、因業內外囤戶購胃仍濃、廠盤已扳高、故搜羅手貨、頗爲殷切、惟實銷背道而馳、益形减色、市盤紊亂不堪、同樣品質之布、以牌子生熟關係、價格相差每疋須達五六元之多、乃緣熟牌子符合投機者之需要、尤有甚者、東貨龍頭細布廠棧單貨須較現貨昂每疋四五元、誠怪現象也、全日成交本街同業賣買八百餘件、售盤白貨漲二角五分至一元、色布漲一元至二元、漂布等淺色貨寥寥、今有疋頭一百三十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布晨漲午跌、細布回落每疋八九角、蓋在晨開之際、市氣殊堅、龍頭現　單最高價曾到四十六元左右、未幾即降至午收盤四十四元五角、後市因謠言孔多、金融界有限制提存等消息、人心恐惶、銀根吿緊、市塲交易轉淸、細布一度到四十三元五角、迨至收盤復昂、龍頭細布爲四十四元、本月份四十六元半、四君子嗶嘰現盤每碼二元五角六分、</p>

<p>— 松</p>
<p>已失去主動的地位　進攻力量愈久愈衰</p>
<p>中國消耗戰的成功</p>
<p>一年兩年；整個三年在望的日本對華戰爭，依然處處膠着於中國泥土的無法解決。這是出乎中國人意料之內，而出乎日本人意料之外的。終於由於事實的昭示，日本軍閥也明白這是一個長期戰爭了。前首相阿部，在去年十一月二十五日的廣播演說中，公開承認，「中國事件的完成及其後果的斛除，至少須十年期間。」日本軍事政治領袖所抱的悲觀態度，在他方面，適足證明中國民衆所採用的消耗戰略，收了</p>
<p>中國消耗戰的成功</p>
<p>很大的效果，而使日方無法自拔。正如有人指出，中國已到了長期抗戰的第二期，在這階段中，日本的兵力將逐漸消耗，减弱，而失去其優勢。</p>
<p>在第一期作戰中，日本軍隊，以其優越的索質，精良的武器，曾幾度想殱滅中國軍隊的主力。但在中國民族解放戰爭的第一階段中，形勢與以往大不相同。日軍攻下了武漢，佔領發廣州後，日人早已宣稱，今後將是一個政治的進攻，然而這一目標，日本根本沒有達到。長期戰爭，依然進行着。隨着二期戰爭到來，日本在軍事已失去了她的主動的地位。中國能够順利進行她的消毀日本前綫作戰士兵的士氣及增高日本國內民衆厭戰情緒的目的。這本身說明中國長期抗戰的戰略是成功的。</p>
<p>日本攻勢衰退</p>
<p>從一九三九年的軍事行動來看，日本進攻的力量，遠不及　，這是日本攻勢的一趨衰竭的一個證明。一九三九年的日本軍事行動，沒有一次達到她頂定的消滅中國主力的目標。從另一方面講，這就是中國軍隊抵抗力量的增高的證明。去年日軍大規模的軍事行動，是進攻南昌，其目的是擴張勢力於漢口以南，而减少華軍對其運輸幹綫（長江水道）的威脅。日軍爲達到這種目的，於是向南昌岳州長沙一帶進展，如果這計劃成功，這一帶就可成爲日軍的根據地，南沿粵漢　進展，興粵中的日軍會師，切斷中國沿海各省如福建廣東浙江與內地的聯絡。不過日軍的企圖，化了九牛二虎的氣力，只實現了一個目標，那就是南昌的佔領。日軍的向長沙進展，爲華軍所阻。到了四月，日軍又改易了她的進展的目標，想使漢口而向西北進展，以信陽南陽爲目標。同時開封的日軍，也南下以爲呼應。日軍這决進攻，出乎意料之外，遭到台兒莊以來的空前大敗。一退就是兩百公里，並且死傷人數有好幾萬，鄂北的大進攻，就此吿一段落。</p>
<p>到了去年九月，日軍又圖進犯湘北，完成她一月中進佔岳州長沙的計劃。結果在長沙郊外大敗，日本士兵死傷達三萬之衆。從去年日本軍事行動看米，至少給人幽個印象，一個是手忙脚亂，沒有一定的目標，一個是人規模的軍事行動，都遭到了華軍的重創，而無法進展。</p>
<p>日本目標已亂</p>
<p>日軍去年最大的成就，自爲欽防偷襲，與南寗佔領的成功。日軍旣不能在腹地擊潰華軍中力，於是想切斷中國國際通道，用『經濟的絞斃』來完成她的侵略的目的，但欽防的登陸及南寗的佔領，並沒有達到她預冀的目的，在日軍佔領南寗後，就陷於中國軍隊半圓形的包圍中，幾進幾出，始終沒有能北趨柳州，西下龍州，而切斷龍州通越南的國際交通綫。</p>
<p>一九四〇年開始，日本想從粵漢峪南犯，以爲桂南日軍的呼應，但大舉進犯的結果，粵北華軍發探了雄厚的力量，日本軍隊又被迫退至廣州近郊</p>
<p>發揮游擊戰的力量</p>
<p>總結起來，日軍一九三九年的軍事行動，沒有一件可說是達到她的預冀　目的。中國今後不但要用正規軍來防制日軍的進展，並且以游擊軍來擾亂日軍的後方。這一戰術，在華北尤發揮極大的力量，游擊戰在山西的活動，使日本在華北的軍事一無進展，日軍早已喊出了肅淸游擊隊的口號，但去年日軍在晋省的八次總攻，都吿失敗，證明游擊隊的力量是不可侮的。最近綏西的大勝，也是流動戰成功的另一證明。</p>
<p>政治攻勢必歸失敗</p>
<p>所以從日本侵華的形勢上來講，由於中國長期抗戰的收效，由於日軍的點綫太長，防守爲　，由於日本軍氣的衰落及國內厭戰情緒的高漲，日本在戰爭上已沒有擊潰中國主力的可能。而只有相反地力量愈久愈衰落下去。這結果使日軍閥焦灼，而急謀『中日事件』的早日解決，目前由軍事的攻勢，轉變而爲政治的攻勢，成立僞組織，就是想以華制華，達到她不戰而勝的目的。日本的企圖，顯然必吿失敗，中國求自由獨立的決心，將因最近軍事上的日趨優勢而愈堅定，決不會因日本使弄手法而就被其欺騙，對於抗戰到底的基本政策有所更張的。</p>
<h3 id="c107">汪日密約的主謀　阿部特使的隨員　影佐與犬養 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 韋</p>
<p>這次南京汪政權以後，日本政府便任命阿部信行爲特派大使，預備進行和平談判，調整中日關係，建設所謂「東亞新秩序」，以實現她滅亡中國的迷夢。阿部現已來華，手下隨員衆多，能手不少，其中有兩個人，一個是軍人派影佐禎昭，一個是議會派犬養健，都很熟悉中國情形，也就是汪日密的的主動者，却是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>影佐，廣島縣人，士官學校二十六屆畢業生，曾在南京上海各地供職，七七事變以前，他任日本參謀本部的「支那班長」，及戰事發展，職位亦隨之上昇，他不單指導戰事，目對於內政，外交，經濟任何方面，部有密切的交涉。第二年六月，他昇任爲日本陸軍省的軍務課長。</p>
<p>日本勞師動衆，滿想一口氣以武力征服中國，那知遭遇中國堅强抗戰，陷入泥淖，難以自拔，於是另出奇兵，想從政治方面圖謀救濟，所以前年十一月，有近衛聲明的出現，，到今日更有南京政權的成立，這個政治的與軍事的雙管齊下政策，你道是誰在幕後主動，却就是影佐的得意之作。所以他這一次隨阿部而來，必然的還有許多詭計，扮演出來。</p>
<p>犬養健是東京大學文科學生，父親犬養木堂，繼田中之後，爲政友會總裁。及濱口內閣時代舉行總選舉，犬養以文人而在東京二區當選爲議員，這是由於文壇的擁護，和其家族的淵源才當選的。</p>
<p>犬養自去年夏季以來即在中國活動。本屆議會中討論在政權事，犬養曾對閣員及貴衆兩院議員，作有力的說明。獲得異常的成功，正因爲他並非軍人，才格外得到議會的信任，所以他的演說完畢，就有好幾名議員趨前握手，表示欽佩之意。</p>
<p>犬養和中國的機緣也是由於犬養木堂而發生，木堂是孫總理的老友，在總理逝世時他也曾參加祭典，那時犬養健也一同隨行。凡國民黨領袖他都曾有一面之緣。</p>
<p>他在學生時代，文藝上已有許多作品，如「家鴨的出世」，「一個時代」，「南京的一夜」等，都受人愛讀，尤其是「女優」一篇小說根使讀者留得深刻印象。</p>
<p>影佐和犬養，自認爲對中國有進步的認識。影佐批評國內政治家，對於中國的認識，不免有不統一和混亂的缺點，他說看中國是一個特殊的國家，出乎世界史的政治法則之外，是不對的。把中國看得還是中日戰爭時代一樣，更是不對。中日事變的發生，即由於日本對中國認識的錯誤。現在如果要斛救事變的困難，必需經過久長的時日，雙方互相反省，而改變舊的覜念，才有希望</p>

<p>— 周　摘譯Oarl　Craw原著</p>
<p>麻醉劑—鴉片，嗎啡，及海洛英—是日本對中國的軍事侵略的刺刀頭。</p>
<p>麻醉劑販子爲先衛</p>
<p>以麻醉劑販子爲前衛使人民墮落，　別是戰鬥年齡的壯丁，他們爲軍事勝利鋪平了一條路。特務機關的陰謀，使中國人沉湎其中，這些中國人或許會成對征服者發生危險的領袖。一隊　隊與軍隊同來的麻醉劑小販，保持人民使為奴隸，同時父得從中得利。毒藥交易帮助日本軍隊的財政。</p>
<p>日本是明知故犯。對於日人嗜毒，日本法律處罰，在世界上爲最嚴厲，並切實奉行。舉一個例，僅僅有一枝烟槍，就得罰七年苦工。小冊子分發給兵士們，其中有一節說：「麻醉劑的享用，是不配爲日本人那樣優等種族的。僅是劣等民族，那是衰微的，如中國人歐洲人及東印度人沉湎於麻醉劑的享用中。這所以他們命中汪定爲我們的奴隸，結局則消　」。</p>
<p>當他們取得滿洲，日本人第一次把握着麻醉劑的潛力，作征服的媒介。吃鴉片的滿洲軍隊沒有抵抗即遁逃或投降。於是日本軍隊從事使用麻醉劑，頂備征服華北的程序。軍隊　日本外交家爲送來的高麗販子舖平一條道路。在國內高麗人是沒有公民權利的；最底下的日本人能鞭撻高麗的貴族而不受罰。但當漢城的下賤者來到中國，開始販賣麻醉劑，他們就成了皇家的重要代表了。假如被中國驚察拘獲，日本驚察强迫釋放了。</p>
<p>這樣在日本人控制的中國各地佈滿着麻醉劑—如肥皂或火油似地公開發售。每個上海，廣東，北平，蘇州，南京，漢口的美國僑民見了這些災禍，都不勝恐懼。毒物政策在南京最成功，三年前，南京與任何美國城市一樣，沒有麻醉劑。在中國人統治時不經醫生證明購麻醉劑是不可能的。即在姦淫搶掠未止以前，日本人已開始公賣鴉片嗎啡及海洛英了。</p>

<p>正如美國海軍少校佛萊切所說「惡疫與戰爭一向在一起的，但這却剩給日本人去覓得從惡疫中償付戰爭的一條路」</p>
<p>最近毒物運銷情形</p>
<p>據英美居民的調查，在一九三九年初，南京有五萬人—全人口的八分之一—吸食毒品。據最近報告的估計則占全人口四分之一至三分之一。南京的鴉片公賣處，自稱爲禁烟局，每月的交易有五百萬元，這些總數可作二十萬人衣食住之用。</p>
<p>在北平有五百家售麻醉劑的店，較其他各業爲多。三年前在上海我住過的一條靜靜的小街，現在已滿佈着燕子窩及毒物店了。</p>
<p>一九三九年「滿洲國」的預算，鴉片稅爲七千一百萬日元，較一九三八年增加二千四百萬日元。過了幾月，官塲稱述，稅款可超過九千萬日元。在某一時期，鴉片稅居稅收中第二位，如以目下增加的速力繼續不止，或許可到第一位。「滿洲國」可很適當地用罌粟花裝設牠的紙幣了。</p>
<p>高麗每年平均鴉片出產，通常的一噸。在一九三一年增至五噸，一九三二年七噸，一九三三年十四噸。在一九三七年，爲中國事件，鴉片的應用，有新的需要，幾乎到了三十噸。</p>
<p>從一九二八年至一九三四年；每年波斯鴉片的輸出，速這二年包括在內的平均數，約五白噸。在一九三五年，日本軍隊是主要的顧主，波斯鴉片的輸出跳到一個新的高度，爲八百三十三噸，一九三六年父增加至一千三百四十六噸的可驚總數。有些鴉片是裝在掛有日本軍隊運輸旗的船上，直接運到軍隊裏。可見麻醉劑的戰爭劉於軍隊現在的勝利，及以後保持墮落的民族對征服者的奴性，是太有利太重要了。</p>

<p>土人心理亦應注意</p>
<p>我國國貨除了行銷國內各地外，南洋也是國貨最大的尾閭，戰前，國貨之運銷南洋者已很多，自戰軍發生，內地交通不便，而海外僑胞又受了戰事的刺激，更加重了他們愛用國貨的熱忱，因此幾年來上海國貨工廠製造的貨物，除了一部份運銷內地外，大部份都往南洋運銷。加以最近法幣與南洋貨幣及港幣的匯率，相差過鉅，正是國貨行銷南洋的一個良機，所以辦理國貨出口事業者，莫不注意南洋，而南洋僑商之回國調查及採辦國貨者，父絡繹於途。記者爲明瞭南洋僑商對於國貨的意見以及國貨行銷南洋之品質種類起見，特走訪新自南洋來滬採辦之某君，承見吿以下各點：</p>
<p>就目前情形而論，國貨之在南洋銷路最大者，無過於布疋，日用品，食物，電器，調味品，玻璃器皿，搪瓷鋼精用具及綢緞等，戰前，因爲日貨在南洋大量傾銷，國貨在南洋則因種種關係，不能儘量的發展。自中日歐洲戰事相繼發生，一方面日貨的產量又日漸减少，歐洲貨物亦因戰事關係不能大量的運銷南洋，這正是國貨獨霸南洋極好的時機。不過國貨之運銷南洋，有幾點必須注意的，就是消費者並不完全是華僑，而有大部分的土人在內。因爲南洋的土人不事生產，他們日常所需用的消費品，都是仰賴別人而不能自己生產，貨品只要能迎合他們的心理，適合他們的需要，他們是不管那一國貨物的　因爲這樣，所以行銷南洋的貨物，一定要能迎合華僑及土人的心理與需要。其次貨物運銷南洋的包裝必須注意，因爲包裝不良而貨物發生破碎，使經售者受到很大的損大，以後即不願再行採購了。國貨在南洋，因有歐美貨與日貨與之競銷，若不隨時改進其品質式樣，實難永久立足。至於廣吿亦應注意，國貨能在南洋各地多做廣吿，則其印象深入人心，引起該地人民的信仰，前途的發展當無限量。目前國貨之推銷有一極大的危機而亟須設法解決者，即現款與期貨問題。外國商人在南洋售出一批貨物，住往有九十天付款的辦法，國貨之在南洋交易，完全是貨款兩交，沒有定期付款辦法，</p>
<h3 id="c111">當前的敎訓 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 白羽</p>
<p>這一週來，因爲外匯發生了空前的變動，上海的各項物價，聯帶的起了漲風，一切生活必需品，莫不高漲二成至三成，於是有家庭負祖的薪給階級者與夫主持家政的主婦們，個僩苦悶徬徨，感覺到生活無法應付。就目前的情勢說，米貴煤貴，油鹽小菜，衣服鞋襪，房租交通，無一不貴，收入無法增加，而物價的上漲，却靡有止境，一個人的生活，已不容易應付，而負有家庭負担的薪給階級者與家庭主婦們，鑒於目前各物高漲嚴重的情勢，徬徨苦悶，勢所必然。生活之困難苦悶爲當前一嚴重問題徬徨非解決問題之方，外匯如此之緊縮物價如此之高漲自有其發生之因，戰時外匯投機者之推波助瀾，囤積者之居奇操縱，固然是原因之一，而外貨大量進口，入超增多，資金外流，亦未始非重要原因之一。據海關總稅務司發表今年三月份我國對外貿易，洋貨進口總値國幣一萬五千四百十九萬三千六百九十五元，土貨出口凈値國幣一萬二千六百二十七萬三千二百四十四元，入超二千七百九十二萬零四百五十一元。雖然上海的進出口比較出超二百三十八萬七千八百四十九元（出口爲七六，六四六，八〇四元，進口爲六四，二五八，九五五元），但拿全國整個的對外貿易說，二千七百餘萬的入超，却未始非戰時經濟的一大漏巵。我們固然不能說戰時就要絕對的不用外貨，但國家旣在戰時，國民理應含辛茹苦的生活以保存一些國家的經濟實力，我們非有十二分的必要，不能再事購買外貨。而就海關總稅務司的報吿，三月份單果品子仁菜蔬的進口總値，即値二百二十五萬二千三百三九海關金單位，若合以法幣即値六百餘萬元，菸草進口，亦達一百九十餘萬金，合之法幣亦値五百餘萬元。其他非必要的奢侈品化裝品尙未計算，單果品子仁菜蔬菸草的進口已達一千一百餘萬元了。無怪南洋華僑桂君此次來滬，鑒於滬人的窮奢極慾認爲是非有人心者所應爾了。目前外匯發生劇變，物價趨於高漲，每一個感覺生活困難的人，不要徬徨苦悶，更不要怨天尤人，每個人自己先要反省一下，造成這樣現象的，不是一人的責任，每一個購買外貨的人，都應負一部分的責任。外匯緊縮，外貨暴騰，山於客觀情勢的逼迫，我們之對於國貨，已由「自動的」購用而成爲「被動的」購用了，非有十二分的必要不購買外貨，這是戰時國民生活最低限度的準則，如果這一點再做不到，則目前生活的困難，猶是初步，來日的困難，將十百倍於今日。試思國家尙在戰時，政府對於外匯的維持，煞費苦心，而國民對於日常消費品雖至菓品之微，猶以美國橘子金山蘋菓是尙，政府雖有大力，平準基金縱然雄厚，又安能維持外匯法定之價格？這次外匯劇變的原因很複雜，影響當然也很重大，而最感苦痛者却無過於一般薪給階級與家庭主婦力我們除了節衣縮食以求渡此難關外，此外尙有特須注意者，我們旣然受了外匯緊縮的苦痛，則此後任何人不能輕易的消耗一分外匯，換言之，我們不能再輕易的購買一分外國貨，爲了民族爲了國家乃至於爲了個人，這是當前的敎訓所給予我們的一個反省。</p>

<p>— 競存</p>
<p>本月二日外匯黑市突然發生變動，市塲上即刻發生了反應。大家都知道外匯緊縮，物價將要上漲，於是有錢者紛紛購買大量貨物，據說這一天南京路中國國貨公司的營業達六萬餘元，顧客購貨形同搶奪，而這些到公司中去購買貨物者，完全是爲了物價高漲而不得不多購一些以免受漲價的損失，這一班人當然不能算是囤戶，實為了顧全本身利益不得不如此者。看了這種情形使我聯想到過去物價的高漲，由於外匯緊縮的原因固然是有，而由於投機者的囤積居奇，却也是一個重要的原因，外匯緊縮，外貨的價格一定高漲，國貨的消費額一定增多，雖然國貨的原料，有一部份不得不用外匯去購買，但國貨的漲價，不會如外貨的漲得利害，這是可以斷言的。此次外匯發生變動，國貨的消費額增多，投機者之轉移目光於國貨，未始不可能。我們爲了顧全大衆的生活，爲了防止投機者的牟利，不得不高喊一句口號：「謹防囤積國貨。」</p>
<p>從事貨物囤積的投機者，決不是　些零星購買者，而是大批躉購者，過去煤號棧單就是一例，在此外匯空前緊縮的時候，國貨工廠對於承接定貨簽發定單應該十分的審愼，因爲定單一入了投機者之手，馬上即成了投機者的籌碼而輾轉交易，貨物無法行銷市面，而貨價亦因之高漲，生產者與消費者失却聯繫，而轉爲投機者所操縱所播弄，這是對於生產者與消費者都有不利的行爲，希望國貨工廠密切的注意。</p>

<p>我當時聽了，覺得十分駭怕，後來我的知識進步，緩明白這種懼怕，是無根據的，因爲這個太陽，還不知可以燃燒幾千萬年。但是有一種懼怕，並非無根據，就是科學進步這麽快，這個世界，恐怕因為人類奢慾的爆發而變得不適于安居。爲了這個原故，如今的人，有一種迫切要求，是以前歷史不曾見過的。耶穌紀元後，約四千五百年的時候，亞洲有一種蠻族，侵入到羅馬，要羅馬納　。這種蠻民，那時的人給他起名叫做匈。匈是什麽？他不是野獸，也不是魔鬼，乃是一種矮小的人。他如別人一般，有一顆心，但是一顆小的心，他有同情心，但是有階級性的同悄心，他有理想，但是自私的理想，他有本分的意識，但是狹窄的，有界限的意識。前次歐戰時候，協約國常駡德人為匈。但是廣義的說呢，　種人不但德國有，在勞工階級，頑固的雇主，結黨的政客，和固執的牧師中間都有。質而言之，凡思想狹窄，同情心有階級性，服務有界限的人，都是這種人。在科學時代，這種人不論平時戰時都爲世界的威脅。科學和匈，這兩種東西，使世界變得可怕。沒有科學，匈只是地方的一種威脅，有了科學，他就變成世界的威脅了。這兩種東西，一日不斷絕關係，世界便一日不免戰爭。有些人是這際安慰自己，說是前次世界大戰，是末了一次的大戰，可是我呢，却認為是世界許多次大戰的開始，而且將來的戰爭，必一次厲害一次。所以，科學和匈這兩者中問的連擊，必須打破，或將科學剷除，或將匈消滅，二者必去其一而後可。　（待續）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>— 何逸厂</p>
<p>日前本刋曾載着一篇「應廢除幾個不良的習慣」的文字：小朋友們，諒早已見釗了。但依我看來，除了「吃閒食，看速環圖畫，亂塗紙張，」的三種不良習慣之外，還有一種易染的惡習，也應該趕緊革除。這惡習就是「賭博」，比較起來，尤為重要。現在馬路上一般做小生意的糖果擔上，往往都含着賭博性質。他們用糖果玩具等，來引誘兒童，騙取兒童的金錢。他們帶着種種賭具，施出種種方法，如「轉糖擔，擲骰子，抽牌九，抽紙牌，」之類。尤其是，抽紙牌，來得最普遍。用幾張紙牌，上面寫着幾個字，如「航空救國」，「狸貓換太子，」等，打在什麽一個字上，抽出來相同，便可得彩。有一次，我親見一個十幾歲的小學生，提了書包，就在糖果擔邊玩這種賭。起初不渦幾分的下注，後來輸了，再接再厲。不到幾分鐘，竟輸去法幣八角。道種賭博，在小學校的門前，在散學的時候最多。喊着「打打看，來來看」。小朋友們，為僥倖心所驅使，又看着覺得很好玩，往往會不知不覺的加入。要知此種惡習，一則浪費金錢，二則妨害學業的進步，三則從小養成賭博嗜好，將來更要不堪設想。而且所贏到的，不過是些糖果等物。多吃了，也要壞身體。還有一種馬路旁的「賭博攤，」擺着各式要貨玩具，暗裏設有機關。同黨有六七人之多，他門都是些流氓白相人，更是騙人金錢。小朋友們更應遠而避之，萬萬不可上當。總之這種誘人賭博的小本營生，一方面，固然要希望警務當局，加以嚴厲取締。而另一方面，要由家長們隨時訓戒，使小朋友們明白此中害處，在下課時間，另我適當而有益的消遣才是！</p>

<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>明天，五月六日，又是立夏的季節，俗有「秤人」之舉，兒童時代，對於「立夏秤人」是感覺到非常有興趣的。</p>
<p>「秤人」的原意，是衡量一個人的體重，以為健康與否的指示，可是也有身體肥碩，而常常患病的，也有身體瘦削，而精神充足的，這大概由於營養食物的調攝不同，而異其現狀，傷飢，食飽的，肥碩何益？三餐均勻的，雖瘦何害？</p>
<p>我的在校的三個孩子，外貌似乎弱不禁風，而且瘦骨支離，（因為筆者家非素封，憑勞心，勞力換下來的酬報，給養他們，不過是粗肴，淡飯，並沒有像富裕人家的朝有牛奶，夜有參的將補孩子，）事實上，他們跳跳跑跑，終年不會生病的，也因我嚴厲限制孩子們，一日三餐，吃得調勻，並且絕對禁止吃零食的惡習慣。所以體重方面，雖和富戶的孩子，差得很遠？而精神方面，却始終是康健活潑。我的大孩子希聖，年十四歲，身長是五二吋，體重是五三磅，體育的成績，是七十分。我的次兒希賢，年十一歲，身長是四七吋二，體重是四五磅，體育的成績，是七十六分。我的三兒希曾年九歲。身長是四一吋，體重是四〇磅，體育的成績，是七十分。三個孩子的各個體重，那裏及得上健康的水準？（富家的嬰孩，生下來就有十磅重或十五磅重呢。）</p>
<p>小朋友們，注意自己的體重，固然不可忽視，而注意一日三餐的調節，（均勻）和戒絕零食，我認為更加重要，希望小朋友們，體騐而力行之。</p>

<p>— 惠生</p>
<p>星期日那天，風和日麗，春光明媚，上午我從學校裏上完了德育課回到家裏，父親說：「今天的天氣太好了，飯後我們到兆豐花園去遊玩。」我聽了非常高興。吃過午飯，父親使同我和妹妹一同出發。</p>
<p>我們從辣斐德路薩坡賽路口先乘二十四路無軌電車到靜安寺路口下車，再換乘一路的雙層公共汽車，直達兆豐花園，只見門口汽車塞土，人頭擠擠，售票門口，尺山人海，格外擁擠。爸爸費了九牛二虎之力，纔把門票買到。</p>
<p>進了園門，眼前呈現着一片碧綠的顏色。遊人如蟻，男女老幼，穿着五顏六色的春裝，和鮮艷的花草相映，格外顯得美麗。而日本男女小孩特別的多，這使我非常感觸！</p>
<p>我們走到池塘邊，四週圍着許多人，有幾個小朋友在池邊玩小帆船，漂泊池中，迎風疾駛，煞是好看。我們徘徊了　會，便向左面走去。走入一處高大的樹木叢裏，看見一對石像，拱立兩旁，穿過道對石人，發現一座古廟似的紅房子，有許多人在那裏休息。門前有一對石馬，我和妹妹爭着騎上去。再兜到廟後，登上一座土坵，上面新種着許多竹子，可惜還沒有長得茂盛。我在頂上向園中眺望，只見滿園都是遊人。</p>
<p>下了土山，從曲折的小徑走入了樹林深處，我們好像探險家似的去探尋動物園。彎彎曲曲，走了許多路，走過了英國兵房，纔發現了動物園。最先看見的是一羣高脚長嘴的鶴，我和妹妹都是初次看見眞的鶴，覺得非常有趣。走進一座小房子，裏面一邊是許多美麗的小鳥，吱吱喳喳地叫着；一邊是猢猻，有些人在和它們玩弄。走出房子，看見兩頭很大的黑熊。沿着半邊一帶的鐵橱欄裏，養着長尾的孔雀，鷹，雞，和各種不知名的羽毛鮮艷鳥類。另一面還有一對高大的鹿，都非常有趣。</p>
<p>我們離開了動物園，從別一條幽徑走入樹木花草叢裏，那里有小橋，有流水，有假山，四週樹木繁密，各種花草開着艷鮮的花朵，芬芳撲鼻，使人眞有說不出的愉快！有一位女子在寫生，描繪眼前萬紫千紅的花木，我們好像置身畫中，但又覺得畫中怎能描寫得盡！</p>
<p>走出了花叢，到了草坪的一角，有許多少女在玩排球。我們一直向東面走去，穿過了大草坪，到了東面一帶的小山上，那一帶小小的土山上面，種着茂盛的松柏花草等；山下是一條淸澈的小溪；像微着高山大川，另有一番趣味。</p>
<p>最後我們坐在樹薩下休息着，啖着甜美凉爽的紫雪糕，三小時的遊園，使我們的兩腿有些發酸。眼前成羣的遊人，不斷的熙來攘往，好像是鬧市的南京路上，上海的人口眞多啊！</p>

<p>媽媽和爸爸，我的兩個大哥哥傑克和生南，也都是這故事中的凳塲人物。此外要提起的，有五頭兎子，兩隻花背的鼇，鬈毛　狗羅台，意大利，法蘭西，倫敦，紐約，日本，檀香山各處送來的玩偶，什麽都有。關於人的方面，那麼有珍妮甘諾，溫斐爾希漢，我的敎師白克蘭小姐，傑密鄧恩，（如今我所最愛的就是他）加萊古柏，去年不幸慘死的那位威爾羅吉士先生，加傑克杜那許——總之，你只須豎起耳朶聽着好了。你祗是一頭小狗子，還不知什麽。我已六歲，却長大起來了。</p>
<p>這故事的開始，還在過去的一九二九年間，可甘，那是我出世的一年。媽媽和爸爸，爸爸銀行中的朋友們，（爸爸是綠杉磯一家銀行中的經理）往往喚我「倒運孩子」，原來這是全國商業衰落的一年。</p>
<p>我那時也不懂得什麽衰落不衰落，以為這是吉利的代名詞，至少是我們鄧波兒大吉大利的。去年電影藝術院的大宴會中，那位紅面孔而偉大的歐文高白先生，把一個小金像賞賜給我，一面說聖誕老公公把我降落到世界的烟囪中來，這就是各處千百萬人的幸運臨頭了。從這番話看來，可知這「倒運孩子」秀蘭是並不怎樣惡劣的。</p>
<p>可惜你沒有瞧見我們先前所住的屋子，它不像現在的住宅那麽大，只有五個小房間和一座園子罷了。我的林是安放在爸爸和媽媽的臥房中，和他們倆老是同在一起的。現在我却獨住一間房，這房中恰好安放我的許多玩偶。爸爸和媽媽也有他們自己的房；連兩個大孩子也共有一間房。（生南是在新墨西哥的陸軍學院中，所以實際上並不享到權利）樓下並且有一間房，我的秘書杜綠珊德勒就在那裏拆看影迷們寄給我的許多信，一面把我的照片分頭寄將出去。此外有一間很大的廚房，一間餐室，和一個美麗可愛的走廊。</p>

<p>第一次歐戰前，法國東部邊境住着一個哭笑無常的德國瘋子。他有一個怪癖，就是白天總是到荒山裏去捉蝴蝶。一到雨天，整日關在屋子裏埋頭畫着一張張不同樣的蝴蝶。他這樣獨自生活着也不跟人家胡鬧，所以人家也不去注意他。</p>
<p>大戰爆發後，德國參謀部突然多了個面目生疏少年英俊的軍官，研究着壁上一幅幅的軍事地圖，貢獻他新奇的戰略。小朋友，你道他是誰？就是那個畫蝴蝶的瘋子呀！</p>

<p>— 君美</p>
<p>去年陳雲裳女士膺聘來滬，攝製古裝片「木蘭從軍」的時候，筆者在本刋曾寫過一篇關於「木蘭從軍」的話，我希望陳女士有「光榮的員獻，來一掃妖氣，一新耳目」，希望攝製者「別太注重生意眼」而忽視了現寔」，木蘭從軍開映的結果雖並不如我所預期的「足以激勵民氣」，可是在此時此地的孤島上，當充滿了荒淫，神怪種種惡氣氛中，還是比較意識正確一點的。</p>
<p>爲了適應此時此地的特殊環境，攝製歷史劇古裝片來强調觀衆萎靡的意志，我們自然沒有話說，而且也祇有這樣做，製片商才能抓住了比較正確的路綫發展，這一個不得已的苦衷，我們對於劇作者，導演，以至於演員，是不忍加以開倒車的罪名的。</p>
<p>但一年來古裝片所給與我們的印象呢？</p>
<p>因爲古裝片取材相當地廣泛，在歷史與古裝的烟慕之下，古裝片便愈出愈離奇了，祇要有一個女主角，而故事相當熱鬧與習見熟聞的，自封神榜，三國志，西遊記，水滸，紅樓，西廂，以至於征東，征西，甚至於深印於低級社會頭腦裏的民間傳說，截取其一角，便有給攝製成片的可能，這其間雖然不乏意義比較深厚的，可是著意透露香艶，封建，頺喪，神秘底思想的，却也不在少數，這一個古裝片的發展，又豈是我們始料所及的呢！</p>
<p>魯迅先生以一代文豪，寫故事新編却並不能成爲數十百萬言的　洋巨著，這原因，魯迅先生當不是窘於材料至此，他小願粗製濫造來蒙蔽續者，欺騙讀者，這理由倒是簡單得很。因此，我們覺得在此時此地攝製古裝片，和魯迅先生的寫故事新編，寔在具有同一意義，撇開一切舊瓶新裝，新瓶舊裝等等理論不談，貽禍觀眾，却是無可諉罪的，對於古裝片的每况愈下，我們寔在不得不有此感想。</p>
<p>在原則上，我們依然不反對歷史古裝片，但我們希望攝製古裝片者勇於改過，「泥古不化」固然要不得，「惟利是圖」寔在也不足爲訓。而况祇是向古裝片的牛角尖裏鑽，鑽！鑽！鐵！終也有鑽到盡頭的一天？</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources here, a major battle for Xiangfan on the upper reaches of the Hanshui River is about to break out. It is reported that large numbers of Japanese troops are gathering in Xinyang and Zhongxiang, apparently preparing a two-pronged large-scale attack on Xiangfan. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th) From dawn one day in Nanyang, the Japanese troops massed in southern Henan began a multi-pronged fierce attack, attempting to advance westward and harass the eastern bank of the Han River. One route of the Japanese was severely hit by the Chinese forces near Minggang that day, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese immediately sent reinforcements from the Zhashan (northwest of Changtaiguan) area. The Chinese army, with its most mobile posture, inflicted serious blows on them section by section in the area between Pudian, Xingji, and Maoji (all west of Minggang). Another branch of the Japanese troops on this route secretly crossed the Ru River that afternoon, crossed Rendian (north of Minggang), and advanced to Zhugou (west of Queshan) that evening, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese forces. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese forces were greatly defeated, with bodies strewn all over the ground. As of last night, the Chinese forces had completed a large encirclement of the Japanese forces from the mountainous areas on both the north and south sides of the Qinyang-Queshan highway and the area east of Gaoyi (east of Qinyang), and were currently attacking on three sides. The Japanese troops who had advanced to the vicinity of Maoji were still hesitating in the mountains. The Chinese forces had cut off the Japanese rear according to the predetermined encirclement, and the Japanese were cut off from contact and would soon be wiped out. Another route of the Japanese Eastern Branch harassed Xiaolindian from Youhe (northwest of Xinyang) and along the Tongbai-Xinyang highway. The Chinese forces, relying on the superior terrain and strong fortifications near Xiaolindian, waited for the Japanese to approach and launched a fierce crossfire. In the fierce battle until the night of the 2nd, the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties, with more than half of their forces lost. After dawn on the 3rd, the Chinese army launched a fierce outflanking maneuver on the outer flanks of the two wings of the Japanese army with elite troops. At the same time, the Chinese front also launched a mobile counterattack. At this moment, they are actively moving towards their predetermined positions. (Dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Turkey, the Cornerstone of Near East Peace <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>This week, the Executive Yuan of the National Government decided to appoint Zhang Pengchun as the Chinese Ambassador to Turkey. Since He Yaozu returned to China, the post of Chinese envoy to Turkey has been vacant for several years. This appointment is indeed timely. As Zhang said to reporters in Chongqing, "Turkey is not only a major power in the eastern Mediterranean, but also one of the most important keys to the international situation." With Zhang's erudition and talent, he will be able to perform his duties well. The Chinese government's continued diplomatic activities while actively resisting the war are also commendable. Recently, the overall situation in Europe has become increasingly tense. After a small lull in the fighting in Norway, the development of the war has tended to shift from Northern Europe to Southeastern Europe, which has further increased Turkey's importance.</p>
<p>Turkey was originally a large empire in the Near East. Since the 18th century, internal political and religious corruption and external encroachment by the great powers led to a decline in the country's strength. During the First World War, Turkey assisted Germany and Austria against Britain and France. After its defeat, it was forced to sign the Treaty of Sèvres, which almost lost all its territory outside Asia Minor. However, the Turkish people, under the leadership of the late President Kemal, were finally able to defeat Greece in battle and sign the Treaty of Lausanne. Except for Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Egypt, it restored other old territories and abolished all unequal treaties. At the same time, it worked hard to reform its internal affairs and develop its economy. The country's strength has been increasing day by day, and it has become the most powerful leading country on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The revival of Turkey was not only due to its arduous military struggle, but also to its skillful use of diplomacy. For the past 20 years, Turkey has consistently maintained peace as its core principle in its international relations. Therefore, in 1925, it signed a treaty of neutrality and mutual guarantee with the Soviet Union. In 1928, it signed a treaty of friendship and arbitration with Italy. In 1934, it signed the Balkan Pact with Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania to maintain the status quo in Southeastern Europe. In 1937, it signed the Middle East Pact with Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan to protect the security of West Asia. As a result of the Montreux Convention in 1936, Turkey was able to recover the rights of armament and control of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits, which further increased its responsibility for maintaining peace in Eastern Europe and its importance in the international arena.</p>
<p>Therefore, after Germany and Italy successively annexed Czechoslovakia and Albania by force last spring, Britain and France, in view of the deterioration of the European situation, not only provided security guarantees to Romania and Greece, but also conducted negotiations with Turkey. As a result, the British-Turkish negotiations matured in May, the French-Turkish negotiations matured in June, and the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact was finally signed in the Turkish capital on October 19. At that time, the European war had already broken out for more than a month, and Turkey still resolutely joined hands with Britain and France, preparing to jointly resist aggression. At the same time, Turkey has been able to maintain its friendship with the Soviet Union; even with Germany and Italy, it has never categorically refused to speak to them, but publicly stated that the status quo of the Balkan countries must be respected. From all this, we can see Turkey's courageous attitude, pure stand, and flexible diplomacy, all of which have superior performances. The fact that the southeastern corner of Europe, with its many small and weak countries, has not yet fallen into the hands of the god of war is due to many factors, but Turkey has played a key supporting role. Because what Germany and Italy are most concerned about in the Balkans and the Near East is Turkey, and what Britain and France rely on most to fulfill their security guarantees to Greece and Romania is also Turkey, especially the British and French navies, which must pass through the two Turkish straits to reach the Romanian ports. At the end of March this year, senior representatives from Britain, France, and Turkey held a military conference in Aleppo, Syria, and reached a complete compromise on measures to be taken by the three countries in the event of a war expanding to the Near East. This shows Turkey's firm belief in maintaining peace in the Near East, which can be called the cornerstone of Near East peace, and is by no means an overstatement.</p>
<p>The European war is currently brewing new changes. The German army has made considerable progress in Norway, but this is not enough to eliminate Germany's difficulties or meet Germany's needs. If Germany wants to invade Sweden, it cannot but take the Soviet Union into account. The economic negotiations between the Soviet Union and Sweden have just begun, which, from a certain perspective, can be seen as a diplomatic posture of the Soviet Union warning Germany. Because Germany's economic difficulties must be resolved; the resources of the Balkans have long been coveted by Germany, so it is very likely that Germany's direction of development will shift to Southeastern Europe in the near future. The German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, was recently summoned back to Germany; the British and French joint fleet has also arrived in Egypt; Italy's attitude has not diminished its ambiguity. All these subtle dynamics symbolize the increasing tension in the Near East, and Turkey's measures are of great importance. It is expected to become the center of attention for the whole world in an instant.</p>
<p>China and Turkey have a long history of relations, with close blood ties and good diplomatic relations. In this dramatic global situation, China is the vanguard of resistance to aggression in the Far East, while Turkey is the cornerstone of peace in the Near East. I therefore take Zhang Pengchun's appointment to Turkey as an opportunity to discuss the relationship between Turkey and the overall European situation as above. With today's advanced science and convenient transportation, peace has become indivisible and the world has become one. Although China and Turkey are separated by the East and the West, their goals of struggle are the same and their aspirations are united. If they can join hands to work together, they will surely be able to bring about the arrival of success earlier, and those who benefit will be not only China and Turkey.</p>

<p>Rangoon: A Ministry of National Defense communiqué today mentioned the fire that destroyed six supply depots at the Chinese armory in the Chih-fang (transliterated) area of the Yunnan-Burma Road, saying that there was suspicion of sabotage by traitors. Chinese officials denied that it was caused by a Japanese air raid. Two Chinese soldiers and 25 laborers were killed. 12 laborers are still missing and 6 were seriously injured. 20 British nationals were injured, 18 of whom have been sent to the Lashio Hospital, but none have died. After the armory disaster, there are two large holes on the ground that are 60 feet wide and 30 feet deep. The town of Chih-fang was not badly damaged, nor was the hospital. The ceiling of the tropical disease research laboratory run by Americans collapsed, destroying several microscopes. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The mayor of Chongqing made a broadcast to the United States this morning, claiming that Chongqing is fully prepared for future Japanese air raids, and that the citizens of Chongqing do not need to be assembled in one place during air raids as they were a year ago. The result of the Japanese air raids in various parts of Free China is only to make the Chinese people have an unshakable belief and will to resist the war, and will never cause the Chinese people to be afraid. The Japanese bombing of Chongqing has two purposes: one is to create chaos and unrest in Chongqing, and the other is to make the Chinese people afraid so that they can surrender to them. But the Japanese have failed in both of these attempts. The chaos and unrest that occurred after the first air raid on Chongqing lasted only one night. The Japanese have actually taught the Chinese people how to defend themselves. Countless caves and air-raid shelters have been built, and people's houses have also been built outside the city. The people of the whole country are now united as one to resist the inhuman and barbaric forces. (United Press)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Central Government's Appointment of Four Chairmen is of Great Significance <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese government's announcement of the appointment of the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces has aroused great interest among people here. The new chairmen are: Wan Fulin of Liaoning Province, Zou Zuohua of Jilin Province, Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province, and Miao Zhenliu of Rehe Province. There is no official explanation regarding this matter, but it is generally believed that the Chinese government's appointment of the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces at this time is intended to clearly show its policy of not recognizing "Manchukuo" and still regarding the four northeastern provinces as a part of China. This move is of great significance, because there have been rumors that China may agree to recognize "Manchukuo" as one of the final peace conditions. It is said that the people of the four northeastern provinces have applied to have the affairs of the four northeastern provinces handled by people from the province in the future. The Chinese government's move is an official recognition of the above application, because the new chairmen of the four provinces are all former subordinates of Zhang Xueliang. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Talk by the Secretary-General of the National Defense Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper in Chongqing reported that the National Government ordered the appointment of Wan Fulin and others as chairmen of the Liaoning and other provincial governments. The reporter therefore visited Secretary-General Zhang of the Supreme National Defense Committee and received the following statement. Since the September 18th Incident, the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the compatriots in these provinces who are groaning in misery, and is constantly planning to recover them. The compatriots throughout the country hold the righteous indignation of common hatred, and the anti-Japanese sentiment is getting stronger and stronger. Since the July 7th Incident, the Chinese side has been united and united in sincerity, and the long-term and comprehensive war of resistance has lasted for three years. The Chinese army has been fighting one after another, getting stronger and stronger. The Japanese army has fallen into a situation where it cannot advance or retreat. The Chinese side's confidence in winning the war of resistance has been strengthened by this. It is actively planning to recover all lost land in order to maintain the integrity of the territory. In order to meet the needs of the facts, the military and political affairs of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces should be the responsibility of senior officials. Comrades Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Ma Zhanshan, and Miao Zhenliu have long been famous and have made great efforts to plan the major affairs of each province. Therefore, the government ordered them to preside over the provincial administration separately. Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces are habitually referred to as the three eastern provinces due to geographical and historical reasons. In order to actively plan the party and government affairs and military affairs of the three provinces, the Military Affairs Commission will set up a war zone party and government committee, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang branch, to concentrate the strength of the three provinces and carry out recovery. The party and government affairs and military affairs of Rehe will be planned by a certain war zone branch in the vicinity. (Dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Chinese government has now decided to allocate 20 million yuan for agricultural loans in Northwest China, with Gansu as the center, in order to create a natural granary adapted to wartime needs. According to official sources, the government has designed six state-run farms in Gansu. In addition to poppies, rice grains have also been planted. The future harvest is expected to ensure the food security of the 3 million people in Gansu. At the same time, this loan may help develop the inland industry of Gansu, because in the past year, the province produced only 5% of the industrial products consumed in Gansu.

<p>Guangzhou: The Pearl River is now open to the outside world under various restrictions. The customs here has resumed its work. Baggage inspection, which was carried out by the police, is now done by customs officials themselves. The small boats and other items originally belonging to the customs have now been returned by the Japanese. It has been two weeks since the Pearl River was announced to be open, but the British ships that arrive in Guangzhou once a week have not carried any cargo to and from. It is reported that the Taikoo Dockyard is not accepting cargo because the authorities here require the dock workers employed by the firm to be those designated by them. It is also reported that the Hong Kong authorities have not yet had British ships carry cargo to Guangzhou. The reasons are unknown, but it is heard that this is related to the status of the Guangdong Customs in Hong Kong. It is rumored that the Guangdong Customs has set up an office in Hong Kong to handle applications for transporting goods into Guangdong, so that these applications are no longer handled by the Maritime Customs Commissioner in Hong Kong, and that these applications must first be appraised by the Customs Superintendent before they can be approved by the Commissioner. This is the biggest obstacle to the restoration of foreign trade. This approach has caused inconvenience, and the Customs Superintendent, who has a political position, will also abuse his power. In general, there are many restrictions, and Huangpu is still blocked, so the opening of the Pearl River to third countries is just an empty gesture. Although some people believe that this is the first step in gradually restoring normal commercial procedures, many conveniences, such as the unrestricted sailing of foreign ships, the non-interference of the powers of the Customs and the Commissioner, and the improvement of berthing methods, must be restored one by one before the first stage of commercial revival can be achieved.

The main points of the draft are that small industrial and commercial enterprises that produce daily necessities and are certified by the industry association can apply for loans from local financial institutions. Small commercial loans can reach 5,000 yuan, and small industrial loans can reach 20,000 yuan. The maximum interest rate is no more than 9% per month. (Dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e21">U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Continued Gold Purchases, Gold Reserves Reach $18.6 Billion, To Be Used After the War to Heal the Wounds <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in a speech at the Democratic Women's Association, stated that the current European war would inflict significant economic damage on countries around the world. The United States currently has $18.6 billion in gold reserves, which will be used after the war to heal the wounds. The Treasury Department is currently purchasing large amounts of gold, which is the right thing to do. Once the madness and destructive force of the war comes to an end, the United States will be able to leverage its gold reserves and fulfill its mission in the reconstruction effort. A portion of the gold reserves will automatically flow back to foreign countries because once peace is restored, the confidence of capitalists in various countries will also be restored, thereby withdrawing their funds deposited in the United States. Another portion can be used to develop American import trade without hindering domestic business activities. The remaining portion can be invested in foreign countries when American capitalists have security guarantees. "In short, we must dedicate ourselves to a dual responsibility: to promote the recovery of all industries and to assist foreign countries in restoring peace and security, as prosperity, peace and security are the supreme goals of American policy." Morgenthau then strongly defended the current monetary policy, stating that among the currencies of all countries in the world, the American currency is the soundest, and in recent years, it has gradually become an international currency. "We must continue to accept the gold flowing into the United States from foreign countries. This is the only sound policy. If gold stops flowing in, international exchange rates and American business will be completely disrupted, and domestic unemployment will inevitably increase significantly. After foreign countries establish lasting peace and a stable economy, the gold problem can be automatically resolved." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>New York: U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declared last night at a political rally that, personally, he would rather have gold than foreign paper money. The U.S. dollar has a huge gold reserve, so it is the most stable currency in the world. Germany and other countries are planning to use barter methods to conduct trade to replace the free exchange of gold regulation. In fact, barter is a worse method. The reason why Germany and other countries adopt this method is not because they distrust gold, but simply because they lack gold. He believes that if one or two dictators were to rule most of the world, the future value of gold would be threatened, but he is definitely not worried that this will ever happen. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

The Foreign Ministry also said that Foreign Minister Arita may host a banquet for Sayre on Monday. Meanwhile, the Asahi Shimbun commented on Grew's announcement of postponing his trip to the United States, saying that the change in the U.S. Ambassador's plan was due to the lack of improvement in U.S.-Japan relations. Because the current situation in the Far East does not allow Ambassador Grew to leave his post.

According to Edison, who returned a few days ago from inspecting naval exercises in the Pacific, aircraft currently have a temporary advantage over warships, but this advantage can be eliminated by improving the warship's structural design. In the past, sufficient attention was not paid to the protection of sailors and weaponry on deck. In the future, we will find ways to remove various gears that can be shattered by bombs or artillery shells. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>The Hague: Foreign observers here recently said that the U.S. and Japanese governments recently issued declarations stating their positions on the issue of the Dutch East Indies, which the Dutch people welcomed, because maintaining the status quo in the Pacific is in the common interest of both the U.S. and Japan. Although the general public inevitably feels uneasy about the future of the East Indies, the Dutch government is currently working to develop relations with the United States in all aspects, even studying how to open a direct U.S.-Dutch airline route after the war. A Dutch association has recently been established in New York, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies have successively given broadcast speeches to the American people to enhance friendly relations between the two countries. As mentioned earlier, Dutch authorities are currently hoping that American public opinion will become increasingly concerned about the fate of the Netherlands and its territories in the Indian Ocean and the Western Hemisphere. As far as the Netherlands itself is concerned, people here believe that America's aversion to all acts of aggression is one of the guarantees of Dutch security. Although they do not believe that Germany's aggressive intentions can be dispelled by this, they still hope that the Nazi Party authorities will hesitate due to concerns about American intervention, so as to take advantage of this breathing opportunity to make preparations in military and diplomatic terms as much as possible. As far as the Dutch East Indies are concerned, the general public has more specific hopes for the United States, because they know that these islands have always supplied the United States with various essential raw materials, especially tin and rubber, so the United States cannot ignore them. In any case, in view of the precarious international situation, the Dutch government has decided to build three battlecruisers for the territory, each with a displacement of 27,000 tons. However, these warships will not be completed until 1945 or 1946. Before their completion, the confrontation between the U.S. and Japan must be used to maintain the security of these islands. What is worrying is that Japan may disregard everything and launch a surprise attack because it urgently needs various raw materials. In short, Dutch authorities are currently closely watching the tense situation between the U.S. and Japan, especially the movements of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, because every move of these countries is enough to have a significant impact on the Dutch East Indies.

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt told a regular press conference yesterday that the United States is now eagerly seeking activities to prevent the European war from extending to Italy and the Mediterranean. He said that the United States has always been trying to contain the expansion of the European war, but he has not mentioned whether his current efforts for peace are related to his personal intervention in the previous crises before the outbreak of the European war. A senior official of the State Department said, "The situation in the Mediterranean seems extremely bad."

<p>Paris: Italy's attitude towards the current European war was somewhat chaotic due to the German propaganda machine's misleading coverage. But since the U.S. government inquired about Italy's true intentions through diplomatic channels, the situation has been clarified, and rumors that Italy was about to take action in the Balkans have been dispelled. Political figures here are therefore satisfied and said that if Italy does fight alongside Germany, the United States will inevitably implement the current Neutrality Act in the Mediterranean, which would be equivalent to a complete economic blockade of Italy. If Italy wants to obtain raw materials, it will inevitably seek them from the Soviet Union. In other words, the country will be forced to form a triangular alliance with Germany and the Soviet Union, which has always been a path the country has feared. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>English and French Control of the Mediterranean Entrances Provokes Intense Resentment in Italian Public Opinion</p>
<p>Rome: The reinforcement of naval power by the British and French navies in the Mediterranean has been commented on by fascist newspapers, which said that this was directed against Italy, but no matter what kind of threat, Italy can deal with it. Renowned journalist Gayda published an article in the semi-official Italian Daily, stating, "The British and French navies are concentrated in the Mediterranean based on a common political plan, which is aimed at our country and is already commonplace in our country, so the attitude is extremely calm, and they are continuing to freely promote their policies, with the goal of protecting their legitimate interests and maintaining what they consider to be the highest interests of Europe. However, if the purpose of this abnormal and mysterious display of military power by the British and French navies is to launch an offensive attempt to divert attention and revitalize the prestige of England and France politically and militarily, Italy will inevitably cause a swift and tough reaction."

The German press and political circles are still attacking Britain, accusing it of deliberately expanding the scope of the war, but they are uneasy about where the Allied forces will be used after withdrawing from central Norway. The newspapers also said that the situation in the Mediterranean will be closely watched by Germany. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Newspapers here recently published a dispatch from Berlin saying that German political figures are now eager to know "now that the Norwegian front has become a German front, where will the British troops attack again?" In other words, Norway has become a German protectorate, and it is unknown which country Germany will place under its protection. Currently, the Nazi Party is accusing Britain of intending to expand the scope of the war and said that Germany will never be taken advantage of by Britain and will preemptively strike, just like it did in Norway. Neutral observers in Berlin are quite uneasy about this attitude and fear that Germany may take action in Southeastern Europe, but the Netherlands and Belgium may not be able to rest easy. The Essen National Daily (the organ of Aviation Minister General Goering) reported that Britain and the Soviet Union are again confronting each other in the East, because Turkey is clearly leaning towards Britain and France, which has caused the Montreux Convention (the convention on the re-fortification of the Dardanelles Strait) to lose its basis in spirit. The Soviet Union cannot tolerate this for long and wants to seize the port of Istanbul in Turkey and place the Dardanelles Strait under its absolute control. Although France has stationed a large army in the Near East and appointed veteran General Weygand as its commander, the Soviet Union has already made preparations. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>Alexandria: Alexandria, which is now more important than Malta, is in a state of "absolute readiness." After a squadron of Allied warships arrived yesterday, the coastal artillery and anti-aircraft artillery are now defended by soldiers. Military aircraft have temporarily suspended flights so that aircraft and personnel can be immediately summoned, and military police leave have also been suspended. Other precautions include "Desert Watch Posts," that is, from the western edge of Egypt, across the Sahara to the Nile Delta, two Egyptian sentries are stationed at intervals, with telephone lines connected. Alexandria is the main port of Egypt, located on a narrow strip of land separating the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Mariout. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Alexandria: A Reuters special correspondent took an Air Force patrol plane to meet the Allied fleet. It is said that the Allied fleet that entered Alexandria yesterday was the strongest fleet to sail through the Mediterranean, proving that Britain is not only able to protect its rights in the Mediterranean but also has the determination to protect them when necessary. Among the fleet that arrived here, there are several battleships, escorted by cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. They are lined up in a long line from the port of Alexandria, stretching as far as the eye can see. This is only the vanguard fleet, and a larger naval force will follow. This is bound to have a calming and profound impact in the central and eastern Mediterranean. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Italy Provides Guarantees to Yugoslavia <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Continue to Implement Cooperative Policies Based on the Treaty of Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government has solemnly provided guarantees to the Yugoslav authorities, stating that Italy will continue to implement a policy of cooperation based on the agreement signed by the two countries in March 1937. However, the recent distribution of anti-Italian leaflets in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia has left a bad impression on Italy, and the Yugoslav authorities should pay attention to this. For the sake of friendly relations between the two countries, it is necessary to take the necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Regarding this matter, according to observers, U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips recently inquired with the Italian authorities about the country's intentions regarding the current European war. The Italian authorities immediately expressed their views on this. Afterwards, there were still rumors that Italy would take interventionist action against Yugoslavia. Italy then reiterated the above-mentioned guarantees to the Yugoslav government. Insiders said that from a military and political point of view, it would be useless for Italy to interfere in Yugoslavia, because since the country occupied Albania, all the important ports along the Adriatic coast have actually been under Italian control, and it is unnecessary to do more. However, the recent policy trends of Yugoslavia have indeed caused Italy to feel doubts. For example, former Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović, who was regarded as a strong supporter of the Rome-Berlin Axis, was recently arrested by the Yugoslav authorities, which made the Italian side feel uncomfortable. Secondly, Yugoslavia's economic negotiations with the Soviet Union also made Italy uneasy, deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's expansion of power in the Balkans. In short, Italy deeply hopes that Yugoslavia can avoid taking any actions that could harm their relationship. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Although the Italian side has expressed that they have no other intentions regarding rumors that Italy will abandon its non-belligerent status in the current European war, the Yugoslav authorities are currently continuing to strengthen their defenses, reportedly to cope with all unexpected events.

<h3 id="e30">Simon's Speech on the Norwegian War Situation: Acknowledging Germany's Strength Cannot Be Underestimated; Britain Seeks Victory Regardless of Sacrifice; Labour Party Announces New Post-War Political Program <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London: At a Liberal Party gathering last night, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon spoke, expressing the Liberal Party's determination to support the war effort through hardship and toil until the threat to human freedom is eliminated. Simon described the course of the war, saying it has taught three lessons: first, the enemy's capabilities cannot be ignored. Britain has never made the mistake of underestimating the enemy's capabilities. Eight months after the start of the war, and before the decisive battle has even begun, we understand that we must face a strong enemy, organized and prepared to fight to the end, and overthrow them. Second, the unprecedented unity and determination of the British people and overseas dominions to face a strong enemy. The British nation loves peace, and unless there is a thorough judgment and awareness of the need to wage war at any cost, no power in the world could drive the British people into the flames of a great war. The full crisis of the war may not be understood for some time, but Germany's actions have placed Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand at the side of the mother country, jointly waging a difficult war arising from a tyrant's determination to destroy world peace. France's response is the same as Britain's, also producing the same unity. Third, this war is a war to defend the common freedom of mankind. This is most evident. We believe in freedom, abhor war, and are unwilling to waste national resources when human destiny and normal peaceful conditions urgently need improvement. Now, we must declare that no sacrifice is too great to eliminate the threat to freedom. No matter what the situation, we are willing to persevere through hardship until the day of victory. Simon then made two points regarding the debate in Parliament next week concerning the Norwegian war situation. First, based on the detailed information available to wartime cabinet members, he is confident that impartial public opinion, when understanding the full situation, will believe that the government's actions were appropriate and based on the best strategy. Second, if anyone singles out one or two cabinet members for criticism, or distinguishes between cabinet members, it will cause disappointment because, in fact, there is no room for such criticism. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: Labour Party leader Attlee spoke at a dinner in London last night, saying, "I believe the people will demand brave, resolute, and efficient individuals to lead us through this difficult situation. I expect the people will respond. We in the labour movement will devote our abilities to this end. I believe that if the people are guaranteed that all sacrifices will be equal and without favouritism, they are prepared to make great sacrifices. I believe that Britain has not yet actively utilized its manpower and material resources. I also do not see that British land is fully utilized, or that private interests are subordinate to public welfare. Today is a time of great concern. The news of the British withdrawal from southern Norway is startling, and those who cherish extravagant hopes and do not understand the truth are particularly shocked. The Labour Party will demand a detailed explanation from the government on Wednesday. The British determination to defeat Hitlerism will not change due to another setback." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: The Labour Party has recently published a new declaration of the Labour Party's wartime and post-war domestic policies, including the statement that a socialist Britain is not an unattainable utopia but an ideal nation that can be realized in our time. It also briefly outlines its plan, which it believes is necessary to achieve economic justice and social welfare, and states that it rejects any demands for dictatorship, whether from the left or the right. If public opinion is respected, we are confident that the history of parliamentary democracy can lead the nation forward from a society of acquisitiveness to a socialist society. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Moscow: Dutch newspapers and some foreign newspapers have recently claimed that "last week, the Soviet Union sent a note to the German government, stating that if Germany takes action against Sweden, the Soviet Union will consider it an unfriendly act. At the same time, the Soviet Union will not allow Germany to occupy the Åland Islands."</p>
<p>This report has been solemnly denied here by the authorities, and TASS has also been authorized to declare that the report does not correspond to the facts. In fact, two weeks ago, Soviet and German representatives exchanged information on the issue of Swedish neutrality in Moscow (this action was carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact for mutual exchange of information and discussion). During the exchange of information, both sides expressed their attention to upholding Swedish neutrality. (TASS, 4th)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that Sweden has begun trade negotiations with the Soviet Union and has requested Germany to use the Kiel Canal as a sea route for Swedish transportation to the United States and South America. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Political figures here recently said that the withdrawal of Allied forces from the central Norwegian front has created a pessimistic impression in Sweden, and therefore the country may change its policy and try to establish an understanding with Germany. It is reported that the German government has proposed to Sweden that the two sides conclude a political and economic agreement to facilitate the transportation of Swedish iron ore to Germany and promote general relations between the two countries. How the Swedish government will respond is not yet known here. However, on the other hand, the Soviet Union supports Sweden's strict adherence to neutrality, and the Soviet Union would not be happy if Sweden became too close to Germany. Therefore, British authorities are paying attention to Moscow's reaction and closely monitoring the evolution of Swedish policy. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>London: Responsible sources in London explicitly stated that although the Allied forces have withdrawn from northern Norway, they plan to continue fighting with great force. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: A radio station here recently announced that the war in the port of Narvik is still raging. The focus of the war is in the town of Elveneset, south of the port. Allied reinforcements have already arrived to reinforce it. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to a local radio station, Colonel Getz, commander of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area (including the two districts of Trondheim, north and south, and Namsos), has issued an order announcing that he wants to request a local truce with the German forces. Because after the withdrawal of the Allied forces, the positions of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area are difficult to defend. Continuing to fight in this situation would only lead to tragedy and would be of no practical benefit. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The Jemtland Tidning newspaper published an order issued by Colonel Getz, commander of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area, which stated that the German forces have reached the flanks and rear of the defending forces. Since external assistance is impossible, and aircraft and other necessary weapons are lacking, continuing to fight would only cause unnecessary sacrifices for everyone. Therefore, he has made a proposal for a truce to the German commander. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The "Norwegian News Agency" declared that, according to a responsible source, the rumour that Colonel Getz, commander of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area, requested a truce is purely local in nature and only applies to the Norwegian forces under his command. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The British War Office recently announced that the Allied forces in Namsos, in accordance with the overall plan to withdraw from the vicinity of Trondheim, re-embarked on Thursday night and withdrew without loss. As for the northern port of Narvik, the enemy launched repeated counterattacks on the 1st and 2nd of this month, but were repulsed by the Allied forces, leaving behind many corpses and many prisoners of war. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources, Lieutenant General Paget, commander of the British Army in the Trondheim area, suggested in his plan for the withdrawal of the British Army from Åndalsnes that all Norwegian forces should withdraw together with the British forces and be transferred to other areas of operations decided by the Norwegian General Headquarters. The British authorities have agreed to this suggestion and issued the necessary instructions. However, how many Norwegian forces have been planned to be transferred to other places is not yet known in London. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The War Office recently issued a communiqué stating that "the rumour that the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief was unaware of the Allied withdrawal from the Trondheim area, and that he was negotiating a truce with the Germans, is not true. In fact, he and his staff boarded a British warship last night." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to neutral military observers here, northern Norway is still an extremely important naval base for the Allied powers. If the Allied forces want to maintain their blockade of Germany and prevent German transportation in the Atlantic, the occupation of northern Norway is even more necessary when the German forces control central and southern Norway. The German forces have now achieved their first goal, which is to obtain a sea and air base to attack Britain and the North Sea. However, their second goal, which is to break the Allied blockade, may not be achieved for a while, as the area north of Bodø is still controlled by the Allied forces and the Norwegian army. Therefore, the Allied forces can mobilize the troops in that area to reoccupy and hold Narvik, which can also be assisted by the Norwegian 6th Division, which currently has more than 23,000 people.

They have been fighting in terrible conditions for a week, trudging through snow that is waist-deep. Their hands are frozen and they can hardly hold their guns. As soon as they leave their hidden trenches, they run the risk of being mercilessly machine-gunned by German aircraft. According to General Veale, his troops fought very bravely and slept in the snow at night until it was no longer possible to stand firm in Steinkjer. The correspondent also said that German aircraft dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs, turning Steinkjer into a fiery hell. It is impossible for any human being to remain there. The morale of the troops has never been seen to be discouraged. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>London: Responsible sources have declared that after a large squadron of British Blenheim aircraft attacked the German airfield in Stavanger, British aircraft returned to the airfield several hours later and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs like rain. The airfield has become a "fiery hell." This was the ninth air raid on the airfield in two days. The German defenses were attacked, and their resistance was significantly weakened. Therefore, there was little resistance to this British attack. All of the bombs dropped by the British aircraft hit their targets, causing many large fires. Most of the houses around the aircraft landing area were burned down, and large fires were also seen to break out at other locations where German aircraft were parked. British aircraft also attacked Fornebu, where they encountered more resistance than before, with heavy anti-aircraft fire. The British aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs and saw four explosions near the main hangar, causing significant damage to the hangar. At the same time, British air force bombers patrolled the skies over the German Frisian Islands to prevent German seaplanes from flying far to the British coast to lay mines. These bombers encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire in several locations. When the British aircraft attacked, they saw three German aircraft and one fighter immediately flee. No British aircraft were injured or killed during last night's operations. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Moscow: The Red Star newspaper, the organ of the People's Committee for Defense of the Soviet Union, today published a special article entitled "Disputes in the Japanese Ruling Camp," which stated that the Japanese political situation is extremely unstable and that some Japanese newspapers are predicting that the life of the Yonai Cabinet is nearing its end. Although the ruling class is trying to conceal the disputes in domestic politics, the government's crisis has proven its internal instability. The official propaganda that the Sino-Japanese war has made Japan "united" is actually a fabrication. Even Fumimaro Konoe and others have had to admit that differences of opinion have arisen in political circles. The so-called "unity of views on diplomacy and domestic politics" is nothing more than empty words. Japan's capitalist monopoly has no policy to speak of. If there is one, it only represents the conflict of interests between major enterprises and bankers. During this wartime period, the struggle between the financial and industrial sectors is particularly acute, and public dissatisfaction and anti-war movements have also occurred. These serious facts have all been caused by the war and cannot be denied by Japanese imperialists. (3rd)</p>

However, after investigations by the Resource Committee and other parties in recent years, it has been discovered that many other provinces also have gold resources.</p>
<p>The important gold-producing areas in northern China used to be Mohe, Heihe, Suifenhe, and Aihun in Heilongjiang Province; Sannianhe and Jiapigou in Jilin Province; and Tieling, Bailegou, and the Xing'an region in Liaoning Province. Now it is known that there are also Pingquan and Chaoyang in Rehe Province; Xinglong Daoliushui and Malanta in Zunhua; Miyun and Changping in Hebei Province; and Zhaoyuan, Yishui, and Linyi in Shandong Province. As for the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the important gold-producing areas include Songpan and Suijing in Sichuan Province; Yanyuan, Mianning, Kangding, and Daofu in Xikang Province; Dieyuan and Ledu in Qinghai Province; Taoyuan, Yuanling, and Pingjiang in Hunan Province; and Shanglin and Wuming in Guangxi Province. In addition, placer gold deposits have been found along the river basins of the Minjiang, Tuojiang, Jialingjiang, Dadu River, and Jinsha River in Sichuan Province; the Nujiang, Lancangjiang, and Jinsha River in Yunnan Province; the Datong River and Huang River in Qinghai Province; the Han River in Shaanxi and Hubei Provinces; and the Dan River in Henan Province.</p>
<p>Southwest Provinces: Gold Mine Areas</p>
<p>Sichuan Province has many placer gold mines, and their distribution is very wide. Several state-owned mining areas have been designated in the Zhangla area of Songpan County for exploration and mining. According to statistics, the average annual output is about 20,000 taels.</p>
<p>In Xikang Province, several state-owned mining areas have also been designated in Kangding, Taining, Daofu, and Yuhe for preliminary exploitation. According to statistics from the past two years, the annual output is about 20,000 taels.</p>
<p>Hunan Province has many mountain gold mines, and the area is very large. Under the joint operation of the provincial and central governments, the annual output is at least 12,000 taels.</p>
<p>In Qinghai Province, several state-owned mining areas have been surveyed in Yuan County, Yong'an City, Zhuanfeng Kiln, and Shipozhuang in Ledu County for exploration and mining. In addition, state-owned areas have also been surveyed in Xiakou in Gonghe County, Hualong Kejiangou in Hualong County, and Xiamen in Minhe County, and trial explorations have begun. There is recent hope of success. The gold output in this area is 10,000 taels per year.</p>
<p>In Guangxi Province, Shanglin County is the most prominent, with an annual gold output of over 30,000 taels. The gold mines in Guangdong Province are mostly barren, with an annual gold output of only about 2,000 taels.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been no detailed survey of gold mines in Guizhou Province, but gold mines in Fanjing Mountain in Jiangkou County and Xiajiang County are also being mined, producing several hundred taels. In Yunnan Province, there are relatively rich mineral beds on the banks of the Nujiang, Jinsha River, and Lancangjiang Rivers, and the province produces about 2,000 taels per year. In Gansu Province, the most important area is on the northern slopes of the Qilian Mountains, where the annual gold output is very small. In Yun County, Hubei Province, Ankang County, Shaanxi Province, Xichuan County, Henan Province, Liuzhougou and Jingziguan, etc., in the Han and Dan River basins, there are also placer gold mines, which are mined using traditional methods, with an annual output of more than 2,000 taels. There are also gold mines in Xinjiang Province, but there are no accurate reports on output, but it is at least over 22,000 taels per year.</p>
<p>The above are not very detailed surveys, because all the mining areas are in places with inconvenient transportation and in areas of indigenous chieftains. It is believed that there are many undiscovered rich gold mines, so surveying gold mines is a very important task at present.</p>
<p>Gold Mining Enterprises: Generally Divided into Three Types</p>
<p>Gold mining enterprises are generally divided into three types: one is government-run mines, the second is privately-run mines, and the third is free panning and mining by the people.</p>
<p>Government-run mines are operated in cooperation with the Resource Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial governments, or independently operated. There are a total of six gold mining bureaus, located in Xikang, Sichuan, Qinghai, Hunan, Henan, and Guangxi Provinces. The gold mines in Kangding, Taining, Daofu, and Yuhe in Xikang are managed by the Xikang Gold Mining Bureau. The Songpan gold mine in Sichuan is managed by the Sichuan Gold Mining Office. The gold mines in Yuan and Le in Qinghai, and the six gold mines being explored in Hualong, Gonghe, Xueshan, Datong, Xian, and Ahatu Shalong, are managed by the Qinghai Gold Mining Office. The gold mines in Taoyuan, Yuanling, and Pingjiang in Hunan are managed by the Hunan Gold Mining Exploration Team. The Shanglin gold mine in Guangxi is managed by the Pinggui Mining Department. The gold mines in Zhechuan and Jingziguan in Henan are managed by the Henan Gold Mining Exploration Team.</p>
<p>In addition, there are privately-run mines that have licenses and mining rights approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the government issued 56 new gold mining permits. In addition, there are many groups and individuals who have not applied for permits, totaling 150,000 troy ounces of gold mined by registered gold mining organizations in the 27th year. As of the end of March of the 28th year (1939), 102 privately-run gold mines have been approved and licensed, including 18 in Guangdong Province, 6 in Guangxi Province, 1 in Xikang Province, 2 in Yunnan Province, 2 in Jiangxi Province, 56 in Sichuan Province, and 17 in Hunan Province. Among them, 60 were approved before the end of the 26th year (1937). Therefore, the increase rate of privately-run licensed gold mines in the past ten months has been 140%. According to statistics from July of the 27th year to May of the 28th year, the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, purchased 143,000 troy ounces of pure gold from gold miners in various places. If this batch of gold is calculated at 200 yuan per troy ounce, its total value would be 28.6 million yuan. If this number is added to the 40,000 to 50,000 troy ounces purchased or collected privately, then the total output would be around 190,000 troy ounces, which is better than the previous annual average output of 130,000 troy ounces. From these two points, we can also see that the gold mining industry in China is moving forward. If thorough exploration and full use of machinery for mining can be achieved, then the future of the gold mining industry in China will be even more limitless.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Today is the May 5th Revolutionary Day: All Circles in Shanghai Hang Flags in Celebration; City Party Headquarters Issues a Message to the Public, Encouraging All Circles to Emulate the Spirit of the Premier <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Sun Premier taking office as the Extraordinary Grand Marshal and the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), the warlords were fighting internally, and the powers were invading externally. The people's livelihood was difficult, and the country was in danger. Premier Sun, in order to save the nation from danger and carry out the Republican revolution, disregarded the difficulties of the environment and resolutely took office as the Extraordinary Grand President on May 5th, continuing to shoulder the great cause of the revolution. This was the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, the foundation for the later Northern Expedition and the pacification of the country. All circles in the city believe that with the national crisis at hand, the War of Resistance and nation-building are waiting to be continued. In addition to hanging flags in celebration today in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the public organizations and the concession authorities, they will also emulate the lofty and great revolutionary character of the Premier, resolutely struggle, fulfill their national responsibilities, and jointly solve the national crisis and the tribulations of the nation.</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters Issues a Message to the Public</p>
<p>Today is the May 5th Revolutionary Memorial Day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a message to the public, stating: "May 5th" is the anniversary of our party's Premier Sun Yat-sen taking office as the Extraordinary Grand President. In our opinion, this "Double Fifth Festival" has the same great significance as the "Double Tenth Festival" (National Day). Because at that time, the Beiyang warlords were engaged in all kinds of lawless acts, all kinds of oppression of the people, all kinds of collusion with imperialists, and the betrayal of Chen Jiongming and others hindered the national revolution, causing chaos and bringing the country to the brink of collapse. Premier Sun was heartbroken by this situation and, based on his great fearless spirit, established the Revolutionary Government, took office as the Extraordinary Grand President, shouldered the heavy burden of the revolution, did not compromise, did not fear difficulties, and fought against the evil forces from all sides, and finally succeeded in the great cause of the revolution. Therefore, if there had been no "Double Fifth Festival" in the tenth year of the Republic, the "Double Tenth Festival" of the Xinhai Revolution would have been abandoned long ago. However, the current situation is even more terrible than in the tenth year of the Republic. When we commemorate the "Double Fifth Festival" at this time, we should emulate the fighting spirit of Premier Sun in creating the "Double Fifth Festival," firmly believe in Premier Sun's Three Principles of the People—National Salvationism, not yield, not be afraid of death, and under the wise and brilliant leadership of Generalissimo Chiang, firmly believe in the belief that the War of Resistance will be won and the nation will be built, continue to work hard, intensify our work, and only then can we be loyal followers of the Three Principles of the People. Look, Japan's economy is collapsing, Japan's politics are shaking, and Japan's army is about to be destroyed. This puppet show is a reflection of its decline. As long as the righteousness and blood of our 450 million people unite as one and build a steel-like battle line, desperately attack, and the light will be in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>The Great Alliance Encourages Loyal Comrades</p>
<p>Also, the Great Alliance of Loyal Comrades of the Kuomintang of China also issued a message to the compatriots, saying, On this day in the tenth year of the Republic of China, our party established the Revolutionary Government in Guangdong, and the Premier took office as the President, announced the protection of the Constitution, and revealed the great plan for national salvation, which is a bright and glorious page in our country's history. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, it is inspiring. Today, our country is in a difficult situation, even more so than in the past. Our President leads the whole people in striving for freedom, equality, and peace. His great achievements reflect each other. We should all strive to participate directly or indirectly in the work of resisting Japan and building the nation under the leadership of our party President and strengthen the forces of resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Deliberating on Suppressing the Price of Briquettes Actually Leads to a Quorum Failure, Causing Panic; Responsibility Lies Where It Should <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The fourth term of the Shanghai Mechanical Briquette Industry Association's cheap briquette sale is scheduled to end today. The association was originally scheduled to hold a joint meeting of factories at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss whether to continue the cheap sale and to have a public discussion on the re-increase in the price of briquettes. However, only representatives from 13 small briquette factories, such as Public, Yixin, and Beiyang, attended at the time of the meeting, so it had to be postponed.</p>
<p>Stop Selling First Upon Price Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal and Firewood Industry Federation sent a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Department and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that, according to reports from fuel retailers, major briquette factories announced that the amount of briquettes sold was full and stopped supplying retailers with briquettes from yesterday (2nd), resulting in a shortage of briquettes on the market and causing panic among users. It is requested that the authorities take measures to provide relief. In the past, before the price of millet briquettes increased, briquette factories would supply a considerable amount of briquettes to retailers to help the market and facilitate the retail purchase of users. However, now, when the price increases, the factories stop selling first, regardless of the lives of the citizens, and deliberately create a situation of panic. Their intentions are obvious.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Factory Prices Reveals Intentions</p>
<p>As for the factories' claim yesterday that the cost is huge and the factory price has suddenly increased, the purchase of coal dust is definitely not less than before this price increase. There is no reason for the cost to be high. It is heard that the daily production of briquettes in a certain large factory is more than 200 to 300 tons, but this morning it announced to retailers that it would only supply 20 tons. It is obvious that the sudden increase in factory prices and the reduction in production are intended to hoard goods. The association believes that briquettes are a daily necessity for citizens and are related to the livelihoods of member stores. It is earnestly requested that your bureau (association) promptly persuade the briquette factories to suppress the market price and supply goods as usual to stabilize the market.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Public Works Department Uses New Public Bonds to Purchase 100,000 Pounds of British Gold; It is Sufficient to Meet the British Pound Needs for This Year <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that it had learned that the Public Works Department had converted a portion of its new public bonds into British pounds before the recent depreciation of the legal tender. It purchased 50,000 pounds of British gold with cash on Monday at an exchange rate of four pence one two five. It also purchased 50,000 pounds on Tuesday. Together with the 100,000 pounds purchased at the beginning of this year, it is sufficient to meet the British pound needs in the Public Works Department's budget for this year. As for the remaining proceeds from the public bonds, part has been used to repay bank overdrafts, and some has been set aside as working capital. According to Mr. Mu Qiu, Director of Finance of the Public Works Department, the depreciation of the legal tender on Thursday was unexpected. Therefore, he was very pleased to have purchased British gold before the depreciation of the legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Restrictions on Withdrawals Will Not Be Realized; Shanghai's Financial Stability; Sanctions on Speculation Are a Matter of Great Urgency; Foreign Exchange Evasion by the Japanese Puppet Regime Has Been Crushed <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Since the fluctuations in the black market for foreign exchange a few days ago, some people with ulterior motives have been deliberately disrupting the market, causing more and more panic. Yesterday, it happened to be Saturday, and rumors suddenly spread in the market that there would be restrictions on withdrawals. For a time, there were crowds of people rushing to withdraw money in front of major banks and money shops. Fortunately, the banks and money shops responded appropriately, and no accidents occurred. According to a financial authority yesterday, although the Shanghai financial market has been extremely chaotic recently, it is all caused by speculators deliberately disrupting the market. As for restrictions on withdrawals, although theoretically possible, they will not be realized in practice. There are three reasons for this: (1) The situation this year is different from last year. According to the general situation, the more restrictions on withdrawals, the more withdrawals there will be, and the result is more likely to cause panic. (2) Banks and money shops were very nervous in mid-June of last year because of the sudden occurrence of the event. This year, because they are prepared, they are sufficient to cope and do not need restrictions. (3) The black price of foreign exchange is now seeking its natural level and has not yet reached an absolute stable period. There will be no good results if withdrawals are restricted at this time. In short, everyone in the market knows that the tension is caused by speculative forces, and curbing speculation depends on everyone understanding their own position and defending together. According to the principles of currency and prices, when currency is concentrated in the hands of financial institutions and can be used properly, speculative funds can be reduced. On the contrary, if currency is withdrawn from financial institutions, the need for chips will increase, and the rate of circulation will also increase, making it difficult to reconcile the supply and demand of materials, which is equivalent to suicide. Some citizens only know that speculators are disrupting the market, but they do not know that curbing speculators is precisely the effort of their own efforts.</p>
<p>Committee Members of the Stabilization Committee Expressed</p>
<p>Mr. Stern, a British member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to him, the committee has not released British pounds in recent times to maintain the value of the black exchange rate, because China's foreign trade surplus has been quite large recently, and remittances from overseas Chinese have been very frequent even after the Chinese Lunar New Year. In March, remittances to China reached 35 million US dollars. According to Mr. Stern, Shanghai's industrialization has gradually shown signs of recovery in recent times, and since the outbreak of the European War last year, the export business has been particularly vigorous. This can be seen in last year's Shanghai Customs report. This spring, Shanghai's international trade increased by 88.8% compared to the same period in 1939, and in the summer, there will be significant increases in cotton textiles and other manufactured goods. Therefore, there is a good chance that the Shanghai market will improve.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Foreign Exchange Evasion by the Japanese Puppet Regime</p>
<p>Regarding the recent fluctuations in the black exchange market in this city, a highly authoritative source close to the financial authorities expressed the opinion that although the black exchange rate has fallen sharply this time, the legal foreign exchange of the Central Bank still maintains the original price of one shilling and two and a half pence. This time, the Japanese puppet regime engaged in a large amount of foreign exchange evasion in the black market in this city. In order to crack down on this conspiracy, the authorities have appropriately restricted the supply. This economic strategy is sufficient to reduce the foreign exchange gains of the large amount of legal tender that the Japanese puppet regime has plundered or seized in the occupied areas. In principle, the Chinese government can absolutely stop the expenditure of Shanghai's black exchange, but the reason for its painstaking maintenance is to take into account the trade interests of third countries such as Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Painstakingly Taking Into Account British and American Trade</p>
<p>If the Chinese government completely stops supplying Shanghai's black exchange, it will consolidate the financial foundation during the War of Resistance and be beneficial to wartime finance. First, the cessation of improper foreign exchange expenditure will reduce the outflow of funds in China, while Japan will not be able to obtain foreign exchange from the legal tender it has plundered. Second, it will prevent unnecessary imports of foreign goods, increase the export of local goods, and not only balance the national financial revenue and expenditure, but also absorb foreign exchange from abroad. However, in view of the trade with China by third countries, it is only restricting the supply and lowering the black exchange rate.</p>
<p>Financial Institutions Are Becoming More Sound</p>
<p>Therefore, the sharp contraction of the black exchange rate this time can indeed crack down on the foreign exchange evasion of the Japanese puppet regime and is not the depletion of the Equalization Fund, nor is it the devaluation of the legal tender. The Equalization Fund has not only not been depleted, but it has been decided to increase it. The reserve of the legal tender is also very sufficient, and in the future, the foundation of the legal tender will become more stable due to the reduction of foreign exchange outflow and the increase of international trade export. This is unanimously recognized by those with economic common sense. Therefore, the Chinese financial institutions will become more sound, and the national funds will become more abundant, which is beneficial to the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<p>Concession Notice; Appropriate Measures</p>
<p>As for the high price of goods in this city, it is caused by general speculators raising the price of goods without authorization and is by no means the devaluation of the legal tender. These speculators are obviously taking advantage of the current special situation in the concession, where the government's authority cannot reach, and they are seeking profit, unscrupulous, and crazy, and are harming the country. Although the black exchange rate has fallen sharply, there is no reason to raise the market price immediately, whether it is foreign goods or domestic goods. This kind of profit is also illegally obtained. The immediate emergency notice of the two concessions to crack down on illegal price increases is very appropriate.</p>

<p>French Ships Sailing in the Mediterranean are Not Allowed to Stop in Syria</p>
<p>French ships sailing on European and Far Eastern routes have had erratic schedules since the start of the European War. It is learned that the French authorities have many needs for shipping during this time of war. Therefore, French ships sailing in European countries have been suspended and requisitioned for other purposes. Those sailing on Far Eastern routes, with the exception of pure cargo ships, are scheduled to depart monthly in order to maintain service. However, due to the reduced number of ships during wartime, services will be further delayed. It is impossible to predict when ships will arrive in Shanghai, but services will not be discontinued. The reason for this is that routes will likely be changed. However, the company has not yet received official notice. According to shipping industry sources, in the past two months, French ships sailing in the Mediterranean have been ordered not to stop in French-owned Syria in Turkey. Passengers are forbidden from disembarking there. In the past, many overseas Chinese traveling to France went to Syria. However, due to the disruption of shipping, foreigners traveling there have also disappeared.</p>

<p>The ninth repayment lottery for the A, B, C, D, and E bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) Unified Public Bond has been held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee since February. The A, B, and C bonds have now been drawn. The D bonds are scheduled to be drawn at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and others have been requested to send representatives to supervise at that time. Cash payments will be made through the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, starting at the end of July.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Detention of the "Lisheng" Ship in Tianjin is of Great Significance; The Case of Smuggling Banknotes Can Be Concluded, But the Other Person Involved Has Not Been Released <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The "Lisheng" ship of Jardine Matheson, a British company, was seized by customs in Tianjin for smuggling tens of thousands of Japanese banknotes and silver dollars and was detained for investigation. It was released on the 28th and sailed back to Shanghai, arriving in port at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd) and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Search</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the ship, on its return voyage from Tianjin to Shanghai, sailed from Tianjin at 8:00 AM on the 22nd of last month and arrived at the Dalian Company Wharf near Tanggu (approximately 10:00 AM), where it docked as usual. A search was conducted by customs. During the search, many Japanese military police officers and customs search personnel boarded the ship at the same time. Approximately 38,000 yuan in Japanese banknotes, silver dollars, legal tender, and "joint banknotes" were seized on the spot. Two boatswains and six sailors were arrested on the spot.</p>
<p>Special Items</p>
<p>In addition, special items were discovered by the Japanese military police in the bathroom and toilet on the upper deck. The mess hall supervisor and the comprador leader were arrested. At the same time, the first and second compradors were also summoned to the Japanese military police headquarters for interrogation. The first and second compradors were released that night. The Japanese party responsible second comprador returned to the ship to investigate and said that they would come to the ship again at 10:00 AM the next day (the 23rd) for questioning. However, the second comprador returned to the ship and found nothing. At 10:00 AM the next morning, the Japanese military police did come to investigate again, but still found nothing.</p>
<p>Repeated Interrogations</p>
<p>The second comprador was taken away again, and after several days of interrogation, there was no confession. Afterwards, the chef's assistant in the mess hall kitchen was arrested. At 12:00 AM on the 27th, the first and second compradors, one boatswain, and two sailors were released and returned to the ship. The ship then departed from Tianjin at noon on the 28th and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the night before last. The ship was detained in Tianjin for about a week. Four sailors, one boatswain, one supervisor, and one assistant are still being detained at the Japanese military police headquarters.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Future</p>
<p>It is rumored that the sailors and boatswain are suspected of smuggling Japanese banknotes and silver dollars and can be dealt with after being detained for several months. However, the future of the supervisor and one assistant, due to special reasons, cannot be predicted. The torture suffered by the Chinese crew members of the ship when they were interrogated at the Japanese military police headquarters was unbearable by humans. This kind of pain is difficult to describe with words.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Shipping Merchants Are Not Interested in Opening the Blockade Line <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Side has Notified All Places and Determined to Open It on the 15th</p>
<p>According to a Japanese naval spokesman on the 3rd, the blockade line in the South City of the Huangpu River will be opened to third-country ships starting on the 15th of this month, and the Huangpu River water area will be opened. Ships with a draft of more than seven meters are prohibited from navigating to the five-kilometer point adjacent to the upstream Skink Shipyard near the South City blockade line. Ships with a draft of three to seven meters should navigate on the central waterway. The time of passage is from morning to evening. It is said that the blockade was set up by the Chinese authorities who sank sand ships during the August 13th Shanghai War. The Japanese side has now cleared it. As for the designation of berths inside the water city after the opening, it must be decided through negotiations between the Customs Port Affairs Department and the Japanese Navy Port Affairs Authority. All third-country ships must pass through without hindering the Japanese military principles. Mr. Miura, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, has sent letters to the Shanghai authorities and relevant parties regarding this opening message. However, because the business inside the blockade line is limited and they must be controlled by the Japanese side, and the Japanese army has the right to impose a military blockade at any time, many shipping merchants are wary and are not interested in the Japanese side's promises.</p>

<p>Due to Rising Prices of Needed Items</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department announced that, in view of the fact that the foreign exchange rate of the legal tender has fallen sharply, and the prices of imported raw materials and chemicals required by the Shanghai Customs Quarantine Station have increased, it was previously stipulated that a 30% increase should be calculated, as stated in Notice No. 7 of August 1st of the 28th year (1939). Now, due to the continued increase in the price of imported goods used in the work of the Quarantine Station, it is decided that from May 1st of this year, all the aforementioned fees will be temporarily calculated by doubling the original regulations. All shipping companies and passengers are hereby notified.</p>

<p>Searching for Guerrilla Forces; The Result is Ineffective</p>
<p>Chinese guerrilla forces are extremely active in the coastal areas of the two counties of Pudong and Nanhui Chuansha and on Chongming Island outside Songkou. Whether day or night, they openly sail boats to and from the sea, either transferring defenses or transporting military supplies. The Japanese side has no way to deal with it. It is now heard that the Japanese navy has searched for the whereabouts of the guerrilla forces several times without success. Recently, all ports in Chongming, such as Xisha, Baigang, and Haihonggang, have been blockaded, and ships are prohibited from passing through these ports. Only the ports where the original Chongming liner enters and exits can operate as usual to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Chongming. In general observation, the Chongming coast is vast, and this move is unlikely to be effective.</p>

It has been learned that the dredging operations within the Pujiang River can now be described as commencing on a small scale. The current work location is below Lujiazui in the Pujiang River, where several large dredgers are tasked with the excavation project. The "Jianshe" large dredger is currently anchored in the heart of the river opposite the Xin Kai River, as the bureau has assigned workers to conduct repairs on the ship, which are not yet completed. As for the dredging of Shentan shoal, there are currently no plans to resume it.</p>

<p>Therefore, they had no choice but to disembark and walk for about a mile to change trains. The destroyed bridge was located about two hours south of Jinan by train, but the exact location is unknown, as the train stopped late at night. When the express train reached the section of track that had been pried up, all the passengers</p>
<p>disembarked and walked.</p>
<p>They saw a large number of Japanese railway workers repairing the damaged tracks and roadbed, using gasoline welding torches to weld the rails one by one, clearly attempting to prevent the guerrillas from prying up the rails again. The bombed railway bridge was quite long and severely damaged and is</p>
<p>under urgent repair. Passengers walked for about a mile before reaching the intact railway, where they boarded another train to Bengbu, and then changed trains to Pukou. Among these foreign passengers were Ms. Weil, a buyer for a large department store in Chicago, and employees of the British American Tobacco Company.</p>

<p>New Contributions in Medicine</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Health Society held its fifth annual congress this year on the 2nd of this month at the Ge's Biological Research Institute at 18 Ferguson Road. Over a hundred members and guests from all walks of life attended. Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, the Pasteur Institute, major public health organizations, and prominent doctors were present to observe.

After lunch, a scientific discussion was held on the lawn of the institute. A paper by Dr. Xu Liangdong, a member, was read by the society's secretary. The paper detailed the spread of plague in Guangxi and the plight of victims unable to obtain effective medicine, providing a detailed report. It also covered the successful trial of the live rat vaccine he developed, with over 20,000 people having already been injected with the vaccine, each experiencing positive results. Following this, Director Ge screened various films he had personally shot, presenting to the guests step-by-step demonstrations of the production of diphtheria antitoxin, Schick toxin, and various preventive vaccines. The lighting was soft, the editing appropriate, and the demonstration of the progress of scientific research, placing the preparation of biological drugs on the right track of scientific management, deeply impressed all the guests. The fifth congress of the Public Health Society concluded successfully in an atmosphere of joy and harmony.</p>

<p>The general cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in April remained relatively stable, at 364.72, a slight decrease of 3.36 points, or 0.91%. The clothing index, however, increased sharply, reaching 342.18, a rise of 18.36%. However, since clothing expenses constitute a very small proportion of a worker's total household consumption, and the food index (357.43) decreased slightly by 2.11% compared to the previous month, the overall index did not increase. The fuel index was 470.76, down 0.81% from the previous month, and the miscellaneous items index was 285.97, up 0.37%. The purchasing power of currency this month was 27.42 cents of the legal tender for one yuan of 1936.</p>
<p>Rice Prices: This month, rice prices did not fluctuate much compared to the previous month. Saigon rice rose by 2.28%, while japonica rice and glutinous rice fell by 0.13% and 6.50% respectively. Vegetable and fish prices decreased significantly, causing the food index to decline.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices: Due to the appreciation of foreign exchange rates this month, cloth prices increased sharply. In addition, active speculation in the cotton market further fueled the price increases. The prices of all items under clothing increased, with coarse cloth, bleached cloth, flannel, and twill cloth increasing by more than 20% compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Coal Prices: The price of coal briquettes increased twice this month, first from 6.60 yuan per load to 7 yuan, and then to 7.40 yuan. On average, it increased by 13.94% compared to the previous month. The prices of firewood and charcoal decreased by 12.82% and 6.41%, respectively.</p>

<p>Five Robbers Raid a Furniture Store and Engage in a Fierce Gunfight; Four Robbers Arrested, One Killed, Western Detectives and Two Passersby Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:20 PM, a robbery occurred at the west end of Ningbo Road and Henan Road. Police and robbers exchanged gunfire five times, resulting in two deaths at the scene. The robber was injured and arrested. Additionally, at approximately 7:45 PM last night, five robbers suddenly broke into the Zhang Linji Furniture Store at 201-206 South Wuxi Road, threatening and intimidating the shop assistants and looting at will. Fortunately, a female employee shouted for help, and the neighbors reported it to the police station. Police cars quickly arrived at the scene, and Chinese and Western detectives forced their way in, leading to a fierce gunfight between detectives and robbers. Around 30 to 40 shots were fired, resulting in four robbers being captured, one killed, and one injured. Stray bullets also injured two male and female passersby. Our reporter has investigated and will provide detailed information below.</p>
<p>Employee Carrying Money Robbed En Route</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM, the Hongji Cotton Mill at 12 Jingxing Lane, Tianjin Road, sent an employee, Sheng Yinghua, to the Salt Industry Bank on Beijing Road to withdraw 1,000 yuan, and then to the Yongda Money Exchange at 24 Ningbo Road to withdraw 2,000 yuan, for a total of 4,000 yuan in legal tender. He wrapped the money in newspaper and carried it west. When he passed Henan Road, a robber suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, forcibly snatched the newspaper package, and fled. Sheng closely followed, shouting while running. Realizing the situation was dire, the robber turned around and fired a shot, hitting Sheng in the chest. Sheng continued to chase despite the pain. The robber fired another shot, hitting him in the right chest, causing him to collapse to the ground in agony, bleeding profusely. He died shortly after.</p>
<p>One Arresting Officer Killed in the Pursuit of Robbers</p>
<p>As the robber fled to the entrance of the Money Exchange Association, he was spotted by Wang Shousen, a Tianjin native and doorman of the association, who realized he was a criminal. He immediately drew his gun and gave chase. The robber passed through Jingxing Lane to 208 Tianjin Road, seeking refuge in the Qiantai Inn. The doorman pursued him, but the robber, to preemptively strike, opened fire on the arresting officer. The officer returned fire, and the two exchanged five or six shots. Wang, disregarding his safety, was shot in a vital area and died on the spot in the Qiantai Inn's courtyard.</p>
<p>Police Arrive, Robber Captured</p>
<p>Seeing the doorman dead, the robber attempted to escape. At this time, the police station received the alarm and immediately dispatched red police cars with detectives to track him down. The robber fled out of the Qiantai Inn and turned into 166 Fuxue Lane in the Lihua Silk and Cloth Shop. He rushed into the back room and quickly climbed to the second floor. Fortunately, the vigilant patrol officer in charge of Lane 766 immediately closed the lane gate to prevent the robber's escape. Detectives then captured the robber. The robber was found to have a gunshot wound on his left foot, and was only about twenty years old, wearing a gray suit. Detectives also captured two suspects nearby and brought them back to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<p>Five Robbers Suddenly Enter the Furniture Store</p>
<p>Zhang Mulin, a man from Pudong in his sixties, has operated the Zhang Linji Furniture Store at 204-206 South Wuxi Road for over forty years, and his business is thriving. At approximately 7:45 PM last night, after the shop had closed for the day, five robbers knocked on the door and entered, falsely claiming to be searching for the young master's firearms. One robber stood guard at the entrance, while the remaining robbers rushed into the shop, threatening and intimidating the nine workers and apprentices inside, tying them up one by one with ropes, and assigning one armed robber to watch over them.</p>
<p>Vigilant Maid Climbs to the Roof and Shouts for Help</p>
<p>Another robber was stationed by the staircase downstairs, while two robbers went upstairs, threatening the male and female owners with guns and beginning to loot. They snatched a diamond ring, 350 yuan in cash, two watches, a gold ring, and a gold gun piece from a foreign suitcase, with an estimated value of over 2,000 yuan. As the robbers carried the loot downstairs, their greed proved insatiable, and the two robbers went back upstairs, intending to demand more. Fortunately, a maid named Gao Sanzi (36 years old, employed for only over a month) secretly climbed onto the roof and shouted for help to the Yuantai Chang Cigarette Paper Store across the street. The store assistant used the telephone to report to the Zhabei Police Station.</p>
<p>Police Cars Arrive, Gunfight Ensues</p>
<p>Shortly after, a police car arrived, carrying dozens of armed Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers. They first cut off traffic at all surrounding intersections. A Western detective took the lead, forcing his way into the Zhang Linji Furniture Store. Detectives then swarmed in. At that time, one unarmed robber standing guard inside the door noticed the large number of detectives arriving and hid beside the furniture. The detectives did not initially notice him and rushed upstairs. The robbers upstairs, realizing they were exposed, drew their guns and resisted arrest. The detectives returned fire, and the two sides exchanged thirty to forty shots, leading to a fierce gunfight.</p>
<p>One Robber Killed, Four Robbers Captured</p>
<p>One robber, shot twice in the abdomen, jumped out of a back window, fleeing in pain to the Zhu Xinchang Clothing Store in the back alley, where he collapsed, bleeding profusely. He died shortly after. A portion of the stolen goods, including 58 yuan in legal tender, a gold ring, two watches, and a gold key piece, was found in his pocket. Another robber, Gong Zhitang, 20 years old, sustained gunshot wounds to his hands and feet and was taken to the police hospital for treatment. The remaining three robbers were arrested at the store. A Western police officer also sustained a gunshot wound to his hand. Two male and female passersby, Ji Yichang (30 years old), were shot in the head, neck, and left shoulder, and Zhao Li (26 years old), was shot in the back. They were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

They threatened and intimidated the staff, resulting in the theft of 3,000 yuan in legal tender. They fled with the stolen goods without a trace. The store owner reported the incident to the Lujiawan Police Station and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>Zhou Jishan (26 years old) of Shaoxing snuck into the Lao Baofeng Jewelry Store at 1177 Xiaoshadu Road at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday. He asked clerk Yao Lianqing to show him two new-style rings under the pretense of exchanging them for purchase. Seizing the opportunity, he snatched them and fled. Clerk Yao apprehended him and handed him over to Chinese Constable No. 2572, who transferred him to the First Special Court.

<p>Dr. Yan Kanghou, a specialist in visual education, was one of the first people in China to study this topic at Columbia University in the United States. Though Mr. Gao studied this topic earlier, he quit before graduating to seek his fortune. Thus, the two men were the only two people to study this topic in the early days. After working in Beijing and Tianjin, Mr. Yan went overseas in 1918 to study on his own dime. After returning to China, he began to put his skills to work in Shanghai, and for a long time was well-regarded by the academic community. Now, his first location, the Cishu Building, is becoming too small. Thus, he has opened Juemin Optical Company at 774 Nanjing Road, next to the Zhabei Police Station, to help people correct misaligned eyes, adjust poor eyesight habits, and other abnormalities. He does not charge for standard eye exams and fittings, so that he can share his services. He has recently compiled a monthly periodical titled "Random Notes on Visual Education" that speaks specifically to scientific common sense about visual education. The first issue has already been published, and he is gifting it to all communities.</p>

<p>Guo Shaowen, the head of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall in the French Concession, took over the position in the early winter of 1924 and has been making every effort to organize charitable acts for the Hall. During the August 13th Incident, he also made great efforts to support burial work and was even more enthusiastic. He also supervised and led the staff to record detailed information on unclaimed corpses received by the Hall's attached autopsy center, so that the corpse's family would later be able to come and claim it. His drive and spirit were deeply admired by all communities. He unfortunately died suddenly of hemoptysis on February 23 of this year, lasting only two days. The Hall’s fellow members were filled with regret. His descendants, Jing Su, Li Xun, and Shi Quan, are holding a funeral ceremony today at the Jingtu Zen Temple on Guling Road, with a memorial tablet. It is expected that there will be a lively scene of white horses and plain carriages at that time.</p>

<p>Since some merchants in this city began to engage in the business of buying pawn tickets, the transaction of buying and selling pawn tickets has developed and nearly become a legitimate business. These shops that redeem pawned items on behalf of customers are lined up next to each other on busy streets, and they open one after another. However, there are many abuses in this business, and it has become a new way for thieves to sell stolen goods. The French Concession Police Department has already detained and fined some of these shops earlier this month, (however, those with larger scales that display jewelry, gold, and silver in a way that makes them seem like silver shops are still in existence). The Shanghai Municipal Council is also aware of this situation and, after detailed investigation, has decided to ban this practice and announced it yesterday: "In order to announce this matter, it is hereby announced that starting from the date of publication of this announcement, this Bureau prohibits the purchase and sale of pawn tickets or conducting business in the form of pawn tickets. Violators will be investigated and prosecuted according to law. This announcement is hereby issued to inform everyone." After receiving the order, most shops that redeem pledged items for their customers have already closed in compliance with the order.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Lawyer Wu Huatai Suggests Improving Firefighting Equipment <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, Huatai believes that recent incidents of deaths caused by fires, which has occurred repeatedly, shows that there seems to be a lack of firefighting equipment in Shanghai. He recalls that in February 1934, he had suggested that all fire brigades should be equipped with safety nets, and sent a letter to a pictorial magazine, which was published in their pages. Given the special environment in Shanghai, where there are fewer houses and more people, and one house is often shared by four or five or even seven or eight families, the danger when there is a fire is unimaginable. In recent cases, such as the fire on North Shanxi Road on the 21st of last month, the fire on Hankou Road on the 23rd, and the fire on Ningxing Street on the 30th, there were incidents of burns and deaths. Huatai was deeply saddened after reading about these cases, so he raises this issue again, reiterating his previous request. He sent a letter to the fire brigades of both the British and French concessions with the following words: "When it comes to the maintenance of safety and perfect equipment in Shanghai, the fire brigade is unparalleled. They arrive immediately after receiving the report and extinguish the fire in an instant. Their services are so good that they are on par with those of countries in the East and West. However, in recent years, new buildings in Shanghai have been trending towards increasing height. For example, residential buildings have four or five floors, and there are also many skyscrapers with more than ten floors, which adds more difficulties to firefighting. If a fire occurs on the lower floors, it is often difficult for those on the top floor to escape. Although there is equipment such as rescue ladders, in places with large crowds and in times of panic, everyone wants to be the first to escape, and may not be able to maintain order and climb the ladder in order. In the case of skyscrapers with more than ten floors, long ladders may not be able to reach them. In February 1934, Huatai suggested that your association and others should be equipped with safety nets (the nets are made of extremely strong ropes, tied into a grid of five or six feet in length and width, with very sparse holes), so that when the ladder cannot reach high floors, this net can be used, with the four corners pulled open, so that those who cannot escape can jump down from a high place and ensure their safety. It was later heard that the fire brigades had adopted this measure, but after researching the pros and cons, they felt that it was not perfect. The rope used to construct the net, over time, may be subject to weakness, which can cause ruptures if there is excessive weight on the rope. Because of this, the material was changed to tarpaulin, also known as jumping cloth. Now, these are widely equipped, and one’s own private feelings express great appreciation. Now, these deaths caused by fires should be able to be avoided. However, news stories in the past few days has revealed that, in fact, in the last week alone, deaths have occurred in these three recent fires due to falling from heights: North Shanxi Road, Hankou Road, and Ningxing Street. Truly, this is unbearable. We are a major port of trade. The people are crowded and commerce is flourishing. This rescue net, or this jumping cloth, are trivial and easy to equip. The cost is minimal, but the benefits are truly great. I have once again sent a letter to express these unsolicited thoughts, and still hope that they will be adopted. If there is this type of equipment already, I hope that it will be put to extensive use. Several million citizens will be grateful." I believe that your publication is a mouthpiece for the citizens and will definitely support this, and will make a sympathetic advocacy to promote its realization. If any of this is warranted, I still wish to be educated. I send this to the Shen Bao newspaper's Zhongbi, Writer, Attorney Wu Huatai on May 4th with respect.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor, yesterday afternoon, a man around 40 years old, speaking with a Northern accent and calling himself Chen Junda, came to my residence. Under the pretext of a visit, he asked for one of my business cards (the card has the Shen Bao magazine's Ji Zhizhong's name and phone number printed on it). At the time, only my child was at home. Because the visitor was able to say my name and occupation, I did not suspect anything and gave him a business card after asking him to leave a note. However, I did not know this person, and I do not know what the note he left means. Furthermore, he did not ask where I was, and actually barged into the second floor. I heard that similar events occurred at Mr. Cai's residence and Ms. He's residence in the neighborhood at the same time. This behavior seems to be fraudulent beyond a doubt. I will not be responsible for any loans borrowed, items fraudulently taken, or anything else done using the stolen business cards. I humbly request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to prevent others from being deceived. With best regards, Ji Zhizhong on May 4th.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, I am writing to you about the news about this city that was published on the 4th, which had a news story about the manager of the Tiancheng Money Exchange being kidnapped at home yesterday. Near the end, you wrote "It has been heard that the owner of this shop was Mr. Lu Gengsheng, who was shot in the last month and who has died.". This is quite a surprise. According to the late brother Lu Gengsheng, he had monetary exchanges with the Tiancheng Money Exchange on a day-to-day basis and was not a stakeholder for the shop. We were afraid that there would be outside misunderstandings, and therefore are respectfully writing this letter to request that this newspaper correct this matter. We are grateful for this. We are sending this to the Shanghai press news department for inspection with respect. Lu Gengdi, May 4th.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially tightened, then retreated during the day, ultimately closing flat. The market experienced significant stimulation, and the turmoil has yet to subside. Looking at the morning's trading, the movements were truly astonishing, driven by frenzied speculation and a large number of "扒戶" (scalpers), leading to high demand and a sharp price contraction. British gold broke all previous records, falling to only 3.0625 taels. Later, speculators took profits, and there were more sellers than buyers in the market, resulting in a particularly firm market sentiment. The loosest price for British gold was 3.15625 taels, and US dollars could be settled at 4.625 yuan. However, the final results were similar to yesterday's close, with British gold at 3.125 taels and US dollars at 4.5 yuan. Futures prices also showed little difference. Because new price levels have not yet been established, people remain uncertain, and the market feels erratic.</p>
<p>Closing Market Offers No Clear Gains or Losses</p>
<p>In the morning, London's telegraph indicated that large amounts of currency had fallen by 4.375, and distant futures had dropped by 3.75.

<p>Yesterday's market situation for currencies of various countries saw British and American gold pounds initially continue their wild fluctuations. Due to the continuous rise and subsequent fall of cash, those who profited made some sales, causing market prices to decline immediately. As a result, compared to the previous day, they each rose by one yuan. Demand for British gold notes did not decrease, and market prices continued to rise. US dollar notes initially traded at 21.78 yuan, and then rose to 23.5 yuan, an unprecedented high price. However, after the high price, it caused a general profit-taking sell-off, and the final price was 21.5 yuan, with no difference compared to yesterday. Hong Kong notes continued to closely follow the sharp rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Demand for French franc notes remained strong, and market prices remained firm.

<p>Yesterday's spot cash market situation initially rose and then fell, with fluctuations closely following the foreign exchange market. However, a strong investor sentiment was also a major factor. In the early morning, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was entering an extremely tight state, and buying immediately surged. The opening price was 7,200 yuan, fluctuating by 300 yuan. A certain bank, acting on behalf of a foreign firm in the money exchange industry, was the most active in searching for purchases. However, soon after, the "證券帮" (securities gang) of Yu Hao poured out supply, sharply pressing the price down to 6,750 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange industry re-engaged in absorption, returning above the 7,000 yuan mark, reaching 7,100 yuan. However, due to the Saturday effect, retail investors crowded to close out positions, falling again to 6,850 yuan. Ultimately, the money exchange industry maintained its efforts and closed at 6,910 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, sentiment outside the market was still good, with many buyers at the noon closing price, but there was a lack of suppliers, resulting in no trading. The volume traded was approximately 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices initially rose and then fell, ultimately down slightly by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Again Rises By Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially reported a decline in the exchange rate, and the US dollar became tight, but investor sentiment remained strong. A certain money exchange firm was eager for demand and called out for purchases first, causing the opening price to jump by 300 yuan, with Jin Hao and others buying dozens of taels at a price of 7,200 yuan. At the same time, trades also opened at 7,200 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain gold firm, due to some negative rumors in the market, urgently sold off, and the quantity was quite large. In addition, the securities gang followed up with a sharp influx, and the exchange rate relaxed, significantly reducing the number of buyers, and the price immediately plummeted by 450 yuan. Jin Hao sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm, retreating to 6,750 yuan. However, at that time, the buying intentions of the money exchange firm resurfaced, and another securities gang followed up, while the selling positions of the gold firms gradually decreased, and the price soared again by 350 yuan, returning above the 7,000 yuan mark. The money exchange firm bought 30 taels from Jin Hao at a price of 7,100 yuan. Shortly after, the exchange rate became flat, and a certain money exchange firm had stopped purchasing. The silver firm gang took advantage of the high price to sell forcefully, and scattered investors and gold firms also sold off one after another, returning again to the 7,000 yuan mark. Jin Hao sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm at a price of 6,850 yuan. Near the close, the money exchange firm slightly pulled in, raising the price by 60 yuan. The money exchange firm traded 20 taels at 6,910 yuan, setting the noon closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the cash price rose by ten yuan. The fluctuations were 450 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than that of cash, and the purchasing price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few trades.</p>

<p>The initial exchange rate for silver jewelry was 710 yuan for Datongxing, and then at 9:30 AM, it was raised by 20 yuan, and returned to 20 yuan lower not ten minutes later. At 9:55 AM, it continued to be lowered by 10 yuan, and at 10:00 AM, it returned to 10 yuan higher. At noon, it was again 10 yuan lower. There were also changes after this, and the result was 10 yuan lower. It is estimated that Datongxing changed to 700 yuan, and the new firm had the same price as above.

<p>Yesterday's market for securities in the unofficial market was weak again. Because there were fewer transactions, there were not many waves. The market was firm initially due to covering short positions, and then fell due to retail investors closing long positions. Rumors continued to strike the market, indicating the emptiness of investor sentiment. As a result, there were many bank withdrawals, causing unnecessary commotion. Yesterday, Qiwu, Tongsheng, Lianhe, and Xinfu bought in, all to cover short positions. Yuankang, Lianyi, Shengyi, Daren, and Chang were partly selling long positions and partly the continued outflow of spot goods. Therefore, market prices tended to weaken. In the afternoon, Yitai and Shengyi, as well as retail investors, covered short positions, and Shunkang and Yongfeng sold, and market prices slightly rebounded. On the surface, it was still a hovering situation, but future changes are bound to be astonishing and must be guarded against. Yesterday's market price was slightly lower, ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 yuan. The turnover was approximately 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>

<p>A few days ago, a small quantity of large slices of sun-dried longan was offered by a certain company, but because the quality was relatively soft, the price fell by 6 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the rice market was very volatile and unpredictable. Continuing the momentum from the previous day, sentiment was strong and rising, and it turned into a situation where there was no movement, but once there was movement, the shouting was frenzied. In an instant, trading was booming, and the prices of various types of rice flew up by more than two yuan, especially 小絞 (small-grained rice), which was the most active. It even broke the high point during the Lunar New Year and opened at 50 yuan. Later, when it was heard that the gold price had broken through the 7,000 yuan mark, the general floating and retail investors became even more excited, stirred up trouble, and regardless of the quality of the goods, they were only afraid of not getting their hands on it, and pulled it in recklessly, using their old tricks of manipulation, creating an unprecedented "塔尖" (peak). For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at 54 yuan, and small-grained rice at 52 yuan, a huge increase of three to four yuan compared to the closing price the previous afternoon. Fortunately, the market hovered after that and did not continue to rise. And because the gold price fell back, sentiment was quite frustrated, and those who profited sold back one after another, and the high price was difficult to maintain, and the price went down step by step. No. 1 Saigon fell to 52.5 yuan, and small-grained rice fell to 49.5 yuan. Until the close of the market, it could not rise again. As a result, it increased by half a yuan compared to the closing price yesterday, and compared to the peak price the previous morning, it was only half a yuan better. The whole market was tight and then weak, rising and falling one after another, reaching three yuan. It can be seen that the changes in the rice market are drastic. It was found that this wave of price increases only lasted for a few days, and suddenly rose by ten yuan. The power of one price increase was even greater than slaughter.</p>
<p>When domestic rice prices were high, foreign rice was also in the midst of a violent storm. However, because it was not affected by the exchange rate, its momentum was not as strong as that of foreign rice. It was only mutually influential and raised together. It is rumored that in the off-market trade, the price of thick and thin粳 (Japonica) of the first grade, although the destination was quite chestnut-like, the selling price only fluctuated by more than one yuan. Special 淸粳 (clear Japonica) from Wuxi was 51-52 yuan,粉粳 (powdery Japonica) was 50 yuan, 常崑粳 (Chang Kun Japonica) was 51 yuan, and second-grade宿熱 (stale and hot) was 48-49 yuan.特薄 (Extra thin)稻 (paddy) from Qingsi was around 51 yuan,大市 (the general market) was 50 yuan, 49 yuan.南港 (Nangang) early and late稻 (paddy) was high-priced at 49 yuan, and second-grade was 47-48 yuan. Although glutinous rice prices are cheap, the destination is too small, so it is not as tight as other goods, so the price is not easy to raise sharply, only increasing by half a yuan. 开 (Kai)特 (Te) from Liyang and Jintan was 44.5 yuan, 44 yuan,大市 (the general market) was 42-42 yuan, and 常 (Chang)货 (goods) from Dan were 高 (Gao) since 42-43 yuan, and the second-grade 潮軟 (damp and soft) ones were still only around 40 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that 1,700-1,800 bags of粳 (Japonica) and glutinous rice were shipped out of the inland river barges and the Hongkou district.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is in speculation and in the heat, and the market has lost its normal state. There are very few actual sales. The market is completely a football business. As soon as they hear that the gold exchange rate continues to contract, they all rush to buy in. If there is news of a gold drop, then they compete to sell off. In the early market, continuing the price increase from the previous day, buying was extremely strong. The price of Chenxi 1 was 54 yuan. Small-grained rice was up to 52 yuan. Other rices were raised consistently, and rose two yuan higher than the closing price the night before. Compared to the morning closing price, there was a difference of three or four yuan. However, hearing the rumors that the exchange rate was returning to growth, the market price immediately fell by one or two yuan as they competed to sell off. The afternoon slightly rebounded, and the result was not much different from the previous day's closing price. Only the five-month No. 2 Saigon which was going to be brought back rose. The opening price in the early market was as high as 61 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the night before. Subsequently, the price was lowered gradually as floating investors cut their long positions, and the lowest price in the afternoon was 58.7 yuan, and the closing price rebounded slightly to 59.1 yuan, still down 0.4 to 0.5 yuan compared to the night before. Both buying and selling were active. The futures volume was 600-700 tons, and the spot rice was nearly 10,000 bags, still mainly floating investors.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Flour Continues to Increase By Two Fen; The Rising Trend of Inland Flour is Even Stronger <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw factory prices continue to increase by two fen, changing to 14 yuan in cash. Because the gold market soared again and rice prices rose, the cost of each factory had to be above 15 yuan. For the wholesale price on this street, the nature of maintenance is still maintained. Old car brand flour from backflowed goods was locked up by hoarding households and had to be sold at 14.45 yuan, but there were no significant transactions. Inland flour has recently been happily taken by this street, and the rising trend is even stronger. For example, the Double Lion brand reached 14.3 yuan, and the Shan Lu brand reached 14.25 yuan. There were 4,000-5,000 bags traded, all handled by this street. The amount of zero-batch purchased from the factory by this street was approximately 7,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Actual Sales Still Lacking <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The situation in the oil market still cannot escape the environmental constraints, causing investor sentiment to remain high. Trading in the market is unusually lively, but actual sales only account for a quarter, and the pace of price increases is still narrow. As a result, soybean oil has few differences, but peanut oil is slightly tighter by one or two yuan. Today, 650 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The price of soybeans rose by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan yesterday, but its foundation is not solid. It seems that if the external storm on Monday is not large, investor sentiment will inevitably waver, and it is feared that the overall situation will be difficult to maintain. Today, 1,630 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Sugar Market: The Rising Trend of Sugar Prices is Still Strong <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, because the foreign exchange rate continued to be tight, the association's benchmark price rose again. The spot price of Er Si coarse white from Waizhan (Foreign Warehouse) with arrival on March 18 was 76 yuan, and the price with arrival on April 28 was 76.5 yuan, an increase of about 3 yuan. The price of Taigu Che Bai B Mark was 86 yuan, an increase of 1-2 yuan. H Che Chi (H Car Red) was 61.5 to 63 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. The price of domestic sugar Guoxiang Chi was 58 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. The price of Hainan Chi was 55 to 56 yuan, a sharp increase of more than 10 yuan. The price of Diaoqing 4 was 65 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Cotton Yarn: Although Actual Sales are Stagnant, Yarn Prices Still Rise; Speculation Focuses on Double Horse as a Tool; Higher Than Similar Yarns by 200 Yuan <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains extremely chaotic. General speculators are using the opportunities of the foreign exchange rate, expanding and contracting from time to time, still tending to drag in. However, as it continues to rise, actual sales are largely stagnant. Therefore, the target of twenty-count Double Horse is used as a tool, and the rising power is particularly strong. As a result, the price of twenty-count cotton yarn of the same type is 120 to 200 yuan lower than Double Horse. It is conceivable that consumers are weak.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn was due to the contraction of the US dollar in the afternoon of the previous day, the popularity was enthusiastic, and the shouts were chaotic like hemp. The situation was tight and loose. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse jumped 100 yuan, to 1,760 yuan. The price of May futures was 1,800 yuan, trading at 1,815 yuan. As soon as the US dollar opened, and then turned stable, the enthusiasm suddenly slackened, and the spot price fell to 1,708 yuan. After the close, it went back up ten yuan. It was found that the trading statistics for half a day were 1,520 packages. Today, 205 pieces of yarn are shipped to Yagang. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Trading firms 500 Hong Kong 420</p>
<p>Inland 200</p>
<p>Statistics 1,520</p>
<h3 id="e93">Tight Credit; The Cotton Market Stagnates <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>This cotton transaction is exceptionally 清澹 (light and delicate), but the momentum is still firm. As for the factory side, there is very little vitality, and not a single package is handled. The buying and selling between counterparts is also not as lively as it used to be. In fact, it is due to the tight credit. The following is a record of the current cotton transactions:</p>
<p>Huocao Package 32.00 Traded between counterparts 500 packages</p>
<p>Olmra 295.00 Traded between counterparts 100 pieces</p>
<p>Xinte 13.00 Traded between counterparts 100 pieces</p>
<p>Pingguoer 35.00 Traded between counterparts 200 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, the market situation is quite quiet, and the later father, due to the short-selling in the south and the selling by overseas merchants, the closing price fell five or six pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton market, due to the impact of the sharp contraction in the Shanghai exchange rate, all parties are watching. Yesterday, including the forecast, increased by one Robi, Egypt increased by eight or nine pounds.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quieter recently, but all parties continue to see high cotton prices. However, because credit is extremely tight, transactions are scarce. However, according to reliable sources, the Japanese have little cotton in stock and will purchase spot goods within days.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Piece Goods: The Higher the Cloth Price, the More Stagnant the Destination; Longtou Fine Cloth Single, Higher Than Spot by Five Yuan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Cloth prices continue to see increase, because hoarding households inside and outside the industry are still rich with buying appetite, the factory price has been raised, so searching for hand goods is quite enthusiastic, but actual sales run counter to this, and are increasingly declining. The market is extremely chaotic. For cloth of the same quality, the price difference is as high as five or six yuan per piece due to the relationship between the brand's maturity. This is because mature brands meet the needs of speculators. Even more, the Longtou fine cloth factory's warehouse list goods must be more expensive than each spot goods by four or five yuan, which is really a strange phenomenon. The turnover for the whole day was more than 800 pieces bought and sold by the trade association. White goods sold out rose 0.25 to 1 yuan, colored cloth rose 1 to 2 yuan, and bleached cloth and other light-colored goods were scarce. Today, 130 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth rose in the morning and fell at noon, and fine cloth fell 0.8 to 0.9 yuan per piece. When the market opened in the morning, the market was particularly strong. The highest price for the Longtou spot single once reached around 46 yuan. Before long, it fell to the noon closing price of 44.5 yuan. In the afternoon, because there were many rumors and news of restrictions on withdrawals in the financial industry, investor sentiment was fearful, and credit became tight, and the market transaction turned to clear. Fine cloth once reached 43.5 yuan. By the time of the closing, it had risen again. The Longtou fine cloth was 44 yuan. This month's cloth was 46.5 yuan. The current price of Four Gentlemen twill is 2.56 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Wanli Is Selling Well <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The market for Wanli wool crepe was tight yesterday, and the selling price was high both officially and unofficially. Last year, Western-style clothing was popular, and sales are even more popular this summer. The outlet for Yuanchang, Huanghui, and white is active. It has been found that most of the goods arriving at the foreign firm have been sold out. According to a recent investigation report, the number of Wanli wool crepe of Xihuo Changtai, Meichen, Zhaoji, Xiankang, Haoshi, and Japanese goods transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai is less than fifty pieces in the entire city, which makes investor sentiment firm and the market price is generally expected to rise again. On the day the foreign exchange rate changed drastically, there was an additional two yuan to make more profits. Yesterday, Western wool Wanli wool crepe was sold for 23.5 yuan per yard in general, the price for Eastern goods was 19.5 yuan, and the secondary brand was 16 yuan. A few cents must be added to the selling price of pure white. Door shops increase the price for zero cuts by more than one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Silk and Tea: Tin Sericulture Costs Are Not Low <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi is a sericulture area. Last year, the silkworms sold at an unprecedented high price, and interest in sericulture was quite high. Now that the silkworm season has arrived, the total silkworm breeding volume is 30% more than last year. A total of 280,000 to 300,000 silkworm machines were issued from various fields. Silkworm bodies have been developing rapidly in recent days. The earliest hatched silkworms are already five days old, and the latest hatched silkworms are one or two days old. However, the estimated quantity of leaves is expected to be in short supply in the future, so prices are gradually rising. The current price is 10 to 12 yuan per load. According to sericulture people, at the current silk price, each load costs about 4,000 yuan. Silkworm farmers consume about four loads of mulberry leaves to raise one silkworm egg. The cocoon yield of each silkworm egg is about 30 catties. If the leaf price is 10 yuan per load, the cost of mulberry leaves is already 40 yuan. If fresh cocoons are sold at 200 yuan per load, then the cocoon production of each silkworm egg can earn 60 yuan. Subtracting the 40 yuan leaf price, plus the consumption of labor, silkworm eggs, and other items, there is still a small profit. If the cocoon price is less than 200 yuan, and the leaf price is higher than 10 yuan, if the silkworms die in the middle of the process, the silkworm farmers will lose money. (良)</p>

<p>The metal market, affected by the sharp drop in exchange rates over the past three days, has become stagnant. Price quotations for various goods are also chaotic. Actual transactions are exceptionally slow, and market sentiment remains fearful. Fluctuations of several hundred yuan in a single day are common. For example, black iron billets were still quoted at 1,200 yuan in a quiet market, but yesterday's market price ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, without a clear standard. 200-pound U.S. Steel Company iron, which was sold for 190 yuan the day before, was quoted at 220 yuan yesterday. Tinplate has long exceeded 300 yuan, and new galvanized wire has reached the 150 yuan mark. Hunan pure antimony has reappeared at 6,000 yuan. U.S. narrow strip iron is also sold at 160 yuan, and zinc iron requires 200 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shanghai City Student Federation Established: Over 300 Representatives from Universities and Middle Schools Attended <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>(Daguang News Agency) The Shanghai City Student Federation held its inaugural meeting yesterday. Participants included 27 universities and 63 middle schools, with a total of over 300 representatives. Representatives from relevant authorities and various sectors also attended to provide guidance. On the same day, the articles of association and declaration of establishment were approved, along with several important resolutions. Three telegrams were also sent: one to pay respects to President Chiang, one to express condolences to the soldiers at the front, and one to denounce the puppet organization. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic. It is expected that the federation will achieve much in its future work. Key points from the original telegrams are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Pay Respects to President Chiang: The general idea is that since the outbreak of the war of resistance, it has been three years. Under your leadership, the military and civilians across the country are united in spirit. Unexpectedly, at this time when the war has reached a stalemate and victory is in sight, a puppet government has been established. The young students of this city, living on an isolated island, have their hearts set on the motherland and vow to deal with the Japanese and puppets to the end with the greatest determination. We will never forget this unwavering resolve. As you hold the central authority and work for the country, we look up to your virtuous achievements with admiration and send our best wishes for the completion of your great mission and for your health and well-being.</p>
<p>Telegram of Condolences to the Soldiers at the Front: Roughly says, the Military Affairs Commission forwards to the meritorious soldiers at the front in various regions. Border alarm signals sound, and the vast land of China is painfully ravaged. Fortunately, our leader's command is resolute, and the soldiers at the front are vying to serve. Missiles fly like lightning, blood fills the trenches, they rise again after being stabbed, and enemies are annihilated like hair. Now the Japanese are trapped and deeply mired. The final victory is certain. It is hoped that they will continue to strive with sincerity to achieve complete success. The federation leads all students and vows to be a rear support, to eliminate the great enemy, and to restore our homeland. This telegram is sent to express our condolences, and we respectfully hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>Telegram to Denounce the Puppet Organization: The general idea is that this telegram is addressed to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, the presidents of the various branches of the National Political Council, the directors of the various campaign headquarters, the ministers of the various ministries and commissions, the commanders-in-chief of the various war zones, the party headquarters and provincial governments of the various provinces, various legal entities, newspaper offices, and all compatriots across the country. The young students of this city firmly believe that without destroying power, there is no justice, and without eliminating violence, there is no peace. Therefore, we have organized a student federation and vow to lead all students in the city to gather under the leadership of the President, strictly adhere to our posts, and uphold national policies. The day the Japanese puppets collapse will be the day our homeland is restored. We respectfully send this telegram to denounce them and sincerely hope for your consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e99">This Year's Middle School Graduation Examinations <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Held in Fifteen Provinces Including Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc.; Temporarily Postponed in Seven Provinces Including Jin, Sui, Lu, Hubei, Su, etc.</p>
<p>(Chongqing, 4th) The Ministry of Education has drafted and telegraphed to educational administrative agencies in various provinces and cities the measures for the 28th academic year (i.e., this year's summer) middle school student graduation examinations, to be held during the last week of June. These measures are largely the same as those stipulated for the 27th academic year. However, the number of provinces scheduled to hold examinations last year was eight, while this year it has increased to fifteen. The eight measures are as follows: (1) Middle school student graduation examinations will continue to be held in fifteen provinces including Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. In provinces with larger areas and transportation difficulties, the junior high school examinations may be conducted on a sampling basis. Senior high school examinations may be held in multiple locations, depending on the actual situation, to facilitate concentration. (2) Middle school graduation examinations in provinces such as Jin, Sui, Lu, Hubei, Guangdong, Su, and Anhui will not be held temporarily this year. However, the graduation examinations of schools currently in session shall be supervised by personnel dispatched by the provincial education departments. Procedures such as question setting, supervision, and sealing shall be strictly handled by the supervisory personnel in conjunction with the principals and teachers, in accordance with the various examination regulations. (3) Graduating students from national middle schools or schools that have relocated to various places due to the war should either participate in the graduation examinations of local schools of the same level or have their graduation examinations supervised by personnel dispatched by the local competent educational administrative authorities. (4) The subjects for this year's middle school student graduation examinations are stipulated as follows: Chinese language, foreign language, mathematics, science (physics and chemistry), and history and geography. However, junior high schools may, at the discretion of each province, exempt foreign languages. (5) The ranking of student graduates shall be provisionally determined by arranging the names of the students according to the overall average of their graduation scores in each subject. The method for calculating this overall average is the sum of the scores in the examination subjects and the scores in the non-examination subjects, divided by the sum of the number of examination subjects and non-examination subjects. (6) This year, only the list of schools participating in the examination needs to be published; there is no need to calculate school scores based on student performance. (7) Students with failing conduct or physical education scores shall not graduate. Each school should strictly assess the conduct and physical education scores of graduating students and should not allow them to participate in the examination simply because their academic performance is passing, regardless of whether their conduct and physical education scores are passing. (8) In provinces holding examinations, 10% of the total number of students who pass the senior and junior high school examinations with better scores will be allowed to be admitted to higher education without further examination. However, junior high school graduates who are exempted from English in the graduation examination should still be tested in English upon entering higher education.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Message to All Students in Shanghai from the University and Middle School Student Federation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The University and Middle School Student Federation of this city issued a message to all students in Shanghai to commemorate the "May Fourth" Festival. It stated, "Time flies, and today is another Youth Day. On such a generous, passionate, tragic, and enthusiastic great festival that marks an era in Chinese history, no youth in the country, especially no Shanghai youth student who has been fighting and growing up in this extremely difficult and dangerous environment, does not recall the May Fourth Movement 21 years ago, when the students of Peking appeared with the distinct banner of overthrowing the traitors. Moreover, no one does not hate and despise the fact that, from the May Fourth Movement until now, our</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the country has continued to produce these traitors who sell out the country and the people and lose many sovereign rights and interests. However, we are determined to eradicate these traitors and recover everything that has been lost.</p>
<p>We certainly understand very well that the May Fourth Movement is the overall representative of the Chinese youth students leading the people to formally resist imperialism and attack feudal forces. Later, in order to commemorate the great significance of this student movement in Chinese history, it was renamed Youth Day. On the one hand, it can recall the countless youths who created this glorious and great achievement with blood and tears in this struggle. On the other hand, it also expresses encouragement for the future, hoping that the latter will continue the spirit of their predecessors and move forward. (To be continued)"</p>

<h3 id="e101">Miniature Football Matches Yesterday: Jingxiang Lost to Xifusi; Youyou Won Against Zhenyou with a Late Comeback; French Business Association Suffered a Crushing Defeat to the French Army <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Six matches were played yesterday in the Zhen Dan miniature football league, with many unexpected results and miracles in the three A group matches. The atmosphere on the field was exceptionally intense. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>A Group 1: French Army defeated French Business Association 3-2</p>
<p>A Group 1: Xifusi defeated Jingxiang 3-2</p>
<p>A Group 2: Youyou Association defeated Zhenyou 5-2</p>
<p>B Group 1: Iron Riders tied French Army 3-3</p>
<p>B Group 2: Zhen Dan A defeated Lion Voice 6-2</p>
<p>B Group 4: Jewish Association defeated Datong 8-0</p>
<p>Among them, the French Army's victory over the French Business Association was a major upset, while Xifusi's victory over Jingxiang with fewer players in the last half minute was purely lucky. Youyou, from a 0-3 deficit, scored five consecutive goals to turn the tables.</p>
<p>Youyou Turns Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>In the main match, Youyou and Zhenyou took the field. Zhenyou gathered all its famous players in hopes of a desperate fight. As the battle began, after three minutes, Carlo Liequ lightly passed, and Mao Honggui let the ball in from under his legs, and Youyou lost the first goal. At 21 minutes, Robert Stoff hit the target, but the goal was disallowed for offside. Carlo Liequ rushed up and hit the goalpost, and Zhenyou scored another goal. After three minutes, Robert Stoff quickly rushed in, and Mao Honggui missed again, and Zhenyou scored three goals in a row. Not until 30 minutes, Wu Binghao poked the empty goal to recover one goal, and lagged behind with a score of 1-3 in the first half. In the second half, Youyou adjusted its front line. At 12 minutes, Cao Qinfang's shot near the goal established a meritorious service (2-3). At 20 minutes, Zhenyou's defender Yu Zhendong fouled, and Cao Qinfang took the penalty kick and made the score 3-3. At 23 minutes, Qinfang's wonderful shot from 20 yards hit the crossbar and fell into the net, and Youyou exceeded with 4-1. Shortly after half a minute, Qinfang hooked from the baseline, and Youyou turned defeat into victory and defeated Zhenyou by a score of 5-3.</p>

<p>Xifusi Frustrates Jingxiang</p>
<p>Xifusi has enough strength after all. Initially, it did not get the tricks of miniature football, and the kicks did not look satisfactory. Recently, it has gradually improved, and showed its brilliance yesterday. The battle situation was tense from beginning to end. Xifusi Tangxun opened the record first, and Zhou Benfang immediately recovered the lost ground. After each side scored one goal, Jiemo hit the corner of the net with great difficulty. Xifusi took the lead with 2-1 in the first half. Not long after changing sides, Yingbing's main player Deng Qing suffered a serious injury and retired. There was no one to substitute, and only six people played. After nearly 20 minutes of stalemate, Li William let go with a long shot, and the score was tied. At this point, the situation became more and more tense. When there was less than half a minute left in the game, the striker of the agent team, Sai Kousigan, succeeded with one kick. The ball went into the net and the whistle sounded. Jingxiang was finally defeated by 3-2.</p>

<p>A Decisive Victory of Three Straight Sets Worthy of a Renowned Player, Tonight's Fourth Match</p>
<p>The third round robin match of the third Jingwu Cup Shanghai Individual Ping Pong Championship was held at the Jingwu Association's ball room the night before last at 7 PM. Unexpected results occurred continuously, greatly exciting the fans. In particular, the match between the rising star Chuan Gongfang and Lu Hanjun was the focus of the audience. After the two faced off, Chuan relied on his cunning style of looping shots and relentless attacks. Lu was also skilled in chopping, but in view of Zhang Ying's disastrous defeat with chopping yesterday, he changed his tactics and also returned with looping shots. Combined with his agile physique and extremely fast strokes, and the excellent landing point of his shots, Xiao Zhuan was unable to defend and was ineffective in counter-looping, being at a disadvantage all the way. As a result, Lu relied on his intelligence and experience to defeat his strong opponent in three straight sets, demonstrating the true qualities of the previous champion. Tonight (the 5th) at 7 PM, the fourth match will be held at the same location. Referees: Sui Shen, Chen Linsheng. To limit the number of spectators, tickets are priced at two jiao per person. The results of the night before last and tonight's schedule are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Night Before Last's Results: Lu Hanjun defeated Chuan Qifang 3-0, Deng Xiurong defeated Pan Rixi 3-1, Zhang Ying defeated Guo Jingren 3-1, Li Zongpei defeated Huang Zhijun 3-1.</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule: (1) Ouyang Wei - Huang Zhijun, (2) Chuan Qifang - Deng Xiurong, (3) Li Zongpei - Guo Jingren, (4) Lu Hanjun - Pan Rixi.</p>

<p>Kobe, a major metropolis in Japan, lies south of the vast sea. The locals build houses along the mountains. Gazing into the distance where the wild geese disappear into the sky, their houses are dimly visible. The mountain scenery is like a screen, this is the Kii Province of Japan. The flow of goods here relies entirely on Osaka. Although business is not as prosperous as Yokohama, the sails of ships come and go endlessly, making it a hub for trade in the East. The area is only a few miles in size, with a population of only tens of thousands. To the left is the Kusunoki Masashige Shrine. The temple is spacious and clean. In front of the temple is a wooden box. Worshippers toss a few coins into the box as an offering, bow before the deity, close their eyes, and clap their hands. It is said that the Japanese do not kneel and worship. A few steps to the west is the Hyogo area, similar in size to Kobe. The two places are connected by a stream several feet wide. High embankments are built on both sides of the stream, with ancient pine trees planted everywhere, providing a green canopy. Arriving here in the afternoon gives a sense of the ancient road at sunset. Not far east of the Kusunoki Shrine is the central train station, from which one can travel to Osaka and Kyoto. To the left of Kobe are two temples, one is the Suwa Mountain Fox Shrine, with tea houses, taverns, and hot spring baths located above and below the temple. From here, one can climb to the top and look far into the distance, with the landscape entering the painting, stretching endlessly. The other is the Ikuta Shrine. A few steps to the east leads to the main road to the Nunobiki Falls. The Nunobiki Mountain has two waterfalls, one is the "Male Waterfall," which is 24 zhang high, and the other is the "Female Waterfall," which is 18 zhang high.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Japan-China War Mired in Chinese Soil <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>Having Lost the Initiative, the Attacking Force Weakens Over Time</p>
<p>The Success of China's War of Attrition</p>
<p>One year, two years; the Japan-China war, almost three years in the making, remains mired in Chinese soil and unresolved. This is beyond the expectations of the Chinese, but beyond the expectations of the Japanese. Finally, due to the revelation of the facts, the Japanese warlords also understand that this is a long-term war. Former Prime Minister Abe, in a broadcast speech on November 25 last year, publicly admitted, "The completion of the China Incident and the removal of its aftermath will take at least ten years." The pessimistic attitude held by Japanese military and political leaders, on his part, is sufficient to prove that the attrition strategy adopted by the Chinese people has achieved</p>
<p>The Success of China's War of Attrition</p>
<p>great results, making it impossible for the Japanese to extricate themselves. As someone pointed out, China has reached the second stage of the long-term war of resistance. In this stage, Japan's military strength will gradually be consumed and weakened, losing its advantage.</p>
<p>In the first stage of the war, the Japanese army, with its superior quality and sophisticated weapons, repeatedly tried to annihilate the main force of the Chinese army. However, in the first stage of China's national liberation war, the situation was very different from the past. After the Japanese army captured Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese had long declared that the future would be a political offensive, but Japan did not achieve this goal at all. The long-term war is still going on. With the arrival of the second phase of the war, Japan has lost its initiative in the military. China is able to smoothly carry out its purpose of destroying the morale of the Japanese frontline soldiers and increasing the anti-war sentiment of the Japanese domestic people. This in itself shows that China's long-term war of resistance strategy is successful.</p>
<p>Decline of the Japanese Offensive</p>
<p>Looking at the military actions in 1939, the strength of the Japanese offensive was far less than that, which is a proof of a trend of exhaustion of the Japanese offensive. None of the Japanese military actions in 1939 achieved her goal of eliminating the main force of the Chinese army. From another point of view, this is proof of the increased resistance of the Chinese army. Last year's large-scale Japanese military action was the attack on Nanchang, the purpose of which was to expand its power south of Hankou and reduce the threat of the Chinese army to its transportation lines (the Yangtze River waterway). In order to achieve this goal, the Japanese army advanced towards Nanchang, Yuezhou, and Changsha. If this plan were successful, this area could become a Japanese base, and the Japanese army could advance south along the Yuehan, and meet with the Japanese army in Guangdong, cutting off the connection between the coastal provinces of China, such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, and the inland. However, the Japanese army spent a lot of effort and only realized one goal, that is, the occupation of Nanchang. The Japanese army's advance towards Changsha was blocked by the Chinese army. In April, the Japanese army changed its target of advance again, wanting to advance from Hankou to the northwest, with Xinyang and Nanyang as its targets. At the same time, the Japanese army in Kaifeng also went south to respond. The Japanese decision to attack came unexpectedly, and suffered an unprecedented defeat since the Battle of Taierzhuang. They retreated two hundred kilometers and suffered tens of thousands of casualties. The large-scale offensive in northern Hubei came to an end.</p>
<p>In September last year, the Japanese army again attempted to invade northern Hunan to complete her plan to occupy Yuezhou and Changsha in mid-January. As a result, they were defeated outside Changsha, with 30,000 Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. Looking at the Japanese military actions last year, at least one impression is given, one is that they are in a hurry and have no definite goal, and the other is that large-scale military actions have been severely damaged by the Chinese army and cannot be advanced.</p>
<p>Japanese Objectives Have Become Confused</p>
<p>The biggest achievement of the Japanese army last year was the successful surprise attack on Qinzhou and the occupation of Nanning. Since the Japanese army could not defeat the Chinese army in the hinterland, they wanted to cut off China's international passage and use "economic strangulation" to complete her aggression, but the landing in Qinzhou and the occupation of Nanning did not achieve her expected goals. After the Japanese army occupied Nanning, they were trapped in a semi-circular encirclement by the Chinese army, entering and exiting several times, and still failed to move north to Liuzhou and west to Longzhou to cut off the international transportation line from Longzhou to Vietnam.</p>
<p>Starting in 1940, Japan wanted to invade Guangdong and Hunan from the Yuehan Line, so as to respond to the Japanese army in Guinan, but as a result of the large-scale invasion, the Chinese army in northern Guangdong explored a strong force, and the Japanese army was forced to retreat to the vicinity of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Exerting the Power of Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>In summary, none of the Japanese army's military actions in 1939 can be said to have achieved her expected goals. In the future, China must not only use regular troops to prevent the advance of the Japanese army, but also use guerrilla troops to disturb the rear of the Japanese army. This tactic has exerted great power in North China. The activities of guerrilla warfare in Shanxi have made no progress in the Japanese military in North China. The Japanese army has long shouted the slogan of eliminating guerrilla teams, but the Japanese army's eight general offensives in Shanxi Province last year have all failed, proving that the power of the guerrillas is not to be insulted. The recent great victory in western Sui is another proof of the success of mobile warfare.</p>
<p>Political Offensive Will Surely Fail</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of the situation of the Japanese invasion of China, due to the effectiveness of China's long-term war of resistance, due to the excessive length of the Japanese army's points and lines, and the defensive measures, due to the decline of the Japanese army's morale and the rise of domestic anti-war sentiment, Japan has no possibility of defeating the main force of China in the war. On the contrary, the longer the time, the weaker the power will be. This result makes the Japanese warlords anxious, and they are eager to solve the "Sino-Japanese Incident" as soon as possible. At present, the military offensive has been transformed into a political offensive. The establishment of pseudo-organizations is to use Chinese to control Chinese in order to achieve her goal of winning without fighting. Japan's attempt will obviously fail. China's determination to seek freedom and independence will become more firm due to the recent military trend of advantage, and it will never be deceived by Japan's tricks, and there will be no change in the basic policy of resisting to the end.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Masterminds of the Wang-Japan Secret Agreement: Abe's Special Envoy's Entourage, Kagesa and Inukai <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Wang regime in Nanjing this time, the Japanese government appointed Abe Nobuyuki as a special envoy, preparing to conduct peace negotiations, adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and build the so-called "New Order in East Asia" in order to realize her dream of destroying China. Abe has now come to China with a large entourage, many of whom are capable. Among them are two people, one is the military faction Kagesa Sadaki, and the other is the parliamentary faction Inukai Ken. Both are familiar with the Chinese situation, and they are the initiators of the Wang-Japan secret agreement, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Kagesa, a native of Hiroshima Prefecture, is a graduate of the 26th class of the Military Academy. He has worked in Nanjing, Shanghai and other places. Before the July 7th Incident, he was the "China Group Leader" of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. As the war developed, his position also rose accordingly. He not only directed the war, but also had close contact with all aspects of domestic affairs, diplomacy, and economy. In June of the following year, he was promoted to the head of the Military Affairs Section of the Japanese Army Ministry.</p>
<p>Japan mobilized its troops, wanting to conquer China in one breath by force, but it encountered China's strong resistance and fell into a quagmire, making it difficult to extricate itself. Therefore, it came up with a surprise plan, wanting to seek relief from the political aspect. Therefore, in November of the year before last, the Konoe statement appeared, and today, the Nanjing regime has been established. This policy of going hand in hand with politics and military affairs, who do you say is the mastermind behind the scenes, but it is Kagesa's proud work. Therefore, he must have many tricks to play this time when he comes with Abe.</p>
<p>Inukai Ken is a student in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Tokyo. His father, Inukai Ki, was the president of the Seiyukai after Tanaka. During the Hamaguchi Cabinet era, when the general election was held, Inukai was elected as a member of parliament in the second district of Tokyo as a man of letters. This was due to the support of the literary world and the origin of his family.</p>
<p>Inukai has been active in China since the summer of last year. During the current parliament's discussion on the regime's affairs, Inukai made a strong explanation to the cabinet members and members of the House of Peers and Representatives. He achieved extraordinary success, precisely because he was not a military man, he was even more trusted by the parliament, so after his speech, several members of parliament came forward to shake hands and express their admiration.</p>
<p>Inukai's relationship with China also occurred because of Inukai Ki. Ki was an old friend of President Sun, and he also participated in the funeral ceremony when President Sun passed away. At that time, Inukai Ken also accompanied him. He had met all the leaders of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>During his student days, he had many literary works, such as "The Success of the Duck", "An Era", and "A Night in Nanjing", which were all loved by people, especially the novel "Actress" left a deep impression on readers.</p>
<p>Kagesa and Inukai believe that they have a progressive understanding of China. Kagesa criticized domestic politicians, saying that their understanding of China inevitably has the shortcomings of being ununified and chaotic. He said that it is wrong to see China as a special country that is beyond the political laws of world history. It is even more wrong to see China as it was during the Sino-Japanese War. The occurrence of the Sino-Japanese Incident was due to Japan's misunderstanding of China. Now, if we want to overcome the difficulties of the incident, we must go through a long period of time, and both sides must reflect on each other and change their old views before there is hope.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Anesthetics: Japan's New Weapon <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou, translated from the original by Oarl Craw</p>
<p>Anesthetics—opium, morphine, and heroin—are the bayonets of Japan's military aggression against China.</p>
<p>Anesthetic Dealers as Vanguards</p>
<p>Using anesthetic dealers as vanguards to corrupt the people, especially the strong men of fighting age, they paved the way for military victory. The schemes of the special service agencies made the Chinese indulge in them, these Chinese may become dangerous leaders to the conquerors. Anesthetic vendors, in teams coming with the army, keep the people enslaved, while also profiting from it. The drug trade helps the finances of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Japan is knowingly committing crimes. Japanese laws punish drug addiction the most severely in the world and are strictly enforced. To give one example, just having a opium pipe can result in seven years of hard labor. Booklets are distributed to the soldiers, one section of which says: "The enjoyment of anesthetics is not worthy of a superior race like the Japanese. Only inferior races, those that are declining, such as the Chinese, Europeans, and East Indians, indulge in the enjoyment of anesthetics. That's why their fate is determined to be our slaves, and the result is extinction."</p>
<p>When they seized Manchuria, the Japanese first grasped the potential of anesthetics as a means of conquest. The opium-addicted Manchurian army fled or surrendered without resistance. Therefore, the Japanese army engaged in the use of anesthetics, preparing the procedures for conquering North China. The army The Japanese diplomats paved the way for the Korean vendors who were sent in. At home, Koreans do not have civil rights; the lowest Japanese can whip Korean nobles without being punished. But when the lowly people of Seoul came to China and began selling anesthetics, they became important representatives of the royal family. If arrested by the Chinese police, the Japanese police forced their release.</p>
<p>In this way, areas of China controlled by the Japanese were filled with anesthetics—sold openly like soap or kerosene. Every American expatriate in Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hankou was terrified by these disasters. The drug policy was most successful in Nanjing. Three years ago, Nanjing, like any American city, had no anesthetics. Under Chinese rule, it was impossible to buy anesthetics without a doctor's certificate. Even before rape and looting stopped, the Japanese had already begun publicly selling opium, morphine, and heroin.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Map of the Current Situation of the Sino-Japanese War <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>As U.S. Navy Major Fletcher said, "Disease and war have always been together, but it has been left to the Japanese to find a way to pay for the war from disease."</p>
<p>Recent Drug Trafficking Situation</p>
<p>According to a survey by British and American residents, at the beginning of 1939, there were 50,000 people in Nanjing—one-eighth of the total population—who were addicted to drugs. According to a recent report, the estimate is one-quarter to one-third of the total population. The Nanjing Opium Public Sale Office, which calls itself the Anti-Smoking Bureau, has a monthly turnover of 5 million yuan, which can be used to support 200,000 people.</p>
<p>There are 500 stores selling anesthetics in Beijing, more than any other industry. A quiet little street where I lived in Shanghai three years ago is now filled with opium dens and drug stores.</p>
<p>In the 1939 budget of "Manchukuo," the opium tax was 71 million yen, an increase of 24 million yen compared with 1938. A few months later, officials stated that the tax revenue could exceed 90 million yen. At one time, the opium tax ranked second in tax revenue, and if the current rate of increase continues unabated, it may reach first place. "Manchukuo" can very appropriately decorate its banknotes with poppy flowers.</p>
<p>The average annual opium production in Korea is usually one ton. It increased to five tons in 1931, seven tons in 1932, and fourteen tons in 1933. In 1937, due to the China Incident, there was a new need for the application of opium, which almost reached 30 tons.</p>
<p>From 1928 to 1934; the average number of Persian opium exports per year, including these two years, was about 500 tons. In 1935, the Japanese army was the main customer, and the export of Persian opium jumped to a new height of 833 tons. In 1936, it increased again to an alarming total of 1,346 tons. Some of the opium was loaded on ships flying the Japanese military transport flag and transported directly to the army. It can be seen that the war of anesthetics is too beneficial and important for the current victory of the army and the subsequent maintenance of the depraved nation's slavery to the conquerors.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Talking About National Goods with Overseas Chinese Merchants <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Sun</p>
<p>The Mentality of the Locals Should Also Be Noted</p>
<p>In addition to being sold in various parts of the country, our country's national goods are also sold in Southeast Asia in the largest quantity. Before the war, there were many national goods transported to Southeast Asia. Since the outbreak of the war, domestic transportation has been inconvenient, and overseas Chinese have been stimulated by the war, which has further increased their enthusiasm for using national goods. Therefore, in recent years, the goods manufactured by Shanghai national goods factories have been transported to Southeast Asia in large quantities, except for a part that is transported to the mainland. In addition, the exchange rate between the legal currency and Southeast Asian currencies and Hong Kong dollars has recently been too large, which is a good opportunity for national goods to be sold in Southeast Asia. Therefore, those who handle the export of national goods are paying attention to Southeast Asia, and overseas Chinese merchants who return to the country to investigate and purchase national goods are also coming and going. In order to understand the opinions of overseas Chinese merchants on national goods and the quality and types of national goods sold in Southeast Asia, the reporter specially visited a gentleman who had just come to Shanghai from Southeast Asia to purchase goods. He was kind enough to inform the following points:</p>
<p>In the current situation, the national goods that sell the most in Southeast Asia are fabrics, daily necessities, food, electrical appliances, condiments, glassware, enamel steel utensils, and silk. Before the war, because Japanese goods were dumped in Southeast Asia in large quantities, national goods in Southeast Asia could not be developed as much as possible due to various reasons. Since the Sino-Japanese and European wars have occurred one after another, on the one hand, the output of Japanese goods has gradually decreased, and European goods cannot be transported to Southeast Asia in large quantities due to the war, which is a very good opportunity for national goods to dominate Southeast Asia. However, there are several points that must be paid attention to when national goods are transported to Southeast Asia, that is, the consumers are not entirely overseas Chinese, but also include a large number of locals. Because the locals in Southeast Asia do not engage in production, the consumer goods they need every day are dependent on others and cannot be produced by themselves. As long as the goods can cater to their mentality and meet their needs, they do not care which country's goods they are. Because of this, the goods sold in Southeast Asia must be able to cater to the mentality and needs of overseas Chinese and locals. Secondly, the packaging of goods transported to Southeast Asia must be paid attention to, because poor packaging will cause the goods to be damaged, causing the distributors to suffer a great loss, and they will not be willing to purchase them again in the future. National goods in Southeast Asia are competing with European and American goods and Japanese goods. If they do not improve their quality and style at any time, it is difficult to gain a permanent foothold. Advertising should also be paid attention to. If national goods can do more advertising in various parts of Southeast Asia, their impressions will penetrate into the hearts of the people, arousing the belief of the people there, and the future development will be limitless. At present, there is a huge crisis in the promotion of national goods that needs to be solved urgently, that is, the issue of cash and futures. Foreign merchants in Southeast Asia sell a batch of goods and often have a 90-day payment method. The transaction of national goods in Southeast Asia is entirely cash for goods, and there is no fixed payment method.</p>

<p>— Bai Yu</p>
<p>Over the past week, due to unprecedented fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, prices of various commodities in Shanghai have risen in tandem. The prices of all essential goods have increased by 20% to 30%, causing anxiety and helplessness among salaried individuals with family responsibilities and housewives in charge of household affairs, who feel unable to cope with the cost of living. Currently, rice, coal, oil, salt, vegetables, clothes, shoes, socks, rent, and transportation are all expensive. While income cannot be increased, the rise in prices seems endless. It is already difficult to manage living expenses for one person, and the anxiety and helplessness of salaried individuals with family responsibilities and housewives in the face of the severe rise in prices is inevitable. The difficulty and distress of living is a serious current problem. Helplessness is not a solution. The tightening of foreign exchange and the rise in prices have their causes. The speculation of foreign exchange traders during the war and the hoarding and manipulation of goods by speculators are certainly factors. However, the massive import of foreign goods, the increase in import surplus, and the outflow of capital are also important reasons. According to the General Customs Administration's report on China's foreign trade in March of this year, the total value of imported foreign goods was 154,193,695 national currency, and the net value of exported domestic goods was 126,273,244 national currency, resulting in an import surplus of 27,920,451 national currency. Although Shanghai's import and export shows a surplus of 2,387,849 national currency in comparison (exports being 76,646,804 national currency, imports being 64,258,955 national currency), the national foreign trade as a whole has an import surplus of over 27 million, which is undoubtedly a major loophole in the wartime economy. We certainly cannot say that we should absolutely not use foreign goods during wartime, but the nation is at war, and the people should endure hardship to preserve some of the country's economic strength. We should not buy foreign goods unless absolutely necessary. According to the General Customs Administration's report, the total value of imported fruits, nuts, and vegetables alone in March was 2,252,339 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to over 6 million legal currency. Tobacco imports also reached over 1.9 million gold units, equivalent to over 5 million legal currency. Other unnecessary luxury goods and cosmetics are not included, but the import of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and tobacco alone has reached over 11 million yuan. No wonder Mr. Gui, an overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, upon arriving in Shanghai, felt that the extravagance and extreme desires of the Shanghai people were unacceptable to anyone with a conscience. At present, foreign exchange rates are fluctuating dramatically, and prices are rising. Anyone who feels the hardship of living should not be helpless and distressed, let alone blame heaven and earth. Everyone should first reflect on themselves. The creation of this phenomenon is not the responsibility of one person. Everyone who buys foreign goods should bear a part of the responsibility. The tightening of foreign exchange and the skyrocketing prices of foreign goods are due to the compulsion of objective circumstances. Our purchase of domestic goods has changed from "automatic" to "passive." Not buying foreign goods unless absolutely necessary is the minimum standard of living for wartime citizens. If this cannot be achieved, the current difficulty of living is just the beginning, and the difficulty in the future will be ten or a hundred times greater than today. Consider that the nation is still at war, and the government is making painstaking efforts to maintain foreign exchange rates. However, even for daily consumer goods, down to the smallest item like fruit, people still prefer American oranges and California apples. No matter how strong the government is and how abundant the stabilization fund is, how can it maintain the legal price of foreign exchange? The causes of this dramatic change in foreign exchange rates are very complex, and the impact is certainly very significant. However, the most affected are the general salaried class and housewives. In addition to tightening our belts to overcome this difficulty, there is something else we must pay attention to. Since we have suffered from the tightening of foreign exchange rates, no one should easily spend a single cent of foreign exchange in the future. In other words, we should not easily buy a single foreign product for the sake of the nation, the country, and even ourselves. This is a reflection given to us by the current lesson.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Beware of Hoarding Domestic Goods <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Cun</p>
<p>On the second of this month, the black market exchange rate suddenly changed, and the market reacted immediately. Everyone knows that as foreign exchange tightens, prices will rise. As a result, those with money rushed to buy large quantities of goods. It is said that the sales of the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road reached more than 60,000 yuan on this day, and customers were buying goods as if they were snatching them. These people who went to the company to buy goods did so entirely to avoid the losses caused by rising prices and had no choice but to buy more. This group of people certainly cannot be considered hoarders; they were simply doing what they had to do to protect their own interests. Seeing this situation reminded me of the high prices in the past. The tightening of foreign exchange rates was certainly a reason, but the hoarding and speculation of speculators was also an important reason. As foreign exchange tightens, the prices of foreign goods will inevitably rise, and the consumption of domestic goods will inevitably increase. Although some of the raw materials for domestic goods have to be purchased with foreign exchange, it can be asserted that the price increase of domestic goods will not be as severe as that of foreign goods. With this change in foreign exchange, the consumption of domestic goods has increased, and it is not impossible for speculators to turn their attention to domestic goods. To safeguard the lives of the public and prevent profiteering by speculators, we must loudly shout a slogan: "Beware of hoarding domestic goods!"</p>
<p>The speculators who engage in the hoarding of goods are certainly not scattered buyers, but large-scale bulk buyers. The coal merchant's warehouse receipts in the past are an example. At this time of unprecedented tightening of foreign exchange, domestic goods factories should be very careful about accepting orders and issuing order forms. Once the order forms fall into the hands of speculators, they immediately become the speculators' bargaining chips and are traded around. The goods cannot be sold on the market, and the prices also rise as a result. The producers and consumers lose contact and are instead manipulated and played by the speculators. This is detrimental to both producers and consumers, and it is hoped that domestic goods factories will pay close attention.</p>
<p>Industrial Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Production Method of Two Small Industries <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Xiongsheng</p>
<p>In our industrially backward country, the average citizen has little interest in industry. Now, I will introduce to you the simple production methods of two small industries. You might as well spend some money and time to make them, and that will arouse your interest!</p>
<p>A. Soap Production Method:</p>
<p>I. Materials:</p>
<p>(1) Tallow - 8 pounds</p>
<p>(2) Coconut Oil - 3 pounds</p>
<p>(3) Potassium Hydroxide - 14 taels</p>
<p>(4) Water - 25 pounds</p>
<p>(5) Baking Soda - a little</p>
<p>(6) Water Glass - a little</p>
<p>II. Production Method:</p>
<p>First, put the tallow and coconut oil in a pot and boil. Then, add potassium hydroxide, followed by an appropriate amount of water. Add a little baking soda, pour in the remaining water, and add water glass to increase the weight. Add rosin to make it foam. After freezing and solidifying, it can be used.</p>
<p>B. Ink Production Method:</p>
<p>I. Materials:</p>
<p>(1) Gallnuts - 3 cubic centimeters</p>
<p>(2) Water - 30 cubic centimeters</p>
<p>(3) Sulfuric Acid - a little</p>
<p>(4) Indigo - 2 cubic centimeters</p>
<p>(5) Ferrous Sulfate - 1 cubic centimeter</p>
<p>(6) Gum Arabic - 1 cubic centimeter</p>
<p>II. Production Method:</p>
<p>First, grind the gallnuts into a fine powder, add 30 cubic centimeters of water, and boil for five minutes. The liquid will then contain tannic acid. Filter it. Next, dissolve 1 cubic centimeter of ferrous sulfate in 10 cubic centimeters of water. Dissolve 2 cubic centimeters of indigo and 1 cubic centimeter of gum arabic each in 5 cubic centimeters of water. Then, mix all the prepared liquids together and stir. Add a drop of sulfuric acid, and blue ink is ready. To make different colors, simply change to different pigments.</p>

<p>— Xiongsheng</p>
<p>Raw Materials</p>
<p>(1) Cotton 47 taels.</p>
<p>(2) Caustic soda solution (made by dissolving 4 taels and 5 mace of pure caustic soda in 19 taels of water).</p>
<p>(3) Bleach (made by mixing 5 taels of bleaching powder in 18 taels of water and filtering it).</p>
<p>(4) Hydrochloric acid solution (made by mixing 1 tael and 2 mace of hydrochloric acid with 19 taels of water)</p>
<p>Production Method</p>
<p>(1) Put the cotton in the caustic soda solution and boil for about two hours, then take it out and remove the water.</p>
<p>(2) Put the previous cotton into the bleach to bleach it. After it is white, take it out and wring it dry.</p>
<p>(3) Place the wrung cotton in hydrochloric acid water for about one hour, take it out and dry it in the sun.</p>
<p>(4) Put the sun-dried cotton back into carbonic acid, soak it thoroughly, take it out, and dry it in the sun.</p>
<p>(5) Fluff the sun-dried cotton, and it is ready.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Developments in the Domestic Goods Industry <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Xiaoyan, the manager of the Singapore China National Products Company, recently came to Shanghai to purchase various domestic products. It is said that Singapore has recently imposed various restrictions on the import of foreign goods, and the market there is slightly inferior to before. However, due to the patriotic feelings of the overseas Chinese, domestic goods still have a large market in Singapore.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Zhizhen of the Changchen Factory recently came to Shanghai and reported that the factory has now started production.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Lizhong of the Jincheng Arts and Crafts Society went to the mainland to investigate the stationery industry and plans to set up a branch factory. He has now completed the investigation and will return to Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Gengmei of the China Pencil Factory sent Mr. Guo Zichun to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Pencil Factory. He has already purchased land and built a building, and it is expected to start construction next month.</p>

<p>I was very frightened when I heard this at the time. Later, as my knowledge increased, I gradually understood that this fear was unfounded, because this sun does not know how many tens of millions of years it can still burn. But there is a kind of fear that is not unfounded, that is, science is progressing so fast that this world may become unsuitable for habitation due to the explosion of human desires. For this reason, people today have an urgent need that has never been seen in history before. About four thousand and five hundred years after the Christian era, a barbarian tribe in Asia invaded Rome and wanted Rome to pay tribute. The people at that time called these barbarians Huns. What are Huns? They are not beasts, nor are they demons, but a kind of short people. Like others, they have a heart, but a small heart. They have compassion, but class-based compassion. They have ideals, but selfish ideals. They have a sense of duty, but a narrow, limited sense of duty. During the last European war, the Allied countries often scolded the Germans as Huns. But in a broad sense, this kind of person is not only found in Germany, but also among the working class, stubborn employers, partisan politicians, and stubborn pastors. In essence, anyone with narrow-minded thoughts, class-based compassion, and limited service is this kind of person. In the age of science, this kind of person is a threat to the world, whether in peace or war. Science and Huns, these two things, make the world terrible. Without science, the Huns are only a local threat. With science, they become a threat to the world. Unless these two things sever their relationship, the world will inevitably face war one day. Some people comfort themselves by saying that the last world war was the last war, but I think it is the beginning of many world wars, and future wars will be more severe than the last. Therefore, the connection between science and the Huns must be broken, or science must be eradicated, or the Huns must be eliminated. One of the two must be removed.

<h3 id="e117">Another Bad Habit to Be Eradicated <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— He Yichang</p>
<p>This publication recently carried an article entitled "Several Bad Habits That Should Be Abolished": Little friends, I presume you have already seen it. But in my opinion, in addition to the three bad habits of "eating snacks, reading comic books, and scribbling on paper," there is another bad habit that is easy to pick up and should be eradicated as soon as possible. This bad habit is "gambling," which is especially important in comparison. Nowadays, small businesses selling candy on the streets often involve gambling. They use candy, toys, etc. to lure children and swindle them out of their money. They carry all kinds of gambling tools and use various methods, such as "spinning candy carts, rolling dice, drawing Pai Gow, and drawing playing cards." In particular, drawing playing cards is the most common. They use several playing cards with several words written on them, such as "Aviation Saves the Country" and "The Civet Cat Exchanges the Prince." If it lands on a word and the one drawn is the same, you can win a prize. Once, I personally saw a primary school student in his teens, carrying a schoolbag, playing this kind of gambling at a candy stand. At first, he bet only a few cents, but later, after losing, he persevered. In less than a few minutes, he lost 8 jiao in legal currency. This kind of gambling is most common in front of primary schools and when school is dismissed. They shout "Give it a try, come and see." Little friends, driven by luck and thinking it is fun, often join in unconsciously. You should know that this kind of bad habit wastes money, hinders academic progress, and cultivates a gambling addiction from a young age, which will have unimaginable consequences in the future. Moreover, what you win is just candy and other things. Eating too much will also harm your health. There is also a kind of "gambling stall" on the side of the road, displaying various toys that are desirable, but secretly setting up traps. There are six or seven accomplices. They are all hooligans and rogues who swindle people out of their money. Little friends should stay away from them and never be fooled. In short, this kind of small business that lures people into gambling, on the one hand, we should hope that the police authorities will severely crack down on it. On the other hand, parents should constantly warn them, so that little friends can understand the harm in this and find other appropriate and beneficial pastimes during their time off from class!</p>
<h3 id="e118">A Casual Talk About Weight <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Long Jusheng</p>
<p>Tomorrow, May 6th, is the season of Lichun (Start of Summer) again. There is a custom of "weighing people." In childhood, I found "weighing people at Lichun" very interesting.</p>
<p>The original meaning of "weighing people" is to measure a person's weight as an indication of whether or not they are healthy. However, there are those who are stout but often sick, and those who are thin but full of energy. This is probably due to different adjustments in nutrition and diet, resulting in different conditions. What good is being stout if you are starving or overeating? What harm is being thin if you are eating three meals a day evenly?</p>
<p>My three children at school seem to be frail and skinny (because my family is not wealthy, and I rely on mental and physical labor to earn their rewards to feed them, but it is only coarse food and bland meals. They do not have the morning milk and evening ginseng to nourish them like wealthy families.) In fact, they jump and run and never get sick all year round. This is also because I strictly limit my children to eat evenly three meals a day and absolutely prohibit the bad habit of eating snacks. So, their weight is far from that of the children of wealthy families, but their spirits are always healthy and lively. My eldest child, Xisheng, is 14 years old, 52 inches tall, and weighs 53 pounds. His physical education score is 70. My second child, Xixian, is 11 years old, 47.2 inches tall, and weighs 45 pounds. His physical education score is 76. My third child, Xizeng, is 9 years old. He is 41 inches tall and weighs 40 pounds. His physical education score is 70. How can the weight of each of the three children reach the standard of health? (Wealthy families' babies weigh 10 pounds or 15 pounds when they are born.)</p>
<p>Little friends, it is certainly not to be ignored to pay attention to your own weight, but I think it is even more important to pay attention to adjusting (evenly) your three meals a day and to abstain from snacks. I hope you will experience it and put it into practice.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Visiting Zhao Feng Garden <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Huisheng</p>
<p>That Sunday, the weather was fine, and the spring sunshine was bright. In the morning, I returned home from school after completing my moral education class. My father said, "The weather is so nice today. After lunch, we will go to Zhao Feng Garden to play." I was very happy to hear that. After lunch, my father set off with me and my sister.</p>
<p>We first took the No. 24 trolleybus from the intersection of Lafayette Road and Sappho Road to the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road, and then changed to the No. 1 double-decker bus, which took us directly to Zhao Feng Garden. We saw that the entrance was full of cars and crowded with people. The ticket booth was crowded with people, especially crowded. My father spent a lot of effort to buy the tickets.</p>
<p>Entering the garden gate, a green color was presented before our eyes. Tourists were like ants, men, women, old and young, wearing colorful spring clothes, reflecting the bright flowers and plants, especially beautiful. There were particularly many Japanese men, women, and children, which made me feel very emotional!</p>
<p>We walked to the pond, surrounded by many people. Several children were playing with small sailboats by the pond, drifting in the pond, speeding in the wind, which was very beautiful. We lingered for a while and then walked to the left. We walked into a tall grove of trees and saw a pair of stone statues standing on both sides. Passing through the stone people, we found a red house like an ancient temple, where many people were resting. There was a pair of stone horses in front of the gate, and my sister and I competed to ride on them. We went around to the back of the temple and climbed a dirt mound, where many bamboos had been newly planted, but unfortunately, they had not yet grown lush. I looked out at the garden from the top and saw that the entire garden was full of tourists.</p>
<p>Going down the earth mountain, we walked along the winding path into the depths of the forest. We were like explorers searching for the zoo. Winding and winding, we walked many roads and passed the British barracks before we found the zoo. The first thing we saw was a group of tall, long-beaked cranes. My sister and I were seeing real cranes for the first time, and we found it very interesting. Walking into a small house, on one side were many beautiful birds, chirping; on the other side were monkeys, and some people were playing with them. Walking out of the house, we saw two very large black bears. Along the iron railings on one side, there were long-tailed peacocks, eagles, chickens, and various unknown birds with brightly colored feathers. On the other side, there was also a pair of tall deer, all very interesting.</p>
<p>We left the zoo and walked along another secluded path into the trees and flowers. There were small bridges, flowing water, and rockeries. The surrounding trees were dense, and various flowers were blooming in bright colors, with a fragrant aroma, making people feel indescribably happy! A woman was sketching, depicting the colorful flowers and trees in front of her. We seemed to be in a painting, but we felt that the painting could not fully depict it!</p>
<p>Walking out of the flowers, we arrived at a corner of the lawn, where many girls were playing volleyball. We walked straight to the east and crossed the large lawn to the small mountains on the east side. The small dirt mountains there were planted with lush pines, cypresses, flowers, and plants; at the foot of the mountain was a clear stream; it was like a miniature of high mountains and great rivers, with a different kind of interest.</p>
<p>Finally, we sat resting under the trees, eating sweet and cool purple ice cream. The three-hour tour of the garden made our legs a little sore. The crowds of tourists in front of us were constantly coming and going, as if it was the bustling Nanjing Road. Shanghai has so many people!</p>
<p>After resting for a while, we dragged our heavy steps onto the road home.</p>

<p>— Min</p>
<p>Caggie, sit up now, and I'll tell you a story; this story is about everything about me. You have to be mentioned in it, but it only takes up a very small part, because you are just a little Scottish dog.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad, my two older brothers, Jack and John, are also characters in this story. In addition, there are five rabbits, two speckled turtles, a curly-haired dog Rotae, and dolls sent from various places, including Italy, France, London, New York, Japan, and Honolulu. As for people, there are Janet Gaynor, Winfield Sheehan, my teacher Miss Buckland, Jimmy Dunn (who I love the most now), Gary Cooper, Mr. Will Rogers, who unfortunately died tragically last year, and Jack Donahue - in short, just prick up your ears and listen. You're just a little dog and don't know anything. I'm six years old and I'm growing up.</p>
<p>This story begins back in 1929, Caggie, the year I was born. Mom and Dad, and Dad's friends at the bank (Dad is a manager at a bank in Los Angeles), often call me "the Depression Baby." It was the year the national economy collapsed.</p>
<p>I didn't understand anything about collapse or non-collapse at the time, and I thought it was a lucky synonym, at least it was a lucky one for our Temple family. At the Academy Awards banquet last year, that red-faced and great Mr. Irving Thalberg gave me a little gold statue and said that Santa Claus dropped me down the chimney into the world, and that was good luck for millions of people everywhere. From this statement, it can be seen that this "Depression Baby" Shirley is not so bad.</p>
<p>Too bad you didn't see the house we used to live in. It wasn't as big as our current house, with only five small rooms and a garden. My crib was placed in Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was always with the two of them. Now I live in a room by myself, which is just right for putting all my dolls in. Mom and Dad also have their own room; even the two older children share a room. (John is at the military academy in New Mexico, so he doesn't actually enjoy the right) There is also a room downstairs, where my secretary, Dorothy Sandler, opens the many letters sent to me by fans and sends out my photos. In addition, there is a large kitchen, a dining room, and a beautiful and lovely hallway.</p>

<p>— San San</p>
<p>Before the First World War, a German madman who cried and laughed erratically lived on the eastern border of France. He had a strange habit of always going to the barren mountains to catch butterflies during the day. When it rained, he would spend the whole day in his house burying himself in drawing different butterflies. He lived alone like this and didn't mess with people, so people didn't pay attention to him.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the German General Staff suddenly had a young and handsome officer with an unfamiliar face who was studying military maps on the wall and contributing his novel strategies. Little friends, do you know who he is? He is the madman who drew butterflies!</p>
<p>It turned out that he was a German spy who had been assigned to the French border to scout the terrain of French fortresses. The butterflies he drew, when put together, were very detailed maps of the French eastern fortresses!</p>
<p>Little friends, would you like to be a sacred and mysterious little spy and serve your motherland?</p>

<h3 id="e122">A Casual Discussion on Costume Dramas <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Last year, when Ms. Chen Yunshang was invited to Shanghai to film the costume drama "Mulan Joins the Army," I wrote an article in this publication about "Mulan Joins the Army." I hoped that Ms. Chen would bring "a glorious contribution to sweep away the demonic atmosphere and refresh the eyes and ears," and that the filmmakers would "not focus too much on business and neglect reality." Although the release of "Mulan Joins the Army" did not achieve my expected result of "inspiring national spirit," it was still relatively correct in its consciousness in this isolated island at this time and place, when it was filled with荒淫,神怪 all sorts of evil atmospheres.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the special environment of this time and place, we naturally have nothing to say about making historical costume dramas to strengthen the audience's weakened will, and only by doing so can the producers grasp a more correct line of development. We do not bear to blame the playwrights, directors, and even the actors for this inevitable predicament.</p>
<p>But what is the impression that costume dramas have given us in the past year?</p>
<p>Because the material for costume dramas is quite extensive, under the smoke of history and costumes, costume dramas have become increasingly bizarre. As long as there is a female lead and the story is quite lively and familiar, from Investiture of the Gods, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Water Margin, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, to Conquest of the East, Conquest of the West, and even folk legends deeply imprinted in the minds of the lower classes, taking one corner of it can be made into a film. Although there is no lack of more profound meaning among them, there are also quite a few that deliberately reveal sensual, feudal, decadent, and mysterious ideas. Is this development of costume dramas what we expected at the beginning?</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun, as a literary master of his generation, could not turn the rewriting of old stories into a 洋洋巨著 of millions of words. The reason is that Mr. Lu Xun was not embarrassed by the material. He did not want to produce shoddy goods to deceive readers. The reason is very simple. Therefore, we feel that making costume dramas at this time and place has the same meaning as Mr. Lu Xun's rewriting of old stories. Putting aside all the theories of old wine in new bottles, new wine in old bottles, etc., it is inexcusable to harm the audience. We really have to have this feeling about the ever-declining quality of costume dramas.</p>
<p>In principle, we still do not oppose historical costume dramas, but we hope that those who make costume dramas will be brave enough to correct their mistakes. "Sticking to the old ways" is certainly undesirable, and "only pursuing profit" is really not worth learning from. Moreover, just钻，钻！钻！ into the dead end of costume dramas, will there not be a day when the iron is drilled to the end?</p>

<h3 id="e124">Notes on Entertaining Cheng Yanqiu <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Xinggu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School was established in the winter of last year, presided over by Xu Xiaochu, Chen Chengyin, Yu Yungu, etc. The school is located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Maran, which is the original site of the Diaochan Tea Room. Since its opening, it has only been four months, but the achievements have been quite remarkable. During the training, the school authorities have successively invited celebrities from all walks of life and Peking Opera actors to visit. They all praised the school's achievements. The day before yesterday, the school held another tea party, which was held to entertain Cheng Yanqiu. The time was 5 pm. In addition to Cheng Yanqiu, Jiang Miaoxiang, Liu Lianrong, and Wu Fuqin, the celebrities invited to accompany them included Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiying, Yuan Ludeng, and more than 50 others.</p>
<p>During the banquet, Principal Chen reported on the brief history of the school's establishment, and said that soon these boys and girls will meet with the gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai. Then Cheng Yanqiu gave a speech with a very amiable and elegant attitude, worthy of being a famous Dan角.</p>
<p>The prelude program was a chorus of "Wealth and Longevity" by all the male and female students. The second part was a female chorus of "Thinking of the Mortal World", which was very moving. The third part was Peking Opera, which was a six-year-old child singing "Entering the Palace Twice", and the tune was sung to the乙字, which was really not easy. The fourth was "Five Flower Cave" fighting. Originally, the program would end after the fighting, but because Yu Qiaqing also arrived during the "Five Flower Cave" fighting, but the old man was late and did not hear the previous 清唱, so he temporarily added a section of "Four Lang Visits His Mother" and a section of "Five Flower Cave", and it ended in joy at about 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>— Written by Yun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>Doufu Xishi Ju Lanying, nicknamed "Little Cabbage," was famous for her beauty, but she married Ge Xiaoda, who was unattractive!</p>
<p>The neighbor Yang Naiwu and Bi Lanying were of similar age and appearance, and they fell in love with each other. Bi Lanying originally complained about "a colorful phoenix following a crow" and blindly fell in love with Yang Naiwu. Later, Naiwu left home to take the exam, and Zheng Renlai, the son of the magistrate of Yuhang County, took the opportunity to become a guest in her boudoir. Bi Lanying's love affair was hot, and she conspired with Zheng Renlai to poison Ge Xiaoda. After the incident was exposed, she blamed Yang Naiwu, who was forced to confess under torture, and his injustice was not cleared!</p>
<p>Fortunately, his sister Ju Zhen was granted a request to file a complaint. The presiding officer induced Naiwu and Lanying into a room and eavesdropped on their confessions through a wall, and the truth was revealed. This matter is only more than sixty years ago.</p>

<h3 id="e127">So That's How It Is <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>These few major foreign exchange暴縮, prices have soared, and the market prices are so chaotic that they are inexplicable. People seen in the market during the day all show a kind of flustered look on their faces, but when the red lights come on, stepping into the restaurants, there are still red men and green women, drinking and talking wantonly, laughing and talking loudly. Each theater hangs up the signs of "full house" and "please come early tomorrow." The Huguang Theater parked several armored vehicles in front of it to show anti-German films, but it was also full inside.</p>
<p>Bored, I walked into the dance hall, listening to the melodious music and watching the pairs of partners swaying gracefully on the dance floor. When the music stopped and the lights came on, I couldn't help but look at everyone's faces, and they all showed a beaming look. I went to other entertainment venues to visit, and the same scene was presented. Alas, is it that the more chaotic the market is, the more people treasure wealth? Who is suffering? A dance star came over, and I asked him, "Are you affected by the rising prices?" He smiled and said, "How can I not be affected? Today I went to the stores and bought things worth several hundred yuan, I'm afraid they will rise even more. However, I used to make one or two thousand yuan of dance tickets, but now I have to make three or four thousand." Oh, so that's how it is.</p>
