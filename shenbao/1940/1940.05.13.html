<p>社評</p>
<h3>常識與理性之勝利</h3>
<p>自英法聯軍被迫退出挪威中部，一時危疑震撼，世人視綫咸集中於義大利之動向，蓋風雲際會，以東南歐洲及地中海之氣壓爲最低也。乃英國議會質辯尙未結束，荷比及蕞爾小邦之盧森堡已繼丹挪之後而遭池魚之殃，沉寂逾半載之西錢戰事亦呈如火如荼之概。侵略之熾慾方殷，人類之浩刧未艾，盰衡世運，誠有不勝其致慨者！</p>
<p>此度歐戰雖肇始於去歲九月初間，而雙方均審愼遲迴，其所消耗於外交戰經濟戰以及所謂神經戰者均遠逾於前綫之正式搏擊。遲至上月初旬，德國突以閃電戰略連犯丹麥挪威以攫取戰略上之先着，始爲主力戰行將交綏之前奏。今茲德方旣不惜再冒不韙，於萊茵下游假途比荷盧森堡以重取攻勢，雙方主力之決戰殆不遠矣乎。希冀歐戰避免擴大之望旣已全絕，於今倘能因戰禍蔓延而獲速戰速決之效，則較之任其拖續，使全世界長此遭受慢性宰割之苦者，兩害相權取其輕，似未必不此勝於彼。顧連日幻變之來，雖突元飄忽，令人起應接不暇之感，然而苟加剖析，則有如歐戰之發展，英閣之改組，以及印荷現勢等種種問題，殆咸可視爲常識與理性之勝利，茲姑就三者，略抒所見。</p>
<p>歐戰之延及比，荷等邦固屬諸國及其人民之不幸。而戰禍則始終局限於萊茵下游及北海沿岸一帶，猶差幸於四向蔓延無所底止。三數已前地中海局勢空前緊張，實則義大利固迄今仍未易其盤馬彎弓之姿態。德國之不移其兵鋒於抗力較弱，情勢較雜之東南歐洲，而獨循前此歐州之失敗途徑者，其故至足耐人深思。此雖水能驟即斷爲德義之間協調尙嫌不足，但至低限度，德國之作戰雖已屆今茲之嚴重關頭，竟猶未能獲得其唯一同盟國家之響應或助力，此實不能不視爲德方失敗之一端。而德國之甘冒不韙以取攻勢，在軍事上縱有其相當理由，另一方面，亦適足暴露其焦急不耐之窘態。往昔之併奧吞捷與攻波，在政治上尙有相當之藉口，於國際間亦能選擇最有利之時機；及迄近頃，則無所顧惜，無所抉擇，肆意橫行，有類在易，其所予世人之刺激殆更非已往暴行所能比擬，其猛騺固堪驚，其弱點亦盡現；鋒芒畢露，樹敵多端，今日之納粹德國，固自蹈於最危險之仄徑者也。</p>
<p>更就英閣之更易觀之：張伯倫連年身當國際巨變之衝；其苦心應付固有不容埋沒者在。然今日大戰悲劇之釀成，氏　難逃應負之愆咎。其閣僚中：西門爲「九一八」事變後袒日之罪魁，賀爾在東非戰役時亦有遷就侵略者之行徑，溯本淸源，均不能不謂爲此次大戰之間接負責者。連日英國兩院中對內閣之譴責，殆以此二氏爲最甚。雖歷史功過，今茲未屆淸算時機，然三氏之引退，究可視爲英國政策趨於澄淸明期之徵象。而邱吉爾之繼任閣揆與工黨人士之參與政府，則更予人以耳目一新之感。英國目前處境之艱危殆屬空前，固未可對新閣過存奢望，然其反侵略不妥協之立塲，無疑將較前閣爲堅定，其內外政策當亦轉趨開明，適與世人之期望相符合。</p>
<p>荷屬東印諸島，際此荷蘭本邦慘遭塗炭之際，處境之日趨嚴重自無可疑。顧英法縱不能以全力維護遠東之安寗，美國則已毅然肩此重荷；赫爾聲明旣一再表示其態度之堅決，復以强力艦隊留駐夏威夷以從事於實力之控制，則日閥野心雖熾未必不知難而止。如其不自量力，妄動圖逞，則適無異於以屆近耗竭之國力爲孤注以速其潰敗。就近頃之事態觀之，美國之關切遠東事變殆更甚於歐陸風雲，太平洋安寗和平之遭受危脅，蓋絕非美國所能忍受坐視，此則關心遠東機運人士所當引爲深慰者。</p>
<p>世事禍福相倚，窮極必變，歷史之演進亦然。十年以來，國際政治形勢日增加其陰翳之一面，迄於最近已屆於巔峯；則上述連日所發生之事變，足以視爲常識與理性勝利之明徵者，殆可視同世界政治機運吾極泰來。轉變之開端。近日侵華日軍之空前敗衂，亦適可代表侵略者無可避免之最後厄運。而世運演變能與世人之期望及推斷相符合，足徵今日人類間之最大權威仍捨正義公道莫屬，固不必因一時國際局勢之變化異常與局部戰禍之泛濫橫溢而驟感惶惑也。</p>

<h3>歐洲戰時三都景象（一）　燈火管制中倫敦市民的新生活</h3>
<p>英國軍略家當最初設想，每夜熄滅燈火，以免在敵機空襲時找到他們的目標，却沒有想到這種計劃實行之後，要影響到市民的慣常生活，文化的追求，甚至連帶及於他們的身體康健。</p>
<p>燈火管制已產生了若干怪異現象。它把天性善良，因傳統而養成保守性的百姓，硬孜孜的造成許多新習慣。統制政策正產生文化上的孤獨主義。對於若干人增進了昌盛繁榮，若干人於生計方面却遭受了意外損失。偶爾還要使向來欣然的英國人，發洩他胸中的無明之火。</p>
<p>許多商行店舖和機關已將他們從前牢不可破的工作時閒，大爲更動。冬季日短，很多的商行眞早兩小時或兩小時以上關鬥，俾職員們在還未逢到燈火熄滅之前得以返家，减少途中的交通擁擠，和車馬肇禍的危險。目下春已到來，日間又實行惜時運動，工作的辰光又已延長了。</p>
<p>返家以後，大家都打算怎樣來消磨這漫漫長夜。有些人不高興冒着重露濃霧到漆黑的外面去的，便在家中聽聽無錢電收音，或是打紙牌，還有些人則埋首書中，以爲消遣。但是夜復一夜，在這樣刻板文章的生活之下，却不免引起了人們需要新奇玩意兒的老調。</p>
<p>許多被困於家的人產生了自己譜樂的需求。因之土　音樂倒也風行一時。有能力的人多去購買鋼琴—音韻鏗鏘的小號批亞拿，可以安放在任何角落裏，雖室小人衆倒也無妨。雖則這些人從來沒有玩過鋼琴，或者日久生疏，却也無害於事。音樂函授可以解決一切。爲了大家傾向於音樂，家庭樂隊應運而起。有一種英國的老式管樂器，好像筆　般的，因爲易於奏弄，聲音高下自如，現在父到處流行。一家中人往往大家人手一支，合奏作樂。更有些家庭實行團體歌唱，自尋雅趣。</p>
<p>另外一件舊習常亦由燈火管制而產生—因爲太舊太陳腐的緣故，有許多人倒爲新奇了—就是一家人圍爐而坐，把書本輪流朗誦。古文學，新小說，和雜誌等，從前大家沒有工夫閱讀的，現在人執一卷，許多人以爲談論資料。</p>
<p>許多奇異現狀之中，尤以硏究天文學一事爲最。大家對於天文星象，向來一知半解，或從未學習過的，現在却儘多在仰首翹望觀察天象了。</p>
<p>請客赴宴或邀友作夜間娛樂者，免不了一個「但」字，就是那一夜，碰巧月色皎潔，那末客人們因爲易於往返，一定賓至如雲。天上沒有月亮，人間便無宴會。</p>
<p>向來視爲當然而現在又覺得可喜的，這些妙事也不一而足。讀了關於月亮的書，大家轉向注意到星象，他們的名稱，方位等等。燈火熄滅對於這班外行硏究者，倒予他們以很大觀察天象的帮助；天空之間星棋羅布，一碧燦爛，附近城鎮毫無雜光，這對於上窺天文者眞是最適宜不過的呀。</p>
<p>燈火管制和從人烟稠密區中撤退婦孺，這兩件事合併起來，倒增進了人家的新友誼和新關係，因而擴展了人們的「勢力圈」，認識了不少朋友，添加了無數興趣。</p>
<p>倫敦郊居的某一有資產人家，很可舉以爲例，這個大家庭的父親把小孩和祖父母送往鄉間的安全區後，他妻子却自願和他住在市郊。</p>
<p>夫婦兩人未免感覺寂寞起來。後經友人介紹，認識了幾個已婚的人，因爲他們的家庭都已撤退，便邀請這夫婦兩人住在他們屋中空室裏，大家互相分擔家用。從此開始了自治團體的生活，家長們都住在一宅之中，開支因分擔關係而大家减輕，享受普遍的與趣，增加了不少的新朋友。</p>
<p>在這種新狀態下，有的獲得意外職務，有的却遊手好閒起來，有的人掙了不少錢，有的人憑空賠了本。可說得捉摸不定，反覆無常。</p>
<p>以函授爲生的音樂敎師他們的收入日有增加，向來面授的樂師却進益逐漸减少了。大城市中心的幾家影戲院，因爲夜間燈火熄滅，看客們不願摸索，售票收人大爲低落。市郊鄰近的幾家因爲近爲咫尺，倒是門庭若市了。</p>
<p>燈火熄滅對於工廠，碼頭，公事房，和船塢中做夜工作者的身體已發生了影響。像碼頭卸貨的工人就要每天工作二十四小時。關於這些康健問題，已引起了商務聯合局和內部官員們的注意，而加以檢討。</p>
<p>這决戰事中，英幽無數的戰鬭員每日的勞苦生活，和習慣上，因燈火管制而受到新的色彩，有的很光明，有的却很黯淡哩。（譯紐約泰晤士報雜誌）</p>

<h3>外匯前途如何（二）</h3>
<p>— 夏芝</p>
<p>本文以當前情勢懸測外匯前途爲主，與本刋二四四—五期「法幣前途如何」一文，以法幣本身展望其前途，有買串性；後者雖二年前作，但所論各點，絕未變化，月將永不變化，可以參讀。</p>
<p>本文共分十二節，將陸續分戰本刋，茲先提示其網自如次：</p>
<p>一，現在應該啞然失笑了（上期）　二，「金庫券」與平準基金（上期）</p>
<p>三，「限制提存」與盜案迭起（上期）　四，「不維持」比維持更難（本期）</p>
<p>五，中美匯兌合作之可能性（本期）　六，貿易入超與平準基金（待續）</p>
<p>七，法幣金準備與在外資金（待續）　八，盧布馬克的破產眞相（待續）</p>
<p>九，「自然水準」與人爲水準（待續）　十，外幣價値與投權利益（待續）</p>
<p>十一，歐戰擴大與美匯前途（本期）　十二，日僞搗亂之最大限度（待續）</p>
<p>歷來黑匯市塲之波動，人果皆知其爲「人心虛」，故易受種種造謠中傷者所鼓動；然則何以虛？不瞭解現實眞相而發生錯覺，一也；缺乏判斷能力而易受惑言包圍，二也；愛惜私財而不知保持其私財之合理方法，三也；投機者又各抱「他人做，我何獨不做」之心心理，四也。故歷來事實雖無不將謠言粉碎，但每當謠言再起時，各人心理上竟父不克自主。故本文旨在提供種種有關匯市前途之種種基本事實，藉以帮助讀者增强其判斷力，俾人人在心理上有所準備。本應按各節程序順次發表，茲因歐戰擴大，美滙前途之變化，關係本市黑滙者尤深，故先將該節提早發表，餘則仍按次刋載。</p>
<p>本文所述若干部份，曾於五月八日八仙橋靑年會宴會席上演說時提及，因署名不同，恐滋誤會，特附言註明。</p>
<p>「不維持」比維持更難</p>
<p>從五月二日發生風潮至五月六日港方才來供給；之前，什麽消息都沒有。大家期待財部的消息愈熱切，財部的態度却似乎愈沉默。因此人心更慌，市塲上紛傳「財部已決定永遠放棄上海的黑匯市塲」。爲了不維持黑滙市塲的這種政策，素經一般學者們的研究和倡導；歷决外滙黑市的激變，又莫不先由匯豐銀行停止供給而開始。雖則每當完戎了停止供給的意義之後，旋即恢復供給。但每次停止供給，市塲上每次都擔心着「這次也許眞的不再維持了」。這種心埋，異常普遍。此次財部的沉默旣特別利害，因此這種謠言給人的威脅程度也特別利害。這種威脅，現在雖已解除。但還有不少人提心吊膽地認爲「總有道麼一天」。這實在是太不明事理的杞憂。因爲財政部的政策是一貫不變的。而且父非此不可的。</p>
<p>姑不談財部的基本政策，也不談「不維持」的後果怎樣？即退一步從「有無實行不維持的可能」來說，就可以堅信這個「不維持」政策，政府決不會付之實施。頭腦簡單的人或認爲「不維持」是一件最容易的事。殊不知「不維持」實比「繼續維持」更難。因爲政府有的是實力，只要不惜以寳貴的抗戰資源，供上海人的揮霍，就可以完成「維持」的效果。若果一旦眞的「不維持」了，那就立刻惹出許多不能解決的複、雜問題。</p>
<p>從理論上說：黑匯是非法的；進出的又是日僞和那批沒有愛國觀念的投機份子；政府何必維持？此其一。黑匯價値根本不能代表法幤的眞實價値；不維持黑匯故無碍於法幣。此其二。事實問題就不能如此簡單。</p>
<p>黑匯市價不能代表法幣的眞價値是無可疑義的；黑滙市價的存在，在法幣的眞價値之外，無形中又製造了一種强姦法幣的市塲購買力，也是無可否認的。這種市塲購買力，經過上海對內地的貿易關係，直接間接中影響內地物價。戰時物價趨勢本漲，因貨運等關係而其漲勢更大；豈容再受黑匯市塲的影饗？一般學者，雖覺上海的黑匯市塲，是中國抗建經濟運行上的一大漏洞。以維持來塡塞這個無底洞，實屬不智；不僅喪財，縱法，資敵，結果還是無法消滅他的影響。「與其繼續無效的維持而徒喪資財，不如爽性一刀兩斷，根本不予維持爲優」。然而這是意氣之言，國家決不能感情從事。今日的上海，對於抗建的貢獻，雖不足道。但搗亂則有餘。用「不維持」來膺懲黑滙市塲是應該的，但必先有所準備，才能消滅具搗亂的可能。而這種準備：</p>
<p>第一先要樹立一個完備而又强有力的物價統制網。</p>
<p>第二先要充分完成必需品的內地之自給自足。</p>
<p>第三才可以割斷內地和上海的貿易關係。</p>
<p>第一個條件的完成，尙賴於後面兩個條件的完成。以內地的經濟資源和目前建設猛晋的速率來說，要完成這三個條件，果然毫無問題。但總須有相當的時間。然而在這時間的配合之下，恐不待上述各條件的完成，狄人已因挨不住他國內經濟的崩潰而全綫敗退了。所以「不維持」云云雖合乎國策利益，實行上却比維持更小容易。繼續維持，雖明知其不智，事實上還是非維持不可。不過爲了要减少維持上的不利，所以偶行暫停供給，藉以粉碎日僞的套買。但一等完成此種目的，必然還是努力維持不怠。所以唯恐不維持而想逃避資本，結果必越逃避而資本損失越大。目前他們或許還不會發現他們的損失，但等他發現時已無法挽救。</p>
<p>中美滙兌合作之可能</p>
<p>美國名教育家孟祿博士最近公開主張「美國應以財力援助中國的法幣」；在滬美僑且聯電美總統，響應這種主張，重視消息的市塲，</p>
<p>匯兌本是國際間的經濟結台，在平等相待的二國以至二個以上的國家間，爲了靖進彼此商業上的利益，穩定彼此間的匯價，實屬必要；由此而發生的權利義務也彼此相等，所謂「援助」，詞義實不相當。中國以低匯率爲有利，因可以抑制入超，調整國蔡收支。所以穩定中外匯價，英美所得的利益實比中國多；更無所謂「援助」。就此而論：英美之樂於「援助中國法幣，殆無疑義。何况此外還有許多政治上的必要。</p>
<p>中國被迫抗戰，原以確保中華民族獨立目由生存與主權完整爲目的；所以取得了全世界公正國家的熱烈同情與援助。英美在遠東擁有特殊權位，日本侵華係其獨霜遠東排斥英美勢力的第一步。因此英美同情與援助中國的抗戰，較他國尤爲自然而必要。所以日本對華侵略一天，中英滙兌合作也必繼續一天。雖　歐戰擴大不無增大英國兼顧遠東問題的困難，但此區區負擔，在英究無問題。况英國是重視現實的，提供此渺小的負擔，換取中國廣大的友誼，更何樂而不爲！</p>
<p>至於美國，果本對華成立滙兌合作；但非美政府無意及此，而係中國政府無意於此。這點應該特別提出的。如前如述：維持黑滙，並非合乎國策。中國需要的是合理的貿易，與合理的物價。那就是說：一面希望必需品在高滙　裏進口，他方希望非必需相奢侈品　低滙價的抑止而阻止其進口。黑市滙價的變動，是無區別地影響於必需品與非必需品。因此對於黑滙價以維持於一個　低的水凖爲有利；對於獎勵必需品的進口，祇有別樹機。法定匯市的維持，各國對華出口信明的取得，便是現行的主要　策。以中英合作來維持黑滙市塲，已綽乎有餘。對於他國，則以取得對　出口信用爲重要。近年美國供給中國的出口信用，公開的已有二次，計五千萬美元。由此可見只要中國政府有意，那末美政府必樂於和中國成立滙梵合作，像今日中英滙兌合作一樣。所以中美成立滙兌合作，有其絕劉的可能；但尙無這種必要。由此亦可以反證「中英滙兌平凖基金業已用罄」之說的荒謬。</p>
<h3>歐戰擴大與美滙前途　此係「外匯前途如何」第十二節</h3>
<p>德軍侵犯荷比盧專中立國後，歐戰才眞正走進了第二次世界大戰的規模了。限制提存，截留債權，管理貿易，統制外滙，這一串封鎖資金與控制資金國際流動的戰時政策，勢必一個個地在戰爭國家展開着。强化着，直接的結果是國際滙兌市塲首先激起空前的變動；間接的結果是：所有戰爭國家以及暫守中立而終於要參戰的各國之貨幣本身的前途，免不了也要跌進不可知的命運之流而難於逆料。此際最堪注意的，當然是美滙了。</p>
<p>就美國在世界經濟中的地位來論，歐戰擴大，雖可以使其他國家的貨幣感受嚴重的威脅；至於美國，反得獨受其惠。主要的，其故有四：（一）各國資本之紛紛逃入美國，或紛紛轉變爲美金而害藏。（二）戰爭國家對美國商品的需要增大，而增大美滙的需要。（三）不論美國參戰，或始終維持其中立，美洲境內總　致　生戰爭，因此他的經濟勢必益益發展，美金的基礎也就益益强固。（四）美國經濟，在平時果會發生生產　剩等恐慌，以致不得不實行低滙價故策以謀海外市塲的獲得與維持。現在，他無形中巳成戰爭物資的主要供給國。他唯恐生產不足，決小會再有生產過剩的威脅。在外市塲旣極確實而廣大，因此他就決無冉行貶値政策之理。他雖小曾高抬其滙價而實行趁火打刦；至少將放任其幣値的上昇，俾在商業　益外，再取得些滙兌上的利益。</p>
<p>但是從美國在國際政治上的地位來說：情形却就適得其反。他之嫉惡侵略國家，不僅是由於心理上的愛好和平，主要的尙在於維持他雄踞世界霸王地位上所必要；甚至爲確保其資本中義恒久發展上所必要。顯然的：萬一日本在遠東眞的擊敗了中國（事實是不會的），那末非特他在遠東的旣得權益小易維持；他在遠東的商品市塲將被日貨所攫佔。而且將以中國的豐富資源，助長日本帝國主義的發展，結果，小僅是太平洋永不太平；而且美國的東部國境以及巴拿馬運河乃至南美洲和阿達斯加等等的安全，都將感受日本帝國主義的威脅。因爲日本勢力的膨脹，就是美國實力的相對跌落。因此美國對華抗戰的同情與援助，不僅是道義感，實也是他本身的和害感。美國的遠東政策，一言以蔽之：若不能澈底解除日本對他的威脅，至少需幫助中國的力能毫掣日本而維持太平洋上的均勢。截至今日，他的遠東政策，態度上雖已十分明顯，行動上尙不够積極。與具說他做着「孤立夢」，母寗說他在「等機會」。這機會是什麽呢？英德　妥協或歐戰擴大，都不失爲其中之一。而現在來的，那就是歐戰擴大。</p>
<p>美國的歐洲政策，是維持一個無選擇的均勢。所以他可以同意德國的勢力多少擴張些，却也贊成英法維持現　的主張。因爲這都不足以使歐洲的均勢失墜。在這原則之下，他之不願捲入關係過於複雜的歐洲糾紛，大概是事實。但是看到德國把奧捷先後兼併之後，心理上以及利害關係上，無疑的已傾向英法。德波戰事旣起，歐戰規模事實上已經形成；但英法尙不立刻採取積極進攻的戰略，只是向中立國方面埋佈棋子。戰火從波蘭，而芬蘭，而丹麥，而挪威一步步展開，英國的情緒也一天天緊張。他擔心英法不再急起進攻，那末德國勢力不斷膨脹的結果，在眞正歐戰展開的時候，英法就要處於不利的地位。無疑的：他要恢復歐洲的均勢，一發現英法不能支持時就要立刻參戰。但是他要參加歐戰，第一步必需先要解除日本在遠東方面給他的威脅。現在歐戰雙方均勢尙米打破之前而戰事已因荷比盧的被侵而擴大，美國便可先從經濟上援助英法而母需立刻參加歐戰，以便傾力於遠東問題的解決。不錯：蘇意二國的態度，目前尙未明朗；美國行動上多少還有若干顧慮。譬如意國竟加入德國對英法宣戰，美國在歐洲的負擔勢必就要立刻增加。但大體而論：美國必先從經濟上援助英法，同峙父以先解除日本給他的威脅爲前提，大槪是已定的趨勢了。是則：美滙的前途，就不能只從經濟觀點上懸測了。</p>
<p>德波戰事爆發前後，英鎊對美匯率已在步續。爲了英美利害大體一致，所以早有人估計美國勢必以穩定　美滙兌作爲對英的一種援助。這種看法是對的，但時間上却看錯了。因爲在荷比盧沒有被侵之前，英國對德的戰略似乎側重於經濟封鎖和政治包圍。這種戰略，只是妨碍別國的利益和自由。誠非美國所願同意。所以在英法成立戰時貨幣協定時，美國便托詞戰前早有三國貨幣協定而拒絕另訂。同時英國亦願意放任英鎊相當跌價，以刺激他國內的增產，以至吸引他殖民地內貨物的輸英。故也不欲千涉匯市。現在却就不同：爲了要確　他長期作戰的財力，爲了要增强他對海外軍需品的購買力，目不能丹放任其英鎊的續落，而美國基於前述的理山，就調整英美滙兌水準米作爲經濟上援助協約國的一種手段，也是最有可能的一件事了。</p>
<p>美國國會上，早已成立二條決議：那就是授權羅斯福總統在緊急時期，實行統制外匯；並代行管理戰爭國家在美的存款和一切資產。前一條決議的付諸實施，美滙的賣買自由便不復存在。同時美國對利害相同的各國貨幣，必設法維持一個適合於政治目的的匯率。後一條決議的實施，那就是從截留外國存款以記合其政治上的作用：如現在截留挪丹存款以防流人德人之手，便是一例。於是從上海逃避到美國去的那批資金，也難保不接受中國政府的要求而加以截留，以免落入日僞之手呢？</p>

<h3>日本勞工生活之悲哀</h3>
<p>日本勞工生活的悲慘，可說是自古皆然；而以戰時今日爲尢甚，原因是：統治階級因勞力不足故，儘量延長工時；形式上雖給以增加工資的待遇。實際呢，物價的上漲，遠較其工資增加率爲高。下表便是東京金鋼鎭雜誌社調査的指數，均以昭和七年九月至翌年八月止爲基年，日本　工收支不足之狀，已屬顯而易見。何况他之所謂生計費，尙依據所謂公定價格計算，而民間的購買，事實上都依黑市塲價格支付的哩！因此日本勞工生活的悲哀，較之下表的程度必更高。（單位一日元）</p>

<h3>紀念母親節　以精忠報國赦勉　滬婦女界闡揚重大意義　報答母恩應盡至忠至孝</h3>
<p>昨日爲國際母親節、滬市婦女界爲紀念計、特發表吿婦女書、以資宣揚而昭鼓勵、並派員分赴各難民收容所慰問難民、茲錄吿婦女書如下、</p>
<p>民族偉人賣母訓導</p>
<p>今天是五月的第二個星期日、是國際母親節、我們紀念這個節期的意義、是因爲母親是未來民族生命力的培護者、未來民族文化綫的傳授者、母親的責任、是十分重大、母親的工作、是十分神聖的、在從前的中國、女性雖是被輕視、但對於母親、却都存着尊敬的心理、那許多立功於國家、造福於民族的偉人、更無一不是由於賢母所訓導的、我們看斷機勉學的孟母、和刺背勵忠的岳母、就是其中顯著的例子、在暴風雨當前的今天來紀念母親節、比年年此日的紀念自有不同的意義、</p>
<p>鼓勵子女盡忠盡孝</p>
<p>現在從（一）怎樣負母責的一方面講講、做母親的應該明白你們是為着繼承民族的生命、和綿延民族的文化而養育子女、因之、對子女不能存着自私的觀念、從小就該養成子女有愛護國家、愛護民族的觀念、使他們不僅做成賢淑的子弟、尤其要做成忠勇的國民、在國難嚴重的今天、每一個做母親的、都應當步着岳母訓導岳飛精忠報國的精神、訓導子女、鼓勵子女、並進一步應當爲國家爲民族獻出你們的子女、以盡至忠、以盡至孝、（這樣才算盡了母親的責任、再從</p>
<p>光大民族報答母恩</p>
<p>（二）怎樣報母恩的一方面講、母親從懷胎哺育以至成人、不知費了多少心血和精力、所以做子女的是應當克盡反哺、不要遺日後「子欲養而親小在」之感再者母親是爲着繼承民族的責任、和綿延文化的責任、而養育和訓導米來民族的生命力的、那做子女的就應當體會這偭意思來光大民族來發揚文化、這才足以報答母恩、在紀念母節約今日、不僅是要用儀式來紀念、更要用行動來紀念認定國家至上民族至上、拿出苦幹·實幹·快幹·的精神努力做去、我們都是母親的孩子、我們也都是孩子的母親、我們願意自勵勵人、自惕惕人、來紀念今日的母親節、</p>
<h3>葉琛部抵淞滬近郊　華軍聯絡就緒　兩路沿綫正在疏散人口　顧復生部已開赴新陣地</h3>
<p>東戰塲淞滬近郊各地、日僞積極騷擾、揚言肅淸掃蕩、與華軍顧復生部、發生遭遇、鏖戰三日夜、日軍匪特毫無所獲、且受重挫、死傷日軍三百餘、因此集結江南三十餘據點之守備日軍僞軍、大肆圍攻、幸賴顧部勁旅、素與黨政密切聯絡、對於政訓工作、灌輸有方、一旦發動戰爭、即能以敏捷神勇之對策、予日人以</p>
<p>迎頭痛擊</p>
<p>因是遷怒民眾、信從匪黨呂發章黃霈澤陸惠人等請求、扶持僞政權之建立、與僞和平新軍許當聲（即連生）蔣阿可（即永昌）不惜殘民以逞、釀成滬郊各地二十餘日夜之空前屠殺、詳情巳誌各報、當時最高軍事長官據報、立電分飭各路整訓新軍、陸續東開、近沿京滬路杭嘉路分途推進、已就衝要地區、</p>
<p>疏散人口</p>
<p>軍運忙碌、連日嘉湖一帶及丹宣奉南各地、已發生大規模之流動戰、而顧復生部自移駐安全地帶後、日夜加緊政訓、補充彈藥、業巳配備充實、已陸續開赴新陣地佈置反攻形勢、預料各部聯絡就緒、即將大舉反掃蕩戰、且聞新四軍舊部之業琛部、已到達嘉太縣境、已與浦東浦南各地華軍取得密切聯絡、定能出奇制勝、</p>
<h3>維護戰區事業　原有權益</h3>

<h3>蔣委員長　愈受民眾擁戴　民眾甘受苦難抗戰益堅　菲名記者暢談中日戰局</h3>
<p>昨日大陸報星期週刊、發表菲律賓自由報駐滬名記者努根力格氏痛斥日本侵華戰事一文、該文首先指出日本處置對外關係之手段、狡猾逈異尋常、例如美國以日本迭次破壞國際條約、施用非人道方法從事戰爭及損害美國在華之權益等事、向日提出抗議、在所有抗議中、均詳列事實、日本如欲聲辯該項抗議、彼當暴露其所列事實之錯誤、或解釋情形之不得已、但事實昭彰、不容日本掩飾、故其辯護之方式、異常狡展、日本口口聲聲、謂從事「聖戰」、以建立「東亞新秩序」、無論在何種情形之下、彼終反覆以「聖戰」之口號、以應付一切抗議、實則所謂「聖戰」者、僅侵略之別名而已、</p>
<p>日方破壞國際條約</p>
<p>日本爲九國公約簽字國之一、在條的上須尊重中國主權及領土之完整、並當以和平方法、解決一切國際糾紛、然日本一反其所應爲、以武力攫取東北、發動侵華戰爭、則其所稱聖戰、」實藉口破壞國際公約、以實行侵略、是故、據力格氏之意見、僅最無智識之日人方信之、所謂「聖戰」者無他、代表日人之各種暴行而已、日本平民斷不如日軍閥之侵略成性、而日軍閥予日本以永不能磨滅之恥辱、則可無疑義也、日本旣屢次以「聖戰」之口頭禪應付各國抗議、美國及世界各邦、旣知其不可理喩、豈將長此忍受日本之侮蔑耶、列强亟應速即採取有效行動、以對付日本也、</p>
<p>外交地位陷於孤立</p>
<p>力格氏於其文中、復談及日本與蘇聯之關係、日本因外交之陷於孤立地位、正實行絕對矛盾之政策、一方面亟欲與蘇聯「調整關係、同時向民主國家宣稱、日本在亞洲担任「防共」之責、日方以「防共」爲烟慕、企圖掩護侵華之舉、日人之侵華、適以促成中國更團結一致耳、關於日本製造傀儡政府問題、力格氏謂目下日本民衆、厭戰情緒極高、故日本當局不得不製造一僞「政權、」與之訂立」「和平條約、」俾和緩民衆之厭戰、同時可藉此排斥列强在華之權益、</p>
<p>中國抗戰意志堅強</p>
<p>中國民衆現正在偉大之民族抗戰中受難、但彼等雖備受艱苦、絕不足以動搖其爲獨立自由而奮鬥之決心、反之、愈益增强其抗戰信念耳、中國軍人、包括以前反對蔣委員長者、亦一致受蔣委員長之指揮、參加抗戰、聯合陣綫日益鞏固、於投靠日偽者、均爲無名之土豪劣紳、該文結論謂中國民衆在目前環境下、必斷然唾棄偽組織無疑、</p>
<h3>加捐案雖經通過　仍請展緩實行　物價漲風開埠以來未有　權宜變通深望當局考慮</h3>

<h3>日兵毫無輿地常識　不知有瑞士與瑞典兩國　瑞僑赴津被阻啼笑皆非</h3>
<p>大陸報云、旅滬瑞士與瑞典僑民各一、近因商務、赴天津一行後返滬、據談、其入津市所遇困難稱、彼等兩人乘船行抵天津舊俄租界河濱登岸時、各以本國護照出示駐守河濱之日哨兵、該兵接瑞典人之護照、加以細察後、即行交還、謂渠從未聞瑞典國名、就渠所知、地圖上並無瑞典國家、該哨兵並對同行之瑞士人謂渠從未聞名喚瑞士之地、兩人聞悉之餘，頗爲沮喪、返船商諸船長、卒持地圖一幀、再度登岸、以歐洲地圖示諸哨兵、指明歐洲確有瑞典與瑞士兩國、日哨兵對地圖審愼硏究後、始准兩人入津市、</p>
<h3>發行偽「幣」　日商反對</h3>
<p>對於法幣　信仰甚堅</p>
<p>據英文六美晚報發表經濟專家約翰愛拉氏、檢討中日紙幣問題一文、彼謂「新政權」擬發行一種新偽幣、但該偽幣諒不與日圓連絮、蓋日人對於以日圓連繫在華發行之僞幣措施、早已感覺不滿、即以過去連繫僞華北聯台準備銀行之紙幣「成績」而論、使一般日本人士、</p>
<p>大感失望</p>
<p>東京當局目下認爲在華流通之日圓紙幣價格之價跌、因其連繫僞幣所致、故新僞幣之發行、如與任何外幣連繫、定將蹈偽「華興票」之覆轍、據愛拉氏推測、新僞幣將不與任何外幣連繁、其價値」高低、僅視命運而定、反對在華中發行新僞幣最烈者、　爲</p>
<p>日本商行</p>
<p>然彼輩在高壓下、固不敢暢所欲言、彼輩以爲中國法幣、仍爲最優良之紙幣也、故本市日商界對法幣波動、並未感覺所謂樂觀、蓋日圓對法幣之匯水、與四月間相同、目較本年初尤低、是故日圓顯隨法幣之波動而跌價、偽華北準備銀行票在四月間曾與法幣同價、但目前又行慘跌、過去經騐如斯、故目前所籌劃之種種試騐、結果必不能一逞也、</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>新生活與衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 陳念雲</p>
<p>日昨偶展讀『新生活須知』，見內對食，衣，住，行的準則，曾有分別的規定；今照錄於后：</p>
<p>食：飲食養生，人之大欲。食貴定時，莫恣口腹。食具須凈，食物須潔。要用土產，利勿外溢。遇酒母酗，食量有節。飲嚼無聲，坐必正席。飲屑骨刺，母須狼藉。宴客聚餐，相讓舉筷。注意微菌，生冷宜戒。鴉片屛絕，紙烟勿吸。恥養於人，自食其力。</p>
<p>衣：衣服障身，禮貌所寄。莫趨時髦，樸素勿恥。式要簡便，料選國貨。注意經用，主婦自做。洗滌宜動，縫補殘破。拔上鞋跟，扣齊鈕顆。穿戴莫歪，體勿赤裸。集會入室，冠帽即脫。被褥常曬，行李輕單。解衣贈友，應卹貧寒。</p>
<p>住：住居有室，創業成家。天倫樂聚，敦睦母譁。黎明即起，漱口刷牙。剪甲理髮，沐浴勤加。建築取村，必擇國產。牆壁勿汚，家具從簡。窗牖多開，氣通光滿。愛惜分陰，習勞勿懶。當心火燭，謹愼門戶。莫積垃圾，莫留塵土。廚房厠所，尤須凈掃。捕鼠滅蠅，通溝淸道。和洽隣里，同謀公益。互救災難，種痘防疫。國有紀念，家揚國旗。敬旗敬國，升降循規。</p>
<p>行：行是走動，行亦作爲。舉止穩重，步武整齊。乘車搭輪，上下莫擠。先讓婦孺，老弱扶持。走路靠左，胸部挺起。兩目平看，端其聽視。拾物歸主，相識見禮。遇喪知哀，觀火勿喜。對人噴嚏，吐痰在地，任意便溺，皆所禁忌。公共塲所，遵守紀律。就會退席，魚貫出人。莫作吵鬧，莫先搶說。聞黨國歌，肅然起立。的會守時，做事踏實。應酬戒繁，嫖賭絕跡。</p>
<h3>談談穿衣</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>穿衣服的愛惜與否，對於衣服的本身影響很大，譬如同樣算料的一件衣服，在某甲穿了一年已破，可是某乙却能穿上二年還不破，這可就從愛惜不愛惜裏分出　高低來了；當然，能愛惜總可穿得久長些。</p>
<p>還有，穿衣服不論綢緞做的或布做的，總以整潔爲主，穿件整齊而淸潔的布衣，要比穿件汚而皺的綢衣好看得多，所以在臥室內，最好脫去外衣，折疊整齊的安放，切勿　放在凳上或牀上，因爲衣服皺了穿起來很難看，何况還司免去灰塵的侵襲呢！</p>
<p>關於袍子，最好總要用罩衫，穿罩衫的好處眞多，旣可免去袍子的受髒，又可保護袍子的質料，一舉二得，何樂而不爲？想起在鄉間，十人之中有九人都穿罩衫，逢着吃喜酒或到親友處去，祗須把罩衫一脫，就可像穿着新衣一樣了。可惜在都市的人都不贊成這一套，好像穿了有些土老兒式，認爲寒酸，其實這有什麽關係呢？</p>
<p>近來衣料莫不漲得很貴，做一件袍子至少費去數十元，眞是做衣做小起，所以我們須把衣服看得着重些，保管得好些，免得在　是生活問題已被鬧得焦頭爛額之際，冉要躭心着衣服的添製問題。</p>
<p>其次，下雨天把褲脚义起走路，處處留心受贓……等等，也都是愛惜衣服之道。</p>
<h3>談屑</h3>
<h3>行</h3>
<p>有時，慈禧后命廚司每餐備不同之菜肴凡百，每肴盛以金質或銀質之盆　，其式樣均係摹仿所盛菜肴之實物而鑄者。</p>
<p>古羅馬之廚司技術極精，能烹一全豬，半爿烘焙，半爿燜煮。</p>
<p>按照荷蘭法律，馬肉祇准由指定的店肆出售，普通出售牛羊豬肉的店肆，不准出售。</p>
<p>羅馬在紀元前二百年時，婦女服裝的顱色，法律上有明文限制。</p>
<p>英國婦女每年絲襪所費爲九千萬元，美國婦女每年所費爲三萬五千萬元</p>
<p>紐約的地道及上升道，每年有行人近二十萬萬人。</p>
<p>英國每年製造糖果，所費爲五百萬元，所雇工人爲八萬五千。</p>
<p>汽車肇禍次數，夜間的六倍於日間。</p>
<p>照考古學家發掘所見，斷定燈與石或泥製之火把執手，爲人類鍛先製作之家庭用具。</p>
<p>一五七二年，第一隻製成之手錶，英國萊塞斯晚伯爵Earl　of　Leicester，持以進呈英后伊麗沙白。</p>
<h3>一張巴黎的戰時餐表</h3>
<p>— 江新方</p>
<p>自本年三月下旬起，巴黎市政當局對於市民每日的食物問題，已有如下的限制規例頒佈。此外，凡是當地的餐館及茶室，應接顧客的交易，一律亦須遵行。</p>
<p>禮拜一：任何肉類都不能吃到。</p>
<p>禮拜二：除了馬肉外，其他肉類皆在被限制之列。</p>
<p>禮拜三：所限的是餅類及麵食。豬肉，火腿，燒肉在今天則不加限制。</p>
<p>禮拜四：沒有强烈性酒精的飲料可以飲到。</p>
<p>禮拜五：與禮拜三相似。</p>
<p>禮拜六：一切含酒精的飲料都加限制。</p>
<p>禮拜日；唯有今日，才與戰前無異。市民可以自由聽任揀取。</p>
<p>顧今日孤島的情形，雖然各種食物的價格是高漲得足以驚人了。但是還小曾受到「限制」約束，所以我們還夠說上一句是幸福的呢；而至少對於大部份孤島上的居民這句話是應該適用的吧。</p>

<h3>母親的品格　（一）</h3>
<p>一九另八年，美國腓拉得阿腓亞省，有賈安娜小姐者，守第一次的「母親日，一紀念她的母親。她信人必因此受良好影響，故發起全國運動，遵守「母　日。」這種思想，逐漸宣陽　來。於是美國議會，乃通過一決議案，決定五月第二個主日爲母親日，時至今日這一母親日，」已成爲國際一大佳節。除基督耶穌之外，母親是上帝賜給世人的最好恩賜。我們當十分尊敬母親。我們的生命，是母親孕育成的，出世之後，哺乳，穿衣，提之携之，稍長，敎我們吃飯，識字，如有疾病，更是提心吊胆，親喂湯藥，不辭辛勞，母親的愛，眞是世上最偉，最純潔，我們是永遠感戴不忘。當耶穌要敎甽世人，上帝是怎樣照顧世人的時候，他手中拿了一朶百合花。說，「你們看這百合花，—上帝還不照顧你們嗎？」我們今日也要把一朶鮮潔的白花，作爲「母親日」的表記。白花之白，表明淸潔，白花之形，表明美麗，白花之香，表明愛心，白花生長表明仁慈，白花資質表明忠實。今試以白花爲喩，分五點討論如下（一）淸潔白花之白，表明母親的淸潔。如今有人抱獨身主義，終身不嫁，以爲自己特別淸潔，這是上帝不取的。婚姻是聖潔的，禁止嫁娶，在神經上亦認爲道德的墮落。不過，照上帝旨意成立的婚姻，如做，母親的不講母敎，濫受兒女，這樣的婚姻，亦可變爲合法的罪惡。生養孩子，只是母親的一小部份，決不能看你母職的全部。　待續　如欲詳細硏究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>教員兼推銷員</h3>
<p>— 王希堯</p>
<p>近來時常有些敎員，拿了一厚疊書籍，在上課時向學生兜售。這種兜售，美其名曰「介紹」，其實和推銷有什麼分別呢？旣和推銷的性質相同，那麽推銷員所負的使命，大抵運用其伶俐的口齒和交際手腕，把一件平常的商品說得天花亂墜，以引誘顧客而達到其賺錢的目的，那麼敎員是否應做這種推銷式的介紹？</p>
<p>所介紹的書是否値得一看？價格是否和內容相稱？我們姑且不談，單就把賣書本質來講：一位敎員拿了幾十本書進課堂，首先總得說幾句「朋友委託」，「此書內容豐富」等詞，接着便叫要買的同學簽名，於是收錢，我錢，發書，這樣至少要費一刻鐘，這一刻鐘後，能有幾人專心聽講，大郁份拿到書的學生，總要翻開來一看，這樣，嚴格地說一句，上課時把書介紹給學生買，無異是浪費時間和轉移學生的注意力。</p>
<p>原則上，筆者是絕對贊同，所不滿的方式。一個求知慾正旺盛的靑年，十分需要敎員介紹適宜的課外讀物，但所介紹的讀物的確要「名副其實」，敎員斷不可爲佣金所鼓動而不顧利害地介紹一切立意歪邪的讀物，更不可把被委托的書作盲目的介紹，還有所介紹的至少要和課本有些關　，而最正當最合理介紹的時間是在課後，或者僅由敎員開出書名，作者，出版書局而讓學生自己去購買。</p>
<h3>「薪工階級」與上海社會</h3>
<p>— 陳鑫奎</p>
<p>什麼人是上海的中堅人物呢？是電影明星嗎？不是的！是白種人嗎？更不是的！那末倒底誰是上海社會的中堅人物呢？爽快的說一句：是「薪工階級」！理由極明顯：第一是人數多，從法官，敎授，行員，店員起，到工友，茶房，廚師，餅師，老司務，小夥計等人爲止，成千成萬的勞心或勞力者，那一個不屬於「薪工階級」？第二是功勞大，靠了「薪工階級」的終日忙碌，社會上的工業，商業，學校，敎育，電信，交通，文化，出版……等一切事業，方能活動進行，舉凡消息的傳播，市塲的賣買，車輛的交通，連富人的享福在內，那一件非「薪工階級」勞動的果實？第三是負擔重，幾乎每一個職工，都有一份家庭重擔，不是上有垂垂暮年的高堂，便是十有嗷嗷待哺的妻兒，賴他們各個人省吃儉用的結果，數十百萬的老弱婦孺，才得存活在這個人世間。第四是生活苦，除少數的高級職員外，最大多數的薪給生活者，無不異常淸苦，在物價的重壓下，他們早一談不到豐衣足食，更無所謂娛樂享受，他們所有的祇是一天到晚，一年到頭的埋頭苦幹。不論雨雪風霜，嚴寒酷暑，都須照常「上班」，「脫班」要受處分，「生病」要扣工錢。正像螞蟻蜜蜂一般的勤勞，同樣也像螞蟻蜜蜂一般的微賤，老了病了死了，默默的從這個世界上消逝，再不留半點兒影踪。但是，說也慚愧，像道樣有職業而又肯吃苦耐勞的人們，據說就稱爲國家的善良公民，社會的安寗，人羣的進化，全是他們所維持而推動的哩！</p>
<p>大家喊著購實力薄弱，上海灘要坍下去了。誰的購買力最弱呢？還不是月進有限的「薪工階級」麽？誰在苦撑着不使上海的市面不坍下去呢？不也是「薪工階級」麼？因此，當「薪工階級」爲生活而不得不要求津貼的現在，有資力的一方，若再不與以同情和接納，則「薪工階級」這條最後提防一破，上海的市場，還保得住不崩潰嗎？</p>

<h3>Major Victory for Chinese Forces on the Henan-Hubei Border: Japanese Army Collapses Across the Board, Suffering Nighttime Rout. A Day and Night of Fierce Fighting Results in 20,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Over 60 Tanks and 50 Artillery Pieces Captured.</h3>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese forces entrenched in their last positions on the Henan-Hubei border suffered continuous encirclement and annihilation by Chinese forces yesterday afternoon, resulting in exceptionally fierce fighting. Flush with successive victories, the Chinese army, with the spirit to swallow rivers and mountains, launched an all-out offensive from all directions simultaneously, directly penetrating the Japanese lines and engaging in a sweeping slaughter. Japanese soldiers lay dead within the trenches, which were leveled. By dusk, the entire Japanese front had collapsed, resulting in a nighttime rout of countless disordered troops. The chaos and utter disarray were unprecedented since the start of the war. Starting last night, the battle entered a stage of vigorous pursuit. A brief account follows: (1) The remnants of the defeated Japanese forces from northwest Zhaoyang retreated southward in three batches on the night of the eleventh. The first batch crossed the Xiangzao Road at Shuanggou that night and retreated to the vicinity of Huanglongdang. This morning, they were encircled and annihilated by Chinese forces in a single stroke. After fierce fighting until noon, they were completely wiped out. The second batch, numbering over two thousand, retreated to the southeast area of Shuanggou. This morning, they were intercepted and annihilated by the Chinese, with over half of them killed. Japanese officers abandoned their corpses completely and attempted to break through and retreat south, but were again overtaken and severely routed by Chinese forces. By this afternoon, they had been completely wiped out. The third batch also retreated to the vicinity of Shuanggou late on the eleventh, unaware that Shuanggou had already been recaptured by Chinese forces. They were caught in a sudden and severe attack by the Chinese army, resulting in countless Japanese killed and many captured alive. (2) The remnants of the Japanese army that retreated overnight to Cangtai Town from southern Henan were fiercely attacked by Chinese forces from three sides. The Japanese troops immediately collapsed in disarray and retreated further southeast, abandoning weapons, ammunition, and corpses all over the ground, having lost all ability to resist. The Chinese forces are currently pursuing and blocking them from different directions, and a complete annihilation is expected tonight. (3) The remnants of the Japanese army west of Zhaoyang retreated toward Zhongxiang overnight, but have been intercepted by Chinese forces in the Xiang River east bank area opposite Yicheng and are being encircled and annihilated. These Japanese troops have no chance of escape. (4) The remnants of the Japanese army, numbering over four thousand, that retreated to the southeast area of Biyang from southern Henan attempted to retreat back to Xinyang, but were encircled and attacked by Chinese forces yesterday, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. Japanese corpses lay in countless numbers, and discarded weapons were scattered all over the ground. They turned and fled toward Tongbai, and the Chinese army immediately gave chase. Chinese units near Tongbai also launched a head-on interception, attacking from both front and rear. These Japanese forces were immediately routed, and a small number of remnants scattered and hid in the mountains, currently being cleared out by a certain unit. In addition, scattered Japanese stragglers in the vast area are being intercepted by Chinese forces everywhere, leading to a dead end. Over sixty such groups have been captured and eliminated by Chinese forces. According to the battle reports flying in like snowflakes from the battlefield after noon on the twelfth, the results of the battle from yesterday noon to this evening include the annihilation of approximately 20,000 Japanese soldiers, the capture of sixty-four tanks, three hundred and twenty-three vehicles, fifty-two artillery pieces of various types, over two thousand five hundred horses, and countless other weapons and ammunition. (Twelfth dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: A batch of Japanese soldiers captured alive by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Zhaoyang on the tenth, including Nakamura no Yu and Yoshifuku Shiro, witnessed the tragic defeat of the Japanese army and were filled with grief. On the eleventh, they jointly issued a letter of surrender, requesting the Chinese army to forward it to the Japanese troops currently in retreat. (Twelfth dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Since the ninth, the Chinese army on the Xianghua Road has launched a fierce offensive against the Japanese army, successively capturing over ten important strongholds on the periphery of Suixian, including Junchuan, Anju, Huantan, and Maping. They immediately shifted southward and continued their advance toward Japanese positions in the Anlu and Yingshan areas, achieving rapid progress. Furthermore, one of the reasons for the encirclement and annihilation of the main force of the Japanese army this time was the inability to resupply them with provisions and ammunition, leading to the loss of their overall combat power. The Japanese rear echelon, at the risk of their lives, transported a large amount of supplies yesterday and today, hoping to provide a final lifeline. Yesterday, a large column of over two thousand Japanese donkey and horse-drawn carts, accompanied by infantry, artillery, and tanks, advanced northward from Zhongshen. They were ambushed by the Chinese army near Changshou Shop in the muddy terrain and engaged in fierce encirclement battles until this noon. Except for a portion destroyed, the remainder was completely captured by the Chinese army. In addition, numerous new-type Japanese aircraft have continuously flown over the battlefield in recent days, dropping provisions and ammunition, most of which have been seized by the Chinese army and civilians. (Twelfth dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from the Hubei front, the Chinese army, based in Zhaoyang, launched a counteroffensive against the first line of the Japanese army yesterday afternoon. It is reported that after fierce fighting, the Chinese army has recaptured Biangou on the Fanzao Highway and cleared out the remaining Japanese forces in the area. The Chinese side claims that the Japanese army suffered 15,000 casualties in the Zhaoyang area. (Twelfth dispatch from the United Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military authorities here claim that the Chinese army has defeated 150,000 Japanese soldiers in the largest battle in the Far East since the fall of Wuhan two years ago. According to telegrams, the seven divisions of the Japanese army advancing on the plains east of Xiangyang have fallen into a trap set by the Chinese. The Chinese army has launched a general counteroffensive, recapturing various important positions and killing over 13,000 Japanese soldiers. (Twelfth dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Luoyang: In recent days, the Chinese army in southern Henan has pursued the defeated Japanese forces, achieving significant victories. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers retreating from eastern Biyang were surrounded by the Chinese. The Chinese army on the Pinghan Railway has now approached Changtaiguan, and new developments are expected within days. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese forces retreating along different routes in southern Henan and northern Hubei continued their retreat southeast on the eleventh under the relentless pursuit and interception by the various Chinese armies. Only a small portion of the Japanese remnants retreating from Biyang toward Xinyang managed to escape. A portion is still surrounded by the Chinese in the area between Biyang, Tongbai, and Pingkenguan. The Chinese pursuit forces advanced to the outskirts of Xinyang on the eleventh and have made contact with the attacking units from all sides. The Japanese army in Xinyang is extremely panicked because the Pinghan Railway has been completely destroyed by the Chinese and they are also under siege by the Chinese. They have only received reinforcements of over a thousand men from the Yingshan area, attempting a last-ditch struggle. The Japanese forces retreating southward from Tanghe and Xinye were attacked by the Chinese near Zhaoyang, suffering heavy casualties. Over four hundred Japanese soldiers covering the retreat at Biangou were also ambushed by the Chinese and retreated eastward in disarray. Shuanggou has been recaptured by the Chinese. The Chinese army also launched a fierce offensive against the rear of the Japanese army south of Changshou Shop and launched a large-scale pursuit in the areas of ·Shan Huanglong · · Hucheng · · Qiaozhen. The Chinese army on the Nanghua Road further attacked from the northwest and both sides, cutting off the Japanese retreat route. Currently, the large armies of the Chinese army pursuing and converging from various routes are compressing the encirclement and vigorously annihilating the remaining Japanese forces. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi: The Japanese forces defeated near Biangou mostly retreated to the southwest area of Zhaoyang, where they are being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese. A portion retreated southward, pursued by Chinese forces along separate routes. They were ambushed near Liushuigou and Tianjiaji by Chinese pursuers. The Chinese launched a fierce pincer attack, engaging in combat for three hours, killing over five hundred Japanese soldiers, including one high-ranking Japanese officer. The remaining Japanese soldiers broke through and retreated southward, with Japanese reinforcements launching a counterattack. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese. (Twelfth dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: On the eighth, a certain unit of the Chinese army ambushed the Japanese forces retreating from Yuxinhe toward Tiandou near the west of Tiandou on the Yuxinhe, killing over three hundred Japanese soldiers, destroying many Japanese trucks, and capturing many light and heavy machine guns and rifles. The Japanese forces retreated in disarray, and the Chinese forces are currently advancing toward a certain location. (Twelfth dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: In southern Henan and northern Hubei, in addition to capturing countless Japanese soldiers along the way, the various Chinese pursuit units have captured over forty Japanese tanks south of Biyang. Over a hundred warhorses have been captured on the Tangzao Road. In other areas as well, a large amount of war loot has been obtained and is currently being inventoried. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces in Southern Shanxi Search for Remnants of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The Chinese army in southern Shanxi is actively searching for remnants of the Japanese army.

At Chenshi (between 7am-9am) on the eighth, the Chinese army recaptured Fudian Town (east of Qinshui). Over three hundred Japanese soldiers were completely annihilated by the Chinese. On the same day, the Japanese army in Wangzhai Town and Qinglonggou were also subjected to a large-scale offensive by the Chinese, resulting in over five hundred Japanese casualties, the destruction of seven Japanese vehicles, and the capture of many military supplies.

<h3>Japanese Army near Guangji Attempts Invasion, Fails to Succeed</h3>
<p>Shashi: Since May 2, the Chinese army in eastern Hubei has launched an offensive toward Qichun and Tianjiatie, sweeping away almost all the Japanese forces scattered outside the strongholds. The remnants of the Japanese army, filled with fear, gathered over one thousand eight hundred troops in recent days, with aircraft providing cover, and invaded Dajinpu (south of Guangji) again, attempting to relieve their precarious situation. The Chinese army shifted its offensive eastward, flanking the Japanese forces. At the same time, large forces were mobilized from Wuzushan northeast of Huangmei and Shuangchengyi (east of Guangji) to launch a pincer attack. At noon on the tenth, the Japanese forces retreated in disarray upon hearing the news. The Chinese forces are currently advancing along separate routes toward Japanese-held strongholds along the Yangtze River upstream and downstream of Wuxue. (Twelfth dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Victory of Common Sense and Reason</h3>
<p>Since the Allied Anglo-French forces were forced to withdraw from central Norway, there was a moment of crisis and shock. The world's attention was focused on the movements of Italy, as the pressure in Southeast Europe and the Mediterranean was at its lowest. Before the British Parliament's debate could conclude, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the tiny state of Luxembourg suffered the same fate as Denmark and Norway, becoming victims of collateral damage. The war in Western Europe, which had been dormant for over half a year, suddenly flared up again. The insatiable desire for aggression is in full swing, and humanity's calamity has not yet subsided. When weighing the fate of the world, one cannot help but feel deep sorrow!</p>
<p>Although this European war began in early September of last year, both sides have been cautious and hesitant. The resources spent on diplomatic warfare, economic warfare, and so-called psychological warfare have far exceeded those spent on formal combat on the front lines. As late as the beginning of last month, Germany suddenly used blitzkrieg tactics to invade Denmark and Norway in order to seize a strategic advantage, marking the prelude to the main force's imminent clash. Now that Germany does not hesitate to once again act unjustly, using Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg as a passageway to regain the offensive, the decisive battle between the main forces of both sides is approaching. The hope that the European war could be avoided from expanding has been completely dashed. If the spread of war can lead to a swift and decisive victory, it would be better than letting it drag on, causing the whole world to suffer the pain of chronic devastation. However, recent events have been sudden and elusive, giving people a sense of being overwhelmed. However, if we analyze them carefully, we can see that various issues, such as the development of the European war, the reorganization of the British cabinet, and the current situation in India and the Dutch East Indies, can all be seen as the victory of common sense and reason. I will now briefly share my views on these three aspects.</p>
<p>The extension of the European war to Belgium and the Netherlands is certainly unfortunate for those countries and their people. However, the war has remained confined to the lower Rhine and the North Sea coast, which is fortunate compared to a situation where it spreads in all directions without end. The situation in the Mediterranean was unprecedentedly tense a few numbers of days ago. In reality, Italy has not changed its posture of pulling back its bow in defense. Germany's failure to shift its military focus to the weaker and more complex situation in Southeast Europe, but instead following the failed path of Europe's past, is a matter worthy of deep reflection. Although it cannot be immediately concluded that coordination between Germany and Italy is insufficient, to a minimum level, Germany's operations, despite reaching a critical juncture, have not yet been able to obtain a response or assistance from its only allied nation, which must be regarded as one of Germany's failures. While Germany may have a valid reason for taking the offensive despite the wrongdoing, it also exposes its anxious and impatient predicament. The annexation of Austria, the seizure of Czechoslovakia, and the invasion of Poland in the past all had a valid justification in politics, and they were able to choose the most opportune moment in the international arena. But recently, they have disregarded everything, made no choices, and acted recklessly, like a matter of ease. The stimulus it has given to the world is hardly comparable to previous atrocities. While its fierceness is alarming, its weaknesses are also fully revealed. With its sharp edges fully exposed and making enemies on all sides, Nazi Germany today has embarked on the most dangerous path.</p>
<p>Looking at the change of the British cabinet: Chamberlain has been at the forefront of major international changes over the years. His efforts to cope with these events cannot be denied. However, he cannot escape responsibility for the tragedy of today's great war. Among his cabinet members, Simon was the culprit of defending Japan after the September 18th Incident, and Hoare also acted to accommodate the aggressors during the East African campaign. Tracing back to the root, they must all be considered indirectly responsible for this war. In recent days, the condemnation of the cabinet in both houses of the British Parliament has been directed at these two in particular. Although it is not yet time to settle historical merits and demerits, the resignation of the three can be seen as a sign of a clearer and brighter British policy. The succession of Churchill as Prime Minister and the participation of Labour Party members in the government give people a refreshing feeling. Britain's current situation is unprecedentedly difficult, so we should not have excessive expectations of the new cabinet. However, its position against aggression and non-compromise will undoubtedly be firmer than the previous cabinet, and its domestic and foreign policies will also become more enlightened, aligning with the expectations of the world.</p>
<p>The situation in the Dutch East Indies is undoubtedly becoming more serious at this time, when the Netherlands is suffering a terrible disaster. While Britain and France cannot fully protect the security of the Far East, the United States has resolutely taken on this heavy burden. Hull's statements have repeatedly expressed his firm attitude, and he has kept a strong fleet stationed in Hawaii to maintain control with force. Even if the Japanese warlords' ambition is strong, they must know when to stop. If they overestimate their capabilities and act recklessly, it would be no different from using their nearly depleted national strength as a gamble to hasten their own defeat. Judging from recent events, the United States is more concerned about the situation in the Far East than about the events in Europe. The United States will absolutely not tolerate the threat to the peace and security of the Pacific, which is something that those who care about the fate of the Far East should find deeply comforting.</p>
<p>Worldly affairs are interwoven with misfortune and fortune, and extremes must turn. The progress of history is also like this. For ten years, the international political situation has increasingly added to its dark side, reaching its peak in recent times. Therefore, the events that have occurred in recent days, which can be seen as a clear sign of the victory of common sense and reason, can be regarded as the beginning of the shift in the world's political fortune from decline to prosperity. The unprecedented defeat of the invading Japanese army in recent days is a fit representation of the last inevitable fate of the aggressor. The fact that the evolution of world affairs is in line with the expectations and predictions of the world shows that the greatest authority among people today still belongs to justice and fairness. There is no need to feel panic because of the extraordinary changes in the international situation and the widespread flooding of local wars.</p>

<h3>Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation - May 5th to May 11th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman of the Military Commission said that the battle situation of the week (May 5 to May 11) was most intense in the Henan-Hubei border area. The Chinese army, according to its predetermined plan, carried out an encirclement and annihilation battle against the large-scale harassing Japanese army, completely defeating the main force of the Japanese army in central China and creating an unprecedented victory. In other battlefronts, the Chinese army also had the upper hand and made great progress. The summary of the battle progress is as follows:</p>
<p>Southern Henan, Northern Hubei, Central Hubei</p>
<p>More than 100,000 Japanese troops, accompanied by powerful artillery cavalry and tank troops, and a large number of air force assisted in the battle, vainly hoped to use an encirclement formation to break through the main force of the Chinese army and occupy the area between the east bank of the Xiang River and the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. Since last week, they launched an offensive on three fronts. (1) In southern Henan, they divided into two routes. The first route advanced along the Quenan Highway from Changtaiguan to Biyang on the 1st. The second route invaded Tongbai along the Xinnan Highway, and their momentum was quite rampant. Starting on the 6th, the Chinese army divided into routes and advanced eastward, completing the outer wing encirclement. At the same time, the Chinese troops guarding Tongbai were never taken in for what they are worth, so that the two Japanese troops were in a state of separation. Starting on the 7th, they began to counterattack the Japanese army, capturing Tanghe and Liulin on the 8th, Minggang on the 9th, and Biyang on the 10th, and defeating the Japanese who broke through. The remnant Japanese army was defeated. (2) In northern Hubei, the Japanese invaded from Suixian in three routes on the morning of the 4th, reaching the line of Gaocheng, Lishan, and Anju on the 5th. The Chinese army on this front, on one hand, fought with the Japanese army, on the other hand, mobilized the main force, and used surprise tactics to leap forward to the rear of the Japanese army on the Xianghua Road. On the 8th, the Japanese again attacked Tangxian and Mengtan Towns with all their strength. After fierce fighting until late at night, the Chinese army immediately joined forces with the surprise troops and the Dahongshan troops, and completed a heavy encirclement behind the Japanese army. On the 9th and 10th, the Japanese army retreating to the north was fiercely besieged by the Chinese army in the area between Zhaoyang and Tongbai, and suffered extremely heavy casualties. The remnant Japanese army was unable to break through. (3) In central Hubei, the Japanese army in Zhongxiang Yangzi began to invade on the 2nd. On that day, they were continuously attacked by the Chinese army in the Changshou Shop, Zhangjiaji, Liushuigou, and Tianjiaji areas, resulting in more than half of the Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. They retreated northward, and a part of them crossed the Gun River and the Xiangzao Highway and retreated to Shuangsha, where they were defeated by the Chinese army in the area between Xinye Bao and Fancheng. On the 9th, the Japanese army defeated by the Chinese army near Xinye retreated to the southeast, and was again severely attacked by the Chinese army in the area west of Zhaoyang and northeast of Fancheng, killing more than 13,000 Japanese soldiers. In total, after ten days of bloody battles on all fronts, the Japanese army suffered more than 35,000 casualties. The Chinese troops advancing southward are now doing their best to strike at the Japanese troops who are deeply surrounded. At the same time, the large armies of the Chinese army have repeatedly attacked almost all the important strongholds behind the Japanese army on the southern section of Pinghan Railway and the Quenan, Xinnan, Xianghua, and Jingzhong Highways, thoroughly cutting off the Japanese army's retreat route. The remnant Japanese army, wandering in the Henan-Hubei border area and within the Chinese army's encirclement, is bound to be annihilated. The Chinese army's most thorough victory before the tenth day is about to be completed.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi The Japanese army that invaded Zhongtiao Mountain has been repeatedly encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army for two weeks, killing 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese soldiers. Many important Japanese generals, such as Regiment Commander Shigematsu and Battalion Commander Morimoto, were killed. Currently, the Japanese officers and soldiers have completely lost their fighting spirit. The war outside Jinan, Southeast Jin, is extremely fierce. The Japanese army is trapped in isolated cities and unable to move. The Japanese army surrounded by Chinese forces north of Gaoping Pass and southwest of Yangcheng has been continuously attacked by the Chinese army for weeks, beheading and capturing thousands of them, and taking advantage of the victory to capture Dongfeng and Zhangcun and other strongholds, and fiercely pursuing the defeated Japanese army. At the same time, the large armies of the Chinese army in southwestern Shanxi took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce offensive against the rear of the Japanese army, and successively attacked Linjin, Hejin, Jishan, Fencheng, forced to Xin Feng, and recovered important strongholds such as Xihouma and Houma Station. The sweeping battle is in full swing.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui After the Chinese army captured many strongholds such as Nanling, Huangqiao, and Lingyang, it advanced fiercely in multiple directions for days. One route first captured Chishatan north of Fanchang City and Jiulang Temple on the morning of the 5th, and another main force forced its way to the south of the city, attacking from both sides and annihilating countless Japanese troops. The Japanese army in the city showed signs of wavering and broke through and retreated in droves. The county seat was completely recovered on the night of the 9th. One route reached the outskirts of Qingyang City on the afternoon of the 6th, tightly surrounding the remaining Japanese army and launching a heroic siege. On the 7th, they rushed into the city and fought the Japanese army in the streets. Most of the Japanese army was annihilated, and the rest broke through and retreated in all directions. Qingyang County was completely declared recovered. Starting on the 8th, the Chinese army in both routes continued to advance in a multi-pronged and converging manner, threatening Wuhu, and the Japanese army was extremely panicked.</p>
<p>In addition, (1) The Japanese army invading the mountainous area south of Feixian in southern Shandong was completely defeated by the Chinese army, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army in eastern Shandong has launched a fierce attack on Anqiu for days, capturing a lot. (2) The Chinese army in northern Jiangxi captured Anyi on the morning of the 7th, and another force attacked Tujiapu, cutting off the Nanchang-Xun Highway traffic. (3) The Chinese army in northern Hunan forced its way to Linxiang, and rushed into Yanglousi, burning many Japanese barracks and warehouses. (4) The Chinese forces on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway side in Jiangnan killed more than 500 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army in eastern Zhejiang broke into Dinghai County and annihilated the stubborn Japanese army. (5) The various Chinese troops attacking the Japanese army in southern Guangxi successively captured Songcun, Yangmei, Shibu, Takou and other strongholds west of Nanning. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. These are all important battle achievements of this week. (Eleventh dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Northern Henan Attacks Anyang</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The Chinese army in northern Henan attacked Anyang on the evening of the 6th with careful planning. On the night of the 7th, they arrived at Niangniang Temple (south of Anyang). A part of them attacked Anyang City and the station, and a part of them destroyed the nearby traffic, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. A railway bridge 20 miles south of the city was blown up by the Chinese, and several miles of the Anshui Highway were destroyed, and more than 500 catties of telegraph wire were obtained.

<h3>Great Fire in Tokyo Destroys 500 Houses, Burning 20 People to Death</h3>

<h3>Construction of Central Hospital Bombed, Tragic Scene, Memorial Service Held Yesterday for Martyrs</h3>
<p>Guiyang, June 1st. Eight Japanese planes flew over Guiyang, circling above the Central Hospital and dropping multiple bombs in the vicinity. Two bombs hit the hospital, instantly killing the head nurse on duty, Wang Qinghua, nurse Chong Yizhen, and two others, a tragic sight. Several on-duty student assistants were seriously injured. A memorial service for the martyred nurses was scheduled for the 12th. Today, the reporter paid respects at the hospital to the nurses who sacrificed themselves for the country and interviewed Dr. Shen Kefei, the hospital director, to inquire about his feelings. Shen said that after the central government announced his appointment as Deputy Director of the Department of Health, he left Guiyang for Chongqing on April 30th. On the 1st, he arrived in Qijiang and received a telegram from Guiyang stating that the hospital had been bombed. He immediately returned to Guiyang and saw the collapsed buildings, the dismembered bodies of the dead, and the injured moaning in their beds, which filled him with grief. The Japanese have repeatedly targeted charitable and cultural institutions for bombing. The facts of the past three years have made this clear, and it is not surprising. Our hospital was bombed in Nanjing on September 25, 1937. Unexpectedly, after moving to Guiyang, the Japanese have not forgotten us. The current losses include the complete destruction of the warehouse, dining hall, maternity room, and operating room. Several wards were partially collapsed. The head nurse and three others were killed, and several were injured. However, thanks to the efforts of the doctors, staff, workers, and friends in the hospital, none of the 200 or so inpatients were killed or injured. Moreover, after the bombing, the hospital continued to rescue the wounded, clear debris, and resume outpatient services on the same day, without interruption. This shows that although the Japanese can destroy our material possessions and bodies, they can never affect our spirit. After two tragic bombings by the Japanese, I feel an even greater sense of responsibility. In the future, I am determined to work even harder with this understanding. Furthermore, after the hospital was bombed, we received numerous condolences from all sides, and Mr. Li Rui from Chongqing, through intermediaries, donated 5,000 yuan, enabling the hospital to start repairs as soon as possible, which is especially inspiring.

<h3>Chinese Side Hopes New British Government Will Improve Sino-British Relations, Recognizes Churchill as a Friend of China</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The news of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's resignation has been welcomed by all sectors of Chinese society, who hope that the new government under the leadership of Churchill will improve Sino-British relations. Chinese figures recognize Churchill as a person with proactive policies and as a friend of China during the Sino-Japanese War. Chinese figures also anticipate the possibility of Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's dismissal. As far as the Chinese are concerned, the most detested figure among the British government's key members is Simon, because they believe that Simon was the one who rejected the joint Anglo-American intervention proposed by the US Secretary of State during the Manchurian Incident in 1931, and that Simon was also the one who obstructed the proposal for a British monetary loan to China in 1938. The general Chinese public believes that as long as Chamberlain and Simon are in office, there is no hope for Britain to adopt a proactive policy in the Far East. The Chinese recall Churchill's conversation with Sun Ke in London last year, when Churchill assured Sun Ke of Britain's sympathy and friendship towards China. The Central Daily News commented today on the British cabinet, stating that Churchill has always paid close attention to Far Eastern affairs. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Churchill repeatedly published articles in newspapers denouncing Japan's aggression. He is a sympathetic friend of China who has provided valuable moral encouragement to the Chinese resistance. Now that Churchill has been chosen as Prime Minister, we congratulate Britain and the world. The British government naturally has its own fundamental policies in diplomacy, which will not change with the establishment of a new government. However, the implementation of these policies depends on the new government. We hope that the civilized people of the world will, with the reorganization of the British government, rise up and unite to restore peace and order in the world and seek a reasonable solution to various disputes. Since the September 18th Incident, Chinese figures have consistently expressed dissatisfaction with the "policy of compromise" under the leadership of Baldwin and Chamberlain. In recent months, Chinese figures have become increasingly concerned about Britain's Far Eastern policy due to the understanding reached last year between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, the recent British proposal regarding the settlement of the Tianjin silver issue, and Ambassador Craigie's speech at a luncheon of the British-Japanese Association in Tokyo. The comments made by certain British figures that Britain must concentrate all its efforts and resources on the European war and cannot afford to have further disputes with Japan in the Far East are seen by the Chinese as an ominous sign. Observing that Chinese newspapers almost exclusively published British news during the initial stages of the European war, which resulted in dissatisfaction from Germany and the Soviet Union, the adoption of British news by newspapers has gradually decreased, which shows a lack of trust in British friendship. In the past few months, the number of American news agency dispatches adopted by Chinese newspapers has been increasing. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>German Forces Forcibly Cross the Albert Canal, Encounter Fierce Resistance in Belgium, British and French Air Forces Assist Belgian and Dutch Forces in Combat, Belgian Foreign Minister Declares Military Situation Stable</h3>
<p>Paris. According to responsible sources, German forces in Belgium have already crossed the Albert Canal, and Belgian forces are retreating. The Albert Canal starts from Liège and ends at the port of Antwerp. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris. The General Headquarters has just issued Communiqué No. 499, stating that German forces in Belgium launched a fierce attack on Belgian forces in the area of the Albert Canal and the Meuse River this morning. Our air force immediately dispatched a large number of aircraft to assist Belgian forces in combat, which was very effective. Our bomber squadrons bombed enemy columns and important bridges yesterday evening and shot down eight enemy aircraft. They continued to operate actively until late at night. The results are still unknown. Our troops are continuing to advance according to the planned schedule. German artillery has been continuously bombarding our positions between the Saar River and the foothills of the Vosges Mountains. Contact was made in certain locations last night. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels. Foreign Minister Spaak recently stated to newspaper reporters that although the current situation is serious, our troops are fighting bravely, and the Allied assistance is very effective. The military situation stabilized last night. Although German forces have made some progress in certain locations, our troops will not find it difficult to repel them. Our government does not intend to move elsewhere. All citizens should remain calm and not be swayed by malicious propaganda. In addition, Prime Minister Pierlot is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech at 6 pm this month to explain the current situation. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris. Since yesterday, large-scale skirmishes have occurred on the front lines, and their scope has gradually expanded. A description follows: (1) German forces in Belgium launched a major offensive on both the north and south sides of Liège yesterday. Those on the north side took the route through the Dutch province of Limburg and attacked the city of Tongeren in eastern Belgium. They occupied Maastricht in the Netherlands yesterday and forcibly crossed the Albert Canal. Those on the south side, in the area of the Ardennes Mountains, crossed the Belgian province of Luxembourg and launched a fierce attack on Neufchâteau. Belgian forces have already begun to retreat. According to military sources here, the fighting in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg is still in the initial stages of contact. The British and French Allied forces have dispatched a large number of troops to assist in the fighting within the past 24 hours, according to the planned schedule, and will establish contact with the Belgian and Dutch forces within 36 hours. This result is very important. In addition, the British and French air forces repeatedly engaged the German air force in Belgium and bombed German military targets and troop formations in the area of Maastricht in the southern Netherlands. A total of 36 German aircraft were shot down yesterday. (2) The fighting in Luxembourg was quiet yesterday, presumably due to the heavy losses suffered by the German forces. The bodies of German soldiers are scattered everywhere in front of the French positions, which is clear evidence. (3) In the area of the Maginot Line, where the front line stretches for more than 60 kilometers, a German division on the west bank of the Moselle River launched an offensive. Although it was successful for a time, it was still repelled by the French forces. German forces on the Lorraine front heavily bombarded French positions between Faulbach and the foothills of the Vosges Mountains this morning, but repeated attacks were unsuccessful. Those on both banks of the Saar River also launched offensives north of Faulbach, Saarguemines, and the Bitsch area. The German forces are launching separate attacks in this area. It is still difficult to say whether their intention is to constrain the French troops or whether it is a prelude to a major battle or a general offensive. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>German Military Headquarters Communiqué States Capture of Dutch Fortress Fort</p>
<p>Berlin. The German Military Headquarters announced that Fort Eben-Emael of the Liège Fortress in the Netherlands, a strategically important location controlling both the Meuse and Albert Canals, was captured by German forces yesterday afternoon. In addition to capturing more than a thousand enemy soldiers, the commander of the fort was also captured by German forces. (12th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. The German High Command issued a battle report at noon today, stating that the entire territory of Luxembourg is now in our army's hands. The army, with the cooperation of the air force, continues to advance. Our army has occupied the province of Groningen in northern Netherlands and is approaching the east coast of the Zuiderzee. The Grebbe Line from Amersfoort to Rhenen has been broken through by our army and is continuing to advance westward. The Albert Canal has been crossed from Asselt to Maastricht. Fort Eben-Emael in the Liège defense area was captured by our army earlier. Important strongholds near Liège have also been broken through by our army. At the same time, our army is also making rapid progress in southern Belgium. Our air force continued to bomb in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands yesterday, destroying many airfields, docks, and ammunition depots. The Haaksbergen airfield, with 30 aircraft stationed, and the Orléans airfield, with 36 aircraft stationed, were also destroyed. A total of 64 enemy aircraft were shot down. (12th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. A German war correspondent published an article in a local newspaper yesterday, describing the difficulties encountered by the German forces in crossing the Meuse River. According to the report, German forces crossed into the Netherlands at 5:35 AM on the 10th, and the vanguard immediately encountered fire from the enemy's right wing, thus commencing the war. All roads were blocked, with trees lying across the path and obstacles made of reinforced concrete. However, this was not enough to stop our army's advance. All the bridges along the way were also blown up, and the iron bridge over the Meuse River was also destroyed, forcing the German forces to rely on engineers to cross the Meuse River. As the engineers were setting up the crossing, enemy gunfire suddenly erupted. Our army used armored vehicles and artillery to cover the engineers as they worked. Within two hours, we destroyed seventeen important enemy strongholds, and the enemy's gunfire gradually subsided. Then, reconnaissance teams crossed the river first, followed by infantry, engineers, and bicycle teams. Upstream, there was a small town. Although the doors and windows of the houses in the town were shattered, most of the residents were calm and able to show understanding to the German forces. (12th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. The German Military Headquarters issued a supplementary battle report to the Haitong News Agency yesterday, stating that Germany's advance into the Netherlands and Belgium is aimed at protecting the neutrality of the two countries. Britain and France assumed that Germany would wait until the Allied forces occupied and attacked German positions before taking action. This hope has now failed. Enemy generals thought that the Dutch and Belgian armies would be able to stop the German advance westward, and the British and French armies could proceed with deliberation. This is also a disappointment. The German soldiers hope that Britain will understand that the decisive battle has now begun, after several months, and that the Head of State awarded the Iron Cross to two meritorious officers on the first day, which also indicated its significance. Our army is now advancing westward. All details will be announced after certain objectives have been achieved. (12th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to German war correspondent Li Qicha, German forces entered the town of Maastricht yesterday morning. The town has a population of 70,000. (12th Haitong dispatch)</p>

(3) Our positions in the area of Liège remain steadfast, and several fortresses have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy forces. (4) Enemy aircraft are still very active and have flown to various parts of our country, indiscriminately bombing. (11th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels. The Belgian General Headquarters issued a communiqué at noon today, stating that our troops are now proceeding step by step according to the planned schedule, holding their positions and offering resolute resistance to the invaders. Although enemy forces have seized footholds on our defense line, they have not made any significant progress. Their paratroopers have landed in several locations in our country and have been annihilated. Several of their aircraft have been shot down by our side. The German forces once made progress in the Hasselt area yesterday, but the Belgian forces quickly launched a counterattack with entire divisions. Fearing being cut off from their base, the German forces retreated towards the city of Hasselt. Large-scale fighting is underway. According to the latest news, after German forces crossed the Albert Canal, Belgian forces began a counterattack this morning. After several hours of fierce fighting, they have gained the upper hand and have repelled the German forces in various locations in the province of Limburg. The Allied forces of Britain and France assisted in the operation. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris. The General Headquarters has just issued battle report number 498: "After our troops crossed the border and entered Belgian territory, they are now continuing to advance. The Allied forces are advancing very rapidly with the assistance of our advance units. In addition, enemy forces are continuing to launch fierce attacks, and a large number of soldiers have landed in the Netherlands, either from aircraft or by parachute. The Dutch army, with the assistance of the British air force, is now encircling and suppressing them. The enemy forces in Luxembourg have suffered heavy losses. Those on the east bank of the Moselle River, although still launching fierce attacks, have suffered setbacks. There is nothing to report between the Moselle River and the Swiss border. Enemy aircraft again flew over our country today to bomb various cities, with minimal losses. Our air force also took retaliatory measures, flying to Germany to bomb various airfields and important military targets. A total of 36 enemy aircraft were shot down in our country and Belgium today by the air forces of Britain and France. One of our fighter squadrons shot down 11 enemy aircraft yesterday and 5 at Murd.

<p>Berlin. German troops arrived yesterday at Mamelis, which was originally German territory but was ceded to Belgium after the Treaty of Versailles. (12th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Dutch Forces Encircle and Suppress Paratroopers, Regain Ability to Control the Situation</p>
<p>Paris. After German troops invaded the Netherlands, they have not been able to cross the line of the IJssel River. Although the city of Arnhem has been occupied, the German advance has been blocked by the Dutch army. In other areas, only a small number of troops have invaded Dutch positions. Realizing that a frontal offensive is not easy to achieve, the German forces are now planning to make maximum use of paratroopers. Yesterday, such troops were dropped in batches. The first batch was dropped in the morning and was encircled and suppressed by the Dutch army. The fighting lasted until dusk before they were annihilated. However, before long, another large number of paratroopers jumped down. The Dutch army immediately launched a fierce attack on them. In certain areas, the German paratroopers were able to form units of 1,000 men each. However, by 10 AM this morning, the Dutch army was able to control the overall situation. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague. Local volunteer police have assisted the military police this week in clearing out the "Fifth Column" (i.e., spies) in the Netherlands, arresting hundreds of suspects. A Reuters correspondent witnessed a building surrounded by armed police, with several people climbing onto the roof. One person was shot and killed after they were discovered sending signals to enemy aircraft. All important buildings are now guarded, and anyone entering without proof of identity is arrested. This plan appears to be quite effective, preventing saboteurs from carrying out malicious acts. Domestic mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means of communication have been completely shut down, making it even more difficult for saboteurs to act. There was some street fighting in Amsterdam, but the authorities appear to be in control of the situation. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague. The Dutch General Staff announced last night that British and French troops have joined the Dutch army in combat, and the German advance has been halted. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague. The city center was bombed by German aircraft this morning. Two buildings were destroyed, and the number of people killed is not yet known. Approximately 30 people were injured. More than half of the officers and soldiers carried by a German armored train were annihilated by the Dutch army near the city of Meijel. Furthermore, German forces attacking the city of Waalhaven have been repelled. Two formations of German aircraft, one with seventeen aircraft and the other with five, flew west over the city of Waalwijk at an altitude of two to three thousand meters. In addition, the Aviation Department announced that five German transport aircraft had flown over the city of Tiel, mainly transporting ammunition by parachute. As for the enemy paratroopers landing in our country, their numbers had increased by the evening, especially in the areas of Notter and Tiel. (11th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels. Last night, hundreds of German soldiers descended by parachute in the suburbs of Brussels. It is reported that none of them remain a threat. These paratroopers are now carrying dummies with them when they jump. When they descend to the ground, they place the dummies on the ground so that others will see them as German soldiers, while the real paratroopers can take the opportunity to escape. It is also reported that several cities in the Netherlands have arrested German paratroopers disguised as priests, farmers, and in Dutch uniforms. Today, a unit of Dutch soldiers was attacked near The Hague by Dutch people disguised as German soldiers. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. The Dutch General Staff has issued a statement stating that Germans in The Hague attempted to occupy the city center. After being suppressed by our soldiers, they failed, retreating into a certain building, and surrendered after our troops opened fire. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Attack German Transportation Lines, Bomb Rotterdam Airfield Heavily</p>
<p>London. The British Air Ministry has announced details of the British Air Force's attack on Friday night on enemy forces concentrated between the Rhine and Meuse rivers. According to reports, when the British aircraft attacked, a large column of enemy forces was crossing the Rhine River towards the Dutch border. A bridge over the Rhine River near Wesel and the transportation lines leading to the bridge were hit. British aircraft repeatedly flew out and bombed important railway and highway junctions and bridges in Tiel, which further obstructed the enemy's advance. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. According to reliable sources here today, the Rotterdam airfield, which was damaged last Friday, was again subjected to extremely heavy bombing last night and this morning. After a six-hour air raid by the British Air Force, during which hundreds of bombs were dropped, the airfield became a field of flames. British bombers bombed in shifts, and the hangars were repeatedly hit. Buildings in the northeast corner of the airfield were also hit. When the British aircraft flew back this morning, everything in the airfield was in flames, and thick smoke rose high. From above, fourteen aircraft could be seen burning in the airfield, and there were no British losses. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

The semi-official Belgian News Agency has just issued a statement stating that yesterday, two passenger trains full of civilians evacuating from various places, most of whom were women and children, were bombed by German aircraft on the railway from Brussels to Liège and strafed with machine guns, causing terror among the passengers. In addition, German aircraft were active everywhere last night, bombing and strafing Allied troops departing for the Belgian front. A large number of German paratroopers landed in the western suburbs of Brussels, but most of them have been captured. Local radio stations are warning residents that the main task of these paratroopers is to plant time-delayed bombs in various highways, railways, and bridges, and they must be strictly guarded against. Furthermore, there have been four air raid alerts here since last night until this morning. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome The Director of Wartime Economic Affairs of the Italian Foreign Ministry, Piromarchi, yesterday submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Mussolini, pointing out that there were 857 incidents of violations of the law by Britain and France against Italian commercial shipping. The memorandum strongly stated that the British control system is not only aimed at belligerent countries but has also become an economic weapon to gain hegemony, and the scope of implementation has also expanded to areas that have nothing to do with the control of contraband. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome The official newspaper of the Fascist Party declared yesterday that the party is now ordered to handle civil mobilization matters, including mobilizing minors aged fourteen to eighteen and mobilizing women. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>

On the first occasion, one enemy ship (believed to be the Bremse) was hit by three bombs. The second attack completely caught the enemy by surprise, and two of the largest oil tanks were hit, causing fires to spread everywhere. Since May 8, the Naval Air Arm has destroyed many enemy aircraft on the ground in Norway and shot down twenty enemy aircraft off the coast of Norway. Anti-aircraft guns on the fleet also damaged fifty-one enemy aircraft. Note: The Bremse is a 14,000-ton German training battleship. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Churchill Cabinet Formed Five Conservative and Labour Party Members Form War Cabinet</h3>
<p>London The newly appointed Prime Minister Churchill called on King George VI at 7:35 PM today and departed at 8:00 PM, immediately forming a new cabinet. The main cabinet members are as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Minister of Defence: Churchill (Conservative Party)</p>
<p>Lord President of the Council: Chamberlain (Conservative Party)</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary: Lord Halifax (Conservative Party)</p>
<p>Lord Privy Seal: Attlee (Leader of the Labour Party)</p>
<p>Minister without Portfolio: Greenwood (Labour Party)</p>
<p>First Lord of the Admiralty: Alexander (Labour Party)</p>
<p>Secretary of State for War: Eden (Conservative Party)</p>
<p>Secretary of State for Air: Sinclair (Leader of the Liberal Party)</p>
<p>The list of ministers for other departments will be announced on Monday or Tuesday next week. Prime Minister Churchill also decided that he, Chamberlain, Halifax, Attlee, and Greenwood will form the War Cabinet. In other words, the War Cabinet is composed of three Conservative Party members and two Labour Party members. Although Liberal Party leader Sinclair is not participating, as Secretary of State for Air, his position is also very important. When general government policy issues arise, he will consult with other leaders from the Conservative, Labour, and Liberal parties outside the War Cabinet. The resumes of Attlee, Greenwood, Sinclair, and Alexander are listed below: (1) Major Attlee is 56 years old. He served as Under-Secretary of State for War in MacDonald's first cabinet in 1924 and then as Postmaster General in MacDonald's second cabinet. He is currently the leader of the Labour Party caucus in the House of Commons. (2) Greenwood is 58 years old. He served as Minister of Health in MacDonald's second cabinet. He is currently the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party caucus in the House of Commons and temporarily served as the leader of the caucus during Major Attlee's illness. (3) Sinclair is 48 years old. He served as Secretary to the War Office from 1919 to 1921 and as Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1921 to 1922. He then served as Secretary of State for Scotland in MacDonald's second cabinet. He is currently the leader of the Liberal Party caucus in the House of Commons. (4) Alexander is 56 years old. He served as First Lord of the Admiralty in MacDonald's second cabinet from 1929 to 1931. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>London Last night, Churchill was busy reviewing the affairs of other government departments, and major changes are expected. Reuters' parliamentary correspondent stated that the Labour Party may approve the organization of the War Cabinet at a meeting in Bournemouth on Monday. The initial reaction of the Labour Party to this War Cabinet last night was that only Minister Halifax in the War Cabinet is truly focusing all his efforts on the war. In terms of the scope and nature of the new appointments, Churchill has indeed adopted the views of others and not limited himself to his own opinions. The demand to organize a smaller War Cabinet has been repeatedly unsuccessful, but Churchill has now adopted it. Previously, there was an opinion in political circles that Chamberlain would resume the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer and also serve as Leader of the House of Commons so that Prime Minister Churchill could focus on cabinet affairs, but Labour Party members strongly disagreed, and some Conservative Party members also disagreed. The official announcement did not mention the Leader of the House of Commons, indicating that the leadership of the House of Commons will belong to Churchill. Alexander served as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1929 to 1931, and as expected, he has resumed the position. Eden's new appointment will be welcomed by the public, and Sinclair's appointment as Secretary of State for Air is also generally approved. Other appointments will be announced on Monday. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London Various British groups in Shanghai sent congratulatory telegrams to the new Prime Minister, expressing confidence that Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister will provide Britain with a determined leader. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "The various patriotic British groups in Shanghai, together with the China Association, the British Women's Association, the British Chamber of Commerce, and the British Overseas Chinese Federation, have heard of your assumption of the Prime Minister's office and jointly send this telegram to congratulate you on your success. We are confident that your leadership will surely inspire a firm and strong spirit to defeat the enemy." (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Situation in the Dutch East Indies Gradually Becoming Serious United States Reiterates Warning to Japan Hull Reaffirms Determination to Maintain Status Quo Far East Naval Forces Have Also Completed Deployment</h3>
<p>Washington U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday, urging governments to pay attention to the fact that the U.S. government feels a great interest in maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Hull, in response to reporters' inquiries about Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita's statement expressing Japan's insistence on maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, stated, "In recent weeks, several countries, such as Britain, Japan, and the United States, have clearly expressed in public statements their continued respect for the status quo of the East Indies. The U.S. government hopes that every government can continue to fulfill its promises." Hull then reiterated his statement of April 17 regarding maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, stating, "There is no need to reiterate the intention to respect the status quo of the East Indies all the time." Hull's reiteration of the U.S. government's attitude towards the East Indies did not stir up a reaction in diplomatic circles, as they all believe that the current situation in the Far East is in a standstill. Officials here firmly believe that the current situation in the Far East will not lead to disputes. Officials claim that they believe that Japan is willing to wait for the development of the situation and is prepared to take advantage of any disruption. The U.S. government is also prepared to take the same action, adopting a wait-and-see attitude to maintain the status quo of the East Indies to their satisfaction. The State Department claims that they have not received any alarming inquiries from the Philippines. Well-informed sources believe that Japan will not threaten the Philippines at this time unless Japan wants to use the Philippines as a base to seize the Dutch East Indies, which is Japan's main economic target. Conversely, when the Japanese navy approaches the East Indies, its rear guard fleet will be threatened by the Philippines' navy. The United States has small naval bases in Cavite and Olongapo in the Philippines for emergency use. The East Indies is 2,000 miles from Japan's nearest naval base. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington Secretary of State Hull repeatedly stated yesterday that if there is any change in the status of the Dutch East Indies, the United States will regard it as harmful to the security and peace of the entire Pacific region. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington Diplomatic circles here are extremely concerned about the situation in the Far East and deeply worried that Japan will take action against the Dutch East Indies. Naval officials say that the U.S. Army has already made arrangements in that area and will not be caught off guard. The authorities have also dispatched several light cruisers to Manila, but the main forces will remain stationed in the waters off Hawaii, as planned by Admiral Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. In addition, Secretary of State Hull's statement today shows that the authorities are indeed feeling uneasy about the situation in the Dutch East Indies. Hull said that respecting the status quo of the Dutch East Indies is an essential condition for maintaining peace in the Pacific. This statement is clearly a very serious warning to the Japanese government. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Fleet Remains Stationed in Hawaii Contains Significant Meaning President to Request Increased Defence Budget Expected to be Approved by Congress</h3>
<p>Washington The "Army and Navy Gazette" published yesterday stated that the U.S. fleet's stationing in Hawaii is a demonstration of respect for Secretary of State Hull's declaration of concern for the Dutch East Indies. The newspaper's editorial stated, "President Roosevelt's order for the fleet to remain in Hawaiian territorial waters is clearly a premonition that the Netherlands will be invaded. The purpose of this order is to ensure the security of the Pacific... To reduce the possibility of incidents in the Far East that concern the Allied powers, this measure is necessary." The newspaper further stated that the Japanese military has been obstructed by the U.S. attitude. "It is rumored that the U.S. government is preparing to send a fleet to be stationed in Singapore and is also borrowing Saigon and Hong Kong. Undoubtedly, Japan has taken these rumors seriously." (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington Some leaders in the U.S. Congress declared yesterday that the government's policy will lead the United States into the vortex of war in the Far East. Congress is preparing to accelerate the army, navy, and air force preparedness process. President Roosevelt will request Congress in a few days to increase the peacetime defence budget of US$2,000,000,000 by 25 percent. Republican and Democratic congressmen jointly predict that the President's request will be approved by Congress, but 20 isolationist senators will meet tomorrow to discuss strategies to oppose the increase in the budget. The government will also resubmit a request for US$20 million to purchase anti-submarine nets to protect Pearl Harbor and its ports in Hawaii. White House Secretary Early told reporters yesterday that the President received thousands of telegrams yesterday, 90 percent of which supported the President's speech on Friday, while others requested "maintaining peace at any cost." (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington U.S. President's Secretary Early recently stated that President Roosevelt's speech yesterday, which included the phrase "overseas aggression has posed a real challenge to American civilization," has aroused a good response across the country, and the President is very pleased.

<h3>Allied Navies Land in the West Indies Jointly Prevent German Sabotage Attempts Situation Notified to U.S. Government</h3>
<p>London It was announced here today that Allied naval forces have landed on the islands of Curaçao and Aruba in the Dutch West Indies to prevent German conspiracies. Allied diplomatic representatives in the United States have reported this situation to the U.S. government. Responsible sources in London have stated that the Dutch, French, and British governments have discussed taking steps to prevent German attempts to sabotage the important oil refineries on Curaçao and Aruba. As local authorities do not have sufficient military force to deal with such sabotage attempts, it was agreed to immediately send troops to cooperate with local administrative agencies to implement the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the islands. It is reported that the landing troops of the Allied forces were warmly welcomed by the local people. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington The Dutch Embassy here announced yesterday that The Hague has planned to prepare for joint British protection of the Dutch West Indies to prevent possible sabotage. The announcement stated that British and French troops will soon land there. The Venezuelan Chargé d'Affaires told Undersecretary of State Welles that if the oil refineries in the West Indies are destroyed, Venezuela's economy will be severely hit, as most of the country's oil production is handled by the West Indies. It is believed that the United States will not oppose the Allied forces landing in the U.S. neutral zone, as Britain, France, and the Netherlands have now become Allied countries. At the moment, the U.S. fleet is protecting the entire area of the West Indies. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin Regarding the British and French troops occupying the two islands of the Dutch West Indies, German newspapers are paying close attention, believing it to be British and French interference in the Western Hemisphere and an intrusion into the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. General Göring's mouthpiece, the "Essener National-Zeitung," declared that the two islands are located in an extremely important position outside the Panama Canal. Now that they have been occupied by British and French troops, the United States cannot but pay attention. The German News Agency pointed out that the Governor-General of the Dutch West Indies recently issued a declaration stating that the international status of the islands must be maintained, but now they have been forcibly occupied by British troops, blatantly disregarding the wishes and protests of the Dutch islands. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Trade Routes in the Dutch East Indies U.S. Officials Express Great Concern</h3>
<p>Washington Officials here are expressing great concern about future imports from the Dutch East Indies. Businessmen believe that if trade routes can continue to be maintained, the Dutch East Indies can largely offset the losses of the U.S. export market in Belgium and the Netherlands. Representative White of New York requested that the U.S. procedure for purchasing war materials should be increased rapidly. He claimed that if the U.S. joins the war, the supply of tin will only be sufficient for three days. Commerce Secretary Hagens has cancelled all leave and holidays in his department. Yesterday, he discussed with President Roosevelt the issue of obtaining supplies of rubber and tin raw materials. Hagens said that the current U.S. supply of rubber and tin is sufficient to maintain the market for three to four days. Last year, U.S. exports to the East Indies totaled US$35,420,000, while imports totaled US$92,971,000. U.S. exports to the Netherlands were US$96,939,000, and imports were US$28,933,000. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Implements Neutrality Regulations on the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Emergency Committee to Handle Dutch Shipping and Financial Affairs in the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington According to an order issued by President Roosevelt, the U.S. Neutrality Act is being implemented in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. In other words, the United States can no longer lend to the above three countries, and the "cash and carry" provision is immediately effective. At the same time, U.S. citizens are not allowed to travel on Dutch and Belgian ships, and U.S. ships are not allowed to dock at Dutch and Belgian ports. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>New York Two Dutch merchant ships that were originally scheduled to sail on Friday are still moored in the port. The Dutch Consul General stated that an emergency committee will be established soon to handle Dutch shipping and financial affairs in the U.S. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington President Roosevelt recently telegraphed King Leopold, stating, "Our nation deeply hopes that those who use force and aggression to control peaceful and independent nations will eventually meet with failure. At the same time, we hope that your government and people can maintain freedom and territorial integrity. I stated to representatives of other American countries yesterday that the act of brutally invading Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg has angered the American people, and I believe that the people of other countries in the Western Hemisphere must feel the same way." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Pravda Comments on the Fate of the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Moscow Regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, Pravda commented, "The recent developments in the Netherlands have made the fate of the Dutch East Indies even more serious. Japan is paying close attention to this rich colony, which has provoked retaliatory steps from the United States. The United States has now stationed a large part of its Pacific Fleet in Hawaii indefinitely, with a strength of 11 battleships, 11 cruisers, and 40 destroyers. In addition, there are 10 cruisers and 20 destroyers in the permanent fleet. The powerful U.S. fleet is indeed a threat to Japan, but its actions are inevitably somewhat difficult due to the long distance from the war zone. Britain is also paying close attention to the Dutch East Indies and will not allow Japan to attack it. In short, the recent changes in the situation have made all imperialist countries attempt to act as protectors of the Dutch East Indies. Undoubtedly, the imperialist struggle for the Dutch East Indies will become more acute." (TASS, 11th)</p>

<h3>Disaster Situation in Hebei Province is Unique North China Flood Relief Association Unable to Achieve Its Mission Relief Workers Sometimes Killed Funds Received by Disaster Victims Again Subject to Exploitation</h3>
<p>Chongqing Recently, various parties and public opinion circles still have many misunderstandings about the disaster relief situation in Hebei Province and have made repeated criticisms. The following is a statement by Sun Ya-fu, Director-General of the North China Flood Relief Association: "The disaster area in Hebei Province covers 100 counties and cities, with over 7 million disaster victims and over 35.59 million mu of affected area. In addition to the floods, the province is also afflicted by war, drought, and insect plagues, which are particularly severe compared to other provinces. The disaster relief fund is 1.5 million yuan, and the Relief Committee has successively allocated over 500,000 yuan to the province, totaling over 2 million yuan. Special Commissioner Wang Bao-zhen of the province has departed from Chongqing, passed through Xi'an and Luoyang, and is preparing to cross the Yellow River north to distribute funds on the ground. However, the disaster area environment is changing repeatedly, and local order is extremely unstable. As it is necessary to advance with the army in order to truly benefit the people, for the sake of unified authority, the Executive Yuan has ordered Chairman X to be responsible. In addition, problems are also occurring in the disaster relief work in Hebei Province. It goes without saying that the Japanese puppets are obstructing the government's benevolent policies, and local special forces are constantly hindering the work. The 220,000 yuan previously allocated by the Relief Committee had already reached the disaster area, and a field survey and distribution had been conducted. However, after receiving the relief funds, the people were soon burdened with levies that were double the amount of the relief funds. Seeking survival only leads to a quicker death. In addition, relief workers are facing unprecedented persecution. In addition to relief funds being robbed, as many as 20 soldiers and officers have been killed. Therefore, under these circumstances, relief workers sacrifice their lives but are still unable to achieve their mission. Since the start of the war of resistance, the central government has attached special importance to relief work, instructing the responsible agencies to find ways to provide relief and comfort at any time, in any place, and in any type of disaster. This association has an unshirkable responsibility. In the future, this association will only follow the central government's instructions, not shunning danger or fearing violence, and will step up its efforts to reach the mission early, rescuing the remaining people."

<h3>European Wartime Scenes (1) - The New Life of Londoners Under the Blackout</h3>
<p>British military strategists initially envisioned extinguishing lights every night to prevent enemy aircraft from finding their targets. However, they did not anticipate that this plan would affect the daily lives and cultural pursuits of citizens, and even their physical well-being.</p>
<p>The blackout has produced some strange phenomena. It has forced inherently kind and traditionally conservative people to adopt many new habits. The control policy is creating cultural isolationism. It has increased prosperity for some, while others have suffered unexpected losses in their livelihoods. Occasionally, it even causes the normally cheerful British to vent their pent-up frustrations.</p>
<p>Many commercial firms, shops, and institutions have significantly altered their previously inviolable working hours. With shorter winter days, many businesses close two or more hours earlier, allowing employees to return home before the blackout, reducing traffic congestion and the risk of accidents. Now that spring has arrived, and daylight saving time is in effect, working hours have been extended again.</p>
<p>After returning home, everyone contemplates how to spend the long nights. Some, unwilling to venture out into the dark, dew-laden outdoors, listen to free radio broadcasts at home, or play cards. Others bury themselves in books for entertainment. But night after night, this monotonous life inevitably evokes the old desire for novelty.</p>
<p>Many people confined to their homes have developed a need to make their own music. As a result, amateur music has become popular for a time. Those who can afford it buy pianos—small, sonorous pianos that can be placed in any corner, regardless of the size of the room or the number of people. Even if these people have never played the piano before, or have become rusty over time, it doesn't matter. Correspondence courses can solve everything. Because everyone is inclined towards music, family bands are emerging. An old British wind instrument, similar to a recorder, is becoming popular because it is easy to play and the pitch is easily controlled. Family members often each have one and play together. Some families even practice group singing, seeking their own refined entertainment.</p>
<p>Another old habit has also arisen from the blackout—so old and outdated that it seems new to many—that is, families sitting around the fireplace, taking turns reading aloud from books. Classic literature, new novels, and magazines, which people previously had no time to read, are now being read by many, who consider it informative discussion material.</p>
<p>Among the many strange situations, the study of astronomy is perhaps the most remarkable. People who previously had a superficial understanding of astronomy, or had never studied it, are now frequently looking up and observing the sky.</p>
<p>Those who host banquets or invite friends for nighttime entertainment inevitably add a "but": if the night happens to be moonlit, then guests will certainly come in droves because it is easy to travel. No moon in the sky, no banquets on earth.</p>
<p>There are many such wonderful things that were once taken for granted but are now appreciated. After reading books about the moon, everyone turns their attention to the stars, their names, locations, and so on. The blackout provides these amateur researchers with great assistance in observing the sky; the sky is full of stars, a brilliant blue, with no stray light from nearby towns, making it ideal for those who want to study the heavens.</p>
<p>The combination of the blackout and the evacuation of women and children from densely populated areas has fostered new friendships and relationships, thereby expanding people's "spheres of influence," introducing them to many friends, and adding countless interests.</p>
<p>A wealthy family living in the suburbs of London can be cited as an example. After the father sent his children and grandparents to a safe area in the countryside, his wife volunteered to stay with him in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The couple inevitably felt lonely. After being introduced by friends, they met several married people whose families had also been evacuated, and invited these couples to live in the empty rooms in their house, sharing household expenses. This marked the beginning of a communal living arrangement, with the heads of households living in one house, expenses reduced due to sharing, and everyone enjoying common interests and making many new friends.</p>
<p>In this new situation, some have gained unexpected jobs, while others have become idle. Some have earned a lot of money, while others have lost everything out of nowhere. It can be described as unpredictable and fickle.</p>
<p>Music teachers who make a living through correspondence courses have seen their incomes increase daily, while those who teach face-to-face have experienced a gradual decrease in income. Several cinemas in the city center have seen a sharp drop in ticket sales because of the blackout and patrons' unwillingness to grope around in the dark. However, several cinemas in the suburbs are doing brisk business because they are within easy reach.</p>
<p>The blackout has affected the health of night workers in factories, docks, offices, and shipyards. For example, dockworkers have to work twenty-four hours a day. These health issues have attracted the attention of the Chambers of Commerce and internal officials, who are reviewing them.</p>
<p>In this decisive war, the daily lives and habits of countless British fighters have been given new colors by the blackout, some bright and some dark. (Translated from the New York Times Magazine)</p>

<h3>The Current Situation of National Tsing Hua University During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) Mei Yi-qi, the president of National Tsing Hua University, recently wrote an article entitled "Tsing Hua During the War of Resistance," in which he spoke in great detail about the university's current situation. The original text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>The Condition of New and Old Campuses</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has lasted for two years and nine months. Our entire nation, in this arduous and difficult struggle, has trapped the Japanese in an inextricable position. Although lost territories have not been fully recovered, there is reason for optimism about the future. The day when we see "Shui Mu Tsing Hua" again may not be far off. According to recent news from Peiping, the situation in Tsing Hua Garden remains as described last year. The College of Engineering, the Office Building, the Gongzi Hall, the A, B, and C Dormitories of the Second Academy, the Girls' Dormitory, and Xin Nan Yuan, are still occupied by Japanese soldiers. The New Gymnasium and the Biology Building are still being used as stables. The Library, the Chemistry Building, the Science Building, and the Fourth and Fifth Academy dormitories are all used as hospitals for wounded soldiers. Sometimes there are as many as two or three thousand wounded soldiers. Scattered equipment is often stolen and sold. However, it is said that most of the books in the Library's stacks have not been damaged. The university's personnel remaining in Peiping are confined to the city and cannot inquire about the situation in the Garden. They only learn a thing or two when they occasionally meet old school workers who come from the Garden. The buildings of our university in Changsha have all been completed. Despite the great fire in Changsha the year before last and the Battle of Northern Hunan last year, the university's buildings remain intact. A portion of the agricultural produce on the campus has even yielded a bumper harvest. Since coming to Kunming, two years have passed in an instant. Most of the university's offices are rented civilian houses, which are barely sufficient. Only the various research institutes, since their establishment in Kunming, have repeatedly relocated due to the uncertainty of their sites, which is particularly inconvenient. Last spring, we rented over one hundred mu of land from the provincial agricultural farm, part of which is used for agricultural experiments, and part of which is reserved for the construction of buildings for two or three research institutes. However, due to the particularly high cost of labor and materials recently, we have only been able to build dozens of thatched huts, which are barely sufficient for research work.</p>

<p>The situation of the Southwest Associated University is that, since 1939, the number of students has suddenly increased to more than 3,000. The number of former students of our university is 316. At the end of the last academic year, 167 students of our university graduated. During the War of Resistance, three batches of graduates from our university, totaling 256 in 1937, 207 in 1938, and 167 in 1939, or 620 in total, have all been able to serve the country in this great era, which is also gratifying. The Southwest Associated University's new campus outside Da Xidou in Kunming has been fully completed. However, the capacity of its classrooms and dormitories is still less than half of what the entire university needs. In addition, the general office still has to be located within the Industrial School, and part of Kunhua Middle School and Kunhua Normal School still have to be rented as classrooms and dormitories. The College of Engineering is still located in the Dong Yi Xi Guild Hall. Since renting the nearby Jiangxi Guild Hall last spring, the laboratories of the various departments of the College of Engineering have been able to be arranged and are now roughly in place. As for the administrative structure of the Southwest Associated University and the establishment of departments and programs, there have been no changes, as described last year. In terms of funding, this year's total expenses are 160,000 to 170,000 more than last year, but due to the sudden increase in the number of students and the soaring prices of various goods, income is insufficient to cover expenses, which is even worse than last year. Fortunately, in the past two years, the university's equipment has been purchased in batches with subsidies from the China Foundation, the British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees, and the Ministry of Education. In addition, Tsing Hua's equipment transported from Hankou and transferred from Chongqing to Hankou is used as much as possible. Recently, a batch of books and instruments from Nankai University will soon be transported to Chongqing, which can勉强應付 the needs of general teaching reference and practice, especially the addition of a practical factory in the College of Engineering, accepting external commissions to manufacture and repair objects, so that students can participate in practical work, with the most effectiveness. From the autumn of 1937 to the spring of 1938, during the temporary study period in Changsha, the school's situation can be said to have been the worst. The school buildings were relocated again and again, and teachers and students traveled thousands of miles, during which they were颠沛流离, and the suffering was indescribable. After two years of painstaking management, the school buildings have been fixed, the equipment has gradually been filled, and the students' level has also improved year by year. The original spirit of the three schools has been潜滋默化融洽 into the entire Southwest Associated University. I am very pleased to describe the school's situation.</p>
<p>General School Undertakings</p>
<p>As for Tsing Hua's undertakings, the establishment of five research institutes (Agriculture, Aeronautical Engineering, Radio, Metallurgy, and National Conditions Survey) was briefly described in last year's report. In the past year, the work of each institute has been extremely diligent, and each has achieved some results. The detailed situation of their progress will be published in another article, which will not be repeated here. We often believe that the task of the university is to cultivate talents for the country. However, cultivating talents cannot be done on a whim, and our country is in a time when it is in urgent need of talents. In addition to promoting the work of various research institutes, we have jointly辦辦 two things with relevant parts of the government in response to government needs: one is the exploration of Yunnan's hydropower, and the other is the experiment of highway research (one is the National Resources Commission, and the other is the Ministry of Communications). The two were jointly funded by the agency, and the school contributed its talents and original equipment to work together. The former has yielded considerable results and has been adopted by relevant agencies. The latter, although it has not been opened for a long time, is working very hard. It is expected that it will be able to contribute to the problem of highway construction in the future. The Tsing Hua public-funded students studying in the United States have been suspended since the summer of 1937, and it will soon be three years. Students from the previous four sessions who were sent to Europe and the United States will all be returning to China one after another. We certainly know the economic difficulties during the War of Resistance. We especially know the urgent need for talents in the cause of national construction. If we do not store talents now for the construction of the country in the future, there will be a feeling of talent shortage in the future. Therefore, we obtained the approval of the government this spring to continue to recruit 20 public-funded students to study in the United States from this year. The examination categories and all regulations have been drafted and are scheduled to be held in August this summer. In addition, starting this summer, 15 scholarships for self-funded graduate students studying in the United States will be added, with each scholarship being awarded (US dollars) 400 yuan per year. All of this is to show the government's desire for talents and to continue the mission that our school has shouldered for 31 years, even though the school's funds are not abundant and foreign exchange is difficult to obtain. However, this is still a large expense, and the number of places is limited, and the effect is not宏. Judging from the actual situation, it is not a long-term plan. For this reason, the school resumed the graduate school in the summer of 1939, so that a group of university graduates would have the opportunity to study in depth. In addition to the original departments, the 文科硏究所 includes (1) the Chinese Literature Department, (2) the Foreign Language Department, (5) the Philosophy Department, (6) the History Department, the 理科硏究所 includes (1) the Physics Department, (2) the Mathematics Department, (3) the Biology Department, and three more departments of the College of Engineering: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Aviation, and Electrical Engineering. Last summer, a total of 25 new and old students were enrolled. The Department of Political Economy and the Department of Chemistry will not enroll students for the time being because the equipment is not sufficient. The situation of each department will be restored this summer.</p>
<p>Supporting Alumni Career</p>
<p>Tsinghua's own undertakings are as described above. There are undertakings run by alumni in various places that are also supported by the school, such as the private Tsinghua Middle Schools in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places. The funds and organization of the original Tsinghua Middle Schools in various places are all handled by the alumni who founded them in various places. After a considerable period of time, they have achieved considerable results. The school has provided assistance in terms of manpower and material resources to the extent possible (without affecting the school's budget). In the past, the school has recruited new students, and the number of applicants has reached thousands, and the admission rate is less than one in ten. The low level of general middle schools is undeniable. The middle school stage is the backbone of school education and the foundation of the university. If this is not sound or has defects, it is not easy to promote university education. Our alumni in various places have focused on the middle school business based on this policy. I am most excited and willing to support this. Although the number of middle school students is small, these middle schools were all founded after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. The needs of secondary schools in the rear have become urgent. Students and gentlemen have resolutely done so in order to meet this need, not fearing difficulties and enduring hardships. This and the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War can be admired. However, once the war is over and the situation in various places changes greatly in terms of educational needs, then these middle schools should all continue to be maintained, and in terms of manpower and material resources, they can all continue to be maintained. These problems must be considered in addition to today's hard work. However, we are doing things, we have already put our hands on the plow, and we have no turning back. Today, we can only work hard and listen to the future for success or failure. (End)</p>

<h3>Small Football Match Yesterday: The French Business Council and the Cantopop Team Tie; The Result is Zero to Zero, with Neither Side Gaining Anything</h3>
<p>The Zhendan Cup small football match had three tense matches yesterday, especially the match between the Cantopop Team and the French Business Council. Currently, the Cantopop Team has a record of five matches, four wins, and one draw. Whether it can win a partial championship will depend on its final match against Lido. This is because Lido, which is closely following behind, has a record of four matches, three wins, and one loss. Lido has two matches left, one against the French Business Council and the other against the Cantopop Team. If Lido can defeat the French Business Council and the Cantopop Team is unfortunately defeated by Lido, then the championship will be won by Lido. Therefore, the failure of the Cantopop Team to gain one more point yesterday is extremely important. If this point is润 by the French Business Council, then even if the Cantopop Team is unfortunately defeated by Lido, there will still be a chance to re-decide.</p>
<p>The French Business Council is strong, and the Cantopop Team is sharp in both foot and brain. Before the war, it was predicted that there would be a fierce battle. As expected, the war lasted for 70 minutes yesterday and nothing was gained from the beginning to the end. As a result, the Cantopop Team was 汤团 and the French Business Council was 鸭蛋, and the game ended in a 0-0 draw. The French Business Council's new goalkeeper, Little Yellow Hair Payer, who had just returned from Hong Kong, was not inferior to the ape Willie, and saved countless dangerous balls.</p>
<p>Cantopop Team: Qin Bi Gao, Yue Renxiao, Zhou Kecheng, Chen Yuanji, Liao Shiyi, Xiao Xintian, Gao Baozheng,</p>
<p>French Business Council: Payer, Sa Wen, Willie Walter, Bei Kuilai, Xue Geren, Bao Xiu, Shi Peisi (above), Mi Hailuofu (below),</p>

<h3>Two Mile Overall Test: Wang Zhenglin Wins Championship</h3>
<p>High Hopes for Police Spring Games; Hongkou Dong Sele to Compete</p>
<p>The Hua long-distance running giants of the Hongkou Cross-country Team, who are preparing to compete for the Public Concession Police Department's Spring Games Open Two-Mile Team Championship, held a general test of two miles at Jiaozhou Park at 6:30 am yesterday. Various cross-country teams such as Huizhen, Qingguang, and Youqiang were invited to join the test. A total of more than 60 athletes participated. The order was given by Liang Yaoting, and the time was recorded by Sun Yuanzhang. The test results were quite good. Long-distance running trustee Wang Zhenglin lacked competitors and still won the championship. The entire journey yesterday required circling the garden lawn for nine laps, measuring two miles, or 3,200 meters. This Public Concession Police Department's Spring Games will be held at the Racecourse. The Racecourse was once the finish line for marathon long-distance running. It has been several years since it stopped being lent to Chinese. In order to actively prepare, the Hongkou Cross-country Team will (on the 17th) invite the British Army Dong Sele to hold a small-scale competition at Jiaozhou Park this week. The list of the top ten winners yesterday is as follows: First Wang Zhenglin (Hongkou), Second Guan Youwen (Hongkou), Third Luo Da (Hongkou), Fourth Qian Zhenxing (Qingguang), Fifth Zhou Ruji (Hongkou), Sixth Wu Yuan (Qingguang), Seventh Zhou Songlin (Huizhen), Eighth Ni Weida (Hongkou), Ninth Hu Shugen (Youqiang), Tenth Lu Tingfu (Youqiang),</p>

<h3>Elementary School Basketball Tournament: The Guoben Cup Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guoben Moore Reports Victory</p>
<p>The Guoben Cup All-Shanghai Elementary School Basketball Tournament, hosted by Guoben Elementary School on Jiaozhou Road, opened at the school yesterday afternoon. Yu Jinxing opened the ball. In the first match, Guoben played against Qiguang. As a result, Guoben won 32-20. The second match was an exhibition match. Shanghai Women's Middle School played against Daozhong Women's Middle School. The victory belonged to the former. In the third match, Aiguo Women's Middle School played a volleyball exhibition match against the Deformed Team of the Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers' School. As a result, Aiguo won 21-17, 21-19. At the end of the game, Moore Hall and Qinghua of the Muel League faced off. The former relied on skilled cooperation and won 14-8. The tournament received donations of large silver cups from Liu Chongheng, the president of the Wenyou Literary and Art Institute, and Yuan Shuyuan, which were awarded to the winners to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Binhai Cup Women's Volleyball Postponed</h3>
<p>The "Binhai Cup" Women's Volleyball Tournament, hosted by Binhai Middle School on Nanyang Road, was originally scheduled to start on the 12th of this month. Now, because the Central Guoshu Museum borrowed the school's stadium to perform Guoshu on that day, the time conflicted. The school has now postponed the volleyball tournament to the 19th, and the registration deadline for each school team has also been extended to the 16th.</p>

<h3>How About the Future of Foreign Exchange (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhi</p>
<p>This article focuses on predicting the future of foreign exchange based on the current situation. It shares a connection with this publication's issue 244-5 article, "How About the Future of Legal Tender," which examines the future of legal tender itself. Although the latter was written two years ago, none of the points discussed have changed, and they will likely never change, so it is worth reading for reference.</p>
<p>This article is divided into twelve sections, which will be published successively in this publication. Here is a preview of the outline:</p>
<p>1.  Now We Should Be Silently Laughing (Last Issue) 2. "Gold Treasury Bonds" and the Stabilization Fund (Last Issue)</p>
<p>2.  "Restricted Withdrawals" and the Frequent Theft Cases (Last Issue) 4. "Not Maintaining" Is More Difficult Than Maintaining (This Issue)</p>
<p>3.  The Possibility of Sino-American Exchange Cooperation (This Issue) 6. Trade Deficit and the Stabilization Fund (To Be Continued)</p>
<p>4.  Legal Tender Gold Reserves and Foreign Capital (To Be Continued) 8. The Truth About the Bankruptcy of the Ruble and the Mark (To Be Continued)</p>
<p>5.  "Natural Level" and Artificial Level (To Be Continued) 10. Foreign Currency Value and Investment Interests (To Be Continued)</p>
<p>6.  The Expansion of the European War and the Future of the US Dollar (This Issue) 12. The Maximum Extent of Japanese and Puppet Sabotage (To Be Continued)</p>
<p>The fluctuations in the black foreign exchange market have always been known to be due to "人心虛" (a lack of confidence in the market), and therefore easily swayed by all sorts of rumors and slander. But why is there this lack of confidence? First, it’s a misunderstanding due to a lack of understanding of the reality; second, it’s a lack of judgment, making people easily surrounded by deceptive words; third, it's cherishing private wealth but not knowing how to maintain it reasonably; fourth, speculators each hold the mentality of "others are doing it, why shouldn't I?". Therefore, although historical facts have always shattered rumors, whenever rumors rise again, everyone's psychology cannot help but be affected. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide various basic facts related to the future of the foreign exchange market, to help readers enhance their judgment, so that everyone can be psychologically prepared. This should have been published sequentially according to each section's order, but because the expansion of the European war and the changes in the future of the US dollar have a particularly profound relationship with the black foreign exchange market in this city, this section is published early, and the rest will still be published in order.</p>
<p>Some parts of this article were mentioned during a speech at a banquet hosted by the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association on May 8. To avoid misunderstandings due to different authorship, this is specially noted.</p>
<p>"Not Maintaining" Is More Difficult Than Maintaining</p>
<p>From the outbreak of the turmoil on May 2nd until the supply from Hong Kong arrived on May 6th, there was no news at all. The more eagerly everyone awaited news from the Ministry of Finance, the more silent the Ministry of Finance seemed to be. As a result, people became even more panicked, and rumors spread in the market that "the Ministry of Finance has decided to permanently abandon the black foreign exchange market in Shanghai." The policy of not maintaining the black foreign exchange market has long been studied and advocated by general scholars; and every drastic change in the black foreign exchange market always begins with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation stopping supply. Although supply is immediately restored after the significance of stopping supply has been completed, each time the supply is stopped, the market worries that "this time maybe it really won't be maintained anymore." This mentality is extremely common. This time, the silence of the Ministry of Finance was particularly severe, so the threat of this rumor was also particularly severe. Although this threat has now been lifted, there are still many people who are worried that "there will always be such a day." This is really an unreasonable杞憂 (unnecessary worry). Because the Ministry of Finance's policy is consistent and unchanging, and it is 父非此不可 (absolutely necessary).</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the basic policies of the Ministry of Finance, nor how the consequences of "not maintaining" will be. Even if we take a step back and ask "is there a possibility of implementing not maintaining," we can firmly believe that the government will never implement this "not maintaining" policy. Simple-minded people may think that "not maintaining" is the easiest thing to do. Little do they know that "not maintaining" is actually more difficult than "continuing to maintain." Because the government has the strength, as long as it is willing to provide the precious resources of the war of resistance for the squandering of Shanghai people, it can complete the effect of "maintaining." If it really "doesn't maintain," then it will immediately cause many complex and unsolvable problems.</p>
<p>In theory: the black foreign exchange is illegal; the ins and outs are Japanese puppets and the speculators who have no patriotic concepts; why should the government maintain it? This is one reason. The value of the black foreign exchange cannot represent the true value of the legal tender; not maintaining the black foreign exchange does not hinder the legal tender. This is the second reason. But the factual problem is not that simple.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the black foreign exchange market price cannot represent the true value of the legal tender. It is also undeniable that the existence of the black foreign exchange market price, in addition to the true value of the legal tender, also creates a market purchasing power that forcibly rapes the legal tender. This market purchasing power, through Shanghai's trade relations with the inland, directly and indirectly affects inland prices. The trend of wartime prices is rising, and the rising trend is even greater due to cargo transportation and other factors. How can we allow it to be affected by the black foreign exchange market again? General scholars feel that the black foreign exchange market in Shanghai is a major loophole in the operation of China's resistance and construction economy. It is unwise to fill this bottomless hole with maintenance; it is not only a waste of money,縱法 (to indulge and encourage certain behaviors), and aiding the enemy, but also ultimately unable to eliminate its influence. "Rather than continuing ineffective maintenance and wasting money, it is better to cut it off with one knife and not maintain it at all." However, this is an emotional statement, and the country must not act on emotion. Today's Shanghai, although its contribution to the war of resistance and construction is negligible, it has more than enough ability to cause trouble. It is right to use "not maintaining" to punish the black foreign exchange market, but preparations must be made first to eliminate the possibility of causing trouble. And this preparation:</p>
<p>The first is to establish a complete and powerful price control network.</p>
<p>The second is to fully complete the self-sufficiency of essential goods in the inland.</p>
<p>Only then can the trade relationship between the inland and Shanghai be severed.</p>
<p>The completion of the first condition depends on the completion of the latter two conditions. With the inland's economic resources and the current rate of rapid construction, there is indeed no problem in completing these three conditions. But it will always take a considerable amount of time. However, in the coordination of this time, I am afraid that before the completion of the above conditions, the enemy will have suffered a complete defeat due to the economic collapse of his country. Therefore, although "not maintaining" is in line with the interests of national policy, it is actually more difficult to implement than maintaining. Continuing to maintain, although we know it is unwise, is still necessary in fact. However, in order to reduce the disadvantages of maintenance, we occasionally stop the supply temporarily to smash the Japanese and puppet's arbitrage. But once this purpose is accomplished, we will inevitably continue to work hard to maintain it without slackening. Therefore, those who fear non-maintenance and want to escape capital will inevitably lose more and more capital as they escape. They may not yet realize their losses, but when they realize it, it will be too late to save it.</p>
<p>The Possibility of Sino-American Exchange Cooperation</p>
<p>The famous American educator Dr. Paul Monroe recently publicly advocated that "the United States should assist China's legal tender with financial resources"; American expatriates in Shanghai even telegraphed the US President, responding to this proposal. The market values this information.</p>
<p>Exchange rates are essentially an economic tie between countries. It is necessary between two or more countries that treat each other equally, in order to promote each other's commercial interests and stabilize each other's exchange rates. The rights and obligations arising from this are also equal to each other. The word "assistance" is really inappropriate. China benefits from a low exchange rate, because it can curb import surpluses and adjust its balance of international payments. Therefore, stabilizing the exchange rate between China and foreign countries actually benefits the UK and the US more than China; there is no such thing as "assistance". In this regard: there is little doubt that the UK and the US are happy to "assist China's legal tender." What's more, there are many political necessities in addition to this.</p>
<p>China was forced to resist the war, originally for the purpose of ensuring the independence, freedom, survival, and sovereignty of the Chinese nation; therefore, it has gained the enthusiastic sympathy and assistance of just countries all over the world. The UK and the US have special rights in the Far East, and Japan's invasion of China is the first step in its unique frost Far East exclusion of British and American forces. Therefore, the sympathy and assistance of the UK and the US to China's war of resistance is more natural and necessary than other countries. Therefore, as long as Japan invades China for one day, Sino-British exchange cooperation will continue for one day. Although the expansion of the European war does not increase the difficulty for the UK to take care of the Far East issue, this trivial burden is no problem for the UK. Moreover, the UK values reality, and is more than happy to provide this insignificant burden in exchange for China's broad friendship!</p>
<p>As for the United States, if exchange cooperation is established with China, it is not that the US government is unwilling to do so, but that the Chinese government is unwilling to do so. This point should be specially mentioned. As mentioned earlier: maintaining the black foreign exchange is not in line with national policy. What China needs is reasonable trade and reasonable prices. That is to say: on the one hand, it hopes that essential goods will be imported at high exchange rates, while on the other hand, it hopes that non-essential and luxury goods will be suppressed at low exchange rates to prevent their import. The fluctuations in the black market exchange rate affect essential and non-essential goods indiscriminately. Therefore, it is beneficial to maintain the black exchange rate at a low level; to encourage the import of essential goods, there is only separate mechanism. Maintaining the legal exchange market and obtaining export credit from various countries to China is the current main strategy. It is more than enough to maintain the black market with Sino-British cooperation. For other countries, it is important to obtain export credit for export. In recent years, the United States has provided China with export credit twice publicly, totaling 50 million US dollars. From this, it can be seen that as long as the Chinese government is willing, the US government will be happy to establish exchange cooperation with China, just like today's Sino-British exchange cooperation. Therefore, there is an absolute possibility for the establishment of Sino-American exchange cooperation; but there is no such necessity yet. From this, it can also be disproved the absurdity of the saying that "the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund has been exhausted."</p>
<h3>The Expansion of the European War and the Future of the US Dollar This is the Twelfth Section of "How About the Future of Foreign Exchange"</h3>
<p>After the German army invaded the neutral countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the European war truly entered the scale of World War II. Restricted withdrawals, intercepted debts, managed trade, and controlled foreign exchange - this series of wartime policies to block and control the international flow of funds is bound to unfold and strengthen in war-torn countries one by one. The direct result is that the international exchange market will first stir up unprecedented changes; the indirect result is that the future of the currencies of all war-torn countries, as well as countries that temporarily maintain neutrality but will eventually participate in the war, will inevitably fall into the stream of unknowable fate and be difficult to predict. At this moment, what deserves the most attention is of course the US dollar.</p>
<p>Judging from the United States' position in the world economy, the expansion of the European war, although it can make the currencies of other countries feel a serious threat; as for the United States, it will instead benefit from it alone. The main reasons are four: (1) The capital of various countries is fleeing to the United States one after another, or being converted into US dollars for hoarding. (2) The need for American goods from war-torn countries has increased, increasing the need for US dollars. (3) Regardless of whether the United States participates in the war or always maintains its neutrality, there will never be war within the Americas, so its economy will inevitably develop more and more, and the foundation of the US dollar will become stronger and stronger. (4) The US economy, in peacetime, will indeed experience panics such as overproduction, so it has to implement low exchange rate policies to seek overseas markets and maintain them. Now, it has invisibly become the main supplier of war materials. It is only afraid of insufficient production and will never have the threat of overproduction again. Since the foreign market is extremely solid and broad, there is no reason for it to implement a devaluation policy again. Although it has not raised its exchange rate to take advantage of the fire; at least it will let its currency value rise, so as to obtain some exchange rate benefits in addition to commercial benefits.</p>
<p>However, judging from the United States' position in international politics: the situation is just the opposite. Its jealousy of aggressive countries is not only due to its psychological love of peace, but mainly due to the necessity of maintaining its position as a world霸王 (overlord); even to ensure the perpetual development of its capital. Obviously: If Japan really defeats China in the Far East (which is not the case), then not only will it be difficult to maintain its vested interests in the Far East; its commodity market in the Far East will be seized by Japanese goods. Moreover, it will use China's rich resources to promote the development of Japanese imperialism. As a result, not only will the Pacific Ocean never be peaceful; but the security of the United States' eastern border, the Panama Canal, and even South America and Alaska will be threatened by Japanese imperialism. Because the expansion of Japanese power is the relative decline of American power. Therefore, the United States' sympathy and assistance to China's war of resistance is not only a sense of morality, but also its own sense of harm. To sum up the United States' Far East policy in one sentence: If it cannot completely eliminate Japan's threat to it, it must at least help China maintain a balance of power in the Pacific Ocean. As of today, its Far East policy, although its attitude is very clear, its actions are not active enough. It is better to say that it is doing "isolationist dreams" than saying that it is "waiting for an opportunity." What is this opportunity? A compromise between Britain and Germany or the expansion of the European war would be one of them. And now it's coming, that is, the expansion of the European war.</p>
<p>The United States' European policy is to maintain an unbiased balance of power. So it can agree to Germany's power expanding a little, but it also agrees with Britain and France's maintaining the current situation. Because this is not enough to cause the European balance of power to be lost. Under this principle, it is probably true that it is unwilling to get involved in the overly complicated European disputes. But after seeing Germany annex Austria and Czechoslovakia one after another, it has undoubtedly inclined to Britain and France psychologically and in terms of interests. Since the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the scale of the European war has actually formed; but Britain and France have not immediately taken a positive offensive strategy, but are planting chess pieces towards neutral countries. The war has spread step by step from Poland to Finland, to Denmark, to Norway, and Britain's emotions are becoming more and more tense every day. It is worried that if Britain and France do not rise up and attack quickly, then the result of Germany's continuous expansion of power will be that Britain and France will be in a disadvantageous position when the real European war breaks out. Undoubtedly: It wants to restore the balance of power in Europe. As soon as it discovers that Britain and France cannot support it, it will immediately participate in the war. But to participate in the European war, the first step is to eliminate the threat that Japan poses to it in the Far East. Now that the balance of power between the two sides in the European war has not been broken and the war has expanded due to the invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the United States can first provide economic assistance to Britain and France without having to immediately participate in the European war, so as to devote its efforts to solving the Far East problem. True: The attitudes of the Soviet Union and Italy are currently unclear; the United States still has some concerns in its actions. For example, if Italy joins Germany in declaring war on Britain and France, the United States' burden in Europe will inevitably increase immediately. But generally speaking: It is probably a set trend that the United States will first provide economic assistance to Britain and France, and at the same time take the prior elimination of the threat that Japan poses to it as a prerequisite. If so: The future of the US dollar cannot only be predicted from an economic point of view.</p>
<p>Before and after the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the exchange rate of the pound against the US dollar has been fluctuating. Because the interests of Britain and the United States are generally the same, it has long been estimated that the United States will inevitably stabilize the Sino-American exchange rate as a kind of assistance to Britain. This view is correct, but the timing is wrong. Because before the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were invaded, Britain's strategy against Germany seemed to focus on economic blockade and political encirclement. This strategy only hinders the interests and freedom of other countries. This is not what the United States is willing to agree to. Therefore, when Britain and France established a wartime currency agreement, the United States refused to sign another one, citing the fact that there was already a three-nation currency agreement before the war. At the same time, Britain is also willing to let the pound depreciate considerably to stimulate increased production in other countries, and even attract the export of goods from its colonies to Britain. Therefore, it does not want to interfere in the exchange market. Now it is different: In order to ensure its long-term war financial resources, in order to increase its purchasing power for overseas military supplies, it cannot deliberately let its pound continue to fall, and the United States, based on the aforementioned reasons, will adjust the British and American exchange rate level as a means of economic assistance to the Allied countries. This is also the most likely thing to happen.</p>
<p>The United States Congress has already established two resolutions: that is, to authorize President Roosevelt to implement foreign exchange control in an emergency; and to manage the deposits and all assets of war-torn countries in the United States on his behalf. If the first resolution is implemented, the freedom to buy and sell US dollars will no longer exist. At the same time, the United States must find a way to maintain an exchange rate that is suitable for political purposes for the currencies of countries with similar interests. The implementation of the latter resolution is to intercept foreign deposits to meet its political role: for example, intercepting Norwegian deposits to prevent them from flowing into the hands of Germans is an example. Then, is it difficult to guarantee that the funds that have escaped from Shanghai to the United States will not accept the Chinese government's request to intercept them, so as not to fall into the hands of the Japanese puppets?</p>
<h3>Market Knowledge Consultant</h3>
<p>Chen Jiejun's questions about the exchange rate and market conditions have been answered by Mr. Xu Bin. As for the currency system, please refer to my book "A Dictionary of Finance and Finance" (published by Shijie Bookstore). In general,</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Bin Answers:</p>
<p>(1) The Hong Kong-Vietnam market price refers to the number of Vietnamese currency received for every 100 Hong Kong dollars exchanged in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(2) If the Shanghai-Vietnam exchange rate is calculated based on the Hong Kong-Shanghai and Hong Kong-Vietnam market prices provided by Mr. Chen Jie, the calculation formula is:</p>
<p>This means that 100 National currency can purchase 29.9723 Vietnamese currency. However, Mr. Chen Jie indicated that the Shanghai-Vietnam exchange rate on the same day of the above market price was only 27 and 5/8, which shows that the calculation according to the above method is more beneficial than the market price in this city.</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Japanese Workers' Lives</h3>
<p>It can be said that the tragic lives of Japanese workers have always been the case; and it is even worse today in wartime. The reason is: the ruling class extends working hours as much as possible due to insufficient labor; although they formally provide increased wages, in reality, the increase in prices is far higher than the increase in wages. The following table is an index surveyed by the Tokyo Kongo Town Magazine, all based on the year from September of Showa 7 to August of the following year. The state of insufficient income and expenditure of Japanese workers is already very obvious. What's more, his so-called cost of living is still calculated based on the so-called official price, and private purchases are actually paid according to the black market price! Therefore, the tragedy of Japanese workers' lives must be higher than the level in the table below. (Unit: One yen)</p>

<h3>Money Shops Withdraw from Bank Note Exchange Starting Today 銀準會 (Silver Standard Committee) Stipulates Collection of Notes on Behalf and Revises Exchange Time</h3>
<p>In the past, in order to facilitate the collection and settlement of notes in the city's Silver and Money industries, more than 40 money shops from the Money Shop Reserve and remittance shops joined the Bank Note Exchange on July 4 of last year in the form of a commission agency exchange, which was handled by the Yin Ding (Silver Standard) Preparation Committee. Since its implementation, it has been quite convenient, and it is also a good method to improve the settlement of notes in the city's Chinese Silver and Money industries. It is heard that the Money industry has decided to withdraw from the exchange starting today, and restore the original method of the past, which is really beyond everyone's expectations and is incomprehensible to all industries. The joint circular from the Bank Industry Joint Preparation Committee is copied below. The original letter said:</p>
<p>"Now we have received a letter from the Money Industry Reserve, which roughly stated that "Since our bank has participated in the exchange, because it represents the entire Money industry, there are many establishments, frequent ins and outs, and the procedures are quite inconvenient. Therefore, the Executive Committee of our bank has decided to automatically withdraw from the exchange starting from May 13 and restore the original method of the past. We hope that your Committee will give us cooperation and facilitate the process." The current Money Industry Preparation Bank is acting on behalf of more than 40 money shops to participate in the exchange.</p>
<p>The procedures seem to be not without difficulties. The Bank's request to withdraw from the exchange has been approved by the Committee. It is planned to restore the original method of the past starting from May 13. All notes from money shops and outside banks received by each bank will still be collected by the Committee, and then the Committee will summarize and reconcile the accounts with the Money Industry Reserve. It has also been agreed with the Bank that the time limit for the Silver and Money Industry to return notes at the time of receiving notes is 2 hours before 5 pm. The time for the Committee to collect notes from the Money Industry and the Banks is now stipulated as follows, starting from May 13.</p>
<p>(1) Exchange banks should deposit notes from the Money Industry and other outside banks that are due on the same day into the Committee at the following times.</p>
<p>A. Notes from member money shops: Before 3 pm on the same day. Banks can directly collect from each shop between 3 pm and 4 pm.</p>
<p>B. Notes from banks, silver companies, trust companies, and notes outside the exchange bank: Before 2 pm on the same day.</p>
<p>C. Other notes from outside banks: Before 12 am on the same day.</p>
<p>D. Notes from foreign banks: Before 11 am on the same day.</p>
<p>E. Other notes from foreign merchants and outside banks: Before 10 am on the same day.</p>
<p>(2) Exchange banks should deposit various notes from outside banks that are not due into the Committee after 4 pm one day before the due date.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee revised the exchange times due to the gradual increase in the number of exchange notes in order to facilitate the collection and payment of the industry. It will also be implemented starting today. The details are:</p>
<p>A. Exchange time starts from 3:30 pm every day.</p>
<p>B. The time for depositing the notes entrusted to the Committee for exchange is before 2:45 pm every day.</p>

<h3>Woolen Fabric Inventory Greatly Hoarding</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of woolen fabric in the main market rose sharply, and all the inventory in the hands of wholesale households was hoarded. The reason is that the cost has suddenly increased and orders are difficult. After the bottom goods are cleared, it is feared that there will be no goods to sell. Buyers who want to purchase goods hold cash and ask from house to house. It is not easy to buy for a while. This special situation is rare since the woolen fabric market.</p>

The current market price of Ningbo Chen 蜅 (Chen dried small shrimps) is 545 yuan, and the asking price of Zheng Zhoushan 蜅 (Zheng Zhoushan dried small shrimps) is 190 yuan, which is extremely lacking. The bottom of the sea jellyfish skin is at 尙裕 (Shang Yu store), and its sales are gradually expanding. The recent transactions were 55 yuan for sea jellyfish skin and 45 yuan for jellyfish heads, and its momentum is stable.</p>
<h3>Domestic Dried Mussels Have Been Cut Off</h3>
<p>Domestic dried mussels, due to the reduced production last year, have caused the existing stock here to be sold out.

<p>New York Stocks</p>
<p>New York, 11th. Today's market: Military stocks rose. Other stocks mostly fell. Market conditions remain volatile. However, reports of stalled military offensives have calmed nerves somewhat, believing military stocks are still cheap, such as steel, machinery, and aircraft stocks. Speculators are overreacting to the loss of foreign income for some companies.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>New York, 11th. Rubber prices reacted as profits were taken on long positions. Shorts have apparently not yet covered. Dutch and Belgian ships are now collecting insurance premiums from belligerent nations. US merchant ships are not heading to the Far East.</p>
<p>US Wheat</p>
<p>Chicago, 11th. Wheat stocks are unexpectedly high at 460 million bushels. However, the large acreage remains a problem. Crop diseases are occurring in Taizhou, so the impact is still minor. Also, the Netherlands and Belgium are normally the largest food importing countries. Now, their involvement in the war will likely affect food imports. Whether this is beneficial remains questionable. The market is uncertain and will likely be swayed by war news.</p>

<h3>Commemorating Mother's Day: Exhortation to Serve the Nation with Utmost Loyalty; Shanghai's Women's Circles Elucidate the Profound Significance; Repaying Maternal Grace Requires Utmost Loyalty and Filial Piety</h3>
<p>Yesterday was International Mother's Day. Shanghai's women's circles, in commemoration, specially issued a public letter to women to promote and encourage them. They also sent representatives to various refugee camps to comfort the refugees. The letter to women is recorded below:</p>
<p>National Heroes Instructed by Wise Mothers</p>
<p>Today is the second Sunday of May, International Mother's Day. The significance of commemorating this day is because mothers are the nurturers of the nation's future vitality and the transmitters of the nation's future culture. A mother's responsibility is extremely important, and her work is extremely sacred. In ancient China, although women were looked down upon, mothers were always respected. The many great figures who achieved merit for the country and benefited the nation were all instructed by virtuous mothers. The examples of Mencius' mother, who broke the loom to encourage learning, and Yue Fei's mother, who tattooed loyalty on his back, are prominent examples. Commemorating Mother's Day in today's stormy situation has a different meaning than commemorations in previous years.</p>
<p>Encouraging Children to Be Loyal and Filial</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about (1) how to fulfill maternal responsibilities. Mothers should understand that they are raising children to inherit the nation's life and perpetuate the nation's culture. Therefore, they should not have selfish ideas about their children. From an early age, they should cultivate in their children the concept of loving the country and loving the nation, so that they not only become virtuous children but also loyal and brave citizens. In today's severe national crisis, every mother should follow the spirit of Yue Fei's mother, who instructed Yue Fei to serve the nation with utmost loyalty, to instruct and encourage their children. Furthermore, they should dedicate their children to the country and the nation to fulfill utmost loyalty and utmost filial piety. (Only in this way can they fulfill their maternal responsibilities.) Then, from</p>
<p>Glorifying the Nation and Repaying Maternal Grace</p>
<p>(2) how to repay maternal grace. From pregnancy and breastfeeding to adulthood, mothers have spent countless efforts and energy. Therefore, children should strive to repay their mothers and not regret "wanting to provide for their parents when they are no longer here." Moreover, mothers raise and instruct the nation's future vitality to inherit the nation's responsibility and perpetuate cultural responsibility. Therefore, children should understand this meaning and glorify the nation and promote culture. This is sufficient to repay maternal grace. In commemorating Mother's Day today, it is not only necessary to commemorate with rituals but also to commemorate with actions, recognizing that the nation is supreme and the nation is supreme. We must bring out the spirit of hard work, practical work, and quick work to make efforts. We are all mothers' children, and we are all children's mothers. We are willing to encourage ourselves and others and to warn ourselves and others to commemorate today's Mother's Day.</p>
<h3>Ye Chen's Troops Arrive Near the Outskirts of Shanghai; Chinese Army Liaison is Ready; Population is Being Evacuated Along Both Routes; Gu Fusheng's Troops Have Moved to New Positions</h3>
<p>In various places near the outskirts of Songhu on the Eastern Front, Japanese and puppet forces are actively harassing, proclaiming sweeps and purges. Encounters have occurred with the Chinese army's Gu Fusheng's troops, resulting in three days and nights of fierce fighting. The Japanese and puppet forces gained nothing and suffered heavy losses, with over 300 Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. As a result, they have gathered garrison Japanese and puppet troops from over 30 strongholds in Jiangnan and launched a large-scale siege. Fortunately, Gu's elite troops have close connections with the Party and government, and political training has been effectively instilled. Once a war is launched, they can use agile and courageous countermeasures to give the Japanese</p>
<p>A Head-On Blow</p>
<p>As a result, they are venting their anger on the people. They have followed requests from bandits such as Lu Fazhang, Huang Peize, and Lu Huiren to support the establishment of a puppet regime. Puppet Peace Army leaders Xu Dangsheng (i.e., Liansheng) and Jiang Ake (i.e., Yongchang) are recklessly harming the people to achieve their goals, resulting in an unprecedented massacre in various parts of the Shanghai suburbs for over 20 days and nights. Details have been reported in various newspapers. Upon receiving the report, the highest military commander immediately telegraphed orders to various routes to train new troops and successively move east, advancing along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Hangzhou-Jiaxing routes, occupying strategic areas, and</p>
<p>Evacuating the Population</p>
<p>Military transport is busy. Large-scale mobile warfare has occurred in Jiahu and various places in Danxuanfengnan in recent days. After relocating to a safe area, Gu Fusheng's troops are intensifying political training day and night and replenishing ammunition. They have been fully equipped and have successively moved to new positions to prepare for a counter-offensive. It is expected that once the various units are linked up, a large-scale counter-sweep will be launched. It is also heard that Ye Chen's troops, formerly part of the New Fourth Army, have arrived in Jiatatai County and have established close contact with the Chinese army in various parts of Pudong and Punan, and are certain to win with surprise tactics.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Wartime Enterprises: Existing Rights and Interests</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has previously promulgated restrictive measures for various enterprises in war zones or near war zones, stipulating that the transfer, mortgage, or alteration of the names of fishery rights holders and mining rights holders, as well as the names of forestry contractors, state-owned mining rights lessees, or those who have obtained special business rights, the transfer or mortgage of the sites and equipment of various farms, forests, pastures, fisheries, mines, factories, and companies, and other real estate, the transfer or mortgage of shares in various companies, or the change of shareholders' names, the use of company reserve funds, and contracts or agreements between persons in charge or representatives of companies or other enterprises and foreign merchants regarding rights and interests, must be submitted to the Ministry for approval in order to be valid. It has been learned that in the occupied areas, people are often tempted and cooperate with others under the pretext of returning private property. If they fall into their trap, they will lose their private rights and interests on a small scale, and affect the country's economic resources on a large scale. The Ministry of Economic Affairs reiterated its warnings, urging all business owners and company shareholders to strictly abide by the previously promulgated restrictive measures, and not to fall into the trap of evil schemes, to avoid future regrets.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek is Increasingly Supported by the People; The People Are Willing to Endure Hardships, and the Resistance War is Increasingly Firm; Philippine Reporter Discusses the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the "Continental Daily" weekly published an article by Mr. Nugen Lig, a well-known reporter from the "Philippine Free Press" stationed in Shanghai, severely criticizing Japan's war of aggression against China. The article first pointed out that Japan's methods of dealing with foreign relations are cunning and unusual. For example, the United States has protested to Japan for repeatedly violating international treaties, using inhumane methods to engage in war, and harming American interests in China. All protests list detailed facts. If Japan wants to defend these protests, it should expose the errors in the facts listed or explain the circumstances of the unavoidable situation. However, the facts are clear and do not allow Japan to conceal them. Therefore, its method of defense is unusually cunning. Japan repeatedly claims to be engaged in a "holy war" to establish a "New Order in East Asia." Under any circumstances, it repeatedly uses the slogan of "holy war" to deal with all protests. In fact, the so-called "holy war" is just another name for aggression.</p>
<p>Japan's Violation of International Treaties</p>
<p>Japan is one of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty. The treaty requires it to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to resolve all international disputes peacefully. However, Japan has reversed its actions and used force to seize the Northeast and launch a war of aggression against China. Therefore, its so-called "holy war" is actually an excuse to violate international treaties to carry out aggression. Therefore, according to Mr. Lig, only the most ignorant Japanese believe it. The so-called "holy war" is nothing more than a representation of various Japanese atrocities. There is no doubt that the Japanese people are not as aggressive as the Japanese warlords, and the Japanese warlords have given Japan an indelible shame. Since Japan has repeatedly used the mantra of "holy war" to respond to protests from various countries, and the United States and the world have known that it cannot be reasoned with, will they continue to endure Japan's insults? The powers should take effective action immediately to deal with Japan.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Isolation</p>
<p>Mr. Lig also discussed the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union in his article. Because Japan is in a state of diplomatic isolation, it is implementing an absolutely contradictory policy. On the one hand, it is eager to "adjust relations" with the Soviet Union, and at the same time, it declares to democratic countries that Japan is responsible for "anti-communism" in Asia. The Japanese side is using "anti-communism" as a smokescreen in an attempt to cover up its aggression against China. Japan's aggression against China has precisely promoted China's greater unity. Regarding the issue of Japan creating a puppet government, Mr. Lig said that the Japanese people are currently in a high state of war weariness. Therefore, the Japanese authorities have to create a puppet "regime" and conclude a "peace treaty" with it in order to alleviate the people's war weariness. At the same time, it can use this to exclude the rights and interests of the powers in China.</p>
<p>China's Strong Will to Resist</p>
<p>The Chinese people are currently suffering in the great national war of resistance. However, even though they are suffering greatly, it is not enough to shake their determination to fight for independence and freedom. On the contrary, it will further strengthen their belief in resistance. Chinese soldiers, including those who previously opposed President Chiang Kai-shek, are also uniformly under the command of President Chiang Kai-shek to participate in the resistance war. The united front is becoming increasingly consolidated. Those who defect to the Japanese puppets are all nameless local tyrants and evil gentry. The article concluded that the Chinese people will undoubtedly reject the puppet organization in the current environment.</p>
<h3>Although the Surtax Case Has Been Passed, We Still Request a Postponement of Implementation; The Price Increase Storm is Unprecedented Since the Opening of the Port; It is Deeply Hoped That the Authorities Will Consider Temporary Flexibility</h3>
<p>The taxpayers of the Shanghai Public Concession, Yan Ziming, etc., sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, requesting a postponement of the surtax implementation to alleviate the people's difficulties. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, the prices in Shanghai are soaring, and the people are struggling to survive. Since May, due to the tightening of the black market exchange rate, prices have reached their peak. Such a price storm is truly astonishing. Our citizens have become like fish in a cauldron, and it is extremely difficult to cope with daily expenses. Those who lack sufficient food and clothing are numerous. The serious situation is unprecedented since the opening of the port. However, the Municipal Council has increased the municipal general tax, special housing tax, and land tax by 50 percent, and it will be implemented on July 1 this year, adding another burden to our citizens. This is no different from adding fuel to the fire. The surtax matter was passed at the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers, and it is certainly inconvenient to cancel the agreed-upon decision. However, we deeply hope that the authorities will consider temporary flexibility and postpone implementation. We dare to request that your association forward a letter to the Municipal Council, taking into consideration the difficult times and the suffering of the people, and to discuss and decide to postpone the implementation of the surtax and find other remedial measures. We cannot express our prayers enough."</p>
<h3>Xiangtai Timber Company Labor and Management to Negotiate Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>To be Resolved at 10 AM Today</p>
<p>Since the labor dispute occurred at the British-owned Xiangtai Timber Company last Tuesday, the factory urgently needs to resume work. Therefore, it has repeatedly urged the workers to put forward concrete conditions. Although the factory manager, Kaolunsi, had reviewed the conditions put forward by the workers the day before yesterday, he had not decided how to deal with them. It is now learned that all the workers amended two of the previously proposed conditions yesterday morning: (1) The rice subsidy will be subsidized by the employer to the workers by 15 yuan per month; (2) All wages will be increased by 25 percent uniformly. Eight representatives elected by all the workers will go to the factory at 10 AM this morning to negotiate a solution with Manager Kao.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Suburban Disaster Area Refugee Relief Association Established; Fundraising 500,000 Yuan; Raising Funds for the Qinghu Road Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The disaster in the Shanghai suburbs has been ongoing for almost a month since the outbreak of war on the Qinghu Highway last month. The affected area has expanded daily and has spread to Qingjia, Shangsong, and other counties. The burning, looting, and rapine by the Japanese and puppet forces have not abated in the slightest. The scene is so tragic that it breaks the heart. Even the Ten Days of Yangzhou and the Three Massacres of Jiading in the Ming Dynasty are not enough to describe its cruelty. Even compared to the Nanjing Massacre during the withdrawal of the National Army, it is worse. In total, over 3,000 civilians have been killed or injured in this disaster.</p>
<p>Destroyed Rural Areas</p>
<p>Countless livestock, grain, agricultural tools, and other items have been destroyed. The areas around Guanyintang, Lujiajiao, and Liuxia in Qingpu County are particularly severe. Innocent farmers, regardless of the old, weak, women, or children, have been subjected to knife stabs, shootings, live burials, and drowning. Entire families have perished, reaching over 600 households. Nearby villages have been reduced to rubble. It can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe, a groundbreaking event in the history of the war of resistance. Now that spring plowing cannot be sown, the people are displaced and wandering, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, and have no home to return to. It is extremely pitiful. It has now been heard that Shanghai Suburban</p>
<p>Shanghai-Based Gentry and Merchants</p>
<p>Xia Tirenn, Min Ruizhi, Zhu Guoben, Sheng Shu, Zhou Yangshunwu, He Weiqin, Lu Xizhou, Zhang Xiuyun, Chen Xianyan, Sheng Langxi, Ding Qichang, Chen Xingruo, Sun Pengcheng, and over a dozen others have launched the Shanghai Suburban Disaster Area Refugee Relief Association, establishing an office in a certain village on Metters Road in the port. They are currently registering disaster-stricken compatriots and actively soliciting donations from all sectors of society. They will first handle emergency relief, entrusting Xinhwa Bank to collect and keep the donations. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been enthusiastically donating. However, according to the person in charge of the association, the disaster area is vast and the disaster situation is severe. It is estimated that at least 500,000 yuan in donations must be raised.</p>
<p>To Alleviate the Situation</p>
<p>In the coming days, it is planned to invite Chinese and foreign reporters to detail the current situation in the disaster area. Foreign reporters are also welcome to conduct on-the-spot investigations and publicize them widely. We also request that well-known figures at sea and kind-hearted people from all walks of life generously donate and benefit the disaster-stricken compatriots. The merit is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Promoting Trade: Symposium</h3>
<p>Reviewing Trade Issues at the Current Stage; Attendees All Had Incisive Discussions</p>
<p>Today, during wartime, although the environment for our country's foreign trade is difficult, its significance and hope are greater than in peacetime. The outbreak of the European war is even more conducive to exports. However, overcoming the environment depends on our efforts, and the arrival of opportunities should be used rationally. Moreover, stabilizing the exchange rate, balancing prices, adjusting the supply and demand of materials, and improving the people's livelihood are all closely related to this. In view of this, the economic journal department of this newspaper cooperated with the economic research department of the American Global Trust Company, which has special research on international trade. Yesterday morning, starting at 10 a.m., a symposium on "How to Promote Our Country</p>
<p>Foreign Trade" was held in the lobby on the fifth floor of the Bankers Association. All the attendees were experts in trade issues and backbones of the financial and domestic goods industries, including Wang Fuli from the Bank of China, Pan Hengqin and Yu Zhongkui from the Bank of Communications, Gao Shiheng from the Mechanical Industry Association, You Boqun and Lu Chuanlin from the Shanghai Bank, Yao Qingsan from the Jincheng Bank, Wu Yugan, a professor of international trade at Jinan University, Ke Tianfu, Bai Bingren, and Ye Qingjiang from the Overseas Chinese Bank, Nie Guangdi from the China Cotton Company, Xu Xiaochu from the Sino-French Pharmacy, Lu Zhixue from the Five Continents Pharmacy, Chen Yuzhang from the Courten Pharmacy (on behalf of Mr. Sun Guzhen), Li Zufan from the China Chemical Industry Society, Tong Hang from the US Consulate General, Lai Jihong from the Xinchang Foreign Firm, Li Shoulu from the Fuchanghua Foreign Firm, Gan Dounan from the Lixing Thermos Bottle Factory, Shen Leichun from the AIG, and Wang Haibo and Wu Wenying from the Global Trust Company, and Zhang Yifan from the economic journal of this newspaper, totaling dozens of people.</p>
<p>Lively Discussion</p>
<p>First, we discussed the relationship between international trade and the national economy. Then, we reviewed the trade environment in our country at the current stage. Next, we separately studied what responsibilities the financial sector, the domestic goods sector, and importers and exporters should bear in promoting trade. When discussing how the banking industry should assist domestic goods companies in handling import and export businesses, everyone was able to express their insights based on their own business experiences, which was quite lively. The gentlemen who attended had all just returned to Shanghai from inspections in the southwest or abroad. During the meeting, they reported in detail on the government's current trade policies and the various ways overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Welcome Domestic Goods</p>
<p>They reported on the government's assistance to domestic goods and industries and the efforts to dredge cargo transportation and develop international routes in difficult times. The entire audience applauded. Everyone who attended agreed that it was difficult to promote trade in Shanghai, but although it was difficult in the mainland, there were still ways to think about it. When a gentleman reported on the sales of domestic goods in overseas markets, the listeners were greatly excited. The records of this symposium, all of which can be published publicly, will be published in the economic journal of this newspaper as soon as they are organized. It is also heard that the economic research department of the Global Trust Company will publish a special issue of this symposium in the "Daily Economic Monthly."</p>
<h3>Changes in Dutch Shipping Routes; However, the Far East Will Not Be Abandoned; Java Lines Have Specified Berthing Locations</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the German-Dutch war, the shipping in this port and around the world has been affected. The Netherlands has no less than hundreds of mail and cargo ships, which occupy an important position in world shipping. Yesterday, reporters from Pingming News Agency learned from shipping circles in this port's Dutch businesses that there would be significant changes in all Dutch shipping routes around the world, but this would have to wait for the orders of the country's government today. However, the routes to this port and the Far East will not be abandoned. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Dutch Shipping Statistics</p>
<p>Dutch mail and cargo ships sailing on the oceans occupy an important position in world shipping and are also the country's largest enterprise. The Royal Netherlands Steamship Company alone has more than 200 mail and cargo ships operating in the eastern and western hemispheres, some of which also pass through Shanghai. The next largest are the Eastern Africa Line and the Java Mail Line. In Shanghai, they are all represented by the Java Company. Since the outbreak of the German-Dutch war, the mail and cargo ships of each company have been ordered to temporarily berth in the nearest safe area to await orders.</p>
<p>Routes to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the mail ships of the Shanghai Java Company, there are two routes. One sails to Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Luzon, Mania, Mengga, and Surabaya, and the other sails to Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Luzon, Mumbai, and Java. Each of these two lines has two mail ships traveling back and forth. Currently, the Zeni Canada is on its way to Shanghai and has been ordered to return to Small Luzon for berthing. Another ship, the Zhisanidan, was originally scheduled to arrive in Xiamen the day before yesterday and has also been telegraphed to return to Hong Kong for berthing. As for the Zhibad and two other ships that have already left Shanghai, they have also been telegraphed separately to inform them of their berthing locations. However, these ships are expected to resume sailing soon. However, there may be significant changes in the country's shipping lines operating in the Atlantic Ocean, as most of the ships will be used by the Dutch and Allied forces for transportation.</p>
<p>Sugar Industry Worries</p>
<p>The coarse and fine red and white sugars sold in this market, in addition to a large portion of domestic and Cantonese sugars to meet demand, the rest all rely on imported Dutch-made sugar to be shipped in for sale. Now that Germany has suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the Netherlands, the Shanghai sugar industry is deeply worried about the future of Dutch sugar imports into Shanghai. It has been learned that Shanghai sugar merchants have ordered several tens of thousands of bags of red and white sugar from Dutch firms in Shanghai. The ships carrying them are the Zhisadani and Zeni Canada of the Dutch Java Company. It has now been telegraphed by the head office to sail to Hong Kong. According to the Java Company, the two ships are currently still en route.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Establish a Medical University in Shanghai; Preliminary Implementation of Cultural Aggression; Kitao Taichi and Others Will Come to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Japan is carrying out its so-called "New Order in East Asia" in China, with many names and colors, and endless. Recently, Tsuda Shingo, the president of Japan's Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd., will establish a "Medical University" in Shanghai as a tool to lure Chinese youth. It is said that since the plan, after consultation with the authorities of Keio University, Tsuda's alma mater, he has received funding from Keio University President Kitao Taichi. The plan has become increasingly concrete. It is reported that the "Medical University" students are limited to Chinese students, and other foreigners are "not allowed to enroll." Kitao Taichi and others will come to Shanghai soon to search for school buildings and sites, and prepare for enrollment, so as to start school next spring. According to puppet propaganda, this move is also one of the "great achievements" after the establishment of the "new government." And Tsuda Shingo's purpose is to "vow to improve the lives of the Chinese people with Japanese medicine," which is very humorous. According to general observations, China had several medical schools with outstanding achievements before the war, such as the Zhenru Southeast Medical College, but they were all destroyed by the flames of aggression. This plan is to bewitch general medical youth, but its failure can be predicted.</p>
<h3>British and French Ambassadors Initiate Fundraising Play</h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, and Mr. and Mrs. Cosme, the French Ambassador, have requested the Sino-French Friendship Association to host the Shanghai Drama Society to perform "Wu Zetian" at the Lafayette Garden, No. 1315 Lafayette Road, at 9 p.m. on the 22nd. Ticket prices will be donated to comfort the British and French soldiers.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Federation Urges Citizens Not to Set Foot in Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Life Is Difficult, How Can There Be Surplus Strength?</p>
<p>After the war in Shanghai, gambling dens sprang up everywhere, and gambling became increasingly rampant. Citizens with weak wills plunged into them, often unable to extricate themselves. At best, they wasted time and money; at worst, they were ruined and disgraced, and even driven to suicide by their circumstances. Cunning individuals even took risks and broke the law, posing a major threat to social order. The Municipal Federation of Citizens of the Special District believes that at a time when everything is expensive and people's livelihoods are difficult, how can there be surplus strength for reckless gambling? It earnestly advises citizens to be content, abide by the law, work hard at their jobs, and not to set foot in gambling dens. Newspaper reports should serve as a warning. Those who have already gone astray are especially urged to pull back from the brink and turn back as soon as possible; it is not too late. The Federation also hopes that parents will strictly supervise their children, employers will supervise their employees, and friends will advise each other to avoid going astray and causing lifelong harm.</p>
<h3>Fresh and Salted Duck Eggs Exempted from Export Remittance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed that fresh eggs, preserved eggs, and salted duck eggs are ordinary food items for the people and are hereby removed from the list, exempted from export remittance.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Have No Geographical Knowledge, Unaware of Switzerland and Sweden, Swiss Nationals Detained in Tianjin, a Farce</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a Swiss and a Swedish national residing in Shanghai recently traveled to Tianjin for business and then returned to Shanghai. According to them, they encountered difficulties upon entering the city of Tianjin. When they arrived at the old Russian Concession wharf in Tianjin, they presented their national passports to the Japanese sentry stationed at the wharf. The sentry took the Swedish national's passport, examined it closely, and then returned it, saying that he had never heard of the country of Sweden. To his knowledge, there was no country of Sweden on the map. The sentry also told the Swiss national traveling with him that he had never heard of a place called Switzerland. Upon hearing this, the two men were quite frustrated. They returned to the ship and consulted with the captain. They then took a map and landed again, showing the European map to the sentry, pointing out that there were indeed Sweden and Switzerland in Europe. After carefully studying the map, the Japanese sentry finally allowed the two men to enter the city of Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Issuing Counterfeit "Currency," Japanese Merchants Oppose</h3>
<p>Strong Belief in Legal Tender</p>
<p>According to an article by economic expert John Ahlers published in the English-language Sixth Evening Post, the "new regime" intends to issue a new type of counterfeit currency, but this counterfeit currency is unlikely to be linked to the Japanese yen. Japanese people have long felt dissatisfied with the measure of issuing counterfeit currency linked to the Japanese yen in China. Judging from the past "performance" of the currency issued by the counterfeit North China United Reserve Bank, it has caused general Japanese people to feel greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>The Tokyo authorities currently believe that the decline in the price of Japanese yen banknotes circulating in China is caused by their connection with counterfeit currency. Therefore, if the issuance of the new counterfeit currency is linked to any foreign currency, it will certainly follow in the footsteps of the counterfeit "Hua Xing Piao." According to Ahlers's speculation, the new counterfeit currency will not be connected to any foreign currency, and its value will depend solely on fate. The most vehement opponents of issuing new counterfeit currency in China are Japanese trading firms.</p>
<p>However, under pressure, they dare not speak their minds freely. They believe that Chinese legal tender is still the best currency. Therefore, the Japanese business community in this city does not feel so-called optimism about the fluctuations of legal tender. The exchange rate of the Japanese yen against legal tender is the same as in April, and even lower than at the beginning of this year. Therefore, the Japanese yen clearly depreciates with the fluctuations of legal tender. The counterfeit North China Reserve Bank notes were once at the same price as legal tender in April, but have now plummeted again. Given such past experiences, the various experiments currently being planned are bound to fail.</p>
<h3>A New Gambling Den Appears in the Central District of the Public Concession, Operated by Chinese Nationals with Foreigners as a Facade</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a large-scale new gambling den was opened on Friday night in the central district of the Public Concession. It is funded and operated by Chinese nationals, but uses a foreign club as a facade. The two-story building is fully equipped with gambling equipment, and gamblers are gathering there. The closure of the gambling den at the Asia Club on Gordon Road a month ago automatically marks the beginning of the establishment of new large gambling dens in the Public Concession. The Asia Club closed after the conclusion of negotiations between the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities regarding the area outside the Shanghai West Boundary Road.</p>

<p>Ji Lu, a local woman residing in a bungalow at the intersection of Meizhou Road and Yangshupu Road, recently filed a petition with the civil court of the First Special District Court through lawyer Zhang Danping, seeking a divorce from her husband, Xi Lingen (also known as Ji Lingen). The petition states that Ji Lu's husband has associated with scoundrels, committed evil deeds outside, and abandoned his family. On January 22 of this year, he was arrested by the Public Concession police for theft and sentenced to four months in prison. Under these dark circumstances, the petitioner had no choice but to request a divorce through mediation. The court granted the petition, and Judge Zhou held a hearing for mediation yesterday.

When they reached the middle of the road, they became flustered upon seeing the car speeding towards them, hesitant to move forward or backward, causing the driver to be unable to avoid them, and violently knocked one of the village women to the ground, instantly causing her head to bleed and injuring one of her feet. The police summoned an ambulance to take the injured person to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Scared the Electrical Material Factory Owner Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dismissed Coppersmiths Sentenced</p>
<p>The Da Kai Xiang Electrical Material Factory at No. 946 Avenue Haig, was founded by Yu Zhangtian. The foreman Cai Fushun, and coppersmiths Lü Shun and Chi Xingsheng had all been serving for more than ten years. Recently, they were suddenly dismissed by the factory. For the sake of their livelihoods, Cai and others raised funds and organized another factory at No. 173, Lane 620, Xin Zha Road. Its machinery and other items were similar to those of the Tian Kai Xiang Factory. While it was being prepared, Yu Zhangtian suddenly received two threatening letters on April 10, attempting to extort 30,000 yuan. He reported it to the police station, and suspecting that Cai and others were involved, the detective dispatched them, along with Tian Kai Xiang employee Chen Kuanxin, to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, during the change of dates, it was added to the case that Tian Kai Xiang had previously suffered the theft of a large number of goods, and a warehouse key was found near Cai Baoshun, and that the factory that Cai and others wanted to open was similar to Tian Kai Xiang. Another lawsuit was filed against him for crimes such as theft and breach of trust.

<h3>Children Exploited by Bandits to Deliver Letters Demanding Large Sums of Money, Extorting 25,000 Yuan from Chen Taiyan, Seven or Eight Children Apprehended After Reporting to the Police</h3>
<p>Chen Taiyan, the owner of the Meiling Pharmacy, suddenly received a threatening letter delivered by bandits on the 27th of last month, demanding 25,000 yuan, instructing him to send the money to a small empty space on the left side of the trash can in Hong Deli, Zhejiang Road, Beijing Road, between 11:30 p.m. and 12 a.m. on the 4th. If he didn't comply, they would deal with him severely. Chen reported the information to the Old Gate Police Station.

Before long, an eleven- or twelve-year-old child came to the small hole and took out a pre-placed paper package, and was immediately apprehended by the detective. Under questioning, he eventually confessed that there were as many as seven or eight children involved. After the arrest, the mastermind was traced, but none of the children knew the name and address of the instigator. Since the detectives and the children were all underage, they were released and a serious warning was given to the families of the children, requiring them to supervise them well and not to be exploited by bandits. On the one hand, they were warned to keep the peace, and to be very careful, and not be taken advantage of by bandits. At the same time, they continued to investigate the main offender for serious investigation.</p>

<h3>Tragic Event: Only Son Falls to His Death While Cleaning Window, Woman Widowed for Eleven Years, Raising Orphaned Child, Suffers Tragic Loss</h3>
<p>Qiu Zhenrong, a young student from Wuxi residing at No. 11, Rendefang, Route Ghisi, French Concession, is eighteen years old and studying in the second year of junior high school at a certain middle school. When he was seven years old, his father passed away, and his mother, Qiu Yan (41 years old this year), supported and nurtured him by working as a seamstress. His mother now works in the galoshes department of the Greater China Rubber Factory. Zhenrong is usually very filial to his mother, so the two have been relying on each other. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, Zhenrong returned home from school. At 6 p.m., he climbed to the window of his residence on the second floor to wipe the glass window. He lost his footing and fell to the ground, injuring his head and falling unconscious. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 9 p.m. on the 10th. The hospital reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the mortuary of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. The next day, the prosecutor of the Second Special District Court was asked to come to the mortuary to confirm the cause of death. The body was claimed by his mother for encoffining. However, Qiu Yan only had this one son. She was widowed for eleven years, hoping that her beloved son would grow up to support her. Now, he has unfortunately died in a tragic fall. Not only is the Qiu family extinct, but Yan will have no one to rely on in her old age. Looking ahead and behind, deeply saddened by the loss of her son, she has fainted several times. Fortunately, she was awakened by those living with her. It is indeed tragic.</p>

<h3>Soybean Sauce Shop Afflicted by Fox Spirit</h3>
<p>Outside the city of Suzhou, at the beginning of Shantang West Road, across from the Hefeng Soybean Sauce Shop, there used to be a teahouse. It was rumored that a fox spirit lived upstairs. The teahouse owner supplied a cup of clear tea every day, and there was nothing else unusual. Since the soybean sauce shop changed hands last year and the teahouse was demolished and used as a screen wall, the shop has been constantly restless. Sometimes there is a sound of knocking on jars, sometimes a sound of hitting urns. Even when the stars and moon are bright, the sad cries of women can often be heard; when the wind and rain are cold, the sighs of travelers are suddenly heard. Those who live in this garden are all startled by the sounds! At the end of the year, the soybean sauce and fermented bean curd produced were mostly spoiled and unsalable.</p>
<h3>Pond Emits Red Light</h3>
<p>It is said that the lotus pond in Yuyuan Garden in the city suddenly made a sound of gurgling water at 12 o'clock on the 21st, and a red light shot up about five zhang high. At its peak, there were two objects resembling red lanterns. After an hour, it gradually disappeared. A Mr. Chen and his brother, who lived in Wutong Lane, witnessed it, and a clerk from a fan shop also saw it. All said that there was a giant snake in the garden, and this must be the appearance of a snake spirit, and the red lanterns were probably the snake's two eyes.</p>
<h3>Gas Company Distributes Profits</h3>
<p>The fire company in the French Concession of Shanghai is now distributing profits to the share issuers. Each hundred taels receives six taels of silver. In total, sixteen taels of silver were received last year, which can also be described as a moderate profit.</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<h3>New Life and Daily Living</h3>
<p>— Chen Nianyun</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to read "Essentials of New Life," and saw that it had separate regulations regarding food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Now, I will transcribe them below:</p>
<p>Food: Eating and drinking to nourish life is a great human desire. Eating should be at fixed times, and one should not indulge in gluttony. Utensils must be clean, and food must be pure. Use local products to prevent wealth from flowing outward. Do not get drunk on alcohol, and eat in moderation. Chew silently, and sit properly. Do not make a mess of bones or fish bones. At banquets and gatherings, yield to others before picking up your chopsticks. Pay attention to bacteria and avoid raw and cold foods. Banish opium and do not smoke cigarettes. Be ashamed of being supported by others, and support yourself.</p>
<p>Clothing: Clothes protect the body and are a symbol of etiquette. Do not follow trends, and do not be ashamed of simplicity. Styles should be simple and materials should be domestic products. Pay attention to durability, and housewives should make their own clothes. Wash frequently and mend tears. Fix shoe heels and fasten buttons. Do not wear clothes askew, and do not go naked. Take off hats and caps when entering a room for a gathering. Air bedding frequently, and pack light. Give clothes to friends and care for the poor.</p>
<p>Housing: A dwelling is a place to start a business and build a home. Enjoy family gatherings and be harmonious, not noisy. Get up at dawn and brush your teeth. Cut your nails, get a haircut, and bathe frequently. Use local materials when building, and choose domestic products. Do not dirty the walls, and keep furniture simple. Open windows often to allow air and light. Cherish every moment and work diligently. Be careful of fire and lock doors carefully. Do not accumulate garbage or leave dust. Keep the kitchen and toilet especially clean. Catch rats and kill flies, and clear ditches and roads. Get along with neighbors and plan public welfare together. Help each other in disasters, and vaccinate against diseases. Raise the national flag at home on national holidays. Respect the flag and the nation, and follow regulations when raising and lowering it.</p>
<p>Transportation: Transportation is movement, and it is also action. Behave with composure and walk in an orderly manner. Do not push when getting on and off vehicles. Give way to women and children, and support the elderly and weak. Walk on the left and stand up straight. Look straight ahead and listen attentively. Return lost items to their owners and greet acquaintances. Feel sorrow at funerals and do not rejoice at fires. Spitting, sneezing, and urinating in public are all forbidden. Obey the rules in public places. Leave meetings in an orderly fashion. Do not make noise or speak out of turn. Stand at attention when you hear the national anthem. Be punctual for meetings and be practical when doing things. Avoid excessive socializing and give up gambling.</p>
<h3>Talking About Dressing</h3>
<p>— Meizi</p>
<p>Whether clothes are cherished or not has a great impact on the clothes themselves. For example, two pieces of clothing made from the same material might break after a year if worn by person A, but person B could wear them for two years without them breaking. This difference comes from whether or not they are cherished. Of course, if you can cherish them, you can wear them longer.</p>
<p>Also, regardless of whether clothes are made of silk or cloth, cleanliness is the most important thing. Wearing a neat and clean cloth outfit is much better than wearing a dirty and wrinkled silk outfit. Therefore, it is best to take off your outer clothes in the bedroom, fold them neatly, and put them away. Do not place them on a stool or bed, because wrinkled clothes look very unsightly, not to mention avoiding the intrusion of dust!</p>
<p>As for robes, it is best to always use a jacket. There are many benefits to wearing a jacket. It can prevent the robe from getting dirty and protect the material of the robe, killing two birds with one stone. Why not do it? I remember in the countryside, nine out of ten people wore jackets. When attending wedding banquets or visiting relatives and friends, they only needed to take off their jackets to look like they were wearing new clothes. Unfortunately, people in the city do not approve of this, thinking it looks a bit like a country bumpkin and considers it shabby. But what does it matter?</p>
<p>Recently, clothing materials have become very expensive. Making a robe costs at least dozens of dollars. It really makes making clothes a big undertaking. So we must value our clothes more and take good care of them, so that we don't have to worry about making new clothes when the problem of living is already causing us headaches.</p>
<p>Secondly, turning up your pant legs on rainy days and being careful not to get dirty... etc., are all ways to cherish clothes.</p>
<h3>Small Talk</h3>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>Sometimes, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered the cooks to prepare a hundred different dishes for each meal, each dish served in a gold or silver basin, the shape of which was cast to imitate the actual food it contained.</p>
<p>Ancient Roman cooks were extremely skilled, able to cook a whole pig, half roasted and half stewed.</p>
<p>According to Dutch law, horse meat may only be sold by designated stores, and ordinary stores selling beef, mutton, and pork are not allowed to sell it.</p>
<p>In Rome, 200 years before the Christian era, there were explicit legal restrictions on the color of women's clothing.</p>
<p>British women spend 90 million yuan on silk stockings each year, while American women spend 350 million yuan each year.</p>
<p>The subways and elevated railways of New York City have nearly 2 billion passengers each year.</p>
<p>Britain spends 5 million yuan each year on manufacturing candy and employs 85,000 workers.</p>
<p>The number of automobile accidents at night is six times greater than during the day.</p>
<p>According to excavations by archaeologists, lamps and stone or mud torches were the first household utensils made by mankind.</p>
<p>In 1572, the first wristwatch was made and presented to Queen Elizabeth of England by the Earl of Leicester.</p>
<h3>A Wartime Menu From Paris</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xinfang</p>
<p>Since late March of this year, the Paris municipal authorities have issued the following restrictions and regulations on the daily food of citizens. In addition, all local restaurants and tea rooms must also comply with these regulations when serving customers.</p>
<p>Monday: No meat of any kind may be eaten.</p>
<p>Tuesday: All meats except horse meat are restricted.</p>
<p>Wednesday: The restrictions are on cakes and noodles. Pork, ham, and roast meat are not restricted today.</p>
<p>Thursday: Beverages without strong alcohol can be drunk.</p>
<p>Friday: Similar to Wednesday.</p>
<p>Saturday: All alcoholic beverages are restricted.</p>
<p>Sunday: Only today is the same as before the war. Citizens can freely choose.</p>
<p>Considering the situation on our isolated island today, although the prices of various foods are alarmingly high, we have not yet been "restricted," so we can still say that we are happy; and at least for most residents of this isolated island, this sentence should apply.</p>
<h3>"Travel" Safety</h3>
<p>—The Glory of Overseas Chinese Seafarers’ Service—</p>
<p>"Sailing a boat and riding a horse are three parts dangerous," this is an old prejudice and not enough to encompass the new century. Today, there is nothing that cannot be traveled, nothing that cannot be relied on human ingenuity to seize the workmanship of nature and further increase the degree of safety.</p>
<p>Reports say that in February and March, shipwrecks frequently occurred domestically. First, there was the "Ming Wang" ship on the Yangtze River near Xufu in Sichuan, which hit a reef, and then there was the capsizing of the Jingsheng ship outside the port of Zhenhai in Zhejiang. Each accident resulted in the death of hundreds of people. Domestic passengers lacked the spirit of calmness in the face of disaster. The shipping authorities were far away and had not made preparations for prevention and emergency rescue. It is no wonder that when disaster struck suddenly, they were at a loss. Now, I would like to describe the experience of Overseas Chinese seafarers encountering mines on the ocean surface, for the reference of those who care about the welfare of the masses.</p>
<p>The "Shell Concern," which controls the two major industries of petroleum and shipping, has long become a complex and large-scale economic organization, with ships of various sizes traveling to the East and West Oceans. There are no fewer than thousands of Overseas Chinese seafarers who depend on it for their livelihood. All ships are named after shells. For example, the recently bombed Phobos ship off the southeast coast of England is an oil tanker with a capacity of 10,564 tons. Thirty-four Overseas Chinese seafarers served on this ship, including fourteen sailors such as Ye Guoji, Tian Huanhuan, Lin Qixiang, Lin Xiaqi, You Yichun, Chen Yitian, Zheng Yilong, and Chen Yuanqing, twelve stokers such as Zhang Rihui, and Xie Zizi and other management personnel. Most of the injured were sailors, because when the ship hit a mine, the sailors were serving on the deck, and they had the most opportunities to be hit by shrapnel and collisions. According to a seafarer who was injured and recovered and discharged from the hospital, the ship came from Curacao in the West Indies. When it traveled north to the English Channel and arrived off the coast of England, it was detained for six days. On the morning of the seventh day at 6:00 a.m., the British authorities allowed it to proceed, and the ship set sail. The sailors took out the mine-sweeping Para·Vane and slowly opened it. Unexpectedly, before it was completely installed, the ship was hit by electricity at around 7:45 a.m., and there was a thunderous explosion. The ship was carrying asphalt, and black foam splashed in an instant. The Dutch mate, who was directing nearby, was killed instantly. A Chinese seafarer on the starboard side, whose work was not finished and could not run to the port side in time, had his face blackened and could not be recognized. When the explosion occurred, I immediately hid under the deflector to protect myself. Some held the deflector and dared not let go, and were seriously injured by the collision. Some had their mouths full of asphalt. The ship's authorities ordered the lifeboats to be lowered immediately. The stokers and managers on the ship were mostly eating at the stern, so it was easier for them to board the lifeboats, but I did not have time to climb on board. I immediately tied a lifebuoy around myself and jumped into the sea. After struggling on the surface for more than ten minutes, I was fortunately seen by the ship owner and was pulled into the lifeboat. The stokers, managers, and some sailors who had boarded the lifeboat earlier were reportedly taken to London, England, by the first Norwegian ship to arrive for rescue. Seven injured sailors, including Ye Guoji, were sent to the Rams-gate hospital by the shipping company. I and another more seriously injured sailor were rescued by floating in the water with lifebuoys and were taken to a Dutch port by a Greek ship that was diverted to rescue us and sent to the Sint Josepn Ziekenhuis in Vlissingen by the shipowner.

<h3>A Week of Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Alas! Under today's circumstances, where are there cheap things? Every day I bring two or three yuan of legal tender to the vegetable market, but I can't buy any good vegetables. How can I talk about the word "economic"? I am not a skilled cook, and when I encounter this kind of difficulty, I feel really棘手; I just have to do my best and choose things that are relatively cheaper to buy back. These days, the cheaper ones are cuttlefish, which can be bought for three for two jiao of auxiliary currency. As for the method, it is most flavorful to braise whole pieces of cuttlefish with pork or trotters; but the price of meat is too expensive, and I really can't afford it, so I should still buy shredded pork belly and stir-fry it with the cuttlefish. If you still think it is not economical, then replace the shredded pork with pickled mustard greens, and it is still considered a meaty dish, which can be used for meals.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Stir-fried Shredded Cuttlefish and Pork, Clear Stewed Fresh Ribbonfish, Braised Tofu with Crown Daisy, Mixed Bamboo Shoots and Lettuce</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Mother's Character (1)</h3>
<p>In 1908, Miss Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia, USA, observed the first "Mother's Day" to commemorate her mother. She believed that people would be positively influenced by this, so she launched a national movement to observe "Mother's Day." This idea gradually spread. Therefore, the US Congress passed a resolution, deciding that the second Sunday in May would be Mother's Day. Today, this "Mother's Day" has become a major international holiday. Besides Jesus Christ, the mother is the best gift God has given to the world. We should respect our mothers very much. Our lives are nurtured by our mothers. After birth, they breastfeed us, clothe us, carry us. When we are older, they teach us to eat and read. If we are sick, they are even more worried, personally feeding us medicine and not shirking hardships. A mother's love is truly the greatest and purest in the world, and we will never forget it. When Jesus wanted to teach the world how God cares for people, he held a lily in his hand and said, "Look at this lily—doesn't God care for you?" Today, we also want to take a fresh, clean white flower as a symbol of "Mother's Day." The white of the white flower shows purity, the shape of the white flower shows beauty, the fragrance of the white flower shows love, the growth of the white flower shows benevolence, and the quality of the white flower shows loyalty. Now, let us use the white flower as a metaphor and discuss the following five points: (1) Purity The white of the white flower shows the purity of the mother. Nowadays, some people embrace celibacy and never marry, thinking that they are particularly pure. This is not what God wants. Marriage is sacred, and forbidding marriage is also considered a moral degradation in neurology. However, marriages established according to God's will, such as mothers who do not teach their children well and abuse their children, can also become legal sins. Bearing and raising children is only a small part of being a mother and cannot be seen as the entirety of the mother's duty. To be continued. If you want to study in detail, please send a letter to PO Box 1227</p>
<h3>Teacher and Salesman</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiyao</p>
<p>Recently, some teachers have been taking a thick stack of books and peddling them to students during class. This kind of peddling is euphemistically called "introduction," but what is the difference between it and sales? Since it has the same nature as sales, the mission of a salesman is generally to use his glib tongue and social skills to make an ordinary product sound wonderful in order to attract customers and achieve his goal of making money. So should teachers do this kind of sales-style introduction?</p>
<p>Whether the books being introduced are worth reading and whether the price matches the content, let's not talk about that for the moment, but just from the nature of selling books: a teacher takes dozens of books into the classroom, and first has to say a few words like "a friend entrusted" and "the content of this book is rich," then asks the students who want to buy them to sign up, then collects money, pays money, and distributes books. This takes at least a quarter of an hour. After this quarter of an hour, how many people can concentrate on listening to the lecture? Most of the students who get the books will turn them over and take a look. Strictly speaking, introducing books to students during class is tantamount to wasting time and diverting students' attention.</p>
<p>In principle, I absolutely agree, but I am dissatisfied with the method. A young person with a strong desire for knowledge urgently needs teachers to introduce suitable extracurricular reading materials, but the reading materials being introduced must indeed be "worthy of the name." Teachers must never be motivated by commissions and introduce all kinds of heretical reading materials regardless of the consequences, and must not introduce entrusted books blindly. Also, what is introduced should at least be related to the textbooks, and the most appropriate and reasonable time for introduction is after class, or just have the teacher write out the title, author, and publishing house of the book and let the students buy it themselves.</p>
<h3>"Wage-Earning Class" and Shanghai Society</h3>
<p>— Chen Xinkui</p>
<p>Who are the mainstay of Shanghai society? Are they movie stars? No! Are they white people? Even more so, no! So who exactly are the mainstay of Shanghai society? To put it bluntly: it's the "wage-earning class"! The reason is very obvious: First, there are many people. From judges, professors, bank clerks, and shop assistants, to workers, tea servers, cooks, pastry chefs, old stewards, and young apprentices, countless people who work with their minds or bodies all belong to the "wage-earning class"! Second, the contribution is great. Thanks to the "wage-earning class" being busy all day long, the industries, commerce, schools, education, telecommunications, transportation, culture, publishing... and all other undertakings in society can operate and proceed. Everything from the dissemination of news, the buying and selling of markets, the transportation of vehicles, and even the enjoyment of the rich are the fruits of the labor of the "wage-earning class"! Third, the burden is heavy. Almost every employee has a heavy family burden, either with elderly parents above or with crying wives and children waiting to be fed. As a result of their individual frugality, millions of old, weak, women, and children can survive in this world. Fourth, life is hard. Except for a small number of senior staff, the vast majority of salaried people are extremely poor. Under the heavy pressure of prices, they can no longer talk about adequate food and clothing, let alone entertainment and enjoyment. All they have is hard work from morning till night, year after year. Regardless of rain, snow, wind, frost, severe cold, or scorching heat, they must go to "work" as usual. "Leaving work" will be punished, and "being sick" will result in a deduction of wages. They are as diligent as ants and bees, and they are as humble as ants and bees. When they are old, sick, or dead, they silently disappear from this world, leaving no trace. However, it is also shameful to say that people who have a career and are willing to endure hardship are said to be good citizens of the country, peace of society, and the evolution of the human race are all maintained and promoted by them!</p>
<p>Everyone is shouting that the purchasing power is weak, and Shanghai is about to collapse. Whose purchasing power is the weakest? Isn't it the "wage-earning class" with limited monthly income? Who is struggling to prevent the market in Shanghai from collapsing? Isn't it also the "wage-earning class"? Therefore, when the "wage-earning class" has to demand subsidies for living expenses, if the party with the financial resources does not sympathize and accept them, then if the last defense of the "wage-earning class" is breached, can the Shanghai market be guaranteed not to collapse?</p>
<h3>Clarification A Suggestion to the YMCA Boys' Department</h3>
<p>— Ding Yi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw Mr. Zhang's suggestion to the YMCA Boys' Department, and the points he mentioned have already been done. Now, I will clarify them as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Boys' Department has always had two bathrooms. Previously, due to the opening of a warm water swimming class, female YMCA members also participated, and the changing room was temporarily borrowed from the Boys' Department's second bathroom. It ended on April 5 and is now available for Boys' Department members. To avoid crowding, the Boys' Department stopped recruiting members last month.</p>
<p>2. Since the Boys' Department launched the "One Skill for Boys" program, the classes that have been opened so far include: typing class, electrician repair class, film projection class, wireless communication class, music class, English class, and equipment class. Most of them have already started.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Skies</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 23 Old Friends and New Comrades, Articles Have Value Famous Scenic Spots and Places, Well Managed</p>
<p>Mrs. Xue's factory initially had only 50,000 yuan of capital, which was put together by her little sisters. Later, it developed and her father added 50,000 yuan of capital, making it over 100,000 yuan. Huiquan Mountain in Wuxi originally had many toy stores, the most famous being the Big A Fu of Huiquan Mountain in Wuxi, which children welcomed very much. Because a kind of mud in Wuxi is suitable for making dolls, it is because of its fine soil properties. However, in the past, the manufacturing was too crude and did not meet modern needs, so it must be greatly improved. When Mrs. Xue initially started this factory, she invited all these toy stores to join, which was a cooperative in nature. She took the local clay dolls of Wuxi as the basis and added other improved toys. Such as wooden, celluloid, tin, and rubber, her factory also wants to expand. However, she is limited by the small amount of capital, and she does not want to develop in any way, but plans to gradually advance. The first step is to start with improving clay dolls, and each clay figure must have a good appearance. She spared no expense and went to Tianjin, Guangdong, and Suzhou to hire famous sculpture masters and apply scientific methods. Make sure that every clay figure is not only liked by children, but also loved by adults. In the past, the crudely made clay figures of Huiquan Mountain were all the same, and children liked them when they first saw them, but soon got tired of them. Slightly more exquisite ones were made into several plays, red-faced and black-faced people fighting, or licentious plays such as playing flower drums and eating vegetarian meals, which had a very bad impression on children. But the scope of clay figures is not small, and any kind of person can be made of clay. Mrs. Xue's factory first made a set of five races, with yellow, white, red, brown, and black human figures. Later, elementary schools bought them as specimens. Another set of social group portraits was made. At first, it was planned to make thirty-six kinds, which were considered thirty-six trades. But now, despite adding more, there are already hundreds of them. Thirty-six trades will be increased tenfold to three hundred and sixty trades. Among them are men and women, old and young. So that children can tell what profession the clay figure is at a glance. For example, a craftsman knows that it is a craftsman at a glance, and a postman knows that it is a postman at a glance, all of which are made vividly and lifelike. The clay figures for children are the most numerous, because children always like children, and various manufactured dolls have different forms. If they are made of rubber or celluloid, you only need to make a model and order them from various factories. Toy companies must have a new invention, come up with many new patterns, and create a new look so that children will be happy when they see them. These little toys can be registered with the invention bureau to obtain a patent manufacturing right. (275)</p>
