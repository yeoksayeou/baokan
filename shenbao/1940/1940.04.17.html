<h3>荷屬東印度羣島之浮動</h3>
<p>歐洲戰局之北向蔓延而及於丹麥挪威二國，吾人嘗稱之爲歐戰第二階段之初步；蓋丹挪首當其衝，而其直接間接之影響固遠逾於此一隅也。第一階段由交戰國之雙方，相持於馬奇諾防綫與齊格斐防綫之間。第二階段以德國之佔丹麥；侵挪威，馴主英法挪三國與德國作北歐陸戰與北海海戰，此爲新局勢之一；義大利緣是而表見其躍躍欲試之姿態，姑不問此爲軍事行動之先聲，抑爲外交折衝之解數，要未可漠視之爲無聯，終必爲影響大局之重要因素，此爲新局勢之二，比利時與荷蘭二國因感受嚴重威脅而促發之種種動態，此爲新局勢之三。即此論之，所謂第二階段者，既甚廣大而複雜矣，抑知猶不僅此。如巴爾幹半島方面之演變，甚應視爲未來局勢之另一環，而未列入第二階段範圍之內；範圍內之荷蘭，以所遭遇而竟有牽動全太平洋之可能，此實絕大問題而不容忽視者矣。</p>
<p>荷蘭侷促於歐陸之西北一角、面積不足一萬三千方英、里，人口不足六百七十萬人，介於數强，非惟不足爲鄰國‘之患，抑且幾乎不足與語自力以圖存，如此蕞爾小邦，宜無問題矣；顧乃不幸而際此强梁世界，竟因慢藏誨盜，懷璧其罪。蓋彼擁有宏敞富庶之殖民地，居然跨東西兩半球；以彼東半球之東印度羣鳥而論，面積大於其本國者五十餘倍而在七十三萬方英里之上；人口事於其本國者七十餘倍，而在五千萬人左右。茲乃於其本國岌岌可危之日，遠東侵略國之報紙異口同聲曰不能放任荷屬東印度云。如東京之英文日本時報者；其半官之對外宣傳機關也，昨日論曰：</p>
<p>「倘荷屬東印度，被歐洲任何列强統治，將迫令日本修正對於歐戰「不加入政策」明晰言之，倘列强將荷蘭捲入戰爭漩渦，日本或將加入戰爭：因戰爭結果，西方列强在遠東屬地情狀之任何變更，必須得日本完全同意，始能實施之。忽視此項原則之任何企圖，將顯然的促使日本修正不捲入戰爭漩渦政策。問題之解決，必須得日方之完全諒解，事實顯然。吾則，日方將不待任何人之諒解，或將有所行動。日本在太平洋政策，爲和平發展。日本對交戰國之態度，將仍照常，但日本新政策，將因荷屬東印度而有所變更，蓋此非舊例所能尅制之。荷蘭及日本對於太平洋和平發展，抱有同一觀念」。</p>
<p>其他報紙論調，頗有更嚴重於此者。在此歐戰之中，德因即使侵犯荷蘭之本國，但絕無侵犯荷屬東印度之可能，乃爲顯見之事實；故東報所論，絕非對付德國。試繹其意，實涵多義：其一，警告荷蘭，倘若德國來侵，母事抵抗，此其意在見好於德國；其二，荷蘭若抵抗德國，則日本視荷蘭爲交戰國，乃於和平或福利等任何藉口之下，置荷屬東印度於其保護之下；其三，恐嚇英法美，對於荷屬東印度不得覬覦經營；其四，爲彼傳統之南進政策，開闢路徑，企圖貫澈；其五，爲彼夢想之亞洲門羅主義，取宣傳上之攻勢，作非正式之公告。夫以日本侵華三年而憊疲竭蹶，若今日之甚，豈復能有爲於國際，此誠荷蘭朝野所得遙望中國抗戰之火燄而告慰者；然日本海軍中人久已坐視其陸軍在華之作爲，既不免於愛莫能助之歎，亦不免於用武無地之感，則垂涎荷屬，利令智昏，卒情小自禁而勃然突發，固不能斷言其事之爲必無；何况恰逢海軍軍閥主政，私以好大喜功之衝動，公以海軍南進使命相號召，是尤易視今日爲其絕好機緣；更因彼國在華之師老無功，士氣民心，頹唐憔悴，是由政治見地，謀所以恢復其軍民對於軍閥之信仰者，或亦以攫取荷屬東印度爲振作興奮之方；抑東印度羣島者，金，錫，煤油，橡皮，蔗糖，咖啡，菸草，金鋼石，金雞納，皆其大宗物產也，爲彼對華作戰資源計，爲彼財閥牟利計，攫爲已有，由經濟見地，亦有無上價値者也。</p>
<p>荷屬東印度羣島有華僑約八十萬人，其間如爪哇，蘇門答臘，婆羅洲諸島，尤爲一般中國人士所耳熟能詳；然中國固無侵略武器，且根本絕無侵略意願之國家也；誠使歐戰之在風駭浪，竟然波及彼方，中國自惟熟視若無覩。雖然，愛護東印度羣島者，有羣島之中國荷蘭；愛護荷蘭之擁有東印度羣島者，有荷蘭之友國英法美諸强。東印度羣島倘繼續其爲荷蘭所屬，則諸强在印度洋與太平洋之間，在亞細亞洲與海洋洲之間，必能保持其和平與繁榮；不屬荷蘭而屬之遠東侵略　，則諸强在全球東南部分之屬國以及其政治地位，經濟利益，軍事根據，胥將無異於一刀數斷，盡付東流。諸强若與日本妥協提携，和平友愛，則慷荷蘭之慨，以東印度羣島爲東南慕尼黑之祭品，必爲日本所情甘接受；蓋日本傳統南進政策所憧憬之成功，實以此爲一端。抑彼所期待如此成功者，原在十年二十年後，若乃不勞而獲之於今茲歐戰之中，則爲世界歷史之空前演變，非所謂歐戰第二階段者得與相提並論矣。</p>

<p>華盛頓　此間消息靈通者預料、如希特勒攫取荷蘭、則北美與南美諸共和國或將有所行動、以接收荷蘭在西半球所有之領士暫爲其保護地、據接近國務院者之意見、美國必不許德國對於荷蘭屬地要求所有權或主權、惟料德國不欲開罪美國當不致有此舉也、英國亦不致欲收管荷屬領土致觸美國之怒、（十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>日商華民輸觸礁沉沒搭客慘罹浩劫定海來滬途中遇暴風雨溺斃搭客至百餘人之多</h3>
<p>本市仁記路日商華東海運局經理之華民輸、於月之十三日、由浙東之定海載運客貨、啟骯來滬、不幸觸礁沉沒、遇難者達百餘人、為景昇輪沉沒後之父一大慘劇、據平明社記者訪悉詳情如次、</p>
<p>由定駛滬</p>
<p>該輸原名永安、儎重六百噸、行　時間已頗久遠、故船身早已破舊不堪、經公司當局於上月閒加以修理、改名「華民」、於月之九日、首决由滬開往定海沈家鬥、十三日下午四時、該輪又由定海沈家灣、載搭客三百餘人、貨物九千餘件、（計內有菜餅三千隻、炭三千二百簍、以及毛竹、鹹蟹、酒等甚多）、該項貨物、計重三百噸左右、是日（十三日）下午八時許、駛至金壇附近洋面、突遇在風暴雨、司機以載貨甚重、誠恐船身不堪暴風雨之襲擊、因迅將該輪駛至金壇大平山、希圖暫予停泊暫避、詎料因行駛過速、目風雨中視綫糢糊、不幸船身向大平山礁石猛撞、於是船底被裂開一大洞，澎湃海水、不斷衝入船中</p>
<p>海中及葬身輪中者、為數已近百人、倖得生還者、約二百餘人、一部份搭客、聞已被救脫險到滬輪上職員、亦有到滬者、迨至九時半、船身三分之二、已沉入海中、據悉該輸船長張某已失踪、該輪抬客之在滬親友及家屬得訊後、昨日有多人盼向該局探詢消息、據該輪局方面稱、華民輪發來之電報、極為簡略、僅證實該輪已觸礁、對於搭客有多少遇難、並無確切消息、又謂大部份之搭客、巳由安通輪救援、轉運來滬、定今日抵埠、</p>
<p>觸礁沉沒</p>
<p>此時船上全體乘客驚惶失措紛紛由船旁用繩索吊至岸上、情形極為紛亂、在乘客號哭呼救聲中、若干婦孺、均墮入海中、哭聲震入天、情至悽惻、事調查、墜後海中及葬身輪中者，為數已近百人、倖得生還者、約二百餘人、一部份搭客、聞已被救脫險到滬、輪上職員、亦有到滬者、迨至九時半、船身三分之二、已沉入海中、據悉該輪船長張某已失踪、該輪搭客之在滬親友及家屬得訊後、昨日有多人紛向該局探詢消息、據該輪局方面稱、華民輪發來之電報、極為簡略、僅證實該輪已觸礁、對於搭客有多少遇難、並無確切消息、又謂大部份之搭客、已由安通輪救援、轉運來滬、定今日抵埠、</p>

<h3>滬關稅警未給津貼個別規定無法理論</h3>
<p>財政部鑒於各地食價翔貴、生活維艱、為體恤各地海關關員生計起見、特頒發「戰時津貼」、無論關員稅警等一律四成撥付、茲據新聲社記者探得確實消息、江海關自塞財政部命令後、該關中外稅務司即集議發付辦法、結果、（一）全體關昌因係正式稅務學校畢業、決照規定付給、（二）稅警因係招考制、况非稅務學校出身、故暫不發貼、即照議辦理、關員津貼四成業已分別發給、惟二百五十九名稅警未予發付、顧全體稅警以財部頒發此項「戰時津貼」、並非限於關員、僅係滬關之個別規定、故頗為憤慨、第處此環境、亦無法與關方理喻、按滬關稅警月薪最高為七十元、最低為五十餘元、曾於去歲十一月、由財部核准按月增發米貼十四元、復於本年三月起、繼續增加米貼七元、昨據某稅警談稱、當局此種措置、確為顧念下屬、惟滬關竟個別規定、誠吾人所未料也、</p>

<p>各界捐款</p>
<p>亦稱踴躍、皆以為此種振齊、實惠均沾、頗多捐助、截至前日止、收有捐款五萬三千五百六十元、又紅　字會捐助麵粉一千一百零五包、但支出方面、買麵盼五千八百零六包、計國幣六萬零七百四十三元八角、製煮工費約五千八百元、外加生薑紅糖照料各項雜費、約二千三百元零本擬於本月初截止、因見平糶停辦、誠恐一時間貧民接濟同吿斷絕、故延展至本月二十日為止、最近每日發麵包約五萬七千六百餘只、需麵粉一百二十包、辦理至二十日截止、尙缺經費一萬餘元、該會以目下食價更非昔比、如社會人士熱心贊助出而維持、捐款不至斷絕、則繼續辦理、嘉惠貧窮、該會亦絕願為貧民而服務云、</p>

<p>紗　市狂風暴雨、使人可畏、現紗銷犛不弱、香港幫需要仍不斷乏、不過　朝猛跳、　額已鉅、當然有一度劇烈反動、惟大戶多頭、似不動生色也</p>
<p>現　紗晨開二十支雙馬漲風濃密、一開到一千五百元、而賣者依然寥寥無幾、再跳二十元、為－千五百二十元、廠單價為－千五百元、詎料價格猛騰後、一霎間、反動驟起、賣戶稍增、一挫幾十元、直跌至一千四百二十五元、廠單價曾到一千四百十元、價落時、不嫌價　者、依然活動拖進、重形回到一千五百六十元、廠單賈為一千四百五十元、查半日間成交統計五千六百六十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲二十一元、廠方由新裕廠開出二十支雙地球一千二百包、價為一千三百零五元　十支雙地球一千五百包、價為一千零三十元、今日有紗四十五件運廈門、一千九百三十五件運香港、玆將各幫口買夫之額量、分別如左、</p>
<h3>棉銷活躍　行情指日高升</h3>
<p>中　外現棉交易續見興奮、印棉生意愈形起色、故行情步步上騰、此因紗價太好、廠方頗有活動心思、加之歐洲局勢緊張、深恐來源或受阻得、所以現棉大為俏利也、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>

<h3>糧食　各物皆為投機籠罩　米價頓見非常漲風　一問存底…已堪維持至出新時漲風何來…追隨黃金紗布而起</h3>

<p>食麥致病辨（二）</p>
<p>有謂北方之麥，開花以日；南方之麥，開花以夜，性屬陰寒，病者而食陰寒之物，其中必滯。夫麥之花，至細極微，誰其日夜占中，而知其南北異性也。以天時言，稻芽於春，種於夏，成熟於秋，於四時僅得其三。麥則發種於上年之秋，而收穫於次年之夏，實備四時之氣，其和甘養人之功，斷不稍遜於稻。以地力言，北人種麥，地脈已盡，止能雜　他穀，以收其餘。南人穫稻，即於稻根壅麥，至春而犁分其田為行，夏而收，又復種稻，是其地可以兩熟，以兩熟之地所產者較之一熟之產，則南方之麥，豈不逮北方，而謂南人必不可食麥乎。更以物性言，大抵堅韌者食則難化，鬆軟者食而易消。然我嘗騐之人家造酒造醬，置麥於陰地，覆之以稻草，當四五月晴雨不時之際，半月即變其色，以手揑之，輙成灰粉。而造米粬者，必秋冬歷春，米擲水中始浮而不沉，然則物性米堅於麥矣。以人事言，磨麥作粉，以酒和之，能令粉蒸熟作鬆，高於原調之質倍半。亦有以蛋攪勻，和作糕餅者，他如饅頭亦然，若以油沸之，亦鬆脆不膩。而米粉則愈和愈堅，雖油酒雞蛋，無所施其技也。以此四者之功用騐之，食麥之與食稻，其易於銷化而不停滯者，誰謂米愈於麥乎。</p>

<h3>飯盒子的生活</h3>
<p>— 慈雲</p>
<p>一只價格從一元錢漲到二元錢的飯盒子，每天早晨盛滿了飯菜的帶出去，晚上空空如洗的帶回來，像湖絲阿姐樣的生活已經渡過三四個月的日子了。</p>
<p>早晨，在匆忙的時間里，將洗淨的飯盒子盛滿了將近三碗的白米飯，另外在一個半月形的槽里盛些菜蔬在內，把飯盒子蓋緊，用報紙包起來，這樣就是一頓飯的食糧了。</p>
<p>午時十二點鍾之後，將白飯用沸度的開水泡了二次，結實的飯被開水冲開了，菜蔬是冷冷的東西，就是這樣不用碗的用調匙盛到嘴裏去就算數，這樣填上了一頓中飯的食糧。</p>
<p>盛滿了一盒子的食糧的代價並不見得便宜，並且平添了許多麻煩的手續：在隔夜，家人特地把明天的飯燒好，安放着，同時燒好的菜蔬亦須另眼看待的安放着，防止發生酸性作用；到了早晨，把預備了的東西盛放在飯盒子里；到了中午，用開水冲熱，吃完了飯，還得親自的洗清。</p>
<p>講到代價又不見便宜，滿滿的三碗白米飯填下肚子尚不嫌飽呢！小菜嗎？不能太寒酸相，所以每天也得帶一點葷的食品；如果照這樣的佔計，每次至少四毛錢了。雖然嫌麻煩但價錢並不便宜，但是多少要比上飯店稱心一些，自家燒的小菜總是合自己底胃口。</p>
<p>每人從家裏出來，腋下挾了一句滿盛飯菜的盒子，懷着一顆卑下的心，好像隨時有被發覺秘密的危險，雖而在着熙攘的人行道上或者在　車公共汽車裏，隨時可以發現「同路人」，彼此之間儘可心照不宣，更在看到別人家穿了道地的洋裝亦挾了一只飯盒子的時候，似乎自己底不安的心，亦稍可安靜下來。</p>
<p>生活的尖銳的浪潮是普惠於一輩人們，最尷尬應付的　算薪水階級的從業員了，厠身於「士大夫」的階層裏，然而過的生活是太悽慘了，舉動行止須「士大夫」化，然而所得到的代價畢竟太可憐了。所以每天拿飯盒子吃口苦飯，也許已是算福氣了吧？</p>
<h3>所希望於業餘補習學校</h3>
<p>— 袁山</p>
<p>讀了「一年讀書有幾天？」和「一年讀書究竟有幾天？」兩文以後，使我們在補習學校裏的學生不禁引起了萬端的情緒。</p>
<p>普通日校的學生，雖有許多的假期要放，然比較上求學的機會還多；而補習學校的學生，大多數是職業界的青年，在日間勞苦地工作以後或在晨間或在晚間進補習學校去讀一二小時的書來滿足自己的求知慾，時間的寶貴不言可喻。按一般補習學校的每次授課時間大槪是五十分鍾，加之星期六多數是無課的，故再要像普通日校的一樣的放起假來，那末一學期的所得，實在是寥寥無幾。所以希望所有的補習學校除星期日停課外，其餘的能够照常上課。</p>
<p>再有一點也是提起的，大槪補習學校裏的敎師是兼職佔多數，其能準時到校授課的，固不乏人；然每有遲到五分鍾或十分鍾的，亦非少數，這樣在學生豈不是又要受到損失了嗎？故願補習學校裏的敎師設如因他事而不能準時到校的，則不要躭誤人家的時間而自動引退的好。這樣雖然少了一筆收入，然而心裏可以免得受責。</p>
<p>上述二點是我們明切望於一般業餘補習學校的當局能積極改善的。</p>

<p>何儷玉道：廣告上是一　大收入，而發行上倘再獲盈餘，那不是新聞事業，倒可以兩面進賬嗎？瞿無雙道：「但是我們報館裏，在發行上是可以獲利而不獲利。爲什麼呢？道又是一種規定。紙張旣規定至多是出四大張，而售價也規定至多是五分。倘然是售五分，我們在發行上，，早就獲有盈餘了。但我們還只售四分，因爲報紙是文化事業，求其普及於全國。而吾國是一個新興之國，國民力求節約，購置力並不充足，自然要省一分是一分。從前我們出三張時，售三分，現在出四張時，售四分。好在廣告上旣有收入，也儘有盈餘。不過我們的盈餘，全是供報館擴充之用。不是現在國家制定一種法律嗎？無論那一種工商業，除去開支，只能盈餘百分之十。但倘然是在事業擴展上，那倒可以的，尤其是屬於文化事業。所以我們是把每年盈餘，全放在擴展事業上的。」吳君素道：那末報館的收入，全靠廣告與發行兩大類嗎？瞿無雙道：「不！我們還有副業。這副業裏分出兩大部來，一大部是屬於刊物的，一大部是屬於非刊物的。屬於刊物的一部分，我們所出的期刊，自週刊以至於季刊止，共有千餘種。君素姊有許多想已見過的了。此外還有所出的書籍，以及從日報，雜志中抽出來單行本的小說，戲劇等等。而地圖一項，每年所出的很不少。世界地圖，全國地圖，分省地圖，分縣地圖，可謂層出不窮。而地圖那樣東西，以愈新者愈貴。從前吾們中國，出了一張地圖以後，永遠不變換的了，很爲可笑。現在我們每年必將各種地圖，審查修改一次，新修改的地圖一出版，舊的地圖就只好告退了，藏到圖書博物館裏去了。所以即使是新修改的地圖，也不能多印，只可以就一年中所需要的印出，防的到明年雙必須修改。可是就這樣說起來，每年所需要的地圖，常常使我們來不及印劇。君素姊！你想想！近來吾國敎育發達，單單大中小各學校裏面，要多少地圖，其他的機　，就不必說了。難道現在地　敎師，還能把舊地圖，指點給學生們看嗎？」正是：</p>

<h3>求業的黑幕</h3>
<p>— 前車</p>
<p>最近在各報上看到許多揭發求業的黑幕，其所用的「手法」雖不同，如招考職員，徵求合作等等，但其惟一條件，是在騙取保證金，或股款。在失業的浪潮里，他們在「求業心切」的失業者身上壓榨，僅僅揭發，徒然刺激他們想出更巧妙的方法來欺騙後來的可憐者，應該親自將經過情形向兩租界警務處報告，而對於那些「花言巧語」的廣告，我認爲兩租界當局應添設專門負責人的，在發現有懷疑的「招考職員」，或「徽求合股」的廣告時，馬上實地調查，不容他們有「一日一遷」的機會。</p>
<p>同時對於「求業心切」的朋友們進一言，抓住機會當然是你們的第一課，不過怎樣可以避免上當呢，這是應靜下心來細細想一想的。譬如這找到了一條「招考職員」的廣告，你先得注意那是什麼「行」，「商」，「廠」；地址在甚麼地方；牠所招考的是那一種職員；酬報與這職位的比例如何？如果發現有某一點懷疑時，不妨前去實地調查，假使是一家殷實可靠廠商，決不會「一塊木質的招牌」，「寫字間里雜亂異常」，或者「那出來的職只像流氓那樣的兇相」，等到一切都相當滿意之後，第二步該注意報名費要多少，考試時的課卷如何？……一個騙局是多少能够使細心的人找出一點破綻來的</p>
<p>「求業心切」的朋友們，不要以爲我的話是「馬後砲」，牢記着這些至少對於你們是沒有害處的；而且，即使是「馬後砲」，「亡羊補牢」也是可寶貴的敎訓呢！</p>
<h3>「平賣」</h3>
<p>— 片末</p>
<p>（上略）「平賣煤球，……每天供給一千五百擔。」這是多麼好聽而動人的善舉啊！但是大家如果按實際情形想一想，也就可以看出他們是如何的在弄玄虛了！平賣煤球現在是每人限購三角，計五斤半，那末一百斤便是將近六元，這價格是否便宜，姑且不論；若照他們平賣的規則，每家每日衹准購煤五斤半，那末在十天的限期內，即使有人天天化了時間去買，也不過買到五十五斤煤球，費了十天工夫，所便宜的不過五角錢，這與七塊錢一擔，送力在內的時價，相差有多少呢？</p>

<p>耶蘇同着他的門徒，在耶路撒冷一間小房子裏聚晚餐；雖則他們多不大明白事實是怎樣，但就耶蘇的事業和這一羣人的前途說，這個時候，實在是很危險的時候。他們在一塊兒聚餐，這一次。要算最後一次。此刻他們要下大決心，選定一條困苦的道路去走。耶蘇好比站立在布道工作的十字路上，他明知前面擺着的，是十字架，是恥辱的表記，是處治罪人的方法，凡知自愛的人，決不願忍受的。况且，耶蘇不曾爲非作歹口不說欺騙的話，他服務社會三年，帶給平民以大喜信息，使瞎子看見，使凡傷心的人，都得蒙安慰。他爲何要受十字架的酷刑呢？這裏面有一個道理，就是藉此可以使億萬生靈，得着幸福，並表明慈愛的大父，是怎樣愛他的子民。被打十字架已經是屈辱到萬分。在被釘之前，且須忍受種種侮辱，這就人情說，真是難堪，然而耶蘇怎樣呢？他拿起杯來說謝了。」據他自己說，杯代表一切當受的痛苦。這樣說來，耶蘇的感謝槪念，與我們的大不相同。大多數人的感謝，是自己慶賀自己物質上的成功，例如法利賽人，在聖殿裏感謝上帝，他超人一等，財主感謝上帝，因他倉庫滿盈，足够多月食用。他們沒有感謝的意識，對人也無責任心。比較的說，一個人物質上得了成功。易起感謝之心，尤易生滿足茍安之念。世上最可憐的人，就是那不費力而得了意外之財，自覺滿意的說，「我的倉庫滿了，我可慷慨一點，奉獻些許給上帝。」像這樣的人，世上確是很多很多。（待續）</p>

<h3>「獨腳電影」的新表演</h3>
<p>— 維特</p>
<p>我們知道上海的游藝界裏，有唱獨腳戲者，這是一個人的指手劃腳的表演。現在美國紐約的世界博覽會中，竟有一個人在表演電影，無以名之，叫它謂「獨腳電影」，這個玩意兒倒也很新鮮的，現在把它介紹於下：</p>
<p>叫一個表演的人（不是電影明星也可能），坐在一間小室中，　强烈的弧光燈向他面部發射，面孔的（像）由一傾斜平面鏡反射，經過聚光鏡和放大鏡，達到兩面較大的平面鏡，最後一平面鏡將「像」反向到小小的一片銀幕上，觀眾就可以看出這表演人面部的各種表情，甚至這表演人的說話，唱歌都可以讓另外裝着的一架微音器拾取，再由揚聲器傳布給觀眾的耳朵裏，好像叫觀眾欣賞有聲電影一般，據發明人赫且夫特（William　Hevrehaft）說：這電幕上映出來的「像」，可比原形放大三十倍哩。</p>
<h3>國際兒童音樂比賽</h3>
<p>— 楫</p>
<p>——中國四小友有得標希望</p>
<p>「國際兒童音樂比賽」這個名詞在上海是很難聽得的。大概在一月以前，上海青年會少年部曾舉辦了一次「全國兒童音樂比賽」，參加比賽的兒童共有四十人之多，飲食鋼琴的琴歌唱三項，　八仙橋該會大禮堂賽了一次，音樂雷台　。結果幾位有特殊的小藝人經十數　音樂名家一致評定為優勝者，得到獎品。</p>
<p>現在，靑年會再接再厲，預備在五月中旬再來一次「國際兒童音樂比賽」。　據說，這次比賽賽　資格的限　很嚴厲的，　代中國兒童的便是上次比賽的優勝者，至於其他國籍邀請的，否　都在被擯之列。</p>
<p>這個比賽委員會都是　上的音樂名家和名教授所組織。他們已決定邀請二十位左右的賽員參加比賽，節目仍分三項，　鋼琴提琴歌唱等。</p>
<p>這次比賽，中國兒童參加鋼琴一項　巫漪麗張易安王芝　胡悠蒼四伶，巫漪麗年齡最小，是上次比賽的冠軍，李博文夫人的高足，這次預備彈Chopin的Minnet　Waltz，（就是「淸平樂」一片十一個幼齡女孩所彈的）。此外張易安王芝蘭胡悠蒼則是名鋼琴教授查哈羅夫和丁善德先生，等的高足。他們在這次比賽中都很有希望，大可為國人揚眉吐氣。參加擔的柳仲箎彈Concerto，這在兒童中是很少見的。至於參加歌唱的梁知用梁林凱也有其　長之天才。</p>
<p>在比賽的那一天，全滬華人的精銳，將合組一大規模的交響樂隊，　黃永熙君指揮，演奏海登第一〇四交響樂曲，恐怕也是本年度上海音樂界的一個大收穫。</p>
<p>地　大概在中靑禮堂。　（外傳在　靑，實誤。）</p>

<p>毛世來　世來前次來滬紅極一時，　次同來之鬚生，為遲世恭，遲為老伶工遲子俊之文孫，家學淵源，藝頗不弱。世來得世恭為配，必收牡丹綠葉之效。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>戰太平的華雲是花雲之誤（中）</p>
<p>不佞鑑于「戰太平」一劇之已為顧曲所習聞屢見，不似從前打入開鑼戲時之不為時重，故特將若干年來凡演該劇的名伶有把劇中主角「花雲」唱作「華雲」的這種錯誤，舉出來更正一下，以免一直訛傳下去，遺誤後學。</p>
<p>按史書所戰，明明是說花雲從朱文信守備太平城，可見花雲是有這個人的，而且又是元末明初有名的大將，「戰太平」這　戲既是極意表彰他的忠勇，倘若連他的姓氏都弄不清楚，這未免太對不住當初編排此劇的前輩先生。我想最初唱這戲的名伶，一定不會把花華兩字弄錯，不過後來伶界人識字者少，科班的教師說戲又係口授指傳，戲詞說不曉得怎麼講解，字的陰陽，更沒人懂得，唱時但圖易於出口，祇想賣嗓子，冀博得彩聲，陰陽顛倒，誰還管得，劉鴻聲就是犯了這種毛病，所以始終不能稱為頭等名伶，識家只是讚他一聲嗓音嘹亮而已，至於他滿口京字，向不解「以字行腔」之法，這與現在浪得虛名的某鬚生隨便唱什麼戲都是「一道湯」的味兒是如出一轍的。「戰太平」的「將花雲」三字，唱時特別提高，的確這是賣嗓子地方，尤其是把「花」字唱成陽平，以「華」字音出之，比「將」字還要翻高，倒是容易響堂而不甚費力的。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fluidity of the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>The northward spread of the European war and its impact on Denmark and Norway has been described by us as the preliminary stage of the second phase of the European war; Denmark and Norway are the first to bear the brunt, and their direct and indirect influence extends far beyond this corner. In the first phase, the belligerents faced each other between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. In the second phase, Germany occupied Denmark and invaded Norway, leading to the Northern European land war and the North Sea naval war between Britain, France, Norway and Germany, which is one of the new situations; Italy seized the opportunity to show its eagerness to try, regardless of whether this is the prelude to military action or the solution to diplomatic negotiations, it cannot be ignored as irrelevant, and will eventually be an important factor affecting the overall situation, which is the second of the new situations, and the various trends triggered by Belgium and the Netherlands due to serious threats are the third of the new situations. From this point of view, the so-called second phase is already very broad and complex, but it is still not limited to this. For example, the evolution of the Balkan Peninsula should be regarded as another link in the future situation and not included in the scope of the second phase; the Netherlands within the scope, due to its encounter, has the possibility of affecting the entire Pacific Ocean, which is a huge problem that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is located in the northwest corner of the European continent, with an area of less than 13,000 square miles and a population of less than 6.7 million. Surrounded by several powers, it is not only not a threat to its neighbors, but also almost insufficient to talk about self-reliance for survival. Such a small country should have no problems; but unfortunately, it is in this world of bullies, and it is because it is slow to hide its treasures that it is guilty of possessing jade. It has vast and rich colonies, straddling the eastern and western hemispheres; taking its East Indies in the eastern hemisphere as an example, its area is more than 50 times larger than its home country, at more than 730,000 square miles; its population is more than 70 times larger than its home country, at about 50 million. Now, on the day when its home country is in danger, the newspapers of the Far East aggressor state say in unison that the Dutch East Indies cannot be allowed to be let alone. For example, the English-language Japan Times of Tokyo is its semi-official foreign propaganda organ. Yesterday, it said:</p>
<p>"If the Dutch East Indies is ruled by any European power, it will force Japan to revise its "non-intervention policy" towards the European war. To put it clearly, if the powers drag the Netherlands into the vortex of war, Japan may join the war: because as a result of the war, any change in the situation of the Western powers' territories in the Far East must be implemented with Japan's full consent. Any attempt to ignore this principle will obviously prompt Japan to revise its policy of not getting involved in the vortex of war. The solution to the problem must be fully understood by the Japanese side. The fact is obvious. Otherwise, the Japanese side will take action without anyone's understanding. Japan's policy in the Pacific is peaceful development. Japan's attitude towards the belligerents will remain the same, but Japan's new policy will change due to the Dutch East Indies, because this is not something that can be controlled by old precedents. The Netherlands and Japan share the same concept for the peaceful development of the Pacific."</p>
<p>Other newspapers' arguments are even more serious than this. In this European war, Germany can even invade the Netherlands' home country, but there is absolutely no possibility of invading the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, what the Eastern newspaper said is by no means to deal with Germany. If you examine its meaning, it actually contains multiple meanings: first, warning the Netherlands, if Germany invades, do not resist, this is to ingratiate itself with Germany; second, if the Netherlands resists Germany, Japan regards the Netherlands as a belligerent country, and under any pretext such as peace or welfare, places the Dutch East Indies under its protection; third, threatening Britain, France, and the United States, and they must not covet the management of the Dutch East Indies; fourth, opening up a path for its traditional southward policy, attempting to implement it; fifth, taking the propaganda offensive for its dreamed-of Asian Monroe Doctrine, and making an unofficial announcement. Japan has been exhausted after three years of invading China. If it is as serious as it is today, how can it have anything to do with the international community? This is what the Netherlands and the public can remotely look at the flames of China's resistance and find comfort. However, people in the Japanese Navy have long watched the actions of its army in China, and they cannot help but sigh that they cannot help, and they cannot help but feel that there is no place to use force. Then, coveting the Dutch possessions, the greed of profit makes them lose their minds, and they cannot help but burst out suddenly. It cannot be said that this matter is definitely impossible; what's more, it just happens to be the naval warlords who are in power, privately calling for the impulse to be ambitious, and publicly calling for the naval southward mission, which is even more easy to regard today as their excellent opportunity; moreover, because their country's army in China has been ineffective and the morale of the army and the people is depressed, from a political point of view, those who seek to restore the faith of their soldiers and civilians in the warlords may also take seizing the Dutch East Indies as a way to revitalize and excite; moreover, the East Indies are rich in gold, tin, oil, rubber, sugar cane, coffee, tobacco, diamonds, and quinine, all of which are their major products. For the sake of their resources for the war against China, and for the sake of their financial groups making profits, seizing them as their own, from an economic point of view, is also of supreme value.</p>
<p>There are about 800,000 overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, among which the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo are especially well-known to the general Chinese people; however, China has no aggressive weapons, and it is fundamentally a country with no aggressive intentions at all; if the storm of the European war really spreads to that place, China will naturally turn a blind eye. However, those who love the East Indies have the Chinese and Dutch of the islands; those who love the Netherlands' possession of the East Indies have the strong friends of the Netherlands, Britain, France, and the United States. If the East Indies continues to belong to the Netherlands, the powers will be able to maintain peace and prosperity between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and between Asia and Oceania; if they do not belong to the Netherlands but to the Far East aggressor, then the powers' dependencies in the southeastern part of the world, as well as their political status, economic interests, and military bases, will be no different from being cut off at once and completely paid to the east. If the powers compromise and cooperate with Japan, and maintain peace and friendship, then giving the Dutch the East Indies as a sacrifice for the Southeast Munich will surely be accepted by Japan with pleasure; the success that Japan's traditional southward policy has been dreaming of is actually based on this. Moreover, what they expect such success is originally in ten or twenty years, but if they can obtain it without labor in this European war, it will be an unprecedented evolution in world history, which cannot be compared with the so-called second stage of the European war.</p>
<h3>If the Dutch East Indies Undergoes Changes, the US Government Will Not Stand Idly By; Arita's Statement Appears to Be a Probe; Both the US and the Netherlands Express Grave Concern</h3>
<p>Washington - Official circles here are paying close attention to Japan's advocacy of taking so-called "protective measures" to "ensure the safety" of the Dutch East Indies. They believe that such a claim by Japan constitutes a grave threat to the US's imports of rubber and tin. Some officials stated that Foreign Minister Arita's remark that Japan is extremely concerned about any European war situation that could affect the Dutch East Indies is also a "trial balloon" to gauge the attitudes of various governments. On the other hand, they say that Japan's attempt to occupy the Dutch East Indies is one of its main objectives in expanding its power in the East Asian continent. They believe that although Arita's statement did not explicitly state that Japan would control the Dutch East Indies, it is, in essence, a carefully worded declaration of a policy of excluding foreign interests in the East. Judging from Japan's past statements before extending its power to Korea, Manchuria, and North China, this statement is a sign of an attempt to control the Dutch East Indies. They also believe that Britain will strongly condemn Japan's actions. The United States has repeatedly denied joint plans with Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries to defend the Dutch East Indies and other parts of Asia. However, officials do not deny that the United States is extremely concerned about maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, as the Dutch East Indies is a producer of various essential military supplies and raw materials needed by the United States. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources here anticipate that if Hitler seizes the Netherlands, the republics of North and South America may take action to take over all Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere as a temporary protectorate. According to those close to the State Department, the United States will not allow Germany to claim ownership or sovereignty over Dutch territories, but it is expected that Germany, not wanting to offend the United States, will not take such action. Britain is also unlikely to want to take over Dutch territories, incurring the wrath of the United States. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague - According to "Southern Daily," the Netherlands' policy of independence and neutrality applies equally to the home country and its territories, as the Dutch Empire is indivisible. We will resist aggression with our own strength and decide which country to request assistance from. Anyone who requests "protection" for the Netherlands, whether in Europe or the Far East, will be regarded as an aggressor. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague - Yesterday, the London "Times" published two dispatches from Washington and Tokyo. The report from Washington stated, "Among the neutral countries in Europe, not only Denmark but also the Netherlands have overseas colonies. US military personnel believe that the Netherlands' position is very dangerous, and the future of the Dutch East Indies, in particular, will force the US government to make a swift decision." The report from Tokyo stated that if Britain only maintains normal control over the Dutch East Indies without endangering the political status of the Dutch East Indies and Japan's interests, Japan will not object. If the Netherlands is forced to join the European war, Japan will take measures to protect its interests. (Haitong News Agency, 16th) The Hague - The crisis in the Netherlands and the problem of the Dutch East Indies have suddenly become the focus of world attention. Foreign Minister Arita of Japan issued a statement on the 15th, stating that Japan has a deep concern about the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Recently, Dutch newspapers have paid great attention to this. The "Volk" newspaper commented that the British and American navies would not occupy the Dutch East Indies even if the Netherlands were drawn into the war, and that Japan must understand that Germany has no ability to attack Dutch overseas colonies. Newspapers here have published in large characters special dispatches from Washington and Tokyo regarding the Dutch East Indies being drawn into the war, especially a report from a London correspondent stating that "the US government will inevitably take action due to the development of the situation in the Dutch East Indies," which has attracted general attention. (Allied News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers and the Foreign Ministry spokesman today both released hints that Japan may take action regarding the Dutch East Indies soon. Foreign Minister Arita stated yesterday after a special cabinet meeting that he was concerned about any situation that could change the status of the Dutch East Indies. This morning, the newspapers widely elaborated on this statement, and this morning the Foreign Ministry spokesman also stated that this statement was a prelude to Japan's action on this matter, and that in any case, we do not want to see the Dutch East Indies fall into the hands of foreigners. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the Foreign Minister's remarks were only the overture to Japan's actions, and that Japan's actions would depend on the development of the situation in the future. Foreign Minister Arita stated yesterday that Japan has close economic relations with the South Seas, especially the Dutch East Indies, and other East Asian countries also maintain close economic relations with it. In other words, Japan and other East Asian countries and the South Seas region all interact and mutually support each other to contribute to the prosperity of East Asia. If the European war extends to the Netherlands and has repercussions in the Dutch East Indies, it will not only hinder the maintenance and enhancement of the above-mentioned economic interdependence and co-existence and cooperation, but also create an unfortunate situation from the viewpoint of maintaining peace and stability in East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese government cannot but pay close attention to the creation of such a situation, which could cause the expansion of the European war to affect the status of the Dutch East Indies. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch, the English-language Japan Times wrote today that the Dutch East Indies belongs to a small European country, but if it is controlled by a non-Eastern country, Japan cannot but pay attention to it. If neutral European countries wish to change their Far Eastern policies, they must first obtain Japan's opinion. Otherwise, Japan may be forced to change its policy of non-intervention. In other words, if the great powers draw the Dutch East Indies into the war, Japan may also be drawn in. Japan's attitude towards the belligerent countries has not changed, but if the situation in the East Indies changes, Japan's attitude will also change. Japan and the Netherlands both have peaceful development ideas for the Pacific. (Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch, Arita invited Dutch Minister Pabst to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:50 PM on the 15th for about 45 minutes. Arita explained the Japanese government's views and asked him to convey them to his home government. (Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch, news reporters visited Arita on the 15th and asked what Japan's position would be if the Netherlands were drawn into the European war and what its impact would be on the Dutch East Indies. Arita replied that Japan and various parts of the South Seas have close economic ties with each other, especially the Dutch East Indies, and other East Asian countries also maintain close ties with it. In other words, Japan and other East Asian countries and various parts of the South Seas rely on each other and help each other, contributing to the prosperity of East Asia. If the war extends to the Netherlands and affects the Dutch East Indies, it will not only affect the maintenance and development of the above-mentioned economic interdependence, co-existence, and common prosperity, but also, in terms of "peace" and "stability" in East Asia, it will cause an unpleasant situation. The Japanese government, in view of this, cannot but express its deep concern about the situation caused by the expansion of the European war, which affects the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. (Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to news dispatches from Batavia received here, government officials in the Dutch East Indies are unwilling to comment on the possibility of the Netherlands being drawn into the vortex of the European war, but the Dutch East Indies government has ordered special police to be stationed around postal, telephone, railway, and radio facilities for protection. Signs of unease seem to be limited to government authorities. The general public shows little tension on the surface. Dutch expatriates there believe that (1) the Netherlands strictly adheres to neutrality, and both the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies do not want to be drawn into the European war; (2) from the Netherlands' neutral standpoint, it will not automatically propose the need for protection by a third country, so it is believed that Britain and the United States will not take any measures to protect the Dutch East Indies without the Netherlands' proposal. Finally, it is not difficult to imagine that the Dutch East Indies will strengthen the powers of its governor-general and still be ruled by the Netherlands. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers in Tianjin Insult an American Resident; US Consulate Protests</h3>
<p>Tianjin - Last January, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin stated that American people should be treated the same as people of other countries regarding the blockade of Tianjin. This statement has now become a reality, and US Consul General Gatweer has sent a note to the Japanese side requesting an explanation for the various incidents that have occurred recently and awaiting their reply. Gatweer's note was sent at the request of the American Chamber of Commerce after a meeting of the US Chamber of Commerce last week. During the meeting, American businessmen unanimously agreed that the recent measures taken by Japan have been very inconvenient for American businessmen and requested the Consul General to report the situation to the government and protest to the Japanese side. Japan's attitude towards the United States underwent a sudden change on April 6th. The regulations for Americans passing through Japanese military checkpoints have been modified. Previously, Americans only needed to show their pass on the car window to pass through Japanese military checkpoints. Since Saturday, Americans have been forced to get out of the car and wait for Japanese soldiers to inspect it. During the inspection, sometimes the contents of the American's luggage are dumped on the car floor. The first incident occurred last week when an American named Nicole, the owner of an American radio company, who works for an American company in Tianjin, had to pass through the Japanese military checkpoint ten times a day due to his duties. He refused to comply with the Japanese sentry's order to get out of the car. Later, several Japanese officers arrived, and at the same time, personnel from the US consulate also arrived. US consulate personnel asked why Americans were not allowed to pass. The Japanese officer said that the Japanese sentry wanted to inspect the car. Nicole said that the Japanese soldier did not say he wanted to conduct an inspection. The Japanese officer said that Nicole passes through frequently, causing the Japanese sentry to be suspicious. As a result, it was said that this was a misunderstanding, and the American was allowed to pass. Furthermore, according to Mr. Nicole, Japanese soldiers entered his office last year and searched his documents. Mr. Nicole also reported this matter to Gatweer. Therefore, Gatweer's note requested the Japanese side to pay attention to this incident. In addition, there was also an incident involving an eleven-year-old American girl. She had to get off her bicycle every time she passed through the Japanese military checkpoint. Last week, she was forced to get off the bicycle and told to stand at attention in front of the sentry. After standing at attention, she was allowed to show her pass. Then a Chinese policeman came forward and tried to force the American girl to kneel to the Japanese soldier. The American girl refused. The Japanese soldier then let her go. The American girl's father is also preparing to report this matter to the Consul General. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Complex Solar Halo Discovered in Yong'an</h3>
<p>Yong'an - On the morning of the 10th, the sky here was full of cirrostratus clouds. At 9:00, a solar halo was discovered all around, with a blue exterior and red interior, with bright colors. After half an hour, there was a white parhelion (sun dog) that encircled the sun. A quarter of an hour later, there were two white circular arcs intersecting in the white halo, resembling a jade linked ring in the high clear sky, truly a rare spectacle. After another ten minutes or so, a large 46-degree iridescent halo appeared in the southeastern sky. These several rings were displayed together in a magnificent and dazzling display of colors, gradually dissipating until noon. Citizens throughout the city looked up to the sky in amazement. According to the Meteorological Bureau, this kind of solar halo is a sign of changes in the weather, meaning "a lunar halo brings wind, a damp foundation brings rain" as the ancients said. It can only be discovered when there are cirrostratus clouds in the sky. The clouds are 7,000 to 10,000 meters above the ground, mostly composed of hexagonal ice crystals. Sunlight enters, causing refraction and reflection, thus forming a halo. On August 24th of the 22nd year, and on January 22nd and 23rd of the 23rd year, complex solar halos were discovered in Mount Emei, Sichuan, and Xi'an, Shaanxi, respectively. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Northern Henan Recaptures Xubao</h3>
<p>Luoyang, Henan - After the Chinese army recaptured Jiusi Township, they launched an offensive towards the Japanese in the Wanghe area (east of Qinyang) inside Xubao on the 11th. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 300 Japanese were killed, and more than 100 rifles and 11 machine guns were seized. The remaining Japanese retreated northward in a panic. Both places have been reported to be recaptured. (Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Urges All Countries to Work Together for Lasting Peace, Hoping to Establish Mutually Beneficial Economic Relations Internationally, But the World Must Still Be Prepared to Meet Provocation with Force - Anniversary of the Founding of the Pan American Union</h3>
<p>Washington - Today is the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Pan American Union. President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Union, urging all countries to follow the example of the American countries and work together for lasting peace. He said, "In the Western Hemisphere, no one has created the absurd theory of supermen or racism, and no one advocates establishing a dictatorship through world revolution. We only hope that all countries in the world can join us on the path to peace. To this day, we still face some old problems. Universal and lasting peace is still a dream. The shadow of war has once again enveloped some parts of the earth, and its horror and destructive power are unprecedented. Thoroughly speaking, a country that feels that it is under the shadow of threat or aggression cannot have true peace. However, as far as the American continent is concerned, we recognize that only by establishing mutually beneficial economic relations internationally can we obtain the necessary raw materials to improve the living standards of our people and enable us to enjoy peace. As early as 1926, the American countries held the First Peace Conference in Panama City, making many efforts for peace, and established the Pan American Union the following year. Our country has also taken various measures to prevent the American continent from being drawn into the vortex of war. I pray to God that all our actions will be limited to this. Once it is necessary, we will respond and will certainly achieve complete success, which I firmly believe. In short, peace achieved through the balance of power of countries in the military field is not only dangerous but also unsustainable. The ideal of peace advocated by the Panama Peace Conference must be realized among countries that are equal, free, and agree to use peaceful means to resolve all disputes. Therefore, I welcome all countries in the world to follow the example of the Americas and work together for peace. But this peace struggle cannot be opened up unless people are prepared to resolutely respond to provocation with force when necessary. This is something we must know. We have heard that certain races regard themselves as having the right to dominate the world. If so, any changes in the Old World will have a major impact directly on the peace and welfare of the New World. Therefore, the American countries must consult each other on whether our peace is threatened and work together to defend ourselves. At this point, the President concluded, "Charity is better than hatred, and belief in humanity and justice is better than belief in force. The result of using force will ultimately be that one suffers the consequences." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - When President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Pan American Union today, envoys from various countries were all present, but when President Roosevelt attacked the policy of force, diplomatic representatives from Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Spain all left their seats.

<h3>US Steel Export Statistics</h3>
<p>New York - Regarding the situation of US steel exports, the American Iron and Steel Institute recently published statistics. In 1939, a total of 1,799,000 tons were exported (excluding scrap iron), a decrease of more than one million tons compared to the 3,892,000 tons exported in 1937, but a slight increase compared to the 2,407,000 tons exported in 1938. As for the countries that purchased the most iron last year, Asian countries and the Commonwealth of Australia ranked first, accounting for 26 percent of the total US exports, and European countries accounted for 24 percent. In 1938, Asian countries and the Commonwealth of Australia accounted for 40 percent, and Europe accounted for 20 percent. As for what South Australian countries purchased last year, it accounted for 10 percent of total exports, only 15 percent in 1938. The Commonwealth of Canada accounted for 15 percent last year, 12 percent in 1938. Central American countries accounted for 11 percent last year, 8 percent in 1938, all showing slight increases. Africa accounted for 4 percent last year, roughly the same as in 1938. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau Says Britain Has Not Violated the Spirit of the Monetary Agreement; US Treasury Department Studies Various Methods to Protect Investments in Denmark and Norway</h3>

<h3>US Navy Department Asks Senate to Increase Funding for Shipbuilding to Increase Naval Strength by a Quarter and Maintain a 5:3 Advantage Over Japan</h3>
<p>Washington - US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark yesterday requested the Senate Naval Affairs Committee to increase naval strength by 25 percent. The Vinson Naval Expansion Act only stipulates an 11 percent increase in the Navy. Admiral Stark stated that the main reason the Navy Department is requesting additional shipbuilding funding is to ensure that the US Navy exceeds Japan's advantage. According to "the most reliable sources," Japan is building eight super-dreadnoughts. He solemnly declared that there is very little official information about the number of secret warships being built by Japan. "Japan seems to feel that concealing news of shipbuilding will be more advantageous than not concealing it, as it will stimulate shipbuilding in Britain and the United States." He solemnly stated that the Navy Department's belief is to immediately build 167,000 tons of new battleships based on the Vinson's $655,000,000 naval expansion bill, as maintaining the 5-5-3 ratio is "more necessary" today than when that ratio was stipulated in 1922. Admiral Stark continued, "After the Munich Agreement, we felt that we had to defend against both the Atlantic and the Pacific at the same time." The Navy Department does not want to maintain separate fleets in the Atlantic and Pacific, but wants to maintain a five-to-three advantage over Japan. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark recently delivered a speech at the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, reporting on the current shipbuilding situation between the US and Japan, stating that: (1) Regarding main ships, Japan currently has almost eight ships under construction, and the United States has eight ships being built; (2) Regarding patrol ships, Japan has eight ships, and the United States has six ships; (3) Regarding destroyer fleets, both Japan and the United States have 32 ships each; (4) Regarding aircraft carriers, Japan has four ships, and the United States has two ships; (5) Regarding submarines, Japan has 20 ships, and the United States has 19 ships. Although it is not known whether the above Japanese shipbuilding figures are accurate, it is believed that the true situation is likely to exceed these figures. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark stated at the Senate Naval Affairs Committee today that strengthening the strength of the US fleet is the best way to prevent the United States from being dragged into the whirlpool of war. War is spreading everywhere in the world. Only by making its navy superior can the United States maintain its authority to control peace and war. Judging from the recent Battle of Narvik, it can be proved that although the power of the air force is quite strong, warships are still the indispensable backbone of naval battles. Therefore, in my opinion, the most important and urgent task for the US Navy at present is to immediately add two 45,000-ton super-dreadnoughts. As for the expansion plan to add 167,000 tons of new cruisers, new submarines, and new aircraft carriers, the Senate is also asked to pass it as soon as possible. Stark also said that raising the US Navy's battleships by 11 percent is the minimum necessary limit in view of the current world situation, but in my opinion, it should be increased by 25 percent. Stark asked that he obtain information that Japan is building eight super-dreadnoughts. After they are built, the ratio of Japanese battleships to the existing US battleships will increase to 18 to 23. Senator Walsh, the representative of Massachusetts, then submitted a formal application from the Navy Department. The application stated that the US Navy wants to obtain a location in the southeastern corner of the Caribbean Sea to establish a base for the fleet and air force, and that the United States should have sufficient naval power to resist enemies outside its coast and preserve its unparalleled paradise. (International News Service, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Navy Department recently issued a statement explaining the benefits of the United States building naval and air force bases in the Caribbean Sea, stating that the naval and air force bases established by the government in the southwestern Caribbean Sea are of great strategic value. They can not only consolidate American security but also facilitate the activities of the US fleet in all directions, so as to promote all countries to respect the American Monroe Doctrine. In addition, some congressmen have indeed submitted proposals to Congress, advocating that Britain and France should sell their islands in the Caribbean Sea to the United States to offset part of the war debts owed by the respective countries to the United States.

<h3>Lack of Foresight in Japanese Cargo Ship Replacements</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Following the extension of the war to Norway and Denmark, Japanese shipping industry figures are paying close attention. It is generally acknowledged that Norway ranks fourth globally in shipping capacity, possessing 4.8 million tons of cargo and oil tankers. Denmark also owns 1.2 million tons of ships. Since the outbreak of the European war, ships from these countries have been extremely active in the Far East. Due to a shortage of cargo ships, Japan had previously leased numerous vessels from them to handle transport between Japan and the Asian mainland. Now that they are withdrawing from Far Eastern shipping lanes, Japan will inevitably suffer a significant impact. To remedy this, the Japanese shipping industry plans to divert 50,000 tons of ships from long-distance routes for use on coastal routes. The Shipping Management Committee made a decision on this matter at a meeting in Kobe yesterday. Furthermore, the committee will also adopt various appropriate measures regarding maritime transport issues to promote development. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>American Fundraising for the Chinese Red Cross</h3>
<p>New York: Colonel Roosevelt (son of the late President Roosevelt), chairman of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, recently issued a statement, saying that he had received a telegram from the director of the Medical Division of the Chinese Red Cross stating, "Malaria is currently prevalent throughout China, especially rampant in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. There is a shortage of medicines in the interior, making treatment particularly difficult. We would be extremely grateful if you could provide fifteen million quinine tablets (each 3 cm) and one million bottles of 2 cc quinine hydrochloride solution (for injection)." Therefore, our committee urgently needs $150,000 to purchase these medicines and transport them to China to help eradicate the spread of malaria. Fundraising for this cause has now begun in over seventy cities in the United States. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>American Military Experts Predict US Entry into the European War Next Year</h3>
<p>New York: Franklin, a Washington correspondent for the New York Post, recently made a startling statement, saying that American military experts generally believe that regardless of the outcome of this year's election, the United States will join the European war next year. These experts base this belief on the events of the past seven months, increasingly convinced that American involvement is inevitable. Furthermore, since Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway, American public opinion has been greatly dissatisfied, and therefore advocacy for intervention has begun to sweep the country.

<h3>Italy Blatantly Expresses the Pursuit of Mediterranean Hegemony; The Corsica and Tunisia Issues Are Raised Again; Naval Maneuvers Are Held, Waiting for the Right Moment</h3>
<p>Chi-Ma (Rome): News today says that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will make a declaration expressing Italy's attitude toward the European war. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: An article by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece, Mr. Landor, published yesterday in the "Italian Daily," reviewing the Mediterranean issue, has attracted considerable attention from political circles here. Da (Landor) declared that now is an opportune time to study the historical background of the Mediterranean issue. The Mediterranean has always been a land of conflict and an area of political struggle. Our review of French policy since the 13th century proves that the sole objective of French expansionism is to control the Mediterranean. France's policy of striving for Mediterranean hegemony has deep roots, and the interests vital to Italy's survival have also been suppressed. France has occupied Corsica, Tunisia, and Syria as bases. France occupied Corsica in 1768, but the King of Sardinia had already occupied Maddalena and Caprera eleven years earlier, considering them part of Corsica. Corsica has Italian customs and habits and controls the Italian coast on the Tyrrhenian Sea. France's occupation of the island aims to control Italy. France's occupation of Tunisia is not due to the natural need for territorial expansion but due to the desire to seize military and political dominance in the Mediterranean, thereby forming a permanent threat to Italy. Da (Landor) then reviewed France's anti-Italian policies after World War I, especially emphasizing the period of the Italo-Ethiopian War and mentioning the influence of France's anti-Italian attitude on Yugoslavia's foreign policy. The article concludes by declaring that the current Mediterranean issue is a confrontation between the natural rights of the Italian people and France's military and imperialist policies. France's rights in the Mediterranean are unquestionable, but France, with a smaller population than Italy, occupies both sides of the Mediterranean. Although France has the right to maintain maritime communication with its Far Eastern territories, France should not infringe upon the vital interests of other countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: It is widely rumored that the Italian Navy's First and Second Fleets began their spring exercises yesterday. Although officials here have stated that no news has been received regarding the movements of warships, in reality, the two fleets have been engaged in partial exercises since mid-March. The First Fleet sailed to Durazzo, and the Second Fleet sailed from the port of Spezia to cruise around Sardinia and Sicily. The scope of this exercise is evident. Diplomatic circles believe that this move by the Italian Navy should be seen as a plan to assist Germany, warning the Allies that they cannot transfer their Mediterranean warships to reinforce the North Sea.

<p>London: Political figures here recently stated that the Soviet Union still wants to maintain diplomatic relations with Britain and France. As for Italy, apart from showing a slightly moderate attitude on this issue due to the urgent need for coal, it clearly harbors malice toward Britain and France and has expressed it in all aspects, causing its neighbors such as Yugoslavia and Greece to feel uneasy and thus have to take defensive measures to prepare for any eventuality. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources stated that the British government recently hinted to Italy that the wanton attacks on Britain and France by Italian newspapers are making the European situation increasingly tense, ultimately leading to irreversible major difficulties. In short, Italy intends to divert general attention to the Mediterranean to facilitate Hitler's actions in Northern Europe, but no matter what Mussolini intends, Britain and France have taken various precautionary measures in diplomacy and military affairs and will not panic because of it.

<h3>Germany Strengthens Diplomatic Presence in Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin: The current director of the Foreign Ministry's political department, Bismarck, has recently been appointed as First Counselor to the German Embassy in Italy, and Second Counselor Berlson has also been awarded the title of Minister. According to the German official news agency, this appointment is to strengthen Germany's diplomatic representation in Italy. The active cooperation between the two Axis powers and the special significance of Italy in German diplomatic relations can be seen from this. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Speaks for Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin: The Rome correspondent of the "German General Report" declared today that Italy fully and unconditionally supports Germany's actions in Northern Europe. This is an instruction issued by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Italian newspapers. The correspondent said that Germany's recent actions on the Norwegian coast have dealt a great blow to Britain. Italy, because Britain has always hindered Italy's development, is optimistic about its success and unanimously approves of Germany's actions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: The newspapers here are all talking about Germany's victory in Northern Europe, intending to give the general readers the impression that Germany has won a great victory in the war against Britain and France, while glossing over the situation of Norwegian resistance.

<h3>British Troops Land and Gain Foothold; Fresh Troops Open Way to Norway to Reinforce; The Allies Fulfill Their Promise, and Their Rapid Arrival Is Enough to Give Germany a Major Spiritual Repercussion</h3>
<p>London: The "Daily Citizen" recently reported that since the British army landed at Narvik, Norway, a large number of soldiers and munitions are being transported to the Norwegian front for replenishment. Yesterday, several trains loaded with military supplies arrived at a certain port, and the authorities immediately requisitioned all ships in the port to undertake transportation. Many tanks, trucks, and armored vehicles were seen being loaded onto ships at the same time as the various trains. After these transport ships set sail, they were escorted by several warships that had participated in the naval battle in the Skagerrak Strait. The process went very smoothly. In addition, British fresh troops are expected to arrive in Norway tomorrow. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that the British expeditionary force arriving in Norway includes units from all over the British Isles, all of which are troops accustomed to various climates. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today, the official spokesperson here explained the reasons why the German side did not announce the strength or location of the British troops landing in Norway as follows: Although Germany has spies everywhere, we have good reason to believe that they know very little about the Allies' plans. This landing of British troops is an extremely important event, with repercussions in spirit, diplomacy, and military affairs. If the German people learn of the actual situation, they will be greatly affected spiritually. This move will further break down the German propaganda that democratic countries cannot make any decisions or implement their decisions. The spokesperson concluded by saying that this expeditionary force landed in Norway within six days, which is an excellent military achievement. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: The military correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" commented on the British landing in Norway today, saying that the British landing will not encounter resistance except from the air. We cannot expect immediate and surprising progress. The selection of the landing site may be mainly for the establishment of an air force base. However, due to terrain limitations, this base may only temporarily supply seaplanes. In some places, the British army has landed several small detachments to liaise with the Norwegian army and establish key points for the gathering of Norwegian troops or volunteers. Regardless of where the main force lands, it must establish a base and supply station under the protection of a covering force, and the establishment of anti-aircraft artillery defenses is also a top priority. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Sweden is quite excited about the news of the British landing in Norway. The Norwegian coastline has natural obstacles, and the British action was so rapid that the Swedish public was deeply impressed and asked how and where the British were able to establish their base on the coast. It is generally believed that Narvik is far to the north, and the main British force must have landed south of Narvik to provide Norway with much-needed assistance. "Le Petit Parisien" stated that the Lofoten Islands opposite Narvik are one of the landing sites of the British expeditionary force. There is great concern here about the situation in Norway, and it is expressed that the British can take timely action and effectively stop Germany from penetrating further. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to well-informed military sources, the widespread news from the British side that British troops have landed in Norway is still the usual exaggeration and propaganda. Currently, there are no traces of British troops in the military strategic points of Norway and the places occupied by the German army. If British troops have indeed landed in Norway, it must be in unimportant locations where no German troops are stationed. This landing has no military value and little hope of development. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The War Situation on the Southeastern Norwegian Front Is Critical; German Mechanized Forces Are Fiercely Attacking; The City of Kongsvinger Is Reportedly Fallen</h3>
<p>London: According to a Norwegian government wireless transmission relayed from Stockholm, Sweden, German troops landed by parachute near Dombaas, at the intersection of the Oslo-Trondheim railway and the Åndalsnes-Trondheim railway. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Although Norwegian troops are resolutely fighting to prevent German troops from advancing northwest of Oslo towards the Swedish border, according to recent news, German troops have achieved local victories in Norway. General attention is focused on the southeastern front, where German troops are reported to have cut off the retreat of several thousand Norwegian troops, and the situation in Kongsvinger is believed to be quite critical. The "Social Democratic Newspaper" estimates that there are at least 16,000 German troops in the area. Although Norwegian troops are fighting bravely, the fall of Kongsvinger is imminent. It is reported that German troops have reached a point about six miles from the city, and Norwegian troops are trying to block them, with hundreds already killed in action. It is also reported that the Norwegian front line key point of Skarnes, twelve miles west of Kongsvinger, has a large force of German troops. However, military figures here claim that without a steady stream of reinforcements, Germany's rapid victory is not enough to mention. In addition, the German army needs heavy artillery and other assistance, which cannot all be transported by air. Two German aircraft were forced to land in Sweden yesterday due to lack of fuel, proving that Germany is already feeling a fuel shortage. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: Rumor has it that Norwegian troops have withdrawn from the city of Kongsvinger under orders from the country's high command, and German troops are now entering the city. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Regarding the situation of the war in Norway, the news from various sources is summarized as follows: (1) A correspondent from the Swedish News Agency stationed in Charlottenberg, Norway, recently telegraphed that German mechanized troops have attacked the city of Kongsvinger (48 miles northeast of Oslo), and Norwegian troops have withdrawn from Skarnes and are continuing to engage the German army in the nearby forests. It is learned that German troops crossed the Glomma River last night and attacked Santel from the side. (2) According to an official Norwegian announcement, German pilots parachuted into Shemsbuk City in an attempt to destroy the railway from Luna City to Åndalsnes City and have all been disarmed and detained by the Norwegian army. (3) Several Norwegian soldiers, along with some residents, crossed the border in Valmilan City into Sweden within the past 24 hours and were immediately detained by the Swedish authorities. (4) A Swedish radio station issued a message saying that German troops are attacking Kongsvinger City, and their advance units have advanced to Santeg City (ten kilometers east of Kongsvinger). It is also learned that German troops moved near Sarpsborg and detonated landmines laid by the Norwegian army, destroying the bridge over the Glomma River. As for the Norwegian troops in the northern part of the country, they were forced to retreat due to the interruption of railway traffic, but they are now safe and continuing to resist.

<p>Berlin: The German official news agency stated that more than 2,000 Norwegian troops surrendered to the German army in Krestinsen. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a war report today stating that British troops made no attempt to land in German-occupied areas yesterday. The British Air Force carried out an air raid on Narvik yesterday, but achieved no results. The Trondheim and Bergen areas were calm yesterday with no fighting. British aircraft repeatedly raided Stavanger, and two aircraft were shot down. At Ebuimon, north of Kristiansand, 150 officers and 2,000 soldiers of the Norwegian Third Division surrendered to the German army. The German army in the Oslo area is still moving according to the original plan. Clearing operations are still underway in southern Norway, and a total of 36 cannons have been seized. The German Navy in the Trondheim, Bergen, and Stavanger areas has increased its defensive strength. The German Air Force continued to conduct reconnaissance in the North Sea, the Norwegian coasts, and the area north of Narvik yesterday. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Naval Battle in the Skagerrak Strait</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: According to news from Gothenburg, there was a "very large naval battle" off the coast of Norway yesterday. It is generally believed that this battle is currently taking place in the Skagerrak Strait. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: The London correspondent of "Le Petit Parisien" telegraphed that since the outbreak of naval battles in Northern Europe last week, no fewer than seventy or eighty German ships (excluding troop transports) have been sunk, while only sixteen British warships have been lost. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Germany Declares Its Intention to Use the Air Force to Retaliate Against Britain; British Aircraft Groups Fly Over the Norwegian Coast for Reconnaissance; The Stavanger Airfield Is Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: Official circles in Berlin are now hinting that German aircraft will bomb British cities, using the German public announcement that the British Air Force bombed Bergen as an excuse. A Berlin dispatch from one newspaper said, "The German side has already given a reply, so the news that some British cities have been bombed is expected." (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that the British Air Force again raided the port of Stavanger, sinking at least two German seaplanes. British aircraft also dropped many heavy bombs on the airfield in the port. Several squadrons of the British Air Force participated in the raid, and all returned to base safely afterwards. Yesterday, British aircraft conducted continuous reconnaissance over the Norwegian coast throughout the day. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Britain and France Are Closely Watching the Situation in Southeastern Europe; The Conference of British Envoys Has Ended, Preparing to Launch a Diplomatic Offensive</h3>
<p>Paris: International affairs observers here generally believe that the war in Northern Europe will have an impact on Southeastern Europe. In other words, the German authorities hope to achieve something in that area to compensate for the setbacks suffered in the Scandinavian Peninsula. The request to take on police duties along the Danube River may be a prelude to the country's preparation to advance into the Balkans. A large number of German "Volksdeutsche" have now arrived in Yugoslavia, causing the country's authorities to feel deeply uneasy. Germany has concentrated a large number of troops in the province of Austria, and Germans within Switzerland openly admit that Germany intends to achieve something immediately. In addition, Italy has sent 25,000 "sharecroppers" to Albania and, under the guise of naval exercises, has concentrated fleets in the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean, opposite Greece. All of these can be noted. As a result of the talks between the heads of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass, it was originally decided to maintain the status quo in the Balkans. Now that Hitler has failed to achieve his goals in the Scandinavian Peninsula, he has had to change course and attempt to move elsewhere. However, the countries of the Balkans, in light of Norway's courageous resistance, have been deeply impressed and will not easily surrender to Germany. At this moment, the conference of British envoys to various countries in Southeastern Europe has concluded in London and will soon return to their posts. The French envoys to those countries, including the ambassador to Turkey, Massigli, have also returned to their posts, which shows that Britain and France are closely watching the situation in this corner of Europe and are determined to deal with it. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: British envoys to the Balkan countries and senior officials of the Foreign Office have decided to launch a diplomatic offensive against the Balkan countries after holding a meeting. According to semi-official sources, Britain will strengthen the economic and political ties between the Balkan countries and the Western European democracies. Well-informed diplomatic circles also believe that the British envoys will submit documents to the Balkan countries requesting them to oppose the wishes of the German government, including various economic demands, and will compensate them with "the promise of assistance from Britain and France." Yugoslavia is the center of the British diplomatic offensive, and Britain and France will grant loans. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Norwegian Puppet Government Is a Flash in the Pan; Another Committee Is Formed to Take Over the Administration of the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>London: The Oslo radio station controlled by the German side recently announced that Quisling's puppet government has resigned, and an "Administrative Committee" has taken over the administration of the German-occupied areas in Norway. The head of the committee is Christian Christensen, the mayor of Oslo. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The legitimate Norwegian government recently issued a public announcement via radio, describing the circumstances of the German invasion of the country, stating that before German troops invaded our country, the German envoy Brauer saw our King Haakon VII and requested that Quisling (i.e., the Prime Minister of the Norwegian puppet government) be appointed as Prime Minister to form a new cabinet, which the King immediately refused. He was willing to form a new cabinet that would cooperate with Germany, but Envoy Brauer said that the King could appoint any cabinet members other than the Prime Minister at will, but Chancellor Hitler insisted that Quisling must be the Prime Minister and that there could be no concessions. The King insisted and said that anyone who could not gain the trust of the entire people could not be appointed as Prime Minister. Envoy Brauer then asked the King whether Norway would resist if Germany made a demand by force, to which the King resolutely replied, "Yes, we will do our best."

<h3>The Norwegian Government Orders Soldiers and Civilians to Cooperate with British and French Allied Forces to Achieve the Goal of Recovering Lost Territory; British and French Currency Can Also Be Used in Norway</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The Norwegian government's radio broadcast mentioned the military assistance of the Allied forces, saying that we are now continuing to fight, and we are certain that cooperation with the Allied forces will enable the Norwegian people to recover Norway. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: After British troops landed in Norway, the Norwegian government issued a notice ordering Norwegian authorities to establish close contact with British and French Allied forces, stating that in the face of national crisis, the Norwegian people must establish their victorious national life and the right to national independence. It also ordered the Norwegian people to accept British and French legal tender, as Norwegian currency may not be sufficient for use. The exchange rate will be determined and announced shortly by the Norwegian issuing bank and the Bank of England. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Reports on the Nordic War Situation</h3>
<p>Paris – Today, French Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a speech in the Senate, discussing the military operations in Scandinavia. He stated that after eight days of battle, the first result is the irreparable destruction of the German fleet. Its losses are estimated at 30% of the total tonnage destroyed, 20% of cruisers sunk, 25% of destroyers sunk, 15% damaged, and numerous submarines sunk. The second result is that within the same period, 78,000 tons of German merchant ships were sunk or captured, while Allied merchant ships suffered no losses. The third result is that the route for transporting iron ore to Germany has been cut off. The fourth result is the significant setback suffered by Germany, whose failures include not only its navy but also its propaganda. Reynaud also praised the King of Norway, stating that he has refused to become a second Hacha (President of Czechoslovakia). Reynaud continued, saying that Allied forces have landed and joined with the Norwegian army, and that more Allied troops are en route. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Sweden's Southwest Regions on Alert</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – Several areas in southwestern Sweden were declared to be in a "state of readiness" starting today, in anticipation of air raids. Swedish officials stated that Sweden is now prepared to deal with any eventuality. Swedish police have arrested numerous undesirable individuals. All ships entering Swedish ports are subject to strict searches. The government has issued an order to requisition all mineral ores within Sweden. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Troop Movements Busy on the Western Front, Netherlands and Belgium Increase Vigilance, Netherlands Strictly Inspects Ships Entering Ports, Belgium Studies Protecting National Security</h3>
<p>Luxembourg – According to a report from Iktanaak, there were significant troop movements last night within German territory near the Luxembourg border. It is said that these movements are merely for troop rotation, but the scale is undoubtedly larger than usual. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague – The government authorities have recently issued a public statement stating that the Port of Delfzijl at the mouth of the Ems River in our country (opposite the Port of Emden in Germany) will strictly implement inspection measures. Subsequently, any ship of 140 tons or more, if it wishes to enter the port, must request our government to hire a pilot on its behalf and accept inspection by our warships; otherwise, it may encounter great danger. Regarding this matter, observers here recently commented that the Dutch government has taken this measure to prevent "German merchant ships and sailors" from congregating in the Port of Delfzijl. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris – According to a telegram from Brussels, the Belgian cabinet is studying methods to protect national security, especially regarding the issue of foreigners residing in Belgium. It has been decided to establish a concentration camp in Roulers, West Flanders, to detain suspicious foreigners. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The second batch of conscripts for the 1940 class was originally scheduled to be drafted into the army on July 1st. Military authorities, due to the serious situation, have now ordered them to enlist today. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Blockade Line to Extend to the Far East, Soviet Union Negotiates with Britain Again Over Detention of Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>London – Economic Warfare Minister Cross stated in the House of Commons today that he has received a large amount of information regarding the transport of goods from Los Angeles and various South American ports to Vladivostok. There is now sufficient evidence to prove that the final destination of these goods is Germany, and practical steps are being taken to detain these goods. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London – Well-informed sources considered yesterday that Britain will implement a stricter blockade regarding the shipment of strategic materials via Vladivostok to Germany, and believe that it is inevitable that naval warfare in Europe may extend to the Pacific. According to information obtained by the Central Government, the Soviet Union has granted Germany the right to transport 1,000 tons of goods to Germany daily via the Siberian Railway, and the increased import of strategic materials from the United States to Vladivostok will inevitably cause the Central Government to intensify its blockade of Vladivostok. British warships will also strictly monitor the transport of rubber and tin from the Dutch East Indies to Vladivostok. The British authorities firmly believe that Vladivostok is a major loophole in the blockade of Germany, so it has decided to order the British Navy to be responsible for closing the loophole. According to figures received here, the total amount of copper ore imported into the Soviet Union in 1938 was 60,000 to 80,000 tons, of which 50,000 tons were transported from the United States, but from September 1939 to March 1940, the Soviet Union imported 70,000 tons of copper ore from the United States alone. The import of rubber into the Soviet Union in 1938 was 45,000 tons, none of which was transported from the United States, but within seven months of the outbreak of the European war, the Soviet Union imported 25,000 to 30,000 tons of rubber, of which 6,000 tons were transported from the United States. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>London – The two Soviet ships "Selinga" and "Makoveiki," which were captured by British warships in the Pacific Ocean in December of this year for carrying wartime contraband and handed over to the French prize court for disposal, have prompted the Soviet government to repeatedly negotiate with Britain. Recently, well-informed sources have stated that the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, visited Foreign Office official Butler last week to inquire about the current situation of these ships. It is reported that in addition to reiterating the protest and reserving the right to demand compensation for damages, the ambassador also stated that this decision by Britain and France is sufficient to hinder the progress of commercial negotiations between the two countries and the Soviet Union, revealing his intention to test whether the British government is prepared to reopen commercial negotiations with the Soviet Union. However, Foreign Office official Butler reportedly adopted an extremely reserved attitude towards this proposal, merely stating that Britain and France will never allow other countries' goods to be transported to Germany. Political figures here say that Britain is unwilling to allow relations with the Soviet Union to deteriorate, but the Soviet Union must provide concrete guarantees on the following points: (1) The country will no longer seek to obtain various benefits in military strategy; (2) The country will no longer become a warehouse for Germany and will automatically reduce the quantity of goods transported to Germany. As of now, apart from fulfilling the Finnish-Soviet peace treaty according to the scheduled time, there are no other signs to prove that the country has "peaceful intentions," which is indeed the real situation. However, this one fact of faithfully fulfilling the peace treaty, coupled with the country's willingness to maintain diplomatic relations with Britain, shows that the country does not want to maintain too close a relationship with Germany at this time. Moreover, according to reliable sources, the Soviet government has requested the US authorities to introduce technicians to work in the country, which is another proof that the country is unwilling to get too close to Germany, because the country has the possibility of hiring German technicians. In short, the future relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will depend on what kind of guarantees the country can provide regarding its policies. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Army Encourages Army Generals, Demands Improvement of Military Discipline</h3>
<p>Tokyo – At the annual meeting of Japanese Army division commanders, Army Minister Toshiriku stated in his speech that Japan must break away from its dependence on foreign countries and establish an impregnable defense to reassure the people and support the national structure to meet the needs of a long-term war. Although I have confidence in the bright future of the Japanese Empire, the current domestic and international situations necessitate drastic improvements. Japan is currently pursuing a path of expansion, and I have no doubts about its bright future. Unfortunately, the current situation surrounding our country causes me to suspect that everything may be out of order. The army bears a major responsibility to the people. The people are now making huge sacrifices and must continue to make even greater sacrifices. The army is carrying out the handling of the China Incident and strengthening its armaments. In addition to minimizing all kinds of expenses as much as possible, you should also improve military discipline and boost morale, so as to set an example for the people and maintain its prestige overseas. The main points of the Army Minister's speech are as follows: Since the "launch of the holy war" in our country, two and a half years have passed. During this period, the situation encountered by our country has become increasingly serious. The "new regime" in China has been announced, which is a sign that the handling of the China Incident has entered a new stage. The strengthening of armaments has also begun, and the foundation of national defense is now being laid to meet the needs of the new state of affairs in East Asia. However, there are things in the trend of domestic and international events that make it impossible to have an optimistic view of the overall situation. The basic policy for dealing with these situations lies in strengthening domestic institutions so that we can cope with a long-term war, promote the national spirit, immediately break away from the state of dependence on foreign countries, and make national defense perfect, so that the people feel absolutely safe, and that China and third countries understand the unchanging policy of the Japanese Empire. Considering the actual situation of the army, the most important thing is to improve military discipline and strengthen the unity of the army, so as to establish a high morale. Officers are the core of the national army and must appreciate the dignity of the supreme command authority, maintain its prestige, set an example for their subordinates, be strict in rewards and punishments, and strive for thorough spiritual leadership. When you implement the plan to strengthen armaments, you must pay the most earnest attention to strengthening domestic institutions, so that the national army can fully fulfill its tasks in the event of a national emergency. The new stage of the China Incident has reached the point where the military department should plan for constructive savings to replace the destructive abuse of the early stages of the Incident. In short, the overall situation now requires the military department to predetermine methods and gradually implement them. I hope that you will be careful in using materials and paying funds, and do not forget that one object and one penny are obtained with the blood and sweat of the people. The entry of the China Incident into a prolonged stage has increased the complexity of artillery and various military protection equipment, so there is now a need to strengthen and adjust the military protection plan, and we must find ways to make the existing military protection equipment permanent, and we must spare no effort to take comprehensive care of the material and spiritual needs of soldiers. The Empire is now embarking on a path of development, and I have no doubts about the bright future. Unfortunately, the current situation surrounding the country causes me to fear that things may not be able to follow order. I hope that you will be far-sighted, use self-help with restraint, and assist in making the national army perfect and invincible, so as to live up to the work entrusted by the people. I also hope that you will promote military prestige at home and abroad and carry out the handling of the China Incident, thereby assisting in the great work of building a new order in East Asia.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs Decides to Establish a Southern Bureau as the Central Hub for Southern Development</h3>

<h3>Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, Chinese Watch Closely, Increased Tax Issue, Hope for Consideration of Commercial Difficulties, Careful Consideration, Whether to Keep or Abolish the Band Will Have a Fierce Debate, British and American Ratepayers Will Attend Enthusiastically Today</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of Western ratepayers will be held at 2:30 pm today at the Racecourse General Club. The meeting has prepared a large meeting place and expects 6,000 to 8,000 ratepayers to attend. According to the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang, the most important items on the agenda are: (1) Approval of the taxes to be collected; (2) Approval of the Public Works Department's budget; (3) Approval of the Public Works Department's final accounts; (4) Election of land committee members. At the meeting, the Western Ratepayers' Association has prepared several loudspeakers and sent people to take charge of them. Ratepayers who wish to speak must broadcast through the loudspeakers so that all ratepayers in the meeting place can hear.</p>
<p>The Annual Meeting Agenda Has Eight Items</p>
<p>The agenda for this year's Western Ratepayers' Association meeting has a total of eight items: (1) Election of the chairman of the meeting; (2) Election of the secretary of the meeting; (3) Approval of the rules adopted by this year's annual meeting; (4) Election of the land committee; (5) Election of the hospital administrators; (6) Approval of the Public Works Department's final accounts for 1939; (7) Approval of the draft budget for 1940; (8) Decision on the rules to be adopted for the next annual meeting. The famous judge Mr. Moss will be recommended as the chairman of the meeting, and Mr. Nash will be recommended as the secretary of the meeting. Regarding the first three items on the agenda, the rules of procedure set by the previous annual meeting will be adopted, but the eighth item regarding the voting method will be revised, not using the raising of hands method but implementing voting, maintaining its validity until the next annual meeting.</p>
<p>The Proposed Tax Increase is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>The most important proposal at this year's meeting is the 50% increase in municipal taxes, which is item seven of the eight items proposed by Frankling, Chairman, and Kewwick, Deputy Chairman, of the Public Works Department. The proposal briefly states that the Public Works Department's budget for 1940 to 1941 requires unanimous support from taxpayers. Although various parties oppose it, according to observers familiar with the actual situation, it is believed that the Public Works Department's proposed increase in municipal taxes will be difficult to change. If it is slightly modified, it will put the Public Works Department's administration into a state of chaos. This is because the Public Works Department's budget is the minimum amount of funding to maintain municipal, police, and other public services. If it is modified, not only will these public services not be able to maintain the status quo, but the banking sector will also cut off credit loans to the Public Works Department. According to authoritative sources, maintaining the current state of the Public Works Department's administration is necessary for the welfare of the citizens.</p>
<p>The Japanese Offensive is Difficult to Succeed</p>
<p>Japanese ratepayers convened another emergency meeting last night to discuss countermeasures for holding the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting. Their goal was nothing more than to take advantage of the proposed tax increase to attack the Public Works Department. However, the Public Works Department had already announced that proposals at the annual meeting must be submitted in writing six days before the meeting. At that time, the Japanese were busy campaigning and did not take this into account. According to Mr. Philip, Director-General of the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department has not received any written proposals from the Japanese side so far. Therefore, if the Japanese want to lodge a protest, they must take emergency action, but according to annual rules, such actions rarely succeed. Therefore, the Public Works Department predicts that all proposals can be passed smoothly at this year's annual meeting.</p>
<p>All Ratepayers Will Attend</p>
<p>The British and American sides and the Japanese side will launch another fierce struggle at the annual meeting today. As a result of days of preparation and activities, British and American community groups are deeply convinced of victory at this year's annual meeting. However, British and American electoral committee members are still working hard to win over all ratepayers, striving to guarantee attendance and participation to strengthen their momentum and defeat the Japanese again. The Public Works Department expects that the result of this year's Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting will maintain the status quo of the International Settlement. The reason for this is the same as the one that enabled them to win in the Public Works Department's election: the British and American sides already have a determined will to win. In past annual meetings, the method of raising hands was used for voting, and each taxpayer could only raise their hand for one vote. However, if a taxpayer expresses dissatisfaction with the method of raising hands, the meeting still allows it to adopt the voting method. When voting, each taxpayer can exercise their right to vote by proxy. Therefore, this year's meeting decided to adopt the voting method.</p>
<p>The Band Issue is the Target of Public Criticism</p>
<p>The English-language "American Evening News" stated that when Western ratepayers hold their annual meeting at the Racecourse Grandstand on the 17th, Mr. Zsolt will propose an amendment to the Public Works Department's budget, arguing that the Public Works Department should make the existing symphony orchestra an independent commercial organization, supported by a considerable annual subsidy from the Public Works Department. According to Mr. Zsolt, citizens who love music in Shanghai should organize a commercial orchestra themselves, following the example of major cities around the world, with an annual subsidy of 20,000 yuan from the Public Works Department, like the French Concession Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Department's budget for this year stipulates 200,000 yuan for the orchestra's expenses, and the general public has no reason to bear this burden. However, the conductor of the orchestra, Mr. Meipecki, said that this is an impossible and ridiculous plan, proposed by those who know nothing about the orchestra. There is no self-supporting orchestra in major cities around the world; they all rely on the support of wealthy music lovers. However, it is difficult to find permanent sponsors in Shanghai. The Public Works Department's orchestra currently has 50 musicians. If it is disbanded, 15% of them can still make a living by playing music in nightclubs, but the rest are accustomed to the instruments of a symphony orchestra, which are not the instruments used in nightclubs or bars. He is convinced that the Bureau will not abolish the orchestra.</p>
<p>Rumors of Layoffs in the Intelligence Office</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Department began implementing layoffs, there have been many rumors outside that various departments in the Public Works Department will continue to lay off employees, causing most employees to feel uneasy. Yesterday, rumors spread that Mr. Sahl of the Intelligence Office will also be laid off. Upon hearing this news, many foreign business people expressed their opposition. They said that Mr. Sahl is responsible for publishing information so that taxpayers can understand the inside story of the Public Works Department, and he is also the only medium of contact between the press and the Public Works Department. His sudden departure at this tense time when the Western Ratepayers' Association is convened is an "abnormal" move. They all requested the Public Works Department to continue to expand its intelligence work so that foreign nationals of all countries in Shanghai can understand the internal situation of the Public Works Department, arouse interest in the public utilities of the settlement, and work together to seek the happiness of the citizens. A foreign businessman said that he even wanted to raise a temporary motion at this year's meeting to express his opposition.</p>
<p>Chinese Oppose Increased Burden</p>
<p>The issue of tax increases has aroused great attention from the Chinese side. Since the majority of the citizens in the settlement are Chinese, the majority of the increased taxes will also be borne by the Chinese. A certain taxpayer with authority told the reporter, "We can understand the Public Works Department's tax increase because it is unable to make ends meet. However, we should start from the big picture. If there is another way to make up for the financial shortfall, we should never increase the burden on the citizens. It must be known that the people are the foundation of the settlement. Excessive exploitation is tantamount to driving fish into the abyss, and many malpractices will arise. The Public Works Department seems to pay little attention to the opinions of various parties. In the so-called cost-cutting measures in January, in addition to dismissing some foreign staff, it only thought of reducing prison rations. The former was praised and considered that the Public Works Department could accept good advice, but the latter was considered insignificant. (1) Reducing prison rations is a very small amount and has a minimal impact on expenditure. (2) Although prisoners are criminals, reducing food, whether from a humanitarian or health perspective, can be considered. We oppose the tax increase for two reasons: The people's livelihood is already extremely difficult. Since the Public Works Department cannot break through the Japanese blockade of goods, making the source of goods smoother and prices cheaper, and cannot strictly deal with unscrupulous merchants to stabilize prices, how can it simply increase the burden on the citizens and demand from the citizens at the stall of dried fish? This is one reason. The Public Works Department has many ways to reduce expenditure, such as canceling the London and New York offices and dismissing the orchestra, which have nothing to do with the overall well-being of the citizens, but why does the Public Works Department not do this and insist on increasing unnecessary burdens? This is the second reason. Many Japanese evade taxes, and the amount is not small. Why doesn't the Public Works Department find a way to remedy this to increase its income? This is the third reason. These points should not only be given serious consideration by the Public Works Department, but also should not be ignored at the Western Annual Meeting, which concerns the vital interests of taxpayers."</p>
<h3>Norwegian Merchant Ships Ordered to Stop Sailing West of Hong Kong, Those En Route Must Turn Back to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Traffic Between Shanghai and Hong Kong Will Continue as Usual for the Time Being</h3>
<p>After Norway was invaded by German troops, all ships sailing within Norwegian territorial waters have been placed under surveillance by Britain and France. Norwegian merchant ships sailing from the Far East to European countries have also been ordered to stop their activities. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Unable to Operate</p>
<p>Norwegian merchant ships account for the largest share of the world's ships, and the most sail to ports in European countries. Most of the Norwegian merchant ships in the Far East are concentrated in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The statistics show that there are more than 200 ships. Recently, since the expansion of the European war and the invasion of Norway by German troops, the British and French governments have taken a surveillance attitude towards ships sailing within Norwegian territorial waters. Not a few Norwegian merchant ships have been detained by the belligerent countries for wartime transport, causing the country's ships to be unable to operate.</p>
<p>Ordered to Stop Sailing</p>
<p>According to news from Norwegian shipping companies in this port, after the accident in Norway, Norwegian merchant ships sailing to Europe were first ordered to stop flying flags and to paint over their names to prevent attacks by belligerent countries. After the German troops invaded the Norwegian capital, the Norwegian government notified its consulates in various countries that all Norwegian ships sailing to Europe should stop sailing. The Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai also received a notice and instructed all ships to comply. Therefore, Norwegian ships sailing on the line west of Hong Kong in the Far East have all stopped sailing one after another, and those en route have been ordered to turn back.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong as Usual</p>
<p>As for Norwegian ships sailing on the Shanghai-Hong Kong line, the consulate is still temporarily allowed to sail. Therefore, the ships of Norwegian shipping companies managed in this port, such as Wheelock Marden, etc., continue to sail as usual, except for those sailing to Europe. However, some Norwegian ships no longer fly the Norwegian flag and nationality mark, and it is heard that the shipping companies are planning to return or change the nationality of all the Norwegian merchant ships they are managing to facilitate sailing. The Prominent, managed by the Central European Company at 12 Avenue Edward VII, is scheduled to leave Shanghai directly for Hong Kong on the 19th. The shipowner is responsible for Hakka cargo until the destination.</p>
<p>Norwegian Ship Movements</p>
<p>It is learned that a Norwegian ship was berthed on the riverbank yesterday. Reliable sources said that the Danish-Norwegian ships that left Manila last Sunday and were going to an unknown destination, their destination was Shanghai. The Norwegian ship "Telerismen" and the Danish ship "Panama" are the two ships that left Manila last Sunday. However, it is speculated that the two ships will not sail to Hong Kong. According to news from Manila, the "Panama" had crossed the US territorial waters in the Central Pacific Ocean, and the "Telerismen" was carrying a large amount of US mail. However, it is not known whether the mail is still on board or has been unloaded in the Philippines. As for the voyage of the Danish-Norwegian ships, it is now impossible to ascertain.</p>

<h3>Japanese Merchant Ship "Huamin" Sinks After Striking a Reef, Passengers Suffer a Terrible Calamity. More Than One Hundred Passengers Drown in a Storm En Route from Dinghai to Shanghai.</h3>
<p>The "Huamin," a vessel managed by the Japanese-owned Huadong Shipping Bureau on Renji Road in this city, set sail from Dinghai in eastern Zhejiang on the 13th of this month, carrying passengers and cargo, heading for Shanghai. Unfortunately, it struck a reef and sank, resulting in over a hundred casualties, marking another major tragedy after the sinking of the Jingsheng. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency obtained the following details:</p>
<p>Sailing from Dinghai to Shanghai</p>
<p>The vessel, originally named "Yongan," had a deadweight of 600 tons and had been in service for quite some time, resulting in a severely dilapidated hull. The company authorities had recently repaired it last month and renamed it "Huamin." On the 9th of this month, it first departed from Shanghai to Dinghai Shenjiadou. On the afternoon of the 13th, the vessel again departed from Dinghai Shenjiawan, carrying over 300 passengers and 9,000 pieces of cargo (including 3,000 vegetable cakes, 3,200 baskets of charcoal, bamboo, salted crabs, wine, etc.). The cargo weighed approximately 300 tons. Around 8 PM on the same day (the 13th), when sailing near the waters of Jintan, it encountered a sudden storm. The driver, concerned that the vessel, heavily loaded, would not withstand the storm, quickly steered the vessel to Taiping Mountain in Jintan, hoping to anchor and seek temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, due to excessive speed and poor visibility in the storm, the vessel unfortunately crashed violently into the reefs of Taiping Mountain, causing a large hole to be torn in the hull. Rushing seawater continuously flooded into the ship.</p>
<p>Those who drowned in the sea and inside the ship numbered nearly one hundred. Approximately two hundred people survived. Some passengers were reportedly rescued and have safely arrived in Shanghai. Some of the ship's crew have also arrived in Shanghai. By 9:30 PM, two-thirds of the ship had sunk into the sea. It is reported that the captain of the ship, Zhang, is missing. Relatives and family members of the passengers in Shanghai who received the news visited the bureau yesterday to inquire about information. According to the bureau, the telegram sent by the "Huamin" was extremely brief, only confirming that the vessel had struck a reef. There was no precise information on how many passengers had died. It was also stated that most of the passengers had been rescued by the "Antong" and transferred to Shanghai, expected to arrive today.</p>
<p>Struck Reef and Sank</p>
<p>At this time, all passengers on board panicked and used ropes to lower themselves to the shore, causing extreme chaos. Amidst the cries of passengers begging for help, some women and children fell into the sea, their cries shaking the heavens, a truly tragic scene. According to investigations, the number of those who drowned in the sea and were buried inside the ship was close to one hundred. Approximately two hundred people were fortunate to survive. Some passengers were reportedly rescued and have safely arrived in Shanghai. Some of the ship's crew have also arrived in Shanghai. By 9:30 PM, two-thirds of the ship had sunk into the sea. It is reported that the captain of the ship, Zhang, is missing. Relatives and family members of the passengers in Shanghai who received the news visited the bureau yesterday to inquire about information. According to the bureau, the telegram sent by the "Huamin" was extremely brief, only confirming that the vessel had struck a reef. There was no precise information on how many passengers had died. It was also stated that most of the passengers had been rescued by the "Antong" and transferred to Shanghai, expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>U.S. Admiral Hepburn Inspects South China, Will Visit Hong Kong and Amoy, Naval Exercises to Be Held</h3>
<p>U.S. Rear Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Far East Asiatic Fleet, has been stationed in the Philippines for nearly four months. It is learned that Admiral Hepburn may take the opportunity of his inspection to travel to Hong Kong and Xiamen on the private yacht "Isabel." The mission he bears is unknown. Because of Admiral Hepburn's inspection of South China, there is a possibility that the U.S. Navy's spring naval exercises will be held. Admiral Hepburn will come north after the U.S. ship "Asheville," which is stationed in Amoy, sails to Hong Kong, and will stay in Shanghai, reportedly to meet with the highest-ranking U.S. official stationed in the Philippines, Sayre, before sailing to North China. However, this could not be confirmed by the authorities last night, as there has been no official notification as to when Admiral Hepburn will come north.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Police Not Receiving Allowances, Individual Regulations Make Reasoning Impossible</h3>
<p>In view of the soaring food prices and difficult living conditions in various regions, the Ministry of Finance, in order to care for the livelihood of customs officers in various customs districts, has issued "wartime allowances," which are to be paid uniformly at 40% to all customs officers and tax police. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Jianghai Customs received the order from the Ministry of Finance, the Chinese and foreign commissioners of customs immediately convened to discuss payment methods. The result was: (1) All customs officers, because they are graduates of formal customs schools, will be paid according to regulations. (2) Tax police, because they are recruited through examinations and are not from customs schools, will not receive the allowance for the time being. This has been implemented accordingly. The 40% allowance for customs officers has already been paid separately, but the 259 tax police have not been paid. The entire tax police force believes that the "wartime allowance" issued by the Ministry of Finance is not limited to customs officers, but is only an individual regulation of the Shanghai Customs, and they are quite indignant. However, in this environment, it is impossible to reason with the customs authorities. The monthly salary of Shanghai Customs police ranges from a maximum of 70 yuan to a minimum of over 50 yuan. Last November, the Ministry of Finance approved a monthly increase of 14 yuan for rice allowances, and this March, the rice allowance was further increased by 7 yuan. According to a tax police officer yesterday, this measure by the authorities was indeed considerate of their subordinates, but the individual regulations of the Shanghai Customs were truly unexpected.</p>
<h3>United Charity Organization Still Willing to Serve the Poor by Distributing Bread, Funding Difficult to Sustain; Will Continue Operations if Others Join and Maintain Support</h3>
<p>Since last winter, the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation has noted that prices of all goods are soaring, and the poor are suffering from hunger and cold, and are dying of cold, a situation reported repeatedly. The persons in charge of the association, unable to bear the grief, found land to set up two shelters. However, they knew that the number of those sheltered was limited, and that there were many more who needed relief and survival, and that the greatest cause of death from cold was the lack of food. Without food, body temperature decreases and cannot resist the invasion of external cold. Therefore, they decided to distribute bread and ginger soup to increase the body temperature of the poor and supplement the shortcomings of the shelters. Thus, they started operating in a spirited manner on December 1st of last winter.</p>
<p>Distribution Locations</p>
<p>were initially on Dagu Road, during the evening. Later, as the number of people arriving increased daily and the location became insufficient, it was moved to Dahua Road for distribution. The number of people coming to beg for bread increased from several thousand to over ten thousand. Furthermore, due to concerns about overcrowding, a location was added on Mabai Road to facilitate distribution. It is estimated that the number of people receiving bread at both locations is consistently above 20,000. Here is a statistical list of the number of people receiving bread each month. In total, there have been over 1,886,200 recipients. Now that the weather is gradually warming up, the distribution time has been changed to 3-4 PM every day. At that time, gaunt and emaciated faces, the elderly, women, and children, come from over ten miles away, carrying two squares of bread, joyfully running home. Reporters also often visit to observe, and they know that this method is more convenient and straightforward than distributing congee. For congee distribution, recipients must bring their own containers, and distributors must build a shed and stove on-site. With bread distribution, the bread can be baked in a factory and sent to the distribution site by car. The distribution process is also faster than congee distribution. However, congee is a hot food, while bread is a cold food, so ginger soup is added on cold nights to make up for the deficiency. It is also more widespread than running a "fair rice" program, as only those with money can buy the rice, and it requires firewood to cook. At a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, cooking is by no means easy. Therefore, the poor receive substantial benefits from the distribution of bread. Consequently,</p>
<p>Donations from All Sectors</p>
<p>have been enthusiastic, with everyone believing that this type of relief is truly beneficial to all and donating generously. As of the day before yesterday, 53,560 yuan had been received in donations. In addition, the Red Swastika Society donated 1,105 bags of flour. However, on the expenditure side, 5,806 bags of flour were purchased, totaling 60,743.8 yuan in national currency. The cost of manufacturing and cooking was approximately 5,800 yuan, plus approximately 2,300 yuan for ginger, brown sugar, and various miscellaneous expenses. It was originally planned to end at the beginning of this month, but seeing that the "fair rice" program had stopped, it was feared that the poor would be cut off from assistance all at once, so it was extended to the 20th of this month. Recently, approximately 57,600 loaves of bread have been distributed daily, requiring 120 bags of flour. To continue until the 20th, there is still a shortage of over 10,000 yuan in funding. The association believes that food prices are now even higher than before. If enthusiastic members of society support and maintain the program and donations do not cease, they will continue to operate it to benefit the poor. The association is absolutely willing to serve the poor.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle on Qinghu Road, Japanese Aircraft Deployed, Japanese Troops Still Stationed in Zhaoxiang, Heavy Casualties on Both Sides</h3>
<p>The Qinghu Highway saw an unprecedented fierce battle yesterday morning as Japanese troops attempted to encircle the guerrilla forces of Gu Fusheng. According to travelers from Qibao Town in western Shanghai who arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, villages in the southwest area of Zhaoxiang were burned down during the battle yesterday. The battle ceased only in the evening. Casualties on both sides cannot be ascertained as the battle area is still under martial law. Currently, a large number of Japanese troops are still stationed in Zhaoxiang. However, Gu's troops, outnumbered, seem to have withdrawn to other locations at night to avoid a major battle. When the Japanese troops attacked yesterday, in addition to several tanks, there was also one aircraft circling and reconnaissance, but it did not drop any bombs. It is reported that the number of civilian casualties in the area is very high. The increased number of Japanese troops in nearby strongholds, such as Huangdu, Nanxiang, Panlong, Xujing, Guanyintang, Chonggu, and other towns, have not been withdrawn, so the situation is still tense. According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," around 2:00 AM on the 16th, Japanese aircraft flew to the Hongqiao area to assist the Japanese troops who were engaged in a battle with Chinese guerrillas along the Yuhang Highway. The battle between the two sides was quite fierce. According to warnings from both sides, heavy damage was sustained. Residents in the Hongqiao area did not initially pay attention to the dense gunfire, as they regarded it as the repeated exercises held by the Japanese side. The actual situation is that the battle is very tense.</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens in Nanshi Closed, Reopened the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The gambling dens in Nanshi were previously ordered to be closed by the Japanese side. It is now heard that the owners of these gambling dens have been actively working and lobbying in recent days. It seems that several gambling dens have obtained permission and reopened the day before yesterday (the 15th).</p>
<h3>Scramble for Unloading Work, Longshoremen Riot at the Observatory Wharf, Strict Patrols, Police Fire Shots to Disperse the Crowd</h3>
<p>The "Changde" of the Italian merchant Rocco Chi, managed by Jufeng Customs Brokerage, sails to various ports along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, north of the Sha ports. Because foreign ships are resented by certain parties and secretly obstructed, business is slow. In the middle of last month, it joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route and obtained special permission from the authorities to enter the Zhenhai blockade line, allowing it to directly reach the north bank of Jiangbei and dock at the Moufu Wharf, providing convenience for passengers and merchants. As a result, the return freight is crowded. This city has been relying on the No. 4 Wharf on the Bund of Wuma Road, but due to the large amount of cargo being loaded and unloaded, the cargo cannot be loaded in time and is temporarily stacked on the shore or placed on the dock trestle, often violating the wharf management regulations of the Municipal Council. Customers often express dissatisfaction with the fines. The company</p>
<p>For the Satisfaction of Customers</p>
<p>Now it is decided to change the berth to the Observatory Wharf outside the Yangjingbang Bund of the French Concession. Yesterday at dawn, the ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and changed the berth to the Observatory Wharf. The unloading of goods has always been contracted by a foreman from Jiangbei named Hu Le (named Jinli). There are other contractors, nicknamed Xiaogaoyou and Zheng Lantai, etc., for the Observatory Wharf stevedores. This decision to change the berth to the Observatory Wharf and unload the goods should be done by Xiaogaoyou, etc. However, in order to be skilled in loading and unloading goods, the company contacted the legal person responsible for managing the wharf and obtained his permission in advance to still use Hu Le's workers. After arriving at the port around 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the foreman sent Liu Afu to the wharf</p>
<p>To Pay Wages and Unload Cargo</p>
<p>But Xiaogaoyou, etc., seeing that their work at the wharf had been taken away, were very unhappy and stepped forward to stop them. There was a brief conflict at the time. Xiaogaoyou, etc., beat Liu Afu and then fled. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 p.m., they gathered another forty or fifty workers and returned to the wharf to cause trouble, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. There were two scenes of beatings on the wharf and on the shore, and the situation was serious. The French Concession police received a report and immediately dispatched Chinese and Vietnamese police to the scene to suppress the situation. But the two sides were fighting fiercely and could not be separated for a while. The police then aimed</p>
<p>and Fired Four Shots to Disperse the Crowd</p>
<p>Seven people were arrested at the time, four from Xiaogaoyou's side and three from Hu's foreman's side. The three were released after brief questioning at the police station because they were passive. According to workers, it is very common to compete for a wharf, so the four from Xiaogaoyou's side were not released last night and will definitely be released today. Four people on Hu Le's side were beaten, Liu Afu was the most seriously injured, his head was pierced by an iron hook in three places, and his lower body was also kicked. Liu Mazi was also seriously injured. They each went to the hospital. After bandaging, they returned home. In addition, Yang Wu and Fang Agen suffered minor injuries and continued to work at the wharf after the incident. It is heard that someone has mediated the dispute between the two sides and that Hu Le will be responsible for the work of the "Changde," while the work of other ships docking at the wharf should still be done by Xiaogaoyou, etc.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Train Fare Increased Again, Customs Gold Conversion Rate Increased Again</h3>
<p>The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, from Fangcheng to Yunnan, has train fares combined from two currencies: Vietnamese currency and Customs Gold. The Vietnamese section is calculated in Vietnamese currency, while the Chinese section is calculated in Customs Gold. The conversion rate between Customs Gold and Vietnamese currency was originally 2.9 yuan per Customs Gold, but according to a telegram from Kunming, the conversion rate has increased to 3.45 yuan. Therefore, the fare from Fangcheng to Yunnan has also increased accordingly. Here is a list of the fares for each class:</p>
<p>Fares for Each Class</p>
<p>First class one-way is 103.31 yuan in Vietnamese currency, round trip is 131.24 yuan; second class one-way is 70.47 yuan in Vietnamese currency, round trip is 95.01 yuan; third class one-way is 40.7 yuan in Vietnamese currency, round trip is 51.22 yuan; fourth class one-way is 14.23 yuan in Vietnamese currency, no round trip tickets are sold.</p>
<p>Baggage Fees</p>
<p>Regarding the baggage policy, each person is allowed to carry 30 kilograms of free baggage. For overweight baggage, the fee for first, second, and third class passengers was originally 33 yuan per 100 kilograms, but has now increased to 38 yuan, which can be handed over to the station for tagging. For fourth class passengers, the fee was originally 16 yuan per 100 kilograms, but has now increased to 18 yuan, and they must take care of it themselves. The railway bureau does not provide transportation. In addition, according to the regulations of the railway bureau, those who purchase fourth class tickets from Fangcheng to Kunming are not allowed to get off at Hanoi and must change trains to Lao Cai at Jia Lin. The regulation has now been canceled.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital on Shandong Road held its annual meeting of sponsors at 5:30 PM yesterday. Many directors and male and female sponsors of the hospital attended.

<h3>Municipal Council Meeting This Thursday Noon, Fan Keling Does Not Intend to Attend</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council will hold a meeting at its premises at noon on Thursday, one day after the annual meeting of taxpayers. It is heard that Mr. Fan Keling, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, does not intend to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>"Special Police" for Roads Built Beyond the Settlement to Be Established Next Month; Municipal Council Says Further Understanding Needed; Japanese Side Declares Negotiations Have Been Very Effective</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the "special police" for roads built beyond the settlement will be organized and established next month. The Municipal Council stated that representatives of the Council and the puppet government have been holding bi-weekly meetings to discuss various difficult issues. There is a possibility of understanding between the two sides, and the resolution of various difficulties is expected. However, discussions on this matter do not guarantee that the "special police" will be organized and established in the near future. However, the number of meetings between the two sides is expected to increase in order to obtain a deeper understanding. However, the Japanese side is heavily promoting that the negotiations have been a great success.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Police Uncover Large-Scale Child Trafficking Ring in Hongkou; More Than One Hundred Children Trafficked; Fifteen Families Identify Their Children Through Photos and Clothes</h3>
<p>Yang Xinzheng, a Chinese detective from the Jiading Road Police Station, along with detectives Zhang Decai and Western detective Divil, recently uncovered the largest human trafficking ring in Shanghai's history at locations such as the Fuxinxiang Tobacco and Grocery Store at 355 Baoding Road, Zhoujiazui Road 350, and Dongyouheng Road 103 in Hongkou. The size and scale of the ring are</p>
<p>Truly Rare in Cases Cracked by the Police. Ten suspects have been detained, including Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhang, Dai Lu, Wang Li Fu, Wang Wu, Cui Teng, Wang Zhang, Lu Wenzhong, Zhuge Chun, and Zhuge Qian. Two trafficked boys, seven-year-old Zhang Dingfu and six-year-old Chuan Bingkui, were recovered and handed over to the Special No. 1 Court for questioning and detention. During the investigation, the police learned that the suspects had trafficked approximately one hundred boys in total. This is because more than one hundred pieces of children's clothing were found at the suspects' locations. Most of the trafficked children were</p>
<p>Sold to Other Areas. Since a travel permit is now required to travel from Shanghai to other areas, the police followed this clue and found more than one hundred small photos of children taken by the suspects at two photo studios, 420 Huade Road and 652 Dongxi Huade Road. Police detectives invited the families of the trafficked children to identify the photos and the recovered clothing.</p>
<p>Families Able to Identify Their Children</p>
<p>Included Yuan Kuihua, Shen Caifa, Lin Chen, Qi Renjin, Xi Fuhai, Xiao Chen, Chu Chen, Yin Yongshou, Zhang Amao, Mao Shen, Weng Wu, Lin Yaoxiang, Zhang Ji, Gu Zhidong, Yu Lin, and fifteen other families. However, their lost children had already been trafficked to other areas. It is estimated that there are many more whose children could not be found. The police are continuing their investigation to ensure that the trafficked children can be reunited with their families. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit, stating that the cases committed by the defendants in this case</p>
<p>Numbered No Less Than One Hundred. Currently, only two trafficked persons, Zhang Dingkang and Chuan Bingkui, have been recovered, and fifteen families have identified their children through clothing. However, these children have all been sold. This case is the largest trafficking case cracked by the police in history. These people separated families and caused such suffering, and their crimes are unforgivable. However, a detailed investigation</p>
<p>Is Necessary To Verify Each Child and This Will Take Time. Therefore, it is requested that the defendants be detained and the trial be postponed for another two weeks. Judge Qian Peishen approved the request and ordered the</p>
<p>Defendants To Be Detained and the Trial To Be Postponed for Two Weeks. The police station hopes that if any children have been trafficked and have not yet been found, their families should go to the Jiading Road Police Station to identify photos and clothing in order to assist the police in their investigation.</p>

<h3>After Gong Congdao's Death, Wives and Concubines Contend for Property - First Wife Files Suit to Confirm Status</h3>
<p>Ding Congdao (also known as Mu Sheng, 　Song), a native of this county, worked at the International Savings Society and accumulated some savings. He married Zhu Shuying and had a son and two daughters with her: son Bao Yuan, daughters Die Fen and Bing Fen. They lived together at No. 15, Lane 154, Carter Road. However, nine years ago, Ding took Wu Huizhen, the daughter of a prominent Wu family, as a concubine. She lived with him at No. 215, Mouming Road, and Ding adopted a son with her named Bao An. This matter was known to relatives and friends. On March 5th of this year, Ding suddenly</p>
<p>died of an acute illness at Wu's residence. The police were notified, and the Special First Court's Supervisory Office ordered an official examination, which confirmed that Ding had died of illness. After Ding's death, the assets he left behind were stored in bank safe deposit boxes. Ding's wife, Zhu, then applied to the court for a certificate of guardianship of the estate. However, Ding's concubine, Wu, argued that although she was a concubine and had an adopted son, she was legally entitled to a share of the inheritance. Ding's wife, Zhu, refused to acknowledge the status of Wu and her son, so the court instructed them to first determine their respective statuses. Ding's wife, Zhu, then hired lawyers Yu Hualong to file a lawsuit against Ding's concubine, Wu, and Ding Bao An, to</p>
<p>confirm their identities. Ding's concubine, Wu, and others also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Le Junwei, and Huang Xiubo to defend their case, arguing that Wu had been with Ding for nine years, which was an undeniable fact, and that Zhu had always been aware of it and had even visited them. Therefore, she should not be allowed to deny Wu's status. Consequently, Wu and her son are legally entitled to a share of Ding Congdao's estate. They requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Yesterday, Judge Tao Dejun heard the case in the Civil First Court, questioning both parties extensively on their disputed statuses. The judge then adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<h3>University Student Lu Dacheng Investigates Aunt for Encroachment on Real Estate - Illegal Transfer of Ancestral Sand Land Deeds - Defendant Denies Encroachment, Claims it was Dowry</h3>
<p>Lu Dacheng, a 24-year-old Guanghua University student residing at No. 4, Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road, in the French Concession, and the grandson of the late Lu Fangutang, owner of Lu Bao Xing Pawnshop in Chongming Paiyazhen, has recently hired lawyers Ge Zhiqin and Wang Xiaowen to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against his aunt, Shi Lu Jingyun, accusing her of encroaching on real estate and clothing. He is requesting that the court investigate and prosecute her according to the law, and is also seeking the return of the encroached property rights and evidence in a civil suit. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff recently discovered while examining the</p>
<p>property deeds from his late father, Lu Jianchang, that the deeds for 2.9703 qing of Ping An sand land in Chongming County and 4.976 fen of Yongfeng sand land in Qidong County were missing (referring to the land title deeds in Shanghai). After consulting with the grain bureaus in Chongming and Qidong, he learned that the ownership of the aforementioned Ping An sand land had been changed to Shi Lu Jingyun in the eighth year of the Republic (1919), and the ownership of Yongfeng sand land had been changed from the name of his great-grandfather Lu Taichu to Shi Lu Jingyun in the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929). It is known that the defendant is the daughter of Lu Sun, the concubine of the plaintiff's late grandfather Lu Nianqiao, and is thus</p>
<p>the plaintiff's aunt. The plaintiff's late step-grandmother, Sun, often resided with the defendant and carried all her gold, silver, clothing, cash, and bankbooks with her, entrusting them to the defendant for safekeeping. The plaintiff's late step-grandmother, Sun, died at the defendant's residence last year. The defendant then used the entrusted evidence to</p>
<p>claim that the plaintiff's late step-grandmother had debts and demanded that the plaintiff repay them as a condition for returning the entrusted items. The plaintiff had no choice but to comply. However, the defendant only returned a packet of evidence and a bankbook, while keeping the cash and clothing. After commissioning a lawyer,</p>
<p>letters of negotiation were ineffective. The plaintiff requests investigation and a judgment ordering the return of the items. The defendant Shi Lu Jingyun's husband, Shi Shucheng, is also a wealthy businessman from Chongming. His father, Shi Run, served as a probationary official in Hubei Province. According to the report, a court hearing was held once, but the defendant did not appear due to illness, and the hearing was adjourned. These details have been reported in this newspaper. This case was heard again by Judge Li Weishen in court yesterday morning. The plaintiff and his lawyer appeared in court and stated that</p>
<p>a detailed list of the encroached items has been submitted. The defendant and her lawyer, Lu 　, appeared in court and stated that the Ping An sand land was a dowry given to her when she got married, and the Yongfeng sand land was purchased from Huang Xiuzhai, and the purchase contract was submitted as evidence. The defendant also stated that Huang Xiuzhai is currently in Shanghai and can be summoned to testify. She also stated that she does not have any clothing left in her possession, and that any clothing she had has already been returned. After reviewing the testimonies, the court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<h3>News from the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China</h3>
<p>(　　Communication) The Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China began investigating Chinese biology and conducting systematic research from its inception. Since moving to Beibei, Sichuan, in addition to continuing its past work, it has also focused on economic and practical applications. The following is a brief description of its work and research trends over the past two years:</p>
<p>(1) Classification Research and Investigation Work: A. Expanding 　long-term monographs, such as the Yangtze River and the Fauna of the Chinese Coast, the Flora of Zhejiang, Nanjing, and Sichuan, and the Flora of Chinese Conifers and 　Formaceae. B. Biological surveys in the rear areas. In the past two years, the areas covered were Nanchuan, the Qingyi River, and the Hongya River basin (including Tianquan, Baoxing, and Wawu Mountain), the Dadu River basin (including Wawu Mountain and Mount Emei), and the lower reaches of the Jialing River. (2) Experimental and Economic Research: Since 1938, the botanical aspect of this work has focused on compiling two economically important publications: A. An Atlas of Chinese Forests; B. An Atlas of Chinese Medicinal Plants. The first volume of both has been published, and work has begun on an Atlas of Chinese Wild Edible Plants. The zoological research covers parasitic protozoa in livestock and humans, pests of crops, vegetables, and forest plants, and edible fish. The investigation of natural forests continues to identify sources of raw forest materials for those who need them. The habits and control of forest insects and the parasitic protozoa of humans and livestock are also being studied. (3) Physiological and Biochemical Research: Physiological research focuses on the cytology of the nervous system, metabolism, and other functions under normal and experimental conditions. Research is also being conducted on the functions of the cerebral cortex and the types of substances required for the oxidation of neuromuscular functions. The institute is currently located in one of the most famous provinces for medicinal materials, so the botany department is paying close attention to them. It is currently trying to extract pure substances using chemical methods, and then use physiological methods and field experiments to observe their effects and effectiveness on higher and lower plants and animals. Biochemical research is focused on the analysis of Chinese food materials, their caloric content, and their nutritional value, so that the Chinese people have a reliable source of information to follow and use. (4) Cooperation with Other Organizations: The institute strives to assist the government and various academic institutions in any way it can. For example, it is assisting the Jiangxi Provincial Economic Commission in surveying aquatic products, the Resources Committee in surveying grasslands suitable for animal husbandry, the Sichuan Construction Department in surveying forests suitable for railroad ties, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in surveying forest conditions and sources of papermaking materials in various locations, as well as Nanchuan County in studying the degradation of bamboo shoots.</p>

<h3>Finance: Japanese Banks and Speculators Continue Activity in Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. In the gray market, British and American exchange rates remained tight, and most people continued to expect a decline, due to the positive impact of the European war and environment. Although exchange rates initially fell, the opening prices for British and American exchange rates were flat, because the previous day's trading had been small. Initially, speculators were eager to sell, and the spot U.S. dollar once fell by six yuan. However, buyers soon followed, and foreign firms and cotton importers had a strong demand for settlement. Speculators took the opportunity to buy, and Japanese banks were active in between, creating a strong buying trend, pushing prices up gradually. Although Hong Kong Electric slightly sold off in the morning, and HSBC's supply of spot sterling was very large, prices rebounded due to the renewed activity of Japanese banks and speculators. The market remained soft. The afternoon started quietly, with little trading, only speculators engaging in swap transactions. Then, speculators slightly released their long positions for the current month, so prices uniformly eased. Until the evening close, the market lacked excitement. As a result, British gold closed at 4 shillings and 125 pence, and the U.S. dollar was 5.9375 yuan, a slight increase of 0.03125 compared to the previous day's evening close.

<p>Distinguishing Illnesses Caused by Eating Wheat (Part 2)</p>
<p>Some say that northern wheat blooms in the daytime, while southern wheat blooms at night, making it of a yin and cold nature. If a sick person eats yin and cold foods, it will inevitably cause stagnation. However, the flower of wheat is extremely small and subtle. Who can observe it day and night to know that its nature differs between the north and south? Speaking of the seasons, rice sprouts in spring, is planted in summer, and matures in autumn, only experiencing three of the four seasons. Wheat, on the other hand, is sown in the autumn of the previous year and harvested in the summer of the following year, truly experiencing the qi of all four seasons. Its ability to nourish and harmonize the body is certainly no less than that of rice. Speaking of the land, northerners plant wheat in exhausted soil, only able to mix it with other grains to harvest what remains. Southerners, after harvesting rice, immediately mound soil around the rice roots to plant wheat. In spring, they plow and divide the fields into rows, and in summer, they harvest the wheat and plant rice again. This land can yield two crops a year. Compared to the yield of a single crop, how can southern wheat be inferior to northern wheat, and why should it be said that southerners must not eat wheat? Furthermore, speaking of the nature of things, generally speaking, foods that are firm and tough are difficult to digest, while those that are loose and soft are easily digested. However, I have personally tested that when people make wine or soy sauce, they place wheat in a shaded area and cover it with rice straw. During the unpredictable weather of the fourth and fifth months, it changes color in half a month. When squeezed by hand, it easily turns into ash. But when making rice koji, it must go through autumn, winter, and spring, and the rice only floats on water instead of sinking. Therefore, in terms of nature, rice is firmer than wheat. Speaking of human effort, grinding wheat into flour and mixing it with wine can make the steamed flour loose and more than half as high as the original dough. Some also mix it with eggs to make cakes. The same goes for steamed buns. If fried in oil, it is also loose, crispy, and not greasy. However, rice flour becomes firmer the more it is mixed. Even oil, wine, and eggs cannot be used to improve it. Judging by these four aspects, is eating rice superior to eating wheat in terms of ease of digestion and lack of stagnation?</p>

<h3>The Life of a Lunchbox</h3>
<p>— Ciyun</p>
<p>A lunchbox whose price has risen from one yuan to two yuan is filled with food every morning and taken out, then brought back empty every evening. I have been living this life, similar to that of a silk-reeling woman, for three or four months now.</p>
<p>In the hurried mornings, I fill the clean lunchbox with nearly three bowls of white rice, and some vegetables in a half-moon-shaped compartment. I close the lid tightly, wrap it in newspaper, and that's my food for the meal.</p>
<p>After twelve o'clock at noon, I pour boiling water over the rice twice. The solid rice is loosened by the hot water. The vegetables are cold, so I just scoop them into my mouth with a spoon, without using a bowl, and that's my lunch.</p>
<p>The cost of filling a lunchbox with food is not cheap, and it adds a lot of trouble: the night before, the family has to specially cook the rice for tomorrow and carefully set it aside. The cooked vegetables must also be treated with care and set aside to prevent them from going sour. In the morning, I put the prepared food into the lunchbox. At noon, I heat it up with boiling water, eat the meal, and then have to wash the box myself.</p>
<p>Speaking of the cost, it's not cheap at all. Filling my stomach with three bowls of white rice is still not enough! And the side dishes? They can't be too shabby, so I have to bring a little meat dish every day. If I calculate like this, each meal costs at least forty cents. Although it's troublesome, the price isn't cheap, but it's still better than eating in a restaurant. The dishes cooked at home always suit my taste.</p>
<p>Everyone comes out of their homes with a lunchbox full of food under their arm, feeling humble, as if they're in danger of having their secret discovered at any moment. Even on crowded sidewalks or in buses, you can always find "fellow travelers." Everyone understands each other tacitly. And when you see someone wearing an authentic Western suit also carrying a lunchbox, your uneasy heart seems to calm down a little.</p>
<p>The sharp waves of life are affecting everyone. The most awkward people to deal with are salaried employees. They belong to the "scholar-official" class, but their lives are too miserable. Their actions and behavior must be "scholar-official"-like, but the rewards they receive are too pitiful. So, eating a bitter meal from a lunchbox every day is perhaps already considered a blessing?</p>
<h3>What I Hope From Evening Continuation Schools</h3>
<p>— Yuanshan</p>
<p>After reading the two articles "How Many Days of School in a Year?" and "Exactly How Many Days of School in a Year?", we students at continuation schools couldn't help but feel a multitude of emotions.</p>
<p>Although students in regular day schools have many holidays, they still have more opportunities for education. Students in continuation schools, on the other hand, are mostly young people in the workforce who, after laboring hard during the day, attend continuation schools in the morning or evening to study for one or two hours to satisfy their thirst for knowledge. The value of their time is self-evident. Generally speaking, each class in a continuation school lasts about fifty minutes, and most Saturdays have no classes. So, if we were to have as many holidays as regular day schools, the amount of learning in a semester would be very little. Therefore, I hope that all continuation schools can hold classes as usual, except for Sundays.</p>
<p>Another point that should be mentioned is that most teachers in continuation schools are part-time. While there are certainly many who arrive on time to teach, it is not uncommon for some to be five or ten minutes late. Doesn't this cause losses for the students? Therefore, I hope that teachers in continuation schools who cannot arrive on time due to other matters should voluntarily withdraw from their position rather than waste other people's time. Although this would mean less income, they could avoid feeling guilty.</p>
<p>The above two points are what we earnestly hope the authorities of general evening continuation schools can actively improve.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Hearing Important Information from Afar, Reverent Discussions and Grand Theories of Human Beliefs</p>
<p>He Liyu said: Advertising is a major source of income, and if there is also a surplus in distribution, wouldn't that be a double source of revenue for the newspaper business? Qu Wushuang said: "But in our newspaper, we can profit from distribution but choose not to. Why? It's another kind of regulation. The paper is stipulated to be at most four large sheets, and the price is also stipulated to be at most five cents. If we sold it for five cents, we would have a surplus in distribution a long time ago. But we still only sell it for four cents, because newspapers are a cultural enterprise, seeking to be accessible throughout the country. And our country is a newly emerging nation, and the people strive to save, and their purchasing power is not sufficient. Naturally, saving one cent is still one cent. In the past, when we published three sheets, we sold it for three cents, and now when we publish four sheets, we sell it for four cents. Fortunately, there is income from advertising, and there is also a surplus. However, our surplus is all used for the expansion of the newspaper. Isn't the state currently enacting a law that no matter what kind of industry or commerce it is, it can only have a surplus of ten percent after expenses? But if it is for business expansion, that is acceptable, especially for cultural enterprises. So, we put all of our annual surplus into business expansion." Wu Junsu said: "Then the newspaper's income relies entirely on advertising and distribution?" Qu Wushuang said: "No! We also have side businesses. These side businesses are divided into two main parts, one part is for publications and the other part is for non-publications. The publication part includes over a thousand kinds of periodicals we publish, from weeklies to quarterlies. Sister Junsu has probably seen many of them. In addition, there are also books we publish, as well as short novels and plays extracted from daily newspapers and magazines and published as separate books. And maps are produced in very large quantities every year. World maps, national maps, provincial maps, and county maps can be said to be emerging one after another. And the newer a map is, the more expensive it is. In the past, once a map was published in China, it never changed, which was ridiculous. Now we must review and revise various maps once a year, and as soon as the newly revised map is published, the old map has to retire and be stored in the library museum. So even the newly revised map cannot be printed in large quantities, but only enough for what is needed in a year, to prevent it from having to be revised again next year. But even so, the maps we need every year often make us unable to print them in time. Sister Junsu! Think about it! Recently, education has developed in our country, and just the large and small schools alone need so many maps, not to mention other organizations. Surely teachers cannot show students old maps now, can they?" Truly:</p>
<p>Why travel all over the world? Just point to the mountains and rivers. (264)</p>
<h3>The Dark Side of Job Seeking</h3>
<p>— Qianche</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen many reports in the newspapers exposing the dark side of job seeking. Although the "methods" used are different, such as recruiting staff and seeking cooperation, the only condition is to swindle security deposits or investments. In the wave of unemployment, they are squeezing the "eager to find work" unemployed. Simply exposing them only stimulates them to think of more clever ways to deceive later victims. I believe that the entire process should be reported to the police stations of the two concessions. As for those "flowery" advertisements, I believe that the authorities of the two concessions should add specialized personnel to investigate them. When suspicious "recruiting staff" or "seeking joint ventures" advertisements are discovered, they should immediately conduct on-site investigations, not allowing them the opportunity to "move every day."</p>
<p>At the same time, I would like to say a few words to my "eager to find work" friends: seizing opportunities is certainly your first lesson, but how can you avoid being deceived? This is what you should sit down and think about carefully. For example, if you find an advertisement "recruiting staff," you must first pay attention to what "trade," "company," or "factory" it is, where the address is, what kind of staff it is recruiting, and what the ratio of the salary to the position is. If you find something suspicious, you might as well go to investigate on-site. If it is a reputable and reliable manufacturer, there will definitely not be "a wooden sign," "a messy office," or "the official who comes out with a fierce look like a hooligan." After everything is quite satisfactory, the second step is to pay attention to how much the application fee is and what the exam questions are like... A fraud can somehow allow careful people to find a flaw.</p>
<p>"Eager to find work" friends, don't think my words are "Monday morning quarterbacking." Remembering these will at least not harm you; and even if it is "Monday morning quarterbacking," "closing the stable door after the horse has bolted" is also a valuable lesson!</p>
<h3>"Selling at Cost"</h3>
<p>— Pianmo</p>
<p>(Above omitted) "Selling coal briquettes at cost...supplying 1,500 dan every day." This is such a pleasant and moving benevolent act! But if everyone thinks about the actual situation, they can see how they are playing tricks! Coal briquettes are now limited to 30 cents per person, which is five and a half pounds. That is, 100 pounds is nearly six yuan. Let's not discuss whether this price is cheap for the time being. According to their rules for selling at cost, each family is only allowed to buy five and a half pounds of coal every day, so even if someone spends time every day to buy it within the ten-day period, they will only buy 55 pounds of coal. After spending ten days of effort, the amount saved is only 50 cents. How much does this differ from the market price of seven yuan per dan, including delivery?</p>
<h3>Jesus' Concept of Gratitude (1)</h3>
<p>Jesus was having supper with his disciples in a small house in Jerusalem. Although most of them did not quite understand how things were, for Jesus' work and the future of this group, this was indeed a very dangerous time. Their supper together this time was to be their last. At this moment, they had to make a big decision to choose a difficult path to follow. Jesus was as if standing at a crossroads of his preaching work. He knew that the cross was in front of him, a symbol of shame, a method of punishing criminals, which anyone who knew how to love himself would not want to endure. Moreover, Jesus had not done anything wrong, nor had he spoken deceitful words. He had served society for three years, bringing good news to the common people, making the blind see, and comforting all who were heartbroken. Why should he suffer the cruel torture of the cross? There was a reason for this, which was that it could bring happiness to billions of lives and show how the loving Father loved his children. Being crucified was already humiliating to the extreme. Before being nailed, he had to endure all kinds of insults. From a human point of view, this was truly unbearable. But what did Jesus do? He picked up the cup and gave thanks." According to himself, the cup represented all the suffering he had to endure. In this way, Jesus' concept of gratitude is very different from ours. Most people's gratitude is for celebrating their own material success. For example, the Pharisee thanked God in the temple because he was superior to others. The rich man thanked God because his warehouse was full, enough for many months of food. They had no sense of gratitude and no sense of responsibility towards others. Relatively speaking, a person who has achieved material success is more likely to have a grateful heart and is also more likely to have a sense of complacency and contentment. The most pitiful people in the world are those who have gained unexpected wealth without effort and say with self-satisfaction, "My warehouse is full, I can be generous and offer a little to God." There are indeed many, many people like this in the world. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Entertainment World</p>
<h3>A New Performance of "One-Legged Film"</h3>
<p>— Weite</p>
<p>We know that in the entertainment world of Shanghai, there are performers who sing "one-legged plays," which is a performance of gestures and movements by one person. Now, at the New York World's Fair, there is actually a person performing a film, which is hard to name, so let's call it "one-legged film." This thing is also very novel, and now I will introduce it below:</p>
<p>The performer (who may not be a movie star) sits in a small room, with a strong arc lamp shining on his face. The image of his face is reflected by a tilted plane mirror, and through a condensing lens and a magnifying glass, it reaches two larger plane mirrors. Finally, one plane mirror reverses the "image" onto a small silver screen, so the audience can see the various expressions on the performer's face. Even the performer's speaking and singing can be picked up by another microphone and transmitted to the audience's ears by a loudspeaker, just as if the audience is enjoying a sound film. According to the inventor, William Hevrehaft, the "image" shown on this screen can be magnified 30 times compared to the original!</p>
<h3>International Children's Music Competition</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>——The Four Little Chinese Friends Have Hope of Winning</p>
<p>The term "International Children's Music Competition" is rarely heard in Shanghai. About a month ago, the Boys' Division of the Shanghai YMCA held a "National Children's Music Competition." More than 40 children participated in the competition, with piano, violin, and vocal categories. The competition was held in the auditorium of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. As a result, several outstanding young artists were unanimously judged by a dozen or so famous musicians as winners and received prizes.</p>
<p>Now, the YMCA is continuing its efforts and preparing to hold another "International Children's Music Competition" in mid-May. It is said that the qualifications for this competition are very strict. The representatives of Chinese children are the winners of the previous competition. As for those invited from other countries, they are all excluded.</p>
<p>The competition committee is organized by famous musicians and professors in Shanghai. They have decided to invite about 20 contestants to participate in the competition. The program is still divided into three categories: piano, violin, and vocal.</p>
<p>In this competition, the Chinese children participating in the piano category are Wu Yili, Zhang Yi'an, Wang Zhilan, and Hu Youcang. Wu Yili is the youngest and the champion of the last competition, a top student of Mrs. Li Bowen. This time she is preparing to play Chopin's Minuet Waltz (which is the one played by the eleven young girls in the film "Qing Ping Yue"). In addition, Zhang Yi'an, Wang Zhilan, and Hu Youcang are all top students of famous piano professors Zahalov and Mr. Ding Shande. They are all very hopeful in this competition and can raise the prestige of the Chinese people. Liu Zhongchi, who is participating in the violin category, will play a concerto, which is rarely seen among children. As for Liang Zhiyong and Liang Linkai, who are participating in the vocal category, they also have their own special talents.</p>
<p>On the day of the competition, the elite of the Chinese people in Shanghai will form a large-scale symphony orchestra, conducted by Mr. Huang Yongxi, to perform Haydn's Symphony No. 104, which is probably a major achievement in Shanghai's music scene this year.</p>
<p>The location is probably in the China Youth Hall. (The rumor that it is in the Foreign Youth Hall is actually wrong.)</p>
<h3>Famous Actors Are Coming One After Another</h3>
<p>— Weiwei</p>
<p>According to recent news, six groups of famous actors will come to perform in the south this year, and have been successfully negotiated by Huang Jin. Their names are as follows:</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang: Ma Lianliang is now scheduled to come to Shanghai in May, succeeding the current Qiu Zhixian troupe. In addition to the female role Zhang Junqiu, the young male role Ye Sheng'lan, the comedian Ma Fulu, and the painted face Liu Lianrong, Wu Yanheng and Yuan Shihai have also joined, showing a wealth of talent. It is said that he will perform "Five Colorful Auspicious Omens," a secret play from Liancheng, as well as the entire set of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Mao Shilai: Shilai was very popular when he came to Shanghai last time. The old male actor who will come with him this time is Chi Shigong. Chi is the grandson of the old actor Chi Zijun, with a family background and considerable skill. With Shigong as a partner, Shilai will surely achieve the effect of peony and green leaves.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng: The rumor that Xun Huisheng is coming to Shanghai has been circulating for a long time, but it has not yet come to fruition. It is now learned that with the help of certain gentlemen, Huisheng has responded to Huang Jin's invitation and will come to Shanghai to perform after the autumn coolness. Those who will come with him include the old male actor Wang Wenyuan, the young male actor Xu Hecai, the comedian Ma Fulu, the painted face Jiang Shao Kui, the old female role Sun Futing, and the old male actor Chen Xixing.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying: Tan will come to Shanghai to perform after Xun Huisheng, scheduled for around the ninth month of the lunar calendar. The female role will be Zhang Junqiu, the comedian Ru Fuhui, the painted face Wang Quankui, the young male role Jiang Miaoxiang, and the martial male role Yang Shengchun will also come with him.</p>
<p>Nan Tiesheng: Nan Tiesheng is scheduled to come to Shanghai again in late autumn and early winter this year. The old male actor has been confirmed to be Yang Baosen, and the young male actor has been confirmed to be Yu Zhenfei. It is heard that Tiesheng has recently been asking Wang Yaoqing for advice in Beijing, and he is working very hard. When he comes south, he will surely have new contributions.</p>
<p>Ye Shengzhang: The martial comedian Ye Shengzhang has not come again since he came south to perform at the opening of the Rongji Grand Stage in 1934. Huang Jin will invite Shengzhang and his younger brother Shengshichang to come to Shanghai at the end of this year. Shi Chang works as an old male actor, and his skills are no less than those of Chi Shigong. He is also an outstanding member of the Liancheng Five Schools. As for the female role, Li Shifang has been confirmed.</p>

<h3>Movie and Drama Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Yu Feng Has Quietly Gone to Guilin: Yu Feng, daughter of Mr. Yu Mantuo, the president of the Special Zone Court who died in the line of duty (namely, the niece of Yu Dafu), and a former member of the amateur experimental theater group, is good at painting and writing. She returned to Shanghai in the middle of last month to mourn her father. When someone asked her how she felt about Mr. Mantuo's death, she replied: This only increases my determination to work for the country. She has now quietly gone to Hong Kong and transferred to work in Guilin.</p>
<p>Zhou Liu Discuss Cooperation: According to reports, Zhou Jianyun and Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, had an important conversation the night before. Reporters speculate that it was to discuss issues related to the new company.</p>
<p>Lan Lan Appears on the Silver Screen for the Third Time: In "Black Paradise," Wu Cun asked Lan Lan to play an important role, a passionate red dancer. Filming began yesterday.</p>
<p>Dramatic Arts Society Has Satisfactory Cooperation: The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society is a professional theater group after the war. Since signing a cooperation agreement with the Lafei Theater on December 10th last year, the attendance rate has been above the standard for nearly four months. The theater owner, Huang Guande, quite admires the serious attitude of the Dramatic Arts Society. The contract between the two parties expires on June 20th.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Hua Yun in "Fighting Taiping" is a Mistake for Hua Yun (Middle)</p>
<p>I, your humble servant, am aware that the play "Fighting Taiping" is already well-known and frequently seen by the audience, unlike when it was first performed as an opening play and was not valued at the time. Therefore, I will point out and correct the mistake that famous actors who have performed in the play over the years have sung the lead role "Hua Yun" as "Hua Yun," so as to avoid it being passed down incorrectly and misleading future students.</p>
<p>According to historical records, what was fought was clearly Hua Yun who defended Taiping City with Zhu Wenxin, which shows that Hua Yun was a real person and also a famous general at the end of the Yuan and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty. Since this play "Fighting Taiping" is intended to extol his loyalty and bravery, it would be too disrespectful to the前辈先生 who arranged this play if even his surname is not clear. I think the famous actors who first sang this play would not have confused the characters Hua and Hua, but later, there were fewer literate people in the acting world, and the teachers in the training classes taught the plays by word of mouth. They did not know how to explain the lyrics, and no one understood the yin and yang of the characters. When singing, they only wanted to make it easy to sing and just wanted to sell their voices, hoping to win applause. With yin and yang reversed, who would care? Liu Hongsheng committed this kind of mistake, so he was never considered a first-class famous actor. Experts only praised his loud voice, but as for his full mouth of Beijing dialect, he did not understand the method of "using words to convey meaning." This is exactly the same as how a certain old male actor, who is famous for nothing, sings everything in the same monotonous style. The three words "General Hua Yun" in "Fighting Taiping" are sung in a particularly elevated way, which is indeed a place to sell the voice. Especially when the character "Hua" is sung in the rising tone, using the sound of "Hua," which is even higher than the character "General," it is easy to resonate and not very laborious.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xuan's New Contract</h3>
<p>— From Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan's contract with Liguohua Film Company expires at the end of April. Both parties are still negotiating the signing of a new contract. This reporter once visited Miss Zhou regarding this matter. According to her, the continuation of the contract is likely not a problem. However, the contract signed later will not be a long-term contract, but rather based on the number of films. This is because it is less restrictive. Her husband, Yan Hua, is currently jointly running a gramophone needle company with several friends. It has already started business and has received many orders. They originally lived on Jessfield Road, but for the convenience of work, they moved to Route Mgr. Froc yesterday.</p>
