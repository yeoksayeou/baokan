<p>西藏政敎首長達賴第十三世，於廿二年圓寂後，其後身經藏中當局多方尋訪，始於去夏在靑海紅土崖覓得六齡童子拉木登珠，確認爲達賴轉世，迎載返藏，定於本月廿二日在拉薩舉行坐床大典。國府方面對此舉異常重視，於去秋任命吳忠信入藏主持達賴轉世事宜，刻已行抵拉薩，受藏中僧俗熱烈隆重的歡迎，最近更明令特准拉木登珠繼任第十四世達賴喇嘛，撥款四十萬元充大典經費。這種種舉措，都是自西藏與祖國疏隔以來的空前盛舉；中央對邊疆的關切，與藏民對祖國的效忠，都可從這些事實中體認出來，報載重慶各界準備於即位大典之日舉行盛大慶祝，足見此屆達賴的即位，其本身雖係關西藏一地敎位之遞嬗，其意義之重大則絕非等閒。</p>
<p>已故的達賴第十三世阿旺羅布藏塔布克嘉穆錯，其個人實爲一個幹練有爲的英主，但他一身的遭際却適逢西藏有史以來最不幸的時代。一方是愚闇專制的滿淸，另方有伺機進侵的外侮，以一個生產落後政敎不分的原始民族周旋其間，其不能應付裕如原是意中事。所以以往中藏關係的離析，達賴身常其衝，固無法辭其愆允，但也難完全歸咎他個人。藏地自民元脫離中國而獨立，民三中英藏三方爲解決西藏問題而召開的西謨拉會議又以意見未盡妥洽而告失敗，到現在將近三十年間，中藏關係實不絕如縷。據說已故達賴晚年也頗具悔禍內嚮之心，終以藏局積重難返，不易振拔，抑鬱而歿。其唯一能繼而收拾藏局的班禪大師復以返藏問題橫生梗阻，客死道途。今幸達賴後身尋獲，藏中政局將重歸安定，中國亦以堅決抗戰而聲威大著，國際地位旣因以提高，邊民內嚮亦日趨殷切，致中藏關係得由疏隔而復親密，開三十年來的新紀元，這自然是中藏人民所應同感欣幸的事。</p>
<p>已往西藏之與中國離析，一般人都認爲是英方誘致之過，其實那只是問題的一面。十九世紀末年，英國的對藏政策曾有過積極的一頁。而當一八八八和一九零三年英軍兩度侵入藏境時。藏人抗拒極烈，對英實無好感可言。其後所以化讐爲友，轉而求助於英者，則全係淸廷應付失當所致。當滿淸盛時，其理藩政策不外以武力鎭壓與優禮覊糜二者交互爲用，邊民則怵於武力的强盛，首長則惑於禮數的優異，亦遂相安於無形。及至末葉，淸廷的威望已歸陵夷，而其驕矜自大反有增無减，加以駐防官吏，大多爲貪汚昏愚者流，唯圖貨利自私，對於邊民疾苦漠不關心，藩屬遂因怨望而携貳，迨在邊省推行新政，當局復吹求甚厲，罔顧邊民的習俗與感情，遂益予搆煽者以可乘之機。外蒙西藏的脫離中國，此實爲其主因；老賓說，他們所要背叛的是淸廷，對於中國並不一定有何反感。單就西藏情形來看；當藏中僧民慘遭外侮侵陵的時候，淸吏一味對外屈服，坐視不欽，而對於藏中僧民所共同愛戴的達賴，旣不能於其出亡期中加以優容禮遇，助其返藏，反而凌辱有加，一再以革去封號相威嚇，致其於窮蹙之餘，不惜求助外援。及至趙爾豐率兵入藏，以武力鎭壓反側，毀壞廟宇，殘殺僧民，益激起藏民的公憤，藏局遂至不可收拾。縱觀上述經過，可見已往的西藏問題縱有外部的煽誘，主要。原因仍原於淸廷應付邊疆的不善，這一切都正好做爲此後的借鑒。</p>
<p>十三年國民黨改組期間，對於境內少數民族曾發表過慷慨寬大的諾言，國府建都南京後，對邊政亦曾有種種運籌，但都未能收得重大效果。中藏關係的進入新的階段，主要還是中國抗戰以後的事，這也是抗戰過程中中國一個重大收穫。年來藏中僧俗不時出入於前綫後方之問，與內地民衆共同担負宣傳慰勞等工作，藏地各大寺院也不斷從事祈禱，以祝抗戰勝利之早日實現，預計達賴十四世即位而後，雙方關係當愈趨密切。現在中央關於邊疆問題的處理，其基本原則已早經樹立，所需要的只是如何去從事運用正確而堅定的具體政策，再不容重蹈已往之失。另一方面，邊省衆庶也應首先明嘹以抗戰求生存是合中國唯一的迫切問題，除非抗戰獲得勝利，一切局部的利益都無法保持，並且也只有加緊團結，努力抗戰，纔能從中華民族的解放當中獲得自身的解放。此度達賴即位大典的舉行，已在中藏族衆間造成一個合作互助的心理基礎，今後當更加以發揚光大，使正在現代化途徑中的西藏以及其他邊陲族衆，都能相率努力爲祖國宣勞。</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>此不妊之過失是男的還是女的先要明瞭</p>
<p>治療時尤宜診察詳盡否則難免藥不對症</p>
<p>夫婦結婚後而不能生育，確是家庭之隱憂，但此不妊問題，對於時間大有研究，蓋究第婚後經過多少日子而不生子始可認爲在患不妊症呢？因此遂有人這樣規定！如在結婚後經過了三年而還不曾妊娠者，便可確定其在患不妊症了。</p>
<p>至於不奸症之種類，也有幾種區分，在醫學界至少可分爲二種，其一，爲絕對的不妊症，其二爲比較的不妊症。前者，主要的多係起因於先天性者，至屬後天性的，則係爲了疾病的緣故，而致破壞了生殖器之主要部分底組織的。如男子方面的遺精早洩，陰萎腎虧，及性器短小等症。女子月經不調，乳　貧血，發育不全等症均屬之。</p>
<p>最不平等的，就是夫婦間一方患了不妊症之後，竟不分皂白都委責於女子，此種行爲實與現代的醫學不合，蓋現在醫學進步，證明不妊的原因是男女雙方各牛平分，所以欲決定子女的有無，祇須檢查其有吾患上述各症，如丈夫早洩陰痿，發育不全，及女子月經不調，貧血萎黃等症，必須服以眞正雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑男女用「補體康」，良山「補體康」除內合上述之生殖腺素成分之外，尚有補腦之燐質，及補血之鐵質，補骨之鈣質摻入，服後一小時藥力即傳達全體，廿四小時後即發揮補腦，補血，補腎，補精之實效，余爲腎病之專科醫師，本廿年來臨床之經騐所知，補劑咆之功效準確者，捨「補體康」莫屬，余在七年中藉「補體康」而治愈盈千異萬之衰弱不妊者，從未遇失效之一丙列。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師述</p>
<p>科學日新月異，而其既經發現之眞理，則萬古不磨。此事吾人可由從發明淋病特效藥一克淋儂」一藥，即可證明。</p>
<p>蓋「克淋儂」一藥，爲德國淋病學大師彼德博士所發明。彼德博士竭畢生精力，罄無數金錢，最後始根據非特異性療法，探用蛋白體黃色混合製成，歷經無數次之動物試騐，如先以淋毒接種於人猿，然後投以「克淋儂」一藥之原素，結果於五天內治好。其後又　試各種動物，逐步改良，卒成今日舉世風行之淋病物效藥。</p>
<p>現在再略言淋病之狀况，使病家也好領略個中眞相。原來淋病之禍根，是雙球菌，（以其如兩個球相疊的樣子），性極頑梗，而又極富繁殖力，一化而爲二，二化爲四，轉匯之間，已化爲千千萬萬之徒衆。所以吾人不幸自與不潔之女性接觸之後，往往於三四天內，卽發生淋毒，其時之淋菌，尚　集於前尿道，故此時極容易治療，在余臨床上實騐之結果，凡急　淋時服用「克淋儂」者，於當天內見效，一星期內完全斷根。至於慢性淋，如患者已釀成攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，精系炎，睪丸炎等，則因淋菌已侵入後尿道，其內部分岐，治療時較之急性難，若一旦淋菌由海綿體內闖入血液，則淋菌游移各處，如稽留關節，則成爲淋毒性關節炎，此種病患，允非一般市上成藥所能奏功，必須服用「克淋儂」使其全身每個細胞發生抗淋噬菌作用，而完全治愈之。蓋惟「克淋儂」具此功效也。此外如男子外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書，女子外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，每晚用一片插入　道，掃除淋毒性白帶，允合在家自療。此爲最現代化之治淋法。</p>
<p>患者錢雪良，松江人，現年四十一歲（自訴）本人體質素弱，好酒，前年冬月，適友人喜宴，酒醉而回，時值夜深，感受寒冒，由是咳嗽不絕，至去春，濃痰甚多，胸感刺痛，雖經醫治絕無效騐，去秋痰中忽有血點發現，人夜盜汗淋淋，始來余處治療，（治騐經過）余觀錢君面色蒼白，骨瘦如柴，身發高熱，以X光檢查，發現右肺葉有銀錢大之空洞，乃囑其忌食酒類攝常有滋養的食物，並在家靜養，投以「補肺拿爾」以彌補空洞，殺滅結核菌，二個月後咳嗽已治，胸痛盜汗亦無，服至今，諸症全消，血痰已無發現，健康恢復矣</p>

<p>姚菊巖醫師述診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>痛苦，凡是病患者，固無一不具痛苦之感覺；不過痛苦之程度，有輕重而己。在淋病息者中，其痛苦之深，嬰算得最爲難忍。故吾當以「無可比喻之痛苦」，用來比喻淋病患者，最爲恰當。蓋此病在初起時，始則尿道中感到有如蟻走虫行之狀，繼則尿道中灼熱而刺痛，又繼而此種痛苦，益趨劇烈，尿中有如銳利尖針所刺，或爲如沸湯所沃，於病人自然叫苦連天，坐立不安，其痛楚情形，誠非筆墨所能形容。尤其是在尿道炎症正來得熾烈的時候，而想要排泄小便，更使淋病患者痛得上天無路，人地無　。蓋常小便排泄時，尿液經過病灶，受其刺激而痛楚益甚，而尿逍管壁亦因而　縮。如此一來，小便更難排出。故雖用去九牛二虎之力，而依然不能排匯淨盡。尿後往往尙有餘有盡之感，試問任何疾患之痛苦，有若是之慘烈者乎？</p>
<p>不過淋病在急性時，痛苦雖然痛苦，治愈却也很容易。因爲淋菌在急性時大多叢集前尿道故也。故此時如予以淋病特效藥「克淋儂」爲內服劑，使其殺菌力集中於前尿道，同時又能使全體細胞發生抗淋噬菌作用。一方更用德國感應靜電療法，Wellerx線療法，交互爲用，則淋病痛苦雖甚，亦能旦夕止痛，尅日就痊，而永不再發　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之性病全書一册。</p>

<p>字林報云、公共租界警務處長包文少校、將於數日內、與「上海市公安局局長」盧英舉行會議、俾討論工部局與「市府」所汀定西誕特別新警察隊之組織詳則、該隊辦公處地址尚未擇定、</p>
<p>警隊組織尙待協商</p>
<p>據「市長」傅筱菴告記者稱、聯合新警察隊如何組織一節、當由將在數日內舉行之會議、加以討淪、惟會議日期、尚未決定、「市府」對於從西區所得之收入、將用以發展西區一地、饑款仔諸銀行、傳承認渠對財政問題、尚未與公共租界當局詳細討論、</p>
<p>西區發展曾耗鉅資</p>
<p>記者述及公共祖界當局發展西區公共利益業務、曾耗巨資一事、傅乃稱，此項問題提出討論時、渠將索閱盈虧清單、」意即渠將對此前公共租界當局之收人與耗資兩項、加以詳盡之考慮云、</p>
<p>新警官員千二百人</p>
<p>又上海泰唔士報云、關於成滬西越界築路區特別警察隊之協定、旣於星期五日簽訂、昨日（十七日）本市對該隊人數與一般組縱、乃大起揣測、有關雙方對於此事、雖尚未舉行直接討論、惟聞諸可靠負責人士、新警察隊警官與警員、大致為一千二百人、就該隊所轄區域之大小判斷之、該區諒將設警署四所、</p>
<p>警署屋宇尋覓需時</p>
<p>工部局總董樊克令與「上海市長」傳筱菴所訂協定、規定新警察隊之人數與組織事宜、留交「上海市警察局長」與公共租界警務處長辦理、特別警察隊成立後、在協定有效期內、有在越界築路區行事之專權、惟料警察隊之組織、非一時所能籌備竣事、蓋除遴選警官警員而外、並有在該區尋覓適當屋宇、以充警署之問題也、</p>
<p>警員標幟另有規定</p>
<p>星期五日所訂協定之主要特點、為特別警察隊山「市府、設立、而佩顯明之肩章或徽章及在設區有唯一之行使權、繁察隊人員之組織、將山警務處長與「上海市警局長」商定之、</p>
<p>人選問題須待會商</p>
<p>按照臨定條款、警察隊一部份隊員包括若干主要警官在內、應由「上海市腦」在工部局舉荐之候補人員內委派之、無疑的、警務處長與副處長會商後、將經過校久之時間、始能提出警務處警員名單、此等警員、若經「上海市府」核准、即將派入特別警察隊、聞警察隊隊長將由傅筱菴委拍、而副隊長則由警務處委任、</p>
<p>警員待遇保留特權</p>
<p>協定條款之一、晚訂定「在外國人有龐大財產地區之警察署署長及經協議決定之若干署員、由「上海市府」在工部局舉荐之候補人員中派充之、」則此等警務處警員之前途、將發生問題、蓋彼等被派入特別警察隊時、當仍望保留一切權利與特權、如在警務處服務時之晉升是、而彼等在特別警察隊之薪給、亦將與在警務處時相比較也、</p>
<p>偵緝機構另行組織</p>
<p>此外、尚有其他種種問題、須待決定、迄今為止、各項計劃之討論、雖無多大進展、但警務處驚員被派入特別警察隊供職時、大致仍屬警務處人員而有完全之權利與特權、特別警察隊成立後、不久必將自設偵緝科、而與警務處及「市警局」全力合作、</p>
<p>中外見解各不相同</p>
<p>又大陸報云、本市人士、昨對工部局與「上海市府」所訂越界築咱警務協定之反響、各有不同、外籍人士雖在原則上贊成該協定、但絕不表示非常熱心、而一致以為該協定在紙面上乃向正確方面前進之步驟、但外僑同時感覺懷疑、以為最好靜待獲賭字面如何能化為行動、至於中國人士雖承認該協約或可解決本市罪行難題、惟稱「上海市府」或將解釋工部局願簽協定一事、為事實上承認偽方、是可憾耳云、</p>
<p>日人方面大為得意</p>
<p>唯有日人方面之反響、為絕對歡迎協定、稱之為歷史上的文件、並向工部局與「市府」祝賀簽訂協定、至於工部局之反響、則未可知、聞局方既認宜訂協定、當然加以贊成、但據聲稱、此後「市府」無論如何對待該協定、對於工部局毫無不利、蓋今有兩種可能性、（一）「市府」依照協定之規定而予以合作、則必有裨於公益、（二）「市府拒不遵守協定條款、則將永久證明「市府」毫無誠意、而杌隍安定之情況、應完全歸咎於「市府、」</p>

<p>繼續勸募持久平糶</p>
<p>平購委員會前規定之平糶捐款為國幣一百萬元、經各業踴躍認捐、及社會人士捐助後、巳收到之捐款總數、為五十六萬七千四百五十九元四角三分、現距離目標尚遠、該會繼續勸募、務使達到百萬元目標、使平糶得以持久、聞各業決定繼續攤認、至於收受捐款機關、仍為上海金城福源同潤等行莊、又該會巳講進之碎米總約八萬包、除第一期糶去三萬四千包外、尚餘四萬六千包、</p>
<p>米價回縮門售未跌</p>
<p>全市五百餘家米號、為恐遭受平民搶米、於前日打烊以來、昨日仍未恢復、惟門市營業、依然照常、市塲去胃呆滯、故價格復又回跌、計一號西貢東京尖跌八角、紋米各跌一元許、白元各跌一元五角左右、丹陽白尤跌二元、但米店門售、依然未縮、深望有關當局、予以嚴厲制裁、</p>
<p>浦東發生搶米風潮</p>
<p>浦東區內國米售價、雖與租界相差十餘元、但最高價額、已達四十元一石、昨日起、各米店亦一致居奇、將好米掩藏、袛在舖面出售碎米、亦須四十元一担、一般貧民、大起恐慌、七午九時、上南邊界之嚴家橋、即發生搶米風潮、時有東昌路源昌米店、赴周浦購米四十八包，歸途紅過嚴家橋、被貧民數百人、完全搶刦一光、午後南碼顯塘橋等西鎮、亦有數百貧民、搶刦米店、楊家渡鎮午後二時、擁集貧民五六百人、手執米籮麵粉袋、正圖搶米、被日軍彈壓而散、米價長此高漲不已、上海四郊、勢將引起更嚴重之風潮、</p>

<p>煤塊存底達百萬噸</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨日趨該煤業委員鮑晳薌氏、詢以關於滬市煤塊存底及抑低市價辦法、據鮑氏表示、滬市整個燃料，決無匱乏之虞、安南等地塊屑間日均有運抵、目前用途雖夥、然屯積滬東滬西各堆棧煤塊、竟達一百萬噸以上、足供滬市四百萬市民一年半之用、顧市價騰漲、顯係被人操縱壟斷所致、關於抑低市價辦法、端在大量採購、及減輕水腳、督促存貨出棧、則煤塊現貨充斥、買賣平衡、市價自落、</p>

<p>— 修荃</p>
<p>美國海軍部六大運輸艦之一「甲蒙」號，於一九二一年十一月三日，奉海軍部命，行駛於遠東與美國三藩市珍珠港海軍根據地之間，現以服務已垂十有九載，即將駛離遠東海面，返回美國故里。關於該艦與上海戰事之歷史，頗多足述之處，爰迻其梗槪如下：</p>
<p>甲蒙號於一九二零年，在美國東部之宏島（Hogisland）建造，爲美國海軍部六大運輸艦之一。艦重一萬一千噸，艦長四百四十八呎，闊五十八呎。同年，美海軍部在宏島建造同級之運輸艦六艘，其由美國駛來遠東，全程僅需十九日。另有姊妹艦兩艘：一爲「阿柯尼」號，係專載糧食軍糈者，一爲「賴德」號，係供裝運軍火飛機，坦克車大砲者。甲蒙號，於一九二一年加入遠東航行，一九二四年八月六日，完成海軍部本部之工作任務後，啣命駛茀及尼亞之儲一福克海面，旋即每年必來遠東兩决。甲蒙號會裝美海軍人員至海地，轉赴西印度羣島古巴國西部之干太，納馬灣海軍根地服務。復由該處駛往巴那馬運河，泊宿一宵，經由大西洋至太平洋，乃更折由貝爾部往桑狄哥。</p>
<p>該甲蒙號當川駐泊於桑狄哥聖保羅與舊金山之間，彼在遠東海面，包括担任太平洋之火魯奴奴，關島，馬尼刺，香港，上海，靑島與秦島之運輸事宜。甲蒙號首决到達上海，爲一九二七年，其國民革命軍方克服上海，當時甲蒙號正因尼加拉瓜地方有名山笛諾要員者，與美海軍發生衝突，在該處警戒。旋奉海軍部命，匆遽加速駛滬，增强租界防務，時爲一九二七年二月二十四日，迨三月二十一日，始行返美，再度來滬，係保護載美第四海軍聯隊司令來滬之批亞士總統輪航行。</p>
<p>美海軍二次出國，來滬塡防，仍由甲蒙號載來，時爲一九三二年二月五日，當時以「一二八」滬戰方爆發也。該艦係奉命山馬尼刺載運美海軍來滬增强租界防務者。一九三七年「八一三」滬戰全面發動，甲蒙號再度載運美海軍第六隊人員及美海軍第二隊旅長只蒙脫將軍來滬，甲蒙號於該决航行中，竟突破已往航行紀錄，於是年八月二十九日由桑狄哥滿載軍精及海軍人員啟程，以二十一日之行程，於九月十九日到達滬埠。八一三滬戰猝發後，甲蒙號曾帮助烟台，靑島，天津美僑撤退來滬，並載運若干僑胞，經日本神戶返回本國，後又駛來上海，復載美僑駛往香港。甲蒙號在美海軍部，擔任較辛勞之工作，功績遠勝各運輸艦之上。即在航行來遠東途中，該艦曾施救其他因展風而損壞之美艦。一九三六年十二月十六日，甲蒙號駛近秦皇島海面六公里時，努力帮助克利司工馬勒船援救在該處遭難之美海軍人員來滬。據悉美海軍部以其在遠東服務已屆十九年，即將召回美國桑狄哥，而代以其他美運輸艦兩艘，明年八月，即可見諸事實。至美運輸艦漢得遜號，於一月二十八日離滬，最近期內，仍將駛來上海，以資增防。</p>

<p>— I</p>
<p>本刋前為物價問題，曾有座談會之舉行；一時崇論宏議，甚為各界所注意。所惜雖有具體辦法，未能切實進行；引為憾事！最近匯價回縮，囤貨投機之風益烈，物價繼長增高；尤以米煤等生活必需品為甚。非但薪給階級發生問題；即一般已發國難財工商界，恐亦將難以為繼。此誠當前社會之嚴重問題！鄙意現在平抑物價，宜採下列各項方法，以濟眉急：</p>
<p>（一）建議中央，對採辦洋米洋煤等生活必需品者，得按重慶中交掛牌七便士之匯價，結購外匯。</p>
<p>（二）建議中央，迅令滬中銀錢業轉知各押款戶，購取米煤等生活必需品之押款。</p>
<p>（三）建議中央，迅令滬法院，隨時檢舉囤貨投機之人，依法嚴辦。</p>
<p>以上各端，不論事實上能辦到若干程度，但有些設施，亦足以儆奸商而安人心。</p>
<p>（四）由報紙公佈囤貨投機之奸商姓名，俾受與論之制裁。</p>
<p>（五）米煤等日用生活必需品，由各公團公會會同工部局，集體採辦；酌量積儲。如需款項，由銀錢業籌墊。</p>
<p>總之：物價上漲，雖為戰時應有之現象：但默察滬市物價上漲之原因，及其速度之劇烈，實受囤貨投機者之操縱；毫無疑義，是以我人一方面應酌量集體採購生活必需品；而另方面，亦應用上述各種方法，使囤貨投機之徒，知所警惕，物價當可稍稍抑平！不然，非但可連帶影響增高後方之物價，抑且足以使當地治安，發生問題；固不僅使富者益富，貧者益貧已也，閱者當不河漢斯言！（二九，二，十四）</p>

<p>四面楚歌聲　日閥政府用盡一切方法，企圖維持原料和軍需的進口。但什麼都失敗了。歐美各國當日軍侵華之初就向他聲明「非現金不獻」！日本就狂呼振興輸出；但輸出產業用原料亦須現金購入；牠的生產財（機器·原料·燃料）和生產力（勞力·動力·資力）又都被軍需工業攫佔殆盡；增產旣無從做到，出口何能增加？所以最初就傾囊送現，羅掘已盡，只好動用發行準備。日圓早成為紙幣本位。於是只好再唱振興輸出的高調。但有用呢？據他商工省的調查：他的生產指數在去年三月達到最高峯後，即開始銳降，製造工業生產指數，從去年三月份的一九一％三激减為九月份的一七三％二；鑛業生產也從一七五％二激減為一五五％。重工業從三五八％一減為三一四％二；電氣從一九三％九減為一七三％七；瓦斯從一六〇％八減為一三六％五；總指數自一八九％三減為一七一％。增產政策完全破產，輸出能力跟着破產。窮極無聊，只好加緊對華掠奪；甚至剝奪他人民的衣食所需。但去年度對第三國的貿易入超，還是高達四億六百餘萬日元。</p>
<p>現在：人荒，金荒，原料荒都已愈演愈烈；燃料荒，糧食荒的情勢尤為嚴重。而且美國在日美商約期滿失效後已準備進一步實施禁運軍火輸日的政策。跟着法日商約又將期滿失效。日本的貿易環境又豈僅對美對法已如是惡劣而已，就是對英，對印，對澳，對蘇，對德，對意，也無不陷入極端惡劣的狀態。這意義，豈僅說明他國際地位的孤立而已；更重要的，乃在指出他的經濟力已在迅速的崩潰；而給歐美各國指出「實施經濟制裁日本的時機」業已成熟。同時也是他作戰資材告竭的先聲。這裏，姑就他的貿易環境方面來做一個簡單的說明罷！</p>
<p>對美無條約狀態　去年七月，美國國會正熱烈討論着修改中立法案和夢想日法案；白宮就毅然撤毀了日美商約。這是他已有實施禁止武器輸日決心的表示，同時也用作實施這種政策的準備。美日商約已於本年一月二十六日期滿失效；兩國間已陷入無條約狀態。禁運軍火輸日案已列入議事日程；日本威脅利誘的手段決不變更美國的決心。對華貸款案已經參院通過，這是美國經濟制日與助華抗戰的又一種表現。</p>
<p>美國不僅是日本所需軍火和原料的主要來源，在歐戰勃發以來且已成為唯一的來源。同時又是日本獲取輸出外匯的最大市塲。所以日美無條約的狀態的開始，可說就是日本戰爭經濟力補給斷絕的開始。</p>
<p>法日商約期滿在即　去年三月十五日訂立的法日商約，期效不過一年；在下月十五日就要期滿失效。去年日本在法國及其屬地內經營商業，獲利很厚；出超達一百餘萬鎊；且從法國購進大量軍火物料，從突尼斯購到大批工業用鹽，從安南購進大批橡皮和煤。這些都是日本作戰上必需的物資。日方現已企圖與法國續訂，可是法國則置之不理。</p>
<p>法國不願和日本續訂商約的理由很多，在政治上，不僅因為同情中國的抗戰之故；不僅不會遺忘去年該約簽訂後，日本便在天津一帶酷瘧地推行排英反法的運動，直到現在，且在變本加厲。而且根據法日間一九〇七年的協定，雙方應互助保障法日兩方領土毘運的中國區域之和平與安全；但日本現竟完全不顧這種協定上的束縛；非特侵略海南島及其附近的中國領土，並從事於未來進攻法屬安南各地的軍事準備；現且一再對法資所造的滇越鐵路大肆轟炸。所以日法商約的期滿，正是法國實施經濟報復的機會，豈甘輕輕放過？何况在經濟立塲上說；法國供給日本的大都是法國今日對德作戰所必需的器材，而日本供給法國的，那只是些薩門魚，陶器，絲織品這類非必需品乃至奢侈品。在戰時今日的法國，正唯恐此類物品的輸入。所以更沒有對日續約的理由。</p>
<p>失常已久的英日貿易　英日棉業談判從一九三四年決裂後，英日間的貿易關係早已失常。在英國方面說：本沒有維持對日通商的必要。因為日本輸英的以罐頭食物，棉絲織品，磁器陶器等為主；這些都和英國產業衝突的。在英國對第三國的貿易中，日本所佔的地位不過百分之一至二。且呈經常的入超。可是在日本方面說；關係却就是異常重大。日本對英的輸出，約占全體輸出的二三％二；由英輸入的，約占全體輸入的二二％八。由英輸入的主要物品是苛性曹達類，燃料，皮革，獸毛，棉蔴織維等等原料。去夏日本策動反英運動後，英國就考慮對日經濟報復的手段。但英國的行動尙不脫紳士風度；他表面上雖未正式付諸實施，實際上却已停止對日貿易關係的維持。像去年的日本輸出總額內，英國的地位已降至三％七；在日本的輸入總額裏，英國的地位已降到〇·九％</p>
<p>印日會談完全破裂　印度是日本棉絲織品的主要市塲。同時是鐵，鉛等礦物和棉花，植物織維，豆類，油糟等等原料的主要供給地。日本棉織品的輸印，非特打擊英帝國的利益，而且也是危害印度新興棉紡業的成長。所以印日棉業會談，每談輒裂。去年十一月十日，印日間又開始第三次會談，一開始印度就把日方的意見堅決拒絕，接着且展開反攻的步驟。</p>
<p>日本向印方提出的要求是（一）把現行的棉布進口從價征五成的稅率减低；（二）增大日本高級棉布的輸印比額；（三）修正現行的棉花棉布交換比率制度。印度非特完全拒絕；反决定（一）決不减稅，且準備增加；（二）高級的日本棉布進口比額，不予擴大，且計劃更度縮小；（三）在不妨碍印度棉業的原則下，則不妨將過剩棉花售給日本。這樣，印日會談就完全決裂，迄今已無重開的可能。</p>
<p>澳洲對日經濟絕交　日本所需的羊毛，小麥，皮革，鉛，錫等，取給澳洲的極多。而澳洲渴南非的工業生產財則不能取償於日本。日本供給他的棉織品，罐頭食品，又正是澳洲所想自行經營的產業。所以澳洲的勞働黨始終是反日的先鋒。從中日戰事爆發後，全澳就展開非正式的對日經濟絕交。在日本南進陰謀暴露的今日，這種運動更在積極的擴大。</p>
<p>蘇聯不睬日方要求　蘇聯現雖推行着多角外交，但對日關係始終惡化，最近雖有日本蘇漁業協定，但祇是日本對蘇屈服的後果。日本為獲致這協定，只得把購買中東鐵路款項全部償還蘇聯。日蘇間的糾紛懸案何止數百件，通商問題也是其中之一。直到現在，日蘇間尙無正式商約。可是日本所需的鑛石，石油，木材，毛皮等等，正是蘇聯可以充分供給的。本年一月十日左右，日本駐蘇大使東鄉率領松島公使等到莫斯科，企圖和蘇聯的外交貿易人民委員討論這問題，但蘇聯只給他一個不睬</p>
<p>有名無實的德日商約　去年德國匆匆對日締結商約，這不過是德國外交上的一種姿態，口惠而實不至。尤其從侵略波蘭擴成歐戰，德國對外通商的路綫，已被英法海軍全盤阻斷。雖則日方想通過蘇境而和德國拉攏，但德國旣無力供應日方的軍需，而且蘇聯也決不願提供這方便之門。往常日本所需的機械百分之四十至五十取給美國；百分之二十五至三十取之德國；百分之五至二十取自英國。現在美日已入無條約狀態，英國和德國都已自顧不暇。取給海外的希望至今已完全斷絕。</p>
<p>根本敵對的日意貿易　自為國際惑星的德國，對日始終是貌合神離。前年七月中雖已訂立日「滿」意通商協定。但這根本不能使日本戰爭經濟獲得絲毫帮助。這二國都仰給於生產財的輸入，而以輕工業品作為主要的輸出。所以在絲及絲織品，人造絲和人造絲織品等，在世界市塲是處於敵對的立塲。有無相通，是增進國際通商關係的主要因素，但在意日間是根本不存在的。</p>
<p>尾語　總之：日本的商品，在世界市塲上已沒有出路；日本所需的作戰材料和原料，過去的供給門戶已在一扇扇地關閉。他的侵略政策已在自食其果。然則希望日閥悔禍是絕對不可能的事，確保中華國族獨立自由生存的祇有堅決抗戰到底；確保歐美在不權益的也祇有經濟援華與實施對日制裁。日本的貿易環境現已陷入四面楚歌中，日本的作戰經濟可說已走日暮途窮的末期了。</p>
<h3 id="c88">從美日廢除商約說到中美經濟關係 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 俞爕麟</p>
<p>美國對日之關係</p>
<p>五十年來，美國對遠東事務；關心素切，如一九二二年華盛頓會議之召集；「九一八」以後美國提倡導之史汀生主義；中日戰事爆發以來則尤甚。本年一月二十六日美日商約之廢除，可謂美國對遠東政策積極化之表示。</p>
<p>美國之所以廢除美日商約，目的當然為維持其在遠東之利益。考其過去所行之政策，為門戶開放主義。但今日之遠東情形，已非昔比。門戶開放主義，大有被日人摧殘殆盡之勢。美國處今環境，安能再取旁聽態度？廢除美日商約，故又為美國積極制日之第一步動作的演出。</p>
<p>廢除商約之原因</p>
<p>美國對日貿易，恒佔對遠東貿易總額百分之四十以上；日本以絲茶易美國之棉花鋼鐵石油等，近年來美國對日且有鉅額出超。然則美國為何要廢除美日商約？姑不談其間之種種政治問題；在經濟方面，得而述者，主要的亦有如次三端。</p>
<p>今日中國之市塲，大部已為日人攏斷；日攫取中國之豐富原料，使之不復供給美國工業之需要；同時使美國之剩餘貨品，不復在中國市塲得以插足。在戰前數年，中美兩國之貿易數量，增加之速，為他國所不及。美人自不能坐視日人如是之猖獗。</p>
<p>美日貿易，為數甚鉅，且年有增加。不過所增加者，僅軍需品而已。歐戰旣起，美國之軍需工業，不愁沒有出路。此外對日輸出最大者為棉花等，但近年减少甚多。且有盡量使用華棉以替代美棉之計劃。故日美商務之維持，事實上對美實已無利可圖。</p>
<p>美國在遠東，投有鉅額資金，經數址之經營，乃得有今日之地位。但在日人今日之廣大摧殘之下，美人所經營之事業，已大受威脅。美人又豈能忍受？</p>
<p>中美之貿易關係</p>
<p>美日商約廢除，與中國有莫大關係。中美貿易，在近年來，發展甚速。且年有出超。處於戰時之今日，對美貿易，雖已减少甚多，但仍佔重要地位。茲錄最近五年來中美貿易之總額如次：（單位千元）</p>
<p>對美出口　由美輸華</p>
<p>廿四年　一三六、四六七　一七三、七三一</p>
<p>廿五年　一八六、三二一　一八五、五二二</p>
<p>廿六年　二三一、四四九　一八八、八五九</p>
<p>廿七年　　八六、八五三　一五一、一五四</p>
<p>廿八年　一五　、六七五　一九九、六七〇</p>
<p>（註）廿八年僅一月——十月之進出口總額。</p>
<p>我國輸美之貨，以桐油，生絲，鷄蛋猪鬃等為大宗。此等皆為美國工業之主要原料。去秋歐戰發生，對美輸出激增尤烈，約能恢復戰前之狀態，或將過之。至於由美輸華之貨，以機械類與礦物由為大宗。蓋我國在此抗戰建國之中，此類貨物需用浩繁，將來更有激增希望。至於棉花，因我國內出產大都被奪，致上海之中外紗廠，不得不仰給於外棉，故美棉之輸入亦在增加。</p>
<p>美國對華之投資</p>
<p>美國對華之投資，一九三五年美國商務部曾發表估計為一萬萬三千二百萬美元。一九三八年一月十日美國國務卿赫爾發表估計為二萬萬四千萬元。其間大部為直接投資；證券投資，為數甚微。據雷莫氏估計，一九三二年時美國對華直接投資，百分之三十二為經營進出口業；百分之二十三為公共事業，包括上海之電力公司與電話公司；百分之十七為銀行及金融事業，如花旗，大通，運通等；其活動範圍，僅以各主要商埠內貿易上之金融為限；百分之十四為製造業，如香烟業，蛋品製造業及毛毯業等；百分之七為交通運輸事業；百分之六為地產業，百分之一為礦業。其三分之二集中於上海，其餘大部集中於天津。近來在航空方面，美國投資，大有發展。如汎美航空公司與中國合辦之中國航空公司。一九三六年十一月又延長太平洋橫斷航綫完成中美航空連絡綫。中日戰起，中國又將國營之招商局在沿海各口岸所有之產業，出售與美商。但大體言之：美國對華投資，以文化投資最為龐大；文化投資之總額，為英國之四倍，法國之二倍，日本之三十倍。新舊敎團及美國大財閥所營之學校醫院，遍設於全國。在華敎會之經費年達六百四十萬美元之鉅。</p>
<p>中美貨幣協定及借款關係</p>
<p>一九三四年六月起，美國大量收購白銀，於是中國之白銀源源流出，造成空前之金融恐慌。中國乃於一九三五年十一月四日實施法幣政策，集中白銀，收購國有。我國當局為穩定法幣匯價起見，中央銀行以每兩六角五分美金之價格出售與美之白銀達五千萬兩。一九三六年二月，中國向美購取黃金一千萬美元而存入美國聯邦準備銀行。並於五月十八日簽訂中美貨幣協定．於一九三七年七月又訂立中美貨幣二次協定。戰時今日，美國仍繼續購買我國之白銀。此舉對於我國法幣政策之推行有莫大之助益，故中美關係由貨幣協定而更趨接近。</p>
<p>美國對我政府之新貸款，在戰前僅有棉麥借款。在戰時又貸我二千五百萬元；據在最近報載，中美間又有新借款協定之成立云，此種舉動，實為美國增强我抗戰之有力援助。</p>
<p>美國先購我白銀，以穩定我法幣匯價；繼貸我鉅款，以增强我戰鬥實力。故中美兩國已由接近而趨於合作，共謀遠東之和平。美人深知我國勝利，則美國在遠東之利益，得以保全；否則將被逐出。故當我國處於困難之際，美人必盡力以助。</p>
<p>自美日商約廢除後，美國對遠東之一，已入新階段。日本之經濟困難，因此而愈重。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>王淸穆先生，字丹揆，崇明人，前清進士，官至廉訪，廉潔公正人皆景仰。春秋八十有一，而精神號鑠逾恒；鑒於近來滬上米價高貴，爲從來所未有，嘗諄諄勸人惜米，事關衣食住行人生四大要素之一，爰將王先生所說者，筆錄如下。</p>
<p>管子曰：五穀粒米，民之司命也。又曰：凡五穀者，萬物之主也。古之明君，賤珠玉而貴五榖，傳爲美談。今有一鈎金，人必寳而藏之，乃粒米狼戾而不知惜，何忘其所當實耶？滬上五方雜處，人烟稠密，慈善家印送善書，有附載論惜穀者，社會都不甚注意；飯館酒樓之狼藉無論已，即居戶萬千家，任意傾棄者，所在多有，向以米價賤，不知珍情，養成習慣。光緒初年，石米二千文，今貴至石米五十元，一元三千文共計一百五十千，直七十五倍矣。惜米固不論貴賤，賤時當惜，貴時更當惜，奈何不加之意，違反古人珍重粒米之說乎？宋代宰相某，招權納賄，勢傾中外，家衆千餘，口厭肥甘，廚房適鄰僧寺，每日溝中流出米飯，如玉粒珠顆，寺僧率沙彌輩，用竹筐撈起，淘凈晒乾，除僧衆食用外，積存十三囤。後某相以獲罪敗，家人四散，遺母年八十餘，流落汁京，沿街求乞，一日至寺廟山門前，僧見之，知爲某相之母，不勝嘆息，遂撥房一間居之，每頓隨衆進食，即囤中飯乾煮成者；母旋病歿，以敝蓆裏尸埋之。觀於此竊有感焉，子之賢吾，母與有責，易家人卦，婦人主中饋，某相之母，對其子則爲失敎，對中饋則爲失職，而允以不惜米榖爲破敗之主因，其結果之慘，令人酸鼻，可不引爲殷鑑乎？國人對於飲食衛生，素鮮研究，故胃病特多，食米飯忽於咀嚼，入胃後營養不足，易致停滯。陶隱君詩日：食戒欲粗並欲速，寗可少餐相接續，莫敎一飽頓充腸，損氣傷脾非是福。此飲食妙法也。學校膳堂規則，有細嚼緩嚥四字，是眞能愛學生者。大凡食一碗細嚼之飯，勝於食兩碗囫圖飯，蓋飯經細嚼，富於滋養，易於消化，故於人體有益，囫圖飯則反是，惟講求衛生者，自能辨之。居家减少飯之耗費，日積月累，節約良多，此亦情米之法也。曾文正公夫人歐陽氏，歿而成仙，世稱歐陽仙姑，嘗降壇訓婦女惜五榖，並附詩曰：世風靡靡歎而今，五穀誰存愛惜心，勸爾坤流齊警覺，莫敎孽重禍品，故特向婦女言之。國人在今日，身遭亙古未有之浩劫，宜如何洗心滌慮，上格穹蒼，惜米云者，不止省錢，亦能救劫，願我同胞在平旦時一猛省焉。</p>

<p>襪子雖然是一件小小的東西，但是我們如果不謹愼穿着的話，那一年所耗的襪子費，也是相當可觀的。</p>
<p>那末我們該怎樣保護而使它經久耐穿呢？</p>
<p>我們除購買時注意有否破綻外，最要緊的還是要我們自已留意，如果一有壞洞，我們應該立刻將其補縫，或托上一個襪底，襪尖和襪跟上要算最容易壞了，因爲這是行走時足部最用力的地方，但是只要一怠惰，那末，「小洞不補，大洞吃苦，」一個細微洞，便會逐漸蔓延到整個襪身，因此而减短了襪子的壽命。</p>
<p>有脚汗的人，所穿的襪子往往要比脚汗少的人來得多，實在因爲襪子一遇到了潮濕，當然容易壞了，我們最好做一雙布的襪套，穿在襪子的裏面，我想，這樣一來，襪子的數量一定會省得多了。</p>
<p>勤洗，那也是保護襪子最好的方法，不但襪子能經久耐穿，而且也合於衛生條件；但是許多人却以爲多洗容易洗壞，那才是錯誤的認識。不過我們在洗的時候，不要以刷子來刷，要細細的磨擦才是。</p>
<p>值此白物昂貴聲中，我們應該盡力保護所穿的襪子，使其所穿的權量减少。</p>

<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>燈節可說是農歷新年的餘興，也就是農歷新年的一個尾巴，新年以吃和娛樂爲最起勁，燈節亦復如是，諺有：「上燈圓子落燈糕，正月十五鬧允宵」之語，在昔承平的時候，元夜張燈，最爲整齊熱鬧，即所謂：「金吾不禁，城開不夜一，這種樂趣，祇可在典籍中尋覓之，在這國難嚴重的今日，當然談不到的，然而在這孤島上也許有人，還在虛應故事，來點綴良宵哩。</p>
<p>按杭俗正月十三爲上燈，十七爲落燈，至於他處，則以十二日爲上燈，十八日爲落燈，此則各地風俗之不同，燈節除賽燈外，佐以應時食品，所謂上燈圓子，（亦稱燈圓）便是用糯米磨粉後，和水製成的小圓子，如蓮子大小，入沸水煮之即熟，滲以桂花糖汁，香膩可口。憶陳栩園詞丈，會有詠燈圓句云：「畢竟女兒心手敏，胭脂和粉做燈圓」，何等美艷雋雅的佳句！上燈過後，便是元靑，（即元夜）而有一種食品，亦以元宵爲名，也用米粉製成的，其大小如胡桃，中實各種饀于，如豆沙，白糖，桃肉，瓜子仁等；惟此品以北平製的爲最著名，故市上每以北平元宵爲號召，待到落燈之日，最後以吃年糕爲止。上列各種食品，都在家庭中於按日上燈時分燒煮，先享祖先，再聚家人共同來吃，如此便結束農歷新年中的吃了。</p>

<h3 id="c99">白菜 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 張鏡人</p>
<p>白菜即菘，陸佃埤雅，謂其凌冬晚凋，上時常見有菘之操，故名曰菘。李自珍謂有二種，一爲圓莖，微靑而厚，一爲白莖，質薄而扁，即今庖廚中所習見者也。而黃芽菜者，亦即白菜之變種，特以產地不同，種法有別，土質殊異，故其性味亦因之而殊異。至其功用，具群本草，性溫味甘，無毒，通利腸胃，解除煩悶，和中下氣，消食解酒，治瘴氣，止熱嗽，冬汗尤佳，則以經霜之後，性轉凉而味益甘也。故用生菜搗爛，能治瘡毒，以汁注目，能出飛絲，西藥用以製膏爲平火安心之劑，謂其功用可代鴉片，並能發表，利小便，取輕瀉，興海葱毛地黃同服，能治臌症，其子榨油，能長頭髮，塗刀劍不銹，故凡軍需所用之擦槍油，即生菜油也。惟日華諸家本草，謂其性凉微毒，多食發皮膚風瘙痒，然今之人用爲普通食品，未嘗有此弊，大抵日華所指，乃變種之黃芽菜耳；因其種於沙土，固與粘土之性質有不同也。李時珍云：黃芽菜係北方人以馬糞壅培，蓋仿韭黃之法，然則古人所謂春初早韭，秋末晚菘，均爲變種栽培之訣，非指一般之常物而言也。馬糞含銷，其性獨能上升透發，與舶來品之肥田粉中銷酸阿母尼亞之性質相同，故能助長莖葉，充分肥大，日華子所謂能發皮膚風者，由此引微，即其理所當然，故我以爲忌發食者，是黃芽菜，非白菜耳。若論補養，則以含淡素之蛋白質較多者爲貴，淡素即硝素，而阿母尼亞亦即硝素與水素搆成，是又白菜不如黃芽菜之强有力也。面黃肌瘦之人，因缺乏含淡素之食物所致，故稱人爲面有菜色。南方人之弱，不如北方之强，雖貧民亦可以面部之肉色爲辨，殆即因其所食之菜有不同歟？菜油與豆油之滋養力，亦可知其選別，主中饋者，不可不三致意焉。</p>
<h3 id="c100">衣服與妻子的連繫 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 荊樹森</p>
<p>誰都知道，衣服是人人要着的，一不能離身；妻子呢？也是人人要有的，「不孝有三，無後爲大。」可是，這，根本是兩件事，風馬牛不相關。</p>
<p>但是，古來的人們，往往喜歡把這兩件事，相提並論，好像是它們有着連繫的關係似的。當然，關於這，要是認眞的考證起來，一定有很多的例子，在這裏，只舉幾個最通俗而又很流行的來證明證明。</p>
<p>讀過三國志的人，大概總記得劉先生會經這樣說過：「妻子如衣服，兄弟如手足。」喻妙天下，倒比得很有意思。可惜他下面那兩句：「衣服破，猶可補；手足斷，不可續。」雖然是他的義薄雲霄之語，未免太輕視了做妻子的呢？</p>
<p>上面這一段，不過是一個比喻而已，並沒有直接的發生什麼連繫的關係。像平劇中的武家坡一齣裏，王寳釧和伊的丈夫薛平貴的對口唱詞中有：「我問他，……衣服破了？」伊除了打聽丈夫的飲食起居之外，還担心着丈夫的衣服，這就很明白地吿訴了人們：這是做妻子的對於丈夫應該關心的分內事情。</p>
<p>其實，每個男子的討老婆，他的宗旨，並不是專門爲了衣服的問題；但是有好多人總是拿著衣服的大問題來做幌子，薪此掩誕他難於啟齒的羞恥，旣冠冕，又堂皇，眞可算極盡說話的技巧。</p>
<p>不信，你隨便走到那一條馬路，或者是那一處街頭巷尾，總會使你聽到一種如泣如訴的歌聲：「王老五呀王老五，……白白活了三十五，衣裳破了沒人補！……。」這一支歌曲，本來是王老五訴說他目己內心的苦悶。有人說：「沒討家小，就爽爽快快的說沒討家小，爲什麼要轉灣抹角的說是衣服破了沒人補呢？何况，關於妻子的問題多得很，爲什麼偏要說到衣服呢？」這不知何所根據？作者不敏，有待高明之士的指敎！</p>
<p>末了，作者倒記起段有趣而又滑稽的故事來了，這還是在童年時代所聽到的；現在把它寫在這裏，旣可供讀者諸君的笑，也可作爲本文的結束。據說：從前有一個貧士的兒子，年近而立，還沒有娶妻，頗不滿意他的父親。有一天，他異想天開的在他父親每日必經的地方，題上兩句五言，詩道：「年已二十五，衣破無人補。」果然，第二天發生了反應，是：「若要補衣人，再過二十五！「險些兒沒把他的肚皮氣炸了。立刻提起筆來，又是兩句七言，道：「人生七十古來稀，那個五十方娶妻？」理直氣壯，這一駁，滿以爲準可得到最後的勝利，那裏料到他的父親抱定宗旨，輕描淡寫的答復他兩句道：「太公八十遇文王，再等幾年父何妨！」</p>

<h3 id="c101">一個小廟祝來函 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 李星如</p>
<p>上海淪爲「孤島」以後，據說廟宇寺觀也同樣呈現着「繁榮」現象。在生活被壓得喘不過氣的時候，去求仙問卜，已是憑笨之至，何况你反去養活一批社會的蠶蟲。下面是一個小廟祝寫來的信，想請菩薩來解决自己命運的憑夫愚婦們，請破費一點功夫，讀完這段文字罷。（編者）</p>
<p>（一）工作　每日的工作，時聞自晨六時至晚十時，方可休息，共十四小時之工作，如有道塲功德等事，通宵工作，亦習而爲常。工作範圍，舉凡廟中一切事務，不停手的工作外，還須侍奉主持一切私事，身兼數職，甚於奴婢。</p>
<p>（二）待遇　廟祝供膳宿外，每月薪金，自一元至四五元不等，如有齋醮道塲，可獲些微客人意外的賞賜。但賞賜超過法幣一元者，則須交給主持，由主持給回三四角錢，餘則飽其私囊。</p>
<p>（三）膳食　主持雖是出家人，惟他却是修心不修口的，每日佐餐非鷄肉魚類，不能下咽，但手下人等必須持素，不准吃　。主持每日除白米飯外，還須有一頓黑米飯——烟癖，這樣的出家人眞是可嘆！</p>
<p>（四）勢利　此外兼具有一付勢利的眼光，如見有富紳大居士駕臨，則逢迎備至，招待殷勤，如遇平常燒香之客，則由道士招呼，如獲益不多，則更斤計較，討價還價，眞乃勢利的小人。</p>
<p>（五）歛財　歛財的手段，極爲高明而且無微不至，借共房間作功德，動輒數十金。如僱用道士，代念咒語，客人出代價四元，而道士僅得三角八分。此外蠟燭油，亦爲獲利之最大者，如有客人燒香，勸其購買大蠟燭，一俟客人出門，立將蠟燭拔下，蠟燭油每擔市價可賣八十元至一百元。並有各種歛錢方法，手段高明，眞是不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>以上所述種種，俱爲事實，爲親自目睹及經手者，這種出家人，旣無益於國家，徒貽害於社食，今僅將內中黑幕，一一揭破，希慈心誠意的善男信女，將有用的錢財，多作救濟難民之用，勿再作此愚舉。</p>
<h3 id="c102">又一慈善醫院 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 未成</p>
<p>見到本月一日本刊所載若夢君之「美國難民醫院」一文以後，使我心中也不期然地想起了另一個專爲貧病造福的醫院</p>
<p>這醫院位在法租界望志路近呂班路口的一洋房內，門前並無名稱牌號。據筆者所知，聞係一德國「童生姑娘」所辦，諒屬敎會中人，專行慈善事業者，故人通稱之日「童生醫院」。該院有二診所，一專治男子，另一則專治婦女。院中有德籍醫師及華籍助手十餘位，皆屬女性。在這裏除醫藥費不收外，即揖號費亦分文不取。該院亦內外科均有，並備有病房</p>
<p>「美國難民醫院」在滬西，也許有些人認爲路遠不便的話，那麼不妨到那兒去，不過請注意：她們臨診的時間，祇在上午，下午即閉門，免得碰釘子。</p>
<h3 id="c103">學校「出入證」不應收費 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 季甫芳</p>
<p>我們時常在報上看到拐匪混入小學校，剝取學童衣服，或是唆騙幼孩，設法拐帶。爲了子弟的安全計，多數家長，不顧麻煩，都入校接送，或親自前去，或派傭人前去</p>
<p>小學校的校舍是很狹小的，自然容納不下這些「閒人」，但是又不能阻止家長們接送學生。並且仍有不相干的人出入，所以近來有很多學校，都發「出入證」以限制</p>
<p>所謂「出入證」，乃是一張紙脾子，凡要領取者，須繳洋五角一元不等，少數學校說日後發還的，多數却沒有發還。</p>
<p>在學費書費的漲價聲中，學校當局似乎不應該在「出入證」上收費，如果在必要時，僅能收證的成本代價，無論發還與吾，都是增加家長們的負擔，這是學校當局該注意的。</p>
<p>「出入證」是很好的辦法，可是「凡事要錢」，未免太「商店化」了！</p>
<h3 id="c104">輿論製裁！ <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>最近物價的飛漲確是太驚人了，尤其是米，麵和煤球三項。不要說每天拿幾角錢零買的貧民活不下去，便是一班靠些微的俸給生活者也莫不叫苦述天。什麼都可以節約，只飯麵不能不吃，媒爐不能不燒。報載市聯會函請市商會火速設法平定物價，那確是當務之念　筆者想假使由市商會和工部局聯合來組織一個物價平衡會，調節物價，那收效一定會非常之宏大的。</p>
<p>考最近米麵和煤球的飛漲，「來源不暢」與「水脚突增」果然不可一筆抹煞，但最主要的原因，還是由於泯沒天良的投機商的蠢動，這是可以從幾家煤球廠催吿出貨的廣吿上看出來的。因此，筆者以爲除由市商會和工部局聯合組織物價平衡會外，我們還得發動「輿論制裁」，以補救平衡會的不足。</p>
<p>所謂「與論制裁」，就筆者所想到的有下列兩種，特別要籲請各報編者給予同情和贊助：</p>
<p>（一）各報儘量刋載揭發投機商的陰謀的稿件。</p>
<p>（二）各報編者（尤其是副刋）儘力領導輿論制裁，以身作則，多作抨擊或揭發投機商的稿件。</p>

<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>葉誦芬道：『我不信！難道這送報人，眞像江鏡蓉面孔。我明天自己去瞧瞧，看了就明白了。』老張媽道：『少爺！你明天起來得早些，讓我把他攔住了，你便出來看他。要是不先把他攔住，他跑得飛快，你再也追不着他。今天也是差一點被他跑去了，幸虧我追得快，被我抓住了。』葉誦芬一聽，愈加疑心是江鏡蓉了，記得在學校甲賽跑的時候他就跑得比我快。到了明天，葉誦芬果然起了一個早，要去看那隔壁的送報人。關照老張媽，來了就喊他。及至江鏡蓉到了每天那個老時辰送報來時，老張媽一面喊她的小主人，一面便向江鏡蓉道：『小送報的！慢慢交！我們少爺要給你講句話咧，你且等一等；』江鏡蓉一聽得此話，什麼他家少爺要給我講話，他家的少爺，不就是葉誦芬嗎？便拔脚飛跑。可是葉誦芬已經追出來了，這時葉誦芬比他跑得快，爲什麼呢？原來葉誦芬是空手，而他却手中還挾着一大捆報紙。葉誦芬兜到他面前一看，不是江鏡蓉是誰呢？便道：「江鏡蓉！你今天被我捉住了！我寫了好幾封信給你，你老不答復我，這是什麼緣故？我原猜着你沒有進學校了，但你爲什麼賣起報來了呢？」江鏡蓉却是面漲通紅，低頭不語。葉誦芬道：「我們是好朋友你爲什麼不吿訴我。你倘然無力升學，我可以帮助你，我和父親說了，你那點學費，他一定肯擔任。即使父親不肯擔任，我也還有一些兒儲蓄金，有個摺子存在銀行，我也能帮你的忙。我們在敎科書上，不是讀過什麼「朋友有通財之義」的這句話嗎？你今天下午五點鐘，到我家裏來，我們商量辦法，你說好不好呢？商量好了，你就不必再賣報了。」江鏡蓉搖了一搖頭道：『不！你還是讓我賣報的好。不是我不想讀書，不想升學。但是否媽生我三人，我有兩個妹妹，你是知道的。因爲我讀了書，兩位妹妹迫得不能讀書了。現在我不讀書，我的大妹妹已經進了小學校了。因此我心中很爲高興，我預備讓小妹妹，也進了學校。我賣報，是帮助着吾媽，吾媽爲着我們兒女，實在太辛苦了。』說着，不禁掉下淚來。（二三九）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Significant Progress of Chinese Forces in Southern Guangxi: Fierce Fighting in the Santang Area; Japanese Troops North of Sitang Completely Cleared; Remnants of Japanese Troops in Nanning Engaged in Mutual Killing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Binyang: The defeated Japanese forces from Binyang and Yongning retreated freely to Shanglin and Binyang. Pursued by Chinese forces to Sitang and Wutang on the Yongbin Road, they were dealt a severe blow. The remnants retreated to Santang, attempting to resist stubbornly. Since the evening of the 17th, Chinese forces have been pursuing and annihilating them courageously and fiercely, and are currently engaged in intense fighting near Santang. Japanese troops who retreated on the Yongwu Road were relentlessly pursued and surrounded by Chinese forces, unable to escape. Fierce fighting is currently taking place south of Dagao Peak, with the Chinese forces in high morale, poised to annihilate these remnants of the Japanese forces. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Chinese forces advancing on the Yongbin Road have been pursuing relentlessly for days, making rapid progress. No trace of the Japanese remains north of Sitang. On the 17th, the Chinese launched a fierce attack on Santang, where the Japanese resisted stubbornly from their fortifications. Annihilation is currently underway. Japanese troops at Dagao Peak, lacking support, have been completely surrounded by Chinese forces and are being annihilated. Nanning is in extreme chaos, with the Japanese setting fires and engaging in mutual killing for days. Many Japanese soldiers have died. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Japanese forces in southern Guangxi, determined to invade north, gathered reinforcements from various locations in large numbers. After being dealt a severe blow by Chinese forces, the Japanese suffered another crushing defeat. Japanese command became disorganized, leading to a frantic and chaotic retreat, impossible to control. On the 15th and 16th, Japanese troops in Nanning went to Qinxian, each demanding to be the first to flee into Guangxi, arguing fiercely and refusing to yield to each other. When they gathered in Nanning, a great confusion suddenly erupted, and they are currently engaged in fierce infighting, killing each other. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chinese Frontline Generals Discuss Reasons for Victory</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Japanese Southern China Army Headquarters issued a notice to the Chinese generals on the Guangxi-Guizhou frontline the day before yesterday, citing lack of funds. According to a dispatch from a reporter on the Guangxi-Guizhou frontline, the reporter (referring to himself) visited the frontline generals to inquire about their opinions. According to what was discussed, on the one hand, the Japanese praised the Chinese army's bravery in combat, and on the other hand, criticized the Chinese army's clumsy tactics, even suggesting they were easily defeated, and it is not known what they were aiming at. As for the victories, defeats, casualties, and deaths in past battles, there is factual evidence, and we need not say more. But the tactics that the Japanese considered clumsy were actually used in various battles, whether in northern Hubei, southern Shanxi, northern Hunan, or northern Guangdong. The Japanese army invariably suffered fatal blows from the Chinese army, all resulting from these clumsy tactics. It is not only that it was used in this battle for southern Guangxi. The Chinese army will definitely use these clumsy tactics even more in the future to control the fate of the Japanese. It must be known that our country's ancient tactics all have the established rule of using clumsiness to overcome skill; it is not comparable to the boastful and self-aggrandizing Japanese army, which specializes in creating rumors and using clever words to deceive the world. The Chinese army's tactics will not change because of the pain felt by the Japanese army and their praise or criticism. In other words, the deeper the Japanese army intrudes, the wider the scope, and the longer the time, the greater, more numerous, and faster the opportunity for the Chinese to annihilate the Japanese army will be. This time in southern Guangxi has been a great battlefield, but unfortunately the Japanese army did not dare to take another step deeper, and their retreat was unusually fast. Wherever they went, they dared not stay for a moment, so that the Chinese army could only intercept most of them, but failed to completely net them all and achieve the goal of annihilating the Japanese army. This is the only regret of the Chinese army. The Japanese army's disregard for their reputation and preoccupation with saving their lives is also rare in ancient and modern war history. Moreover, the Japanese army has already occupied Chinese territory such as Wuming, Binyang, and Shanglin, and has also claimed that the Chinese army's strength has been completely eliminated. If that is the case, may I ask what the results of this battle are? And where exactly are the spoils? Furthermore, who made their army retreat in such a hurried manner, not daring to look back even for a moment? The Japanese army also claims that if the Chinese army is really strong, why not attack the strongholds they occupy? May I ask whether Kunlun Pass, which the Chinese army captured this time, is the most important stronghold, and whether the Japanese army defending Kunlun Pass is its most elite Fifth Division, and whether the terrain of Kunlun Pass is perilous? Even with the Japanese defending this stronghold, it was not difficult for the Chinese army to capture it, so is it not possible to capture other strongholds? However, the Chinese army's strategy is not to capture a certain stronghold, but to focus on besieging the Japanese army. The Japanese army should always be aware of this point. We hope that in the future, the Japanese army can indeed firmly defend the cities and towns it occupies and dare to penetrate deep into our interior in order to achieve its ambition to invade all of China. Only then will it not disgrace the prestige of what it calls the "Imperial Army." Otherwise, if it continues to behave like cowardly thieves, advancing and retreating with difficulty, and completely exposing its impoverished state, not only will it lose its military reputation, but even if it is not annihilated by the Chinese army, it will definitely be exhausted by the Chinese army, causing its officers and soldiers to die in vain. And if it treats the lives of its officers and soldiers as child's play, then it will definitely have a day, as our Supreme Commander said, when it will "be defeated without fighting," "not one will return alive," and "die in battle or be trapped to death," and that day is not far off. However, during the meeting of the Japanese Parliament, the Japanese army had no choice but to fabricate battle results, which the Chinese army also knows very well and deeply understands. As for advising the Chinese army to abandon its offensive and pursue peace, the Japanese army should reflect on itself. We can clearly tell the Japanese army that until all the Japanese troops invading Chinese territory are annihilated or driven out of our country's borders, we dare to tell the Japanese army not to dream of seeking peace again. Our country's soldiers and civilians are fighting for the life of the nation and national independence, and their war aims are extremely sacred, and we accept the Japanese army's praise and will work hard to do so, and will continue to pursue the enemy bravely and relentlessly until the goal is achieved. In this fierce battle in southern Guangxi, the number of officers and soldiers of the Japanese Nakamura Brigade who were killed or wounded, and the number of corpses abandoned on the battlefield, are rare in previous battles. The Chinese army solemnly buried the remains of the Japanese soldiers who died in battle, so as not to expose them. The number of them, the Japanese army knows it in its heart, so we need not add to the statistics. However, the war spoils captured by the Chinese army, according to the investigation so far, only in terms of light and heavy machine guns, there are already three hundred and thirty-six, field guns and mountain guns twenty-two, and twenty-seven other gun carriages, nineteen wireless radios, gas masks, rifles and carbines, and artillery shells, machine gun bullets, and tank defense shells, etc., have been packed into more than one thousand six hundred boxes, and it has been decided to transport them to a suitable location within a few days for a public exhibition, so that Chinese and foreign people can understand the extent of the price paid by the Japanese army for this invasion of southern Guangxi. As for the Japanese officers and soldiers captured by the Chinese army, they are all treated kindly, and everyone is mentally at ease and physically healthy. The Japanese military and civilians need not worry about them. However, there may be a day when these people return to their country and settle accounts with the Japanese warlords.

<p>Lanzhou: The Chinese forces in western Sui have been pursuing the Japanese troops retreating to Wuyuan for days, capturing and killing many. The day before yesterday, a remnant of the Japanese army reached Jianzhu, attempting to cross the Tongxingtang River stealthily, but was caught up and fiercely attacked by the Chinese forces. The Japanese were in extreme chaos, with many drowned and killed. The river water was completely red. Only a small number of remnants fled eastward, and the Chinese are still closely following them, determined to annihilate them all. (18th dispatch)</p>

Dozens of speedboats loaded with more than a thousand Japanese troops forcibly landed at Baitang and Qingyang. Chinese garrison forces blocked and attacked on multiple routes. Fierce fighting continued until late in the evening. It is reported that Haicheng County is located south of the isolated island of Xiamen, and the Japanese army has not dared to invade it for two years. Today, they are using the defeated and remnant Japanese troops from Zhao'an and Dongshan to harass, but they are merely trying to get lucky. The Chinese army is determined to annihilate them on the spot and give them a fundamental blow. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>On the Qiantang River front in eastern Zhejiang, the Chinese army continued to attack on the morning of the 17th. A part of the army is besieging Hangwu Mountain, and it will not be difficult to annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. The Japanese army surrounded northwest of Laoheshangtou retreated to the vicinity of Jinjiadian, south bank of the Fuchun River, because of excessive casualties, and attempted to resist. At the same time, a small group of Japanese troops broke out of the encirclement, lost their way, made a mistake in direction, and collapsed southward to the vicinity of the Daqiao Bridge west of ×shan City, and had already fallen into the Chinese army's encirclement, which is being intensified. Looking at the overall situation in eastern Zhejiang, the Chinese army is indeed confident of victory. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week (February 10th to 16th), the Chinese army on all fronts has continued to make great efforts and has repeatedly achieved great victories. The important aspects of the battle are described below:</p>
<p>Southern Guangxi: Since the Chinese army recovered Yongchun, Shibujie, Gantang, Gula, and Litang last week, killing tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers, it took advantage of the victory to advance in multiple directions this week. After Gula and Gantang, it successively captured the traffic strongholds of Nahe, Daqiao, and Luxu on the right wing line of the Japanese army, and its winding basic route was urgently cut into several sections, and its roundabout formation was destroyed. As for the main force of the Japanese army that invaded Wuming, after an all-night attack by the Chinese army, it was completely intercepted by the Chinese north of Shuangqiao. The Chinese army controlled Shuangqiao, beginning a heavy encirclement and cutting off its retreat. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese army collapsed completely. The Chinese army, with the momentum of a broken bamboo, intercepted and killed in multiple directions, immediately recovering Binyang and taking advantage of the victory to advance towards Wutang and Sitang. The remnants of the enemy simultaneously collapsed and retreated, and Nanning fell into a state of chaos. In total, the Japanese army in southern Guangxi suffered casualties of more than 30,000, and the war spoils captured were even more numerous, and are being cleared.</p>
<p>Western Sui: The Japanese army in Baotou committed crimes in western Sui in separate directions, and was intercepted and attacked by the Chinese along the way, with thousands of casualties. Until dawn on the 9th, it was drawn into an encirclement by the Chinese army. After a day of fierce fighting, countless enemies were annihilated. From the 11th, bloody battles continued to unfold. The Chinese army advanced towards Linhe and Wuyuan in separate directions, successively capturing important strongholds such as Taihe. Until the 12th, the remaining Japanese troops in the vicinity of Linhe had been completely wiped out. The Japanese army then reinforced again, and was intercepted by the Chinese army. The area east of the Wuyuan Highway is now completely controlled by the Chinese, and Chinese armies in various places are also launching simultaneous attacks on the flanks and rear of the Japanese army. The remnants of the enemy are trapped in the Chinese encirclement, with no way to advance or retreat, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province: The Japanese troops in Xiaoshan suffered extremely heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the Chinese army. On the 14th and 15th, the Japanese secretly crossed the south bank of the Qiantang River from the north bank in two directions, landing at Baima Mountain east of Xiaoshan City. On the way, Chinese artillery bombarded and sank 25 Japanese warships. Then, after landing at Sanyilu, more than 500 Japanese soldiers invaded Changshan Town, but they were met head-on by the Chinese army. After several close-quarters battles, the original position was recovered. More than 1,000 Japanese troops who landed on Baima Mountain invaded from the south of Jingjiangdian, and were repulsed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated and are currently engaged in a bloody battle north of Anchang Town.</p>
<p>Fujian Province: The Japanese army that fled to Jianshan Island suffered extremely heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the Chinese garrison. On the evening of the 14th, the Chinese army recovered Xipu in one fell swoop, capturing many. The remnants of the enemy collapsed and retreated in succession, and the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them. By the morning of the 15th, they had recovered strongholds such as Wuliting. Another part of the Chinese army recovered Baicheng. At 2 p.m. on the 16th, the Chinese army recovered Dongshan County. The remnants of the enemy were surrounded by the Chinese army near the port. After a week's night of annihilation, most of them were annihilated, and a small number of the remaining Japanese troops returned to their ships and fled. There is no trace of the Japanese on the island.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in the Tongcheng area of southern Hubei invaded the vicinity of Jingmen on the 10th, but they were met by the Chinese army, and many Japanese corpses were left behind. On the 11th, another Chinese unit launched a fierce surprise attack on the side of the Japanese army from a certain location, engaging in a pincer attack for three hours. The Japanese abandoned more than 400 corpses and collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army in Hubei once again defeated the Japanese who invaded the Da× Mountain, and annihilated more than half of the Japanese troops in the Luoyangdian area. On the 10th, the Japanese heavily reinforced the Maping area of Jingshan, but the Chinese army met them head-on and fought bloody battles for several days. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated, and the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, successively capturing strongholds such as Wangjiahai, annihilating more than two thousand.</p>
<p>Shanxi Province: The 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese troops in Xiaxian County are currently being heavily besieged and annihilated by the Chinese army. Another part of the Chinese army in central Shanxi reached the suburbs of Taiyuan City on the 2nd, stormed into the Japanese airfield, burned and destroyed many Japanese aircraft, and captured a great deal. In addition, there have been fierce battles in Daming and Yushan in southern Hebei, Ningjin, Zunhua in eastern Hebei, Dexian in northern Shandong, and Changle in eastern Shandong, and many Japanese have been killed. The Japanese traffic on the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Jiaoji lines has been cut off from time to time, and the Japanese feel a great threat. This is also an important war record from the past week.

<h3 id="e13">The Dalai Lama's Enthronement and the Future of Tibet <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>After the passing away of the 13th Dalai Lama, leader of Tibetan politics and religion, in the 22nd year, the Tibetan authorities searched extensively for his reincarnation. Last summer, a six-year-old child, Lamu Denzhu, was found at Hongtu Cliff in Qinghai and confirmed as the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. He was escorted back to Tibet, and his enthronement ceremony is scheduled to be held in Lhasa on the 22nd of this month. The National Government attaches great importance to this event. Last autumn, Wu Zhongxin was appointed to enter Tibet to preside over the Dalai Lama's reincarnation affairs. He has now arrived in Lhasa and received a warm and grand welcome from the Tibetan monks and laypeople. Recently, the government even issued an order specially approving Lamu Denzhu to succeed as the 14th Dalai Lama and allocated 400,000 yuan for the enthronement ceremony expenses. All these measures are unprecedented since Tibet became estranged from the motherland. The central government's concern for the borderlands and the Tibetan people's loyalty to the motherland can be seen from these facts. Reports say that all sectors of Chongqing are preparing to hold a grand celebration on the day of the enthronement ceremony, which shows that although the enthronement of this Dalai Lama is a succession of religious position in Tibet, its significance is by no means trivial.</p>
<p>The late 13th Dalai Lama, Agvan Lobsang Thupten Gyatso, was indeed a capable and promising enlightened ruler, but his personal experiences coincided with the most unfortunate era in the history of Tibet. On one side was the foolish and autocratic Manchu Qing, and on the other was foreign aggression waiting for an opportunity to invade. It was to be expected that a primitive nation with backward production and the separation of politics and religion would not be able to cope with ease. Therefore, in the past, the separation of Sino-Tibetan relations and the Dalai Lama's constant exposure to the brunt could not be completely blamed on him alone. Tibet broke away from China and became independent in the early years of the Republic. The Shimla Conference, convened by China, Britain, and Tibet in the third year of the Republic to resolve the Tibetan issue, ended in failure due to unresolved opinions. In the nearly thirty years since then, Sino-Tibetan relations have been precarious. It is said that the late Dalai Lama also had a heart of repentance and inward reflection in his later years, but he died in depression because the situation in Tibet was deeply rooted and difficult to reverse. Fortunately, the Dalai Lama's reincarnation has been found, and the political situation in Tibet will return to stability. China has also greatly increased its prestige due to its resolute war of resistance, and its international status has also improved. The border people's inclination towards the interior is also becoming more and more eager, so that Sino-Tibetan relations can be restored from estrangement to intimacy, opening a new era in the past 30 years. This is naturally something that the people of China and Tibet should feel happy about.</p>
<p>In the past, the separation of Tibet from China was generally considered to be the fault of British inducement, but that was only one side of the issue. At the end of the 19th century, British policy toward Tibet had a more aggressive phase. When British troops invaded Tibet twice in 1888 and 1903, the Tibetans resisted extremely fiercely and had no goodwill towards the British. The reason why they turned from enemies to friends and turned to the British for help was entirely due to the improper response of the Qing court. When the Manchu Qing Dynasty was at its peak, its policy of governing the border regions was nothing more than the alternate use of military suppression and preferential treatment. The border people were afraid of the strength of the military force, and the leaders were confused by the preferential treatment, so they were able to live in peace. By the late period, the prestige of the Qing court had declined, but its arrogance and self-importance had increased. In addition, most of the garrison officials were corrupt and foolish people who only sought profit for themselves and were indifferent to the suffering of the border people. As a result, the vassal states carried out dissent due to resentment. When the authorities promoted the New Policies in the border provinces, they sought to extort them severely, disregarding the customs and feelings of the border people, which gave the agitators an opportunity to exploit. The separation of Outer Mongolia and Tibet from China was the main reason for this. Lao Bin said that what they wanted to betray was the Qing court, and they did not necessarily have any antipathy towards China. Looking at the situation in Tibet alone, when the Tibetan monks and people were brutally invaded by foreign enemies, the Qing officials simply succumbed to the outside world and stood by and watched. They were unable to treat the Dalai Lama, who was loved by the Tibetan monks and people, with preferential treatment and help him return to Tibet during his exile, but instead added insult to injury and repeatedly threatened him with the revocation of his titles, causing him to seek foreign assistance in desperation. When Zhao Erfeng led troops into Tibet, he suppressed the rebellion by force, destroyed temples, and slaughtered monks and people, which aroused the public anger of the Tibetan people even more, and the situation in Tibet became unmanageable. Looking back on the above process, it can be seen that even if there was external incitement in the past Tibetan problem, the main reason was still the Qing court's poor handling of the borderlands. All of this is good as a lesson for the future.</p>
<p>During the reorganization of the Kuomintang in the thirteenth year, it made generous and broad promises to the ethnic minorities in the country. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it also made various plans for border administration, but none of them achieved significant results. The entry of Sino-Tibetan relations into a new stage is mainly after the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, which is also a major gain for China in the process of the war of resistance. In recent years, Tibetan monks and laypeople have frequently entered and exited the front lines and the rear, jointly undertaking publicity and comfort work with the people of the interior. The major monasteries in Tibet have also been constantly engaged in prayers to wish for the early realization of the victory of the war of resistance. It is expected that after the enthronement of the 14th Dalai Lama, the relationship between the two sides will become closer. At present, the central government's basic principles regarding the handling of border issues have already been established, and what is needed is how to implement correct and firm concrete policies, and to never repeat the mistakes of the past. On the other hand, the people of the border provinces should also first understand that seeking survival through the war of resistance is the only urgent issue for China. Unless the war of resistance is won, all local interests cannot be maintained, and only by intensifying unity and striving for the war of resistance can they achieve their own liberation from the liberation of the Chinese nation. The holding of this enthronement ceremony of the Dalai Lama has created a psychological foundation of cooperation and mutual assistance between the Tibetan and Chinese ethnic groups, which should be further promoted and developed in the future so that Tibet, which is in the process of modernization, and other border ethnic groups can strive to contribute to the motherland.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Sixth Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Chairman Chiang Urges the National Populace to Examine Themselves, Discover Shortcomings, Immediately Correct Them, Vigorously Implement Wartime Living, and Strive for Wartime Service <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Chairman Chiang, on the 18th, for the sixth anniversary of the New Life Movement, especially exhorted compatriots nationwide, saying, "Today is the sixth anniversary of the New Life Movement. Our War of Resistance has entered its fourth year, which is also the final critical juncture for our survival. Recalling six years ago, the purpose of my promoting the New Life Movement was to make everyone aware of the national crisis, restore inherent morality, and implement wartime living to wash away the common shame of our compatriots and seek the glory of our national independence. Now, our War of Resistance has lasted thirty-two months. Because of the sacrifice and efforts of our soldiers and all our compatriots, we have not only laid the foundation for final victory in military affairs, but also become stronger as we fight. However, today, more than a million Japanese soldiers are still in our country, trampling on our rivers and mountains and harming our compatriots. The difficulty and immensity of our national responsibilities are of course increasing day by day. Therefore, we must work harder than ever before to achieve the great historical mission of resisting aggression and building the country. When we commemorate the New Life Movement today, we must all have a profound reflection on the past and strive forward along a practical path for the future. When I broadcast on the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement last year, I said that the twenty-eighth year [of the Republic] should be a year of progress for the New Life Movement, requiring everyone to improve their wartime living and enhance their strength in resisting aggression to create a new life for our nation. At the same time, I further explained the meaning of the New Life Movement's basic principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. I said (propriety must advance to strict discipline, righteousness must advance to generous sacrifice, integrity must advance to practical thrift, and shame must advance to earth-shattering struggle). Now, a year has quickly passed. To review the achievements of the New Life Movement, we must ask whether the spirit and life of our people have progressed compared to before, and whether our compatriots have thoroughly implemented wartime living. I can frankly say that our people, especially those with public service responsibilities, have not fulfilled their responsibilities as wartime citizens. Generally speaking, our lives are not austere enough, our spirits are not tense enough, our actions are not orderly and serious enough, and the efficiency of our work has not been truly practical and rapid. Although our compatriots generally have enthusiastic sentiments of resisting aggression, they are not compatible with the arduous wartime life in practical life, nor are they in line with the requirements of the country. Apart from a very few, how many of our families, societies, schools, and groups can avoid the habits of extravagance, depravity, carelessness, and procrastination? If this shortcoming cannot be reformed, we are truly letting down the soldiers who are struggling hard at the front and the martyred compatriots who have sacrificed their lives. I believe that this is the greatest shame of our country, and it also means that the New Life Movement has not achieved practical results. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the sixth anniversary of the New Life Movement, I want to especially bring it up to draw the attention of our compatriots. The New Life Movement is not any special movement, it completely focuses on the improvement of individual life and the practice of national morality. At the same time, the main purpose of the New Life Movement is to transform society and change customs. Therefore, our compatriots must not only be self-aware, but also awaken others; not only encourage themselves, but also encourage others. The New Life Movement has been advocated for six full years. All the theories and outlines do not need to be further elaborated today. I will simply remind everyone to check whether their own lives are suitable for the New Life Movement and the wartime life I have described. Regardless of the smallest details, they must reflect at any time. If they find shortcomings, they must immediately correct them. At the same time, I hope that they will identify several specific matters, persuade society, encourage compatriots, and actively promote them to ensure that our own selves, our families, and the society we come into contact with do not violate the requirements of wartime in a passive way, and actively strengthen the strength of resisting aggression and building the country. Simply put, we want our compatriots to vigorously implement wartime living on the one hand and strive for wartime service on the other hand. Based on the above-mentioned purpose, our New Life Movement General Association has decided on five key points as the main work for the seventh year of the New Life Movement: 1) Vigorously implement spiritual mobilization and promote wartime living. The National Spiritual Mobilization has been popular throughout the country since it was launched last year. The five implementation methods are: one is to transform life, two is to invigorate vigor, three is to eliminate bad habits, four is to break down bad intentions, and five is to correct complicated ideas, all of which are aimed at prescribing the right medicine for the national condition. Another greatest effect is to shatter the Japanese conspiracy and crack down on all activities of the Japanese puppets. This has been clearly pointed out in the National Public Law. This movement is indeed the basic work to strengthen the power of resistance against Japan. Our compatriots must not only practice it themselves, but also encourage their families and persuade society to implement it consistently, so that everyone can faithfully fulfill the wartime decrees of the country, generously repay the contributions that the country should make, and truly achieve a tense, serious, austere, and thrifty life in their own public and private lives, and strive courageously and diligently for the sacred duty of resisting aggression and building the country.

<p>Washington – The Senate Banking Committee recently decided to postpone discussion on Senator Townsend's (Republican) proposal to abolish the Treasury Department's right to purchase silver abroad, at the request of government authorities. Townsend then issued a statement to the newspapers, reiterating his advocacy against the United States continuing to purchase silver from Mexico, saying, "Some say that purchasing silver is necessary to maintain American exports to Mexico. Why not simply give the country millions of U.S. dollars each year to buy goods from the United States?" In short, Mexico's attitude can be compared to a naughty child who knows that his neighbor, though strong, is polite and will not show dissatisfaction or stop giving favors even if insulted, so he kicks him all the more.

<h3 id="e16">American Admiral Yarnell Discusses the Far Eastern Situation, Says the European War Has an Important Impact on the Far East, Advocates an American Embargo Against Japan <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>New York – Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, told reporters last night that the wars in Europe and the Far East are interrelated. The end of the European war will have an important impact on the Far Eastern war; conversely, any resolution of the Far Eastern situation will also be related to the European war situation. As for how the Far Eastern war will end, it will depend on the outcome of the European war. Yarnell also pointed out that the powers involved in the European war possess territories in the East. If these powers are defeated in Europe, it will have a decisive impact on their colonies." Yarnell strongly advocated that the United States impose an embargo on Japan. He said, "I believe that we must impose an embargo on any country that invades another country with cruel means." However, he did not believe that an American embargo against Japan would have a material impact on the Sino-Japanese war in the near future. Yarnell also said that the moral reasons for imposing an embargo outweigh the material reasons. "On the one hand, we are shipping medicine to China to help people injured by Japanese planes, and on the other hand, we are supplying Japan with military supplies. Such contradictory actions can be said to be unconscious." However, Yarnell refused to advocate any special embargo procedure, saying, "Congress will follow the State Department's recommendations. Whether to impose a ban on the export of military supplies to Japan or to invoke the Neutrality Act to prevent the United States from trading with any party except on a 'cash and carry' basis is currently unknown." When discussing the issue of Philippine independence, Yarnell stated that the Philippines is in a hesitant position due to the evolution of the Far Eastern situation. Any action to change the 1936 Philippine Independence Act must be initiated by the Filipinos themselves. The current military force of the United States in the East is insufficient to protect the Philippines. "If" war breaks out, we must retreat to the Hawaiian Islands, using that place as our Western outpost. The Philippines is very easy to occupy, but whether it can be maintained depends on the outcome of the future war. Although the Navy Department is building small naval bases on several islands in the central Pacific, and the Navy Department plans to use 4 million U.S. dollars to improve Guam's facilities, the war to maintain the Philippines will last for a long time, testing the endurance of both sides. The Hawaiian Islands must be regarded as the American western base within the Alaska-Hawaii-Panama triangle of the United States. When a war occurs in the Pacific, that place must be the first "line of defense" of the United States. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>Manila – According to merchants arriving here from Hong Kong, the Governor of Hong Kong recently telegraphed the British Foreign Office, suggesting the establishment of economic warfare sub-offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore, with the aim of controlling war materials shipped to the Soviet Union. Hong Kong exporters have also protested to the British Ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, about the increase in China's exports to the Soviet Union. Sir Archibald replied that he had received assurances from the Chinese side that goods shipped from China to the Soviet Union would not be transshipped to Germany. In addition, the Hong Kong Naval authorities have called on all parties to request London to establish a contraband control center in Hong Kong. Recently, Hong Kong commercial firms have chartered many ships to transport goods to Vladivostok. Foreign trade consultants have asked Chongqing to reconsider the Sino-Soviet barter agreement, because the Soviet Union is now using the agreement to fulfill its obligations under the Soviet-German trade agreement. It is reported that the war materials supplied by the Soviet Union to Germany all come from China. The Soviet ship "Seleger," recently detained by the British Navy, is still in Hong Kong. In addition, two ships fully loaded with steel have recently left Little Luzon for Vladivostok. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>Moscow – The Red Army announced last night that the Mannerheim Line, the main defense line of the Finnish army, was broken by Soviet troops yesterday, and the Red Army vowed to destroy all the enemy. According to the Red Army communique, the Red Army has broken through the first line of the Finnish army in the direction of Karelia, occupying one hundred and sixty-one strategic points, only twelve and a half miles from Vyborg. The communique stated that Finnish resistance on the Mannerheim Line was not intense, and most of them surrendered. The communique also stated that this decision by the Soviet army occupied the most fortified position of the Finnish army on the eastern line. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Moscow – According to a communique from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, on the 17th, in the direction of Karelia, the enemy army retreated rapidly towards the Vamppula area under severe attack by the Soviet army, suffering heavy losses, and set fire to villages and towns along the way. The Soviet army has now occupied many important points, including the city of Ono, on the north bank of Lake Muolaa; the Sienno station, six kilometers southeast of Vamppula; the Kahula fortress area (west of Summa); and the coastal city of Naakka-Marila. In these areas, the Soviet army is pursuing the fleeing enemy troops. In other areas, there has been no significant development. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets. (TASS dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Moscow – A communique released here last night stated that the Soviets have occupied the military stations of Leppiaesses and Kimmila and are continuing to advance. Yesterday, Soviet troops occupied twenty-two fortifications, and during several major offensives, seized forty-two machine guns and one hundred and seventy field guns. Soviet aircraft continued to bomb Finnish troops and military targets. Five Finnish aircraft were shot down. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>Helsinki – An air raid alarm was issued in Helsinki yesterday. Thirty Soviet bombers and fighters invaded the airspace, but did not drop bombs. The alarm was lifted half an hour later, and the Soviet aircraft immediately flew west, and it is expected that they will bomb places such as Tavastehus, Tammerfors, and Aboa.

<p>Stockholm – Telegrams between here and Finland were interrupted yesterday for a time and were restored after several hours. It is heard that an air raid alarm was issued in Helsinki. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – General Mannerheim, a famous Finnish leader, the creator of the Mannerheim Line, issued a notice to the Finnish army on the Karelian Isthmus last night, stating that now is the time when it is necessary to stop the enemy's advance so that the strong Finnish artillery force can hold the new position. He believes that the Soviet army will definitely not be able to break through the Finnish defenses, and a considerable amount of foreign aid is now flowing in. From the overall situation, the hope of Finnish victory is increasing. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – General Mannerheim issued a declaration stating, "From now on, our nation will no longer fight alone. The assistance given by foreign countries is quite considerable, and foreign volunteers are joining our army every day. It is time for us to stop the enemy's advance in the predetermined position. It should be known that there are other positions behind this position, and it is difficult for the enemy to advance to our last line of defense. If we continue to attack, we will only waste our forces. I firmly believe that our people will follow the army, united and steadfast, and I hope that the people of the country will trust the army and God." (Havas dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The Soviet pressure on the northeast of the Karelian Isthmus has eased, and the Soviets are now concentrating manpower and materials in the Summa area. The Finnish side has suffered many casualties due to the Soviet aircraft bombing. It seems that the Soviet army is currently using fewer tanks than before. According to a reporter from the Dagens Nyheter newspaper in Stockholm, the intensity of the air raids suffered by Finland on Saturday and Sunday was unprecedented since the beginning of the war. More than 300 Soviet aircraft bombed 14 towns and cities outside the occupational zone, but there were few civilian casualties and the damage was very minor. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>London – The World News recently published an article by former Secretary of War Belisha entitled "Should We Fight for Finland Now?" The content calls for immediate practical military assistance to Finland, and includes an explanation that the article has been deleted by the inspector for some lines. According to the newspaper, a total of forty-four lines were deleted, at the request of the government, claiming that the passage violated the public policy. However, the newspaper believes that the passage can provide a fair judgment on the issue under discussion. According to the newspaper, this is the first decision made by a British newspaper to indicate that the inspector deleted the text in the above-mentioned manner since the beginning of the war. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Paris – A senior military officer, with the permission of the French command, said today that France is the country that has shipped the most war equipment to Finland. France's assistance to Finland includes aviation equipment, heavy equipment to counter tanks, heavy artillery, pistols, bombs, and a large number of electric fires. France and Britain have agreed to transport this equipment according to their respective capabilities. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London – Well-informed sources here said that although the situation in Finland is very critical, it is not hopeless. After the Red Army recently stepped up its offensive, it has forced the Finnish army to abandon some positions on the Mannerheim Line, but this is the result of major efforts, and it may be difficult to continue in the future. Since the beginning of last month, Britain and France have begun to supply Finland with various military supplies, and the quantity has been considerable this month. It is expected that in the next few weeks, it will not be difficult to strengthen the Finnish army's resistance and enable it to exert greater effectiveness. It is necessary to pay attention to one point, that is, since the attitude of the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula is very hesitant (the statement issued by the Swedish government yesterday is an example), Britain and France can only supply Finland with military fire and volunteers. Other than that, if they want to provide further assistance, they can only send troops directly to land at Petsamo Port in northern Finland. This will constitute an act of war against the Soviet Union. If Britain and France are not prepared to formally fight against the Soviet Union, it is difficult to take this rashly. Moreover, even if Britain and France intend to do so, they must have a solid grasp beforehand to know that this action will be successful. Otherwise, if we cannot stop the Soviet aggression in one fell swoop, we will suffer harm before we benefit, which is not appropriate. On the other hand, the attitude of Britain and France not only needs to shift with the Finnish situation, but is also related to the implementation results of the new German-Soviet economic agreement. If Germany obtains extremely important benefits from this agreement, Britain and France will declare a break with the Soviet Union. In other words, if the Soviet Union regularly supplies Germany with various goods to maintain its combat power, Britain and France may not turn a blind eye. For example, if Soviet kerosene is transported to Germany via the Black Sea in the future, Britain and France will inevitably intervene and must immediately consider it. Regarding this level, well-informed sources here said that according to the Montreux Convention, the total tonnage of warships of various countries that are allowed to pass through the Turkish Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits into the Black Sea should be limited to the total tonnage of the largest fleet currently in the Black Sea, that is, the Soviet fleet. Even if the Turkish government strictly abides by this provision in the future and does not allow Britain and France to send fleets more powerful than the Soviet Union into the Black Sea, it is certain that the British and French navies will be able to cope with the Soviet fleet of equal strength without any doubt.

Germans all know that this unprecedented British crime will surely backfire. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin. Last night, authoritative sources from the National Socialist Party claimed that the German side was extremely dissatisfied with the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, stating that all Allied ships would be armed in the future. Germany will expand its submarine attacks on British and French ships, because if British sailors are armed, then we must regard them as warships. As for neutral country sailors, unless they are protected by British and French warships, this is not the case. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin. A German official agency stated that Britain's decision to arm all ships in the North Sea is an act of undermining the London agreement on submarine warfare. Therefore, Germany is no longer bound by the London Convention regarding the treatment of armed merchant ships. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The captain of the German ship Altmark reported last night on the incident of the ship being intercepted by a British warship and taking away three or four hundred prisoners on board. He said that on Friday, while the Altmark was sailing along the Norwegian coast, three British aircraft repeatedly flew over the ship, apparently communicating with the navy. Soon, a British cruiser and five destroyers sped over. Two Norwegian torpedo boats ordered them to leave. As the German ship prepared to approach the entrance of Jøssingfjord, a British destroyer suddenly approached the German ship, and a team of sailors was clearly preparing to board. The German ship quickly turned into the port. The British ship attempted to pursue, but the Norwegian torpedo boats were anchored across the port entrance, preventing the British ship from entering. At dusk, the British ship actually entered the port, and the German ship received a signal, "If you don't stop, we will bombard you." The British ship quickly sailed alongside the ship, sent troops to board and forcibly occupied the bridge, and opened fire on unarmed German sailors. Some sailors attempted to cross the water or swim to shore, and British soldiers shot at them. The number of deaths and injuries is currently unknown. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The British Navy's attack on the German ship in Norwegian territorial waters has aroused great indignation among the German people. In tea houses, restaurants, and streets, everyone is condemning this move as not only violating Norwegian neutrality, but also a "cowardly assassination." The indignation is unprecedented since the massacre of Germans in Poland, and anti-British sentiment has reached its peak. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital. Regarding the Altmark case, German newspapers are fiercely attacking Britain. The National Socialist Party's newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, stated, "Britain has taken this aggressive action and violated the rights of neutral countries at the same time. The cabinet and naval departments should be held responsible. The tragedy in Jøssingfjord will make our people's determination to avenge their shame even stronger. This is what the British should know." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated, "We now accuse the British Navy of murder. The British Navy's actions are full of shame." The Posen Daily News stated, "Germany attaches great importance to this case and hopes that the Norwegian authorities can also understand this. We must now avenge the heroic sailors of the Altmark."

<p>London. Regarding the German auxiliary ship Altmark case, the Admiralty has just issued a second public statement, describing the search by the British destroyer Cossack, stating: "Our destroyer Cossack was ordered to sail to the mouth of Jøssingfjord in Norway, where it encountered two Norwegian gunboats. Captain Vian of the Cossack boarded the Norwegian gunboat and proposed to the captain that each side send several sailors to board the German ship Altmark and order it to sail to Bergen Port so that everything could be resolved in accordance with international law. However, the Norwegian captain refused, saying that he had received instructions from the government and was unable to do so, and provided assurances that the Altmark had been inspected twice in Norwegian ports and was not carrying British prisoners. After further negotiations, the Norwegian captain agreed to go to the Cossack and board the Altmark with a British officer. At that time, the Altmark disobeyed orders and started its engines, breaking through the surrounding ice in an attempt to ram the Cossack, but when the ship turned, its stern suddenly ran aground and could not move. The Cossack then sent sailors to board the ship, and the two sides immediately opened fire. British leading soldier Miller was wounded. Our sailors then climbed onto the deck and drove the German captain out of the bridge. At this point, the ship was completely under our control. Our sailors also found British prisoners in the storage room and between the shells, and immediately released them one by one. However, several German armed sailors took the opportunity to escape at the stern, stepping on the ice and fleeing towards the coast, and fired rifles at our sailors. Our sailors immediately returned fire, killing two German soldiers, and another one fell into the sea. Two British officers also accidentally fell into the sea and were rescued. Afterwards, six cannons and four machine guns were found on the Altmark, proving that the ship was indeed a German auxiliary ship." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London. The British Air Force Department issued an article last night describing the British Air Force's assistance in rescuing British prisoners of war on the German ship Altmark off the Norwegian coast, stating that the Coastal Flying Squadron, after assisting British ships in detecting the location of the Altmark and conducting long-range reconnaissance flights, formed an escort team to cover the British ship Cossack until it reached port. Four mines were found several miles off the coast of South Jutland in the warship's route. The British ships were immediately warned, and the mines were shot at with machine guns, and two mines were sunk, and the remaining two were cleared by the destroyers. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London. The 208 British prisoners of war detained on the German auxiliary ship Altmark were rescued by British warships and recently landed at Leith, Scotland, on the destroyer Kronk. A large crowd gathered at the dock to welcome them. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Discussions underway between the British and Norwegian governments</p>
<p>London. Norwegian Ambassador to the UK, Colban, was invited to the British Foreign Office last night to hear the British government's views on the Altmark incident and to present a formal protest on behalf of the British government. The official statement stated: "As everyone knows, there are 240 British people imprisoned on the Altmark, enduring unbearable living conditions for months. The Norwegian government must also know this. However, the Altmark was allowed to continue sailing south from Bergen, carrying prisoners, within Norwegian territorial waters. The British government finds this strange, because the British government initially expected that if the Norwegian authorities could not obtain definite proof that there were prisoners on board, they would detain the ship and conduct a more thorough search. However, the Norwegian authorities did not do so, creating a situation where the British government had to take immediate action. The British government believes that in this environment, there is sufficient reason to take immediate action to rescue the prisoners. Given the German side's behavior in naval warfare, completely disregarding the rights of neutral countries and humanitarian concepts, this British action is justified. Therefore, the British government immediately issued appropriate orders to the British ships, and the British ships acted with the full agreement of the British government. In the British government's opinion, the past history of the Altmark and the circumstances of the ship entering Norwegian territorial waters such as Bergen port, all make the Norwegian government responsible for thoroughly investigating the ship's status and its purpose of entering. Since the general public believed that the ship was equipped with weapons for attack, and the ship had a famous record of assisting the German ship Spee's atrocities, there is no doubt that this ship should be regarded as an auxiliary ship, even if it is not regarded as a warship. Therefore, the question of whether the ship should be detained or whether the Norwegian government is responsible for rescuing the prisoners on board needs to be investigated with extreme caution. However, the investigation conducted by the Norwegian side was conducted in a perfunctory and hasty manner. This can be proven by the fact that Norway failed to find more than 300 British prisoners on board. If the British prisoners were sent to German prisoner of war camps as a result of Norway's incomplete search, the British government would have extremely serious reasons to blame the Norwegian government. The above points have now been explained in detail to the Norwegian ambassador. The British government is currently conducting amicable discussions with the Norwegian government." (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>The Norwegian Foreign Ministry and Navy also issued statements on the incident</p>
<p>Oslo. The Norwegian Navy Department issued a statement last night on the incident of the German ship Altmark, stating that a Norwegian torpedo boat escorting the German ship was between the German ship and the British ship HMS Fearless when the British destroyer HMS Fearless and another destroyer intercepted the German ship. The German ship moved towards the coast, and two Norwegian torpedo boats followed closely behind. The Norwegian captain protested against the British ship's violation of Norwegian neutrality. The British captain said that there were 400 British prisoners on the German ship, while the German captain said that there were only 133 people on board. After the Norwegian captain consulted with the German captain, he asked the British ship to leave Norwegian territorial waters. The British ship agreed, but said that it would wait for the German ship outside the territorial waters. At 9:10 AM, the British destroyer HMS Cossack returned and told the Norwegian captain that it had received orders from the British government to rescue 400 British prisoners, whether the Norwegian government agreed or not. A Norwegian officer boarded the British ship for talks but refused the British ship's request to board the German ship with British soldiers. When the conflict occurred on the German ship, the Norwegian officer had already returned to his ship. He did not board the Cossack to watch the battle. After British soldiers led 400 British prisoners away from the German ship, the Norwegian captain boarded the German ship for inspection. The German captain told him that five German crew members had been killed and injured each, and that the German side had not opened fire. Later, there was a rumor that the German captain was privately preparing to destroy his ship, but the German embassy in Norway denied this rumor. There are still 100 prisoners on board the Altmark. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Oslo. The Foreign Ministry recently issued a formal statement saying, "The German ship Altmark passed through our country's territorial waters on the afternoon of the 16th and was immediately monitored by our country's torpedo boats. At 6:30, several British destroyers arrived and fired shots to warn the ship, intending to intercept it. Our torpedo boat captain immediately protested. The German ship then sailed into Jøssingfjord. A British cruiser and five destroyers also sailed out of our country's territorial waters for two miles. However, one British destroyer then sailed into our country's territorial waters. At 11:00 PM, a British cruiser also followed into Jøssingfjord and sent troops to board the German ship and take the British people imprisoned on the ship back to the British ship. At that time, we only had one torpedo boat to watch the British ships, and the number of ships was vastly different. Apart from lodging a strong protest, we were really powerless." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Oslo. Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht said in a speech in Trondheim today that the Altmark case was extremely bad, but if we can defend our country's neutrality, Germany should not have the right to extend the war to our territorial waters. Norway will maintain its neutral policy, even towards Finland. Although Norway deeply sympathizes with Finland, our defense is built on the hope of defending our country. No one can expect any assistance from us. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Oslo. Yesterday afternoon, all newspapers in this city prominently published the news that the German ship Altmark was intercepted by a British destroyer off the Norwegian coast. The Labor Party newspaper stated that this move violated Norwegian neutrality, was extremely serious, and had the nature of a provocation. This is a clear example of Western countries threatening neutral countries. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

According to today's local news, the foreign ministers of the Nordic countries will meet here within ten days to discuss how to jointly deal with the recent heavy losses of Nordic merchant ships. The essence of the problem is probably to adopt a naval escort system to protect the trade of the Nordic countries and neutral countries. Most of the ships recently sunk in the Nordic countries are ships sailing between neutral countries. This kind of behavior directly attempts to completely cut off the external trade of the Nordic countries and put the Nordic countries in an economic predicament.

<p>Stockholm. The relationship between Sweden and Finland is still being fiercely commented on by various newspapers, which proves that the Swedish government's refusal to provide military assistance to Finland has greatly shaken public opinion. The conservative newspaper Svenska Dagbladet stated, "We understand Finland's persistence. We are willing to sacrifice and provide assistance. Our people are deeply concerned about the situation of the country's operations on the Karelian front line. Millions of people listen to the reports on the radio every day. As for Finland's request for our country's assistance, our country's public opinion has no knowledge of it, and Prime Minister Hansson concluded it in a few words. What is the difference between this and a punch in the chest for us?" The liberal newspaper Dagens Nyheter stated, "Although Finland's resistance is extremely heroic, it is difficult to maintain it for a long time due to the disparity in strength. It will inevitably first ask our country for help, and its greatest need is for soldiers. Unexpectedly, Prime Minister Hansson rejected it. We feel like we have been doused with cold water. What is the reason for the government's attitude? It should be explained urgently. As for our country's military situation, the competent authorities must provide various materials so that the people can understand." "Because our country's military strength is insufficient and railway transportation is not well developed, there are indeed various obstacles to military cooperation with Finland, but what is the truth? The military authorities must explain it." The Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning stated, "The day the Russians set foot in Tornio (the border between Sweden and Finland) and the Åland Islands is the day Sweden perishes. Whether the Red Army will be content with conquering Finland in the future or continue to move forward to establish contact with Germany is another matter. But if we allow foreign aircraft to fly to our capital in a few minutes to drop bombs, then our independence will be over. In today's world, the responsibilities of the government authorities are extremely heavy." In addition, the government-run newspaper Social-Demokraten defended the government's position, stating that the government has the right to implement its policies in accordance with the views of the military authorities, but it is also unknown whether Sweden will be in a position in the future where there is no possibility of choosing a path (referring to war).

<p>Moscow. Pravda published an article today, describing Italy's failure in Abyssinia. The newspaper said, "Italian conquerors originally planned to obtain a large number of industrial raw materials in Abyssinia, but they have now been disappointed. The Italian army has occupied Abyssinia for many years, but only 1,500 tons of iron have been transported back to Italy from Abyssinia. As for other reserves, such as copper, coal, mercury, etc., they have not been developed. There are many oil pools in Abyssinia, but Italian colonists have not found them. Italy also originally planned to transport a large amount of cotton, rubber wood, and wool from Abyssinia back to Italy, but the result was another failure. What is even worse is that Italy used to have a large amount of coffee exports, but now it needs to import coffee." "At the same time, according to the Coloniale, Italy's colonial plan has also failed. The Italian government originally planned to move 500,000 households to Abyssinia, but as a result, only 604 households moved to Abyssinia. Abyssinian guerrillas are still very active. Our fascist newspapers are also held by one hand holding agricultural tools, and the other hand holding guns to defend against attacks by aborigines. In short, Italy has not only failed to obtain raw materials in Abyssinia but has also increased the economic burden due to the occupation of Abyssinia. Some economists believe that the failure of the Italian colonial plan is due to financial exhaustion. This statement is quite reasonable." (TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>

How long after marriage without having children can it be considered that one is suffering from infertility? Therefore, some people have made such a stipulation! If it has been three years after marriage and one has not yet become pregnant, it can be determined that one is suffering from infertility.</p>
<p>As for the types of infertility, there are also several types. In the medical community, it can be divided into at least two types. One is absolute infertility, and the other is comparative infertility. The former is mainly due to congenital causes, while the latter is due to diseases that destroy the main parts of the reproductive organs. For example, men's spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, kidney deficiency, and small genitalia. Women's irregular menstruation, mammary gland anemia, and incomplete development all belong to this category.</p>
<p>The most unfair thing is that after one of the couple suffers from infertility, they are blamed on the woman without distinguishing between right and wrong. This kind of behavior is not in line with modern medicine. Because modern medicine has progressed, it proves that the causes of infertility are equally divided between men and women. Therefore, to determine whether there are children, it is only necessary to check whether they are suffering from the above-mentioned diseases, such as the husband's premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and the woman's irregular menstruation, anemia, and yellowing. It is necessary to take the truly male and strong animal gonadal hormone preparations, "Bouticom" for men and women. Besides the above-mentioned gonadal hormone ingredients, "Bouticom" also contains brain-boosting phosphorus, blood-boosting iron, and bone-boosting calcium. The medicinal power is transmitted to the whole body one hour after taking it, and it will exert the real effects of boosting the brain, boosting blood, boosting the kidneys, and boosting essence after 24 hours. I am a specialist in kidney diseases. Based on my 20 years of clinical experience, the most accurate tonic in terms of efficacy is "Bouticom". In the past seven years, I have cured thousands of debilitated and infertile people with "Bouticom", and I have never encountered a single case of failure.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Treatment of Gonorrhea with Modern Methods <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Science is constantly advancing, and the truths it discovers are eternal. This can be demonstrated by the invention of "Klinon," a special drug for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>"Klinon" was invented by Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea research. Dr. Peter dedicated his entire life and spent countless sums of money, finally creating it based on non-specific therapy, using a protein-based yellow mixture. It underwent numerous animal experiments, such as first inoculating apes with gonorrhea, then administering the elements of "Klinon." The result was a cure within five days. Afterward, he experimented on various animals, gradually improving it until it became the world's most popular and effective drug for gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly describe the condition of gonorrhea so that patients can understand the truth. The root cause of gonorrhea is diplococcus (named because it looks like two stacked spheres), which is extremely stubborn and highly reproductive. One becomes two, two becomes four, and in the blink of an eye, it multiplies into thousands upon thousands. Therefore, if one is unfortunate enough to have contact with an unclean woman, gonorrhea often develops within three or four days. At this time, the gonococci are still concentrated in the anterior urethra, making it very easy to treat. In my clinical experiments, patients who take "Klinon" during acute gonorrhea see results within the same day and are completely cured within a week. As for chronic gonorrhea, if the patient has developed prostatitis, cystitis, epididymitis, orchitis, etc., it is more difficult to treat than acute cases because the gonococci have already invaded the posterior urethra and branched out internally. If the gonococci enter the bloodstream from the corpus spongiosum, they will migrate to various places, such as settling in the joints, resulting in gonorrheal arthritis. This type of condition cannot be treated with general over-the-counter medicines. It is necessary to take "Klinon" to cause every cell in the body to develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect and completely cure it. Only "Klinon" has this effect. In addition, for men, use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, according to the diagrams and instructions. For women, use "Carl Scheddi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, inserting one into the vagina every night to eliminate gonorrheal leukorrhea. This is suitable for self-treatment at home. This is the most modern method of treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Patient Qian Xueliang, from Songjiang, is 41 years old (self-report). He says he is naturally weak and fond of alcohol. In the winter of the year before last, he attended a friend's wedding banquet and returned home drunk. It was late at night, and he caught a cold, resulting in a persistent cough. By last spring, he had a lot of thick phlegm and felt a stabbing pain in his chest. Although he received medical treatment, it was ineffective. Last autumn, he suddenly discovered blood spots in his phlegm and had night sweats. That is when he came to me for treatment. (Treatment process) I observed that Mr. Qian's face was pale, he was skin and bones, and he had a high fever. An X-ray examination revealed a silver-dollar-sized cavity in the right lobe of his lung. I instructed him to abstain from alcohol, consume nutritious foods, and rest quietly at home. I prescribed "Lung-Boosting Narl" to fill the cavity and kill the tuberculosis bacteria. After two months, his cough was cured, and his chest pain and night sweats were gone. He continues to take it, and all symptoms have disappeared, with no more blood in his phlegm. His health has been restored.</p>

<p>Patient Zhao Xuemin, 32 years old, has been a businessman in Shanghai for 13 years. He lives in Green Willow Village on Connaught Road in this city. (Self-report) - At the age of 17, he masturbated excessively due to reading too many pornographic books, continuing for three years. His health gradually deteriorated. After getting married at 23, he stopped masturbating, but his body continued to weaken. He also experienced viscous discharge after urination, weak erectile function, and low sexual potency. He has been married for five years but has no children. Although he hasn't masturbated since marriage, nocturnal emissions are unavoidable. (Symptoms at the time of treatment) - Last winter, Mr. Zhao sought treatment. During the examination, his prostate was swollen on both sides, his face was pale, and he weighed only 94 pounds. His urine contained prostatic fluid, and he also suffered from severe sexual neurasthenia. (Treatment process) - His prostate was cooled, and effective massage was performed. He took the German male "Body-Boosting Kang" and the famous drug "Nells Anti-Emission Tablets," which specifically treats nocturnal emissions and spermatorrhea, three times a day, two tablets each time. This completely cured all the above-mentioned conditions. After one month, he gained a little over two pounds, his appetite increased, and his prostate shrank to normal size. By the end of January this year, he had taken a total of five bottles of "Body-Boosting Kang" and two bottles of "Nells Anti-Emission Tablets." All the above-mentioned symptoms were completely cured. He sent a letter to express his gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The More Painful Gonorrhea Is, The Easier It Is to Treat <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>By Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Pain is something that all patients feel, but the degree of pain varies. Among those suffering from gonorrhea, the depth of their pain can be considered the most unbearable. Therefore, it is most appropriate to use "unparalleled pain" to describe gonorrhea patients. When this disease first starts, the urethra feels like ants crawling or insects moving. Then, the urethra feels hot and stinging. And then, this kind of pain becomes more intense, as if sharp needles are piercing the urine, or as if boiling water is being poured on it. The patient naturally cries out in pain, unable to sit or stand still. The painful situation is truly indescribable. Especially when the inflammation of the urethra is at its most intense, wanting to urinate makes the gonorrhea patient feel like there is no way to heaven and no way to earth. Every time urine passes through the lesion during urination, it is stimulated, and the pain is even more severe, and the walls of the urethra also contract. This makes it even more difficult to urinate. Therefore, even after using all one's strength, one still cannot completely empty the bladder. After urination, there is often a feeling of incomplete emptying. I ask, is there any other disease whose pain is so tragic?</p>
<p>However, although gonorrhea is painful in its acute stage, it is also very easy to cure. This is because gonococci mostly cluster in the anterior urethra during the acute stage. Therefore, if the special anti-gonorrhea drug "Klinon" is administered as an internal medicine at this time, its bactericidal power will be concentrated in the anterior urethra, and it can also cause all cells in the body to develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. On the other hand, using German induced static electricity therapy and Weller X-ray therapy alternately, the pain of gonorrhea, although severe, can be stopped day and night, and a complete cure can be achieved in a matter of days, never to recur. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 appointment numbers will be given out each day. Each number costs only 5 jiao and comes with a free copy of the complete book on venereal diseases worth one yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e35">German Foreign Minister's Special Envoy Arrives in Japan to Conduct Diplomatic Activities - Schifferlich's Mission in Japan is to Examine the Current State of Relations Between the Two Countries <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - Schifferlich, manager of the German "Hamburg America Line," commissioned by the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, arrived here on the 13th of this month. His mission is to study the current status and future of German-Japanese relations. In the future, he will likely stay in Japan for several months as a special envoy of the German Foreign Minister. According to well-informed sources, the "Asama Maru" incident is the real motive for the German government to send a special envoy to Japan. Since the rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union in September of last year, not only have German-Japanese relations not developed much, but the Japanese people have also become very indifferent to Germany. The German diplomatic authorities are therefore very anxious. After the "Asama Maru" case was resolved, it was considered a major diplomatic failure, and the plan to promote Japan's accession to the Axis powers was also severely hit. Regarding the "Asama Maru" case, it is said that the German Foreign Ministry expressed dissatisfaction to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, believing that the way the case was resolved showed that Japan was sacrificing German interests to promote pro-British policies. Moreover, Japanese shipping companies even exceeded the limits of government instructions and refused to carry any German passengers. In other words, they not only refused to carry Germans of military age, but also refused to carry any other passengers holding German citizenship. This is one reason. Secondly, the Japanese government prohibited nationals of belligerent countries from traveling from Japan to Korea on Japanese ships, making it increasingly difficult for German nationals to return home via the Siberian Railway. In view of this, the German government sent Schifferlich to Japan to investigate the truth. After returning to his country in the future, he will reportedly answer the following questions in a report: (1) Is there any possibility of further improving German-Japanese relations, and what is the best way to promote diplomatic relations? (2) How strong is the "pro-German element" among the Japanese leadership? (3) How will the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union affect German-Japanese relations? (4) How strong is the pro-British faction in Japan? (5) What are the prospects for the peace movement led by Wang Jingwei? (6) How will Japanese-American relations develop? In addition, Schifferlich will also study various economic issues to determine what kind of assistance Japan can provide to Germany and the Soviet Union in the future. At the same time, he also has orders from Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to investigate how much responsibility the current German Ambassador to Japan, General Ott, should bear for the coldness in German-Japanese relations. Some say that in addition to these things, Schifferlich will also take this opportunity to imply that Germany may be forced to revise its current Far East policy. In other words, Germany may restore its original policy pursued before 1938, that is, the policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek of China. The difference is that this time it will be done jointly with the Soviet Union. In short, it is generally said here that Schifferlich's trip shows that the German authorities are currently very anxious about the possibility of the scope of the European war expanding. Therefore, they still regard Japan as an important factor in the international situation in the coming months and are unwilling to ignore it. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>New York - U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles departed today aboard the Italian mail ship "Laxus" for Italy, representing President Roosevelt in inspecting the overall situation in Europe. Dale, the U.S. President's private representative stationed in Rome, also departed on the same ship. When answering questions from reporters, Welles declined to discuss the details of his mission, stating only that he had no plans to discuss matters with the Pope, but Dale may discuss the possibility of a Vatican Council. Dale made a brief statement, saying that he hoped that this mission could obtain various possibilities to promote the U.S. President's desire to rebuild peace on the basis of freedom and independence for all countries. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Regarding the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State's trip to Europe, the Red Star newspaper commented, "American capitalists have expressed dissatisfaction because the European war has failed to give them the ideal benefits. The British naval blockade has disrupted American trade with European countries and has also affected American trade with Near Eastern countries and some British colonies. This fact has forced the United States to seek new markets. The United States is now closely watching the efforts of Britain and France to create new battlefields, because after the war expands, all neutral countries will be forced to participate and will have to buy raw materials and munitions from the United States. The purpose of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Welles's trip to Europe is to understand how far the British and French plans to expand the war have progressed, and whether the United States can obtain benefits in this regard. American financiers are in fact not concerned about world peace; they are concerned about the evolution of the European war. The real purpose of Welles's trip to Europe is to understand what rewards the United States will receive after helping to expand the war." (TASS, 17th)</p>

<p>Moscow - The "Pravda" newspaper here published an article yesterday titled "The Failure of the British and French Blockade Plan," stating that the plan to blockade Germany has gradually failed. The current British blockade method is the same as during the last World War, but the European situation has fundamentally changed. The Soviet Union has abandoned Britain and France and has improved economic relations with Germany. The recent signing of an economic agreement and the friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union can also guarantee the security of the Baltic Sea and the traffic between Germany and the Scandinavian Peninsula. Germany can be reached on the north, east, and south sides. The world market is in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The United Kingdom has also failed to implement an effective blockade. The blockade of Germany is the dream of British and French imperialists. The plan of the two countries to blockade Germany has obviously failed. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>Rome - Italian-Soviet relations have been commented on by various foreign observers here, saying that although Italy firmly opposes the infiltration of Bolshevik forces into the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean coast, its attitude seems to have changed recently, and it is willing to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union, at least initially through Germany and not directly. For this reason, after Germany and the Soviet Union recently signed a trade agreement, Italy neither felt displeasure nor criticized it. The newspapers of the Fascist Party all strongly stated that this agreement is of great benefit to Germany and can be used to develop Soviet economic resources. In practice, the Fascist Party believes that this agreement is a preliminary attempt to organize a German-Soviet economic group, and the purpose of this group is to pool resources and jointly promote a self-sufficient policy in order to be completely unaffected by the British and French blockade. Sooner or later, Italy will also cooperate economically with Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: The Hong Kong Chinese-American Cultural Association hosted a luncheon at the Hong Kong Hotel on the afternoon of the 14th to welcome the U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, and U.S. Prosecuting Attorney of the U.S. Court for China, Hilmi. Also invited were U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong Safford, Deputy Naval Attaché of the Embassy McHugh, Private Secretary Lai Feng, and Chief Justice of the Hong Kong High Court Sir MacKegilligor, Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau Carley, Minister Wu Tiecheng, Shi Zhaoji, Wang Zhengting, Lo Wenjin, and Li Shufen, among others, with Zhou Shoushen serving as chairman. About 160 Chinese and foreign dignitaries participated in the gathering. After the luncheon, the chairman delivered a welcoming speech and reported on the association's affairs. Then, the Ambassador was invited to make a speech. Prosecuting Attorney Hilmi also spoke after the Ambassador. General Manager of the China Tea Company Shou Jingwei, who had arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Chongqing on the 13th, also attended the banquet and extended a welcome to the Ambassador on behalf of the Chongqing General Association of the Chinese-American Cultural Association. (According to reports, Mr. Shou is the Director-General of the Chongqing General Association.) It is said that the Chongqing General Association had originally planned to hold a celebration on the 20th of this month, Washington's birthday, to commemorate the first anniversary of the establishment of the Chongqing General Association of the Chinese-American Cultural Association. At the same time, a tea party was specially arranged to welcome the Ambassador. However, it is now known that the Ambassador will travel to Chongqing by road and will not arrive until the beginning of March. Therefore, the welcome party must be rescheduled, but the anniversary celebration will still be held as scheduled. The speeches of each person are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhou Shoushen's Speech</p>
<p>"We are gathered here today to hold our ninth luncheon. I am very pleased that you have all participated so enthusiastically. Since the establishment of our association, we have been holding a luncheon once a month as a routine. I am honored that U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson and U.S. Prosecuting Attorney of the U.S. Court for China Hilmi have graced us with their presence. I remember that in November of last year, we were eagerly awaiting the Ambassador's arrival, but unfortunately, due to the weather, the plane was delayed and he could not attend our gathering. Thinking about it now, I still have some regrets. I am very happy that he has finally come today. I am also very pleased to see old friends gathered here, such as former Chinese Minister to the United Kingdom and former Ambassador to the United States Dr. Shi Zhaoji, former Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government Wu Tiecheng, former Ambassador to the United States and honorary president of the Water Association Dr. Wang Zhengting, and Chief Justice of the Hong Kong High Court, Sir MacKegilligor. Furthermore, the fact that American friends, especially women, are so enthusiastic about attending today's meeting adds a lively spirit to this friendly gathering. I would now like to announce some good news: Ambassador Johnson has agreed to give a speech. There is no need for me to introduce the Ambassador. You all know that the Ambassador is one of China's good friends. He is doing his best to promote the diplomatic relations between the two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Ambassador and the United States for the assistance they have provided. Mr. Hilmi will also give us a few words. I hope that Mr. Hilmi will also be one of China's close friends. We would like to hear his wisdom. However, this is not a courtroom. Even if Mr. Hilmi says something, you should not feel worried, because we are all law-abiding residents."</p>
<p>The U.S. Ambassador's Speech</p>
<p>"I missed the opportunity to meet with you in November of last year, but the weather was to blame, so there was nothing to be done. Fortunately, you have all understood. I am very happy to be here today. As agreed in advance, I have not prepared a speech. Therefore, everything that comes from my mouth and enters your ears is not a speech. I enjoyed my trip north, where I traveled extensively in Beiping, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places. I am particularly happy to see old friends such as Dr. Shi Zhaoji, Dr. Wang Zhengting, General Wu Tiecheng, and Sir Zhou Shoushen in Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is truly a peaceful and happy land. As I leaned against the railing of my residence and looked out, I was struck by the turmoil in the world, which increased my sadness. Heavens, if there is a way to achieve peace, I would not hesitate to do my best. Surely your love of peace is no less than mine. I believe that you share my sentiment that it is difficult to reverse the general trend. I think you know where my sympathy lies, so there is no need for me to say it explicitly. China is currently rising in the Southwest. Gentlemen such as Shi, Wang, and Wu, who are present here, and old friends in Chongqing are currently doing their utmost to serve the country. In the future, when the new China is established, you will all be heroes who have worked hard and made great contributions. I am honored to be associated with you. This return to Chongqing is no different from any other return to one's hometown. I have specially invited Mr. Hilmi to accompany me on this trip so that I can enjoy the pleasures of rural life. I will be taking a ship to Haiphong tomorrow, then a train to Kunming, and then traveling by road to Chongqing. I love Hong Kong, but I regret that official duties prevent me from staying longer. If I have the opportunity to visit again in the future, I would like to meet with you again. At that time, I will listen to your guidance and will not speak rashly again. I thank the chairman and all of you for your kindness."</p>
<p>Hilmi's Speech</p>
<p>"As the chairman said, Hong Kong is not an area where my jurisdiction extends. Otherwise, the chairman would be the first person to be punished. Why? Because he forced me to speak. Today, I am very pleased to receive the friendship of Chinese friends. This is indeed an opportunity that is not available in Shanghai. I do not want to say much, but I would like to tell you a story. It happened that an ambassador of a certain country was traveling by ship to take office. Suddenly, it was announced that the ambassador had accidentally fallen into the sea. The whole ship was in an uproar and immediately stopped to try to save him. However, there were many sharks in that area, and everyone thought that there was no hope of survival. Unexpectedly, the first mate suddenly came forward and told the captain that the ambassador was still safely in the sea and that the sharks were not harming him. A passenger sighed and said, 'Is this not a miracle?' The captain replied, 'No, it's just professional courtesy.' Mr. Johnson, what I have described is not referring to you, so please do not misunderstand. When I was in Shanghai, I saw a famous Chinese painting with an attached poem that was quite enough to describe the world today. The original poem meant that the image of light, at first glance, is like darkness. The world situation today is indeed dark, but is this a sign of light?" Hilmi's words were praised as insightful and witty. The guests and hosts were all in high spirits. The gathering ended at 2:15.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Japanese Troops Occupying Chao-Shan, Divergent Strategies of Navy and Army. Navy Insists on Holding the Position, Army Intends to Abandon <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The death toll of Japanese troops occupying Chao-Shan is very significant. Last year, on October 15th, a memorial service was held at the Cheng Jing Shan She in Zhongma Road, Shantou, with 4,500 bags of wooden tablets and ashes of fallen soldiers lined up. Since November, the fighting outside Chao-Shan has not stopped for a single night. Battles took place in Anbu, Sangyoupu Mountain, Niaotagang, Pan'nan Mountain, Jiao Mountain, Huamei, Hong'an Village, Guanchao, Jinshi, Fuyang, Yunbu, Fengxi, Xitang, Xucu Long, Xiangtou Village, Zhuyuan, Chihu, Xia Temple, Tonghu, Guxiang, Qiulang Mountain, Zhulong Mountain, and Bijia Mountain. The casualties of Japanese troops in these battles are estimated to be over four to five thousand. Since the landing of Japanese soldiers in Shantou on June 11th last year, almost 90% of the original force have died. The Japanese troops currently occupying Chao-Shan are all replacements successively drawn from Taiwan, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, without a single complete battalion. According to the observation of Japanese military strategy, Chao-Shan was not originally a major battlefield. It is said that the Japanese army, due to heavy losses, has long had the intention of abandoning it. However, the Japanese navy attaches great importance to Chao-Shan, considering Shantou as a stronghold that must be defended in the navy's southward strategy. It also has significant economic blockade implications, which can isolate eight million overseas Chinese and shake their support for the anti-Japanese war. Given the different viewpoints of the Japanese army and navy on Chao-Shan, last autumn, Huang Dawei, the pseudo "Commander-in-Chief of the First Peace and National Salvation Army Group," set up a pseudo headquarters in Po Hai Cheng with the aim of capturing Fudai. Huang's actions only received support from Rear Admiral Takasu Shiro of the Japanese Navy's South China Fleet. The Japanese army in Chao-Shan did not sympathize. On November 25th, Huang's puppet army attacked Zhao'an along Long, Xiaodong, Huanggang, and Zhelin. The Japanese naval landing force landed along the coast to provide cover, so they were able to quickly break into the territory of Zhao'an. Later, because the Japanese army in Shantou did not feign an attack on Raoping City to cover the coastal line (Provincial Highway No. 1), the puppet troops of Huanggang and Zhelin were cut off by the army and people of Raoping. Lin Zhiyuan was captured in Dagang Township (Zhelin). Only a few of Huang's puppet troops escaped by sea. Those who escaped fled with their guns to Liangshan, at the border of Yunxiao and Tanpu, and more than 700 surrendered to Song Tiancai's division. Since Lin Zhiyuan was sent to Chongqing, several hundred more have surrendered after receiving letters from Lin and being pacified. Huang Dawei returned to Chenghai in defeat, became depressed, fell ill, and vomited blood. Last month, the Japanese army held a military meeting in Zhongshan Park in Shantou City. Huang fell ill in Bo'ai Hospital and did not attend. It is rumored that Huang has died of illness. It is said that when Huang was in Shanghai, the Japanese army promised to allocate one million yuan, 15,000 rifles, cannons, vehicles, speedboats, etc., and had the right to mobilize the Japanese army to assist in the battle. Unexpectedly, Huang was completely disappointed upon arriving in Chenghai, receiving only 3,000 rifles and over 200,000 yuan in military expenses, and the Japanese army did not provide assistance. In mid-January, the Japanese army in Chao-Shan held a military meeting. The army advocated advancing towards Jieyang and Fengshun to respond to the battle in northern Guangdong, while the navy advocated advancing towards Ping and the Fujian border to consolidate the periphery of the Chao-Shan occupied area and obtain sufficient supplies of grain, rice, oil, and salt to ensure Shantou as a key point. On January 20th, the Japanese navy again assisted Huang Dawei in attacking Donglong Lianyang, which was gained and then lost. The Japanese army attacked Fengxi, Xitang, and Qiulang Mountain along various lines, also resulting in disastrous defeats. At this point, the Japanese army in Chao-Shan began to change its strategy and switch to a defensive posture, with the goal of securing the eastern Fujian border and ensuring Shantou, Chenghai, Raoping, and Aonan as its future objectives. Starting on the 8th of this month, they have increased the defensive fortifications along the Chao-Shan Railway and secretly transferred the Chao-Cheng puppet peace army to warships. On the 9th, there were seven Japanese transport ships in Shantou Port. For a time, rumors spread in the city that the Japanese puppets were about to abandon Chao-Shan. In the early morning of the 10th, part of the military supplies from Aonan were unloaded at Qianjiang and sailed towards the South Fujian sea area. On the 11th, there were another forty to fifty large and small ships in the Dongshan Island area of Zhao'an. At noon on the 11th, Huang Dawei's puppet army landed near Hutou Mountain. The local militia briefly resisted and then retreated. With the cover of Japanese aircraft, 1,500 puppet soldiers advanced rapidly towards Zhangpu and Yunxiao, with the aim of attacking Zhangzhou. According to the Japanese navy's strategy, they want to link Zhangzhou and Xiamen together and establish a puppet government in Chao-Shan, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen to realize their cunning scheme of dividing China.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Japanese Troops in Dinghai Harass Northwest Villages, Forty to Fifty Killed <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: More than a hundred Japanese troops and merchants in Dinghai, led by Navy Commander Yamada Mitsuru and the Zhoushan Island Base Unit, landed in the Shaosha Maozhi area of the northwest villages on two Japanese warships. They extorted villages along the way, causing great suffering to the villagers. When they passed Guishan at the intersection of the Xuhe and Chaiwei villages, they encountered the Chinese army, and a fierce battle ensued. In the evening, as dusk approached, the Japanese troops retreated to the coast along the original route, attempting to flee back to their original ships. The Chinese army did not pursue them and returned to their original defense positions. In this battle, an estimated forty to fifty Japanese soldiers were killed, and many rifles and bullets were seized. The Chinese army also suffered slight casualties. In recent days, the Japanese army has been holding fast in the four cities, fearing that the Chinese would take the opportunity to attack. The curfew time has been advanced, and temporary curfews are also imposed at 6:00 AM during the day. The Japanese military headquarters and the puppet autonomous committee have even stricter access control.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Group A Championship Strengthens Further: Lido, the Ever-Victorious Army, Defeats Xibu: 3-1, 1-0 in the First Half, Xibu Scores One Goal Before the End <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Lido's Group A championship is further strengthened. Yesterday, at Jiaozhou Park, they defeated Xibu 3-1 again. Xibu broke the duck egg record in the last half minute. The first half was 1-0. Huang Kehou was absent due to illness. Jiang Chao removed his equipment from the reserve team and returned to the battlefield. His feet were inevitably weak, so many good opportunities were missed. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Lido Team:</p>
<p>Lu Zhong'en, Li Yichen, Zhang Lingen, Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Jiang Chao, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng.</p>
<p>Xibu Team: Willy, Huaite, Xituoweike, Taikeluoke, Peite, Zhuo Shideng, Qieluoli, Zite, Feilunzi Fu, Hute Lai, Fang Saijia.</p>
<p>Jinshun's Diversionary Tactic Scores</p>
<p>Lido has the advantage. Xibu kicks off. Luolizi shoots along the side, soaring into the sky. Fang Saijia is also seen penetrating deeply. Chang Lu is trapped under the nucleus, and only manages to escape after struggling. Xibu's momentum seems quite strong. After a long stalemate, Lido starts to control the overall situation. At 26 minutes, Qiuting passes cleverly to Xiao Xu. Weiketai and Shidengqie hide together, missing Mingsheng, who hooks to the left. Jinshun wants to shoot but does not, and Willy desperately rushes out to block the danger. Right in the middle of Old Sun's diversionary tactic, he gently sends it, rolling into the empty goal. Five minutes later, Lido gets an 18-yard free kick opportunity. Old Sun's shot is too straight, and Willy catches it firmly. At this time, a drizzle is falling, becoming heavier and heavier. A lot of time has passed. Lido attacks more and more urgently, but there are many good opportunities that are lost. The first half ends, still 1-0.</p>
<p>Xiao Xu Scores Against the Wind</p>
<p>After changing sides, Lido faces the wind, making the attack more difficult. But soon the wind stops and the rain clears, and Lido is again in a galloping and slashing situation. Zhuo Lunzifu penetrates deeply once, and Lido's three defenders desperately save the danger. Zhuo's plan is in vain. Qiuting is alone, approaching Xibu's goal, but unfortunately fails to directly attack the Yellow Dragon. The situation at this time becomes undulating like waves. Until the 20th minute, Qiuting cuts in, Jiang Chao jumps with both feet, missing Xiao Xu. A Kui's left foot is flat, flying to the right corner. Wei and leaps up to save, but it is too late, 2-0. Continuing the battle, there are only five minutes left. In a flash, Qiuting breaks through three levels in a row. Weiketai quickly intercepts. Qiuting has already passed horizontally to the center. Jiang Chao attacks with the same plan, can shoot but does not shoot. A Kui then, in the smoke screen, shoots from 15 yards away, flying into the upper right corner. There is only half a minute left. The audience has been leaving one after another. Unexpectedly, Xibu suddenly gets a corner kick opportunity. Hute Lai's opening point is excellent. Zhuo Lunzifu shoots from the side. Chang Lu flies to save, but it brushes the tip of his finger and bounces off the left post into the net. Opening the ball in the middle line, the final whistle sounds, Lido wins 3-1.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Shi Gaotuo Cup Second Round: Donghua Suffers a Miserable Defeat <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Lost 8-1 to Portugal</p>
<p>Xifosi Eliminates French Merchants Yesterday</p>
<p>The second week of the Shi Gaotuo Cup, the two battles between Portugal and Donghua, and Dong Se Lai and French Merchants, which were extended three times, finally competed at Yiyuan and the Racecourse yesterday. As a result, Portugal and Dong Se Lai advanced to the second round with huge scores. Donghua and French Merchants were miserably defeated and eliminated. Those who have now advanced to the Shi Cup second round, in addition to Portuguese merchants and British troops, the other two teams are Lido, the defending Shi Cup champions, and Xifosi, the Group A champions. Next week, the international cup football will begin the second round. The order has been drawn as China vs. Scotland, Portugal vs. England. The Shi Cup final decision will have to wait. The situation of yesterday's Dongpu battle is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua's lineup is scattered since the departure of famous players. Only Xu and Jiang from Hong Kong North's Eastern Three Little Tigers took the field yesterday. Xu Buyun performed better, while Jiang Laishun was not as good as Lin Dianhua. On the Portuguese merchant side, advancing and retreating were orderly, without any loopholes. Kaositan sat in the center, making it difficult for Donghua's five fronts to cross the Thunder Pond for the first 45 minutes. Kelaisha's passing made the Portuguese merchant's score frequently increase to 5-0. After changing sides, Wu Binghao and Lin Dianhua changed positions, slightly increasing Donghua's offensive, but after losing eight goals, Wan Jin scored a goal, ending the game with a score of 8-1.</p>
<p>Portugal:</p>
<p>M Su Ruo, C Leimidi, Gongshanfu, Xue Erfo, Kaositan, A Kui Nuo, B Leimidi, L Luochai Liao, V Su Ruo, Kelasha, I Leimidi.</p>
<p>Donghua Team: Zou Biga, Xu Buyun, Hu Hanwen, Zhang Zhaopeng, Cai Shengsen, Shu Shigeng, Jiang Laishun, Wan Jin, Wu Binghao, Wang Cuixing, Lin Dianhua.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Western League Reserve Team: Dong Se Lai Wins Championship <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Lido Lost to Xifosi Yesterday</p>
<p>Reserve Team football, now also nearing completion. At present, there are only three battles pending: Xibu vs. Donghua, vs. Laks, and Laks vs. North Xi Tong. After Lido's miserable defeat to Dong Se Lai, the British army has a great grasp of the championship. In yesterday's Lido vs. Xifosi battle, Lido must win by at least 4-0 to seize Dong Se Lai's championship seat. If they lose one goal, then Shi must win by 8-1, which is still useless. Lido, in view of the fact that one cannot have both fish and bear's paw, had already decided to give up the battle against the Soviet army in advance yesterday. After the start of the game, Lido had many good opportunities, but unfortunately did not succeed. Minutes before the break, the Soviet army's left wing Fabiansheng scored a goal. In the second half, due to being in a headwind position, they were attacked fiercely by the Soviet army. In a short period of time from 25 minutes to 35 minutes, Luo Qishibis scored three goals in a row, resulting in a 4-0 defeat. Now the top three teams in the top group have each been decided. Dong Se Lai has 7 wins, 2 draws in 9 games, with a score of 18, champion. Xifosi has 6 wins, 3 draws in 9 games, with a score of 15, runner-up. Lido has 7 wins, 2 losses in 9 games, with a score of 14, third place. The yellow parcel belongs to French merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e58">After the Signing of the Police Agreement, Various Circles Have Different Views; Foreigners Are Not Enthusiastic, While Chinese People Are Disappointed; There Are Many Difficulties Regarding Funding and Organization <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that Major Bowen, Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police, will hold a meeting with Lu Ying, the "Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau," in the next few days to discuss the detailed organization of the special new police force in the Western District, which was agreed upon by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government." The location of the team's office has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Police Force Organization Still Awaiting Negotiation</p>
<p>According to "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an's statement to reporters, the organization of the joint new police force will be discussed at a meeting to be held in the next few days. However, the date of the meeting has not yet been decided. The "Municipal Government" will use the income from the Western District to develop the area. Regarding the transfer of funds to banks, it is said that he has not yet discussed financial issues in detail with the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities.</p>
<p>Huge Sums Have Been Spent on Development of the Western District</p>
<p>When reporters mentioned that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities had spent huge sums of money developing public interest projects in the Western District, Fu said that when this issue is raised for discussion, he will request to see the profit and loss statement, meaning that he will conduct a detailed review of the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities' income and expenditures.</p>
<p>New Police Officers Number 1,200</p>
<p>Also, the "Shanghai Times" reported that since the agreement on the special police force in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads Area was signed on Friday, there has been much speculation in the city yesterday (the 17th) regarding the number of personnel and the general organization of the force. Although there has been no direct discussion between the two parties on this matter, it is heard from reliable sources that the new police force will consist of approximately 1,200 officers and constables. Based on the size of the area under the force's jurisdiction, it is expected that four police stations will be established in the district.</p>
<p>Searching for Police Station Buildings Will Take Time</p>
<p>The agreement signed by Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and "Mayor of Shanghai" Fu Xiao'an, stipulates that the number and organization of the new police force shall be handled by the "Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" and the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police. After the establishment of the special police force, it will have the exclusive right to operate in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area during the term of the agreement. However, it is expected that the organization of the police force cannot be completed in a short period of time, as in addition to selecting police officers and constables, there is also the issue of finding suitable buildings in the area to serve as police stations.</p>
<p>Separate Regulations for Police Officer Insignia</p>
<p>A key feature of the agreement signed on Friday is that the special police force is established by the "Municipal Government" and wears distinctive shoulder badges or insignias, and has exclusive powers in the district. The organization of the police force personnel will be determined by the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police and the "Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau."</p>
<p>Personnel Selection Awaits Consultation</p>
<p>According to the provisional terms, a portion of the police force members, including some key officers, shall be appointed by the "Shanghai Municipal Government" from candidates recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Undoubtedly, after consultation between the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police and the Deputy Commissioner, it will take a long time to submit a list of Shanghai Municipal Police officers. If these police officers are approved by the "Shanghai Municipal Government," they will be assigned to the special police force. It is heard that the police force commander will be appointed by Fu Xiao'an, while the deputy commander will be appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Police.</p>
<p>Police Officers' Benefits and Privileges to Be Retained</p>
<p>One of the terms of the agreement stipulates that "The head of the police station in the area where foreigners have large properties, and a number of officers determined through agreement, shall be appointed by the "Shanghai Municipal Government" from candidates recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council." The future of these Shanghai Municipal Police officers will then become an issue, as they will still expect to retain all rights and privileges when assigned to the special police force, such as promotions during their service in the Shanghai Municipal Police. Their salaries in the special police force will also be comparable to those in the Shanghai Municipal Police.</p>
<p>Detective Agency To Be Organized Separately</p>
<p>In addition, there are various other issues that need to be decided. Although there has not been much progress in the discussion of various plans to date, it is generally expected that Shanghai Municipal Police officers assigned to the special police force will still be considered Shanghai Municipal Police personnel and have full rights and privileges. After the establishment of the special police force, it will soon establish its own detective division, which will fully cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Police and the "Municipal Police Bureau."</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Views Differ</p>
<p>Also, the "China Press" reported that the reactions of people in the city to the agreement between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" on police affairs in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area yesterday were varied. Foreigners generally approve of the agreement in principle, but do not express great enthusiasm, and generally believe that the agreement is a step in the right direction on paper. However, foreigners also feel skeptical and believe it is best to wait and see how the words can be translated into action. As for the Chinese, although they acknowledge that the agreement may solve the problem of crime in the city, they say that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" may interpret the Shanghai Municipal Council's willingness to sign the agreement as a de facto recognition of the puppet regime, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Is Very Pleased</p>
<p>Only the reaction from the Japanese side has been absolutely welcoming of the agreement, calling it a historical document and congratulating the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" on signing the agreement. As for the reaction of the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is not yet known. It is heard that since the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that it is appropriate to sign the agreement, it will naturally approve it. However, it is claimed that no matter how the "Municipal Government" treats the agreement thereafter, it will not be detrimental to the Shanghai Municipal Council. There are now two possibilities: (1) If the "Municipal Government" cooperates in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, it will be beneficial to the public interest; (2) If the "Municipal Government" refuses to comply with the terms of the agreement, it will permanently prove that the "Municipal Government" has no sincerity, and the unstable situation should be entirely blamed on the "Municipal Government."</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Goal of Price Stabilization Is Persistence; Request for Statutory Foreign Exchange; Worried Because the Compensation Funds Are Still Not Enough; Rice Prices at Retail Stores Have Not Fallen, Hope for Strict Punishment <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee decided to implement the second phase of price stabilization from February 23rd. The Rice Merchants Association has passed a resolution to accept the entrustment to handle it, stipulating that 40 price stabilization locations will be set up in the two settlements. The locations will be announced after the Rice Merchants Association decides. All procedures are being rushed to ensure implementation as scheduled. Regarding the time of price stabilization, it has been changed to run from 1:30 PM to 6:00 PM until sold out. Each location will stabilize the price of 50 bags per day. Each person is limited to purchasing one yuan, which is equivalent to 5.5 catties, which is half a catty less than the first phase.</p>
<p>Request for the Supply of Statutory Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The 15th, 30th, and 6th branch associations of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union, in view of the food difficulties last year, after negotiating with Yu Qiaqing and others, initiated the purchase of foreign rice and were approved to supply statutory foreign exchange to regulate the situation temporarily. The benevolence was widely received and Shanghai was grateful. Now the problem of people's food is severe, and the situation is even worse than in the past. Citizens are starving and crises are lurking. The People's Food Regulation Association, although organizing price stabilization, is limited by its financial resources and cost relations, and it is still difficult to reverse the current situation. Therefore, it has specially sent a letter to the People's Food Association, requesting it to earnestly present to the National Government authorities to invoke the previous example and specially approve statutory foreign exchange for Shanghai's future stabilization of foreign rice prices in order to relieve the poor people's suffering and suppress the rising prices.</p>
<p>Continuing Fundraising for Persistent Price Stabilization</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization Committee previously stipulated that the price stabilization donation fund was 1 million yuan in national currency. After enthusiastic donations from various industries and social donations, the total amount of donations received has reached 567,459 yuan and 4 jiao and 3 fen. There is still a long way to go to reach the goal. The association continues to raise funds to ensure that it reaches the 1 million yuan goal so that price stabilization can be sustained. It is heard that various industries have decided to continue to apportion the funds. As for the agencies that receive donations, they are still Shanghai Jin Cheng, Fu Yuan, Tong Run, and other banks and businesses. In addition, the association has purchased approximately 80,000 bags of broken rice. In addition to the 34,000 bags sold in the first phase, there are still 46,000 bags remaining.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Have Fallen Back, But Retail Prices Have Not</p>
<p>More than 500 rice stores in the city closed down the day before yesterday for fear of being robbed by civilians, and have not yet reopened yesterday. However, retail sales continued as usual. The market was sluggish, so prices have fallen back again. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon Tokyo fell 8 jiao per tip, while grain rice fell about 1 yuan each, and Bai Yuan fell about 1.5 yuan each. Danyang white rice fell even more, dropping 2 yuan. However, the retail prices of rice stores have not decreased, and it is hoped that the relevant authorities will impose strict sanctions.</p>
<p>A Rice Riot Occurred in Pudong</p>
<p>Although the price of domestic rice in Pudong District differs from the settlements by more than 10 yuan, the highest price has reached 40 yuan per picul. Starting yesterday, the rice stores also unanimously hoarded goods, hiding good rice and only selling broken rice in stores, also at 40 yuan per dan. The general poor people were greatly panicked. At 9 AM, a rice riot occurred at Yanjiabao, on the border of Shangnan. At that time, Yuanchang Rice Store on Dongchang Road went to Zhoupu to purchase 48 bags of rice. On the way back, when passing through Yanjiabao, hundreds of poor people completely robbed all the rice. In the afternoon, hundreds of poor people also robbed rice stores in Xitangqiao and other towns in the south. At 2 PM in Yangjiadu Town, 500-600 poor people gathered, holding rice baskets and flour bags, and were preparing to rob rice when they were suppressed and dispersed by Japanese troops. If rice prices continue to rise, a more serious wave of unrest will be triggered in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Coal Briquette Industry Has Resolved to Implement Price Stabilization Tomorrow; Wholesale Price Is 110 Yuan per Dan, 5.8 Yuan; Limited to Clearing Warehouse Receipts within 10 Days, Overdue Receipts Will Be Canceled <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday received a letter from Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, ordering them to suppress and stabilize the prices of rice and coal briquettes, and stating that rice is a necessity for people's food and coal briquettes are a daily necessity for fuel. Now that market prices have soared, it is related to the livelihoods of 3 million citizens and they are ordered to suppress and stabilize prices. If hoarding and price gouging occur, once verified, they will be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>All Sectors Negotiate to Suppress Coal Prices</p>
<p>Leaders from all walks of life, such as Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyi, and Lin Kanghou, especially invited Chen Cuifang, Chairman of the Coal Briquette Industry Association, and representatives from various coal briquette factories the day before yesterday to discuss ways to maintain fuel for the common people. It was decided on the spot that: (1) Openly stipulate a unified coal briquette price; (2) Limit the time for hoarders to clear their warehouse receipts (the above are temporary measures); (3) Find ways to reduce freight for coal dust needed by various factories (this is a fundamental solution). According to the current factory price, based on current costs, it is said that it is still less than the cost.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Price Stabilization Will Be Implemented Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association convened a joint meeting of various manufacturers at 4 PM yesterday. Representatives from 18 companies, including Yitaixing, Guohua, Jingye, and Dongfang, attended. After Chairman Chen Cuifang reported the purpose of the meeting, it was resolved on the spot that: (1) Starting from the 20th of this month (i.e., tomorrow), price stabilization will be implemented. The retail price will be 5.8 yuan per 100-catty dan, and the wholesale price will be 110 yuan per ton, with an additional 2 yuan for labor; (2) Negotiate with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to publish a notice in the newspaper that customer warehouse receipts must be delivered within 10 days, otherwise they will be taken back at the original price and no goods will be delivered.</p>
<p>Coal Reserves Reach One Million Tons</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency approached Mr. Bao Xixiang, a member of the Coal Industry Committee, yesterday to inquire about the coal reserves in Shanghai and ways to suppress market prices. According to Mr. Bao, there is no shortage of fuel in Shanghai as a whole. Coal scraps from Annam and other places arrive every day. Although there are many uses at present, the coal stockpiled in Shanghai East and West warehouses has reached more than 1 million tons, which is enough for 4 million Shanghai citizens to use for one and a half years. It is clear that the rising market prices are caused by manipulation and monopoly. To suppress market prices, it is essential to purchase in large quantities, reduce freight costs, and urge existing inventory to be released from warehouses. This will result in a glut of spot coal, a balance of supply and demand, and falling market prices.</p>
<p>Hoping the Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong continued, "The soaring price of coal in Shanghai is not only related to the entire industry, but also poses a serious threat to the livelihoods of ordinary people. Although the members of the association are aware of this situation, they are ultimately unable to do anything due to their lack of resources and energy. It is hoped that the authorities of both settlements will promptly send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation of coal reserves, urge the release of goods from warehouses, and sell them at stable prices in order to stabilize coal prices. It is heard that the Fuel Committee of the Settlements is paying close attention to the rising coal prices and convened a committee meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures. Therefore, the overall fuel problem in Shanghai can be gradually stabilized. It is hoped that citizens will remain calm and not privately purchase and hoard, so as to avoid reducing existing inventory.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the isolated army erecting barbed wire and beating innocent citizens, Commander Xie issued the following statement: "All sectors have sent letters to inquire about and comfort "the isolated army and the number of injured civilians and the current situation." No one in the isolated army was injured. Everyone should no longer worry about the incident of hanging the national flag on August 11, in which 111 officers and soldiers were killed or injured. Now that it has been agreed that the flag can be raised on every anniversary, there is no need to take any precautions. We were suddenly attacked and were unable to respond to the enemy in a hurry. This is our failure. From now on, we will only fight to the end. Regarding the civilian injuries, in addition to the five people who have been announced, it is impossible to investigate others. Except for Chen Jin and Jin, whose head and arm injuries have changed, I sent them to the hospital for treatment yesterday. The other four people go to the hospital for treatment every day. I will fully bear all medical expenses, so there is no problem. I received 20 yuan in cash from the Zide Academic Research Association to comfort the injured civilians and sent someone to transfer it to them separately and express my gratitude. I cannot reply to all the letters from all sectors here, so I would like to express my gratitude here."</p>

<p>Since the Central Bank issued fractional currency, the total amount has reached 2 million yuan, and a large amount of it has been circulated in the market. The fifth batch of 500,000 yuan has been scheduled to be issued starting today. At present, various stores in the city mainly use tram substitute coupons, bus tokens, and coupons from the four major companies in the two settlements for change. Now that the fifth batch of fractional currency coupons has been scheduled to be issued starting today, the shortage of auxiliary currency can be gradually eliminated. Therefore, starting yesterday, stores in the French Concession have mostly refused to accept substitute coupons, and generally use fractional currency coupons to change customers.</p>

<p>In order to maintain people's food and relieve the poor, the flour factory industry has decided to designate 27 flour stores in the two settlements to be responsible for implementing stabilized prices for one month. Fufeng and Fuxin will supply the flour, providing 7,500 bags per day, including 5,000 bags of Fufeng "Red and Blue Car Brand" and 2,500 bags of Fuxin "Red Fuxin Brand." Each bag weighs 49 pounds.</p>
<p>All will be sold at the stabilized price of 10 yuan and 3 jiao. The factory wholesale price is 10 yuan, and the retail price is increased by 3 jiao for handling fees. Each person is limited to purchasing one bag at a time. 27 flour stores, including Ruiji, have already received goods from Fufeng and Fuxin yesterday and will implement stabilized prices starting today. The order of the price stabilization stores will be maintained by the police department of the settlement authorities. The price stabilization time is from 9 AM to 12 PM and from 2 PM until sold out. Only other brands of flour will not be sold during the price stabilization period.</p>
<p>Machine-Made Noodle Shops Decide to Close</p>
<p>In view of the soaring price of flour, the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association held a temporary members' meeting yesterday morning and decided to temporarily close down starting today (the 19th) with pain. They also sent four representatives, Wang Jinwen, Zhu Changgeng, Wang Fuxin, and Zhu Kunlin, to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition, requesting that they take measures to provide relief, so that they can purchase directly from manufacturers and benefit the common people. It is heard that in addition to advising them to resume business, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has promised what they requested. It is heard that starting today, more than 200 noodle shops, including Zhu Daxing, Wang Yuanlong, and Wang Maoxing, in the Public and French Concessions will temporarily close down.</p>
<p>Petition the Chamber of Commerce for Relief</p>
<p>The association's official document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday stated, "This is to petition for the skyrocketing price and shortage of flour. The association convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday. The members from various markets in the city reported that they had no goods to make and were forced to decide to suspend business with pain on February 19th. We are deeply afraid that the authorities will question us, so we are submitting this report to your association in advance, begging you to transfer it to the authorities to dredge the source, negotiate with manufacturers to directly supply the association, and then distribute it to the members in the market according to a fixed quota. The association will register with each store and is responsible for managing the goods, and hoarding is not allowed. The association is responsible for handling it. Please also ask the authorities to limit the price of flour to no more than 10 yuan and quickly handle the foreign wheat to relieve the flour shortage and benefit the business, so as to benefit the people's food.</p>

<p>Prices are rising, and the entire city of Shanghai is shaken by it. Employees who are paid salaries are already on the verge of not being able to maintain their livelihoods. Most industries made profits last year and should give special consideration to their employees. Mr. Yu Zhiqing has already made an earnest appeal, hoping that employers will voluntarily provide subsidies to their employees to help them get through the difficulties. The authorities of the settlements and various public organizations are all expecting employers to do this. Voluntarily increasing employees' benefits will not only prevent labor-management disputes, but will also increase social purchasing power, which will benefit each individual industry. Without this path of coexistence and co-prosperity, the future of the entire commercial industry will be unimaginable. Yesterday, someone from the labor circle suggested to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce that they immediately send a letter to all trade associations in the city, transferring it to all member factories and businesses, to provide as much advances to employees as possible and participate in group purchases of rice and coal, and issue them to employees' families at stable prices in order to reduce the burden and allow employees to focus on their work without being burdened by their livelihoods.</p>

<p>The World Class liners of the American President Lines have stopped serving this city since August 13th, for two and a half years. It was previously reported that the company would resume serving Shanghai with its World Class liners, which was reported earlier. It is now learned that the first ship to arrive in Shanghai, the President Garfield, passed through Japan the day before yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in port at 9 PM today, docking at pontoon numbers 12 and 13. Passengers will transfer to the Manilamar small ferry and land at the New Customs Pier at 10:30 PM. The large liner will leave for Hong Kong, Luzon, Singapore, Mumbai, and other places at 6 PM tomorrow (the 20th), passing through the Mediterranean Sea to New York. The last small ferry to send passengers off will depart from the New Customs Pier at 4:30 PM tomorrow afternoon. It is heard that this is the first time the ship has come to Shanghai and there are over 100 passengers, of whom 29 will land in Shanghai, while the rest are travelers to Nanyang and around the world. According to the company, in order to respect the US neutrality act, it will not stop at Marseille, France, in the Mediterranean Sea because France is a belligerent country. Therefore, after reaching Genoa, it will sail directly to New York. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhishadani will arrive in Shanghai from Surabaya today.</p>

The owners of the gambling dens say that this matter will affect the livelihoods of more than 1,500 employees of the gambling dens and demand that the closing period be extended by half a year.

<p>The English-language "China Evening News" reported that the Japanese "Continental New News" reported this morning (the 18th) that three British soldiers from the West Forth Highlanders entered the Oriental Café, run by Japanese at No. 215 Mount Heslop Road, on Tuesday night to drink alcohol. They got into an argument with the café employees over a trivial matter. Two British soldiers tried to take two bottles of whiskey away. Suddenly someone turned off the lights, causing a brawl. One British soldier was injured and sent to the hospital. Afterwards, the British soldiers intended to settle the matter by paying 95 yuan through a police officer. However, the café side refused. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Consul General decided to conduct an investigation and lodge an official protest with the British Consul General, demanding an official apology, disciplining the British soldiers involved, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future.</p>

<p>Every Station Has a "Draft Team"; Trains Are Always Searched Strictly</p>
<p>Someone from Wangdian said that recently, the Japanese side, feeling that its military strength is not enough to be allocated, has implemented a vicious policy in various occupied areas. That is, a "draft team" is set up at every railway station. If any strong and able-bodied Chinese are found, they are forced to be taken to a certain place to listen to their commands, share the burden of transportation and construction work, and are whipped if they are not careful. In addition, in order to prevent Chinese guerrillas from mixing in, the Japanese army has been strictly checking train passengers, often hindering the train's running time. Every train that passes through must be harshly searched by the Japanese army. Anyone who is strong and able-bodied or is suspected is taken away. Therefore, the early train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, which departed from Wangdian yesterday, departed at 9:15 AM and was supposed to arrive in Shanghai at around 12:00 noon, but when the train passed Jiashan, the Japanese army forced passengers to get off the train for inspection for two hours, and five Chinese people were taken away. The train did not arrive at the Shanghai North Station until 2 PM.</p>

<p>The "China Press" reported that a major merchant from Tianjin recently arrived in Shanghai. He told reporters yesterday (the 17th) that he has been traveling in Tianjin for 35 years and has never seen the situation as bad as it is today. Unless the current situation changes, he does not know how foreign businessmen can continue to exist. Foreign business firms are gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>Coal Is as Expensive as Gold, Rice Shortages Are Even Worse</p>
<p>The Japanese in Tianjin are doing everything they can to make it extremely difficult for businessmen to operate. Now, most foreigners are reminiscing about the prosperous times before the war. Before the Lunar New Year, Tianjin was very cold, and the situation was made worse by the coal shortage. Coal prices once soared, as expensive as gold. When he set off for Shanghai, the weather had warmed up, but rice and grain were also very scarce in Tianjin.</p>
<p>The Japanese Compiled Shandong Tobacco</p>
<p>Foreign tobacco companies that used to import large quantities of tobacco from Shandong can no longer do so. If they want to import, they must purchase from a company managed by the Japanese. However, the tobacco obtained is less in quantity and inferior in quality than what was ordered. Sometimes, when ordering first-class tobacco, they receive third-class goods. Those who have connections with the company have priority in obtaining first-class tobacco, which is very unfair.</p>
<p>All Kinds of Food Are Very Scarce</p>
<p>All kinds of food in Tianjin, especially perishable food, are still very scarce. Large companies in the settlements have to rent trucks to transport food into the settlements themselves. The rental fee for trucks is 15 or 20 yuan per hour. They are searched along the way, causing delays for several hours. Even if the food does not spoil during the period of being stopped, the rent for the trucks that the company spends is already very expensive. Due to the high cost of transporting food, food in the settlements is half as expensive as outside the settlements. Regarding the "Federal Reserve" banknotes, their value may continue to fall within the next week.</p>

<p>Since the opening of Zhabei, Hongkou, Yangshupu and other places on the morning of the 15th of this month, many Chinese people without permits from the Japanese Concession have gone to the above-mentioned places to visit. However, when passing through the New Zha Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Waibaidu Bridge, and the two openings of North Jiangxi Road, Hairan Road, and Wenjianshi Road, everyone must</p>
<p>take off their hats and salute</p>
<p>the Japanese Marine Corps sentries, otherwise they would be beaten immediately or not allowed to cross the bridge. In peacetime, Chinese women holding passes and other permits did not need to salute when passing the New Zha Bridge. However, it is different since it opened. Regardless of men or women, they must salute the Japanese sentries. Therefore, in recent days, many men and women who forgot to take off their hats or whose salutes were not good were</p>
<p>violently beaten and injured</p>
<p>by Japanese soldiers with iron and wooden sticks, rifle butts, etc. The day before yesterday afternoon, several Chinese women were beaten in the head and bled profusely because they did not know how to salute. Many other men were also beaten and injured, with their heads bleeding. Therefore, yesterday, the number of pedestrians on the bridge decreased compared to the previous few days. At around 10:30 in the morning, a British man in his fifties or sixties, with white hair and wearing a yellow woolen coat, looking like a merchant, was</p>
<p>stopped by Japanese soldiers</p>
<p>and forced to salute when he passed through the New Zha Bridge from the concession to Zhabei because he did not take off his hat. The British man refused and turned back to the concession. In addition, the Wuzhen Road Bridge in the New Zha area of the Public Concession, which spans the Suzhou River, was previously unable to be used due to damage to the bridge surface. Therefore, the Japanese side blocked the southern end of the bridge with iron wire and wooden frames, and the concession side also closed the iron gate at the same time. It is now known that the bridge has been slightly repaired, so it has been opened to traffic as usual since yesterday. Previously, only one iron gate on the east side was opened, but now both the east and west sides are fully open.</p>

<p>Bullet Hits Right Arm</p>
<p>Fear of Permanent Disability</p>
<p>Huang Bugao, a watchman at the Shanghai New Hotel, No. 579 Jiujiang Road, Public Concession, 37 years old, from Chongming (number 1782), was suddenly shot at by three thugs at 8:30 last night. The bullet hit his right arm. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in different directions. By the time the nearby Chinese police arrived, the criminals had already disappeared. They quickly called an ambulance and sent Huang Bugao to Renji Hospital for treatment. Huang's right arm bone was broken, and he may be permanently disabled. It is said that a month ago, a passenger took a rickshaw to the New Hotel. When the rickshaw arrived in front of the hotel, an argument broke out between the passenger and the rickshaw puller. The watchman helped the rickshaw puller and slapped the passenger in the face. Later, the passenger still booked a room at the New Hotel and told a waiter that he would kill him one day. The reason for Huang's attack may be the passenger's retaliation. However, according to Huang, the faces of the three thugs were different from the passenger's.</p>
<h3 id="e73">US Transport Ship USS Chaumont's Relationship with the Shanghai War, The First Naval Reinforcements Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Xiu Quan</p>
<p>The USS Chaumont, one of the six major transport ships of the United States Navy, was ordered by the Navy Department on November 3, 1921, to sail between the Far East and the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in San Francisco, USA. Now that it has been in service for nineteen years, it is about to leave the Far Eastern waters and return to its home in the United States. There are many things worth mentioning about the ship's history with the Shanghai War, so the following is a brief summary:</p>
<p>The USS Chaumont was built in Hog Island, eastern United States, in 1920 and is one of the six major transport ships of the United States Navy. The ship weighs 11,000 tons, is 448 feet long, and 58 feet wide. In the same year, the US Navy Department built six transport ships of the same class in Hog Island, which only took 19 days to sail from the United States to the Far East. There are also two sister ships: one is the USS Accony, which is dedicated to carrying food and military supplies, and the other is the USS Ryder, which is used to transport ammunition, airplanes, tanks, and artillery. The USS Chaumont joined the Far East voyage in 1921. On August 6, 1924, after completing the work tasks of the Navy Department headquarters, it was ordered to sail to the Norfolk waters of Virginia, and then it would come to the Far East twice a year. The USS Chaumont once carried US Navy personnel to Haiti and transferred to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in western Cuba, West Indies, for service. From there, it sailed to the Panama Canal, stayed overnight, and passed through the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and then turned from the Bell Department to San Diego.</p>
<p>The USS Chaumont was stationed between San Diego, St. Paul, and San Francisco, and it was responsible for transportation matters in the Far East, including Honolulu, Guam, Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Qin Island in the Pacific Ocean. The first time the USS Chaumont arrived in Shanghai was in 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army had just conquered Shanghai. At that time, the USS Chaumont was on alert in Nicaragua because of a conflict between the local important official Sandino and the US Navy. It was then ordered by the Navy Department to rush to Shanghai to strengthen the defense of the concession. This was on February 24, 1927. On March 21, it returned to the United States and came to Shanghai again to protect the voyage of the President Pierce, which carried the commander of the US Fourth Naval Fleet to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The US Navy's second deployment to Shanghai was also carried out by the USS Chaumont, which arrived on February 5, 1932, when the "January 28" Shanghai War broke out. The ship was ordered to carry US Navy personnel from Manila to Shanghai to strengthen the defense of the concession. When the "August 13" Shanghai War broke out in 1937, the USS Chaumont once again carried personnel from the US Navy's Sixth Detachment and Brigadier General Simon Dewitt Buckner Jr. of the US Navy's Second Brigade to Shanghai. During that voyage, the USS Chaumont broke its previous voyage record and departed from San Diego fully loaded with military supplies and naval personnel on August 29 of that year, arriving in Shanghai on September 19 in 21 days. After the sudden outbreak of the August 13 Shanghai War, the USS Chaumont helped American expatriates in Yantai, Qingdao, and Tianjin evacuate to Shanghai, and carried some expatriates back to their home country via Kobe, Japan. Later, it sailed to Shanghai again and carried American expatriates to Hong Kong. The USS Chaumont performed more arduous tasks in the US Navy Department, and its achievements far surpassed those of other transport ships. Even on the way to the Far East, the ship helped other US ships that were damaged by storms. On December 16, 1936, when the USS Chaumont was six kilometers away from the sea off Qinhuangdao, it worked hard to help the USS Gold Star rescue the US Navy personnel who were in distress there and bring them to Shanghai. It is reported that the US Navy Department, considering that it has served in the Far East for 19 years, will recall it to San Diego, USA, and replace it with two other US transport ships. This will be seen in August next year. As for the US transport ship USS Henderson, which left Shanghai on January 28, it will still sail to Shanghai in the near future to strengthen the defense.</p>

<p>Children Playing in the Road</p>
<p>Parents Should Be Vigilant</p>
<p>Zhu Gengshou, a Suzhou boy living at No. 5 Yufu Lane, Kangdi Road, is 15 years old and an only child. His father died when he was five years old. His mother, Ms. Wang (45 years old this year), relied on her ten fingers to work as a female worker to raise him. At 5:30 p.m. on the 15th, while playing with other children in front of No. 557 Beile Road, an empty truck with the license plate F-257, driven by Zhao Honggui (39 years old) from Tongzhou, was driving slowly from south to north. Zhu and the other children were pushing and teasing the truck from behind when Zhu accidentally tripped and fell to the ground and his head was crushed by the rear wheel. The police saw this and rushed him to Guangci Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. The police took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room. The next day, they reported it to the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who came to the scene to verify the cause of death. The police also sent the driver and witnesses to the police station for questioning. The official handed over the body to his mother for burial. The police department handled the driver according to the law. It is now heard that the police investigation concluded that the driver was not at fault and that the deceased was responsible for his own death, so he was not prosecuted and the driver was released. The deceased's mother felt aggrieved that her only son was tragically crushed to death and the driver was able to escape responsibility, so she expressed her dissatisfaction and planned to seek legal remedies on her own in the hope of punishment and compensation for damages.</p>

<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, personally sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications, reconsidering the matter of married women serving in various agencies of the Ministry of Communications, which has attracted the attention of women's organizations in Shanghai. The women's organizations in Shanghai had previously sent a joint telegram to the Ministry of Communications to fight for this matter. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, some agencies of the Ministry of Communications, such as the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, have restrictions on married women's service, and the post office has also stopped female postal workers from taking the exam. Although the above restrictions have been appealed to the Ministry of Communications by women's organizations in Shanghai by telegram, there has been no result. Now that Madame Chiang has personally sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications for consideration, it is believed that the above restrictions can be expected to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Intense Infighting Among Gambling Dens</p>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, gambling activities have been rampant in Nanshi. However, the Japanese side's notifications of clubs have not yet been issued, so gangsters have privately opened gambling dens and started gambling first. The larger ones, such as the gambling den in Pinhua Lane, East Yuanmen, Chenghuang Temple, have 21 tables, including the shaking treasure, pai gow, and three dice games, with winnings and losses of thousands of yuan. Later, the boss opened it in the name of Li Xiaoshi, a big gang boss. The smaller ones, such as the Yong-style bronze treasure table in Ji畝地, have a capital of only 500 yuan. There is also a shishi stall with a capital of less than 1,000 yuan, organized by small gangsters Zhang Jiaorong, Xiao Heitan, and Xiao Afu. The large gambling dens in Xinbeimen and Erxing, which are currently being prepared, were dissatisfied with the early start of these small gambling dens. The large gambling den in Pinhua Lane is also engaged in intense infighting with these small gambling dens. Therefore, yesterday, the so-called "police station" special commissioner arrested the bronze treasure gambling den in Ji畝地, and dozens of gamblers were arrested.</p>

<p>Although the weather in Shanghai has been warm recently, many corpses are still found on the streets. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at Pushen Villa, nearly 558 corpses have been found on the streets in the past five days, including 72 large and 67 small on the 13th, 46 large and 77 small on the 14th, 37 large and 41 small on the 15th, 39 large and 84 small on the 16th, and 34 large and 61 small on the 17th. A staff member of the hall told the Datong News Agency that many of the corpses currently found on the road are those who died of starvation because the prices in Shanghai are soaring endlessly, and it is difficult for ordinary people to make a living. Refugees and beggars are at risk of starvation. Some are addicted to drugs and unable to support themselves, and died on the road. Others died of freezing or illness.</p>

<p>It is rumored that Nanshi will re-divide the safety zone starting from March 1, with the area along Lujiabang Road from Xieqiao to Xuejiabang as the boundary. The south of the road will be the garrison alert area, and the north of the road will be the safety zone. After the demarcation, entering and exiting the concession will be like the Zhabei area, without the need for a "citizen certificate." The original Japanese troops will move to the old site of the Lujiabang Xinlu Village Bookstore. However, there is no confirmed report on this statement.</p>

<p>At around 4:15 p.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Park Road in the Public Concession, a No. 3 tram was heading east when it met a No. 10 bus heading west. Neither was able to avoid the other because the city buildings protruded at that location and the road had not yet been widened. As a result, the No. 10 bus grazed the side of the No. 3 tram, causing the outer metal skin of the No. 3 tram's engine to be dented. They stopped each other, preventing traffic from passing, resulting in a 20-minute traffic jam. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<p>The police authorities of both concessions, in order to strengthen the curfew and maintain public order, have strictly enforced the curfew measures since yesterday. Those who could pass through at 3 a.m. on weekdays are now not allowed to do so under any circumstances. Traffic is only allowed freely after 4:30 a.m. Therefore, recently, there have been cases of people who were unaware of the situation violating the curfew and being detained by the police station and released after the curfew period. It is also understood that some people holding curfew passes from the Public Concession are stopped by the Russian-Vietnamese police when passing through the French Concession and treated the same as those without passes, and taken to the police station. However, the Public Concession's passes have always been recognized by the French Concession, and there is no ban, so the public hopes that the French authorities will make a clear statement on whether they can still be used to avoid violating the curfew.</p>

<h3 id="e86">How to Suppress Prices? <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>This publication previously held a symposium on the issue of prices, and the profound discussions and grand proposals were widely noticed by all sectors of society. It is a pity that although there were concrete measures, they could not be effectively implemented, which is regrettable! Recently, the exchange rate has shrunk, and the trend of hoarding and speculation has become more intense, and prices have continued to rise, especially for necessities such as rice and coal. Not only has this caused problems for the salaried class, but even the general business community who have made a fortune from the national crisis may find it difficult to sustain themselves. This is truly a serious problem for the current society! In my opinion, the following methods should be adopted to suppress prices now in order to alleviate the immediate crisis:</p>
<p>(1) It is recommended that the central government allow those who purchase imported rice and coal and other necessities to settle foreign exchange at the exchange rate of seven pence per dollar quoted by the Chongqing Central Trust of China.</p>
<p>(2) It is recommended that the central government quickly order the Shanghai banking industry to notify all those who have mortgaged goods to purchase rice and coal and other necessities.</p>
<p>(3) It is recommended that the central government quickly order the Shanghai court to investigate and deal strictly with those who hoard and speculate in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Regardless of the extent to which the above points can be implemented in reality, some measures are sufficient to warn unscrupulous merchants and reassure the people.</p>
<p>(4) Announce the names of unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate in newspapers so that they are subject to public opinion.</p>
<p>(5) Daily necessities such as rice and coal should be purchased collectively by various public groups and associations in conjunction with the Public Works Department, and stored in appropriate quantities. If funds are needed, they should be provided by the banking industry.</p>
<p>In short, although rising prices are a common phenomenon during wartime, a careful observation of the reasons for the rising prices in Shanghai and the severity of the rate of increase reveals that they are indeed manipulated by hoarders and speculators. There is no doubt that on the one hand, we should consider collective purchase of necessities, and on the other hand, we should also use the various methods mentioned above to make hoarders and speculators aware of the warning, and prices can be slightly suppressed! Otherwise, not only will it affect the increase in prices in the rear, but it will also be enough to cause problems for local public order. It is not just a matter of making the rich richer and the poor poorer. Readers should not dismiss these words as nonsense! (29, 2, 14)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Japan's Trade Surrounded on All Sides <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Zhi</p>
<p>The Sound of Being Surrounded on All Sides - The Japanese financial clique government is exhausting all means to maintain the import of raw materials and military supplies. But everything has failed. European and American countries declared to them at the beginning of the Japanese invasion of China, "No cash, no supply!" Japan frantically shouted to revitalize exports, but the raw materials for export industries also need to be purchased with cash. Its means of production (machines, raw materials, fuel) and productivity (labor, power, capital) have also been seized by the military industry. Increasing production is impossible, so how can exports increase? So at first, they sent all their cash reserves, and after exhausting all means, they had to use the issuance reserves. The Japanese yen has long become a paper currency standard. So they had to sing the high tune of revitalizing exports again. But is it useful? According to the investigation by its Ministry of Commerce and Industry: its production index reached its peak in March of last year and then began to decline sharply. The manufacturing industry production index decreased sharply from 191.3% in March of last year to 173.2% in September; mining production also decreased sharply from 175.2% to 155%. Heavy industry decreased from 358.1% to 314.2%; electricity decreased from 193.9% to 173.7%; gas decreased from 160.8% to 136.5%; the overall index decreased from 189.3% to 171%. The production increase policy has completely failed, and export capacity has also failed. Desperate, they had to intensify their plunder of China; even depriving its people of their food and clothing. But the trade deficit with third countries last year still reached more than 460 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Now: labor shortages, financial shortages, and raw material shortages are all intensifying; fuel shortages and food shortages are particularly serious. Moreover, the United States is preparing to further implement a policy of embargoing arms to Japan after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Following this, the Franco-Japanese commercial treaty will also expire. Japan's trade environment is not only as bad as it is for the United States and France, but it is also in an extremely bad state for Britain, India, Australia, the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy. The significance of this is not only to illustrate his isolated international status; more importantly, it is to point out that his economic power is rapidly collapsing; and to point out to European and American countries that "the time to implement economic sanctions against Japan" has matured. At the same time, it is also the prelude to the exhaustion of his war materials. Here, let's give a brief explanation of his trade environment!</p>
<p>No Treaty Status with the United States - In July last year, the U.S. Congress was enthusiastically discussing amending the Neutrality Act and dreaming of the Dreyfus Act; the White House resolutely revoked the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. This was a sign that it had already decided to implement a ban on arms exports to Japan, and it was also used as preparation for implementing this policy. The U.S.-Japan commercial treaty expired on January 26 of this year; the two countries have entered a state of no treaty. The arms embargo against Japan has been put on the agenda; Japan's means of threats and inducements will never change America's determination. The loan bill to China has been passed by the Senate, which is another manifestation of the United States' economic sanctions against Japan and its assistance to China's resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>The United States is not only the main source of the arms and raw materials that Japan needs, but also has become the only source since the outbreak of the European War. At the same time, it is also the largest market for Japan to obtain export foreign exchange. Therefore, the beginning of the no-treaty status between the U.S. and Japan can be said to be the beginning of the severance of the supply of Japan's war economic power.</p>
<p>Franco-Japanese Commercial Treaty About to Expire - The Franco-Japanese commercial treaty signed on March 15 last year has a validity period of only one year; it will expire on the 15th of next month. Last year, Japan made a lot of profit from doing business in France and its colonies; its trade surplus reached more than one million pounds; and it purchased a large amount of military materials from France, a large amount of industrial salt from Tunisia, and a large amount of rubber and coal from Annam. These are all necessary materials for Japan's war. Japan is now trying to renew its contract with France, but France is ignoring it.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why France is unwilling to renew the commercial treaty with Japan. Politically, it is not only because it sympathizes with China's war of resistance; it will not forget that after the treaty was signed last year, Japan brutally promoted anti-British and anti-French movements in the Tianjin area, and it is still intensifying. Moreover, according to the agreement between France and Japan in 1907, both parties should help each other to ensure the peace and security of the Chinese region where French and Japanese territories border; but Japan is now completely disregarding this agreement; not only invading Hainan Island and its nearby Chinese territories, and engaging in military preparations for future attacks on French Indochina; but also repeatedly bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway built by French capital. Therefore, the expiration of the Franco-Japanese commercial treaty is an opportunity for France to implement economic retaliation, how can it let it go lightly? Moreover, from an economic point of view; most of the materials France supplies to Japan are necessary equipment for France's war against Germany today, while what Japan supplies to France are just non-essential or even luxury goods such as salmon, pottery, and silk fabrics. In France today during wartime, it is precisely afraid of the import of such items. Therefore, there is no reason to renew the contract with Japan.</p>
<p>The Long-Abnormal Anglo-Japanese Trade - After the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry negotiations in 1934, the trade relations between Britain and Japan have long been abnormal. From the British point of view: there is no need to maintain trade with Japan. Because Japan's exports to the UK are mainly canned food, cotton silk fabrics, porcelain pottery, etc.; these all conflict with British industry. In the UK's trade with third countries, Japan accounts for only one to two percent. And it shows a constant trade deficit. But from the Japanese point of view; the relationship is extremely important. Japan's exports to the UK account for about 23.2% of total exports; imports from the UK account for about 22.8% of total imports. The main items imported from the UK are caustic soda, fuel, leather, animal hair, cotton and linen fibers and other raw materials. After Japan instigated the anti-British movement last summer, Britain considered means of economic retaliation against Japan. But Britain's actions still do not abandon its gentlemanly demeanor; although it has not formally implemented it on the surface, it has actually stopped maintaining trade relations with Japan. For example, in last year's total Japanese exports, Britain's position has dropped to 3.7%; in Japan's total imports, Britain's position has dropped to 0.9%.</p>
<p>Indo-Japanese Talks Completely Broken - India is the main market for Japanese cotton silk fabrics. At the same time, it is the main supplier of minerals such as iron and lead, and raw materials such as cotton, plant fibers, beans, and oil residues. Japan's exports of cotton fabrics to India not only hit the interests of the British Empire, but also harm the growth of India's emerging cotton spinning industry. Therefore, the Indo-Japanese cotton industry talks break down every time they are held. On November 10 last year, the third round of talks between India and Japan began again. At the beginning, India resolutely rejected Japan's opinions, and then launched a counterattack.</p>
<p>The demands made by Japan to India were (1) to reduce the current ad valorem tariff rate of 50% on cotton cloth imports; (2) to increase the quota for Japanese high-grade cotton cloth exports to India; (3) to revise the current cotton-cotton cloth exchange ratio system. India not only completely refused; but decided (1) never to reduce taxes, and prepare to increase them; (2) not to expand the import quota for high-grade Japanese cotton cloth, and plan to reduce it even further; (3) under the principle of not hindering the Indian cotton industry, it is okay to sell excess cotton to Japan. In this way, the Indo-Japanese talks completely broke down, and there is no possibility of reopening them to this day.</p>
<p>Australia's Economic Break with Japan - Japan needs a lot of wool, wheat, leather, lead, tin, etc. from Australia. However, Australia's thirst for industrial production materials from South Africa cannot be compensated by Japan. The cotton fabrics and canned food supplied by Japan are exactly the industries that Australia wants to operate on its own. Therefore, the Australian Labor Party has always been the vanguard of anti-Japanese sentiment. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Australia launched an informal economic break with Japan. With the exposure of Japan's southward advance conspiracy today, this movement is expanding more actively.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Ignores Japan's Demands - Although the Soviet Union is currently pursuing multi-faceted diplomacy, its relationship with Japan has always deteriorated. Recently, although there is a Japanese-Soviet fisheries agreement, it is only the result of Japan's submission to the Soviet Union. To obtain this agreement, Japan had to repay the Soviet Union all the money for purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway. There are hundreds of pending disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union, and the issue of trade is one of them. Until now, there is no formal commercial treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. However, the minerals, oil, timber, fur, etc. that Japan needs can be fully supplied by the Soviet Union. Around January 10 of this year, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo led Minister Songshima to Moscow, attempting to discuss this issue with the Soviet Union's People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, but the Soviet Union just ignored him.</p>
<p>The Nominal German-Japanese Commercial Treaty - Germany hastily concluded a commercial treaty with Japan last year. This is just a diplomatic gesture of Germany, with empty promises and no real benefit. Especially since the invasion of Poland expanded into the European War, Germany's foreign trade routes have been completely blocked by the British and French navies. Although Japan wants to collude with Germany through Soviet territory, Germany has no ability to supply Japan's military needs, and the Soviet Union is definitely unwilling to provide this convenient gateway. In the past, Japan obtained 40% to 50% of the machinery it needed from the United States; 25% to 30% from Germany; and 5% to 20% from Britain. Now that the U.S. and Japan have entered a state of no treaty, Britain and Germany are both unable to take care of themselves. The hope of obtaining supplies from overseas has been completely cut off so far.</p>
<p>Fundamentally Hostile Italo-Japanese Trade - Germany, as an international pariah, has always been at odds with Japan. Although the Italo-Japanese commercial agreement was signed in July of the year before last, it cannot help Japan's war economy at all. Both countries rely on the import of production materials and use light industrial products as their main exports. Therefore, in silk and silk fabrics, rayon and rayon fabrics, etc., they are in a hostile position in the world market. Having something in common is the main factor in promoting international trade relations, but it does not exist at all between Italy and Japan.</p>
<p>Concluding Remarks - In short: Japan's goods have no way out in the world market; the supply doors for the war materials and raw materials Japan needs are closing one by one. Its policy of aggression is backfiring. Therefore, hoping that the Japanese financial clique will repent is absolutely impossible. The only way to ensure the independent and free survival of the Chinese nation is to resolutely resist to the end; the only way to ensure the rights and interests of Europe and the United States is to provide economic aid to China and implement sanctions against Japan. Japan's trade environment has now fallen into a state of being surrounded on all sides, and Japan's war economy can be said to have reached the end of its rope.</p>

<p>U.S. Relations with Japan</p>
<p>For fifty years, the United States has been deeply concerned about Far Eastern affairs, such as the convening of the Washington Conference in 1922; the Stimson Doctrine promoted by the United States after the "September 18th Incident"; and even more so since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty on January 26 of this year can be said to be a manifestation of the United States' proactive Far Eastern policy.</p>
<p>The purpose of the United States in abolishing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is of course to maintain its interests in the Far East. Considering its past policies, it was the Open Door Policy. But today's situation in the Far East is no longer what it used to be. The Open Door Policy is in danger of being destroyed by the Japanese. How can the United States, in its current environment, take a listening attitude? The abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is therefore the first step in the United States' proactive containment of Japan.</p>
<p>Reasons for Abolishing the Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>U.S. trade with Japan has consistently accounted for more than 40% of its total trade with the Far East; Japan exchanges silk and tea for U.S. cotton, steel, oil, etc., and in recent years the United States has had a huge trade surplus with Japan. So why did the United States abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty? Without discussing the various political issues involved; in terms of economics, the main points that can be mentioned are as follows.</p>
<p>Today, most of China's market has been monopolized by the Japanese; Japan seizes China's rich raw materials, preventing them from being supplied to U.S. industrial needs; at the same time, it prevents U.S. surplus goods from being able to gain a foothold in the Chinese market. In the years before the war, the speed of increase in the trade volume between China and the United States was unmatched by other countries. The Americans cannot sit idly by and watch the Japanese rampage like this.</p>
<p>U.S.-Japan trade is very large and increases annually. However, what has increased is only military supplies. Since the outbreak of the European War, the U.S. military industry does not have to worry about finding a way out. In addition, the largest export to Japan is cotton, etc., but it has decreased a lot in recent years. There is also a plan to use as much Chinese cotton as possible to replace U.S. cotton. Therefore, the maintenance of U.S.-Japan trade is actually no longer profitable for the United States.</p>
<p>The United States has invested huge amounts of capital in the Far East, and after many years of operation, it has achieved its current position. However, under the wide-ranging destruction of the Japanese today, the businesses run by Americans have been greatly threatened. How can the Americans endure it?</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. Trade Relations</p>
<p>The abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has a great relationship with China. Sino-U.S. trade has developed very rapidly in recent years. And there is an annual trade surplus. In today's wartime, although trade with the United States has decreased a lot, it still occupies an important position. The following is a record of the total trade volume between China and the United States in the most recent five years: (unit: thousands of yuan)</p>
<p>Exports to the United States Imports from the United States</p>
<p>Year 24 136,467 173,731</p>
<p>Year 25 186,321 185,522</p>
<p>Year 26 231,449 188,859</p>
<p>Year 27 86,853 151,154</p>
<p>Year 28 15,675 199,670</p>
<p>(Note) The total import and export volume for Year 28 is only from January to October.</p>
<p>China's exports to the United States are mainly tung oil, raw silk, eggs, and pig bristles. These are all major raw materials for American industry. Since the outbreak of the European War last fall, exports to the United States have increased sharply, and it is expected to restore the pre-war state, or even surpass it. As for the goods imported from the United States, machinery and minerals are the most important. Because our country needs a large amount of such goods in this war of resistance and nation-building, there is hope for a sharp increase in the future. As for cotton, because most of the domestic production has been seized, the Chinese and foreign yarn factories in Shanghai have to rely on foreign cotton, so the import of U.S. cotton is also increasing.</p>
<p>U.S. Investment in China</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's estimate in 1935, U.S. investment in China was US$132 million. According to the U.S. Secretary of State Hull's estimate on January 10, 1938, it was US$240 million. Most of it is direct investment; securities investment is very small. According to Romer's estimate, in 1932, 32% of U.S. direct investment in China was in import and export businesses; 23% was in public utilities, including Shanghai's electricity company and telephone company; 17% was in banking and financial businesses, such as Citibank, Chase, and American Express; its activities were limited to trade-related finance in major commercial ports; 14% was in manufacturing, such as the cigarette industry, egg product manufacturing, and blanket industry; 7% was in transportation; 6% was in real estate; and 1% was in mining. Two-thirds of it is concentrated in Shanghai, and most of the rest is concentrated in Tianjin. Recently, in the field of aviation, American investment has greatly developed. For example, the China National Aviation Corporation, jointly operated by Pan American Airways and China. In November 1936, it extended the Pacific transoceanic route to complete the Sino-U.S. air link. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China has also sold all the properties of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in coastal ports to American merchants. But in general, the United States' investment in China is most substantial in cultural investment; the total amount of cultural investment is four times that of Britain, twice that of France, and 30 times that of Japan. Schools and hospitals run by old and new missions and American consortia are located throughout the country. The expenses of the churches in China amount to as much as US$6.4 million per year.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. Monetary Agreement and Loan Relations</p>
<p>Starting in June 1934, the United States purchased large amounts of silver, so China's silver flowed out continuously, causing an unprecedented financial panic. China then implemented the legal tender policy on November 4, 1935, centralizing silver and purchasing it as state-owned. In order to stabilize the exchange rate of the legal tender, our authorities sold 50 million taels of silver to the United States at a price of US$0.65 per tael through the Central Bank. In February 1936, China purchased US$10 million worth of gold from the United States and deposited it in the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. The Sino-U.S. Monetary Agreement was signed on May 18. In July 1937, the Sino-U.S. Monetary Agreement was signed for the second time. In today's wartime, the United States continues to purchase our silver. This move has greatly helped the promotion of our country's legal tender policy, so the Sino-U.S. relationship has become closer due to the monetary agreement.</p>
<p>The new loans from the United States to our government were only cotton and wheat loans before the war. During the war, we were loaned another 25 million yuan; according to recent reports, a new loan agreement has been established between China and the United States, and this action is actually a powerful assistance from the United States to enhance our war of resistance.</p>
<p>The United States first purchased our silver to stabilize the exchange rate of our legal tender; then loaned us huge sums of money to enhance our combat strength. Therefore, China and the United States have moved from being close to cooperation, jointly seeking peace in the Far East. The Americans deeply know that if our country wins, the United States' interests in the Far East can be preserved; otherwise, it will be driven out. Therefore, when our country is in difficulty, the Americans will do their best to help.</p>
<p>Since the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty was abolished, the United States' relationship with the Far East has entered a new stage. Japan's economic difficulties have become even more severe as a result.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Wang Dan Kui Advocates Cherishing Rice <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Qingmu, styled Dan Kui, was a native of Chongming and a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) of the former Qing Dynasty, who served as a Lianfang (an official responsible for investigating and rectifying misconduct) and was admired by all for his integrity and fairness. At the age of eighty-one, his spirit was even more vigorous than ever. In view of the recent high price of rice in Shanghai, which was unprecedented, he earnestly advised people to cherish rice, as it concerns one of the four major elements of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, what Mr. Wang said is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guanzi said, "The five grains are the people's lifeblood." He also said, "Of all things, the five grains are the most important." In ancient times, wise rulers valued the five grains over pearls and jade, which was passed down as a beautiful tale. Today, people treasure and hide a single hook of gold, yet they carelessly waste grains of rice, forgetting what they should value. Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather, and the population is dense. Charitable people print and distribute good books, some of which include discussions on cherishing grain, but society does not pay much attention. The waste in restaurants and bars is beyond description, and even among the thousands of households, many arbitrarily discard rice. In the past, when the price of rice was low, people did not know to cherish it, and this became a habit. In the early years of the Guangxu reign, a stone of rice cost two thousand cash, but now it costs as much as fifty yuan per stone, with one yuan equal to three thousand cash, totaling one hundred and fifty thousand cash, which is seventy-five times higher. Cherishing rice should be done regardless of whether it is cheap or expensive; it should be cherished when it is cheap, and even more so when it is expensive. Why not pay attention to this and violate the ancient saying of treasuring grains of rice? A certain prime minister of the Song Dynasty, who sought power and accepted bribes, held sway both at home and abroad. His household had over a thousand people, who were tired of rich food. The kitchen happened to be next to a Buddhist monastery, and every day rice flowed into the ditch, looking like jade grains and pearl beads. The monks of the monastery, along with their novices, used bamboo baskets to scoop it up, wash it clean, and dry it in the sun. Besides feeding the monks, they accumulated thirteen storage bins. Later, the prime minister was found guilty and defeated, and his family members scattered. His widowed mother, over eighty years old, wandered to the capital, begging along the streets. One day, she arrived in front of the mountain gate of the monastery. The monk saw her, knew that she was the mother of the prime minister, and could not help but sigh. He then allocated a room for her to live in, and she ate with the monks at every meal, the rice being cooked from the dried rice in the storage bins. The mother soon fell ill and died, and was buried in a worn mat. Reflecting on this, I am deeply moved. The virtue of a child is the responsibility of the mother. In the "Family" hexagram of the Book of Changes, the woman is in charge of the food. The mother of the prime minister failed to educate her son and neglected her duties in managing the food, which led to the neglect of cherishing grain as the main cause of ruin. The tragic result is heartbreaking; shouldn't this be taken as a warning? The people of this country have always lacked research on diet and hygiene, so stomach diseases are particularly common. When eating rice, people neglect to chew properly, and after it enters the stomach, the nutrition is insufficient, easily leading to stagnation. Tao Yinjun's poem says, "When eating, avoid being too coarse and too fast; it is better to eat smaller meals in succession than to fill the stomach at once, as it harms the qi and injures the spleen." This is an excellent method of eating. School dining hall rules include the four words "chew slowly and swallow slowly," which shows genuine care for the students. Generally speaking, eating a bowl of rice that is chewed carefully is better than eating two bowls of rice swallowed whole. This is because rice that is chewed carefully is rich in nourishment and easy to digest, so it is beneficial to the human body, while rice swallowed whole is the opposite. Only those who pay attention to hygiene can distinguish this. Reducing the waste of rice at home, accumulating day by day, can save a lot. This is also a way to cherish rice. Madam Ouyang, the wife of Zeng Wenzhenggong, ascended to immortality after her death and was known as Fairy Ouyang. She once descended to the altar to instruct women to cherish the five grains, and attached a poem saying, "The world's customs are declining, alas, today; who still cherishes the five grains? I advise you women to be vigilant, lest you accumulate sins and bring disaster." Therefore, I especially address women. Today, the people of this country are suffering an unprecedented catastrophe. How should we cleanse our hearts and minds to reach the heavens? Cherishing rice is not just about saving money, but also about saving us from the catastrophe. May my compatriots have a sudden awakening at dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e95">A Week's Economical Menu <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the lunar new year, prices have soared. Each stone of foreign rice now costs fifty yuan, and Du rice even exceeds this number. The seven necessities of life have all increased dramatically, causing housewives to shake their heads and frown, truly suffering from the hardship of making ends meet. A year ago, this economical menu would have cost six or seven jiao (cents) and been enough for two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes. Now, it costs more than one yuan, which is really too difficult. The other day, my family ate a very ordinary dish of stir-fried chives and bean curd sheets with shredded pork, which cost a huge seven jiao. The children still didn't eat their fill, and the housewife didn't dare to pick up her chopsticks. Alas, only those black-hearted hoarders and profiteers who speculate and get rich don't care about this level of living, while the rest of us who rely on salaries to live should just wait to die. Since "increasing income" is impossible, we can only start with "reducing expenditure." Every day, we must choose inexpensive ingredients for two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes. If that is beyond our means, then eat one meat dish and two vegetarian dishes, or one meat dish and one vegetarian dish; please use your own discretion. At the same time, save on rice by having one rice meal and two porridge meals each day, and eat only enough to satisfy your hunger. In this time of living death, we can only tighten our belts and live one day at a time.</p>

<h3 id="e96">How to Protect Socks <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Bing</p>
<p>Although socks are a small item, if we are not careful in wearing them, the cost of socks in a year can be considerable.</p>
<p>So how should we protect them to make them last longer?</p>
<p>In addition to paying attention to whether there are any holes when buying them, the most important thing is to be careful ourselves. If there is a hole, we should immediately sew it up or attach a sock bottom. The sock toes and heels are the most prone to damage, because these are the areas where the foot exerts the most force when walking. However, as long as we are a little lazy, then, "A small hole not mended will lead to a big hole that causes suffering." A small hole will gradually spread to the entire sock, thereby reducing the sock's lifespan.</p>
<p>People with sweaty feet tend to wear out socks more often than people with less sweaty feet, simply because socks are easily damaged when they get wet. It's best to make a pair of cloth sock liners to wear inside the socks. I think that way, the number of socks used will definitely be reduced.</p>
<p>Washing socks frequently is also the best way to protect them, not only making them last longer, but also meeting hygiene requirements. However, many people mistakenly believe that washing them frequently will easily damage them. However, when washing them, do not use a brush to scrub them; rub them gently.</p>
<p>At a time when white goods are expensive, we should do our best to protect the socks we wear, so as to reduce the amount we need to wear.</p>

<h3 id="e97">(1) Stewed Four Happiness Meat (also known as Dongpo Pork) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Ingredients: One pound of streaky pork belly with three layers, five fen (1 fen = 0.1 ounce) of salt, a little monosodium glutamate (MSG), 1.3 liang (1 liang = 1.76 oz) of light soy sauce, six liang of Shaoxing wine, a large pot of natural water, 3-4 liang of rock sugar, one iron fork for grilling, one earthenware pot, a dozen pieces of broken porcelain, one yellow basket lid, one charcoal stove, several pounds of charcoal, one large stewing pot for stewing the meat.</p>
<p>Preparation: First, remove the hair from the pork, wash it clean, and cut it into two-inch squares. Then, put the oil, wine, etc., all into the large stewing pot. Then, rub the salt all over the pork. Use an iron fork to hold the pork over the charcoal fire until both sides turn yellow. Take it out and then place the porcelain pieces into the large stewing pot. Add the yellow basket lid and place the pork on top of the yellow basket lid. Stew it over the charcoal fire. After stewing it for forty or fifty boils, add six liang of Shaoxing wine. Wait for more than a hundred boils before adding natural water. The amount of water should cover the surface of the meat by more than two inches. After stewing until the pork skin turns red, add the rock sugar and stew for another three-quarters of an hour. Then, turn the meat over, add a little MSG, and stew for another three-quarters of an hour or so. Turn it over again, and so on, turning it over four or five times in a row until the meat flavor comes out and the pork skin is crispy.</p>
<p>When serving, the taste is endlessly delicious. Note: This recipe will be published every Monday in the "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation" section. Readers are encouraged to collect them on schedule so that they can become a valuable recipe book in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Lantern Festival Food <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival can be said to be the continuation of the Lunar New Year celebrations, and it is also the tail end of the Lunar New Year. Eating and entertainment are the most exciting parts of the New Year, and the Lantern Festival is no different. There is a saying: "Eat tangyuan (glutinous rice balls) at the beginning of the Lantern Festival, and eat rice cake at the end. Celebrate the Lantern Festival on the fifteenth of the first month." In the past, during peaceful times, setting up lanterns on the Yuan night (Lantern Festival) was the most organized and lively, as in the saying: "The golden crow is not forbidden, the city opens and does not sleep," but such joy can only be found in books now. In these days of serious national crisis, it is naturally out of the question. However, on this isolated island, perhaps there are still people who are perfunctorily going through the motions to embellish this good night.</p>
<p>According to Hangzhou custom, the thirteenth day of the first month is the Shangdeng (first lighting of the lanterns), and the seventeenth is the Luodeng (closing of the lanterns). As for other places, the twelfth is the Shangdeng, and the eighteenth is the Luodeng. This is due to different local customs. In addition to lantern competitions, there are seasonal foods for the Lantern Festival. The so-called Shangdeng tangyuan (also known as lantern tangyuan) is made by grinding glutinous rice into flour, mixing it with water, and making small balls the size of lotus seeds. They are cooked in boiling water until they are done, and then sprinkled with osmanthus sugar juice, making them fragrant and delicious. I remember that the poet Chen Xuyuan had a verse about tangyuan, saying: "After all, the daughters' hands are nimble, rouge and powder are used to make lantern tangyuan," what a beautiful and elegant verse! After the Shangdeng, there is the Yuanxiao (Lantern Festival), and there is also a kind of food called Yuanxiao, which is also made of rice flour and is the size of walnuts, with various fillings inside, such as red bean paste, white sugar, peach meat, and melon seeds. However, this product made in Beiping (Beijing) is the most famous, so the market often uses Beiping Yuanxiao as a selling point. By the time of the Luodeng, the festival ends with eating rice cake. The various foods listed above are all cooked in the family during the Shangdeng time each day, first offered to the ancestors, and then eaten together by the family, thus ending the eating part of the Lunar New Year.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Chinese Cabbage <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jingren</p>
<p>Chinese cabbage is also called song. Lu Dian's "Pi Ya" says that it wilts late in the winter and is often seen with a green stalk, so it is called song. Li Shizhen said that there are two types, one with a round stalk, slightly green and thick, and one with a white stalk, thin and flat, which is what is commonly seen in kitchens today. As for the yellow bud cabbage, it is also a variation of Chinese cabbage, especially because it is produced in different places, grown differently, and has different soil qualities, so its properties and tastes are also different. As for its effects, according to various herbal books, it is warm in nature, sweet in taste, non-toxic, promotes intestinal movement, relieves worries, harmonizes the middle and lowers the qi, helps digestion, relieves alcohol, treats miasma, and stops hot coughs. It is especially good for winter sweating, because after frost, its nature turns cool and its taste becomes sweeter. Therefore, mashing raw cabbage can treat sores and poison, and using the juice to focus on the eyes can remove pterygium. Western medicine uses it to make ointments as a soothing and calming agent, saying that its effects can replace opium, and it can also induce perspiration, promote urination, and cause mild diarrhea. When taken with maritime onion and foxglove, it can treat bloating. Its seeds can be squeezed for oil, which can grow hair and prevent rust when applied to knives and swords, so the gun oil used by the military is cabbage seed oil. However, "Rihua Zhujia Bencao" says that it is cool in nature and slightly poisonous, and eating too much can cause skin itching. However, people today use it as a common food, and this has never been seen. Generally, what Rihua refers to is the yellow bud cabbage, a variation of Chinese cabbage. Because it is grown in sandy soil, its properties are different from those grown in clay soil. Li Shizhen said: "Yellow bud cabbage is cultivated by northerners using horse manure, imitating the method of growing yellow chives." So, the ancient saying "early chives in early spring, late song in late autumn" refers to the secret of growing variations of crops, not the common crops in general. Horse manure contains nitrates, which have the unique property of rising and permeating. It is the same as the ammonium nitrate in imported fertilizers, so it can help the stems and leaves grow and become fully enlarged. The "Rihua Zi" says that it can cause skin wind, which is due to this reason. Therefore, I believe that those who are sensitive to irritating foods should avoid yellow bud cabbage, not Chinese cabbage. In terms of nourishment, those with more protein are considered valuable. Protein is nitrate, and ammonia is composed of nitrate and hydrogen, so yellow bud cabbage is more potent than Chinese cabbage. People with pale faces and thin bodies are caused by a lack of protein-containing foods, hence the saying "a face with cabbage color." Southerners are weaker than northerners, and even the meat color on the faces of the poor can be used to distinguish this, probably because the vegetables they eat are different. The nourishing power of cabbage seed oil and soybean oil can also be used to distinguish them. Those in charge of the food should pay close attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Connection Between Clothes and Wives <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Shusen</p>
<p>Everyone knows that clothes are what everyone needs to wear and cannot be separated from the body; and wives are what everyone needs to have, as "Of the three unfilial acts, having no descendants is the greatest." However, these are fundamentally two different things that are completely unrelated.</p>
<p>However, people in ancient times often liked to mention these two things together, as if they had a related relationship. Of course, if we seriously examine this, there must be many examples. Here, I will only cite a few of the most popular and common ones to prove this.</p>
<p>Those who have read the Romance of the Three Kingdoms probably remember that Mr. Liu once said: "Wives are like clothes, brothers are like limbs." The metaphor is wonderful and quite interesting. Unfortunately, his following two sentences: "Clothes that are torn can still be mended; limbs that are broken cannot be reconnected," although are his words of loyalty and righteousness, are a bit too dismissive of wives, aren't they?</p>
<p>The above passage is just a metaphor and does not directly establish any related relationship. Like in the Peking opera "Wujia Po," there is a duet between Wang Baochuan and her husband Xue Pinggui: "I asked him... if his clothes were torn?" Besides inquiring about her husband's diet and living conditions, she is also concerned about her husband's clothes. This clearly tells people that it is a wife's duty to care about her husband.</p>
<p>In fact, when a man marries a wife, his purpose is not solely for the problem of clothes; but many people always use the big issue of clothes as a guise to cover up his unspeakable shame. It is both dignified and grand, and can be considered the ultimate in speaking skills.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, you can walk to any road or any street corner, and you will always hear a plaintive song: "Wang Laowu, Wang Laowu... lived for thirty-five years in vain, no one mends his torn clothes!..." This song is Wang Laowu expressing his inner suffering. Someone said: "If you haven't married, just say it straightforwardly. Why beat around the bush and say that your clothes are torn and no one mends them? Moreover, there are many issues concerning wives, so why specifically mention clothes?" This is based on what? I, the author, am not smart enough and await the guidance of someone more enlightened!</p>
<p>Finally, I recall an interesting and funny story that I heard in my childhood. Now, I will write it here, both for the readers to laugh at and as the conclusion to this article. It is said that there was once the son of a poor scholar who was nearing the age of thirty and had not yet married, and he was quite dissatisfied with his father. One day, he came up with a wild idea and wrote two five-character lines of poetry in a place that his father passed by every day: "At the age of twenty-five, clothes are torn and no one mends." Sure enough, the next day there was a response: "If you want someone to mend your clothes, wait another twenty-five!" He almost burst his stomach with anger. He immediately picked up his pen and wrote two seven-character lines of poetry: "It is rare for people to live to seventy in ancient times, who marries a wife at fifty?" He was confident and reasoned powerfully in this rebuttal, thinking that he would definitely achieve the final victory. Little did he know that his father was determined and lightly replied with two lines: "Taigong met King Wen at eighty, what's wrong with waiting a few more years, Father?"</p>

<h3 id="e101">A Letter from a Small Temple Keeper <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xingru</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," it is said that temples and monasteries have also experienced a "prosperous" phenomenon. When life is being crushed to the point of suffocation, seeking divination is already extremely foolish, let alone feeding a group of social parasites. Below is a letter from a small temple keeper. For those foolish women who want to ask the bodhisattva to solve their fate, please take the time to read this passage. (Editor)</p>
<p>(1) Work: Every day, work starts from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM before one can rest, for a total of fourteen hours of work. If there are Taoist ceremonies or meritorious deeds, working all night is also common. The scope of work includes all the affairs in the temple, non-stop work, and also serving the abbot in all private matters, serving in multiple roles, even worse than a slave.</p>
<p>(2) Treatment: In addition to providing food and lodging, the temple keeper's monthly salary ranges from one yuan to four or five yuan. If there are fasting ceremonies or Taoist performances, he can get some small rewards from the guests. However, if the reward exceeds one yuan, it must be handed over to the abbot, who will give back three or four jiao, and the rest will go into his own pocket.</p>
<p>(3) Meals: Although the abbot is a monk, he cultivates his mind but not his mouth. He cannot eat without chicken, meat, and fish, but his subordinates must be vegetarian and not allowed to eat meat. The abbot must have a meal of black rice in addition to white rice - a smoking habit. Such a monk is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>(4) Snobbery: In addition, he has a snobbish eye. If he sees a wealthy gentleman or a devout Buddhist coming, he will be extremely attentive and hospitable. If he encounters ordinary incense-burning guests, he will be greeted by Taoist priests. If he doesn't get much benefit, he will haggle over every penny, truly a snobbish person.</p>
<p>(5) Extortion: The means of extorting money are extremely clever and meticulous, taking tens of gold at every turn for doing good deeds. If Taoist priests are hired to chant mantras, the guests pay four yuan, but the Taoist priests only get thirty-eight cents. In addition, candle oil is also the biggest source of profit. If a guest burns incense, he is persuaded to buy large candles. As soon as the guest leaves, the candle is immediately pulled out. The market price of candle oil can sell for eighty to one hundred yuan per load. There are also various ways to extort money, with clever means, which are simply innumerable.</p>
<p>The above are all facts, witnessed and handled personally. Such monks are of no benefit to the country and only harm society. Now, I will reveal the inside story one by one, hoping that kind-hearted and sincere believers will use their useful money to help the refugees in need and not do this foolish act again.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Another Charitable Hospital <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Cheng</p>
<p>After reading the article "American Refugee Hospital" by Ruo Mengjun in the first issue of this month's magazine, I couldn't help but think of another hospital dedicated to benefiting the poor and sick.</p>
<p>This hospital is located in a Western-style house near the intersection of Wangzhi Road and Luba Road in the French Concession. There is no nameplate in front of the door. As far as I know, I heard that it is run by a German "Tong Sheng Miss", presumably a member of the church who specializes in charitable work, so people commonly call it "Tong Sheng Hospital". The hospital has two clinics, one for men and the other for women. There are more than a dozen German doctors and Chinese assistants in the hospital, all of whom are women. Here, in addition to not charging for medical expenses, the registration fee is also waived. The hospital also has both internal and surgical departments and has hospital wards.</p>
<p>The "American Refugee Hospital" is in West Shanghai, and some people may think it is inconvenient because it is far away. Then, you might as well go there, but please note: their consultation time is only in the morning, and the door is closed in the afternoon to avoid running into trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Schools Should Not Charge for "Entry and Exit Permits" <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Fufang</p>
<p>We often see in the newspapers that kidnappers mix into elementary schools, strip children of their clothes, or seduce young children and try to abduct them. For the safety of their children, most parents, regardless of the trouble, enter the school to pick up and drop off their children, either in person or by sending a servant.</p>
<p>Elementary school buildings are very small and naturally cannot accommodate these "idlers," but they cannot prevent parents from picking up and dropping off their students. And there are still irrelevant people entering and exiting, so recently many schools have issued "entry and exit permits" to restrict access.</p>
<p>The so-called "entry and exit permit" is a piece of paper card. Anyone who wants to receive it must pay between five jiao and one yuan, and a few schools say they will return it later, but most do not.</p>
<p>Amidst the rising tuition and book fees, the school authorities do not seem to be charging for "entry and exit permits". If necessary, only the cost of the permit can be charged, whether it is returned or not, as it increases the burden on parents, which is something the school authorities should pay attention to.</p>
<p>"Entry and exit permits" are a good method, but "everything costs money" is too "commercialized"!</p>
<h3 id="e104">Public Opinion Sanctions! <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>The recent surge in prices is indeed too alarming, especially for rice, flour, and coal briquettes. Not to mention that the poor who spend a few jiao a day on retail purchases cannot survive, even those who rely on meager salaries are groaning and complaining. Everything else can be saved, but rice, flour, and coal stoves cannot be avoided. It is reported that the Municipal Federation sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to quickly find ways to stabilize prices, which is indeed the most pressing need. I think that if the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Public Works Department jointly organize a price balancing association to regulate prices, the results would definitely be very significant.</p>
<p>Considering the recent surge in rice, flour, and coal briquettes, the "unsmooth supply" and "sudden increase in water fees" cannot be ignored, but the main reason is still due to the reckless actions of unscrupulous speculators, which can be seen from the advertisements of several coal briquette factories urging delivery. Therefore, I believe that in addition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Public Works Department jointly organizing a price balancing association, we must also launch "public opinion sanctions" to remedy the shortcomings of the balancing association.</p>
<p>The so-called "public opinion sanctions," as I have thought of them, include the following two, and I especially call on the editors of the newspapers to give their sympathy and support:</p>
<p>(1) The newspapers should publish as many articles as possible exposing the conspiracies of speculators.</p>
<p>(2) The editors of the newspapers (especially the supplements) should do their best to lead public opinion sanctions, set an example, and write more articles attacking or exposing speculators.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Global Communication, Universal Language, Educational Awards for Talented Children</p>
<p>Ye Songfen said, "I don't believe it! Is it really possible that the newspaper delivery person looks like Jiang Jingrong? I'll go see for myself tomorrow, and then I'll understand." Old Zhang Ma said, "Young master! You must get up earlier tomorrow and let me stop him, then you can come out and see him. If you don't stop him first, he runs so fast, you'll never catch him. He almost got away today too, luckily I chased him quickly and caught him." Upon hearing this, Ye Songfen became even more suspicious that it was Jiang Jingrong, remembering that he ran faster than him during the school's Class A race. The next day, Ye Songfen indeed got up early, wanting to see the newspaper delivery person next door. He instructed Old Zhang Ma to call him when he arrived. When Jiang Jingrong arrived at the same old time to deliver the newspaper, Old Zhang Ma, while calling her young master, said to Jiang Jingrong, "Little newspaper delivery boy! Deliver slowly! Our young master wants to say a few words to you, wait a moment;" Jiang Jingrong, upon hearing this, thought, what does he mean, his young master wants to talk to me? Isn't his young master Ye Songfen? He took off running. But Ye Songfen had already chased after him. This time, Ye Songfen ran faster than him. Why? Because Ye Songfen was empty-handed, while he was carrying a large bundle of newspapers. Ye Songfen circled around in front of him and saw that it was indeed Jiang Jingrong. He said, "Jiang Jingrong! I've caught you today! I've written you several letters, but you never replied. What's the reason for that? I guessed that you didn't go to school anymore, but why are you selling newspapers?" Jiang Jingrong's face turned red, and he lowered his head without saying a word. Ye Songfen said, "We are good friends, why didn't you tell me? If you can't afford to go to school, I can help you. I've talked to my father, and he would definitely be willing to cover your tuition. Even if my father is not willing, I still have some savings in a bank account, and I can help you. Didn't we read in our textbook the saying, 'Friends should share their wealth'? Come to my house at five o'clock this afternoon, and we'll discuss a solution, okay? Once we've discussed it, you won't have to sell newspapers anymore." Jiang Jingrong shook his head and said, "No! It's better for me to sell newspapers. It's not that I don't want to study, don't want to go to school. But my mother gave birth to three of us, and you know I have two younger sisters. Because I was studying, my two sisters were forced to not be able to study. Now that I'm not studying, my eldest sister has already entered elementary school. So, I'm very happy in my heart, and I plan to let my youngest sister also enter school. I sell newspapers to help my mother, and my mother is really too hardworking for us children." As he spoke, he couldn't help but shed tears. (239)</p>
