<h3 id="c15">日本侵華戰略的檢討 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>檢討年餘以來日方侵華戰略，當不難發現在去年秋冬之際曾經有所轉變，而侵桂之役則爲這一轉變的號誌，在那以前，日軍比較側重華中的湘鄂與華北的山西，其見之於實際行動者則有贛北鄂中湘北的幾度會戰，以及中條呂梁兩山脈間的十幾次『掃蕩』戰爭。自從十一月而後則四南戰塲實爲日方所注意的一個目標，邕寧據點的死守，邕欽鐵路的興修，以及幾度沿着左江鬱江和邕賓邕武公路的肆擾，都可證明那一方面的戰局乃爲日方憧憬的焦點。最近法越對日的屈服和日方南進企圖的急切，雖都是歐局突變所引起的後果，並非日軍開始進擾桂南時始料所及，而侵桂之役終不失爲日方戰略側重南進的一個新的起點，且替最近種種拓展野心安放了有利的基礎。</p>
<p>這一戰略的轉變是西尾坂垣來華後的產物，大體上主要是坂垣的傑作。他的口號是繼續　綫進攻，切斷中國交通路綫。他的目標是封鎖西南國際通路，但對於沿海的騷擾，浙贛湘桂路綫的破壞，粵漢路的打通，與對西北中蘇交通孔道的阻撓，凡此種種企圖，也並沒有忽略。如果今年五月襄棗之役日方目的是在侵佔老河口以便窺陝，則宜昌之役用意殆不外準備南侵常德以至湘西，而浙閩沿海的封鎖與游攻，粵北與東江的肆擾，也都含有破壞中國沿海以及腹地交通的意味。但其所最着重的仍屬桂南方面的行動、因爲日閥始終幻想西南國際通路一經切斷，則中日戰事即有解決之望；另一方面，那一軍事行動又正好與日本國內響澈雲霄的南進呼聲互爲表裏。是以日軍在桂南各方的侵擾縱一再遭受挫逆，其對於邕寗以及欽防的據點則不惜付出絕大代價來保持。這一戰略的轉變自較前此那種跳躍式的進擾以及徘徊於內侵與「掃蕩」之間的情况較勝一籌，但同時也正暴露出日方實力的竭蹶與內心的焦躁，而其所謂切斷中國交通路幾者更始終是掩飾其軍事失敗的託辭。自從中日戰事開始，中國沿海即遭日方封鎖，更復利用其絕對優勢的海軍逐漸佔領中國每一重要港口；比較起擁有强大海軍和商船的日本，中國所能運用的國際運輸能力，至多不過僅抵日方若干分之一。而日方却不惜加以極端誇張，把中國之所以不能克復的責任全部諉之於這一點微弱的國際運輸能力上面，採取這樣的藉口，似乎也並非日軍的光榮。</p>
<p>然而坂垣這一戰略企圖，也並未較比前此的日軍統帥有更多的成就。欽防與邕寗的佔領，在日方也許會引爲得意的收穫，但那旣未能取得進侵西南腹地的便利，又未能取得切斷越桂交通的實效，如果不是法國戰敗而不能對日作有力的抗拒，則切斷越南交通的願望將永不能藉日軍行動而有所成就。此外雖又侵佔一荆沙宜昌，其所消耗的實力已極可觀，而在整個戰局當中的影響仍極微渺。至於浙閩海面的封鎖與游攻，則根本即屬失敗。</p>
<p>國際局勢的逆轉固然滿足了日閥封鎖西南國際交通的宏願，但也促成了美國禁運的實施，兩相比較，究竟爲得爲失，也許只有日本當局自己纔明瞭，而越南的危機則因此而更趨緊張。從六月中旬日方提出禁運妥求的同時，桂南日軍即分途西犯，一路由邕寗進擾龍州鎭南關，一路由防城西侵進迫粵越邊境的東興，更傳日方已向法越進行假途及設置根據地的要求。上月中旬，日軍曾大舉向華中方面結集，似有再度進擾長沙或進窺常德模樣，但迄今已近一月，並未有所動作，顯係受日本政局更迭和厲行南進政策的影響。預料在最近期間，日軍可能暫時放棄其他戰塲的攻勢，以全力從事於對西南的侵擾和對越南的壓迫。這也許就是所謂『置其重心於中國事變之解決』的具體表現。此之不足以影響中日戰局，正有如前此封鎖中國之不足以削弱中國抗戰實力，目前日本所需求的是不勞而獲，而不是更大的肓動與冒險。如其眞要不顧一切而操切從事，則不管列强與法越反響如何，中國必不免實踐六月廿三日的宣言而從事於進一步的自衛行動。日軍侵入桂南已九個月，縱竭力撑持，迄今毫無重大成就，則即使其甘冒不韙，把西南戰塲更擴大到中國邊境以外，也無非分散兵力，多方樹敵，其所企求的目的依然可望而不可即；日當局此際之所自鳴得計者，到那時候，必又將自悔其孟浪失策。</p>

<p>海通社航空通訊國際馳名之德國速降轟炸機、並非在比。法作戰始露頭角、德軍出征挪威時、此種轟炸機、摧毀英國之鐵甲軍艦、已屢奏奇助矣、速降轟炸機之機構、異常精巧繁複、其成功也、非可倖致、當德國復興空軍之初、德國航空部技術司司長烏台德將軍、卽委託專家、以創造速降轟炸機之重寄、普爾曼君卽設計專員中技術指導主任之一也、</p>
<p>據普爾曼君稱、爲謀速降轟炸機之進步、有須予以特別沈意者、該機必須能裝載每枚重達四百磅之炸彈　並須於開足速率疾降時、有擊中極小目標之能力、初、製造飛機專家、認爲在上述情形之下、至多祇能載二百公斤重之炸彈耳、</p>
<p>製造森炸機者、旣以减低敵方高射砲火之威力、至最低限度爲目標、則該機降落襲擊時之速度、自以神速爲妙、但機身疾降之速率愈高、則飛機開始作速降之行動時、其距離地面之高度亦愈大、因此速降轟炸機之機構、非特別靈巧不爲功、經過若干專家之凝神苦思、經過數千小時之精密設計、始能開工製造第一架試騐機、又不知經過若干人、若干時間之工作與硏究，始能逐漸改良、精益求精、以達完善之境、當其未臻完善之前、設計者曾遭遇種種理論上與實際上之困難、幾於功虧一簣、甚至有發生疑慮、認爲成功難期者、幸當局意志堅定、不惜資本、不畏犧牲、試騐復試騐、改良復改良、消費雖大、歷時雖久、終能造成、合於理想之速降轟炸機、在飛機製造史上、開一新紀元、良堪慶幸西班牙內戰時、JU87號轟炸機、始得參戰之機會、一試其鋒、果也一鳴驚人、不同凡響、作戰之結果、昭示速降轟炸機之威力、在機構方面、已無重大修改之需要矣、</p>
<p>普氏最後聲稱、德國經過若干年試騐與犧牲、所造速降轟炸機始能獲得優越美滿之成績、他國縱能依樣葫蘆、疾起直追，獲得成就、然欲與德國速降轟炸機相頡頏，談何容易云、（王善賞譯）</p>

<p>這篇通信是美國星期六晚報Saturday　Evdning　Post駐歐特派員裴斯Demarce　Bess所作，其實係根據確實報告，說明希特勒　最後決心的經過情形，茲譯錄於後：</p>
<p>希特勒的勁旅，在比利時荷蘭境內，從天飛下之後，歐洲的所謂「滑稽戰」就一變而爲全面戰了。從去年九月到今年五月，交戰各國無不小心翼翼，審愼作戰。記者當時曾在交戰各國的前後方實地視察了好幾個月，深知交戰各國以及中立各國的軍民，對於這種死樣怪氣的滑稽戰，都有點不耐煩。詛知希特勒一鳴驚人，滑稽戰一變而爲全面戰，情况雖極可怕，但各國的士氣民氣却爲之一振。推原其故，無非是歐洲人旣然又要火併一塲，還是早些解決的痛快。</p>
<p>然而歐戰的性質，這樣突然轉變，原因何在？這種轉變是否完全發動於德國方面；若然，則希特勒是否早已準備？他是否計劃在滑稽戰八個月之後，始乃發動全面戰。或者是德國內部或外面發生了某種情事，使他變更作戰計劃的？</p>
<p>我們知道德軍參謀部對於西綫作戰計劃是早已決定好的。國社黨要人，在去年秋　戰事發動之後，曾吿訴各國訪員，說他的準備集中全力，對付英國。由今回顧，德方在八個月內的種種舉動，似乎在按照一這種方針行事。在這八個月，他們可說無時無刻不在準備全面戰爭，而這全面戰爭，畢竟在五月十日發作了，這是一種觀察。</p>
<p>但據余研究各種證據之後所得的結論，上面的一說，實屬似是而實非。余確知希特勒下令西綫總攻，是臨時通知參謀部的。參謀部對於西綫作戰計劃，固已預先精密擬定，如在其他方面作戰一樣，但據可靠報吿，他們對於何時何處發動閃電戰，直到作戰前數天始接通知。</p>
<p>四月梢，余在羅馬遇某要人，彼與德軍參謀部人員過從甚密。德軍參謀人員歷年來曾與他暢談他們的目標和希望，絕　隱飾。余在羅馬與他遇見時，曾吿訴他說，正往荷蘭採訪消息。他便很驚奇的問：「君往荷蘭何爲？那裏是不會有事的。　這層也足以　證希特勒大令西綫總攻是臨時決定的。</p>
<p>在歐洲，五月節不僅是花朝，且是歐洲的勞動節，對於歐洲在社會主義者，是一年中重要的一天。但據余所知，今年的五月節實是希特勒最後決定實行世界大賭博的一天。</p>
<p>我們還記得，聯軍　挪威中部撒退，就在五月節那天。這一行動，在德國國內，比在其他各國，更有重大的影饗。它根本上解決了開戰八月以來德國黨政軍當局不一致的爭端。國社黨極端派不顧切的「勝者獨贏」口號終於占了上風。要了解斯干的那維亞冒險行動對於德國政策的重大影響，我們應追溯到歐戰開始的最初幾天。一般人皆已承認，去年九月英法對德宣戰，是出乎德國國社黨領袖意料之外的。他們預料英法決不會爲波蘭問題而作戰的。</p>
<p>但是英法畢竟宣戰了，國社黨遂不得不重行老量其地位。希特勒亦卽召集所有顧問討論應付方策。他那時他的態度似極坦白，胸無成見，因爲他的預定計劃已爲英法出乎意料之外的行動所粉碎了。那時對希特勒所提出的忠告顯然分成兩派。一派包括陸軍將校及經濟專家，認爲德國旣獲得蘇聯的奧援，抵抗封鎖戰爭，可有勝利的把握。他們又認爲國社黨的德國，比之歐洲民主國，組織尤爲完密，適宜於長期戰爭。英法方面。對於長期的總動員，尙未組織健全，長期戰爭，將使是士氣及經濟兩者，都吿破產。不過這樣一個戰爭中，德國應保存戰爭的實力，卽使像波蘭那樣大規模軍事　攻，也不擬再有。總之，德國不應冒全面戰的危險，以達勝利的途徑。他們並謂，滑稽戰可以淆亂英法的同情各國（特別是美國）的聽聞，使他們不致加入敵方陣營。</p>
<p>這是具有充分理由的論斷，希特勒有一時期似曾受其影響。然此種論調，却爲主張全面戰爭的國社黨極端派所反對。此派相信歐洲民主國非常腐化，不値一擊，就可打倒。德國不應再事猶豫，而應立卽對英法進行全面戰爭。</p>
<p>此派對希特勒不斷進言。希特勒也是喜歡冒險的人。但在去年九月，國社黨極端派並沒有十分獲得他的寵信。他們曾向希特勒保證，說英法不會爲波蘭作戰的。結果，他們的情報證明完全不確。另一派的論斷，雖不十分中聽，却比較可靠。</p>
<p>此兩派最初勢均力敵，對於希特勒都有影響，但這時國社黨獨裁者左右爲難，並無採取那一項政策的表示。</p>
<p>據記者在羅馬所得的秘密消息，希特勒與墨索里尼在勃倫納山隘會晤前兩天，他始決心　　干的那維亞有所行動。他條置那次會議，志在把他所頂備約計劃通知墨索里尼，並請求他在地中海方面，也來一個轉移目標的牽制行動。墨索里尼接受了這種主張，玩弄得非常巧妙，除開羅馬幾個目光尖銳的居民外，所有的人都被他朦混了。</p>
<p>斯干的那維亞的戰事，因此成爲德國兩派戰略消畏的最後試騐。如果國社黨對挪威的軍事行動失敗，滑稽戰無疑的要繼續延長。但進攻挪威居然獲得了空前的勝利，國社黨極端派在柏林便占了優勢。希特勒見風轉舵，便立卽在他處進行全面戰爭，這是確定不移的事實。</p>
<p>挪威的佔領也使義大利改變了一切態度，正如歐洲其他部分一樣。法西斯獨裁者墨索里尼聽到德國進攻挪威成功之後，便完全改變了他的政治地位。這就是講，他曉得滑稽戰已成過去，代之而興的便是全面戰。唯一的問題，是不是全面戰爭能够速職速決。就義大利講，義大利在畏期戰爭中，沒有大量充分的金錢，可以購買必需的軍用品，不過墨棄里尼早已一再宜言，在此次戰爭未終了以前，他決心擔任一個角色，一俟終了期快近的時候，他卽奮袂而起，投身參戰。</p>
<p>五月間最初十天裏，歐洲呈現着特殊的平靜。歐洲人似在享受春天的綺麗風光。在歷史上占重要一頁的五月十日，訊者於淸晨五時爲巴黎的空襲警報所驚醒。到了七時，警報解除，記者走至街上，視察法國人對於當夜德國以閃電戰進攻荷比及法國的反響。那天早晨，巴黎的空氣，到處都不像去年九月星期日早晨英法對德宣戰那般激動。八個月來的等待，造成極大的差異。法國人都感覺事態的嚴重，但已不像去年九月那樣呆若木鷄了。早已令人觸目的防毒面具，那是很少有人戴上。去年秋天撤退的兒童，也巳漠不關心地在公園中遊玩了。</p>
<p>法國人業已獲得了滑精戰的勝利。當他們聽到希特勒命令軍隊進攻荷蘭比利時的時候，他們都聳肩微笑。國社黨的獨裁者在法國人目光中，照常是一個可笑的對象，尤其當法國人讀到他誇口的說：「今日發動的戰爭，將決定未來一千年德國民族的命運」的時候。希特勒那時顯然以更偉大的拿破崙自居。國社黨的極端派業已如願以償。挪戚用兵成功造成希特勒可以橫行無敵的自信了。</p>
<p>德國的軍隊一旦進佔了荷比法三國，希特勒及其黨人已是義無反顧。他們不是戰敗，喪失一切，便是勝利，實現其龐大約計劃。</p>

<p>防軍任務維護治安</p>
<p>三年前滬戰發生後、英國駐滬防軍卽與法美義防軍及工部局警捕當局共同合作維持公共租界及越界築路指定地帶之治安、如本市正常情形及出入自由完全恢復、則上述之防軍擔任警備之需要、不復存在、日方繼續軍事佔領虹口地區及周圍市郊、為致使防軍不克撤退之唯一原因、英國防軍之任務、僅屬警備方面、與英國國內軍隊之任務相較、自不及其重要、</p>
<p>美軍接防最孚眾望</p>
<p>英防軍總數僅二千餘人、（按實際僅一千五百餘人）苟日方決定侵犯英軍防區、彼等亦不足以予有效之抵抗、况英國目前正需要充實帝國各處之軍隊、故撤退駐滬防軍、亦不能謂爲不當、租吾人不能吾認此舉、將使本埠各界人士發生嚴重反響、同時吾人亦不能不注意、苟美海軍陸戰隊不能接防英軍防區、則租界上之警備及行政方面、將受嚴重之侵犯、</p>
<p>英國注意星洲安全</p>
<p>本埠英僑等對英防軍之撤退、須認為英國因目前歐戰而作之不愉快的犧牲、現下歐戰劇烈進行、允其是香港及星加坡受威脅之際、上海似屬不甚重要、是故各界人士對於英軍撤滬之舉、須認爲一種軍事需要行動、蓋英國他處正需要更多軍隊之故也、美國政府注意香港及星加坡之安全、不如英方之關懷、則吾人希望美當局將擴充維持上海治安之措置、或非過奢之冀望也、</p>

<p>英國駐華北陸軍竇漢隊、甫於去歲十二月下旬、撤離天津、乃英政府復決定賡續撤退其在上海及華北之軍隊、命令業於前日下午正式公佈、此後撒往之地點、英當局固未予發表、惟一般人觀察、當不出於遠東英屬各地範圍、</p>
<p>關於英軍留駐上海期內、其名額人數、可得而考者、一度於民國十六年增至二萬名、時國民軍出師北伐、初抵上海、英當局爲保護公共租界、故命由現任英軍總監之戈特子爵率領冷川衛隊來滬增防、</p>
<p>英軍首次來滬、遠在一八四二年雅片之戰以後、時上海已因條約關係開爲商埠、英軍隊在蒙脫哥墨上校指揮下、乘艦直抵上海、其來滬使命、僅爲保護公共租界、</p>
<p>迨一八五六年至一八六〇年、小刀會與太平軍拳匪相繼作亂、英法聯軍在滬取共同行動、以示抵抗、萬國商團亦起而警戒防區、時在滬之英法聯軍人數僅二千八百一十四名、一八六二年華德氏被殺、聯軍終於一八六四年擊潰太平軍締成今日史跡一頁、</p>
<p>嗣後英當局復增厚其實力、調遣印軍三千名由港來滬駐防、英法德日在滬服役之商團曁其軍隊、亦動員駐防滬區、由英軍兼火政處總司令克雷氏統率、一九〇　年後、外國軍隊始行撤退、共後之上海租界防務、悉由商團與海軍陸戰隊維持良好秩序、如是凡數年、迨一九一一年至一九一三年、始卸仔肩、一九二四年起、又復由萬國商團負保護租界治安之責、</p>
<p>國民軍於一九二七年開抵上海、當時英美法日義荷蘭與西班牙當局、先後加緊調遣其軍隊開來遠東、英軍戈特子爵之冷川衛隊、亦於是時來滬、六月三日爲英王喬洽誕辰、冷川衛隊即於是日在跑馬廳舉行大檢閱、</p>
<p>自後英軍卽長駐上海、其人數爲一千五百七十名、包括西福資高地隊及東塞萊隊、武器配備完備、現任總司令爲西蒙斯少將、西福資高地隊指揮爲茂萊上校（R.A.WolfeMurray、東塞萊隊指揮爲史惠東上校（G.E.Swinton）、（荃）</p>

<p>中國建樹亞洲均勢</p>
<p>據稱、荷比法等國雖被德國擊潰、但各該國文化亦甚昌明、德國勢不能減其國家、奴其人民、故僅能取其海外之殖民地、今日本旣將安南荷印置其勢力之下、則德國流血之結果、反使日本坐享其成、誰能甘心、故一般觀察家之意見、以爲如果德國獲勝、則其對亞洲問題、決難恝然置之、至中國問題、則中國之獨立、可以造成亞洲之均勢、歐美各國、均蒙其利、英國因在亞洲保有廣大之殖民地、故願見中國之獨立爲印度之屛障、假如德國亦如英國之地位、則其態度、亦何莫不然、</p>

<p>美蘓世界政策中，遠東和歐洲的地位孰重？</p>
<p>在輕重不同中，經濟界將起何種影響？　（續）</p>
<p>美蘇兩國的世界政策中，遠東和歐洲地位的輕重，可從政治的與經濟的兩種看法而得不同的答案。蘇聯自從和日本締結諾蒙亨協定後，在遠東取守勢而在歐洲取攻勢，所以它的世界政策中，歐洲比遠東更爲重要；同時從經濟方面看也是如此，自從和德國妥協後，隨着土地的擴展，和歐洲各國的貿易量也激劇增加。美國則不然，政治方面來看，遠東和歐洲在它世界政策中的地位是對等的，美國重要的外交準則是門羅主義，祗要各國不干涉美洲的事情，那麼美國也未必出來干涉世界的事情，所以自從中日和歐洲兩組戰爭爆發後，對於被侵略國雖作道義上的救援或間作物質上的援助，但是對於侵略國的制裁却終覺得不澈底。從經濟方面看，那麼美國的政策中，遠柬實比歐洲更爲重要，因爲美國的經濟利益在太平洋，假使它的經濟利益受到損害，美國是決不肯干休的，所以美國的評論家常說，美國在遠東的參戰可能性比歐洲爲大，就是這個意見。美國兩次的貸款給中國以購買商品，也是經濟利益受威脅後所取的必要報復行動。此外有張賢德·羅盤·王平鷗·葉子淸·施允·張君平·金亦羣等等先生之意見，亦大致近似。</p>
<h3 id="c77">美重歐而蘓重亞 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>企維　就美國世界政策加以覜察遠東地位，似較軍於歐洲；如海軍之常駐太平洋，加强斐列濱，關島，及檀香山之防禦力量，卽其明證。而蘇聯則國都卽在歐洲，故其世界政策當然視歐洲爲最重要；年來向波羅的海及巴爾幹半島諸小國之發展，亦其明證。</p>
<p>惟所謂地位之重要與否？乃係相對的，由乎國際風雲之變幻，與夫本國利害之異同，一切均有易轍可能。</p>
<p>至於經濟界之影響，就美國言：平昔與日爭霸，積不相容，故對吾國抗戰，不特予以同情，且在經濟上積極援助。如軍火機械之源源運華，專門人才之紛紛西來，以助吾國發展西南經濟，而利長期抗戰者，乃係罔知之事實。今以西南交通斷絕，輸送艱困，益以英國遭德攻擊，形勢危殆，不得不竭力援英，故對遠東事件，惟有宣佈禁運油類與廢鐵，消極的斷絕供給日本作戰之原料而已。</p>
<p>就蘇聯言：則最近在歐洲之發展，已堪滿意；益以德之閃電戰術，氣呑全歐，不無戒心，當然不願多予經濟上之援助，以自貽伊戚。故對英德爭衡，將取旁觀態度。而對遠東，則以日本係屬世仇，近目擊其强迫安南緬甸，與華斷絕交通。中國在精神上，物質上，當然不無影響。揆諸脣齒輔車之義，自不得不積極加以援助。益以西北交通，完整如昔；此後軍火，機械，人才之由蘇聯來華者，數量當有可觀截至現在爲止，已收到關於本兩問題之答案，速前已達一百四十七件，此次未特約專家作答，俾得以充分發表各界之意見。然因地位有限，割愛者尚夥；且連提名表示各人意見之辦法繼續。茲將第一題未刊完部分及第二第三題之答案，發表如次。</p>
<h3 id="c78">關於徵文 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>本週徵答之問題（四）英鎊的命運，是否取決於英國的能否持久戰？英國能不能持久戰？英鎊命運的變化，國際金融又將發生何種影響？（五）聯軍的勝敗，能不能影響到戰後的世界幣制？黃金在貨幣上的地位，戰後會不會發生變化？</p>
<p>關於該兩題之答案，文字可稍長，且可併答而不必分題，惟盼能包括上述兩點，並於本週六以前送到爲妙。。雖其程度如何？尙須視其對巴爾幹半島之態度爲衡，而其援華比重，在今日要可首屈一指，故在短期內，－戰爭時期內－吾國與蘇聯，美國與英國之經濟關係，均將更趨密切，殆可斷言。</p>
<p>此外有張琦光·戴德天·董平如·黃子平·馬浩如·兪笑山·醒余·何可等等先生意見近似。</p>

<p>劉性初　我認爲美蘇的世界政策是始終視遠東與歐洲並重的。美國此次之實施油鐵禁運方案，不但是對付歐洲的德意，而同時也是對付遠東底日本的。同樣地，近來蘇聯雖一味在北歐和巴爾幹方面鈎心鬥角，極力增强她在西北邊境的防禦力量；但是我們必須瞭解，她這種積極設施，有備無恐的精神，正是作爲來日準備應付西伯利亞方面有事之秋的。</p>
<p>如果一定需要辨別歐洲和遠東雙方得失利害孰輕孰重的話，則在美蘓的心目中，兩者之間所占的比重，與其說是在大西洋上，毋寗説是在太平洋上。果眞美蘇兩國能够憑着她們自身利害和人類的正義感而採取了聯合動作，則將形成一個如何偉大的力量是不難揣想得到的；這種偉大的力量，不僅可以一勞永逸地安定東亞，同時也必然進而安定人類的經濟秩序。</p>
<p>胡鏡清　在歐洲的一組戰爭，交戰國二方，同樣是殖民地的略奪戰；勝負誰屬？主要是在於殖民地的冉分割。遠東的一組戰爭，一方面是反侵略的自衛戰，它的勝利，能使世界遵守法律條約，保持和平秩序！另一方面則企圖獨佔中國，驅逐任何與中國發生關係的國家，而且還將世界公理正義，法律秩序都破壞光美蘇在目前的世界局勢中，是安定局勢的　柱。因爲要安定世界局勢，所以在它們的世界政策中，遠東的地位當然比歐洲爲重。至於經濟界將所起的影響；在安定的局勢中，無論是中國的或世界的必然可能傾向繁榮，因爲中國是在建設的途中，它是有無盡的隱藏，需要着世界的經濟界去　　問發。否則；如世界的安定不能建立，則經濟界只有窒息而死！</p>
<p>蔣執誠　在歐局（英德）相持不下而無法獲致妥協的情形中、美國的世界政策、着重在對遠東的控制；目下美國正在努力擴充軍力、其意義是：（甲）有退度地帮助英國，使其能對德　持久作戰，造成相持局面。（乙）防衛德義向美洲發展；（丙）主要的是準備攫奪澳洲，太平洋，印度洋以至非洲的殖民地躬小國家，（丁）作爲反侵略及被壓迫民族解放運動的台柱。</p>
<p>蘇聯的世界政策是儘量消弭國際反蘇戰爭的可能，加强帝國主義國家間的矛盾，及增强世界革命（無產階級社會革命和被壓迫民族解放運動）的力量。因此，在同樣的情形（英德相持）之下，蘇聯目下要着重在充分援助被壓迫民族的解放運動，以替世界革命準備決定勝負的條件；遠東正是民族運動的主流。</p>
<p>整個世界經濟將要受到戰爭劇烈的破壞和影響；美國和蘇聯加强了對世界經濟的控制力量，後者特別對芬，瑞典！·南·土和近東遠東的半獨立性國家，這些國家的民族經濟，一般的將獨立向上發展，而中國民族經濟在堅持抗戰國策之下，尤有自由發展的光明前途！</p>

<p>陳龍章　美蘇的世界政策：在目前顯然是歐洲重於遠東。美國用提高金鎊價格平衡美英匯兌作經濟援助。最終目的在挽救英帝國的崩潰，不致影響整個金融資本主義的前途。蘇聯爲防止帝國主義戰爭向巴爾幹及北歐蔓延，努力增强並擴展紅軍的實力及社會主義國家的據點；最終結果將令德國無法覓得巴爾幹及北歐國家之物質供給（包括油與糧食等）。並使英國失去各中立小國的同情援助。雙方作戰困難加重，終至提早結束戰爭。</p>
<p>至於遠東，美國因利益較少，故她採着不與日本直接衝突的政策。但中國將源源獲得蘇聯更大的援助（包括軍火與飛機等），並將隨時間的進展感到社會主義國家援助的偉大性可靠和永久性。在美蘇的世界政策中，中國將必然走向自足自給的經濟道路。</p>
<p>此外有路陵仝·曹林曄·懷瑜·柳華·馬之尼·過寳賢·錢流·森·白鷗·毛琦·董發祥·兪亦中·黃霖南·黃日德·羅維吾·等等先生意見近似。</p>
<p>遠東和歐局，在何種情形下將起聨繫可能大？還是個別可能大？</p>
<h3 id="c81">第一組答案 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>王蕭　這個問題，應從遠東與歐洲兩戰局的本質及其環繞着的國際環境中求解答第一，遠東戰局，從中國講，是爲了民族的解放。從日本講，是爲了擴大殖民地。歐洲戰局，無論是德義和英國，皆是爲了爭奪殖民地。這里已可以發見端倪，那就是除了中國進行戰爭的目的不同於別國之外，日本進行戰爭的目的，基本上是和英德義相同的。</p>
<p>照目前形勢看來，英德義雙方都在極力拉攏日本來牽制對方。但假定某方拉攏了日本，而中國却是置之不理的，中國決不會聯絡日英來打德義，也不會聯絡德義來打英美。因之，這一聯繫是單方面的。而在目前講，它的確有很大的可能性。</p>
<p>第二，假定歐洲的反蘇戰爭組成的時候，（這可能性是在逐漸减退）或者是美國參加歐戰而在大西洋太平洋上同時作戰的話；（照羅斯福的擴軍預算看來，他有這樣決心。）那末中國也祇有埋頭加緊自己的抗戰。</p>
<p>結論是這樣的：遠東和歐局的聯繫將是單方面的。</p>
<p>畢國材　遠東之戰，爲被侵略者謀國家民族之生存，所發生之門爭；歐西之戰，爲列强互爭世界霸權與殖民地，所引起之鬥爭。兩者目標旣殊，自難起聯繫作用。卽使國際形勢轉變，美助英與德義戰，日本乘機南進，因而引發美日之衝突，亦未許目爲聯繫，蓋中國固未曾與德義爲敵也；卽德義旣未與日同盟，亦決無助日攻我之理，良以少樹敵，似較有利於彼也。况德義日貌合神離，彼此利害亦絕無協調可能。然則遠東與歐局，終無聯繫之可能歟？似亦不然，兩虎相鬥，必有死傷，彼時世界之被壓迫者，必乘機而起，謀國家之獨立，民族之解放，而遠東與歐局之聯繫亦其時矣！惟兩者之可能孰大，此時尙難斷言，必有待事實之證明也。</p>
<p>至於經濟界，在聯繫之狀態下，各國必走上强盛民族資本之道，以排斥布隊資本，在個別之狀態下，世界經濟將形成二大集團，一以英美爲中心，一以德義爲主體。相互對立，各爭雄長。在這不同局勢下。中國經濟界，唯有放準目光，把握時機，用有利於抗戰之手腕，以適應環境，使中國早日完成抗戰之使命。</p>
<p>渡雲　遠東和歐西在保持世界各國固有的疆域所謂反侵略的同一情形下，起聯繫作用。惟因在遠東支持者爲中國，歐西支持者爲英國，在各個認淸所謂惟一狄人外，與其他各國似乎無甚惡感，於是就起了個別作用。依目前情形而論，將來還是個別可能比較大。直至有一方面－遠東或歐西的支持者－獲得了勝利後，或許會開始轉到聯繫方面去。</p>
<h3 id="c82">第二組答案 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>蔣執誠　就世界政治和世界經濟的意義言，遠東和歐洲本來是一個聯繫體。單單就軍事的觀點言，雖可分爲遠柬戰塲和歐洲戰塲，但是「戰爭是流血的政治」無非是爲了達到經濟掠奪和政治統治的目的，從這個論點來看兩個戰局，那末我以爲現在問題在於美國：（甲）美國干涉歐戰（嚴重援英）引起德義日軸心的加强和協調，使兩地戰局混合一體。（乙）美國加强遠東政策，不干涉歐戰（某種程度上說），可能使戰爭個別地發展。歐洲以英德義相對立，遠東以中蘇美和日本對立。在一個短時期內，戰爭有個別發展可能。然面戰爭有自己的邏輯，它將依着自己的邏輯走。帝國主義者可以發動戰爭，但是控制不了戰爭，戰爭終將發展或自己的世界整體，以完成其歷史任務。</p>
<p>企經　遠東和歐局，在下列任何一種情勢下，均將起聯繫作用。卽</p>
<p>（一）英國在歐洲對德義宣戰；在遠東又因日本之壓迫而對之宣戰。，（中國雖無對德義宜戰之理由，惟因事實上與英站立於一條戰綫上，客觀上不啻與德義處於敵對地位。）</p>
<p>（二）美國因日本南進政策之猛進，備受威脅，不得不出於助英對軸心國德義日宜戰之一途</p>
<p>（三）蘇俄與英捐棄成見，繼美對全能國宣戰</p>
<p>上項作用，目前尙難逆覩，反之在遠東中日雖繼續進行戰爭，而在歐洲英與德義之戰事，亦在繼續，惟範圍並不廣大，不起聯繫作用，是卽個别的戰爭。</p>
<p>依照目前形勢推測，則</p>
<p>（一）英國一國，苟無其他强國之贊助，決無同時在歐洲對德義，在遠東對日本作戰之勇氣</p>
<p>（二）美國祇求大量產銷軍用品，旣可獲得鉅利，且可兼得支撑正義之美名，一時似無參戰</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯本身爲共產中義國家，與一切民主國或全能國，均難沆瀣一氣，最佳爲列强均牽入漩渦，而已能置身事外，坐觀其斃，更無助英參戰可能。</p>
<p>根據二述：可見遠東與歐洲戰事，其聯繫性可能程度，可稱甚少。惟歐洲英與德義戰事　，苟難速戰速決，而成持久膠着之局，而遠東中日戰事，一時亦不能解決，則美爲本身利害計，或有參戰可能，而使雙方戰局，發生聯繫作用也。</p>
<h3 id="c83">第三組答案 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>酈展濤　日本之南進政策，無非藉此恫嚇英美各國，逼使退出遠東，獨遂漁利。按目下形勢觀察，日本之南進政策，大有促成英美在遠東的加强合作，甚至發生戰事，亦殊可能。如是則日本必乞憐於德義以求合作。中國爲獨立生存而抗戰，對於歐亞聯繫，原非本意，爲防止日本由南進政策而進窺川滇，難免被瀛與英美併肩合作，以禦日本，結果，遠東與歐局將起聯繫作用。英美如顧慮歐局，向日示弱，而退出遠東或俯首聽從，則日本必先努力加緊侵華行動矣。蘇聯在歐亞間雖有舉足輕重之勢，良以蘇聯在目今正當西陸邊防未鞏，及專心整頓國力之時，似不願與任何一强國爲難，况日本在最近斷不敢刺激蘇聯，於是遠東與歐局，仍各據一方，不相爲侔也。</p>
<p>按目前情勢推測將來，似以個別作用爲大。</p>
<p>公孫承元　如果日本與德意的關係能一强化到軍事同盟，遠東和歐局就會聯繫起來。但蘇美可能在東方組成一個對抗的集團，儘管蘇聯在西方與德國結合。這種反應日本是知道，所以近衛的外交政策一方面想强化德意日軸心，一方面又想調整對蘇美的邦交，這種外交政策演進的結果，德意與日軍事同盟的成立是不可能的。根據這種情勢推測，歐局和遠東在最近的將來是不會聯繫起來。但如果西歐的戰爭判定了勝負，歐局和遠東無疑義將聯繫起來。（未完）</p>

<p>— 聖凱</p>
<p>農業金融的促進</p>
<p>中國政府在農業金融方面，最近有兩種新的施政。一是全國糧食管理局業於八月一日起開始工作，內分行政管制處，辦理糧食底調査統計等事項，業務管制處，辦理糧食底產銷等事項，及運銷處和秘書室。該局初步工作在求明暸全國糧食情形——特別是糧食及糧食商人已往的狀況；然後再進行糧食調劑工作，一方面注重軍食民食有計劃的調劑，一方面注重合理的分配。二是省縣農業金融促進委員會底組織。按　中交農四行聯合辦事總處爲發展農業經濟起見，在四聯總處之下，會設立一農業金融處，其後又組織一農業金融設計委員會，去襄助中央農業金融政策的推進。現在爲使各地方農業金融依照中央旣定方針，配合各方面的力量能切實推行起見，訂定一「省縣農業金融促進委員會組織　則」，分函四行，農本局，及四聯總處各省分處，共同籌劃設立省縣農業金融促進委員會。</p>
<p>中國自從事長期抗戰以來，沿海繁榮的都市，旣已完全破壞，後方的經濟建設正在進行的過程中，爲維持前方士兵的給養，與後方民衆的衣食，以及增加出口貿易，供給工業原料，多殖難民墾荒等，無一不須依賴農業金融的推動。但是要農業金融能推動農業經濟底發展去增加生產，必須政府能積極地實施戰時農業金融政策，尤重在配合各方面的力量，去切實推進農業金融政策。一九三八年四月二十九日公佈的改善地方金融機構辦法綱要，以及一九三九年三月六日的重慶金融會議中的六項議案，是中國戰時農業金融政策中最著的一項政策，而今年中，交，農二行和中央信託，農本兩局的農貸辦法綱要，尤使農　　　得　此有長足的進展。但是農貸辦法綱要的貸款驅域以四川西康兩省爲首要區，暫時未能普及；重慶金融會議案中關於收購物資，平衡物價，接濟糧食各案，都未能切實推行。而在此抗戰建國時期：基於軍事上的理由，前方需要給養甚多，必須要能充分維持供應，尤其如何計劃地方調劑民食軍食；基於貿易上的理由，抗戰以來淪陷區的工業多半停頓，自由中國的工業正在建設，現在可能輸出的，尤惟農產品是賴；基於財政上的理由，中國戰時財力的增長，在於收集十四類的農業產品出口統制的外匯；　基於抗建上的理由，向美國的兩次信用借款，和向蘇聯的物物交換，亦全都是以桐油，茶茶，猪鬃等農產品作爲祖保或交換。所以非極力利用農業金融以播動農業生產的增加不可，而如何使政府的農業金融政策能有効地運行，非努力於促進工作不可</p>
<p>促進農業金融以發展農業經濟，俾供應士兵給養，維持民衆衣食，增加士貨出口，供給工業原料，是中國抗戰勝利的原動力。故全國糧食管理局的開始工作，省縣農業金融促進委員會的組織，實予中國人以莫大的期望！（未完）</p>

<p>— 金俠聞</p>
<p>奇矣哉！女子之服裝也。古者長袖善舞，顧盼生姿，今則袖不及肘矣。八幅羅裙，曳地生塵，今則褲不蔽膝矣。抹胸束肚，遮蔽胸前，今則崇尚衛生，兩乳高聳矣。拖軟木鞋，披白綢褂，猶餘事也。或曰：時勢不同，服裝變易，子猶泥古之道，而非今之俗，不亦迂乎？曰不然，章身之具，所以尚禮制，明貴賤也。羅衣半臂，浴罷乘凉，不登於大雅之堂。六寸圓膚光緻緻，赤足鄕姑，豈可儕於閨閣之列乎？靑樓蕩婦倡於前，大家閨秀效於後，冶容誨淫，毀禮蔑敎，紫色奪朱，鄭聲亂樂，人品之邪正，門第之高低，黑白混淆，令人莫辨。國家將亡，必有妖孽，服之不衷，爲身之災，有心人所以痛哭流涕者也。夫夫婦爲人倫之始，刑于之敎，至於兄弟，關睢之化，迨及諸侯，正人必先正已，治國必本齊家，鬢高至於一尺，細腰因之减食，風俗所趨，流弊有不可勝言者，可不大聲疾呼，以求改善乎？</p>
<p>今者男女平等，提倡女權，要求參政，研究科學，服務社會國家，疇不以梁紅玉沈雲英自許；，而章身之具，尚追縱倡妓乎？改良之法，本屬不難，女界明達先進，宜先集議衣服式樣尺寸；閨門少女，添製衣裳，家長宜示以典型；學校學生，明令公佈，校長卷屬宜爲之先導。今之靑衣長衫，風行一時，風度適彰其高，形態咸羨爲美，綾羅綢緞，各視身家，惟袖必及肘，褲必蔽膝耳。一轉移間，風俗丕變矣。惟放胸聳乳，確係生理上所必需，關係生育前途至爲重大，改善之法，腰身漸崇寬大，使身軀不露凹凸之形，不以曲綫爲美，大小適體，其庶幾矣。愛國女子，何去何從，幸有以敎我。</p>

<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>偶然在報紙上而，看到家眼鏡公司的廣告，買太陽眼鏡，當心洋瓶底肚，」的確帶有三分幽默的口氣，但事實上太陽眼鏡，市上劣質的很多，購買時也不可不愼。</p>
<p>天氣一熱，太陽眼鏡就時髦起來了，馬路上面，摩登的姐兒，西裝的哥兒都得戴上一副黑眼鏡，使人在驀地裏，就是熟人，也認不出廬山眞面。然而人們祇知夏天一展開，戴上黑眼鏡是很摩登，而不知劣質的太陽眼鏡，自有其特具的害處。</p>
<p>這是粗淺的常識，不光是太陽眼鏡，就是普通的眼鏡，能够不戴最好，戴上了就不能脫去，而且愈戴愈深，使目力更是不濟。美國方面，對於太陽眼鏡的出售，有一種法令，就是一切太陽眼鏡的玻璃片或其他製成水晶體的材料，顏色和密度如果不配，透明的程度標準不楚最高以及容易變形者，都在禁售之例。</p>
<p>在上海，甚至在整個的中國，這種禁令是完全沒有，一般戴太陽眼鏡的人，也許注意不到太陽眼鏡的好，足以影響目力的。有許多人想戴太陽眼鏡，更一意揀價錢便宜的買，要知這種低價的劣質眼鏡，你戴一個夏天，會使你的目力受損不淺。</p>

<h3 id="c93">談談睡眠 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 田靑</p>
<p>一個人勞動了整整的一天，到了晚上，便感覺得疲倦不堪，需要休息，而睡眠却是休息的最好方法，不論古今中外的人士都目爲晚上，是唯一的睡眠時間，不過也有一般人，在晚上很活動，而日中却無聲無息的睡眠，因此與日光見面的機會難得獲到，那可確定這種人的身體是未見高明的了，更有人以爲休息能够妨礙工作，但不知工作正需要休息來促進它，因爲人是一座奇妙的機器，無生命的機器尚需休息，而人可以不休息的嗎？不然機器要有爆裂的危險，人過度的操作勞動，當然也有生病的可能，所以睡眠是我們絕對需要的。</p>
<p>睡眠的時間，普通認爲小孩每天至少要有十六小時的睡眠，成人每天應該有八小時，而我們勞心的人能睡足八小時，已很足够，不過下午九十點鐘卽應安睡，過早過晚皆不宜，頂好一到了床上，把其他一切的思念拋去，就閉上了眼睛，安安地睡去，而且睡得要熟，使身體的各部完全停止活動，不過心，肺等部是不會停止的。所以最好的休息是無夢的睡眠，如果一做了夢，腦神經便沒有休息，而腦在白天中工作得最勞苦，一切的動作思念，都是由它支配吩附的：到了晚上，還不能安安的休息，那這種睡眠依舊不能把疲勞肅淸，還沒有達到充分的程度，到了白天，精神便不能振足，幹事也毫無興趣了。</p>
<p>至於陲眠的姿勢也應注意，普通以爲上半夜宜向右邊睡臥，因爲胄的下口（入腸之處，傾向右邊，所以向右邊臥，使停留在胃中的食物，容易入十二腸而輸入小腸，下半夜宜向左邊臥。但是科學家認爲仰臥最好，因為我們的背上有一根很粗直的脊椎骨，身體仰臥，就可維持它的正直，而身體內各部器官也能停止在正確的位置。如果向左側臥，而我們心臟是偏側的，如何能受這樣的壓迫呢？但側臥也有好處，就是生殖器官不致受到壓抑，而引起遺尿性慾衝動及遺精等的影響。</p>

<h3 id="c98">「秋老虎」 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 常</p>
<p>立秋後的一塲大雨，天氣突然凉快了，確有「一雨成秋」的樣子。但是大水沒有退盡，太陽又從雲層裏探出頭來，那熱辣辣的氣燄，更高過大伏裏的日子，而且樹梢不動，風息全無，將死的秋蟬也乘着這最後的機會大聲吶喊這悶奧的氣候，稱之曰「秋老虎」。</p>
<p>老虎是可怕的野獸。舊小說中形容老虎將出現時的一聲虎嘯，讀之不塞而顫。於是大人們哄騙孩子的時候，都說「老虎來了！」端午節額上寫了「王」字，竟有驅邪之功。甚至婦人之潑辣者，亦叫「雌老虎」。總之，「老虎」已是可怕的代表詞。「秋老虎」者，卽是「秋」天的「老虎」日子之謂也。</p>
<p>但是馬戲班中的訓獸者，不但老虎，其他獅豹等　，也在一支電鞭的指揮中，使它們安然就範，鑽火圈，過繩橋，不敢有絲毫的反抗。即使有時也想怒吼一聲，却祇要鞭子着地有聲，也就俯首帖耳了。這還是眞的老虎。</p>
<p>小學敎科書中，有一驢蒙虎皮」一課。那驢子蒙上了一張虎皮，就自以爲是「虎」了，可是一旦敗露，還不是一頭黔驢？這就是俗語所謂「戳穿紙老虎」也。</p>
<p>交了秋令，氣候當然會凉快下來，這兩天的奧熱，正如立春的以後必有幾天「冷爆頭」，而况到了晚上，已經是秋凉如水的光景了。</p>

<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>我站電梯中，自然要充分利用我的視覺，可是我不敢利用得過分急促。我裝做很自然的樣子，把眼光在這不滿六尺見方的電梯間中打了一個旋。電梯中一共有八九個人，男的，女的，老的，少的，當然都有。我的視綫最後自然會停留在我所追踪的末了第二個的西裝男子身上。他背向着我，穿一身豆沙色黑條紋司邦推克施的西裝，簇新而畢挺，身材比我短一二寸，頭上不戴帽子，烏黑的濃髮，膏抹得在電燈下面發光。我把身子漸漸兒移前一些，轉到他的前面，鼻子裏裏就接觸一陳香味。我的視錢射到了他的臉上，我不禁失望了。他不是趙伯難！</p>
<p>電梯過了二層，三層，關門，開門，照例吐出和收進幾個旅客。但我所注目的人並不出去。他有一個狹長的臉，白晳的皮膚分明一半是雪花膏的功勞。一雙活潑的眼睛，配上兩條濃眉，一個高樑的鼻子，的確有一種「可怕的」男子美！美字上面怎麽可加上可怕的形容詞呢？因爲男子具備了這副俊秀的容貌，自然有一種吸引女性的神秘力量。一個少年男子具備着這種神秘力，如果缺乏了透徹的理智和堅毅的定力，往往會不自覺地斷送掉他的事業，他的人格，甚至他的性命！那怎不可怕？</p>
<p>我不認識這個人－不，我忽然想起了那七十一號茶房的說話。當他看了霍桑給他熊的那張余甘棠的照片時，曾說他見那少年時，他好像在發脾氣，和照片上的笑臉不同。對，此刻站在我面前的少年，也沉着臉兒，絕對沒有笑容。憑着照片去辨別個人的面貌，本不是一件怎樣容易的事。如果喜怒各殊，那就更覺困難。不過也有一個訣竅，你得抓住面部的一個特點。余甘棠自然也有他的特點，兩道濃眉，一個高鼻，無論他喜笑惱怒，這特點總不會走樣。</p>
<p>唉，這個人就是余甘棠，！</p>
<p>電梯已升到六層樓。他仍不走。電梯中却祇剩了五六個人。我估量他的年紀，還祇二十左右。像他這樣的年紀，他的面貌上又充分顯示他具有豐美的天資，却爲着一個墮落的女性，蒙受着殺人的嫌疑！我祇有暗暗地喞嘆。這時他臉色不但沉着，還有一種惶急焦慮的神氣。他的右手揷在他的短褂袋中，左手不時撫摸那條紅藍斜條紋的領帶。他旋轉身子向着電梯間的門，他預備要出去了。到了七層樓開門的時候，他果眞走出去。我當然也不動聲色地跟出去。　（七三）</p>

<p>今天看到本刋一幅莽頭店客滿的揷圖，這固然是一樁嚴重問題，但另一方面未始非一部份娘姨揀瘦選肥所造成的局面，下面是一個例子。</p>
<p>我有個親戚，家裏人多，向來僱一個從本鄉出來的老娘姨。上月裏，娘姨有事情回去了，就託人在荐頭店找尋一個，做了一天，她推說身體不好走了，不得已，再託人找一個。但是過了幾時，又說同鄕人出來叫她回去，又走了。如此接連的掉了好幾個，終於到了今天，還是一個不落局。後來那位親戚奇怪極了，「爲什麽上海娘姨同要人一樣，席不暇暖？」於是費了許多日子去伯查，方才恍然而大悟。</p>
<p>上海地方畢竟非凡，所謂人傑地靈，內地出來的阿土生，經過上海洗禮，霎霎眼，完全變一副樣子。娘姨們又豈能例外？原來現在上海多的是「暴發戶，他們好在多的是錢，多僱些娘姨裝裝幌子，是不礙事的，她們工作閒，外快多，什麽都較普通人家好，所以一般娘姨都眼睜睜地想吃肥肉，乾脆地說，她們都在想不勞而獲。可是金張門第，決非她們垂手而得，於是只好挨戶去碰。這一來就苦了一般普通人家，同時荐頭店也門庭如市了。</p>

<p>Beijing Today's News: British troops stationed in Beijing and the British concession in Tianjin will withdraw to Hong Kong this week. There are 120 British troops in Tianjin and 50 here. It is reported that all are preparing to leave the country (Fifteenth International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The Washington Star newspaper commented yesterday on the British troop withdrawal from China, stating that the U.S. government will not withdraw its troops stationed in China until the "open door" policy is guaranteed. The newspaper stated that, according to London's view, the British are withdrawing their troops from China because the reason for stationing troops was to prevent bandits, but this reason has now disappeared. "However, the U.S. government believes that the Japanese's brutal actions in the war against China, and the pressure exerted by the Japanese government and the Japanese army on the interests of Western countries in Shanghai, are more important than the bandit problem in old China. What the U.S. government wants is the open door that has been sought since the establishment of the public concessions. What the U.S. government is concerned about regarding Japan is the closing of the door (Eleventh United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Washington officials initially reacted unfavorably to the withdrawal of British troops stationed in China. Now, however, the U.S. hopes that Britain's appeasement policy towards Japan may end from now on, as there is a growing belief that Britain is now withdrawing its isolated troops to prepare for a scorched-earth policy, so that when Japan makes endless demands, a final showdown can be made. It is understood that Japan has always regarded foreign troops stationed in Shanghai and North China as hostages. Britain now seems to want to remove these hostages to avoid being held hostage by Japan. If so, then this move by Britain is an indication of adopting a tough policy to replace the appeasement policy (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: Informed sources in Kunming have received reliable news stating that if Japan attacks Vietnam, the French troops stationed in Vietnam will resist according to the instructions issued by the Vichy government a few days ago. Apart from submarines, the French troops in Vietnam do not seem to be strong. However, it is reported that efforts are now being made to strengthen maritime and aerial defenses in the shortest possible time. Those familiar with the situation believe that Japan's desire to occupy Vietnam is not a major concern for the Chongqing government. The Japanese army will not be able to penetrate deep into the Sino-Vietnamese border. The terrain is dangerous, and the Chinese troops gathered on the Yunnan border may enter Vietnam first and occupy strategic areas to consolidate defenses. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for the Japanese army to invade Yunnan from Vietnam. At the same time, what will Berlin think of the Japanese attack on Vietnam? This is also a question that requires much speculation. The Nazi Party certainly welcomes Japan's attack on areas where British interests lie in the Far East, but it may not welcome Japan's attack on colonies that have become German possessions due to France's failure. Observers here, weighing the pros and cons, feel that Japan will lose more than it gains if it rashly attacks Vietnam (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Soviet diplomatic sources here revealed today, hinting that regarding the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union, the British government may send a note to the Soviet Union in a short period of time to explain its attitude. The main issues that Moscow hopes to resolve are three: (1) The deposits and claims of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in the United Kingdom have been "frozen" by the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union hopes to lift the ban immediately. (2) The ships of each country detained by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union hopes to receive. (3) It is hoped that the United Kingdom can formally recognize the incorporation of each country into the Soviet Union as soon as possible. Regarding this issue, it is quite enough to cause twists and turns. Although the ambassadors of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the United Kingdom have been ordered to hand over the embassy affairs to the Soviet ambassador, none of them have complied. In short, the Soviet government hopes that the United Kingdom will decide its attitude on the above three issues as soon as possible. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, although these matters involve a lot, its sincere desire to be on good terms with the Soviet Union is also a real situation. In any case, it is expected that the British government will send an official document to the Soviet Union within this week (Tenth Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the national consumption of cigarettes in Japan has increased every year, with an average annual increase of 10%. Taking only this year's statistics, the average cigarette expenditure borne by each Japanese citizen is about six yuan. This figure is an average allocation based on the national population. If only smokers are counted, the cigarette expenditure consumed by each smoker is very alarming. It is said that this phenomenon is caused by Japan's industrialization, because most workers smoke, and even underage child laborers often have a smoking addiction (Tenth Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">A Review of Japan's Strategy for Invading China <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>A review of Japan's strategy for invading China over the past year reveals that it underwent a shift around the autumn and winter of last year, and the invasion of Guangxi served as a signal of this shift. Prior to that, the Japanese army focused more on Hunan, Hubei in Central China, and Shanxi in North China. In practical terms, there were several battles in northern Jiangxi, central Hubei, and northern Hunan, as well as more than a dozen "mopping-up" wars in the Zhongtiao and Lüliang Mountains. Since November, the four southern theaters have been the target of Japanese attention. The determined defense of Yongning stronghold, the construction of the Yongqin Railway, and several instances of ravaging along the Zuojiang, Yujiang, and Yongbin-Yongwu highways all prove that the situation in that area was the focus of Japanese aspirations. Although the recent capitulation of French Indochina to Japan and the eagerness of Japanese attempts to advance south are all consequences of the sudden changes in the European situation, which were not foreseen when the Japanese army began to harass southern Guangxi, the invasion of Guangxi remains a new starting point for Japan's strategic emphasis on advancing south, and it has laid a favorable foundation for various recent expansions of ambition.</p>
<p>This strategic shift was the product of Nishio and Itagaki's arrival in China, and is largely the masterpiece of Itagaki. His slogan is to continue the offensive along the lines and cut off China's transportation routes. His goal is to blockade the southwestern international passage, but he has not neglected attempts to harass the coast, destroy the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan-Guangxi lines, open the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, and obstruct the Northwest-Soviet Union transportation route. If the purpose of the Japanese side in the Xiangzao Campaign in May this year was to occupy Laohekou in order to spy on Shaanxi, then the intention of the Yichang Campaign was probably to prepare for a southern invasion of Changde and even western Hunan. The blockade and harassment of the Zhejiang-Fujian coast, and the ravages of northern Guangdong and the Dongjiang River also contain the meaning of destroying China's coastal and inland transportation. However, the most important thing is still the action in the Guangxi-Guangdong area, because the Japanese warlords have always fantasized that once the southwestern international passage is cut off, there is hope for resolving the Sino-Japanese War; on the other hand, that military action just coincides with the loud calls for advancing south within Japan. Therefore, even though the Japanese army's harassment in various parts of southern Guangxi has been repeatedly thwarted, they have spared no effort to maintain the strongholds of Yongning and Qinfang at a great cost. This strategic shift is better than the previous jumping-style harassment and the situation of hovering between internal invasions and "mopping-up", but at the same time, it also exposes the exhaustion of the Japanese side's strength and inner anxiety, and its so-called cutting off China's transportation routes has always been an excuse to cover up its military failures. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese coast has been blockaded by the Japanese side, and they have used their absolute superiority in the navy to gradually occupy every important port in China; compared with Japan, which has a strong navy and merchant ships, the international transportation capacity that China can use is at most only a fraction of that of the Japanese side. However, the Japanese side does not hesitate to exaggerate to the extreme, attributing all the responsibility for China's inability to recover to this weak international transportation capacity, and adopting such an excuse does not seem to be the glory of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>However, Itagaki's strategic attempt has not achieved more than the previous Japanese commanders. The occupation of Qinfang and Yongning may be regarded by the Japanese side as a satisfactory gain, but it has neither obtained the convenience of invading the southwestern hinterland, nor has it achieved the practical effect of cutting off the Yue-Gui transportation. If it were not for the defeat of France and the inability to effectively resist Japan, the desire to cut off the transportation of Vietnam would never be achieved by the actions of the Japanese army. In addition, although it has also invaded Jingzhou, Shashi, and Yichang, the strength it has consumed is considerable, and the impact on the overall war situation is still very minimal. As for the blockade and harassment of the Zhejiang-Fujian sea, it is fundamentally a failure.</p>
<p>The reversal of the international situation has certainly satisfied the Japanese warlords' ambition to blockade the southwestern international transportation, but it has also promoted the implementation of the U.S. embargo. Comparing the two, whether it is a gain or a loss, perhaps only the Japanese authorities themselves know, and the crisis in Vietnam has therefore become more tense. From the time when the Japanese side proposed the demand for an embargo in mid-June, the Japanese army in southern Guangxi divided its forces to invade westward, one route invading Longzhou Zhennanguan from Yongning, and the other invading Dongxing on the border between Guangdong and Vietnam from Fangcheng, and it was reported that the Japanese side had made demands on French Indochina for transit and the establishment of bases. In the middle of last month, the Japanese army gathered in large numbers in central China, seeming to be about to invade Changsha or spy on Changde again, but it has been nearly a month since then, and there has been no action, which is obviously affected by the change of the Japanese political situation and the implementation of the southward policy. It is expected that in the near future, the Japanese army may temporarily abandon the offensive on other battlefields in order to devote all its efforts to the invasion of the southwest and the oppression of Vietnam. This may be the concrete manifestation of the so-called "placing its focus on the resolution of the China Incident." This is not enough to affect the Sino-Japanese war situation, just as the previous blockade of China was not enough to weaken China's resistance strength. What Japan needs now is to gain without effort, rather than greater reckless action and adventure. If it really wants to recklessly engage in disregard of everything, then no matter what the reactions of the great powers and French Indochina are, China will inevitably practice the declaration of June 23 and engage in further self-defense actions. The Japanese army has invaded southern Guangxi for nine months, and even though it has tried its best to support it, it has achieved no major success so far. Even if it takes the risk of wrongdoing and expands the southwestern battlefield beyond the borders of China, it will only disperse its forces and make enemies on all sides, and the purpose it seeks is still achievable but unattainable; what the Japanese authorities are now pleased with will inevitably regret their rash miscalculation at that time.</p>

<p>Spokesperson for the Chongqing Military Council discusses that in the past week, all Chinese troops on various fronts have made progress. The Japanese only hold onto their strongholds and do not engage in actual combat. The Chinese troops, according to their planned strategies, continue to exert local, fierce attacks, achieving great victories. The battle situation is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Guangxi and Guangdong</p>
<p>In southern Guangxi, Japanese troops who ventured to attack from areas such as Fulao have been repeatedly ambushed by Chinese forces, and they have all retreated to their original positions. Simultaneously, Chinese troops on both sides of the Yongqin Road took advantage of the situation to launch fierce attacks on Qin County, recovering many outer strongholds, posing a great threat to the Japanese rear. In Guangdong's Hainan Island, Chinese troops controlled various transportation routes, preventing the Japanese from operating. Furthermore, Japanese troops who attacked from Xinhui and Zengcheng suffered heavy losses and have not yet succeeded. Chinese troops advancing towards Shenzhen Shatoujiao and other areas have killed over six hundred Japanese in the past three days. Fierce battles are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>In Hubei, the Japanese troops trapped on the southern bank of Yichang have suffered heavy casualties due to continuous encirclement and attacks by Chinese forces. The Chinese troops are still continuing to clear the area. Japanese troops in Jingmen, Xingshan, Dangyang, and other places have also launched several offensives, all of which have been repelled. In addition, Chinese troops on the east bank of the Xiang River have taken advantage of the continuous rain to attack the Japanese in Sui County, breaking through the north gate, killing countless Japanese, and burning down many Japanese warehouses. Japanese boats on the Dongting Lake surface in northern Hunan have been active in the past week. A part of them, under the cover of Japanese naval gunfire, attempted to land from Yueyang to Yanglinzui Lushitan and other places on the opposite bank, but were met with fierce resistance by the Chinese forces. The remaining Japanese fled back to the Japanese warships and escaped to Yueyang. There are currently no traces of the Japanese in various places.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Henan</p>
<p>More than 2,000 Japanese troops in southeastern Shanxi have launched attacks from Gaoping towards Macunzhen Gaopingguan and other places for several consecutive days. They were intercepted by Chinese forces and suffered heavy losses. Fierce battles are still ongoing near Gaopingguan. The Japanese troops attacking near Xiangling in southwestern Shanxi were defeated by Chinese forces. The Japanese then reinforced their attack from the east but failed. Chinese troops have launched continuous attacks on the Japanese troops in Quwo, Houma, and other areas. Another unit of Chinese troops fiercely attacked the Japanese troops between Wenxi and Anyi, and thoroughly destroyed the transportation in that section. Japanese troops in various places are now extremely panicked. Chinese troops in northern Henan have launched several attacks on the Japanese troops in the outer strongholds of Qinyang, such as Qilitun, in the past week, killing more than 500 Japanese troops. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in eastern Henan's Minquan, Lanfeng, Kaocheng, and other places have launched a large-scale attack on Kongzhuang Xiaolizhuang and other areas southeast of Kaocheng in recent days. Chinese forces have launched separate fierce attacks, killing more than 400 Japanese troops and destroying many vehicles. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attacks and fled. In addition, a unit of 500 Chinese troops in southern Henan attacked the Japanese troops stationed at Youhe, an outer stronghold of Xinyang, leading to fierce battles and killing hundreds of Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Shandong Province</p>
<p>In Shandong, victories have been achieved in both the north and south in the past week. The Japanese troops entrenched in Yishui have launched several offensives, all of which have been repelled by Chinese forces.

Dingzhuang and Laizhuang, and other strongholds have been successively recovered. Furthermore, the Japanese troops entrenched in Yangning launched attacks on Foshan, Makou, and other places but were fiercely attacked by Chinese troops, killing more than 400 Japanese troops, including Captain Nakamura. Japanese vehicles and quick response units from Licheng, Jiyang, Zhangqiu, Zouping, Huimin, Shanghe, and other counties also launched separate offensives, all of which were repelled, and the Japanese suffered many casualties. Another unit of Chinese troops, after defeating the invading Japanese, stormed into Zhangqiu City in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3 id="e24">German Dive Bomber Successfully Designed After Thousands of Hours; First Appearance in Spanish Civil War <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Aviation Communication: The internationally renowned German dive bomber did not only make its mark during the battles of Belgium and France. When the German army set out for Norway, this type of bomber had already repeatedly achieved remarkable success in destroying British armored warships. The mechanism of the dive bomber is extremely sophisticated and complex. Its success was not accidental. At the beginning of the revival of the German Air Force, General Udet, the Director of the Technical Department of the German Aviation Ministry, entrusted experts with the important task of creating a dive bomber. Mr. Pohlmann was one of the technical guidance directors among the design specialists.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Pohlmann, for the advancement of dive bombers, special attention must be paid to the fact that the aircraft must be able to carry bombs weighing up to 400 pounds each and must have the ability to hit extremely small targets when diving at full speed. Initially, aircraft manufacturing experts believed that under the above circumstances, a maximum of only 200 kilograms of bombs could be carried.</p>
<p>Since the manufacturers of dive bombers aimed to minimize the power of enemy anti-aircraft fire, the speed of the aircraft during dive attacks had to be as fast as possible. However, the higher the speed of the aircraft's dive, the greater the height above the ground at which the aircraft began its dive. Therefore, the mechanism of the dive bomber had to be exceptionally ingenious to be effective. After the concentrated efforts of several experts and thousands of hours of meticulous design, the first prototype aircraft could be manufactured. After countless people and countless hours of work and research, it was gradually improved, striving for excellence to achieve perfection. Before it reached perfection, the designers encountered various theoretical and practical difficulties, almost leading to failure. Some even had doubts, believing that success was unlikely. Fortunately, the authorities had a firm will, spared no expense, and were not afraid of sacrifice. Trial after trial, improvement after improvement, although the consumption was large and the time was long, they were finally able to create an ideal dive bomber, opening a new era in the history of aircraft manufacturing, which is truly commendable. During the Spanish Civil War, the JU87 bomber had the opportunity to participate in the war for the first time, testing its edge, and it was indeed a resounding success. The results of the war showed that the power of the dive bomber no longer required major modifications in terms of mechanism.</p>
<p>Mr. Pohlmann finally stated that after several years of experimentation and sacrifice, Germany was able to achieve outstanding results with its dive bombers. Even if other countries could imitate it and catch up quickly, it would not be easy to compete with the German dive bomber. (Translated by Wang Shanshang)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Japan's Southward Ambitions Exposed; The Pacific is Not Peaceful; Japan Actively Fortifying Mandated Islands; Raising Deep Concerns Among American Authorities <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Washington: According to reliable sources, approximately 26 Japanese submarines are currently gathering in the waters of the Japanese-mandated islands in the South Seas. According to treaty stipulations, Japan must report the fortification of these mandated islands before they can be built into naval bases. However, in recent reports to the League of Nations Mandates Commission, Japan has not mentioned the presence of submarines in the South Seas. It is also reported that 150 steamships have been added to the Japanese South Seas Fleet. These steamships are well-suited for navigating the waters of the coral islands, as larger vessels cannot navigate there. Japan's southward advance coincides with recent reports from Hong Kong that "transport ships are currently moving towards Hainan Island and the Paracel and Spratly Islands." Japan began taking over the aforementioned two islands two years ago. The message also stated that Zenjiro Horikiri, a member of the Japanese House of Peers and chairman of the Tokyo Spiritual Mobilization Committee, told the directors of his committee, "Japan will take drastic measures in the South Pacific after the Democratic National Convention in the United States." These words are sufficient to prove that reports of Japanese military operations in the mandated island areas and off the coast of Vietnam are not false. It is widely believed that the activity of Japanese destroyers off the coast of Vietnam and this new information have caused American naval officers to pay close attention to the Japanese naval exercises between Hawaii and the Philippines. At the same time, the US federal authorities on the Pacific coast stated that there have been more than 200 cases of false registration of Japanese fishing boats in Southern California. Although US law does not prohibit the employment of Japanese sailors, the registered vessels must be wholly owned by Americans. The US Navy is also paying close attention to reports of Japanese fishing boats fishing for the first time in the Aleutian waters since 1938. There are currently at least nine Japanese ships and one ship, the "Totunan Maru" of 1,000 tons, anchored in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Everyone is also paying close attention to the remarks made by the former Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshisaburo Nomura. He recently returned to Yokohama yesterday after a month-long trip to the South Seas and the Philippines. He said, "I believe that it is essential to move a large number of Japanese people to the South and develop industries there." (Eleventh International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Philippine President Leans Towards Dictatorship to Cope with Serious Situation; Americans Comment Profusely <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Manila: Philippine democracy, which has been under American political guidance for the past 41 years, was thrown out the window yesterday when the Philippine Congress complied with President Quezon's demand for emergency powers. The Philippine Congress passed an emergency defense bill yesterday, granting the Philippine President various dictatorial powers. Despite fierce criticism from all sides, accusing the Philippine President of leaning towards dictatorship, the Philippine Congress passed the bill without debate, by a vote of 62 to 1. The bill gives President Quezon absolute control over public and private affairs, such as the disposition of all labor, confiscation of private property, takeover of any industry to ensure continued production, and control of all prices. Although President Quezon concealed his ambition, saying that he was revising democracy to make it more suitable for coping with the current world situation, he has actually openly declared to the world that he not only wants to be a de facto dictator, but also wants to be crowned with the name "dictator." (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Last night, prominent members of Congress here publicly commented on the Philippine Congress's decision to grant the Philippine President dictatorial powers. Many people paid close attention to the Philippine President's request for these dictatorial powers. Senator William King said that he believed that many members of Congress would want to know more details about the Philippine President's request, and once they learned the details, they might not be able to make a favorable judgment. William King pointed out that the Filipinos are currently suffering from various economic difficulties caused by the European war and feel that the Japanese are clearly trying to expand their influence in the Philippines. Philippine President Quezon's request for dictatorial powers may be due to these circumstances. Representative Crawford, a Republican from Michigan, condemned the actions of the Philippine Congress. Crawford said, "Philippine President Quezon's actions are unilateral. We should ask him to repeal these dictatorial powers. The content and spirit of the Philippine Constitution and the Independence Act are that the island should adopt our country's democratic form of government." Crawford believes that the Philippine President's dictatorial powers violate the Independence Act and the Philippine Constitution, but Crawford also said that he does not believe that the United States will take any action on this. Some people also believe that the Philippine President's request may be due to Japan's expansion plans. These people also cited news from Tokyo about the former Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura's visit to the Philippines. The news quoted a statement in a Japanese newspaper saying that Nomura strongly advocated the need for Japan to adopt a plan to move a large number of Japanese people south. The "Washington Daily News" wrote that whether President Quezon's emergency powers bill violates the spirit of the country's constitution and the Independence Act is a real question. "In any case, we have now witnessed the spectacle of a country that demanded independence because it was capable of self-government, and then turned to totalitarianism before independence was even completed. President Quezon has said that he opposes dictatorship, but at a time when democracy is being embraced, he has asked Congress to grant him absolute power. In the future, the Philippine President may ask Congress to increase his power further due to the world situation and the serious situation in the Philippines. From this point of view, President Quezon's enthusiasm for democracy is not very high." Other Washington newspapers did not comment. (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Moscow: The "Red Star" newspaper today published a commentary titled "America and the European War," stating, "The United States is currently preparing for war with increasing urgency. This can be proved by the arms plans, universal conscription, the increase of the standing army to 1.2 million people, and the huge military budget. The Pacific conference is the most obvious evidence of America's movements. The purpose of the conference is not to defend the British, French, and Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere, but to seize these territories. The only magic weapon for America to conceal its preparations for war is slogans such as "Assisting Britain." Regarding Anglo-American common interests, the Anglo-American newspapers spare no effort to promote them. Although this kind of unity is actually fabricated, in fact, the contradictions between Britain and the United States in Europe have become more acute. The United States is now beginning systematic actions to drive competitors out of the Latin American market, and the so-called competitor is actually Britain. American imperialism is very worried about the future of Britain. The United States hopes that the British can persist in the war, so that the United States can concentrate its forces. Currently, the decisive stage has not been reached in Europe, and the belligerent countries still have sufficient strength, so the United States is eager for the war to be prolonged, so that the United States can prepare for war. The contradictions between Britain and the United States in the Pacific should also be noted. In view of past experience, the United States will probably not carry out direct military intervention until the final stage of the war." (Eleventh TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>Portsmouth: President Roosevelt arrived here yesterday morning by special train to inspect the naval shipyards that are under construction after being approved by Congress under the national defense program. After the inspection, the President boarded the yacht "Potomac" and sailed to Boston, where he inspected the naval shipyards there yesterday afternoon. Secretary of the Navy Knox, Massachusetts Senator Walsh, and Secretary of Commerce Hopkins accompanied the President. As the President passed through here, sailors in white uniforms lined up to salute. Ten submarines are currently under construction there, and two more have been approved by Congress but have not yet begun construction. The President's inspection also included the US Army's giant gunpowder factory in Ward, near Boston. Afterwards, the President issued a statement saying that the United States is finally putting all its efforts into reorganizing its military. He predicted that by autumn, the naval shipyards and army factories will be able to produce at full capacity. He said, "The fact proves that we are finally moving forward. I am very satisfied with what I have seen. I hope that by autumn, the naval shipyards and army factories will be able to produce at full capacity, because the cheapest way to manufacture munitions is to produce at full capacity. If we can continue in this way, we can save countless money." After issuing the statement, President Roosevelt boarded the yacht again and cruised along the coast of New England. Before Sunday morning, he will inspect the naval station, torpedo factory, and the newly proposed naval base worth US$8 million in Narragansett Bay. At the same time, he will also inspect the main naval base in New England. (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>London, In the past 24 hours, the British Air Force bombed military targets in Germany and German-occupied areas, dropping many tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs. The scale of this attack was unprecedented since the start of the war. The bombed targets included oil pools in Vlissingen, the German seaplane base in Lister, the munitions factory in Cologne, the Ruhr railway transportation, the Schiphol aerodrome, and airfields in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The Air Ministry's information office described the situation of the British aircraft attacking the Guernsey airfield, currently occupied by the Germans, yesterday afternoon, stating: A British medium bomber was prevented from flying to France to bomb the main target, so it turned to Guernsey to search for other targets. Seeing forty or fifty fighters, bombers, and transport planes on the ground, it immediately dropped bombs. One bomb hit a giant transport plane. The planes near the hangar were likely also damaged. The British planes then flew low and strafed the artillery positions around the airfield. Soon a large number of British planes arrived and launched a concentrated and fierce bombing in three waves. After a few minutes, the airfield was covered in white smoke, and a large fire broke out. A wisp of black smoke rose as high as a thousand feet. Also, Coastal Command aircraft, taking advantage of the bright moonlight, flew to Vlissingen and bombed the oil pools despite the searchlights and intense anti-aircraft fire. Many bombs hit, causing a large fire. A squadron of medium bombers suddenly attacked a German seaplane base near Bylster, dropping bombs on more than ten medium seaplanes and a large hangar. Thick smoke was seen rising. On Friday night, British heavy bombers heavily bombed the munitions factories in Ruissiesheim and Cologne. From 10:45 PM, large numbers of British planes continuously attacked the Cologne munitions factory until nearly midnight, dropping about fifteen tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs. The targeted area caught fire within fifteen minutes. The British planes that arrived later used the firelight to find their targets and bombed again. A German fighter attempted to intercept a British plane but was driven away by gun fire. The Ruissiesheim munitions factory was also repeatedly bombed by British planes. The factory area was hit by giant bombs, causing explosions and large fires. Other targets such as railway transportation in the Ruhr and airfields in Germany and the Netherlands were also bombed and caught fire. After the Schiphol aerodrome in Amsterdam was attacked, there were continuous explosions and fires in many places. All the British planes that participated in the above-mentioned attacks throughout the night returned safely, except for one coastal plane that was routinely dispatched for patrol and was lost.

<p>Berlin, The most important news this week is that British merchant ships and foreign ships transporting for Britain have been sunk, reaching 5 million tons. In other words, only half of the ships are still existing. Newly built ships can only supplement a small portion. What Britain is most concerned about is the sharp increase in shipwrecks in the past three weeks, which shows that Germany's operations from Norway to the Spanish sea have had great results. Trade on the east coast of Britain has completely stopped. Business at the commercial ports in the English Channel will soon end. The west coast is also gradually being attacked by the German Air Force. The blockade of all of Britain is becoming increasingly tight. However, Germany is not only focusing on the trade war against Britain. A full-scale attack on Britain is about to begin. In the air battle over the English Channel on the 8th, Britain lost 72,000 tons of merchant ships and 49 aircraft, while Germany lost 10 aircraft. In addition, British seaports, shipyards, airfields, and munitions factories are being bombed and destroyed daily. British naval ports in the Mediterranean, such as Malta, Gibraltar, Alexandria, and Haifa, are being attacked by Italian planes every day, suffering heavy losses. The British fleet is no longer able to significantly harm Italian transport to and from North Africa. The British army in North Africa has now taken a defensive posture, and the Italian army has taken the lead. The Italian army's occupation of Qira poses a major threat to British supplies passing through the Red Sea. From there, it is only a half-hour flight to attack the port of Aden. The Italian Air Force now has an advantage. British shipping in the Suez Canal will suffer greatly. The withdrawal of British troops in the Far East from Shanghai and Tianjin shows that the British Empire's predicament is not only in Europe. (Eleventh, Haimao Electric)</p>
<p>Berlin, Yesterday, the German military department issued a battle report stating that the German Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights along the southeast coast of England on the 9th and at night. In the east, German planes flew over Newcastle and north of the Shetland Islands. German planes attacked the shipyards of Haines and Chatham yesterday. The searchlights and anti-aircraft guns of the enemy in those three places were destroyed by bombs dropped by German aircraft. Many ships under repair in Newcastle were also hit and destroyed by bombs. When German planes attacked the aircraft factory in Rochester, no anti-aircraft guns were fired on the coast or in the factory. The lack of anti-aircraft defense at such an important factory shows that Britain has a more urgent need for anti-aircraft guns elsewhere. In addition, an explosives manufacturing factory in Kent was also bombed. From the flames and explosions seen, it can be seen that a large amount of explosives and raw materials were destroyed. Since the start of the war, German anti-aircraft guns have shot down a total of 1,500 enemy aircraft, not counting those shot down by the army and navy. Army anti-aircraft gun teams shot down a total of 350 aircraft, and the navy shot down 150 aircraft, for a total of 2,000 enemy aircraft shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. (Eleventh, Haimao Electric)</p>
<p>Berlin, The German Navy intensified its attacks on British ships in the past week, and the Air Force also attacked British convoys. In the week ending on the 10th of this month, British ships lost 215,693 tons, of which 97,693 tons were sunk by submarines, 30,000 tons sunk abroad, 17,000 tons sunk by torpedo boats, and 71,000 tons sunk by the Air Force. German aircraft laid mines in British ports, sinking many ships. According to the German High Command, since the outbreak of the European War, Britain has lost 5,000,000 tons of ships, and the damaged ships are not included. Currently, Britain is isolated from the European continent and must import supplies from more distant locations, and the lack of ships is becoming increasingly apparent. Rommell's submarine sunk twelve armed merchant ships totaling 74,300 tons in two voyages, and also sank the British destroyer "Whirlwind" and a submarine. German torpedo boats sank three ships totaling 17,000 tons late on the 7th of this month. The German Air Force sank twelve ships totaling 55,000 tons on the 7th of this month, and seven ships were damaged by bombing. According to the Italian military report, the Italian destroyer "Val First" (1,600 tons) sank the British submarine "Awa Te" (2,000 tons). The torpedoes of the British submarine failed to hit the Italian ship. After the British fleet sailed out of Gibraltar, it was detected by Italian reconnaissance aircraft, and bombers attacked it. The British battleship "Resolution" caught fire after being bombed, and another destroyer was damaged. The Italian Air Force also sank two ships in a convoy in the eastern Mediterranean and damaged another ship. (Eleventh, Haimao Electric)</p>

<p>This correspondence is written by Demarce Bess, a special correspondent stationed in Europe for the American Saturday Evening Post. It is based on reliable reports and explains the process of Hitler's final decision. Now, it is translated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After Hitler's elite troops descended from the sky into Belgium and the Netherlands, the so-called "Phony War" in Europe was transformed into a full-scale war. From September of last year to May of this year, the belligerent countries were all cautious and prudent in their operations. The reporter had personally inspected the front and rear of the belligerent countries for several months at that time and knew that the soldiers and civilians of the belligerent and neutral countries were a little impatient with this strange and dull Phony War. Who would have known that Hitler would make a surprising move, and the Phony War would turn into a full-scale war? Although the situation was extremely terrible, the morale and public sentiment of various countries were boosted. The reason for this is nothing more than that Europeans would rather resolve a fight as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, what is the reason for this sudden change in the nature of the European War? Was this change entirely initiated by the German side? If so, was Hitler already prepared? Did he plan to launch a full-scale war only after eight months of the Phony War? Or did something happen inside or outside Germany that caused him to change his war plan?</p>
<p>We know that the German General Staff had already decided on the Western Front's war plan. Key figures of the National Socialist Party told visitors from various countries after the outbreak of the war last fall that their preparation was to concentrate all their efforts on dealing with Britain. Looking back now, the German side's various actions within eight months seem to have been carried out according to this policy. In these eight months, they can be said to have been preparing for a full-scale war at all times, and this full-scale war finally broke out on May 10. This is an observation.</p>
<p>However, according to the conclusion I have reached after studying various evidence, the above statement is actually seemingly correct but actually wrong. I know for sure that Hitler's order for the Western Front's general offensive was a temporary notice to the General Staff. The General Staff had indeed carefully formulated the Western Front's war plan in advance, as in other combat areas, but according to reliable reports, they did not receive notice of when and where to launch a blitzkrieg until a few days before the operation.</p>
<p>At the end of April, I met a certain important person in Rome who was closely associated with the German General Staff. The German General Staff had talked to him freely about their goals and hopes over the years, without any concealment. When I met him in Rome, I told him that I was going to the Netherlands to gather news. He asked in surprise: "Why are you going to the Netherlands? Nothing will happen there." This is also enough to prove that Hitler's order for the Western Front's general offensive was a temporary decision.</p>
<p>In Europe, May Day is not only a flower festival but also Europe's Labor Day, which is an important day of the year for European socialists. But as far as I know, this year's May Day was actually the day when Hitler finally decided to implement the world's big gamble.</p>
<p>We also remember that the Allied forces withdrew from central Norway on May Day. This action had a greater impact in Germany than in other countries. It fundamentally resolved the inconsistent disputes between the German party, government, and military authorities since the outbreak of the war eight months ago. The National Socialist Party's extremists finally prevailed with their "winner takes all" slogan. To understand the significant impact of the Scandinavian adventure on German policy, we should trace back to the first few days of the outbreak of the European War. It is generally acknowledged that the declaration of war by Britain and France against Germany last September was unexpected by the German National Socialist Party leaders. They expected that Britain and France would never fight for the Polish issue.</p>
<p>However, Britain and France declared war after all, and the National Socialist Party had to reassess its position. Hitler also immediately convened all his advisers to discuss countermeasures. His attitude at that time seemed extremely frank and unbiased, because his planned plan had been shattered by the unexpected actions of Britain and France. At that time, the advice given to Hitler was obviously divided into two factions. One faction, including army officers and economic experts, believed that since Germany had obtained the support of the Soviet Union, it could be confident of winning the war against the blockade. They also believed that the National Socialist Party's Germany was more organized and suitable for a long-term war than the European democracies. Britain and France had not yet organized a sound general mobilization for a long time, and a long-term war would bankrupt both morale and economy. However, in such a war, Germany should preserve its war power, even if there were no more large-scale military attacks like Poland. In short, Germany should not risk a full-scale war to achieve victory. They also said that the Phony War could confuse the sympathy of countries sympathetic to Britain and France (especially the United States) and prevent them from joining the enemy camp.</p>
<p>This was a well-reasoned argument, and Hitler seemed to have been influenced by it for a period of time. However, this argument was opposed by the National Socialist Party's extremists who advocated a full-scale war. This faction believed that the European democracies were extremely corrupt and could be overthrown with a single blow. Germany should not hesitate any longer but should immediately launch a full-scale war against Britain and France.</p>
<p>This faction constantly advised Hitler. Hitler was also a person who liked to take risks. However, in September last year, the National Socialist Party's extremists did not fully gain his favor. They had assured Hitler that Britain and France would not fight for Poland. As a result, their intelligence proved to be completely inaccurate. The other faction's argument, although not very pleasing to the ear, was more reliable.</p>
<p>The two factions were initially evenly matched and both had an impact on Hitler, but at this time, the National Socialist Party dictator was in a dilemma and did not indicate which policy to adopt.</p>
<p>According to secret news obtained by the reporter in Rome, Hitler decided to take action in Scandinavia two days before meeting with Mussolini at the Brenner Pass. He arranged that meeting to inform Mussolini of his prepared plan and to request him to also take a diversionary action in the Mediterranean. Mussolini accepted this proposal and played it very skillfully, deceiving everyone except for a few sharp-eyed residents of Rome.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Scandinavian war became the final test of strategic strength between the two factions in Germany. If the National Socialist Party's military action in Norway failed, the Phony War would undoubtedly continue to be prolonged. However, the invasion of Norway actually achieved unprecedented success, and the National Socialist Party's extremists gained the upper hand in Berlin. Hitler changed his course upon seeing the wind, and it is an undeniable fact that he immediately launched a full-scale war elsewhere.</p>
<p>The occupation of Norway also changed Italy's attitude in every way, just like the rest of Europe. After hearing about the success of the German invasion of Norway, the fascist dictator Mussolini completely changed his political position. This means that he knew that the Phony War was over, and the full-scale war had taken its place. The only question was whether the full-scale war could be resolved quickly. As far as Italy is concerned, Italy does not have a large amount of money to buy the necessary military supplies in the war. However, Mussolini has repeatedly declared that he is determined to play a role before the end of this war. Once the end is near, he will rise up and join the war.</p>
<p>During the first ten days of May, Europe presented a special calm. Europeans seemed to be enjoying the beautiful scenery of spring. On May 10, a day that occupies an important page in history, the reporter was awakened by the air raid siren in Paris at five o'clock in the morning. By seven o'clock, the alarm was lifted, and the reporter went to the streets to inspect the French people's reaction to Germany's blitzkrieg attack on Holland, Belgium, and France that night. That morning, the air in Paris was not as excited as it was on Sunday morning in September of last year when Britain and France declared war on Germany. Eight months of waiting made a big difference. The French all felt the seriousness of the situation but were not as dumbfounded as they were in September of last year. The gas masks that had been attracting attention for a long time were rarely worn. The children who had evacuated last fall were also playing indifferently in the park.</p>
<p>The French had already won the Phony War. When they heard Hitler order his troops to invade Holland and Belgium, they shrugged and smiled. In the eyes of the French, the National Socialist Party's dictator was still a ridiculous object, especially when the French read his boast: "The war launched today will determine the fate of the German nation for the next thousand years." Hitler at that time obviously regarded himself as a greater Napoleon. The National Socialist Party's extremists had already achieved their wish. The success of the Norwegian military operation created Hitler's confidence that he could be invincible.</p>
<p>Once the German troops occupied the three countries of Holland, Belgium, and France, Hitler and his party had no turning back. They would either be defeated and lose everything, or they would win and realize their grand plan.</p>

<h3 id="e46">After the British Troops Withdraw, the US Troops Will Shoulder the Heavy Responsibility - 700 US Soldiers from Honolulu Will Come to Shanghai - Shanghai Defense Military Conference May Not Be Held <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 10th), it was heard from reliable sources that the British troops stationed in Shanghai, including the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment, the 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, and the Army Medical Corps, will be transferred to British Somaliland in East Africa. However, this statement has not been officially confirmed. It is said that the above two battalions will depart at any time after preparations are completed. The British military hospital on Central Road will withdraw first with the medical corps.</p>
<p>Troops stationed in Peiping and Tientsin will come to Shanghai first</p>
<p>The British military headquarters announced yesterday that all outstanding debts of the British troops stationed in Shanghai must be settled within a week, which proves that the British troops will be transferred at any time. A telegram from Peiping said that 50 British troops stationed there and 150 British troops stationed in the British Concession in Tientsin, all belonging to the East Surrey Regiment, will depart for Hong Kong within a week. This statement could not be confirmed. It is expected that this batch of British troops will arrive in Shanghai first with the military nursing team and belong to the East Surrey Regiment. The Allied News Agency in Hong Kong reported that although there is no sign of where the British troops withdrawing from North China and Central China will go, Hong Kong expects that these British troops will go to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>US troop takeover not yet announced</p>
<p>As for who will take over the defense area of the British troops stationed in Shanghai, people in the city have made various speculations. It is generally believed that the western district patrolled by the East Surrey Regiment will be taken over by the US 4th Marine Regiment. However, the official province has said that it has not heard of anything. The US military headquarters in Shanghai announced yesterday that regarding the withdrawal of British troops or the takeover of any area by US troops, the US military will not make any statements until Colonel Baker, the commander of the 4th Marine Regiment, officially announces it. However, there is no sign of when Colonel Baker will announce it.</p>
<p>US troops will bear the entire responsibility</p>
<p>In addition, the Allied News Agency in Honolulu telegraphed that about 700 US sailors have departed from there to Shanghai to strengthen the strength of the US troops stationed there. It is not possible to confirm the claim that this batch of US soldiers was sent to protect British interests. It was rumored yesterday that the commanders of the military forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai may hold a meeting at the beginning of next week to revise the defense areas of the military forces of the Public Concession. However, some people believe that this meeting may not be held because after the British troops withdraw, Shanghai will only have US, Japanese, and Italian troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The activities of the Japanese troops are limited to the north of the Suzhou River, and the Italian troops may also withdraw soon. Therefore, the entire heavy burden will be placed on the shoulders of the US troops. It is said that the British troops stationed in Shanghai who have family members residing in Shanghai have received notices to prepare for the departure of their family members themselves. However, the exact nature of this instruction is still unknown. The English-language Great American Weekly published an article by Woodhead, a well-known British commentator in this city, commenting on the impending withdrawal of the British defense forces from Shanghai. The article mentioned that the Japanese government had proposed and the pseudo "Mayor of Shanghai" had requested the British defense forces to withdraw from Shanghai. However, this proposal or request is completely unrelated to this decision of the British government. According to Woodhead's guess, this withdrawal is completely determined based on military needs.</p>
<p>The task of the defense forces is to maintain law and order</p>
<p>Three years after the Shanghai War, the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai cooperated with the French, American, and Italian defense forces and the Shanghai Municipal Council police to maintain the law and order of the Public Concession and the designated areas of the extended roads. If the normal situation and freedom of entry and exit in the city are fully restored, the need for the above-mentioned defense forces to perform security duties will no longer exist. The continued military occupation of the Hongkou district and the surrounding suburbs by the Japanese is the only reason why the defense forces cannot withdraw. The task of the British defense forces is only in terms of security, which is not as important as the task of the British domestic military.</p>
<p>The US troop takeover is the most popular</p>
<p>The total number of British defense forces is only over 2,000 (actually only over 1,500). If the Japanese decide to invade the British defense area, they will not be able to provide effective resistance. Moreover, Britain currently needs to strengthen its military forces in various parts of the empire. Therefore, the withdrawal of the defense forces stationed in Shanghai cannot be said to be inappropriate. However, we cannot admit that this move will cause a serious reaction from all sectors of the city. At the same time, we cannot but pay attention to the fact that if the US Marine Corps cannot take over the British defense area, the security and administration of the concession will be seriously infringed.</p>
<p>Britain pays attention to the safety of Singapore</p>
<p>The British in this city must regard the withdrawal of the British defense forces as an unpleasant sacrifice made by Britain due to the current European War. Now that the European War is in full swing, and Hong Kong and Singapore are threatened, Shanghai seems to be less important. Therefore, all sectors of society must regard the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai as a military need action, because Britain needs more troops elsewhere. The US government's attention to the safety of Hong Kong and Singapore is not as concerned as the British side. Then we hope that the US authorities will expand the measures to maintain law and order in Shanghai, which is not an extravagant hope.</p>

<p>Since the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China announced the blockade of the Zhejiang-Fujian coast on July 15, third-country shipping merchants operating merchant ships in Zhejiang and Fujian have been forced to stop sailing. They have requested the consuls of the respective countries stationed in Shanghai to negotiate, but to no avail. In order to maintain the shipping industry, they have had to send ships to try to sail to various small ports. Now, the commander of the fleet has announced the expansion of the Fujian sea blockade line. It is said that the Japanese Consulate has notified the consulates and Jianghai Customs of various countries stationed in Shanghai that it will be implemented from 0:00 AM on the 15th of this month. The impact on the shipping industry of various countries to China is becoming increasingly heavy.</p>
<p>Guluo Sailing</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the shipping industry yesterday that after the Changde Wheel of the Italian merchant Luo Kezhi Shipping Company was released and arrived at Guluotou, the Hana Wheel of the German Far East Company sailed from Shanghai with cargo and passengers to Guluotou. In addition, the Moufu Wheel of the German Lihuo Shipping Company also sailed to Guluo. However, foreign ships sailing to Guluotou must have their cargo and passengers inspected by the local garrison upon arrival. Passengers must have proof of identity, and cargo is limited to necessities. Passengers and merchants should pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>Xingquan Shipping</p>
<p>The ships of the British Yi Long Company mainly operate along the coast of Fujian Province. Since Japan expanded the blockade of the Fujian coast, Xinghua and Quanzhou have been included in the no-sail list. In order to avoid danger, there are no ships sailing to Fujian for the time being. The manager of the company is considering remedies. As for the ships docked in Xinghua, they are the Shenyou. After the goods are unloaded, they will sail back to Shanghai. It is said that the Maler Wheel of the British merchant代理, which is代理 by Fusheng Company, also has no ships sailing to Yihua and Quanzhou at present.</p>
<p>Songmen Route</p>
<p>The Anli Wheel of the Italian merchant, which is 代理 by Tongtai Bank, has sailed from Shanghai to Songmen the day before yesterday and has suspended Jianwanli Port, Chuanshan and Cenggang. It is also said that Japanese warships are patrolling the ocean surface along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian from time to time and use flags to inquire about or detain and inspect merchant ships coming and going. The ships sailing to various locations often cannot arrive at their destinations on the scheduled date. In the future, in order to avoid attention, the sailing date and destination of each ship sailing along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian may be kept secret temporarily.</p>

<p>All postal staff of all levels, upper, middle, and lower, of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its affiliated branches, previously requested the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union to submit a request to Director Zha Peilin to ask the authorities to grant an appropriate living allowance in order to maintain their livelihoods due to the rising prices and difficult living conditions. Director Zha once submitted this to the Ministry of Communications for approval of the allowance. However, due to the obstruction of transportation in various places and the inconvenience of sending telegrams in the event of danger, no concrete solution was obtained. A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from relevant sources yesterday that when Zha flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing, he reported on the postal situation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai and also raised the issue of living allowances for employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration. The authorities approved it and decided to implement it from June of this year. It is said that senior postal staff will receive a discretionary allowance of 25%, and the middle and lower levels will receive a uniform allowance of 75%. The June and July payments have already been paid on a monthly basis. The August payments will be issued separately on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e49">A Brief History of the British in Shanghai <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The British Army in North China, the Douhan Team, withdrew from Tianjin at the end of December last year. The British government has now decided to continue to withdraw its troops from Shanghai and North China. The order was officially announced the day before yesterday afternoon. The British authorities have not announced the destination of the withdrawal. However, general observations indicate that it will not be beyond the scope of British territories in the Far East.</p>
<p>Regarding the number of British troops stationed in Shanghai during their stay, the number once increased to 20,000 in the 16th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition and first arrived in Shanghai. In order to protect the Public Concession, the British authorities ordered the Coldstream Guards, led by Viscount Gort, the current British Army Inspector-General, to come to Shanghai to strengthen the defense.</p>
<p>The first time the British troops came to Shanghai was after the Opium War in 1842. At that time, Shanghai had been opened as a commercial port due to treaty relations. The British troops, under the command of Colonel Montgomerie, arrived in Shanghai directly by ship. Their mission in Shanghai was only to protect the Public Concession.</p>
<p>From 1856 to 1860, the Small Sword Society and the Taiping Army successively rebelled. The British and French allied forces took joint action in Shanghai to show resistance. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps also rose up to guard the defense area. At that time, the number of British and French allied forces in Shanghai was only 2,814. In 1862, Ward was killed, and the allied forces finally defeated the Taiping Army in 1864, creating a page in today's history.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the British authorities increased their strength and dispatched 3,000 Indian troops from Hong Kong to Shanghai for stationing. The merchant groups and their troops serving in Shanghai from Britain, France, Germany, and Japan were also mobilized to station in the Shanghai area. They were led by Mr. Cley, the commander of the British Army and the Fire Department. After 190, the foreign troops began to withdraw. The defense of the Shanghai Concession was maintained by the merchant group and the Marine Corps, maintaining good order. This continued for several years until 1911 to 1913, when they卸仔肩. From 1924, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was responsible for protecting the security of the concession.</p>
<p>When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in 1927, the British, American, French, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish authorities successively stepped up the dispatch of their troops to the Far East. The Coldstream Guards of Viscount Gort of the British Army also came to Shanghai at this time. June 3 was the birthday of King George of England. The Coldstream Guards held a grand review on the racecourse on that day.</p>
<p>Since then, the British troops have been stationed in Shanghai for a long time. Their number is 1,570, including the West Yorkshire Regiment and the East Surrey Regiment. The weapon equipment is complete. The current commander-in-chief is Major General Simmons. The commander of the West Yorkshire Regiment is Colonel R.A.Wolfe Murray, and the commander of the East Surrey Regiment is Colonel G.E. Swinton. (Quan)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Tomorrow's Songhu Anti-Japanese War Memorial, Special Tension in Defense, Steadfast Will of All Circles, Calm Attitude, Temporary Interruption of Water Traffic <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the third anniversary of the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day. Due to the special environment, various circles in Shanghai will not hold commemorative ceremonies. However, they will remain silent and solemn, stop entertainment and banquets, and voluntarily observe vegetarianism for a day to mourn the martyrs and the deceased compatriots. They will also raise funds to send winter clothes, and do their part to save the country and complete the great cause of resisting aggression and national reconstruction. The business community has specified commemorative methods: (1) The city's business community has decided to voluntarily stop entertainment and banquets and observe vegetarianism for one day tomorrow; (2) Tomorrow at 12 noon, all industries and businesses should remain silent for three minutes to express their deep condolences to the soldiers who died on the front line and the compatriots who suffered in the rear; (3) The business community has decided to promote donation campaigns for disaster relief and various activities of "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" with resolute actions to commemorate the arrival of this great festival; (4) Send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express respect.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Alert Has Become More Stringent</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day after the implementation of martial law in Shanghai. The alert situation has become more stringent than the previous two days. From 5 am yesterday, all armed members of the A Company and B Company of the Chinese Corps of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps were ordered to assemble and take on alert duties, with each shift lasting two hours. The patrol car team also dispatched armed Russian team members and Scottish team members to patrol the streets from yesterday morning. The number of US, French, and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai has also increased, patrolling the streets in groups or stationed at gaps in the blockade line. The inspection of pedestrians and vehicles entering and exiting is also more strict. According to yesterday's situation, Shanghai has actually formed a solid armed fortress, with thorough defenses, even more so than in past memorial days. The Public Concession Police Department has completed the construction of sandbag bunkers in front of Chinese and foreign newspaper offices along the Bund, Avenue Edward VII, and Hankou Road overnight, guarded by the Volunteer Corps and the defense forces, and equipped with machine guns. More Chinese and foreign detectives have been dispatched to guard the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Stopping Entertainment and Closing Early</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of special alert. Except for the discovery of hand grenades by the Central Police Station, everything else remained calm. Although it was Sunday, the internal staff of the police departments of the two concessions usually took a holiday. However, due to the special alert, the staff in the offices of the police departments of the two concessions were also ordered to work as usual. The headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps also did not take a holiday. In addition, the English, American, French, and Italian defense forces were also prohibited from soldiers going out for entertainment, even on their regular Sunday holidays. Furthermore, the authorities of the two concessions, considering that tomorrow is the "August 13th" Memorial Day and that entertainment venues are crowded with tourists, have issued separate orders to various amusement venues through the police department to suspend business for one day tomorrow. In addition, most theaters will also voluntarily suspend performances for one day, but some movie theaters may still be open. Other places such as dance halls and bars have also been ordered to close early and prohibit all-night business.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Blockade, Extremely Strict Mail Inspection</p>
<p>It is rumored that traffic on the Huangpu River will also be completely blockaded starting tomorrow. At that time, ferries operating on the South Huangpu, Tangkou, Wangjiadu, Zhagang, Dujiahang, Yexie, Minhang, and Zhuqing lines will all be suspended. Waterway traffic in the upstream of the Suzhou River, including Beixinjing and Yujidun, will also be blockaded starting tomorrow. No ships will be allowed to enter or exit. Therefore, it is feared that all inland river ferries will be suspended starting tomorrow. The Maqi South Road Post Office has recently intensified its inspection of various mails due to the approaching August 13th Songhu Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day. Even printed matter is being opened for inspection, and extreme attention is being paid to mailboxes. The number of inspectors has also been increased daily. This tense atmosphere is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Exercises, Japanese Soldiers Parade</p>
<p>Starting from midnight on the 10th, the Japanese Marines held a large-scale offensive and defensive exercise in the Zhabei area. At that time, they were divided into two teams, Team A, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tomonari, used the area north of Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road, and Jiangwan Road as its base. Team B, commanded by Commander Shikaki, advanced from the Guangzhong Road Bayuqiao area. All units of the Marine Corps participated in the exercise, and the artillery team fired until dawn yesterday. During the exercise, important Japanese military personnel, including the commander of the Japanese army in Shanghai, Higuchi, and the commander of the Marine Corps, Takeda, participated. Yesterday, Sunday, a batch of Japanese army troops transferred from the inland to Shanghai in Zhabei, divided into teams of more than ten people each, all wearing yellow uniforms, paraded unarmed in the Public Concession, passing through North Henan Road, the south of the Ball Field, South Road, Zhejiang Road, and returning after circling north for a week.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Germany and Japan's Positions in the Far East Determined to Be Difficult to Coordinate, Germany's Bloodshed in Europe Cannot Allow Japan to Profit, The Prosperity of Sino-German Trade Depends on China's Victory <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Since Yosuke Matsuoka took office as Foreign Minister of Japan, he has announced the "East Asia Economic Sphere", which not only includes China, but also the Nanyang regions such as Annam and the Dutch East Indies. However, news from neutral countries in Geneva all pointed out Germany's view that European colonies should belong to Europe. The Far East interests of Germany and Japan are obviously conflicting. The reporter met with a certain internationalist familiar with diplomacy and asked for his views on this matter and the intricate relationship between Sino-German-Japanese economies.</p>
<p>China Establishes a Balance of Power in Asia</p>
<p>According to him, although the Netherlands, Belgium, and France were defeated by Germany, the cultures of these countries are also very prosperous. Germany cannot diminish their countries or enslave their people, so it can only take their overseas colonies. Now that Japan has placed Annam and the Dutch East Indies under its power, the result of Germany's bloodshed has instead allowed Japan to reap the benefits. Who can be willing to accept this? Therefore, the general opinion of observers is that if Germany wins, it will definitely not ignore the Asian issue. As for the China issue, China's independence can create a balance of power in Asia, which will benefit all European and American countries. Because Britain retains vast colonies in Asia, it is willing to see China's independence as a shield for India. If Germany were in the same position as Britain, its attitude would be the same.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War Affects Germany</p>
<p>When German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk met with Fischer, the editor of the Vienna "Southeast Magazine", to discuss post-war European economic plans, he paid special attention to the East Asian and South American markets. Funk said, "The East Asian market has been greatly affected by the Sino-Japanese War. If the political situation clears up, the economic relations between Germany and China will immediately make good progress." Since the First World War, China's foreign trade has always been dominated by Japan in terms of imported goods. Since the Northern Expedition and unification of the National Government, the implementation of tariff autonomy, and active engagement in construction, a major change has taken place in China's foreign trade relations. In the past, imports were mainly Japanese cotton cloth and daily necessities. Until the Lugouqiao Incident, Germany's trade with China could compete with Japan.</p>
<p>If Japan Wins, Germany Will Inevitably Suffer Losses</p>
<p>In 1937, German goods imported were 64,399,884 gold units, and Japanese goods imported were 66,098,122 gold units. In recent years, due to Japan's control of most of China's territory, its trade with China has seen exclusive progress. For example, in 1939, Japanese goods imported into China rose to 126,555,744 gold units, while German goods fell to 35,552,680 gold units. Since German goods imported into China are mostly machinery, military equipment, and other industrial and national defense construction products, if Japan controls China, then China will be the outlet for Japanese goods, and German goods will have no foothold in China. At best, Germany's heavy industrial products can only be transported to Japan, and Japan will pay for German goods with Chinese raw materials. In this way, Germany's trade with the Far East will suffer two losses: (1) losing the Chinese market, where Germany has a trade surplus; (2) losing the opportunity to have a trade surplus with Japan and obtain foreign exchange. Therefore, whether from a political or economic point of view, China's prosperity and independence are beneficial to Germany. Recently, the Japanese have been spreading rumors that the National Government will send Zhu Jiahua to Germany, and that China will strengthen its relations with Germany. In fact, China has friendly and mutually supportive relations with all countries in the world, not just with Germany. Therefore, China will never be isolated.</p>

<p>Recently, the situation in Xiyi has suddenly become tense. The reason is that at 2 pm on the 6th, Chen Maoyong, the puppet "town head" of Dongting, was killed in Jiulian. The Yuxin Rice Mill in Changan Bridge outside the North Gate was robbed. Li Maozhao, a shop assistant at the Hengfeng Oil Mill in Bodugang outside Nandou, was kidnapped. It was discovered that a mobile team member, Zhang Yonglong (also known as Zhao Yuanliang), had obtained a pass guaranteed by Wang Yuanjuxinji Iron Workshop. The Japanese special agent chief, Komatsu Junzo, summoned the manager Guo Shuming and the apprentice Lin Shifan, who had stamped the pass, for questioning. Since then, the procedures for obtaining a passenger pass have become more complicated.</p>

<p>According to reliable information obtained by the Datong News Agency reporter from the shipping industry, around 10 am on the 10th, there were 24 Japanese planes over Ningbo, flying south in formation. They then flew south again over Ningbo County. According to general speculation, the ultimate destination of this batch of Japanese planes is no more than two places: first, flying towards Taiwan; second, flying towards Haimen, south of Shantou. The Japanese army is forcibly attempting to land in Haimen, south of Shantou, and this batch of Japanese planes may be flying to cover the landing troops.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Open Fire</p>
<p>Two Japanese warships outside Zhenhai fired two shells at the Jiangnan Fortress area at noon on the 10th. The shells passed over Jiangnan without causing any damage. The two Japanese warships then opened fire on fishing boats outside Zhenhai. It is unknown whether any fishing boats were sunk. Japanese warships are frequently patrolling the sea off eastern Zhejiang, obviously hindering navigation. Furthermore, on the 10th, the Japanese warships anchored in the Wentai waters fired at Songmen and Pingjiang. The Japanese warships anchored in the Wulongshan waters of Xiangshan Port also fired seven shells in the northwest direction.</p>
<p>Chasing Civilian Ships</p>
<p>A Japanese warship in the Hengshan waters of Xiangshan Port also fired four shells at nearby civilian ships yesterday. One civilian ship was sunk, and one was detained.

It is believed that two Koreans from the taxi company were also in the two cars of the assassins, assisting in the assassination. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese authorities went to the taxi company last week and arrested the two Koreans. However, after questioning, they believed that the Koreans were not the criminals and released them. The police department is currently fully cooperating with the Japanese authorities to continue the investigation in order to capture the Chinese perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e56">A Major Fire Occurred in Wangjia Alley, Daxilu, Yesterday Morning, More Than Ten Factories and Households Were Affected, Estimated Property Loss of Approximately 200,000 <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Wangjia Alley, Daxilu, in western Shanghai, suddenly suffered a fire at about 6:20 am yesterday, which lasted for two and a half hours. The estimated loss is more than 200,000. More than ten factories and households were affected, including the Guangya Steel Furniture Factory, which was almost completely destroyed, with losses exceeding 100,000. The details of the fire are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Careless Biscuit Shop, Fire Spreads</p>
<p>Wangjia Alley, Daxilu, belongs to the area of extra-mural roads, bordering Daxilu to the south and Yuyuan Road to the north. Its western end reaches Yidingpan Road and Zhujiabang. The street is densely populated, the market is prosperous, and there are factories and shops all around. It is a strangely developed small town. At about 6:20 am yesterday, it was suddenly visited by the fire god, and an unprecedented fire broke out. It is reported that the fire was caused by carelessness in starting a stove in a large biscuit shop. It immediately burst through the roof, and smoke filled the air. Because it was early morning, there was a lack of people to help, resulting in an uncontrollable fire.</p>
<p>Affecting Neighbors, Burning Very Fiercely</p>
<p>After the fire spread, it affected the neighboring Minhua Weaving Factory, with four storefronts on the building, as well as the Tongchang Weaving Factory and the Greater China Carpet Factory Xingyu, all of which were wooden houses. Once on fire, they were not easy to extinguish and were all reduced to ashes in a short time. It is said that the two factories were solely funded by the same boss, Zhang Xinpei, and the losses were huge, but the exact number is unknown. Neighboring No. 17 Country House, two buildings, Shikumen, and glass windows were also burned down.</p>
<p>Guangya Factory and Others Were Burned Down</p>
<p>However, the biggest loss was the Guangya Steel Furniture Factory, managed by Ningbo native Sang Damao, located behind the house at No. B60, specializing in modern sofas, beds, chairs, and sofa covers. The fire spread very fiercely, coupled with the help of the wind, making the fire raging. The area was brightly lit, and although the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, together with the Central Fire Brigade and others, drove pump trucks to try their best to rescue, the narrow roads made it difficult to get water, making rescue difficult. As a result, in a blink of an eye, the Guangya factory's manufacturing plant and warehouses were all burned down, with losses exceeding tens of thousands.</p>
<p>The Puppet Police Station Was Also Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>The police station of the puppet police bureau in Wangjia Alley, a three-room flat, was also reduced to ashes. In this fire, the houses of various factories and the property of residents were destroyed, with an estimated loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. As for the biscuit shop, the source of the fire, the culprit escaped without a trace. The fire was gradually extinguished until about 10 am.</p>
<p>Two Men and Women Were Accused of Arson</p>
<p>According to news obtained by the English Great Beauty Weekly, the above-mentioned fire is believed to have been deliberately set by a man and a woman. Currently, the two are being detained by the puppet police. When the newspaper's reporter arrived in the area, he witnessed the arrest of these two people. The woman's name is Huang Aigen (transliteration), 41 years old, and the man's name is unknown because he refused to reveal it. They were then taken to the Yidingpan Road Puppet Police Department branch and were still in detention and interrogation yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Jiuji Kimura Company Sued for Breach of Contract, The Tongue-and-Groove Wood Has Not Been Delivered, Further Trial After Investigation <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Jiuji Timber Company on Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai, a giant in Shanghai's timber industry, was recently sued by Qingdao Xin Shen Ji Construction Factory in the First Special Court for failing to deliver the goods and requesting an order to deliver the goods. Yesterday, Judge Pu Fuji heard the case. According to the plaintiff's lawyer's statement, before the August 13th War, the plaintiff had ordered more than 70,000 sheets of tongue-and-groove wood from Jiuji Timber Company, agreeing that the goods must be delivered in full by August 10th. However, after Jiuji delivered more than 30,000 sheets, the remaining 40,000 sheets were suddenly cancelled on the grounds that the original contract was cancelled and refused to be delivered. The plaintiff believed that a legal contract could only be terminated with the consent of both parties and could not be terminated by one party's unilateral declaration. After repeatedly urging the delivery of goods, the defendant refused to perform the contract, so the plaintiff filed a lawsuit requesting the court to order Jiuji to deliver the undelivered 40,000 sheets of tongue-and-groove wood (worth more than 100,000 yuan in national currency) to the plaintiff in Qingdao. Jiuji Kimura Company also hired lawyer Zuo Detao to defend, saying that the reason why the defendant could not fulfill the contract was that the tongue-and-groove wood was only produced in Japan, and it was impossible to obtain the goods after the war. Furthermore, due to the restrictions of the regulations issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the defendant could hardly fulfill the contract again, so the defendant declared the termination of the contract to the plaintiff, not intentionally refusing to deliver the goods. The plaintiff delayed the lawsuit until now after the defendant's declaration and should be dismissed. Judge Pu ruled that the case still needs to be investigated and ordered a change of date.</p>

<p>At 3:30 pm yesterday, an unnamed man, about 40 years old and resembling a worker, hired a rickshaw to Dr. Shi Xiaoshan's injury clinic at No. 50 Lane, Wufuli, Luzon Road, French Concession, because of his injuries. Unexpectedly, he collapsed and died outside Dr. Shi's clinic due to his severe injuries. Dr. Shi's clinic reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. After the investigation, the body was sent to the morgue for examination to find family members. The court will be requested to send someone to examine the body today.</p>

<p>At 6:20 am yesterday, a hand grenade was suddenly found on the sidewalk to the left of the entrance of the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road, Public Concession. At that time, Chen Guodong (23 years old), a Jiangbei native and sanitation worker of the Public Works Department, was cleaning garbage on the road there. Chen did not recognize the grenade as a dangerous item and swept the grenade into the feces bucket with a broom. Unexpectedly, with a loud bang, it exploded immediately, injuring Chen's left foot, ankle, and thigh. Afterwards, the police station called a car to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries were minor and there were no major problems. The police station is now strictly investigating the source of the hand grenade.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The First Phase of the British Overseas War Fund Exceeded the Quota, More Than £50,000, Crowded with Wartime Donations <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The original target for the British Overseas War Fund in Shanghai was set at £50,000. As of last Friday (9th), the amount raised was less than £1,000 away from the target. However, when the announcement was made at 10 am the following Saturday (10th), the target of £50,000 had been reached ahead of schedule. The closing date for the first phase of fundraising was August 15th, which was still five days away from the previous Saturday (10th). During this period, all donations exceeding £50,000 will be transferred to the second phase of the £50,000 war fund. According to senior officials serving on the fund committee, the nature of the British Overseas War Fund is very noble. All British nationals should generously donate money and contribute their efforts to the best of their ability, in line with the principle of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength."</p>
<p>The British Central War Donation Association in Shanghai held a committee meeting the day before yesterday to report on the financial situation. As of August 8th, the total amount of donations received was 1,077,773.12 yuan in Chinese currency and £18,853 2 shillings - pence in British currency. £34,329 of this amount has been remitted to the UK. The association recently received a telegram from London stating that the previous fundraising for ambulances has ended (the British community in Shanghai donated money for vehicles in June), but the rescue of hospitals and prisoners of war still depends on donations. The association has now specifically decided to donate £3,000 and remit it to London to cover the needs of hospitals and prisoners of war. It also plans to imitate the Red Cross donation box method, setting up donation boxes in various stores to collect donations from the British community.</p>
<p>Polish Army Continues to Resist</p>
<p>Recently, someone arrived in Shanghai from Europe and talked about the Polish army still continuing to fight against the German army abroad. When Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east and west, respectively, the majority of the Polish army suffered a disastrous defeat. However, many officers and soldiers used various means of transportation, experienced various dangerous situations, and finally escaped abroad. Former Polish Prime Minister Sikorski has recently trained a new army and started to fight against Germany. The new army has more than 100,000 people. The new army has repeatedly achieved miraculous feats in Norway, France, and Belgium. Before the French army was defeated, the Polish army fought bravely. At that time, the Polish army was in a difficult situation. After fighting for several days, they crossed the Swiss border. In addition to the safe escape of the soldiers, there were also tanks, heavy artillery, and wounded soldiers, all of which were transported out of France and crossed the English Channel. Currently, a part of the new army has been assisting the British in operations in Palestine, while the rest are concentrated in the United Kingdom, preparing to resist Hitler's attack.</p>
<h3 id="e62">A Wife Who Abandoned Her Husband Sues for Encroachment <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Xu Fulong (37 years old, from Yancheng), the owner of Pingjin Sanhe Lou Restaurant, across from the Great World in the French Concession, was recently sued by his divorced wife, Jiang (28 years old, from Yangzhou), through lawyer Pan Zhensheng, to the Second Special Court Criminal Division for colluding with Hu Jinli to encroach on property, requesting legal investigation. According to the indictment, the plaintiff and the first defendant, Xu Fulong, have been officially married for more than ten years. This time, due to mistakenly violating criminal law, both parties agreed to divorce. At that time, Xu was willing to give the plaintiff 800 yuan in national currency, which was collected by the second defendant, Hu Jinli, on his behalf. All clothes, including wardrobes and suitcases, were returned together, with a settlement record as proof. At that time, because the plaintiff was in criminal execution, the civil court summoned her, and the first defendant colluded with the second defendant to appear in court and told the plaintiff that as long as she explained that the above-mentioned settlement money was collected by the second defendant on his behalf, she could be released and avoid suffering imprisonment. The plaintiff was a woman and was deceived into signing. However, the plaintiff believed it to be true and hoped to be released. A settlement was reached in court, but unexpectedly, the defendants used fraudulent methods and tricked her into settling. She regretted it too late and was still taken back into custody. After serving her sentence and being released, she repeatedly urged the defendants to pay the money, but they ignored her. It is clear that the defendants colluded to encroach on property and committed the crime of Article 335 of the Criminal Law. Upon receiving the indictment, the court heard the case the day before yesterday. The plaintiff and her lawyer arrived in court and stated the previous situation. The second defendant did not arrive. The first defendant, Xu Fulong, hired lawyer Xu Wufang to argue on his behalf, saying that the money was instructed by the plaintiff to be handed over to Hu Jinli for collection when the civil court questioned him. Hu is the lover of the plaintiff's niece, A Feng, and there is a receipt as proof. The plaintiff should seek the money from Hu and has nothing to do with Xu, etc. Judge Tang verified the words and ordered a change of date to summon Hu Jinli to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Prison Factory Warden Accused of Corruption, Second Special Court Has Filed Public Prosecution <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Prison in the French Concession on Route Massenet has an attached toothbrush factory. The workers are prisoners. The prison authorities appointed Dong Henian (age 47 this year), a Shandong native, as the warden of the factory. After Dong took the position, while distributing raw materials to the prisoners, he gradually withheld more than 30 catties of pig bristles and about 400 toothbrush boards. He also ordered the prisoners to make toothbrushes for free and gradually bring them outside to sell for his own use. On the 20th of last month, Huang Yaqiang, the head guard of the prison, received a report and reported it to the warden, who sent personnel to investigate. As a result, evidence such as pig bristles and toothbrush boards were seized. Warden Zhao immediately ordered Dong to be brought to the office for interrogation. Dong, however, roared and insulted his superiors. Therefore, Warden Zhao prepared a document and sent Dong to the Second Special Court Procuratorate for investigation. After several investigations by Prosecutor Sun Wei, it was believed that the defendant Dong Henian had committed dereliction of duty and obstruction of public service under Article 131, Paragraph 1, Article 135, Paragraph 1, and Article 140, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. He has been lawfully prosecuted in the criminal division of the court. The defendant Dong Henian has now retained Zhang Danping as his defense lawyer. Liao, the head of the criminal division of the Second Special Court, has scheduled a hearing for the 13th of this month.</p>

<p>The Yiyou Society established a medical clinic a month ago to provide free physical examinations and voluntary medical treatment for colleagues in the industrial and commercial sectors. The number of people seeking treatment was very high. However, the current scale is simple and cannot meet the general needs. Ye Jun, chairman of the Welfare Committee of the Society and a doctor, and others believe that benefiting the poor and sick is the most urgent task at present. A "China Charity Hospital Plan" was drafted, which was deeply supported by Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Guan Jiong, and other celebrities. Since the establishment of the preparatory committee, the work has progressed smoothly. The hospital fund is tentatively set at 500,000 yuan. In order to actively raise funds to achieve the goal as soon as possible, yesterday, leaders from all walks of life and enthusiastic doctors were invited to a meeting. Yuan Ludeng and others automatically formed a fundraising team on the spot to raise funds separately. The hospital address is being negotiated and searched for by Ma Xieqing, Ye Jun, Hu Shi, and others.</p>

<p>Since yesterday, the high tide has been subsiding. The amount of yesterday's high tide has receded to below ten feet, with the highest being nine feet seven inches. It will continue to fall today. However, starting from the 18th of this month, the second high tide will continue, with a quantity of more than eleven feet. It will not subside until the 20th. It has been found that during the high tide period, if it encounters wind and rain, it will easily be lifted and surge onto the road, causing flooding. Therefore, riverside and low-lying roads should be paid attention to.</p>

<p>At 11 a.m. on the 9th, at the Gonghexing Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 130 Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, a fire was caused by a hired apprentice, Dong Shenhao (a 14-year-old Ningbo native), who went to the third floor to fetch firewood and accidentally knocked over a kerosene can. The kerosene flowed all over the floor and dripped into the flames of a cooking coal stove on the second floor, causing a fire immediately. Fortunately, it was quickly extinguished, and no major disaster occurred. However, old woman Chen Zhu, woman Liu Wang, and landlord Fan Hongda and his wife Fan Hua, who lived in the drunken pavilion on the third floor, jumped from the window to escape, each suffering injuries from the fall. They were sent to Guangci Hospital by the police. Chen Zhu and Liu Wang both died of serious injuries and burns without being treated. Their bodies were sent to the morgue and reported to the Second Special Court the next day to send personnel to examine them. Liu Zhixiang, the son-in-law and husband of the deceased, claimed the bodies for burial. This information has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Fan Hongda, the owner of Gonghexing, suffered minor injuries. After being bandaged in the hospital, he was discharged and returned home. However, Fan's wife, Hua (a 27-year-old Ningbo native), died of her injuries at 11 p.m. on the 10th. The hospital notified the police, who sent the hearse to the Tongren Fuyuan branch of the morgue yesterday. They will report to the court today to send personnel for inspection.</p>

<p>A gang of bandits from Jiangbei, including Xu Jinke, Yuan Yigen, Hu Guangyu, Li Shenglin, Cao Fugen, Liu Yuebao, Wu Qingshan, Yang Yaoyuan, Li Jinhua, and a woman named Wang Xu, secretly organized a bandit gang in the Public Concession to rob residents and wealthy merchants of their property. At 2:30 a.m. on the first of this month, they pre-hired a truck and parked it near No. 310 Tangshan Road. The gang used both gentle and forceful means to break into the home of Chen Jiyuan, a cloth merchant at No. 8 in the lane, climbing up from the drying platform. They searched and robbed five households of cloth, woolen blankets, clothing, and other items worth more than 7,500 yuan, loading them onto the pre-hired truck and fleeing. After the case was reported, Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended ten male and female members of the gang, including Xu Jinke, and seized a large number of stolen goods. They were sent to the First Special Court and requested to be detained. During the investigation of the case, the Chinese and Western detectives learned that between July 3 and July 14, the gang had (1) robbed the property in the bathhouse opened by Westerners at No. 18 Kunshan Road unsuccessfully, and (2) robbed leather goods worth more than 5,000 yuan from the Xieji Leather Factory at No. 1190 Connaught Road, also hiring a truck to load and escape. There are still 15 accomplices at large. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over a continued hearing. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the process and requested a postponement. When questioned, the defendants gave ambiguous statements. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Recent Work of the National Peiping Library (III) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(B) Regarding Publications</p>
<p>(1) "Overseas Catalogue of Chinese Bronze Ware." In 1936, the library was entrusted by the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee to investigate Chinese antiquities held overseas. Later, due to the Lugouqiao Incident, all progress came to a halt. Recently, the library reorganized the bronze ware section and commissioned Mr. Chen Mengjia to compile a catalogue. The first collection consists of two volumes. The upper volume contains an overview of Chinese bronze ware, a catalogue of each item, and descriptions. The lower volume is a collection of illustrations, selecting 150 items. It has been printed by the Shanghai Commercial Press using collotype. (2) "General Catalogue of Tang Tomb Inscriptions." The library's collection of rubbings of inscriptions on metal and stone is a grand sight, with tomb inscriptions being the most numerous. In recent years, stones from Luoyang Mingyou have been unearthed in increasing numbers. Not only is the literary style magnificent, but the events, official names, and place names recorded are also of great benefit to historical research. In addition to possessing a complete copy of the rubbings from Zhang's Qian Tang Zhi Zhai in Xin'an, the library has also commissioned specialists in Luoyang to continue purchasing. The collection of Tang tomb inscriptions has exceeded 3,000 types. A simplified catalogue has already been typeset and printed. The rubbings of inscriptions on metal that have been added to the collection are still being organized and will soon be printed. (3) "Southwest Literature Series." The library has recently compiled the Southwest Literature Series, each published separately. The works included are either compiled by the library's staff or written by people outside the library. The first type is Chen Yuan's "A Study of Buddhism in Yunnan and Guizhou in the Late Ming Dynasty," consisting of six volumes and eighteen articles, with one attached article, totaling 120,000 words. It focuses on the prosperity of Buddhism in Yunnan and Guizhou in the late Ming Dynasty, attributing the reasons for its prosperity to three factors: (1) the wave of Buddhist revival, (2) the ability of monks to pioneer, and (3) the influence of the loss of the Central Plains. The first type is Ling Tiean's "Chronological Biography of Zheng Ziyin." Zheng was a master of practical learning in the Qing Dynasty, deeply versed in the Classics, especially the Book of Rites. He studied etymology and made many inventions. He was a great Confucian scholar in the Southwest. The chronological biography compiled by Ling consists of eight volumes totaling 120,000 words. It uses Ziyin's works as the basic material and includes all other writings that mention his deeds. It also establishes two sections, "Before the Biography" and "After the Biography." "Before the Biography" briefly describes the most relevant experiences of Ziyin's predecessors and friends. "After the Biography" describes the related events after Ziyin's death and the process of printing his posthumous works. It also includes relevant portraits of people and Ziyin's handwriting to inspire emotions. The third type is Fang Shumei's "Collection of Tomb Biographies of Yunnan," imitating the works of Qian Yiji, Miao Quansun, and Min Erchang, searching for all the inscriptions and biographies of Yunnan figures. The entire book consists of 500,000 words, with an index of names attached at the end, making it an important reference book. All of them have been entrusted to the Commercial Press for typesetting and distribution. (4) "Second Collection of Rare Books." The first collection of rare books was commissioned by the Commercial Press in 1936. Now, twelve rare and unpublished books on the history and geography of the Southwest have been selected and compiled into the second collection. The catalogue is as follows: (1) "Yunnan Illustrated Classics Records," ten volumes, compiled by Chen Wen of the Ming Dynasty, Jingtai woodblock edition.

(8) "Guilin County Records," twenty volumes, compiled by Chen Lian of the Ming Dynasty, Xuande edition. (9) "Gui Sheng," sixteen volumes, written by Zhang Mingfeng of the Ming Dynasty, old manuscript. (10) "Records of Customs of Baiyue," unclassified, annotated by Zheng of Houguan, Han Ju manuscript.

<h3 id="e73">The United Cup Basketball Game Yesterday: Paramount Won a Narrow Victory, 54-48, Winning Qunyi by Two Points, Shanghai Qing Beat Qifan Again, 44-30 <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The United Cup Charity Basketball Game was a Class A Group 1 game yesterday. The atmosphere on the court was quite lively. In the first act, Paramount played against Qunyi. Since defeating Shanghai Qing, Qunyi's reputation has doubled. The tense emotions of yesterday's battle against Paramount were expected. Bao Songyuan, the tall player of Paramount, is currently returning to his hometown to visit relatives, so the battle against Qunyi was particularly close. In yesterday's game, Tao Shaosheng of Junyi was still the main scorer, scoring as many as seven goals in the first half. On the Paramount side, Jia Youliang, who had just returned from a long trip, assisted, and the progress was very even. In the first half, Qunyi had a one-point advantage with 23-22. After changing sides, Tao Shaosheng of Qunyi was closely guarded by Paramount, so he only scored one shot and one free throw. Weng Renan's score was still rising sharply, keeping pace with Paramount. However, there were many fouls, so in addition to the increasingly average shooting, Paramount also got many free throws. Therefore, the score rose and fell, and the difference was unusually close. After Tao Shaosheng and Feng Nianhua were successively fouled out of the game, the two sides became more and more closely contested. When time ran out, Paramount scored three more points, making up for its shortcomings, and taking the lead with 50-48. In the game between Shanghai Qing and Qifan, Qifan was a bit short and ultimately felt slightly inferior. As a result, Shanghai Qing took a 19-13 lead in the first half, and then won again with 25-17 in the second half. The overall result was 44-30, and Shanghai Qing defeated Qifan again.</p>

<p>The Wenbin Cup Charity Small Ball game, at the last moment yesterday, unexpectedly Lianyi and Samsung, two heroes, played out a difficult and inseparable tie. The half-hour extension match was due to heavy rain, so both sides agreed to hold a decisive battle next Saturday. Before yesterday's game, Wenbin won against Zhenhua in the exhibition match with a score of 3-0. As soon as the main battle between Lianyi and Samsung started, Li Yichen made a long shot from 30 yards, but it was caught by Dong Jincai. Dong was in his best condition yesterday, so many of Li Yichen's ingenious shots were saved by him one by one. The first half ended in a scoreless draw. After changing sides, the rain suddenly fell, and both sides hunted in the rain, their spirits were doubled. After ten minutes, Wu Qixiang, a new general of Lianyi, was making a fierce attack, but was unexpectedly saved by Dong Jincai, who passed it far to Zhu Weizhong. Meng Yiliang intercepted, was passed by Zhu, Gu Biao received it and leaked it out, and Xiao Ziwen rushed up and kicked it in, opening the record. Samsung won the first goal. At that time, the rain became more and more intense. Until the last five minutes, Zhang Mingsheng and Wu Qixiang joined forces to attack, and Feng Shoupeng rescued, accidentally committing a foul and being penalized with a free ball. Wu Qixiang enforced it and waved his foot at 28 yards, penetrating the net, and finally forming a tie of one goal each. A decisive battle will be held next Saturday.</p>

<p>In the World Policies of the United States and the Soviet Union, Which is More Important, the Far East or Europe?</p>
<p>What Kind of Impact Will the Economic World Have in the Different Emphasis? (Continued)</p>
<p>The relative importance of the Far East and Europe in the world policies of the United States and the Soviet Union can be answered differently from political and economic perspectives. Since the Soviet Union concluded the Nomonhan Agreement with Japan, it has adopted a defensive stance in the Far East and an offensive stance in Europe. Therefore, in its world policy, Europe is more important than the Far East. The same is true from an economic point of view. Since compromising with Germany, with the expansion of territory, the volume of trade with European countries has also increased dramatically. The United States is different. From a political point of view, the positions of the Far East and Europe in its world policy are equal. The important diplomatic principle of the United States is the Monroe Doctrine. As long as other countries do not interfere in the affairs of the Americas, then the United States may not come out to interfere in the affairs of the world. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese and European wars, although it has provided moral rescue or material assistance to the invaded countries, it has always felt that the sanctions against the aggressor countries are not thorough. From an economic point of view, the Far East is actually more important than Europe in the United States' policy, because the economic interests of the United States are in the Pacific. If its economic interests are damaged, the United States will never give up. Therefore, American commentators often say that the possibility of the United States participating in the war in the Far East is greater than in Europe, which is this opinion. The United States' two loans to China to purchase goods are also necessary retaliatory actions taken after economic interests are threatened. In addition, the opinions of Mr. Zhang Xiande, Luo Pan, Wang Pingou, Ye Ziqing, Shi Yun, Zhang Junping, Jin Yiqun, etc. are roughly similar.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The United States Emphasizes Europe While the Soviet Union Emphasizes Asia <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Qi Wei took a look at the position of the Far East in the world policy of the United States, which seems to be more inclined to Europe. As the navy is stationed in the Pacific, strengthening the defense forces of the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii is proof of this. However, the capital of the Soviet Union is in Europe, so its world policy naturally considers Europe to be the most important. The development of the Baltic Sea and Balkan Peninsula countries in recent years is also proof of this.</p>
<p>However, the so-called importance of the position is relative, due to the changes in the international situation and the different interests of the country. Everything has the possibility of changing course.</p>
<p>As for the impact of the economic world, as far as the United States is concerned: it has always been at odds with Japan, and it is deeply incompatible. Therefore, it not only sympathizes with our country's resistance war, but also actively provides economic assistance. For example, the continuous flow of military fire and machinery to China, and the influx of specialized talents to help our country develop the economy in the southwest, so as to benefit the long-term resistance war, is an unknown fact. Now that the southwest transportation has been cut off and transportation is difficult, and the United Kingdom has been attacked by Germany and the situation is critical, it has to do its best to help the United Kingdom. Therefore, for the Far East incident, it can only announce the embargo of oil and scrap iron, and passively cut off the supply of raw materials for Japan's war.</p>
<p>As far as the Soviet Union is concerned: it has recently been satisfied with its development in Europe; coupled with Germany's blitzkrieg tactics, which swallowed the whole of Europe, it has some worries and naturally does not want to give more economic assistance to cause trouble for itself. Therefore, it will take a bystander attitude towards the Anglo-German contest. As for the Far East, Japan is a world enemy, and it has recently witnessed its forcing Annam and Burma to cut off traffic with China. China is inevitably affected spiritually and materially. According to the meaning of lips and teeth helping each other, it has to actively help. Moreover, the northwest traffic is as complete as before; in the future, the quantity of military fire, machinery, and talents from the Soviet Union to China should be considerable. Up to now, 147 answers have been received regarding these two questions. This time, no special experts were invited to answer, so that the opinions of all circles could be fully expressed. However, due to limited space, there are many who have been cut off; and the method of nominating and expressing everyone's opinions continues. The unanswered parts of the first question and the answers to the second and third questions are published as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Regarding Essay Submissions <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The essay questions for this week are: (4) Does the fate of the British pound depend on whether Britain can sustain a protracted war? Can Britain sustain a protracted war? What impact will changes in the fate of the British pound have on international finance? (5) Can the victory or defeat of the Allied forces affect the world's post-war monetary system? Will there be changes in the role of gold in currency after the war?</p>
<p>The answers to these two questions can be slightly longer, and it is acceptable to answer them together rather than separately. However, it is hoped that they will include the above two points and be submitted by Saturday of this week. Although their level is what? It still needs to be judged by their attitude towards the Balkan Peninsula, and its proportion of aid to China is arguably the most important today. Therefore, in the short term – during the war – the economic relations between our country and the Soviet Union, and between the United States and Britain, will become closer, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Zhang Qiguang, Mr. Dai Detian, Mr. Dong Pingru, Mr. Huang Ziping, Mr. Ma Haoru, Mr. Yu Xiaoshan, Mr. Xing Yu, Mr. He Ke, and others have similar opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Asia is Slightly More Important than Europe <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xingchu: I believe that the world policies of the United States and the Soviet Union have always placed equal emphasis on the Far East and Europe. The United States' implementation of the oil and iron embargo is not only aimed at Germany and Italy in Europe, but also at Japan in the Far East. Similarly, although the Soviet Union has recently been scheming in Northern Europe and the Balkans, and is striving to strengthen its defenses on the Northwest border, we must understand that this proactive measure, this spirit of being prepared for any eventuality, is precisely what it is doing to prepare for any emergencies that may arise in Siberia in the future.</p>
<p>If it is necessary to distinguish between the advantages and disadvantages of Europe and the Far East, then in the minds of the United States and the Soviet Union, the proportion occupied by the two is more on the Pacific Ocean than on the Atlantic Ocean. If the United States and the Soviet Union can take joint action based on their own interests and humanity's sense of justice, it is not difficult to imagine how great a force this will form; this great force can not only stabilize East Asia once and for all, but also inevitably further stabilize the economic order of mankind.</p>
<p>Hu Jingqing: In the European group of wars, both sides of the belligerent countries are equally colonial plundering wars. The outcome of victory or defeat mainly lies in the re-division of colonies. The war in the Far East is a war of self-defense against aggression. Its victory can make the world abide by laws and treaties and maintain peace and order! The other side attempts to monopolize China, expel any country that has a relationship with China, and even destroy the world's public justice, legal order, and the United States and the Soviet Union are pillars of stabilizing the situation in the current world situation. Because it is necessary to stabilize the world situation, the Far East naturally occupies a more important position than Europe in their world policies. As for the impact on the economic world; in a stable situation, whether it is China's or the world's, it is bound to tend towards prosperity, because China is in the process of construction, it has endless hidden treasures, and the economic world needs to ask and develop it. Otherwise; if world stability cannot be established, the economic world will only suffocate and die!</p>
<p>Jiang Zhicheng: In the situation where the European situation (Britain and Germany) is in a stalemate and it is impossible to reach a compromise, the United States' world policy focuses on controlling the Far East; the United States is currently working hard to expand its military strength, and its significance is: (A) to help Britain with a retreat in place, so that it can carry out a sustained war against Germany, creating a stalemate. (B) To defend Germany and Italy from developing towards the Americas; (C) The main thing is to prepare to seize colonies from Australia, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and even Africa and small countries, (D) To serve as a pillar for the anti-aggression and oppressed national liberation movements.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's world policy is to eliminate the possibility of an international anti-Soviet war as much as possible, strengthen the contradictions between imperialist countries, and strengthen the power of the world revolution (the proletarian social revolution and the liberation movement of oppressed nations). Therefore, in the same situation (stalemate between Britain and Germany), the Soviet Union must now focus on fully assisting the liberation movement of oppressed nations, in order to prepare the conditions for determining the victory or defeat of the world revolution; the Far East is precisely the mainstream of the national movement.</p>
<p>The entire world economy will be severely damaged and affected by the war; the United States and the Soviet Union have strengthened their control over the world economy, especially over Finland, Sweden! ·South·Turkey and the semi-independent countries in the Near East and Far East, the national economies of these countries will generally develop independently and upward, and the Chinese national economy will have a bright future for free development under the policy of adhering to the war of resistance!</p>

<p>Chen Longzhang: The world policies of the United States and the Soviet Union: It is clear that Europe is more important than the Far East at present. The United States uses raising the price of gold pounds to balance the exchange rate between the United States and Britain as economic aid. The ultimate goal is to save the collapse of the British Empire, so as not to affect the future of the entire financial capitalism. In order to prevent the spread of imperialist wars to the Balkans and Northern Europe, the Soviet Union is striving to strengthen and expand the strength of the Red Army and the strongholds of socialist countries; the ultimate result will be that Germany will not be able to find material supplies from the Balkan and Northern European countries (including oil and food). And it will make Britain lose the sympathy and assistance of the neutral small countries. The difficulty of combat on both sides has increased, and the war will end early.</p>
<p>As for the Far East, because the United States has fewer interests, it adopts a policy of not directly conflicting with Japan. However, China will receive greater assistance from the Soviet Union (including arms and aircraft), and will feel the greatness, reliability, and permanence of the assistance from socialist countries over time. In the world policies of the United States and the Soviet Union, China will inevitably move towards a self-sufficient economic path.</p>

<p>Under what circumstances will the Far East and the European situation be more likely to be linked? Or is it more likely to be individual?</p>
<h3 id="e81">First Set of Answers <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiao: This question should be answered from the essence of the Far East and European war situations and the international environment surrounding them. First, from China's perspective, the Far East war situation is for the liberation of the nation. From Japan's perspective, it is to expand its colonies. The European war situation, whether it is Germany, Italy, or Britain, is for the sake of vying for colonies. A clue can already be found here, that is, apart from the fact that China's purpose in waging war is different from other countries, Japan's purpose in waging war is basically the same as that of Britain, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, both Britain, Germany, and Italy are trying their best to win over Japan to contain the other side. But assuming that one side wins over Japan, but China ignores it, China will never contact Britain and Japan to fight Germany and Italy, nor will it contact Germany and Italy to fight Britain and the United States. Therefore, this connection is one-sided. And at the moment, it does have a great possibility.</p>
<p>Second, assuming that the anti-Soviet war in Europe is formed (this possibility is gradually decreasing), or that the United States participates in the European war and fights simultaneously in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (judging from Roosevelt's military expansion budget, he has this determination), then China can only bury its head and intensify its own war of resistance.</p>
<p>The conclusion is this: the connection between the Far East and the European situation will be one-sided.</p>
<p>Bi Guocai: The war in the Far East is a struggle for the survival of countries and nations by the invaded; the war in the West is a struggle for world hegemony and colonies among the great powers. Since the goals of the two are different, it is difficult to establish a connection. Even if the international situation changes, the United States helps Britain fight against Germany and Italy, and Japan takes the opportunity to advance south, thereby triggering a conflict between the United States and Japan, it is not allowed to be regarded as a connection, because China has never been an enemy of Germany and Italy; even if Germany and Italy have not allied with Japan, they will never help Japan attack us, because it seems more advantageous for them to have fewer enemies. Moreover, Germany, Italy, and Japan are superficially in harmony, and there is absolutely no possibility of coordination in their interests. So, is there no possibility of a connection between the Far East and the European situation after all? It seems not, when two tigers fight, there must be casualties. At that time, the oppressed in the world will take the opportunity to rise up and seek national independence and national liberation, and the connection between the Far East and the European situation will also be at that time! However, it is still difficult to say at this time which of the two is more likely, and it must wait for the proof of facts.</p>
<p>As for the economic world, under the state of connection, countries will inevitably embark on the road of strong national capital to exclude cloth team capital. In the individual state, the world economy will form two major groups, one centered on Britain and the United States, and the other dominated by Germany and Italy. They stand in opposition to each other and compete for supremacy. In this different situation, the Chinese economic world can only set its sights, seize the opportunity, and use means that are conducive to the war of resistance to adapt to the environment, so that China can complete the mission of the war of resistance as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Du Yun: The Far East and the West play a connecting role under the same circumstances of maintaining the inherent territories of the world's countries, so-called anti-aggression. However, because China is the supporter in the Far East, and Britain is the supporter in the West, it seems that there is not much animosity towards other countries besides the only enemy in each country, so it plays an individual role. Judging from the current situation, individual possibilities will still be greater in the future. It may not start to shift to the connection side until one side – the supporter of the Far East or the West – has won a victory.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Second Set of Answers <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Zhicheng: In terms of the meaning of world politics and world economy, the Far East and Europe are originally a connected body. From a purely military point of view, although it can be divided into the Far East battlefield and the European battlefield, "war is bloody politics" is nothing more than to achieve the purpose of economic plunder and political rule. From this point of view, the current problem lies with the United States: (A) The United States' intervention in the European war (serious aid to Britain) has led to the strengthening and coordination of the Germany-Italy-Japan axis, making the two war situations mixed into one. (B) The United States strengthens its Far East policy and does not interfere in the European war (to a certain extent), which may make the war develop individually. Europe is opposed by Britain, Germany, and Italy, and the Far East is opposed by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Japan. In a short period of time, there is a possibility of individual development of the war. However, war has its own logic, and it will follow its own logic. Imperialists can launch wars, but they cannot control wars. Wars will eventually develop into their own world as a whole to complete their historical mission.</p>
<p>Qi Jing: The Far East and the European situation will play a connecting role under any of the following situations. That is,</p>
<p>(1) Britain declares war on Germany and Italy in Europe; and declares war on Japan in the Far East due to the oppression of Japan. (Although China has no reason to declare war on Germany and Italy, it is standing on the same front line with Britain in fact, and objectively speaking, it is in a hostile position with Germany and Italy.)</p>
<p>(2) The United States is greatly threatened due to the rapid advance of Japan's southward policy, and has to help Britain declare war on the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>(3) The Soviet Russia and Britain abandon their prejudices and follow the United States in declaring war on the omnipotent country.</p>
<p>The above effects are still difficult to see at present. On the contrary, although China and Japan continue to wage war in the Far East, the war between Britain and Germany and Italy in Europe is also continuing, but the scope is not large and does not play a connecting role. This is an individual war.</p>
<p>According to the current situation,</p>
<p>(1) Britain alone will never have the courage to fight Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan in the Far East at the same time without the support of other strong countries.</p>
<p>(2) The United States only seeks to mass-produce and sell military supplies, which can not only obtain huge profits, but also gain the good reputation of supporting justice. It seems that there is no intention to participate in the war for a while.</p>
<p>(3) The Soviet Union itself is a communist country, and it is difficult to get along with any democratic or omnipotent country. The best thing is that all the great powers are dragged into the vortex, and it can stay out of the matter and sit back and watch them die. There is no possibility of helping Britain participate in the war.</p>
<p>Based on the above: it can be seen that the possibility of a connection between the Far East and the European war is very small. However, if the war between Britain and Germany and Italy in Europe is difficult to resolve quickly and becomes a protracted stalemate, and the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East cannot be resolved for a while, then the United States may participate in the war for its own interests, so that a connection will occur between the two sides.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Third Set of Answers <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhantao: Japan's southward policy is nothing more than to use this to intimidate the British and American countries, forcing them to withdraw from the Far East and seek exclusive profits. According to the current situation, Japan's southward policy is very likely to promote the strengthening of cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, and even lead to war. If so, Japan will beg Germany and Italy for cooperation. China is fighting for independence and survival, and it is not originally intended to connect Europe and Asia. In order to prevent Japan from invading Sichuan and Yunnan through the southward policy, it is inevitable that China will cooperate with Britain and the United States to resist Japan. As a result, the Far East and the European situation will play a connecting role. If Britain and the United States are concerned about the European situation and show weakness to Japan, and withdraw from the Far East or bow their heads and obey, then Japan will definitely work hard to step up its invasion of China. Although the Soviet Union has a pivotal position between Europe and Asia, because the Soviet Union is currently at a time when its western land defenses are not consolidated and it is focusing on consolidating its national strength, it seems unwilling to offend any great power. Moreover, Japan would never dare to stimulate the Soviet Union recently. Therefore, the Far East and the European situation still occupy their respective positions and are not commensurate with each other.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, it is predicted that the individual role will be greater in the future.</p>
<p>Gongsun Chengyuan: If the relationship between Japan and Germany can be strengthened to a military alliance, the Far East and the European situation will be connected. However, the Soviet Union and the United States may form an opposing group in the East, even though the Soviet Union is allied with Germany in the West. Japan knows this reaction, so Konoe's foreign policy wants to strengthen the Germany-Italy-Japan axis on the one hand, and adjust relations with the Soviet Union and the United States on the other hand. As a result of this evolution of foreign policy, the establishment of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is impossible. Based on this situation, it is predicted that the European situation and the Far East will not be connected in the near future. But if the war in Western Europe determines the outcome, the European situation and the Far East will undoubtedly be connected. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Sheng Kai</p>
<p>Promotion of Agricultural Finance</p>
<p>The Chinese government has recently implemented two new policies in agricultural finance. One is that the National Grain Administration officially started working on August 1st. It is divided into an administrative control department, which handles matters such as the investigation and statistics of grain; a business control department, which handles matters such as the production and sales of grain; and a transportation and sales department and a secretariat. The initial work of the bureau is to clarify the national grain situation - especially the past situation of grain and grain merchants; and then carry out grain regulation work, on the one hand, paying attention to the planned regulation of military and civilian food, and on the other hand, paying attention to rational distribution. The second is the organization of the Provincial and County Agricultural Finance Promotion Committee. According to the United Office of the Central, Communications, Agriculture, and Fourth Banks, in order to develop the agricultural economy, an agricultural finance department will be set up under the Fourth United Office, and then an Agricultural Finance Design Committee will be organized to assist the central government in promoting agricultural finance policies. Now, in order to ensure that local agricultural finance can be effectively implemented in accordance with the central government's established policies and with the cooperation of all parties, a "Regulations for the Organization of Provincial and County Agricultural Finance Promotion Committees" has been formulated, and divided into four banks, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and the provincial branches of the Fourth United Office to jointly plan the establishment of Provincial and County Agricultural Finance Promotion Committees.</p>
<p>Since China has been engaged in a long-term war of resistance, the prosperous coastal cities have been completely destroyed, and economic construction in the rear is in the process of being carried out. In order to maintain the supplies for soldiers at the front, the food and clothing for the people in the rear, and increase export trade, supply industrial raw materials, and colonize refugee reclamation, all of them must rely on the promotion of agricultural finance. However, in order for agricultural finance to promote the development of the agricultural economy and increase production, the government must actively implement wartime agricultural finance policies, especially paying attention to cooperating with all parties to effectively promote agricultural finance policies. The Outline of Measures for Improving Local Financial Institutions promulgated on April 29, 1938, and the six proposals in the Chongqing Financial Conference on March 6, 1939, are the most important policies in China's wartime agricultural finance policy. In the middle of this year, the outline of the loan methods of the Central, Communications, and Agriculture Banks and the Central Trust and Agricultural Commercial Banks has made great progress in this regard. However, the loan driving area of the outline of the loan methods gives priority to Sichuan and Xikang provinces, and has not been popularized temporarily; the proposals in the Chongqing Financial Conference on purchasing materials, balancing prices, and providing grain have not been effectively implemented. And during this period of resistance and national construction: based on military reasons, the front line needs a lot of supplies, and it must be able to fully maintain the supply, especially how to plan the local regulation of civilian and military food; based on trade reasons, the industry in the occupied areas has mostly stagnated since the war of resistance, and the industry in free China is under construction. Now, the only thing that can be exported is agricultural products; based on financial reasons, the growth of China's wartime financial resources lies in collecting foreign exchange from the export control of fourteen categories of agricultural products; based on the reasons for resisting construction, the two credit loans to the United States and the barter trade to the Soviet Union are all based on tung oil, tea, pig bristles, and other agricultural products as ancestral guarantees or exchanges. Therefore, it is necessary to make full use of agricultural finance to promote the increase in agricultural production, and how to make the government's agricultural finance policies operate effectively, it is necessary to work hard to promote the work.</p>
<p>Promoting agricultural finance to develop the agricultural economy, so as to supply soldiers' supplies, maintain people's food and clothing, increase export trade, and supply industrial raw materials, is the driving force behind China's victory in the war of resistance. Therefore, the start of work of the National Grain Administration and the organization of the Provincial and County Agricultural Finance Promotion Committee give the Chinese people great expectations!

<p>According to the observation of people in the sugar market yesterday, the foreign exchange is still preventing further contraction today, so there are more buyers than sellers, and the price continues to rise. The current price of spot goods in the association is 24 yuan for coarse white sugar, and the initial price of foreign warehouse goods is 72 yuan to 72.35 yuan, and then it rises to 73 yuan, a good increase of 1 yuan before and after.

<p>The first batch of 21 new lily pads arrived and were sold out immediately, at 50 yuan. According to the production news, there was severe drought in the summer, the river channels were dry, and transportation was difficult, so the external costs increased. Moreover, some of them have been used as food, and the number of shipments has been greatly reduced. It is said that the next batch of goods will take time to arrive. According to the observation of the general public, the second plate will see an increase of 60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sichuan Fungus Rises Sharply <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The price of black fungus from Sichuan and Han is difficult to set recently, and it is inconvenient to transport. There is no further arrival. Only from Shangqiu, more than 100 packages were transported by train. The higher price is 370 yuan, and the lower price is slightly reduced. The price of Sichuan fungus has risen sharply to 420 yuan, an increase of nearly 40 yuan. It can be seen that it is in short supply. The post office sells it for 3670 yuan, and it is still expected to be firm.</p>

<p>The Northern Chan Temple inside the Qi Gate of Suzhou Prefecture has been in disrepair for a long time and has long been a place for groups of beggars to stay. Only the first level of the pagoda is left in the temple, which is impossibly high. There are vaguely branches and knots on the top of the pagoda, and it is impossible to tell whether it is grass or wood. On the 10th, a beggar with sores all over his body was dying. His companions were afraid of being infected and carried him to the bottom of the pagoda, where he lay down and groaned. Suddenly, a sugar apple fell from the pagoda, as big as a cup and bowl, fragrant, sweet, and lovely. The beggar was hungry and thirsty, so he took it and ate it. In a few days, the scabs disappeared and his illness was suddenly cured! The beggar told everyone he met. Well-wishers took a telescope and looked up carefully. They saw many ripe fruits on the tree, numbering in the hundreds, but since there was no way to climb up, they could only feast their eyes, not their mouths. Later, a monkey handler was found to urge the monkey to climb up and pick the fruits, but the monkey also shrank back halfway and could not climb to the top.</p>

<p>The ban on butchering in Suzhou is strict, but those who privately slaughter pigs tighten a bamboo hoop around the pig's mouth before wielding the knife, fearing the sound will be heard outside. A few days ago, a butcher closed his door and slaughtered three pigs. His family brought boiling water, but only heard the pigs screaming loudly. They knocked on the door, but there was no response. They pushed the door open and saw the bamboo hoop had come off the pig's mouth. The butcher had collapsed to the ground, unconscious. After being revived, he remained dazed. The doctor said he had suffered a burst gall from the shock and would not recover. Indeed, he died two days later.</p>

<h3 id="e90">A Humble Suggestion for Reforming Women's Clothing <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Xiawen</p>
<p>How strange! Women's clothing. In ancient times, long sleeves were good for dancing, and glances could convey charm. Now, sleeves barely reach the elbow. Eight-panel skirts dragged on the ground, gathering dust. Now, pants barely cover the knees. Breast wraps and waist cinchers concealed the chest. Now, emphasizing hygiene, breasts stand high. Wearing wooden clogs and white silk jackets is still considered important. Some say: Times have changed, clothing has changed. You are stuck in the ways of the ancients and do not follow today's customs, aren't you being pedantic? I say, not so. Clothing is a means to uphold rituals and distinguish social classes. A silk robe worn after bathing for coolness is not suitable for formal occasions. Can six inches of round, smooth skin and bare feet of a country girl be compared to ladies in their chambers? Prostitutes in brothels take the lead, and ladies from prominent families follow suit. Adornment leads to licentiousness, destroying rituals and neglecting education. Purple steals from red, and Zheng music disrupts classical music. The rightness or wrongness of character, the highness or lowness of social standing, are confused, making it impossible to discern. When a nation is about to fall, there will surely be monsters. Inappropriate clothing is a disaster for the body. People with conscience weep bitterly over this. Marriage is the beginning of human relations, and the education of example extends to brothers. The influence of the Guan Ju poem reaches the nobles. To correct others, one must first correct oneself. To govern a country, one must first manage the family. Hair reaching a foot high, a slim waist achieved by reducing food intake. The trends of customs and the resulting abuses are endless. Shouldn't we loudly call for improvement?</p>
<p>Now, men and women are equal, and women's rights are advocated. They demand political participation, study science, and serve society and the country. Who doesn't aspire to be like Liang Hongyu or Shen Yunying? Yet, in terms of clothing, they still follow prostitutes? The method of reform is not difficult. Enlightened and progressive women should first gather to discuss clothing styles and sizes. When young girls in their chambers are making new clothes, parents should provide examples. Schools should issue clear announcements to students, and principals and teachers should take the lead. Today's blue dress and long shirt are fashionable, appropriately highlighting height and envied for their beauty. Silk and satin are chosen according to one's wealth. Only the sleeves must reach the elbow, and the pants must cover the knees. With a simple change, customs will be greatly transformed. However, exposing the chest and raising the breasts is indeed physiologically necessary, and crucial for the future of procreation. The method of improvement is to gradually make the waist and torso wider, so that the body does not reveal a bumpy shape, and curves are not considered beautiful. Clothes should fit properly. Patriotic women, what should you do? I hope someone will teach me.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Sunglasses <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Bai</p>
<p>I happened to see an advertisement for an eyeglasses company in the newspaper that said, "When buying sunglasses, beware of foreign bottle bottoms." It certainly had a touch of humor, but in fact, there are many low-quality sunglasses on the market, so you must be careful when buying them.</p>
<p>As the weather gets hot, sunglasses become fashionable. On the streets, modern girls and suited gentlemen all wear black glasses, making it impossible to recognize even acquaintances at first glance. However, people only know that wearing black glasses is fashionable in the summer, but they don't know that low-quality sunglasses have their own specific harms.</p>
<p>This is basic common sense. Not only sunglasses, but even regular eyeglasses are best avoided if possible. Once you start wearing them, you can't take them off, and they become increasingly necessary, further impairing your eyesight. In the United States, there is a law regarding the sale of sunglasses that prohibits the sale of any sunglasses with glass or other crystalline materials that are not properly colored or dense, have unclear transparency standards, or are easily deformed.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, and even in all of China, such regulations are completely absent. People who wear sunglasses may not even notice that the quality of the sunglasses can affect their eyesight. Many people want to wear sunglasses and deliberately choose to buy cheap ones. You should know that wearing these low-priced, low-quality glasses for a summer can significantly damage your eyesight.</p>
<p>When a customer walks into an eyeglasses store wanting to buy a pair of sunglasses, they only care about whether the sunglasses are cheap and whether they can see things when they put them on. As for the structure of the eyes, the muscles, the movement of the crystalline lens, how eyesight passes through the glass or even the crystalline lens, and how it can deform objects, they know nothing. Especially whether it can damage their eyesight, they don't even pay attention to it.</p>
<p>According to surveys, millions of sunglasses are sold worldwide every year. Most of these are low-quality sunglasses that damage the eyesight of those who wear them. This clearly tells us that we should pay attention when buying sunglasses!</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>When Yu Qiushi of Wulin was the headmaster of Zhengyi Academy in Suzhou, he loved to eat water shield from Pangshan Lake. He asked Xu Zhenzhi for it, but by summer, the water shield was all gone. Yu continued to ask, so Xu hired someone to paint a special album to give as a reply. Yu personally inscribed the four characters "Autumn Wind, Hometown Flavor" and attached a poem: "Rains rise at dawn, chasing waves, bamboo baskets lightly carry green clouds. Tender threads warm with dragon saliva, fragrant leaves green, dividing emerald duckweed. I want to write a biography of a noble hermit, ashamed to accompany the beauty's cup. Who can awaken my dusty dream? I want to call you back with your help."</p>
<p>Ouyang Yongshu loved crucian carp. Mei Shengyu's family chef was skilled at cooking crucian carp mince, which he often sent as a gift. Therefore, the poetry collection of Mei Wanling has a poem titled "Six or Seven Crucian Carp Heads Waiting for Yongshu to Pass By," and another "Feeding Yongshu with Crucian Carp Mince."</p>
<p>Cheng Daonan of Xinhui loved betel nuts. When he was an official in the Ministry of Revenue, he met Wang Yuyang at the morning court one day. Yuyang jokingly gave him a poem: "Hurrying to court, fearing to miss the morning light, the officials listening to the drums are all busy. Arriving at the front gate, the gate is not yet open, sitting upright in the sedan, eating betel nuts."</p>
<p>There is a Fujian cake in Pingwang, commonly known as mint cake. Zhang Baosheng of Jiahe gifted it to Ding Longhong. Longhong ate it and found it delicious, so he gifted it to his mother and wrote a song to thank him, with the line "Old people eat it and live long and healthy," which the Min family published as an advertisement.</p>
<p>Tan Tuling loved shark fin. Every time he ate it, he ate heartily and said, "Didn't Mencius say: 'Fish is what I desire, and bear's paw is also what I desire?' Fish is a common item, not to be mentioned in the same breath as the precious bear's paw. It should be changed to 'Shark fin is what I desire,' then it would be almost correct." Those who heard this smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Master Manshu loved Molton candy and also liked domestic zongzi candy very much. In a letter to a friend overseas, he mentioned riding a donkey past Suzhou to eat Zizhi Zhai zongzi candy, but the character "Zi" in Zizhi Zhai was actually a mistake for "Cai."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Talking About Sleep <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>After working hard for a whole day, a person feels exhausted in the evening and needs rest. Sleep is the best way to rest. People of all times and places regard the evening as the only time for sleep. However, some people are very active in the evening and sleep silently during the day, so they rarely get to see the sunlight. It is certain that these people's bodies are not in good condition. Some people think that rest can hinder work, but they don't know that work needs rest to promote it. Because a person is a wonderful machine, even inanimate machines need rest, so can people not rest? Otherwise, the machine will be in danger of exploding. Overworking and laboring can of course cause illness, so sleep is absolutely necessary for us.</p>
<p>The common belief is that children need at least sixteen hours of sleep every day, and adults should have eight hours. But it is enough for us intellectuals to get eight hours of sleep. However, you should go to bed at nine or ten o'clock in the evening. Going to bed too early or too late is not suitable. It is best to throw away all other thoughts as soon as you get into bed, close your eyes, and sleep peacefully, and sleep soundly so that all parts of the body completely stop moving. However, the heart and lungs will not stop. So the best rest is dreamless sleep. If you dream, the brain nerves don't get rest. And the brain works the hardest during the day. All movements and thoughts are directed and instructed by it. If it can't rest peacefully at night, then this kind of sleep still can't clear away fatigue and hasn't reached a sufficient level. In the daytime, the spirit will not be refreshed, and there will be no interest in doing things.</p>
<p>The posture of sleep should also be paid attention to. It is generally believed that you should sleep on your right side for the first half of the night, because the lower opening of the stomach (the place where it enters the intestines) leans to the right, so lying on your right side makes it easier for food to enter the duodenum and then the small intestine. You should lie on your left side for the second half of the night. But scientists believe that lying on your back is best, because we have a very thick and straight spine on our back, and lying on your back can maintain its straightness, and the organs in the body can also stop in the correct position. If you lie on your left side, and our heart is on the side, how can it withstand such pressure? But lying on your side also has its benefits, that is, the reproductive organs are not suppressed, which can prevent the effects of bedwetting, sexual impulses, and nocturnal emissions.</p>

<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Chicken eggs and duck eggs used to cost only nine or ten copper coins each, but now they have risen to ten to twelve cents. If you want to eat a bowl of scrambled eggs, using two is very difficult, at least three must be used, and auxiliary products are also needed. All of a sudden, it will cost more than forty cents, which is barely enough for two bowls. How can it be said to be an economic dish? However, buying fish, meat, shrimp, and crabs is now more expensive than eggs, so it's good to eat scrambled eggs to change the taste. There are many ways to scramble eggs. Shrimp scrambled eggs are the most valuable, but small shrimp are relatively cheap, so you might as well eat them. Pork scrambled eggs can also be eaten with rice. Recently, my family has been chopping onions and tomatoes into small pieces, then breaking and mixing chicken or duck eggs, and stir-frying them in an oil pan. If you like curry, add some curry powder. The aroma when frying is already appetizing, and it is even more delicious with rice. If you spread it on bread, it is also very delicious. However, the only requirement for scrambled eggs is that they must be stir-fried until tender, otherwise they will not be delicious.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Battle Scenery on the Western European Cape <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>This poem is a record of the Dutch battlefield before it was occupied by the German army. As for after the German army occupied it, other than the temporary transformation of Rotterdam into a fortified city, awaiting post-war repairs, everything else remained as before. (Note: Fortified City is the ancient saying "Strict City". The opposite is the modern diplomatic term "Open City." An open city is a city that does not station heavy troops and is gathered by a large group of civilians.)</p>
<p>Part 1: Clothing - A blue robe serves a thousand purposes, a blue tent and a lamp plan a small amount. A small shelter with mud seals the Qin years, all nations sharing the same fate, an ode to having no clothes.</p>
<p>Note: Western-style clothes are very time-consuming to put on in an emergency. Those who were caught napping and fled in a panic during the bombing of Rotterdam added a short jacket over their underclothes, becoming a laughingstock. This is far less convenient than Chinese clothes, which can be worn quickly. Also, under the blackout regulations, only dark blue paper can be used to completely cover the window to prevent the slightest light from leaking. A small shelter with mud seals refers to air-raid shelters on street corners. Pedestrians on the road must take shelter in them when an alarm is sounded. After the war, people who had no homes were provided with clothes and bedding by residents, which were carried out by boy scouts for loan.</p>
<p>Part 2: Food - The flame of the stove rises and falls, enduring boiling and tasting. Deep in the cave, the kitchen is busy. Steamed food is slow to ripen, difficult to warm a dream. The faint sound of a lone whistle suddenly passes over the wall.</p>
<p>Note: Staying at home all day and not going out, the most one thinks about is food and drink. However, on the day Rotterdam was bombed, an alarm was sounded every fifteen minutes, and the coal fire was frequently interrupted, so the food in the pot was often not fully cooked. The sirens of the Dutch system yelp and yelp, with continuous ups and downs. A long, drawn-out sound is an all-clear.</p>
<p>Part 3: Housing - The dawn light on the tall building is clear and refreshing. Migrating birds sing of peace. A thunderbolt from the sky, a Blitz day surprises a snap of the fingers. Breaking dreams with a hammer against the window, a resounding sound.</p>
<p>Note: At the beginning of Yin on May 10, 1940, migrating birds sang in harmony, what a clear and peaceful scene. Unexpectedly, parachuting generals descended from the sky, thunderous cannons and shelling followed, and the air pressure slammed horizontally, shattering the bright windows. If the glass window was not sealed with strips of paper three centimeters wide, forming a grid, the broken pieces would scatter like flour (threatening to burst out), precarious.</p>
<p>Part 4: Transportation - The long lanes and flower forests are piled with brocade. Beyond the blue sky and clouds, thunder moves the eyes. Empty, with no traces of people, the heavy gates are closed. Feathered birds fly high, urging the evening scenery.</p>
<p>Note: Once an alarm is sounded, no pedestrians are allowed on the road until the all-clear sounds. Residents hold their breath at home, mostly with heavy doors tightly closed. Living in a dangerous, war-torn city, only with the effort of stillness can one prevent all panic and annoyance. One is absolutely not allowed to go out before 8:00 AM and after 8:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e98">"Autumn Tiger" <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>After a heavy rain after the Beginning of Autumn, the weather suddenly cooled down, truly giving the appearance of "one rain making autumn." But before the flood had receded, the sun stuck its head out of the clouds again, and its hot and spicy aura was even hotter than the days in the Great Heat, and the treetops did not move, and there was no wind at all, and the dying autumn cicadas also took advantage of this last chance to shout loudly in this stuffy climate, which is called "Autumn Tiger."</p>
<p>Tigers are terrible beasts. In old novels, the description of a tiger's roar when it is about to appear makes one tremble without stuffing one's ears. So when adults coax children, they all say, "The tiger is coming!" Writing the character "King" on the forehead on the Dragon Boat Festival actually has the effect of warding off evil. Even a shrewish woman is called a "female tiger." In short, "tiger" is already a representative word for terrible. "Autumn Tiger" means the "tiger" days of "autumn."</p>
<p>But the animal trainers in the circus, not only tigers, but other lions and leopards, etc., are also made to obey obediently under the command of an electric whip, drilling fire circles, crossing rope bridges, and daring not to resist in the slightest. Even if they sometimes want to roar angrily, they only need to hear the sound of the whip hitting the ground, and they will bow their heads and submit. This is still a real tiger.</p>
<p>In the elementary school textbook, there is a lesson called "A Donkey Wearing a Tiger Skin." That donkey put on a tiger skin and thought it was a "tiger," but once it was exposed, wasn't it still a stubborn donkey? This is what the saying means, "pricking a paper tiger."</p>
<p>After the autumn equinox, the weather will naturally cool down. These two days of heat are just like the "cold bursts" that must occur a few days after the Beginning of Spring, and besides, by the evening, it is already the scene of autumn coolness like water.</p>

<p>The Sixty-Third Pharmacy in this city believes that the turtle shape drawn on the trademark of the kidney-tonifying pills produced by Meiling Pharmacy is suspected of imitating the trademark of Shenqi pills. They submitted a complaint to the court. The defendant argued that the size of the turtle shape was different. Yesterday, the court ruled that they were not guilty. The strange sign "Heaven Knows" has a good name that is spread among children. Today, there is another trademark lawsuit, arguing only about the differences in size.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Bad News</p>
<p>Standing in the elevator, I naturally wanted to make full use of my vision, but I didn't dare to use it too hastily. I pretended to be very natural, and swept my eyes around the elevator room, which was less than six feet square. There were a total of eight or nine people in the elevator, men, women, old, young, of course all. My gaze naturally lingered on the last but one man in a suit I was tracking. He was facing away from me, wearing a new and crisp bean-paste-colored black striped Spontak suit, and was an inch or two shorter than me. He wasn't wearing a hat, and his dark hair was gleaming under the electric lights from the pomade. I gradually moved forward a little, turned to face him, and a burst of fragrance wafted into my nose. My gaze fell on his face, and I couldn't help but be disappointed. He wasn't Zhao Bonan!</p>
<p>The elevator passed the second floor, the third floor, the doors closed, the doors opened, and routinely spat out and took in several passengers. But the person I was paying attention to didn't leave. He had a narrow face, and his fair skin was clearly half the credit of snow cream. A pair of lively eyes, paired with two thick eyebrows, and a high-bridged nose, did indeed have a kind of "terrible" masculine beauty! How could the adjective terrible be added to the word beauty? Because a man possessing this handsome appearance naturally has a kind of mysterious power to attract women. A young man possessing this mysterious power, if lacking thorough rationality and resolute determination, will often unknowingly ruin his career, his personality, and even his life! How could that not be terrible?</p>
<p>I didn't recognize this person - no, I suddenly remembered what the number seventy-one tea room attendant said. When he saw the photo of Yu Gantang that Huo Sang gave him, he said that when he saw that young man, he seemed to be angry, unlike the smiling face in the photo. Yes, the young man standing in front of me at this moment also had a sullen face, with absolutely no smile. It's not easy to identify a person's face based on a photo. If their emotions are very different, it's even more difficult. But there's also a trick to it, you have to grasp a feature of the face. Yu Gantang naturally also had his features, two thick eyebrows, a high nose, no matter if he was happy, angry, or sad, these features would never change.</p>
<p>Alas, this person is Yu Gantang!</p>
<p>The elevator had already risen to the sixth floor. He still didn't leave. But there were only five or six people left in the elevator. I estimated his age to be only around twenty. At his age, his face fully showed that he possessed abundant natural talent, but because of a fallen woman, he was suffering from suspicion of murder! I could only sigh silently. At this time, not only was his face sullen, but there was also a kind of panic and anxiety in his expression. His right hand was in his short jacket pocket, and his left hand was constantly stroking the red and blue striped tie. He turned his body towards the elevator door, he was preparing to go out. When the door opened on the seventh floor, he indeed walked out. Of course, I also followed him out without making a sound. (73)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Talking About Overcrowded Employment Agencies <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Apprentice</p>
<p>Today I saw an illustration in this magazine of an overcrowded employment agency. This is certainly a serious problem, but on the other hand, it is also the result of some "ayi" (maids) picking and choosing the best jobs. Here is an example.</p>
<p>I have a relative who has a large family and has always hired an old "ayi" from his hometown. Last month, the "ayi" had something to do and went back home, so he asked someone to find one at an employment agency. She worked for one day, and then she left, claiming to be unwell. Helplessly, he asked someone to find another one. But after a while, she said that people from her hometown were calling her back, and she left again. Several others left one after another. Finally, to this day, he still hasn't found one. Later, that relative was extremely strange, "Why are Shanghai 'ayi's like important people, not staying long in one place?" So he spent many days investigating before he finally understood.</p>
<p>Shanghai is indeed extraordinary, the so-called land of outstanding people and spirits. An "Ah Tu Sheng" (bumpkin) from the interior, after being baptized by Shanghai, completely changes in the blink of an eye. How can "ayi"s be an exception? It turns out that there are many "nouveau riche" in Shanghai now. They are good at having a lot of money, hiring more "ayi"s to show off, it doesn't matter to them. They have less work, more side income, and everything is better than ordinary families, so most "ayi"s are eagerly wanting to eat fatty meat. To put it bluntly, they are all wanting to get something for nothing. But getting into a rich family is definitely not something they can get easily, so they have to knock on doors one by one. This makes life hard for ordinary families, and at the same time, employment agencies are as crowded as marketplaces.</p>
