<p>社評</p>
<h3>中日戰況與遠東局勢</h3>
<p>歐戰的烽火向著巴爾幹半島蔓延，三國盟約第三條所規定各簽字國須於新的形勢下互相援助的條件，於此將首先遇到測騐；雖然日本已經有逃避履行義務的趨勢，但無論如何，歐戰的擴大與蘇聯西疆的不靖，都是今日日方所祈求之不得的事，因為那正是便於其在遠東從事新的投機冒險的有利時機。是以日來華軍在東南兩戰塲所克復名城的戰果，對於將會益趨動盪的遠東危局，正具有重大的意義。</p>
<p>日本的南進企圖，固然是用以濟侵華失敗之窮，同時亦適足使其對於侵華戰事的注意力與實力都更趨分散。日方某政論家前此曾對日人之見異思遷，於侵華尙無結果之際侈談南進，深致詬病；良以日本目前的資源實力，欲同時進行侵華與南進，到底為事實所不允許；而且假如南進倖而奏效，則勢將減低日人對於侵華的興趣，萬一遭受挫折，亦必增加對華戰意的頹唐。最近中日戰局中所表現的情況，適足證明後一假定的談言微中，因為日軍在中國戰塲上的遭遇，正繼其南進活動碰壁之後而潰敗踵接。</p>
<p>就半年以來戰事經過來觀察；自從春夏之交的鄂中戰役而後，比較沒有發生大規模的戰略會戰；日方侵川侵滇之說，都不過徒託空言；所謂秋季攻勢也僅以皖南浙西的所謂掃蕩戰略資點綴，而華軍的反攻則適於此際收穫重大效果；東戰塲克復了涇縣臨安諸曁以至浙東重鎭的紹興，南戰塲克復了日軍據守經年的內侵根據地南寗和龍州明江綏淥等地。此兩方面的戰役，在性質上固各不相侔，前者是「掃蕩」與「反掃蕩」的角逐，後者是關於戰略據點的爭奪，但却同樣屬於華軍戰略以至戰術的重大成就，證明了日軍不只於甫行竄據的城市無力防禦，大異於前此之攻地，即立行鞏固工事，從事死守，且連經營已久的重要根據地亦復不能確保，開三年來華軍克復重鎭的新紀元。兩軍強弱之比，攻守之勢，此後都應以新的尺度去估量，而中國反攻的奏效，尤其是桂南方面，即對於日方的南進企圖，也是一個重大的打擊。</p>
<p>日軍去冬之侵入桂南，原屬一石二鳥政策的表現，一方固要藉欽防邕寗據點以準備入犯西南腹地；另一方面，又恰好利用之作為南窺越南的張本。當時中國曾經一再促起關係國家注意，而法越當局却始終懵懂不察，因循坐誤，始終未在歐陸潰敗之前從事未雨綢繆以為之備；終致法越權益在不久以前遭受重大損害，此一危機今且仍在繼長增高中。日本進兵越北之後，邕龍據點固已減低了侵越的作用，但日方無論繼續南進或西侵，邕龍方面的桂南區域適為極有價值的後方，足與海防河內一綫互為犄角，在戰略和運輸上都有重大意義。是以如謂日軍因為越南談判解決，對邕龍即不妨放棄，顯然只是掩飾戰敗的託詞與前此湘北鄂北之役如出一轍。邕龍重入華方掌握之後，不只雲南可以免除兩面受敵的危險，華軍在桂南的地位更適足俯新的威脅。日本海軍雖至今仍形完整，且其三年來秘密造艦的成果與落水新艦的性能都非外人所能深悉；但由侵華日軍所表現軍力支絀累遭敗績的事實，確有理由可以相信：即使日海軍在配備方面如何精良，其實際作戰力量也未必竟能與其在華部隊大相逕庭，因為那同樣要受經濟資源，其所需人力物力的儲備和補充，都越過了屆近耗竭的日本實際能力。如果說於侵華軍迭遭敗衂之餘，僅恃其海軍實力即可利用歐戰擴大的時機完成南進迷夢，那到底是難於置信的事。</p>
<p>最近華軍反攻之獲勝，確實證明了中國的禦侮戰爭適與英美強硬政策同為安定遠東的基本要素，而且中國在軍事上愈成功，遠東危機更愈減低。最近日本在各方面都遇到挫折，此後無論其究將以新的軍事攻勢與政治攻勢相配合以謀『中國事變』的解決，抑或轉而利用國際新形勢作擴展的冒險，那雖可斷言其必難輕易獲逞，但却是中外各關係方面所應密切注意的事。</p>

<p>法總領事　表示合作</p>
<p>據消息可靠方面傅出、新任法總領事馬傑禮抵滬後、曾一度拜會高三分院院長楊鵬、此雖為外交官員履新伊始之禮節上的訪問、但聞馬氏於談話之中、曾有所表示、其大要為維希政府與中國政府睦誼甚殷、法租界內之中國合法機關、法方自仍一本旣往、予以至誠之合作云云、觀此、外傳法租界驚務當局與法院方面已有隔膜之謂、不攻自破、更無待於詞費矣、</p>
<p>法院當局　否認一切</p>
<p>平明社記者昨為法院被接收事、於昨日下午、赴西愛咸斯路高三分院趨訪該院　威方面、就上項消息叩詢意見、承其以極慎重之語氣否認此訊、據稱、此項謠傳、大約起於一週以前、緣日本新總領掘內干城於旬日前向法租界當局司法顧問杜格提出非正式要求、將法租界兩法院移交、杜當時不加可吾、僅將此項耍求、允許轉達行將來滬之法新總領馬傑禮、迨馬總領抵滬、對於此項要求、當經拒絕、並表示須維持現狀、事隔三四日、法駐華大使戈思默由重慶致電新總領馬傑禮稱、法院問題、須絕對維持現狀、乃外界不明眞相、謠諑紛紜、實則並無其事云、又據特一法院負食方面表示、外報所傳、全非事實、記者復在該院及第二特區地方法院視察一週、兩院照常辦公、由捕房派有裝甲警備車嚴密保護、別無如何異伏、</p>

<h3>法大使館　重要聲明　否認法德談判謠傳</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社本埠消息、法國駐華大使館、頃於本日在此間發表聲明稱、「關於法德兩國所進行之談判、本埠各報所載消息、其性質輒屬別有用意、本大使館茲願將絨國負責方面所發出之正式否認、重言以申明之、所有關於（一）法德進行初步和議、（二）法國領土轉讓、（三）法國以軍略根據地聽由德國或義國借用、（四）法國本部或屬地任何地方主權剝削之一切謠傳、均屬向壁虛搆、絕無根據」</p>
<h3>美撤僑輸預訂船位　近四千人　美政府不佽助旅費　美僑團體籌劃補救</h3>
<p>關於撒退美國在華僑民、美國政府業已派遣四艦東來、「蒙德萊及「馬列波薩」二號、預訂行程、可於下月二日及十日先後抵滬、已誌前報、茲來第三艘船「華盛頓」號、亦已有確期、為下月十七日、運戴美僑撤退、於二十一日駛往馬尼拉、二十三日到達、二十五日自馬尼拉直駛洛杉磯、約十二月八日可到、至關於</p>
<p>船票售價雖經減低、現仍非全部旅華美僑每人均能負担、蓋多數美僑、在華就業、薪金均按法幣計算、而票價則售美金、中美兩國貨幣比率、相差太大、故仍須再予核減、美僑　國後、就業問題、亦為困難之一端、因一旦離華回國、須另謀棲枝也、以上二點、為撤退上之困難、雖巳由本埠美僑方面向華盛頓呼籲、請予考量補救辦法、但聞美國務院已發表政府並無基金足以資助、美僑方面、雖略感困難、但本埠美僑申請預定艙位者、已近四千人、對於　務院此項通吿、並無影響、蓋彼等已設法購得船票矣、據美國總統郵船公司當局稱、響應國務院之勸吿</p>
<p>準備撤退返美之美僑約四千人、其情形並不因華盛頓之通告而有所變動、惟本埠美僑聯合會及美國商會、正在考慮此事、其中最大之困難、在於匯兌一項、蓋本埠美僑薪水階級之收入、均以法幣計算、而返美之旅費、則需美金、以彼等所有之法幣折合美金、固相差甚大也、</p>
<h3>公共租界中西巡捕　明日檢閱　在萬國商團操演廳</h3>

<h3>滬越航綫仍重要　添輸行駛　已臨時租用船隻</h3>
<p>滬越航運、自滇緬公路開防後、越南雖已失其對中國內地之重要性、但所產之米煤、須運滬銷售、而本市疋日用品等物、亦為越南所需要者、故滬越航運、仍佔重要地位、</p>
<p>法商增輸　行駛滬越</p>
<p>自日軍在海防等陸後、英商輪隻奉海軍部命令放棄滬越綫航運、本埠英商輪隻、卽改駛香港邏邏新加坡等處、而法商輪乘時興起、駛越之法輪、除業已駛往越南之金第安及羅斯外、法國郵船公司並臨時租用船隻、以需要、行駛上海海防西貢之間、今日又有到滬者、為貨船松泰號、而該公司經理之朋名克號輪、明日亦可到滬、該兩輪此决由越駛滬、載有貢米及眞珠米、迨卸貨完畢後、仍將繼續駛越、上月間滬防復航時、英商駛越輪隻、的每週二艘、目下法商駛越輪隻、總數僅有五艘、故此後或有增加之可能、</p>
<p>達得南輪　駛新航綫</p>
<p>法公司郵船達得南號、停航西貢已久、現該公司在遠東另闢新航綫、各情巳屢誌木報、茲悉該郵船自西貢起程、經小呂宋來滬、昨午抵埠、停靠虹口順泰碼頭、乘客亦有七八十人、該輪的下月四日、自滬赴神戶、的出月十一二日回滬、屆時躭攔一日、卽赴小呂宋回返西貢、嗣後該綸卽由西貢起程赴小呂宋、由小呂宋來滬赴日、由日　來滬、由滬赴小呂宋返西貢、來回香港均不兼灣、</p>
<p>集團購米盼　自動舉辦</p>
<p>探悉下月初旬、約有一號四西貢洋米十五萬包左右、抵達上海、該項米糧成交價格、據稱每包為七十九元、同時近日各米業行號乘此外滙鬆動洋米產價低落之時咸紛紛委託各該洋行代為電洽、成交巨量貢米、上海米糧評價委員會常務委員朱子香氏、昨曾建議於該會、以將來洋米來源、不無問題、同時國內產米區產價不一、及搬運困難、大量運、滬似鮮把握、雖盛傳有弛禁可能、為未雨綢繆、深盼各界踴躍參加集團購米、或自動發起集團購米、勿再將每日所需食米、仰購於各米號、關於洋米評價原則、給以百分之五合法利潤、雖經兩租界當局核准、上海米糧評價委員會曾於前日召開會議從長協商、僉以目前米市塲成立之洋米市價較諸產價低落五元左右、若將洋米評價原則、尅期付諸實施、則市價勢將遞增五元一擔以上、非但不能將米價予以評低、且將市價增高、終非善策、故該項原則、待洋米市價看高時、再予以實施、俾有所限制、屆時收效定必較大、故該會已着手調查洋米產價、卽日函報兩租界當局備查、同時將供諸報端、俾各界知曉、昨晨米市塲開做後、復繼續下落、據悉此純係來源湧旺、人心軟弱所致、</p>

<h3>紹興各機關遷回　電訊剋日恢復　日向柯橋潰退遺屍纍纍　浙省征防空基金一千萬</h3>
<p>竄援紹興城區日軍、經華方有力部　開到猛攻後、巳突圍退向柯橋錢淸一帶、舟山日軍二百餘巳他調、定海日軍有撇退模樣、</p>
<p>城廂克復</p>
<p>自蓋山三江口向東流竄日軍、於二十五日、自漓者越過柯橋、竄抵紹典城郊後、卽發生激烈戰事、激戰至二十六日下午、小股日軍百餘名、被竄入城區、發生港戰、駐軍卽轉移有利地形、開始向城區圍攻、新銳部隊、亦源源開到、二十八日拂曉起、華軍雷雨反攻、反復衝殺、先將東湖收復、繼續向五雲門進攻、日勢窮力蹙、在城南縱火掩蔽、華軍奮勇衝入城中、日猶負嵎頑抗、巷戰至為猛烈、激戰至下午四時、日勢不支、突團衝出西郭門、向柯橋錢淸一帶潰退、華軍卽收復城內各據點、並搜素殘日、一面派隊跟蹤、向西面追擊、日軍極呈狼狽、沿途遺棄軍實及屍體甚多、</p>
<p>機關遷回</p>
<p>紹興專員公署暨縣政府·縣黨部·警察局·等各機關、自二十九日起、相繼返城辦公、惟城內遭此洗劫、房屋被焚過半、難民流離失所、無家可歸者甚衆、亟待救濟善後、上海與紹興間電報、據大通社記者向美商通訊社探詢、尚未恢復、當由紹興城區電報機械撤離城區、尚未裝復所致、一二日內、卽可恢復通報、至旅滬浙人、聞此捷音、靡不歡忻鼓舞、</p>
<p>防控基金</p>
<p>浙省府以日機近日到處肆虐、人民感受威脅日甚、良由防禦器械及消防用具、如高射砲救火車等、無力購滿、查全浙二千萬人民、以每人捐五角計、（無力出錢者由有錢者代出）卽可立集一千萬基金、以之充實防控設備、不僅消極的足以减少損失、且可積極地予以打擊、特擬具詳細辦法、省府以現時各縣所收防空經費、如防護設備費·會員徵　費·違返防空法令罰金·及歷年徵收之房租等、名稱旣不統一、保管亦無專人、稽核動支、兩感困難、決組織防空基金保管委員會、直隸省基保會、所有關於防護上之各種款項、統由該會經管收支、</p>

<h3>越南歸客談　日軍無法侵滇　當地法人反對屈辱協定　日在越南抱有經濟野心</h3>
<p>政府對於日方要求、完全屈服後、法　越南雖仍由法人管轄、而法國三色旗亦高懸、惟街頭日兵充斥、日方軍用用飛機、亦翱翔空際、日方現屯兵於越南京區、區、並接管三處飛機塲、以鞏固其地位、同時竭力籠絡當地民衆、駐海防與飛機塲之日兵、佔半數以上、</p>
<p>對日屈服　異常沮喪</p>
<p>越南法方人土、因維希政府與日方訂立屈辱協定、頗為沮喪、而抱必敗之悲觀態度、外來援助之希望、業已放棄、諒山戰事、因法日雙方內部紛亂而起、蓋協定於丸月二十三日午後三時簽定、至千後十時、忽有日軍一路、擅自行動、進攻諒山、發生戰事、共歷三日、惟法方所發命令、自相矛盾、致僅某數地點增加抵抗、嗣後日軍在海防登岸、未遇抗拒、</p>
<p>不滿現狀　同情抗戰</p>
<p>越南境內法人、同情賡績抗戰之特戈蘭將軍者頗夥、殊不滿於現況、但彼等所處地位、不容其聯合行動、以反對越南法當局擁護維希之政策、越南境內法人與外僑不足四萬人、總人口則達二　三百萵人、土人於政局、　不關切、</p>
<p>日方西冀　攫取資源</p>
<p>日方對於越南、在經濟上亦抱野心、巳派出經濟使節團、料將與越南方面商釀成重大戰事、泰國所提要求、原頗苛嚴、現巳修改、乃希望不用武力、得其欲取之地、今料越南與泰國不致生嚴重戰爭、</p>
<p>華方截路　鞏固邊防</p>
<p>以中國而言、已將滇越鐵路截斷、　　炸　、以固邊防、惟越南　軍並無窺淺之象、僅派機　越南北部根據地飛往中國肆虐、由於地勢關係、日軍若國從越南侵華、非常困難、</p>

<p>倫敦二十九日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>會德豐等派息</h3>
<p>英商正廣和有限公司、定於十一月十二日分派一九四〇年份普通股中期股息、每股國幣二元五角、</p>
<p>英商會德豐有限公司定於十二月五日分派裁至一九四〇年三月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣五元、又該公司經理之英商茂泰有限公司定於十二月四日分派一九四〇年中期股息、每股國幣四元、又上海拖駿有限公司亦定十二月四日分派一九四〇年份普通股中期股息、每股國幣四十元、及優先股上半年股息、計年息三厘五毫、合規元一兩七錢五分、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗價破二百元關　一日間跌落三十餘元</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、且跌風漸起、此因客銷不暢、同時稍有利於空頭謠諑、因之市態戰弱、及空方拋賣活躍、目前紗市多空兩方、皆有相當的力量、上升已久、或有一度盤旋、亦未可知、查棉紗今日有一千九百八十件、運往香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣尙佳、二十支雙馬威一千二百三十二元、少頃漲至一千二百三十二元、旋後因外滙放長、實需淸澹、又復跌至一千二百二、十元、但空頭活動抵補、又漲至一千二百五十五元、豈料交易所行情不佳、浮多又來了結、檯面允鬆、市況直跌至一千二百〇七元、查半日間成交統計五千九百三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十七元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行五、七〇〇杳港　一二〇</p>
<p>溫州　二〇統計五、九三〇</p>
<p>午後棉紗布續趨下落、且跌風殊熾、傅言交易所行情下跌、所以空頭大為活動、二十支雙馬始做一千二百〇七元、繼敲破二百元關口、為一千一百九十五元、最後做到一千一百九十七元、有人要進云、</p>
<h3>巴西棉定一批</h3>
<p>現棉情形稍帶平疲、因紗市回下、人氣略鬆、且巴西棉訂開一批、所以廠方需要不旺、同行納　亦滯云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約檔市市況稍形活　、後又因華爾街股票價格之堅定、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格較之上日漲二三磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續靜寂異常、各方俱以匯兌之未能穩定、故咸抱觀望能度、然市上原棉存底之不　、棉價不致下跌、目前之情況、祇暫呈呆滯之象也、</p>
<h3>雜糧　喜吃奶油五象豆　蠶豆交好運　黃豆依然不景氣</h3>
<p>近來市奶油五香豆頗盛行、故落令之蠶豆、竟然　運亨通、市氣堅　異常、加以來源匱乏、底積枯薄、（約大小粒靑白意衹有七八千包）銷塲有出口、本街團胡搜辦、故潛勞頗緊俏、咋成交吳江揀靑五十包、價為二十六元五角、通貨三百包、價為二十三元、南翔靑蠶三百五十餘包、價為二十一允一角至二十一元八角、祟明靑蠶百除包、價為二十元零六角半、沙蠶二百包、價為二十四元至二十四元五角、嘉定白蠶三百餘包、價味二十四元六角、蕪湖小粒白蠶四百包、價為二十二元三角、　邇來黃豆市面頗不景氣、銷塲又不暢、來源則不斷、以致萎疲之勢、依然存在、昨祗成交天津豆二百四十包、價為四十元至三十九元五角、及靑島豆五十包、價為三十四元五角、</p>
<h3>糧食　新到八千噸米　苞米占五千餘噸　一般米價尙屬平定</h3>
<p>昨日有大批洋米、由西貢裝法輸達得南號直接運來、已預誌咋報、茲悉該輪已於昨日中午抵滬、運來洋米八干噸中、計有苞米（卽珍珠米）五千零六十七噸、洋米二千三百二十四噸、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、又悉法公司貨輸松泰號、今日亦可到埠、聞自西貢運來大量洋米·苞米、計有九于順之鉅、米之確數容輪到後續報、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米近日到頭部絕於途、本市存底逐漸加厚、而銷路除本街舖作稍有點綴外、客囤胃口早經停頓、即投機浮戶亦以市價步落中無利可圖而歇手、市面乃乘自然趨勢、逐次盤削、國外定貨二號西貢即裝袛七十一元、惟因近期船位不足、昨資多洋行接洽之五百噸或須改遲裝船、英華司回箱路貨早晨尙有七十一元至喊聲、因定價低廉、繼以七十元零五角跌開一百五十噸、現貨高次各檔在早市步降中曾有店囤趁低問津、故結果祇盤小四五角、成交數則有七八千包、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種野稻等共到一千五百餘石、內中窰種祇六七十石、一時貨稀胃香、頃刻提高半元至一元、不過新粳及野稻供求相仿、僅呈定局、杜羊尖亦然相仿、計開靑角窰種七十五元七十四元半、崑山新粳七十一元半至七十元、原包七十七元至七十三元、泗涇野稻七十九元至七十七元、杜尖斛見六十六元半至六十四元、廠特七十一元、羊尖六十六元、破　並無變化、常幫高破售八十五元、南港早破原包七十八元、斛見七十七元至七十元、糯米零躉去路依然滯澀、而市上洋糯頗多、貨主均有鬆脫之意、致國糯遂被帶疲、同落五六角至元許、開宜溧白元七十五元、常丹七十四元半至七十三元、香港特自七十二元决至六十八元、</p>
<h3>粉廠供量增多</h3>
<p>麵粉、昨日粉市不脫鬆疲、之局、蓋自近日廠方供量增多後、本街需用頗為寬裕、更有普通洋粉在市搭銷、故市面已少進展、回籠貨老軍棧單十八元七八角、本街偶有點綴而已、洋粉以定貨在途不久將到、人心亦虛弱、統市除華廠紛批出八九千包外、其他交易頗稀、市面尚在看軟中、</p>
<p>小麥　咋市依然擯持、查內地來源久稀、國外來貨亦靜、在邇日粉市看疲聲中、市面欲收亦難、各廠進價、大都限制原盤、而供者寥廖、除少數附近麥偶有零星解送日廠外、其餘概無正式交易、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布期貨交易　已占少數…概多現墊</h3>
<p>廠布昨市平穩、蓋近來同業交易、槪多現墊、期貨交易僅占少數、故屆月底交割期、市面殊少風波、售盤粗細布色布漂布大盤不動、小額手貨每疋廉二角半之譜、浙間幫添辦色布色斜等二百餘件、夸港幫辦色布漂布等二百數十件、北路烟台幫辦粗布斜紋絨一百數十件、本街成交各貨四百餘件、南洋幫辦色布漂斜等五千餘疋、三十一日有疋頭三百八十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布咋以取引所紗價又跌、浮戶鬆售、龍頭細布回降每疋七角半、至三十六元四角半、收盤中檔細布與細斜僅跌四五角、蓋本街實銷未衰、同業仍有乘廉收進、交易尚盛、四君子嗶嘰收盤價每碼一元一角三分半、</p>
<h3>煤炭　大連炭乘隙而入</h3>
<p>柴炭市塲、自溫炭吿罄後、無貨應市、交易幾如停頓、市上雖傳大生輪已進甌江封皴纏、但因初次通航、水脚奇昂、柴炭粗物、一時亦難裝運、惟日昨某洋行有大連草包炭抵埠、在市塲兜銷、每包售日金十四元、（合法幣念一元出外）、因成本昂貴、殊稀交易也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　中茶開始買茶</h3>
<p>今庚皖浙贛各省紅緑茶自改歸中茶公司接辦後、據屯溪來信該路紅綠茶、巳於本月十五日起、開始採辦、　祁門紅茶、頭批貨定價三百三十元、二批貨定價二百十元、三批貨定價一百二十元、屯溪婺源抽珍定價二百一二十元、普通珍眉定價一百六十元、其餘各路貨均依等級定價照現時價格、較上年提高百分之十五、一般茶商對此均認為滿意云、三十一日有茶葉三百四十二件運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平穩如舊</h3>
<p>咋糖市趨勢平平、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十二元、外棧七十一元七角、轉口討五十七元五角、未成交、太古車白B嘜西棧七十元五角、東棧七十元、DY嘜西棧六十六元三角、HHX嘜東棧六十五元五角、HM嘜西棧六十三元五角、荷赤現貨起初五十四元二角、後回全五十四元、路貨十一月十八日打單者五十四元五角、升一角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蜜棗升十餘元</h3>
<p>蜜棗近因到貨無繼、市上存底漸見單薄、因此價乃回振、前後步升十餘元、現市行盤、嘉興禿禿售一百五十元、上下檔照例加退、</p>

<h3>未完成的傑作</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>「怎麽，你就那麼悄悄地走過去了嗎？你不翻翻這個？不跟我們一同寫上一點嗎？</p>
<p>『這未完成的傑作』—是一部多偉大的史詩呵！充滿了不斷的，火熱的鬥爭：人對自然，人對人的鬥爭！善和惡，光明和黑暗，公理和强權的鬥爭！</p>
<p>『血肉的門爭！生的歡喜！死的悲哀！</p>
<p>『我們的祖先們不息地創造它。但其中也有努力破壞的，那就是有幾葉上的關於暴力的讚美，獨夫的謳歌。</p>
<p>『但我們到底由野蠻而到達文明！</p>
<p>『只要翻一翻！冉想像一下：這「未完成的傑作」，是經過了多少隻手的創作，整理，篡改，塗抹！耗費了多少人的心血！</p>
<p>『現在是應該我們來創作，整理的時候了。我們有現成的，多出色的主題：「集團和集團的鬥爭！集團對自然的鬥爭！』</p>
<p>『某些人，某些集團，要把它纂改，塗抹。打擊他們！打倒他們！這時代那裹冉容得暴力的讚美，獨夫的謳歌</p>
<p>『如果需要流血，流，儘流，為了使這「未完成的傑作」更豐富，更完善。</p>
<p>「怎麼，你害怕嗎？請你翻翻。或者跟我們一同寫上一點。這不只是使你「留名」的事呀！</p>
<p>『我們要努力把它弁得好一點，在交代我們的子孫們之前。猶如我們的祖先把它授給我們一樣。』</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>憶大哥</h3>
<p>— 劉雲</p>
<p>神志模糊的時候，眼前常常現出大哥的影子，仍舊和先前一樣的憔悴和幽默。耳邊也散播着大哥所愛唱的「畢業歌」的洪壯的歌聲。這是因為大哥所給予我的印象太深了，所以我的臘海中始終刻着大哥的影子，永遠不會消滅。</p>
<p>勇敢的有為的親愛的大哥，他居然打碎了天倫聚歡之樂，忍痛離開了他生平最敬孝的人—母親，分別了最鍾愛的弟弟和妹妹，投向祖國的懷抱裹去了！這是一九三九年九月三日的一個月色淡暗的晚上所發生的事悄，到現在還沒有接到他從遠地寄來的佳音，不知現在飄流在何方。</p>
<p>在故鄉，一個初夏的早晨，血紅的太陽，慢慢地從東山升起，大地上的一切都表現出生氣，漁見浮在澄淸的水面上自由地游着，大哥枯瘦的手，扶在我的肩上，我挾了二本小說書，拿一袋餅乾，和大哥靠得緊緊地步着，二姊拿了三根釣桿，唱着漁光曲」，跟在我們後面。走到屋後的池塘邊放下了釣竿，坐在樹陰下的太湖石上，大哥右手撫摩着我的頭頂，左手握着二姊的手，帶着鼓勵的口吻說：「二妹雲弟，你們的天資比我聰明得多，而且你們沒有遭受巨大的封建侵襲，因為在你們知事的時候，家庭的封建思想，差不多巳經給我克服了，所以你們的思想是很純潔的，我要幫助你們走入正確的道路，使你們將來成個有用的人。」這是三年前的事，如今偶一涉想，此狀如在目前。</p>
<p>的確大哥幫助了我們學術上的成就，介紹我們讀正當的書籍，領導我們過集團生活，參加音樂會，運動會。那時的我，小心中沒有一刻不懷着天眞的快樂。臉上露出天眞的微笑。</p>
<p>和大哥分別的時候，他握着我的手很懇切地說：「希望你們跟着我的脚印走上光明的大道。」二姊楚有志氣的，她眞的在一星期以前跟着大哥的脚印走了，剩下來的只有他們孤獨可憐的弟弟—我。我不知大哥的生死存亡，沒法見到他那枯瘦的面頰，只能拿了他的照相瘋在地大哭一塲！</p>
<p>不知何年何月，大哥的右手再能夠撫摩着我的頭頂，左手握着二姊，坐在樹底下的大湖石上。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十章皮鞋問題</p>
<p>霍桑道：「他穿的什麼衣服？」老毛道：「當然是西裝。」我暗忖「當然」的字樣不免有些可疑。趙伯雄在早展被捕的時候是穿着中裝的。不過他釋放以後，又換穿西裝，那也說不定。</p>
<p>我向霍桑說：「如果是他，這倒又麻煩。你想崔廳長的保證可靠不可靠？」</p>
<p>霍桑瞧着地上的李老頭兒，緩緩地說：「我不願意借重他的保證。我要親手捉住這傢伙。不過先決問題，這回事是不是他幹的，還待研究。」他用手指指地上的李芝範。「槍彈還在他胸膛裹，不曾透過—我想他不會死，也許他還能設話。」</p>
<p>我答道：「如果能說話，那最好。不過那姓趙的傢伙，無論如何，總有把他找來的必要。你說要親牛捉住他，有沒有把握？」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「以前沒有，現在却不同了。」</p>
<p>這時候一陣波叭波叭的聲響，警廳裹的救護車巳開到了。倪金壽就從那車上跳下來。他先驚慌地瞧瞧地上的李芝範，才向霍桑說話。「不得了！又是一件血案！那怎麼辦？」「霍桑答道：：你別慌。現在先把他送到醫院裹去，也許還有救。」</p>
<p>倪金壽向那車上幾個穿曰色制服的人招招手。兩個人便照樣抬着羿牀下來，走到李芝範旁邊。不到三分鐘功夫，那汽車已載送李芝範往醫院裹去。</p>
<p>霍桑先向老毛揮揮手叫他進屋子裹去，隨後向　金壽說道：「據老毛說，他聽得槍聲奔出來時，還瞧見趙伯雄的背影。」</p>
<p>倪金壽驚呼說：「什麼！又是他幹的？這個人有着某種　山，委實吃不消他。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「是小是他幹的，這還難說。不過我們總有再見見趙先生的必要。」</p>
<p>倪金壽向街的左右望了一望。「松泉跟荷生在那　？他們總應當瞧見。」（一五二）</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>盡量參加社會活動</h3>
<p>— 人韋</p>
<p>我們並不是極端主義者，說什麼婦女要踏上社會須待整個社會解放之後才能實現，而放棄了目前可能的，局部的改進；我認為：卽使動員一個或者二個婦女去參加社會活動，那對於整個婦女解放運動就是一個助力。根據這個原則，那末像陳銘君的那位『富有組織力』的夫人，是應該儘可能來替社會做些事情的，「糠搓繩起頭難」，婦女參加社會活動的鐵門巳略被打開的現在，你還裹足不前嗎？</p>
<p>所以我的結論是這樣：曾在學校讀媧書或者沒有讀過書的，而現在是等在家中「配人」的年靑女子們，趕快從家庭里跑出來，去到社會上做你能夠做的事情。家有傭人的知識婦女們，也應該儘可能來做些家庭以外的事情。這不但是鍛鍊你們自己，也是為你們的女孩子開條生路呵！</p>
<h3>設若</h3>
<p>— 鍾肯</p>
<p>設若人生是在演戲吧</p>
<p>我將立在台上作正義的呼喊！</p>
<p>設若人生是一片浮雲吧，</p>
<p>我也將凝成雨滴掉向大地！</p>

<h3>好萊塢觀光記（上）</h3>
<p>— 程志政自　洛杉磯寄</p>
<p>爲了要觀光名聞全球的影國首都，記者在歸國途次特地繞道到美國西南部的洛杉磯城。</p>
<p>好萊塢在一般人的理想中，總以為是一座很大的糜登都市，實際上它不過是洛杉磯城附近的小鎮罷了。是一個深秋的早晨，記者在旅館農餐之後，很興奮的打聽到好萊塢的途徑，原來好萊塢離開洛杉磯的莫十哩光景，電車公共汽車都可直達，記者乘了二十分鐘的公共汽車，遠遠便望見對面幾座蔚然深秀的山峯，林薄間矗立着一排霓虹燈字母，仔細一看，原來來是Hollywoodland（好萊塢）幾個大字。</p>
<p>我們如果就字義去解釋，那麼好萊塢正是「冬靑林」的意思，原來好萊塢的氣候，終年皆春，彷彿有些像新加坡。而山勢迂廻，樹木蓊翳，又極擅林園之勝，稱它為冬靑林」是再適合沒有了。由洛杉磯到好萊塢，沿途滿植椰樹，迎飛搖曳，更增加了無限的詩情畫　。</p>
<p>不久，我們的汽車便到了好萊塢中心的好萊塢大街，當我在街頭躑躅的時候，似乎發生了一種異樣的感覺，覺得在熙熙攘攘的人羣中必定有發現幾顆亮晶晶明星的可能。所以我一面走，一面留心着往來不絕的行人，結果雖然沒有遇到什麽明星，但的確看到不少的美麗女子，大概就是候補明星吧。</p>
<p>好萊塢鎮上的繁華，是不言可喻的，商店裹的珠光寳氣，十足顯示出道座影國首都的特色！記者在好萊塢街走了些時，忽然看到一所「中國戲院「（Graumans　Chinese）這是好萊塢鎮上最講究的電影院，却不是中國人開的，為什麽要用中國兩字來作院名，我也沒有詳細打聽，戲院的建築固然採取中國式，就是售票的女職員，也各人披上一套「雙龍戲珠」的中國式綢衣。最有趣的，是戲院前水門汀上，印着許多大明星的足印手印，由各人在印的下面，簽上自己的姓名，還寫上一兩句話，都是給院主的。娶了四次妻現在正鬧著離婚的約翰巴勃摩亞，不但留了手印腳印，還親自印上面部的輪廓，我細細看看，有些明星已經不在人世了，有些老牌明星，現在已不再現身影幕了，前者如范朋克，後者如　琳格許，秀蘭　波兒最近退隱，她的小手脚也特別值得懷戀。</p>
<h3>茹富蘭論（上）</h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>從北方武生說起北方武生自楊小樓俞振亭相繼作古尚和玉年老退休後，學現在的情形講，可以分成兩輩人物，老一輩的是周瑞安孫毓堃茹富蘭，小一輩的是李萬春。吳彥衡。劉宗揚。楊盛春。李盛斌。高盛麟。王金璐。傳德威諸人。如果要在藝術方面，下絕對的斷語的話，以目前而論，小一輩的沒有一個比得上老一輩，至於老一輩的三個人中，周瑞安演戲過火，自不及孫茹兩人，孫茹二人相較，則各有千秋，難分軒輊，最近茹富蘭應聘來滬，內外行人仕一致贊美，風頭之健駕乎以往所來之諸武生之上，可見「有目共賞」，爰將富蘭之藝分而論之。</p>
<p>根基茹富蘭為茹萊卿之孫，茹錫九之子，萊卿坐科小榮椿科班，得楊榮壽之眞傳，榮壽為近三十年來武生第一家，是故富蘭家學淵源，不同流俗，富蘭坐科富連成，原習小生，後改武生，在科時得蕭長華董鳳年親授，小生戲文武不擋，程鏈喜出利後，富蘭　連喜而為富連成當家小生，演「奇雙會」「羣英會」「戰濮陽」等小生戲，在科時卽負盛名，改武生後，以「金鎖陣」「金蘭會」二戲開蒙，繼學楊（榮壽）派傑作之「探莊」「夜奔」「蜈蚣嶺」以及「狀元印」「挑滑車」「麒麟閣」等靠把戲，則係萊卿所傳，故富蘭雖係出自富連成，但其得自富連成者，為小生戲，其武生戲悉係家傳，亦即間接藝宗楊榮壽也。</p>
<p>優點今之一般後起武生，根基皆不及前輩人物，此並非每況愈下，最大原因，卽今之教師無一能及過去之老先生也。同時亦因受潮流之支配，今之科班已不若昔時之嚴厲，而後起人物，正因失却嚴厲之管束，而難奠定良好基礎。</p>

The Japanese army near Shaoxing was completely cleared. The remnants of the Japanese army fled to Xiaoshan. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,400 casualties. Currently, the local Chinese authorities are actively comforting refugees and stabilizing order. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Military News from Longzhou: (1) The Japanese army in Longzhou City has completely retreated to Pingxiang. The Chinese army has completely recaptured Longjin Pass. (2) The Chinese army has successively captured Shanwei, Xichang, and other places. There is no trace of the Japanese in the vicinity of these two places. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanning: (1) The Chinese army, counter-attacking Nanning from the Yongwu Road, and the Chinese army, counter-attacking Nanning from the Yongbin Road, simultaneously captured Nanning City at dawn today. The citizens once again saw the Blue Sky White Sun flag and cheered along the way. (2) The Chinese army crossed the Yong River southward to pursue the Japanese. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, the Chinese military spokesperson strongly refuted the Japanese claim of voluntarily withdrawing from Nanning, saying that the Japanese army's position in Nanning was already untenable after the Chinese counter-offensive. The spokesperson expressed the opinion that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning might suggest a Japanese plan to concentrate efforts on their southward advance. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: The Chinese army on the Yongwu Road captured Gaofeng'ao at 12 noon on the 29th and continued to advance south. At 2 pm, they successively captured the key points of Xinwei and Datang. The Jiandao Weir northeast of Nanning was also recaptured at 12 noon. Furthermore, the vanguard of the Chinese troops entered Nanning City at 7 pm on the 29th. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army in southern Guangxi decisively captured Nanning, and the Japanese army retreated in panic, suffering huge losses. It is reported that the main force of the Japanese army in the Nanning area totaled more than 40,000 men. After being besieged by the Chinese army day and night, most of them have already dispersed, and some have retreated into Qinzhou and other places in Guangdong Province. Their destination seems to be Hainan Island. From then on, the position of the Japanese army in southwestern Guangxi and Guangdong provinces will be quite difficult. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The Washington Evening Star newspaper published a commentary yesterday, stating that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning indicates that China is strong enough to drive the Japanese out of important strongholds. According to Japanese claims, the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning was purely voluntary because the occupation of Nanning had become meaningless after the Japanese army entered Vietnam. The Evening Star reported that the Japanese army occupied this important town in Guangxi on November 24, 1939. The Evening Star stated that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning and the Chinese army's reoccupation of the city have aroused great interest in the United States this week. The occurrence of this event indicates that the Chinese side, having obtained continued credit loans from the United States and military supplies transported in via the Burma Road, has been able to prolong the war, causing Japan to abandon its risky war due to economic exhaustion. Undoubtedly, if China lives the life of islanders in central Asia for one day, Japan will not be able to fulfill its threatening ability to the Western interests in the Far East for one day.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese War Situation and the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>The flames of the European War are spreading towards the Balkan Peninsula. The conditions stipulated in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, that each signatory country must assist each other under new circumstances, will first be tested here. Although Japan already has a tendency to evade its obligations, in any case, the expansion of the European War and unrest on the western border of the Soviet Union are things that the Japanese side cannot wish for today, because that is precisely a favorable opportunity for it to engage in new speculation and adventures in the Far East. Therefore, the battle results of the Chinese army in recovering famous cities in the southeast and two battlefields have great significance for the increasingly turbulent Far East crisis.</p>
<p>Japan's southward attempt is, of course, to remedy the failure of the invasion of China, and at the same time, it is sufficient to make its attention and strength on the invasion of China more dispersed. A certain Japanese political theorist previously criticized the Japanese for their fickle-mindedness, talking about going south before the invasion of China had any results. Because Japan's current resources and strength do not allow it to carry out the invasion of China and the south at the same time. And if the southward advance succeeds, it will reduce the Japanese interest in invading China. If it suffers setbacks, it will inevitably increase the downturn in the intention to fight China. The situation shown in the recent Sino-Japanese war situation is sufficient to prove the accuracy of the latter assumption, because the Japanese army's encounters on the Chinese battlefield are following the setbacks in its southward activities.</p>
<p>Judging from the war situation over the past six months, since the central Hubei campaign in the spring and summer, there have been relatively few large-scale strategic battles. The Japanese claim to invade Sichuan and Yunnan are nothing more than empty words. The so-called autumn offensive is only a strategic embellishment for the so-called mopping-up operations in southern Anhui and western Zhejiang. The Chinese army's counterattack has achieved significant results at this time. The eastern battlefield has recovered Jingxian, Lin'an, Zhuji, and even Shaoxing, an important town in eastern Zhejiang. The southern battlefield has recovered Nanning and Longzhou Mingjiang Suilu and other places, the inland invasion bases that the Japanese army has held for years. The nature of these two battles is different, the former is the contest between "mopping up" and "counter-mopping up", the latter is the competition for strategic strongholds, but they are both major achievements of the Chinese army's strategy and tactics. It proves that the Japanese army is not only unable to defend the newly occupied cities, which is very different from the previous attack, that is, immediately build fortifications, engage in a desperate defense, and even the important bases that have been operated for a long time cannot be guaranteed. It opens a new era in which the Chinese army recovered important towns in the past three years. The ratio of strength between the two armies, the situation of attack and defense, should all be estimated with new scales from now on. The effectiveness of the Chinese counterattack, especially in southern Guangxi, is also a major blow to the Japanese southward attempt.</p>
<p>The Japanese invasion of southern Guangxi last winter was originally a manifestation of a two-pronged policy. On the one hand, they wanted to use the Qinfang Yongning stronghold to prepare to invade the southwest hinterland. On the other hand, they just used it as a pretext to look south into Vietnam. At that time, China repeatedly urged the countries concerned to pay attention, but the French-Vietnamese authorities remained ignorant, procrastinated, and made mistakes, and never prepared for it before the defeat in Europe. Eventually, French-Vietnamese rights and interests suffered significant damage not long ago, and this crisis is still continuing to grow. After Japan advanced into northern Vietnam, the Yonglong stronghold had already reduced its role in invading Vietnam, but whether the Japanese continued to advance south or invade west, the Guangxi area of Yonglong was a very valuable rear, enough to be a strategic point with the Haiphong-Hanoi line, and it has significant strategic and transportation significance. Therefore, if it is said that the Japanese army may as well abandon Yonglong because the Vietnam negotiations have been resolved, it is obviously just a rhetoric to cover up the defeat, just like the previous battles in northern Hunan and northern Hubei. After Yonglong returns to Chinese control, not only can Yunnan be spared the danger of being attacked on both sides, but the Chinese army's position in southern Guangxi is also sufficient to pose a new threat. Although the Japanese Navy is still intact and the results of its secret shipbuilding over the past three years and the performance of its new ships that have been launched are not known to outsiders, there is indeed reason to believe that the fact that the invading Japanese army has shown a shortage of military power and has suffered repeated defeats shows that even if the Japanese Navy is well equipped, its actual combat power may not be very different from its troops in China, because it is equally subject to economic resources. The reserves and supplements of manpower and material resources it needs have exceeded the actual capabilities of Japan, which is nearing exhaustion. If it is said that after the invading Chinese army has suffered repeated defeats, it can only rely on its naval strength to complete the southern dream by taking advantage of the opportunity of the expansion of the European War, it is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>The recent victory of the Chinese army's counterattack has indeed proved that China's war of resistance against aggression and the tough policies of Britain and the United States are the basic elements for stabilizing the Far East, and the more successful China is militarily, the more the Far East crisis will decrease. Recently, Japan has encountered setbacks in all aspects. Whether it will combine new military offensives and political offensives to seek a solution to the "China Incident," or turn to use the new international situation to expand its adventures, although it can be asserted that it will be difficult for it to succeed easily, it is something that all relevant parties at home and abroad should pay close attention to.</p>

It is heard that two of the passengers are lower-level government officials, and the rest are businessmen from Chongqing to Kunming to handle affairs. The time when the plane was shot down seems to be 2:30 pm yesterday, because the last radio message was sent at that time.

<p>Two of the Passengers Were Journalists</p>
<p>Chongqing: American pilot Kent of China Airlines, jointly operated by China and the United States, was shot down by Japanese aircraft while flying the Chongqing plane from Chongqing to Kunming yesterday, resulting in his death. There were twelve people on board, including nine passengers, the co-pilot, and a female cadre each. It is feared that many of the others also died. Among them were two famous young Chinese journalists, one was Fan Changjiang, who is currently affiliated with Dagongbao, and the other was Lu Yijun (transliteration), a local correspondent for Xinhua Daily, which is run by the Communist Party of China. Kent was known for his calmness. After Kunming issued an air raid alert, Kent decided to fly the plane back to a temporary landing field in Sichuan Province, but because the field was not suitable for landing, he flew back to Kunming. After entering Kunming, he was attacked by Japanese aircraft in northern Kunming. Kent sent a radio message saying, "The plane is under attack by Japanese aircraft, and he is trying to land." This was Kent's last message. Later, China Airlines learned that the plane had been destroyed and Kent had died. A total of two people survived. As of this morning, Chongqing has not yet received a detailed report. It is found that on the 26th of this month, a Eurasia Airlines aircraft was shot down by Japanese aircraft near Kunming, so two passenger planes have been attacked in one week. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It is now found that the China Airlines Chongqing plane, which was shot down in Zhan Yi on the 29th, was the Guilin plane that was shot down in Zhongshan County on August 24, 27th year, and was repaired and renamed.

<h3>Solid Foundation for China's Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>Moscow: The latest issue of the "World Politics and Economy" magazine published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences contains an article by Luo Guofu, former TASS correspondent in China, entitled "China's Wartime Finance." The author stated that the expenses required for the Japanese war are several times greater than those of China. It is generally recognized that Japan is in financial difficulty, and that China's financial situation is relatively stable is due to several purely "Chinese mysteries." The author explained that this situation is due to the fact that every financial measure of the National Government is supported by the people of the whole country. Therefore, it is able to overcome all the difficulties that arise during the war. The abundant resources and large savings owned by the government and the people enable China under the rule of the National Government to extend its cooperation in the war. It is further said that China's savings are several times greater than those of Japan. According to the expectations of Chinese and foreign experts, China's silver reserves are sufficient to maintain three or five years of war. Regarding the various financial measures adopted by the Chinese government, the author pointed out that these measures are sufficient to stabilize China's legal tender and make Japan's attempt to circulate banknotes issued by illegal banks fail. The author concluded that the firm and lasting nature of China's national liberation war and the strengthening of national unity enable China's vast resources to be fully and advantageously used, thereby strengthening the economic foundation of the national liberation struggle.

<h3>Bravely Resisting a Formidable Enemy: Greek Forces Firmly Defend Original Positions; Italian Mechanized Units Find No Purchase; British Navy Lays Mines in Greek Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Reliable sources in Athens report that Greek mountain troops today repulsed modern Italian mechanized units. Covert units, mimicking Chinese guerrilla tactics, are inflicting significant hardship on retreating Italian forces. Despite relentless bombing by Italian aircraft, Greek forces maintain their entire original front line, indicating the failure of Italian attempts to breach Greek resistance. Furthermore, Greek General Headquarters officials state they deeply assess that the main Italian force has yet to advance, instead seeking the weakest point in the Greek defense. Currently, Greek forces are holding off the Italians on land. The British fleet, reportedly steaming north from its Mediterranean base, is poised to engage the Italian navy. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>An Athens Greek General Headquarters communiqué states that small Italian units attacked Greek positions on Monday evening. On Tuesday, heavy and light artillery continued the assault. Greek forces are operating according to prearranged plans. There have been no changes on the West Macedonian front. There was minimal air activity on Tuesday evening. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: According to Athens radio reports, British naval vessels have approached. The Admiralty has declared that strategically important Greek territorial waters, such as the Gulfs of Patras, Corinth, and Aegina, have been mined. Military sources here report that the main Italian offensive in Greece is developing along the coastal area of Konispol. The currently ascertainable Italian force numbers two infantry divisions. Greek coastal outposts have been attacked. As of noon yesterday, Italian forces were reported to have penetrated eight kilometers into Greek territory at Filasteonistra. The Italians have not yet deployed any armored divisions in the aforementioned offensive. Elsewhere on the Greek front, there have only been localized skirmishes. There is no confirmation of reports that Italian forces have landed on various Greek islands. No British forces are stationed there. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek frontline defenders are reportedly retreating along the entire Albanian border. Yesterday, Britain urgently dispatched naval aircraft to provide support, heavily bombing the Italian-held island of Matzaro, part of the Dodecanese archipelago. This island serves as the closest Italian air base to Athens and a springboard for yesterday's Italian air raids on Greece. The British formally declared that the bombing of the island by British naval aircraft constitutes an act of British aid to Greece. This announcement marks the first such instance. Athenian morale is high. However, reliable sources report that the Greek frontline along the Albanian border is buckling under the intense assault of Italian mechanized units. The advancing Italian force of 200,000 has penetrated an average of six miles into Greek territory. It is also reported that Italian vehicles have advanced ten miles at one point. The Italian vanguard is advancing towards Mörsiah, Petra, and Ioannina. Italian Alpine troops, attacking Florina, engaged in fierce fighting with Greek soldiers in kilts. Florina, an important railway junction, is clearly a prime Italian target. Since Monday, Florina has been subjected to artillery and air bombardment, with Italian bombers leading the way, followed by long-range artillery support. Although the first line of Greek defense has begun to collapse, Greek High Command remains satisfied with the progress of military operations in the north. Official reports yesterday stated that the country is "determined to fully aid Greece." Athens was not attacked today. (International News Service dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to information from Tirana, Italian forces breached the Greek defensive line in southeastern Albania yesterday afternoon. It is claimed that after a thirty-hour assault, the Italian forces broke through the line, with the leading units comprised of machine gun teams and mountain-climbing motorcycle units. Following behind are packs of mules transporting mountain guns and ammunition to the front. It is also reported that Italian forces have landed on various islands near the Greek coast. While detailed information is lacking, it is widely believed that Italian forces are attacking other Greek islands, the names of which are being withheld due to military secrecy.

<h3>British Naval Aircraft Heavily Attack the Dodecanese Islands</h3>
<p>London: A British Admiralty communiqué states that aircraft from the British Mediterranean Fleet attacked Matzaro, the capital of Stampalia Island in the Dodecanese archipelago. A hangar and runway were hit and set ablaze, and multiple bombs struck oil depots and ammunition dumps, causing massive explosions. The explosions continued even after the British aircraft had departed. Multiple incendiary bombs were dropped within the target area. All British aircraft returned safely to base. The Dodecanese are the closest Italian air base to Athens. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Naval Battle Erupts as Britain and Italy Vie for Control of the Ionian Islands</h3>
<p>Budapest: It is reported that British and Italian forces simultaneously landed on strategically important islands in the Ionian archipelago yesterday, sparking a fierce battle for control. No updates on the fighting were received here yesterday. Government sources state that enemy forces are pressing forward and engaging in heavy combat. Reports arriving here indicate that Italian forces are advancing along the Albanian border, encountering Greek forces multiple times under extremely difficult conditions. Severe blizzards are sweeping through the mountains. The simultaneous landing of British and Italian forces on the Ionian Islands led to a naval battle off the islands, but no official communiqué has been issued regarding the battle.

<h3>Difficult Terrain in Greece Hinders Italian Advance</h3>
<p>Vichy: Political circles here are keenly interested in the developments of the Italian-Greek war. They note that for two thousand years, Roman armies have attempted to cross the mountainous Adriatic coastline and invade the Macedonian plains to control the Aegean Sea. This is their second attempt. The Italian-Greek border, stretching over a hundred miles from the Adriatic Sea to the Yugoslav border, is entirely mountainous. The Italian army can only launch an offensive along two routes: (1) along the northeastern route of the Greek Pindus Mountains, directly towards Thessaloniki. In this way, the Albanian cities of Vlorë and Argyrokastro, and the entire province, would form a straight line, allowing entry into the Macedonian plains via the Vistritsa River valley; (2) along the coastal road through Ioannina and the Epirus province, directly towards the Gulf of Corinth. There are no other accessible routes. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Allegedly Attempts to Mediate Italian-Greek Conflict</h3>
<p>New York: Today's *Neue Zürcher Zeitung* and *New York Times* carry reports from the Bulgarian and Yugoslav capitals stating that Hitler may be seeking to end the Italian-Greek war. According to the *Neue Zürcher Zeitung*'s correspondent in Sofia, this rumor is prevalent among diplomatic circles there. It is claimed that Hitler was unaware of the Italian invasion of Greece beforehand and does not particularly want to see Greece occupied by Italy. The *New York Times*' correspondent in the Yugoslav capital reports that Berlin believes the Italian-Greek conflict is premature and is concerned about Greece's courageous resistance and Turkey's eventual intervention. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: This morning, official sources here stated that there is hope that the Italian-Greek war will not escalate. The international situation appears to be stabilizing slightly. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Vienna: A political newspaper here carries a dispatch from Berlin stating that if Britain sends significant forces to land in Greece, the Axis powers will take joint action against Greece. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Greek Morale High; Nation Committed to Defending Territory</h3>
<p>Athens: Yesterday, Athens was abuzz with war preparations as the people expressed their determination to defend their country. Anti-Italian sentiment was extremely high after the Security Department announced that Italian aircraft had bombed the port of Patras on Sunday, killing over five thousand and injuring more than one hundred. As Greece entered its second day of war yesterday, Athenians filled the streets of the capital, cheering government and military officials. Residents of Athens were awakened at dawn yesterday, not by air raid sirens as on Monday, but by the cheers of crowds gathered in the squares around the Royal Palace, celebrating the arrival of officers and government officials in Athens. King George II, wearing the uniform of the Greek army's commander-in-chief, was greeted enthusiastically by the people. Another group of people gathered outside the British Embassy. Hundreds of citizens, waving British, Greek, and Thai flags, chanted and sang to express their fervent support for the government's resolve to resist aggression. Twenty British pilots, released from a detention camp due to Greece's wartime needs, were spotted by the crowd, who placed them on their shoulders and paraded them through the streets. Unofficial sources suggested that Britain should bomb Rome in retaliation for the Italian bombing of Athens, believing it to be the most effective way to aid Greece. Greek citizens of British and American descent of military age should organize an international unit to participate in the war. Furthermore, former "Evzones" officers, considered the best troops in the Greek army but dismissed for participating in the 1935 rebellion, have petitioned the King and Prime Minister to join the army. Prime Minister Metaxas has approved their reinstatement. The entire city of Athens is now engaged in defense preparations. Shopkeepers are covering their windows with glass to prevent air raid damage, and air raid wardens are patrolling in steel helmets, appearing quite valiant. Fully armed troops in khaki uniforms constantly pass through the streets of the capital, heading towards the front lines. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Turkey Sympathetic to Greece's Resistance to Aggression; Turkey to Maintain Neutrality if Bulgaria Does Not Join the War</h3>
<p>Athens: Greece's efforts to obtain support from the Balkan Peninsula have achieved some success. Responsible sources here report that Turkey is positioning itself to "neutralize" Bulgaria, enabling Greece to concentrate its army against Italy. Athens has reportedly received assurances from Bulgaria that it intends to remain neutral. Should Bulgaria abandon its neutrality under external pressure, Turkey will provide active assistance to Greece. At the same time, it is widely believed that Turkey is prepared to provide Greece with any material assistance within its power. Press reports also indicate that the Yugoslav people fully support Greece, further reinforcing the Greek belief in their ability to resist the war. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu, in a meeting with Turkish journalists, declared that Turkey will maintain a neutral stance regarding the Italian-Greek dispute. He affirmed that Turkey needs peace and security. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Ankara: Following a telephone conversation between the Greek Prime Minister and the Turkish President, the Turkish cabinet convened on the 28th. The results of the meeting have not yet been announced. According to well-informed sources in Ankara, no firm decisions have been made at present. The Turkish government will adopt a wait-and-see policy. While Turkish newspapers took a reserved approach towards the Italian-Greek war yesterday, most expressed sympathy towards Greece. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Authorities Maintain Silence; Diplomatic Envoys Active in Moscow</h3>
<p>Moscow: Yesterday, Soviet officials remained silent regarding the Italian-Greek war. Soviet newspapers offered no commentary on the matter, simply publishing reports from Rome, Athens, and London. (Haitong dispatch, 30th) ○Moscow: Yesterday, the rapid movements of cars in the foreign quarter of the city indicated intense diplomatic activity concerning the developments in the Balkans. Greek Minister Theophilatopoulos visited British Ambassador Sir Stafford Cripps. It is also reported that the Greek Ambassador met with German Ambassador Count von der Schulenburg. Soviet newspapers report the course of events in the Italian-Greek conflict without offering comment. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky met with the Greek Minister to the Soviet Union, Theophilatopoulos, last night. The content of their discussions was not disclosed, but it is believed that the Italian-Greek dispute was the main topic. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Spokesmen for both the Soviet and Turkish embassies today firmly denied rumors circulating here last night that the Soviet Union had provided Turkey with military guarantees, only to be effective in the event of a German attack on Turkey. British authorities also indicated that the rumors contradicted reliable information. A year ago, the Soviet Union and Turkey discussed forging a military alliance, but the negotiations completely failed because the Moscow government insisted that the alliance must be effective against Germany. Well-informed diplomats here believe that the Soviet Union's future policy will tend towards avoiding any commitment that could provoke war with Germany. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japan Unwilling to Be Drawn into the European War; Disregards Assistance Obligations Despite the Tripartite Pact</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, when meeting with reporters today, addressed the Italian-Greek war, stating that the overall situation remained unclear. Japan does not wish to take immediate action. The Japanese government is currently only observing the actual developments of the Italian-Greek hostilities. When asked whether the Tripartite Pact stipulates mutual assistance among the signatories, the spokesman did not answer, instead repeatedly stating that Japan is watching the situation. When further questioned regarding the reports that Italy did not consult its allies before commencing hostilities, the spokesman said, "Many things are currently underway and cannot all be disclosed to the public." He added that the Japanese government considers a formal declaration of its opinion unnecessary and therefore does not wish to issue a statement. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today's *Miyako Shimbun* declares that, geographically speaking, Japan has no need to assist Italy in its war against Greece. It is stated that while Japan is obligated to assist Italy under the Tripartite Pact, Japan's assistance to Italy seems unnecessary, given the geographical relationship between Japan and Greece. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent states that the slow pace of the Italian advance into Greece has raised doubts in some quarters as to whether the real purpose of Italian actions is to test Japan's commitment to its obligations under the Tripartite Pact. Japan had agreed to provide full assistance should any signatory be at war with a country that was not already at war. Greece has now been attacked by Italy, so this condition is now in effect. However, there is credible reason to believe that the pact contains certain secret clauses that explicitly define "countries not already at war" as referring only to certain designated major powers. In any case, it is likely that Japan would not act automatically on behalf of the Axis powers even under the most favorable circumstances. Japan has surely reserved the right to interpret the terms in its own interest, and is unlikely to be drawn into belligerent status by an attack on a small European nation.

<h3>Spain Does Not Plan to Participate in the War</h3>
<p>Madrid: It is the view of well-informed sources here that Franco's well-known desire to keep Spain out of the war is unlikely to be disappointed. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>France and the Axis Powers in Contract Negotiations; French Military Bases for Use by Germany and Italy; Vichy Government Firmly Denies It</h3>
<p>Washington: The French Embassy in the United States yesterday issued a statement declaring that rumors of the French government negotiating a peace treaty with Germany and Italy, or ceding French territory to Germany and Italy, are completely unfounded. Claims that the Axis powers will use French military bases, or that France will relinquish part of its sovereignty in mainland France or French territories, are also groundless. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Dublin: The French Legation here states that the French Minister has been instructed to deny reports that important French or French colonial bases have been placed under the control of Italy or Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: According to information received by Reuters from Stockholm and Zurich, Switzerland, the French fleet may be made available to the Axis powers. Reuters has received two important dispatches from Sweden and Switzerland regarding the Hitler-Laval talks. Although the sources are different, the reports largely agree, seemingly confirming the veracity of the conditions presented by Germany to France. The dispatch from Stockholm states that, according to reliable sources, Hitler presented Laval with the following conditions during the talks: (1) France will cede Alsace and Lorraine to Germany; (2) The Axis powers will use the air and naval bases in the unoccupied zone of France until the end of the war; (3) France will transfer its fleet to the Axis powers for their use; (4) France will cede Vietnam to Japan; (5) France will cede most of French Morocco to Spain; (6) Italy will receive Tunisia and a large part of Algeria, as well as other coastal lands; (7) French colonies will be placed under the joint control of Germany, Italy, and France, with this system to be reviewed when the war ends. Meanwhile, the dispatch from Zurich also states that, according to reliable sources, Hitler has presented France with the following conditions: (1) Morocco will be ceded to Spain; (2) Vietnam will be ceded to Japan; (3) Italy will take Tunisia and part of Algeria, as well as part of the Maritime Alps; (4) Germany takes Alsace-Lorraine and the area from Switzerland to the North Sea; (5) French air and naval bases will be made available to the Axis powers until the end of the war; (6) French colonies will be placed under joint control until the end of the war, at which point the control arrangements will be determined. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Zurich: According to observers here, Hitler urged Mussolini to curb Italian desires for French territory at their meeting in Florence. As a result, a Franco-German agreement was reached. Italy originally wanted to seize French Corsica, Savoy, and Tunisia. However, under the new agreement, France may retain Corsica and Savoy, and possibly even Nice. As for Tunisia, nothing has been heard. Italy may not have abandoned its original desire for Tunisia. It is widely believed that Italy may have proposed conditions to be met by taking claims in Greece. Other German concessions to France reportedly include: (1) France retaining Lorraine, but not Alsace; (2) The Vichy government returning to Paris; and (3) The border between the occupied and unoccupied zones moving north. In return, France will undertake economic and political cooperation under German leadership to establish a new European order aimed at defeating Britain. As for military cooperation, France may offer its naval bases along the Mediterranean coast and in French North Africa to the Axis powers. It is widely believed that the French colonial army will not fight against Britain unless attacked by British forces. However, French naval involvement in the war remains a possibility. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: As Italian forces continue their advance into Greece, reliable sources tell reporters that Head of State Hitler and Premier Mussolini have reached a consensus on the terms of a separate peace with France. It is also stated that the two leaders reached a final decision at their important meeting in Florence on Monday and intend to hold another direct Franco-German and Franco-Italian meeting before taking the final steps and signing the separate peace. Considering the Italian offensive against Greece, informed sources here believe that Italy will revise its demands on France and instead seek to seize a large part of the French fleet to be able to confront the British fleet in the Mediterranean. Political circles here believe that French Vice-Premier Laval will soon arrive in Italy to sign "a most important document." This document will include modifications to the armistice terms, allowing Italy to use French warships and naval and air bases. (International News Service dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Kennedy Broadcasts Speech Endorsing Roosevelt's Re-election; Urges Rapid Rearmament</h3>
<p>New York: Joseph P. Kennedy, the current U.S. Ambassador to Britain, broadcast a speech today in New York, vigorously endorsing President Roosevelt's re-election. He insisted that merely relying on the ocean as a barrier against reactionary forces threatening civilization is insufficient. If the United States can rapidly rearm, it can avoid being drawn into the war. From a British perspective, the most unfortunate step would be American participation, as all raw materials would inevitably remain in the United States and the strength of assistance to Britain would be greatly limited. He also denied that the United States has any secret commitments to Britain that could place the United States at war, as what Britain seeks from the United States is not manpower, but machinery. He concluded by urging voters to support President Roosevelt, an experienced leader, and reject his untested opponent. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>British Aid Promise Excites Greece Greatly: Greek Prime Minister Cables Churchill, Determined to Fight for Victory</h3>
<p>Athens: Greek Prime Minister Metaxas recently replied to British Prime Minister Churchill's telegram of the 1st, stating, "We have extreme faith in our great and courageous allies, and will, based on the principles of justice, righteousness, and freedom established three thousand years ago on the sacred land we are now defending, achieve a common victory. We will, with the same perseverance and determination, oppose the aggression of perfidious enemy nations and march forward to final victory." (Reuters, 30th)</p>

However, the Greek troops are enthusiastically responding to Prime Minister Metaxas's proclamation, which stated that Greece is not fighting alone, and the entire civilized world supports them. The spokesperson also said that Mr. Metaxas's hope that the three armies will give their all, reviving the achievements of 1921, will certainly not be in vain. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to London's "Daily Telegraph," the cooperation plan between the British and Greek general staffs can now be implemented.

Turkish Army Minister Ali Rıza Artunkal also declared to the press that the Turkish army would defend the homeland, honor, and rights of the Turkish nation when needed. The special express train from Istanbul to the southern capital on Monday was unable to pass through Greek territory due to Greece's refusal, but yesterday's train was allowed to pass.

(Haitong, 30th)</p>
<p>New York: The American conscription lottery began yesterday. President Roosevelt personally drew the number of the first New York area resident to be conscripted from a historically significant fishbowl. This first conscript was a Chinese American youth named Yuan Changzhang. When the youth learned that his name had been recorded in history, as reporters gathered at his doorstep, he was greatly surprised. He then answered the reporters simply, "I will certainly go."

<h3>Major Fire at U.S. Department of War: Rumors of Sabotage; Military Secrets Nearly Burned</h3>
<p>Washington: An outbuilding of the Department of War, where several coded telegrams were stored, caught fire accidentally on Tuesday. The building is currently guarded by troops, as some sources are saying the fire was caused by saboteurs. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington: A major fire broke out at the U.S. Department of War at 10:00 AM today, endangering military secrets and important codes. The majority of the Department of War's offices, including the Secretary of War's office, were threatened. The fire originated in an outbuilding of the War Department building, in which were located the offices of Secretary of War Stimson and most of the staff. Three rooms in the outbuilding and countless documents and files were destroyed. For a time after the fire broke out, it appeared that the entire War Department building would be consumed, and extremely important military secrets and codes would be burned. However, the fire was brought under control by the strenuous efforts of the fire brigades and all available fire-extinguishing equipment, and these important secrets and codes, as well as other important items, were preserved. Chief of Staff Marshall arrived thirty minutes after the fire broke out and said that the cause of the fire should be immediately investigated. It is widely believed that the fire originated near the code room, but the code room itself was not damaged. Countless passersby stopped to watch the firefighters as they battled the blaze, and more than thirty fire engines were dispatched to provide assistance. The firefighters used all their strength to control the fire. At 4:50 PM, Chief of Staff Marshall arrived and ordered 500 soldiers to assist in the firefighting efforts. (United Press, 30th)</p>

<h3>The French Concession Courts Remain Quiet and Stable: Trials Proceed as Usual, No Anomalies; All External Rumors Are Untrue</h3>
<p>Rumors that the High Court and the Second Special Court within the French Concession had been taken over have been investigated from multiple sources and found to be untrue. Yesterday, all civil and criminal divisions of both courts continued to hear cases as usual, with no changes. The so-called takeover news reportedly originated in a Western newspaper report, the details of which seemed quite sensational at first glance. However, according to those close to the courts, facts speak louder than words. Everything at the courts is proceeding as usual, and the normal acceptance of lawsuits is a visible fact. Those who lightly believe baseless rumors and think that an irresistible force is coming are simply too nervous.</p>
<p>French Consul General Expresses Cooperation</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the newly appointed French Consul General Magre has paid a visit to Yang Peng, President of the High Court, after arriving in Shanghai. While this was a courtesy visit that diplomatic officials make at the beginning of their tenure, it is said that Mr. Magre expressed that the Vichy government and the Chinese government have very close ties, and the French side will continue to sincerely cooperate with legitimate Chinese institutions within the French Concession. In light of this, the rumors that there is already a rift between the French Concession authorities and the courts are self-defeating and do not need to be refuted further.</p>
<p>Court Authorities Deny Everything</p>
<p>A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the High Court on Avenue Petain yesterday afternoon to inquire about the supposed takeover of the courts. The authorities solemnly denied this news, stating that these rumors likely originated about a week ago, when the new Japanese Consul General Kunei Kanshiro made an informal request to the French Concession authorities' legal advisor, Du Ge, to hand over the two courts in the French Concession. Du did not agree at the time but only said that he would relay this request to the new French Consul General Magre, who was about to arrive in Shanghai. When Consul General Magre arrived in Shanghai, he rejected this request and stated that the status quo must be maintained. Three or four days later, French Ambassador to China Cosme sent a telegram from Chongqing to the new Consul General Magre, stating that the issue of the courts must be absolutely maintained in its current state. However, outsiders did not understand the truth, and rumors spread. The truth is that nothing like that has happened. Furthermore, officials from the First Special Court stated that the reports in foreign newspapers were completely false. The reporter then inspected the court and the Second Special District Court for a week and found that both courts were operating as usual, with armored guard vehicles dispatched by the police to provide strict protection, and no other unusual circumstances were present.</p>
<h3>All Circles Prepare to Celebrate the Birthday of the Founding Father: Deadline for Donations for Winter Clothing Extended to the End of November</h3>
<p>The anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, on November 12th is approaching. Due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, various circles in Shanghai, in addition to various schools holding simple commemorative gatherings to elaborate on the Founding Father's revolutionary achievements, will not host any extravagant commemorative ceremonies. However, various agencies, public organizations, and schools will still take a holiday as usual to express their celebration. In order to emulate the Founding Father's revolutionary spirit, support national policies, and accelerate the completion of the great task of resistance and reconstruction, all circles, in addition to unanimously emphasizing spiritual encouragement and working hard in their respective positions, will also take advantage of the anniversary of the founding of the National Patriotic Construction Savings Movement Committee to intensify the promotion of the savings movement to promote national construction. In addition, the collection of 500,000 yuan for winter clothing in Shanghai, which began in August, has been very successful due to the enthusiastic participation of all circles. According to the regulations of the National Fundraising Association, the original deadline was today. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai and in order to achieve the goal of double presentation, the relevant parties have decided to extend the deadline for fundraising for winter clothing by one month, to November 30th. All circles, motivated by patriotic fervor, have decided to continue to donate enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>After the Outbreak of the Italian-Greek War, the Greek Consul States: The Whole Country Is United to Resist Aggression; We Will Certainly Be Able to Maintain the Glory of Athens</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited the Greek Consulate General at 9 Bund in the French Concession yesterday to inquire about the situation of the Italian-Greek war. According to Consul General Yu Ne Lates, he had only received a brief communiqué from his country stating that Italian troops had invaded his country, and he had nothing else to report. Although Mr. Yu's attitude was extremely silent, he was very optimistic about the war. He firmly believed that his countrymen would be united to resist foreign aggression in order to maintain the "glory of Athens." Since the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, Greeks and concerned parties in this port have flocked to the Consulate General to inquire about news, causing what was usually a quiet and peaceful place to suddenly appear more tense and busy.</p>
<h3>Zhou Zhenyan and Others in Pudong Lead Their Troops in Revolt: Since There Is Absolutely No Room for Survival by Compromise, Restoring the Han Territory Should Not Be the Responsibility of Others</h3>
<p>The various units of the so-called "Peacebuilding National Salvation Army" stationed in Pudong have recently been deployed by the Japanese to the front lines in Western Zhejiang to fight. It was stated that they would return to defense in ten days, but unexpectedly, a month has passed, and there has been no news, and there has been a second batch of deployment orders. The general "Peace Army" has suddenly shown signs of wavering. Furthermore, given that all of the weapons of the Qi Yu Yan unit have been confiscated and the Xu Hongfa unit is under surveillance, it is felt that the situation is precarious and unbearable. Therefore, they have revolted one after another. On the evening of the 25th of this month, Zhou Zhenting, the company commander of the Special Service Company of the Sixth Regiment of the "Peacebuilding National Salvation Army," Wang Yongquan, the company commander of the Seventh Company, Jin Fangchu, the company commander of the Eighth Company, Su Jinwen, the company commander of the Ninth Company, and Yang Jingyun, the company commander of the Tenth Company, led their five or six hundred men in a complete revolt. They have already established contact with the Central Government and have begun guerrilla warfare. It is said that the cadres of this unit are all sound and enthusiastic patriots, so they took the lead in launching the revolt. The telegram of revolt from Zhou Zhenting and others has been obtained and is transcribed below (titles abbreviated): Your Excellency, We, Zhenting and others, previously endured humiliation for a time because of the difficult circumstances and precarious situation, but we never ceased to encourage our subordinates and bide our time. Now, the Japanese forces are stretched thin and sinking deeper and deeper. They are deploying thousands of troops from Pudong to fight in Western Zhejiang, driving Chinese people to kill each other. Anyone with a conscience cannot bear to do this. We, Zhenting and others, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and know that there is absolutely no room for survival by compromise, and we will forever be sinners to the nation and the race. Therefore, we have personally led our troops in revolt and are now under the leadership of personnel sent by the Central Government, who have promised us a chance to start anew. We hope that all the armies accepted into the organization will be able to rise up and return together to restore the Han territory. May the task not be the responsibility of others. We send this telegram from afar, full of emotion. Zhou Zhenting, Wang Yongquan, Jin Fangchu, Su Jinwen, Yang Jingyun, and their subordinates respectfully send this message west.</p>
<h3>Estonian Consulate Documents Transferred to Soviet Representatives: Ministry of Justice Directs Courts to Comply</h3>
<p>Since Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as a member state in September of this year, all Estonian rights and interests in China are protected by the Soviet Union. Previously, personnel sent by the Soviet Embassy in Japan came to Shanghai to collect the Estonian Consulate's files but were unsuccessful. A petition was then filed with the court to seize them, which was carried out by the court on the 18th of this month, as reported in this newspaper on several occasions. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Justice of the National Government recently sent a telegram to the Second High Court, ordering it to hand over all documents of the Estonian Consulate to Soviet representatives for collection. Upon receiving the order, the court has notified the First Special Court to comply.</p>
<h3>Important Statement from the French Embassy: Denies Rumors of French-German Negotiations</h3>
<p>Shanghai (Havas): The French Embassy in China issued a statement here today stating: "Regarding the news carried in local newspapers about negotiations being conducted between France and Germany, its nature is invariably manipulative. This embassy wishes to reiterate the formal denial issued by responsible French authorities. All rumors concerning (1) the preliminary conclusion of peace between France and Germany, (2) the transfer of French territory, (3) the lending of French military bases to Germany or Italy, or (4) the exploitation of sovereignty in any part of mainland France or its territories are purely fabrications and have no basis."</p>
<h3>American Evacuation Transports Pre-booked Berths: Nearly 4,000 People; U.S. Government Does Not Subsidize Travel Expenses; American Organizations Plan Remediation</h3>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of American expatriates in China, the American government has already sent four ships east. The "President McKinley" and "Mariposa" have scheduled itineraries, arriving in Shanghai on the 2nd and 10th of next month respectively, as previously reported. Now, a third ship, the "Washington," has also been confirmed to arrive on the 17th of next month to transport American evacuees and depart for Manila on the 21st, arriving on the 23rd. It will depart directly from Manila to Los Angeles on the 25th, arriving around December 8th. As for</p>
<p>Although the price of tickets has been reduced, it is still not affordable for all American expatriates in China, as most American expatriates are employed in China and their salaries are calculated in legal tender, while tickets are sold in US dollars. The exchange rate between Chinese and American currencies differs greatly, so it is still necessary to reduce them further. The employment problem faced by American expatriates upon returning to the United States is also one of the difficulties, as they will have to seek new employment once they leave China. The above two points are difficulties in the evacuation, and although the American side in this port has appealed to Washington, requesting consideration of remedial measures, it is heard that the U.S. State Department has announced that the government does not have sufficient funds to subsidize. Although the American side feels slightly troubled, nearly 4,000 American expatriates in this port have applied to reserve berths, and there is no impact from the State Department's notice, as they have already found ways to purchase tickets. According to the authorities of the American President Lines, responding to the State Department's advice,</p>
<p>About 4,000 American expatriates are preparing to evacuate and return to the United States, and the situation has not changed due to Washington's announcement. However, the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of this port are considering this matter. The biggest difficulty lies in the exchange rate, as the income of the salaried class of American expatriates in this port is calculated in legal tender, while travel expenses to return to the United States require US dollars. The difference between the legal tender they have and the US dollars converted is quite large.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Police of the Public Concession to Be Inspected Tomorrow: At the Drill Hall of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>The Chinese and foreign police of the Public Concession will hold their annual inspection at 2:15 PM tomorrow at the Drill Hall of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps on Fuzhou Road. This year's inspection ceremony is of an informal nature, so members of the public will not be admitted except for Municipal Council members and journalists.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Vietnam Shipping Route Remains Important; Additional Vessels are Deployed; Ships Have Been Temporarily Chartered</h3>
<p>Despite the opening of the Burma Road and the diminishing importance of Vietnam to mainland China, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route remains significant due to Vietnam's rice and coal exports, which need to be sold in Shanghai, and Shanghai's manufactured goods, which Vietnam requires.</p>
<p>French Merchants Increase Shipments; Sailing Between Shanghai and Vietnam</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Haiphong, British merchant ships have abandoned the Shanghai-Vietnam route upon orders from the Ministry of the Navy. British ships from this port have been rerouted to Hong Kong, Roro, Singapore and other locations. French merchant ships have seized this opportunity, with French vessels sailing to Vietnam, including the already operating Kim Dinh and Rose. In addition to these, the French Postal Shipping Company has temporarily chartered ships to meet demand, sailing between Shanghai, Haiphong, and Saigon. Today, the freighter Song Thai has arrived in Shanghai, and the company's manager, Bengmingke, will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Both ships will sail from Vietnam to Shanghai, carrying tribute rice and Zhenzhu rice. After unloading, they will continue to sail to Vietnam. When the Shanghai-Haiphong route reopened last month, British merchant ships made two voyages per week. Currently, French merchant ships make a total of only five voyages per week, so there may be an increase in the future.</p>
<p>Dat De Nan Wheel; Sailing New Routes</p>
<p>The French Postal Shipping Company's Dat De Nan Wheel has been out of service in Saigon for a long time. The company has opened new routes in the Far East, as has been repeatedly recorded in the local newspaper. It is now known that the ship departed from Saigon, passed through Little Luzon, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, docking at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. There were also seventy or eighty passengers. The ship will depart from Shanghai for Kobe on the 4th of next month and return to Shanghai on the 11th or 12th of the month. After a one-day layover, it will go to Little Luzon and return to Saigon. Subsequently, the ship will depart from Saigon for Little Luzon, from Little Luzon to Shanghai to Japan, from Japan to Shanghai, from Shanghai to Little Luzon and return to Saigon, without calling at Hong Kong either way.</p>
<p>Hoping for Group Rice Purchases; To be Organized Automatically</p>
<p>It is learned that around the beginning of next month, about 150,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon will arrive in Shanghai. The transaction price of the rice is said to be 79 yuan per bag. At the same time, various rice merchants have taken advantage of the relaxed foreign exchange rate and the low price of foreign rice to entrust foreign firms to negotiate the transaction of a large quantity of tribute rice. Zhu Zixiang, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee, suggested to the committee yesterday that the source of foreign rice in the future is not without problems. At the same time, the price of rice in domestic rice-producing areas is different, and transportation is difficult. It seems that there is little certainty of transporting a large quantity of rice to Shanghai. Although there are rumors that the ban may be lifted, it is hoped that all sectors of society will actively participate in group rice purchases, or automatically initiate group rice purchases, so as not to rely on rice shops for the daily rice supply. The principle of evaluating foreign rice is to give a 5% legitimate profit. Although it has been approved by the authorities of the two concessions, the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday to negotiate at length. Everyone believed that the current market price of foreign rice in the rice market is about 5 yuan lower than the production price. If the principle of evaluating foreign rice is implemented on time, the market price will increase by more than 5 yuan per dan. Not only will it not be possible to lower the rice price, but it will also increase the market price, which is not a good policy in the end. Therefore, this principle will be implemented when the market price of foreign rice is high, so as to have some restrictions. The effect will be greater at that time. Therefore, the committee has started to investigate the production price of foreign rice and will immediately send a letter to the authorities of the two concessions for record. At the same time, it will be published in the newspapers so that all sectors of society will know about it. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, it continued to fall. It is said that this is purely due to the abundance of sources and the weakness of people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Church of Our Savior Holds All Saints' Day Evening Worship</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Church of Our Savior will hold its first All Saints' Day worship service at the new church on Zhao Zhujiao Road at 7:30 p.m. on November 1st, dedicated to commemorating the saints and believers who have passed away. The worship service that evening will be very solemn, dignified and unique, with special memorial texts. It is a rare ritual in the entire church at sea. Dr. Zhu Baoyuan, the pastor of the district, will give a speech, and more than 60 members of the male and female liturgical societies will assist with the latest anthems. Those who wish to see this worship service are welcome to visit the church at that time.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Agencies Return; Telegraph Service to be Restored Soon; Japanese Retreating Towards Keqiao Leaving Piles of Corpses; Zhejiang Province Collects 10 Million in Air Defense Funds</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops who infiltrated the urban area of Shaoxing, after being strongly attacked by the powerful Chinese troops, have broken through and retreated towards the Keqiao and Qianqing area. More than 200 Japanese troops from Zhoushan have been transferred elsewhere, and the Japanese troops in Dinghai are showing signs of retreating.</p>
<p>Recapture of the City</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who fled east from Gaishan Sanjiangkou crossed Keqiao from Lizhe on the 25th and infiltrated the suburbs of Shaodian City, causing fierce battles. The fierce battle lasted until the afternoon of the 26th, when a small group of more than 100 Japanese troops infiltrated the urban area and a street battle broke out. The garrison troops immediately moved to favorable terrain and began to besiege the urban area. The newly formed troops also arrived one after another. Starting at dawn on the 28th, the Chinese army launched a thunderous counterattack, repeatedly charging and killing. First, Donghu was recovered, and the attack continued towards Wuyunmen. The Japanese were exhausted and set fire to the south of the city to cover their retreat. The Chinese army bravely rushed into the city. The Japanese still stubbornly resisted in the streets. The fierce battle lasted until 4 p.m. The Japanese were unable to support themselves and broke through the Xiguo Gate in a group, retreating towards the Keqiao and Qianqing area. The Chinese army immediately recovered all the strongholds in the city and searched for the remaining Japanese, and sent teams to follow and pursue them to the west. The Japanese army was extremely embarrassed, abandoning military supplies and many corpses along the way.</p>
<p>Agencies Return</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Commissioner's Office, the County Government, the County Party Headquarters, the Police Bureau, and other agencies have returned to the city to work since the 29th. However, the city has been looted, and more than half of the houses have been burned down. Many refugees have been displaced and have no homes to return to, and urgently need relief and rehabilitation. The telegraph between Shanghai and Shaoxing has not been restored, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the American News Agency. This is because the telegraph equipment in the urban area of Shaoxing was removed from the urban area and has not been reinstalled. It can be restored in one or two days. When the people of Zhejiang in Shanghai heard this good news, they were all delighted and encouraged.</p>
<p>Air Defense Fund</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that Japanese aircraft have been rampant everywhere recently, and the people feel increasingly threatened. This is because defensive equipment and firefighting equipment, such as anti-aircraft guns and fire trucks, are not fully available for purchase. It has been found that the 20 million people in Zhejiang can raise a fund of 10 million yuan by donating 50 cents per person (those who cannot afford to pay will be paid by those who can afford to pay). This fund can be used to enrich air defense equipment, which can not only passively reduce losses, but also actively strike back. A detailed plan has been drafted. The Provincial Government believes that the air defense funds collected by various counties at present, such as protection equipment fees, membership fees, fines for violating air defense laws, and rent collected over the years, are not uniform in name, and there is no special person to manage them. It is difficult to audit and disburse. It has been decided to organize an Air Defense Fund Management Committee, which is directly subordinate to the Provincial Basic Protection Committee. All kinds of funds related to protection shall be managed and disbursed by the committee.</p>
<h3>Savings for National Construction; Expand the Publicity Week; Scheduled for One Week Starting November 10th; Savings Target Already Reached Three-Quarters</h3>
<p>The National Government sent a telegram to its subordinates, stating that the National Savings for National Construction Movement Committee has telegraphed that, in order to actively promote the savings movement, it plans to launch a nationwide expansion of the publicity week from November 10th to 16th. Please inform your subordinates to assist earnestly, etc. In addition to sending a telegram separately, this telegram is sent to you specially, hoping that you will assist earnestly and closely cooperate with the local Savings for National Construction Sub-Committee to facilitate the progress.</p>
<p>Subscription Amount</p>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau have stipulated the outline of promoting the business of savings for national construction. The total amount of savings for national construction to be increased by various banks and bureaus in the 29th year is set at 200 million yuan, which is divided into 150 million yuan for the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau, and 50 million yuan for the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The predetermined amount must be reached before the end of this year. It is specially approved to exempt the income tax on savings interest for national construction to encourage people to actively save. Yesterday, it was learned from the banking sector that the savings for national construction have already received more than 150 million yuan. Therefore, it is expected that the predetermined amount of 200 million yuan will be exceeded this year. Savings sub-committees have also been established in various overseas regions.</p>
<h3>A Visitor from Vietnam Talks; Japanese Army Cannot Invade Yunnan; Local French Oppose Humiliating Agreement; Japan Has Economic Ambitions in Vietnam</h3>
<p>After the government completely succumbed to Japan's demands, although French people in Vietnam are still governed by French people, and the French tricolor flag is still flying high, the streets are full of Japanese soldiers, and Japanese military aircraft are also soaring in the sky. Japan is now stationing troops in the Jing District of Vietnam and has taken over three airports to consolidate its position. At the same time, it is trying its best to win over the local people. More than half of the Japanese soldiers stationed in Haiphong and the airports are Japanese.</p>
<p>Despondent About Capitulation</p>
<p>French people in Vietnam are quite despondent about the humiliating agreement signed between the Vichy government and Japan, and they hold a pessimistic attitude of inevitable defeat. The hope of external assistance has already been abandoned. The battle of Lang Son was caused by internal strife between the French and Japanese sides. The agreement was signed at 3 p.m. on the 23rd of March, but at 10 p.m., a Japanese army suddenly acted on its own and attacked Lang Son, causing a battle that lasted three days. However, the orders issued by the French side were contradictory, resulting in increased resistance in only a few locations. Later, the Japanese army landed in Haiphong without encountering resistance.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the Status Quo; Sympathetic to the Resistance</p>
<p>Many French people in Vietnam are sympathetic to General Trigo Lan, who continues the resistance war, and are very dissatisfied with the current situation. However, their position does not allow them to unite to oppose the Vichy policy of the French authorities in Vietnam. There are fewer than 40,000 French and foreign residents in Vietnam, while the total population reaches 2 to 300 million. The natives are not concerned about the political situation.</p>
<p>Japan Hopes to Seize Resources</p>
<p>Japan also has economic ambitions in Vietnam and has sent an economic mission, which is expected to negotiate major wars with Vietnam. The demands made by Thailand were originally quite harsh, but they have now been revised. They hope to obtain the land they want without using force. It is expected that there will not be a serious war between Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Cut Off Roads to Consolidate Border Defenses</p>
<p>As far as China is concerned, it has cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and blown it up to consolidate border defenses. However, the Vietnamese army has no intention of invading, and only sends aircraft from its base in northern Vietnam to wreak havoc in China. Due to the terrain, it is very difficult for the Japanese army to invade China from Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Rice, Coal, and Firewood Dealers Raise Prices; French Authorities Impose Fines</h3>
<p>On October 30th, representatives from the Price Evaluation Committee, the Police Department, and the Health Department jointly inspected several rice shops, firewood shops, and coal shops in the French Concession. All merchants whose prices did not meet the price limits stipulated by the committee were fined.</p>
<h3>Damp Weather Leads to Flu Outbreak; Dense Fog This Morning</h3>
<p>After the cold snap, the weather in this port has gradually warmed up. This morning, there was a thin mist. The fog in the Huangpu River was dense, and ferries and transports were driving slowly with their lights on to avoid accidents. It did not dissipate until noon. However, due to the influence of the low pressure passing through Shanghai, the sky was overcast and rainy throughout the day, and the weather was very bad. The minimum temperature has risen to 54.3 degrees, and the weather is exceptionally humid, leading to a flu outbreak. There are still about 30 corpses found on the streets every day.</p>

<h3>Case of Xu Shuliang's Kidnapping; Two Masterminds Arrested; To Be Tried Together with the Remaining Bandits</h3>
<p>Xu Shuliang, the owner of the Shanghai Woolen Mill on Father Lao Road and a native of Ningbo, whose home is located at No. 77 Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, was suddenly kidnapped by several armed bandits at the door of his residence on the 18th of this month, who sent a letter demanding 200,000 yuan. Subsequently, Hua detectives Tang Jian, Yao Yuanlong, detectives Ni Jia Yan, and Zhu Chiqing of the Jing'an Police Station arrested five bandits including Li Ruitang at the Nanjing Hotel on Huagen Road, and rescued the hostage at No. 18 Fahua Town, along with Li Guangtai, who was watching the hostage. They were all taken to the First Special Court for interrogation and custody. During the investigation, detectives found that the case was actually conceived by Xu Chuanshi, a native of Ningbo who had previously worked in Xu's factory, in collusion with Yang Xiande, an employee of the Jinlong Woolen Mill at No. 24, Lane 207, Qipu Road. Xu and Yang were arrested and sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning, requesting to be detained and tried together in the case.</p>
<h3>Two Million Dollar Embezzlement Case; Still Under Investigation; Japanese Military Court to Investigate; Municipal Council Denies Such a Suggestion</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources, regarding the embezzlement of copper ingots worth two million yuan in the warehouse of the American Ruifeng Transport Company, the Japanese authorities suggested that the case be handed over to the Japanese military court to resolve the issue of privilege. It is said that Nelson, the legal advisor of Jardine Matheson, testified in court. It is heard that the Japanese military headquarters intends to submit documents to "prove" that the copper ingots are not owned by Jardine Matheson. However, senior officials of the Municipal Council denied yesterday that the Japanese side had made this suggestion to the Municipal Council and the Police Department. They pointed out that the Shanghai Municipal Police can only attend courts that are recognized as legal. Therefore, if the Police Department is to attend this court, the Municipal Council must consider this principle. At the same time, Swiss Consul Fontanel told reporters that he would never revoke Hurt's arrest warrant. According to Western detectives of the Police Department, Peng Te, an accomplice, is still under investigation. The First Special Court is scheduled to hear the case for the second time on November 7.</p>
<h3>Puyi Cemetery; Economic Burial Plots Established</h3>
<p>The ordinary cemetery was established by the Shanghai Pushan Villa many years ago. It has long been praised by Shanghai residents for its low fees. However, it was once suspended due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War. It has now been tidied up. In view of the fact that the colonies in Shanghai are temporary, and the cost of finding land for burial is very high, in order to adapt to the economic capabilities of general burial households, economic burial plots have been added, with A and B types of fees. Type A is 80 yuan, and Type B is 40 yuan, including the base, transportation costs, ash and soil burial costs. The procedures are simple and the handling is perfect. The cemetery is located on Zhen Da Road and Nan Da Road in Da Chang. The office is located in Pushan Villa on No. 6 Ma Road.</p>
<h3>Female Shanghai Opera Singer; Appeals Theft Charge; Yang Binghua Abandons Her; Ding Wan'e Dissatisfied with the Sentence</h3>
<p>Ding Wan'e, a female Shanghai opera singer (36 years old this year, living at No. 21 Xinshou'an Lane, Mintiniyin Road), has been living with Yang Binghua, a native of Hangzhou (37 years old, nicknamed "Little Yang"), since she divorced her husband Ding Shaolan. It has been eight years, and the relationship between the two parties is still harmonious. Unexpectedly, in the spring of this year, Ding discovered that her lover had another lover outside, which caused jealousy. Since then, there have been disputes in the family. Subsequently, the two parties published a notice in the newspaper to sever their cohabitation relationship. Recently, Yang accused Ding Wan'e of stealing his privately placed mahogany bed, dressing table, five-drawer cabinet, and wardrobe, under the pretext of entrusting the mahogany shop to repair them, and hiding them at No. 21 Lafayette Road. He repeatedly pursued Ding, who firmly denied it. Yang hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ding of theft. The first instance sentenced Ding Wan'e to 40 days of detention for theft, suspended for two years. After Ding was sentenced, she immediately declared her dissatisfaction in court. The plaintiff also believed that the sentence was too light to serve as a punishment. Therefore, both parties appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court at the same time. The case was heard yesterday by Presiding Judge Wu and Assessors Gu and Wu in a joint court. First, the defendant Ding Wan'e and her lawyer Jin Yu appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff Yang Binghua came from a background of cases and relied entirely on the defendant to maintain his life. The mahogany furniture was originally owned by herself, so there was no theft. Please approve the revocation of the original judgment and declare her not guilty. The plaintiff Yang Binghua also hired a lawyer to appear in court. The court reviewed the testimony and announced the end of the debate, scheduling another verdict on the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3>Goods Stored in Vietnam Return to Shanghai; Suddenly Stopped by Japanese Troops; Vietnamese Authorities Originally Approved Shipment; First Batch of Goods Forced to be Unloaded</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, Haiphong, Vietnam has become the main hub connecting inland China. Therefore, the shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong has suddenly flourished. However, due to the lack of vehicles to transport goods from Haiphong to the mainland, the goods piled up in Haiphong like mountains, no less than 20,000 tons. Unexpectedly, this summer, the Japanese army instigated the Vietnamese authorities to block the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway transportation, and the Japanese army landed in Haiphong, causing the transportation from Vietnam to the mainland to be interrupted. The goods stored in Haiphong could not be transported, and merchants suffered huge losses. Recently, it was planned to transport the goods stored in Vietnam back to Hong Kong and Shanghai in an attempt to reduce losses. Representatives were sent to Vietnam to negotiate, and approval was obtained from the Vietnamese authorities. Therefore, it was planned to start the shipment immediately. The first batch was said to be loaded on the Norwegian ship Essl, managed by the Zhongtong Shipping Company, to Lianhu. Unexpectedly, it was obstructed by the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam, and the goods that had been loaded on the ship were unloaded again. Merchants were extremely disappointed when they heard the news, believing that the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam was interfering in commercial transport, which was illegal. They are now continuing to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Shen Xuezhen; Almost Tricked Into Being Sold; Four Criminals Arrested Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Shen Xuezhen, a 17-year-old girl from Beiping who lives in East Fahua Town, was recently lured out of her home by Wan woman Zhang Xue, in collusion with her husband Zhang Qifa, and friends Dai Jinsheng from Zhenjiang and Zhang Baosheng from Changzhou. They planned to sell Shen to Qingdao to work as a prostitute. The case occurred on October 20, when Chinese and Western detectives from the Huisi Police Station arrested Zhang Xue and her husband Zhang Qifa, as well as Dai Zhang, at the Shanghai Ning Guild Hall on Kenenghai Road and No. 54 Lloyd Road. Together with Shen, they were all sent to the First Special District Court. Shen was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng opened the Third Criminal Court for review. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for the crime of abducting young girls for sale and profit, requesting strict investigation. According to Shen, the defendant Zhang Xue told me that a yarn factory in Caogao Town is recruiting female workers, who can get excellent wages. I was tricked by her. Unexpectedly, these people are not good people. They want to sell me to Qingdao and force me to work as a dancer. I don't want to. I quarreled with Zhang Xue at the Shanghai Ning Guild Hall, and police detectives came to rescue me. When questioned, the four defendants gave evasive answers. The court ordered them to be returned to custody separately, pending sentencing. Shen was led back by her mother, Shen Jin.</p>
<h3>South China Middle School Teacher; Extorts Money by Submitting Articles; Sentence Approved for Probation</h3>
<p>Luo Jiahua, a teacher at South China Middle School on Nanjing Road from Wuxi, and Xue Hequn, an accountant at Lihe Foreign Firm at No. 670 Sichuan Road from Suzhou, learned that Zhang Guoquan (home address No. 490 Lane 26 Lianyi Road, French Concession), the host of the Poor Children's Relief Association in Room 519 of the Puxi Building on Aiduya Road, used the name of the charity organization to solicit donations on various telegrams and broadcasts. The huge amount of donations received, only three-tenths of it was recorded in the account, and seven-tenths of it was embezzled and used to purchase private cars and prostitutes. Xue and Luo wrote an article about philanthropists and art, which was published in the local newspapers. Then, they cut and pasted the published article and sent it to Zhang Guoquan, asking him to set a date to subsidize the road expenses of 1,000 yuan for working in the mainland. After receiving the letter, Zhang had no choice but to invite Xue and Luo to wait for payment at the Meihua Wine Shop in Xieqiao Lane. Unexpectedly, the Chengdu Road Police Station learned about it and sent detectives to the Meihua Wine Shop to arrest Xue and Luo. They were prosecuted in the First Special Court for the crime of intimidation. The trial has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing sentenced Xue Hequn and Luo Jiahua to eight months of imprisonment each for jointly intimidating others to hand over property, with a three-year probation. The seized criminal evidence was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Stolen Car Discovered; Driver and Passerby Bound; Escape After Untying Themselves</h3>
<p>At 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Meihua Automobile Company's car (No. 17820) that was stolen by bandits was discovered near Danyang Road on Qitepu Road, Hongkou at 3 p.m. yesterday. A car from another automobile company passed by the area and recognized that the car belonged to Meihua. The company was notified by telephone, and the company reported to the police station and went to retrieve it. When the driver of the car, Zhang Baosheng, was driven off the car by the bandits, he was dragged to Hongzhen by two bandits, who tied Zhang Baosheng to a pole with a rope. When he was being tied up, a passerby passed by the area. Fearing that he would report them, the bandits dragged him to the electric pole and tied him to the electric pole with a rope, regardless of the situation. The two bandits then fled. After the sea person managed to untie himself, he went to the police station to report the case.</p>
<h3>College Student Begins and Abandons, Kneels and Apologizes, Assaults Mother-in-Law and Sister-in-Law, Sentenced to Fine, Divorce Lawsuit Parties Attempt Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Zhao Juzhang, a local resident of 287 Binlang Road in the Public Concession, 22 years old, a student at Guanghua University, allegedly fell in love last year with a female classmate, Wang Weizhen (also 22 years old this year, from Wuxi, 583 Xinbei Shansilu). Before it developed, they had a physical relationship. After several intimate encounters, Wang became pregnant. Wang's parents discovered the pregnancy and she</p>
<p>was repeatedly rebuked. Until January 17th of this year, Wang obtained her parents' consent and formally married Zhao Juzhang. After the marriage, the couple's feelings were still good, but the parents-in-law often used unbearable words to insult Wang, saying that Wang was pregnant before marriage, which was clearly improper. On February 22nd of the lunar calendar, Wang went to her maternal grandmother's house for entertainment. Late at night when she returned home, her parents-in-law refused to let her into the room. Wang, feeling expelled, returned to her mother's house. On the 27th, Zhao Juzhang rushed to Wang's house, claiming that he had also been</p>
<p>driven out by his parents and had nowhere to live. Wang discussed it with her parents, and they opened a room in her parents' home for them to live together. On the second day of the seventh lunar month, Zhao quarreled with his mother-in-law and kicked Wang out. That night, they stayed in a business hotel, and the room fee was paid by Wang pawning her watch. At that time, Wang was heavily pregnant, but Zhao suddenly ignored Wang's life. Wang left her mother's house for several days and went to the Sino-German Hospital to give birth, producing a child. Zhao did not pay for medical expenses, so Wang had no choice but to ask her parents to pay the medical expenses and take the mother and son</p>
<p>back to recuperate. After Wang brought the baby, the crystallization of their love, to her mother's house, Zhao still treated his wife as a stranger. Unexpectedly, on August 4th, Zhao quarreled with Wang because his request for over ten yuan in tuition was not granted. Wang's mother and sister, Weihua, came out to mediate, but Zhao actually invited his brother, Zhao Jianhong, and injured both his mother-in-law and sister-in-law, resulting in him being prosecuted in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhao Xingzhong were both sentenced to fines. Therefore, Wang, feeling that Zhao no longer had marital affection, recently hired lawyer Lin Tong to file a petition with the Civil Division of the First Special Court</p>
<p>seeking a divorce. Zhao, on the other hand, requested cohabitation and declared on the phone that if Wang insisted on a divorce, he would not agree unless he received 20,000 yuan. Regarding the divorce lawsuit, the court, according to the petition, summoned Zhao Juzhang to the Civil Division One court presided over by Judge Tao yesterday. The defendant, Zhao Juzhang, did not arrive, and the plaintiff, Wang Weizhen, also did not arrive, but their attorney, Zheng, arrived and stated that after the case occurred, the defendant had been accompanied by relatives and friends to the plaintiff's home a few days ago, lit candles, knelt and kowtowed to the plaintiff's mother to apologize. This case may be reconciled, and he requested an extension. The court approved the request.</p>

<h3>Thousand Cup Charity Basketball, To Be Held This Sunday Afternoon, Fang Li Battles Paramount, Battles Shanghai Stars, Tickets Will Be Pre-Sold Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The charity basketball competition initiated by the Daqian Boxing Club to commemorate its second anniversary has been progressing very smoothly since it started preparations. It has been decided to hold it at the former site of the Daqian World on Notre Dame Road this Sunday (3rd) afternoon. The Paramount, the Shanghai champion of the All-Shanghai League, and the newly emerging strong team, the Shanghai Star Team, have been invited to participate in the main battle. Since accepting the invitation, they have been working hard and preparing for the battle. The Shanghai Star Team has also telegraphed Cai Jingxiong, a national player far away in the south, to come to Shanghai to help. Mr. Cai has left Yunnan at the beginning of the month, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within one or two days. At that time, he may be able to catch up and participate in the battle. As for Paramount, there are also arrangements to strengthen the excitement of the competition. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Difficult Teachers College, in order to change the labor, has set a banquet for the players of both sides at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Sima Road at 7:00 tonight. However, the opposing team participating in the women's performance still needs to be decided tonight, so it has been decided to hold another strict banquet on the night of the grand meeting to comfort them. At that time, the sports news media will be invited to participate again to celebrate together. As for the tickets, in addition to the provision that ordinary tickets are uniformly priced at five yuan per ticket, which has been enthusiastically promoted by the backbone members of the Daqian Boxing Club to all parties, there are also ten special honorary seats, each priced at one hundred yuan, for the competition of major philanthropists. It is scheduled to start selling tomorrow, and the sales location will be disclosed in major newspapers tomorrow. However, the number of ordinary tickets is tentatively set at one thousand, and the current sales have exceeded the number of checkpoints. The number of tickets available for public sale tomorrow will inevitably be small, and those who want to buy must be quick to preempt the opportunity. As for all the preparations, the club has organized a committee to be responsible for handling them. The committee members are Gu Songling, Li Xiangxu, Li Shansheng, Liu Weilun, Shen Lantian, Xun Li, Pan Hongding, Cheng Zhiliang and other nine people, and Yuan Ludeng is invited to serve as the chairman of the conference.

<h3>Gold Market Wants to Fall But Stops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cooked gold market's view was that because the US dollar turned from loose to tight, the market first fell and then rose. The 5,500 yuan mark was decisively broken and then pulled back. The morning opened low at 5,495 yuan. It was difficult to sell and close at 6.9375 yuan for this month's US dollar, and the selling momentum was even more surging. Securities firms sold as low as 5,450 yuan, and there was more favorable air. Moreover, with the US dollar being absorbed by various Chinese and foreign banks and Sassoon, it softened to 6 yuan, and the market was agitated. Silver and gold shops were adding to their long positions, and the price rose to 5,550 yuan. The market closed at 5,535 yuan, continuing to rise by 15 yuan.

<p>Half-Day Fluctuation of 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The morning started with the exchange market reporting a rise, and buyers were not forthcoming. Silver shops first sold 10 taels to gold shops, opening at 5,495 yuan, which was already 25 yuan less than the previous day. Continuing, silver shops and securities firms dumped and fell to 5,450 yuan, but the foreign exchange turned stable, and people's hearts returned to high. Gold shops and other large households competed to buy, and the price immediately returned to a straight line. It is estimated that silver shops did 20 taels, at 5,530 yuan. Afterwards, it slightly fell by tens of yuan. It is estimated that silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops, at 5,480 yuan. Suddenly, buyers surged, and they were allowed to force the gold and silver shops to go long. Before long, the gold and silver shops entered the silver shops with 20 taels, rising to a high price of 5,550 yuan. As a result, the silver shops did another 10 taels, closing at 5,535 yuan, which was 15 yuan higher than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

<h3>Foreign Currency Market Outlook Is Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, only the cooked red market price first fell and then rose, British and American gold pounds rose slightly by 5 jiao, British gold notes were still rarely traded, and the market price was flat.

<h3>Securities: Good News Arrives, Domestic Bonds See Renewed Buying Interest, Foreign Stocks Also Show Good Potential</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for unified government bonds yesterday saw a sudden calming of the downward trend. This was due to favorable domestic news and frequent reports of victories. The outflow of spot goods from a certain major player decreased, and bullish forces gradually emerged. Buying interest was revived, and the market sentiment slowly improved as short covering occurred one after another. It is evident that although the supply and demand of various bonds on the surface were mixed, prices ultimately rebounded. At the opening this morning, the trend was firm with a hint of flatness because Hongda, Chengkang, and retail investors were dumping shares. Afterwards, the supply became scarce, and many buyers were interested, so Lemao, Shunchang, Tongkang, and others aggressively pushed up prices. The market price turned firm and rose by about half a yuan. Grade C bonds reappeared above 59 yuan. The afternoon saw a slight stabilization of fluctuations, and trading was also quieter. Sellers included Hongda, Tongshun, Chengkang, and Jiufu who successively sold off, while Shunchang, Tongkang, Maotai, and Lianyi were buying in. As a result of the day's price fluctuations, Grade D bonds, except for a small decrease of 5 jiao because there was no trading on the previous day, all rebounded by 3.5 to 7 jiao. The transaction volume was over 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Stock transactions included 22 shares of National Debt Bank, priced at 58.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market for various industries saw little transaction volume but good potential. Jardine Matheson rose after the previous day's correction and once showed signs of hitting a new high, but it was stopped by short sellers and those taking profits. Other stocks, such as British American Tobacco, Jardine, and Jardine Brewery, were very stable. Ziang Tai Timber Company's shares rose to 42 yuan at the closing. Rubber stocks were quiet.</p>
<p>London, November 29 (Tuesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British companies' stocks remain flat. The market has not changed.</p>
<h3>Wheelock and Others Pay Dividends</h3>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Price Breaks the 200 Yuan Mark, Falling More Than 30 Yuan in One Day</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, and the downward trend is gradually emerging. This is because sales to customers are sluggish, and at the same time, there are some rumors that are favorable to short sellers. As a result, the market is weak, and short selling is active. Currently, both the long and short sides of the yarn market have considerable strength. It has been rising for a long time, and perhaps there will be a period of consolidation, which is also unknown. It is found that 1,980 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The opening atmosphere of the spot yarn market this morning was still good. 20-count Shuangma brand was 1,232 yuan. Soon it rose to 1,232 yuan. Subsequently, due to the lengthening of foreign exchange and the lack of actual demand, it fell back to 1,220 yuan. However, short selling activities covered the positions, and it rose again to 1,255 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market was not good, and floating longs came to close out their positions. The market was loose, and the market price fell straight to 1,207 yuan. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 5,930 bales. The market price for 20-count Shuangma fell by 17 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow traders 5,700 (illegible character) Hong Kong 120</p>
<p>Wenzhou 20 Statistics 5,930</p>
<p>In the afternoon, cotton yarn and cloth continued to decline, and the downward trend was particularly strong. It is said that the exchange market fell, so short sellers were very active. 20-count Shuangma initially traded at 1,207 yuan, then broke through the 200 yuan mark to 1,195 yuan, and finally traded at 1,197 yuan. Someone wants to buy in, it is said.</p>
<h3>Batch of Brazilian Cotton Ordered</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly flat and tired. Because the yarn market has fallen back, the atmosphere is slightly relaxed, and a batch of Brazilian cotton has been ordered, so the factory's demand is not strong. The fellow traders' purchases are also stagnant, it is said.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton in New York's cotton market was slightly active (illegible character), and then, due to the firmness of stock prices on Wall Street and the covering of some short positions, the closing price was up two or three pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by one rupee.</p>
<p>The transaction of Shanghai's foreign cotton has been extremely quiet in recent days. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude because of the instability of exchange rates. However, due to the lack of inventory of raw cotton in the market, cotton prices will not fall. The current situation is only a temporary stagnation.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: People Like Cream Flavored Five Spice Beans, Broad Beans Have Good Luck, Soybeans Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Recently, cream-flavored five-spice beans have been quite popular, so the late-season broad beans have unexpectedly had good luck. The market atmosphere is firm and abnormal. In addition, the source is scarce, and the bottom is thin (about only seven or eight thousand bags of large and small green and white broad beans). The sales market has exports, and the local street is searching for them, so they are quite tight. Yesterday, 50 bags of Wujiang selected green broad beans were traded at a price of 26.5 yuan, 300 bags of ordinary goods were traded at 23 yuan, more than 350 bags of Nanxiang green broad beans were traded at 21.1 to 21.8 yuan, 100 plus bags of Chongming green broad beans were traded at 20.065 yuan, 200 bags of sand broad beans were traded at 24 to 24.5 yuan, more than 300 bags of Jiading white broad beans were traded at 24.6 yuan, and 400 bags of small-grain Wuhu white broad beans were traded at 22.3 yuan. Recently, the soybean market has been quite sluggish, sales are not smooth, and the source is continuous, so the declining trend still exists. Yesterday, only 240 bags of Tianjin beans were traded at 40 to 39.5 yuan, and 50 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at 34.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: 8,000 Tons of Rice Arrive, Corn Accounts for Over 5,000 Tons, General Rice Prices Are Still Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large batch of foreign rice was directly shipped from Saigon on the French vessel "Dada De Nam," as was previously announced in the newspaper. It is now learned that the ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, carrying 8,000 tons of foreign rice, including 5,067 tons of corn (i.e., pearl rice) and 2,324 tons of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It is also learned that the French company's cargo ship "Songtai" may also arrive today, bringing a large amount of foreign rice and corn from Saigon, totaling 9,000 tons. The exact amount of rice will be reported after the ship arrives. (From "Zu")</p>
<p>The supply of foreign rice has recently arrived in a continuous stream, and the inventory in the city has gradually increased. However, the sales, except for a slight embellishment by the local shops, have long been halted by the customer stockpiles. Even speculative floating buyers have stopped because there is no profit to be made in the declining market prices. The market is taking a natural trend and gradually declining. Foreign orders for the No. 2 Saigon shipment are only 71 yuan. However, due to the recent shortage of ship space, 500 tons negotiated by Duoyang Bank yesterday may have to be postponed. British American Tobacco's re-boxed goods were still being shouted at 71 yuan in the morning, but because the fixed price was low, 150 tons were sold off at 70.05 yuan. High-level stores took advantage of the low price in the early market decline, so the final decline was only 4 or 5 jiao. The transaction volume was 7 or 8 thousand bags.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 piculs of new japonica rice, sharp rice, and kiln-seed wild rice have arrived. Among them, there are only 60 or 70 piculs of kiln-seed rice. The goods were scarce and fragrant for a time, and the price was increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan in an instant. However, the supply and demand of new japonica and wild rice are similar, and only a stable situation is presented. The same is true for Du Sheep sharp rice. The opening prices were 75 yuan and 74.5 yuan for Qingjiao kiln-seed rice, 71.5 yuan to 70 yuan for Kunshan new japonica rice, 77 yuan to 73 yuan for original bags, 79 yuan to 77 yuan for Sijing wild rice, 66.5 yuan to 64 yuan per picul for Du sharp rice, 71 yuan for factory special, 66 yuan for Sheep sharp rice, and there was no change in broken rice. Changbang high-quality broken rice was sold for 85 yuan, and South Port early broken rice was sold for 78 yuan per original bag and 77 yuan to 70 yuan per picul. The route for glutinous rice wholesale is still sluggish, and there is a lot of foreign glutinous rice in the market. The owners all have the intention of selling off, so the domestic glutinous rice is fatigued and falls by 5 or 6 jiao to 1 yuan. Kaiyi Liyang white rice opened at 75 yuan, Changdan at 74.5 yuan to 73 yuan, and Hong Kong special rice fell from 72 yuan to 68 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Supply Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market did not escape the sluggish situation. Since the factory supply has increased recently, the local demand is quite abundant, and even ordinary foreign flour is being sold in the market, so the market has made little progress. The returned goods from the Old Military Barracks are only 18.78 yuan, and there is only a little activity in the local street. The people's hearts are also weak because foreign flour is expected to arrive soon, and the market, except for the Huachang factory selling 8 or 9 thousand bags in batches, has very little other trading. The market is still watching for softening.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market remained unchanged. The supply from inland China has been scarce for a long time, and the foreign supply is also quiet. In the recent fatigue of the flour market, it is difficult for the market to recover. The purchase prices of the factories are mostly limited to the original level, and there are few suppliers. Except for a few sporadic deliveries of nearby wheat to Japanese factories, there are no other formal transactions.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Futures Trading Accounts for Only a Small Number... Mostly Spot Payment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the factory cloth market was stable. In recent trades among the businesses, the majority are paid spot. Because only small amounts are future trades, when the month ends, there is little turbulence. The coarse cloths, colored cloths, and bleached cloths are mostly not sold in bulk. For smaller purchases of cloth, each piece will only be offered at discount of 2.5 jiao. The Zhejiang gang had more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill fabric. The Kuagang gang had more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth. The North Road Yantai gang had more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and twill flannelette. The local street had more than 400 pieces total. The Nanyang gang had more than 5,000 piece of colored and bleached fabric. On the 31st, 380 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The East cloth was caused by the exchange prices of yarn decreasing, and so the floating buyers were eager to sell. The best Longtou brands are 7.5 jiao cheaper, up to 36 yuan and 4.5 jiao. The closing prices for middle cloths and middle twills are only down 4 to 5 jiao. The actual demand in this market has not decreased. Fellow traders are still buying while it is cheap. Trading is still robust. The closing price for Sijunzi broadcloth is 1 yuan 1.35 jiao per yard.</p>
<h3>Coal: Dalian Coal Takes Advantage</h3>
<p>The market for fuel-wood and coal has been nearly completely stagnant since the Wenzhou coal supply was exhausted. Although rumors say the Dasheng vessel has entered the Ou River to seal the wrinkles, because this is the first voyage the fuel and rough good are hard to transport. But yesterday a foreign company was selling a Dalian grass-packed coal in the city for the price of 14 Japanese gold (converted to 21.01 legal tender), because the cost is high, trading is rare.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: China Tea Begins Buying Tea</h3>
<p>Since the management of red and green teas in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces was transferred to China Tea Company, it is said that the red and green teas in Tunxi have begun to be purchased since the 15th of this month. Qimen black tea's first batch of goods is priced at 330 yuan, the second batch is priced at 210 yuan, and the third batch is priced at 120 yuan. Tunxi Wuyuan Chouzhen is priced at 220 yuan, ordinary Zhenmei is priced at 160 yuan, and the prices of other goods are determined according to the grade, which is 15% higher than the current price compared to last year. General tea merchants are said to be satisfied with this. On the 31st, 342 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The association's prices for existing spot goods are 72 yuan for grade 24 coarse white sugar from the local warehouse, 71.7 yuan for sugar from external warehouses, and 57.5 yuan for transshipment, which was not traded. Taikoo's B mark white sugar is 70.5 yuan from the western warehouse and 70 yuan from the eastern warehouse. DY mark is 66.3 yuan from the western warehouse, HHX mark is 65.5 yuan from the eastern warehouse, and HM mark is 63.5 yuan from the western warehouse. Dutch red sugar was initially 54.2 yuan, then recovered to 54 yuan. Goods with the bill of lading dated November 18 were 54.5 yuan, up 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Dried Jujubes Rise More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the lack of new arrivals of dried jujubes and the gradual depletion of stocks in the market, prices have rebounded, increasing by more than ten yuan successively. The current market price for Jiaxing dried jujubes is 150 yuan, with the usual adjustments for top and bottom grades.</p>

<p>'Our ancestors tirelessly created it. But there were also those who tried to destroy it, namely some pages praising violence and eulogizing dictators.</p>
<p>'But we have ultimately progressed from barbarism to civilization!</p>
<p>'Just flip through it! Just imagine: this "Unfinished Masterpiece" has gone through the creation, arrangement, alteration, and obliteration of how many hands! How much effort of how many people has been consumed!</p>
<p>'Now is the time for us to create and arrange it. We have ready-made, excellent themes: "Struggles between groups! Group struggles against nature!"</p>
<p>'Some people, some groups, want to alter and obliterate it. Attack them! Overthrow them! This era no longer tolerates praise of violence and eulogies of dictators!</p>
<p>'If bloodshed is needed, let it flow, let it flow, to enrich and perfect this "Unfinished Masterpiece."</p>
<p>"Why, are you afraid? Please flip through it. Or write something with us. This is not just about 'leaving your name'!"</p>
<p>'We must strive to make it better before handing it over to our descendants, just as our ancestors handed it to us.'"</p>

<h3>Remembering My Eldest Brother</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>When my mind is blurred, the shadow of my eldest brother often appears before my eyes, still as haggard and humorous as before. The loud singing of "Graduation Song," which my eldest brother loved to sing, also spreads in my ears. This is because the impression my eldest brother gave me was too deep, so the shadow of my eldest brother is always engraved in my memory, never to be erased.</p>
<p>Brave, promising, and dear eldest brother, he actually broke the joy of family reunion, painfully left the person he most respected and was devoted to - our mother, separated from his most beloved younger brother and sister, and threw himself into the embrace of the motherland! This was something that happened on a dim moonlight night on September 3, 1939. To this day, I have not received good news from him from afar. I don't know where he is wandering now.</p>
<p>In my hometown, one early summer morning, the blood-red sun slowly rose from the eastern mountain, and everything on the earth showed vitality. The fish swam freely on the clear water surface. My eldest brother's thin hand rested on my shoulder. I carried two novels, took a bag of biscuits, and walked closely with my eldest brother. My second sister took three fishing rods, sang "Fisherman's Song," and followed behind us. We walked to the pond behind the house, put down the fishing rods, and sat on the Taihu stones under the shade of the tree. My eldest brother stroked the top of my head with his right hand, held my second sister's hand with his left hand, and said with an encouraging tone: "Second sister, younger brother Yun, your talents are much smarter than mine, and you have not suffered from the huge feudal invasion, because when you became sensible, the feudal ideas of the family had almost been overcome by me, so your thoughts are very pure. I want to help you embark on the right path so that you will become useful people in the future." This happened three years ago. Now, when I occasionally think about it, this scene is as if it were before my eyes.</p>
<p>Indeed, my eldest brother helped us with our academic achievements, introduced us to proper books, led us to live in groups, and participated in concerts and sports meets. At that time, there was not a moment in my heart that was not filled with innocent happiness. A naive smile appeared on my face.</p>
<p>When I parted with my eldest brother, he held my hand very earnestly and said, "I hope you will follow in my footsteps and embark on the bright road." My second sister is very ambitious. She really followed in my eldest brother's footsteps a week ago. All that remains is their lonely and pitiful younger brother - me. I don't know whether my eldest brother is alive or dead. I can't see his gaunt face, so I can only take his photo and cry loudly on the ground!</p>
<p>I don't know what year and month, my eldest brother's right hand will be able to stroke the top of my head again, and his left hand will hold my second sister's hand, sitting on the big Taihu stone under the tree.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 10: The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "What clothes was he wearing?" Old Mao said, "Of course, a suit." I thought to myself that the word "of course" was inevitably a bit suspicious. Zhao Boxiong was wearing Chinese clothing when he was arrested in the morning. However, after he was released, he might have changed into a suit.</p>
<p>I said to Hawthorne, "If it's him, that's even more troublesome. Do you think Chief Cui's guarantee is reliable?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne looked at Li Laotou on the ground and said slowly, "I don't want to rely on his guarantee. I want to catch this guy with my own hands. But the prerequisite is whether he did this thing, which remains to be studied." He pointed his finger at Li Zhiban on the ground. "The bullet is still in his chest, not penetrated - I don't think he will die, maybe he can still talk."</p>
<p>I replied, "If he can talk, that would be great. But that guy surnamed Zhao, in any case, it is necessary to find him. You said you want to catch him yourself, are you confident?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "I didn't have it before, but now it's different."</p>
<p>At this moment, with a burst of "bo-ba, bo-ba" sounds, the police station's ambulance had arrived. Ni Jinshou jumped down from the car. He first looked at Li Zhiban on the ground in panic, and then spoke to Hawthorne. "It's terrible! Another bloody case! What should I do?" "Hawthorne replied: "Don't panic. Now send him to the hospital first, maybe there is still a chance of rescue."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou waved to several people in white uniforms on the car. Two people carried the stretcher down as before and walked to Li Zhiban's side. In less than three minutes, the car had taken Li Zhiban to the hospital.</p>
<p>Hawthorne first waved to Old Mao to call him into the house, and then said to Jinshou, "According to Old Mao, when he heard the gunshot and ran out, he also saw Zhao Boxiong's back."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou exclaimed, "What! He did it again? This person has a certain , it's really unbearable."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "It's hard to say whether it was him. But we always need to see Mr. Zhao again."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou looked to the left and right of the street. "Where are Songquan and Hesheng? They should have seen it." (152)</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>Participate in Social Activities as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>We are not extremists who say that women must step into society only after the entire society is liberated, and abandon the possible, partial improvements at present; I believe that even mobilizing one or two women to participate in social activities is an aid to the entire women's liberation movement. Based on this principle, then Mrs. Chen Mingjun, who is "full of organizational skills," should do something for society as much as possible. "It is difficult to start making ropes with chaff," now that the iron gate for women to participate in social activities has been slightly opened, are you still standing still?</p>
<p>So my conclusion is this: young women who have studied in school or not, and are now waiting at home "to be matched," quickly run out of the family and go to society to do what you can do. Intellectual women who have servants at home should also do things outside the home as much as possible. This is not only to train yourselves, but also to open a path for your daughters!</p>
<h3>Suppose</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ken</p>
<p>Suppose life is acting in a play,</p>
<p>I will stand on the stage and shout for justice!</p>
<p>Suppose life is a floating cloud,</p>
<p>I will also condense into raindrops and fall to the earth!</p>

<h3>A Tourist's Account of Hollywood (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Sent by Cheng Zhizheng from Los Angeles</p>
<p>In order to tour the film capital renowned worldwide, the reporter made a special detour to the city of Los Angeles in southwestern America on his way home.</p>
<p>In most people's minds, Hollywood is imagined to be a large, decadent city, but in reality, it is just a small town near Los Angeles. One early autumn morning, after breakfast at the hotel, the reporter excitedly inquired about the route to Hollywood. It turned out that Hollywood was only about ten miles from Los Angeles, and could be reached directly by streetcar or bus. After a twenty-minute bus ride, the reporter saw several lush and beautiful mountain peaks in the distance, with a row of neon letters standing among the sparse trees. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be the large letters of "Hollywoodland."</p>
<p>If we interpret it literally, then Hollywood means "holly forest." It turns out that Hollywood's climate is spring-like all year round, somewhat like Singapore. The mountains are winding, and the trees are lush, making it a place of great scenic beauty. Calling it "holly forest" is perfectly fitting. The road from Los Angeles to Hollywood is lined with coconut trees, swaying in the breeze, adding endless poetic and picturesque charm.</p>
<p>Soon, our car arrived at Hollywood Boulevard, the center of Hollywood. As I strolled along the street, I seemed to feel a strange sensation, sensing that there might be a chance of discovering a few glittering stars in the bustling crowd. So, as I walked, I paid close attention to the endless stream of pedestrians. Although I didn't encounter any stars, I did see many beautiful women, probably starlets in the making.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Hollywood is self-evident. The sparkling jewels in the stores fully demonstrate the characteristics of this film capital! As the reporter walked along Hollywood Street for a while, he suddenly saw a "Chinese Theatre" (Grauman's Chinese). This is the most elaborate cinema in Hollywood, but it is not owned by Chinese people. I didn't inquire in detail why the word "Chinese" was used in the name. The architecture of the cinema is indeed Chinese in style, and the female ticket clerks each wear a set of Chinese-style silk clothing with the "double dragons playing with a pearl" design. The most interesting thing is that the cement in front of the cinema is imprinted with the footprints and handprints of many big stars. Each person signed their name below the prints and wrote a word or two, all to the owner of the theatre. John Barrymore, who has been married four times and is now going through a divorce, not only left his handprints and footprints but also personally imprinted the contours of his face. I took a close look, and some of the stars were no longer alive, and some of the old stars were no longer on the screen. The former included Douglas Fairbanks, and the latter included Gish. Shirley Temple recently retired, and her little hands and feet are particularly worthy of remembrance.</p>
<h3>On Ru Fulan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Weiwei</p>
<p>Speaking of Northern Wusheng (martial male roles), since Yang Xiaolou and Yu Zhenting passed away one after the other, and Shang Heyu retired due to old age, in today's terms, they can be divided into two generations. The older generation includes Zhou Ruian, Sun Yukun, and Ru Fulan, while the younger generation includes Li Wanchun, Wu Yanheng, Liu Zongyang, Yang Shengchun, Li Shengbin, Gao Shenglin, Wang Jinlu, and Chuan Dewei, among others. If we are to make an absolute judgment in terms of artistry, as it stands now, none of the younger generation can compare to the older generation. As for the three of the older generation, Zhou Ruian's acting is excessive, so he is inferior to Sun and Ru. Comparing Sun and Ru, each has their own strengths, and it is difficult to determine who is better. Recently, Ru Fulan was hired to come to Shanghai, and people both inside and outside the profession have praised him unanimously. His popularity is greater than that of all the Wusheng who have come here in the past, which shows that "it is appreciated by all." Therefore, I will analyze Fulan's art in detail.</p>
<p>Foundation: Ru Fulan is the grandson of Ru Laiqing and the son of Ru Xijiu. Laiqing studied at the Xiao Rongchun opera school and received the true teachings of Yang Rongshou. Rongshou was the foremost Wusheng of the last thirty years. Therefore, Fulan has a rich family heritage, different from the common. Fulan studied at the Fu Liancheng opera school, originally learning Xiaosheng (young male roles), and later changed to Wusheng. While at the school, he was personally taught by Xiao Changhua and Dong Fengnian. As a Xiaosheng, he was proficient in both civilian and military roles. After Cheng Lianxi left, Fulan and Lianxi became the leading Xiaosheng of Fu Liancheng, performing Xiaosheng operas such as "Qi Shuang Hui" (The Amazing Double Meeting), "Qun Ying Hui" (The Gathering of Heroes), and "Zhan Puyang" (The Battle of Puyang). He was already famous at the school. After changing to Wusheng, he started with the two operas "Jin Suo Zhen" (Golden Lock Array) and "Jin Lan Hui" (Golden Orchid Meeting). He then learned Yang (Rongshou)'s masterpieces such as "Tan Zhuang" (Exploring the Village), "Ye Ben" (Night Flight), "Wugong Ling" (Centipede Ridge), as well as "Zhuangyuan Yin" (The Scholar's Seal), "Tiao Hua Che" (Picking the Sliding Cart), and "Qilin Ge" (The Qilin Pavilion), all of which were taught by Laiqing. Therefore, although Fulan came from Fu Liancheng, what he gained from Fu Liancheng were Xiaosheng operas, and his Wusheng operas were all family-taught, which is to say, he indirectly followed the artistic lineage of Yang Rongshou.</p>
<p>Advantages: Today's general up-and-coming Wusheng do not have the same foundation as the older generation. This is not necessarily because things are getting worse, but the biggest reason is that today's teachers are no match for the old masters of the past. At the same time, also due to the influence of the times, today's opera schools are not as strict as they used to be, and the up-and-coming figures are having difficulty laying a good foundation precisely because they lack strict discipline.</p>
<p>Brief News (1) The Xinle Palace Yue Opera Theatre, located in the New Inn on Er Ma Lu (Second Avenue) and Daxin Street, has perfect internal facilities and comfortable seats. It is scheduled to open tonight, with star performers including Xiao Hehua, Ma Yiqin, Pang Tianhong, and Ye Xiangting, among others. (2) After the premiere of "Qin Huai Shijia" (The Families of Qin Huai River), viewers unanimously praised it. A single-volume edition is now available for fifty cents, and is sold by all newspaper vendors.</p>
