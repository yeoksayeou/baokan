<h3 id="c13">金融動盪析觀 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>邇來上海黑滙巿塲中之英美滙價動盪不定，趨向緊縮，尤以美滙為交易之中心，遠期破六元關而出入之，近遠期間差額甚大，直中前昨始稍形接近。金價亦高至五千四百元，買賣稱盛。來日之變化如何固不必加以預測，而市塲傳說之詞，則有可分析焉。</p>
<p>蓋為一般所最大關心者為法幣價値未來之變化如何，及其時局影響之深淺如何？關鍵似什於斯，其實不然；蓋幣値原極穩定，所不定者，投機者之謠諑與操縱而已。要知目前法幣對外滙之價値，不能維持之使高，高則害多而利少；况上海黑滙市塲之買賣，本無維持之可能，若略予維持則滙市可望短時期之小康，終必無效，抑日無益。故問題不在維持與否。謂予維持，亦僅係一種傳說而已。傳說之中，若所謂金庫券也，傳之為時已久，最先謠傳每法幣四元，易金庫券一元，每金庫券四元，兌美金一元，而今美金六元之匯價，固已相近於此數矣，然庫券仍未見發行。自前之幣制，似因時局而趨於凌亂，幣値遂由穩住而至於暴落；其實時局並非眞因，僅為破壞者與投機者利用時局而已。待時局澄淸，幣制總有整理之一日，至如何整理，如何澄淸，目前作為一種研究資料則可，若認為事實，則又將為人所利用，不免於治絲益棼，無當於事也。</p>
<p>若言統制，則外滙早已在統制之列，上海尙得自由買賣，原屬變態。若將市塲外滙收歸國有，此在平時，或許如臼銀集中之得成為事實；目前則情形特殊，難期獲效。有謂因時局將有新變化，貨幣方面，或將出現一種新形態，此又是神經過敏之談；蓋變態原來存在，若換湯不換藥，實不成其為新變化；不見華北之「聯鈔」華中之「華興鈔」乎？當其發行之始，莫小人心惶惶，以為可慮，而今如何，既難流通於游擊區中，又不能得國際間之承認。或曰，近日黃金之昂貴，即為此事之準備，詎知上海能有多少現金以供收集乎？即有所收集，量亦戔戔，祗堪作投機籌碼，若用以作發行準備，渺乎小矣！竊以為黃金昂貴，其最大原因，仍不脫拜金觀念；投機致富之輩，饒有餘資之老嫗少婦，以及內地來滬之土財主，各購黃金；亦有因憑藉時曾，掠奪榨取而得儻來之物，存儲恐遭意外之損失，運用又慮惹人之注意，因集中於黃金之購買，此則不僅以中國人民為然也。</p>
<p>外滙紫縮，原因更多，且有涉及於國外者。如前日紐約英滙需要减少。滙價又短，影響竟及於上海。而有美緊英鬆之現象。以言上海，雖報載對外貿易，頻告出超，而實際上因兌換計算單位之高低，此中所隱沒之數字甚鉅，若均照黑滙行市結算，入超之數，殆將高出於歷年之上。茲且小談統計，一觀事實，市塲使用之洋貨，未見有何緊縮，反因日人統制淪陷區內之物產並米糧粉麥棉花等尙須外求，平添外滙之漏巵。况今非出口季節，而洋貨源源進口，淸結滙款，勢須相當之頭寸。上海外滙之籌碼，能有幾何，若中央不為供給，則平昔所孳乳者必至有限，憑上海原有之籌碼，設無香港方面之接濟，滙價安有今日之局面？况與中國人爭取外滙者有日人，日人占用淪陷區之物產，向洋商換取外滙，此本應為中國所有，乃旁落於日人之手，近又加緊淪陷區內新絲繭之吸收，用心所在，亦無非為爭奪外滙耳。外滙之爭奪愈烈，滙市之變化愈多，此又未可視為幣値之本身問題者也。</p>
<p>處孤島之上，為富者計，無以投機為增加財富之工具，無以資金逃避為保全產業之捷徑，要知皮之不存，毛將焉傅；法幣如為逃避投機而斲傷過甚，富者實已自貶其富；此則祗須富者將其直接間接之財富統盤籌算，即可恍然。至於一般生活，若猶不知節用惜物，則外滙之消耗既多，物價之上漲愈甚、生活之困難亦必愈深。蓋國難臨頭，不　為　人應節約以勉力生存，亦應蓄積財力，為異日之用；奈何揚湯止沸，推波助瀾，消耗於每不自覺中！金融市塲之所以杌隍，一般人不自檢點其生活耗費，雖視為主因，亦無不可。</p>

<p>倫敦　「泰晤士報」外交訪員頃評述昨日之英法最高軍事會議云、目前法蘇兩國對於召回蘇聯大使事件、雖皆不欲擴大、惟雙方關係之緊張則可無疑、恊約國對於蘇聯之瞻望並無參商、蘇聯政策在去年八月間背棄英法、佔領波羅的海各島嶼海港、及無故進攻芬蘭後、已更見明顯、聞法國各閣員對德國經由西伯利亞輸入貨物事最感憂慮、並認為對於蘇聯船隻之運輸礦物、亟須加以最嚴密之防止、在彼等目光中、英方之扣留蘇輪兩艘事、殊有最大之重要意義云、（廿九日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、英法兩國即當採取各種措置、加緊實施對鎖政策、並將向各中立國尤其是向斯堪的那維亞半島及巴爾幹半島各國提出交涉、關於蘇聯問題、雖不致出以　動聽聞之舉動、但封鎖辦法或將擴大至於黑海、或與他國成立協定、以限制蘇聯之活動、亦自有其可能、要而言之、英法兩對於蘇聯保持和平態度、惟蘇聯輪船「塞林加」號「瑪柯夫斯基」號兩艘在若干時前、被英國軍艦截獲之後、英國政府不擬予以放行、且不間短期內仍有發生之可能云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c50">從各方面觀察　義國無力參戰　墨索里尼垂垂老矣 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>歐洲方面近來盛傅，春季將有大戰，屆時騎牆的義國也要有所舉動。義國在歐戰爆發以來却是一個時局之謎，或者說不過是一隻紙老虎。據美國報紙雜誌的紀載，義國實在沒有參戰的能力，茲分析如次。</p>
<p>先從義國的最高當局說起。美國的American　Mercury雜誌有道樣一段報道。據說，不久以前，一位老友應約到威尼斯宮去見墨索里尼。墨索里尼向來是遵守時間的，當時因為遲到了幾分鐘，奔趕上樓，喘着氣說，「一定是老了。」他立刻又覺失言，蹩着額，急忙轉換口氣說，「我最恨年老，思想糊塗，動作遲鈍，我寗死不願老。」他現年五十七歲，外表上並沒有多大改變，但是面上　皺紋却是深重了。從前，他對任何人都不相信，蓋無巨細，必定親自主持，發出命令，必定把執行的步　，詳詳細細的規定着。有一次，他曾以義國唯，勝任的人自詡，但是近來不對了，他逐漸把職灌移交齊亞諾，格蘭　，巴爾布　大員了。現在義國各方面都　漫起來了。各軍牆領多信巴爾韓　　是無可避免的，但却埋怨着本國軍隊接濟困難。羅馬觀察家只為　棄里尼正在待機　動，但是墨索里尼左右不作如是觀　多謂　業老了！　沒有　　　局的魄　了！</p>
<p>在纔　方面，義國也有不能參戰的苦痛。據紐約Heraid-Tribune駐羅馬訪員電稱，歐洲兩陸交通旣受着戰爭的打擊，　加上北歐的嚴寒，煤斤運來義國，完全停頓，該國燃料殆有告荒之虞。義國當局所謂準備應付一切的誇言，已不攻自破。據義國北部工業區報告，各工廠儲藏燃料原來不甚充分，現在殆已用罄，有幾處僅够支持一星期。義國的鐵路雖已進行大規模的電力化，但因缺煤而停開的火車，有一百三十列車。這種情形完全由於政府當局「得過且過，」竭力節省外滙一種政策所促成。即此一端，可見畢案里尼屢次宣稱的經濟自給自足政策，不過是徒托空言。</p>
<p>查義國所用的煤，向來大部份是德國，比利時，波蘭等國所供給。主要的運輸綫有兩條。一條是從德國的漢堡由海　到義國的熱諾亞。還有一條是由萊茵河多瑙河到奧地利，然後改由鐵路到義國，義國當局已在這方面預備着貨車六千　，轉供運煤之用。但是海路已給英國封鎖了，義國一部份的煤，因須靠英國供給。</p>
<p>外間雖盛傅，今年春天恐有「某種事變發作」。但是我們細心研究這種燃料接濟和儲藏的匱乏情况，就可揣摩着義國外强中乾的窘境。外間又傅義國各學校將自耶穌復活節假期起，無定期休假，俾於必要時，將各學校，改作醫院之用。但據觀察家意見，義國對於雙方交戰國，都須依靠其供給原料，謂欲向之作戰，簡直是不可思議。國內儲藏空虛，空言備戰，實不足聳人聽聞。所謂春天有事」一說，如果有何意義，或許是對付無力控制義國原料來源的蘇聯罷。</p>
<p>再就地中海及菲洲殖民地方面調兵的情形而觀，英法兩國似乎並不以義大利為其未來的敵國看待。據最可靠的估計，法國在敘利里集中的兵力約在二十五萬人左右，其中從法國的流動部隊調到的約有十萬人，從北菲洲法國各屬地調到的約有十一萬五千人，敘利亞原有駐軍及從馬達加斯加和越南調到的共約四萬人。法國的軍隊這樣的集中，北菲洲的戍軍勢必减少至最低限度，而義國在里比亞屬地的戍軍二十萬人並未有何减少的消息。</p>
<p>同時，英國的地中海艦隊治已全部調到大西洋。在這巴爾幹和近東的所謂「新陣綫」問題趨緊張的時候，英法難道不怕義國的海軍截斷地中海交通。英法海陸軍當局雖以為義國實力微薄，不足介意，但是保有潛艇一百艘飛機一千八百架的國家，在西西里與都尼斯間狹促的水道，仍是一種不可厚侮的實力。義國在巴爾幹方面政治勢力甚為活躍，也不可漠視。英法如果以埃及和敘利亞為根據地攻蘇聯的高加索，或假道土耳其，出兵巴爾幹，處於敵對地位的義國匪特有力量在埃及和里比亞邊境，從事牽制行動，而且可以從阿比西尼亞進窺英埃蘇丹或英屬東菲洲。</p>
<p>這種危險，英法軍事當局自然見得到，但是仍舊如無其事的在地中海方面進行其海陸軍的調動，個中意義，殊堪尋味。</p>

<p>紗市由疲轉強、雖美滙又見放長、而黃金稍挫、然人心反見良好、此因華南潮汕粵等處對於華紗需要旺盛、因之雙馬紗根子愈形緊迫、但同業大都心理因其底盤巳臻高境、所以不願買進、而賣出心思頗濃、故市盤升降範圍浩大、多空兩方競爭劇烈也、二十支雙馬開盤　為一千〇十六元、旋後直漲至一千〇三十七元、</p>

<h3 id="c117">進化的種子 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>個人生活的意義與價値，完全基於對思想的認識的程度。思想的作用，在心理學上是居於一切意識作用的最高級，是一種有系統的正確的觀念的聯合。人類有最完全的神經系，因此能超越於一般高等動物。為了要達到永續生存和不斷發展的目的，就不能不利用思想來控制自然與社會的環境了</p>
<p>我們為求增進生活意義和解決日常生活上所發生的許多疑難，便得籍訓練思想，以達到目的，誠如商戴克敎授所說「人類物質文化的創造，科學硏究的進步，全靠思想活動」。人類以外的任何生物，都受自然環境的支配以維持生存，人類獨能支配自然以改善社會環境，獲取一切生活資料，這不都是因為人類有思想作用嗎？</p>
<p>所以人類要按制社會環境，創造高度的精神文化達到生存進化的目的，必得靠我們思想的發達。人類生活的進化與否，都可以由思想的進步與衰落看出；促進人類思想的發達，仍須視研究自然和支配自然的能力如何定，近世紀四百餘年來歐洲的思想特別發達，所以科學也才有驚人的進步。如果不是哥白尼（Coperuicus）加理略（Galieo大聲疾呼倡導思想的方法，能够有這樣的成績嗎？人類文化的發展和生活的改進，有賴思想的進步；思想的進步有賴科學知識的發達，當然是無可置疑的了。</p>
<p>思想起於懷疑，懷疑起於生活上的疑難。我們做任何事在一帆風順時，不會發生什麼思想；反之，到了我們處理生活的方法，不能適應實際的情境時，亦即是疑難不決時，思想便產生了。疑難是產生思想的唯一條件，人類物質環境的進步，完全要我們對於生活的滿足與否。我們對於自己環境要不時研究控制和改進的方法，應該多多尋找生活上的問題，給予適當的解決，以訓練正確的思想。科學家的思想為什麽特別發達？沒有別的原因，只由於他們能够注意旁人所不注意的事，能够時常發生懷疑和尋找問題。牛頓注意到蘋果墜地，因發明　地心吸力，加理略擺動器的發明，由於他注意到禮拜堂裏擺動的燈，見可疑不疑，遇困難趨避，是永遠不會產生思想推進文化和啟迪人類的智能的。</p>
<p>我們要希望生活理想的提高，只有時時打破思想的惰性。對於生活的態度，應該認眞，遇了疑難，須設法求得適當的解決，並要留意日常生活中的微渺的地方，把握住觸發思想的機會，——這裏面孕育着人類進化的種子！</p>

<h3 id="c120">職業圈的另一面 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 劬影</p>
<p>讀了瑩金君的「職業圈裏」，引起無限感慨。處於堅苦建國的今日，成千萬的靑年為着經濟問題，一羣羣地走進那所謂「職業圈」，懷着滿腔的熱情和希望，換得的却是虛偽和勢利。孤島上正有千萬的靑年彷徨不安呢！他們的純潔熱烈的心靈，那裏經得起這種非法的摧殘？</p>
<p>自從我的老家被特殊的勢力所佔有，我流浪在孤島巳經三個年頭了。好容易得到了一個職業。　捧着金飯碗一樣，做事是絕不苟且的。一個月後，我開始體念到職業之難不在業務，在對人。</p>
<p>多數的商行裏，內部職員是有派別的。他們自認屬於某一系。其中似乎也有嚴密的組織，唯一的責任是攻訐他系；無事生非，鑽進上司——俗稱鑽狗洞。他們隱惡揚善（？）的功夫確是値得欽佩，總是面團團地，當着人面不會有半句閒曾的。我踏進那邊不久，就有一個某系的交際員拉我入系，為着不明瞭內部的情形，經我堅決地拒絕。</p>
<p>於是無情的命運殺奔來了！</p>
<p>一星期後，我被經理請（？）入嚴肅的法庭，他指示我凡事必須討敎先進，尤其是交際員某君是最最幹練不過的，最後還說：「你尙在試用時期呢。」我只得唯唯。</p>
<p>在歸途中，自思在職務上並無錯失，遭遇的却如此困難。為着家庭的負祖，我不能毅然辭職。我開始籌謀應付的方法了。</p>
<p>改變了方針，在休息時間時常和他們談談閒事。為着自尊心的關係，當然不涉於諂辭。不久，他們對我的歧視漸漸减少了。</p>
<p>當我環顧那虎狼似的尖銳的眼睛時，總是報以誠懇的微笑。他們所囑咐我的總是很快的完成。也許他們被感動了吧！笑臉中所藏的大刀似巳縮短了不少。</p>
<p>至於他們的誣論本是以攻訐為能事的。我立定了自己的脚跟，對於職務一些也不苟且，終於使他們無所施技。現在他們巳不再對我攻訐了——另一個同事吿訴我。雖然我沒有加入他們的集團，但是，一切總在忍耐中生活。不久，經理又招我進辦公室，勉我多多努力，似乎我還做得不差。</p>
<p>回想自己的遭遇，雖覺寒心，但是幸福的環境中往往有黑暗的前途；反之。黑暗的生活中何嘗沒有曙光呢？</p>
<p>靑年的朋友們，努力吧！</p>

<p>耶穌向天父祈求的話，所包括的人很多；當塲譏笑他的人，羅馬官長，羅馬兵丁，猶太祭司，等都包括在內，「父阿，饒恕他們」。這但表示了他對上帝的信任心，對仇人的愛心，並且暗示了世人與上帝的親子關係。小孩子要從父親得着什麽的時候，也是這樣再三呼叫着，「父阿，父阿，」耶穌為罪人求慈悲，求饒恕，不希奇嗎？上帝在西乃山上，前有　，後有雹，為他護擁，山崩地裂，多麼偉大，多麽莊嚴。但在各各他十字架上，受傷，口喝，臨死時，還大聲呼求着說，一父阿，饒恕他們，因為他們所做的，他們不知道。」足微有權能的宗敎雖則偉大，但有愛心的宗敎却更偉大，公正的宗敎雖則偉大，但為人求慈悲的宗敎却更偉大。傳說有一個兵士，犯罪，將被解到長官面前受審，他是常常犯罪的人，也常常受過刑罰。官長一提到他的名字便說，「這人又犯罪了嗎？什麽自新的路，都給他走了。」當時有一位下級官員進前說，「　吿上司，只是　有一件事未曾給他做到。」「什麽事？」「從不曾被饒恕過。」官長聽了覺得有點希奇，說，「恕嗎？」「他想了一想，命人把犯人帶進來，問他有何巾辨？」兵士答道：「沒有，我只為自己所行的　得痛心巳。」此時，他面上有表情，好像犯罪除受重刑外，無他希望。官望長着他大發慈悲之心，說，「好，我們給了你各種自新之路，現在　饒恕你一次，以觀後效。」兵士聽了，眞感動得熱淚直流　據說從那日起，他即做了新人，並且在社會上做了體面人，不再穿兵士服裝。所以，我說有權能的宗敎雖則偉大，但有愛心的宗敎，却更偉大。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3 id="c123">超特的藝人　華德狄斯耐 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 華基</p>
<p>華　德狄斯耐自從「白雲公主」一片獲得偉大成功之後，依舊精益求精的苦幹，最近的作品為「木偶奇遇記」此片早已到滬，關於它的內容，本　已有過文字介紹。現在來談些這位大藝人平日待人接物的情形吧。</p>
<p>百餘助手</p>
<p>在華德狄斯耐指導之下，還有五個導演，三十一個助手，五十六個副助手，更有三十二位注明畫家專畫人物·動作·表情，和二十六位畫家，專畫背景，尚有二十一位效果助理員，…統計他的助手不下一百餘位之多；而且都是美國數一數二的漫畫家，藝術家…至於他之所以能獲得道許多人很情願的替他工作，原因有四：</p>
<p>體諒同人</p>
<p>第一個原因，當然是他肯給人以很高興的酬報，這一些只要資本大，人人都能辦。</p>
<p>第二：狄斯耐是一個很體諒同人的人，若如有人因為有些頭痛，疾病而礙於工作的時候，他總是請他回去休養。雖然在表面上，因為少一個人的工作，不免要有損失，但是他深知在勉強工作出來的成績，總是不行的。</p>
<p>不恥下問</p>
<p>第三：他有「不恥下問」的美德，雖然他是世界最著名的卡通畫家，但決沒有驕傲的惡習。有一次他看見有個人拿了他的原稿在搖頭，他很誠意地要求他批評，那人壯着膽指出了他的錯誤，狄斯耐立刻笑顏逐開地接受了他的意見，並且很鄭重地請了一次客。</p>
<p>真實本領</p>
<p>第四：他的確有真實的本領。有一天，華氏的雇員中有一個人走進了他的辦公室，見到狄斯耐正在埋頭工作，他一見之下，使他佩服到五體投地，因為狄斯耐在很短的時間已完成了十六幅畫，這如果叫他來做，却非一天不行呢！因此他的雇員，個個都佩服他，　重他，竭誠的與他合作。像這樣的藝人，自然值得我們模仿了。</p>

<p>— 兆女</p>
<p>清　高宗（乾隆）好大喜功，用兵四方，旣平準部，復命征西大將軍兆惠往征回疆。回疆之統治者　布那敦與霍集占昆仲，霍有妻名香妃，美而賢，身有異香，故以之名焉。時　兵　薄回境，香妃方獵婦，市民　道　拜，爭問國事，妃言或將不免一戰，市民聞之，意氣激昂，咸願効死。一賣瓜老人，雖老益壯，談詞尤烈；獨巴達克酋長，冷然作厭戰之論，巴素涎妃美，盡別具用心也。</p>
<p>初，清師征回，曾遭敗北，一日忽遣使言和，布那敦不能，決召霍及各酋長同　，霍方受香妃之囑，以言和不　屈服，即席陳詞，慷慨主戰，巴達克力持異議，霍痛斥之，清使復出言不　，　霍戮死，戰事遂不可免。</p>
<p>清師因得巴達克輸　，征回軍勢如破竹，當霍出戰之前夕，妃歌舞為別，　料清出奇兵夜襲，霍等倉惶應戰，巴早　弩　待，霍遂陣亡。巴乃入宮見妃，誑言　媾和，惟須妃入京為質，否則當屠城，妃從之</p>
<p>高宗之所以征回也，香妃實為原因之一，及聞清使凱旋，並　得妃大喜，乃往西苑訪妃，乍見天人，不覺心醉神迷，佞臣和坤先意承旨，遊說香妃，妃　斯大悟，乃痛斥之，帝赧然而退，惟愛妃之情愈長矣</p>
<p>妃自入北京，無一時不以故鄉為懷，和坤乃請准於帝，在西苑築回城一座，以慰妃心。妃覩城固大悅，急下樓，面城內回民猶向妃羅拜如前。妃幾疑置身夢中矣，乃殷殷垂詢祖國情況，民皆誑詞以對，獨彼賣瓜老人，直　責妃變節，妃乃廢然復返，而高宗匿身帷後，出而向妃逼脅，妃大怒，拔刃相向，帝卒不得逞。</p>
<p>皇后聞帝納回妃，大妒，絮聒於太后之前，力陳此女之不可留。時太后亦聞妃美，乃召妃，妃至，太后詢得其情，亦深敬愛，乃勸帝遣之返，帝堅不尤，妃大怒，痛斥高宗，復出刃向帝刺去，帝急避，妃追之不及，斯時宮中大亂，而妃卒為武士所擒焉。</p>
<p>太后乃喟然嘆曰：「此女誓死不辱，不如成全其節烈，」遂命取白綾賜死，妃　死大喜，緩步登繯首之台，帝亦不禁揮淚涕泣，而惋惜不已也。</p>

<p>— 小田</p>
<p>一篇夫婦之道　大可給你參攷</p>
<p>閒　　太　了，現在應當講到路柳牆花的範圍和發生的原因了，路柳牆花不過是比喻　以任人攀折的意思，書寓不必說，講到游藝界裏的人物，舞女幾乎是十居其九，彈詞說書擹簧雜技之流，也幾乎要過半數，在本埠新聞裏，時常可以看到，可是多數是受着班主或同行的欺紿，大概是近水樓台的緣故，坤伶影星和話劇家，似乎比較好些，然而也說不上絕無僅有，總之，不論他把色身來引誘別人，或被別人引誘了色身，祗要有不正當的結合，不在藝術範圍內的舉動，都得算上，本來　柳墻花並不是一個什麽壞名詞，家花，野花，不過有一種區別罷了。</p>
<p>講到男女平等的哩論上，路柳牆花根本是不應當有的，不過中外幾千年來，這問題却不斷的連續發生着，我們不能不推想其發生的原因了，照交易論的原則講，總須一方願賣，一方願買，代價却不一定是金錢，纔能成交。男女的結合，當然也須兩相情願，照常理說，兩相情願，就訂婚結婚好了，何必要苟合呢？要說是結婚之後，忽然雙方都覺得不合式，就該離婚別求配偶，纔是正理。照這樣說，路柳牆花之所以為路柳牆花之所以為路柳牆花，也可說是女子自己願意的，他所以願意的原因，不是為生計所迫，就是工作的代價，　不及犧牲色相來得高，再不然，就是覺得犧牲色相來得寫意，工作來的勞苦，最可憐的如若不犧牲色相，工作就要受到壓迫，沒有希望成功。我們要消滅以上種種，祗有提高女子教育程度和工作效率。但這僅屬於賣的方面，若是祗有賣的，沒有買的，路柳牆花也根本沒法存在。未婚的男子，何以不去尋求他真正的配偶？已婚的丈夫，何以家中有了妻子，還要出外尋花問柳？治標的辦法，就是要有合理快樂的家庭，使他覺得在外面耗精費錢的不上算。根本的辦法，還是要提高女子的教育程度和工作效率。要曉得，分去男子的工作，即是分去男子報酬，分去男子的義務，即是分去男子的權利。在天秤上雙方的分量相　時，那方抽去分量，就向那方傾側，那方就要吃虧。諺　得隴望蜀，如果得蜀就要失隴，我想人們也不敢望蜀了。</p>

<h3 id="e12">Central Government Held Memorial Service for Revolutionary Martyrs Yesterday; Chairman Lin Reports: Foundation for Victory in the War of Resistance Has Been Laid; Potential of Great Nation Has Been Proven; Urges National Soldiers to Maintain Their Stand, Follow in the Blood-Stained Footsteps of the Martyrs and Redouble Their Efforts <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The central government held a memorial service for revolutionary martyrs this morning, presided over by Chairman Lin, who reported that today is the anniversary of revolutionary martyrs. It was in the year before the founding of the Republic of China, specifically March 29th of the Xinhai year, the day when the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang were killed in the Guangzhou Uprising. The Chinese nation was awakened by this shock, and revolutionary ideas flourished and could not be suppressed, ultimately achieving the goal of overthrowing autocracy and creating the Republic of China. Originally, today's ceremony was specifically to commemorate the martyrs of Huanghuagang, but since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has been felt that revolutionary martyrs such as Deng Zhongyuan, Hu Zhantang, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Huang Keqiang sacrificed and struggled for the party and the country. Their goals were exactly the same as those of the martyrs of Huanghuagang. Therefore, the dates of the martyrdom and death of these gentlemen are combined on March 29th and held at the same time. Now that our War of Resistance has lasted for thirty-three months, all the heroic soldiers serving in the front lines and compatriots throughout the country who have fought and died for the party and the country are following the revolutionary spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs and sacrificing themselves. They have all become successors of the revolutionary martyrs and have fulfilled important responsibilities in defending the nation and protecting the country. Therefore, the scope of our commemoration has been further expanded, not only to commemorate the martyrs of Huanghuagang, not only to commemorate Deng Zhongyuan, Hu Zhantang, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Huang Keqiang, but also to commemorate all the soldiers and compatriots who sacrificed for the revolution, the Northern Expedition, and the War of Resistance Against Japan. A very solemn general commemoration should be held today to praise their merits and inherit their will, so as to fulfill the responsibilities of those who live on. What is the will of the martyrs? Everyone knows that they wanted freedom and equality for the nation and the country. In the autocratic era, people with blood did not want the people of the whole country to be slaves to one family or one surname, so they wanted to make a revolution and establish a democratic polity to strive for freedom and equality at home. But now, the great rivers and mountains left to us by our ancestors and the Republic of China created by the revolutionary martyrs have been invaded by Japan. Not only can we not talk about the freedom and equality of our individuals, but also threaten the freedom and equality of the entire country and the independent survival of the entire nation. Such a serious national crisis has never been encountered in the five thousand years of Chinese history. We are in this time, and naturally everyone should have a major awakening, everyone should</p>

<p>Recently, the exchange rates of British and American currencies in the Shanghai black market have been fluctuating and trending towards contraction, especially with the US dollar as the center of trading. The forward rate has broken through the six-yuan mark, with significant differences between near and far terms, only slightly converging in the past couple of days. The price of gold has also risen to 5,400 yuan, with active buying and selling. It's unnecessary to predict future changes, but market rumors are worth analyzing.</p>
<p>Generally, what people are most concerned about is how the value of the legal tender will change in the future, and how deeply this will affect the situation. The key seems to lie in this, but that's not actually the case. The value of the currency was originally very stable; what is unstable are speculators' rumors and manipulations. It should be understood that the current value of the legal tender against foreign currencies cannot be maintained at a high level because doing so would cause more harm than good. Moreover, maintaining the Shanghai black market is impossible in the first place. Even a slight attempt to maintain it might bring a brief period of stability to the foreign exchange market, but it will ultimately be ineffective, even harmful. Therefore, the question is not whether to maintain it. The so-called maintenance is just a rumor. Among the rumors, there's talk of gold bonds, which has been circulating for a long time. Initially, the rumor was that four yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for one yuan of gold bond, and four yuan of gold bond could be exchanged for one US dollar. Now, the exchange rate of six yuan per US dollar is already close to this figure, but the gold bonds have not yet been issued. The previous monetary system seemed to become chaotic due to the situation, and the value of the currency went from stable to plummeting. In fact, the situation was not the real cause but was merely exploited by saboteurs and speculators. When the situation clears up, the monetary system will eventually be reorganized. How to reorganize and how to clarify it can be studied as research material, but if it is considered a fact, it will be exploited again, making things more complicated and unhelpful.</p>
<p>As for control, foreign exchange has long been under control, and the fact that Shanghai can still trade freely is abnormal. If the foreign exchange on the market is nationalized, it might become a reality in normal times, like the centralization of silver dollars. However, the current situation is special, and it's difficult to achieve results. Some say that because there will be new changes in the situation, a new form of currency may appear. This is another case of being overly sensitive. The abnormal state already exists. If it's just a change in form without substance, it can't be considered a new change. Haven't we seen the "United Notes" in North China and the "Huaxing Notes" in Central China? When they were first issued, everyone was anxious, thinking it was a cause for concern. But what about now? They are difficult to circulate in the guerrilla areas and cannot be recognized internationally. Some say that the recent high price of gold is a preparation for this. But how much cash can Shanghai collect? Even if there is some collection, the amount is small, only enough for speculative chips. If it is used as a reserve for issuance, it is insignificant! I believe that the biggest reason for the high price of gold is still the worship of money. Speculators who want to get rich, wealthy old women and young women with surplus funds, and local tycoons from the inland who come to Shanghai, all buy gold. Some also rely on the opportunity to plunder and extract ill-gotten gains, fearing unexpected losses if they store it, and worrying about attracting attention if they use it, so they concentrate on buying gold. This is not unique to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>There are more reasons for the contraction of foreign exchange, and some involve foreign countries. For example, the demand for British exchange in New York decreased the other day. The exchange rate also fell, affecting Shanghai. There is a phenomenon of tight US dollars and loose British pounds. Speaking of Shanghai, although reports indicate that foreign trade frequently reports surpluses, the actual number hidden in the high and low exchange rates is very large. If everything is settled according to the black market exchange rate, the amount of the deficit will be higher than in previous years. Let's talk briefly about statistics and see the facts. There is no sign of any contraction in the foreign goods used in the market. On the contrary, because the Japanese control the products and rice, flour, wheat, cotton, etc., in the occupied areas, they still need to seek them from abroad, adding to the leakage of foreign exchange. Moreover, now is not the export season, but foreign goods are imported in a steady stream, and the settlement of exchange payments requires considerable capital. How much capital does Shanghai have for foreign exchange? If the central government does not supply it, what has been accumulated will be limited. If Shanghai relies on its original capital and there is no supply from Hong Kong, how can the exchange rate be what it is today? Moreover, the Japanese are competing with the Chinese for foreign exchange. The Japanese occupy the products of the occupied areas and exchange them for foreign exchange with foreign merchants. This should have belonged to China but has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Recently, they have intensified the absorption of new silkworm cocoons in the occupied areas. Their intention is also to compete for foreign exchange. The more intense the competition for foreign exchange, the more changes in the foreign exchange market. This cannot be regarded as a problem of the currency's value itself.</p>
<p>Living on an isolated island, for the rich, there is no way to use speculation as a tool to increase wealth or use capital flight as a shortcut to preserve property. It must be understood that if the skin is gone, what will the hair stick to? If the legal tender is damaged too much to avoid speculation, the rich have actually devalued their wealth. To realize this, the rich only need to comprehensively calculate their direct and indirect wealth. As for general living, if people still don't know how to be frugal and conserve resources, the consumption of foreign exchange will be more, the rise in prices will be greater, and the difficulties in life will be deeper. When the country is in trouble, not only should people economize to strive for survival, but they should also accumulate wealth for future use. Why pour water into boiling water, add fuel to the fire, and consume it unconsciously! The reason why the financial market is in a state of ruin is that the general public does not examine their living expenses. Although this is regarded as the main reason, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>Knowing that the legacy of the revolutionary martyrs, the unfinished business of the soldiers who died in the war of resistance, and the compatriots who died in the disaster, completely falls on our shoulders, in other words, the freedom and equality of the country, the rise and fall of the nation, and the survival of the nation all depend on us to shoulder this responsibility. Now the situation of the war of resistance has laid a solid foundation for victory through the courageous and hard struggle of the national soldiers, but some unfilial people have fallen into the Japanese poison scheme when the Japanese military has no way, willing to be the Japanese tool, wantonly issue surrender arguments, confuse people's hearts, and recently they have a conspiracy to organize a puppet regime. The Japanese side's attempt is to fight but can't win and want to make peace but can't. Internationally, it has been universally condemned and disgusted. At the same time, its domestic resources are insufficient, its manpower is too small, and there are crises everywhere. It has to change another method of aggression, so it wants to copy the old trick of annexing Korea to create a puppet organization to deceive. The people of our country have already seen this method very clearly, and even the world powers are as clear as fire. In addition to completing his so-called (East Asia New Order) goal, where is there room for the survival of puppets? But those who blindly abandon their conscience insist on being used by the Japanese, especially those who follow the Father of the Nation and the revolutionary martyrs, even willing to be puppets deceive themselves and others, it is really deplorable to check the program of resistance and nation-building, it is clearly stipulated that the national resistance forces, under the leadership of our party and Chairman Chiang, concentrate their efforts and strive forward, and also stipulates (the spirit of independence unites the countries and nations in the world that sympathize with us, and strive together for world peace and justice,) also stipulates (unite all forces against Japanese imperialism's aggression, stop Japanese aggression,) also stipulates (deny and cancel all pseudo-political organizations and their internal and external acts created by Japan in Chinese territory by force) This is the national policy passed by the Provisional National Congress of the Kuomintang of China in April 27th, and the National Government ordered the whole country to abide by it. What qualifications does Wang Zhaoming have to hold a full meeting and central political meeting of the Kuomintang of China, and what qualifications does he have to organize a government? As the chairman, I have been entrusted by our party and cannot but severely criticize to correct the hearing. The Chinese nation has a long history, not only has the power to survive and prosper on its own, but I dare to believe that it can permanently help friendly neighbors who treat me equally, coexist and prosper. In the past difficult process of resistance, this great power can be clearly demonstrated. The friendly countries of the world have given very deep sympathy and assistance to our country's war of resistance. Now that the foundation for the inevitable victory of the war of resistance has been laid, the potential of our great nation has also been proven by facts. I deeply hope that the friendly countries will give consistent sympathy and more assistance, and at the same time, I hope that the heroic soldiers of the country will abide by the party's program and national policy and the orders of the commander-in-chief, adhere to the position of resistance, fight to the end, spare no sacrifice, and spare no hardship, learn the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, follow the revolutionary blood of the martyrs, double their efforts, quickly recover the lost land, rescue the people in the occupied areas, break the conspiracy of the Japanese military閥 and further guarantee the continuous independent survival of the Republic of China, and maintain the world human justice and peace, (29th telegram)</p>
<p>The Central Government Decides to Comfort and Commiserate with the Families of the Martyrs</p>
<p>The Huanghuagang Uprising in Chongqing is the greatest expression of the spirit and righteousness of the Chinese nation. The seventy-two martyrs sacrificed their lives to become benevolent, and their determination to sacrifice was to seek the establishment of the Republic of China for the Chinese nation. The national confidence and persevering spirit of the martyrs are worthy of admiration and emulation. Therefore, the Central Government has long stipulated that this day is the Memorial Day of Revolutionary Martyrs, so that the whole country commemorates this day every year to praise the spirit of the martyrs for striving for the permanent welfare of the country and the nation, and to encourage future generations. Now that the Central Government has recently decided to comfort and commiserate with the families of the martyrs, and is starting to investigate, and for the surviving comrades who participated in this battle, it will also stipulate measures to publicize their achievements, (29th telegram)</p>
<p>All Circles in Chongqing Hold Public Memorial Ceremony and Climbing Competition</p>
<p>Today, all circles in Chongqing and the capital commemorate the March 29th Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day with action. Flags are hung throughout the city. All circles held a memorial meeting at 9:00 a.m., presided over by Hong Lanyou, director of the municipal party headquarters. A congratulatory telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang to pay tribute and inform the whole country. After the meeting, an opening ceremony for the construction of tombs and statues was held in the Du Post Street Square. At 2:00 p.m., all circles held a public memorial ceremony for the revolutionary martyrs at the Yiai Temple in Goose Neck Lane in the suburbs of the city, presided over by Chairman Lin, with government and military leaders in attendance. At the same time, a citizen climbing competition was held in Liziba, with 960 people participating. Chairman Lin and Chen Lifu gave speeches to the participants after the competition, encouraging them. In addition, various organs and groups also organized comfort teams, carrying spring gifts and military consolation gifts donated by the citizens to the wounded soldiers' hospital in the near area to comfort the wounded soldiers. The citizens' emotions were enthusiastic throughout the day, (29th telegram)</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Gave a Broadcast Speech Last Night</p>
<p>Today, on the afternoon of the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day, Chairman Lin of Chongqing gave a broadcast speech to the loyal and brave soldiers and compatriots of the whole country, as well as friends from friendly countries, at 7:00 p.m. The original text roughly stated that today is March 29th, the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, which occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese revolution. At the same time, we commemorate the revolutionary predecessors such as Mr. Deng Zhongyuan, the scope is expanded, and the significance is increased. Now, because of the long-term war of resistance against Japan, all the soldiers who died in battle and the compatriots who were brutally murdered by the Japanese were all sacrificed for the national revolution. They were greatly loyal to the country and filial to the nation. We should also commemorate them together, so the scope of commemoration is further expanded, and the value of commemoration is more important. In such an important memorial day, we should recall the past and encourage the future, especially for the major events related to the war of resistance, we should especially bring them up for review. What should be advocated should naturally be earnestly advocated, and what should be severely criticized should be severely criticized, so that everyone can get the correct understanding, point out our goals of efforts, and make sure that the important tasks entrusted to us by the martyrs will not be neglected or delayed. Now the war of resistance has been going on for thirty-three months, but our army is getting stronger and stronger, and the morale of the people is also more and more uplifted. From the Japanese side, the army is getting weaker and weaker, and the morale of the people is gradually declining. Several important battles have been defeated by the Japanese, without any progress, and they have been universally condemned and unanimously disgusted internationally. At the same time, the Japanese economic situation is gradually declining, resources are gradually lacking, prices are getting more and more expensive, and the military strength and manpower cannot get appropriate replenishment and assistance. Therefore, the Japanese crisis of collapse cannot be resolved, and the foundation for our country's victory has been established. All the money and the soldiers of the war of resistance and the compatriots in the war zone must be comforted. The mission of building the country and restoring the legacy of the martyrs can undoubtedly be quickly completed in our hands, but when our war of resistance has progressed to such an important period, unfortunately, a few traitors have been used by the Japanese warlords to take the rhetoric of humiliating peace, abuse all the original names under the organization of the Kuomintang of China, hold meetings, and have a conspiracy to organize a puppet regime, falsely claiming to inherit the legitimacy to confuse the audience. The Japanese are using this to only make a temporary tool to change the way to invade. The fact is very clear, that is, the Japanese military force has reached the period of exhaustion. Check that Zhao Ming was in the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee on January 1st, 28th, and had resolved to expel him from the party forever. The chairman has been entrusted by the people of the country and all the comrades of the party, and will carry out the mission from beginning to end, working together with President Chiang to supervise the civil and military officials and people of the whole country to protect the integrity of the national territory, sovereignty, freedom and equality. The goal of this day will not be achieved, and the struggle will not end one day. Today, taking advantage of the opportunity to commemorate the martyrs, I solemnly declare to the loyal and brave soldiers and compatriots of the whole country, as well as friends from friendly countries, that our Chinese nation believes that it has the instinct to survive and prosper on its own for thousands of years, and has a history of co-existence and co-prosperity with the nations in the world that treat me equally, and has the power of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. The thirty-three months of the war of resistance have been struggling in difficulties and hardships at all times, and the achievements have been obvious. The people of the world have already had a considerable understanding of China. I hope that all friendly countries will give us consistent sympathy and more assistance from now on, to clarify the real justice of the world. We will also follow the national policy and always repay the friendly countries with the benefits of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and jointly achieve the highest realm of human equality and freedom. Finally, there are a few words to tell the compatriots that since our war of resistance, we have been guided by the wise leadership of President Chiang in the party, and Chiang, who is also the chairman of the government, has supervised the millions of troops in the country to fight hard and persevere with the Japanese. Now the war situation has gradually and steadily shifted from the unfavorable situation in the initial stage to the superior and the final victory is about to come. It is really admirable to be without the fault of the martyrs. This is the great achievement of Chiang, who is also the chairman, and the soldiers of the country, and we cannot help but pay tribute to them. At this time, we hope that the army and the people of the country, no matter north, south, east, or west, should do their best, stick to their posts, unite their hearts and cooperate with the spirit, and adhere to the position of the war of resistance. In particular, they must never forget to think of the occupied land and recover it as soon as possible, and to quickly help the compatriots in the occupied areas who are in dire straits. The heavy responsibility is in front of us, and we are not allowed to delay or procrastinate. We hope that everyone will work hard together and not disappoint our ancestors, the Father of the Nation, and the martyrs, (29th telegram)</p>

<p>London, official circles announced that the Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference decided at its sixth meeting in London yesterday that England and France should not negotiate or conclude a truce treaty or peace treaty unless both parties agree. The two governments, in view of the result of the agreement signed by Simon and Le Reno in December last year, now want to expand the scope of this agreement to all aspects related to the interests and security of both parties. They have therefore agreed to the following solemn declaration. The Central French Government mutually assumes that in the current war, unless each other agrees, they shall not negotiate or conclude a truce treaty or peace treaty, nor shall they discuss peace terms unless they have fully agreed to the conditions necessary for obtaining effective and durable guarantees for the safety of both parties, and they undertake to maintain joint action in all aspects for the period necessary to ensure their safety after the conclusion of the peace treaty and to assist other countries in achieving proposals for an international order to ensure the freedom of the people, the respect for the law, and the maintenance of European peace. The Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference met yesterday morning and resumed the meeting in the afternoon. The French representatives attending were Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Le Reno, Navy Minister Gang Bingji, Aviation Minister Enak, External Secretary-General Lei Rui, Ambassador to England Kau Bin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army General Gan Maolin, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Lieutenant General Darlang, and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force General Weirman. The Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army, Dara, has recently stumbled, and the injuries to his feet have not fully recovered, so he did not come to participate. The English representatives attending were Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Navy Minister Churchill, Army Minister Stanley, Aviation Minister Wood, Deputy Foreign Secretary Cadogan, Air Force Chief of Staff Newell, Navy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Pond, and Army Chief of Staff General Ironside. Both sides reviewed the various developments in the international situation since the last meeting and decided on the future course of action, (29th Huitong News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>London, The Times diplomatic correspondent recently commented on yesterday's Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference, saying that although France and the Soviet Union do not want to expand the recall of the Soviet ambassador, there is no doubt about the tension in the relationship between the two sides. The Entente countries have no consultation on the Soviet Union's prospects. The Soviet Union's policy has become more obvious after betraying England and France in August last year, occupying the islands and seaports in the Baltic Sea, and attacking Finland for no reason. It is heard that French cabinet members are most worried about Germany importing goods through Siberia, and believe that the transportation of minerals by Soviet ships must be strictly prevented. In their eyes, the English detention of two Soviet ships is of the greatest importance, (29th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Paris, diplomatic circles in this question commented that the solemn declaration issued by the current Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference has officially confirmed the close and lasting alliance between the two countries in all aspects. Its nature is very important and historical. Political figures say that England and France should continue to cooperate after the end of the war and use the various principles made at this time as the basis for the establishment of a new European order. The right to establish a new order is shared by all countries in the world, and is not monopolized by England and France alone. This has been recognized by England and France, (28th Havas telegram)</p>
<p>Rome, this cabinet political circles believe that the communique issued after yesterday's Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference is the most important and solemn declaration of the solidarity of the Entente countries since the outbreak of the war. The Entente countries do not want to take the initiative in any peace talks. This can be seen at a glance in this communique. People in political circles feel that if there is a little hope for an acceptable peace proposal during the visit of US Undersecretary of State Welles to Europe, the Entente countries would not have issued such a clear announcement, and the feeling that a war dreaded by the whole of Europe is bound to occur in the spring is also strengthened as a result. England and France's undertaking to take joint action not only during the war but also in various aspects of the post-war political settlement can eliminate the various disputes between England and France over war objectives, (29th Reuters telegram)</p>

<p>London, political figures here recently said that after the Anglo-French Supreme Defense Committee held a joint meeting here today, Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately telegraphed the envoys to the Balkan countries to return home to report on their duties, which shows that the nature of this meeting is extremely important, and there is no doubt that the relationship between England and the Soviet Union will enter a new stage. England and France are now considering expanding the blockade measures on the sea and land, and its scope will far exceed what was implemented in the previous world war. Although the Soviet Union has made representations to the United Kingdom, intending to prevent the implementation of certain measures, it has completely failed. In short, although the Soviet Union has strongly said "neutrality," the facts are quite different. At this time, the country may not take military action against England and France. In case of reckless action, England and France also have the means to deal with it, (28th Havas telegram)</p>
<p>London, well-informed sources here recently said that England and France will immediately take various measures to intensify the implementation of the lock policy, and will negotiate with various neutral countries, especially the countries in the Scandinavian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. Regarding the Soviet Union, although it will not take harsh actions, the blockade measures may be extended to the Black Sea, or agreements may be made with other countries to restrict the activities of the Soviet Union. In short, England and France maintain a peaceful attitude towards the Soviet Union, but after the two Soviet ships "Selinga" and "Makowski" were intercepted by British warships some time ago, the British government does not intend to release them, and it is unlikely that they will still occur in the short term, (28th Havas telegram)</p>
<p>London, political figures here said that the Anglo-French agreement is now complete and flawless, and there is no reservation. Both sides will therefore take large-scale, comprehensive and resolute actions to make the war enter a new stage. Although the German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said, "Germany will let the war corrode", (which means letting the war be long and silent), England and France really have a way to break this plan. In short, this joint meeting discussed the issue of surrounding Germany, especially intensifying the blockade. England and France have not strictly implemented the blockade policy in order to minimize the damage suffered by the neutral countries, so that some neutral countries have obviously facilitated Germany, some are out of fear, such as the small countries in Northern Europe, and some are out of sympathy, such as the Soviet Union. All this is well known to England and France, but the only goal of England and France is to defeat Germany, so it is difficult to tolerate this for a long time. Therefore, the National Defense Joint Meeting today discussed this and has decided to take various actions to correct it. Although the responsible parties have not explained the content of this decision, they have revealed that the area where the blockade measures are implemented will be expanded in the future. All routes communicating with Germany, whether on land or at sea, should be gradually blockaded, especially for the blockade of land transportation, (28th Havas telegram)</p>

<p>Istanbul: The Turkish press today declared that while Turkey may be forced into war due to some indirect cause, it has decided to cooperate with England and France. This stance by the Turkish press is a response to the news of the German-Soviet-Italian understanding and the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini reaching Turkey. A certain authoritative Turkish newspaper cited a recent essay by Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras, stating that establishing a sphere of influence in the Balkans is a desire for war. The newspaper, quoting the essay, also declared, "Any action by a strong power against any Balkan country is an action against Turkey. Turkey cannot tolerate any country establishing influence in the Balkan Peninsula. Those who wish to establish influence must know that Turkey is present." Another influential newspaper issued a similar warning, stating that Turkey will oppose any interference in the Balkans. Currently, foreign aggression has not yet reached Turkey, so Turkey will not be drawn into the war. However, preparations must be made to be prepared. Well-informed sources say that Turkey is expected to continue close military cooperation with England and France in the Near East, and coordinated action can be implemented when necessary. A Turkish expert said that the military talks between England, France, and Turkey include many agreements regarding the steps to be taken in wartime. The final resolution of these issues will require a considerable amount of time. (United Press, 29th)</p>

<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here recently commented that after Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Rome and talks with Italian authorities, it is heard that he felt that the rumors of rapprochement between Italy and the Soviet Union were not as serious as external reports suggested. Generally, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had requested Hungary not to make territorial demands before the end of the current European war. As to whether Italy should provide assistance to Hungary if it is threatened by the Soviet Union in the future, it is currently unknown. However, the hasty trip to Rome by Hungarian Air Force Commander Colonel Horthy before Prime Minister Teleki's departure from Italy to seek advice also has significant implications. In addition, the Italian government is currently doing its best to ease relations between Hungary and Romania, thereby stabilizing the situation in Southeastern Europe. Germany, on the other hand, is trying to make Hungary and Romania constantly feel "threatened by Hungary" and boasting that only Germany can help Romania relieve this threat, but only on the condition that Romania grant Germany certain special economic benefits. As for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement that if Hungary and Romania wish to assist Hungary in the future, they must pass through Yugoslavia, it is said. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>Helsinki: After the establishment of the peace agreement between the Soviet Union and Finland, the government authorities recently released statistics illustrating the economic losses incurred. It is stated that the territories ceded to the Soviet Union include: (1) 50,000 hectares of arable land, accounting for 10% of the country's farmland; (2) 400 factories, whose total annual output value reaches 1,000,000,000 Finnish marks, also accounting for 10% of the country's industry; (3) multiple copper and iron mines in the town of Pitkäranta. In order to handle the aftermath, the Finnish authorities are actively carrying out a reconstruction plan to provide work for the 420,000 residents evacuated from the ceded areas. At the same time, 60,000 houses are being built in various rural villages and 30,000 houses are being built in various cities to accommodate these refugees. Finnish economic experts are not overly pessimistic about the current situation, believing that Finland's economic organization has not been destroyed and is easy to restore. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>Washington: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles has arrived here, seemingly satisfied with the results of his trip to Europe. He claims to have had various opportunities to seek information from all aspects as he was ordered, but does not comment on the results he obtained. After arriving here, he visited Secretary of State Hull for a brief chat, and then went with Hull to the White House to report everything to President Roosevelt. Opinion here expresses the view that Welles's trip to Europe has not brought any optimistic feeling about the possibility of peace. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles returned here yesterday morning after traveling to the capitals of various European countries. He carried a small brown leather bag containing confidential reports and went straight to the State Department. Welles remained silent about his talks with the leaders of various European countries. He then went to the White House and spoke with President Roosevelt for forty-five minutes. Officials here predict that part of Welles's report will discuss the possibility of the European war extending to Asia due to the tension between the Allies and the Soviet Union. In addition to the French government demanding that the Soviet Union recall Soviet Ambassador Surits to France and the Allies seizing Soviet copper mine transport, rumors here are that Germany will begin submarine warfare from the Soviet coast to the Sea of Japan. Officials here believe that the implementation of a partial blockade in the Pacific indicates that the Allies are confident that the situation in the Atlantic is completely under the Allies' control. Reporters learned that Welles denied that he had discussed a peace plan in Rome. Over the past three weeks, Mussolini has given the impression that the Axis powers have a chance of winning. Italy has resumed using the term "Axis powers." The Allies are confident that they can obtain air superiority and have resources sufficient to continue the war for eight to ten years. The Allies' current confidence in the effectiveness of the blockade of Germany is not as strong as it was two months ago. The Soviet Union remains an unknown determining factor. There is no sign of disunity in Germany's internal morale. Welles or anyone else has very little chance of finding a mutually acceptable way to achieve peace in the near future.

At the same time, the British envoys to Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria will also return home at the summons of Foreign Secretary Halifax for a trip. Diplomatic circles then commented that the British government is likely to begin large-scale diplomatic activities to understand whether the countries of the Balkan Peninsula can support the measures to be taken by England and France, and to explore whether these countries have suffered economic losses due to the intensified blockade by England and France. In addition, the relations between the countries of the Balkan Peninsula and the Soviet Union will also be discussed. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Berlin: Political figures here recently commented on the Allied plan to organize a patrol fleet in neutral waters, saying that this plan is tantamount to encroaching on the police power of neutral countries. If implemented, incidents of violating neutrality will continue to occur, and there will be no meaning of neutrality. The Berlin newspapers all focused on the territorial waters of neutral countries. The "Berlin Evening News" said that due to the lack of supervision by "Paris Soir," the Allies' true intentions have been revealed to the outside world, that is, the Allies intend to declare the territorial waters of Norway and other countries as war zones, making neutral countries victims of British attacks.

<p>Washington: Reporters learned today that Germany has voluntarily assured the United States that it will not attack American merchant ships in its launched intense naval warfare. Although this action is confidential, it also has a formal nature. According to reliable diplomatic sources, German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder gave a formal guarantee to U.S. Naval Attaché in Berlin Commander Schultze several weeks ago and has adhered to it ever since. It is noteworthy that American ships have indeed been spared from sinking recently, while other neutral countries' tonnage losses are still in the thousands. According to observations from diplomatic circles here, it is believed that Admiral Raeder must have allowed that if the United States fulfills all the conditions of the so-called Lusitania Agreement and continues to prohibit American ships from sailing to ports in belligerent countries, then during the war, he will absolutely obey the order not to attack American ships. It is also said that Raeder also guaranteed that if American ships are escorted by British warships to Kirkwall Port on Pomona Island, northern Scotland, or other contraband control bases for British inspection, and the United States continues to protest this action to England, then these ships will have no danger of being bombed. As for why Raeder took this action, diplomatic circles here believe that there are two reasons, namely, Germany hopes to regain the goodwill of the United States and fears the United States' economic assistance to the Allies.

<p>London: It has recently been learned that new British-built long-range fighter planes are more powerful than enemy aircraft of the same type. Although the details of new fighter planes or bombers are not allowed to be disclosed during wartime, it is known that the new aircraft currently produced are stronger than those currently used. British aircraft such as the Vickers Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane are already world leaders in fighter plane design, but progress in bomber construction still requires continued improvements in fighter plane achievements. It is now heard that the characteristics of the new British fighter planes are higher speed, greater horsepower, stronger armament, and longer range. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry recently stated that yesterday, when several British aircraft were patrolling the skies over the North Sea, they encountered two enemy aircraft. After a long battle, one German aircraft was repeatedly hit, and the damage was clearly quite significant. This aircraft probably failed to return to its base, while all the British aircraft returned. One British aircraft had engine trouble on the left side but still landed safely at an airfield in eastern Scotland. According to the gunner in the aircraft, they fought in the sky for half an hour. When they were returning to base, one enemy aircraft, due to repeated hits from British gunfire, had thick smoke coming out. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>Amsterdam: A British bomber was shot down by Dutch fighter planes near Rotterdam, the Netherlands, yesterday morning. The four pilots of the aircraft seemed to recognize that they were in France, so when Dutch soldiers in blue uniform asked them if they were British, the British pilots were surprised. When the Dutch soldiers asked them where they came from, the British pilots carefully replied, "We come from somewhere." The British aircraft had five crew members, one of whom jumped out of the aircraft as the wreckage caught fire, resulting in his death. The remaining four were not injured. After recovering the body of their companion, they were taken to a coffee shop for a drink and met Norman, the Dutch pilot who shot down the British aircraft, and exchanged views, making technical discussions. Neither side had any ill will. At that time, Norman was still wearing pajamas under his flight suit. According to Dutch sources, the British bomber had fired back at the Dutch fighter planes.

<p>The Washington government previously submitted a bill to the Senate regarding trade agreements between the United States and other countries, requesting a three-year extension of the power for the President to sign trade agreements with other countries without prior Senate approval. However, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed an amendment insisting that trade agreements must first be approved by the Senate. According to political figures here, the Senate may bring the bill to a vote tomorrow. Based on the current situation, senators appear to be evenly divided between those who support and oppose the government's original proposal. However, the government authorities are deeply aware that if Pittman's amendment is passed, the effectiveness of the original bill will be greatly reduced, and they are now working hard to win over Democratic senators in order to ensure that the original bill passes in tomorrow's vote.

<p>Tokyo, The Yomiuri Shimbun recently published an editorial examining the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. It stated, "Earlier in February, when the Japanese House of Representatives convened, negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union were widely discussed, and there were general hopes that the two sides could conclude a trade agreement through this. However, so far, there has been no progress, probably due to political reasons, resulting in a stalemate. If this is indeed the case, then the Japanese-Soviet negotiations will undoubtedly fail, just like the previous negotiations between 'Manchukuo' and 'Mongolia' on the demarcation of the Nomonhan border. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech at the Supreme Soviet last September, hoping to improve relations with Japan. In reality, since the Soviet Union reached a peace agreement with Finland, Soviet policy has been to offend Japan. The Soviet Union cannot improve its relationship with Japan as long as it does not cease supporting the Chinese Nationalist Government. Moreover, according to outside rumors, the Soviet Union has concentrated the Red Army in the Far East since the end of the Finnish war. Although the number of troops and their intentions are unknown, it is clear from the recent incident of the Red Army attacking a Japanese patrol team on Sakhalin Island that the Soviet Far East policy has undergone significant changes." In addition, well-informed sources stated that the Japanese House of Peers Budget Committee held its first meeting yesterday, and the Army and Navy Ministers publicly answered questions about Japan's relations with the Soviet Union. Their responses revealed the delicate nature of the current relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Observing from All Angles, Italy Is Incapable of Joining the War; Mussolini Is Growing Old <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>There have been widespread rumors in Europe recently that a major war will break out in the spring, at which point Italy, which has been sitting on the fence, will have to take action. Italy has been an enigma in the European situation since the outbreak of the European war, or perhaps it is just a paper tiger. According to American newspapers and magazines, Italy really does not have the ability to join the war. The analysis is as follows.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Italy's highest authorities. The American magazine "American Mercury" had the following report. It is said that not long ago, an old friend went to the Palazzo Venezia to see Mussolini by appointment. Mussolini, who has always been punctual, was a few minutes late. He rushed upstairs, panting, and said, "I must be getting old." He immediately realized he had misspoke, frowned, and hurriedly changed his tone, saying, "I hate getting old the most. My mind is muddled, my movements are slow. I'd rather die than grow old." He is currently 57 years old, and there is not much change in his appearance, but the wrinkles on his face are deep. In the past, he did not trust anyone. He personally presided over everything, no matter how big or small, and when he issued orders, he would prescribe the steps of execution in detail. Once, he boasted that he was the only competent person in Italy, but that is not the case anymore. He has gradually transferred his duties to Ciano, Grandi, and Balbo. Now, everything in Italy is becoming lax. Many military commanders complain about the difficulty of supplying the country's army. Roman observers believe that Mussolini is waiting for an opportunity to act, but many of Mussolini's aides do not agree, saying that he is getting old and no longer has the courage to make a difference.</p>
<p>In terms of finances, Italy also has the pain of not being able to participate in the war. According to a New York Herald-Tribune correspondent in Rome, land transportation in Europe has been hit hard by the war, and the severe cold in Northern Europe has completely stopped the transportation of coal to Italy. The country is in danger of running out of fuel. The Italian authorities' boast of being prepared to deal with everything has been shattered. According to reports from the northern industrial area of Italy, the fuel reserves of the factories were originally insufficient, and now they are almost exhausted. Some places only have enough to last for a week. Although Italy's railways have been largely electrified, 130 trains have been suspended due to a shortage of coal. This situation is entirely due to the government's "laissez-faire" policy, which has been trying to save foreign exchange. This alone shows that Mussolini's repeated declarations of economic self-sufficiency are nothing more than empty promises.</p>
<p>Most of the coal used by Italy has always been supplied by Germany, Belgium, Poland, and other countries. There are two main transportation lines. One is from Hamburg, Germany, by sea to Genoa, Italy. The other is from the Rhine River and the Danube River to Austria, and then by rail to Italy. The Italian authorities have already prepared 6,000 freight cars for coal transportation. However, the sea route has been blockaded by the British, and Italy needs to rely on Britain for some of its coal supply.</p>
<p>Although there are widespread rumors that "something will happen" this spring, we can infer Italy's externally strong but internally weak situation by carefully studying this shortage of fuel supply and reserves. It is also rumored that Italian schools will have an indefinite vacation starting from the Easter holiday, so that the schools can be converted into hospitals when necessary. However, according to observers, Italy needs to rely on both belligerent countries for the supply of raw materials. It is simply unimaginable to fight against them. Empty domestic reserves and empty talk of preparing for war are not enough to cause alarm. The "something will happen in the spring" claim, if it has any meaning, may be to deal with the Soviet Union, which is unable to control Italy's source of raw materials.</p>
<p>Looking at the troop deployment in the Mediterranean and African colonies, it seems that Britain and France do not regard Italy as their future enemy. According to the most reliable estimates, the French forces concentrated in Syria are about 250,000, of which about 100,000 were transferred from French mobile units, and about 115,000 were transferred from the French territories in North Africa. The original garrison in Syria and the troops transferred from Madagascar and Vietnam totaled about 40,000. With such a concentration of French troops, the garrison in North Africa is bound to be reduced to a minimum, but there has been no news of any reduction in the 200,000-strong garrison in the Italian territory of Libya.</p>
<p>At the same time, the entire British Mediterranean Fleet has been transferred to the Atlantic Ocean. At a time when the so-called "new front" in the Balkans and the Near East is becoming tense, are Britain and France not afraid of the Italian navy cutting off Mediterranean traffic? Although the British and French naval and military authorities believe that Italy's strength is weak and not worth worrying about, a country with 100 submarines and 1,800 aircraft is still a force to be reckoned with in the narrow waterway between Sicily and Tunisia. Italy's political influence in the Balkans is also very active and cannot be ignored. If Britain and France use Egypt and Syria as bases to attack the Soviet Caucasus, or pass through Turkey and send troops to the Balkans, hostile Italy would have the power to carry out containment operations on the border between Egypt and Libya, and could also look into British-Egyptian Sudan or British East Africa from Abyssinia.</p>
<p>The British and French military authorities are naturally aware of this danger, but they are still carrying out their naval and military deployments in the Mediterranean as if nothing is happening. The meaning of this is worth exploring.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces Jointly Implement Maritime Traffic Control to Prevent Japanese Goods from Being Transported and Sold Inland <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Jinzhou Correspondence, Since the Japanese side colluded with pirates to occupy the coastal islands of Fujian and Zhejiang, they have coerced the people on the islands to transport Japanese goods and opium to remote coasts in exchange for food, livestock, and various necessities, or to absorb legal tender. Although the Chinese military and political organs have strictly investigated and prohibited it, it is difficult to eradicate it completely due to the length of the coastline and the diversity of ports. Now, the military authorities of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces have jointly formulated five measures to restrict shipping and promulgated them for implementation: (1) During periods of military tension, coastal ports can be prohibited from navigation if it is deemed necessary to blockade them; (2) All Chinese and foreign ships must apply to the competent shipping administration for a pass when sailing in martial law areas; (3) All routes and berthing locations not specified in the pass are not allowed to navigate; (4) If the military authorities believe that a certain place or port should be suspended within a certain period, they must notify the competent shipping administration to investigate and approve the suspension of the route there; (5) Any Chinese and foreign merchant ships that enter prohibited ports or navigate without a pass will be dealt with in three ways depending on the severity of the circumstances: (a) No passengers or cargo are allowed on or off, and the ship is returned to its original port; (b) Contact with the shore is prohibited; (c) Part or all of the cargo is confiscated. The aforementioned handling will be carried out by the local military commander, the local government, and the shipping administration.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to prevent ships from Fujian Province from smuggling Japanese goods, the headquarters of the 8th War Area has established the Fujian Water and Land Joint Transport Management Office, and has established offices in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Sandu, Hanjiang, Haicheng, Tong'an, Shacheng, Changle, Lianjiang, and Fuqing, the ports of entry and exit for merchant ships, to implement maritime traffic control. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, all ships entering and leaving the above ports must apply for inspection. If it is found that prohibited goods are being transported in or out, they will be detained. In addition, various ships entering and leaving the coastal ports must pay public welfare funds to the local tax authorities. It is stipulated that merchant ships pay two yuan per net ton for each import, and one yuan for each export. Transport ships (excluding sailboats, small cargo ships, and fishing boats) are calculated by weight, with a tax of 1.5 cents per market dan for each import and export. The public welfare funds are handed over to the provincial treasury to be used as wartime subsidies for the province.</p>

<p>Captured by Guerrilla Troops</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence, Hong Qiliang, the former director of the Food Office in this county, is from Dongmen in the town. He opened Hong Cunrentang and served as the manager of Tong Shoutai Guanzhang Garden. He is a treacherous and evil person, hiding a dagger behind his smile. However, he is skilled in socializing, so he is also a well-known figure in Dinghai. Two years ago, he was attacked by the people for hoarding rice, and the county government ordered his arrest and investigation. After this county fell, Hong resumed his activities and hoarded rice again, causing rice prices to soar and the poor to suffer. A few days ago, Hong went to Chen Shaomei's house in Dongjiao. When he was returning to the city and was walking to Tuchengdun in Dongjiao, he was suddenly captured by Chinese guerrilla troops. He was immediately escorted to Zhoujia Island for interrogation. Because of his many misdeeds and exploitation of the people, he was immediately subjected to severe punishment to warn the public.</p>

<p>Confiscating Civilian Houses and Tombs</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence, The Japanese military authorities stationed in Suzhou have ordered the construction of two barracks in this city, stipulating that they must accommodate 3,000 soldiers. Guangye immediately sent several Japanese officers, accompanied by Dong Youxian, the police chief of the puppet provincial capital, to find a location. After surveying, they designated the area around the Huayuan Hotel and Li Jizong Lane as the construction site. However, because the area was too small, they also confiscated a piece of public tomb land nearby. They have now started construction, first leveling the high ground on the tombs, resulting in bones and corpses scattered all over the ground.</p>

<p>Because the "New Government" will be officially inaugurated in Nanjing, the education circles in this city have launched a one-day strike today (30th) to show their support for the Chongqing Central Government.</p>
<p>The Education Federation Issues a Letter to the Education Community</p>
<p>The Education Federation of this city issued a letter to the entire education community, stating that the Japanese warlords, because they have been bogged down deeper and deeper for two and a half years, know that they can never achieve victory militarily, so they want to cultivate puppets to achieve their sinister schemes of "using Chinese to control Chinese" and "using war to support war." We must explain the shameless activities of the puppets and the Japanese conspiracy to benefit the puppets to your students, so that they all deeply understand that the puppet organization is only the last struggle before the final collapse of the Japanese. With the united opposition of our heroic soldiers and patriotic people, it will definitely decline quickly. However, although the puppet organization is destined to fail from the day it was established, people in the education community must unite, have a firm belief, and the Japanese and puppet conspiracy will fail. Teachers at all levels of schools must continue to work hard on the work of the education community itself in the movement against the puppet organization, consolidate the organization of the education community itself, use collective strength, and fight the puppets to the end. The final victory will definitely be ours. Finally, the passionate expression of the patriotic young students in the city today is not a suspension of classes, but a strike to strike at the puppet organization. We in the entire education community extend our greatest sympathy. We teachers and students must, in the spirit of close cooperation, unify our steps and align our pace, so that this movement can fully exert our great strength.</p>
<p>The Education Federation of this city also sent a telegram to the entire country yesterday. The Lide Fraternity, leading more than 40 organizations such as the Moral and Physical Education Association, also sent out a telegram yesterday.</p>
<p>All teachers and staff in the city decided to strike for one day today and issue a declaration. Students from all schools in the city issued a declaration and decided to implement a general strike for one day on March 30.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Restoring Ancient Chinese Educational Methods, Arming Education, President Chiang's Public Banquet for Educational Conference Representatives, Personal Admonition <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) On March 19th, at 6:30 PM, Executive Yuan President Chiang and Vice President Kung hosted a public banquet at the Yuan for representatives of the National People's Education Conference, accompanied by Wei Daoming, Chen Lifu, Chiang Tingfu, and senior officials from various departments of the Executive Yuan. Over fifty people attended, including education directors from various provinces and representatives. During the banquet, President Chiang gave a speech, the gist of which was: "Our educational goals and all educational opinions are the same as those expressed at last year's National Education Conference. However, today's education, especially the fundamental national education, should particularly pay attention to restoring the ancient Chinese methods of education: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic. For the past twenty or thirty years, everyone has neglected this, so our spirit is failing, our physical strength is failing, and the general population is so weak, ignorant, and foolish, leading to such national humiliation. Japan, on the other hand, has been able to absorb our ancient educational methods, so their people are physically stronger than us. Since the start of the war of resistance, we have had a good opportunity to avoid the environment of the large cities along the rivers and coasts and come to the interior, naturally giving us the opportunity to restore ancient educational methods and arm education. If our education leaders, educators, and teachers cannot seize this opportunity to correct past mistakes and bring out the effectiveness of education, they are truly sinners of the nation. Secondly, in the future, schools must ensure that students understand the principles of being a person in addition to science, especially approaching daily life. Zeng Guofan's education of his children involved eight characters: examination, treasure, early, sweeping, books, vegetables, fish, and pigs. These eight characters encompass all of daily life. Our students today must put effort into these eight characters. Every school should follow this principle, and depending on the suitability of the environment and the permissible objective circumstances, find ways to do it. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to protecting livestock and plants, not allowing the mistreatment of animals, and not allowing the destruction of trees. This should be written into national education textbooks to cultivate students' virtues of benevolence and cherishing things. In short, past education has been harmful education. Today's education, if it does not educate students to be close to daily life and educate students in the skills of rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, then everyone will be a sinner of the nation. These are a few words that I am adding to my speech from last time. I respectfully raise a glass to all of you and wish you good health."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Children's Day Preparations Need Sanitary Supplies <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>To Distribute to Refugee Children</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the celebration of Children's Day in this city, with the Children's Day on April 4th approaching rapidly, is working in a very tense manner. In order to comfort the refugee children in this city on Children's Day, the committee decided to solicit 10,000 gifts, including towels, handkerchiefs, refined fruits, pencils, writing brushes, practice notebooks, scratchpads, children's machines, toothbrushes, etc. It has sent letters to major companies and shops asking for donations. It is reported that the committee received 1,000 children's books from Guangxue Bookstore, 20 yuan from Nanyang Sock Factory, 200 writing brushes from Feng Xietang, 60 pairs of children's socks from Hua'an Department Store, 42 pairs of children's socks from Huamei Department Store, 5 yuan for towels, 72 pencils from Kaiming Company, 464 packages of candy from all employees of Kaili Company, and 25 writing brushes from Dachuan Bookstore yesterday. Furthermore, in order to understand the needs of the refugee children, the committee instructed its staff to conduct an investigation. According to the committee's investigation, there are 40 locations with a total of over 18,600 children, including 12,490 children from child welfare organizations and 1,696 children from the main schools and refugee hospitals. In terms of needed items, sanitary supplies such as toothbrushes and towels are most needed, followed by educational stationery and candy and food. If enthusiastic people from all walks of life donate cash, the committee can also purchase the items on their behalf. The methods are as follows: (1) Towels or handkerchiefs: 1.80 yuan per dozen; (2) Candy: 0.20 yuan per package; (3) Pencils or writing brushes: 0.60 yuan per dozen; (4) Practice notebooks or scratchpads: 0.60 yuan per dozen; (5) Children's socks: 2.40 yuan per dozen; (6) Toothbrushes: 2.40 yuan per dozen.

Poor Children's Relief Institute (915 Pudong Building, Avenue Edward.)</p>
<p>In another report, the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association received a reply from the French Public Concession, stating that it was inconvenient to arrange for groups of children to visit the park on Children's Day under the current circumstances, which was very regrettable. It also received a reply from the Public Works Department, stating that any schools, child welfare organizations, and shelters in the city that wish to have children visit the parks in the Public Concession on Children's Day must send a letter directly to the department via the association by the 31st of this month to apply for free passes.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw fluctuations.

Operators either closed out positions or temporarily withdrew, resulting in no market reaction. Moreover, the drastically declining US and UK exchange rates suddenly rebounded by 1.0625 angles (currency measurement). After the opening, the market showed a state of British tightness and American looseness, calculated as 4 pence 1.40625 and 6.21875 yuan, respectively. Shortly after, Chinese merchants and Japanese banks jumped in, and the momentum softened again, initially at 4 pence 1.125 and the US dollar at 6.15625 yuan. Due to the varying actions of Chinese merchants, with both buying and selling, there were no significant price changes. In the afternoon, the situation became lively again. Fortunately, the bulls among the Chinese merchants resumed selling, and after a certain bank offered sales, the market hardened. At the close of trading, it ended at 4 pence 1.40625 and 6.15625 yuan, resulting in a British tightening of 0.015625 and an American loosening of 0.065 (combined US and UK exchange rates were 3 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, 8125 li). The difference between futures and spot prices remained the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Market Opens with British Tightness and American Looseness</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London next day rate rose 1.875 for both near and far terms. New York silver prices remained flat, and London raw material prices remained stable. Exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar rebounded 1.0625 angles against the British pound, rose 1 jiao against Shanghai, and 6 fen against the French franc. The Central Bank's official rate was not available due to the holiday. The opening selling price for spot exchange rates at banks was 4 pence 1.40625 for the British pound and 6.21875 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the previous closing, a British tightening of 0.015625 and an American strengthening of 1.125, due to the exchange rate rebound. After the opening, Chinese merchants bought in cheaply, and Japanese banks were also active, causing the market to suddenly tighten. Speculators and Japanese banks bought US dollar exchange rates of 6 yuan and 5.9375 yuan for April. At that time, spot prices also softened to 4 pence 1.125 and 6.15625 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's official rate was not revealed. After that, Chinese merchants made small trades, and Chinese banks also traded intermittently. However, the market was mediocre. Speculators sold US dollar exchange rates of 5.9375 yuan and 6 yuan for April to Chinese banks. Later, another Chinese merchant absorbed US dollar exchange rates of 5.96875 yuan and 6 yuan for April from Chinese banks. Foreign banks also traded among themselves, profiting from rolling over the current month into April, paying out British gold of 0.078125, equivalent to interest of about 2%. At that time, British gold slightly rebounded to 4 pence 1.40625, while the US dollar remained at 6.15625 yuan. At noon, buying and selling thinned out, and the situation became even quieter, with no movement until the afternoon close, unchanged from the morning opening, with British rates flat and American rates tightening by 0.0625.</p>
<p>Roll-Over Still Seen Widening</p>
<p>The market opened slightly soft in the afternoon, with British rates only at 4 pence 1.125 and the US dollar at 6.125 yuan. Subsequently, some Chinese merchants slightly sold off, stabilizing the market. Speculators sold April British gold at 4 pence 0.0625 to Youli. Later, a certain bank sold spot US dollar exchange rates at 6.15625 yuan to a counterpart. After entering the market, speculators traded the April rate, but there was not much activity. Until the evening close, British gold was 4 pence 1.40615 and the US dollar was 6.15625 yuan. Next month's British rate was 4 pence 0.046875, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 6875. As a result, the spot rate compared to the previous day saw British rates tighten by 0.015625 and American rates loosen by 0.0625. Next month's British rates also tightened by 0.015625, while American rates strengthened by 0.03125.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Foreign Currency Returns Low <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a sharp decrease in demand for British and American gold pounds, and market prices were weak. The supply of British gold notes was abundant and turned strong, and the trend was weak. US gold notes ultimately weakened due to the sharp rebound in the pound price, but there were many changes in the middle. It initially traded at 16.10 yuan, then rose to 16.27 yuan, and then fell to 16.07 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 16.15 yuan, and in the afternoon it once again rose to 16.20 yuan, eventually ending at 16.16 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong notes did not decrease. Canadian notes and Philippine notes were both very weak. Demand and supply for French franc notes and Annam notes remained balanced.

<h3 id="e69">Gold Market Crowded with Sellers, End-of-Month Tight Money, Longs Have to Temporarily Sell <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot raw gold market saw a slight flattening and weakness. Although a certain money exchange house acted as an agent and aggressively bought, there were also lots of seven or eight hundred taels. However, there were quite a few sellers, mainly due to the end-of-month relationship and tight money, resulting in many longs having to temporarily sell. However, most people still have a bullish outlook. In the early morning, exchange rates reported gains, and the US dollar loosened. Immediately after opening, it was suppressed by as much as 30 yuan, to 5,350 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange house took the lead in selling to the market, falling by another 20 yuan. Then, due to the exchange market soon tightening, a certain money exchange house urgently dragged in on behalf of a customer, reaching a peak of 5,380 yuan. However, securities houses and gold shops were determined to sell off, and it gradually declined. By about 11:00, it had fallen to a low price of 5,315 yuan. At noon, retail investors cheaply re-entered the market, pulling it up by 30 yuan. However, due to securities houses selling again, it ended the afternoon at 5,325 yuan. After the market opened in the afternoon, foreign exchange tightened again, and the market improved. A certain securities house came back to buy, and once again reached a high of 5,370 yuan. However, longs took profits, and foreign exchange rebounded. Until the evening close, it retreated to 5,355 yuan, resulting in a softening of 25 yuan compared to the 10th. Total trading volume for the day was about 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry from silver shops followed, falling by 5 yuan. Customs gold, etc., had no official rates because the Central Bank was closed on the Yellow Flower Mound Memorial Day, as usual.</p>
<p>First Trade Immediately Down 30 Yuan</p>
<p>From the early morning, each bar (ten taels) opened, and exchange rates reported gains of over 1 jiao, and the US dollar reported loosening. Therefore, people's hearts were weak, and it immediately fell by 30 yuan. Money exchange houses mutually traded 20 taels for 5,350 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange houses and securities houses sold off, falling by another 20 yuan. Securities houses sold 10 taels to silver shops for 5,330 yuan. Then, the exchange market reported tightening, exciting people's hearts. In addition, a certain money exchange house repeatedly bought, and it gradually rose by 50 yuan. A certain money exchange house bought dozens of taels from gold shops, etc., for 5,380 yuan. After that, another money exchange house took advantage of the high price to strongly sell, and securities houses and gold shops followed with competitive sales. Although a certain money exchange house still came to pull in, their buying power had weakened, and it fell again by 40 yuan, reaching 5,340 yuan. After it briefly stabilized, due to foreign exchange loosening, longs sold off one after another, and securities houses also sold off again, falling again by 25 yuan. Securities houses sold 30 taels to silver shops for 1,000 315 yuan. At that time, silver shops slightly bought cheaply, and retail sellers re-entered the market, causing it to rise by 30 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from securities houses for 5,345 yuan. In the end, due to gold shops taking the opportunity to sell again, it fell again by 20 yuan. Silver shops mutually traded 50 taels for 5,325 yuan, the closing price at noon. After the market opened in the afternoon, due to the exchange market reporting softening, it immediately rose by 15 yuan. Gold shops mutually traded 30 taels for 5,340 yuan. After a short while, it retreated by 5 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to securities houses for 5,335 yuan. Then, because a certain securities house suddenly came to buy again, and silver shops and gold shops also absorbed from time to time, the price rose by 35 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from silver shops for 5,370 yuan. After people slightly sold off, foreign exchange rebounded, and it retreated by 15 yuan. Gold shops sold 10 taels to silver shops for 5,355 yuan. Last night's closing price resulted in a softening of 25 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading range for the whole day was 65 yuan. The selling price of the gold from the current Yuhao sign is several yuan higher than the spot raw gold. The buying price has been reduced by 20 yuan. The current margin gold is over 50 yuan lower than the official gold, and both are rarely traded.</p>
<p>Jewelry Initially Flat, Then Slightly Lower</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry was initially sold for 500 45 yuan per liang by Datonghang. Then, at 9:40, it was slightly lowered by 5 yuan. There were no changes after that.

<p>London, 28th (wire): The silver market saw the public buying in, with limited supply. Business was small, and the market was stable. After the close, it remained calm.

Mumbai silver wire: The Indian silver market was stable, with spot and April prices each rising by 1 anna. A total of 50 trades were made.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Securities, Domestic Debt Rebounds, Foreign Stocks Decline Slightly <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The securities grey market saw sudden ups and downs yesterday, with fluctuations quite rapid. The difference between the high and low prices reached half a yuan. Although the news was still dull, there were significant changes in supply and demand. Initially, it fell due to extremely tight credit, but suddenly turned to a high point in the afternoon. Although there was a reversal in the trend, the environment did not change. Only No. 16 and De Fu suddenly had a large demand, which led to the rise. However, it did not escape the state of fluctuation. The trend in the morning was flat and weak. Category C retreated to nine yuan, Category A retreated to eight yuan, and Category B once broke the fifty yuan mark, only because the sellers were slightly looser. In the afternoon, buyers suddenly became enthusiastic. No. 16 and De Fu were eagerly sought. Sheng Da, Yong Kang, and Lian He all bought in. The selling pressure was slightly weaker, so the buyers gained the upper hand. Category A and C stocks reappeared at eight and nine yuan, Category B stocks reappeared at the fifty yuan mark, and Category D stocks also broke through eight yuan. As a result, the decline turned into a rise. Various bonds recovered about one or two jiao to half a yuan. The transaction volume was about eight or nine hundred thousand yuan. The details are listed in the following table:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of China Trust Company stock were traded at a price of 9.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The public utility stock market lacked any unique characteristics. The squeezing of short positions at the end of the week was over, and it continued as usual throughout the day. In fact, almost all stocks fell slightly. Jardine Matheson and Shanghai Enterprise Company stocks accounted for the majority of trading this week, so the decline was also the most significant. Wheelock Marden and Shanghai Gas stood out from the crowd, and were particularly strong, with prices soaring. China Land Reclamation also showed a steady trend, with no change in price throughout the day. Rubber stocks shared the same fate as public utility stocks, closing weaker.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Thursday) dispatch: Today's listed prices of Far East companies' stocks were generally stable, with little change in each stock. Only Gula Kelin Rubber stock fell three pence, to eighteen shillings and nine pence.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Thursday) dispatch: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in the bonds of various levels.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial Bank has compiled a table of Chinese securities, which has been published. The table contains hundreds of types of Chinese and Western stocks and bonds, which are detailed and easy to check. Those in need can obtain it from the General Affairs Department of the bank, limited to one copy per person.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Food, Rice Market Initially Rises Then Weakens <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since the rice market experienced a sharp drop the day before yesterday, it rebounded at noon. Yesterday, the sentiment at the opening was still good. Both local and out-of-town merchants were active. Merchants took advantage of this opportunity to steeply increase prices by about half a yuan. In addition, floating speculators were taking advantage of the situation, throwing out goods to reap profits on the one hand, and searching for cheap goods to replenish their stock on the other. The market rose steadily, and the mid-market was even more impressive. Various foreign rice prices all increased by more than one yuan compared with the previous closing price. No. 1 Saigon was sold for 44 yuan, No. 1 for 40 yuan and 4 jiao, special Siam for 42 yuan, No. 2 for 40 yuan, Huojiao for 42.5 yuan, Mindang special for 43 yuan, Xiaojiao for 39.8 yuan, Tokyo polished top grade from 40 yuan and 5 jiao, then to 39 yuan and 6 jiao, milled top grade 42.5 yuan to 42 yuan, No. 1 and 2 mixed broken special 35 yuan, middle 34 yuan, next 32 yuan, Mijiao 37 yuan, next to 26 yuan. However, sales in both wholesale and retail markets were not as active as in the morning. At the close of the market, there was a slight depreciation of 2 or 3 jiao. Although there was a large arrival of glutinous rice, the price was the lowest, and there were more inquiries during this good period, with the price rising by half a yuan. Other national rices such as Baobao are rarely transferred from Hongkou recently, and the prices have approached foreign rice. It is reported that the off-market grey market is quite sluggish, also around one yuan. Kunshan special Japonica rice 47 yuan, city 46 yuan, Qingsi special Baobao 47.5 yuan, 46 yuan, city 45.5 yuan, 45 yuan, Nangang early and late rice 44.5 yuan, 44 yuan. Today, 1,500 bags of rice, 1,800 bags of corn, and 5,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Silk and Tea, Raw Silk Exports Approaching <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign silk prices were stable, and the sentiment in Shanghai was weak. Therefore, the psychology of foreign firms and silk factories was greatly approaching. Transactions were active in firms such as Dachang and Jardine Matheson, selling more than 200 dan. Eight-tenths of white factory silk cost 5,200 yuan, seven-eighths of white factory silk cost 5,050 yuan, and seventy-five percent of white factory silk cost 4,950 yuan. The market for Indian silk still showed no sign of development, because the price of native silk was higher in the inland than in this port.</p>
<p>In the foreign silk market, the Yokohama spot price for March delivery has stopped auctioning, and the April price is 1,624 yuan, up 5 yuan. The New York near-term price fell by one and a half cents, and the far-term price rose by two cents. Spot prices showed no change. Although silk prices are currently stable, most people are generally bearish, so silk trading has been quiet for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Coal, Hongji Small Coal Out of Stock <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Hongji No. 1 small coal has recently been out of stock due to a break in supply. All distribution points have no goods available for the market. Although Hongji Company has inventory, it only sells to old trading customers and does not sell to other merchants, resulting in the grey market price of No. 1 original small coal rising to 175 yuan per ton. There are no large batches of spot goods available. However, No. 2 screened small coal cannot meet the market demand due to its inferior quality and hard price.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Imports and Exports, Tianjin Tobacco Arrives, Bean Cake and Tung Oil <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>On the 29th, tea imports came from Hong Kong, 1,014 pieces. Also, 50 cases of artificial silk from Hong Kong, 100 barrels and 300 cans of tung oil from Tianjin, 100 cans of peanut oil, and 1,000 pieces of soybean cake from Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Yarn and Cotton, Double Horse Yarn Becomes Tighter, South China Demand is Particularly Strong, Sales Rebound by 10 Yuan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned from weak to strong. Although the US exchange rate has lengthened and gold has weakened slightly, sentiment has improved. This is because the demand for Chinese yarn is strong in Chaoshan, Guangdong, and other places in South China. As a result, Double Horse yarn is becoming increasingly tight. However, most of the industry believes that the bottom price has reached a high level, so they are unwilling to buy in, and the intention to sell is strong. Therefore, the price fluctuation range is vast, and the competition between the bulls and bears is fierce. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,016 yuan, and then it rose directly to 1,037 yuan.</p>
<p>News of the morning yarn market opening indicated that the British and American exchange rates had lengthened, the US exchange rate had risen, and gold had fallen, and the selling pressure suddenly increased. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse for April delivery was 1,016 yuan. As soon as this price was opened, the inland merchants bought in as much as possible, and the situation changed immediately. The buying sentiment was strong, and the market rose step by step, closing at 1,037 yuan. Statistics show that the turnover for half a day was 2,637 bales. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 10 yuan. The amount of purchases by various merchants is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Other merchants: 2,307, Hong Kong: 250</p>
<p>Yunnan: 80, Total: 2,637</p>
<p>Cotton trading is still prosperous, and the market situation remains stable.</p>
<p>Cotton trading is slightly less active, but American cotton trading is very strong. Both British and Japanese factories have demand, and inter-merchant buying and selling is also prosperous, but the market situation is still stable. The current cotton trading situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Fire-damaged package 202.50, inter-merchant purchase: 200 pieces</p>
<p>American Te Lin 260.00, also: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Fire-damaged package 205.00, also: 130 pieces</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 196.00, also: 180 bales</p>
<p>American Teling 281.00, Lun Chang purchase: 800 pieces</p>
<p>Fire-damaged package 38.00, Toyota purchase: 550 pieces</p>
<p>Million Cotton 225.00, Chong Xin purchase: 170 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Flower 208.60, inter-merchant purchase: 200 bales</p>
<p>In addition, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was firm at the beginning of yesterday morning, first due to speculation by speculators, then due to purchases in the market on Wall Street, and active short covering. As a result, the closing price rose by five or six pounds compared with the previous day. The Indian market situation was relatively calm. Yesterday's forecasts were not much different. The Egyptian market rose by more than ten pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been quiet in recent days due to the heavy arrival of goods, and various parties are busy collecting funds and settling drafts. Some merchants, seeing the difficulty in raising funds, reluctantly sold at low prices, which was about 30 yuan cheaper than the prices offered by foreign firms. Factory trading has been quiet from beginning to end. The following is the factory price converted at a US exchange rate of 6.125 yuan yesterday:</p>
<p>20-count American Te Lin: 282.90</p>
<p>Also, also, lower grade: 272.50</p>
<p>32-count, also: 298.00</p>
<p>Also, also, lower grade: 288.50</p>
<p>40-count, also: 302.00</p>
<p>Also, also, lower grade: 292.50</p>
<p>Woolen cloth sales are still brisk, but prices have turned up. The general market atmosphere is excellent. At present, most of the woolen fabrics in Shanghai woolen mills have been sold out. New fabric weaving has been mostly suspended due to raw materials and capital constraints. Standard prices have therefore risen sharply. Even those with inventory are preparing for a good sale in the second half of the year. Camel wool scarves and riding breeches are uniformly priced at 30 yuan per yard, Xie Xin riding breeches are 19 yuan, Yin Feng is 18.5 yuan, and Yi He is 19.5 yuan. Light yellow and light green colors are increased by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hardware, Black Steel Billets Sell Actively <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The market for black steel billets has been active recently, with local thermos bottle factories making large purchases. Merchants from Tianjin and Yantai also intend to buy in. In addition, mirror factories, machinery factories, and iron printing factories are also actively absorbing them, so the market is slightly firm. (Because the overseas supply of this product to Shanghai is still uninterrupted, there is no worry about a temporary shortage of goods.) For example, a 200-pound box sells for about 79 yuan to 80 yuan, while a 2,000-pound original bundle is priced at only 810 yuan to 820 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e79">North and South Goods, Preserved Tangerines Are Scarce, Prices Rise Again by 2-3 Yuan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Preserved tangerine arrivals are still scarce, but the products are better than before. The color is very bright red, and the cake is extremely soft and glutinous, so the price has increased. It is reported that a certain firm has opened several dozen barrels, and the price has increased by 2-3 yuan compared with before.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Raw Peanut Prices Plunge <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Qingdao reported that foreign merchants' sales have become sluggish, and prices have suddenly fallen back. 6,000 packages were traded at 32 yuan, a sharp drop of 5-6 yuan. Peanut prices have also weakened. Gaomi raw peanuts were 28 yuan to 30 yuan, with 1,000 yuan traded, also down 2-3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Retrospective of the Woolen Fabric Market Last Year <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Fang</p>
<p>(Continued from the 26th)</p>
<p>The current market is frequently rising, but most of the prices have not risen to the cost price. For example, long-haired camel wool is wholesaled at 23 yuan per yard. Those who settled the previous six-month exchange bill at 25% can earn 800 yuan per box. According to the exchange bill settlement, each box will lose 800 yuan per box. The difference in and out of the exchange rate for a box of goods is as high as 1,600 yuan, which shows the relationship between foreign exchange fluctuations and the life of the woolen wool industry. In late autumn, the wool market became more and more brisk, because the weather was cool, and transactions were actively taking place. Both actual sales and the sale of distressed goods were extremely hot. The market on the public tea house changed in an instant, with prices jumping three or four times a day. Because the European war had broken out, the supply was limited, and it was expected that it would be difficult to obtain a fixed supply in the future, so all those with inventory on hand were hoarding and arbitrarily raising prices. The general delivery merchants all held the door market's sample business, no longer calling for the street to solicit business, and the business of brokers, except for those with financial resources and courage, eating goods themselves and using the means of control, could make a lot of money, were all more difficult than in previous years.</p>
<p>The market was even better in October, because the weather was getting colder and the sales of various men's suits were extremely wide. The shop door merchants of woolen fabric clothing stores in this street, both old and new, shoe markets, and hat factories all had smooth sales. However, customer merchants (1) had transportation difficulties, and (2) most of the wool weaving materials were designated as luxury goods by the government, so there were very few who transported and sold them to the mainland. However, the procurement of guerrilla areas such as Tianjin, Hankou, and Nanjing was extremely active. At the end of the month, the price of the border goods was even higher than at the beginning of the month. Various thick and thin woolen fabrics, whether woven from wool, cotton, silk, or ramie, imported goods or local factory goods woven in Shanghai, all rose steadily, like flying a kite, higher and higher. The main reasons are: first, the shortening of exchange bills increased costs and raw materials rose sharply, and various prices rose sharply and expenses were huge; second, the European war was difficult to fix and the market sales were smooth, and the recent price increase of 2 cents, the customs duty was forced to use "Hua Xing" banknotes, which invisibly increased by 40%. Woolen fabrics with Western characters are still popular and sell well. Western clothing stores on Xiafei Road, Sichuan Road, Daxin Street, and Jing'an Temple mostly display them in the glass windows of the front door as a sign of honor. Cabbage green and light green patterned fabrics are still very popular and show off, and demand exceeds supply. Overcoat fabrics have shifted to light gray as the trend. In mid-winter, due to difficulty in fixing deliveries, and the lack of Shanghai inventory, all goods are in short supply. Sellers with inventory, whether retail or wholesale, are all hoarding and arbitrarily raising prices. General wholesalers are overjoyed. The prices of domestic woolen fabrics and serge have risen sharply, because the raw materials are scarce and difficult to transport. The price increase of overcoat fabrics and thick fabrics is also not light. Camel wool scarves (also known as cloth covers) are more popular than riding breeches. The prices of all colors are the same, unlike last year, when the price difference between colors was as high as one yuan. Woolen fabrics that were previously loaded on German ships and stranded in Japan have now been transported one after another by ships from neutral countries, and the number is not small. Woolen fabrics arriving in Shanghai have decreased by two-thirds compared with before, because the Japanese government ordered that woolen fabrics must be mixed with artificial wool and cotton, resulting in a sharp reduction in demand, and also because of foreign exchange purchases, they cannot be directly shipped to Shanghai without first being transferred to Hong Kong. Shanghai-made woven woolen fabrics have been greatly sold as a result of good opportunities. Japanese businessmen operating in the business also have the Jia Gong Da Yarn Factory weaving woolen fabrics, and Chinese businessmen also have Run Feng, Da Hua, and De Da, etc. Those who specialize in linings, such as Zi cloth, have Yin Feng, Xin Ji, Zheng Lun, and Bao Kang, etc., which can also be seen as flourishing. The market in the last quarter of the year has always risen without falling, because the shortage of goods is abnormal, and the industry is very optimistic. Also, because the scheduled deliveries are completely absent, many have purchased spring and summer spot goods, so the spring and winter woolen fabric deliveries have a great business. But in fact, all goods are in short supply, and prices are high. At the public tea house, only the sound of wanting to buy in is heard, and rarely is the sound of wanting to sell out heard. The samples produced by the distributors have been raised one after another on a temporary basis, and most of them have been recalled early, which can also be seen as the lack of precious woolen fabrics. The standard is chaotic, 70-80% of it is controlled by large wholesalers, and the market is high, allowing those who hoard goods to shout wildly. All transactions are mostly settled by the buyer following the seller. Looking at the market conditions in the four seasons, the prices have risen every day, especially in the winter. The profits of all sizes of shops are all more than those in 1927. (End)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and other organizations all issued statements yesterday. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Party Department's Letter to the Public</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a letter to the public, saying: Compatriots, we should understand that the Japanese invasion of China is approaching total collapse. There is no way to pull out the muddy feet in military affairs. When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, they have to launch a political offensive again, instigating pseudo-organizations, using Wang Kemin, Liang Hongzhi, and even Wang Jingwei, in an attempt to save their final fate. In fact, this strategy still cannot affect our national policy of resistance and reconstruction in the slightest. Now our front-line battles are reporting victories frequently. We firmly believe that our leader has clearly told us that the final victory is 100% sure to come soon. Military experts around the world have also confirmed that the final victory will belong to China. The Japanese domestic situation is in extreme panic. Only those who are blinded by greed and suffering from a very heavy fear of Japan, cannot see the dawn of victory, and still sell themselves to rely on, which has to be said to be a great shame for the Chinese nation. We must wash away this shame. We must strive for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. We must exert the power of 450 million citizens. We must support the leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to complete the great mission of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<p>Youth League's Campaign of Condemnation</p>
<p>Chongqing, 19th dispatch, the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League sent a telegram to the whole country, stating that Wang Jinwei recently concluded a secret agreement with the Japanese and organized a puppet government. All members of this branch, driven by hot blood, are unwilling to sit idly by, and will lead the youth of Shanghai to expand the campaign of condemnation, in order to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Various Organizations Clarify Their Positions</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Kuomintang Zhongyi Comrades Alliance, the All-Circles Federation, the All-Circles Integrity Movement Committee, and other organizations in this city, all issued statements yesterday, urging the public to strengthen their will and complete the great cause of resistance and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Next Flag Hanging on May 5th</p>
<p>According to the flag hanging method agreed upon by the two Chinese Taxpayers Associations and the authorities of the two concessions, after March 29th, the flag should be hung again to celebrate the anniversary of the inauguration of the Extraordinary President on May 5th. Also, since the spring of the 28th year, the Chinese Taxpayers Association has not issued a notice instructing the citizens to hang flags after publicly announcing the detailed hanging of flags for eight days throughout the year in accordance with the agreed method.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Two Concessions Under Special Curfew Starting This Morning <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Starting at zero o'clock this morning, the authorities of the two concessions declared a special curfew. At the intersection of Rue Eduard VII and Avenue Foch, which is the boundary between the Public Concession and the French Concession, following past practices, all unimportant roads running north-south will be blocked with wire mesh, cutting off traffic. Only the Bund, Sichuan Road, Sam Ye Ge Bridge, Zheng Jia Mu Bridge, Dong Xin Bridge, Great World, Chengdu Road, Tong Fu Road and other intersections can pass north and south. The number of guards has been increased, and pedestrians and vehicles are strictly checked. The border areas between the two concessions and the outer areas are also stepping up defenses. Police personnel from the two concessions and troops stationed in various countries have been dispatched to maintain order.</p>
<h3 id="e84">British Troops in Xinjiang Road Defense Zone Raise Iron Netting Higher, Citizens Outside the Boundary Near North Xizang Road Are Uneasy <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Since the Xin Zha Branch of the Zhabei Branch (formerly the Fourth District) was hit by the troops, all the municipal housing, except for the section from the north side of the Xin Zha Bridge, Guangfu Road, and Chang'an Road facing west, to the Huasheng Road intersection, still has dozens of low-rise tile bungalows. The hundreds of houses in Xinjiang Road De Xing Lane, Tian Xin Lane, Tian Bao Lane, Sheng Chang Lane, Nan Lin Lane, Hua Xing Road, Hua Xing Fang, etc., are inhabited by poor citizens. Because the rents and prices in the concessions are too expensive, they have all moved back one after another in recent times, but they spend every day in painful conditions. However, the roads there are adjacent to the concessions and are British troop defense zones. In recent days, there have been more than a dozen British soldiers (i.e. Scottish soldiers) who have thickened the original barbed wire and raised it by five or six feet. Yesterday morning, even though there were continuous rain, the work did not stop. It has now been added from the intersection of Hainin Road and Gansu Road to Rehe Road, nearly to the intersection of North Xizang Road.</p>
<h3 id="e85">All Sectors Lowered Flags Yesterday to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs, Inheriting Their Will, Emulating Revolutionary Spirit, Supporting National Policy, and Completing the Great Cause of Resistance and National Reconstruction <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, also known as Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. The Central Government also stipulated that the commemoration of the martyrdom of Deng Zhongxia, Chen Ying Shi, Liao Zhongkai, and Zhu Zhixin, as well as the death anniversaries of Huang Keqiang and Hu Zhangtang, should be held together. All sectors of the city lowered their flags and suspended entertainment banquets in solemn remembrance, in order to express their admiration for the heroic sacrifices and great achievements of the martyrs. Schools, public organizations, courts, the Jianghai Customs, and other institutions all took holidays as usual. All sectors recognized that the true meaning of commemorating the revolutionary martyrs lay in emulating their revolutionary spirit and inheriting their unfinished aspirations. Therefore, they unanimously and resolutely supported the national policy and completed the resistance and national reconstruction, in order to carry forward the foundation left by the martyrs. All sectors continued to promote the austerity and relief movement to benefit the refugees. The authorities of the two concessions implemented strict security measures yesterday, increasing the number of plainclothes and uniformed police patrols. Any suspicious pedestrians and vehicles were inspected to prevent bad elements from disrupting public order.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Japanese Side Plots Again to Interfere with Cotton Yarn Procurement and Sales, Unification Policy Repeatedly Fails, Headed Down Wrong Path Without Realization <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese side unified various goods and monopolized the market in the occupied areas and the suburbs of Shanghai, they are currently implementing the following: the "Fuli Company" unified the tea in Dinghai, the "Central China Company" unified the silk and silkworms in the occupied areas, and the recently opened "Central Market" unified the vegetables from the suburbs to Shanghai. All of them have failed. Now the Japanese side has an organization called the "Textile Co., Ltd." in the works, hoping to once again unify the purchase and sale of cotton yarn from Chinese-owned yarn mills. It is said that this organization is in the works and will be formally established in the middle of next month. Before the war, there were about 40 Chinese-owned yarn mills operating in Shanghai. Some of the factories were destroyed by artillery fire during the war because they were located in Zhabei and Yangshupu. Since the National Government worked hard to develop the southwest and northwest, the factories operated by Chinese have gradually moved to the mainland to continue production in order to meet needs and consolidate the financial foundation during the war. Therefore, there are currently about 20 Chinese-owned yarn mills that have resumed operations in Shanghai. In peacetime, Nantong was the largest supplier of raw cotton, supplemented by products from Zhengzhou, Shaanxi, and other places. The cotton from Tongzhou is soft and has long fibers, comparable to American cotton. It is suitable for spinning finer counts of yarn. Orders from abroad are mostly for American, Indian, and Egyptian cotton. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the raw materials shipped to China from the occupied and unoccupied areas have been difficult after the outbreak of the war, but they can still come in without being unified. The power to import foreign cotton to Shanghai is controlled by foreign merchants, which is beyond the power of the Japanese side.</p>

<p>The English-language Dama Evening News said that the Shanghai Women's Organizations Joint Committee will start the second "Clean to Maintain Health" campaign from May 1st, advocating mosquito control to prevent malaria and other infectious diseases, ending on May 8th. The Health Department and Education Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession are cooperating with the committee and will hold a student essay contest, using posters and leaflets to persuade citizens to remove stagnant water and filth. Various women's organizations and other organizations and individuals organizing the committee have provided assistance to this movement. Those who want to donate to add posters and leaflets can contact Mrs. Lesay at 15 Avenue Petain or Mrs. Colt at the British Women's Federation at 12 The Bund.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Japanese Side's "Return" of Concessions Statement, Various Countries Do Not Pay Attention, French Newspaper Strongly Refutes Mutō's Talk, Contact Should Be Made With Legal Government <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Mutō, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, made some remarks regarding the status of foreign concessions in China. At that time, Mutō claimed that the Japanese government had repeatedly announced that the establishment of a "new order" was in progress. Japan would consider returning the Japanese concessions in China. Once the "new East Asian situation" was completed, Japan should take the necessary actions. If third countries do not act consistently, China and Japan should do their best to recover the foreign concessions in China and take appropriate measures as needed. The French-language Shanghai Daily commented on this matter yesterday, saying that the countries that have concessions in China have never recognized that the concessions are a permanent system. Each country believes that the concessions can be returned at an appropriate time, but should be returned to the legal government recognized by each country. The newspaper also said that in our observation, Japan is one of the foreign governments in China, and it is known that it has no right to speak on behalf of the Chinese people. Therefore, on the third country side, it should not pay attention to the Japanese talk of recovering the concessions. In the future, even if the concession issue is raised, various countries should negotiate with the Chinese legal government that it has officially recognized, and there is no need for the Japanese to do it on their behalf, and there is no room for the Japanese side to intervene. General Mutō can rest, why so much tongue-wagging?</p>
<h3 id="e89">Foreign Trade with China in January and February: Japan Takes the Lead, All Countries Affected <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Customs has released figures for foreign trade with China from January to February this year. American ships numbered 34, totaling 162,153 tons; British ships numbered 301, totaling 759,451 tons; Japanese ships numbered 20, totaling 75,251 tons; French ships numbered 18, totaling 113,872 tons; Greek ships numbered 7, totaling 13,717 tons; Italian ships numbered 12, totaling 76,636 tons; Japanese ships numbered 1,343, totaling 1,890,686 tons; and Chinese ships (presumably smaller) numbered 30 pairs, totaling 143,125 tons; Norwegian ships numbered 78, totaling 171,234 tons; Panamanian ships numbered 14, totaling 29,656 tons; Portuguese ships numbered 85, totaling 8,652 tons; Swedish ships numbered 3, totaling 7,816 tons; ships from other countries numbered 70, totaling 40,255 tons; Chinese ships numbered 190, totaling 107,700 tons; and privately owned Chinese ships numbered 13,844, totaling 246,529 tons. Due to special circumstances, Japan has risen to the top in foreign trade with China, while other countries have been affected by Japanese obstruction, resulting in unusual declines.</p>

<p>The Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council announces that, as spring arrives and infectious diseases tend to spread, the following four public health regulations are hereby enacted to protect the health of the public and residents within the Settlement. Please take note: (1) Vaccinations and cholera inoculations are free. Vaccinations and inoculations are available at all health sub-stations and in mobile vaccination vehicles. (2) If there are any unsanitary conditions in your residence, please report them to the nearest health sub-station. Inspectors will be sent to help. (3) Houses that have been affected by infectious diseases can be disinfected free of charge by the nearest health sub-station. The Isolation Hospital at 96 Haining Road provides free care for people with dangerous infectious diseases. However, there will be a charge for special rooms and medications.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council announce that, as the weather warms and summer approaches, the operating hours of all public and private vegetable markets will be slightly advanced in the interest of hygiene. From April 1st to October 30th, stalls must close before 10:00 AM daily so that cleaners can clear away garbage early. An announcement has already been issued.</p>

<h3 id="e92">French Concession Price Stabilization Committee Diligently Investigating, Drafting Detailed Price Control Regulations, and Enforcing Them Strictly, Committee Members Wasting No Time <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *North China Daily News* reports that the promulgation of price control regulations by the French Concession's Price Stabilization Committee has been delayed for some time. When a reporter inquired with French Consul-General Eugene, he replied that no committee member was wasting time. The entire matter was very complex, and the committee was working closely with the Shanghai Municipal Council subcommittee. Although the work was slow, it needed to be effective. Price control regulations were still being drafted and would be strictly enforced as soon as they were finalized. The Price Stabilization Committee had held many meetings to discuss these regulations. It was necessary to understand the economic situation in Shanghai before deciding on price control regulations. Any steps we take must be practical and necessary. We do not want to implement regulations that require subsequent amendment. To achieve this goal, the Price Stabilization Committee is proceeding cautiously and discussing everything with the Shanghai Municipal Council subcommittee, which takes time. Although it may seem delayed on the surface, it is not because the Price Stabilization Committee is not working. It is simply because a great deal of time has been spent on this work. After the Price Stabilization Committee was established, the French Concession Police Department immediately took on the task of investigating the essential commodities available within the Concession. Basic commodity prices had already been determined and reported to the Price Stabilization Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e93">No Progress in Fact After Establishment of Police Agreement, Special Police Force Still Far from Being Established, No Sign of Returning Hongkou Police Authority <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of road extensions outside the boundary of the Shanghai Western District, the Shanghai Municipal Council signed a temporary police agreement with the so-called "Municipal Government" on February 16, deciding to establish a jointly operated special police force on the extended roads. Regarding the issue of returning police authority in Hongkou, the Shanghai Municipal Council signed the Suzhou Creek North District police agreement with Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Miura Yoshiaki on March 1, deciding to establish a new "E" District police district in Hongkou. At the same time, the Japanese side would return all police authority in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas to the Shanghai Municipal Council. To date, there has been no progress in fact. The special police force in the Shanghai Western District has not been established, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet resumed full police authority in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas.</p>
<p>When a reporter inquired with Police Commissioner Major F.W. Gerrard yesterday, it was learned that no committee meeting had been held to discuss the establishment of the "E" District police district, and even the committee members had not been appointed. The Police Department's resumption of full authority to exercise its functions north of Suzhou Creek would not occur until after the "E" District police district was established. At the same time, the conference on preparations for the new police force on the extended roads outside the boundary of the Shanghai Western District had been delayed for a long time and was still far from being established. In that area, bandits were rampant, and cases of robbery and theft were constantly occurring, which urgently needed to be addressed. According to yesterday's Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette, a section regarding the future of the area north of Suzhou Creek stated that, on December 10, 1938, Mr. Hidaka wrote to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council stating that the Japanese authorities would continue to lift restrictions in that area as much as possible. The Council sincerely hoped that the attitude expressed in his communication would be reciprocated and that all restrictions would be lifted as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Coal Inventory Growing Daily <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>370,000 Tons Shipped to Shanghai in Two Months, Valued at Over 7 Million National Currency</p>
<p>Anthracite coal is continuously shipped into Shanghai from Japan, and inventories are growing daily. Transactions are also being concluded via telegram, so the spot market supply is increasing. Major dealers are releasing coal to the market, but prices have not fallen. It is assured that there will be no shortage of coal and fuel in Shanghai. The authorities have already formulated concrete measures to urge coal merchants to sell coal at fair prices so that speculators cannot manipulate the market and prices will fall. From January to February this year, a total of 376,129 tons of coal were shipped from overseas, valued at 7,264,043 national currency. In February, 174,277 tons were shipped, valued at 3,817,647 national currency (1,410,287 in gold). The largest amount came from Annam, totaling 104,779 tons, valued at 787,300 in gold. British India was second, totaling 43,928 tons, valued at 531,839 in gold. Japan was third, totaling 13,289 tons, valued at 49,818 in gold. However, Japanese coal is of lower quality, so customers are extremely rare. There is no concern that the supply of firewood and charcoal fuel will be interrupted. If the direct shipping of Ningbo freighters is realized, a large amount of Wenzhou and Taizhou firewood and charcoal will be shipped, and the price of firewood and charcoal will plummet at that time.</p>

<p>Remarkable Achievement</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Women and Children's Hospital is the only free maternity hospital in Shanghai, greatly benefiting the poor. Since the hospital launched this fundraising campaign, it has received enthusiastic support from Chinese and foreigners. In less than ten days, a considerable amount has been raised.

It is heard that the purpose of this fundraising campaign is to raise 50,000 yuan for annual expenses and future expansion. The hospital is jointly operated by Chinese and foreign charitable organizations. For over a year, it has been providing services to poor Chinese women, with remarkable results. It is sincerely hoped that all sectors will generously provide financial assistance to promote this good cause. Donations, no matter the amount, should be sent to Mr. Yu Zhongkui, Honorary Accountant of the Hospital, Room 512, 113 Jiujiang Road.</p>

<p>The dredging of the Huangpu River was halted after the Shanghai Incident and has been suspended for nearly three years. Silt near Jiaozui Island (Dinghai Island) has gradually accumulated, affecting navigation. Ships are anchored outside the Huangpu River, and both sides of the streets in the settlements are flooded during every rain. It is learned that the dredging work will be started by a small dredger within two weeks. China's largest dredger, the "Jianshe," is unlikely to participate in this work. It will undertake the dredging work when the weather is dry. Another dredger, a sister ship of the "Jianshe," is currently stranded in Danze. It is learned that it will not be transported to Shanghai until after the end of the European war.</p>

<p>Deficit: 590,509 yuan</p>
<p>Total deficit for the above two items: 5,573,280 yuan</p>
<p>(B) Current Revenue</p>
<p>The Board of Directors recently resolved to add a surcharge of 50% to the general rate, land tax, special house rate, and special advertising tax from July 1st of last year. In addition, the surcharge on all license fees and vegetable market stall fees will be increased from 10% to 50%. Therefore, the current revenue budget includes the amount of these additional charges.</p>
<p>The total revenue is estimated to be around 41,861,750 yuan, an increase of 13,656,480 yuan over last year, of which land tax accounts for 11,488,750 yuan, general rate accounts for 17,721,250 yuan, special house rate accounts for 1,150,000 yuan, and revenue from public and municipal utilities accounts for 5,470,500 yuan. License fees account for 4,603,700 yuan, rental income from Council-owned properties accounts for 936,300 yuan, and wharfage dues account for 400,000 yuan. The revenue from various items with additional surcharges is listed below:</p>
<p>The above revenue estimates are based on relevant facts. If there are no unexpected changes during the year, they should be achieved. The tax collection measures implemented in the eastern district last winter were successful and will be continued this year.</p>
<p>Revenue from public and municipal utilities totals 5,470,500 yuan, an increase of 2,632,000 yuan over last year, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Dividends from the Shanghai Waterworks Company 70,000 yuan, (2) Revenue from Council-operated industries 65,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Current Expenditure</p>
<p>The drastic decline in exchange rates and the sharp rise in prices of various goods and materials have had a significant impact, especially on the payment of retirement savings and pensions in the general expenditure category. Due to the high cost of living, Council employees must be given higher allowances to show consideration. In addition, the salaries of employees who should be promoted according to their grade will also be increased accordingly. However, Western employees whose home countries are involved in the European war will not be granted long leave this year, which will save a considerable amount on long leave exchange allowances and travel expenses.</p>
<p>Interest and commissions, etc. This expenditure includes the interest payable on municipal bonds and temporary loans, totaling 2,987,360 yuan this year, an increase of 753,780 yuan over last year.</p>
<p>Principal repayment of bonds. The provision for principal repayment of bonds this year totals 1,446,390 yuan, an increase of 1,154,320 yuan over last year.</p>
<p>Repayment of 6% New Bonds. It is planned to issue 12 million yuan in new bonds this year, with a term of ten years. Principal will be repaid every six months starting from July next year. The amount payable for the first period from May to December this year, totaling 800,000 yuan, has now been included.</p>
<p>General Expenditure. This type of expenditure is divided into the following four items, totaling 8,000,570 yuan this year, an increase of 5,304,920 yuan over last year.</p>

<p>Three bloody incidents occurred within two hours on the morning of the day before yesterday. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is learned that Xue Xianyang (38 years old) from Wusong, who was ambushed near the Baizhongmen Hotel on Yuyuan Road in the Shanghai Western District, died of excessive bleeding from a bullet wound to the chest that damaged his lungs. Although he was treated by a Japanese doctor at the Fumin Hospital, it was ineffective. He died at 1:30 AM yesterday. Xue's body has been claimed by his wife, Shi. Xu Shen, who was shot on Donghan Bili Road, reportedly suffered a wound to his left waist. The bullet penetrated his left lower abdomen, and he is now in a coma. It is also heard that Xu lives at 25 Chunyang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. He was attacked when he was leaving home. Ma Shaoquan, a native of Wuxi, who was attacked at the entrance of Xicun Lane, Fuli Road, in the French Concession, did not experience any changes in his condition yesterday, and the injuries were not critical. Therefore, after treatment, his condition is very good, and there is no danger to his life. However, Ma's bodyguard, Xu Bingfa, is still in critical condition.</p>

<p>Chen Quan, a well-known local antique dealer, lives with his wife and children at 12 Molie Road in the French Concession. His second son, Chen Yuanliang, also known as Chen Zonghui, married Yin Junong in 1935. However, Chen Yuanliang did not engage in proper work, and his dissolute behavior worsened his relationship with his wife. In recent years, he became involved with dance halls and neglected his wife. Recently, he lived with the dance girl Xu Xueli (also known as Zhou Lianfang) at 593 Laodeste Road, second floor, where they lived together as husband and wife. This was discovered by his wife, Yin, who reported it to the French police at 5:00 AM yesterday. The police went to the residence to arrest the adulterers and caught them in the act. They were taken to the police station and then sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation at 2:00 PM. After questioning, Judge Zhu ordered them to be released on bail of 3,000 yuan and postponed the hearing to April 5. Yin Junong, 26 years old this year, is the younger sister of Yin Zhenyi, a famous local doctor, and the daughter of the late famous doctor Yin Shoutian, who specialized in pediatrics. She is an only daughter and is dearly loved by her parents.</p>
<p>Fond of Kunqu Opera</p>
<p>With the stage name of Leng Guan, she was introduced to Chen Zongyao, a young man from Nanjing (24 years old this year, working as ) by the late famous doctor Xia Yingtang and Xie Zenghe in Japan. They were married at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road in January 1935. Their love was deep, and they already have two children. Chen's residence was originally in a Western-style house at 60 Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai Western District, which was self-owned property and part of a large family. The house is now used as an office by the Wang Jingwei faction. Therefore, the Chen family</p>
<p>Was Scattered</p>
<p>And moved to the concessions. However, the relationship between Chen Zongyao and Yin Junong has recently broken down, becoming as incompatible as fire and water. Yin returned to Ningbo and has been living with her mother in the Cangzhou Hotel on Xiejiao Road, Jing'an Temple. Chen Zongyao rented a Western-style house at 593 Lafei Road and repeatedly invited Yin back home to live with him, but she refused, causing the resentment between the two parties to deepen. Yin Junong suddenly reported to the French police at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday that her husband, Chen Zongyao, had recently been</p>
<p>Having an Affair with a Woman from Taizhou</p>
<p>Zhou Lianfang (19 years old this year) and had taken her to live with him at 593 Lafei Road, committing adultery. She requested an investigation. A police officer was dispatched along with detectives. When they arrived, Chen was sleeping in the bathroom, and Zhou was sleeping in the room with Chen's mother. They were all taken to the police station for investigation. In the afternoon, they were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Weishen presided over the hearing. The defendants hired lawyers Le Jun and Zhang Zhengxue to appear in court for defense. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, prosecuting them for</p>
<p>Disrupting the Family</p>
<p>Under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Then, the plaintiff, Yin Junong, recounted the discovery and arrest of the defendants for adultery. When questioned, Chen Zongyao denied having an affair with Zhou. Zhou Lianfang also denied having an affair with Chen, stating that she had recognized Chen's mother as her adoptive mother and had gone to visit her yesterday. Chen's mother was not feeling well, so Chen's mother asked her to stay overnight, which led to the false accusation. The court questioned the investigating detectives and then heard the opinions of the defense lawyers, who presented letters to refute the charges. The court ordered the hearing to be postponed to April 5.</p>

<p>De Gui, a barber from Yangzhou, 25 years old, who worked at the Lin Fuji Barber Shop at 355 Beile Road, started a dice game at 12:30 AM yesterday, while his fellow workers were still awake. As a result, he had an argument with Zhou Xiaomao, an apprentice at the shop, over a one-corner wager. The argument escalated into a fight. Zhou, young and ignorant, disregarded the consequences and stabbed De Gui with barber scissors, causing six scissor wounds to De Gui's sides and lower back. De Gui fell to the ground in pain. His fellow workers, seeing the bloody incident, restrained Zhou and called the police. De Gui was rushed to the hospital by ambulance, and Zhou was taken to the police station. However, because the wounds were in vital areas, the treatment was ineffective, and De Gui died of his injuries at around 2:00 AM yesterday. The police will transfer the suspect, Zhou Xiaomao, to the court today for investigation.</p>

<p>The son of Chen Bingxing, a lawyer, and Chen Maoxuan, a detective in the Public Concession Police Department, is Chen Yunzhong. Recently, a rift has suddenly appeared in the family. Chen Fengshi, Chen Yunzhong's wife, and Li Wenyin, Chen Bingxing's wife, have a deep dislike for each other. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law even became involved in litigation in the public court. Chen Fengshi, represented by her second son, Chen Maoxuan, and lawyer Wang Shouan, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court accusing Chen Li Wenyin of public insult. The court has already concluded the trial. Yesterday afternoon, the presiding judge announced the verdict, sentencing Chen Li Wenyin to a fine of five yuan for public insult. If she is unable to pay the fine, she will be sentenced to one day of labor for each yuan.</p>

<p>Since the Ningbo Shipping Administration has stipulated regulations for the operation of ferries between Ningbo and Zhenhai, it has paid the most attention to the item of limiting the number of passengers.

<p>Li Caigen from Zhenhai came to Shanghai last year to make a living and now lives at 53 Yongren Lane, Dalianwan Road. He has a wife and two children. On the morning of the 7th of this month, his wife went out to buy groceries. At the intersection of Dalianwan Road and Pingliang Road, she was suddenly hit by truck No. 16918, and her right hand and left foot were crushed. She was sent to Datong Hospital for treatment by the police. Although her life is not in danger, she has become disabled. Since this incident occurred, Caigen has been unable to work, and the family is poor. The two children at home are crying for food. Moreover, the injured woman is pregnant and about to give birth. She is in unspeakable pain from this accident. The truck owner has completely ignored her and is indifferent. The police have also not investigated the accident or provided relief. Caigen sent a letter yesterday to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, asking them to investigate the truck owner through the police and ensure that the truck owner is brought to justice and compensates for the losses and medical expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Suzhou Road Fire the Previous Night - Losses Reaching One Million Yuan - Firefighters Bravely Fighting the Blaze - Walls Collapsing with Terrifying Sounds <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports: At 9:30 PM on the 27th, a fire suddenly broke out at warehouse number 796 on Suzhou Road. It contained a large quantity of raw cotton and silk cocoons, some of which were already destroyed. It was previously reported that the warehouse belonged to Jardine Matheson, but according to Jardine Matheson's statement, the warehouse is the property of the Bank of China and leased to Jardine Matheson. The goods stored inside all belong to various Chinese merchants. As of yesterday (the 28th) evening, some parts of the warehouse were still burning. It is estimated that these remaining embers, blocked by rubble and inaccessible to water, will</p>
<p>continue to burn for several days</p>
<p>before being extinguished. Yesterday, firefighters were still on-site, drawing water to pour onto the smoldering silk, wood, and raw cotton beneath the rubble, and knocking down dangerous walls. The upper floors and roof of the warehouse were completely destroyed, and the rear wall was</p>
<p>damaged. Total losses are estimated at six hundred thousand to one million yuan, but the exact value of the lost goods will not be known for several</p>
<p>months. It is reported that most of the goods stored on the second floor of the warehouse were salvaged and undamaged, while</p>
<p>the ground floor only suffered water damage.</p>
<p>The owners of the goods will soon prepare a list of their goods for investigation. According to the Fire Department, firefighters arrived at the scene shortly after 9:30 PM on the 27th. Due to the burning cotton and billowing thick smoke, firefighters wearing gas masks rushed into the building to pour water on the heart of the fire. Several fire trucks were parked behind the warehouse. The commander, seeing the rear wall swaying dangerously, urgently ordered the trucks to move away and the firefighters inside to evacuate. But before the firefighters could leave the building, the rear wall</p>
<p>collapsed,</p>
<p>the sound of it crashing was terrifying.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one nearby was crushed under the wall. Shortly after all the firefighters had exited the building, the first floor immediately collapsed. Subsequently, water was poured inside through the windows. By 2:30 AM, the fire had passed the critical point, and a few firefighters were left on site to monitor and continue to pour water on the unextinguished areas, up to this moment.</p>

<p>Dazhong News Agency reports: According to reliable sources, a case of international fighting occurred late at night on the 28th of this month inside the Huile Palace gambling den on Daxi Road. It is said that on that night, a Dutch couple, a Danish couple, and an Irish couple were gambling. Late that night, as these three couples of different nationalities were about to leave after gambling, they suddenly encountered a group of drunk men of a certain nationality who forcibly grabbed the hands of their wives, attempting indecent assault. The Dutch man, seeing this, became enraged, but faced with being outnumbered, he ran to the nearby fake "police station." There, an "officer" who could speak English repeatedly thanked him, but said he could not help. The Dutch man, helpless, ran back to the Huile Palace, where the three couples found themselves surrounded by an officer and his thirty or so Chinese assistants, who were very aggressive. In self-defense, the Dutch man took the initiative and struck down a Japanese man with his cane, and thus the fight formally began. A person of a certain nationality immediately took out a pistol and fired, but the Dutch man, quick-witted, knocked the pistol out of his hand with his cane. The brawl lasted for an hour and a half before ending. According to eyewitnesses, the three wives fought bravely during the brawl, and there were no seriously fatal injuries.</p>

<p>Fang Ruiying (also known as Xiuying, age 19, a student at Qunhua School, residing at 116 Xujiahui Road), the younger sister of Sun Guisheng, a shareholder of Continental Powder Store, Tongtaichang, and Laofang Teahouse, among others, who is from Huangyan, Zhejiang, went to Hongxiang Clothing Company on Nanjing Road with her classmate Yang Caizhen on the afternoon of December 14th last year to select a coat. On that day, Miss Fang was wearing a plain student uniform, which led the store clerks to look down on her. While Miss Fang was making her selection, they accused her of attempting to steal a coat worth several hundred yuan, reported her to the police, and had her arrested and sent to the Special First Court, which sentenced her to four months in prison. Later, the Taizhou Association in Shanghai hired lawyer Xu Wufang as a legal advisor to file an appeal to the High Second Branch Court on Miss Fang's behalf, presenting various pieces of evidence to prove that she had indeed been falsely accused. The High Court ultimately declared Miss Fang not guilty. After Miss Fang was declared not guilty, the Special First Court's Prosecutor's Office deemed that Zhuang Zhengchang and Shen Shengyu, the Hongxiang Clothing Company employees, were indeed suspected of false accusation. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru opened a first criminal court yesterday to investigate. Zhuang and Shen were summoned to appear in court. After a detailed interrogation by Prosecutor Zhang, Zhuang Zhengchang and Shen Shengyu were released on bail to await further investigation.</p>

The flames engulfed the entire boat, and as the mooring ropes had been released, it drifted downstream with the tide. The sky was lit up by the flames. People on the Bund</p>
<p>suddenly heard the explosion and were quite alarmed, thinking it was a bomb and scrambling to take cover. The ships in the Huangpu River then sounded</p>
<p>their sirens, and the Puji fireboat immediately sailed to the burning boat to pour water on it. British and Chinese gunboats in the Huangpu River also turned on searchlights to assist. The fire was extinguished in about five minutes. The five crew members of the motorboat intended to moor the boat in front of Zhoujiazui, but it soon sank. All five crew members were rescued, with only one slightly burned. The ambulance from the Fire Brigade rushed him to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>(From this newspaper in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Officials (2)</p>
<p>How can it be said that people scheme for themselves? When a mediocre ruler is in power, the ministers seize control. The mediocre ruler gives the great authority to his subjects and it's misused, and the ministers sell official positions for their own gain. Even if they don't sell them, many are given ranks in public court, and thanks are given in private chambers, so the subjects are all planting parties and marketing favors. For example, Liu Xin and Yang Xiong of the Western Han Dynasty were talented people, but they were willing to be followers of Wang Mang, disgracing their names after death. Cui Lie of the Eastern Han Dynasty paid 100,000 cash to become Minister of Works, and people called him "the copper-smelling Minister". As for other generals and colonels, there's no need to mention them. During the Five Dynasties period, there were many people who knew how to seek wealth and forget their families. Later, there were even those who recognized people as their fathers and offered the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun to seek appointment as emperor. It is even less worth mentioning that petty people buy and sell official positions. Furthermore, with the addition of Wu Sansi, Tian Lingzi, Qin Hui, and Jia Sidao, almost all court officials came from their factions. How could the Tang and Song dynasties not perish! It is difficult to describe the disorder of the Yuan Dynasty in words. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, the politics were still admirable, but Wang Zhen's interference opened the way for eunuchs to seize power. By the time of the Tianqi Emperor, Wei Zhongxian had half of the court officials as his adopted sons, and bandits rose up everywhere, making the Ming Dynasty beyond salvation. Moreover, Emperor Zhuanglie inherited the throne with stubbornness, how could the Ming Dynasty's society not collapse. Official positions are originally established by the court to await virtuous talents and to govern the people, but how can they be allowed to be bought and sold by the subjects? By the time they are all bought and sold, the affairs of the time are beyond hope. It is difficult to investigate matters of the distant past, but the events of the Ming Dynasty are still before us. It is said that Wei Zhongxian's adopted sons paid silver to get positions, and those who still had a conscience were afraid of being known, while those who had lost their conscience were afraid of not being known, so they had their parties publicize it, showing off their ability to manipulate things. With the affairs of the Ming Dynasty like this, what were they waiting for to perish!</p>

<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>The meaning and value of an individual's life are entirely based on the extent of their understanding of thought. In psychology, thought occupies the highest level of all conscious activity, being a systematic union of correct ideas. Humans possess the most complete nervous system, thus transcending ordinary higher animals. In order to achieve the goal of perpetual survival and continuous development, one cannot but utilize thought to control the natural and social environment.</p>
<p>To enhance the meaning of life and solve the many difficulties that arise in daily life, we must train our minds to achieve our goals. As Professor Thorndike said, "The creation of human material culture and the progress of scientific research all depend on mental activity." Any living creature other than humans is subject to the natural environment to maintain its survival, while humans alone can control nature to improve the social environment and obtain all the necessities of life. Is this not all because humans have the power of thought?</p>
<p>Therefore, if humans want to control the social environment, create a high level of spiritual culture, and achieve the goals of survival and evolution, they must rely on the development of their minds. Whether human life evolves or not can be seen from the progress and decline of thought. Promoting the development of human thought still depends on the capacity to study and control nature. In the last four hundred years or so, thought in Europe has been particularly developed, which is why science has made such amazing progress. If it were not for Copernicus and Galileo loudly advocating methods of thought, could there have been such achievements? The development of human culture and the improvement of life depend on the progress of thought; the progress of thought depends on the development of scientific knowledge, which is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>Thought originates from doubt, and doubt originates from difficulties in life. We do not develop any thoughts when everything goes smoothly in what we do; conversely, when our methods of dealing with life are no longer adapted to actual situations, that is, when difficulties are unresolved, thought arises. Difficulty is the sole condition for the generation of thought, and the progress of the human material environment depends entirely on whether we are satisfied with life. We should constantly study, control, and improve our own environment and find more problems in life to give appropriate solutions in order to train correct thinking. Why is the thinking of scientists particularly developed? There is no other reason except that they can pay attention to things that others do not notice, and they can often raise doubts and seek problems. Newton noticed the apple falling to the ground, thus inventing the law of gravity. Galileo's invention of the pendulum was due to his noticing the swinging lamp in the church. To see what is suspicious and not question it, to avoid difficulties, will never generate thought, advance culture, or enlighten human intelligence.</p>
<p>If we want to raise our ideals of life, we can only break the inertia of thought from time to time. We should be serious about our attitude towards life. When we encounter difficulties, we must find appropriate solutions, and we must pay attention to the subtle things in daily life and grasp the opportunities that trigger thought—within them lies the seed of human evolution!</p>

<h3 id="e120">Another Side of the Career Circle <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Quying</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Yingjin's "In the Career Circle" evokes endless feelings. In today's era of arduous nation-building, tens of thousands of young people enter the so-called "career circle" in groups for economic reasons, carrying full enthusiasm and hope, only to be rewarded with hypocrisy and snobbery. Millions of young people on the isolated island are wandering around in anxiety! How can their pure and enthusiastic minds withstand such illegal devastation?</p>
<p>Since my hometown was occupied by special forces, I have been wandering on the isolated island for three years. It was difficult to get a job. Holding a golden rice bowl, I never did things carelessly. After a month, I began to realize that the difficulty of the job was not in the work, but in dealing with people.</p>
<p>In most commercial firms, there are factions among the internal staff. They consider themselves to belong to a certain faction. Among them, there seems to be a tight organization, whose only responsibility is to attack other factions; to stir up trouble out of nothing and to suck up to superiors -- commonly known as "licking boots". Their skills of concealing evil and promoting good (?!) are indeed worthy of admiration, always with a smiling face, and never saying anything bad in front of people. Shortly after I stepped in there, a social worker from a certain faction tried to pull me into the faction. Because I didn't understand the internal situation, I firmly refused.</p>
<p>Then merciless fate rushed upon me!</p>
<p>A week later, I was invited (?) by the manager into the solemn court. He instructed me that I must consult the advanced people in everything, especially Mr. So-and-so, the social worker, who was the most capable, and finally said, "You are still in the probation period." I had to say yes.</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought to myself that there was no fault in my duties, but I encountered such difficulties. For the sake of the burden on my family, I could not resolutely resign. I began to plan how to deal with it.</p>
<p>I changed my policy and often chatted with them during rest time. For the sake of self-esteem, of course, I did not engage in flattery. Soon, their discrimination against me gradually decreased.</p>
<p>When I looked around at those sharp, wolf-like eyes, I always responded with a sincere smile. I always completed their instructions quickly. Perhaps they were moved! The big knife hidden in the smiling face seemed to have shortened a lot.</p>
<p>As for their false accusations, they were skilled at attacking others. I stood firm, and I never did anything carelessly in my duties, and finally made them unable to use their skills. Now they no longer attack me -- another colleague told me. Although I did not join their group, I was always living in endurance. Soon, the manager summoned me to the office again and encouraged me to work hard, as if I was doing a good job.</p>
<p>Looking back on my own experience, although I feel chilled, there are often dark prospects in a happy environment; conversely. How can there be no dawn in a dark life?</p>
<p>Young friends, work hard!</p>

<p>— Old Elephant</p>
<p>Teachers are like "meals." Tolerant teachers are like white rice, and strict teachers are like brown rice. White rice tastes good, but it is not as nutritious as brown rice. Students often like to eat white rice.</p>
<p>If the teacher is shoddy, the student will develop malnutrition. Now there are more white rice teachers than brown rice teachers on the isolated island, so there are too many malnourished students.</p>
<p>Malnutrition is very dangerous, and if it is not quickly adjusted, it will be difficult to cure in the future. They sigh that their fate is not as good as that of the weevils who eat rice. Qu Fu writes</p>
<h3 id="e122">A Word on the Cross (Continued) <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The words that Jesus prayed to the Heavenly Father included many people; those who ridiculed him on the spot, the Roman officials, the Roman soldiers, the Jewish priests, etc. were all included, "Father, forgive them." This not only showed his trust in God, and his love for his enemies, but also implied the parent-child relationship between the world and God. When a child wants something from his father, he also calls out again and again, "Father, Father." Is it not strange that Jesus asked for mercy and forgiveness for sinners? God was on Mount Sinai, with thunder in front and hail behind, protecting him, the mountains collapsed and the earth cracked, how great, how solemn. But on the cross of Calvary, injured, thirsty, on the verge of death, he still cried out loudly, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." A religion with power is great, but a religion with love is even greater, a just religion is great, but a religion that seeks mercy for others is even greater. Legend has it that a soldier committed a crime and was about to be taken to the officer for trial. He was a person who often committed crimes and had often been punished. As soon as the officer mentioned his name, he said, "Has this man committed a crime again? He has been given all the ways to reform." At that time, a subordinate officer came forward and said, "I am telling my superior that there is only one thing that has not been done for him." "What?" "He has never been forgiven." The officer was a little surprised when he heard this, and said, "Forgive him?" "He thought for a while and ordered someone to bring the prisoner in and ask him what he wanted to say." The soldier replied, "No, I just feel pain for what I have done." At this time, there was an expression on his face, as if he had no hope other than being severely punished for his crime. The officer looked at him with great compassion and said, "Well, we have given you all kinds of ways to reform, now I will forgive you once to see the effect." The soldier was so moved that tears streamed down his face. It is said that from that day on, he became a new person, and became a decent person in society, no longer wearing soldier's clothes. Therefore, I say that a religion with power is great, but a religion with love is even greater.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Exceptional Artist: Walt Disney <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ji</p>
<p>Ever since Walt Disney achieved great success with "Snow White," he has continued to work diligently and strive for perfection. His latest work, "Pinocchio," has already arrived in Shanghai, and its content has been previously introduced in this newspaper. Now, let's talk about this great artist's everyday interactions with people.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Assistants</p>
<p>Under Walt Disney's direction, there are also five directors, thirty-one assistants, fifty-six deputy assistants, thirty-two renowned painters specializing in characters, actions, and expressions, and twenty-six painters specializing in backgrounds. There are also twenty-one effects assistants… In total, he has over a hundred assistants, and they are all top-notch cartoonists and artists in America… The reason he can get so many people to work for him willingly is fourfold:</p>
<p>Understanding Colleagues</p>
<p>The first reason, of course, is that he is willing to give people very generous compensation. This can be done by anyone with large capital.</p>
<p>Second: Disney is a very understanding person. If someone is hindered by their work due to a headache or illness, he always asks them to go back and rest. Although on the surface, the loss of one person's work is inevitable, he knows that the results of forcing someone to work are never good.</p>
<p>Not Ashamed to Ask Those Below</p>
<p>Third: He has the virtue of "not being ashamed to ask those below." Although he is the most famous cartoonist in the world, he has no arrogant habits. Once, he saw someone shaking their head at his original manuscript. He sincerely asked for their criticism. The person mustered their courage and pointed out his mistakes. Disney immediately smiled and accepted their opinion and solemnly treated them to a meal.</p>
<p>True Skill</p>
<p>Fourth: He truly has real skills. One day, an employee of Walt Disney walked into his office and saw Disney buried in his work. Upon seeing it, he admired him to the point of prostration because Disney had completed sixteen paintings in a very short time. If he were asked to do it, it would take him a whole day! Therefore, his employees all admire him, respect him, and wholeheartedly cooperate with him. An artist like this is naturally worthy of our emulation.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Prelude to "The Fragrant Concubine" <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Nv</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong) of the Qing Dynasty was fond of grand achievements and used troops in all directions. After pacifying the Jungar Khanate, he ordered General Zhao Hui to conquer Xinjiang. The rulers of Xinjiang, the brothers Burhanuddin and Khoja Jihan, Khoja had a wife named Fragrant Concubine, who was beautiful and virtuous and had a unique fragrance, hence her name. At that time, the Qing army was approaching Xinjiang's borders. The Fragrant Concubine was hunting with other women, and the citizens bowed to her on the road, vying to ask about national affairs. The concubine said that a battle might be unavoidable. The citizens, hearing this, were filled with righteous indignation and were willing to die for their country. An old melon seller, though old, was full of vigor, and his words were particularly strong. Only the chieftain Badak remained cold and made war-weary remarks. Baso coveted the concubine's beauty and had ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Initially, the Qing army suffered defeats in the conquest of Xinjiang. One day, they suddenly sent an envoy to negotiate peace. Burhanuddin was indecisive and decided to summon Khoja and other chieftains for a meeting. Khoja, having received instructions from the Fragrant Concubine, believed that peace talks meant surrender. He delivered a passionate speech, advocating war. Badak strongly dissented, and Khoja vehemently denounced him. The Qing envoy reiterated their uncompromising stance, and Khoja killed him, making war unavoidable.</p>
<p>The Qing army, with Badak's betrayal, conquered Xinjiang with unstoppable momentum. On the eve of Khoja's departure for battle, the concubine sang and danced to bid him farewell. Unexpectedly, the Qing army launched a surprise night attack. Khoja and others hastily responded, but Badak had already set an ambush with crossbows, and Khoja was killed in battle. Badak then entered the palace to see the concubine, falsely claiming that peace could be negotiated only if the concubine went to Beijing as a hostage, otherwise, the city would be massacred. The concubine agreed.</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozong's conquest of Xinjiang was partly due to the Fragrant Concubine. Upon hearing of the Qing envoy's triumphant return and the capture of the concubine, he was overjoyed. He went to the Western Garden to visit her. At first sight of her beauty, he was enchanted. The sycophantic minister Heshen, anticipating the Emperor's wishes, tried to persuade the concubine, but she suddenly understood and fiercely rebuked him. The Emperor retreated in embarrassment, but his love for the concubine grew stronger.</p>
<p>After entering Beijing, the concubine never stopped longing for her homeland. Heshen requested the Emperor's permission to build a Xinjiang city in the Western Garden to comfort the concubine. The concubine was overjoyed upon seeing the city. She rushed downstairs, and the Xinjiang people in the city bowed to her as before. The concubine almost thought she was dreaming. She eagerly inquired about the situation in her homeland. The people all told lies, except for the old melon seller, who directly accused the concubine of betraying her country. The concubine dejectedly returned, and Emperor Gaozong, hiding behind the curtain, came out and threatened her. The concubine was furious and drew a knife to attack him, but the Emperor narrowly escaped.</p>
<p>The Empress, upon hearing that the Emperor had taken a Xinjiang concubine, became very jealous and complained to the Empress Dowager, strongly arguing that the woman should not be kept. The Empress Dowager had also heard of the concubine's beauty and summoned her. After learning the truth, the Empress Dowager deeply respected and loved her. She advised the Emperor to send her back, but the Emperor firmly refused. The concubine was furious and rebuked Emperor Gaozong, then drew a knife to stab him. The Emperor dodged, but the concubine failed to catch him. At this time, chaos broke out in the palace, and the concubine was finally captured by soldiers.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager sighed and said, "This woman would rather die than be dishonored. We should help her achieve her integrity." She ordered a white silk to be prepared to grant her death. The concubine was overjoyed at the prospect of death and slowly ascended the platform for hanging. The Emperor could not help but shed tears of sorrow and regret.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Street Willows, Wall Flowers (Part 2) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>A Treatise on Marital Harmony Worthy of Your Consideration</p>
<p>It's been too much idle talk; now, we should discuss the scope of street willows and wall flowers and the reasons for their existence. Street willows and wall flowers are merely metaphors for being easily accessible, allowing anyone to pluck them. Prostitutes go without saying. When it comes to figures in the entertainment industry, almost nine out of ten dancers are such, and almost half of storytellers, ballad singers, and acrobats are too. We often see this in local news, but most are deceived by their bosses or colleagues. Perhaps due to proximity, female opera singers, film stars, and theater actresses seem to be better off, but one can't say they are entirely exempt. In short, whether they use their beauty to seduce others or are seduced by others, any improper relationship or action outside the realm of art counts. Originally, "street willow, wall flower" wasn't necessarily a bad term, just a distinction between a family flower and a wild flower.</p>
<p>In terms of gender equality, street willows and wall flowers shouldn't exist at all. However, this problem has continuously occurred for thousands of years, both in China and abroad. We can't help but speculate about the reasons for this. According to the principles of transaction, there must be one party willing to sell and one party willing to buy, and the price is not necessarily money for the transaction to take place. A union between a man and a woman naturally requires mutual consent. Logically, if there's mutual consent, they should get engaged and married. Why resort to illicit affairs? If, after marriage, both parties suddenly feel incompatible, they should divorce and seek a new partner, which is the right thing to do. In this sense, the reason why street willows and wall flowers exist can be said to be because the women themselves are willing. The reason they are willing is either because they are forced by livelihood or because the price of their labor isn't as high as the sacrifice of their beauty. Or, they feel that sacrificing their beauty is more enjoyable than the hardships of work. The most pitiful situation is when, if they don't sacrifice their beauty, their work will be oppressed, and they will have no hope of success. To eliminate these things, we can only improve women's education and work efficiency. But this only pertains to the selling side. If there is only selling and no buying, street willows and wall flowers simply cannot exist. Why don't unmarried men seek their true partners? Why do married husbands still go out seeking pleasure when they have wives at home? A superficial solution is to have happy and fulfilling families that make them feel that wasting money and energy outside is not worth it. The fundamental solution is still to improve women's education and work efficiency. We must understand that taking away men's work means taking away men's pay, and taking away men's obligations means taking away men's rights. When the weight on both sides of the scale is equal, whichever side loses weight will tip to the other side, and that side will suffer. As the proverb says, "After getting Long, one desires Shu." If getting Shu means losing Long, I think people wouldn't dare to desire Shu.</p>

<p>The highly emotional period epic "Hero of Troubled Times" will follow "China Tarzan" at the Jin Cheng Theater. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the scenes are quite grand and astonishing. It has mobilized all the actors, male and female, from Guohua Film Company. It is predicted that it will cause a huge sensation at that time.</p>
<p>Due to "New Hell," "Black Heaven" is about to begin filming soon. According to director Wu Cun, it will be much more humorous than "New Hell," but in terms of awareness, it is very serious and will use simple methods to enlighten the audience with the correct understanding.</p>
<p>In order to make the "Su San's Love Story" segment of the prisoner transfer more exciting, Wu Cun added not only the main courtroom but also a smaller courtroom. Tan Zhiyuan's performance as the poor official vividly portrays the character, adding a lot of power to the entire play.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Wang Huichan Hired by Carlton <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Jiu Geng</p>
<p>Carlton's invitation to the Kylin Child, Wang Huichan, to play the female role has been confirmed. She is scheduled to take the stage on the first of next month. Currently, due to the costumes not yet being completed, there is talk of a delay. Among the people in the performing arts and ticket-selling circles in Shanghai, few know her name. I will briefly describe her background to inform readers. Huichan, also known as Guizhen, is only twenty-nine years old, from the bank of the Yanxi River in Zhejiang. Her ancestor was a famous official in the Qing Dynasty, famous in his hometown. He lived near West Lake, where Huichan was born, so people generally consider her to be from Hangzhou. Her father, Wang Yiquan, is the famous Shanghai qin master, Mr. Wang Baishui. With a family heritage of learning, she is proficient in many plays, and her appearance is graceful and intelligent. Her demeanor is elegant and has the style of a great family. She usually prefers light makeup and has no current bad habits, which is especially commendable. In the past, she has performed as a guest in charity plays, displaying amazing talent and beauty, always earning praise from the audience and being praised as a rising star. The martyr Zhu Xinggong, who sacrificed himself for righteousness, also greatly appreciated her and wrote a poem to praise her: "Rare to combine outstanding talent and jade-like appearance, taking the stage and captivating the audience; after all, her family heritage is evident, indeed reaching mastery; scrutinizing the plot meticulously, humming new tunes clearly; I am also Zhou Lang, able to appreciate music, daring to say my old eyes can still see clearly." (Previously published: January 6 of the eighteenth year in this publication). Zhu rarely praised actors and actresses, never wasting his ink, but he had a unique vision for Huichan, offering much praise and encouragement. Huichan can be proud of herself among her peers.</p>
