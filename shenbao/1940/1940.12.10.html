<p>「倘使公衆欲得充分與有效之警力保護，則應準備付給冒生命危險以維待和平與秩序者以代價，」據說這是在上海公共租界工部局核准了界內華捕待遇，提高百分之百五十後，納稅人方面惟恐負擔劇增，警務處負責官員纔作此說明。故公衆對此，不容有所誤解，以爲警務人員將所謂保護，視如商品，對公衆計價出賣，而更好的保護將視如更高的商品，向公衆要索更大的代價：亦不容有所疑問，以爲既往所得保護，業已恰合於既往所付代價。而所感保護之不足、乃由代價之過低。蓋公衆必須分別認識三點：其一，付若干代價，得若干保護，是公衆與行政之間的一般原理，天公地道，無可非議；倘若聞之於政治敎室，亦必爲學生所樂於承敎：公道所在，不以人廢言。弟二，以上海論，付代價者是納稅人，負責任者是工部局；納稅人對於所獲保護滿意與吾，對於所付代價過重與吾，對於代價與保護相稱與吾，這在納稅人與工部局之間，務須尋覓解答，問題不在警務機關。第三，警務機關以公僕身分，本公務精神，對於公衆必不計較代價如何，務須努力於發揮它最高最善的本能；公衆惟有視其實際成績，證明它可以獲致充分與有效的成績之力量。至於提高華捕待遇，一因物價騰貴，原定俸給絕對不足以維持生活；一因同一組織之內，華捕待遇獨薄，艱危相共而苦樂不均，是違反公道，亦違反行政原則；提高華捕待遇實根據這兩項極嚴肅的理由，却與所謂倘欲若干保護須付若干代價無干。認識了這些分寸，認識了這些界限，我們始得就事論事。更進數言。</p>
<p>當前一事：華捕提高待遇之後，據聞工部局每月因此增加支出七十萬圓，爲數甚鉅，自成問題。考本年秋季即七月起，工部局增加各種捐率，其中以房捐一項而論，秋季共收的五百九十二萬圓，較去秋之三百零二萬圓，增收二百九十萬圓，即每月增收九十六七萬圓；他種捐收，尚不在內。我們不容便謂即此已夠華捕增薪的挹注。然不能不謂市民負担既重。市民負担市政經費，自是市民不容諉卸的義務，然小能不同時檢討工部局的政績。試舉一端，租界之內即工部局管轄之下，究有若干居民，究存若干糧食，每月運入幾何，每决來價幾何，米行米店存貨與囤戶存棧各佔百之幾？現在米貴蔚爲一切物價昂貴的主因，而物貴又蔚爲威脅界內治安的主因；工部局對此局面，如何措施，有何成效？若說操縱壟斷，何以容許操縱壟斷？若說不然，何以米貴？我們以爲或放縱米蠹米奸，或坐視正當商人被誣爲蠹爲奸，乃至於米貴或糧匱，工部局太無作爲！市民何所感？但感小許小便，不許小偸，却許壓榨而無殊於公開的詐欺勒索，綁了市民口腹的票，逼了零星取贖！市民負担已重，而所遇所感若此，我們安得不望工部局好自爲之。</p>
<p>當前又一事：華捕改善待遇之後，總之以創辦華捕福利事業運動。無疑的，這一運動之値得倡導，希望各　協力玉成，關於警務人員的福利，範圍相當廣泛，我們尚無機會，獲悉這决所擬創辦的是何內容。但就一般而論，除了警務機關對於所屬人員有其必不可少的種種設備與辦法之外，社會爲華捕福利亦同時爲市民福利計，針對上海情形，甚應從旁努力者：其一，關於消費合作的組織，現在尚難指望華捕各以其自覺自發，採行合作方法；社會各方應如何從物力方面以及智能方面，予以協助；而與華捕消費有關的各業，允各自其所業，予華捕合作組織以方便。其二，關於精神方面的輔助；這不是說招致華捕於接受捕房訓練與服務辛勞之餘，再上講堂聽講，而務於其業餘，擇所必要，在各種輕鬆而合理的辦法之下，予以自動吸收向上精神的機會，以期直接解除其苦悶與徬徨。間接强調其服務功能。其三，關於社會褒獎的提倡：捕房自有獎懲例，非局外人所欲預聞；然亦輒有爲公務而犧牲而死傷者，所得捕房賞恤，不足以償其失；社會應如何確立辦法，優予褒獎，務使戮力奉公的華捕，萬一有何意外，從名譽上得優越的安慰，從經濟上得充分的保障；以此伸張社會的公道，表示社會的同情，亦即所以改進他們爲公衆服務的信念。這三端的實現，深信華捕當能實享其福利，而所造於社會，必有可觀！</p>

<p>— 黃仲昌</p>
<p>青春時代的攝生要訣</p>
<p>十七八歲的青年，因為生理成熟，開始說去了孩童的天貞而步入了人生之始的時代。于此時期若得一般的疾病，如有斷傷身心的行為，結果會影響一生的幸福。况且青年最寶貴的童貞，每於此時給性的衝動而葬送，致招來了莫大的煩惱。其最普遍者，就是躭溺手淫，弄得精枯腦竭，在明朗的人生大道上，遮上一條黑影，這是多麼危險呀。</p>
<p>手淫差不多為青春期男子所難免，因為他們對於色情的衝動亦於此時為最强烈，故他們專以異性為對象，空思幻想，結果，遂啓了手淫的動機。</p>
<p>手淫過度之後，其最初顯出之病象，就是遺精頻繁，這種病可以說是神經衰弱的一種朕兆，治療之法，惟有先根絕手淫，然後嚴守攝生，每日施行溫水坐浴半小時，及用冷水按摩局部，均有相當功效，不過此種療法，祗可居於輔助地位，尙須於每日睡前服「耐而斯遺精片」三片，則精關鞏固，射精樞的過敏狀態可以消除，其效果確較一切固精片為佳，一個患夢遺頻繁的人，若放任不治，每釀成了性機能障得症，如房事不能，早洩，陰萎等弊害，則治療上比較困難，蓋必須積極施以睾丸內分泌療法，方可恢復其精力而增强其性力也。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我當以臨診三十年的經驗，來闡明現在醫學家一致推崇的眞正睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」對於本症治療上的功效。</p>
<p>「補體康」之對於治療早洩與陰萎，其所以顯效的理由，無非由於蕪力的持久，此當歸功於提鍊時的精密週詳，致寶貴原素得以保存，雖然症狀輕微的患者，服該藥一瓶之後即有奇效，但依本醫師經驗所得，必須連服三瓶，並須嚴守攝生，則根治宿疾者不生問題的，我今生忠告手淫患者，若感覺腦力，性力，體力之衰弱，則男用『補體康』確値得一試。</p>

<p>某區被炸允烈，屋宇無一完整。舉目四顧，但見居民沓雜，或徒步，或駕自由車，或推單輛車及嬰孩坐車，上載被褥與少許食物，蓋已流離失所，四散各覓棲身處去矣。每夜九時三十分，德轟炸機飛來肆虐，越演越烈，及至破曉，華沙叉有一部份被摧毀矣。市民無家可歸者，紛赴市區他處，但求有容身地。貧富雜處，不分尊卑，金錢竟無所用。</p>
<p>初，華沙僅遭轟炸，至九月十三日，市中心已在德方砲隊射程之內。德機盤旋上空，指示砲隊轟擊大街，砲彈在空中卽爆發，彈片落處，當其衝者，非死卽傷，莫可倖免。</p>
<p>約至九月十七日，德軍開始猛烈砲轟，華沙日落砲彈一萬至三萬枚，致在露天行走，頗感危險，縱防空隊亦不得放棄其工作厥後，空襲警報已停發，唯從無綫電中始能聆得將遭轟擊之信號。</p>
<p>入夜砲轟最烈，每晨街頭必發現屍體數百具，恒在道旁草地或就近公園中掩埋之。德方大砲，日有增加，轟擊六日慘烈。每屆轟擊將畢時，砲火熾烈，竟使華沙城中，無一完整之玻璃窗。</p>
<p>余竚立美大使館花園中，見德轟炸機一架被高射砲擊落，幸隨身携有攝影機，遂攝得德機起火下墜情景。</p>
<p>比德機墜地，亟馳往該處，見德機殘骸，尚在冒烟，機員四人，皆已斃命。余旣屬人類，對於飛機連人墜下，應感悲痛，固天性使然也。乃余竟與其他兩美僑同聲歡呼大叫，余等己忘却德飛行員所遺之眷屬，唯認此輩飛行員乃代表三星期來殘殺無辜人民之德政府，故對飛行員之喪生，不禁歡忭鼓舞。此卽戰爭影響於人心之表不也。</p>
<p>九月十六日，乃猶太人之新年，是夜德機飛來，向華沙猶太人集居區投下燒夷彈多枚，遂告起火，焦炭飛揚，染入兩目，牆垣傾圯，觸目驚心。三小時後，方形屋宇二十處已夷爲平地。是夜也，無家可歸者數千人，傷奢不及援救，死屍不遑移除。</p>
<p>華沙被圍，前綫戰事卽在市區邊緣。波蘭士兵逐日從前線返市，率眷領糧，至少得見家屬糧食無虞，安心重上前綫。平民喪生奢較士兵爲多，致夫壻出戰，能否生還不足慮，眷屬在家是吾仍生存，則頗成問題。</p>
<p>日復一日，危險加甚，而余亦不易復作慘劇之旁觀者矣。九月十五日，波方官員請余在華沙無綫電臺用英語播音十分鐘，俾外界能知中立觀察全體美僑受累，然余終不能謝絕此請也。</p>
<p>無綫電臺大厦，不斷被炸已多日。余往播音旣畢，余亟離去，私心始安。其後對於畫夜留守該厦不去奢及電話接綫員之勇敢，益感折服。</p>
<p>一日，余得機向被俘靑年德兵二十餘名，攝取照相，一再詢其何故對波蘭平民施加如此可怖之痛苦，彼等衆口一辭，答曰，「我等實必處此。」</p>
<p>嗣後數日，謠諑四起，如英法大隊飛機將飛來助戰也，德國境內發生叛變，戰爭卽將告終也，諸如此類，不一而足。其最想入非非者，厥爲兩軍將停戰，俾准中立國僑民安全退出華沙，此項謠言，竟成事實。</p>
<p>九月二十一日，無綫電臺發出消息，謂二時至五時停戰三小時，俾持有中立國護照之全體僑民得以撤退。余等會集於白列斯都爾旅館，途見德機飛過，擲下傳單，上載拙劣波蘭文曰，「波蘭人乎，可以休矣！汝輩苟不立刻降服，吾人卽不得不用飛機大砲轟擊。」波蘭人閱之，縱聲大笑。</p>
<p>余等一行計三十國僑民，共的一千二百人，分乘載重車數輛於四時三十分出發，越維斯吐拉河，經一片瓦礫之住宅區，無數工人住屋，已焚成白地。復前行，乃兩軍對壘地，下車步行。余等與前綫波蘭兵握手言別時，不禁熱淚盈眶。未幾，遠處德兵，依稀可辨，漸行漸近，卽見靑年德兵身穿灰色新裝，歡然來迎，有接抱嬰孩者，有藹然代携箱篋者，更有數兵脫下外衣借予婦女禦寒者，無不笑容可掬，彬彬有禮。彼等對吾人返擊已數星期之久，今乃代携提箱，愛撫嬰孩。德軍官則將當時情景，攝成影片，以示德軍之和藹可親</p>
<p>旋抵德境柯尼斯堡下榻旅邸，皆受監視。余滿臉於思，入理髮店整容，不禁同理髮匠詢問德國進攻波蘭之故，據答日，「君不知吾人從未攻擊波蘭，野蠻的波蘭人則一再攻擊德國，吾人迫不得已而自衛耳。」</p>
<p>余又往觀電影，新聞片映出波蘭境內被破壞情形。德人對於征略波蘭，顯頗引以自豪。抑有一事可予注意奢，卽戰事影片，雖映半小時之久，絕無鼓掌喝彩奢。縱映出希特勒在前敵與士兵雜處，親同手足，亦無歡呼之聲。觀衆固見德軍乘勝，長驅入波蘭，然亦見德軍過處，廬舍爲墟，波蘭難民驚惶於色。此實强有力之反戰宜傳，德方檢視昌竟米注意及之。</p>
<p>今日之華沙，纍纍皆廢墟，蠕行街頭者飢病交侵，呼援無門。德方規定波蘭人携械者，有一人被捕，卽槍決十人，而日耳曼族波蘭人（波蘭人稱之爲叛逆一有一人被「喑殺」，卽槍決波蘭人一百名，目驅男婦往廣　竚觀行刑。少數波蘭人遭槍決時，高呼「波蘭不死口號。</p>
<p>傷察症頗猖獗，煤斤缺乏。德兵自波蘭返國，述及一如入墓地之陰厲氣氛，農民默然屈服，及被殺要人兩目中之情恨光芒，」言下猶有懼色。</p>
<p>德國陸軍已將統冶波蘭之困難工作，移交秘密警祭辦理。民事犯每隔數日，卽受鞭撻六十至一百二十下。牧師不得爲處死者舉行赦罪禮。華沙與克拉科兩地之藝術精品已被運往德國。（完）</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十二月七日—　中美金融合作（續）</p>
<p>自一九在三五年以來，中美在金融上的合作，在戰前計有二决，在戰時則以此决的平準基金爲第一次。戰前的兩决，一爲一九三六年五月的白銀協定，規定美國以每盎斯五角四分的代價，向中國收買白銀五千萬盎斯。一爲一九三七年七月九日的金銀互換協定，這一决的合作在中國幣制改革以來最有關鍵，不但結束過去的白銀協定，而建立美國給予中國在戰時經濟上幫助底基礎。這决協定內容所發表的計有兩點：（一）中國政府爲增加黃金準備，美國政府爲依照一九三叫年購銀法起見，實行金銀互換。（二）美國財部並擬將前已商定辦法的範圍，卽中國中央銀行在此辦法下得以保障中美兩國利益的條件，獲得美滙藉以安定其通貨奢予以擴大。不過擴大的辦法，當時並未宣布，直到一九三八年十二月十九日美財部官布金銀協定在是年底滿期後，繼統有效時，方才洩露，謂中國中央銀打曾在保障中美兩國利益的某種條件之下，得以存美的黃金作爲擔保品而自美國獲取信用放款，以便利滙兌的穩定。戰時的貨物的信用放款，均由中央銀行所擔保，蓋卽由於一九三七年七月的貨幣恊定而來。至於此决五千萬的平準基金是不是根據這一個協定而來，當局雖未解說，推想上去是極可能的，因爲無論信用放軟之爲貨幣的或貨物的，在本質上中國獲得美元通貨的一點上，要無差異。所以這一决中美共同平準法幣的合作，雖然是中國在戰時與美國的第一决金融上的結合，而其根源還是出於中國在幣制改革後中美兩國對於法幣制　底維護，道决的平準便是過去維護諸措置底擴大和演變。</p>
<p>至於此决平準的技術，以合衆社電傳美財長二日所言，不外是以一定的滙率從事美元與法幣的買賣。但是一定的滙率究將以何　行市爲水準，實在値得細加考慮。以中美當前的物價比率作爲標準呢？以中國現行的商滙滙率作爲標準呢？依據摩氏所稱：「中國貨幣前曾大跌，近頗平穩，故爲改善中國內部情形而平準法幣，」則以現在較黑市爲高的商滙滙率，似乎較有可能的被採爲平準的標準。上海外滙市塲上曾有商滙滙率改爲十美元與六便士的傳說，想卽基於此項觀點。但是中美兩國若無嚴秘的管理外滙巿塲的辦法，則維持目今的較高的商滙滙率，已屬不甚智之　，若以過高的商滙滙率來作平準的標準，賢明的中美財政當局恐不致出此，因爲結果無異是間接上予中美共同的對象以金融上的幫助，以延長它的侵略的力量。至如說隔離了上海的滙市而單獨提高自由中國內的外匯水準，無　它已非中美此次金融合作的本意，耍知上海滙市與自由中國經濟情形無形中是具有雄偉的聯繫，事實上決計難以做到的阿！所以權衡得失計算利害，恐怕將以依反侵略的國際局勢定一可變的定率，而對法幣　價加以平準呢！</p>
<p>總之，自中美英三國形成反侵略陣綫以來，法幣前途早處於有利的地位，五月以來，上每滙市的演變業經證明，毌待筆者嘵舌。自七月十八日美國援助英國取締自由英鎊以來，反侵略的金融陣錢已有初步的建設，可是中國尚未參加，及本月二日中美合作平準法幣之後，於是中美英不但在政治上形成反侵略的陣綫，卽在金融上也建設了反侵略的堅固的堡壘。以後三國的余融在中國豐富的資源和美國雄厚的財力底支持之下，可不因戰爭的影響而見此漲彼落彼昂此賤底不安現象發生，從而擴展反侵略的力量，以打擊遠東和歐洲的新秩序的建立。則此决中美間的新的金融合作，固不僅上海外滙市塲投機者以及利用滙市作其他投機奢底沒落的開端而已！　（完）</p>

<p>公共租界工部局暨法租界公董局、鑒於近來米價飛漲、影響民食匪淺、爰經工部局會同法租界公董局、邀請虞洽卿氏暨米業團體代表、於昨（九）日下午二時、在工部局會議室開會討論如何穩定米市辦法、當時米業團體代表出席者、計有陳子彝·朱子香·陳世德·何湘谷·邢志剛·等十八人、法租界公董局代表爲糧食委員會齊白·法捕房愛米里諾夫。克洛斯·艾祖年·暨朱一桂五人、工部局代表爲何副總辦德奎，糧食委員會披特遜·畢土萊·三人、主席爲何副總辦德奎、</p>
<p>五種洋米　最高價格</p>
<p>討論事項計有（一）公倉儲米、（二）訂購洋米、（三）穩定米市、散會以後卽由評價委員會各委員假座原會塲舉行會議、當經評定洋米最高價格五種、計（一）一號西貢每石八十七元、（二）二號西貢每石八十一元五角、（三）二號暹邏每石八十元、（四）高火紋每石八十六元、（五）小絞每石七十九元、上項限價、自本（十）日起實行、</p>
<p>公倉辦法</p>
<p>昨日會議討論經過、計（一）公倉儲米案、首由虞洽卿氏設明公倉計劃、並表示希望由米業準備洋米六萬包、其他各業四萬包、銀錢業五萬包，社會熱心人士五萬包、合計二十萬包、作爲公倉之常備儲糧、討論結果、上項計劃之原則、一致贊同、至於切實可行之細則、當由豆米行業暨雜糧油餅業兩同業公會、推派代表各兩人、與虞氏會同擬訂、付諸實施、（二）訂購洋米案、議決在本年年底以前、由米業儘早再向國外訂購洋米十萬包、增厚上海存底、一經訂齊以後、卽行彙報兩工部局備査、</p>
<p>米糧交易　須付定洋</p>
<p>（三）穩定米巿案、查按照向例、米市塲米糧交易、概不預付定洋、據主席表示意見、以爲此種慣例、定以助長投機交易、此後米糧買賣、應預付定洋、結果一致議決、自本月十二日起、凡在米市塲　米者、一律當天先付定洋每包五元、並限定五天以內付款出貨、交由米市塲切實執行、再目前米價在漲、亟應取締、以安市况、旋經議決、促請糧食評價委員會尅日恢復工作、重定米價、所有經該委員會評定之米價、作爲最高價格、不得超出、如有逾越限價情事、一經査朋屬實、定當依法嚴辦、</p>
<p>法領與越　當局接觸</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市重要米商、今日（九日）午後、與工部局官員、會商民食問題、同時法領署披露法總領事馬傑禮已與越南當局接觸、討論運洋米來滬事、據馬傑禮聲稱、過去一星期內、渠曾與越南法當局獲得接觸、叩以西貢米將否准許運出越南、尚未接得正式答覆云、又據工部局官員稱、傳聞越南方面將不許十二月二十六日以後訂購之頭號西貢米出口、惟二號以下者、續許運來、目下之大問題、厥爲是吾能獲得船隻、以載米糧云、</p>
<p>米七萬包　明日到埠</p>
<p>同時、聞法船達達南號載西貢米約七萬包、將於明日（十日）抵此、衆信該批米糧運到、將使米價漲風、暫告停止、昨日（八日）亦有洋米二萬包運來觀察者謂、日方若准國米暢運來滬、則本市米糧、不致匱乏、米價亦無激漲之虞矣、</p>
<p>利潤規定　米價下跌</p>
<p>全巿千餘米號、對於米價之未能穩定、殊爲不安、因米價高昂後、採購米糧成本、亦須加大、使經濟上難於周轉、除呈請當局要求將本市之巨額存米、悉予公開出售外、並知照同業、須遵守每石照市價應得之利潤爲一元半、不得高抬、並禁止攙雜次貨、以朦混買客、昨日米市、因近日港越洋米大量擁到、達十餘萬石、而當局已有制裁投機份子之決心、故人心均為看小、囤戶亦大量拋出、致每石米價、各檔均下跌、預計在當局與米業團體會同制裁之下、必將繼續下跌、</p>
<p>組小組會　從長討論</p>
<p>在昨日會議中、前晚本有將仰光米每包限價規定在九十六元以下說、且決定調査集中上海存底、限令出售之說、但昨日會議結果、並未有結果、詢之預會之某氏、據談、一時尚宋得妥善辦法、故祇得將若干建議、移交小組委員會、加以討論、至該會柯時成立、現尚未定、但決循各方之熱切希望、於最短期內成立、</p>

<p>前夜（八日）西區有「市警」一名、失事殞生、工部局警務處警員五人、到塲調査、遭日憲兵扣留、並有督察長長石氏受毆辱、關於此事、工部局警務處長包文少校、昨晨（九日）巳向局方提出正式報告、聞工部局卽將向日當局提出强硬抗議、</p>
<p>躍登卡車　忽又跌下</p>
<p>據目覩其事之某華人述經過如下、前夜九時甫過、凱納路憶定盤路轉角、有「市警」一名、躍上芷在行駛中之卡車一輛、忽爾墜下、腦部受震、未幾、公共租界救火會之救護車駛到、將傷警」載去、</p>
<p>毆辱警長　並加扣留</p>
<p>移時、公共租界督察長石氏與副督察長鄧屈萊率華捕三人趕到、方加調査中、日憲兵一隊亦到、解除公共租界警員之武裝、並有憲兵一名、對督察長石氏　頰數下，然後共被押人極司非而路九十四號西區日憲兵部、經工部局警務處要員向日當局交涉後、至夜間十一時零五分、始釋出、</p>
<p>日方諉稱　出於誤會</p>
<p>據日方昨日所傳、日憲兵因聞公共租界警員開槍擊斃「市警」一名、故取此嚴峻行動、惟官方人士拒不發言、謂刻正候詳報中、至於傷「警」經救護車送入仁濟醫院、已傷重斃命、昨夜公共租界五警員被扣後、日當局立刻將極司非爾路遮斷、不准通行、至夜間十一時、始復開放、同時、滬西封鎖區四週情况、昨日仍稱安靜、無甚變化、封鎖將於何日撒除、則未能向日官方探獲消息、</p>
<p>滬西居民　繞道而行</p>
<p>日方封鎖滬西以來、業經旬日、雖有三處地方開放、惟限制綦嚴、居民終感不便、大中社記者昨日巡行封鎖區四週、見此項半封鎖狀態、仍繼續存在，並無任何變化、區內大部份居民、不願在刺刀之下、入愚園路口及大西路購票乘坐所謂「滬西市民公共汽車」、寗繞遠道進入、故由愚園路六〇八弄（卽錢家巷）出入者最多、而英商七路公共汽車營業、亦大爲發達、蓋可由靜安寺路乘至海格路憶定盤路口而轉入封鎖區也、此外乘人力車至開納路轉入憶定盤路愚園路奢亦甚多、</p>

<p>土貨輸出　倍於去年</p>
<p>戰後中國土貨之輸出、總値前年七萬六千二百六十四萬元、去年十萬零二千七百二十四萬元、今年一月至十月十六萬二千二百七十九萬元、此項出口貨値總額、卽等於同額之外滙資金、可純爲政府所獲得、惟政府對於結售外匯之出口商仍須給與本國貨幣、爲貨物之代價、</p>
<p>僑匯額與　去年相埒</p>
<p>據一般之估計、民國二十八年僑胞匯款回祖國、總額已逾六萬萬元、今年十月底截止、僑胞匯款回祖國、的爲五萬五千萬元、預料今年僑胞之匯款、當在六萬萬元以上、况中國銀行之國際匯兌網、佈置已成功、並訂立優待辦法、减低匯水、便利僑民、</p>
<p>金銀集中　寄存海外</p>
<p>民國二十七年出口之金銀、金七百四十六萬三千一百六十五金、銀八千零三十三萬零零三十七元、民國二十八年出口之金銀、金一百三十九萬三千二百金、銀一百九十六萬七千六百九十七元、今年十月底截止、金出口一千零十三萬一千一百六十金、銀出口一千五百二十九萬四千六百四十元、是項金銀、均由政府統制、輸往英美等國、或寄存海外銀行、或換取外滙、</p>

<p>發砲掩護　登陸未逞</p>
<p>日機轟炸後、向龍山出海逸去、未久停止泊穿山洋面日艦一艘、突卸去砲衣、向岸開砲四十餘發、日艦藉砲聲掩護下、潛行放汽艇三艘、載兵數十名、圖在雙泉港堤岸登陸、當經岸上哨兵發覺、由防軍以排砲及機槍猛烈射擊、日艦始不又退去、</p>

<p>當日艦開砲時、自鎭海口外之大游山起、至象山港·石浦·東門島止、環泊日艦達十五艘之多、當晚始先後離去、據今晨航業界消息、除石浦東門島尚泊有日艦三艘、瀝港泊有一艘、龍山泊有二艘外、其他海面已無日艦、又穿山上空、昨日又有日機三架偵察、惟未投彈、</p>

<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>我總是以爲在人類種種的新發明中，早已有大自然的傑作當它們的模型；比旁的動物更聰明的人類，不過善於模仿，順便拿來抄襲一下便了。現在隨手拈幾個例證，以實吾言。</p>
<p>降落傘兵</p>
<p>人在村邊，路旁，壟頭，草地，幾乎到處可見的一種矮矮的，葉作鋸齒形的小黃花，它的名子是蒲公英，就是文人學士口中的「碧雲天，黃花地」，和什麼「郊外黃花金釘釘地」的那蒲公英啊。這種貌似猥卑，沒有人稀奇欣賞的蒲公英，却具有一種異常龐大的繁殖能力；因爲它能採取一種最有功效的拓殖領土的方法，就是現在人所熟知的，航空降落傘的方法。</p>
<p>原來當它的種子成熟的時候，就從花托上簇擁出一團白毛蒙茸的絨毯來：你看那絨毯的幾何圖案式的組織是多麼精緻和工整啊！它是由許多褐色的種子排列而成的。假設你逼近仔細觀祭一下，你就可以看見在每一顆種子的頭上，全繫着一頂白毛造成的小圓傘：這些就是那整隊待發要去征服隣土的一羣傘兵啊！它們只等風一吹來，便凌空直上，飄飄蕩蕩的往各處侵略，降落在那裹，便在那裏生根發芽，安家立業，這塊領土當然就算被它征服了。說也奇怪，這些種子所帶着的降落傘，還有「水上飛機」的作用：因爲假設有一個傘兵被風吹到水裹，那頂小傘便馬上捲作一團，能載着傘兵到適宜的地方登陸。我們現在可以明瞭無論什麼地方全有蒲公英蹤跡的原因了。</p>
<p>讀者如有興緻，不妨在曠野裏或花園裹，找到一隻蒲公英的絨毬：你們搯下來，用口一吹，便可見百十個白色的降落傘紛紛飛舞，你們算是親眼看見前多　少天荷蘭國的戰祝了。</p>
<p>定時炸彈</p>
<p>在南美洲熱帶地方，出產一種名叫Sablier　elastique的喬木。它的樹汁像似牛奶，是作樹膠的原料，種子榨出油來可以治病。然而頂奇怪的，是它的果實散播種子的方法：我們眞可以把它叫作「定時炸彈」這種果實比人頭還大，作扁圓形，外殼分裂成十幾瓣到二十瓣，我們可以想像它同剝了皮的文旦差不多。它到了完全成熟的時候，外殼便乾癟了；由着它內裹一種不可統制的潛藏力，於是轟然一聲，驚天動地，眞好像炸彈爆裂一般，把果瓣和種子射擊到極遠的地方。這不是定時炸彈是什麼？採取保藏它作標本用的博物院，怕它作祟，便用鐵絲把它緊緊纏繞起來。然而就是這樣，還當不住它有時候脾氣發作，把玻璃廚炸個粉碎—</p>
<p>黑色烟幕</p>
<p>作烟慕的這　伙，是我們比較熟識的一種動物了：就是我們有時拿牠佐飯下酒的烏賊啊！我們知道在牠的肚子裏生有一個「墨囊」當牠被敵人追逐，比方快要被一條大魚吞噬的時候，牠就望着敵人的眼睛把墨汁噴射過去。墨汁因着瀰散作用，於是很快的變成了一團墨霧。當敵人的眼睛被這黑霧弄的分不淸東西南北的時候，烏賊便趁機逃之夭夭了。這不是一種很奇妙的烟幕作用麼？</p>
<p>坦克陷阱</p>
<p>有一種名叫Fourmi-lion的昆蟲，我們可惟譯作「蟻獅」，因爲牠的幼蟲是專門捉螞蟻來作食糧的。幼蟲捉螞蟻的法子，是在沙土地裏掘一個漏斗形的洞穴，牠自己蹲在穴底很耐心的等着。假設有一個螞蟻在穴邊走動：這小坦克車自身的　量會叫穴邊的沙土崩陷，把牠一下子滑到穴底；埋伏在下面的小蟻獅，便可以把牠捉來果腹了。有的時候，這小蟻獅從嘴裹噴射出一陣沙雨來，熚熚爆爆，好像開機關槍似的，把敵人從上邊打下來。這又可稱爲　打坦克車的平射砲了。</p>
<p>發臭毒氣</p>
<p>在放毒氣的動物當中，最為我們所熟知的，要算那尾毛能造小楷筆的鼬鼠，俗名黃鼠狼的了。牠什被人或較大的動物所追　的時候，就從牠肛鬥的一道腺裏放出叫人難以忍受的惡臭。外國人稱這種獸爲「臭獸」，又有「臭獸越踢越臭」的俗諺。在美洲有牠同類的一種動物，名叫Monfette牠肛門裏的臭汁能射到一丈多遠。這種東西的臭味是那麼强烈；以致射到房屋裏房屋就不能冉住，沾到衣服匕衣服就不能再穿！被牠射中的動物是不是要臭死，尚不得而知，不過稱這種東西爲毒氣不算言之過當吧。</p>

<h3 id="c120">成功的詮釋 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 子來</p>
<p>人沒有不想成功的，可是成功的人實在不多。因爲一般的人，大都立志不堅，勇氣不足，遇到困難，便心喪氣餒，中途廢止，不肯再加努力。成功不是容易事，往往要經過幾决失敗，幾决奮鬥，纔能達到目的。而一般人對於成功的意義的誤解，以致走錯了路，使與成功的目的，愈去愈遠，也是一個原因。</p>
<p>最容易使人從成功聯想及的是金錢和權勢。以爲有了金錢或權勢，便可算是成功。因此囤積操縱投機賭博出賣良心，爭權奪利，無所不爲，想達到「成功」的目的。其實，金錢和權勢，那裏是權衡成功的砝碼呢？達官當翁，那裹是成功的人物呢？愛因斯坦是被希特勒驅逐的猶太難民；甘地的全部財產，有人估計只値七角五分錢。但一個是相對論的發明者，一個是印度獨立運動的領導者。可是也不要誤會聲名和成功的關係。成功的人不但不一定享有盛名，且有蒙受極大恥辱的。蘇格拉底不是被判處死刑的嗎？伽利略不是被認爲大逆不道的嗎？哥侖布發現了新大陸，却被侮爲囚犯，鎖着手鐐的解回西班牙，受辱含垢，至於老死。連他所發現的大陸，也不以他的名爲紀念，反紀念一個製圖員叫阿美利哥的。而令名赫赫的假慈善家假敎育家，到處可有。所以不必自我宜傳，更無須買人捧塲，欺世盜名，以爲成功。</p>
<p>我們明白了抓錢抓權沽名釣譽都不是達到成功的方法，因爲有錢有權有名不一定是成功，成功不一定有錢有權有名。惟有增加人類幸福的人是成功的人，惟有老老實實的努力是達到成功的方法。不怕困難，不怕失敗，認定目標，努力奮鬥，沒有不成功的；卽使失敗，能够奮鬥到底，也就是成功！</p>

<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>前艙伺候的人，初聞艙　拍桌子的聲音，一個年紀五十多歲的胖婦人，面上塗粉，頰上簪花的，慌忙立起身，向裏窺探。見大家面上臉色尚好，正在彼此喝酒，方纔放了心。儒生朝外坐的，一眼已瞧見了伊。就說道：「徐大娘添酒來。」徐大娘早走上前，撮着笑臉，說道：「張相公，靜園到了。你們要不要上岸？酒可以少喝一些，恐怕影兒絳兒都要喝醉了。」儒生點點頭道：「靜園已到了嗎？我們上岸走走也好。」這時候舟子已點着篙子，漸漸把船靠近岸去。忽聽岸邊有人大聲嚷着道：「船上的貴人，將一些酒肉給俺吃喝可好嗎？俺今天肚子尚是空空咧。」聲如洪鐘，響震耳鼓。儒生和麗人等在艙中舉首向蓬牕外看時，只見一個很魁梧的大漢，身穿敞衣，手托鐵缽，直挺挺的立在河岸上一株大柳樹。雖然是個吹簫托缽者流，可是容貌生得奇怪，和平常乞兒不同。額上一個很深的刀疤，雙目炯炯有神，頷下虬髯如戟，宛比當年的鍾進士，射出那如電的目光，向船牕裹耽耽地注視着。</p>
<p>（二）壯士何來</p>
<p>絳子一見這個虬髯大漢，嚇得背轉了臉，設道：啊呀！這個大漢好不令人駭怕？」麗人却很注意的屬目於他。船頭上的舟子早高聲叱道：「你這乞丐爲什麽道般大驚小怪？我們船未停泊，你已向我們來行乞了，快快滾開去，不要惱了我們的張相公。」大漢見舟子向他呵斥，早變了顏色，雙目一睜道「俺祗向你們借些酒喝喝，又不乞錢，你這船家倚着誰的勢力，要來欺侮飄泊天涯的人嗎？什麼張相公？我倒要見見他。」說話未畢，一聳身已跳至　首，這船一些兒也不搖晃。這樣重而大的身軀，竟輕如無物。舟子還是不知利害，伸手把大漢一推，要想將他推落水中。誰料那大漢的身軀如泰山一般。動也不動，舟子反倒退兩步，險些兒一個倒栽葱翻跌下水。大漢哈哈笑道「你休要蜻蜓撼石柱，不識進退，自己討苦頭吃」儒生和麗人瞧着，早一齊走出艙來。船上旁人見來了一個頑强的乞丐，還想叱責。麗人早把手同衆人搖搖，叫他們休要和這大漢理論。自己輕移蓮步，走過去說道：「壯士，你到我們船上來做甚？」那大漢見一個如花如玉的美人兒姗姗地走來，頓時擴悍之氣盡歛，立正着說道：「原來是柳家姑娘。俺因爲今天沒有酒喝，見此畫舫，定是有錢之人出來遊春，所以乞些餘瀝，以潤枯喉，並不敢有別的舉動。」麗人聽大漢喚伊柳姑娘，不由一怔，便又問道：「壯士和我素不相識，怎知我姓柳呢？」（五）</p>

<p>— 第三名　鄭九霄</p>
<p>在「魂斷藍橋」正片之前，有一短片「人類的僕投」（Servant　of　Mankind），把美國歷史上的偉人：華盛　，林肯，第三個該輪釗的應是安迪生；將他一生的發明，簡明地叙述出來。末幕有四五僩兒童，仰望着偉人的遺影，一種天眞的茫然的注視，使我有說不出的感　！</p>
<p>這張短片，在「幼年安迪生」開映不久之後見到，顯然是有意義的。「幼年安迪生」給我的印象，在迴憶中，像一葉飽受風力的孤帆，在明朗的海十，向無際的天邊駛去。</p>
<p>科學的精神，卽是求知的精神。牛頓曾經說過：「眞理像大海般展開在前，都是我們所不知道的，我不過是個在海邊拾貝殼的孩子。」我相信這決不是智奢謙遜之詞，而是爲學的人，忠誠的自白。影片中安迪生也說了相似的話：「有許多許多事情我不知道哩，這些事情都使我驚奇。你看那些草吧，爲什麼它們是綠色的呢？爲什麽不是紫的，或是黑的黃的呢？而當一個聲音消失到我們聽不見之後，牠又到那裏去了呢？」「那些是根本沒有人知道的」。這是他妹妹的同答；也就是一般人的回答。這不但是根本沒有人知道，幷且是根本沒有人想去知道的。安迪生終於在許多許多不知道的事情中，知道了許多許多的事情。在一八七八年，把消失了的聲音抓住，解答了一樁「我不知道一的問題。</p>
<p>但是科學的精神，不僅在求知，而在不斷的求知。一切自然現象，世上有不少的人，想去了解，爲什麼只讓幾個人找得答案呢？一八七九年，當他發明電燈的時候，燈絲一項，曾經試騐了九千决，方始成功。這種刻苦求知，專一不懈的精神，給予我們靑年，是多麼深刻的敎訓！生活的意義，就是繼續不斷的學習。在影片中，看到地窖化騐室中，放着有毒性標識的一百多隻盤子，以及後來販賣所得，變爲　上一本本化學書籍時，彷彿是在諷嘲我們靑年因循，苟且的惰性！也直接粉碎了一般小有聰明，作天才夢者的在想幻曲。</p>
<p>安迪生的偉大處，就在他始終爲人着想，相少顧到他自己。在八十五年生涯中，發明了幾百件東西，都是人類所需要的。在他的思想中，沒有絲毫功利的觀念，揉雜其間。影片中可以見到的，也是事實，當他在貨車下搶救站長的兒子，這種捨已爲人的勇氣，已經充分的顯露了。又如他母親腰病，沒有充足的亮光，可　手術時，他一時急智，借鏡子的反光，以拯救自己母親的危難。在這時，世上石莊燈下的黯淡，以及人間母難的痛苦，在他幼小的心苗中，已有肩担人類的責任之企圖了。二十世紀世界的光明，何嘗不是由於他星星心頭的溫情所併發呢？</p>
<p>在萬千影片裏，謳歌男女之情，太使我們厭倦了。這張特出的偉記片，使我潛受到一種人間最崇高的情緒的傳染。釋迦所以成了佛，耶蘇所以成爲救主，光輝照耀於數十年歷史上的，就是他們二人願把全人類的悲哀，有一人負担起來之意。科學家對眞理的追求，政治家爲主義而犧牲，其出發點都是相同的。雖時代不同，釋名各異，然這是人間所崇高的情操，是無異義的。在二小時間中，藉他有電影的發明，使異國異代的我，對他偉大生涯的開始，留下了印象，來激發自己了。</p>
<h3 id="c124">英國特攝戰事影片 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 容同</p>
<p>在戰時英國的電影院生意興隆是不足怪的，因爲除了正片外，還有緊張熱烈的戰事新聞片可看。譬如像艦隊的作戰，空軍戰士的揚威，炸彈的驟降，兵工廠的怒吼等，都是每一個愛國的國民所喜愛的。最近央國情報部又特地攝製了一套鼓舞國民同仇敵愾的五分鐘戰畢短片，供給各影院加映。在這許多短片中，最精彩的一部小說是「格　脫小姐開門延敵記」（Miss　GrantGoes　to　the　Door）。故事是相當刺激的——有兩個老處女居住在英國冷落的一角，有一天晚上，當敎堂中空襲警報的鐘聲大作時，她們在花園裏發現一個已死的傘兵。這時，忽然有一個英國裝束的軍官敲門進來，說他迷失了到飛機　去的途徑，要求暫借本城的地圖一閱。不料那位格蘭脫小姐早已仟家熟讀過情報部發下的戰時手冊，她密切的留　那個軍官的語音，結果被她發現一個破綻，證明他原來是一個德國人。於是她就不客氣地拿起得自已死傘兵身上的手槍逼住了他，而另一個便駕了自由車出門去呼援。那個德國人狡猾地問格蘭脫小姐時一根紙烟，格蘭脫小姐答應了這個要求，而他就乘她略一疏忽出其不意把她打倒·但正當伸奪門而出的時候，當地的警軍也已如飛馳至了。本片的主　就是：隨時隨地提防敵方傘兵。</p>
<p>無疑的，這種影片在警醒民衆訓練民衆方面，收效是極爲宏大的。現在英國情報部正動員全國筱秀的電影從業員——包括導演，演員，技師等，繼續攝製這種五百呎長的短片。聽晚每攝製一部所費的代價不過二千美元，差不多只合到好萊場的短片成本的十分之一·（譯自TIME）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rumor of Secret Agreement Between China and Britain Officially Denied by Both Countries; Britain Adopts Parallel Policy with the United States to Secure the Far East; Guo Taiqi Makes Smooth Progress in Negotiations in London <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - Today, the National Government and the British Embassy have strongly denied the rumor spread by the Japanese side that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is currently negotiating a secret military agreement with the Chinese government. According to the British Embassy, there is no such development under consideration. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated after confirming that this news was groundless that no such negotiations had been conducted between the Chinese authorities and the diplomatic representatives of the British government. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A certain Japanese news agency has issued a message stating that China and Britain are currently negotiating a secret military agreement, which informed sources in China believe to be absurd. The British Embassy here has firmly denied it, and the Chinese government will also issue a formal statement denying it. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London - There are now various indications that Britain is adopting a parallel policy with the United States to secure the Far East. Recently, an understanding has been reached in principle on the issue of British aid to China, but the amount of this substantial loan is still under negotiation. However, it is rumored that the total amount is roughly the same as the US loan to China. In recent days, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has been in frequent contact with British Foreign Secretary Halifax, Under-Secretary of State Butler, and Lord Privy Seal Attlee, all of whom are discussing the general situation in the Far East and how Britain can provide financial and material assistance to China to the greatest extent possible. The scope of the discussion can be roughly divided into several points: (1) Allocating special funds as a reserve fund for Chinese legal tender; (2) Following the precedent of the Anglo-Turkish and Anglo-Portuguese agreements, increasing credit loans for China to purchase goods in the UK, British dominions, and the Sterling bloc countries. The relevant parties have systematically studied the above two points and made smooth progress. People in London are satisfied with the progress of the negotiations, because the treaty indicates that Japan is prepared to assist the Axis powers and strike against Britain. Under the fierce air raids and the threat of aggression by German aircraft, Britain cannot be deceived by Japan again, saying that Japan's membership is not directed against Britain, and ignoring the importance of Japan's membership. Now that China has obtained substantial assistance from the United States and the Soviet Union will never change its policy towards China, the situation in the Sino-Japanese war will soon change. Conversely, the European countries allied with the United States are too far from the Far East and cannot provide financial or military assistance to each other. After three years of attrition warfare, China's strength has been increasing, and assistance to China has been increasing. In contrast, it is not difficult to predict the future of the Sino-Japanese war. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central Memorial Week; He Yingqin Reports; Recent Military Victory in Northern Hubei of Great Significance; Japanese Attempt Has Been Crushed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - At the Central Memorial Week this morning, He Yingqin reported on the recent military situation in Northern Hubei, stating that the Japanese army's war of aggression against China has now become bogged down and has no spare capacity to launch any offensive. However, the so-called Japan-Thailand treaty is nothing more than a piece of waste paper, and it is attempting to seek a decisive victory militarily. Troops were drawn from various places to launch an offensive in the Xiang River basin. From the 23rd of last month, the Japanese army on both sides of the Xiang River began to act. One unit of the Japanese army on the east bank advanced from Jingxi River and other places towards Lishan, while another unit advanced from Zhongxiang towards Changshoudian and other places on the western foothills of Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army on the west bank joined with the Japanese army from Zhongxiang and other places on the east bank and advanced northwards from the line of Dangyang Yuxi River Jingmen. With land and air coordination, the momentum was very fierce. The Chinese army waited at ease and dealt them a heavy blow. On the 28th, all routes were reported to have collapsed. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, recapturing cities, towns, and villages such as Shidian, Jingmingpu, Chuohualing, Shushan, Jinjiling, Anju, Junchuan, Hejiadian, Tangjiawan Jiulishan, Taerwan, Huantan, Zhangjiaji, Majiaji, and Changxundian on the east bank, directly approaching the vicinity of Zhongxiang County; and recapturing Kuaihuopu, Lijiadang, Xianju, Zengjiawan, Lixi, and Chi Miao and other places on the west bank, advancing to the outskirts of Jingmen. By the 1st of this month, all the Japanese forces in various places had been cleared. In total, more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers, including the Japanese Kawasaka Brigade Commander, were killed in this campaign, creating the largest recent victory in that area. The Japanese army's so-called winter offensive has been completely crushed. Analyzing the Japanese army's attempt to launch this offensive, there are no more than the following three intentions: (1) To echo the recognition of the puppet regime organization, indicating that it still has the ability to continue its offensive; (2) To侥倖 defeat the field army of the [unclear] group, thereby taking Xiangfan and threatening [unclear]; (3) If it cannot defeat the Chinese field army, but can make slight advances, it can also claim victory and reduce the side threat to Yisha. However, the result was the opposite. Not only did the Japanese fail to achieve all their goals, but they suffered great losses. On the one hand, the Chinese army took only seven days to completely repel the invading Japanese army in this battle. Its significance is extremely important. First, it keeps the Japanese army that broke into Yisha still under the side control of China, with no room for development, and not only cannot threaten [unclear], but the Chinese army can also take advantage of the situation at any time. Second, the Chinese army's victory this time can not only make the international community understand that Japan is powerless, but also directly affect the psychology of the Japanese military and civilians. In short, since the victory of this battle, the fact that the Japanese army is getting weaker and weaker and the Chinese army is getting stronger and stronger has become an unbreakable truth. Our whole country should follow the instructions of the President, obey the national policy, and work together to fight hard. I believe that the ultimate victory will certainly come as the President expects (earlier). (Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Fierce Fighting Reported on the Thai-Vietnamese Border; Thai Planes Bomb Savannakhet; Five Divisions of Chinese Troops Concentrated on the Guangxi Border <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Hanoi - Today, it is reported that fierce fighting has broken out in the northern part of Laos Province. French and Thai troops have been exchanging heavy fire with machine guns and aircraft on their respective border outposts. French officials strongly stated that they are very willing to negotiate and that this conflict will not affect the peaceful resolution of the dispute, but also stated that they cannot tolerate any attacks and will retaliate. The Thais, on the other hand, are increasingly complacent. Official reports state that on Sunday morning, the Thai army unjustifiably fired machine guns at our army on the banks of the Mekong River, and our army returned fire. There were no casualties on our side. Shooting broke out again at 10:00 am. In the afternoon, Thai planes flew into Vietnamese territory without dropping bombs. At 5:00 pm, one fighter plane and three light bombers dropped ten bombs on Vietnam, injuring one civilian, burning down one house, and destroying two thatched huts. The French authorities have been patient and willing to negotiate for the past three months, but they cannot tolerate this matter, so this morning French planes also dropped twelve bombs on Lakon in Thai territory. Furthermore, authoritative sources said tonight that Thai planes dropped seven bombs on Savannakhet at 10:40 am this morning, causing only material damage and no casualties. In addition, authoritative Chinese sources stated that five Chinese divisions, equipped with heavy artillery, have been concentrated on the Guangxi border. Travelers confirmed this information, saying that the number of Chinese troops is increasing daily. Chinese sources also mocked that the concentration of Chinese troops is the result of the recent Sino-British agreement, designed to prevent the Japanese from advancing south again. In addition, British Consul General in Vietnam, Hutchison, recently entrusted the United Press reporter to deny the Japanese Tokyo Broadcasting Station's claim that the British government sympathizes with Thailand's territorial demands on Vietnam. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - This morning, an official document here stated that the atmosphere between Thailand and Vietnam has eased slightly, but there are still occasional exchanges of gunfire across the Mekong River. Recently, when the People's Assembly held its last meeting of the current session, the Thai Prime Minister's wording was quite peaceful, so people's minds are calmer. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Savannakhet - A Thai plane bombed here at 10:30 am this morning and strafed with machine guns for ten minutes. Three French planes immediately took off to engage it, and the Thai plane left. At 11:30 am, while the reporter was sending this telegram at the post office, a second squadron of Thai planes arrived here again. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Savannakhet - At 7:45 am this morning, the French army fired more than 20 shells at the Thai army somewhere near here. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - After two days of silence, the High Command announced yesterday that fighting had broken out on the Mekong River on December 6th and 7th. Vietnamese troops attacked Thai troops in Aranyaprathet, Ronkai, and Pan Qingburi (all transliterations) to retaliate. On December 6th, the French army made six attacks, and the Thai army also returned fire. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>New York - Thai Foreign Ministry Special Advisor Duller Bar recently stated that if the Thai-Vietnamese situation continues to be tense and leads to war, then there is a danger that Japan will profit from it. If Thailand attacks Vietnam, the Vietnamese natives will inevitably rise up in revolution and resist the French. Under this circumstance, Japan will inevitably use the excuse of maintaining order and occupy Vietnam. Then the real danger will arrive. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - Thai Prime Minister Songgram spoke at the closing of the National Assembly yesterday, saying that the situation in Thailand and Vietnam is quite tense, but not serious. Thailand's financial and economic situation is quite satisfactory, and its relations with other countries are also good. However, France does not yet understand Thailand's intentions. The Prime Minister asked the delegates to convey to their respective districts that the situation in the country is not serious, but the government will never allow France to infringe upon the sovereignty of the country.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e14">Society's View of the Municipal Council and Chinese Police <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>"If the public wants to obtain full and effective police protection, then it should be prepared to pay those who risk their lives to maintain peace and order," it is said that this was the explanation given by the responsible official of the Police Department after the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council approved a 150% increase in the treatment of Chinese police officers in the concession, fearing that the taxpayers' burden would increase dramatically. Therefore, the public should not misunderstand this, thinking that the police officers regard the so-called protection as a commodity and sell it to the public at a price, and that better protection will be regarded as a higher commodity, demanding a greater price from the public; nor should there be any doubt, thinking that the protection received in the past has already been commensurate with the price paid in the past, and that the perceived lack of protection is due to the excessively low price. The public must distinguish three points: first, paying a certain price to get a certain amount of protection is a general principle between the public and the administration, which is fair and unassailable; if it is heard in the political classroom, it will also be happily accepted by the students; justice is where it is, regardless of who says it. Second, taking Shanghai as an example, the taxpayers are the ones who pay the price, and the Municipal Council is the one who is responsible; whether the taxpayers are satisfied or not with the protection they receive, whether the price they pay is too high or not, whether the price and the protection are commensurate or not, this must be resolved between the taxpayers and the Municipal Council, the problem is not with the police authorities. Third, the police authorities, in their capacity as public servants and in the spirit of public service, must not care about the price paid by the public and must strive to exert their highest and best abilities; the public can only judge based on their actual performance, proving that they have the power to achieve full and effective results. As for increasing the treatment of Chinese police officers, one reason is that prices have soared and the original salary is absolutely insufficient to maintain a living; another reason is that within the same organization, the treatment of Chinese police officers is uniquely meager, sharing the same dangers but not sharing the same joys and sorrows, which violates justice and administrative principles; increasing the treatment of Chinese police officers is based on these two extremely serious reasons, but has nothing to do with the so-called "if you want a certain amount of protection, you must pay a certain price." Recognizing these limits and boundaries, we can begin to discuss the matter on its own merits. Let us say a few more words.</p>
<p>The current issue: After the Chinese police officers' treatment has been increased, it is said that the Municipal Council's monthly expenditure has increased by 700,000 yuan, which is a very large amount and has become a problem in itself. Considering that the Municipal Council increased various tax rates starting in the autumn of this year, i.e., July, taking the house tax as an example, the autumn receipts totaled 5.92 million yuan, an increase of 2.9 million yuan compared to the 3.02 million yuan in the autumn of last year, i.e., a monthly increase of 967,000 yuan; other tax receipts are not included. We cannot simply say that this is enough to cover the increased salaries of the Chinese police officers. However, it must be said that the burden on the citizens is already heavy. It is the inescapable duty of the citizens to bear the municipal expenses, but it is necessary to review the achievements of the Municipal Council at the same time. Let us take one example: within the concession, i.e., under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council, how many residents are there, how much food is stored, how much is imported each month, what is the cost price each time, and what percentage of the stock is held by rice merchants and hoarders? The high price of rice is now the main reason for the high price of everything, and the high price of everything is also the main reason for threatening the security of the concession; what measures has the Municipal Council taken to address this situation, and what results have been achieved? If you say that there is manipulation and monopoly, why allow manipulation and monopoly? If you say that is not the case, why is rice so expensive? We believe that whether it is indulging rice weevils and rice villains, or watching legitimate merchants being falsely accused of being weevils and villains, or even the high price of rice or the lack of grain, the Municipal Council has been too inactive! What do the citizens feel? They only feel that petty offenses are not allowed, but open extortion is allowed, binding the citizens' mouths and stomachs, and forcing them to redeem them in small amounts! The burden on the citizens is already heavy, and what they encounter and feel is like this, how can we not hope that the Municipal Council will do better?</p>
<p>Another current issue: After improving the treatment of Chinese police officers, the overall goal is to launch a welfare campaign for Chinese police officers. Undoubtedly, this campaign is worth advocating, and we hope that all [unclear] will work together to make it a success. The scope of welfare for police officers is quite broad, and we have not yet had the opportunity to learn what is planned to be launched. But generally speaking, in addition to the various necessary equipment and measures that the police authorities must provide for their personnel, society, for the welfare of Chinese police officers and also for the welfare of the citizens, should focus on Shanghai's situation and make great efforts from the sidelines: first, regarding the organization of consumer cooperatives, it is still difficult to expect Chinese police officers to adopt cooperative methods consciously and spontaneously; how should all parties in society provide assistance in terms of material resources and intelligence; and various industries related to Chinese police officers' consumption should each provide convenience to the Chinese police officers' cooperative organizations. Second, regarding spiritual assistance; this does not mean recruiting Chinese police officers to attend lectures in addition to receiving training from the police department and working hard, but focusing on their spare time, choosing what is necessary, and providing opportunities for them to automatically absorb the spirit of progress under various relaxed and reasonable methods, in order to directly relieve their depression and confusion. Indirectly emphasize their service functions. Third, regarding the promotion of social awards: the police department has its own reward and punishment regulations, which outsiders do not want to hear about; however, there are also those who sacrifice or are injured for public service, and the compensation received from the police department is not enough to compensate for their losses; how should society establish methods, give preferential awards, and ensure that Chinese police officers who work hard to serve the public will receive superior comfort in terms of reputation and full protection in terms of economy in case of any accident; this is to extend social justice, express social sympathy, and also to improve their belief in serving the public. The realization of these three points, I believe, will enable the Chinese police officers to truly enjoy their welfare, and what they create for society will be considerable!</p>
<h3 id="e15">Matsuoka Delivers a Speech: Hopes for Understanding Between the US and Japan; Japan Will Not Participate If Germany Attacks the US; Refuses to Discuss Relations with the Soviet Union <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka, since taking office in July, received foreign press reporters today for the first time. He stated that war between the US and Japan would be extremely foolish. Even if both the US and Germany were simultaneously involved in a war, the question of who the aggressor is and whether Japan has obligations under Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact would arise. Japan has no territorial ambitions anywhere in East Asia. Japan's ultimate goal for the Dutch East Indies is genuine understanding. Regarding Japanese-Soviet negotiations, he hopes to persuade Moscow to acknowledge that recognizing the Nanjing regime will not harm Japanese-Soviet relations. If Germany attacks the US, Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact will not be implemented. If the situation falls within the scope of the treaty, each signatory should make independent judgments and then discuss the matter together. He hopes this situation will not occur. A reporter asked for his opinion on the future relations between the US and Japan. Matsuoka replied that although they may have different opinions, as everyone knows, there is no reason for war if they do not infringe upon each other. He hopes that the US and Japan will have the best possible understanding in the near future. Matsuoka refused to discuss the progress of negotiations between Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa and the Soviet authorities in Moscow, but stated that the Tripartite Pact is completely unrelated to the Soviet Union. Japan's ultimate goal is to establish genuine understanding with the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, etc. Someone asked if Mr. Arita's current state of Pacific defense remains unchanged. Matsuoka replied that maintaining the status quo is almost impossible in today's rapidly changing world. Japan has no intention of hindering change. Matsuoka also said that the possibility of US warships using Singapore as a base would be an immediate concern for Japan, but there is no evidence of this happening at present. The Nanjing treaty does not close the door to reconciliation with Chongqing, but this peace is already somewhat distant. Any contact with Chongqing has been left to Nanjing to handle. US loans to Chongqing prolong the conflict and are regrettable, but Japan has no reason to change its China policy to please the US because it believes that what it is doing is right. Matsuoka reiterated that Japan's war is not to oppress China, and that if it were, he himself would oppose it. Although there may still be misunderstandings overseas, he believes that the legitimacy of Japan's war will soon be proven. Currently, there is an effort in Japan to oppose the West's conquest, greed, oppression, and exploitation of weak nations. If the US understands that Japan opposes such tactics, all disputes will naturally be resolved. Matsuoka finally asked if anyone could tell him whether the US would participate in the war, saying that it was a major question because the fate of humanity depended on it. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, the Japan National Newspaper stated that the US is the only country hindering Japan from building a new order in Asia. The US's anti-Japanese attitude is becoming increasingly apparent. A strong public opinion is gradually emerging in Japan, demanding a firm attitude towards the US. It also stated that US public opinion has failed to value Japan's dispatch of Nomura as ambassador to improve US-Japan relations. Furthermore, the Hochi Shimbun advocated for the rapid adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations to offset the anti-Japanese tactics of Britain and the US. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>

<p>Havana: According to news arriving here this morning, a German freighter, the "Idarwald," attempted to break through the British blockade line yesterday and was unfortunately sunk by a British warship with torpedoes and shells within the Pan-American neutrality zone off the southern coast of Cuba. The "Idarwald" and another German freighter, the "Rhein," left Tampico together ten days ago. Both ships attempted to pass through the Caribbean Sea between Cuba and Jamaica and were overtaken by a British warship at that time, seemingly a cruiser. Cuban warships searched the sea last night, attempting to find the British warship and any survivors. Only fragmented information is available regarding this matter, and details are not yet known. Two Cuban warships, departing from the Cuban naval base, seemed to have witnessed part of the naval battle. The two ships received a distress signal from the German freighter, stating that its sailors were abandoning the ship. (International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington: A US neutrality patrol destroyer, after patrolling, informed the Navy Department that a German freighter, the "Idarwald," was intercepted by a British cruiser off the southern coast of Cuba this morning. It is reported that the German ship's sailors intended to scuttle the ship, but the plan was not completed. Sailors from the British cruiser boarded the German ship. It is said that the British cruiser requested the assistance of the US patrol destroyer. It was not revealed whether the "Idarwald" was bombarded or hit by a torpedo.

<p>Buenos Aires: According to an unconfirmed report from the Crítica's correspondent in Montevideo, a German cruiser, which reportedly destroyed the British auxiliary cruiser "Carnarvon Castle" in a naval battle off the coast of Brazil on Saturday, was chased by the British cruiser "Enterprise" yesterday. The same report stated that the "Enterprise" engaged the German ship in the Atlantic and destroyed it. Further details are unknown. The news of this alleged naval battle has not been confirmed as of today. (International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Montevideo: The British auxiliary cruiser "Carnarvon Castle" has had its stay here extended to 72 hours. The Uruguayan government's decision to extend the deadline was based on the report of the technical committee, which proved that the ship had been hit by 22 shells, the engine room was partially destroyed, and the kitchen was completely destroyed. The ship carries sailors from the auxiliary cruiser "Queen of Bermuda," who will likely fill the ship's vacancies. Hundreds of workers are currently repairing the ship, preparing it to be stationed in the Falkland Islands. A full inspection will be carried out. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Montevideo: Locals speculate that the German envoy will visit the Uruguayan Foreign Minister to state that, according to the convention of international law, prisoners on warships of belligerent countries are expected to regain their freedom when they arrive at neutral ports. Therefore, since the British auxiliary cruiser "Carnarvon Castle" is now berthed in a neutral port, the Uruguayan government may negotiate with the British warship to release the 22 German prisoners on board.

<p>Tokyo: It has been learned today that after a meeting of officials from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Railways, and Ministry of Communications, the government has tentatively decided to use Tokyo as a commercial port based on the harbor improvement plan passed by the Ministry of Home Affairs' harbor engineers on November 18. If there are no obstacles, the cabinet will formally decide on the details of this plan within this week. It is heard that the government is handling this matter very cautiously to ensure that Yokohama's prosperity is not hindered as a result, as the people of Yokohama strongly oppose it. The government has indicated its approach as follows: (1) Tokyo is not an independent port but an extension of the Yokohama port to Tokyo; (2) Foreign ships can sail into Yokohama; (3) Japanese ships can enter both Yokohama and Tokyo. It is also heard that foreign trade will use Yokohama as a port, while Tokyo will serve the trade of Japan's affiliated countries. At the same time, the Yokohama City Council convened a meeting on December 7 and passed a resolution opposing the opening of Tokyo as a commercial port. Yesterday, a citizens' meeting was convened, attended by 2,000 representatives from various groups, passing a resolution denouncing the government's plan, pointing out that the government's move will make it impossible for Yokohama's million people to make a living. The issue of Tokyo's commercial port has been delayed since 1932 due to Yokohama's opposition. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Belgrade: Regarding the relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia, official sources here have recently commented that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky is scheduled to visit here on the 11th and 12th of this month to meet with Yugoslav authorities. It is expected that a treaty of friendship between the two countries will be signed at that time, the content of which will be no different from that signed by Yugoslavia with Bulgaria in 1937. Responsible figures say that Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact with Germany, Italy, and Japan last month, coupled with its treaty with Yugoslavia, has implications that extend beyond the current relationship between the two countries. In short, Yugoslavia seems to be indirectly approaching the Axis powers. For this reason, the restoration of friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia is nothing less than the beginning of a new diplomatic initiative by Germany in Southeast Europe, the ultimate goal of which remains to promote the accession of all Balkan countries to the "New European Order." Once Yugoslavia recognizes the status quo in Europe created by the current European war, Germany will presumably offer a promise to guarantee Yugoslavia's territorial integrity in order to conclude the first step of this new diplomatic initiative. As for Yugoslavia, it seems to have a clear plan for joining the "New European Order," as can be seen from the speech delivered by Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković yesterday. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">German Aircraft in Batches Attack England Overnight; London Suffers Unprecedented Devastation; Various Bombs Dropped, Fires Rage Everywhere; Heavy Material Damage, Deaths, and Injuries <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>London: Last night and this morning, London was shaken by the most intense air raid since the start of the war. German aircraft flying at low altitude dropped large numbers of incendiary and explosive bombs in batches towards the center of London and its four suburbs, like a rushing torrent. This offensive, comparable to the Coventry air raid, was apparently intended to retaliate for the British Air Force's attacks on Düsseldorf, Brest, and other German cities on Saturday night. As dusk approached, German Air Force giant aircraft, after ending their 44-hour silence, continuously and fiercely pounced on London in batches. At the same time, British anti-aircraft guns roared non-stop, and British Air Force fighters also assisted the anti-aircraft gun teams in the skies over London, engaging the invaders. German aircraft blindly bombed the entire city, and buildings and houses were destroyed. London citizens, having fallen into a false sense of security due to the long period without air raids, were suddenly attacked by the German Air Force in the streets. It is feared that there will be many deaths and injuries. Many large hotels and apartments were directly hit by bombs and destroyed, and most of the construction work already in progress was also damaged. With the help of flares and a bright half-moon, the German Air Force dropped various types of bombs, including new "Molotov breadbasket" explosives, which scattered bombs upon impact, like Chinese firecrackers. This weapon was first used by the Soviet army in the Soviet-Finnish War. International News Agency reporters Smith and Mueller almost lost their lives on the way to the agency. They tried to dodge in street corners all the way, when a violent explosion came, knocking them to the ground. A bomb landed next to them (in the place where they had taken shelter a few minutes ago). Many newspaper buildings and their equipment on Fleet Street were destroyed by bombs. The German Air Force's offensive seemed to slacken slightly at midnight because fierce anti-aircraft fire had driven the invaders away from their targets. German giant cannons on the French coast also bombarded the Dover coastal area. (International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military communique stated that German aircraft bombed London continuously from dusk to dawn the previous night. London's main warehouses were heavily bombed. Many of the most important bombs were dropped, causing large fires in several places. Gasoline pools caught fire, and a gas plant exploded. Last night, British aircraft invaded German territory. Houses in Düsseldorf, Mönchengladbach, and other places were hit by bombs and caught fire. Nine civilians were killed, seventeen were seriously injured, and twenty-four were slightly injured, but military facilities were undamaged. German anti-aircraft guns shot down two British aircraft, and one German aircraft went missing. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources that German aircraft dropped no less than 700 tons of bombs and 80,000-90,000 incendiary bombs while bombing London last night and this morning, setting an unprecedented record. The previous night with the most bombs dropped was 503 tons. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, the German Air Force again concentrated its efforts on air raids on London. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and two German aircraft were reportedly hit and destroyed. Fires broke out in many places, and buildings were damaged considerably. There were some casualties among residents. Bombs also landed in many places between London and the southeast coast, causing some damage to houses and other property. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: The day and night before and yesterday, no enemy aircraft were seen in London. This was the longest period of tranquility that London citizens had experienced since the German side launched its aerial blitzkrieg on August 7. The alert was only issued again when dusk fell last night. The Ministry of Aviation issued the simplest communique, stating that a German fighter-bomber was shot down in the English Channel yesterday afternoon, and there was nothing else to report. According to midnight news, German aircraft were rampaging again last night, concentrating their attacks on London. Enemy bombers sometimes came individually and sometimes in teams of three or four, flying to various districts of London. High-explosive bombs were dropped. Enemy aircraft first released flares in circles in a certain area and then dropped bombs inside the circles. So far, there have been no reports of significant casualties. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>London: Officials announced last night the circumstances of the British aircraft's attack on the French Atlantic coast ports of Brest and Lorient when the German Air Force rested on Saturday night. It is said that Brest suffered the most severe attack that night, fires broke out around the naval school, and soon after, the power plant exploded like thunder. A British aircraft spotter said that Brest looked like a furnace when it was attacked, with thick smoke and rubble flying everywhere, and the infantry and naval barracks and the buildings between the two barracks were hit by incendiary and high-explosive bombs.

<p>London: General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French Forces, broadcasted last night to the French forces in Syria and North Africa, urging the French army and navy in North Africa and Syria not to lose the opportunity to strike the exhausted Italian army and completely defeat them, so as to win the opportunity for France to win in the Mediterranean. He said that all generals, soldiers, and officers of the army, navy, and air force in French colonies should unite with the Free French Forces and continue to fight together with the Allies to seek the liberation of France. The current situation has given the French army an excellent opportunity to rejoin the war and win the final victory. France is now secretly plotting to unite again to resist the enemy and refuses to cooperate with Germany. Soon several more French warships will enter the service of the Free French Navy. General de Gaulle recently inspected these French warships, destroyers, submarines, mine-laying ships, and patrol boats at a naval base in the UK. General de Gaulle also inspected a training ship, which is now serving as a Free French Navy Academy to train naval officers.

<p>Athens: The Greek High Command officially announced yesterday the complete capture of Argyrokastron, a major stronghold in Albania. The town was the main target of the Greek forces after the fall of Korçë. It is said that the lower part of Albania is now entirely under the control of the Greek forces. On the northern front, the Greek mountain warriors are reportedly advancing in two directions, less than eighteen miles from Argirokastro. Argirokastro is the gateway to the Albanian capital, Tirana. On the southern front, the Greek forces are said to have seized a large quantity of military supplies and captured hundreds of prisoners from the Italian forces. It is also reported that the majority of the 11,000 residents of Argyrokastron welcomed the Greek forces with loud cheers. Greek sources say that the fires set by the retreating Italian troops were extinguished by the Greek fire brigade. At the same time, it is reported that the Greek left wing, currently near Sarandë, is pursuing and pressing the Italian forces retreating towards Himarë. It is reported that the Italian forces are attempting to establish a defensive position at Palermo, six miles south of Himarë, but other Greek columns on the right wing are advancing towards Tepelenë and Përmet, threatening to encircle several thousand Italian troops attempting to establish a new defensive line in this area. (International, 9th)</p>
<p>Argyrokastron: The battle of Argyrokastron ended at noon yesterday when the last position of the Italian forces in the area was taken. The Italian forces used heavy tanks to block the narrow streets of the city, but eventually retreated to their final position in the city center. Greek troops captured one position after another, attacking the Italian tanks with what seemed like madness, aiming rifles at the drivers of the tanks and firing rapidly. Some Greek soldiers also threw hand grenades into the tank openings. The Italian tanks between the buildings were heavily attacked by Greek artillery. The final assault began at dawn, with Greek artillery teams in the surrounding mountains fiercely bombarding the Italian forces holding the main roads. A reporter witnessed a roof being destroyed by Greek artillery fire and the Italian troops fleeing. (United Press, Argyrokastron Correspondent, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: After the official announcement of the Greek capture of Argyrokastron and its surrounding lands, the people here held enthusiastic celebrations. They also learned that the Greek soldiers had advanced northward from this important city in southern Albania. It is reported that the Greek forces are currently pursuing the routed Italian troops, and their advance is so rapid that it is difficult for their supply lines to keep up. In the northern area, despite the obstacles of terrain and climate, the Greek forces have crossed the mountain ranges and are approaching Argirokastro, cutting off the enemy's retreat. It is also reported that a Greek unit has entered a village only eight miles from Argirokastro. Argirokastro is an extremely important central city in Albania, located south of Tirana, only twenty-four miles from the capital. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>London: According to a Reuters correspondent at the Yugoslav-Albanian border, the main force of the Italian army in Albania is currently retreating towards Argirokastro. Greek troops have occupied the village of Radomickë, the last stronghold of Italian resistance in front of Lian, and one of the important strongholds in the northern area. The Italian forces are desperately trying to prevent the Greek forces from breaking through to the road west of Lian and Argirokastro, so fierce hand-to-hand combat has broken out between the two sides, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Fierce battles are also taking place on the high ground from Lian to Leshnicë. If the Greek forces can capture Leshnicë, they can reach Kukës and Argirokastro. The Greek forces have begun a fierce attack on these two areas of high ground. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: Last night, the whole of Greece celebrated throughout the night, recognizing the occupation of Argyrokastron as the greatest Greek victory since the start of the Greek-Italian conflict. The Greek High Command announced that the Greek forces now hold one-seventh of Albanian territory and have liberated one-quarter of the Albanian population, freeing them from Italian rule. Recent Greek communiqués stated that the Greek forces had achieved new victories in attacks on all fronts last night, seizing new strategic positions. It is said that the road from Pogradec to Argyrokastron, a vital supply line for the Italian forces, is now partially in Greek hands. On the northern front, two Greek columns are advancing west and north of Pogradec to encircle the defeated Italian forces. According to reports, the lead elements of the Greek forces have already crossed the river near the source of the Shkumbin River and are advancing westward along the riverbank, threatening the left flank and rear of the Italian line. The roads to Tirana and Durrës converge at Argirokastro, making the position of Argirokastro extremely important. It is reported that the elite Italian Alpini troops are fiercely resisting the Greek forces, and Italian reinforcements are rushing to the area. It is also reported that another Greek column is advancing west of Korçë along a road parallel to the Devoll River, which runs from south to Argirokastro. The objective of these multiple Greek advances is to threaten the Albanian oil fields between the Devoll and Shkumbin rivers, which are the only natural petroleum resources owned by the Italian Fascist Party. It is also reported that on the road to Argyrokastron, after two hours of fierce fighting, the Greek forces defeated the last Italian rearguard. The Greek forces immediately used the large quantities of weapons and ammunition captured in Argyrokastron and advanced further north, occupying new high ground and villages.

<p>A Glorious Page in Greek Military History: Athens Celebrates Triumphantly</p>
<p>Athens: The official announcement of the capture of the important Albanian stronghold of Argyrokastron has sparked the most fervent celebrations among the Greek people. Greek flags are flying throughout the city of Athens. On every street, British and Scottish soldiers are holding hands with Greeks, jumping and dancing. The national anthems of Greece and Britain are being played, shaking the whole city. King George II of Greece appeared on the balcony of the General Headquarters, waving to the crowds to celebrate the third victory in two weeks. Reports from Argyrokastron state that the most famous Greek troops stormed the narrow streets of the city, fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets. After a long street battle in front of the city hall with the Italian "Suicide Squad", the city was finally occupied. When the news arrived, church bells rang loudly, and people gathered in the streets in the moonlight, tearing down the glorious Greek flag on the Acropolis hill and raising it in the streets.

<p>Rapid Progress on All Fronts: Greek Prime Minister Commends the Three Armed Forces</p>
<p>Athens: Today, Greece is enthusiastically celebrating the capture of Argyrokastron. The Greek forces are now continuing their work of driving the Italian troops into the sea. According to recent communiqués, the Greek forces have won victories on all fronts, resulting in the occupation of several important positions in Albanian territory. It is widely rumored that the Greek forces have crossed the Drin River and are advancing. The Italian forces continue to retreat along the entire line. It is heard that the Greek forces on the northern coast have occupied a village of great military importance. The Italian forces put up fierce resistance in heavy rain. After receiving news of the capture of Argyrokastron, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas sent telegrams to commend the entire army. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Greek Generals Issue Commands from High in the Mountains</p>
<p>Albanian Battlefield: From this small fortress on the mountain ridge, resembling an eagle's nest, the command of the Greek division directed the glorious battle of the attack on Argyrokastron. Looking down the mountain, the main road meandered through the valley, surrounded by snow-capped mountains that reached into the clouds. This humble cottage, constructed of several stone rooms on the rocky mountainside, was almost invisible from the air. Inside, officers used high-powered telescopes to observe small battles on the opposite mountain. Greek soldiers were seen waving flags to report on the situation below. Large logs burned in the room, the fire blazing. Telephones were arranged like a battle line, with wires like nets. Another inner room contained a wireless radio, constantly transmitting new orders. This reporter waited six hours before sending this dispatch because Italian forces had blown up a stone bridge, and Greek forces had to build a wooden bridge across the flooded river before transportation could pass. The mountain road was filled with horses and mule trains, with mud deep enough to reach the ankles. Newly painted Greek insignias on captured Italian vehicles rumbled past us, forcing us to step off the road and wait. The reporter passed numerous Greek mountain artillery teams accurately firing, pursuing the remnants of the Italian forces in Argyrokastron from high up. The reporter also saw soldiers on the mountainside heading towards the Argyrokastron area, where hand-to-hand combat would be required, and artillery would be useless. The reporter was no more than six hundred yards from the Greek vanguard. The sound of machine guns was very dense, but details of the front line were still unclear. The main force of the Italian troops had clearly withdrawn from Argyrokastron, leaving only a rearguard to resist the pursuers. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Heavy Fighting on the Northern Front as Armies Contest the Gates of Argirokastro</p>
<p>Capital of Southern Country: According to news from the Albanian front, the Italian and Greek armies are engaged in extremely fierce fighting north of Pogradec, contesting the village of Radomickë. The village is the gateway to the Argirokastro highway. The Italian forces have established strong defenses. The Greek forces actively advanced yesterday and reached the outskirts of the village, but suffered heavy losses. The Greek forces launched a heavy attack on the high ground west of Pogradec yesterday, attempting to link up the northern and southern Greek forces. According to news from Athens, the Greek forces have not yet occupied Argyrokastron because the city is currently in flames, but the Greek forces have encircled it. The Greek Minister of Economy, Klimbas, visited Korçë on the 7th and allocated one million Greek drachmas (equivalent to one franc) to aid civilians. The city lacks food. Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas has ordered food to be transported to Korçë. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Milan: According to this morning's "Popolo d'Italia", fierce fighting is taking place on the left wing of the Italian positions in the Pogradec mountain area. The Greek forces have brought up a large number of reinforcements and have gained some local victories. The Italian forces are putting up strong resistance. The Italian air force has also participated in the battle. Although the weather is terrible, and fighting in the snow and ice is extremely difficult, the Italian forces have sent planes to bomb various Greek positions. Greek ammunition depots near Esaki have been hit by Italian bombs. (Haitong, 9th)</p>

Our forces also carried out counterattacks, which proceeded smoothly. The Italian Eleventh Army has now carried out an orderly withdrawal and is firmly holding new positions north of Argyrokastron. Although the weather is terrible, our air force is still active, bombing military targets in Mara and Ada Bay. In North Africa, our artillery fired on enemy motorized units southeast of Rabia. Enemy aircraft bombed Chochalesi and Dachna, killing one civilian and injuring five, with minor material damage. (Haitong, 9th)</p>

The British aircraft also braved bad weather and resisted attacks from large formations of enemy fighters, attacking the port of Vlorë in Albania. All bombs hit the target area, but the results are unknown. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>British and Greek Troops Fighting Side by Side: A Sketch of Battlefield Life</p>
<p>Greek Front: The Greek army is continuing to advance across this vast battlefield of 125 miles, now 50 miles deep into the Morava Mountains near Lake Ohrid. The area seized by the Greek army from the Italian army is nearly a quarter of Albanian territory. The total area of Albania is 17,500 square miles, and 4,000 square miles have been captured by the Greek army. As the reporter followed the army to the Pogradec highland area, the northeastern side of the Greek line, he heard Greek and British soldiers singing the "Tipperary" war song. Although this is an old march, it has been given a new look, because they are singing not about going to "Tipperary", but about going to "Tirana". One of the singing soldiers told the reporter that he served in the British army during the previous World War, so he sang the "Tipperary" song to prove it. In addition to carrying rifles, the Greek soldiers also carry hay for the mules and horses to eat, and a blanket to wrap around their heads to ward off the cold. However, they do not carry gas masks. The Greek soldiers' diet usually consists of black bread and rice cooked with mutton fat. They cherish every good meal and consider themselves lucky. The Greek soldiers eat Aleboudi, while the British soldiers eat chocolate and jam. Beef, wine, and cigarettes are extremely scarce. Between Korçë and the front line, the reporter only occasionally encountered some ragged old women amidst the sound of artillery fire. Many young women had fled into the mountains when their husbands took up arms to attack the Italians. The cafes in the villages near the front line often have a radio. Greek soldiers often listen to the BBC's Greek language broadcasts to learn about the war news. The Greek soldiers are very enthusiastic about everything. (United Press, 9th)</p>

At the same time, Cavallero replied to Prime Minister Mussolini, vowing to do his utmost to achieve final victory. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to news arriving here today, Italian Commander-in-Chief of the Invasion of Ethiopia, General Graziani, has submitted his resignation, but this news could not be confirmed. It is heard that Mussolini has refused to accept Graziani's resignation request. It is rumored that Graziani's resignation was submitted after the demotion of Italian Chief of Staff Badoglio. (International News Service, 9th) Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday continued to reorganize the highest generals of the Fascist military leadership with vigorous steps. The major changes in the past three days aim to instill new-style blitzkrieg tactics into the commanders, so that they can take the offensive in Albania and Africa. The new Navy Commander, Riccardi, after taking over the vacancy left by former Commander Cavagnari yesterday, will intensify cooperation between the Italian Navy and Air Force to deal with the Greek forces. (According to London, Mussolini is sweeping away all the highest generals to cultivate Fascist ideas in the army and navy.) A special communiqué from the Italian government stated that Navy Commander Cavagnari's "voluntary resignation" was due to a sincere letter from Mussolini, which stated, "I am extremely pleased with Your Excellency's hard work in developing the Italian Navy over the past seven years," and so on. Cavagnari had participated in the Boxer Rebellion and the invasion of Beijing. During the Shanghai conflict in 1932, he also came to Shanghai on the "Salerno" warship. He returned to Italy the following year. Also, there were two minor changes in the Italian Navy command yesterday. One was the promotion of Commander Campioni to Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, and the other was the appointment of Commander Iachino as Commander of Italian warships at sea. This change in naval personnel, following the removal of Army Chief of Staff Badoglio and Dodecanese Governor De Vecchi, is of great significance. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: There were also transfers of Italian naval personnel yesterday. This may be a prelude to the Italian fleet engaging in a contest with the British fleet. The conservative Italian Chief of Naval Staff, General Cavagnari, has been replaced by the activist Admiral Riccardi, who is known for advocating joint operations between aircraft and warships. (International, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: The new Italian Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Riccardi, is 62 years old and was born in Pavia, near Milan. He was appointed a senator in 1939. After becoming Chief of Staff, he will also serve concurrently as Undersecretary of the Navy. (Haitong, 9th)</p>

<p>Washington: The United States has agreed to sell the first thirty Curtiss destroyers to Greece. Informed sources believe that this move is the United States quickly implementing its policy of aiding countries at war who have been invaded. It is revealed that some of these thirty Curtiss aircraft originally belonged to the United States itself, while others were intended to be transported to Britain, but if London agrees, these aircraft will be transported to Greece. After the Greek government requested the United States to supply aircraft and other aid, the United States immediately followed up with aid to Greece. U.S. government officials revealed that the Greek requests would be given sympathetic consideration. Observers here believe that U.S. aid to Greece will not be limited to thirty Curtiss aircraft. Military experts say that the Italian-Greek war has reached a decisive stage, and express their opinion that if Britain and Greece launch a fierce attack on Albania, followed by an attack on Italy, the southern end of the Axis powers will be cut off. Observers believe that the battles on the mountains and plains of Albania are no less important than the battles on the banks of the Thames. The future of Europe and the world rests on this.

<p>— Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Secrets to Maintaining Health During Youth</p>
<p>Seventeen and eighteen-year-old youths, because of their physiological maturity, begin to leave behind the innocence of childhood and enter the beginning of life. If they contract common illnesses during this period, or engage in behaviors that harm their body and mind, the consequences can affect their happiness for life. Moreover, a youth's most precious virginity is often lost to sexual urges at this time, leading to immense troubles. The most common of these is indulging in masturbation, depleting their essence and exhausting their brain, casting a dark shadow on the bright path of life. This is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Masturbation is almost unavoidable for boys during adolescence because their sexual urges are at their strongest at this time. Therefore, they focus on the opposite sex, indulging in fantasies, which in turn triggers the urge to masturbate.</p>
<p>After excessive masturbation, the first symptom to appear is frequent seminal emission. This condition can be considered a sign of neurasthenia. The only way to treat it is to first completely stop masturbating, then strictly adhere to health maintenance, taking a warm water sitz bath for half an hour every day, and massaging the area with cold water. These methods are quite effective, but they only serve as an auxiliary treatment. It is also necessary to take three "Nels Seminal Emission Tablets" before bed every day to strengthen the seminal gate and eliminate the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation mechanism. The effect is indeed better than any other sperm-strengthening pills. If a person suffering from frequent nocturnal emissions is left untreated, it often leads to sexual dysfunction, such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and penile atrophy. Treatment then becomes more difficult, requiring active administration of testicular endocrine therapy to restore energy and enhance sexual power.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I must use my thirty years of clinical experience to explain the efficacy of the truly high-quality testicular essence preparation for men, "Butaikang," which is unanimously praised by modern medical scientists for treating this condition.</p>
<p>The reason why "Butaikang" is so effective in treating premature ejaculation and penile atrophy is solely due to its lasting vigor. This is attributed to the meticulous and comprehensive extraction process, which preserves the precious elements. Although patients with mild symptoms experience miraculous effects after taking just one bottle, according to my experience as a doctor, it is necessary to take three bottles consecutively and strictly adhere to health maintenance to completely cure the chronic disease without any problems. I sincerely advise masturbation sufferers that if they feel a decline in brainpower, sexual power, or physical strength, then "Butaikang" for men is definitely worth a try.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Case of Cured Limb Coldness <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Patient Yu Chengda, 37 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, residing at No. 2, Yong'an Lane, Sanban Factory, this city (self-report): "I was born with congenital deficiency. I also had seminal emissions before marriage. After marriage, I felt kidney deficiency. After the age of 30, I became increasingly spiritless. I felt lower back pain and backache even after sitting for a short time. From the age of 35, I would tremble all over and my limbs would be ice-cold whenever the seasons changed, making it impossible to get out of bed. The signs of aging are disheartening. I beg for treatment, etc." (Symptoms upon examination): "Weight 95 pounds, pale complexion, chronically suffering from insomnia. Although sexual activity is not excessive, premature ejaculation is severe, indicating a deficiency in both blood and kidneys, resulting in premature aging." (Treatment process): "Instructed him to engage in exercise, refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol, and take three "Butaikang" testicular essence tablets for men three times a day during the day. After taking the medication, he immediately felt a great boost in spirit, and symptoms such as lower back pain, backache, and cold limbs were completely cured. This is because "Butaikang" functions to promote metabolism, eliminate neurasthenia, nourish the brain, nourish the kidneys, replenish blood, and promote the development of reproductive organs, making it quite suitable for the condition. Mr. Yu took the medication continuously for two months, and the aforementioned symptoms were completely cured. His weight has increased by seven pounds. He was examined for sexual function. He stopped taking the medication at the end of last month, and his weight reached 110 pounds, his complexion is rosy, and his appetite has increased. In the past, Mr. Yu would experience cold limbs every autumn and winter, but even in the harsh winter now, he does not feel cold."</p>

<h3 id="e50">A Chronicle of the Last Days of Warsaw <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>A woman sits on the ground, peeling sweet potatoes. A young girl, old enough to wear a hairpin, applies makeup in front of a mirror next to her bombed-out apartment. Two boys read a Mickey Mouse comic strip from a Polish newspaper. Fourteen dead horses lie scattered on the road, and members of the volunteer team are carrying lime to cover them. Twenty feet away, there are ten more corpses. These ten people had sought refuge in a cave but still could not escape death. Nearby, a boy wanders aimlessly, carrying a birdcage with a canary inside.</p>
<p>A certain area was completely devastated by bombing, with not a single building intact. Everywhere you look, you see crowds of residents, some walking, some riding bicycles, and some pushing carts and baby carriages, loaded with bedding and a small amount of food, having lost their homes and scattered to find shelter. Every night at 9:30 PM, German bombers fly over and wreak havoc, intensifying as time goes on. By dawn, another part of Warsaw has been destroyed. Citizens without homes flock to other parts of the city, seeking any place to stay. Rich and poor mingle, without regard to status, and money is useless.</p>
<p>Initially, Warsaw was only bombed. By September 13th, the city center was within range of the German artillery. German planes circled overhead, directing the artillery to bombard the streets. The shells exploded in the air, and those hit by the shrapnel were either killed or injured, without exception.</p>
<p>Around September 17th, the German army began a fierce artillery bombardment, with 10,000 to 30,000 shells falling on Warsaw every day, making it dangerous to walk in the open. Even the anti-aircraft teams could not abandon their work. Later, the air raid sirens stopped sounding, and warnings of impending bombardment could only be heard on the radio.</p>
<p>The shelling was most intense at night, and every morning hundreds of corpses were found in the streets, buried on the side of the road or in nearby parks. The number of German cannons increased daily, and the bombardment lasted for six brutal days. By the end of the bombardment, there was not a single intact glass window in Warsaw.</p>
<p>I stood in the garden of the American Embassy and saw a German bomber shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Fortunately, I had a camera with me and was able to photograph the scene of the German plane catching fire and crashing.</p>
<p>After the German plane crashed, I rushed to the scene and saw the wreckage of the plane still smoking. All four crew members were dead. As a human being, I should have felt sad about the plane crashing with its crew, as it is human nature to do so. However, I actually cheered and shouted with two other American expatriates. We had forgotten the families of the German pilots, and only recognized that these pilots represented the German government that had been massacring innocent people for the past three weeks. Therefore, we could not help but rejoice at the death of the pilots. This is how war affects people's hearts.</p>
<p>September 16th was the Jewish New Year. That night, German planes flew over and dropped many incendiary bombs on the Jewish quarter of Warsaw, causing fires, with flying embers stinging both eyes. Walls collapsed, a shocking sight. Within three hours, twenty square buildings had been reduced to rubble. That night, thousands were left homeless, the injured could not be rescued, and the corpses could not be removed.</p>
<p>When Warsaw was besieged, the front lines were at the edge of the city. Polish soldiers returned to the city from the front lines every day to collect food for their families, at least to see that their families had food and were safe, and then return to the front lines with peace of mind. More civilians died than soldiers, so husbands fighting on the front lines were less concerned about their own survival than about whether their families were still alive at home.</p>
<p>Day after day, the danger intensified, and it was not easy for me to remain a bystander to the tragedy. On September 15th, Polish officials asked me to broadcast in English on Warsaw Radio for ten minutes so that the outside world would know that all neutral American expatriates were suffering. I could not refuse this request.</p>
<p>The radio station had been bombed repeatedly for several days. After I finished broadcasting, I quickly left, and my mind was at ease. Afterwards, I was even more impressed by the bravery of those who stayed in the building day and night, and the telephone operators.</p>
<p>One day, I had the opportunity to photograph more than twenty captured young German soldiers and repeatedly asked them why they inflicted such terrible suffering on the Polish civilians. They all replied in unison, "We have to do this."</p>
<p>In the following days, rumors abounded, such as large squadrons of British and French planes would come to help, there was a rebellion in Germany, and the war was about to end, and so on. The most unrealistic was that the two armies would cease fire to allow neutral country expatriates to safely leave Warsaw. This rumor actually became a reality.</p>
<p>On September 21st, the radio station announced that there would be a three-hour ceasefire from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM to allow all expatriates with neutral country passports to evacuate. We gathered at the Bristol Hotel and saw German planes flying over, dropping leaflets written in clumsy Polish that said, "Poles, you can rest now! If you do not surrender immediately, we will have to bomb you with planes and cannons." The Poles read it and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Our group of 1,200 expatriates from thirty countries set off in several trucks at 4:30 PM, crossed the Vistula River, and passed through a residential area of rubble. Countless workers' homes had been burned to the ground. We continued forward to the front lines and got out of the vehicles to walk. We could not help but shed tears when we shook hands and said goodbye to the Polish soldiers on the front lines. Before long, we could faintly see German soldiers in the distance. As we got closer, we saw young German soldiers wearing new gray uniforms, welcoming us with joy. Some hugged babies, some kindly helped carry suitcases, and others took off their coats to lend to women to keep warm. They were all smiling and polite. They had been attacking us for weeks, and now they were carrying our suitcases and caressing our babies. German officers filmed the scene to show the German army's friendliness.</p>
<p>We then arrived in Königsberg, Germany, and stayed in hotels, all under surveillance. With a thoughtful look on my face, I went to a barbershop to get a haircut and could not help but ask the barber why Germany had invaded Poland. He replied, "Don't you know that we never attacked Poland? The barbaric Poles repeatedly attacked Germany, and we were forced to defend ourselves."</p>
<p>I also went to see a movie, and the newsreel showed the destruction in Poland. The Germans were clearly proud of conquering Poland. One thing worth noting was that even though the war film lasted for half an hour, there was no applause or cheering. Even when it showed Hitler mingling with soldiers on the front lines like brothers, there was no cheering. The audience certainly saw the German army victoriously marching into Poland, but they also saw the ruins left in the wake of the German army and the frightened faces of the Polish refugees. This was actually a powerful anti-war propaganda, but the German side obviously did not notice it.</p>
<p>Today, Warsaw is full of ruins, and those who crawl on the streets are suffering from hunger and disease, with no one to help. The Germans have stipulated that if one Pole carrying weapons is arrested, ten people will be executed. And if a Germanized Pole (whom the Poles call traitors) is "silently killed," one hundred Poles will be executed, and men and women will be driven to a broad area to watch the execution. A few Poles shouted "Poland will never die!" when they were executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Typhus is rampant, and coal is scarce. German soldiers returning from Poland speak of "a graveyard-like atmosphere, the silent submission of the peasants, and the hatred in the eyes of the murdered dignitaries," and still seem fearful.</p>
<p>The German army has handed over the difficult task of ruling Poland to the secret police. Civilian criminals are flogged sixty to one hundred and twenty times every few days. Priests are not allowed to perform absolution rites for those being executed. Art treasures from Warsaw and Krakow have been transported to Germany. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Education Commissioner Xu Summarizes Education in Zhejiang Province Over the Past Year (4) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(2) Regarding Township and Village Chiefs Concurrently Serving as Principals, or Principals Concurrently Serving as Township and Village Chiefs, this was originally an economical measure due to a lack of talent. It is stipulated in the outline of county-level organizations and the implementation guidelines for national education, namely the so-called "three-in-one system." Unfortunately, the qualifications for Township and Village Chiefs and the qualifications for Principals are different, resulting in Township and Village Chiefs not meeting the qualifications for Principals, making it difficult to serve concurrently. The various difficulties raised by the counties are indeed factual, but ways to remedy the situation should be sought. The difficulties are roughly as follows: (1) Township and Village Chiefs are not knowledgeable about education; (2) Principals are not knowledgeable about self-governance; (3) It is appropriate for Township and Village Chiefs to be filled by local people; (4) Principals may be from other places; (5) Township and Village Chiefs will be elected in the future; (6) Principals are appointed; (7) Both parties have heavy workloads and cannot handle both; (8) Limited time and energy, taking care of one thing and neglecting the other. The difficulties mentioned above can be resolved using the following methods: (1) Temporarily fill the positions with those who can serve concurrently; (2) Provide short-term training to each; (3) Establish a Director of Instruction to handle school affairs; (4) Principals must concurrently serve as Deputy Township and Village Chiefs to facilitate coordination; (5) Appointment after the election is also possible.</p>
<p>(3) Compulsory education is necessary for the implementation of national education. The implementation steps proposed by the counties mostly follow the guidelines, including investigation, persuasion, posting names, and fines. In addition, little attention has been paid to how to use the Baojia system, how to divide districts, and how to stipulate the age for admission in order of priority. In the future, attention should be paid to (1) defining the scope of school districts; (2) ascertaining the number and age of children and people who should be admitted; (3) stipulating the number and age of people who should be admitted; (4) using Baojia chiefs to persuade and supervise; (5) finally implementing compulsory measures.</p>
<p>(4) As for raising funds for national elementary schools, the circumstances of each school are different, so it is not possible to generalize. On the one hand, the fund-raising methods should be followed, and on the other hand, the local conditions should be considered. However, attention must be paid to (1) actively creating property as a permanent plan; (2) actively organizing existing educational funds and public property to prevent private control; (3) avoiding excessive taxation and disturbing the people to facilitate implementation; (4) focusing on raising large amounts of funds from properties such as ancestral property, cemetery property, and association property; as for temple property, which is the most common and most numerous type of property, it is restricted by the regulations on the supervision of temples, and it is necessary to request the central government to amend the percentage of funds allocated for subsidies before it can be handled.</p>
<p>(5) The issue of teachers is one of the major issues in the implementation of national education. The cultivation of teachers cannot be completed in the short term, so the methods proposed by the counties are mostly stopgap measures, such as registration, screening, testing, examination, workshops, and short-term training. Only five or six counties are able to establish simple normal schools. In the future, attention should be paid to (1) establishing simple normal schools and reducing the number of middle schools; (2) utilizing junior high school students to teach; (3) conducting planned short-term training; (4) conducting small teacher qualification examinations every semester; (5) transferring teachers for training; (6) rewarding advanced studies; (7) strengthening the guidance organization and implementing guidance work.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the various laws and regulations on national education, there are still some that should be discussed and revised. The opinions raised by the counties will be collected, further studied, and then recommendations will be made to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>3. Regarding School Education</p>
<p>There are many problems that need to be improved in today's elementary school education. The provincial supervisors have repeatedly given instructions after their inspections, but the schools have rarely complied. Here are the major problems: school facilities, children's health, and the treatment, evaluation, rewards, and punishments of teachers. These are all critical issues.</p>
<p>(1) First, regarding school facilities, for example, (1) equipment is empty, with no newspapers, books, charts, or diagrams, making it impossible to teach even with good teachers; (2) the school grounds and farms lack equipment, making the so-called production labor training empty words; (3) the sports fields are not equipped, making it difficult to train children's physical fitness and difficult to hold public gatherings; (4) the wartime environment lacks arrangements on how to enhance children's and the public's anti-war sentiments and cultivate patriotic concepts; (5) sanitary facilities are completely absent, making it impossible to develop neat and clean habits, which has a great impact on children's health; (6) forms and registers are not available, making the statistics of the entire county, province, and country inaccurate; (7) the number of places is insufficient, and even though many schools are established, they do not make up for the reality and only waste public funds; (8) teaching in dialects limits children to one area and treats compatriots from other places as foreigners (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Chengdu's Three Institutions Unite to Promote Rural Vocational Education <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Chengdu Correspondence) The Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, and the China Vocational Education Society have recently jointly launched rural vocational education and have designated eight acres of land south of Jinjiang River outside Xin Nanmen, east of Taiping Street, and west of Xincun as the first phase of the promotion area. The focus of education will be on farmers and small-scale factories in the area. In order to increase farmers' production, they are promoting the hand-weaving industry. A small workshop will be established in the area with 20 to 30 hand-spinning machines. Personnel from the hand-weaving training institute of the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee will be sent to guide and encourage local women farmers to come and learn. The goal is to complete the training in one month, and then loan out machines to each household. The area will supply the raw materials, let them spin them into cotton yarn, which will be purchased by the area, assembled, and sold centrally, gradually expanding the scale. The hope is to create a weaving area in the shortest possible time to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency. At the same time, it has also been decided to unite with the Sichuan University College of Agriculture and the Agricultural Improvement Institute to introduce improved vegetable seeds to the area, assist in pest control, and lend improved agricultural tools in order to reduce costs and increase production. Furthermore, during farmers' and workers' spare time, they will be encouraged to go to school to receive education, learn common knowledge and practical literacy, establish a medical room, promote public health, and consult with the National Bank to provide cash loans in the area to benefit the common people. Preparations are currently underway.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Finance - Forward Foreign Exchange - Lacking Demand - Due to Long-Term Outlook <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The British-American exchange market was stagnant. Initially, the spot market had softened due to speculators hedging, but the amount was minimal. However, forward exchange lacked demand and remained firm, indicating that operators are taking a long-term view. In the afternoon, Chinese banks became unwilling to sell, and buyers were nowhere to be found, causing prices to rebound and become firm. At closing, both spot and forward prices were the same: British gold at 3 pence 765625, American exchange at 5.96875 yuan. Forward prices were calculated to be 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan looser.</p>
<p>Recent Tightening Seen</p>
<p>In the morning, private exchange rates for British to American, Shanghai, etc., were flat. American to British, Shanghai, etc., also showed no fluctuations. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 pence 78125 for Central Bank gold and 5.96875 yuan for American exchange, the same as Saturday's closing prices. After the opening, the market was calm. It was rumored that the Netherlands Trading Society had purchased spot American exchange, which Chinese banks sold at 5.96875 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also unchanged. Subsequently, the underlying trend tightened slightly, as there were few sellers, initially causing prices to soften simultaneously. Hong Kong Power sold this month's foreign exchange to foreign banks at 3 pence 1765625. Speculators then had demand and rushed to buy this month's American exchange at 5.9375 yuan from Youli Bank and foreign banks. At the noon close, spot British gold was at 3 pence 765625 and American exchange at 5.9375 yuan, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Result Close to Flat with Forwards Easier</p>
<p>The market then rebounded, partly due to reduced trading and partly because Chinese banks were unwilling to sell, lacking counterparts. Only Youli Bank absorbed a little, causing prices to rise slightly. This month's Shanghai branch of Chinese banks sold to Youli Bank at 5.96875 yuan, and the situation remained the same at the close. As a result, both spot and forward British gold closed at 3 pence 765625, and American exchange at 5.96875 yuan, with forward prices 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan looser than Saturday's close. Near-term and spot prices were uniformly flat.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Fluctuated Slightly</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot prices for British, American, and Japanese exchange showed no changes. British forward exchange opened at 1 shilling 3 pence. Shanghai exchange spot fell 50 cents to 395.5 yuan. At 10:55 AM, it was stable. American exchange spot tightened 0.0625 to 23.6875 yuan. Shanghai exchange spot rebounded 5 yuan to 396 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was stable. Shanghai exchange spot continued to rise 2.5 yuan to 398.5 yuan, with the rest unchanged. At 2:10 PM in the afternoon, it was flat. Shanghai exchange spot fell back 2 yuan to 396.5 yuan, with the rest unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Exchange Slightly Soft</p>
<p>Tianjin, (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfer was unchanged, still opening at 4 pence 25. New York telegraphic transfer softened 0.03125 to 6.6875 yuan. Shanghai exchange fell 25 cents, and "Joint Notes" on the black market also rose 25 cents, with both rates at 88.5 yuan. The market will be closed for one day tomorrow (Tuesday).</p>
<h3 id="e63">Gold Market: Widespread Buying Interest - Once Breaking Through the 5,800 Yuan Barrier <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for spot gold rose in the first half of the day and was flat and weak in the second half. The result was still a gain, and confidence remained firm. Initially, foreign exchange was reported to be soft, coupled with widespread buying interest, causing prices to rise sharply, once breaking through the 5,800 yuan barrier to reach 5,810 yuan. It was rumored that gold firms and their clients were increasing their long positions, and a certain bank was covering its short positions, resulting in strong upward pressure. Later, the exchange market turned flat, buying interest gradually dissipated, and selling to close positions before the close caused prices to retreat slightly. As a result, the closing price was 5,786 yuan, up 15 yuan from Saturday. Total trading volume was over 4,000 taels. No swaps were done. Premiums were around 10 yuan. Gold firms issued securities for 200 taels of spot gold at a price 10 yuan lower than the futures price. Silver shops did not change jewelry prices, and customs gold was flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose Very Little</p>
<p>Initially, sentiment was excited. At the opening, buyers pushed prices up slightly to 9,780 yuan. It was said that gold firms issued 20 taels to banks. Before long, banks sold 30 taels to gold firms, lowering the price by 10 yuan to 5,772 yuan. Shortly thereafter, buying interest was extremely high due to a certain client of a gold firm increasing their long position, reaching 5,800 yuan. Qian Dui Ye (money changers) had entered 20 taels into banks. Although scattered sellers appeared, the price increase was only about 10 yuan. It was said that gold firms issued securities for 20 taels, quoting 5,785 yuan. Ultimately, due to the softening exchange market, banks helped to cover short positions, and with low supply and high demand, prices broke through the 5,800 yuan barrier. Qian Dui Ye did 20 taels at 5,810 yuan. However, some people took the opportunity to sell at high prices. Soon, prices re-entered the 5,800 yuan range. It was said that banks did 20 taels at 5,785 yuan. Until the close, there was little fluctuation. The result was 5,789 yuan. In the afternoon, there was little gain or loss, with fluctuations of only 1-2 yuan. At the opening, gold firms entered 20 taels into banks at 5,790 yuan. Later, the securities firm entered 20 taels into banks at 5,792 yuan. Finally, due to Qian and gold firms selling to close positions, it was slightly weak before the close. It was said that banks did 30 taels at 5,775 yuan. The result was that banks did 30 taels at 5,786 yuan, up 15 yuan from Saturday. The high and low for the day differed by 35 yuan. Gold firms' listed price for spot gold was over 10 yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. Currently, jewelry gold is 50-60 yuan lower than listed gold, and little business is done.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price for silver jewelry remained unchanged. Datongheng was listing 590 yuan, and Xintongheng's price was similar, with the purchase price about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Fluctuations Very Slight</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: spot prices fluctuated very slightly, ultimately trending slightly higher. British and American gold pounds rose slightly by 50 cents. British gold notes were stagnant as before. The market price was flat. American gold notes once rose to 16 yuan 78 cents, ultimately retreating to 16 yuan 73 cents, a slight increase of 1 cent from Saturday. Hong Kong notes tended to soften slightly, with the market at 4 yuan 01 cent. Japanese gold notes again fell, with the evening market at 1 yuan 53 and a half cents. The upward trend of Korean notes had stopped, with the evening market still at 1 yuan 27 cents.</p>
<p>Discount and Call Rates Varied</p>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly fell again. The discount rate for entering was 75 cents per thousand yuan, and for exiting, it was 1 yuan 25 cents, 25 cents smaller than Saturday. The money industry association's call rate rose 1 cent, with both morning and afternoon markets quoting 7 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Securities - Domestic Bonds Calm <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for securities was still in a state of consolidation. Class E bonds were slightly lower in the afternoon due to the calculation of winning numbers. Other bonds fluctuated, still in a state of contention between bulls and bears. There was still an element of uncertainty, preventing the bond market from rallying after the establishment of the international loan. Yesterday morning, Yitai, Tongshun, and the newly listed Yizhong all saw buying, while Hongda, Tongkang, Chengkang, Lianyi, Shuntai, and Zhongyi all saw selling. Market prices still felt weak and unable to rise, retreating slightly by two or three jiao. In the afternoon, Tongshun, Qia Tai, and Yizhong continued to buy, and Lianyi and Yongkang also showed considerable interest, but Hongda, Tongkang, and Chengkang continued to sell. Shengda, Lianhe, and Dingkang all saw selling. Class E bonds had the calculation of winning numbers removed, and market prices mostly rebounded slightly. As a result, they uniformly retreated by about one jiao, with Class E bonds retreating by seven jiao after the removal of winning rights. The total transaction volume was 1.78 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of China National Products Public Co. stock were traded at a price of 27.</p>
<p>The public stock market was initially very firm but then gradually turned weaker, with little trading and a lack of public interest. After the auction of new shares of the Public Wool Company, 15 shares were traded, with the price falling from 7 yuan 3 jiao at the opening to 7 yuan 1 jiao. Among rubber stocks, only Yingzha Hua saw significant trading, while the rest were bleak.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Sugar Market - Dutch Red Initially Tight, Then Flat <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend improved, rebounding slightly. The association's listed prices: cargo in public warehouses called for 73.5 yuan for coarse white native stock, up 5 jiao; 73 yuan for foreign stock, up 1 jiao. Dutch red was initially tight but then flat, with spot prices at 56 yuan 3 jiao to 2 jiao 5 fen, ultimately reaching 2 jiao.

<h3 id="e67">Yarn and Cotton - Futures Double Horse - Shenxin Opens 4,000 Bales <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is rising, and the bullish sentiment is particularly strong. However, some who made profits sold, causing a slight pullback. However, the overall trend is still firm. As for actual sales, demand for 32-count single yarn from the Hong Kong contingent remains strong, so prices are rising daily. 20-count yarn is also being stimulated, but not as strong as 32-count. Shenxin Factory opened 20-count Double Horse yarn for 4,000 bales at a price of 1,260 yuan, with delivery in January and February of next year, with a deposit of 150 yuan per bale. In the afternoon, the price of Double Horse yarn went from 1,263 yuan to 1,268 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Double Horse yarn was still good, with the initial price at 1,255 yuan. However, there were those who sold to scalp, causing a slight drop to 1,252 yuan. Subsequently, the market turned tight, as many were very interested. Small banks continued to absorb, and the market suddenly tightened. Buying interest was strong, and foreign exchange was also calm, with little change. Market prices gradually advanced to 1,271 yuan. At this time, those with floating profits suddenly sold, causing the market to drop to 1,265 yuan. However, bulls were still strong, and this continued for a long time. The scalp trade was closed, and it fell to 1,254 yuan. The closing price was 1,260 yuan. Statistics for midday trading showed 6,200 bales traded. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose 10 yuan. The amounts bought by each contingent are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 470 Ningbo 5</p>
<p>Same Trade 5,700 Wenzhou 10</p>
<p>Inland 15 Statistics 6,200</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is stable, but trading has increased slightly. Because the yarn market is good, Shenxin has sold a large amount of cotton yarn, so there should be some compensation for raw materials. Therefore, sentiment is firm, and the market should be optimistic. 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, shipped from Calcutta by Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and berthed at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was quieter yesterday. Initially, it was due to selling on Wall Street and the closing of some long positions. Later, it rebounded slightly due to buying by the same trade. As a result, closing prices fell 4-5 pound sounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by a large 5-6 rupees yesterday.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has become more active again in recent days. Factories have opened up about ten bales of cotton yarn, with a strong intention to replenish raw cotton. However, the amount of spot goods circulating on the market is not large, and the same trade's sentiment has become more bullish.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Piece Goods - Cloth Market Continues to Show Strength <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the factory cloth market continued to show strength, due to bullish sentiment and strong buying interest. Factory prices were raised, and cloth market prices all trended upwards. White goods, coarse cloth, and twill increased by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao; fine cloth, gray cloth, and dyed cloth increased by 2 jiao to 5 jiao. Velvet was in short supply, and prices also increased by about 5 jiao. Transactions in this street included gray cloth, dyed cloth, poplin, and other spot goods for this month, totaling over 1,500 pieces. The Yongwen contingent traded over 200 pieces of dyed cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, coarse and fine cloth, poplin, and foreign yarn. The Min contingent traded over 100 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill. The Guangdong-Hong Kong contingent traded over 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and poplin. The North Road Yantai contingent traded hundreds of pieces of velvet and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Due to continued strong actual sales of Eastern cloth, selling prices gradually rose. White fine cloth rose again by 5-6 jiao per bolt. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 36 yuan 5 jiao and a half. Among medium-grade brands, Flying Fish was the most scarce, rising repeatedly to 35 yuan 1 jiao and a half. Four Gentlemen serge at 1 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen also continued to rise by 1.5 fen per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Horsehair Interlining Skyrockets <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The horsehair interlining market is tight, and selling prices are skyrocketing. Most of the traders, except for Yuanchangxing and others, who have a small number of shops to meet customer needs, are out of stock and hard to find. The asking price is 1 yuan 7-8 jiao per yard, and it is not easy to obtain even for those who want to purchase 100-200 yards. This is due to a shortage of goods in the market. Horsehair interlining is essential for reinforcing the chest of Western suits. It was invented and woven in Jiangshan Village, Ningbo, so it is also known as Jiangshan interlining. It is woven by hand by housewives, who can only produce 1-2 yards a day. The raw materials are horsehair and yarn, which are sourced from Pingjin and transported to Shanghai via Ningbo. In recent years, transportation has been difficult due to blockades, and prices have risen sharply. As a result, village women are not as diligent in weaving as before, and goods are scarce and prices are skyrocketing.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Grains - Rice Prices Fall Slightly - Base Price Already High <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Following the continuous surge in the rice market the week before, yesterday was the first day of trading after the holiday. Generally, people felt that it would be difficult to sell because the Mixed Grains Association was implementing a ban on afternoon rice market transactions, so they had all turned weak. Therefore, at the start of the morning market, both large traders and floating speculators sought to sell. However, distributors were observing and did not enter, and the market was temporarily crowded with goods. As they competed to sell, the price decline began. By midday, prices for various types of foreign rice had fallen by more than 1 yuan. As trading became scarcer, the price decline became more severe, falling all the way down until the close without any sign of rebound. As a result, the closing price was about 2 yuan lower than the previous week, with No. 1 Saigon at 88 yuan, falling to 86.5 yuan; No. 2 at 82 yuan to 81.2 jiao; Huojiao at 86 yuan 3 jiao to 86 yuan; No. 2 Siam at 81.5 yuan to 81 yuan; Xiaojiao at 79 yuan to 78 yuan 7 jiao; Micha at 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan; and Sui at 72 yuan to No. 3 at 60 yuan. It is said that contracts for over 100,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were negotiated before and after, and large Ri Shang Mian An ships can be traded. In addition, it was confirmed yesterday that Dingtai Huahang contracted for 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon at a price of 91.5 yuan. It is possible that more contracts will be finalized today and tomorrow. The market is gradually trending downwards with both delivery and contract activity booming. December Xiaojiao was initially priced at 91 yuan, then gradually decreased from 90 yuan 7 jiao to 90 yuan; No. 2 Saigon for December was at 94.5 yuan and 90 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than the current period on Saturday. Total futures trading for the day was 400 tons, and spot trading was 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>A small amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 834 bags, shipped from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng, which berthed at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick Japonica and other domestic rice was still scarce, the sales market was also sluggish, so prices were difficult to maintain and continued to fall by 1-2 yuan. Kunshan prices: Jianbai Japonica 98 yuan, Qingjiao rice husk 91 yuan, 90 yuan, original bag 94-5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice and other goods weakened. Regardless of the wholesale destination, the channels were limited, and large traders continued to sell, so prices also depreciated by half to two yuan. Li Yuan opened at 98 yuan and 96 yuan; Hong Kong yuan was at 87 yuan to 80 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Flour Buying Still Active - Wheat Selling Price at 30 Yuan <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was quite active yesterday as it was the beginning of the week, but it was still dominated by foreign flour. It is expected that a ship carrying Australian foreign flour will arrive this week, totaling over 200,000 bags. A significant portion of these goods have already been sold in advance, and local traders are paying attention to absorbing them, so the market is still tight. It was heard that the Zhonglou brand was priced at 20 yuan 05 fen, and reached 10 yuan 02 jiao in the evening market. Hua Niao brand was priced at 20 yuan to 20 yuan 01 jiao, all of which were retracement trades, totaling 15,000-16,000 bags. As for the local factory flour market, there have been no changes. The wholesale price in this street is still 18 yuan, with 8,000+ bags of flat-priced flour being supplied by the two factories respectively. However, there is still less gruel than monks, and all eyes are on foreign flour. It was also heard that the Fufeng Factory may have to shut down due to the temporary inability to supply foreign wheat raw materials.</p>
<p>The wheat market is quite stable. It is still difficult for inland goods to arrive smoothly, and there are rumors that foreign wheat cannot be shipped to Shanghai, which is still under discussion, so sentiment is strong. The selling price of wheat stored in concession warehouses by Chinese factories has reached 30 yuan, and there are no whole batches available for purchase. Currently, Japanese stores are also pricing at 28 yuan. Chinese factories are waiting for the arrival of foreign wheat and are negotiating for continuous wheat supply, but the issue of ship space is still being worked out.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Coal - Coal Balls Extend Term and Increase Price - Original Price Offered as Much as Possible During the Term <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have been reporting that coal balls will increase in price again, but after on-the-spot investigation by reporters, there is a reason for this, but it has not yet been implemented. Because the coal ball factory saw that the incoming price of Hongji coal powder has reached 155 yuan, the cost exceeds the output (the coal ball factory is currently selling at 152 yuan), requesting a price increase to compensate. After Mr. Yun, the representative of Yitaixing, strongly opposed, the extension was postponed to the 11th for another decision. During the term, the old price will still be offered as much as possible (limited to current vehicles, no warehouse receipts will be issued). However, one or two small factories have also mixed chimney ash, coal slag, and inferior powders into the output to reduce costs, causing the coal balls to ignite easily but not burn well. The public association will thoroughly investigate and warn against selling poor quality products under old brands.</p>
<h3 id="e74">How to Distinguish Good and Bad Coal Balls <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>--By One</p>
<p>The author's family of four has a fixed quota for coal balls. In the past, one load of old-brand coal balls (100 catties) was enough for 9 days. A few days ago, in order to save money, they bought a load of new-brand goods for 7-8 jiao. When they weighed it at home, the weight was sufficient, but the quality was light. (The family has a wooden bucket, and a full bucket is exactly 100 catties, but this new brand of goods had more left over after filling, which shows that the quality is loose.) When burning, the fire also started quickly. The reporter was delighted that he had recognized a hero, that "the student surpassed the teacher," and that the new brand was better than the old brand. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. By the evening of the fifth day, the coal balls were exhausted, almost twice as fast as usual. He was shocked and inquired among the industry. It was said that the goods from small factories (new brands) had to use coal powder (such as Helin powder, Guba powder, and Fulin powder) to reduce costs because of the low market prices. In addition, there were also one or two bad guys who bought "chimney ash" and "coal slag" at low prices - only 20-30 yuan per load - and mixed them in, so that the coal balls were light and ignited easily, like straw fire, which burns quickly and is quickly exhausted. The raw materials for large factory goods (i.e., old-brand coal balls) mostly use Hongji coal powder, so the quality is hard, ignites slowly, and burns well. The method of distinguishing is to try burning 3.5 pounds (about 32-33 pieces) of old-brand coal balls in a stove, which takes 15 minutes to ignite and can burn continuously for more than 5 hours without adding balls, and can boil 5 pots of 10 pounds of water. This is the true old-brand coal ball. Mine extinguished in two or three hours. It's like "buying cheap, eating a hidden loss." There are also one or two stores that are greedy for profit, even though they hang signs saying "old-brand coal balls for sale," but in reality, they are putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat. It depends on whether the user is wise, researches the facts, and clearly distinguishes between the two.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: What the author said is true, but why is it that the so-called old-brand coal balls purchased directly from a certain large factory are more difficult to light than in the past, and extinguish repeatedly? Firewood is very expensive now, and there are quite a few hidden losses. Is it the small sampan factories upstream and downstream of the New Bridge?</p>
<h3 id="e75">Silk and Tea <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's New York silk market: Yokohama spot goods are still maintaining a price of 1350 yuan, futures 1367 yuan, slightly up two yuan from last week. Yesterday, foreign silk shops in this port only saw some success in Hui Jing and others, priced at 2700 yuan. As for dry Jing from Japanese factories, both foreign and domestic sales were quiet.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Oil Market - Cooking Oil Actually Squeezed <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market was completely dominated by bulls. Because Dalian soybean oil had been sold off by the Adjustment Association for more than 7,000 barrels, sentiment was not affected, so futures crude oil showed a squeeze because both spot and inventory were scarce, causing it to counter the short and be unusually lively. Although it was once pulled back due to the market report from Zhou Dao, distant water cannot quench the present thirst, and the market rose sharply again. As a result, the prices were all raised by two yuan. Trades included 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 250 barrels of road goods, 300 loads of Dayou Factory soybean oil, 1200 cans of Jiangbei local workshop butter, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil, 400 pieces of new goods, 20 barrels of Qingdao crude oil, 1600 barrels for December delivery, and 900 barrels for 200 shares. Yesterday, 450 bags of soybeans came from Quan Jin.</p>

<p>After Hainan Longan Pulp maintained a price, it eventually failed because of too many goods arriving, and there was no good sign. So, some of the customers couldn't hold on anymore, and yesterday a small number of customers released goods, which was over 10 yuan less than the market. However, most of them were still unwilling to sell.</p>

<p>— Saint-Kai Chiung</p>
<p>— December 7th — Sino-American Financial Cooperation (Continued)</p>
<p>Since 1935, Sino-American financial cooperation before the war consisted of two resolutions. During the war, the stabilization fund of this resolution was the first. The two pre-war resolutions were: the Silver Agreement of May 1936, which stipulated that the United States would purchase 50 million ounces of silver from China at a price of 54 cents per ounce; and the Gold and Silver Exchange Agreement of July 9, 1937. This resolution of cooperation was most critical since the reform of the Chinese monetary system. It not only ended the past Silver Agreement, but also established the foundation for the United States to provide China with economic assistance during the war. The announced content of this agreement includes two points: (1) The Chinese government, in order to increase its gold reserves, and the U.S. government, in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, implemented the exchange of gold and silver. (2) The U.S. Treasury Department also plans to expand the previously agreed-upon methods, that is, the conditions under which the Central Bank of China can obtain U.S. exchange to stabilize its currency, while safeguarding the interests of both China and the United States. However, the specific methods of expansion were not announced at that time. It was not until December 19, 1938, when the U.S. Treasury Department officially announced that the Gold and Silver Agreement would continue to be effective after its expiration at the end of the year, that it was revealed that the Central Bank of China, under certain conditions that protect the interests of both China and the United States, could obtain credit loans from the United States by depositing gold in the United States as collateral, in order to facilitate exchange rate stability. The wartime credit loans for goods were all guaranteed by the Central Bank, which stemmed from the monetary agreement of July 1937. As for whether this 50 million stabilization fund came from this agreement, although the authorities have not explained it, it is highly likely in retrospect, because whether the credit loan is for currency or goods, there is no difference in essence in that China obtains U.S. dollar currency. Therefore, although this cooperation between China and the United States to jointly stabilize the legal tender is China's first financial union with the United States during the war, its roots still lie in the maintenance of the legal tender system by China and the United States after the currency reform. This resolution to stabilize the currency is an expansion and evolution of past maintenance measures.</p>
<p>As for the technique of this resolution to stabilize the currency, as stated by the Associated Press in its dispatch on the 2nd regarding the U.S. Treasury Secretary, it is nothing more than engaging in the buying and selling of U.S. dollars and legal tender at a fixed exchange rate. However, the specific exchange rate used as the standard is indeed worth careful consideration. Should it be based on the current price ratio between China and the United States? Or should it be based on the current commercial exchange rate in China? According to what Mr. Moore said: "The Chinese currency has previously fallen sharply, but has recently been quite stable, so in order to improve the internal situation in China, the legal tender should be stabilized." Therefore, using the current commercial exchange rate, which is higher than the black market rate, seems more likely to be adopted as the standard for stabilization. There have been rumors in the Shanghai foreign exchange market that the commercial exchange rate will be changed to 10 U.S. dollars and six pence, which is thought to be based on this view. However, if China and the United States do not have strict measures to manage the foreign exchange market, then maintaining the current higher commercial exchange rate is already unwise. If an excessively high commercial exchange rate is used as the standard for stabilization, the wise financial authorities of China and the United States would probably not do this, because the result would be tantamount to indirectly providing financial assistance to the common enemy of China and the United States, thereby prolonging its aggression. As for isolating the Shanghai exchange market and independently raising the foreign exchange level in free China, it is certainly not the original intention of this Sino-American financial cooperation. It should be known that the Shanghai exchange market and the economic situation of free China have a strong connection in essence, and it is impossible to achieve in reality! Therefore, weighing the gains and losses and calculating the advantages and disadvantages, I am afraid that a variable fixed rate will be set based on the international situation against aggression, and the value of the legal tender will be stabilized!</p>
<p>In short, since the three countries of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom formed an anti-aggression front, the future of the legal tender has long been in a favorable position. The evolution of the Shanghai exchange market since May has already proven this, without the need for me to elaborate. Since the United States assisted the United Kingdom in cracking down on the free British pound on July 18, the anti-aggression financial front has had a preliminary construction, but China has not yet participated. After the Sino-American cooperation to stabilize the legal tender on the 2nd of this month, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom not only formed an anti-aggression front in politics, but also built a solid anti-aggression fortress in finance. In the future, with the support of China's abundant resources and the United States' strong financial resources, the finances of the three countries can avoid the unstable phenomenon of rising and falling prices due to the impact of the war, thereby expanding the anti-aggression forces to combat the establishment of new orders in the Far East and Europe. Then, this new financial cooperation between China and the United States is not only the beginning of the decline of speculators in the Shanghai foreign exchange market and those who use the exchange market for other speculations!

<h3 id="e80">Price Evaluation of Five Types of Foreign Rice: New Price Limits Implemented Today; First-Grade Tribute Rice at 87 Yuan per Stone; All Rice Market Transactions Must First Pay a Fixed Deposit; Yesterday's Rice Market Stabilization Conference Unanimously Agreed to Establish Public Warehouses <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Works and the French Concession's Municipal Council, in view of the recent soaring rice prices and their profound impact on the people's food supply, convened a meeting at the Bureau of Works meeting room yesterday (9th) afternoon at 2 PM. The meeting was jointly hosted by the Bureau of Works and the French Concession's Municipal Council. Yu Qiaqing and representatives from rice industry groups were invited to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market. Representatives from the rice industry groups included Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Shide, He Xianggu, Xing Zhigang, and eighteen others. Representatives from the French Concession's Municipal Council were Qi Bai from the Food Committee, Amirinoff from the French Police, and Klose, Ajunian, and Zhu Yigui, five people. Representatives from the Bureau of Works were Deputy Director-General He Kui, and Peterson and Bi Tulai from the Food Committee, three people. The chairman was Deputy Director-General He Kui.</p>
<p>Highest Prices of Five Types of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The matters discussed included (1) public warehouse rice storage; (2) ordering foreign rice; and (3) stabilizing the rice market. After the meeting, the members of the Evaluation Committee held a meeting at the original venue and evaluated the highest prices for five types of foreign rice. (1) First-grade Saigon, 87 yuan per stone; (2) Second-grade Saigon, 81 yuan 5 jiao per stone; (3) Second-grade Siam, 80 yuan per stone; (4) High-Fire Texture, 86 yuan per stone; and (5) Small Grinding, 79 yuan per stone. The above price limits will be implemented from today (10th).</p>
<p>Public Warehouse Measures</p>
<p>The proceedings of yesterday's meeting included (1) the public warehouse rice storage case. Yu Qiaqing first explained the public warehouse plan and expressed the hope that the rice industry would prepare 60,000 bags of foreign rice, other industries 40,000 bags, the silver and money industry 50,000 bags, and enthusiastic people from society 50,000 bags, totaling 200,000 bags, as the standing reserve grain for the public warehouse. As a result of the discussion, the principles of the above plan were unanimously endorsed. As for the practical and feasible details, the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Industry Association will each appoint two representatives to work with Mr. Yu to formulate and implement them. (2) Regarding the ordering of foreign rice, it was resolved that the rice industry should order another 100,000 bags of foreign rice from abroad as soon as possible before the end of this year to increase the Shanghai inventory. Once all orders are placed, they should be reported to the two Bureaus of Works for review.</p>
<p>Rice Grain Transactions Must Pay a Fixed Deposit</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the stabilization of the rice market, according to past practice, rice grain transactions in the rice market have not required advance payment of a fixed deposit. The chairman expressed the opinion that this practice would certainly promote speculative transactions. In the future, rice grain transactions should require advance payment of a fixed deposit. As a result, it was unanimously resolved that from the 12th of this month, all those who purchase rice in the rice market must pay a fixed deposit of 5 yuan per bag on the same day and stipulate that payment and delivery must be made within five days. The rice market will implement this strictly. Furthermore, the current rice price is rising, and speculation should be curbed to stabilize the market. It was then resolved to urge the Food Evaluation Committee to resume work as soon as possible and re-determine the rice price. All rice prices assessed by the committee will be the highest prices and must not be exceeded. If any circumstances exceed the price limit, it will be severely punished according to the law once verified.</p>
<p>French Consul in Contact with Vietnamese Authorities</p>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that important rice merchants in the city consulted with Bureau of Works officials this afternoon (9th) regarding the food supply problem. At the same time, the French Consulate disclosed that French Consul General Magre had contacted the Vietnamese authorities to discuss the shipment of foreign rice to Shanghai. According to Magre, he had contacted the French authorities in Vietnam in the past week to inquire whether Saigon rice would be allowed to be shipped out of Vietnam, but had not yet received a formal reply. Furthermore, according to Bureau of Works officials, it is rumored that the Vietnamese side will not allow the export of first-grade Saigon rice ordered after December 26, but will continue to allow the transport of second-grade and lower rice. The big problem at hand is whether we can obtain ships to carry the rice.</p>
<p>70,000 Bags of Rice to Arrive Tomorrow</p>
<p>At the same time, it is heard that the French ship "Tatanam" carrying about 70,000 bags of Saigon rice will arrive here tomorrow (10th). It is widely believed that the arrival of this batch of rice will temporarily halt the rice price surge. Yesterday (8th), 20,000 bags of foreign rice were also transported here. Observers said that if the Japanese side allows the smooth transport of national rice to Shanghai, the city's rice supply will not be depleted, and there is no fear of a sharp rise in rice prices.</p>
<p>Profit Regulations, Rice Prices Fall</p>
<p>More than a thousand rice stores throughout the city are very uneasy about the failure to stabilize rice prices. After rice prices rise, the cost of procuring rice will also increase, making it difficult to turn over economically. In addition to petitioning the authorities to request that the city's huge rice reserves be sold to the public, they also informed their colleagues that they must abide by the profit of 1.5 yuan per stone according to the market price and must not raise prices. They are also prohibited from mixing in inferior goods to deceive customers. Yesterday, in the rice market, due to the large influx of foreign rice from Hong Kong and Vietnam recently, reaching more than 100,000 stones, and the authorities' determination to sanction speculators, people were generally bearish, and hoarders also dumped large quantities, causing the price of each stone of rice to fall in all grades. It is expected that under the joint sanctions of the authorities and rice industry groups, it will continue to fall.</p>
<p>Form a Subcommittee to Discuss at Length</p>
<p>In yesterday's meeting, there was a saying the night before that the price limit for each bag of Rangoon rice should be set below 96 yuan, and it was decided to investigate and concentrate the Shanghai inventory and order its sale. However, yesterday's meeting did not yield any results. When asked about it from a certain person who attended the meeting, he said that a proper method had not been obtained for the time being, so some suggestions had to be transferred to a subcommittee for discussion. When the committee will be established is still undecided, but it is determined to follow the eager hopes of all parties and establish it in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Bureau of Works Police Detained: Strong Protest to Be Lodged; Major Bowen Has Submitted a Detailed Report; Wounded "Municipal Police" Died from Serious Injuries <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>On the night before last (8th), one "municipal police" officer in the Western District died in an accident. Five police officers from the Bureau of Works Police Department arrived to investigate and were detained by Japanese military police. The Chief Inspector, Mr. Changshi, was also assaulted and humiliated. Regarding this matter, Major Bowen, Chief of the Bureau of Works Police Department, submitted a formal report to the Bureau yesterday morning (9th). It is heard that the Bureau of Works will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Jumped onto a Truck and Suddenly Fell Off</p>
<p>According to a certain Chinese eyewitness, the incident occurred shortly after 9 PM on the night before last at the corner of Kinnear Road and Edinburgh Road. A "municipal police" officer jumped onto a truck that was moving and suddenly fell off. His brain was shocked. Not long after, an ambulance from the Public Concession Fire Department arrived and took the injured "police" officer away.</p>
<p>Assaulted and Detained the Police Chief</p>
<p>After a while, Public Concession Chief Inspector Changshi and Deputy Chief Inspector Deng Qulai arrived with three Chinese constables. While they were investigating, a team of Japanese military police also arrived, disarmed the Public Concession police officers, and one military police officer slapped Chief Inspector Changshi in the face several times before all of them were escorted to the Western District Japanese Military Police Department at 94 Jessfield Road. After the senior officials of the Bureau of Works Police Department negotiated with the Japanese authorities, they were released at 11:05 PM.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Claims It Was a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>According to what was reported by the Japanese side yesterday, the Japanese military police took this severe action because they heard that a Public Concession police officer had shot and killed a "municipal police" officer. However, official sources refused to comment, saying that they were awaiting a detailed report. As for the injured "police" officer, he was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance and died from his serious injuries. After the five Public Concession police officers were detained last night, the Japanese authorities immediately blocked off Jessfield Road and did not allow passage until 11 PM, when it was reopened. At the same time, the situation around the Shanghai West blockade zone remained calm yesterday with little change. It has not been possible to obtain information from the Japanese authorities as to when the blockade will be lifted.</p>
<p>Residents of Shanghai West Detour</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side blockaded Shanghai West, it has been ten days. Although three places have been opened, the restrictions are very strict, and residents still feel inconvenienced. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency toured the area around the blockade zone yesterday and saw that this semi-blockade state continued to exist without any changes. Most of the residents in the area are unwilling to purchase tickets under the bayonets at the entrance of YuYuan Road and Great Western Road to take the so-called "Shanghai West Citizens' Public Bus" and prefer to take a detour. Therefore, the largest number of people enter and exit from Lane 608 of YuYuan Road (namely Qianjia Lane). Furthermore, the business of the British Merchant No. 7 Public Bus is also very prosperous, as it can be taken from Jing'an Temple Road to the intersection of Haig Road and Edinburgh Road and then transferred into the blockade zone. In addition, many people take rickshaws to Kinnear Road and then transfer into Edinburgh Road and YuYuan Road.</p>
<h3 id="e82">After Allied Nations Lend Large Sums to China, Foreign Exchange Fund Increases; Native Product Exports Double; Efforts Made to Obtain Foreign Exchange; Gold and Silver Exports Are Deposited in British and American Banks <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of economic assistance to China, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have, in addition to signing barter agreements with China, exchanged China's native products such as tea, tung oil, minerals, and bristles for military and industrial necessities. Despite the international transportation lines being hindered, China's barter agreements with Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have been fulfilled, earning high praise from various countries. Recently, the shipment of Chinese native products to Britain, America, and the Soviet Union via the China-Soviet highway and the Burma Road has increased sharply. In addition, various countries have lent large sums to China. The United States has newly provided US$100 million, Britain has lent £10 million, and the Soviet Union will also provide a large loan to China, which will make China's foreign exchange fund more abundant. The policy of maintaining the stability of the legal tender and foreign exchange will be sustainable and will not collapse. The source of foreign exchange is increasing daily, so why worry about it being exhausted?</p>
<p>Native Product Exports Double Last Year's</p>
<p>After the war, the total value of China's native product exports was 76,264,000 yuan the year before last, 100,272,400 yuan last year, and 162,279,000 yuan from January to October this year. The total value of these exports is equivalent to the same amount of foreign exchange funds, which can be purely obtained by the government. However, the government still needs to provide the exporters who settle foreign exchange with domestic currency as the price of the goods.</p>
<p>Overseas Remittances Comparable to Last Year</p>
<p>According to general estimates, the total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese to their motherland in 1939 exceeded 600 million yuan. As of the end of October this year, the remittances from overseas Chinese to their motherland were 550 million yuan. It is expected that the remittances from overseas Chinese this year will be above 600 million yuan. Moreover, the international exchange network of the Bank of China has been successfully deployed, and preferential measures have been established to reduce exchange rates and facilitate overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Concentrated and Deposited Overseas</p>
<p>In 1938, the exported gold and silver amounted to 7,463,165 taels of gold and 80,330,037 yuan of silver. In 1939, the exported gold and silver amounted to 1,393,200 taels of gold and 1,967,697 yuan of silver. As of the end of October this year, the exported gold amounted to 10,131,160 taels of gold and the exported silver amounted to 15,294,640 yuan of silver. These gold and silver are all controlled by the government and transported to countries such as Britain and the United States, or deposited in overseas banks, or exchanged for foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Haixian County was once captured in July of this year, but was quickly recovered after a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army. However, the urban area suffered severe damage from this calamity. Although order has been restored, various agencies such as the county government have temporarily moved to another location to work. The urban business district is extremely desolate, and the roads are filled with refugees, awaiting widespread relief.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Form Squadrons for Air Raids and Bombings</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, eight Japanese planes suddenly arrived, divided into two teams. They first circled and scouted Chuanshan, a coastal area of Zhenhai, and then dropped bombs. Subsequently, they flew to places such as Chaiqiao and Daqitou in Zhenhai County, dropping bombs one after another. In total, more than 40 bombs were dropped in the above areas, destroying more than 200 houses and causing more than a dozen casualties. Local electrical equipment was destroyed, resulting in considerable damage.</p>
<p>Covering Fire Fails to Enable Landing</p>
<p>After the Japanese planes bombed, they flew out to sea towards Longshan. Not long after, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Chuanshan suddenly removed its gun covers and fired more than 40 shells at the shore. Under the cover of the artillery fire, the Japanese warship secretly launched three motorboats, carrying dozens of soldiers, attempting to land on the embankment of Shuangquangang. However, they were discovered by sentries on the shore, and the defending troops fiercely fired volleys and machine guns, forcing the Japanese warship to retreat.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships and Planes Still Not Gone</p>
<p>When the Japanese warship fired its guns, as many as fifteen Japanese warships were anchored from Dayoushan outside Zhenhai Port to Xiangshan Port, Shipu, and Dongmen Island. They left one after another that evening. According to news from the shipping industry this morning, in addition to the three Japanese warships still anchored at Shipu and Dongmen Island, one anchored at Ligang, and two anchored at Longshan, there were no other Japanese warships on the sea. Also, three Japanese planes scouted over Chuanshan yesterday, but did not drop any bombs.</p>

<p>According to news from the travel industry, the Japanese blockade line in Zhapu Hangzhou Bay has been effectively opened since the 3rd of this month. However, the inspection of passengers traveling to and from is very strict. Since the ports of Zhejiang were blockaded, most merchants traveling to and from have taken the route through Hangzhou Bay. After the area was blockaded by the Japanese, merchants rarely appeared. Although it has now been opened, there have been frequent reports of travelers being injured there several months ago, so it cannot be regarded as a safe route.</p>

<p>According to sources from the American President Lines, the company's President Cleveland is scheduled to carry seventy-six American nationals from Shanghai tonight (the 10th) and sail to the United States. Most of these seventy-six people are American nationals who are withdrawing from the Far East in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. State Department, and the rest had already booked tickets. It is reported that the ship will be fully booked when it leaves Yokohama on its return voyage. The President Cleveland, carrying a large number of passengers, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 9th) from Manila and Hong Kong and docked across from the First Water Plant in the Huangpu River. The last passenger ferry left the Customs Wharf at 6:45 p.m.</p>
<p>Jackson Ship Postponed Arrival</p>
<p>The first completed of the new Seven Seas class liners of the American President Lines, the President Jackson, originally scheduled to arrive tomorrow (the 11th), has now been changed to 7:00 a.m. on the 12th, docking at buoys 12 and 13 in the Huangpu River. The ship was launched on June 7th this year at the Newport News shipyard and is circumnavigating the world via Shanghai. Details have been reported previously. It will only stay in Shanghai for one night and leave for Hong Kong, Manila, and various ports in Southeast Asia the day after tomorrow (the 13th), returning to New York via the Cape of Good Hope. There are currently more than ninety passengers. This ship does not carry American nationals returning home from the Far East. The company originally planned to invite people from all walks of life in the city to visit, but later received an order from the head office that due to the extraordinary circumstances, it was inconvenient to hold the event, so it was cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Pingmei Reduced Selling Price; Should Be Resolved Soon <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association resells coal at a flat price to cooked water shops. Previously, because the Kai Ao Mining Bureau was invited to increase the selling price from 55 yuan to 75 yuan per ton, the cooked water industry in this city, seeing that the price increase was too large and the responsibility was too heavy, refused to buy it and appealed to the coal industry to reduce the selling price. After Yu Qiaqing and others took on the role of mediators, the Kai Ao Mining Bureau has agreed to consider it. The selling price of Pingmei coal should be resolved in the near future. However, whether the coal industry association will continue to resell it or the cooked water industry will purchase it directly remains to be decided. But the reduction in the selling price of this Pingmei coal can be resolved soon.</p>

<p>The charity organization Relief Association holds a winter shelter every year. This year, it is still being held as usual, building a straw shed. The location is still at the empty lot of Yan's residence on Difeng Road. More than 20 workers are working there every day, and Lu Deshen and others have been sent by the association to supervise the work. The shed construction will be completed in a few days. Once the internal treatment, bathing, and stall equipment are completed, it can begin to take in and benefit the poor. The association has recently raised more than 200 dan of cotton to be used for sewing winter clothes for the poor. More than a dozen refugees have been engaged in turning out the linings of cotton-padded jackets at the Ci Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, and more than 100 pieces have already been made, and they are still being rushed out. The association's good deeds of relieving the hidden poor and distributing rice and steamed buns can also be decided upon soon. However, as harsh winter has arrived, it is often seen on the streets and roads these days that people are freezing and starving to death. The funds for various emergency relief projects require quick donations from all sectors.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Rental Regulations in the French Concession; Consuls Still Studying; Abuses Such as Subleasing Not Eliminated for the Time Being; Municipal Council Continues Discussions with the French Side <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee, in order to abolish abuses such as subleasing and the eviction of tenants without cause within the concession, had drafted rental regulations for the French Consulate to approve and implement. The French authorities have sent these regulations to the consular authorities of various countries in Shanghai to inquire whether the governments of those countries believe that these regulations violate their national laws or whether they approve of their implementation by the French police. It is heard that the consular authorities of various countries are still studying them and have not yet replied, so it is expected that the French authorities will not take action to eliminate abuses such as subleasing for the time being. A spokesman for the Municipal Council also said that the council is continuing discussions with the French side, but there has been no indication that the Public Concession will draft similar rental regulations.</p>
<p>Chinese Law Also Has Many Conflicts</p>
<p>The chairman of the Rent Committee of the French Concession of this city drafted a draft of the Real Estate Leasing Regulations and sent it to the members of the committee for study, and then presented it to the French Consul-General for preparation for promulgation and implementation. The full text of the draft has been published in the newspaper. It was recently heard that Mr. Xu Jiashi, a famous lawyer in the city and a member of the committee, believes that the case conflicts with the agreement between the Shanghai French Concession and the Chinese Court established, and with Chinese law in many ways. It infringes on the court's jurisdiction and people's rights, and its meaning tends to protect landlords, allowing landlords to avoid court procedures and directly take back houses. In addition, the houses in the concession are all re-evaluated, and it is bound to increase rents as much as possible, which will only lead to disputes and will not alleviate the housing shortage. He has cited the French Covenant, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, the Land Law, the regulations to be formulated by France, and the supplementary rules to the regulations for foreigners residing in Shanghai, and submitted a written opinion to the chairman of the committee and the French Consul-General to raise objections.</p>

<p>The cargo ship Greek Merchant of the Sino-Greek Shipping Company in this port, which is currently leased to a Hong Kong company to carry coal, sails between Hong Kong and Annam Hongji. Last week, it ran aground somewhere while sailing from Hong Kong. Later, because the tide rose and the ship floated, the bottom of the ship was slightly damaged, so it sailed to Qiongzhoukou on Hainan Island to prepare for repairs. Now, Japan refuses to issue a permit to Hong Kong on the grounds that the ship's nationality is unknown and has detained it. The ship is now operated by a Panamanian merchant, so the Panamanian Consul in Hong Kong is negotiating with the Japanese in the hope that the ship will be released. The Shanghai Sino-Greek Shipping Company has not received any news.</p>
<p>Foreign ships on the Shanghai-Zhejiang line have been blocked in the middle of the journey since the Japanese blockaded the ports. The British ship Xin Anli sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou at the end of October. Because the Japanese warship prevented it from entering the port, it anchored outside the Oujiang Estuary for a long time. It was once forced to sail to Zhoushan. It is now learned that the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday. All passengers and cargo were returned to the original ship and unloaded at the Sixteenth Wharf. This is the second ship to be released and returned to Shanghai after the Zhejiang shipping line was interrupted. There is still no news of the release of the remaining six ships, including Moufu, Dasheng, Haifu, Feikang, Anmanli, and Xinxiangsen.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Speculative Merchants Risk Transporting Goods; Procuring from the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River; Thick Profits Can Be Obtained After Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, after the Japanese naval authorities tightened restrictions on coastal shipping, coastal shipping continued to deteriorate, and the high profits of the shipping industry have become a thing of the past. However, in recent months, some Chinese who engage in speculation in this city have purchased large quantities of goods at very low prices in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, entrusting them to barges to transport them, risking the goods being seized or detained, and shipping them to Shanghai. In a single transaction, they can make profits of two or three times. People with inside knowledge of the shipping industry stated that most of the people transporting these goods to Shanghai are merchants from this city, because Chinese merchants in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are unwilling to transport goods to Shanghai themselves, fearing that the situation in Shanghai will become even worse. They mistakenly believe in the true situation here. For this reason, speculative elements in this city who are greedy for thick profits can almost operate this industry exclusively. There is little demand for local products at the ports in Changdong, so the purchase price is low, but all sales in Shanghai must risk being seized by the Japanese navy, and face difficulties such as prices tending to fall when goods arrive in Shanghai and high freight rates.</p>

<p>The labor and management of the French Water and Electricity Company signed a labor-management agreement last month. After resuming work, there were still 14 incidental conditions that had not been resolved, so the dispute had not been eliminated. On the 23rd of last month, the workers in the mechanical department even staged a go-slow, which made the situation tense again. However, after both parties negotiated sincerely and repeatedly, most of the unresolved conditions have been agreed upon, with only four remaining unresolved. Yesterday afternoon, the labor and management met again for a final meeting at the Lu Ban Road headquarters. The labor side was attended by six representatives from the mechanical department and the transportation department, while the management side was personally attended by the manager, Fa Feilai. After an hour and a half of negotiations, the remaining conditions were also compromised. The main points were: (1) The workers' annual leave was originally 17 days, but it has now been changed to 20 days; (2) In addition to one month's salary and subsidies, workers will receive an additional bonus of 15 yuan. The fully negotiated conditions have been decided to be signed at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow. Thus, the labor-management dispute that has been negotiated for more than two months has been completely resolved.</p>

<p>The houses on Daodeli, Fuxu Road, French Concession, are owned by Shen Shumei and managed by Ping Zhiming Foreign Firm. There are 21 shops and 61 households in the alley. The rents for the houses in the alley have been increased repeatedly since the Shanghai War. The rent was increased once the year before last, and the water bill was increased last year. Unexpectedly, in August of this year, a notice was received from the management office that the rent would be increased by 30% starting from October of this year. All the tenants in the alley, believing that the landlord has increased the rent again and again without limit, are really unable to bear it, so they unanimously expressed their opposition and asked more than a dozen companies such as Xin Wanyuan to be their representatives and submit petitions separately to the French Board of Directors, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Citizens' Federation, appealing for assistance.</p>

<p>The Buddhist community in this city, believing that Master Yinguang was a great monk of his generation with profound knowledge, originally planned to initiate a memorial service to show their sorrow. However, in accordance with Master Yinguang's will, with the exception of this temple in Mudu, Suzhou, which will hold a Buddhist ceremony to express its grief, all Buddhist communities in various places will not hold memorial services. They respect the will. Checking the highest prestige in the Buddhist community, there are only Master Yinguang, Master Taixu, and Master Yuanying, but their ambitions are different. After Master Yinguang passed away, only Master Taixu and Master Yuanying were left, which also shows the decline of talent in the Buddhist community.</p>

<p>At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, dense gunshots suddenly occurred on Hongqiao Road in Shanghai. Because the area is adjacent to the border area of the French Concession, the police officers of the French Police Department stationed at the intersection of Xujiahui Hongqiao Road were immediately on alert because they did not know the truth. Afterwards, it was widely rumored that the Japanese army was conducting an exercise there, but according to inquiries from the news reporters, this was not true. It turned out that several bandits robbed a resident near the former site of the Lower Institute of Nanyang Public School on Hongqiao Road and had a scuffle with a police officer. The two sides fired more than ten shots at that time, but the bandits still escaped without a trace.</p>

One bandit opened fire to resist arrest, and the Chinese and Western detectives returned fire, knocking him down, injuring and capturing him, seizing a Mauser handgun, and some bullets. The bandit was named Ru Gui, from Jiangsu province. His accomplices, Yang Guanglin and Wang Jinshan, also from Jiangsu, failed to escape. One hid behind the accounting room door, and the other under a bed, and were also arrested. All the stolen money was taken by the fugitive Dong Xiaodian, who seized the opportunity to escape.

Suddenly, one of the bandits produced two sharp knives, intending to rob her of her coat and watch. When Jin Meimei resisted slightly, the bandits tore up the bed sheets and bound her hands and feet, then stole her coat, watch, and French francs from her leather suitcase. The three bandits left, closing the door and escaping without a trace. Later, a tea server heard Jin Meimei's cries for help and discovered the situation. He went to the front desk to report it, and the incident was reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and begin an investigation.</p>

<p>At approximately 6:00 AM yesterday, a male passenger went to the E-Tai Motor Company at number 188 Hubei Road in the Public Concession to rent a car. The company dispatched a driver, Zhang Yinsheng, a local resident, to drive car number 17712 to respond to the call. After the man got into the car, he instructed the driver to drive to the Racecourse. When the car reached the intersection of Racecourse and Dagu Roads, the passenger signaled to stop. Suddenly, several men jumped onto the car from the side of the road and instructed the driver to drive to Avenue MacMahon and Rue Massenet in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, upon arrival, the man in the car produced a handgun and forced Zhang out of the car. One of the men drove the car away at high speed, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, Zhang reported the incident to the French Concession police station. However, since there were no incidents in the Public Concession and the French Concession yesterday, it is still unclear what the bandits intended to use the car for. As of 7:00 PM last night, the robbed car had not yet been found.</p>

<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>I always thought that among all the new inventions of mankind, there were already masterpieces of nature serving as their models; humans, being more intelligent than other animals, are simply good at imitating and conveniently copying them. Now, I will pick a few examples at random to substantiate my claim.</p>
<p>Paratroopers</p>
<p>In villages, roadsides, ridges, and meadows, almost everywhere, you can see a short, yellow flower with serrated leaves. Its name is dandelion, the same dandelion that scholars and men of letters speak of in "Blue skies, yellow earth" and "Yellow flowers on the outskirts like golden nails." This seemingly humble dandelion, which no one finds rare or admires, possesses an unusually large reproductive capacity because it can adopt the most effective method of colonizing territory, which is the aerial parachute method that people are now familiar with.</p>
<p>Originally, when its seeds mature, a cluster of white, fluffy down emerges from the flower receptacle. Look at how exquisite and orderly the geometric pattern of that down is! It is composed of many brown seeds arranged in order. If you approach and observe carefully, you can see that on top of each seed is tied a small umbrella made of white down. These are the whole team of paratroopers waiting to be dispatched to conquer neighboring lands! They only wait for the wind to blow, and then they rise straight into the air, drifting and swinging, invading everywhere. Wherever they land, they take root and sprout, settle down and establish a career. This territory is of course considered to be conquered by it. Strangely enough, the parachutes that these seeds carry also have the function of "seaplanes." Because if a paratrooper is blown into the water, the small umbrella will immediately curl into a ball, which can carry the paratrooper to land in a suitable place. We can now understand why there are traces of dandelions everywhere.</p>
<p>If the reader is interested, you may wish to find a dandelion down ball in the wilderness or garden: pluck it down, blow it with your mouth, and you can see hundreds of white parachutes dancing one after another. You can be regarded as seeing with your own eyes the battle of the Dutch soldiers a few days ago.</p>
<p>Time Bomb</p>
<p>In the tropical regions of South America, there is a tree called Sablier elastique. Its sap is like milk and is used as a raw material for rubber. Oil can be extracted from the seeds to treat diseases. However, the most strange thing is the way its fruit disseminates seeds: we can really call it a "time bomb." This fruit is larger than a human head, flattened and round in shape, and the outer shell is split into a dozen to twenty segments. We can imagine it being similar to a peeled pomelo. When it is fully ripe, the outer shell becomes dry and shriveled. Relying on a kind of uncontrollable latent force inside it, there is a loud boom, shaking the earth and moving the mountains. It really seems like a bomb has exploded, shooting the fruit segments and seeds to extremely far places. Isn't this a time bomb? Museums that collect it for preservation as a specimen, fearing that it will cause trouble, use iron wires to wrap it tightly. However, even so, it still cannot withstand its sometimes bad temper, blowing up the glass cabinet into powder—</p>
<p>Black Smoke Screen</p>
<p>The guy that makes the smoke screen is an animal that we are relatively familiar with: it is the cuttlefish that we sometimes use to serve with rice and wine! We know that it has an "ink sac" in its belly. When it is chased by enemies, such as when it is about to be swallowed by a large fish, it squirts ink at the eyes of the enemy. Due to the diffusion effect, the ink quickly turns into a cloud of black mist. When the enemy's eyes are blinded by this black mist, the cuttlefish takes the opportunity to escape. Isn't this a very wonderful smoke screen effect?</p>
<p>Tank Trap</p>
<p>There is an insect called Fourmi-lion, which we can translate as "antlion" because its larvae specialize in catching ants as food. The way the larvae catch ants is to dig a funnel-shaped cave in the sandy soil, and it squats at the bottom of the cave patiently waiting. If an ant is walking on the edge of the cave, the mass of this small tank itself will cause the sand on the edge of the cave to collapse, sliding it to the bottom of the cave all at once. The small antlion lying in ambush below can catch it for food. Sometimes, this small antlion sprays a rain of sand from its mouth, making sizzling and popping sounds, as if opening a machine gun and shooting the enemy down from above. This can also be called a flat-shooting gun to hit tanks.</p>
<p>Stinky Poison Gas</p>
<p>Among the animals that release poison gas, the one we are most familiar with is the weasel, whose tail hair can be used to make small regular script brushes, commonly known as the yellow weasel. When it is chased by people or larger animals, it releases an unbearable stench from a gland in its anal sac. Foreigners call this beast the "stink beast", and there is a proverb "the more you kick the stink beast, the stinkier it gets." In the Americas, there is an animal of the same kind called Monfette. The stinky juice in its anus can be shot more than ten feet away. The smell of this thing is so strong that if it is shot into a house, the house can no longer be lived in, and if it is沾to clothes, the clothes can no longer be worn! It is not yet known whether the animals shot by it will be stunk to death, but it would not be an exaggeration to call this thing poison gas.</p>

<h3 id="e120">The Interpretation of Success <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Lai</p>
<p>No one doesn't want to succeed, but there are really few people who succeed. Because most people do not have firm resolve and lack courage. When they encounter difficulties, they lose heart and become discouraged, abandoning their efforts halfway and refusing to try again. Success is not an easy thing. It often requires several failures and struggles to reach the goal. A misunderstanding of the meaning of success, leading to going down the wrong path, making the goal of success further and further away, is also a reason.</p>
<p>The easiest things for people to associate with success are money and power, thinking that having money or power can be considered success. Therefore, they hoard, manipulate, speculate, gamble, sell their conscience, and compete for power and profit, doing everything to achieve the purpose of "success." In fact, are money and power the weights to measure success? Are high-ranking officials successful people? Einstein was a Jewish refugee expelled by Hitler; Gandhi's entire property was estimated to be worth only seven and a half jiao. But one is the inventor of the theory of relativity, and the other is the leader of the Indian independence movement. But don't misunderstand the relationship between fame and success. Successful people not only do not necessarily enjoy fame, but also suffer great humiliation. Wasn't Socrates sentenced to death? Wasn't Galileo considered rebellious? Columbus discovered the New World, but was insulted as a prisoner, brought back to Spain in chains, and died in disgrace. Even the continent he discovered is not commemorated by his name, but commemorates a cartographer named Amerigo. And fake philanthropists and fake educators with great reputations can be found everywhere. So there is no need to publicize oneself, let alone buy people to praise oneself, deceive the world and steal fame, thinking that it is success.</p>
<p>We understand that grabbing money, grabbing power, and selling fame are not methods to achieve success, because having money, power, and fame does not necessarily mean success, and success does not necessarily mean having money, power, and fame. Only those who increase human happiness are successful people, and only honest and earnest effort is the method to achieve success. Not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of failures, identify the goal, and work hard, there is no way not to succeed; even if you fail, being able to fight to the end is also a success!</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>The people serving in the front cabin, upon hearing the sound of the cabin boss slapping the table, a fat woman in her fifties, with powder on her face and flowers in her hair, hurriedly stood up and peeked inside. Seeing that everyone's faces were still looking good and they were drinking with each other, she was relieved. The scholar, sitting facing outwards, saw her at a glance and said, "Aunt Xu, bring more wine." Aunt Xu quickly stepped forward, with a flattering smile, and said, "Master Zhang, Jingyuan is here. Do you want to go ashore? Drink less wine, I'm afraid Ying'er and Jiang'er will get drunk." The scholar nodded and said, "Jingyuan is here? We might as well go ashore for a walk." At this time, the boatman had already punted the boat closer to the shore. Suddenly, someone on the shore shouted loudly, "Distinguished guests on the boat, would you like to give us some wine and meat to eat and drink? My stomach is still empty today." The voice was as loud as a bell, deafening. The scholar and the beautiful women in the cabin looked out through the windows and saw a very burly man, wearing an open shirt and holding an iron bowl, standing upright on the river bank under a large willow tree. Although he was a beggar who played the flute and begged, his appearance was strange and different from ordinary beggars. He had a deep knife scar on his forehead, his eyes were bright and piercing, and his beard under his chin was like halberds, like Zhong Kui in those years, shooting out his electric gaze, staring intently at the boat window.</p>

<p>Jiangzi turned her face away in fear when she saw this burly man and said, "Oh! This man is so frightening?" The beautiful woman, however, paid close attention to him. The boatman on the bow shouted loudly, "You beggar, why are you making such a fuss? Our boat hasn't docked yet, and you're already begging from us. Get out of here quickly, don't annoy our Master Zhang." When the man heard the boatman scolding him, his face changed, his eyes widened, and he said, "I only ask to borrow some wine to drink, I don't beg for money. Whose power are you boatmen relying on to bully people who wander the world? What Master Zhang? I want to see him." Before he finished speaking, he jumped to the bow of the boat. The boat didn't even sway. Such a heavy and large body was as light as nothing. The boatman still didn't know the danger, reached out and pushed the man, trying to push him into the water. Who knew that the man's body was like Mount Tai, motionless. The boatman staggered back two steps, almost tumbling headfirst into the water. The man laughed loudly and said, "You don't know your limits, don't know how to advance or retreat, and are asking for trouble yourself." The scholar and the beautiful woman, watching, came out of the cabin together. The others on the boat, seeing a stubborn beggar coming, still wanted to scold him. The beautiful woman quickly waved her hands at everyone, telling them not to argue with the man. She gently moved her lotus steps, walked over and said, "Warrior, what are you doing on our boat?" When the man saw such a beautiful woman walking gracefully, his fierce aura immediately subsided, and he stood upright and said, "So it's Miss Liu. I haven't had any wine to drink today, and when I saw this painted boat, I knew there were wealthy people out enjoying the spring, so I begged for some leftovers to moisten my parched throat, and I didn't dare to do anything else." The beautiful woman was stunned when she heard the man call her Miss Liu and asked, "Warrior, you don't know me, how do you know my surname is Liu?" (V)</p>

<h3 id="e123">Impressions of the Young Edison Film - Essay Contest on "Young Edison" - Youth Section <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Third Place Zheng Jiuxiao</p>
<p>Before the main feature "Waterloo Bridge," there was a short film "Servant of Mankind," which presented the great figures in American history: Washington, Lincoln, and the third should have been Edison. It succinctly narrated his life's inventions. The final scene showed four or five children looking up at the great man's portrait, a kind of innocent, bewildered gaze, which filled me with indescribable emotion!</p>
<p>This short film, seen shortly after the premiere of "Young Edison," was clearly meaningful. The impression "Young Edison" gave me, in recollection, is like a lonely sail braving the wind, sailing towards the boundless horizon on a bright sea.</p>
<p>The spirit of science is the spirit of seeking knowledge. Newton once said: "Truth is like the vast ocean spread out before us; all that we do not know. I am but a child picking up shells by the seashore." I believe this is by no means an ostentatious expression of humility, but a sincere confession from someone who studies. In the film, Edison also said something similar: "There are so many, many things I don't know, and these things all amaze me. Look at those grasses, why are they green? Why aren't they purple, or black, or yellow? And when a sound disappears beyond our hearing, where does it go?" "No one really knows." This was his sister's reply, and it's the answer most people would give. It's not only that no one knows, but also that no one even thinks to find out. Edison eventually learned many, many things from the many, many things he didn't know. In 1878, he captured the vanished sound, answering a question of "I don't know."</p>
<p>But the spirit of science is not only about seeking knowledge but also about continuous seeking. There are many people in the world who want to understand all natural phenomena, why should only a few find the answers? In 1879, when he invented the light bulb, he tested the filament nine thousand times before finally succeeding. This spirit of diligent pursuit of knowledge, dedicated and unremitting, provides us, the youth, with such a profound lesson! The meaning of life is continuous learning. In the film, seeing the more than one hundred dishes marked with toxic symbols in the basement laboratory, and the chemistry books bought with the money earned from their sale, it seems to be satirizing our youth's tendency to follow the beaten path, and indolence! It also directly shatters the illusions of those who are slightly clever and dream of being geniuses.</p>
<p>Edison's greatness lies in the fact that he always thought of others first, caring little about himself. In his eighty-five years of life, he invented hundreds of things, all of which were needed by mankind. There was no utilitarian concept mixed into his thinking. What can be seen in the film, and is also a fact, is that when he rescued the stationmaster's son from under a freight car, this courage of self-sacrifice was fully revealed. Also, when his mother had a back ailment and there was not enough light for the operation, he cleverly used the reflection of a mirror to save his mother from danger. At this time, the dimness under the world's stone lamps and the suffering of mothers had already inspired in his young mind the intention to shoulder the responsibilities of mankind. Isn't the brightness of the 20th-century world a result of the warmth in his starry heart?</p>
<p>Among the thousands of films, we are too tired of odes to the love of men and women. This outstanding biopic made me feel a kind of noblest emotion in the world. The reason why Sakyamuni became Buddha and Jesus became Savior, shining on decades of history, is because they both wanted to bear the sorrow of all mankind on their own. The pursuit of truth by scientists and the sacrifice of politicians for doctrines all have the same starting point. Although the times are different and the names are different, this is the noblest sentiment in the world, and there is no ambiguity about it. In two short hours, thanks to his invention of film, I, from a different country and a different era, was left with an impression of the beginning of his great life, to inspire myself.</p>
<h3 id="e124">British Special Effects War Films <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Tong</p>
<p>It is not surprising that movie theaters in wartime Britain are booming because, in addition to the main feature, there are also tense and exciting war newsreels to watch. For example, naval battles, the triumphs of air force soldiers, the sudden descent of bombs, and the roar of arsenals are all loved by every patriotic citizen. Recently, the British Ministry of Information has specially produced a set of five-minute war short films to encourage national unity against the enemy, and provided them to theaters for additional screenings. Among these many short films, the most wonderful one is "Miss Grant Goes to the Door to Delay the Enemy." The story is quite thrilling – two old maids live in a desolate corner of England. One night, when the air raid sirens blared in the church, they found a dead paratrooper in the garden. At this moment, a British-uniformed officer suddenly knocked on the door, saying that he had lost his way to the aircraft and asked to borrow a map of the city to view. Unexpectedly, Miss Grant had already carefully studied the wartime manual issued by the Intelligence Department. She closely watched the officer's speech, and as a result, she discovered a loophole, proving that he was actually a German. So she unceremoniously picked up the pistol from the dead paratrooper and held him at gunpoint, while the other rode a bicycle out to call for help. The German cunningly asked Miss Grant for a cigarette. Miss Grant granted this request, and he took advantage of her slight negligence and unexpectedly knocked her down. But just as he was about to rush out the door, the local police also arrived at full speed. The main point of the film is: be on guard against enemy paratroopers at all times and everywhere.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, such films are extremely effective in alerting and training the public. Now the British Ministry of Information is mobilizing the country's outstanding film practitioners – including directors, actors, technicians, etc. – to continue producing such 500-foot-long short films. It is said that the cost of producing each film is only two thousand US dollars, which is almost only one-tenth of the cost of a Hollywood short film. (Translated from TIME)</p>
