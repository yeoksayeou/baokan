<p>社評</p>
<h3>轟炸重慶之測騐</h3>
<p>一週之前，本報嘗就日方所發表日本空軍於五月十八日後之三閱月內，轟炸重慶之統計，與英德兩國間之空戰，加以申論。爾後，續獲重慶電訉，謂日軍續往轟炸，所投多燒夷彈，並傳重慶市區被毀損者，幾及全市五分之四，市民喪其廬舍，無家可歸者幾及萬人；蔣委員長痛市民慘遭刧難，爰命撥款一百萬圓，亟予救濟云。頃聞中國官方發表申明，謂三閱月中，擊落日機共六十四架，估計日方轟炸重慶所消耗者，達四千七百萬美金之鉅，而重慶損失約值一百萬美金；人民死難者二零五一人，傷者三四七九人。據中立觀察家所指陳，略謂重慶損失當在不貲，但無論如何，不若日方糜費之大，絕無疑義。又外傳國民政府已遷離此殘缺之戰時首都，則由國府闢謠吾認之矣。凡此近訉，必爲同情中國抗建，關心重慶官民者所感念不置。雖然，此亦良好之測騐，不久必有事實爲明確之答案。</p>
<p>重慶在周季爲巴國，在秦漢爲巴郡，以此三千餘年歷史之古邑，竟因外侮而毀損殆盡，此應爲人羣所共歎；而死傷者五千以上，喪家者猶將倍之，此則爲人道之至慘；况以抗戰建國之理直氣壯，徒以戰備之比較落後而蒙此飛來浩刧於戰綫數百里後之後力，此尤具有正義感者所同深悲憤者也。所可夷然者：國家對外作戰之日，都市田野之被蹂躪，生命資產之爲犧牲，無論其爲五千人乃至數十百萬人，其爲一地五之四乃至全部夷爲平地，其爲值一百萬乃至千萬或萬萬，原不足異。蓋戰爭根本即是慘劇，即是破壞行爲；此在被犧牲者，被蹂躪者，爲正義，爲獨立自由，爲國家，爲萬代子孫，當然忍痛忍受不屈不悔；抑且準備忍受於決心作戰之始，詎有後悔於爭取勝利之時。更以重慶較之淪陷區域：重慶所遭者地面之損害，而淪陷區域則雖地上空氣，地下寶藏，無一而不遭損害；重慶市民死傷五千餘，淪陷人民死傷不計其數；重慶市民所失身外物，淪陷人民則幾乎并耳目心靈爲所刧持而失之。重慶誠創痛深鉅矣，遐邇聞者，罔不同情，然人心思漢，淪陷區域人民固滿望重慶爲解倒懸也！</p>
<p>刧後重慶，謂非距日方理想之標的，僅剩五分之一歟？日方轟炸重慶，謂必全毀之，今毀五分之四，而劇毀即爲近數日之成績，則全毀謂非不遠歟？日方謂毀重慶，即所以毀國民政府之政權，即所以毀抗戰建國之政策；然則不遠之將來，重慶而竟全部夷爲平地者，日本征服中國之大欲，日本亟求迅速結束所謂中國事變之企圖，謂非如願以償歟？日方如此昌言之，遂置舉世對於轟炸重慶之譴責於不顧，謂必如此邁進，始克遂行其旣定國策也。論者難之，識者非之，而日方則不但反脣相稽，且鋪張揚厲於轟炸之偉大之戰果。今者，重慶瀕於全毀矣，空言誠無聊，不久即得取證於事實。孰欲斷言方來之事實？然轟炸重慶之舉，究竟是否絕無軍事價值，而僅爲違反人道，僅爲野蠻之表現，僅爲酷虐殘忍之表現，以致雖毀重慶而無改於中日戰爭之大局？究竟是否可收破壞物質，沮喪精神之效，使國民政府自此放棄抗戰而摧毀之？此測騐也，有方來之事實，置於日人之前，公開於世界人士之前，其答案也</p>

<p>羅馬　此間消息靈通方面稱、義機猛炸埃及與蘇丹後、相信義空軍已對埃及與蘇丹發動空中閃電戰、以作陸地進攻之先聲、緣義官方公報曾謂義機已對西蒂巴拉尼•馬爾沙·馬德魯及亞力山大施行猛烈而長久之森炸、此等地方均位於埃及境內、據該公報稱、此項轟炸係於埃及政府決定派遺埃及軍隊與英軍聯合作戰以衛埃及領土後而施行者、該公報第一次宜佈義機轟炸英埃蘇丹首府喀土穆、該公報稱義空軍已開始一有系統之企圖、以炸毀喀土穆之機塲、摧殘蘇丹之英軍、並稱喀土穆之飛機庫已因炸彈及大火而受嚴重毀壞、（廿四日合衆電）</p>

<h3>德長射程大砲　再度轟擊英倫　發出巨大炸聲三響　杜佛區域為之震動</h3>
<p>倫敦　今晨九時杜佛區域、爲三響巨大爆炸聲所震動、衆信係山於法海岸德砲隊所發之子彈當時曾發警報、通知人民躱避、聞爆炸聲作時未見機影、亦未聞　聲（二十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>巴爾幹又成火藥庫</h3>
<p>巴爾幹半島又陷於以往的危局。好多年來，它是以歐洲火藥庫出名的。軍隊來往於泥濘的道路，大帝國倐而出現，倐而滅亡。二十六年前，不斷的戰爭，像火山一樣爆發於巴爾幹上，隣近諸强國，互相攘奪地位，結果造成遍世界的燎原烽火。目前烽火首先在其他地方發生，但戰爭的威脅又在巴爾幹有了反饗。</p>
<p>緊急命令的頒佈，已經自愛琴海擴張至喀爾巴阡山。軍隊經過未耕種的田土。每夜若干砲兵隊，沿着土耳其屬的色雷斯的車轍，轔轔地西開。保加利亞的農民拿他們家中杜製的布，換取軍服，乘着動搖不定的火車北上。</p>
<p>匈牙利的參謀本部則火速派遣軍隊防守近提索河及小俄羅斯山脈一帶的平原。羅馬尼亞自從强迫割讓東方邊境省以來，事實上早已在戒嚴狀態下。動員令已完全實行，每個城市，預防危險，每夜都施行燈火管制。</p>
<p>而在這四周，大國則都在互相嫉視。蘇聯軍隊，愈移愈接近德國，沿普魯斯及息勒特兩河佈防，其距形勢重要的多瑙河三角洲只有很短的行程，而距羅馬尼亞產量豐富的油田，飛機半小時卽可抵達。德國機械化部隊東開的謠言，又盛行時。在阿德利亞海，阿爾巴尼亞及伊斯脫里亞的那邊，義大利以焦急的眼光，注視着這不安的半島。</p>
<p>就歷史上講，巴爾幹半島又類似本世紀初的情形，那時德帝團及俄帝國都通過了多瑙河，互相接觸起來。那時，俄國勢力範圍伸張至塞爾維亞，遠及阿德利亞海，該處爲歐戰以前的小王國蒙特尼格羅所在地。</p>
<p>德皇威廉二世，巧妙地利用野心很大的奧王儲費迪南大公，這位王子希望產生一南斯拉夫國，在奧國保護之下，這樣一來，尾大不掉的奧帝國，無形中已受了德國的控制，立於敵對的德俄兩國的利益，遂在羅馬尼亞保加利亞等小國展開。</p>
<p>同樣情形的徵象又在現代複雜的特性下出現。蘇聯與德國不斷宣佈他們相互間的關係良好，但暗中的情形恰得其反。</p>
<p>目前這兩國蠶食東歐，與一九〇八年德國的勢力通過奧大利侵入波斯尼亞及赫斯哥維那，及塞爾維亞親俄者暗殺了一個親德的國王，設立親俄政府的時代，有好多相似之點。</p>
<p>在巴爾幹利益相反的主要國家，目前是德國與蘇聯。義大利僅就其爲德國的同盟國一點觀之，占有重要地位，因爲義大利一國，除開在地中海及阿德利亞海沿岸外，是不能起什麼作用的。英國與法國利用土耳其，曾有一時期，在巴爾幹占一地位，但這一地位已在今年六月，突告終止。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞現階段是對立大國競爭的焦點。雖則有人相信去年八月的德蘇協定中，已有把貝薩拉比亞割歸蘇聯的傳說，但蘇聯的及時而動，把貝薩拉比亞佔領，大使德國吃驚。這一假定是蘇聯深恐德國壓倒的勝利以後，或許就將不如所希望於它的那般寬洪大量，同時蘇聯認爲其鄰國相互間的戰爭不可免，必須儘速獲得所需要的有軍事價值的地點。</p>
<p>在記者執筆時，蘇聯軍隊源源開入佔領區，若干人相信，蘇聯或欲佔領摩達維亞及多瑙河三角洲，以及北杜伯魯甲，這可以作爲達到斯拉夫民族的保加利亞及南期拉夫的橋樑。</p>
<p>在他方面，德國仍想約束有野心的匈牙利，這一國家，二十一年來，就不斷談判要求外錫爾伐尼亞的歸還，而其軍隊現正躍躍欲試，將該地攫爲已有。保加利亞並無這樣鹵莽滅裂的舉動，因爲保政府深信失去的南杜伯魯甲省，無論如何應歸還給保國，因此那是不值得出於一戰的。有人相信，在此期間，德國不願與蘇聯衝突，因爲它尚有事於英帝國。</p>
<p>德國仍需要巴爾幹各國的接濟，故不需要盲動的爭奪，以擾亂巴爾幹的交通。德國感覺當它一旦能把英國消滅，處置蘇聯是很容易的。德人宣傳，他們業已準備完全，因爲他們只要從攻法的二百四十師中，抽取二十五師，就足應付攻打英倫三島的需要。雖則這樣，德國人宣稱，還是等待一個適當的時期，然後再東進，比較是個聰明辦法。</p>
<p>蘇聯直接對德的威脅，是其空軍根據地，離開羅馬尼亞的油田，只有半小時的飛程。如果蘇聯用降落傘部隊佔領這些油井，而隨後再佔領摩達維亞，它可以威脅德國所需要的攻英的燃料，如果德國向之進攻，蘇聯可以摧毀油井及煉油廠。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞政府拚命地轉向德國，要求它幫助防止東邊境的危險。但在目前，德國似不欲觸犯蘇聯而與羅國訂一條約，卽使羅國履行一切必要的條的，與調整匈保兩國關係。</p>
<p>巴爾幹又變爲充滿爆炸的藥引了。現在的危機也許可以安全過去而不致爆發，也許不然。那就要視蘇聯爲轉移。通過巴爾幹全區，敵　的勢力正在活動。保加利亞政府是非常親德的，但其人民却爲蘇聯的宣傳所激動。南斯拉夫則一方面爲其東方的血緣所牽制，一方面則爲其西方邊境的實際環境所牽制。</p>
<p>現在還不淸楚蘇聯的目的，是否是世界革命。不過無論如何，汎斯拉夫主義的傳統，是一個抵制德國東向控制東歐大陸的良好工具。在兩個國家中，都有着觀念形勢與擴張勢力的混合物存在。未來的幾天，將要看到巴爾幹的火燄，是吾高漲起來，如果不立卽發生，可是爲期也不怎樣遠。（譯紐約泰晤士報）</p>

<h3>金市傾進　金市昂騰</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市、轉呈昂騰、價已越出五千七百元大關外、在種種新謠風籠罩下、更聞越南事、法國將對日屈伏、外滙趨緊、致將各方人心激昂、且有天津幫補空訊、證券幫銀號金號傾進下、散戶更猛抬、呈步漲難回勢、由晨開五千六百八十五元、一度激升、達五千七百六十元、午刻浮多吐出、回小至午後五千七百二十五元、計尚軋升四十五元、收後復昂、下午交割例假、上半日交易共二千五六百兩、飾金升十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲四十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩），初雖報載消息利多、但買者尚少、開市僅抬五元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲五千六百八十五元、嗣因證券幫首來在拖、不久某銀號亦接踵買進、立衝出五千七百元大關、後再加某金號忽代港幫搜購、續漲二十餘元、銀號互做二十兩、升爲五千七百二十八元、此後買者稍减、金號與錢兌業吐出、曾回挫至五千七百十五元、奈未幾外滙報緊、買風復起、某銀號卽來猛扒補空、而另一金號仍不時搜入、重又飛升四十餘元、金號進銀號二十兩、昂爲五千七百六十元、午刻金號轉買爲賣、錢兌業再來拋空、市勢稍回、迨收盤降爲五千七百二十五元、結果比上日軋漲四十五元、收後塲外市勢復堅、五千七百四十元有人買進、半天七十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>銀錢業中　積習難改　少數不良分子　常使顧客難堪</h3>
<p>近來本市游資充塞、法幣籌碼隨之而增、前數月外匯套息可達三四分、上月祗有一分左右、本月因無甚差額、本月份與下月份美金差額僅〇三一二五、英金差額爲〇一五六二五、套息交易、無形停止、現鈔用途驟狹、乃有一小部份銀錢業對於往來戶所開支票、寫明「現鈔」者、向付款行提出交換、或轉托準備會代收劃頭時、竟有「祇解現鈔」之退票理由單、而實行退票者、查現鈔與劃頭原爲一物、若以「祇解現鈔」爲退票理由、非僅有礙票據流通、且在本市現在狀態中、途中收解現鈔、風險甚大、希望銀錢兩業中如有此等情事者不再留難、最好由公會通告同業、重申現鈔與劃頭原爲一體、不得因一時的現鈔缺少用途、而願用戶收現、然至現鈔需要旺盛時、又惟恐有人提取現鈔、銀錢業中不少祇顧自己利益、為難客戶、尤其是出納部分之職員、難得有幾家銀行行員態度安詳、大多數對於客戶使性使氣、待睬不睬、銀行對於客戶如此虧待、將來終有食報之日、望望然而去之、關門大吉、悔之晚矣、（英）</p>
<h3>中國二角新票　色澤素凈安閑</h3>

<h3>英鎊票　可掉換支單　市場價已穩定</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤步漲、英美金鎊因亦各升一元、英金票跌風已戢、市價突然轉漲、蓋市傳持票人得向某英商銀行掉換支單、惟須酌收手續費、以致人心比較安定、持票人已不再急於求脫、市價乃抬至五十三元五角、比上日軋升一元九角、美金票步趨漲勢、晚市高至十七元九角二分、比上日計漲一角九分、香港票不乏需要、價漲二分、日金票及朝鮮票漲風已戢、市價站平、前者仍爲一元四角五分半、後者仍站一元零八分半原盤、</p>
<h3>證券　內債又見轉機</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况依然疲莫能興、惟午後形勢已有轉變、因某銀行乘低又來吸收、多頭出籠者漸漸無力、同興號於收盤忽有大數進胃、收盤後聞本埠美軍接防已無問題、晤盤行市又略堅、昨日交易、久豐聯和聯益上下午始終買進、鴻康順亨恒孚均有買進、惟三十八號轉賣出、信孚多頭仍有出籠、協大及散戶均有浮多晚手賣氣轉盛、午前卽小二三角、午後卅八號出內入戊以戊種爲賤、中一信託買進甚湧、怡泰鴻大均有進買、同興於將收盤時突有大量進胃、賣戶以同康爲多、恒孚稍有賣出、二十號亦有出脫、一日結果續小五分至二角半、其中戊種祇小五分、以其市價爲低也、成交數目的計一百十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米交易清淡</h3>
<p>洋米昨市處於盤旋狀態下、忽升忽降、常有三五角出入、而其結果則仍與前市相似、蓋洋米存底旣充、路貨續到、而消化平淡、市價勢難抬高、然以新定不劃、貨主不願賤脫、而浮囤與內地等亦有趁小略辦、市亦不易撳小、但實銷不暢、交易終見淸淡、浮戶始知市難振作、卽亦傾脫、市色遂入疲途、收盤行情見貶三五角不等、計一號陳西貢爲五十八元三角、五十八元、新尖五十六七元、二號五十三元五角、現米成交亦不足四千五百包、原包英華司交易未成、</p>
<p>粳糯國米續到千三四百包、明暗市交易、傳聞一因貨多、二被洋米牽制、同聲告疲、價落半元左右、常幫鮮淸粳六十七元、無錫淸粳六十五六元、常州蘇崑粳六十四五元、次至六十元左右、宿薄稻六十二元、南港原包早稻六十二三元、斛見特別新鮮六十二元、普通六十元、次至五十八元、糯米金溧特元六十一元半、六十一元、常州白元六十元、丹陽五十八九元、香港特元六十一元、中關五十八元、砶元五十四元云云、周浦新粳來源亦較前夥、共有四十餘擔、而銷塲反覺不暢、是以價開見疲、冲特貨售六十二元、中關六十一元耳、</p>
<h3>粉麥湧到　月餅訉銷路不旺</h3>
<p>麪昨日殊見平淡、客銷仍以運輸不便、新交易難期開展、本街零批雖屆月餅汎中、需要亦非往昔可比、故福新阜豐兩廠產量雖少、已足應付本街也、廠盤仍爲十五元、兩廠批出數量日有三四千包、市面平淡、至日廠粉鳳凰脾交易亦屬不多、計開九月份十四元七角半、十月份十四元九角、因回籠貨籌碼已枯、期貨猶緊二角左右、現貨則與環境不良、擯　乏交、</p>
<p>又訊、昨聞洋粉新到一船、額計十餘萬包、均是砲台及旭日當天等牌、該貨尚在起卸中、又聞福新定麥一船亦有進口、洋粉麥同時湧到、市面恐一時難於過好、</p>
<p>小麥續告平靜、因值週未之期、到銷一致沉寂、日廠如三鑫協興等進胃動而不暢、吃盤亦頗重視、貨方則扳持不願輕脫、故成交數僅一二千包、聞洋麥績批運到、價已暗鬆三五角不等、</p>
<h3>油市　生油現貨　於疲跌中得買戶</h3>
<p>花生油市况、昨晨初承上日之萎疲、期貨仍甩跌一元、結果成交膠州油三千餘件、計九月下半月交價爲五十九元、十月上半月交價爲六十元、靑島油訂九月份交一百桶、價爲八十八元、現油在慘跌之下、引起內地辦胃、致行囤乘機拉抬、買氣轉盛、市價立卽陡升、統共做開一千五百餘件、價自六十元至六十二元、豆油因之轉定、交易大連油五十桶、價爲九十七元、大有餘廠油一百擔、價爲七十四元老棧單云、</p>
<p>今日出口之油豆雜糧亦不在少、生油一千一百零五聽運厦門、又六百十聽運香港、尚有豆油三百件豆子三十四包、亦運香港、運往新加坡豆子五百包、豆餅五百片、運往厦門豆餅三千五百片、麥一百二十包、運往暹邏有豆餅四十片、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市迂廻前進</h3>
<p>紗市續挺、漲風再現、但實際交易仍少進展之象，然投機人心殊屬良好、此因盤旋、爲時已久、一般吸收之額、堅不放棄、所以檯面上籌碼反帶緊象、市盤乃迂廻而前進、不過據存貨報告、各倉庫之存紗逐日增進、多方稍能獲利、卽告脫手、市盤變遷、亦迅速也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣殊緊、大家多要買進、搶多頭帽子、因之檯面甚感枯弱、二十支雙馬價爲九百三十八元、較上日漲五元、少頃微跌至九百三十四元、此時買氣驟熾、又復漲至九百四十二三元、徘徊甚久、多方稍有吐出、又回跌至九百三十七八元、迨至十一時左右、多頭復來活動、浮空跟踪抵補、徐徐上升至九百四十七元、但收盤後回好至九百四十一元、查半日間成交統計二千六百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十五元、今日有紗二百五十五件運暹邏、四百四十五件運香港、八十一件運厦門、茲將各幫口一買去之額量、分別如左、</p>

<h3>棉市仍無特色</h3>
<p>現棉情形、昔日稍有興奮氣象、然本報早已探得各方無大量的發展希望、因紗價不起、且各方存貨充足、棉市不克大漲、前途仍無大好面也、同行略有成交、白洛克價爲一百九十七元、火機花一百五十八元、惠司登二百〇八元、市價依然呆滯，無特色且有下鬆之象、</p>
<h3>疋頭　國布前途　仍看稪航能否實現　東疋棉紗已見活動</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨布市以浙閩復航、微露曙光、棉紗東疋報漲、市勢稍轉活潑、本街北帮南洋帮進意略濃、市盤堅定、叫價增每疋二角半、實際成交價格、尚多爲上日原盤、本街成交各布五百餘件、北路烟津帮辦色布粗布斜紋錢呢等二百餘件、南洋帮辦色布漂布印花布斜紋八千餘疋、浙閩帮以航綫能吾暢通、仍屬疑問、故多數未願冒險、觀望緩辦、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>本街同業及囤戶心思看高、買意濃厚、十二磅龍頭細布晨開三十一元三角、升至三十一元六角收盤、午後市氣續緊、逐步高翔、收盤時爲三十一元八角半、四君子嗶嘰升至每碼九角二分七厘半、中檔雜牌細布及細斜亦各提升每疋二角半至五角、</p>

<p>國產友生廠所出之防雨布、新近銷路頗暢、尤以大新街一帶西服店及雨衣作進胃特盛、蓋西貨雨衣布昂貴、東貨到埠奇缺、國貨祇中國愛皮西內衣公司及上海雨衣兩布廠微有出品、因其不售料、祇售現成雨衣、致未能普及、隨造成該友生廠防雨布暢銷之好機會、昨聞福建路聚源坊仁泰號開進有一萬餘碼、成交價爲三元九角、深淺米色靑灰藏靑齊皆一律、中裝大半多銷藏靑、做西裝雨衣、大半齊以米色爲合宜云、</p>
<h3>糖市　下檔車白回好</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平穩、上落無多、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十三元八角、升三角、四月七日到貨七十三元、外棧新貨七十三元半、轉口貨五十八元二角、八月十五日到貨五十八元半、太古車白B嘜仍七十四元、DY嘜六十九元四五角、升半元、HX嘜六十九元三四角、升七元八九角、荷赤　嘜六十一角、九月六日到貨六十一元半、後轉緊叫六十三元、未成、據荷蘭電爲一〇·五〇、其餘本綿白及一號冰等均乏上落、國糖亦未開出、</p>
<h3>南北貨　槐米獻新</h3>
<p>槐米近以去化呆滯、市象沉寂已久、昨聞號方已有新貨十餘件運到、貨身及色澤均佳、以值市呆恐難善沽云、</p>
<h3>五金　盤元銷路奇呆</h3>
<p>新盤元市面、最近因外滙變化倏忽、所以行市亦忽上忽落、查前昨若本釘售價回挫、而外滙未見如何鬆懈、故其標準依然堅定、查昨本釘倍司桶沽四十五元、而盤兀開價却需四十七八元一擔、故多數之製釘廠家覩此情狀、皆停工的停工、减工的减工、反覩出品貨（本釘）銷路之奇呆、故業此者人心益疲、市氣亦朽、欲挽救其頹勢、非將本街廠家所出產之元釘銷往海外不可、然最近海口封鎖、內銷與南銷均見告絕、故一時之趨勢、實難回好、新盤元之銷路、當亦受其大挫耳、</p>
<h3>煤炭　開平塊挺俏</h3>
<p>開平塊煤、到貨久乏、來源不湧、銷路更旺、街　鑒於到貨難接、不得不隨市進取、市遂續見挺佾、計做開平一號統每噸一百七十元、篩塊一百九十元、一二號統一百五十五元、塊煤一百七十五元、以上同業拆價、送到客戶酌加盤子、</p>
<h3>藥材　山甲皮升十元</h3>
<p>山甲皮近乏續到、而需要方面尚屬活動、故市價續見上挺、現市爲二百十元、比本月上旬好起十元之譜、後市或須續緊、將以銷胃如何爲轉栘也、</p>

<h3>英軍所遺防區問題　尚未臻解決階段　官塲對此繼續保持緘默　日軍接防西區猶無確期</h3>
<p>昨日本埠商界方面、對於「丁」「乙」兩防區美軍撤退後、究將由何方永久接防一事、重又表深切之關心、自上次提出折衷辦法後、迄今已一星期、而日方尚未進駐滬西區、據一般稱、此事足以證明日方對於萬國商團接替英軍之辦法、尚未認爲滿意、據悉日方不肯接收滬西、乃因彼等不願滬人信爲日方至少已一部份同意防軍委員會所作之決議、蓋彼等始終主張全部英軍防區均歸日軍接收也、昨晨官塲方面、對於此一問題、仍繼續保守緘默、甚至對於華盛頓與東京雙方是否猶在進行談判「英軍之接防者」問題一事、亦諱莫如深、</p>
<p>英經騎隊昨夜出防</p>
<p>萬國商團之鐵甲車隊、自經租界當局於前夜發給步槍後、卽開赴虹口西區、接替A字大隊中一部份休假團員之防務、又商團司令亨倍、昨日午後並召集騎兵隊所屬之輕騎隊、於昨夜七時出防、該項輕騎隊亦爲英囤隊伍、其新任務、係與前所召集之鐵甲車隊同屬用以補救A字大隊兵力之不足藉以增强該區防務、至該項輕騎隊之人數、定額爲一百十人、現在實額爲七十人左右、</p>
<p>日發言人所作談話</p>
<p>上海泰唔士報云、日海軍發言人、昨（二十三日）晚在招待新聞記者席上、對於上海外軍防區重定新辦法一事、不能發表確定言論、據稱、就渠所知、日海軍陸戰隊尚未規定派兵接防滬西「丁」防區之確切日期、某記者問、日軍旣派定接防「丁」防區、則西區新警察隊之成立、將否有所更變、發言人答稱、此乃兩種各別之問題、新警隊問題、仍未達最後階段、發言人又稱、渠意非待「乙」防區懸案商獲決定、則日軍未必開入「丁」防區駐守、惟渠預料防區問題早日可獲解決、</p>
<p>加緊查視汽車執照</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、愚園路地豐路口、日來有「市警」若干、縝密查視駛過之汽車與各種車輛之執照、聞該區「市警」加繁查視車輛執照者、已歷兩日、故汽車被查視殆遍、衆信此舉乃「上海市府」或將於下月份開始强迫一切車輛領其執照之先聲、</p>
<p>傳日方又擬新計畫</p>
<p>同時、外傳本市日當局對於滬西界外馬路區管轄事、刻正草擬新計劃一說、工部局與「市府」雙方咸守械默、惟據官塲人士暗示、工部局米必准許二月間所訂之西區協定作何更變、</p>
<h3>德方在法境　招募華工　並提高待遇</h3>
<p>自歐戰發生後、旅法華僑返國者先後已達一千數百人、因法國於戰後對於各國僑民、無論工商業及留學生之一切工作及行動、限制殊爲嚴密、迨德軍進佔巴黎以後、更予直接統制、禁止攤販在街頭設攤營業、益使僑民無法維持生活、故失業人數隨之激增、達數萬人之多、德方爲欲便利對英作戰、軍需物品產量取給便捷起見、故在法國各地大事招募華僑、其待遇亦自每小時五法郎漲至二十法郎、</p>
<h3>英倫鈔票禁令　影響貿易甚微　通常貿易往來均為滙票　引舉係謀取消英鈔市場　不使德國以英鈔匯往中立國</h3>
<p>大陸報云、英政府已頒行禁止英倫銀行鈔票輸入英國之計劃、一般商人多以英政府出此一舉後、上海市塲上之自由英金、將否絕跡爲問、要知此項新條例、僅施諸銀行鈔票、而鈔票付款之法、在國際貿易中、從未佔何重要地位、蓋國際貿易之主要交換媒介物、</p>
<p>厥為匯票</p>
<p>也、惟在特殊情勢下、一經交易、牽涉昂貴之保險費者、尤其是在目前戰爭狀况之下始有確實以鈔票滙往倫敦、以結淸餘帳之事、據英商某銀行代表告記者稱、就渠所能憶及者、該銀行於已往五年間絕未用鈔票轉滙、故英政府之新計劃</p>
<p>影響所及</p>
<p>僅爲上每將自八月二十八日起不復有英國鈔票之市塲、惟他種付款方法、如滙票•支票·及信用保證函、續有買賣、由於自由英金市塲縮小、則滙票等不致有大範圍之買賣、然此事與英政府所取上述步驟、毫無關係、據現狀察之、英政府此舉、抱有決心、志在</p>
<p>不使德方</p>
<p>獲有將淪陷區內英鎊鈔票滙往中立國、而由中立國內英國銀行代理處予以接受之機會、紐約與上海兩地對於自由英金、仍有需求、蓋使用自由金鎊之途徑、未曾完全閉斷也、日本現仍能與印度等若干英金集團國家、結算餘帳、故日方銀行在本市滙市購進英金、然英當局之意、則擬儘速取消自由英金市塲、而以官定滙率爲一切交易基礎</p>
<h3>新加坡西報記者談　日本暫不南侵　將視歐戰結果再定行止　佔華土終必不能保持</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、馬來海峽時報經濟版編輯白朗、今在從美國返新加坡途决、道出上海、據談稱、美國頗以德國第五縱隊之活動爲慮、而製造商對於第五縱隊之暗中作祟、允感不安、當渠在美國時、僅一所</p>
<p>飛機廠中</p>
<p>已發生暗施破壞事三起、時至今日、在美之第五縱隊份子、不復作結歡輿論之嘗試、而其主要目的、乃在阻撓工業生產、尤其是妨礙飛機之出產、進行最力、溯自德审侵荷後、美國輿論、似更擁護協的國、故美國民衆今什九贊成除參戰外、積極援助協的國、渠信美國不致參戰、白氏又稱、渠此行</p>
<p>途經日本</p>
<p>時、所得待遇、極不友好、爲渠前在其他各處所未遇、新近旅日英僑被捕　可奇、因若干被捕英人、頗以親日著聞也、白氏感覺日本在經濟上、已至捉襟見肘之境、而金錢匱乏、自不能無限期勉强支持、渠信日本之南進、目下不致發動、而將視歐戰結果爲定、再、日本</p>
<p>能否保持</p>

<h3>美國文藝的滋長</h3>
<p>這個年頭，那裏還有樂土？不是兵禍連結，便是災殃頻仍。得天獨厚的美國人，靠着天時，地理，人和三大要素，却還過着風調雨順，國泰民安的日子，在極度平民化精神之下，各種文藝孕育滋長，漫無止境，創造了一個美利堅文化的新園地</p>
<p>什麼纔配叫做文藝？民族的歷史，社會的習尚，和現實的環境，這種種原因都不能不顧到。美國人却老老實實，把絕端現實的生活，和極度平民化的精神，來定他們的文藝標準。他們的文藝是活的，動的，普遍的，大衆的，而在目前情勢之下，却是進步得很快的。現在且不討論美國文藝的標準，祇把最近開展的情勢，綴述如次：</p>
<p>無綫電廣播的音樂，風靡一時。著名的音樂家托斯卡尼尼每星期所指揮的交響樂，聽衆多至四百五十萬人。華爾脫丹洛希在NBC綫電台廣播音樂，每星期的欣賞者亦多至數白萬。不是山於無綫電廣播的普及，從前那裏會有如此的廣泛大衆，欣賞這種高尚的音樂？這種音樂的普及化還是近十五年來的事。至於學校方面組有音樂隊的已有三萬五千起之多。</p>
<p>讀書及讀報紙雜誌的風氣，現在也遠勝於前。文人的作品，思想取材文筆均已進步。五十年前，美國仟何雜誌的銷數從沒有超過一百萬份，現在銷數逾百萬份者有二十六種之多。著名雜誌的文學氣味頗爲濃厚，却能擁有如此廣大的讀者，這不能不說美國讀者的進步了。</p>
<p>再看美術。著的雜誌像Life等開始用彩色精印古今名畫。次如名畫集A　Treasury　of　Art　Masterpiecs定價美金十元，銷數仍冠絕他書。家庭裝飾用的翻印名盡也供不應求。向博物院美術館研求美藝的，戶限爲穿。紐的博物院近代藝術館中所舉行的畢卡索畫展，五十天中參覜者近十萬人，義大利畫展參觀者，七十三天有二十七萬七千餘人，都是驚人的紀錄。</p>
<p>社會上求學的人較之一九（〇〇年要增加十倍。數白萬的美國人都希望他們的兒女受到高等敎育。贊助敎育和科學研究的熱心人士，捐款數百萬元，提高敎學的標準。現在勤奮求學和具有科學天才的靑年，都能獲得相當的輔助，而展其所長了。政府和公家對於藝術家的幫助，也蛟以前爲熱切。</p>
<p>所謂第八藝術的電影事業，經長時間力避實質的描寫外，現在亦有長進的跡象，而且成部根據考證和事實的影片，極爲人所注意，狄斯耐的卡通畫片，尤屬無無古人。</p>
<p>大衆對於攝影的熱忱，亦爲愛好美藝的表徵。整千累萬的男女老少，拿着鏡箱攝影，到處可見。攝成底片後，在自己家裏暗房中冲洗，十足表現業餘的精神</p>
<p>如果駕駛汽車外出，一到郊外，就可以看見工程師，建築師，在那裏合作計劃所造成的美的建築物，一十世紀新作風的屋宇，雄峙在道路兩旁。新式的橋樑，水閘，一方切合實用，一、面又爲美的結精。試看華盛頓大橋，和德士古煤氣庫，是怎樣的雄偉動人，這是美國特有天才的傑作。</p>
<p>紐約世界博覽會中，美如彩虹的有色電光，亦爲光學和電氣事業上的一大奇觀。這是光的藝術之初步，日後當更有精進之作。</p>
<p>顏色的應用現在大爲進步，家庭中的廚房，甚至工廠中的機器，和百貨公司中買來的玻璃器皿，好像都是爲悅目而製造的，而佈置的呢。由店舖中購來的東西，其外觀包紮亦大改前觀，一以美觀便捷爲主旨。漸漸的大家都知道日用品都能美化，而許多人都愛用美觀的東西呢。</p>

<h3>菲律賓第一任總統奎松</h3>
<p>— 瘦杉</p>
<p>菲律賓第一任總統奎松，富於橡皮似的彈性，閃電般的機警，可算是全世界獨裁者中的一個「老江湖。」他身材矮小，修飾入時，帽子傾斜到最時髦的角度，愛好享樂，不下於權勢。他是一個極精明的撲克賭手，同時也是跳舞專家。</p>
<p>但他決非僅是一個玩玩的人，而是世界上數一數二的精明的政治家。他愛國和自愛一樣的熱心。二十世紀的菲律賓歷史和奎松的傳記是分不開的</p>
<p>他生長在呂宋島一個小鎭，現年六十二歲。他的父親是一位校長先生。他的半西班牙血統的母親則是一位敎師。年輕時，他慧而懶。旋入大學研究法律，直到一八九八年，菲律賓發生革命，反抗西班牙統治，他就此輟學。</p>
<p>一千四百萬的菲律賓人大都愛好舒適，但是他們爲了要反抗西班牙人的壓迫，一致在愛國的領袖愛基那爾杜領導之下，掀起偉大的革命鬥爭。這時美國也對西班牙宣戰，革命軍因得節節勝利。美國戰勝西班牙之後，便接管了菲律賓羣島，愛基那爾杜從此反抗美國，直到一九〇一年始爲美軍俘獲。</p>
<p>奎松便繼之抵抗美國軍隊，反抗失敗，其憤怒可想而知。因此拒絕學習英語許多年。後來，他在菲律賓某省担任律師，每月收入在五百美元左右，但不久他又放棄了，改就每月七十五元的檢察官。他竟敢以欺詐罪控告一個美國著名律師，因而聞名於全國。一九〇四年以前，菲律賓從來沒有聽見過菲律賓人按告美國人的。一九〇八年，他正三十歲，已成爲菲律賓議會及菲律賓羣島的領袖。</p>
<p>以後二十五年中，他不斷的從事於獨立運動。他祖任菲律賓駐華盛頓代表八年，回國後便當選菲律賓參議院議長。迨至一九三四年，美國會通過泰定斯－麥克杜斐法案，菲律賓遂成爲自治共和國，並規定至一九四六年完全獨立，奎松遂被選爲第一任總統。</p>
<p>他雖已六十多歲了，每日却仍工作不息。他通常天明卽起，喜歡在早餐時接待賓客。他見客非常不拘形式，時常穿着一件運動衫，而且還暢開了領口。</p>
<p>每星期中，他對於警察局，監獄，烟草工廠或政府中任何一部，總有兩三次出其不意的視察。他喜歡聽人訴苦，有時他且和工人一同進餐。若有政治犯被捕，他常親自與之談話。</p>
<p>他對於一般事情都喜歡，快幹。他曾在五分鐘內決定邀請美國前參謀長麥克亞梭到馬尼刺担任軍事顧問。他問麥克亞梭，「我只請你回答一個問題：菲律賓是否可以保衛？」麥克亞梭答曰，「可以，」他便以全權授與麥克亞梭。</p>
<p>他並不富有，外間傳說絕不可靠。他的年俸不過一萬五千元，他自己又極喜浪費。</p>
<p>他所極愛的夫人是他嫡親表妹，美麗多才，信奉天主敎</p>
<p>奎松精通英語，西班牙語和泰加羅葛土語，且能以三種言語演說。以前他曾致力於菲律賓獨立運動，但現在却不能確定是否需要獨立了。</p>
<p>麥克亞梭將軍及菲律賓參謀部都信菲律賓決能自衛。他們都信空軍攻擊菲島不會發生效力，步兵的侵略更不可能。菲律賓軍隊每年訓練新兵四萬人，定可成爲一種勁旅。但菲島缺乏近代戰爭所必需的工業設備，更沒有艦隊足以抵抗日本的海軍。</p>
<p>就政治方面說，菲律賓至少在理論上是一個前進的民治國，但是經濟方面却仍保持着封建時代的狀况。這是西班牙統治的餘毒。工業大都仍爲少數西班牙貴族所操縱，土地也大多數被大地主或敎會所掌握。眞正的農民則無法溫飽。</p>
<p>奎松已經謹愼的開始實行分裂大地主的勢力。但是他的處境和羅斯福總統大致相同，羅斯福總統若要攻擊華爾街，但他百分之七十的擁護者却是華爾街中人。奎松知道，假使要想眞正的改革，必須先毀滅封建制度－這就是天中敎會。但是這樣做去無疑的要毀滅自已。</p>
<p>奎松的反對派，力量非常薄弱。議會裏沒有一個反對他的議員。所有反對他的人，却也尊他爲菲律賓的國父。他們所埋怨的無非是說他獨裁罷了</p>
<p>奎松總統及其家屬</p>
<h3>英國防空利器</h3>
<p>近兩月來，英德空戰愈演愈烈。德國飛機以量勝人，英國飛機則以質勝人。構成英國防空主力的是優越的戰鬥機，和高速度的驅逐機。其次是高射砲和高射機關槍隊。此外還有下例兩種：</p>
<p>一是「阿士布斯一式的飛行堡壘。阿士布斯是匈牙利，有名的直起直落飛機設計專家。他從前曾在奧國任職航空研究所，繼又在德國服務，協助戈林將軍擴充空軍。歐洲戰事發生前不久，改助英國。他所設計的直起直落飛機，每架具有二千匹馬力，外面裝配重甲，並配有快射機關槍，可以制敵方矗炸機的死命。這種新型的飛機，就是所謂「飛行堡壘」。牠能够直升直降，無需廣大的飛行塲。而且機件偶然損壞，也可以安全降陸。升空之後，迎擊敵機，異常敏捷；同時因爲飛行穩定的原故，使機關槍手更容易瞄準。因爲具有這些優點，所以用來保衛人口稠密的區域，最爲適合。根據他設計所製成的「飛行堡壘」小型的可作戰鬥機用，巨型的可作運輸機用，每機可載五十人。另一方面，因爲牠可以在上空徘徊瞄準，又可以成爲最良好的轟炸機。現在這種飛機，已經有少數造成，將用來保護倫敦上空了。</p>
<p>二是空中雷塲，這種防禦敵機空襲的設備，是新近才發明的。牠的設置，是把幾百個氣球，每個有五尺直徑，昇入空中約達三萬尺高，每球用四十尺長的綫繫着一個小炸彈。敵機如果碰到了一個炸彈，一定受到很大的損壞，或竟墮地粉碎。據說祇要兩個人，在三十分鐘內就可以放出一個，而且能調整到使它們浮在任何預定的高度。空雷的製造費很低廉，因此可以大量使用，來防衛城市和軍事目標。同樣利用氣球的，另有一種名爲「防空氣球」。這種防空氣球的主要作用在它所曳引着的大鐵索。氣球上昇之後，把鐵索拉得緊緊，飛機如果碰上鐵索，可以馬上破碎。上空有了這種設備，就迫使來襲的飛機，不可能作俯衝的轟炸或低飛的掃射。至於各個氣球的位置，是很科學地分佈的；放置的地位也需要常常變更，以淆亂敵機的耳目。它的昇放，有一個嚴密而機智的指揮，好像指揮軍隊作戰一樣。上升的高度，也由指揮人體察情形來決定。像這樣的空中八陣圖構成後，敵機想進出這個鐵索圈就不大容易，據陸相艾登的報告，這種防空氣球曾捕獲德機多架，可見它的効用了。</p>
<p>最後，是一種新發明的「預測器。」它能預示敵機於某時飛到某點，俾高射砲能够準確命中，或派機隊前往截擊。又有一種名叫「活動探照機」能於飛機在上空飛過時，把它照現使，一點不能隱藏。</p>

<p>舊報新抄　六十七年前（四八六）　（見遜清同治十二年本報）</p>
<p>— 三江文派</p>
<p>科塲文字，前輩皆以風氣論之，誠哉楚言！蓋八股文字，不比策論表判詩賦等作，必有一定範圍，雖矜才使氣，仍依規矩行之，故學之者如婦人之描花樣焉，自幼至長，功夫有精進之候，而法總不易也。旣如花樣，則翻陳出新，變化無窮，一時行之，萬人效之，苟不成，則不合式也。自明初設制科，首塲試四書文七篇，今改三篇。明初之文，聲希味淡，篇中有數句，緊搏全題闡發意義者，卽推傑作。至成宏正嘉而稍變矣，緊鍊之處漸多，落句矜重，措意艱深，蓋從純樸而至於華美者也。旣而隆萬又變矣，天崇又變矣，大抵華美之中，略加修飾，詣又一進。迨國初則稱極盛，文質相宣，虛實兼到，體格亦漸新麗。至於雍乾之際，則又醇乎其醇，寬博暢茂，勻整均齊，時文之能事，至此而畢。於是物極則變，純正之後，間以新奇，由是愈趨愈下，出題則避庸熟，割截無理；行文則標新異，節外生枝。排偶之體，又漸不用；典贍之詞，概從删抹。</p>

<h3>貢獻給將近開學的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>小朋友們！在這動盪不定的大時代中，我們的學校又將開學了，在開學前，來檢討一下我們的假期生活，是否過得有意義，我們的身體學業是否有長進，假期作業有多少成績。同時要想到在全國有成千成萬的兒童，沒有機會求學，又有許多好學的兒童，因暑期補習學校的停辦而失學，我們仍能上學求學，還不勉强，還不奮進，豈不慚愧嗎？</p>
<p>在學期開始時，小朋友們又要相見，免不了一番熱鬧與歡樂，而不知這學期的學費，因物價騰貴也加了價，父母如何焦急的籌劃着。加以小朋友不肯愛護物品，除了買新書外，還要添辦課業用品，可是這些物品都漲了價，就是最劣的五分簿也要一元多一打。因此父母們又加重了負担，小朋友如再不知愛惜，不知節有，到無力購買時，懊悔也來不及了。</p>
<p>以下夾講講課業用品節省的方法：</p>
<p>一•書包：以自己做爲要，因爲向市上買，他們除布價外，還要加上手工費，於是格外貴了。自己做的時候，只要布一塊，隨心所欲，做各種形式。喜美觀的，在袋角繡花或貼布。布料如竹布斜紋布不易汚的如深色的士林布，比買的經久耐用得多了。</p>
<p>二•書本：小朋友們讀的書，紙張都是很薄的，如不愛護，沒有幾天就要壞的，所以在我們買新書後，立刻用包書紙包好，隨破隨換，同時我們不要在書上亂塗，讀後平放在一定地方，如此，我們的書本用到學期完畢，一定還是新的。</p>
<p>三•鉛筆：不宜寫得尖而長，太尖太長，就易撇斷，很不經用。</p>
<p>四•紙：小朋友要革除換紙的習慣，我們在開始寫的時候，就要存着寫得好的觀念，有時不留意寫錯了，我們在旁做記號作廢，監督自己不換一紙，以後就自然而然會寫得好了。</p>
<p>書包書本鉛筆紙張是課業用品中主要物件，我略述一些節省方法，其他如橡皮刀片之類，也要愛惜，這一些小小意思貢獻於開學或未開學的小朋友們，希望你們切實的去實行。</p>
<h3>為整理暑期作業向教師們進一言</h3>
<p>— 兪兪</p>
<p>孩子究竟是孩子，無論做什麼工作，不溶易有持久性，希望孩子的工作有成績，全靠諸位老師的循循善誘。現在暑期行將過去，各校都快要開學了，我爲了暑期作業競賽，特地向諸位老師提出一個建議。開學後一星期內，着重在暑期作業的整理，如果發見沒有做完的孩子，鼓勵他從速補做，先來一個各級暑期作業成績交卷人數的比賽，那一級交卷的人數最多，給他們一面模範學級的獎旗，道是輕而易舉的事，利用孩子好勝心理，完成暑期作業，有百利而無一弊。共次把各級著期作業試卷，在校內舉行一次展覽會，函請各家長到校參觀，表示學校對於暑期作業的認眞，不失爲取得家長信仰心的一法。當然，最好的辦法，暑期作業，不但要展覽，而且要評判，成績優良的，由學校給他一些獎勵，這也是惠而不費的辦法。然後彙集起來，在九月十五日以前，由學校送到本報館總管理處。中間如交卷人數比賽，成績展覽會，都可以做聯貫性的設計單元，丟開暑期作業競賽的本身價值不談，單就這些事項論，在敎育上也有相當的效用，我相信諸位老師，早已想到，早已計畫到了。</p>
<h3>砲轟</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>日前報載「英國南海岸遭德國長射程大砲轟擊，兩毘運民屋之頂樓被炸塌，隣近之屋頂亦彈片有若雨下，半英里圓周內之窗戶均受震破……」這一段消息，在庸兒的眼中瞟過，却引起了他的注意。</p>
<p>「在法國海岸的德國大砲居然能轟擊到英國的境界，現代的軍器眞是精益求精，這種大砲不知是怎樣的龐大呢。」他看完了這段消息，便呆呆地想着，更把這消息去告知他父親，並且請他老人家講些關於這種大砲的概况，而他哥哥宗兒在這時也走了過來。</p>
<p>「這種長射程大砲，在西歷一九一八年，就是歐洲第一次大戰快將結束的那一年，巳由德國陸軍參謀部發明。那發明的動機是因英法兩國空軍非常活躍，德國到各地去空襲失了效用，於是想出用一種砲攻的方法，要把砲彈轟擊到法國的首都巴黎，這不過是理想罷了。那知理想竟變成了事實，被德國的砲兵偶然地發現了，那砲的口徑是很大，而砲身和地面所成的角度也非常大，幾乎把砲身直竪在地面上，這樣開出去砲彈的高度比平常增加了二倍多，也就是砲彈急速地向上空直射過去，於是在一九一八年的夏天，巴黎便受到了三百多個砲彈的轟擊。這種大砲的構造，德國很秘密地不把它公布，後來不知怎的又公開地發表了：那砲的重量的七百五十噸，而砲管是粗大的鋼管，厚達一米多，長有三四米，砲彈殼也有一米多長，重約三百磅左右，彈殼裏裝着四百磅的火藥，所以一砲射出去，那砲彈爆裂的力量，已有七萬磅左右的壓力，再加上了砲彈的重量，便不堪設想了。那砲彈旣是這麼地重，而怎能射到很遠的距離呢？那大砲用機械的力量使和地面成一適當地角度，於是把砲彈射出去，在剛出砲口的刹那速度是達到每秒二千米，這時空氣的抵抗力也愈大，不過總敵不過砲彈的力量。這樣快的速度，就是要使砲彈達到極高的上空層，那裏的空氣稀薄，抵抗力也减少，於是使砲彈更可射到極遠的距離，然後那砲彈急輛落下，在目的地爆炸開來。至於怎麼能射中目的地？那有軍事專家在事前有一番精密的計算。這不過是二十多年以前的事情，到了現代，那長射程大砲差不多各國都有，而且比以前更精密得多了。」</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（十三）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>當初我們的身子，高度不過三十六英寸，如今却漸漸地高了起來，就是我個人已高到四十英寸，別的孩子們，竟有比我更高的。像我們這樣的高度，再做嬰兒，實在說不過去，所以我們那套「嬰兒把戲」的一本頭影片，就這樣結束了•我戀戀不捨似的，向那些小朋友們道別；我們合作了一年多的時光，彼此相親相愛，都成了好朋友，並且我們也常在一塊兒玩耍。</p>
<p>內中有一個小女郎，是我所最最歡喜的。我和伊相見的時光最多，每逢我拍攝影片時，伊也常常和我在一起，先前我拍攝「起立歡呼」「小將軍」「小叛徒」等影片。伊沒一次不到，料想將來拍攝別的影片時，也是如此。可甘，你知道是什麼緣故，因爲伊是我的代表。</p>
<p>如今待我來和你講明怎麼叫做代表呢？原來伊的身材和我是相同的，穿的衣服，也就是我在影片中所穿的衣服。伊和我好像是一對雙生姊妹，不過面貌是不一定要一模一樣的。至於這代表做些什麼工作，我也得和你說個明白。本來我對於道一回事，也莫明其妙，全仗我那好友傑密鄧恩告知我的。每逢我要拍攝一塲戲時，那班攝影人，收音人和打光人，都要在事前試騐一下。那攝影人兒要主演人坐在規定的地位，好供他校準鏡頭，臨時就不致有鏡頭不準的弊病。收間人和打光人也一樣的要你坐在規定的地方，先做一番預備的工夫。</p>
<p>可是主演人在正式上鏡頭之前，往往是很忙的那有工夫老坐着讓他們試騐。伊在化妝室中先得梳梳頭髮，整整衣服，或是要跳跳新的舞步，唱唱新的歌曲，都是在這新影片中所需要的。然而你雖沒有工夫，那班攝影人們都總是要試騐一下的，於是不得不睛一個代表來代表一切。不過據我想來，這也是一種很苦的工作，因爲試騐的時間很長，你往往靜坐着，不能動一動，火熱的燈光，始終照着你，幾乎使你張不開眼睛來。</p>
<h3>一封討論寫字的信（上）</h3>
<p>— 何仁</p>
<p>華弟明妹：</p>
<p>剛接到你們的來信，便聽得空襲警報，匆匆忙忙袋着你們的信，帶了些緊要的東西，躱到防空洞裏去。就著暗淡的燈光勉强把你們的信讀完了。你們能够平平安安在家裏談談書，寫寫字，在目前的中國，是多麼難得的特別機會，千萬別輕輕放去；應該格外努力向前猛進，方不負千千萬萬冒萬險，拼命奮鬥的人。——你們須時時刻記住，他們的冒着萬險，拚命奮鬥，也是爲着你們啊！　閒話休提，言歸正傳·——你們在暑期內，對於寫宇，特別高興，所以特地寫信來，和我討論練習方法。不過你們問：怎麼樣練習才最有效，這可有些難於答覆。方法雖好，有效與吾，還得靠着你們自己努力呢，　我目前學的功課，有一種就是講怎樣敎小學生一，其中有一部分就講到「怎樣敎小學生練習寫字。」現在我就把讀書心得寫出來，倒可以供你們一個參攷：</p>
<p>（一）先要寫不錯，寫得整齊寫得快。小學生練習寫字，最緊要是講求實用。第一步要寫得個個字正確，不多一筆，也不漏去一筆，更不致形體顛倒反裝。第二步要寫得一行一行能够整齊筆直。第三步，不但要寫得淸楚，一看便知，而且還要看起來不討厭，不過在現代世界中，事情要幹得快，字當然也要寫得快。</p>
<p>（二）練習寫字，不一定路路臨帖我們一提起練習寫字，便聯想到臨帖。其實小學生練習寫字何必一定要臨帖。譬如你們幼時讀過的初級敎科書，上面的字個個是很好的楷書，大可以照着寫，廢物利用，一舉兩得。又如大人們寫的信叫便條，馬路上的招貼學校裏的佈浩，報上的廣告等等，不少是字寫得很好。只要隨處留心，不息缺少足供練習的材料。</p>

<p>這是一個淸晨，霞卿女士，晨裝初理，頭髮由四週上捲作半弧形，灰綠色淡紅花的陲衣，上面加上一件淡緣色的披肩，看上去玲瓏之至。皮膚很細膩，口像一顆初熟的櫻桃，瓜子臉兒，彎彎的眉毛，身軀碩長，一望而知是位典型的廣東女子。</p>
<p>我和她通了姓名，她便含笑地讓我進去，房內的陳設是純西式。她一面把沙發上的報紙拿開，一面便頻頻讓坐，那裏好像是她的一個安適的家，旣平靜又溫和。</p>
<p>她坐定了後，便等着客人的發問，眼珠兒一霎一霎的轉動，看出是個聰敏而勇敢的女人。</p>
<p>於是我便問她小時從影的回憶？到過多少地方？從前在那裏學航空的？在外國住過幾年？最近是否在著作？將來的希望等等……</p>
<p>下面便是她的回答。。</p>
<p>「提起我上銀幕的事，已經不很感到興趣，那時藝名「李旦旦」，但不多幾年，漫游歐美，便把「旦旦」的藝名廢棄，改用今名，所以我從影時期，簡直無足回憶的了。</p>
<p>「我在歐洲曾住過四年，在美國一年。學習航空是在瑞士，期限是四年。因爲瑞士和法國比隣，所以也常到法國去，亦歐美兩洲，凡是有航綫的地方，大都去過了。</p>
<p>「關於著作，慚愧得很，生平只寫作過一本“The　Romance　of　AirwaysinChina”這書的內容是專論航空上的一切，和自己對於航空的經騐，以及提倡航空發展航空事業的必要。如果時間許可，最近還想寫一本「全美飛行記」，這，也許你以爲我太胆大吧！</p>
<p>「至於我將來的希望，是能飛盡世界上的每個角落，這樣不但對自己所學有了眞正的發展，滿足向日的志願，卽是對中國的航空事業亦有絕大的宣傳。不但如此，並且希望終身爲航空界努力，更希望每個中國人都有豐富的航空智識，增加國防上的力量。</p>
<p>最後，我問她是否還有意在好萊塢繼續拍片？她突然面紅耳赤，慊然不樂，好像對她有了一種絕大的侮辱似的。她說：「我這决和桃樂姍拉摩小姐合演「航空爭雄“Disp　uted　Passage”一方面爲了提倡航空，一方面將拍片所得，寄問祖國，充作捐款。絕無再上銀幕的意志，此後，將繼續募款，直到抗建勝利爲目的。」</p>
<h3>演員私生活　有嚴肅的必要</h3>
<p>國聯爲提拔新人計，兩月前曾招考男女見習生二十餘名，希望彼等能於見習期內，用心揣摹，然後再予以演戲機會，不料其中有少數份子，以爲一蒙錄取，儼然已是明星，並不刻苦研習，而終日出入於歌臺舞榭，頗予人以不良印象，茲聞國聯當局認爲此少數份子，實已不堪造就，將予解雇，海星社記者昨日曾以此詢諸國聯劇務主任韓蘭根，據謂當局或將如此辦理，但未完全决定耳。記者以爲電影演員私生活，實有嚴肅必要，彼不能悔過自新者，縱有天才演技，棄之亦不足惜。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>他又說道：「我又發了一個電報到蘇州警廳裏去，調查李守琦的行踪。」</p>
<p>我詫異地問：「李守琦？他是誰？」</p>
<p>「他是李芝範的兒子，死者的表兄，在十七日到上海，在麗蘭家裏過了一衣，十八早晨就回蘇州的。據霍先生說：這個人和死者或許也有些關係。因此，我在臨走的時候問過那老頭兒，他說他的兒子在蘇州養育小學做敎員，所以我打一個電報去問問，如果他眞在十八日日間到蘇州的，那我們也可少掉個嫌疑的人，偵查時也可以把目光集中，不必分心太多。一他頃了一頓，又補充一句：「據我看來，眼前這姓余和姓趙的嫌疑都很重，委實用不着分心到旁的人身上去。」</p>
<p>我點點頭。「這一點我也同意。此外還有沒有別的情報？」</p>
<p>倪金應道：「有個二〇二號警士，昨夜十一點到二點派在大同路崗位。據他報告，昨夜十二點鐘前後，眞有一輛黑色的汽車，停在相近靑蒲路轉角的大同路上。」</p>
<p>我不禁挿口說：這樣，老毛的話果然設實了。」</p>
<p>倪金壽應道：「是的，那二〇二號在同一時間，還瞧見另外一輛汽車，停在靑蒲路空地的西面，距離這二十七號祇有三四個門面。我看這一輛汽車也有關係。」</p>
<p>我急忙應道：「那當然。他可會注意汽車的號碼？」</p>
<p>倪金壽道：「沒有，不過那綠角汽車，很像是出差車子，調查起來還不難。我也巳派人在這方面進行。」　（八六）</p>

They are also issued "Good Citizen Certificates," costing 60 yuan for wealthy households, 10 yuan for middle-class households, and 5 yuan for poor households.

<h3>Chen Cheng Receives the Press, Discusses the Future War Situation, Strict Sanctions Will Be Imposed on Hoarding</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At a tea party for the Chinese press yesterday, Chen Cheng delivered a lengthy speech, reporting on the progress of the Battle of Yichang and announcing that he had received permission to resign from all rear-area positions in order to focus on his responsibilities in the war zone. Regarding the future war situation, Chen Cheng stressed that the Japanese are still urgently seeking to resolve the China issue, but all means have been exhausted, so there may be a final desperate attempt. On our side, regardless of whether the Japanese come or not, we should be actively prepared. Considering the various conditions, if the Japanese attack, we welcome it. Even if they do not attack, we will counterattack. Finally, regarding the issue of prices, Chen Cheng pointed out that the reasons for the surge are hoarding and difficulties in transportation. Regarding the former, Chen Cheng believes that judging from the international situation, the enemy's situation, and our own conditions, it is not difficult to conclude that the war will be successful within a year. At that time, the goods hoarded by unscrupulous merchants will be impossible to sell. Hoarding is foolish. Moreover, the war of resistance is a revolution. When necessary, we may use revolutionary means to deal with these fools. Regarding the difficulty in transportation, Chen Cheng used rice prices as an example, believing that the fundamental solution is to drastically disperse the personnel of various agencies to enable them to obtain food locally (Havas Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<h3>Panic in Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping: There is great panic here today because the Chinese mobile troops have threatened the railway between Beiping and Tianjin. Although traffic on that section has been restored today, the city gates on the east side of Beiping were all closed this morning. Due to the activities of the mobile troops near Beiping and the Eighth Route Army's attacks on transportation in Shanxi and Hebei, residents of Beiping are quite frightened and it is heard that the Eighth Route Army has occupied Qizhou (Associated Press Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Designates Bank of China as the Agency for Exchanging British Currency; Orders Holders of British Banknotes to Exchange Them for Legal Tender at Local Branches of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The British government recently promulgated a law restricting the British pound banknotes issued by the Bank of England, requiring them to be sent back to the Bank of England for clearing before August 17th of this year. After August 27th of this year, these British pound banknotes may not be returned to the UK for clearing. The Hong Kong government has implemented this in accordance with the British law. In order to protect the interests of the Chinese people holding these British pound banknotes, the Ministry of Finance has designated the Bank of China's branches as agencies for exchanging British pound banknotes for legal tender, so that they can be collected and transported to the central bank. In addition to ordering the Bank of China to handle the exchange, it is also announced to the public that all citizens holding British pound banknotes issued by the Bank of England must exchange them for legal tender at local branches of the Bank of China before the 26th of this month to avoid losses. The time is pressing, so please do not hesitate and make a mistake (Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<p>Chongqing: Since the British government announced the prohibition of the Bank of England's banknotes from being shipped back to the country from Shanghai to prevent Germany and Italy from profiting from it, the Chinese Ministry of Finance issued an order to all branches and offices of the Bank of China last night, instructing them to continue to exchange these banknotes as usual until the 26th of this month to protect the interests of Chinese note holders (Havas Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<h3>Chinese Impression of the British Prime Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Chongqing: British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on August 20th has made a profound impression in Chongqing. According to sources close to the government, Churchill said in his speech: "Our purpose is to faithfully and resolutely fulfill all responsibilities and obligations in all parts of the world." The Far East is one of the important parts of the world. Since the British Prime Minister is determined to fulfill Britain's responsibilities and obligations in all parts of the world, Britain will naturally not neglect its responsibilities and obligations to the Far East, especially to China. It is generally believed that under the British Prime Minister's serious statement, the recent Burma Agreement concluded between Britain and Japan will not be renewed after the three-month period expires (Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<p>Chongqing: A senior Chinese official recently told Reuters that British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons has made a deep impression on the Chinese side here. They have all paid close attention to Churchill's statement that "We intend to faithfully and resolutely fulfill our obligations and responsibilities throughout the world." This statement has strengthened the hope that Britain will not continue to neglect its obligations and responsibilities to China, and that the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the Burma Road will not be continued after its expiration (Reuters Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<h3>Hebei Education Department Relieves Unemployed Youth</h3>

In order to provide relief to staff and students from the province who have come from the war zone, a Hebei Provincial School Staff and Student Reception Center has been set up in Yichuan to provide food and accommodation, and they are sent out at every opportunity to seek advancement. For the existing Hebei students above the junior college level, because their hometowns have fallen and their economic sources have been cut off, for the sake of relief, letters have been sent to various schools to investigate the number of people and their living conditions to provide a basis for subsidies, so that they may know the central government's kindness (Telegraph from the 24th).</p>

<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Orders Various Agencies in Chongqing to Withdraw to the Countryside; Only a Few Offices Are Allowed to Remain; Garrison Headquarters Ordered to Implement</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Test of Bombing Chongqing</h3>
<p>A week ago, this newspaper discussed the Japanese side's published statistics on the bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese Air Force in the three months after May 18th, and compared them to the air war between Britain and Germany. Afterwards, we continued to receive telegrams from Chongqing stating that the Japanese army continued to bomb, dropping mostly incendiary bombs, and it was reported that almost four-fifths of the Chongqing urban area was destroyed, and nearly ten thousand citizens lost their homes and had nowhere to go. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, grieving the citizens' tragic suffering, ordered the allocation of one million yuan for emergency relief. Recently, the Chinese government issued a statement saying that in the three months, a total of 64 Japanese aircraft were shot down, and it was estimated that the Japanese side spent as much as 47 million US dollars bombing Chongqing, while Chongqing's losses were worth about 1 million US dollars. The number of people killed was 2,051, and the number of injured was 3,479. According to neutral observers, Chongqing's losses are undoubtedly considerable, but in any case, they are not as great as the Japanese side's waste. It is also rumored that the National Government has moved away from this ruined wartime capital, which the National Government has denied. All these recent reports must be remembered by those who sympathize with China's war of resistance and construction and care about the officials and people of Chongqing. However, this is also a good test, and soon facts will provide a clear answer.</p>
<p>Chongqing was the State of Ba in the Zhou Dynasty and Ba County in the Qin and Han Dynasties. It is a pity that this ancient city with more than 3,000 years of history has been almost completely destroyed due to foreign aggression; and more than 5,000 people have been killed and injured, and the number of homeless people will be doubled. This is the ultimate tragedy for humanity. Moreover, the reason why the war of resistance and national construction is justified is that it has suffered this unexpected disaster hundreds of miles behind the front line due to the comparative backwardness of military preparations. This is especially deeply lamented by those with a sense of justice. What can be tolerated is that on the day the country is at war, the devastation of cities and fields, and the sacrifice of life and property, whether it is 5,000 people or hundreds of thousands of people, whether it is four-fifths of a place or the entire place being razed to the ground, whether it is worth one million or tens of millions, is not unusual. After all, war is fundamentally a tragedy, a destructive act; for those who are sacrificed, those who are devastated, for justice, for independence and freedom, for the country, for future generations, they will of course endure the pain and never yield. Moreover, they are prepared to endure from the beginning of their determination to fight, and they will not regret it at the time of winning victory. Moreover, compared with the occupied areas, Chongqing has suffered damage to the ground, while the occupied areas have suffered damage to the land, air, and underground treasures. More than 5,000 people have been killed and injured in Chongqing, while the number of people killed and injured in the occupied areas is countless. The citizens of Chongqing have lost their possessions, while the people in the occupied areas have almost lost their eyesight, mind, and soul. Chongqing has indeed suffered deep pain, and those who hear about it far and wide will sympathize with it. However, the people in the occupied areas are hoping that Chongqing will be able to relieve their suffering!</p>
<p>After the disaster, is Chongqing only one-fifth of what the Japanese side ideally targeted? The Japanese side bombed Chongqing, saying that it must be completely destroyed. Now that four-fifths have been destroyed, and the most severe destruction has been achieved in recent days, is the complete destruction not far away? The Japanese side said that destroying Chongqing is to destroy the political power of the National Government, and it is to destroy the policy of war of resistance and national construction; then in the near future, if Chongqing is completely razed to the ground, will Japan's great desire to conquer China and its attempt to quickly end the so-called China Incident not be fulfilled? The Japanese side said this so loudly that it ignored the world's condemnation of the bombing of Chongqing, saying that it must move forward in this way to achieve its established national policy. Those who argue against it, those who know it criticize it, but the Japanese side not only retorts, but also boasts about the great results of the bombing. Now, Chongqing is on the verge of complete destruction. Empty words are boring, and soon we will be able to get evidence from the facts. Who wants to predict the facts to come? However, is the bombing of Chongqing completely devoid of military value, and is it only a violation of humanity, only a manifestation of barbarism, only a manifestation of cruelty and ruthlessness, so that even if Chongqing is destroyed, it will not change the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War? Can it really achieve the effect of destroying materials and frustrating the spirit, so that the National Government will give up the war of resistance and destroy it? This test, with the facts to come, is placed before the Japanese and open to the people of the world. What is the answer?</p>
<h3>The US Reaffirms a Severe Attitude Toward Aggressor Nations; Opposes Japan's Current East Asia Policy; All Outstanding Issues Will Eventually Be Settled</h3>
<p>Washington: According to news here last night, the US government submitted a strong note to Tokyo two weeks ago. This note was a warning to the Japanese government, opposing Japan's current policy in East Asia. The State Department currently refuses to comment on this news, but Japanese Ambassador to the US Kensuke Horiuchi, who has been summoned back to his country, shows that the Japanese government has recently received a note from the US government. The note was the US response to Japan's protest against the ban on the export of US oil and scrap iron to Japan. US officials refused to confirm or deny the news that Secretary of State Hull's memorandum to Horiuchi detailed the outstanding issues between the US and Japan. It is learned that the memorandum included special criticisms regarding the situation of American expatriates in China and the American commercial situation in China. In addition to reviewing the unresolved cases between Tokyo and Washington, the memorandum also warned Japan that the US has not forgotten the various cases, and the day of reckoning will come. Observers recalled that Horiuchi had a meeting with US Acting Secretary of State Welles on August 9, and informed sources claimed that Welles may have explained Hull's attitude to Horiuchi at that time. Earlier, Japan strongly protested President Roosevelt's announcement banning the export of aircraft gasoline and scrap iron to foreign countries, including Japan. It is widely believed that the US may have used the note responding to Japan's protest to reaffirm the US's severe attitude toward aggressor nations. The content of Japan's protest to the US and the US's reply have not been released here. Welles stated yesterday that in order to preserve diplomatic courtesy, whether or not to release the above protest and reply must follow the Japanese government's opinion.</p>
<p>Horiuchi Stays in Washington Temporarily, Refuses to Talk About US-Japan Relations: Horiuchi notified Hull yesterday that he had been summoned back to his country. He did not yet know the surname of his successor. He will stay in Washington until the new ambassador arrives. After visiting Hull, Horiuchi refused to discuss Japan-US relations. He said that he did not hand over any Japanese note to Hull in person (Associated Press Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of State Hull returned to Washington yesterday to attend a cabinet meeting. His three-week vacation was obviously not over. Hull told reporters yesterday that he could not mention anything regarding current affairs because he had been in contact with Kume (Haitong News Agency Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the Japanese Foreign Minister's recall of 40 overseas representatives, the Asahi Shimbun stated, "This step is to eliminate pro-US elements.

<p>Washington: The Department of Commerce released a report from a certain Japanese newspaper, saying that a certain Japanese person who recently returned from Rio de Janeiro after consulting with local Japanese diplomats claimed that he could not feel optimistic about Japan and Latin America increasing commerce. The Department of Commerce here, according to Japanese newspaper news, Japanese officials even proposed restricting trade between Japan and Latin America, because most of the raw materials needed by the Americas are chemicals and factory equipment, which Japan cannot easily supply. However, the Department of Commerce also stated that as a result of the talks in Brazil, Japan is carefully studying the establishment of a permanent government trade agency with Latin America (Associated Press Telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<h3>US Conscription Bill: Senate Reopens Debate; Roosevelt Urges Swift Passage; National Guard Mobilization Planned</h3>
<p>Washington - Following the passage of the National Guard Mobilization Act, the US Senate yesterday reopened debate on the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill. Wisconsin Republican Senator Wiley declared that even if the conscription bill passes, the United States will not necessarily be drawn into war. The decision on war depends, firstly, on Hitler's actions; secondly, on the attitude of the American public; and thirdly, on the decisions of American political leaders. "We deeply understand that once Britain falls, the flames of war may spread to the Americas, at which time we may have to go out and put out the fire." (United Press International dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday urged the swift passage of the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill, which is currently being debated in Congress, as it is essential for national defense. The President told the press that national defense must begin within two weeks. Many defense deployments will be completed in the autumn. These deployments are useless if no one uses them. Yesterday, the Senate passed a bill authorizing the President to mobilize 360,000 National Guard and Reserve troops for one year of intensive military training and sent it to the White House. The President, based on this bill, can dispatch defense forces and reserve troops to any place in the Western Hemisphere or to American territories such as the Philippines. The President will sign the bill today, and once signed, it will become law. President Roosevelt told the press that based on the current number of volunteers, 400,000 people can be mobilized in one year. These 400,000 people are necessary to strengthen the regular army and the National Guard. However, in another year, another 400,000 people should be mobilized to meet the need to build an appropriate defense organization. If this huge and organized army is not established by the spring, the entire national defense program cannot proceed according to schedule. There are many military supplies and equipment that can be used by conscripted soldiers. In addition to training in the use of rifles, these conscripted soldiers must also receive training in the use of various other equipment. The President specifically mentioned the need for people to use portable wireless radios and explained the necessity of cooperation between air and ground forces. However, training in this cooperation is still in its preliminary stages in the army. If the military needs 100 people with this skill, but there are only 10 people who have been trained, it is still useless, because the army must be tightly organized and strong. (United Press International dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Barkley, the majority leader, convened a meeting after the Senate failed to approve various amendments to the conscription bill. It is also rumored that President Roosevelt, now that the National Guard bill has been passed, is planning to mobilize 55,000 people on September 15, 55,000 people on October 15, 65,000 people on November 15, and 40,000 people in December for military service.

<h3>Japan Admits China Is Not Conquered; Long-Term War Against China Still a Failure</h3>
<p>New York - The New York Times editorial today stated that Japan's recent political eruption contains a clear admission that the long-term war against China has, to this day, been a failure. This move has the stench of a last-ditch effort and acknowledges the obvious fact that although many valuable parts of China have fallen into Japanese hands, China has not been conquered.

Many foreigners enter the country with temporary passports and then hire lawyers to obtain permanent residency permits. It is hard to guarantee that these people do not aim to destroy the Panama Canal, the lifeline of US national defense. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>New York - The New York Times' Washington correspondent stated that there is now a proposal in Congress gaining considerable support regarding the lease of British Atlantic bases to the United States. It is presented to President Roosevelt, advocating the cancellation of Britain's war debts to the United States as suitable compensation for 99-year leases on eighteen sites suitable for naval bases.

<h3>Japan to Make New Demands on the Dutch East Indies; Cabinet Sends Kobayashi as Special Envoy to the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>London - British sources here predicted yesterday that the Japanese will make new demands on the Dutch East Indies, to transfer mineral resources to Japan and recognize Japan's future right to oversee the production of nickel and chromium there. It is also believed that Japan will soon demand general economic expansion and various freedoms for immigration to the Dutch East Indies. These demands will closely follow the forced abandonment of trade negotiations between Britain and Japan due to the burden of the European war. Japan is now forced to find ways to obtain various raw materials elsewhere, because this year Japan has not been able to obtain nickel and copper from Canada. Apart from obtaining a small amount of scrap iron from India, Japan has not been able to obtain the required materials from Britain. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The government recently consulted with General Koiso and others, asking him to undertake the mission to the Dutch East Indies. According to a statement issued today by Cabinet Secretary General Tomita, it has been informally decided to send Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi as a special envoy to the Dutch East Indies. Kobayashi is a giant in the business world, usually engaged in the operation of electrical utilities, and has a high reputation.

<h3>African British-Italian War Entering Decisive Phase; Italy Launches Aerial Offensive Against Ethiopia as Prelude to Land Attack</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper recently commented on the African war situation, saying, "The preliminary war in Africa is about to end. The Italian side intends to carry out large-scale operations in both Libya and Sudan. In Sudan, Italian troops have broken into the enemy's lines. It is worth noting that a small number of isolated Italian troops are even more active than British soldiers. After winning in Somaliland, the southern Italian troops concentrated all their forces and launched a general attack on Khartoum, heading straight down the Nile River to avoid being surrounded. At the same time, Italian troops stationed in North Africa will take decisive action in Egypt, seizing the Suez Canal. The British army will take a defensive posture. We expect the African war situation to enter a decisive phase, although the fate of Egypt, Sudan, and other British colonies will still be determined by the Battle of the Straits." (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome - Well-informed sources here say that after Italian aircraft heavily bombed Egypt and Sudan, it is believed that the Italian Air Force has launched an aerial blitz against Egypt and Sudan as a prelude to a land attack. The Italian official gazette stated that Italian aircraft had carried out heavy and prolonged bombing of Sidi Barrani, Marsa Matruh, and Alexandria. These places are all located in Egypt. According to the gazette, this bombing was carried out after the Egyptian government decided to send Egyptian troops to join forces with British troops to defend Egyptian territory. The gazette first announced that Italian aircraft had bombed Khartoum, the capital of British Sudan, claiming that the Italian Air Force had begun a systematic attempt to destroy Khartoum's airfields and cripple British troops in Sudan, and claiming that Khartoum's aircraft hangars had been severely damaged by bombs and fire. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome - There is rejoicing here over the heavy Italian air raids on the port of Alexandria and the Italian aircraft attacks on British convoys in the Mediterranean, claiming that the Italian offensive against Egypt is imminent. However, the official gazette reporting on the Italian military's actions cannot further clarify future plans. The official statement also said, "When Italian troops arrive in Egypt, they will not fight the Egyptian people, but will fight the British in Egypt." The official statement also declared, "If Egypt modifies its current judicial situation, its attitude towards Italy will also change," etc. (International dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Determined to Abide by Alliance Obligations; Will Not Hesitate to Cross Egyptian Border</p>
<p>London - The newspapers here all expressed enthusiastic praise for the Egyptian government's decision to fight if Italian troops cross the border. The "Daily Mail" reported that Mussolini's sweet words and threats have completely failed to prevent Egypt from hindering and violating its alliance treaty with Britain. The victory of British domestic and Middle East air forces has restored the other party's trust in our country's military strength. The British naval and air forces' combined strength in shattering the Bardia and Capuzzo forts has exposed the false propaganda of Rome and Berlin and proved that British strength is on the rise. Egypt has extremely strong strength to protect its territory against Mussolini's aggression. If fascist legions attempt to advance into a 150-mile waterless desert, they will encounter bombardment by British naval and air forces along the way. In addition to the troops under the command of General Wavell, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, currently on the battlefield, Egypt will be able to increase the deployment of an army equipped with modern weapons and a very large air force. Egypt has warned the people of the East that Italy threatens the entire civilized world. This is the spirit of resistance aroused by Mussolini's ambition. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Heavily Bomb Italian Military Base; Capuzzo Fort Regained and Lost</p>
<p>Cairo - (According to this question last night's news), British air forces yesterday heavily attacked Italian troops in East Africa, thwarting their advance. Four Italian aircraft were shot down, and many military bases were destroyed by bombing. The British Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force are making every effort to disrupt Italy's preparations for attacking Egypt and Aden over Libya and Somaliland. However, the communique acknowledged that the Capuzzo Fort, near the Egyptian border on the Libyan coast, was recaptured on August 17 with the assistance of the British Navy. British dive bombers bombed the Benghazi port, destroying one Italian submarine supply ship, one destroyer, and two submarines, and "severely damaged" a mechanized unit transportation center at an aircraft repair station and on a ship. All British aircraft returned safely. It was also reported that Mogadishu and Asab were also bombed. At the same time, it was heard that Italian aircraft had also raided the port of Alexandria three times, but were all driven back early by British troops, so the damage was very slight. (International Press Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to the Italian official news agency, authoritative sources mentioned the news circulating in Cairo that an Egyptian division had been stationed next to the British army to defend against Italian invasion, saying that if this statement were true, Italy could not remain silent for long. If Egypt decides to take the same steps as Britain and fight against Italy, then the current situation will change, and Italy will respond accordingly. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Turkey Watches the Development of the War; Confidence in Britain Increases</p>
<p>Ankara - The official mouthpiece "Ulus" newspaper stated that Turkish and all Arab people in the Near East, as a result of closely observing the development of the war, especially Britain's air victories, have seen a very obvious increase in their trust in Britain's ultimate victory. From this, it can be seen that conquering Britain is impossible. At present, Turkey's focus is on Egypt first, the attitude of the United States second, and the position of Spain third. The Turkish side fully understands that France's surrender has greatly increased Britain's difficulties in Egypt, but it greatly admires the British side's courage in deciding not to make unnecessary sacrifices in Somaliland, and believes that this move has greatly enhanced Britain's ability to hold Egypt to deal with the enemy. People here believe that the recent developments in the Americas and Spain are most favorable. Furthermore, news that the Soviet Union is dealing with Turkey in a more friendly manner is also encouraging. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Deploy on Albanian Border; Greece Eagerly Seeks Self-Defense; Rome Denies Forcing Greece to Abandon British Guarantee; If Greece Is Invaded, Britain Will Fulfill Promise of Assistance</h3>
<p>A Border Town in Greece - There is good reason to believe that Greece does not want to abolish the British guarantee. The Greek cabinet met last night, but the content of the discussion is unknown. Some sources say that regarding Italy's attitude towards Greece, Germany is still exerting its mitigating influence on Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London - Rome Wireless Radio announced today that Greek authorities have committed another murder in Albania. According to a report in an Albanian newspaper, a person was found hanged, initially regarded as suicide, but later investigation revealed that he had been murdered. The Italian news agency said that Roman officials did not admit that Italy had telegraphed Greece demanding the abolition of the British guarantee, nor had they heard that Britain was planning to occupy the islands of Corfu and Crete. However, if Greece uses its territory or territorial waters for Britain to fight against Italy, Italy will retaliate in full measure. Reuters diplomatic correspondents heard that Italy is using the Albanian incident as a basis for negotiations with Greece, which is more beneficial to Italy's position, because this matter is not directly related to Italy's prestige, and its pressure can be increased or decreased according to the political needs of the time. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Athens - According to reports, Italian mountain troops yesterday deployed in key passes in the Albanian mountains facing the Greek border, as Greece is waiting anxiously for the rapid deterioration of Greek-Italian relations. However, as of now, no skirmishes between reconnaissance troops have occurred. As a result of special consultations between the government and King George of Greece this morning, several levels of troops have been conscripted and will receive one month of training. The troops called into service include machine gun, searchlight, special soldiers, and mechanized units. At the same time, London authorities claimed yesterday, "Britain, no matter what the situation, will be faithful to its promise to Greece." They said that if Greece is attacked, Britain will do its best to provide military assistance. At the same time, the Greeks believe that in addition to British assistance, once invaded, the country will also be able to obtain assistance from Yugoslavia and Turkey. If Greece is occupied by Italian troops, Turkey's position in the Dardanelles will be extremely dangerous. It is generally believed here that although Greece has no national defense, it will be able to do its best to resist. Based on this spirit, the government will be able to obtain the support of the entire country. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tirana - According to news received here, over the past day, the Greek authorities in Cameria and Pindus have distributed firearms to Greek residents. The Greek gendarmerie has organized militia, and a colonel has arrived in Janina to command the Greek militia. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Rome - According to the Stefani news agency, the Romanian-Hungarian negotiations on Outer Transylvania have broken down again. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations on Outer Transylvania reopened in Turnu Severin yesterday. The Hungarian representative submitted his government's reply to the Romanian government's rejection of the Hungarian side's original demands. At present, the situation is rarely seen in which the prospect of a satisfactory outcome of the negotiations is gradually becoming bright. Romania's attitude of opposing any solution other than the exchange of residents has become strong. The newspapers have published the number of Romanian land forces guarding the border and the navy patrolling the Danube River. Correspondents in Berlin all acknowledged the unsatisfactory nature of the negotiations, but said that German officials hoped that major issues would be resolved as soon as possible. At the same time, in Outer Transylvania, the movement against ceding territory to Hungary is still on the rise. The Romanian-Hungarian border has gradually become restless. The authorities have ordered air defense, and all air defense shelters must be completed by September 15 at the latest. It is heard that the Hungarian side has not obtained Germany's support, and its original broad demands are expected to have been greatly modified. It is heard from responsible sources that the Hungarian side has inquired with Moscow about the Soviet Union's attitude towards Hungary's demands, and the Soviet Union told them that it was not interested in the development of Outer Transylvania.

There are countless stories of individual and team heroism. It is said that a famous British regiment joined forces with Indian troops to hold their ground against the fierce attacks of superior enemy forces and inflicted heavy casualties on them.

<h3>Anti-Jewish Movement Extends to France; Government to Promulgate Laws Regulating the Status of Jews</h3>
<p>Vichy: French political figures anticipate that the government will soon pass laws regulating the status of Jews in France. Recently, anti-Jewish riots have frequently occurred in various French cities. Simultaneously, French government radio stations have initiated a campaign against Jewish doctors. It is widely believed that Marshal Pétain will announce a special law regarding Jews. A French news agency close to the government recently published an article stating that the Jewish problem in France has become acute. The order protecting Jews issued on April 26, 1939, should be revoked. The article further claims that Jews dominate the legal, medical, journalistic, radio, and film industries. The People's Front government's policy of allowing a large number of Jews to enter the country, which led to problems with participation in the war, should be completely overturned. The anti-Jewish actions in various cities within France are expressions of the demand that the government promptly resolve the Jewish problem. (Haitong Electric Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>French Technician Invents Artificial Gasoline</h3>

It is said that Kirar purchased a small amount of inexpensive minerals near the power plant where he works and, using electricity, combined them to create this product. Therefore, the cost is quite low. (Havas News Agency Electric Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Flies Across the Channel, Bombards German Artillery Positions; Distant View of Fires Burning on the French Coast; Two Hundred German Aircraft Attack England Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>London: Before 9 PM last night, the lights of German anti-aircraft guns were seen flashing continuously across the English Channel near Boulogne, along several miles of the French coastline, indicating a major British air raid was imminent.

The main target was Cap Gris-Nez, and artillery positions near Audembert and Saint-Inglevert in that area were also bombed. Simultaneously, other bombers conducted their usual nighttime raids on German-occupied airfields along the northern coast and in central France, as well as extremely important locations in Germany. The German targets attacked that night included the petrol refineries in Politz, the aircraft factory in Frankfurt, the power station near Cologne, the high-explosives factory near Frankfurt, and the port of Duisburg on the Rhine River. Twenty-two airfields in Germany and occupied territories were also attacked. According to the Ministry of Aviation, all British bombers returned safely, except for one that was forced to land and its crew perished. (Reuters News Agency Electric Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>London: Hitler launched his aerial blitzkrieg tactic against England again today.

<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security announced that enemy aircraft conducted small-scale operations at night. Bombs fell in several areas of the southeast and southwest, as well as in one area of the Midlands and one area of South Wales. Property was damaged in the Midlands and South Wales, with minimal damage elsewhere. There were very few injuries and no fatalities. This morning, an air raid alert was issued in the London area. Public buses and trams continued to operate as usual, and people flocked to their offices. Other vehicles mostly stopped.

Last night's enemy attack lasted the longest in the Midlands area, where two to three hundred high-explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped. Anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense, and property was slightly damaged. There were no reports of deaths or injuries. Single enemy aircraft occasionally flew over a certain town in the southwest, dropping bombs that caused several deaths and injuries. (Reuters News Agency Electric Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military announced that the German Navy sank the British armed merchant ship "Turakina" (8,706 tons) in Australian waters. In the past eight days, German submarines have sunk over 100,000 tons of enemy cargo. One German submarine alone sank three British ships, with a total displacement of no less than 15,000 tons. Another submarine fired a torpedo, damaging an armed merchant ship (11,000 tons). Yesterday, German aircraft attacked ports and dockyard projects, aircraft factories, aircraft manufacturing plants, and military camps in central and eastern England day and night. The armory in Dumbarton was bombed during the day, with flames reaching the clouds and explosions shaking the distance.

<h3>German Long-Range Guns Bombard England Again; Three Loud Explosions Heard; Dover Area Shaken</h3>
<p>London: At 9 AM this morning, the Dover area was shaken by three loud explosions. It is believed that the shells were fired by German artillery units on the French coast. An alert was issued at the time, notifying people to take cover. No aircraft were seen or heard when the explosions occurred. (Reuters Electric Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that regarding the German shelling across the English Channel, military experts believe that the guns used by the Germans are approximately 12-inch caliber or slightly larger. We have long known that Germany possesses guns of this caliber. Although this type of German artillery warfare may not bring the war into a new stage, it clearly has considerable nuisance value. Military experts generally believe that the Germans may increase their shelling of the Channel escort convoys, or that the accuracy of their shelling may improve with practice. However, reviewing the results of yesterday's shelling, it can be asserted that the Nazi efforts to blockade the Channel with artillery fire will meet with the same failure as their recent aerial offensive.

<h3>The Balkans Become a Powder Keg Again</h3>
<p>The Balkan Peninsula has once again fallen into the dangerous situation of the past. For many years, it has been known as the powder keg of Europe. Armies travel on muddy roads, and great empires appear and disappear in a flash. Twenty-six years ago, incessant warfare erupted like a volcano in the Balkans. Neighboring powers vied for dominance, resulting in a global conflagration. Currently, the flames of war have first ignited elsewhere, but the threat of war is again reverberating in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Emergency decrees have spread from the Aegean Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. Troops march across uncultivated fields. Every night, several artillery units rumble westward along the rutted roads of Turkish Thrace. Bulgarian farmers trade homespun cloth for military uniforms, traveling north on shaky trains.</p>
<p>The Hungarian General Staff is hastily deploying troops to defend the plains near the Tisza River and the foothills of the Lesser Russian Mountains. Romania has been under martial law ever since it was forced to cede its eastern border provinces. Mobilization has been fully implemented, and every city is under nightly blackout restrictions to prevent danger.</p>
<p>And around this area, the great powers are all watching each other with jealousy. Soviet troops are moving ever closer to Germany, deploying along the Prut and Siret rivers, a short distance from the strategically important Danube Delta, and only half an hour by plane from Romania's abundant oilfields. Rumors of German mechanized units moving east are also rampant. On the Adriatic Sea, Albania and Istria, Italy is watching the restless peninsula with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, the Balkan Peninsula is similar to the situation at the beginning of this century, when the German and Russian empires both crossed the Danube River and came into contact with each other. At that time, the Russian sphere of influence extended to Serbia and as far as the Adriatic Sea, where the small kingdom of Montenegro, located before the European war, was located.</p>
<p>Kaiser Wilhelm II cleverly exploited the ambitious Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who hoped to create a South Slav state under Austrian protection. In this way, the unwieldy Austrian Empire was effectively controlled by Germany, and the interests of the opposing German and Russian states unfolded in small countries such as Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Signs of a similar situation are emerging again under modern, complex circumstances. The Soviet Union and Germany constantly declare that their relations are good, but the hidden situation is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>The current encroachment of these two countries on Eastern Europe, and the era when German power invaded Bosnia and Herzegovina through Austria in 1908, and when pro-Russian elements in Serbia assassinated a pro-German king and established a pro-Russian government, have many similarities.</p>
<p>The main countries with conflicting interests in the Balkans are currently Germany and the Soviet Union. Italy only occupies an important position because it is an ally of Germany, because Italy alone cannot play any role outside of the Mediterranean and Adriatic coasts. Britain and France once occupied a position in the Balkans using Turkey, but this position suddenly ended in June of this year.</p>
<p>Romania is currently the focal point of competition between opposing powers. Although some believe that the German-Soviet agreement last August included a rumored provision to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's timely move to occupy Bessarabia surprised Germany. This assumption is that the Soviet Union fears that after a crushing victory for Germany, it may not be as generous as it hopes, and that the Soviet Union believes that war between its neighbors is inevitable and must quickly obtain militarily valuable locations that are needed.</p>
<p>As the reporter is writing, Soviet troops are pouring into the occupied area. Some believe that the Soviet Union may want to occupy Moldavia and the Danube Delta, as well as Northern Dobruja, which could serve as a bridge to the Slavic nations of Bulgaria and South Slavs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Germany still wants to restrain ambitious Hungary, a country that has been constantly negotiating for the return of Outer Transylvania for twenty-one years, and whose army is now eager to seize the territory as its own. Bulgaria does not have such rash and reckless actions, because the Bulgarian government firmly believes that the lost province of Southern Dobruja should be returned to Bulgaria in any case, so it is not worth going to war over. It is believed that, during this period, Germany is unwilling to clash with the Soviet Union because it still has affairs with the British Empire.</p>
<p>Germany still needs supplies from the Balkan countries, so it does not need blind competition to disrupt Balkan traffic. Germany feels that once it can eliminate Britain, dealing with the Soviet Union is easy. Germans claim that they are fully prepared, because they only need to draw twenty-five divisions from the two hundred and forty divisions attacking France to meet the needs of attacking the British Isles. Even so, the Germans claim that it would be wiser to wait for an appropriate time before advancing east.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's direct threat to Germany is its air base, only half an hour's flight from the Romanian oilfields. If the Soviet Union occupies these oil wells with paratroopers and then occupies Moldavia, it can threaten Germany's needed fuel for the invasion of England. If Germany attacks it, the Soviet Union can destroy the oil wells and refineries.</p>
<p>The Romanian government is desperately turning to Germany, asking it to help prevent dangers on the eastern border. But at the moment, Germany does not seem willing to offend the Soviet Union and conclude a treaty with Romania, even if Romania fulfills all the necessary treaties and adjusts relations between Hungary and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The Balkans have once again become full of explosive primers. The current crisis may pass safely without exploding, or it may not. That depends on the Soviet Union. Opposing forces are active throughout the Balkans. The Bulgarian government is very pro-German, but its people are agitated by Soviet propaganda. Yugoslavia is restrained on the one hand by its Eastern blood ties, and on the other hand by the practical environment of its Western borders.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear whether the Soviet Union's goal is world revolution. But in any case, the tradition of Pan-Slavism is a good tool to resist Germany's eastward control of the East European continent. In both countries, there is a mixture of ideological formation and expansion of power. The coming days will see whether the flames in the Balkans are rising high, or whether it will not happen immediately, but the time is not very far away. (Translated from The New York Times)</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Force Dissolution of Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government has decided that all independent labor unions, if they do not "voluntarily" disband, will be forced to join the "Industrial Patriotic Association." Japan's military and economic problems are becoming increasingly acute due to the prolonged Sino-Japanese conflict. Therefore, it wants to encourage the patriotic enthusiasm of the people to a greater extent, in order to quickly solve these problems. However, whether Japanese labor unions will immediately dissolve is still uncertain, because the chairman of the Japanese labor union is not legally obliged to follow the dissolution proposal of the Japanese Minister of the Army. According to the chairman of the Japanese labor union, all Japanese workers can be patriotic, and it has nothing to do with whether Japanese workers are members of labor unions or the "Industrial Patriotic Association."

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates remained in a state of fluctuation. The previous day saw a slight easing, but yesterday it softened again. Although trading was active, there was no excitement. Market participants were indecisive, especially speculators who were constantly buying and selling, which had a significant impact.

Although the American banks Citibank and Chase, and the British bank Jardine Matheson, actively sold, the market trend was still softening.

<h3>Gold Market Advances, Gold Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold cash market and unofficial market showed an upward trend, with prices exceeding the $5,700 mark. Amid various new rumors, including the situation in Vietnam and France's impending submission to Japan, foreign exchange rates tightened, stimulating sentiment. With Tianjin assistance supplementing short positions, and stock market firms, banks, and gold shops advancing, retail investors pushed prices even higher, presenting a trend of rising prices that was difficult to reverse.

Gold shops sold twenty taels to banks, at $5,685. Subsequently, stock market firms initially delayed, but soon a certain bank also bought in succession, immediately breaking through the $5,700 mark.

<h3>銀錢業中　積習難改　少數不良分子　常使顧客難堪</h3>
<p>Bad Habits in the Banking Industry Are Hard to Change; A Few Unscrupulous Individuals Often Embarrass Customers</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an abundance of idle capital in this city, and the amount of legal tender has increased accordingly. In previous months, arbitrage on foreign exchange could reach 30-40%, but last month it was only about 10%. This month, because there is not much difference, the difference between this month's and next month's US dollar is only 0.03125, and the difference in British pounds is 0.015625. Arbitrage transactions have virtually stopped, and the use of cash has suddenly narrowed. As a result, a small number of banks, when presented with checks marked "cash" by customers, submit them to the paying bank for exchange or entrust them to the reserve for collection, but actually issue "only cash accepted" as the reason for returning the check. In fact, cash and clearing are originally the same thing. If "only cash accepted" is used as the reason for returning the check, it not only hinders the circulation of negotiable instruments, but also poses a great risk in the current state of this city. It is hoped that banks with such practices will no longer create difficulties. It would be best if the association notified its members to reiterate that cash and clearing are originally one and the same, and should not insist on customers accepting cash simply because there is a temporary lack of use for cash. However, when the demand for cash is strong, they fear that people will withdraw cash. Many in the banking industry only care about their own interests and make things difficult for customers, especially the tellers. Few bank employees have a calm attitude. Most are arrogant and indifferent to customers. Banks treat customers so poorly, and there will eventually be a day of retribution. Watching them leave in dismay, closing their doors, and regretting it will be too late. (English)</p>
<h3>中國二角新票　色澤素凈安閑</h3>
<p>New 20-Cent Chinese Note Features Simple and Elegant Colors</p>
<p>Because one-yuan banknotes and subsidiary currency notes are insufficient in this city, HSBC has specially transported one-yuan notes and 10-cent and 20-cent notes from Hong Kong to make adjustments. The design of the new 10-cent Chinese note has been detailed in this newspaper on the 22nd. Now, a new type of 20-cent note from the Bank of China has arrived. The front is light tan, and the back has green on both sides, with 20 and Twenty Cents printed in the middle, surrounded by brown-green edges. The colors are simple and elegant, offering a different flavor from the bright and dazzling 10-cent notes. (See attached picture for the design) It is rumored that the newly arrived one-yuan notes are the red notes of the fourth printing by the Central Bank, which can be exchanged at the reserve. The 10-cent notes will be accepted by HSBC and the Bank of China.</p>
<h3>英鎊票　可掉換支單　市場價已穩定</h3>
<p>Pound Notes Can Be Exchanged for Checks; Market Price Has Stabilized</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market was rising steadily, with British and American pounds also rising by one yuan each. The decline in pound notes has stopped, and the market price has suddenly rebounded. It is said that holders of pound notes can exchange them for checks at a certain British bank, but a handling fee is required. This has calmed people down, and holders are no longer eager to sell. The market price has risen to 53.50 yuan, an increase of 1.90 yuan compared to the previous day. US dollar notes followed the upward trend, reaching 17.92 yuan in the evening, an increase of 0.19 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a demand for Hong Kong notes, and the price rose by 0.02 yuan. The rise in Japanese yen notes and Korean notes has stopped, and the market price has stabilized. The former remains at 1.455 yuan, and the latter remains at 1.085 yuan.</p>
<h3>證券　內債又見轉機</h3>
<p>Securities: Domestic Debt Sees Another Turnaround</p>
<p>The securities grey market remained sluggish yesterday. However, the situation changed in the afternoon as a certain bank came in to absorb at low prices, and the bulls gradually lost their strength. Tongxinghao suddenly bought in large quantities at the close. After the close, it was heard that there were no problems with the US military taking over the defense of this port, and the grey market was slightly firmer. Yesterday's trading saw Jiufeng, Lianhe, and Lianyi buying throughout the morning and afternoon. Hongkang, Shunheng, and Hengfu also bought, but No. 38 turned to selling. The Xinfu bulls continued to sell, and Xieda and retail investors showed strong selling sentiment in the evening. In the morning, it was slightly down by 0.02-0.03 yuan, and in the afternoon, No. 38 bought domestic E shares cheaply. Zhongyi Trust bought in eagerly, and Yitai and Hongda also bought in. Tongxinghao suddenly bought in large quantities near the close, with Tongkang being the main seller. Hengfu sold slightly, and No. 20 also sold. As a result, it continued to fall slightly by 0.05-0.25 yuan, with E shares falling by only 0.05 yuan due to their low market price. The total turnover was around 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock trading saw 50 shares of the stock exchange being traded, with a price of 25 yuan per share.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Friday) - Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were generally calm. Only bank stocks showed a slight decline. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China shares fell 2 shillings and 6 pence to £6 5s. HSBC shares fell by half a pound each, with shares registered in England at £62 and shares registered in Hong Kong at £68. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米交易清淡</h3>
<p>Grains: Imported Rice Trading Is Sluggish</p>
<p>The imported rice market was fluctuating yesterday, rising and falling sharply, often with differences of 0.03-0.05 yuan. However, the result was still similar to the previous market. Because the inventory of imported rice is sufficient, new goods continue to arrive, and digestion is weak, the market price is difficult to raise. However, with the new prices not being set, the owners are unwilling to sell cheaply, and speculators and those in the interior are also taking advantage of the small profits. The market is also not easy to suppress, but actual sales are not smooth, and transactions are finally sluggish. Speculators are beginning to realize that the market is difficult to boost, so they are also dumping, and the market color has entered a weary state. The closing prices showed a depreciation of 0.03-0.05 yuan. No. 1 aged Saigon was 58.03 yuan and 58 yuan, new pointed rice was 56-57 yuan, and No. 2 was 53.50 yuan. The transaction volume of spot rice was also less than 4,500 bags. Trading of original-package Yinghua Sze was not completed.</p>
<p>1,300-1,400 bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice continued to arrive. Market rumors, one being that there was too much stock, and the second being that they were restrained by the imported rice, the news was all weary. The price fell by about 0.5 yuan. Changbang fresh Qing japonica was 67 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica was 65-66 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica was 64-65 yuan, then to about 60 yuan, old thin rice was 62 yuan, Nangang original package early rice was 62-63 yuan, particularly fresh rice was 62 yuan, ordinary rice was 60 yuan, and then to 58 yuan. Glutinous rice Jinli special yuan was 61.50 yuan and 61 yuan, Changzhou white yuan was 60 yuan, Danyang was 58-59 yuan, Hong Kong special yuan was 61 yuan, Zhongguan was 58 yuan, and Yuan was 54 yuan, etc. The source of Zhoupu new japonica was also more abundant than before, with more than 40 loads, but the sales market felt sluggish, so the opening price was weary. Chong special goods were sold at 62 yuan, and Zhongguan was 61 yuan.</p>
<h3>粉麥湧到　月餅訉銷路不旺</h3>
<p>Flour and Wheat Flood In; Mooncake Sales Are Not Strong</p>
<p>The flour market was particularly calm yesterday. Due to transportation difficulties, new transactions are unlikely to develop. Although the retail market is in the midst of the mooncake season, the demand is not comparable to the past. Therefore, although the output of Fuxin and Fufeng factories is small, it is sufficient to meet the needs of this street. The factory price is still 15 yuan. The two factories ship out 3,000-4,000 bags per day. The market is calm. The trading of Japanese flour Phoenix brand is also not much. The September price is 14.75 yuan, and the October price is 14.90 yuan. Because the recovered goods are running out, futures are still tight by about 0.20 yuan. The spot price is not conducive to the environment and lacks transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday it was heard that a new ship of imported flour had arrived, totaling more than 100,000 bags, all of which are the Fortress and Asahi brands. The goods are still being unloaded. It was also heard that a ship of wheat ordered by Fuxin had also been imported. With imported flour and wheat flooding in at the same time, the market may be difficult to improve for a while.</p>
<p>The wheat market continued to be calm. Due to the weekend, arrivals and sales were equally quiet. Japanese factories such as Sanxin and Xiexing were slow to buy, and the sellers also attached great importance to the eating plate, holding on and unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, the transaction volume was only 1,000-2,000 bags. It was heard that imported wheat was being shipped in batches, and the price had secretly loosened by 0.03-0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>油市　生油現貨　於疲跌中得買戶</h3>
<p>Oil Market: Crude Oil Spot Market Finds Buyers Amidst a Weary Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the peanut oil market initially continued the previous day's weakness, with futures continuing to fall by 1 yuan. As a result, more than 3,000 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, with the price for the second half of September being 59 yuan and the price for the first half of October being 60 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao oil were ordered for September delivery, with the price being 88 yuan. The spot oil, under the heavy decline, attracted buyers from the interior, causing speculators to take the opportunity to push up prices. Buying interest turned strong, and the market price immediately rose sharply. A total of more than 1,500 pieces were traded, with prices ranging from 60 yuan to 62 yuan. Soybean oil consequently stabilized, with 50 barrels of Dalian oil being traded at 97 yuan and 100 dan of Dayouyu factory oil being traded at 74 yuan, according to old warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>The amount of oil beans and miscellaneous grains exported today was also not small. 1,105 tins of crude oil were shipped to Xiamen, and another 610 tins were shipped to Hong Kong. There were also 300 pieces of soybean oil and 34 bags of soybeans shipped to Hong Kong, 500 bags of soybeans and 500 pieces of soybean cake shipped to Singapore, 3,500 pieces of soybean cake and 120 bags of wheat shipped to Xiamen, and 40 pieces of soybean cake shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市迂廻前進</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Advances Circuitously</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend reappeared, but actual transactions still showed little progress. However, speculative sentiment was very good. This was because the consolidation had been going on for a long time, and the general amount of absorption was firmly unwilling to give up. Therefore, the chips on the table were tight. The market is advancing circuitously. However, according to the inventory report, the inventory of yarn in various warehouses is increasing daily. As soon as the bulls can make a profit, they sell, and the market changes quickly.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with a very tight atmosphere. Everyone wanted to buy and grab bull positions. As a result, the table felt very weak. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 938 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. After a while, it fell slightly to 934 yuan. At this time, buying interest suddenly increased, and it rose again to 942-943 yuan, hovering for a long time. After the bulls slightly released, it fell back to 937-938 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, the bulls came back to life, tracking and hedging empty positions, and gradually rising to 947 yuan, but after the close, it returned to 941 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,645 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 15 yuan. Today, 255 pieces of yarn were shipped to Siam, 445 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 81 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of yarn purchased by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow traders 2,150, Ningbo 50, Hong Kong 185</p>
<p>Yunnan 140, Wenzhou 20, total 2,645</p>
<h3>棉市仍無特色</h3>
<p>The Cotton Market Still Has No Distinctive Features</p>
<p>The situation with spot cotton is that there was a slightly excited atmosphere in the past, but this newspaper has already learned that there is no hope for large-scale development from all parties. Because the yarn price is not rising, and all parties have sufficient inventory, the cotton market cannot rise sharply, and the future is still not very good. Fellow traders have slightly traded, with White Locke priced at 197 yuan, Fire Machine Flower at 158 yuan, and Houston at 208 yuan. The market price remains stagnant, with no distinctive features and a downward trend.</p>
<h3>疋頭　國布前途　仍看稪航能否實現　東疋棉紗已見活動</h3>
<p>Piece Goods: The Future of Domestic Cloth Still Depends on Whether Navigation Can Be Restored; Eastern Piece Cotton Yarn Has Seen Activity</p>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market showed a glimmer of hope with the resumption of navigation between Zhejiang and Fujian. Cotton yarn in eastern pieces reported an increase in price, and the market trend slightly turned lively. The northern gang and Nanyang gang in this street had a slightly stronger intention to buy, and the market plate was firm. The asking price increased by 0.025 yuan per piece, but the actual transaction price was mostly the original plate from the previous day. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. The Northern Route Yanjin gang transacted more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, twill money cloth, etc. The Nanyang gang transacted more than 8,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed cloth, and twill. Because whether the navigation line in Zhejiang and Fujian can be smoothly operated is still in question, most people are unwilling to take risks and are watching and waiting.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The fellow traders and speculators in this street are bullish and have a strong desire to buy. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 31.03 yuan, rose to 31.06 yuan, and closed. The market atmosphere continued to tighten in the afternoon, rising gradually. At the close, it was 31.085 yuan. Four Gentlemen Biji rose to 0.09275 yuan per yard. Mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloth and fine twill also increased by 0.025-0.05 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, 12 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 697 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 197 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>國產防雨布暢銷</h3>
<p>Domestically Produced Rainproof Cloth Sells Well</p>
<p>The rainproof cloth produced by the domestic Yousheng Factory has recently been selling quite well, especially with Western clothing stores and raincoat makers in the Daxin Street area making very large purchases. This is because Western rainwear cloth is expensive, and Eastern goods are in extremely short supply. Only China Icy Company and the Shanghai Raincoat Fabric Factory have a slight output of domestic goods, but because they do not sell materials and only sell ready-made raincoats, they have not been popularized, which has created a good opportunity for the Yousheng Factory's rainproof cloth to sell well. Yesterday it was heard that Rentaihao in Juyuanfang, Fujian Road, opened and purchased more than 10,000 yards, with the transaction price being 3.09 yuan. Light and dark beige, cyan-gray, and navy blue were all the same. Most of the Chinese clothing shops sell navy blue, while Western raincoat shops mostly use beige.</p>
<h3>糖市　下檔車白回好</h3>
<p>Sugar Market: Lower-Grade Refined White Sugar Recovers</p>
<p>The sugar market trend was stable yesterday, with little fluctuations. The association set the price for spot goods at 73.08 yuan per ton for first-grade coarse white sugar from local warehouses, up 0.03 yuan, 73 yuan for goods arriving on April 7, 73.50 yuan for new goods from foreign warehouses, 58.02 yuan for re-export goods, and 58.50 yuan for goods arriving on August 15. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark remained at 74 yuan, DY mark was 69.45 yuan, up 0.5 yuan, HX mark was 69.34 yuan, up 7.89 yuan, Dutch red mark was 61 yuan, 61.50 yuan for goods arriving on September 6, and then tightened to 63 yuan, but no deal was made. According to the Dutch telegraph, it was 10.50. The rest of the local refined white sugar and first-grade ice sugar had little fluctuation, and domestic sugar was not yet available.</p>
<h3>南北貨　槐米獻新</h3>
<p>North and South Goods: Locust Flower Rice Offers New</p>
<p>Locust flower rice has been sluggish for a long time due to the slow sales and dull market. Yesterday it was heard that more than ten new pieces of goods had been transported to the number shops, and the goods were in good condition and color. However, because the market is sluggish, it is feared that it will be difficult to sell well.</p>
<h3>五金　盤元銷路奇呆</h3>
<p>Hardware: Wire Rod Sales Are Strangely Stagnant</p>
<p>The new wire rod market has recently been fluctuating due to the sudden changes in foreign exchange, so the market price has also been rising and falling. It was found that the price of Japanese nails fell the day before yesterday, but the foreign exchange did not show any relaxation, so the standard remains firm. It was found that the price of Japanese nails was 45 yuan per case, but the asking price for wire rod was 47-48 yuan per load, so most of the nail manufacturers stopped or reduced production after seeing this situation. On the contrary, they saw the strangely stagnant sales of the produced goods (Japanese nails), so the people in this industry became more and more tired, and the market atmosphere was also decaying. To save this decline, it is necessary to sell the wire nails produced by the factories in this street overseas. However, the recent closure of the sea ports has caused both domestic and southern sales to be cut off, so it is difficult to improve the trend for a while. The sales of new wire rod will also suffer a major setback.</p>
<h3>煤炭　開平塊挺俏</h3>
<p>Coal: Kailan Lump Coal Is Rising and Attractive</p>
<p>Kailan lump coal has been in short supply for a long time, and the supply has not been abundant. Sales are even stronger. The streets, knowing that it is difficult to receive goods, have to follow the market and take it. The market has continued to rise. Kailan No. 1 mixed coal is 170 yuan per ton, screened lump coal is 190 yuan, No. 1 and 2 mixed coal is 155 yuan, and lump coal is 175 yuan. The above are the discounted prices for fellow traders, and customers are charged a small amount for delivery.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials　Armadillo Scales Rise Ten Dollars</h3>
<p>Armadillo scales have recently been in short supply and arrivals are infrequent, while demand remains active. As a result, market prices have continued to rise. The current market price is 210 yuan, which is about 10 yuan higher than in the early part of this month. The future market may continue to be tight, depending on how the demand for stomach ailments shifts.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Defense Areas Left by British Troops Has Not Yet Reached a Resolution Stage, Officials Continue to Remain Silent on This Matter, No Definite Date Yet for Japanese Troops to Take Over the Western District</h3>
<p>Yesterday, business circles in Shanghai once again expressed deep concern regarding which party would permanently take over the defense of the "Ding" and "Yi" districts after the withdrawal of American troops. It has been a week since the compromise solution was proposed, but the Japanese side has not yet moved into the Western District of Shanghai. According to general opinion, this is sufficient to prove that the Japanese side is not yet satisfied with the International Settlement Volunteer Corps taking over from the British troops. It is understood that the Japanese side is unwilling to take over the Western District because they do not want the people of Shanghai to believe that the Japanese side has at least partially agreed to the decision made by the Defense Committee. This is because they have consistently insisted that all British troop defense areas should be taken over by the Japanese troops. Yesterday morning, officials continued to remain silent on this issue, even remaining tight-lipped about whether Washington and Tokyo are still negotiating the issue of "who will take over from the British troops."</p>
<p>British Cavalry Deployed Last Night</p>
<p>Since the International Settlement Volunteer Corps' armored car unit was issued rifles by the Settlement authorities the night before, it has moved to the Western District of Hongkou to take over the defense duties of some vacationing members of the A-Character Battalion. Furthermore, the Volunteer Corps Commander, Hemphill, also summoned the light cavalry unit of the cavalry regiment yesterday afternoon to deploy at 7 PM last night. This light cavalry unit is also a British contingent, and its new task, like the previously summoned armored car unit, is to remedy the inadequacy of the A-Character Battalion's forces and thereby strengthen the defense of the area. The quota for this light cavalry unit is 110 men, but the actual number is currently around 70 men.</p>
<p>Remarks Made by Japanese Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a Japanese naval spokesperson, at a press reception last night (23rd), could not issue a definitive statement regarding the new method for redefining the foreign military defense areas in Shanghai. It is reported that, to his knowledge, the Japanese naval landing force has not yet specified a definite date for dispatching troops to take over the "Ding" defense area in the Western District of Shanghai. When a reporter asked whether the establishment of the new police force in the Western District would be changed if the Japanese troops were assigned to take over the "Ding" defense area, the spokesperson replied that these were two separate issues. The issue of the new police force has not yet reached the final stage. The spokesperson also stated that, in his opinion, the Japanese troops might not enter and garrison the "Ding" defense area until the outstanding issue of the "Yi" defense area is resolved through negotiations. However, he expects that the defense area issue will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Increased Scrutiny of Automobile Licenses</p>
<p>The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that several "municipal police" have been meticulously inspecting the licenses of passing automobiles and various vehicles at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Di Feng Road in recent days. It is said that the "municipal police" in the area have been intensifying the inspection of vehicle licenses for two days, so almost all automobiles have been inspected. Many believe that this move is a harbinger that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" will begin to force all vehicles to obtain licenses next month.</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That the Japanese Side Intends to Draft a New Plan</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a rumor circulating that the Japanese authorities in the city are currently drafting a new plan regarding the jurisdiction of roads outside the settlement in the Western District. Both the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" remain silent. However, government officials hint that the Shanghai Municipal Council will certainly not permit any changes to the Western District Agreement concluded in February.</p>
<h3>The Germans Recruit Chinese Laborers in France and Raise Wages</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, more than a thousand Chinese living in France have returned to their home country one after another. This is because, after the war, France imposed very strict restrictions on all work and activities of foreign residents, whether in industry, commerce, or as students. After the German troops occupied Paris, they exercised even more direct control, prohibiting vendors from setting up stalls on the streets, which made it impossible for foreign residents to maintain their livelihoods. As a result, the number of unemployed people increased dramatically, reaching tens of thousands. In order to facilitate the war against Britain and expedite the production of military supplies, the Germans are vigorously recruiting Chinese from all over France. Their wages have also increased from five francs to twenty francs per hour.</p>
<h3>The British London Banknote Ban Has Little Impact on Trade, Normal Trade Transactions Are Mostly in Drafts, the Real Purpose Is to Eliminate the British Banknote Market and Prevent Germany from Remitting British Banknotes to Neutral Countries</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the British government has issued a plan to prohibit the import of Bank of England banknotes into Britain. Many merchants are asking whether the free British gold on the Shanghai market will disappear after the British government takes this action. It should be known that this new regulation only applies to banknotes, and the method of payment by banknotes has never occupied any important position in international trade, because the main medium of exchange in international trade</p>
<p>is drafts.</p>
<p>However, under special circumstances, once a transaction involves expensive insurance fees, especially under the current war conditions, there is indeed the practice of remitting banknotes to London to settle the outstanding accounts. According to a representative of a certain British bank, as far as he can remember, the bank has never used banknotes for remittance in the past five years. Therefore, the impact of the British government's new plan</p>
<p>is only that Shanghai will no longer have a market for British banknotes from August 28th. However, other payment methods, such as drafts, checks, and letters of credit, will continue to be traded. Due to the shrinking free British gold market, drafts and the like will not be traded on a large scale. However, this matter has nothing to do with the aforementioned steps taken by the British government. As the current situation reveals, the British government is determined to</p>
<p>prevent the German side</p>
<p>from having the opportunity to remit British pound banknotes from occupied areas to neutral countries, and for British bank agencies in neutral countries to accept them. New York and Shanghai still have a demand for free British gold, because the avenues for using free gold pounds have not been completely closed. Japan is still able to settle outstanding accounts with some British gold group countries, such as India, so Japanese banks are purchasing British gold on the Shanghai exchange market. However, the intention of the British authorities is to eliminate the free British gold market as soon as possible and base all transactions on the official exchange rate.</p>

<p>The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reports that Mr. White, the economic editor of the Malay Straits Times, is passing through Shanghai on his way back to Singapore from the United States. According to his discussion, the United States is quite concerned about the activities of the German Fifth Column, and manufacturers are admittedly uneasy about the secret sabotage of the Fifth Column. When he was in the United States, only one</p>
<p>airplane factory</p>
<p>had already experienced three instances of secret sabotage. Today, the members of the Fifth Column in the United States no longer attempt to curry favor with public opinion, and their main purpose is to obstruct industrial production, especially to hinder the production of airplanes, and are proceeding with the greatest vigor. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands, American public opinion seems to be more supportive of the Allied countries, so the majority of the American public now supports actively assisting the Allied countries, except for participating in the war. He believes that the United States will not participate in the war. Mr. White also said that,</p>
<p>when he passed through Japan</p>
<p>on this trip, he received treatment that was extremely unfriendly, which he had never encountered before in other places. The recent arrest of British residents in Japan may be because some of the arrested British people were known to be pro-Japanese. Mr. White feels that Japan has reached a point where it is financially strapped, and a shortage of money cannot be supported indefinitely by force. He believes that Japan's southward advance will not be launched at present and will be decided based on the outcome of the European war. Furthermore, the question of whether Japan</p>
<p>can maintain</p>
<p>the territory it has occupied in China is quite problematic. He personally believes that Japan cannot maintain it, because the Chinese side has always planned to recover the lost territory. Mr. White concluded by saying that half of Singapore's population is Chinese, who strongly support China. Looking at the entire Malay Archipelago, the population is five million, and there are many Chinese. According to Mr. White, this is his first visit to China and Japan, and he is scheduled to leave Shanghai on Sunday to return to Singapore.</p>
<h3>High Tide Abated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The high tide in the Huangpu River has receded to below ten feet since yesterday, so it is gradually abating.

<h3>Implementation of Restrictions on Rice Exports</h3>
<p>Previously, suggestions were made to suppress the current rice prices, firstly by improving the sources of rice both domestically and internationally, increasing rice reserves, and cracking down on illegal transactions; and secondly by preventing rice already transported to Shanghai from being re-exported to other areas, thereby increasing local reserves. The rice industry and the authorities of the two concessions had attached considerable importance to these suggestions. Now, the Public Works Department has issued a notice restricting the transportation of rice outside the concession areas, requiring prior acquisition of permits. It is also reported that the rice industry has received instructions from the authorities to implement these measures.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle on Nanjing Road Allegedly Attacked with Stones</h3>
<p>However, the Public Works Department has not reported that around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, it was rumored that two Japanese military officers in uniform were riding in a car when someone suddenly threw stones at them in front of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, injuring the forehead of one officer.

<h3>Sheng Sheng Ranch Manager Shen Jiucheng Abducted Yesterday - Bandits Ambushed and Drove Away in His Car - Rescue Efforts Outside the Concession Were Ineffective</h3>
<p>An abduction occurred at the entrance of Youyi Village on Columbia Road in Shanghai at approximately 10:15 AM yesterday. The victim was Shen Jiucheng, the manager of the local Sheng Sheng Ranch. The kidnappers, numbering four, brandished firearms, forcing Shen's driver out of the car. The bandits jumped in and one of them drove off towards Anhua Temple Road, Hongqiao Road, and Lujia Road. The details of the abduction, as learned, are as follows:</p>
<p>Heading to the Factory for Business</p>
<p>Shen Jiucheng, 47 years old, a native of Cixi, Zhejiang, has resided at No. 9 Columbia Road in Shanghai for many years. He currently serves as the manager of Sheng Sheng Ranch at No. 174 Daxilu. Before the war, Shen was known for his skillful management and dedicated efforts, making the business very prosperous. He also established a branch at No. 200, Lane 541, Anhua Temple Road. At approximately 10:15 AM yesterday, Shen was riding in his own Ford car, license plate number 3735, driven by his Ningbo driver, Ying Zhonghui (who has been working for him for seven or eight years), heading towards the Anhua Temple Road branch for inspection.</p>
<p>Abducted En Route</p>
<p>When the car had not gone far, reaching the entrance of Youyi Village on the same road, a car suddenly blocked the road. The kidnappers, who had been lying in wait, shouted Shen's name. Seeing Shen's car approaching, two of the bandits immediately pulled out handguns, blocking the way. They first forced Shen's driver, Ying Zhonghui, out of the car. Ying, intimidated by their violence, had no choice but to obey. The bandits then jumped into the car, and one of them, acting as the driver, drove the car towards Anhua Temple Road, Hongqiao Road, and Lujia Road.</p>
<p>Unable to Pursue</p>
<p>After the incident, the driver, Ying Zhonghui, ran back home and reported to Shen's family. Shen's residence immediately pressed the police alarm. Upon hearing the alarm, the Jing'an Temple Road police station quickly dispatched a red patrol car to the scene to pursue the kidnappers. When they reached the vicinity of the barbed wire on Hongqiao Road, they vaguely saw what appeared to be Shen's car speeding away. However, because the area belonged to the occupied zone and there was a foreign military guard post nearby, it was inconvenient to cross the border to pursue them. They immediately returned to Shen's residence, brought the driver, Ying Zhonghui, back to the police station to question him about the abduction of his employer, in order to track down the kidnappers and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Outward Strength, Inward Weakness</p>
<p>The reporter met with Mr. Ju of the ranch, who stated that the ranch had been established for over ten years and had a modest scale. Before the war, branches had been opened in Longhua, Xietu Road, Caohejing, and other places. A branch was also established in Zhuanqiao, on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, specializing in raising dairy cows. However, after August 13th, the above-mentioned areas became occupied zones. The ranch buildings were razed to the ground, and the ranch was almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. The losses suffered were incalculable. In addition, with the recent soaring prices and a slight increase in milk prices, sales have become sluggish, and the business has been greatly affected. The company's situation has become one of outward strength but inward weakness.</p>
<h3>Harana and Golden Set Sail Last Night to Explore Zhejiang Eastern Shipping Routes - Harana Sails to Gu'ao, Golden Sails to Songmen and Ganpu</h3>
<p>The German Far East Company's Harana ship, continuing its trial voyage to Gu'ao Head, set sail last night at dusk. The Golden ship, also exploring Zhejiang eastern shipping routes, set sail from the Bund No. 4 wharf at 6:00 PM yesterday. The destination is Songmen, Ganpu, and nearby islands. Where the passengers will disembark will be determined after observing the situation in eastern Zhejiang. There is no confirmation yet whether the Moufu ship will also attempt to explore the routes.</p>
<p>Fujian Merchants Oppose Freight Rate Increase</p>
<p>Dozens of Fujian merchants in Shanghai, including Huang Fengji (representing the Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou merchant guilds), opposed the doubling of the freight rate for the Fusheng Company's Xin'anna ship on its trial voyage to Fuqing. They convened a joint meeting at the Fujian Fellow Association yesterday. They resolved: "The shipping rates between Shanghai and Fujian have been increased several times by various companies, and we have reluctantly accepted them. The current doubling is unbearable. Moreover, with each ship's original return to Shanghai, the losses to Fujian merchants have been enormous. Therefore, we will not accept this further increase in freight rates and will announce to all Fujian merchants that those who ship goods to Fujian on this ship must calculate according to the original freight rates, otherwise the association will impose penalties." According to the Pingming News Agency's inquiry to the Fusheng Company, the doubling of the freight rate is imperative and unlikely to change.</p>
<h3>The Path of Three Hurricanes</h3>
<p>According to the Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, regarding the three consecutive hurricanes in the Pacific, the first hurricane, after making landfall west of Hong Kong and heading towards western Guangdong, has dissipated.

There was no report on the path of the third hurricane as of 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Release of Fresh Eggs Shipped to Shanghai by Haening Foreign Firm</h3>
<p>Regarding the ban on egg transport, the Shanghai office of the American firm Haening received a telegram from the American Consul General's office, which in turn had received a telegram from the Chongqing Embassy. The Ministry of Finance had sent a special telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding this matter. The Chongqing telegram stated: "The Ministry of Finance's previous telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the ban on egg exports did not include fresh eggs. The Ministry of Finance has now sent a special telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government clarifying the situation and ordering the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allow the normal release of fresh eggs shipped to Shanghai by the American firm Haening from Ningbo."</p>

<h3>Designation of Native Goods Exempt from Transit Tax - Objections to Valuation Permitted - Tax-Exempt Goods Include Forty-Four Categories Such as Fresh Eggs</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Customs Transit Tax, all goods manufactured or structured in the country from dutiable foreign raw materials, or foreign goods that have been adulterated or diluted after import, or whose original state has been altered by other means, shall be regarded as native goods and subject to transit tax upon transshipment. All manufactured goods sold domestically are entitled to the same treatment as ordinary native goods, i.e., manufactured goods transported to various parts of the country are subject to transit tax in the same way as similar ordinary native goods. These goods should also be subject to customs duty once, except for goods subject to consolidated tax. Now, in order to relieve the burden on merchants, the National Government has stipulated that forty-four categories of goods, such as fresh eggs, shall be exempt from transit tax. Other goods shall be subject to transit tax at a rate of several percent either ad valorem or per hundred.</p>
<p>Tax-Exempt Goods</p>
<p>Fresh eggs, honey, bones, shells, oyster shells, unnamed animal products, unnamed fish and seafood products, bran, buckwheat, unnamed miscellaneous grain flour, sorghum, corn, millet, rice, seed cakes, wheat, unnamed miscellaneous grains, unnamed vegetable dyes, fresh olives, bridges, unnamed fruits, garlic, large mustard, salted dried radish, unnamed dried and fresh bran vegetables, feed, unnamed plant products, unnamed bamboo products, charcoal, firewood, unnamed rattan products, waste cotton, waste silk, unnamed textile fibers, ropes and nets, drawnwork, drawnwork, embroidered products, lace ornaments, unnamed textiles, bricks and tiles, earthenware pottery, unnamed clay sand and stone and their products, unnamed chemicals and chemical products, unnamed printed matter, straw hats, whips, and straw hats, hair nets, hairpieces, straw mats, reed mats.</p>
<p>Objections Allowed</p>
<p>If an exporter is dissatisfied with the price or classification determined by the customs, he may lodge a written protest with the Commissioner of Customs within fourteen days from the date of issuance of the transit tax payment certificate, clearly stating the reasons for the objection. Pending resolution of the case, the merchant may submit a deposit and request that the goods be released first. The amount of the deposit must be sufficient to pay the full amount of tax due and other additional charges determined by the customs, but this procedure is limited to those approved by the customs. Within fifteen days of receiving the protest, the Commissioner of Customs shall review the case. If he still considers the merchant's protest to be invalid, he shall submit the case to the Director-General of Customs for verification. If the Director-General of Customs deems the handling of the case to be appropriate, he shall forward it to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee for final determination.</p>
<p>Tax Evasion and False Reporting</p>
<p>When the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee meets, all questions concerning procedures, etc., shall be decided by a majority vote. These resolutions shall be implemented after being approved by the Directorate General of Customs. Regarding disputes over the price of goods, if the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee determines that the actual price of the goods exceeds the price originally reported by the protester by 20% or more, the Customs may, in addition to collecting the correct tax due, order the protester to pay a penalty of ten times or less the amount of tax evaded. For goods whose prices are in dispute and have already been sold under contract, if the contract was not submitted for verification at the time of declaration, the contract will not be recognized as evidence of the price of the goods if it is later submitted to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee, and the protest will be considered invalid.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Disturb Xikou Again, Dropping Twenty-Four Bombs - Over One Hundred Houses Destroyed, Only One Death - Also Invading Ningbo and Strafing with Machine Guns</h3>
<p>Four Japanese planes, taking off from the skies above Guanhaizi at 7:44 AM the previous morning, intruded into Ningbo for low-altitude reconnaissance and dropped many absurd leaflets. They then used machine guns to strafe, resulting in a civilian, He Shunli, from Baiheqiao in Jiangdong, being shot in the waist and falling to the ground injured. He was immediately rushed to the hospital by the air defense rescue team, and his life is expected to be saved.</p>
<p>Sneaking into Xikou</p>
<p>The group of Japanese planes then sneaked into Fenghua Xikou, dropping fifteen bombs, including incendiary bombs, causing fires in many places. After the Japanese planes wreaked havoc, they headed out to sea towards Longshan. At 12:30 PM, two more Japanese planes intruded into the skies over Xikou from Guanhaizi and dropped nine more bombs. They only left along their original route after 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Bombing Locations</p>

<h3>Daylight Robbery on Xinzha Road - Detectives Open Fire to Capture Robbers - One Robber Wounded, One Captured Alive - Three Lookouts Escape</h3>
<p>The home of Fu Zhongshan, resident of No. 8 Renji Lane, Xinzha Road, was suddenly visited by five well-dressed robbers in Western suits at approximately 1:30 PM yesterday. Two of them carried handguns and entered the house to rob, while the other three stood guard at the entrance and in the lane. After the two robbers entered the house, they drove the homeowner's family and servants into a corner, then ransacked the boxes and cabinets, stealing cash and jewelry worth approximately one thousand several hundred yuan, which they put into bags.</p>
<p>Just About to Escape</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a resident of a neighboring house noticed that Fu's house had been robbed and secretly called the Xinzha Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Chinese detective Yang Yunfeng along with several Chinese and Western detectives, driving a patrol car to arrest the robbers. The three robbers who were standing guard in the lane saw the armed detectives arriving and knew that something was wrong, so they quietly escaped. When</p>
<p>The Detectives Swarmed In</p>
<p>The two robbers inside the house also turned around and attempted to escape upstairs. The detectives drew their guns and ordered them to stop from behind. One of the robbers dropped his handgun and surrendered. The other robber climbed onto the wall of a neighboring house from the roof, intending to jump down. The detectives fired a shot, wounding the robber in the leg, and were able to capture him. They also found all the stolen goods near the two robbers, then summoned an ambulance to take the wounded robber to the police hospital for treatment. Because</p>
<p>The Injuries Were Severe</p>
<p>He was unable to speak, so it was impossible to interrogate him. The other captured robber was tall and sturdy, and dressed in fashionable Western clothing. After being taken back to the police station for questioning, he identified himself as Gao Shunfa, also known as Guo Shunfa, and admitted to conspiring with the gang to commit armed robbery. He is currently detained at the police station, awaiting transfer to the court for prosecution.</p>

One part of the team guarded the entrances and exits, and another part broke into the house. At that time, those in the residence were engrossed in gambling. This unexpected intrusion startled everyone. Forty-nine gamblers (including seven women) and Mori Tsumori, a Japanese man who was the "Supervisor of the Shanghai Rickshaw Association" on Dongjiaxing Road, were arrested on the spot, and all gambling funds of over 4,000 yuan on the table were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Youth - Commits Suicide Out of Shame and Anger</h3>
<p>Zhu Shende, a Ningbo native residing at No. 11, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, is 26 years old and unmarried. He has been unemployed for five or six years. He relies on his elderly father, Zhu Zihui (64 years old), who works as a merchant outside, for financial support. Recently, due to the high cost of living, his father's monthly income was not enough to cover household expenses, causing financial difficulties. His father scolded him for not finding a way to make a living outside and for sitting at home doing nothing. As a result, father and son had an argument. Shende felt ashamed that he could not run a business to support his elderly father, but instead relied on his father to work hard outside to make a living. After thinking it over, he suddenly had a suicidal thought. At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, while his father was out, he swallowed poisonous liquid to commit suicide. When his father returned home at night and discovered what had happened, he reported it to the police and sent him to Guangci Hospital. However, the poison had already taken effect, and he died at 3:00 AM that night despite treatment.</p>
<h3>Enticing Women From Good Families - Forcing Them Into Prostitution - Three Female Victims Rescued - Procuress Chen Liu Arrested for Investigation</h3>
<p>Chen Liu, a Yangzhou woman residing at No. 8, Lane 51, Guling Road, specialized in enticing women from good families and forcing them into prostitution. Recently, Li Cuiying (father named Wang Jinmei, 19 years old), a Changshu girl raised by Chen, could not bear the abuse and secretly informed the detective department of the Zhabei Police Station. Western detective Fang Tewahua (badge number 31013) went to the address, arrested Chen, and rescued Li Cuiying and another 18-year-old Yangzhou woman, Li Guiying (also known as Chen Guiying or Li Xiuzhen). Later, they went to No. 9 Avenue Haig, French Concession, and rescued Wu A'mei (also known as Sun Lingdi), a 14-year-old girl from Danyang. They also seized six contracts of sale, which clearly proved that Chen Liu was in the business of enticing women from good families and forcing them into prostitution as a regular occupation. She was handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted her according to Article 231, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, she was ordered to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Divorced Woman Accuses Ex-Husband of Joint Embezzlement - Hu Jinli Absconds with the Money</h3>
<p>Xu Fulong, 37 years old, a native of Yancheng, residing at No. 47 Baixiang Village, Rue de la Mission, is the owner of the Pingjin Sanhelou restaurant opposite the Great World on Min'ti'ni Road. In 1926, he married Xu Jiang (38 years old, nicknamed "Thirteen O'Clock", also known as "Crazy Three"), a woman from Yangzhou. The relationship was relatively harmonious after the marriage, but they did not have any children. In recent years, Jiang's attitude suddenly changed. She frequently visited entertainment venues, and met Xu Haishan (42 years old), a truck driver from Yancheng, at the Great World. She then rented a house and lived with him at No. 462, Route des Soeurs. It was not until January 27th of this year that Xu Fulong found out about it. He reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Xu Jiang and Xu Haishan, and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Judge Wu Kechou sentenced each of them to four months' imprisonment. Xu Fulong also filed a divorce suit against Jiang in the Civil Court of the same court. Judge Yu Changzi presided over the seventh civil court to mediate a settlement. A settlement was reached in court, with Xu Fulong paying a separation fee of 800 yuan. Jiang designated her nephew-in-law, Hu Jinli, to collect the money on her behalf. A written agreement was made on March 16th, with Hu collecting the 800 yuan. However, after receiving the money, Hu did not hand it over to Jiang, but fled to Hongkou. Recently, Jiang hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special District Court, accusing Xu Fulong and Hu Jinli of colluding to embezzle the money, violating Article 335 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Tang Jia-hua presided over the second criminal court to hear the case yesterday morning. Xu Fulong commissioned lawyer Xu Wufang to appear in court to defend him, claiming that after the civil court settlement, the plaintiff instructed to hand the money to Hu, and the money and receipt were exchanged on March 16th, so it was actually unrelated to the defendant and Hu Jinli should be pursued separately. Hu Jinli did not appear despite being summoned by the court. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and Hu Jinli's address was unknown, so a public notice was served.</p>

<h3>A Grand Spectacle of Tennis Exhibition; Extremely Exciting Match; Carson and Little Hsu Lost in Doubles, Lin and Wang Take the Lead; British Consul-General George Attends and Delivers a Thank You Speech</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club hosted a performance by Chinese and Western tennis masters yesterday afternoon at 4:30 in front of the grandstand at the Race Course to raise funds for the British War Relief Fund. The performance was extremely exciting, and the audience was unprecedentedly large, with two to three thousand Chinese and Westerners in attendance. In the middle of the match, the British Westforth Military Band played famous songs, which was also a farewell performance for the band. Finally, British Consul-General George gave a speech, thanking all parties. It was a pity that the match could not be completed due to a sudden autumn rain. The performance was the most exciting seen in Shanghai recently. Carson flew back from Japan to participate. Hsu Cheng-wei's backhand shot in the first singles match was quite skillful, hitting the mark repeatedly, but his net play and stamina were not as good as Carson's. The two young boys, Li and Liang, in the second doubles match showed remarkable progress. They came back from 2-4 to win 7-5. Stokes made many mistakes. The final doubles match was the highlight, with Wang Wenzheng and Lin directly defeating Qiu Feihai of that year. They took an extremely advantageous lead in the first set with 4-1, and then won 6-2 very easily. They won three consecutive games in the third set before the heavy rain stopped the match. Based on Lin and Wang's performance yesterday, they are likely to win the Robber Cup.

<h3>This City Orders the Academic Calendar for Primary and Secondary Schools in the 29th Year of the Republic (1)</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The annual academic calendar for primary and secondary schools in this city was originally announced and implemented by the Municipal Social Bureau. After the westward movement of the Chinese army and the retreat of the government, each school formulated its own academic calendar, resulting in a lack of uniformity across the city, which is a major regret.

In order to seek the unity of school administration, the Shanghai Municipal Extraordinary Period 29th Year Secondary School Academic Calendar and the Shanghai Municipal Extraordinary Period 29th Year Elementary School Academic Calendar have been formulated and will be announced and implemented immediately. In consideration of the environment, some commemorative days will not be held with ceremonies, but only with silent mourning.

<h3>Returning from Gambling, Tasting the Flavor of Detention, More Than Seventy People Detained Overnight, The Public Rental Office Intensifies Enforcement of Curfew</h3>
<p>According to the English Greater America Evening News, between 12:30 am and 5:00 am yesterday, more than 70 Chinese, including 7 women, were detained at the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room for violating the curfew. In addition, 16 cars, some of which were private cars, were also detained at the Patrol Room for violating the curfew. They were only released at 7:00 am yesterday. Most of the detained Chinese were caught entering the Public Concession from various gambling houses in West Shanghai in chartered cars. It is believed that the Public Concession Police Department, in view of the British army's withdrawal from West Shanghai, has intensified the strict enforcement of the curfew in that area during this period. It is reported that the reason why the Police Department has taken this strict measure is to eliminate the intrusion of gambling crimes in the western district into the Public Concession.</p>

<h3>The Growth of American Literature and Art</h3>
<p>In this year, where is there still a paradise? It is either a series of wars or frequent disasters. The Americans, uniquely blessed by nature, rely on the three major elements of favorable weather, geography, and human harmony, and still live a life of good weather, prosperity, and peace. Under the extremely democratic spirit, various forms of literature and art are nurtured and grown without end, creating a new garden of American culture.</p>
<p>What deserves to be called literature and art? National history, social customs, and the real environment, all these reasons cannot be ignored. The Americans, however, honestly use the extremely realistic life and the extremely democratic spirit to set their literary and artistic standards. Their literature and art is alive, dynamic, universal, popular, and under the current situation, it is progressing very quickly. Now, let's not discuss the standards of American literature and art, but only describe the recent development situation as follows:</p>
<p>Radio broadcasting music is all the rage. The symphony orchestras conducted by the famous musician Toscanini every week have as many as 4.5 million listeners. Walter Dan Roshi broadcasts music on NBC radio, and the number of listeners every week is as high as several million. If it were not for the popularity of radio broadcasting, where would there be such a wide audience to appreciate this kind of noble music? The popularization of this kind of music has only been in the past fifteen years. As for schools, there are already more than 35,000 music teams.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of reading books, newspapers and magazines is now far better than before. The works of writers have improved in terms of ideas, materials and writing style. Fifty years ago, the sales volume of any magazine in the United States never exceeded one million copies. Now there are 26 kinds of magazines with sales volumes exceeding one million copies. Famous magazines have a strong literary flavor, but they can have such a large number of readers. This cannot but be said to be the progress of American readers.</p>
<p>Let's look at art again. Famous magazines like Life have begun to use color to exquisitely print ancient and modern famous paintings. Secondly, the famous painting collection A Treasury of Art Masterpieces is priced at ten US dollars, and its sales volume still surpasses other books. The reproduced masterpieces for home decoration are also in short supply. People are flocking to museums and art galleries to study fine arts. The Picasso exhibition held in the New York Museum of Modern Art attracted nearly 100,000 visitors in 50 days. The Italian painting exhibition attracted more than 277,000 visitors in 73 days, which are all amazing records.</p>
<p>The number of people studying in society has increased tenfold compared to 1900. Millions of Americans hope that their children will receive higher education. Enthusiasts who sponsor education and scientific research donate millions of dollars to raise teaching standards. Now, diligent students and young people with scientific talent can get considerable assistance and develop their strengths. The government and the public are also more eager to help artists than before.</p>
<p>The so-called eighth art, the film industry, after a long time of avoiding substantive descriptions, now also has signs of progress, and films based on research and facts are attracting attention. Disney's cartoons are especially unprecedented.</p>
<p>The public's enthusiasm for photography is also a sign of their love for art. Hundreds of thousands of men and women, young and old, can be seen everywhere taking pictures with cameras. After the film is taken, it is developed in the darkroom at home, which fully demonstrates the spirit of amateurs.</p>
<p>If you drive out in a car, you can see engineers and architects working together to plan and create beautiful buildings in the suburbs, and new-style houses of the 20th century stand tall on both sides of the road. New-style bridges and water gates are both practical and beautiful. Just look at the Washington Bridge and the Texaco gas depot. How majestic and moving they are. These are the masterpieces of American unique talent.</p>
<p>In the New York World's Fair, the rainbow-like colored electric light is also a great spectacle in optics and electrical engineering. This is the beginning of the art of light, and there will be more advanced works in the future.</p>
<p>The application of color is now greatly improved. The kitchens in homes, even the machines in factories, and the glassware bought in department stores seem to be made for pleasing the eye, and they are arranged that way. The appearance and packaging of things purchased from stores have also been greatly changed from before, with beauty and convenience as the main goals. Gradually, everyone knows that daily necessities can be beautified, and many people love to use beautiful things.</p>

<h3>Quezon, the First President of the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Shou Shan</p>
<p>Quezon, the first president of the Philippines, is full of rubber-like elasticity and lightning-like alertness, and can be regarded as a "veteran" among the world's dictators. He is short in stature, fashionable in dress, wears his hat tilted to the most fashionable angle, and loves pleasure no less than power. He is a very shrewd poker gambler and also a dance expert.</p>
<p>But he is by no means just a playboy, but one of the most shrewd politicians in the world. He is as enthusiastic about patriotism as he is about self-love. The history of the Philippines in the 20th century is inseparable from Quezon's biography.</p>
<p>He was born in a small town on Luzon Island and is now 62 years old. His father was a school principal. His half-Spanish mother was a teacher. When he was young, he was smart but lazy. He went to university to study law, but dropped out in 1898 when the Philippine Revolution broke out against Spanish rule.</p>
<p>Most of the 14 million Filipinos love comfort, but in order to resist the oppression of the Spanish, they unanimously launched a great revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the patriotic leader Aguinaldo. At this time, the United States also declared war on Spain, and the revolutionary army won victories. After the United States defeated Spain, it took over the Philippine Islands, and Aguinaldo resisted the United States until he was captured by the US military in 1901.</p>
<p>Quezon then continued to resist the American army, and his anger at the failure of the resistance can be imagined. Therefore, he refused to learn English for many years. Later, he worked as a lawyer in a province of the Philippines, earning about 500 US dollars a month, but he soon gave it up and changed to a prosecutor for 75 yuan a month. He dared to accuse a famous American lawyer of fraud, and thus became famous throughout the country. Before 1904, the Philippines had never heard of a Filipino accusing an American. In 1908, when he was 30 years old, he became a leader of the Philippine Assembly and the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>In the next 25 years, he continued to engage in the independence movement. He served as the Philippine representative in Washington for eight years, and after returning to China, he was elected Speaker of the Philippine Senate. In 1934, the US Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act, and the Philippines became an autonomous republic, and it was stipulated that it would be completely independent by 1946. Quezon was elected as the first president.</p>
<p>Although he is over 60 years old, he still works tirelessly every day. He usually gets up at dawn and likes to receive guests at breakfast. He meets guests very informally, often wearing a sports shirt and opening his collar.</p>
<p>During the week, he would make two or three unexpected inspections of the police station, prison, tobacco factory, or any department of the government. He likes to listen to people complaining, and sometimes he even eats with the workers. If a political prisoner is arrested, he often talks to him in person.</p>
<p>He likes to do things quickly. He decided in five minutes to invite former US Chief of Staff MacArthur to Manila as a military advisor. He asked MacArthur, "I only ask you to answer one question: Can the Philippines be defended?" MacArthur replied, "Yes," and he gave MacArthur full authority.</p>
<p>He is not rich, and the rumors outside are absolutely unreliable. His annual salary is only 15,000 yuan, and he himself is very fond of extravagance.</p>
<p>The wife he loves the most is his first cousin, beautiful and talented, and a Catholic.</p>
<p>Quezon is proficient in English, Spanish, and Tagalog, and can speak in three languages. He used to devote himself to the Philippine independence movement, but now he is not sure whether independence is necessary.</p>
<p>General MacArthur and the Philippine General Staff both believe that the Philippines can defend itself. They all believe that air attacks on the Philippine Islands will not be effective, and infantry invasions are even more impossible. The Philippine army trains 40,000 new recruits every year and can become a strong force. However, the Philippines lacks the industrial equipment necessary for modern warfare, and it does not have a fleet to resist the Japanese navy.</p>
<p>Politically, the Philippines is at least in theory a progressive democratic country, but economically it still maintains the conditions of the feudal era. This is the legacy of Spanish rule. Industry is mostly controlled by a small number of Spanish aristocrats, and most of the land is also controlled by large landlords or churches. The real farmers cannot even make ends meet.</p>
<p>Quezon has cautiously begun to implement the division of large landowners. But his situation is roughly the same as that of President Roosevelt. If President Roosevelt wants to attack Wall Street, but 70% of his supporters are from Wall Street. Quezon knows that if he wants to truly reform, he must first destroy the feudal system - that is, the Catholic Church. But doing so would undoubtedly destroy himself.</p>
<p>Quezon's opposition is very weak. There is not a single member of parliament who opposes him. All those who oppose him also respect him as the father of the Philippines. What they complain about is nothing more than saying that he is a dictator.</p>

<h3>British Air Defense Weapons</h3>
<p>In the past two months, the air war between Britain and Germany has intensified. German planes are superior in quantity, while British planes are superior in quality. The mainstay of British air defense is superior fighter planes and high-speed destroyers. Secondly, there are anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine gun teams. In addition, there are the following two types:</p>
<p>One is the "Ashbos-style flying fortress." Ashbos is a Hungarian, a famous designer of vertical take-off and landing aircraft. He used to work at the Austrian Aviation Research Institute, and then served in Germany, assisting General Goering in expanding the air force. Not long before the outbreak of the European war, he changed to helping Britain. Each of his designed vertical take-off and landing aircraft has 2,000 horsepower, is equipped with heavy armor, and is equipped with rapid-firing machine guns, which can kill enemy dive bombers. This new type of aircraft is the so-called "flying fortress." It can take off and land vertically without a large airfield. Moreover, even if the parts are accidentally damaged, it can land safely. After taking off, it is extremely agile in intercepting enemy aircraft; at the same time, because of its stable flight, it is easier for machine gunners to aim. Because of these advantages, it is most suitable for defending densely populated areas. The "flying fortress" made according to his design can be used as a fighter in small sizes, and as a transport plane in large sizes, each carrying 50 people. On the other hand, because it can hover and aim in the air, it can also become the best bomber. Now a small number of these aircraft have been built and will be used to protect the skies over London.</p>
<p>The second is the aerial minefield. This device for defending against enemy air raids is a recent invention. Its setup is to raise hundreds of balloons, each five feet in diameter, into the air to a height of about 30,000 feet, each balloon attached to a small bomb with a 40-foot-long line. If an enemy plane hits a bomb, it will definitely be greatly damaged or even crash to the ground. It is said that it only takes two people to release one in 30 minutes, and they can be adjusted to float at any predetermined height. The manufacturing cost of aerial mines is very low, so they can be used in large quantities to defend cities and military targets. Another type that uses balloons is called "anti-aircraft balloons." The main function of this anti-aircraft balloon is the large iron cable it tows. After the balloon rises, the iron cable is pulled tight, and if an aircraft hits the iron cable, it can immediately be shattered. With this equipment in the air, it forces the attacking aircraft to not be able to perform dive bombing or low-flying strafing. As for the position of each balloon, it is scientifically distributed; the placement position also needs to be changed frequently to confuse the enemy aircraft. Its release is under a strict and witty command, just like commanding an army to fight. The height of ascent is also determined by the commander based on the situation. After such an aerial Bagua formation is formed, it is not easy for enemy aircraft to enter and exit this iron cable circle. According to the report of Secretary of War Eden, this type of anti-aircraft balloon has captured several German aircraft, which shows its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a newly invented "predictor." It can predict when an enemy aircraft will fly to a certain point, so that anti-aircraft guns can accurately hit it, or send a fleet of aircraft to intercept it. There is also a type called "mobile searchlight" that can illuminate an aircraft as it flies overhead, so that it cannot hide at all.</p>

<p>Old News Re-copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (486) (See the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>— The Sanjiang Literary School</p>
<p>Regarding the writing style of the imperial examination, predecessors all discussed it in terms of trends, truly the words of Chu! The eight-legged essay is different from policy essays, memorials, poems, and fu, etc., in that it must have a certain scope. Even if one boasts of talent and displays temperament, one still follows the rules. Therefore, those who learn it are like women tracing flower patterns. From childhood to adulthood, there is a time for improvement in skill, but the method never changes. Since it is like a flower pattern, then it can be changed and innovated endlessly. When it is popular, thousands of people imitate it. If it is not successful, then it is not in style. Since the establishment of the imperial examination system at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, the first examination tested four-book essays in seven sections, now changed to three sections. The essays of the early Ming Dynasty were plain and bland. In the sections, there were several sentences that tightly grasped the whole topic and elaborated on its meaning, which were considered masterpieces. By the Chenghua, Hongzhi, Zhengde, and Jiajing periods, it had changed slightly. The tightly refined parts gradually increased, the concluding sentences were solemn, and the conception was difficult. It was a transition from simplicity to magnificence. Then in the Longqing and Wanli periods, it changed again; in the Tianqi and Chongzhen periods, it changed again. Generally speaking, magnificence was slightly embellished, and the skill was further advanced. By the early Qing Dynasty, it was considered the most prosperous period, with writing style and substance complementing each other, and both the virtual and the real being present. The structure also gradually became new and beautiful. By the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods, it was pure and refined, broad and prosperous, even and balanced. The mastery of current affairs essays reached its peak at this point. Then, when things reached their extreme, they changed. After purity, novelty was occasionally added. From then on, it went downhill, avoiding the common and familiar in the questions, and cutting off without reason; using novelty in the writing, and adding unnecessary details. The paired style was gradually abandoned; the erudite words were generally deleted.</p>

<h3>A Contribution to Children Who Are About to Start School</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Children! In this turbulent era, our schools are about to start again. Before school starts, let's review whether our vacation life has been meaningful, whether our bodies and studies have improved, and how much progress we have made in our vacation homework. At the same time, we must think that there are tens of thousands of children across the country who do not have the opportunity to study, and there are also many studious children who have lost their schooling due to the closure of summer tutoring schools. We can still go to school and study, but we are not forced, and we do not strive forward. Isn't this shameful?</p>
<p>When the semester starts, children will meet again, and there will inevitably be a lot of excitement and joy. However, they do not know that the tuition fees for this semester have also increased due to rising prices, and how anxiously their parents are planning. In addition, children are unwilling to take care of their belongings. In addition to buying new books, they also have to add school supplies, but these items have all risen in price. Even the worst five-cent notebooks cost more than one yuan a dozen. Therefore, parents have added burdens. If children do not know how to cherish and save, it will be too late to regret when they are unable to buy.</p>
<p>The following is a brief explanation of how to save on school supplies:</p>
<p>1.  Schoolbag: It is best to make it yourself, because if you buy it on the market, they will add labor costs to the fabric price, so it is extra expensive. When you make it yourself, you only need a piece of cloth, and you can make various styles as you like. If you like beauty, you can embroider flowers or paste cloth on the corners of the bag. Fabrics such as bamboo cloth and twill cloth that are not easily soiled, such as dark-colored shilin cloth, are much more durable than those bought.</p>
<p>2.  Books: The paper in the books that children read is very thin. If they are not taken care of, they will be damaged in a few days. Therefore, after we buy new books, we immediately wrap them with book covers, replacing them as they break. At the same time, we should not scribble on the books, and place them flat in a fixed place after reading. In this way, our books will still be new when the semester is over.</p>
<p>3.  Pencil: It should not be written too sharp and long. If it is too sharp and long, it is easy to break off and is not durable.</p>
<p>4.  Paper: Children should get rid of the habit of changing paper. When we start writing, we should have the idea of writing well. Sometimes we accidentally make a mistake, we mark it as invalid next to it and supervise ourselves not to change a single piece of paper. Later, we will naturally write well.</p>
<p>Schoolbags, books, pencils, and paper are the main items of school supplies. I have briefly described some saving methods. Other things like erasers and blades should also be cherished. I offer these little ideas to children who are starting or have not started school, hoping that you will earnestly implement them.</p>
<h3>A Word to Teachers on Organizing Summer Homework</h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>Children are children after all. It is not easy to have perseverance in whatever they do. If you want children's work to be successful, it all depends on the patient guidance of the teachers. Now that the summer vacation is coming to an end and schools are about to start, I would like to offer a suggestion to the teachers for the summer homework competition. In the first week after school starts, focus on organizing summer homework. If you find children who have not finished their homework, encourage them to complete it as soon as possible. First, hold a competition for the number of summer homework submissions in each grade. Give a model class banner to the grade with the most submissions. This is an easy task to do. Using children's competitive psychology to complete summer homework has many benefits and no harm. Secondly, hold an exhibition of summer homework test papers from each grade in the school. Invite parents to the school to visit to show the school's seriousness about summer homework. This is a good way to gain the trust of parents. Of course, the best way is to not only exhibit summer homework, but also to judge it. The school should give some rewards to those with excellent results. This is also a way to be generous without spending much. Then, collect them and send them to the head office of this newspaper before September 15. The competition for the number of submissions and the achievement exhibition can all be designed as connected units. Leaving aside the inherent value of the summer homework competition, these matters alone have considerable educational effects. I believe that the teachers have already thought of and planned for this.</p>
<h3>Bombardment</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>The news reported the other day that "The southern coast of England was bombarded by German long-range artillery. The top floors of two private houses were bombed and collapsed. Shrapnel rained down on the roofs of nearby houses. Windows within a half-mile radius were shattered..." This news caught the eye of Yong'er, but it aroused his attention.</p>
<p>"The German artillery on the French coast can actually bombard the English border. Modern military weapons are truly becoming more and more sophisticated. I wonder how huge this artillery is." After reading the news, he thought blankly. He also told his father about the news and asked him to talk about the general situation of this artillery. At this time, his brother Zong'er also came over.</p>
<p>"This long-range artillery was invented by the German Army General Staff in 1918, the year when the First World War in Europe was about to end. The motivation for the invention was that the air forces of Britain and France were very active, and Germany's air raids on various places were ineffective. Therefore, they came up with a method of using artillery to bombard the French capital, Paris. This was just an ideal. Who knew that the ideal would actually become a reality and was accidentally discovered by the German artillery. The caliber of the artillery was very large, and the angle between the artillery body and the ground was also very large, almost standing the artillery body upright on the ground. In this way, the height of the shell fired was more than twice that of ordinary artillery, that is, the shell was rapidly fired straight into the sky. Therefore, in the summer of 1918, Paris was bombarded by more than 300 shells. The structure of this artillery was kept secret by Germany and not made public. Later, I don't know how it was publicly announced: the weight of the artillery was 750 tons, and the artillery tube was a thick steel tube, more than one meter thick and three or four meters long. The shell was also more than one meter long and weighed about 300 pounds. The shell contained 400 pounds of gunpowder, so when a shell was fired, the explosive force of the shell had about 70,000 pounds of pressure, plus the weight of the shell, it was unimaginable. Since the shell was so heavy, how could it be fired to such a long distance? The artillery used mechanical force to make an appropriate angle with the ground, and then fired the shell. The speed at the moment it left the muzzle reached 2,000 meters per second. At this time, the air resistance also increased, but it could not resist the force of the shell. This fast speed was to make the shell reach a very high altitude layer, where the air was thin and the resistance was reduced, so that the shell could be fired to a very long distance, and then the shell fell rapidly and exploded at the destination. As for how to hit the destination, military experts made precise calculations beforehand. This was only more than 20 years ago. In modern times, almost every country has long-range artillery, and it is much more precise than before."</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (13)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>At first, our bodies were only 36 inches tall, but now we are gradually growing taller. I personally have grown to 40 inches, and other children are even taller than me. At this height, it is really unreasonable to be babies anymore, so our set of "Baby Take a Bow" films ended like this. I said goodbye to those children as if I was reluctant to leave. We had worked together for more than a year, loved each other, and became good friends, and we often played together.</p>
<p>There was a little girl who I liked the most. I spent the most time with her. Whenever I was filming, she was always with me. Before, I filmed "Stand Up and Cheer!", "Little Miss Marker", and "The Littlest Rebel". She never missed a single one. I think it will be the same when I film other films in the future. Coco, do you know why? Because she is my stand-in.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you what a stand-in is. Originally, her figure was the same as mine, and the clothes she wore were the same as the clothes I wore in the film. She and I were like a pair of twin sisters, but the faces did not have to be exactly the same. As for what this stand-in does, I also have to tell you clearly. Originally, I didn't understand this matter, but my good friend Jamie Dunn told me. Whenever I was about to film a scene, the cameramen, soundmen, and lighting men had to test it in advance. The cameraman wanted the lead actor to sit in the designated place so that he could calibrate the lens and avoid the problem of inaccurate lenses in a hurry. The soundmen and lighting men also wanted you to sit in the designated place to do some preliminary work.</p>
<p>But the lead actor is often very busy before officially appearing in front of the camera and doesn't have time to sit there and let them test. She has to comb her hair, tidy up her clothes, or practice new dance steps and sing new songs in the dressing room, which are all needed in this new film. However, even if you don't have time, the cameramen still have to test it, so they have to find a stand-in to represent everything. But as I see it, this is also a very hard job, because the testing time is very long, you often sit still and can't move, and the hot lights are always shining on you, almost making you unable to open your eyes.</p>
<h3>A Letter Discussing Writing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— He Ren</p>
<p>Hua Di, Ming Mei:</p>
<p>I had just received your letter when I heard the air raid siren. I hurriedly put your letter in my bag, took some important things, and hid in the air raid shelter. I barely finished reading your letter by the dim light. In today's China, it is such a rare and special opportunity for you to be able to talk about books and write at home in peace. Don't let it go lightly. You should work harder and forge ahead so as not to disappoint the thousands upon thousands of people who are risking their lives and fighting desperately. — You must always remember that they are risking their lives and fighting desperately for you! Enough of the idle talk, let's get down to business. — You are particularly happy to write during the summer vacation, so you specially wrote a letter to discuss the practice methods with me. However, you asked: What is the most effective way to practice? This is a bit difficult to answer. Even if the method is good, whether it is effective or not depends on your own efforts. One of the subjects I am currently studying is how to teach elementary school students. One part of it is about "how to teach elementary school students to practice writing." Now I will write out what I have learned from reading, which can be used as a reference for you:</p>
<p>(1) First, you must write correctly, neatly, and quickly. The most important thing for elementary school students to practice writing is to pay attention to practicality. The first step is to write each character correctly, without adding a stroke or omitting a stroke, and without inverting the shape. The second step is to write each line neatly and straight. The third step is not only to write clearly, so that it can be recognized at a glance, but also to look pleasing to the eye. However, in the modern world, things must be done quickly, and writing must of course be done quickly.</p>
<p>(2) You don't necessarily have to copy calligraphic models all the time when practicing writing. When we mention practicing writing, we think of copying calligraphic models. In fact, why do elementary school students have to copy calligraphic models? For example, the elementary textbooks you read when you were young have very good regular script characters on them. You can copy them, making use of waste and killing two birds with one stone. Also, there are many letters and notes written by adults, advertisements on the street and in schools, advertisements in newspapers, etc., many of which have very good handwriting. As long as you pay attention everywhere, there will be no shortage of materials for practice.</p>

<h3>A Record of Miss Li Xiaqing's Visit to the United States</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Co-starring in "Air Combat Competition" for Another Purpose</p>
<p>Aspiring to Develop Aviation, Not Interested in the Silver Screen</p>
<p>This article is a record of an interview with Miss Li Xiaqing by Ms. Liang Mamei (Mannie Louise Leung), a female Chinese reporter in the United States. Ms. Liang often writes for major newspapers in the United States and enjoys a high reputation. It is now excerpted and translated by Mr. Qinghui for the readers. (Editor)</p>
<p>It was a clear morning. Miss Xiaqing, in her morning dress, had her hair curled up around her head in a semi-circular shape. She wore a grey-green dress with light red flowers, topped with a light green shawl, making her look extremely exquisite. Her skin was very delicate, her mouth was like a ripe cherry, her face was oval-shaped, her eyebrows were curved, and her body was tall. At first glance, she was a typical Cantonese woman.</p>
<p>After I introduced myself, she smiled and invited me in. The furnishings in the room were purely Western-style. While she removed the newspaper from the sofa, she repeatedly offered me a seat. It seemed to be her comfortable home, both peaceful and gentle.</p>
<p>After she settled down, she waited for the guest to ask questions, her eyes twinkling, revealing that she was a smart and courageous woman.</p>
<p>So I asked her about her memories of being in film as a child, how many places she had been to, where she had learned aviation, how many years she had lived abroad, whether she had recently been writing, and her future hopes, etc...</p>
<p>The following is her answer.</p>
<p>"Speaking of my appearance on the screen, I am no longer very interested. At that time, my stage name was "Li Dandan," but after wandering around Europe and the United States for a few years, I abandoned the stage name "Dandan" and changed to my current name. Therefore, my film career is simply not worth recalling.</p>
<p>"I lived in Europe for four years and in the United States for one year. I studied aviation in Switzerland for four years. Because Switzerland and France are neighbors, I often went to France as well. I have been to most places in Europe and the United States that have air routes.</p>
<p>"Regarding writing, I am ashamed to say that I have only written one book in my life, "The Romance of Airways in China." The content of this book is dedicated to everything about aviation, my own experience in aviation, and the necessity of promoting the development of aviation. If time permits, I would also like to write a "Flying Across America" book recently. Maybe you think I am too daring!</p>
<p>"As for my future hopes, I want to fly to every corner of the world. This will not only truly develop what I have learned and fulfill my past aspirations, but also greatly promote China's aviation industry. Not only that, but I also hope to work hard for the aviation industry for the rest of my life, and I hope that every Chinese person will have rich aviation knowledge and increase the strength of national defense.</p>
<p>Finally, I asked her if she had any intention of continuing to make films in Hollywood? She suddenly blushed and was unhappy, as if she had been greatly insulted. She said: "My decision to co-star with Miss Dolores Lamour in "Disputed Passage" is on the one hand to promote aviation, and on the other hand to send the proceeds from filming back to the motherland as donations. I have no intention of appearing on the screen again. After that, I will continue to raise funds until the victory of the war of resistance for national reconstruction is achieved."</p>
<h3>Actors' Private Lives Need to be Taken Seriously</h3>
<p>In order to promote newcomers, the National Drama Association recruited more than 20 male and female trainees two months ago, hoping that they would work hard to study during the training period and then be given acting opportunities. Unexpectedly, a small number of them thought that once they were admitted, they would be stars, and they did not study hard. Instead, they went in and out of song and dance halls all day long, giving people a bad impression. It is heard that the National Drama Association authorities believe that these few people are really unteachable and will be fired. A reporter from the Hai Xing News Agency asked Mr. Han Langen, the director of the National Drama Association, about this yesterday. He said that the authorities may handle it this way, but it is not completely decided yet. The reporter believes that the private lives of film actors really need to be taken seriously. Those who cannot repent and start anew, even if they have genius acting skills, it is not a pity to abandon them.</p>

<h3>The Final Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Bad News</p>
<p>He added, "I've also sent a telegram to the Suzhou Police Department to investigate Li Shouqi's whereabouts."</p>
<p>I asked in surprise, "Li Shouqi? Who is he?"</p>
<p>"He's Li Zhiban's son, the deceased's cousin. He came to Shanghai on the seventeenth, stayed at Lilan's house for one night, and returned to Suzhou early on the eighteenth. According to Mr. Huo, this person may also have some relationship with the deceased. Therefore, when I was leaving, I asked the old man, and he said that his son was a teacher at the Suzhou Nursery School, so I sent a telegram to ask. If he really arrived in Suzhou during the day on the eighteenth, then we can reduce a suspect, and we can concentrate our attention during the investigation without being too distracted." He paused, and added, "In my opinion, the suspicions against this Mr. Yu and Mr. Zhao are very strong. There is really no need to be distracted by other people."</p>
<p>I nodded. "I agree with that. Is there any other information?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinying said, "Officer No. 202 was assigned to the Datong Road post from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. last night. According to his report, at around 12 o'clock last night, there was indeed a black car parked on Datong Road near the corner of Qingpu Road."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but interrupt and say, "In that case, Old Mao's words were really true."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied, "Yes, No. 202 also saw another car at the same time, parked on the west side of the open space on Qingpu Road, only three or four doors away from No. 27. I think this car is also related."</p>
<p>I hurriedly replied, "Of course. Did he pay attention to the license plate number?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "No, but that green-cornered car looks like a taxi. It's not difficult to investigate. I've also sent people to investigate in this area." (86)</p>
