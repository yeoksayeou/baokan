<p>貝當說明改組原因</p>
<p>維希貝當元首頃於本日改組內閣、將內閣協理兼外長賴伐爾免職、改命中央派領袖前任內閣總理佛蘭亭繼任外長、同時敎育部長黎貝爾亦已提出辭呈、而由歇伐利埃繼任、關於此事、貝當元首並親向全國人民發表廣播演說、說明此决改組內閣、純係出於內政上理由、絕不致影響法德兩國現行關係、其原詞如下、「法蘭西同胞乎、余已採取一種適合國家利益之決定、卽內閣協理兼外長賴伐爾業已去職、不復爲內閣閣員、所遺外長一職、改由佛蘭亭繼任、</p>
<p>憲法草案條款修正</p>
<p>憲法草案第四條卽關於規定繼任元首者亦已予以撤消、（按該條規定元首一席、他日應由賴伐爾繼任）余爲使政府機關統一充實起見、決定取消協理公署、而原附屬協理公署之情報部亦改隸政府、憲法草案第四條茲修正如决、「如元首因故不能執行職務時、其繼任人選由內閣會議決定、」余作此項決定、純係出於法政上之理由、絕不致影響吾國與德國之邦交、余仍爲國家元首主持中樞、而吾國復興工作、亦當賡續進行」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>情報機關直隷政府</p>
<p>維希法國內閣改組後、情報機關亦不復由內閣協理管理、而改由內閣總理鮑多恩直接管轄矣、該機關秘書長卡薩拉將由衆議員貝傑來繼任、（十五日海通社電）</p>

<p>傅賴伐爾喪失自由</p>
<p>紐約「紐約世界電聞」昨日稱、該報昨日自可靠方面得悉、法警察已將副總理賴伐爾加以逮捕、押解於一未經公佈之地點、該報又稱、賴氏赴德前夕，法警察會往其寓决進行搜查、並沒收其報紙、又悉、希特勒　賴伐爾之談話、係在取得維希之准許、俾德軍可假道未經佔領之法境前往援　、據悉貝當兀首對此建議表示反對、而賴伐爾則予以支持云、（十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>維希　賴伐爾之下落、至今日下午仍爲一神秘之事、傳說不一、有謂賴伐爾在其維希附近之私邸中、受警察之監視、惟有一事可以斷言者、卽賴伐爾之同僚則仍被貝當上將之衛隊監禁在旅館中（十五日海通電）</p>
<p>維希內部政見參差</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交記者稱、維希政府要人賴伐爾免職、以前總理佛蘭亭繼任副總理兼外長、此事雖表示維希內部意見之嚴重參差、然未必卽是維希政府政策轉向之謂、佛蘭亭爲民治同盟黨黨魁、惟素有傾向全能政體之趨勢、慕尼黑會議後渠致希特勒之電、曾引起法國人民之反對情緒、自法國潰敗後、渠常與敵方接近、當賴伐爾初决抵巴黎入見德當局時、德方正與佛蘭亭晤談、使賴伐　待於他室、卽此可見德方與佛蘭亭接近之一斑、賴伐爾不得民心、已非一朝一夕、今貝當七將罷免其兩職、殆已不復信任之矣、惟佛蘭亭能吾使貝當贊成其爲人共知之觀念而獲較大之成功、尚待日後事實證明之、阿爾巴爾尼與里比亞兩處軍情之轉變、定使法國淪陷區與非淪陷區皆生反饗、如其未也、則亦深可異矣云、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>維希氣象一度緊張</p>
<p>維希賴伐爾之去職與佛蘭亭之入閣、使維希呈現緊張之氣象、法國內閣於昨日午後五時至七時舉行會議、並未發表公報、而一小時後復召集國務會議、當時戒備嚴密、至午夜前賴伐爾始含笑步出會塲、目光下注、手中携文件一束乘汽車駛去、目的地未經宣佈、旋卽探悉內閣協理兼外長賴伐爾已於晚間十時十五分辭職云、（十五日海通電）</p>
<p>法國輿情力量增强</p>
<p>倫敦法人通訊社稱、賴伐爾之脫離維希政治舞臺、乃法國輿情力量增强、可左右政府決定之明證、法人憎惡賴氏日見其甚、故國內外之法人皆贊成貝當上將所發爲國家利益計、故免其職之言論、英軍在非洲之勝利、已使法人愈堅其對於法德密切協作政策之仇視、故主張此種政策者勢非去職不可、惟佛蘭亭之爲人、殊未有恢復英法接近政治之保障、渠之任命或將採生出人意外之種種事件、然頓氏之去職，乃輿情所促成、佛蘭亭當亦知之、或不致再蹈覆轍、而抱法人可服從德方制度之希望云、（十五日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c5">法蘭西悲運中的政變 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>據昨日的維希消息，法國貝當元首於十四日改組內閣，將內閣協理兼外交部長賴伐爾免職，另以鮑多恩及佛蘭亭分別繼任總理及外長；幷且從現行憲法草案中，根本廢棄了協理繼承元首資格的條款；這是法國棄戰言和而後第一次改組內閣，這是重大的政治風波，也是自極權政制成立以來最劇烈的一個變動。這不單顯示着法國政情方面的不安，同時更洩露了維希政府所遭際的困難正因歐局動盪日甚而有加無已。事情雖然不能謂可驚，但無論如何，總是貝當政權對德決定納款之際所決不若此想像的。</p>
<p>今夏法國對德簽訂停戰協定之初，歐局情勢方陷於極端混沌。軸心威望亦復如日中天，因之若干自信不足者流曾盛讚貝當等人的勇敢，肯冒大不韙而拯救法國，即在貝當政權當局彼時亦曾以謀取光榮的和平自詡；及至停戰協定條件宣佈，世人已　然於戰勝國家初未必能具有慷慨大量的美德，而法國得獲和平的代價，不僅是三分之二的國上被佔領，解散軍隊和移交武器，而其未來命運自始滯留在縹緲的境界之中，一切懸侍英德戰事的最後結局。其後時日愈進，法國的困境便愈顯露，德軍供應浩繁，法人餓莩載途，屬領紛紛離析，人心皇皇浮動，而允以十月下旬德國對法發動的合作談判爲維希政權的絕大難關。那一談判，經過賴伐爾的僕僕往返以至希特勒貝當的會談，雖僅以成立原則上的合作協定而告一段落，德國方面却始終不曾停止邀取法方助德作戰的企圖，同時也就伏下了此度內閣改糾的遠因。至此乃充分證明了法國不只沒有保全了光榮，甚至連和平也未能獲得；停戰屈服的報酬，只是無窮的誅求與困擾；試讀十月十日貝當的告民衆書，充溢了沈痛，當不難想像法國投降後遭遇了何等的悲慘與疾苦。</p>
<p>因爲法國是由一等强國陡降至遭受宰割奴役的地位，因此而使法國人民所感受的凄苦，更非波捷等新興國家抑或丹荷等弱小國家可此；加以德法世讐，成見極深。驟令其改變心理以接受德國支配，與德提携合作。這是違反了人性而爲事實所難能，以是乃更形成法國人民與維希政府間的重大陰翳。以賴伐爾爲首的法當局一派。乃日夕以消除宿怨依附德國相絮聒，甚且主張接受德國割讓亞爾薩斯洛林二州領土一類的要求，以換取「和平」的實現。自無怪其爲一般法國人民所悲憤　加以棄唾和秤擊。原來極權政制的基礎，只有對外建立功業纔能建樹，如其對內絕對集權，對外則唯知屈辱。其政權當然絕無鞏固的可能。賴伐爾以投機政客驟親大權，既乏功業可言，復非信仰所寄、其對德力主屈服，無非根據着一種極渺茫的希冀：析其論據，祗有英國戰敗纔能相形而改進法國地位，因而主張不惜任何讓步以助德國。殊不知英國果眞崩潰，德將爲所欲爲，法國未來地位必不免益陷悲慘，而英之戰敗又尚爲不容想像的事。則際此英國地位日見增强。軸心形勢漸形不利之際，賴伐爾路綫更形逆轉，即使其個人仍繼續保持其一貫見解。其如不能强使法方上下盲從何？十一月中旬。羅蘭德軍强迫法人遷移一舉，德方謂係根據希特勒與賴伐爾會議時所成立的合作諾言。維希方面則堅決予以吾認：終致德力不能不暫時停止强迫遷移之舉，那正是賴伐爾政治生命趨於沒落的暴露。</p>
<p>前此世人多疑貝當元首僅是賴伐爾的工具，賴伐爾亦有得意忘形。飛揚跋扈之觀：到了現在，可以證明其不然。至少在近三數月間的若干舉措當中，可以看出二人根本不同之點，如其應付最近德法談判，即其一例。、又如前外長鮑多恩因與賴伐爾衝突去職之後，外長雖由賴伐爾兼任。却另任鮑多恩爲總理公署秘書長，並膺貝當腹心之寄，主持其所最爲重視的靑年運動，那都可以看做貝當此度發動政變的佈局。此外貝當還模仿德義兩國辦法上進行法國衝鋒隊的組織。凡此一切。都可以看出貝當確在賴伐爾路綫之外另有其重大抱負。然而無論如何，今日的維希政權終屬寄託在德方勢力之下。並適應停戰協定的屈辱條件而產生。除非歐局完全改觀，無法根本改變其註定了的悲運。更看此度內閣改組。總理一職雖以鮑多恩繼任。外長則任命了一向主張親德，且傳聞近頃方受德方十分垂靑的佛蘭亭；則其未　政策，在方式上容與賴伐爾有異。但　不可能跳出與德密切合作的屈辱窼臼。是以維希政權此度改組、事實上仍舊無法减輕其當前的重大困難，更談不對有何建設性的作爲。而若干不甘降志辱心的法人，目睹英國在戰爭的地位日見堅强，並未隨法國之後而迅速崩圯。亦必不免深悔前此對戰事前途判斷的錯誤與停止與英比肩作戰的失策，這是一個慘苦的敎訓。同時也是維希方面日益加甚的難題。</p>

<h3 id="c44">貝當與賴伐爾　中道仳離的原因 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>貝當前在六七月間，對外則向德義兩國斡旋停戰，對內則廢止民治樹立獨裁，原是與賴伐爾唱着「雙簧」的，未及數月卽以中道仳離聞，其故安在？這時紐約泰晤士報駐瑞士京城訪員上月二日所發出的長途電話報告，譯錄於後，以供參考：</p>
<p>法國著名反英政治家某氏，近自維希至瑞士遊歷，據其向人談稱，法國政府中希望英國戰敗的一派，已逐漸失勢，而貝當元首個人的聲望，却有一日千里之勢。歐洲重見和平的道路，遙遠而多荊棘。英國的抵抗力已經持續了很久，且有愈戰愈强的模樣，法國反英份子，因乃狐疑百出，而親英的情緒也就漸决溢於言表了。</p>
<p>維希政府所行的復興與建設計劃，勢須排　端賴德國的援助。除異己，肅淸導成戰爭的各種至於義國政府的態度，仍主張，但道項計劃能吾完成，堅持其對法提出之領土要求，數日來軸心各國報紙的論調，亦復此響彼應，致使維希政府大失所望，據聞，時局如此轉變，卽副總理兼外交部長賴伐爾亦難以向政府同僚自圓其說。賴伐爾最近曾在巴黎聲明，決心排除「外國勢力的干涉」，其意蓋謂將以全力消滅英國在法國境內的宜傳工作，並使同情特戈爾將軍者的聲勢不再蔓延。賴伐爾爲促成此項政策起見，曾希望德國實意接受法國的「合作」，支持法國反對義國領土要求。</p>
<p>此外，賴伐爾聞曾壓迫貝當元首，接受軸心國所提要求，而將法國在地中海方面的幾處海軍根據地，割讓德義兩國，甚至願將法國海軍一部份艦隊，供給德義進攻英國。但貝當上將堅決主張對英保守「光榮的中立」，對於此項提議，始終予以拒絕。</p>
<p>目下法國未佔領區域內，一方散佈謠言。不遺餘力一，方闢謠辨正亦覺應接不暇。但貝當上將在位一日，其態度卽一日不變，則似可斷言。貝當對於賴伐爾所接受之「和平協定」條款，聞極憤慨。要之，無論貝當在其他方面失策如何，彼決不致聽任法國軍隊助敵攻英云。</p>

<p>— 李德明</p>
<p>四月　四六，〇〇元</p>
<p>五月　四一、〇〇元</p>
<p>六月　六六、二五元</p>
<p>七月　六八、四三元</p>
<p>八月　六五、七五元</p>
<p>九月　七五、六二元</p>
<p>十月　八五、五〇元</p>
<p>十一月　八七、〇〇元</p>
<p>根據上表所示，吾人可知在民國二十六年以前，米價以民國二十三年之一二、五〇元爲最高，二十六年「八一三」戰事爆發後，米價雖略漲，然直至民國二十八年，每石之價格亦不過二四·六二元而已，及至今年，情勢大變，平均米價由一月之四〇元起，步步上騰，至十一月止，已達八十七元，本月四日白粳之價格，且上漲至一〇六元，惟最近已稍見回跌。雖然，仍不能不令人不寒而慄！</p>

<p>上海位於長江南岸之三角洲上，土地肥沃，有江南「魚米之鄉」之稱，故在「八一三」以前，上海之食米來源，極爲旺盛，仰給於國外者，爲數甚少！每年最多不過三四十萬公担而已，「八一三」後，洋米輸入略見增加，但大部份固仍由國內供給也，茲將二十六年至二十八年三年中，洋米輸入之數量，示之於後：</p>
<p>二十六年　三〇七，八六〇公担</p>

<p>九月　一三七，八一〇公擔</p>
<p>十月　五七七，四一一公擔</p>
<p>合計　三，七七九，六二二公擔</p>
<p>此項數字，決不完全，因低報爲商人之慣技。然卽以上數而論：之輸入，除五，九，十各月較少外，其他如三，七八各月，每一月之輸入，皆超過去年中一年輸入總數而有餘，其他如一，二，四，六，十各月，與去年全年之輸入總數，亦相差無幾，總計今年十月以來，洋米輸入總數，竟達三，七七九，六二二公擔，超過二十六年者幾達十二倍，超過二十七年者五倍，超過二十八年者七倍；故國米運滬之數，卽使减少，亦足以抵償而有餘。上海之食糧供需，可謂毫無問題。至於國米運滬，何以减少？一言以蔽之：日人之壟斷來源是矣。</p>
<p>日本之食糧，平時已感不敷，自對華作戰以來，一方面因軍事關係，食糧之需要激增，而另一方面，則因農民之入伍，耕馬之徵發，肥料之不足，生產力一落千丈，去年日本農產品之收入，卽已减少，全國大鬧米荒，問題頗爲嚴重。彼等之唯一希望，卽爲今年能得一豐收，以資抵補，孰料今年日本之本部以及朝鮮，復因旱魃爲災，於是食米再告歉收，根據上本農林省發表之統計，今年日本食米之出產額，共爲三一〇，五〇〇，〇〇〇斗，不僅與日人三五五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇斗預計產額之目標，相去甚遠？卽與其過去四年中之平均產額三三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇斗之數字相較，相差猶達一九，五〇〇，〇〇〇斗，故日本國內，現在正極力减少食米之消費，甚至在米中參雜麥類，以供食用，無如日本今年之麥類收成，亦遠不如去年，故此種辦法，對於日本之食糧恐慌問題，依然不能解決其萬一，因之不得不轉移其目光於國外，據本年十月十日之Far　Fastern　Survey所載，自一九三九年十二月至一九四零年三月止，日本向印度支那半島各國所採購之食米總數，計有二，六〇〇，〇〇〇公擔，在日本輸入總額中，的佔百分之六左右，日本現向國外採購如此鉅額之食米，則勢非動用其外匯基金不可，但彼自對華作戰以來，軍費之支出浩繁，外匯基金，早已枯窘萬狀—何能常有鉅款，供其向外採購糧食。於是彼等乃在蘇浙皖等淪陷區內，利用其軍事上之勢力，以毫無準備之軍用票，强行採購食米，運往日本，據統計，在過去十月中，由中國運往日本之米，共達七，〇〇，〇〇〇公擔之多云。</p>
<h3 id="c47">上海米價上漲之原因 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>然則上海米價上漲之原因，吾人雖不能謂爲與此完全無關，但主要者決不在此。可以食</p>
<p>今日上海食米之存底，究有多少，爲今日上海民衆最關心之問題，但各方所作之報告，皆因其立塲不同而異。米店則故意以多謂少，謂上海存米的在四十萬石左右，使人心因以恐慌，便於彼等從中操縱居奇；行政當局以及輿論機關，則又喜以少報多，誇張過甚，謂上海之存米，有四百餘萬石之多，冀以穩定人心，使投機之米商，無所用其技。</p>
<p>實則按照本文第一節中所述，本年一月至十月，總共進口之洋米，的爲三百五十餘萬公擔，若按十個月平均分配，則每月進口之洋米，的爲三十二萬公擔，的爲四十三萬石左右，本市每月消費之食米，的爲一萬一千石，米價暴漲以來，升斗小民多已吃粥或改食雜糧　代用品，故以人口計算，實已不到一萬一千石，姑以一萬一千石而論。卽每月四十三萬石，則核計除消費外，每月可凈餘十萬石，如此十個月計算，總共之凈餘，應爲一百萬石，再假定十一月中凈餘之數，亦爲十萬石，則上海今日之存米，共一百十萬石，其數足供今日上海全市人口三個月以上消費。然在上海，平時罕有存米百萬石之日，米價則平穩若彼；今雖擁有空前之鉅額存底，米價竟反暴漲若此；顯由米奸等利令智昏，操縱居奇所致。而其中又多富豪大賈。故「慶交不去，魯難未已」也。</p>

<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>什麼叫做勞資糾紛？所謂勞資糾紛，是指雇主與工人間僱傭條件的維持或變更而發生的爭議。在這種爭議中，爲實行個人或團體的。求不以停止工作爲方法，而以和平的折衝獲得解決。簡言之，勞資糾紛便是勞資雙方意志的衝突，而未達到決裂的程度。在形式上性質上與罷工停業截然不同，因罷工停業是以停止工作以求達到目的爲要件的，這樣看來，勞資糾紛是罷工停業的醞釀，也是罷工停業的成因。勞資糾粉，決不是局部問題，是有牽一髮而動全體的情况。打開勞資糾紛的裹層來看，它的發生，十九還是離不了經濟原因。勞資爭議，甚少發生於產業衰落之時；而獨盛於產業復興之後。其原因由於物價上漲，眞實工資低廉勞資利害發生衝突，所以勞工方面因物價上漲，生活費用增高，原有工資之購買力，逐　下降，生活將發生困難，因此勞動者爲求生存計，不得不向僱主要求噌加工資，而其時雇主之經濟情形，實亦可能改善其職工之待遇，若復吝而不與，勞資糾紛，便勢靴幸免了。</p>

<p>糾紛原因與分析</p>
<p>二十六年共發生勞資糾紛案件一三六起，道是從民國十七年以來糾紛案件數最低的數字，這一年案件銳减的原因，可分兩方面來解釋；第一國難嚴重，至二十五年下半年起，工商界頓現蓬勃的氣象，工潮事件急遽轉變，罷工停業一發莫遏，較溫和的糾紛，反因此而相形見絀。第二「八一三」烽火一起，上海工業要區盡成灰燼，抗戰期內，勞資方面，相忍茍安，當然沒有什麼糾紛事件發生，二十六年八月起至年終止僅有六起案件發生，內八月份三起，一起是戰前的，九月份一起，十月十一月份無，十二月份二起，另一方面從關係職工數及關係廠號數看來，二十六年糾紛案件的嚴重性，却較勝於已往的二五年，關係廠號計一·一四七家，職工八一·九八三人，那是民國二十二年來較高的數字，這可以表示二十六年七個月中，在工潮激盪的情勢下，雖發生糾紛案件，並不見多，可是凡所發生的案件，其牽涉較廣</p>
<p>勞資糾紛發生原因，最重要的是僱用解僱，工資待遇，團體協的的等項，二十六年的統計數字中，關於起因於這幾項事件的糾紛，略有變遷，的述如下；</p>
<p>第一僱用解僱是歷年勞資糾紛發生的主因，民國十七年來歷年平均的占全部案件百分之六五·三五，二十六年雖仍爲各項原因之冠，可是發生案件的百分數已銳减至百分之四八·五三，大抵因這一年正當工商復與之時，營業有起色，當然不常發生解僱事件，僱用解僱項下的細目中，如勞方反對解儷的案件，歷年平均百分之五〇·六八，二十六年减至百分之三六·七六，如歇業案件自白分之一〇·四八减至百分之六·六二。</p>
<p>第二，工資案件二十六年度與以往年多無甚變異佔百分之一八·三八。</p>
<p>第三，待遇案件，增加最多，佔百分之一九·一二，一躍而居工資案件之上，這一年大多的廠號，均見羨餘，所以在工資方面的爭執之外，生出許多改良待遇花紅酬勞升工獎金以及其他枝節的問題，於是待遇一項，遂成二十六年僅次於僱用解雇的重要原因了。</p>
<p>第四，團體協的中的關於團協的的履行一項，二十二年以後幾無發生，二十六年獨有叫起，那也許由於工商漸復景氣有幾件懸而未決或延未實行的勞資契的，都舊事重提了，這是二十六年糾紛原因的概略。</p>
<p>其次關於二十七年，糾紛案件爲二十七起，關係廠號數七四家，關係職工數，亦祇二萬餘人，在工潮激盪時期，一年中牽涉廠號數達四千餘家人數達十三萬餘人，抗戰時期內，自非通常時期可比。</p>
<p>二十七案發生原因，以僱用或解僱問題爲最多，計十七起，其中勞方反對解僱工友六起，因歇業而解僱者六起，勞方要求僱用職工五起，其决爲待遇問題計五起，其中二起爲要求發給維持費及獎金，又决爲工資問題計二起，均爲要求增加工資。</p>
<p>爭議原因，分析起米，計二十七年中之一百十二件爭議案，其由於工資者五九件，佔全體五二·六八，由於僱用或解雇者三一件，佔全體二七·六八，二十六年關於工資之爭議案，共百件，估全體三三·六七，關於僱用或解雇之爭議案五四件，佔全體一八·一八，是以二十七年內關於此兩項原因之爭議，其情形雖仍與往年相似，惟其集中之趨勢，則較二十六一末决是二十八年，正是抗戰第三期，上海人口激增，工商業逐漸恢復，加以六七月間，外滙一再暴縮，商人操縱居奇，物價上漲不可遏止，工商企業類皆獲利甚豐，而勞工階級生活大難。工資津貼之爭，遂不可免，罷工糾紛事件自增。</p>
<p>二十八年罷工事件，凡一二一起，自七月至十二月，佔有七十四起，可見下半年度生活費用高漲之影響，關係廠號數四三三家，關係職工數三三·四三三人。</p>
<p>勞資爭議原因，旣在於生活費用之高漲，則工資之增加，以及關於津貼待遇等項之要求，自爲搆成罷工事件之主要原因，關於勞方要求增加工資之案件，凡五九起，佔案件總數百分之四八·七六，此自民國七年至二十七年間平均僅佔百分之二七·七而已，要求改良待遇，包括要求米貼等案件凡十四起，佔百分之一一·五七，以視民國七年至二十七年間之各佔百分之一·八八及一·〇九，超出均多，罷工原因，集中於工作報酬問題，別無其他枝節，於此可見。關於僱傭解雇案件計二〇起，佔百分之一六·五二，昔年平均僅百分之二〇·七</p>
<p>二十八年度因勞資爭執而未釀成罷工停業的糾紛案件，有五九起，關係廠號七八八家，關係職工三一·〇七三人，糾紛原因以關於待遇者爲最多，凡二三起，關於工資者十八起，全年因罷工而遭受之損失，計六五九，二七八·五二元；工資四三三，四七一·三三元。罷工案件一二一起中，關係廠號以一家者爲最多，佔白分之九四·二一。關係職工以一百〇一人至一千人爲最多，佔百分之叫七·九三。遷延日數，大率在二日至十日之間，佔百分之五一·二四。</p>
<p>至二十九年之勞資糾紛，案件重大者，以英商公共汽車電車工人與法商電車汽車工人罷工，其嚴重性爲歷年來所未有，群情另文述之</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>抗建三年來的上海勞資糾紛大的如上所述。由於生活的艱苦勞資糾紛的增長，似是勢所難免，但是要認淸我們的生活怎樣會艱苦？是誰賜與的？假使我們不被侵略，我們的生活即不會如此艱苦！所以我們要安定生活，唯有爭取最後的勝利。而在發生爭議之際，尤應顧全大局，嚴防被惡勢力潛入。此在勞資雙方，都應充分注意。</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十二月十四日—</p>
<p>日將改發鈔制</p>
<p>路透社東京電稱，日本政府因爲日本銀行逐日發行紙幣爲數絕巨，故大藏省將於下屆國會開會時，提出修正日本銀行發行紙幣制度底法律；其內容是據電訊所傳，雖很簡單，不過有兩點是很明白的；（一）照法蘭西自一八七〇至一九二八年辦法可能的規定逐年底最大發行額；（二）設一總準備金，而將金銀幣。金銀條。政府證券。商業證券全行包括在內。將來日本銀行的發行紙幣制度，是不是眞如此的像變戲法般的更改，在日本國會未曾正式加以修正之前，雖不能肯定，但是日本戰時財政金融的顯示毫無辦法，巳不容諱言的了。</p>
<p>日本銀行的發行準備制度，向來卽分現金準備和保證準備。現金準備的內含是金銀幣和金銀條，而保證準備的內舍是公債·政府證劵·證券·票據四類。一九三七年八月中日戰事發生，保證準備中政府證劵一項，已不見發表，事實上是隱藏其他保證項目下去了，不過就一九三七年七月以來日本銀行所發表的準備內含一加觀察，在現金準備方面則由金的評價而提高爲八萬萬元底紙面數字，再减爲名目的五萬萬元；在保證準備方面則證券和票據的增加，三年之後均爲二倍多，公債一項則隨發行額的增加而膨脹。故就日鈔所發表的統計而論，現金和保證準備，早已名存而實亡，變成總公債準備了，固不待今後的改爲總準備金而始然。</p>
<p>至於說照法國的辦法，可能的規定逐年底最大發行額，同樣地是追認事實。戰後保證準備已由一萬二千萬日元一再擴大爲二十二萬日元，限外保證準備早就超過十餘萬萬日元了。如今所謂可能的規定逐年最在發行額，不但將保證準備發行擴大，實在是將發行額想儘量地加以擴大而已。請以電訊所傳的法國辦法爲例而說明之：按法國法蘭西銀行對於紙幣發行額目一八七〇年以來，皆用法律定一最高限制，在限制內所發紙幣的免現準備，一任銀行自由，採用保證準備或竟一無準備都可。若在法定最高限制以外，增發紙幣則非現金準備不可。現在日本因爲並無現金準備，故不得不追認事實的將用法國辦法，以全額保證準備制度來來逐年規定一最高發行額，不出筆者過去所論的。（請參閱十一月十六日金融述評「日銀發行的將來」）</p>

<p>滬西封鎖區域、自於前日開放後、昨日情形、並無何種變化、惟愚園路大西路一帶牆壁上昨突發現大批佈告、其內容爲通知車輛納捐領照、此事頗堪重視、諸安浜等處雖已開放、仍有限制、尙有數處障碍物亦依然未予撤除、茲略詳情如次、</p>
<p>公然張貼勒捐佈告</p>
<p>昨日愚園路大西路憶定盤路牆上、突發現公用局滬西車務分處」及「財政局滬西稽征處」會銜「布告」其內容略謂、「你們行經本區境內各種車輛、不論汽車。人力車。脚踏車。馬車等等、無論營業的、或自備的、均須到極司非而路開納路對門九十二弄內「號本分處登記、再在本稽征處繳納車捐、領取車照、方合定例、不是這樣、不能在本區內自由行駛、現在懇切的警告你們、千萬勿再觀望、」云云、此項係用墨筆寫就、上有紅色印章、唯未說明截止日期及車捐數目、然引已起社會各方之極大重視、僉認爲此係某方進一步乘機牟利之企圖、租界當局除向日方提交涉外、現正縝密嚴正應付、昨日該區域內、除人力車已受限制、非領「照」不能進入外、其餘營業汽車自備汽車及脚踏車等、尙米受有何種阻碍、</p>

<h3 id="c69">美國人的同情心 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>中國駐美大使胡適之先生，在海外爲國宜勞，他的講詞，賺到全美人士對華的同情心。最近，美國醫藥助華會在紐的Woldorf　Astoria大旅館舉行第三屆「一碗飯」全美運動的第一個餐舞會，到二千多人，其熱烈情况，着實使人興奮。胡博士在這個盛會中，有很動人的演說。他以學者的態度，闡明了同情心的眞諦，他抓住了衆人潛在的多種因素，使大家激發出同情心來。在這一篇講稿中，沒有什麼政治作用，我們可當它論文看，希望讀者不要輕輕放過。</p>
<p>我們今晚在此地聚會，不是紀念中國的作戰，我們今晚在此地聚會的眞正目的，是表現美國人士助華的一種純粹高尚的同情心。這種同情心，早已在援華機關團體工作上表現出來了。醫藥助華會暨賑華會今天晚上在此地所開的大會，是美國人士助華熱烈同情的繼續表現。貴會等過去努力熱心，奔走呼號，勸募巨款，購辦大量藥品及這輸用具，不僅加惠難民；而且間接增加中國軍事力量。這是敝政府人民及我個人萬分感激的。</p>
<p>三年前，鄙人從紐約到西部，路過加拿大，沿途經過地方不少，使我發生了不少感想。加拿大及美國人民對中國難民，是有眞正的同情心。讓我來說點事實做證明，有一天，我在華盛頓省司卜更城Spokane一個飯店吃飯，吃完了，有一個穿白色制服的茶房來到我面前給我三塊大洋，笑臉說：「大使先生，這是我一點小小貢獻，請你收下，代我救濟中國難民吧。」這種舉動，不是眞正「同情心」表現麼？</p>
<p>一月前，我的鄰居巴美莉太太Mrs．　Parmelee送一封信來，裏面附了兩張支票，共美金一千元，一張是給美國醫藥助華會，一張是給蔣夫人的，請他們代爲救濟中國難民。兩天之後，我把「希望之書」送去，請她簽名，不幸當晚她竟與世畏辭，那知道她的簽字，就是她的遺筆呢？這種舉動，不是眞正「同情心」表現麼？</p>
<p>晚近成了一種風尚，以經濟的動力和經濟的動機，解釋歷史，譬如美國參加第一决歐戰，據這一派的解釋，完全是因爲美國親濟財政的原因和動機。</p>
<p>因爲這種思想和解釋，就產生了許多新立法，禁止仟何交戰國家，除了南美洲以外，得美國財政上的協助，以爲從此美國就可不再捲入外國戰爭了。</p>
<p>諸位，這種似是而非的經濟派的歷史家，忘記了各人方寸中尚有一個「同情心」，政府可以立法禁止財政上的幫助，但是政府無從立法消滅多種因素所產生的「同情心」</p>
<p>幾個星期以前，紐約泰晤士報記載有六千美國男女，貧富貴賤皆有，捐了三千瓶人血，作爲注射英國受傷兵民之用。該報又說在這六千人之中，女于多於男子，有的已在五十　開外，這種舉動，如何能拿經濟的動機去解釋呢？我們很明白，這完全是一種「同情心」的驅使。</p>
<p>在我一個旅行中，有一位靑年記者問我：「在你旅行全美中，發現了什麼？」我說，我所發現的是美國人對於中國有一百分之一百的同情心」。這位記者說：「胡博士，這種一百分之一百的「同情心」，對於中國有什麼用處？」我回答他：「靑年不要輕視「同情心」。讓我現在告訴你，中國打仗的精神，如是之好，是靠你們的同情心所驅使，正是因爲你們同情心的援助，减少了我們傷兵病民的痛苦，老百姓沒有受飢餓和無房屋居住之苦，不僅此也，他們精神上得了無限的安慰，將來達到我們自由及獨立，還要你們的「同情心」幫助。</p>
<p>諸位中國的朋友，我敢說我的政府和全國人民全心全力的作戰是値得你們的同情，作戰至今，已經三年零四個月了。我們作戰，雖然是爲我們自己生存，也是幫助世界其他國家鏟除民主自由公道正義的整個陣礙，假使日木不是受我國牽制，歐洲戰爭不知又壞到情什麼地步了。</p>
<p>剛剛一年前，我在中美協進社談話，當時我晚，中日戰事不會短時期解決，是因爲日本不會覺悟，不明瞭世界輿論，不會放棄野心而走上和平大道的。我曾告訴你們，我國全體作戰，是有決心，不達最後目的不止。</p>
<p>一年過去了，現我再向你們重行說一遍，中國作戰，不達目的不止，也許還要許多個月才能成功，也許還要幾年才能達到目的。中國決不能停戰，因爲下列三個理由：</p>
<p>（一）現在放棄中國自由獲立，則無希望，現在歐洲情形，是我們的　車。</p>
<p>（二）明興和議（MunichConference）是我們從旁所得的敎訓。</p>
<p>（三）中國勝利與吾，與世界民主主義存亡全爲一事。中國不亡，民主主義不滅。</p>
<p>有此三個原因，故中國不應停戰，最後我要說的，是最後勝利決是我們的。</p>

<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>最近看到報載，有某某學校發起，每日膳食，改爲一粥一飯一麺，而繼起仿效的學校也有，這樣對于學生衆多的學校，確實省了不少食米。但目下的麵粉價格，也昂貴得可以，我們偶然吃幾餐麵，滋味覺得很好，若常吃麵食便會生厭，而且南方人吃米，北方人吃麥，是成爲習慣的，這裏有些人簡直吃不慣麵食哩。</p>
<p>依照前人傳說，普通之家，本來每天祇有二餐，（富室和農戶那是例外的）不知何時起改爲三餐，但習慣成自然，今欲以三餐减爲二餐，事實上也許不可能，不過在這非常時期，一節衣縮食」是人人應當奉行的，現在正是吃苦的時候，我們那可以與平時比擬，試問可憐難民，何曾二餐調勻呢？雖則嬌生慣養的舉生，也不能如往昔的任性放縱，而應該撙節耐苦爲上（筆者猶憶讀書時候，每有中大學生因膳食不佳，摜碗飛碟的事）同時奉請學校當局，應體察全校的學生，如多數爲南方人的話，不妨改爲每天兩粥一飯，這分配是：早晚兩餐吃粥，午餐吃飯，因爲早餐和午餐，距離時間較短，吃粥也足以果腹，（有些人的早餐略吃點心也敷衍過去）午餐距離晚餐時間較長，所以午餐稱爲撐腰飯，自不能省的，待晚餐吃粥，橫豎餐畢須臾將赴睡鄉，亦不致感到飢餓了，若講到經濟，也尚合算，因爲一碗飯至少可化爲兩碗多粥，而現在昂貴的麵粉，吃它也未見便宜多少，（不信但看每付大餅油條已漲到一角了）故筆者貢獻此種愚見，並非專指學校而論，便是孤島上的一般家庭，和工廠等塲所，也未始不可仿行，以符合「縮食的經濟原則。</p>

<p>穿衣服總宜與自己的身分相稱，決不能以風采炫人，能够穿得起筆挺西裝，想來總是在上中流階級的了。可是着西裝，那大有講究，決不能馬馬虎虎瞎着的。偶而在某方面失檢，便大有被認爲所謂「流派」的可能。爰將應注意事項寫下，幸穿西裝諸君均能注意及之。</p>
<p>（一）切勿忘搭袴紐。（二）衣袖不應反折，辦公時可另作兩黑布套。（三）戴帽宜正平，或稍前傾，不可後傾及左右傾。（四）有圍幅的帽子，其幅之接縫，應戴於左側。（五）皮鞋應時常刷凈，母使汚泥黏附。（六）行走地板，勿使大聲。（七）天塞雙手不願插入衣袋或胸際等處。（八）平時須佩帶領帶。（九）無論爲絨製或裘製之領卷，爲婦女，病人，老人所用，年靑者不應濫用。（十）上身西裝，下身中裝；或上身中裝，下身西裝；這種不倫不類，非驢非馬的服裝，最宜免除。</p>
<h3 id="c94">談涮羊肉 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 過宜</p>
<p>羊肉自古以爲美味，故造字者以「美」「羹」「羞」「鮮」等字，皆繫於羊；顧南人往往不嗜羊肉，惡其羶也。曩余旅遊故都，每飯必於羊肉館，取其價廉而適口，偕友一二人同餐，醉飽而歸，付値時輒未溢二元，（此指十年前而言，以今日生活程度之高，當不止此）北方飯館屬於敎門者多，羊肉館之市招，幾於觸目皆是，其偶有一二非淸眞者，俗名之謂大敎館，則大書「猪肉館」三字以爲識別。苟不知共俗，乍見「猪肉館」三字，未有不覺奇異者；然饕餮家多不喜入猪肉館，（猪肉館亦兼售羊肉）謂其精潔不如羊肉館也。余非於羊肉有特嗜，實則北方口味，舍羊肉無複可佐餐者。且北地所產之「大尾巴羊」，其肉不羶，異於南省之羊，故涮羊肉允視爲至味。北平涮羊肉除夏季外，其春冬以及秋季，每家必備。（在八九月間卽烤羊肉亦已上市）累食而不厭。近年寓居上海，以酬酢之繁，必嚴寒天氣，始　及涮羊肉，偶一嘗之，此雖因乎風俗，而亦以此地羊肉之免於羶者少耳。日前王唯我邀飲於馬霍路之源興館，道地之淸眞敎門館也。其饌甚盛，肉亦不羶，涮羊肉一道，鮮嫩視大尾巴羊無甚差別。詢之侍者，答云此羊產於湖州，湖州之羊，或稍遜於大尾巴者，然在南方，卽此已屬難得。源興館其餘各菜，如一煎羊扒」，「扒羊肉條」，「燉羊肉」，「乾炸子鷄」，亦皆有特長，其廚師之佳，招待之股，輒使人回想故都風味不置焉</p>

<p>— 愛農</p>
<p>日前本刊刋載田靑君之大作「臨睡前的幾件事」，頓時引起了筆者的注意，已依照着做了，但對於睡眠後的工作尚未提起；而下列的三件事，係筆者睡眠後所必做的，差不多已有了三年之久，不知不覺中成了習慣，要是有一件忘了幹，那便覺得很不舒適。現在我把它貢獻給尚未有這習慣的諸君，如果能從今天起開始做去，那到了相當時期後，一定有意想不到的效力。</p>
<p>（一）洗凈鼻子：早晨起身後洗臉漱口是少不了的，而在洗險前，盛一盆水，頂好是冷水，然後把鼻子侵在水裏，輕輕的把水一吸，不要過分用力，使冷水吸到鼻中的恰好部分，那就不會覺得難過，再把水噴出來，這樣吸了又噴，噴了又吸的做好多决，便覺得鼻中似乎是格外的暢通。鼻子是人體上很重要的器官，我們無時無刻的不在把空氣通過鼻孔而到肺部，然而空氣中總不免夾雜着麈埃，更有時病菌同混入在灰塵裏，那是多麼危險。幸而鼻孔中有鼻毛，便阻止灰塵的進入，便停留在鼻孔中，如果不把它去除，那便骯髒不堪，所以要把水去洗凈，可以保持鼻子的淸潔，和每天洗臉漱口是一樣的重要。洗了鼻子，更有一巧妙的副作用，就是一旦息了傷風（感冒），鼻子似乎閉塞不通，如果天天用冷水洗鼻子，不但可以預防傷風的傳染，要是不幸的患了，更可以使鼻孔不覺得阻塞，而暢通如常，不過在咽喉部有些異樣罷了。</p>
<p>（二）冷水洗臉，一般人總喜熱水洗臉，然而用冷水洗臉便有不少的利益，除了節省燃料之外，更可預防流行性感冒的傳染，因爲天天使冷水接觸面部，當然冷水比熱水的刺激性來得强，如果偶一不愼，感受到了一些寒氣，也不要緊，因爲臉部的抵抗力因冷水時常刺激而增强，所以受了些寒氣，滿不在乎，要是冷水洗浴，那是格外好了。</p>
<p>（三）喝杯鹽湯，洗臉漱口後，乘着肚子空時，喝杯鹽湯，那效力雖大不犬，却也不小了，因爲食鹽有防腐作用，如果咽喉乾燥或發炎時，喝些鹽湯也有效力，而在肚子空時，可以潔凈胃腸，因爲隔夜吃下去的東西，過了一夜，已都消化了，不過在胃腸中總遺留些殘屑，假使不去除，便要腐爛，喝些鹽湯下去，便可使胃腸頓時潔凈了。</p>
<p>這上列三件事須有恒心，天天做，月月幹，年年行，那麼醫生那裹，不會去請敎了。</p>

<p>偶閱『警聲月刋』，內有一文對本市南京路。正豐街。石路等三路路名之由來，陳述頗詳；實爲本地人士所不可不知，故特錄之於後，以寄本刊。</p>
<p>南京路：當中國首都在北平，而英租界最稱完善之大馬路，乃名南京路，反以北京路殿其後，意者在方向南北之區別乎，抑以南京路爲本省之都會，尊之爲巨擘乎？其實殊不盡然。中英通商根據於道光壬寅年五口通商之的，卽世所稱南京條的是也。建埠之始，實以此路爲起點，故以南京爲命名，　　晨耳。</p>
<p>正　街：正豐街卽廣東路之別名，考其名稱之由來，當時有一醬園名正豐者，開設於該路之中段，歷年旣久，遝沿稱之。</p>
<p>石路：公共租界之福建路，俗稱石路。考其得名之由來，據傳道光年間，上海城內縣署東首，有一李姓，巨富也，與閘北瞿氏結朱陳之好，李氏盛備奩具嬪於瞿氏，以郭門之外，田畝縱橫，道途崎嶇，李家備大石數千，自河濱（卽洋涇橋）起直達吳淞江，相距咫尺，卽置一石，以利行人，事後因之，行人稱便，遂名石路。</p>

<p>現在不是「重男輕女」的時候了。現在應該「男女平等」</p>
<p>因此，看到了九日本刊任炯君的「尼姑庵的故事」，不禁代我們女千嗚起「不平」來（雖然這是「故事」）。</p>
<p>因爲，我們不能够以爲把女子統統送進了尼姑庵就可以「永不會」生孩子；有了男子在外面還是要「引誘」的！雖然說：「尼姑」打胎是「名正言順」的；因爲沒有「結」過「婚」啊！可是，畢竟不大「雅觀」呢！我的意見是：除了「提倡廣設尼姑庵之外，還得來一個「全國和尚運動」！這樣才能够杜絕一切「不規」行動，使尼姑們可以「安心修道」，免得來什麼「已婚女子例外」等等「例外」的怪調！</p>
<p>但是，那幾個主張把已婚女子一脚踢出的先生們，却可以不必做和尚；因爲自己總不會做出自打嘴巴的事情，去把尼姑們「製造」成「已婚女子」的！</p>
<p>不過，「難題」也有：如果和尙尼姑也來「那末一手」呢？</p>
<p>在下倒也有個「辦法」是；「已婚尼姑也例外」！（罪過罪過！）</p>

<p>— 笠嵩</p>
<p>前些時，聽說甥兒的學校要遷移了，並且將要離家很遠，倒替他担心起來——如馬路上的危險，冬季天氣的寒冷，甥兒年幼，到很遠的地方去讀書，確是一件困難的事。但是後來該校又決定不搬了，家中人都爲之欣喜，以爲這樣仍在附近的學校讀書，可以放心得多。</p>
<p>前天下午，甥兒放學歸來，照例要督促他溫習功課，但是當他提着書包箱走到我面前來的時候，面現警懼之色，並且吃吃地告訴我說：「書被老師收去了。』我很奇怪，忙把他的書包翻開一看，果然祇剩幾本練習簿，敎科書一本也沒有了。我以爲或者是他在校犯過的處罰，把他的書收去以作警戒，第二天一定會發還的；於是問他所爲何事，同時怪他不應該在校中不守規則。但是在詢問之下，我寃枉了年幼的甥兒，他並沒有犯過。他告訴我說：『今天上課的時候，老師叫我們把敎科書都拿出來擺在書桌的角上，老師一本一本的收了去，並且說，這是有「命令」收去的，明天就要有新書發給我們，不要我們再繳費的。』甥兒說到道裹，似乎有點得意起來，孩子們以爲有新書可讀，而父不再化錢，倒反歡欣起來，可是，我却有些懷疑起來：中途換書，自然另有用意，孩子們的讀書問題，是吾將因此而有影響呢？</p>
<p>果然事實來了，在第二天放午學的時候，甥兒跳躍着帶來了校中所換給的新書，遞給我看，首先印入眼簾的，就是「國定小學敎科書」，「色彩」就有點兩樣；細細翻閱之下：算術書內容根本沒有變動，完全照前書翻印而來，常識書盡是些花草樹木，建國簡史，紀念日的來由等等都沒有了；最堪觸目的是國語，內中竟發現許多「滑稽」的字句。</p>
<p>孩子的腦經是一張白紙，不能讓他沾上了汚點，「這是怎樣回事？』二哥却淡淡地說：『××是一所有各的附中，小學部名譽也相當不差，學校當局自然有適當的處置，現在不必乾着急，等到寒假再說。不過也要原諒該校所處的地位，現在校舍一時難尋，好在該校素來有名，決不致辜負孩子們和孩子們的家長的！』</p>

<p>Geneva - General Pétain announced on French radio at 6:45 last night that Foreign Minister Laval had been replaced by Flandin, stating that Franco-German cooperation was progressing and that the National Revolution was also advancing. After the announcement, the French national anthem was played. General Pétain has informed German leader Hitler of the cabinet reshuffle. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vichy - The new French cabinet continued to meet this afternoon. Political observers believe that the French cabinet will undergo further reshuffles. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the cabinet reshuffle, the government issued a communiqué tonight, stating, "President Pétain, in order to enhance the unity of the cabinet, has decided to abolish the position of Vice-President. In the future, intelligence work will be handled directly by the President's office. As far as foreign relations are concerned, this cabinet reshuffle will not affect the current relations between France and Germany. This can be seen from the fact that President Pétain received a cordial telegram from German leader Hitler yesterday, informing him that the remains of the Duke of Reichstadt, the son of Napoleon I, could be returned to France for burial. Moreover, President Pétain also telegraphed to Hitler today, explaining our country's position regarding the reorganization of the central government, and stating that Flandin was appointed as Foreign Minister because, in the President's view, Flandin, with the support of public opinion, could continue to promote the close cooperation policy between France and Germany better than Laval. As the position of Vice-President has been abolished, Laval will no longer be Pétain's successor. If the President cannot continue to govern, his successor will be elected by the Council of State. In addition, the remains of the Duke of Reichstadt are scheduled to be buried next to the tomb of Napoleon I tomorrow, and a memorial service will be held at the Invalides in Paris. President Pétain will not be able to attend the funeral in person due to the current situation, and will send Navy Minister Admiral Darlan and General Laure as representatives."

<p>Vichy - The French cabinet was reshuffled yesterday. The new cabinet members appointed by Marshal Pétain are: Minister of Transportation Peyrouton, Minister of Colonies Major General Platon, and the selections for the Council of Ministers are Alibert, Flandin, Peyrouton, Pucheu, Huntziger, Darlan, Caziot, and Pétain. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Pétain Explains Reasons for Reshuffle</p>
<p>Vichy - Marshal Pétain reshuffled the cabinet today, dismissing Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval and appointing Flandin, the leader of the central faction and former Prime Minister, as Foreign Minister. At the same time, Education Minister Ripert also resigned and was succeeded by Chevalier. Regarding this matter, President Pétain also made a radio address to the nation, explaining that this cabinet reshuffle was purely due to domestic political reasons and would not affect the current relations between France and Germany. His original words are as follows: "French compatriots, I have taken a decision that is in the interests of the country, that is, Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval has left office and is no longer a member of the cabinet. The vacant position of Foreign Minister will be filled by Flandin.</p>
<p>Amendment to the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>Article 4 of the draft constitution, which stipulates the successor to the President, has also been abolished. (Note: This article stipulates that Laval should succeed the President in the future.) In order to unify and strengthen the government, I have decided to abolish the Vice-President's office, and the intelligence department originally attached to the Vice-President's office will also be transferred to the government. Article 4 of the draft constitution is now amended as follows: "If the President is unable to perform his duties for any reason, his successor will be determined by the Council of Ministers." My decision is purely for legal and political reasons and will not affect our country's relations with Germany. I will continue to preside over the central government as the head of state, and our country's reconstruction work will continue." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Intelligence Agency Directly Under Government</p>
<p>Vichy - After the French cabinet reshuffle, the intelligence agency will no longer be managed by the Vice-President, but will be directly under the control of Prime Minister Baudouin. The secretary-general of the agency, Cazala, will be succeeded by Congressman Béguin. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Dictatorial Leader Seizes Power</p>
<p>Vichy - Last night, the elderly Marshal Pétain implemented political reforms, expelling Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval and placing all dictatorial power of defeated France under his own iron fist. This white-haired hero of the Great War revealed on the radio that his actions were entirely due to "internal relations." Pétain appointed former Prime Minister Flandin, who admired Nazi Germany, as Foreign Minister. Shortly after this reshuffle, news came that several French political figures had been arrested and imprisoned in Bourrépeyre, where former Prime Minister Daladier and former Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin were awaiting trial for "war crimes" at the outbreak of the European war. The number of arrests was not clear last night, although news from Bern claimed that Laval, known as Pétain's "right-hand man," was also among those arrested. (International dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Laval Loses Freedom</p>
<p>New York - The New York World-Telegram reported yesterday that it had learned from reliable sources that French police had arrested Vice-President Laval and taken him to an undisclosed location. The newspaper also said that on the eve of Laval's visit to Germany, French police searched his residence and confiscated his newspapers. It was also learned that Hitler's talks with Laval were conducted after obtaining Vichy's permission, allowing German troops to pass through unoccupied French territory to assist. It is said that President Pétain opposed this suggestion, while Laval supported it. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Laval's whereabouts remained a mystery as of this afternoon. There are conflicting rumors. Some say that Laval is under police surveillance in his private residence near Vichy, but one thing is certain: Laval's colleagues are still being held in a hotel by President Pétain's guards. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Internal Political Views Vary in Vichy</p>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the dismissal of Vichy government official Laval and the appointment of former Prime Minister Flandin as Vice-President and Foreign Minister indicate serious differences of opinion within Vichy, but do not necessarily mean a shift in Vichy's policy. Flandin is the leader of the Democratic Alliance Party, but he has always tended towards totalitarian systems. His telegram to Hitler after the Munich Conference aroused opposition from the French people. Since the defeat of France, he has often been close to the enemy. When Laval first decided to go to Paris to meet with the German authorities, the Germans were meeting with Flandin, making Laval wait in another room, which shows the extent of the German's closeness with Flandin. Laval has been unpopular for some time. Now that General Pétain has dismissed him from his two positions, he probably no longer trusts him. However, whether Flandin can successfully persuade Pétain to accept his well-known views remains to be seen. The changes in the military situation in Albania and Libya will definitely cause repercussions in both the occupied and unoccupied zones of France. If not, it would be very strange. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Tension in Vichy</p>
<p>Vichy - Laval's departure and Flandin's entry into the cabinet have created a tense atmosphere in Vichy. The French cabinet held a meeting from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM yesterday and did not issue a communiqué. An hour later, the Council of State was convened again, with strict security. Just before midnight, Laval smiled and walked out of the meeting hall, looking down, carrying a bundle of documents in his hand, and drove away by car. The destination was not announced. It was then learned that Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval had resigned at 10:15 PM. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>French Public Opinion Gaining Strength</p>
<p>London - Agence France-Presse reported that Laval's departure from the Vichy political stage is clear evidence of the increasing strength of French public opinion, which can influence government decisions. The French people's hatred of Laval is growing, so French people at home and abroad support General Pétain's statement that he was dismissed for the sake of national interests. The British army's victory in Africa has made the French people more determined in their hatred of the policy of close cooperation between France and Germany, so those who advocate this policy must leave office. However, Flandin's character does not guarantee the restoration of Anglo-French rapprochement. His appointment may produce unexpected events. However, Flandin is also aware that Dunton's departure was prompted by public opinion, and he may not repeat the same mistakes and hope that the French people can submit to the German system. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Flandin's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Vichy - The new Foreign Minister, Flandin, was born on April 12, 1889. His father once served as the Governor-General of French Tunisia. On May 10, 1914, he was elected as a member of parliament for the Yonne department. He was re-elected in subsequent elections. During the First World War, he enlisted as an air force pilot and participated in major battles, achieving great merit. In 1917, he was transferred to work in the Ministry of Aviation and began to leave the military. Because of his capable work, he was soon promoted to Undersecretary of the Ministry of Aviation and was the first French representative to the International Aviation Committee. In peacetime, he belonged to the left-wing Republican group in the parliament and served as a member of various important subcommittees of the parliament. In 1928 and 1929, he was elected as Vice-President of the parliament. His first appointment as a minister was in the Massal cabinet in 1924, serving as Minister of Commerce. In 1929, he served as Minister of Commerce again in the Tardieu cabinet. The following year, the Tardieu cabinet was reorganized, and Flandin was reappointed. In January 1931, when Laval formed a cabinet, he was appointed Minister of Finance. In February 1932, when Tardieu made a comeback, Flandin continued to hold office. On November 9, 1934, Flandin was first ordered to form a cabinet, and he resigned on May 31, 1935, and was succeeded by Laval as Prime Minister, but he was still invited to serve as a minister without portfolio. In January 1936, the Sarraut cabinet was formed, and he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs until June 4 of that year, when the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, formed a Popular Front cabinet, and he withdrew from the central government until today. During this time, Flandin, although out of office, continued to work for peace, especially during the Munich Conference in September 1938, where he made the greatest contribution.

<h3 id="e5">Coup in the Tragedy of France <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>According to Vichy news yesterday, French President Pétain reorganized the cabinet on the 14th, dismissing Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval and appointing Baudouin and Flandin as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister respectively; and fundamentally abolished the provision in the current draft constitution that the Vice-President is qualified to succeed the President. This is the first cabinet reshuffle since France abandoned the war and made peace. This is a major political upheaval and the most drastic change since the establishment of the totalitarian system. This not only shows the unease in French politics, but also reveals that the difficulties encountered by the Vichy government are increasing due to the increasingly turbulent European situation. Although things cannot be said to be surprising, it is certainly not what the Pétain regime expected when it decided to pay the German demands.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this summer, when France signed an armistice agreement with Germany, the European situation was in extreme chaos. The prestige of the Axis powers was also at its peak, so some people who lacked confidence praised the courage of Pétain and others, who dared to risk great disapproval to save France. Even the Pétain regime itself boasted of seeking a glorious peace at that time. When the terms of the armistice agreement were announced, people had already realized that the victorious country might not necessarily have the virtue of generosity, and the price of France's peace was not only the occupation of two-thirds of the country, the dissolution of the army, and the transfer of weapons, but its future destiny was from the beginning suspended in a state of uncertainty, all awaiting the final outcome of the Anglo-German war. As time went on, France's predicament became more and more apparent. The German army's supplies were vast, the French people were starving everywhere, the colonies were falling apart, and people's hearts were restless. The cooperation negotiations launched by Germany to France in late October became a great difficulty for the Vichy regime. That negotiation, through Laval's travels and the meeting between Hitler and Pétain, although only ended with the establishment of a cooperation agreement in principle, Germany has never stopped trying to invite France to help Germany in the war, and at the same time laid the groundwork for this cabinet reshuffle. This fully proves that France not only failed to preserve its glory, but even failed to achieve peace. The reward for surrendering to the armistice is endless demands and troubles. Reading Pétain's message to the people on October 10, full of sorrow, it is not difficult to imagine the misery and suffering France encountered after surrendering.</p>
<p>Because France was suddenly reduced from a first-class power to a position of being slaughtered and enslaved, the suffering felt by the French people is not comparable to that of emerging countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, or small countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. In addition, Germany and France have been enemies for generations, with deep-rooted prejudices. To suddenly change their psychology to accept German domination and cooperate with Germany is contrary to human nature and difficult to achieve in reality, which further forms a major shadow between the French people and the Vichy government. The faction of the French authorities led by Laval has been constantly arguing to eliminate old grievances and rely on Germany, and even advocating accepting Germany's demands to cede the territories of Alsace and Lorraine in exchange for the realization of "peace." It is no wonder that they are despised and criticized by the general French people. Originally, the foundation of the totalitarian system can only be built by establishing achievements abroad. If it is absolutely centralized internally and only knows humiliation externally, its regime will of course have no possibility of being consolidated. Laval, as a speculative politician who suddenly became powerful, lacks achievements and is not a source of faith. His insistence on surrendering to Germany is based on a very slim hope: according to his argument, only the defeat of Britain can change France's position, so he advocates making any concessions to help Germany. However, it is not known that if Britain really collapses, Germany will do whatever it wants, and France's future position will inevitably become more tragic, and Britain's defeat is still unimaginable. Therefore, when Britain's position is becoming stronger and the Axis' situation is gradually becoming unfavorable, Laval's route is becoming more and more reversed, even if he personally continues to maintain his consistent views. How can he force the French people to blindly follow? In mid-November, when the German army forcibly relocated the French people, the German side said that it was based on the cooperation agreement established during the meeting between Hitler and Laval. The Vichy side resolutely denied it: eventually, the German force had to temporarily stop the forced relocation, which was an exposure of the decline of Laval's political life.</p>
<p>Previously, many people suspected that President Pétain was only Laval's tool, and Laval also had an air of complacency and arrogance: now, it can be proved that this is not the case. At least in some measures in the recent three months, it can be seen that there are fundamental differences between the two, such as their response to the recent Franco-German negotiations. Another example is that after former Foreign Minister Baudouin left office due to a conflict with Laval, the Foreign Minister was concurrently held by Laval, but Baudouin was appointed as Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office and entrusted with Pétain's trust to preside over the youth movement that he valued most, which can be seen as Pétain's layout for launching this coup. In addition, Pétain also imitated the methods of Germany and Italy to carry out the organization of the French stormtroopers. All of this shows that Pétain does have major ambitions outside of Laval's route. However, in any case, today's Vichy regime is ultimately entrusted to the power of the German side and is produced to adapt to the humiliating conditions of the armistice agreement. Unless the European situation is completely changed, it is impossible to fundamentally change its destined tragedy. Looking at this cabinet reshuffle, although Baudouin succeeded as Prime Minister, Flandin, who has always advocated being pro-German and is rumored to have recently received great favor from the German side, was appointed as Foreign Minister. Therefore, its future policies may differ from Laval's in terms of method, but it is impossible to jump out of the humiliating rut of close cooperation with Germany. Therefore, this reorganization of the Vichy regime, in fact, still cannot alleviate its current major difficulties, let alone have any constructive actions. And some French people who are unwilling to give in to humiliation and shame, seeing that Britain's position in the war is becoming stronger and stronger, and has not collapsed rapidly after France, must deeply regret the mistakes in their previous judgment of the future of the war and the failure to stop fighting alongside Britain. This is a painful lesson. At the same time, it is also an increasingly difficult problem for Vichy.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Cooperation Movement Highly Developed in the Provinces of Shanxi and Hebei Guerrilla Zones; 60 Industrial Cooperatives Established in Southern Shanxi; Rapid Progress in Iron Smelting and Cotton Weaving Industries <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – The industrial cooperative movement in the guerrilla zones of Shanxi and Hebei provinces is developing daily. These small-scale production enterprises are not only vital for maintaining the guerrilla war economy but also compensate for the insufficiency of production in metropolitan areas. For example, the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi, which is a crucial strategic stronghold for [guerrilla] warfare, has already established 60 industrial cooperatives. There are also many cooperatives in the Taihang Mountains in eastern Shanxi, and recently, several cooperatives have been established in the border area between Shanxi and Henan. Five officials dispatched by the China Cooperative Association are providing guidance. Furthermore, these cooperatives are located very close to the front lines, so they are highly mobile and can advance and retreat simultaneously with the troops. In terms of the business of each, textile weaving and iron smelting are the most common. For instance, in 22 villages and towns in western Hebei, there are a total of 260 cooperatives, most of which were organized and established within the past eight months. The most important of these is a certain cooperative in Laiyuan City, known for its iron smelting. As for central and southern Hebei, there are also several cooperatives engaged in cotton weaving, which have provided employment for thousands of refugees in disaster areas.

<p>Hanoi – Thai newspapers have published news stating that French troops within Vietnam are preparing to launch a large-scale offensive against Thailand. Well-informed sources here have categorically denied this, saying that such news is purely fabricated. Vietnam has never had any demands on its neighbor, let alone any intention of invading it. Vietnam's actions are limited to expressing that the repeated actions taken by Thai troops against Vietnam recently cannot be excused as errors or attributed to the individual actions of a few soldiers. In short, French troops have never taken provocative actions. All past actions were due to the activities of Thai troops. This has been repeatedly stated by officials, and in fact, it has even been announced that preparations are being made to reopen negotiations with Thailand. So far, this attitude has not changed. In other words, the Vietnamese government is ready to implement the spirit and letter of the non-aggression pact between Vietnam and Thailand. The key is to promptly exchange the ratification documents of this agreement by both sides, and then appoint a committee to demarcate the border line on the Mekong River. Moreover, the Vietnamese government is willing to establish a joint committee to resolve the recent border disputes. However, it must be stated that the prerequisite for implementing the non-aggression pact is that Thailand immediately cease all acts of aggression. If that happens, then the Vietnamese government will also cease retaliation. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – Zhou Qigang, Deputy Minister of the Overseas Department of the Kuomintang, recently stated that overseas Chinese investment is no longer a theoretical issue but a factual one. Since the outbreak of the European War, especially after Japan's aggressive southward advance, overseas Chinese urgently hope to invest in the motherland. Last year, during the anti-Chinese tide in Siam, overseas Chinese remitted more than 300,000 yuan to Kunming, but unfortunately, it was not used well. In the future, in addition to encouraging individual investments by overseas Chinese, there should be sound organizations to guide them. Overseas Chinese investment should be promoted by the government, but not through political methods, to avoid the problem of "following orders blindly." I proposed convening an overseas Chinese economic conference in the 23rd year [of the Republic, 1934], which was approved by the Executive Yuan, but it did not materialize due to the outbreak of war and repeated relocation of the government. I still intend to promote its realization so that overseas Chinese capital can be fully utilized to promote the construction of the motherland. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Cairo – It is reported that the rapidly advancing British desert corps completely expelled the defeated Italian troops from Egypt to Libya last night, while British aircraft and warships continuously caused fires and ruins on the main bases of the Italian forces. The latest news from the Egyptian-Libyan border states that the collapse of the Italian forces seems to be increasing with time. It is claimed that several thousand more Italian troops have fled in panic into the narrow passage between Sollum and Bardia, which is often bombed, and have become prisoners or have surrendered. Officials say that the British army's achievements to date include defeating eight Italian divisions, totaling 120,000 men, with five more broken Italian divisions being pursued by the British army. The news from the Sollum and Bardia area states that the situation there is chaotic, like hell. British warships off the coast continuously bombarded large groups of defeated Italian troops with cannons.

It is estimated that there are now 30,000 prisoners. The Italian army is trying hard to prevent the British army from advancing straight in, but the British army's morale is extremely high, so this task will be very difficult for the Italian army. The British army's progress is so rapid that the latest information received by the rear often does not reflect the most recent battles on the front lines. The campaign began only six days ago, and the British army has already deeply reached the border between Egypt and Libya, which shows the ferocity of the British westward advance.

<p>New York - Former Baroness of Sherbrooke, Mrs. Stevenson, a renowned female sculptor and a close friend of the Belgian royal family, told the International News Service yesterday that King Leopold of Belgium is now actually imprisoned by the Nazis at his summer retreat in Segnon, 100 miles from Brussels. Mrs. Stevenson also stated that Nazi troops have been heavily guarding the palace, and no one is allowed to see the King without a special pass from the German governor. According to Mrs. Stevenson, King Leopold has been forgotten by the world since he issued the historic order to surrender to the German forces. He now lives in the palace with his mother and his brother, Prince Charles. Rumors have it that Hitler has dispatched Leopold as a special envoy to the Vatican to present the German side's peace proposals. The former Baroness refuted this and said that the rumor was completely fabricated and may be a German propaganda tactic to alienate the King from his people and make them think that the King has betrayed them to the Nazis.

<p>Vichy - A spokesman for the French government declared that France will protect its overseas territories by force. Regarding Martinique Island in the Americas, which currently has no Germans or Italians and is not in danger of being annexed by the Axis powers, the French government does not believe that the United States will seize the island by force. However, if this were to happen, the United States would inevitably violate the resolutions of the Pan-American Conference in Cuba. Martinique is now completely under French rule, and if anything happens, France will have no choice but to resist. Furthermore, French Head of State Pétain appointed Malini Nicolas as the new Governor of Martinique yesterday. (United Press, 15th)</p>

<p>Paris - Former French Member of Parliament, Thorio, generally regarded as a tough politician, told a United Press reporter in his fifth-floor office yesterday on his 42nd birthday that he believes the United States will not participate in the European war. The main reason for the U.S. non-participation is Japan. Thorio said, "I think the United States is already hesitant about participating in the European war because it fears that participation will simultaneously trigger wars in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The recent German-Italian-Japanese agreement has further strengthened this belief in the United States. I also believe that the lessons learned by France and Britain have made the American people feel that maintaining peace is the right thing to do, and the United States itself is not prepared. This can be seen from the fact that the United States cannot provide France with aircraft assistance." Thorio also said that even if Roosevelt personally tends to uphold anti-totalitarianism, President Roosevelt has to advocate anti-war because of the strong anti-war sentiment of the American people. Regarding the recent attitude of the United States towards France in the war, Thorio made a strict criticism of the so-called US promise to aid France once the war occurred. Thorio said, "France's failure is not only military but also political. The first consequence seen was the destruction of French democracy and the Third Republic. This war could have been avoided, but the French democrats were too fond of war, and this was the consequence. In addition, the French democrats had a great delusion that the democratic countries of the world would be able to help them. These people also thought that the British democrats would do their best to send troops to the European continent to fight, but this hope did not materialize. These people also believed that the American democrats would unite with France, and the first step would be to provide France with material assistance, and the second step would be to help France with manpower. Why was this fact not realized? I think you (referring to the United Press reporter) know more than I do. You must know that the promises in Roosevelt's speech have not been realized in fact. The French democrats do not believe that the Soviet Union can help them in the same way, but the Soviet Union's aid has not been realized either. Because of this, the French democrats feel that they are completely isolated. This is the harm caused by their excessive rashness and delusion of the unity of democratic countries." Thorio also said that democracy cannot represent the real French people, but it is just a political term for defending the interests of financial oligarchs, international economics (which can be said to be Jewish economics), and large capitalists, and it is a concept that all Europeans have long opposed. The French democrats speak of Britain, the Soviet Union, and even the United States, but never mention France. This is because France has been breeding a revolution for many years. This founder of the French People's Party also said that most French people do not believe in war, and when the French took up arms to fight, their resentment towards their own government was almost the same as their resentment towards Germany. Thorio also believes that even if this war had started in October 1939 instead of May 1940, the result would have been the same. Thorio's body is very burly, and most of the space in his small room seems to be occupied by his body. Thorio's voice was loud when he spoke, and his upper and lower jaws moved rapidly. Thorio was initially a Communist member, and shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany, Thorio accepted totalitarianism and became a fierce anti-Communist. Thorio also described his plan to regenerate France, implying in his words that he himself was the person to implement this plan. In the past, Briand also said, "In the future, Thorio may lead France." Thorio said that he believes in a combined state, that is, all the French people are united to form a classless dictatorship of a "great society." This "great society" is based on fraternity and advocates the establishment of a government that is in harmony with the powers that control the European peninsula. Thorio's totalitarian plan also advocates the exclusion of Jews and advocates sending Jews to Africa and other places to form their own country. (United Press, 15th)</p>

<p>Washington - The plan announced by US Defense Committee member Knudsen that US military production should be placed on a war footing is very welcome to many people here. The slow pace of current military production is often discussed, and the public is quite hopeful that President Roosevelt will do something to promote it. It is said that the real reason for the President's tour of the Caribbean is to personally consider the situation and then make major decisions. Knudsen is a recognized expert in the study of military production, and his remarks can make the public accept the decisions that the President is about to announce. Knudsen told a group of important industrialists the day before yesterday about the importance of accelerating the production of defense goods, saying that US aircraft production is 30% behind the schedule set in July, and that the closing of factories on Sundays would make the production schedule fail.

<p>United States Rushes to Build Aircraft and Tanks</p>
<p>Washington Aviation News According to official announcements, since July 1 of this year, the various military supplies ordered by the Department of the Army have exceeded 4.5 billion US dollars, accounting for more than 71% of the national defense expenditures passed by both houses of Congress. In the Department of the Navy, only slightly more than 1 billion US dollars have been ordered. Among the military supplies ordered by the Department of the Army, there are as many as 6,000 tanks alone, which are now being rushed to build by various corridors. As for aircraft, the Department of the Army has ordered a total of 18,641 aircraft, and the Department of the Navy has also ordered 7,000 aircraft. Up to now, the expenditures incurred by a total of 26 gunpowder factories, shell factories, aircraft manufacturing factories, and other military factories have reached 750 million US dollars. In addition, there are hundreds of factories manufacturing military uniforms, military blankets, and other supplies, which are now stepping up their construction to supply the needs of the army of 2 million personnel. As for the army barracks currently under construction, it is expected that 90% will be completed by January 1 of next year. There are also 31 large-scale barracks, which are used to train 1.5 million new recruits, which are expected to be completed by June next year. In short, the date on which the various military supplies ordered according to the national defense plan will be delivered is a military secret, and the relevant parties are absolutely secretive. Official sources only said that the manufacturing process in each department cannot reach the predetermined speed until the summer of next year. (Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Reasons for the Mid-Way Split between Pétain and Laval <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In June and July, Pétain negotiated an armistice with Germany and Italy on the outside, and abolished democracy and established a dictatorship on the inside. He was originally singing a "double act" with Laval. Before several months had passed, news came that they split mid-way. Where does the reason lie? The following is a translated transcript of a long-distance telephone report sent on the 2nd of last month by the New York Times correspondent in the capital of Switzerland, for reference:</p>
<p>According to a certain well-known French anti-British politician who recently traveled from Vichy to Switzerland for sightseeing, the faction in the French government that hoped for British defeat has gradually lost its influence, while the personal prestige of Head of State Pétain is rising rapidly. The road to the resumption of peace in Europe is distant and full of thorns. Britain's resistance has lasted a long time and seems to be getting stronger and stronger. The French anti-British elements are therefore full of suspicion, and pro-British sentiments are gradually overflowing.</p>
<p>The Vichy government's reconstruction and construction plan must rely on Germany's assistance. In addition to removing dissidents and purging the various causes of the war, as for the attitude of the Italian government, it still insists, but can this plan be completed? It insists on its territorial demands on France. In recent days, the tone of the newspapers of the Axis countries has also echoed each other, causing great disappointment to the Vichy government. It is heard that in the face of such a change in the situation, even Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Laval finds it difficult to justify himself to his government colleagues. Laval recently stated in Paris his determination to eliminate "foreign interference," meaning that he would use all his strength to eliminate British propaganda in France and prevent the influence of those who sympathize with General de Gaulle from spreading any further. In order to promote this policy, Laval hoped that Germany would sincerely accept French "cooperation" and support France's opposition to Italian territorial demands.</p>
<p>In addition, Laval was heard to have pressured Head of State Pétain to accept the demands of the Axis powers, ceding several naval bases in the Mediterranean to Germany and Italy, and even willing to supply part of the French navy to Germany and Italy to attack Britain. However, General Pétain firmly advocated maintaining "glorious neutrality" towards Britain and consistently rejected this proposal.</p>
<p>Currently, rumors are spreading in the unoccupied areas of France, spare no effort, and efforts to refute rumors and correct them are also overwhelming. But as long as General Pétain is in power, his attitude will not change for a day, so it seems that it can be concluded. Pétain was reportedly extremely indignant about the terms of the "peace agreement" accepted by Laval. In short, no matter how Pétain fails in other aspects, he will never allow the French army to help the enemy attack Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Review of Shanghai Rice Prices <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Li Deming</p>
<p>April: 46.00 yuan</p>
<p>May: 41.00 yuan</p>
<p>June: 66.25 yuan</p>
<p>July: 68.43 yuan</p>
<p>August: 65.75 yuan</p>
<p>September: 75.62 yuan</p>
<p>October: 85.50 yuan</p>
<p>November: 87.00 yuan</p>
<p>Based on the above table, we can see that before 1937, the highest rice price was 12.50 yuan in 1934. After the "August 13" Incident in 1937, the rice price rose slightly, but until 1939, the price per picul was only 24.62 yuan. By this year, the situation has changed drastically. The average rice price rose step by step from 40 yuan in January to 87 yuan by November. On the 4th of this month, the price of white rice even rose to 106 yuan, but it has recently fallen back slightly. Even so, it still cannot but make people shudder!</p>
<h3 id="e46">Reasons for Today's Rice Price Increase in Shanghai <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is located on the Yangtze River's southern delta, its fertile land earning it the title of the "Land of Fish and Rice" in Jiangnan. Before "August 13th," Shanghai's rice supply was extremely abundant, with minimal reliance on foreign sources. Annual imports rarely exceeded 300,000 to 400,000 metric tons. After "August 13th," foreign rice imports saw a slight increase, but the majority was still supplied domestically. The following shows the amount of foreign rice imported during the three years from 1937 to 1939:</p>
<p>1937 307,860 metric tons</p>
<p>1938 644,930 metric tons</p>
<p>1939 457,650 metric tons</p>
<p>Of the above three years of foreign rice imports, 1938 was the highest, yet it was only 644,930 metric tons. Considering last year, it was only 457,650 metric tons, not significantly different from pre-war levels. However, this year, the situation has drastically changed, with foreign rice imports reaching record highs. The following details the foreign rice imports from January to October of this year:</p>
<p>Of the above three years of foreign rice imports, 1938 was the highest, yet it was only 644,930 metric tons. Considering last year, it was only 457,650 metric tons, not significantly different from pre-war levels. However, this year, the situation has drastically changed, with foreign rice imports reaching record highs. The following details the foreign rice imports from January to October of this year:</p>
<p>January 1940 370,140 metric tons</p>
<p>February 307,624 metric tons</p>
<p>March 625,444 metric tons</p>
<p>April 317,270 metric tons</p>
<p>May 54,132 metric tons</p>
<p>June 200,659 metric tons</p>
<p>July 485,152 metric tons</p>
<p>August 50,350 metric tons</p>
<p>September 137,810 metric tons</p>
<p>October 577,411 metric tons</p>
<p>Total 3,779,622 metric tons</p>
<p>These figures are definitely not complete, as underreporting is a common tactic among merchants. However, even based on the above numbers, excluding May, September, and October, the imports for months such as March, July, and August exceed the total imports for the entire last year. Other months like January, February, April, June, and October are not far behind last year's total imports. In total, since October of this year, the total foreign rice imports have reached 3,779,622 metric tons, nearly twelve times that of 1937, five times that of 1938, and seven times that of 1939. Therefore, even if the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai has decreased, it is more than offset. Shanghai's food supply and demand can be considered completely problem-free. As for why domestic rice shipments to Shanghai have decreased, the reason can be summarized in one sentence: the Japanese monopolization of sources.</p>
<p>Japan's food supply has always been insufficient. Since the war against China began, the need for food has surged due to military requirements. On the other hand, due to the conscription of farmers, requisitioning of draft horses, and shortage of fertilizers, productivity has plummeted. Last year, Japan's agricultural product income had already decreased, causing a nationwide rice shortage and a rather serious problem. Their only hope was for a bumper harvest this year to compensate, but unexpectedly, Japan's mainland and Korea were hit by drought, leading to another poor rice harvest. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year's rice production totaled 310,500,000 "斗" (a traditional Chinese unit of dry volume), falling far short of the Japanese target of 355,000,000 "斗," and even compared to the average production of 330,000,000 "斗" over the past four years, it is still 19,500,000 "斗" short. Therefore, Japan is now vigorously reducing rice consumption, even mixing wheat into rice for food. However, Japan's wheat harvest this year is also far worse than last year, so this approach still cannot solve even a fraction of Japan's food crisis. As a result, they have to turn their attention abroad. According to the Far Eastern Survey on October 10th, from December 1939 to March 1940, Japan purchased a total of 2,600,000 metric tons of rice from the countries of the Indochinese Peninsula, accounting for about 6% of Japan's total imports. Japan is now purchasing such a large amount of rice from abroad, which inevitably requires the use of its foreign exchange reserves. However, since the war against China began, military spending has been enormous, and foreign exchange reserves have long been depleted—how can they constantly have huge sums to purchase food from abroad? Therefore, they are using their military power in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to forcibly purchase rice with unprepared military scrip and transport it to Japan. According to statistics, in the past ten months, as much as 7,000,000 metric tons of rice have been shipped from China to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Reasons for the Rise in Rice Prices in Shanghai <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, while we cannot say that the rise in rice prices in Shanghai is completely unrelated to this, the main reason is definitely not this.</p>
<p>How much rice is currently in stock in Shanghai is the most concerning issue for the people of Shanghai today, but reports from all sides vary due to their different perspectives. Rice shops deliberately underreport, claiming that Shanghai has only about 400,000 "石" (another traditional Chinese unit of dry volume) of rice in stock, causing people to panic, facilitating their manipulation and hoarding for profit. Administrative authorities and media outlets, on the other hand, tend to overreport, exaggerating and claiming that Shanghai has more than 4 million "石" of rice, hoping to stabilize public sentiment and prevent speculative rice merchants from using their tricks.</p>
<p>In reality, according to what was mentioned in the first section of this article, the total amount of foreign rice imported from January to October this year was indeed more than 3.5 million metric tons. If divided equally over ten months, the monthly import of foreign rice is indeed 320,000 metric tons, roughly 430,000 "石." The monthly consumption of rice in this city is 11,000 "石." Since the surge in rice prices, the common people have mostly been eating porridge or substituting with coarse grains and other substitutes. Therefore, in terms of population, it is actually less than 11,000 "石." For the sake of argument, let's assume it's 11,000 "石." That means that out of the 430,000 "石" each month, after consumption, there is a net surplus of 100,000 "石." Calculated over ten months, the total net surplus should be 1 million "石." Furthermore, assuming that the net surplus in November is also 100,000 "石," then Shanghai's current rice reserves total 1.1 million "石," enough to supply the entire population of Shanghai for more than three months. However, in Shanghai, it is rare to have a day with 1 million "石" of rice in stock, yet rice prices were stable then. Now, despite having unprecedented huge reserves, rice prices have suddenly skyrocketed. This is obviously due to rice profiteers blinded by greed, manipulating and hoarding for profit. And among them are many wealthy merchants. Therefore, "Until Qing Jiao is gone, the troubles of Lu will not end."</p>
<h3 id="e48">Recent Labor-Management Disputes in Shanghai <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>What are labor-management disputes? Labor-management disputes refer to disputes arising between employers and workers over the maintenance or modification of employment conditions. In such disputes, in order to implement individual or collective demands, methods other than ceasing work are used, and peaceful compromise is sought to resolve the issue. In short, labor-management disputes are conflicts of will between labor and management that have not reached the point of rupture. Formally and qualitatively, they are distinctly different from strikes and work stoppages, as strikes and work stoppages require the cessation of work to achieve their goals. In this light, labor-management disputes are the prelude to strikes and work stoppages, as well as the cause of them. Labor-management disputes are by no means a local problem; they have a situation where one hair can affect the whole body. Looking inside the wrapping of labor-management disputes, its occurrence is more often than not inseparable from economic causes. Labor-management disputes rarely occur during periods of industrial decline; instead, they flourish after industrial recovery. The reason is that rising prices and low real wages lead to conflicts of interest between labor and management. Therefore, due to rising prices and increased living expenses, the purchasing power of original wages gradually declines, making life difficult. Therefore, workers must demand wage increases from employers for the sake of survival. At the same time, the employer's economic situation may also improve the treatment of its employees. If they are reluctant to give in, labor-management disputes are inevitable.</p>

<p>Causes and Analysis of Disputes</p>
<p>In 1937, a total of 136 labor-management dispute cases occurred, which is the lowest number of dispute cases since 1928. The reasons for this sharp decrease in cases that year can be explained from two aspects. First, the national crisis was severe. Since the second half of 1936, the industrial and commercial sectors suddenly showed a flourishing atmosphere, and labor unrest events changed rapidly, with strikes and work stoppages becoming unstoppable, making the relatively milder disputes insignificant in comparison. Second, with the outbreak of the "August 13th" Incident, Shanghai's industrial heartland was reduced to ashes. During the war of resistance, labor and management endured and lived in peace, so naturally, no dispute events occurred. From August 1937 to the end of the year, only six cases occurred, including three in August (one from before the war), one in September, none in October and November, and two in December. On the other hand, judging from the number of employees and factories involved, the seriousness of the dispute cases in 1937 was greater than in 1936. A total of 1,147 factories and 81,983 employees were involved, which is a higher number than since 1933. This may indicate that during the seven months of 1937, in the context of labor unrest, although not many dispute cases occurred, the cases that did occur had a wider scope of involvement.</p>
<p>The most important causes of labor-management disputes are employment, dismissal, wages, benefits, and collective agreements. In the statistical figures for 1937, there were slight changes in the disputes caused by these incidents, as described below:</p>
<p>First, employment and dismissal have been the main causes of labor-management disputes over the years. Since 1928, the annual average accounted for 65.35% of all cases. Although it was still the top cause in 1937, the percentage of cases decreased sharply to 48.53%. Generally, because this year was a time of industrial and commercial recovery, business was improving, so dismissals naturally did not occur frequently. Among the details under the employment and dismissal category, the average annual number of cases where labor opposed dismissal accounted for 50.68%, but it decreased to 36.76% in 1937. Cases involving business closures decreased from 10.48% to 6.62%.</p>
<p>Second, wage cases in 1937 did not differ much from previous years, accounting for 18.38%.</p>
<p>Third, benefit cases increased the most, accounting for 19.12%, leaping above wage cases. In this year, most factories showed surplus profits, so in addition to disputes over wages, many issues arose regarding improving benefits, bonuses, rewards, promotions, and other related matters. Therefore, benefits became the second most important cause in 1937, second only to employment and dismissal.</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding the implementation of collective agreements, almost no cases occurred after 1933. However, there were four cases in 1937, perhaps because as industry and commerce gradually recovered, some unresolved or delayed labor-management agreements from the past were brought up again. This is an overview of the causes of disputes in 1937.</p>
<p>Next, regarding 1938, there were 27 dispute cases, involving 74 factories and just over 20,000 employees. During the period of labor unrest, the number of factories involved in a year reached more than 4,000, and the number of people reached more than 130,000. The period of the war of resistance cannot be compared to ordinary times.</p>
<p>In the 27 cases in 1938, the issue of employment or dismissal was the most common, with 17 cases. Among them, labor opposed the dismissal of workers in six cases, dismissals due to business closures in six cases, and labor demanded the employment of workers in five cases. Five cases were due to benefit issues, including two cases requesting the issuance of maintenance fees and bonuses. Two cases were due to wage issues, both requesting wage increases.</p>
<p>Analyzing the causes of the disputes, in the 112 dispute cases in 1938, 59 cases were due to wages, accounting for 52.68% of the total, and 31 cases were due to employment or dismissal, accounting for 27.68% of the total. In 1937, there were a total of 100 wage dispute cases, accounting for 33.67% of the total, and 54 employment or dismissal dispute cases, accounting for 18.18% of the total. Therefore, although the situation regarding these two causes of disputes in 1938 was similar to previous years, the trend of concentration was more pronounced than in 1937. By 1939, which was the third year of the war of resistance, Shanghai's population had surged, and industry and commerce had gradually recovered. In addition, foreign exchange rates repeatedly collapsed between June and July, merchants manipulated and hoarded for profit, and prices rose uncontrollably. Industrial and commercial enterprises all made significant profits, while the living conditions of the laboring class became extremely difficult. Disputes over wages and subsidies became inevitable, and the number of strikes and disputes increased.</p>
<p>In 1939, there were 121 strike events, with 74 occurring from July to December, showing the impact of the high cost of living in the second half of the year. A total of 433 factories and 33,433 employees were involved.</p>
<p>Since the cause of labor-management disputes lies in the high cost of living, increases in wages and demands for subsidies and benefits are the main causes of strike events. There were 59 cases regarding labor's request for wage increases, accounting for 48.76% of the total number of cases, which is higher than the average of 27.7% from 1918 to 1938. There were 14 cases requesting improved benefits, including requests for rice subsidies, accounting for 11.57%, which is much higher than the averages of 1.88% and 1.09% from 1918 to 1938. The causes of strikes are concentrated on issues of compensation, with no other complications, which can be seen from this. There were 20 cases regarding employment and dismissal, accounting for 16.52%, compared to the average of only 20.7% in previous years.</p>
<p>In 1939, there were 59 dispute cases that did not lead to strikes or work stoppages, involving 788 factories and 31,073 employees. The cause of the disputes was most frequently related to benefits, with 23 cases, followed by wages with 18 cases. The total losses suffered due to strikes throughout the year amounted to 659,278.52 yuan, with wages accounting for 433,471.33 yuan. Among the 121 strike cases, the most common involved only one factory, accounting for 94.21%. The most common number of employees involved was between 101 and 1,000, accounting for 47.93%. The duration of the strikes was generally between two and ten days, accounting for 51.24%.</p>
<p>As for the labor-management disputes in 1940, the major cases included the strikes by British-owned public bus and tram workers and French-owned tram and bus workers, the seriousness of which was unprecedented in previous years. The details of the public sentiment will be described in another article.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The major labor-management disputes in Shanghai over the past three years of the war of resistance have been described above. Due to the hardship of living conditions, the increase in labor-management disputes seems inevitable. However, we must recognize how our lives have become difficult and who has bestowed this upon us. If we were not invaded, our lives would not be so difficult! Therefore, to stabilize our lives, we must strive for final victory. And in the event of a dispute, we should take the overall situation into consideration and be vigilant against infiltration by evil forces. This is something that both labor and management should pay close attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Financial Review <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>— December 14th —</p>
<p>Japan to Change Currency System</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo reports that because the Bank of Japan is issuing an extremely large amount of paper money daily, the Ministry of Finance will submit a law to the next session of the Diet to amend the Bank of Japan's paper money issuance system. According to the report, although the content is very simple, two points are very clear: (1) Possible regulations, based on the French method from 1870 to 1928, regarding the maximum amount of issuance at the end of each year; (2) Establishment of a total reserve, which includes gold and silver coins, gold and silver bars, government securities, and commercial securities. Whether the Bank of Japan's paper money issuance system will actually be changed in such a magical way cannot be confirmed until the Japanese Diet formally amends it. However, the inability to display Japan's wartime financial finances is undeniable.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's issuance reserve system has always been divided into cash reserves and guarantee reserves. The cash reserve includes gold and silver coins and gold and silver bars, while the guarantee reserve includes four categories: public bonds, government securities, securities, and notes. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in August 1937, the government securities item in the guarantee reserve was no longer published, and was in fact hidden under other guarantee items. However, based on a close observation of the reserve contents published by the Bank of Japan since July 1937, the cash reserve was increased to a paper figure of 800 million yuan due to the evaluation of gold, and then reduced to a nominal 500 million yuan. In terms of guarantee reserves, the increase in securities and notes was more than doubled after three years, and public bonds expanded with the increase in the amount issued. Therefore, as far as the published statistics of Japanese currency are concerned, cash and guarantee reserves have long existed in name only, becoming a total public bond reserve. It does not need to be changed to a total reserve fund in the future to be so.</p>
<p>As for saying that the maximum amount of issuance at the end of each year may be stipulated in accordance with the French method, it is also the same way of recognizing the facts. After the war, the guaranteed reserve was expanded again and again from 120 million yen to 220 million yen, and the extra-limit guarantee reserve had already exceeded 100 million yen. Today, the so-called possible regulations for the highest amount of issuance each year will not only expand the issuance of guaranteed reserves, but in fact will try to maximize the amount of issuance. Please take the French method reported in the telegram as an example to illustrate: According to the French Bank of France, the maximum limit for the amount of paper money issued since 1870 has been set by law. Within the limit, the bank is free to adopt a guarantee reserve or even no reserve for the redemption-free paper money issued. If paper money is issued in excess of the statutory maximum limit, a cash reserve is required. Now, because Japan has no cash reserves, it has no choice but to recognize the fact that it will use the French method to stipulate a maximum issuance amount each year with a full guarantee reserve system, which is what I discussed in the past. (Please refer to the Financial Review of November 16, "The Future of Bank of Japan's Issuance")</p>

<p>Western shrimp tails have been affected by the dumping of Eastern goods, and transactions have been sluggish. It was found that the previous market Xiangshan shrimp tail opened at 405 yuan. Yesterday, there were continued sales openings, with the deal being 360 yuan to 340 yuan. The front and rear must have a setback of about fifty-sixty.

<p>——Ordinary Tie Wire——</p>
<p>Ordinary white iron has recently been in short supply from the factory, and raw materials are also expensive. Therefore, industry insiders have a very firm outlook. The exchange rate has risen but not fallen. Yesterday, the 6-foot goods were still ordinary, while the 7-foot fancy varieties rose by another 2 corners. Yesterday's prices were, for example, 6-foot goods were sold for 8 yuan 3 corners, and 7-foot goods opened at 9 yuan 5 corners.</p>
<p>Tie wire, because the factory in this street has not expanded its capacity, and the outlet to the outside is also rare, so the market situation is not lively, and industry insiders also feel ordinary. The market price has not changed from before, whether good or bad. Yesterday's transactions in the city were only a little over a hundred dan. Each dan was sold for 55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Recent Trends in Polish Wool Fabric <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Polish wool fabric has occupied a considerable position in the wool fabric market over the years. It is said that the autumn and winter seasons are more fashionable, because its products are mostly thick goods, such as overcoat fabric, blurred fabric, Melton, and plain thick fabric. Plain thick fabric accounts for a greater advantage, having a heroic appearance that monopolizes the entire city. This is because other countries' products have never been able to be affordable, cheap, special, and beautiful. However, summer goods and thin wool fabrics are still difficult to compete with products from other countries, so the foreign firms that operate Polish wool fabrics also rely only on goods from the autumn and winter seasons. In general, the recent trend of Polish wool fabric is mostly showing a firm and rising trend. According to the trend, after Poland was captured by Germany after the European War, German shipping routes were mostly blockaded by the United Kingdom, resulting in the disappearance of shipments. What is currently being traded in the market is half of the previous inventory and half from transshipments from Singapore and Hong Kong. However, supply and demand are still balanced, because the foreign trade route cannot be loaded, and the ones sold are the lone island. Currently, the original Polish plain thick fabric, the first-grade thick goods, are all sold for 32-33 yuan, the second-grade for 27-28 yuan, the third-grade for 23-24 yuan, the fourth-grade thin fabric plain fabric for 18 yuan, the fifth-grade for 16.5 yuan, Melton for 14 yuan, the first-grade blurred fabric for 13 yuan, the second-grade for 11.5 yuan, the first-grade overcoat fabric for 46 yuan, the second-grade for 38 yuan, the third-grade for 34 yuan, the fourth-grade for 23-25 yuan, the fifth-grade for 20 yuan, and the sixth-grade for 14 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to the decline in dried longans coinciding with the fall in chemical goods, the miscellaneous goods market followed suit and became sluggish. Additionally, due to certain reasons, the delivery of goods was unusually slow, further softening the market. Recently, negotiations were held between the trading houses to determine the upper-end price for dried longans, but due to excessive price differences, the cargo owners have been telegraphed for their opinions before a final decision can be made, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Issue of Vehicle Licenses in Western Shanghai: The Public Works Department Closely Monitors the Situation, Engages in Negotiations with the Japanese for Careful Handling; Although Obstacles Have Been Removed, Restrictions Remain Strict <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Since the lifting of the blockade in the western Shanghai area the day before yesterday, there has been no change in the situation as of yesterday. However, a large number of notices suddenly appeared on the walls along Yuyuan Road and Great West Road yesterday, announcing that vehicles must pay taxes and obtain licenses. This matter is noteworthy. Although Zhuanbang and other areas have been opened, restrictions remain, and some obstacles have not yet been removed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Openly Posting Notices Demanding Tax Collection</p>
<p>Yesterday, "Notices" jointly issued by the "Public Works Bureau, Western Shanghai Vehicle Affairs Branch" and the "Finance Bureau, Western Shanghai Tax Collection Office" suddenly appeared on the walls along Yuyuan Road, Great West Road, and Yidingpan Road. The content roughly stated: "All vehicles passing through this area, whether automobiles, rickshaws, bicycles, horse-drawn carriages, etc., whether for business or private use, must register at No. 92, Lane, opposite Keen Road on Jessfield Road, and then pay vehicle taxes and obtain licenses at this tax collection office in order to comply with regulations. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to travel freely within this area. We now earnestly warn you not to wait and see any longer," and so on. These notices were written in ink with a red seal. However, they did not specify the deadline or the amount of vehicle tax. Nevertheless, they have aroused great concern from all sectors of society, who generally believe that this is an attempt by a certain party to further profit from the opportunity. In addition to submitting a protest to the Japanese side, the concession authorities are now carefully and strictly dealing with the matter. Yesterday, within the area, rickshaws were restricted and could not enter without a "license." Other business automobiles, private automobiles, and bicycles were not yet subject to any obstacles.</p>
<p>How Can Rickshaw Pullers Bear the Burden?</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the municipal police in the Western Shanghai area are prohibiting rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession who have not "registered" with a certain party and paid the "permit" fee from operating in the area. The Public Concession authorities are currently investigating this "ban." Meanwhile, yesterday (the 14th), authoritative sources reported that although the blockade of the Western Shanghai area has been lifted, the municipal police continue to collect "permit fees" from rickshaw pullers entering the extra-settlement roads. According to a "senior official" of the "Police Bureau" in Western Shanghai, although Western Shanghai has been opened and Public Concession buses are also allowed to enter, the "Regulations for Rickshaw Permits in China" must be implemented. The "permit fee" for each rickshaw is 1.25 yuan per month, plus a "registration fee" of 2.19 yuan. Rickshaws with only Public Concession permits and without "permits" issued by the "Chinese authorities" are not allowed to enter the following locations: 1. South of the Robert Dollar Road, Yinghua Lane; 2. The intersection of Connaught Road and Yanping Road; 3. The intersection of Jessfield Road and Edinburgh Road; 4. The intersection of Hart Road and Dijon Road. In the past few days, municipal police have stopped rickshaws near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Jessfield Road and advised rickshaw pullers to obtain "Chinese permits" from the "Western Shanghai Transportation Office" on Keen Road.</p>
<p>Two Blockades on Great West Road</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Yuyuan Road intersection west of the Paramount Hotel, two Japanese military police and seven or eight municipal police were stationed with weapons, monitoring passing vehicles. At the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Heping Road, there were only some municipal police. The obstacles at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Great West Road and at the intersection of Yidingpan Road at the southern end of Great West Road have not yet been removed and remain completely blocked. It is unknown when they will be opened. The intention behind the Japanese side's continued blockade of the above locations is also unknown, as it serves no practical purpose. In addition, all roads in Western Shanghai have returned to their original state, and all shops have reopened. However, Zhuanbang on Yidingpan Road, which the Japanese side considers a hideout for "terrorists," is under a semi-blockade. Two Japanese military police are stationed outside the wooden gate, armed and monitoring residents entering and exiting, along with six or seven municipal police conducting inspections. A notice from the "Yuguang Village Military Police Team" is posted on the wall, stating that "the hours for entering and exiting Zhuanbang are limited to 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM for residents exiting and 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM for residents entering; 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM for bringing in goods, and 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM for bringing out goods. All goods brought in or out must be registered and approved before a permit is issued." In addition, Yongxing Lane at the southern end of Zhuanbang has not been opened. At 4:30 PM yesterday, reporters personally saw three Japanese military police inspecting the area with wooden-shell pistols. The other lanes and alleys along Yidingpan Road, such as Zaijia Lane, are allowed to be entered and exited, but are also subject to strict restrictions. Japanese military police are constantly patrolling Yidingpan Road.</p>
<p>Public Buses Not Fully Restored</p>
<p>Yesterday, British-owned public buses had not yet returned to their state before September 30th. Only a portion of Route 1 single-deck buses were running between Jing'an Temple and Zhaofeng Garden. Route 9 terminated at Jing'an Temple, with no buses entering Yuyuan Road. Only half of Route 2 was running between Jing'an Temple and Anhe Temple Road. Therefore, Route 1 and Route 2 both sold tickets in two sections, with Jing'an Temple as the transfer station. However, British-owned Route 20 trolleybuses have returned to their original state, running directly to Zhaofeng Garden. Route 14 buses terminated at Dijon Road on Great West Road due to the closure of the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Great West Road. It is said that all British-owned public bus routes will be restored to their state before September 30th within the day. As yesterday was the second day of the opening, the company authorities adopted this cautious approach.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Norwegian Merchant Ships: Forbidden to be Leased to Japan; Leases in Effect Will Be Honored Until Expiration <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to recent news obtained by the British shipping industry, a large number of Norwegian merchant ships operate in the Far East. In the future, British and Norwegian shipping will cooperate. Norwegian shipping authorities in London have issued an order prohibiting Norwegian merchant ships from being leased to Japan. Previously leased Norwegian ships will not be allowed to renew their leases upon expiration. In this way, with the cooperation of British and Norwegian shipping and Japan's current shortage of merchant ships, Japan will not only find it difficult to compete with British shipping companies, but will also suffer a significant blow. Under the current circumstances, it is also unlikely that Japan will be able to lease American and Panamanian merchant ships.</p>

<p>When the Legal Tender (Fabi) was implemented, the Ministry of Finance received banknotes from eight banks – Siming, Zhejiang Xingye, China Reclamation, Zhongnan, China Agricultural &amp; Industrial, China General Commercial, etc. – which had been taken over by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and stored in various local bank treasuries. Now, due to a shortage of Fabi, transportation difficulties, and high printing costs, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have requested that these banknotes be released for circulation and that they be responsible for their redemption in order to meet the needs and reduce wastage. After review, this is deemed feasible and should be approved. All public and private payments should accept them without discrimination in order to facilitate finance.</p>

<p>The children of Jewish refugees residing in London had previously decided to leave the UK for Shanghai due to repeated bombings of London. According to the Far Eastern Jewish Propaganda Bureau, this plan has now been suspended due to unrest at sea, a lack of ships, and extremely precarious living conditions for Jewish refugees in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Legal Tender Stabilization Fund: Increased by 120 Million; Secured with the Support of the UK and the US; The Only Way to Prevent Exchange Rate Manipulation is to Impose an Embargo on Japan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Following the US loan of 100 million US dollars to China, the UK also loaned 10 million pounds to China. Both the US and UK loans stipulated that half would be used for the Legal Tender (Fabi) stabilization fund and half for China to purchase goods. Half of the US loan, 50 million US dollars, is equivalent to 850 million Fabi based on the open market exchange rate. Half of the UK loan is also equivalent to 300 million Fabi. The UK and US loans used to</p>
<p>maintain the Legal Tender amount to a substantial 1.2 billion. While the Legal Tender is secured with this assistance, how to use it to prevent manipulation and exploitation by the Japanese and their accomplices requires careful prevention by the authorities. A reporter consulted an economist on this matter, who said that the most thorough way to prevent foreign exchange manipulation is for the UK and the US to expand the embargo on Japan.</p>
<p>The embargoed goods should not be limited to military supplies; necessities should also be included. If the embargo is implemented, even if the Japanese scrape together Legal Tender from the occupied areas, they will not be able to purchase goods from the UK and the US due to the embargo, effectively freezing the Legal Tender obtained by the Japanese. At the same time,</p>
<p>shipments of goods to China should be examined to determine whether they are destined for the free areas or the occupied areas in order to determine the standard for acceptance or rejection, so as to prevent the Japanese from using the name of China to obtain materials. This move will not only render the Japanese purpose of collecting Legal Tender ineffective, but will also further damage Japan's economic structure. Since the outbreak of the European War, Japan's foreign trade has been completely dependent on the UK and US groups.</p>

<p>Following the establishment of the 100 million yuan tea agreement between China and the Soviet Union, Chinese tea bricks destined for the Soviet Union will be concentrated for export from Hong Kong, while essential goods shipped from the Soviet Union to China will be transported via the China-Soviet Union Highway. The Soviet authorities have designated cargo ships to</p>
<p>sail exclusively between Vladivostok and Hong Kong. The first ship, the "Tekseeburg," arrived in Hong Kong from Vladivostok without cargo or passengers, carrying only a small amount of ballast. It will load a large amount of tea bricks for shipment to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the tea bricks sold by the Soviet Union to China are divided into red brick tea, green brick tea, and small brick tea, and it is stipulated that red brick tea is 8.5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and weighs 2 pounds, and green brick tea is 8.25 inches long and 2.25 inches wide.</p>
<p>Small brick tea is made from fine powder sifted from red brick tea. It is said that the amount of Chinese tea needed by the Soviet Union accounts for more than 65% of China's tea production, and it is handled by the China Tea Company.</p>

<p>The plan to transfer the Public Concession’s White Russian Detachment of the Merchant Corps, consisting of more than 300 men, to the jurisdiction of the Police Department has been under consideration for a long time. According to reliable sources from the Pingming News Agency, the implementation of this plan is likely in the near future, as the authorities of the Public Concession, the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the Police Department have reached a consensus. The Special Economic Committee of the Public Concession has also concluded that after the White Russian Detachment of the Merchant Corps is transferred to the Police Department, the headquarters of the Merchant Corps can save 1,200 yuan in daily expenses and 14 transport vehicles. The Director-General of the Public Concession, Fessenden, has also suggested that it is appropriate to transfer the detachment to the Police Department. As for the date of implementation of the transfer, according to senior officers of the Merchant Corps, it may be implemented at the beginning of next month, or at the latest by March 1st of next year.</p>

<p>The painter Mr. Zhang Shanzi was highly skilled in art and renowned throughout the country. He was best known for painting tigers, hence the name "Tiger Obsessed." Since the Incident, Mr. Zhang, with his eyes on the difficult times, rose up and traveled to Europe and the United States to hold solo exhibitions, remitting all the proceeds to the country to help refugees. Countless people benefited. Mr. Zhang's reputation also spread overseas. This summer, Mr. Zhang returned to China, but unfortunately passed away in the wartime capital due to illness. Not only did the art world mourn, but all sectors of the country also expressed their sorrow. Academic organizations in the city and friends of Mr. Zhang held a public memorial service at the Gongdelin on Park Road yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to express their condolences. The image on the left shows the participants.</p>
<p>Solemn and Respectful</p>
<p>The hall was decorated simply and solemnly. In the center hung a portrait of Mr. Zhang sitting leisurely with a fan, his spirit shining brightly, commanding respect. On both sides hung elegiac couplets presented by various circles. On the altar were a bouquet of fresh flowers, clear wine, vegetables, and fruits, and lit white candles. In front of the altar was a wreath from the memorial service participants. Around the walls were displayed more than 40 genuine works by Mr. Zhang, all treasured by his former friends. In addition, there were more than a dozen photographic works by Mr. Zhang and photographs of Mr. Zhang taken by Mr. Lang Jingshan and Mr. Liu Xucang, all priced for charity sale to fund memorial expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e69">American Sympathy <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shih</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, is working hard for the country overseas, and his speeches have earned the sympathy of the American people for China. Recently, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China held its third "One Bowl of Rice" national campaign's first dinner dance at the Woldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. More than two thousand people attended, and the enthusiasm was truly inspiring. Dr. Hu gave a very moving speech at this grand event. With a scholar's attitude, he elucidated the true meaning of sympathy, grasping the various underlying factors in the audience and inspiring them to feel compassion. There is no political maneuvering in this speech; we can regard it as an academic paper, and we hope readers will not dismiss it lightly.</p>
<p>We gather here tonight not to commemorate China's war effort, but for the true purpose of expressing the pure and noble sympathy of the American people for China. This sympathy has already been demonstrated in the work of aid organizations to China. The conference held here tonight by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China and the United China Relief is a continuation of the fervent sympathy of the American people for China. In the past, your organization and others have worked hard, campaigned zealously, and raised huge sums of money to purchase large quantities of medicines and transportation equipment, which have not only benefited the refugees but also indirectly increased China's military strength. This is something that our government, people, and I personally are extremely grateful for.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I traveled from New York to the West, passing through Canada, and my travels inspired many thoughts. The people of Canada and the United States have genuine sympathy for Chinese refugees. Let me tell you some facts as proof. One day, I was eating at a restaurant in Spokane, Washington, and after I finished, a waiter in a white uniform came to me, gave me three silver dollars with a smile, and said, "Mr. Ambassador, this is my small contribution. Please accept it and use it to help Chinese refugees." Isn't this a manifestation of genuine "sympathy"?</p>
<p>A month ago, my neighbor, Mrs. Parmelee, sent a letter with two checks enclosed, totaling one thousand US dollars. One check was for the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, and the other was for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, asking them to help Chinese refugees. Two days later, I sent her the "Book of Hope" and asked her to sign it. Unfortunately, she passed away that very night. Who knew that her signature would be her last writing? Isn't this a manifestation of genuine "sympathy"?</p>
<p>Recently, it has become fashionable to explain history in terms of economic forces and economic motives. For example, the participation of the United States in the First European War is, according to this school of thought, entirely due to American financial reasons and motives.</p>
<p>Because of this line of thinking and interpretation, many new laws have been enacted to prohibit any warring country, except for those in South America, from receiving financial assistance from the United States, in the belief that the United States would no longer be drawn into foreign wars.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, these seemingly plausible economic historians have forgotten that everyone's heart still contains "sympathy." The government can legislate to prohibit financial assistance, but the government cannot legislate to eliminate the "sympathy" generated by various factors.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, The New York Times reported that six thousand American men and women, rich and poor, had donated three thousand bottles of human blood for transfusion to wounded British soldiers and civilians. The report also said that among these six thousand people, women outnumbered men, and some were over fifty years old. How can this action be explained by economic motives? We understand very well that this is entirely driven by "sympathy."</p>
<p>During one of my trips, a young reporter asked me, "What have you discovered during your travels across America?" I said, "What I have discovered is that Americans have one hundred percent sympathy for China." The reporter said, "Dr. Hu, what good is this one hundred percent 'sympathy' for China?" I replied, "Young man, don't underestimate 'sympathy.' Let me tell you now that the fighting spirit of the Chinese is so good because it is driven by your sympathy. It is precisely because of your sympathetic assistance that the suffering of our wounded soldiers and sick civilians has been reduced, and the people have not suffered from hunger and homelessness. Moreover, they have received infinite comfort in their spirits, and in the future, to achieve our freedom and independence, we will still need your 'sympathy' to help us.</p>
<p>Chinese friends, I dare say that the wholehearted efforts of my government and the people of the whole country to fight are worthy of your sympathy. The war has been going on for three years and four months. Although we are fighting for our own survival, we are also helping other countries in the world to remove the entire obstacle to democratic freedom, justice, and righteousness. If Japan were not restrained by our country, the European war would have deteriorated to an unimaginable extent.</p>
<p>Just a year ago, I spoke at the Chinese-American Cooperative Association. At that time, I said that the Sino-Japanese war would not be resolved in a short period because Japan would not be enlightened, would not understand world public opinion, and would not abandon its ambitions and embark on the path of peace. I told you that our entire country is determined to fight and will not stop until the final goal is achieved.</p>
<p>A year has passed, and now I repeat to you once again that China will not stop fighting until its goal is achieved. It may take many more months or even years to reach its goal. China must not stop fighting for the following three reasons:</p>
<p>(1) To give up China's freedom now would be hopeless. The situation in Europe now serves as a lesson to us.</p>
<p>(2) The Munich Conference is a lesson we have learned from the sidelines.</p>
<p>(3) China's victory is a matter of life and death for us and for the world's democracy. If China does not perish, democracy will not perish.</p>
<p>For these three reasons, China should not stop fighting. Finally, I want to say that the final victory will definitely be ours.</p>

<p>According to the Pushan Villa's announcement, the statistics on corpses collected from January to November this year are quite considerable. "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, corpses freeze to death." Is this truly the case? Our reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the following:</p>
<p>Statistics for This Year</p>
<p>According to the villa's announcement, this year (January) saw the collection of 826 adult corpses and 1,785 children's corpses; (February) 1,017 adult corpses and 1,669 children's corpses; (March) 951 adult corpses and 1,873 children's corpses; (April) 795 adult corpses and 1,515 children's corpses; (May) 665 adult corpses and 1,537 children's corpses; (June) 566 adult corpses and 1,641 children's corpses; (July) 551 adult corpses and 2,298 children's corpses; (August) 576 adult corpses and 2,289 children's corpses; (September) 528 adult corpses and 1,500 children's corpses; (October) 628 adult corpses and 1,549 children's corpses; (November) 715 adult corpses and 1,457 children's corpses.</p>
<p>Recent Collections</p>
<p>From December 1st to 14th of this year, a total of 398 adult corpses and 691 children's corpses were collected. The situation for the most recent three days is as follows: on the 13th, 42 adults and 51 children; on the 14th, 22 adults and 58 children. Statistics for yesterday have not yet been released. It is understood that each adult corpse requires a wooden coffin costing around 18 yuan, whereas before the war, it was only worth about 3 yuan. Furthermore, the supply of wood from Fujian and Hangzhou to Shanghai is subject to Japanese control. In a few months, there may be a shortage of wood for making coffins.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM at its headquarters in the Taihe Building. More than 30 people attended, discussing the main issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council's recent notification that each rickshaw should have three drivers rotating shifts, which conflicts with the association's current rules of four drivers per rickshaw. They plan to petition the Municipal Council again not to reduce the number of drivers to avoid increasing unemployment among rickshaw pullers.</p>

<p>The section of vacant land along the Huangpu River at the Bund Park in the Public Concession, previously leased to Jardine Matheson, with two floating docks built along the riverbank, has been reclaimed by the park due to the expiration of the contract term. All the fences have also been completely removed.</p>
<p>The Cooked Water Store Association has been approved to continue offering coal at a reduced price from December 17th to the 20th, from morning to 12:00 PM each day. The price is 70 yuan per ton in national currency, with each household limited to 1.5 tons (including a supplement of 0.5 tons for the November coal sale). The bathhouse discounted coal sales are also scheduled to begin on the 20th and will last for two days, ending on the 21st. Each household is limited to 4 tons (supplementing 2 tons for November), with each ton priced at 70 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department has issued an order stating that all incumbent officials are not allowed to concurrently serve as publishers of newspapers and magazines. If such cases exist, the state should order them to re-elect and report. The provincial party departments should instruct the county governments to handle the matter clearly.</p>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association has, in previous years, purchased large quantities of clothing, shoes, woolen sweaters, blankets, books, etc., around Christmas, which are distributed by the general association to local branches to be given to leprosy patients, costing approximately 3,000 yuan. This year, the amount has increased to 5,000 yuan. The association is specifically appealing to all sectors of society to raise donations, temporarily setting a goal of 5,000 yuan. If you have donations or daily necessities, please send them directly to the association's headquarters at 25 Chibin Road. Telephone inquiries are also welcome.</p>

<p>At 2:45 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at 340 Yangshupu Road, Pudong. The fire brigade was alerted and immediately rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. Only some household items inside the building were destroyed. It was later learned that the cause of the fire was that a Japanese resident of the building, Mr. A (28 years old), had drunk too much the night before and went to bed drunk. Later, he smoked a cigarette in bed and dropped the cigarette butt onto the bed, causing the bedding to catch fire. At the same time, the Japanese national was still sleeping soundly, so he suffered severe burns to his chest and abdomen. He was later taken to Fumin Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>At 7:35 AM yesterday, Lu Shaozhang, also known as Zhuang Xiaosanzi (30 years old), a worker at the Mei Hua Printing and Dyeing Factory at 640 Hejian Road, Yangshupu, suddenly had a wicked idea and climbed over the wall into the dyeing room. In the dark, he stole two pieces of undyed serge cloth and carried the loot out by climbing over the roof. However, when he climbed onto the roof of the coppersmith's shop, the roof there was made of lead sheets, which had been rusted by wind and rain. Because it could not withstand the weight and pressure, it suddenly burst, causing Lu to fall through the lead sheet hole into the coppersmith's shop, injuring his head, chest, hands, and feet. He groaned incessantly, but because it was late at night, no one noticed. It was not until dawn that he was discovered by other workers, who reported it to the factory management, who in turn reported it to the police and summoned an ambulance at 7:35 AM to take him to Hudong Hospital for treatment. It is said that Lu's injuries are very serious.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Police Translator Zhao Anda Steals Police Constable's Handgun, Sentenced to Eight Months, Suspended for Two Years <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Martin, the Western constable of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, hung his official handgun, along with its holster, in the police station office on the evening of the 18th of last month. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the handgun disappeared. At that time, the police station authorities believed that since outsiders could not arbitrarily enter and exit the office, it must have been done by someone from within the police station. They suspected two coolies, Zhao Yuqin from Anhui and Fu Jiaxi from Nanjing, and detained them and sent them to the First Special Court, requesting an extension of the investigation. Later, the Xinzha Patrol Team arrested Zhao Anda (19 years old, from Nanjing, working as a translator at the Jiaxing Road Police Station; his father is also a detective at the police station) in Chengdu Road. They recovered the stolen handgun and six bullets, and escorted him to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for investigation. It was found that Zhao and Fu were not involved in the handgun theft case and were not prosecuted. Zhao Anda was sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division Four, and prosecuted for theft. Judge Meng heard the case. The defendant, Zhao Anda, confessed that the handgun theft was a solitary act and that there were no other accomplices. The handgun was initially hidden at 3, Guling Road. Later, he took it to Western Shanghai to sell it, but because the price was not right, he took it back to his residence. Unfortunately, he was arrested at 741 Chengdu Road. He asked the court to give him a chance to reform himself according to the law. The court concluded the trial and handed down a judgment a few days ago. Zhao Anda was sentenced to eight months for theft, with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Two robbers broke into the Mantingfang Dim Sum Shop at 389 Shanglin Street, Wuma Road, at 11:30 PM last night, brandishing guns and attempting to rob the place. At that time, the owner, upon seeing the situation, immediately shouted to catch the thieves. Nearby Chinese constables heard the alarm and went to arrest them. The robbers, seeing the police arriving, did not have time to steal anything and fled, opening fire to resist arrest. The Chinese constables also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged multiple shots, resulting in the thief Zhou Jinsheng being shot twice in the right leg. The wounded thief fell to the ground and was captured, while the other robber escaped without a trace. At the time, a passerby, Wu Akang, 35 years old, a local, was wounded in the waist by a stray bullet. The police summoned an ambulance and sent Wu to Renji Hospital. The thief Zhou Jinsheng was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>According to a report from the News Agency, at 7:15 AM yesterday, a black-plated car No. 3794 suddenly arrived at the entrance of Xindefeng Sauce Garden and Winery at 137 Yuanfang Road, Hongkou. After the car stopped, a Japanese person and two Chinese people jumped out and went straight into the shop, asking if the shop's manager, Shi Fuyuan, was there. Shi happened to be inside the counter and stepped out, nodding in affirmation. Unexpectedly, the people suddenly pulled out handcuffs, handcuffed Shi's hands, pushed him into the car, and drove away quickly. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police received a report and immediately sent officers to investigate the truth. After investigation, it was found that the car used by the people belonged to Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Dazhonghua Hotel at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road. Just as they were about to send officers to investigate further, they suddenly received a report that Shi had been released and returned to the shop, so they terminated the investigation. They immediately summoned Shi to inquire about what happened. According to Shi, he only said that after being arrested, he was taken to the Japanese Military Headquarters and questioned once. Because there was no suspicion of any wrongdoing, he was immediately released. It is reported that Shi is from Ningbo, is currently 40 years old, and has been the manager of the shop for a long time. The shop also has a branch at 3 Avenue Anatole France in the French Concession.</p>

<p>The fourth Shenbao Cup China-America Charity Basketball Championship will kick off tomorrow night at 8:00 PM at the YMCA basketball court on Jing'an Temple Road. This year, the Chinese team has assembled the elite of Chinese basketball to form an iron army, with the absolute determination to win back the lost championship. The official ideal lineup of the Chinese team has already shown signs after the probing battle the night before. The strength of the American team has also been tested. Tomorrow night's dramatic battle will be exciting and tense, unprecedented this season. Because the YMCA's venue is extremely small, the number of tickets is severely limited. There are 317 seats downstairs and 410 seats upstairs. To prevent excessive crowding, ticket prices have been slightly increased: 5 yuan downstairs and 3 yuan upstairs. Pre-sales began yesterday. Because the number of tickets is extremely small, buyers are scrambling to buy them, not wanting to miss out. Pre-sales will continue today at the Shenbao office on Hankou Road and the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. There are not many left. Those who want to buy them should do so as soon as possible. The American team's roster was announced yesterday, totaling 12 people, mostly MacLeish officers and MacWhite team members. The list is as follows: Carter Janak (YMCA), Roach, Stock, Simpson, Henshawitz (MacLeish officers), Mayhan, Water, Jenkins, Dingwall, Smith, Murtle (MacWhite).</p>

<p>The 13th YMCA Invitational Basketball Tournament is limited to Group A this year. The Youlian and Guanghua University's Blue team withdrew temporarily, leaving only 10 teams to compete. Chinese teams include Paramount, Huaxing, Liangxi, Shanghai Bank, and Shangxing. Western teams are MacLeish White, Red, Officers, and YMCA Cubs and Giants. The opening game will be held tonight at 7:15 PM at the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. The first game is Shangxing vs. Paramount. Shangxing has Sun Huipai helping out, but a single tree is unlikely to support a large building. Paramount is the defending champion. Although Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan have left, Zhou Yaokang, Lu Gusui, and others have joined, which can be said to be a loss in one area and a gain in another. It is predicted that Shangxing will inevitably suffer at their hands. The second game is the MacLeish White and Red brothers playing against each other at 8:15 PM. MacLeish Red is weaker because their strong players have left. Tickets are divided into two types: 1 yuan upstairs and 2 yuan downstairs. The order and list are as follows:</p>

<p>The third Silver Dollar Cup Team Table Tennis Championship final match took place at the Money Trade Association hall at 7 PM the night before last. China Reserve faced Zhejiang Xing, drawing a crowd of over 700, creating a lively atmosphere. The event began with Fu Guiqing reporting on the cup competition's progress, followed by speeches from Pu Jiqing, Wang Meifeng, and Xu Duo. The competition then commenced, starting with the team final. China Reserve demonstrated superior strength, with excellent performances from players like Zhang Decai, Gu Jinxiang, and the rising star Wang Yongjin, consistently leading. Zhejiang Xing, while not lacking talent, appeared diminished in performance that night. Key players Zhu Xuejing and Wu Zhaofeng failed to secure even a single point, a major factor in their defeat. Ultimately, China Reserve triumphed over Zhejiang Xing with a score of 13 to 3, winning the championship. Following this was the individual final, where Zhang Decai of China Reserve, with his outstanding chop strokes, defeated Zhang Zhihong of Guangdong with a score of 2 to 0, claiming the individual championship. After the finals, a friendly match between Qingyun and the Silver Dollar Association was held, filled with exciting moments and earning much applause. Qingyun narrowly defeated the Silver Dollar Association with a score of 3 to 2. The awards ceremony was then held, with Li Shuxiong delivering the closing remarks and the chairman of the assembly, Sun Ruihuang, presenting the awards. The event concluded with applause from the audience, marking its successful completion. The results of each match and the final rankings are recorded below.</p>

<p>The Musée Hoang-Ho Pai-Ho (Northern Frontier Museum), abbreviated as H.H.P.H., is a museum encompassing geology, paleontology, botany, zoology, and ethnology. However, its collection area is limited to North China.</p>
<p>The founder of this museum is the famous Jesuit priest, P. Licent. As far as we know, he even served as a guest advisor for the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of China for a time. He has been in China for 27 years, having visited various provinces in North China and Mongol leagues and banners. Recently, he even took his collection of insect and plant specimens to France for identification because several newly discovered species have not yet been named.</p>
<p>Besides the director, Father Licent, Father P. Teillard de Chardin has contributed the most to the Northern Frontier Museum. Although Father Teillard de Chardin serves in China, he holds a position at the Geological Survey Institute in Beiping. At the same time, he is the president of the French Geological Society. In 1929, when "Peking Man" was discovered at Zhoukoudian near Fangshan, southwest of Beiping, he went to investigate and conduct detailed research, confirming that it belonged to the same category as Heidelberg Man. Father Teillard de Chardin's name has thus attracted the attention of academic circles in China.</p>
<p>In addition to the two Fathers Licent, others at the Northern Frontier Museum engaged in scientific research include botanist Father Roi, mineralogist Father Trasert, and zoologist Father Leroy, who came to China in August of the year before last.</p>
<p>If we want to know about the geology of the Yellow River basin, we must consult them. The work of the Northern Frontier Museum has now become an affiliated institution of the Tianjin Institut des Hautes Études Industrielles et Commerciales. This is, of course, very beneficial for students' research. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e92">A Discussion on Two Congees and One Meal <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspapers that a certain school has initiated a change in daily meals to one congee, one rice, and one noodle dish, and other schools have followed suit. This certainly saves a lot of rice for schools with a large number of students. However, the price of flour is also very expensive now. We occasionally eat a few meals of noodles and find the taste to be very good, but eating noodles all the time can become tiresome. Moreover, Southerners are accustomed to eating rice, and Northerners are accustomed to eating wheat. Some people here simply cannot get used to eating noodles.</p>
<p>According to previous legends, ordinary families originally only had two meals a day (wealthy families and farmers were exceptions). I don't know when it changed to three meals a day. However, habit becomes nature, and it may not be possible to reduce three meals to two in reality. However, in this extraordinary period, "frugality and economizing on food and clothing" is something that everyone should follow. Now is the time to endure hardship. How can we compare ourselves to peacetime? Ask the pitiful refugees, have they ever had two balanced meals? Even pampered students cannot be as willful and indulgent as they used to be but should prioritize thrift and hardship (the author still remembers when students at the university would throw bowls and plates because the meals were not good). At the same time, I implore the school authorities to consider all the students in the school. If the majority are Southerners, they may as well change to two congees and one meal a day. The distribution is: eat congee for breakfast and dinner, and rice for lunch. Because the time between breakfast and lunch is shorter, eating congee is enough to satisfy hunger (some people eat a little dim sum for breakfast and get by). The time between lunch and dinner is longer, so lunch is called a "waist-supporting meal" and cannot be saved. When eating congee for dinner, it won't make you feel hungry because you will go to sleep soon after eating. In terms of economy, it is still worthwhile because one bowl of rice can be turned into at least two bowls of congee, and the expensive flour is not much cheaper to eat (just look at the fact that each set of fritters and fried dough sticks has risen to one dime). Therefore, the author offers this humble opinion, not only for schools, but also for general families on the isolated island, factories, and other places, which may as well follow suit to comply with the "economic principle of reducing food."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Attention Wearers of Western Suits <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Li Dun</p>
<p>It is always appropriate to dress in accordance with one's status. One should never try to dazzle people with their attire. Those who can afford to wear a smart Western suit are probably in the upper-middle class. However, there are many things to pay attention to when wearing a Western suit, and one should never be careless. If one is careless in some aspect, one may be considered to be a member of a so-called "outlandish" group. Therefore, I will write down the points to pay attention to, hoping that all gentlemen who wear Western suits will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>(1) Do not forget to fasten the trousers buttons. (2) The sleeves should not be folded back. When working in the office, two black cloth sleeves can be used instead. (3) Hats should be worn straight and level, or slightly forward, and should not be tilted back or to the left or right. (4) Hats with a brim should be worn with the seam of the brim on the left side. (5) Leather shoes should be brushed clean often, and mud should not be allowed to stick to them. (6) Do not make loud noises when walking on the floor. (7) Do not put both hands in your pockets or chest, etc. (8) Always wear a tie. (9) Collars made of velvet or fur are for women, patients, and the elderly, and young people should not overuse them. (10) A Western-style top and Chinese-style bottoms, or a Chinese-style top and Western-style bottoms, are the most inappropriate and should be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Talking About Hot Pot Lamb <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Yi</p>
<p>Lamb has been considered a delicacy since ancient times, so those who created characters used "beauty," "soup," "shame," and "fresh" in relation to lamb. However, Southerners often dislike lamb and hate its muttony smell. In the past, when I traveled to the old capital, I ate at lamb restaurants every meal because they were cheap and palatable. I would eat with one or two friends, get drunk and full, and return home. The cost was never more than two yuan (this refers to ten years ago; with today's high cost of living, it must be more than that). Many of the restaurants in the north belong to the Muslim faith. The signs of lamb restaurants are almost everywhere. Those who are not Muslim are commonly called "Da Jiao Guan" (Big Teaching Hall), and they prominently write the words "Pork Restaurant" to distinguish themselves. If you don't know the local customs, you will find the words "Pork Restaurant" strange at first glance. However, gourmets often don't like to go to pork restaurants (pork restaurants also sell lamb), saying that they are not as clean as lamb restaurants. I don't have a particular fondness for lamb. In fact, there is nothing else to eat in the north that can be served with meals besides lamb. Moreover, the "big-tailed sheep" produced in the north has meat that is not muttony and is different from the sheep in the southern provinces. Therefore, hot pot lamb is considered the ultimate delicacy. Hot pot lamb in Peiping is a staple in every household except in the summer. (Grilled lamb is also available in August and September.) It can be eaten repeatedly without getting tired of it. In recent years, I have lived in Shanghai. Due to frequent entertainment, I only think of hot pot lamb in very cold weather. When I occasionally try it, this is because there are few lamb that are not muttony in this area. The other day, Wang Weiwo invited me to drink at the Yuanxing Restaurant on Ma Huo Road, a genuine Muslim restaurant. The food was very rich, and the meat was not muttony. The hot pot lamb was so tender that it was not much different from the big-tailed sheep. When I asked the waiter, he replied that the sheep was produced in Huzhou. The sheep in Huzhou may be slightly inferior to the big-tailed sheep, but in the south, it is already rare to find. The other dishes at Yuanxing Restaurant, such as "Pan-fried Lamb Chops," "Braised Lamb Strips," "Stewed Lamb," and "Dry Fried Chicken," also have special characteristics. The excellence of the chefs and the thoughtful service always make people recall the flavors of the old capital.</p>
<h3 id="e95">One Week Economic Menu <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In the previous issues of this magazine, the special issue on capital menus could not be published on time. From this issue onwards, the special issue is temporarily concluded, so the author is here again to serve the readers. In the past two months, the cost of living has continued to increase. How can we talk about economy? The price of each stone of national rice has broken the 100-yuan mark. Those heinous rice weevils sharpen their teeth and suck blood, making unjust gains every day and feeling very proud. They don't know that the common people of thousands of households are heartbroken and weeping! Under such circumstances, even eating plain rice is not economical. How can we even talk about economy when we have to use firewood, coal, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar to cook vegetables? But how can we eat plain rice without vegetables? Therefore, the author can only do her best and continue to prepare this menu of two meat and two vegetarian dishes per day, and let the readers stretch themselves as much as they can.</p>

<p>The other day, this magazine published Tian Qingjun's great work, "A Few Things Before Going to Bed," which immediately caught the author's attention. I have been following it, but the work after sleeping has not been mentioned. The following three things are what the author must do after sleeping. It has been almost three years, and it has unconsciously become a habit. If one is forgotten, then it feels very uncomfortable. Now I offer it to the gentlemen who do not yet have this habit. If you can start doing it from today, then after a considerable period of time, there will be unexpected results.</p>
<p>(1) Wash your nose: Washing your face and gargling in the morning is essential, but before washing your face, fill a basin with water, preferably cold water, then immerse your nose in the water and gently suck in the water. Do not use too much force, so that the cold water is sucked into just the right part of the nose, then you will not feel uncomfortable. Then spray the water out. Do this sucking and spraying, spraying and sucking many times, and you will feel that your nose seems to be exceptionally clear. The nose is a very important organ on the human body. We are constantly passing air through our nostrils to our lungs. However, the air is always mixed with dust, and sometimes germs are mixed in with the dust, which is so dangerous. Fortunately, there are nose hairs in the nostrils, which prevent the entry of dust, and they stay in the nostrils. If they are not removed, then they will be dirty and unbearable, so you must wash them away with water to keep the nose clean, which is as important as washing your face and gargling every day. Washing the nose also has a clever side effect, which is that once you get a cold (flu), the nose seems to be blocked. If you wash your nose with cold water every day, you can not only prevent the spread of colds, but if you are unfortunate enough to have one, you can also make the nostrils not feel blocked and as clear as usual, but there is some difference in the throat.</p>
<p>(2) Wash your face with cold water. Generally, people always like to wash their face with hot water, but washing your face with cold water has many benefits. In addition to saving fuel, it can also prevent the spread of influenza because the face is in contact with cold water every day. Of course, cold water is more stimulating than hot water. If you are not careful and feel some cold, it does not matter because the resistance of the face is increased by frequent stimulation with cold water, so you do not care about some cold. If you take a cold bath, that is even better.</p>
<p>(3) Drink a cup of salt water. After washing your face and gargling, drink a cup of salt water while your stomach is empty. Although the effect is not very great, it is not small either. Because table salt has antiseptic properties, drinking some salt water is also effective if your throat is dry or inflamed. When the stomach is empty, it can cleanse the stomach and intestines because the food eaten overnight has all been digested after one night, but some residue always remains in the stomach and intestines. If it is not removed, it will rot. Drinking some salt water down can make the stomach and intestines clean immediately.</p>
<p>These above three things must be done with perseverance, every day, every month, every year, then you will not have to consult a doctor.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Origin of Road Names <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Chou</p>
<p>I happened to read "Police Voice Monthly," which had an article that described in detail the origin of the names of Nanjing Road, Zhengfeng Street, and Stone Road in this city, which is something that local people should know. Therefore, I have specially recorded it here to send to this magazine.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road: When the capital of China was in Peiping and the most perfect main road in the British Concession was named Nanjing Road, Peking Road was placed behind it. Was it intended to distinguish between the north and south directions, or was it because Nanjing Road was the capital of this province and it was honored as a giant? In fact, it is not entirely true. Sino-British trade was based on the Treaty of Nanjing of the Renyin Year of Daoguang, which is also known as the Treaty of Five Ports. At the beginning of the establishment of the port, this road was the starting point, so it was named after Nanjing.</p>
<p>Zhengfeng Street: Zhengfeng Street is another name for Guangdong Road. When examining the origin of its name, there was a soy sauce garden named Zhengfeng, which was opened in the middle section of the road. Over the years, it has been called by that name.</p>
<p>Stone Road: Fujian Road in the Public Concession is commonly known as Stone Road. When examining the origin of its name, it is said that during the Daoguang years, there was a wealthy man named Li in the east of the county government in Shanghai City, who married his daughter to the Qu family in Zhabei. The Li family prepared a large dowry for his daughter to marry into the Qu family. Because the fields outside the city gate were vertical and horizontal and the roads were rugged, the Li family prepared thousands of large stones. Starting from the river bank (Yangjing Bridge), they placed a stone every foot to the Wusong River to benefit pedestrians. Afterward, pedestrians found it convenient, so it was named Stone Road.</p>

<p>Now is not the time for "valuing men over women." Now should be "gender equality."</p>
<p>Therefore, after reading Ren Jiongjun's "Story of the Nunnery" in the ninth issue of this magazine, I couldn't help but speak out on behalf of us women (although this is a "story").</p>
<p>Because we cannot think that by sending all women into nunneries, they will "never" have children; men outside will still "tempt" them! Although it is said that "nuns" having abortions is "justified" because they have not been "married"! However, it is still not "elegant"! My opinion is: in addition to "promoting the establishment of more nunneries, we must also have a "National Monk Movement"! This is the only way to eliminate all "irregular" actions so that the nuns can "practice Buddhism in peace," avoiding "married women are exceptions" and other "exceptional" absurdities!</p>
<p>However, those gentlemen who advocate kicking married women out can avoid being monks because they themselves will not do things that slap themselves in the face by "making" nuns into "married women"!</p>
<p>However, there is also a "difficulty": what if monks and nuns also "do that thing"?</p>
<p>I also have a "solution": "Married nuns are also an exception!" (Forgive me! Forgive me!)</p>

<h3 id="e100">The School Changed "New Books" <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Li Song</p>
<p>Some time ago, I heard that my nephew's school was going to move and that it would be very far from home, which made me worried - such as the dangers on the road, the cold winter weather. It was indeed difficult for my young nephew to go to school so far away. But later, the school decided not to move, which made everyone in the family happy, thinking that it would be much more reassuring to study at a nearby school.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, my nephew came home from school as usual, and I had to urge him to review his homework, but when he walked up to me carrying his schoolbag, he looked frightened and stuttered, "The teacher took the books away." I was very surprised, and I quickly opened his schoolbag and looked inside. Sure enough, there were only a few exercise books left, and not a single textbook. I thought that perhaps he had committed a punishment at school, and the books were taken away as a warning, and they would be returned the next day. So I asked him what he had done and blamed him for not following the rules at school. But after asking, I wronged my young nephew; he had not committed anything. He told me, "Today in class, the teacher told us to take out all the textbooks and put them on the corner of the desk. The teacher took them away one by one and said that this was an "order" to take them away and that new books would be issued to us tomorrow and that we would not have to pay for them." My nephew seemed to be a little proud when he said this. The children were happy to have new books to read and the parents would not have to spend any money, but I was a little skeptical: changing books in the middle of the year naturally had other intentions. Will the children's studies be affected by this?</p>
<p>Sure enough, the facts came. When school was dismissed at noon the next day, my nephew jumped and brought the new books that the school had exchanged and handed them to me to look at. The first thing that caught my eye was "National Elementary School Textbooks," and the "color" was a little different. After carefully flipping through them, I saw that the contents of the arithmetic book had not changed at all, and it was completely reprinted from the previous book. The knowledge book was full of flowers, trees, and trees, and the brief history of the founding of the country, the origins of commemorative days, and so on were gone. The most shocking thing was the language book, in which I found many "ridiculous" sentences.</p>
<p>A child's brain is a blank sheet of paper, and he cannot be allowed to get stained with stains. "What is going on?" My second brother said lightly, "×× is a middle school attached to a university, and the reputation of the elementary school is quite good. The school authorities will naturally take appropriate measures. There is no need to worry now, and we will wait until the winter vacation. But we must also forgive the school for its situation. It is difficult to find a school building at the moment. Fortunately, the school has always been famous and will certainly not fail the children and their parents!"</p>
<p>The school's situation, being a student's parents...</p>

<p>Liu Rushi, from within the sedan, promptly replied, "Someone is behaving improperly; please help!" The dark figure rushed over, revealing a burly man who stretched out his iron arms and struck the ruffians. Zhao Qi launched a kick, aiming for the man's kidneys, but the man caught it with one hand and threw him sprawling. Only then did the ruffians realize the man's strength and quickly helped Zhao Qi as they scurried away like rats. Liu Rushi leaned out of the sedan, recognizing the man as the Iron Beggar, Shi Da. Overjoyed, she called out, "Brave Shi!" Shi Da walked over and said, "Who could it be? It's actually Miss Liu. I was just returning from Wu Family Dam when I heard the commotion here, thinking it was robbers, so I came to help. What a coincidence! Those ruffians are truly detestable, but they're no match for me. Don't be alarmed, Miss. Where are you coming from?" Liu Rushi then told him everything and thanked him profusely. Shi Da said, "It's late. Let me escort you home." Liu Rushi thanked him again, and the sedan bearers immediately lifted the sedan and hurried along. With Shi Da guarding her from behind, her heart felt no fear. Arriving at the Liu family gate, Shi Da bid farewell. Liu Rushi insisted that Shi Da come tomorrow for drinks to thank him for his kind assistance. Shi Da readily agreed and strode away. After Liu Rushi returned home, she told her sister and Aunt Xu about the incident, and they were all delighted. The next day, Liu Rushi finished her toilette when she noticed a poem by Zhang Tianru held down by a jade lion paperweight on her desk. She picked it up and read it, her delicate brows furrowing slightly as she sighed softly, "Teacher, I admire your talent, and I appreciate your earnest instruction, which has helped me improve in my studies. However, to ask me, Liu Rushi, to serve you as a wife is something difficult to achieve. In truth, my heart already belongs to Chen Wuzi. His unrestrained talent is what I admire in my heart, and his aloof nature is especially what I value. Alas, Teacher, Teacher, I must disappoint your deep affection." She then grasped her soft brush and composed a poem, subtly expressing that she could not comply with Tianru's wishes and thanking him for his affection. She wrote it with great tact, then had her foster mother, Aunt Xu, cook two dishes and send them along with the poem to Zhang Tianru's home. In the afternoon, Shi Da arrived. Liu Rushi led him to the outer room of the upper floor, where she prepared fine wine and invited him to drink. Shi Da did not stand on ceremony and drank from large bowls. Rushi sat beside him, chatting with him. Listening to his words, she found him to be very ambitious. Rushi seized the opportunity to encourage him. Hearing Liu Rushi's words, Shi Da drank while surveying his surroundings and sighed, "Heaven has endowed me with a body of bronze muscles and iron bones, which should be used to serve the country far and wide. Alas, I have not encountered someone who recognizes my worth, and I am reduced to poverty. Unwilling to serve others obsequiously, I have hidden myself among beggars. It is rare for Miss Liu to understand me, which makes me very happy. From now on, I am willing to invigorate my spirit and serve the country, as long as there is a path forward." Liu Rushi listened and nodded, her mind occupied with a matter. She then saw Aunt Xu hurrying up the stairs, saying, "Two guests have arrived." Liu Rushi was about to ask who they were when she heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The two guests had already ascended.</p>
