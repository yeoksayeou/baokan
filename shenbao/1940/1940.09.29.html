<h3>德義日締結同盟反響　美加緊援助中英兩國　威爾斯譴責日本破壞遠東現狀　任何意外謂美已有應付準備</h3>
<p>華盛頓羅斯福總統、於讀悉德·義·日三國在柏林簽訂新的三强軍事協定之文吿後、昨日下午三時（上海時間今晨四時）、卽在此開召集全體內閣緊急會議、總統爲審愼起見、對於此决禁運廢鐵、意在制裁日本事、則避免討論、僅對美國或將運輸大批轟炸機與英國之報吿、表示惑疑云、國務卿赫爾昨日語記者云、簽訂三强軍事協定、早爲此問意料中事、美國因考慮及此、故華盛頓方面始有貸款二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元與中國、與禁止廢鐵出口制裁日本之舉動、赫爾云、「據美國之認識、此項軍事協定、對於數年來已有情勢、於實質方面言、並不致有何變史、今突然發出宣吿者、不過將已往所有存在之關係、略爲劃淸分野而已、此種協定之簽立、此間早已料及、而美國於決定其外交政策、亦曾將此點加入考慮」、國會方面、對此軍事同盟、暫時拒絕批評、允以對日本此舉、影響美幽將來外交政策、更未發一言、惟有數方面預料、不久之將來、英美兩國、或定有更積極之發展、國會議員某君云、日本依附於羅馬、柏林軸心、適與義大利參加歐戰前、與德國已有秘密諒解之存在、完全相同、（二十八日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此問官塲昨夜宣稱、美國不因德·義·日成立新公的而受特殊之煩擾、將繼續以除戰爭外之各種方面援助英國、德·義·日新公的、不渦使前已明顯但未正式確定之時局結晶化耳、就所可見者言之、美國將繼續保持其對遠東時局之現有態度、而堅持現狀之維持、自一九三七年有德·義·日締結盟的之說後、美國政策卽認德·義·日三國爲可能的同盟國、此卽美國海軍擴張之理由也、今之公約、適向美國人民宣示歐戰非爲與他人無關之事件、但爲遍及世界約侵略行爲之一部而已、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>俄亥俄州克里夫蘭　美副國務卿威爾期今日在外交參議會發表演說、重申美國將予英國以一切物質上援助之意嚮、據稱、遠東方面之任何問題、無有不可以談判方法加以和平解決者、但美政府對於任何意外已有準備、一般人鑒於軸心國與日本之新約、皆認此項演辭含有特殊重要意義、氏又譴責日本之攻擊越南、爲威脅法殖民地之完整、與日政府尊重現狀之諾言殊相違反、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美政府今後將對東·西兩半球與極權國家作戰之民族予以更大之援助、以對付德義··日聯盟、赫爾國務卿昨夜明白宣示、軸心國對美恫嚇之答復、將爲對英增加軍火輸出、對華增加道德與物質上援助、對日加强經濟壓力、（二十八日國際社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日下午召集全體內閣緊急會議後、此間認爲、美國卽將更進而助英、以爲日本等國最近成立之三國軍事協定之答覆、總統昨日異常忙迫、與各政府領袖在白宮作重要會商、但會商結果如何、官方尙無陳述、英大使洛齊安及倫敦經濟報主筆、均前往白宮與總統會商十五分鐘、談話要旨、乃重在增加美國對英之援助、據云、英國外交界中人、咸籲請總統、又有非官方之美代表團、亦對增加援央之舉、表示擁護、並請總統施諸實行、聞羅斯福已予接受、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據此間接近白宮之政界人士談稱、美國於實施對日鐵屑禁運後、將再取報復措施、阻止日本在亞洲進一步之行動、衆料鐵屑禁運後之步驟或係汽油禁運、政界人十繼謂、美國之最後目的、將爲完全停止美·日兩國間之貿易關係、（二十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>美艦駛菲列濱</p>
<p>火魯奴奴非官方昨晚在此聲稱、美國艦隊一部份、已於去週離火魯奴奴前往菲列濱、其他艦隊、包括航空母艦一艘、則有隨時自夏威夷駛往菲列濱之可能、此間以爲、海部所以命令航空母艦一艘至菲外濱者、乃表示華盛頓意欲加强菲列濱「飛行驅逐艦」遠程轟炸機之實力、某某方而猜測、認爲軍艦多艘首途往菲列濱之舉、乃係日常公寓、　此决艦數之多、實足表美中國海軍在遠東之實力已大事增强、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　海軍部昨晚宣稱、昨日三强軍事協定之簽立、已將世界情勢變更頗多、致美國艦隊自夏威夷開往大陸之計劃、亦須更改、此等　艦是吾仍駛回夏威夷、海軍部則無一定之表示、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間政界聲稱、日本方面之要求或威脅、無論其對於上海或中國其他各處之美人利益、抑或對於美國所宣布必須保持原有現狀、不得以武力威脅强令變更之區域如荷屬東印度而發、美國將繼續反對之、絕不變其態度、美政府與大多數國會議員皆以爲、德·義·日之正式聯盟、不過促使公共注意於久已存在、而美國於一九三八年初製定其國防政策時、卽已予以完全考慮時局耳、國務卿赫爾與總統晤商後、卽發表一文、聲明德·義·日盟約並未在實質上變更時局、官塲所稱、美國於製定汎美政策時、卽已顧及德·義·日密切勾結一語、不啻聲明美國今後將繼續採行同樣政策、美政府不欲對日本之威脅而屈服、况此種威脅、顯出於力量虛弱之情緒、而非基於力量堅强之情緒、換言之、此約之締結、大都因德國攻英無功、日本在華失敗、東京與柏林乃覺有鼓起國內人心之必要耳、其實德日皆不處於彼此可互助之地位、至於日本可攫奪荷屬東印度或英屬馬來、以取橡皮、油、錫等原料之設想、亦無足重視、日本殊不願與第一等强國作戰也、說者謂今有一事可使美國輿情贊助劇烈行動者、卽美國在其重要利益被認爲受危迫之方面公開運動是也、日本蔑　國際公法與道德之行動、或不足鼓起輿情、然日本完全小顧美國之志願、而直接危害美國之耳、日本與德·義尤聯絡合作、以樹立新秩序而維持之、惟須俟目前未與聞戰爭之一國攻擊締約國之一時、德·義·日之互助、始克實現、此種空泛方式、似於第三國如美國者加入戰局時、始在日本發生關係、但不知埃及對義實戰時、此約將適用吾、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>倫教　此間現對羅馬、柏林軸心繼與日訂同盟後、意圖拉攏西班牙之舉、認爲係表示德國現價戰爭勢將繼續持久、同時對英之閃電戰術已歸於失敗、故德元首希特勒急於覓取新的活動的同盟、英人方面評論日本加入柏林、羅馬軸心之舉、認爲德國所可因以得到者、惟宜傳之價値而已、其英國官員稱、一據余觀之、日本已加入一種對彼毫無益處、反足以招致一獨自不能勝任之工作之同盟」、英國各界咸認、此項新同盟乃二向美國之喧嘩「威脅」云、英人咋晚對該約之第一反響、僉認爲暫時只爲一空虛之恫嚇、據消息靈通界所知、英人認爲、目前斷不能影響一般情勢、進一步而言、德義亦絕不能藉日本之援助而對英採取較强之行動、就私人之意見、英政府對此舉亦絕不感到詫異、（二十八日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　倫教各日報一致對三國同盟出以嗤笑、「每日郵報」稱、該同盟與前此之反共公約相似、實毫無可怕之點、惟現時之三國聯盟已無復反對布爾希維克主義矣、彼此現時共同之目標、在於建設歐·亞之「新秩序」、該報並稱、然而該同盟用以對付美·蘇二國、乃屬顯而易見之事、蘇聯或對一事感興趣、卽該三訂盟國之對蘇關係、仍將不致有何巨變、惟渠當感到無論如何、此約之用意、乃在將蘇聯「打入冷宮」云、（二十八日合衆電）利益、則美國輿悄未必能恕之也、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>紐約　紐約各報頃以大字標題及顯著地位、刊載德·義·日柏林協定消息、而認此項軍事同盟爲反美之一種動作、各報皆以爲、此新同盟、係全能國家企圖阻止美國參加歐戰、或迫令美國於同時應付東西兩面之戰爭、第一篇反應此新協定之文字、係紐約太陽報之社評、該報稱、該同盟明係警吿美國勿干涉現在世界其他部分進行之戰爭、該報又謂、柏林協定、乃係對羅斯福總統所宣布、意在對付日本之鋼鐵禁運之銳利答辯此新協定之簽字國、至少已表明此時若輩不願與蘇聯發生反感、該報又稱、西班牙報紙對此協定之歡忭卽可徴知不論西班牙是吾加入此種協定、西班牙政府係贊同此項獨裁國家同盟者、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交記者、論德·義·日三國新公約謂、日本可謂被曳人　種　助於自己、反使自己獨自担任困難工作之公約、蓋德·義現方出其全力以</p>
<p>英認日係作繭自縛不足影響歐洲戰局</p>
<p>攻英國、示能以其原料或他物供給日本、而日本則反須對德·義有所供獻也、公約條文之一顯專對美國而設、究此公約之主要旨趣、無非欲置美國於戰局之外怔、公約中對於蘇聯之特殊保留、似表示簽約國所慮者不在蘇聯、就已發表之公約全文觀之、時局不因此而起重大變化、茍無秘密條文、則此約對於英國與軸心國間之戰爭、應無何種影響、此約不過宣布日本方面之交戰狀態而非中立</p>
<h3>三國協定不能動搖　中國抗戰決心　反足促成民主堅強陣綫　中國政府將發正式聲明</h3>
<p>重慶　此間官方頃稱、德·義·日軍事經濟同盟之成立、並不足奇、而其對中國抗戰以求最後勝利之決心、亦絲毫不能搖動、官方又稱、中國決可獲得蘇聯之甚大援助、此項協定、對於中國並不致如一般想像之惡劣、因其可使民主國家、結成一堅强聯合陣錢、月可使中國獲得英·美方而更積極之援助、官方又稱、中國政府認蘇聯完全係一居於民主國與全能國間之中立者、故其對華之援助、決不致受影響、權威觀察家稱、英·美兩國或將因此採取較前更堅强之遠東政策、大公報於社論中、總括協定之內容、謂此協定、不外（一）互相承認「歐亞新秩序」、而使德·義對中國抱敵對態度、（二）協定中所稱未參戰之國、顯係指稱美國、因是美國力被認爲理想敵、（三）特別提明蘇聯、以使蘇聯保持中立、由於此三點、足以徴知美、日戰爭、卽將爆發、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　關於德、義、日三國簽訂軍事同盟事、聞中國政約或當於今晚發表正式聲明、以闡明中國對於此項盟約之立塲、此外、中國在德、義兩國之外交代表、此後如何處置、聞亦在當局考慮之中、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>三國盟約的分析觀</h3>
<p>德義日三國軍事政治經濟同盟條約，已於前日在柏林正式簽字。這是今日國際間一件大事，但絕對不是出乎意外的偶發事件，而是醞釀了許久，一再觀望，一再頓挫，直到最近，方始不得不下決心，辦此手續。這不是創了新局面·不過告了一段落。在日本參加反共公約之後·當時即有進一步結盟約擬議，過去德義曾經一再敦促日本接受此議，日本却首鼠兩端，德義纔撇開了日本，訂立了所謂兩國的「鋼協定」。時日推移·形勢艱澀、日本除了向德義口中分嘗了越南的一臠之外，外交到處碰壁；德國閃電戰術亦未能一氣呵成，歐戰乃繼遠東戰事而成凝凍之局；美國態度復經再三測騐而顯見其確是堅定；總之，事實所示，德日兩國速戰速決的戰略旣各得了相反的結果，於是兩反相合，重新放棄其各自偸雞的手法，回復到了共同牽牛的途徑。兩年來，誰都覷破這是必然的趨歸，但是在息事髯人的意識之下，不免希望其萬一不如此。所以說，三國同盟的終於實現，確非意外。這是値得首先指明的。</p>
<p>遼寗的星火未能及時撲滅，戰爭勢如燎原，終致牽涉全世界，幾乎早已成爲世界。宿命了，而現在三國盟的的成立，不過證明了世界大戰的必然性，說明了大戰的愈迫愈近。但亦並非謂大戰即此發軔，現在還祗是大戰的一個先聲而已。換句話說，最近的將來，歐戰仍是歐戰，遠東戰仍是遠東戰，一時還不致於混合爲一。原因是三國盟的的本質，是消極而不是積極的，是一個空架子而不是一個爆炸物；他最主要的一條，關於所謂互相援助，必須在第三國加入了歐戰或遠東戰之後，纔能援引。即以互相援助而論，除了遙爲呼應，同聲吶喊之外，其實也是彼此無從致力，而解決越南却是不在盟的內的最妙例外。這是値得指明的第二點。</p>
<p>盟的條文一共六條，非常簡單。第一條是「如意」，第二條是「算盤」；德義怎樣領導英國？日本怎樣領導中國？反正已經破臉交戰了，姑且寫幾條盟的來佔了紙上的便宜　亦算一時快意，是不必論。但是歐洲不止英國，亞洲不止中國；據論西班牙行將參加德義軸心，根據盟的第一條，日本必然承認且尊重德義的領導西班牙，可不能不一問弗朗弗朗哥將軍意下如何？至於所謂大東亞，迭據日方表示，範圍遠及荷屬東印度，荷印如何接受領導姑置不問，但是介乎中國與荷印之間，還有菲列賓，盟的忘記了列爲例外，則根據盟的第二條，德義當然承認且尊重日本的有權加以領導，然他們訂的的時候，又忘記了沒有吩咐美國也簽一個字。像土耳其、他跨歐亞兩洲，不像蘇聯承明文規定而得特別待遇，大的應該東西奉承，接受雙方領導吧！</p>
<p>盟的第三條是最有恫嚇性的一條，規定「簽字國之一，倘爲歐戰或遠東戰尙未牽涉之國家所攻擊，三國當在政治經濟軍事三方面互相援助」。就表面上觀之，這條最關重耍，即是所謂同盟。可是試加進一步的檢討，當能恍然於其眞意：第一，這一條文等於聲明歐戰和遠東戰乃是截然兩事、假定現行情勢小變，日本對於歐戰仍持一不介入政策一，而德義對於遠東戰，也並不幫助日本侵略中國，所以這條的精意，不過是防止第三國站在英國或中國的一面而參加戰爭罷了。這裏所謂第三國，當然第一是指美國而言，（雖然蘇聯土耳其希臘也有被視作對象的可能），但是即以美國而論，問題却並不單純，所謂，遭受攻擊」，在程度上必須有一個確切的解釋，譬如說，美國繼續以飛機軍艦接濟英國，算不算攻擊德義呢？第二，假定眞正遇到了適用第三條的塲合，三國之間究竟如何能化「政治經濟軍事三方面互相援助，」這些似乎是實際的技術問題而已，夷考實際之實，他們各自爲戰，已經拼了全力，怎樣還可互助？假定說，美國代英國擔當了新加坡與香港的防務，英國在東亞的一切軍備，悉數騰挪到歐洲與德義作戰了，試問德義要日本怎樣辦？而日本能怎樣？敢怎樣？假如日本肯派遣軍艦到大西洋或地中海去助戰，老實說，三國早已同盟，不待今日了。美國倘若根據新加坡與香港，在東亞有更一步的舉動，試問德義又能怎樣援助日本。所以說盟的第三條，驟視之，似乎很嚴重，但是稍加推敲，實在很空洞；德義還祗是德義，日本還祗是日本，一加一而除二，仍等於一，並沒有加得分毫。至於盟的第五條，所謂三國盟的對蘇聯不生影響，這與三國並沒有宣告廢棄的反共公的，可以相參照；他們以白熊爲呆鳥，而白熊大的也可以暫時裝儍。盟的第六條規定有效期間十年，是條文八股中的一股，是「長命富貴」一類的禱祝；在一切條的可以隨便撕毀的今日，相應不理可也。</p>
<p>當然，我們並非以爲這三國盟的是兒戲；蓋三國同盟雖非意外，雖非創作，然結束了兩年來的混沌而吿了一段落。這一段落之後，行見國際別有明期而堅定的發展，前因後果，容當續論。</p>

<p>東京　今晨各報皆載社論、謂日本實爲美國之態度與行動所迫、而與德·義同盟、惟大都認該同盟非軍事性質、日日新聞預料、三强國對新秩序將作長期之奮鬥、蓋美國必繼續力爭現狀之維持、甚至英國失敗後、亦必如是也、朝日新聞謂、關於蘇聯之特別條款、不特因德·蘇曾訂互不侵犯協定、且因日·蘇關係在新亞洲秩序中甚佔重要故也、由此觀之、日·德·義今皆認蘇聯爲新興之强國、力能在建設世界新秩序中予以合作、此特別條款、且於日本將來對蘇之外交有重要意義、該報續謂、經濟界預料、美國將加重對日壓力、但彼等現計畫轉向南進、一面對經濟力加緊縮、藉此可以抵銷所受美國之不利影響、該的雖爲一種軍事同盟、但並不含有日本參加歐戰之意、惟吾人應付世界目前局勢之責任、確將因以增重耳、民間對於此舉表面尙稱安靜、商業區中僅數厦懸有義·德·日之國旗、預料不日將有羣衆大集會、以示擁護此新同盟、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　關於美國新聞記者所提出之詢問、德·義·日三國公的、是吾針對蘇聯一事、日外務省發言人昨就該公的之第三條及第五條加以答覆曰、第三條與第五條卽足說明此問題、該發言人繼鄭重指出、簽訂三國公的、幷不能視爲改變日本之不干涉政策、至少在暫時、總之、無人能預測將來之發展、（二十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>東京市面未見興奮</p>

<h3>美國的太平洋政策</h3>
<p>— 原著者John　Gunther　載美國外交季刋</p>
<p>其次，日美若果開戰，菲律濱羣島必成爲日本襲擊第一個目標。美國防衛這些羣島的能力問題，曾引起許多專家的熱烈爭辯。多數意見均認爲菲律濱不能抵禦日軍連續不斷或大規模的進擊。要使菲律濱無懈可擊，至少須花費十萬萬美元，但在目前環境之下，美國國會是不致通過的。</p>
<p>美國在中國和菲濱的地位，是相當脆弱的。美國萬一和日本開戰，誰都看得到，重心將在太平洋中部的防綫。這條防綫這是美國的海軍了。</p>
<p>據一九四〇年一月一日的統計，美日兩國海軍力比較如下：</p>
<p>在道些眾艦中，美國方面有戰鬥艦一艘，輕巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦一百十五艘，潛水艇三十二艘，已是超過年限，就是近於廢棄不可用了。在日本方面，也有戰鬥艦一艘，重巡洋艦五艘，輕巡洋艦八艘，驅逐艦三十六艘，潛水艇十九艘，已是超過年限。</p>
<p>自一九四〇年一月一日起，美國軍艦在建造中的，計有新戰鬥艦八艘（三十萬噸）航空母艦二艘（三萬四千七百噸），輕巡洋艦六艘（四萬四千噸），巨型水雷數設艇一艘，驅逐艦三十一艘（四萬九千九百八十噸），潛水艇十五艘（二萬零八百二十噸）。日本造艦詳情，嚴守秘密，不得而知。但是，就所知者而論在已造與擬造中的，有戰鬥艦四艘，航空母艦二艘，輕巡洋艦五艘，驅逐艦九艘，潛水艇三艘。其中新建戰鬥艦，平均重的四萬噸左右。美國海軍專家相信，日本新建戰鬥艦的體積不但將破格增大，其已下水的，當有四艘甚至八艘。美國新建戰鬥艦中，有三萬五千噸的六艘四萬五千噸的兩艘。這些戰鬥艦比較現成的仟何戰鬥艦爲大，而且速度也快，戰鬥力也强。據紐的泰晤士報听載海軍總司令斯帶克談話，一九四一年度所造的戰鬥艦兩艘，或可達五萬二千噸，甚至五萬五千噸。美國戰鬥艦的噸位，因爲要受巴拿馬運河水閘一百十呎寬度所制限，現在只能造到道個最高度</p>
<p>日本的代管島，以前隸屬德國，佔着太平洋西南部廣闊的區域，計共包括巴琉羣島，馬利亞那羣島，加羅林羣島，麻紹爾羣島，其中共有島嶼一千四百個。但全部的面積不過八百二十九方哩，多半是毫無價値的珊瑚島，具有軍事價値的寥寥無幾。具有良港並已設防的只有特魯克島一處，另一個可能的或旣成的根據地就是在關島之北的賽般島。一九三九年，日本已開闢了一條航空綫，自橫濱通到該島，再從該島通到巴琉羣島。日木嚴禁外人往這些島嶼游歷，已有好幾年了；故眞相如何，知者殊鮮</p>
<p>美國在太平洋方面也在建造根據地。這些根據地完成之後、美國在太平洋的防綫將成一不規則的三角形，卽從阿拉斯加到夏威夷，從夏威夷到巴拿巴運河。</p>
<p>與這三角相輔而行的還有別的根據地，如中途島和威克羣島等，足以構成保衛夏威夷的前衛。至於夏威夷南部的島嶼，如的翰斯敦，柏爾邁拉，和坎呑，也可成爲夏威夷與巴拿巴運河區中間的屛障。再南便是美國屬島撒摩亞，尙未劃爲根據地，但可變成根據地。</p>
<p>先講阿拉斯加和阿留申區域。這一區域的根據地守衛着日美間大圓周的要道，這綫是橫渡太平洋的最捷徑。海軍當局已花費了八百五十七萬美金元，作爲經營該島的經費。睦軍部則擬撥款一千二百七十三萬四千美元改良該處根據地，但已被衆議院吾決。</p>
<p>從阿拉斯加向南前進，便到夏威夷。這裏，在阿湖島上，美國已將珍珠港闢成太平洋的直布羅陀，所花去的經費，至少有七萬萬美元。牠是美國僅次於巴拿馬運河的軍事要點。珍珠港備有潛水艇根據地，乾船塢，燃料和軍火倉庫，大規模的海軍站。足以容納美國全部艦隊，還有海軍飛機塲，所儲糧食足供五十天之用。附近還築有飛行塲多處。</p>
<p>最後講到巴拿馬運河。美國多數專家咸謂，由於距離遙遠的原故，巴拿馬運河可以避免太平洋方面的進攻。日本與巴拿馬運河，相距幾達八百哩。日本任何一艘航空艦若企圖轟毀巴拿馬運河，必遭遇到充分的防衛，因此日本的冒險不致成爲問題。</p>
<p>再講關島設防問題。關島位於子午綫一百八十度以外，面積凡二百五十方哩，有哥摩囉族土著二萬一千名，遠在美國太平洋利益內圍之外。它在火奴魯魯之西的三千三百哩，在馬尼拉之東一千五百哩，距橫濱的一千三百五十哩。因此，關島對日本的距離比較對美國的距離，更爲接近。除菲島外，關島可說是美國極西的領土了。惟關島四周爲日本代管各島的淺灘所包圍着。日本在賽般島的根據地，與關島相隔僅一百哩。</p>
<p>美國許多海軍專家主張將關島造成爲「太平洋的直布羅陀」，使成爲潛艇與飛機根據地。溫和派只要求花費五百萬美元，作爲挖深阿柏拉港，替水上飛機建築防浪堤和斜路的經費。關島在目前僅是太平洋航空綫的一個重要連鎖而已。</p>

<h3>金融述評－九月廿八日－</h3>
<p>— 聖凱</p>
<p>在九月中旬，由香港方面所傳出的消息，卽稱中美間有一筆巨額的借款成立。這一個消息在當時非但美國方面旣不吾認，亦不承認，就是中國經濟使節宋子文氏亦保持緘默。可是儘管那時在事實上無法證實，相反地却引起中外人士的注視，而日本方面允覺如芒刺在背，坐立不安。乃者，在日軍侵入越南，太平洋上危機快要走到爆發的尖端底前夜，中美新借款芷式由美國宣吿成立了。</p>
<p>據美國官方文吿：美政府以美金二千五百萬元借給中國，以維持中國外匯上的需要。另據經濟復興委員會主席瓊斯聲稱：對華新借款，將由半官性質的進出口銀行代理，直接貸與中國政府，由中央銀行擔保，債務則以售美之鎢價相抵銷；並稱美國決定向中國資源委員會購買價値美金三千萬元的鎢，以供美國國防上的需要。按此次美國進出口銀行對華貸款是第三次，前後共計貸華美金七千萬元。</p>
<p>這次二千五百萬元的借款，在數額講，雖不若前次所傳數額的巨大，可是在國際局勢中，侵略的與反侵略的陣綫顯然分野的時代，日本利用情勢以圖亟亟實現它的南進政策之際，美國忽續對華貸款，在美國本身方面說，足見美國對於遠東方面的關懷，遠東方面的現狀是不容許侵略者的任意變更，現在日本的侵入越南，非徒對緬甸·新加坡·荷印·菲律濱是一個有力的打擊，實在是美國在太平洋上的一種重大的威脅。所以美國積極援助中國抗戰，使日本爲對華戰爭所牽制，而小能在南太平洋極端的自由行動。不過中國在自力更生抗戰建國的過程中，其所期待於美國的援助正多，此次借款旣是以鎢値償債，因緬甸路的封鎖，中國目下實在無法將鎢運往美國。所以美國更應積極鼓勵英國在緬甸路祇封鎖三個月，而於十月十八日無條件地開放。不但美國本身可自中國源源取得國防上所需要的物資，中國方面亦可獲取美國方面的軍火及其他物品的接濟，以增强中國反侵略的力量，牽制日本在南太平洋上的行動。</p>
<p>中美新借款的成立，在政治上的觀點，已如前述。自金融上的觀點而論，則對於中國抗戰經濟究將發生如何的影響，筆者亦應指陳一些。按美官方文吿所稱是援助中國維持外匯上的需要，故數額雖小，但折合英鎊其數的爲六百餘萬鎊，較之二十八年中英平準基金數額計占五分之三强，其對於中國法幣匯價的維持，自勝過當時英國五百萬鎊所援助的力量。不過中國政府究將如何運用這二千五百萬美元的外匯基金，常然要看將來的事實，但是以筆者所觀察不出於下述兩途：一是加緊自由中國的經濟建設，一是穩定法幣黑匯市塲。　抗戰經濟建設所需要的資金可有兩種：一是對內所需用的法幣，一是對外所需用的外滙。前者目下由蔣委員長親自領導之下，正竭力推進節的建國儲金，所以資余的集積不生問題。但是開發礦產，創設輕重工業，興辦水利，發展交通等抗戰經濟建設，它所需用的機器物料工具，無一不需用外匯資金向國外購買，所以外匯資金的籌集，是一個很重要的問題，故中國爲推進抗戰經濟建設起見，這二千五百萬美元的借款是必需投資在機器物料工具的購置上。　（未完）</p>
<h3>金市多頭翻空</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、經上日之重漲、驟又回挫、乃以匯市鬆平、且加市面起伏不穩、足使一般人懷具戒心、反之拋空者逢高加碼、故本日六千一百二十元開盤後、雖於銀號幫搜買下、再晋達六千一百叫十二兀高價、但此後金號及浮多互相吐賣、且斯時匯市轉硬、立跌至六千〇九十元、後賴證券幫扒入會拉起二十元、卒因某銀號忽來拋空、散戶追跡力賣、加之收盤前證券幫多頭猛烈出籠、據聞已由多翻空、故曾退至六千〇六十五元、午收幸錢兌業拉提、遂吿六千〇七十五元、結果比上日軋跌四十五元、半天交易的四千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小十元、海關金等均平、</p>

<p>昌初市勢堅穩、開市抬起十元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲六千一百三十元、繼滙市微緊、目賴某銀號吃胃尙健、搜入三四百兩、故曾抬高至六千百四十二元、旋因匯市轉鬆、金號幫與銀號競賣、立跌數十元、銀號互做二十兩、退爲六千〇九十元、此後賴證券幫與散戶拉提、雖回升至六千一百十元、但因銀號幫傾向拋空、又跌至六千〇九十元、斯時金號及散戶等亦來跟賣、加之收盤前證券幫頭巨額出籠、再慘落至六千〇六十五元、而收盤賴某錢兌業買意陡濃、故結果遂吿六千〇七十五元、比上日軋跌四十五元、半天七十七元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數兀、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時未動、迨午刻掛小一元、計大同行改懸六百三十元、新同行與上價相仿、收　减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣大都回小</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤忽又趨跌、英美金鎊因亦一致回落一元、英金票需要雖稀、然持票人亦不願抑價傾售、故市價仍站原盤、美金票始因德義日三國巳訂立軍事及經濟同盟關保、　初曾高至十八元六角、嗣因黑市美匯步鬆、市價步落、卒爲十八元三角半、比上日軋跌一角三分、香港票回起一分、日金票供求相埒、市價站平、晚市仍爲一元四角九分、朝鮮票需要略殷、市價微漲、晚市高至一元一角九分、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨市復轉漲風、趨勢頗不堅俏、允以下午爲甚、隔日之回小、乃一般人以爲中美借款幷非收入現款、茲已證明專用以維持外滙借款、足證中美邦交之密切、德意日之同盟、無非舊事重提、不爲各界所重視、益足顯明其色厲內荏之象、是以公債前途已漸入康莊大道、加以游資充斥之推動、逢小買進、已爲市塲多數人之一種口號、偶爾察方壓迫、適爲多方造機會、昨日下午在各幫奮勇買進中、甲種穿出五元、乙種穿出八元、丙種逼近七元、丁種亦衝出五元關、戊種亦已達六元、丁種已超出九月十日高價而見新高價、買進者以六號需要爲殷、上下午吸收卅餘萬、聯和信孚同順鴻大樂茂恒康及怡泰均有相當需要、賣方同康爲多仁昌永康大通聯益及恒孚均有出脫、而市價則自晨至暮直綫飛騰、高低相差一元餘、結果一致回漲六七角至一元一角、成交總數共計的一百五十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股一百股、價爲六元九角、倫　外借等均無變動、</p>

<h3>紗花　投機集中　紗市易漲難跌　雙馬重出一千一百元關</h3>
<p>紗市續升、但實銷尙塲維持、故人心殊佳、一致看高、塲中籌碼稍枯、買者愈盛、所以市盤卽趨上升、但海外棉市仍弱、及外滙軟化、一般說者近來投機外滙黃金皆屬乏味、大家傾向雙馬進攻、因之紗市遂成易漲難跌之勢耳、</p>
<p>雙馬紗晨開人氣熱烈、大家自光望漲、因爲大戶頭心思良好、塲上籌碼被其吸收、關閉不出、首盤價爲一千〇九十五元、此價一開、買者蜂擁而來、檮面鋒俏、卽刻漲至一千一百十五元、旋聞外滙放長、金價不振、浮多吐出、跌至一千〇九十七元、少頃至收盤時、忽然上升至一千一百〇七元、以後又做至一千一百十二元、查半日間成交統計四千〇五十五包、行情漲二十七元、今日有紗一千四百十五件、運往香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行三、二〇雲南四〇〇統計」、〇五五香港　六一五寗波一〇</p>
<h3>現貨成交轉旺　棉價看高</h3>
<p>現棉交易雖未見大量的起色、但人心因紗市良好、對於棉價亦看高也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因投機者之購買而漲、後因歐洲政治消息之不佳、及現貨商之賣出、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落十三四磅音、印度連同預測跌四羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來交易又趨活躣、蓋因洋行方面以德日義之協定、恐怖事件之增多、訂購洋花、需將貨款全部付訖、故各方俱不欲訂購、同業則轉向現貨方面活躍、日來現貨成交者甚夥也、預測將來現貨、更將活躍也、</p>
<h3>雜項　燭皂火柴　又是無一不高漲</h3>
<p>火柴市價緊俏、盛傳亦將增加統、行盤並照聯營社日金計算之說、廠貨所派不多、同業增厚存底、向市塲搜羅、故市勢轉緊、昨開美麗牌二百五十五元、鳳凰牌二百五十三元、雜牌二百〇一元、</p>
<p>肥皂同業及囤戶、見各物上漲、故囤風重行踴躍、市况頓感熱鬧、價見上升、昨如固本皂二十二元四角、祥茂皂十六元、白祥茂二十元零八角、</p>
<p>洋臘燭連日市上謠言紛紛、傳水電罷工風潮、因存貨極缺、其價亦俏、昨售船牌十八元四角、鷄牌十八元、雜牌爲十六元、（坤）</p>
<h3>疋頭　星洲暢辦棉布　廠盤步開步高</h3>
<p>國布　昨市趨勢堅昂、廠盤步開步高、同業及本街批發號奮力吸收、交易激增、售盤白貨粗細斜紋每疋漲二角半至五角、漂染布每疋亦多數漲一三角之譜、印花貨平平、木街成交坯布色布粗布等一千數百件、北路烟台幫辦粗布羢布嗶嘰等二百餘件、粤港幫辦斜紋色布二三百件、浙閩幫辦色布色斜等近二百件、國外星加坡等地辦色布漂斜色卡其等五千餘疋</p>
<p>東布　客路烟台天津進胃暢旺、本街人心亦好、售盤乃逐步升騰、龍頭細布上午爲三十四元一二角、下午市塲賣出少而買進者多、情勢益挺、升至三十四元六角收盤、四君子嗶嘰售開每碼九角九分、</p>
<p>出口棉布今日有五百九十五件運往香港、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油步升元許　塲中大都皮球生意</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、在晨初開盤時趨勢平凡、交易亦少興奮、行情曾小回、但一般搶帽子之投機家、大踢皮球、此進彼出、市價因之漲跌倐忽、結果無甚上下、惟豆油依然堅硬、緊砌元譜、成交烟歧豆油五十件、價爲七十八元五角、靑島豆油一百桶、價爲二百零三四元、大有廠豆油三百担、價爲八十五元七角至八十七元、花生油做開膠州油二百件、價爲七十元至六十九元五角、十月上交五百件、價爲六十九元七角半、十月下交一千二百件、價爲七十一元至七十一元七角半、靑島豆油一百五十桶、價爲九十六元至九十七元五角、十月上交一百桶、價爲九十七元、十月下交五百桶、價爲九十八元至九十八元五角、</p>
<h3>絲茶紐約絲價上漲　本埠獨無生氣</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市忽告上漲、近期漲三分、遠期漲五分、現貨漲二分、一掃過去呆定作風、同時交易所成交額亦熱烈異常、計成交一六三〇担、（按過去一月日僅一二十担）而橫濱現貨祇漲十元、遠期下跌六元、良以太平洋風雲漸緊、日美縱不作軍事衝突、而在經濟領域中、其矛盾必將更見尖銳、美國廢鐵禁運以後、對日絲購買、恐亦有影響、是故紐約絲價有此報漲也、本埠交易、一無生氣、最近似難開展云、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵頗堅</h3>
<p>會司鐵交易、首推本街製罐廠、其次當屬玩具廠·印刷廠·及餅乾公司等、此外客幫如天津·烟台·等亦有不時搜羅、惟爲數已非昔比、故於此趨勢下、執貨者心思頗堅、兼之海外又無現貨裝來於行情一節、當步升無疑、暗盤較前回昂四五元、昨市喊價如老鋼廠貨每箱沽一百七十五元、新鋼廠貨每箱售一百六十五元、野鷄貨則喊價在一百二三十元至四五十元之間、而無一定之標準云、</p>

<h3>英商電車公共汽車　準今晨恢復行駛　虞洽卿調處得合理決　法商工潮亦卽開始談判</h3>
<p>公共租界英商上海電車公司·中國公共汽車公司·法租界法商電車公司工人先後罷工後、雖經各公司勞資雙方直接談判、未得圓滿之解決、以致公共租界電車公共汽車全停、法租界雖勉强由巡捕保護通車、發生極不幸之事件、租界市民、感受極度不便、自工部局華董虞洽卿·袁履登、得工人請求、允出任調處後、公共租界電車公司及公共汽車公司罷工風潮、已於昨日圓滿解決、兩公司工人準今晨一律復工、電軍公共汽車同時恢復行駛、法商電車公司工人提出改善待遇條件後、卽將由雙方直接談判、亦不難覓取解決之途徑、</p>
<p>電車工友全體復工虞洽卿氏出任調解</p>
<p>公共租界電車公司勞資雙方、因電車工潮相持已達一周、交通發生嚴重困難、故均抱從速解決之熱忱、雖經數次談判、均歸失敗、迨至前晚七時、電車工會四代表、晋謁虞洽卿氏、陳述工友目下生活之困苦、請予主持公道、處氏允卽出任調解、而資方亦表示願受外界之調解後、於是相持一周之工潮、遂急轉直下、</p>
<p>懇摯商洽歷時甚久</p>
<p>大中社記者探悉、昨日上午十一時、電車公司勞方代表四人、再度至五馬路航運俱樂部、謁見處洽卿、謂全體工友、對虞氏之出任調解、甚表贊同、對勞方所提復工先決條件、資万須予接受、虞氏允予轉告資方、至下午四時、電車工會接獲資方電話謂卽派代表來南蘇州路電車總公司談判、勞方遂卽派四人至總公司、虞氏及公共租界工部局工業科調解股顧炳元、亦均蒞止、由該公司總貿辦胡子輿代表資方、雙方各以和洽之態度、談判的二小時、始吿圓滿解決、</p>
<p>資方接受先決條件</p>
<p>茲將資方接受勞方所提之復工先決條件、記錄如下、（一）增加工資每日一角八分、津貼米貼一角七分、（自十月一日起）、（二）工人在業務上過失、仍照向例辦理、但決不開除罷工工人、（三）罷工期內、工資發給五天、（升工照給）（四）勞資互惠協的、由公司方面考慮談判、決於兩星期內解決、</p>
<p>全部電車今晨行駛</p>
<p>勞方於談判解決後、卽通知工友、準今晨一律復工、聞車務·機務·全體工人三千餘名、已遵令於今晨依照公司排定班期、前往復工、公司已派工匠查勘各路軌道、以便恢復有軌電車及無軌電車行駛、聞今晨起、所有公共租界一·二·三·四·五·六·七。八。九路有軌電車、及十四·十六·十七·十八·十九·二十·二十一·二十四路無軌電車、一律恢復行駛、惟在法租界法商電車公司罷工風潮未解決前、各路電車暫停駛入法租界、</p>
<p>虞氏熱望勞資合作</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏昨於調解公共汽車電車工潮完成後、會對大中社記者謂、英商公共汽車及電車工潮發生後、不獨雙方蒙受損失、且於整個社會治安不利、此事幸已獲得解決、但目下生活程度高漲情形未減、深望資方對勞方之生活、能予以顧及、在勞方亦宜體念資方營業前途、如實行勞資合作、則非特雙方衝突不致發生、卽無謂犧牲、亦可避免、實目前勞資間急切需要者也、</p>
<p>公共汽車今晨恢復　勞資調人會同談判</p>
<p>公共租界英商中國公共汽車工潮相持五日、勞方於前日下午二時、派代表向公司提出四項之先決條件後、昨日上午九時、勞方代表、特赴虞洽卿氏處、作一度會商、探討勞方眞實意見、繼卽由虞氏偕代表往南京路外灘沙遜大廈一百十一號公司總寫字間內、與公司代表開始談判、查勞方所提四項先決條件、爲（一）每日增加生活津貼五角、（二）罷工期內工資照給、（三）不得無故開除工人、（四）勞資互惠條的二十三條、於一星期內解決、</p>
<h3>米價與治安有關　壓制刻不容緩　國米昨達九十元新高峯　但銀根漸緊銷塲已呆頓</h3>
<p>米行茶會市塲賣、邇日暗盤猖熾、市况混亂異常、並謠言孔多、昨晨循例於七時半開做後、人心愈趨堅挺、秩序至爲混亂、一時漲勢沸騰、暗盤扶搖直上、市塲管理委昌卽採取緊急措置、加派人員往返市塲、監視同業買賣、如經發覺已成交米糧有不出立成交進出單者、卽作非法交易論、兩租界當局派駐市塲警探、亦嚴密注意市儈之無端造謠、而一般投機米蠧雖因多受的束、而仍交頭接耳、企圖猛抬市價、所謂「搶帽子」生意、層出不窮、</p>
<p>猛抬市價</p>
<p>顧市塲管理委員會此種措置、尙非壓平米價之有效辦法、市塲之暗盤等非法交易、該會負有賓任、兩租界當局對穩定整個米市、已議有具體辦法、惟切實執行、誠不容刻緩、昨晨市塲買賣結果、復較前做高二三元一石、國米已達九十元新高峯、較好米糧猶無法購得、號客等買戶、因市價扶搖直上、加以銀根漸緊、納胃已不若前之暢旺、</p>
<p>中外注視</p>
<p>米價之頻頻高漲、升斗小民顯已無法生活、攸關整個社會治安、不容忽視、邇日工潮之迭起、關係於米價之上騰、亦一大原因、夫一般薪水階級、按日所入、對於最低生活之用度、恐難應付、故滬市四百萬中外居民、莫不渴盼兩租界當局採取緊急措置、依法嚴懲投機米蠧、並强制執行米市塲買賣規則、及加派人員分駐市塲嚴密監視、一面飭　米糧評價委員會卽日恢復會務、再度評低標準市價、嚴厲執行、否則滬市整個米市將不堪設想、</p>
<p>存底充實</p>
<p>關於上海各米棧存底、極度充實、昨向上海米糧評價會探悉、該會自於上週四開始調查米棧存米、業於昨日竣事、並發表如下、共計存糧尙達六十萬包以上、以一石二斗半一包計算、約達七十五萬石左右、現本市每日食用僅及九千石、故僅就棧存一項而論、足够本市民食三月之需、茲該會業已分別報告兩租界當局曁有關各米業團體備查、况囤儲香港洋米、已在裝輪源源運滬應市、國米到滬者、亦日見增多、</p>
<p>訂米成交</p>
<p>平明社記者探悉、邇來外國轉鬆、已能與外國米價合通、故昨日米行同業、已先向建源洋行試訂二號西貢米一千噸、（合一萬包、每包八十元、合一百六十斤、業經成交、的下月中旬可抵滬、如星期一黑匯轉鬆、續有三千噸（三萬包）可望成交、</p>
<p>圓滿解決成立協定</p>
<p>此次談判之出席者計有部局華董虞洽卿·袁履登·兩氏、工業科調解股主任顧炳元、公司代表車務總管張德蘭·譯員胡毅孟·及工人代表（包括司機售票工務三部）等十二人、雙方開誠布公、以坦白態度、交換意見、縝密商討解決辦法、至下午六時、始圓滿解決、當卽成立協定如次、（一）全部工人每日每人增加生活津貼三角五分、（自九月一日起實行、）其他優待工人之米糧等均照舊、（二）罷工期內工資照給、（卽九月份工資全數發給、惟在電車罷工期內之四天雙工、則不另發給、）（三）非有重大過失、決不開除工人、（四）公司於九月五日答復勞方所提之勞資互惠條的廿三條意見、工人全部接受、</p>
<p>通知工友今晨復工</p>
<p>上項談判圓滿吿終後、勞方卽於當晚分別通知各部工人、於今晨一律恢復工作、界內公共汽車十一條路綫、卽可全部行駛、廿三條旣於昨日圓滿解決、此後勞資雙方、不再談判、相持五日之汽車工潮、至此遂吿全部解決、又悉此次工潮之得迅速順利解決、一則由於勞資雙方感情之融洽、皆能以誠意出之、其次租界當局及虞袁兩氏之奔走調停、亦爲消弭工潮之重要因素、</p>
<p>法商電車進行談判　推誠相見不難解決</p>
<p>法商常車公司工人、於本月二十五日罷工後、工人提出要求改善待遇條件十六條、已於日前推派代表、正式備函送達公司、今公司已譯成法文、由大班會同車務長麥希那逐條硏究、新聲社記者昨向工人方面探悉、勞資雙方、將於今日正式開始談判、惟時間尙未的定、並以今日爲星期日例假、故或將改明日星斯一談判、聞工人盼望公司接受工人要求、以免工潮拖延擴大、公司表示願意開誠佈公談判、所以法商水電公司工潮、亦不難解決、</p>
<p>勞方代表昨謁虞氏</p>
<p>法商水電公司之有軌無軌電車及公共汽車工潮、已達三日、資方損失總數已達十餘萬元、勞方爲謀迅速解決是項工潮起見、特於咋午、推派代表晋謁虞洽卿氏、申述勞方生活困難情形、要求予以調解、虞氏謂俟英商公共汽車電車調解完成後、再行進行、故法租界之交通工潮、日內當亦有開展之望、又悉昨日虞氏調解公共租界交通工潮自晨至暮、始吿完成、故法租界交通工潮之調解、需至今明兩日開始、</p>
<p>主要路綫照常維持</p>
<p>該公司爲維持界內公共交通、設法由武裝巡捕保護之下、勉强通車、雖不幸發生事件、致旅客無辜受傷、公司表示遺憾、惟爲整個交通着想、所以昨日仍由巡捕嚴密保護通車、計駛出二路十六舖至徐家滙、七路十六舖至善鐘路、十路十六舖至盧家　、總計三十輛、拖車不在其內、各電車站駐有華越巡捕、戒備允爲森嚴、惟各車行駛甚緩、以防不測、入晚並提早進廠、</p>

<p>四行孤軍謝晋元團長、於昨日午後二時、在新加坡路該營招待新聞界、發表此次事件之經過詳情、其結論包括四點、（一）此次事變、係一般輕視孤軍之觀念錯誤、但孤電爲中國革命軍人、決不惜任何犧牲、以維持軍人之尊嚴、（二）我等撤退、並非屈服、幽居此地、忍守秩序、所有用費、亦旣由政府供給、（三）解決現時環境壓迫、每多顧慮、無法提出任何條件、故對死傷同志萬分痛心除保留將來交涉外、今後決本政府主張、努力運動·敎育·工業等工作、備他日爲國效力、雖爲語無多、但用意良深、一腔剛毅勇氣、令人感佩、誠不愧爲近世模範軍人、</p>
<p>王班長墓</p>
<p>嗣親自引導參觀新近事件死難之王班長墓、上覆新鮮花圈一枚、士兵多名、在四週　築小圃、備形忙碌、嗣伴同記者至營房講堂運動塲等處、所見各士兵、或蹴足球、或投籃球、馳騁於塲中、雖面膚稍黑、然　　堅實、軀體健康、謝氏語人云、目提倡體育以來、各士兵身　　見康强、今年僅有九人車送醫院求治、可見運動之功效卓著、</p>
<p>努力生產</p>
<p>嗣導觀生產出品之各工塲、該營士兵除每日按時上課授課外、餘時另聘技師授各項小工藝、如織襪·籐工·駕駛汽車·及製造肥皂等、俾每人學習一技、所出品之肥皂綫襪、已暢銷於各學校、售價抵廉、貨品精美、深得一般購者所贊許、謝氏又云、本擬仿造牙膏、邇因成本過鉅、暫綏實行、未幾又步入合作社等多處、工兵均勤於工作、對於長官咸彬彬有禮、旋興辭而歸、</p>

<p>儲蓄機會</p>
<p>當局爲鼓勵國民參加起見、並已由四行聯合辦事處總處議決、增加儲蓄券利息、並嚴格規定節的儲蓄存款、僅供生產建設之用、滬市游資充斥、各銀行已感存款無法運用而實行减息、芷予滬土資金內移安全保障之機會、據悉、各界委託關係機關代購儲蓄劵儲蓄者、異常踴躍、</p>

<h3>大多數白狐僑民　不願違反法院協定　對移民會設仲裁法庭示不滿　民刑案應歸所在地法院管連轄</h3>
<p>字林報云、聞本市白俄移民委員會首腦伊凡諾夫、爲免僑滬白俄之司法上被轄權、從兩租界特區法院移歸他處、致發生糾葛起見、已與界外當局商妥、另設</p>
<p>仲裁法庭</p>
<p>審理白俄之一切民事案件、查有關當局、近已決定將此問白俄二萬六千人、置於他處法院管轄下、惟大多數白俄對此、均加反對、據白俄負責人士稱、此舉與法院協定相悖、必將引起</p>
<p>許多糾紛</p>
<p>華方民法刑法、皆規定須在民刑事案件發生區或當事人所屑區之法院、始有管轄當事人之權、設有一白俄寓居法租界、在公共租界犯案、而被移交他處審理、實屬</p>
<p>破壞刑法</p>
<p>再者、兩租界警務處將否以在其界內犯案之白俄、移交界外審理、亦成問題、而民事案件對白俄所處判決、實施時必有困難、故伊凡諾夫與界外方面縱商定成立仲裁法庭、由白俄自行判斷、然上海白俄在司法上之被轄權問題、仍未能解決、</p>

<p>主席袁履登致開會詞</p>
<p>袁君略謂、今天是上海兒童圖書館籌備委員會舉行成立典禮的日子、鄙人能够前來參加、實深感欣幸、查籌設上海兒童圖書館運動、是上海第九屆慶祝兒童節籌備委員會所發起的、而兒窒節籌備會之發起這個運動、又是根據於應純同、應純高兩位小朋友的建議、因此我們可以乾脆地說一句、「籌設上海兒童圖書館運動、實在是上海兒童自身所發起的、我們爲成人的、爲家長的、無非表示贊助、來努力推行、並且完成這個運動罷了、」上海兒童圖書館籌備委員會在今年四月四日就產生了、但因當時未舉行成立典禮、所以特地於今天補行成立典禮、當初組織這個籌備委員的份子、是中華慈幼協會上海辦事處·上海工部局兒童保障科·上海兒童保育會·上海街童敎育會等十一個團體、這十一個團體因爲覺感對於籌設兒童圖書館有聯合地方上多數同志、共同努力奮鬥的必要、所以在組織了這個籌備委員會之後、就立時選出胡祖蔭黃警頑·張國權·等幹事七人、請他們設法增聘八十餘位委員、並且仔細的擬訂了許多章程、然後再鄭重的敦請許多方面的同志來參加今天舉行的成立典禮、從此、我們可以明瞭、這十一個團體絕劉不願意包辦籌備兒童圖書館運動、因爲這是上海地方上的問、題所以他們要集合社會上各方面人士的力量來共同推進這個運動、今天來參加成立典禮的人士很多、我希望大家都能認識這個意思、熱烈的表示贊助、來共同努力、共同奮鬥、世界上當然沒有容易的事、然而我們要拿不畏難的精神、來克服一切的困難、談到設立兒童圖書館也許需要十五萬元、也許需要十萬元、或者至少需要五萬元·三萬元、然而在今日的上海局面下、對於籌款的困難這是大家十分明瞭的、可是上海的局勢雖如此、我們大家倒不必灰心、不必短氣、我相信只要大家肯努力奮鬥、一定能獲得相當的成就、我們募款的目標、原不必定得太大、我們縱然不能立時募到大批的捐款、來建造這美輪美奐的兒童圖書館、然而我們可以拿少數的款項、先從小規模辦起、然後逐漸的擴充、逐漸的改進、外國有句俗語、「羅馬不是一天造成的、」我們中國人也說、「登高必自卑、行遠必自邇」因此、我希望大家能努力向前、拋除一切的顧慮和担憂、從各方面努力、來完成籌設兒童圖書館運動、其他關於籌備工作的經過、因爲還有胡祖蔭先生來詳細報吿、所以我就不必多加贅述了、</p>
<p>胡祖蔭報告籌備經經過</p>

<h3>美國洋海軍完成期</h3>
<p>何謂兩洋海軍，簡單的說，美國海軍原來作戰計劃，只預備將全部艦隊集中在太平洋一方面，或者集中在大西洋一方面，維持國防。要在兩方面同時作戰，目前的實力却是不够。現今太平洋方面形勢日非，大西洋方面的英國海軍，正忙着對付德義兩國。英國艦隊萬一不支，美國豈非要在太平洋大西洋兩方面同時應付？上月間，美國國會因通過一種兩洋海軍案，決定按照現有海軍艦隊增加白分之七十。</p>
<p>美國現有的海軍，在表面看起來，其力量已可算是全世界最强大的了，（共一，三三〇，四一五噸，計有各種軍艦三百九十七艘）美國現役艦隊中，計有戰鬥艦十五艘，航空母艦六艘，巡洋艦一十七艘，驅逐艦二百三十七艘，潛水艇一百零二艘，戰鬥機一千三百餘架。英國海軍，據最近報吿，噸數共一，二五三，七四四噸，艦數共三百三十六艘，均不及美國。世界第三海軍國日本共有軍艦二百四十一艘，共計九六一，三二六噸。日本義大利及德國三者的海軍合併起來，較美國超過四〇九，三二三噸。這不過是表面文章，日本秘密建造的軍艦，數量和速率究竟如何，實在沒有人知道。英國的海軍是吾將被敵人所擊毀，如果如此，將在何時，這都在未知之天。美國現有的－五艘戰鬥艦，可說全世界任何國海軍中力量最大的了。但是它們的艦齡平均已屆二十三歲。其中三艘年齡過大，國會已撥款改良其大砲及鋼甲。二白三十七艘的驅逐艦中，亦有一百零九艘爲上次大戰的「遺老一，最近始重新編人艦隊。巡洋艦與航空母艦的數目，美國較之英日兩國，不及遠甚</p>
<p>至於美國建造中的新艦，的可分爲三類：（一）業已打樣定造的，（二）已在船塢中開工建造的，（三）已在裝配中的，就是艦身已經下水，正在裝配鋼甲及其他設備。如以完成的年份計算，則新艦數目如下：</p>
<p>一九四四年－戰鬥艦二艘，巡洋艦七艘，航空母艦三艘（一九四五年更有一艘）。</p>
<p>八月中，美國國會所通過的兩洋海軍案，比之原有的和計劃中的艦隊，要增加白分之七十（一，三二五，〇〇〇〇噸）。這個新計劃完成之後，美國將擁有世界無敵的海軍，對象便是在太平洋大西洋同時應付敵人。屆時美國的海軍將有飛機一千五百架，戰鬥艦三十五艘（其中數艘爲四出五千噸超級戰鬥艦）。航空母艦二十艘，巡洋艦八十八艘，驅逐艦三百七十八艘，潛艇一百八十艘</p>
<p>目下美國各大船塢中，早已忙着趕造，但是美國人非常心急，很不耐煩似的間道，這個紙上的艦隊何時纔能見諸事實，而在海面上飄浮呢？當然美國的造艦計劃決不能在三兩個月之內完成。但是據羅炳遜和馬里爾兩位海軍少將說，如果美國集中心思，人力利金錢三者努力造艦，也須至一九四六年或一九叫七年，始得全部完成。</p>
<p>在心急的「陸地漢」看來，這造艦計劃簡實是遲緩得無可再慢的了。其實在內行人知道這種艱鉅工作者看來，已可說是開足速率在那裏迎頭趕上去了。海軍部幾個船塢（像布羅克林，朴資茅斯，諾福克，布士頓，梅亞島，却爾頓登，費拉特爾費亞，和潘琪桑帕等）是早已日夜趕工。私家船塢（像紐堡紐絲造船廠，百里恒，百斯鋼鐵廠，聯邦造船廠，紐的造船公司，及電船公司等）也有幾家非常忙碌的在那裏製造新艦。三家專製鋼版的大廠（像白里恒，美國鋼廠，和鮑爾溫公司等）業已全部加工鍊鋼了。海軍部在却爾斯頓地方所設鋼版廠去年起已加倍出產，本年並將冉增加一倍。其他與造艦有關的各廠也正在計劃如何增進他們的生產量。總之，美國人都希望擴軍計劃早日實現，這是上分明顯的事實。</p>
<p>美總統羅斯福和海軍部長諾克斯也都是眼把把希望造艦計劃得以早日完成的人。費拉特爾費亞一個已經歇閉的克蘭潑船廠（第一次大戰時曾造成艦船多艘）已經在計議重開之中。其他谷地的造船廠，如吉吉德，樂士安極立斯，西雅圖，舊金山，鮑蒙，湯姆派，伯明罕，哇克蘭，惠爾明登等處，均經接洽就緒，卽可開工。諾克斯　已與勞工國防委員喜爾門商洽，將內地失業的技術人咒送至海岸一帶工作。各船塢工作時間和工資均已增加。</p>
<p>據海軍部長諾克期與海軍參謀畏斯泰克官布，美國海軍所造新艦，包括兩洋海軍在內，可望較原定時間提早二三年，卽在一九四叫年全部完成。這在美國人方面眞是個好消息，然軍界中人允希望在下次海戰發生之前，全部新艦能以加入作戰。</p>
<h3>英吉利海峽的巡視</h3>
<p>上月十七日，美記者隨德軍在相對英倫之法國海岸視察三日，所覩現象，足證希特勒　攻英國，已準備就緒，一俟時機到來，卽將再度作驚人行動，特表面上尙少德軍瞬將侵英之微象耳。許多人皆信希特勒有侵英之意，德方報紙對此亦不諱言。顧德軍在法國海岸一帶之僞裝工作殊極巧妙，若非仔細觀察，固不致想像侵英計劃已在佈置中也。就種種現象觀之，希特勒準備工作，有條不紊，週密異常，可不受風向，氣候與季節之影響，而隨意擇時發動。</p>
<p>英國飛機入夜輒飛法國海岸，盡力阻擾德軍此種準備工作。在白晝，則英吉利海峽中已無曩時往來如梭之舟楫矣。記者沿海岸驅車往來奧斯當與波洛業兩港者凡三日，海峽中絕未見英方護航艦與巨船，僅德方掃雷艦二艘，及小漁船一葉俏然前駛而已。奧斯常，加萊，與鄧扣克等港中輪船烟突之透露水面者，船隻之欄淺海灘者，比比皆是，令人憶及當時戰况之烈矣。</p>
<p>海峽上空則頗活動。飛機翱翔飛過，絡繹小絕。恒見德方梅塞斯密特式驅逐機高飛而過，疾如流星。槍火熾烈之戰鬥機及最重轟炸機隊，滿載巨彈軋軋向英倫西飛。德機編隊，分九架，十八架，廿七架，多至五十餘架不等，翱翔高空，入雲隱去，俄頃飛返，如銀魚破藍空而過，裝彈再出轟炸</p>
<p>在法國海岸方面唯遙聞連續爆炸聲及英方高射砲聲。半小時後，德機飛返，或隊形完整，或零落不齊。偶亦有央驅逐機緊隨轟炸機追擊不捨者，互　猛烈掃射，德戰鬥機亦突然出現，攻擊央機，不數分鐘，惡　告畢。</p>
<p>據記者視察海岸一帶所得印象，德方目已重重設防，以防　方反攻。</p>
<h3>特戈爾將軍</h3>

<h3>生活中求學識</h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>普通一般人以爲進學校才是求學識，有的小朋友也以爲拿了一本書讀着才是求學識，所以除了敎師逼着要做算術，寫大小字，背書外，其餘的事不聞不問，這都不是我們求學的正當態度，如果一個眞正求學的小朋友，他決不因敎師逼着才肯做功課，也不是只讀讀敎科書就好了。因爲書中的知識是有限的，是空泛的。時代是日新月異的改變着，做一個現代的小國民，這些學問是不够的。</p>
<p>所以我們除了在學校裏求到一些根本的學識外，還要在生活中去找尋，求得它的眞理；可是生活中的學識，範圍是頂大的，性質是多變化的，你如果時時的留意，那麽到處覺得是困難，是疑問，如果不去注意，那麼一無所知，一無所覺，糊糊塗塗的活在世上，如動植物一樣，僅得到書上的一些學識，到底有什麼用呢。</p>
<p>牛頓發明地心吸力，瓦特發明蒸汽及其他許多科學家，他們並不是個個有超越他人的智慧，也不是每個人受到高深的學識，他們就是從生活中的疑問，着手硏究，經過數年或數十年的埋頭苦幹，才能成功偉大的事業。</p>
<p>我們在學校中求學識，由敎師督促着，是被動的，在生活中求學識，就得我們自己去尋求。我略述其方法於下：</p>
<p>（一）隨時注意：我們對於生活中問題，微如螞蟻的構造，種類，合羣時，大至國際間鬥爭的原因背景，隨時隨地注意着。</p>
<p>（二）發問：遇到不能解決的問題，求敎師家長指導幫助，或和知己同學討論，以求得一正確的答案。</p>
<p>（三）細觀察：小朋友們大多喜歡捉昆蟲之類，據我平日的經騐，他們捉來並不會觀察，不過玩玩就算了，不要的時候，就丟掉，如果湊巧書上也購這昆蟲在臨考時就背着有幾隻眼，幾隻脚，背過也忘了，從不肯把眞的昆蟲看明白的。</p>
<p>（四）硏究：一物經過觀察後，就得硏究，爲什麽昆蟲的顏色大多是綠的，爲什麽螳螂有兩隻鉗，硏究出其究竟怎樣。</p>
<p>（五）證明學理；我們把研究過的和書中對照，是吾符合，書中說的是吾確實。</p>
<p>我們經過這一番的手續，不用再死記書中文字，此事的因果，此物的形狀，如在眼前。同時這種有條理的習慣養成後，以後無論求學辦事，便利得多了。小朋友們！我們快打好我們學識的根基，然後在生活中擴張充實以期達到最高的一點！</p>
<h3>談姿勢</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>坐有坐的姿勢，立有立的姿勢，讀書有讀書的姿勢，寫字有寫字的姿勢。總之，凡是一切行動都有一定的姿勢。姿勢不正非但會影饗身體的健康，同時對於精神方面或工作時的効率，亦是有一種相連的關係的。</p>
<p>「坐耍坐正，立要立直，寫字時背部不可彎曲……像這種類似的話，我想各位小朋友是早已聽得熱透了。那麽今天我爲什麼又要提出來呢？因爲世間愈普通的事就愈不知道實行，小朋友們是如此，大人亦然學。時代養成了不良的姿勢，將來入社會後是很難改除的。所以小朋友們應該有良好的姿勢是比大人們更爲重要。</p>
<p>有一本書上，把姿勢拿來與錶比喩：一隻錶，內部的器械雖然精良，若配上一隻凹凸歪斜的錶壳，卽不能準確守時。身體的器管也能因骨骼的姿勢不正而無從各盡職守』我希望你們能够把這個比喩記牢。現代的中國需要的是體格强健的兒童，而要有强健體格必須從養成良好的姿勢做起。</p>
<h3>猴子與胡桃</h3>
<p>— 芍農</p>
<p>有一天，一頭年輕的猴子在路上拾到一個胡桃，它立刻很快樂地把它放到嘴裏去，可是剛一咀嚼，立刻縐起了眉頭，覺得它的牙齒在痛着。於是帶咒帶駡的說道：「我的母親前天一定對我說謊，因爲伊曾說胡桃的味道是十分甘美的。我以後豈可再信任老年們的言語，他們時常哄騙年輕的。」說着隨手把這胡桃拋在路旁。</p>
<p>這時另一頭猴子，把這胡桃拾了起來，同時在二塊石頭之間，把它敲碎了，於是一面津津有味地吃着，一面對那年輕的猴子說道：「我親愛的同伴，你的母親是說得十分對的，胡桃確是十分甘美的，但必須要把它剖開吧了。你須牢牢記着我們在世界上，不作工作是決不能得到快樂的。</p>
<h3>典型兒童</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>不怕吃苦的兒童，是好兒童，能耐勞的學生，纔是好學生，筆者見到孤島上許多中小學生們，在電車和公共汽車罷工的時期裏，依然貪圖享受，喊人力車或野雞包車代步，無論那般車夫們仰天討價的七角，八角，一元，的亂喊，學生們揮霍父兄的汗血金錢，是滿不在乎的。要知道步行是鍛鍊體魄，活潑筋骨的唯一法門，不能忍暫時之勞，將來服務社會，還有什麽出息？</p>
<p>筆者又讀到冰騫君的「又是秋季開學時」的一篇佳作，內有關於小學生的一段，他說……國際風雲，是這樣的緊急，舊恨新愁，交併而來，靑年的責任，自更形重大，暑假期中，我（冰騫自稱）回到蘇北去消夏，和許多靑年談談，覺得他們有不可抑制的朝氣和活力。一個年甫十四歲的學生，每天要走到十五里外的學校裏去讀書，從未遲到，以視海上靑年之頽廢，眞不可同日而語……」云云。這位小學生。眞可謂「典型兒童」了！又可以說是一位模範的好學生呢。小朋友們！讀後作何感想？</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（十六）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>呀！可甘，你要知道在福克斯這麼一個大攝影塲中工作，是何等的有趣啊！那天早上，爸爸上銀行去辦公時，總得把汽車帶我們前去。攝影塲的門口，有警察看守着，如今他們都已認識我了。但在我開始工作的時候，他們不知道我是誰，立時攔住了我問道：「你是誰？上那裏去？」當下媽媽回答道：「這是我們的女孩子秀蘭鄧波兒。今天伊在第八塲上「起立歡呼」影片中工作。這是伊的入門證。」於是他們就放我們進去了。</p>
<p>我們進了攝影塲上的一角，走過頂狹狹的橋，走到那一角，却已進了一個很好頑的老村子。村中的屋子　都像尋常的屋子一樣，是用棕褐色的石塊砌成的，屋頂是高而斜下的，上面有高高的小窗子和古怪的老式烟囱，郤並沒有烟冒出來。媽媽說這些都是法蘭西式，德意志式意大利式的屋子，並沒有人住在裏頭，不過是當作模型用的。但在攝影塲中純粹美國式的部分，郤有許多美麗的小屋子，可以住人的。有一天早上，媽媽指着一座屋子對我說道：「瞧啊！那是麗琳哈蕙的平屋可不是很美麗麼？」我抬眼瞧時，果然美麗得很，全部是藍色和玫瑰色的，兩面都是碧綠的草，有矮籬圍着，上面並沒有門牌的號數，是一個法蘭西文的名稱，我並不識得。據我的敎師白克蘭小姐對我說，它的意思是「夢屋」。我想這倒是一個很好的名稱。媽媽常常說，這裏也就是我的「夢屋」終於實現了我的夢想了。你道爲什麼？原來這座美麗的屋子現在是給我住下了。</p>
<p>那最初和我合作的大明星就是傑密滕思。我學了一支歌曲和一種舞蹈，和他在「起立歡呼」影片中一同演出。可是你和大明星合作，也不用害怕的，因爲他們也和平常人一模一樣。我們練習舞踏時，總得到體育中去；有時倘有成隊的舞女在那裏演習步子時，沒有餘多的地位了，那麽我們改到一個不在工作的舞台上去。媽媽往往陪伴着我，坐在一旁瞧着。有時我對伊瞧上一眼，伊就微微的露出笑容來。有時我倘跳錯了一個步子，伊只咯咯的搖一搖頭。我倘跳得高興，不肯休息時，俘怕我太疲乏，就得責備我；但我仍然不肯停止，除非傑密滕思喚我停止時，我纔肯依從。每一次我在拍攝新片以前練習歌舞或表演，或在正式開拍的時候，媽媽總是在一旁瞧着的。我實在也需要伊這樣，不願伊離開一步，覺得我可以放膽做去。要是伊不在旁邊，就覺得很寂寞，幾乎要放聲哭出來了。</p>
<p>在這「起立歡呼」一片中，有許多重要的明星，像華納白克斯德，的翰鮑爾士，梅琪伊文絲，傑密滕思一流人，叉有許多美貌的歌舞女郎，和年紀與我相同的男孩子小孩子，所以人家對於我並不注意，不像現在那麽大家注意於我了。但是後來把這片子在攝影塲的小電影院中試映時，希漢先生一瞧之下，郤止不起脫口喊起來道：「唉，那小女孩子竟把這片子偷了去了！」可甘，這句話，並不是說我眞的偷了片子，他的意思是說他們本來並不重視這個小小角色，誰知出於意外的，我竟是全片中表演最好的一個。</p>

<h3>賽嘉寶好大口氣</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>大凡一個藝人的下海，好比一個政客的上台，必有一番動人的道白，如果默不作聲，反證其人氣派不大，也就決無號召的力量。好萊塢雷電華影片公司，最近爲擴充演員連容，去蕪存菁，選拔英才起見，特地延聘瑞典女明星以一葛萊泰嘉寳第」二馳名的雪妮哈素（Signe　Hasso）加入。哈素出身於瑞典皇家戲劇學校，這學校彷彿是歐洲的「科班」，她很早就在舞台上享名，她的丈夫是一位導演，她的面孔父像嘉寳，自然格外令人注意了。</p>
<p>哈素走馬上任，向人談及從影的計劃，充滿很大的口氣，她道：「有許多人以爲處此亂離之世，娛樂事業大可以擱在一旁，這眞是井蛙之見，依我想，在這個戰爭的時代，像我們這般藝人，實有負起重大責任的必要，因爲娛樂不僅是娛和樂而已，它可以發揚民氣，振作精神。本人此去好萊塢，抱有三種條件：（一）不演無意識的影片，如色情片等，本人保留修改劇本的權利；（二）與本人合演的男角兒，不出却爾斯鮑育和詹姆士史都華兩人；（三）每年只能工作九個月，其他三月回祖國表演，以調劑個人的生活。」</p>
<h3>李綺年主演時裝片</h3>
<p>— 海鷗</p>
<p>「南國佳人」業已開拍</p>
<p>南國影后李綺年小姐到了上海以後，很得到廣大觀衆的歡迎，來滬共計二個半月，已完成了「女皇帝」和「梁紅玉」附部古裝片，當初李綺年和藝華的合同上，訂有拍攝時裝片的規定，所以雙方已準備履行拍時裝戲的諾言。</p>
<p>李綺年拍時裝戲，更能發揮多量的演戲技巧，雖然她沒有演過國語的時裝片，但是在粤語的時裝片中，她的演出是超越的成功了。</p>
<p>據有經騐的導演說：李綺年是最合宜於演時裝片的，藝華當局也很明瞭她的優點所在，擬大率重用，因此在編劇部方面，也就大動腦筋，爲李綺年編好大批時裝片的劇本。</p>
<p>在這些劇本中間有一部叫「南國佳人」的，是一個諷刺社會的悲劇，在各方面多合李綺年的個性。故事是叙述一個香港的交際花，在南國紅極一時，後來到上海來，受到社會惡勢力的磨折，其中一小部份，略同於「日出」中的小東西，不過「南國佳人」比較更現實而更生動。</p>
<p>「南國佳人」現在已經在藝會攝影塲開拍了，而李綺年的演出確乎不失衆望，　說有某戲院因將改演國片，已委人向藝華接洽首輪映權，足見時裝片已有抬頭的象徴。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>我跟着霍桑離開亞東踏上他的汽車的時候，心中感到一種難以形容的愉快和鬆爽。因爲這件案子逐步開展，連續着把三個嫌疑人——余甘棠，陸健笙，趙伯雄——一一收進了法網，這件疑案總可以吿一個段落；尤其是這趙伯雄的被拘，使我存着一種這案子有立卽結束的希望。因爲這三個人中間，他是嫌疑最大和最兇暴的一個。但瞧他曾開槍襲擊霍桑，也是一個顯然的證據。不料我的得意的情緒，在霍桑方面，却得不到任何反證。他將汽車開動以後，臉色很沉着，兩隻手把握在司機盤上，眼光注視着前路，臉上的肌肉也冷冰冰地緊張着。我仔細地檢視，却找不到一絲他內心裏鬆爽的反應。我禁不住暗暗詫異。因爲他這種神態，和我的期望完全是相反的。</p>
<p>一回，我耐不住問道：「霍桑，你看這案子怎麼樣？不是快結束了嗎？」</p>
<p>「還遠。」他的視綫依舊注視在街路的前向，語聲也很冷淡。</p>
<p>我作詫異聲說：「還遠？什麼意思？這個人難道還不是正兇嗎？」我見他瞧着駕駛盤不答，好像沒有聽得，又問道：「那末，你剛才在五五六號裹可曾搜得什麼？」</p>
<p>他又簡短地答道，「沒有什麽。你別多說，此刻很不容易駕駛。」</p>
<p>他所說的駕駛，當然是指汽車說的。這時恰當午膳時分——下寫字間的時間，街路上的確車如流水。他禁止我發言，好像就憑着多說話會分心肇禍的理由。其實我覺得這明明是託詞。他的駕駛術很精，在喧閙區域，他一壁駛車，一壁談笑，我經騐得已多。這時他把這個理由不許我發問，當然瞞不過我。奇怪，案子的情勢旣然步步順利，霍桑怎麽反而顯得更嚴重緊張呀？（一二一）</p>

<h3>Repercussions of the German-Italian-Japanese Alliance: The U.S. Expedites Aid to China and Britain; Welles Condemns Japan's Disruption of the Far East Status Quo; U.S. Prepared for Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>Washington – After reading the document of the new tripartite military agreement signed in Berlin by Germany, Italy, and Japan, President Roosevelt convened an emergency meeting of the entire cabinet here yesterday at 3:00 PM (4:00 AM this morning, Shanghai time). Out of caution, the President avoided discussing the matter of banning scrap iron exports, intending to sanction Japan. He only expressed doubt about reports that the U.S. would transport a large number of bombers to Britain. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the signing of the tripartite military agreement was expected. It was because of this consideration that Washington had taken actions such as lending $25,000,000 to China and banning the export of scrap iron to sanction Japan. Hull said, "According to the U.S.'s understanding, this military agreement does not substantially change the situation that has existed for several years. The announcement now merely clarifies the existing relationships. The signing of this agreement was anticipated, and the U.S. considered this point when deciding its foreign policy." Congress temporarily refused to criticize this military alliance, acknowledging that Japan's move would affect the U.S.'s future foreign policy but refraining from further comment. However, some anticipate more active developments between Britain and the U.S. in the near future. One Congressman said that Japan's adherence to the Rome-Berlin axis is entirely similar to the secret understanding between Italy and Germany before Italy joined the European war. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – Official circles here declared last night that the U.S. is not particularly disturbed by the establishment of the new pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and will continue to aid Britain in all ways short of war. The new German-Italian-Japanese pact merely crystallizes a situation that was already evident but not formally confirmed. As far as can be seen, the U.S. will continue to maintain its current attitude toward the Far Eastern situation and insist on maintaining the status quo. Since the talk of a German-Italian-Japanese alliance in 1937, U.S. policy has recognized the three countries as potential allies. This is the reason for the expansion of the U.S. Navy. The current pact is a declaration to the American people that the European war is not an event unrelated to others, but part of a global act of aggression. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio – U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech to the Foreign Affairs Council today, reiterating the U.S.'s intention to provide Britain with all material assistance. It is said that any problems in the Far East can be resolved peacefully through negotiation, but the U.S. government is prepared for any eventuality. Given the new pact between the Axis powers and Japan, this speech is considered to have special significance. He also condemned Japan's attack on Vietnam as a threat to the integrity of French colonies, in violation of the Japanese government's promise to respect the status quo. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – The U.S. government will provide greater assistance to nations fighting totalitarian countries in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres to counter the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Secretary of State Hull clearly stated last night that the response to the Axis powers' intimidation of the U.S. will be increased arms exports to Britain, increased moral and material assistance to China, and increased economic pressure on Japan. (International News Service, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – Following the emergency meeting of the entire cabinet convened by President Roosevelt yesterday afternoon, it is believed here that the U.S. will further assist Britain in response to the recent establishment of the tripartite military agreement between Japan and other countries. The President was unusually busy yesterday, holding important consultations with government leaders at the White House, but the outcome of the consultations has not been officially stated. British Ambassador Lothian and the editor of the London Economist both went to the White House to consult with the President for fifteen minutes. The main topic of discussion was increasing U.S. aid to Britain. It is said that members of the British diplomatic community are urging the President, and a non-official U.S. delegation has also expressed support for increased aid and requested the President to implement it. It is reported that Roosevelt has accepted. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – According to political figures close to the White House here, after implementing the embargo on iron scrap to Japan, the U.S. will take further retaliatory measures to prevent Japan's further actions in Asia. It is expected that the step following the iron scrap embargo will be a gasoline embargo. Political figures continued to say that the ultimate goal of the U.S. will be to completely halt trade relations between the U.S. and Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>U.S. Warships Sail to the Philippines</p>
<p>Honolulu – Unofficial sources here claimed last night that part of the U.S. fleet left Honolulu last week for the Philippines. Other fleets, including an aircraft carrier, may leave Hawaii for the Philippines at any time. It is believed here that the reason the Navy ordered an aircraft carrier to the Philippines is to show Washington's intention to strengthen the "flying destroyer" long-range bomber capabilities in the Philippines. Some speculate that the dispatch of multiple warships to the Philippines is a routine deployment, but the large number of warships sufficiently demonstrates that the U.S. naval strength in the Far East has been greatly enhanced. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – The Navy Department announced last night that the signing of the tripartite military agreement yesterday has significantly changed the world situation, so the U.S. fleet's plan to sail from Hawaii to the mainland must also be changed. Whether these warships will still return to Hawaii has not been definitively stated by the Navy Department. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – Political circles here claim that the U.S. will continue to oppose Japan's demands or threats, whether they concern American interests in Shanghai or other parts of China, or areas that the U.S. has declared must maintain the original status quo and must not be forcibly changed under threat of force, such as the Dutch East Indies. The U.S. government and most members of Congress believe that the formal alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan only draws public attention to a situation that has long existed, and which the U.S. had fully considered when formulating its national defense policy in early 1938. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement after meeting with the President, stating that the German-Italian-Japanese alliance has not substantially changed the situation. Officials said that the U.S. had taken into account the close collusion between Germany, Italy, and Japan when formulating Pan-American policy, which is tantamount to declaring that the U.S. will continue to adopt the same policy. The U.S. government does not want to succumb to Japan's threats, especially since these threats appear to stem from a weak rather than a strong position. In other words, the conclusion of this treaty is largely due to Germany's failure to conquer Britain and Japan's failure in China. Tokyo and Berlin feel the need to boost morale at home. In reality, Germany and Japan are not in a position to help each other. As for the idea that Japan can seize the Dutch East Indies or British Malaya to obtain raw materials such as rubber, oil, and tin, it is not worth taking seriously. Japan is unwilling to fight against first-rate powers. It is said that one thing that could make U.S. public opinion support drastic action is the U.S. openly acting where its vital interests are deemed to be threatened. Japan's actions that disregard international law and morality may not be enough to stir up public opinion, but Japan completely disregards the U.S.'s wishes and directly endangers the U.S.'s interests. Japan is cooperating with Germany and Italy to establish and maintain a new order, but mutual assistance between Germany, Italy, and Japan will only be realized when a country not currently involved in the war attacks one of the contracting parties. This vague formulation seems to only concern Japan when a third country, such as the U.S., joins the war. However, it is unknown whether this treaty will apply when Egypt is at war with Italy. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London – The current view here is that the attempt by the Rome-Berlin axis to woo Spain after forming an alliance with Japan indicates that Germany's current war situation will continue for a long time. At the same time, the blitz tactics against Britain have failed, so German leader Hitler is eager to find new allies. British commentators believe that the only thing Germany can gain from Japan's joining the Berlin-Rome axis is propaganda value. A British official said, "As I see it, Japan has joined an alliance that is of no benefit to it and is likely to invite a task that it cannot handle on its own." All sectors in Britain believe that this new alliance is a clamorous "threat" to the U.S. The first reaction to the treaty last night was that it was only an empty intimidation. As far as informed circles know, the British believe that it cannot affect the general situation at present. Furthermore, Germany and Italy will absolutely not be able to take stronger action against Britain with Japan's help. In private, the British government is not at all surprised by this move. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>London – London's newspapers unanimously mocked the tripartite alliance. The "Daily Mail" said that the alliance is similar to the previous Anti-Comintern Pact and is not at all frightening. However, the current tripartite alliance no longer opposes Bolshevism. Their current common goal is to build a "new order" in Europe and Asia. The newspaper also said that it is obvious that this alliance is aimed at the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union may be interested in one thing: that the relationship between the three allied countries and the Soviet Union will not undergo major changes. However, it should feel that, in any case, the intention of this treaty is to "freeze out" the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th) benefits, then U.S. public opinion may not forgive it. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>New York – New York newspapers recently published news of the German-Italian-Japanese Berlin agreement in large headlines and prominent positions, regarding this military alliance as an anti-U.S. action. All newspapers believe that this new alliance is an attempt by totalitarian states to prevent the U.S. from participating in the European war or to force the U.S. to cope with wars on both the Eastern and Western fronts simultaneously. The first commentary on this new agreement was an editorial in the New York Sun. The newspaper said that the alliance is clearly a warning to the U.S. not to interfere in the wars currently taking place in other parts of the world. The newspaper also said that the Berlin agreement is a sharp response to President Roosevelt's announced steel embargo aimed at Japan. The signatory countries of this new agreement have at least indicated that they do not want to offend the Soviet Union at this time. The newspaper also said that the jubilation of Spanish newspapers about this agreement shows that, regardless of whether Spain joins this agreement, the Spanish government approves of this alliance of dictatorial countries. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent commented on the new treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, saying that Japan can be said to have been dragged into a treaty that instead of helping itself, makes it solely responsible for difficult tasks. Germany and Italy are currently exerting all their efforts to</p>
<p>Britain Believes Japan Is Trapped and Will Not Affect the European War</p>
<p>attack Britain, and cannot supply Japan with its raw materials or other goods, while Japan must instead contribute to Germany and Italy. One of the clauses of the treaty is clearly aimed at the U.S. The main purpose of this treaty is nothing more than to keep the U.S. out of the war. The special reservation regarding the Soviet Union seems to indicate that the signatory countries are not concerned about the Soviet Union. Judging from the full text of the published treaty, the situation will not undergo major changes as a result. If there are no secret clauses, this treaty should have no impact on the war between Britain and the Axis powers. This treaty merely declares Japan's state of belligerency rather than neutrality.</p>
<h3>The Tripartite Agreement Cannot Shake China's Determination to Resist Japan; It Will Instead Facilitate a Stronger Democratic Front; The Chinese Government Will Issue a Formal Statement</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Official sources here recently stated that the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese military and economic alliance is not surprising, and that it cannot shake China's determination to resist Japan and achieve final victory in the slightest. Officials also said that China can definitely obtain substantial assistance from the Soviet Union. This agreement will not be as bad for China as generally imagined, because it can enable democratic countries to form a strong united front and can enable China to obtain more active assistance from Britain and the U.S. Officials also said that the Chinese government recognizes the Soviet Union as a neutral party between democratic and totalitarian countries, so its assistance to China will not be affected. Authoritative observers say that Britain and the U.S. may adopt a stronger Far Eastern policy than before as a result. The Ta Kung Pao, in an editorial summarizing the contents of the agreement, said that the agreement is nothing more than (1) mutually recognizing the "new order in Europe and Asia," causing Germany and Italy to adopt a hostile attitude towards China, (2) the "non-participating country" mentioned in the agreement clearly refers to the U.S., because the U.S. is forcibly considered an ideal enemy, and (3) specifically mentioning the Soviet Union to keep the Soviet Union neutral. These three points are enough to show that a war between the U.S. and Japan is about to break out. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the signing of the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is reported that the Chinese government is likely to issue a formal statement tonight to clarify China's position on this alliance. In addition, how China's diplomatic representatives in Germany and Italy will be handled in the future is also under consideration by the authorities. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<h3>An Analytical View of the Tripartite Pact</h3>
<p>The military, political, and economic alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan was formally signed in Berlin the other day. This is a major international event today, but it is definitely not an unexpected or accidental event. It has been brewing for a long time, with repeated observations and repeated setbacks, until recently, when it was finally necessary to make a decision and complete the procedure. This is not creating a new situation, but rather bringing a phase to a close. After Japan joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, there was already a proposal for a further alliance at that time. In the past, Germany and Italy had repeatedly urged Japan to accept this proposal, but Japan hesitated. Germany and Italy then set Japan aside and concluded the so-called "Steel Pact" between the two countries. As time passed, the situation became difficult. Japan suffered diplomatic setbacks everywhere, except for sharing a morsel of Vietnam from the mouths of Germany and Italy. Germany's blitz tactics also failed to achieve success in one go, and the European war, following the Far Eastern war, became a frozen situation. The attitude of the U.S. was repeatedly tested and proved to be firm. In short, the facts show that the strategy of quick victory and quick decision of both Germany and Japan has achieved the opposite result. Thus, the two opposites combined, abandoning their respective sneaky tactics and returning to the path of jointly pulling the ox. For two years, everyone has seen through that this is an inevitable trend, but under the consciousness of settling matters, it is inevitable to hope that it will not be so. Therefore, the eventual realization of the tripartite alliance is definitely not unexpected. This is the first point worth pointing out.</p>
<p>The sparks in Liaoning were not extinguished in time, and the war spread like wildfire, eventually involving the whole world, almost becoming the world long ago. It was destined. The establishment of the tripartite alliance only proves the inevitability of a world war and explains that the great war is getting closer and closer. However, it does not mean that the great war will start here. Now it is only a prelude to the great war. In other words, in the near future, the European war will still be the European war, and the Far Eastern war will still be the Far Eastern war. For a time, they will not be mixed into one. The reason is that the nature of the tripartite alliance is passive rather than active. It is an empty shell rather than an explosive. Its most important provision regarding so-called mutual assistance can only be invoked after a third country has joined the European war or the Far Eastern war. Even in terms of mutual assistance, apart from echoing from afar and shouting in unison, there is actually no way to devote efforts to each other, and the solution to Vietnam is the most wonderful exception that is not within the alliance. This is the second point worth pointing out.</p>
<p>There are six articles in the alliance treaty, which is very simple. The first article is "wishful thinking," and the second article is "calculation." How will Germany lead Britain? How will Japan lead China? Anyway, they have already broken off relations and are at war. Let's just write a few articles of the alliance to take advantage of the paper. It can also be considered a moment of pleasure, and it is not necessary to discuss it. However, Europe is not just Britain, and Asia is not just China. According to reports, Spain will join the German-Italian axis. According to the first article of the alliance, Japan must recognize and respect Germany's leadership of Spain. Can it not ask General Franco what he thinks? As for the so-called Greater East Asia, according to Japanese sources, the scope extends as far as the Dutch East Indies. How the Dutch East Indies will accept leadership is a question that is not discussed for the time being. However, between China and the Dutch East Indies, there is also the Philippines. The alliance forgot to list it as an exception. According to the second article of the alliance, Germany and Italy must of course recognize and respect Japan's right to lead it. However, when they signed the agreement, they forgot to tell the U.S. to sign a word as well. Countries like Turkey, which straddle Europe and Asia, unlike the Soviet Union, which is granted special treatment by explicit provisions, should probably flatter both sides and accept leadership from both sides!</p>
<p>The third article of the alliance is the most intimidating, stipulating that "if one of the signatory countries is attacked by a country that is not yet involved in the European war or the Far Eastern war, the three countries shall provide mutual assistance in the political, economic, and military spheres." On the surface, this article is the most important, that is, the so-called alliance. However, upon further review, one can realize its true meaning: First, this article is equivalent to declaring that the European war and the Far Eastern war are two completely separate matters. Assuming that the current situation changes slightly, Japan still maintains a policy of non-intervention in the European war, and Germany and Italy do not help Japan invade China in the Far Eastern war. Therefore, the essence of this article is only to prevent a third country from standing on the side of Britain or China and participating in the war. The so-called third country here, of course, primarily refers to the U.S. (although the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Greece also have the possibility of being regarded as targets). However, even in the case of the U.S., the problem is not simple. The so-called "being attacked" must have a clear explanation in terms of degree. For example, does the U.S. continuing to supply Britain with airplanes and warships count as attacking Germany and Italy? Second, assuming that the situation truly meets the conditions for applying Article 3, how can the three countries truly "provide mutual assistance in the political, economic, and military spheres?" These seem to be practical technical issues. Examining the reality, they have already fought with all their strength on their own. How can they still help each other? Assuming that the U.S. assumes the defense of Singapore and Hong Kong on behalf of Britain, and all of Britain's military equipment in East Asia is transferred to Europe to fight Germany and Italy, what do you ask Germany and Italy to do with Japan? And what can Japan do? What dare it do? If Japan is willing to send warships to the Atlantic or the Mediterranean to assist in the war, honestly, the three countries would have formed an alliance long ago, without waiting until today. If the U.S. takes further action in East Asia based on Singapore and Hong Kong, what can Germany and Italy do to help Japan? Therefore, the third article of the alliance seems very serious at first glance, but it is actually very hollow upon closer examination. Germany is still just Germany, and Japan is still just Japan. One plus one divided by two is still equal to one. It has not added a single point. As for the fifth article of the alliance, the so-called tripartite alliance does not affect the Soviet Union. This can be compared with the Anti-Comintern Pact, which the three countries have not declared abolished. They regard the white bear as a silly bird, and the big white bear can also pretend to be stupid for the time being. The sixth article of the alliance stipulates a valid period of ten years. It is a stock phrase in the articles, a prayer of the "long life and wealth" type. In today's world where all treaties can be torn up at will, it is appropriate not to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not think that this tripartite alliance is a joke. Although the tripartite alliance is not accidental, and not a creation, it marks the end of a chaotic two years and the end of a phase. After this phase, we shall see a clear and firm development in the international situation. The causes and consequences will be discussed further.</p>
<h3>German, Italian, and Japanese Foreign Ministers Converse: Matsuoka to Visit Berlin and Rome; Alleged Xinjiang Border Issue to Be Submitted for Discussion; Japanese Side Claims No Change in Non-Interference Policy for Now</h3>
<p>Berlin: Following the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact, Ribbentrop, Ciano, and Matsuoka Yosuke communicated with each other via wireless. The German Foreign Minister stated to the Japanese Foreign Minister: "The German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact has been signed and established by your country's ambassador, Oshima, Ciano, and my plenipotentiary representatives on behalf of the three governments, taking immediate effect. I am exceedingly pleased. This historically significant action sufficiently demonstrates the friendly relations and common interests of the three countries. The success of this pact is entirely due to your efforts, for which I am deeply grateful. I believe this pact will surely benefit the people of the three countries, prevent factors that prolong the war, and restore peace as soon as possible. I believe you share the same sentiment. Because of the long distance, you were unable to come to Berlin to participate in the grand occasion, which Ciano and I deeply regret. We earnestly hope that you can come to visit Berlin and Rome as soon as possible, for which both countries wholeheartedly welcome you." The Italian Foreign Minister Ciano stated to Matsuoka Yosuke, "At this important juncture, I have come to Berlin to sign the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact with the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and your country's ambassador to Germany, Oshima. This action realizes the wishes of the Italian Prime Minister and promotes the connection between the three countries. I am extremely honored to be able to participate in this grand event. I believe that this pact will be greatly beneficial to the future world history. Please convey my friendship and admiration for your country to all levels of your government." Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke then answered, expressing satisfaction with the Tripartite Pact, and asked the German Foreign Minister to convey the congratulations of the Japanese government to the German head of state and the German government, and promised to visit Berlin as soon as possible. He then asked the German Foreign Minister to convey his thanks to the Italian Foreign Minister, informing him that he would definitely visit Rome when he visits Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Authoritative sources here declared at a gathering for foreign journalists that the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact has no mission to adopt a new attitude towards American policy. Regarding the question of whether this pact is a warning to the United States, the reply was that if the German government's statement on the pact had mentioned certain individuals in democratic countries attempting to prolong the war and obstruct the true interests of various countries, this could indeed be found in the United States. If one could pay a little attention to certain parts of the administration in the United States today, without criticizing American policy, one could find that most of these people wish to plunge the world into war. This is their characteristic. The German authoritative source continued that the question of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a concept of political dynamics and is only related to Japanese policy. As for the boundary issues of the new order that will occur, they will be submitted for discussion and decided at the appropriate time. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Berlin authorities believed last night that this new tripartite alliance is an "application of Japan's new policy." The first action of this new policy was Japan's invasion of Vietnam. Authoritative circles declared that the German Foreign Minister's speech yesterday stated that "warmongers" can mostly be found in the United States. Authoritative circles issued this statement because someone had asked whether the new agreement was directed at the United States. Berlin authorities also pointed out that Japan's southward policy can alleviate pressure on the Soviet Union. Therefore, this new alliance cannot be regarded as aimed at the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: On the day the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact was signed, the German head of state sent telegrams to the Italian King, the Italian Prime Minister, and the Japanese Emperor to express his regards. The German Foreign Minister also sent a telegram to the Japanese Prime Minister Konoe to express his delight. Furthermore, Hitler awarded the Grand Cross of the German Eagle to the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima. The Japanese Emperor also awarded decorations to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: After the signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Italian King sent a telegram to the Japanese Emperor to express his sincere sentiments. The Italian Foreign Minister also sent a telegram to the Japanese Foreign Minister to express his regards. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to a semi-official warning, if the United States dares to intervene in the European conflict with an attitude favoring Britain, the United States will be subjected to naval and land attacks from both oceans. This warning is part of an essay by the Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece, Gayda, commenting on the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Gayda declared in his newspaper that the strength of the Axis powers has greatly increased since Japan joined the alliance, because Japan's navy ranks third in the world. He claimed that the Japanese army is now also under the deployment of Germany and Italy. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Foreign Ministry Ambassador Rocco declared yesterday afternoon at an information conference here that the important significance of the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact during the European and East Asian wars goes without saying. This pact will definitely build a new world order and a new world peace. At the same time, this pact also serves as a warning to other countries' politicians not to interfere in the important issues and spheres of existence of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Rome hopes that the signing of the pact will immediately promote the development of the situation. Residents of Rome eagerly awaited the evening newspaper last night to read the record of this historical event. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>The Process of the Three Countries Concluding the Treaty: Activities of a Secret German Envoy Staying in Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, the German special envoy and confidential messenger of the German Foreign Minister, Stahmer (49 years old), has played an important role in the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact since arriving in Japan on September 7. Reportedly, the "mysterious person" Stahmer came to Tokyo with his wife this time, and made a stopover in Moscow while traveling through Siberia. After arriving here, Stahmer began talks with Foreign Ministry advisor and former ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, and others on September 8. By the 16th, the negotiations had reached a concrete stage and a cabinet meeting was convened for seven and a half hours. Afterwards, Prime Minister Konoe and Planning Board President Hoshino immediately went to the Imperial Palace to report to the Emperor. In the Imperial Conference held on September 19, the decision to approve this pact was endorsed. The cabinet meeting on September 26, lasting twelve hours, discussed this pact, and after eight and a half hours of deliberation, the highest advisory body approved this pact. Later, in the Privy Council held before the Emperor, the proposal to approve this convention was unanimously passed. The council urged the government to take all necessary military and diplomatic means to cope with the international situation. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Stahmer, who Japanese newspapers called the "Masked Envoy," has now been officially identified by Japanese newspapers as the person responsible for bringing Japan into the Axis. The German ambassador to Japan, Major General Ott, recommended Stahmer, saying that he was "Ribbentrop's representative." Ott also said, "Stahmer has contributed greatly to the establishment of this alliance agreement." Although Stahmer's arrival in Japan was known, reports about his activities in Japan were prohibited from being published. Therefore, until last night, the Japanese newspapers called him the "Masked Envoy." The Japanese press is somewhat dissatisfied with Stahmer's attitude, because he often refused to announce news during talks, only expressing joy at the accomplishment of facts, refusing to comment on the agreement, and unwilling to reveal his activities in Japan. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Considers the Tripartite Alliance a Step that Risks the Nation's Fate</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke issued a statement last night, mentioning the conclusion of the treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, declaring, "Japan has taken steps to wager the fate of the entire nation at a time when it is encountering difficulties. The Japanese government believes that it has done its best to overcome all difficulties. Japan's foreign policy is to resolve the China issue, create a new order in Greater East Asia, and enhance world peace. However, certain countries do not understand this purpose very well. They have a mistaken idea that peace is to maintain the old order, and therefore obstruct Japan's work in various ways. Although the Japanese government has tried its best to clarify the situation to these countries and improve relations, the results have not only made no progress, but have even tended to worsen. In this environment, Japan cannot but unite internally and ally with Germany and Italy externally to realize its common political ideals. The German Foreign Minister has long had the desire to promote German-Japanese understanding, and the Italian Foreign Minister once served in the Far East and has a deep understanding of Japan's position. Both have contributed greatly to the conclusion of this pact. After the signing of the treaty, Germany, Italy, and Japan will cooperate with each other to establish a new order in Europe and the Far East. The establishment of this pact does not mean that Japan will immediately join the war, nor does Japan want to threaten any country. The relationship between the three countries and the Soviet Union will not be affected in any way according to the provisions of the pact. In the future, Japan's responsibility for establishing a new order in Greater Asia will be greater than in the past. Although Japan is willing to seriously realize this work, situations that require immediate decisions will inevitably occur. The Japanese government and people are prepared to face all consequences," he said. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, all the newspapers published editorials, saying that Japan was forced into an alliance with Germany and Italy by the attitude and actions of the United States. However, most of them believe that the alliance is not military in nature. The Nichinichi Shimbun predicts that the three strong countries will fight for a long time for the new order, because the United States will continue to strive to maintain the status quo, even after Britain fails. The Asahi Shimbun said that the special clauses regarding the Soviet Union are not only due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, but also because the Japanese-Soviet relationship is very important in the new Asian order. From this point of view, Japan, Germany, and Italy all recognize the Soviet Union as an emerging strong country that can cooperate in building a new world order. This special clause also has important significance for Japan's future diplomacy towards the Soviet Union. The newspaper continued that the economic community expects the United States to increase pressure on Japan, but they are now planning to shift to the south and tighten economic controls on one side, thereby offsetting the adverse effects of the United States. Although this agreement is a kind of military alliance, it does not contain the intention of Japan participating in the European war. However, our responsibility to deal with the current situation in the world will indeed increase as a result. The public is superficially quiet about this move. Only a few buildings in the commercial district have flags of Italy, Germany, and Japan hanging. It is expected that there will be a large mass gathering in the near future to show support for this new alliance. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the questions raised by American journalists about whether the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact is directed at the Soviet Union, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman replied yesterday with regard to Articles 3 and 5 of the Pact, saying that Articles 3 and 5 are sufficient to explain this issue. The spokesman then solemnly pointed out that the signing of the Tripartite Pact cannot be regarded as changing Japan's policy of non-interference, at least for the time being. In short, no one can predict future developments. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>No Excitement Seen in Tokyo</p>
<p>When the announcement of the alliance agreement signed in Berlin reached Tokyo, the city did not appear excited because theaters and restaurants have been closing early and most citizens had returned home. The atmosphere in the Foreign Ministry was extremely tense. The German and Italian embassies in Tokyo were both more cheerful than they had been in months. The embassies of neutral countries had lights on all night, as diplomatic personnel were rushing to prepare reports on the contents of the alliance agreement announced here and telegraph them to their governments. It was declared here last night that the Japanese Emperor had issued an edict authorizing this new alliance to "establish peace as soon as possible." The edict stated, "In order to restore peace, Japan has decided to join hands with Germany and Italy, who share the same ideals. The purpose of this agreement is to enable all countries in the world to obtain what they deserve. In order to overcome the current national crisis, we hope that the whole country will cooperate even more."</p>
<p>Konoe Issues a Message to the Japanese People</p>
<p>In a message to the nation last night, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe said that this new alliance will promote peace. He said, "Germany, Italy, and Japan share common interests. The time for Japan to rebuild Greater East Asia has arrived." The German and Italian ambassadors stationed in Tokyo visited the Foreign Ministry last night after the announcement of the signing of the new alliance. All diplomatic officials "exchanged congratulations. Afterwards, the ambassadors of the two Axis countries went to Konoe's private residence to pay a visit." (Associated Press, 18th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Pacific Fleet Exercises in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to officials here last night, the Soviet Union completed its review of the Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok yesterday.

<h3>Improved US-Soviet Relations: Molotov Receives US Ambassador; Contents of Talks Not Disclosed</h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt last night. This reception was a few hours after Germany, Italy, and Japan announced the establishment of a new military and economic alliance in Berlin. As for the content of the talks between the Soviet Foreign Minister and the US Ambassador, it was not disclosed. Steinhardt had recently returned to the country to report to President Roosevelt on the state of Soviet-American relations, and returned to Moscow at the beginning of this month. Observers pointed out last night that Soviet-American trade has increased in recent months, and that Soviet gold exports to the United States last month were among the largest of any country. It is believed here that the US relationship with the Soviet Union is the best it has been since the establishment of the communist regime in Russia. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Eagerly Seeks Closer Ties with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Since signing the pact with Germany and Italy, Japan's official attention today seems to have shifted to approaching the Soviet Union. Japanese officials seem quite willing to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union of the same nature as the German-Soviet agreement. However, the world is still unaware of the Soviet Union's attitude toward this plan. The Asahi Shimbun published a special commentary this morning, saying that the newly established tripartite agreement may promote closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan, Germany, and Italy all recognize the Soviet Union as an emerging country that can cooperate in building a new order. The newspaper also mentioned the clause in the tripartite treaty that retains the clauses of each signatory country regarding relations with the Soviet Union, saying that this special clause is very important for Japan's future diplomatic policy toward the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Appealed to Britain for Cooperation; Shigemitsu Mamoru Remains Silent on the Tripartite Agreement</h3>
<p>London: Reliable Japanese sources here recently stated that Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Mamoru visited British Foreign Office Undersecretary Butler on Wednesday to make a final appeal to Britain, demanding that Britain cooperate with Japan and criticizing Britain for obstructing Japan's legitimate actions in Asia over the past decade. The Japanese ambassador also asked Britain to immediately reconsider its policy on Japan's actions in East Asia, and assured Britain that Japan had no intention of invading British territories. At that time, Undersecretary Butler calmly asked him to tell him about the news of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Shigemitsu reported that he could not confirm and did not know the opinions of the people. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Land in Haiphong; Chinese Troops Also Prepare to Enter; Japan Obtains Control of Base; French Officers Detained and Vietnamese Soldiers Disarmed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to sources here, the Chinese troops along the Vietnamese border are still within Chinese territory, but it is believed that they will enter Vietnam at the appropriate time. They are now waiting for the situation to clarify. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: After occupying the coastal forts in many provinces (transliteration) yesterday, the Japanese troops have obtained control of Annam's main naval base. This fort is the fortress of the Haiphong estuary. The Japanese troops detained two French officers stationed there and disarmed the Annamese soldiers guarding them. French officials believe that the Japanese occupation of the fort is a "minor accident" and does not seem to have any major repercussions. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Japanese troops continued to land in Haiphong yesterday. Large numbers of Japanese planes flew in for reconnaissance every few hours. The first batch of Japanese troops to land were granted leave yesterday, so there were many Japanese troops coming and going on the streets of Haiphong. However, no accidents have occurred with the French and the natives. The Japanese military headquarters in Haiphong is located in the office of the Southwest Transportation Company. Before the Annam border was sealed off, the company was the only commercial agency specializing in shipping truck cars imported from the United States to China. When the Japanese troops landed in Haiphong, there were hundreds of truck cars waiting to be shipped to China. Since the Japanese army has occupied the company, it may also seize all the truck cars. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>France Claims Agreement Has Been Implemented</p>
<p>Vichy: At 5 p.m. yesterday, it was announced here that the French-Japanese conflict in Dong Dang and Qianqian in Vietnam had ended. Foreign Minister Baudouin said at a cabinet meeting that the war in Vietnam had stopped. Afterwards, an official statement stated that the French-Japanese agreement signed in Hanoi last Sunday is currently being implemented "in the friendly spirit of signing a treaty." This declaration is contrary to the news from Vietnam, which said that the Japanese troops in South China are about to withdraw from Vietnam. Some news said that the Japanese troops are continuing to advance towards Hanoi, and French officials in Vietnam have sent a request to Tokyo to stop the advance of the Japanese troops. According to informed sources here, if the Japanese troops retreat into China, Hanoi may reopen negotiations on a new agreement, allowing these Japanese troops to enter Vietnam under appropriate circumstances. Officials here refused to comment on the news that Colonel Jecko Bee, the representative of the Hanoi government sent to Washington, had obtained a guarantee of material assistance from the United States to resist further Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>Vichy: The cabinet held a state meeting today, chaired by Marshal Pétain. Foreign Minister Baudouin immediately submitted a report on the Vietnam issue, stating, "Although an accident occurred during the implementation of the agreement established between France and Japan on the Vietnam issue, it has now calmed down. Both parties are currently implementing this agreement in the friendly and faithful spirit of its establishment. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Regarding the issue of French Indochina, officials announced that the military agreement established between France and Japan on the 22nd of this month is now being implemented in a normal state. Japanese troops are continuing to land in Haiphong in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. As for Liangshan, there is nothing to report. As of now, the overall situation has gradually returned to normal. The military and political authorities have also ordered the lights in various places to gradually return to normal. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>US Willing to Assist if Vietnam Resists</p>
<p>San Francisco: Jerko Bee, a member of the special envoy group representing French Annam to the United States, declared here yesterday that he had obtained a guarantee from Washington that if Japan further invades Annam, the United States would provide assistance in main materials to resist. He believes that the United States' promise to assist Annam will also have a profound impact on future events in the Far East. Jerko Bee said, "The people of Annam, behind our army, have firmly united and are prepared to resist all attempts to change our political or military status quo." It is heard that Martin, the commander of the French army in Annam, has prepared everything to accept material assistance from the United States. Jerko Bee's declaration is considered extremely important here, because there have also been reports recently that if Annam can maintain its status as an independent French entity, the US government can supply Annam with arms. It is also heard that if Annam is likely to be punished by the Vichy government or fall into the hands of the Germans, the United States would obviously not be willing to help with arms. A few days ago, Jerko Bee said in Washington that Annam was prepared to spend a huge sum of 1,200,000 US dollars to purchase aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Thailand's Attitude Also Becoming Stronger</p>
<p>Bangkok: The Thai government announced that it has ordered a part of the infantry reserves to enlist on October 31, and a part of the naval reserves to enlist on October 15. It is learned that this measure is related to France's refusal to revise its territorial demands. It is claimed that the Bangkok government has received countless petitions from all walks of life in the country, all demanding that the government realize its demands on France by force. The government is pleased with the petitions, but strives to order the people to remain calm. If the possibility of a peaceful understanding between France and Thailand exists for one day, the people should wait for negotiations to resolve the issue. What must be made clear is that the Thai government, in any case, insists on the revision of the border. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Ye Jianying, chief of staff of the Eighth Route Army, recently accused Japan of attempting to force Thailand to act as a vanguard to attack the Malayan Federation and create a Pacific war. Ye also said that after Japan occupies Vietnam, it will carry out a political offensive against Thailand to promote Thailand's attack on Malaya. He also said that due to the geographical situation, it is probably impossible for the Japanese to attack Yunnan from Vietnam. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Dragon Cloud's Departure from Yunnan: Absolutely Groundless</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter, noting the recent contradictory information from Japanese propaganda outlets, visited authoritative sources with access to reliable information to inquire about their views on this matter. According to them, Japan believed that by attacking Vietnam, they could incite estrangement between the southwestern generals and the central government. Thus, on the 18th and 19th of this month, they fabricated stories of Chairman Long being forcibly brought to Chongqing by the central government. However, the truth speaks for itself, as Chairman Long remains firmly stationed on the frontier. Furthermore, on the 22nd of this month, they released news claiming that Chairman Long, in Kunming, made statements to Hong Kong Chinese reporters. This contradicts the previous reports of Chairman Long being forced to Chongqing, and thus disproves itself. They also fabricated stories of President Kong and President Yu leaving Chongqing to go abroad. In reality, President Kong recently presided over a National Saving Movement for National Reconstruction in Chongqing, which was very enthusiastic. President Yu has also been attending various meetings and making speeches recently. They also claimed that the Communist Party made various demands to the government and that the government planned to relocate the capital. All of these are absolutely groundless. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>After the U.S. Loaned China a Huge Sum, the Chongqing Market Became Active, the Credit of Legal Tender Increased, and Prices of Daily Necessities Fell</h3>
<p>Chongqing: After the United States granted China another loan, it has made a profound impression on all sectors in the wartime capital. People are heartened, and the financial market has suddenly become active. The credit of the legal tender has increased, and there are many sellers in the market, a rare sight. Items previously rarely seen have gradually appeared on the market, and the prices of daily necessities have generally fallen. In the past two days, reporters have interviewed several people from all walks of life. Their deep attention to and optimism about the current international situation are unprecedented. Observers said that the political significance of the American loan to China today far outweighs the economic significance. After three years of resistance, the greatness of the Chinese nation and its arduous struggle for world peace have gradually been understood by friendly nations. The American loan and the complete embargo on steel are a reflection of this understanding. As for the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, it has long existed as a fact and has no impact on China's resistance, being regarded only as an international dynamic. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German Planes Attack England Day and Night, Still Centered on the London Area, Indiscriminate Bombing Causes Extensive Damage, British Claim to Have Destroyed 130 German Planes</h3>
<p>Berlin: German planes continued to attack London this morning, seeing that the fires in various places had not yet been extinguished. In the past 36 hours, German planes have dropped over one million kilograms of various types of bombs on southern and central England. (28th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: This morning, a squadron of German bombers and British fighters engaged in a fierce aerial battle southeast of London, lasting for one hour. When the German planes crossed the Kent coast, they were flying very high. Land-based anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, bombarding them fiercely. Heavy artillery fire was heard several times in central London, and an alarm was issued, but no planes were seen. According to a bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation, a total of 133 German planes were shot down yesterday. Several waves of air raids last night were still centered on London, and bombs fell in many places. Incendiary bombs caused fires, but they were quickly extinguished. There were slight casualties among residents. Several houses in the Mouset area were damaged, with few casualties. Although some bombs fell in other parts of the Lanca County, there was little damage. Several towns in the Midlands were bombed, but casualties were relatively light. Several areas between London and the south coast were also bombed by German planes, resulting in only a few houses being destroyed and few civilian casualties. In the evening, some bombs fell in eastern Scotland, but there were no reports of damage or casualties. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Since the 1st of this month, including the German planes shot down during yesterday's air raid, more than 1,000 German planes have been destroyed by attacks on England. According to a bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation, this is the second consecutive month in which the British have destroyed more than 1,000 German planes. After the German air force launched three large-scale attacks on England in three weeks, all of which ended in defeat, German planes approached London again last night and were subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire. Batteries in the suburbs fired shells as densely as rain, and the ground shook as the German bombs exploded. However, the intensity of the fire forced the German planes to at least temporarily divert their course. Most enemy planes were forced to fly very high, and then anti-aircraft batteries in central London also roared in unison. Three bombs fell in quick succession in the central area, and the fires caused by the incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished. Two cities in the Midlands and a city on the northeast coast were also attacked.</p>
<p>Yesterday, large formations of German bombers, protected by an even larger number of fighters, repeatedly attempted to penetrate London's defenses. However, London's defense work proceeded smoothly with little obstruction. According to a bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation, it is now known that a total of 130 enemy planes were destroyed yesterday. Thirty-four British fighters are missing, but 15 pilots are safe. Yesterday's intense anti-aircraft fire in London was unprecedented. According to Reuters air force correspondents observing the battle in the southeastern suburbs of London, British planes intercepted fiercely. Anti-aircraft shells exploded over the Thames Estuary, and black smoke filled the sky at an altitude of 25,000 feet. Before long, eight large German bombers fled in disarray. These eight were perhaps the remnants of a large formation of German planes. Allied planes and German fighters fought fiercely over the bombers. This scene was frequently seen over the southern suburbs of London and the towns facing the English Channel. Enemy planes attempted to find a way to penetrate London, but failed and hastily dropped their bombs and fled.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Aviation's intelligence department stated that the German air force launched its largest attack on Britain in two weeks yesterday, and its loss of pilots was the highest since the 15th of this month. Yesterday, the British air force destroyed 128 enemy planes, and anti-aircraft guns shot down two. The attacking enemy planes were divided into four groups. Three of them flew directly to London and southeastern England, and the fourth flew to Bristol. The first group of 180 planes crossed the coast near Dunas in Kent at 8:45 yesterday morning. Only 30 of them infiltrated London, all of which were Messerschmitts. Only a few circled overhead carrying ammunition, waiting for Dornier and Heinkel heavy bombers, but the bombers did not arrive. The Messerschmitt German planes were then severely attacked, and British patrols shot down four enemy planes, severely damaged many more, and pursued the remnants of the enemy planes to a point ten miles outside the English Channel.

<h3>German Military Communique</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to an official statement from the German High Command, German planes attacked military targets and ports in London and southern England yesterday, causing large fires.

German planes attacked a convoy north of Ireland, sinking one merchant ship (5,000 tons). Several British planes raided the western border of Germany at night, indiscriminately bombing without causing any damage. German planes concentrated on bombing London and Liverpool last night. In yesterday's aerial battles, 101 British planes were shot down, and 38 German planes are missing. A German minesweeper attacked a British submarine with depth charges, and it is believed to have sunk. (28th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Planes Fly to Germany for Days, Conducting Large-Scale Air Raids, Three German Warships Hit in the Kiel Canal</h3>
<p>London: A bulletin from the Ministry of Aviation stated that British bombers have conducted large-scale air raids on various German ports used for invading England and on transportation lines in western Germany. According to responsible sources, in the week ending September 26th, British air forces attacked German territory or occupied areas day and night. Notable targets include (1) the Kiel Canal, where the German warship "Scharnhorst" was damaged by bombs that fell nearby, and two other warships were directly hit, (2) the Templehof Airfield in Berlin, (3) the Lauta aluminum plant, 100 miles southeast of Berlin, (4) the Siemens and Halske electrical equipment factory. In addition, the Folkenhardt and Friederik-Haven power stations, and the water pipes of the Mülheim-Montigny canal were also bombed by British planes. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation's intelligence department stated that from 8:00 PM on the 26th of this month, British planes raided the Kiel shipyards until after 1:00 AM. One plane reported that fires broke out in the dock area, the situation was terrible. British planes also bombed Havre for two hours and fifteen minutes.

<h3>Free French Forces Join British Forces to Attack Dakar, Admit That It Has Failed, Several British Warships Were Damaged</h3>
<p>London: Although the Dakar affair has failed, we acknowledge that. However, there is no reason to place too much importance on this situation. The British government now believes that this matter has come to an end. The reason for this failure of the Free French Forces was the inaccuracy of the view of Dakar people being supporters of General Troglo. French warships departing from the Mediterranean suddenly arrived at Dakar. During the engagement, several British warships were hit by artillery fire, but the damage was not serious. Rumors that General Troglo is currently en route to Vietnam are untrue. His whereabouts are currently unknown. (2-</p>
<h3>Gandhi Meets with the Indian Viceroy for a Long Talk of Three and a Half Hours</h3>

People generally felt that Gandhi's hopes of being allowed to freely express his views on India's participation in the war and declare his non-violent beliefs were difficult to reconcile with the Indian government's policy of waging war and increasing India's war efforts to the maximum extent.

<h3>Germany and Italy Persuade Spain to Join the Military Alliance, to Utilize Spain's Strategic Bases to Seriously Threaten Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to usually reliable sources here, Nationalist Spain will join the new military and economic alliance signed here by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Spanish Interior Minister Serrano Suñer met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano here yesterday for two hours. It was subsequently reported that Foreign Minister Ciano would stay in Berlin for several more days and would not return to Rome immediately. Before the meeting between the Italian Foreign Minister and the Spanish Interior Minister, Spanish officials and several senior German officials (including Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop) had held detailed discussions here this week. Diplomatic circles firmly believe that when the new military and economic alliance treaty is established here, Spain will definitely be one of the signatory countries. It is pointed out here that Nationalist Spain has "very significant effects." Spain will recover its small territories in South America, receive economic assistance from the Axis powers, and may recover Gibraltar. Spain can provide the following benefits to the Allied countries: (1) Allow the Axis powers to use Spain's naval and air bases with military value, so as to tighten the blockade against Britain and break its blockade against Germany and Italy. (2) Control Gibraltar to threaten the British Mediterranean fleet. (3) Facilitate transportation to Dakar, as it is widely believed that the Axis powers will use this point to invade the Western Hemisphere in the future. (4) Incite the Spanish-speaking countries in South America to divert the United States' attention to the Far East. German newspapers today all publish the news of this new military and economic alliance on the entire front page, speeding up the "collapse" of the British Empire. (28th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Visits Hitler</h3>

It is also learned that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will leave Germany and return to his country today. (28th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Turkey Seeks to Promote Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>It is said that the reaction of Germany, Italy, and Japan to the Turkey pact may cause Turkey to seek to promote relations with the Soviet Union. People here generally believe that the wording of the pact is clearly a warning to the United States and weakens Britain's position. It is widely believed that in view of the evolution of the international situation, in order to enhance its own position, Turkey has decided to strive to promote relations with the Soviet Union. Some say that Moscow will accept Turkey's movements. (28th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Communist propaganda in various Balkan countries has recently undergone a significant change. Leaflets printed under the direction of Moscow, which have always been anti-British in nature, now only have an anti-Axis tendency. A leaflet distributed in Bulgaria warned of the increasing number of so-called German "tourists" in the country. It is said that these Germans are either the Fifth Column, preparing to turn Bulgaria into a base for German imperialism." Knowledgeable observers believe that the Soviet Union's recent actions in the Balkans indicate that its current policy is to secretly reduce the influence of the Axis powers to the extent possible, while maintaining amicable relations with Germany on the surface to avoid possible accidents.

<p>American Pacific Fleet and Air Force</p>
<h3>America's Pacific Policy</h3>
<p>— Original author John Gunther, published in the American Foreign Affairs Quarterly</p>
<p>Secondly, if Japan and the United States go to war, the Philippine Islands will inevitably become Japan's first target. The ability of the United States to defend these islands has sparked heated debate among many experts. The majority opinion is that the Philippines cannot withstand continuous or large-scale Japanese attacks. To make the Philippines impregnable, it would cost at least $1 billion, but under the current circumstances, the U.S. Congress is unlikely to approve it.</p>
<p>The position of the United States in China and the Philippines is quite vulnerable. If the United States and Japan go to war, everyone can see that the center of gravity will be the defense line in the central Pacific. This defense line is the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of January 1, 1940, the naval strength comparison between the United States and Japan is as follows:</p>
<p>Among these many ships, on the American side, there is one battleship, two light cruisers, one hundred and fifteen destroyers, and thirty-two submarines that have exceeded their service life and are close to being abandoned. On the Japanese side, there is also one battleship, five heavy cruisers, eight light cruisers, thirty-six destroyers, and nineteen submarines that have exceeded their service life.</p>
<p>Since January 1, 1940, the U.S. warships under construction include eight new battleships (300,000 tons), two aircraft carriers (34,700 tons), six light cruisers (44,000 tons), one giant minelayer, thirty-one destroyers (49,980 tons), and fifteen submarines (20,820 tons). The details of Japan's shipbuilding are kept strictly secret and are unknown. However, as far as is known, the ships that have been built and are planned to be built include four battleships, two aircraft carriers, five light cruisers, nine destroyers, and three submarines. Among them, the average weight of the newly built battleships is about 40,000 tons. U.S. naval experts believe that the size of Japan's new battleships will not only be greatly increased, but there are four or even eight that have already been launched. Among the new U.S. battleships, there are six of 35,000 tons and two of 45,000 tons. These battleships are larger than any existing battleships, and they are also faster and have stronger combat power. According to a report in the New York Times, the naval commander, Stark, said that the two battleships built in 1941 may reach 52,000 tons or even 55,000 tons. The tonnage of U.S. battleships is limited by the 110-foot width of the Panama Canal lock, so it can only be built to this maximum height.</p>
<p>Japan's mandated islands, formerly belonging to Germany, occupy a vast area in the southwestern Pacific, including the Palau Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands, which include a total of 1,400 islands. But the total area is only 829 square miles, most of which are worthless coral islands, and few have military value. The only place with a good port and fortifications is Truk Island, and another possible or existing base is Saipan Island, north of Guam. In 1939, Japan opened an air route from Yokohama to the island, and from there to the Palau Islands. Japan has strictly prohibited foreigners from traveling to these islands for several years; therefore, few people know the truth.</p>
<p>The United States is also building bases in the Pacific. After these bases are completed, the U.S. defense line in the Pacific will become an irregular triangle, from Alaska to Hawaii, and from Hawaii to the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Complementing this triangle are other bases, such as Midway Island and Wake Island, which are sufficient to form a vanguard to defend Hawaii. As for the islands south of Hawaii, such as Johnston, Palmyra, and Canton, they can also become a barrier between Hawaii and the Panama Canal Zone. Further south is the American island of Samoa, which has not yet been designated as a base, but can be transformed into one.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Alaska and the Aleutian region. The base in this region guards the key route of the great circle between Japan and the United States, which is the shortest route across the Pacific. The naval authorities have spent $8,570,000 as operating expenses for the island. The Army Department plans to allocate $12,734,000 to improve the base there, but it has been rejected by the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Moving south from Alaska, we arrive at Hawaii. Here, on Oahu, the United States has turned Pearl Harbor into the Gibraltar of the Pacific, at a cost of at least $700 million. It is the second most important military point in the United States after the Panama Canal. Pearl Harbor has a submarine base, dry docks, fuel and ammunition depots, and a large-scale naval station. It is large enough to accommodate the entire U.S. fleet, and it also has a naval airfield with enough food to last for fifty days. There are also many airfields built nearby.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the Panama Canal. Most American experts believe that the Panama Canal can avoid attacks from the Pacific due to the long distance. Japan is nearly 800 miles away from the Panama Canal. Any Japanese aircraft carrier that attempts to bomb the Panama Canal will encounter full defense, so Japan's adventure will not become a problem.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the issue of defending Guam. Guam is located outside the 180th meridian, with an area of 250 square miles and a population of 21,000 Chamorro natives, far outside the inner circle of American Pacific interests. It is 3,300 miles west of Honolulu, 1,500 miles east of Manila, and 1,350 miles from Yokohama. Therefore, Guam is closer to Japan than to the United States. Apart from the Philippines, Guam can be said to be the westernmost territory of the United States. However, Guam is surrounded by shoals of islands under Japanese mandate. Japan's base on Saipan Island is only 100 miles away from Guam.</p>
<p>Many American naval experts advocate turning Guam into the "Gibraltar of the Pacific," making it a submarine and air base. Moderates only ask to spend $5 million to deepen Apra Harbor and build breakwaters and ramps for seaplanes. Guam is currently only an important link in the Pacific air route.</p>

<h3>Food Prices: Rice Prices Cause Great Commotion; Imported Rice Fluctuates by Two to Three Dollars; No. 1 Saigon Sells for Seventy-Three Dollars; Top-Grade White Rice Actually Opens at Ninety Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the imported rice market tightened again the other day, yesterday it was even more agitated by the Vietnam issue, rumors of shipping disruptions, which fueled rising sentiment. Those with goods hoarded them, considering them rare commodities, and those wanting to buy rushed to do so. For a time, speculation and actual sales went hand in hand, and sellers' calls flew. In a moment in the early morning, each price had risen by one dollar. Afterwards, they continued to rise, and by the end of the session, the result was a noted increase of two dollars. No. 1 Saigon was seventy-three dollars, Fire Cracker seventy-two dollars, No. 2 Saigon sixty-eight dollars, No. 3 Siam sixty-seven dollars, Small Pattern sixty-six and a half, sixty-six dollars. The original packaged Yinghua Company rice was even more active in speculation, with No. 2 Saigon at seventy-nine and a half dollars, seventy-nine dollars and eight cents, reaching as high as eighty dollars. No. 2 Siam was seventy-nine dollars, and there were even calls for eighty dollars. Small Cracker was seventy-eight dollars, also soaring two or three dollars compared to the previous day. However, at noon, Shenji Foreign Company and Jianyuan Company suddenly announced four or five thousand tons of telegrams, and the market immediately turned flat. At noon, it was rumored in the market that the order had been reinstated at eighty dollars, and one said it had not yet been reinstated, but it was possible to be reinstated on Monday. People's hearts immediately became empty, and rice prices fell sharply by one or two dollars in the afternoon.</p>
<p>As the supply of thick and thin varieties of rice continued to be cut off, and as imported rice soared, its momentum became more and more popular, as if it were about to soar to the sky. It was heard that Kaichang's high-grade rice had actually reached the ninety-dollar mark, and the next best, Susu rice, also required eighty-five or sixty dollars. Other Nangang fresh, original-packaged early rice also sold for a record high price of ninety dollars, 86.7 to 85 dollars per bushel, a huge jump of two or three dollars compared to before.</p>
<p>Although the supply of new rice tips was continuous, it was not as strong as the previous week, with only over a thousand packages. However, the sales floor took advantage of this good news and sold out in an instant. The price rose by two or three dollars along with the broken rice. Zhuanqiao new rice opened at seventy-nine dollars, Jiading Taicang new rice tips at sixty-nine dollars, and Qingjiao Du tips at seventy dollars and five cents.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice alone, due to its narrow outlet, both domestic and imported goods remained at their original levels, without gains or losses. Jinli special yuan sold for seventy-two dollars, Changdan seventy-one dollars, seventy-one dollars, similar to Hong Kong yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Firm and Steady; Wheat Sales Dull</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday was the end of the week, and apart from scattered retail sales on this street, customers and hoarders had no activity. This was because trading in futures of Japanese Phoenix Brand flour had ceased, and the number of factory warehouse receipts for returned goods was limited. Moreover, at the end of the month, various factories collected warehouse rent, so new buyers felt particularly lacking. However, with the price of rice being expensive and the production of current flour being insufficient, sentiment was considered firm and steady. The price of No. 2 factory was sixteen dollars and five cents, and returned goods still had to be raised by one dollar. Although there was a large amount of imported flour traded, the inventory of spot goods was not large. Yesterday, this street purchased 500 packages of Fortress Brand flour, which still required eighteen dollars and two cents. The whole market of Chinese factories sold a total of more than six thousand packages, but various stores still had no goods to meet the market demand.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market continued to be dull. Because the supply of sources from inland Jinghu Line area was still small, the appetite of Japanese and Chinese factories was flat, and it was not easy for the market to rise. In the end, it hovered at the original price. There was little activity in the overall market. Apart from Chinese factories receiving one or two hundred packages, Japanese factories only received two or three thousand packages. The selling price was still around twenty-four and a half dollars and twenty-one dollars.</p>
<h3>Finance: Divergence in British and American Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices, remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates fluctuated on the weekend, with the underlying trend initially tight and then loosening, resulting in a mixed phenomenon. The British soft was .015625, which was three shillings fourpence eight four three seven five. The American hard was .03125, which was five yuan four zero six two five. The American exchange rate was soft because various Chinese and foreign banks intended to sell, and it was heard that speculators had opened short positions. Also, a certain Jewish merchant was returning to his country and released the US dollars in his hand. The tightness of the British exchange rate was due to the continued support of Hong Kong Telecom.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Banks Continue to Advance Orders</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's major items, near and far, were still flat. The New York silver price and the London gold price were both reported to be fixed. The exchange rates of British to American and American to Shanghai were all flat. The American to British fell by two and a half cents, and to Shanghai by a small three cents. The central bank's listed prices for various exchanges, such as sales, the banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, British gold at three shillings fourpence eight four three seven five, and American exchange at five yuan three four three seven five. Compared to the previous close, the British was tight .015625, and the American soft .03125. After the opening, Chinese banks and Japanese banks all intended to sell, and the market was stable. It was calculated that the spot US dollars were sold to foreign banks such as Yuli at five yuan three seven five. At the same time, foreign banks also had matching transactions.

Afterwards, overseas Chinese sold to Hong Kong Telecom British gold for October at three shillings fourpence eight four three seven five, and shortly after it was heard that Jewish merchants also sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at five yuan four zero six two five, and the situation turned hard.

<h3>Financial Commentary – September 28th –</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kai</p>
<p>In mid-September, news from Hong Kong claimed that a large loan between China and the United States had been established. At that time, not only did the United States not admit it, nor did they acknowledge it, but also the Chinese economic envoy, Mr. Song Ziwen, remained silent. However, despite the fact that it could not be confirmed at the time, it attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign people, and the Japanese felt as if they were sitting on pins and needles. Now, on the eve of the Japanese army's invasion of Vietnam, when the crisis in the Pacific was about to reach its climax, the United States announced the formal establishment of the new Sino-US loan.</p>
<p>According to the official document of the United States: The US government lent 25 million US dollars to China to maintain China's foreign exchange needs. According to Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Economic Revival Committee, the new loan to China will be handled by the Export-Import Bank, which is semi-official in nature, and will be directly loaned to the Chinese government, guaranteed by the Central Bank, and the debt will be offset by the price of tungsten sold to the United States. The United States has decided to purchase tungsten worth 30 million US dollars from the China Resources Committee for the needs of US national defense. This loan to China by the US Export-Import Bank is the third time, with a total of 70 million US dollars lent to China.</p>
<p>Although this loan of 25 million US dollars is not as large as the amount rumored before, in the era when the lines between the aggressors and the anti-aggressors are clearly defined in the international situation, when Japan is taking advantage of the situation to realize its southward policy, the United States suddenly continues to lend to China. As far as the United States itself is concerned, it shows that the United States is concerned about the Far East, and the status quo in the Far East does not allow arbitrary changes by the aggressors. Now Japan's invasion of Vietnam is not only a powerful blow to Burma, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, but also a major threat to the United States in the Pacific. Therefore, the United States actively assists China in its war of resistance, so that Japan is restrained by the war against China, and is unable to act freely in the South Pacific. However, in the process of China's self-reliance in resisting aggression and building the country, what it expects from the United States is increasing. Since this loan is to repay debts with tungsten, China currently has no way to transport tungsten to the United States due to the closure of the Burma Road. Therefore, the United States should actively encourage Britain to open the Burma Road unconditionally on October 18, after only three months of closure. Not only can the United States itself obtain the materials needed for national defense from China, but China can also obtain the assistance of the United States in terms of military fire and other items, so as to enhance China's anti-aggression forces and restrain Japan's actions in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The establishment of the new Sino-US loan, from a political point of view, has been described above. From a financial point of view, how will it affect China's anti-war economy? The author should also point out some things. According to the official document of the United States, it is to help China maintain its foreign exchange needs, so although the amount is small, the equivalent of British pounds is more than 6 million pounds, accounting for more than three-fifths of the amount of the British equalization fund in 1939, which is certainly better than the 5 million pounds of assistance provided by Britain at that time in maintaining the exchange rate of the Chinese legal tender. However, how the Chinese government will use this 25 million US dollars of foreign exchange funds depends on the facts in the future, but the author observes that it will not be outside the following two ways: one is to intensify the economic construction of free China, and the other is to stabilize the black market for the legal tender. There are two kinds of funds needed for the economic construction of the anti-war: one is the legal tender needed internally, and the other is the foreign exchange needed externally. The former is currently being vigorously promoted by Chairman Chiang himself, so the accumulation of surplus funds is not a problem. However, the development of mines, the establishment of light and heavy industries, the construction of water conservancy, and the development of transportation and other anti-war economic constructions, all require foreign exchange funds to purchase machinery, materials, and tools from abroad, so the collection of foreign exchange funds is a very important issue. Therefore, in order to promote the economic construction of the anti-war, China must invest this 25 million US dollars of loans in the purchase of machinery, materials, and tools.

<h3>The Bullish Gold Market Turns Bearish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation, after the heavy rise the previous day, suddenly fell back again. This was because the exchange market was loose and flat, and the market fluctuated unstably, which made people wary. On the contrary, those who sold short added to their positions when the price was high. Therefore, after opening at six thousand one hundred and twenty yuan today, although the banks bought it up, it rose again to a high price of six thousand one hundred and twelve yuan. However, after this, gold dealers and floating bulls sold each other, and at that time the exchange market turned hard, immediately falling to six thousand and ninety yuan. Later, it relied on the securities firms to pull it up by 20 yuan, but suddenly a certain bank came to sell short, and retail investors followed suit, adding to the sales. In addition, before the close, the bulls in the securities firms violently came out of the cage. It was heard that they had turned from bulls to bears, so it had fallen to six thousand and sixty-five yuan. Fortunately, the money exchange industry pulled it up at noon, so it closed at six thousand and seventy-five yuan, resulting in a drop of forty-five yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume in half a day was about four thousand taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was down by ten yuan, and the customs gold was flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls Forty-Five Yuan</p>
<p>The market started firmly in the morning, rising by ten yuan at the opening. Gold dealers sold to banks twenty taels, for six thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Then, the exchange market was slightly tight, and a certain bank's appetite was still healthy, searching for three or four hundred taels, so it had been raised to six thousand one hundred and forty-two yuan. Soon, because the exchange market turned loose, gold dealers and banks competed to sell, immediately falling by dozens of yuan, with banks trading twenty taels with each other, retreating to six thousand and ninety yuan. After this, relying on the securities firms and retail investors to pull it up, although it rose back to six thousand one hundred and ten yuan, it fell again to six thousand and ninety yuan because the banks tended to sell short. At that time, gold dealers and retail investors also came to sell, and in addition, the securities firms massively came out of the cage before the close, falling miserably to six thousand and sixty-five yuan. However, the closing relied on a certain money exchange company's sudden buying intent, so the result was six thousand and seventy-five yuan, a drop of forty-five yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by seventy-seven yuan in half a day. The selling price of the main brand gold of the cash gold shops was more than ten yuan higher according to the spot gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bidding gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael was unchanged at first, but at noon, it was down by one yuan. It was calculated that Datongxing changed the suspension to six hundred and thirty yuan, and the new companies had similar prices to the previous prices. The purchase was reduced by about thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, spot gold suddenly tended to fall again, and the British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan unanimously. Although the demand for British gold notes was rare, the note holders were also unwilling to depress the price and sell. Therefore, the market price still remained at the original level. American gold notes initially rose to eighteen yuan and six cents because the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan had signed a military and economic alliance guarantee. Later, because the black market for American exchange loosened, the market price gradually fell, and finally it was eighteen yuan and three and a half cents, a drop of one cent and three points compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose back by one cent. The supply and demand of Japanese gold notes were equal, and the market price was stable. The evening market was still one yuan and four cents and nine points. The demand for Korean notes was slightly higher, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening market rising to one yuan, one cent, and nine points.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Buyers Swarm</h3>
<p>The securities black market, yesterday the market turned to rising again, the trend was quite unstable, especially in the afternoon. The return the other day was because people generally believed that the Sino-US loan was not income in cash, and it has now been proven that it is specially used to maintain foreign exchange loans, which proves the close relationship between China and the United States. The alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is nothing more than an old story, and it is not valued by all parties, which is enough to show its imposing appearance but weak inside. Therefore, the future of public debt has gradually entered the main road, and with the promotion of abundant floating funds, buying when the price is small has become a slogan for most people in the market. Occasional pressure from the inspection party is just to create opportunities for the multi-party. Yesterday afternoon, in the midst of the valiant buying by various parties, Type A broke through five yuan, Type B broke through eight yuan, Type C approached seven yuan, Type D also rushed out of the five yuan mark, and Type E also reached six yuan. Type D has exceeded the high price of September 10 and seen a new high price. Buyers are in eager need of No. 6, absorbing more than 300,000 in the morning and afternoon. Lianhe Xinfu, Tongsheng Hongda, Le Maohengkang, and Yitai all have considerable needs. The sellers Tongkang is mostly Renchang Yongkang Datong Lianyi and Hengfu are all selling out, and the market price has been rising in a straight line from morning to night, with a difference of more than one yuan between high and low. As a result, they all rose back six, seven cents to one yuan and one cent, and the total number of transactions was more than one and a half million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, one hundred shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded, at a price of six yuan and nine cents. London external loans, etc., were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Baoan Insurance Pays Dividends</h3>
<p>The British Baoan Insurance Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay the interim dividend for this year on November 15, at twelve shillings and sixpence per share.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: More Than a Thousand Packages of Green Sugar Open; Dutch Cotton White Falls Slightly by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market association's price, spot 24 coarse white July arrival seventy-nine yuan, new goods eighty yuan, transit goods sixty-three yuan, Dutch cotton white BS mark seventy-five yuan, down five cents, Dutch red sixty-one yuan and five cents, road goods sixty-one yuan, this factory's No. 1 ice one hundred and one yuan and five cents, Jingming ice one hundred and three yuan, winter mist green sixty-four yuan, bowl green sixty-two yuan, more than a thousand packages opened by Xinyi, Taikoo B mark spot seventy-six yuan and two cents, DY mark seventy-four yuan and three cents, HX mark seventy-four yuan and two cents to seventy-four yuan, H red sixty-one yuan, Taikoo Foreign Company opened October shipment B mark thirteen yuan and seven cents and five points, DY mark thirteen yuan and one cent and five points, HX mark thirteen yuan and zero five points, all calculated in Hong Kong dollars, totaling 10,000 packages traded.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Concentrated; Yarn Market Is Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall; Shuangma Returns to the 1,100 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, but actual sales still maintained the market, so people's hearts were very good, and they were unanimously optimistic. The number of chips in the market was slightly dry, and buyers were more and more prosperous, so the market trend was rising. However, the overseas cotton market was still weak, and foreign exchange softened. Generally speaking, speculation in foreign exchange and gold has been tasteless recently, and everyone is inclined to attack Shuangma, so the yarn market has become easy to rise and difficult to fall.</p>
<p>Shuangma yarn opened in the morning with enthusiastic popularity. Everyone looked forward to rising, because the big players had good ideas, and the chips on the market were absorbed by them and closed down. The opening price was one thousand and ninety-five yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers flocked in, and the momentum was sharp, immediately rising to one thousand one hundred and fifteen yuan. Soon after, it was heard that foreign exchange was lengthened and gold prices were depressed, and floating bulls released, falling to one thousand and ninety-seven yuan. Shortly before the close, it suddenly rose to one thousand one hundred and seven yuan, and then it traded to one thousand one hundred and twelve yuan. The statistics for half a day show that 4,055 packages were traded, and the price rose by 27 yuan. Today, there are 1,415 pieces of yarn being shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each helping mouth is listed below, divided as follows: 3,200 for fellow traders, 400 for Yunnan (statistics), 055 for Hong Kong, 615 for Ningbo, 10.</p>
<h3>Spot Transaction Volume Increases, Cotton Prices Look High</h3>
<p>Although spot cotton trading has not seen a significant upswing, people's confidence is high due to the good yarn market, and they are also optimistic about cotton prices.</p>
<p>Another report indicates that overseas cotton market prices in the New York cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying in the early morning. However, later due to unfavorable European political news and selling by spot merchants, the closing price fell by 13-14 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 4 rupees.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, trading has become more active again recently. This is because foreign firms, due to the German-Japanese-Italian pact and the increase in terrorist incidents, require full payment for orders of foreign cotton. Therefore, various parties are unwilling to place orders, and those in the trade are turning to the spot market. Many spot transactions have occurred recently, and it is predicted that the spot market will become even more active in the future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Candles, Soap, Matches - All Prices Rising</h3>
<p>The match market is tight, and it is rumored that taxes will also increase. There is also talk of pricing based on the daily gold price of the joint venture. Factories are dispatching limited quantities, and traders are increasing their reserves, searching the market for supplies. As a result, the market situation is tightening. Yesterday, "Beautiful" brand sold for 255 yuan, "Phoenix" brand for 253 yuan, and miscellaneous brands for 201 yuan.</p>
<p>Soap traders and hoarders, seeing the prices of all goods rising, are actively hoarding again. The market feels lively, and prices are rising. Yesterday, "Gu Ben" soap was at 22.40 yuan, "Xiang Mao" soap at 16 yuan, and "Bai Xiang Mao" at 20.08 yuan.</p>
<p>There have been many rumors in the market about foreign candles in recent days, with talk of strikes in the water and electricity sectors. Due to extremely scarce inventory, prices are also high. Yesterday, "Ship" brand sold for 18.40 yuan, "Chicken" brand for 18 yuan, and miscellaneous brands for 16 yuan. (Kun)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Singapore Actively Purchases Cotton Cloth, Factory Prices Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Chinese Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was firm and rising, with factory prices steadily increasing. Traders and wholesalers on this street actively absorbed supplies, and trading increased sharply. The selling price of white cotton cloth (coarse and fine twill) rose by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan per bolt. Dyed cloth also mostly increased by 1.10 to 1.30 yuan per bolt. Printed goods remained stable. On Mu Street, about 1,300 pieces of gray cloth, dyed cloth, and coarse cloth were traded. On North Road, the Yantai group traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, and serge. The Guangdong-Hong Kong group traded 200-300 pieces of twill and dyed cloth. The Zhejiang-Fujian group traded nearly 200 pieces of dyed cloth and dyed twill. Over 5,000 bolts of dyed cloth, bleached twill, and dyed khaki were sold overseas to places like Singapore.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Customer demand from Yantai and Tianjin is strong, and sentiment on this street is also good. Selling prices are gradually rising. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 34.12 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, fewer were selling and more were buying. The situation became stronger, closing at 34.60 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge opened at 0.99 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Today, 595 pieces of cotton cloth were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Rises About a Yuan, Market Dominated by Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the edible oil market was unremarkable at the opening, and trading was not very active. Prices saw a slight correction. However, speculators were actively trading, pushing prices up and down rapidly, resulting in little overall change. Soybean oil remained firm, with tight pricing. 50 pieces of Yantai soybean oil were traded at a price of 78.50 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 203-204 yuan. 300 loads of "Da You" factory soybean oil were priced at 85.70 to 87 yuan. Groundnut oil saw 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil traded at 70 to 69.50 yuan. 500 pieces for October delivery were priced at 69.75 yuan. 1,200 pieces for late October delivery were priced at 71 to 71.75 yuan. 150 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 96 to 97.50 yuan. 100 barrels for early October delivery were priced at 97 yuan. 500 barrels for late October delivery were priced at 98 to 98.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Silk Prices Rise, Local Market Lacks Activity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market suddenly rose, with near-term contracts up 3 cents, deferred contracts up 5 cents, and spot prices up 2 cents, breaking the previous stagnant trend. At the same time, trading volume on the exchange was exceptionally active, with 1,630 loads traded (compared to only 10-20 loads per day in the past month). Yokohama spot prices rose only 10 yuan, while deferred contracts fell 6 yuan. This is because tensions in the Pacific are increasing. Even if Japan and the United States do not engage in military conflict, their economic conflicts will become sharper. After the U.S. ban on scrap iron exports, purchases of Japanese silk may also be affected. This is why New York silk prices have increased. Local trading lacks activity and will likely remain stagnant in the near future.</p>
<h3>Metals: "Hui Si" Iron is Quite Firm</h3>
<p>The main buyers of "Hui Si" iron are canneries on this street, followed by toy factories, printing factories, and biscuit companies. In addition, customers from Tianjin, Yantai, and other places also occasionally seek supplies, but in smaller quantities than before. Therefore, under this trend, those holding goods are quite confident. Furthermore, with no spot goods arriving from overseas, prices will undoubtedly rise. Dark market prices are 4-5 yuan higher than before. Yesterday, the asking price for "Old Steel Factory" goods was 175 yuan per case, "New Steel Factory" goods were 165 yuan per case, and "Wild Chicken" goods were priced between 120-150 yuan, without a fixed standard.</p>

<h3>British Tram and Bus Services to Resume This Morning, Yu Qiaqing Resolves Dispute Reasonably, French Strike Negotiations to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>Following strikes by workers at the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company and China Bus Company in the International Settlement, and workers at the French-owned Tram Company in the French Concession, direct negotiations between labor and management of the respective companies did not achieve a satisfactory resolution. As a result, tram and bus services in the International Settlement were completely suspended. While the French Concession managed to maintain some services with police protection, very unfortunate incidents occurred. Residents of the settlements experienced extreme inconvenience. After Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Lvdeng of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association accepted a request from the workers to mediate, the strike wave at the tram company and bus company in the International Settlement was successfully resolved yesterday. Workers at both companies are scheduled to resume work this morning, and tram and bus services will resume simultaneously. Negotiations on improved treatment conditions raised by workers at the French-owned Tram Company are about to begin, and it is not difficult to find a solution.</p>
<p>Tram Workers to Resume Work, Mr. Yu Qiaqing to Mediate</p>
<p>Labor and management at the tram company in the International Settlement had been deadlocked for a week due to the tram strike, causing serious transportation difficulties. Therefore, both sides were eager to find a solution quickly. Although negotiations had been held several times, they all ended in failure. Until 7:00 PM the night before last, four representatives of the tram union met with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, stating the current hardships of the workers and requesting him to uphold justice. Mr. Yu agreed to mediate immediately, and the management also expressed its willingness to accept outside mediation. Thus, the week-long strike took a sudden turn for the better.</p>
<p>Sincere Negotiations Lasted a Long Time</p>
<p>According to a report from the Dazhong News Agency, at 11:00 AM yesterday, four labor representatives from the tram company went to the Shipping Club on Wuma Road again to meet with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, saying that all workers were very supportive of Mr. Yu's mediation and that management must accept the workers' preconditions for resuming work. Mr. Yu agreed to relay this to management. At 4:00 PM, the tram union received a call from management saying that it would send representatives to the tram company headquarters on South Suzhou Road to negotiate. The labor side immediately sent four representatives to the headquarters. Mr. Yu and Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Affairs Mediation Division of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement also attended. Mr. Hu Ziyu, the general manager of the company, represented management. The two sides negotiated in a harmonious manner for two hours before reaching a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>Management Accepts Preconditions</p>
<p>The preconditions for resuming work proposed by labor and accepted by management are recorded as follows: (1) Increase wages by 0.18 yuan per day and subsidize rice by 0.17 yuan (starting from October 1); (2) Workers' operational errors will still be handled as usual, but no striking workers will be dismissed; (3) Wages for the strike period will be paid for five days (wage increases will still be given); (4) The company will consider and negotiate on the labor-management mutual benefit agreement and resolve it within two weeks.</p>
<p>All Trams to Run This Morning</p>
<p>After the negotiation was resolved, the labor side immediately notified the workers to resume work this morning. It is reported that more than 3,000 workers in the car, machinery, and other departments have complied with the order and will go to work this morning according to the company's schedule. The company has sent workers to inspect the tracks on all routes in order to resume tram and trolleybus services. It is reported that starting this morning, all tram routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and trolleybus routes 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 24 in the International Settlement will resume services. However, before the strike at the French-owned Tram Company in the French Concession is resolved, trams on all routes will temporarily suspend services into the French Concession.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Hopes for Labor-Management Cooperation</p>
<p>After mediating the labor dispute at the bus and tram companies in the International Settlement yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing told a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency that the strikes at the British-owned bus and tram companies were not only damaging to both sides, but also detrimental to the overall social security. Fortunately, this matter has been resolved. However, the rising cost of living has not decreased. He hopes that management can take into account the living conditions of labor, and that labor should also consider the future of management's business. If labor-management cooperation is implemented, not only will conflicts between the two sides not occur, but also unnecessary sacrifices can be avoided. This is what is urgently needed between labor and management at present.</p>
<p>Bus Services to Resume This Morning, Labor-Management Mediators Negotiate Together</p>
<p>The strike at the British-owned China Bus Company in the International Settlement had been going on for five days. After the labor side submitted four preconditions to the company at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, labor representatives went to Mr. Yu Qiaqing's residence to discuss the labor's true intentions. Then, Mr. Yu accompanied the representatives to the company's main office at 111 Sassoon House on Nanjing Road and the Bund to begin negotiations with company representatives. The four preconditions proposed by labor were: (1) Increase the daily living allowance by 0.50 yuan; (2) Pay wages for the strike period; (3) Do not dismiss workers without cause; (4) Resolve the 23 articles of the labor-management mutual benefit agreement within one week.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Related to Social Order, Suppression is Urgent, National Rice Reaches New High of 90 Yuan Yesterday, Tightening Credit Makes Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Rice merchants hold tea parties and market sales, and dark market trading has been rampant in recent days, with the market extremely chaotic and filled with rumors. After opening at 7:30 AM yesterday as usual, people became more confident, and the order was very chaotic. The rising trend was boiling, and the dark market soared. The Market Management Committee immediately took emergency measures, sending additional personnel to and from the market to monitor the trading of fellow traders. If it is found that the traded rice and grains have not been immediately completed with transaction slips, it will be considered an illegal transaction. Police detectives stationed in the market by the two concession authorities are also closely watching the baseless rumors of the market brokers. Although the general rice speculators have been largely restrained, they are still whispering to each other, attempting to aggressively raise market prices. So-called "scalping" transactions are emerging one after another.</p>
<p>Aggressive Price Increases</p>
<p>However, the Market Management Committee's measures are not an effective way to stabilize rice prices. The committee has a responsibility for illegal transactions such as dark market trading in the market. The two concession authorities have discussed concrete measures to stabilize the entire rice market, but their effective implementation cannot be delayed. Yesterday morning's market trading resulted in a rise of 2-3 yuan per stone, with national rice reaching a new high of 90 yuan. Even better rice and grains could not be purchased. Buyers such as shopkeepers, due to the soaring market prices and tightening credit, are not as willing to buy as before.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Attention</p>
<p>The frequent rise in rice prices means that ordinary people can no longer afford to live, which is related to the entire social order and cannot be ignored. The recent series of labor disputes are also largely due to the rise in rice prices. For the general salaried class, their daily income is unlikely to be able to cope with the minimum cost of living. Therefore, the four million Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai all hope that the two concession authorities will take emergency measures to severely punish rice speculators according to law, enforce the rice market trading rules, deploy additional personnel to be stationed in the market for close monitoring, and order the Rice and Grain Valuation Committee to immediately resume its work, re-evaluate lower standard market prices, and strictly enforce them. Otherwise, the entire rice market in Shanghai will be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Adequate Inventory</p>
<p>Regarding the rice stocks in Shanghai's rice warehouses, they are extremely full. Yesterday, it was learned from the Shanghai Rice and Grain Valuation Committee that the committee had started investigating the rice stocks in the warehouses last Thursday and completed it yesterday, and announced the following: a total of more than 600,000 bags of grain are stored, calculated at 1.25 stones per bag, amounting to about 750,000 stones. Currently, the daily consumption of the city is only about 9,000 stones. Therefore, based on the warehouse stocks alone, it is enough to meet the food needs of the city's residents for three months. The committee has separately reported this to the two concession authorities and relevant rice industry groups for their reference. In addition, Hong Kong foreign rice in storage is being loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai to be sold on the market in a steady stream. The number of national rice arriving in Shanghai is also increasing daily.</p>
<p>Rice Orders Placed</p>
<p>A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned that foreign exchange rates have recently eased, making it possible to match foreign rice prices. Therefore, yesterday, rice merchants first tentatively ordered 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon rice from Jianyuan Foreign Firm (equivalent to 10,000 bags, priced at 80 yuan per bag, equivalent to 160 catties), which has been transacted and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the middle of next month. If the black market exchange rate eases on Monday, another 3,000 tons (30,000 bags) are expected to be transacted.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Resolution, Agreement Reached</p>
<p>The attendees at this negotiation included Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Lvdeng, Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Industrial Affairs Mediation Division, Company Representatives Zhang Delan, Head of Car Affairs, Interpreter Hu Yimeng, and worker representatives (including drivers, ticket sellers, and workers from three departments), totaling 12 people. Both sides exchanged opinions with an open and candid attitude, and carefully discussed solutions. At 6:00 PM, a satisfactory resolution was reached, and the following agreement was established: (1) All workers will receive an increase of 0.35 yuan per person per day in their living allowance (effective from September 1), and other benefits for workers such as rice and grain will remain the same; (2) Wages will be paid for the strike period (that is, the entire salary for September will be paid, but the double wages for the four days during the tram strike will not be paid); (3) Workers will not be dismissed unless there is a major fault; (4) The company will respond to the labor side's 23 articles of the labor-management mutual benefit agreement on September 5, and all workers will accept it.</p>
<p>Notify Workers to Resume Work This Morning</p>
<p>After the above negotiation was satisfactorily concluded, the labor side immediately notified the workers in each department that they would resume work this morning. All 11 bus routes within the concession will be able to operate in full. The 23 articles have been satisfactorily resolved yesterday, and the labor and management will no longer negotiate. The five-day bus strike has thus been completely resolved. It is also learned that the rapid and smooth resolution of this strike was due to the harmonious relationship between labor and management, both of whom were able to act in good faith. Secondly, the efforts of the concession authorities and Mr. Yu and Mr. Yuan to mediate were also important factors in eliminating the strike.</p>
<p>French Tram Negotiations in Progress, Sincere Interaction Will Not Be Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>After the workers of the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th of this month, the workers proposed 16 articles requesting improved treatment conditions, and representatives were officially sent to the company in a letter a few days ago. The company has now translated it into French, and the director and the car affairs director Maxina are studying it article by article. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the worker side yesterday that labor and management will officially start negotiations today, but the time has not yet been fixed. Since today is Sunday, a regular holiday, the negotiations may be changed to Monday. It is reported that the workers hope that the company will accept the workers' demands in order to avoid prolonging and expanding the strike. The company expressed its willingness to negotiate openly and honestly, so the strike at the French Water and Electricity Company will not be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Labor Representatives Visited Mr. Yu Yesterday</p>
<p>The strikes at the French Water and Electricity Company's trams, trolleybuses, and buses have reached three days, and the company's total losses have reached more than 100,000 yuan. In order to seek a rapid solution to the strike, the labor side specially sent representatives to visit Mr. Yu Qiaqing yesterday afternoon to state the labor's difficult living situation and request his mediation. Mr. Yu said that he would proceed after the mediation of the British bus and tram companies was completed. Therefore, it is expected that the transportation strikes in the French Concession will also be developed within the day. It is also learned that Mr. Yu mediated the transportation strikes in the International Settlement from morning to evening yesterday before completing them, so the mediation of the transportation strikes in the French Concession needs to start today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Main Routes Maintain Normal Services</p>
<p>In order to maintain public transportation within the concession, the company tried to maintain traffic under the protection of armed police, although unfortunately incidents occurred, resulting in innocent passengers being injured, the company expressed regret, but for the sake of overall traffic, so yesterday the police still maintained traffic under strict protection, a total of 30 vehicles drove out of Route 2 (Sixteen Pups to Xujiahui), Route 7 (Sixteen Pups to Shanzhong Road), Route 10 (Sixteen Pups to Lujiazhen), not including trailers. Chinese and Vietnamese police officers were stationed at each tram station, and the guard was very strict. However, each vehicle traveled very slowly to prevent accidents, and returned to the factory early in the evening.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Small Denomination Stamps Requires Sufficient Change</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration and its branches have posted notices saying, "It has been found that there is an abnormal shortage of change in the market recently. For all members of the public purchasing stamps, for amounts less than 0.10 yuan, please bring sufficient change. Otherwise, this bureau can only provide stamps of equal value. This is hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Lone Army Commander Xie Hosts Tour, Reports on Details of Incident, Soldiers Work Hard and Are Very Healthy</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army in the Singapore Road camp hosted members of the press and published a detailed account of the incident. His conclusion included four points: (1) This incident was due to a general misconception underestimating the Lone Army. But the Lone Army is a Chinese revolutionary soldier, and they will not hesitate to make any sacrifice to maintain the dignity of a soldier. (2) Our retreat was not surrender. We live here in seclusion, obeying order. All expenses are provided by the government. (3) In solving the current environmental pressures, there are many considerations, and it is impossible to make any demands. Therefore, we are deeply saddened by the comrades who died or were injured. In addition to reserving future negotiations, we will adhere to the government's position and strive to work hard in sports, education, and industry to serve the country in the future. Although there are not many words, the intention is good, and the brave and courageous spirit is admirable. He is truly worthy of being a model soldier of modern times.</p>
<p>Wang Squad Leader's Tomb</p>
<p>He then personally led a tour of the tomb of Squad Leader Wang, who recently died in the incident, which was covered with a fresh wreath. Several soldiers were busy building a small garden around it. He then accompanied reporters to the barracks lecture hall, sports field, and other places. All the soldiers seen were either playing soccer or basketball, galloping in the field. Although their skin was slightly dark, they were all strong and healthy. Mr. Xie told people that since promoting sports, the soldiers have become healthier. Only nine people were sent to the hospital for treatment this year, which shows the remarkable effect of exercise.</p>
<p>Working Hard to Produce</p>
<p>He then led a tour of the workshops where the products were made. In addition to attending classes every day, the soldiers also hired technicians to teach various small crafts, such as knitting socks, rattan work, driving cars, and making soap, so that everyone could learn a skill. The soap and socks produced have been selling well in schools, and the prices are low and the quality is excellent, which has been praised by the general buyers. Mr. Xie also said that he originally planned to imitate toothpaste, but it has been temporarily suspended due to the high cost. Soon after, he entered the cooperative and other places, where the workers were diligent in their work and were respectful to their superiors. Then they said goodbye and left.</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng and Other Banks Reduce Deposit Interest Rates, Limited to Current and Demand Deposits, Many Depositors Switch to Savings Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai banking industry, in view of the sluggishness of industry and commerce, the abundance of idle funds, and the difficulty of using funds, has taken measures to reduce interest rates. Zi Jianye, Jin Cheng, Zhong Nan, Da Lu, and the Four Banks Savings Association, etc., will reduce all interest rates by 0.1% on current and demand deposits, whether in the commercial department, savings department, or trust department, starting from October 1.</p>
<p>Encourage Savings</p>
<p>In order to strengthen production and construction, cultivate thrift and virtues, and promote the National Savings for National Construction Movement, the authorities established the National Savings for National Construction Movement Committee and the National Savings Promotion Committee. After active promotion, savings promotion branches have been widely established in major areas of Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces to organize savings groups in order to widely complete savings promotion, thereby concentrating national financial resources and promoting construction projects.</p>
<p>Savings Opportunities</p>
<p>In order to encourage the public to participate, the authorities have also decided by the General Office of the Four Banks Joint Office to increase the interest on savings certificates and strictly stipulate that savings deposits are only for production and construction purposes. Shanghai is full of idle funds, and the banks have felt that they cannot use the deposits and have implemented interest rate cuts, giving the safe opportunity to transfer local funds from Shanghai. It is reported that various circles are enthusiastically entrusting related organizations to purchase savings certificates for savings.</p>

<h3>Most White Russian Residents Do Not Want to Violate Court Agreements, Dissatisfied with Immigration Committee Setting Up Arbitration Tribunal, Civil and Criminal Cases Should Be Under Jurisdiction of Local Courts</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that the head of the White Russian Immigration Committee in this city, Ivanov, in order to avoid the White Russian residents in Shanghai being placed under the jurisdiction of another court, moved the jurisdiction from the two special district courts to another place, causing disputes, has agreed with the authorities outside the borders to set up another</p>
<p>Arbitration Tribunal</p>
<p>to hear all civil cases of White Russians. It is found that the relevant authorities have recently decided to place these 26,000 White Russians under the jurisdiction of another court, but most White Russians oppose this. According to White Russian officials, this move violates the court agreement and will cause</p>
<p>Many Disputes</p>
<p>Chinese civil and criminal laws stipulate that the courts in the area where the civil or criminal case occurred or in the area where the party concerned belongs have jurisdiction over the parties concerned. If a White Russian residing in the French Concession commits a crime in the International Settlement and is transferred to another place for trial, it is actually</p>
<p>Destroying Criminal Law</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is questionable whether the police departments of the two concessions will transfer White Russians who commit crimes within their borders to be tried outside the borders. And the implementation of civil cases on White Russians will be difficult. Therefore, even if Ivanov and the outside authorities agree to establish an arbitration tribunal and the White Russians judge themselves, the problem of the White Russian residents in Shanghai not being placed under the jurisdiction of the court has not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Former French Concession Supervisor Awarded, Concession Gold Medal, Former Public Works Bureau Supervisor and French Consul General Eugene</h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau Supervisor J. Brediam has submitted a request to the Board of Directors to be released from his duties due to other jobs, and will leave office on the 30th of this month, which has been approved by the Board of Directors. The French Acting Consul General in Shanghai and Acting Chairman of the Board of Directors Duval yesterday specially issued a notice saying that according to Mr. J. Brediam, the supervisor of the Bureau, requesting approval to be released from his duties on September 30, 1940, the contract will be terminated by mutual consent. It has been approved. It is a pity that the supervisor has finally left the Bureau. I hereby express my gratitude in my name and on behalf of all the directors of the Bureau for his loyalty and cooperation in the Bureau. The Bureau also resolved to follow the chairman's suggestion and award the Bureau Supervisor J. Brediam a gold medal of the Concession to reward him for his excellent work in the French Concession. It also announced that the former Consul General Eugene had left office and returned to France. It was found that under his chairmanship, his achievements were remarkable. The Bureau is deeply saddened to hear of his departure from Shanghai, and it was decided to follow the chairman's suggestion and award the French Consul General D. Auge a gold medal of the Concession to reward him for his great achievements in presiding over municipal administration and serving the French Concession during this turbulent period.</p>
<h3>Food Supply at the Ba Xian Qiao Market</h3>
<p>The English Great Beauty Evening Post reports that the Ba Xian Qiao Market established by the French authorities is doing quite well. All the food sold is sold out every day, and there are fresh products, and the supply of eggs and poultry has also increased greatly. Fish is supplied by the Shanghai Fisheries Company. The Russian-run food store, "Gourmet", specializes in supplying Harbin butter or other foods, and also has a large amount of copper coins to provide customers with the need to make phone calls.</p>
<h3>Congestion on Various Sections of the Longhai Railway; Post Office Implements Registration; No Acceptance Before Registration; Resumption of Commercial Parcels on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line</h3>
<p>Following the announcement by the Municipal Postal Administration on the 23rd of this month regarding the resumption of parcel deliveries on the Longhai and Jinpu lines, those rushing to send parcels have caused considerable congestion. To alleviate this, the Administration has implemented a registration system to limit the volume. Anyone wishing to send commercial parcels on the aforementioned lines must first register at the Administration between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM daily. No temporary acceptance of parcels will be allowed without prior registration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to excessive accumulation of commercial parcels destined for Qingdao, acceptance of such parcels will be temporarily suspended starting from the 30th of this month. However, commercial parcels to various locations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line can be resumed from the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Human Trafficking Organization Busted; Details of the Arrest by the Police - Details of the Case Solved by the Municipal Council Police</h3>
<p>From April 7th to 11th of this year, the Police Department of the Municipal Council uncovered a large-scale human trafficking organization, arresting ten male and female kidnappers in the eastern district of the Public Concession and the French Concession. Four kidnapped children were also rescued. The organization was quite extensive, specializing in luring children under eight years old in Shanghai. Sometimes, children playing on the streets were lured away with food by gang members and handed over to female accomplices for safekeeping. Efforts were then made to send them to Xiamen, where an organization run by two Taiwanese individuals would handle the trafficking. Before being shipped out, the kidnapped children were taught by the female accomplices to call them "Mama" in order to deceive police officers during boarding and landing.</p>
<p>Assistance in Apprehension</p>
<p>During the investigation, forty photographs of children were also discovered. These photos were taken when applying for travel permits prior to boarding. Twenty-four of these photos were identified by parents who had lost their children. In addition, a large number of the children's original clothing was seized, twenty-three sets of which were also identified by the owners. To locate the whereabouts of the missing children, the Police Department attached explanations to the photos and sent them to police agencies in Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Macau for assistance.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Cases</p>
<p>The ten male and female kidnappers arrested were found to be involved in over one hundred cases in Shanghai. They were jointly escorted to the Special First Court for interrogation. As a result, on May 9th, one was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, two to fourteen years, and six to fifteen years. One female suspect was acquitted. All the convicts were then transferred to the French Concession Police Department for further investigation. On August 4th, the Police Department sent detectives to Xiamen to work with local police officers to investigate the kidnapped children and apprehend the traffickers.</p>
<p>All Accomplices</p>
<p>On the 10th of the same month, security guards serving on a ship of the Java Shipping Company arrested a woman. The woman was accompanied by two children. Investigation revealed that the two children had been kidnapped in the eastern district of Shanghai and were intended to be taken to Xiamen for sale. Subsequently, the Water Police and the Police Department searched several locations and apprehended four more suspects and rescued four children. Investigation confirmed that these suspects were accomplices of the previous kidnappers. They were sent to court for trial. As a result, two men were acquitted by the court on the 28th of the same month due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>Sales Contracts</p>
<p>Detectives dispatched by the Police Department to Xiamen, in conjunction with local police officers, arrested five male and female suspects and two Taiwanese individuals on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen. They also recovered sixteen trafficked children from Chinese families who had purchased them. In addition, it was determined that some of the trafficked children had already been taken by buyers to Southeast Asia, Rangoon, and the Philippines. Each time these sixteen kidnapped children were sold, contracts were drawn up, with the buyers adopting them as foster children. The sellers would guarantee that the children were their biological offspring and not kidnapped. In reality, the names of the guarantors, intermediaries, and those posing as the children's parents were all fabricated.</p>
<p>Verdict Pending</p>
<p>Five male and female suspects in this case, four of whom have been transferred to Shanghai, while the other one remains in custody by the Gulangyu Island police for continued investigation into the whereabouts of other missing children. As for the two Taiwanese individuals, they have been handed over to the Japanese authorities there for handling. The four male and female convicts who were transferred, along with the three suspects arrested at sea on August 10th, have all been sent to court. The verdict in this case is still pending.</p>
<p>Photos Awaiting Identification</p>
<p>The aforementioned sixteen children have not yet been transferred to Shanghai and will remain there until their families identify their photographs. Currently, the photographs of seven of the children have been identified by their families as having been kidnapped in the two concessions of this city last year and this year. The remaining children's photographs have been published in various Chinese newspapers in this city for identification. In addition, the Hong Kong authorities sent over one hundred photographs of children to Shanghai, claiming that these children were suspected of being kidnapped. However, no one has been able to positively identify them after the photos were published in the newspapers.</p>
<h3>Shi Jiutang's Condition Still Critical; Bullet Extracted Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Jiutang, a lawyer in this city, was shot at his office on the third floor of No. 24 Central Road last week. The bullet entered his face through the nasal cavity and lodged in the back of his head. He was initially sent to Renji Hospital, but because the bullet was lodged in the skull and difficult to extract, his family transferred him to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the bullet was successfully extracted yesterday by doctors using surgery. There was significant bleeding during the procedure, so it is still undetermined whether Mr. Shi's life is out of danger.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explosion in a Gambling Den in Ximen; Four Gamblers Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, a gambling den in Xiyuan, Zhonghua Road, Laoximen, Nanshi, was the scene of an explosion. As gamblers were enthusiastically engaged in their games, a thug suddenly pulled out a hand grenade and threw it inside. With a loud bang, it exploded, instantly filling the room with thick smoke and flying shrapnel. Four gamblers, who were directly in the path of the explosion, sustained severe injuries and collapsed in pools of blood, unconscious. The gamblers, shocked by the sight, fled in panic, screaming and scrambling for their lives. Women and children were knocked to the ground, their cries shaking the heavens, causing utter chaos. Police officers arrived to maintain order and closed the iron doors of the gambling den for investigation. However, the grenade thrower had already escaped without a trace. The four injured were rushed to the hospital in police vehicles for treatment. Their injuries are serious and their lives are in danger. Many others with minor injuries sought treatment at hospitals on their own.</p>
<h3>Gunman in the Gao Xinbao Murder Case Executed</h3>
<p>Gao Xinbao, a prominent figure in Shanghai, was shot and killed on March 15th of this year in front of the Yipinxin Hotel. The murderer remained at large. Despite the efforts of the concession police authorities to investigate, the case remained unsolved. According to a reporter from the Huawen News Agency, the mastermind behind the murder was Sun Shucheng, a notorious gangster in the Caojiabo area of western Shanghai. Sun, also known as "Little Old Third," was the owner of the Fuji Gambling Den, 41 years old, from Zhenjiang, and had a large number of henchmen. On the day Gao Xinbao was murdered, Wang A'er (18 years old, from Funing, Jiangbei), one of his henchmen, carried out the attack. Sun and Wang were subsequently arrested by the authorities in western Shanghai. After repeated interrogations, the two confessed without hesitation. They were executed by firing squad at 3:20 PM on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Xiang Sheng Taxi Hijacked in Western Shanghai Yesterday; Vehicle Recovered; Cause of Hijacking Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:45 AM, a man went to the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company branch station at Zhaofeng Garden on Yuyuan Road, Western Shanghai, to hire a taxi. The company dispatched taxi number 18436, driven by Yan Dezhu (32 years old, from Chongming). After the man boarded the taxi, he ordered the driver to drive to Bailinan Road, Caojiadu. When the taxi reached the location and stopped abruptly, three men suddenly emerged from a nearby shack and approached the taxi. Two of them pulled out guns, forcing the driver to get out of the car. Yan Dezhu, seeing the guns, dared not resist and got out of the car. One of the men temporarily detained Yan in the shack, forbidding him from making any noise. The other two men then got into the taxi and sped away. The driver was released around 1:00 PM. At the same time, the taxi was found on New Singapore Road near Xiede Road. The police are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the hijacking.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have read today's report in your newspaper regarding a tramcar No. 17 of the French Tramway Company which, on the 27th (i.e., yesterday), was bombed with a sulfur grenade at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Pere Robert, resulting in injuries to eight passengers. There are several inaccuracies in the report. As our company bears full responsibility, we hereby issue a statement to clarify the matter. At noon on September 27th, a tramcar No. 17 of our company, heading east from Shanxi, was indeed approached by several thugs posing as passengers at the Rue Pere Robert station. They mixed among the passengers and ignited flammable phosphorus material stored in small glass bottles hidden in their shoes, intending to disrupt public order. However, this small amount of phosphorus could not have harmed anyone. When passengers saw the thick smoke in the car, they all rushed to escape, resulting in a foot abrasion to one woman. As for your newspaper's claim that eight passengers were injured by flying shrapnel, it is entirely unfounded and clearly based on inaccurate reporting. We hereby issue this correction. Sincerely, Shanghai French Tramway Company, September 28th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, etc., Elected as Committee Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Bankers' Association Club yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Over a hundred prominent figures from all walks of life, including Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Zhang Shouyong, Huang Jingwan, Chen Xuanshan, Chen Zhengfan, and Zhang Guoquan, gathered together in a lively atmosphere. The meeting proceeded as scheduled, with Yuan Ludeng as chairman and Zheng Zulin as recorder. The chairman delivered the opening address.</p>
<p>Chairman Yuan Ludeng's Opening Address</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan briefly stated, "Today is the day of the inaugural ceremony of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee. I am deeply honored to be able to participate. The movement to establish a Shanghai Children's Library was initiated by the Shanghai 9th Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee, which in turn was based on the suggestions of two children, Ying Chun-tung and Ying Chun-gao. Therefore, we can frankly say, 'The movement to establish a Shanghai Children's Library was actually initiated by the children of Shanghai themselves. We adults and parents are simply expressing our support, striving to promote, and completing this movement.' The Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee was formed on April 4th of this year, but since no inaugural ceremony was held at the time, we are specifically holding this ceremony today to make up for it. The initial members of this preparatory committee were eleven organizations, including the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, the Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Children's Care Association, and the Shanghai Street Children Education Association. These eleven organizations felt the need to unite with a majority of local comrades to jointly strive for the establishment of a children's library. Therefore, after forming this preparatory committee, they immediately elected seven executive directors, including Hu Zuyin, Huang Jingwan, and Zhang Guoquan, and requested them to find ways to appoint over eighty additional committee members and carefully draft many regulations. They then solemnly invited comrades from many fields to participate in today's inaugural ceremony. From this, we can understand that these eleven organizations absolutely do not want to monopolize the movement to prepare for the children's library, because this is a local issue in Shanghai. Therefore, they want to gather the strength of people from all walks of life in society to jointly promote this movement. Many people have come to participate in the inaugural ceremony today, and I hope everyone can recognize this meaning, express their enthusiastic support, and work together. Of course, there is no easy task in the world, but we must take a spirit of not fearing difficulties to overcome all difficulties. Talking about establishing a children's library may require 150,000 yuan, maybe 100,000 yuan, or at least 50,000 yuan or 30,000 yuan. However, in today's Shanghai situation, the difficulty of raising funds is very clear to everyone. But even though the situation in Shanghai is like this, we don't have to be discouraged. I believe that as long as everyone is willing to work hard, we will definitely achieve considerable success. Our fundraising goal does not necessarily have to be too large. Even if we cannot immediately raise large amounts of donations to build this magnificent children's library, we can use a small amount of money to start on a small scale and then gradually expand and improve. There is a foreign saying, 'Rome was not built in a day.' We Chinese also say, 'To climb high, one must start from the bottom; to travel far, one must start from nearby.' Therefore, I hope that everyone can strive forward, abandon all concerns and worries, and work hard from all aspects to complete the movement to establish a children's library. As for the progress of the preparatory work, because Mr. Hu Zuyin will give a detailed report, I don't need to add much more."</p>
<p>Hu Zuyin Reports on the Progress of Preparations</p>
<p>Hu Zuyin then reported on the progress of the preparations, stating that the movement to establish the Shanghai Children's Library began in March of this year. The Shanghai 9th Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee, in response to the suggestions of two children, Ying Chun-gao and others, specifically initiated the movement to establish the Shanghai Children's Library and donated a total of 3,101.73 yuan at the conclusion of the Children's Day celebration for the establishment of the Shanghai Children's Library. The Celebration Preparatory Committee, at its third meeting on April 2nd, felt the importance of the movement to establish the Shanghai Children's Library and its complex nature. Therefore, on April 4th, it organized the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee to continue all preparatory work and decided to transfer all the funds raised to the Children's Library Preparatory Committee, hoping to rely on the continued efforts of all parties to complete the great goal of establishing the Shanghai Children's Library. The members of the preparatory committee are eleven organizations, including the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, the Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Children's Care Association, the Shanghai Street Children Education Association, the Shanghai Poor Children Out-of-School Relief Center, the Shanghai Parent Education Research Association, the Shanghai Children's Hospital, the China Women and Children Relief Association, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association. At its first meeting, the committee first established a design committee to be responsible for drafting regulations and studying the appointment of additional committee members. At its second meeting on April 26th, in addition to resolving to temporarily use the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association as a temporary office, the committee also elected Huang Jingwan, Hu Zuyin, Zhang Guoquan, Chen Zhengfan, Ding Bingnan, Dong Bin, and Zou Qi as executive directors to be responsible for properly handling various regulations, handling the appointment of additional committee members, and preparing to convene the inaugural meeting. The executive directors selected by the preparatory committee all promoted the preparatory work on a voluntary basis. The regulations stipulated that the entire executive committee would meet once every two weeks, and the standing executive committee would meet once a week. The executive directors extensively searched and collected information, and painstakingly studied and drafted no fewer than eight or nine types of regulations, such as the Articles of Association of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, the Rules of Procedure of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, the Measures for Fundraising for the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, and the Measures for Collecting Books for the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee. In addition, they requested architect Mao Xinyi to design drawings for the construction of the library building and invited library science experts Lin Chongzhi and Lu Shaoyu to design the style of the mobile library car and drafted budget proposals, including draft budget proposals for renting a library site and operating mobile library car services, for the reference of future responsible personnel. In addition, Chen Zhengfan's respected father, Mr. Qiping, passed away a month ago. The executive committee of the Children's Library Preparatory Committee, admiring his moral example, specifically initiated a fundraising campaign to donate funeral gifts to the Children's Library as a permanent memorial. As of September 27, 1940, the Children's Library Preparatory Committee had received 539.60 yuan in funeral donations from friends of Mr. Chen in Shanghai. There are also grand plans for building a mansion, but I will not elaborate further.</p>
<p>Discussion of Motions and Election of Committee Members</p>
<p>Then, the motion was discussed. Ding Bingnan read the draft articles of association, which were passed in principle. Huang Jingwan proposed electing a nominating committee, and the chairman appointed Huang Jingwan, Zhang Guoquan, and Sun Choucheng as nominating committee members. The resolution was approved. The following people were immediately elected (honorary chairman): Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, Wen Lanting, Zhang Shouyong, Mrs. Hemick; (honorary committee members): Wu Yunzhai, He Dekui, Xi Yushu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Jilou, Wang Boyuan, Qin Runqing, Sun Ruihuang, Cai Cong, Guo Shun, Guo Linshuang, Zheng Zhaobin, Chen Bingkun, Ding Fangzhen, Cui Fuzhuang, Zhang Rongchu, Zhu Boquan, Gao Shiheng, Li Zulai, Chen Zhusheng, Zhu Lide, Meng Lu Aide, Yang Nielingyu, Wei Pengdan, Zhou Shoujuan, Yan E'sheng, Li Wenjie, Li Yunzhou, Zhou Jianxue "Sun Choucheng, Dai Chunfeng, Fan Zhengkang; (standing committee members): Yuan Ludeng, Wu Weide, Fu Wenshou, Lu Gaoyi, Dong Renjian, Chen Qingshi, Hu Zuyin, Su Zengxiang, Qiu Liying, Huang Jingwan, Zhang Guoquan, Yun Huaigao, Chen Zhengfan, Ding Bingnan, Ying Yongyu, Lin Chongzhi, Zhu Yutao, Mao Xinyi, Zhang Yuanfu. The resolution was unanimously approved. Finally, Chen Xuanshan, deputy director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, and Kong Minzhong, the former director of the library of Tsinghua University and the Library of the Central Research Institute, who had recently returned from studying in the United States, gave speeches. Their words were earnest and everyone enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>Weekly Supplement</p>
<h3>The Completion of the American Two-Ocean Navy</h3>
<p>What is a two-ocean navy? Simply put, the original operational plan of the U.S. Navy only prepared to concentrate the entire fleet in the Pacific or the Atlantic to maintain national defense. To fight on both fronts simultaneously, the current strength is not enough. Now, the situation in the Pacific is deteriorating day by day, and the British Navy in the Atlantic is busy dealing with Germany and Italy. If the British fleet fails, wouldn't the United States have to deal with both the Pacific and Atlantic at the same time? Last month, the U.S. Congress passed a two-ocean navy bill, deciding to increase the existing naval fleet by 70 percent.</p>
<p>The current U.S. Navy, on the surface, can be considered the most powerful in the world (a total of 1,330,415 tons, with 397 warships of various types). The current U.S. fleet includes 15 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 17 cruisers, 237 destroyers, 102 submarines, and more than 1,300 fighters. According to recent reports, the British Navy has a total of 1,253,744 tons and 336 ships, both less than the United States. Japan, the world's third naval power, has a total of 241 warships, totaling 961,326 tons. The combined navies of Japan, Italy, and Germany exceed the U.S. by 409,323 tons. This is just the surface; no one really knows the number and speed of Japan's secretly built warships. The British Navy may be destroyed by the enemy; if so, when will it be? All this is unknown. The current 15 U.S. battleships can be said to be the most powerful in any navy in the world. However, their average age has reached 23 years. Three of them are too old, and Congress has allocated funds to improve their cannons and armor. Among the 237 destroyers, 109 are "old men" from the last World War and have recently been re-integrated into the fleet. The number of cruisers and aircraft carriers in the United States is far less than that of Britain and Japan.</p>
<p>As for the new ships being built in the United States, they can be divided into three categories: (1) those that have already been designed and ordered, (2) those that have already started construction in the dockyards, and (3) those that are being assembled, that is, the hull has been launched and is being fitted with armor and other equipment. If calculated by the year of completion, the number of new ships is as follows:</p>
<p>1944 - 2 battleships, 7 cruisers, 3 aircraft carriers (1 more in 1945).</p>
<p>The two-ocean navy bill passed by the U.S. Congress in mid-August will increase the existing and planned fleet by 70 percent (1,325,000 tons). After this new plan is completed, the United States will have an invincible navy in the world, capable of dealing with enemies in the Pacific and Atlantic at the same time. At that time, the U.S. Navy will have 1,500 aircraft, 35 battleships (several of which are 45,000-ton super battleships), 20 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 378 destroyers, and 180 submarines.</p>
<p>Currently, major U.S. dockyards are already busy rushing to build ships, but Americans are very anxious and impatiently ask, when will this paper fleet become a reality and float on the sea? Of course, the U.S. shipbuilding plan cannot be completed in three or two months. However, according to Rear Admirals Robinson and Maliel, if the United States focuses its mind, manpower, and money on building ships, it will take until 1946 or 1947 to complete everything.</p>
<p>In the eyes of anxious "landlubbers," this shipbuilding plan is simply too slow. In fact, in the eyes of insiders who know the difficulty of this arduous task, it can be said that they are already catching up at full speed. Several naval dockyards (such as Brooklyn, Portsmouth, Norfolk, Boston, Mare Island, Charleston, Philadelphia, and Pungysampung) are already working day and night. Several private dockyards (such as Newport News Shipbuilding, Bethlehem, Bath Iron Works, Federal Shipbuilding, New York Shipbuilding, and Electric Boat Company) are also very busy building new ships. The three major steel plate manufacturers (such as Bethlehem, U.S. Steel, and Baldwin Company) have already fully processed steel. The steel plate factory established by the Navy Department in Charleston has doubled its output since last year, and will double again this year. Other factories related to shipbuilding are also planning how to increase their production. In short, Americans hope that the military expansion plan will be realized as soon as possible, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Knox are also eagerly hoping that the shipbuilding plan can be completed as soon as possible. A closed-down Cramp shipyard in Philadelphia (which built many ships during World War I) is already planning to reopen. Other shipbuilding plants in the valley, such as Gijide, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Beaumont, Tom Pay, Birmingham, Wakeland, and Wilmington, have been contacted and are ready to start work. Knox has consulted with Hillman of the Labor Defense Committee to send unemployed technicians from the interior to work along the coast. Working hours and wages in the dockyards have been increased.</p>
<p>According to Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chief of Naval Operations, Captain Stark, the new ships built by the U.S. Navy, including the two-ocean navy, are expected to be completed two or three years earlier than originally planned, that is, in 1944. This is really good news for the Americans, but people in military circles hope that all the new ships can join the war before the next naval battle occurs.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the English Channel</h3>
<p>On the 17th of last month, an American reporter accompanied the German army on a three-day inspection of the French coast opposite England. The phenomenon he witnessed proved that Hitler is ready to attack England. Once the opportunity arrives, he will take surprising action again. On the surface, there are few signs that the German army will invade England soon. Many people believe that Hitler intends to invade England, and the German newspapers do not deny this. However, the German army's camouflage work along the French coast is extremely clever. If one does not observe carefully, one would not imagine that the invasion plan is already being arranged. Judging from all the phenomena, Hitler's preparation work is orderly and meticulous. It is not affected by wind direction, climate, or season, and can be launched at any time.</p>
<p>British aircraft often fly over the French coast at night, trying their best to disrupt the German army's preparation work. During the day, there are no longer the busy boats shuttling back and forth in the English Channel as in the past. The reporter drove back and forth along the coast between Ostend and Boulogne for three days, and never saw a British escort ship or a large ship in the Channel. Only two German minesweepers and a small fishing boat sailed forward quietly. In the ports of Ostend, Calais, and Dunkirk, the funnels of ships revealing above the water surface and the vessels stranded on the shallow beaches are everywhere, reminding people of the fierceness of the war at that time.</p>
<p>The airspace over the Channel is quite active. Airplanes soar and fly over, one after another without end. German Messerschmitt fighter planes are often seen flying high and fast like shooting stars. Fiercely armed fighter planes and the heaviest bomber squadrons, loaded with huge bombs, rumble westward toward England. German aircraft formations, divided into nine, eighteen, twenty-seven, and up to fifty or more, soar high in the sky, disappear into the clouds, and return in a moment, like silver fish breaking through the blue sky, re-armed and re-bombing.</p>
<p>On the French coast, only continuous explosions and British anti-aircraft fire can be heard from afar. Half an hour later, the German planes return, either in complete formation or scattered. Occasionally, there are also British fighter planes closely following the bombers, chasing relentlessly, exchanging fierce fire. German fighter planes also suddenly appear, attacking the British planes. In a few minutes, the fierce battle ends.</p>
<p>According to the impression obtained by the reporter inspecting the coast, the German side has heavily fortified its defenses to prevent a British counterattack.</p>
<h3>General de Gaulle</h3>
<p>General de Gaulle of France was originally a military advisor to Renault. On June 24th, he called on his comrades in England to form the French National Committee and organized the French Volunteer Army. The British government fully supported it in economic and other aspects.</p>
<p>According to the Manchester Guardian, the British government recognizes General de Gaulle because he has no political affiliations. The committee is not a "hostile" group to the Vichy government, and its activities are limited, namely, to contact French patriotic soldiers in various places and continue to fight.</p>
<p>According to the Sunday Times, although the French Legion has become a part of the British Army, it still fights under the French flag, as do its naval and air force units. On July 2nd, Vice Admiral Muselier was appointed as the commander of the naval and air forces of the French Legion. On the 8th of that month, the Legion's London office began "recruiting soldiers." In fact, there was no real recruitment, because these French troops were already stationed in British barracks at that time. They were allowed to freely decide whether to return to France or continue to fight.</p>
<p>As for the number of de Gaulle's subordinates, it is uncertain, but it is known that it includes infantry, sailors, and pilots.</p>
<p>De Gaulle is nearly fifty years old and was promoted to general on May 26, 1934. He wrote a book predicting the Franco-German war, and nine out of ten predictions came true. The book has been translated into German. In his book, de Gaulle explained the combat effectiveness of motorized units, saying, "Armored vehicles will be heavily used, and amazing results will be produced due to the evolution of machinery."</p>

<h3>Seeking Knowledge in Life</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Ordinary people think that going to school is the only way to seek knowledge, and some children also think that reading a book is the only way to seek knowledge. Therefore, except for teachers forcing them to do arithmetic, write large and small characters, and memorize books, they do not ask about other things. This is not the proper attitude for us to seek knowledge. If a child truly seeks knowledge, he will never do his homework only because the teacher forces him to, nor will he only read textbooks. Because the knowledge in books is limited and vague. The times are changing rapidly. To be a modern little citizen, these learnings are not enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to seeking some fundamental knowledge in school, we must also seek it in life to find its truth. However, the scope of knowledge in life is very large, and its nature is changeable. If you pay attention at all times, then you will find difficulties and questions everywhere. If you do not pay attention, then you will know nothing, feel nothing, and live in the world in a muddleheaded way, like plants and animals. What use is it to only get some knowledge from books?</p>
<p>Newton invented gravity, Watt invented steam, and many other scientists. They did not all have superior intelligence to others, nor did everyone receive advanced learning. They started researching from questions in life, and after years or decades of hard work, they were able to achieve great careers.</p>
<p>In school, we seek knowledge with the teacher's supervision, which is passive. In life, we seek knowledge and we have to seek it ourselves. I briefly describe the method below:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention at all times: We pay attention to problems in life at all times, whether it is as small as the structure and types of ants and their herding, or as large as the causes and backgrounds of international struggles.</p>
<p>(2) Ask questions: When encountering problems that cannot be solved, ask teachers and parents for guidance and help, or discuss with close friends and classmates, to obtain a correct answer.</p>
<p>(3) Observe carefully: Most children like to catch insects and the like. According to my usual experience, they do not observe them after catching them, but just play with them. When they don't want them, they throw them away. If it happens that these insects are also in the book, they memorize how many eyes and feet they have before the exam, but they forget it after memorizing it. They never want to look at the real insects clearly.</p>
<p>(4) Research: After observing something, you have to research it. Why are the colors of most insects green? Why does a praying mantis have two pincers? Research to find out how it is.</p>
<p>(5) Prove the theory: We compare what we have researched with the book to see if it matches and if what the book says is true.</p>
<p>After this series of procedures, we no longer need to memorize the words in the book. The cause and effect of this matter, the shape of this thing, is as if it is in front of our eyes. At the same time, after developing this orderly habit, it will be much easier to study and handle affairs in the future. Children! Let's quickly build a good foundation for our knowledge, and then expand and enrich it in life to reach the highest point!</p>
<h3>Talking about Posture</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>There is a sitting posture, a standing posture, a reading posture, and a writing posture. In short, all actions have a certain posture. Incorrect posture not only affects physical health, but also has a related effect on mental aspects or work efficiency.</p>
<p>"Sit upright, stand straight, do not bend your back when writing..." I think all of you children have already heard similar words many times. So why am I bringing it up again today? Because the more common things are, the less people know how to put them into practice. Children are like this, and so are adults. The times have fostered bad postures, and it will be difficult to change them after entering society in the future. Therefore, it is even more important for children to have good postures than for adults.</p>
<p>In a book, posture is compared to a watch: "Although the internal mechanism of a watch is excellent, if it is equipped with a concave and crooked case, it cannot keep accurate time. The organs of the body can also fail to perform their duties properly due to incorrect posture of the bones." I hope you can remember this analogy. Modern China needs children with strong physiques, and to have strong physiques, you must start by developing good postures.</p>
<h3>The Monkey and the Walnut</h3>
<p>— Shaonong</p>
<p>One day, a young monkey picked up a walnut on the road. He immediately happily put it in his mouth, but as soon as he chewed it, he frowned, feeling pain in his teeth. So, cursing and scolding, he said, "My mother must have lied to me the day before yesterday, because she said that the taste of walnuts is very sweet. How can I trust the words of the elderly in the future? They often deceive the young." Saying that, he threw the walnut on the side of the road.</p>
<p>At this time, another monkey picked up the walnut and broke it between two stones. So, while eating with relish, he said to the young monkey, "My dear companion, your mother is absolutely right. Walnuts are indeed very sweet, but you must break them open. You must remember that in this world, we can never get happiness without working."</p>
<h3>Typical Children</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Children who are not afraid of hardship are good children, and students who can endure labor are good students. The author has seen that many middle and primary school students on the isolated island still indulge in enjoyment during the tram and bus strikes, and call for rickshaws or "wild chicken" taxis instead of walking. No matter how the rickshaw pullers shouted for exorbitant prices of seven, eight jiao, or one yuan, the students squandered their fathers' hard-earned money and did not care. You must know that walking is the only way to exercise the body and invigorate the muscles. If you cannot endure temporary labor, what prospects will you have for serving society in the future?</p>
<p>The author also read a good article by Mr. Bing Qian, "It's Autumn School Opening Again," which included a paragraph about primary school students. He said... "The international situation is so urgent, and old and new hatreds are intertwined. The responsibility of young people is even greater. During the summer vacation, I (Bing Qian referring to himself) returned to northern Jiangsu to spend the summer and talked with many young people, and felt their irrepressible vigor and vitality. A student who is only fourteen years old has to walk to school fifteen miles away every day, and has never been late. Compared with the decadence of young people on the sea, it is really incomparable..." etc. This primary school student can be called a "typical child"! It can also be said to be a model good student. Children! What are your thoughts after reading this?</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (Sixteen)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Oh! Ke Gan, you must know how interesting it is to work in such a big photography studio as Fox! That morning, when Dad went to the bank to work, he always had to drive us there. There were police officers guarding the entrance of the photography studio, and now they all knew me. But when I started working, they didn't know who I was and immediately stopped me and asked, "Who are you? Where are you going?" At that time, Mom replied, "This is our daughter Shirley Temple. Today she is working in the film 'Stand Up and Cheer' on Stage Eight. This is her entrance pass." So they let us in.</p>
<p>We entered a corner of the photography studio, walked across a narrow bridge, and reached that corner, but had already entered a very fun old village. The houses in the village are all like ordinary houses, built of brownish-brown stones, with high and sloping roofs, with high small windows and quaint old chimneys, but no smoke comes out. Mom said that these are French, German, and Italian houses, and no one lives in them, but they are used as models. But in the purely American part of the photography studio, there are many beautiful small houses where people can live. One morning, Mom pointed to a house and said to me, "Look! Isn't that Lilian Harvey's bungalow very beautiful?" When I looked up, it was really beautiful, all blue and pink, with green grass on both sides, surrounded by a low fence, with no house number on it, but a French name, which I did not know. According to my teacher, Miss Buckland, its meaning is "Dream House." I think that's a good name. Mom often said that this is where my "dream house" finally came true. Do you know why? Because this beautiful house is now for me to live in.</p>
<p>The first big star I worked with was Jamie Dunn. I learned a song and a dance and performed with him in the film "Stand Up and Cheer." But you don't have to be afraid to work with big stars, because they are just like ordinary people. When we practiced dancing, we always had to go to the gymnasium. Sometimes if there were teams of dancers practicing steps there, and there wasn't much space left, then we would go to a stage that wasn't being used. Mom often accompanied me, sitting on the side watching. Sometimes I would glance at her, and she would smile slightly. Sometimes if I missed a step, she would just shake her head with a chuckle. If I was dancing happily and didn't want to rest, she would scold me because she was afraid I was too tired; but I still wouldn't stop unless Jamie Dunn told me to stop, and then I would obey. Every time I practiced singing, dancing, or performing before filming a new film, or when the official filming started, Mom was always watching from the side. I really needed her like that and didn't want her to leave even a step, and I felt that I could do it boldly. If she wasn't by my side, I would feel very lonely and almost burst into tears.</p>
<p>In this film "Stand Up and Cheer," there were many important stars, such as Warner Baxter, John Boles, Madge Evans, Jamie Dunn, and many beautiful chorus girls, and boys and girls of the same age as me, so people didn't pay much attention to me, unlike now when everyone pays attention to me. But later, when this film was screened in the small cinema of the photography studio, Mr. Sheehan took one look and couldn't help but blurt out, "Oh, that little girl stole the film!" Ke Gan, this sentence doesn't mean that I really stole the film. He meant that they didn't value this small role at first, but unexpectedly, I was the best performer in the whole film.</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Sai Jiabao Has a Big Mouth</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Generally, when an artist enters show business, it's like a politician ascending to power; there must be a moving speech. If one remains silent, it proves they lack charisma and have no power to rally support. Recently, RKO Pictures in Hollywood, to expand its cast and select talent, specially hired Swedish actress Signe Hasso, known as the "Second Greta Garbo." Hasso graduated from the Royal Dramatic Training Academy in Sweden, which is like the "Ke Ban" (Peking Opera School) of Europe. She gained fame on stage early in her career. Her husband is a director, and her face resembles Garbo, naturally drawing attention.</p>
<p>Upon taking her post, Hasso spoke of her plans in film with great confidence. She said, "Many believe that in these chaotic times, the entertainment industry can be put aside. This is a very narrow view. In my opinion, in this era of war, artists like us have a significant responsibility because entertainment is not just for amusement; it can promote national spirit and boost morale. I have three conditions for going to Hollywood: (1) I will not act in unconscious films, such as pornographic films, and I reserve the right to modify scripts; (2) The male actors who co-star with me will only be Charles Boyer and James Stewart; (3) I will only work nine months each year, returning to my home country for the other three months to adjust my personal life."</p>
<h3>Li Qinian Stars in Modern Drama</h3>
<p>— Hai Ou</p>
<p>"Southern Beauty" Already Filming</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, "Southern Film Queen" Miss Li Qinian has been very popular with audiences. In the two and a half months she has been in Shanghai, she has completed two historical dramas, "Empress" and "Liang Hongyu." Initially, Li Qinian's contract with Yi Hua stipulated filming modern dramas, so both parties are preparing to fulfill the promise of shooting modern plays.</p>
<p>Li Qinian's performance in modern dramas allows for a greater display of her acting skills. Although she has not acted in Mandarin modern dramas, her performances in Cantonese modern dramas have been exceptionally successful.</p>
<p>Experienced directors say that Li Qinian is best suited for modern dramas. Yi Hua also understands her strengths and plans to make extensive use of her. Therefore, the screenwriting department has been brainstorming to prepare a large number of modern drama scripts for Li Qinian.</p>
<p>Among these scripts is one called "Southern Beauty," a tragedy that satirizes society, which suits Li Qinian's personality in many ways. The story is about a Hong Kong socialite who was once very popular in the South, but later came to Shanghai and suffered from the dark forces of society. A small part of it is similar to "Little Thing" in "Sunrise," but "Southern Beauty" is more realistic and vivid.</p>
<p>"Southern Beauty" is now being filmed at the Yi Hua studio, and Li Qinian's performance certainly lives up to expectations. It is said that a certain theater, due to changing to showing domestic films, has commissioned someone to negotiate with Yi Hua for the first-run screening rights, indicating that modern dramas are beginning to gain momentum.</p>

<h3>Shu Shi Dislikes Film Life</h3>
<p>Shu Shi told a Hai Xing News reporter: "From today onwards, I will no longer make movies." When asked why, he replied, "I feel it's meaningless. My family originally did not support my joining the film industry. My purpose was not to earn a few dollars, but to really act. Now I feel there is no interest, so I plan to complete the two years of law school and perhaps become a lawyer in the future." The reporter asked about the contract, and he replied: "The contract started on September 1st of last year and ends at the end of August of this year. It has already expired." When asked if he was dissatisfied with his treatment, he replied: "With a clear conscience, the company has treated me well, and the remuneration is also quite considerable. I said long ago that my family can still afford to eat. My purpose is not to make a living from this, but to act, to act in a few plays that I can do happily. Now I have no intention of staying in the film industry." When Shu Shi spoke, his intention seemed quite firm. It is said that Shu Shi joined the Green Bird Drama Society after the war and then joined the film industry. Although his history is quite short, his acting skills are not bad, and he has become one of the top leading men after the war. If he withdraws from the film industry, it would be a pity.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Final Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Two People Captured</p>
<p>When I followed Hawthorne, leaving Ya Dong and getting into his car, I felt an indescribable joy and relief. Because this case was developing step by step, successively netting three suspects—Yu Gantang, Lu Jiansheng, and Zhao Boxiong—this mysterious case could finally come to a conclusion; especially the arrest of Zhao Boxiong gave me hope that the case would end immediately, because among these three, he was the most suspicious and violent. The fact that he had shot at Hawthorne was also obvious evidence. Unexpectedly, my triumphant mood did not receive any confirmation from Hawthorne. After he started the car, his face was very calm, his hands gripped the steering wheel, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, and the muscles on his face were tense. I examined him carefully but could not find a trace of relief in his heart. I couldn't help but be surprised, because his expression was completely contrary to my expectations.</p>
<p>Once, I couldn't help but ask, "Hawthorne, what do you think of this case? Isn't it about to end?"</p>
<p>"Far from it." His gaze remained fixed on the road ahead, and his voice was cold.</p>
<p>I said in surprise, "Far from it? What do you mean? Isn't this person the main culprit?" Seeing him looking at the dashboard without answering, as if he hadn't heard, I asked again, "Then, did you find anything in 556?"</p>
<p>He replied curtly, "Nothing. Don't say too much; it's not easy to drive right now."</p>
<p>The driving he was referring to was, of course, the car. It was lunchtime—the time for writing letters—and the streets were indeed flowing with traffic. He forbade me to speak, as if on the grounds that talking too much would distract him and cause an accident. In fact, I felt this was clearly an excuse. His driving skills are excellent. He can drive and chat in noisy areas. I have experienced this many times. Now he is using this reason to prevent me from asking questions, which I cannot hide from. Strange, now that the case is progressing smoothly, why does Hawthorne seem even more serious and tense? (121)</p>
