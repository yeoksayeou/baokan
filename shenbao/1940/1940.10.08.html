<h3 id="c6">日本對美與對蘇 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>日本在參加德義集團，簽訂三國盟约之後，對美國雖再三播弄威脅性的論調，並企圖以承認美國在西半球的領導地位，換取美國的承認所謂「大東亞新秩序」，足見迄未放棄其不絕如縷的癡願；然謂日本當局至今以為美國國策有動搖餘地，美日國交有挽救方法，則又必癡不至此。他在目前，不再從外交途徑作何努力，而惟覷準了美國競選總統的前夕，向美國散佈戰爭的恐怖，以利用孤立分子，强化孤立意識，抨擊羅斯福氏；以冀美國總統或易人，而後任或竟變更國策。其實，美國對遠東，對自身的安危利害，雖在政爭上取為爭論的資料，却並不因朝野兩黨的對立而在見解與態度上有何根本的分歧；故無論美國下月改選的結果如何，日本所作萬一之望，終必歸於失望，不但如此，美國進一步的決定與行動，在一般情况之下，固得觀察為殆將等待競選總統終了之後；然國際種種時機的緊張與重要，自來莫過於目前，凡關政治與外交的舉措程序，實亦未必如一般觀察方法而竟有待於他日；但看最近突然召集海軍後備士兵，既得略見端倪。日本方面當然亦能洞鑒及此，故對美國儘作種種嘗試，而所殫思竭慮的，還在設法怎樣調整對蘇聯的國交。日本的排擊美國，除了正面作用之外，在另一種意味上，亦即所以示好於蘇聯。</p>
<p>三國盟的在公開的條款之外，是吾別有秘密附件，密件如何內容，皆不可知；祇就公開條款的表面而論，盟的所規定的，僅是原則；原則應無所不通，却獨舉蘇聯為例外。故從方式上加以析辨，假定任何他國，幫助英國對德義作戰，或幫助中國對日本作戰，則德義日三國即將根據盟的而互助；假定蘇聯助英或助華，則因盟的有三國保持對蘇關係的規定，甚可解釋為對蘇不適用盟的互助的原則</p>
<p>這一解釋，是理論的方式上所容許的。雖事實上是吾應用，繫於蘇聯的行動；而究竟如何解釋，當然亦是極權國的極權之一，事前小必申論；然三國對蘇聯的示好與忌憚，則因盟的有此一條規定而情不可掩。三國僉同，日本殆更甚。日本首相近衛日前所發表談話之中，對美國表示其悻悻，這在盟的表面的原則上，並無如此特別悻悻的必要；然談話中同時父特別對蘇聯提出國交調整云云，美蘇相提並論，是不能不看做以美國為襯托，亦即特別對蘇聯示好。原來蘇聯對日本，亦以為調整國交非不可能，其外交委員長莫洛托夫氏往嘗公開言之。兩國當局表示若此，而近衛又聲稱「今在政治上經濟上與蘇聯調整國交，現正進行中」，從知其間必有所醞釀。醞釀未必一無結果，但在日本所可獲得的，大的是三國盟的之外的又一疑問。蓋蘇聯是太平洋濱的一個權威國家，到現在為止，尙未流露過願意參預太平洋紛爭的意向；再從三年來所援助中國者看來，蘇聯又絕不會贊成日本向東亞大陸恣行侵略；這兩條界綫之間的空間，即是蘇聯認為「蘇日調整國交非不可能」的所在吧！日本對蘇聯，自始巴望蘇聯容忍日本的侵略東亞大陸　停止蘇聯的對華援助，這是近年日本希望所謂調整對蘇國交的主旨所在；直釗現在，日本還未必放棄這一願望；此其終於失望，自不待論。及至近衛再任閣揆，乃至最近三國盟的締結後，美國方面的反應，說明了美一國非但不為盟的所喝退，且因盟的的刺激而更趨積極：於是日本所期待的調整蘇日國交，其內容主旨，殆將發生重大變化。簡單的說，日本的對美關係，既極艱險，便不得不為了太平洋風波而忌憚蘇聯，示好蘇聯。故既往的日本所謂對蘇，以對華為重心；今後的對蘇，或將以對美為重心。我們對於美日紛爭，自有一貫的認識；然猜想蘇聯的見解，必與我們不盡同。我們以為中日戰爭是侵略與反侵略的戰爭，而美日間是民主與極權的衝突，是文明幸福與武力權威的衝突。在蘇聯，完全同意於中日間的侵略與反侵略戰爭，且始終同情於反侵略；而對於美日糾紛，殆將視為可能的發展至帝國主義間的對等戰爭，亦即將未來的太平洋風波，視同當前的歐洲戰爭。就這一點而論，現在的日本對於蘇聯，未始不希望做到蘇德之間的類似狀態吧！所小同的，蘇德和好之後，德國强化了對英作戰的決心；倘若蘇日和好之後，日本祗是强化其對美恐嚇的恣態而已；因為到現在為止誰都不能置信於日本對美除恐嚇，希望嚇退美國之外，已經準備了對美作戰。</p>

<p>英國法西斯派也有通敵的跡象，還有許多間謀是共產黨徒。他們受了莫斯科的指使，在兵工廠中鼓動風潮，傳播此次戰爭無非帝國主義衝突的理論。</p>
<p>法西斯派份子專門從英國上流社會覓取情報。在社會地位方面，他們可以在上流社會活動，共產黨則不然。據本年初的統計，英國境內居住着六萬敵國僑民，被監禁的不到一千人。英國此種寬大行動，在生死存亡的戰爭中也許行之過久了。其結果因有好多危險的間謀漏網。英國也收容了幾千難民，大部分是受過敎育的捷克人與波蘭人，這些人因為窮困不堪，有時不免被人收買。</p>
<p>迨至目前，英國還有二萬德僑居住境內，加上英國的法西斯派份子及共產份子，自能組成勢力雄厚的便衣隊。英國第一次嚴格對付便衣隊的辦法，是將住居東部和南部海岸的敵國男子　千名拘禁起來。在上述區域內的中立國。或友邦僑民也應每日向警署報吿，並不得乘汽車或自行車。他們應在每晚八時以後，早晨六時前，留在家中，不得出外。陸軍大臣艾登並會組成民團，巡察各區。其主要目的厥在防止傘兵及便衣隊的狼狽為奸。</p>
<p>五月杪，英國又將各地敵國僑民四千人分別監禁。</p>
<p>同時還通過，懲治內奸條例，規定陰謀，怠工，阻撓軍事，偵探軍情，及在內部助敵等犯，皆處死刑。小規模的搜抄國內法西斯派及共產黨人的行動，作在進行中。原來婦女被監禁者不到二百人，但德軍佔領荷蘭，有好多女間謀島內應，英國因亦注意到此種危險。婦女被監禁的L有幾人。英國法西斯派首領穆斯萊夫婦也已身入囹圄了。</p>
<p>美國偵緝處長胡佛</p>
<p>雜，同時也非常嚴重。雖則愛爾蘭所有三個政黨都巳聯合起來防止叛國行動，可是杜伯林京城內德國使館的德國人。巳有機會與愛爾蘭共和軍聯絡。到無可如何的時期，也許英國軍隊要佔領愛爾蘭主要海口，以策安全。</p>
<p>美國是吾也有間諜恐慌呢？據美國偵緝處長胡佛說確是有的。卽使美國只有一個間諜，仍能為害美國。卽使他獲得一件國家秘密，也足以危害美國無數國民的安全。拿破崙的間謀機關只有一個人主持，不過那一個人所接觸的人範圍自然很廣大。所有間謀活動情形都是大同小異的。有史以來固然是如此，現代的情形，亦復不能例外。</p>
<p>美國有些人外面固持鎭靜，謂討論間諜恐怖為無聊。不過美國境內如無間謀活動，秘密飛機圖樣又怎樣被竊的呢？叛國的海軍軍官又怎樣將海軍秘密出賣的呢？美國偵緝處自一九三九年九月以後，曾接到不少間諜活動與怠工的報吿。</p>
<p>一九三八年以前五年，偵緝處每年平均要解決三十五件間諜怠工及國防秘密洩漏的案件。到了一九三八年，此項案件不下二百五十件，一九三九年，一躍而至　千六百五十一件。目前更多。這自然不是可安心的情形。</p>
<p>間諜與怠工有聯帶關係。發生開謀時，也必發生怠工。間謀的範圍已擴大，已不僅限於軍事秘密。間謀已深入美國工商及社會各方面。怠工的情形亦然。據偵緝處調查，美國有着這些外來的陰謀者，他們不惜以危害美國來報答美國的優待。最近未得政府許可而卽出賣給外國的幾百尺影片，除開視為間諜的活動外，別無解釋。這一類影片係將美國空車根據地皆攝入鏡頭。別國得了這項影片。可以按圖索驥，將炸彈從空中，準確地擊中其所欲擊的目標。這些影片，後經發現，確可威脅美國的安全。此不過一例而已。其他還有　多事關國防秘密，不能公開討論的間謀活動，也已在美國發生。間謀機關對於美國國防計割的進　，正不遺餘力地在探索。羅斯福總統曾於去年九月六臼籲請美國各地官廳與聯邦偵緝處合作，嚴厲防止間謀怠工等活動。那時他曾命令偵緝處調查此項事件，並命令增加一百五十個特別偵探，指定專款，以增加工作的效率。</p>
<p>上次大戰　生時，美國悄報　關極差。聯邦偵緝處剛在萌芽時代。目前情形已　變。海陸軍情報部都巳組織完密，效率大增。聯邦偵緝處羽毛也巳豐滿了。</p>
<p>偵緝處為使應付目前局勢起見，巳在阿拉斯加，波多里谷及夏威夷各地，派駐偵探，嚴密監視美國國防前哨地帶。</p>
<p>聯邦偵緝處並已在美國六個新城市，設立機關，使軍事上軍要的據點，可因增加的特別偵探的援助，而更得一種防範。</p>
<p>去年夏初，聯邦偵緝處已設專科，敎授偵查間謀及怠工的專門知識。除此之外，美國陸軍海軍兩部又飭令該偵緝處保護幾千所工廠，該工廠却與政府訂合同，趕造軍備。</p>
<p>總之，上次大戰的敎訓，美國人尙能憶及，目前正在嚴密戒備之中。（完）</p>

<p>英總司令由港抵滬英國駐華艦隊總司令諾貝爾大將、係於最近卸任者、據平明社記者咋向關係方面探悉、諾貝爾大將於日前山香港啟程、業於前晚抵滬、昨向英國駐滬官方探詢時　承認諾貝爾大將來滬係經滬回歸英國倫敦者、惟據最先吿平明社記者關於諾貝爾大將來滬消息之關係方面所知、諾氏來滬、諒係與赫德上將會晤、共商英美遠東艦隊之合作、故此次諾氏回國、經上海而往美國、恐亦將與美國海軍當局亦有所接洽、然後由美返英、惟上述所傳、尙難獲英美兩國駐滬官方之設實、但諾氏來滬意義之重大、則為各方所一致深信、</p>
<p>美後備兵整裝待發</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、華盛頓方面昨（六日）下動員令、召集海軍後備兵入美艦隊服務後、旅滬美海軍後備兵约五十人、今日（七日）正待應召出發之令、其中若干人今晨謂、彼等明日（八日）諒可接確切命令云、聞此等海軍後備兵、皆不致入美海軍長江巡　隊服務、衆信少數後備兵小久或將調入美艦奧古斯泰號、立卽服役、預料其餘後備兵將接令返美國、或不致登艦赴海上服務、而在岸上擔任繁重工作、聞目下放滬美僑屬海軍後備隊者五十人中、有兩人患病臥醫院、病勢甚危、其餘四十餘人、泰半僑滬已久、其在朱葆三路等處設咖啡館與酒排間者、或在其中充常侍者、頗不乏人、</p>
<p>引起上海異常關切</p>
<p>字林報云、美國海軍部昨（六日）宣布召集L編成之艦隊及陸戰隊全體後備兵一節、巳在上海引起異常之關切、估計僑居滬埠之美國艦隊後備兵、共约一百人、其中若干人、僑滬多年、經營商業、若輩將否遵華盛頓命令而入伍、官方尙無聲明、致令人揣測莫次、</p>
<p>發動員令在預料中</p>
<p>惟昨日華盛頓來電、卽謂海軍部以巳動員海軍全體後備兵、僅志願後備兵除外、則預料美海軍部命令、亦將適用於僑居遠東之美海軍巳編成後備兵、據旅滬美艦隊後備隊人士表示、彼等認為動員令之發出、非出意外、蓋本年所舉行每年一度之海軍後備兵體格檢騐、志在分配後備兵等級者、執行之嚴異乎尋常，且上海前巳微聞美海軍將召集後備兵之風說也、</p>
<p>官方對此並無意見</p>
<p>又上海泰晤士報云、關於美海軍召集後備兵、記者除晤美國亞洲艦隊某員探詢外、且進行調查、惟美海軍部此令對於僑居上海或遠東各處美海軍後備兵之影響如何、目前仍屬疑問、美官方人士對此、並無確定意見、據稱、除此間已接之電訊外、彼等並其他消息、</p>
<p>退伍官兵亦將被徵</p>
<p>查美海　領恩俸之退伍官兵、旅滬者頗不乏人、衆信其中若干人或將被召入伍、美海軍軍官對於此點、亦拒不置評、惟一般相信此輩退伍海軍官兵、大都巳逾軍役年齡、故美海軍部今此召集後備隊一舉、苟在上海方面實施、則退伍官兵被召入伍者、為數必不多、至於旅滬美僑、屬於海軍他級後備隊者、將有若干人被召人伍、亦未能確知、據非官塲方面意見、其數亦頗有限、</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、以市上所傳關於國內外種種消息　均屬利於賣方、故烚赤跌風猛烈、外匯步鬆未已、是以人心復虛、各方供給奇殷、英美金鎊終跌三元、英金票初尙平穩、終落一元、美金票軋跌四角三分、香港票供給不絕、價跌九分、新加坡·及羅比·坎拿大·菲列濱等票、均不乏供售者、市價一致下落一角、日金票稍有轉機、市價回漲一分晚市升為一元四角五分、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍為一元一角四分、</p>
<h3 id="c82">紗花　實銷有限　紗價不穩　大上落之市面　無非為投機造成 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>上週大漲之紗市、昨則轉呈在上在下之局面、此種情况、全係投機熱造成之、但人心大致看升、無奈外匯奇長、而黃金大跌、以致浮多不安、一般搶帽子之輩、叢集市塲、專門抱趨炎附勢主義、所以一漲再漲、一跌更跌也、至於實際情形、除香港帮稍有需要外、其他靜默如常，今日有棉紗一千六百十五件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、市上人氣仍緊張、二　十支雙馬首盤做一千一百九十元、開一個並頭盤、此價一開、買聲如雷、賣者竟束手不敢叫喊、直上至一千二百十六七元高峰、一見外匯放長、金價下墜、同時藍鳳標準紗又傳說已停扳、一時風聲鶴唳、人心惶惶、又作庸人自擾、一霎間跌至一千一百六十五元、此時巳近十一點外、浮空起來扒補、又見回升一步、至一千一百七十五元收盤以後再小十元、查半日間成交統計五千八百八十五包、茲將各帮口買去額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情形、較上週末為遜、此因紗價旣跌、而外滙長勢殊烈、以致人心渙散、廠方需要又滯、惟同業互相買賣、皮球交易、尙稱不惡云、今日有棉花六百三十包運香港、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况頗呈活躍之狀、後因現貨交易之良好、及海外棉商之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日又漲三五磅音、印度昨日連同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、邇來日見活躍、棉價不因匯兌之鬆長而廉、反形步漲、較之上週售價，又漲四五元不等、同業間竟有無從購買外棉之苦、一般之心思異常濃厚、故預料最近之將來、原棉仍將上漲也、</p>
<h3 id="c84">糧食　洋米大批可到　昨市原包已大跌　親粳類到貨亦旺 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>洋米源源而來、太古公司太原輪前日（六日）到滬、由香港裝來六百包、又岳州輪亦於六日到埠、由香港運來四干五百四十六包、昨日又有太古公司濟南輪自香港運來六百二十二包、怡和洋行富陞輪亦由香港裝來一千五百包、昨巳分別起卸、革前日本欄所載洋米進口內、太古公司太原輪、自香港裝來洋米七千零五十九包、太原係頴州輪、裝來之洋米私七千九百三十九包、并此更正、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米早晨開市恢、實銷舖作因連日價落中納胃甚呆、昨以市價平正略有問津、因此高次各洋米均見帶緊、且行囤大戶亦乏吐出、市面似有站定之象、繼因外匯再鬆、洋米定價再見劃低、且定貨巳有九千噸併裝法輪開出、香港裝出之途貨不日可到、兼因杜米新粳尖到頭絡繹、因此人心一致向下、午前由堅轉疲、立小三荒角、午後再削五六角、回籠原包之英華司更為軟弱、上週開八十二元之銀行棧二號西貢昨乃降開七十九元、洋棧貨則午後降至七十七元半、均見瀉跌三元左右、而現洋米昨全日亦小去一元之譜、一號西貢七十一二元至七十元、二號六十六七元至六十五元半、小絞六十三四元、暹羅二號六十四元半至六十三元、火紋高七十二元半至七十二元、大市七十元五角至六十八元半、米茶五十六七元，</p>
<p>厚薄破粳已成失令寒蟬、存貨卽將吿罄、市上已疏疏鮮見、而開價亦乏一定標準、祇南港早稻售八十元耳、</p>
<p>新粳尖河下及脚踏車運到者續有二千餘石、其中以洋尖為最多、粳米與杜尖則有限、而窰種大都為西塘一帶之貨、身骨潮軟、不堪久置、所以窰種售意獨鬆、而作客納胃亦屬零星、致價驟跌二三元、開自八十二元至七十九元、新粳去路頗廣、反增一元、特別八十元、中關七十七元、羊尖平平六十四元、革六十二元、杜尖貨鮮胃香並升一二元、高自六十九元次至六十六元、糯米國洋兩貨均以銷塲平淡、而貨主亦無意急脫、未起變化、仍開金溧特元七十二元、常丹七十一元七十元、香港元七十一二元、次至七十元左右、</p>

<p>麵粉交易不旺、局勢頗緊、蓋以現粉愈軋愈缺、各廠一時尙不願增加產量、致本街零售、每多向隅、暗售每包十九元之高價、咋日回籠貨老車粉開過三車、價達十八元五角、竟與客盤相等、故零售乃有此高價也、又聞洋粉以定貨未到、現底不充、大都扳守、價亦暗升二三不等、市面尙在邁進中、</p>
<p>小麥昨日來源頗稀、因邇來途次運輸時遭某方阻得、且被廠方限價收買、各販戶相率觀望、存底亦漸寥薄、執貨者互相扳守、聞送入租界貨喊價須二十七元、但未正式成交、其零星解廠、則仍照原盤作價云、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨市遽因多頭出　而跌、但以逢小抵補者頗多、收盤時仍稍稍回好、然乙戊兩種於上午尙一度見新高價、因丙種抽籤逼近、一般不願看抽籤者紛紛賣出、以掉換其他各債、日來丁種極為堅悄、戊種市價與丙種相差無幾、卽其出丙入丁或戊之證明、中國目下處於無往不利之環境中、今更有美國封鎖太平洋之說、形勢愈覺有利、債市本身仍當看好也、昨日上午初開甚堅、丙種漲至九元四角、入後聯益怡泰德孚信昌等多頭出籠、遽又回小三五角、乙種曾見六十一元二角新高價、戊種最高曾見五十九元新高價、多頭湧售形勢頓差、午後散戶賣出最多、二十五號賣出極湧、潤德信昌信孚均有賣出、但聯益巳經　回做多、久豐益記同康同順仁昌及鴻大等均在吸收、再小三四角、故結果一致續跌一角半至六角半不等、成交總數共計的二百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於咋日衆業股市開盤、適如一般人所料、趨勢柔軟非凡、入後人心愈虛、價格愈軟、終於引起在烈跌風、來勢洶湧、大有一發不可收拾之概、一方面多頭思保留其一部份「殘餘利潤」、而减輕其所持、一方面拋空者復推波助瀾、盡量傾塞、市况欲其勿墜、亦戛憂乎其難、收盤潛勢仍極虛軟、各股下瀉原因、由於各種「壞消息」者半、由於大衆心理上之恐懼者又半、但依目下情勢、多星期之蓬勃時期、暫時巳成過去、市况似又轉向另一面矣、</p>

<h3 id="c91">從「內子「說起 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 人章</p>
<p>一直到今天為止，中國還沒有脫出「重男輕女」這個社會思想範疇，也就是說，中國還保持着男子為中心的社會。正如大家所知道的，一般人稱丈夫為「外子」；稱妻子為「內子」；從這是可以得出道樣的一個結論：男人可以參加社會各部門活動，不受限制；而女子則袛有在家庭的小天地里，做些事情。</p>
<p>這樣，幾千年來，就造成了如是的一個局面：女子巳失却了人的獨立性，她已像奴隸屬於主人與牛屬於農夫而成為男子的附屬物，她依靠男子而活，她的命運隨男子命運的轉移而轉移。</p>
<p>是誰決定這個的呢？是社會！社會憑什麽理由來命令女午成為「內子」呢？</p>
<p>事實終究是事實，並不是女子「不堪重負」，而是社會主觀地認為她們是「弱不禁風」；另一方面也是由於女子的社會地位被限制，而相常影響了女子在體力，智力方而的發展與進步。然而就是在這種社會阻力之下，我們還可以發見女子的能力在各方面的表現：花木蘭，秦良玉衝過鋒，陷過陣；武則天（暫不管她好醜）亦會像其他男人一樣的統治過中國；而民國以來，更有不少女政治家露面，就最近講，的後方都有女子參加工作；而西北公路假使沒有半數左右的婦女參加，恐怕至今還難通車吧？</p>
<p>所以結論非常顯明：假使我們承認女子也是人的話，那末我們應該無條件地來尊重其獨立性；因為每個人都有其生存的自身意義與價値。另一方面，假使社會能有機會給予女子以參加活動的機會的話，那末女子在起先也許跟不上男人，但在長期的過程中，進步是可預卜的。至於女子要生產，撫養孩子，這祇是一個技術問題，因為女子參加社會工作的數量逐漸增多起來的時候，托兒所，嬰孩院，幼稚院也會普遍地增加起來的。</p>

<p>— 萬家春</p>
<p>珂：</p>
<p>你看到我的歪斜的筆跡，像酗酒的流浪人的脚步，是應該感到陌生了吧？</p>
<p>當我望着碧空的行雲，我就想起一個遙遠的友人。她好像一抹斜暉，射在雲端，便是美麗的霞彩，望之非常灼熱，但手觸到的却是陣陣晚風。怎不敎人回過頭去，思念慈母，給我一件寒衣加添在心房！</p>
<p>秋風又掃着落葉，想起我們的相識已一年了。法國公園的秋陽照着你黑地白點的新夾衫，一種飄逸　灑之感深印在我的腦際。</p>
<p>處在逆流的環境中，却肩住黑暗的閘門，憧憬於光明的遠景，正是你的優良的質素。但是，缺點也有，正像你自己所指出的一切。要克服吧，當然咯，頭腦還得冷靜一點，認識還得淸澈一點。</p>
<p>偶然的機會使我和一些哥兒們在古老的泥土上相見，他們有的是資本家的兒子，有的是百萬富翁的女兒。他們的爺娘，不缺少一般的所謂慈愛」，想把他們養在暖房裹不經受一些風霜雨雪。然而，然而呵，他們撇開了當裕的生活，却到貧瘠的泥士上，去流辛勞的血汗。呵，朋友，這固然是一種奇蹟，然而又是多麼的現實呵！</p>
<p>歷史是殘酷的，它不管父母們的悲傷，它無視於報紙上淚水濕透了紙背的尋人廣吿，它更不顧惜悄人們的愁眉百結，歷史老人的車子載着一批批的優秀的靑年奔向祖國的懷抱。然而，一個新的幸視的社會的孕育與產生，豈僅這些離情別緒所能交換？還得支付更多的代價呢！</p>
<p>聽說雲巳在做事，不知近狀怎樣？她自稱「好好先生」，我是大為反感的。因為「好好先生」者，決不會嫉惡如仇，充其量，只能做到獨善其身而己。然而天下決不會存在旣不作惡也不與惡勢力鬥爭的「中庸」者，好好先生者，在這種社會上，結果往往還是做了作惡者的附庸！</p>
<p>上海成為孤島，不但房屋感到人滿之患，馬路擠滿了行人，連「言路」也狹窄了，就此止步吧。</p>
<p>祝你健康呵！　春</p>

<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>余甘棠說到這未了幾句話時，不期然而然地現着一種聲色俱厲的姿態，好像一個戰塲上的勇士，正要準備跟敵人肉搏的樣子。霍桑凝視着他，　角上的微笑逐漸地消散的變得很嚴肅了。我　他沉默的機會，又不禁向這放浪的少年直言申斥。</p>
<p>我冷冷地說：「好一個勢不兩立！好勇氣！你知道這是個什　時代？你負着什麽使命？如果你把這種勇氣用來應府一切艱難的學問，人羣的福利，和人生途程上的一切困難問題，那我不能不向你致敬。現在你想想，你的勇氣用在什麽方面呢？這袛是一積單純的——還談不到戀愛——色情問題，你却竟漠視了生命，名譽，父母，國家，準備拚着命云自殺殺人！」我自己覺得這幾句話也說得不無過火，但實在是由於「情不自禁。」</p>
<p>霍桑雖不發言，却是一聲長嘆，分明對於我的插嘴也表示同情。</p>
<p>那少年的「聲色俱厲」，一剎那巳糙得聲色俱怯」了。他已沒有勇氣瞧我，答話時的聲浪也顫動得厲害。一　先生，我　在巳知道這是錯誤的吾則我也不會來見你。不過我實在沒有殺人。霍先生，你到底相信我嗎？</p>
<p>霍桑旣不接受，也不吾定，仍自顧自說這：「你說下去。昨夜你自己的行動，還不曾解釋明白。」</p>
<p>余甘棠答道：「好，我吿訴你。昨夜我陪一個同學在金都戲院看電影，散出來後，吃了些點心，我陪送伊回去——」</p>
<p>「伊？是個女同學嗎？——唉，你眞忙哪！好，說下去。」</p>
<p>「我們雇了一　汽車，會經過麗閘家的門口。我曾瞧見趙伯雄，伏在那門外的短牆外面。」</p>
<p>霍桑又突然剪住他說：「你瞧見的？——那是什麽時候？」</p>
<p>余甘棠略　躇了一下，答道：「大槪在十二點左右。因為電影院十一點半不到就散。吃點心也躭擱不到半個鐘頭。</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。「好，你說得仔細些。你的確瞧見趙伯雄，不會錯誤嗎？」（一三〇）</p>

<p>— 新聲</p>
<p>否極泰來晚運享通</p>
<p>有一年，大概是民國十一年吧！小孟七在二馬路老天蟾舞台打泡，劇目是「八搜鄒應龍」，做得相當火暴。同時登台的　角，就是現在大走紅　的芙蓉草，他登台那天，可是沒有戲碼，僅僅在八搜鄒應龍那齣戲裹面，去了一個不很重要的鄒夫人，他地位雖不重要，但是他的演出，却非常精采，最後鄒應龍將入水牢逃走一塲，芙蓉草的表演，更是熱烈火熾，有聲有色，當時我看了這齣戲，認定芙蓉草是似有藝術天才的好角色，將來非大紅不可。那知後來天蟾舞台改變了作風，拿新編的本戲「狸貓換太子」來做號召，這一來，把芙蓉草生生地給糟蹋了。在狸貓換太子劇中的主要角色，不消說，當然第一是常春恒，第二是劉筱衡，次要的還得挨到孟鴻茂的安樂王，劉玉琴的李妃，和劉松亭的郭槐，芙蓉草的西宮娘娘劉妃，祇好算是第六名進士，這麽　塊好料，連劉筱衡劉玉琴都抵不過，豈不委屈煞人？而且芙蓉草去的劉娘娘，在劇中是　個壞坯子，觀劇的人，對劉娘娘都起惡感，允其是一般無知識的婦孺。當時我有幾個親戚是狸貓迷，他們看了戲回來，總說芙蓉草是不好的，其實是劉娘娘不好，那裹是芙蓉草不好？可是為了這個原故，芙蓉草的聲名，亦就漸漸地冷落下去，狸貓狸貓！可眞把芙蓉草害苦了。</p>
<p>等到常春恒出了天蟾，包公一脚，山小孟七庖代，狸貓風頭，就此日漸衰落，到了二十三本，巳成强弩之末，不久就此停止排演，狸貓末運　到，芙蓉草却從此吾極泰來了。多少女人在自趨毀滅之途。誠如劇作者言：女人如都不　志薄弱，男人也無法引誘了。報載上官雲珠小姐曾為愛好虛榮，被國聯放棄，今上官雲珠小姐親自主演此劇，其亦有動於中吾？</p>

<p>上官雲珠飾胡佩英，胡楚珊雙角。以飾胡楚珊較飾胡佩英為活潑，冷靜飾胡太太，第一幕與末幕化裝似嫌太年輕，四五十崴的決不能化裝得那麼年輕，台詞很流利，為是劇表情最好的一個。林芬的張媽，少痰的胡佩華，極能刻劃個性。紅薇的錢太太亦為該劇生色不少。程櫻飾趨綺文，麗衡飾田秀麗，及小慧飾女僕，僅司云稱職而巳。</p>

<p>Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Songgram, in an interview yesterday with a reporter from "Thai Newspaper," stated that Thailand has the possibility of joining the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact. When the reporter asked about Japan sending a special envoy to Bangkok, the Prime Minister replied that the Japanese envoy's visit to Thailand is solely for investigating economic issues. However, Thailand has already studied the goals of Germany, Italy, and Japan and believes that they share the same objectives and that cooperation is possible. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Britain and America to Establish New Naval Defense Line in the Pacific: US Authorities Will Not Fear Any Threats and Will Continue to Aid China and All Democratic Countries <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: French newspapers today predicted that as a result of British and American naval cooperation, a defensive blockade will soon be implemented in the Pacific, from Alaska to the Australian waters, to prevent the Japanese fleet from attacking the Western Hemisphere. The French government is eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's speech on October 12. Speculation here is that in the speech, the US President may officially announce an agreement between Britain and the United States to establish a "sanitary zone" in the Pacific to force the Japanese fleet to remain in Asian waters. It is also believed here that the recent mobilization of US naval reservists is an indication of expanding naval activities in the near future. The "Times" reported yesterday, "If President Roosevelt's plan succeeds, a new defense line will be established to prevent various activities of the Japanese fleet and the sudden threat to Chilean ports by the Japanese navy." The newspaper also stated, "Once this plan is realized, a naval defense line starting from Hawaii and ending in Australia will extend across the Pacific, threatening British Far East bases. Recent meetings held in London and Washington have focused on discussions about the United States extending its naval defense to British New Zealand and Singapore." A famous French military expert, Duan Foe, wrote in "Daily News" yesterday, expressing doubts about Japan's ability to threaten the American continent should war break out between the US and Japan. He stated that if such a conflict occurs suddenly, naval and air battles would definitely take place in the China Sea and the Philippine Sea. He claimed that Europeans unanimously believe that a US-Japan war will eventually happen. The reason this war has not yet started is because Japan relies on economic exchanges with the Americas. However, if Japan obtains guarantees for trade with China, then Japan can adopt some methods to break away from its dependence on the United States. From a current political and military standpoint, Japan has no possibility of waging war on the American continent. Even if war breaks out, it can only take place near the Philippines. Although Japan has gradually established defensive obstacles in front of the Asian continent, it cannot cross the Pacific to the American continent due to its lack of bases. If the United States is not forced to abandon the Philippines during wartime, then the United States will surely win the first naval battle and establish hegemony in the Pacific." (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to political circles here, the recall of the US naval reserve, which occurred shortly after Navy Secretary Knox's announcement on Saturday that the US was prepared to fight if forced, shows the US authorities' determination to ignore Japan's empty threats. Japan's three years of war against China have left it mired in economic difficulties, which worsen month by month. Its pronouncements that the US's maintenance of the status quo in the Far East is plunging itself into crisis only provoke ridicule from those in US officialdom who know the truth. Japan is trying to create political difficulties for the United States, but the American public will not be easily intimidated, as Navy Secretary Knox has made clear. If Japan makes a suicidal attack on the US, then the US fleet is ready and waiting. The hope held by isolated factions that the US will not adopt a firm stance will ultimately prove to be a fatal illusion. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Washington "Star" editorial yesterday, "Give Japan a Lesson," again urged the US government to adopt a tough stance towards Japan. The newspaper stated that attempting to compromise with Japan would be a "dangerous folly." The newspaper said that the United States should immediately take "practical steps to curb the enormous ambitions of the Japanese government." These steps should include economic sanctions against Japan, active assistance to the Chinese government, and military understandings with Britain in the Far East. The newspaper also stated, "When Japan goes on to try to crush China and seize the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, it would be a great folly for the United States to stand idly by."

<p>US Holds Naval Conference Yesterday to Discuss Far East Issues Extensively</p>
<p>Washington: Diplomatic circles here are eager to learn the results of this morning's naval conference, as the decisions regarding the deployment of the US fleet, the joint US-British use of Singapore, and the US's maintenance of the status quo in the Far East may all need to be discussed. This morning, US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Richardson, Navy Secretary Knox, and other officials held a meeting. Due to the tension in the Far East, it is expected that Knox and Richardson have discussed extensive issues, such as the ability of the United States to maintain the status quo in the Far East and the issue of joint US-British use of Singapore and Australian bases. Furthermore, diplomatic circles speculate that other issues may also be under discussion, such as: (1) Whether the US fleet can be sent to bases in the Philippines and utilize them in emergencies; (2) Whether the US fleet can remain stationed in Hawaii indefinitely without affecting its effectiveness; (3) Whether the Asiatic Fleet can be expanded; (4) What is the relationship between the newly established Atlantic Patrol and the main fleet in the Pacific. Diplomatic circles said that the future of the entire US Far East policy will depend on this conference as a turning point. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles: Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Richardson flew to Washington today. This Pacific defense leader will meet with US President Roosevelt and Navy Secretary Knox to discuss matters closely. (International News Service, 7th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Daily News editorial today denounced as absurd the Japanese suggestion that the United States abandon its naval base at Pearl Harbor as a prelude to adjusting US-Japan relations. It stated that an Axis victory in Europe may prompt Japan and the Axis powers to attack the US. Therefore, the US should quickly strengthen its defenses in the Pacific, increasing its existing forces twofold. "Our main objective should be to pay close attention to the defense of our Pacific coast and sweep away any defensive ideas in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Indochina, or British India." (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Knox's Warning Agreed to by US Congressmen from Both Parties</p>
<p>Washington: Leading members of Congress stated last night that Navy Secretary Colonel Knox's speech on Saturday and the measure to order the recall of naval reservists were a kind of warning to Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo, and that the United States was prepared to accept any challenge from the Axis powers. It is said that Colonel Knox's speech has caught the attention of people around the world, that if the Axis powers take any further action, whether that action directly or indirectly threatens the security of the United States, then the United States will not hesitate to resist with force. The US Navy Secretary's speech has made it even more impossible for President Roosevelt's government to compromise for the sake of protecting US interests. Several prominent congressmen even believe that the United States may desperately need peace, but not at any cost to seek peace. Congressmen here also emphatically stated that US assistance to other democratic countries and China will not be suspended due to threats from the Tripartite Pact. Several senators speculated that Britain and the United States would unite with China to confront Japan. Senator Pepper, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, "Colonel Knox announced our country's position. What we need is peace, but we are not willing to be manipulated by others. Our assistance to democratic countries should be determined by ourselves and not stopped by orders from others. If Britain and the United States want to exchange bases anywhere in the Far East, we will act according to our own will and will not pay attention to the opinions of others." Another member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Green, said, "What Colonel Knox said truly represents the views of the American people and Congress." He also stated, "The speech should make the dictatorial regimes sit up and think. We are telling them that the American people do not want to adopt a policy of appeasement towards them anymore. We are telling them that we hope for peace, but we will never give up important rights to avoid war." Another senator on the committee, O'Mahoney, said, "The Navy Secretary's speech is a declaration of the United States' policy to move forward courageously." Senator Holt, an isolationist on the Senate Naval Committee and a long-time opponent of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, also stated that the United States does not want to adopt a policy of appeasement, but he acknowledged that Knox's remarks were a candid attempt to attack Germany, Italy, and Japan. He said, "I have long felt that we are bound to be drawn into the vortex of war, and this speech will bring us even closer to war." (United Press, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">US-Japan Relations Cannot Be Adjusted: Konoe and Matsuoka's Speeches Respond to Further Deterioration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: When a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Suma, met with reporters today, he was asked if there were any specific outlines in Tokyo or Washington that could serve as a basis for adjusting relations between the US and Japan. The spokesman replied that in the current situation, there is no room for adjusting relations between Japan and the United States, because the United States insists on first resolving the outstanding issues between the two countries. When asked whether Japan would regard the various actions taken by the United States to date, such as embargoes, as "a challenge to Japan," using the same term recently used by Prime Minister Konoe, the spokesman replied that discussing Prime Minister Konoe's reply would not be prudent. Prime Minister Konoe has exhausted his thoughts and studied the anti-Japanese embargoes and other actions taken by the United States, outside of his speech. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe today warned his people, urging them to prepare for potentially worse situations that may occur. Foreign Minister Matsuoka also delivered a speech. Both men spoke at the prefectural governors' conference. Konoe said, "The purpose of Japan's new alliance is to avoid the expansion of war and to accelerate the realization of peace. All my local officials should guide the people well and overcome the current difficult period together." However, Konoe did not make any specific remarks about the United States. Matsuoka claimed that Japan is prepared to share natural benefits with all countries in the world that do not interfere with Japan's intention to build a new chain of happiness in East Asia. The intention of Japan signing the Tripartite Pact is not to say that Japan will immediately participate in the European war, nor does it mean that all countries other than Germany and Italy are our enemies. As for Japan's invasion of China, if third countries wish to reduce losses in China, they should do their best to quickly seek a solution to this matter. Matsuoka said that there are four different perspectives in the China War: (1) Japan embraces the spirit of union and cooperation with China; (2) Chiang Kai-shek, based on anti-Japanese ideas, wants to balance Japan's power in East Asia; (3) Britain and the US originate from the ideal of maintaining the status quo; (4) The Soviet Union embraces the communist ideas of the workers' revolution.

<p>Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun today carried a moderate-toned article, stating that US Undersecretary of State Welles said at a meeting of the American Foreign Affairs Association in Cleveland on September 28 that there is no problem in the Far East that cannot be peacefully resolved through negotiation. The sentiment of these remarks is sufficient to govern the basic spirit of the negotiations between Japan and the United States to adjust relations. This sentiment can ensure that Japan respects American interests in China and reopens the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as the Japanese are indeed seeking to build diplomatic relations with the United States. American power holders have never paid attention to Japan's conciliatory suggestions. Now that one of them has suddenly made this remark, it is truly surprising. We are still prepared to forgive the past and ask President Roosevelt to reconsider his attitude towards Japan. The article also said that Prime Minister Konoe's remarks on Friday that the peace of the Pacific depends on the US attitude towards Japan are a serious warning to the US. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Britain, America, and Soviet Union Reach Tentative Understanding: If Japan Overthrows the Status Quo in the Pacific, It Will Face Economic Sanctions from the Three Countries <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Authoritative sources here said today that if Japan attempts to further overthrow the status quo in the Pacific, then the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union may immediately impose an economic blockade on Japan. Sources with considerable information claim that talks outside of Washington, London, and Moscow have produced a tentative understanding. However, they acknowledge that the Soviet Union's attitude is still somewhat unclear, but after the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union discussed matters with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last week, they both telegraphed their governments that the results were very good. It is believed that the terms of the British and American embargoes may have already been agreed upon, but Secretary of State Hull refused to comment on this news. It was indicated that the British and American governments may be waiting for clarification of the Soviet Union's attitude. Diplomats here said they believe that even if German pressure prevents the Soviet Union from joining the anti-Japanese front, the Soviet Union will maintain a bystander attitude for its own benefit and will not hinder the embargo against Japan. A US government official told reporters that in his personal opinion, the formation of an anti-Japanese front is now the key point of the US government's foreign policy. As for relations between Japan and the United States, it can be seen from the speeches of Konoe and Matsuoka, as well as the US Navy Secretary Knox's response, that they have further deteriorated. The mobilization of the US naval reserve also has the tendency to increase the state of tension between the two countries. It is believed here that President Roosevelt firmly believes that economic sanctions alone by the United States are not enough to change Japan's path, so cooperation with other countries is necessary. It has been pointed out here that if the United States begins to embargo high-octane aviation gasoline, Japan will immediately obtain it from British-Iranian oil companies in the Persian Gulf. It is said that the British-American oil companies in the Dutch East Indies are also selling oil to Japan. (International News Service, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japan's Policy Towards the US and the Soviet Union <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>After joining the German-Italian group and signing the Tripartite Pact, Japan has repeatedly made threatening remarks towards the United States and attempted to exchange recognition of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere for American recognition of the so-called "New Order in Greater East Asia," showing that it has not yet abandoned its lingering delusion. However, to say that the Japanese authorities still believe that there is room for the US policy to waver and that there are ways to salvage US-Japanese relations would be too delusional. At present, it is no longer making any efforts through diplomatic channels, but is only aiming at the eve of the US presidential election, spreading the terror of war to the United States in order to exploit isolationist elements, strengthen isolationist consciousness, and attack Roosevelt, hoping that the US president may be replaced and the successor may even change national policy. In fact, although the United States takes the Far East and its own security and interests as the subject of debate in the political struggle, there is no fundamental divergence in views and attitudes due to the opposition between the two parties, both in and out of office. Therefore, no matter what the result of the US election next month, Japan's hope in ten thousand will ultimately be disappointed. Not only that, but further decisions and actions by the United States, under normal circumstances, may be observed as waiting until after the presidential election is over. However, the tension and importance of various international situations have never been greater than they are now. The procedures for all political and diplomatic measures may not necessarily be as observed in general methods and may not wait until another day. Just look at the recent sudden recall of naval reserve soldiers to get a glimpse. The Japanese side can of course also see this, so it is making various attempts towards the United States, and what it is racking its brains to do is still to find ways to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union. Japan's repulsion of the United States, in addition to its positive role, also serves, in another sense, to show goodwill to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether there are any secret appendices to the Tripartite Pact outside the public provisions and what the content of the secret documents may be. Judging only from the surface of the public provisions, what the pact stipulates is only principles. Principles should be universally applicable, but the Soviet Union is an exception. Therefore, analyzing it from a formal perspective, assuming that any other country helps Britain fight against Germany and Italy, or helps China fight against Japan, then Germany, Italy, and Japan will help each other based on the pact; assuming that the Soviet Union helps Britain or China, then because the pact has a provision for the three countries to maintain relations with the Soviet Union, it can be interpreted as not applying the principle of mutual assistance under the pact to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This interpretation is permissible in a theoretical way. Whether it can actually be applied depends on the actions of the Soviet Union. How to interpret it, of course, is also one of the powers of a totalitarian country and does not necessarily need to be discussed in advance. However, the goodwill and fear of the three countries towards the Soviet Union are undeniable due to this provision in the pact. All three countries agree, and Japan is probably even more so. In Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's recent speech, he expressed his resentment towards the United States, but there was no need to be so particularly resentful in the pact's superficial principles. However, in the speech, he also specifically mentioned adjusting relations with the Soviet Union. Comparing the United States and the Soviet Union side by side cannot but be seen as using the United States as a foil, that is, to show particular goodwill to the Soviet Union. Originally, the Soviet Union also believed that it was not impossible to adjust relations with Japan, and its Foreign Commissar Molotov once said so publicly. If the authorities of the two countries expressed this way and Konoe also claimed that "the adjustment of relations with the Soviet Union in political and economic terms is now underway," it is known that there must be something brewing between them. The brewing may not be without results, but what Japan can gain is another question mark beyond the Tripartite Pact. Because the Soviet Union is a powerful country on the shores of the Pacific, and until now, it has not revealed its willingness to participate in the Pacific conflict. Furthermore, judging from its assistance to China in the past three years, the Soviet Union will never approve of Japan's arbitrary aggression in the East Asian continent. The space between these two boundaries is what the Soviet Union considers the place where "the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations is not impossible"! Japan's hope for the Soviet Union from the beginning was that the Soviet Union would tolerate Japan's aggression in the East Asian continent and stop Soviet aid to China. This is the main purpose of Japan's hope to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union in recent years. Even now, Japan has not necessarily abandoned this wish. Its ultimate disappointment goes without saying. Until Konoe took over as Prime Minister again and even after the conclusion of the recent Tripartite Pact, the US response made it clear that the US not only would not be deterred by the pact, but would become more active because of the stimulus of the pact. As a result, the content and purpose of Japan's expected adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations will undergo major changes. Simply put, Japan's relationship with the US is extremely difficult and dangerous, so it has to fear and show goodwill to the Soviet Union because of the Pacific storm. Therefore, Japan's so-called policy towards the Soviet Union in the past focused on China; the policy towards the Soviet Union in the future may focus on the US. We have a consistent understanding of the US-Japanese dispute, but we guess that the Soviet Union's views will not be entirely the same as ours. We believe that the Sino-Japanese War is a war of aggression and anti-aggression, while the conflict between the US and Japan is a conflict between democracy and totalitarianism, a conflict between civilization and happiness and military authority. In the Soviet Union, it completely agrees with the war of aggression and anti-aggression between China and Japan and has always sympathized with anti-aggression; as for the US-Japanese dispute, it may be regarded as a possible development into an equal war between imperialists, that is, the future Pacific storm will be regarded as the current European war. From this point of view, the current Japan may not hope to achieve a situation similar to that between the Soviet Union and Germany! What is different is that after the Soviet Union and Germany reconciled, Germany strengthened its determination to fight against Britain; if the Soviet Union and Japan reconciled, Japan would only strengthen its threatening attitude towards the US, because until now, no one can believe that Japan, in addition to threatening the US, hopes to scare the US away and has prepared for war against the US.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Britain Informs the Soviet Union That It Will Reopen the Burma Road: If Japan Attacks the Road, Britain Will See It as a Threat to Singapore <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm: According to the London correspondent of the "Svenska Dagbladet", well-informed British sources expect the Burma Road to be reopened on the 18th of this month. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has repeatedly visited the British Foreign Office to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and has contacted British Prime Minister Churchill to discuss the Burma Road issue. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has also repeatedly visited Downing Street. The British government has stated its intention to reopen the Burma Road to the Soviet Ambassador. The correspondent went on to say that British personnel have already stated that if Japanese aircraft bomb the Burma Road, Britain will regard it as a demonstration against Singapore. It is said that there are currently a large number of freight trucks and mules on the Sino-Burmese border, preparing to transport munitions. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that the Japanese government has not taken any steps regarding the Burma Road, which began to be blockaded on July 18th in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Agreement. As for whether the government will take any steps on it, it is also impossible to say. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka said today, after mentioning the new loans the US made to China, "Although we do not intend to provoke any country, we must make every effort to oppose any powerful country's assistance to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in order to prolong the Chinese war and delay the restoration of peace in East Asia. The Japanese government is now watching whether Britain will reopen the Burma Road, because this move can test Britain's attitude towards Japan after the Tripartite Pact. The Chinese incident is an inappropriate war, and it is difficult to avoid the impact on the interests of third countries, especially the interests used to resist our military actions. Matsuoka said that there are four different views in the Chinese war: (1) Japan embraces the spirit of uniting and cooperating with China; (2) Chairman Chiang, based on anti-Japanese concepts, wants to balance Japan's power in East Asia; (3) Britain and the US arise from the ideal of maintaining the status quo; (4) The Soviet Union embraces the communist righteousness of the workers' revolution. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: "Kokumin Shimbun" reported that, regarding the opening of the Burma Road, the attitudes of the Far Eastern countries and the intervention of Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly extreme. On the US side, President Roosevelt's election platform is based on assisting Britain, and there are other indications that the US is about to interfere in Far Eastern affairs. If this causes a conflict between the two countries in the Pacific, then the US should be responsible for it. As for the opening of the Burma Road and the US decision, Japanese troops are already in Vietnam, preparing to take action. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers here today again issued threats to Britain and the United States, saying that if the Burma Road is reopened this month, allowing the Chongqing government to transport various military supplies, then Japan will take "certain self-defense measures" against Britain and the United States. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: "Hochi Shimbun" published an editorial today, stating that if Britain does open the Burma Road, Japan will consider this action to be a breach of Britain's promise and a move that is unfriendly to Japan. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)</p>

<p>Sydney - The Australian government's naval construction order stipulates that 50 warships will be built by around the end of next year, so it is actively proceeding. All Australian shipyards are working overtime. Ten of these new ships are being built for the British Navy, and the rest are for the Australian Navy. All ships will be launched before the end of next year in preparation for deployment. The engineering of each ship is being undertaken by Australia, and the design of each ship is also being done by Australia. Australia's ability to start building such a large program of more than fifty patrol ships in a short period of time is the result of careful planning before the war. Before the war, Australia began building two destroyers and two troop transports, as well as several harbor defense ships. But after an investigation by naval authorities, it was decided what kind of large number of warships Australia could quickly build in case of emergency. The Navy Department then planned a type of ship that could be quickly built by Australian shipyards and have the value of sweeping mines, resisting submarines, and repelling aircraft. The British Navy Department was very pleased to see this and ordered twenty ships from Australia. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome - Reliable sources recently reported that nearly a division of German troops arrived in Romania a few days ago. Another 15,000 German troops are said to arrive within the next 24 hours. This decision by the German military is apparently to directly take over the Romanian oil fields to prevent interference from Italy. It is reported that the German troops that arrived have been stationed in the oil field areas between Ploiesti and the port of Constanta. (7th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Diplomatic circles here reported last night that Germany and Italy are preparing to immediately intensify military cooperation between the Axis powers and Romania. It is generally speculated that Romania will completely embrace the Axis powers. As proof of Romania's increased cooperation with the Axis powers, Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu was seen here yesterday wearing the green uniform of the Iron Guard, appearing before the public. Antonescu was formerly an opponent of the Iron Guard, but this time he changed his previous attitude, wearing the Iron Guard uniform and participating in the Iron Guard National Congress held in Bucharest. It is widely believed that the closer union between Romania and the Axis powers will be realized after the totalitarian Romanian government is completed. It is reported that within three or four days, Germany and Italy will express their support to the Antonescu government, which is controlled by the Iron Guard. Germany and Italy's support for Romania is widely believed to be a concrete expression of Germany and Italy's promise at the Vienna conference to defend Romania against external pressure. Reliable sources made a strong recommendation last night that German secret organizations, even regular German troops, should be established in Romania to help Romania form an army and police, and protect Romanian oil fields. After General Antonescu explained the goals of the Iron Guard at the meeting, he personally swore an oath to all Iron Guard members. Due to his actions, Romanian people said that General Antonescu actually wanted to become the supreme leader of the Iron Guard. The only foreign guests at this Iron Guard conference were the German, Italian, and Japanese ambassadors and military attachés. The flags of Germany, Italy, and Japan were hung in the meeting hall.

<p>London - The Air Ministry Information Office announced that on Saturday night, the British Air Force, in a lightning-fast operation, raided the Krupp armament factory in Essen, Germany, dropping two tons of high explosives from high altitude. Other targets included military objectives in Hamm, Osnabrück, and Cologne; ships in Rotterdam and Brest; a transport convoy in Gravelines; shipyards in Amsterdam and Flushing; and four airfields including Schiphol. Weather conditions in the British aircraft operating area were extremely poor. The bombers braved severe cold, low clouds, and intense thunderstorms and rain, carrying out the attacks. Most of the routes required blind flying. During the attack on Brest, large ships in the harbor and dry docks were damaged. One pilot reported that a bomb he dropped hit a road next to the pier and caused a series of explosions, apparently hitting an ammunition dump. British aircraft that reached the Ruhr area located oil factories in the Gelsenkirchen area, repeatedly bombing them for about half an hour. The factory area was hit, and there were successive explosions, with fires breaking out in several places, one of which spread rapidly. When British aircraft attacked Hamm, they dropped bombs on cargo, causing explosions and fires. In Osnabrück, near the railway siding, a bomb hit, causing a loud explosion and fire. During the attack on Rotterdam, large bombs hit and set fire to buildings along the dockyards and the north bank. British aircraft targeted the shipyard area on the south bank of the river in Amsterdam, hitting it with bombs and causing a large fire. During the attack on Flushing, large bombs hit the shipyard, causing continuous explosions for ten minutes and a large fire. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A detailed record of British Air Force bombings of German territory since the start of the war has recently been released for the first time. The number of enemy military targets heavily attacked by the British Air Force exceeds two hundred. The person who planned these British aircraft attacks has now been appointed to a new position, and will command an even larger British Air Force offensive. That person is Air Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the former commander of the Bomber Command, and the newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff. The British Air Force's bombings have mostly been carried out in German-occupied areas. According to the Information Office, the destruction of concentrated ships by British aircraft during attacks on German bases, has not only eliminated the threat of a German landing in England, but has also significantly impacted the use of German inland waterway transport. The destroyed ships were barges from the Rhine and other German inland rivers, on which Germany has traditionally relied to transport goods. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Air Force Uses Precision Methods to Bomb German Industrial Areas</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry revealed today that since the British Air Force adopted the scientific bombing method of "skilled planning," in more than seven hundred battles, large and small, it has rendered Hitler's industrial war machine crippled. It is claimed that within Germany itself, two hundred military targets have been bombed. British bombers have flown over Germany's important oil refining centers, ammunition factories, and railways, creating a destructive network. They scientifically coordinated their attack operations, and at strategically appropriate times, launched repeated attacks to hinder repair work. Almost all major towns in the Ruhr industrial area have been bombed. The British side also claimed that Germany's major seaports of Hamburg and Bremen have been reduced to ruins. The Air Ministry stated that the damage to enemy harbors and railways was so severe that not a single pound of military supplies was transported into Germany from Denmark in the past three weeks. The Information Office today released a map showing the eight areas in Germany that were bombed. Officials stated that each raid was carefully planned to gradually eliminate Hitler's war machine. However, the Information Office's report on the air raids did not include the bombing of airfields and ports in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. (7th International Electric)</p>

Millions of Londoners, although still taking refuge in air raid shelters, enjoyed their first uninterrupted sleep since September 7th. The silence of the air raids in London may have been due to the winds in the English Channel, but the people of London believe that it may be a sign of a major storm to come, as it is reported that Hitler is concentrating his forces for the invasion of England. The silence over London made the public feel rather apprehensive. (7th International Electric)</p>
<p>London - After one of the quietest nights since the start of the German aerial blitz, British and German aircraft engaged in fierce battles over England again today. Initial reports indicate that several enemy aircraft have been shot down by the British, including two bombers and one fighter. The center of the enemy aircraft attack was on the Kent coast. A large group of enemy bombers, protected by multiple Messerschmitt aircraft, flew over the area and were only dispersed by intercepting British fighter aircraft. There were several daytime air raids in the London area, during one of which several locations were bombed by enemy aircraft, causing slight property damage and minor casualties. On one occasion, more than a dozen enemy aircraft in two groups infiltrated the skies over southeast London, dropped several bombs, and then quickly retreated. Yesterday evening, a single enemy aircraft dropped bombs on the outskirts of London, causing very little damage and no casualties. In addition, a German aircraft flew over the south coast and dropped several bombs in several places. Apart from the above, there were no other activities over England last night.

<p>London - The crew of the British ship "Hauxley" (5207 tons) landed at a port in Scotland on Saturday after being sunk. According to the crew, there is a German raiding ship in the Atlantic Ocean that uses an extendable smokestack to change its appearance and frequently repaints its hull and changes the flags it flies to conceal itself as a German ship. It was found that the "Hauxley" was sunk on April 14th. The captain and twenty-three crew members were transferred by the German raiding ship to a Norwegian merchant ship, and then transferred by a British submarine to Gibraltar. According to the crew's report, the German raiding ship initially issued an order to stop, but the British ship did not comply. The German ship then opened fire, killing a gunner and damaging the deck structures and lifeboats. As the hull sank, the German ship launched a small boat to rescue the crew and place them on board, detaining them for two months. The German ship later captured a Norwegian merchant ship and transferred the crew to it. This Norwegian ship drifted for another two months, heading towards Germany, but was eventually intercepted by a British submarine. The enemy raiding ship's food consisted of black bread, sweet potatoes, coffee, and a small amount of butter. Eating this for a long time affected their health. The crew did not fully worship Hitler. One medic openly called Hitler crazy, and said that many Germans did not want to fight. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Spy Hysteria in Europe and America <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>There are also signs of collaboration with the enemy among British fascists, and many spies are also communists. Under instructions from Moscow, they incite unrest in armaments factories and spread the theory that this war is nothing more than an imperialist conflict.</p>
<p>Fascist elements specialize in obtaining intelligence from British upper-class society. In terms of social status, they can operate in upper-class society, which is not the case for communists. According to statistics from the beginning of this year, there are 60,000 enemy aliens residing in Britain, and less than 1,000 have been imprisoned. This lenient British approach may have gone on for too long in a war of survival. As a result, many dangerous spies have slipped through the net. Britain has also taken in thousands of refugees, mostly educated Czechs and Poles, who are sometimes bought off due to their poverty.</p>
<p>As of now, there are still 20,000 German aliens residing in Britain, and together with British fascists and communists, they can form a powerful plainclothes force. The first strict measure taken by Britain against plainclothes forces was to detain thousands of enemy men residing on the eastern and southern coasts. Nationals of neutral or friendly countries in the aforementioned areas should also report to the police station every day and are not allowed to travel by car or bicycle. They should stay at home after 8 PM every night and before 6 AM in the morning and should not go out. War Secretary Eden has also formed civil defense groups to patrol various areas. The main purpose is to prevent paratroopers and plainclothes forces from colluding.</p>
<p>At the end of May, Britain also imprisoned 4,000 enemy aliens from various places.</p>
<p>At the same time, a law was passed to punish traitors, stipulating that offenses such as conspiracy, sabotage, obstructing military affairs, spying on military information, and aiding the enemy internally would be punishable by death. Small-scale searches of domestic fascists and communists are underway. Originally, less than 200 women were imprisoned, but after the German occupation of the Netherlands, many female spies were found to be collaborating on the island, so Britain also paid attention to this danger. Several women have been imprisoned. British fascist leaders Oswald Mosley and his wife have also been imprisoned.</p>
<p>J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI</p>
<p>is also very serious. Although all three political parties in Ireland have united to prevent treasonous activities, the Germans at the German embassy in Dublin have had the opportunity to contact the Irish Republican Army. In an extreme situation, British troops may have to occupy major Irish seaports for security.</p>
<p>Is there also spy hysteria in the United States? According to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, there is. Even if the United States has only one spy, he can still harm the United States. Even if he obtains one state secret, it is enough to endanger the safety of countless American citizens. Napoleon's spy agency was led by only one person, but that person's network of contacts was naturally very large. All espionage activities are similar in nature. This has been the case throughout history, and the modern situation is no exception.</p>
<p>Some people in the United States outwardly maintain a calm demeanor, saying that discussing spy terror is boring. However, if there is no espionage activity in the United States, how were secret aircraft blueprints stolen? How did a treasonous naval officer betray naval secrets? Since September 1939, the FBI has received many reports of espionage and sabotage.</p>
<p>In the five years before 1938, the FBI had to resolve an average of thirty-five cases of espionage, sabotage, and leakage of national defense secrets each year. By 1938, the number of such cases had reached no less than two hundred and fifty, and in 1939, it jumped to one thousand six hundred and fifty-one. There are more now. This is naturally not a reassuring situation.</p>
<p>Spies and sabotage are related. When conspiracies occur, sabotage will also occur. The scope of espionage has expanded and is no longer limited to military secrets. Spies have infiltrated all aspects of American commerce, industry, and society. The situation with sabotage is also the same. According to an FBI investigation, the United States has these foreign conspirators who are willing to harm the United States to repay America's preferential treatment. The recent unauthorized sale of hundreds of feet of film to foreign countries can only be seen as espionage activity. This type of film shows the locations of American air bases. If other countries obtain this film, they can accurately hit their desired targets from the air by following the map. These films, when discovered, were certainly a threat to American security. This is just one example. There are many other espionage activities in the United States that concern national defense secrets and cannot be discussed publicly. Spy agencies are making every effort to explore the progress of American national defense plans. President Roosevelt appealed to local authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the United States on September 6th last year to cooperate and strictly prevent espionage, sabotage, and other activities. At that time, he ordered the FBI to investigate these incidents and ordered the addition of 150 special agents, earmarking funds to increase work efficiency.</p>
<p>At the time of the last World War, the United States had extremely poor intelligence agencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was just in its infancy. The current situation has changed. The Army and Navy intelligence departments are well organized and highly efficient. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also fully matured.</p>
<p>To cope with the current situation, the FBI has stationed detectives in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii to closely monitor the US defense outposts.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also established agencies in six new cities in the United States so that militarily important strongholds can benefit from increased security with the assistance of additional special agents.</p>
<p>In the early summer of last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation established a department to teach specialized knowledge of investigating espionage and sabotage. In addition, the US Army and Navy ordered the FBI to protect thousands of factories that have contracts with the government to rush production of military equipment.</p>
<p>In short, Americans still remember the lessons of the last World War and are currently on high alert. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e47">British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Noble, Arrives in Shanghai. Rumor Has It He Will Meet with Hart to Discuss the Situation in the Far East. American Military and Political Officers Held a Meeting Yesterday. American Naval Reservists in Shanghai Stand Ready to Depart. <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Following the news that the British and American navies will jointly blockade the Japanese navy in the Pacific, morale has greatly increased in Shanghai. After the establishment of the Axis powers among Germany, Italy, and Japan, the joint action of Britain and the United States to respond to aggressors in the Far East will undoubtedly create a favorable situation for China's war of resistance. Furthermore, the sudden arrival in Shanghai of Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, to confer with Admiral Hart of the United States, is also cause for celebration. A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned yesterday from well-informed sources in foreign diplomatic circles that Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, arrived suddenly in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday morning, Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, also held an important joint meeting of military and political officers. Some authoritative figures in Shanghai believe that Admiral Noble's arrival in Shanghai is related to a meeting with Hart to discuss close cooperation between the British and American fleets in the Far East. However, this claim has not yet been confirmed by the authorities of both countries, as both British and American officials are maintaining strict silence on the matter.</p>
<p>American Officers Held Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>It is reported that at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. Garrison in Shanghai, arrived at the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road one after another and held an important meeting with U.S. Consul General Butrick and other senior military and political officers. Colonel Baker left first at approximately 11:00 AM, followed by Admiral Hart and Rear Admiral Glassford at 11:30 AM. Although the contents of the meeting are unknown, it is widely believed that they discussed the future development of the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>British Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, recently relinquished his post. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with relevant parties, Admiral Noble departed from Hong Kong a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai the night before last. When inquiring with British officials in Shanghai yesterday, they confirmed that Admiral Noble was passing through Shanghai on his way back to London, England. However, according to sources who first informed Pingming News Agency about Admiral Noble's arrival, it is believed that Noble is in Shanghai to meet with Admiral Hart to discuss cooperation between the British and American fleets in the Far East. Therefore, it is feared that Noble will also contact U.S. naval authorities during his trip to the United States via Shanghai before returning to England. However, the aforementioned reports have not yet been confirmed by British and American officials stationed in Shanghai. Nevertheless, the significance of Noble's arrival in Shanghai is widely believed to be significant by all parties.</p>
<p>American Reservists Stand Ready to Depart</p>
<p>The English-language newspaper *The China Press* reports that after Washington issued a mobilization order yesterday (the 6th) calling for naval reservists to join the U.S. fleet, approximately fifty U.S. naval reservists in Shanghai are awaiting orders to depart today (the 7th). Some of them said this morning that they expect to receive firm orders tomorrow (the 8th). It is reported that these naval reservists will not necessarily join the U.S. Navy's Yangtze River Patrol. It is widely believed that a small number of reservists may soon be transferred to the USS *Augusta* for immediate service, while the remaining reservists are expected to receive orders to return to the United States, or they may not board ships for service at sea, but instead perform heavy work on shore. It is reported that among the fifty naval reservists currently stationed in Shanghai who are members of the American community, two are ill and hospitalized in critical condition. Most of the remaining forty or so have been residing in Shanghai for many years, and many of them own or work as waiters in cafes and bars on Zhubao Road and other locations.</p>
<p>Arousing Exceptional Concern in Shanghai</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the announcement by the U.S. Navy Department yesterday (the 6th) to mobilize all reservists of the "L" formed fleet and Marine Corps has aroused exceptional concern in Shanghai. It is estimated that there are approximately one hundred U.S. fleet reservists residing in Shanghai, some of whom have been living in Shanghai for many years and engaged in commerce. Whether these individuals will comply with Washington's orders and enlist is still unclear by the official announcement, causing much speculation.</p>
<p>Mobilization Order Expected</p>
<p>However, yesterday's telegram from Washington stated that the Navy Department had already mobilized all naval reservists, except for volunteer reservists. Therefore, it is expected that the U.S. Navy Department's order will also apply to U.S. Navy reservists residing in the Far East. According to sources in the U.S. Fleet Reserve in Shanghai, they believe that the issuance of the mobilization order was not unexpected, as the annual physical examinations for naval reservists, which were aimed at classifying reservists by grade, were carried out with unusual strictness this year, and there had already been rumors in Shanghai about the U.S. Navy's intention to call up reservists.</p>
<p>Officials Have No Opinion on This</p>
<p>Furthermore, *The Shanghai Times* reports that regarding the U.S. Navy's call-up of reservists, reporters inquired with a member of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet and conducted investigations. However, the impact of this order from the U.S. Navy Department on U.S. Navy reservists residing in Shanghai or other parts of the Far East remains uncertain. U.S. officials have no firm opinion on this matter. They claim that they have no information other than the telegrams already received here.</p>
<p>Retired Officers and Soldiers Will Also Be Conscripted</p>
<p>It is known that there are quite a few retired officers and soldiers from the U.S. Navy living in Shanghai who receive pensions. It is widely believed that some of them may be called up for service. U.S. naval officers declined to comment on this point. However, it is generally believed that most of these retired naval officers are over the age of military service. Therefore, if the U.S. Navy Department's current call-up of reservists is implemented in Shanghai, the number of retired officers and soldiers who are called up for service will be small. As for the number of American expatriates in Shanghai who belong to other grades of the Naval Reserve who will be called up for service, it is also impossible to know for certain. According to non-official sources, their number will also be quite limited.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Celebrating the Double Tenth Festival, Promoting Four Major Campaigns: Thrift and Disaster Relief, Raising Funds for Winter Clothing, Implementing National Construction Savings, and National Day Donations <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The day after tomorrow is the National Day of the Republic of China. All sectors of the community in Shanghai, all levels of courts, post offices, customs, and various agencies and organizations will hang flags and take a holiday. They will also actively promote four major campaigns: (1) Thrift and disaster relief, (2) Raising funds for winter clothing, (3) National construction savings, and (4) National Day donations. The authorities of the two settlements have decided to jointly implement security measures starting today. In addition to prohibiting illegal gatherings and activities, they will strictly enforce curfew laws, and unnecessary roads will also be closed early (such as Laobeimen Street and Beile Road in the French Concession, which have been closed to traffic since the evening of the day before yesterday before 8:00 PM and will not be reopened until 8:00 AM the next morning). The number of police officers stationed on various roads has also been increased, and search operations have been stepped up. On the one hand, car patrol teams and patrol teams have been dispatched to various districts to conduct searches of pedestrians and vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Thrift and National Construction Savings: Forming a Promotion Committee <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Savings bonds originated in England. When the previous European war broke out, British economists suggested compulsory savings. However, during that war, the implementation of wartime savings bonds in England was extremely effective. As for compulsory savings, if based on salary grades, disparities between the rich and poor would make fairness difficult to achieve. Therefore, it was not implemented. China's industry has not yet developed to its full extent, and salary standards are narrow in scope. To achieve the popularity of savings, the effect of promoting savings is crucial. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, have jointly formed the National Thrift and National Construction Savings Promotion Committee to promote thrift savings on a more widespread scale and to be responsible for intensifying promotions. For thrift savings, in addition to the government guaranteeing the safety of principal and interest, they are also specially authorized to exempt income tax on savings interest in order to encourage the people to actively save.</p>
<h3 id="e50">A Soldier from the Lost Battalion Was Shot Yesterday by a White Russian. Xie Jinyuan Made a Statement Last Night, Bearing Humiliation and Heavy Burdens in Accordance with the Wishes of Chairman Chiang, and that The Soldier Was Shot Unprovoked, and Pedestrians Were Hit by Stray Bullets. <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Lost Battalion on Jiaozhou Road had a conflict with the White Russian merchant guard last month. After several negotiations by He Dequi, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Guo Shun, a satisfactory resolution was reached, and peace had been maintained for more than ten days. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, another incident occurred in which a White Russian guard shot a soldier from the Lost Battalion. A reporter from Dazhong News Agency visited Commander Xie Jinyuan last night, who made a statement. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Looking Out and Shot Without Reason</p>
<p>At 10:05 AM yesterday, a soldier from the Lost Battalion poked his head out to look over the northwest corner of the compound wall (on Singapore Road). He was spotted by a White Russian guard, who immediately fired a shot at him. The bullet hit him in the left neck, and he collapsed under the wall. A man and an old woman were also hit by stray bullets. After the incident, the police and Renji Hospital were notified by telephone, and ambulances were dispatched to take the wounded to the hospital for treatment. The Gordon Road Police Station also dispatched detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. It is reported that the soldier's name is Ding Guoshun (Sergeant), 29 years old, from Hubei Province. His injuries are not serious and his life is not in danger. The bullet grazed Ding's neck, pierced a man's flank, and entered the old woman's leg. The bullet has not yet been removed. After the incident, the camp maintained its original order and did not cause any disturbance. Security was as usual.</p>
<p>Xie Jinyuan Made a Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM last night, a reporter from Dazhong News Agency paid a special visit to Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lost Battalion. According to him, "It is impossible to know what the soldier was trying to do when he poked his head over the wall. According to my speculation, it may be due to the extreme mental suffering he has endured for the past three years. However, it must be solemnly stated that the soldier's actions were purely personal and had nothing to do with the will of the entire Lost Battalion. However, it can be asserted that this action was by no means a capital crime. The White Russian guard's rash shooting, according to the laws of civilized countries, seems to be excessive and regrettable. At a time when the international environment is favorable to China, we, being in a complex situation, will not take any unnecessary actions that may cause any disturbance, nor will we take any humiliating actions that are contrary to the position of Chinese soldiers. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram yesterday instructing me to bear humiliation and heavy burdens in the face of any incident. I will strictly abide by this instruction and carefully deal with everything." Xie said that this incident would not escalate. At this time, the enthusiastic national anthem was sung on the parade ground. Xie and his subordinates stood up to salute, and the reporter also left.</p>
<h3 id="e51">National Rice Prices Fall, Breaking the 90 Yuan Barrier Yesterday. Low-Priced Rice Sales to End Today <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The overall problem of public food is gradually easing these days. Rice prices at various stores are falling, the market is full of spot goods, and public sentiment is finally weakening. Yesterday morning, rice prices at various stores continued to fall, and national rice prices broke the 90 yuan barrier.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the source of foreign rice from abroad, few shipments have arrived in Shanghai recently. However, 80,000 bags of Kong rice have been continuously loaded onto French ships and have begun their journey. They are still on their way to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month. All of these shipments were traded some time ago, and the price of each bag is only about 75 or 76 yuan. Once this batch of foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, the market price of rice is expected to plummet. As for foreign rice from Hong Kong, it can also be shipped in batches in a short period of time. Therefore, the food reserves in Shanghai will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Association Orders 6,000 Bags</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association, located at Room 311, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, accepts entrustments from all walks of life to order foreign rice and enrich Shanghai's food reserves. At a time when rice prices are soaring, the Association's work is even more relevant. It is heard that the Association's purchasing committee, headed by Gui Yanfang, entrusted Shen Ji &amp; Co. on the 25th of this month to order 4,000 bags of Grade 2 Kong rice and another 2,000 bags. Each bag weighs 220 pounds, equivalent to 1 stone and 2 dou and a half, at a price of 79.5 yuan and 80 yuan in legal currency. They will be distributed to the 22nd and 23rd batches of subscribers. The 24th batch has gathered a considerable number of subscribers and will continue to be ordered.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Rice Sales End Today</p>
<p>The sixth phase of low-priced foreign rice sales organized by the Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee began on the 19th of last month, and the poor have been very enthusiastic about purchasing it. Sales at 24 rice shops in the French Concession area were temporarily suspended at the end of last month due to the inability to distribute rice because of the police's protection of streetcar traffic. They have not yet resumed. It is learned that, according to regulations, each phase lasts 20 days, which ends today. Sales will be temporarily terminated starting from the 9th. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency who inquired with the Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee, the Committee has organized six phases of low-priced rice sales, totaling 170,000 bags of foreign rice. As of now, there are still more than 30,000 bags of broken rice left. A meeting will be held to discuss continuing sales until this batch of rice is sold out, and then sales will be terminated.</p>
<p>Fellow Villagers' Group Buys Rice</p>
<p>Daguang News Agency reports that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association's executive committee, Yan Bo, believes that high rice prices affect the livelihood of the common people and social order. He has sent a letter requesting the Association to organize a fellow villagers' group to purchase rice. The proposed measures are as follows: (1) Organize a special committee for group rice purchases, (2) Stipulate the number of bags purchased in each batch, (3) Use radio stations to broadcast the purpose and detailed measures of the group rice purchase and advertise in newspapers to solicit purchasers, (4) Stipulate the unit of purchase for purchasers (with 5 bags as the unit of purchase) and the deposit to be paid, and (5) Designate a bank to receive deposits.</p>

To Sail to Saigon and Haiphong After Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The French Mail Steamship Company's regular mail ship on the Europe-Asia line, *Général Joffre*, and several irregular ships, such as *Yarra*, *Seikiang*, *Kaiteria*, and *Lothian*, suspended their voyages to the Far East due to the expansion of the European war. The *Général Joffre* was docked in Saigon, and the *Yarra* and *Seikiang* irregular ships were rerouted to the Shanghai-Vietnam line. After the Japanese army landed in Haiphong on the 26th of last month, all ships on the Hong Kong-Vietnam and Shanghai-Vietnam lines were suspended. Therefore, the *Yarra*, *Seikiang*, and other French ships also suspended their voyages to Saigon for more than ten days. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, French ships will soon resume the Shanghai-Vietnam line. The French Mail Steamship Company's *Yarra*, *Lothian*, and *Kaiteria* will depart from Saigon within the next few days to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is expected that the *Yarra* will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th of this month, and the *Lothian* will also arrive in Shanghai on the 17th. The *Kaiteria* will also arrive around the 20th. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they will sail to Saigon and Haiphong on a regular basis. It is also heard that the *Yarra* and *Lothian* are transporting large quantities of foreign rice from Vietnam, as many as 80,000 bags. It is also known that although the Japanese army has entered Vietnam, commerce cannot be interfered with. Therefore, the transport of Vietnamese rice to China is not affected.</p>

<p>Striking workers of the French Tramway Company reportedly presented seven demands to the company's General Manager, Favre, in writing yesterday morning. It is said that Favre received the demands and also responded in writing in the afternoon. The conditions negotiated by both parties are as follows:</p>

(4) Wages must be increased. (5) Workers must not be dismissed without reason. (6) Temporary workers hired during the strike must be dismissed. (7) Suspended workers must be reinstated.</p>
<p>Capital Response</p>
<p>(1) The company will never recognize representatives who do not have the legal number of members. (2) The company will pay wages as usual and also temporary subsidies from the start of the strike on the 25th of last month to the date of request, the 7th of this month. However, the foreman's bonus will be canceled, and striking workers who have not come to work by the 8th will be treated as resigned. (3) The company agrees that the employed workers will continue working after the police releases those who are deemed innocent. (4) The company will not respond to the wage increase issue, as the wages of all workers in this company are comparable to those of other companies. (5) The company agrees to this and will never dismiss workers without reason. (6) If the striking workers return to work, all temporary workers hired by the company will be dismissed. This will never happen. (7) The company believes that if a suspended worker has made a mistake, they will not be reinstated. If a suspended worker requests reinstatement, they should submit a written request to the company, which will then consider the matter and make a decision. Based on this, the negotiations have shown a glimmer of hope and may be resolved in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Interbank Transfers of 50 Million Yuan: Allocations Soon to Be Exhausted. Widely Used in Shanghai for More Than a Year <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>In order to adjust the supply of funds for industry and commerce among colleagues in the banking industry, the Bankers Association of Shanghai began handling interbank allocation on July 1, 1939. Since then, various banks and firms have applied to the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee for allocations in accordance with regulations, which have become widely circulated in the Shanghai market and have been well received by Chinese and foreigners alike. The original total allocation amount was 50 million yuan in national currency, which is soon to be exhausted. To avoid misunderstandings regarding the issuance of allocation certificates, it has been decided to</p>
<p>Keep Them in Reserve But Not Use Them</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the Bank Preparatory Committee yesterday about the status of allocations. From July 1939 to June 1940: (1) The total amount of interbank allocation approved was 29,365,000 yuan. (2) The amount already allocated to various banks and firms was 17,340,000 yuan. (3) The collateral deposited by various banks and firms: A. Goods: 2,546,000 yuan, percentage: 5.34, B. Marketable securities: 8,693,000 yuan, percentage: 18.22, C.</p>
<p>Real Estate</p>
<p>16,463,000 yuan, percentage: 76.44. The above are the average numbers for 12 months. As for July, the total amount of approved allocation was 38,495,000 yuan, and the amount already allocated to various banks and firms was 23,922,000 yuan. In August, the total amount of approved allocation was 38,103,000 yuan, and the amount already allocated to various banks and firms was 24,431,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to the recent interruption of shipping to Shipu, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association intended to stop issuing certificates for fellow villagers returning to their hometown. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, in order to facilitate the return of fellow villagers, the Association is still issuing certificates to members of the Association or fellow villagers with legitimate occupations who must return to their hometown for business purposes, so that they can travel back and forth. At the same time, the Yinxian County Government's office for issuing travel permits has also officially resumed operations and is issuing travel permits as usual. Anyone holding a certificate issued by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association can exchange it for a travel permit before being allowed to leave for Shanghai.</p>

Residents Stay Indoors and Experience False Alarms <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since the shooting of Japanese Army trainee officer Yoshio Imai at 9:50 AM the day before yesterday in front of Xujiahui Catholic Church, the Japanese army has mobilized. In addition to maintaining strict security at the scene of the incident, they have also searched every house, but to no avail. It is learned that the Japanese soldier was patrolling the area on a bicycle in plain clothes when he was suddenly attacked. He was hit in the chest and abdomen and collapsed to the ground in pain. He lost consciousness and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the situation in Xujiahui and the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai suddenly became tense. Large groups of Japanese military police patrolled and searched pedestrians at any time. In general, residents stayed indoors and experienced false alarms.</p>

<p>At around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, patrolmen No. 083 and No. 1371 from the General Patrol Force were patrolling along Yuanmingyuan Road when they saw six or seven coolies pulling a tiger car loaded with 37 bolts of woolen cloth worth tens of thousands of yuan. Because the circumstances were suspicious, they stepped forward to investigate. Unexpectedly, these people tried to escape. Because the patrolmen were outnumbered, No. 1371 had no choice but to fire two warning shots. One bullet hit another passerby, Peng Qisheng, in the arm. As a result, Mao Rengen, Wang Youcai, and Wang Ruxi were arrested and brought back to the police station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Peng Bingsheng, it was learned that the woolen cloth was stolen from the office of Russian merchant Kao Qidaofu (transliteration), located at No. 97 Yuanmingyuan Road. They planned to sell it to woolen cloth brokers Zhu Guoliang, who resided in Room 315 of the Yangtze Hotel. Detectives went to the room and arrested Zhu Guoliang, as well as Yuan Lide, Zhou Shengrong, Xiang Jin, Zhou Mingyang, and others who lived in the same room. They were transferred to the Criminal Court One of the Special Court One yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested that the hearing be postponed because the case still required the arrest of accomplices and investigation of the case. After questioning by Judge Feng, he ordered them to be held for a further hearing.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1 PM, another kidnapping case occurred in the Public Concession. The kidnapped victim was Xu Busun, a gold shop owner from Suzhou. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening a Gold Shop</p>
<p>Xu Busun, from Wu County, is 60 years old and resides at No. 5 and 7, Lane 106, Maitehesi Road in Shanghai. He owns Tongfengyong Gold Shop at No. 310 Nanjing Road. He has one wife and one concubine. Although Xu is already elderly, he still goes to the shop to work every day, so he owns a No. 1560 car for transportation, and employs Chen Shunfa as the driver.</p>
<p>Encountering Bandits En Route</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1 PM, Xu ordered the driver to bring the car out and boarded it to go to work. He was traveling west to east. When he reached Muer Ming Road, four bandits suddenly appeared. Three of them, armed with pistols, blocked the car's path. They jumped into the car, threatened him with guns, forced the driver Chen Shunfa out, and drove the car south to an unknown location.</p>
<p>Pursuit Without Results</p>
<p>After the incident, the driver Chen Shunfa rushed home to inform Xu's family, who reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Upon receiving the information, the police dispatched police cars full of Chinese and foreign detectives to track down and arrest the bandits. However, the bandits, the car, and the people were all gone. The police notified all district police stations and the French Concession police to pay close attention to the car, but so far there is still no trace of the people or the car.</p>

<p>Huang Jinbiao, a poor man from Jiangbei, 37 years old, lives by scavenging garbage in an empty house at No. 44, Xieqiao Road, Nanshi. Yesterday morning around 10 AM, he picked up a pile of pufferfish roe in a garbage bin at the Jumen Road intersection. He took it home, cooked it, and ate it with his meal. Unexpectedly, after eating it, he suffered severe abdominal pain and was barely breathing. He was taken to the hospital by someone for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 6 AM, three thieves suddenly came to Zhenda Xiang Cloth Shop at No. 1225, Haige Road, Xujiahui in the French Concession.

<h3 id="e66">Compound Organ Preparation: Ginseng Velvet Spermin - Developed by Pharmacist He Zikang <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Since the German physiologist Browu Sequard extracted testicular hormone and named it Spermin, endocrine preparations have been applied in the treatment field. Afterwards, the number of researchers increased day by day. In the past fifty years, other endocrine hormones have been invented continuously, and the most effective is testicular hormone, that is, Spermin. But we cannot ignore the fact that we praise Spermin, but put other hormones related to development, reproduction and maintenance of health behind our minds, such as the pituitary gland's control of development, ovarian follicles' relationship with menstruation and female development, and deer antler's nourishment of the human body. Each has its own effect, but various endocrine hormones are also interrelated. Only by shortening the length and supplementing the weaknesses can great effects be shown. Therefore, modern drug manufacturers often make medicines with multiple hormones to treat diseases. However, multiple components, such as the crystalline hormone of testicles, deer antler, etc., are very difficult to refine. If the immersion cream preparation method is used, the efficacy will be weak. Therefore, it is difficult for those without extensive experience to be effective, especially for compound organ preparations. It is necessary to ensure that each component does not lose its inherent efficacy. Mr. He Zikang, a Chinese pharmaceutical expert, is the earliest Chinese researcher of organ preparations. Mr. He has been researching endocrine preparations for more than ten years and has already made products for the benefit of society. Now, based on his experience, based on the theory of endocrinology, he has further developed compound wax organ preparations. The ingredients are extracted from ginseng, deer antler, testicles, placenta, ovarian follicles, and liver to refine effective crystalline bodies, and added vitamins B and D. It is named "Ginseng Velvet Spermin" Sunmoon Spermin, which is divided into injection and tablet forms. It is the most perfect of modern compound organ preparations. He's self-created Jixing Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory has perfect scientific equipment and is exquisite and superior. It is said that the medical and pharmaceutical circles in this port admire the factory's products. The efficacy and curative effect of "Ginseng Velvet Spermin" will definitely surpass all therapeutic drugs.</p>

<p>Xi Meimei, a woman from Suzhou, 24 years old, runs her business in a brothel at No. 3, Fuyu Lane, Guangxi Road. In 1937, Zhang Zuwang, a local manager of the Heyuan Sugar Shop at No. 19, Fujian Road, invited guests to the brothel. Seeing that Xi Meimei's appearance was not bad, he falsely claimed that his wife had passed away and proposed to</p>
<p>marry her.</p>
<p>Xi was temporarily lured by sweet words and rented a house with him to cohabit. It has been four years since then, and the two have been happy. On January 25 of this year, Meimei gave birth to a daughter named Bao Bao at Guangren Hospital on Avenue Edward VII. Now she is pregnant again. However, the course of love is full of changes. In the barren months of this year, a person surnamed Li suddenly came to Xi's place and said, "Your affair with Zhang Zuwang has been discovered by his wife. Quickly break up with Mr. Zhang, otherwise I am afraid it will be unfavorable to you. Money can be discussed." Xi at that time</p>
<p>was skeptical.</p>
<p>At that time, Zhang had not come to her place for several days. At first, she thought Zhang was busy with business, so she did not suspect anything else. Now that Li had stated the situation, she began to investigate. Soon, she met Zhang's wife at Heyuan Sugar Shop. Her attitude was fierce and unreasonable. Xi asked to see Zhang one last time, but it was impossible. She realized that Zhang already had the intention of abandoning her and she could not reverse it. Repeated negotiations on settlement arrangements also yielded no results. Xi Meimei then hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to represent her and submitted a petition to the Civil Court of the Special Court, in the capacity of a legal representative, on behalf of her daughter Bao Bao against Zhang Zuwang, seeking</p>
<p>confirmation of the birth of a daughter</p>
<p>and payment of 1,500 yuan for five months of living expenses. Based on the petition, the court was heard yesterday morning in the seventh civil court by Judge Tan Hao. First, the plaintiff stated the intention of the lawsuit, and said that the defendant had assets of hundreds of thousands of yuan and had sugar shops all over Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu, so it was a drop in the ocean for him to bear a monthly living expense of 300 yuan. The defendant was absent, and lawyers Yu Bingwen and Li Baosen appeared in court as agents. They believed that Bao Bao was born to the defendant, and</p>
<p>requested that the lawsuit be rejected.</p>
<p>At this point, the plaintiff presented second landlord Mi Luqing, maid Qian Xiashi, and wet nurse Chuan Zhangshi to testify in court, stating that the house at No. 3, Fuyu Lane was rented by Zhang, and the wages of the maid and others were paid by Zhang. The court verified the words, because Zhang himself and the nurses of Guangren Hospital needed to be summoned to testify, so the hearing was postponed to the 14th for further hearing.</p>

After paying respects to the provincial government authorities on the 16th, they visited various cultural institutions and academic groups. After a stay of about ten days, they left Guilin and planned to go deep into various special ethnic areas for inspection. In addition, the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Sericulture Department of the School of Agriculture of National Sun Yat-sen University once demarcated several acres of land near Longzhou to establish a sericulture farm to engage in silkworm silk improvement and development work.

Recently, both parties re-negotiated the investigation and decided to demarcate some acres near Gongcheng and Guilin to continue the field experiment. After the main project of the Sericulture Department of Zhongda, Dr. Yang Bangjie, formulates the plan and submits it to the Guangxi Provincial Government for approval, preparations for its establishment will be started.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Children's Welfare Association Launches a Charity Painting Auction; Sends Letters Soliciting Famous Works; For Tuition Fees for Newspaper Boys, Etc. <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is a purely charitable organization dedicated to children's welfare. It has carried out relief work for many years and has won the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life. Recently, the association has been painstakingly planning and diligently executing the project of education for newspaper boys and care for beggar children, which is truly admirable. It is reported that the painting exhibition committee of the association, along with Ya Chen, Li Qiujun, Ma Gongyu, Xie Haiyan, Xie Gongzhan, Yan Wenliang, etc., have launched a project to solicit 1,000 paintings and calligraphy works from all walks of life for a charity sale. All proceeds will be used for the association's expenses. The association needs more than 1,000 yuan per month for expenses, which used to come from donations from all walks of life. It is now planned to gradually expand so that all the suffering children in Shanghai can escape the fire and water and be able to sit on the mat. Not only will those who are directly affected benefit greatly, but the entire society will also benefit greatly. However, due to the soaring prices in recent years, the increase in expenditure has had a great impact on the association. All uses have been difficult to manage. They have no choice but to call for Bo, hoping that famous artists will give their great works to raise funds for charity sales. People with the same heart will definitely give assistance. If you would like to contribute, please send it to Room 414, 4th Floor, No. 169 Yuanmingyuan Road. The current situation of the association is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The association believes that most of the newspaper boys in Shanghai come from poor families. Driven by life, they sell newspapers along the road in wind and rain. They lose their education at a young age, which is very pitiful. Therefore, four newspaper boys' education classes have been established to accommodate more than 230 newspaper boys, providing them with courses to increase their knowledge so that they can find better jobs in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Most of the homeless beggar children in Shanghai are orphans without parents. No one feeds them and they are allowed to drift around, begging in the streets in the morning and sleeping in the alleys at night. The suffering of their lives is hard to describe. The association now has a center on Bailinan Road to accommodate more than 80 beggar children. In addition to providing clothing, food, accommodation, and education, specialized technicians are hired to teach them work skills so that they will not be unable to make a living when they grow up.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Finance Million Dollars Worth of US Dollar Sold <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, the British and American exchange rates were weak in the unofficial market, and the overall situation was loose. This was due to an abundance of sellers, with speculators throwing out large quantities. They even sold as much as a million US dollars. Additionally, Hong Kong Electric and China Light also sold, but foreign banks' appetite was sluggish, and the market momentum was unsustainable. After 2:30 PM, it briefly rose to 3 pence 6875 and 5 yuan 75. In the end, the closing price was 3 pence 65625 and 5 yuan 71875, which was 0.09375 and 0.1875 lower than the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Many Sellers Flooded the Market</p>
<p>In the early morning, overseas exchange rates showed that the British pound against the US dollar and against Shanghai were both flat, while the US dollar fell 0.25 against the British pound, with no change against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened for spot sales in the morning, with the British gold at 3 pence 578125 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 5625. Compared to the previous weekend, the British pound was down 0.015625, while the US dollar was up 0.03125. After the opening, speculators were the first to sell, and foreign banks like Chase and HSBC also showed a willingness to sell, further hardening the market. Foreign banks mutually traded spot British gold at 3 pence 59375. Chase, HSBC, and others sold November US dollar futures to fellow banks at 5 yuan 5625. Hong Kong Electric and China Light, along with speculators, sold spot US dollars to foreign banks like Yuli at 5 yuan 625. HSBC's listed price was announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax showed no increase or decrease. Afterwards, more and more Chinese merchants sold, and the market became looser. They sold last month's US dollars to foreign banks like Yuli at 5 yuan 65625. They then sold October US dollars to Chinese banks and Shanghai and foreign banks at 5 yuan 6875. In the afternoon, Chase also sold November US dollar futures to fellow banks at 5 yuan 65625. The market closed at 3 pence 640625 for British gold and 5 yuan 65625 for US dollars.</p>
<p>The Whole Day Was in a Loose State</p>
<p>The market remained loose in the afternoon. The opening price was 3 pence 671875 for British gold and 5 yuan 6875 for US dollars. After speculators and Hong Kong Electric sold, it became even looser. Spot US dollars were sold to foreign banks at 5 yuan 71875. A certain bank also sold October US dollar futures to HSBC and Yuli at 5 yuan 75. Additionally, Chinese banks also sold October US dollars to foreign firms at 5 yuan 78125. At that time, the current premium rose to 3 pence 6875, while the US dollar fell to 5 yuan 75. After that, the number of sellers decreased, and the market stabilized slightly. By the evening, the banks' selling prices were 3 pence 65625 for British gold and 5 yuan 71875 for US dollars, 3 pence 640625 for November British gold and 5 yuan 6875 for US dollars. As a result, compared to last Saturday, spot British was down 0.09375, US dollar was up 0.1875, November British was up 0.09375, and US dollar was down 0.15625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Loosened</p>

<h3 id="e80">Speculative Selling Reached Its Peak, Cash Rapidly Declined, Reaching a Low of 5,635 Yuan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold unofficial market plummeted rapidly, mainly because the United States hardened its attitude and was willing to go to war with the Axis powers. Moreover, the exchange market tended to harden, and operators had a strong psychology of short selling. The short positions accounted for eight or nine out of ten. In addition, the floating long positions emerged from time to time, and the market price became smaller and smaller. At one point in the afternoon, the latest low price of 5,635 yuan appeared. Then, some psychological changes occurred slightly, and some took advantage of the low price to profit and cover short positions, and new long positions also became active, so the evening closing price rebounded to 5,705 yuan. As a result, it fell by 125 yuan compared with last weekend, and the total transaction volume was 4,000 taels. Gold ornaments in gold shops were finally marked down by 10 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Fell Sharply by a Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the exchange market reported hard, and sellers competed to sell, and the opening price immediately fell into the 5,800 yuan mark. Then the securities firms exited at 50 yuan, lower than 5,790 yuan, which was 40 yuan lower than Saturday. Then, due to the loosening of foreign exchange, securities firms and cash firms competed to sell, and soon fell another 55 yuan, falling to 5,735 yuan. Then, relying on the help of silver shops and retail investors, it once rebounded to 5,775 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange industry and securities firms took the opportunity to sell short and increase their positions, and finally went down again. When it fell within 5,730 yuan, there were fewer buyers, and the sellers surged even more. At 11:30, it had fallen to 5,685 yuan. The price rebounded by 15 yuan before closing, but the closing price was only 5,690 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was immediately 10 yuan lower, falling to 5,680 yuan. Then it fell again to 5,670 yuan. Later, because the securities firms suddenly covered their short positions, it once rebounded to 5,700 yuan. However, because the silver shops and gold shops successively sold in the future, and there was a lack of maintenance in the market, the latest low price of 5,635 yuan was created. Later, the securities firms came again to cover their short positions, and the market situation stabilized. Soon, relying on the new long positions of the silver shops to pull up, it rebounded to the 5,700 yuan mark, rising to 5,715 yuan. Unexpectedly, the selling trend rose again at that time, and the money exchange industry mostly sold out, and it fell again to 5,680 yuan. Fortunately, the silver shops and securities firms still had a strong appetite, and they returned to the 5,700 yuan mark outside the market. The closing price was 5,705 yuan. As a result, it fell by 125 yuan compared with last weekend, and the price fluctuated by 155 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash firms' standard gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornaments Gold Finally Marked Down by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold ornaments per tael was unchanged at the beginning. It was marked down by 10 yuan at about 11:00, and then down by 10 yuan again at about 2:00 pm. At 4:00 pm in the evening, it rebounded by 10 yuan. As a result, Da Tong Bank changed to 590 yuan, and the new banks' price was similar to the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Foreign Currencies Weakened <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was that the various news about domestic and foreign affairs rumored in the market were all favorable to the sellers, so the spot gold fell sharply and the foreign exchange weakened. Therefore, people's hearts were restored to emptiness, and the supply from all parties was extremely abundant. The British and American gold pounds finally fell by three yuan, and the British gold notes were still stable at the beginning, and finally fell by one yuan. The American gold notes fell by four corners and three points, and the supply of Hong Kong notes was endless, and the price fell by nine points. Singapore, Robi, Canada, Philippines and other notes were not short of sellers, and the market price fell by one corner unanimously. There was a slight turnaround in Japanese gold notes, and the market price rebounded by one point, and the evening market rose to one yuan, four corners and five points. The supply and demand of Korean notes were even, and the market price stood firm. The evening market was still one yuan, one corner and four points.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Yarn and Cotton Weaving, Limited Actual Sales, Unstable Yarn Prices, The Market With Large Fluctuations Was Created by Speculation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply last week, turned into an up-and-down situation yesterday. This situation was entirely caused by speculative enthusiasm. However, people's hearts generally looked up, but foreign exchange rose sharply, and gold fell sharply, so that the floating long positions were unstable, and the general hat-snatching generation gathered in the market, specializing in embracing the trend of power, so it rose again and again, and fell even more. As for the actual situation, except for the Hong Kong gang who had a slight need, the others were silent as usual. Today, 1,615 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the morning, the current yarn market opened, and the market atmosphere was still tense. The twenty-count Double Horse head market opened at 1,190 yuan, opening a parallel market. As soon as this price opened, the buying sound was thunderous, and the sellers did not dare to shout. It went straight to the peak of 1,216 to 7 yuan. Seeing that foreign exchange was released and the gold price fell, at the same time, it was rumored that the Lanfeng standard yarn had stopped the board, and for a while, the wind and the crane were roaring, and people were panicked. It was also disturbing, and in a flash it fell to 1,165 yuan. At this time, it was nearly 11 o'clock, and the floating short positions came up to fill, and it rose back one step, and closed at 1,175 yuan, and then 10 yuan less. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 5,885 bales. The amount of purchase by each gang is listed on the left,</p>
<p>Industry peers 5,400 Hong Kong 485</p>

<h3 id="e83">Cotton Buying and Selling, Mostly by Fellow Traders <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is worse than last weekend. This is because the yarn price has fallen, and the foreign exchange has grown sharply, resulting in scattered people's hearts and sluggish factory needs. However, mutual buying and selling among peers and football transactions are still considered not bad. Today, 630 bales of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, the market situation is quite active. Later, due to the good spot transactions and the purchase of overseas cotton merchants, the closing price was three to five pounds higher than the previous day. India's forecast rose by more than one rupee yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have become increasingly active recently. The cotton price has not become cheaper due to the loose rise of the exchange rate, but has risen step by step. Compared with the selling price last week, it has risen by four to five yuan or more. Traders even have the pain of not being able to buy foreign cotton. The general mindset is extremely strong, so it is expected that raw cotton will still rise in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Grain, Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Can Arrive, Yesterday's Market Original Package Has Fallen Sharply, Newly Harvested Rice Arrivals Are Also Strong <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice is coming in continuously. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (June 6th), loaded with 600 bags from Hong Kong. The Yuezhou Wheel also arrived at the port on June 6th, carrying 4,546 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel also carried 622 bags from Hong Kong, and the Jardine Matheson's Fusheng Wheel also carried 1,500 bags from Hong Kong. They have been unloaded separately yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel loaded with 7,059 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, as listed in the previous Japanese column. The Taiyuan series of Yingzhou Wheels loaded with 7,939 bags of private foreign rice, and this is corrected. (Zu)</p>
<p>The foreign rice market opened early in the morning, and the real sales shops were very sluggish due to the continuous price decline. Yesterday, the market price was flat and there were slight inquiries, so the high-priced foreign rice was seen to be tight, and the large merchants were also reluctant to sell. The market seemed to be stabilized. Then, due to the further loosening of foreign exchange, the pricing of foreign rice was lowered again, and the fixed cargo has already opened with 9,000 tons of French wheels. The Hong Kong-loaded cargo is expected to arrive soon, and the new Jingjian at the end of Dumi also arrived in an endless stream, so the hearts of the people were unanimous down. In the morning, it changed from firm to tired, and stood small at three corners of the wilderness. In the afternoon, it was cut by five or six corners. The original package of Yinghua Sima, which was returned, was even weaker. The Bank No. 2 Saigon, which opened at 82 yuan last week, fell to 79 yuan yesterday. The foreign warehouse goods fell to 77 and a half yuan in the afternoon, both of which saw a fall of about three yuan. The current foreign rice also dropped by one yuan on the whole day yesterday. No. 1 Saigon 71.2 yuan to 70 yuan, No. 2 66.7 yuan to 65.5 yuan, Small twist 63.4 yuan, Siamese No. 2 64.5 yuan to 63 yuan, Fire grain high 72.5 yuan to 72 yuan, The big city 70.5 yuan to 68.5 yuan, Rice tea 56.7 yuan,</p>
<p>Thick and thin broken rice has become a lost-order cicada. The stock is about to run out, and it is rarely seen on the market, and the asking price also lacks a certain standard. Only the early rice of Nanhang is sold for 80 yuan.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 stones of new Jingjian Heshang and pedal-powered rice are continuously transported, of which Yangjian is the most, and Jingmi and Dujian are limited, and the kiln species are mostly goods from the Xitang area, which are soft and cannot be stored for a long time, so the kiln species has a unique loose sales intention, and the guest stomach is also scattered, resulting in a sharp drop of two or three yuan, opening from 82 yuan to 79 yuan. The new Jing has a wide range of destinations, increasing by one yuan instead, especially 80 yuan, Zhongguan 77 yuan, Yangjian Pingping 64 yuan, leather 62 yuan, Dujian goods fresh stomach fragrance and rise one or two yuan, high from 69 yuan to 66 yuan. Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign goods, is flat in the sales market, and the cargo owners have no intention of selling urgently, and there is no change. They still open Jin Li Special Yuan 72 yuan, Chang Dan 71 yuan 70 yuan, Hong Kong Yuan 71.2 yuan, and then to about 70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Flour and Wheat Rise Secretly, Also Due to the Impedance of Arrivals <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Flour trading is not prosperous, and the situation is quite tight. This is because the current flour is becoming more and more scarce, and the factories are not willing to increase production for a while, so the retail in this street mostly lacks goods, and the covert sale is as high as 19 yuan per bag. Yesterday, the return goods of old Che Fen opened more than three cars, and the price reached 18 yuan and 50 cents, which was equal to the guest market, so the retail price was so high. It is also heard that foreign flour is out of stock due to the failure of fixed goods to arrive, and most of them are holding on, and the price is also rising by two or three secretly. The market is still advancing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's source of wheat was quite scarce, because the transportation on the way has been hindered by a certain party, and the factories have limited the price for purchase, and the vendors are watching each other, and the stock is also gradually thin. The holders are holding on to each other. It is heard that the asking price for goods sent to the concession is 27 yuan, but no formal transaction has been made. The scattered shipment to the factory is still priced according to the original market.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Securities, Domestic Debt Market Softened, Foreign Stocks Sold Short in Droves <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The securities unofficial market fell yesterday due to the exit of the long position, but because there were many who covered the short position when it was small, the closing price was still slightly better. However, the two types of B and E once saw new high prices in the morning. Because the C type lottery is approaching, the general people who are unwilling to see the lottery sell out in large numbers to exchange for other debts. The D type has been extremely firm these days. The market price of type E is not much different from that of type C, which is the proof of the exit of C and the entry of D or E. China is currently in an environment of invincibility. Now there is even talk of the United States blocking the Pacific Ocean, and the situation is becoming more and more favorable. The debt market itself should still be optimistic. Yesterday morning, it opened very firmly, and Type C rose to 9 yuan and 40 cents. Later, Lianyi Yitai Defu Xinchang and other long positions came out, and then fell back by three to five corners. Type B once saw a new high price of 61 yuan and 20 cents, and Type E once saw a new high price of 59 yuan. The situation of the long positions surging and selling was suddenly poor. In the afternoon, retail investors sold the most. No. 25 sold out in large numbers. Runde Xinchang Xinfu also sold out, but Lianyi has already returned to do more. Jiufeng Yiji Tongkang Tongshun Renchang and Hongda are all absorbing, and then three or four corners less, so the result is a consistent continuous fall of one and a half corners to six and a half corners. The total number of transactions totaled about 2 million yuan. Here is a brief table of the opening of the stock market by the public yesterday, as generally expected, the trend is unusually soft. Later, people's hearts became more and more empty, and the price became softer and softer, finally causing a fierce fall. The momentum was turbulent, and there was a general sense of uncontrollability. On the one hand, the long positions thought about retaining a part of their "residual profits" and reducing their holdings. On the other hand, the short sellers fueled the flames and tried their best to dump. The market situation wanted it not to fall, and it was difficult to worry about it. The closing potential is still extremely soft. The reasons for the decline in each stock are due to various "bad news" for half, and due to the public's psychological fear for the other half. However, according to the current situation, the prosperous period of many weeks has temporarily become a thing of the past, and the market situation seems to have turned to the other side again.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Oil Cake, Oil Market Waves Are Huge, The Market Rises and Falls Greatly <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning's oil market, due to the strong short side and rumors unfavorable to the long side, the general hoarding households sought to exit in large numbers, and the falling wind was violent for a time (the rise and fall of soybean oil was still limited). The market situation was chaotic, and at its most tired, soybean oil had dropped by two or three yuan, and raw oil had plummeted by five or six yuan, but in an instant there was a rumor that Qingdao had stopped new buying and selling. As a result, it rose again by one or two yuan. In short, speculation was rampant, reversing clouds and rain, and the waves were huge, which made the public suffer. A total of 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil were traded, and the price was 81 yuan and 50 cents. There were 600 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil, and the price was 92 yuan to 93 yuan. There were 700 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, and the price was 84 yuan to 79 yuan and 50 cents. More than 4,000 pieces were delivered in the lower part of October, and the price fell from 85 yuan and 50 cents to 79 yuan and 50 cents, and rose again to 81 yuan and 50 cents. At the closing, 250 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded, and the price was 107 yuan and 50 cents to 107 yuan. 100 barrels were delivered in the upper part of October, and the price was 110 yuan to 107 yuan and 50 cents. 100 barrels were called in the lower part of October, and the price was 112 yuan to 110 yuan. Yesterday, 600 cans of raw oil came from Yan, and today (June 8) 910 bags of sesame and 200 cans of sesame oil will be transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Piece Goods, Yarn Prices Plunged, Cotton Cloth Fell Back <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth The market was scattered yesterday, and the selling market fell back. This was because after the prices had been raised high for days, the current sales turned into a clear state, and the people who sold for profit gradually increased, and the foreign exchange was frequently loose, and the market could not be held. Each piece of cloth fell back by 25 cents to 50 cents, and the current sales only had scattered small amounts. There were more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth and flannel traded in this street, more than 100 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill traded by the Guangdong and Hong Kong representatives, more than 200 pieces of broadcloth, flannel and coarse cloth traded by the Yantai Weihaiwei representatives of the Northern Route, and the factories only opened small amounts of goods, with a slight decoration.</p>
<p>East Cloth Yesterday, due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, people's hearts were empty and timid, and speculative retail investors rushed to sell, and the falling wind was violent. The leading fine cloth once fell to 35 yuan, 80 cents and 90 cents, but the industry's thoughts were still stable, and the closing price rose back to 36 yuan and 25 cents. There were still transactions after the closing, and it opened at 36 yuan and 30 cents, which was about 1 yuan lower per piece than the market price last week, the fine twill fell by 50 cents to 70 cents, and the broadcloth fell by 4 cents per yard to 1 yuan and 7 and a half cents.</p>
<p>Export There are 1,585 pieces of piece goods to be transported to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Seafood, Yantai Tails Continue to Arrive <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Domestically produced shrimp tails. Yesterday, 20 boxes of Yantai Golden Hooks arrived and were sold immediately. The negotiated price was 390 yuan to 392 yuan. It was found that the quality of the goods was worse than before, so the price was also slightly cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Miscellaneous: Firewood Also "Controlled" <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Although the firewood market had very few goods arriving the previous week, it was still supported by chestnut and pine firewood coming from the occupied areas. Recently, the goods coming from that route have been intercepted by a certain military department, which prohibits their shipment. The firewood stored in this port is becoming increasingly scarce, causing concerns about the inability to cook due to lack of fuel. Naturally, the prices charged by businesses in the same industry have risen. Large-sized, bleached firewood is now one and a half yuan per bundle, "Chuanshan" firewood is about 75 cents per bundle, and small "Taiwan" firewood is three and a half bundles per yuan. Delivery from the warehouse requires an additional fee, and additional charges for hand-carrying.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Starting from "My Wife" <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>-- Ren Zhang</p>
<p>Even today, China has not escaped the social ideology of "valuing men over women." That is to say, China still maintains a male-centered society. As everyone knows, people generally refer to their husbands as "outer ones" and their wives as "inner ones." From this, we can draw the following conclusion: men can participate in activities in all sectors of society without restriction, while women can only do things in the small world of the family.</p>
<p>Thus, for thousands of years, such a situation has been created: women have lost their personal independence, and have become attached to men like slaves belonging to masters and cattle belonging to farmers. She relies on men to live, and her fate changes with the changes in men's fates.</p>
<p>Who decided this? It's society! On what grounds does society order women to become "inner ones"?</p>
<p>The fact is, after all, a fact. It is not that women are "unable to bear the burden," but that society subjectively believes they are "too weak to withstand the wind." On the other hand, it is also because women's social status is restricted, which significantly affects women's physical and intellectual development and progress. However, even under such social resistance, we can still discover women's abilities in various aspects: Hua Mulan and Qin Liangyu charged and fell into battle; Wu Zetian (regardless of her good or bad) could also rule China like other men; and since the Republic of China, many female politicians have emerged. Recently, women have participated in work in the rear; and if about half of the women were not participating in the Northwest Highway, I am afraid it would still be difficult to open to traffic.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion is very clear: if we admit that women are also human beings, then we should unconditionally respect their independence, because everyone has their own meaning and value for survival. On the other hand, if society can give women the opportunity to participate in activities, then women may not keep up with men at first, but in the long process, progress is predictable. As for women having to give birth and raise children, this is just a technical issue, because as the number of women participating in social work gradually increases, nurseries, infant homes, and kindergartens will also increase universally.</p>

<p>-- Wan Jiachun</p>
<p>Ke:</p>
<p>You must find my crooked handwriting, like the steps of a drunken wanderer, unfamiliar, right?</p>
<p>When I look at the passing clouds in the blue sky, I think of a distant friend. She is like a ray of sunset, shining on the clouds, creating beautiful霞彩, which is very hot to look at, but what you touch is a gust of evening breeze. How can I not turn around and think of my loving mother, who would add a cold coat to my heart!</p>
<p>Autumn wind sweeps the fallen leaves again, reminding me that it has been a year since we met. The autumn sun in the French Park shone on your new black-and-white-spotted jacket, and a sense of elegance and洒之is deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>Being in an adverse environment, yet shouldering the dark gate and looking forward to the bright future, is precisely your excellent quality. However, there are also shortcomings, just like everything you pointed out yourself. Overcome them, of course, you have to be a little more calm and your understanding has to be clearer.</p>
<p>A chance encounter brought me and some buddies together on the ancient soil. Some of them are the sons of capitalists, and some are the daughters of millionaires. Their parents do not lack the usual so-called "love," and want to keep them in a greenhouse without experiencing any wind, frost, rain, or snow. However, however, they abandoned their comfortable lives and went to the barren soil to shed their hard-earned blood and sweat. Oh, my friend, this is indeed a miracle, but how real it is!</p>
<p>History is cruel. It does not care about the sadness of parents, it ignores the person-seeking advertisements on newspapers with tears soaking the back of the paper, and it does not care about the tightly knit brows of young people. The chariot of the old man of history carries batches of outstanding young people into the arms of the motherland. However, can the gestation and birth of a new and fortunate society be exchanged for mere partings and sorrows? More sacrifices must be paid!</p>
<p>I heard that Yun is already working. I don’t know how he is doing recently? He calls himself a "goody two-shoes," which I greatly dislike. Because a "goody two-shoes" will never hate evil like an enemy. At best, he can only be good to himself. However, there will never be a "moderate" person in the world who neither does evil nor fights against evil forces. In such a society, the result of being a goody two-shoes is often still to become an accomplice of the evildoer!</p>
<p>Shanghai has become an isolated island. Not only are the houses overcrowded, and the roads are filled with pedestrians, but even the "channels of speech" are narrow. Let's stop here.</p>
<p>I wish you health! Chun</p>

<p>In the journey of life, in the river of life, there should be occasional ripples, waves, even a storm in the dark day; otherwise I would be too lonely, the little boat of my fragile life may be swallowed by a huge wave, or smashed to pieces; but do not be afraid, I must hold my helm steady and fight against this storm! In the arduous struggle, I can temper my will; in the perilous battle, I can show the perseverance of human beings; and, I want to see the beautiful and calm surface of the river after the storm has passed.</p>

<p>Regarding the question of "Where should women go?", we have received many articles from readers in recent days, especially from female readers, expressing their opinions, which makes us feel very honored. What particularly moves us is that many readers are "first-time contributors." Most of them express their opinions based on their personal experiences in real life. Although they cannot be said to be completely correct, they are very representative of the views of women in general at present. Regarding the manuscripts discussing the question of "Is this a sacrifice?", if any readers still want to express their opinions, we hope that they can send their manuscripts within three days. We plan to collect all the noteworthy opinions and publish a small special issue or special edition to conclude the discussion.</p>
<p>Next time, we plan to publish Ms. Jiang Yihui's "Our Road" first. We hereby announce this in advance.</p>

<p>Chapter 9 Amazing News</p>
<p>When Yu Gantang said these last few words, he unintentionally showed a fierce expression, like a warrior on the battlefield, preparing to fight the enemy hand-to-hand. Hawthorne stared at him, and the smile on the corner of his mouth gradually disappeared and became very serious. I took advantage of his silence and couldn't help but directly scold this dissipated young man.</p>
<p>I said coldly: "What a irreconcilable! What courage! Do you know what era this is? What mission are you carrying? If you use this courage to respond to all the difficult knowledge, the welfare of the people, and all the difficult problems on the journey of life, then I cannot help but pay you my respects. Now think about it, what are you using your courage for? This is just a simple—not even talking about love—pornographic issue, but you are ignoring life, reputation, parents, and the country, and preparing to risk your life to commit suicide and murder!" I myself felt that these words were a bit excessive, but it was really due to "being unable to restrain myself."</p>
<p>Although Hawthorne did not speak, he sighed deeply, clearly expressing sympathy for my interjection.</p>
<p>The young man's "fierce expression" instantly turned into "fearful expression." He no longer had the courage to look at me, and his voice trembled severely when he answered. Mr. I now know that this is wrong. Otherwise, I would not have come to see you. But I really didn't kill anyone. Mr. Hawthorne, do you believe me after all?</p>
<p>Hawthorne neither accepted nor denied it, and continued to say: "Keep talking. Your own actions last night have not been explained clearly."</p>
<p>Yu Gantang replied: "Okay, I'll tell you. Last night, I accompanied a classmate to see a movie at the Jindou Theater. After it was over, we ate some snacks. I escorted her back——"</p>
<p>"Her? Is it a female classmate?—Alas, you are really busy! Okay, keep talking."</p>
<p>"We hired a car and passed by the gate of Lizha's house. I saw Zhao Boxiong, crouching outside the short wall outside the gate."</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly cut him off and said: "You saw him?—What time was that?"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang hesitated slightly and replied: "Probably around twelve o'clock. Because the movie theater was over before half past eleven. Eating snacks didn't take more than half an hour.</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded. "Okay, tell me in more detail. You definitely saw Zhao Boxiong, there's no mistake?" (130)</p>

<p>-- New Sound</p>
<p>Bad Luck Ends and Good Luck Begins</p>
<p>One year, probably in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Xiao Mengqi was performing at the Old Tianchan Stage on Er Ma Road. The play was "Eight Searches of Zou Yinglong," and it was quite popular. At the same time, the lead actor on stage was Furongcao, who is now very popular. On the day he went on stage, there were no dramas for him to perform, so he only played a not-very-important Zou Madam in the play "Eight Searches of Zou Yinglong." Although his position was not important, his performance was very wonderful. At the end, when Zou Yinglong was about to escape into the water prison, Furongcao's performance was even more enthusiastic, vivid, and colorful. At the time, I saw this play and recognized Furongcao as a good actor with artistic talent, who would definitely become popular in the future. Who knew that later, the Tianchan Stage changed its style and used the newly compiled play "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince" as its slogan. This time, Furongcao was ruined alive. Needless to say, the main roles in the play "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince" were of course Chang Chunheng first, Liu Xiaoheng second, followed by Meng Hongmao's Prince Anle, Liu Yuqin's Consort Li, and Liu Songting's Guo Huai. Furongcao's Empress Liu, the West Palace Concubine, could only be considered the sixth-ranked Jinshi. Such a good material, even Liu Xiaoheng and Liu Yuqin couldn't compare to him, wouldn't that be wronged people to death? Moreover, the Empress Liu played by Furongcao was a bad seed in the play. The audience had a bad impression of Empress Liu, especially the ignorant women and children. At that time, several of my relatives were Civet Cat fans. When they came back from watching the play, they always said that Furongcao was not good. In fact, it was Empress Liu who was not good. How could Furongcao be bad? But for this reason, Furongcao's reputation gradually declined. Civet Cat! It really harmed Furongcao miserably.</p>
<p>When Chang Chunheng left Tianchan, the role of Bao Gong was replaced by Xiao Mengqi, and the popularity of Civet Cat gradually declined. By the twenty-third book, it had become the end of its rope, and it soon stopped performing. The Civet Cat's bad luck arrived, and Furongcao has since had good luck. How many women are on the road to self-destruction. As the playwright said: If women are not weak-willed, men will not be able to seduce them. According to reports, Miss Shangguan Yunzhu was abandoned by the United Nations for her love of vanity. Now that Miss Shangguan Yunzhu is personally starring in this play, is she also moved by it?</p>

<p>According to Feng Gengguang, a senior figure in the banking industry, Mei Lanfang's savings will only be enough to last for half a year from now. Since Mrs. Mei, Fu Zhifang, spends a lot of money, consuming more than ten thousand yuan a year, this has created Mei Lanfang's difficult situation. According to Mr. Feng, who used to be the president of the Bank of China and supported Mei the most, the friendship between the two is closer than flesh and blood. Mr. Feng's words are credible. As for whether Mei Lanfang will reappear on stage as a result, it is unknown.</p>

<p>Gao Zhanfei is very important and resides quietly on the South Bank, rarely venturing into the city. Bai Yang is not often seen by Old Gao's side. One reason is the busyness of work, but also the numerous social engagements keep her too busy.</p>
<p>Although Li Lili and Luo Jingyu already have a child, reliable sources say that Lili's trip to the north to film "Storm on the Border" will bring scandalous rumors, and that new romantic entanglements are feared to occur after her return to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Situ Huimin came to Chongqing to direct "Hometown of White Clouds" over eight months ago. Initially, rumors spread that Situ was quite close to the film's lead actress, Feng Zi (Feng Ji Ren), but recent observations indicate that Feng Zi is approaching not Situ, but playwright Sun Shiyi.</p>

<p>Yanqiu, Wang Yuhua, has been off stage since the Lunar New Year, having left Shanghai for nearly half a year. Recently, she accepted a lucrative engagement to perform again in Shanghai. Li Shengzao and others will finish around the Double Tenth Festival, and the new star will be seen on the red carpet around mid-October.</p>
<p>Recently, among female Cheng School performers, Zhang Eyun, Wang Yuhua, and Hou Yulan are most praised. Eyun and others have performed in roles like Hua Shan, while Yuhua only performs Qing Shan roles, cautiously preserving the purity of the style. She has studied it diligently privately. In "Mandarin Duck Tomb" and "Jade Capital Taoist," both her singing and acting are excellent, almost indistinguishable from the original. This is highly appreciated by the aficionados. Last time she traveled south, she was hindered by illness, and her voice was not fully clear, leaving something to be desired. Now she has recovered, and her voice and appearance should be vastly different from the past. Since Yushuang's return north, the famous performers who have come to the Shanghai stage, such as Mao Shilai, Wu Suqiu, and Tong Zhiling, are all known for their Xun School performances. We, the enthusiasts of the Cheng School, suffer from having no music to enjoy. Now that Yuhua is here, the Cheng enthusiasts can feast their eyes and ears.</p>
<p>The story's content is as follows: Mrs. Hu, due to her worship of money, throws herself into the arms of the wealthy Mr. Hu, abandoning the true love of Mr. Wu. As a result, she is pushed off the balcony by Mr. Wu and injured, later regretting it. However, seventeen years later, her two daughters—Peiying and Peihua—follow in her footsteps, thus suspecting each other and heading towards destruction together. The plot is quite compact and feels somewhat cold.</p>
<p>The play is divided into five acts: the first and fifth acts have the same props, and the second, third, and fourth acts also have little change, except that there are two bottles of poison wine on the table.</p>
<p>Shangguan Yunzhu plays both Hu Peiying and Hu Chushan. She is more lively in the role of Hu Chushan than Hu Peiying. Leng Jing plays Mrs. Hu. The makeup in the first and last acts seems too young. Someone in their forties or fifties cannot be made up to look so young. Her lines are very fluent, making her the best at expressing emotions in this play. Lin Fen's Zhang Ma and Shao Dan's Hu Peihua are very good at portraying their personalities. Hong Wei's Mrs. Qian also adds a lot of color to the play. Cheng Ying plays Qu Qiwen, Li Heng plays Tian Xiuli, and Xiao Hui plays the maid, only Si Yun is considered competent.</p>
<p>The prompting sound in the first and fourth acts is too loud, which is a minor flaw in this public performance. All nine actors in this play are women, which is also very special. In short, in this Shanghai of extravagant indulgence, like Mrs. Hu said: "Vanity triumphs over reason." I don't know if there are...</p>
<p>Twenty-second Game: Intrigues</p>
<p>Xue Zhengwei; Han Da Ni proposed; Red wins first</p>
