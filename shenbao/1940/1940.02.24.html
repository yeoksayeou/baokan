<p>社評</p>
<h3>日用生活品調整之進行</h3>
<p>煤球平沽，麵粉平價，洋米牛耀，生活宜可稍减恐慌矣，而一般人仍惶惶不安，若憂患方深，艱難彌甚；此固由於驚慌之餘，驟難鎭定，或由於事出强制辦理，未能名實盡符。亦有鑒於環境不變，則無論用盡人治方法，苦心維持，終不敵其破壞之容易。單論米糧，常錫之米，久已絕跡於滬上；最近搜刮愈周，蘇同靑角之米，亦在綑載以去，而由虹口轉人租界區內之杜米能有幾何，非特寥寥，幾乎絕迹。又豈止蘇省產米之區而已，即如河北平津各地，稻米貴至一百二十元，麵粉至二十一元，雖由於日人所主持之「聯銀偽鈔」惡性膨脹之必然結果，據聞稻米大部被日方統制收買，運回本國食用；東北維糧，過去亦可運入關內接濟，近亦受日關東軍之統制，不准外運。慶父不除，魯難未已，是亦中國民食未有之厄運也。</p>
<p>雖然，上海民食，儘多城狐社鼠，憑藉作祟，洋米幾乎日有到滬，數不在少，存米至無可相容，儘多搭建臨時棚舍，千倉萬箱，而米價羿騰，洶洶未已。前數日西貢一號洋米且貴至五十一二元，（一市石）厚薄粳尖，暗盤遂均在五十餘元，項粳有非六十元相近之價不辦矣。惟無論其麪粉，為煤球，一經平價，市面立見平靜，如米業口口聲聲維持民食，實行業規，而就其事實所昭示，除一時間為應付環境，暫時欽跡之外，日久則舊熊復萌跳跟如故；暗盤層出，充耳若不聞，觸目若不見，日洋米固不受限制也，而不知操縱洋米，即所以操縱其他米糧；抬高洋米之價格，亦所以促成日用生活各品之漲價。夫限價原以濟一時之急，至若持久之圖，平準之道，豈限價所能收效，何况今日所急，在囤積居奇，分配不勻。投機操縱，無法加以制裁耳！囤積居奇，志在大利，非饜其慾望，雖倉有紅粟，道有餓莩不顧也，分配不勻，有勢有財者不虞無食，食力之輩，往往求升米而不得。即日辦理平糶，而就目覩所及，仍是粥少僧多，非「手長者」雖鵠立竟日或奔跑數次不能得。然求分配之平勻，又豈咄嗟可立就，非有精密之貧民戶口調查，割分地段，分配均勻，保持秩序，不易奏效。今則常有為數斗之米，一包之鈣，有費耗其一日之工作，尙不可得。况與社會福利有關之事業，平時既缺乏統計，臨事又失所準備，以致事變之來，倉皇應付，安得不予人以乘間抵隙之機會哉！</p>
<p>艱巨之職責，當前之困難，既一時不易解除，大多數市民之痛苦，不容不顧，則就日用生活所必需之米麥雜糧油豆鈣粉以至於蔬菜果瓜之屬，似應由各業中之公正有為分子，合組一委員會，並延攬各公團代表，實際辦理調查到銷存積調劑事宜，進而謀分配之均勻，物價之平準，市塲之調整。蓋各業各有其組織，非業外人所能明悉，故必集各業於一堂，分工合作，而後其事易舉。往昔集會之弊·在能說不能行，一會之後，即算了事，執行如何，有所不問也，故鮮成績。今果為戰時民食着想，則充任委員者皆須其有為公衆服務之精神，熟悉各該業之內容，籌牛易公允之策，為民食商情兼顧之計。而在各業，亦應為大衆着想，杜絕投機操縱之打為，使物價歸於安定。物價安定，非僅消費者蒙其惠，亦工商界受其益。而今日物價所以不安定，既非為法幣幣値之影響，蓋法幣對外滙率，姑不論法定滙價，即如上海黑滙市傷，若無投機商欲橾縱百物而亦操縱外滙黃金；又若無「聯銀偽鈔」跌價，北方紛以「聯鈔」換法幣，兌換外滙黃金，滙價決無變更之可能。亦非基於生產之不足；而完全由於不正當之武力財力所造成。夫以人力造成者應以人力戡定之，人力不臧，何尤於天，大衆如能解決其生活上之苦痛，亦惟有各盡人力以挽頹運耳！</p>
<h3>蘇聯紅軍紀念日　何應欽招待　蘇籍各顧問　何氏卽席致詞：中蘇兩國正如弟兄為世界和平而奮鬥永久保持寶貴友誼携手趨向光明大道</h3>

<h3>東北游擊隊　勢力雄厚</h3>
<p>——蘇報之記載——</p>
<p>重慶　莫斯科消息勞動報刊有關於中國東北各省游擊戰之長文一則、略謂、東北全境均有游擊隊之不斷進攻、已使日軍士氣頹喪、日軍加人游繫隊者、已屢見不鮮、日本在東北所施之軍國主義、雖造成恐怖之狂浪、而國家分散運動則益為普遍、游繫隊之勢力、亦益為龐大、日軍之「肅淸後方」工作、每遭遇游擊隊之堅決抵抗而歸於失敗、（二十三日電）</p>

<h3>流言叢生　金價又昂</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、趨勢由疲轉堅、結果回漲三十一元之多、實以市上有央日簽訂密的傳說、兼及外滙緊縮、使人心復轉、至晨開為叫千七百八十五元、計大十三元、原因錢兌業與金號買進、嗣有某錢兌業力塞、且銀樓帮與證券帮亦先後吐出、遂一度盤小至叫千七百四十八元低價、旋某金號乘賤撈進、且斯時謠風四起、證券帮等遂轉賣為買、加之港帮亦暗中活動、冉以外滙報軟、市勢回漲甚速、不久遂昂達叫千七百九十元、午收略挫、為四千七百八十元、收後董堅、午後尤挺、開市即高至四千八百元後、更因外滙續緊、某錢兌業力買、遂飛躍至四千八百十八元高價、人後金號傾吐、外滙轉平、曾回入西千八百元大關、卒以錢兌業及散戶等復來拖入、晚收遂告四千八百〇三元、全天交易約二千五百兩光景、銀縷飾金掛大五元、海關余等仍平、</p>

<h3>外幣轉升</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊、需要續殷、市價挺秀，英美金票講吸復盛、市價稍昂、上午英金票升為五十三元八角、美金票升為十四元四角一一分下午市仍緊張、晚市英會巢冉升五十四元、美金票再升為十四元四角四分、香港票法郎票拱給不爽、坎稟及斐律濱票跟隨緊張、日金票微升、晚市為元二角九分、朝鮮巢稍弱、晚市為元零五分、昨日市價、英美金鎊、俱升五角、英金票升三角、美金巢升·角一分香港票升二分、法郎票升七厘、坎票升角、斐律　票升五分、其他各幣未史、</p>

<h3>證券　洋股反動　會德豐股票大跌</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况已恢復上下午全日交易、市况仍因押款滿期貨出籠、繼續趨小、惟原有之大戶多頭、尙未見出脫、大空頭現貨則仍不斷流出、市塲因此謠言又起、無稽之談不足深論、但買氣過湧、自然引起疑慮、多頭暫抱觀望態度、趨勢有續小之可能、昨日上午、市况安定、散戶頗有需要、愼康及聯和均有買進、聯益已在轉頭賣出、及同順六十四號亦有供給、價比前日略堅、午後忽有無精之謠、同時滿期貨續有求售、丙種開出即打破八元、潤利號賣出最湧、久豐空頭加碼、樂茂松茂等均有賣出、市塲謠言因此愈盛、市價結果、除丁種因隔日跌落過鉅、反動回好四角外、餘則續小一二角左有、成交總數共計的八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交漢冶萍股二百股、價為三元角半、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、晨初開盤甚穩、有不少補空交易、値得注意、下午會德豐股突自一百十一元高價在落至九十八元、此價不乏有人維持、收盤重又回至一百零四允、因此種萬外變幻之結果、市塲其餘部份趨勢亦難捉模、惟各股跌時、大都獲得買方支持、</p>
<p>倫敦二日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、俱告平穩、上下檔各債券均無變動、</p>

<h3>紗花　期紗交易日增　二三月套利　可獲二分鈿</h3>
<p>紗市仍屬良好、但實際生意依然呆滯無神、獨期貨絨交異常興旺、三月期雙馬交易日增、價格較二月期高昂二十元、本日最高價做至八百八十二元、二月期為八百六十二元、相差二十元、套利者可獲二分鈿、市塲議論謂原料放鬆無望、心思大都看好、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因外滙及金價平穩、人氣尙安靜　開小二三元、二十支雙馬本月份價為八百五十八元、直跌至五十五元、旋以多頭活動、及某紗漲風劇烈、人心激昂、漸漸上升至八百六十二元、少頃有一部份獲利者了結、又回挫二三元、但收盤以後、又復回上、查半日間成交統計二千六百七十五包、行情二十支雙馬與上日不相上下、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>日商採辦　通棉打包　做二百二十七元</h3>
<p>本棉交易、較前為夥、日商開始採辦、故人心尤振、華廠申新亦活動購買、同行互相買賣、亦屬熱鬧、所以棉市依然挺括、通州打包、已做到二百十七元、蘇北來源僅通花三百零八包、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日為華盛頓之誕生日、美國停市一天、印度棉市昨日連同預測漲起二羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、利物浦漲二便士、</p>
<p>滬　外棉交易、廠方始終殊為靜寂、董因彼等前訂之貨、俱將陸續抵埠、故　意較為淡簿、同業則較為活躍，日來仍有小額交易、日方廠商聞有向同業廠搜購規貨、蓋因同業售價、較之洋行方面可康去十餘元之多也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>印棉一千七百件、英輪朋格拉號、自孟買運來昨午進口、停靠浦東其昌棧、該項棉印即卸於該棧房、（年）</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米再跌</h3>
<p>米市又見落後、昨則　心續虛、繼呈跌風、考其原因、不外乎一般店家、因平糶實行、無意多購、去路突滯、跌風因是續起、自晨至午、洋米價先後計降一元左右、計收盤一號西貢為四十八元、二號西貢四十五元、火絞四十六元、蓋因新國觀望、浮戶散囤莫不急於求脫、故回籠小絞西貢二號暹　二號晨市已降至每包五十四元四五角、旋賣方續貶、後市竟降至五十三元六角、尙乏整戶受納、後市形勢尙在看小中、即現西貢等晨市開價即小、午市已降小六七角至近元、後市又被回籠帶小半元光景、統市開現米三千包、回籠七八百噸、變元祗有國貨做開、計售溧陽特元四十四元、丹陽白元四十二元八角、較之前盤各短半元有奇厚薄粳等國米、聞暗盤未做開云、</p>
<h3>粉麥續降</h3>
<p>麵粉　現交淸閑如常、各廠拱給、除平價粉犧牲每天七千五百包外、迄未多售、昨日上午棧單貨市面平穩、嗣以客帮內地去化均靜、美國農部又有增加出口津貼消息、及米價步跌、人心帶餒、聞老車牌棧單初開十四元七角、後市降至十四元五角、其他各牌概無正式成交、市面漸入　釀狀態、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日麥價續見鬆落、速日　屬方面、進胃頗呆、而協鑫及强生廠等則進　不弱、惟吃盤重視、且近來洋商兜攪洋麥甚殷、故昨日售開之常錫麥祗售二十五元五角、成交共計二十車云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂加入鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市荷蘭粗砂轉鬆、因荷蘭電產價又小一角、為荷幣九盾七角、C.I.E.&amp;.K.G例、公會劃盤、二四粗砂本棧小三角、六十一元七角、外棧新貨小元許、六十一元、老貨小一元五角、為六十元、轉口貨小一元、為四十八元、太古糖升起半元許、因產地堅立、某貨亦見上升、Ｂ嘜西棧貨六十三元、東棧貨六十二元五角、Ｃｗ嘜西棧貨洋十二元、東棧貨六十二元、ＣＸ嘜西棧六十一元、東棧六十元〇七角、ＤＹ嘜西棧六十元〇七角、東棧六十元〇四角、ＨＸ嘜西棧六十元〇五角、東棧六十元〇二角、ＨＨ嘜車赤西棧四十五元、東棧四十四元半、荷赤未更、ＭＰ嘜四十八元、wＡ嘜四十七元半、本廠貨均小　元、雪白六十一元、本冰七十三元半、晶明冰七十五元、國糖昨無聞出、因號方還想上升、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布呢羢</h3>
<p>春錯漸見開展</p>
<p>棉布國產棉布市况、客銷漸見開展、人心堅定、惟銀根頗緊、故下月期貨戰現墊價每疋拔高將近一元、昨現貨市盤粗布細布斜紋每疋漲一角至二角半、漂染布售盤允堅、現墊廉價貨額本街囤胃仍濃、浙東戰局穩定、溫台帮購辦突旺、成交綸昌怡和鴻章等廠出品漂染布及白貨粗細布五百餘件、本街成交漂染印花布及坯布粗細布斜紋四百餘件、粵港帮南洋帮辦斜紋色布漂布印花布二萬數千疋、蘇浙皖內地批發亦漸發動、</p>
<p>呢羢　各貨、昨日春銷已起、薄花呢·啥咪呢·華特呢·直貢呢·厚薄嗶嘰·單面花呢·海林棒·法蘭羢·海列司·派立斯·羽紗呢·與裏襯類之絲光羽紗·花洋布·法西　·黑炭　·軟　袋布等、跑街掮客兜銷、交易亦頗煞閘、西服裁縫帮進胃較健、公茶會上市氣仍堅漲、標準行情大都看好、</p>
<h3>絲茶　生絲呆滯</h3>
<p>人造絲進口二千箱</p>
<p>紐約絲市、因華盛頓紀念無市、橫濱現貸漲二十五元、達期二十六元、然較前收盤則略回小、本埠絲市、白廠經在呆滯中、蓋國外絲市飄忽、人心猶豫觀望也、白頭洋行聯茂等昨絲交活躍、沔陽搖經等做聞六十擔，價漲三〇元云、</p>
<p>意國人造絲大批到滬、前日（二十二日）意輪康脫粵安克孟諾號、自意國來滬、裝來二千零零六箱、昨已起卸於虹口公和祥棧房、（祖）</p>
<h3>紐約生絲進口减少上月內外絲價　下降甚堪驚人</h3>
<p>一月份紐約生絲狀况、一般狀况、仍屬不振、蓋最近數月來紐約生絲統計、不論其為進口或存銷數量、均在萎縮中、故絲價之無實際基礎、愈形明顯矣、茲查一月份、紐約進口减少一六九〇担、存底增三六一五担、銷用增八三七八担、</p>
<p>一月份之絲價、受投機操縱、及日美商約續訂無望之影響、絲價下瀉驚人、計橫濱現貨自二三八〇元跌至一八〇〇元、遠期二三七八元跌至一六〇二元、前者跌三八〇元、後者跌七七六元、紐約近期自四·一一元跌至一·八五元、跌一元二角六分、折合申市、每担跌二一〇〇元、本埠白廠經則自六三〇〇元跌至五〇〇〇元、計跌二〇〇元云、</p>
<h3>五金馬口鐵價仍貴</h3>
<p>五金交易、連日來頗稱活潑、就中馬口鐵一項、因是貨價格之昂貴、致使多方不敢下手、昨市成交者僅幾十箱而已、然行情因成本關係、未見鬆懈、刻市如一百八十磅意雙速鐵、每箱沽一百八十五元、一百八十磅美貨售一百九十元、二百磅美雙連鐵一百零五元、九十磅單運馬口鐵沽一百十元、一百磅單連每箱喊一百十五元光長耳</p>

<h3>對症下藥</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>我說在生活的戰爭中，飛漲的物價不是我們的眞敵人，意思並不是說物價的威脅不嚴重；我說投機囤積的奸商小是我們的眞敵人，也並不是說奸商不可惡之謂。在目前，我以爲民衆的生活還是要設法加以安定，物價還是應該想法子予以抑平，對於投機囤積的奸商，還是要積極加以取締與制裁的。可是這些的最大的效果，祇不過可以暫時稍蘇民困而已，對於人民的生計，是得不到根本上的解決的。</p>
<p>有人勸投機的商人拿出良心來，把目前的民生問題看做道德的問題，這種覜點是不十分正確的。這種看法是頭痛書頭脚痛醫脚的辦法，是太把複雜的社會問題簡單化了。還有人勸民衆要鎭靜下來，這種勸告的用意是好的，從整個社會的立塲上看起來也是無可厚非的，可是在水深火熱的飢餓綫上掙扎着的民衆，他們的生活環境和經濟狀况實在是不容許他們鎭靜下來的。你說「不要急一，飢腸轆轆的肚子却不容許你不急！</p>
<p>現社會病情的複雜，病勢的沉重，已經不是重振道德的甘草或是「安心勿噪」的空言所能根本救治的了。我們得先把病情察看淸楚，才不致藥石投，才能對症下藥！</p>

<h3>無聲飛機</h3>
<p>— 貿立煌</p>
<p>許多年來，各國的軍事專家，都先後預言，不久會有一種飛機，無聲無響地飛來轟炸我們的都市，在事前是沒有人會知道到底是甚麼一回事。這一種利器，是無法預防的。</p>
<p>一種完全無聲的飛機，其有助於旅行和商業的發展是無待贅述的，因爲發動機和推進機所造成的聲饗，實在足以使人發狂。</p>
<p>近年來，各國對於研究無聲飛機所耗的金錢，已無慮千萬。試騐絕聲材料以製造一種客艙，使空中旅行得以舒適無擾，道種的費用又不知有多少。但一想到無聲轟炸機所造成的恐怖局面，就不禁令人心寒膽戰。</p>
<p>要是將戰器分爲攻擊和防禦二種，那麼無聲的軍用機，要算是最厲害的攻擊利器了。</p>
<p>假使有一隊這種完全無聲的飛機由敵國飛來轟炸我們的主要都市，我們一定無法知道，更談不到派機去中途截擊牠們。因爲預防空襲的第一步，是端賴乎聲音，我們的防空偵察器旣然聽不到敵機的迫近，如何能够通知防禦的空軍呢？</p>
<p>假定這種飛機決定畫間前來襲擊，我們雖看得見，但是沒有聲音，怎樣去推測我們高射砲的射程呢？因爲射程推測器，大都是靠收聲器所收的聲音作根據的。沒有相當強烈的聲音，我們的防禦設備也就無能爲力了。</p>
<p>要是道種機隊改在夜間舉行空襲，因爲收聲器收不到聲昔，我們的探空燈也沒有多大用處了。這樣我們在空中的防禦機就無法去尋覓它們的目的物了。多雲和黑夜之天，是無聲轟炸機發揮其威力最有效之時。</p>
<p>假使眞的發生這樣的惰形怎麼辦呢？我們唯一的辦法，就是反炸敵人的根據地。</p>
<p>但是有人要問：「眞的有無聲飛機這種東西嗎？」</p>
<p>我們聽見無聲飛機到現在已經好多年了。一九一七至一八年，我們就風聞在西戰綫有無聲飛機出現了。以後也常常聽見過，不久之前，我們會接到時有一架神秘的無聲飛機飛過北歐各國的報告。</p>
<p>法國政府有幾次會報告，有一架無聲飛機飛過瑪基諾防綫。還有一個時候，有一架塞魯開引擎裝置伏克無聲器的飛機，在距地五百呎的天空飛越幾個觀察家的頭上。事後他們都衆口一聲地說，要是他們沒有舉首仰視，必以爲是一輛在附近馬路馳騁的汽車。</p>
<p>一九三二年德人就已經把一具高馬力引擎的聲音，消滅百分之七十了。假使德國的工程師，已經把無聲機製造成功了，那麼他們所知道關於推進王韜的聲音和設計方面，已經比別國前進許多了。</p>
<p>不久之前，美國的飛機製造家，曾用寇等司引擎裝入陶格拉斯偵察機內，造成一架無聲機。在八千呎的上空，用最高速度飛翔，在地面居然聽不到聲音。後來再加上新的掩蔽化裝術，據目擊的人說，那架飛機，由地面上是完全看不見的。</p>
<p>一九一八年，英國就造成一架很不錯的無聲機了。但是因爲機件過重致不適用。</p>
<p>總而言之，無論那一國有一架無聲機，他們的空車，就比隨便那一國的空軍前進十年了。有一位著名的老將曾說：　「你不能去打那種看不見的東西啊！」</p>

<h3>少年得意的威爾斯</h3>
<p>— 星朗</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福，爲希望獲得「無成見者」對歐洲大局的詳細情報起見，特派遺副國務卿威爾斯，以總統私人代表資格，赴歐考察現行局勢。現威氏已於本月十七日自紐約乘輸起程前往義國。</p>
<p>威爾斯於一八九二年十月十四日生於紐約城。十八歲時考進哈佛大學。畢業後一年，即就任駐日公使館秘書之職，可謂春風少年，發跡很早。在日二年即他調。一九二二年充任在華盛頓舉行的中美會議代表。一九二四年時，首决以總統私人代表資格，進行調解中美宏都拉斯共和國內部的革命，所以這次威氏的赴歐，是他生平第二次人工表總統私人，前往國外辦理外交事務，這賣是威氏僩人生命史上最値得紀念的二頁，眞可以和第一次歐洲大戰時，美國已故總統威爾遜派往歐洲訪問的私人代表好斯上校，先後媲美。同年，威氏</p>
<p>復被派充在宏都拉斯，亞馬巴拉城舉行的中美會議代表。威氏於一九三三年四月六日就任副國務卿之職，但不滿一月，於池月二十九日就被調充美國駐古巴的大使。復於當年十二月十五日調回美國，仍任副國務卿。威氏直到三十三歲時（一九二五年）始結婚，夫人湯式特小姐，爲華盛頓名媛。威氏屬美國民主黨，爲聖公會敎徒。著有「拿波斯的葡萄園」一書，一九二八年出版。</p>

<h3>小學教師的心</h3>
<p>— 王</p>
<p>不知道化了多少的週折，多少的麻煩，挨了多次的難堪，陪了多少次的笑臉，換來了一個「淸高」的小學敎師的職位。可是到現在，我却又後悔起來了。我後悔我爲什麼這樣容易被二十元一月的月薪所屈服了；我後悔我爲什麼這樣容易受一個半知不解的「校長」底驅使。幾個月來，一顆平穩的心，在我的胸膛裏，愈加振盪得發抖起來了。</p>
<p>但是環境不允許我這樣做：天眞的兒童鬧哄哄的要求我講述有趣的故事。他們閃着明亮的小眼，用最規矩的坐姿來表示他們歡迎。摒息住每一個人的鼻意，溫馥溶入在靜穆的空氣裏。我開始感到我留着這裏的需要。我不能走，我會對不起發十位可愛的兒童的－他們會給我最大的安慰，他們會補償我的痛苦。</p>
<p>道樣，我便按着鐘聲的指揮而工作着，我被留下來了。</p>
<p>可是，事情是會接踵而來的，當我有一天上完第一節國語的時候，在走廊裏被校長喚住了。他裝了滿臉虛僞的笑容來迎接我入他的房間。然後用具有深長世故的態度和語氣，說：</p>
<p>「對不起，×先生，以後在上課的時候，請你別對小孩子講什麼時事，而且，也不需要什麼課外讀物，因爲……然後他把雙手在週身摸素了一番之後，繼續說，「因爲，一　，家長也反對這一着，他們還寫了信來。……」</p>
<p>然而我不懂他的話，我站起來往外走，他跟出來，用響亮的聲音，在後面高叫：</p>
<p>「下次不許這樣！聽見唯？」</p>
<p>我沉着頭走下樓去，我熟悉這聲音是經理對商店小學徒的敎訓。我同時也感覺許多小學生向我投射一串懷疑的眼光</p>
<p>我的心開始又抖顫起來了　然而我担心着生活。我强烈的熱望着生活，它不允許我這樣輕易的拋葉我的職位。我知道不知有多少人日夜的在夢想着這半　職務。</p>
<p>雖然我頗安心的聽著鈴聲的指揮而工作着，但是我的心是一直抖顫着的。</p>

<h3>從塞外歸來　蒙古攝影回慰問電錄（上）</h3>
<p>— 姚士泉（重慶航訊）</p>
<p>這了攝製「西北皆輯」影片，「中國」派我隨軍訓部西北戰時巡迴敎育班到西北去，由渝出發先到陜西，再到寗夏，敎育班在寗夏之金積縣開始工作，我們攝影隊即往蒙古地之阿拉善去，事前已與各方接洽就緒，所以工作開展還算順利。同行的一共四人。</p>
<p>第一天到吳忠堡，第二天到寗夏。度了幾天荒落的沙漠，在第六天才到定遠營。不巧正刮大風，灰沙彌漫　了整個天地，在飛沙走石中，進了一家小客店，風要休息，阿拉善霍碩特物蒙古政府特地派了人員來迎接我們了。搶着我們的行李送入了像招待所一般的永盛號，殷勤地招待使我們覺着十分地內心不安。第二天的早晨我們即去拜訪旗政府，達王還在蘭州，由大協理羅恩凱巴圖接見。他能講很流利的國語，所以我們談得很愉快。席間大協理有誠摯的演說：「希望中央能瞭解蒙古同胞的智識落後，對抗戰還沒有盡過很大的力量。但是愛國不能後人，當一致　護抗戰國策，在蔣委員長領導下，各民族精誠團結！抗戰到底！把日本人趕出口國去……」</p>
<p>寗夏省政府駐定遠營辦事處的張主任。常常陪我們到各處去參觀，如喇嘛廟，蒙藏委員會，圖書館，蒙藏學校等……我們準備了兩天攝影工作，都已承蒙旗政府準備就緒。並派來蒙古繙譯，及帮同工作人員三人，我們共計七人帶了乾糧騎上駱駝，深入「阿拉善」大沙漠去我尋我們的攝影材料。</p>
<p>騎了三天一步一擺的駱駝，住了三夜沙漠中爬滿了四腳蛇的逢賬，才到達「河屯鹽池」本來想到「吉蘭泰」去，因為這時還沒開工「河屯池」的面積週圍二十華里，產鹽很豐富，可惜交通阻塞未能大量開樣，去二十名，該地現已睡為國有，運輸不便，產量已有過剩，所以工人不能得到每天應有的工作，生活十分痛苦，我們在此工作了兩天……</p>
<p>同來的蒙古同志很喜觀喝酒，我們也略飲一點，一路上因為得了許多帮助，如騎駱駝到十里外去。找水，每天燒飯搭蓬賬，還要唱蒙古歌給我們聽，大家都顯得很親密。臨別「河屯池」的晚上，在坑上無形中像開了個夜會，大家愉快的談到很晚，我們找出許多日用品分給三位蒙古同胞，他們見了這許多日用品都很快樂，很驚奇。</p>

<p>鯨魚跟踪追來</p>
<p>他們拼命划着逃着可是給惱怒的鯨魚看見了，他追上來一下子把他們的木筏打得粉碎。却幸而他們都陸續給潮水打上了岸，甚至蟋蟀吉密耐也重遇見了他們。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Fleeing From Yongning Westward to Founan Are Ambushed by Chinese Forces and Retreat to Longtou; Chinese Forces Advance on Three Routes (East, West, and North) and Recover High Ground in the Xiaodong and Datang Area of Nanning</h3>
<p>Guilin, 21st (Evening): Japanese troops who invaded Founan County were ambushed by Chinese forces and mostly retreated to Longtou. Chinese forces are in pursuit. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou, 21st: Approximately 2,000 Japanese troops who advanced westward from Nanning, by the evening of the 22nd, a portion had reached the vicinity of Quli (west of Founan County). Upon seeing the Japanese committed to the area, Chinese forces immediately mobilized on multiple routes, determined to meet them head-on and intercept them. A small-scale annihilation battle west of Yongning is about to unfold again. High ground in the Xiaodong and Datang area was recovered by Chinese forces on the 21st. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here today from the Chinese side, Japanese troops in the Nanning area abruptly moved westward along the highway on February 21st. One route of Japanese troops stationed at Longtou, west of Nanning, advanced towards Founan, on the south bank of the Yu River, on February 21st. Chinese forces met them in engagement. The Japanese motivation is not yet clear, and it may only be a diversionary tactic, as Chinese forces are now approaching Nanning from the east, west, and north. However, the Japanese westward advance from Nanning may be an attempt to cut off westward highway traffic. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Multiple Japanese aircraft attacked Liuzhou in batches from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM today. They were met with fierce anti-aircraft fire from Chinese defense forces and did not dare linger long over the city, blindly dropping over a hundred bombs in the suburbs. There were no losses on the Chinese side. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guinan Front: Chinese forces on the Yongwu Road continue to advance against the Japanese, recovering Dasha Mountain near Gaofeng Pass on the 21st. The vanguard reached Shiling near Santang (north of Nanmi). Another unit arrived at Xianbi Village. On the Yongbin Road, Chinese and Japanese forces are facing off in the Guliuling and Hejiangxu area. Chinese forces are currently advancing against the Japanese. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces Northeast of Guangshui Capture Daxindian</h3>
<p>Fancheng: Japanese troops in Daxindian, northeast of Guangshui, advanced towards the Dabie Mountains on the 18th and were met with a fierce head-on attack by Chinese forces. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and Chinese forces recaptured Daxindian. The Japanese retreated to the Wanyuan Garden and Jiangjiawan area northeast of Guangshui. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Japanese troops in the Liujia Yandi and Lanmaqiang area have been completely routed by Chinese forces. Sanyangdian is still under siege by Chinese forces. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Account of Chinese Army Victory in Northern Hubei</p>
<p>Fancheng: Since the 18th, Chinese forces in northern Hubei have been sweeping Japanese forces entrenched in various strongholds at the northeast foot of the Dahong Mountains, repeatedly capturing key passes. The account of the battle is briefly described as follows: Many of the points occupied by the Japanese at the northeast foot of the Dahong Mountains are mountainous areas. Through constant Chinese attacks, they have been extremely exhausted, morale is scattered, and soldiers lack fighting spirit. At noon on the 18th, after Chinese forces recovered Pingba, an important stronghold between Anzhong and Anjing, they took advantage of their victory to besiege Sanyangdian, cut off Japanese communications, and pursued towards Anlu, with unstoppable momentum. The Japanese were terrified. At 8:00 PM on the 18th, Chinese forces further attacked Luoyangdian, northeast of Pingba and northwest of Anlu, annihilating the Japanese forces at Fugong Mountain and Zushi Ridge nearby. When the Japanese in Luoyangdian were on the verge of collapse, they released poison gas to obstruct the Chinese advance. The Chinese then detoured with another unit to the southeast of Luoyangdian, fighting fiercely all night. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. At 6:00 AM on the 19th, the area was finally recovered. The Chinese immediately advanced to Dushan, on the west side of Maping, and fought the Japanese until 11:30 AM, again recovering Dushan, Maping, and Anlu. The Japanese were extremely alarmed and attempted to resist stubbornly. The Chinese forces then crossed the river with one unit for a surprise attack, recovering Pinglin and cutting off the highway, and are currently expanding towards Anmakou. Chinese forces near the suburbs of Suixian also launched fierce attacks on the Japanese at Donggaomiao, Dubengshan, and Leidudun from the 19th, and the Japanese situation is showing signs of wavering. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Major General Akiyama Dies in Battle in Shandong</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Shandong: On the 13th of last month, during the Chinese forces' siege of Zhuwangzhuang, Akiyama Seitaro, the commander of the Japanese Independent Mixed Brigade, led his troops in stubborn resistance. Chinese forces used overwhelming force to annihilate the stubborn Japanese, and the Japanese suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties. Akiyama was shot in the chest, and his horse was also killed. According to reliable reports, Akiyama died of his wounds on the 23rd of the same month after being transferred to Fangzi for medical treatment. Local Japanese troops all wore black gauze on their arms to express their grief. Akiyama was a graduate of the 27th class of the Japanese Military Academy and held the rank of Major General, having served as commander of regiments, brigades, and commander of the Nagasaki Fortress. He was a mainstay of the young and middle-aged faction in the Japanese army. Since the outbreak of the incident, he led troops to invade southern Shandong, and now his death at the hands of Chinese soldiers has dealt a great blow to the Japanese army. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Remnants of Japanese Forces Around Wuyuan Eliminated; Chinese Forces Advance on Baotou</h3>
<p>Linhe: For days, Chinese forces have been ambushing retreating Japanese forces from various directions, including Linhe and Wuyuan, in the southern foothills of the Ula Mountains and the eastern section of the Baowu Highway, inflicting many casualties. A remnant of the Japanese force was intercepted by the Chinese, unable to escape, and retreated into the city of Wuyuan yesterday and today. Another group simultaneously fled back to Wubu, attempting to hold out and wait for reinforcements. At this point, the Japanese outside Wuyuan and Wuzhen have been eliminated. Chinese forces are currently pursuing the remnants of the Japanese forces towards Baotou. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lanzhou: Chinese forces are currently fiercely attacking Wuyuan from the east, west, and south. At the same time, a certain unit of Chinese forces has advanced towards Wuyuan from the north and will soon complete the encirclement. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lanzhou: A certain unit of Chinese forces reached Yichang Getan, on the southern outskirts of Wuyuan, on the 18th, only a little over ten li from Wuyuan. They have engaged in bayonet combat with the Japanese for days, repeatedly advancing into and out of Yichang Getan, and the fighting is extraordinarily fierce. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lanzhou: A certain unit of Chinese forces crossed the river from a certain location and attacked the Japanese forces at Xishanzui (east of Wuyuan). On the 18th and 19th, they annihilated over 300 Japanese soldiers. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Drop Poison Bombs in Western Suiyuan</p>
<p>Linhe: At 12:00 PM on the 16th of this month, nine Japanese planes from western Suiyuan flew over Linhe Shanba to the vicinity of Yangcun and dropped over forty tear gas bombs. There were no Chinese soldiers in the area, and only over twenty women and children were poisoned. At the same time, six Japanese planes dropped over thirty poison bombs near Linhe, and over ten Chinese civilians were poisoned but have since been cured. At around 10:00 AM on the 17th, nine Japanese planes returned to Linhe and dropped over twenty poison bombs, but due to the effective Chinese defenses, only one elderly woman suffered a minor poisoning. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Xiaxian, Southern Shanxi, are Caught in a Two-Pronged Attack by Chinese Forces; Japanese Suffer Hundreds of Casualties and Rout. Frequent Movements of Japanese Troops in Southeastern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Tongguan: On the 17th, a portion of Japanese troops from Jiangxian raided Jiho to the north but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese. The Japanese, suffering heavy casualties, retreated in disarray. Furthermore, on the evening of the 21st, over four thousand Japanese troops from Xiaxian advanced from Miaocun towards Fujiaxie. They were intercepted by Chinese forces, and fierce fighting broke out, repeatedly blunting the Japanese advance. When the Japanese troops attempted to resist stubbornly, Chinese forces used a unit to contain them from the front and another unit to outflank them from the rear, launching a two-pronged attack, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. By midnight, the remnants of the Japanese force were unable to withstand the attack and fled in disorder. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Daily Necessities in Progress</h3>
<p>Coal briquettes sold at a fixed price, flour at a regulated price, foreign rice and beef tallow, life can be slightly reduced panic. However, the general public is still worried, as if suffering is deep, and hardship is great; this is originally due to the difficulty of calming down after panic, or due to the fact that things are done by force, and the name and reality cannot be fully consistent. There are also those who see that if the environment does not change, no matter how hard the human governance methods are used, it will be easily destroyed. Talking only about rice and grain, Changshu rice has long disappeared in Shanghai; recently, the search has been more thorough, and the rice from Jiangsu, Tong, and Qingjiao is also being taken away in bundles, and how much Du rice can be transferred from Hongkou to the concession area is not only little but almost completely disappeared. Not only the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu province but also the rice price in Hebei, Tianjin, and other places is as high as 120 yuan, and flour is as high as 21 yuan. Although it is the inevitable result of the vicious expansion of the "United Reserve Bank's fake banknotes" presided over by the Japanese, it is said that most of the rice is controlled and purchased by the Japanese side and transported back to their country for consumption; in the past, grain from the Northeast could also be transported into the customs for relief, but recently it is also subject to the control of the Japanese Kwantung Army and is not allowed to be transported out. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the disaster in Lu will not end, which is also an unprecedented adversity for Chinese people's food.</p>
<p>However, there are many city foxes and shrine rats in Shanghai's food supply, relying on mischief, and foreign rice arrives in Shanghai almost every day, in large numbers, and there is so much rice stored that it is no longer compatible. There are many temporary sheds built, with thousands of warehouses, but the rice price is still soaring. A few days ago, Saigon No. 1 foreign rice was priced as high as 51 to 2 yuan (per city stone), and the secret market price was more than 50 yuan. The price of Xiang rice is close to 60 yuan. But no matter its flour or coal briquettes, once the price is fixed, the market will immediately calm down. If the rice industry maintains people's livelihood with empty words and practices industry regulations, judging from the facts, except for temporarily pretending to meet the environment, the old habits will relapse as before; dark market prices will emerge endlessly, and they turn a deaf ear and turn a blind eye. Foreign rice is not restricted, but they do not know that manipulating foreign rice is the way to manipulate other rice grains; raising the price of foreign rice is also the way to promote the rise in prices of daily necessities. The price limit was originally intended to alleviate the urgent need for a time, but as for the long-term plan, the way to equalize prices, how can the price limit be effective, not to mention what is urgent today is hoarding and unequal distribution. Speculation and manipulation cannot be sanctioned! Hoarding and speculation are aimed at huge profits. If their desires are not satisfied, they will ignore the hungry people on the road, even if there is red millet in the warehouse. Unequal distribution means that those with power and money do not have to worry about food, and those who rely on their labor often cannot get a liter of rice. Even if selling at reduced prices is done immediately, what is seen is still too little porridge for too many monks. Non-"long-handed people" cannot get it even if they stand on tiptoe all day or run several times. However, it is not easy to achieve even distribution, and it is not easy to achieve results without a detailed survey of the poor population, dividing the area, distributing it evenly, and maintaining order. Today, it often takes a day's work to consume a few buckets of rice and a bag of calcium, and it is still not possible. Moreover, for undertakings related to social welfare, there is a lack of statistics in peacetime, and there is no preparation in case of emergency, so how can we not give people a chance to take advantage of the situation!</p>
<p>The arduous responsibilities and current difficulties cannot be resolved for a while, and the suffering of the majority of citizens cannot be ignored. Therefore, for the daily necessities such as rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, oil, beans, calcium powder, and even vegetables, fruits, and melons, it seems that a committee should be jointly formed by fair and promising members of each industry, and representatives of public groups should be invited to actually handle the investigation, sales, inventory, and adjustment matters, and then seek the uniformity of distribution, the leveling of prices, and the adjustment of the market. Each industry has its own organization, which cannot be fully understood by outsiders, so it is necessary to bring all industries together, cooperate in the division of labor, and then things will be easier. The disadvantage of past meetings is that they can talk but cannot act. After the meeting, it is over. How is the execution is not asked, so there is little achievement. If we are really thinking about the people's food during the war, then those who serve as members must have the spirit of serving the public, be familiar with the content of each industry, develop fair and easy-to-handle policies, and take into account both the people's livelihood and business conditions. And in all industries, we should also think for the sake of the public and eliminate the practice of speculation and manipulation so that prices return to stability. Stable prices benefit not only consumers but also industry and commerce. The reason why prices are unstable today is not only due to the impact of legal currency value, let alone the legal exchange rate of legal currency. In the Shanghai black market, without speculators wanting to manipulate all things and also manipulate foreign exchange gold, and without the devaluation of "United Reserve Bank's fake banknotes", the north would not exchange legal currency for "United Reserve Bank's fake banknotes" to exchange foreign exchange gold, and the exchange rate would never change. It is also not based on insufficient production; it is entirely caused by improper military and financial power. Those created by human power should be quelled by human power. If human power is not good, what can you blame heaven for? If the public can solve the suffering in their lives, they can only do their best to save the situation!</p>

However, the Red Army finally crushed their enemies, and all evil forces were completely eliminated." Finally, he said: "China is fighting for national independence and human justice, and it has been three years. During this period, your advisors and instructors have made great contributions to us. This friendship and concern is worthy of our admiration. Today we celebrate this anniversary, and at the same time, we hope that the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese Revolutionary Army, just like two brothers fighting for world peace, will permanently maintain this precious friendship, permanently join hands to advance towards the bright road, and work together for world human peace." Then they ate and drank together and enjoyed their time together. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces Encircle Remnants of Japanese Troops in Xiaoshan</h3>

The remnants of the Japanese troops on the west bank of the Puyang River have been eliminated. After capturing Linpu, the Chinese forces advanced victoriously towards Xiaoshan. The remnants of the Japanese troops in that area are in a very embarrassing situation and can be easily defeated in one go. The Japanese attempt to expand the periphery of Xiaoshan has come to an end, and the remnants of the Japanese troops trapped in Xiaoshan are like turtles in a jar, isolated and weak, and unable to do anything.

<h3>Northeastern Guerrilla Forces Are Strong</h3>
<p>——According to the Soviet Report</p>
<p>Chongqing: A long article on guerrilla warfare in various provinces of Northeast China was published in the Moscow Labor Daily, stating that the continuous attacks of guerrilla forces throughout the Northeast have demoralized the Japanese army. It is not uncommon for Japanese soldiers to join the guerrilla forces. Although the militarism practiced by Japan in the Northeast has created a wave of terror, the national decentralization movement has become more widespread, and the strength of the guerrilla forces has become more enormous. The Japanese army's "mopping up the rear" work has repeatedly met with the resolute resistance of the guerrilla forces and has failed. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Yonai Admits the China War is Still Difficult to Resolve; Pays Attention to the Attitude of Third Countries Toward Japan's Policies in China; Rumor is Tokyo Will Announce the Terms of the Japan-Wang Agreement</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Yonai admitted today in the House of Peers that the China Incident cannot be resolved in the short term. Therefore, Japan must strengthen its national defense and cultivate its economic resources. The establishment of a new "Central Government" with Wang Jingwei at its core is only the first step on the path to resolving the China Incident. In addition, Japan must pay attention to the attitude of first-rate countries towards Japan's policies in China. At the same time, unless the Chongqing National Government voluntarily abandons its anti-Japanese and pro-Communist policies and joins Japan's movement to establish a "New Order in East Asia," it will still have to resort to military force. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A Tokyo foreign dispatch stated that during yesterday's House of Representatives debate on the budget案, Diet member Aburatani of the Jijoku Doshikai (Current Affairs Comrades Association) argued that the supply of raw materials in next year's materials mobilization plan should not be completely dependent on the United States, but should instead be imported from various parts of the South Seas. Diet member Maba pointed out that the resolution of the "China Incident" has been obstructed by third countries, which is similar to other countries' intervention in the Russo-Japanese War of 1894. Maba advocated further replenishing armaments to prevent interference from various countries. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It is rumored that after the "New Central Political Council," the core of China's "new regime," held a meeting, the basic conditions of the agreement between Wang Jingwei and the Japanese authorities in China, which were agreed upon last December and approved by the Abe Cabinet at the beginning of this year, will be announced soon. The Japan Times summarized these conditions as follows: (1) Japan's policy towards the "New Central Government" is to give it full support and provide all possible assistance in economic, military, and cultural aspects to enable it to complete the unification of China. The Japanese government firmly believes that this "New Government" will have the qualifications and strength to cooperate with Japan in building a "New Order in East Asia." (2) When the "New Central Government" reaches a stage where it can be regarded as capable of completing the task of unifying China, Japan will be the first to officially recognize the "New Central Government," adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and make efforts to persuade other countries to recognize it. (3) The Japanese government believes that if the "New Government" inherits the old Kuomintang government and uses the Three Principles of the People as its guiding ideology, it will not harm the establishment of the "New Order in East Asia," as long as this "New Government" does not inherit the anti-Japanese and pro-Communist policies of the old Kuomintang government. The Japanese government is determined to lead the "New Central Government" with the utmost caution so that the "New Central Government" does not repeat the mistakes of the Chongqing government. (4) The two Japanese-funded national companies, the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company, will absolutely not change their legal status as Japanese semi-official companies even after the establishment of the "New Central Government." (5) The "New Central Government" will seek to unify the Chinese monetary system and establish a "New Central Bank." The Japanese government believes that the "New Central Government," in view of the special mission of the "Federal Reserve" Bank, will not absorb that bank. (6) The Japanese government does not intend to change the parity between the Japanese yen and the "Federal Reserve" notes at this time. (7) The Japanese government will take a cautious attitude towards the legal tender of the Chongqing government to avoid any drastic changes in the economic life of the Chinese people. (8) The Japanese government is determined to make the "substantial" conditions for Japan's peace with China fully clear to the Chinese people. These conditions are based on the so-called three principles in the Konoe Declaration issued in December 1938: joint anti-communism, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and Japan's no demand for territory or indemnity. (9) The Chongqing government is moving towards decline due to the intensification of the KMT-CCP friction produced by the powerful pro-peace faction, the insecurity of the legal tender's future, the shortage of raw materials, and the reduction of tariff revenue. The strength of the Chinese army has weakened, and the fighting power of a Chinese division is only equivalent to a large Japanese battalion. (10) The Japanese government believes that the Chongqing government will decline or dissolve naturally due to the sound development of the "New Central Government" and the pressure of the military operations of the Japanese army in China, and its constituent members will join Wang Jingwei's "New Central Government." (11) If the Chiang Kai-shek regime does not re-consider its dangerous situation and dissolve itself for a long time, Japan's policy of "not negotiating with Chiang Kai-shek" will never change. (12) When the Chongqing government reconsiders and makes peace with Japan or participates in the Wang Jingwei government, Japan will no longer need to station a large army in China. The Japanese government will consider the China Incident to be over when order is restored in China. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The US and the Netherlands Build Giant Warships, Japan is Extremely Worried; Arita Plans to Continue Negotiations with the US Ambassador to Adjust Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the US government's decision to build a 45,000-ton cruiser, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy commented that it was the beginning of an arms race, and Japan was extremely worried about the consequences of this move. At the same time, Japan was also deeply troubled by the Dutch government's decision to build three 26,500-ton cruisers to protect the neutrality of the Dutch East Indies, believing that such large warships were unnecessary for protecting neutrality. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, Foreign Minister Arita is planning to continue negotiations with US Ambassador to Japan Grew to adjust Japanese-US relations. However, the spokesman did not specify the date for the resumption of negotiations. According to the Kyoto Shimbun, when negotiations resume, the Foreign Minister will explain Japan's position in China, and the opening of the Yangtze River will not be urgent, because Japan has not used the opening of the Yangtze River as a bargaining chip. It was also stated that although Japan hopes to conclude a trade agreement with the United States, the "New Order in East Asia" will continue to be established, regardless of whether an agreement is signed or not. At the same time, in order to avoid dependence on the United States for raw materials, raw materials should be obtained from other sources, such as South American countries, South Sea countries, and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Saito Delivers a Speech, Close Abdomen Does Not Resign, Regrets That Japan Has No True Politicians, Vows to Do His Best to Uphold Parliamentary Politics</h3>
<p>Tokyo: House of Representatives member Saito Takao, who was criticized by the military for making inappropriate remarks after delivering a speech in the House of Representatives on the 2nd of this month and was asked to be disciplined, recently made a statement to a reporter from the Hochi Shimbun, saying, "Since I delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, people across the country have called me a traitor to the country, but I really don't understand when I made remarks that harmed the country. The authorities keep everything secret, which is the crux of the problem. I delivered the speech because I was worried and angry about national affairs. Now I am still willing to stand on the podium and make a statement to the people across the country. The speech I am about to deliver in the House of Representatives' Disciplinary Committee tomorrow should also be made known to the people of the country. If this is the case, all problems can be solved easily. On the contrary, if anything is not made public and the people are ignorant, is the politics of a civilized country really like this? The speech I gave to the House of Representatives before was precisely to give the government authorities an opportunity to explain to the world the true goals of the 'China Incident.' At that time, if Prime Minister Yonai thought I was wrong, he should have stood up and corrected me, saying, 'Mr. Saito, the goal of the China Incident is such and such, so the way to solve it must be such and such.' If that were the case, all doubts would have been dispelled, but Prime Minister Yonai did not offer any explanation to convince people. Why is that? It is difficult to understand. That day, Prime Minister Yonai listened to my speech without saying a word, and only criticized me the next day. Isn't that strange? I dare to swear to God that I firmly believe that what I have done is completely justified. The members of both houses are pitiful insects, incited by certain parties. Those who advocate disciplining me are both pitiful and laughable. What a pity that in this day and age, there is not a single true politician in Japan! I have given 'bomb speeches' many times in my life, but I have never been reprimanded. I will definitely not resign from my position as a Diet member. Even if I have committed a serious crime and must resign, I will only commit seppuku. At this moment, I am still healthy and probably have ten years of life left. As long as I have a breath left, I vow to do my best to uphold parliamentary politics." (Havas Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: In the financial speech at the plenary session of the House of Peers, Sakurai also proposed as an additional budget the unavoidable expenses beyond the general budget, hoping to gain support. The above additional budget案 is only the necessary expenses for increasing the production of important materials such as coal, gold, charcoal, fertilizer, matches, etc., and family subsidies. It is considered an urgent expense for expanding the current production capacity and ensuring the people's livelihood. The total amount requested is expected to be around 300 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance is carefully reviewing it from a financial point of view and expects to submit it to the Diet around the beginning of March. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Regarding the Inspection of US Mail, the US Lodges Representations with the UK, Heated Debate Occurs in the US Senate, Recognizing the UK's Action as Coercive</h3>
<p>Washington: A Pan American Airways clipper mail plane, which passed through Bermuda, a British territory in the Atlantic Ocean, on the 18th of last month, was inspected. It was rumored that the British authorities used force at the time to force the plane to hand over the mail, but the report submitted by the company to the State Department did not mention this. Regarding this matter, responsible officials here recently stated that the State Department has lodged representations with the British government, and both sides are conducting talks through diplomatic channels. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Several senators made statements last night strongly criticizing Britain's insistence on inspecting US mail in Bermuda, a British colony in the West Indies, because they received news that British armed sailors in Bermuda had boarded the clipper ship or US mail plane and forcibly seized the mail for inspection. Although Bermuda officials have recently stated that this news is completely false, Democratic Senator Clark has obtained unanimous consent from the Senate to have the news reported in the Senate record. Clark said that the British move was a coercive act, which only strengthened his view of prohibiting US planes from landing in Bermuda. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said that Britain, as a belligerent, undoubtedly has the right to inspect the mail on clipper-style US aircraft to prevent contraband, but its exercise of this right is too excessive and extremely ignorant. Democrat Truman suggested that US aircraft should no longer land in Bermuda, and British aircraft should not be allowed to land in the United States. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>New York: It was learned here last night that British Marines seized 2,600 pounds of US mail from a US clipper ship in Bermuda on January 18, threatening with bayonets. Pacific Airways has yesterday transferred the entire issue of British inspection of US mail in Bermuda to the State Department for handling. The company authorities stated that they have no right to discuss this matter. According to information obtained by a Havas Agency reporter, US clipper ship captain Robert refused an official's inspection of US mail and told the inspectors to leave the clipper ship. After a heated debate between the two sides, the inspectors summoned the Marines on a nearby steamer, who boarded the clipper ship with bayonets. Although Robert allowed the official to seize the mail, he demanded that the British side issue a receipt. He also wrote a protest and handed it to the British consul. News from Bermuda claimed that the British inspection director, Lieutenant Colonel O'Dwyer, denounced the reported news as "completely absurd." He said, "The British side requested Robert to hand over the mail, which was presented by an unarmed British officer ashore. There were no armed personnel nearby at the time. Robert's filing of a formal protest was his duty. Afterwards, Robert did not prevent the inspectors from acting. The inspectors waited until Robert had put the protest in writing before boarding the clipper ship." O'Dwyer continued that the relationship between inspectors on Bermuda and Pacific Airways has always been "most harmonious." (Havas Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Honorary President of New York's Schenectady University Appoints Ambassador Hu Shih</h3>

<h3>British Fleet Discovered off the Coast of Northern Finland; British-Soviet Relations Suddenly Become Tense; Soviet Ships in the Arctic Ocean on High Alert; Will Repel British Ships if They Enter Soviet Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Stockholm, according to a report in "Aftonbladet" quoting Moscow sources, the Soviet Naval People's Commissar Kuznetsov flew to Murmansk yesterday to inspect the Soviet Navy's Arctic Ocean Fleet in preparation for repelling British warships if they enter Soviet territorial waters. Moscow political figures have stated that they will not tolerate British obstruction of German-Soviet trade. The United Kingdom has dispatched naval forces to the Arctic Ocean in an attempt to blockade the Norwegian coast. If British ships enter Soviet territorial waters, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly go to war with Britain. Soviet officials are hoping for an early end to the Finnish war in order to avoid intervention by Western European countries. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A Moscow dispatch from a Swedish newspaper stated that a British fleet suddenly appeared near Petsamo on the Arctic coast, causing great tension in the Far North, and incidents may occur at any time. Moscow is very uneasy about the British action. The entire Arctic Ocean Fleet of the Soviet Union is prepared to respond. According to Moscow sources, if the British fleet does not enter Soviet territorial waters, the Soviet government does not want to take any action against Britain, but if British ships actually enter Soviet territorial waters, the Soviet Navy will immediately go to war with them. At the same time, if British ships sink Soviet merchant ships, conflicts will be inevitable. However, the general public believes that British ships may not take any hostile actions against the Soviet Union. The purpose of British ships is probably to obstruct trade between Germany and the Soviet Union through Murmansk. According to a US newspaper on February 20, several British cruisers appeared near Petsamo. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Navy Active in Norwegian Waters, Berlin Feels Anxious, Prepares to Act Preemptively</h3>
<p>Zurich: According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Berlin is very worried about the news of British naval activity in the northern seas, because British naval forces are appearing more and more frequently in Norwegian waters, and there is great fear that Britain may launch a major offensive from northern Europe. Therefore, the German authorities are now trying to impress upon the public that they do not want to waste any time in launching a major offensive against Britain before the British navy and air force launch such an attack. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd) The Berlin correspondent of the Copenhagen National Daily stated today that German political attention is now focused on the northern countries. The German side claims to have obtained concrete evidence that London and Paris are planning to blockade traffic between Germany and Norwegian territorial waters in order to prevent Swedish iron ore from being transported to Germany. The British and French are also planning to defeat Germany on the Finnish battlefield. The German side is constantly warning Scandinavian countries to resist any actions that attack their neutrality.

<h3>Soviet Black Sea Fleet Completes Exercise, Sails Back to Base</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to a report from Sevastopol, Crimea, the Soviet fleet has returned to its original base after recently holding a large-scale exercise in the Black Sea. According to naval officials, the exercise was "extremely satisfactory." (Havas Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Attempts to Incite Unrest in the Near East, Many German Officers Disguised and Travel to Romania</h3>
<p>London: Reuters learned from reliable sources that many German officers have recently gone to Romania with the aim of inciting unrest in the Near East. It is reported that these people served in the Near East during the last war. This time, they are using false names and disguised as merchants. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The "Altmark" Case, Norway's Situation Difficult, Nordic Countries Meeting Today, London and Berlin Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>Paris: Regarding the German ship "Altmark" case, diplomatic circles here recently stated that the British government sent a note to the Norwegian government, requesting that it be detained and its crew confined. The Norwegian government has not yet responded, and Foreign Minister Guten's speech in the House of Representatives the other day cannot be considered an official response. Now the foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are scheduled to hold a meeting in Copenhagen on the 24th of this month, when this case will definitely be discussed. It is reported that they will support the German viewpoint. The fact is that these countries are in a delicate situation because their military strength is weak and insufficient to resist the threat of Germany and the Soviet Union. However, their current policies show signs of abandoning true neutrality and leaning towards one side of the belligerents, which cannot be accepted by Britain and France. As far as Norway is concerned, it is no longer able to exercise its functions in its territorial waters. Britain and France agree on this point. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the meeting of the northern European countries Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in Copenhagen tomorrow, Berlin political figures are paying close attention. First, how the northern European countries will act after the "Cossack" incident is of great concern to Germany. Secondly, the Allies have repeatedly tried to involve Norway and Sweden in the war. Therefore, Berlin officials predict that the Copenhagen meeting will determine the common attitude of the northern European countries. The "Hamburg Daily" believes that if the northern European countries want to avoid being involved in the Finnish issue, they may have a tendency to withdraw from the League of Nations. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the German ship "Altmark" case, political figures here recently stated that the reason why the Norwegian government has delayed responding after the government sent a note to Norway is that it cannot find sufficient arguments to convince the British international law experts. According to unconfirmed news, the Norwegian authorities have released the ship, which is not impossible. However, it should be noted that if the country does this, a friendly solution to the dispute between Britain and Norway will inevitably be extremely difficult. Now British legal experts are meticulously studying appropriate measures to prevent Germany from arbitrarily using Norwegian territorial waters, and at the same time, to study what kind of method should be used by British warships when conducting inspections in Norwegian waters so that it does not contradict the principles of international law. After this method is implemented in the future, if it can be proven to be practical, its scope should be expanded. In other words, this inspection method will also be applied to other routes through which German supplies pass, especially the Black Sea route. The reason is that a batch of Soviet kerosene has reportedly been shipped from the Black Sea to Constanta, Romania, waiting for the Danube River to thaw and resume navigation, and will then be transported to Germany by waterway. In short, there is no doubt that the British Ministry of Economic Warfare will take appropriate measures to inspect trade in the Black Sea. As for how British policy towards the Soviet Union will evolve in the future, it will depend on the quantity of various goods supplied by the Soviet Union to Germany in accordance with the German-Soviet economic agreement.

<h3>London City Hall Hosts Banquet for British Naval Officers and Sailors, Naval Minister Churchill Attends and Delivers Speech, Celebrating Glorious Naval Battle in South American Waters</h3>
<p>London - The crew members of the British cruisers "Ajax" and "Exeter," which fought against the German ship "Spee" in South American waters, arrived at Waterloo Station today. The scale of the public welcome was comparable to the coronation of the British King. The crew consisted of more than six hundred men, arriving by train from Davenport. A small squad of crew members who had arrived in London earlier greeted them at the station. The bands of the two ships were arranged on both sides of the platform. After the train arrived, the music played loudly. After the crew members disembarked, all seven hundred and sixty men, led by the band, marched in formation to the City Hall to attend a luncheon hosted by the Lord Mayor of London and the city council. The streets were lined with flags, and the cheers of the public almost drowned out the music. Numerous extra police officers were stationed outside Waterloo Station to maintain order. The crowd was mostly composed of schoolchildren, along with many British and Canadian soldiers mixed in. After the crew members arrived at the City Hall, they filed into the famous Grand Banquet Hall, initially appearing cramped, but soon returned to normal and chatted casually in the hall. Captains Bell and Huthouse of the two ships sat to the left and right of the Lord Mayor. Naval Minister Churchill, Lord Privy Seal Hall, Air Minister Woot, Minister for Coordination of Defense Garfield, and Minister without Portfolio Hankey were also present nearby. When the Lord Mayor raised his glass to toast, he mentioned the bravery, skill, and seafarer spirit demonstrated in the battle, saying it deserved a glorious place in naval history. "We have heard that the enemy will manufacture new machines of destruction, but there is one thing the enemy cannot manufacture, that is, children of good stock, some of whom are being treated with courtesy by us today." Later, Captain Huthouse gave a modest speech, saying that they met the Spee on the clear morning on the high seas, causing the rest of the navy to envy their opportunity. The audience cheered loudly. Churchill delivered a speech, saying that the unity of the navy and the nation, or the unity of the navy and the merchant fleet, has never been as solid as it is today. The important task of the war has been added to the shoulders of sailors and the Royal Air Force coastal defense comrades. Those who have sacrificed themselves in arduous and cruel struggles have numbered three thousand. The glorious naval battle we are celebrating today has brought spring to the hearts of the British people in the bleak winter. The number of various warships now totals one thousand seven hundred, and is still increasing. Now, all are comforted and excited. This is the approval that the people of London should express for the methods that the Navy has implemented and will implement, so that the goods on which the survival of the nation depends, and the noble aspirations they hold, can be safely achieved. The Admiralty and the fleet are now jointly experiencing the special nature of this war, although there is a danger of mistakes, unfortunate incidents, and tragedies sometimes occurring, but the government hopes that the decisiveness and design awareness felt at the center can be transmitted to the entire navy, reducing the burden of their tasks. The glorious battle on the South American sea added a tail last week, that is, the destroyer Cossack rescued captured British compatriots from the triviality of partial neutrality under the enemy's armpit. This proves that the long arm of British naval power is not only extended to our enemies, but also to our close friends. Nelson's immortal saying, "England expects that every man will do his duty," can now be added with one sentence: "The Navy is here." (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>London - The crew members of the British cruisers "Ajax" and "Exeter," who made meritorious contributions in the battle with the German ship Spee at the mouth of the River Plate in South America, were awarded medals by the King of England at the Horse Guards Parade today. Thousands of people watched. Every time an officer or soldier received a medal, the audience cheered loudly in celebration. The last person to receive the medal was the widow of the late Marine Corps member of the Exeter, Russell. Russell had both arms blown off and died in battle. The families of those who died in the decisive battle were provided with special seats. The King and Queen personally went to that area after the medal ceremony and talked with the families. When the crew members left in formation after the ceremony, the traffic in central London was disrupted for a long time due to the excessive crowding of the welcoming crowd.

<h3>Espionage Activities Within Belgian, Dutch, and Swedish Territories</h3>
<p>London - Spies are densely distributed within the territories of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The police are busy searching the homes of those whose behavior is suspicious. It is reported that the Dutch police have detected that espionage agencies have extensively planted partisans in several places in the Netherlands, and have now arrested six people, including a German who was arrested in the Groningen area in the north. After two foreign soldiers attempted to escape from the reception center, the police launched an investigation, which is still underway. Last night, the police in Belgium arrested a German employed by the Anzhou Erde Consulate, as well as a shipping agent from Ghent and his sister, all on suspicion of espionage. In the Swedish capital, a spy case was tried. The five defendants were found to have sought maritime intelligence in Swedish ports and supplied it to a foreign country. The court ruled that their activities were sufficient to endanger the good relations between Sweden and other countries, and sentenced them to imprisonment for eight months to one year. One of the defendants, an Englishman, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. (Reuter's telegram on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Circumstances of the Plebiscite in Upper Silesia - Official Announcement Published by Berlin - Recalling British and French Incitement of Anti-German Riots</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German government today issued the fourth official announcement, recalling the attitude adopted by the former Polish government during the plebiscite in Upper Silesia from 1919 to 1920, and the circumstances under which the Polish nation abused the German minority. The preamble explains that according to the Treaty of Versailles, a plebiscite should be held in Upper Silesia to determine the future nationality of the rich industrial area. However, since 1919, Poland has used various methods to systematically create terrorist riots in order to achieve the accomplished fact of arming the Polish people, and with the assistance of the Polish regular army, threatened the German minority and prohibited them from voting in favor of returning to Germany. After the Polish riot in August 1919 was put down by the German army, Britain and France forced the German army to withdraw, and Britain and France formed an international plebiscite committee, with the French army taking over the area. The Poles appointed Goepfert as the plebiscite commissioner. Thus, Goepfert, under the protection of French power, began a large-scale anti-German movement, doing his utmost to terrorize and kill the Germans. In August 1920, Poland, under the protection of Britain and France, launched the second riot. The Poles set fire to German villages and towns in groups, and the abuse and even assassination of Germans were countless. The German people submitted tens of thousands of appeals to the British and French international authorities, but the British and French authorities turned a deaf ear and disbanded the German security team, forming a Polish militia instead, which made it impossible for the German people to vote freely. However, the result was that the majority still wanted to return to Germany. Disappointed, the Poles, under the leadership of Goepfert, launched the third riot in May 1921. At that time, even the enlightened press in Britain and France spoke out for the German nation, believing that it was suffering intolerable persecution. The London Times on May 10, 1922, also publicly stated that the activities of Goepfert and his followers threatened the foundation of the Treaty of Versailles. (Haitong telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive - Vyborg Situation Critical - Mechanized Units Move Out in Force - Vanguard Only a Few Miles from the Key Town</h3>
<p>Danzig - According to news from here today, the Soviet army is now approaching Vyborg, an important Finnish city, only five or six miles away. According to reports obtained by Finland, the Soviet Union is now trying to continue its efforts and launch an all-out general offensive against the Finnish army. It is reported that the number of Soviet troops now in Finland has reached one million. (United Press telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Today is the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army. In the early morning, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive against Vyborg. According to Finnish observations, the Soviet army seems to be attempting to occupy Vyborg before sunset. Red Army tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, and infantry all moved out in force. Vyborg was originally the second largest city in Finland and a major export port for timber. In peacetime, it had a population of 80,000. Currently, there are only a few thousand residents left. (Haitong telegram on the 23rd) Helsinki - The Soviet Russian army launched a large-scale attack on Vyborg on February 22nd. The intensity of the artillery fire and the heavy losses both indicate that the Soviet army is disregarding all sacrifices and determined to win. This is also acknowledged by Finnish military personnel. In recent days, the Soviet Russian army has been fighting very meticulously on that line. Regarding the statement that the Soviet army has approached Vyborg and is only 7 kilometers away, the Finnish General Staff has not issued a denial as of yesterday afternoon. It is expected that more fierce battles will unfold within 24 hours. The Finnish army has now begun to destroy the railways connecting with Vyborg. The railways in Vyborg and Kovisto, Johannes, Keslahti, and Summa, etc., are all undergoing large-scale destruction. (Haitong telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm - According to the Finnish public gazette last night, the Soviet army advancing along the main railway of the Karelian Isthmus has reached a point less than 18 miles from Vyborg. As Vyborg is the object of the Soviet army's current offensive, the extent to which the Finnish army has retreated to the new line between Menner and the front can be slightly known from this gazette. The deepest advance of the Soviet army is west of Summa. Since the Soviet army launched an offensive there, it seems to have gained a two to three mile advance at the cost of great losses in soldiers and equipment. Although the Finnish army claims to be firmly defending the new line, it is clearly under great pressure. The Soviet army's advance on the entire front has clearly unfolded, but on the east side, near Taipale, where the Soviet main force is located, it does not seem to have made progress. According to Finland, the Soviet army has lost 4,500 men in this area in the past week. The Soviet army is now advancing as quickly as possible, completely disregarding the dangers that its transportation may encounter, hoping to attack Vyborg today as an embellishment for the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army. According to a telegram from a Swedish reporter, the front line now extends from Mola, 25 miles east of Vyborg, to the coastal fortress of Kovistu. The Soviets say that this fortress has been captured by the Soviet army. (Reuter's telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communique from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there was no significant development on the front yesterday. In the Karelian Isthmus, the Soviet army repelled the enemy and continued to occupy 21 fortresses, including 15 strong fortifications. The front line was snowy and windy. Soviet air force activity was limited to reconnaissance flights. (TASS telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Activity on the Eastern Coast of England - Three Ships Sunk - British Planes Reconnoiter German Territory</h3>

<h3>Mongolian Puppet Organization Under Japanese Protection</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A telegram from Suiyuan Hua here states that the "Mongolian United Autonomous Government" under Japanese protection, including Chahar, Suiyuan, and northern Shanxi, now has Zhangjiakou as its capital and is chaired by Prince De. It is reported that the government is directly under the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Army, which is also responsible for local security. After the Japanese army occupied Chahar, Suiyuan, and northern Shanxi, the puppet governments established in 1938 were: (1) The Mongolian Autonomous Government of Suiyuan, chaired by Prince De; (2) The Chahar Southern Autonomous Government of Zhangjiakou, chaired by a Chinese named Yu; and (3) The Shanxi Northern Autonomous Government of Datong, chaired by a Chinese named Xie Kang (transliteration). On September 1 last year, the above three puppet governments merged into one under the command of the Kwantung Army, called the "Mongolian United Autonomous Government," with Zhangjiakou as its "capital," and Prince De as its "chairman," with Yu and Xie as his deputies. The government has a "Supreme Council," an "Executive Yuan," and a "Police Yuan." The "Executive Yuan" has several ministries and commissions, and employs Japanese advisors. The "Police Yuan," however, is under the direct control of a Japanese officer. The most powerful figure in the "government" is the representative of the Japanese Cabinet's Asia Development Board, currently held by Major General Ikegami of the Kwantung Army. The puppet government has a total of eight cavalry divisions and two Japanese divisions. The government's finances are controlled by the Mongolian Bank, and the banknotes it issues are called "Camel Tickets" in Mongolia. The Ping-Sui Railway is now managed by the North China Railway Company, which is controlled by the Japanese. All Chinese newspapers controlled by the local government have been suspended. The Japanese have organized the Mongolian News Agency, with a Japanese president. The agency publishes four newspapers in Zhangjiakou, Datong, Suiyuan, and Xuanhua.

<h3>Japan's "Nightlife" Flourishes - Luxury Consumption Expenditures Increase Sharply - Reached 300 Million Yuan Last Year - Fiscal Bankruptcy - Municipal Authorities Anxious</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to official statistics, Japan's "nightlife" flourished in the eight months ending last November, to an extent never seen before. Expenditures on luxury and entertainment totaled 300,000,000 yen, all spent on brothels, geisha houses, coffee shops, and other entertainment venues. In Tokyo alone, expenditures totaled 100,000,000 yen. Therefore, the revenue from entertainment tax has exceeded the government's budget by 56%. Japan increased the entertainment tax starting in early April last year, originally intending to obtain 25,000,000 yen in revenue from this item last year, but the actual revenue from April to November has exceeded 36,600,000, mostly from Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Nagoya. The entertainment tax revenue for December and January has not yet been compiled, but it is known that Japanese entertainment spending in these two months reached its highest level of the year. Therefore, it is expected that in the past fiscal year, this revenue will exceed the budget by 80%. Municipal authorities in cities with naval bases, such as Yokosuka, Chiba, and Sasebo, have said that money is being misused in the cities, while administrative expenses are on the verge of bankruptcy, because naval shipyards, arsenals, and registered personnel are exempt from taxes. At the same time, government industries are making huge profits, the purchasing power of the people has greatly increased, and inflation is increasing day by day. The municipal governments of these cities are extremely anxious, because the demand for education, health, and other facilities is increasing day by day, but there are no funds to meet them. Therefore, they have requested the government to find a way to stop this trend. The Ministry of Finance intends to increase the banquet, reception, and food and beverage tax so that entertainment tax revenue can increase to 500,000,000 yen in the 1940-41 fiscal year, given that the people of the cities are able to spend huge sums on entertainment.

<h3>Five American Fast Ships Sail to the Far East - "Tidania" Arrives in Shanghai on the 5th of Next Month</h3>

<h3>The Japanese-puppet troops in Chao-Shan once again harass the Fujian border but still fail to succeed, launching an attack on Dongshan Island in Zhao'an County, resulting in an intense four-day battle and a complete rout</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Last autumn, Huang Dawei, with the help of the Japanese army, established the pseudo "First Group Army Headquarters of the Peace and National Construction Army" in Chenghai City, recruiting over three thousand bandits and militia from southern Fujian. In mid-November, they were defeated by the Chinese army in Zhao'an on the Fujian border. Huang barely escaped with his life, and the remnants scattered into the deep mountains. Some who were persuaded to surrender by Lin Zhi surrendered with their weapons and were incorporated by Wu Qiwu, Director of the Pacification of the Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi Border, and sent to southern Jiangxi for training. When the surrendered puppet troops marched through Songkou, Dapu, they were still rewarded and cheered by the village chiefs. All those who abandoned darkness for light felt a deep sense of remorse and were moved to tears. The Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi Border Pacification Headquarters received a telegram from the coastal observation post in Chenghai a few days ago, stating that four Japanese transport ships and seven warships were heading from Shantou and Nan'ao towards southern Fujian. Furthermore, according to intelligence from Tuolin, Raoping, on the 10th, one Japanese warship and one armed fishing boat sailed towards Zhao'an County and anchored in Dajinmen Port. On the 11th, a telegram from the Gongkou observation post in Zhao'an reported that four Japanese warships and seven armed motorboats were anchored on Dongshan Island, cutting off sea traffic between Dongshan and Yunxiao Zhao'an. Twenty to thirty monitored ships were detained, and the number of Japanese naval vessels along the coast also greatly increased, showing an attitude of forcibly landing and attacking. Upon receiving the report, Director Wu immediately telegraphed the garrison troops on the Fujian-Guangdong border to strictly prevent and block them. At dawn on the 12th, a thick fog covered the sea, and the Japanese navy landed on Gangkou Township, the richest salt-producing area southwest of Dongshan Island. The puppet troops of Huang Dawei's unit also landed there on Japanese transport ships. The island rises from the sea like a banana leaf, forty li long and wide, with a large mountain in the middle. Its terrain is similar to that of Hong Kong, but the sea water is very shallow, with a pale yellow color. There are 120,000 salt fields on the beach, producing salt worth two to three million yuan annually, which is transported and sold to Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The island has a population of 140,000, mostly engaged in fishing and salt production. Gangkou Village is located in a bay at the foot of the mountain, and the people are very wealthy. The ×××th Division of the National Army stationed in southern Fujian sent a battalion of troops to the island, along with a battalion of salt police, to jointly protect the local area and the production and transportation of salt. On the morning of the 12th, fierce fighting began on the island. Japanese warships opened fire indiscriminately, and the Chinese soldiers and civilians were forced to retreat towards the mountains.</p>
<p>On the 13th, battles took place at Guanlutou and Wuliting. On the 14th, Xipu Salt Field, a salt-producing area, fell, and the Japanese puppet troops attacked the county seat. The Chinese army retreated to the mountains. Fishing boats and salt boats along the island were detained by Japanese warships. Six Japanese aircraft also assisted in reconnaissance and bombing to prevent the Chinese army from crossing the sea to reinforce. On the night of the 15th, the Chinese army launched a counterattack on Dongshan County. About 700 Japanese puppet troops in the city fought in the dark until dawn. Before noon on the 16th, the Chinese army entered the city, and the Japanese puppet troops fled towards Xipu, with only one to three hundred escaping to the ships. It was found that over 1,300 Japanese puppet troops had landed, and after four days of fighting, the casualties were piled up. Over a hundred bodies were left in the city. The Chinese army's victory this time was due to the assistance of the island's fishermen. When retreating, they hid in stone caves on the mountaintop to avoid Japanese aircraft bombing. When counterattacking, they jumped down from the mountaintop in the dark and launched a sweeping operation in several directions. On the 16th, a sweeping operation was carried out on the entire island to search for remnants. Japanese warships continued to bombard the island, and fierce fighting broke out in all directions. On the evening of the 16th, all the Japanese puppet troops on the island were finally eliminated.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education provides relief to students stranded in Hong Kong without schooling, registration has been completed and they will be sent soon</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, in order to provide relief to students stranded in Hong Kong without schooling, specially entrusted Councilor Tao Baichuan in Hong Kong to conduct registration of students without schooling in order to escort them to the mainland to study. It is now learned that the registration has been completed on January 31st, with a total of 460 people. The reporter visited Mr. Tao yesterday and learned that the statistics of applications for registration are very detailed and interesting, and are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Over two hundred and sixty university students</p>
<p>According to the statistics, a total of 268 university students applied for registration, including 249 freshmen, 14 sophomores, 4 juniors, and 1 senior. Among them, 73 were female. According to the statistics, the most desired destination for studying was Yunnan, accounting for 197 people, followed by Sichuan with 54 people, Guangxi with 16 people, and one person willing to go anywhere. One noteworthy point is that more than ten female students were admitted during the unified enrollment last year, but they have been unable to leave due to a lack of travel expenses.</p>
<p>Over one hundred and ninety middle school students</p>
<p>192 middle school students applied for registration, including 50 female students. (1) Junior high school: 15 freshmen, 26 sophomores, and 17 juniors, totaling 58 students. (2) Senior high school: (A) General course: 88 freshmen, 16 sophomores, and 7 juniors, totaling 111 students. (B) Normal course: 6 freshmen, 1 sophomore, and 1 junior, totaling 8 students. (C) Vocational course: 8 freshmen, 1 sophomore, and 3 juniors, totaling 12 students. (D) Three students did not specify their major. Among those hoping to go to the mainland, the first choice was Guangdong with 97 people, Yunnan with 64 people, Sichuan with 28 people, and Guangxi with 3 people. It is noteworthy that the number of freshmen without schooling in junior high school is higher, while the number of juniors is the lowest. In senior high school, the general course has the most freshmen, with the number decreasing year by year. Although there are more freshmen in the vocational and normal courses, they only account for one-tenth of the total number of students without schooling when calculated proportionally compared to the general course. Therefore, it is clear that general course students have the fewest opportunities. The Ministry of Education is actively cultivating vocational and technical talents to address the shortage before the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Registered students will be sent soon</p>
<p>According to Mr. Tao's remarks to the reporter yesterday, he has mailed the registration forms of the students to the Ministry of Education by airmail and telegraphed Minister Chen to expedite the matter. Once he receives a reply, he will send them according to the wishes of each student. According to the application forms, a total of 248 university and middle school students require travel expenses, while the rest can provide their own travel expenses. The date for the next registration will depend on the notification from the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Overview of Wuhan University</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>(Jiading Special Dispatch) In February of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the National Wuhan University, by order of the Ministry, kept the fourth-year students on campus for classes to complete their studies. The second and third-year students were moved to Sichuan. By the end of April of that year, students of all grades in each college were taking classes in Sichuan. Over 1,300 pieces of books, instruments, and machinery were transported to the designated locations in Sichuan Province. According to the statistics compiled by the school for the 27th year, the overview of each college is briefly described below. (1) College of Liberal Arts: Established in 1928, with two departments: Chinese Literature and Foreign Literature, each with one class per grade. In 1929, a first-year class of the Department of Philosophy was added. In 1930, the Department of Philosophy was changed to the Department of Philosophy and Education. In the same year, the Department of History was established, with one class each for the first and second grades. Starting from 1935, the Department of Philosophy and Education was divided into three groups: Philosophy, Education, and Philosophy of Letters and Education, and adopted a major and minor system. Those who chose Philosophy or Education as their major could choose Chinese Literature, Foreign Literature, or History as their minor. Starting from the 27th year, the Department of Philosophy and Education was changed to the Department of Philosophy by order of the Ministry. Currently, there is one class of freshmen. As of the 27th year, the Department of Chinese Literature and the Department of Foreign Literature have each graduated seven classes, and the Department of History and the Department of Philosophy and Education have each graduated six classes. In the 27th year, there were 179 students in the college, including 52 female students (48 in the Department of Chinese Literature, 63 in the Department of Foreign Literature, 32 in the Department of Philosophy and Education, and 36 in the Department of History).</p>
<p>(II) College of Law: When it was first established in 1928, the first academic year only had one class in the Department of Political Economy. In the second academic year, the College of Social Sciences was renamed the College of Law and divided into three departments: Law, Political Economy, and Commerce. Except for the Department of Political Economy, which had both first and second-year students, the Departments of Law and Commerce each had only one first-year class. In the third academic year, the original Department of Political Economy was divided into two departments: Political Science and Economics, according to university regulations. In the fifth academic year, it was also decided to discontinue the Department of Commerce. Currently, there are three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics. Starting from 1934, preparations were made to establish a law research institute. In 1935, the Department of Economics was first established, collecting special books and various materials for researchers to consult and carrying out investigation and compilation work, divided into several items: (1) Cooperating with the Pacific Society to investigate tea in Central China, and publications have been printed by Shanghai Biefa Foreign Company. (2) In the 25th year, the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce obtained the Hankou foreign exchange market quotation and compiled the 30-year Hankou foreign exchange index, which was printed by the school's publishing department. (3) Cooperating with the Hubei Provincial Government to conduct a general survey of industry and commerce in Hankou, which has been compiled into cards. (4) After the outbreak of the war in the 26th year, the school cooperated with the Department of History to organize a compilation committee for historical materials of the War of Resistance. After the relocation to Sichuan in the 27th year, the Department of Economics recruited graduate students and accepted research staff assisted by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. At the same time, the Pacific Society sent a letter seeking consent to cooperate in research on the production and transportation of Sichuan specialties. The Department of Political Science and the Department of Law of the research institute will also be established in order. Research work on political aspects has already begun, and two issues, the Chinese political system and local administration, have been selected for research. The college's Social Science Quarterly has now been published to the fourth issue of the seventh volume, and the compilation of the Wuhan University Series and the works of various professors have been printed, including several types such as Introduction to Political Science, Comparative Political Systems, Comparative Municipal Administration, and Modern International Law Issues. According to the statistics of the 27th year, the college has 253 students, including 24 female students (57 in the Department of Law, 56 in the Department of Political Science, and 14 in the Department of Economics).</p>

<h3>British Embassy denies concluding a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement, the British Embassy issues an official announcement stating that such rumors have no basis in fact</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a public statement from the British Embassy yesterday, stating that the baseless rumors about a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement on the Far East issue have recently resurfaced. According to the rumors, the British government will grant Japan freedom of action in China in exchange for Japan not interfering with British industries. This news has no basis in fact and is completely untrue. There is neither an agreement nor negotiations to conclude such an agreement.</p>
<p>Repeated rumors have never been confirmed</p>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" said that British officials in this city completely deny the rumors transmitted by the American telegram today (23rd) about a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement. It has been rumored twice in the past month or so about a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement. According to today's telegram, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is currently searching for facts about an existing or about to be established secret Anglo-Japanese agreement. There have been rumors in Congress about a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement, but they have not been confirmed for more than a day.</p>
<h3>The establishment of the new "police force" is indefinitely delayed, financial holes continue, Fu Xiaoan still claims that negotiations will be held soon, the closure of gambling dens is just a pose</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that the Public Concession Police Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" will soon discuss the details of the temporary agreement on road construction beyond the boundaries. Regarding this matter, a Japanese newspaper reported on Wednesday that "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan had originally planned to hold a tea party this week to start the negotiations, but because Colonel Igarashi, advisor to the "Municipal Police Bureau", had gone to Nanjing for negotiations, it was postponed.</p>
<p>Postponement announced</p>
<p>To await Colonel Igarashi's return to Shanghai. However, according to Fu Xiaoan's statement to reporters yesterday (22nd), Colonel Igarashi did not leave Shanghai. The postponement of the negotiations was only due to an exceptionally busy schedule this week. The two sides are preparing to meet and discuss within a very short period of time. Judging from these two statements, someone may be trying to obstruct the negotiations between the two sides. At the same time, according to well-informed sources in the Public Concession, from the perspective of the phenomenon, even if negotiations begin immediately, it will probably take a long time, and the "Special Police Force" stipulated in the temporary agreement will be established after a long period of time. As for the order to notify the gambling dens in the Western District to close down within a month, it is still doubtful whether it is just a pose without sincerity. Recently, there are several large gambling dens being developed in the Western District, with huge investments. If these gambling dens do not obtain a guarantee of free operation, they will probably not rashly invest this huge amount of money. Now that negotiations take time, and the "Special Police Force" is postponed, these gambling dens will still be able to continue to operate for some time after March 1.</p>
<h3>Cereal Food Businessmen Resume Operations Today; Fair-Price Flour Has Been Appropriately Allocated to All Fellow Tradesmen; The General Labor Bureau's Measures Benefit the Common People in Practical Ways; 75 Cases in the Public Concession Regarding Rice Issues</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented the fair-price flour sales method on the 19th of this month, citizens have been flocking to designated flour shops to purchase it, causing extreme crowding. As a result, some noodle shops and those selling fried dough sticks and the like have had to suspend operations due to their inability to obtain flour. In light of this, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in an effort to remedy the situation, revised its measures. Starting yesterday, some designated flour shops have ceased retail flour sales, and instead, the daily allotted number of flour bags for each of these shops is allocated to noodle shops, fried dough stick sellers, steamed bun makers, and bakeries to allow them to continue operating. It has been found that there are 302 noodle shops that, starting from the 23rd, have received 1,822 bags of flour (with each shop receiving a maximum of seven bags), and they will all resume operations today. In addition to selling noodles, they can also sell flour separately. The Bureau's measures will ensure that all parties receive practical benefits to some extent. Listed below are the shops that have ceased flour retail sales: (1) Ji Fen Shop, 123 North Zhejiang Road; (2) Wanfeng Flour Shop, 81 East Xinqiao Street; (3) Tongshengchang Flour Shop, 14 Caishi Road; (4) Feng Fen Shop, 20 Burton Road. The announcement regarding the resumption of noodle shop operations reads: "By order of the Shanghai Municipal Council, fair-price machine-made noodles are to be retailed until sold out at a price of 23 cents per market catty, and prices are not to be raised."</p>
<p>Additional Sale of Yellow Flour</p>
<p>Since the commencement of fair-price flour sales on the 19th, purchases have been enthusiastic, resulting in the complete sell-out of flour before the designated time. The Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills, recognizing the large number of people who were unable to purchase flour, yesterday offered several thousand bags of yellow flour (i.e., second-grade flour), which were distributed to the 27 flour shops selling flour, with each shop receiving between 50 and 300 bags. These are also sold at a fair price, which is one yuan cheaper than the fair-price flour, at nine yuan and thirty cents per bag. The quantity is also 49 pounds. The flour shops quickly sold out. However, yesterday morning, three men on Rue Wagner were caught by detectives and arrested for reselling fair-price flour for profit. They will be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Punished</p>
<p>The Fengshun Rice Shop at 670 Ningbo Road was found to be selling rice at a price exceeding the Shanghai Municipal Council's limit of forty yuan per picul. After an investigation by the police, the manager, Yin Hesheng, was arrested on the previous day. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where the police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him under Article 33 of the Regulations on Punishing Violations of Police Regulations. After questioning, the judge sentenced Yin to 15 days of detention as a warning. Furthermore, according to an announcement by the authorities of the Public Concession, there have recently been a total of 75 disputes and other cases related to rice within the Concession.</p>
<h3>Celebrations from All Walks of Life for Wen Lanting's Birthday</h3>
<p>Mr. Wen Lanting, a prominent figure in Shanghai, celebrated his seventy-first birthday the day before yesterday (the 22nd). Mr. Wen himself did not wish for any lavish celebrations due to the current extraordinary times. However, people from all walks of life believe that Mr. Wen has dedicated his life to charitable causes, repeatedly benefiting the masses, and his contributions are immense. Therefore, it is necessary to celebrate Mr. Wen's birthday enthusiastically to express admiration. Although Mr. Wen strongly opposed it, various sectors organized banquets separately to celebrate. Yesterday morning, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Shougu, and Qi Daxiong, among others, first hosted a banquet at the International Grand Hotel to celebrate. At noon, several hundred people celebrated at the Europa Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. In the evening, Yan Chuntang and Yu Xiangqin initiated a grand celebration at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant, attended by three to four hundred people, creating an extremely lively atmosphere. At the same time, numerous birthday couplets and congratulatory messages were received from Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, Zhang Qun, Qu Yingguang, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, among others.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Businesses Request Supply of Legal Foreign Exchange for Raw Materials and Request Mr. Yu Qiaqing to Preside over the Matter; Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Instructs Coal Industry to Supply as Much as Possible; The Market Is Already Short of Goods, and Warehouses and Individual Hoarders Have Not Yet Released Their Stocks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association sent a letter to Yu Qiaqing and others yesterday, stating: "We received your letter of the 16th of this month, which stated, 'Recently, the price of coal in this city has been rising daily, significantly affecting the livelihood of the common people. The prices of coal briquettes, which are essential for daily use, have increased even more drastically, making it extremely difficult for the lower and middle classes to make ends meet. If this continues, the future will be greatly endangered. We believe that you gentlemen of the association are enthusiastic about social security and will undoubtedly consider this issue. We request that you quickly collaborate with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Industry Trade Association to find ways to stop this and discuss both temporary and permanent solutions, so as to fulfill the civic duty of mutual assistance. We await your implementation.' We are deeply grateful for your concern for the people's livelihood and your instructions. We have found that the selling price of our members' factories increases with the cost of production. If we are forced to lower prices, it will inevitably lead to reduced production, which could cause citizens to run out of fuel. Throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not a good policy. The reasons for the increase in costs are foreign exchange and water transportation fees. Hoarders and warehouse receipts are also a factor. Therefore, a temporary solution would be to imitate the method of raising large sums of money to sell grain at fair prices, or to request coal merchants who deal in coal briquette raw materials to supply the existing stock to our members' factories at cost, in order to relieve the extremely poor. As for a permanent solution, it would be advisable to request the authorities, through various public organizations, to provide legal foreign exchange to purchase coal briquette raw materials, and to discuss with shipping companies to reduce the water transportation fees for coal briquette raw materials as much as possible. Furthermore, we request that the Public Works Bureau supply coal briquette and bituminous coal, which would reduce costs, lower selling prices, and greatly benefit the people's livelihood. However, the matter is difficult and beyond the capabilities of our association. We intend to request that you, as a leader of the community, come forward to preside over this matter. If you adopt our proposal, our association will certainly follow you and other public organizations and do our best to repay your instructions."</p>

<p>The Machine-Made Coal Briquette Association sent a letter to Damao, Hancheng, and Tongcheng, stating: "We have recently heard from representatives of the 17 members' factories that the production and shipping tonnage of coal briquette raw materials from the mines are closely related to consumption. Since last winter, the Hongji Coal Mine has reduced production, causing Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, and others to only have enough to transport and process themselves, which is not enough to distribute to small factories. The raw materials produced by Gubart have been heavily purchased and transported to Shanghai by Tongcheng, Damao, and Hancheng at low water transportation fees, and are temporarily not being sold. Small factories are almost unable to supply the market, creating a coal briquette panic. Tongcheng Company has already agreed to allocate a total of 71 tons to the members' factories daily (calculated at 90 yuan per ton), but this is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. However, Damao Company and Hancheng Company still have no news of sales. We specifically request that your association immediately inform the above coal companies to quickly distribute their existing stock to the member factories at the original water transportation fees plus a reasonable profit. We also request that Yitaixing and others allocate some as much as possible, so as to reduce costs and sell at fair prices to stabilize the market. Our association has always admired your companies' concern for society. At this critical juncture, you will surely grant our request. In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this special letter to request that you investigate and reply." At the same time, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the three companies, requesting them to sell their existing stock as much as possible.</p>
<p>Refusal to Sell Coal Briquettes for Cash</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charcoal Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that the resolution of the coal briquette industry only applies to goods sold with warehouse receipts, and cash transactions are generally rejected. Although it is said that cash transactions will resume in the afternoon, members of our association have sent people to wait in the factories all day without success. Sellers call it a "fair price" in name only. We ask, how can we cope with this? Therefore, although our industry has been willing to sacrifice the coal briquettes purchased at high prices during the fair-price period, our stocks will soon be depleted, and we will be unable to supply the market, which will lead to panic or even malicious rumors that we are raising prices under the pretext of no supply, causing us to suffer unjust accusations. We have decided to declare our difficulties and request that your association inform the coal briquette industry association that during the fair-price period, factories should properly allocate and supply the goods needed by our retail stores, so that the market can be supplied. This matter concerns the public interest, and our industry is willing to sacrifice for it.</p>
<p>Accountability for Manipulation and Monopoly</p>
<p>Shen Dingding suggested to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "I have read the four-point resolution of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association to suppress and stabilize coal briquette prices, which was made at the urging of Yu Qiaqing and others. At first glance, it seems that the people in this industry are loyal and sincere in their concern for the people's livelihood, and worthy of admiration and respect. However, upon closer inspection, the so-called manipulation and monopoly of coal briquettes are all controlled by the industry's manufacturers. Today's resolution to suppress and stabilize prices is actually a gesture of generosity with other people's money, which does not cause any loss to themselves and allows them to win social praise. It can be said to be a fraudulent act that kills two birds with one stone. The custom of the coal briquette industry is to trade with warehouse receipts, and warehouse receipts can be transferred without restriction. Coal shops also sell coal briquettes, and they must first purchase warehouse receipts before they can take delivery of the goods. The high price of coal briquettes did not rise overnight to such a peak. The price of warehouse receipts purchased by stores daily is certainly not all low-priced goods. Now that prices are restricted, the first to be affected are the stores. Although coal briquette manufacturers have regulations on price limits, they refuse to sell to stores for cash and only allow delivery with warehouse receipts. Is this not deceiving society? Moreover, most coal shops are small businesses and do not have the ability to accumulate warehouse receipts. Now that the factory refuses to sell for cash, they will inevitably have no goods to supply the market. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes will be even more severely panicked in three days. I am close to the coal industry and understand it better. I dare not remain silent about what I see as dangerous. I have briefly outlined the situation and respectfully hope that you will investigate and make effective corrections."</p>
<p>Association Reports Daily Production Volume</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association reported the estimated average daily production volume of coal briquettes to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday as follows: (1) Member Factories: Guanghua 90 tons, Guohua 160 tons, Huacheng Cuiji 15 tons, Yuanhua 16 tons, Dongfang 130 tons, Nanyang First Factory 85 tons, Nanyang Second Factory 207 tons, Yitaixing 320 tons, Nanyang 9 tons, Yuedong 30 tons, Gongyong 15 tons, Beiyang 15 tons, Hulicheng 30 tons, Heji 6 tons, Yanyan 3 tons, Jinghua 45 tons, Gongping 1 ton, Wufu has stopped production early, Nanfang Changji 10 tons, Xin Ping Anji has no goods; (2) Non-Member Factories: Hujiang 40 tons, Huatong 30 tons, Yixin 10 tons, Lixin 6 tons, Yuandong 2 tons, Gongye 5 tons, Gongtai 5 tons, Huachengxing 5 tons, Huasheng 2 tons, Sanxing 5 tons, Dalu 5 tons.</p>
<p>Various Coal Companies Express Four Points</p>
<p>Zhengchang, Quanda, Yihe, Ruitai, Senyiwu, Tongmao, Shengda, and other coal companies in this city, in order to sell coal briquettes at fair prices, sent a special letter to various public organizations, expressing four points: (1) The price limit of 110 yuan should be strictly observed. If anyone exceeds the price limit, they should be punished according to law and fined a substantial amount or have their business suspended; (2) Coal briquette factories should be required to increase production. If they deliberately reduce production, they should be punished; (3) Coal briquette factories should supply as much as possible to households and retailers; (4) The issuance of new warehouse receipts should be stopped, and orders with existing warehouse receipts should be cleared within a specified period. If warehouse receipt holders fail to take delivery of the goods within the specified period, they should be repurchased at the original price. If the factories deliberately delay or refuse to deliver, they should be treated as hoarding and manipulating prices to achieve a true fair price, not just in name only. At the same time, the First Special District Citizens' Federation sent letters to Yitaixing, Guohua, Nanyang, Dongfang, Yuedong, Hulicheng, Beiyang, Guanghua, Jinghua, Yuanhua, Nanfang, Hujiang, Huatong, and other coal briquette factories, stating that according to reports, these factories still have a certain number of tons of coal briquettes ordered with warehouse receipts. Please provide the names, addresses, and quantities of the warehouse receipt holders so that they can be advised to participate in the fair-price sales together.</p>

<h3>Estonian Nationals Celebrate National Day Today; Ruled by Great Powers for 900 Years; Finally Declared Independence 21 Years Ago; No Unemployment in the Country, and Education Is Particularly Successful</h3>
<p>Estonian nationals in Shanghai will celebrate Estonian Independence Day at the residence of Estonian Consul Long Bo'er at 571 Yuyuan Road from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM tonight. The Republic of Estonia is located on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and serves as a cultural and commercial intermediary between East and West. However, due to its geographical location, it has often been coveted by other countries, resulting in the early loss of its independence. It was ruled by Germany, Denmark, and Sweden for 700 years and was finally annexed by Russia for 200 years. On February 24, 1918, it finally declared independence. The Estonian nation originated from the Finno-Ugric peoples who settled along the Baltic coast 2,000 years ago. Today, 88% of Estonian residents are Estonian, and the rest are Russian and German. 60% are engaged in agriculture, and 12% are engaged in industry, commerce, and other occupations. Estonia has little to no unemployment. Last year, it hired 6,000 miners and agricultural workers from Poland and Hungary. Estonia's main exports include timber, butter, cheese, and eggs. The transportation of livestock to the Soviet Union and timber to the United Kingdom accounts for the largest volume. In terms of education, Estonia implements compulsory education, and primary schools are generally free. Since declaring independence, the cities of Tallinn and Tartu have become Estonia's intellectual and cultural centers. There is one university student for every 236 people, which is the highest ratio in the world. Tartu has a famous university established in 1632 during Swedish rule of Estonia, and Tallinn is also known for its modern art academies. Other specialized schools for agriculture, commerce, and navigation are located throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Fei Qu, Secretary of the Xiqing Department, Witnesses the Dalai Lama; The Dalai Lama Is Handsome, Intelligent, and Wise; The People Prostrate Themselves in Worship; His Mother and Brother See Him Off, and the Young Child Is in Tears</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the six-year-old Dalai Lama of Tibet, Lhamo Dhondrub, held a enthronement ceremony yesterday (the 22nd). Fei Qu, who used to serve as the general secretary of the Xiqing Youth Association in Shanghai, was the first Westerner to see the Dalai Lama. Fei is now the secretary of the Chongqing Youth Association and recently sent a letter describing his experience of seeing the Dalai Lama as follows: "I (Fei) saw the Dalai Lama on his way to Lhasa at the Kumbum Monastery (translated from the Tibetan). We were visiting the temple when we suddenly saw people rushing toward a certain point, which attracted our attention. Looking up, we saw many people walking toward us in a line. The first was a lama, holding a child of no more than five or six years old in his arms. As they approached, the people prostrated themselves before the child, and some even reached out to touch the child's clothes. I suddenly realized that the child must be the new Dalai Lama on his way to Lhasa. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I took out a film and put it into the camera, took a photo, and then quickly rewound the film and took another photo. The Dalai Lama was less than ten feet away from me. Suddenly, I realized that when I was hurriedly loading the film into the camera, the film had run out. Fortunately, my colleague Hua Lai also had a camera nearby and was able to take a picture. The procession moved forward quite quickly and soon entered one of the temple's two buildings. After a brief ceremony, they went to the courtyard, where a bright yellow satin donkey cart was waiting. The Dalai Lama, wearing large boots, was carried into the cart. His mother and brother, with tears in their eyes, entered the two carts behind. The guards, dressed in colorful silks, boarded the cart, and the donkeys moved forward. They set out on a treacherous 1,200-mile journey across the Tibetan Plateau and over the Himalayas to Lhasa, which would take at least two months to complete. The child's appearance is handsome, intelligent, and wise. He must now sever all ties with his family and enjoy a peaceful life. No wonder his mother burst into tears when the grand procession departed for Lhasa."</p>
<h3>Robbers Assault Passengers on Public Buses; Plainclothes Detectives Prevent Crime on Buses; Nine Robbers Arrested in Two Cases</h3>
<p>Recently, robbers posing as passengers have been assaulting passengers on buses No. 1 and No. 9 on Yuyuan Road. In light of this, the Jing'an Temple Police Station has dispatched Chinese detectives and Chinese police officers in plain clothes to prevent crime on these buses. At 2:50 PM the day before yesterday, Xu Ziqing and Jin Haibo, Chinese detective supervisors from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and Chinese plainclothes police officers No. 1037 and No. 2749, were assigned to patrol Bus No. 15063 on Route 1 from Zhaofeng Garden. The two detectives were stationed on the lower level, and the two police officers were stationed on the upper level. When the bus reached Yuyuan Road in front of the Hollywood gambling den, Cheng Guoliang from Huzhou boarded the bus at this stop. At the same time, Wang Jinlong, Luo Gensheng, and Xu Zhongwen, all local residents, also followed him onto the bus and went to the upper level. After Cheng sat down, Wang Jinlong sat in the seat next to Cheng. Wang then reached into his pocket as if to take out a gun and threatened Cheng, robbing him of a wallet (containing more than ten yuan in legal tender) from his pocket. They were about to get off the bus and escape when they were spotted by the police, who stepped forward to arrest them. Wang and the others attempted to resist, but the police fired two shots into the air to warn them. The three men then surrendered and were taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. In another case, Chinese police officer Chen Jinzhang from the Jing'an Temple Police Station was on duty in plain clothes and boarded Bus No. 9 from Zhaofeng Garden, intending to return to the police station. When the bus reached Yidingpan Road, Chen Ronglan, Wang Shili, Jin Zhiming, Ni Ankang, Chai Changfa, and Lu Kensen and other six people boarded the bus and searched the passengers before getting off at Difeng Road. Police officer Chen immediately attempted to arrest them, but he was outnumbered. He followed them off the bus and summoned Chinese police officers to arrest all six men. The above two cases were jointly brought to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested an adjournment on the grounds that the case required further investigation. After questioning, Judge Xiao Peishen ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>The Sacrificial Spirit of an American Priest</h3>
<p>Rescuing a Young Child on an Italian Ship Leads to His Own Death in the Fire</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Italian liner Volaracio caught fire in the Mediterranean on January 20. Most of the passengers and crew escaped. Among the passengers was an American priest named Andrew Reda, who had lived in Shanghai for several years. He died in the fire while bravely trying to rescue a young child. Father Reda was 36 years old and came to Shanghai in 1932. He studied theology at the Xujiahui Catholic Seminary for five years and taught sacred scriptures at Xujiahui for two years. He then went to Rome for further studies and returned here in 1937, staying for another year and a half before leaving Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Cables Zhejiang Province to Alleviate Shanghai's Fuel Panic; Requests Approval to Release 30,000 Bundles of Charcoal on the Yongxiang Ship; Normal Procedures Will Be Completed Afterward</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to alleviate Shanghai's fuel panic, specifically cabled the Zhejiang Provincial Government of Yongkang and the Wenzhou Garrison Headquarters, stating: "Shanghai is experiencing a fuel panic. The Wenzhou Charcoal Transportation and Sales Office is loading 30,000 bundles of Grade A standard charcoal onto the Yongxiang ship, which will soon be shipped to Shanghai to provide relief. We request that your government approve this shipment in advance and instruct the Ou Customs and Inspection Office to release the shipment after inspection. The four-part certificate will be submitted as soon as possible to alleviate the coal shortage (your department has already approved the loading to alleviate the coal shortage, and the usual procedures have been separately requested from the provincial government and will be completed afterward)." Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Truth Revealed in Apartment Murder Case; Investigation Reveals Murder for Money; Murderer Killed His Cousin Motivated by Greed; Family Members Come to Shanghai to Clarify the Case</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of October 21 last year, an unidentified man was found murdered and strangled to death in the washroom of an apartment at 1920 Avenue Joffre. Subsequently, the French Police Detective Department dispatched detectives to arrest the murderer Zhang Rongshu from Siyang, and accomplices Qian Jiesheng, Zhao Yuyin, and Xu Jixian. They were transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. However, during the court hearing, the defendant Zhang Rongshu falsely claimed that the deceased was named Ding Leyuan, who was a notorious kidnapper in Shanghai. He claimed that his grandfather and uncle had been killed by the deceased, and he had strangled him to death in revenge. This was an attempt to cover up his crime. The police have thoroughly investigated and found that the deceased was actually named Zhang Rongfa, 32 years old, from Siyang, Jiangsu Province. He was the cousin of the murderer Zhang Rongshu. He had brought 500 yuan in cash from Shanghai to purchase goods when Zhang Rongshu found out. Zhang Rongshu, motivated by greed, lured the deceased to the crime scene and strangled him to death with a rope. Recently, the deceased's family members heard the news and came to Shanghai to identify the body. The case was heard again yesterday. The police stated that although there was new information in the case, further investigation was needed and requested another extension. Judge Miao approved the request and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Three Detectives Conspire to Extort Oil Merchants; Arrested, Tried, and Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wang Yaokun, the owner of a sesame oil workshop at No. 78 Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession, was known to have a smoking habit and smoked opium at home. Recently, three detectives from the French police, Lu Guanfu, Wang Enhan, and Jiang Xian, colluded with Zhu Gaoji, Wang Kunde, Gao Haogen, and others, exploiting their official positions to go to Wang's house under the pretext of searching for prohibited items.</p>
<p>Threatening Extortion: 5,000 Gold Pieces. Wang initially feared them and offered 600 yuan to settle the matter. However, because Lu and the others were insistent, Wang's family discovered their scheme and reported the robbery attempt to the French police. The police immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the address, arresting all six, including Lu and the others. After interrogation by the police chief, the three detectives, Lu, Wang, and Jiang, were first dismissed from their positions and taken into custody. They were then brought before the Special No. 2 Court, where Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them.</p>
<p>Pretending to Investigate and Adjourning for Further Interrogation: The defendants confessed to the circumstances as reported by this newspaper. It is now learned that Gao Haogen, one of the defendants, was employed as a cook in the victim's household and was fully aware of Wang Yaokun's opium smoking. He informed Wang Kunde, who then invited the three detectives, Lu, Wang, and Jiang, to join in. Lu and the others then further invited Zhu Gaoji to join. Zhu is the illegitimate son of the former French police foreign detective, Alphonse (transliteration), and bears a striking resemblance to a Westerner. Therefore, Zhu was instructed to impersonate a</p>
<p>French Police Foreign Detective: and accompany them to the victim's house to threaten and extort money. After the case was exposed, Zhu's family hired a French lawyer to send a letter to the French police, declaring that Zhu Gaoji was of French nationality and requesting the police to report the situation to the court for investigation. The case was heard again by Judge Zhang at Courtroom No. 1 yesterday morning. The police lawyer elaborated on the case, prosecuting the defendants for crimes such as attempted extortion, obstruction of freedom, and dereliction of duty. The plaintiff, Wang Yaokun, claimed illness and did not appear in court. A neighbor surnamed Wang appeared in court to testify that the three detectives, Lu, Wang, and Jiang, displayed</p>
<p>Handguns and Handcuffs: and described the process of threatening and extorting money. The three detectives, Lu, Wang, and Jiang, denied all the accusations, stating that they were invited by Wang Kunde to collect debts from the plaintiff. The testimonies of the three defendants, Zhu, Wang, and Gao, were evasive. The court, considering the case clear, ordered closing arguments, declared the trial concluded, and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 AM on March 1st. The defendants were remanded to custody.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Insurance Company: Deputy Manager Sues Employees; Defendants Li Yanling and Two Others Found Not Guilty; Weng Guangtian's Ancillary Civil Suit Dismissed</h3>
<p>All employees of the Ning Shao Insurance Company at No. 86 Ningbo Road in this city had previously listed six major charges against the company's Deputy Manager, Weng Guangtian, to the board of directors on the 17th of last month, alleging that he oppressed colleagues and acted improperly. They demanded his removal from office, which once led to a work slowdown. The situation was resolved after the board of directors sent representatives to mediate, and work resumed. Afterwards, Weng Guangtian believed that the employees had disseminated written materials and damaged his reputation, which constituted a violation of criminal law. He immediately reported the matter to the Central Police Station and filed a public prosecution against the employees Li Yanling, Yu Nanyang, and Zhang Yingquan with the First Special Court. At the same time, Weng filed an ancillary civil suit, demanding that the defendants compensate him for the loss of reputation. The case was heard by Judge Zhong Qing in Criminal Court No. 4 at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month. After the defendants presented evidence for each of the charges listed, the closing arguments were immediately declared concluded. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Judge Zhong once again presided over Criminal Court No. 4 to pronounce the verdict. Lawyers representing both the plaintiff and the defendants were present in court. The main text of the verdict stated: Li Yanling, Yu Nanyang, and Zhang Yingquan are found not guilty. The ancillary civil suit is dismissed.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Kidnapping Case on Shanxi Road the Day Before Yesterday: Mrs. Xu Xinliu Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Nanjing Road, a gang of thugs pre-hired a Yunfei Motors car with the license plate number 12245 in an attempt to kidnap a noble Chinese woman wearing a leopard-skin coat who was passing by. The thugs fired a shot and fled in the confusion, fortunately without injuring anyone. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the</p>
<p>Noble Woman: was Mrs. Zhang, the wife of Xu Xinliu, the former general manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. It is recalled that Mr. Xu died the year before last when the Guilin aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation, which he was on board from Hong Kong to Chongqing, was strafed by Japanese aircraft. His wife, Mrs. Zhang, and several family members still reside on Fuxu Road in the French Concession. The day before yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Xu went to Shao Wansheng's Southern Goods Store on Nanjing Road to shop and, upon exiting and reaching Shanxi Road, intended to hire a car to return home. Suddenly, she was confronted by the aforementioned thugs</p>
<p>Brandishing Guns and Threatening: intending to force her into the car parked on the roadside. Fortunately, the driver, Li Amao, was alert and, sensing danger, immediately drove off. The thugs then rushed forward to chase after the car. Another thug, who was standing watch over Mrs. Xu, feared that standing in the middle of the road would attract attention and attempted to push Mrs. Xu into the F茂 Shoe Store on the side of the road to temporarily hide. Mrs. Xu, in a moment of desperation, cried out for help, attracting the attention of passersby. The thugs then</p>
<p>Fired a Shot: and fled in the confusion. Afterwards, the precinct police quickly took Mrs. Xu, along with the car and driver, into the police station for questioning. After questioning, they were allowed to leave. As for the reason why the thugs kidnapped Mrs. Xu, the police are currently conducting a thorough investigation. It is reported that the French police, upon receiving the report, have dispatched detectives to guard and protect Mrs. Xu's residence on Fuxu Road to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<h3>All Southwest Customs Stations Now Have Trade Surpluses; Shanghai's Trade Deficit Also Eliminated; North China Still Has Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>After the Chinese government fully adjusted its foreign trade policy, the overall trade has shifted from a trade deficit to a trade surplus. All customs stations in the Southwest now have trade surpluses, and Shanghai Customs' trade deficit has also been eliminated. However, Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, and Weihai Customs stations still have trade deficits due to the dumping of Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Exchanging One-Yuan Banknotes of the Bank of China: Various Businesses May Exchange Amounts at Discretion; Individual Limit is 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Last autumn, the Central Bank, due to the sudden shortage of one-yuan banknotes in Shanghai, which made exchanging them extremely difficult, transferred all its stored and transported new and old banknotes to personnel of the issuing bureau stationed in Shanghai to oversee the exchange for various businesses. Legitimate merchants were allowed to exchange 100 yuan, and individuals were allowed to exchange 50 yuan, which reversed the panic and returned the situation to normal. Yesterday, a reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the Bank of China that the bank's recent shipment of one-yuan banknotes will still be supplied to the market as much as possible. However, the exchange procedures have been modified. The exchange amount for legitimate businesses and factories may be slightly increased or decreased, to be provided at the bank's discretion. Individual exchanges will generally be limited to 20 yuan to indicate a restriction.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Xiangshan Native Place Association: Fundraising for Flood Relief</h3>
<p>The Xiangshan Native Place Association in Shanghai had an organization before the war and was registered with the city's party headquarters and approved by the city's social affairs bureau. After the war, it lacked leadership, and the association's affairs were virtually suspended. Last year, the hometown suffered severe flooding, with losses estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The general public had no means of livelihood. Local gentry in Shanghai, such as Jiang Meiwu and Liang Zhuoren, concerned about their hometown, could not bear to stand idly by. They specially continued to reorganize the Xiangshan Native Place Association in Shanghai. Yesterday, the reorganization was officially announced at the YMCA, and a flood relief fundraising committee was formed to broadly solicit donations from Xiangshan natives. The Xiangshan County government has sent multiple donation registers, which have been distributed to various natives to expand fundraising. It is hoped that the natives will generously donate to enable tens of thousands of disaster victims to survive. However, due to the heavy workload, there is currently no suitable permanent office address. It is reported that the association has formally sent a letter to the Ningbo Native Place Association, requesting the allocation of the Ningbo Lane address on Lloyd Road to actively carry out fundraising work.</p>
<h3>French Police Conduct Search on Qiqi Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>To maintain security within the French Concession, the French Concession police authorities have been meticulously strengthening their defenses in recent days. In addition to assigning patrol teams to patrol various roads throughout the day, at 6:00 AM yesterday, they also dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to temporarily block traffic on Qiqi Road and conduct a thorough search of pedestrians. The search lasted for over two hours before being lifted.</p>

<h3>Ruichang Hardware Presents Shares to Shareholders; Qian Yiying's Estate Lawsuit; Judgment Orders Step-Mother to Submit Inventory of Estate</h3>
<p>Qian Yiying, a deceased shareholder of Ruichang Hardware and a native of Ningbo, had only one daughter, Ruilan, with his first wife, Chen. Therefore, he took Wang, a woman from his hometown, as a concubine. She resided in their hometown and bore him two sons and two daughters. The son was named Qichang, and the two daughters were named Xueqin and Wenxian. Qichang was already married, and Ruilan and Xueqin had also</p>
<p>Married one after the other. Later, his first wife, Chen, passed away, and Qian then took Ren, a woman from his hometown, as his step-mother. They rented a house together on the third floor, No. 26, Dali Mansion, No. 14 Xin Yong'an Street, French Concession. Later, Qian's concubine, Wang, due to the war, came to Shanghai with her children and younger daughter to seek refuge, temporarily residing at No. 73 Tai'an Lane, North Shanxi Road. However, unfortunately, Qian Yiying passed away from</p>
<p>Illness: on November 12 of last year. All of his estate was held by his step-mother, Qian Ren. Qian's concubine, Wang, and her children demanded a share from Ren, but Ren presented a</p>
<p>Will: disposing of the property that Qian made while on his deathbed, and refused to hand it over. Qian's concubine, Wang, seeing that negotiations were ineffective, immediately hired lawyer Chen Wencan to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Special No. 2 Court on behalf of her son Qichang, elder daughter Xueqin, and younger daughter Wenxian, against Qian Ren, demanding an inventory of the estate and requesting a judgment ordering the distribution of the shares in Ruichang Hardware, worth 1,200 yuan, deposits of 8,900 yuan in the Yu Daheng Rice Shop, deposits of 600 yuan in the Fei Wenyuan Silver Shop, and 20.5 mu of farmland and three houses in Longjiang.</p>
<p>To Hand Over for Public Division: The court accepted the case, and Judge Ma Yishu heard it in Civil Court No. 7. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The defendant hired lawyer Yuan Hanyun to appear in court and argue that all of Qian Yiying's property had already been disposed of in his will, and there was no other property. He presented the will and Qian's handwriting as evidence, asking the court to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court, considering the case clear, ordered the lawyers from both sides to make their closing arguments. Yesterday morning, the judgment was pronounced. The main text stated: The defendant Qian Ren should hand over the inventory of Qian Yiying's estate. The costs of the lawsuit shall be borne by the defendant.</p>

<h3>Rumors Abound, Gold Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial trading of spot gold was characterized by a shift from weakness to strength, resulting in a rebound of over 31 yuan. This was due to rumors of a secret agreement between the Central Bank and Japan, coupled with tightening of foreign exchange, which restored confidence. The morning opening was at 4,785 yuan, a gain of 13 yuan. This was caused by purchases from money changers and gold shops. Subsequently, a money changer aggressively sold off, and silver shops and securities firms also sold off, causing the price to drop to a low of 4,748 yuan. A gold shop then bought inexpensively, and at that time, rumors spread, causing securities firms, etc., to switch from selling to buying.

The noon close was slightly lower at 4,780 yuan. After the close, the market was strong, especially in the afternoon. The market opened high at 4,800 yuan and then leaped to a high of 4,818 yuan due to continued tightening of foreign exchange and aggressive buying by a money changer.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Shares Rebound, Jardine Matheson Shares Plummet</h3>
<p>The securities market yesterday resumed trading for the entire day, both morning and afternoon. The market continued to trend downwards due to the expiration of mortgage loans and the release of goods, but the original large bullish investors had not yet been seen to close out their positions. The large bearish investors continued to release spot goods, and rumors spread in the market. Nonsensical talk is not worth discussing in detail, but excessive buying naturally raises concerns. Bullish investors temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the trend may continue to be downwards. Yesterday morning, the market was stable, and retail investors had considerable demand. Shen Kang and Lianhe both saw buying, while Lianyi had already started selling, and Tongshun No. 64 also had supplies. The prices were slightly firmer than the previous day.

<p>期 Yarn Futures Trading Increases; Arbitrage in February and March Could Yield 2% Profit</p>
<p>The yarn market remains good, but actual business remains sluggish and dull. Only futures trading is exceptionally prosperous. Transactions for March contracts of "Double Horse" yarn are increasing daily, with prices 20 yuan higher than February contracts. Today's highest price reached 882 yuan, while February contracts were at 862 yuan, a difference of 20 yuan. Arbitrageurs can earn a 2% profit. Market discussions suggest there is no hope for easing raw material costs, and sentiment is mostly bullish.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with slight gains of 2-3 yuan, as exchange rates and gold prices remained stable, keeping market sentiment calm. The current month's price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 858 yuan, dropping straight to 855 yuan. Subsequently, due to bullish activity and a sharp rise in the price of a certain yarn, market sentiment was stimulated, gradually rising to 862 yuan. Shortly after, some profit-takers closed their positions, causing a pullback of 2-3 yuan. However, after the market closed, it rebounded again. Statistics for the half-day show a total of 2,675 bales traded, with the price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn remaining similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Procuring; Tongzhou Cotton Packaged at 227 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cotton trading was more active than before. With Japanese merchants starting to procure, market sentiment was further boosted. Chinese factories like Shenxin also actively purchased. Buying and selling among traders was also lively, so the cotton market remained firm. Tongzhou cotton was packaged at 217 yuan. The supply from Northern Jiangsu was only 308 bales of Tong cotton. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<p>Additionally, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Washington's Birthday. The Indian cotton market rose two rupees along with forecasts, while Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 pounds. Liverpool rose two pence.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, foreign cotton trading remained very quiet on the factory side, as they were intentionally more indifferent, since the goods they had previously ordered would be arriving soon. However, traders were more active, with small transactions still occurring daily. It is heard that Japanese manufacturers are scouring the market for regular goods from traders, as traders' selling prices are more than ten yuan cheaper than those offered by foreign firms. The factory prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.875 yuan per US dollar, are as follows:</p>
<p>1,700 bales of Indian cotton arrived yesterday afternoon from Bombay on the British ship "Pungra," docking at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. The cotton was immediately unloaded into the warehouse. (Year)</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Falls Again</h3>
<p>The rice market is again seeing a decline. Yesterday, sentiment remained weak, and the downward trend continued. The reasons for this are none other than that general stores are unwilling to purchase more due to the implementation of price controls, leading to a sudden stagnation in sales, and thus the downward trend continues. From morning to noon, the price of foreign rice successively decreased by about one yuan. The closing prices were 48 yuan for No. 1 Saigon rice, 45 yuan for No. 2 Saigon rice, and 46 yuan for fire-cracked rice. As new national rice is awaited, and floating households are eager to sell off their hoarded stock, the morning market price for small-grained Saigon No. 2 Siamese rice had already fallen to 54.45 yuan per bag. Subsequently, sellers continued to devalue, and the market fell to 53.6 yuan, lacking large-scale acceptance. The market outlook remains bearish. Spot Saigon rice and other types opened low in the morning market, falling by about 6-7 jiao, nearly one yuan, by noon. The market was further dragged down by about half a yuan due to the return of goods. A total of 3,000 bags of spot rice were opened in the general market, with 700-800 tons of returns. Only national rice was being traded, with Liyang special rice selling for 44 yuan and Danyang white rice for 42.8 yuan, each more than half a yuan cheaper than the previous session. It is heard that there were no dark market openings for thick and thin japonica rice.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The spot market for flour remains as quiet as usual. Apart from the sacrifice of 7,500 bags of fair-price flour supplied by various factories daily, not much more has been sold. Yesterday morning, the market for warehouse receipts was stable. Subsequently, due to sluggish sales in the interior by merchant groups, news of increased export subsidies from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the decline in rice prices, market sentiment weakened. It is heard that the initial opening price for old "Chepai" warehouse receipts was 14.7 yuan, later falling to 14.5 yuan. There were no official transactions for other brands. The market is gradually entering a brewing state.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of wheat continued to decline. Recently, official circles have been quite sluggish in purchasing, while Xiexin and Qiangsheng factories have not been weak in purchasing. However, they are paying close attention to the purchase market. Furthermore, foreign merchants have been actively touting foreign wheat, so the Changxi wheat that was sold yesterday was only sold for 25.5 yuan, with a total of 20 cars sold.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand Joins Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Dutch coarse sand turned soft in the sugar market because the price of Dutch electrically produced sugar fell by another 1 jiao to 9.7 guilders, C.I.E.&amp;.K.G. case.

<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth and Woolens</h3>
<p>Spring Sales Gradually Developing</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The market situation for domestic cotton cloth is gradually developing with sales to customers, and market sentiment is firm. However, credit is tight, so futures for next month's delivery are nearly one yuan higher per piece. Yesterday, spot market prices for coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill increased by 1-2.5 jiao per piece. Sales of bleached and dyed cloth were firm, and the amount of cheap goods in the current cushion is still strong in the main street.

<p>The New York silk market was closed due to Washington's Birthday. Yokohama spot prices rose by 25 yuan, and forward prices rose by 26 yuan, but they were slightly lower than the previous closing.

White-headed foreign firms such as Lianmao were active in silk trading yesterday, with 60 dan of Mianyang silk being traded, and the price rose by 30 yuan.</p>

According to the January data, New York imports decreased by 1,690 dan, inventories increased by 3,615 dan, and sales increased by 8,378 dan.</p>

<h3>Prescribe the Right Remedy</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>When I say that soaring prices are not our true enemy in the war of life, it doesn't mean that the threat of prices is not serious; when I say that unscrupulous merchants who speculate and hoard are not our true enemy, it also doesn't mean that unscrupulous merchants are not hateful. At present, I think the people's lives should still be stabilized, prices should still be suppressed, and unscrupulous merchants who speculate and hoard should still be actively banned and sanctioned. However, the greatest effect of these can only temporarily alleviate the people's difficulties, and the people's livelihood cannot be fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>Some people advise speculative merchants to come up with a conscience and regard the current livelihood problem as a moral problem, this point of view is not very correct. This view is a way to treat a headache by treating the head and treating a foot by treating the foot. It is too simplistic to see a complex social problem. Some people also advise the people to calm down. The intention of this advice is good, and it is excusable from the standpoint of the entire society, but the people who are struggling on the hunger line in deep water and fire, their living environment and economic conditions really do not allow them to calm down. You say "Don't worry", but the hungry stomach doesn't allow you not to worry!</p>
<p>The complexity of the current social condition and the heaviness of the illness are no longer fundamentally cured by the licorice of revitalizing morality or the empty words of "don't be noisy". We must first see the condition clearly, so that we will not cast medicine stones, so that we can prescribe the right medicine!</p>

<h3>Silent Airplane</h3>
<p>— Mao Lihuang</p>
<p>For many years, military experts from various countries have predicted that there will soon be an airplane that will fly silently and without a sound to bomb our cities, and no one will know what is going on in advance. This kind of sharp weapon is impossible to prevent.</p>
<p>A completely silent airplane, its contribution to the development of travel and commerce is needless to say, because the sound caused by the engine and propeller is really enough to drive people crazy.</p>
<p>In recent years, the money spent on researching silent airplanes in various countries has been no less than tens of millions. The cost of testing sound-absorbing materials to manufacture a passenger cabin to make air travel comfortable and undisturbed is unknown. But when I think of the terrifying situation caused by a silent bomber, I can't help but feel chills.</p>
<p>If war weapons are divided into two types: attack and defense, then silent military aircraft can be regarded as the most powerful attack weapon.</p>
<p>If a team of these completely silent airplanes flies from an enemy country to bomb our major cities, we will definitely have no way of knowing, let alone sending aircraft to intercept them midway. Because the first step in preventing air raids depends on sound, how can our air defense reconnaissance notify the defending air force since they cannot hear the enemy aircraft approaching?</p>
<p>Assuming that this type of aircraft decides to attack before the day, although we can see it, but there is no sound, how can we estimate the range of our anti-aircraft guns? Because range estimators are mostly based on the sound received by the sound receiver. Without a sufficiently strong sound, our defense equipment will be powerless.</p>
<p>If the team changes to carry out air strikes at night, because the sound receiver cannot receive the sound of the past, our searchlights will not be of much use. In this way, our defense aircraft in the air will be unable to find their target. Cloudy and dark skies are the most effective time for silent bombers to exert their power.</p>
<p>What if such a lazy situation really happens? Our only way is to counter-bombard the enemy's base.</p>
<p>But someone wants to ask: "Is there really such a thing as a silent airplane?"</p>
<p>We have heard of silent airplanes for many years. In 1917-18, we heard that silent airplanes appeared on the Western Front. After that, we often heard that not long ago, we received a report that a mysterious silent airplane flew over the countries of Northern Europe.</p>
<p>The French government has reported several times that a silent airplane flew over the Maginot Line. There was also a time when an airplane with a Saluke engine equipped with a Fokker silencer flew over the heads of several observers at a distance of 500 feet from the ground. Afterwards, they all said in unison that if they had not raised their heads to look up, they would have thought it was a car driving on a nearby road.</p>
<p>In 1932, the Germans had already eliminated 70% of the sound of a high-horsepower engine. If German engineers have already successfully manufactured a silent aircraft, then they know more about the sound and design of propulsion Wang Tao than other countries.</p>
<p>Not long ago, American aircraft manufacturers used a Colt engine to install it in a Douglas reconnaissance aircraft to create a silent aircraft. Flying at the highest speed at an altitude of 8,000 feet, it was actually inaudible on the ground. Later, with the addition of new camouflage techniques, according to witnesses, the aircraft was completely invisible from the ground.</p>
<p>In 1918, the British created a very good silent aircraft. However, it was not applicable due to the excessive weight of the components.</p>
<p>In short, whichever country has a silent aircraft, their aerial vehicle is ten years ahead of the air force of any other country. A famous old general once said: "You can't fight something you can't see!"</p>

<h3>The Young and Successful Welles</h3>
<p>— Xing Lang</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt, in order to obtain detailed information on the overall European situation from "unbiased observers," specially dispatched Under Secretary of State Welles as the President's personal representative to Europe to investigate the current situation. Mr. Wei has already left New York on the 17th of this month by transport to Italy.</p>
<p>Welles was born in New York City on October 14, 1892. He entered Harvard University at the age of eighteen. One year after graduation, he took the position of secretary of the Japanese embassy, ​​which can be described as a spring breeze and a very early start. He was transferred after two years in Japan. In 1922, he served as a representative to the Sino-U.S. Conference held in Washington. In 1924, he first decided to use the qualifications of a personal representative of the president to mediate the revolution within the Sino-U.S. Honduran Republic. Therefore, Mr. Wei's trip to Europe this time is the second time in his life that he has artificially served as a personal representative of the president to handle diplomatic affairs abroad. This sale is the most memorable for Mr. Wei's personal life, and it is comparable to Colonel House, the personal representative sent to Europe by the late U.S. President Wilson during the First European War. In the same year, Mr. Wei</p>
<p>was re-appointed as a representative to the Sino-U.S. Conference held in Amapala, Honduras. Mr. Wei took office as Under Secretary of State on April 6, 1933, but less than a month later, he was transferred to be the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba on the 29th of Chiyue. He was transferred back to the United States on December 15 of the same year and continued to serve as Under Secretary of State. Mr. Wei did not marry until he was thirty-three years old (1925). His wife, Miss Thompson, is a celebrity in Washington. Mr. Wei belongs to the U.S. Democratic Party and is a follower of the Anglican Church. He is the author of the book "Napoleon's Vineyard," published in 1928.</p>

<h3>The Heart of an Elementary School Teacher</h3>
<p>— Wang</p>
<p>I don't know how many twists and turns, how much trouble, how many times I endured embarrassment, and how many times I accompanied a smile to exchange for a "pure" elementary school teacher's position. But now, I regret it again. I regret why I was so easily subdued by the monthly salary of twenty yuan a month; I regret why I was so easily driven by a half-knowledgeable "principal". For several months, a stable heart has been trembling more and more in my chest.</p>
<p>But the environment doesn't allow me to do this: innocent children clamor for me to tell interesting stories. Their bright little eyes shine, and they use the most regular sitting posture to show their welcome. Holding back everyone's nasal smell, Wenfu melts into the quiet atmosphere. I began to feel the need for me to stay here. I can't leave, I'm sorry for the ten lovely children - they will give me the greatest comfort, they will compensate for my pain.</p>
<p>That way, I worked according to the command of the bell, and I was left behind.</p>
<p>However, things will follow, and when I finished the first Chinese class one day, I was called by the principal in the corridor. He put on a hypocritical smile to welcome me into his room. Then, with a long and sophisticated attitude and tone, he said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. ×, please don't tell the children about current affairs in class in the future, and you don't need any extracurricular reading materials, because..." Then he groped his hands all over his body and continued, "Because, a, the parents also oppose this, they also wrote a letter...</p>
<p>However, I didn't understand his words, I stood up and walked out, he followed out, and shouted loudly from behind:</p>
<p>"Don't do this next time! Did you hear me?"</p>
<p>I walked downstairs with my head down. I knew that this voice was the lesson that the manager taught the store apprentice. At the same time, I also felt many elementary school students cast a string of suspicious eyes on me</p>
<p>My heart started to tremble again But I was worried about life. I strongly longed for life, and it didn't allow me to easily abandon my position. I know that I don't know how many people are dreaming day and night about this half-position.</p>
<p>Although I worked with peace of mind listening to the command of the bell, my heart was always trembling.</p>

<h3>Returning from Beyond the Great Wall: Records of Mongolian Photography and Condolence Telegrams (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yao Shiquan (Chongqing Aviation News)</p>
<p>To produce the film "A Compilation of the Northwest," "China" sent me along with the Northwest Wartime Mobile Education Unit of the Military Training Department to the Northwest. We departed from Chongqing, first to Shaanxi, then to Ningxia. The Education Unit began its work in Jinji County, Ningxia, and our photography team went to Alxa in Mongolia. Prior coordination with various parties had been completed, so the work progressed relatively smoothly. There were four of us in total.</p>
<p>On the first day, we arrived at Wuzhong Fort, and on the second day, we arrived in Ningxia. After spending several days in the desolate desert, we finally reached Dingyuan Camp on the sixth day. Unfortunately, a strong wind was blowing, and dust and sand filled the entire sky and earth. Amidst the flying sand and stones, we entered a small inn. Just as the wind was about to subside, the Alxa Khoshuud Mongolian government specially sent personnel to welcome us. They rushed to take our luggage and sent it to Yong Sheng Hao, which resembled a guesthouse. Their enthusiastic hospitality made us feel quite uneasy. The next morning, we went to visit the banner government. Prince Da was still in Lanzhou, so we were received by the Chief Associate, Roonke Baator. He could speak fluent Mandarin, so we had a pleasant conversation. During the meeting, the Chief Associate gave a sincere speech: "We hope the Central Government can understand the backwardness of the Mongolian compatriots' knowledge and that they have not yet made a significant contribution to the war of resistance. However, patriotism should not lag behind others. We should unite and uphold the national policy of resistance against Japan, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, all ethnic groups should unite sincerely! Resist Japan to the end! Drive the Japanese out of our country..."</p>
<p>Director Zhang of the Ningxia Provincial Government's Office in Dingyuan Camp often accompanied us to visit various places, such as Lama temples, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, libraries, and Mongolian and Tibetan schools... We prepared for two days of photography work, all of which had been prepared by the banner government. They also sent a Mongolian translator and three assistants, making a total of seven of us. We carried dry rations, rode camels, and ventured deep into the "Alxa" desert to find our photographic material.</p>
<p>After riding swaying camels for three days and spending three nights in tents in the desert crawling with lizards, we finally arrived at "Hetun Salt Lake." Originally, we wanted to go to "Jilantai," but it had not yet started operating. The area of "Hetun Lake" is twenty li in circumference, and the salt production is very rich. Unfortunately, transportation is blocked, so it has not been possible to extract it in large quantities. More than twenty people have already been employed. The land has now been nationalized. Due to inconvenient transportation, production has been excessive, so workers cannot get the work they deserve every day, and their lives are very difficult. We worked here for two days...</p>
<p>The Mongolian comrades who came with us liked to drink very much, and we also drank a little. Along the way, we received a lot of help, such as riding camels to fetch water ten li away, cooking and setting up tents every day, and even singing Mongolian songs for us to listen to. Everyone seemed very close. On the evening of our departure from "Hetun Lake," an informal night party seemed to have opened on the pit. Everyone talked happily until very late. We found many daily necessities and distributed them to the three Mongolian comrades. They were very happy and surprised to see these many daily necessities.</p>
<h3>On Liu Yanting's Performance of Farewell My Concubine</h3>
<p>— Xiaohong</p>
<p>Since the death of Yang Xiaolou, there has been lament over the difficulty of finding talent for the role of Xiang Yu in the play "Farewell My Concubine." However, the famous net performer Liu Yanting can barely suffice. Liu Yanting is the younger brother of Yang and Liu Yanting. He has collaborated with Xiaolou for many years. He is familiar with all of Xiaolou's voice, appearance, and manner. He has put a particularly deep consideration into "Farewell My Concubine." When Xiaolou was alive, Yanting had performed in this play with Du Fengyun, and his aura and voice were remarkably similar. After Xiaolou's death, Yanting became well-known among the people of the old capital for his performance in "Farewell My Concubine." The famous drama critic Ling Linghan even praised him as Xiaolou's successor. This time, when Shi Xin and Li Yanxiu performed this play, they requested that Yanting play the role of Xiang Yu. Yanting declined humbly, saying that he was old and might not be able to perform satisfactorily. After repeated requests, it became a reality. On the day of the performance, Yanting was in high spirits, not diminished in his former style of singing and roaring. The beauty of his painted face was unparalleled. The scene of bidding farewell to the concubine before the account was tragic and desolate, gathering the essence of the entire play. After Xiaolou, he is the only one. Li Yanxiu is both literate and martial, and her portrayal of Yu Ji is most appropriate. Her sword dance skills are unmatched by ordinary female performers. Her waist, legs, singing, and recitation are all excellent. Her collaboration with Yanting in the performance is sure to be sonorous and bright, with applause resounding in all directions.</p>

<h3>Pinocchio</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yifan</p>
<p>Became Reality</p>
<p>They Escaped from the Whale's Mouth</p>
<p>As the whale moved, Gepetto inside prepared to fish, but unexpectedly caught his own son—the strange son with donkey ears and a donkey tail—in the incoming seawater. Father and son both shed tears of joy.</p>
<p>They discussed their escape plan inside the whale's mouth. They pieced together all the wooden blocks and planks to make a raft, and then burned the chairs, stools, and wood chips to create a fire. The smoke from the fire pushed their small raft out of the whale's mouth.</p>
<p>The Whale Followed and Chased</p>
<p>They paddled desperately, trying to escape, but the angry whale saw them and chased after them, smashing their raft to pieces in an instant. Fortunately, they were all washed ashore by the tide, and even Jiminy Cricket reunited with them.</p>
<p>They were saved, but Pinocchio lost consciousness. He lay quietly on the beach as if dead. Home was still the same as before, but there was no life at all, quiet and cold like a tomb. Everyone was very sad.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a ray of dawn appeared in the darkness, shining on the lifeless puppet. Faintly, there seemed to be some voices saying, "Be brave, honest, and selfless, and then you will become a real child."</p>
<p>No one else heard this voice, but Pinocchio woke up.</p>
<p>Pinocchio was resurrected, no longer a wooden puppet, but a real child of flesh and blood, a beautiful and intelligent child.</p>
<p>The kind old Gepetto finally got such a lovely son. The loyal Jiminy Cricket was even happier. He received a dazzling medal with the big word "Conscience" written on it.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Just as this magazine finished serializing "Pinocchio," the film has already been transported to Shanghai, and it will probably meet the readers soon. This good news is worth reporting. I think everyone must be very happy.</p>
