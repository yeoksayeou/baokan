<h3>維希俯仰由人　賴伐爾又為座上客　德間諜要求擴大領土佔領法內閣舉行會議商討對策</h3>
<p>維希　官方公佈稱、法國元首貝當大將昨晚八時十十八分接見前任外長兼副元首賴伐爾、共同討論一般政治局勢、賴伐爾係於上星期六被革職、渠內得駐法德國大使亞培茲之請求、不復受法國警察之監視、（十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>貝當前日接見德大使亞培茲</p>

<p>擴大佔領要求將為今後課題</p>
<p>維希　解職之法副總理賴伐爾、昨夜返抵維希、賴氏顯然藉德國之重大壓力、已受法政府之優待而恢復自由、希特勒之親信德駐法大使亞培茲、已啟程赴巴黎、將以電話向希氏報告「一般局勢」、此一般局勢、雖因謠言衆多、益以新聞檢查、甚為嚴密、以致混沌不明、但德國對法使用壓力、則日益顯著、簡短之政府公報謂、賴伐爾　貝當元帥、曾與德大使亞培茲·法海長達朗上將·陸長洪齊格將軍·以及前外長鮑多恩、共同舉行會義、據倫敦每日電聞報消息、德國要求擴大佔領區之最後通牒、大槪將繼賴氏開釋之後而提出、（十八日國際社電）</p>

<p>倫敦　據法國非淪陷區德國邊界來電、謂維希前副德理兼外長賴伐爾之免職、雖其主因似為對內政策、但維希來訊、迄未完全闡明其原因、賴伐爾力圖使維希總理貝當上將成其親德政策之工具、或已　强硬　對、而此種反對已因地中海局勢之改觀更趨堅强、聞賴伐爾上週曾以範圍廣大內部改組之建議、與德方和平新提議交維希內閣、皆遭否決、事後貝當延見賴伐爾、據衆推測貝當　欲採行較賴伐爾更榮譽之政策、而決不到致准將法國殖民地根據地交德國支配、惟英國在地中海獲勝、已使維希海長達朗海軍大將為首之一派人物復起、法德單獨　和之希望、其所以抱　希望者、以義國已大見荏弱、法國今或能勸德國取消其對法之大部分要求、而此前使法德談判僵化之障碍、亦或可加以解除矣、賴伐爾政策旣全告失敗、故維希新外長佛蘭亭准行此項政策、勢必審　將事、德國特使亞培茲之赴維希、足見德國對佛蘭亭出長外務、不全滿意、甚至謠傳德國或覺有派兵佔　里昂之必要、就義國來訊觀之、義人對於戰局惴惴不安與日俱增、如義境盛謠前義軍總參謀拔道柯里奧上將與其他將領已因叛國而遭槍擊說卽其一例、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>賴與貝當齟齬被禁古堡三日</p>
<p>紐約　合衆社得歐洲密報、法總揆貝當、力斥副　總統賴伐爾陰謀攫奪殘餘法國之政柄、故在內閣會議面前强迫其草寫自己之辭呈、在此一幕緊張之情景中、八十四歲之老將軍與面目　黑之副總理、怒面相對、不久以後、賴氏遂被警察軟禁矣、至昨日始以德大使之幹旋、恢復自由、再度與貝當上將會商、據聞賴氏　陰謀自任總理云、賴氏下台後、其公事房卽被警察搜查、而政府所在之公園旅館四週、有大隊特等警察戒備、並有便衣隊秘密警察及共事警察長茫　奈爾率領便衣隊開屋門、將賴氏據至二十英里外之賴氏私人古堡、與其妻女同加鎖閉、武裝警士在堡外看守者、凡歷三日、至佛蘭亭氏則十日前已由貝當上將、詢以倘賴氏辭職、彼是否在願繼其任佛氏遂卽向德方請示結果良好云、（十八日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>慢性病的泰越糾紛</h3>
<p>泰越間的領土爭執、自從上月下旬開始武裝衝突以來，為時已近一月：其間國際方面所發生的重大變動有軸心威勢的失墮，英美援華制日的增强，以及最近法國政局的更張，然此種種，舉不足以影響泰越間的敵對行動。雖至今尚水演化而成大規模之正式戰爭，但仍在繼續發展之中；蓋在歐非的英希德義以及遠東的中日戰局而外，業已另自形成局部慢性痼疾的狀態。日來並傳桂南已發現有在某方卵翼下武裝齊備的越南「復興軍」，而越南內部亦復一再發生變亂，更增加了越南半島形勢的複雜與艱危。長此以往，此一星星之火，是否將至燎原，正復難言；但在今日遠東危局之中，不能不視此為一最可憂慮的不幸狀態。以泰越雙方本身而言，各自缺乏作戰的充分條件，而其所爭執的焦點又都是四五十年來的懸案，並沒必須立即解決的新因素；乃事實發展，却偏要在這遠東大局異常動盪之際，造成悠久的糾紛，這固　泰方厲行國家主義政策與法國戰後國勢削弱使然，但終雖令人瞭解促進此一糾紛者的用心究竟何在。其中野心的煽動當然是動力之一，而綜觀泰方動向，對於此一外來助力，亦似乎並不敢深加信任。如果不是軸心陣綫在歐非連遭挫折，以致準備與之互為呼應以擾動遠東大局者失　憑藉，則越泰兩邦以至整個南洋將成何等景象，正復難於想像。事之可異者，殆莫過於泰越當局際此時艱，郤都不能有所領會，而唯斤斤於蝸角蠻觸的領土爭執，馴致將由相持而至於戰爭；他們似乎對於眞正危機的襲來，反而視如不見；甚至欲挾野心者的助力以自重，或竟欲其居間為仲裁，無識不智，莫過於此。據最近消息，　方當局都有過希望和平解決的趨勢，但還沒有互相讓步的象徵；而且法越當局則聲稱對泰軍進犯將予以嚴厲報復為對付；泰方則表示非到一平等待遇完全袪除，行動決不中止；似此情勢，則談判仍難望其迅速有所成就。</p>
<p>所有南中國海上　直接間接都是日本南進政策所引起，但此際的國際現勢，顯已不利於明目張胆的大規模冒險；則在另一方面，自不免要加緊製造或覓取可資利用的有利機會，以謀實現其野心；類如泰越戰爭以至越南境內種種變亂，都恰好適合此種要求。這在越南，雖其北部目前已遭囊括，那祗能算是成就了野心國的一個初步準備；蓋僅此北部，在南進的軍事價値並不很大；而康蘭灣與西貢纔是其必不肯放鬆的重大目標；因為那兩據點適如南中國海的心臟，足以與海防海南島台灣聯成一氣，形成南進的最前綫根據地。最近泰越軍事行動都在湄公河下游一帶，很容易波及越南南部全境；假如日方所願獲遂，則南中國海的攻守形勢當完全改觀，荷印馬印所遭威脅亦當更見嚴重。因此之故，關於泰越問題絕不容僅以為星星之火加而加以忽視。</p>
<p>本報日前縱論泰越糾紛，曾指出其實現妥協之困難，一在於雙方本身難得折衷的焦點，其次則雙方之外，暫無國際壓力可資運用，不幸此種形勢至今仍未見有所改善。但現在的問題已經不僅是在客觀上泰越妥協有無可能，而是為了確保南中國海與整個南洋的安寧，越南半島的危機有必須予以袪除的必要。如果此一任務不能實現，則對於南洋的保衛當感到加倍的艱難。英美等關係國家為了投鼠忌器，恐怕在客觀上形成為為淵敺魚的結果，因此不願參預其間，從事斡旋，但如此在任以聽其自然發展，更非得計。固然，此一爭執的仲裁極感困難；其至低限度，亦應對雙方進行仁至義盡的勸吿，並提供保證，將此領土糾紛保留至將來國際秩序恢復後再謀合理的解決。目前越泰當局希望和平解決的表示雖沿微弱，却應視為悔禍之仿的萌芽，於此正應加以有力鼓勵以促成其進一步的覺悟。以此際情勢言，無論泰國或越南，其當　難題絕不是彼此間的領土陳案，而是第三國的野心覬覦。以越泰半島的豐饒富厚與戰略地位，本已具備匹夫懷璧的條件，何况更復互作鷸蚌之爭？於此除切盼泰人憬悟其處境之危殆與妄想借重漁翁之非計而外，更望法越當局能瞭解泰方之索土，實為法越前此對日讓步後所招致的後果；如法越對日方苛索不能堅守壁壘予以峻拒。則即使以武力對付泰方，亦無以服泰人之心而杜絕其輕藐。及今亡羊補牢，尚不過晚，惟在當事者的善為調度而已。</p>

<h3>歷史上最大盛會　紐約世界博覽會閉幕（續）</h3>
<p>捷克斯拉夫館中的藝術品，除若干已售去外，多半將借給各博物館陳列。已西館中的珍種熱帶鳥，移送於中央公園。聯邦大厦中的美國國家出品，將分送於華盛頓各部會。外國區陳列館中的東西，以後將留置於「豐茵公園」中者，尙有瑞典館前的扯旗桿，土耳其館前的噴水池，和加拿大館前的花柱。</p>
<p>據工商業專家的意見，此决紐的世界博覽會中所陳列各種實業出品，對於工商之推進，知識之灌注，興味之提起等，收效甚著。各廠商的陳列品在閉幕之後，或運往別處展覽，或移至本行支行陳列，各就其環境及需要而定，所以沒有別個博覽會觀光的人，對於實業界方面的陳列品，將有重新看見的機會哩。</p>
<p>藝術部鬥的出品，單就各國大畫家的精品而論，價値美金三千萬元。在閉幕後之至日，當局派了武裝警察，用十多輛大卡車，把這些人間壞寳，移置紐的市的棧房中，以待二白餘出品者，及一百多博物院當局的領回。並非以營利爲目的的「藝術會公司」，一待各出品歸還原主後，卽行解散。近代作家的藝術作品，亦將一一歸還原出品者。</p>
<p>珠寳部門的陳列品，價値美金六百萬元，在閉幕之日，在武裝保護之下，移出會塲。珠寳館建築並不加以拆卸，將來留置於「豐茵公園」中，作爲點綴之一。珠寳出品商共有六家，還些東西於閉幕之後，卽重歸原主，使它們一一珠還。</p>
<p>博覽會中的東西，許多都是價値甚大的，姑不具論。卽就各種建築物而言。五花八門，心裁獨出，有未來派，有富有國家觀念者，有地方色彩者不一而足。觀光者對於「明日世界」的一切表現，無不賞心悅目，看個一飽。而且爲欣賞及紀念研究起見，遊客們無不當塲攝影，以爲他日神遊之助。據會塲中攝影股中任貴兩馬士氏的估計，遊客中的百之六十二都帶有鏡箱，隨時把心喜的景象一一攝入「卡末拉」中。</p>
<p>十月二十八日上午二時起，這盛極一時的　的世展，便開始其拆卸之程了。除了留作「　茵公園」中的點綴品者之外，所有屋宇，「高碑」，「圓球」，花園，華盛頓像等，價値六千萬元美金的建築，全都要加以拆卸。爲便利拆卸工程的進行起見，全區已分爲八個部份，分工進行。所要拆除的屋宇，計屬於實業方面的五十所，外國陳列館二十二所，美國政府房子四所，娛樂塲區中一百二十五所。統計起來有三百八十五所建築物要加惟拆除，其時間可自四個月延長至六個月之久。自塲會中央的憲法院，坦道，蔭樹直面至和平廣塲的一段，將保存於「豐茵公園」中。「國際湖礁」中的許多複雜噴水池，拆卸之後，卽行出售。</p>
<p>「豐茵公園」的原來計劃，係在公園中闢網球塲七十二個，棒球塲二十四所，遊玩塲十一所，跑道三十一英里，脚踏車道五·八英里，馬道四·七英里，湖中有可容六百人乘坐的小艇一隊。此外尙有室內運動塲，溜冰塲，游泳池。這個公園大的在明年年底卽在一部份可以完工，完全落成之期則將在一九四二年底。</p>
<p>本年博覽會中的「大白路」和娛樂塲，除了本錢開支之外，尙有盈餘。塲區的範圍雖較一九三九年路小，　是各種燈光　條的配置，其力量加强了七倍有奇，故　觀衆的吸引力，比之前年大爲增進。娛樂塲中的各種遊玩東西，閉慕之後，卽　出售。全國各處的遊藝塲老闆，都想把它們弄來，聞其價値尙及原價的一半云。娛樂塲中最出風頭的一種表演，卽　航空中的跳傘運動，在前後兩决會期之中，參觀過這種空中表演的，的有二萬人之多。</p>
<p>娛樂塲中最具號召力的爲水中表演，兩年中付費參觀的看客共有八百萬人，今年爲三百禺人。其他如巴黎街景表演，跳舞營，音樂館等，參觀者達四百八十六萬人之多。國慶紀念遊行時，參觀者達二百萬人。這都是會塲中的人數高紀錄。</p>
<p>開會期中各種犯罪事件甚少發生，警務當局的遠捕案子祇二百五十四起，大半多爲行爲不檢的輕罪。除了七月四，波蘭館的炸彈爆發，傷亡八人外，共他並無顯著的罪紀錄。盜刦案子也很少很少。一九三九年會期中，羅馬尼亞館中曾被刦酒和白蘭地一千八百六十瓶。三日之後原犯就捕賊物全返原主。會塲警察於閉慕兩週後，仍將權續服務。</p>
<p>本年會期中的意外事件比之一九三九年少去百分之五十。據會塲醫務主任荷干德醫師報吿，本年會期中求治療的人計三萬名，各種病症都有。所患的病大半爲眼疾，頭痛乏力，足痠等。一九四〇年中，在會塲中死亡的人計祗十四名。十二人爲心臟受震，二人爲受彈片炸傷不治者，一九三九年中死亡率亦爲十叫人，惟一人爲受意外事件而身死者。</p>
<p>使所各地道至會塲者其人數總共為九千萬人。搭乘美國快運公司及野犬公共汽車公司之車輛者計三千萬人。其中允以公共汽車公司的生意最好，計佔二千八百五十萬人之多</p>
<p>博覽會公司所闢的停車塲中，在兩年會期中所停的汽車計一，八〇〇，九一一輛，今年則為八〇〇，〇〇〇輛。今年的停車費爲每輛二角五分，較之一九三九年减低五角。</p>
<p>據美國財務部偵察股報吿，一九四〇年會期中，會塲中使用的僞幣達六百八十四元四角。去年爲一千三百七十六元二角。偽幣中之一百三十二元屬於假鈔，五百五十二元則係贋幣云。　（完）</p>

<h3>金融　外滙動盪中卒轉緊</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、鬆後復緊、走勢不易捉摸、蓋投機商步伐欠齊、人心稍帶浮動、而神經過敏之輩、仍作多頭迷夢、見鬆思扒、至本日晨初、美匯曾做開五元八七五、但午收卒吿軟達五元八一二五、英金亦回、爲三辦士六七一八七五、午後週三無市、比隔昨軋緊〇一五六二五、與〇三一二五、</p>
<p>投機商進期貨美匯</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均降〇六二五、紐的銀價平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英未更、對滬大一分、中央掛牌各匯如　銀行晨開、現貨實價、英金三辦士六八七五、美匯五元八四三七五、俱與上日晚收價無異、開後華商投機家來售、立見　動、計夾行麥加利吸入本月美匯五元八七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅低百分之〇·五〇、此後市面沉靜、十時過後、始見日商銀行三井向外行結納一月份美匯價爲五元八四十三七五、繼之投機商亦起扒意、向外行及華行購期貨美匯不少、致潛勢遂趨軟化、計一月份美匯做開由五元八四三七五至八一二五、但延至收盤、八一二五已吿難結、收盤價近現期英金吿三辦士六七一八七五、美匯五元八一二五、遠期英金三辦士六五六二五、美匯五元七八一二五、較之上日晚收、英金期現緊〇一五六二五、美匯縮〇三一二五、午後週三無市、</p>

<h3>北幫傾進　金巿昂騰　塲外六千元有買戶</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、跌後突復轉漲、致五千九百元大關又曾破入、後復回出、乃傳說轉利於買方、且聞北帮來傾進三千餘兩、外匯又帶緊、各方人心重向上、自晨開市承上日頹勢、卽退至五千九百〇五元、證券帮又來吿、退至五千八百九十元、外匯止鬆趨緊、利多傳說忽起、謂「新中央銀行及發行流通券之說復盛證券帮金號之爭進、北帮並有加進之訊、遂起劇烈昂勢、直飛上至五千九百六十五元、終爲五千九百六十元、軋升三十八元、有六十五元上落、上半日交易共六千兩左右、下午週三無市、塲外價已升至六千元有買戶、掉期小錢莊互做五百數十兩、買方貼出予賣方三十六元、現金由金號出錢莊五十兩價比期交低三十六元、銀號互做五十兩、低三十五元、飾金升五元、爲六百十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤好卅八元</p>

<p>飾金掛大五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行與新同行晨掛六百〇五元、正午升五元、爲六百十元、收進减三十元、</p>
<h3>日鈔需要激减</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、跌後突漲、英美金鎊、亦係先跌後漲、終升一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票始曾退至十七元零一分、但旋卽步漲、卒爲十七元二角牛、比上日計漲二角、香港票需要又殷、市價挺漲、日金票需要激减、晚市退爲一元五角七分半、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍爲一元三角三分、</p>
<h3>糧食　米巿暗動　脚跟不鬆</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市依然在擯持狀態中、迺以市塲監視嚴緊、此輩無法私作暗盤、而懷貨者對於高　仍不願脫出、僅一般中段貨稍有交易、然亦以心思家見市面無所希望、納意轉懈、同時實銷因恐市面不升卽降、抱　健主義、都已袖手，故結果各色洋米價呈無榮無辱之局面、而趨勢業覺衰退、</p>
<p>厚薄粳到貨猶稀、所以早市人心頗堅、喊聲曾繼續提高、惟後因洋米市不振、卽復回軟、故結果售開各價、較之前市堪稱定局、崑山斛見白粳仍爲百元、九十九元、特別一百零二元、靑角見薄稻九十一元至八十九元、</p>
<p>糯米雖在不受限之例、無如用途不廣、致銷塲方面、無論實胃及囤收者均已轉遜、不過貨中尙無鬆脫之意、是以售價勉爲站住、未起變化、若宜溧白元爲丸十五元、香港白元特別八十五元、普通八十三元、糯茶七十三五元、</p>
<p>洋米叉有到滬、太古公司綏陽輪、由香港裝來一千二百五十九包、昨日淸晨抵滬、停靠浦東碼頭、定今日改泊法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>麵粉亦做暗盤　巨額洋粉將到滬</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉、堅穩異常、蓋自前日野猪牌花神牌澳粉開至二十二元高價後、投機囤戶進意猶方興未艾、惟雜糧公會、鑒於麺粉亦有投機操縱、深恐體成意外、嚴禁在市買賣、兼米價稍形安定、聞花鳥鐘樓牌仍須二十一元五角、及黃金牌二十一元三四角、三角牌二十一元、成交近一萬包、均在塲外交易、至華粉廠盤迄未變動、惟各廠以原料吿缺、已無法照常供應、聞此事尙在磋商中、又聞二十日左右將有巨額洋粉抵埠、共裝四十萬包左右、屆時粉價方可抑低云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日巿仍擯局、查　內外來源、一致稀少、日廠與華廠對於原料需要、莫不貪取、但終以無貨可收爲憾、聞昨日華廠收進中决麥二百餘包、價爲三十一元、高麥售價尙須提高、日廠門市收價尙未實放、故亦無貨可收、市面沉寂如故、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債續見上升</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨巿繼續上漲、丙種竟穿出四元、戊種亦穿出三元、人心激奮、散戶大爲補空、消息上幷無若何異動、不過信孚號忽由空而翻多、市况乃由軟弱而轉强、惟恐不能持久耳、昨日上午、信孚入手再行買進、由空翻多、而多方了結、乘機扳價、午前市價已高、午後信孚復又吸收、先後的計八十萬、二十五號買進的三十萬、永昌的進十餘萬、大都易中多頭了結听供、餘利潤利震長稍有賣出、結果續漲三四角、成交的二百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股　一百股、價爲十八元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤寗靜、後突轉堅、大衆對於鋼業股之買興特濃、該股開盤價祗卅二元七角半、開後逐步上漲以至三十六元半高價收盤、成交五萬六千股、其餘實業股亦俱有相當進展、橡皮股同被帶好、</p>
<p>倫　十七日（週一）電、今日中國外債及速東央商各公司股票掛牌行市、遠東股稍形活動、麥加利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價爲八鎊五先令、古拉客林傍橡皮股上升一先令三便士、價爲十五先令七使士半、其餘不動、</p>
<p>愛耶太華橡皮派息</p>
<p>華昌洋行經理之愛耶太華橡皮有限公司、截至一九四〇年九月底止一年度之末决股息、每股將派國幣一元二角、連已派中期息每股二角、共派國幣一元四角、第三十一决常年股東大會、定於十二月二十七日舉行、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬紗午後　又見新高價　一千三百四十八元</h3>
<p>上日轉跌之紗市、昨則又復回升、此神兎起　落之市面、使人捉摸不定、實則買進賣出、成交興繁之故也、就棉紗本身上着想、當可安穩、無奈雙馬紗投機者興緻濃厚，由此波浪起伏不一、至現紗三二支允爲俏俐二十支紗較還、然有人謂二十支雜牌紗價、較變馬爲廉也、今日有棉紗二百七十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日人氣衰頺、市象尙平淡、首槃價爲一千三百二十二元、開後微下至一千三百十八元、此時放空看小者頗不乏人、在一千三百十八元至二十三四元、往返有三次之多、旋聞外滙改縮、黃金上騰、一般小銀號打來之電、大都買進、自由空翻多、生大銀號一家獨拖有五六百包之巨、一時檯面較緊、一般望風追蹤跟進者、搶先收進、於是市勢從速回升、市盤越做越高、可說予昨日成一反比例、直升至一千三百三十九兀收盤、査牛日間成交統計五千一百二十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行四、八〇〇　香港　三二〇</p>
<p>統計五、一二〇</p>
<p>午後市面續昂、二十支雙馬始做一千三百四十一元、繼後做至一千三百四十七八元、成交的有一二百包、又發現新高峰</p>
<h3>印棉到五千件　津幫採辦長纖維棉</h3>
<p>現棉情况、依然寗靜、不及紗市之昂、此因棉市無投機出、外棉定價較爲合算、所以興奮性允爲淡漠也、而且廠皆無躉批的採辦也、</p>
<p>印棉大枇來滬、大英公司Santhia號前日由喀爾喀搭到埠、計裝來棉花五千一百七十五件、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紅約棉市稍呈活躍之狀、續後又因同業之購買、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲一二磅音、印度昨日無市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、天津方面頗有意購買長纖維之原棉、故客幫已在滬開始採購之說、然本埠廠方則購意殊呈淡屬之狀也、市上存底微薄、滙兌又趨緊縮、故棉市前途、可轉呈光明也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布午後激漲　尤以細布為甚</h3>
<p>廠布晨市平平、午後一致挺秀，乃因外滙趨緊、同業及囤戶又亟起搜雜廉額手貨、浮戶態度轉變、亦有揑進、故售盤重吿回振、粗細布斜紋漲每走二角半之譜、漂染布漲每疋二三角、廠方以原紗激漲、開價後市亦喊高　角半至五角、午前照上日原盤訂出頗多、</p>
<p>本街成交各布一千四五百件、粵港帮辦色布色斜漂布府綢等三百餘件、浙閩帮辦漂染布粗布等一百數十件、北路烟台帮辦重磅粗布現期貨一百餘件、國外新加坡等地辦漂染布印花布三千數百疋、今日有疋頭八百六十五件運香港、</p>
<p>東布昨以業內外逢小收進、巿氣又緊、晨開時龍頭細布三十七元三四角、賣出少而買進多、逐盤拉高至三十七元七角半、收盤四君千嗶嘰升至一元一角四分、中檔各脾細布脚地允堅、激漲五六角、</p>
<h3>油布　食油投機猖獗　—行情飛漲五六元—</h3>
<p>咋日油市因一般投機國戶、爲期貨結價無貨交解（仍有一部份未妥的二月份未決）之結果、故隔日已在吸收現油、致晨初開盤、市塲中已買氣充溢、其勢比上日更形猖獗、原因在供不應求之情况下、良以市價直綫奔騰、結果成交數量雖不多、但行情比上日飛漲五六元不等、計成交大連豆油七百桶、價詳市價欄、大有餘廠豆油六百担，烟歧豆油八十件、膠州豆油五十件、膠州生油二百件、新貨百餘件、路貨二十件、烟台生油六十件、聽裝油一千聽、靑島生油一百五十桶、又新貨五十桶、</p>
<p>十九日出口、有豆子一千一百五十包、豆餅二千五百五十塊、生仁二百五十包、生油三百二十聽、芝蔴三百五十包、蔴油二百五十聽、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>糖巿　糖價回鬆</h3>

<h3>金融述（續十六日）　聖凱瓊　—十二月十四日—</h3>
<p>但是這項修改，決不是日本戰時財政金融之福利。正是日本戰時財政余融日益崩潰而成紙幣小斷地膨脹的現象。按之法國的事實，因爲便利對政府貸款計，最高限制發行額每隨政府貸款額而增加，以致最先每年擴充最高限制發行額，以後則一年中要擴充好幾决。如一九一四年八月擴充爲一百二十萬萬法郞，一五年五月爲一百五十萬萬，一六年三月爲一百八十萬萬，一七年二月爲二百十萬萬，而九月爲二百四十萬萬，一八年三月爲二百七十萬萬，五月增爲三百萬萬，七月更增爲三百三十萬萬法郞。現在日本想規定逐年最大發行額，將來還不是和法國一九一四—一八年的一樣直錢上升去擴充最高限制發行額而何！</p>
<p>據日本金融界人士觀察：日本銀行今年底發行額將達四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，放在眼前的紙幣惡性膨脹不已底事實，仟何的高明的財政金融專家，都無法去變改掉的，除非放棄掉侵略的野心而後已！</p>
<h3>中國的直接稅</h3>
<p>在這一週中路透社一方面旣傳來日本財政金融無法的暗示，一方面又傳來中國反侵略的抗戰財政支柱的直接稅收情形。據稱：中國政府希望明年所得稅·利得稅·印花稅·遺產稅等直接稅稅收，共可收得一萬三千五百萬元，士地稅至少可收二萬萬元。又稱：本年到十一月二十八日爲止，所得稅收四千三百九十萬元，利得稅三千七百萬元，印花稅收四百七十萬元，遺產稅雖於七月一日開徵，已收二千七百元。近年來因爲軍事的理由，關於財政情形不大發表，致一般人對於中國戰時財政想加以研究的，都苦無適當的資料。筆者用於述評中介紹一些直接稅的近狀如後。</p>
<p>中國的直接稅的分上述的所得·利得·印花·遺產四稅，所得稅在戰事發生前卽一九三六年十月一日先行開始徵收第二類公務員薪給所得，和第三類公債利息所得二稅，至一九三七年一月一日再開徵第一類營利事業所得稅。非常時期過份利得稅則自一九三九年一月一日起徵。</p>
<p>所得稅實施以來，成績非常美滿。一九三六年度預算數爲五百萬元，實收數則超達六百四十萬元。三七年度預算數爲二千五百萬元，因爲八一三戰事爆發，中國在口岸僅有的工商業大遭破壞，而影響稅收，然而實收數仍有二千餘萬元，佔預算數八成以上。一九三八年度因中國財政年度改爲歷年制，僅有半年，預算數爲前年度的一半計一千二百五十寓元，實收數爲八百六十萬元，佔預算數七成。一九三九年預算數爲三千萬元，實收數超達三千二百萬元之多。一九四〇年預算數爲三千五百萬元，據路透社所傳則已超過的九百萬元了。現各項國稅收入中所得稅的發展，就預算數而論，已由一九三六年度的佔第六位躍升爲今年的第三位，而爲一九三六年的七倍。</p>
<p>直接稅中除所得稅佔第一位外，利得稅居其次，一九四〇年預算度是二千四百萬元，但因戰時物價飛漲，工商業無不賺錢，因之稅收旺盛，據路透社所傳則已超過的一千三自萬元了。</p>
<p>再决爲印花稅，一九四〇年預算爲一千餘萬元，遺產稅爲二百萬元，和預算數　較，差額尙多。遺產稅在今年七月，方始創辦，一時自然難期成效。至於印花稅的减　，大牛還是逃稅的關係，卽如上海各大公司和大商店，往往在發票上藉口一時印花的售完而加一「印花無從購貼」的戳子而逃稅。很希望各公司各商店能够明瞭國家减少一分稅卽减弱一分抗戰財力，而多增一分本身所遭剝削的痛苦，加以改善。</p>

<h3>看古文的態度</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>記得小時候「開蒙的孩子，第一天上學，家裹必須預備糖茶糕餅之類的東西，帶到先生「門館」裏去，先齋孔夫子，然後把申西分給同窗們，於是大家就熟識了。雖然，我沒向經過這種「儀式」的「洗禮」，但在我們故鄉的「村塾」裏，却至今還在飾行着。而開始念的書，也無非是「神童詩」，「千字文」，「三字經」「百家姓」之類，所以祇要是跨巡學堂門的孩子沒有一個不知道孔夫子的。因此，也就雖怪人們要說「孔子之前，無一孔子：孔子之後，有無數的孔子」了。</p>
<p>可是爲什麼我們談古文要扯到孔子呢？無疑地，孔子是中國古文學的權威，是封建文化的代表，因此，我們談古文，也就不能和孔子完全脫離關係，換句話說，居現在而談古文，也就應該注章當時的社會狀態。而中國目前的社會經濟結構，則已經是處於資本主義性的半封建的情况之下，同樣的，以經濟條件爲基礎的政治形態，也還沒有跳出這圈子。因此表現在文化領域裏的現象也就有着這種共同的傾向。所以，在經濟基礎尙未改善，政治制度沒有刷新之前，封建文化也就沒法連根拔除。何况還有人至今還在高唱「復古」一讀經」聲中來「明哲保身」，而在「開倒車」的火熖上「澆油」呢。</p>
<p>但這，我們並不是說「古文無用」，而是說古文不能適用於大衆。至於少數人的專門研究，我們也並不反對。同時，也不是說我們應該消極，應該閉着嘴不說話，話是還得說的，除非到了被迫弊做啞吧的時候。其實，卽使音啞了，手勢還可以裝的，嘴唇還會動的，所以，我們還得在積極上而着想，—怎樣來創造我們的時代所需要的新文化，這是我們年靑人的責任，這也就是說怎樣來發揮文化本身的獨特性，—擔負起時代角號的責任，而來推動政治制度的前進和幫助經濟條件的改善，兩者間是起着相互作用的！</p>
<p>同樣的，我們在今天來要理解古文，理解孔子的學說，也就應該有着兩個堅定的立塲：第一，是我們應該淸楚地來認識孔子產生的時代，和我們所處的時代的相異，孔子的時代是封建經濟正在成熟的時代，—春秋　國時代—所以當時的文化也需要推進至於　經濟形態相適應的　階段，孔子在當時是一位偉大的文化工作者，他盡了偉大的任務，使封建文化奠定了完備的形式。目前中國已由抗戰的烽火把半封建的社會推進至於新民主主義的時代，於是在文化部門上也需要推進至於、　進的階段。因此，目前文化工作者的任務，就在努方創造新民主主義的新文化，使與抗建的大時代互相適應，這種文化的創造工作，可說是孔子與現代文化工作者異代同調之處。如果現在我們仍是一味地墨守舊章，保持封建文化的舊形態—高唱「讀經」等等—在形式上似平尊重了孔子，而實際却大大地違反了孔子的精神，而把孔子當做「偶像」看待。反之，如果我們不墨守舊章，創造適應於新時代需要的新文化，那末，在形式上似乎是與孔子背道而馳，但是實際上却眞正與孔子的精神相吻合的。</p>
<p>第二，我們應該用發展的而不是死板板的眼光來看孔子的學說，用理智的批評來接受歷史的「遺產」把優良的予以保留或發揚，（假如値得發揚的話），把有害的就乾脆地予以拋棄這是不値得有所留戀的。至於想抬出孔子的遺敎，而以片言隻語來當做敎訓大衆的內容，那不過是一種淺薄的嘗試，與發揚孔子精神全無關係，同時也不適合目前中國的需要。如果把孔子當做中國歷史上的傀儡，來實施奴化敎育，那不但是曲解了孔子，簡直還汚蔑了孔子，成爲孔子的罪人。</p>
<p>因此，在今天而想把當時的古文原原本本地來「翻一下版」，而施行奴化敎育，這用心是毒辣的，但目前已經看到的「借屍還魂」的事實，却一天天在伸張，所以，在令天來說一下我們對古文，對孔子學說應有的立塲和應取的態度，我想決不是件無意義的事情。</p>

<p>天如很得意地笑道：「這是他們自己的天才，小弟伺功之有？今得尙書一言，如登龍門，聲價十倍，還要請尙醫惠賜數　詩給他們，以爲光寵。」錢牧齋微微笑道：「方纔已胡亂謅了數首，明天待我再送幾首詞吧。」柳如是遂將牧齋寫的詩奉給張天如讀，天如朗聲而吟，擊節嘆賞道：「自是李杜手筆，他人爲之擱筆了。「柳氏姊妹又各歌一曲，直飲至夜深人靜，酒闌炧燈，方纔散席，各賦歸去。决日牧齋又造如是粧閣，把幾首新詞給柳如是，柳如是不勝欣謝。陪着錢牧齋，談些古往今來，深佩牧齋經史淵博，有許多啟發，是伊聞所未聞的。少停，　毓祺又來告訴柳如是說，石達業已由他修亟　　書信，交他帶去金陵見侯方域，再托侯方域修函，打發石達携書赴武昌，投奔左良玉麾—立功，並贈盤纏二十兩。石達已動身，托他轉言，不再來辭別了。柳如是聽了這消息，心頭上放下一事。這晚叉陪着錢黃二人在粧閣中　飲。別的客人沒有邀請絳子也出外去侑酒，三個人且飲且談，各吐胸肊，二更過後，黃毓祺欲歸去。綫牧齋對於柳如是一見傾心，嬾嬾地不肯起身。柳如是心裏未嘗不覺得可是伊已有陳臥子縈　懷抱，對錢牧齋祇有敬意而尙無愛心。牧齋見柳如是無何表示，知道伊是有聲價的名伎，自己雖然愛伊，若要得到美人的靑眼，也不是一朝一夕之爭，所以他只得和黃毓祺吿別而去。睠踡之意，連徐大娘也看出來了。徐大娘知道錢牧齋是貴人，和張　如叉是不同，伊很希望如是可以嫁得一個金龜婿，自己好得到一筆鉅貲，爲養老之計。但柳如是芳心却仍繫戀在陳臥子的身上。伊雖是墮溷之花，而天生慧質，素重名節，慕斯文，是個很有氣骨的女子。錢牧齋釗了松陵，迭來兩次，詩酒流速，對於伊不可謂不悄有所鍾。錢牧齋的文章父是伊素所欽佩的，因此芳心百轉，要試試陳臥子對伊究竟可有眞心與否，遂想出一條滑稽突梯的奇計來，作陳臥子的試金石。　（十四）</p>

<h3>從「孔夫子」學習</h3>
<p>— 江城</p>
<p>「孔夫子」影片給予我們超水準的滿足。孔子留給我們超時代的敎訓。沒有人能够擺脫時間和空間的的束，但偉大的哲人嘗有知覺的先能。</p>
<p>我們不能自知二千叫百多年後的人，對我們作何感想：我們不能在目前去做二千四百年以後的「完人」。同樣地，我們不能完全用現代的尺度，衡量二千四百年前的孔夫子。以人類進步之驚奇的速度而言，生於今日的我們，實在渺小得可以，薄弱得可以。如果對二千多年前的孔夫子有着無盡的要求，該是過份的奢望。</p>
<p>我們對孔子的一切，也不能盲目的接受，正和我們不同情一般「熱情的幼稚病」者，來盲目的打倒孔家店一樣。</p>
<p>我們所以敬仰孔夫子的，是因爲他是一個大哲人，而不是因爲他是一個大政治家，假如我們問：「爲甚麽孔子不領導民衆去打倒專制君王」的話，還不如問一句：「孔子富時爲甚麼不提倡工業革命？」中華民國之建立，究竟燙是二十九年前的事。</p>
<p>後代人把孔子「抑揚曲解，毀譽利用。」不知到了甚麽程度，我們不應該再存有「利用」的念頭，應該去理解去研究這一位先哲，大學者，究竟比盲目的去捧某些名人來得有價値些。</p>
<p>孔子雖然自己承認在政治上失敗了，然而只是戰略上的失敗，（希特勒是戰略上的勝和者，還有……）他幾决想借叛亂的政機，來推行仁義之道，然也只是「子欲往」，而不曾往，不能只問目的，不問手段的自忘其本。同時在他爲中都宰爲司空爲司寇的當兒，也還有若干百姓從而爲善的政績。因爲他總是「仁義爲本」，所以諸侯們聽了才會倦然欲睡，假如他說：「可爲我公一戰而定天下」，諸侯們老早跳起來了。不過，對於「却强敵，誅奸亂，」他的手段也就够辣了。</p>
<p>「精誠所至，金石爲開。」一種奮不顧身的精神，可以產生意想不到的力量。正如一個士兵在戰塲上殺死若干敵人，空手奪取機關槍一樣，做出不可能的事業時，主宰的常是精神的力量。我們不能否定孔子精神上的訓示。</p>
<p>在匡受匡人之攻，在宋受宋人之攻，在魯不能用，在衛不能用。去鄭不能入，夫晋不能入，伐樹示危，絕糧陳蔡。孔夫子奔走一生，固然沒有顯著的成就，然而孔子始終不屈，旣未　殺害，也不因凍餓而死。雖然道貌岸然，有些討厭，然而「死不免　」「不正不坐」究竟算不得甚麼壞事。</p>
<p>用影片，尤其戲劇式的影片來表示一個哲人或發明家的事以，常常只能神似，眞的要闡釋學說，不如捨影片而就書本了。看過「幼年」和「偉人安迪生」還是不知道軍燈原理；看過「萬古流芳」，不明白巴士德的痘苗怎一回事；看過　慾海慈航」，對「神彈」原理還是照舊糊塗，原不是希奇的事。對孔夫子影片，同樣不能有過份的要求。然而，唯有優秀的作品，才値得嚴正的批評，才値得寄予未來的希望，我們不該放過欣賞孔夫子的機會，更不應該放棄批評的責任，但一切嚴正向上的東西，自會牛出一種敬愛之心，正同我們厭惡卑鄙下流的東西一樣。</p>
<h3>「孔夫子」影片之製制</h3>
<p>— 費穆</p>
<p>—關於演員之部</p>
<p>「孔夫子」影片値得　述之一點，是演員的出色。這是上海劇人羣的榮譽，而不是我的自傲。站在一個導演者的立塲上，爲了避嫌，不便盡情地頌讀他們；但這在觀衆，自會感覺到的。</p>
<p>除了數年來共患難的舊時聯華同志，像張翼先生，司馬英才先生，裴冲先生等之外，我們得到：</p>
<p>上海劇藝社的徐立先生和慕容婉兒小姐；新藝的陳琦小姐和屠光啓，錢殺兩先生；中旅的唐槐秋先生和李景波，葛鑫，吳景平，湯琦諸位先生；以及許多位熱心的同道的參加。使一孔夫子」影片的演員陣錢，盡共一時之選，實非始料所及。</p>
<p>憑着什麼力最會得到這樣廣大的同情的支撑，眞是令人感奮。而且，不但是參加了工作的，其餘求參加的朋友在一孔夫子」拍最後一塲戲之前，還有好幾位來問我：「你還需要人嗎？」</p>
<p>不計酬報，還不過是藝人的本色，但他們甚至不爭角色，不論名决，不問劇情，不問戲之多少，完全地信任了我。他們都是忙人，但令天通知，明天準到，這樣的工作態度，眞是罕見。這樣的熱情，叫我怎樣來回答？</p>
<p>在孔夫子」的劇中人物表上，他們都是演員之一。如果按照通常的稱呼，每一個都是客串一。推其是他們爲了工作而工作，個個是百分之百的盡職的演員——「演員」兩字，當之而無愧。如果稱之爲「客串」，反是商業化了的噱頭」。是一種對於藝人的侮辱。</p>
<p>爲了劇本的限制，沒有使他們得到盡量　揮演技的機會，誠是遺憾。特別是對於慕容婉兒，陳琦兩位小姐。</p>
<p>「孔夫子」的製作時間過長，好多位的銀幕作品（初决的），已在若干後「孔夫子一而拍的影片中先行演出，他們的犬才和演技，都已得到了證實。這稍可掩蓋我的罪愆。</p>
<p>有一件事使我十分興奮。這次參加的劇人什九都是初决嘗試，而所表現的優異成績，絕不護於斵輪老手。在另一面，張翼，司馬央才，裴冲諸先生在劇人同伴之前，又毫不示弱，毫無遜色，不愧是一明星」。這樣的合作和協調，前此所未有。</p>
<p>徐立，屠光啟，李景波三位先生在攝演時，還不時啓發我修正對白，至可感謝。</p>
<p>關於唐槐秋先生：他已將想像中的孔子，塑成一個有生命，有血肉，有性格的與塑人物。單是先後三十多决，每次六小時的化裝，那種忠於藝術的靱性和毅力，已足爲演劇家的楷模。</p>
<p>最後，我得感謝所有的演員，其中包括素來不被重視的「臨時演員」。所謂「臨時演員」，不過是他們的名字不在任何影片公司的薪水册上而已；他們之中，不乏眞才。在「孔夫子」裏，有若干塲戲，完全是「臨時演員」做的戲，這是我故　設計的，我相信觀衆是辨不出的。</p>
<p>請恕我沒有說一句批判演員的話。事實上，整個影片是演員做出來的，能够逃得出誰的眼請呢？</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Formally Announces US to Prepare to Expand Aid; Draft Plan Readied to Present to Congress for Supplying Large Quantities of War Material to Britain</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the US government is currently considering manufacturing even greater quantities of military equipment for loan to Britain. The President stated, "Britain's resistance is, in fact, the best defense for the United States. Therefore, it is better to give US military equipment to Britain for their use than to store it in the US; its effect will be more substantial." When a reporter inquired about Secretary of State Hull's statement that "the first half of 1941 will be the most dangerous period for Britain," President Roosevelt only stated that the government would make continuous efforts to accelerate its large-scale military equipment manufacturing plan. At the same time, it would also awaken the efforts of the populace. There are currently two or three instances where factories manufacturing defense products are not fully cooperating with the government, so the government is studying whether to take over those factories. However, the President stated that, under the current circumstances, there is no need to declare a national emergency, only to see if the country can accelerate military equipment production. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt, yesterday, outlined to reporters his plan for leasing war materials to Britain, saying that this plan would both aid Britain and strengthen US defenses. He plans to present it to the new Congress on January 3rd. According to this plan, the US can take over Britain's future orders for war materials in the US, and then lease the manufactured goods to Britain when the orders are completed. After the war ends, if the borrowed war materials are still intact, Britain will return them to the US; otherwise, they will compensate for them. A reporter asked if this approach would easily draw the US into the war. The President replied that this would definitely not happen. The President also stated that this plan is still being studied from a legal point of view. Whether the ownership of the planes, cannons, and ships transported to Britain should remain with the US or be temporarily transferred to Britain is a legal challenge, but this is only a minor matter inevitable in the US's major aid plan for Britain. The entire matter will be handled on the basis that the US must aid Britain in its fight for self-defense. As for the issue of accelerating domestic production, Britain's orders for war materials are a good tool to promote the necessary expansion of US production. The plan he is proposing is the newest stage in the process of aiding Britain short of entering the war. Although legislation is necessary, it will not involve amendments or repeals of the Neutrality Act. There has recently been considerable discussion about providing financial aid to Britain. As far as humanity knows, the outcome of major wars throughout history has never been determined by the amount of money. Money is necessary for victory in this war, but the path to victory is not solely based on that. Why do people speak of this problem with trivial and mediocre arguments, or hold the view that the only way to aid Britain is to repeal the law so that money can be supplied to Britain for use in the US? It should be known that this kind of view can be described as narrow and constricted. Direct cash donations may be beneficial, but he cannot confirm that they are necessary. The President also said that Britain's orders in the US are a tremendous asset for the US because they result in the convenience of adding factories, munitions plants, and shipyards. The new plan he is proposing has been under consideration for three or four weeks. This is one of the various plans that can be considered. Since the types of military equipment ordered by Britain are the same as those used by the US, Britain's orders can be converted to ones that the US has sufficient funds to handle. He believes that Britain is capable of paying for the goods it has already ordered in the US. As for this new approach, it only focuses on future orders. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>US Deeply Feels Need to Aid Britain, May Revise Johnson Act</p>
<p>Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the House Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday that unless Britain's economic aid is guaranteed, Britain will not be able to order additional war materials from the US. According to a key member of the committee, Morgenthau's attitude is that Congress should address the issue of economic aid to Britain, but he did not propose a plan. Several congressional leaders said that they will request the amendment or repeal of the "Johnson Act" when Congress convenes in January next year to make it easier to provide aid to Britain again. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – The urgent need to accelerate US war material production and rapidly increase aid to Britain has now become the most important issue in Washington. President Roosevelt's return to the White House from his inspection in the West Indies was welcomed by US newspapers, expressing concern about the current situation and strongly arguing the urgency of the situation. The most recent development yesterday was Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement to news reporters that the British have indicated that unless the US provides financial assistance, Britain will no longer be able to purchase war materials in the US. Morgenthau also repeatedly stated that the US can only make loans to Britain if Congress amends or repeals the Johnson Act. Morgenthau's words gave listeners the impression that this decision rests entirely with Congress. It is reported that Morgenthau only analyzed Britain's needs in terms of facts and did not express any opinions. At the same time, it is also reported that Secretary of State Hull has stated to the Defense Committee and other government officials that if the current quantity of US war material supplies is not greatly increased, Britain may encounter difficulties next spring. Hull advocates speeding up the manufacture of military aircraft and other supplies. It is heard that the US authorities are currently investigating the shipping situation to determine whether more merchant ships can be dispatched to transport war materials to Britain. A Washington newspaper published a two-column article stating that the US will exert all its great activity to deal with national defense difficulties. In addition to repealing the Johnson Act, the US has many ways to financially aid Britain, such as purchasing raw materials in the British Empire market at higher prices and purchasing British-owned interests in the US. Landon, the Republican candidate for 1936, yesterday expressed his impressions of his visit to Washington in Topeka, Kansas, saying that he had heard and witnessed reliable aspects of the official circles, but Hitler intends to invade England in mid-February, and he felt that the Washington administration was quite anxious and uneasy about the US's failure to adjust its national defense activities. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The "Hochi Shimbun" today commented on the proposal made by US New York Democratic Congressman Bloom on Sunday regarding amending the US Neutrality Act.

It also stated that this amendment, in terms of the Sino-Japanese War, will also have an indirect and broad impact. The newspaper stated that Japan should closely monitor any actions by the US that may be unfavorable to Japan. (Taichung News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>Vichy Bows to Others; Laval Back in Favor; German Spies Demand Expansion of Territory Occupied; French Cabinet Holds Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Vichy – An official announcement stated that French Head of State Marshal Pétain received former Foreign Minister and Vice-Premier Laval at 8:18 PM last night to discuss the general political situation. Laval was dismissed last Saturday and, at the request of the German Ambassador to France, Abetz, is no longer subject to surveillance by French police. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Pétain Received German Ambassador Abetz the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Vichy – Yesterday afternoon, the official report here on German Ambassador to Paris Abetz's visit to Vichy stated that German Ambassador Abetz arrived in Vichy on the night of the 16th. Marshal Pétain received him at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Marshal Pétain also hosted a luncheon for Abetz at noon, inviting Navy Minister Admiral Darlan, Army Minister General Huntziger, and Minister without Portfolio Baudouin to accompany them. It is also learned that when Marshal Pétain received Abetz yesterday morning, former Associate Premier and Foreign Minister Laval, who has now been dismissed, was also present. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Demands for Expansion of Occupied Territory Will Be a Future Challenge</p>
<p>Vichy – The dismissed French Deputy Premier Laval returned to Vichy last night. Laval has apparently been treated favorably by the French government and regained his freedom through significant pressure from Germany. Hitler's confidant, German Ambassador to France Abetz, has set off for Paris and will report on the "general situation" to Hitler by phone. Although this general situation is extremely chaotic and unclear due to numerous rumors and strict censorship, Germany's use of pressure on France is becoming increasingly apparent. A brief government communiqué stated that Laval, Marshal Pétain, German Ambassador Abetz, French Navy Chief Darlan, Army Chief Huntziger, and former Foreign Minister Baudouin jointly held a meeting. According to the London Daily Telegraph, the German ultimatum demanding an expansion of the occupied area will likely be issued after Laval's release. (International News Service, 18th)</p>
<p>Pétain's Policies May Not Be Able to Be Implemented</p>
<p>London – A telegram from the German border of non-occupied France stated that the dismissal of Vichy's former Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Laval seems to be primarily due to domestic policies, but the Vichy dispatch has not fully clarified the reasons. Laval tried to make Vichy Premier Marshal Pétain an instrument of his pro-German policies, or has encountered strong opposition, and this opposition has become stronger due to the changes in the Mediterranean situation. It is heard that Laval presented a proposal for a wide-ranging internal reorganization and a new peace proposal from the German side to the Vichy cabinet last week, all of which were rejected. Afterwards, Pétain received Laval. It is widely speculated that Pétain intended to adopt a more honorable policy than Laval and was determined not to agree to hand over French colonial bases to German control. However, British victories in the Mediterranean have allowed a faction led by Vichy Navy Chief Admiral Darlan to rise again. The hope of a separate Franco-German peace settlement is based on the fact that Italy has become much weaker. France may now be able to persuade Germany to cancel most of its demands on France, and the obstacles that previously deadlocked Franco-German negotiations may be removed. Since Laval's policies have completely failed, Vichy's new Foreign Minister Flandin will have to carefully consider how to handle these matters. German special envoy Abetz's visit to Vichy shows that Germany is not completely satisfied with Flandin's appointment as Foreign Minister. There are even rumors that Germany may feel the need to send troops to occupy Lyon. Judging from dispatches from Italy, the Italians' growing anxiety about the war is increasing day by day. For example, there are widespread rumors in Italy that former Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio and other generals have been shot for treason. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Laval and Pétain Quarrel; Imprisoned in Ancient Castle for Three Days</p>
<p>New York – The United Press received a secret European report that French Premier Pétain strongly denounced Deputy President Laval for conspiring to seize control of the remaining French government. Therefore, he forced him to draft his own resignation in front of the cabinet meeting. In this tense scene, the 84-year-old general and the dark-faced deputy premier glared at each other. Soon after, Laval was placed under house arrest by the police. It was not until yesterday that he regained his freedom with the intervention of the German ambassador and consulted with Marshal Pétain again. It is heard that Laval was plotting to assume the position of Premier. After Laval stepped down, his office was searched by the police, and a large number of special police were on guard around the Park Hotel where the government was located. Secret police led by Chief of Police Magnan secretly opened the door and took Laval to his private castle 20 miles away, where he was locked up with his wife and daughters. Armed guards stood watch outside the castle for three days. As for Flandin, Marshal Pétain had asked him ten days ago whether he would be willing to succeed Laval if Laval resigned. Flandin then consulted the German side, and the result was favorable. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<h3>Asahi Shimbun on Japan-Soviet Fishery Agreement</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Today's editorial in Asahi Shimbun urges the government to conclude a long-term basic fishery agreement with the Soviet Union within one year in accordance with Article 2 of last year's Japan-Soviet provisional fishery agreement. It is claimed that the new fishery agreement should aim to obtain fishing rights and stabilize fishery management. Concluding a long-term fishery agreement on an equal basis will be more helpful than anything else to improving the current Soviet-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Chronic Thai-Vietnamese Dispute</h3>
<p>The territorial dispute between Thailand and Vietnam has been marked by armed conflict since late last month, lasting almost a month. During this period, major international changes have included the waning of Axis power, the strengthening of British and American aid to China against Japan, and the recent changes in the French political situation. However, none of these seem to affect the hostile actions between Thailand and Vietnam. Although it has not yet evolved into a large-scale formal war, it is still developing. Aside from the British-Greek-German-Italian war in Europe and Africa and the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East, it has already formed a state of localized chronic ailment. It has recently been reported that a Vietnamese "Restoration Army," armed and equipped under the wing of a certain party, has been discovered in southern Guangxi, and internal turmoil has repeatedly occurred in Vietnam, further increasing the complexity and precariousness of the situation in the Indochinese Peninsula. If this continues, whether this spark will spread into a prairie fire is difficult to say. However, in today's precarious situation in the Far East, one cannot but regard this as a most worrying and unfortunate state. As for Thailand and Vietnam themselves, each lacks sufficient conditions for warfare, and the focus of their dispute has been a problem for four or five decades, with no new factors requiring immediate resolution. However, in fact, developments are creating a long-standing dispute during this unusually turbulent time in the Far East. This is固 Thailand's vigorous implementation of nationalism and France's weakening national strength after the war, but it ultimately makes it difficult to understand what the purpose of those promoting this dispute is. Of course, the instigation of ambition is one of the driving forces, and looking at Thailand's movements, it seems that they do not dare to deeply trust this external assistance. If the Axis powers had not suffered successive setbacks in Europe and Africa, resulting in those who were prepared to echo them to disrupt the overall situation in the Far East losing their foothold, it is hard to imagine what the state of Thailand and Vietnam, and even the entire Southeast Asia, would be. The most peculiar thing is that the authorities in Thailand and Vietnam, at this difficult time, cannot seem to understand this, and only focus on the territorial disputes of small gains, leading to a situation where they are locked in a stalemate that will lead to war. They seem to be blind to the arrival of a real crisis; they even want to use the help of ambitious people to elevate themselves, or even want them to mediate. There is no greater ignorance or foolishness. According to recent news, the 方 authorities have both shown a tendency to hope for a peaceful resolution, but there is no sign of mutual compromise. Moreover, the French and Vietnamese authorities claim that they will severely retaliate against Thai military incursions, while the Thai side has stated that it will not cease its actions until equal treatment is fully eliminated. In this situation, it is still difficult to expect negotiations to achieve anything quickly.</p>
<p>All the direct and indirect troubles in the South China Sea are caused by Japan's southward policy, but the current international situation is clearly unfavorable to large-scale adventures. On the other hand, it will inevitably intensify the creation or seeking of exploitable opportunities to realize its ambitions. Events such as the Thai-Vietnamese war and the various turmoils within Vietnam are perfectly suited to this requirement. In Vietnam, although its northern part is now under its control, that can only be regarded as a preliminary preparation for achieving the ambitious country's goals. Because this northern part alone does not have much military value in advancing south. Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon are its important targets that it will not let go. Because these two strongholds are like the heart of the South China Sea, enough to be linked with Haiphong, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, forming the forefront base for advancing south. Recent Thai-Vietnamese military operations are all in the lower Mekong River area, which can easily affect the entire southern part of Vietnam. If Japan's wishes are fulfilled, the offensive and defensive situation in the South China Sea will be completely changed, and the threat to the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya will be even more serious. Therefore, the Thai-Vietnamese issue must not be ignored as a mere spark.</p>
<p>This newspaper recently discussed the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, pointing out that the difficulty of achieving a compromise lies in the lack of a compromise focus between the parties, and secondly, the absence of international pressure that can be used. Unfortunately, this situation has not improved to date. However, the current problem is not only whether a Thai-Vietnamese compromise is possible in terms of the objective situation, but in order to ensure the peace of the South China Sea and the entire Southeast Asia, the crisis in the Indochinese Peninsula must be eliminated. If this task cannot be achieved, then the defense of Southeast Asia will be doubly difficult. British and American countries, for fear of harming the vase, are afraid of creating the result of driving fish into the deep. Therefore, they are unwilling to participate in it and engage in mediation, but letting it develop naturally is even more inadvisable. Of course, arbitration of this dispute is extremely difficult. At the very least, gentle advice should be given to both parties, and guarantees should be provided to reserve this territorial dispute for a reasonable resolution after the restoration of the international order in the future. Although the current Thai and Vietnamese authorities' expressions of hope for a peaceful resolution are weak, they should be regarded as the budding of remorse and should be strongly encouraged to promote their further awareness. In light of the current situation, the difficult problem faced by both Thailand and Vietnam is by no means the territorial issues between them, but the ambitions of third countries. With the richness and strategic position of the Vietnamese-Thai peninsula, it already has the conditions for ordinary people to possess valuable treasures, let alone fighting each other? In addition to earnestly hoping that the Thai people will be aware of the perilousness of their situation and the futility of relying on the fisherman's advantage, it is also hoped that the French and Vietnamese authorities will understand that the Thai demand for land is actually the result of previous concessions by France and Vietnam to Japan. If France and Vietnam cannot firmly resist and reject Japan's harsh demands, then even if they use force against Thailand, they will not be able to subdue the Thai people and prevent them from despising them. It is not too late to mend the fold now, but it depends on the skillful management of those involved.</p>
<h3>The Northwest Provinces: Political and Economic Situation is Optimistic; Muslims Will Definitely Cooperate Closely with the Central Government; Central Government Officials Strive to Avoid Friction with the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Recently, a certain person traveled extensively through the northwest provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Henan, and has now arrived in Chongqing. He is very optimistic about the political, economic, and military situation in the northwest provinces. He said that Muslims can now be assured of close cooperation with the central government. This is due to the political achievements of General Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Forces in the four provinces of Gansu, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Qinghai. The Muslim leaders General Ma Bufang, Ma Buqing, and Ma Hongkui have all assured Zhu that they will give their utmost assistance. The northwestern part of Gansu Province, formerly garrisoned by the Communist army, no longer has any Communist Party presence and is now entirely governed by the central government. The northwest highway from Gansu to Xinjiang is in good condition and is currently maintained by the military for transportation. Although there is no fixed schedule for military supplies transported from the Soviet Union, all goods transported are strictly guarded by the government authorities. The highway connecting Xinjiang to the Chinese Communist Party is also managed by the government authorities. According to this traveler, the Soviet Union will certainly not help the Chinese Communist Party to overthrow the central government, because the Soviet Union deeply understands that China will be an important player in future international developments. As long as the Kuomintang is in power, the Soviet Union will continue to assist the Nationalist government. Although central government personnel in the northwest are striving to avoid friction with the Communist Party in Shaanxi and other places, the central government authorities are neither arrogant nor humble towards the Communist Party and are determined not to make any concessions. General Yan Xishan was finally able to completely eliminate the pro-Communist elements under his command. Although the central government has offered Yan a high position, it is said that Yan replied that he must recover the land of his province before he can accept the position from the central government, and is currently residing in his province, leading troops in combat. With a large army stationed in the northwest, the residents can rely on peace and stability, which can both prevent the Japanese army from invading and prevent internal disturbances from occurring. The Longhai Railway in Baoji is only 600 meters away from the Japanese artillery positions, but it is still operating as usual. The residents of Chongqing treat the Japanese bombing as routine, and their nerves can be said to be as strong as steel. However, the residents of Baoji have been subjected to Japanese air raids for several days, as well as artillery and machine gun fire from the Japanese army on the opposite bank of the Yellow River, and they are still living their lives peacefully. Their nerves are even better than those of the residents of Chongqing. The Chinese army guarding the Yellow River has very high morale. According to one soldier, they have been preventing the Japanese army from crossing the river for three years now, and even after another three years, the Japanese army will still not be able to fly across. Elite Chinese troops are now being sent continuously into the occupied areas of the Yangtze River basin and various places on the southern bank of the Yellow River, and are consolidating the positions in the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.

<h3>British Forces Adopt Encirclement Strategy, Launch Full-Scale Offensive on Bardia; Free French Forces Fight Shoulder-to-Shoulder with British, Encountering Stiff Resistance from Blackshirt Troops</h3>
<p>London – According to a telegram received here yesterday, a large number of British infantry, artillery, tanks, and mechanized units are currently advancing on Bardia and have approached the coastal road, the only route for Italian supplies and reinforcements. British bombers are heavily bombarding Bardia in four waves, aiming to isolate the city and assist ground forces in clearing nearby areas. British forces are reenacting the encirclement strategy used to capture Sidi Barrani and Sollum. However, Bardia's defenses are stronger than those of any other city, making it seem less easily breached than the previous two locations. It is believed that the Italian troops stationed in Bardia include remnants of the 62nd and 63rd Divisions that escaped from Egypt, as well as some Blackshirt units retreating from Sidi Barrani. Currently, British forces have a significant advantage in this operation: they can readily increase troop reinforcements at any time, while the Italians' only lifeline is the road to Tobruk. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Cairo – British mechanized units, in high spirits, are continuing their advance toward Bardia with great speed. Following closely behind is a continuous stream of infantry, mostly traveling in captured Italian trucks. Fierce fighting is occurring in the Bardia area of Libya. The leading elements of the British mechanized forces, after fighting their way across the desert, are now pressing against the Bardia port defense lines. The vanguard of the British infantry is also advancing with the mechanized units. Since breaching the Italian Libyan border, British forces have used rapid assault tactics to seize three border forts within Italian territory. On the right flank of the front lines, the Free French forces are providing valuable assistance to the British Empire forces. The French forces demonstrated their bravery during the last attack on Sollum. Although French tactics differ significantly from those of the British, months of arduous training have transformed the French into a skilled fighting force, now fighting alongside their British comrades. The rapid British progress is almost unbelievable, but it would be a serious error to conclude that the Italian forces are not resisting. Initially, the British attack caught the Italians by surprise, leaving them with no time or opportunity to resist. However, according to reliable information from wounded soldiers fighting near the border, the Italian forces, now having had ample time to prepare their defenses, are putting up a very determined fight. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Cairo – British forces yesterday drove the last of the Italian troops out of Egypt and are closing in on Bardia, near the Libyan border. British infantry and mechanized units are launching a major offensive against Inez Sidi Omar and Saffa, destroying enemy resistance south of Bardia to pave the way for an attack on the coastal city. The Italian forces initially offered considerable resistance along the various lines, but once these were cleared, British forces encountered no further resistance and reached the defensive perimeter four or five miles from Bardia. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Royal Air Force Demonstrates Power</p>
<p>Cairo – The British Air Force Headquarters announced that British aircraft on Sunday bombed Italian airfields along the Libyan coast from Bardia to Tobruk, dropping over twelve bombs on Italian army camps and railways in Bardia, causing major fires. It also stated that the damage in various Italian Libyan locations such as Tobruk, Bomba, Bena, Aden, El Gubs, and El Gazala, was extremely heavy. British aircraft shot down eight Italian aircraft. In addition, ten No. 42 aircraft and five No. 79 aircraft captured at Sollum had already been damaged and rendered unusable during previous British bombing raids. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Cairo – The British Air Force Command announced last night that British aircraft, braving adverse weather, heavily bombed Durazzo, a key port in Albania. Bombs hit the dockyard area, causing explosions. All British aircraft returned safely. Also, Gura and Asmara in Italian East Africa were bombed by British aircraft on the night of December 15. After the attack on Gura, flames soared high. One British bomber was damaged by enemy fighters but managed to fly back to British territory. In Asmara, a factory and a transportation depot were bombed. In addition, enemy bombers attacked Port Sudan four times, but no British Air Force buildings or private residences were damaged. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Account of the Fall of the Sollum Fortress</p>
<p>Cairo – A Reuters correspondent wired from Sollum in the western desert, reporting that yesterday, British infantry prepared to cross the border into Libya to participate in the major offensive. In recent days, they had pursued Italian forces out of Egyptian territory, and by the time they captured Sollum on Sunday, they were quite exhausted. However, the victorious army advanced with great momentum. Sollum is just a small port, surrounded by a few white houses. Upstream from the port is Upper Sollum, which formerly housed an Egyptian army camp, but the camp had been bombed by the British when it was occupied by Italian forces. In recent days, reporters and several interviewers, along with one American, observed the battle in Sollum as the British offensive on Sollum reached its final stages. The tactical planning was very thorough. A week earlier, a British armored division captured another destination and then stormed through Buq Buq, and Sollum was first alerted. At that time, General Annibale Bergonzoli and his Catanzaro Division officers and soldiers were en route to Sidi Barrani to relieve the troops. They thought that the war was still far away, but they did not expect the British forces to arrive in an instant, catching them completely by surprise and unprepared, so that most of the soldiers were captured, and all their materials were scattered along the road and seized by the British. When the British forces attacked Sollum, they advanced on several routes at the same time. Tanks bombarded the Italian forces guarding Sollum with heavy artillery fire. The British Air Force also bombed non-stop. Some tanks became bogged down in the sand for a time, causing the British advance to slow down slightly. At the same time, an infantry brigade also moved forward, ordered not to formally attack Sollum but to carry out a feinting action, preventing any Italian soldiers from escaping. By Sunday, the Sollum garrison, seeing that their situation was critical, moved to the top of the slope and destroyed the road. British infantry braved the Italian artillery fire on the slope and captured Lower Sollum. That afternoon, the Italian forces on the slope surrendered. The British were preparing to accommodate the Italian prisoners of war captured at Sollum at Buq Buq, which was completed by Sunday. More than 12,000 Italian prisoners of war were issued water when they set off. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>What Was Seen Along the Desert Battlefield</p>
<p>London – A Reuters correspondent wired from the western desert, reporting that when Italian forces invaded Egypt months ago, they built a road from the Libyan border to Sidi Barrani. The reporter recently traveled along this road and saw stones commemorating Mussolini planted all along the way, as well as a monument erected before the road was built, inscribed with the words, "The 12th Artillery Squadron, under enemy plots and the fierce sun and wind, built this road connecting the sands of Libya and Egypt." Although this road has not yet been paved with asphalt, it has become a British line of communication for the offensive against Libya and is of no small use. Buq Buq itself has only one isolated house and several Italian water troughs, currently guarded by British sentries, drawing water and distributing it to the Italian prisoners of war passing by. On the night of the 16th of this month, thousands of Italian prisoners of war were escorted to Buq Buq, gathering around the water troughs. A British infantry major was responsible for distributing food and drink to the Italian forces. As the reporters were talking with the major, an Italian officer stepped forward to pay his respects and requested a vehicle to transport several wounded soldiers to the infirmary. The major immediately granted his request and allowed the Italian doctor to drive himself. At the same time, British aircraft repeatedly bombarded Bardia, and the sound of exploding bombs and the roar of anti-aircraft guns reverberated through the air. The reporters climbed the coastal highlands east of Sollum and looked out at Bardia, seeing the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire and bomb explosions, which had never been seen before in North Africa.

<p>British Forces in East Africa Launch Offensive</p>
<p>Cairo – Last night, British forces launched a large-scale offensive in Italian East Africa, 2,000 miles from here.

<p>Nairobi – According to a public announcement here, South African troops and troops from the entire coast participated in the British offensive on the Italian Somaliland border at El Wak. This operation was a combined offensive by armored units and infantry, capturing at least 25 Italians, including several officers and 50 Italian colonial infantry. In addition, they also obtained artillery, machine guns, and large quantities of military supplies and ammunition. The Italian casualties were also 50. British casualties were minimal. The South African Air Force assisted in the operation and dropped two and a half tons of bombs. One enemy aircraft attacked, but was driven away by British fighters. Another enemy aircraft, seeing the shadow of British fighters, abandoned its remaining bombs and fled. One Italian Caproni aircraft has been shot down by British aircraft. El Wak is located 100 miles northeast of Wajir in Kenya and is one of the main border outposts in Italian Somaliland. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Greek Troops on Central Front Launch Bayonet Charge, Capturing Këlcyrë Yesterday; This City is an Important Gateway to Berat; Port of Durazzo Heavily Bombed by British Air Force</h3>
<p>Struga – Border news reports that at 9:30 this morning, Greek troops occupied Këlcyrë, a key defensive point and gateway to Berat, strongly defended by Italian troops. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Athens – A Greek Army communiqué stated that Greek troops continue to operate across the entire front and are quite successful. Italian troops are under heavy pressure and have suffered many losses, retreating to the entrenched Këlcyrë. Greek troops have seized large quantities of materials and captured some Italian soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel. Italian troops have now withdrawn from the key southern Albanian cities of Tepelenë and Gjirokastër, abandoning large quantities of materials accumulated over the past few months. Although Greek operations have been hampered by heavy snow, the fierce fighting after the fall of Pogradec was still profitable for the Greek troops. It is generally believed that the Greek positions along the entire front are quite satisfactory. In recent days, the weather has been very cold, and the Greek advance is expected to slow down gradually. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Athens – A Greek government spokesman said that even in the face of howling winds and falling snow, Greek troops are still bravely fighting in the Këlcyrë area. As the Greek Army is charging across the front lines in Albania, aircraft of the British Royal Air Force are also heavily bombing military locations on the Adriatic coast, again subjecting the important seaport of Durazzo to severe attack. The government spokesman continued that the most important battles have been taking place around Këlcyrë for the past two days. The enemy there is retreating from Mount Trebeshina. In recent days, the Italians' "remarkable resistance" has been due to the arrival of reinforcements ten miles east of Tepelenë. However, the Greek bayonet and melee fighting will eventually drive the Italian troops out of the highlands in Mount Trebeshina. Këlcyrë is the last important fortified position between the Greek location and Berat. Berat is twenty miles north of Këlcyrë and is the main connecting point for Italian supply and transport. It is reported that the British Air Force's bombing of the port of Durazzo has made it very difficult for Italian troops to land. It is rumored that Italian troops are heavily reinforcing this port in preparation for building a second line of defense once the fronts in the south from Vlorë to Elbasan and Lake Ohrid collapse. The spokesman continued that the Italian counter-offensive in the mountainous city and the coastal area behind Vlorë is an attempt to buy time to allow Italian artillery units in the mountains to build strong positions. However, Greek troops are pressing forward with the plan to crush the Fascists. Also, according to a British Air Force communiqué, the British Air Force, which has continuously bombed the Albanian seaport of Vlorë for several days, rendering it useless, further concentrated its attacks on Durazzo last night. British aviators who went to bomb Durazzo witnessed huge explosions and fires in the port's dockyards. British aircraft completed their missions and returned safely. Also, news from Struga on the north shore of Lake Ohrid in Yugoslavia says that Greek troops have advanced one-third of the way on the twenty-seven mile route from Tepelenë to Vlorë. It is also heard that the Greek troops have benefited greatly from the unrest in Albania and are now attacking the Italian rear, causing turmoil and disturbance in the Italian military's morale. Also, the Greek Ministry of the Army declared that the Greek artillery units have heavily bombed Këlcyrë, an important city located ten miles east of Tepelenë. On Mount Asim and further north, Greek troops have captured five Italian officers and 300 soldiers. Also, the Greek troops attacking along the coast have achieved the same success as the Greek troops near Tepelenë. After a short period of intense fighting, they have occupied Fterra, a few miles north of Himara. The Greek government spokesman also denied reports that Italian troops had reoccupied Palermë south of Himara, declaring that it is now in Greek hands. In the Pogradec area northeast of Tepelenë, although the mountain paths are very snowy and there are several deep snowdrifts, Greek troops are still advancing. Also, Radio Athens stated that even in adverse weather with rain and snow, our troops are making progress and have occupied several new positions and mountain villages of great strategic importance. These positions and villages were defended to the death by Italian troops. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<h3>Rumor of 50,000 German Troops Concentrated in Southern Italy; Nazi Spy Activities Deeply Infiltrated into Italy; Mussolini May Become the Second Quisling</h3>
<p>New York – According to a telegram received here from the capital of Yugoslavia, 50,000 German troops and large quantities of military supplies are now concentrated in Naples and Bari. It is claimed that this news comes from reliable sources. It is not yet known whether these German troops are intended for use in Libya or Albania. According to several reports received here, these German troops will perform security duties within Italy. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London – The Times recently published an article discussing the possibility of a Nazi occupation of Italy, saying that for the past two years, Italy has been riddled with various Nazi spies, as dense as beehives. After the outbreak of the war, the situation has become even more serious than before. The various methods commonly used by the Nazis before an invasion, which have been remarkably effective in Norway and the Netherlands, are also being implemented one by one in Italy. If the Italian side does not act quickly to deal with its internal threats, it will one day wake up and find that Italy has become an occupied area, and Mussolini is in the same position as Vidkun Quisling.

<h3>Berlin Denies German-Italian Friction</h3>
<p>Berlin – The Berlin Völkischer Beobachter published an article today strongly denying British reports that Germany and Italy had developed differences due to Italian military setbacks in Egypt. It declared that Germany would never abandon its friends halfway. Britain, towards its allies, often turns a blind eye when they encounter misfortune after completing their mission. It is judging others by its own standards, thinking that Germany's attitude towards Italy would be like Britain's towards its former allies, given the recent defeats of the Italian army in Egypt and Albania. However, Germany and Italy share common ideals and are fighting shoulder to shoulder in a war of liberation. Germany's unstoppable momentum has benefited from Italy's support. Although Italy's war is not going smoothly today, victory and defeat are commonplace in war. Temporary setbacks are not enough to shake the deeply rooted belief between the two nations. Germany and Italy are determined to form a united front to inflict a serious blow on the enemy and strive for final victory. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Italian Government Strictly Controls Food Supply; Hoarders Will Be Executed</h3>

<h3>Sweden Expresses Fear of the "New Order"; Military Control of the World Cannot Guarantee Lasting Peace</h3>
<p>Stockholm – The Swedish Foreign Minister said in a speech in Mynt yesterday that the new order and the distribution of living space included in the public announcements of the Axis powers and Japan cannot naturally attract the attention of Sweden and other small countries. If this were the case, all small countries would be placed within the designated space and lose their independence, and even the industries of the small countries would be subject to control and supervision to meet the needs of the great powers. It must be understood that dividing the world and making the small countries appendages of the living space of several great powers is difficult to guarantee lasting peace. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>The Three Small Countries of Europe: Their Fate and Future</h3>
<p>The Government of San Marino Denies Command of Its Thousand-Man Army by Italy</p>
<p>The capital of Switzerland: It was rumored that the Republic of San Marino had placed its one thousand soldiers under the command of the Italian Army General Staff and was planning to declare war on Britain. However, the government of San Marino has issued a public statement denying this. As the territories of various European countries undergo drastic changes, the three small countries of Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino have been fortunate enough to avoid invasion. The future fate of these countries is attracting worldwide attention. San Marino, located on the Adriatic coast, has an area of only 40 square miles and a population of only 14,000. Its national army consists of only 70 constables. However, the country claims that after a full national mobilization, it can field an army of one thousand soldiers. Although San Marino is an independent country, it has traditionally been under the "friendly protection" of the King of Italy. In 1887, it signed a treaty with Italy stipulating that San Marino could not be placed under the protection of another country. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3>The Largest Spectacle in History: The Closing of the New York World's Fair (Continued)</h3>
<p>The artworks in the Czechoslovakian Pavilion, except for those that have been sold, will mostly be loaned to various museums for display. The rare tropical birds in the Spanish Pavilion will be moved to Central Park. The American national products in the Federal Building will be distributed to various departments of the government in Washington. Among the items in the foreign exhibition areas that will remain in Flushing Meadows Park are the flagpole in front of the Swedish Pavilion, the fountain in front of the Turkish Pavilion, and the floral columns of the Canadian Pavilion.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of experts in industry and commerce, the various industrial products displayed at this New York World's Fair have been very effective in promoting industry and commerce, imparting knowledge, and arousing interest. After the closing, the exhibits of various manufacturers will either be transported to other locations for exhibition or moved to the branches of their companies, depending on their environment and needs. Therefore, people who did not visit the fair will have the opportunity to see the industrial exhibits again.</p>
<p>The artworks in the art section, considering only the masterpieces of great painters from various countries, are worth 30 million US dollars. On the day after the closing, the authorities dispatched armed police and used more than a dozen large trucks to move these precious treasures to warehouses in New York City, awaiting their retrieval by the more than two hundred exhibitors and the more than one hundred museum authorities. The "Art Association Company," which does not operate for profit, will dissolve immediately after all the exhibits are returned to their owners. The artistic works of modern writers will also be returned to their original exhibitors.</p>
<p>The exhibits in the jewelry section, worth 6 million US dollars, were moved out of the venue under armed protection on the day of the closing. The jewelry pavilion will not be demolished and will remain in Flushing Meadows Park as an embellishment. There were a total of six jewelry exhibitors. After the closing, their items were returned to their original owners, ensuring that each jewel was returned to its rightful place.</p>
<p>Many items at the fair were of great value, which will not be listed exhaustively. Even considering the various buildings alone, there was a wide variety of styles and unique designs, including futuristic, nationalistic, and regional styles. Visitors were delighted by all the expressions of "The World of Tomorrow" and enjoyed them to the fullest. Moreover, for the sake of appreciation, commemoration, and research, tourists all took photographs on the spot to aid their future reveries. According to the estimate of Mr. Mass, who is in charge of the photography section at the fair, 62% of the tourists brought cameras and captured the scenes they liked into their "cameras" at any time.</p>
<p>From 2:00 AM on October 28th, this once extremely grand World's Fair began its demolition process. Except for those items that will be left as embellishments in Flushing Meadows Park, all buildings, "obelisks," "spheres," gardens, and Washington statues, totaling 60 million US dollars in construction value, will be demolished. To facilitate the progress of the demolition work, the entire area has been divided into eight sections, with work proceeding in each section. The buildings to be demolished include 50 industrial buildings, 22 foreign pavilions, 4 US government buildings, and 125 buildings in the entertainment area. In total, there are 385 buildings to be demolished, which may take four to six months to complete. The section from the central courthouse, the central path, the tree-lined avenue, to Peace Square will be preserved in Flushing Meadows Park. Many of the complex fountains in the "International Lagoon" will be sold after being dismantled.</p>
<p>The original plan for Flushing Meadows Park included 72 tennis courts, 24 baseball fields, 11 playgrounds, 31 miles of trails, 5.8 miles of bicycle paths, and 4.7 miles of bridle paths. The lake will have a fleet of small boats that can accommodate 600 people. In addition, there will be indoor sports fields, ice rinks, and swimming pools. A portion of this large park is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and the entire project is scheduled for completion by the end of 1942.</p>
<p>This year's "Great White Way" and the entertainment area at the fair had a surplus in addition to covering expenses. Although the area was smaller than in 1939, the configuration of various lights and decorations was strengthened more than sevenfold, so the attraction to the audience was greatly enhanced compared to two years ago. After the closing, the various amusement rides in the entertainment area will be sold. Amusement park owners across the country are eager to acquire them, and it is said that their value is still half of the original price. The most popular performance in the entertainment area was the aerial parachuting, which was watched by 20,000 people during the two fair periods.</p>
<p>The most appealing attraction in the entertainment area was the water show, which was watched by a total of 8 million paying visitors over the two years, with 3 million this year. Other attractions, such as the Paris street scene performance, dance camps, and music halls, attracted more than 4.86 million visitors. The National Day commemorative parade attracted 2 million visitors. These are all high attendance records for the fair.</p>
<p>Very few crimes occurred during the fair. The police authorities handled only 254 arrest cases, mostly for minor offenses such as disorderly conduct. Apart from the bomb explosion in the Polish Pavilion on July 4, which killed and injured eight people, there were no other significant crime records. Thefts were also very rare. During the 1939 fair, 1,860 bottles of wine and brandy were stolen from the Romanian Pavilion. The culprit was arrested three days later, and all the stolen goods were returned to their owner. The fair police will continue to serve for two weeks after the closing.</p>
<p>The number of accidents at this year's fair was 50% lower than in 1939. According to a report by Dr. Hogland, the medical director of the fair, a total of 30,000 people sought treatment at the fair this year, suffering from various ailments. The most common ailments were eye problems, headaches, fatigue, and foot soreness. In 1940, only 14 people died at the fair. Twelve people died from heart attacks, and two died from injuries sustained in the bomb explosion. The mortality rate in 1939 was also 14 people, but one person died in an accident.</p>
<p>The total number of people who traveled to the fair from various places was 90 million. Thirty million people traveled on the vehicles of American Express and Greyhound Bus Company. Among them, the business of the bus company was the best, accounting for more than 28.5 million people.</p>
<p>The parking lot opened by the World's Fair Corporation accommodated 1,800,911 cars during the two-year period, with 800,000 cars this year. The parking fee this year was 25 cents per car, which was 50 cents lower than in 1939.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Detective Division of the US Treasury Department, the amount of counterfeit money used at the fair during the 1940 fair period was 684.40 US dollars. Last year it was 1376.20 US dollars. 132 US dollars of the counterfeit money were fake banknotes, and 552 US dollars were counterfeit coins. (End)</p>

<h3>Britain's War Aims: To Liberate Europe and Restore Freedom; No Peace Talks Until This Aim Is Achieved; Great Strength of British Naval and Air Force Replenishment; Sufficient to Counter Germany's Spring Offensive</h3>
<p>London: Lord Noel Buxton asked the government in the House of Lords yesterday to comment on any proposals for peace that Germany might make after Italy's entry into the war. Lord Snell, on behalf of the government, replied that the British government could not accept any arrangement that would allow Germany to permanently dominate Europe. The British government is absolutely determined to do everything in its power to remove the shackles of all countries now under the iron heel of Germany and restore their former independence and prosperity. Lord Snell also recalled a statement made by the late Minister of Works, Mr. Burgin, on November 20 regarding Germany's repeated proposals that if Britain would allow Germany to act freely in Europe, Germany would be happy to maintain good relations with Britain. Snell said that the British government was not prepared to discuss this arrangement. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production, said in a broadcast last night that Hitler is preparing to invade Britain from the sea, land, and air before next spring, with a focus on air invasion. However, Britain is now stronger on all fronts than before and can supply all pilots on the front lines with various types of aircraft. What Britain needs most are Sturge bombers. Aircraft production has doubled in the past four months compared to last year. American aircraft of excellent design are being shipped in steadily and are increasing in number. The quality of some American fighters is comparable to the best British fighters. Hitler relies on a three-legged stool to collude with other countries and rule Europe: (1) air superiority, (2) mechanized troops, and (3) the methods of the Fifth Column and the panic it creates. German newspapers are daily revealing signs that Hitler plans to launch a large air force offensive in the spring. We will counter and overcome this danger with industrial enterprise and courageous spirit. This will be a difficult struggle, but aircraft manufacturers have already taken on difficult tasks and will complete them satisfactorily. The cost of the aircraft lost by Britain in the past four months of air combat has been covered by public donations. The development of the war has now become a contest between the industrial strength of Britain and the combined resources of the warring and conquered countries of Europe. We will quickly destroy the enemy with labor. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Officials here declare that defending against the German submarine threat is not as much a matter of any new technical problem as it was during the last war. The only difficulty was the lack of escort ships, but this has now been completely resolved by the increase in naval warships and the granting of American destroyers. Although not many American destroyers have entered service, it is believed that the equipment on board has been improved to undertake escort duties. It is also reported that the British government has now decided to increase the number of aircraft protecting sea routes. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Basel Bombing Incident: Switzerland Protests to Britain, Demanding Compensation for All Losses and Guaranteeing That Similar Incidents Will Not Happen Again</h3>
<p>The capital of Switzerland: The Federal Council's Department of the Interior recently issued a statement saying, "Several foreign aircraft invaded the airspace above our city of Basel last night. After investigation, it was confirmed that they belonged to Britain. The bombs dropped on and around the two Basel train stations were also confirmed to be of British manufacture. At the time, a 500-pound bomb pierced the roof of a residential building and landed in the cellar without exploding, making it very easy to identify. The government has instructed its embassy in Britain to lodge a strong protest with the British government, because last night the moon was bright and the snow was clear, making it very easy for pilots to recognize their location, and there should not have been this mistake. In addition to demanding compensation for losses, we also ask the British government to take all measures to guarantee that the same unfortunate event will not happen again." In addition, the Basel state authorities have decided to request the Federal Council to cancel the lighting control measures implemented in the border area of the country, so that foreign aircraft can easily recognize the border between Switzerland and the warring countries. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Bern: The Swiss semi-official news agency reported that the planes that bombed Basel, Switzerland on Monday night were British planes. According to the latest news, 16 bombs were dropped in the area, mostly around the train station at 11:05 PM. Yesterday's Swiss bulletin said that four people were killed and several injured in the bombing, and significant material damage was also sustained. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Cooperation: The Two Sides Conclude an Agreement to Prevent Clothing Competition</h3>
<p>Rome: A joint German-Italian clothing and fashion industry committee has been established with a cooperation agreement. Its purpose is to prevent unnecessary competition and to exchange colors and styles. The German fashion industry will use Italian artistic creations, and Italy will use German technical improvements and new styles. A permanent fashion committee has now been established to handle fashion exhibitions in both countries, and the export of their products will also be carried out cooperatively. The Dutch "International Textile" fashion magazine has been acquired by the German side for external propaganda purposes. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Duke of Windsor Says He Did Not Ask to Be Ambassador to the US, But He Would Not Refuse the Position</h3>
<p>Miami: The Duke of Windsor told reporters that he did not ask to be appointed as ambassador to the United States to succeed Lord Lothian, but if he believes this matter is in the best interests of both Britain and the United States, then he will definitely accept it. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor set sail for Nassau at 10 PM last night on the Southern Cross yacht. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London: British authoritative sources say that no decision has yet been made regarding the selection of Lord Lothian's successor. Yesterday, there were doubts in the House of Commons about the truth of Lord Lothian's death. Sir Jones asked Foreign Secretary Halifax to provide a detailed report on Lothian's death. Jones said, "I am very eager to hear that Lothian had a good death." (International News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: It is declared here that Lord Lothian's ashes will be temporarily stored in the United States until the end of the European war. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Finland Holds Presidential Election</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Finland is scheduled to hold a presidential election tomorrow. The election delegates arrived here yesterday, and the election committees met yesterday and discussed until late at night without adjourning. The various political parties in the parliament also met last night, but so far, no candidate for president has been decided. All parties seem to agree to elect a non-partisan leader as president.

<p>The fourth Shen Bao Cup Sino-American charity basketball game: The Sino-American teams will have their second decisive battle tonight starting early at 7:30 PM, still at the YMCA basketball hall. The Chinese team unfortunately suffered a narrow defeat of eight points in the first game the night before. In the second game tonight, they are determined to break the pot and sink the boat, fighting to the death to defeat the American team, so as to have a final decisive battle in the third game. Therefore, the intensity of the battle and the excitement of the performance between the two teams tonight are self-evident. The Chinese team is also deeply aware of the importance of tonight's battle, because one defeat will determine the overall situation. They must not be defeated, so they will definitely win. After the first game, the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese team's lineup have been revealed, so they will take the best of both sides to make up for their weaknesses and fight with the best lineup. Considering that the Chinese team reversed the score by five points in the second half of the game the night before, there is great hope for victory tonight. The referees are Bratt and Zheng Zhifang.

Most of the 200 five-yuan tickets have been sold, and the remaining tickets are still on sale at the Shen Bao newspaper office on Hankou Road and the YMCA on Jingan Temple Road. There are not many left, so get them soon. The 410 three-yuan tickets for the upstairs seats are still available, and many have already been purchased.</p>
<h3>YMCA Basketball Yesterday: Hua Xing Defeats Giant in First Game; Shanghai Star Loses to Bears After Hard Fight</h3>
<p>The YMCA basketball game was held last night for the second act of this season. The prelude was Shanghai Star vs. Little Bears. The Bears have been dominating the YMCA for years, and recently they have been strengthened by the addition of a new player Yenick, who weighs nearly 250 pounds, making their strength even stronger. Shanghai Star has recently attracted famous players such as Xu Jusheng and Fan Qingxian, and their strength still exists. However, because they have not gathered for a long time, their cooperation lacks understanding. The score was 14 to 27 in the first half. After the break, Shanghai Star demonstrated their full strength and shone brightly. Zhang Jinxuan scored consecutively, and Liang Yunming and Zheng Qinming also contributed, adding as many as 11 points in one breath, chasing from 14 to 27 to 23 to 27, with a difference of only two points. Fan Qingxian scored a shot and two free throws, and instantly chased to 29 to 29. The future was bright, and the hope was great. At this point, the tension reached its peak. Unexpectedly, at this final moment, Dubringki scored two consecutive goals, and Yenick added a free throw, putting the Bears ahead again with 34 to 29. Zhang Jinxuan once again chased to 31 to 34, but unfortunately, after Dubringki added three points, the buzzer sounded, and Shanghai Star was defeated with 31 to 37. The finale was the new strong team Hua Xing in this session. In their first appearance, they faced the Giant. Hua Xing has many talented players, while the Giant's skills were not high, making the two teams seem worlds apart. After Li Zhenzhong opened the scoring, Bao Songyuan added four points. After 6 to 12, Hua Xing was like a rushing river. In the first half, Hua Xing took an absolute advantage with 22 to 8. After the break, Hua Xing was strong and imposing, with the momentum of splitting bamboo. The Giant could only parry and had no chance to fight back. Until the end of the game, they only scored eight points, while Hua Xing added another 19 points. Because Hua Xing was confident of winning, they did not overdo it and did not use their full strength. In summary, they won their first victory of the season with 41 to 16.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Turns Tight Amidst Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American currencies first loosened and then tightened, making the trends difficult to grasp. Speculators were not coordinated, and the sentiment was somewhat volatile, while those with nervous temperaments still clung to bullish dreams, buying on dips. In the early morning today, the U.S. dollar was traded as high as 5.875 yuan, but the noon closing price softened to 5.8125 yuan. British gold also retreated to 3/8s 67 1/8 75. The afternoon market on Wednesday was closed, with the overnight rate tightening by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively.</p>
<p>Speculators Enter the Futures Market for U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large orders for both near and distant futures fell by 0.0625. The silver price in New York was flat, and London's spot gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar was unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also flat. The U.S. dollar's rate against the British pound was unchanged, but the rate against Shanghai was one point higher. The central bank's posted rates for various currencies, such as the Bank of China's opening rates in the morning, were real spot prices: British gold at 3/8s 68.75 and the U.S. dollar at 5.84375 yuan. These rates were no different from the closing prices of the previous evening. After opening, Chinese merchants and speculators came to sell, and the market immediately fluctuated. The Jardine Matheson bank absorbed U.S. dollars for delivery this month at a rate of 5.875 yuan. HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged. The white silver balance tax was 0.50% lower. After this, the market quieted down. After 10:00 a.m., the Japanese bank Mitsui began to settle U.S. dollars for January delivery with foreign banks at a rate of 5.84375 yuan. Subsequently, speculators also became eager to buy, purchasing a considerable amount of U.S. dollar futures from foreign and Chinese banks, leading to a gradual softening of the underlying trend. It is estimated that the opening price for U.S. dollars for January delivery ranged from 5.84375 to 8125 yuan, but by the time of closing, it was difficult to settle at 8125 yuan. The closing prices were: near-term British gold at 3/8s 67 1/8 75, U.S. dollar at 5.8125 yuan; distant-term British gold at 3/8s 65 5/8 25, U.S. dollar at 5.78125 yuan. Compared with the evening closing prices of the previous day, British gold futures and spot prices tightened by 0.015625, and the U.S. dollar shrank by 0.03125. The afternoon market on Wednesday was closed.</p>

<h3>Northern Faction Pours In, Gold Market Soars; There Were Buyers at 6,000 Yuan in the Over-the-Counter Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the gold market, the spot market fluctuated wildly, falling before suddenly rebounding and soaring, causing the 5,900 yuan threshold to be breached again, before retreating. Rumors spread of a shift in favor of buyers, and it was heard that the northern faction had poured in over 3,000 taels. The foreign exchange market also tightened, and the general sentiment was bullish. Since the market opened in the morning, carrying on the downward momentum from the previous day, it immediately retreated to 5,905 yuan. Securities firms then reported a retreat to 5,890 yuan. As the foreign exchange market stopped loosening and began to tighten, bullish rumors suddenly arose, claiming that "the new central bank and the issuance of banknotes are back in favor," and that "securities firms are vying for gold and the northern faction is increasing its purchases." This led to a dramatic surge, soaring to 5,965 yuan, before settling at 5,960 yuan, a rise of 38 yuan, with a fluctuation of 65 yuan. The total transaction volume for the first half of the day was around 6,000 taels. The afternoon market on Wednesday was closed. The over-the-counter price had risen to 6,000 yuan with buyers. Small money changers were mutually doing 500 taels of swap transactions, with buyers paying sellers 36 yuan. The spot price from gold firms to money changers for 50 taels was 36 yuan lower than the forward price. Silver shops were mutually doing 50 taels, 35 yuan lower. Ornamental gold rose by 5 yuan, to 610 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Market Surged by 38 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning opening at 9:00 a.m., each bar (ten taels) was down 17 yuan. Two silver shops mutually did 20 taels at a price of 5,905 yuan. Xinhao and other firms entered silver shops for dozens of taels, rising to 5,915 yuan. As foreign exchange was reported as hardening, securities firms came to sell aggressively, causing retail investors to push the price down by 25 yuan, to within 5,900 yuan. Securities firms sold dozens of taels to gold firms, dropping to 5,890 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold firms aggressively continued to buy, and as they learned that foreign exchange had turned soft due to the Japanese bank's purchases, a certain securities firm came to buy, supposedly on behalf of the northern faction. Small money changers also scrambled to buy, and the price rebounded to 5,900 yuan, then rose by 75 yuan. A certain money changer entered a silver shop for 100 taels, raising the price to 5,965 yuan. Then, a silver shop sold 30 taels to a gold firm. The noon closing price was 5,960 yuan, a rebound of 38 yuan compared to the previous day. After the closing, the price rose to 5,968 yuan, before settling at 5,960 yuan. The afternoon market on Wednesday was closed. The storefront selling price of the current brand of gold firms was several yuan lower than the spot price, and the buying price was 50 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market or price for current margin gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Rose by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silverware and jewelry per tael, quoted by Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang in the morning, was 605 yuan, rising by 5 yuan at noon to 610 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Demand for Japanese Currency Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price in the foreign currency market fluctuated wildly, rising sharply after falling. British and American gold pounds also first fell and then rose, eventually rising by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price stabilized. American gold notes initially retreated to 17.01 yuan, but then steadily rose, eventually reaching 17.225 yuan, an increase of 0.20 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes was also strong, and the market price rose sharply. Demand for Japanese gold notes sharply decreased, and the evening price retreated to 1.575 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes was balanced, and the market price stabilized, remaining at 1.33 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Stirs Quietly, Footing Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained in a state of suppression. However, due to the strict market surveillance, these people were unable to engage in private black market transactions. Those holding goods were still unwilling to sell at high prices. Only general mid-range goods saw some trading. However, those thinking about the market were pessimistic and became less enthusiastic. At the same time, actual sales were cautious, fearing that the market would fall if it did not rise. As a result, prices for all kinds of foreign rice showed no gains or losses, and the trend seemed to be declining.</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was still scarce, so the sentiment in the early market was quite firm, and shouts continued to raise prices. However, later, due to the sluggishness of the foreign rice market, prices softened again. As a result, the selling prices can be said to be a fixed position compared to the previous market. Kunshan ho sold white japonica rice for 100 yuan, 99 yuan, and a special 102 yuan. Qingjiao saw thin rice at 91 yuan to 89 yuan.</p>
<p>Although glutinous rice was not subject to restrictions, its use was not widespread, causing both actual stomach and hoarders in the sales field to become inferior. However, there was no intention to loosen the goods, so the selling price was barely held and did not change. If Yili white yuan was 85 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan was a special 85 yuan, a regular 83 yuan, and glutinous tea was 73.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Swire Company's Suiyang vessel, loaded with 1,259 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Pudong Wharf. It is scheduled to be transferred to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession today for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Flour Also Trades in the Black Market; A Huge Amount of Foreign Flour Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market was unusually firm. After the Wild Boar and Flower Goddess brands of Australian flour opened at a high price of 22 yuan the day before, speculative hoarders were still excited. However, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, seeing that flour also had speculative manipulation, deeply feared accidents and strictly prohibited buying and selling in the market. As the rice price stabilized slightly, the Flower Bird Clock Tower brand was still heard to be 21.5 yuan, and the Golden brand was 21.34 yuan, and the Triangle brand was 21 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags traded, all in the over-the-counter market. The Chinese flour factory's price has not changed, but each factory is unable to supply normally due to a shortage of raw materials. It is heard that this matter is still under discussion. It is also heard that a huge amount of foreign flour, a total of about 400,000 bags, will arrive in port around the 20th, at which time the flour price can be lowered.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market was still suppressed. It was found that both domestic and foreign sources were scarce. Japanese and Chinese factories were eager to obtain raw materials, but ultimately regretted that there were no goods to receive. It was heard that yesterday, the Chinese factory received more than 200 bags of Zhongjue wheat, priced at 31 yuan. The selling price of Gao wheat still needs to be increased. The Japanese factory's retail receiving price has not yet been actually released, so there were no goods to receive. The market was as silent as before.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>In the over-the-counter market, public bonds continued to rise yesterday. Class C even broke through 4 yuan, and Class E also broke through 3 yuan. People's hearts were agitated, and retail investors greatly covered their short positions. There was no significant change in the news. However, Xinfu suddenly turned from short to long, and the market turned from weak to strong. It is feared that this will not last. Yesterday morning, Xinfu entered the market again and bought, turning from short to long, and the bulls closed their positions, taking the opportunity to raise prices. The market price was already high in the forenoon. In the afternoon, Xinfu absorbed again, with a total of 800,000 yuan before and after. The 25th bought 300,000 yuan, and Yongchang's entered more than 100,000 yuan. Most of them were closing by bulls, and Yilirun and Lizhenchang sold slightly. As a result, it continued to rise by 0.3-0.4 yuan, with a turnover of 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the public industry stock market was quiet, but suddenly turned firm. The public's buying interest in steel stocks was particularly strong. The opening price of the stock was only 32.75 yuan, and it gradually rose to a high price of 36.5 yuan at closing, with a transaction volume of 56,000 shares. Other industrial stocks also made considerable progress. Rubber stocks were also carried up.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East Central Commercial Company stocks. The Far East stocks were slightly active. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to a price of 8 pounds and 5 shillings. Glugor Rubber shares rose by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to a price of 15 shillings and 7 1/2 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Ayer Tawah Rubber Pays Dividends</p>
<p>Ayer Tawah Rubber Limited, managed by Wah Chang Yangxing, will pay a final dividend of 1.2 yuan per share in national currency for the year ending September 1940, including the interim dividend of 0.2 yuan per share already paid, for a total of 1.4 yuan per share. The thirty-first annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held on December 27.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Double Horse Yarn Reached a New High Price Again in the Afternoon: 1,348 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had turned down the previous day, rebounded yesterday. This unpredictable market makes it difficult to grasp. In fact, this is due to the active buying and selling and the high volume of transactions. Thinking about the cotton yarn itself, it should be stable. Unfortunately, the speculative interest in Double Horse yarn is strong, which causes the ups and downs. The current 32-count yarn is quite popular, while 20-count yarn is still being bought. However, some people say that the price of 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn is cheaper than that of Bianma. Today, 270 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening of Double Horse was flat due to the decline in popularity the previous day. The initial price was 1,322 yuan. After opening, it slightly fell to 1,318 yuan. At this time, there were quite a few people who were short and bearish. There were three round trips between 1,318 yuan and 1,323 yuan. Then it was heard that foreign exchange had shrunk and gold had risen. The telegrams from general small silver firms were mostly buying orders. A large silver firm was exclusively dragging five or six hundred bales. The temporary table was tight, and general followers chased and entered the market, so the market situation quickly rebounded, and the market became higher and higher. It can be said that it was an inverse proportion to yesterday, rising directly to 1,339 yuan at closing. The total transaction statistics for the day were 5,120 bales. The行情 of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan. The amount of each helping purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Same trade 4,800 Hong Kong 320</p>
<p>Total 5,120</p>
<p>The market continued to rise in the afternoon. 20-count Double Horse began to trade at 1,341 yuan, and then traded at 1,347-1,348 yuan, with a turnover of 100-200 bales. A new peak was discovered.</p>
<h3>5,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive; Tianjin Faction Procures Long-Staple Cotton</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains quiet and not as high as the yarn market. This is because the cotton market has no speculation, and the pricing of foreign cotton is more cost-effective, so the excitement is weak. Moreover, factories have no wholesale purchases.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. The British Company's Santhia vessel arrived from Karachi the day before, with a total of 5,175 bales of cotton, and docked at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>Another news item: In the foreign cotton market, the Red Agreement cotton market was slightly active. Later, due to the purchase of colleagues and a part of the short covering, the closing price was one or two pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian market was closed yesterday.</p>
<p>In Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions, Tianjin is quite interested in buying long-staple raw cotton, so customers have started purchasing in Shanghai. However, the factory in this port has a very light purchase intention. The inventory in the market is low, and the exchange rate is tightening, so the future of the cotton market can be bright.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply in the Afternoon, Especially Fine Cloth</h3>
<p>The morning market for factory cloth was flat, but in the afternoon, it was consistently strong. This was due to the tightening of foreign exchange, and colleagues and hoarders were eager to search for cheap goods, and floating households changed their attitude and also moved in, so the selling disk rebounded. Coarse, fine, and twill cloth rose by about 0.25 yuan per foot, bleached and dyed cloth rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan per piece. The factory raised prices because the raw yarn was soaring, and the price after the market also shouted high by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Many orders were placed in the morning according to the original disk of the previous day.</p>
<p>1,400-1,500 pieces of various fabrics were traded in this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs purchased more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, poplin, etc. Zhejiang and Fujian gangs purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, etc. The Beilu Yantai gang purchased more than 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth spot and futures. Overseas Singapore and other places handled 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and printed cloth. Today, 865 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dongbu was tightened by the industry's small purchases from inside and outside. When the market opened in the morning, Longtou fine cloth was 37.3-37.4 yuan, with few sellers and many buyers, and gradually pulled up to 37.75 yuan. At closing, Si Jun thousand billige rose to 1.14 yuan. The mid-range fine cloth brands were firm, rising sharply by 0.5-0.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cloth: Speculation in Edible Oil is Rampant—Prices Soaring by 5-6 Yuan—</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the oil market, due to the result of general speculative national households failing to deliver the goods for futures settlement (there are still some undecided February), the market absorbed spot oil the next day, so at the beginning of the morning opening, the market was full of buying, and the momentum was more rampant than the previous day. The reason is that in the situation of supply and demand imbalance, the market price is soaring in a straight line. As a result, the volume of transactions is not large, but the market price has soared by 5-6 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of 700 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 600 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil, 80 pieces of Yanyi soybean oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, more than 100 pieces of new goods, 20 pieces of road goods, 60 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 1,000 cans of canned oil, 150 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, and 50 barrels of new goods were traded. The price details are in the market price column.</p>
<p>Exports on the 19th include 1,150 bags of soybeans, 2,550 pieces of soybean cakes, 250 bags of raw peanuts, 320 cans of raw oil, 350 bags of sesame seeds, and 250 cans of sesame oil, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Retract</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's tightening trend over the past few days has eased, and prices have softened slightly. The association's disk, the spot foreign warehouse 24 coarse white, initially called 75.5 yuan, and later traded at 75.1 yuan, down 0.9 yuan. The January 15th warehouse list was 75.5 yuan, and the Holland cotton white BS mark was 73.8 yuan, up 0.4 yuan. Holland red has risen nearly 4 yuan after the fact, and also eased yesterday. The spot price was 59.2-59.3 yuan to 0.5 yuan, small 0.5 yuan. The end of this month's list was 59.5 yuan, small 0.7 yuan. The Taikoo car white B mark was called 75 yuan, the end of this month's list was 74 yuan, small 1 yuan. The DJ mark was 71.5 yuan, small 0.1 yuan, and the HY mark was 71.3 yuan. The Dong warehouse was 70.07 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Rises by More Than 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local silk market was relatively active, and Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms purchased goods, with a total of 60 bales traded. 78% 20.22 條 of white factory silk was sold at 4,725 yuan, which was 75 yuan higher than the previous week's price. The user side did not have a transaction because silk was scarce.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Indian bituminous coal has recently been in short supply, and the number disk is waiting for a high price. The colleague's dismantling price has been opened to 225 yuan, but they are still unwilling to sell, so yesterday the bank disk has called 230 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than the previous week's price. The store's sales in this street are 30 yuan per basket, and screened blocks are 240 yuan per ton. It is heard that the dismantling price will continue to increase in the near future due to the continuous rise.</p>
<h3>Financial Statements (Continued from the 16th): Saint Keynes—December 14th—</h3>
<p>However, this amendment is by no means beneficial to Japan's wartime finance. It is precisely the phenomenon of Japan's wartime finance and finance collapsing and the currency expanding on a small scale. According to the facts in France, in order to facilitate loans to the government, the maximum limit on the amount of issuance increased with the amount of government loans, so that at first the maximum limit on the amount of issuance was expanded every year, and later it was expanded several times a year. For example, in August 1914, it was expanded to 12 billion francs, in May 1915 to 15 billion, in March 1916 to 18 billion, in February 1917 to 21 billion, and in September to 24 billion, in March 1918 to 27 billion, in May to 30 billion, and in July to 33 billion francs. Now Japan wants to stipulate the maximum annual amount of issuance, will it not be the same as France in 1914-1918, increasing the maximum limit on the amount of issuance in a straight line!</p>
<p>According to observations by Japanese financial figures: the amount of issuance by the Bank of Japan at the end of this year will reach 4 billion. In the face of the fact that the vicious expansion of banknotes in front of our eyes is unstoppable, no high-level financial expert can change it, unless they give up their ambition for aggression!</p>
<h3>China's Direct Taxes</h3>
<p>This week, Reuters not only conveyed hints of Japan's financial and monetary straits, but also reported on the direct tax revenue situation in China, a mainstay of the anti-aggression war's finances. It is said that the Chinese government hopes that direct tax revenues from income tax, profit tax, stamp tax, inheritance tax, etc., can reach a total of 135 million yuan next year, and land tax can reach at least 200 million yuan. It is also said that from the beginning of this year to November 28th, income tax revenue was 43.9 million yuan, profit tax was 37 million yuan, stamp tax was 4.7 million yuan, and inheritance tax, although only levied from July 1st, has already collected 2,700 yuan. In recent years, due to military reasons, not much has been published regarding the financial situation, so those who want to study China's wartime finances have been struggling to find suitable information. The author will introduce some of the recent developments in direct taxes in the following commentary.</p>
<p>China's direct taxes are divided into the four taxes mentioned above: income, profit, stamp, and inheritance. Income tax was first levied before the war, starting with the second category of civil servant salary income and the third category of government bond interest income on October 1, 1936. On January 1, 1937, the first category of business profit tax was also levied. The excessive profit tax during the emergency period has been levied since January 1, 1939.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the income tax, the results have been very satisfactory. The budgeted amount for the 1936 fiscal year was 5 million yuan, but the actual revenue exceeded 6.4 million yuan. The budgeted amount for the 1937 fiscal year was 25 million yuan. Due to the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, China's industry and commerce in the treaty ports suffered great damage, affecting tax revenue. However, the actual revenue was still more than 20 million yuan, accounting for more than 80% of the budgeted amount. In 1938, because China's fiscal year was changed to the calendar year, there were only six months, and the budgeted amount was half of the previous year, totaling 12.5 million yuan. The actual revenue was 8.6 million yuan, accounting for 70% of the budgeted amount. The budgeted amount for 1939 was 30 million yuan, and the actual revenue exceeded 32 million yuan. The budgeted amount for 1940 was 35 million yuan, and according to Reuters, it has already exceeded by 9 million yuan. Currently, among the various national tax revenues, the development of income tax has risen from the sixth position in the 1936 fiscal year to the third position this year, based on the budgeted amount, and is seven times that of 1936.</p>
<p>Among the direct taxes, income tax ranks first, followed by profit tax. The budgeted amount for 1940 was 24 million yuan, but due to the soaring prices during the war, all industries and businesses made money, resulting in strong tax revenue. According to Reuters, it has already exceeded by 13 million yuan.</p>
<p>Next is the stamp tax. The budget for 1940 was more than 10 million yuan, and the inheritance tax was 2 million yuan. Compared with the budgeted amount, the difference is still large. Inheritance tax was only established in July this year, so it is naturally difficult to expect immediate results. As for the reduction in stamp tax, the main reason is still tax evasion. For example, large companies and stores in Shanghai often use the excuse that the stamps are temporarily sold out and add a "no stamps available" stamp on the invoices to evade taxes. It is hoped that all companies and stores can understand that reducing the state's tax revenue by one point will weaken the financial strength of the war of resistance by one point, and increase the pain of being exploited themselves, and make improvements.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Policing Agreement: Municipal Council Actually Agrees; Formal Signing Almost a Reality; Rumor Has It That Tax Revenue Issues Have Also Been Resolved</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources on the foreign side, the Municipal Council has approved the policing agreement established between Major Bogue, Chief Inspector of the Police Force, and Lu Ying. Therefore, the formal signing of the agreement is almost a certainty. At the same time, it is rumored that both parties have also reached a resolution regarding tax revenue in the extra-settlement road area. According to the original regulations, for the area within 100 meters of the public concession border in the extra-settlement road area, the tax revenue would be collected by the Municipal Council. Outside of 100 meters, the tax revenue would be collected by the Chinese side. However, since the fall of the suburbs, this agreement has not been followed, leading to frequent conflicts between the Municipal Council and the "Gao Government" regarding tax revenue issues. Extremists within the "Municipal Government" are advocating for the seizure of the Municipal Council's tax revenue in the extra-settlement road area, but well-informed sources believe that this will not become a reality.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning's Lowest Temperature: Below Freezing Point; Weather Forecast Predicts Warming Trend</h3>
<p>According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory, the lowest temperature at dawn yesterday had fallen to 3.1 degrees Celsius below freezing point, or 26.4 degrees Fahrenheit, marking the first day of extreme cold this year. Ice has begun to appear in the ditches. The north wind is strong and biting, and the cold is extraordinary. Pedestrians on the street all appear to be shrinking from the cold. Furthermore, it is reported that Qingdao experienced snowfall the day before yesterday. Although it was sunny yesterday, the extreme cold was even more severe than in Shanghai. This cold front was caused by a sudden westward advance of a high-pressure system from Siberia towards Shanghai. Now that the cold front has only reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Shanghai area, it will soon head east out to sea. According to the observatory's predictions, this cold weather will warm up in the days after the high-pressure system passes Shanghai. Because the weather is clear and crisp, there will be no rain or snow. As for the hurricane that recently occurred in the Pacific Ocean, it is showing signs of dissipation and will not strike Shanghai. It is reported that the Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the French Concession has received reports from various police stations and shops, residents, and the morgue, stating that a total of twenty-six adult corpses and sixty-three juvenile corpses of those who froze to death have been collected over the past two days. The majority of the adult corpses are those who were addicted to opium.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Organization: Public Warehouse Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The establishment of public warehouses in Shanghai to store 200,000 bags of grain, in order to ensure the people's food supply, has been initiated. Currently, the rice industry has pledged 50,000 bags, the silver and money industry has pledged 50,000 bags, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing has pledged 50,000 bags. It is rumored that the remaining 50,000 bags have been pledged by the flour, yarn, flower, and metal industries. The "Rice Industry Public Warehouse Grain Storage Committee" has been established, and twenty-nine members have been appointed, including Chen Ziyi, Xing Zhigang, Zhu Zixiang, She Bingwen, Zhou Zhizhen, Zhang Lizhong, Fu Qian'geng, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, Chen Shide, Yan Jiyun, Liu Liugu, and He Quanzhuang. A first committee meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Douchi Industry Association hall on the third floor of 15 Edward Road. However, although the rice market is monitored by a supervisory group organized by the management committee to oversee trading among industry members, the market price limits were still broken yesterday. It is unknown what the management committee thinks about this.</p>
<h3>Beggar Reception Center: To Be Completed Within the Year; 25 Buildings with Comprehensive Facilities; Capacity for 2,000 People; Vocational Training and Education to Be Provided; Salvation Army Invited the Press to Visit Yesterday</h3>
<p>With the soaring prices in the city, the number of impoverished people becoming beggars is increasing daily. With the arrival of this harsh winter, their lives are endangered by exposure to the cold and starvation. This is a serious problem for society. The Salvation Army in the city, recognizing this, has specially established a beggar reception center as a solution. In addition to cooperating, the Municipal Council has generously lent land. Construction began on the first day of this month and is now mostly completed. The leaders of the Salvation Army specially invited the press in the city to visit the site at Singapore Road and Hardoon Road at 10:30 AM yesterday. The Director of the Health Department of the Municipal Council and other dignitaries also visited in person, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Most of the Project Completed</p>
<p>The site of the reception center is very spacious, covering approximately 15 and a half mu. When reporters arrived, the area was filled with the sounds of construction, as 100 workers were working hard to build it. Currently, 18 dormitories have been built, arranged in six rows, which is very neat. The walls are made of woven bamboo strips, and the roofs are made of reed mats and fir wood, coated with asphalt to protect against rain and snow. Each building is 18 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 50 feet long, with a row of double and single-layer bamboo beds inside, accommodating 75 people. There are still seven buildings to be built, requiring 20,000-30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Beggar Reception Center</p>
<p>The beggar reception center, organized by the Salvation Army, is located at the corner of Singapore Road and Hardoon Road, covering 15 and a half mu. Eighteen temporary buildings have already been completed and the total project is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The picture shows a portion of the reception center. (Photo by Zhang Hong) In the lower left corner is the Dutch Consul who visited yesterday (third from the left). (Photo by Zhou Xianghua)</p>
<p>All School Site Borrowed</p>
<p>Next to the reception center was originally a Municipal Council elementary school. Because the site was insufficient, the Municipal Council specially lent the entire elementary school site. The elementary school will relocate at the end of this month. The elementary school buildings are intended to be used as offices for the reception center and an attached hospital, and a portion will be used as rain showers and kitchens. Currently, construction is underway. A corner of the elementary school playground has also been designated for the construction of classrooms and an auditorium. The perimeter of the site has been enclosed with a tall bamboo fence to prevent beggars from escaping.</p>
<p>Medical Treatment, Disease Prevention, and Education to Be Provided</p>
<p>According to Salvation Army leader Ma Ruishan yesterday, the beggar reception center will be completed by the end of this month, and the Municipal Council will capture approximately 2,000 beggars and send them to the center. It will be officially established on New Year's Day next year. When beggars enter the center, each person will be given two quilts and a set of cotton clothes. They will also undergo physical examinations to treat their illnesses and addictions. A workshop is planned within the center, divided into towel, leather shoe, weaving, and sewing departments, to enable older beggars to learn productive skills. Those who are illiterate and child beggars will also attend classes every day to be taught and instilled with knowledge so that they can become useful people. The cost of food is approximately 5 jiao 5 fen per person per day for two meals. It is reported that the opening expenses and funds for the reception center come from the Municipal Council, but the ongoing maintenance costs will be covered by public donations. Forty percent of the entertainment tax revenue of the Public Concession has been allocated to the Salvation Army as funds for the beggar reception center.</p>

<p>Outcome of the Dyeing Industry Labor Strike</p>
<p>The city's dyeing industry workers, numbering over three thousand, went on strike last month after their demand for dye workers to be paid per unit of dyed cloth was not met. It was learned yesterday that the employers have now agreed to double the payment until the end of the year. Workers in the finishing department made the same request, which was also agreed upon by the employers. The issue of payment per unit of dyed cloth will be determined next year, so the workers have all resumed work. Yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m., the Dyeing Industry Association convened a meeting of its members to discuss the procedures for all silk shops to increase dyeing fees on a per-unit basis starting next year, as well as the issue of increased payment.</p>
<p>Garment Industry Work Stoppage Yesterday</p>
<p>The city's garment industry (i.e., clothing stores) employees, numbering over two thousand, jointly went on strike yesterday morning at 8 a.m. due to soaring prices and meager monthly salaries that made it impossible to maintain a livelihood. They elected representatives to present ten demands for improved treatment to the employers, requesting a response. As a result, clothing stores along Fujian Road were closed yesterday, with all employees remaining in their respective stores, awaiting a resolution to the labor dispute. There are approximately 300 clothing stores in the city, with the largest concentration, 64 stores, located on Fujian Road, followed by over 30 stores on Xinzha Road, over 10 stores on Route Robert, over 20 stores in Caojiadu, and several dozen stores each on Caishi Road, North Henan Road, and Xujiahui. The labor side made ten demands for the 2,000-plus employees: (1) Recognition of the Employees' Association. (2) Employees should not be dismissed without cause; in special circumstances, one month's severance pay should be provided. (3) The minimum salary should be increased to 16 yuan, with a monthly allowance of 2 yuan. (4) The commission should be increased from 2.5% to 4%. (5) The commission on each piece should range from one dime to two, four dimes, etc. (6) Solicitation should not exceed three hours. (7) Solicitation should cease during windy and rainy weather. (8) Abolish the system of liability for damaged goods. (9) Employees should be transferred at the end of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. (10) Employers should bear medical expenses for employees who fall ill. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., representatives from the labor side and three representatives from the employer side began negotiations. The employer side urged the labor side to resume work first, stating that they would consider the conditions before making a decision. The labor side indicated that if the employer side agreed to improve treatment, there would be no problem with resuming work first. The two sides were very close to an agreement, and a resolution should be reached soon.</p>
<p>Conditions of Mow Tai Workers</p>
<p>The thousand-plus drivers and laborers of Mow Tai Foreign Firm's Shanghai Branch submitted a petition to the firm yesterday, represented by representatives, due to high rice prices and the approaching year-end, which made it difficult to make ends meet. They also presented demands for improved treatment. The Chinese manager, Mr. Song, received them and promised to consider their requests, urging the workers to await a response patiently. The labor side's demands are as follows: (1) Effective immediately, each driver should receive a monthly rice subsidy of six dou, in addition to the existing subsidy.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Improves Treatment; Low-Paid Employees Benefit; Minimum Monthly Wage for Public Servants is Seventy-Two Yuan; Police Officers Can Earn at Least One Hundred and Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's information, this decision to adjust employee treatment will significantly improve the income of general lower-level employees. For example, "Two public servants with a base salary of seventeen yuan can receive a temporary cost-of-living allowance of at least forty yuan, plus a rice subsidy of at least fifteen yuan, for a total monthly income of at least seventy-two yuan. If rice prices rise, their income will increase further. When the price of No. 2 tribute rice is eighty-one yuan and fifty cents, the rice subsidy will be twenty-three yuan and twenty-five cents, so the total monthly income will be eighty yuan and twenty-five cents. As for police officers, because their duties are special, their treatment is even better. Each police officer can now earn at least one hundred and nine yuan per month."</p>
<p>Year-End Approaching; Wage Increases in Various Industries</p>

There are several small villages near that road, and it is rumored that the Japanese military police have dispatched teams to search the area. According to the Japanese authorities, when the incident occurred, Army Medical Second Lieutenant Nomura, along with Corporal Takahashi, four translators, a female nurse, and two servants, were giving injections at the scene.

<h3>Sixth Similarity Between Confucianism and Buddhism: Explaining the Essence of Wisdom; Said to be Witnessing Truth without Attachment</h3>
<p>The Sixth Buddhist Lecture of the Rong Wu Society was given by Mr. Chuan 先, who discussed the similarities between Buddhism and Confucianism. His speech was published in this newspaper previously. In addition to Mr. Chuan's lecture on that day, Mr. Yang Zhongyi also lectured on the sixth point of similarity between Confucianism and Buddhism, which is the sixth of the Six Paramitas, specifically Prajna Paramita. Prajna in Chinese means wisdom, which is witnessing the truth without attachment, that is, awakening to one's nature, naturally understanding virtue, and being the unobscured essence. According to Buddhist scriptures and treatises, it can be further divided into four aspects.</p>
<p>The Principle of Prajna</p>
<p>The Zhi Du Lun says about Prajna: "Of all wisdom, it is the first, the highest, incomparable, unequal, and unsurpassed. It is even more unsurpassed." The Bodhisattva in the Diamond Sutra gatha says, "Spreading treasures throughout three thousand worlds, and holding them as fields of merit, only creates conditioned karma, and does not depart from the realms of humans and gods. Holding the Sutra and taking four verses creates good affinity with the saints, but to enter the sea of suffering, one must use the boat of Prajna." The Great Learning says, "Manifesting virtue throughout the world," repeatedly citing the sentence "manifesting virtue" from the imperial classics of the Great Declaration and the Kang Declaration, concluding by saying, "It all comes from self-manifestation." One must first manifest one's own virtue and then extend it to the utmost, so that all people in the world can manifest their own manifested virtue. Therefore, Mahayana Bodhisattvas vow to universally liberate all sentient beings and must first ride the boat of Prajna themselves.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Prajna</p>
<p>The Manjushri Sutra says, "To abide in Prajna Paramita is to not abide in any dharma, to not abide in any characteristic," "Not seeing any dharma that can be taken or abandoned, nor seeing Nirvana as pleasurable, nor birth and death as hateful," "Practicing Prajna Paramita in this way, one does not see defilements that can be abandoned, nor does one see merits that can be taken." Dharma has no good or bad, because it is apart from all characteristics. Dharma has no high or low, because it has an equal nature. Dharma has no taking or abandoning, because it abides in reality. The Tathagata's perfect enlightenment is self-witnessing emptiness." "When practicing Prajna Paramita, one does not see the characteristics of ordinary people, nor the characteristics of the Buddhadharma, nor the characteristics of the certain existence of all dharmas, nor the desire realm, nor the form realm, nor the formless realm, nor the realm of quiescence, nor the characteristic of the extinction of all dharmas." "Not seeing bondage, not seeing liberation, and not seeing any difference between ordinary people and even the three vehicles, such is Prajna." Prajna is apart from all verbal characteristics, so Heaven does not speak, and Confucius wanted to be silent. "I have nothing to hide from you," yet Zigon sighed that it could not be heard. The sages showed it with their actions and deeds. "The superior man is reverent in his repose, trustworthy in his silence, and the people are encouraged without rewards, and fear without anger." What characteristics can be obtained? The Book of Odes says, "I cherish bright virtue, without loud sounds or colors," and "The music that ascends is without words," and "Do not reveal virtue," and all officials emulate it, so "Sincere respect makes the world peaceful." Zhu Xi said, "Soundless and odorless is the ultimate of non-manifestation," and its meaning deeply resonates with its subtlety. Manjushri Bodhisattva said about Prajna, "Not seeing birth and death, much less loathing or departing." This is the way of the superior man, "Plain and unwearying," and its ultimate is, "Knowing the nearness of the distant, knowing the origin of the wind, and knowing the manifestation of the subtle, one can enter into virtue." The "entering into virtue" of the Doctrine of the Mean is the "manifesting virtue" of the Great Learning.</p>
<p>The Practice of Prajna</p>
<p>If you want to discard the boat of Prajna, you must cultivate the practice of Prajna. If you want to cultivate the practice of Prajna, you must arouse the Bodhi mind. The Flower Adornment Sutra says, "Constantly using this mind to rescue and protect all sentient beings, arousing the Bodhi mind without ceasing," "First, one should abide in the Bodhi mind, and then cultivate all the Buddhadharmas," "The Bodhi mind is like a diamond, the ignorant cannot know it, the unskillful cannot understand it, and the incapable cannot use it." The Bodhi mind cannot be held by the hearers and pratyekabuddhas. "Only those who are interested in Prajna can hold it." This is the "for three months, the heart does not depart from benevolence" that is difficult to achieve. Bodhi is translated as "path," and the new translation is "awakening." Arousing the Bodhi mind is the mind of the path, the mind of awakening. The perilous subtlety between the two is what the sages revere. Confucius told Zeng Shen and Zisi, "My way is one, penetrating all." The "yes" of Zeng Zi is the gradual teaching of the Sage Gate. Yan Hui's "not understanding as if foolish" is the complete teaching of the Sage Gate. The Book of Mencius says, "Heaven gives birth to these people so that the first to awaken will awaken those who are later to awaken. I am one of the first to awaken among Heaven's people, and I will use this path to awaken these people. If it is not me who awakens them, then who will?" "He takes on the responsibility for all under heaven in this way." Therefore, it is said that "It is people who expand the path, not the path that expands people." The "following one's nature and cultivating the path" of the Doctrine of the Mean is the practice of Prajna.</p>
<p>The Benefits of Prajna</p>
<p>The Upasaka Precepts Sutra says, "A layperson who arouses the Bodhi mind is superior to all pratyekabuddha fruits." The Moonlight Samadhi Sutra says, "The Buddha said, 'If there are Bodhisattvas who practice Prajna, there are ten kinds of benefits," even "ten dislikes of the path of hearers and pratyekabuddhas." The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Sincerity is the self-completion of the one who is sincere, and the path is the self-path of the path," "It is not only to complete oneself, but also to complete things," "Completing oneself is benevolence, and completing things is wisdom. This is the virtue of nature." Mencius pitied "Those who follow it for a lifetime and do not know its path are the masses," so he said, "What the superior man is born with, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are rooted in the heart," "Great acts do not increase, and living in poverty does not diminish," "Those who exhaust their hearts know their nature, preserve their hearts, nourish their nature, do not waver in premature death or long life, and cultivate themselves while waiting," "Poverty does not lose righteousness, cultivating oneself in solitude, and success does not depart from the path, benefiting all under heaven." This is the Mahayana Bodhisattva's grand vow and power to liberate all sentient beings, therefore "Only the ultimate sincerity in the world can exhaust the nature of people and things, praise and nurture the creation of heaven and earth, and participate with heaven and earth."</p>
<p>It is said that the next lecture will be on the 20th, given by Mr. Shen Daling, discussing the similarities between the five religions.</p>
<h3>Postal Worker Examination Begins Physical Examinations</h3>

The bureau is now thoroughly reviewing the applicants' resumes. Those who pass will be issued physical examination certificates and are scheduled to undergo physical examinations at designated physicians' offices starting on the 19th. It is rumored that because the successful candidates will be assigned to postal districts in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Anhui, the physical examinations are extremely strict, and it is expected that hundreds of people will be eliminated. The remainder will be allowed to participate in the written examination to be held on January 19 of next year.</p>
<h3>Interference with American Radio Station Reported to U.S. Consulate; Interference Continued During Yesterday's Broadcast; Consulate is Currently Investigating the Matter</h3>
<p>The broadcast of the American-owned China United Broadcasting Station (call sign XMHA) in this city has been constantly disrupted by radio waves emitted in Japanese. The station manager, Mr. Haile, yesterday (the 18th) formally filed a written protest with the U.S. Consulate, requesting attention. According to a U.S. Consulate official, the consulate has received the protest letter and is currently investigating the matter.</p>
<p>News and Music Still Disrupted Yesterday</p>
<p>When China United Broadcasting Station broadcast on the registered wavelength of 600 kilocycles and the temporary wavelength of 640 kilocycles on the evening of the 17th and yesterday morning, it was subjected to strong interference, especially during Mr. Alcott's daily four news broadcasts. The interference continued during the afternoon broadcasts of music and German news. It is generally believed that the disruption of China United Broadcasting Station's broadcasts is orchestrated by the Japanese Radio Management Office in this city. In the past few months, the management office has tried to force most radio stations to limit their power to 200 watts. Those who do not comply with this "request" are disrupted, to the point where all radio stations have to accept the Japanese "request."</p>
<p>French Radio Station Maintains Status Quo</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai Municipal Council election this year, both the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury radio station (call sign XMHC) and China United Broadcasting Station were disrupted when broadcasting news. The French radio station (call sign FFZ) in this city has also been interfered with recently because it refused to comply with the Japanese request to reduce its power. However, the French radio station has maintained its normal power, and the disruption has decreased in recent days.</p>
<h3>Dugu's Body to be Buried this Morning; To be Buried in the Kang Ti Cemetery</h3>

<h3>Wangjia Lane Rushed to Build a New Road; Dispersing 2,000 Families; Previous Demolitions Left 4,000 Homeless; Rickshaw Pullers Alone are Not Allowed to Go to the Western District</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th), Japanese authorities supervised over 200 Chinese workers to rush the construction of a new road from the middle section of Great Western Road, the site where Japanese military policeman Saito was assassinated about three weeks ago, to connect to Great Western Road, and to name it "Saito Road." The original site of the new road was Wangjia Lane, which will be widened and extended. The Chinese residences on both sides will be mostly demolished. It is estimated that about 2,000 Chinese people whose houses will be demolished. It is learned that after another Japanese military policeman was assassinated on Great Western Road two months ago, the Japanese authorities had already implemented a blockade and demolished nearby civilian houses, leaving about 4,000 people homeless.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Alone are Restricted</p>
<p>Most of the restrictions imposed by the Japanese authorities in the Western District this time were lifted on Saturday and Sunday of last week. After the fact, the "Municipal Government" immediately announced that rickshaws in the Western District must obtain "Municipal Licenses." This rule is now being implemented on roads outside the Western District. The Shanghai Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese Consulate and negotiated with the "Municipal Government" regarding this matter this week. However, the "Municipal Government" has stated that all vehicles except rickshaws are allowed to pass through the Western District as usual.</p>

Allied manufacturers purchasing and transporting goods must have certification from the chamber of commerce or industry association at the place of origin, and the Allied Consul General in Shanghai must provide certification respectively. After these goods arrive in Shanghai, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is responsible for directing the industry association to supervise the sales of peers. If there is conduct that supports Japan, it will be severely punished according to law, and foreign exchange will be sold with the Chinese Transportation Bank.</p>
<h3>Fourth Regiment Club Real Estate Sold</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jewish General Association has made a decision regarding the purchase of real estate for the U.S. Navy Fourth Regiment Club. The consideration for this transaction is one million yuan.

All documents for the property have been properly transferred. It is rumored that the Jewish General Association will transfer the property to Kali for resale, but the association authorities deny this, saying that the association purchased the property purely for the needs of the association and not as a speculative transaction.</p>
<h3>Japanese Trucks Forcibly Drive Through Wire Mesh</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the British military authorities stationed in Shanghai agreed with the Japanese military authorities months ago that the wire mesh barriers erected on North Xizang Road would be closed daily from midnight to 4 a.m. Since the implementation, there have been no changes. However, at 12:40 a.m. yesterday (the 17th), five Japanese trucks loaded with vegetables suddenly arrived at the scene. Disregarding the above-mentioned agreement between the British and Japanese authorities, they arbitrarily cut open the wire mesh and allowed the vehicles to pass through, transporting vegetables to the Japanese-controlled "New Central Market" next to the road. The police officers on duty at the scene objected, but were unable to stop them. The authorities are currently considering the possibility of protesting to the Japanese authorities regarding this matter, but it is not yet certain whether a protest will be lodged.</p>

<h3>Major Robbery at Dajicheng Fur Store, Two Key Suspects Arrested: Dismissed Apprentice Conspired with Gang to Plan Fraud and Robbery, Offering Stolen Goods to Wing On Fur Store Led to Case Being Solved</h3>
<p>Chen Xun (22 years old), a dismissed apprentice from Ningbo at Dajicheng Fur Store located at 347 Henan Road, recently associated with bandits. On the afternoon of October 16th of this year, in collusion with Hu Tingjie from Jiangbei and Shen Zhigao and others still at large, they checked into Room 430 of the Yangzi Hotel at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Third Racecourse Road, posing as the owner of the Weiya Restaurant. They called Dajicheng and requested the delivery of</p>
<p>A Large Quantity of Fur Goods</p>
<p>to the room for selection and purchase. The store believed them to be regular customers and suspected nothing. They dispatched two employees, Zhang Jieshuo and another, to deliver an otter fur coat, a lynx fur robe, two sable furs, three gray back furs, and one sea otter fur, with a total value of 33,220 yuan. Upon arrival at the room, they were immediately threatened with guns by the bandits inside and bound and gagged with prepared ropes and cotton in the bathroom, while the fur goods were</p>
<p>Entirely Robbed.</p>
<p>After the incident, the manager of Dajicheng reported the case to the police for investigation. On October 31st, the gang instructed Chen Xun to take the sea otter fur, worth 10,300 yuan, to Wing On Fur Store located at 16 Mintini Road for sale. The shareholders of the store, Lu Ronghua and Dai Shaoting, suspected that the goods were of unknown origin and dared not accept them in the store. Both parties agreed to negotiate in Room 33 of the Carter Hotel on Carter Road, offering 1,600 yuan to buy the fur goods worth over 10,000 yuan. Subsequently, the case was discovered by the Old Zha</p>
<p>Police Station.</p>
<p>It was discovered that the bandit Hu Tingjie danced at the Laoda Hua Ballroom on Marlborough Road every night. A police informant was taken to identify him, and Hu was arrested first. Subsequently, Chen Xun and two receivers of stolen goods were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court for formal prosecution according to law. Judge Chuan Lin presided over the hearing, and the defendants were represented by lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang.

<h3>Robbery on Race Course Road, Resisting Arrest, Police Opened Fire in Pursuit, Thief Abandoned Stolen Goods and Fled</h3>
<p>At 11:45 PM the night before last, a pedestrian, Mr. A, was passing near Race Course Road when he was suddenly stopped by a gang of thieves who threatened him with guns. They stripped him of his coat and were about to flee when they were spotted by two plainclothes Chinese detectives, No. 3432 and No. 1743, from the New Zha Police Station. They drew their guns and stepped forward to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the thief abandoned the stolen coat and the felt hat he was wearing and fled. He fired one shot to resist arrest, and the two detectives returned fire with eight shots. As a result, the thief escaped. Fortunately, it was late at night, and there were few pedestrians, so there were no stray bullets that injured anyone. Only the recovered coat and felt hat, along with the victim, were taken to the police station to report everything.</p>
<h3>Posing as Officials, Defrauding for Money, Zhang Ziqing and Others Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhang Ziqing from Ningbo, also known as Weng Mingchang, colluded with Liu Haoliang from Tongzhou on the 12th and 13th of this month. They posed as Chinese detectives from the Japanese Naval Landing Forces and went to Chen Heji Cotton Shop at 807 Dongyouheng Road, falsely claiming that they knew of a kidnapping case outside the shop but had not reported it. They claimed that someone had reported it to the headquarters, and they were assigned to investigate. The shop owner, Zhang Wenbao, was anxious and asked for a way to avoid prosecution. Zhang and Liu then claimed that to help with this matter, they would need a reward of at least 150 yuan. After negotiation, Zhang agreed to pay 100 yuan to settle the matter. Eighty yuan was paid that day, and fifteen yuan was paid on the 13th, with five yuan still owing. Yesterday, Liu and others went to collect the remaining payment, but Zhang saw through their impersonation and reported it to the police station, who arrested Zhang and Liu. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted for fraud. A request was made for a change of date, and Judge Huang presided over the hearing. The defendants denied posing as detectives to defraud money, claiming that the plaintiff was harboring thieves and asked them to find a way to request exemption from prosecution at the headquarters. After reviewing the facts, the court ordered another hearing.</p>

<h3>The Attitude Towards Reading Classical Chinese</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, "on the first day of school, the child's family had to prepare things like sugar tea cakes and biscuits, and take them to the teacher's 'private school', first offering them to Confucius, and then sharing them with the classmates, so everyone would get to know each other." Although I didn't go through this "ceremony" of "baptism", it is still being performed in the "village schools" in my hometown. The books we started reading were nothing more than "Prodigy Poems", "Thousand Character Classic", "Three Character Classic", "Hundred Family Surnames" and the like. So as long as you are a child who crosses the threshold of the school, there is no one who does not know Confucius. Therefore, it is no wonder people say "Before Confucius, there was no Confucius: After Confucius, there are countless Confucius."</p>
<p>But why do we have to talk about Confucius when we talk about Classical Chinese? Undoubtedly, Confucius is the authority of Chinese classical literature, and the representative of feudal culture. Therefore, when we talk about Classical Chinese, we cannot completely separate ourselves from Confucius. In other words, when we talk about Classical Chinese today, we should pay attention to the social conditions at that time. The current socio-economic structure of China is in a capitalist-oriented semi-feudal situation. Similarly, the political form based on economic conditions has not jumped out of this circle. Therefore, the phenomenon expressed in the cultural field also has this common tendency. Therefore, before the economic base is improved and the political system is refreshed, feudal culture cannot be eradicated. What's more, there are still people who are still singing the praises of "restoring the old" and "reading the classics" in order to "protect themselves wisely," and "pouring oil" on the flames of "driving backwards."</p>
<p>But, we are not saying that "Classical Chinese is useless", but that Classical Chinese cannot be applied to the masses. As for the specialized research of a few people, we do not object either. At the same time, we are not saying that we should be passive, and should keep our mouths shut and not speak. We still have to speak, unless we are forced to be mutes. In fact, even if we are mute, we can still use gestures, and our lips can still move. Therefore, we still have to think positively—how to create the new culture that our era needs. This is the responsibility of our young people. This is to say how to give full play to the uniqueness of the culture itself—to shoulder the responsibility of the times, and to promote the progress of the political system and help the improvement of economic conditions. The two have a reciprocal relationship!</p>
<p>Similarly, when we want to understand Classical Chinese today, and understand the teachings of Confucius, we should have two firm positions: First, we should clearly recognize the difference between the era in which Confucius was born and the era in which we live. Confucius' era was an era in which feudal economy was maturing—the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods—so the culture at that time also needed to be promoted to a stage that was adapted to the economic form. China has now been pushed from a semi-feudal society to a new democratic era by the flames of the War of Resistance, so the cultural sector also needs to be promoted to an advanced stage. Therefore, the task of cultural workers today is to work hard to create a new culture of new democracy, so that it can adapt to the great era of anti-Japanese war. This creative work of culture can be said to be the commonality between Confucius and modern cultural workers in different eras. If we still blindly adhere to the old rules and maintain the old forms of feudal culture—singing praises of "reading the classics", etc.—it seems that we are respecting Confucius in form, but in reality, we are greatly violating the spirit of Confucius, and treating Confucius as an "idol". Conversely, if we do not adhere to the old rules and create a new culture that adapts to the needs of the new era, then, in form, it seems that we are running counter to Confucius, but in reality, we are truly in line with the spirit of Confucius.</p>
<p>Second, we should look at Confucius's teachings with a developing rather than a rigid perspective, and accept the "heritage" of history with rational criticism, retaining or promoting what is good (if it is worth promoting), and simply discarding what is harmful, which is not worth cherishing. As for trying to bring out Confucius's last teachings, and use a few words to treat them as the content to teach the public, it is just a shallow attempt, which has nothing to do with promoting the spirit of Confucius, and is not suitable for the current needs of China. If Confucius is regarded as a puppet in Chinese history to implement enslavement education, it is not only a distortion of Confucius, but also a slander of Confucius, becoming a sinner of Confucius.</p>
<p>Therefore, to "reprint" the Classical Chinese of that time in its original form today and implement enslavement education, the intention is vicious, but the fact of "borrowing a corpse to revive the soul" that we have already seen is spreading day by day. Therefore, it is by no means a meaningless thing to talk about our position and attitude towards Classical Chinese and the teachings of Confucius today.</p>

<p>Tianru said very proudly: "This is their own talent, what credit do I have? Now that I have Shangshu's words, it is like ascending the Dragon Gate, and the reputation has increased tenfold. I also have to ask Shangyi to bestow a few poems on them as a sign of honor." Qian Muzhai smiled slightly and said, "I have just improvised a few poems, and I will send a few more lyrics tomorrow." Liu Rushi then presented the poems written by Muzhai to Zhang Tianru to read. Tianru recited them loudly and praised them with admiration, saying: "These are the works of Li Bai and Du Fu, and others would put down their pens if they were to write them." The Liu sisters each sang a song again, and they drank until late at night. The banquet ended and the lights were extinguished before they dispersed and went home. Muzhai visited Rushi's boudoir again the next day, and gave Liu Rushi a few new lyrics, which Liu Rushi thanked him endlessly for. Accompanying Qian Muzhai, they talked about ancient and modern times, and deeply admired Muzhai's extensive knowledge of history, and had many insights that she had never heard of. After a while, Huang Yuqi came to tell Liu Rushi that Shi Da had already sent a letter to him through him to Jinling to see Hou Fangyu, and then asked Hou Fangyu to send a letter to Shi Da to take to Wuchang, to join Zuo Liangyu's command—to make contributions, and gave him twenty taels of travel expenses. Shi Da had already set off, and asked him to tell her that he would not come to say goodbye. Liu Rushi felt relieved when she heard this news. That night, she accompanied Qian and Huang in her boudoir to drink. No other guests were invited, and Jiang Zi also went out to entertain guests. The three of them drank and talked, each expressing their inner thoughts. After two watches, Huang Yuqi wanted to go home. Xian Muzhai was infatuated with Liu Rushi at first sight, and was reluctant to get up. Liu Rushi did not feel anything, but she already had Chen Wozi in her heart, and she only had respect for Qian Muzhai and no love. Muzhai saw that Liu Rushi did not show any expression, and knew that she was a famous courtesan with a reputation. Although he loved her, it would not be a matter of a day or two to win the favor of the beauty. Therefore, he had to bid farewell to Huang Yuqi. The intention of love was seen by even Xu Da Niang. Xu Da Niang knew that Qian Muzhai was a noble person, and was different from Zhang Tianru. She hoped that Rushi could marry a rich man so that she could get a large sum of money to provide for her old age. But Liu Rushi's heart was still attached to Chen Wozi. Although she was a flower that had fallen into the mire, she was born with wisdom, valued her reputation, admired scholars, and was a very righteous woman. Qian Muzhai admired Songling and came twice, pouring out poetry and wine. It could not be said that he did not have any affection for her. Liu Rushi admired Qian Muzhai's articles very much, so she thought over and over again, wanting to test whether Chen Wozi had true feelings for her, and then came up with a humorous and absurd trick to use as a touchstone for Chen Wozi.

<h3>Learning from "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Jiangcheng</p>
<p>The film "Confucius" gives us satisfaction beyond the usual level. Confucius left us lessons that transcend time. No one can escape the constraints of time and space, but great philosophers often have the awareness and ability to see ahead.</p>
<p>We cannot know what people more than two thousand four hundred years from now will think of us; we cannot become "perfect people" that far into the future in the present. Similarly, we cannot fully measure Confucius of two thousand four hundred years ago with modern standards. Given the amazing speed of human progress, we who live today are truly small and weak. It would be excessive to have endless demands of Confucius from more than two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>We also cannot blindly accept everything about Confucius, just as we do not sympathize with those suffering from a general "enthusiastic immaturity" who blindly try to tear down the Confucian establishment.</p>
<p>What we admire about Confucius is that he was a great philosopher, not because he was a great politician. If we ask, "Why didn't Confucius lead the people to overthrow the autocratic rulers?" it would be better to ask, "Why didn't Confucius promote the Industrial Revolution when he was rich?" After all, the establishment of the Republic of China was only twenty-nine years ago.</p>
<p>Later generations have "suppressed, exaggerated, distorted, slandered, and used" Confucius to an unknown extent. We should no longer harbor the idea of "using" him; we should try to understand and study this ancient philosopher and great scholar, which is more valuable than blindly praising certain celebrities.</p>
<p>Although Confucius himself admitted that he failed politically, it was only a strategic failure (Hitler was a strategic victor, and...). He almost wanted to use the rebellious political opportunity to promote the way of benevolence and righteousness, but it was only a case of "the Master wanted to go," but he did not go. One cannot forget the fundamentals by only focusing on the goal and disregarding the means. At the same time, when he was the magistrate of Zhongdu, the Minister of Public Works, and the Minister of Justice, he also had some political achievements in leading some of the people to do good. Because he always took "benevolence and righteousness as the foundation," the feudal lords would yawn when they heard it. If he had said, "I can fight a battle for you, my lord, and secure the world," the feudal lords would have jumped up long ago. However, for "repelling strong enemies and punishing traitors," his methods were quite ruthless.</p>
<p>"Where sincerity penetrates, metal and stone are opened." A spirit of reckless abandon can produce unexpected power. Just as a soldier kills several enemies on the battlefield and seizes a machine gun with his bare hands, the power that dominates when doing impossible things is often the power of the spirit. We cannot deny Confucius's spiritual teachings.</p>
<p>He was attacked by the people of Kuang in Kuang, attacked by the people of Song in Song, unable to be employed in Lu, unable to be employed in Wei. He could not enter Zheng, he could not enter Jin, the trees were cut down to show danger, and food was cut off in Chen and Cai. Confucius traveled throughout his life, and although he did not have remarkable achievements, Confucius never yielded, he was neither killed nor did he die of cold and starvation. Although his demeanor was stern and somewhat annoying, "death cannot be avoided" and "not sitting improperly" are not bad things after all.</p>
<p>Using films, especially dramatic films, to depict the deeds of a philosopher or inventor can often only capture the spirit. If you really want to explain a theory, it is better to abandon the film and turn to books. After watching "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison, the Man," you still don't know the principle of the electric light; after watching "The Story of Louis Pasteur," you don't understand how Pasteur's vaccine works; after watching "The Magic Bullet," you are still confused about the principle of "Salvarsan." This is not surprising. The same is true for the film "Confucius," and we cannot have excessive demands. However, only excellent works are worthy of serious criticism and worthy of future hope. We should not miss the opportunity to appreciate Confucius, and we should not abandon the responsibility to criticize. But everything that is serious and uplifting will naturally produce a sense of respect and love, just as we hate things that are base and vulgar.</p>
<h3>The Making of the Film "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Fei Mu</p>
<p>— Regarding the Actors</p>
<p>One point worth mentioning about the film "Confucius" is the outstanding performance of the actors. This is an honor for the Shanghai acting community, not my own pride. Standing in the position of a director, to avoid suspicion, it is inconvenient to praise them as much as I want; but the audience will naturally feel it.</p>
<p>In addition to the old Lianhua comrades who have shared hardships for many years, such as Mr. Zhang Yi, Mr. Sima Yingcai, and Mr. Pei Chong, we also obtained:</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Li and Miss Murong Wan'er from the Shanghai Drama Society; Miss Chen Qi and Mr. Tu Guangqi and Mr. Qian Qian from the New Art Troupe; Mr. Tang Huaiqiu and Mr. Li Jingbo, Mr. Ge Xin, Mr. Wu Jingping, and Mr. Tang Qi from the China Travel Troupe; as well as the participation of many enthusiastic colleagues. The cast of the film "Confucius" was truly a selection of the best of the time, which was unexpected at first.</p>
<p>What kind of power could have obtained such widespread support and sympathy is truly inspiring. Moreover, not only those who participated in the work, but several other friends who sought to participate still came to ask me before the last scene of "Confucius" was filmed: "Do you still need people?"</p>
<p>Not caring about remuneration is just the nature of artists, but they even did not compete for roles, regardless of fame or decision, regardless of the plot, regardless of the amount of acting, and completely trusted me. They were all busy people, but when notified today, they would arrive on time tomorrow. Such a work attitude is truly rare. How can I respond to such enthusiasm?</p>
<p>In the character list of "Confucius", they are all actors. If they were called according to the usual term, each one would be a "guest star." The reason is that they work for the sake of work, and each is a 100% dedicated actor—worthy of the word "actor." Calling them "guest stars" would be a commercialized gimmick" and an insult to the artists.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the script, they were not given the opportunity to fully showcase their acting skills, which is truly a pity. Especially for Miss Murong Wan'er and Miss Chen Qi.</p>
<p>The production time of "Confucius" was too long, and many of their screen works (initial decisions) have already been performed in films that were shot after "Confucius," and their talents and acting skills have been proven. This can slightly cover up my sins.</p>
<p>One thing that makes me very excited is that most of the actors who participated this time were initial attempts, and the excellent results they showed were by no means inferior to seasoned veterans. On the other hand, Mr. Zhang Yi, Mr. Sima Yingcai, and Mr. Pei Chong did not show any weakness or inferiority in front of their fellow actors, and were worthy of being "stars." Such cooperation and coordination had never happened before.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Li, Mr. Tu Guangqi, and Mr. Li Jingbo also often inspired me to revise the dialogue during filming, which is very grateful.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Tang Huaiqiu: He has shaped the imagined Confucius into a vivid, fleshy, and character-filled figure. Just the more than thirty times of makeup, six hours each time, the kind of tenacity and perseverance in being loyal to art is enough to be a model for actors.</p>
<p>Finally, I must thank all the actors, including the "extras" who have always been neglected. The so-called "extras" are just that their names are not on any film company's payroll; among them, there is no shortage of real talent. In "Confucius," there are several scenes that are entirely done by "extras," which I deliberately designed, and I believe the audience will not be able to tell.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for not saying a word criticizing the actors. In fact, the entire film is made by the actors, so how can it escape anyone's eyes?</p>
