<h3>義大利與歐戰</h3>
<p>文明的人羣，一致希望歐戰勿拖延，勿擴大；但趨勢所示，勿拖延的希望已絕，勿擴大的希望類絕。</p>
<p>以目前的情形而論，擴大的可能方向在地中海，擴大的是非關頭在義大利。敎皇隔昨虔誠禱告：「祈求上帝保護義大利免於戰禍」，據傳禱告的時候，聲淚俱下；教皇若此禱告，確使任何人萬分同感，亦使任何人更深體認於義大利的殆將參戰。我們不知道上帝將如何主宰？我們不知道主宰義大利的首相墨索里尼氏將如何決策！</p>
<p>在三星期之前，義國外相齊亞諾的機關報電聞報經理安薩爾杜氏向羲國陸軍廣播演說，謂一義國應準備於一二星期內或將爆發戰事」，本報當時嘗推論謂「可以視為北歐戰局勝負，在一二星期內或將分曉」；誠因我們觀察義國態度，必視北歐戰局勝負為轉移：現在英法聯軍不幸在北歐失利了，於是地中海波濤洶湧，義大利盤馬彎弓。這數日，羲國方面一面頒佈追增軍費八十萬萬里拉，即行動用；一面宣佈義軍八十萬枕戈待命，義艦三百四十艘準備在戰事延及地中海時有所動作。凡此姿態，固可視為義國即將有所舉動，至少芬是針對英法在亞歷山大港增防而發，也可視此欲發不發，正是義國對英法有所要挾，原來義國自稱是一個「無」的國家，故對於「有」的國家的英法，一直就滿腹牢騷，但願乘機勒索，以冀滿足它的經濟利益與領土慾求。他與德國在戰前是同調，在戰時也維持其密切關係；所不同的，德國是用武力來完成它的目的，而義大利則是等待德國的勝利，從中達到它的目的。義國法西黨的代言人蓋達曾指出義國需要不外兩端，其一需要自由與豐饒的空間，以供義國人民發展之用，俾得在義國領土內和平工作，其二義大利民族需要生活與行動的自由，應有排除一切外國控制的制度。前者是指地中海兩岸的利而言，後者是指地中海與蘇彝士連河的權而言。在表面的態度上，表示義國有爭取這兩種需要的力量，他口口聲聲的業已準備參戰，便是此意。換一方面說，亦即表示假使英法能滿足他所需要的，則義　從此可以由和平工作而生活了，亦即不參戰了。然則英法如何？</p>
<p>英法現在把艦隊移往地中海，不能視為英法給義大利要索的答復，亦不能視為英法威脅義大利。原來達拉第氏治下的法國，一切追隨英國張伯倫氏，而對義妥協，是張伯倫始終一貫的政策。一見於義帝國的承認，再見於西班牙事件的妥協。最近從荷京傳來的消息，也謂英國覓取與義聯絡，以求獲得諒解；對於義國在地中海的地位，以及在蘇彝士運河的航運，都願加考慮。但是，英法對義國，並沒有最好的信用，故英國所表示的玫慮，並不能取得義國的信任：况且所謂玫慮，亦並不能解釋為予義國以滿足。而美國總統羅斯福氏的和平努力，以及表示不願戰爭擴大於地中海，當然可以使墨索里尼氏加多一番攷慮，但在分量上不夠促使墨氏心迴意轉！</p>
<p>據英法方面的宣傳，最近德國加强了對義國的壓力，、使義國不得不更傾向德國了。這一類說法，不是欺人之談，便是隔靴搔癢之談。義國在此歐戰的中途，決非接受壓迫的，大的也不會雪中送炭而支持被壓迫的；最可能的態度，還是錦上添花而參抓壓迫工作吧！要是數天前北歐戰事的情况，英法佔了絕對優勢，我們深信地中海至今還是風平浪靜。不幸北歐戰况小如英法所願，猶幸英法在北歐未算一敗塗地，祗是失利，故戰爭是否擴大到地中海方面，還留着一些徘徊的餘地。所可焦盧的，事實不容長此徘徊。至於如何發展，如何趨蹄，茲不願多論，而英法的不得不更艱苦犧牲，則在此歐戰中途、便可斷言了。</p>
<h3>中日戰事　將形成消耗戰　美報謂華兵力強大　現局似為大戰序幕</h3>

<p>決不妥協抗戰到底</p>
<p>訪蔣委長時、曾叩及中國自製飛機及。砲之可能　、蔣委長答　、中國政府將照　定桯序、實現此項計劃、又據上級官塲人士　稱、日本曾請蔣委長之親信轉達、以圖與蔣委長上所接治、蔣委長對日方建議、置諸不理、　　企圖、因已失收、政府人士、　坦白承認中國因戰爭結果、、　損失非輕、惟中國朝野現　一種共同觀念、可以　語綜述之、即「不與敵人妥洽、決計澈底進行抗　　　、以求　興」　、</p>
<p>經濟機構日趨穩定　　中政府人士承認中國之最後勝利、唯（一）金錢、（二）軍火、（三）人力與（四）汽車運輸四要素是擊、其最嚴重者、厥為包涵全國經濟組織之金錢問題、惟官方深信「自由中國」之經濟情况、能藉統制辦法、重加調整、工廠與民衆、大舉遷移中國西南部、致社會機構起激變、使政府遭遇許多難題、然情勢現已逐漸好轉、假以時日、即可在經濟與社會上重行調　、而　一般情勢、更趨穩</p>

<h3>提存風潮平息　金融愈臻穩定　外滙經維持後昨已放長財部擬訂辦法取締投機</h3>
<p>路透社六日香港電、華方重要銀行界人士、今日告路透訪員稱當局雖已於星期四日、從上海滙市撤回對法幣外匯統制的支持、但有對法幣表示懷疑者、則殊無理由、此種懷疑、出自投機者之活動、其不負責任之行動、定遭舉世唾罵、華方當局極有賡續支特法幣之意　、最近撤回支持、僅係暫時性質、自不待言、平準基金所可支配之現有存銀、已稍增加、故當局深信足以處理滙兌局勢、</p>
<p>自中國政府聲明決心維持幣制、穩定外匯、銀錢兩業公會切實否認限制提存後、昨日市塲稍趨穩定、人心漸安、但謠言尙未完全平息、新聲社記者昨特往訪銀行公會秘書及錢業公會某委員、據談、所屬會員行莊自市塲謠傳將再度限制提存後、即於上星期凖備一切、目前環境雖艱苦、幸銀錢業實力充足、故應付裕如、外傳星期日銀錢業開緊急會議之說、實屬不確、望各界切勿輕信謠言、以免中奸人之陰謀、</p>
<p>滬市查金仍待疏散</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晤某銀行界領袖、據談、上上海租界之秩序與安全、相當得以維持不墜、故戰事中各地避難民衆、咸視上海為世外、桃源、兩年半以來、愈聚愈衆人之所聚、資金隨之增加所以上海之資金、益見充斥、雖資金移植西南之論、年來甚　　上、銀錢同業中實行者雖不少、但大規模之移植、恐非一蹴可幾、所以宜如何統籌並顧、疏散上海之資金、使其運用得循正軌、其尙有待更進一步之努力、金融界應以身作則、使金融漸入正軌、則可不負政府之期望、</p>
<p>金融界應以身作則　　並謂上海之經濟繁榮、則有背於戰時國策、金融界竟不加袖察、而僅以本身表面利益為前提、盡量資助、或用其他便利方法、以促成淪陷區經濟之畸形發展、結果則為違背戰時國策應有之方略、且有若十金融界竟買賣外匯黃金、囤積日用必需品、以圖已利、此種情事、實有違政　禁令、所以期望金融界、應　念政府戰時金融支持之不易、與民族生命之百年大計、而有以自悟其所應有之責任、從速停止經營不正當之業務、以免助長投機、影響民生、</p>
<p>外滙放長黃金仍漲</p>
<p>前因平凖外匯　金委員會限制供給上海黑市外匯、以致市塲匯率猛縮、投機者紛紛扒進、昨晨英商匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英匯三便士一二五長一二五、美匯四元五角、長一八七五、對各業正當需要、已尤供給、同時市塲上認為香港平凖外匯基金委員已出而維持、所以實際交易市較匯豐掛牌為　、惟黃金市、因投機者搜羅、竟背外匯涨、上午收盤六千九百六十五元、下午收盤七千零十元、關於中央銀行之法定外匯掛牌、依然如舊、絲毫未動、</p>
<p>提存平息金融趨穩</p>
<p>昨日（星期一）各行莊於上午九時開市後、一般存戶因證實謠傳限制提存之不可靠、故向各行莊提取存款者並不多、同時金融市塲、因平凖外匯基金委會之維持、以及中中交農四行之拆放、銀錢　　　會　之　劑、所以已趨穩定、並聞財政部方面、對上海黑市外匯、甚為重視、已會同經濟部籌謀補救方法對投機買賣外匯以及囤積日用必需品者、決予究辦、切實取締黃金暗市非法買賣、以蘇足困而維治安、</p>
<p>法院奉令嚴加取締　　又　昨日探悉、自上星期黑市外匯發生劇變後、本埠第一特區及第二特區法院、曾接獲重慶方面之訓令、飭令對投機操縱及囤積居奇等情、嚴加取締、凡業經獲得確實證據者、法院可判以長期或至少五年之徒刑、</p>
<h3>物價激涨　購買力激减　商市外强中乾已成强弩之末</h3>
<p>滬市物價威脅嚴重、商　外强中乾、愈益暴露、昨據布業某領袖稍、滬市物價創歷來未有之高峯、民生困難、達於極點、各業商市亦顯受深刻影響、現除米煤麵粉等生活必需品照可節省外、其余均已缺乏購買力、即以布疋而言、亦屬民生必需品之一種、但棉紗售價、一再昂涨、通常布疋、已涨通昔日之綢價、市民三餐不繼、安有餘力添置衣着、是以各同業營業額、莫不顯著减退、其餘各種百貨業、殆無不若是、長此以往、商市蕭條、工廠减工、實工商業前途重大隱憂、値此當局即將實行加捐之際、甚望站在市政當局立斱、亟謀挽救狂瀾之道、以培稅源、而維市面、</p>
<p>當局態度　　據可　方面消息、兩租界當局對連日物價之飛漲、將採取相當之措置、以制止商人之投機與操縱、其計劃（一）創設一食糧產銷合作機關、辦理產銷、（二）發貼佈告、曉諭市民、據法租界警務處當局稱、自四月十五日起至五月一日止、在八十家商店中、曾查出二十三家違反規定、處以二百元之罰金、</p>
<p>使用法律　　目前法租界當局、正在盡力使市塲置諸其管轄之下、使各界市民對之嚴予注意、以在市塲中之物價、往往較諸商店中為低、故如市民能對此　加以注意、嚴密指摘、物價或可因之而下跌、又據工部局助理秘書格勃氏稱以往兩租界當局限制物價、可謂均告失敗、故認為有使用法律之必要云云、此意乃謂利用經濟情形變動而造成違乎常情之漲價、兩租界當局過去所採措置、確未能收效、故如黑匯仍繼續緊縮、制定法律以限制物價、實有必要矣、</p>
<p>食糧問題</p>
<p>兩租界當局現對食糧及麵粉、最為注意、據調查、本市棧存米尙有七八〇·〇〇〇包、足以供給本市市民六個月之用、去冬規定之米價、最高為四十元、但目今米價　飛涨至五十四元、本埠公共租界與法租界物價平準委會、已定於本星期內召開聯席會議、商討此事、又米業認為以往米糧限價失敗之原因、大半為來源稀少及日人在滬郊之限制、故希望建立一產銷合作之機關可使本埠交易雙方、齊集一堂、在租界當局之監視下、以最低廉之價格交易、惟此事目前尙　至籌備成熟之時期、</p>
<p>平售煤球</p>

<h3>外幣頓起回風</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金錢跌後又漲、卒告續漲二元、英美金蔡均以黑市外滙、經港電維持後、市勢頓吿鬆硬、各方需要激减、前者退爲六十八元、後者初做二十一元五六角、繼而步退至二十元五角、午爲二十一元、午後又會高至二十一元八角、卒爲二十一元一角、比上週六亦小四角、香港票隨港滬滙兌遽落、法郞票略疲、新加坡票及羅比票均甚軟弱、安南票及坎拿大票則頗有需要、市價一致上漲、意大利票及澳金票均久未成交、昨日稍有交易、市價較前計意大利票漲二角、澳余票猛升十二元三角、日金票各方供給又旺、市價因又趨下晚市退爲一元二角七分五厘、朝鮮票則稍有需要、晚市已與法幣平掉、</p>
<h3>滙劃貼現回落</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、轉見回落、每千元初做貼進者須二百十元、貼出者還一百九十元、供給漸多、遂步落至一百五十元、午刻回上至一百七十元左右、下午略升至一百七十五元、比上週六低卅五元、錢業公會拆息、晨午兩市均未更、仍掛二角五分、</p>
<h3>先撳後抬　金市極度不安　頂盤見七二五〇元　有五百四十元上落</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、先撳後跳、跌少漲多、惟人心恍惚、買賣意志不堅、故料七千元錢上、或有一度盤旋、晨初以匯市遽鬆、由開盤六千八百元、再跌至七百十元、時聞金號售出、但頃因外匯回軟、趨勢即轉、銀號帮及金號等先後撈入、迨午刻已好達六千九百七十元、雖午收時某金號撳價拋　而徵挫、豈知塲外因歐洲戰事謠傳利多、金號猛抬、竟越出七千元、做過七千〇三十元、後市外匯報緊、開盤七千一百元、且不久竟創見七千二百五十元空前新高峯、中以金號猛進、獨占鰲頭、後另一證券帮與某金號出籠、兼滙市稍回、價遂步落、曾回達七千元關口、惟收盤則爲七千〇十元、較上週末適好一百元、全天交易的四千兩有餘、銀樓飾金、時跌時漲、結果掛大二十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤尚漲一百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩），初開匯市報鬆、人心稍挫、開市即小一百十元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲六千八百元，嗣再因金號力賣、冉跌九十元、達六千七百十元低價、惟成交極少、旋銀號帮吃胃漸强、搜入有數、市勢轉向七游、不久即吿回出六千八百元大關、後匯市忽報轉軟、人心更振、證券帮等紛來購入、　高數十元、銀號對做十兩、為六千九百元、後以錢兌業多頭乘機說手、而買戶漸見减少、復步落百元、錢兌業出銀號三十兩、爲六千八百元、顧因此時金號後來拖入、兼及銀號帮亦競向搜買、且滙市仍報走緊、竟飛躍一百七十元、銀號進金號等數十兩、均爲六千九百七十元、將近收盤時、某金號不顧市價撳價拋出、遂吿六千九百六十五元收盤、收後另一金號猛抬、據聞歐洲消息利多、賣戶裹足不前、竟抬至七千〇三十元、且中以成交極少、午後匯市報緊、人心尤昂、一開即跳至七千一百元、後再加金號及散戶等搶買、又飛漲一百五十元、金號進銀號三十兩、爲七千二百五十元空前高價、少頃買者减少、賣勢頓濃、遂逐漸回降、步落至七千二百元、市勢一度轉靜、略帶盤旋、後匯市轉硬、賣風擴大、金號證券帮競塞、不久即小二百元、金號出證券帮二十兩、爲七千元、其時某錢兌業與搶帽子者頻撈、當高至七千〇八十元、人後終因金號再來沽出、散戶止買爲拳、復又回小七十元、證券帮出金號二十兩、爲七千〇十元作晚收價、結果比上週六軋漲一百元、全天五百四十元上落、</p>
<p>飾金掛大二十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸七百元、迨至九時半掛小十元、十一時半掛大十元、十二時又高十元、十二時十分冉大十元、午後二時又好十元、三時始回小十元、此後無變化、結果計大二十元、大同行改懸七百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　洋股活躍　交易激增</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、仍係多方雖在掙扎、依然未能抬頭之象、環培謠言紛起、瞬息萬變，人心爲之震撼、動盪不寗、謹愼者大都縮手、爲銀根所迫、則大都賣出、空方抵補、寥寥無幾、做多尤　稀少、蓋以放款月息高至四五分、故公債市價萎頓、交易因此亦大减、上午同順賣出較多、聯和天生亦有出脫、昌記及同裕略有買進、午後同細變出仍多，聯和亦權續脫手、信孚鴻大多頭稍有了結、元康穗孚及散戶買進、市仍係由高轉　之狀、結果高低互見、爲數紙五分一角至二角半而已、成交數日祇五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後，</p>
<p>股票交易成交漢冶萍股二百股、價爲四元二角半、衆業公所股市開盤、大形活潑、交易逐增、價較上週五收盤高起多多、當天風波不大、趨勢彌堅、一時似無回頭之象、</p>
<p>英聯股交易復佔實業股中首席、成交計有五萬二千一百股、價較上星期收盤亦上升最多、一度見七十五元、收盤七十三元有買戶、餘股之受衆愛戴者、爲國際·祥泰等、</p>
<p>業廣股成交龐大、但價格變動至微、見十七元四角高價後、回至十七元二角收盤、出售之股、被吸最易、</p>
<p>會德豐股自昨日起、所有價格、概標以「除權」二字、其「新股權」則另有買賣行市、因此項錯綜關係、始時引起一般人躊躇、致交易久久未曾做開、蓋經營者非略費思索、不易決定、二者間之連繫價値、俾與上週收盤時之「速權」股價作一比較、移時除權股一百三十元有成交、新股權則做一百元、牧盤價、前者爲一百三十一元、後者九十八元、新股權之購者每股須付二十五尤於公司、如此每一新股本金、合計一百二十三元、惟此項新股之計息、須自四月一日以後、前此公司營業利得不與也、而舊股雖確數未知、信其尙有一末期股息可派、此點購者不可小明、則是現在二種股價間之差、直可視爲市塲想像中之舊股末期股息矣、</p>
<p>橡皮股需求甚殷、各股走勢、概極活潑、但各股價格、並不同比例的上漲、下列數種、尤覺顯著、</p>
<p>英渣華前收爲五十六元、昨爲六十元、英古達區前收爲二寸九元、昨爲三十一元半、蘭格志前收爲三十九元、昨爲四十七元、橡皮前收爲三十七元二五、昨爲三十九元二五、上列各橡樹公司、悉在荷屬東印度、故其能受人歡迎、唯一原因、無疑的、爲此等公司可不受匯兌限制條例約束、如其他多家英屬馬來亞諸公司然、</p>
<h3>糧食　滙水稍平　洋米拋出驟旺</h3>
<p>米市自因金價意外暴漲後、當時漲勢之烈、似難遏制、詎市多變幻、金市滙水已定、已見跌風、晨間初開進出有限、市面尙稱平穩、旋聞金價回落滙水放長、於是變化即起、求脫之聲遍傳市塲、籌碼擁擠、滿塲你拋吾甩、相五競先脫手、一時形勢紊亂、市失準則、跌價參差、若小絞則連陞三級、而西貢則立貶九仭、蓋小絞近因全由投機把持、最爲活絡、雖起伏迭出、終是大漲小跌、故昨最低價猶爲四十八元八角、迄收盤仍達四十九元半、較之週前收價五十元僅貶半元光景、其他各貨則情形逈異、處斯實銷小暢、而父爲心思所輕視、遂致積貨小動、軼出常軌、直瀉二三元、往常較小絞娘提三四元或一二元者、茲則其售價迨將與小絞相埒、計收盤一號西貢祇五十元、二號四十九元左右、一號暹　及火絞四十九元半、而二號暹暹更覺低賤、較小絞竟短元外、僅開四十八元三四角至四十八元、此種畸形發展、誠屬心思交易之歸宿、曩昔鮮見者也、碎尖與米　所幸市貨不多、猶能獨樹一幟、無甚上落、　邏米　高者尙售四十五元半至四十五元、碎尖特自四十三元二角次至四十元</p>
<p>粳米內地來源、復因受交通影響、抵埠轉稀、而銷塲方面雖若厚薄粳傳塲外暗盤獵開尙旺、然亦受洋米牽制、步低元許、無錫特淸粳五十一二元、粉粳五十元、常崑粳五十一元至五十元、中宿者四十七八元、靑泗特薄五十元、次至四十八元半、南港早稻高自四十九元半决至四十八元、</p>
<p>糯米去路本滯、際此疲檔、尤覺乏神、故開金溧　元已爲四十三半至四十三元、丹常貨四十一二元、次至潮軟者三十九元半、比之前盤計貶一元有奇、</p>
<p>洋米昨市已轉平坦、蓋連日飛黃騰達、完全爲投機者所造成、實際上正式交易反爲觀望、昨市塲交易、仍爲投機所活動、故市價倐升倐落、瞬息變化、然以滙水鬆軟、結果米價略見回平數角、現洋米以小絞最旺、上落不一、早市開價五十元零三角漲至五十元零半後、立即瀉降至四十八元七角、午後一度上漲後、結果小至四十九元四角、尙無受主、其他各米莫不互見出入、回籠二號西貨自五十九元開價至六十元、下午收價五十九元七角、又星軟弱、已到小紋原包五十八元三角半至四角、全日現米成交八九千包、回籠原包則有六百多噸、</p>
<p>又訊洋米昨日到滬、計有五千一百七十二包、係怡和洋行裕生輪自香港運來、</p>
<h3>粉市堅定　—麥仍擯持—</h3>
<p>昨日二號粉廠盤仍爲十四元、各廠以上週已連漲兩次、不再增高、惟回籠貨籌碼缺乏、執持者猶視爲奇貨、不願輕脫、喊價比廠盤高三四角、但無正式成議、統市成交、除廠家直接批出五六千包外、祇有內地粉稍有交易、據說內地粉報運滬粉爲便、故本客去化亦較活動、無錫廠出品之順風牌初開十四元三角、後市十四元二角半至二角成交的有二三千包、市面漸趨堅定、</p>
<p>又麵粉大批北運、今日太古公司重慶輸赴華北、自本市運往烟台麵粉一萬包、運往靑島六千五百包、聞均係廠貨、又有洋苞三千包、運往烟台、</p>
<p>小麥昨日賣買仍擯持、市亦無甚榮辱、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷冷澹　紗市回鬆　雙馬跌三十元</h3>
<p>紗市因連朝在騰、昨則外滙轉趨放長、人心穩定、市面回見鬆懈、但有一部份心理、因歐洲戰局未止、地中海形勢尙緊張、劉於多頭觀念仍不放棄、惟實銷甚滯耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因美滙軟弱、塲中買戶缺乏、市象轉挫、二十支雙馬期貨價爲一千七百四十元、立刻漲至一千七百七十元、現貨雙馬價爲一千七百二十元、朱幾聞黃金下落、實銷冷淡、又復下降至一千六百六十元、收盤稍回上、查半日間成交統計一千五百九十五包、行情一十支雙馬跌三十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、一〇〇　香港四八五</p>
<p>內地　一〇　統計一、五九九</p>
<h3>匯兌緊縮後　棉商有止裝定貸者</h3>
<p>本棉交易不旺、但趨勢殊緊、此因存貨日枯、人心堅昂、所以售價緩步前進矣、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>火草包二四四·〇〇　同行進一　一三五包</p>
<p>又二四七·〇〇　又　三〇〇包</p>
<p>杜力拉二九三·〇〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>平果爾二二八·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>米特林三三〇·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>蘭工二九二·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>康江二九〇·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、較爲靜寂、一部份之海外棉商及空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、近期跌落一二磅音、遠期漲三五磅音、印度棉市，昨日連同預測降落二羅比餘、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因銀根奇緊、故交易較爲靜寂、但各方以市上現貨甚少、售價仍駡堅昂、但按照目前之匯兌價折算仍廉去百分之十五强、同業間有以匯兌緊縮、故向海外止裝或略貼損失、由洋行方面購回者、約有千餘包之數、按照一般之意見、不論將來匯兌之長或縮、棉花之售價總屬步高也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯四元半折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　八七·九五</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級三七二·八〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　四〇三·六〇</p>

<p>四十二支　又　下級四〇六·五〇</p>
<p>印棉一千零五十件、裝大英公司希里拉號輪、自孟買運來、前日到滬停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　投機進出忙碌　市盤午後又昂</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市以實際交易仍無發展、投機者進出甚忙碌、市盤隨金價起伏頻仍、各貨晨布開價平定、午後市勢較堅、結果白貨粗布粗斜每疋漲二角半至五角、秋令藍布廠方訂價甚昂、而淺色貨以時令關係、售價欲漲無力、本街成交七百餘件、粵閩　進色布色斜一百餘件、浙贛帮亦辦百餘件、查疋頭今有三十七件、運往香港、</p>
<p>東布　晨開市氣甚銳、龍頭細布爲五十五元二角半、但以實銷寥落、瞬即下挫、最小價到過五十二元二角半、後市因金價續升、同業進意轉佳、逐步復昂、故收市時之龍頭細布爲五十四元二角半、本月份五十六元半、嗶嘰現出增至一元五角四分二五、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆餅旺銷　黃豆又升</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市面、雖油市疲落、但因豆餅銷路活潑、（價猛漲三四角、由汕頭泉州　化等辦去二萬片、）故脚地因之鞏固、行情續升四五角、由南洋幫搾油廠香港等成交安慶豆六百五十餘包、蕪湖豆六百七十包、南京豆二車、太倉豆一百四十包、揚州山黃一車、蚌埠豆二車、丁家州豆四百餘包、張堰杜豆一百四十包、大連夾靑七十包、價詳市價欄、七日運香港豆子三千一百包、豆餅一千八百噸、</p>
<h3>糖市　漳刁靑　劃申須七十元</h3>
<p>昨日糖市據荷蘭電、粗砂微小一角二分半、C.I.F.&amp;.K.G.例、荷幣八·四二五、本市公會劃盤、鬆落二三角、二四粗白現貨本棧七十六元四角至七元、外棧新到貨七十六元三角、下午成交較旺、故升至七十七元二角、老貨七十六元、下午七十六元半、轉口六十元、太古車白續緊、B嘜西棧八十七元、計升七角、HY喀八十五元半、H嘜赤新貨六十三元、老貨六十二元半、荷老六十七元、計升一元、轉口五十五元半、本廠雪白七十六元半、本冰九十元半、晶明冰九十二元、國糖漳刁靑據產報訊近一星期之間、在漳每擔價漲起二十元以上、在厦每擔漲起十元强、尙見缺貨、故劃申須七十元、食糖今（七日）有五百包、運往天津、</p>
<h3>五金　津靑幫稍有採辦</h3>
<p>昨日五金因外匯平穩，漲風見平、而同業實銷依然淸淡、惟天津帮及靑島帮稍有採辦、而本街之製罐廠·玩具廠·印刷廠·及熱水瓶廠等、亦略見活動、全市有近千担之交易、其所辦者有平白鐵·本廠釘·竹節鋼條·黑鐵坯子·二十六號大馬口鐵·九十磅一百磅小馬口鐵·新盤元·方光條·白鐵板白鉛絲·新鉛絲·洋元頭·及一百八十磅之雙連意美馬口鐵等開價大抵與前市相仿若黑鐵坯孑一千三百元、亦有拋出、較一千四百元、已落一百元、一百八十磅　雙連馬口鐵二百四五十元、亦肯出售耳、</p>

<h3>美國敎育界　發生軒然大波　羅素博士被法院判決　不准在紐約學院授課</h3>
<p>英國著名哲學家兼數學家羅素博士、原係英國伯爵、但他敝屣尊榮、寗願以平民自居、他現在美國加里福尼亞大學担任哲學敎授、今年二月二十六日、紐約市立學院聘請他從明年二月份起担任該校哲學敎授、每年束修八千美元、茲有凱夫人者、其子女二名已屆入學年齡、曾於三月十九日以納稅市民資格向紐約市高等敎育委員會請願、藉口羅素提倡「不道德的誨淫的自由戀愛學說」爲理由、要求解除其聘的、紐約州最高法院推事麥克季亨已於三月三十日宜判、以聘任羅素担任市立學院敎授、匪特「有玷學風」、且係「侮辱紐約市居民」爲理由、指令該市高等教育委員會解除羅素聘的、</p>
<p>判決公文長十七頁、並說明按照紐約州敎育法、羅素旣未取得美國公民資格、即不能在該州授課、紐約市高等敎育委員會未經考試手續、即核准羅素聘的、亦屬違反紐約州憲法、其「最令人難堪者」厥爲此種聘任、對於「人民的公共健康。安全·與道德、均有妨害」、</p>
<p>該案宣判後、凱夫人稱之爲「紐的市每個父母的勝利、也是正義與清白的勝利」羅素敎授已從洛杉磯加州大學來電聲明、「在這個階段不欲表示、正向律師徵求意見」、高等敎育委昌會方面是否上訴、也不得而知、美國民權保障同盟已電羅素、表示願爲聲援、最先在三月一日向報紙表示公開函、攻詰羅素的孟寗主敎、「在這時期、也不願發表意見」</p>
<p>加州大學副校長郝特列克博士則謂、該校對於羅素的學問與敎授法、並無訾議、他擬在今春離校完全出於自動、加州學生刊物編輯裴恩表示意見說、「道件事是美國敎育的悲劇、紐約州法院判決羅素無資格在該州敎書、實屬不知所云、我所受業的敎授、實無出羅素之右的、他的學生聽到這種判決、必定憤憤不平、加州大學如能設法挽留羅素、全體師生一定是歡迎的、我在羅素所担任的課程學習兩門、從來沒有聽見他涉及任何道德問題」</p>
<p>羅素的三續夫人巴屈麗西亞說、「我們是在異地作客、不知法律手續、此後如何進退、當由紐的方面律師依法辦理、我們雖不願多事、但也無法、這案的癥結是一個民權與敎學自由的問題、有關無數智識份子、到這步田地、我們是不能默爾而息的」、羅素的學生正向加州大學當局請求挽留、他的同事也多起而爲他辯護、加州哲學敎授雷欽巴區博士說、「我們都知道羅素敎授是當代大哲學家、紐約法院這種判決、實屬駭人聽聞」、羅素的學生貝蒂特說、「有機會、聽到羅素博士講學、實在難能可貴他確是一位高尙學者、我的道德絕未被他敗壞」、</p>
<p>麥克季亨推事將判決書分發各報記者時會說、他漏夜硏究羅素著作之後、始作成這判決書、其中最初六頁說明公民資格與考試問題、其餘十一頁則指斥羅素對於性的行爲所抱的見解、並引證羅素所著四部書中的理論、作爲根據、判決書結論說、「師資對於薰陶學生的思想、比較各種名詞、尤有力量、假定聽任羅素在市立學院敎書兩年、而不宣傳他的主張、也足違反上面上書的學規、羅素的哲學及其行爲直接牴觸紐約州刑法、敎學自由一種權利決不許被人用作貽誤靑年違反刑法的幌子」云、（譯三月三十一日紐約Herald　Tribune)</p>

<h3>迎春禮</h3>
<p>迎春雖古禮，而儀仗則各處從同，杭垣今歲迎春，較往年更形繁褥，亦昇平之景象也。正月十三日，天氣晴和，遊觀者自慶春鬥至十字路普安街，以及橫河橋石牌樓，凡三四里，幾無立足處。是日三分府及一府二縣，各朝衣朝冠，排全副孰事，至撫轅賀春，隨乘煖轎出慶春門，至上新廟，先行春耕禮，然後恭迎芒神入城，各官則換坐顯轎，至撫轅辭歸，芒神則向各衙門徧遊，次日解往吳山太歲廟供奉，以復故位。當迎春時，的已午初，金鑼震響，笙管和鳴，首則彩亭數座，亭中例設花瓶等物，次則金字牌十數對，皆風調雨順，五穀豐登等字。隨有抬閣四座，每座上各坐二人，裝爲八仙模樣，隨後則紙牛一隻，扛抬而至，牛身之顏色，與春牛圖所繪同，後隨一人，牽一活牛徐行，蓋即太歲所耕之牛也。人見之，爭拔其毛，以爲利市。午後例有春官一人，往往混跡人叢，無從辯認；蓋緣杭人見春官，爭先亂打，謂之打春。　　明日刋登　迎春禮（二）</p>

<h3>做世界的人　（三）</h3>
<p>怎麼辦呢？科學是價理，必然要保存的。那來，剷除匈吧。用什麼方法剷除他呢；老實說，我們都有這種匈的脾氣，我們狹窄，自私，殘忍，不過程度上有等差而已。我們要剷險他，　非要劃除人類嗎？這一點辦不通，我們只得求其次，就是把狹窄的人，改造成　火的人，矮小的人，改造成巨人，匈人式的，重生成爲上帝一般。故如今的人所需要的有如下三事：（一）一個世界的頭腦，人的腦想，不在深而在寬。匈人的頭腦是狹窄的，上帝式的人，頭腦是寬宏的。若你要知一個人頭腦的寬窄，只要研究他所做的　吿。如某人爲我們轉吿四次便不再轉吿，你價知他頭腦的寬狹了。多數的人是這樣禱吿：一如　兒在校，珍兒在辦公室，母在廚房，父在工廠，阿們，」殊不知需要我們代　的豈止這幾個人？所以，主我訓我們福吿，要說「我們的父，」「我們的飲食」「我們的罪」這「我們」二字包括所有的人而言。美國新近出了一本雜誌，名爲「世界現狀」從世界的觀點，討論一切問題，我們　了這本雜誌，我們的頭腦。就要减爲世界的頭腦，我們轉吿時，就不致限於自家人，凡黑，白，紅，黃，各色人等，都要包括在我們轉吿裏面，這是令人最大的一種需要。（二）一顆世界的良心，凡人都有良心。不過，有些人的良心是窄的，在某地某事上有良心，在別處便沒有良心。如某人不願偷其母的東西，但是他却趁機打劫隣舍的財物，像這樣的良心，實爲社會安寗的種威脅。（待續）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>從人種學上談　中華民族的體質</h3>
<p>— 南君</p>
<p>處於血肉紛爭的今日，弱肉强食，似已成爲演化的公例，我大好中華民族之任人蹂躪，更爲不可掩飾的事實，亡國滅種的外壓與危急，誰亦知道到了最嚴重的關頭。我們固然要咬緊牙根，發揮最大的抗爭力量，踏上光明的大道，來求得人間的自由與平等。可是有些憂國之士，往往會想起種族上的懷疑問題，就是說：「中華民族的優劣究竟怎樣」？的確，國運的興替，種族的盛衰，是具有各種複雜的因子，但就民族的本身來論，也在道些因子之間，佔有一個重要的位置。我們暫不討論精神文化方面的事實，目站在人種學的觀點上，把民挨的體質來分析一下，知道我們自己的體質在世界人　裏的情况，這也是一件有意義的事。</p>
<p>中華民族的體質，根據已知的材料，揆諸人類分類的規準來加以分析，便可以得到下面的各項結果。這些由人類學家給我們的貢獻，實在也是一　般人了解自己應該知道的常識。爲明朗計，分述如次。</p>
<p>身材　我國人的高度，由北而南，河北人身高平均爲一九六〇糎，廣東人一六一八糎，得差數七十二糎，其他各省則介於這兩個極端之間。由此可知我國人的身材有最高，高，中等三種情形，同時更可以說國人身高與地理緯度成正比例。要是和世界人類相比，那是列入「中等」的地位。</p>
<p>頭形　頭形是人類分類的最要標準，普通分爲三種，依照頭指數來分析。我國人長頭佔百分之一四·四一，中頭佔白分之四二·一四，寬頭佔百分之四三·四七。就地理分布而論，北方多長頭，稱爲黃河式；中部多中頭，稱爲長江式；南方多寬頭，稱爲珠江式。頭形的大小和腦容量很有關係，在演化上觀察，寬頭與中頭的進化程度較高。</p>
<p>毛髪　我國人的頭髮是一種粗長的直髮，很少有捲曲和波紋式的。顯微鏡下的橫切面，是屬於圓形或近圓形，普通都是黑色。依照解剖學上的研究，波狀髮最近猿猴，直髮次之，羊毛狀髮最高。就人類演化史上觀察，因爲我們體毛的稀少似乎遠居於白種人之上。再根據遺傳定律，黑髮的髮色優越了許多。因之我們的頭髮在世界人類的進化上，的確是處於最高的地位。</p>
<p>膚色　膚色在進化程序上的高下，並不涉及容美的觀點。由抗病力的事實證明，知道黑膚人最强，黃色人次之，白色人種最弱。黃種人對於寒熱兩帶，都容易適應，所以我國人無論僑居何處，都能生活，很少爲了水土不服而發生病患的，這點好處，實在也是黃色皮膚的天賦特長。</p>
<p>脣　脣的厚薄，也是人類進化上的一個車要證據，玫之動物形態學，白種人的脣最薄，似與猿猴較近，黃種人次之，黑種人確最爲「人化」。</p>
<p>顏面角度　由額向鼻尖作直綫，再由鼻向耳作綫，兩綫相交所成的角度，叫做顏面角度。依照演化論的推斷，顏面垂度愈大即面角小，他的智慧程度亦愈低，反之則較高，我國人的顏面角，介於黑白二種人之間，如果智慧與面角大小果眞密切相關，則其天賦智能乃屬於中等，並非低劣。</p>
<p>眼　我國人的眼色通常爲深褐色，並非黑色。開度爲中等，往往有一層叫做『蒙古層』在靠鼻的內角，但其作用未明。眼的形式稍斜，稱爲杏仁眼，就是外角比較內角略高。</p>
<p>鼻　在演化程序上，白種人的鼻形高而且狹，佔有最優的地位。我國人大都爲中鼻，南方人或以氣候關係，闊鼻的形式尤爲顯著，此點我國人似屬較低。</p>
<p>以上所舉各點都是人種分類學上所依據的規準，細察之，知國人體質結構，並不處於低劣地位。就是和世界其他種族相較，更顯出許多優點，而且處處顯示『中等』的事實，在生物進化的立塲上着想，『中等』或許是汰劣留良的結果，有了這種科學的分析，很可以打破我們自相懷疑的觀念。由此可知今日的受人侵陵，決不是基於人種下劣的問題上。當然具有其他複雜的因素在，如社會組織，政治制度，民衆知識，愛國思想，這些都是很重大的要因。</p>
<p>我們用不着自相鄙視，把整個民族堅結爲一體「先知道你自己，然後進行你的工作」這是一句可取的名言。誠然，古老的民族不免流入萎弱之途，但是新的刺激，壓力，蹂躪或許也是更生的最大動力，光榮的未來，將由此開展。</p>
<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>各國元首的娛樂</h3>
<p>— 宋景濂</p>
<p>最近自埃及京城開羅來的消息，埃及十八歲國王法羅準備應飛行員試騐，以期獲得飛行員執照。實在這個消息對認識國王的人一點不覺得希奇，因法羅王身體異常健康·對於各種戶外運動本已極爲愛好。</p>
<p>自一九三叫年比王亞爾培爬山跌斃，及一九三五年比后因汽車失事重傷殞命諸慘劇後；世界各國元首，仍以危險性之運動（如飛機，汽車等）爲其業餘娛樂，正如埃王法羅致力於飛機的駕駛。</p>
<p>可是一國元首的生命關係至爲重大，所以英國下院曾干涉此事過，下院請求國王喬治五世以父執令當時王位承繼者威爾士親王（後來之愛德華八世今之溫莎公爵）勿騎馬過度。喬治五世本身亦極愛好騎馬，每日往海德公園必以馬代步，亦好遊艇，且是掌舵的好手呢。胆子最大的要算前西班牙王亞芬斯十三世，他是騎馬駕汽車的好手，當其在法國波多　遊歷時，曾以駛車過速為路警所截留。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞國王卡羅現僅常與其子以騎馬、溜冰爲戲，在其未登極前，他極好飛行，他是乘飛機趕去重登王位的。</p>
<p>保加利亞王波力喜駕汽車貨車，以高速度在保國崎嶇不平之路上馳騁。他亦好駛火車，且得到保加利亞鐵路技師的執照，並以被舉爲鐵路職工聯合會名譽會長爲榮。</p>
<p>至於瑞典皇帝的娛樂，我想各位都曉得，他是位網球名手。</p>
<p>挪威的輿拉親王喜乘機器脚踏車。</p>
<p>老邁的丹麥國王克利斯登好乘自行車出遊。</p>
<p>希特勒並不愛好戶外運動，至於他的難兄莫索里尼，則恰恰相反，不論飛機、汽車、機器脚踏車、騎馬、游泳、競走……等都有他的份兒，莫氏確是萬能，還會說數國語言呢！</p>
<p>法國總統勒勃　好在蘭勃亦來森林中騎馬散步。</p>
<p>下面數位元首的娛樂和上而幾位截然不同，是在藝術方面的：一九〇八年被暗殺的葡萄牙王加羅一世是個名畫家，曾二次得到法國沙龍畫展與一九〇〇年巴黎博覽會的金獎章</p>
<p>出身英國皇室的羅馬尼亞國太后伊利沙白是個著作等身的作家。歷史上維多利亞女皇善繪畫，尤好描寫鄉村景色，在其行裝中必有一本小畫簿。絕代艷后曼麗安東尼喜將巴黎景色刻描於鈕釦上。象破侖三世的母親善水彩畫與描人像。</p>
<p>現在再講到希特勒，他雖不善運動，却是個畫家。數年前柏林的霍門主筆曾出版了一部水彩畫集，內中有歐戰時一伍長的作品，且署名亞道夫希特勒。</p>

<h3>電影從業員須知　電影術的職司和責任</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>報紙上儘有好的電影批評，但是壞的批評也不是沒有。明明是導演的錯處，他却會歸罪於演員；明是導　的長處然他也會歸功於攝影師的。這裏我把電影藝術的六大職司和責任簡略說明，希望一般觀衆及電影批評家用進一步的目光來檢討一個電影的好壞：</p>
<p>編劇者</p>
<p>他的責任是使一個電影的主題正大，內容充實，切合時代性。他必須避免主題不淸楚，內容架空，平凡，荒誕，無稽，無社會的意義，無藝術的價値等等。</p>
<p>導演者</p>
<p>他要怎樣用電影的手法，將編劇者交下來的劇本具體地搬上銀幕，他要管到整個戲的旋律（Rythem），什麼地方可以輕描淡寫？什麼地方該重要地佈置？怎樣抓住劇的緊要關頭？如伺使觀衆的心情不會鬆懈下來？他還得把全劇中的每個人物的個性明顯地區別出來，不要使一個演員在同一個戲中突然會流露出不同的性格。他應該如伺地發動其他的合作者如音樂師，音響帥，攝影師等來助長他的劇的進展，以及如何控制他的演員不要做出文明戲的味兒來。</p>
<p>演員</p>
<p>他個人是否做得眞，做得好。他應該仔細地研究他所担任的角色。個性，動作，語調，態度，風采，某塲戲應該如何表現，某個塲面應該怎樣地流露他的眞情實感。要是他故得不足或過火，動作態度小够藝中人身分……那麼是他的錯誤。</p>
<p>置影師</p>
<p>他應該佈置創造適宜於劇情的「環境」，塲面的空氣足和不足，他也値得考察的。</p>
<p>攝影師</p>
<p>採光，配光是他的重要使命。每塲戲的光錢，是應該完全統一，强烈塲面，應該用硬綫條約採光，美麗抒情的塲面，應該用柔輕的調子，快樂的塲面應該用明快的調子等等。</p>
<p>收音師</p>
<p>他的責任是在語言，音響的調節上，音的高低强弱，都應該適合劇情的進展。不過機械的粗陋及其他物質條件不足，都不是他的過失。</p>
<p>該報記者在結束他的這一篇通訊時，說了下面的幾句話：「重慶全市市民，其他如成都等幾個中國內部比較大的城市亦然。他們對於高尙音樂現在正似其他生活的條件同樣的渴望着，所以極歡迎各處的歌唱團能够光臨。</p>
<h3>「　惜姣」與張文遠之表情</h3>
<h3>銷麟觀後（下）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>因為在道一齣戲　，澈底揭開貧富」「勢利」「善惡」「因果」「天災」「人禍」一切的面目，尤其是說萬貫家財的富翁，說不定馬上會變成窮人，以及行善得福，知恩圖報這兩點，處今之世，可以說是含有充分的刺激性。</p>
<p>關於穿挿編劇人頗費巧思，不少幽默的對白，眞是針針見血，令人啼笑皆非。在這令人滿意的穿挿中，更有不少新的貢獻，有幾塲完全借車對白，絕對地話劇化，像發大水時不用水神過塲，而幕內衆喊「大水來了」，也是値得贊美的改革。硯秋最近編的幾部戲，確有小少改革而令人一新耳目的地方，這齣戲比較更進步了</p>
<p>講到技術方面，硯秋的做工，素來爲人所欽佩的，尤其是演悲哀一路的戲，這裏前塲的薛湘靈，是一位千金小姐，硯秋照樣有超特的演出，描寫湘靈的嬌生慣養，大有雍容華貴儀態萬方之美，看嫁妝時的水袖，接連有兩個美妙絕倫的姿式。講到，這齣戲可以說讓台下人過足戲癮，最重要的是兩段二六，一段二簧，和一段西皮，第一段二六是春秋亭避雨一塲，這一段二六後轉快板，間有白口第四句「想必是新婚渡鵲橋」「渡鵲橋」三字，有一佳腔，後轉快板，更佳腔百出，尤其是每一段落之末一旬，其收腔無一雷同，良非易易。其唱詞中有七字一句者，有六字一句者，更覺新頴。伴天麟遊嬸一塲，唱二簧慢板，最末唱大段二六加哭頭，共間皆多新腔，因限於篇幅，未便一一舉出。總之，硯秋之腔本不易學，此戲所用之腔，更令人由「聽聽好聽學學難學」之感。至於配角方面，支配上似稍欠妥，芙蓉草應飾趙守貞，張春彥應飾　祿寒，設謂硯秋此戲尙係初决演唱，為將來演唱便利起見，而派吳富琴飾趙守貞，則梅香一角，相當重要，何不派曹二庚，而派劉斌崑，演出成績，以劉斌崑之梅香為最佳，斌崑飾丑丫頭，以不常見，演此劇之梅杳，恰到好處。與硯秋同塲，極盡襯托之美，而斌崑能不以大嗓門怪勁兒逗台下人一笑。而完全在演技上及小動作方面取勝，値得叫好。芙蓉草顧　蓀之戲不多，無用武之地，曹二庚之丑丫頭，李小龍之胡傑，均極發噱，吳富琴之趙守貞，張春彥之薛良均稱職，孫甫亭李四廣慈少泉平平而已。此戲演員頗多，黃全班底幾至全部出動，以演出之成績論，這齣戲還値得一看。</p>
<h3>歌唱團重慶表演記</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>在上月份美國波士　某報，載有一段重慶通訊，內容所述是關於最近有一團中西耶徒聯合組成的詩班歌隊在當地演出時的情形；現把原文摘譯於下：</p>
<p>該團的領導者爲一加拿大人，名叫加當安紐；團員共有五十八人，內包括有外國傳敎士及成都五大學的學生。在重慶共演出了三次，地點是借國泰大戲院舉行，每次演出院中總無隙地，擁擠之狀，正是不可思議。至於唱出之歌曲，其性質可分二種；一種與抗戰簡直絕無關係，另一種是絕對可以影響及於抗戰的；屬於前者的為「多瑙河之夜」等名曲，後者的有黃君所編的「抵抗歌」“Song　of　Resisteuce”等，此外，又唱出了一支佛敎讚美歌；耶徒組成的詩班歌隊內唱佛敎讚美歌，眞是世間的奇事了。該團在演出收入中，認定了七千元捐給中國的戰時孤兒。</p>
<p>說到該團除在舞臺上演出了三次外的活動；爲接受當地各方的歡迎會；父播音了數次。財長孔祥熙常該團在剛到重慶時，特為之設宴洗塵。</p>
<h3>美容捷徑</h3>
<p>— 印</p>
<p>有一次，派拉蒙公司當局向美貌的女演員提出一個問題：「你以為什麼方法可以使容貌美麗？」答案中，有十二人說充分睡眠是最好的方法，三個人介紹幾種美容品：一個說多運動，少吃點心，一個說要多飲開水；還有一個說多沐浴；皆可使容貌美麗。</p>

<h3>The Beijing-Zhongxiang Road Has Been Cut Off; Zhongxiang and Yangzi Are Heavily Besieged by the Japanese; Control of Traffic on the Xiangyang-Huarong Road Has Been Assumed by Chinese Troops; Chinese Troops in Southern Henan Recapture Xishuanghe and Fiercely Attack Xinyang</h3>
<p>Shashi: Japanese troops who raided northward from Zhongxiang and Yangzi were divided into separate forces. One force was severely attacked by the Chinese army near Changshou Town, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese reinforced their attack, retreating to Shahe Town (northwest of Changshou Town) and Majiaji (north of Changshou Town), where they were again ambushed by the Chinese army from both sides, resulting in a disastrous retreat. The Chinese army is currently in pursuit. Another force retreated from Zhongxiang to the vicinity of Fengle River and was ambushed by the Chinese army. After a day and night of bloody fighting, countless enemies were annihilated. Combat continues. Another force retreated from Dongqiao north, once capturing Zhangjiaji. On the morning of the fifth, a powerful Chinese unit launched a fierce attack from the side, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, and Zhangjiaji was immediately recaptured. The unit has now advanced to the rear of the Beijing-Zhongxiang Road, completely cutting off the road. Another Chinese unit has been pursuing the Japanese army for several days with great success. On the second, near Yangjiaji, southeast of Jiukou, the unit successively defeated the Japanese troops who had raided from Tianjia Yuan, Linjiaji, and Jiukou strongholds, killing over five hundred Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army is expanding its victories while advancing north across the Hanyi Road, reaching the southern side of the eastern section of the Beijing-Zhongxiang Road by the night of the fourth, joining forces with the Chinese troops moving south, achieving the goal of cutting off the Japanese army's rear. The Japanese troops in Zhongxiang and Yangzi are now heavily besieged by the Chinese army. (Sixth dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang: Chinese troops in southern Henan have been annihilating the Japanese army in separate routes according to a prearranged plan, with many casualties. The Japanese army that invaded westward from Zhugou (west of Queshan) was ambushed by Chinese forces at every turn, suffering numerous casualties. On the fourth, the Japanese force attacking near Xiaolin Town (east of Tongbai) increased to over ten thousand. The Chinese army, utilizing the mountainous terrain, intercepted and killed the Japanese, causing great chaos. The battle lasted until the fifth, with over two thousand Japanese soldiers annihilated. The large Chinese army that advanced behind the Japanese has recaptured the Xishuanghe stronghold (west of Xinyang), establishing contact with the Chinese armies east and west of the Pinghan Railway. The Chinese army continued to advance fiercely towards Xinyang, again cutting off the Japanese army's retreat route. (Sixth dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: On the night of the third, a total of tens of thousands of Japanese troops raided near Suixian, dividing into separate routes to invade Leigong Mountain (northeast of Suixian), Gaocheng (north of Sui and belonging to Shan (northwest of Sui)), and residential areas, as well as Chunchendian (west of Jun and Sui). The Chinese army inflicted heavy casualties on them at every turn. At the same time, a powerful surprise force acting according to a prearranged plan reached Lihua Road on the sixth, controlling the Japanese army's rear traffic. The force is in close contact with certain Chinese units pre-positioned along the Xianghua Road, actively developing the rear. (Sixth dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The two thousand or so Japanese troops near Zhugou, west of Queshan, retreated westward to Biyang County City on the night of the third after being heavily attacked by the Chinese army. The Chinese army is currently pursuing and annihilating them. (Fifth dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The situation in southern Henan is becoming more stable. On the third, over six thousand Japanese troops invaded westward from Maoji, northeast of Biyang), encountering the Chinese army near Huanggang, triggering a fierce battle. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the outer flanks of the Japanese army. Fighting continued until the evening, with countless Japanese soldiers killed. On the morning of the fourth, the Chinese army again used a portion of its forces to penetrate deep into the Japanese rear, ambushing and killing many Japanese. The Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed in retreat. The Chinese army is closely pursuing and annihilating them and is using its main force to completely encircle the Japanese along the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, a Chinese military commander took the lead and attacked Shigunghe (east of Biyang), posing a great threat to the Japanese. The military's morale has been boosted. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to Wangdian Fort (west of Minggang). Currently, the Chinese and Japanese forces are still engaged in bloody battles in the Xiaolin Town, Guxian, Maoji, and Huanggang areas. (Fifth dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The war on the Xianghua Road in northern Hubei has been extremely fierce for the past two days. On the morning of the fifth, a mixed Japanese force of four to five thousand troops, under the cover of forty to fifty tanks, launched an offensive against the Chinese army. The Chinese army met the attack, and a fierce battle ensued throughout the day. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The forces are currently facing each other northeast of Lishan (northwest of Suixian). A fierce battle is taking place on the left flank between Chunchendian and Anju (both west of Suixian). The right flank was ambushed by the Chinese army in the mountains northeast of Gaocheng. The momentum of the Japanese forces has been greatly reduced. (Fifth dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here, the Japanese army that invaded the Xiangfan area of northern Hubei has four routes. The two northern routes are invading westward from several points on the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan. The two southern routes are invading Xiangfan from Suixian and Zhongxiang in northern Hubei. One route of the Japanese army in southern Henan is invading Qinyang from the Pinghan Railway, apparently intending to invade Tanghe, Nanchang, and Xinye (all northeast of Xiangfan). Another route, departing from Xinyang, is attacking Tongbai. The purpose of these two routes is clearly to protect the right flank of the Japanese army. Another route of the Japanese army is invading Fancheng westward from Suixian along the Xianghua Road. The fourth route of the Japanese army, departing from Zhongxiang, is currently engaged in battle with the Chinese army in the area north of Changshou Town. According to reports, the Japanese army previously attempted to invade Xiangfan a year ago. Their right flank, between Zhaoyang and Tongbai, was counterattacked by the Chinese army, resulting in a general retreat and confinement to the Pinghan Railway area. Furthermore, the Chinese army north of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei, downstream from Hankou, attacked Qichun, Tianjia Town, and Wuxue on the fourth at dawn, aiming to assist the Chinese army in the northwest of Hankou.

<h3>Readjustment of the Administrative Regions of Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Leiyang: The current administrative supervisory regions in Hunan Province are not properly divided, with significant differences in area and population. The organization and funding are exactly the same, which is not sufficient to meet the needs. In order to increase administrative efficiency and adapt to the wartime environment, the authorities are adjusting the regions based on area, population, terrain, and administrative convenience, and adding a new region to achieve flexible command. The commissioner's office and the regional security command will be combined, and expenses will be reduced compared to the past. (Fifth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southwestern Shanxi Report Another Victory; Jishan and Fencheng Are Breached; Another Unit Recaptures Xihouma; Over Two Thousand Japanese Soldiers Invading Jincheng Are Killed</h3>
<p>Lingbao: Chinese troops in southwestern Shanxi are actively advancing against the rear of the Japanese army, with great success. At dawn on the second, after annihilating a portion of the Japanese army near Sanguanyu (northwest of Fencheng), they took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Fencheng. Their morale was high, and they repeatedly charged and killed, with countless casualties. By the morning of the third, the remaining Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and retreated into the city in disarray. A unit of the Chinese army closely followed the retreating Japanese troops and immediately breached the south gate of Fencheng, triggering street fighting. (Sixth dispatch)</p>
<p>Xi'an: Since the Chinese troops in southwestern Shanxi began operations against key points on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, progress has been extremely rapid. At dawn on the second, the victorious Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on Houma. After a day of bloody fighting, a portion of the remaining Japanese troops were almost wiped out. The Chinese troops successfully recaptured Xihouma and are currently besieging Donghouma. (Sixth dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: Since the Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi raided the area in the middle of last month, the Chinese army has been destroying them one by one, with over half of the Japanese casualties. On the third, over four thousand remaining Japanese troops raided the southwestern area of Jincheng and were intercepted by the Chinese army and encircled near Xiyu and Dalingkou, inflicting heavy casualties.

<p>Xiushui: After Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi recaptured Jing'an and Fengxin, they continued to fiercely attack Anyi from the third. The Japanese army in the city was terrified. A portion of them retreated to Wanjiabu on the evening of the fourth. Besides sending a strong force to pursue the retreating Japanese troops, the Chinese army also adopted an encirclement strategy against Anyi City. By noon on the fifth, the highlands southwest of the city had all fallen into Chinese hands, and Anyi City was completely under Chinese control. (Sixth dispatch)</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi Advocates Economic Resistance</h3>
<p>Guilin: General Bai Chongxi delivered a speech at today's commemoration ceremony, stating that the effectiveness of the Sino-Japanese War depends more on the economic front than the military front. The current Japanese military strategy is clearly aimed at shortening its lines of defense, consolidating its defensive power at key points, and avoiding expanding its theater of operations, while striving to develop transportation. Bai Chongxi also pointed out the Japanese attempt to build a railway between Qinzhou and Nanning. Bai Chongxi continued, stating that the Japanese are now using pro-Japanese Chinese to develop their economic exploitation in China and to destroy Chinese legal tender. Therefore, the Chinese people should also launch a counteroffensive from the economic front. (Sixth United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Italy and the European War</h3>
<p>Civilized people unanimously hope that the European war will not be prolonged or expanded, but trends indicate that the hope of non-prolongation is gone, and the hope of non-expansion is nearly gone.</p>
<p>As far as the current situation is concerned, the possible direction of expansion is in the Mediterranean, and the critical juncture for expansion is in Italy. The Pope fervently prayed yesterday: "May God protect Italy from the scourge of war." It is said that he was tearful when praying. The Pope's prayer evokes great sympathy in anyone and makes anyone more deeply aware that Italy is about to participate in the war. We do not know how God will rule? We do not know how Prime Minister Mussolini, who rules Italy, will decide!</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Mr. Ansaldo, the manager of the newspaper "Electrical News" and an organ of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, broadcasted a speech to the Italian army, saying that "Italy should prepare for war to break out within one or two weeks." This newspaper then speculated that "it can be regarded as the victory or defeat of the Nordic war situation will be decided within one or two weeks." Indeed, we observed Italy's attitude, which must take the victory or defeat of the Nordic war situation as a turning point. Now, the Allied forces of Britain and France have unfortunately been defeated in Northern Europe. As a result, the Mediterranean Sea is turbulent, and Italy is preparing for war. In recent days, Italy has both announced an additional military expenditure of 800 million lira and declared that 800,000 Italian troops are standing by and 340 Italian ships are ready to take action when the war extends to the Mediterranean. All these gestures can be seen as Italy is about to take action, at least in response to Britain and France's increased defense in Alexandria. It can also be seen that this wanting to but not acting is Italy's way of coercing Britain and France. Originally, Italy called itself a "have-not" country, so it has always been full of complaints about the "have" countries of Britain and France. It hopes to take the opportunity to extort them in order to satisfy its economic interests and territorial desires. It was in tune with Germany before the war, and it maintains its close relationship during the war. The difference is that Germany uses force to achieve its goals, while Italy waits for Germany's victory to achieve its goals from it. Gaida, the spokesperson of the Italian Fascist Party, once pointed out that Italy's needs are nothing more than two: one is the need for free and abundant space for the development of the Italian people, so that they can work peacefully within the territory of Italy, and the other is the need for the Italian nation to live and act freely, and there should be a system that eliminates all foreign control. The former refers to the interests on both sides of the Mediterranean, and the latter refers to the rights of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. In the superficial attitude, it shows that Italy has the power to fight for these two needs. It has repeatedly said that it is ready to participate in the war, which is the meaning of this. In other words, it also means that if Britain and France can satisfy what it needs, then Italy can live by peaceful work from now on, that is, it will not participate in the war. But what about Britain and France?</p>
<p>Britain and France's current move of their fleet to the Mediterranean cannot be regarded as Britain and France's response to Italy's demands, nor can it be regarded as Britain and France's threat to Italy. Originally, France under Daladier followed Britain's Chamberlain in everything, and compromise with Italy was Chamberlain's consistent policy. It was first seen in the recognition of the Italian Empire, and then in the compromise in the Spanish incident. Recent news from The Hague also said that Britain is seeking contact with Italy in order to obtain understanding, and it is willing to consider Italy's position in the Mediterranean and the shipping in the Suez Canal. However, Britain and France do not have the best credibility with Italy, so the concern expressed by Britain cannot win Italy's trust. Moreover, the so-called concern cannot be interpreted as giving Italy satisfaction. And US President Roosevelt's efforts for peace and his expression of unwillingness to expand the war to the Mediterranean can of course make Mussolini think more, but in terms of weight, it is not enough to prompt Mussolini to change his mind!</p>
<p>According to British and French propaganda, Germany has recently strengthened its pressure on Italy, making Italy more inclined to Germany. This kind of statement is either a lie or an irrelevant statement. Italy will never accept oppression in the middle of this European war, and the great powers will not support the oppressed in their time of need. The most likely attitude is to add flowers to the brocade and participate in the work of oppression! If the British and French had the absolute advantage in the Nordic war situation a few days ago, we firmly believe that the Mediterranean would still be calm. Unfortunately, the Nordic war situation is not as small as Britain and France wished, and fortunately Britain and France have not completely lost in Northern Europe, but only suffered a setback, so whether the war will expand to the Mediterranean is still left with some room for hesitation. What is worrying is that the facts do not allow for such hesitation to last long. As for how it will develop and how it will tend, I don't want to discuss it too much, but that Britain and France will have to make more difficult sacrifices can be asserted in the middle of this European war.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese War Will Form a War of Attrition; American Newspaper Says Chinese Military Strength Is Great; The Current Situation Seems To Be the Prelude to a Major War</h3>
<p>New York: The New York National Voice Forum newspaper recently published an editorial saying that the Sino-Japanese War will form a war of attrition. The newspaper said that although the war may be prolonged and endless, the current situation seems to be the prelude to a major war that will soon occur. China now has a strong and powerful army. This army is sufficient to be self-sufficient and has a large number of small arms. However, because the Chinese army cannot obtain the heavy weapons necessary for large-scale warfare, its operations are often hampered. It seems that both sides in the war want to wage a war of attrition, hoping that the other side will lose its fighting power. China hopes that the Japanese army will divert its attention to all aspects, while Japan hopes that the people will return to the "Nanjing government" and that the National Government in Chongqing will disintegrate. However, the newspaper also said that according to Foreign Minister Arita's speech on Saturday, Japan seems to have felt that the achievements of the "Nanjing government" are very slim. In that case, the Japanese army will continue to fight, and its victory is still far away. (Sixth United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Situation Is Turbulent and Unstable; Resource Mobilization Plan Is Difficult to Draft</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The draft of this year's resource mobilization plan was approved by the Planning Agency on the first of this month and will be submitted to the Cabinet meeting for discussion. According to news published in the local newspapers, it is very difficult to draft a full-year plan due to the turbulent domestic and international economic situation. Therefore, this draft is limited to the first quarter of this fiscal year, that is, from April to June of this year. According to last year's plan, rice was the main crop, but this year, in addition to rice, it also includes important necessities, such as firewood and sugar. In addition, the price determination committee is currently studying restrictions on purchases and may also include fresh fish and vegetables.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Silver Problem Has Not Yet Been Resolved; Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Talks</h3>
<p>(Fifth Havas Dispatch) When a reporter asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo today about a report that Japanese Foreign Minister Koya Masayuki and British Ambassador Craig had met on Saturday and Sunday and had completely compromised on the Tianjin silver problem, the spokesman replied that there had been some progress, but that he could not say for sure when the problem would be resolved, because some minor issues had not yet been resolved. When asked if the Japanese government would take any action on the continued decline of Chinese legal tender, the spokesman replied that the depreciation of legal tender was a very serious problem, but that the Japanese government was not considering any action, but that he had heard that bankers in Shanghai and Hong Kong had held talks to take joint action.

<h3>Japanese Merchants Raise Large Sums to Operate Tobacco in China</h3>
<p>Small-Scale Textile Companies Will Also Be Moved to the Fallen Areas of China</p>
<p>Tokyo: Three well-known Japanese tobacco companies have decided to organize a trust to operate tobacco business in China. The capital is set at 127 million Japanese yen. According to reports, the value of tobacco produced by each company annually is 300 million Japanese yen. The annual output of British and American tobacco companies competing with Japan on the Asian continent is 400 million Japanese yen. (Fifth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan Cotton Textile Industry Association plans to move the smaller textile companies under its jurisdiction to the fallen areas of China. The Japanese military authorities in Central China have already given their support. The Asahi Shimbun reported that due to the shortage of cotton, the output of cotton textiles of Japanese textile companies in Tianjin has decreased by 60%, and the output of Japanese companies in Qingdao has also decreased by 50%. However, because the selling price of cotton textiles is higher, the business of each company can still maintain a good state. (Fifth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Ministry Holds Meeting to Discuss Warship Issues</h3>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Admits That Difficulties Are Overwhelming; Reprimands the Foolish Excesses of Frivolous Elements; Striving to Adjust Relations with the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Arita spoke at the Japan International Association, discussing Japan's neutral position in the European war and the foolish excesses of frivolous elements. He said that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the political phenomena in our relations with third countries were roughly the same as after the September 18th Incident. At that time, some Japanese advocated occupying China, and now we have occupied Manchuria. After Stimson made his statement, these people, out of momentary anger, sang the high-pitched tune of punishing the United States. Today, we hear this again. This kind of foolish excess cannot be allowed to spread for even a moment. It is important to know that Japan's foreign policy at that time was focused on resolving the Soviet-Japanese dispute and adjusting Japan's relations with Britain and the United States. The spread of the Sino-Japanese War caused friction between Japan and second countries. As a result, the voices of chaos filled the ears again. First, it was to start a war with the Soviet Union, and then it was to punish Britain and the United States. This kind of reckless suggestion cannot be part of foreign policy at all. When Japan is promoting its policy at home, it must adjust relations with other great powers. The Soviet Union is currently implementing a program of production expansion, so it advocates peace abroad, knowing that it is disadvantageous to engage in war until its strength is strong. We also hold the same attitude and intend to adjust relations with the Soviet Union. What is especially important is the relationship with the United States. Although the American people's feelings towards Japan are very bad, we must not anger them. As for Japan's neutrality when it is at war with its neighboring countries, it has no experience, so the people lack the training of neutrality. For this reason, when incidents like the Asama Maru occur, there is an uproar. In the current European war, the belligerent countries will inevitably infringe on the rights of neutral countries. Japan finds it difficult to preserve the rights of its neutral countries. At this time, the people must understand the true nature of the overall situation and calmly deal with all the difficulties.

<h3>Amidst Tense Mediterranean Situation, The Pope Tries Hard To Stop Italy From Joining The War. The Pope Met With The Italian Crown Prince Yesterday To Discuss The General Situation. The British Ambassador To Italy Has Departed To Return To His Post. Balkan Governments Have Exchanged Opinions For Days.</h3>
<p>Vatican. The Italian Crown Prince and his Princess saw the Pope today, and they talked for thirty-five minutes.

<p>London. British Ambassador to Italy Sir Roland is scheduled to return to Rome today to resume diplomatic talks. Diplomatic sources here recently stated that the recent attacks on Britain and France by Italian newspapers have intensified, so the mission of Ambassador Roland's trip is very difficult. It is reported that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Counselor Charles of the British Embassy in Italy a few days ago and expressed surprise at the preventive measures taken by Britain in the Mediterranean, and said that Italy's attitude remained the same, and Britain did not need to take these measures. Later, Britain and France took other preventive measures, especially sending a fleet to Alexandria, Egypt. The Italian diplomatic authorities re-submitted their inquiries to Britain, asking for the truth, but Britain and France decided not to change their policies before the tone of Italian newspapers and the so-called "people's" demonstrations were improved. Observers believe that Italy's actions are two-pronged: on the one hand, providing guarantees to appease people's hearts, and on the other hand, adding threats to the negotiating countries. For this reason, although the government has provided guarantees to Yugoslavia that it will not infringe on its territory, the Yugoslav government and Britain and France still expressed doubts. In short, although the current crisis is not imminent, it is necessary to take the maximum preventive measures. Even if this crisis cannot be eliminated in one fell swoop, it can at least delay its onset. In addition, the general public is satisfied with Turkey's adherence to the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, believing that Turkey is worthy of being the mainstay of Southeast Europe.

After the last World War, Bulgaria was forced to sign the Treaty of Neuilly, losing a lot of territory, while neighboring countries expanded a lot of land. In contrast, Bulgaria repeatedly complained, using the slogan of restoring lost territory. Britain knows this, so British Ambassador to Turkey Knatchbull-Hugessen informed the Bulgarian government of Britain's suggestions and stated that the Turkish government is also prepared to assist Bulgaria.

<h3>British Public Opinion Demands Improvement of Government Institutions. There Will Be a Great Debate in the House of Commons Today.</h3>
<p>London. The attention of the local newspapers is still focused on the future debate in Parliament on the Norwegian war. Some commentators believe that before the government has the opportunity to explain its handling and answer many complex questions, it should not draw conclusions for the time being. The Times expresses its deep admiration for Prime Minister Chamberlain's energy and courage, but said that in terms of personnel, certain improvements should be made. In the wartime cabinet, greater concentration and driving force are needed, and more time is needed for forward-looking thinking. The newspaper also said that the concept that the wartime cabinet is completely separated from the views of various officials is no longer supported by most people. The most important figures in the cabinet should each have their own representatives, such as the recent example of the chiefs of staff of the three services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) each having a representative. These representatives can slightly reduce the pressure on the work of some cabinet members. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters reporter stationed in the Parliament lounge claimed that no one is prepared to predict what will happen in tomorrow's House of Commons debate. The situation of the debate depends on the content of Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech and its impact on the entire House. It is expected that the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will all speak. The natural way would be for either Army Secretary Stanley or Air Secretary Hoare to end the debate on Tuesday, and for Navy Secretary Churchill to end the debate on Wednesday. However, if a severe attack is triggered tomorrow, Churchill may come forward to intervene on the first day. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London. The "Daily Mail" here recently published in a prominent position a letter from a certain anonymous but well-known member of the House of Commons. The letter also lists a hypothetical list of cabinet members. The list includes Lloyd George, who served as Prime Minister during the previous European War, and all major positions are given to Labor Party members. The list has Halifax as Prime Minister, Churchill, Lloyd George, and Eden as ministers without portfolio, Morrison as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Attlee as Foreign Secretary, Sinclair as Navy Secretary, Hudson as Air Secretary, Moore-Brabazon as Army Secretary, and Woolton as Minister of Economic Warfare. Well-informed sources believe that at the time of the British army's withdrawal from Norway, it is extremely important for the prestigious Lloyd George to take the stage. Even the conservative newspaper "The Times," which usually criticizes the Labor Party, also believes that this kind of important government reorganization plan that can consolidate the entire foundation of the government and represent the entire strength of the country has already become the general public's psychology in the past few days.

<h3>United States Closely Watching British Political Situation, Fearing Japan Will Take the Opportunity to Invade the Dutch East Indies</h3>

According to the opinions of political commentators, recent developments have caused genuine anxiety among important officials in Washington.

<p>New York. The New York Tribune published an article saying that the democratic countries can get some comfort from the situation caused by the Allied defeat in Norway, that is, this move has deeply shaken the hearts of the British people. Those who made them encounter this were the experienced and prudent heads of state. Whether they will allow these people to leave the government can be seen in a few days. However, they at least know now that what they are doing is a real war, and all wars cannot be won by waiting quietly. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction in Canada over British War Actions</p>
<p>New York. The New York Times carried a report from Ottawa, saying that some of Canada's dissatisfaction with the British government's war actions is now becoming more and more obvious. The report also said that here it is believed that the failure of the British army in Norway, for the two places of Wye Andalsnes and Namsos, the dissatisfaction has increased. Many people feel that this not only shows Britain's failure, but also reflects Canada's own war efforts. Many non-official Canadians are too worried and uneasy about Britain's failure, so they complain. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Distribution of Food in Britain</h3>
<p>London. Food Minister Lord Woolton announced today that, in view of the suspension of supplies from Denmark, the public must prepare for the possibility that the per capita ration of butter will soon be reduced to the previous amount. If he cannot be completely sure of the sufficient supply of sugar in the second half of this year, the per capita ration will also be reduced. He intends that the convenience of cold storage may not be enough to cope with the worst possible situation that may come. We have started the construction of cold storage warehouses in eight places far apart in the country. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anglo-French-Norwegian Allied Forces Encircle Narvik, German Planes Aid in Northern Norway with Over a Hundred Sorties, British Admiralty Announces Destroyer Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin: Today's German military communique stated that the enemy has transported more artillery pieces from the north, but there were no major military operations in the Narvik area yesterday. German military aircraft were active near Narvik, dropping a heavy bomb that hit an enemy warship, and also bombed enemy camps and ammunition depots. One ammunition depot was hit and exploded. German troops advanced northward from Grong, south-southeast of Namsos. Central and southern Norway are now quiet. The fortress built on Mount Hegra has been captured by German forces. Two British airships were attacked and damaged by German military aircraft near the northern coast of Norway. A British submarine was captured by German forces in the Kattegat Strait. The captain of the submarine was arrested. It was found that the submarine was severely damaged by a mine. Subsequently, a German patrol boat towed it into the harbor. In the area of Terschelling, German forces shot down two British Bristol Blenheim military aircraft. There were no particularly important events on the Western Front. (Reuter telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters military correspondent stated that the Allied forces are now carrying out a well-planned offensive against Narvik. Before carrying out the bombardment, the Allied forces warned civilians. Although this is tantamount to notifying the German forces of the Allied forces' intentions, after the evacuation of the residents in the city is completed, the Allied naval commander will have a wider scope of operations. The German forces have built a continuous series of concrete machine-gun nests, which must be cleared one by one, so the progress is quite slow. The outskirts are not suitable for armored vehicles. German bombers will not be able to gain an advantage. The situation is similar to Trondheim, because the Allied anti-aircraft guns are already in place, and the German air bases are relatively far away. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: German forces are now trying to gain air superiority in the Narvik area. It is reported that no fewer than one hundred German planes flew north in one day. News of isolated resistance in central Norway continues to arrive. However, the only organized Norwegian army is said to be the division commanded by General Fleischer in the Narvik area, totaling 25,000 men. Except for a portion of 2,000 men who have been transferred to the Trondheim area to fight, the rest are said to be intact. It is reported that the Norwegian army has entered the Gratangen Valley and eliminated 1,000 German soldiers. According to news from Oslo, German forces have captured 10,000 Norwegians and are said to be using them for agricultural and industrial work in Norway. London estimates that the German forces besieged in Narvik number between 3,000 and 4,000. According to official sources, military operations in that area are still ongoing, but the adverse weather makes it difficult to predict a swift result. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The War Office recently released a communique stating, "The war in the Narvik port area in northern Norway is still ongoing. There has been no major development except for some activity by the enemy air force." (Havas telegram, 5th)</p>

According to news from Sweden, Norwegian troops have repelled 3,000 German soldiers in the Rofotnas area. The town of Aas is still burning after being bombed by German planes.

<p>Stockholm: According to reliable sources, one hundred German planes flew to Narvik port in northern Norway this morning. It is generally believed that the German forces intend to launch a surprise offensive on the front line of the port, but it is widely held that the Norwegian 7th Division has been stationed near the port for a long time, and its strength has always been intact. At the same time, the number of Anglo-French Allied forces stationed near the port is also very large, so it is unlikely that the German offensive will be advantageous. (Havas telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: It is reported that fierce fighting took place around Narvik yesterday. The Allied land, sea, and air forces bombarded German positions in heavy snow. According to the Norwegian Telegraph Agency, a German giant bomber flew to Kirkenes on Saturday and Sunday and dropped bombs, but there was little damage on the ground and no casualties. People here believe that the plane's purpose was to scout the Kirkenes area to see if there were any Allied forces from Namsos and Åndalsnes. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to reports in local newspapers, about 300 German soldiers occupied Snåsa, about 50 kilometers northeast of Steinkjer, this morning. The German troops were well-equipped and moved quickly, occupying all public institutions within a few hours. Norwegian soldiers and civilians did not resist. It is said that the German troops seized military supplies and hundreds of vehicles abandoned by the Allied forces. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German military experts and a correspondent from the Haitong News Agency discussed the current situation of the war in Norway this afternoon.

The Norwegian Telegraph Agency stated that after the Allied forces withdrew from the south, the Norwegian army received orders to retreat to the north. Initially, they were quite disappointed, but they were later excited when they heard the official announcement that fighting would continue in the north. The Norwegian military headquarters is now located in the north. The Norwegian mobilization is still ongoing. The Norwegian positions south of Røros have not changed after the ceasefire order. In a recent battle, 120 Norwegian soldiers defeated three days of German troops. The German side suffered 35 casualties, while the Norwegian side only suffered 5 casualties. From now on, the Norwegian troops in southern Norway will only engage in guerrilla warfare. The Norwegian troops in the rugged Glomma River valley are determined to resist. The German forces have repeatedly tried to capture their land but have not succeeded. German forces southeast of Støren suffered losses and retreated, abandoning hundreds of corpses.

It is said that after the Allied forces withdrew from Namsos, British warships and the destroyer HMS Afridi (Captain Vian) were among those escorting the retreat to protect against enemy aircraft and submarine attacks. At dawn, enemy aircraft launched successive attacks in batches, but the anti-aircraft fire from the escorting ships was very effective. The ships transporting troops suffered no damage. HMS Afridi was hit by a bomb at that time and soon sank. All crew members have been notified. At that time, a total of two enemy planes were shot down. It is noted that Captain Vian was awarded a medal in April for rescuing 299 British sailors imprisoned on the German ship Altmark. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Foreign Minister Secretly Arrives in London to Confer with British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>London: Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht and Defense Minister Ljungberg arrived here yesterday to discuss everything with the British government. They presumably departed from Norway on a British warship and landed at a port in Scotland. This trip was very secretive, and people only learned about it a few hours after they arrived in London. After arriving in London, they went to the Norwegian embassy to confer with Minister Colban for several hours. It is reported that they will meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax and other important figures on Monday together with the British Minister to Norway, Sir Cecil Dormer. Koht gave a broadcast last night, saying that he was staying in London for a few days to discuss how Norway could get help to resist the violent army. He will go from London to Paris within days and then return to the country to fight. Koht also said that Norway's neutrality was indeed impartial. If Norway accepts Germany's demands, it will be reduced to a German dependency. After the events in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, Norway no longer trusts Germany's new promises. Germany has failed morally to the extreme, and no one believes its words anymore. Norway today reiterates the declaration of 1814, that the Norwegian people do not want to be slaves. Germany's attack on Norway was pre-arranged. Koht also mentioned that Britain and France aided Poland and sent 4,000 troops, saying that the Western countries have made a promise to liberate Norway. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Renowned British Reporter Observes German and Italian Strategy: Italy to Invade the South, Germany Prepares a General Offensive</h3>
<p>London: Renowned reporter Price recently published an article in the Daily Mail, stating that although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will not declare war on Britain and France to aid Germany, he will seize considerable territory in the Mediterranean when the time is ripe. If the outcome of the war is a victory for Germany, Italy will permanently occupy this territory. If Britain and France win, it will be used as a basis for bargaining during the peace conference. It is generally believed that Italy wants to seize the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia. The leader of the Croatian opposition, Ante Pavelić, has been living in exile in Italy since King Alexander of Yugoslavia was assassinated in Marseille. Although the French authorities have requested extradition, Mussolini has always refused and may use him if necessary in the future. A senior Italian official said last month that the country would take action within 60 days. The date may be the 24th of this month, the 25th anniversary of the country's participation in the previous European war. In that country, people generally say that Hitler's concern is that the war will be prolonged until this winter and that US President Roosevelt will be re-elected in November of this year, so he hopes to launch a general offensive on the Western Front this summer. However, it is not impossible for Hitler to use a feint to the east and a swift attack on the Balkan Peninsula. In addition, Mussolini is now planning to borrow submarines and air bases from Spain.

This declaration has had a major impact on the British side. We do not know whether he made this statement for propaganda purposes or as his loyal confession. However, we believe that what he said is sincere, and we are happy to see this matter. In short, attack England. The sharpness of the British enemy's tactics is enough to make Napoleon's dream come true." (United Press telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Husband's Energy Declines, Wife's Interest Wanes</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Medical Graduate of Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Among the five human relationships, the mother-child relationship is innate, while the husband-wife relationship is the most emotional. However, although there are many loving couples, there are also many unhappy couples. The reason for the disharmony between husband and wife is due to the husband's declining energy, resulting from masturbation in early years and excessive indulgence after marriage. These youths often experience impotence, premature ejaculation, and frequent nocturnal emissions after marriage, and the sexual experience lacks joy and satisfaction. The wife's interest wanes, and it is difficult to have a harmonious love life. The treatment lies in increasing sperm and nourishing the blood, abstaining from masturbation, strictly prohibiting excessive indulgence, and then taking "Buti Kang," a German testicular essence tonic for men, to completely cure the problem. "Buti Kang" was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Mehlen. Its ingredients are entirely derived from the testicles of apes and are mixed with brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-nourishing calcium, and made using scientific methods. After hundreds of clinical experiments by Chinese and Western doctors, its effectiveness has been proven to be accurate, and it has been released to the public. Therefore, its treatment of nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, stunted development, back pain, etc., is many times higher than similar preparations on the market. The female "Buti Kang" is derived from the endocrine of the ovaries of apes and animals, with the function of regulating menstruation and promoting conception, treating anemia and premature ejaculation, stunted development, and infertility after marriage, with miraculous effects. Couples who feel physically weak after marriage and suffer from the above symptoms will experience rejuvenating effects after taking "Buti Kang." However, those with nocturnal emissions should also take Ners Nocturnal Emission Pills.</p>
<h3>British and French Labor Party Leaders Discuss Cooperation</h3>

In the future, when democratic countries win and restore peace, there must be a strong international system that can ensure the independence and rights of the peoples of all countries and can enable all countries to disarm in unison to guarantee peace. Among the French representatives were former De Brouckère, and among the British representatives were Attlee, Greenwood, and Morrison. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

It is also generally believed among members of Congress that although the United States government has no intention of retaliation, the Mexican government's decision is sufficient to cause adverse effects and only benefits the Townsend bill.

<h3>American Educator Arrives in Shanghai, Speaks of China's Resistance to the End, The Stage of Japanese Negotiations Has Passed, Morale in the Interior is High and Belief is Firm</h3>
<p>According to reports, a certain internationally renowned American educator recently arrived in Shanghai after touring various provinces in western China. He stated that the stage for Japan to negotiate peace with China has now passed. Chairman Chiang has formulated a plan to promote China's heavy industry, which within three years will enable China to independently produce all military equipment needed for the war of resistance. "The people within Free China are all optimistic and confident, and fully support the government's war policy." This educator has met with dozens of important figures including Chairman Chiang, H.H. Kung, T.V. Soong, Neng Yun, Dr. Jing Hwai-lin, Deputy Minister of Propaganda Dong Xian-guang, and leaders of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Resist to the End, No Compromise</p>
<p>When interviewing Chairman Chiang, he inquired about the possibility of China manufacturing its own airplanes and cannons. Chairman Chiang replied that the Chinese government will implement this plan according to a set procedure. Furthermore, according to senior officials, Japan had asked a confidant of Chairman Chiang to convey a message, attempting to contact Chairman Chiang for negotiations. Chairman Chiang ignored the Japanese proposal. The Japanese attempt has failed. Government officials frankly admit that China has suffered significant losses as a result of the war. However, there is currently a common view among the Chinese government and the public, which can be summarized as "No compromise with the enemy, resolutely carry out resistance to the end, to seek national rejuvenation."</p>
<p>Economic Institutions Becoming More Stable. Government officials admit that China's final victory depends on four key elements: (1) money, (2) military supplies, (3) manpower, and (4) automobile transportation. The most serious of these is the issue of money, which encompasses the entire national economic organization. However, officials firmly believe that the economic situation in "Free China" can be readjusted through control measures. The large-scale relocation of factories and people to southwestern China has caused drastic changes in social institutions, presenting the government with many difficulties. However, the situation is now gradually improving, and given time, economic and social order can be restored, and the overall situation will become more stable.</p>
<p>Training Elite Troops Facilitates Transportation. There is absolutely no problem with manpower. There are currently four million well-trained soldiers, and new recruits are being trained every month. Regarding the issue of automobile transportation, there are large fleets of trucks in the north, but most drivers lack sufficient mechanical knowledge, resulting in negligence. Under the effective management of Minister of Communications Chang Chia-ao, the number of trucks has increased sharply. Chang stated that the main problem lies in training a large number of truck drivers with mechanical knowledge, who know how to repair and properly maintain the vehicles to prevent unnecessary waste. Regarding this point, Chang has ordered the establishment of repair workshops along important highways.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang is the Supreme Leader</p>
<p>The American educator went on to say that regarding the political situation in "Free China," rumors of friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be refuted. According to reports, such rumors are often heard by Chinese people outside "Free China," but they are completely unfounded. He had frank discussions with responsible leaders of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and knew that no one understood their common mission of defeating and driving out the enemy better than them. They are cooperating sincerely and striving together in various ways to accomplish this mission. Chairman Chiang has rapidly risen to the position of supreme leader of the country. He believes that Chairman Chiang, due to his position in the government, has placed himself above party or factional views, and has become the "cement" that unites the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>National Morale and Military Morale are Equally High</p>
<p>It is heard that the number of military supplies provided by the Soviet Union to China is very large, but the official information on the exact amount is not available. In his opinion, as the war continues, military medical care will become a serious problem. Private hospitals and independent medical teams have done their best to remedy the alarming situation caused by the shortage of medicines. The Red Cross is now formulating a plan to provide effective medical services at the lowest cost. What is more important than all the wartime activities in "Free China" is that everyone has the spirit of enduring hardship and seeking a bright future. National morale and military morale are equally high, because they embrace belief and optimism and do not hesitate to sacrifice. There is absolutely no talk of peace in "Free China" today. Everyone is united, carrying out the war as completely as possible. The war may last for several years, but he firmly believes that the Chinese government and people, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, will not end the war of resistance until China has completely gained independence and freedom.</p>
<h3>Today, All Circles Commemorate the May Seventh National Humiliation</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the May Seventh National Humiliation. Various circles in the Japanese city do not plan to have any ceremonies to express their feelings, but only to mentally encourage themselves, commemorate this painful day, and focus on practice, working hard in their respective positions.</p>
<h3>Run on Deposits Subsides, Financial Stability Increases, Foreign Exchange Stabilizes after Support, Ministry of Finance Plans Measures to Crack Down on Speculation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 6th. A leading Chinese banking figure told a Reuters reporter today that although the authorities withdrew support for the legal tender foreign exchange control in the Shanghai exchange market on Thursday, there is no reason to doubt the legal tender. This doubt comes from the activities of speculators, whose irresponsible actions will be condemned by the world. The Chinese authorities intend to continue to support the legal tender, and the recent withdrawal of support is only temporary. The existing silver reserves available to the stabilization fund have increased slightly, so the authorities are confident that they can handle the exchange situation.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese government declared its determination to maintain the monetary system and stabilize foreign exchange, and the bankers' and money changers' guilds truthfully denied restricting withdrawals, the market stabilized slightly yesterday, and people's hearts gradually calmed down. However, rumors have not completely subsided. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically interviewed the secretary of the Bankers' Association and a member of the Money Changers' Association yesterday. According to them, the member banks and firms have been preparing everything since rumors spread in the market that withdrawals would be restricted again. Although the current environment is difficult, fortunately the strength of the banking and money changing industries is sufficient, so they can cope with it easily. The rumor that the banking and money changing industries held an emergency meeting on Sunday is false. It is hoped that all circles will not easily believe rumors, so as not to fall into the conspiracy of villains.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Capital Still Needs to Be Dispersed</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with a leader in the banking industry yesterday. According to him, the order and safety of the Shanghai concessions can be maintained to a considerable extent, so refugees from all over the country regard Shanghai as a haven of peace during the war. For two and a half years, more and more people have gathered, and the capital has increased accordingly, so the capital in Shanghai is becoming more and more abundant. Although the theory of transferring capital to the southwest has been very popular in recent years, although many in the banking and money changing industries have implemented it, large-scale transfer may not be achievable in one step, so how to coordinate and take care of dispersing Shanghai's capital and make it run on the right track still requires further efforts. The financial community should set an example, so that finance can gradually get on the right track, so as not to fail the government's expectations.</p>
<p>The Financial Community Should Set an Example. He also said that Shanghai's economic prosperity is contrary to the wartime national policy. The financial community did not examine it carefully, but only took its own superficial interests as a prerequisite, and provided as much assistance as possible, or used other convenient methods, to promote the abnormal development of the economy in the occupied areas. As a result, it violated the proper strategy of the wartime national policy, and some in the financial community even bought and sold foreign exchange and gold, hoarding daily necessities, in order to make profits. This kind of situation is a violation of government prohibitions, so it is hoped that the financial community should remember the government's difficulty in supporting wartime finance and the century-old plan of national life, and have a sense of their due responsibility, and promptly stop engaging in improper business, so as not to encourage speculation and affect people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Loosens, Gold Still Rises</p>
<p>Previously, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market, causing the market exchange rate to shrink sharply, and speculators rushed in. Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced its listed prices: British exchange was three pence one two five longer one two five, and US exchange was four yuan five jiao, longer one eight seven five. Legitimate needs of various industries have been supplied. At the same time, the market believes that the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has come out to maintain it, so the actual transaction market is higher than the HSBC listing price. However, the gold market rose against foreign exchange due to speculators' collection. The morning closing price was six thousand nine hundred and sixty-five yuan, and the afternoon closing price was seven thousand and ten yuan. The legal foreign exchange listing price of the Central Bank remains the same, without any change.</p>
<p>Withdrawals Subside, Finance Tends to Stabilize</p>
<p>Yesterday (Monday), after the banks and firms opened at 9:00 a.m., general depositors did not withdraw much money from the banks and firms because they confirmed that the rumors of restricting withdrawals were unreliable. At the same time, the financial market has stabilized due to the maintenance of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and the interbank lending of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank, and Bank of Communications, as well as the adjustment of the bankers' and money changers' guilds. It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the Shanghai black market foreign exchange and has jointly planned remedies with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Those who speculate in foreign exchange and hoard daily necessities will be investigated and punished, and illegal trading in the gold black market will be strictly cracked down on in order to relieve people's difficulties and maintain security.</p>
<p>The Court is Ordered to Strictly Crack Down. It was also learned yesterday that since the drastic changes in the black market foreign exchange last week, the courts of the First Special Zone and the Second Special Zone of this port have received instructions from Chongqing, ordering them to strictly crack down on speculation, manipulation, and hoarding. Those who have obtained solid evidence may be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or at least five years of imprisonment by the court.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices, Drastic Reduction in Purchasing Power, The Apparent Prosperity of the Commercial Market is Exhausted</h3>
<p>Shanghai's price threat is serious, and the apparent prosperity of the commercial market is increasingly exposed. According to a leader in the cloth industry yesterday, Shanghai's prices have reached an unprecedented peak, and people's livelihood is extremely difficult. The commercial market of various industries has also been deeply affected. Now, except for daily necessities such as rice, coal, and flour, which can be saved, the rest lack purchasing power. Taking cloth as an example, it is also a kind of daily necessity, but the selling price of cotton yarn has repeatedly risen sharply. Ordinary cloth has risen to the price of silk in the past. Citizens cannot afford three meals a day, so how can they have the surplus to add clothes? Therefore, the turnover of various industries has decreased significantly. The same is true for other department stores. If this continues, the commercial market will be depressed, and factories will reduce work, which is a major hidden worry for the future of industry and commerce. At this time when the authorities are about to implement additional donations, it is hoped that the municipal authorities will stand up and seek ways to save the situation, cultivate tax sources, and maintain the market.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Authorities. According to reliable sources, the authorities of the two concessions will take considerable measures to curb the speculation and manipulation of merchants due to the soaring prices in recent days. The plans are (1) to establish a food production and marketing cooperative to handle production and sales, (2) to issue notices to inform citizens. According to the authorities of the French Concession Police Department, from April 15 to May 1, 23 out of 80 stores were found to be in violation of regulations and were fined 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Use of Law. Currently, the authorities of the French Concession are making every effort to place the market under their jurisdiction, so that citizens from all walks of life pay close attention to it, because the prices in the market are often lower than those in the stores, so if citizens can pay attention to this and criticize it closely, prices may fall accordingly. According to Mr. Ge Bo, Assistant Secretary of the Public Works Department, the restrictions on prices by the authorities of the two concessions in the past can be said to have failed, so it is believed that it is necessary to use the law. This means that it is necessary to legislate to restrict prices, if the black exchange continues to tighten.</p>
<p>Food Problem</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions are now paying the most attention to food and flour. According to investigations, there are still 780,000 bags of rice in stock in this city, which is enough to supply the citizens of this city for six months. The highest rice price set last winter was 40 yuan, but now the rice price has soared to 54 yuan. The Price Stabilization Committee of the Public Concession and the French Concession of this port has scheduled a joint meeting this week to discuss this matter. The rice industry believes that the main reasons for the failure of rice price limits in the past were the scarcity of sources and the restrictions imposed by the Japanese in the suburbs of Shanghai, so it is hoped that the establishment of a production and marketing cooperation mechanism can enable both parties to the transaction in this port to gather together and trade at the lowest prices under the supervision of the authorities of the concessions. However, this matter is still in the preparatory stage.</p>
<p>Selling Coal Balls at a Reduced Price</p>
<p>Since the black exchange in this city fluctuated a few days ago, coal ball merchants took the opportunity to raise market prices, and each load rose to nearly 10 yuan, which generally threatened civilians. Guohua and Dongfang Coal Ball Factories have now decided to hold a sale of coal balls at a reduced price from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. every day, with the price set at 8 yuan and 5 jiao per load (100 city catties). However, for the sake of popularity, each household is limited to one load. The method is to pay for the goods first, and then pick them up the next day. There are no cartage fees, but telephone orders will not be accepted. The locations of the two factories' sales are listed below.</p>
<p>Guohua Factory Sales: 6 locations, 394 Route Tenant de la Tour, 625 Connaught Road, 195 Avenue du Roi Albert, 111 West Gate Road, 819 Sinza Road, 269 Seymour Road.</p>
<p>Dongfang Factory Sales: 10 locations, Dongfang Coal Ball Factory Branch, 29 Langbing Road, and 203 Muirhead Road, and Yuanyuan Coal Ball Company Service Station, 155 Route Tenant de la Tour, 114 Maichiqi Road, 13 Annan Road, 467 Avenue Road, 117 Jessfield Road, 151 Rue Bourgeat, 199 Chihli Road, Edward Avenue Edward Market.</p>
<p>The Coal and Firewood Association of this city is experiencing difficulties in its business due to the high wholesale price of coal balls, which is as high as 170 yuan. In order to maintain the business of the industry, it has held a district registration to investigate the actual situation of various industries, so as to request improvement of the business from the large coal companies. It is heard that the French Concession is divided into three districts, and the Public Concession is divided into four districts. Once the registration work is completed, a meeting will be convened to discuss various improvement issues.</p>
<h3>Tea Exports Surge, Benefiting the National Treasury</h3>
<p>At Times, the National Treasury Benefits.</p>
<p>Tea is a special product of China, and the annual exports are always in the tens of millions of yuan. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the National Government vigorously promoted special products and encouraged exports, with great success. In the first quarter of this year, the national tea exports totaled 164,270 quintals, with a value of 43,569,392 yuan. In terms of value, it is several times higher than the same period last year. Green tea accounts for the majority. Although important cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been occupied, the vast tea-producing areas in the interior are still guarded by the National Army, so tea production has not been greatly affected. According to Ningbo Customs statistics, tea exports in March alone reached 48,000 quintals, with a value of 16 million yuan. From January to March, the total was 95,028 quintals, with a value of 30,138,895 yuan, accounting for three-quarters of the total national tea exports. They are all purchased by the government's trade agencies and transported to Hong Kong for resale to Europe, America, and the Soviet Union. Exports through customs such as Shanghai in the occupied areas are less than a quarter of the total, so the government's wartime finances are improving.</p>
<h3>Under the Shadow of High Prices, Strive to Relieve the Poor, Various Charitable Groups Continue to Operate, Wealthy Merchants and Giants Should Donate and Assist</h3>
<p>The Pi Han Suo (Shelter from the Cold) at Yan's Residence on Difeng Road in this city was established by the Joint Disaster Relief Association of charitable organizations last winter after borrowing vacant land from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Department. Since it began to take in poor people on the street on February 1 of this year, it has greatly benefited them. As of the end of April, it has taken in a total of 876 people. Now that the weather is turning warm, it was originally intended to end the operation, but in view of the fact that these people are the poorest citizens, once they are disbanded, they will still be reduced to the streets, which is closely related to social security. It has now been decided to abandon the name Pi Han Suo and reorganize it into a Vagrant Reformatory, hoping to give them time to reform them, provide education, and teach them production technology, so that they can become something in the future. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry and Pharmaceutical Industry Association held a sale of plain rice at the Gion Dharma Assembly. Now that many poor people are buying it, it has increased to 7,000 catties per day. The plain rice sale at Moore Church and the porridge distribution at the Buddhist Association are also still ongoing. Since high prices make it difficult to stop the work of relieving the poor.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rotary Club Celebrates Mother's Day</h3>
<p>The president of the club is Qian Xing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club will celebrate Mother's Day at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday (the 9th) at the Cathay Hotel. At that time, Mr. R. Buck, conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Band, will be invited as a guest of honor. Mr. William H. Hastspan will also give a speech entitled "Mother's Day and Its Views." Several women have also been invited to participate. It is also heard that in addition to celebrating Mother's Day, the association will also hold a farewell party for the outgoing president Wang Fu and former president Hagenson. The association has now issued a notice urging all members to register the names of those they have invited.</p>
<h3>After the Increase in Public Bus Fares, Income Has Increased Compared to Before</h3>
<p>The British Public Bus Company issued 35,000 yuan in substitute tokens and 160,000 yuan in substitute coins due to the lack of subsidiary currency in this city. Now that the panic of subsidiary currency has been resolved, the substitute currency has been gradually recovered. Two-thirds of the paper tokens have been recovered, and it is expected that it will not be difficult to recover them all within this month. As for the substitute coins, because they are easy to carry, they are mostly stored by passengers, so the recovery is still small. Since the bus fare increased in the middle of last month, the number of passengers has decreased by a quarter every day compared to the past, but due to the increase in price, although the number of passengers has decreased, the daily income has increased by more than 6,000 yuan, because in the past, the daily fare was about 220,000 yuan, but recently it has increased to more than 260,000 yuan. Regarding the resumption of driving in the northern district, the company authorities said that it is still impossible at present.</p>
<h3>North China Mailing Parcels, Japanese and Puppet Also Implement Control</h3>
<p>Dazhong News Agency said that since the North China Organization implemented foreign exchange settlement for exports last year, all luggage parcels and goods under 100 yuan are exempt from foreign exchange settlement. Recently, the control has been tightened, and the value of personal parcels sent from North China to Central China and South China must be approved by the "Joint Reserve Bank" before they can be transshipped.</p>
<h3>After the New Exchange Transfer is Strengthened, There is No Need to Issue Exchange Transfer Certificates, and it is Feared that After the Issuance, the Public Will Hoard Them, so it Has Become a Prepared but Unused Item</h3>
<p>Since the Bankers' and Money Changers' Guild implemented the new exchange transfer in July 28, strengthening the exchange transfer payment reserve, its preparation has been sufficient and has won the trust of various industries, and some foreign banks that refused to accept exchange transfers after August 13 have accepted them because of this. At that time, the banking and money changing industries had considered issuing exchange transfer certificates by the Bank United Preparation Committee in order to facilitate the daily acceptance of merchants due to the time limit of the bills. In addition to the fact that each firm could use the exchange transfer within its original limit, the Preparation Committee could pay the money of the drawer with the most connected industry exchange transfer bill with exchange transfer certificates. However, (1) since the industry preparation has been strengthened, it is expected that the exchange transfer certificate will be popular. If the general public trusts the exchange transfer certificate as much as they trust the legal tender, and they hoard them, the property deposited by various firms will be likely to be shelved, (2) at the beginning of the preparation of the exchange transfer certificate, rumors of circulating banknotes occurred on the market. Although the truth was clarified and the rumors stopped, it was appropriate to be cautious on the day when people were uneasy, so the exchange transfer certificate has not been used yet. Therefore, there is no need to issue it in the future.</p>

<h3>Western Countries Work Together with China, Japan's Reaction to Closing the Door to China, Ahlers Criticizes Japan's Plundering Policy</h3>
<p>English Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that English Greater Shanghai Evening Post financial editor Ahlers, with the support of the Chongqing Diplomatic Association, recently wrote a book entitled "Japan Closes the Open Door to China," published by Kelly &amp; Walsh. The book details Japan's economic occupation in the occupied areas of China and Japan's plundering and exclusion of third countries, which are not allowed to engage in normal trade in China.</p>
<p>Presenting Definite Evidence</p>
<p>The first chapter of the book discusses "Why the West Should Care about China's Economy." The main idea is that after the end of the European War, China's great economic importance has attracted worldwide attention. Considering China's potential, China's past and current economic status is not enough. From 1937 to 1939, the foreign trade in western and southwestern China was extremely prosperous. If the Japanese had not imposed air raids and naval blockades, China's foreign trade volume would have been even larger. The second chapter discusses "The Meaning of the Open Door," saying that this kind of meaning is clear, practical and to the point.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese are determined to expand in China, and the economic system, policies, and objectives implemented in the occupied areas are the same everywhere, gradually excluding Westerners and oppressing the Chinese. The "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" that the Japanese have been promoting for a long time is by no means mutually beneficial, but is entirely a one-sided "cooperation." It is only a pretext for the Japanese to plunder China's national and private property, in fact, forcing the Chinese to use their property to help the Japanese profit.</p>
<p>The remaining chapters of the book discuss China's shipping, railways, commerce, and trade, etc. One section states that Western countries are in the same boat, and even extreme friendly countries such as Germany and Italy have gained very little profit from their friendship with Japan.</p>
<h3>Fierce Gunfire in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Audible Last Night, Shaking Windows</p>
<p>English Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that foreign residents in the Hongqiao district claimed today (6th) that they heard fierce gunfire near Hongqiao district early this morning, and the windows shook. It is probably that a striking team is active in the area again. The gunfire started at 2:00 a.m. and stopped half an hour later.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Hongkou Formulate Punishment Rules</h3>
<p>Illegitimate Profits Will Be Handled Appropriately</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese Consul General, Garrison, and Naval Special Marine Corps agreed on several punishment rules for Japanese residents at the Japanese Club on Pong Road last Saturday. Anyone who commits one of the following will be punished according to law: (1) Renting a house and subletting it to others in order to seek illegitimate profits, (2) Drinking excessively and making noise everywhere, (3) Suddenly acquiring illegitimate property in a short period of time, (4) Secretly selling opium, (5) Transporting various drugs to other ports.</p>
<h3>Six American Ships to Sail the Far East</h3>
<p>The Shanghai American Foreign Trade Shipping Company, a subsidiary of the United States Westward Shipping Company, officially announced yesterday that, starting from August 1939, the company has purchased ships from the United States Maritime Commission for voyages through the Strait of Georgia and the Far East. Six of these ships have been assigned specific schedules. Their routes will traverse the Pacific Ocean, traveling to and from the Far East. The names of the six ships are "Cape Cleare," "Cape Fairweather," "Cape Corinth," "Cape Meares," "Cape Sebastian," and "Cape Seppings." The ships' routes will start from the Strait of Georgia, passing through Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. It is also learned that the first of the company's ships to arrive in Shanghai will be the "Cape Corinth," scheduled to sail from the Strait of Georgia on the 10th of this month. The company also hopes to increase the number of ships in the near future.</p>
<h3>Carrying Gold and Silver to Shanghai Often Confiscated</h3>
<p>It's Best to Transfer it to the Mainland, Don't Transport it to Shanghai to Support the Japanese</p>
<p>According to the Dazhong News Agency, when people carry gold and silver from the interior to Shanghai, they are often confiscated by the Japanese military along the way. On the 5th, a Mr. Zhou arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou by train. He claimed that Japanese military police in the train car inspected passengers for concealed gold and silver, checking everything from felt hats and collars to waistbands, sewn pockets, inner linings, socks, and shoe soles. Anything found was confiscated. It goes without saying that luggage, baskets, and crates were also routinely searched. Last month, a friend from northern Jiangsu Province who came to Shanghai also witnessed the strict search for gold and silver at the ports. If found, all would be confiscated, and any argument could lead to unexpected danger. The letter also included a few words: "Given the soaring gold prices and the Japanese facing financial difficulties, it is hoped that those who have gold and silver will find a way to transfer it to the interior and hand it over to the national bank for purchase. Do not violate national laws (as private transportation of gold and silver is prohibited by the government) by privately transporting it to Shanghai to support the Japanese, allowing them to exchange it for foreign currency to purchase military supplies to kill our people."</p>
<h3>Foreign Warships Gather in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Nine American and British Ships, Six Japanese Ships</p>
<p>Recently, warships from various countries have gathered in the Huangpu River, their flags flying, creating a colorful scene. According to inquiries by the Datong News Agency reporter, the current ships berthed in the Huangpu River include five American ships: USS Augusta, USS Isabel, USS Luzon, USS Panay; four British ships: HMS Cricket, HMS Mantis, etc.; two French ships: La Grandière, Jarnac, etc.; two Italian ships: Lepanto, Carlotto, etc.; and six Japanese ships, including the transport ship Tokyo Maru and the repair ship Asahi. Among them, the American flagship USS Augusta, the largest, is particularly noticeable, anchored in the middle of the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Japanese Small Aircraft Carrier Moves to Mitsubishi Wharf</h3>
<p>A Japanese naval small aircraft carrier arrived in Shanghai at approximately 2:00 PM on the 1st of this month, berthing at buoys 11 and 12 on the Yangshupu River. At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, it suddenly left the buoys and sailed south, arriving at the Mitsubishi Wharf (i.e., the Toyo Company Wharf) north of the Hongkou Waibaidu Bridge and north of the Japanese Consulate at approximately 11:00 AM, where it docked.</p>
<h3>British Ships Traveling Between Europe and Asia Detour Around the Cape of Good Hope - The Mediterranean Situation Creates an Invisible Tension to Prevent Changes to the Suez Canal Navigation</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European war and Italy's expression of its intentions, the Mediterranean situation has suddenly become tense. In addition to taking precautionary measures in the Mediterranean region, the British authorities have also instructed British ships that previously passed through the Suez Canal to detour around the Cape of Good Hope and enter the Indian Ocean. It has been learned that, although relations between Britain and Italy are unlikely to completely break down, all British ships sailing between Europe and Asia are now following the aforementioned instructions to prevent danger. The British ship "Shantung," which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Scandinavia on the 13th of this month, will also detour around the Cape of Good Hope to sail to Shanghai.</p>
<p>French and Italian Ship Routes Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>France and Britain are allies, and tensions between Britain and Italy are bound to cause tensions between France and Italy. However, according to reliable sources, French ships sailing between Europe and Asia have not yet received detour orders from their home country, claiming that they have "taken certain measures" to adapt to changes in the situation at any time. It is also said that a French ship will depart from Shanghai via the Mediterranean Sea and return to its home country on the 8th of this month. As for Italian ships, they are still operating as usual, with no changes. The Conte Rosso mail ship, which is coming to China from Europe this time, has already passed Singapore and is in Hong Kong. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around Thursday (the 9th) of this week and will return to Genoa from Shanghai on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Female Boss of a Guiding Agency Kidnapped - A Dispute Over Recruiting Female Guides Leads to Kidnapping as Revenge - Now Held on Yuyuan Road</h3>
<p>The Yong'an Guiding Agency is located in the rear厢房 on the upper floor of No. 11 Jingqingfang, Guangxi Road. It employs more than 20 female guides internally and is a small guiding agency. It was opened by Gu Xiujin, a middle-aged woman from Pudong (commonly called "Big Sister Gu," 39 years old), and has been in operation for more than half a year. Wang Yiqiu and Ni Adi are also employed as accountants and perform their respective duties. At around 12:30 PM yesterday, Gu Xiujin and Ni Adi were suddenly kidnapped, forced into a car, and sped off towards western Shanghai. They are now being held at a certain location on Yuyuan Road. Details of the situation have been learned and recorded below.</p>
<p>Sudden Appearance of Strange Men</p>
<p>At approximately 12:30 PM yesterday, while Gu and the accountant Ni Adi and the tea boy Zhang Maosheng (19 years old), etc., were having lunch at the agency, three strange men suddenly broke into the room. They immediately drew handguns and forbade anyone from making a sound. They then took out handcuffs and handcuffed Gu Xiujin and Ni Adi, both male and female, forcing them to go downstairs, walk out to the road at the entrance of the alley, and forced them into a waiting car with license plate number 17906, which turned south into North Sea Road and drove straight west. Afterwards, the agency reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and inquire about the kidnapping.</p>
<p>No Payment Given</p>
<p>On the day before yesterday (the 4th), at approximately 7:00 PM, the agency received a phone call from a Mr. Wang in Room 4 of the Dahonglai Restaurant on Four Horses Road, requesting two female guides to serve drinks. The agency sent Wang Yaqing and Zhao Yuexian to respond to the request. After the drinking became less lively, they accompanied the guests to Room 404 of the Dadong Hotel at 9:00 PM, staying for about an hour, and then went to the Xindu Theater on Yu Qiaqing Road to watch a play. Soon after, they went together to Room 618 of the Jielu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. A plan to indulge in lust was unsuccessful, causing dissatisfaction from the two guests. At dawn the next morning, at approximately 5:00 AM, they called the two female guides back to the agency, but they did not give them any payment. At that time, the time was calculated, Zhao Yuexian for eleven hours and Wang Yaqing for ten hours, and the cost of services should have been 21 yuan.</p>
<p>Outburst of Roaring</p>
<p>Wang and Zhao, the two women, suffered this blow, so they used the telephone to report to the agency. The agency owner Gu Xiujin, along with the accountant Ni Adi and Wang Yiqiu, rushed to reason with them. Unexpectedly, the two guests had already called seven or eight people from other places. When Gu and the others arrived, they quickly closed the three doors of the room and slapped Ni Adi several times. Fortunately, Wang Yiqiu was alert and took the opportunity to escape, calling two street patrol officers from 1803 and 1756. The two parties were brought to the police station. After a preliminary hearing by the police chief, it was ordered that 21 yuan be paid on the spot, and they were reprimanded before they left. At 2:00 PM, after a certain colleague came out to mediate, the other party insisted that Yong'an pay 30 yuan to settle the matter. As a result, because the conditions were harsh and difficult to comply with, unexpectedly at 6:00 or 7:00 PM, they gathered 40 or 50 hooligans to cause trouble, making a scene. Fortunately, no major incident occurred.</p>
<p>Negotiations with the Police Station</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, yesterday at noon, three strange men suddenly came. Two of them held handguns, and one held a box cannon. They broke into the agency and handcuffed Gu Xiujin and Ni Adi, both male and female, forcing them into a car and sped off towards western Shanghai. Afterwards, it was learned that the car with license plate number 17906 belonged to the Xiangxing Automobile Company. The driver, named Yin Guoliang, was a local, 34 years old, and his driver number was 340. He has already reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station. He said that at approximately 12:10 PM, three customers came to the Xiangsheng Company branch near Zhaofeng Garden at the end of Yuyuan Road. The accountant ordered him to drive. When they reached the entrance of Jingqingfang on Guangxi Road, he was instructed to stop the car. The three men then walked into the alley. Before long, a man and a woman were escorted into the car and forced him to drive to western Shanghai. They are now being held at a certain location on 　　Road. The police have been notified and have ordered a Japanese police officer to go and negotiate and demand extradition. It is said that the other party has not yet agreed.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed at the Cosmopolitan Dance Hall - Xie Ziting Shot Dead - Shot and Killed Leaving the Dance Hall and Entering a Car at 11:00 PM Last Night</h3>
<p>An assassination occurred at the entrance of the Cosmopolitan Garden Dance Hall on Gordon Road at approximately 10:55 PM last night. The victim was Xie Ziting, a local, over 50 years old. He was shot four times and died instantly. The perpetrators were two men who escaped without a trace. Details of the situation have been learned and are provided below.</p>
<p>Brief History of the Deceased</p>
<p>Xie Ziting, a local, whose style name was Qingmo, was formerly the manager of the Zhongfu Bank. He used to reside in Gouyu Lane in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, and had a good reputation. Later, he moved to Fan Garden on Haig Road. He once held an important position in the former municipal government and currently works for the fake consolidated tax bureau. He moved to a certain residence on Dunxin Road on Great Western Road. At approximately 10:00 PM last night, Xie took a black-plated car with license plate number 9107 to the Cosmopolitan Dance Hall on Gordon Road and danced with the dance hall's star, Chen Mingming.</p>
<p>Murdered After Dancing</p>
<p>At approximately 10:55 PM, when the dancing became less lively, he walked out of the establishment and hired a silver car (license plate number 18270) to return to his residence. When the car arrived in front of the gate, just as he was stepping into the car, unexpectedly, two perpetrators suddenly emerged from Maibian Road nearby, one wearing a Paisley suit and the other a black long gown, and rushed to the side of the car. The man in the suit forcibly dragged Xie out of the car, turned his body around, and fired four shots in a row, all of which hit their mark: one shot in the right arm, one in the left armpit, one in the back, and one in the back of the neck. Xie fell to the ground in response and died on the spot. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled without a trace. Afterwards, the dance hall reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and transported the body to Baolong Hospital. The police station is currently investigating the cause of the shooting.</p>
<p>Eccentric Personality</p>
<p>When the reporter rushed to the scene of the incident to investigate, he saw bloodstains all over the entrance, which was chilling. It is reported that Xie went to the dance hall to dance every night at 9:00 or 10:00 PM and had an inextricable bond with the dance hall star Chen Mingming, which has lasted for more than four months. Every day, he signed a "bill," the English writing of which was "C.D.H.ia." At the end of the month, he would go to the dance hall's accounting room to settle the accounts himself. Chen Mingming later told people that Xie came here every night, and when asked about his family history, he looked sad and unhappy, and changed the subject. Moreover, he had an eccentric personality and was taciturn. General speculation is that his sudden shooting may be related to politics. When Xie was killed, he was wearing a light blue striped suit, a black silk handkerchief with white flowers, and yellow leather shoes. His hair was combed back, and he looked like a dignified upper-class figure. Although he was over 50 years old, he looked like a middle-aged man.</p>
<h3>Father-in-Law Accuses Son-in-Law of Embezzling Wood Planks - Defendant Released on Bail and Rearrested</h3>
<p>Hong Xinghua, the owner of Hong Shenji Timber Company at No. 　, Anrenli, Shanhai Pass Road, is a local, 25 years old. Several years ago, through a matchmaker, he married the daughter of Zhang Jusheng, the manager of Yongtai Shenji Timber Company at No. 208, Luban Road, French Concession, who is from Wuxing. Recently, Zhang Jusheng suddenly hired lawyer Qian and accused his son-in-law Hong Xinghua to the Xinzha Police Station of embezzling fir planks worth 15,000 yuan. Yesterday, Chinese detective Sun Guihua and Western detective Litt arrested Hong and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin briefly described the case, saying that the plaintiff and defendant were related as father-in-law and son-in-law. In February of this year, the plaintiff entrusted the defendant to handle 400 pieces of pine planks and 500 pieces of fir planks in Fuzhou, totaling 8,200 yuan. The money has been paid and receipts are held. Later, the plaintiff only received 400 pieces of pine planks, and the remaining 500 pieces of fir planks, worth 15,000 yuan at the current market price, were not received. The plaintiff later found out that the fir planks had been transported to Shanghai and pledged by the defendant to Ye Chuansheng. This batch of goods is still in the customs broker's office. Therefore, he is prosecuting based on Article 336, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant hired lawyers Wang Yaoting and Wu Zhiping to appear in court, arguing that the case was entirely a civil matter and that the plaintiff was acting out of spite to make the defendant subject to criminal punishment because the defendant had recently had a dispute with his wife in order to protect her mother. In March of this year, the defendant was entrusted by the plaintiff to handle one-inch and four-and-a-half-inch pine planks and box planks, and received 16,000 ocean dollars in Shanghai and another 7,000 yuan in Fuzhou. The goods have been prepared and are being loaded. Unexpectedly, because of a dispute between the defendant and his wife, the plaintiff automatically instructed Fuzhou to stop loading the goods and reported it to the police station. The goods that have arrived in Shanghai are another batch of seven-point fir planks, which were ordered by Yichengchang Timber Company. Now, Yichengchang Timber Company has also hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to appear in court, which can prove this. Furthermore, the defendant was arrested once on April 30. At that time, the plaintiff forced the defendant to write a note. The defendant had no way to resist and had to obey. However, after being released, the defendant, out of anger, entrusted lawyer Wu Zhiping to publish a statement in the newspaper denying the validity of the note, stating that the two notes were not from the defendant's true intentions. As a result, the plaintiff reported the case to the police station again, and the defendant was detained for the second time. Now, he is requesting permission to post bail. The judge announced that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was mostly inconsistent. The defendant was ordered to post bail of 15,000 yuan, and the hearing was rescheduled for the 15th.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Road Robbery - Origin of Handgun Ascertained - It Was a Chinese Constable in the French Concession Who Was Robbed - Investigation Underway to Determine if There Were Other Crimes</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, at the west end of Ningbo Road and Henan Road on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, three armed bandits robbed Sheng Yinghua, an employee of Tianjin Hongji Cotton Cloth Company, of 4,000 yuan that he had just withdrawn from the bank, and shot and killed Sheng and Wang Shousen, the clerk of the Money Trade Association. The detectives arrived after hearing the alert. In desperation, one bandit abandoned his gun at No. 178 Tianjin Road, but broke into Lihua Silk Cloth Shop at No. 166, rushed to the bedroom on the second floor, changed clothes, and attempted to escape. He was captured on the spot by a Western detective, and the handgun was also seized. The Firearms Section of the Police Department has verified that the gun is a .32 caliber and was the gun that was robbed from a Chinese constable in the French Concession at the intersection of Avenue des Soeurs and Route Cardinal Mercier on the night of April 17. The Verification Section of the Public Concession Police Department is currently investigating whether the gun was used by bandits to commit other crimes between April 17 and the 4th of this month. The captured bandit is named Zhang Yaorong (transliteration), from Huzhou, 21 years old, and is said to reside at No. 1106 Huanlong Road. He is believed to be one of the three bandits who robbed the gun on April 17. The bandit is currently being treated at the police hospital because he was slightly injured in the lower part of his body by a shot fired by the deceased clerk during the robbery on the 4th of this month. As for the 4,000 yuan that was robbed, the police have recovered 1,375 yuan and are currently tracking down the other two bandits.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Abuses Authority - Relying on Strength to Ferociously Assault and Injure Someone - Official Orders to Request the Police Department to Investigate and Handle the Case</h3>
<p>Mao Yunlong, the owner of Fuan Automobile Company at No. 60 Route Remi, French Concession, is 37 years old this year. Recently, he entrusted lawyer Tao Ran to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Chinese constable No. 1072 of the French Concession Police Station of abusing his authority and using an iron-core wooden stick to assault him, causing severe injuries, and requesting that the case be summoned for investigation and prosecution according to law, and reserving the right to file a civil suit for compensation. According to the complaint, at 10:00 PM on April 12, when Lou Zhigen, a truck driver, was adding oil to a truck in front of the company's door, the defendant, Chinese constable No. 1072, saw this and took the opportunity to pick a quarrel. The driver was having dinner, and the plaintiff heard the sound and came downstairs to explain in good faith that the truck could be driven away once the oil was added. Unexpectedly, the defendant became uncontrollably angry and struck the plaintiff on the head with the iron-core wooden stick he was carrying, causing a 　 hole and blood to gush out, and he fainted on the ground. The family telegraphed the Route Tenant de la Tour Police Station, which transferred him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The defendant used illegal and brutal actions to harm the victim's body. In addition to submitting a report to the Procuratorate of the Court on the 13th, he is filing a self-accusation according to law, requesting an investigation. The medical expenses incurred are considerable, and it is also worrying whether he will become disabled in the future. The plaintiff requests to reserve the right to file a civil lawsuit for medical expenses and other damages for the time being. After receiving the complaint, the court issued a summons for a hearing by Judge Huang Yan yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear. Only the plaintiff and his attorney were present to present the case. After verifying the evidence in court, the judge announced that the defendant had not arrived, the case was suspended, and the plaintiff was ordered to request the Police Department to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read the news about the housing dispute in Baoqingfang, Qipu Road, in today's newspaper, stating that it is my property. After checking, the property is not owned by me.

Sincerely, Feng Zuozhou, May 6.</p>

<h3>Financial News - Foreign Exchange and Hong Kong Dollars Supplied - HSBC's Listed Prices Rise - Chinese Merchants Also Come to Resell</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw HSBC's listed prices rising across the board. The exchange rate for British pounds was changed to three pence and one-eighth, and the exchange rate for U.S. dollars was changed to four and a half yuan. As for the domestic market situation, it was neither tight nor loose, and seemed to be entering a stable state. This was because the Hong Kong Telegraph's opening prices of three pence and fifteen sixty-two five per shilling and four yuan and fifty-six sixty-two five per U.S. dollar were maintained as much as possible, making it difficult for speculators to use their skills. Many of them sold into the market, causing the market to become quite rigid for a time. At one point, the hardest British pound was three pence and three seventy-five, and the U.S. dollar reached four yuan and eight seventy-five. However, because the Bank of England, HSBC, and stomach were very good, Chinese merchants and speculators also turned to plugging, causing a softening to appear. The afternoon was even stronger. In the early afternoon, the softening continued to the maintained supply price of Hong Kong. Speculators suddenly changed from plugging back to digging, and the foreign banks' limited appetite and heavy weighting reappeared, turning loose again. In the end, the spot and forward prices of British and American currencies tended to loosen, spot prices were particularly hard, and the swap spread opened up even more. It was heard that at noon, Chinese banks and a certain American bank were willing to sell spot and swap May contracts, posting a U.S. dollar spread of three corners and seventy-five points, with the interest rate reaching more than eight points. However, because cash was exhausted, it was difficult for arbitrageurs to be active.</p>
<p>The Situation Already Shows Loosening</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rates of British pounds against U.S. dollars, Shanghai dollars, and French francs were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell three seventy-five against the British pound, five points against the Shanghai dollar, and half a point against the French franc. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were three pence and fifteen sixty-two five per British pound and four yuan and fifty-six sixty-two five per U.S. dollar, which were harder by 〇thirty-one sixty-two five and looser by 〇sixty-two five, respectively, compared to the close last Saturday. The opening prices of the period were also slightly longer by 〇thirty-one sixty-two five and 〇sixty-two five. After the opening, the situation was stable. The Hong Kong Telegraph seemed to have the intention to maintain the opening price. It was estimated that Chinese merchants and speculators would sell May U.S. dollars to HSBC for four yuan and three seventy-five. HSBC's listed prices were announced, and they were all slightly longer. The exchange rate for British pounds was changed to three pence and one-eighth, and the exchange rate for U.S. dollars was listed at four and a half yuan. The announcement of the silver balance tax showed no increase or decrease. After this, speculators continued to come to plug and sell, and the market became looser. At that time, foreign firms absorbed spot U.S. dollars from speculators at four yuan and eighty-one sixty-two five, and it was heard that the hardest reached four yuan and eighty-seven sixty-two five. Soon after, because speculators suddenly turned to digging, there were more buyers. Fortunately, HSBC and others' supply intentions were not bad, but the price gradually turned softer. Speculators entered HSBC's May U.S. dollars, returning to four yuan and a half to three seventy-five. The momentum was still good until noon. As a result, the closing price was three pence and two eighty-one sixty-two five per British pound and four yuan and sixty-eight sixty-two five per U.S. dollar, with the May British pound at three pence and nine thirty-seven five and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and three seventy-five, both harder by 〇one twenty-five compared to the morning's opening spot prices.</p>
<p>Arbitrage Above Eight Points</p>
<p>The initial opening in the afternoon was tight again, with the British pound at three pence and two fifty and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and sixty-two fifty. However, because this price was close to Hong Kong Telegraph's maintained limit price of three pence and fifteen sixty-two five, speculators saw the scene and turned from buying to selling, and the softening trend was able to be contained. It was estimated that speculators sold May British pounds at three pence and ten ninety-three seventy-five and twelve twenty-five, and U.S. dollars in the same month at four yuan and forty-three seventy-five. After entering, the buyers' appetite was sluggish, and the closing price was still hard, with the British pound at two pence and two eighty-one sixty-two five and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and seventy-five, with the May British pound at three pence and nine thirty-seven five and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and forty-three seventy-five, both longer by one fifty-six twenty-five and looser by two fifty, respectively, compared to the closing spot prices last Saturday. The British and American currencies in this month are both 〇nine thirty-seven five and 〇one twenty-five.</p>

<h3>Foreign Currencies Suddenly Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation saw the British and American gold coins falling and then rising again, finally closing with a continued increase of two yuan. After the British and American gold coins were maintained by the Hong Kong Telegraph through the black market foreign exchange, the market suddenly became loose and hard. The demand from all parties was sharply reduced. The former fell back to 68 yuan, and the latter initially traded at 21 yuan, five corners, and six corners, and then gradually retreated to 20 yuan, five corners. At noon, it was 21 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose as high as 21 yuan, eight corners, finally closing at 21 yuan, one corner, a small four-corner increase compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong tickets fell sharply with the sharp drop in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. French franc tickets were slightly tired. Singapore tickets and rupee tickets were both very weak. Annam tickets and Canadian tickets were in high demand, and the market price rose across the board. Italian tickets and Australian gold tickets have not been traded for a long time. There was a slight transaction yesterday. The market price rose by two corners for Italian tickets and twelve yuan and three corners for Australian surplus tickets compared to before. The supply of Japanese gold tickets from all parties was strong again, and the market price trended down again, retreating to one yuan, two corners, and seven and a half points in the evening market. Korean tickets were slightly in demand, and the evening market was already level with the legal currency.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Discount Rate Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rate discount rate for drafts and bills saw a turnaround and fall. Initially, 210 yuan was required for every 1,000 yuan for those entering a discount, and 190 yuan was required for those exiting a discount. The supply gradually increased, and it gradually fell to 150 yuan. At noon, it rebounded to around 170 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to 175 yuan, 35 yuan lower than last Saturday. The interest rate for the Qianye Association was not changed in either the morning or noon market, and it remained at two corners and five points.</p>
<h3>First Press, Then Lift: Extreme Anxiety in the Gold Market; Peak Reaches 7250 Yuan, Fluctuating 540 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market was volatile, rising more than it fell, but people were uneasy and lacked firm buying and selling intentions. Therefore, it was expected that prices above 7,000 yuan might experience some consolidation. In the early morning, due to the sudden easing of the exchange rate, the price dropped from the opening of 6,800 yuan to 6,710 yuan. Gold shops were reportedly selling, but as the foreign exchange rate softened, the trend reversed. Banks and gold shops successively bought in, and by noon, the price had reached 6,970 yuan. Although a gold shop pushed down the price at the close of the morning session, news of favorable rumors concerning the European war spread, and gold shops aggressively raised prices, exceeding 7,000 yuan to reach 7,030 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange market reported tighter conditions, the opening price was 7,100 yuan, and soon a new unprecedented peak of 7,250 yuan was reached. One gold shop took the lead in aggressively raising prices, but later a securities firm and another gold shop began selling, and the exchange rate slightly recovered, causing the price to gradually fall back to the 7,000 yuan level. The closing price was 7,010 yuan, 100 yuan higher than the previous weekend. The total trading volume for the day was over 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices fluctuated, ultimately increasing by 20 yuan. Customs gold prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Gold Bullion Still Up 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially reported a loose exchange market, and people's hearts were slightly frustrated. The market opened 110 yuan lower, with gold shops selling 20 taels to banks at 6,800 yuan. Subsequently, due to strong selling by gold shops, the price fell again by 90 yuan, reaching a low of 6,710 yuan. However, the trading volume was very small. The banks' buying gradually strengthened, and the market turned upward. Soon, the price returned to the 6,800 yuan level. Later, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported softening, boosting morale further, and securities firms rushed to buy, raising the price by several tens of yuan. Banks traded with each other at 6,900 yuan per tael. Afterwards, as speculators took the opportunity to sell, and buyers gradually decreased, the price fell back by 100 yuan. Speculators sold 30 taels to banks at 6,800 yuan. However, gold shops later bought in, and banks also competed to buy, and as the foreign exchange market continued to report tightening, the price jumped by 170 yuan. Gold shops bought several tens of taels from gold shops and banks, all at 6,970 yuan. Near the close, a gold shop disregarded the market price and pushed the price down by selling, closing at 6,965 yuan. After the close, another gold shop aggressively raised prices, reportedly due to favorable news from Europe, causing sellers to hesitate and raising the price to 7,030 yuan. The trading volume was extremely small. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market reported tighter conditions, boosting morale further. The opening price jumped to 7,100 yuan, and then, with gold shops and retail investors rushing to buy, the price soared again by 150 yuan. Gold shops bought 30 taels from banks at an unprecedented high price of 7,250 yuan. Shortly after, the number of buyers decreased, and selling pressure intensified, gradually falling back to 7,200 yuan. The market became quiet for a time, with slight consolidation. Later, as the foreign exchange market hardened, selling increased, and gold shops and securities firms competed to sell, soon dropping by nearly 200 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms at 7,000 yuan. At that time, speculators and scalpers frequently bought in, pushing the price up to 7,080 yuan. However, eventually, due to further selling by gold shops, and retail investors stopping buying, the price fell back by nearly 70 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops, closing at 7,010 yuan. As a result, the price was 100 yuan higher than the previous Saturday, with a total fluctuation of 540 yuan throughout the day.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Up 20 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price for silver jewelry sold by large silver shops was 700 yuan per tael. At 9:30 AM, the price increased by 10 yuan, at 11:30 AM it increased again by 10 yuan, at 12:00 PM it increased by another 10 yuan, at 12:10 PM it increased by another 10 yuan, and at 2:00 PM it increased again by 10 yuan. At 3:00 PM, it decreased by 10 yuan, and there were no further changes. As a result, the price increased by 20 yuan, and large silver shops changed the price to 720 yuan. New silver shops had the same price as before, and the purchase price decreased by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Active Foreign Shares, Increased Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market was characterized by the fact that although the bulls were struggling, they were still unable to raise their heads. Rumors were rampant, changing rapidly, and people's hearts were shaken and restless. Cautious people mostly held back, and those forced by financial constraints mostly sold. There were few short covering, and even fewer bulls. The monthly interest rate on loans was as high as 40 to 50 percent, so the market price of government bonds was weak, and trading decreased significantly. In the morning, more Tungsun shares were sold, and more Lianhe and Tiansheng shares were also sold. Changji and Tung Yu bought slightly. In the afternoon, more Tungsih shares were sold, and Lianhe also continued to sell. Xinfu and Hongda bulls settled slightly, and Yuankang, Suifu, and retail investors bought. The market still turned from high to low. The result was mixed, with a difference of only 5 cents to 2.5 cents per share. The trading volume was only around 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>200 shares of Hanyeping shares were traded at a price of 4.25 yuan. The Shanghai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce stock market opened vigorously, and trading increased gradually. The price was much higher than the closing price on the previous Friday. There were no major disturbances that day, and the trend was firm, with no sign of turning back for a while.</p>
<p>British &amp; Foreign shares once again occupied the top spot among industrial shares. 52,100 shares were traded, and the price also increased the most compared to the previous week's close. It once reached 75 yuan, and the closing price was 73 yuan with buyers. The other popular shares were International and Jardine Matheson, etc.</p>
<p>The trading volume of Yeguang shares was large, but the price change was very small. After seeing a high price of 17.4 yuan, it returned to 17.2 yuan at the close. The shares that were sold were the easiest to absorb.</p>
<p>From yesterday onwards, all prices of Wheelock Marden shares were marked with the words "ex-rights." The "new share rights" were traded separately. This complicated relationship initially caused hesitation among the general public, resulting in a long delay in trading. Operators needed to think carefully to determine the connection value between the two, so that they could compare them with the closing price of "speed rights" shares from the previous week. After a while, ex-rights shares were traded at 130 yuan, and new share rights were traded at 100 yuan. At the close, the former was 131 yuan and the latter was 98 yuan. Purchasers of new share rights had to pay 25 yuan per share to the company, so the total capital of each new share was 123 yuan. However, the interest on this new share would be calculated from April 1st onwards, and the company's operating profit before that would not be included. Although the exact amount of the old share is unknown, it is believed that there is still a final dividend to be paid. Purchasers should not ignore this, and the difference between the two share prices can be regarded as the market's imagined final dividend of the old share.</p>
<p>Rubber shares were in great demand, and the trend of each share was very active. However, the prices of each share did not rise in the same proportion. The following several types were particularly obvious.</p>
<p>British &amp; Foreign Java closed at 56 yuan the previous day and 60 yuan yesterday. British &amp; Foreign Kotah closed at 29 yuan the previous day and 31.5 yuan yesterday. Langkat closed at 39 yuan the previous day and 47 yuan yesterday. Rubber Trust closed at 37.25 yuan the previous day and 39.25 yuan yesterday. All the above rubber companies are located in the Dutch East Indies, so the only reason they are popular is undoubtedly that these companies are not subject to the foreign exchange restriction regulations, unlike many other British Malayan companies.</p>
<h3>Grains: Exchange Rate Slightly Eases, Foreign Rice Dumped, Demand Surges</h3>
<p>The rice market, due to the unexpected surge in gold prices, initially seemed difficult to contain. However, the market is volatile, and as the gold market and exchange rate stabilized, a downward trend was seen. The initial opening in the morning saw limited activity, and the market was relatively stable. Then, news spread of falling gold prices and a looser exchange rate, causing changes to occur. Calls for sales spread throughout the market, with tight capital and everyone rushing to dump their holdings, resulting in chaos and a loss of market benchmarks. Price declines were inconsistent. Siaochiao rose three levels, while Saigon depreciated nine yards. This is because Siaochiao has recently been entirely controlled by speculation and is most active. Although there are fluctuations, it is mainly a rise with small declines. Yesterday, the lowest price was still 48.8 yuan, and by the close, it still reached 49.5 yuan, only depreciating by half a yuan compared to the previous week's closing price of 50 yuan. The situation for other goods was completely different, with actual sales being slow and fathers being neglected by the mind, leading to a small movement of inventory, deviating from the norm, and falling by two or three yuan. In the past, Niangti rice was priced three or four yuan, or one or two yuan higher than Siaochiao, but now its sales price is almost equal to Siaochiao. The closing price for Saigon No. 1 was only 50 yuan, Saigon No. 2 was around 49 yuan, Siam and fire milled rice were 49.5 yuan, and Siam No. 2 was even cheaper, shorter than Siaochiao by more than one yuan, opening at only 48.3-48.4 yuan. This kind of abnormal development is truly the result of the speculation transaction, which has been rarely seen in the past. Fortunately, the market for broken rice and rice bran was not large, so it was able to maintain its own identity without much fluctuation. High quality rice still sold for 45.5 to 45 yuan, and special broken rice ranged from 43.2 to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of japonica rice from the mainland has become increasingly scarce due to transportation issues. Although the demand from the sales market seems to be strong, it is also constrained by foreign rice and is falling by about one yuan. Special grade Wuxi japonica rice is 51-52 yuan, powdered japonica rice is 50 yuan, Changkun japonica rice is 51-50 yuan, Zhongsu japonica rice is 47-48 yuan, and Qing Si special grade thin rice is 50-48.5 yuan. Nangang early rice rose from 49.5 yuan to 48 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice was originally slow to move, but it is now even more weak and lacking in spirit. Therefore, Jinli rice, originally 43.5-43 yuan, has been lowered to 41-42 yuan, while the worst quality sold for 39.5 yuan, which is more than one yuan lower than the previous trading session.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market had leveled off, as the previous days' soaring prices were entirely created by speculators. In reality, official transactions were observing. Yesterday's market transactions were still driven by speculation, so the market price rose and fell rapidly, changing in an instant. However, with the exchange rate loosening, the price of rice slightly recovered a few cents. Currently, Siaochiao rice is the most popular, with fluctuating prices. The opening price in the morning was 50.3 yuan, rising to 50.5 yuan, and then immediately falling to 48.7 yuan. After rising once in the afternoon, the final price was 49.4 yuan, with no buyers. The prices of other types of rice all showed fluctuations. The returned Saigon No. 2 opened at 59 yuan and closed at 59.7 yuan in the afternoon. The weakness of Xing rice has reached 58.35-58.4 yuan per original package with small grain. The total volume of spot rice traded was 8-9 thousand bags, and the returned original packages totaled more than 600 tons.</p>
<p>Also, foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 5,172 bags, shipped from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson's Yüsheng vessel.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Firm, -- Wheat Still Holding Strong --</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the plate price of the No. 2 Flour Mill remained at 14 yuan. All mills had already raised prices twice in the previous week, and would not raise them further. However, there was a shortage of returned goods, and holders still regarded them as rare commodities, unwilling to release them easily, bidding three or four cents higher than the mill's price. There was no formal agreement on the unified market transaction. In addition to the 5-6 thousand bags directly approved by the mill, only the inland flour had some transactions. It is said that it is more convenient to report inland flour to Shanghai, so the sales to local customers are also more active. The Shunfeng brand produced by the Wuxi mill opened at 14.3 yuan, and later 2-3 thousand bags were traded at 14.25-14.2 yuan. The market is gradually becoming firm.</p>
<p>In addition, a large batch of flour is being shipped north. Today, Jardine Matheson's Chongqing shipped 10,000 bags of flour from Shanghai to Yantai and 6,500 bags to Qingdao. It is said that they are all mill goods, and there are also 3,000 bags of foreign corn shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>The buying and selling of wheat yesterday was still holding strong, and the market had not much change.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Slow, Yarn Market Returns to Looseness, Double Horse Falls 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market had been soaring for days, but yesterday, the foreign exchange rate turned to ease, and people's minds stabilized. The market returned to looseness. However, due to the ongoing European war and the tense situation in the Mediterranean, some people did not give up their bullish outlook, but actual sales were very sluggish.</p>
<p>In the morning, the spot yarn market opened with weakness in the US exchange rate and a lack of buyers in the market, and the market turned to decline. The futures price for 20-count Double Horse was 1740 yuan, and immediately rose to 1770 yuan. The spot price for Double Horse was 1720 yuan. Upon hearing that the price of gold had fallen, actual sales were sluggish, and the price fell again to 1660 yuan. The closing price recovered slightly. It was found that the total transaction volume in the morning was 1,595 packages. The market price for 10-count Double Horse fell 30 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below.</p>
<p>Trade: 1,100 Hong Kong: 485</p>
<p>Mainland: 10 Total: 1,599</p>
<h3>After Exchange Tightens, Some Cotton Merchants Stop Loading Fixed Loans</h3>
<p>The transaction of local cotton is not active, but the trend is very tight. This is because the inventory is dwindling, and people's hearts are firm and bullish, so the selling price is advancing slowly. The details of the spot cotton transactions are listed below.</p>
<p>Huocao: 244.00: Trade in 1,135 bales</p>
<p>Also: 247.00: Also 300 bales</p>
<p>Durilla: 293.00: Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Pingguoer: 228.00: Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Mitelin: 330.00: Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Langgong: 292.00: Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Kangjiang: 290.00: Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Also, the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market, was relatively quiet. A portion of overseas cotton merchants and short covering resulted in the closing price falling one to two pounds for the near term and rising three to five pounds for the long term. The Indian cotton market fell more than two rupees yesterday along with the forecast. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai was relatively quiet due to the extreme tightness of money. However, because there was very little spot on the market, the selling price was still firm and bullish. But calculated according to the current exchange rate, it is still cheap by more than 15%. Due to the tightening of the exchange rate, some traders stopped loading from overseas or slightly covered the losses and bought back from foreign firms, totaling about a thousand bales. According to general opinion, regardless of whether the exchange rate tightens or loosens in the future, the selling price of cotton will rise steadily. The factory price converted at the US exchange rate of 4.5 yuan yesterday is as follows.</p>
<p>20 count: US Mitelin: 87.95</p>
<p>20 count: Also: lower grade 372.80</p>
<p>32 count: Also: 403.60</p>
<p>32 count: Also: lower grade 390.00</p>
<p>42 count: Also: 418.30</p>
<p>42 count: Also: lower grade 406.50</p>
<p>1050 pieces of Indian cotton, loaded on the British company's Hilula, arrived in Shanghai from Mumbai and berthed at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong the day before yesterday to unload.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Speculation Active, Market Price Rises Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the actual transaction of the cloth market was still undeveloped, and speculators were very busy. The market price fluctuated frequently with the rise and fall of the price of gold. The opening price of each commodity was stable in the morning, and the market trend was relatively firm in the afternoon. As a result, white goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. The factory price for autumn blue cloth was very high, while the price of light-colored goods was unable to rise due to seasonal reasons. More than 700 pieces were traded in the street. Guangdong and Fujian traders entered more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders also processed more than 100 pieces. It was found that there were 37 pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Dongbu: The market atmosphere was very sharp in the morning. Longtou fine cloth was 55.25 yuan, but due to the lack of actual sales, it immediately fell. The lowest price was 52.25 yuan. Later, as the price of gold continued to rise, the industry's intention to enter the market improved, and the price gradually recovered. Therefore, the closing price of Longtou fine cloth was 54.25 yuan, 56.5 yuan this month, and Drill current sales increased to 1.5425 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cakes Sell Well, Soybeans Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market, although the oil market was weak, the sales of bean cakes were active (the price rose sharply by 30-40 cents. 20,000 pieces were processed and went to Shantou, Quanzhou, Fuhua, etc.) Therefore, the foundation was consolidated and the market price continued to rise by 40-50 cents.

<h3>Tumultuous Controversy in the American Education Community: Dr. Russell Ruled by the Court Not to Teach at New York College</h3>
<p>The renowned British philosopher and mathematician Dr. Russell, formerly a British Earl, abandoned his noble status, preferring to live as a commoner. He is currently a philosophy professor at the University of California. On February 26th of this year, the City College of New York hired him to be a philosophy professor from February next year, with an annual remuneration of $8,000. A Mrs. Kai, whose two children have reached school age, petitioned the New York City Board of Higher Education on March 19th in her capacity as a taxpayer. She argued that Russell advocated "immoral and obscene free love doctrines" as a reason to terminate his employment. On March 30th, Justice McCook of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that hiring Russell as a professor at the City College was not only "a stain on academic integrity" but also "an insult to the residents of New York City," and ordered the City Board of Higher Education to terminate Russell's employment.</p>
<p>The judgment document is seventeen pages long and states that according to the New York State Education Law, Russell, not having obtained American citizenship, cannot teach in the state. The New York City Board of Higher Education's approval of Russell's employment without examination procedures also violated the New York State Constitution. "Most unconscionable" was that such employment would "endanger the public health, safety, and morals of the people."</p>
<p>After the verdict was announced, Mrs. Kai called it "a victory for every parent in New York City and a victory for justice and purity." Professor Russell, from the University of California in Los Angeles, cabled that "he did not want to comment at this stage and was seeking legal advice." It is also unknown whether the Board of Higher Education will appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union has cabled Russell, expressing its willingness to provide support. Bishop Manning, who first attacked Russell in an open letter to the newspaper on March 1st, "does not want to comment at this time."</p>
<p>Dr. Hotchkiss, Vice President of the University of California, said that the school had no criticism of Russell's scholarship and teaching methods. His decision to leave the school this spring was entirely voluntary. Payne, editor of the California student publication, expressed his opinion, saying, "This matter is a tragedy for American education. The New York State Court's ruling that Russell is not qualified to teach in the state is nonsensical. No professor I have studied with surpasses Russell. His students must be outraged by this verdict. If the University of California can find a way to retain Russell, the entire faculty and student body would welcome it. I took two courses taught by Russell and never heard him mention any moral issues."</p>
<p>Russell's third wife, Patricia, said, "We are guests in a foreign land and do not know the legal procedures. How to proceed will be handled by lawyers in New York. Although we do not want to cause trouble, we have no choice. The crux of this case is an issue of civil rights and academic freedom, concerning countless intellectuals. We cannot remain silent at this point." Russell's students are petitioning the University of California authorities to retain him, and many of his colleagues have also risen to defend him. Dr. Reichenbach, a philosophy professor at California, said, "We all know that Professor Russell is a great philosopher of our time. This verdict by the New York court is outrageous." Russell's student, Betty, said, "It is a rare privilege to hear Dr. Russell lecture. He is indeed a noble scholar, and my morals have never been corrupted by him."</p>
<p>When Justice McCook distributed the judgment to reporters, he said that he had studied Russell's works late into the night before making this judgment. The first six pages of the judgment explained the issues of citizenship and examination, while the remaining eleven pages denounced Russell's views on sexual behavior, citing the theories in four of Russell's books as the basis. The judgment concluded, "Teachers have more power to influence students' thoughts than various terms. Assuming Russell were allowed to teach at the City College for two years without promoting his views, it would still violate the academic regulations mentioned above. Russell's philosophy and behavior directly contradict New York State criminal law. Academic freedom, a right, should never be used as a pretext to mislead young people and violate criminal law." (Translated from the March 31st New York Herald Tribune)</p>

<h3>Harvard University Declares Russell's Appointment Still Valid</h3>
<p>The New York Times reported that Harvard University officials stated that the university had already hired Professor Russell as a lecturer in philosophy and semantic evolution for half a semester. Although the New York Supreme Court has ruled that Russell is not allowed to teach at the City College of New York, Harvard University's appointment is not affected. The university has always advocated that all teachers should enjoy "academic freedom." According to reports, when Harvard University announced the appointment of Russell as a lecturer two years ago, Massachusetts State Representative Dooling also protested, citing the same reasons as those listed in New York. Before the New York City Board of Higher Education's decision, there was a great dispute in the church and education communities regarding the issue of hiring Russell. Therefore, a special meeting was held to discuss it, and by a vote of eleven to seven, the motion to reconsider Russell's employment was defeated. Russell is 67 years old and has been divorced twice. He is now married for the third time.</p>

<h3>Spring Welcoming Ceremony</h3>
<p>Although welcoming spring is an ancient custom, the ceremonial arrangements are the same everywhere. This year's spring welcoming ceremony in Hangzhou is more elaborate than in previous years, also a sign of peace and prosperity. On the 13th day of the first month, the weather was clear and fine. Spectators filled the area from Qingchun Gate to the intersection of Puan Street, as well as Henghe Bridge and Shipailou, a distance of three or four li, with hardly any space to stand. On that day, the three prefectural officials and the officials of the two counties under its jurisdiction, all dressed in their official robes and hats, arranged a full set of ceremonial items. They went to the Governor's office to offer spring greetings, then took warm sedan chairs out of Qingchun Gate to Shangxin Temple. First, they performed the spring plowing ceremony, then respectfully welcomed the God of Spring into the city. The officials then changed to ornate sedan chairs and returned to their offices. The God of Spring was then paraded around to the various government offices. The next day, he was taken to the Wushan Tai Sui Temple to be enshrined, restoring him to his former position. When welcoming the spring, around noon, the sound of gongs and drums vibrated, and the sound of Sheng and Guan harmonized. First, there were several decorated pavilions, each with vases and other items. Next, there were dozens of pairs of gold-lettered plaques, all with phrases such as "Good weather for the crops," "Five grains abundant," and so on. Then there were four raised platforms, each with two people dressed as the Eight Immortals. Following them was a paper ox, carried on poles, with the same colors as depicted in the Spring Ox Diagram. Behind it was a person leading a live ox slowly, as it was the ox that the Tai Sui would plow with. People seeing it would scramble to pull out its hair, believing it would bring good luck. In the afternoon, there was usually a spring official, who often mingled in the crowd, making it impossible to identify him. This was because the people of Hangzhou would scramble to beat the spring official, calling it "Beating the Spring." The ceremony will be continued tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Being a World Citizen (3)</h3>
<p>What should we do? Science is valuable and must be preserved. So, let's eliminate narrow-mindedness. But how do we eliminate it? Honestly, we all have this narrow-minded tendency. We are narrow, selfish, and cruel, but to varying degrees. Are we going to eliminate humanity to eradicate it? That won't work. We have to settle for the next best thing: transforming narrow-minded people into broad-minded people, short people into giants, and narrow-minded people into godly beings. Therefore, people today need the following three things: (1) A world-mindedness: A person's mind should be broad, not just deep. Narrow-minded people have narrow minds, while godly people have broad minds. If you want to know how broad-minded someone is, just look at what they pray for. For example, if someone only prays four times for us and then stops, you know how narrow-minded they are. Most people pray like this: "God, watch over my child at school, Jane in the office, Mom in the kitchen, and Dad in the factory, Amen." But don't they know that there are more people than just these who need our prayers? That's why Jesus taught us to pray, "Our Father," "Our daily bread," "Our sins." The word "our" includes everyone. A new magazine in the United States called "World Affairs" discusses all issues from a global perspective. If we read this magazine, our minds will become world-minded. When we pray, we won't limit ourselves to our own families. We'll include black, white, red, yellow, and people of all colors in our prayers. This is one of the greatest needs. (2) A world-conscience: Everyone has a conscience. However, some people have narrow consciences. They have a conscience in certain places or about certain things, but not in others. For example, someone may not want to steal from their mother, but they will take the opportunity to rob their neighbors. Such a conscience is a threat to social security.

<h3>On the Physique of the Chinese Nation from an Anthropological Perspective</h3>
<p>— Nan Jun</p>
<p>In this day of bloody strife, the law of the jungle seems to have become the common rule of evolution. The fact that our great Chinese nation is being trampled upon by others is undeniable. The external pressure and urgency of national subjugation and racial extinction are recognized by everyone as having reached the most critical point. We must grit our teeth, exert our greatest strength in resistance, and embark on a bright path to seek human freedom and equality. However, some patriots often think of the question of racial inferiority, that is, "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese nation?" Indeed, the rise and fall of a nation and the prosperity and decline of a race involve various complex factors. But from the perspective of the nation itself, it occupies an important position among these factors. We will temporarily set aside the facts of spiritual culture and, from an anthropological viewpoint, analyze the physique of the nation to understand our own physical condition in the world. This is also a meaningful thing.</p>
<p>Based on known materials, the physique of the Chinese nation can be analyzed according to the criteria of human classification to obtain the following results. These contributions from anthropologists are indeed common knowledge that ordinary people should know to understand themselves. For the sake of clarity, they are described as follows:</p>
<p>Height: The height of Chinese people varies from north to south. The average height of people in Hebei is 1690 mm, while the average height of people in Guangdong is 1618 mm, a difference of 72 mm. The other provinces are in between these two extremes. From this, it can be seen that the height of Chinese people can be classified into three categories: tallest, tall, and medium. At the same time, it can be said that the height of Chinese people is directly proportional to geographical latitude. Compared with the world's population, we are in the "medium" category.</p>
<p>Head Shape: Head shape is the most important standard for human classification, generally divided into three types, according to the cephalic index. Long-headed people account for 14.41% of Chinese people, medium-headed people account for 42.14%, and broad-headed people account for 43.47%. In terms of geographical distribution, long-headed people are more common in the north, called the Yellow River type; medium-headed people are more common in the central region, called the Yangtze River type; and broad-headed people are more common in the south, called the Pearl River type. The size of the head shape is closely related to brain capacity. From an evolutionary perspective, the degree of evolution of broad-headed and medium-headed people is higher.</p>
<p>Hair: The hair of Chinese people is a coarse, long, straight hair, rarely curly or wavy. The cross-section under a microscope is round or nearly round, and usually black. According to anatomical studies, wavy hair is closest to apes, followed by straight hair, and woolly hair is the highest. From the perspective of human evolutionary history, because our body hair is sparse, we seem to be far above Caucasians. Furthermore, according to the law of heredity, black hair is superior in color. Therefore, our hair is indeed in the highest position in the evolution of the world's population.</p>
<p>Skin Color: The superiority of skin color in the evolutionary process does not involve aesthetic considerations. From the facts of disease resistance, it is known that black skin is the strongest, followed by yellow skin, and white skin is the weakest. Yellow people are easily adaptable to both cold and hot zones, so Chinese people can live no matter where they emigrate, and rarely suffer from illness due to acclimatization. This advantage is a natural characteristic of yellow skin.</p>
<p>Lips: The thickness of the lips is also an important piece of evidence in human evolution. According to animal morphology, the lips of Caucasians are the thinnest, which seems to be closer to apes, followed by yellow people, and black people are indeed the most "humanized".</p>
<p>Facial Angle: A straight line from the forehead to the tip of the nose, and another line from the nose to the ear, the angle formed by the intersection of the two lines is called the facial angle. According to the inference of evolutionary theory, the greater the facial verticality, that is, the smaller the facial angle, the lower his intelligence; conversely, it is higher. The facial angle of Chinese people is between that of black and white people. If intelligence is indeed closely related to the size of the facial angle, then their natural intelligence belongs to the middle level, not inferior.</p>
<p>Eyes: The eye color of Chinese people is usually dark brown, not black. The degree of opening is medium, and there is often a layer called the "Mongolian fold" at the inner corner near the nose, but its function is unknown. The shape of the eyes is slightly slanted, called almond eyes, that is, the outer corner is slightly higher than the inner corner.</p>
<p>Nose: In the evolutionary process, the nose shape of Caucasians is high and narrow, occupying the most superior position. Most Chinese people have medium noses, and the form of broad noses is especially prominent in southern people, perhaps due to climate reasons. In this respect, Chinese people seem to be lower.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are the criteria used in racial taxonomy. Upon close examination, it is known that the physical structure of Chinese people is not in an inferior position. Compared with other races in the world, it shows many advantages, and shows the fact of "medium" everywhere. Thinking from the standpoint of biological evolution, "medium" may be the result of eliminating inferiority and retaining superiority. With this kind of scientific analysis, it can greatly break our self-doubting concepts. From this, it can be seen that today's being invaded by others is definitely not based on the problem of racial inferiority. Of course, there are other complex factors, such as social organization, political system, popular knowledge, and patriotic thought, which are very important factors.</p>
<p>We don't need to despise each other, and we should unite the entire nation as one. "Know yourself first, and then proceed with your work" is a commendable motto. Indeed, ancient nations inevitably decline, but new stimuli, pressures, and trampling may also be the greatest driving force for regeneration. A glorious future will be opened up from this.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>The Entertainment of Heads of State</h3>
<p>— Song Jinglian</p>
<p>According to recent news from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the eighteen-year-old King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to take a pilot test in order to obtain a pilot's license. In fact, this news is not surprising to those who know the king, because King Farouk is exceptionally healthy and is already very fond of various outdoor sports.</p>
<p>Since the tragedies of King Albert of Belgium falling to his death while mountaineering in 1934 and the Queen of Belgium dying in a car accident in 1935, heads of state around the world still take dangerous sports (such as flying and driving) as their leisure activities, just as King Farouk of Egypt is dedicated to driving airplanes.</p>
<p>However, the life of a head of state is very important, so the British House of Commons has intervened in this matter. The House of Commons requested King George V to order the then heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor), not to ride horses excessively. George V himself was also very fond of horseback riding. He would ride a horse to Hyde Park every day and was also good at yachting and a skilled helmsman. The boldest was former King Alfonso XIII of Spain. He was a good horse rider and car driver. When he was traveling in Bordeaux, France, he was stopped by a traffic police officer for speeding.</p>
<p>King Carol of Romania now only plays with his son by riding horses and skating. Before he ascended the throne, he loved flying and took an airplane to regain the throne.</p>
<p>King Boris of Bulgaria likes to drive cars and trucks at high speed on the rugged roads of Bulgaria. He also likes to drive trains and has obtained a license from Bulgarian railway technicians and is honored to be elected as the honorary president of the Railway Workers' Union.</p>
<p>As for the entertainment of the Emperor of Sweden, I think everyone knows that he is a tennis master.</p>
<p>Prince Olav of Norway likes to ride motorcycles.</p>
<p>The elderly King Christian of Denmark likes to travel by bicycle.</p>
<p>Hitler does not like outdoor sports. As for his brother in difficulty, Mussolini, it is the opposite. Whether it is airplanes, cars, motorcycles, horseback riding, swimming, race walking... he has a share in everything. Mussolini is indeed versatile and can also speak several languages!</p>
<p>French President Lebrun likes to ride horses and stroll in the Rambouillet forest.</p>
<p>The entertainment of the following heads of state is very different from the above, and is in the field of art: King Carlos I of Portugal, who was assassinated in 1908, was a famous painter and won gold medals twice at the French Salon exhibition and the Paris Exposition in 1900.</p>
<p>Queen Mother Elizabeth of Romania, who came from the British royal family, is a prolific writer. In history, Queen Victoria was good at painting, especially depicting rural scenery, and always had a small sketchbook in her luggage. The unparalleled beauty Queen Marie Antoinette liked to carve scenes of Paris on buttons. Napoleon III's mother was good at watercolor painting and portraiture.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about Hitler. Although he is not good at sports, he is a painter. A few years ago, the editor-in-chief of the Berliner Morgenpost published a collection of watercolors, which included the works of a corporal during the European War, signed Adolf Hitler.</p>

Those who are stubborn insist on persevering, but greater hidden damage breaks out, forcing them to fall into bed. The period for seeing a doctor is one week for the former, and even two or three years for the latter. The medical expenses are of course considerable, and the loss of business for a week or two or three years is even greater. The working time in a day is eight hours. When you work for ten hours and think you are diligent enough, you don't know that you have lost a portion of your spirit that must be preserved. After a month or two, you will gradually feel unsustainable. If you continue to do this, you will need to rest for a longer period. Then, your business will stop, your savings will be depleted, and time will slowly pass.</p>
<p>If you have to work so hard because of the heavy burden of life, please pay attention to the following points: go to bed early, sleep more, be silent, worry less, and avoid wild thoughts. As for playing cards, making trouble, and drinking excessive alcohol, these are not games that benefit the body and mind. Normal entertainment, such as music and walking, are free and may be increased appropriately.</p>

<h3>Film Workers' Guide: The Functions and Responsibilities of Cinematography</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>There are good film criticisms in the newspapers, but there are also bad ones. He would blame the actors for the director's mistakes; he would attribute the director's strengths to the cinematographer. Here I briefly explain the six major functions and responsibilities of film art, hoping that the general audience and film critics will use a more advanced perspective to examine the merits and demerits of a film:</p>
<p>Screenwriter</p>
<p>His responsibility is to make the theme of a movie upright, the content rich, and in line with the times. He must avoid unclear themes, empty content, banality, absurdity, nonsense, no social significance, and no artistic value, etc.</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>He wants to use film techniques to concretely put the script handed down by the screenwriter on the screen. He has to manage the rhythm of the whole play. Where can he be understated? Where should important arrangements be made? How to grasp the key moment of the play? How to prevent the audience's mood from relaxing? He also has to clearly distinguish the personalities of each character in the play, and do not make an actor suddenly reveal different personalities in the same play. He should mobilize other collaborators, such as musicians, sound engineers, and cinematographers, to help the progress of his play, and how to control his actors from acting like a civilized drama.</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>Whether he personally does well, does well. He should carefully study the role he plays. Personality, action, tone, attitude, demeanor, how a certain scene should be expressed, and how a certain scene should reveal his true feelings. If he is underdone or overdone, and his movements and attitudes are not enough of an artist's status, then it is his mistake.</p>
<p>Set Designer</p>
<p>He should arrange to create a "environment" suitable for the plot, and whether the atmosphere of the scene is sufficient is also worth investigating.</p>
<p>Cinematographer</p>
<p>Lighting is his important mission. The light money for each scene should be completely unified. Strong scenes should use hard lines and lighting. Beautiful and lyrical scenes should use soft and light tones. Happy scenes should use bright tones, and so on.</p>
<p>Sound Engineer</p>
<p>His responsibility is to adjust the language and sound. The pitch and intensity of the sound should be suitable for the development of the plot. However, the crudeness of the machinery and other insufficient material conditions are not his fault.</p>
<p>The reporter of this newspaper said the following words at the end of his communication: "The citizens of Chongqing and several other larger cities in inland China, such as Chengdu, are the same. They now crave high-end music as much as other living conditions, so they are very welcome to singing groups from various places to come and perform."</p>
<h3>"Su Xijiao" and Zhang Wenyuan's Expression</h3>
<h3>After Watching Selling Unicorn (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>Because in that play, the faces of "poverty and wealth", "snobbery", "good and evil", "cause and effect", "natural disasters" and "man-made disasters" are thoroughly revealed. Especially the fact that the rich man with ten thousand guans of wealth may immediately become a poor man, as well as the two points of doing good and getting blessings and knowing how to repay kindness, can be said to contain sufficient stimulation in today's world.</p>
<p>The playwright has put a lot of thought into the arrangement, and many humorous dialogues are really to the point, making people laugh and cry. In this satisfactory arrangement, there are many new contributions. Several scenes completely borrow car dialogues and are absolutely dramatized. For example, when there is a flood, the water god is not used to pass the scene, but the crowd shouts "The flood is coming" behind the curtain, which is also a reform worthy of praise. The several plays recently written by Yanqiu do have small reforms that make people's ears and eyes refreshed, and this play is even more progressive.</p>
<p>Speaking of technology, Yanqiu's work has always been admired, especially in acting sad plays. Xue Xiangling in the first part is a daughter of a thousand gold, and Yanqiu still has an extraordinary performance, depicting Xiangling's pampered and extravagant beauty, with graceful and dignified manners. When watching the dowry, the water sleeves have two wonderful postures. Speaking of singing, this play can be said to let the audience enjoy the drama to the fullest. The most important are two segments of erliu, one segment of erhuang, and one segment of xipi. The first segment of erliu is the scene of sheltering from the rain in the Spring and Autumn Pavilion. After this segment of erliu, it turns into a allegro. There is a good tune in the fourth sentence of the blank mouth "Presumably it is a newlywed couple crossing the Magpie Bridge", and there is a good tune in the three words "Crossing the Magpie Bridge". It turns to Allegro later, and there are even better tunes, especially the last sentence of each paragraph, and the closing tune is never the same, which is not easy. Among the lyrics, there are sentences with seven characters and sentences with six characters, which are even more novel. When Ban Tianlin travels to Aunt's place, he sings erhuang slow board, and finally sings a large section of erliu with a crying head. There are many new tunes in total, but due to space limitations, it is not convenient to list them one by one. In short, Yanqiu's tune is not easy to learn in the first place, and the tune used in this play makes people feel that "it sounds good to listen to, but it is difficult to learn." As for the supporting roles, the distribution seems to be slightly inappropriate. Furongcao should play Zhao Shuzhen, and Zhang Chunyan should play Lu Han. It is said that this play by Yanqiu is still being rehearsed for the first time, and for the convenience of future performances, Wu Fuqin is assigned to play Zhao Shuzhen, then the role of Meixiang is quite important. Why not assign Cao Ergeng, but assign Liu Binkun. The performance results show that Liu Binkun's Meixiang is the best. Binkun plays an ugly girl, which is rarely seen, and playing Meixiang in this play is just right. In the same scene as Yanqiu, he has the beauty of setting off the most, and Binkun can not make the audience laugh with his big voice and strange strength. He completely wins with his acting skills and small movements, which is worth applauding. Furongcao's Gu Yunsu's play is not much, and there is no room for his talents. Cao Ergeng's ugly girl and Li Xiaolong's Hu Jie are extremely funny. Wu Fuqin's Zhao Shuzhen and Zhang Chunyan's Xue Liang are both competent. Sun Futing, Li Siguan, Cishaoquan are mediocre. There are many actors in this play, and the entire Huangquan troupe is almost completely dispatched. Judging from the performance results, this play is still worth watching.</p>
<h3>The Recording of a Choir's Performance in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>In the past month, a newspaper in Boston, USA, published a Chongqing communication. The content described the recent performance of a choir jointly composed of Chinese and Western followers of Jesus in the local area. Now the original text is excerpted and translated as follows:</p>
<p>The leader of the group is a Canadian named Gada Anniu. There are a total of 58 members, including foreign missionaries and students from the five major universities in Chengdu. A total of three performances were given in Chongqing, and the venue was借借國泰大戲院 (illegible characters). The state of crowding was unbelievable at each performance. As for the songs sung, they can be divided into two types; one is simply irrelevant to the War of Resistance, and the other is absolutely capable of influencing the War of Resistance. The former includes famous songs such as "The Night of the Danube", and the latter includes "Resistance Song" "Song of Resisteuce" compiled by Huang Jun, etc. In addition, a Buddhist hymn was also sung; it is really a strange thing in the world for a choir composed of Jesus's followers to sing a Buddhist hymn. The group has identified 7,000 yuan of the performance income to donate to Chinese war orphans.</p>
<p>Speaking of the activities of the group besides the three performances on stage, it was to accept the welcoming parties from various local parties; and broadcast several times. When Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi often arrived in Chongqing, he specially set up a banquet to wash away the dust.</p>
<h3>A Shortcut to Beauty</h3>
<p>— Printed</p>
<p>Once, the Paramount Pictures company authorities asked a beautiful actress a question: "What method do you think can make one's appearance beautiful?" Among the answers, twelve people said that sufficient sleep is the best method, three people introduced several beauty products: one said to exercise more and eat fewer snacks, one said to drink more boiled water; and another said to bathe more; all can make one's appearance beautiful.</p>

<h3>Jin Suqin and Hua Huilin — Will Perform in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Sea</p>
<p>Since Jin Suqin's performance at the Lee Theatre did not materialize, she has been enjoying a leisurely life there. She is not preparing to return to Shanghai for the time being. Recently, she asked a friend who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong to get the script and head ornaments of "The Hatred of Life and Death" from her younger sister Suwen, as if she is about to be active again.</p>
<p>The reporter recently received a letter from a friend in Hong Kong, saying that Rui Qingrong is said to be forming a troupe there, preparing to have Jin Suqin and Hua Huilin as the backbone, and is in contact with the Lee Theatre and the Taiping Theatre. Regarding this news, Suwen was asked about it, and she also admitted that there was such a thing. In that case, Suqin's getting the script and head ornaments is a preparation for performing, and not just a coincidence.</p>
