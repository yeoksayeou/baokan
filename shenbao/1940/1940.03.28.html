<h3>綏西戰役及其意義</h3>
<p>三數日來，南北戰塲之華軍均收穫重大戰果：於最右翼之桂南則克復靈山，日軍退向邕欽附近：最左翼之綏西則連克五原新舊城西山咀及五臨一帶各據點，殲日軍達三千餘。捷　頻傳，萬衆騰歡，一若對日方支離滅裂之政治攻勢作事實上之答覆者。桂南戰局，離海陸邊界不遠，而又逼近西南腹地，最為中外所屬目，其戰情演進，類多耳熟能詳；至於綏西部分，其重要性或允甚於桂南，顧以僻處荒陬，易蒙忽視，爰就所見，略事論列。</p>
<p>綏西地方，括有安北五原臨河三縣，亦即所謂後套地帶，大靑山脈綿延於北，黃河環流於南，烏拉山橫亘於中，其間則為廣袤之黃土平原。雖地近朔方，易令人起絕漠荒寒之聯想，實則土壤肥腴，蘊藏富饒，為中國最具厚望之倉庫與牧塲，蓋不僅具軍事價値已也。惟其地久隸蒙旗，設治較遲，庚子而後，始有大規模墾殖之策進。今日之匪偽渠魁王英。甘為虎倀，然其父王同春固昔日筆路藍縷開闢綏西之功臣也。其地蒙漢雜處，易肇勃谿，近歲日方復肆行搆煽於其間，輒假所謂內蒙自治問題之名，乃一再蛻變而為背叛祖國之醞釀。民廿四五年間，陰謀殆屆巔峯；一方日本特務機關遍綏省全境，且遠達寧屬之定遠營與居延，他方則日偽假張北百靈廟為根據地，企圖沿綏寧推進以窺新疆，俾隔斷中蘇交通，日完成對外蒙之大包圍。其間雖經紅格爾圖百靈廟之役，日偽鎩羽而退，乃轉瞬全面抗戰爆發，綏包不守，西侵之勢轉亟。幸賴傅作義馬占山及蒙回各部艱苦支撑，轉戰於大靑烏拉兩山與河套朔漠之間，修明軍政，撫輯流亡，且不時以奇兵為游擊，綏西半壁乃得綏靖，於其時，日軍在其所佔區域內遍修公路，力建工事；且於扶持偽蒙政權煙慕之下，積極從事進攻蒙蘇之軍事配備。故年餘以來綏西戰局之貌若相安，實因日軍角逐中原正亟，乏充分實力用之朔漠；同時任日閥亦未嘗小視綏西有類囊中物，視為儘可不必亟亟；而日方實從未停戢其西進北侵之貪慾，且始終視綏省為北戰塲中重要之支點。論者或謂綏遠為日本在中國本部軍事上最不肯輕易放棄之一環，衡之近衛聲明及日方公私文告，殆屬不移之諭。</p>
<p>客歲十二月下旬，華軍以輕騎奇襲，衝入包頭，巷戰崇朝，復於收得戰果後全師而退，日軍驚恚之餘，乃厚集援軍，於一月中分由包頭安北入侵後套，且一度進抵綏寗邊境之黃楊木頭。論者曾或以日軍繼續深入危及國際交通為慮，殊小知日軍不過行險儌幸以圖一逞，初非有縝密規畫與部署。其時適値隆冬，黃河水淺，已失天險作用，晋綏沿河日軍絕未大舉渡河以事策應，足見日軍雖於綏西有其大慾，然其孤軍深入，則所志當不過奢。是以日軍一度抵達髯邊之際，實力即見衰竭之象，即使後勁繼進，亦必因石嘴山之天險，及三數百里絕無人煙之荒磧，將患飛渡無從。綏西渠道縱橫密布，微類江南水鄉，日軍及其機械化部隊縱能縱橫於冰凍之候，亦必將大感拮据於春初冰解之餘。果也二月中旬華軍反攻即迭奏膚功，臨河陝壩相繼克復，復經苦戰月餘而五原兩城，，烏拉山麓，亦皆重入華軍掌握，日軍西侵勢必以此役吿段落焉。</p>
<p>綏西桂南之同時吿捷，其間特殊意義亦有可得而言者。日軍戰鬥力之日即衰頹為無容諱飾之事實，年餘以前，日軍攻勢雖見緩弛，遠不若最初之鋒銳，然凡所佔據，稍經時日，日車防禦工事即告組成，而不易反攻，及至今茲，事實既足證明日軍守勢亦已遠遜往昔之堅强。中傷抗戰者流，每譏華軍從未攻克名城，此其根本謬誤，在於故意抹煞「消耗戰略」之本質與目的；然近日所克五原，為綏西重鎭，西北樞紐，漢唐迄今，皆為塞北防戍要塞；日方此度進佔亦有久守之意，則此一據點之克復，其意義自極深遠，其影響自非等閒。此其一。綏西在“人夙視為切斷中蘇交通包圍外蒙之根據地，乃三數牛來，其實力僅能覇佔綏東，迄未獲逞其西侵北進之夢想。此度甫經嘗試，輙敗衂隨之，此在日軍北進戰略上當為嚴重打擊。此其二。分化民族團結，挑撥　部惡感，為侵略者所擅長之慣技，邇來頻事宣傳蒙回漢傾軋，國共磨擦等謠言，要亦希圖挑撥分化而已。而此次五原之戰，據合衆社消息，參與作戰者有馬鴻逵寗夏回軍騎兵及馬占山東北騎兵，八路軍游擊部隊，傅作義之步兵，內蒙自衛隊及中央軍密切合作，同時攻擊。足見中國各族各派始終比肩作戰，共為民族宣勞，絕無嫌隙可言；此既可證明各族部衆間之精誠團結，復足掃除磨擦衝突等不根讕言，此其三。</p>
<p>中日戰陣雖綿亘數千公里，而最近局勢實着重於最左與最右之兩翼；此兩翼者，亦即可象徵日閥南進北進之歧途。今兩翼日軍既同歸敗衂，則不論此後日方在政治方面如何嘗試，其軍事方面前途之展望，實不難逆覩也。</p>

<h3>法總理將召集　駐歐使節會議　檢討國際時局</h3>
<p>巴黎　據消息靈通人士所知、內閣總理兼外長萊諾、擬於短時期內、召集法國駐歐洲大使舉行會議、檢討國際時局、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英戰時內閣　行將改組</h3>
<p>倫敦　據路透社國會訪員聲稱、外間紛紛猜測反對黨議員有早日加入內閣之可能、探諸各方、認此說為然者絕少、惟據現象觀之、政府之組織不日似將更動、以較小之團體專以指揮戰事、防務部領袖之更動者大約不止一人也、（廿七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>佛羅倫斯　天降紅沙</h3>
<p>米蘭　義大利北部之佛羅倫斯地方、本日忽大降紅沙、所有樹葉均薄罩紅沙一層、遙望如霜後楓葉、惹人矚目、（二十七日海通社電）</p>
<h3>法政府要求蘇聯　撤換駐法大使　蘇里資賀電竟觸法之忌　英法對邦交不受影響</h3>
<p>倫教　據塔斯通訊社消息、蘇聯駐法大使蘇里資、現已免職、因蘇當局認其不復為法政府所喜之使節也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯外交界人士今日午後稱、法國政府要求蘇聯政府召回駐法大使蘇里資之事件、不至引起兩國邦交之決裂、法國駐蘇聯大使館自那齊雅大使離任後、迄今祇有代辦攝理館務、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日有人以蘇聯駐法大使蘇里資之召回、對於英蘇關係是否有任何影響、詢諸某發言人、據答稱、英蘇關係並無變動、蘇里資之被召回、純屬法蘇兩政府與蘇氏本人間之事件、對於英政府毫無關係云、據路透社所得消息、法政府此次所提出之電文、顯然並非享受外交權利之文件、而實係該大使代表巴黎蘇聯僑民所發之電文、該電係用法文明碼、故受法方通常之檢查、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間一般人對於法方在莫斯科之交涉、結果致赫聯召回其駐法大使蘇里資者、可表示法國欲見其權利受人尊重之堅決意志、蓋法國雖願與各中立國維持良好之關係、但對於以中立為護符而作眞正不利法國之行為者、則將難予以容忍、蘇聯自戰事開始以來、曾屢次要求一切中立國之權利、　共與德國陸續簽訂協定、法國仍加照允兩國間雖維持經常關係、但法國不願遭受愚弄、法方認為蘇芬和約簽訂後、該大使所致史丹林之電文、其中措辭實為外交家所不許、法政府立即施行之有力行動、據謂乃完全在國際範圍之內、惟與最近禁厭國內一切不利協的國舉動所採取之各種手段、不無關運云、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　三月十九日法國駐莫斯科參贊貝耶得、通知蘇聯人民外交委員會主席莫洛託夫云、「蘇芬和約簽訂時、蘇聯駐　法大使蘇里資電賀史丹林（該電由蘇氏簽字、並交由巴黎電局拍返莫斯科）法政府認為蘇氏此種舉動、係干涉法國國內之政治生活、」貝耶得之通知書復稱、「法政府對該電文某某數段、認為不妥、該電文中有云、「由於蘇聯政府賢明政策之實施、以及吾紅軍之英勇、企圖擴展東北歐戰禍之英法戰爭挑釁家所規定之計劃已吿失敗、（英法戰爭挑釁家計劃數字下加綫）同時蘇聯仍係一不可攻克之堡壘、社會主義之敵人以及全世界勞動大衆、敵人之陰謀將來亦必被粉碎、（社會主義敵人陰謀數字下加綫）、該項電文雖已被檢查員扣留、但法政府仍聲明該政府不復視蘇里資為一外交代表一、　深盼蘇聯政府即將蘇氏召回一、</p>
<p>關於此點、蘇聯人民外交委昌會副主席魯柴夫斯基、昨巳將蘇聯政府之復文交貝耶得、復文云、「（一）查蘇氏電文中並未提及法政府、但法政府竟根據該電而不復視蘇氏為「外交代表」蘇聯政府認為法方此種態度全無理由、（二）雖然法政府今旣正式提出對蘇氏之信任問題、蘇聯政府頃特聲明、蘇氏將被免駐法大使之職」、（二十七日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>義匈談話結果　制定此後合作大綱　保全東南歐之和平</h3>
<p>羅馬　匈牙利總理戴萊基、昨日午後訪晤墨索里尼首相相與談話、齊亞諾外長及匈國駐義公使維拉尼時亦在座、官方發表公報稱、談話歷兩小時之久、經過情形頗為懇切、當即為兩國此後合作制定大綱、抑兩國友誼、匪特與義德兩國暨德匈兩國之關係完全相適應、亦且與義國與南斯拉夫之關係並行不悖、要之、義匈兩國政府當調整其行動、以保全巴爾幹半島及多瑙河流域之和平、（二十七日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>羅馬　戴萊基總理定於本月二十八日午前、覲見敎皇庇護十二世、然後於晚間遄返匈京、此間「講壇報」頃載有戴萊基總理談話、略謂「余此行並無特殊目標、僅就國際局勢與義國當局交換意見而已、目下巴爾幹半島並無擾亂、但此非各項問題均已解決之謂、我國對於現行困難、知之甚諗、故具所持態度實與歐洲之迫切需要相適應、抑且頗能忍耐、當靜待時局之發展、至於我國與南斯拉夫國邦交友好、並可賡續改善、惟兩國間米必立即簽訂何項協定」、此外、我國對蘇聯關係亦屬正常、匈蘇兩國邊境、從未發生糾紛云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>匈京　匈政府喉舌報「斯特勞合報」頃發表文吿云、匈總理載萊基最近在羅馬之談話、不過對於義匈兩國建設和平之共同政策、交換意見、第一匈牙利今不在任何列强勢力範圍之內、嗣後凡非經匈牙利同意不得對其作片面之決定、蓋此時期業已過去也、第二、匈牙利無需請求義大利之支持、義匈友誼極為密切、義方甚至將不許足以引起匈牙利向其乞援之局勢發生、義國決無意欲使匈牙利放棄其修改邊疆要求、第三、羅馬方面素知匈牙利之政策為歐洲、係以全歐之利益為目標、故完全得義大利之贊助、第四、義匈會商之唯一目的、即係由兩國共同利益之觀點、硏究世界之局勢、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法土會商　軍事合作　土委員團返京</h3>
<p>羅馬　據安加拉電訊、昨週赴阿里波與協約國各軍事領袖會談之土耳其軍事委員團、現已返抵此間、該委員團領袖為土耳其副參謀長、貢杜齊將軍、所會談之事件、為土英法三國軍隊之調整及其三國協定下之合作問題、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間外交界人士頃談稱、關於巴爾幹半島問題、英法兩國政府當於最短期內進行談話、並擬採取較為强硬的政策、據各方面傳來消息、土耳其對於英法兩國同盟之態度始終如一、毫無疑義、英法兩國倘在巴爾幹半島被迫而有所舉動、土國定必一致行動、此外據此間政界人士所知、英法兩國對德國所實施之封鎖辦法、即將在各方面加緊施行、而不問其後果如何、即與蘇聯引起糾紛亦非所顧云（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>斯丹埠　據此間宣稱、法國防空專家摩倫上將、目前在伊斯米爾、檢閱土耳其軍隊、渠將為斯丹埠改革防空措置、使趨於現代化、（廿七日海通社電）</p>
<h3>蘇立友誼　與日俱進　蘇報著文評論</h3>
<p>莫斯科　尼柯拉耶夫頃在眞理報著文、詳述「今日的立陶宛」、文云、「自蘇聯與立陶宛簽訂互助公約後、蘇聯即將維爾諾城及維蘭諾區交還立國、迄今已六月矣、在此時期中、所有蘇立兩國敵人所散佈之惡毒謠言、巳完令證明不確、彼等陰謀旣被粉碎、現已偃旗息鼓、蘇立互助公約已使立陶宛不致捲入第二次帝國主義戰爭、此公約頗使英法集團感受束縛、否則彼等必早煽動波羅的海國家參加戰爭、（彼等現正在斯堪的那維亞及巴爾幹國家進行同樣煽動工作）、立陶宛領土之完整、目前非特由立國軍隊所維護、且蘇聯亦予以友誼的援助、立國軍隊之實力、現已與日俱進立陶宛指揮人員均能善用蘇聯所給予彼等之軍火及軍火原料之援助、「立陶宛日報」稱、「蘇立互助公約為立陶宛投資增加之決定　素目前立陶宛已成立新的工業與貿業、」凡此種種、均足證明造謠者之無恥、（造謠者屢次企圖使各方懷疑蘇聯與波羅的海國家合作之誠意）蘇聯現已覓得最簡單之方法、使蘇聯與隣近各小國團結一致、此種方法絕未阻碍小國之獨立入自由、吾人敢謂立陶宛已獲得新的生活並在其國史中加入　新的成就、」（二十六八日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫　將訪柏林之迷　傳德蘇預備談話　進行似未見順利</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹　據此間「　聞報」駐柏林訪員聲稱、德蘇新接觸之預備談話進行不利、巳無可諱、其主要障碍、顯係蘇義修好須以蘇聯對土羅兩國保證需基礎之問題、莫斯科似不願在有限之時期內放棄其在巴爾幹之野心、該訪員又稱、納粹報紙之論調已完全改變、上週各報所宣傳德義蘇三國密切合作以創造「新歐洲」之說、今已不可復見、上星期六日德政府發言人尙暗示蘇外長莫洛托夫訪德之期已近、今則於問及此事之時、僅謂蘇聯對於此項訪問巳予否認、柏林方面已注意義方對於德方所宣與柏林羅馬莫斯科三角關係之冷淡，尤其莫羅馬之無綫電訊、否認義國代表團將開始與莫斯科方面談判之謠傳、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>丹麥京城　據此間「國民日報」載稱、蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、將於明日前往柏林、俾就巴爾幹半島局勢、與德國當局進行談話、同時德國方面尙擬米機在義蘇兩國之間從事拉攏、務使羅馬柏林軸心與柏林莫斯科軸心兩項政策並行不悖、甚至能在東南歐洲方面杞與合作、又據消息靈通人士談稱、德國當局刻正努力慫恿蘇聯、保陣羅馬尼亞之領土現狀云、按羅國貝薩拉比亞省原為俄國所有（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　蘇聯駐德大使希克伐爾齊夫、將於週杪自莫期科回抵此間、當希克伐爾齊夫奉召回國之初、曾引起此間外國人士之種種謠言、有謂蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫將前來柏林訪問、同時此開各報咸撰文討論同盟國有意在東南歐擴大戰爭範圍之企圖、以及進攻蘇聯之意、「强硬報」之言有謂、蘇伊兩國簽訂商務條約、乃對英國詭計之新打擊、「柏林夜報」亦謂、英法之新目的乃對蘇聯作戰、德國報紙之態度可以「柏林金融報」為代表、其評論略謂、英國曾公開承認採取各種方法、利用東南歐各國至少可以作為在經濟上　滅德國之手段、倫敦陰謀家對義大利則未加注意、要知義大利一如德國、亦密切注意同盟國欲在東南歐擴大戰事之企圖、總之同盟國之陰謀、猶太新聞記者亞幹在比利時「米特洛波爾報」所作評語極為透澈、其評語略謂、「倘戰事再持續十個月、則中立國得不再存在矣、」（十七日海通電）</p>

<h3>和明商會年會報告　稱中國前途樂觀　日限制第三國貿易如故　長江珠江開放尙無日期</h3>
<p>上海中外人士於困難中勉度一年</p>
<p>字林報云、上海和明商會二十六日在外灘十七號培克洋行舉行年會、主席鮑特威爾向會員致詞、對中國之前途、表示樂觀、並述及去年間外國商業利益所遭遇之無數困難、長江之重行開放、及中國鐵路情勢等事、而對中國人士之復元力與一般商人所表現之勇毅不屈、備加贊揚，</p>
<p>受盡磨綀　稍見好轉</p>
<p>鮑氏演詞略謂、談論商務之前、余願來此機會、代表各會員對波爾遜君因病離滬、面爾本商會主席職、表示扼腕、並祝波君迅復健康、上届年會中、主席曾言及上海及其他通商口岸中外商人對應付種種困難所表現之勇殺不屈、已往十二個月內、若干種困難與限制、稍已寬弛、惟天津·南京·廣州·厦鬥·等地、殆不在此列、余信貿易局勢之好轉、實乃通商口岸中外商人今已在逆境中受盡磨練而將繼續努力、有以致之、</p>
<p>中國戰事影響貿易</p>
<p>貿易與航業、去年漸趨興盛、不意歐戰突起、致在下半年度遭受不利影響、尤以海外航業為最、中國發生戰事、三載於茲、廣大區域、慘遭蹂躪、民衆分散、顚沛流離、鐵路公路及他種交通工具、或損或毀、廣大地區、被日當局所封鎖、不得自由貿易、貨物之出入中國、尙屬可能、然僅往時貿易之一部份而已、吾人將因歐戰而續受損失至何種程度、須侍他日觀之、在華貿易之復趨興盛、似唯中國及歐洲戰事得滿意的結束是賴、當前似有黑暗之時期在焉、</p>
<p>上海前途仍極光明</p>
<p>然渠對上海與中國成為國際商業中一元素之前途、抱有極大信念、所望中國與歐洲戰事、得吿健全之解決、而藉此樹立各國間更自由的金融與經濟上往來、在精衛率領下「新中國」之統一、係頗費猜疑之事、故中國戰事短期內不致吿終、</p>
<p>物價高漲局勢嚴重</p>
<p>已往半年來上海普通日用品與房租等之價格指數令人大為關切、本年一月間、物價指數達三二五·四四、勞工所受影響頗鉅、幸勞工之工資、逐漸調整、並發津貼、故未發生嚴重工潮、然此方面之局勢、不能認為已吿平靜、各有關方面尤其為本市當道務須極審愼注意此種局勢、當道者之迫切任務、端在遏止居奇牟利及抬高物價、今兩租界均已採取　驟以期達此目的、殊可感慰、</p>
<p>海關入超數額驚人</p>
<p>據統計所示、一九二九年間中國海關稅收、約增華幣七千七白萬元、惟此際不能詳確分析數量、就表面觀之、此乃貿易之增進、實則所增者、僅種類有限之輸出入物品、一九三九年海關統計載人超逾三萬萬元、要知入口品乃以余單位照十四便士半官定匯價易成法幣而計値者、若照黑巿　幣匯率計、如出口品然、則入超達二·一九四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>日方限制依然存在</p>
<p>多數通商口岸所受限制依然存在、其中若干口岸因受限制、實使第三國貿易，完全停頓、第三國方面認為貿易及其他商業金融活動所受限制、實非必要、徒使淪陷區之恢復常態與復興工作、受其阻碍、中國民衆購買力、大為减低、尤以一九三九年間為最、</p>
<p>多數鐵路續受統制</p>
<p>日軍在其侵佔各區、賡續搜羅必要產物、以充戰地日軍之給養、並以重要原料、供給在中國及日本國內之日方工業、從外人持有鐵路債劵者之觀點而論、鐵路情勢、未見好轉、而日軍仍禁止持券人行使其視察與管理鐵路財產之權、多數鐵路、續受日人統制、一九二八年間恢復之鐵路商業交通、已見大增、貨客運輸頗盛、惟此等鐵路、乃用仍未淸償之外債所造、今竟載運貨客、而對債券持有人、則絕不償還分文、</p>
<p>長江開放遙遙無期</p>
<p>日政府已允許開放南京以下之長江與珠江、任第三國船隻航行、　開放日期、尙未決定、所望此兩江之開放、不致久延、至就長江而言、本商會願見具交通不久恢復辛漢口、或最少至蕪湖為止、黃浦江與吳淞口之仍不疏濬、令人頗感焦慮、此項問題與各國航業有關、近聞　與本巿日當局商妥恢復黃浦江與吳淞口之疎濬工作、此點頗可滿意、疏濬工作、自一九三七年八月戰事爆發起、即吿停頓、其後殆未一加疏濬、此事對於上海各國人民、關係甚大、切望濬浦局恢復工作、而不復遭受不必要之阻撓與限制，</p>
<p>上海局勢依然混亂</p>
<p>一九三九年間上海所受限制稍　寬弛、惟商業實業與航運要區楊樹浦於年抄仍有困難、且運輸不便、工潮迭起、通行　與宵禁之限制、已於上月撤銷、南市亦於本年初開放、惟他區之限制、依舊未變、西區「歹土」之賡續存在、使公共租界市政當局深為關心、且因「上海市府警局」在該區、包括租界馬路在內、佔得一部份管理權、致困難大增、工部局與、市府代表談判結果、二月十六日簽訂界外馬路區之警務協定、旋工部局總董復與駐滬日總領事、簽訂關於穌州河北區警務之協定、</p>
<p>中國人士復興力量</p>
<p>綜之、上海已在此種情　上、所可期望的最滿意之狀態中度過一九三九年、此大半因中國人士之復元力及一般中外商人在極困難情况下、所表現之勇毅不屈、有以致之、余覺對於前途、頗可樂觀、貿易之早日復趨興盛、人人俱得其和、對於目下各國間缺乏眞正合作、實乃進展與　　之重要障礙一節明瞭愈早、則恢復眞正繫榮之開始亦愈速、</p>
<h3>明日各界下半旗　紀念革命先烈</h3>
<p>明日為黃花崗七十二烈士殉國紀念日、即革命先烈紀念節、並經中央規定、鄧仲元·陳央士·廖仲愷·朱執信·諸先烈殉國、及胡展堂·黃克强·逝世、合併於是日舉行、各界追念諸先烈慷慨殉國、豐功偉績、明日將一律下半旗、並停止娛樂要會、以誌哀思、各學校　江海關等、並循例休假、　因環境特殊、除各學校分別舉行紀念會外不擴大紀念儀式、各界為繼承先烈遺志、拯救國家危難、堅決擁護國策、並勵行節約運動、貢獻力量、以完成抗戰建國大業、本巿廉恥運動會並製定紀念要點、略謂、處於今日環境中、紀念革命先烈、共意義尤為偉大諸先烈均服膺三民主義、追隨總理、矢志革命、與專制　淸相搏鬥、事雖未成、然慷慨赴義之精神、足使中國人民從們怒吼、辛亥革命、卒吿完成、先烈勳業、永垂不朽矣、上海市民、雖因身處孤島、環境特殊、物價高漲、生活艱苦、但較諸前綫之將士、戰地之難民、其甘苦又不可同日而語、祭此紀念先烈之日、應以先烈精神為法、砥礪志節、恪遵廉恥信條、光明前途、日益接近、</p>

<p>八人遺缺不再補充</p>
<p>大陸報云、關于　當局裁减　務處西員八人事、頃據工部局總辦兼總裁費利浦聲稱、被裁八人、不致由他人接替、因工部局任何處均不抱辭退舊員、而麗年輕薪低者接代之政策也、就渠所知、除工務處外、工部局他處不擬立即裁員、惟各處長皆已接令厲行拇節云、</p>

<h3>日出雲艦　昨晨駛往南京</h3>
<p>日海軍第三艦隊旗艦出雲號、於本月十一日午、突然駛出淞口游弋、於十五日返滬、停靠虹口招　局中棧碼頭原址、昨日黎明五時許、忽又起椗出口、溯江而上、據說係赴南京、聞有大批日海軍要人、乘坐該艦赴寗、為祝偽「府」成立、</p>
<h3>法租界平價委會　小組會議</h3>
<p>法租界公董局平準物價委員會、先後於七日十三日舉行兩次會議，審查小組會之　查物報吿、及研究抑平物價辦法大致已決定、並請　滬法總領事鮑黛芝核辦、為（一）向日方交涉發給赴內地之採辦證、（二）組織糧食運銷總機關、（三）向開灤公司交涉、供給熟水業平煤，均巳次第進行、惟以巿塲情形、瞬息萬變、投機操縱之事、須隨時防止、故該會工作、仍不斷積極進步、並繼續進行調查工作、提出研討、該會復於昨日下午二時、在法公董局舉行小組委員會議、先後討論凡二小時、聞會議中曾將巡捕房面所採訪製作之情報提忖審查、決俟公共租界警務處方面之報吿送到、以供參證、再行有所決定、而由兩租界共同實施各種抑平物價、以减輕市民負担與困難之辦法、</p>
<h3>中國人士　吸收精神食糧　中國各地於去年一年之內　銷去聖經廿二萬四千餘册</h3>
<p>字林西報載稱據中國聖經公會、英國聖經公會及美國聖經公會年報（一九三九年十二月三十一日為止）所載、中國各地去年一年內所銷聖經及新約舊約、共達二十二萬四千二百八十二冊之新紀錄、校之十年前、計增加百分之一百七十五，較之一九三八年亦增加百分之五十九、去年十二月間、已訂購之聖經及新舊約約三萬五千册、因紙張市價飛漲、臨時取銷者、尙未計算在內、中國人民在此米珠薪桂艱苦奮鬥時期、仍能然忱吸收精神的食糧實屬難能可貴、史家恒　、聖經與歐美各國民族歷史、業已打成一片、據中國各省分會報吿、中國學生現多愛讀聖經、此種情形、在自由的中國尤甚、言念及此、吾人因乃發問曰、中日戰爭，　　以聖經　中國人生活、打成一片乎、</p>
<h3>日軍藉槍刺徵稅　造成高昂物價　日軍允消除內地貨物捐稅　果守諾言則貨價或可降低</h3>
<p>大陸報云、頃據消息靈通方面聲稱、日軍苟守諾言、而撤銷對內地運滬各種產物所加之限制與捐稅、則本由物價高漲之解決辦法在望矣、本巿日當局發此諾言、縱具誠意、但能否在短期間使之實行、尙屬可疑、蓋</p>
<p>僻遠區域駐軍仍隨意行動也、工部局平價委員會近與本巿日軍當局商談、後者曾兀盡其所能、消除對內地運滬產物所徵種種捐稅、至是、日軍方面乃首次正式承認對運滬土產、確加限制、蓋日軍方面已往談及限制事、必力加否認者也、日軍藉槍刺</p>
<p>徵取捐稅常有「索詐」情事、此即本市物價奇昂之主因、此種非法限制、非經撤銷、則物價不能低落種種捐稅，旣係低級官佐與哨兵私自勒索、則上峯命令對於絕滅勒索行動、似未必有何大效、欲求其生效、務須盡力厲行命令、日當局將否發此命令、殊屬可疑、因日當局徵取捐稅、收入甚豐也、</p>
<h3>布特烈克　代理美領</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃悉前駐滬美總領事高斯旣被委任美國駐澳第一任公使職、本市美總領署一切事務，從六日起、暫由該署執行官布特烈克代理、至新任駐滬美總領事從美國抵此為止、惟新總領事職、究將委何人担任、尙無消息按布特烈克前在美京遠東事務科供職、旋來漢口與上海兩地美總領署任執行官、各已八年、</p>
<h3>國內郵資增價　暫不實行</h3>
<p>國內郵資增加事件、據大通社記者向上海郵政管理局探悉、該局迄昨日止、尙未奉到昆明郵政總局命令、惟此事遲早必須實行、至四月一日實行之說、顯已不及、又該局此次招考之郵務佐、因許女性參加、故報名者倍見踴躍、是批郵務佐錄取後、將即派赴蘇浙皖區郵局、</p>
<h3>工部局當選美董　阿樂滿之談話　處理局務不存偏私　麥氏落選態度坦曰</h3>
<p>現任申報總主筆工部局初選當選　董美僑阿樂滿氏、頃發表談話云、關於余對工部局政務方面之意見、深恐不能多所奉吿、因現在余對於該項事務之詳細情形、所知甚少、但余得以</p>
<p>虛心態度為工部局服務、決不存絲毫之偏見、又阿氏對於初選之成功、並不表示驚異、稱此多少乃預期中之事、前日之投票選舉、於十午五時完畢、六時廿分，已將結果公布、唱票者三人、工作迅速、一方面保持工作之秘密性，同時對於防止用不誠實手腕投進之票、尤為努力、故成績</p>
<p>異黨美滿選舉結果揭曉後、所有之選舉票、即在美僑聯合會當華盛頓總統照片之前、付之一炬、投入之選舉票、皆封在有記數之信封內、然後投入密封之小箱中、當衆開票之前、首將信封上之數字與存底核對，以防有一票兩投之弊發生、唱者唱</p>
<p>二個信封上之數目後、即將存底上之　字取消之、然後繼續讀下、其手續至為周密云、至麥唐納氏落選、其個人並不因此表示不愉、據麥氏昨日吿記者稱、在三候選人中、選舉兩席、當然有一人落選、記者詢以是否感覺任何遺憾、麥氏答絕無、工部局董事為一煩重之職務、余不當選、又有何憾</p>
<h3>麺粉再度平售　價格尙未商妥　廠方核計每包須十三元　切麺業主張每包十二元　集團訂米即可出棧米價看跌</h3>
<p>民食調節協會為籌集墊款、提取洋米事、昨日下午　時、在香港　五十九號會所、召開司庫聯席會議、到李文杰·奚玉書·陸高誼·胡詠麒·陳　生　、據平明社記者悉、該會當局、日來　私人信用借款方式、已籌集　十餘萬元、其中由該會主席虞洽卿認借五萬元、該會常務理事郭順認借六萬元、其餘之數、認借者亦甚為踴躍、故該項墊款、為數雖達百萬元之鉅、而在負責當局，積極籌劃下、不難於最短　期間如數籌足、屆時存棧洋米、陸續出淸、以調　民食、滬市米價、可望繼續下跌、</p>
<p>平麺價格尙未洽妥昨日下午一時、切麺業推派代表王錦文·王福新·朱振芳·藏國風·李邦琨等五人、偕赴工部局謁見何副總辦、當由何氏接見、報吿與廠方磋商平售麵粉經過、據稱、廠方因成本關係、堅持每包十三元之數目、各代表以外間　回籠粉亦僅十三元二角餘一包、今平價麵粉價格、與市價僅有毫末之差、殊失平價意義、當請求平價麵粉以十二元為限、何氏以民食攸關、常即以十二元一包價格、再向廠方進行接洽，故昨日答覆、未有結果、</p>
<p>平賣辦法頗多建議自米糧價格暴漲後、麵粉已成全市數　萬平民之主要食糧、食麵　較食米簡便、　　角以上、即可購買、故解決本巿民食問題、實以平賣麵粉為最迫切之途、平賣麵粉曾於上月舉辦、然因購買以一包為最少單位、致使一般平民、仍未能受其普遍之忠、在此木價未平、麵粉價格又復高昂　之時、社會人士有鑒於民食前途之未現坦途、頗多建議、請求當局再次舉行平賣麵粉　　辦法為將四號麵粉每包分裝四小袋、其價格亦以每包之四分之一計算、如此則貧民可有購買能力、而平賣遂可收普遍之效果、</p>
<h3>滬市　人口稅减　總數不足四百萬　貨物供應漸平衡</h3>
<p>當中日戰事發生後、內地民衆、均紛紛避滬居住、最多時、人口總數、計達五百五十餘萬、近以物價不斷騰漲、日常生活所需、已激增數倍、故內地來滬者、均已紛紛歸返原籟、據調查統計、最近因民衆返籟、故滬巿人口、已降至三百八九十萬人、因此各項貨物供應、已漸呈平衡、投機之風或可戢止、</p>

<h3>七月一日起　開征遺產稅　徵收機關設評價委員會　暫委所得稅事務所辦理</h3>
<p>遺產稅為直　稅體系中之重要骨幹，創辦之議、追溯於民國四年、今遺產稅暫行條例及施行條例、業經國民政府先後公佈、準七月一日起、全國一致施行、至於徵收所應用一切表　均已議定、各地設立遺產評價委員會、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>免徵數目塡表須知</p>
<p>遺產稅暫行條例規定、凡人於死亡時、在中國領域內遺有財產者、依照條例、徵遺產稅、中華民國人民、在本國領域內有住所、而在國外有遺產者、亦應徵稅、遺產稅以遺產繼承人及受遺贈人為納稅義務　、遺產總領未滿五千　者、得　納遺產稅、被繼承人應依規定格式、塡字報吿表、表明（一）被繼承人之姓名住所、（二）繼承開始地、（三）繼承開始日、　上次繼承之年月日、（五）主要遺產之約計數、及其所在地、（六）　繼承人在繼承開始前三年內、就其財產為分析或贈與時、其財產價額及財產繼承人或受贈人之姓名住址、（七）報吿人之姓名住址、無住所者其居所、報吿人為遺產管理人或其居所、報告人為遺產管理人或遺漏執行人時、　應載明其就職日期、及納稅義務人之姓名住所、</p>
<p>設置評價委會辦理</p>
<p>關於遺產稅之徵收、暫委託所得稅事務所辦理之、各地遺產稅徵收機關、設置遺產評價委員會、該委員會設委員五人至七人、除遺產稅徵收機關代表一人、為當然委員外、由財政部就當地左列人選中聘任之、（一）可法機關、（二）地政或民政機關、（三）敎育或文化機關、（四）地方財政機關、（五）地方自治機關或團體、（六）地方公正人士、評價委員為無給職、任期三年、評價委員不得參加本人或本人配偶五觀等內血親、三親等內姻親、繼承遺產之評價、遺產稅徵收及評價人員、對於遺產之總類數額及其有關文件、應負保守秘密之責、違者依刑法第三百十八條妨害秘密罪論處、</p>
<p>五千元起一律徵稅　遺產總額在五千元以上者、一律徵稅百分之一、遺產總額超過五萬元者、就具超過、依左列稅率、按級計算加徵之、（一）超過五萬元至十萬元者、就具超過額徵百分之一、（二）超過十萬元至二十五萬元者、就具超過額徵百分之二、（三）超過二十五萬元至五十萬元者、為百分之三、（四）超過五十萬至七十五萬元者、為百分之四、（五）超過七十五萬元至一百萬者、為百分之五、（六）超過一百萬元至一百五十萬者、為百分之七、（七）超過一百五十萬元至二百萬元者、為百分之九、（八）超過二百萬元至三百萬元者、為百分之十二、（九）超過三百萬至四百萬元者、為百分之十五、以後超過一百萬元、加徵百分之五、超過一千萬元者、就其超過額徵百分之五十、</p>
<h3>匯市波動原因　江海關貿易入超趨增　今後變化尚未能臆測</h3>
<p>自耶穌復活節開始后、金價暴騰、外匯見縮　與侖歷　年　開盤時情形相仿、茲經大中社記者禍查、此次金價騰貴、英鎊至跌落、及投機份子之操縱固為一因、而貿易及政局、亦有聯帶關係、最近滬關對外貿易、表面數宗為出超、（海關計算進口國幣價値、用中央銀行之掛牌金單位合國幣折合率計算、與實際公開市塲之正式買賣滙率、相差甚遠、）實際上均為入超但較去年改善甚多、如今年一月、</p>
<p>滬關入超　僅合美金九萬餘元、治至二月、生絲與英法銷路減少、棉紗棉布之印度市塲、亦受打擊、出口衰退、而進口貨物、如棉花米煤等、均見增加、故二月份滬關貿易、據傳實際入超六百二十萬美金、在匯市杌隉不安之下、此種貿易相差之趨勢當然足使滙率趨於荏弱、最近南京偽「政權」成立、企圖　行鈔劵、擾亂法幣、淺見者不免受其影響、但據又一消息、</p>
<p>滬市美金　票、估計約有三千萬元、當然供過於求、其所以行情堅挺者、不外投機操縱、把持市面、至傳偽「政權」對金融界之關係、商界方面、看法並不一致、甚有視為法幣將趨好轉者、故今後匯市之變化、未能臆測也、</p>
<h3>支票簿短少一紙　行員涉嫌受鞫　事後發覺該票巳被兌現　陳仁灝被捕諭傳證再訊</h3>
<p>北京路浙江興業銀行、於去年十二月三十日有康腦脫路二百七十號裕昌隆號前來開立以往來戶、但該號於領得支票後、發覺內中短少八五三〇六九號支票一紙、當向該行掛失、乃至本年二月七日、浙江興業銀行山票據交換所收來票據一千餘紙、　是日適為</p>
<p>廢暦年終　賬務異常忙碌、當時即由行員將收來票據分門別類、發交各管科核對後、然後再送交至會計科、而會計科於當日並未將總數檢點、惟廢暦新春該行循例修業四天、及至二月十二日開業、會計科方發覺內中短少支票一紙、計款二萬七千元、經詳查結果、知該票即屬裕昌隆之</p>
<p>遺失支票　由浙江實業銀行交來、浙江實業銀行係由存戶新泰合記號存入者、及浙江興業　行於二月十四日通知浙實止付時、該二萬七千元巳由新泰於二月十二日十三日兩天支去、若浙江實止付、則此款即不為新泰所支去、事後浙江興業即報吿總巡捕房、經華探長楊培生調查之下、知所謂新泰合記號者、</p>
<p>並無此號　而為虛造、顯屬係一有組織之事件、後經核對筆　之結果、以該行活存部印鑑核對員陳仁灝之筆跡、與新泰合記所開支票略有相似、遂疑係陳所為、將其拘捕、解送特一法院、諭准交八千元保改期在案、此案昨日田錢鴻業刑庭長開一庭審即、捕房律師汝葆彝依偽造文書及詐欺最起訴、浙江興業銀行亦延唐鳴時律師附帶民訴、陳仁灝則延王耀堂律師辯護、其</p>
<p>要旨筆跡　在我國摩臨一種碑帖者、大致有一部相同、尤以鋼筆為最、而此事須經多人之手、非一人所能獨為、而二月七日所發生之事件、竟延至十四日方發覺、乃款巳於發覺前提去、以被吿一職員之地位、焉能有此手腕、且被吿服務巳十餘載、從無過失等等、錢庭長當向各有關證人訊問一過、以尙須調查、諭令改期再訊、</p>

<h3>金融　美英滙兌　暴跌一角四分餘　滬市美滙創最緊紀錄　期現拔開幾達三七五</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、因受海外滙兌美對英竟又暴跌一角四分八七五之影響、故本市滙豐美滙掛牌、遂吿縮小一二五、荷呂日滙亦報跟縮、他如英滙等則均平定、至內盤情况、先緊後回、變動空前、以晨初美英滙兌之繼續在跌、竟出一般經營者之預料、致開後呈英平美縮、美滙立見六元〇六二五、此價實巳打破去年八月十一日之六元一八七五、最緊紀錄、但僅曇花一現、而四月期美滙勢尤緊俏、開時曾討價至五元六八七五、與現貨拔開幾有三七五、惟有行無巿、（假若依此價套利、則可得六分七厘之鉅）、但因投機家之突塞於先、市象無形中回硬、兼外行賣意較前為殷、而人心皆以滙兌可有回升、是故潛勢漸鬆、且外行及投機商等拋售終未止步、時四月份美滙巳至六元、英金亦吿四辦士矣、而現貨美滙六元一八七五、頗易購結、如是迨至午刻、遂於平靜中收盤、結果英平美緊〇三一二五、本日套做者頗不乏人、合利約三分一厘至二分六厘之間、</p>
<p>今日滙兌將看漲</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期跌六二五、遠期縮五六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬法等各滙供平、美對英猛落一角四分八七五、對滬降一角、對法暴跌八分六二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元〇六二五、較隔昨晚收英平美緊一二五、乃滙兌又跌所致、同時四月期美滙竟索價五元六八七五、與現貨拔開、計有三七五之多、開後投機家首吐、市面即吿回鬆、計外行吸進投機商四月份美滙五元八一二五、及八七五、以後外行亦賣予沙遜四月份英金三辦士九三七五與九六八七五對搭、未幾滙豐掛牌揭曉、英平美縮三一二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉小三分有半、此後投機商對滙兌均轉看長、是以進英塞美居多、潛勢續鬆、計投機商賣予外行四月份美滙田五元九三七五至六元、而外行大通某行暨滙豐等塞予投機商四月份英金四辦士、斯時現貨美滙六元一八七五、一度可結、午刻滙豐忽乘機吸進、是以狀態漸定、計曾吃進投機商本月期美滙六元一二五延至午收、英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元一五六二五、本月份英令四辦士一〇九三七五、美滙六元一二五、四月份英金四辦士、美滙五元九三七五、結果比上日現貨英平美續緊〇三一二五、本月份英鬆〇四六八七五、美軟〇三一二五、四月份英長〇七八一二五、美賤〇三一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<h3>黑市美滙大緊　黃金漲後忽起反動　高峯雖見五千四百五十元　多頭已無力再戀獲利轉賣</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤巿况、雖收盤價反較隔咋撳低十二元、但初時之飛黃騰達、漫無止境、迭創金價新紀錄、最高峯為五千四百五十元、蓋晨開以美英匯兌又吿大跌、美匯近遠期一致走緊、人心熱烈異常、金號猛扒、即跳七十元、為五千四百四十元、未幾錢兌業雖售出若干、曾微落二十五元、但反增此後買風之盛、金號等咸入巿搜購、霎時籌碼不敷搶奪、遂見五千四百五十元、豈知塲內傳外行如匯豐等、將拒絕新做黃金押款、並加速催贖巳貸之款、致影響一般買賣、而關係者當更急急脫手不再猶豫、而獲利散戶高價出籠、本所樂為、不久即挫落甚厲、再以收盤前人心對匯巿看長、結果倒小十二元、為五千三百五十八元、亦屬罕見、午後因上午交易旺盛、（約四千兩之上）淸理費時、乃同業決定特例停市、聞塲外未有做開、價亦鮮乏變動、銀樓飾金二度曾創五百四十五元之最高價、但終則回平、與上日未分榮辱、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤反小十二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開匯兌報縮一角有餘、黑市美匯奇緊、人心再挺、一片喊買聲、開巿即狂抬七十元、金號進銀號五十兩、為五千四百四十元、嗣有錢兌業多頭吐出、立回二十五元、現金號出銀號五十兩、為五千四百十五元、顧以某金號再來狂撈、復漲起三十五元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、為五千四百五十元、此後外匯轉硬、並聞匯豐等外銀行催贖押款、人心立轉向下、浮多羣起出籠、更加大戶誰券帮錢兌業等貸款貨傾向吐出、不久遂暴落一百元、現金號出銀號五十兩、為五千三百五十元、　銀號忽乘機猛拖、同時金號錢兌業亦互相　入、重又抬起七十元、銀號　錢兌業五十兩、為五千四百二十元、卒因外匯仍報回鬆、買戶跟風吸牧者更少、反之獲利售出者愈多，終又回落六十五元、銀號出錢兌業五十兩、為五千三白五十五元、繼之銀號互做五十兩為五千三百五十八元作午收價、結果比上日回落十二元、半天一百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金漲後回平</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初開大同行仍懸五百四十元、迨至九時半掛大五元、十時二十分回小五元、十一時光景後掛高五元、正午十二時重見回低五元、此後無變化、結果平平、大同行依然懸五百四十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>美鈔兔起鶻落　全日高低差五角</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、變幻莫測、初因鎊價繼續慘落、致黑市美匯竟打破去年八月十一日之頂緊價、而再發現六元零六二五之空前新緊價、因此美金票驟然昂達十六元六角、後以一般咸看今日鎊價將有轉機、投機商紛爭傾吐美匯、致美金票亦跟隨回落、午間降為十六元一角二分、午後更降至十六元一角、英金票先跌後回平、英美金鎊先隨金價猛漲、繼亦隨之下落、香港票跟港匯稍疲、新加坡票及坎拿大票羅比票等供給不弱、荷蘭票因匯豐掛牌又縮二分之一而趨堅、日金票供給仍夥、晚巿退為一元三角零六厘、朝鮮票趨勢仍堅、晚巿為一元、昨日市價、計英美金鎊各跌五角、美金票降五分、香港票低一分、新加坡及坎拿大票均跌二角、羅比票落一角半、荷蘭票則漲一角、餘俱不秀、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米一氣漲兩元餘　無錫米市要看日人動靜　上海洋米又回漲六七元　澳麥將有九萬餘包到滬</h3>
<p>米市自此週內反跌為漲後、無日不在上漲　、昨又續現驚人之漲風、各色洋米價、悉增二元有奇、雖千市又稍回、然較之前週　低時三十七八元之價、此週之內、一漲又達六七元之巨、可見通來米價之變化劇烈、查此次米價復漲之由、實緣本月之大批期貨自小絕湧釗後、巳將解滿、所以洋米來源突吿　稀、雖下月份期貨（即四月份）出月又將運出、然最速尙須一旬之久、而為數又不及本月分之牛、僅二十餘萬包、且後五月份聞未續訂、故後批到貨已可握算、致所有現貨貨主、遂無意速脫、今時行客方面手中所存之貨、在前關暴跌時恐遭受大虧、悉巳削脫、而店舖所備以曩者市面一再下游、出多進少、店存亦枯、售者不脫、購者思進、成目下之回風、是以昨晨既被此　環境所驅、初開即見本鄉店胃互出問津、羣相競搜、而在客販扳俏之下、巿面立升一元、一號西貢售四十二元半、其後更有內地客帮相繼大進、形勢益俏、喊聲隆隆迭起、市面步升、迨中巿各貨行情、似拾級登階、增至二元半光景、一號西貢巳售四十四元、二號四十元零五角、火絞米四十二元、特微黨四十三元、小絞三十九元七角、二號退維四十元、東京砶尖四十元、經此高峯、未免一轟太過、銷塲漸懈、迄午巿各色洋米價又稍回貶半元、較之前市實加二元左右耳、餘如粳糯國米、到貨由虹口轉出旣寥、祇一千餘包、去路亦佳、市價並廾元外、聞厚薄粳塲外暗盤、崑錫粳四十六七元、靑泗特薄四十六元、大市四十五元、南港早晚稻四十四五元、</p>
<p>洋米承前日回振之漲風、價飛漲、後定難以接近、且華洋價飛漲、後定難以接近、且華洋商定成手貨亦乏續脫、隨多扳俏不肯輕脫、現西貢一號自四十二元一路上抬昂至四十四元、比之前日較漲二元半左右、其他各米粉紛跟起較大元外及二三元不等、回籠期貨原包批價亦被提高元外、一號西貢初開五十元零五角、旋至五十一元、二號目四十八元至四十八元半、米菉自四十四元至四十四元三角、但至午後浮散客囤趁高塞出、回籠原包二號首先跌落半元、其他各米亦被喊低五六角至一元不等、實緣目下洋米存底充塞、新到小絕、國米開放復見傳說、業內外人心固未安定也、惟昨日交易頗佳、現米開出八千多包、期七百餘噸云、</p>
<p>無錫皎近米市、自平米停售、來源頗湧、貨主心思轉堅、大都目行上棧、待價而沽、巿上稍進日商包胃、以及引起少數行廠囤戶、絡續收買、納胃甚濃、致成求過於供、米稻巿價帶緊、高白粳每石由二十五元三五角、漲至二十六元三五角、二十六日市價、巳至二十七元左右、三日來回昂一元之多、糙粳已至二十五元外、粳稻復至十三元、其情勢全視日商包胃為轉移、如果繼續不斷、不久又至三十元之高價也、</p>
<p>大量洋米今日可到、渣華公司經理之aagen薩傑（譯音）號、自仰光裝米三萬五千包來滬等情、巳誌前報、該輪原定昨日到滬、後改明日（二十九日）抵埠、現悉今晨已可進口、預定停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、今日有洋米四千包、苞米五千餘包運往烟台、又聞大枇澳麥將到滬、係裝恰和洋行外洋船頭部、經理之Bellng倍林（譯音）號輪、計有九千二百噸、約合九萬二千餘包之鉅、據聞係裝散艙、並非包子、大約下月初即可抵滬、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉麥一致轉穩　錫邑麥粉報漲</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨巿漸吿平穩、查二號粉廠盤、站定十三元八角、恐一時未必更動、各廠售意尙佳、故綠砲車牌等客盤、仍有十五元之高峯、但客胃平淡、成交不多、回籠粉老車牌做開十三元六角六分、比前已稍帶緊、良以金貴匯縮之環境中、執貨者均有扳持之意、故巿面恐尙有一度醞釀也、</p>
<p>小麥　巿面亦吿平穩、蓋以連日金漲滙縮、洋麥定價合高、貨方均有提升之意、惟各廠進胃平常、客囤亦鮮問津、故市面一度擯局、聞後巿做開蘇常等麥千餘包、售價尙鮮重大變化云、</p>
<p>無錫　小麥存積枯薄、到源寥寥、巳成尾聲、近曾一度跌至三十二元三五角、前日巿　樣包稀少、每包漲起一元零、粉廠與散戶做至三十四元大關、麵粉前數日每包小至十一元七八角、有上海帮散客動辦、漲至十二元三四角、期粉已到十二元六七角、較前回漲五六角、（知）</p>
<h3>證劵　怡和股息　出人意料　內債復紛紛活躍</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日巿况漲勢加勁、因此頗有附會之謠詞、按之實際、完全因補空而抬高一部份、更以丙種抽籤漸近、未敢冒險而牧回、所謂發行金庫劵與公債有利之說、實屬無精、在目下金子外匯在漲高潮中、加以環境謠言愈益加熾、公債有此意外之漲風、不免為空方造機會耳、昨日上午、聯和繼續補空、昌記買進亦頗踴躣、十四及四十一號以及　大均有進胃、或補空、或搜購、雖在久豐恒泰五源永康等不斷賣出之下、丙種復穿出九元關、午後聯益續有抵補、五源又復收回、同順天生聯益等均有買進、興元義泰同康等物有賣出、市價冉漲、戊種亦穿出九元關、結果比前日又漲三角至六角、成交約一百十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交天原造酸廠五百股、價為五十元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、將近收盤、因聞怡和紗廠股宣布上届末期股息四元（合前次所發中期股息一元計共五元）、羣衆興趣幾俱集中是點、而有忽視其他之概、此項股息、超越一般人臆測、故該股瞬即見昂、自四十四元二五之價升達四十五元半、雖其間獲利了結者亦大有人在、價格終於站住、但因時間短促、公衆顯無暇晷估計是項利息對於股票之眞正價値，否則其活躍力當不止此、一般市况寗靜、價格穩定、中國墾植股趨勢活潑、經營者對此亦正加意深思、橡皮股岑寂、蘭格志較有做開、</p>
<h3>紗花　粗紗春銷開展</h3>
<p>現紗晨開、因英美滙兌狂縮、人心熱烈、二十支雙馬紗本月價為一千零三十八元、四月份價為一千零五十元、直漲至一千零六十元、中途因在此數天中巳漲不少、引起獲利者出籠、又復回小十餘元、但業外吸收之額仍不願放棄也、查半日間成交統計二千五百六十三包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲二十一元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、同行　二、〇六〇　香港　四八　內地　一二〇　統計　二、　六</p>
<h3>花價亦漲二元</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉續活潑、因紗巿良好、及外滙猛縮、同行心思略堅、無奈銀根緊迫、棉巿不能隨紗巿大漲也、廠方亦不大辦、不過有一部份廠方與花號掉換紗花、所以巿上成交不報吿矣、花價比上日漲一二元不等、茲將現棉情形列左、通打包　二一四·〇〇　二一三·〇〇　同行進三一五件北太　二一二·〇〇　新生進五〇〇包草包　一九六·五〇　同行進一八七包火打包　二〇四·二〇　同行進一八七件平果爾　一八七·〇〇　同行進一〇〇件通打包　二一三·〇〇　二一二·〇〇　誠孚進二〇〇件海火機　二〇七·〇〇　同行進一〇〇件東溝打包　二〇四·〇〇　同行進一一九件北太　二一〇·〇〇　同行進四〇〇包大中華　二二八·〇〇　同行進一二〇包</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉巿，昨晨開盤即因利物浦來電報跌而軟、後再因南方帮之在市套賣及海外棉商之賣出而續跌、結果收盤價格、近期跌十三四磅音、遠期跌二十磅音、印度棉市昨日又跌、連同預測降六羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>市况彙誌</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆巿面、照交易狀况尙看活絡、故大局雖平定、但其價格巳在暗鬆不少、昨高豆有厦門帮榨油廠等問津、致行情守住原盤、中次貨不免受殺、比較上日續跌五六角、做開南京豆一百五十包、價為二十元、蚌埠豆三車、價為二十三元至二十二元八角、安慶豆一百三十包、價為二十二元五角、蕪湖豆八百餘包、價自二十四元至二十一元云、</p>
<p>昨日油市依然不振、行情續跌二元半、總之產地價格降落、且本埠存積頗厚、致人心下游、市塲中交易範圍狹小、因之難以引起興趣、統巿祇成交大連豆油二百五十桶、價一百十元至一百零九元五角、江北豆油二十桶、價為一百零七元五角、烟歧豆油三百件、價七十六元、</p>

<p>夫神道遠，人道邇，旱至數年，社稷之神，固元靈應，不必禱祀而求之，而祈之於關帝廟，殆謂神大者德亦大，能回大心以救斯民乎。然晋民而不應盡死也，雨澤之降，固不在禱而得之；晋民而命應絕也，雖關帝其奚能為哉。以關帝之聖，能贊天地化育，果為晋民，則當先召雨師，渥施闓澤，俾春麥先有收成，乃必待祈之而後有雨，是豈將藉神靈而博匾額之榮乎，其誣益甚！夫天體淸虛，地球轉動，雨暘風露，皆氣為之，天本無意於成災，神即無功於降雨。特天時根於人事，和氣致祥之說，或有可憑；但使上有善政，下有善俗，和氣所感，十雨五風，應候而至，故恃神道而說不可通，賴人為而理有一定也。伯撫持　入山右時，災象已成，挽回不及，及乎今日，原來各官，尚不知引咎自責，猶有侵挪賑款，肥家潤身者，則平日之政教號令，慨可知矣。以人為不善而降天為，乃為神道有知而降甘雨，蓋藉口於神，而所以成災之故，亦可委諸天變也。雖然；民多庸愚，為上者假神貺以惑之，使其畏天威而勉為善良，亦為政之微權也。特在上之人，不可全委諸神，而自寬其咎戾耳。縱論及之，非敢以神道為虛無，事神為謬妄，茍細參其理，亦當識余言之不為立異矣。</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>新的家庭</h3>
<p>— 德父</p>
<p>家庭是人類最早的一種社會組織。是根據人類基本的和共同的需要而自然產生的。後來禮敎和法律對於家庭之尊重，也不過對於一種具有極大勢力的事實加以正式承認罷了。因為家庭原不待人為的助力而後出現的。</p>
<p>家庭的關係除了極少數不幸者之外，簡直是人人生命中所必經的階段。假如有人，自幼便喪父母，又沒有兄弟，成年又不婚嫁，他就完全沒有享過家庭的幸福，那眞是人生的一大憾事。倘然有人經過了家庭的階段而不知從家庭裏取得應有的快樂，那便算是人生的一幕慘劇了。</p>
<p>現在大家族制度因為社會環境之變遷，已日漸崩潰。凡居留於都市的靑年，幾無不實行小家庭的生活。於是社會中就發生了一種很普遍的錯誤見解，以為小家庭的中心在夫婦。其實不然，家庭無論大小新舊，都應以兒童為中心，夫婦僅是家庭之出發點。假如我們不認定這個目標，便容易流入自私的一途。不但忽略了家庭最高的任務，也許失掉了家庭的快樂。華爾德立門（Walter　Lippman）說得好：「夫婦兩人的相愛，若非於相愛之外，能共同愛及許多別事，」是不能持久的。換一句話說，夫婦間之愛情是靠共同興趣而維繫的。大約這樣共同興趣愈多愈好。其中最大的共同興趣就是父母愛干之心，兒女的天眞純潔，給父母不少精神上的快慰。甚至有行將破裂的家庭，也靠兒女的可愛而維繫着。那末，兒女眞不愧為小家庭的中心了。</p>
<p>以兒童為中心的家庭，第一任務，在使兒童得着愛情的經驗。做父母的首先要相敬相愛。縱有時彼此意見不同，也不要在兒女面前發生衝突。務使兒童從父母的行為得着相愛的榜樣。其次做父母的—尤其是父親—須抽出一定時間直接給與兒女。在這時間之內，可以參加他們各方向的生活。對於游戲·念書·交友各種關係，都可以作他們密切的伴侶，而不致有絲毫的隔膜，此外對於兒女切勿輕於責駡。縱有過失，也不可在人前施行徽戒，而傷其自重之心。祇可於自己怒氣巳消之時以鎭靜的態度說明其錯誤之處，而加以吿誡。</p>
<p>兒童雖佔了家庭的中心位置，却不能認為家庭的最後目的。家庭的最後目的是做成一個民主社會的雛形，實施民主的公民訓練。我們如認民主是世界應走的途徑，便要從家庭入手。下列幾條是很値得為父母者的注意的：</p>
<p>（一）家庭中的道德標準，父母子女眞共同遵守，切不可發生兩重標準。兒童旣不可吸烟喝酒，成人自當先戒。我們希望兒童守信，自己首先不要失信。換言之，為父母者總要以身作則。所謂「其身正，不令而從。其身不正，雖令不從」。</p>
<p>（二）家庭中對於男女的待遇，應秉平等的精神。切戒重男輕女的惡習。</p>
<p>（三）家庭的工作宜按照兒童的能力使之自幼分任。這樣辦法，一則可使兒童認識工作神聖的意義，二則可以訓練分工合作的能力。這兩層都與兒童將來加入較大的社會時有密切的關係。</p>
<p>（四）家庭如僱用僕婢，父母兒女都應當善待他們，並且感激他們的助力。旣不要任意呼喝，怒罵，還要設法使之上進，而得較為美滿的生活。這樣可以使兒童對於勞工，自少養成正當的態度，和發生正當的關係。</p>
<p>（五）兒童的智力發展到相當程度時，宜設法使他們參與家政會議。大者如家庭預算兒童入學等問題。小者關於寢食時間和客廳陳設等問題。對於兒童在在可以訓練他們，使他們發生一種合理的見解，和增加他們合作的能力。（却酬）</p>

<h3>敎師</h3>
<p>— 小郁</p>
<p>「敎師給我們的只是指示，其成就却還在自己。」所以學生指摘的目標，不應是敎師而是自己，敎師的學問和品行，更不必斤斤計較。對任何人都能了解是最好的學問！</p>
<p>履歷不過是經騐的一部分，擁有較高地位的人，並不就是最有學問的人。認眞敎授的人，才是好的敎師！表現學問的方式，不只是口述。獲得學問的方式，也不只是「聽」！</p>
<p>敎師的主張和學問，不一定是自己所能接收的，盲從的結果是失敗，但自己的思想中也儘可以攙入別人的意見，共同的見解經過互相的討論可以發揚光大。</p>
<p>敎師能帮助你獲得學問，能發掘你隱藏的天才，但並不能液輸學問給你，或是將你重新創造！</p>
<p>敎師是別人，你是自己！</p>

<h3>戰前贈言</h3>
<p>— Breekenridge著　品品譯</p>
<p>——個隨軍敎士的敎言</p>
<p>士兵們與同胞們：今夜怕是我們最後一次會面了。我們一同進軍，我們一起受到交戰時的危險，撤兵時的煩惱；我們同樣忍受艱難與飢餓，內奸的搗亂，外敵的壓迫。我們夜夜坐在同一的營火旁，吃一樣的乾糧；我們一齊聽到起身號而我們努力，聽到歸營號而辛苦的士兵們憇息，以大地為床，軍囊為枕。</p>
<p>現在呢，士兵們與弟兄們，我們相見了，在這平靜的山谷裏，在戰鬥的前夜，陽光正從那邊山後暗去，就是那陽光，明晨將在血海上閃爍的啊。</p>
<p>我們的國土只有一天能這樣的躺在平和的陽光裏啊！綠色的林子是那樣靜寂，祖輩的小屋胃着靑的炊烟，金色的麥田點綴了四周的荒蕪，人聲的悅耳音樂驚醒森林的沉靜。如今，仁愛的上帝呀，看這變化吧！藉着沒有理由的托詞，假胃上帝的聖名，要求救主的帮助，那異族在殺戮我們的人民了！他們掠奪我們的城市，他們毀滅我們的田野，現在他們正在這幽靜的谷外包圍我們的營地。</p>
<p>我知道你們能得到上帝的保佑而强壯起來。明天你們參加戰鬥時將安心決意。在戰鬥的時辰，四周將昏黑，只有瀰漫的砲火與兇暴的槍火閃閃發光，死者將縱橫你們的脚下。記住吧，士兵們，上帝是同你們在一起的，永生的上帝助你們戰；彼駕在戰雲上，彼驅戰士衝上風暴的搏鬥。可畏的上帝，無敵的上帝，助你們戰，你們將勝利。</p>
<p>「仗劍者亡於劍」</p>
<p>你們也執劍，但你們的心不是為覇道與橫行。你們執劍是為了你們的家，你們的奏，你們的孩兒。你們執劍是為了眞理，正義，公道；你們必能有歡欣的報答。你們的敵人執劍是為了破壞人的愛物，褻凟上帝；他們必亡於劍。</p>
<p>現在，弟兄們與士兵們，我要向你們道別了。我們有許多人將於明天殉戰——上帝其安死者之魂兮！——我們有許多人或活下去講述明天戰鬥的故事，記憶裏諒會寄留着今日的秋夜。我們再見時，其願黃昏的夕影照射了一片自由的地土。</p>
<p>上帝在天佑其勝利！</p>
<p>（一七七七年九月十日美獨立戰爭時）</p>

<h3>偉大的友情</h3>
<p>— 劉導鴻</p>
<p>偉大眞摯的友情，可使一個消極的人變為積極；悲觀者成為樂觀。一個人之所以消極悲觀，並不是天生而成，實在是因為他感到環境的冷酷：社會給他的是苦痛，絕望，而親戚朋友的對待則出以淡漠，尖刻；因之他不能發現快樂高尙的人生，也不能追求美滿的人生興趣。這怎能不使他趨於消極悲觀呢？</p>
<p>然而，熱烈的眞摯的友情，却是一股熊熊之火，它會燒去你苦痛的根源。當你享受到偉大的友情的時候，你會發現這個社會並不如你先前所想像的那樣地被冷酷，淡漠，苦痛所充塞。它裏面也有快樂的泉源；也有與你共感喜怒哀樂的同志，你並不孤單；是的，到了這個時候，你就會感到人生也許有一點意義存在。因而不再消極悲觀，同那感動你的給你眞摯友情的朋友，向人生的旅途上邁進。雖有障礙，但不能阻止你的前進。</p>
<p>沒有一個人不希望獲得懇摯的友情，但現社會的惡習成規，又無處不限制摯友熱情的產生。純潔眞摯友情的產生，至少先要做到爽直忘我的程度。但在自私自利猜疑妒忌的毒素深人人心的今日，要做到忘我爽直的地步，父談何容易？</p>
<p>擁資百萬的富翁，執政當權的官吏，身有百技的萬能，也許會說：憑我的權，勢，財，能，我不需要什麽朋友，更不需要什麼友情。但到了家產蕩然，失官去職，百病叢生的時候，將受怎樣的刺激呀！那時如果沒有眞摯的朋友來慰藉，鼓勵，帮助，則除了消極悲觀終致於墮落自殺外，沒有其他更好的路！</p>
<p>我們應該先發掘眞摯熱烈的友情，因為眞擎偉大的友情是發現美滿崇高人生的明燈！</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>希望多產「美的」電影</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>假使我們就把去年度十大巨片的冠軍—一萬世師表」—來作談話的開始，那我們都得承認：它所以會獲得非常的成功，而被全球的人士讚為「最好」的片子，大半是應該歸功於該片原著故事的成功。其次，就要輪到導演的手法，與演員們的精湛的演技。有時候，我們雖有一個很好，很美滿的脚本，但要是沒有好的導演，與好的演員們來將它很活潑，很生動地演出來的話，那個好脚本也許就會被糟塌掉。的確一張所謂「好」的電影片，在製作過程中，正不知道花費了多少的腦力，辛勤和苦幹呢。</p>
<p>在歐美各國，粗製濫造的電影當然也不是說沒有，但一般的說來，他們的那種認眞的，前進的掄製的精神，確是値得為我們中國的電影界同志模倣的。</p>
<p>華爾滋君在他的那篇談「萬世師表」裏說：國產電影的古裝的似乎有每况愈下的傾向。的確不錯，國產片從「時代片」轉到「古裝片」之後，的確是退步了。能够稱聲「好」的電影，我可以大膽的說一聲：很少！</p>
<p>我所希望的，却是我們都應該為「電影」而電影，我們好的電影脚本也多得很，不一定要柱歷史堆裏去我，只要我們大家肯努力，肯對崇高的電影使命努力的說話，一切就都可以辦了。俗語說得好：「精誠所至，金石為開！」好的電影是怎樣產生的？就由於我們能盡我們的力量。</p>
<p>從今以後，我就望能多有幾張像「萬世師表」，「孤兒樂園」似的，塲面並不偉大的眞正的「好」子在上海出現。、我們正引頸等待着呢！</p>

<h3>故都劇壇動態</h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>孟小冬紅遍九城</p>
<p>李少春北上之初，一度以譚派鬚生戲轟動故都，今少春已離平他去，而息影已久之坤伶鬚生泰斗孟小冬，則又重作出岫之雲，在平組班出演。小冬之戲，素負佳譽，論今日譚派鬚生者，咸以小冬與富英相提並論：復以小冬之投入叔岩門牆，頗獲叔岩之靑睞；每逢小冬出演，叔岩為之監塲導演，益見小冬在平本輕易不肯一露，比則每星期在新新戲院出演一次，一般譚派鬚生，皆視孟之出演為畏途。言菊朋馬連良輩，尙能以新戲號召，譚富英以其譚門本風，專演老戲，戲路又與小冬相同，乃以小冬為唯一勁敵。聞某决小冬在新新戲院貼「搜孤救孤」，上座千人，而同晚富英在長安戲院演「桑園會」「摘纓會」雙齣，僅上四百餘座，兩家座價本相等，而富英之號召，竟不及小冬，小冬在平之紅，概可想見矣。</p>
<p>吳素秋初戀成熟</p>
<p>吳素秋制譽北返，復以「紡棉花」一戲大紅於津沽，於是最近益聲勢赫赫，風頭之健，實不亞當年之雪豔琴也。按素秋與戲曲學校高材生王和霖之一段羅曼史，早成公開之秘密，近更進一層成秘密之公開。蓋吳素秋已微得乃母之同意，短期間內將與王舉行婚禮也。聞吳於婚後，擬合組夫妻班出演，按王和霖為戲曲學校唯一鬚生人才，拜馬連良為師，唱做俱佳，近並兼學武生戲，以素秋年來之紅，果能與和霖合作，當益見精彩，而夫妻同台，亦將傳為佳話也。</p>
<p>老伶工粉粉改行</p>
<p>周瑞生為學楊小樓最肖之武生，論經騐資格，遠在孫毓堃高盛麟諸人之上，惜歲月不許，馬齒日增，今周已屆花甲之年，雖仍不時出演，然往昔之傑作如「金錢豹」「挑滑車」等劇，則已輕易不動。最近消息傳來，周已決心棄共本工，改演關劇（即老爺戲），以周之身材魁梧，嗓音宏亮，設演關劇，必多精彩。又旦角名宿諸如香，亦梨園中之一代宗匠，近亦因人老珠黃，改唱老旦，如香早年原唱鬚生，以其有大嗓有小嗓，故唱老旦必能勝任愉快也</p>
<p>童星藹慕琴有趣的玩意兒。她年祗十歲，骨格柔軟，能作各種姿勢，準備在舞台和銀幕上一獻身手。</p>
<h3>舞台一新人——陳琦</h3>
<p>— 野卉</p>
<p>假使讀者中看過中國旅行劇團演出的葛嫩　話劇，而不是健忘的話，終還該記得，當第一幕剛揭開的時候，就有一隻小曲從舞台背後嬌嬌滴滴地傳到每一個凝神屛息的觀衆耳朶裏來，主唱小曲兒的是誰呢？就是現在要來介紹的—飾美娘的陳琦。</p>
<p>她本姓陳名翠棣，芳齡十九，浙江鄞縣是她家鄉。八一三事變起的那一年，就是她畢業於省立上中初中部的一年。是年秋，該校在租界復課，她就考入高中商科以求深造。不意去年忽遭校方開除，原因是為了她加入中法劇藝社而學校有礙名譽，不得不殺鷄以警猴，加以嚴厲開除手段，因此她就沒有機會再在該校肄業了，否則今年又該是她完成高中階段的時期。最近她又在合衆影片公司香妃一片中作處女的演出，我想以她在舞台上的演技來出現於銀幕上，大概是不會令人失望吧。</p>

<h3>Repeated Attempts by Japanese Troops in Hebei to Cross the River Forcibly Were Painfully Repulsed by Chinese Forces, All Attempts Failed; 3,000 Japanese Reinforcements from Guihua, Suiyuan, Suffered 700-800 Casualties; Japanese Military Vehicles Ambushed near Sudian, Most Were Destroyed</h3>
<p>Lanzhou: After Wuyuan was recaptured by Chinese forces, Japanese troops have been continuously arriving from Baotou, Guihua, and other places, passing through Anbei to the vicinity of Dacai Zhucun (east of Zhegui Township) on the north bank of the Wujia River, attempting to cross the river to launch a counterattack against the Chinese forces. On the morning of the 24th, they transported many rubber boats, a unit of engineers, and a large amount of bridging equipment, and dismantled civilian houses near Zhegui Township (north of Wuyuan) to obtain wood to build pontoon bridges. At noon, a unit of Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops, and after three hours of fierce fighting, more than 300 Japanese troops were annihilated. Until late at night, taking advantage of the dim moonlight, the Japanese troops launched four successive forced crossings to the east and west of Dacai Zhucun, but were all met with a painful counterattack by the Chinese forces. Many Japanese troops were killed or drowned, and they ultimately failed. At noon on the 25th, the Japanese troops were reinforced by more than 3,000 infantry from Baotou and Suiyuan, with 12 artillery pieces, more than 300 vehicles, and five aircraft. Under the combined land and air forces, the Japanese troops launched a forced crossing near Eryangyi Ri (northeast of Wuyuan), but were again intercepted by Chinese forces. A heroic river battle broke out again on the banks of the Wujia River. Chinese troops fought bravely amidst the barrage of bullets, slashing and killing, and bombarded fiercely with artillery, sinking many Japanese boats and killing 700-800 Japanese soldiers. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: At noon on the 21st, Japanese troops from Sudian Township in Changzhi, traveling in 15 vehicles, headed east towards Huguan, but were ambushed by Chinese forces.

(27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese figures have expressed welcome for the victories of the Chinese forces in the battles of Suixi and Lingshan, Guinan, stating that this is a response to the Japanese establishment of a puppet government in Nanjing. This morning, all newspapers carried a long telegram from the Suiyuan front, detailing the circumstances of the death of the commander-in-chief of the Japanese troops in Suixi when he fled the old city of Wuyuan on the 22nd of this month. A certain Chinese commander met with journalists in Wuyuan and spoke freely about the battle, stating that when the Japanese troops invaded the Hetao area in February, the Chinese forces intercepted them at various points, engaging in 51 battles in February. Starting on the 18th of this month, the Chinese forces began to approach important strongholds on the outskirts of Wuyuan, and on the night of the 20th, the Chinese forces simultaneously attacked the new and old cities of Wuyuan, taking them in one fell swoop. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>

In the Quwo area, a large number of Japanese troops have recently been增援 from Linfen, with frequent troop movements, and many vehicles, fully loaded with supplies and ammunition, have been transported to Yicheng. After several ambushes by Chinese forces, many of their vehicles have been destroyed and a large amount of military supplies have been seized. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: Japanese troops from Liucun shelled Duancun with dozens of shells on the 21st, but were subsequently defeated. At the same time, a unit of Japanese cavalry infiltrated Xifang Village, north of Xiangling, but were ambushed by Chinese forces and retreated in disarray. (25th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Firmly Believe that the Motherland's Resistance Will Be Victorious - Remarks by Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Fundraising Committee</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the General Fundraising Committee of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and Zhuang Xiyan, Vice Chairman, arrived in Chongqing by plane yesterday. Reporters visited them again that evening and inquired about the itinerary and tasks of the慰勞団. Chen answered in detail, stating that a group of more than 50 members of the overseas Chinese慰勞団 set off from Singapore on the 6th and will gather in Chongqing in early April to visit the wartime capital and then go to various war zones to comfort the troops and compatriots. They had previously held a meeting in Singapore to discuss various related issues and unanimously agreed that during the war of resistance, the compatriots in the motherland had made great sacrifices and suffered greatly. Although the overseas Chinese are far away, they have never forgotten their concern for the motherland. Therefore, this time they organized a 慰勞団 to return to the country to慰勞 the front-line soldiers and the compatriots in the rear. The motherland has made rapid progress in military, political, economic, cultural, and educational aspects, and they firmly believe that victory will belong to us. The total number of overseas Chinese has always been said to be 8 million, but in fact it is more than 11 million, all of whom are excellent sons and daughters of China. In the past, they have enthusiastically donated money and materials to help domestic refugees and wounded soldiers. Now, they are even more willing to send representatives to visit the motherland to express their condolences. This is not only a responsibility that citizens should fulfill, but also sufficient to show the sincerity of the overseas Chinese. This 慰勞団 did not bring material back to the country, but only brought the patriotic heart of tens of millions of overseas Chinese. At present, there is an urgent need for medicines on the front lines. Due to the limited number of members in this团, they were unable to bring them. They have now found other ways to instruct the Fundraising Committee of the Dutch East Indies to purchase 300,000 guilders (approximately 2 million national currency) worth of quinine and transport it back to the motherland. In addition, overseas Chinese in Malaya have purchased more than 100,000 yuan worth of medicines, which are also on their way. After receiving instructions from Chairman Chiang to request aspirin, they have first transported back the previously purchased stock. In the future, they plan to establish a large-scale pharmaceutical factory in Chongqing to manufacture various medicines and will try to use domestic raw materials as much as possible. The existing pharmaceutical machinery in Southeast Asia is being successively transported back to the motherland for use, etc. (27th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Suixi Campaign and Its Significance</h3>
<p>In recent days, Chinese forces on both the northern and southern fronts have achieved significant victories: on the far right flank, Lingshan in Guinan has been recaptured, and Japanese troops have retreated towards Yongqin; on the far left flank, the new and old cities of Wuyuan, Xishanzui, and various strongholds in the Wulin area in Suixi have been recaptured, with the annihilation of over 3,000 Japanese troops. With frequent victories being reported, the populace rejoices, as if providing a factual response to the Japanese side's disjointed political offensive. The Guinan battlefront, not far from the sea and land borders and close to the southwestern hinterland, is closely watched by both domestic and foreign observers, and its developments are generally well-known. As for the Suixi area, its importance may be even greater than that of Guinan, but it is often overlooked due to its remote location. Therefore, based on what we have seen, we will briefly discuss it.</p>
<p>The Suixi area encompasses the three counties of Anbei, Wuyuan, and Linhe, also known as the Houtao region. The Daqing Mountains stretch to the north, the Yellow River flows around the south, and the Wula Mountains lie across the middle, with a vast loess plain in between. Although the area is close to the northern frontier and may evoke images of barren deserts, the soil is fertile and the region is rich in resources, making it China's most promising granary and pasture, with military value as well. However, the area has long been under the jurisdiction of Mongolian banners, and its administration was established relatively late. Only after the庚子 incident were large-scale reclamation policies promoted. Today's bandit leader Wang Ying, who willingly serves as a henchman of the Japanese, has a father, Wang Tongchun, who was a meritorious official who painstakingly pioneered and developed Suixi. The area is inhabited by both Mongolians and Han Chinese, making it prone to discord. In recent years, the Japanese side has also been actively instigating unrest, often using the so-called Inner Mongolian autonomy issue as a pretext, which has repeatedly evolved into a conspiracy to betray the motherland. In the years 1935 and 1936, the conspiracy almost reached its peak. On one hand, Japanese special agencies spread throughout the entire province of Sui and even reached Dingyuanying and Juyan in the Ningxia area. On the other hand, the Japanese and their puppets used Zhangbei and Bailingmiao as bases, attempting to advance along Suining to spy on Xinjiang, isolate Sino-Soviet communications, and complete a grand encirclement of Outer Mongolia. Although the Japanese and their puppets were defeated in the battles of Honggetu and Bailingmiao, the full-scale war of resistance broke out in an instant. With the loss of Suiyuan and Baotou, the momentum of the western invasion intensified. Fortunately, Fu Zuoyi, Ma Zhanshan, and various Mongolian and Hui forces supported the resistance with great difficulty, fighting in the Daqing and Wula Mountains and the Hetao desert. They reformed military and political affairs, appeased and resettled refugees, and launched guerrilla warfare from time to time, stabilizing half of Suixi. At that time, the Japanese troops extensively built roads and fortifications in the occupied areas and actively engaged in military preparations for attacking Mongolia and the Soviet Union under the guise of supporting the puppet Mongolian regime. Therefore, the apparent peace in the Suixi war situation in recent years is due to the Japanese military being heavily engaged in the Central Plains and lacking sufficient strength to use in the northern deserts. At the same time, the Japanese leaders have never underestimated Suixi as something easily obtainable, viewing it as something that need not be urgently pursued. However, the Japanese side has never ceased its greedy desire for westward and northward aggression and has always regarded Sui province as an important fulcrum in the northern theater. Some commentators have stated that Suiyuan is one of the areas in China that Japan is least willing to easily give up militarily. Judging from the Konoe statement and Japanese public and private documents, this is an undeniable truth.</p>
<p>In late December of last year, Chinese forces launched a light cavalry surprise attack, rushing into Baotou. After a day of street fighting, they withdrew their entire force after achieving battlefield results. The enraged Japanese troops gathered reinforcements and invaded the Houtao area from Baotou and Anbei in mid-January, even reaching Huangyang Mutou on the border of Suining. Some commentators worried that the continued advance of the Japanese troops would endanger international communications, but they underestimated the fact that the Japanese troops were merely taking a risk in the hope of success and did not have any meticulous planning or deployment. At that time, it was the height of winter, and the Yellow River water was shallow, having lost its natural barrier function. The Japanese troops along the Yellow River in Shanxi and Suiyuan never launched a large-scale crossing of the river to provide support, which shows that although the Japanese troops had great ambitions for Suixi, their isolated advance was nothing more than a luxury. Therefore, when the Japanese troops reached the edge of the desert, their strength was already showing signs of exhaustion. Even if the follow-up forces continued to advance, they would inevitably face difficulties due to the natural barrier of Shizuishan and the uninhabited deserts of several hundred li, and they would have no way to cross the river. Suixi has a dense network of canals, somewhat similar to the water towns of Jiangnan. Even if the Japanese troops and their mechanized units can move freely in the freezing season, they will inevitably feel strained after the ice melts in early spring. As expected, the Chinese counter-offensive in mid-February achieved initial success, and Linhe and Shanba were recaptured in succession. After more than a month of hard fighting, the two cities of Wuyuan and the foothills of the Wula Mountains were also recaptured by Chinese forces. The Japanese invasion of the west will inevitably come to an end with this campaign.</p>
<p>The simultaneous victories in Suixi and Guinan also have special significance. It is an undeniable fact that the fighting strength of the Japanese troops is declining day by day. A year or so ago, the Japanese offensive showed signs of slowing down and was far less sharp than at the beginning. However, whenever they occupied an area, their defensive fortifications would be completed after a short period of time, making it difficult to counterattack. But now, the facts prove that the defensive strength of the Japanese troops is far inferior to what it used to be. Those who slander the war of resistance often criticize Chinese forces for never having captured a famous city. This is a fundamental misunderstanding that deliberately ignores the nature and purpose of the "strategy of attrition." However, the recently captured Wuyuan is an important town in Suixi and a hub in the northwest. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has been an important fortress for defending the northern frontier. The Japanese side also intended to hold it for a long time after occupying it this time, so the recapture of this stronghold has extremely profound significance and its impact is not ordinary. This is one aspect. Suixi has always been regarded as a base for cutting off Sino-Soviet communications and encircling Outer Mongolia. However, in the past few years, its strength has only been able to dominate eastern Suixi, and it has never achieved its dream of westward and northward aggression. This time, as soon as it tried, it was defeated, which should be a serious blow to the Japanese northern advance strategy. This is the second aspect. Dividing national unity and provoking恶感 among 部, is a common trick used by aggressors. Recently, they have frequently promoted rumors of Mongol-Hui-Han discord and friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, hoping to provoke division and weaken the resistance. However, according to the United Press, the forces participating in the battle of Wuyuan this time included Ma Hongkui's Ningxia Hui cavalry and Ma Zhanshan's Northeast cavalry, the Eighth Route Army guerrilla forces, Fu Zuoyi's infantry, the Inner Mongolian Self-Defense Force, and the Central Army working closely together to attack simultaneously. This shows that all ethnic groups and factions in China have always fought shoulder to shoulder and worked together for the nation, with absolutely no rifts to speak of. This not only proves the sincere unity among the various ethnic groups and troops but also clears up baseless rumors of friction and conflict. This is the third aspect.</p>
<p>Although the Sino-Japanese battlefield stretches for thousands of kilometers, the recent situation focuses on the two wings, the far left and the far right. These two wings can also symbolize the Japanese power's bifurcated path of southward and northward aggression. Now that the Japanese troops on both wings have suffered defeat, no matter what attempts the Japanese side makes in the political sphere in the future, the outlook for its military future is not difficult to foresee.</p>
<h3>Bankers' Meeting in Chongqing - The Exchange Value of Legal Tender is Stable - The Establishment of the "New Regime" Will Absolutely Not Affect Legal Tender - Wang Kemin's Talk to Foreign Journalists Upon Returning to Beiping</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Reuters received news from responsible sources that bankers held a meeting here yesterday afternoon and unanimously resolved that "the establishment of the Wang Jingwei puppet government will absolutely not affect the exchange value of legal tender, and legal tender will continue to have strong support." (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Wang Kemin, the head of the "Provisional Government," recently returned here from Nanjing and told foreign journalists that the establishment of the "reorganized National Government" may not cause any changes in the personnel of the North China administrative organs. External affairs will be handled by the "Central Government." The status of the new Chinese army in North China has not been decided. In Nanjing, only the date and location for organizing the new administrative organs were discussed. Wang's trip south seemed quite satisfactory. However, since he agreed to cancel the independent status of his provisional government, he said little about future arrangements, which is quite strange. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily News recently published an editorial discussing Wang Jingwei's "new regime," stating that "Our slogans are (1) Support the National Government and Chairman Chiang; (2) Oppose Wang Jingwei's puppet government; (3) Implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang's orders. At this critical moment, the entire population, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and all anti-Japanese organizations must unite to overthrow Wang's puppet government."

<h3>Grave Disaster Situation in Hebei: Six Million Refugees Starving, Disaster Area Covers 16,000 Square Miles</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to representatives from the Hebei disaster area who recently arrived here, there are six million refugees in central Hebei facing starvation. These people are filling their stomachs with tree bark and grass roots, and all the cats and dogs have been eaten. Farmers have no seeds for spring plowing, so there is no hope for an autumn harvest. The government's previous allocation of 1,500,000 yuan for relief is merely a drop in the bucket. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to people engaged in relief work here, at least four million farmers in eastern Hebei are on the verge of starvation due to war and floods. Last year's harvest in many areas was destroyed by water. At the same time, there is a lack of seeds, making it impossible to continue planting. In addition, in many areas, the water has not yet receded, making cultivation impossible. Therefore, there is no hope for an autumn harvest this year. According to Hantson of the Bible Society, it is no exaggeration to say that farmers in many areas are living on tree bark. In some areas, the wheat seedlings have just sprouted, and starving people are already taking the seedlings to fill their stomachs. In addition, it is common for Chinese farmers to eat water plants and wood shavings. The number of families committing suicide due to lack of food is increasing daily. According to samples of food used by farmers in the interior of Hebei displayed by Walker, leader of the Salvation Army here, the food used by these farmers includes cotton from cotton pads, withered water plants, sweet potato vines, and chaff. At the same time, birds in Hebei and Shandong are also suffering the same fate of starvation as humans. These birds are so hungry that they often dig up the seeds sown by farmers from the soil to eat. Therefore, there is even less hope for an autumn harvest this year. According to church statistics, last year's floods inundated 12,000 villages in rural Hebei and 2,000 in Shandong. The disaster area covers 16,000 square miles. Currently, there are still 4,000 square miles where the water depth reaches ten feet. Although there is still flour left in the cities of Hebei, the price is so high that poor farmers and laborers cannot afford to buy it. Currently, there are still 80,000 refugees who fled from the interior last year in Tianjin. The Salvation Army is doing its best to find ways to help them return to their hometowns, but so far only 12,000 people have been sent back, each provided with food, clothing, and a small amount of money. According to medical authorities here, the refugees who remain here have already developed various diseases due to malnutrition, such as trachoma, pneumonia, lung disease, and skin diseases. Scarlet fever is particularly prevalent. According to someone from a hospital here, minor illnesses in the poor often turn into serious illnesses due to malnutrition. Sometimes, even ordinary chickenpox can turn into carbuncles. In addition, the refugees here are afraid that they will have no means of livelihood if they return to their hometowns, so many are moving to the Northeast. However, because they lack the money to buy train tickets, many families are walking five hundred miles to make a living. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Nationals in Tianjin Encounter Unreasonable Obstacles by the Japanese at the Concession Exit</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The British Consul-General in Tianjin, White, recently urged the Japanese Consul-General to pay attention to the increasing number of British nationals being unreasonably obstructed at the exit of the concession in the past few days. In addition to the increasing difficulties encountered by single British nationals at the exit, on Monday and Tuesday, two groups of British nationals, including prominent figures and officials from the British Concession’s Public Works Bureau, were returning to Tianjin after a short vacation in Beidaihe. They were also obstructed at the exit for more than two hours without any obvious reason before being allowed to pass. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently responded to inquiries, stating his personal opinion that there are still many issues that need to be resolved before the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin can be lifted. However, the nature of these issues could not be disclosed. The above inquiry was made in response to the remarks made by a military spokesperson on the 19th of this month, who claimed at the time that, in his personal opinion, there was no hope of lifting the blockade of Tianjin unless Japan, Italy, and other countries returned their concessions to China. Later, the military spokesperson said, "This was a joke." (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Headmaster of Shude School Reportedly Dead After Arrest</h3>

<h3>Chiang Orders Four Banks to Discuss Lowering Prices</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources here today, Generalissimo Chiang, due to the recent exorbitant prices of various commodities in various parts of Free China, has ordered the authorities of the four banks to discuss ways to lower prices. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: General Chiang Kai-shek issued a strict decree yesterday, instructing military and political authorities to effectively implement price control measures to curb speculation in daily necessities and industrial raw materials, and strictly prohibit hoarding and profiteering. Those who deliberately violate this will have their hoarded goods confiscated and will be severely punished. The Price Control Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has dispatched personnel to investigate, and the municipal government and the military police headquarters are cooperating in the matter. The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank have been ordered to hold joint meetings every week to discuss solutions to the price problem.

<h3>Gandhi Urges All-India Congress to Form "Combat" Organization; Those Willing to Accept Imprisonment Can Register; Fighting for Independence Through Passive Resistance</h3>
<p>Bombay: The March 30th issue of Gandhi's newspaper, "Harijan," will contain an article by Gandhi advocating the transformation of the entire organization of the All-India Congress into a "combat" organization, and ordering all members of the Congress Party who are willing to accept imprisonment to register. These passive resistance prisoners will not receive any financial assistance for themselves or their families. The main points to be observed during registration are: (1) Cultivating a spirit of goodwill towards all people; (2) Abolishing the practice of not contacting "untouchables"; (3) Spinning by hand, using only homespun cloth, and rejecting all substitutes. Gandhi's orders are widely regarded as the first practical step in preparing for a "civil disobedience" movement. The order explicitly states that violence must not be used under any circumstances. Gandhi's article states, "As long as violence exists among us, I cannot engage in the struggle. If the registration to be carried out is done in good faith, then I am willing to engage in the struggle." Gandhi hopes that the All-India Congress Committee will organize a passive resistance committee. If there is an enthusiastic response within a month, the step-by-step actions of the passive resistance committee can be expected to succeed in a predictable time. Gandhi also said, "Action without violence means enlisting the world's sympathy against the evil. The number of thoughtful women who abhor the spirit of war is increasing daily. They all hope to find a path to peace and expect India to show the way. If we do not sincerely take action without violence, we cannot obtain the world's sympathy." (Reuters, 27th dispatch)</p>

<h3>People of Various Countries Apply to Immigrate to the U.S.; Quotas for the Next Several Years Are Already Full</h3>
<p>Washington: According to figures released by the State Department, since the Munich Conference, the number of foreigners applying to immigrate to the United States has greatly increased, filling the immigration quotas for foreigners for the next several years. These applications come mostly from Germany, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Not only have they already filled the one-year immigration quota ending in June 1939, but the quotas for the next several years are also full. The number of Germans applying for entry can fill the German quota for eleven years, and the Hungarian quota is already fully booked for the next thirty-seven years. In June of last year, the United States received a total of 657,363 applications for entry, more than double the number in the same month of 1938. In addition to the above-mentioned countries, applications from Albania, Australia, Bulgaria, China, Danzig, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Palestine, Romania, Syria, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and the Philippine Islands have also exceeded the limits of the previous year. The legal annual quota for the United States is 153,774 people. (Reuters, 27th dispatch)</p>
<h3>New Zealand Prime Minister Dies</h3>
<p>London: London received the sad news of the death of New Zealand Prime Minister Savage yesterday, which is deeply regrettable. Savage was sixty-eight years old and had been ill for a long time. When the war broke out last September, Savage was recuperating after abdominal surgery, but he worked hard despite his illness. The fact that the New Zealand Expeditionary Force arrived in the Near East last month is a testament to his efforts. Newspapers recently reviewed Savage's implementation of several important social programs during his tenure and praised his excellent political achievements and great character. Savage was born in Victoria, Australia, the son of a farmer. He dropped out of school at the age of fourteen and first worked as a shop assistant and then as a miner. Later, he engaged in the cooperative movement and paid attention to politics. He was appointed as the secretary of the North Burnside Labor Political Association of Australia. He moved to New Zealand in 1907 and became an important member of the Auckland Labor Political circle. He held important positions in local organizations for many years. In 1919, he was elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives as the leader of the Labor Party. In 1935, the ten-party candidates won, and Savage organized the first Labor cabinet, focusing on assisting the unemployed and protecting the interests of workers, which was strongly supported by the Labor Party. In the general election held in October 1938, the Labor Party won 55 of the 80 seats in parliament, and Savage was re-elected as Prime Minister of New Zealand until today.

<h3>DuPont's Nylon Stockings to Be Available in Spring/Summer, a Formidable Enemy for the Japanese Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Washington: Nylon stockings made from the new synthetic fiber invented by DuPont, which could be a formidable enemy for the Japanese silk industry, will be sold in the market in the spring or early summer. Nylon synthetic fiber is a recently invented material and has now reached a state of perfection. Stockings made from this material can replace real silk. Its advantages are that it is fine and durable. In tests, a pair of nylon stockings was worn every day for several weeks without needing to be repaired or broken. American women are eagerly awaiting the early availability of these stockings, and Japanese silk exporters are paying close attention to this. (Reuters, 27th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Foreign Aircraft Intrudes into Norwegian Airspace</h3>
<p>Oslo: The local radio station recently broadcast a message stating that the military authorities have received reports that a large foreign airplane intruded into Norwegian airspace over the city of Trondheim yesterday afternoon. Its altitude was between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, and its speed was 350 kilometers per hour. Norwegian fighters immediately took off to pursue it, but because they were not fast enough, they were unable to catch up. (Havas, 27th dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Carrier "Ark Royal" Not Sunk by German Aircraft; Sailed for Five Months and Has Now Returned Home; Traveled from the Equator to the Northern Frigid Zone</h3>
<p>London: The British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal", which the Germans claimed to have bombed and sunk last year, has returned home after sailing abroad for five months. It is estimated that the ship and its aircraft have traveled five million square miles of the sea from the equatorial tropics to the northern frigid zone in these five months, and participated in the interception of three large German merchant ships. Its aircraft attacked several German submarines, causing the remaining German submarines to hastily submerge, but the results of the attacks are unknown. The ship was attacked by a German aircraft, which dropped a thousand-pound bomb that fell fifteen feet away from the bow of the ship, but apart from shattering some pottery in the ship, the British ship was not damaged. Captain Power, who has been the captain of the ship since it entered service two years ago, told a Reuters reporter about the near-miss of a torpedo attack around October last year when the British ship "Courageous" was lost. The torpedo passed through the water two to three hundred yards behind the ship. The destroyers protecting the "Ark Royal" rescued some of the crew members of the German submarine after the attack. Captain Power also recounted the situation of the air attack, saying that one of the incoming German aircraft was the bravest, descending rapidly towards the ship from an altitude of about 4,000 feet, and then rising again at 1,000 feet. He saw a bomb leaving the aircraft, and the bomb was unprecedentedly large. He was standing on the bridge and saw the bomb descending and immediately realized that the bomb would not hit the ship. The bomb fell about fifteen feet away from the side of the ship. Even if it had hit, it would not have sunk the "Ark Royal." Captain Power also denied the claim that the "Ark Royal" was tilting, saying that the ship's propeller came off and the bow was slightly damaged, but apart from shattering some pottery, there was no other damage. After this, the "Ark Royal" crossed the Atlantic Ocean and went to Cape Town. Its aircraft participated in the search for the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee", but when the German ship was found by the British ships "Exeter", "Ajax", and "Achilles", the "Ark Royal" was one thousand miles away. Its aircraft took off more than a hundred times, and several of them were lost after getting lost. (Reuters, 27th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Closes Yesterday Morning; Newspapers Criticize the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Parliament closed this morning after Prime Minister Yonai read the Emperor's edict. Japanese newspapers believe that the 10,000,000,000 yen budget is a precursor to economic and social reforms. The Sino-Japanese problem has not yet been resolved and requires huge expenses. The defense budget is the backbone of Japan's new policy and has stipulated a three-year military build-up plan. Newspapers fiercely criticize party politics and blame the cabinet for lacking constructive plans in terms of diplomacy. Newspapers are demanding that Japan strengthen cooperation with countries that recognize the status quo in the Far East. According to the Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun," after the establishment of the "new government," the Yangtze River navigation below Nanjing will be restored. (Haitong, 27th dispatch)</p>

It is said that the purpose of this move is to popularize aviation knowledge and skills, so that Japan will leap to become an air power in the future. (Havas, 26th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Aborted Coup in Bolivia: Bloodless Uprising Quickly Quelled, Anti-Government Conspiracy Also Uncovered in Brazil</h3>
<p>La Paz, Bolivia - A political conspiracy to overthrow President Quintanilla was uncovered here today. It originated with several young military officers who had long been dissatisfied with the current government. Today, Lieutenant Cabero led a battalion of constabulary in an attempted uprising, but the plan was leaked and ultimately failed. The government later issued a statement saying that the rebellion had been quelled and everything had returned to normal. By dusk, crowds gathered in front of the presidential palace to express their support for the government and demand that the government arm them to help quell the unrest. The Minister of Agriculture, representing the President, immediately offered words of comfort. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>La Paz, Bolivia - Regarding the timely suppression of the political conspiracy, political figures here unanimously stated that the reason the unrest was quelled bloodlessly was thanks to the firm stance of Army Chief of Staff General Enteno. A portion of the military officers, due to the upcoming congressional session, feared potential disadvantages to the army and conspired to support General Enteno, who sternly refused, rebuked the officers for their rebellious actions, and planned to prevent the National Army from entering the arsenal in the capital. Upon hearing the news, General Enteno personally led a team of soldiers to defeat them, thus quelling the unrest. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>French Prime Minister Urges National Unity to Face the Situation; Emphasizes the Government's Responsibility is to Wage Total War, Ensuring Everyone Does Their Utmost in the Arduous Struggle to Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>Paris - Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address last night, explaining the process of forming the cabinet and emphasizing that the government's responsibility is to wage total war, hoping that the entire nation will unite to face the situation. An abstract of his speech is as follows: The Prime Minister first stated that the sole objective of his cabinet formation was to establish a government that possesses great determination in action, as war requires determination. He invited all parties to participate in the new cabinet without any prejudice. Although this has not been fully achieved, he believes that the results of their future actions will lead to national unity. It should be known that frequent changes of the cabinet during wartime would only satisfy the policies pursued by German leader Hitler. This crisis has now been fortunately avoided. The question from now on is how to handle national affairs. He has formed a war council at the core of the cabinet, composed of nine key cabinet members. There is no concern that there will be too few people during discussions, and no concern that there will be too many people during action, so it can adapt to the needs of wartime. In short, they have created a kind of sharp weapon, and now it should be put to use. In essence, all decisions should be thoroughly discussed in advance, while all actions should be swift and decisive. That is all. As for the war goals of our country, they have been repeatedly clarified before, so there is no need to repeat them. In a word, our goal remains to defeat the enemy, with absolutely no changes. The people should know that the current situation is a critical juncture, the importance of which is rare in our nation's history. Hitler has previously invaded the Rhineland area, the Memel area, and Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland one after another. Now, he is preparing to invade the economic independence of the Balkan Peninsula countries and openly expand his hegemony to most of Europe. If we allow the enemy to calmly deploy and organize under the National Socialist political system, not only will freedom be extinguished, but the French Republic will also be difficult to preserve. Under this kind of threat, we can only follow the instincts left by generations of wise men and work hard. The government's current responsibility is also very clear: only by waging total war can we overcome the strong enemy. Since the start of the war, our country has resisted the enemy's invasion for seven months. According to historical records, our country has often retreated before advancing in previous wars. Only this time, the enemy has not been able to defeat us at the beginning of the war. Although we clearly know that the current stalemate will eventually change, one thing is certain: France is prepared and will never allow the enemy to invade its territory even one step. Not only that, but our country's military authorities, relying on a comprehensive and strong national defense organization, have been able to minimize the dangers faced by our soldiers and fully protect the safety of our territory. In other words, we have been able to exchange the highest degree of safety for the least possible sacrifice in terms of military strength. Although this alone is not enough to win, in this kind of war of the entire nation, it is also impossible to limit the war to one aspect. For example, in modern warfare, military equipment is the most important thing. Therefore, industrial equipment, the supply of raw materials, the replenishment of workers, and the smooth flow of transportation must all be taken into account. Moreover, in addition to fighting abroad, the country must also take into account the people's livelihood. Therefore, the people must not only fight in the military, but also in agriculture. In order to maintain the balance of foreign trade, our country must also do its best to maintain export trade. For this reason, during this war, not only the army needs people, and the countryside needs people, but also export trade needs people. Thoroughly speaking, everyone in the country should work for the country, whether on the battlefield, in factories, or in the fields. It is necessary to make the best use of everyone's talents and resources. The government's task is to make sure that everyone is in their place. Anyone who still works at the rate of peacetime during wartime is a sinner against the country. At this point, sticking to normal methods is already insufficient. Everyone must work harder to be effective. As for any attempt to hinder the country's struggle, we must eliminate it. In a word, this war will definitely be very difficult. Therefore, we must struggle hard, endure hardship, and find joy in it. We believe that the final victory will belong to us, because we have gathered the resources of the world's two major empires in one place. As long as we can fully utilize them, it is a guarantee that we will be able to win. Moreover, before we win militarily, if we want to achieve anything diplomatically, it depends on our strength and the number of tanks, airplanes, and cannons. Therefore, the final key still depends on the work ethic, spirit, determination, and ability to endure hardship of our entire people. The responsibility lies on our shoulders, and our fate is entirely in our own hands. Therefore, we must stride forward, face the situation together, not succumb to the current difficulties, and strive to overcome them." (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister to Convene Meeting of Ambassadors to Europe to Review International Situation</h3>
<p>Paris - According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Reynaud plans to convene a meeting of French ambassadors to Europe in the near future to review the international situation. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>British War Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>London - According to a Reuters correspondent in Parliament, there is widespread speculation that opposition party members may join the cabinet soon. After inquiring from various sources, very few believe this to be true. However, judging from the current situation, the organization of the government seems likely to change soon, with a smaller group dedicated to directing the war effort. The changes in the leaders of the Ministry of Defense are likely to involve more than one person. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Red Sand Falls in Florence</h3>

<h3>French Government Requests Soviet Union to Replace Ambassador to France; Suritz's Congratulatory Telegram Provokes French Displeasure; Anglo-French Relations Unaffected</h3>
<p>London - According to a TASS news agency report, Soviet Ambassador to France, Suritz, has now been dismissed because the Soviet authorities recognized that he was no longer an envoy favored by the French government. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Soviet diplomatic officials said this afternoon that the French government's request for the Soviet government to recall its ambassador to France, Suritz, would not lead to a breakdown in relations between the two countries. Since Ambassador Natchia left office, the French embassy in the Soviet Union has only had a chargé d'affaires handling embassy affairs. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - When someone asked today whether the recall of Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz had any impact on Anglo-Soviet relations, a spokesperson replied that Anglo-Soviet relations remained unchanged. Suritz's recall was purely an event between the French and Soviet governments and Suritz himself, and had nothing to do with the British government. According to information obtained by Reuters, the telegram submitted by the French government was clearly not a document enjoying diplomatic privileges, but rather a telegram sent by the ambassador on behalf of the Soviet community in Paris. The telegram was encoded in French, so it was subject to the usual French inspection. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris - The general public here believes that the French negotiations in Moscow, which resulted in the Kremlin recalling its ambassador to France, Suritz, demonstrates France's firm will to have its rights respected. Although France is willing to maintain good relations with all neutral countries, it will be difficult to tolerate those who use neutrality as a shield to engage in actions that are truly detrimental to France. Since the start of the war, the Soviet Union has repeatedly demanded all the rights of neutral countries, and has successively signed agreements with Germany. France has still agreed to maintain normal relations between the two countries, but France is unwilling to be fooled. The French side believes that the wording of the telegram sent by the ambassador to Stalin after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty was not permitted by diplomats. The strong actions immediately taken by the French government are said to be entirely within the international scope, but not unrelated to the various measures recently taken to suppress all actions within the country that are detrimental to the Allied countries. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow - On March 19, French Counselor in Moscow, Beyerde, notified Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov that "when the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty was signed, Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz sent a telegram congratulating Stalin (signed by Suritz and sent back to Moscow via the Paris Telegraph Office). The French government believes that Suritz's actions interfere with the political life of France." Beyerde's notification also stated, "The French government considers certain paragraphs of the telegram to be inappropriate. The telegram stated, 'Due to the implementation of the wise policies of the Soviet government and the bravery of our Red Army, the plans stipulated by the Anglo-French war provocateurs who attempted to expand the war in Northeast Europe have failed (the words 'Anglo-French war provocateurs' are underlined). At the same time, the Soviet Union remains an impregnable fortress, and the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism and the enemies of the working masses all over the world will also be crushed in the future (the words 'conspiracies of the enemies of socialism' are underlined).' Although the telegram has been detained by inspectors, the French government still declares that it no longer regards Suritz as a diplomatic representative and sincerely hopes that the Soviet government will recall Suritz immediately."</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky yesterday handed Beyerde the Soviet government's reply, which stated, "(1) The French government believes that because Suritz's telegram does not mention the French government at all, it will no longer regard Suritz as a 'diplomatic representative.' The Soviet government believes that the French side's attitude is completely unjustified. (2) Although the French government has now formally raised the issue of its trust in Suritz, the Soviet government hereby declares that Suritz will be relieved of his post as ambassador to France."

<h3>Outcome of Italian-Hungarian Talks: Formulation of a General Outline for Future Cooperation; Preservation of Peace in Southeastern Europe</h3>
<p>Rome - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki met with Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon for talks. Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Minister to Italy Vilani were also present. An official statement said that the talks lasted two hours and were very cordial. A general outline for future cooperation between the two countries was formulated on the spot. The friendship between the two countries is not only fully compatible with the relations between Italy and Germany and between Germany and Hungary, but also runs parallel to Italy's relations with Yugoslavia. In short, the Italian and Hungarian governments should coordinate their actions to preserve peace in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome - Prime Minister Teleki is scheduled to meet with Pope Pius XII on the morning of the 28th of this month, and then return to Budapest in the evening. The local "Tribune" recently published an interview with Prime Minister Teleki, which stated, "I have no special goals for this trip, only to exchange views on the international situation with the Italian authorities. There is no unrest in the Balkan Peninsula at present, but this does not mean that all problems have been resolved. Our country is very aware of the current difficulties, so our attitude is in line with the urgent needs of Europe and is quite patient, waiting for the development of the situation. As for our country's friendly relations with Yugoslavia, they can continue to improve, but it is not necessary to sign any agreements immediately." In addition, our country's relations with the Soviet Union are also normal, and there have never been disputes on the Hungarian-Soviet border. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Budapest - The Hungarian government's mouthpiece, the "Sterau Habo," recently published a statement saying that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's recent talks in Rome were nothing more than an exchange of views on the common policy of building peace between Italy and Hungary. First, Hungary is now not within the sphere of influence of any major power. In the future, no unilateral decisions may be made regarding Hungary without Hungary's consent, because this period has passed. Second, Hungary does not need to request Italy's support. Italian-Hungarian friendship is extremely close. The Italian side will not even allow a situation to arise that would cause Hungary to ask for its help. Italy has no intention of making Hungary give up its demands to revise its borders. Third, Rome has always known that Hungary's policy for Europe is aimed at the interests of all of Europe, so it has the full support of Italy. Fourth, the sole purpose of the Italian-Hungarian consultation is to study the world situation from the perspective of the common interests of the two countries. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>British-French-Turkish Consultation on Military Cooperation; Turkish Delegation Returns to Ankara</h3>
<p>Rome - According to Ankara telegrams, the Turkish military delegation, which went to Aleppo last week to meet with the Allied military leaders, has now returned here. The leader of the delegation is the Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff, General Gunduz. The matters discussed were the coordination of the military forces of Turkey, Britain, and France, and cooperation under the tripartite agreement. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - Foreign diplomatic officials here recently stated that the British and French governments will hold talks in the shortest possible time regarding the Balkan Peninsula issue and intend to adopt a tougher policy. According to reports from various sources, Turkey's attitude towards the British-French alliance has always been consistent and without any doubt. If Britain and France are forced to take action in the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey will definitely act in unison. In addition, according to information known to political figures here, the blockade measures implemented by Britain and France against Germany will be intensified in all aspects, regardless of the consequences, even if it causes disputes with the Soviet Union. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - It is declared here that French air defense expert General Moren is currently in Izmir, inspecting the Turkish army. He will reform the air defense measures in Istanbul to modernize them. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Lithuanian Friendship Progresses Daily; Soviet Newspaper Publishes Commentary</h3>
<p>Moscow - Nikolaev recently wrote an article in Pravda detailing "Today's Lithuania." The article stated, "Six months have passed since the Soviet Union and Lithuania signed the mutual assistance treaty. During this period, all the malicious rumors spread by the enemies of the Soviet Union and Lithuania have been completely proven to be untrue. Their conspiracies have been shattered and they have now retreated and stopped making noise. The Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty has prevented Lithuania from being dragged into the Second Imperialist War. This treaty has greatly constrained the Anglo-French group, otherwise they would have incited the Baltic countries to participate in the war long ago (they are now carrying out the same incitement in Scandinavia and the Balkan countries). The territorial integrity of Lithuania is currently protected not only by the Lithuanian army, but also by the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union. The strength of the Lithuanian army is now progressing daily. Lithuanian commanders are able to make good use of the Soviet Union's assistance in providing them with military equipment and military raw materials. The Lithuanian Daily stated, "The Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty is a decisive investment increase for Lithuania. New industries and trade have been established in Lithuania." All of this is enough to prove the shamelessness of the rumor-mongers (the rumor-mongers have repeatedly tried to make all parties doubt the sincerity of the Soviet Union's cooperation with the Baltic countries). The Soviet Union has now found the simplest way to unite the Soviet Union with the small neighboring countries. This method has never hindered the independence and freedom of the small countries. We dare to say that Lithuania has obtained a new life and added new achievements to its national history." (TASS Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Molotov's Visit to Berlin; Rumors that German-Soviet Preparatory Talks are Underway; Progress Seems Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - According to this correspondent of the "News Daily" stationed in Berlin, it is undeniable that the preparatory talks for the new German-Soviet contact are progressing unfavorably. The main obstacle is clearly the issue that Soviet-Italian reconciliation must be based on Soviet guarantees to Turkey and Romania. Moscow seems unwilling to abandon its ambitions in the Balkans in the limited time. The correspondent also stated that the rhetoric of the Nazi newspapers has completely changed. The claim that the close cooperation between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union would create a "New Europe," which was promoted by the newspapers last week, can no longer be seen. On Saturday and Sunday last week, a German government spokesperson hinted that the visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Germany was near, but now, when asked about this matter, they only stated that the Soviet Union had denied this visit. Berlin has noticed the Italian side's coldness towards the German declaration of the Berlin-Rome-Moscow triangle relationship. In particular, Rome's radio telegram denied the rumor that the Italian delegation would begin negotiations with Moscow. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen - According to the "National Daily" here, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will go to Berlin tomorrow to hold talks with the German authorities on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. At the same time, the German side also intends to seize the opportunity to woo Italy and the Soviet Union, so that the two policies of the Rome-Berlin Axis and the Berlin-Moscow Axis can run in parallel, and even cooperate in Southeastern Europe. According to well-informed sources, the German authorities are currently working hard to encourage the Soviet Union to guarantee the territorial status quo of Romania. It is said that Bessarabia Province in Romania originally belonged to Russia (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Soviet Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev will return here from Moscow at the end of the week. At the beginning of Shkvartsev's recall, it caused various rumors among foreign people here, saying that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov would come to Berlin to visit. At the same time, the newspapers here wrote articles discussing the Allied countries' intention to expand the scope of the war in Southeastern Europe and their intention to attack the Soviet Union. The "Strong Paper" said that the signing of a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Iran was a new blow to Britain's tricks. The "Berlin Evening News" also said that the new goal of Britain and France was to fight the Soviet Union. The German newspapers' attitude can be represented by the "Berlin Financial Paper." Its commentary stated that Britain has openly admitted to adopting various methods, using the countries of Southeastern Europe to at least economically destroy Germany. The London conspirators did not pay attention to Italy. It should be known that Italy, like Germany, is also paying close attention to the Allied countries' attempt to expand the war in Southeastern Europe. In short, the Allied countries' conspiracy was thoroughly commented on by the Jewish journalist Agan in the Belgian "Metropole Paper." His comment stated, "If the war continues for another ten months, then the neutral countries will no longer exist." (Reuter's Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>American Strategist Johnson Advocates Strengthening the Army; Famous Commentator Winchell Claims America Will Fight for Canada and South America</h3>
<p>New York - Strategist General Johnson, who is currently a political commentator for the New York World Telegram, is worried that Congress will "remove the core" from the funding for reforming the army. The General said that the outcome of the war is now uncertain, and the final division of the dictatorial powers of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan is also not certain. Therefore, there is a possibility of the emergence of one or two major ocean problems during this war. Our first line of defense now has gaps, but if there is a properly equipped army, then this gap is not dangerous. Famous commentator Winchell also wrote an article on the same issue, saying that the United States has a dual responsibility in this dangerous situation. In addition to protecting itself with the smallest army in the world, it also tells the world that we will fight for Canada and South America to protect them. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Oppression of Poles Intensifies; Warsaw University Forced to Close</h3>
<p>Paris – The Polish government information office issued a bulletin today, stating that the German authorities' devastation of schools and maltreatment of educators in the occupied territories of Poland have intensified. For example, the Polish Academy of Fine Arts has been completely destroyed, and Warsaw University (founded in 1818, with 10,000 students) has been forced to close. Furthermore, many university professors have died, including the renowned architect and professor of the Academy of Fine Arts, Sosnowski, and the famous legal scholar of Warsaw University, Dr. Rudostan. In addition, several other professors have been arrested by the German authorities and detained in concentration camps. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3>Annual Report of the He Ming Chamber of Commerce States Optimism About China's Future; Japanese Restrictions on Third-Country Trade Remain Unchanged; No Date Set for Opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Chinese and Foreign Communities Bravely Endure Another Difficult Year</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai He Ming Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting on the 26th at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. on the Bund. Chairman Botweill addressed the members, expressing optimism about China's future and mentioning the countless difficulties encountered by foreign commercial interests during the past year, the reopening of the Yangtze River, and the situation of the Chinese railways. He also praised the resilience of the Chinese people and the courage and perseverance shown by the general merchants.</p>
<p>Having Endured Much Tribulation, Slight Improvement is Seen</p>
<p>Mr. Botweill's speech stated, in part: "Before discussing business, I would like to take this opportunity to represent all members in expressing our regret at Mr. Polson's departure from Shanghai due to illness, leaving his position as Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and wish Mr. Polson a speedy recovery. At the last annual meeting, the Chairman spoke of the courage and perseverance shown by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai and other treaty ports in dealing with various difficulties. In the past twelve months, some difficulties and restrictions have been slightly relaxed, but this is hardly the case for Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places. I believe that the improvement in the trade situation is actually due to the fact that Chinese and foreign merchants in the treaty ports have now endured much tribulation in adverse circumstances and will continue to work hard to achieve this."</p>
<p>Chinese Warfare Impacts Trade</p>
<p>"Trade and shipping gradually prospered last year, but unexpectedly, the outbreak of the European war had an adverse impact in the second half of the year, especially on overseas shipping. The war in China has been going on for three years now. Vast areas have been ravaged, the population scattered, and they are displaced and homeless. Railways, highways, and other means of transportation have been damaged or destroyed. Vast areas are blocked by the Japanese authorities and there is no free trade. The import and export of goods to and from China is still possible, but only a fraction of what trade once was. To what extent we will continue to suffer losses due to the European war remains to be seen. The resurgence of trade in China seems to depend on a satisfactory end to the wars in China and Europe. A dark period seems to lie ahead."</p>
<p>Shanghai's Future Remains Extremely Bright</p>
<p>"However, he has great faith in the future of Shanghai and China as an element of international commerce, hoping that the wars in China and Europe will achieve a healthy resolution, thereby establishing freer financial and economic exchanges between countries. The unification of "New China" under Wang Jingwei is a matter of much speculation, so the war in China is unlikely to end in the short term."</p>
<p>Soaring Prices Create Serious Situation</p>
<p>"In the past six months, the price index of ordinary daily necessities and rents in Shanghai has been of great concern. In January of this year, the price index reached 325.44, which has had a significant impact on workers. Fortunately, workers' wages have been gradually adjusted and subsidies have been issued, so no serious labor unrest has occurred. However, the situation in this area cannot be considered calm. All parties concerned, especially the local authorities of this city, must pay very careful attention to this situation. The urgent task of the authorities is to curb speculation and profiteering and raise prices. The two concessions have taken measures to achieve this goal, which is gratifying."</p>
<p>Astounding Trade Deficit</p>
<p>"According to statistics, China's customs revenue increased by about 77 million yuan in Chinese currency in 1929. However, at this time, it is not possible to accurately analyze the quantity. On the surface, this is an increase in trade. In fact, what has increased is only a limited type of import and export goods. The 1939 customs statistics show a trade deficit of over 300 million yuan. It should be noted that the value of imported goods is calculated by converting foreign currency into legal tender at the official exchange rate of 14.5 pence per unit. If calculated at the black market currency exchange rate, like export goods, the trade deficit would reach 2,194,000,000 yuan."</p>
<p>Japanese Restrictions Still Exist</p>
<p>"Restrictions remain in most treaty ports. Among them, the restrictions in some ports have practically brought third-country trade to a complete standstill. Third countries believe that the restrictions on trade and other commercial and financial activities are unnecessary and only hinder the return to normalcy and reconstruction work in the occupied areas. The purchasing power of the Chinese people has been greatly reduced, especially in 1939."</p>
<p>Most Railways Remain Under Control</p>
<p>"The Japanese army continues to collect necessary products in the areas it occupies to supply the needs of the Japanese army in the war zone, and to supply important raw materials to Japanese industries in China and Japan. From the perspective of foreign holders of railway bonds, the railway situation has not improved, and the Japanese army still prohibits bondholders from exercising their right to inspect and manage railway property. Most railways continue to be controlled by the Japanese. The restored railway commercial transportation in 1928 has seen a large increase, with brisk cargo and passenger transport. However, these railways were built with foreign debts that have not yet been repaid. Now they are carrying cargo and passengers, but they are not repaying a single cent to the bondholders."</p>
<p>The Opening of the Yangtze River is Far Off</p>
<p>"The Japanese government has allowed the opening of the Yangtze River and Pearl River below Nanjing for third-country ships to navigate. The date of opening has not yet been decided. It is hoped that the opening of these two rivers will not be delayed for long. As far as the Yangtze River is concerned, this Chamber of Commerce would like to see traffic resume to Hankou, or at least to Wuhu, as soon as possible. The fact that the Huangpu River and Wusongkou are still not dredged is a cause for concern. This issue is related to the shipping industry of all countries. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese authorities in this city had agreed to resume dredging the Huangpu River and Wusongkou, which is quite satisfactory. The dredging work has been suspended since the outbreak of the war in August 1937, and has hardly been dredged since then. This matter is of great concern to the people of all countries in Shanghai, and it is hoped that the Huangpu Conservancy Board will resume work without encountering unnecessary obstacles and restrictions."</p>
<p>Shanghai's Situation Remains Chaotic</p>
<p>"In 1939, the restrictions in Shanghai were slightly relaxed. However, Yangshupu, a key area for commerce, industry, and shipping, still faced difficulties at the end of the year, and transportation was inconvenient. Labor unrest occurred frequently. The restrictions on passage and curfew were lifted last month. The Nanshi area was also opened at the beginning of this year, but restrictions in other areas remain unchanged. The continued existence of the "badlands" in the western district is a cause of deep concern to the municipal authorities of the Public Concession, and the difficulties have been greatly increased because the "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" occupies part of the administrative rights in this area, including the Concession roads. As a result of negotiations between the Municipal Council and representatives of the Municipal Government, an agreement on policing in the extraterritorial roads area was signed on February 16. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Municipal Council and the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai signed an agreement on policing in the area north of the Suzhou Creek."</p>
<p>The Rejuvenating Power of the Chinese People</p>
<p>"In summary, Shanghai has spent 1939 in the most satisfactory state that could be expected under such circumstances. This is largely due to the resilience of the Chinese people and the courage and perseverance shown by Chinese and foreign merchants in extremely difficult circumstances. I feel that we can be quite optimistic about the future. The sooner everyone understands that the lack of genuine cooperation between countries is a major obstacle to progress and prosperity, the sooner the beginning of a genuine connection to glory will begin."</p>
<h3>Lowering Flags Tomorrow to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang, namely, the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. It has also been stipulated by the Central Government that the martyrdom of Deng Zhongyuan, Chen Ying, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and other martyrs, as well as the passing of Hu Zhantang and Huang Keqiang, will be commemorated on this day. All sectors of society remember the martyrs' generous sacrifice and great achievements. Tomorrow, flags will be lowered to half-mast and entertainment events will be suspended to express mourning. Schools and the Jianghai Customs, etc., will also be closed as usual. Due to the special environment, apart from memorial services held separately by schools, the memorial ceremony will not be expanded. All sectors of society will inherit the legacy of the martyrs, save the country from danger, resolutely support national policy, practice a thrift campaign, and contribute their strength to complete the great cause of resistance and nation-building. The Shanghai Honesty and Shame Movement has also formulated key points for commemoration, stating that, in today's environment, commemorating the revolutionary martyrs is of particularly great significance. All the martyrs adhered to the Three Principles of the People, followed the Premier, and were determined to revolutionize, fighting against the autocratic Qing dynasty. Although the cause was not successful, their spirit of generously going to their deaths was enough to make the Chinese people roar with anger. The Xinhai Revolution was finally completed. The martyrs' achievements will last forever. Although the citizens of Shanghai are in an isolated island with a special environment, high prices, and difficult living conditions, their hardships cannot be compared with those of the soldiers on the front lines and the refugees in the war zones. On this day of commemorating the martyrs, we should take the spirit of the martyrs as a model, sharpen our character, strictly abide by the creed of honesty and shame, and bring the bright future closer and closer.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Implements Austerity Measures; Chinese and Foreign Communities Unanimously Praise; Leaving Taxpayers Room to Breathe and Nurturing Tax Sources for the Future</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council planned to increase the general municipal rate, special property rate, and land rate surcharge by 5% starting on July 1 this year. The Chinese and foreign taxpayers, unable to bear the burden, unanimously expressed their opposition. Now the Municipal Council has organized a special committee to study the reduction of administrative expenses. All heads of Chinese departments have received notifications from the Council to try their best to save money within the possible scope. Eight Western staff members of the Works Department have already agreed to be dismissed. This policy will continue to be implemented. Chinese and foreign taxpayers within the boundary unanimously praised the Municipal Council's resolute implementation of staff reduction and austerity measures, coping with financial difficulties through belt-tightening. Taxpayers believe that in this difficult time, all places where savings can be made should be reduced as much as possible, without affecting administrative efficiency, so that the revenue is not unnecessarily used, leaving taxpayers room to breathe and nurturing tax sources for the future. However, taxpayers are concerned that the reduction in the food rations for prisoners may affect the nutrition of prisoners. They hope that the Municipal Council will give this matter serious consideration before implementation.</p>
<p>Eight Vacancies Will Not Be Filled</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports that regarding the authorities' reduction of eight Western staff members of the Works Department, the Director-General and Chief Executive Officer of the Municipal Council, Mr. Phillips, stated that the eight people laid off will not be replaced by others, because the Municipal Council's any department does not embrace the policy of dismissing old employees and hiring younger employees with lower salaries to replace them. As far as he knows, apart from the Works Department, the Municipal Council does not intend to immediately lay off staff in other departments. However, all department heads have received orders to practice thrift.</p>
<p>The Council Further Cuts One Western Staff Member</p>
<p>Also, the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that one more Western staff member of the Municipal Council's Works Department has been laid off. The person is Mr. Natte, an assistant in the accounting department, who has been working for 11 years. In three more years, he would have been able to receive the highest pension of 100 pounds per year. Having been laid off this time, he can get a pension of about 80 pounds a year.</p>
<p>Public Opinion Survey Opposes Rate Increase</p>
<p>The local "Purchase News" recently conducted a survey to investigate the opinions of people from all walks of life on the Municipal Council. According to reports, the magazine issued more than 5,000 opinion forms. Over a thousand completed opinion forms have been submitted to the magazine. The survey has now ended and was published yesterday. The details are as follows: In these one thousand opinion forms, 67% agree to hold the ratepayers' meeting on Saturday. 25% believe that it can also be approved if it is held after office hours. Only 8% agree to hold it at the original time (i.e., 2:30 pm on working days). Regarding the Municipal Council's proposed increase in the municipal rate, 96% believe that the salaries of the senior staff of the Municipal Council are too high, 94% believe that the Municipal Council's music team is too large, over 90% believe that houses and real estate held by speculators should also pay land rates to the Municipal Council to maintain the Municipal Council's expenses, 90% believe that the Municipal Council should find ways to maintain expenses without increasing the municipal rate, 80% believe that the Municipal Council's expenses should be fixed within a certain range, 80% believe that the Municipal Council's property should be sold to the highest bidder, 73% believe that the Municipal Council staff should be openly employed, 69% believe that the Municipal Council staff should have their salaries deducted during vacation leave, 84% believe that the Municipal Council's retention of high-salary old staff is a wrong measure, 71% believe that the Municipal Council's employee subsidy system should be abolished, 77% believe that the Municipal Council can issue a municipal lottery, and 94% believe that the suicide rate and various sufferings suffered by Chinese people in the Concession should be helped in some way.</p>
<h3>Minnie Moller and Maclay Lighters Requisitioned and Sailing South</h3>
<p>The British-owned Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.'s Minnie Moller and Maclay lighters, originally chartered by shipping merchants, were respectively operating on the Ningbo-Songmen line and the Shanghai-Beisha line. The two vessels each have a carrying capacity of approximately 300 tons. It is now understood that both vessels are under orders from the British government for wartime use. After receiving the order, the vessels have separately suspended operations and returned to Shanghai, and will soon sail to the two oceans to await orders. It is also understood that since the start of the war, the British government has successively requisitioned several lighters in Shanghai, including four from the Shanghai Tug &amp; Lighter Co., five from Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., and several steamships from the British-owned Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire companies have also been requisitioned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Izumo Battleship Sailed to Nanjing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The flagship Izumo of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet suddenly sailed out of Wusongkou on the afternoon of the 11th of this month and cruised around, returning to Shanghai on the 15th, berthing at the original site of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf in Hongkou. At around 5:00 AM yesterday, it suddenly raised anchor and sailed out of port, heading up the river. It is said that it is going to Nanjing. It is heard that a large number of Japanese naval dignitaries are on board the ship to celebrate the establishment of the puppet "government."</p>
<h3>Subcommittee Meeting of the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee</h3>
<p>The Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession Municipal Council held two meetings on the 7th and 13th to review the investigation reports of the subcommittees and study the methods of suppressing prices. It has generally been decided and submitted to Mr. Baudez, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, for verification. (1) Negotiating with the Japanese side to issue procurement permits to go to the mainland, (2) organizing a grain transportation and sales general agency, and (3) negotiating with the Kailuan Mining Administration to supply cooked coal, have all been carried out step by step. However, because the market situation changes rapidly and speculation and manipulation must be prevented at any time, the work of the committee is still actively progressing and continuing to conduct investigations and present discussions. The committee held a subcommittee meeting at the French Municipal Council at 2:00 PM yesterday, discussing matters for a total of two hours. It is heard that the information collected and produced by the police department was submitted for review during the meeting, and it was decided to wait for the report from the police department of the Public Concession to be sent for reference before making a decision, and to implement various methods of suppressing prices jointly by the two concessions to reduce the burden and difficulties of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Chinese Absorb Spiritual Food: Over 224,000 Copies of the Bible Sold in Various Parts of China Last Year</h3>
<p>According to the annual report of the China Bible Society, the British Bible Society, and the American Bible Society (ending December 31, 1939), as reported by the North-China Daily News, a new record of 224,282 copies of the Bible and New Testament and Old Testament were sold in various parts of China last year, an increase of 175% compared to ten years ago, and an increase of 59% compared to 1938. In December of last year, about 35,000 copies of the Bible and New and Old Testaments that had already been ordered were temporarily canceled due to soaring paper prices, which are not included in the statistics. It is truly commendable that the Chinese people are still able to sincerely absorb spiritual food during this period of arduous struggle when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as precious as cinnamon. Historian Heng said that the Bible and the history of European and American nations have already been integrated. According to reports from the China provincial associations, Chinese students now love to read the Bible, and this situation is even more so in free China. Thinking of this, we cannot help but ask: Will the Sino-Japanese war integrate the Bible into the lives of the Chinese people?</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Collect Taxes with Bayonets, Causing High Prices; Japanese Troops Promise to Eliminate Inland Goods Taxes; If the Promise is Kept, Prices May Fall</h3>
<p>The Continental Times reports that, according to well-informed sources, if the Japanese troops keep their promise and abolish the restrictions and taxes imposed on various products transported from the mainland to Shanghai, the solution to the high prices in this city will be in sight. Even if the Japanese authorities in this city are sincere in making this promise, it is doubtful whether it can be implemented in the short term, because the troops stationed in remote areas still act arbitrarily. The Price Stabilization Committee of the Municipal Council recently discussed with the Japanese military authorities in this city. The latter tried its best to eliminate the various taxes levied on mainland products transported to Shanghai. At this point, the Japanese side officially admitted for the first time that there were restrictions on local products transported to Shanghai. In the past, the Japanese side always denied restrictions. The Japanese army often "extorted" by collecting taxes with bayonets. This is the main reason for the extraordinarily high prices in this city. Unless these illegal restrictions are lifted, prices cannot fall. Since the various taxes are privately extorted by low-ranking officers and sentries, it seems unlikely that the orders from above will have any great effect on eliminating extortion. To make it effective, the orders must be enforced vigorously. It is doubtful whether the Japanese authorities will issue this order, because the Japanese authorities collect a lot of revenue from taxes.</p>
<h3>Mr. Butrick to Act as U.S. Consul</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that Mr. Gauss, the former U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, has been appointed as the first U.S. Minister to Australia. All affairs of the U.S. Consulate General in this city, from the 6th onwards, will be temporarily handled by Mr. Butrick, the executive officer of the consulate, until the new U.S. Consul-General to Shanghai arrives from the United States. However, there is no news as to who will be appointed to the new Consul-General position. Mr. Butrick previously worked in the Far Eastern Affairs Division in Washington, D.C., and then served as an executive officer in the U.S. Consulate Generals in Hankou and Shanghai for eight years.</p>
<h3>Domestic Postal Rate Increase Temporarily Not Implemented</h3>
<p>Regarding the domestic postal rate increase, a reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Postal Administration and learned that the bureau had not yet received an order from the Kunming Postal Administration as of yesterday. However, this matter must be implemented sooner or later, and it is obviously too late to say that it will be implemented on April 1. In addition, the recruitment of postal assistants by the bureau this time has seen a surge in applicants due to the permission of female participation. After this batch of postal assistants are recruited, they will be dispatched to post offices in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions.</p>
<h3>Mr. Allman's Talk as the Elected American Councillor of the Municipal Council: Handling the Council's Affairs Without Any Favoritism, Mr. McMichael Responded Franky to Being Defeated</h3>
<p>Mr. Allman, the chief editor of Shen Bao and the elected American councilor of the Municipal Council, recently gave a speech that, concerning Mr. Allman's opinions on the administration of the Council, it may not be appropriate to elaborate as there is a lack of detailed understanding. He could serve the Council with a humble attitude and without any trace of prejudice. In addition, Allman did not express surprise at the success of the preliminary election, saying that this was somewhat expected. The voting on the day before yesterday ended at 5:00 PM, and the results were announced at 6:20 PM. The three vote counters worked quickly, on the one hand maintaining the confidentiality of the work, and on the other hand making great efforts to prevent dishonest votes from being cast.</p>
<p>The election results were very satisfactory. After the announcement of the election results, all the ballots were burned in front of the photograph of President Washington at the American Association. All ballots were sealed in numbered envelopes and then placed in sealed boxes. Before opening the ballots in public, the numbers on the envelopes were first checked against the stubs to prevent any double voting. After the counters read out the numbers on the two envelopes, the letters on the stubs were canceled, and then they continued to read on. The procedure was extremely thorough. As for Mr. McDonald's defeat, he personally did not express any displeasure because of this. According to McDonald's, there were three candidates for two seats, and of course one person would be defeated. When the reporter asked if he felt any regret, Mr. McDonald replied that he did not. The position of Municipal Council director is a heavy duty, and there is nothing to regret if I am not elected.</p>
<h3>Flour Sold at a Discount Again; Prices Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon; Factories Estimate That Each Bag Must Be Thirteen Yuan; Noodle Manufacturers Advocate Twelve Yuan Per Bag; Group Purchases of Rice Can Be Released from Warehouses, and Rice Prices Are Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a joint meeting of treasurers was held at No. 59 Hong Kong Road to raise funds and withdraw foreign rice. Li Wenjie, Xi Yushu, Lu Gaoyi, Hu Yongqi, Chen Jisheng attended. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the association has raised more than 100,000 yuan through private credit loans in recent days. Among them, Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the association, recognized a loan of 50,000 yuan, and Guo Shun, the executive director of the association, recognized a loan of 60,000 yuan. The remaining amount was also enthusiastically recognized by others. Therefore, although the amount of the funds reached 1 million yuan, with the active planning of the responsible authorities, it is not difficult to raise the full amount in the shortest period of time. At that time, the foreign rice stored in the warehouses will be released one after another to adjust the people's food, and the rice prices in Shanghai are expected to continue to fall.</p>
<p>Prices of Discounted Noodles Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, noodle manufacturers sent five representatives, Wang Jinwen, Wang Fuxin, Zhu Zhenfang, Cang Guofeng, and Li Bangkun, to meet with Deputy Director He of the Municipal Council. Mr. He received them and reported on the progress of the discussions with the factories on the sale of discounted flour. It is said that, due to cost reasons, the factories insisted on the amount of thirteen yuan per bag. The representatives said that the price of recycled flour on the market is only 13.2 yuan per bag. The price difference of the discounted flour from that on the market is minimal, which is of minimal value. It was requested that the price of discounted flour be limited to 12 yuan per bag. Mr. He, with the people's food at stake, will immediately contact the factories again at a price of 12 yuan a bag. Therefore, the reply from yesterday has not been received yet.</p>
<p>Many Suggestions for Selling at Discounted Prices. Since the prices of rice and grain soared, flour has become the main food for tens of thousands of civilians in the city. Eating noodles is simpler than eating rice. For just a dime or two, one can purchase it. Therefore, the most urgent way to solve the food problem in this city is to sell flour at a discount. Selling flour at a discount was held last month, but because the minimum unit for purchase was one bag, the general public still could not benefit from it. At this time when wood prices have not fallen and flour prices are rising again, social figures have expressed many suggestions in light of the lack of a clear path for the people's food future. They requested that the authorities hold the sale of discounted flour again. The solution is to divide each bag of No. 4 flour into four small bags, and the price is also calculated as one-fourth of the price of each bag. In this way, the poor can afford to buy it, and the sale can achieve a universal effect.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market: Population Tax Reduction; Total Population Below Four Million; Goods Supply Gradually Balancing</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, people from the mainland flocked to Shanghai for refuge. At its peak, the total population reached over 5.5 million. However, due to the continuous rise in commodity prices and the manifold increase in the cost of daily necessities, those who came to Shanghai from the mainland have mostly returned to their hometowns. According to surveys and statistics, the recent return of people to their homes has caused Shanghai's population to drop to 3.89 million. As a result, the supply of various goods is gradually becoming balanced, and the speculative atmosphere may be curbed.</p>

<h3>Inheritance Tax to Be Levied Starting July 1st; Collection Agency to Establish Evaluation Committee; Temporarily Handled by Income Tax Office</h3>
<p>Inheritance tax is an important backbone of the direct tax system. The proposal to establish it dates back to the fourth year of the Republic (1915). Now, the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules have been promulgated by the National Government one after another and will be uniformly implemented nationwide starting July 1st. All forms required for collection have been agreed upon. Inheritance Evaluation Committees will be established in various locations. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Instructions for Filling Out Forms for Tax-Exempt Amounts</p>
<p>The Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations stipulate that anyone who leaves property within the territory of China at the time of death shall pay inheritance tax in accordance with the regulations. Citizens of the Republic of China who have a domicile within the national territory but have property abroad shall also be taxed. The inheritance tax is levied on the heirs and legatees of the estate. Estates with a total value of less than 5,000 yuan are exempt from inheritance tax. The deceased's successor should fill out a report form in the prescribed format, stating: (1) the name and address of the deceased; (2) the place where the inheritance began; (3) the date on which the inheritance began; (4) the date of the last inheritance; (5) the estimated amount of the main inheritance and its location; (6) when the successor has analyzed or donated his property within three years before the commencement of the inheritance, the value of the property and the name and address of the property successor or donee; (7) the name and address of the reporter, or his residence if he has no domicile. If the reporter is the estate administrator or the executor of the omission, the date of his appointment and the name and address of the taxpayer shall be stated.</p>
<p>Establishment of Evaluation Committee for Handling</p>
<p>The collection of inheritance tax is temporarily entrusted to the Income Tax Office. Local inheritance tax collection agencies will establish Inheritance Evaluation Committees. Each committee will consist of five to seven members. In addition to one representative from the inheritance tax collection agency serving as an ex officio member, the Ministry of Finance will appoint members from the following local candidates: (1) judicial organs; (2) land administration or civil affairs agencies; (3) education or cultural agencies; (4) local financial agencies; (5) local self-government agencies or organizations; (6) local impartial individuals. Evaluation committee members will serve without pay for a term of three years. Evaluation committee members may not participate in the evaluation of inheritances for themselves or their spouses, blood relatives within the fifth degree, or relatives by marriage within the third degree. Inheritance tax collection and evaluation personnel shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the type, amount, and related documents of the inheritance. Violators shall be punished in accordance with Article 318 of the Criminal Law for obstructing the crime of secrecy.</p>
<p>Uniform Taxation Starting at 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>A uniform tax of 1% will be levied on inheritance totals exceeding 5,000 yuan. For inheritance totals exceeding 50,000 yuan, additional taxes will be levied on the excess amount according to the following tax rates and calculated by grade: (1) 1% on the excess over 50,000 yuan up to 100,000 yuan; (2) 2% on the excess over 100,000 yuan up to 250,000 yuan; (3) 3% on the excess over 250,000 yuan up to 500,000 yuan; (4) 4% on the excess over 500,000 yuan up to 750,000 yuan; (5) 5% on the excess over 750,000 yuan up to 1,000,000 yuan; (6) 7% on the excess over 1,000,000 yuan up to 1,500,000 yuan; (7) 9% on the excess over 1,500,000 yuan up to 2,000,000 yuan; (8) 12% on the excess over 2,000,000 yuan up to 3,000,000 yuan; (9) 15% on the excess over 3,000,000 yuan up to 4,000,000 yuan. An additional 5% will be levied for each additional 1,000,000 yuan. 50% will be levied on the excess amount over 10,000,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Exchange Rate Fluctuations; Trade Deficit at Jianghai Customs Increasing; Future Changes Cannot Yet Be Predicted</h3>
<p>Since Easter, gold prices have soared and foreign exchange has shrunk, similar to the situation at the opening of the previous year. According to the investigation by the Datong News Agency reporter, the soaring gold prices and the fall of the British pound, as well as the manipulation of speculators, are certainly factors, but trade and the political situation are also related. Recently, Shanghai Customs' foreign trade shows a surplus on the surface (the Customs calculates the value of imported national currency using the gold unit exchange rate of the Central Bank, which differs greatly from the official market exchange rate), but in reality, it is a deficit, although much improved compared to last year. For example, in January of this year,</p>
<p>Shanghai Customs' deficit was only equivalent to over 90,000 US dollars. By February, the sales of raw silk to Britain and France had decreased, and the Indian market for cotton yarn and cotton cloth had also been hit. Exports declined, while imports of goods such as cotton, rice, and coal increased. Therefore, it is rumored that Shanghai Customs' trade deficit in February was actually 6.2 million US dollars. Under the uneasy exchange market, this trend of trade difference will naturally weaken the exchange rate. Recently, the establishment of the Nanjing puppet "regime" has attempted to issue banknotes and disrupt the legal currency. Those with superficial views are inevitably affected. However, according to another message,</p>
<p>Shanghai's US dollar notes are estimated to be about 30 million US dollars, certainly exceeding demand. The reason for its strong market is nothing more than speculative manipulation and control of the market. As for the relationship between the puppet "regime" and the financial community, the business community has inconsistent views, and some even see it as a sign that the legal currency will improve. Therefore, future changes in the exchange market cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3>One Check Missing from Checkbook; Bank Clerk Suspected and Interrogated; Later Discovered That the Check Had Been Cashed; Chen Renhao Arrested and Ordered to Summon Witnesses for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>On December 30th of last year, Yuchanglong Company, No. 270 Kang Nao Road, opened a current account at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road. However, after the company received the checkbook, it discovered that one check, No. 853069, was missing. It immediately reported the loss to the bank. On February 7th of this year, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank received more than 1,000 checks from the mountain bill exchange. That day happened to be</p>
<p>the end of the lunar year, and the accounts were extremely busy. At that time, the bank clerks sorted the received checks into categories, sent them to the respective departments for verification, and then sent them to the accounting department. However, the accounting department did not check the total number that day. The bank followed the custom of closing for four days during the Lunar New Year. When it reopened on February 12th, the accounting department discovered that one check was missing, totaling 27,000 yuan. After detailed investigation, it was learned that the check belonged to Yuchanglong's</p>
<p>lost check, which was submitted by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank was deposited by the customer Xintaihe Company. When Zhejiang Xingye Bank notified Zhejiang Shishi to stop payment on February 14th, the 27,000 yuan had already been withdrawn by Xintai on February 12th and 13th. If Zhejiang Shishi had stopped payment, then this amount would not have been withdrawn by Xintai. Afterwards, Zhejiang Xingye reported to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng, it was learned that the so-called Xintaihe Company</p>
<p>did not exist and was a fictitious creation, clearly an organized event. After comparing the handwriting, it was found that the handwriting of Chen Renhao, the seal verification clerk in the bank's current deposit department, was slightly similar to that on the checks opened by Xintaihe. It was suspected that Chen was responsible, and he was arrested and sent to the First Special Court. He was granted bail of 8,000 yuan and the hearing was postponed. Yesterday, Judge Tian Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court held a hearing. The patrol room lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted for forgery and fraud. Zhejiang Xingye Bank also hired lawyer Tang Mingshi to file a related civil lawsuit. Chen Renhao hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend him. His</p>
<p>main point was that the handwriting of those who practiced calligraphy in our country was roughly the same, especially with fountain pens. Moreover, this matter required the hands of many people and could not be done by one person alone. Furthermore, the incident that occurred on February 7th was not discovered until the 14th, and the money had already been withdrawn before the discovery. How could a clerk in the defendant's position have such skills? Moreover, the defendant had served for more than ten years and had never made a mistake, etc. Judge Qian then interrogated all relevant witnesses once. Because further investigation was needed, he ordered the hearing to be postponed.</p>

<h3>Great Fire at Jardine Matheson Warehouse; Huge Quantities of Cotton and Silk Cocoons Destroyed; Enormous Losses; Cause of Fire Unknown</h3>
<p>At 9:27 last night, a fire broke out at the Jardine Matheson Warehouse located on the east side of the Old Garbage Bridge on North Suzhou Road and North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession. Immediately, black smoke billowed and flames soared. Upon receiving the report, the Central Fire Brigade rushed many pump trucks to the scene to connect water for firefighting. However, the goods stored in the warehouse were all cotton, silk cocoons, and Huzhou silk, which are not easy to extinguish once they catch fire. When reporters rushed to investigate, they saw the fire illuminating the sky, breaking through the roof. Many firefighters climbed ladders six or seven feet high or crossed the roofs of neighboring houses to try to put out the fire. However, the fire spread rapidly and could not be extinguished for a while. In addition, the wind aided the fire, and sparks spread everywhere. As of this morning when this newspaper went to press, the fire was still spreading. It is estimated that the losses in this fire are no less than several hundred thousand.

<h3>Bank Employee Embezzles Funds and Flees; Incident Occurred Before Tomb Sweeping Festival Closure; Amount Was 2,800 US Dollars</h3>
<p>Pingming News Agency reported that a bank in this city, known for its stability, suddenly discovered that an employee had embezzled funds and fled, which was unexpected. According to the interview by the Pingming News Agency reporter, a warehouse employee, Zhou, had worked in the bank for more than ten years, was cautious, and had no faults. Moreover, he was very strict with himself and had no bad habits. Therefore, the bank also held his savings. No one suspected that he would do anything unexpected. Unexpectedly, after the Tomb Sweeping Festival closure, he did not ask for leave and suddenly disappeared without a trace. Employees were sent to visit his home, but he was gone. An urgent check of the warehouse revealed that 2,800 US dollar notes (equivalent to more than 40,000 legal currency) were missing. The reporter inquired with the bank. At first, they said that nothing had happened. Then they said that there was no such large amount of US dollars. Later, they inquired with a well-respected bank president in the same industry, who said that this was indeed the case, but the amount was 2,800 US dollars and not the rumored 270,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that a certain evening newspaper published that a warehouse employee of a certain bank embezzled and fled with 270,000 US dollars, equivalent to more than 4 million legal currency.

<h3>Refereeing Errors in the International Cup Final: Chinese Team Lodges Protest. Manager Li Jun Signed and Delivered to the Western Union Yesterday. The Appeals Committee is Scheduled to Convene Tomorrow for a Judgement.</h3>
<p>In the final of this year's International Cup football match between the Chinese team and Portugal, the referee Pan Tuo was partial, deliberately biased, and abused his power. When Meng Yiliang, the central defender of the Portuguese team, indulgently committed a fierce foul, he wrongly penalized innocent players, reversing right and wrong, causing the Chinese team to lose a penalty kick. Nearly 20,000 spectators in the stands were in an uproar, but Pan Tuo turned a deaf ear. Sun Jinshun, the captain of the Chinese team, lodged a verbal protest on the spot, which was also ineffective. The Chinese team ultimately lost the championship by a score of 2-3 due to the loss of this goal. The next day, Chinese and Western newspapers unanimously criticized the incident, because the facts were obvious and Pan Tuo could not cover up the eyes and ears of the world. The dignity of the referee was completely lost. According to the situation on that day, the Chinese team pointed out that Pan Tuo was negligent in his duties. The secretary of the association, Shi Bike, heard that the appeals committee of the association had scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to make a fair judgement. The committee should be able to accept public opinion based on the facts and decide on remedial measures. Otherwise, the national competition will be a laughing stock at home and abroad due to the referee's dereliction of duty.</p>

<h3>Finance: Sharp Drop in US-British Exchange Rates of Over One Jiao and Four Fen. Shanghai US Dollar Exchange Rate Sets Tightest Record. Spot and Forward Rates Diverge, Almost Reaching 3.75.</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was affected by the overseas exchange rate of US against British currency, which plummeted by one jiao, four fen and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths, so the HSBC US dollar exchange rate in this city was reduced by one hundred twenty-five thousandths. The Dutch, Ryukyu, and Japanese exchange rates also followed suit, while other exchange rates such as the British exchange rate were stable. As for the domestic situation, the market was tight first and then declined, with unprecedented changes. The continued decline in the US-British exchange rate in the early morning was beyond the expectations of most operators, resulting in a situation where the British exchange rate was stable and the US exchange rate was reduced. The US dollar exchange rate immediately saw 6.0625 yuan, which broke the tightest record of 6.1875 yuan on August 11 last year, but it was only a flash in the pan. The US dollar exchange rate for April was even tighter, with the price once bid up to 5.6875 yuan at the opening, with a difference of almost 3.75 from the spot price, but there was only a price and no market (if arbitrage were carried out at this price, a huge profit of 6.7% could be obtained). However, due to the sudden blocking by speculators, the market sentiment hardened invisibly, and foreign firms were more willing to sell than before. Everyone believed that the exchange rate could rebound, so the potential gradually relaxed, and the dumping by foreign firms and speculators did not stop. At that time, the US dollar exchange rate for April had reached 6 yuan, and British gold was also at 4 office shillings. The spot US dollar exchange rate of 6.1875 yuan was relatively easy to close. As such, the market closed calmly at noon. As a result, the British exchange rate was stable and the US exchange rate was tight by 0.03125. There were quite a few people doing arbitrage today, with a profit of about 0.1% to 0.26%.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Will Rise Today</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bar was recently down 0.0625, the far end was reduced by 0.05625, New York silver prices were still flat, London gold prices were stagnant, the exchange rates of British, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat, the US dollar against the British currency plummeted by one jiao, four fen and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths, and the US dollar against Shanghai dropped by one jiao, and the US dollar against France plummeted by eight fen and six hundred twenty-five thousandths. The central exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 office shillings and 0.125 for British gold, and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was due to the further decline in the British-US exchange rate. At the same time, the US dollar exchange rate for April was priced at 5.6875 yuan, with a difference of 3.75 from the spot price. After the opening, speculators first sold, and the market immediately eased. It is estimated that foreign firms absorbed the US dollar exchange rate for April at 5.8125 yuan and 0.875 from speculators. Later, foreign firms also sold British gold at 3 office shillings and 0.9375 and 0.96875 to Sassoon for April. Before long, HSBC announced the exchange rate, with the British exchange rate stable and the US dollar exchange rate reduced by 0.03125. The balance tax for silver was reduced by a small amount of 0.0035. After that, speculators generally turned bullish on exchange rates, so they mostly bought British currency and sold US dollars. The potential continued to relax. It is estimated that speculators sold the US dollar exchange rate for April to foreign firms from 5.9375 yuan to 6 yuan, and foreign firms, Datong Bank, and HSBC stuffed British gold at 4 office shillings to speculators. At this time, the spot US dollar exchange rate of 6.1875 yuan could be settled at one time. At noon, HSBC suddenly took the opportunity to absorb it, so the situation gradually stabilized. It is estimated that it once ate the US dollar exchange rate for the current month at 6.0125 yuan and extended it to the noon closing. British gold was 4 office shillings and 0.125, the US dollar was 6.015625, and the British order for this month was 4 office shillings and 0.109375, and the US dollar was 6.0125. The British gold in April was 4 office shillings, and the US dollar was 5.9375. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot British gold was stable and the US dollar was tight by 0.03125, the British currency for this month was loose by 0.046875, the US dollar was soft by 0.03125, the British currency for April was long by 0.078125, and the US dollar was cheap by 0.03125. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Black Market US Dollar Very Tight. Gold Prices Rise and Then Suddenly Reverse. Although a Peak of 5,450 Yuan Was Seen, the Bulls Were Unable to Continue Holding and Turned to Selling for Profit.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash black market situation, although the closing price was 12 yuan lower than the previous day, the initial soaring was endless, setting new gold price records, with a peak of 5,450 yuan. The morning opening saw the US-British exchange rate falling sharply again, and the near and far-term US dollar exchange rates tightened consistently. Sentiment was extremely enthusiastic, and gold firms bought aggressively, jumping 70 yuan to 5,440 yuan. Before long, although currency dealers sold some, falling slightly by 25 yuan, it only increased the prevalence of buying. Gold firms and others entered the market to search for goods, and suddenly the chips were not enough to grab, and 5,450 yuan was seen. Who knew that it was rumored that foreign firms such as HSBC would refuse to make new gold mortgages and would accelerate the recovery of loans that had already been issued, which affected general trading, and those involved were even more eager to sell without hesitation, and the profit-taking retail investors came out at high prices, which the exchange was happy to see. Soon, it fell sharply. Furthermore, sentiment on the exchange rate market was bullish before the close, resulting in a small loss of 12 yuan, to 5,358 yuan, which was also rare. Due to the strong trading in the morning (about 4,000 taels and above), the clearing was time-consuming, so the industry decided to suspend the market as a special case. It was heard that there was no trading outside the market, and the prices also lacked changes. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops once reached a high of 545 yuan, but finally returned to flat, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. Customs gold and other items were still flat.</p>
<p>Cash Fell Slightly by 12 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial exchange rate was reduced by more than one jiao, the black market US dollar was extremely tight, sentiment rebounded again, and there was a chorus of buying. The opening immediately raised 70 yuan, and the gold firm bought 50 taels from the silver shop, for 5,440 yuan. Later, some currency dealers sold their long positions, immediately falling back 25 yuan, and the cash firm sold 50 taels to the silver shop, for 5,415 yuan. Taking into account that a certain gold firm came to grab wildly again, it rose again by 35 yuan, and the gold firm bought 20 taels from the currency dealer, for 5,450 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate turned hard, and it was heard that foreign banks such as HSBC were urging the redemption of mortgages, and sentiment immediately turned downward. The floating crowd rose up to exit, and even more large households and currency dealers tended to sell their loan goods. Soon, it fell sharply by 100 yuan, and the cash firm sold 50 taels to the silver shop, for 5,350 yuan. The silver shop suddenly took the opportunity to drag it up sharply, and at the same time, gold firms and currency dealers also rushed to buy it back, raising it again by 70 yuan. The silver shop bought 50 taels from the currency dealer, for 5,420 yuan. In the end, because the foreign exchange rate still reported a rebound, there were fewer and fewer buyers following the trend, and on the contrary, more and more people sold for profit, finally falling back by 65 yuan. The silver shop sold 50 taels to the currency dealer, for 5,355 yuan. Subsequently, the silver shops did 50 taels of mutual trading for 5,358 yuan as the noon closing price. As a result, it fell back 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of cash firm's own brand gold sold was several yuan higher than the black market price, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The cash price was more than 50 yuan lower than the posted price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Returned to Flat After Rising</p>
<p>The initial price of gold jewelry sold per tael in silver shops was still 540 yuan at Datonghang. It rose by 5 yuan at 9:30, fell back by 5 yuan at 10:20, and rose again by 5 yuan after 11 o'clock. At noon at 12 o'clock, it returned to 5 yuan lower again. There were no changes after that. As a result, it was flat. The Datonghang was still at 540 yuan. The new banks had the same price as above, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>American Dollars Rose and Fell Sharply. The Difference Between the High and Low for the Whole Day Was 5 Jiao.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was unpredictable. Initially, due to the continued sharp fall in the pound price, the black market US dollar exchange rate broke the tightest price on August 11 last year and found a new tight price of 6.0625 yuan, which was unprecedented. As a result, the US dollar bill suddenly rose to 16 yuan and 6 jiao. Later, because everyone generally believed that the pound price would turn around today, speculators scrambled to sell US dollars, and the US dollar bill followed suit, falling back to 16 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen at noon, and further falling to 16 yuan and 1 jiao in the afternoon. The British gold bill fell first and then returned to flat. The British, American, and gold pound rose sharply with the gold price first, and then fell accordingly. The Hong Kong bill was slightly weaker following the Hong Kong exchange rate. The supply of Singapore bills, Canadian bills, Robbie bills, and others was not weak. The Dutch bill trended stronger due to HSBC's exchange rate reducing by another one-half. The supply of Japanese gold bills was still large, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 0.006. The trend of Korean bills was still strong, and the evening market was 1 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were: the British, American, and gold pound each fell by 5 jiao, the US dollar bill fell by 5 fen, the Hong Kong bill fell by 1 fen, Singapore and Canadian bills both fell by 2 jiao, the Robbie bill fell by 1 jiao and a half, and the Dutch bill rose by 1 jiao. The rest were unremarkable.</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Jumps Over Two Yuan at Once. Wuxi Rice Market to Watch Japanese Movements. Shanghai Foreign Rice Rises Back Six or Seven Yuan. Over 90,000 Bags of Australian Wheat Will Arrive in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>Since the rice market turned from falling to rising within this week, it has been rising every day. Yesterday, it continued to show a surprising rise, and the prices of various foreign rice increased by more than two yuan. Although the thousand-market slightly recovered, compared to the price of 37-38 yuan when it was low in the previous week, it has risen by as much as 6-7 yuan within this week, indicating the drastic changes in rice prices. The reason for this rice price rebound is that the large batch of futures for this month has been cleared after a small-scale rush, so the source of foreign rice suddenly became scarce. Although the futures for the next month (i.e., April) will be shipped again next month, it will still take at least ten days at the fastest, and the number is less than half of the amount for this month, only about 200,000 bags. It is also heard that no renewals have been made for May, so the arrival of the later batch can be estimated. As a result, all spot owners have no intention of selling quickly. The goods in the hands of the current travelers were cut sharply at the time of the previous sharp fall for fear of suffering a great loss. The stores' reserves were also dry due to the repeated downstream movement of the market in the past, with more sales than purchases. Sellers did not sell, buyers thought of buying, and a change in market sentiment has formed. Therefore, yesterday morning, driven by this environment, the local stores asked prices from each other at the beginning of the market, and they competed to search for goods. Under the bullish sentiment of merchants, the market rose by one yuan immediately. No. 1 Saigon was sold for 42.5 yuan, and then more inland merchants entered the market one after another, and the situation became more bullish. The shout-outs rose one after another, and the market rose step by step. By the time the prices of various goods in the middle market seemed to climb the stairs, increasing to about 2.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was sold for 44 yuan, No. 2 for 40 yuan and 5 jiao, fire-twisted rice for 42 yuan, special Micro Party for 43 yuan, small twisted rice for 39 yuan and 7 jiao, No. 2 retired dimension for 40 yuan, and Tokyo sharp tip for 40 yuan. After this peak, it was inevitably too much of a shock, and the sales market gradually slackened. Until the noon market, the prices of various foreign rice fell back by half a yuan, which was actually about two yuan more than the previous market. For the rest, such as japonica, glutinous, and national rice, the arrival of goods from Hongkou was scarce, only more than 1,000 bags, and the sales were good. The market price was 20 yuan, and it was heard that the off-market prices for thick and thin japonica were 46-47 yuan for Kunxi japonica, 46 yuan for Qingzi special thin, 45 yuan for the bulk market, and 44-45 yuan for Nanhang early and late rice.</p>
<p>Following the upward trend of the previous day's rebound in foreign rice, the price soared, and it was difficult to approach. The Chinese and foreign traders had little stock and were unwilling to sell easily with the increasing price. Currently, No. 1 Saigon has risen all the way from 42 yuan to 44 yuan, which is about 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day. Other rice flours have also followed suit, rising by more than 1 yuan and 2-3 yuan respectively. The original package price of futures was also increased by more than 1 yuan. The initial opening price of No. 1 Saigon was 50.5 yuan, then to 51 yuan, and No. 2 was from 48 yuan to 48.5 yuan. Mizuluo was from 44 yuan to 44.3 yuan, but in the afternoon, floating loose customers took advantage of the high price to sell, and the original package of No. 2 fell by half a yuan first. Other rice was also shouted down by 5-6 jiao to 1 yuan, which is due to the current abundance of foreign rice stocks, the small arrival of new goods, and the rumors of the opening of national rice, so the hearts of people inside and outside the industry are not stable. However, the transaction was quite good yesterday, with more than 8,000 bags of current rice and more than 700 tons of futures.</p>
<p>Wuxi's Jiaojin rice market has stopped selling Pingmi, and the source is quite abundant. The owners' thoughts have turned firm, and most of them are going to the warehouse and waiting for a price to sell. The market has slightly entered into the Japanese traders' purchases, and has also caused a small number of traders to purchase in succession, which is very concentrated, resulting in a demand that exceeds the supply. The price of rice and rice has tightened, and the price of high white japonica has risen from 25.35 yuan per stone to 26.35 yuan. The market price on the 26th has reached about 27 yuan, and the price has risen by more than one yuan in the past three days. The price of coarse japonica has reached more than 25 yuan, and the price of japonica rice has reached more than 13 yuan. The situation depends entirely on the movements of the Japanese traders. If they continue to purchase continuously, it will soon reach a high price of 30 yuan.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice can arrive today. The previous newspaper has reported that the manager of Java Company's Aagen Sacher (transliteration) is shipping 35,000 bags of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but was later changed to tomorrow (the 29th). It is now known that it can be imported this morning and is scheduled to stop at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Today, 4,000 bags of foreign rice and more than 5,000 bags of corn will be transported to Yantai. It is also heard that a large batch of Australian wheat will arrive in Shanghai. It is loaded on the Bellng (transliteration) ship managed by the head of the foreign ship of Qiahe Foreign Company, totaling 9,200 tons, which is about 92,000 bags. It is said that it is loaded in bulk, not in bags, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Both Turn Stable. Xiyi Flour Prices Rise.</h3>
<p>Flour: The market gradually stabilized yesterday. The price of No. 2 flour mill has been fixed at 13.8 yuan, and it is unlikely to change for a while. The willingness to sell in various mills is still good, so the customer price of Green Cannonball brand is still at a high of 15 yuan, but the customer demand is flat and there are not many transactions. The recycled flour of Lao Cannonball brand is trading at 13.66 yuan, which is slightly tighter than before. In the environment of expensive gold and reduced exchange rates, those who hold goods intend to hold on to it, so the market is likely to brew again.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market has also stabilized. Due to the continuous rise in gold and reduction in exchange rates, the price of foreign wheat is high, and the owners intend to raise prices, but the intake of various factories is normal and there are few inquiries from customers, so the market has been stagnant. It is heard that more than 1,000 bags of Su, Chang and other wheat have been traded in the after-market, and the selling price has not changed significantly.</p>
<p>Wuxi: The wheat stock is low and the source is scarce, which has become the tail end. It once fell to 32.35 yuan. The market on the previous day was short of samples, and the price of each bag rose by 1 yuan. Flour mills and retail investors traded to the 34 yuan mark. The price of flour in the previous few days was as low as 11.7-8 yuan per bag, and some Shanghai retail customers moved to raise the price to 12.3-4 yuan. The price of period flour has reached 12.6-7 yuan, which is 5-6 jiao higher than before.</p>
<h3>Securities: Jardine Matheson's Dividend Unexpected. Domestic Debt Actively Resurfaces.</h3>
<p>Securities Black Market: Yesterday, the market rose sharply, so there were quite a few rumors. In practice, it was completely raised by covering short positions. Furthermore, with the approach of the Category C lottery, no one dared to take risks and buy back. The so-called issuance of treasury bills and government bonds is actually meaningless. In the current high tide of gold and foreign exchange, coupled with increasingly rampant rumors, such an unexpected rise in government bonds is inevitable to create opportunities for short sellers. Yesterday morning, Lianhe continued to cover short positions, and Changji also bought in quite enthusiastically. Nos. 14 and 41, as well as Dada, all had inflows, either covering short positions or searching for goods. Although Jiu Feng, Heng Tai, Wu Yuan, Yongkang, and others continued to sell, Category C penetrated the 9 yuan mark again. In the afternoon, Lianyi continued to hedge, Wu Yuan recovered again, and Tongsheng, Tiansheng, Lianyi, and others all had inflows. Xingyuan, Yitai, Tongkang, and other items were sold, and the market price rose again. Category E also penetrated the 9 yuan mark. As a result, it rose 0.3-0.6 yuan compared to the previous day, and the turnover was about 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 500 shares of Tianyuan Caustic Soda Factory were traded at a price of 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Public Securities Exchange, near the closing of the market, it was heard that Jardine Matheson announced a final dividend of 4 yuan per share (totaling 5 yuan including the previous interim dividend of 1 yuan), and the public's interest was almost concentrated on this point, and there was a general disregard for other items. This dividend exceeded the speculation of the general public, so the stock rose instantly, rising from a price of 44.25 yuan to 45.5 yuan. Although there were also many people who took profits in the meantime, the price finally stabilized, but due to the short time, the public obviously had no time to estimate the true value of this interest for the stock, otherwise its activity would be more than this. The general market situation was stable and the prices were stable. The trend of China Reclamation stocks was active, and the operators are also paying close attention to this. Rubber stocks were quiet, and Ranggezhi had more trading.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Spring Sales Begin.</h3>
<p>Current Yarn Morning Opening: Due to the sharp reduction in British and American exchange rates, sentiment was enthusiastic. The price of 20s Double Horse yarn for this month was 1,038 yuan, and the price for April was 1,050 yuan, rising directly to 1,060 yuan. Midway, because it had risen a lot in these few days, profit-takers came out, and it fell back by more than ten yuan, but the amount absorbed by the outside industry was still unwilling to give up. The turnover statistics for half a day totaled 2,563 bales. The market price of 20s Double Horse spot increased by 21 yuan. The amount purchased by various gangs is listed as follows: Same Industry 2,060 Hong Kong 48 Mainland 120 Statistics 2,563</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Also Rise by Two Yuan.</h3>
<p>The cotton trade continued to be active. Due to the good yarn market and the sharp reduction in foreign exchange rates, the same industry's sentiment was slightly firm. However, due to the tight money supply, the cotton market could not rise as much as the yarn market. The factories were also not buying much, but some factories were swapping yarn and cotton with cotton numbers, so the market turnover was not reported. Cotton prices rose by 1-2 yuan compared to the previous day. The current cotton situation is listed on the left: General bale 214.00 213.00 Same Industry purchased 315 pieces of Beita 212.00 Xinsheng purchased 500 bales of Grass bale 196.50 Same Industry purchased 187 bales of Fire Bale 204.20 Same Industry purchased 187 pieces of Pingguoer 187.00 Same Industry purchased 100 pieces of General bale 213.00 212.00 Chengfu purchased 200 pieces of Hai Huo Ji 207.00 Same Industry purchased 100 pieces of Donggou bale 204.00 Same Industry purchased 119 pieces of Beita 210.00 Same Industry purchased 400 bales of Da Zhonghua 228.00 Same Industry purchased 120 bales</p>
<p>Another Message: Foreign cotton market prices. The New York cotton market opened soft yesterday morning due to the drop in Liverpool's electricity newspaper, and then continued to fall due to the in-market covering sales of Southern gangs and the sales of overseas cotton traders. As a result, the closing price was 13-14 pounds of sound for the near-term and 20 pounds of sound for the far-term. The Indian cotton market fell again yesterday, with a forecast decline of 6 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 pounds of sound.</p>
<h3>Market Situation Summary</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market has appeared active in terms of trading activity. Although the overall situation is stable, prices have quietly eased quite a bit. Yesterday, Xiamen-based oil mills and others inquired about high-quality soybeans, which helped keep prices at their original levels. Medium and lower grades, however, inevitably suffered price cuts, falling by five or six cents compared to the previous day. Transactions included 150 bags of Nanjing beans at $20, three cartloads of Bengbu beans at $23 to $22.80, 130 bags of Anqing beans at $22.50, and over 800 bags of Wuhu beans at prices ranging from $24 to $21.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market remained sluggish, with prices continuing to fall by $2.50. Overall, prices at the place of origin have dropped, and local inventories are quite high, leading to a pessimistic outlook. The scope of trading in the market was limited, making it difficult to generate interest. Only 250 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at $110 to $109.50, 20 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil at $107.50, and 300 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at $76.</p>

<h3>Old News Re-Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (337) (See the Shenbao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Distinguishing the Way of the Gods (2)</p>
<p>The way of the gods is distant, while the way of humans is near. If drought persists for several years, the gods of the state should certainly be responsive. There's no need to pray to them. Praying at the Temple of Guan Yu suggests that a great god possesses great virtue and can turn a great heart to save the people. However, the people of Jin should not all have to die. Rainfall will come without prayer. If the people of Jin are destined to perish, what can even Guan Yu do? Given Guan Yu's holiness and ability to assist in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, he should summon the Rain Master to bestow abundant moisture, ensuring a successful harvest for the spring wheat. If rain only comes after prayer, isn't this using the divine power to seek the glory of a plaque? This is a grave slander. The celestial realm is clear and empty, the Earth rotates, and rain, sunshine, wind, and dew are all produced by air. Heaven has no intention of causing disasters, and the gods have no merit in bringing rain. However, the timing of Heaven is rooted in human affairs, and the saying "harmony brings auspiciousness" may have some basis. If there is good governance above and good customs below, harmony will lead to timely rain and wind. Therefore, relying on the way of the gods is illogical, while relying on human effort has a certain principle. When the Governor of Zhili entered Shanxi, the disaster was already established and impossible to reverse. To this day, the original officials still don't know to blame themselves and even embezzle disaster relief funds to enrich their families. One can only imagine the usual governance, education, orders, and commands. Attributing human wrongdoing to Heaven is like saying the gods are aware and send down sweet rain. This uses the gods as an excuse, and the cause of the disaster can also be blamed on celestial changes. However, many people are foolish, and those in power use divine gifts to confuse them, making them fear divine might and strive to be good. This is a subtle tactic of governance. But those in power should not entirely rely on the gods and excuse their own faults. In discussing this, I do not dare to consider the way of the gods as empty or the worship of gods as absurd. If one carefully examines the principles, one should recognize that my words are not intended to be unconventional.</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>The New Family</h3>
<p>— De Fu</p>
<p>The family is the earliest form of social organization for mankind. It arises naturally based on basic and shared human needs. Later, ethics and laws respecting the family merely officially acknowledged a fact with great influence. Because the family did not wait for artificial help to appear.</p>
<p>Family relationships, except for a very few unfortunate individuals, are simply a stage that everyone must go through in life. If someone loses their parents at a young age, has no siblings, and does not marry in adulthood, they have never enjoyed the happiness of a family. That is truly a great regret in life. If someone goes through the family stage but does not know how to derive the happiness they should, that can be considered a tragedy in life.</p>
<p>Now, the large family system is gradually collapsing due to changes in the social environment. Almost all young people living in cities practice small family life. As a result, a very common misconception has arisen in society that the center of a small family is the couple. In fact, this is not the case. Families, whether large or small, new or old, should be centered on children. Couples are merely the starting point of the family. If we do not recognize this goal, we will easily fall into selfishness. We will not only neglect the highest task of the family but may also lose the happiness of the family. Walter Lippmann put it well: "The love between a couple cannot last if they cannot jointly love many other things besides loving each other." In other words, the love between a couple is maintained by common interests. The more common interests, the better. The greatest common interest is the parental love, and the children's innocence and purity give parents a lot of spiritual comfort. Even some families on the verge of breaking up are maintained by the loveliness of their children. Then, the children are truly worthy of being the center of the small family.</p>
<p>For a family centered on children, the primary task is to allow the children to gain the experience of love. Parents must first respect and love each other. Even if they sometimes disagree, they should not conflict in front of their children. They must ensure that the children learn the example of love from their parents' behavior. Secondly, parents—especially fathers—must set aside a certain amount of time to give directly to their children. During this time, they can participate in various aspects of their lives. They can be close companions in games, reading, and friendships without the slightest sense of separation. In addition, parents should not easily scold or reprimand their children. Even if they make mistakes, they should not be disciplined in front of others, which would hurt their self-esteem. They should only explain their mistakes in a calm manner after their anger has subsided and give them warnings.</p>
<p>Although children occupy the central position in the family, they should not be considered the ultimate goal of the family. The ultimate goal of the family is to create a miniature of a democratic society and implement democratic civic training. If we recognize that democracy is the path the world should take, we must start with the family. The following points are worth noting for parents:</p>
<p>(1) The moral standards in the family should be jointly observed by parents and children. There should never be double standards. Children should not smoke or drink, and adults should first quit. We hope that children will keep their promises, and we should first not break our promises. In other words, parents must always lead by example. As the saying goes, "If he is upright, he will be followed even without orders. If he is not upright, he will not be followed even with orders."</p>
<p>(2) The treatment of men and women in the family should be based on the spirit of equality. The bad habit of valuing men over women should be strictly avoided.</p>
<p>(3) Family work should be assigned to children from an early age according to their abilities. This approach can enable children to recognize the sacred meaning of work and train their ability to divide labor and cooperate. Both of these are closely related to children's future participation in a larger society.</p>
<p>(4) If the family employs servants, parents and children should treat them kindly and be grateful for their help. They should not be arbitrarily shouted at or scolded, and they should also try to help them improve and have a more fulfilling life. This can enable children to develop a proper attitude and proper relationship toward workers from an early age.</p>
<p>(5) When children's intelligence has developed to a certain extent, efforts should be made to involve them in family council meetings. Larger issues include the family budget and children's school enrollment. Smaller issues include bedtime and meal times and the furnishing of the living room. All of this can train children to develop reasonable opinions and increase their ability to cooperate. (Payment)</p>

<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yu</p>
<p>"Teachers only give us instructions, but the achievements are still up to ourselves." Therefore, the target of students' criticism should not be teachers but themselves, and there is no need to be overly concerned about teachers' learning and character. To be able to understand anyone is the best learning!</p>
<p>A resume is only part of experience. People with higher status are not necessarily the most knowledgeable. Those who teach seriously are good teachers! The way to express learning is not just oral. The way to acquire learning is not just "listening"!</p>
<p>A teacher's views and knowledge may not be something that one can accept. Blindly following will lead to failure, but one's own thoughts can also incorporate the opinions of others. Common insights can be promoted and expanded through mutual discussion.</p>
<p>Teachers can help you acquire knowledge and discover your hidden talents, but they cannot inject knowledge into you or recreate you!</p>
<p>Teachers are others, you are yourself!</p>

<h3>Pre-War Advice</h3>
<p>— By Breekenridge, Translated by Pinpin</p>
<p>—— Advice from an Army Chaplain</p>
<p>Soldiers and compatriots: Tonight may be the last time we meet. We march together, we share the dangers of combat, the troubles of retreat; we equally endure hardship and hunger, the sabotage of internal traitors, the oppression of external enemies. We sit by the same campfire every night, eat the same dry rations; we hear the reveille together and we work hard, hear the retreat and weary soldiers rest, with the earth as our bed and our knapsacks as our pillows.</p>
<p>Now, soldiers and brothers, we meet, in this peaceful valley, on the eve of battle, as the sunlight is fading from behind that mountain. That very sunlight will glitter tomorrow on a sea of blood.</p>
<p>Only for one day can our land lie in such peaceful sunlight! The green forest is so quiet, the ancestral cottages are emitting green smoke, and golden wheat fields dot the surrounding wilderness. The pleasant music of human voices awakens the silence of the forest. Now, merciful God, look at this change! By means of unreasonable pretexts, falsely invoking God's holy name, and asking for the Savior's help, that foreign race is slaughtering our people! They plunder our cities, they destroy our fields, and now they are surrounding our camp outside this quiet valley.</p>
<p>I know that you can be strengthened by God's blessing. Tomorrow, when you join the battle, you will be at peace and determined. In the hour of battle, the surroundings will be dim, and only the pervading cannon fire and fierce gunfire will flash. The dead will lie across your feet. Remember, soldiers, God is with you, the eternal God helps you fight; He drives on the clouds of war, He drives the warriors to fight in the storm. The terrible God, the invincible God, helps you fight, and you will be victorious.</p>
<p>"Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword."</p>
<p>You also wield swords, but your hearts are not for hegemony and tyranny. You wield swords for your homes, your laws, your children. You wield swords for truth, justice, and fairness; you will surely have joyous rewards. Your enemies wield swords to destroy what people love and to desecrate God; they will die by the sword.</p>
<p>Now, brothers and soldiers, I must bid you farewell. Many of us will die in battle tomorrow—may God grant peace to the souls of the dead!—Many of us may live to tell the story of tomorrow's battle, and the memory of this autumn night will linger in our minds. When we meet again, may the shadows of the evening sun shine on a free land.</p>
<p>May God bless their victory!</p>
<p>(September 10, 1777, during the American War of Independence)</p>

<h3>Great Friendship</h3>
<p>— Liu Daohong</p>
<p>Great and sincere friendship can transform a negative person into a positive one and a pessimist into an optimist. A person becomes negative and pessimistic not by nature but because they feel the coldness of the environment: society gives them pain and despair, and the treatment from relatives and friends is indifferent and harsh. Therefore, they cannot discover a happy and noble life, nor can they pursue a fulfilling life interest. How can this not make them tend towards negativity and pessimism?</p>
<p>However, fervent and sincere friendship is a raging fire that will burn away the root of your pain. When you enjoy great friendship, you will discover that this society is not as filled with coldness, indifference, and pain as you previously imagined. There are also springs of happiness in it; there are also comrades who share your joys, sorrows, and anger. You are not alone; yes, at this time, you will feel that life may have some meaning. Therefore, no longer be negative and pessimistic, and together with the friend who moves you and gives you sincere friendship, move forward on the journey of life. Although there are obstacles, they cannot stop your progress.</p>
<p>No one does not hope to obtain sincere friendship, but the bad habits and conventions of modern society restrict the generation of passionate friendship everywhere. The generation of pure and sincere friendship requires at least achieving a degree of straightforwardness and selflessness. But in today's world, where the toxins of selfishness, jealousy, and suspicion are deeply rooted in people's hearts, how easy is it to achieve selflessness and straightforwardness?</p>
<p>Millionaire tycoons, powerful officials, and versatile geniuses may say: With my power, influence, wealth, and ability, I don't need any friends, let alone friendship. But what kind of stimulation will they suffer when their family property is gone, they lose their official position, and they suffer from all kinds of diseases! At that time, if there are no sincere friends to comfort, encourage, and help, there is no better path than negativity, pessimism, and ultimately falling into depravity and suicide!</p>
<p>We should first discover sincere and fervent friendship because sincere and great friendship is the beacon that discovers a fulfilling and noble life!</p>

<h3>Hoping for More "Beautiful" Movies</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>If we start our discussion with last year's top box-office hit—"One Millionth Teacher"—we must all acknowledge that its extraordinary success and global praise as the "best" film is largely due to the success of the original story. Secondly, it is the director's style and the actors' superb acting skills. Sometimes, even with a good and fulfilling script, if there is no good director and good actors to perform it vividly and dynamically, that good script may be ruined. Indeed, an allegedly "good" film requires an unknown amount of brainpower, diligence, and hard work during the production process.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, crudely made films certainly exist, but generally speaking, their serious and progressive production spirit is indeed worth emulating by our Chinese film industry colleagues.</p>
<p>Mr. Huaerzi said in his discussion of "One Millionth Teacher" that domestic historical costume dramas seem to have a downward trend. Indeed, after domestic films shifted from "contemporary dramas" to "historical costume dramas," there has been a decline. As for movies that can be called "good," I can boldly say: very few!</p>
<p>What I hope is that we should all make movies for the sake of "movies." We have plenty of good movie scripts; we don't have to look in the historical pile. As long as we are all willing to work hard and speak up for the noble mission of movies, everything can be done. As the saying goes, "Where sincerity is, metal and stone will open!" How are good movies produced? It's because we can do our best.</p>
<p>From now on, I hope there will be more genuinely "good" movies like "One Millionth Teacher" and "Orphan's Paradise," whose scenes are not grand, appearing in Shanghai. We are eagerly waiting!</p>
<h3>Secrets Behind the Silver Screen – How to Do Sound Effects</h3>

<p>Rubbing thick paper against a rotating cylinder, and striking the cylinder with a belt on it, creates a sound similar to that of a motorcycle.</p>
<h3>Trends in the Theatrical World of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Meng Xiaodong's Popularity Spreads Through Nine Cities</p>
<p>At the beginning of his move north, Li Shaochun once caused a sensation in the old capital with Tan-school Lao Sheng operas. Now that Shaochun has left Ping to go elsewhere, Meng Xiaodong, the Kunqu opera veteran specializing in Lao Sheng roles who has been in retirement for a long time, has reappeared and formed a troupe to perform in Ping. Xiaodong's operas have always enjoyed a good reputation. When discussing today's Tan-school Lao Sheng actors, people often compare Xiaodong with Fu Ying. Moreover, Xiaodong's entry into Shu Yan's school has gained Shu Yan's favor. Whenever Xiaodong performs, Shu Yan supervises and directs, which further shows Xiaodong's importance. Xiaodong in Ping rarely agreed to appear. In contrast, now she performs once a week at the Xin Xin Theater. In general, Tan-school Lao Sheng actors all regard Xiaodong's performance as a daunting challenge. Yan Jupeng and Ma Lianliang and others can attract audiences with new operas. Tan Fuying, with his Tan-family style, specializes in old operas, and his repertoire is the same as Xiaodong's, so he regards Xiaodong as his only strong enemy. It is said that when Xiaodong performed "Search and Rescue the Orphan" at the Xin Xin Theater, the audience was 1,000 people. On the same night, Fu Ying performed a double bill of "Sangyuan Society" and "Picking the Tassel" at the Chang'an Theater, with only a little over 400 seats occupied. The ticket prices for both were the same, but Fu Ying's appeal was not as good as Xiaodong's. One can imagine how popular Xiaodong is in Ping.</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu's First Love Matures</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu returned north with a great reputation and became very popular in Tianjin and other places with the opera "Spinning Cotton." As a result, her momentum has been increasing recently, and her popularity is no less than that of Xue Yanqin in her prime. The romance between Suqiu and Wang Helin, a top student at the opera school, has long been an open secret, and recently it has become more openly a secret. It is said that Wu Suqiu has obtained her mother's consent, and she will hold a wedding with Wang in the short term. It is said that Wu plans to form a married couple troupe after the wedding. Wang Helin is the only Lao Sheng talent at the opera school and has become a student of Ma Lianliang. His singing and acting are both excellent, and recently he has also studied martial arts operas. Given Suqiu's popularity in recent years, if she can cooperate with Helin, it will be even more wonderful, and the performance of husband and wife on the same stage will also become a legend.</p>
<p>Veteran Actors Change Careers One After Another</p>
<p>Zhou Ruisheng is the Wusheng actor who most resembles Yang Xiaolou. In terms of experience and qualifications, he is far above Sun Yukun, Gao Shenglin, and others, but unfortunately, time does not allow it, and his age is increasing. Now Zhou is in his sixties. Although he still performs from time to time, his past masterpieces such as "Golden Leopard" and "Picking the Battle Car" are rarely performed. Recent news has come that Zhou has decided to abandon his current work and switch to performing Guan operas (i.e., old man operas). With Zhou's tall stature and loud voice, his performance of Guan operas will surely be wonderful. Moreover, famous Dan actors such as Ruxiang, also a grandmaster in the opera world, have recently switched to singing Lao Dan roles due to their aging and fading beauty. Ruxiang used to sing Lao Sheng roles in her early years, and because she has both a big voice and a small voice, she will surely be able to handle singing Lao Dan roles with ease.</p>
<p>Child star Ai Muqin has interesting toys. She is only ten years old, and her bones are flexible, so she can make various poses, preparing to dedicate her skills on the stage and silver screen.</p>
<h3>A Newcomer on the Stage – Chen Qi</h3>
<p>— Ye Hui</p>
<p>If the readers have seen the Chinese Travel Theater's performance of the Ibsen drama, and are not forgetful, they should remember that when the first act was just opened, a small song was sweetly transmitted from behind the stage to the ears of every concentrated and attentive audience member. Who was the singer of the song? It is Chen Qi, whom I am introducing now, who played Meiniang.</p>
<p>Her original surname is Chen, and her given name is Cuidi. She is nineteen years old, and her hometown is Ning County, Zhejiang. The year of the August 13 Incident was the year she graduated from the junior high school department of the Provincial Shangzhong School. In the fall of that year, the school resumed classes in the concession, and she was admitted to the senior high school business department for further study. Unexpectedly, she was suddenly expelled by the school last year because she joined the Sino-French Drama Society. The school believed that this would damage its reputation, so it had to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys and used strict expulsion measures. Therefore, she did not have the opportunity to study at the school again. Otherwise, this year would have been the time for her to complete her senior high school studies. Recently, she also made her debut in the film "Fragrant Concubine" produced by the United Film Company. I think that with her acting skills on the stage appearing on the silver screen, she probably won't disappoint.</p>
