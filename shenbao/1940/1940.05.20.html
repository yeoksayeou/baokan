<p>社評</p>
<h3>美蘇與今日之遠東</h3>
<p>據昨日電訊，英國方面刻正考慮派遣特別使節前往蘇聯，以謀促進英蘇關係；這雖是尙未證實的消息，却不禁令人迴想到一年前的此際，正是全世界人士都爲英蘇談判持久不決而感到絕大焦慮的時候。不幸以往事實的發展適與人們期望背道而馳，三國談判由遷延以致擱淺；代之而成立的到是蘇德間的互不侵犯協定，歐陸戰禍亦遂至於無可避免。這一頁慘苦的敎訓，說明了任何戢止侵略的企圖必須高瞻遠矚，當機立斷，絕不容依違兩可，蔽於成見；致終貽噬臍之悔。</p>
<p>現在歐陸已在兵連禍結之中，其範圍延及全歐三分之一的國家，其來勢則較之前次大戰尤爲險惡。目前雖納粹德國顯佔優勢，而最後勝負尙非一時進退所能斷定，英方即使眞在從事對蘇棄嫌修好的醞釀，其意義已遠非去年三國談判所能比擬。這除了靜視其推移而外，更不必多事批判。而歐陸之外，遠東猶在震撼未已之秋；如果在歐洲方面，一切亡羊補牢的計畫已無足輕重，則對於太平洋上未來局勢的幻變，正有作未雨綢繆考慮的必要。</p>
<p>日來因荷蘭本土被侵而實現緊張的東印情况，似已復趨緩和，英美法荷以及日本，都發出維持荷印現狀的聲明；另一方面，最爲中外人士所關懷的上海現狀，近頃亦因美國艦隊長官赫德的賢明措置而杜絕了野心者的覬覦。綜觀此種種演進，似乎西太平洋方面可能苟安一時，暫不致引起重大紛擾。這種事實，固不必加以無謂的揣測；但在手綰世界機運的政治家，則斷不容僅以苟安現狀爲已足，必須能見微知著，採取機先措置，俾防患於無形。就年餘以來美蘇雙方的運用來看，有如美方對美日商的的廢止，太平洋的海軍大操，以及關於九國公約一再所發的聲明；又如蘇方對於中國抗戰的慷慨支援，應付日方態度的堅定，凡此舉措，美蘇兩國都算是盡到相當任務了。今日雖然歐陸列强已捲入戰爭漩禍，而在妄的日閥主今仍未敢任情橫行，爲所欲爲者，一方固然是中國抗戰之功，另一方面，也未嘗小是由於美蘇雙方的牽制。然而要遏制侵略，安定遠東，則已有的這些努力顯然還很不夠。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國，雖在遠東具有同樣的立塲和利害關係，而雙方運用却是各行其是，互不相侔，不只缺乏諒解與合作，反而在雙方之間儼然存在一種相互疑忌的微妙姿態。縱蘇芬戰事停止已久，此種嫌隙，迄今尙未消除。這是遠東國際局勢的一大弱點，也就是在未來演變中最可顧慮的一件事。日閥曾經屢次利用此一罅隙，以其矯揉造作的「親」「反」姿態反覆運用於蘇美之間，雖其結果，迄今毫無所獲，而此後未必不再利用適當時機，重施此種技倆，使各國交受其敝，况美蘇對遠東的現行政策，保障現狀雖有餘。預防禍變尙不足。際此英法對於德國猛烈攻勢應付維艱，地中海形勢又復險惡萬分，美國的參加歐戰遲早恐難避免，則對於遠東方面正不能不早做進一步的準備。假如歐洲戰禍一旦波及美國西太平洋的均勢將有再被打破之虞；那一前途正是日閥虎視眈眈以期待着的，彼時必不免重以咄咄逼人的姿態向英美法蘇橫施危脅；所謂荷印一類問題，也必然復趨嚴重。這種可能，正隨着歐戰的危機而增長着，現在說不定已是最後的時機，列强如不從速覓取預防的措置，則將不免重蹈歐局惡化的覆轍。</p>
<p>爲了戢止野火的蔓延，防範未來的變亂，美蘇間的協調與合作是最有效最切要的途徑。固然，直到最近，此二國間尙無接近的徵象，甚至心理上的隔閡也未見末减。這種不幸的情勢，不容任其拖延。原來政制的歧異，思想的不同，都不是阻止兩國政策合作的理由，比起人類因侵略而遭受的慘禍，這些問題眞是太渺小了！納粹德國爲了某種利益可以一變而與共產主義的蘇聯携手，這種氣魄是値得民治國家效倣的。試看日前英國國會中對於去年三國談判失敗一慕的責難，便可瞭然於今日在遠東組織反侵略共同行動的如何切要。無論是爲了美蘇自身的利益，抑我爲了西太平洋大局的前途，都需要美蘇間的合作。美蘇間倘能合作，即使歐戰再度擴大，則遠東方面這一聯合的力量仍足以控制裕如。不然則除却中國自身不難以日益增長的實力終於獲得獨立自由而外，整個的太平洋局勢必將依然難於樂觀。這一點，是全世界明達之士所應深切考慮的。</p>

<h3>戰局極端嚴重　法閣局部改組　並調動外交人員增活動力　貝當以協理資格襄贊軍務</h3>
<p>巴黎　萊諾總理今晚發表廣播演說、宜佈內閣局部改組情形、同時並報吿德機械化部隊在末斯河南面突入法國陣地之後、本日又已稍有進展、其霄有曰、「政府之職責端在行動、人民所期望於政府者亦爲實際的行爲、而非空洞的言論、時至此日、吾人所念念不忘者、厥爲士兵之犧牲·與其家屬之痛苦·難民之顚沛流離·以及受敵方空襲之無辜平民、吾國民挨處此重大情狀之下、輒能不顧具個人之痛苦而共赴國難、此實法蘭西民族偉大之處、余曾於昨日向諸君報吿、德國機械化部隊業在末斯河南面突入吾國境內、並在吾軍陣地內造成一突出點、迄至本日、此突出點又已向西略見進展、此際局勢確甚吃緊、但並非絕望、余意目下正爲法國民族一顯身手之時期、職是之故、吾人決定將內閣局部改組、俾克充實力量第一、「凡爾登勝利者」貝當上將今晨自西班牙京城返抵此間之後、業已加人內閣、担任協理兼不官部閣員、今後必能大展宏才襄贊軍務、以達最後勝利之目的、第二、在現行情勢之下、內閣總理必須祖負國防責任、是以余自即日起兼任國防總長兼陸軍部長、而以達拉第君調任外長、芒台爾君調任內長、（芒台爾乃已故老虎總理克萊蒙梭之高足、第三、政府決定調動外交人員以增强效力、其名單當在短時期內予以發表、一言以蔽之、吾國各機關必須一律適應戰時需要、戰爭精神必須高於一切、凡屬國民不論服務軍中或供職後方、皆應努力奮鬥、誓必擊敗敵人」云（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間政界人士對於內閣局部改組事、其對於駐西班牙大使貝當上將人閣、曁殖民部長芒台爾調任內長兩層、尤爲贊許、良以貝當上將（現年八十四）乃上次歐戰名將、今後以內閣協理兼不管部閣員之資格贊襄軍務自可一展長才、至芒台爾則素以堅決果斷著稱、調任內長之後、定可以最大之毅力、對付所謂「第五縱隊」之內奸也、（哈瓦斯十八日電）</p>

<p>巴黎　法國駐敎廷大使魯氏、調任外交部秘書長一事、頃由外交界人士加以評論、萊諾總理昨晚發表廣播演說時、曾以調動外交人員、增强效力爲言、此舉殆其發軔、且自魯氏與駐西班牙大使貝當上將相繼調回之後、其他重要外交官、亦將有所調動、按新任秘書長魯氏、熟悉中歐各項政治問題、厥後駐敎廷大使任內、敎廷與法國關係、極爲親睦、彼此對於保衛人類特性與民族獨立權利、咸具共同信念、此項信念、敎皇庇護十二世曾於去年十二月間、重行予以道及、萊諾總理最近亦曾以「保衛拉丁民族與基督敎文明」爲言、蓋法義兩國文明具有此種共同特點、義國所由猶豫而不與德國異敎徒爲伍、其故即在於此云、（十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>德方綜述　戰事情勢　——從挪戰說起——</h3>
<p>柏林　據軍事當局負責人士向海通社叙述第三十七週戰况如下當德軍駐防挪威那維克港之際、英法聯合自南北來攻、經一月之久、德軍奮勇應戰、擊退英法聯軍及挪戚軍向北潰退、而德軍完全佔領挪威中部及北部、北部英地及那維克相距爲二百七十基羅米突、那維克德軍得空軍協助致獲成功、而於該星期內英艦泊於那維克者、有驅逐艦一艘及運輸艦三艘被擊中沉沒、而另有巡洋艦二艘及驅逐艦二艘皆被炸傷、那維克之港口全被毀壞、而那維　至瑞典前錢之鐵軌亦經破壞、德軍於五月十日開始攻擊西綫盧森堡極南起至北海之依蒙斯江口、該綫長的四五〇基羅米突、盧森堡於一日內完全佔領、荷蘭亦相繼而下、數日後比利時亦落於德軍手中、而戰綫延至魯文、及那穆爾、</p>
<p>五月十六日德軍先後共佔領荷蘭六七·〇〇〇方公里、比利時及盧森堡各五〇·〇〇〇方公里、而德軍向西綫推進之綫、自四五〇公里縮短爲二五〇公里矣、</p>
<p>當德軍繼續攻佔末斯河及色當侵入法國之北部、比利時於該河岸建築現代化堅强砲量及列日之最强固工事、雖然皆入聯軍手中、然聯軍並未能予比荷之助、荷蘭軍隊南翼失去比軍北翼之聯絡、於是荷軍終於五月十四日投降德國矣、德國空軍發揮其威力、從事保護德軍北翼、同時對荷蘭南海岸之央國軍隊加以轟炸、首六日內德空軍炸沉敵艦多艘、同時德空軍飛往箝制英國協助荷蘭之軍隊及英法聯電協助比利時、德空軍遂與敵機發生空戰於荷比法境內、擊落敵機有三四百架、另外德國以傘兵降落於比荷飛機塲內、故洛特丹及盎凡爾斯浦得以佔領、德軍遂以最新武器而將比利時第一砲台依本—依麥爾佔領、而德空軍協助那穆爾北部之坦克部隊及機械化部隊進攻敵軍、此乃五月十三日之戰况也、</p>
<p>五月十四十五兩日德軍渡越末斯河那穆細　南部及法國北部之色當、德　向法軍猛攻、卒將法軍擊退、於色當南部法軍以九十噸坦克參戰、據彼等視爲如此重兵器，當無所敵、但終以德國空軍之威力脅迫退出戰塲、</p>
<p>當首六日之戰事、德空軍有顯著之戰績、德空軍先後擊落敵機一千三百五十架至一千五百架之衆、後來數日敵機傷亡較少、蓋德空軍又至敵之後方轟炸矣、</p>
<p>此後敵方將於盎凡爾斯·萊爾河·那穆爾·末斯河東岸·色當·展開決戰、而今蒂爾綫業經突破、梅朗魯凡及白魯塞爾皆已佔領、而法軍進攻已受阻礙、馬奇諾綫及末斯河兩地戰况、當可深察德軍進展之勢云、（十九日海通電）</p>

<h3>德廢皇　仍居荷境</h3>

<h3>美物價繼續慘跌　投機家自食其果　歐戰阻塞運銷仍須傾瀉投機家已虧損五千餘萬</h3>
<p>本埠一般投機家、自戰事發生後、大事購買外匯及外國股票、並囤積來自歐美之物品、自歐戰爆發後、若輩投機目標、又復轉移於囤積美國貨物、並購買美國股票與美匯、邇來美匯連續猛長、彼等已虧損不少、兼之外匯鬆長、影響物價傾跌尤大、故此輩投機家之厄運、屋漏又逢連夜雨、因美國境捏股票犬跌、物價續落、以致更遭嚴重打擊、而蒙鉅大虧損、至上星期五止、上海資力雄厚之各大投機商、單就美國股票與物價傾跌中、彼等至少虧損達二千萬元以上、</p>
<p>股票物價繼續慘跌</p>
<p>昨據平明社記者探悉本埠某　外商方面又接電訊、上星期六美國紐約市塲之股票及物價、繼續爆跌、截至前日（星期六）止、美國各種股票、平均下跌已共達百分之二十左右、跌風最鉅之股票、有至百分之四十以上者、甚至軍火工業股票、亦呈跌勢、至於一般物品市價、不論其如何種類、平均普跌至百分之二十、</p>
<p>華人遭受空前損失</p>
<p>因此上海一般華人大投機家所蒙之虧損、又已不止二三千萬元、據本埠著名外商企業金融機關之估計、至少在美金三百萬元左右、約合國幣達五千四百萬元之譜、彼等雖曾於黑匯美滙六元市價時、曾獲厚利、今竟遭此打擊、已得不償失矣、而上海華商投機家、虧損若是之鉅、實為僅見、但亦因上海華商之從事投機囤積、亦求有如今日之盛者、且美國物價傾跌、其他外貨以至中國土貨市價其勢亦將一蹶不振、故此次本埠大小投機家之損失、為數極鉅、</p>
<p>傾瀉原因繫於歐戰</p>
<p>至於美國股票與物價傾跌原因、（一）股票慘跌、由於歐戰影響、蓋美國各大企業普及全世界、而其產業與公司、亦滿佈各處、此次歐戰擴大、受到戰事影響之各分公司、必受相當損失、因之連帶及於本公司之股票價格、（二）物價傾瀉、亦因受戰事影響、蓋美國出口商品、向以亞洲歐洲為最大主顧、遠東方面戰事、正在繼續進行中、而歐戰又起、近且擴大、以致美國出口貿易、頓成停滯狀態、終至釀成貶價</p>

<h3>滬閩商務　逐步困難</h3>
<p>福州帮商人、在滬經贊進出口貨業者、計有五十餘家、中以雲章申莊·陳烯記·建康·先新·等規模為最大、在去年上半年以前、每月進口貨物、（運往福建者）值七百萬元之鉅、出口貨物、（由福建運滬者）亦在四百萬元左右、（按進口以洋布·棉紗·火油·為大宗、洋雜貨等次之、出口貨到以木材為大宗、）惟自去年下半年以來、營業銳减、進口貨物不及三百萬元、據該帮商人語平明社記者云、溯自</p>
<p>去夏以來</p>
<p>閩江口外、時有日艦扣留貨輪阻擾航行、甚或將貨沒收、因之、自去年下半年以來、所有通行閩滬貨輪、咸須繞道三都或興化、經過一星期之陸上運輸、故閩滬進出口貨運費、幾超原價三分之二、於是價格飛漲、營業衰落、此其一、再則邇來福州迭遭日機轟炸、居民紛紛疏散郊外、故需要减少、此其二、此外、邇來各輪船公司、一再增加水腳、如恰隆公司於</p>
<p>月前增加</p>
<p>水腳二成半、今又將增加二成半、致進出口貨價格飛漲、亦為營業衰落原因之三、又悉、近閩省當局、因防止日貨混人內地、對一切進口貨、均須預先登記、且布匹進口、須經上海市商會發給記明單、近因該項手續、福州帮商人正向市商會商洽中、未有結果、故上海布匹不能進口、已一月有奇矣、福州帮營業益見慘淡、</p>

<p>檢查案件已有多起</p>
<p>公衆對于日常用品之抬價過高、或度量衡上或貨質上發現有舞弊之事件、可向指定之六捕房報吿、故法租界對食品之監察甚嚴、經檢舉者、（一）肉類、販售水牛四十二起、販售二等肉類一起、其他二十九起、（二）飲料之偽造事件頗多、經處罰者、有用大批燃料、製造有色產物、以Medoe牌上等葡萄酒名義出售者、被罰鍰五百元、有用下等酒精作Martel牌燒治名義發售、被飼鍰二百元、有販售來源不明之酒類、一罰三十五元、一罰五十元、現平準會正對因外滙緊縮、立將存貨價格抬高、而外滙放長後仍不抑價之商戶、加以澈查究辦、據平價會發表、自四月十五日至五月三日間、法警務處曾對於法租界各商人所用之度量衡、施行八十五處之檢查、而在此數中、計有二十三家商店、因使用偽造之度量衡而被處罰、其罰鍰為二十元至一百元、查法警務處在不法商人處所發覺之若干案件、計有量器之底、裝有木板或鉛塊、藉以减少容量、又有衡器鑿孔、以抑重量等等、該會甚望大衆加以注意、如有人發現此種違法事件時、應即向捕房報吿云、</p>

<h3>人力車夫的生活　我們應當寄予同情援助乘車時只不要過於計較</h3>
<p>— 爭青</p>
<p>天氣漸漸地熱了起來，大家都在忙着防疫，上海市人力車夫互助會也照例舉行夏令衛生會了。</p>
<p>這樣的集會，大約除了車夫圈裏的人以外，社會人士是不甚注意，自然更談不到興趣的；但是，這的確是一個值得重視的社會問題。且　以為他已經是落後的交通事業，在目前，他還是一個應該維護的純粹民族資本的企業啊！車，在公共租界有九千六百輛，在法租界約有一萬輛；車夫，在公共租界有四萬四千，在法租界有五萬以上。除開淪陷的南市，閘北不算，僅就兩租界裏，我們隨時隨地都可看見的相當十萬數目的車夫，（聞最近有很多回鄕耕田）在交通上，在苦力部門中，佔着偌大重要的數量，我們就絕對不能予以輕視；而當盡我們的心力，寄予同情和援助。這一點可說極其容易，當我們乘車時，只不要　意或無　的過於計較就得啦！您稍微抬一抬手，他們的生活，直接就受惠了。</p>
<p>假使您不嫌嚕囌，生活和衛生是一個問題的兩面，現在先把訪問的車夫生話談談。生　必須的四個字—衣·食·住·行，他們比您是打了一個對折，只須兩個字—食·住·而已。先談食：他們已經再無可簡單地兩隻手是常常代替着您的义·刀或筷，一手端着茶碗，一手拿着大餅，蹲在街頭，就完成您所謂的「麵包問題」了；這樣也要三角。倘使坐上飯攤，快快活活叫一盌黃豆芽，吃三碗飯，却叙半元。再經過消化作用，待到排洩，還需兩分。自然這只是個人生活。談到家，就連到住：就是您常常在報上看見的某角落火燒，燒去棚戶幾十，幾百，或千餘，這就是他們的家所在了。雖然住在他們或不以　嚴重，但他們的收入，除去個人和家人的食外，其餘還要擔負一點地租，也夠吃力。在那裏，荒蕪的草塲上，蓋着破陋的板篷，水，大家上午奔向太平龍頭依次取得一小鉛桶，蟲，蠶，一天二十四小時中無時不在向他們侵襲，沒家屬的，大夥合住一間，容膝難安。他們却安居在這種環境裏有四十餘年。</p>
<p>您用不着再聽下去，當然明自這種生活是怎樣衛生啦，對的，這種生活，眞不易談衛生。不過這種生活，是尤其需要衛生；否則易於病，更易於死！</p>
<p>由此我們可見互助會一年一辦衛生會，有其深長的意義。今年在麥根醫西區分會舉辦三天的結果，據顧主任對我說：</p>
<p>展覽：是分室陳列各種生理和病理的標本，模型，五彩圖畫，都很淺顯誘目：表演，電影，每天二次，關於傷寒，痢疾，腦膜炎·白喉，猩紅熱，痧子，天花，肺炎，百日咳，鼠疫，肺癆，瘧疾，回歸熱以及花柳病，自濁，寄生蟲等，都詳加解釋。啟導他們的認識，引起他們的注意，於是他們都要求打防疫針，種痘，大家忙作一團了。</p>
<p>最後一天，嬰孩比賽，是最有　味的一個尾聲。他們的妻，都懷抱着三子，六子，踴躍參加，在一百二十六個整潔的嬰孩中，檢騐得三個使意不信是生長　戶裏的白皙肥壯而且活潑的天使：</p>
<p>（一）孫大網子　八個月　廿一磅</p>
<p>（二）潘留保子　十一個月　廿二磅</p>
<p>（三）孫大根　五個月　十七磅</p>
<p>大網子的媽媽接受着獎品！一套絨衫褲，鞋，襪，糖菓和藥皂，一群人都嘻笑地包圍了她，給她慶幸，同時也給自己生羨；其餘都有糖菓分給；最劣的十二名，也各分送一瓶魚肝油和滋養品。我們回憶着年年「四四」，並不曾見到這麼親切的一慕！</p>
<p>公共租界現在還有車夫三高八千，我們看看上面參加人數不及四之一，因為有的還不瞭解這樁事，有的為生活作平馬走，抽不出閒來。希望該會一面勤於導說，一面積極推進車夫福利的事業，務期明年第七屆例會能獲更大的效益。</p>

<h3>外匯前途如何（三）</h3>
<p>— 夏芝</p>
<p>本文以當前情勢懸測外匯前途爲主、舉本刋二四四—五期「法幣前途如何」一文，以法幣本身展望其前途，有貫串性；後者雖二年期前作，但所論各點，絕未變化，目將永不變化，可以參讀。</p>
<p>本文共分十二節，將陸續分載本刋，茲先提示其綱目如次：</p>
<p>一，現在應該啞然失笑了（前期）　二，一金庫券一與平準基金（前期）</p>
<p>三，「限制提存」與盜案迭起（前期）　四，「不維持」比維持更難（上期）</p>
<p>五，中美滬兌合作之可能性（上期）　六，貿易入超與平凖基金（本期）</p>
<p>七，法幣金　備與在外資金（本期）　八，盧布馬克的破產眞相（本期）</p>
<p>九，「自然水準」與人爲水凖（本期）　十，外幣價値與投機利益（待續）</p>
<p>十一，歐戰擴大與美滙前途（上期）　十二，日僞搗亂之最大限度（待續）</p>
<p>歷來黑滙市塲之波動，人果皆知其爲一人心虛」，故易受種種造謠中傷者所鼓動；然則何以虛？不瞭解現實眞相而發生錯覺，」也；缺乏判斷能力而易受惑言包圍，二也；愛惜私財而不知保持具私財之合理方法，三也；投機者又各抱他人做，我何獨不做之心理，四也。故歷來事實雖無不將謠言紛碎，但每當謠言再起時，各人心理上竟又不克自主。故本文旨在提供種種有關滙市前途之種種基本事實，藉以帮助讀者增强其半斷力，俾人人在心理上有所準備。本應按各節程序順次發表，茲因歐戰擴大，美滙前途之變化，關係本市黑滙者尤深，故先將該節提早發表於上期，餘則仍按次刋載。</p>
<p>本文所述若干部份，曾於五月八日八仙橋靑年會宴直會席上演說時提及，因署名不同，恐滋誤會，　　言註明。</p>
<p>由於對外貿易事實上的大量入超，因此有不少人認爲「以有限的一千萬鎊滙兌平準基金，來維持無限的鉅大人超，總是悲觀的」。不少人百爲文討論其危機；像Finane＆Commeeree週報裏某君且指出：今年來黑滙市價的步跌，即由上海江海關大量入超的事實所造成；甚至表示他對於由貿易入超造成的黑滙跌勢，較投機者所造成的跌勢更危險。我們對於這位先生關心中國外滙的熱忱，萬分感謝；同時却希望他根據有關滙兌的全部事實來撤回他的這毬意見。作者素來欽佩這位先生的卓識與遠見，更敬佩他是在華外僑中對於中國經濟最有硏究的一人，作者拜讀過他小少大作，最欽佩他的是對於中國國際收支的平衡關鍵，不在貿易，而在貿易外的收支；像華僑滙款，外人（包刮商人，旅行者，官吏，軍隊等等）在華費用，國外證券之投資收益等。靠着這類收入來抵補貿易入超，固屬中國國際收支上的一大病態，而應努力增加生產來設法糾正他，但僅以貿易入超一項來判斷黑市滙價的前途，抺煞有利於黑滙的共他因素，未免小很客觀。</p>
<p>第二：關册上的進口値依照法定滙率計算，固應修正；但單純的依照黑滙價來修正進口貿易値，我們覺得也不甚切實。就國際收支觀點說：確實的進口支出値應依結進的滙價計算；在滙價穩定時期，結價與收貨的兩個時期上的進口値果然相差無幾，今日那就不然。雖則要用此法來修正海關數字是小可能的，但對於以當月份的黑滙價來修正的數字，也不能過於信任。小過：淪陷區內，尤其像上海等地方的貿易入超，確屬事實；貿易入超給予黑滙市塲的影饗，也無可否認。不過未必如一般人想像中那末大。</p>
<p>第三：黑滙市塲上的滙票來源，並非純屬平凖基金；也許還由上海游資所化身者居多。滙豐銀行售出的外滙並非都來自香港，而香港拋售的外滙又並非都來自中英平準基金；這是誰都可以想像得到的。投機份子的進出旣時時在替代平準基金的進出，那末以貿易入超額來測量平準基金的消耗量，結論當然與事實絕對不符了。何况平準基金的操作，斷非只出不進。只要不是日商或其他敗類，平準會在滙豐之外，儘可以再找代表向市塲上吸收，以爲未來放長的準備。試問你們過去跟着沙遜花旗等等後面扒，難道一定不是替自己投機目的掘墳墓嗎？</p>
<p>因爲法幣發行量的增加，因爲地方券又在部份實行，因爲對外貿易的長期入超，因爲黑滙市價總是縮得快而鬆得慢，因爲抗戰資材的不斷需要等等，於是一般人幾乎把政府收支當做一對小夫妻的家庭收支，認爲不免會「吃盡當光」，不免會「濫開空頭支票」而實行通貨膨脹。帶了這副悲觀眼鏡來看法幣，來看外滙，於是越看越悲觀。</p>
<p>誰都知道：跟着開發內地，跟着補充那些破爛的與火燬的法幣，法幣的增發，勢所必要。又誰都知道：今日各地的利率都比平時高漲；在上海，除了拆息高漲之外，還有滙劃貼現的高漲；這恰巧都是銀根緊而不是通貨膨脹的現象。但一談到法幣發行量巳超過三十億元時，則父都覺得失之過多。然試以四億五千萬人均攤，則每人還分不到六元七角。比之外國，簡直是小巫與大巫。</p>
<p>各國紙幣發行量及其人口</p>
<p>紙幣發行量　本國人口數　每人平均可得</p>
<p>日本　三、八一八　六九　五五·二</p>
<p>美國　四、九五六　一二三　四〇·四</p>
<p>英國　五五五　四五　一二·三</p>
<p>法國　一五一、三二二　四二　三、六〇三</p>
<p>德國　一一、七九八　八〇　一四七·五</p>
<p>中國　三、〇八二　四五〇　六·七</p>
<p>（註）紙幣發行量單位各國本位幣一百萬；人口單位爲百萬人；每人平均可得各國本位幣一校。</p>
<p>至於地方券的發行，爲數旣不多，且都以法幣做發行準備。所以法幣的發行量內，顯然還有一部份是不流通的。不僅此也；　種不流通的法幣，不止於地方券的發行準備，還有各地金融機關的支付準備，爲數必定更大。據一般估計：三十偉元的法幣，集中在上海的的十億元，留在華北一帶的約四億元，流到香港，安南等國外的文有四億元。因此在全國廣大而積裹，事實上只有十二億元的法幣在流通着。所以即以地方券加算，不能不說他依然是「粥少僧多」。</p>
<p>不錯：大家所怕的「通貨膨脹」，或許本來不是嫌法幣發行景的增加，却在擔心法幣的發行準備金不够。拿準備金來估計貨幣價値，在現代的貨幣思潮裏，只好說他是「帶了老光眼鏡背老法書」。</p>
<p>嚴格點說：法幣是一種管理通貨，在他的法律根據繼續存在的一天，就是完全沒有準備金，他的價値還是不會减少分毫。這並不是法律的武斷，因爲法律有國家做後臺。而國家呢，則有廣大的人力，物力，財力，以及熱烈要求自由生存的民族精神力做後臺。人力，物力，財力，構成法幣眞價値的物質基礎；偉大的民族精神力，保障着這些人力，物力，財力確屬法幣所有。大家都堅信在最後勝利到來的那天，黑滙市價定必立刻大鬆特鬆。在這大鬆特鬆時，準備金當然不會立刻大增特增。那末法幣眞價値不在金準備的多少；而今日的黑滙價之不能代表法幣的眞價値，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>理論上，法幣有無金準備固不成問題；事實上，法幣的金備，至今確　還維持着四八·九％至五八·〇％之多。比英國去年八月的金準備率三八·二％，德國今年一月的〇·七％都大得多。與法國去年十一月的五九·四％堪稱伯仲。</p>
<p>假使你們懷疑政府數字或許太高，那末就拿有意低估的日本數字來說明。日人中傷法幣是無所不用其極；但他們還是不得不承認法幣確實擁有鉅額的金準備。試觀他們由「破壞法幣」進爲今日的「利用法幣」，足見他們已不能不承認法幣的實力雄厚與蒂固根深的事實。再看他們的出版界，「研究」中國法幣的文章時有所見，但都不敢武斷法幣的準備已空虛。像本年四月份出版的東洋雜誌裏載着一篇井村薰雄的文章；這位作者是中傷法幣的能手。他一開始就揑言「法幣的發行權已被英美二國共管」。以他這副態度，便可想見他對於法幣準備金，一定是非常武斷地低估着的。然而他武斷的低估結果是什麽呢？</p>
<p>（一）去年底香港滙豐銀行內作爲法幣準備金的中國政府存款　的三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇港元</p>
<p>（二）同期同行內以中國政府要人私產居最多數的私人存款的五五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇等元</p>
<p>（三）同期中國國內存銀總額（按一元等於〇·七七盎斯計算）的七六三·九五〇·〇〇〇盎斯</p>
<p>（四）同期存在美國聯邦準備銀行作爲法幣外滙牛準基金的白銀　（的一七一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯</p>
<p>可充法幣基金的，顯不止此四種。法幣的發行準備，事實上又不在此四種之內而另有他的獨立會計。井村之如此淆混事實，在他中傷法幣的動機上原屬必要。即以此四種合計也達十七億元，的當同時的法幣發行量六成左右，較官報數尙高。假定其中半數是政府不能支配的私產，那末能支配的仍當發行量三成左右。雖則井村把上列第二第三兩種擯列爲私產，而認法幣的發行準備已只有五億二千二百萬元。但比之日本尙勝多多。因爲前年底，日本的匯兌基金，據他官報的已减剩三億日元。再加算他每年新採金的官報數二億日元，在華掠奪所得的年約二億日元，那末他去年可充匯兌基金的共七億日元；可是他去年對第三國的貿易入超達四億六百萬日元。可兒他去年底剩餘的匯兌基金至多只有二億九千四百萬日元。僅抵他當時紙幣發行量三十八億二千萬日元的一成還不到。何况他的這些官數更有疑問。</p>
<p>馬克盧布的破產眞相</p>
<p>在五二那天在風暴雨裏，因爲財部態度沉默，市塲謠言錯亂，暴縮程度猛烈，購貨在熱普遍等等，認識不淸的人們，心理上幾乎跌進上屆歐戰初終時馬克和盧布的破產時代一樣地慌張。就在平時，一般人亦因黑匯的日縮，法幣發行數字的年增，戰事行進的方興求艾，常引起種種漠然的不安而發出一法幣會不會變成馬克或盧布」的可笑疑問。</p>
<p>這種慌張，這種疑問，實在因爲不瞭解歷史事實，而只記着歷史現象所致。殊不知歐戰初終的馬克破產，盧布破產，都出於德國政府與蘇俄政府有意造成。否則也決不會弄到如此一塌糊塗。</p>
<p>德國政府武力上旣無法抵抗協約國，而協的國索取三百萬萬余馬克的賠款，父斷非德國朝野所能承受。因爲接受這種要求，德國經濟也是破產；所以他們便用破釜沉舟的手段來摧毀馬克，摧毀協約國對德索取鉅額賠款的奢望。於是馬克的發行便無理由地膨脹，不斷地無限地膨脹，終於使馬克的價値，跌到了千百萬倍零度以下的零度。</p>
<p>至於蘇俄政府之促使盧布的破產。更出於他們主義上的策略，紅軍雖已解除資產階級的武裝，可是盧布的價値，還是保障着資產階級在社會上的　勢力。尤公和沒收的力量不能達於窖藏部份，要使窖藏部份也澈底消滅，蘇俄政府便決定採用犧牲盧布的手段。從一九一八年起，盧布的發行量，便在蘇俄政府有計畫的膨脹之下完成了他的破壞手段。有如此表。</p>

<p>這種有計劃的破壞，盧布的　値自然不可遏制地慘跌。十月革命時，一個盧布，名義上可値美金五角二分；一九二三年時，每元美金名義上已値五百萬盧布。蘇俄政府在一九二四年二月八日發行金盧布票，此種金盧布票，同樣沒有任何準備　只有一個法價，依該這種法價，每五萬個一九二三年發行的盧布，可以換這樣的一個金盧布；而一九二三年發行的盧布，又等於一九二三年以前發行的舊盧布一百萬個。由此可知一九二四年蘇俄政府收回舊盧布時，舊盧布的價値已　跌落了五百萬萬倍之下（根據Lawton，An　Economic　History　of　Soviet　Russia）。然而這種不値錢的現象，並不眞的反射　他的對外匯價上。對美滙兌行市，且比平價反貴。直到一九二四年三月十日起開始按上定官價收回舊盧布後，才降落一些，但還在平價之上，且從此就站住不動。對英匯價，雖一度縮在平價之下，但旋即回昇。有如次表</p>

<p>又　七月一日　九·四三五　一·九四五</p>
<p>（註）據Narodny　bank　MonthlyReview　Nay.1931.單位爲盧布。</p>
<p>盧布的國內價値慘跌述國際價値小變；而且一經整理，他的國內價値也就立刻回昇，並迅速恢復常態。如以一九一三年的物價作一百分，那末他一九二四年十月一日的批發物價，不過一六四·三分；零售物價也不過二〇三分。換句話說；前者僅較戰前貴六四·三％，後者僅較戰前貴一〇三％。這在僅知歷史現象而不懂歷史事實的人們，恐怕是意想不到的罷！</p>
<p>這當然不是奇蹟，也不是自然現象，乃係蘇俄政府的人爲結果。換句話說：這也是蘇俄人民精神力的發揚。一切古典的貨幣理論，一切拜金主義的貨幣理論，他們根本不會瞭解今日國際匯兌價格的決定關係的。所以盧布的名義價値雖隨發行惡膨脹而慘烈跌落，可是他們實際上的國際收支，却依然堅持着法定的平價。因此戰後的國際匯兌學裏便有「購買力平價說」，的產生，認爲決定國際匯價的主要因素，在於國際貿易的平衡，不在於貨幣素材與幣値的是否平衡？那末我國的戰時貿易正在好轉的現在，黑匯市價的如此跌落，更沒有理由。</p>
<p>「自然水準」與「人為水準」</p>
<p>現在或許正有不少人在研究着：「目前對英三便士半，對美四元六八七五，是否就是新的自然水準」？甚至還會硏究着：「這個水準，將穩定多少時間」？</p>
<p>一般投機份子，依照他們的投機經騐，想像着所謂「自然水準」也者，一定一個較前爲低的匯價。因此黑滙市塲每經一個風潮，便產生一個新的所謂「自然水準」；而且每個新的「自然水準」總是使黑滙價縮去一二成。我覺得這是對於「自然水準」的一種侮辱。財部發言人希望黑匯市塲在自由上落中產生一個「自然水準」，如果他也把較低匯價當做「自然水準」，實在也是一個莫可比擬的錯誤！</p>
<p>依照上述對於國際匯價的決定關鍵來說國際匯價的主要因素，不在貨幣素材與幣値吾牛衡？而在商品貿易的是否平衡。而欲硏討商品貿易平衡的趨勢，理應依照法定的一先令二便士半的匯率來覜測戰時貿易的趨勢。如根據黑匯價推算，那來所得的結果，只是貨幣現象，只是物價現象，而不是商品貿易的眞相。唯有從商品貿易的眞相，才能發現決定匯價的主要因素正在如何變化，於是可以判斷目前的黑匯行市的是否合理？是否合乎所謂「自然水凖」的意義了？</p>
<p>這種理論如果不錯，那末我國戰時貿易平衡的趨勢，非　不比戰前惡化，抑且比戰前有很大的進步。這種進步斷非瞎吹，因爲戰時的新建設，足够抵消砲火下破壞的一部份，高物價又自然節的了一部份消費。如果內地的情形不足以代表全國的情形，那末不妨退一步拿凖淪陷區裏的上海對外貿易來說吧。上海的貿易向居全國貿易總額的半數之上。那末上海貿易平衡的實績，理應有力地彩響着國際匯價的趨勢了。（本笷亦未完）</p>

<h3>大漲小跌之煤市</h3>
<p>本市熱斜，自戰事發生後，共產煤礦，因地處淪陷，交通阻梗，不得不抑給與舶來洋煤，以資供應，故行情上落，皆以匯市緊縮爲依歸，朝令暮改，漲落靡定，當本月二日先令暴縮，煤業市塲，當日竟停市一天，隔宿定貨，無形取銷，（以是該日因悔的而閙糾紛者，不一而足）翌日，烟白煤各貨，同集行拆，每噸均漲起五六十元，（照盤的加三四成不等），揆之情理，本市日常存底，不下十餘萬噸，俱係廉價成本，價格不應得風即升，但貨主一味以成本攸關，後貨斷檔爲詞，我行我素，實行其趁火打刦之手段，乘機抬價耳。</p>
<p>直至最近，金融漸見安定，外滙步步回鬆，美匯由四元一二五長全五元五三一二五，各種洋貨，無形中减輕三成貨本，將恢復前月原來　態，應漲旣漲，應减宜减，且目前匯水計算，最低限度，亦須减去前漲三分之二，方爲正理，但貨主不此之圖，一聞先令緊縮，朝令幕改，怎恐漲價之不速，近日外匯步步回鬆，成本减輕，則又充耳不聞，意存觀望，擯持原盤，不肯削碼，是以「成本所限耶」？抑「來源有斷檔之虞」？按之本週，洋煤之來自印度喀爾喀塔，印度支那。及法屬安南。鴻基。烟白煤各貨，不下三萬餘噸，照常供應，航運無阻，×煤尙不與矣，所謂「來源斷檔」云云，其中雖有一二煤商，稍明事理，自動减盤，但亦大漲小跌，尙不澈底，（即以鴻基白煤論之，前週由一百七十元漲至二白三十元，每噸加起六十元，叫成左右，近日雖創去十四元盤子，尙不及四分之一，其他如印度烟煤，尙擬擯持三百元高盤，但市氣虛弱，人心望下，暗盤撳低二十元盤子，尙無受主，煤市形勢，已可見一斑），蓋强弩之末，難以爲繼，故甚望煤業界能及早爲謀，自動减低，勿因循就誤，致「賠了夫人父折兵」也，</p>
<p>至於煤球業，因係平民普遍然料，更爲引人注意，一旬之中，已連跌四盤，减低二十四元盤子，門莊零售，每擔亦已减低一元二角，有增有减，誠亦經商者之正當手續也，（培）</p>
<h3>洋煤市氣虛弱　——人心望下——</h3>
<p>洋煤各貨、邇來先令雖日見回鬆、但一二行家、執持成見、希圖漁利、對於行折、仍擯持原盤、不肯削碼、印度烟煤、仍做三百元頂盤、但市氣虛弱、人心望下、暗盤撳低二十餘元、急求出籠、尙無受主、其他如婆羅洲煤因落至兩百七十元、亦無大成交、實緣街客意存觀望、量入爲出、不願多進、而行家有意把持、更力促成出胃呆滯、</p>
<h3>車赤下跌最鉅</h3>

<p>點錫　昨日市面僅船廠家機器廠等搜去十餘担、紹興幫客商亦購去三四十担光景、實交無若何熱烈、故其市象依然蕭條、惟市塲人心、因來源缺乏、申市存底不豐、開價並未見鬆、如小　錫喊一千二百元、荷蘭錫沾一千三百元云、</p>
<h3>錫邑米麪看小</h3>

<h3>陳栩園先生給我的印象</h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>——爲今日寗波同鄕會追悼會作——</p>
<p>栩園先生作古了。我這裏並不想把他生平的言行和事業，作什麼系統的傳述，或加以鋪張的渲染，祇就他二十多年來所給予我的印象，的略摭拾一二，籍以表示我對於他的景仰：</p>
<p>（一）奮鬥精神　栩園先生早年時，曾以公子哥兒的姿態從事商業，如印刷所書坊等，結果是全部失敗。可是他並不灰心，雖則他的「天虛我生」的別署，似乎有些兒因不爲世用而禁不住「憤慨」的含意，但他祇用它來激勵自己，並不就此消極。後來他利用了「筆耕」的途徑，作爲過渡，終於迂迴地達到了他的「有志實業」的宏願，憑著赤手空拳建立了爲祖國挽回利權的一個小小的堡壘——家庭工業社。</p>
<p>（二）好學不倦　他是個對於國學有深切硏究的人，對於西方科學可稱完全是門外漢。可是他孜孜不良，不怕「八十歲學打拳」，凡有關於實業製造——不限於化裝品——的科學和原理，他都肯研求探討，直至能了解應用才止。我有一次在他的辦公桌上，看見展開了一本易經，百忙中他正在勤懇地批註呢。</p>
<p>（三）有問必答他的好學求知，似乎並不是專爲著滿足他個人的求知慾，更不是借學問做敲門磚，用以達到他個人「發財」的目的。他有著一種孔老夫子所說的「已達達人」的態度。他的求學是「爲人」，「爲社會」，「爲國家」。所以不論面熟陌生，祇要誠意去請敎他，他總是「知無不言，言無不盡」的。我想他的「誨人不倦」「循循善誘」的文章，發表在申報「衣食住行周刋」以及其他雜誌上的，早已有目共賞，我俗這裏也不想多說了。</p>
<p>我相信上面道三點，對於一般靑年都有値得一顧」的價値。因爲道三點都是做一個「人」的基本條件。吾則無論一個人生前在社會上的地位多麽高，聲譽多麼大，如果他祇爲著個人，或是一家，那祇是一個「行尸走肉」，我是不願虛費無謂的筆墨的。</p>
<h3>談襪</h3>
<p>— 沈浮</p>
<p>每次看到「衣食住行」的時候，總可以看見到一個「談」字。不是談鞋」，就是「談布」，甚至談到「鈕扣」。因此我也不妨來談談「襪子」吧！</p>
<p>襪子是日常不可缺少的服裝附屬品。現在的人們大都喜歡穿絲襪。試想，着絲襪有什麽益處呢？旣不經濟，又不耐穿，徒然多耗金錢，爭得一點美觀而已。近來物價飛漲，絲襪非一二元能購，我想還是着線襪好，非但耐用，而且樸素，不是也實行了新生活嗎？但是線機也要七八角一雙，怎能不愛惜穿着呢！因此我們要好好地去整理它。最好每天調換洗晒，隔日洗換也可，因爲常洗常換可以保持脚部淸潔，不致有濕氣病的發生。又可免險襪子被脚汗所腐壞。有了小洞就應該當晚將它補好，不然就要「小洞不補，大洞吃苦」，以至不能再穿，豈不可惜。現當春夏之交，天氣漸熱，已有許多人（尤其女人）光着腿不穿襪子了。這個方法倒是不但合了時代的潮流，也可以節省襪</p>
<p>子的費用，眞是一舉兩得。</p>

<h3>元寶籃</h3>
<p>— 王永濤</p>
<p>「元寶籃」這名詞，諸位知道的一定很少，現在讓我來說明吧！它是寗波的古老交通器具；用篾竹編成，形式和搖籃一樣。兩傍有竹槓兩根，那是給槓夫抬的。</p>
<p>籃上沒有頂，乘客要遮蔽陽光，就要自己撐着陽傘。籃裏是有棉坐墊的，故乘客坐在裏面，很是舒適。</p>
<p>寗波每一名勝之地，是都有它的設備。戰前的玉皇，天童，和奉化的雪實寺，汽車站上，鱗次櫛比。只要汽車到，他們便上來攬生意了。現在雖不如戰前熱鬧，但生意還算不錯呢！</p>
<p>元寳籃還有別的用處，因爲在偏僻鄕村。一旦有八患了病，那末，要去治病，旣沒有汽車可僱，又沒有人力車可乘，雖然趁轎也可以，但總不合病人乘坐，故唯一代替品，就要算元寳籃了。因爲人乘在裏面，還可把身子躺下來呢！</p>
<h3>避免火災</h3>
<p>— 芍農</p>
<p>據救火會報吿，在去年上海曾發生了一千一百次的火災，由此可見火災在目前的上海是一個何等嚴重的問題了。本文爲美國希爾Howatd　Cope－land　Hfll在「社會生活與民衆問題一中之原著，希爾爲美國芝加哥大學之社會學系主任，其所述防火之法，雖對美國而言，然何論何國，其防火之道，也不外乎此，現特譯之如下：</p>
<p>當美國政府，在一九一八年決定築建十六個本城，以備新國防軍駐紮的時候，火險公司立刻覺得這個計劃很始危險，爲了希望戰勝敵人，他們自願至營中服務，以冀滅少失火的機會。於是在每幢建築物之間均隔有幾百碼的空地，同時建有大的水源供給器，每一幢建築物均備有救火水桶及共他滅火器具，救火員十分精細地訓練着，電綫及水汀等均照着科學方法建造，結果在每一營內，均沒有遭受火災的損失。</p>
<p>倘使普通人民，也這樣的注意着，那末火災的損失，將大大地减少了。法律的懲罰疏忽者，確有奇效，在歐洲各國，倘使他的財產，因疏忽而遭焚毀，那末他就被視爲犯罪者，倘使因他的疏忽，而致損害了他的鄰居，那末他必須儘他的力量付出這損失，並且有時候，他必須被禁起來，因此，因疏忽　遭失愼之事確也减少了不少，當然法律之於社會是十分有效的。</p>
<p>愼用火柴，焰火，洋油，及揮發油，移去碎物及各種引火之物，也能助之使减少一大半的損失　倘使失了火，最緊要的不但是不要驚慌失措，而是要準守着幾種細小之點；如緊閉窗戶，以使火熖不能通入，緊貼着地板以避烟幕，當經過一間充滿着烟的房間時須以潮濕的布遮在頭上。</p>
<p>全國救火總會亦印有防禦火災的條例：一·在暴露的火上（如牆壁火爐之類）須有遮蓋之物。二·不要把乾燥的衣服太放近火爐，三·捆起舊報紙並隨時出賣，四·決不要把有火的灰燼放入木製的器具內。五·把油類物質放入金屬的罐中。六·不要把零碎的雜物　積起來。</p>
<h3>利用夏季時間運動</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>最近旅滬的外僑，在推進一種節省夏季白晝時間運動。所謂「利用」「節省」夏季的白晝時間，就是爲了夏天日子長，黎明天亮得很早，午後爲了冗長而使人感到疲倦，所以主張辦公時間上午增加一小時，而下午减少一小時。</p>
<p>這個原則，已得到公共租界工部局的贊同，全個上海有許多公司洋行，將自六月一日起到九月底實行。這樣上半天可以早起，而下半天可以有充分的休息時間，恢復工作的疲勞，能使健康增進。這個計劃，在美國早已嘗試過，而且幾年來巳獲得相當的效果。</p>
<p>也許規模較小的零賣商店，以爲這個計劃實行之後，他們在營業方面將受到打擊。但就英國嘗試的結果，道完全不確的；相反的，爲了利用夏季時間運動的推進，有若干零售商店，生意反而更好。因爲使辦公房職員可獲得更多的時間去瀏覽櫥窗，不是急於回家吃晚飯了。不過另一面，我們要知道午後减少一小時的辦公時刻，目的在使你尋找適當的休息，如上公園；跑圖齊館之類，要是到舞榭歌台的塲合去，那有違提倡利用夏天白晝時問的初旨了呢</p>
<h3>「行」之安全（續）</h3>
<p>又據搭乘此船抵荷蘭之另一海員稱，　貝號船被炸之頃，本人適因盥沐，弛上衣，閱警匆忙逃命，遂不及取隨身携帶之錢，同時如手錶自來水筆之小件貴重品，霎時間被人掠奪一空。並開船上之保險箱，亦已有人　破，輕而易取之細軟，在千鈞一髮之頃，儘有人乘機掠取，且在此輩肆掠者，固萬不料此船雖轟破而卒未沈也。</p>
<p>查此船洋面被炸，而獨免於多數人命之犧牲，反比中國國內旅行加上幾倍之安全者，除船員有鎭定之修養外，尙賴有下述數種設備。（一）裝發動機motor便於抵抗風浪之救生艇。隻數多而一整備就緖，其內並藏足應急需之乾糧等物。（二）每船備有足供十六人挾持免遭滅頂之救生浮盤heavy　life－saving　floats各兩具。盤邊鼓起，形似橡膠輪，乃以帆布爲皮，其內實以爪哇Java時產絲光棉樹Silk－cotton　tree果壳中取得之壳帛Kapok。壳帛色糙曰，西人用以塞枕，質甚輕而不易受潮，利於浮水。（三）不欹傾之平浮器floating　apparatus。每船一器，乃於木板上下兩面四周圍，釘住中空而便浮揚之無數石油桶，並以堅强之繩索，連綴油桶外旁之板沿，俾落水者，得因拖住繩索，攀登油桶環繞中之板面。（四）比照全船人數又加半數之救生馬甲。（一作救生衣。）（五）無綫電報警設備。（六）防空面罩。語曰，養兵千日，用之一時，行船不可無防危險之工具，正猶立國於世界之不可無國防，亦猶愼策城市安全之不可無警察。處萬方多難之秋，自有異乎承平之日，華海員身越萬里重洋，深入水雷界域，勇往靜定，蔚爲「海上服務之光榮」，其安全之程度，何以反有勝於國內「千金之子」，此中利害得失，非盡繫乎船務當局識歷之淺深歟。吾華一切新事物，莫不學步於西方，萬不容掛一漏萬，以誤人者轉以自誤，目自古迄今，凡求有較大之便利者，每須計及利中之弊，而兼籌防弊之方，故如上述各式進爲羣衆保安全之「利器」，在我中國，必將緊隨一切新設施而俱興，必將成爲未來世界有佳望之一種實業。世有明達，蓋不亟起圖之。（完）</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>鰣魚上市已有一個月，這幾天的價格已漸漸地低降了：每兩大的在八分左右，和猪肉不相上下。鰣魚雖說是貴族化，但是現在却與猪肉同價，猶肉旣在我的經濟菜單中有它的地位，那麽鰣魚當然也可參加一下了。我對於鰣魚並不怎樣愛好，而我家做主人的，却非常愛吃，有了鰣魚，飯可以多吃半碗，因此我每天總得出四角錢，買五兩來分作兩塊，分裝兩碗淸燉，加一些猪油丁在內，好在兒女們筷下留情，大家總算都嘗過新了。鰣魚的美點，全在鱗上，所以別的魚要去鱗，獨有鰣魚不能去鱗的。煮法有淸燉和紅燒二種，但你要吃得鮮嫩，還是淸燉的好。</p>

<h3>你往哪裏去　（二）</h3>
<p>你往那裏去」？這自問話的要點，不是指着你一生工作做完了，太陽快下山了，你往什麽地方去。這個將來命運的問題，誠然重要，但若我們目前勉勵做人，這將來的問題，自然會得着相當解決的。所以這句問話，實質上是說，你現在往那裏去？你有什麽習慣？對于上帝和人，持什麽理想和態度？對于自己持什麽理想和態度？若是從現在起，你照現行方向，再過十年或三十年，將到達什麽地方？大凡從大學畢業出來，改變一般行徑的人不多。某君脫得好，「我們現在是什麽，將來也是什麽。」我們的習慣態度都養成了。現在請問你們引到生命之路在那裏？你是照理想，還是照衝動而行呢？是遵貪婪之路，還是循慷慨之道而行呢？是利用他人，還是與他們同患難，共安樂呢？是隨風　蕩，還是向上攀登呢？是基督徒，還是非基督徒？我們現在的生活怎樣，我們將來的成就也必怎樣。經上說，「人種的是什麽，收的也必是什麽。」所以，緊要關鍵，不在你從那裏出身，乃是你現在往那裏去。許多研究心理學而在哲學上沒有基礎的人，說生命是一部機器。我們却認爲不然。我們主張人對自己的行爲負責任，凡故意犯法殺人者，常按律治罪。自然，我們不可輕視環境的影響，但當定局之時，那改變人生之路的主權，却操在我們自己。我們對于各種不同的生活方法和行爲方法，儘，可加以抉擇。美國傳約翰在百年前曾說過句名言，他說，一凡聽任世俗劫持者，即等于聽任世俗指揮。」許多人的行爲是如此。反過來說，那不肯聽任世俗所爲的，世俗也便不能轄制他們。哈佛大學校長嘗說，「今日敎育靑年做良好公民，其最重要之點，就是敎訓他們怎樣抵抗無意義的宣傳。」設使靑年自知要往那裏去，並旦立志要達到那高尙目標，那末，他就得拿起杖來反對羣衆的推動，或狡許的宣傳，養成力量去赴自己的路。（待續）</p>

<h3>今後的救難工作</h3>
<p>— 前車</p>
<p>上海各收容所的難民，將一　限於本月底前遺散，這些田園荒蕪，家破人散的同胞父老姊妹子弟們，遣散後的前途如何，實使人小敢臆測。難民協會諸公，竭其心力，爲他們奔走呼號這許久時候，終於因經費支絀，出此下策，其衷心的隱痛，當更在吾人之上。</p>
<p>這悲慘事實的造成，當然是捐款的日漸减少，所謂惻隱之心，人皆有之，現在是早已備砲聲俱逝，並變本加厲，握經濟的權威，投機操縱，此倡彼和，造成「孤島」空前悲劇，一般市民的生活都在朝不保夕，難民的生命還有誰來顧及呢！幸而救難諸公，軟硬並施，旣利用遊藝會以廣募，更加收難民捐以副之，救難經費能够維持到今天，已經是大不容易了。</p>
<p>不過事實上救難亦自有其缺點在，譬如喊了一陣的「擴大難民生產運動」，雖有過幾决出品展覽，然結果不得不認爲失敗。更小幸的有許多難胞，因安坐而食，養成他們的惰性，未免予人以藉口，使救難工作發生障碍。</p>
<p>往者已矣，來者可追，對於現在還保留着的殘廢老弱寡婦孤兒，不能再像從前一樣，這是希望救難諸公，宜及早統盤計算，雖然這工作的更艱苦是上定的。同時，更有一點不能已於言者，就是「救會」本身的開支，務求竭力撙節，不得浪費分文，因爲今後的救難經費，經常的恐怕只有難民捐上項收入了。</p>
<h3>籲請缺課學校力謀補救</h3>
<p>— 立言</p>
<p>光陰如流水般的快，一轉眼學年終了的暑假快到了。自秋季暑假，在一年五十二星期當中，除去各種法定的假期及人事的休課以外（如學校本身的紀念，以及展覽會，競賽會，參觀等）實際上讀書的日子很少，尤其是在孤島上的學生，因環境特殊，敎室經濟，再遇到隨便請假的敎員，功課再打個折扣，眞是少之又少了。</p>
<p>學校對於各種學科敎畢進度，論理是依照敎育部的規定程序，某某科每年應敎到甚麽程度，是有一定標準的。然而有些學校因本身的組織小健全，請敎員不審愼，人事上時有變動，敎員常常的換，功課常常的缺，再加以放寒暑假比別人家早開學比別人家遲，在寒假的時候。學生書本未能照預定進度敎完的，尙可諉之於下學期開快車，把他趕完。現在暑假快要到了，若不從速亡羊補牢，一直讓他缺下去，學生舉的小足數，那末，不論是升級，轉學或投考，程度皆嫌不够，學生未免太吃虧，學校當局，似乎要負些責任吧。</p>
<p>所以我覺得乘離開暑假還有一個多月的持候，爲全上海市各級學校學生的學業着想，請求上海學校的賢明當局，對於敎授各科敎本，精細的估量統計一下，是否有些主要課程，因以往人事上種種問題，致缺課過多，未合法定進程；倘使有的話，現在就要趕緊統盤籌劃，力圖補救辦法，利用各種假期，及有餘時間，乃至稍加延長課期，節短暑假，務使學生補足一學年應學之課，俾無缺陷，這不但對得起學生，對得起學生的家屬，也是個人職務上應盡的責任，希望賢明的學校當局能接受並實行區區之愚忱。</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿四回　湖山蕩滌各有千秋　士女歡騰共同呼萬歲</p>
<p>他們一羣人，到了自由村小學校裏坐了一坐，朱愛人就說：老祖父留吃夜飯的意思、朱愛　又說：『不過我們這裏，正是鄉村市遠，一點沒有佳味可餐，實在是簡慢得很的。可是鄉村也有鄉村的風味，偶然吃一餐，換換口味，未嘗不可，要請諸位賞光了。」蘇理雅太太聽了，先自鼓掌贊成，她是一位最坦直的美國太太。人家本想再客氣幾句，她旣贊成了，也沒有什麽說的了。朱愛人便說：我們此刻一同去看廠址吧。大家仍舊坐了家庭旅行車，那時車　裏父多了老朱先生一人。去小學校也不遠，臨運河的一塊地，也不過七八畝光　。若要開拓，展向裹面，也還有二三十畝。運河的對面，便是水竹村了，倘然要到對面水竹村去，離開此地約一里之遙，有一座謝烈士　，爲紀念　時抗戰陣亡謝烈士而建築的，兜過此橋，方到鄰村。林建成看了這關地址，覺得很滿意，他說：『雖然中國現在陸路運輸很發達，但是有水路運輸，更爲便利。此間沿河有七八畝地，大概也够了，倘然不够的話，也可以隨時展拓，還有二三十里，你們也訂了一個租地優先權就是了。廠屋預　造一個三層樓，其他如棧房，工人宿舍，事務所，碼　等等，都包括在內。此外何家兩位小姐的父親何先生，不是還要造一所別墅嗎？這別墅小必一定要沿河的，因爲他就是嫌上海太鬧，所以要作村居，取其靜一點而已。而且占地也不必太人，並不要造什麽花園，角一兩畝地，也就够了。林建成就其地址，便用他的手記簿，先畫了一個草圖，得其大略，然後再詳細的規畫。原來朱村長到底是位老先生了，他把這個自由村，還要保存着農村的風範。但從林建成的眼光看來，就自由村的環境以及它的趨勢看來，自由村必將成爲一個工業新村，已經顯然可見了。因爲中國目從戰後復興以來，以一個農業國，漸漸變成了農工並重的國家，如美國，蘇俄一般。有許多內地，正在改良農業，提倡畜牧，而較爲開通之地，如江浙兩省地方，工業勃然而興。它們在大都會的地方，小能容納許多工廠，自然而然的疏散到　近各鄕鎭來了。（　八二）</p>

<h3>Hua Army in Southern Henan Recovers Xinyang; Intense Street Fighting in the City, Twelve Japanese Planes Destroyed; Chinese Troops Occupy All Heights Near Lishan</h3>

<h3>Soviet Labor Newspaper Comments on the Sino-Japanese War: Japanese Forces Greatly Weakened, Chinese Troops Gain Initiative</h3>
<p>Moscow: Today, the Labor Newspaper commented on the Sino-Japanese War, stating: "The losses suffered by Japan in this war may not be recoverable within ten or fifteen years. The Sino-Japanese War has now entered its third year. We dare to say that Japan's military strength has been weakened, and the Chinese army has gained the initiative. The Japanese originally intended to destroy the Chinese army, but this plan has completely failed. China has entered the great second stage of the War of Resistance, and the situation is extremely good. The further consolidation of the anti-Japanese united front, the loyalty of the government under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, and the destruction of all pro-Japanese traitors are the main factors for the final victory of the great Chinese people."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States, the Soviet Union, and the Far East Today</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news dispatches, the British side is currently considering sending a special envoy to the Soviet Union to promote Anglo-Soviet relations. Although this is unconfirmed news, it cannot help but remind us of the same time a year ago, when people all over the world were deeply concerned about the protracted and unresolved Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Unfortunately, the subsequent development of events was contrary to people's expectations. The three-nation negotiations were delayed and then shelved, replaced by the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, and the scourge of war in Europe became unavoidable. This page of painful lessons shows that any attempt to curb aggression must be forward-looking and decisive, and must never be ambiguous, or obscured by prejudice, lest one eventually regrets too late.</p>
<p>Now the European continent is in the midst of war, with its scope extending to one-third of the countries in Europe, and its momentum is even more dangerous than the previous World War. Although Nazi Germany clearly has the upper hand at present, the final victory or defeat cannot be determined by temporary advances and retreats. Even if the British side is truly engaged in brewing a reconciliation with the Soviet Union by abandoning suspicion, its significance is far from comparable to the three-nation negotiations last year. Apart from watching its development, there is no need to criticize it further. Outside of Europe, the Far East is still in the autumn of unrest. If, in Europe, all plans for locking the stable door after the horse has bolted are insignificant, then it is necessary to consider future changes in the Pacific situation with a view to taking precautions.</p>
<p>The tense situation in the Dutch East Indies, which has been realized due to the invasion of the Netherlands, seems to have eased again. Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Japan have all issued statements maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. On the other hand, the situation in Shanghai, which is of greatest concern to Chinese and foreigners, has recently been prevented from being coveted by ambitious people due to the wise measures of US Fleet Commander Hart. Looking at all these developments, it seems that the Western Pacific may be able to maintain a temporary peace, and may not cause major disturbances for the time being. This fact need not be needlessly speculated. However, statesmen who control the world's destiny must not be satisfied with merely maintaining the status quo, but must be able to see the subtle signs and take proactive measures to prevent problems before they arise. Judging from the actions of the United States and the Soviet Union over the past year, such as the US abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the large-scale naval exercises in the Pacific, and the repeated statements regarding the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as the Soviet Union's generous support for China's war of resistance and its firm attitude in dealing with Japan, both the US and the Soviet Union can be said to have fulfilled considerable responsibilities. Today, although the European powers have been drawn into the vortex of war, the arrogant Japanese warlords still dare not act arbitrarily and do as they please. On the one hand, this is due to China's success in the war of resistance; on the other hand, it is not a small part due to the restraints of the US and the Soviet Union. However, to curb aggression and stabilize the Far East, these existing efforts are clearly not enough.</p>
<p>Although the United States and the Soviet Union have the same position and interests in the Far East, their actions are independent of each other and do not match each other. Not only is there a lack of understanding and cooperation, but there is also a subtle posture of mutual suspicion between the two sides. Even though the Soviet-Finnish war has been over for a long time, this suspicion has not been eliminated to this day. This is a major weakness in the Far Eastern international situation, and it is also the most worrying thing in future developments. The Japanese warlords have repeatedly used this gap, repeatedly applying their artificial "pro-" and "anti-" postures between the Soviet Union and the United States. Although the result has been nothing so far, they may not fail to take advantage of opportune moments to repeat this trick, causing harm to all countries. Moreover, the current policies of the US and the Soviet Union toward the Far East are sufficient to protect the status quo, but insufficient to prevent disasters. At a time when Britain and France are struggling to cope with Germany's fierce offensive, and the situation in the Mediterranean is extremely dangerous, the United States' participation in the European war will likely be unavoidable sooner or later, so it is necessary to make further preparations for the Far East as soon as possible. If the European war once affects the US, the balance of power in the Western Pacific will be in danger of being broken again. That prospect is exactly what the Japanese warlords are waiting for. At that time, they will inevitably threaten Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union with an aggressive posture. Problems such as the Dutch East Indies will inevitably become serious again. This possibility is increasing with the crisis of the European war. It may be the last opportunity now. If the powers do not quickly seek preventive measures, they will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the worsening European situation.</p>
<p>In order to curb the spread of wildfires and prevent future turmoil, coordination and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is the most effective and essential way. Of course, until recently, there have been no signs of rapprochement between these two countries, and even the psychological barriers have not diminished. This unfortunate situation cannot be allowed to drag on. Originally, the differences in political systems and differences in thought are not reasons to prevent policy cooperation between the two countries. Compared with the tragedies suffered by mankind due to aggression, these problems are too small! For the sake of certain interests, Nazi Germany can change and join hands with communist Soviet Union. This kind of spirit is worth emulating by democratic countries. Look at the accusations in the British Parliament the other day regarding the failure of the three-nation negotiations last year, and you can understand how essential it is to organize a common anti-aggression action in the Far East today. Whether for the sake of the US and Soviet Union's own interests, or for the future of the Western Pacific, cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union is needed. If the US and the Soviet Union can cooperate, even if the European war expands again, this united force in the Far East will still be enough to control the situation with ease. Otherwise, apart from China herself, it will not be difficult to eventually gain independence and freedom with its ever-increasing strength, but the entire Pacific situation will inevitably remain difficult to be optimistic about. This point should be deeply considered by enlightened people all over the world.</p>
<h3>German Troops Cross the Sambre River. Allied Forces Continue Retreating from the Border. Fierce Battles Raged in Northern France Yesterday. Rumor that Saint-Quentin Has Been Occupied by German Troops.</h3>
<p>Paris – German troops continued their fierce offensive on the front lines throughout yesterday, especially between the cities of Landrecies and Guise, west of Maubeuge. The battle resulted in some further progress. The British, Belgian, and French Allied forces are now making large-scale military adjustments on the left flank, namely in northern Belgium. The situation is being kept extremely secret. Military authorities only stated that this adjustment did not encounter any difficulties and did not elaborate. In short, the war situation from the Swiss border to northern France is roughly as follows: (1) From the Swiss border to the line of Maumedy, namely the Maginot Line, there is nothing worth mentioning. (2) Between Sedan and Laon in northern France, the German army did not launch a large-scale offensive, only engaging in small-scale encounters on multiple occasions. The situation was quite intense, especially north of Rethel. After the French counterattack, they have recaptured several villages and towns. To the northwest of Laon, after a large number of German reconnaissance troops advanced, they engaged in fierce battles with the French army, but their number of tanks was limited, not as many as those fighting north of Guise and Landrecies. (3) Between the Sambre River and the Oise River, the German army has reached a certain canal and seems to be attempting to advance on Saint-Quentin. (4) Between Guise and Landrecies, the German army launched a large-scale offensive with the assistance of tanks, artillery, and aircraft. The fierce battle began yesterday and paused slightly at night. The battle resumed at dawn today. According to those in charge, the German strategy focuses on surprise attacks, but the Allied forces are now prepared and will not be caught off guard. Judging from the recent progress of the German army, which is completely different from the situation when they began to attack the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Ardennes region of France, one can understand this. (Havas Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – A French military spokesperson officially stated, "Extremely fierce fighting occurred throughout the day yesterday between Guise and Landrecies, in the northwestern part of the 'bulge'." Both sides resumed fighting this morning. French forces launched local offensives west of Rethel and between that area and Sedan, recapturing several villages and towns. In the northern part of Belgium, Allied forces are continuing to develop their strategic withdrawal movement. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Officials from the German High Command declared that the decisive stage of the European war has begun. The main battlefield may still be between Paris and Brussels, which the famous Prussian military strategist Clausewitz called the "heart of France" 110 years ago. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to reliable sources here last night, German tank units advanced towards Paris yesterday, nearing the Somme River, which is only seventy miles from Paris. Official reports state that German armored columns are advancing towards Paris from the Belgian front line, having reached the halfway point, and the northern front is becoming more stable due to the occupation of Mariakerke and Antwerp. The German News Agency claimed that a motorized unit has broken into the French forests west of the Meuse River. The news agency said, "German infantry has not lost contact and is rapidly following the vanguard." (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters has just released a war report stating, "Fierce fighting occurred on the front lines throughout the day today, especially in the area of Guise and Landrecies (northern France). Disregarding heavy losses, the enemy army is launching attacks on each of these cities with all its might. Nothing else is worth mentioning in other areas. Our bombers continued to attack enemy motorized units on the front lines, inflicting heavy damage. Reconnaissance aircraft also repeatedly flew to the front lines for reconnaissance. Many enemy aircraft have been shot down by our country's anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes." (Havas Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – It is reported that British reinforcements have been continuously crossing the French border to participate in the major battle between the Sambre and Sedan. British mechanized units have now rushed to block the front and flanks of the advancing German army. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – A French military spokesperson stated that the general impression created by the latest news from the Western Front is generally quite favorable. The Allied forces' great strategic movement north of the Sambre is continuing without being hindered or pressured by the enemy. Fierce fighting is occurring near Avesnes and west of Vervins between the Sambre and the Aisne. However, the German offensive is not as fierce as before. The major German forces may be experiencing supply difficulties due to the efforts taken by the Allied forces. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>German War Report Declares Occupation of Saint-Quentin</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon's German war report stated that after overcoming the resistance on the island of Walcheren in the Netherlands, the entire Netherlands and the Dutch-controlled European islands have completely fallen into German hands. The German army's operations in Belgium have also made significant progress. After Antwerp was occupied, the German army pressed westward against the enemy and has crossed the Scheldt River, reaching the Dender region west of Brussels. The German army continued to advance between Maubeuge and La Fère, crossed the Sambre River and the Oise River, and occupied Le Catelet and Saint-Quentin. The German army in the south has reached north of Laon and the Aisne River. Fortress 505 of the Maginot Line has been captured. The number of enemy soldiers and military supplies captured by the German army is increasing daily. Excluding the Dutch army, the number of prisoners has reached 100,000, and many large cannons have also been captured, the largest being 28 cm in caliber. The German Air Force has been very effective in assisting the army's advance. Many enemy airfields and factories have been destroyed by bombs. Near the coast of France and Belgium, an enemy ship was sunk by a bomb. The ship had a displacement of 6,000 tons. Another destroyer was severely damaged. The enemy has recently lost another 147 aircraft, most of which were destroyed by bombs while parked at airfields. In air combat, the enemy lost 47 aircraft, and 13 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. 27 German aircraft are missing. The German Air Force in Norway is still assisting the army in strictly guarding Narvik, and has sunk a 1,500-ton ship and a 6,000-ton troop transport ship. An enemy airship was shot down. Enemy aircraft bombed the northern and western coastal cities of Germany, dropping bombs, but did not hit military targets. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German military observers discussed today's war report, stating that the city of Saint-Quentin, which the German army occupied today, is located on the Somme River and has a population of 50,000. It is a key to northeastern France. The area currently under German attack is between Maubeuge and La Fère, a distance of 80 kilometers. The fortresses built by France in Maubeuge are quite close to the Belgian border and overlook the Sambre River. La Fère is also a fortified city located on the Oise River. This river and the Seine River, which runs through Paris, converge north of Paris. Now that the German army has crossed the Sambre River and the Oise River, the speed of progress can be seen at a glance. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>German Aircraft Raid Paris. London Feels Particularly Threatened.</p>
<p>Paris – Yesterday evening, air raids occurred in the Paris area. Two groups of enemy aircraft, eight in each group, attacked. Four of them have been shot down. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – German bombers raided the urban areas of Paris yesterday. The German army is now only ninety miles from the French capital. Allied forces are desperately resisting the German army's rapid advance. The German army's advance was slightly blunted yesterday, but their troops are still advancing continuously. Yesterday, two German bomber squadrons, each with sixteen aircraft, attacked here. An alarm was issued 45 minutes prior. It is not known whether the German aircraft dropped bombs, as communications are being checked. It is reported that five German aircraft were shot down by fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery. (United Press Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Geneva – According to a military correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph," German aircraft can fly from their bases in the Netherlands to London in just one hour. After bombing, they can return to their bases to load bombs, which is convenient and requires very little fuel, allowing them to carry more bombs. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>London – According to official statements, although the German Air Force has repeatedly bombed undefended cities in the Netherlands, Norway, France, and Belgium, the British government still insists on its policy of not bombing non-military targets. Rumors that the British Air Force intended to bomb civilians or non-military targets are inaccurate. Their intention is clearly to create a prelude to expanding this inhumane method into British territory. (Reuters Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Belgian Isolated Forces Still Defending Fortresses. The New Capital Suffers Bombing Again.</p>
<p>London – An official report was recently released from a certain location in Belgium, stating that the Belgian army's systematic retreat over the past two or three days has been carried out in good order. Affected by our sabotage, the enemy army has been unable to exert strong pressure, so our army's retreat has not suffered losses. This retreat action unfortunately requires the abandonment of Brussels and Antwerp. It is reported that the losses in these two cities are not significant. The forts of Liège and Namur are still resisting heroically. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Ostend – A Belgian radio station recently broadcast King Leopold III's message to the nation's soldiers, stating, "Commanders at all levels, military personnel, soldiers, and officers and soldiers of the Liège and Namur fortresses, you must defend the motherland and resist to the end. I have great expectations." The radio station then issued a statement on behalf of the people of the nation, expressing respect to the soldiers defending the forts of Namur, stating, "Your heroic resistance and determination to never surrender are admirable. This telegram is sent to express our respect to you. Your spirit of sacrifice is the inherent virtue of our nation and a model for us. We hope that you will accept our deep gratitude and continue to work hard to defend the motherland. The people of the nation pledge to be your backing." (Havas Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>A Certain Place in Belgium – After German aircraft heavily bombed the city of Ostend on the night of the 17th of this month, they bombed the city again yesterday morning. (Havas Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to responsible military authorities, three-quarters of Belgium has fallen into the hands of the German army. Only the troops on the Belgian North Sea coast are still resisting, and their capture can be expected in a matter of days. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Dutch and French Troops Withdraw from Zeeland Province. Military Structures Destroyed Without Exception.</p>
<p>London – French troops on the island of Walcheren in the Dutch province of Zeeland yesterday took the route through the Dutch city of Breskens and headed to Knokke and Zeebrugge in Belgium. In addition, the majority of the Dutch army has also crossed the Scheldt River (i.e., the Escaut River) between Vlissingen and Breskens and entered Belgium to join the troops that had already arrived in Belgium, in order to reorganize. The Dutch army is determined to continue fighting, just like during the last European war. (Havas Agency, 19th)</p>

The Dutch army also withdrew from Zeeland to make contact with the Allied forces and will continue to fight side by side. (Havas Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to German authorities in charge, the German army's capture of the Zeeland Islands marked the end of the war in the Netherlands. When the islands surrendered, the German army captured many British and French prisoners. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Minister of Information Broadcasts Speech, Says Germany is Making a Desperate Gamble, Outcome Will Inevitably Be Failure.</h3>
<p>London – Minister of Information Duff Cooper gave a broadcast speech yesterday, saying that we are now awaiting every war report with deep concern, and at the same time, we hold deep confidence. One of the reasons for this confidence is that the stakes placed by the enemy are far higher than ours. In this great war, it is not certain whether we will win or lose, but even if we lose, it does not mean that we have been defeated in this European war. If the enemy loses, then it can be said that they have already been defeated. The reason why Germany is putting all of the massive military power it has built up before and after the Nazi Party came to power into this great war is for this reason. Like a roulette game, Germany is betting all of its huge amount of money on red, and the result will be black. Thus, Germany will fall into blackness. This great war is not much different from the great wars in the last European war. Last time, Germany also started fiercely and irresistibly, and then its momentum gradually weakened. As a result, the attacker was the first to run out of strength, and the defender turned to gain an advantage. Germany has now broken through a wide line of defense, but this is not the Maginot Line, but an extension of the Maginot Line that was recently built and has never been considered impregnable. The most admirable feature of this great war is the heroic performance of the Royal Air Force. Duff Cooper then read a telegram from Paris, which said, "Every Frenchman praises the bravery of the Royal Air Force and believes that it is the main factor in saving France." Duff Cooper continued, "Our young pilots have achieved many amazing feats in the past few days. Where does their advantage in war lie? German pilots are as skilled and brave in combat as we are. So, is it because our planes are superior to German planes? But this is not the main reason. As Oliver Cromwell said, 'The best soldiers are those who know what they are fighting for and love what they know.' Our country's youth are now fighting for the freedom of mankind, so their performance is extraordinary. For example, on Friday morning, five Whirlwind aircraft on patrol encountered forty Messerschmitt Bf 110 enemy aircraft. Although the ratio of numbers was eight to one, they immediately engaged after being attacked and shot down no less than six enemy aircraft. During the battle, one Whirlwind aircraft was hit and crashed. The pilot parachuted down and returned to the airfield. Another aircraft was damaged, but the pilot still flew it back."

<h3>Twenty-One American Nations Lodge Collective Protest with Germany, Say Germany's Invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg is an Unreasonable and Brutal Act.</h3>
<p>Panama – Twenty-one American nations lodged a collective protest against Germany's aggression against the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, stating, "In accordance with the principles of international law, the American nations recognize Germany's invasion of the neutrality of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg as an unreasonable and brutal act, and call for the reconstruction of justice and fairness among all nations." This protest was first initiated by the Argentine government and was immediately endorsed by the American republics. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Night Raid on Two Major Ports in Northern Germany, Bombing Oil Depots and Warehouses.</h3>
<p>London – The Aviation Department has just released the following statement: (1) Our aircraft flew to the German ports of Hamburg and Bremen last night, bombing oil depots and other warehouses. The fuel currently used by the German army at the front lines is transported from these two ports. As a result of our bombing, several warehouses have been completely destroyed, and several others have suffered significant damage. In addition, our aircraft flew to the port of Bergen in Norway to bomb German warehouses and oil depots. (2) Our military aircraft flew to the area northwest of the city of Namur in Belgium last night, bombing various transportation routes used by the German vanguard, such as roads, railways, and important bridges, many of which were hit. (3) Our country's aircraft bombed enemy airfields set up within the borders of Belgium and strafed German transport convoys with machine guns. (4) Our patrol aircraft escorted merchant ship convoys in the North Sea and bombed German ships. One enemy ship was hit by our aircraft and suffered military damage. (Havas Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>London – According to official announcements, in the air battles in France on Friday, nine of our Whirlwind fighter planes destroyed ten German Junkers bombers, sending them crashing to the ground. At that time, twenty German aircraft were circling above a forest. The British aircraft dove down and attacked. All the Whirlwind aircraft have safely returned to their bases. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters correspondent stationed with the British Air Force in France reports that although the British Air Force's forward bases in France have been heavily damaged by the enemy, they have decided to hold on firmly. The losses suffered by the force due to low-flying German bombing are indeed huge, but they cannot shatter their fighting spirit or means of retaliation. In addition to constantly bombing German troops and other targets, British fighter planes are also carrying out large-scale interceptions south of the Sambre River, covering enemy aircraft advancing on tanks. The situation of air force operations yesterday is still unknown, but our Whirlwind aircraft engaged forty German Messerschmitt aircraft and shot down six of them. Last night, the British Air Force shot down another fifteen enemy aircraft of various types. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Achieves Repeated Successes in Battle, King George Sends Congratulations.</h3>
<p>London – The British King recently sent a telegram congratulating the British Air Force on its battle achievements, saying, "When I visited the headquarters of the bomber command, I was able to continue to hear about the heroic battle achievements of the bomber teams in recent weeks, coupled with the tireless work of the coastal forces and the valiant fighting of the fighter squadrons in this country and France, which has created an immortal history. This history includes the entire Empire, because its children are now achieving results in the army, navy, and air force. I congratulate the Air Force now and predict its future continued victory. Its spirit of invincibility makes the final victory of the Allies even more reliable." (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>London City Area Strictly Fortified, Residents' Lives Normal.</h3>
<p>London – Last night, London was filled with machine gun posts with sandbags. The British people felt the threat of foreign invasion for the first time since 1066. Fully armed troops guarded the important cities of the country. The roads and waterways connecting to London were also laid with barbed wire and patrolled by troops. Patrol cars were running back and forth in London, checking those who violated the rules of dimming lights and preventing signals from the "Fifth Column" collaborators. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>London – London residents and the general British public are now reading war news with firm determination. Their daily lives are as normal as usual and have not been disturbed by the war. Theaters and cinemas are full. Traffic on roads and railways is also as usual. Apart from newspapers and announcements, as well as soldiers on the roads and barrage balloons in the air, the whole city maintains a state of quietness. Saturday evening newspapers still focused on sports news, interspersed with war reports from France and Belgium. The average Briton expressed concern about the German "breakthrough" into the Allied lines, but all are convinced that the current setbacks are only temporary. They feel at ease in view of the Royal Air Force's bright and brave performance. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>City of Paris in a State of War.</h3>
<p>Geneva – According to news received here from Paris, the French capital has recently fallen into a state of panic again, just like in 1871 and 1914. The French people all recognize that the German army is actively advancing on Paris. People are ordered to stay indoors as much as possible in order to organize supplies and stockpile food. Countless refugees from the north were transported to the Gare du Nord yesterday. Banks and large stores have begun to move to safer areas. Several Parisian newspapers have made preparations to move to Marseille, Toulouse, and other places to publish. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Milan – According to the "Corriere della Sera," the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in France are prepared to leave Paris. All embassies are packing their luggage. The general public expects that a fierce battle near Paris may determine the outcome within 48 hours. It is said that there are differences of opinion within the British and French general staffs. The British side advocates stopping the German army from occupying the English Channel coast at any cost, while General Gamelin insists on withdrawing troops from Belgian territory to protect Paris. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Milan – The Paris municipal authorities have assured the citizens that various measures have been taken for protection and supply, and residents should maintain a calm attitude. Any theft activities will be punished by firing squad by a military court in accordance with the special decree issued yesterday. (Haitong Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>London Smashes "Fifth Column" Organization, Secretly Plots to Sabotage Water and Electricity Transportation, French and Belgian Farmers Strictly Guard Against Paratroopers.</h3>
<p>London – Yesterday's news: British intelligence discovered an organized "Fifth Column" group yesterday. It is reported that the group is planning to occupy various power plants, radio stations, and carry out railway sabotage. It is reported that this case was cracked based on clues provided by the Netherlands. The group includes many German men and women secretly sent to Britain by the German side, as well as detailed maps of various British factories, telephone lines, and water plants. (United Press Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – The farmers of France and Belgium are now also following the army and engaging in war work, but the work of these people is behind the front lines, attacking German paratrooper teams. Many farmers always carry guns with them while working in the fields and tending livestock. A reporter recently traveled and saw that even women were standing on the streets of villages and towns with pistols in their hands to watch the air battles. Once, an aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft artillery and caught fire. The wreckage broke into pieces and fell to the ground. One piece of aircraft wreckage fell slowly, very much like a parachute gliding down. The farmers were all extremely angry and fired their guns into the air, regardless of whether the target was identified. But in the end, the wreckage that fell was a broken wing of an aircraft. Although thousands of German paratroopers have been killed in mid-air or on land while descending into French and Belgian territory, the number and work of these paratroopers have not been reduced as a result. They land every night, but these paratroopers, due to attacks by the people of France and Belgium, no longer dare to land during the day and have switched to night raids. The Allied people's vigilance is not without reason, because they now know the German use of spies. The duties of German spies are to infiltrate the rear of the Allied forces for reconnaissance and quickly report the movements of the Allied forces and the positions of the artillery teams to the German General Staff, so that the German side can change its battle plans. The German paratrooper teams are also a type of spy. Some members of the paratrooper teams wear Allied military uniforms and disguise themselves as Allied soldiers, while others dress up as priests, workers, or farmers. It is not easy for the Allied forces to inspect all priests, workers, and farmers one by one, so German spies can easily mix among them. Once these paratroopers land safely, the danger has passed and they can work with peace of mind. According to an official from the French intelligence department, the German side has more than 25,000 of these adventurous paratroopers who sacrifice their lives, and they are all young people.

<h3>Surrender of Dutch Troops: The Course of Events</h3>
<p>London: The Dutch Embassy in London issued a communiqué today explaining the course of the Dutch army's surrender, and describing in detail Prince Bernhard's recent return to the country to inspect the province of Zeeland. It stated, in brief, that Prince Bernhard, on the order of Queen Wilhelmina, returned from London to his country's province of Zeeland on the 16th of this month for inspection. The soldiers and civilians of the province were extremely excited. In addition to inspecting the defense forces, the Prince explained to them the reasons for the surrender of the main land forces in various locations. Because Germany used illegal and barbaric warfare methods, the Dutch army was no longer able to continue resisting. At the very beginning of the outbreak of war, the Dutch military authorities believed that Allied British and French forces would be passing through a certain bridge, so it was not destroyed. Unexpectedly, the German side was well aware of the strategic value of this bridge and secretly dispatched troops disguised as Dutch soldiers to seize the bridge. Later, they transported reinforcements by seaplane to strengthen the defenses. At the same time, paratroopers assisted in the operations, allowing them to cross the Dutch defense line and attack the rear of the defending troops in the flooded area. It can be seen that the loss of this bridge became the deciding factor in the entire war situation. In addition, the German army used the same strategy to occupy the island of Dordrecht and the port of Rotterdam. Then, using Dutch prisoners as a vanguard, they advanced. Furthermore, fifteen ambulances of the Dutch Red Cross were hit by incendiary bombs dropped by enemy planes. While Red Cross personnel were rescuing the wounded from the destroyed ambulances, enemy planes strafed them with machine guns. Their cruel behavior can be seen in this instance.

<h3>German Troops in Narvik Isolated</h3>
<p>Paris: The German attempt to rescue Narvik from Trondheim by sea has failed. According to news from the Narvik front, many German transport ships have been sunk or captured by Allied warships. Refugees arriving at the Swedish border say that the Allied air force is clearly superior to the German air force in the Narvik area. In one air battle, several German planes were shot down. Currently, the only way for German troops to retreat from Narvik is through the Swedish border, but there is also the possibility of being blocked by Allied forces. The city is now effectively in Allied hands, and they are pursuing German troops retreating towards the border north of the city. Naval vessels are constantly bombarding, and aircraft are constantly flying overhead. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Mussolini Hesitates and Observes: Mediterranean Situation Temporarily Eases; Roosevelt's Reply Lacks Definitive Language; Extreme Concern over Balkan Situation</h3>
<p>Rome: The intentions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini regarding the Western Front remain elusive. The general expectation in Rome was that Italy would inevitably intervene militarily shortly after Germany launched a large-scale attack on the democracies of Western Europe. However, the German offensive has been underway for ten days and has achieved initial victories, yet Italy remains inactive and there is no sign that it will change its policy in the immediate future. According to certain observers, the moment of Italian action is not as imminent as generally believed. At least for the time being, it will likely continue to harass Britain and France, rather than act rashly, as the current war is bound to be protracted. Britain and France hold strong positions in the Mediterranean and are not easily intimidated. Furthermore, if Italy joins the war, Turkey will inevitably aid Britain and France, and Yugoslavia may also fight against Italy. On the other hand, the United States has reacted strongly to Germany's invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, which has deeply impressed Italian political figures, who believe that the possibility of American intervention has increased. At the same time, Italy does not want to disrupt the balance of power in Europe solely to benefit Germany. All of these factors cause the Italian authorities to hesitate and deliberate, rather than take hasty action. The reason for the contradiction and hesitation in Italian policy lies in this.

<p>Rome: Some believe that the news that the Italian ship "Rex" passed through Gibraltar en route to Naples without being inspected for contraband indicates a slight easing of tensions between Britain and Italy. However, this news has not been published in any newspapers. What has been reported is a dispatch from Genoa stating that the Italian ship "Roma" was detained in Gibraltar for as long as thirty hours, and many tons of kerosene were confiscated. British officers conducted a very strict inspection. The dispatch did not mention that the inspection of the ship took place on May 6th. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome: Renowned Italian journalist Gayda published an article in "Giornale d'Italia," stating that Italy is closely monitoring the political situation in the Balkans, and the Balkan coast is of great importance to Italy, as this coast has many naval bases. The Italian coast is very shallow, from Venice to Durazzo, making it vulnerable to attack. Therefore, the defense of Italy's east coast depends on the military and political situation on the west coast of the Balkans. Italy is extremely concerned about the political and military attitudes, diplomatic policies, and various constraints of the Balkan countries. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Italy Full of Mockery Towards the Allied Forces</h3>
<p>Rome: This morning, the Italian radio station, broadcasting news in French, commented on the British War Office's statement that the British army suffered no losses during its retreat from Antwerp, stating sarcastically that the British army fled, disregarding the Belgian army. Knowing that fighting should not lead to desertion, it is lamentable for the future of the French people if France, as a co-belligerent, considers "retreat without losses" a fortunate event.

<h3>American Aircraft Production Surges; America Can Become World's Largest Air Force Country in One Year</h3>
<p>Los Angeles: Leaders in the American aviation industry recently stated that as a result of large-scale production last year in response to British and French demand, they can use this experience to make America the world's largest air force country within a year. According to Zwieta, president of the New York Aviation Association, America's military buildup began last year, and the large amount of British and French orders received in recent months has greatly developed our productivity, greatly improved our technology, and expanded our operations. We do not feel any difficulty. The existing forty-five aircraft factories only need to double the area of each factory, double the area of the aviation machinery manufacturing plants, double the number of workers, and adopt a twenty-four-hour work standard to complete the 50,000 aircraft stipulated in President Roosevelt's defense plan.

<h3>War Situation Extremely Serious; Partial Cabinet Reshuffle in France; Diplomatic Personnel Transferred to Increase Activity; Pétain Assists Military Affairs with Associate Status</h3>
<p>Paris: Prime Minister Reynaud gave a radio address tonight, announcing a partial cabinet reshuffle. At the same time, he reported that after German mechanized forces broke through French positions south of the Meuse River, they made slight progress again today. He stated, in part, "The duty of the government lies in action, and what the people expect from the government is practical action, not empty words. At this moment, what we never forget is the sacrifice of the soldiers, the suffering of their families, the displacement of refugees, and the innocent civilians who have been subjected to enemy air raids. In the face of this grave situation, our people can disregard their personal suffering and work together to overcome national difficulties. This is truly the greatness of the French nation. I reported to you yesterday that German mechanized forces had broken into our country south of the Meuse River and created a salient in our army's positions. As of today, this salient has made slight progress to the west. The situation at this moment is indeed very critical, but not hopeless. I believe that now is the time for the French nation to show its strength. For this reason, we have decided to partially reshuffle the cabinet in order to strengthen our forces. First, General Pétain, the 'Victor of Verdun,' returned to Paris this morning from the Spanish capital and has joined the cabinet as an associate and Minister without Portfolio. He will surely be able to make great contributions to assist military affairs and achieve final victory. Second, under the current circumstances, the Prime Minister must bear the responsibility for national defense. Therefore, from today onwards, I will concurrently serve as Minister of National Defense and Minister of War, and Mr. Daladier will be transferred to Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Mandel will be transferred to Minister of the Interior. [Mandel was a close associate of the late 'Tiger Premier' Clemenceau.] Third, the government has decided to transfer diplomatic personnel to enhance effectiveness, and the list will be announced shortly. In short, all of our country's institutions must adapt to wartime needs, and the spirit of war must be above all else. All citizens, whether serving in the military or working in the rear, must strive to fight and vow to defeat the enemy." (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: Political figures here especially approve of the reshuffling of the cabinet, particularly the appointment of General Pétain, the ambassador to Spain, to the cabinet, and the transfer of Colonial Minister Mandel to Minister of the Interior. General Pétain (now 84 years old) is a famous general from the last European war, and from now on, as an associate of the cabinet and Minister without Portfolio, he will be able to make great contributions to military affairs. As for Mandel, he is known for his resoluteness and decisiveness, and after being transferred to Minister of the Interior, he will be able to deal with the internal treachery of the so-called "Fifth Column" with the greatest determination. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: The government recently transferred Ambassador Roux to the Holy See in the Vatican to be Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the original Secretary-General, Léger, will be transferred to other important positions. Roux is a veteran of the diplomatic world, and previously served as Minister to Czechoslovakia in 1926, and in 1932, was promoted to Ambassador to the Holy See. He is a researcher at the Académie Française and has written many historical books, including one on the history of Egypt, which is the most famous. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris: The transfer of French Ambassador to the Holy See Roux to the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been commented on by diplomatic figures. When Prime Minister Reynaud gave a radio address last night, he mentioned the transfer of diplomatic personnel to enhance effectiveness, and this move is probably the beginning. After Roux and Ambassador to Spain General Pétain are successively recalled, other important diplomats will also be transferred. The new Secretary-General Roux is familiar with various political issues in Central Europe. Later, during his tenure as Ambassador to the Holy See, the relationship between the Holy See and France was extremely close. They shared a common belief in defending human characteristics and national independence, which Pope Pius XII reiterated last December. Prime Minister Reynaud also recently spoke of "defending the Latin nations and Christian civilization." The reason why Italy hesitates and does not align with the German pagans is because of this shared characteristic of French and Italian civilization. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Summary of the War Situation – Starting from the Norway Campaign</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to responsible officials from military authorities, the 37th week of the war is described to the Haitong News Agency as follows: When German troops were stationed in Narvik, Norway, the British and French launched joint attacks from the north and south. After a month, German troops bravely fought back, repelling the British and French Allied forces and the Norwegian army, which retreated north. German troops completely occupied central and northern Norway. Northern England and Narvik are 270 kilometers apart. The German troops in Narvik succeeded with the assistance of the air force. During that week, one destroyer and three transport ships of the British fleet docked in Narvik were hit and sunk, while two cruisers and two destroyers were also bombed and damaged. The port of Narvik was completely destroyed, and the railway from Narvik to the Swedish border was also destroyed. On May 10th, German troops began attacking the Western Front, from the southernmost part of Luxembourg to the mouth of the Eem River on the North Sea, a line 450 kilometers long. Luxembourg was completely occupied within a day, and the Netherlands followed suit. Belgium also fell into German hands after a few days, and the front line extended to Leuven and Namur.</p>
<p>By May 16th, German troops had occupied a total of 67,000 square kilometers of the Netherlands, and 50,000 square kilometers each of Belgium and Luxembourg. The line of German advance on the Western Front was shortened from 450 kilometers to 250 kilometers.</p>
<p>As German troops continued to capture the Meuse River and Sedan, invading northern France, Belgium built modern, strong artillery and the strongest fortifications of Liège on the banks of the river. Although they all fell into the hands of the Allied forces, the Allied forces failed to provide assistance to Belgium and the Netherlands. The southern wing of the Dutch army lost contact with the northern wing of the Belgian army, and the Dutch army finally surrendered to Germany on May 14th. The German air force exerted its power, protecting the northern wing of the German army, while bombing the British army on the southern coast of the Netherlands. In the first six days, the German air force sank many enemy ships. At the same time, the German air force flew to contain the British troops assisting the Netherlands and the British and French Allied forces assisting Belgium. The German air force then engaged in air battles with enemy aircraft over Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, shooting down three to four hundred enemy aircraft. In addition, Germany landed paratroopers in the airfields of Belgium and the Netherlands, so Rotterdam and Antwerp were able to be occupied. The German army then occupied the first Belgian fort, Eben-Emael, with the latest weapons. The German air force assisted the tank and mechanized units north of Namur in attacking the enemy army. This was the situation on May 13th.</p>
<p>On May 14th and 15th, German troops crossed the Meuse River south of Namur and Sedan in northern France. German troops launched a fierce attack on the French army, and finally repelled the French army. In the south of Sedan, the French army participated with 90-ton tanks, which they considered to be such heavy weapons that they would be invincible, but they were ultimately forced to withdraw from the battlefield by the power of the German air force.</p>
<p>During the first six days of the war, the German air force had significant achievements. The German air force shot down a total of 1,350 to 1,500 enemy aircraft. In the following days, enemy aircraft suffered fewer casualties, as the German air force went to bomb the enemy's rear.</p>
<p>After this, the enemy will launch a decisive battle in Antwerp, the Leie River, Namur, the east bank of the Meuse River, and Sedan. The Dyle Line has been broken through, and Mechelen, Leuven, and Brussels have been occupied. The French advance has been blocked. The battle situation on the Maginot Line and the Meuse River can be deeply observed for the momentum of the German advance. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Mechanized Troops Go All In; Only One Division Not Deployed</h3>
<p>New York: According to the "New York Post," highly placed sources in Washington received unconfirmed telephone messages from equally highly placed sources in Paris stating that the French authorities are certain that all but one of Germany's twelve mechanized divisions have joined the fighting and have suffered losses. More than 1,500 German planes have been shot down. Germany's expenditure of its strength in this way means that it will not be able to organize such a large-scale assault again. Therefore, although the overall situation is extremely serious, the French government remains confident that whoever can contain Hitler in this large-scale war will never find peace.

<h3>Former German Emperor Still Resides in the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to a Haitong News Agency reporter, former German Emperor Wilhelm II is currently still in Doorn, Netherlands. The news about Wilhelm moving to Potsdam or East Prussia is unfounded. There is no fighting in the Doorn area. Wilhelm II's fourth son, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, spoke with his father by telephone last night. Wilhelm said that his health was as usual, and the German authorities have guaranteed him all kinds of protection. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>US Senate Expedites National Defense Budget</h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate Committee was busy yesterday processing President Roosevelt's national defense bill. It is widely believed that the entire military budget of $3,131,472,651 will be submitted for discussion at the beginning of this week. This is the highest amount of American military spending. After obtaining a simple report, the Senate Military Subcommittee increased the Army Department's financial budget to $1,827,491,724. At the same time, the Senate Naval Committee is also quickly preparing a budget of $1,303,980,927 for expanding the fleet and naval strength. In addition to President Roosevelt's emergency budget, these two bills include the annual expenses of the Army and Navy Departments. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>American Prices Continue to Plummet; Speculators Reap What They Sow; European War Blocks Sales, Forcing Further Liquidation; Speculators Have Already Lost Over 50 Million</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the general speculators of this city have been heavily buying foreign exchange and foreign stocks, and hoarding goods from Europe and America. After the outbreak of the European war, these speculators turned their speculative targets to hoarding American goods and buying American stocks and US dollars. Recently, the US dollar has been rising sharply, and they have already lost a lot. In addition, the easing of foreign exchange has greatly affected the decline in commodity prices, so the misfortune of these speculators is like a leaky house in a continuous downpour. Due to the sharp drop in stocks and the continuous decline in commodity prices in the United States, they have suffered even more severe blows and suffered huge losses. As of last Friday, the major Shanghai speculators with strong capital have lost at least more than 20 million yuan in the decline of American stocks and commodity prices alone.</p>
<p>Stocks and Commodity Prices Continue to Plummet</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, a certain foreign firm in this city received a telegram yesterday stating that stocks and commodity prices in the New York market in the United States continued to plummet last Saturday. As of the day before yesterday (Saturday), various US stocks have fallen by an average of about 20%, and the stocks with the largest declines have fallen by more than 40%. Even military industrial stocks are showing a downward trend. As for the market prices of general goods, regardless of their type, they have generally fallen by an average of 20%.</p>
<p>Chinese Suffer Unprecedented Losses</p>
<p>Therefore, the losses suffered by general Chinese speculators in Shanghai have exceeded 20 to 30 million yuan. According to estimates by well-known foreign business enterprise financial institutions in this city, the losses are at least about 3 million US dollars, equivalent to 54 million yuan in national currency. Although they once made huge profits when the black market US dollar was priced at six yuan, they have now suffered such a blow, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. It is rare for Shanghai Chinese merchants to suffer such huge losses from speculation, but it is also because Shanghai Chinese merchants are engaged in speculative hoarding as much as they are today. Moreover, with the decline in American commodity prices, the market prices of other foreign goods and even Chinese domestic goods will also collapse. Therefore, the losses of large and small speculators in this city this time are extremely large.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Liquidation Lies in the European War</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the decline in American stocks and commodity prices, (1) the sharp drop in stocks is due to the impact of the European war. The major American companies are popular all over the world, and their industries and companies are also spread everywhere. This expansion of the European war will inevitably cause considerable losses to the various branches affected by the war, which will in turn affect the stock prices of the parent company. (2) The slump in commodity prices is also due to the impact of the war. The largest customers for American exports have always been Asia and Europe. The war in the Far East is still ongoing, and the European war has also started and is expanding, resulting in a stagnation of American export trade, which eventually led to devaluation.</p>

<p>Japanese General Honjo Shigeru will come to China recently to inspect the situation of the Japanese army in Central China. It is reported that Honjo has left Japan with 13 important members of the vehicle department in recent days, first to North China, and then to Shanghai to inspect Central China. Honjo was formerly the commander of the Kwantung Army.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Trade Gradually Becomes Difficult</h3>
<p>There are more than 50 Fuzhou merchants engaged in import and export trade in Shanghai, among which Yunzhang Shenzhuang, Chenxiji, Jiankang, and Xianxin are the largest. Before the first half of last year, the value of imported goods (transported to Fujian) was as high as 7 million yuan per month, and the value of exported goods (transported from Fujian to Shanghai) was about 4 million yuan (according to imports, foreign cloth, cotton yarn, and kerosene are the main commodities, followed by foreign groceries; exports are mainly timber). However, since the second half of last year, business has sharply decreased, with imported goods falling to less than 3 million yuan. According to the Fuzhou merchants who spoke to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, since</p>
<p>Last Summer</p>
<p>Japanese warships have repeatedly detained cargo ships and obstructed navigation outside the mouth of the Min River, or even confiscated the goods. Therefore, since the second half of last year, all cargo ships passing between Min and Shanghai have had to detour through Sandu or Xinghua, and go through a week of land transportation. Therefore, the freight cost of import and export goods between Min and Shanghai has almost exceeded two-thirds of the original price, so the price has soared and business has declined. This is one reason. Secondly, Fuzhou has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese planes recently, and residents have evacuated to the suburbs one after another, so the demand has decreased. This is the second reason. In addition, recently, various shipping companies have repeatedly increased water feet, such as the Charon Company, which</p>
<p>Increased a Month Ago</p>
<p>The water foot increased by 25%, and now it will increase by 25% again, resulting in soaring prices of import and export goods, which is also the third reason for the decline in business. It is also learned that recently, the Fujian provincial authorities, in order to prevent Japanese goods from entering the mainland, require all imported goods to be registered in advance, and the import of cloth must be issued a memorandum by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Recently, because of this procedure, the Fuzhou merchants are negotiating with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and there has been no result, so Shanghai cloth cannot be imported, and it has been more than a month. The Fuzhou business is even more bleak.</p>

<h3>Refusing to Mark Prices on Goods; Citizens Launch a Mass Sanction; The French Concession Police Department Strictly Investigates Price Gouging and Malpractice in Weights and Measures; There Have Been Many Cases</h3>
<p>Merchants control commodity prices, disregarding the hardship of the Fujianese. The authorities of the concession have delayed the implementation of price marking and trading methods. They are greedy for profit and forget righteousness, which is regrettable. The various city and Fujian groups in this city have decided on four measures to notify the city and Fujian to abide by them in order to show resistance: (1) In this autumn of high commodity prices, reduce consumption as much as possible and save material resources. Clothes do not have to be new, but they must be able to cover the body and be neat. Do not seek to be overfed or extravagant, but seek to maintain nutrition. Other supplies must be saved as much as possible. Everything should be based on the principle of buying less and using less. (2) If you must buy goods, you must choose to buy from merchants that have implemented price marking. Do not deal with merchants that do not change prices. (3) Promote cooperative purchase of necessities to reduce intermediary exploitation. (4) If you encounter hoarding or high prices, you should immediately report to the concession authorities for sanctions. It is also claimed by the Price Stabilization Committee that the plan for managing the rice market and supplying cheap coal to poor households formulated by the subcommittees on rice channels will be announced shortly.</p>
<p>The French Concession Will Implement the Plan</p>
<p>It is learned that one or two days before the general meeting of the Price Stabilization Association of the French Concession was held on the 9th of this month, the delegation of the Price Stabilization Association set off to inspect the vegetable markets in the French Concession and found that the prices of important foods had not been raised. For example, the selling price of pork was the same as the price list announced on the 3rd of this month, and the price of lard was even 20% cheaper. The same was true for fish and vegetable markets. The three plans passed by the Price Stabilization Association of the French Concession on the 9th were: (1) Adopting methods to improve the conditions of the rice market and the coal market. The methods for cracking down on the rice market formulated by the association will be published within a week, and the greatest efforts have been made to continue to supply cheap coal to benefit the poor. (2) Reorganizing the vegetable markets in the French Concession. A part of the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market has been designated for the exclusive sale of food for foreigners. The slaughterhouse has also been inspected, and the order and cleanliness are still good. (3) Controlling the price of bread. After studying the combination and quantity of bread manufacturing, the association decided to consult with the bread merchants in the French Concession to manage the bread market in the future. It is also learned that the association has obtained the cooperation of an agency that can estimate wholesale prices, and will further control retail prices. Since the source is the main reason for the competition, close attention has also been paid to the dredging of the source.</p>
<p>There Have Been Many Cases of Inspection</p>
<p>The public can report to the designated six police stations any incidents of excessively high prices of daily necessities or malpractice found in weights and measures or the quality of goods. Therefore, the French Concession has strict supervision over food. Those who have been reported are: (1) Meat: 42 cases of selling buffalo, 1 case of selling second-class meat, and 29 other cases. (2) There are many cases of forgery of beverages. Those who have been punished include those who used a large number of fuels to produce colored products and sold them under the name of Medoe high-grade wine, and were fined 500 yuan. Those who used inferior alcohol to sell under the name of Martel brandy were fined 200 yuan. Those who sold alcoholic beverages of unknown origin were fined 35 yuan and 50 yuan respectively. The Price Stabilization Association is now thoroughly investigating and dealing with merchants who raised the prices of their inventories due to the tight foreign exchange, but still did not reduce prices after the foreign exchange was released. According to the Price Stabilization Association, from April 15 to May 3, the French Concession Police Department conducted 85 inspections of the weights and measures used by merchants in the French Concession. Among these, 23 stores were punished for using counterfeit weights and measures, and the fines ranged from 20 yuan to 100 yuan. The French Concession Police Department discovered some cases in the premises of illegal merchants, including installing wooden boards or lead blocks at the bottom of the measuring instrument to reduce the capacity, and drilling holes in the weighing instrument to suppress the weight. The association hopes that the public will pay attention. If anyone discovers such illegal incidents, they should immediately report to the police station.</p>
<p>Recommendations for Preferential Treatment of Internal Capital Transfer</p>
<p>The market is full of floating capital, which fuels speculation and threatens people's livelihood. People with insight have long advocated the internal transfer of capital to meet the needs of national construction. Although the advocacy has been long, there are no concrete facts and methods. Therefore, the harm of floating capital in the market remains the same, and the people's livelihood difficulties have not been alleviated. It is estimated that there are about 30 billion yuan of floating capital in Shanghai, most of which is used for speculative hoarding. The failure of capital to be used properly is a major loss to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Here are two suggestions from an economist on how to transfer capital internally, which can be used for reference: (1) A consortium should organize the Xifu Northwest Enterprise Company, which specializes in accepting this trust deposit in Shanghai for the purpose of operating businesses in the interior. For depositors of this trust deposit, the consortium guarantees an annual interest rate of 7%. If there is a profit, the depositors and the consortium share it equally. This interest and profit are paid in Shanghai, without the need for internal remittance, eliminating the trouble of quota rebates. (2) The Four Banks and other well-known banks should promote the method of transferring deposits to the interior. All Shanghai branch depositors who are willing to transfer their deposits to the inland branches of the Shanghai branch are allowed to designate the location for the transfer. The interest rate is higher than that of the Shanghai branch, and the interest is paid by the Shanghai branch at each interest payment period, without the need for internal remittance, eliminating the trouble of quotas and rebates. The above methods can allow those who have no interest and experience in inland enterprises to gradually transfer their savings to the inland.</p>
<h3>Japanese Toa Dobun Shoin Students Investigate Various Places</h3>
<p>Students from the Japanese Toa Dobun Shoin in this city will recently be divided into 26 teams to investigate resources and general conditions in the occupied areas and various places. Their destinations are the Yangtze River Basin, and Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hainan Island, etc. Hong Kong is also one of the investigation locations.</p>
<h3>Six Major Cities in Japan Implement Sugar Rationing; In Addition, the Daily Use of Matches is Limited to Five; The Suffering of the People is Obvious</h3>
<p>Dalu News reported that the Japanese government has decided to implement a system of rationing sugar and matches in six major cities in the country, namely Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Kobe, and Yokohama, starting from June 1. Each person is allowed to receive half a pound of sugar and two small boxes of matches (equivalent to five matches per day) per month. The general Japanese people have mixed opinions on this, and they are deeply afraid that the rationing system will not be limited to the above two items, and it is doubtful whether the quantity stipulated by the government is sufficient. It is found that the Japanese government has not yet achieved satisfactory results in dealing with the supply and demand of major items, so the people are quite suspicious of the Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiwara's claim that the rationing system for food and matches can be carried out smoothly. The newspaper strongly urged the Fujianese not to take the opportunity to hoard sugar and matches.</p>
<h3>British Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China Came to Shanghai from Hong Kong for Inspection; He Also Had to Go to North China for a Routine Inspection; Chinese Enthusiastically Donated to Belgium</h3>
<p>British Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China General Grasett left Hong Kong on the 18th to come to the north, first arriving in Shanghai to have some contacts with the British military authorities in Shanghai. At that time, he may summon British Commander of the Army in Shanghai Major General Simmons and inspect the British army in Shanghai, and then go north to Tianjin and North China for a routine inspection.</p>
<p>Shanghai British Children Died for the Country</p>
<p>The Western child Norbleston, who once studied at the Shanghai Municipal Council School, served the Air Force of the motherland on March 26 this year. According to news from Shanghai, Norbleston unfortunately died for the country. It is said that Norbleston's parents are still alive. His father used to work for the Water Company, and later retired due to old age and returned to England with his family. Norbleston was married to Ms. Lauter of Walsh. During his studies in Shanghai, he was a sports athlete and was good at boxing. He was quite famous in the school.</p>
<p>The British Side Announced Wartime Donations</p>
<p>After the countries of the British and French Allied Line successively declared war on Germany on September 3 last year, the British official in Shanghai established a society for centralized wartime fundraising, which aimed to enrich the wartime fund. The French side also set up a fundraising association to comfort the soldiers on the front line due to Mrs. Ingor's call, and held dances at the French Ball Federation to raise funds. According to the British official disclosure, from September to December last year, a total of 395,155.85 yuan in French currency and 4.402-5-6 pounds in British currency were raised. However, those raised in mid-April of this year totaled 691,107 yuan in French currency and 12,590 pounds in British currency. All the above donations have been remitted to the motherland.</p>
<p>Belgian Apartments Sent Letters to German Overseas Chinese to Move</p>
<p>Dalu News reported that the Belgian Church in this city issued a circular on the 18th of this month, instructing all German residents in the apartments of the church to move out as soon as possible. The people who received the letter will all comply. It is said that the Belgian Church has a large amount of real estate in the French Concession. The apartments it operates include the Asturiet Apartments at the intersection of Huanlong Road and Meyer Shea Road, and the Alberty Road Apartments at the intersection of Albert Road and Lafayette Road. There are many German residents.</p>
<p>Chinese People Donated to Belgium One After Another</p>
<p>Since the wife of the Belgian Ambassador to China, Mrs. Jiumu, initiated a fundraising campaign to help Belgian refugees, people from all walks of life in Shanghai and abroad have been enthusiastically donating due to the drive of sympathy. The first batch of Belgian currency raised was 31,850 francs, 5 pounds in British gold, 500 francs in French gold, 285 US dollars, and 59,786 yuan in Chinese currency. The second batch raised 5 pounds in British gold, 1,000 francs in French gold, which was donated by Robert Maze, the Chief of the General Customs Administration, 225 US dollars, and 16,468 yuan in Chinese currency, of which Zhu Hexiang donated 200 yuan, Woodhead donated 100 yuan, and there were two other Chinese people who each donated 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>American and Italian Cruise Ships Still Sail to Europe and America</p>
<p>The world situation is changing, and the European war is becoming more serious. However, cruise ships of the United States and Italy are still sailing as usual, ensuring the shipping between Shanghai and Europe and the United States. According to shipping industry sources, during the outbreak of the European war, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium were all swept into the whirlpool. Although merchant ships of these countries in the Far East can sail, they have been divided into wartime blockades in the Atlantic and cannot sail. Currently, the only ships that are still sailing to Europe and the United States and to Shanghai in the Far East are the ships of the American Mail Steamship Company and the Italian Cruise Line Company. It is learned that the American Mail Ship President Polk has decided to export from Shanghai on the 23rd to start the world class, and the President Taft will also sail from Shanghai to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu, etc. in the United States on the same day. As for the Italian Mail Ship Conte Verde, it is also scheduled to sail south from Shanghai on June 9 to Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Genoa, etc. It is heard that if the Mediterranean situation is tense during the voyage to Europe and the United States by the American and Italian ships, it is planned to detour around the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>The British and Italian Defense Zones Are Very Quiet</p>
<p>As the European war is deteriorating and the situation in the Mediterranean is becoming more serious, the participation of Italy in the war is imminent. The situation in the areas where the troops of various countries are stationed in the west of Shanghai in this city is inevitably becoming serious. However, until the fundraising, the situation in the area is extremely calm and peaceful. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inspected yesterday, there were no changes in the Italian army stationed along Robinson Road and the British army camp on Great West Road. The armed sentries at Fendoukou were also stationed as usual, and there was no tense atmosphere. The British flag was still hanging on the flagpole next to the British sentry post at the northern end of Kaixuan Road and Lujia Road, and was fluttering in the wind. The south of Lujia Road was guarded by French soldiers, and the middle was densely covered with barbed wire fences, and the situation was extremely quiet.</p>

<h3>Japan Has No Troops to Transfer; It Trains Young Soldiers in Shanghai; They All Cried When They Were Dispatched; Many Wounded Soldiers from the Front Line Were Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Japanese side in the Nanshi area originally designated the area west of Rihui Port as the area for the garrison troops, and the area west of Rihui Port was purely an open and safe area, so there were very few garrison troops. However, recently, the mobile warfare in various places on the East Battlefield has begun, and all of them are regular army units, and the guerrilla forces in the suburbs of this city are also very active. Therefore, recently, the Japanese army has transferred wounded and newly arrived young soldiers to Nanshi for training, and they will be dispatched to various places for reinforcement immediately. Currently, the buildings west of Rihui Port, such as the Gaochang Temple Waterworks, are full of people. Many have been transferred to the garrison in recent days, and the soldiers all cried when they were about to leave. At the same time, a large number of wounded soldiers were transported back from various battle lines. Military vehicles were covered with tarpaulins to avoid being seen. The Zhongshan Sanatorium and Taikang Biscuit Factory on Longhua Road and Damuqiao were full of wounded soldiers. Therefore, those who pass west of Rihui Port must have a pass from the military department.</p>
<h3>Youth Writing Association Announces Essay Contest Results</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Youth Writing Association has actively promoted various association affairs.

There were more than 200 entries, many of which were carefully crafted masterpieces, lengthy works, exposing fallacies, and interspersing with sincere opinions. This also proves the firm belief and loyalty of the youth in the isolated island community, and they will never be confused by heresies. All the submitted articles have been reviewed in detail by experts and ranked in order, and each submitter will be notified separately to receive bonuses and royalties.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Trade from January to April This Year</h3>
<p>Surplus of Over 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>After the Chinese government adjusted its foreign trade, the trade deficit decreased sharply, the trade improved, and it made every effort to eliminate the trade deficit of the Shanghai Customs. Regarding the trade of the Shanghai Customs from January to April this year, the import of foreign goods was 24,462,3757 yuan, and the export of local goods was 36,569,9429 yuan, with a surplus of 12,107,5672 yuan. In the same period last year, imports were 18,281,6991 yuan, exports were 11,257,4715 yuan, and the deficit was 70,242,576 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Life of Rickshaw Pullers - We Should Offer Sympathy and Assistance, Just Don't Haggle Excessively When Riding</h3>
<p>— Zheng Qing</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting hotter, and everyone is busy with epidemic prevention. The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association is also holding its usual summer hygiene meeting.</p>
<p>Such gatherings, probably except for those in the rickshaw pullers' circle, are not much noticed by the public, and naturally, there is even less interest in them. However, this is indeed a social problem worthy of attention. Moreover, although it may be considered a backward transportation industry, at present, it is still a purely national capital enterprise that should be maintained! There are 9,600 rickshaws in the Public Concession and about 10,000 in the French Concession. There are 44,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession and more than 50,000 in the French Concession. Excluding the occupied Nanshi and Zhabei, just in the two concessions alone, we can see about 100,000 rickshaw pullers everywhere we go (it is said that many have recently returned to their hometowns to farm). They occupy a huge and important number in transportation and manual labor sectors, so we absolutely cannot underestimate them, and we should do our best to offer sympathy and assistance. This is extremely easy to do; when we ride in their rickshaws, just don't intentionally or unintentionally haggle excessively! If you slightly raise a hand, their lives will directly benefit.</p>
<p>If you don't mind me being long-winded, life and hygiene are two sides of the same coin. Now, let's first talk about the lives of the rickshaw pullers I interviewed. Of the four essentials of life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—they only need two—food and housing. Let's talk about food first: they can no longer simplify it further. Their hands often replace your forks, knives, or chopsticks. Holding a teacup in one hand and a pancake in the other, squatting on the street, they complete what you call the "bread problem"; even this costs three cents. If they sit at a food stall and happily order a bowl of soybean sprouts and eat three bowls of rice, it costs half a yuan. After digestion, excretion costs another two cents. Naturally, this is just individual living. Talking about home leads to housing: it's what you often see in the newspaper, a fire in some corner, burning dozens, hundreds, or thousands of shanties. That's where their homes are. Although they may not consider living there seriously, their income, after deducting food expenses for themselves and their families, still has to cover a bit of rent, which is quite burdensome. There, on barren grassy fields, covered with dilapidated shacks, water, everyone rushes to the Taiping faucet in the morning to get a small lead bucket in turn, insects, silkworms, constantly attacking them 24 hours a day. Those without families live together in a room, where it's difficult to even sit comfortably. Yet, they have lived peacefully in this environment for more than forty years.</p>
<p>You don't need to listen any further; you naturally understand what kind of hygiene this life has. Indeed, it's really not easy to talk about hygiene in this kind of life. However, this kind of life especially needs hygiene; otherwise, they are prone to illness and even more prone to death!</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the Mutual Aid Association's annual hygiene meeting has a profound significance. According to Director Gu, the result of the three-day event held at the Western District Branch of the McGinn Medical Society this year was:</p>
<p>Exhibition: The rooms displayed various physiological and pathological specimens, models, and colorful pictures, all very simple and eye-catching. Performances and films were shown twice a day, explaining in detail typhoid fever, dysentery, meningitis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, smallpox, pneumonia, whooping cough, plague, tuberculosis, malaria, relapsing fever, as well as venereal diseases, self-discharge, parasites, etc. This guided their understanding and aroused their attention, so they all requested vaccinations and smallpox vaccinations, and everyone was busy.</p>
<p>On the last day, the baby contest was the most interesting finale. Their wives, holding three or six children each, enthusiastically participated. Among the 126 clean babies, three were found to be white, chubby, and lively angels that one could hardly believe came from poor families:</p>
<p>(1) Sun Da Wangzi, eight months old, 21 pounds</p>
<p>(2) Pan Liubaozi, eleven months old, 22 pounds</p>
<p>(3) Sun Da Gen, five months old, 17 pounds</p>
<p>Da Wangzi's mother received the prize! A set of flannel shirt and pants, shoes, socks, candy, and medicated soap. A group of people surrounded her, laughing and congratulating her, while also envying her. The rest all received candy. The worst twelve also each received a bottle of cod liver oil and nourishing products. We recall the annual "44" (referring to a disaster) and have never seen such a heartwarming scene!</p>
<p>There are still 38,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession. We see that the number of participants above is less than a quarter, because some still don't understand this matter, and others are too busy making a living to take time off. It is hoped that the association will diligently guide them on one hand and actively promote the welfare of rickshaw pullers on the other, striving for even greater benefits at next year's seventh regular meeting.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder Case at the Bank of Communications in Xiamen - Dong Jiting Arrested - Sweeping Away Huge Sums of Money and Fleeing with a Prostitute, A Reward Was Offered for His Arrest, And He Was Finally Captured</h3>
<p>Dong Jiting, from Changping, Hebei, used to work at the Bank of Communications in Nanjing. Later, due to the fall of Nanjing, he was reassigned to the Bank of Communications in Xiamen. Dong liked to wander and became acquainted with a famous local prostitute, Zhang Yueqin, and suddenly had the idea of stealing public funds and eloping with the prostitute. The key to the bank's vault was always in the hands of the cashier Wang. On February 9th of this year, Dong used deceptive methods to lure Wang to open the vault, and then Dong used a hammer to strike Wang's head from behind, killing him on the spot. Dong then stole 130,000 yuan in cash from the vault and fled to Hong Kong with Zhang Yueqin. Before leaving, he even falsely asked the bank's manager for sick leave. Dong stayed in Hong Kong for more than ten days, then brought Zhang to Shanghai and hid in the French Concession. At that time, the Bank of Communications published Dong's photo in newspapers and offered a huge reward for his arrest. Dong felt it was dangerous to stay in Shanghai, so he took Zhang north to Beijing. The Bank of Communications' wanted ad for Dong was published in newspapers in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. Dong and Zhang arrived in Beijing, first staying in a hotel, and later settling in at No. 31 Zongmao Hutong. Because Zhang Yueqin spent lavishly in Beijing, she attracted attention. After Zhang Yueqin was arrested, she learned that Dong had returned to his native Changping, so the local "police" arrested Dong. Dong has now been taken to the "Beijing Court." Nothing has been heard about how he will be dealt with.</p>
<h3>After Her Husband's Death, Unwilling to Remain Chaste, the Mother-in-Law Sues the Daughter-in-Law to Hand Over Her Person and Property</h3>
<p>Zheng Zhuang, an old woman from Fenghua, is 63 years old this year. She had two sons. The eldest son, Yonghe, now runs the Guomin Western Clothing Company at No. 17 West Xiafei Road. The second son, Renhe, also ran the Hua Yi Clothing Company on the same road before his death. He married Fang and had three children, the eldest named Li'en, the second Huai'en, and the third Xian'en. In 1931, Fang died in Ningbo. Zheng Renhe then remarried his wife's younger sister, Fang, as his second wife. In October 1935, Renhe also died. The children and property left in Shanghai were under the guardianship of Fang, the second wife, who also managed the property on behalf of the children. Recently, Fang, unwilling to remain chaste, gradually became pregnant and sold her husband's Hua Yi Clothing Company to others. Her mother-in-law, Zheng Zhuang, believed that Fang's behavior was detrimental to the property of her grandchildren (i.e., the wards under guardianship), so she retained lawyer Yu Hualong, who filed a lawsuit in the Second Branch of the Civil Court against Fang in her capacity as the original guardian, demanding that she hand over both the person and the property. After Judge Yu reviewed the case, the judgment was issued yesterday. The main points of the judgment were: the defendant should hand over the wards, Zheng Li'en, Huai'en, and Xian'en, to the original guardian, and should also hand over the property due to the wards Li'en, etc., to the original guardian for management. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant.</p>
<h3>The Zhou and Gu Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Zhou Has Never Been Involved in Politics</p>
<p>At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred on McAlister Road, north of the intersection of Brennan Road and Victory Road in western Shanghai. Dr. Zhou Junchang, engineer Gu Pengcheng, and a groom, Gu Zhenhua, were kidnapped and forced into a car, which sped off towards the Chinese area. Their whereabouts are still unknown. It is reported that Zhou Junchang runs the Shen Tai Silk Shop in Nanxun. What was reported yesterday, that he was once a member of the National Economic Commission when Zhang Jingjiang was the chairman, was actually a mistake for his brother, Junmei. As for Junchang, he usually practices medicine in Shanghai and has never been involved in politics.</p>
<h3>The Case of a Maternal Uncle Kidnapping His Nephew - All the Perpetrators Appeal the Third Trial</h3>
<p>From perpetrator Wu Peng, Sent Back to the High Court For Retrial - Appeals by All Other Perpetrators Rejected</p>
<p>The notorious kidnapper Xue Guanpeng, colluding with accomplices Zhou Bin and others, kidnapped his nephew Wu Guorong (12 years old) in front of Hander Primary School at No. 277 Park Road at noon on August 30th of last year, demanding a huge ransom. He was arrested by the Old Gate Police Station. Based on his confession, another accomplice, Wu Peng, was arrested and taken to the First Special Court for interrogation. Xue Guanming and Zhou Bin were sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Wu Peng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. After receiving the judgment, the perpetrators refused to accept it and retained lawyers Zhang Danping and others to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Judge Nie presided over the hearing and ruled that the original judgment against Xue Guanming, Zhou Bin, and Wu Peng be revoked. Xue Guanming was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Zhou Bin was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Wu Peng was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting in kidnapping for ransom. The four ransom letters were confiscated. After receiving the judgment, the perpetrators still refused to accept the judgment and again retained lawyer Zhang Danping to file a third appeal to the Supreme Court. According to the petition, the Criminal Court of the Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the Supreme Court reviewed the case yesterday and ruled that the original judgment regarding Wu Peng was revoked and sent back to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. The appeals of all other perpetrators were rejected.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Owner Falsely Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods - Appeal Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Weng Yongsheng, a Cantonese pawnshop owner of Senchang Pawnshop at No. 286 Tianjin Road, together with Su Shunqing from Suzhou and Zhang Zhiting, a Cantonese pawnshop owner of Shengxing Pawnshop at No. 919 Haining Road, were accused by the bandit He Lianpin in February of this year of receiving three stolen coats and were charged in the First Special District Court. The first instance judgment sentenced He Lianpin to five years of imprisonment for robbery, and Weng Yongsheng and Zhou Guqing each to a fine of 300 yuan, and Zhang Zhiting to a fine of 200 yuan. Weng and others felt that this punishment was unjust and unfair, so they retained lawyer Qian Zheng to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Judge Nie Chongyi once questioned the bandit He Lianpin, and his confession was completely inconsistent with the first instance, full of flaws. Witnesses Cai Wenyao and Yang Ganqing turned themselves in to prove that the coats retrieved by the police were theirs and had not been stolen. They were pawned because they were needed urgently at the time and pointed out in court that there were secret marks on the coats and that they fit perfectly, and that He Lianpin falsely accused them of being stolen goods. After defense lawyer Qian Zheng fully refuted He's false statements, Judge Nie announced the judgment: the original judgment was revoked, and Weng Yongsheng, Zhou Shunqing, and Zhang Zhiting were all declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>Large and Small Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai to Close by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>According to the Social News Agency, gambling dens in western Shanghai were at their peak last year, with no fewer than forty or fifty of all sizes. Afterwards, the larger ones grew larger, so the smaller ones knew they couldn't compete and were gradually eliminated. By this spring, only twenty-four remained, large and small. After the "Japanese Entertainment Department Supervisory Office" was abolished on March 10th, all gambling dens were once ordered to close. However, due to the strong efforts of the gambling den owners, they still existed. Recently, Dasheng Gambling Den and others were again ordered to close, and Lianyi and others followed suit. Thus, the gambling dens in western Shanghai have fallen into decline. It is understood that all gambling dens in western Shanghai will be banned and ordered to close by the end of this month. Therefore, the gambling den owners have been panicking in recent days. However, it is not yet known whether this ban is permanent or a temporary order to close for a few days.</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration increased postage rates from abroad, the amount of postage due has also increased accordingly. The original postage due stamps are no longer sufficient, so three new types of postage due stamps have been added from the Hong Kong Maritime Printing Office, with denominations of 50 cents, 1 yuan, and 2 yuan, colored yellowish-brown. They have now been printed, shipped to Shanghai, and put into use, and are being sold at the philatelic office on the third floor.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Poor People's Clinic" provides free medical care for the poor and sick. The address is No. 79 Race Course Road. It will start sending out doctors today, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. It is reported that there are plans to add a surgical department in the future.</p>
<p>The Gold Bar brand cigarettes produced by the Hua'an Cigarette Company in this port were once very popular. Recently, due to soaring raw material prices, they have had to change the original packaging to a thinner paper. The selling price, free gifts, and cigarette quality will remain the same.</p>
<p>Dr. Li Wei, chief physician of the Weikang Dental Clinic on the second floor of HSBC Bank at No. 872 Beijing Road, Beinicheng Bridge, specializes in the treatment, filling, and extraction of teeth. His surgical skills are superb and his reputation is well-known. He is open as usual on Sunday mornings.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Forces Harass Yangzhong - Officials and Civilians Cooperate to Cope</h3>
<p>According to people from Yangzhong, Yangzhong was once occupied and then quickly recovered. The provincial government sent Pan Bingying as the county magistrate, who made many innovations in administration and education, and actively carried out the work of educating the public, eradicating traitors and eliminating falsehoods without sparing any effort. The villains disappeared and hid, and local order was restored. This spring, the Japanese army launched another large-scale harassment, and the county seat fell. They used local ruffians such as Gu Xianchi to try to establish a puppet organization, but the people had been strictly trained, so Gu and others were thwarted everywhere. Now, County Magistrate Pan is still promoting county administration in the countryside and is consulting with local people on all relief measures.</p>
<h3>Citibank Establishes Fourth Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The US Citibank in this port has built a new building at the corner of Mears Road and Rue Paul Henry, adjacent to the Cathay Mansions building, to establish a French Concession office, which opened on the 13th of this month. The general design of the new building was very thoughtful, because the foundation of the Cathay Mansions building on Rue Paul Henry is the most severely subsided in the city, and the depth of the subsidence has reached one meter, and it is still subsiding about one millimeter per month. Therefore, the foundation of the new building of the bank is separated from the Cathay Mansions building and is entirely made of cement and steel to avoid being dragged down. This project was undertaken by engineer Minidi Kaiwen and was completed in less than four months.</p>
<h3>China &amp; Western Pharmacy Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China &amp; Western Pharmacy on Simar Road in this city held its 8th Annual Shareholders Meeting yesterday at 9:00 AM at the Emerald Theater on the fourth floor of the Sun Sun Department Store. More than 400 shareholder representatives attended, and Jin Zongcheng chaired the meeting. After reporting on the general business situation, the allocation of the 28th-year surplus and the company's capital increase were discussed. It was generally believed that it was necessary to increase capital in order to adapt to business operations. It was decided that all shareholders' official dividends for the 27th and 28th years would be used to subscribe for additional shares. On average, each old share could subscribe for one new share, and the remainder would be subscribed by directors, supervisors, and all employees. The amount of the capital increase was limited to 700,000 yuan, combined with the original capital of 500,000 yuan, for a total of 1,200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong was clear, with strong and sandy winds but no specific direction. The weather here was cloudy and will turn clear, with westerly to southeasterly winds. The East China Sea will have northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 82.9 and the lowest was 60.3. On the same day last year, the highest was 77.0 and the lowest was 61.5.</p>

<h3>How About the Future of Foreign Exchange (3)</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhi</p>
<p>This article mainly speculates on the future of foreign exchange based on the current situation. It uses the article "How About the Future of Legal Tender" in issues 244-5 of this publication, and looks forward to its future based on the legal tender itself, which has continuity; although the latter was written two years ago, the points discussed have never changed and will never change, so it can be consulted.</p>
<p>This article is divided into twelve sections, which will be published in this publication one after another. The outline is hereby presented as follows:</p>
<p>1. Now We Should Laugh Silently (Previous Issue) 2. Treasury Bills and Stabilization Funds (Previous Issue)</p>
<p>3. "Restrictions on Withdrawals" and Frequent Thefts (Previous Issue) 4. "Not Maintaining" Is More Difficult Than Maintaining (Last Issue)</p>
<p>4. Possibility of Sino-US Cooperation on Shanghai Exchange Rate (Last Issue) 6. Trade Deficit and Stabilization Fund (This Issue)</p>
<p>5. Legal Tender Gold Reserves and Overseas Funds (This Issue) 8. The Truth About the Bankruptcy of the Ruble and the Mark (This Issue)</p>
<p>6. "Natural Level" and Artificial Level (This Issue) 10. Foreign Currency Value and Speculative Profits (To Be Continued)</p>
<p>7. Expansion of the European War and the Future of the US Dollar (Last Issue) 12. The Maximum Extent of Japanese and Puppet Sabotage (To Be Continued)</p>
<p>Throughout history, everyone knows that the fluctuations in the black market are due to people's "lack of confidence", so they are easily incited by various rumors and slanders; but why are they lacking confidence? First, they do not understand the reality and have illusions; second, they lack the ability to judge and are easily surrounded by confusing words; third, they cherish their private property but do not know how to maintain it reasonably; fourth, speculators all think that others are doing it, so why not me. Therefore, although historical facts have always shattered rumors, everyone's psychology cannot help but be swayed when rumors arise again. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide various basic facts about the future of the exchange market, so as to help readers enhance their judgment ability, so that everyone is psychologically prepared. It should have been published in order according to the procedures of each section, but because the expansion of the European War and the changes in the future of the US dollar have a particularly deep relationship with the black market in this city, this section will be published earlier in the previous issue, and the rest will still be published in order.</p>
<p>Some parts of this article were mentioned in the speech at the banquet of the Youth Association on Ba Xian Qiao on May 8. Because the signature is different, it may cause misunderstandings, so I make a special note here.</p>
<p>Due to the de facto large trade deficit, many people believe that "it is always pessimistic to use a limited exchange stabilization fund of 10 million pounds to maintain an unlimited huge trade deficit." Many people have discussed its crisis in articles; like a certain gentleman in the Finance &amp; Commerce weekly even pointed out that the step-by-step decline in the black market price this year was caused by the large trade deficit of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs; he even expressed that he felt that the decline in the black market caused by the trade deficit was more dangerous than the decline caused by speculators. We are very grateful for this gentleman's enthusiasm for Chinese foreign exchange; at the same time, we hope that he will withdraw his view based on all the facts related to exchange. The author has always admired this gentleman's insight and foresight, and even more admires him as one of the foreign nationals in China who has the most research on the Chinese economy. The author has read many of his great works, and most admires him for the fact that the key to the balance of China's international balance of payments is not in trade, but in the income and expenditure outside of trade; such as remittances from overseas Chinese, expenses of foreigners (including businessmen, travelers, officials, troops, etc.) in China, and investment income from foreign securities, etc. Relying on this kind of income to offset the trade deficit is indeed a major morbidity in China's international balance of payments, and efforts should be made to increase production to find ways to correct it, but it is too objective to judge the future of the black market exchange rate based on the trade deficit alone, and to ignore the other factors that are beneficial to the black market exchange rate.</p>
<p>Second: The import value on the customs booklet is calculated according to the legal exchange rate, which should be corrected; but we feel that it is not very practical to simply correct the import trade value according to the black market price. From the perspective of international balance of payments: the accurate import expenditure value should be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of settlement; in the period of stable exchange rates, the import values in the two periods of settlement price and receipt of goods are indeed almost the same, but that is not the case today. Although it is impossible to use this method to correct customs figures, the figures corrected by the black market price of the current month cannot be trusted too much. However: the trade deficit in the occupied areas, especially in places like Shanghai, is indeed a fact; the impact of the trade deficit on the black market exchange market is also undeniable. But it is not as big as generally imagined.</p>
<p>Third: The source of drafts in the black market exchange market is not purely the stabilization fund; perhaps most of them are transformed from Shanghai hot money. The foreign exchange sold by HSBC is not all from Hong Kong, and the foreign exchange dumped by Hong Kong is not all from the Sino-British stabilization fund; this is something everyone can imagine. Since the entry and exit of speculators are always replacing the entry and exit of the stabilization fund, then the conclusion that the consumption of the stabilization fund is measured by the amount of the trade deficit is of course absolutely inconsistent with the facts. Moreover, the operation of the stabilization fund is definitely not just out but not in. As long as they are not Japanese businessmen or other scumbags, the stabilization fund can find representatives outside of HSBC to absorb from the market for the preparation for future lending. May I ask if you followed Sassoon, Citibank, etc. in the past, weren't you definitely digging graves for your own speculative purposes?</p>
<p>Because of the increase in the amount of legal tender issued, because local currency is being implemented again in some areas, because of the long-term trade deficit, because the black market price of foreign exchange always shrinks quickly and loosens slowly, because of the continuous need for materials for the war of resistance, etc., people almost regard the government's income and expenditure as the family income and expenditure of a couple, thinking that they will inevitably "eat up everything" and inevitably "issue blank checks" and implement inflation. Looking at legal tender and foreign exchange with this pessimistic glasses, the more you look, the more pessimistic you become.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that with the development of the interior and the replenishment of those broken and burned legal tender, the increase in the issuance of legal tender is inevitable. And everyone knows that today's interest rates in various places are higher than usual; in Shanghai, in addition to the high interbank lending rates, there are also high exchange discount rates; these are exactly the phenomena of tight money supply rather than inflation. But when it comes to the fact that the amount of legal tender issued has exceeded 3 billion yuan, everyone feels that it is too much. However, if it is divided equally among 450 million people, each person will not even get 6.7 yuan. Compared with foreign countries, it is simply a small witch compared to a big one.</p>
<p>Currency Issuance and Population of Various Countries</p>
<p>Currency Issuance Number of People Average Per Capita</p>
<p>Japan 3,818 69 55.2</p>
<p>United States 4,956 123 40.4</p>
<p>United Kingdom 555 45 12.3</p>
<p>France 151,322 42 3,603</p>
<p>Germany 11,798 80 147.5</p>
<p>China 3,082 450 6.7</p>
<p>(Note) The unit of currency issuance is 1 million of the local currency of each country; the unit of population is 1 million people; the average per capita is 1 school of the local currency of each country.</p>
<p>As for the issuance of local currency, the number is not large, and they are all prepared with legal tender as issuance. Therefore, it is obvious that a part of the amount of legal tender issued is not in circulation. Not only that; this kind of non-circulating legal tender is not only the issuance preparation for local currency, but also the payment preparation for financial institutions in various places, which must be even greater. According to general estimates: 3 billion yuan of legal tender is concentrated in Shanghai, about 400 million yuan is left in North China, and 400 million yuan has flowed to foreign countries such as Hong Kong and Annam. Therefore, in the vast and accumulated country, there are actually only 1.2 billion yuan of legal tender in circulation. Therefore, even if local currency is added, it has to be said that it is still "more monks than gruel".</p>
<p>It is true that what everyone fears is "inflation", perhaps it is not the increase in the issuance of legal tender, but the concern that the reserve fund for the issuance of legal tender is not enough. To estimate the value of currency with reserve funds, in modern currency thinking, it can only be said that he is "reading old books with old glasses."</p>
<p>Strictly speaking: legal tender is a kind of managed currency. On the day when its legal basis continues to exist, even if there is no reserve fund at all, its value will not be reduced in the slightest. This is not the arbitrariness of the law, because the law has the country as its backing. And the country has a large number of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and the national spirit of eagerly demanding freedom and survival as its backing. Manpower, material resources, and financial resources constitute the material basis for the true value of legal tender; the great national spirit guarantees that these manpower, material resources, and financial resources do belong to legal tender. Everyone firmly believes that on the day when the final victory comes, the black market price will definitely loosen greatly immediately. At this time of great relaxation, the reserve fund will certainly not increase greatly immediately. Then the true value of legal tender is not in the amount of gold reserves; and it is conceivable that today's black market price cannot represent the true value of legal tender.</p>
<p>Theoretically, whether or not legal tender has gold reserves is not a problem; in fact, the gold reserves of legal tender still maintain as much as 48.9% to 58.0%. This is much larger than the UK's gold reserve rate of 38.2% in August last year and Germany's 0.7% in January this year. It can be compared with France's 59.4% in November last year.</p>
<p>If you suspect that the government's figures may be too high, then use Japan's intentionally underestimated figures to illustrate. The Japanese do everything they can to slander legal tender; but they still have to admit that legal tender does have huge gold reserves. Looking at their change from "destroying legal tender" to today's "using legal tender", it can be seen that they have to admit the fact that legal tender is strong and deeply rooted. Looking at their publishing industry, articles that "study" Chinese legal tender are often seen, but none of them dare to arbitrarily assert that the reserves of legal tender have been emptied. For example, the Oriental Magazine published in April of this year contains an article by Isamu Imura; this author is an expert in slandering legal tender. He began by fabricating that "the right to issue legal tender has been jointly managed by the United Kingdom and the United States". With this attitude of his, it can be imagined that he must have underestimated the reserve fund of legal tender very arbitrarily. However, what is the result of his arbitrary underestimation?</p>
<p>(1) 300,000,000 Hong Kong dollars of the Chinese government's deposit in HSBC in Hong Kong at the end of last year as a reserve fund for legal tender</p>
<p>(2) 550,000,000 yuan of private deposits in the same period, with the private property of important Chinese government officials being the largest</p>
<p>(3) 763,950,000 ounces of the total amount of silver deposited in China in the same period (calculated at 0.77 ounces per yuan)</p>
<p>(4) 171,000,000 ounces of silver deposited in the US Federal Reserve Bank as a legal tender foreign exchange stabilization fund</p>
<p>There are more than these four types that can be used as legal tender funds. The issuance preparation of legal tender is actually not within these four types, but has its own independent accounting. Imura's confusion of facts is originally necessary for his motive of slandering legal tender. Even if these four types are added together, it reaches 1.7 billion yuan, which is about 60% of the amount of legal tender issued at the same time, which is even higher than the official report. Assuming that half of them are private properties that the government cannot control, then the controllable still accounts for about 30% of the amount issued. Although Imura listed the above two or three types as private properties, and believed that the issuance preparation of legal tender was only 522 million yuan. But it is much better than Japan. Because at the end of last year, Japan's exchange fund was reduced to 300 million yen according to his official report. Adding his official number of 200 million yen for new gold mining each year, and about 200 million yen looted in China each year, then his exchange fund that can be used last year is 700 million yen in total; but his trade deficit with third countries last year reached 460 million yen. It can be seen that his remaining exchange fund at the end of last year was at most 294 million yen. It is less than 10% of his currency issuance of 3.82 billion yen at that time. Moreover, his official numbers are even more questionable.</p>
<p>The Truth About the Bankruptcy of the Mark and the Ruble</p>
<p>On that day in the storm and rain on May 2, because the Ministry of Finance remained silent, rumors in the market were confused, the degree of violent shrinkage was fierce, and the purchase of goods was universal, etc., people who did not know the situation clearly were almost psychologically as panicked as the era of the bankruptcy of the Mark and the Ruble at the beginning and end of the last European War. Even in peacetime, people often ask ridiculous questions such as "Will legal tender become the Mark or the Ruble" because of the daily shrinkage of the black market exchange rate, the annual increase in the number of legal tender issued, and the ever-increasing war.</p>
<p>This panic, this question, is really caused by not understanding historical facts, but only remembering historical phenomena. Everyone knows that the bankruptcy of the Mark and the Ruble at the beginning and end of the European War were both intentionally caused by the German government and the Soviet Russian government. Otherwise, it would never have been such a mess.</p>
<p>The German government had no way to resist the Allied powers by force, and the Allied powers demanded more than 3 million marks in reparations, which could not be borne by the German government and the public. Because accepting this demand would also bankrupt the German economy; so they used the means of burning their boats to destroy the Mark and destroy the Allied powers' extravagant hope of demanding huge reparations from Germany. As a result, the issuance of the Mark expanded unreasonably, continuously and infinitely, and finally the value of the Mark fell to hundreds of millions of times below zero.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Russian government's promotion of the bankruptcy of the Ruble. It was even more due to their strategic policy. Although the Red Army had disarmed the bourgeoisie, the value of the Ruble still guaranteed the power of the bourgeoisie in society. Especially since the power of confiscation cannot reach the hidden part, in order to completely eliminate the hidden part, the Soviet Russian government decided to adopt the means of sacrificing the Ruble. From 1918, the amount of Ruble issued completed its means of destruction under the planned expansion of the Soviet Russian government. It is shown in the following table.</p>
<p>Ruble Currency Issuance in Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1924</p>
<p>January 1, 1918 27.3000</p>
<p>January 1, 1919 63.800</p>
<p>January 1, 1920 225.000</p>
<p>January 1, 1921 1.100.000</p>
<p>January 1, 1922 17.500.000</p>
<p>January 1, 1923 2.600.000.000</p>
<p>January 1, 1924 178.500.000.000</p>
<p>March 1, 1925 865.500.000.000</p>
<p>(Note) According to Ynugoff Economic Trends in Sovlet Russia, in millions of Rubles.</p>
<p>With this planned destruction, the value of the Ruble naturally fell sharply uncontrollably. During the October Revolution, one Ruble was nominally worth 52 cents in US dollars; in 1923, every US dollar was nominally worth 5 million Rubles. The Soviet Russian government issued gold Ruble notes on February 8, 1924. These gold Ruble notes also did not have any preparation, only a legal price. According to this legal price, every 50,000 Rubles issued in 1923 could be exchanged for one gold Ruble; and the Rubles issued in 1923 were equal to 1 million old Rubles issued before 1923. From this, it can be seen that when the Soviet Russian government recovered the old Rubles in 1924, the value of the old Rubles had fallen below 50 million times (according to Lawton, An Economic History of Soviet Russia). However, this phenomenon of being worthless does not truly reflect his external exchange rate. The exchange rate for US dollars is even more expensive than the parity price. It was not until the old Rubles began to be recovered at the official price set on March 10, 1924 that it fell a little, but it was still above the parity price, and it has remained unchanged ever since. Although the exchange rate for British pounds once shrunk below the parity price, it immediately rebounded. It is shown in the following table</p>
<p>Ruble Exchange Rate from 1924 to 1925</p>
<p>Date Exchange Rate for British Pounds Exchange Rate for US Dollars</p>
<p>Parity Price 9.458 Rubles per Pound 1.94 Rubles per US Dollar</p>
<p>January 1, 1924 9.40 2.20</p>
<p>April 1, 1924 8.36 1.945</p>
<p>July 1, 1924 8. 1 1.945</p>
<p>October 1, 1924 8.67 1.945</p>
<p>January 1, 1925 9.17 1.945</p>
<p>April 1, 1925 9.25 1.945</p>
<p>July 1, 1925 9.435 1.945</p>
<p>(Note) According to Narodny bank Monthly Review Nay.1931. The unit is Ruble.</p>
<p>The domestic value of the Ruble has fallen sharply, but the international value has not changed much; and once it is rectified, its domestic value will immediately rebound and quickly return to normal. If the prices of 1913 are used as 100 points, then his wholesale price on October 1, 1924 was only 164.3 points; the retail price was only 203 points. In other words; the former is only 64.3% more expensive than before the war, and the latter is only 103% more expensive than before the war. This is probably unexpected for people who only know historical phenomena but do not understand historical facts!</p>
<p>This is certainly not a miracle, nor a natural phenomenon, but the result of human intervention by the Soviet Russian government. In other words: this is also the development of the spiritual power of the Soviet Russian people. All classical monetary theories, all gold-worshiping monetary theories, they simply do not understand the determining relationship of today's international exchange rates. Therefore, although the nominal value of the Ruble fell sharply with the evil expansion of issuance, their actual international balance of payments still adhered to the legal parity price. Therefore, the "purchasing power parity theory" was produced in the international exchange study after the war, believing that the main factor determining international exchange rates lies in the balance of international trade, not in whether the currency material and the currency value are balanced? Then there is no reason for the current decline in the black market price of foreign exchange in our country, where wartime trade is improving.</p>
<p>"Natural Level" and "Artificial Level"</p>
<p>Perhaps there are now many people studying: "Is the current 3.5 pence for the British pound and 4.6875 yuan for the US dollar the new natural level"? Some may even be studying: "How long will this level be stable"?</p>
<p>According to their speculative experience, speculators imagine that the so-called "natural level" must be an exchange rate that is lower than before. Therefore, every time the black market exchange rate experiences a trend, a new so-called "natural level" is produced; and each new "natural level" always shrinks the black market price by 10% to 20%. I think this is an insult to the "natural level". The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance hopes that the black market exchange rate will produce a "natural level" in free fluctuations. If he also regards the lower exchange rate as the "natural level", it is really an incomparable mistake!</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned key to determining international exchange rates, the main factor determining international exchange rates is not whether the currency material and the currency value are balanced, but whether the commodity trade is balanced. And if you want to study the trend of commodity trade balance, you should measure the trend of wartime trade according to the statutory exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. If you calculate according to the black market price, the result you get is only a currency phenomenon, only a price phenomenon, not the truth of commodity trade. Only from the truth of commodity trade can we discover how the main factors determining the exchange rate are changing, so we can judge whether the current black market exchange rate is reasonable? Whether it conforms to the meaning of the so-called "natural level"?</p>
<p>If this theory is correct, then the trend of our country's wartime trade balance is not worse than before the war, but even has great progress compared with before the war. This progress is definitely not a blind blow, because the new construction during the war is enough to offset part of the destruction under the artillery fire, and high prices naturally save part of the consumption. If the situation in the inland is not enough to represent the situation in the whole country, then we might as well take a step back and take Shanghai's foreign trade in the occupied areas as an example. Shanghai's trade has always accounted for more than half of the total trade in the country. Then the actual performance of Shanghai's trade balance should have a powerful impact on the trend of international exchange rates. (This section is also not finished)</p>

<h3>Coal Market with Big Rise and Small Fall</h3>
<p>The local climate is hot, and since the war, the communist coal mines have been located in the occupied areas, and transportation has been blocked. They have had to reduce their supply and give priority to imported foreign coal for supply. Therefore, the rise and fall of the market depends on the contraction of the exchange market. The orders change in the morning and evening, and the rise and fall are unpredictable. When the shilling shrank sharply on the second of this month, the coal market even closed for a day that day, and overnight orders were implicitly cancelled (so there were countless disputes caused by repentance on that day). The next day, various goods such as smoke and white coal were all demolished in the collective market, and each ton rose by 50 to 60 yuan (equivalent to 30% to 40% of the board). Considering the situation, the daily inventory in this city is no less than 100,000 tons, all of which are low-cost. The price should not rise as soon as it gets wind, but the owners insist that the cost is important and the supply of goods will be cut off in the future. They insist on their own way and implement the means of taking advantage of the fire to rob and take the opportunity to raise prices.</p>
<p>Until recently, the finance has gradually become stable, and the foreign exchange has gradually loosened. The US dollar has risen from 4.125 yuan to 5.53125 yuan. Various foreign goods have invisibly reduced the cost of goods by 30%, and will return to the original state of the previous month. It should rise if it has risen, and it should be reduced if it should be reduced. Moreover, according to the current exchange rate calculation, at a minimum, it must also be reduced by two-thirds of the previous rise to be reasonable. However, the owners do not plan to do this. When they hear that the shilling is shrinking, they change the orders in the morning and evening, fearing that the price increase will not be fast. Recently, the foreign exchange has gradually loosened, and the cost has been reduced, but they turn a deaf ear to it, intending to wait and see, and stick to the original board without cutting the code. Therefore, is it "limited by cost"? Or "is there a risk of supply interruption"? According to this week, the foreign coal from Kolkata, India, Indochina, and French Annam. Each cargo of Hongji. Smoke and white coal is no less than 30,000 tons, and the supply is normal, and the shipping is unimpeded. × Coal is not even included. The so-called "source cutoff" is only said that among them, one or two coal merchants are slightly sensible and automatically reduce the board, but it is also a big rise and a small fall, which is not thorough (that is, taking Hongji white coal as an example, the price rose from 170 yuan to 230 yuan last week, an increase of 60 yuan per ton, about 60%. Although 14 yuan of the board has been created recently, it is still less than one-fourth. Other coals such as Indian smoke coal are still planning to maintain a high board of 300 yuan, but the market is weak, and people are looking down. The secret board is reduced by 20 yuan, but there is still no receiver. The coal market situation is already visible). After all, the end of the strong crossbow is difficult to continue, so it is hoped that the coal industry can make plans as soon as possible, reduce it automatically, and do not delay and miss the opportunity, resulting in "losing the wife and losing the army".</p>
<p>As for the coal ball industry, because it is a common fuel for civilians, it is even more attention-grabbing. In one ten-day period, it has fallen by four boards in a row, reducing the board by 24 yuan. The retail price of each dan in the door and village has also been reduced by 1.2 yuan. With increases and decreases, it is also a legitimate procedure for merchants. (Pei)</p>
<h3>Weak Market for Foreign Coal ——People Look Down——</h3>
<p>Although the shilling for various foreign coal goods has been loosening recently, one or two traders hold on to their prejudices, hoping to profit from it, and still stick to the original board for the discount, unwilling to cut the code. Indian smoke coal is still making a top board of 300 yuan, but the market is weak, and people are looking down. The secret board is reduced by more than 20 yuan, urgently seeking to be released, but there is still no receiver. Other coals such as Borneo coal have fallen to 270 yuan, and there are no major transactions. The real reason is that street customers intend to wait and see, measure their income and expenditure, and are unwilling to enter more, and the traders intend to hold on, which further promotes the sluggishness of the stomach.</p>
<h3>Red Sugar Falls the Most</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend downward. The association drew the board. The spot price of No. 24 coarse sand white at the outer warehouse was 71.5 yuan, a small 7 cents. The new goods of Taikoo Chebai B mark were 84.5 yuan, a small 5 cents. The old goods of Cambodian warehouse were 83 yuan. The H mark red sugar was 61.6 yuan to 60.5 yuan, a small 2.5 yuan. The Dutch red sugar was 65 yuan to 64.5 yuan, a small 1.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Futures and Spot Rise</h3>
<p>Mumbai Electric on the 18th, the spot price of silver in the Indian silver market rose by 4 annas, and the futures price rose by 3 annas. The market was stable and firm, and a total of 100 orders were transacted. The British and American silver markets were closed for holidays and there was no telegram.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales of Lead and Tin</h3>
<p>Pig Lead: Sales have always been most extensive through tea merchant guilds. Additionally, local paint companies, litharge factories, type foundries, tin foil factories, printing houses, newspapers, etc., also constitute significant outlets. However, recently, transactions through tea merchant guilds have become increasingly rare, and local consumption has also stagnated. Although actual sales in the market are clear, prices are exceptionally firm due to cost factors. Currently, the market price is estimated at around 135 yuan per picul. It is noted that only about a hundred piculs were traded on the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Tin: Yesterday, only shipyards, machine factories, and other entities scavenged for over ten piculs in the market. Merchants from Shaoxing also purchased about thirty to forty piculs. Actual transactions were not particularly enthusiastic, so the market sentiment remains sluggish. However, market sentiment remains firm as sources are scarce and inventories in Shanghai are not abundant. Small refined tin is quoted at 1,200 yuan, and Dutch tin at 1,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Wuxi Rice and Flour Market is Dim</h3>
<p>Rice Market: Market fluctuations have been erratic in recent days, making it difficult even for experienced professionals to predict market changes. Due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates in Shanghai, general hoarding households in Wuxi have been actively selling samples, but buyers are scarce, leading to price reductions to expedite sales. Rice prices have fallen by more than two yuan, paddy rice by six or seven jiao, and high-quality powdered indica rice is at 31.5 yuan per stone. High-quality indica paddy is at 14.7 or 14.8 yuan per dan. On the 17th, market prices tightened, buyers became more active, and prices rebounded by half a yuan. High-quality powdered white indica rice is at 32 yuan per stone, medium-quality powdered white rice at 31.6 yuan, high-quality brown indica rice at 30 yuan, high-quality indica paddy at 15.2 yuan per dan, and standard paddy at 14.2 or 14.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Sales have been sluggish due to the significant easing of foreign exchange rates in Shanghai. Current market prices for flour are at 12.7 yuan per bag. With the imminent arrival of new wheat, flour prices are expected to decline. (Liang)</p>

<h3>Old Newspaper Re-copied: Sixty-seven Years Ago (389) (See the Tongzhi 12th Year Edition of the Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Martyr</p>
<p>There is a woman named Ning in a farming family in Baitangkou, near Tianjin, betrothed to a son of the Zhang family in Shuangjing. According to the system that an unmarried woman cannot be considered Zhang's wife, it can be said that she is a Zhang's wife. This spring, Zhang died. When the woman heard the bad news, she almost wanted to die. She asked her mother in front of her to go through the door to observe chastity, but her mother loved her daughter very much and did not allow it. Later, the woman asked more vigorously, and the aunts and sisters persuaded her, but the woman's words became more severe and her determination became stronger. The Zhang family was poor, and some people mediated for her, allowing the woman to go through the door to mourn, and then return to her mother's knees, so that she could see Zhang's desolation and cool her initial heart. The woman followed her ceremony, with a bundle of fresh grass, and her appearance was like jade, and she actually went to mourn, and the sadness of her tears almost moved passers-by. Although she wore plain white clothes when she left, after she arrived, she suddenly rushed to the filial piety curtain, changed into the clothes of a widow, and was willing to observe chastity to the end. Zhang's mother politely refused, saying why she was so bitter to herself. The woman begged to stay on the ground, and Ning's mother knew that her daughter would not turn back, so she let her go back to Zhang's, so that she could fulfill her wish. However, Zhang was eventually burdened by poverty, and one more mouth to feed was a waste of hesitation. She didn't want a widow in her family, which would increase the daily supply. The woman slightly peeked at her privacy, saying that her aunt wanted a daughter-in-law, why not follow her husband, vowed to cut off food and die for her husband. Her mother urged her to eat more, but the woman ignored her. There was a Fanjun in the township who heard about it, and accompanied the gentry to persuade her to advance. She only took a sip of water and died after a few counts. Shuangjing is only five miles away from Baitangkou, and relatives from both families came to mourn, all praising the woman's chastity. Those who have not yet warmed their bones and separated their quilts, what should they do!</p>

<h3>Mr. Chen Xuyuan's Impression on Me</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>——Written for Today’s Ningbo Hometown Association Memorial Service——</p>
<p>Mr. Xuyuan has passed away. I don't want to make any systematic account of his life's words, deeds, and career here, or to exaggerate it. I just want to briefly gather some of the impressions he has given me for more than 20 years, in order to express my admiration for him:</p>
<p>(1) Fighting Spirit: Mr. Xuyuan was engaged in business in his early years as a young master, such as printing houses and bookstores, but all ended in failure. But he was not discouraged. Although his alias "Tianxu Wo Sheng" seems to have some meaning of "indignation" because he was not used by the world, he only used it to encourage himself, and did not become passive because of this. Later, he used the path of "writing" as a transition, and finally indirectly achieved his grand wish of "aspiring to industry." With bare hands, he established a small fortress for the motherland to recover its rights - the Family Industry Society.</p>
<p>(2) Tireless Learning: He is a person who has a deep research on Chinese studies, and can be said to be a complete layman in Western science. But he is tireless and not afraid of "learning boxing at the age of eighty." He is willing to study and explore all the sciences and principles related to industrial manufacturing - not limited to cosmetics - until he can understand and apply them. Once, I saw an Yi Jing spread out on his desk, and he was diligently annotating it in the midst of his busy schedule.</p>
<p>(3) Answer Every Question: His love of learning and knowledge seems not only to satisfy his personal desire for knowledge, nor is it to use learning as a stepping stone to achieve his personal goal of "getting rich." He has an attitude of "already achieved people, reaching others" as Confucius said. His learning is "for others," "for society," and "for the country." Therefore, no matter whether he is familiar or unfamiliar, as long as he sincerely asks him for advice, he always "knows everything and says everything." I think his articles on "teaching people tirelessly" and "inducing people step by step," published in the Shen Bao "Food, Clothing, Housing and Transportation Weekly" and other magazines, have long been appreciated by everyone, and I don't want to say more here.</p>
<p>I believe that the three points mentioned above have a "worth considering" value for the general youth. Because the three points are the basic conditions for being a "person". Otherwise, no matter how high a person's social status or how great his reputation is during his lifetime, if he is only for himself or his family, then he is just a "walking corpse," and I am unwilling to waste meaningless ink.</p>
<h3>Discussing Socks</h3>
<p>— Shen Fu</p>
<p>Every time I see the phrase "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," I always see a "discuss" character. Either "discussing shoes," or "discussing cloth," even discussing "buttons." Therefore, I might as well discuss "socks"!</p>
<p>Socks are an indispensable clothing accessory in daily life. Nowadays, most people like to wear silk stockings. Just think, what are the benefits of wearing silk stockings? They are neither economical nor durable, merely wasting money and gaining a bit of beauty. Recently, prices have soared, and silk stockings cannot be bought for one or two yuan. I think it is better to wear cotton socks. They are not only durable but also simple. Isn't that also practicing the new lifestyle? But machine-knitted cotton socks also cost seven or eight jiao a pair, how can we not cherish wearing them! Therefore, we must take good care of them. It is best to change and wash them every day, or change and wash them every other day, because frequent washing and changing can keep the feet clean and prevent the occurrence of dampness-related diseases. It can also prevent the socks from being corroded by foot sweat. If there is a small hole, it should be mended that night, otherwise, "a small hole not mended will lead to great suffering," to the point where they can no longer be worn, which would be a pity. Now, as spring and summer are transitioning and the weather is gradually getting hotter, many people (especially women) are going bare-legged without wearing socks. This method is not only in line with the trend of the times but can also save on sock expenses, truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>A Penetrating Insight</h3>

<p>No one values you for wearing luxurious clothes except for fools. (Lord Avebury)</p>
<p>Those who love delicacies may soon become beggars. (Benjamin Franklin)</p>
<p>Excessive drinking is merely voluntary madness. (Seneca)</p>
<p>Health is the greatest of all possessions; a pale-faced cobbler is better than a sick king. (Begsdeth)</p>
<p>He who feasts every day, feasts no day. (Simms)</p>
<p>The drunkard is fit for any wickedness. (Quarles)</p>
<p>He that destroys his constitution by irregular living, is manifestly a felo de se. (Sherlock)</p>
<h3>Yuanbao Basket</h3>
<p>— Wang Yongtao</p>
<p>The term "Yuanbao Basket," I'm sure few of you know it. Now let me explain it! It is an ancient transportation tool in Ningbo; woven from bamboo strips, its form is like a cradle. There are two bamboo poles on both sides, which are for the porters to carry.</p>
<p>There is no top on the basket. Passengers need to hold their own parasols to shield themselves from the sun. There are cotton cushions in the basket, so passengers sit inside very comfortably.</p>
<p>Every scenic spot in Ningbo has these facilities. Before the war, the Jade Emperor Temple, Tiantong Temple, and Fenghua's Xueshi Temple, the bus stations, were lined up one after another. As soon as the bus arrived, they would come up to solicit business. Although it is not as lively as before the war, the business is still doing quite well!</p>
<p>Yuanbao baskets also have other uses, because in remote rural areas, once someone is ill, if they want to seek medical treatment, there is no car to hire, nor a rickshaw to ride. Although a sedan chair can be used, it is not suitable for patients to ride in. Therefore, the only alternative is the Yuanbao basket. Because people can lie down inside!</p>
<h3>Avoiding Fire Disasters</h3>
<p>— Shaonong</p>
<p>According to the Fire Brigade's report, there were 1,100 fires in Shanghai last year, which shows how serious the problem of fire is in Shanghai today. This article is an original work by Howard Copeland Hill in "Social Life and Public Issues." Hill is the head of the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago in the United States. The fire prevention methods he described, although for the United States, are essentially the same for any country. Now, I will translate it as follows:</p>
<p>When the US government decided to build sixteen new cities in 1918 to house the new National Guard, fire insurance companies immediately felt that this plan was very dangerous. In order to defeat the enemy, they volunteered to serve in the camps to reduce the chance of fire. Therefore, hundreds of yards of open space were left between each building, and large water supply devices were built. Each building was equipped with fire buckets and other fire extinguishing equipment. Firefighters were meticulously trained. Wires and heaters were constructed according to scientific methods. As a result, no fire losses were suffered in each camp.</p>
<p>If ordinary people were also so attentive, the loss from fires would be greatly reduced. The punishment of the negligent by law is indeed effective. In European countries, if his property is destroyed by fire due to negligence, then he is regarded as a criminal. If his negligence causes damage to his neighbors, then he must do his best to pay for the loss, and sometimes he must be imprisoned. Therefore, the number of negligent incidents has indeed decreased a lot. Of course, the law is very effective for society.</p>
<p>Using matches, fireworks, kerosene, and volatile oil carefully, and removing debris and various flammable materials can also help reduce a large part of the loss. If a fire breaks out, the most important thing is not to panic, but to adhere to a few small points; such as closing windows tightly to prevent flames from entering, staying close to the floor to avoid smoke, and covering your head with a damp cloth when passing through a smoke-filled room.</p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association also prints fire prevention regulations: 1. There must be coverings over exposed fires (such as wall stoves, etc.). 2. Do not put dry clothes too close to the stove. 3. Bundle up old newspapers and sell them at any time. 4. Never put burning ashes into wooden containers. 5. Put oily substances into metal cans. 6. Do not accumulate loose debris.</p>
<h3>Utilizing Summer Time for Exercise</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Recently, foreigners in Shanghai are promoting a movement to save daylight time in summer. The so-called "utilizing" and "saving" daylight time in summer is because the days are long in summer, dawn breaks very early, and the afternoons are long and tiring. Therefore, it is advocated to increase office hours by one hour in the morning and reduce them by one hour in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This principle has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Many companies and foreign firms throughout Shanghai will implement it from June 1 to the end of September. In this way, you can get up early in the first half of the day, and have enough rest time in the second half of the day to recover from work fatigue and improve health. This plan has been tried in the United States for many years and has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Perhaps smaller retail stores believe that their business will be hit after this plan is implemented. But according to the results of experiments in England, this is completely incorrect; on the contrary, due to the promotion of the summer time exercise movement, some retail stores have even better business. Because it allows office workers to have more time to browse the windows, instead of rushing home for dinner. However, on the other hand, we must know that reducing office hours by one hour in the afternoon is intended to allow you to find appropriate rest, such as going to the park; visiting the library, etc. If you go to dance halls and singing halls, it will violate the original intention of promoting the use of summer daylight time.</p>
<h3>"Travel" Safety (Continued)</h3>
<p>According to another sailor who took this ship to the Netherlands, when the "Bei" ship was bombed, the author happened to be taking a bath and took off his shirt. He escaped in a hurry upon hearing the alarm, and did not have time to retrieve the money he was carrying with him. At the same time, small valuables such as watches and fountain pens were looted in an instant. And the safe on the ship had also been pried open by someone, and valuables were easily taken. At this critical moment, someone took the opportunity to loot, and among these looters, it was completely unexpected that this ship, although bombed, did not sink after all.</p>
<p>It has been found that this ship was bombed on the ocean, but was spared the sacrifice of most lives, which is several times safer than traveling in China, in addition to the crew's calm cultivation, but also relies on the following equipment. (1) Motorized lifeboats that are easy to resist wind and waves. The number is large and all are ready, and inside are stored emergency rations and other items. (2) Each ship is equipped with two heavy life-saving floats that can hold up to sixteen people to avoid drowning. The edge of the disc is raised, shaped like a rubber wheel, but made of canvas, and filled with Kapok, obtained from the fruit shells of the Java silk-cotton tree. The Kapok is rough in color, and Westerners use it to fill pillows. It is very light and not easily damp, which is conducive to floating. (3) Non-tilting floating apparatus. Each ship has one, which is made by nailing countless empty oil barrels that are easy to float around the top and bottom of the wooden board, and connecting the board edges outside the oil barrels with strong ropes, so that those who fall into the water can drag the ropes and climb the board surface surrounding the oil barrels. (4) Life jackets that are half the number of people on the whole ship plus half. (Also called life vests.) (5) Wireless telegraph alarm equipment. (6) Anti-aircraft masks. As the saying goes, raising soldiers for a thousand days is for use in one day. It is impossible to sail a ship without tools to prevent danger, just as it is impossible to establish a country in the world without national defense, and it is impossible to ensure the safety of a city without police. In an autumn of numerous difficulties, it is different from a peaceful day. Chinese sailors cross thousands of miles of ocean and penetrate minefields, bravely and calmly, becoming the "glory of maritime service." How can the degree of safety be better than the "thousand-gold sons" in China? The gains and losses in this are not entirely related to the depth of knowledge of the shipping authorities. All new things in China learn from the West, and it is absolutely not allowed to miss one or two, so that those who mislead others turn to mislead themselves. From ancient times to the present, whoever seeks greater convenience must consider the disadvantages in the benefits, and plan for preventing the disadvantages. Therefore, the above-mentioned various "weapons" for ensuring the safety of the public in China will surely follow all new facilities and prosper together, and will surely become a kind of industry with good prospects in the future world. The enlightened people in the world should not urgently plan for it. (End)</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Hua Ying Ms.</p>
<p>Pomfret has been on the market for a month, and the price has gradually decreased in the past few days: the large ones are about eight cents per tael, which is comparable to pork. Although pomfret is said to be aristocratic, it is now the same price as pork. Since meat already has its place in my economic menu, then pomfret can certainly participate as well. I don't like pomfret very much, but the master of my house loves to eat it very much. With pomfret, he can eat half a bowl more rice, so I always have to spend forty cents a day to buy five taels, divide it into two pieces, and put them in two bowls for steaming, adding some diced lard. Fortunately, the children are gentle with their chopsticks, and everyone has tasted the new ones. The beauty of pomfret lies entirely in the scales, so other fish must have their scales removed, but only pomfret cannot have its scales removed. There are two ways to cook it: steaming and braising, but if you want to eat it fresh and tender, steaming is better.</p>

<h3>Where are you going (2)</h3>
<p>"Where are you going?" The main point of this question is not referring to the fact that you have finished your life's work, the sun is about to set, and where you are going. This question of future destiny is indeed important, but if we currently encourage ourselves to be good people, this future question will naturally be solved accordingly. Therefore, this question essentially means, where are you going now? What habits do you have? What ideals and attitudes do you hold towards God and people? What ideals and attitudes do you hold towards yourself? If, from now on, you follow the current direction, where will you reach in ten or thirty years? In general, not many people change their behavior after graduating from university. A certain gentleman said it well, "What we are now, we will be in the future." Our habits and attitudes have all been formed. Now, please tell me, where is the path to life leading you? Are you acting according to ideals, or according to impulses? Are you following the path of greed, or the path of generosity? Are you using others, or sharing their joys and sorrows? Are you drifting with the wind, or climbing upwards? Are you a Christian, or a non-Christian? The way we live now will inevitably determine our future achievements. The scripture says, "What a man sows, that shall he also reap." Therefore, the key is not where you come from, but where you are going now. Many people who study psychology but lack a foundation in philosophy say that life is a machine. However, we believe otherwise. We maintain that people are responsible for their own actions. Those who intentionally break the law and kill are often punished according to the law. Naturally, we cannot underestimate the influence of the environment, but when the situation is set, the power to change the path of life rests with ourselves. We can make choices regarding various different lifestyles and methods of behavior. John Prickard of America once said a famous saying a hundred years ago, he said, "Whoever allows themselves to be hijacked by the world is equal to allowing themselves to be directed by the world." Many people's behaviors are like this. Conversely, those who refuse to do what the world does cannot be controlled by the world. The president of Harvard University once said, "The most important point in educating young people to be good citizens today is to teach them how to resist meaningless propaganda." If young people know where they are going and are determined to achieve that noble goal, then they must pick up their walking stick to oppose the push of the masses, or cunning propaganda, and cultivate the strength to go their own way.

<h3>Future Relief Work</h3>
<p>— Qian Che</p>
<p>The refugees in Shanghai's various shelters will be scattered before the end of this month. The future of these compatriots, old fathers, sisters, brothers and children whose fields are barren and families are broken, is something I dare not speculate about. The gentlemen of the Refugee Association have exhausted their minds and exerted their strength, running around and calling for help for them for so long, but finally, due to insufficient funding, they have come up with this last resort. Their heartfelt pain must be even greater than ours.</p>
<p>The creation of this tragic fact is, of course, due to the gradual decrease in donations. The so-called compassion that everyone has is now long gone with the sound of cannons, and it has intensified. Grasping economic authority, speculating and manipulating, this one advocates and that one echoes, creating an unprecedented tragedy on the "isolated island." The lives of ordinary citizens are precarious, who else will care about the lives of refugees! Fortunately, the relief gentlemen have used both soft and hard tactics, not only using entertainment to raise funds widely, but also collecting refugee donations to supplement it. It is already very difficult for the relief funds to be maintained until today.</p>
<p>However, in fact, relief work also has its shortcomings. For example, the "expanding refugee production movement" that was shouted for a while, although there were several exhibition of products, the result had to be considered a failure. Even more unfortunately, many refugees, because they sit and eat comfortably, have developed their inertia, which is inevitable to give people an excuse and create obstacles to relief work.</p>
<p>The past is gone, the future can be pursued. For the remaining disabled, old, weak, widows and orphans, we can no longer treat them the same as before. This is the hope that the relief gentlemen should make overall calculations as soon as possible, although this work is bound to be more difficult. At the same time, there is one more point that cannot be said, that is, the expenditure of the "Relief Association" itself must be frugal as much as possible, and no money can be wasted, because in the future, the relief funds will probably only come from the refugee donation income.</p>
<h3>Calling on Schools with Missed Classes to Strive for Remediation</h3>
<p>— Liyan</p>
<p>Time flies like running water, and the summer vacation at the end of the academic year is coming soon. From the autumn semester to the summer vacation, among the 52 weeks in a year, excluding various statutory holidays and personal class suspensions (such as school anniversaries, and exhibitions, competitions, visits, etc.), the actual number of days for studying is very small, especially for students on isolated islands. Due to the special environment, the classrooms are economical, and when encountering teachers who take leave at will, the homework is further discounted, which is really very little.</p>
<p>Logically, schools should teach the progress of various subjects according to the procedures stipulated by the Ministry of Education. There is a certain standard for what level a certain subject should be taught each year. However, some schools have unsound organizations, do not carefully select teachers, and there are often changes in personnel. Teachers are often changed, and classes are often missed. In addition, the winter vacation starts earlier than other families and the school starts later than other families. During the winter vacation, students can still attribute the fact that the books have not been taught according to the planned progress to driving fast in the next semester to finish them. Now that the summer vacation is coming soon, if you do not quickly mend the fold after losing the sheep, and let it be missing all the time, the students will not have enough numbers. Then, whether it is upgrading, transferring schools, or taking exams, the level is too insufficient, and the students are too disadvantaged. It seems that the school authorities should take some responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that while there is still more than a month before the start of the summer vacation, for the sake of the students' studies in all levels of schools in Shanghai, I request the enlightened authorities of Shanghai schools to carefully estimate and count whether some major courses have been missed too much due to various personnel issues in the past, and have not met the legal schedule; if so, now we must quickly make overall plans and strive for remedial measures, using various holidays and extra time, and even slightly extending the school term and shortening the summer vacation, so that students can make up for the courses they should learn in a school year, so that there are no deficiencies. This is not only worthy of the students and their families, but also the responsibility that should be fulfilled in one's personal duties. I hope that the enlightened school authorities can accept and implement this humble opinion.</p>
<h3>Don't Be a Teacher</h3>
<p>— Qiao</p>
<p>Mr. Li Ziru of the former generation once wrote a couplet to describe the life of a teacher:</p>
<p>In the sad night rain, under the plantain window, lighting half a lamp, correcting the particles of the students.</p>
<p>Looking back at the autumn wind and laurel courtyard, only a bald pen remains, planning for the family's firewood, rice, oil and salt.</p>
<p>Mr. Xia Gaizun also wrote a couplet himself:</p>
<p>It's better to die early than to suffer,</p>
<p>There's nothing I can do but be a teacher because I'm poor.</p>
<p>Now someone is writing the following couplet:</p>
<p>It's better to die early,</p>
<p>Don't be a teacher!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 24: The Lakes and Mountains are Washed, Each with Its Own Charm, Men and Women Cheer Together and Shout Long Live</p>
<p>They sat for a while in the Freedom Village Elementary School, and Zhu Airen said: "The old grandfather means to stay for dinner." Zhu Ai said again: "However, we are far from the countryside here, and there is nothing delicious to eat. It is really very simple. But the countryside also has its own flavor. It is not bad to eat a meal occasionally and change the taste. I want to invite everyone to appreciate the light." Mrs. Suriya listened and applauded her approval first. She is the most frank American wife. When people want to be polite a few more times, she has already agreed, and there is nothing to say. Zhu Airen then said: "Let's go and see the factory site together at this moment." Everyone still took the family travel car, at that time there was one more Mr. Zhu in the car. It is not far from going to the elementary school, a piece of land near the canal is only seven or eight acres in size. If you want to develop it, there are still twenty or thirty acres to expand into it. On the opposite side of the canal is Water Bamboo Village. If you want to go to the opposite Water Bamboo Village, there is a Xie Martyr Temple about a mile away from here, which was built to commemorate Xie Martyr who died in the Anti-Japanese War during the war. You have to go around this bridge to reach the neighboring village. Lin Jiancheng was very satisfied after looking at this Guan address, he said: "Although land transportation is very developed in China now, water transportation is even more convenient. There are seven or eight acres of land along the river here, which is probably enough. If it is not enough, you can also expand it at any time, there are still twenty or thirty miles, you have also ordered a priority right to lease the land." The factory building is planned to be built with three floors, including warehouses, workers' dormitories, offices, wharves, etc. In addition, isn't the father of the two Miss He, Mr. He, going to build a villa? This villa must not necessarily be along the river, because he just dislikes Shanghai being too noisy, so he wants to live in the village and take it a little quieter. Moreover, the area does not have to be too large, and there is no need to build any gardens. One or two acres of land is enough." Lin Jiancheng based on its address, used his notebook to draw a rough sketch first, to get a general idea, and then planned in detail. It turned out that Village Chief Zhu was indeed an old gentleman after all, and he wanted to preserve the rural style of this Freedom Village. But from Lin Jiancheng's point of view, judging from the environment of Freedom Village and its trend, it is obvious that Freedom Village will become a new industrial village. Because since China's post-war recovery, it has gradually changed from an agricultural country to a country that attaches equal importance to agriculture and industry, like the United States and Soviet Russia. Many inland areas are improving agriculture and promoting animal husbandry, while more open areas, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, are experiencing a booming industry. They can't accommodate many factories in large metropolitan areas, and they naturally disperse to the nearby towns and villages. (Eight Two)</p>
