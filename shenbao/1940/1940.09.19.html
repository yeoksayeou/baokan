<h3>極權制度與世界前途</h3>
<p>距今百四十年之前，正是民主的法國新發於硎時的候；拿破崙曾以其無敵大軍掃蕩整個歐陸，法國革命的信條亦即隨其兵鋒所及，到處傾覆封建制度，含孕法國革命精神的拿破崙法典，並在荷蘭和郞巴地等地建立了模倣法國政制的民主共和國。在當時彷彿公認法國式的民主政制是有史以來最合理的制度，可以傳之久遠而不移。然而一世紀以上的演變遞嬗，已充分證明了歷史的殘酷；往昔拿翁的地位，及今已爲希特勒所替代，風靡全歐，甚至全世界的政制，似乎已經不應該是民主，而是極權了。</p>
<p>遠在此屆歐戰尚未發生之前，若干國家，爲了應付內外的艱鉅，已在或多或少的模倣着極權國家的制度。到歐戰前夜，全歐洲只有北歐和西歐數國尚保持着民主的傳統，及至戰事席捲北歐，挪丹荷比相繼被納粹吞噬，法國復以敗北而結束其百五十年的光榮歷史；歐洲碩果僅存的三個民主國：英國方困於生死關頭的最後決鬥，瑞典則逼處蘇德兩大之間，至於瑞士，其民主政體在歐洲雖有悠久的榮譽，最近亦因國社黨勢力的膨脹，釀成政局的動盪。此外史如羅馬尼亞，前此已屬君主獨裁，近自國土割裂及卡洛爾被迫退位之後，安托尼斯科的政權更亦步亦趨的效倣着極權主義的設施。是以以今日歐洲局勢而論：極權主義的威脅已達到最高峯，而民主制度則遭際了百五十年來所未嘗有的嚴重危機。在歐洲以外，在美洲除却美墨智利阿根廷等國家而外，若干拉丁美洲國家都逐漸由民主趨嚮到極權。在日本則孕育多年的法西斯運動，近亦以近衛的新政體制而屆於實現。雖然墨索里尼曾經講過：「法西斯主義不是輸出品」，但極權政制却不斷的隨着軸心國家勢力的膨脹移植到其他國家，如果德義再在歐戰中獲得優勢，無疑此一趨勢當益見發展。</p>
<p>在這裹並不想批判民主與極權二者的短長，也不準備論斷上述趨勢究屬淮化還是反動。所感關切的，只是極權制度之風靡一時，對於將來之國際形勢具何影響？是吾能使在動盪與敵對中的國際關係獲得安定？當然，這一問題，只有在歐戰決勝之後纔能獲得確切解答；茲姑就極權制度本身試一推測其未來歸趨。</p>
<p>極權政權含有兩個基本要點：極端的國家主義與對內的嚴格統制。德義若干人民之所以甘於含苦茹辛以支持政府之嚴格統制者，無非因爲納粹與法西斯都以對外解除覊絆或建立功業相標榜，乃能引起人民憧憬並獲得其擁護；同時，這也就是極權國家必須不斷從事對外擴展或侵略的主因。更就傾向極權制度的動機而論，可以分別爲兩種：一是第五縱隊的煽動，一是對於德義成就的豔羨。在歐洲改變政制的國家中，自然有些是內外遭受脅迫的結果，但最大多數還是因爲欣慕德義成就而竭力學步，企圖由改變政制獲得類似的成就。即如法國和羅馬尼亞的改制，也很難相信其現任當局只是一味甘做軸心附庸而不企求國土的恢復及復興。因之，在這些國家中，也就小會不强調其國家主義的立塲。但這種趨勢如果繼續發展下去，必然會形成軸心國家支配歐洲的阻力，並適和德義的欲求相遠反。</p>
<p>納粹與法西斯都是反國際主義的。所謂法西斯的國際，不過是空中樓閣：而希特勒所計劃的歐洲聯邦，却以德國爲其盟主。假使希特勒的計劃實現，必須取消歐洲各個國家的主權：其最低限度，亦必竭力縮減各國主權而悉以置於納粹支配之下。縱然德國希望其所支配諸國在政制上都納粹化，那一定也是片面的：僅加强內部統制而剔除其國家主義的成分；因爲若非如此，即無從形成德國的支配。這套辦法，當然絕非那些改採極權政制的國家所甘心，而那種學步德義成就的企圖，也並非軸心國家所樂聞；如果那種企圖能確實獲得成功，則所形成者必然是軸心國家的敵對者而非其附庸。即以德義二國而論，如果不是至今還有共同的敵國存在，則彼此之能吾長此和平共處，實爲重大疑問。而極權政制的本身，也只是在準備作戰過程中，纔具有特殊功效。</p>
<p>拿破崙的遠征，曾經促成各國民族觀念的發展，同樣今日希特勒的擴展亦必引起各國國家主義的抬頭；但極權主義的成就，却未必能與民主主義相比擬。蓋民主制度曾保障了個人的權利和自由，並且替這個世界帶來過秩序和和牛－縱然那並不澈底；但隨着極權主義以俱來的，却只有支配和擴展。極權政制之風行全世界只是暗示着未來更大的對立和矛盾，除非軸心國家的軍事勝利能將其他國家的民族主義或國家主義掃除淨盡，或者可以形成相當的安定，但是這是小容想像的事，這種情勢適足證明墨索里尼「法西斯主義不是輸出品」一語確含有相當眞理。</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（九）　法國屈服的內幕</h3>
<p>本文是紐約Herald　Tribune駐歐訪員和英國Manchester　Gnardian前任駐巴黎訪員的報告，茲分別譯錄如下：</p>
<p>法國此次慘敗，實為該國建立以來所不之前閱，或者亦為所有戰爭史上所罕見。德軍進攻不過六星期，法軍當卽不得不籲請停戰，此種敗衂，以視一八七〇年普法之戰，尤為慘烈，蓋當年法王拿破崙三世雖曾向普五威廉交出實力，巴仁將軍雖曾率軍投降，但巴黎守軍猶能支持數月之久，草草改編；法軍在承認戰敗之前，猶能一再予德軍以打擊。</p>
<p>但在此次之戰，法軍作戰雖勇，迄未取獲一次勝利。德軍自五月十日採取攻勢，及至色當　近衛過繆斯河之後，法軍卽節節敗退，終　一敗舉塗地，不可收拾。</p>
<p>法軍官兵三百萬，戰前素以歐洲最優秀軍隊著稱，何致一厥不振至於此極。法總理員當將軍曾廣播演說，闡明法軍之敗，由於軍備不足，士兵太少，英國援助不力。德軍飛機六倍於聯軍。法軍人數較一九一七年减少五十萬人，前綫英軍僅十師，一九一七年前綫英軍則有八十五師。上次大戰時，法方尚有義大利軍五十八師與美軍四十二師助戰，此次則義國已對法作戰，美國則保守中立。</p>
<p>法方人力物力之减低，乃一嚴得的阻碍，自無疑義。然更重要者，厥為德軍士氣呈旺盛，將領指揮有方。德軍當局明瞭現代戰爭中，戰車，鐵甲車與機械化部隊之重要，遂將其發展至最高限度。德方料及此種武器足以進行運動戰，乃法軍參謀部仍拘泥於取之不盡地戰。</p>
<p>所堪浩歡者，法國若干少壯將領，早已料及此次戰爭，必取運動戰戰術。現在倫敦駐法國民埃委員會長之特戈爾將軍卽其一也。彼曾於一九三四年著書，闡述摩托化部隊能在敵軍陣綫後獨立作戰，破壞橋樑及軍火庫，而不必顧慮自已軍隊之交通綫。</p>
<p>法國前總理萊諾對於特戈爾之意見，頗爲感動，乃在衆議院演說時主張重用摩托化部隊。惜法國陸軍中其頑不靈之當局不加置信，縱德軍在進行波蘭作戰情形，亦未能使之醒悟，而續以馬奇諾防綫是輯，以爲堅守此水泥鋼骨牆垣，卽可補救人力與武器之不足。不幸馬奇諾防綫僅造至盧森堡邊界莫米第爲止，而未沿比國邊界直展至英倫海峽。</p>
<p>因此，德軍乃能突破色當之法軍陣地，以拊馬奇諾防綫之背。該處陣地之突破，乃後來法軍慘敗之關鍵所在。法方自始拘泥於上次大戰時之戰略，以爲德軍主力仍將假道比國進攻，故此次德軍開始進攻荷比兩國時，卽派最精銳之機械化部隊九師及全部英軍，前往應戰。</p>
<p>但德方戰略已異於一九一四年之戰役，而以其主力猛攻亞丁森林區。法方守軍爲柯賴普將軍所率配備較劣之次等軍隊，且無預備隊，以資增援。德軍旣破柯賴普軍，卽可直取巴黎，其所以不卽進佔巴黎者，乃以截斷法蘭德斯聯軍，允爲亟切也。</p>
<p>法方顯信繆斯河與亞丁森林，均爲天險，德軍無衝突可能，故設防較弱。詎知德軍竟出法方意料之外，而在該方面發動攻勢。</p>
<p>幸賴鄧扣克防務堅强，英軍主力及大部份法軍，乃得自法蘭德斯安全撤退。其最精良之配備，則喪失殆盡。嗣德方移師直指巴黎，法軍雖奮勇作戰，但對德軍戰車衝鋒陷陣，無法抵抗。</p>
<p>迨至六月十六日，法內閣在波爾多召集緊急會議，萊諾總理中張，法國唯一出路，蹶在會同英國賡續作戰。英國軍備日見充實，並有大批戰車與飛機可從美國運到。法國海軍猶居歐洲第二位，應會同英艦隊繼續封鎖，制德國死命。</p>
<p>然閣員中希望作戰到底者，如萊諾總理及殖民部長。孟台爾等人，被大多數不顧代價以求和之閣員所反對。貝富上將（年八十四藏）與魏剛將軍（年七十叫歲）兩老一言，遂決定大局。兩老皆謂，賡續作戰，徒然流血，實鮮效果。據小巴黎人報所載，前總理賴伐爾（現任副總理）曾斥萊諾主張赴北菲作戰曰，「放棄國家，何能救國。」、此言洵可代表大多數閣員之意見。</p>
<p>下面是曼哲斯德衛報前任駐巴黎訪員的報告：</p>
<p>法國乞和之始末，日後當有史家爲之紀錄，目下則仍難確言法國之屈服，責在何人。然據紀者在波爾多時所得片斷消息，並對貝當政府及其左右人物，一加考察，法國何故屈服，已可約略獲一解答。</p>
<p>法國之降，實係一小部份軍人政客出賣法國人民，毫無疑義。所成問題者，厥爲若輩當初決定罷兵時所希望者究爲何物。今停戰條件已經接受。其令人更大惑不解者，貝當政府及其左右人物所希望者必勝於此，乃仍接受此種驚人條件，其故果安在耶。</p>
<p>法國境內暗中散佈法國將單獨媾和消息者，由來已久。猶憶萊諾總理在參議院發表著名演說，宣布埃拉斯與亞眠安兩地陷落之日，卽有人散布消息，暗示勒勃侖總統極贊成單獨媾和。</p>
<p>其後一星期，一般人所注意者，無非鄧扣克戰爭情形。直至六月第二星期，德軍始對巴黎展開總攻。六月八日。法國陸軍部中猶有樂觀空氣，對」魏剛防綫」竟能扼守兩日，似感驚異。嗣德軍從繆斯河以破竹之勢，直衝英倫海峽各口岸，法國之信心必隨之减退。不出所料，樂觀空氣次日一變而爲陰鬱景象矣。官方發言人湯瑪斯上校曾謂此乃「決定的一日，」德軍攻法者有一百師之衆云。</p>
<p>其後數日，巴黎居民避奔他鄉，絡繹不絕，陰鬱氣象益見深沉。多處地方雖有激戰，然各處法軍，但見退却，未聞大舉反攻。六月十三日，萊諾總理在都爾發表驚人之言，謂法國卽剩一省，縱退至北菲，亦當作戰。彼又以法國賡繼作戰力量，端賴續獲得外援一事，訴諸美總統羅斯福。此項演說之涵意，厥爲法軍在國內之抵抗力業已崩潰，唯美國能使法國不致全部崩潰。特此顯非一朝一夕所能爲之事。或謂萊諾之演說，巳微露屈服之意，此於法軍，影響甚爲惡劣。</p>
<p>萊諾共人固具誠意，惜無何種魄力，未能如上次大戰時「老虎」總理克萊孟梭之能激勵民衆。彼且無潑辣手段。縱調孟台爾長內政，彼對內部亦惟以妥洽爲事所擇閣員不善，允屬失着，致其「主戰」內閣自始卽感受惡勢力，其主戰意志，或不若外料之堅決。萊諾總理兼長陸軍外交，孟台爾長內政，年邁之馬林反德極力，固屬事實；惟有數人，如外交部秘書長雷傑爾與總理公署秘書長巴魯斯基，實不宜罷免。</p>
<p>萊諾之戰時內閣中，抱失敗論者，主張親義大利者，傾向法西斯者，及自認「法國老大」之頹唐派，無不俱備。應負法國邊防崩潰責任之達拉第及欽佩墨索里尼者，如特蒙齊兩氏，雖皆已去職，然萊諾政府中仍多可疑份子，如賴伐爾之友弗洛薩，法國鄉村主和者代表旭丹，名不見經傳之外交次長波多恩及情報部長卽巴黎晚報發行人普洛伏斯德等人，比比皆是。記者將離巴黎時，普洛伏斯德曾招待英國新聞記者，其言論平淡無奇，對英法合作，顯乏信心。此外尚有貝當上將及其忠誠之伊巴納加萊，皆係西班牙元首弗朗哥將軍之至友。貝當爲弗朗哥之言所動，期望德國向法提出光榮的媾和條件，並信雙方能以軍人資格，進行和議。</p>
<p>殆至六月十六日，法內閣在波爾多召集緊急會議，萊諾，孟台爾，馬林，及陶脫利諸人猶力言繼續作戰，惟閣議完畢，萊諾已以辭職聞，貝當政府亦遽告成立。陸軍部長魏剛顯已確定法國無力繼續作戰矣。</p>

<h3>九一八平靜無事　滬各界鎭定奮發　願效法邱吉爾苦幹精神　爲正義奮鬥盡國民天職</h3>
<p>昨日兩租界當局、爲謀安渡起見、除警務處中西探捕·萬國商團·及義勇隊全體出動外，事先並函請各國駐滬防軍司令、於是日派隊分赴各區協助防務、愛多亞路英法租界毘連處非衝要馬路昨日續有封鎖、各缺口處所駐中西探捕、亦一律增加、對往來行人車輛、檢查綦嚴、全市游藝塲所、均自動停止營業、各級學校、爲確保學生安全計、亦放假一天、本市各界、因時値非常、爲與當局表示合作起見、故無所舉動、惟以英國正在爲正義而苦戰、於敬佩之餘、亦竊願效法邱吉爾之苦幹精神、以完成中國國民之天職、是以昨日在兩租界當局嚴密之防範下、界內秩序井然、並未發生不幸事件、茲將情形分誌於后、</p>
<p>租界武力　全部出動</p>
<p>兩租界警務當局、於前晚開始嚴峻戒備後、昨日情形、益趨緊張、如缺口處之搜查工作、已加嚴執行、界內若干處所、並受巡邏隊及警捕之搜查、鐵甲車之巡邏、亦大爲活躍、各國防軍、昨均出動、各馬路之堡壘、昨均爲防軍進駐、嚴密監視一切車輛、在各該防區巡邏、並協助巡捕執行搜查、萬國商團亦仍負乙丁兩區之警戒工作、但除白俄隊及AB兩大隊外、未全部動員、</p>
<p>五座橋樑　均予封鎖</p>
<p>昨日蘇州河沿岸各橋樑之戒備狀况、計完全封鎖者、爲江西路橋·山西路橋·烏鎭路橋·新閘橋·舢板廠橋等五座、烏鎮路·舢板廠·新閘三橋之北端、均駐有美軍二名、荷槍守衛、其餘外白渡橋·乍浦路橋·四川路橋·河南路橋·新閘橋·老垃圾橋·虞洽卿路橋等均照常開放、南北兩端、由捕房加派大批中西探捕嚴密搜查行人物件、並將鐵絲網架移置近橋樑中心處、中間留有孔道、備車輛往來、</p>
<p>浦江船隻　尙無限制</p>
<p>黃浦江中、咋亦實施嚴峻之戒備、水巡捕房之警備船只、昨晨起一律出動、在浦江巡弋、搜查可疑船只、日海軍巡艦、亦不時巡邏搜查、但船只出入、尚無限制、外灘沿浦江各碼頭、除羅斯福·新關等數處外、大部均遭封鎖、其開放者並各駐有大批警探、嚴密戒備、至浦東·楊樹浦·虹口·及蘇州河上游一部碼頭、亦爲日方封鎖、僅留重要者、以供出入、該處檢查、亦殊嚴密、</p>
<p>滬西邊界　滿佈鐵網</p>
<p>公共租界當局、對滬西防務、殊爲重視、與「歹土」毘連之各馬路、如康腦脫路·延平路勞勃生路·延平路膠州路·新閘路·愛文義路·極司非而路等各路口、均佈有鐵絲網、希駐有大批意軍及探補檢查行人車輛甚嚴、滬西越界築路地段、因居民爲謹愼起見、絕少外出、故景况凄凉、日憲兵昨在該區列隊巡邏、並檢查行人、情形頗爲緊張、</p>
<p>特別戒備　繼續施行</p>
<p>自一九一八一安然渡過後對兩租界當局之特別戒備辦法、聞警務當局將繼續施行、各種車輛與行人、仍須受嚴格之搜查、各重要路口之鐵絲網障碍物亦未撤除、以便依照當局預定計劃、撲滅一切恐怖活動、兩租界對於宵禁、執行甚嚴、今後仍將繼續如此、同時蘇州河北區之空氣、則頗爲平靜嚴肅、蓋因日僑正向在蒙古因飛機失事而死之白川親王舉行追悼、前昨二晚、虹口日人所開之夜總會及娛樂塲、均一律休業、但歐籍僑民所開之咖啡館、仍照常營業、</p>
<p>防範得當　平靜過去</p>
<p>因兩租界警務當局之防範得當、故終日平安無故、惟在南京路·河南路·愛多亞路·海寗路·寗波路·辣斐德路等各處馬路、發現大批粉筆書寫之標語、叉昨日下午八時許、法租界鄭家木橋·法國花園一帶、有靑年數人、發散紀念傳單標語、內容甚爲前進、又昨晚永安公司大東茶室以及大新公司等處、均發現同樣傳單、叉在處洽卿路南京路口各汽車中、亦有靑年散發此項傳單、</p>
<p>娛樂塲所　昨均休業</p>
<p>公共租界及法租界各公共娛樂塲所因昨爲紀念日、全市市民、停止娛樂、故均宣告休息一天、如黃金·共舞臺等大戲院、辣斐·大中華·等話劇　、皇后·天香·大來·老閘·民樂·等小型劇塲、及大世界等遊藝塲、均宜告停業一天、其他各西人影院雖照常開演、惟觀衆均屬外人、</p>
<p>A字大隊　今晚調防</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、上海萬國商團在公共租界「乙」防區之虹口西區担任防務、採用循環　、其第二次循環週、將於明日（十九日）午後八時告終、屆時自上星期日晚間起接防之商團B字大隊、將由A字大隊冉度調防、查B字大隊計有美國隊·美機關槍隊與葡萄牙隊、A字大隊隊員人數最多、故明日起將賡續出防七八日、該防區自英軍西福資高地隊撤退後、由商團塡防至今、已歷四週、目下商團暫防辦法、將賡續多久、仍未可斷言、官方對此、無所發表、然據情狀觀之、現行辦法、暫時不致有何變動、同時、美日兩國進行關於上海防區之談判、仍無消息可得、故本市局勢、近期內必不致有何變更、</p>
<h3>法租界集中營慘劇　蔣委長極重視　已令外部向法嚴重交涉　改善待遇保留要求權利</h3>

<h3>謝晋元沉慟報吿　一孤軍被擊死　自俄衛兵開槍肇此慘劇　另一孤軍亦中彈受重傷　工部局董事會昨開會討論仍待續商</h3>
<p>膠州路四行孤軍營士兵、自十四日與駐守該營之白俄國丁發生衝突後、爲時將吉一週、孤軍方面、雖曾向工部局提出撤銷封鎖及恢復自由兩項要求、但迄今未能解決、昨（十八日）日改局舉行董事會議時、對此衝突事件、華董虞洽卿氏、曾卽席提出報告、惟對孤軍死傷一節、因未得詳細報告、故無從證實、聞討論結果、決令商團司令亨培上校提出詳細報告後、再行召集董事會議討論、</p>
<p>孤軍一名中彈殞命</p>
<p>在孤軍與白俄團丁衝突事件尚未獲解決之際、詎昨據可靠方面報告、昨日上午十一時五十分、膠州路四行孤軍營內又發生嚴重衝突事件、發生經過不詳、惟悉白俄團丁曾開槍兩響、有孤軍一名當塲被擊斃命、現孤軍與白俄又陷入對峙狀態中、形勢甚緊張、英文大美晚報云、膠州路孤軍營、今（十八日）晨寗靜無事、至午後一時、又肇事端、因孤軍士兵兩名、向守營白俄商團兩人投磚、白俄竟開槍兩響、致華兵一名、中彈殞生、</p>
<p>謝晋元之沉慟聲明</p>
<p>孤軍營謝團長晋元昨發出油印文如下、『本營靠馬路之圍牆、牆上設有鐵絲網、牆下爲澡堂、弟兄在此說話、習以爲常、本日（十八日）上午十一時五十分、有十兵數名、在鐵絲網空隙處向外說話、殊料距約數步之馬路站崗白俄衛兵、舉檢瞄準制止、弟兄置之不理，該白俄卽開槍射擊、彈由前額入、貫穿腦部、立時畢命、同時站於左邊另一白俄、亦提槍瞄準射擊、重傷一名生死非所顧、余等已準備隨時爲公理正義及世界文明而犧牲、決不惜任何代價、奮鬥到底、余茲向上海民衆請求、吾人犧牲後、請收吾人屍骨、歸還我政府、再本日新聞有謝團長向外報記者發表、前日衝突重傷殞命三名一節、並不確實、合卽辨正、謝晋元、」</p>
<h3>工部局　發言人談</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局發言人今（十八日）晨否認孤軍團長謝晋元所指各節、據稱、數日來膠州路孤軍營發生紛擾時、未有喪生情事、謝團長雖謂白俄商團與消防隊使用暴烈方法、致孤軍士兵中毒垂斃者數人、負傷者十餘人、然所用僱淚瓦斯與自來水、皆係無害之物、未必能致人死命、</p>
<p>非經調查不能發表</p>
<p>該發言人又稱、孤軍要求重獲自由、而向守營商團投磚示威時、苟受嚴重傷害、應由孤軍自負其責、除非孤軍昕擲磚石撞返、擊中本身、則彼等不致受其他傷害云、記者問工部局對孤軍擬取何種行動、發言人答稱、對於此事非待充分調查、則局方尚不能發表文告云、</p>
<p>衆信雙方　即可磋商</p>
<p>同時孤軍營與法租界華軍集中營情况、今晨已較寗靜、公共租界官方人士仍以彼等迄未能與孤軍長官進行討論爲言、惟一般相信雙方或將於一二日內舉行磋商、法租界當軸謂法租界集中營情况、可認爲恢復常態、但官方人士對星期一日午後該營發生衝突時、華兵遭開槍射擊死傷若干、仍拒不正式宜佈、</p>
<h3>邱長蔭　傳將釋放</h3>
<p>本月十五日報載旅滬南潯富商邱長蔭、於十三日下午在同孚路一百八十四號寓所被日憲兵隊會同公共租界警務人員掃去、指爲其項嫌疑、茲據社聞社記者調查所得、邱氏並非南潯籍係已故顏料巨璧邱謂卿之次予、今年十八歲、揚州人、自逮捕後、經捕房偵查結果、幷無某項嫌疑、故將邱氏暫行覊押於捕房、幷聞現正由邱之親友卜少知向各方奔走營救、據悉邱不日卽可恢復自由、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局警務處上星期五日應提當局之請、而逮捕本市鉅富邱長蔭、拘捕原因何在、警務處迄今拒不披露、又警務處對於昨（十七日）在普渡路區逮捕華人廿三名、亦緘口不談、</p>
<h3>工部局特別經濟委員會　調查捐稅收入　印行公報擬議招標承辦　敎育措施經委會難負責</h3>

<p>公報印刷</p>
<p>工部局發行英文公報、遠在一九〇八年、其印刷及分發、向委由字林西報館擔任、共後其他各報對於此種制度、往往表示不滿、即經本局與納稅人年會以及上年八月間經本局指定之一特別委員會、相繼討論、結果僉以上項發行制度、係屬最經濟而最滿意者、毋庸變更、但降至今日、公報之印行、有應行提請更張者、緣自公報改爲每月發行一次以後、所有局內重要措施、均隨時刊諸報端、使報紙成爲本局公告之主要媒介物、於是公報之作用、僅爲一種參考物性質、對於公衆之價値、已失其重要性、再查目下英文公報、每次發行一萬一千份、此數是吾確有必要、似屬疑問、苟本局繼續採行利用報紙刋布公告之改革、則本委員會擬向局方提議、一、各納稅外僑如欲索閱英文公報者、可通知本局總辦處、以便彙案登記、而後分別郵寄、二、公報之印行、應卽採取公開招標方式、以上辦法、倘經採行、當可减縮公報之份數、並節省經費不少、至於華文公報、每月約印五千四百份、向由納稅華人會代爲分發、此後可照常辦理、但鑒於英文公報之可以减縮、擬請局方與該會討論、可吾採取與英文報之同樣步驟、茲此項報告、亦經該局董事會採納矣、</p>
<p>敎育措施</p>
<p>關於本局敎育措施之各方面、本委員會認爲能力有限、未便加以研究、擬請局方委由另一委員會負責檢討、</p>

<h3>已故護士長之父　被控淸償債務　訴追李玉英殯葬費用　中西療養院拒付此款</h3>

<p>代爲成殮並安葬於虹橋公墓、共計費用一千餘元、殯儀館已將賬單交與中西療養院、轉交尸屬、亦爲遺債案內系爭之賬目、乃因中西療養院拒付此款、爰由中國殯儀館經理陶飯吾委律師代理、在特二法院民庭對李玉英之父李世珍提起</p>

<p>社會</p>
<h3>人世間的天堂</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>廣大無垠的世界裏，個人不過是洪濤裏飛濺的一點水沫，渺小得不足稱道。個人之於社會，也不過是巨大建築物中的一片磚石。誰不會相信一個偉大的建築，因爲一片磚石的不成材而不能建造得精美，但將因一片磚石的不成村而感到缺憾。</p>
<p>事實吿訴我們，人不能脫離社會而單獨生活，旦不論人類本性的是善是惡影響於人生有多大的關係，一切都是社會的賜予，是不能吾認的事。人自呱呱墮地以後，便受着家庭鄰里等本初羣體的薰陶，年齡漸長又受着學校社會等次級羣體的影響，奠定一切信仰，道德，習慣和知識的基礎，不健全的父母（當然包括一切知識道德上的健全）決不會孕育出優良的子女。我們不必苛責一切應該受責的人，因爲他們原和我們一樣接受了社會所賜予的一份遺產。</p>
<p>我們不能私自慶幸命運，吝嗇社會給我們優良的傳統。我們明知道人與人之間相互密切的關係，我們明知道不能超越地求得自身的獨善，眼見柳種沉墮的危險而忍不加以援手。不論任何人的動作，以及動作的性質如何，足以影響整個社會是必然的結果。因人類的動作社會纔能協合，爲人類全體，社會全局，也是爲了自己，我們不能讓今後的社會有一點瑕疵。</p>
<p>這確是一件艱鉅的事，不必感於自己的渺小而慨嘆，德國Rudolf　Eucken說：「我們有自知之明，知道我們不能冒充眞理的主人，不過必須從事於眞理的發現。」我們得把握眞理，眞理決不會因我們的渺小而顯得渺小，相反地，個人的渺小將因眞理而變爲偉大。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>科學怪傑愛因斯坦</h3>
<p>— 凌崇眞</p>
<p>當愛因斯坦五十壽辰的時候，德國舉國歡騰，送給他一所房子和一隻小舟，又爲他造像，以示慶祝。想不到幾年後的今日，他不獨農失了全部財產，而且還要亡命比利時，蟄居寡出，晚上僱一位警察，睡在他的榻旁，保護他的性命。現在他巳經從比利時逃到美國，在紐的普靈斯敦大學高級數學院內担任敎授，而且已經歸化美國了。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦秉性恬靜，敝屣尊榮，不慕名利。有一次有一位船主在航行大西洋的輪船上，爲他特備幾問富麓堂皇的房間，以示優渥，誰知他毫不猶豫地說：我寗願坐統艙，而不願接受此極優待。」</p>
<p>愛因期坦說世界上眞正了解相對論的人，一共只有十二個，雖然討論他的相對論的書藉，有九百多本之多。</p>
<p>「譬如你坐在一位可愛的女郞的身旁，一個鐘頭會快得像一分鐘；但是如果你坐在灼熱的火爐的旁邊，一分鐘便會好像一個錡頭了。」這就是相對論，愛因斯坦說。</p>
<p>我們應以堅定的信仰和高尙的思想，互相勉勵，互相督促。我們應將徘徊在罪惡的陷阱前的，引離歧路，以熱誠燃點起黑海的燈塔，在洶湧的波濤裹指示出光明的路。</p>
<p>我們必須以眞理灌溉自已，也得以眞理灌溉他人，要使每一株小草滋長爲有用的木材，要使每一片磚石成爲巨大的花崗岩，以建造人世間的天堂。</p>
<p>愛因期坦夫人承認她不明白相對論的理論，可是她明白一個爲妻子者更需要明白的東西：她明白她的丈夫。她說她的丈夫在思想上非常井井有條，但是在生活上恰正相反。他喜歡無論何時何地，想到什麼就做什麼。他律己的規則有兩條：第一，不要遵守任何規則。第二，不要被他人的意見左右自己的思想。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦的日常生活非常簡樸，平時穿的大都是陳舊而不很整齊的衣服，帽子是難得戴的。可是他有豐富快樂的人生，他快樂的哲理比較他的相對論似乎更爲偉大，他快樂的淵源完全由於他能够自給自足，不忮不求。在他工作，奏梵啞鈴，和駕小舟的時候，他找到人生，找到眞正的快樂了。</p>
<p>在柏林的時候，有一次他在公共汽車上說一個賣票員找結他的零錢不對，那個賣票員很仔細地再數一遍，發覺幷沒有錯誤，把錢交還他說：「先生，你的算學委實是太壞了。」</p>
<h3>努力</h3>
<p>— 吳積圻譯</p>
<p>你要知識，你得爲牠努力；你要麵包，你得爲牠努力；你要愉快，你也得爲牠努力。努力卽是方法。愉快是努力中走出的，而並非依靠任意作爲和苟且行事而生成的。當一僩人有愛好工作的心時，他的生活必當是最愉快。（J．Ruskin）（却酬）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第七章　「把他押起來」</p>
<p>霍桑說時兩隻嚴肅的眼睛始終盯住在那個圓胖的臉上。不過那雙靈活的眼睛，這時巳不靈不活，更沒有觸接霍桑視綫的勇氣。他祇凝視着地板上還沒有乾透的茶漬，暗暗在咬自己的嘴脣。</p>
<p>他勉强回答說：「你弄錯了，我！的確在那邊。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。「也好，這一點很容易證明，現在用不着說什麽廢話。第二點，昨夜裹大雨以後，你叫明進過王麗蘭家裹去，你却一再說送伊到了門口，不曾下車！」</p>
<p>他不等霍桑說完，忙搶着說：「笑話，我的確不曾下車。怎麽能進伊的屋裏去？」</p>
<p>霍桑緩緩說道：「可是伊屋子裏的地板上，明明留着你的足印－你的皮鞋印。」</p>
<p>「我的皮鞋印？太奇怪了！」他的神奇顯得很驚惶。</p>
<p>霍桑仍自顧自說：「我就爲着這個奇怪點，要把你押起來·金壽兄，擬看憑着這兩層理由，把他暫時押一押，準備作進一步的偵查，總不能算違法罷？」</p>
<p>倪金壽攢蹙着眉峯，舉着他的右手，用力搔他的下頷，分明他認爲這是一種難得遭遇的僵局，他却沒有方法打開。</p>
<p>陸健笙又瞧着他喘息地說：「倪探長，這是沒有的事！我可以用我的名譽作保證，我昨夜實在不曾進伊家裏去！我可以立誓，我當眞不曾進去！至於麗蘭的死，我更絕對沒有關係！我！我爲什麼要打死伊？我正要查明這個兇手！倪探長，你應得相信我。」他不但喘息，聲調也顫抖了。</p>
<p>倪余壽在無可奈何之中逼出了兩句勉强同情的話。「陸先生，我也相信你不會幹這件事。不過霍先生所說的兩點，的確也不容易解釋！」他的眼光瞧到霍桑臉上，似希望霍桑能給予一個可以轉園的表示。</p>
<p>這時我覺得霍桑的眼睛好像向倪余壽霎了一霎，這裏面明明有一種暗示，不過一時間，我解釋不出它的性質。</p>
<p>陸健笙又回頭來向霍桑說：「霍先生，你別誤會。我的確不曾打死麗蘭，打死伊的人是誰，祇要能查明白，我一定重車酬謝。霍先生，你你千萬不可誤會。」（一一一）</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>說和做</h3>
<p>— 汪霆</p>
<p>聽得過一句話：「德國人是做了不說，英國人是做了再說，日本人是說了就做，中國人是說了不做，印度人是不說不做。」</p>
<p>這裏，中國人被列爲第四等——雖然還位在印度人之上，然而印度是亡了國的民族，據說不能和咱們相提並論的；所以聽了這話，好些「炎黃後裔」們都憤憤不平，覺得「不勝感慨」起來。</p>
<p>覺得「不勝感慨」其實到還有點出息——感慨之後，自然想到要做點事了，眞正令人「不勝感慨」的，是有些人在「憤憤」之後，却這麽想：「咱們幾千年的精神文明，你懂得什麽？」，或者：「說了不做，比一聲不響總好一點。」</p>
<p>前一種說話是抱了廢銅爛鐵而緬想祖先的「光榮」的敗落子弟的口吻，後一種就是幾千年來一直蘊藏在我們民族的心底的阿Q精神的表現。</p>
<p>這兩種人，口吻雖異，然而其「沒出息」是一樣的。只是誇耀祖先的「光榮」和闊的敗落子弟之終於做不出什麽事來，果然誰亦無疑，而說了不做之比不聲不響，亦並不「好一點」</p>
<p>要從敗落中振作起來，耍在空喊與嘆氣的可詛咒的環境中殺出一條血路，必得先覺到點感慨才行，必得先淸楚自己的腐敗的病源才行！</p>
<p>這樣才能在感慨之後，在淸楚自已的病源之後，切切實實的起來做一點事，對症下藥地醫治自己的老病！</p>
<p>中國年來似乎確有許多人在感慨之後，淸楚了自己的病源，在切切實實的做事了。這自然是可喜的現象。然而從另一方面說來，「說了不做」的現象至今尙未完全消滅，却亦是國家民族的恥辱！</p>
<p>所以不能完全消滅掉，我以爲：還在前面兩種人之並未全部淸楚自已的病源，或雖巳明白，却不會對症下藥去治療的緣故。</p>
<p>三年來使中國始終支持着一個爭自由的抗戰的力量的，並不是傳統的所謂精神文明，並不是我們祖先的「光榮」，而是許多以前「說了不做」的人們，現在却在切切實實地工作所發揮出的驚人的大力！</p>
<p>新中國的長成是有賴於大家切實地做的！</p>
<h3>白金漢宮　六條格言</h3>
<p>— 天水</p>
<p>近日被炸的英國倫敦白金漢宮中，御書房的牆壁上，貼着下面六條格言：</p>
<p>（一）競技時應守規則。</p>
<p>（二）宜重情，不宜濫用感情，兩者當加分別。</p>
<p>（三）無聊的語言，不可出口，亦不可接受。</p>
<p>（四）倘受到磨折，應學良好的獸類，默忍地走去。</p>
<p>（五）能勝則勝，不能勝時，就做一漂亮的失敗者。</p>
<p>（六）不要對月流涕，亦不要對潑翻的牛奶流涕。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>漫談靑年鬚生</h3>
<p>— 語初</p>
<p>後輩鬚生行中，昨今兩年之作首次來滬獻藝者，前有沙世鑫，及今正出演更新之遲世恭。聞黃金近又有邀李和曾為新艷秋袴刀，繼李盛藻後局露演之說。上述三人，其宗派各異，藝事亦</p>
<p>各有千秋</p>
<p>沙世鑫前番來滬，成績並不佳妙，其失敗之最大原因，厥為嗓音悶黯所致。彼之戲路，唱白，頗有幾分神似連良處，其扮相行頭允酷肖，故有小馬連良之稱。前觀其首夕之甘露寺，反不及為其配演劉備之貫盛習受台下歡迎，且大有喧賓奪主之勢。臨別日塲，貼全部法門寺，行路之「郿塢縣」一段，唱句漏去一節，落得滿堂倒彩，此子此行誠屬不幸之至。現在平定當埋首苦幹，以圖他日來申，一雪前恥也。遲世恭與世鑫係富連成社</p>
<p>同科弟兄</p>
<p>扮相頗淸秀，台風大方，做工亦老到，惜乎嗓音稍低，唱腔却富有韻味，拔高處亦能應付，加之有前幫楊寳森操琴之耿少峯為之襯托，更能生色不少。前聽共泡戲空城計，城頭之西皮慢板及二六兩段均佳，允共「散淡的人」一句，得哄堂彩聲，設嗓音更能宏亮，前途有厚望焉。其戲路純正，全宗老派唱腔亦不以</p>
<p>新奇取勝</p>
<p>與譚富英有相似處，且富英與世恭先後在更新以空城計打泡，適不謀而合，故稱其為小譚富英，亦無不當。李和曾為戲校之高材生，扮相淸苦，純以唱工見長，嗓音頗高亢宏亮，做工道白稍差，所擅之戲，若哭秦庭，逍遙津，贈綈袍諸劇，均為高慶奎當年之拿手佳構。蓋係一劃一不二之小型高慶奎也。和曾在平，嘗自行</p>
<p>挑班出演</p>
<p>成績頗佳。此番黃金設能留慶奎在滬，繼為其得意弟子把塲，則和曾之能一唱而紅，更有把握矣。他若戲校之王和霖，趙金年，富社之葉世長，榮春社之徐榮奎等，戲路大都宗馬，在平均已薄負聲譽，恐不久悉將次第來滬獻藝也。</p>
<h3>「中國白雪公主」　昨日起開始攝製</h3>
<p>— 稜白</p>
<p>本年春天，童星陳娟娟從南洋遼遠地回到上海，以她往昔光榮的歷史，立刻就應聘國聯公司，本來，預定為她攝製的第一部片子是「中國白雪公主，」由吳永剛担任編導的工作。但是正要開拍，電影圈中，突然高漲起民間片競爭的風潮，於楚「中國白雪公主」暫緩攝製，吳永剛導演了「花魁女」一片，而陳娟娟却第一次披上古裝的外衣，在「杜十娘」中扮演了一個小妓女。</p>
<p>如今，民間片的風潮漸漸低壓，國聯當局，於是把攝製「中國白雪公主」的舊案重提了，好在編導者吳永剛，草稿業巳繕就，祇待實地開拍。</p>
<p>經過一星期的在服裝方面的縝密考據，巳經大體滿意。咋天，開始攝製第一塲的鏡頭，因為這是歌唱片，所以事前先由陳娟娟收了一支歌曲。</p>
<p>至於陣容方面，除陳娟娟的白雪公主外，晚娘一角，本定白虹担任，今因白虹要在「鐵扇公主」中演鐵扇公主的卡通模型的緣故，改由陸露明演；七個矮人，則仍由韓蘭根殷秀岑湯傑章志直洪警鈴葛福榮關宏達分任，可說包括了整個影壇的丑角。</p>
<p>據吳永剛說：其中許多地方，採用卡通片的誇張技巧，醫如一個噴嚏，門窗盡開，又如牆上的照片，看到憎惡的人物，照片上的笑容立刻會變成憤怒。總之，將使它成為不單有趣而且是饒有意義的童話喜劇。</p>

<h3>孔夫子影片人物考（三）</h3>
<p>— 天野繪　靑鳥撰</p>
<p>復聖顏回，魯人，字子淵，少孔子三十歲，以德行著聞。舉一知十，樂道安貧，世皆稱其仁。夫子畢生行仁義之道，「為大下者不顧家，」不辭險阻，不避艱苦，回也步趨追隨，不離左右，雖誼屬師生，而情同父子。回聰穎勤奮，弟子中無出其右，二十九歲而髮白，三十二歲卽早夭，夫干哭之慟，頻呼：「天喪予！天喪予！」其悲可知也。</p>

<h3>前奏　越劇二十種</h3>
<p>「彈詞二十種」有不少嗜痂的讀者，使作者非常感奮！「越劇一雖是種「地方戲」，但在近年來的上海，差不多已家絃戶誦，風靡一時。</p>
<p>無錢電播送越劇時，女孩子們都會情不自禁地曼聲學唱。作者有一位同居的小姐，原籍蘇州，生長上海；照理應該與「越劇」無緣，偏偏她愛聽愛唱。婉轉度曲，儼然越國女兒；登塲客串，不啻「一娟三花」。越劇之普遍，可以想見。</p>
<p>越劇雖極通俗，但並不通俗得可厭。劇詞中不乏天籟好句，而為自命高雅的詩人們撚斷吟髭所不能道者。</p>
<p>「彈詞」不止二十種，「越劇」當然更不止二十種；這裏不過擷舉其比較著名的一部份而已。</p>
<p>「彈詞二十種」是每種一圖的，本篇則每兩種選繪一圖；每星期刋兩種，全篇可在十個星期內刊全。</p>

<h3>說書與戲劇</h3>
<p>— 尹羊</p>
<p>伶人·票友·値得注意</p>
<p>說書和戲劇，本來無多大關聯，但同一為搬演故事，把上下數千年可歌可泣的事蹟來表現在聽衆眼前，其使命却似乎可以說是「殊途同歸」，所不同者，其表演方式「說書用嘴，唱戲用腿」而已。</p>
<p>「說書的嘴，唱戲的腿」，都具有一種神秘的力量，說書者無論是評話或彈詞，叙述書中事跡，憑一張嘴，運用其生花妙舌，曲折傳達，有條不紊，唱戲的仗着兩條腿搬動情節，咫尺之間，時而宮殿衙門，時而高山流水，同樣的可以令觀衆在聽到叙述，看到表現以後，一目了然其複雜情境的。</p>
<p>於是，我們知道說書與唱戲在無可聯系之中，有時也大可聲氣相通，評話家在書檯上起脚色，一般的要裝模作樣；彈詞家在書檯上表演小動作，一般的要耍腔玩態，形容喜怒哀樂；用之於說書的固可以若合符節，施諸於唱戲，其實也未始不能吻合無間。因此巳往各伶如叫天，小樓，有時也逗留在書塲中觀摹神情，說書名家如趙鶴卿，葉聲揚輩，也不時置身在歌台曲苑之中揣摩工架，昔年天蟾舞台排演封神榜，會聘說書者開講其精采處，卽以說書的妙處，移諸於舞台之上，而說書者亦曾以彈詞劇本，彩串於舞台之上，也得由伶人排演身段，說書和唱戲間的可以融會貫通，由此可知。</p>
<p>因此，筆者覺得說書與唱戲，彼此間大可互相切磋，息影家園的余叔岩，近來滬上的高慶奎，對於說書均感有絕大興趣。「他山之石，可以攻錯」。一個名家的得到成功，觸類旁通，正也大有助力呢。</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Concentrates in Pingxiang and Zhennanguan, Chinese Side Plans Containment and Harassment, Some Japanese Residents in Hanoi Begin Evacuation to Haiphong, Japanese Delegation Members Publicly Issue Threats, Report Franco-Japanese Agreement About to Be Signed</h3>
<p>According to news from Guangxi arriving in Hong Kong, the Japanese troops who were dispatched from North and Central China to Longzhou and Zhennanguan in southwestern Guangxi Province have arrived in Qinzhou, the southwestern coastal area of Guangdong Province, this week. The total military force of the Japanese army stationed in Guangxi Province has reached three divisions, preparing for action in Vietnam. Because the Japanese army is concentrated in Vietnam, the construction of the highway from Qinzhou to Nanning has been abandoned by the Chinese side. It is reported that this route, starting from the coast, has already completed sixty miles of railway. More than 2,000 workers, it is said, have been sent to Hainan Island to be trained into an army. A large number of Japanese troops are now concentrated in Zhennanguan and Pingxiang on the Vietnamese border. New-style defensive works have been built in Longzhou to prevent the Chinese army from attacking from the north. The Chinese side claims that the commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet in South China is currently in Tokyo Bay, which shows that the Japanese navy intends to assist the army's southward policy. The landing Japanese troops who participated in the Shanghai, Jiujiang, and Dongting Lake battles are now preparing for action in Huizhou and Hainan Island. The occupied areas of Guangxi are now guarded by the Taiwan Army and the Manchurian Army, and the regular Japanese army plans to use them to attack Vietnam. It is reported that the regular Chinese army and mobile units are harassing the isolated Japanese troops in the Nanning area. (International News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Since Japanese officials expressed dissatisfaction with the Franco-Japanese negotiations being conducted here, the majority of Japanese residents living in Hanoi have begun to evacuate from here yesterday, heading to Haiphong. This informal evacuation is clearly influenced by the attitude expressed by Japanese officials. At the same time, eight low-ranking members of the Japanese military delegation also flew from here to Guangzhou yesterday. As of last night, officials from both France and Japan did not want to comment on the extent to which the negotiations on Japan's demands on Annam had progressed. Japanese officials have not yet ordered the Japanese residents in Annam to evacuate, but according to the local Japanese consul yesterday, this order is expected to be issued in the near future, perhaps within a few days. Japanese officials here have attempted to increase pressure on France. A reporter said yesterday, "Japan is extremely tired of negotiations at the conference table..." Members of the Japanese delegation recently made public threats, saying that after General Tominaga returns from Tokyo, Japan plans to take even tougher steps to deal with Annam or will present a new ultimatum. It is reported that General Tominaga is one of the Japanese representatives who returned to Tokyo last week to receive new instructions. (Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The Japanese Consul General here, Sadaki, recently predicted that the Franco-Japanese agreement could be signed as early as tomorrow. Sadaki made this statement when talking to a reporter from the Associated Press after the evacuation of Japanese residents from Haiphong and eight members of the Japanese delegation flying away, which suddenly made the situation in Hanoi tense. Sadaki said that all issues have been resolved suddenly, and unless unexpected circumstances occur, the negotiations can definitely be concluded tomorrow. Although Sadaki said that the negotiations could be resolved immediately, he admitted that he had planned to evacuate Japanese women and children to Haiphong, where Japanese ships were waiting to load and evacuate the Japanese women and children. However, he continued that this action was purely a kind of precautionary plan. Furthermore, some Hanoi bank officials said that the Japanese deposits in various banks have already been withdrawn. While French officials refused to comment on reports that Thailand had demanded Vietnam cede territories formerly belonging to Thailand, news that Thai troops were concentrated near Poipet has been confirmed. Reliable sources said that the French army here absolutely wants to unite with the Japanese, but has no intention of helping Japan attack China. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>London: Dominion Affairs Minister Bondjie stated in the House of Lords yesterday that he had no definite information on the progress of the negotiations between Vietnam and Japan in Hanoi. However, in view of the rumors that Japan is forcing the Vietnamese government to allow Japan to send troops through its territory and establish naval and air force bases, the U.S. government has clarified to the Japanese government its concern for maintaining the status quo in the area. The British government has been actively considering the equipment and gasoline needed for distributing medicines in inland China and hopes to put forward definite proposals to the Japanese side soon. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suma met with reporters today, saying that the situation in Vietnam has not changed, and there is still considerable hope for permission to pass through the territory. Suma said, "We hope that the Franco-Japanese meeting will continue to be held," and added that Thailand's territorial demands on Vietnam have not actually affected the Franco-Japanese meeting in Hanoi, and the Japanese government is not aware of Thailand's intentions. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese news reports transmitted here from Hanoi today, British agents recently attempted to sabotage the Franco-Japanese negotiations in Hanoi, intending to prevent Japan from achieving its goals in Annam. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported, "The destructive tricks used by the British are to instigate the French authorities in Annam to violate the Vichy government's orders. The intention of these agents is to 'expand British influence,' and the Japanese side's purpose is only to pay close attention to their activities..." Furthermore, Japanese officials' deep dissatisfaction with the Franco-Japanese negotiations in Hanoi is also due to this reason. Furthermore, the Japanese news media today generally believes that the reason for the slow progress of the negotiations is also due to British interference. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Yunnan Agencies Ordered to Withdraw to Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao's editorial today stated that the situation in Vietnam is still extremely chaotic. The central government agencies in Yunnan Province have now been ordered to withdraw to Sichuan Province. The Ministry of Education has ordered the national universities and other schools in Yunnan Province to move to Sichuan Province. Yunnan University will move to Guizhou Province. The Vietnam Railway will open international special trains on September 16th to evacuate foreigners. Only the families of French railway personnel remain. It is said that no other foreigners remain in Kunming. It is still quiet, but the authorities are now evacuating residents to the countryside. It is also said that Nishihara has received new orders from Tokyo to continue negotiations with the Vietnamese authorities. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable sources said that the central government agencies and national schools in Kunming are prepared to move to Sichuan. This move is obviously to prevent Japanese air raids after Japan obtains air bases in Vietnam. Furthermore, the Yunnan authorities are also prepared to evacuate the residents of major cities to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>French Claim to Have Signed Non-Aggression Treaty with Thailand, Establishing Joint Arbitration Committee, To Take Effect After Exchange of Documents, Japan Claims Thai Troops Concentrated on Vietnamese Border, French Deny Thai Made Demands</h3>
<p>Vichy: France signed a treaty of non-aggression with Thailand on June 12. They decided to negotiate various outstanding issues between the two countries. One of the more important of these was the issue of the demarcation of the border between French-controlled Vietnam and Thailand along the Mekong River. This matter will be discussed by a joint arbitration committee organized by the two countries. Once the aforementioned treaty has been approved by both parties, this committee will start work in the Thai capital to discuss the demarcation. The French government sent the ratification documents by plane to the Thai capital today. Once the documents have been exchanged, this treaty will take effect. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to semi-official news from Saigon, after the implementation of the French-Thai non-aggression treaty, the demarcation of the border between Vietnam and Thailand in the Mekong River area will be submitted to the Bangkok Joint Committee for handling. The French version of the French-Thai non-aggression treaty has been sent to Bangkok by plane. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: French officials solemnly denied the American news agency's report that Thailand (Siam) had formally requested France to cede territory in Vietnam, stressing that France had never considered this issue. Well-informed sources pointed out that France and Thailand concluded a non-aggression pact on June 12, 1940, which will formally take effect once the exchange of ratification documents has taken place. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The French government announced last night that the non-aggression treaty concluded between the French government and Thailand in Tours on June 12 will take effect within a few days. Japanese news from Bangkok said that Thailand has made three important territorial demands on Vietnam. At this time, the Vichy government followed up with this news, from which the relationship between France and Thailand can be seen. French officials here said that this newly signed non-aggression treaty stipulates that the long-standing dispute over the ownership of some islands in the Mekong River, which are located at the border between Vietnam and Thailand, will be resolved by arbitration. French officials said that some major nationalist elements in Siam have taken advantage of the Franco-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam to demand the return of land that belonged to Thailand in 1893. The French Foreign Ministry formally announced last night that it had notified the Thai government that France would absolutely refuse to consider any demands for territorial concessions. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese reports from Bangkok, Siam, Thailand has concentrated a large army along the Annam border, and as a result of Thailand's territorial demands on Annam, the overall situation has suddenly become tense. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reports from Bangkok, Thailand has scheduled an unprecedented large-scale army exercise this autumn. Domestic troop movements are extremely busy. Being in that environment, one feels as if a war is about to break out. It is a closely guarded secret how many armed forces Thailand has nationwide. However, most of the troops have obviously been transferred to the Vietnamese border and other places. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Totalitarian Systems and the Future of the World</h3>
<p>One hundred and forty years ago, democracy in France was just beginning to emerge. Napoleon once swept across the entire European continent with his invincible army, and the tenets of the French Revolution, along with his military might, overthrew feudal systems everywhere. The Napoleonic Code, embodying the spirit of the French Revolution, established democratic republics modeled on the French political system in places like the Netherlands and Lombardy. At that time, it seemed universally acknowledged that the French-style democratic political system was the most reasonable system in history, capable of enduring for a long time without change. However, over a century of evolution and transition has fully demonstrated the cruelty of history. The position once held by Napoleon has now been replaced by Hitler, sweeping across Europe and even the world, and the political system seems no longer to be democracy, but totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Long before the outbreak of this European war, some countries, in order to cope with internal and external difficulties, were more or less imitating the systems of totalitarian countries. On the eve of the European war, only a few countries in Northern and Western Europe still maintained the tradition of democracy. As the war swept across Northern Europe, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium were successively swallowed up by the Nazis, and France ended its 150 years of glorious history in defeat. Of the three remaining democracies in Europe, Britain was trapped in a final life-or-death struggle, Sweden was squeezed between the two great powers of the Soviet Union and Germany, and as for Switzerland, although its democratic system had a long history of honor in Europe, it recently caused political turmoil due to the expansion of the National Socialist Party's influence. In addition, countries such as Romania had already become monarchical dictatorships before this, and since the division of its territory and the forced abdication of Carol, Antonescu's regime has been closely following the facilities of totalitarianism. Therefore, in terms of today's European situation, the threat of totalitarianism has reached its peak, while the democratic system has encountered a serious crisis unprecedented in 150 years. Outside of Europe, in the Americas, except for countries like the United States, Mexico, Chile, and Argentina, some Latin American countries are gradually moving from democracy towards totalitarianism. In Japan, the fascist movement that has been brewing for many years has also reached its realization with Konoe's new political system. Although Mussolini once said: "Fascism is not an export product," totalitarian political systems have continued to be transplanted to other countries with the expansion of the Axis powers. If Germany and Italy gain an advantage in the European war, this trend will undoubtedly develop further.</p>
<p>Here, I do not want to criticize the strengths and weaknesses of democracy and totalitarianism, nor am I prepared to judge whether the above trends are progressive or reactionary. What I am concerned about is only what impact the temporary popularity of totalitarian systems will have on the future international situation? Can it stabilize international relations in turmoil and hostility? Of course, this question can only be answered accurately after the European war is decided. Let us now try to predict the future trend based on the totalitarian system itself.</p>
<p>Totalitarian regimes contain two basic elements: extreme nationalism and strict internal control. The reason why some people in Germany and Italy are willing to endure hardship and bitterness to support the government's strict control is none other than the fact that the Nazis and Fascists both advocated external liberation from restraints or the establishment of great achievements, which can arouse people's aspirations and gain their support. At the same time, this is also the main reason why totalitarian countries must constantly engage in external expansion or aggression. Moreover, in terms of the motivation to lean towards totalitarian systems, they can be divided into two types: one is the instigation of the Fifth Column, and the other is the envy of the achievements of Germany and Italy. Among the countries in Europe that have changed their political systems, some are naturally the result of internal and external coercion, but the vast majority are still striving to learn from and imitate the achievements of Germany and Italy, attempting to achieve similar achievements by changing the political system. For example, with the reform of France and Romania, it is difficult to believe that their current authorities are just willingly acting as vassals of the Axis powers without seeking the restoration and revival of their countries. Therefore, in these countries, they would not fail to emphasize their nationalistic stance. However, if this trend continues to develop, it will inevitably form a resistance to the Axis powers' domination of Europe and be contrary to the desires of Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Nazis and Fascists are both anti-internationalist. The so-called Fascist international is just a castle in the air: and Hitler's planned European Federation takes Germany as its leader. If Hitler's plan is realized, the sovereignty of every country in Europe must be abolished: at the very least, it must strive to reduce the sovereignty of each country and place it entirely under Nazi control. Even if Germany hopes that all the countries it dominates will be Nazified in terms of their political systems, that must also be one-sided: only strengthening internal control and eliminating the nationalistic elements, because if this is not the case, there is no way to form German domination. This approach is certainly not what those countries that have adopted totalitarian political systems are willing to do, and that attempt to learn from and imitate the achievements of Germany and Italy is also not what the Axis powers want to hear. If that attempt can be successfully achieved, what will be formed will inevitably be an opponent of the Axis powers rather than its vassal. Even with regard to Germany and Italy themselves, if there were not still a common enemy existing to this day, then whether they could live together peacefully for a long time is a major question. And the totalitarian political system itself only has special effects in the process of preparing for war.</p>
<p>Napoleon's expedition once promoted the development of national consciousness in various countries, and similarly, Hitler's expansion today will inevitably lead to the rise of nationalism in various countries; however, the achievements of totalitarianism may not be comparable to those of democracy. Because the democratic system has protected individual rights and freedoms and has brought order and peace to this world—even if it is not thorough; however, what comes with totalitarianism is only domination and expansion. The popularity of totalitarian political systems around the world only suggests greater opposition and contradictions in the future, unless the Axis powers' military victory can completely eliminate the nationalism or statism of other countries, or a considerable stability can be formed, but this is unimaginable, and this situation is enough to prove that Mussolini's saying that "Fascism is not an export product" does contain considerable truth.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Southeastern Shanxi Completely Surrounds Gaoping, All Highways Have Been Cut Off One After Another, Japanese Army in Jincheng Fails to Break Through</h3>

<h3>Lin Yutang Suggests US Aid China with Aircraft</h3>
<p>Honolulu: Dr. Lin Yutang, a famous Chinese philosopher and writer, arrived here yesterday from Manila. Today he issued a suggestion, saying, "Instead of building a large two-ocean navy, the United States should lend or donate the cost of two battleships to China, so that China can use this money to purchase a large squadron of American high-speed fighter planes. If this can be done, China can keep Japan busy for several more years, exhausting its financial resources to the point of collapse, and the United States can sleep peacefully without worrying about Pacific defenses." Mr. Lin told a United Press reporter that he visited Chongqing for three days and saw that the people's morale was good. Although all the troops lacked heavy weapons, their appearance was also excellent. Moreover, western China has abundant food supplies. Although Japanese planes bombing Chongqing aim to weaken the people's hearts, they actually strengthen public opinion. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>United States Expands West Hemisphere Coastal Bases on Large Scale; Naval Department Sends Eight-Person Committee to Conduct Design; Thirty Warships to Immediately Return to Hawaiian Islands</h3>
<p>Washington: In order to strengthen the existing coastal bases in the Western Hemisphere so that they can support its planned two-ocean fleet, the U.S. Navy Department today specially appointed an eight-person committee to make detailed designs for a large-scale expansion of American coastal defense structures. Navy Secretary Knox instructed the committee to convene as soon as possible and revise the 1938 Hepburn Report to modernize it. The Hepburn Report has always been the standard policy of the United States for coastal bases. Acting Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said, "The military effectiveness of the Navy, including naval aviation, almost entirely depends on whether there are sufficient and appropriate coastal bases. This is a tried and tested principle, so the establishment of this committee is motivated by this." Forrestal also said that in accordance with the recently passed expansion plan, the fleet will increase by 70 percent, and naval bases should be increased proportionally. It is said that this new committee will also study the bases recently obtained from the United Kingdom. Although the committee's research is said to be limited to bases in the Western Hemisphere, other locations such as Cavite in the Philippines may also be included. The director is Rear Admiral Greenslade. The committee was also ordered to study and introduce shipbuilding plans, as well as various facilities for naval artillery, radio equipment, research laboratories, and naval aviation hospitals. In addition, naval personnel must also be studied. (International dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>San Diego: Navy Secretary Knox, last night declared here that the expansion of the U.S. naval base in the Pacific has been far faster than the originally planned, and was also satisfied with the recent strengthening of the Panama Canal defenses. He stated, "Any foreign battleship entering within range of our 14-inch or 18-inch guns on the Panama Canal side can only beg for divine protection. In the Canal Zone, the best weapon against aircraft is also aircraft, and we have already made rapid preparations." Secretary Knox also declared that 30 battleships sailed from Honolulu yesterday to return to headquarters so that sailors who have not taken a vacation for a long time can rest. He predicted that the fleet will soon return to Hawaii completely intact. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>San Diego: Thirty small U.S. warships anchored at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu set sail yesterday to return to the mainland naval ports for repairs.

<h3>US States Begin Conscription; Roosevelt Explains Meaning of Conscription</h3>
<p>Washington: State governments and the federal government in the United States have today begun engaging in unprecedented conscription in American history. Staff in each state capital have today begun preparing to increase America's manpower in accordance with a plan that was gradually developed years ago. By October 16, all Americans between the ages of 21 and 35 will be registered. This is the first step in conscripting 400,000 people in mid-October. At the same time, 35,600 newly added National Guardsmen have been ordered to report and will join the previous 60,500 to serve on October 1. The detailed affairs of conscription will be handled by 6,500 conscription bureaus across the country. Each bureau will decide which people should be conscripted and which people should be exempted. Approximately 75,000 people may be assigned to trained regular army and National Guard units. President Roosevelt delivered a speech when signing the Conscription Act, stating that the United States has now adopted peacetime conscription, and this move will expand the basic concept of citizenship. In addition to the original ideas of equality of rights, equality of privileges, and equality of opportunity in the democratic political ideal, we now set the grain of equal conscription as a kind of responsibility and obligation. Our preparation for this kind of national defense has not departed from the track of our country's democratic system history, but reaffirms the inherent and generally recognized principles of democratic government. The militia system, which imposes military service obligations on every freeman, has long been based in Soviet law. It was set by our country's founders. When this continent was not yet a colony, it was a recognized system. When the Federal Constitution was established, nine of the thirteen states incorporated this universal conscription system into basic law. At that time, not many people had to engage in the equipment and training of soldiers, but every American had a flintlock gun and knew how to use it, and all were strong and healthy and accustomed to hard work. When reporting for military service, everyone carried a Mauser rifle and gunpowder, and their daily lives had made them accustomed to tactics. However, today's wars require various special weapons. In addition, behind the armed forces, we need a military industry to become a part of the economic organization, so that we can supply the fighters with complete weapons and equipment. Therefore, many people engaged in production work can also serve the country from the production aspect. The purpose of conscription is to provide the army and navy with people, and at the same time strive to avoid affecting daily life. The president continued to state the general meaning of the four conscription steps of registration, classification, selection, and enlistment, and said that ordinary conscription is not only a preparation to cope with the threat of war, but also sufficient to make people realize why they can enjoy peace and happiness.

<h3>Germany Claims to Have Used "Super Cannon" to Bomb Central London Yesterday; Ships Encountered Storm and Suffered Fierce Air Raids; Major Blow to Germany's Invasion of England Plan</h3>
<p>London: According to news received from neutral countries, the rumor that the giant cannon on the coast of France and Belgium may bombard London came from German military circles in Berlin. It has been solemnly declared here that we do not know of any German long-range shells that have fallen on London. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Military circles here claim that German artillery units on the European continent fired cannon shells weighing one ton last night, flying across the English Channel and reaching the center of London, ninety miles away. It is said that this type of cannon is a new type of "super cannon" that has never been used on the battlefield. The test results were good last night, and the shells all followed a high-arc trajectory, crossing the Channel to London. This proves that the Germans' tactics can be called unique. Officials said that things that will startle the British will come one after another. The attack of this long-range cannon is only the beginning. Reliable sources, in order to support this prediction, initially asserted the possibility of an invasion of England. Furthermore, according to official announcements, German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder is inspecting the French coast. The publication of this matter coincides with Army Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch inspecting the army and Air Force General Göring surveying London, so its significance is very important. The test of the German new-style cannon this time was extremely secretive in advance. When the news was first released, people here were also frightened. Experts believe that the altitude of the trajectory is at least one mile above the ground when the firing point is so far from the target. According to the last war, the cannon used by the Germans to attack Paris had a range of 70 miles. The cannon disappeared at the end of the war, and its manufacturing method was also cheated away by others. The current new-style cannon is newly started by us, and cannot be known. According to officials, the shelling of London is currently only an occasional occurrence, but the rate of fire will soon increase. The authorities said that the importance of this artillery battle lies not in the actual destruction, but in its effect of thwarting the enemy's spirit. (International News Service dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: This morning, British fighters and German planes suddenly encountered each other in a hurricane with a speed of 100 miles per hour, and engaged in a fierce battle in the sky 25,000 feet above the mouth of the Thames. At the same time, the German Navy is also fighting against a storm of 50 miles per hour. It is said that one German warship has been blown off the sea surface by the storm. According to British sources, the German army is now attempting to restore order to its invasion fleet, which has been destroyed and scattered in various places. This is because the fleet was not only disrupted by unexpected weather, but was also severely damaged by the British Air Force. Observers here believe that these two disasters are exactly the same as the destruction of the Spanish Armada led by Sir Drake in 1588. The British Air Ministry said that most of the German fleet and hundreds of barges in the ports of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were scattered and destroyed by the hurricane. The whistling sound in the English Channel is still strong. It is said that when the British Air Force forced the remaining German invasion fleet to retreat inland, it severely damaged it. (International dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry announced that British bombers launched large-scale attacks on German ship concentrations, transportation lines in occupied areas, and several targets in Germany last night, which was very effective. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, the hurricane at sea reached a speed of 100 miles per hour. Today, the Dover Strait and the Gulf of Bohai are still very dangerous. There is slight fog at sea, and the German coast has been shrouded and cannot be seen. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: It has just been reported by a Norwegian that Hitler has changed his plan to attack England, because many Norwegian ships that were requisitioned were returned to their owners in the past few days. The Norwegian arrived here by plane from Stockholm and listed various activities carried out by the Germans on the Norwegian coast in the past two months to prepare for attacking England, even including training on how cavalry get on and off ships. Two weeks ago, when the German authorities returned the ships that had been requisitioned for the purpose of attacking England to their original owners, the ship owners and fishermen were surprised.

<p>Berlin: Haitong News Agency correspondent Chris Hsing was the first news reporter allowed to visit the German long-range artillery that bombed England. According to the discussion, the process is as follows: On the way to the artillery battery by car, I caught a glimpse of the quarters of the long-range artillery team. The disguise equipment was so perfect that it was impossible to identify it. Arriving at the artillery battery, I saw a long line of artillery pieces, the length of the artillery company, and the size of the caliber that I had never seen before. I dare say that this weapon, no matter what the climate or time, is a threat to London, and the threat is no less than that of the Air Force. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>From Last Night to Noon Yesterday, German Planes Madly Bombed London; Length of Time Unprecedented; Heavy Damage to Prosperous Business District</h3>
<p>London: German planes took turns bombing London last night and this morning, resulting in a wide range of bombed areas. The central area and the prosperous business district in the west end were affected. German planes attacked almost continuously from 8:06 PM last night to 6:00 AM this morning. The length of time was unprecedented. It is feared that the casualties of residents will be greater than in the most recent few times, because many people who took refuge in an underground railway station were hit by German bombs. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: Today, London issued its fifth air raid alert at 12:47 PM and canceled it at 2:27 PM. This is the 99th alert issued in London since the outbreak of the war. After fierce air battles, the German planes scattered and flew away and returned to escape. Today, several high-explosive bombs have fallen on a certain town at the mouth of the Thames River, causing considerable damage and making many residents homeless. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: According to today's news, the famous London's Whitechapel Market has been bombed in a recent air raid. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: According to an Air Ministry communique, by midnight last night, 12 German bombers had been shot down in various places by German planes that raided England. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: When German planes attacked last night, the momentum in the first few hours was far less fierce than in the previous three days, with only single planes or small groups flying in. At 7:09 PM (4:09 AM Shanghai summer time this morning), London issued its fifth alarm. More than three hours had passed, but the alarm had not been cancelled. As soon as the alarm was issued, enemy planes broke into the central area of London, but were quickly shot down by intense anti-aircraft fire and searched by searchlights, which have been very active in the past six days. Yesterday at 1:50 PM, London issued a third alarm and cancelled the alarm at 3:26 PM. The fourth alarm was issued at 5:34 PM. Damage was sustained in places such as Berkeley Square and Oxford Street. Yesterday morning, London citizens watched the battle from the buildings on Fleet Street, seeing German planes trying to avoid British fighter planes through the clouds, but were finally hit by machine gun bullets. The pilot jumped out with a parachute. The sight was quite thrilling when the aerial combat was in full swing. Yesterday afternoon, British and German fighter planes also fought in the air above Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and the mouth of the Thames River in a gale of 100 miles per hour. According to the Air Ministry Intelligence Office, after the German bomber squadron was shattered in the London air battle on Sunday, the Germans yesterday sent more than 200 Messerschmitt and Heinkel fighter planes across the Channel to England. Although British planes were hampered by dense clouds when searching for enemy planes, they were still able to destroy four enemy planes, and the anti-aircraft guns on the southeast coast also shot down two enemy planes.

<h3>Italian Army Continues to Advance into Egypt in Three Routes; Rumor That Sidi Barrani Has Been Occupied; 100,000 British Troops Defend the First Line</h3>
<p>Rome: The Italian army and Libyan troops in North Africa are advancing victoriously and have occupied Sidi Barrani, 100 kilometers from the Cyrenaica border. Our army will immediately use this place as an offensive base. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to an Italian report last night, the Italian army that invaded Egypt on Saturday has now reached Sidi Barrani, 65 miles inside Egypt. After the Italian army occupies the area, it can utilize well water and military airfields, which is very helpful for the progress of the military. At the same time, it is said that more than 100,000 British troops have been deployed to Marsa Matruh (transliteration), which is an important railway stronghold, located 30 miles east of Sidi Barrani. The British army seems to intend to use it as the first line of defense against the Italian invasion. The total Italian military strength is about 500,000 people. It is heard that they are advancing on Alexandria in three routes. The first route of Italian troops has joined another army along the coast from Salum and Buq Buq. It is said that they occupied Barrani yesterday. The second route of the Italian army cut off a circular ground 50 miles from the coast. The third route of the Italian army is said to be taking another route, progressing in an area 200 miles from the coast. The atmosphere here is very optimistic, and it seems that victory in the war against Egypt can be expected. The Italian army stationed in Egypt and all the British troops there are in a ratio of five to one. The Italian side claims that its air force strength exceeds that of the United Kingdom by five times. At present, the Italian side is busy consolidating its positions and all reinforcements, etc. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>Spain to Strengthen Ties with the Axis Powers; Sunner Holds Important Talks in Germany and Will Proceed to Rome to Meet the Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Berlin - Spanish Interior Minister Sunner, one hour after visiting Hitler at 11:30 yesterday morning, immediately proceeded to visit German Interior Minister Dr. Frick. At 1:00 PM, he met with Police Chief Himmler. At 2:00 PM, the German Interior Minister hosted a banquet for Sunner. At 8:30 PM, the Spanish Embassy also held a grand banquet, inviting important German figures to accompany him. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Spanish Interior Minister Sunner's visit to Berlin may facilitate closer relations between Spain and the Berlin Axis today. Sunner is the brother-in-law of General Franco. Yesterday, he held important meetings with Hitler, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and other high-ranking German officials. German sources say that Sunner's visit to Berlin coincides with Germany's large-scale air raids on Britain and Italy's invasion of Egypt, which has "extremely significant political implications." It is generally believed here that, as General Franco's trusted representative, Sunner must have informed the German government of a complete report on Spain's current pro-Axis, non-belligerent policy. It is believed that he also outlined Franco's intention to achieve any peaceful resolution mandated by Berlin or Rome. German newspapers said yesterday that the return of Gibraltar to Spain is the main point of Spanish policy. (United Press telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome - Spanish Interior Minister Sunner will arrive here this week to meet with Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. Italian newspapers said yesterday that Sunner's visit to Berlin and Rome may be related to Spain's upcoming participation in the new Mediterranean order planned by the Rome-Berlin Axis. Diplomatic circles here believe that Spain will soon hear about the war against Britain. However, they point out that Sunner's trip to Rome and Berlin will undoubtedly strengthen ties between Spain and the Axis powers. Foreign diplomats analyze that although Spain will not immediately join the war, if Germany's aerial blitzkrieg against Britain is successful, then Spain's occupation of Gibraltar is inevitable.

<h3>European War Talks (9) - The Inside Story of France's Surrender</h3>
<p>This article is a report from the European correspondents of the New York Herald Tribune and the former Paris correspondent of the British Manchester Guardian. Translated and recorded separately below:</p>
<p>France's defeat this time is unprecedented in the country's history, or even rare in all war history. The German army attacked for only six weeks, and the French army immediately had to appeal for an armistice. This defeat was even more tragic than the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Although French King Napoleon III surrendered his power to William I, and General Bazaine surrendered his army, the Paris garrison was still able to hold out for several months and hastily reorganize. Before admitting defeat, the French army was still able to strike the German army repeatedly.</p>
<p>But in this war, although the French army fought bravely, it never achieved a single victory. Since the German army launched its offensive on May 10, and after Sedan approached the Meuse River, the French army suffered successive defeats, and finally fell completely, beyond recovery.</p>
<p>The French army, with 3 million officers and soldiers, was known as the best army in Europe before the war. Why did it fall to this extreme? General Pétain, the French Prime Minister, made a broadcast speech, clarifying that the French army's defeat was due to insufficient military equipment, too few soldiers, and insufficient British assistance. The German army had six times as many planes as the Allied forces. The number of French troops was 500,000 fewer than in 1917. The British army had only ten divisions on the front line, while in 1917, there were eighty-five British divisions on the front line. During the last war, the French side also had 58 Italian divisions and 42 American divisions to help, but this time Italy was at war with France, and the United States maintained neutrality.</p>
<p>The reduction of French manpower and material resources is undoubtedly a serious obstacle. But more important is the strong morale and skilled command of the German army. The German authorities understood the importance of tanks, armored vehicles, and mechanized units in modern warfare, and developed them to the highest limit. The German side expected that these weapons would be sufficient to carry out mobile warfare, but the French General Staff still adhered to the inexhaustible trench warfare.</p>
<p>What is gratifying is that some young French generals had already expected that this war would inevitably adopt mobile warfare tactics. General de Gaulle, the current head of the French National Committee in London, is one of them. In 1934, he wrote a book elaborating that motorized units could operate independently behind enemy lines, destroying bridges and ammunition depots, without having to worry about the communication lines of their own troops.</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Reynaud was quite moved by de Gaulle's opinion, and in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies, he advocated the heavy use of motorized units. Unfortunately, the inflexible authorities in the French army did not believe it. Even the situation of the German army's operations in Poland failed to make them wake up, and they continued to rely on the Maginot Line, thinking that holding this cement and steel wall could make up for the lack of manpower and weapons. Unfortunately, the Maginot Line was only built to the Luxembourg border, not along the Belgian border directly to the English Channel.</p>
<p>Therefore, the German army was able to break through the French positions at Sedan, and attack the back of the Maginot Line. The breakthrough of the positions there was the key to the subsequent French defeat. The French side adhered to the strategy of the last war from the beginning, believing that the main force of the German army would still advance through Belgium, so when the German army began to attack the Netherlands and Belgium, they sent the most elite mechanized divisions, nine divisions, and all the British army to meet them.</p>
<p>But the German strategy was different from the campaign of 1914, and they launched a fierce attack on the Ardennes forest area with their main force. The French garrison was led by General Corap, with inferior troops and no reserves for reinforcement. After the German army broke Corap's army, they could directly take Paris. The reason why they did not immediately occupy Paris was to cut off the Allied forces in Flanders.</p>
<p>The French side apparently believed that the Meuse River and the Ardennes Forest were both natural barriers, and the German army could not possibly attack, so the defenses were weak. Unexpectedly, the German army launched an offensive in that direction, beyond the expectations of the French.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the defenses of Dunkirk were strong, and the main force of the British army and most of the French army were able to safely evacuate from Flanders. The best equipment was lost. Later, the German side moved its troops directly to Paris. Although the French army fought bravely, they could not resist the German tank assaults.</p>
<p>By June 16, the French cabinet convened an emergency meeting in Bordeaux. Prime Minister Reynaud advocated that the only way out for France was to continue fighting together with Britain. British military equipment was becoming more and more abundant, and a large number of tanks and aircraft could be transported from the United States. The French navy was still the second largest in Europe, and should continue to blockade with the British fleet to strangle Germany.</p>
<p>However, the cabinet members who hoped to fight to the end, such as Prime Minister Reynaud and Colonial Minister Mandel, were opposed by most of the cabinet members who sought peace at any cost. The two old men, General Pétain (84 years old) and General Weygand (73 years old), decided the overall situation with one word. The two old men said that continuing to fight would only shed blood in vain, and would have little effect. According to the Petit Parisien, former Prime Minister Laval (now Deputy Prime Minister) criticized Reynaud's proposal to go to North Africa to fight, saying, "How can abandoning the country save the country?" This remark truly represents the opinion of most cabinet members.</p>
<p>Below is a report from the former Paris correspondent of the Manchester Guardian:</p>
<p>The beginning and end of France's begging for peace will be recorded by historians in the future. At present, it is still difficult to say exactly who is to blame for France's surrender. However, according to the fragmentary information obtained by the reporter in Bordeaux, and after examining the Pétain government and its entourage, it is possible to get a rough answer to why France surrendered.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that France's surrender was the result of a small group of military and political figures betraying the French people. The question is what those people hoped for when they decided to stop fighting. Now that the armistice conditions have been accepted, what makes people even more puzzled is that the Pétain government and its entourage must have hoped for more than this, but they still accepted these shocking conditions. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Rumors that France would make a separate peace had been secretly spread in France for a long time. I still remember that on the day Prime Minister Reynaud delivered his famous speech in the Senate, announcing the fall of Arras and Amiens, someone spread rumors that President Lebrun strongly supported a separate peace.</p>
<p>In the week that followed, everyone's attention was focused on the Dunkirk war. It was not until the second week of June that the German army launched a general offensive against Paris. On June 8, there was still an optimistic atmosphere in the French Ministry of the Army. They seemed surprised that the "Weygand Line" could hold for two days. Later, the German army broke through the Meuse River and rushed straight to the ports of the English Channel like a broken bamboo, and France's confidence must have declined. As expected, the optimistic atmosphere changed to a gloomy scene the next day. Official spokesman Colonel Thomas said that this was a "decisive day," and that the German army attacking France had a total of 100 divisions.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the residents of Paris fled to other places one after another, and the gloomy atmosphere became even deeper. Although there were fierce battles in many places, the French troops in all places only retreated, and there were no reports of large-scale counterattacks. On June 13, Prime Minister Reynaud made a shocking statement in Tours, saying that even if France was left with only one province, they would fight even if they retreated to North Africa. He also appealed to US President Roosevelt, saying that France's strength to continue fighting depended on continuing to obtain foreign aid. The implication of this speech was that the French army's resistance at home had collapsed, and only the United States could prevent France from collapsing completely. This was obviously something that could not be done overnight. Some say that Reynaud's speech had already slightly revealed his intention to surrender, which had a very bad impact on the French army.</p>
<p>Reynaud was sincere, but he lacked the kind of courage that the "Tiger" Prime Minister Clemenceau had during the last war to inspire the people. He also lacked ruthless methods. Even if he appointed Mandel as Minister of the Interior, he only sought compromise in internal affairs. The selection of cabinet members was not good, which allowed his "pro-war" cabinet to feel bad forces from the beginning, and its pro-war will may not have been as firm as outsiders expected. Reynaud served concurrently as Minister of the Army and Foreign Affairs, Mandel served as Minister of the Interior, and the elderly Marin was extremely anti-German, which was true; however, some people, such as the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger and the Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office Baudouin, should not have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Reynaud's wartime cabinet included those who held pessimistic views, advocated pro-Italian views, were inclined to fascism, and the decadent faction who regarded themselves as "France's elders." Although Daladier, who was responsible for the collapse of France's border defenses, and Tormonzi, who admired Mussolini, had both left their posts, there were still many suspicious people in the Reynaud government, such as Frossard, Laval's friend, Houtin, the representative of the French rural pacifists, Baudouin, an unknown Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, and Provost, the publisher of the Paris Soir who was the Minister of Information. When the reporter was about to leave Paris, Provost entertained British journalists, and his remarks were mediocre and lacked confidence in Anglo-French cooperation. In addition, there was General Pétain and his loyal Ibarnégaray, who were all close friends of Spanish leader General Franco. Pétain was moved by Franco's words, hoping that Germany would offer France honorable armistice conditions, and believing that the two sides could conduct peace talks as soldiers.</p>
<p>By June 16, the French cabinet convened an emergency meeting in Bordeaux. Reynaud, Mandel, Marin, and Tauratli were still vigorously advocating continuing the war, but after the cabinet meeting, Reynaud had resigned, and the Pétain government was immediately established. Army Minister Weygand had apparently determined that France was unable to continue the war.</p>

<h3>The September 18th Incident Passed Peacefully; All Sectors in Shanghai Remain Calm and Determined; Willing to Emulate Churchill's Hard Work Spirit and Fulfill the National Duty to Fight for Justice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions, in order to ensure a safe passage, in addition to the full mobilization of the police, Chinese and Western detectives, the International Settlement Volunteers, and the Volunteer Corps, also sent letters in advance to the commanders of the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai, asking them to send teams to various districts to assist in defense. The area bordering the British and French concessions on Edward Road, which was not an important road, continued to be closed yesterday. Chinese and Western detectives stationed at the gaps were also increased. Inspections of pedestrians and vehicles were extremely strict. All entertainment venues in the city automatically closed. All levels of schools were also closed for one day to ensure the safety of students. All sectors of the city, because of the extraordinary times, expressed their cooperation with the authorities and took no action. However, while admiring Britain's hard fight for justice, they also secretly wished to emulate Churchill's spirit of hard work to fulfill the national duty of Chinese citizens. Therefore, under the strict defense of the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, the order within the boundaries was well maintained, and no unfortunate incidents occurred. The situation is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>All Concession Forces Mobilized</p>
<p>After the police authorities of the two concessions began severe precautions the night before, the situation yesterday became more tense. The search work at the gaps has been intensified. Several places within the boundaries have been searched by patrols and police. Armored vehicle patrols have also been very active. Yesterday, troops from various countries were mobilized. Fortresses on various roads were occupied by troops, closely monitoring all vehicles, patrolling in their respective defense zones, and assisting police in conducting searches. The International Settlement Volunteers also continued to be responsible for the security work in Zones B and D, but were not fully mobilized, except for the White Russian team and the two major teams A and B.</p>
<p>Five Bridges All Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the state of alert at the bridges along the Suzhou Creek included five bridges that were completely closed: Jiangxi Road Bridge, Shanxi Road Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, and Sampan Factory Bridge. Two U.S. troops were stationed at the northern ends of Wuzhen Road, Sampan Factory, and Xinzha Bridges, guarding with guns. The remaining Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Henan Road Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, and Yu Qiaqing Road Bridge were all open as usual. A large number of Chinese and Western detectives were added to the north and south ends by the police station to strictly search the objects of pedestrians, and the wire mesh frames were moved close to the center of the bridges, leaving channels in the middle for vehicles to come and go.</p>
<p>No Restrictions on Ships in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Severe precautions were also implemented in the Huangpu River yesterday. Patrol boats of the Water Police Station were all dispatched yesterday morning to patrol the Huangpu River and search suspicious ships. Japanese naval patrol ships also patrolled and searched from time to time. However, there were no restrictions on ships entering and exiting. Most of the wharves along the Huangpu River on the Bund were closed, except for a few places such as Roosevelt and the New Customs. Those that were open were also stationed with a large number of police detectives, closely guarded. Some wharves in Pudong, Yangshupu, Hongkou, and the upper reaches of the Suzhou Creek were also closed by the Japanese, leaving only important ones for entry and exit. The inspection there was also very strict.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai Border Covered with Iron Nets</p>
<p>The Public Concession authorities attached great importance to the defense of western Shanghai. Iron wire nets were placed at various intersections on roads bordering the "badlands," such as Connaught Road, Yanping Road, Rue Robert, Yanping Road Jiaozhou Road, Xinzha Road, Avenue Haig, and Route de Zikawei. A large number of Italian troops and detectives were stationed there to inspect pedestrians and vehicles very strictly. Because residents in the areas beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai were cautious, few went out, so the scenery was desolate. Japanese military police patrolled the area in formation yesterday and inspected pedestrians, and the situation was quite tense.</p>
<p>Special Precautions Continue to be Implemented</p>
<p>After safely passing September 18, the special precautionary measures of the authorities of the two concessions will continue to be implemented by the police authorities. Various vehicles and pedestrians will still be subject to strict searches. The wire mesh obstacles at various important intersections have not been removed, in order to eliminate all terrorist activities in accordance with the authorities' planned plan. The two concessions are very strict about the curfew, and will continue to do so in the future. At the same time, the atmosphere in the northern district of Suzhou Creek is quite calm and solemn, because the Japanese expatriates are holding a memorial service for Prince Shirakawa, who died in a plane crash in Mongolia. The nightclubs and entertainment venues opened by the Japanese in Hongkou were all closed on the two evenings before yesterday. However, the cafes opened by European expatriates were still open as usual.</p>
<p>Appropriate Precautions, Peaceful Passage</p>
<p>Because of the appropriate precautions taken by the police authorities of the two concessions, the day passed peacefully and uneventfully. However, a large number of slogans written in chalk were found on various roads such as Nanjing Road, Henan Road, Edward Road, Haining Road, Ningbo Road, and Avenue Joffre. Also, at about 8:00 p.m. yesterday, several youths in the Zhengjia Wood Bridge and French Garden area of the French Concession distributed commemorative leaflets and slogans with very progressive content. Also, the same leaflets were found in the Wing On Company's Grand Eastern Tea Room and the Sincere Company, etc., last night. The youth were also distributing this leaflet in various cars at the intersection of Nanking Road, and Chiao-ching Road.</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Because yesterday was a memorial day, and citizens throughout the city stopped entertaining, all public entertainment venues in the Public Concession and the French Concession declared a day off. Large theaters such as the Golden and Grand Stage, drama theaters such as the Rue Lafayette and Greater China, small theaters such as the Queen, Celestial Fragrance, Grand Lai, Old Gate, and Min Le, and entertainment venues such as the Great World, all announced a day off. Other Western cinemas were open as usual, but the audience were all foreigners.</p>
<p>"A" Company to Transfer Defense Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteers are undertaking defense duties in the Hongkou West District of the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession, adopting a rotation system. Its second rotation week will end tomorrow (the 19th) at 8:00 p.m. At that time, the Volunteers' B Company, which took over defense since Sunday evening last week, will be relieved by A Company. It is reported that B Company includes the American Company, the American Machine Gun Company, and the Portuguese Company. A Company has the largest number of members, so it will continue to defend for seven or eight days from tomorrow. The defense zone has been defended by the Volunteers since the British Army Seaforth Highlanders retreated, and it has been four weeks. It is still impossible to say how long the current temporary defense measures of the Volunteers will last. The authorities have not made any statements on this. However, judging from the situation, the current measures will not be changed for the time being. At the same time, there is still no news of the negotiations between the United States and Japan regarding the Shanghai defense zone. Therefore, the situation in the city will not change in the near future.</p>
<h3>Tragedy in the French Concession Concentration Camp; Chairman Chiang Attaches Great Importance; Has Ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Make a Serious Protest to France; Improve Treatment and Reserve the Right to Demand</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 18th - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek attaches great importance to the incident in which Vietnamese soldiers in the French Concession in Shanghai shot and killed Chinese soldiers. In addition to ordering an investigation into the truth, he also ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with France immediately. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the French side yesterday, asking to improve treatment first, guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again, and reserve all rights to demand.</p>
<h3>Xie Jinyuan's Sorrowful Report: One Soldier of the Isolated Battalion Killed; Tragedy Caused by Russian Guards Firing Guns; Another Soldier of the Isolated Battalion Seriously Wounded by Bullet; Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss, Further Discussion Pending</h3>
<p>Following a conflict between soldiers of the Isolated Battalion at the Jiaozhou Road Sihang Warehouse and Russian mercenaries stationed at the camp on the 14th, nearly a week has passed. Although the Isolated Battalion had submitted two requests to the Shanghai Municipal Council – to lift the blockade and restore freedom – these have not yet been resolved. Yesterday (the 18th), during a Board of Directors meeting, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing made an impromptu report on the conflict. However, due to the lack of detailed reports regarding casualties in the Isolated Battalion, confirmation was impossible. It is said that the discussion resulted in a decision to order Colonel Hembel, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, to submit a detailed report, after which another Board of Directors meeting would be convened to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>One Soldier of the Isolated Battalion Dies from Bullet Wound</p>
<p>Just as the conflict between the Isolated Battalion and the Russian mercenaries had not yet been resolved, reliable sources reported yesterday that a serious clash occurred again within the Jiaozhou Road Sihang Warehouse Isolated Battalion camp at 11:50 AM yesterday. The details of the incident are unknown, but it is understood that the Russian mercenaries fired two shots, killing one soldier of the Isolated Battalion on the spot. The Isolated Battalion and the Russian mercenaries have once again entered a state of confrontation, and the situation is very tense. According to the English-language "North China Daily News", the Isolated Battalion camp on Jiaozhou Road was quiet this morning (the 18th). However, at 1:00 PM, another incident occurred when two soldiers of the Isolated Battalion threw bricks at two Russian Volunteer Corps members guarding the camp. The Russians fired two shots, killing one Chinese soldier with a bullet wound.</p>
<p>Xie Jinyuan's Sorrowful Statement</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Isolated Battalion issued the following mimeographed statement yesterday: "Our camp's perimeter wall faces the road, with a wire mesh on top and a bathhouse below. It is common for our brothers to speak there. Today (the 18th) at 11:50 AM, a dozen or so soldiers were speaking outwards through the gaps in the wire mesh. Unexpectedly, a Russian guard standing watch on the road a few steps away raised his rifle to aim and stop them. When the brothers ignored him, the Russian fired, the bullet entering the forehead, piercing the brain, causing instant death. At the same time, another Russian standing on the left also raised his gun, aiming and firing, seriously wounding one, his life hanging in the balance. We are prepared to sacrifice ourselves at any time for justice and world civilization, and will fight to the end at any cost. I hereby request the people of Shanghai that, after we sacrifice ourselves, please collect our remains and return them to our government. Furthermore, today's news report that Battalion Commander Xie told foreign reporters that three were seriously wounded and died in the conflict the day before is incorrect. This correction is hereby made. Xie Jinyuan."</p>
<h3>Spokesman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Speaks</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesman this morning (the 18th) denied Battalion Commander Xie Jinyuan's allegations. He claimed that there had been no fatalities during the disturbances at the Jiaozhou Road Isolated Battalion camp in recent days. Although Battalion Commander Xie claimed that the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Fire Brigade used violent methods, resulting in several soldiers of the Isolated Battalion being poisoned and on the verge of death, and more than a dozen injured, the tear gas and tap water used were harmless and unlikely to cause death.</p>
<p>No Comment Without Investigation</p>
<p>The spokesman also stated that if the Isolated Battalion suffered serious injuries while throwing bricks at the Volunteer Corps guarding the camp in an attempt to regain their freedom, the Isolated Battalion should bear the responsibility. Unless the bricks thrown by the Isolated Battalion bounced back and hit themselves, they would not suffer other injuries. When asked what action the Shanghai Municipal Council planned to take regarding the Isolated Battalion, the spokesman replied that the Council could not issue a statement on the matter until a full investigation had been conducted.</p>
<p>Mutual Trust Enables Negotiation</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the situation at the Isolated Battalion camp and the Chinese Army detention camp in the French Concession was quieter this morning. Public Concession officials maintained that they had not yet been able to hold discussions with the Isolated Battalion officers. However, it is generally believed that both sides may hold negotiations within a day or two. French Concession authorities said that the situation in the French Concession detention camp could be considered to have returned to normal, but officials continued to refuse to formally announce how many Chinese soldiers were shot and killed or injured during the conflict at the camp on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Qiu Changyin Reportedly to be Released</h3>
<p>It was reported on the 15th of this month that Qiu Changyin, a wealthy businessman from Nanxun residing in Shanghai, was arrested at his residence at 184 Tongfu Road on the afternoon of the 13th by the Japanese Military Police, together with Shanghai Municipal Police officers, on suspicion of certain charges. According to an investigation by the China News Agency reporter, Qiu is not from Nanxun but is the second son of the late paint tycoon Qiu Weiqing, 18 years old, and from Yangzhou. After his arrest, the police investigation found no suspicion on any charges. Therefore, Qiu has been temporarily detained at the police station. It is also reported that Qiu's relatives and friends, including Bu Shaozhi, are actively seeking his rescue. It is believed that Qiu will soon regain his freedom.</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the Shanghai Municipal Police arrested Qiu Changyin, a wealthy man in the city, on Friday last week at the request of the relevant authorities. The Police have so far refused to disclose the reason for the arrest. Furthermore, the Police remain silent regarding the arrest of 23 Chinese people in the Putuo Road area yesterday (the 17th).</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Special Economic Committee Investigates Tax Revenue; Issue Public Notices and Plan to Invite Bids for Contracting; Education Measures Are Difficult for the Committee to Take Charge Of</h3>
<p>According to a report issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office Special Economic Committee, regarding the Council's various tax revenues, the Committee has appointed six members to form a subcommittee responsible for investigation. It is proposed that the Council publish this matter so that taxpayers who are concerned about the Council's finances can make suggestions for reference. This was adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>Printing of Public Notices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has been issuing English-language public notices since 1908. The printing and distribution have been handled by the "North China Daily News" since then. Other newspapers have often expressed dissatisfaction with this system. The Council, the Annual Meeting of Taxpayers, and a special committee appointed by the Council in August of last year have successively discussed the matter. The conclusion was that the above-mentioned distribution system was the most economical and satisfactory and did not need to be changed. However, as of today, there are aspects of the publication of public notices that should be changed. Since the public notices were changed to be issued once a month, all major measures within the Council have been published in the newspapers in a timely manner, making the newspapers the main medium for Council announcements. Therefore, the role of the public notices is only as a reference material, and its value to the public has lost its importance. Furthermore, the current circulation of English-language public notices is 11,000 copies per issue. It seems questionable whether this number is truly necessary. If the Council continues to adopt the reform of using newspapers to publish announcements, the Committee intends to propose to the Council the following: 1. Foreign taxpayers who wish to subscribe to the English-language public notices may notify the Council's General Office for registration, and then they will be mailed separately; 2. The printing of public notices should immediately adopt a public bidding method. If the above methods are adopted, the number of public notices can be reduced, and considerable expenses can be saved. As for the Chinese-language public notices, approximately 5,400 copies are printed each month and distributed by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. This can continue to be done as usual, but in view of the possibility of reducing the English-language newspapers, it is proposed that the Council discuss with the Association whether to take the same steps as the English newspapers. This report has also been adopted by the Council's Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Education Measures</p>
<p>Regarding all aspects of the Council's education measures, the Committee believes that its ability is limited and it is inconvenient to study them. It is proposed that the Council entrust another committee to be responsible for review.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Miura to Return Home on Schedule; Horinouchi to Arrive Here on the 24th</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Times," the Japanese Consulate in this city has received official news that the newly appointed Japanese Consul General to Shanghai, Horinouchi Kanekichi, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by ship on the 24th of this month. The current Japanese Consul General to Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, who has been promoted to Japanese Minister to Mexico, will hand over consular affairs to Horinouchi and return to Japan on the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Local Goods for Transportation to Shanghai; Release Upon Presentation of Certificate</h3>
<p>All items specified as subject to restricted transshipment, whether directly transported to the Shanghai Settlement area or shipped from various inland customs ports, transshipped through foreign ports, and destined for the Shanghai Settlement area, should be processed according to established foreign exchange settlement procedures. Items not specifically designated as subject to restricted transshipment do not require foreign exchange settlement or domestic sales permits, as previously reported. The respective trade associations have also received orders from the Ministry of Finance that the procedures for purchasing local goods from war zones and guerrilla areas are completely the same as above. However, when sending personnel to various areas to purchase goods, they must have a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce. Various localities will release goods upon presentation of the certificate for transport into the Shanghai Settlement.</p>
<h3>Domestic Postage to Increase from October 1st; Ordinary Letter 10 Cents, Airmail Letter 60 Cents; Shanghai Post Office Has Received Orders from the Yunnan General Post Office</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation had formulated concrete measures regarding the issue of domestic postage increases and had submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and they are to be formally implemented from October 1st of this year. This has been reported in the newspapers. Postal administrations in various regions such as the Southwest, Zhejiang, and Fujian have successively received orders. It is said that the types of postage increases this time are limited to light mail items. Ordinary letters will increase from 5 cents to 10 cents, single registered mail from 13 cents to 18 cents, double registered mail from 18 cents to 21 cents, express mail from 17 cents to 22 cents, airmail letters from 30 cents to 60 cents, and ordinary express letters from 10 cents to 15 cents. Local mail rates will also be increased appropriately, reportedly by 2 or 3 cents. A New Voice News Agency reporter recently inquired at the Shanghai Postal Administration and learned that the Bureau received an order yesterday from the Kunming Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Transportation regarding postage increases. According to a senior postal official of the Bureau, the internal procedures for various rate increases are quite complicated, and the Bureau is currently considering them separately and will issue a formal notice in the coming days to inform all sectors.</p>
<h3>Two Ships to Aojiang Unable to Enter Port; Return to Shanghai; Jiangsu Haiyi Still Not Released</h3>
<p>Foreign ships successively attempting to navigate the Aojiang route in eastern Zhejiang from Shanghai have all been intercepted by Japanese warships along the way. The British ship "Jiangsu," which sailed to Gutoutou, was detained by a Japanese warship in the waters off Ligang. As of yesterday, it had not yet been released. Reports that the ship had returned to Shanghai the day before were untrue. However, according to another report, the ship sailed directly to Wenzhou this time, but navigation was blocked due to some issue. The passengers on board disembarked at the Wenzhou pier, but the cargo was not unloaded. The exact reason for the obstruction is still unclear. Furthermore, the German ship "Jiangding" and the British ship "Anmanli," which were detained midway, had both telegraphed Shanghai by yesterday afternoon that they had been released. As the two ships were unable to enter Aojiang, they have turned back to Shanghai and are expected to arrive today or tomorrow. The Italian ship "Maberia" returned to Shanghai at noon yesterday and berthed at the Bund pier on Beijing Road. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter, the ship was subjected to mid-journey inspections by Japanese warships on both of its trial voyages and was prevented from sailing to Aojiang. Therefore, the cargo on board was returned on the original ship and was being unloaded at the pier last night. As for the German ship "Haiyi," which sailed to Songmen, it was inspected by a Japanese warship on its return journey and had not been released as of yesterday. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Songmen for the second time, and tickets had been sold and cargo was being arranged. However, with navigation now blocked, there is no definite date for its return to Shanghai. Tongtai Fengxing, the agent for the ship, has decided that if the ship cannot reach Shanghai today, it will start processing refunds the day after tomorrow to avoid inconveniencing passengers.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Alleviates the Suffering of Poultry and Livestock; Treats Livestock Humanely</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in response to a letter from the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals, notes that shops selling poultry and livestock near Yu Qiaqing Road and Guangdong Road often mistreat animals and asks for these practices to be stopped to conform to humanitarian principles. After receiving the letter, the Council instructed the Department of Health to send staff to investigate and verify the situation. Therefore, Announcement No. 5316 was issued yesterday, stating in brief: "It is ordered that merchants selling livestock, including poultry, game, birds, and frogs, etc., shall treat all such livestock in a humane manner. Vendors must take measures to prevent unnecessary suffering. Those who violate the provisions of this announcement will be prosecuted by this Council in accordance with the law."</p>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>The French Concession Rent Investigation Committee, which was originally scheduled to hold a plenary meeting in mid-September, has reportedly postponed the meeting to the end of this month. No decision has yet been made regarding the establishment of two groups, landlords and tenants, by the Rent Investigation Committee.</p>
<p>Parcel Notices: (1) Due to transportation difficulties, acceptance of collect-on-delivery parcels destined for the Longping Bureau in the Beiping area is now temporarily suspended. (2) Acceptance of curved product parcels destined for various locations along the Jinpu Railway in the Anhui area should continue to be temporarily suspended in accordance with Parcel Notice No. 246.</p>
<h3>Admiral Hepburn Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao; Expected to Arrive on the 21st Aboard Flagship; US Fleet Returns Directly to the Philippines Without Stopping in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Times," the United States Asiatic Fleet has completed its summer maneuvers in North China and is sailing back to its winter anchorage in Manila in the autumn. It is not expected to stop in Shanghai en route. Several US destroyers and the protection ship "Black Hawk" sailed directly south after weighing anchor from North China, without anchoring in Shanghai. This is the first time the US Asiatic Fleet has taken this approach, as in previous years, most ships moored in Shanghai for about a month when returning to Manila. However, the Asiatic Fleet flagship "Augusta," which moored in Qingdao and Yantai with other ships this summer, will come to Shanghai and stay for three weeks to a month before heading to Manila. The "Augusta" is carrying Admiral Hepburn and is expected to arrive here on Sunday (the 21st) and sail to Manila around mid-October. Furthermore, most of the ships of the United States Asiatic Fleet left Yantai earlier this summer than in previous years, shifting to Qingdao in early July.</p>

<h3>In the Case of the Assassination of Zhou Jinyin, Zhou's Wife is Transferred to the Japanese; The French Concession Detained Zhou's Wife Without Explaining the Reason or Disposition</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Times," Zhou Jinyin, a native of Hangzhou who previously ran a printing house in Hangzhou, was assassinated in the French Concession of this city on August 23rd and died. Zhou's wife, Fan Huiwen, was detained by the French Concession Police Department on the same day. It is learned that the French Police Department has transferred Zhou Fan to the Japanese authorities. Zhou Jinyin was assassinated and died while walking with his wife on Route des Soeurs. Zhou Fan was immediately detained at the headquarters of the French Police Department for questioning. The police did not explain the reason for detaining Zhou Fan or what measures would be taken, until now that she has been transferred to the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Indirect Possession, Pledge Lending, Farmers Bank Established</h3>
<p>The Farmers Bank of China presides over agricultural loans. The Bank has historically handled these loans using two methods: "Cooperative Credit Lending" and "Farmers' Movable Property Mortgage," which have been quite effective. It is now learned that the Bank, based on past experience and careful research, has formulated the "Farmers' Movable Property Indirect Possession Pledge Lending Method." This method is more flexible than the previous cooperative credit and movable property mortgage lending methods and provides more convenience and benefits to the general farmers. The main purpose of this method is to enable farmers to obtain credit by pledging movable property, while still being able to continue to possess the movable property. This eliminates the trouble of organizing cooperatives and does not hinder production and operation. After the implementation of this method, even immature green seedlings and livestock being raised can be pledged to obtain funds, thereby accelerating the reproduction of agricultural funds. The authorities are very pleased with the Bank's innovation and have approved its implementation.</p>
<h3>Price of Rice Drops Slightly as Cheap Rice Sales Begin Today; Many Bicycles Transport Goods to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The sixth phase of cheap broken rice sales will begin today at 2:00 PM. It is stipulated that each rice distribution point will sell 50 bags of rice per day, with each yuan buying four catties of rice. The Shanghai Cheap Rice Committee has already sent letters to the Doumi Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Industry Association, asking them to send personnel to lead at the Fuxin Factory and provide broken rice for cheap sales on a daily basis. After the rice shop tea market opened as usual at 7:30 AM yesterday morning, trade among colleagues was very quiet, and the market was unusually stable. The initial market was sluggish, and public sentiment has trended downwards, with prices continuing to fall by six or seven corners. Furthermore, about 1,000 bags of rice were transported to the city by bicycle from the suburbs yesterday, and 600 to 700 bags were loaded onto civilian boats. As for the outbound market, it is becoming deserted, and customer sales are weak. The rice market is not as prosperous as before.</p>
<h3>French Police Raid Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the French Concession Police dispatched a large number of detectives to conduct strict searches of civilian residences in the area of Rue Bourgeat and Rue des Soeurs. After about two hours, at about 8:00 PM, the French Police again dispatched detectives to separately search various small inns in the area of Route Wagner, which lasted about an hour. The searches in both locations yielded nothing.</p>
<h3>Father of Deceased Head Nurse Accused of Clearing Debt; Sues for Funeral Expenses of Li Yuying; The Sino-Western Sanitarium Refuses to Pay</h3>
<p>Regarding the suspicious death of Li Yuying, a head nurse from Fujian Province at the Sino-Western Sanitarium at 536 Route Bourgeat, also known as Li Jieru, on the night of June 10th, after the first instance verdict of innocence for Guo Zhenqing, the director of general affairs of the sanitarium, and Dr. Lin Zhengliang for forging evidence, the Special No. 2 Court Prosecutor's Office received confidential letters and is collecting evidence to file an appeal. The cash, jewelry, and clothing left by Li Yuying, worth more than ten thousand yuan, were withheld by the hospital as debts that Li incurred during her lifetime. Li's father, Li Shizhen, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against the hospital to preserve the evidence, and the accountants of both parties are currently verifying the accounts. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. However, after Li Yuying's death, Lu Zhenqing of the Sino-Western Sanitarium advocated that the body be handed over to the China Funeral Home for embalming and burial in the Hongqiao Cemetery, at a total cost of more than one thousand yuan. The Funeral Home has submitted the bill to the Sino-Western Sanitarium for forwarding to the family of the deceased, which is also a disputed account in the legacy debt case. Because the Sino-Western Sanitarium refused to pay this amount, Tao Fanwu, the manager of the China Funeral Home, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Li Yuying's father, Li Shizhen, to demand debt repayment. The court, based on the complaint, has scheduled Judge Ma Yishu to open the trial this afternoon. It is unknown when the various disputes caused by Li Yuying's sudden death will be resolved. It is also known that after the case occurred, people in the community were shocked. At that time, there were also "Lei Zhen" and "Lei Xiang Tianxia Zhi" who secretly submitted letters, expressing great dissatisfaction and encouraging the appeal of the case, volunteering to come forward and provide evidence, and describing the cause and course of Li Yuying's death in great detail, as if they were personally present. However, although Li Yuying's family knows that the deceased died unjustly, it is difficult to start for a while unless other new evidence is discovered, as the case is subject to public prosecution. Since obtaining the Lei surname letter, although the case is more than half clear, for the sake of the certainty of this case, it still needs to be investigated in many ways to facilitate the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Two Russians' Bestial Nature Erupts; Violate Russian Waitress; Drunken Revelry in the Same Car Turns Into Rape; Russian Woman Resists and Suffers Abuse and Injury</h3>
<p>Russian citizen Lan Bing and his compatriot friend Kelmen (30 years old) went to the Russian restaurant at 2, Lane 771, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, for dinner on the evening of the 17th. They feasted and drank heavily. When they finished at 11 PM, they asked the restaurant's hostess, Russian woman Bolanwan (41 years old), to ride in a car to a certain place for a joyride. The woman suspected nothing and rode with them in the car. Lan Bing drove to a Western-style hotel on Huanlong Road and drank several more bottles of wine. Then they got back into the car, drove to a remote area of Xiwai Road and Route Cardinal Mercier, and suddenly stopped. Lan Bing made advances toward the woman. When the woman refused and shouted, Lan and Kelmen became angry. Kelmen hit the woman in the head with an iron bar from the car, causing her to faint and cry for help. Lan Bing then grabbed her throat to prevent her from making noise, tore her underpants with one hand, and raped her. The woman was unable to resist and had to let him have his way. After it was over, the woman took the opportunity to escape from the car, but Kelmen dragged her back into the car and tried to rape her again. The woman shouted for help.</p>
<h3>Many Japanese Judicial Officials Visit the Court; Criminal Division of the High Court No. 2 Branch Moves Back to Original Site to Hear Cases</h3>
<p>Japanese judicial personnel recently accompanied personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council Legal Department to visit the Civil Court of the Provisional Office of the First Special District Court on Weihaiwei Road. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, twelve more Japanese judicial officials, accompanied by Brian, the chief lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council Legal Department, visited the Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court on North Zhejiang Road. They toured the various courts and then left the court by car.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court No. 2 Branch moved to the Provisional Office on Weihaiwei Road after the war. It briefly moved back to the original court site on North Zhejiang Road this summer, and then moved back to the Provisional Office on September 2nd. Now, the court believes that it is more convenient to hear criminal cases at the original court site on North Zhejiang Road. Therefore, starting today, it will move the Criminal Division back to the original court site to hear cases. Civil cases will still be heard at the office on Weihaiwei Road. Parties concerned should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Lan and Kelmen were panicked, fearing that detectives would hear the alert and come to arrest them. After driving a few feet, they forcibly pushed the woman out of the car at the intersection of Huishan Road and sped away. The woman fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries to her eyes, nose, and both knees. She got up and, because she did not carry any money, had to endure the pain and walk back to report to the Hongkou Police Station, explaining what had happened. The next day, after detectives at the Police Station learned that Lan Bing lived at 8 Route Lafayette in the French Concession, they secretly went to his address and arrested him. Kelmen lived at 18 Route Lafayette. The informant, Russian woman Bolan, was also brought back to the Police Station. The woman was sent to Renji and Guangren Hospitals for examination. The rape could not be determined because the woman had had children and because too much time had passed. Yesterday, the two defendants were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution on charges of assault and rape, requesting strict punishment. Then, Russian woman Bolan presented evidence of what happened. When asked about this, the two defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Accidental Discharge While Wiping a Handgun; Bullet Hits Abdomen; Gatekeeper Dies</h3>
<p>Wu Er (No. 561), a 35-year-old gatekeeper on Rue de Louvain, French Concession, was wiping his service pistol at the alleyway at 2:30 PM yesterday. Due to carelessness, the pistol suddenly discharged, and a bullet struck his left lower abdomen. He fell to the ground. Police officers summoned an ambulance and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, because the injury was to a vital part of his body, he died before he could be treated.</p>
<h3>Doctor Accused of Assault: Lawyer's Letter of Clarification</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Hou Yunqing. He has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years and has always maintained a high standard of conduct, having no disputes with anyone. His patients are well aware of this. However, he recently saw a news item in the Shen Bao that contained many misunderstandings and defamatory statements about him. The "Suzhou woman Ye Qi" mentioned in the news is actually Ye Qi. Ye had previously been ill and was carefully treated by Mr. Hou until she recovered. However, after her illness, Ye repeatedly came to Mr. Hou's clinic, making incessant demands. Mr. Hou learned that Ye was a divorced woman with the surname Chai and had previously cohabited with a man surnamed Wang before leaving him as well. Realizing that her intentions were not to seek medical treatment, Mr. Hou politely refused to attend to her. Unexpectedly, Ye, unable to get her way, conjured up a scheme, brought a lawsuit, and engaged in intimidation. Mr. Hou, being honest and unprepared, was taken by surprise. He has now decided to appeal the case according to the law. This is the truth. However, she has twisted the facts and engaged in malicious destruction, claiming that Mr. Hou pursued her unsuccessfully and then violently assaulted her. It is absurd to think that if Mr. Hou had indeed been pursuing her, Ye would have come to his clinic of her own accord, playing right into his hands, and he would have no reason to assault her. Anyone with a discerning eye can see the absurdity of this. However, because Mr. Hou is a medical practitioner, this slander has not only caused concern among his relatives and friends but has also affected his practice. Therefore, for the sake of clarification, Mr. Hou has requested that I, as his lawyer, write to the Shen Bao to request a prominent correction in your newspaper so that the truth can be revealed and he will not be unjustly maligned. As such, I have found that my client has a well-established reputation in the medical field. Now that his reputation is being damaged by fabricated accusations, the other party may have ulterior motives. However, reputation is a person's second life, and the impact of this matter cannot be ignored. I have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice. Having been entrusted with this matter, I am writing to request that you grant a correction in a prominent position in your newspaper as soon as possible. I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao Fuyuan</p>

Article 2: Students in provincial middle schools (excluding self-funded students) who are truly impoverished and meet one of the following criteria may be awarded and assisted: A. Those with excellent conduct, sound physical health, and an average academic score of 80 or above, with all subjects passed, will be awarded 20 yuan per semester. B.

Those with excellent conduct, sound physical health, have not missed a single class in a semester, and have passed all subjects will be awarded 5 yuan per semester. Article 3: The quotas for each type of award and assistance are as follows: A. No more than 2% of the total number of students (excluding self-funded students). B. No more than 4% of the total number of students (excluding self-funded students). C. No more than 8% of the total number of students (excluding self-funded students).

<h3>Southwest Associated University Prepares to Move to Xichang; Special Commissioners Have Been Sent for Inspection; Classes Will Still Be Held in Kunming This Semester</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The situation in Vietnam has recently become tense due to Japanese activities. The public is paying close attention to the current status of Southwest Associated University, our highest wartime institution of learning in the southwest. In particular, there have been many rumors regarding the university's impending relocation. Many Hong Kong students are planning to return to China to study at the university this year, so they are particularly concerned about the university's future direction. This reporter recently met with individuals from Kunming who are connected to the university and who had flown to Hong Kong. According to them, both the education authorities and the university authorities believe that the relocation of Southwest Associated University is inevitable. The only remaining issue is the technical details. The Ministry of Education has urged the university to relocate three times, with Xichang County in southeastern Xikang Province being the proposed location. The university authorities have convened meetings to discuss the matter. However, given that there are currently over 3,000 students and 700 faculty and staff, the transportation and campus issues during the relocation require detailed consideration. The university has already dispatched three special commissioners to Xichang to conduct on-site inspections. If they deem the location suitable, they will begin the process of finding or building a campus and contacting the relevant authorities for transportation arrangements to facilitate the relocation. The university authorities believe that it is factually impossible to relocate to Xichang for classes this semester. Currently, books and equipment that are not immediately needed are being moved to Xichang, and it is hoped that classes can begin there next semester. This semester has already been scheduled to begin in Kunming on October 1st, originally scheduled for September 23rd. As for the campus issue, most of the originally leased buildings have been reclaimed by the original universities. Therefore, this semester, students in the second, third, and fourth years can only attend classes at the New Campus and the Agricultural College. With several thousand students gathered in these two buildings, conditions are naturally extremely crowded. As for the first-year students, it is planned to allocate them to the original campus site of National Sun Yat-sen University in Zhengjiang. The university authorities have dispatched Dean of Academic Affairs Fan Jichang to plan everything. Xichang is located in the center of the four provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan included five railways passing through Xichang, demonstrating that Sun Yat-sen had long recognized the importance of Xichang's position. Xichang is located on the eastern bank of the Anning River, with continuous mountain ranges and interlaced waterways. The climate is mild, and rainfall is even. Mineral resources such as iron, coal, gold, and copper are abundant. Due to the alluvial irrigation of the Anning River and Yalong River, agricultural products are abundant. The price of rice is the lowest in the country (only eight corners for every dou, which is 40 catties). Therefore, Xichang is extremely suitable for development into an industrial and educational zone. There is currently a Xikang Technical College, with departments of engineering and agriculture.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Stars vs. Paramount Women's Basketball Exhibition Match, Shanghai Stars vs. Zhizhong Tonight at 8 PM at the YMCA</h3>
<p>The second game of the Charity Basketball Challenge will be held tonight. In addition to the emerging powerhouse Shanghai Stars vs. Paramount, there will also be a women's exhibition match between Shanghai Stars and Zhizhong. The games will start at 8 PM at the YMCA on Baixianqiao. The men's game will begin at 8:45 PM. Both men and women's teams are well-prepared and will surely put on an unprecedented performance. Only 200 tickets remain for tonight's game due to enthusiastic promotion and sales from all sides. The Shanghai Stars have independently sold 120 of the nine-yuan honorary tickets and no less than 100 of the one-yuan tickets, which is commendable. The game ball will still be auctioned off today. At the same time, Mr. Xiao Zongjun, the manager of the Fresh Orange Juice Company, will also generously donate his famous beverage, Green Treasure Orange Juice, for charity sales at the venue, without deducting costs, all to benefit the expenses of the children's care home. In addition to the charity sales, the company will also donate a silver cup, along with the one donated by Mr. Zhang Shuliang, the president of the Shanghai Stars, to be awarded as prizes for tonight's game.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stars' Strength</p>
<p>All of the Shanghai Stars' players are outstanding athletes from the South, such as Liang Yunming, Chen Xuechong, Zhuo Guorong, Xu Heng, and Yuan Zejian, all of whom are famous players in the basketball world. Center Zheng Qinming, who just transferred from Pui Ching Middle School in Guangzhou to Shanghai University, is tall and accurate in his shots, making him a new rising star in Shanghai's basketball scene. Players like Guo Zhixiong have also achieved great success at Fushi, while Yuan Zejian was a key player for Jining and Zhenru, dominating Shanghai before the war. As for Chen Xuechong, Liang Yu, Zhuo, Xu, etc., they are the same as Paramount and need no introduction. Although Paramount is known as the perennial champion, they are wary of this "dark horse" today.</p>
<p>Women's Exhibition</p>
<p>As a prelude, the women's basketball exhibition match between Shanghai Stars and Zhizhong will feature a team of famous players from Shanghai Stars, including Rong Mozhen, Chen Liuzhen, Pan Baojian, Deng Xiuchun, etc., who have been selected to represent Shanghai and other regions. Recently, they have been joined by new famous players from Hong Kong, Lin Wanxia and Qian Miaoxian, further enhancing their strength. The Zhizhong team is a new army trained by Zhang Juefei, and includes Wang Jianyu and Chen Hualan, representatives from Hangzhou. The team has also specially invited several famous players from the Jingwu women's basketball team to join and assist.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Order</p>
<p>In terms of order, the organizers hope that the audience will remain calm and appreciate the technical performance of both sides and refrain from making unnecessary hissing sounds to maintain sportsmanship and spirit. The referee will enforce the rules and make fair judgments without bias. Furthermore, this is a charity event.</p>

<h3>Finance: Limited Foreign Exchange Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The black market for British and American currencies lacked excitement, with a tightening trend and a lack of active trading. Operators are waiting for environmental factors and various stimulating news. However, considering that sellers were quick to unload and Chinese and foreign banks had strong demand, supply and demand were perfectly balanced. From morning to noon, there was only a fluctuation of 0.03125. However, the shilling continued to soften, as buyers were inquiring more often. The closing prices were British gold at 3 pence 546875 and US currency at 5.28125 yuan, with the US currency unchanged and the British currency down 0.03125 compared to the previous day.

Afterwards, the bank first intended to sell, so the price hardened slightly. It was calculated that it would be profitable to take in US currency at 5.3125 yuan for this month. However, it was reported that the volume of transactions was not very high. HSBC's listed rates were announced with no changes. The silver balancing tax was announced, increasing by 0.75 percent. After this, foreign banks suddenly had demand, and sellers also decreased. At this time, a foreign bank offered a price of 5.25 yuan for next month's US currency, while this month's US currency had softened to 5.28125 yuan. The process was stable. Nearing noon, Huashang Bank, Jin Cheng, and Youli all purchased US currency for next month at 5.25 yuan, indicating that the potential for US currency was quite stable.

The initial asking price was around 6,180 yuan and 90 yuan. Later, due to the slight softening of the exchange market, it once reached 6,220 yuan. However, there were rare transactions.

<h3>Food: 洋米 Settled</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the black market for current 洋米 opened with sellers' intentions quite firm, so the market was stable. Later in the market, because the city's sixth-term 平耀 began, the actual sales in the street were sparse. Furthermore, there were rumors that Hong Kong's food restrictions had been relaxed, so people became even more discouraged, and prices continued to drop by a small five or six corners compared to yesterday.

It is rumored that there are a large number of 洋米 ships outside Wusongkou waiting to enter the port for unloading. (祖)</p>

<p>Thick, thin, broken, 粳, and other national rice still have not arrived. However, early and late rice from Nangang have arrived in limited quantities, but appetite is not good, so the black market price is slightly smaller by half a yuan. The opening prices were: Changbang Special 粳 opened at 80 yuan to 79.5 yuan, Ordinary opened at 76 or 77 yuan, Wu Chang Su 崑粳 opened at 78 yuan, Next opened at 74 or 75 yuan, Kunshan Fragrant 粳 opened at 75 yuan to 74 yuan, Qingpu Thin Broken opened at 76 yuan, Nangang Early Broken, because supply exceeds demand, the market price was close to a yuan.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Quiet</h3>

<p>London, 17th (Tuesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and stocks of British companies in the Far East were all flat. There was no change in the market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cotton Market Closed, Overseas Cotton Market Firm</h3>

<h3>Piece Goods: Flannel Moves Well in the Autumn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, flannel saw a major turning point, with both retail and wholesale transactions increasing. Because the Autumn Festival has passed, the cold weather has boosted actual sales. In general, in recent market conditions, western-style materials are more active than Chinese-style materials, ordinary goods sell better than high-end goods, the sales of domestic factory goods are better than imported goods, and men's flannel sells better than women's colored flannel. 板四 flannel 海力司 is particularly popular due to products from many countries and cheaper prices. 花呢 sells well in the range of 20 to 30 yuan per yard. Overcoats in the 20 yuan range are quite popular with buyers. The sales of dark blue 华特 flannel have decreased due to the depreciation of medium-thick 哔叽. 啥咪呢 is popular in black, gray, dark blue, and vegetable green colors. Herringbone wide willow patterns are even more popular. Single-sided 花呢 limited to 20 yuan within the Customs is dominant. Horsehair sleeves are traded quite often every day. Because 马裤呢 is unpredictable, buyers are mostly hesitant and unwilling to move forward. Because 开水咪 is expensive, this has led to opportunities for 迭成友生 waterproof cloth and non-Western goods to become active.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Today, 530 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 945 pieces to Hong Kong, 70 pieces to Singapore, and 10 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Grain and Sundries   Sesame Oil Cakes and Beans</h3>

<p>Bean Cakes: Today, 1,850 pieces are being shipped to Xiamen, and another 2,320 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Grains: Today, 750 bags of beans are being shipped to Xiamen, and another 3,230 bags, along with 500 bags of raw peanuts and 50 bags of sesame seeds, are being shipped to Hong Kong. Additionally, 320 bags of sesame seeds are being shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts:  New Walnuts Appear, Melon Seeds Remain Tight</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have become scarce recently, leading to a continued upward trend in the market. Tongcheng and Baoying seeds are priced above 83, 84, or 85 yuan, while smaller varieties like Mingguang and Linhuai seeds are at 77 yuan. Newly selected Xin Changping walnuts are priced at 93 yuan.

<h3>Metals: Optimism for New Deals</h3>
<p>The metal market is showing optimism as autumn arrives. Dealers anticipate more price increases than decreases. The trend for new deals has become active since the nail factory started operations. Sentiment is strong, with prices expected to rise and not fall. Currently, each dan (unit of weight) is sold for 50 yuan, and sellers are reluctant to let go easily.</p>

<p>Society</p>
<h3>Paradise in the Human World</h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>In this vast and boundless world, an individual is but a splash of water in the roaring tide, so insignificant as to be negligible. The individual in relation to society is no more than a brick in a massive building. No one would believe that a great building could not be built exquisitely because one brick is substandard, but they will feel a sense of deficiency due to a substandard brick.</p>
<p>Facts tell us that humans cannot live alone, detached from society. Regardless of whether human nature is inherently good or evil, and the extent to which it influences life, everything is a gift from society, an undeniable fact. From the moment one is born, they are influenced by primary groups such as family and neighborhood. As they grow older, they are affected by secondary groups like schools and society, establishing the foundation for beliefs, morals, habits, and knowledge. Unhealthy parents (including soundness in knowledge and morals, of course) will certainly not nurture excellent children. We need not be overly critical of those who deserve blame because they, like us, have received a portion of the legacy bestowed by society.</p>
<p>We cannot privately celebrate our fate and be stingy with the fine traditions that society has given us. We know well the close relationship between people, and we know that we cannot transcend the world to seek only our own perfection, and we cannot bear to stand by and do nothing when we see the danger of the masses falling into decline. No matter anyone's actions, or the nature of those actions, it is inevitable that they will affect the entire society. Only through human actions can society harmonize. For the sake of all humanity, the overall situation of society, and also for ourselves, we must not allow any blemish on the society of the future.</p>
<p>This is indeed a difficult task. We need not be daunted by our own insignificance and lament. As the German Rudolf Eucken said, "We have self-awareness, knowing that we cannot pretend to be the masters of truth, but we must engage in the discovery of truth." We must grasp the truth. Truth will never appear insignificant because of our insignificance. On the contrary, the insignificance of the individual will become greatness because of the truth.</p>
<p>Personalities</p>
<h3>The Scientific Eccentric Einstein</h3>
<p>— Ling Chongzhen</p>
<p>When Einstein turned fifty, Germany celebrated nationwide, gifting him a house and a small boat, and commissioning a statue of him in celebration. Who would have thought that in the years that followed, he not only lost all of his property but also had to flee to Belgium, living in seclusion and hiring a police officer to sleep beside his couch at night to protect his life. He has now fled from Belgium to the United States, where he is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton University, and has become a naturalized American citizen.</p>
<p>Einstein is by nature quiet, disregards honor, and does not seek fame or fortune. Once, a shipowner specially prepared several magnificent rooms for him on an ocean liner sailing across the Atlantic, showing him great favor. However, he said without hesitation, "I would rather sit in steerage than accept this extremely preferential treatment."</p>
<p>Einstein said that there are only twelve people in the world who truly understand the theory of relativity, although there are over nine hundred books discussing his theory of relativity.</p>
<p>"For example, when you sit next to a lovely girl, an hour will seem like a minute; but if you sit next to a hot stove, a minute will seem like a sledgehammer." This is the theory of relativity, Einstein said.</p>
<p>We should encourage and supervise each other with steadfast faith and noble thoughts. We should lead those who are hovering before the traps of sin away from the wrong path, and ignite the lighthouse of the Black Sea with enthusiasm, pointing out the bright path in the surging waves.</p>
<p>We must irrigate ourselves with truth, and we must also irrigate others with truth. We must make every small grass grow into useful timber, and make every brick become huge granite, in order to build paradise in the human world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Einstein admits that she does not understand the theory of relativity, but she understands something that a wife needs to understand even more: she understands her husband. She says that her husband is very organized in his thinking, but quite the opposite in his life. He likes to do whatever comes to mind, whenever and wherever. He has two rules for self-discipline: first, do not follow any rules. Second, do not let the opinions of others sway your own thoughts.</p>
<p>Einstein's daily life is very simple. He usually wears old and not very neat clothes, and he rarely wears a hat. However, he has a rich and happy life. His philosophy of happiness seems even greater than his theory of relativity. The source of his happiness is entirely due to his ability to be self-sufficient, without envy or demands. He finds life and true happiness in his work, playing the violin, and sailing a small boat.</p>
<p>Once in Berlin, he told a ticket seller on a bus that he had given him the wrong change. The ticket seller carefully counted it again, found no mistake, and handed the money back to him, saying, "Sir, your arithmetic is really too bad."</p>
<h3>Effort</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Jiqi</p>
<p>If you want knowledge, you must work for it; if you want bread, you must work for it; if you want joy, you must also work for it. Effort is the method. Joy comes from effort, not from arbitrary actions and complacency. When a person has a love for work, his life will surely be the most joyful. (J. Ruskin) (Yet Reward)</p>
<p>Hawthorn Case</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Destiny</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: "Take Him Away"</p>
<p>As Hawthorn spoke, his two solemn eyes remained fixed on that round, plump face. However, those agile eyes were now dull and lifeless, lacking the courage to meet Hawthorn's gaze. He only stared at the tea stains on the floor that had not yet dried, secretly biting his lip.</p>
<p>He reluctantly replied, "You're mistaken, I! was indeed over there."</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded. "Good, this point is easy to prove, there's no need to talk nonsense now. Second, after the heavy rain last night, you had Mingjin go to Wang Lilan's house, but you repeatedly said that you sent her to the door and didn't get out of the car!"</p>
<p>Before Hawthorn could finish, he rushed to say, "Ridiculous, I certainly didn't get out of the car. How could I have entered her house?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn slowly said, "But your footprints are clearly left on the floor of her house – your shoe prints."</p>
<p>"My shoe prints? How strange!" His surprise seemed very alarmed.</p>
<p>Hawthorn continued to speak to himself, "I'm taking you away because of this strange point. Brother Jinshou, judging by these two reasons, it shouldn't be considered illegal to temporarily detain him for further investigation, right?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou furrowed his brow and raised his right hand, scratching his chin vigorously, clearly believing this was a rare and difficult deadlock, but he had no way to break it.</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng looked at him again and gasped, "Detective Ni, this is not true! I can guarantee with my reputation that I really didn't go into her house last night! I can swear that I really didn't go in! As for Lilan's death, I have absolutely no connection! I! Why would I kill her? I want to find out who the murderer is! Detective Ni, you should believe me." He was not only gasping, but his tone was also trembling.</p>
<p>Ni Yushou forced out two sentences of reluctant sympathy in helplessness. "Mr. Lu, I also believe that you wouldn't do this. However, the two points that Mr. Hawthorn mentioned are indeed not easy to explain!" His eyes looked at Hawthorn's face, seemingly hoping that Hawthorn could give a sign that could turn things around.</p>
<p>At this moment, I felt that Hawthorn's eyes seemed to flicker at Ni Yushou, and there was clearly a hint in it, but for a moment, I could not explain its nature.</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng turned back to Hawthorn and said, "Mr. Hawthorn, don't misunderstand. I really didn't kill Lilan. Whoever killed her, as long as I can find out, I will definitely reward you generously. Mr. Hawthorn, you must not misunderstand." (111)</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<h3>Speaking and Doing</h3>
<p>— Wang Ting</p>
<p>I once heard a saying: "Germans do but don't speak, British do and then speak, Japanese speak and then do, Chinese speak but don't do, Indians neither speak nor do."</p>
<p>Here, the Chinese are listed as the fourth class—although still above the Indians, but India is a nation that has lost its country, so it is said that it cannot be compared with us; so after hearing this, many "descendants of Yan and Huang" were indignant and felt "deeply moved."</p>
<p>Feeling "deeply moved" is actually a bit promising - after being moved, you will naturally think about doing something. What is really "deeply moved" is that some people, after being "indignant", think like this: "Do you understand our thousands of years of spiritual civilization?" or: "Speaking and not doing is better than not saying anything."</p>
<p>The former is the tone of a degenerate descendant who embraces scrap metal and recalls the "glory" of his ancestors, while the latter is a manifestation of the Ah Q spirit that has been hidden in the hearts of our nation for thousands of years.</p>
<p>These two kinds of people, although their tones are different, their "lack of promise" is the same. It is indeed undoubted that those who only boast about the "glory" of their ancestors and the degenerate descendants of the rich will never be able to do anything, and that speaking and not doing is not "better" than not saying anything.</p>
<p>To rise from decline, to break out of the cursed environment of empty shouting and sighing, you must first feel a bit of emotion, you must first understand the source of your own corruption!</p>
<p>Only in this way can we, after being moved and after understanding the source of our own disease, truly do something and treat our old disease with the right medicine!</p>
<p>In recent years, it seems that many people in China have, after being moved, understood the source of their own disease, and are doing things in a down-to-earth manner. This is naturally a gratifying phenomenon. However, on the other hand, the phenomenon of "speaking and not doing" has not yet been completely eliminated, which is also a disgrace to the country and the nation!</p>
<p>The reason why it cannot be completely eliminated, I believe, is because the first two kinds of people have not fully understood the source of their own disease, or even if they understand, they do not know how to prescribe the right medicine to treat it.</p>
<p>What has enabled China to sustain a war of resistance for freedom for three years is not the traditional so-called spiritual civilization, nor the "glory" of our ancestors, but the amazing power exerted by many people who used to "speak and not do" but are now working in a down-to-earth manner!</p>
<p>The growth of the new China depends on everyone doing things in a down-to-earth manner!</p>
<h3>Buckingham Palace Six Maxims</h3>
<p>— Tianshui</p>
<p>In Buckingham Palace in London, England, which was recently bombed, the following six maxims are posted on the wall of the study:</p>
<p>(1) Follow the rules when competing.</p>
<p>(2) Value feelings, but do not abuse emotions, the two should be distinguished.</p>
<p>(3) Do not utter or accept frivolous language.</p>
<p>(4) If you suffer hardship, learn from good beasts and walk away in silence.</p>
<p>(5) If you can win, then win; if you cannot win, then be a beautiful loser.</p>
<p>(6) Do not weep over the moon, nor weep over spilled milk.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk on Young "Bearded" Actors</h3>
<p>— Yuchu</p>
<p>Among the younger "bearded" actors, the ones who have come to Shanghai to perform for the first time in the past two years include Sha Shixin and Chi Shigong, who is currently performing at the Renewal Theater. It is said that Golden Theater has also invited Li Hezeng to play the role of Xin Yanqiu, following Li Shengzao, which is said to be revealed later. The aforementioned three people have different styles and their artistic skills are also</p>
<p>Each has its own merits.</p>
<p>Sha Shixin's previous visit to Shanghai did not achieve good results. The biggest reason for his failure was his muffled voice. His style of acting and dialogue has some resemblance to Lian Liang, and his appearance and costumes are very similar, so he is known as Little Ma Lianliang. Before, I watched his first night's performance of "Ganlu Temple," but it was not as well-received as Guan Shengxi, who played Liu Bei. On the day of his departure, he posted the complete "Famen Temple," and in the "Meiwu County" section of the road, a sentence was omitted, which caused a lot of booing from the audience. This trip was truly unfortunate for this person. Now he should bury himself in hard work in order to come to Shanghai again one day and wash away his previous shame. Chi Shigong and Shixin are from the same class</p>
<p>Brothers of Fu Liancheng Society.</p>
<p>His appearance is quite handsome, his style is generous, and his craftsmanship is also experienced. It is a pity that his voice is a bit low, but his singing is very rhythmic. He can also handle high notes. In addition, with Geng Shaofeng, Yang Baosen's former accompanist, playing the piano for him, it can add a lot of color. Before, I listened to his shared performance of "Empty City Stratagem," and both the Xipi slow beat and the Erliu sections on the city wall were excellent. It is said that the sentence "A person with a calm temperament" won thunderous applause. If his voice could be louder, his future would be promising. His acting style is pure and orthodox, and his singing style does not</p>
<p>Win with novelty.</p>
<p>He has similarities with Tan Fuying, and Fuying and Shigong took turns performing "Empty City Stratagem" at the Renewal Theater, which happened to coincide, so it is appropriate to call him Little Tan Fuying. Li Hezeng is a top student of the drama school. His appearance is plain and he is known for his singing skills. His voice is quite high-pitched and loud, but his acting and dialogue are slightly inferior. His best plays, such as "Crying at the Qin Court," "Xiaoyaojin," and "Gifting the Silk Robe," are all Gao Qingkui's signature works. He is a small Gao Qingkui who is completely unoriginal. He once</p>
<p>Formed a troupe to perform on his own.</p>
<p>His results were quite good. If Golden Theater can keep Qingkui in Shanghai and let him help his favorite disciple, Hezeng, then Hezeng's chances of becoming popular with one singing will be even greater. Other examples include Wang Helin and Zhao Jinnian of the drama school, Ye Shichang of Fushe, and Xu Rongkui of Rongchun Society, whose acting styles are mostly based on Ma (Lianliang), and who have already gained a reputation in Beijing. I am afraid that they will soon come to Shanghai to perform one after another.</p>
<h3>"China's Snow White" Begins Filming Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Leng Bai</p>
<p>This spring, child star Chen Juanjuan returned to Shanghai from distant Nanyang. With her glorious past, she was immediately hired by the Guolian Film Company. Originally, her first film was planned to be "China's Snow White," directed by Wu Yonggang. However, just as filming was about to begin, a wave of competition for folk-themed films suddenly surged in the film industry. Consequently, "China's Snow White" was temporarily shelved. Wu Yonggang directed the film "Courtesan," and Chen Juanjuan wore ancient costumes for the first time, playing a small prostitute in "Du Shiniang."</p>
<p>Now that the trend of folk-themed films is gradually subsiding, the Guolian authorities have revived the old plan to produce "China's Snow White." Fortunately, the director Wu Yonggang had already completed the draft and was just waiting to begin filming.</p>
<p>After a week of meticulous research on costumes, they are generally satisfied. Yesterday, the first scene began filming. Because this is a musical film, Chen Juanjuan first recorded a song in advance.</p>
<p>As for the cast, in addition to Chen Juanjuan as Snow White, the role of the evil stepmother was originally intended for Bai Hong. However, because Bai Hong will be playing the cartoon model of Princess Iron Fan in "Princess Iron Fan," Lu Luming will replace her. The seven dwarfs will still be played by Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, Tang Jie, Zhang Zhizhi, Hong Jingshi, Ge Furong, and Guan Hongda, which can be said to include the entire film industry's comedians.</p>
<p>According to Wu Yonggang, many places will adopt the exaggerated techniques of cartoons, such as a sneeze that opens all the doors and windows, and a photo on the wall that immediately changes its smile to anger when it sees a hated character. In short, it will be made into a fairy tale comedy that is not only interesting but also meaningful.</p>

He could infer ten things from one example, enjoying the Way and content with poverty. The world praised his benevolence. Confucius spent his life practicing benevolence and righteousness, "not caring for his family when serving the world," not shying away from danger or hardship. Hui followed closely, never leaving his side. Although their relationship was that of teacher and student, their affection was like that of father and son. Hui was intelligent and diligent, surpassing all other disciples. His hair turned white at the age of twenty-nine, and he died young at the age of thirty-two. Confucius cried with great sorrow, repeatedly calling out, "Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!" His grief can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Prelude: Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera</h3>
<p>"Twenty Kinds of Storytelling" has many readers who enjoy the unusual, which greatly inspires the author! "Yue Opera," although a "local opera," has become almost universally known and fashionable in Shanghai in recent years.</p>
<p>When the radio broadcasts Yue Opera, girls cannot help but sing along in melodious voices. The author has a housemate, originally from Suzhou but raised in Shanghai; logically, she should have no connection with "Yue Opera," but she loves to listen and sing. Her singing is gentle and elegant, like a daughter of Yue; her guest appearances on stage are no less than those of "one Juan and three Flowers." The prevalence of Yue Opera can be imagined.</p>
<p>Although Yue Opera is extremely popular, it is not vulgar. The lyrics contain many natural and beautiful lines that even self-proclaimed elegant poets cannot express.</p>
<p>There are more than twenty kinds of "Storytelling," and of course, more than twenty kinds of "Yue Opera"; this article only selects a few of the more famous ones.</p>
<p>"Twenty Kinds of Storytelling" had one illustration for each kind; this article will have one illustration for every two kinds; two kinds will be published each week, and the entire article will be published in ten weeks.</p>
<p>The manuscript is completed and awaiting publication, so here is a "prelude" as usual.</p>
<h3>Universal Increases Production</h3>
<p>The American "Theatre Magazine," which specializes in reporting on the entertainment industry, announced last month the production plans of Hollywood film companies for the coming year, stating that due to the war situation in Europe, studios are reducing production compared to usual to avoid the impact of the situation. However, Universal Pictures is increasing production to fifty-nine films. The company's profits in the first half of this year also increased by more than eighty-six percent compared to the same period last year. The company has now decided to increase production and strive for excellence in quality.</p>
<h3>Storytelling and Drama</h3>
<p>— Yin Yang</p>
<p>Actors, Amateurs, Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>Storytelling and drama are not very related, but both perform stories and present the heroic deeds of thousands of years to the audience, so their missions can be said to "reach the same destination by different paths." The only difference is their performance style: "Storytelling uses the mouth, drama uses the legs."</p>
<p>"The storyteller's mouth and the actor's legs" both possess a mysterious power. Storytellers, whether performing Pinghua or Tanci, narrate events from books using their eloquent tongues, conveying the stories in a roundabout way, in a well-organized manner. Actors rely on their legs to move the plot, transforming a small space into palaces, government offices, high mountains, and flowing rivers. Similarly, they can allow the audience to understand complex situations clearly after hearing the narration and seeing the performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, we know that storytelling and drama, while seemingly unrelated, can sometimes be closely connected. Pinghua performers often act out the characters on the stage, while Tanci performers often make small gestures and mannerisms to express joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. While this is appropriate for storytelling, it can also seamlessly blend into drama. Therefore, famous actors like Jiao Tian and Xiao Lou would sometimes linger in storytelling venues to observe expressions, and famous storytellers like Zhao Heqing and Ye Shengyang would often visit theaters to study acting techniques. In the past, when the Tianchan Stage performed "Investiture of the Gods," they hired storytellers to narrate the highlights, transferring the essence of storytelling to the stage. Storytellers have also used Tanci scripts, adding colorful elements to the stage, and having actors perform the movements. It can be seen that storytelling and drama can be integrated.</p>
<p>Therefore, the author feels that storytelling and drama can learn from each other. Yu Shuyan, who has retired to his hometown, and Gao Qingkui, who has recently come to Shanghai, both have a great interest in storytelling. "Stones from other mountains can polish jade." The success of a famous artist, by drawing parallels, can also be of great help.</p>
