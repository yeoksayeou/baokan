<p>社評論日美關係　　試披閱最近日方種種言論，幾乎衆口一詞的指出所謂『建設東亞新秩序』前途之充滿荆棘、並且深深意識到日本未來的艱難。假如日人能夠在從　具有此種覺悟，則太平洋危機或不致發展釗如此嚴重程度：日本自身地位，也可以免於陷入進退維谷的困境；不但如此，日本還得因爲歐洲的冉度大戰而欣逢其再度的黃金時代；然而日本却不幸的自已造成了不堪補救的錯誤。　　日本在政治軍事以至外交的種種失敗，主因在於輕敵和短見。因爲輕敵，所以敢於冒險盲動，幻想不致遭遇重大阻力。因爲短見，所以認識不淸，估量不準，因而一切運用和措置，都得判與預期相反的結果。十年以來，無論侵華戰爭或應付列强。無非犯了這兩種大病；即偶爾稍有覺悟，大多在碰壁之後，但已經鑄成了的大錯，却很少能圖挽回。最近日美關係之演進，適足對於此一現象作有力的說明。　　在日本的認識當中，一向把遠東的英國視爲當前的敵人；一方因爲英國處境的艱危，一方迷惑於英國綏靖政策的一成不變，日本總幻想能獲得英國屈服，即不難克償大願。對於美國却僅止敬而遠之，私意以爲只要能得英國的妥協，對美儘可不必顧慮。雖然九年以來，美國之於遠東。有不承認主義的揭櫫，有一九三八年終的對日照會有格魯嚴重警告的演說，有對日商的的取消；其間一脈相通實足以說明美國遠東政策的堅定性和一貫性；而日方則始終相信美國的持重是變相的怯懦，不妨欺以其方，而且美國遠越重洋來，對日作戰總是不可思議的事。及至法國敗北美國自危，日方此種情緒乃更見張熾，竟公然把各國在南洋的各屬領列入東亞共榮圈範圍之內；宣言對美不再取媚態外交，最後且與德義進一步結納以相危脅，且由近衛松岡一度發出對美不惜一戰的恫嚇，反美運動亦與之相應而高漲。此種情勢在一月以前適發展到最高的巔峯。但彼時絕不是日方已確具制勝美國的把握，而只是估量在歐陸鏖戰正酣之際，美國可能因大西洋方面的威脅與大選問題的牽制，對日種種，止於空泛的高調。但結果顯然恰奸相反，美國的反應不是妥協讓步而是禁運擴軍備戰撒僑以至加緊援助中國。而日當局態度遂自美國轉趨强硬那一天開始百八十度的轉變，多方從事聲辯和解釋，甚至不顧德義觀感如何而强謂三國盟的並非針對美國，且於義希發生戰事之際力謀逃避互助義務，此種態度，由霞關當局的松岡須磨，發揮到淋漓盡致。最近因駐美大使崛內謙介調回，更一度擬以「親美」「反對三國同盟」的小林大將繼任，重新回復到阿部野村的舊調。然而此際調整美日關係的任務却逈小同於一年以前；昨據東京消息，謂松岡曾徵詢外交界人士多人，均以在現行局勢之下對美外交極難討好爲理由而無人願膺美使之職，東京人士則表示希望美國勿因使節久懸而懷疑日本對美有所不滿。此類現象，殊不類向以革新外交相標榜的松岡作風，且與其一月以前態度大相逕庭，但却都是確鑿的事實。　　美國之內外政策一向沈着堅定，正與日本之動搖善變大異其趣。日方曾經解釋最近美國的强硬態度謂爲競選過程中的一種姿態，誠如是，則日方又何爲小心翼翼以求緩和？足見這不過是自慰的託詞，美國外交政策之不因大選而有所變更，日方是十分明瞭的，前述日本最近的輿論已充分顯示了一般的惶惑。　　但是這種情勢却不能認爲日方有意悔禍，其實至多也只是自相警戒並在日益困難的環境之中有所期待。因爲以今日之日本而冒昧對美挑戰，總是非常不智的事；軍事經濟實力的懸殊，對華戰爭的牽制，蘇日外交的僵持，都是日方絕大的弱點，。最近日當局對美態度之極度和緩，如果不是希冀美方堅定政策的趨於鬆弛—這種可能顯極微小—則至少是要藉此延宕時間，俾得完成對亞洲大陸與南洋的經濟榨取，對華戰局之縮小以至結束，與對蘇談判的成就；這些企圖，現在都在分途進行中。俾與松岡須磨的溫和面目相互配合。此外歐洲戰局的發展也是一個重要因素，德義最近作戰的支絀，無疑也貶抑了日閥的勇氣，假如德義迅佔優勢，那也正是日方從事冒險的又一衝動。　　雖然日方最近輿論漸能認識自身處境之嚴重，但當其未能克服急進一派勢力以前，其結論必不是懸崖勒馬而是加緊準備。試看軍部喉舌的國民新聞，至今毫未改變其强硬對美的一貫立塲，而對於松岡的和緩外交亦從未加以抨擊，顯然這又是兩面政策的傑搆；以松岡的爲人，固然與白鳥一輩略有差別，但也不致因美國巨棒的抨擊而驟變爲幣原路綫的追隨者。日美關係的未來，不難從日方這一主要基調獲知其輪廓。英海相宣布　英軍在希臘登陸　英空軍協助希軍作戰　義軍向卡拉巴卡推進　　倫敦　英海相亞歷山大在此廣播、謂英軍巳在希臘境登陸、而該處海軍現得天空援助云、按此爲英軍在希臘登陸之第一决官塲佈吿、（三日路透社電）　　倫敦　英海長今晨廣播演說稱、英已急派遠征軍艦隊、以及飛機至希臘、其演辭有曰、「吾人不背對希之誓的、英海軍已在彼處、空軍亦往援助、那不勒斯之軍事目標、早已爲英機所炸、英陸軍已在那希境登岸、吾人將盡其所能、對軸心國勝利之路、方在開始建築也」、海長演說之際、並向墨索里尼挑戰、請其派義艦隊至地中海、與英海軍一決雌雄、海長又暗示、新自美國獲得之逾齡驅逐艦五十艘、確係使英國能增强其地中海艦隊之主耍因果、（三日國際電）　　羅馬　官方昨日發表文告稱、義軍於深入希臘途中、已通過雅尼那、官報並聲稱、義軍在愛琴海作戰者、已獲勝利、同時義軍在地中海東部及東非洲亦獲勝利、據稱、義軍一縱隊深入雅尼那、東向前進、至昨日巳在賓多山脈作戰、另一縱隊則已將雅尼那加以包圍、該鎭之陷落、僅指顧間事、義空軍昨日飛至沙拉米斯上空、在各府島之軍事目標投擲炸彈、據公報稱、義空軍並曾轟炸泊於該港中之船隻、（三日合衆電）　　南國歐里德　希義兩國軍隊昨循兩條河流一帶、激戰甚烈、義軍搭架浮橋、已渡過喀拉馬斯河、但另一路義國企圖越過比斯德里克河者、已被擊退渡喀拉馬斯河之義軍、據稱現循喀拉馬斯流域前進、向雅尼那進攻、希轟炸機在該流域中之洛達尼村、卽義軍渡河之處、向義軍之集中隊投擲炸彈、又據報義軍於星期五夜、已在哥爾嘉區域越入希境、但希飛機旋將比斯德里克河上之一橋樑炸毀、義軍侵入希境僅一公里、至是遂被挫、唯聞義軍仍在企國越過該河、義車目下顯然擬大舉進攻卡斯脫里亞該處爲一公路交叉點、北通弗羅林拿及沙朗尼加、南通賴普西斯塔、軍略上一要點也、（三日合衆電）　　南國京城　消息靈通之希臘人士昨稱、皮爾克司他戰役中、希臘已俘獲意軍四百人、（三百合衆電）　　南斯拉夫皮多里　據希臘阿爾巴尼亞前綫昨日消息謂、阿爾巴尼亞之義軍、已自十二師增至十四師、（三日合眾電）　　鐵蘭那　余昨隨義大利重機械部隊越崎嶇山路至傑尼那前綫、見山中狹隘途徑中、有義軍十二輛前進、據其官員稱、義車已將雪馬里亞省城傑尼那圍困、而義軍所用戰器、卽於雨後山區、亦能便於適用、（三日合衆電）　　羅馬　今午義車戰報載稱、埃庇魯斯區戰事續有進展、吾軍自泰里尼、經貝拉蒂向卡拉巴卡推進、沿途攻陷鞏固陣錢多處、吾機前往各府島轟炸，該島軍專目標所受損失甚重、吾機襲擊薩洛尼卡、曾與敵機發生空戰、敵機或有一架被吾擊落、吾機轟炸那伐里諾及卡里亞港之港務設備、多處中彈起火、吾機二架未返原防、昨有義大利潛水艇二艘未返根據地、（三日海通電）英軍派接洽員　協助希軍工作　　雅典　中東央軍司令部之特派接洽員已於星期五夜抵此、據官塲消息、英接洽員到後、卽在希軍司令部開始工作、希人聞之、咸大滿意、（三日路透電）　　羅馬　「曼薩格洛報」今日刊載希臘戰局之詳情稱雅尼那方面有少數英國空軍協助希臘軍隊作戰、希臘動員軍隊、今已有百分之八十入伍希臘向英國所定之坦尼車尙未運到、一部份高射砲則已在中途、希臘軍隊雖英勇作戰、但鞏固之邊界防錢已爲義軍所突破、該報繼稱、英國會於十月二十五日與二十八日之間、向希臘保證倘義希發生衝突、土耳其將出而援助希臘、（三日海通電）薩洛尼加上空　義希空軍劇戰　　雅典　希臘及義國飛機昨在薩洛尼加上空死戰、希機一架因彈藥用罄、其勇敢之機師卽獨向一義大利轟炸機上猛撞義機、當墮於沙埠大街、警察擒獲其中義機師四人、至落地之機師、則未受傷、街中救護隊現奮男搜掘斷垣中屍體或被埋人民、據計昨日義機空襲五次、死五十八人、受傷一百四十人、毀房屋六十所、電話局亦被損、但據最近報吿、死傷人數猶在激增、瓦礫堆中續有不少屍體發見、（三日合衆社電）　　羅馬　傳義陸空兩軍昨夜對希軍之前鋒及後方、曾予以嚴重打擊、使希　之抵抗力、大爲减弱、此間陸軍司令部發表官方公報稱、法西斯坦克車及機械化部隊、已完成其包圍行動、因此衆料雅尼那之陷落、僅指顧間事、同時公報稱、義國飛機向各方施其破壞性之空襲、克利特陸軍兵工廠使軍隊登陸之船隻、如府島及薩臘米斯史基潑羅之營房、臘利薩之火車站、考林斯運河、考林斯與雅典之軍站、均遭空襲、（三日國際電）　　安加拉　雅典通薩朗尼加之鐵道、前因希臘動員停止商務運輸、現因義機之轟炸、業已完全停頓、查此爲希臘貫通南北之唯一鐵道、希軍之運輸將因而大受阻碍、（三日海通電）　　羅馬　「羅馬人民報」今日刊載義大利空軍在希臘活動之情形稱、外長齊亞諾現已晋級爲義大利空軍中校、彼所指揮之狄斯貝拉達隊、在希臘襲擊薩洛尼卡、有汽油庫兩處及輪船一艘中彈起火、昨日續往薩洛尼卡活動、又有多處中彈起火、此决係由義大利另一隊空軍前往襲擊、所駕飛機爲飛行極速及重軍備之亞爾雪尼飛機、義相公子墨索里尼白魯諾空軍上尉指揮一隊、决公子維托里汰亦在同隊服務、二人在阿比西尼亞戰爭時、迭建功勳、因而成名、（三日海通社電）　　雅典　據昨夜公報、星期五六兩日、義機空襲希臘、結果死九十人、傷二百零九人、皆係平民、傷亡數以薩洛尼加爲最高、計死二十五人、傷八十四人、義機昨向各處亂擬炸彈、柯夫鳥亦被炸、（三日路透社電）希阿邊境一帶　砲戰突然停止　　南國京城　震撼比薩勃區之希阿邊境砲戰、今日　晨、突然停止、名觀察家以爲、義軍已放棄其大規模進攻佛羅林那之計劃、衆料義軍或將退至原陣地、軍行組織、再發動新攻勢、阿境內考爾卡附近、傳大戰正在進行、據自南國邊境傳來消息、英希飛機、曾猛炸阿境內若干軍事中心、又聞惡戰同時在洛錫亞進行、交綏者爲加强之義方山地軍與希臘之精銳山地軍、咋日義軍以步兵及機械化部隊同時進擊、擬奮力擊退勇敢之希人、因希軍驚人之進展、使向佛羅林那前進受阻義軍之兩翼及後方、大受威脅也、今日戰報指稱、潑立斯巴湖南岸戰事最形激烈、雙方死傷數均極重大、自義山地軍一縱隊昨日佔領希臘邊境別克爾村後、戰事卽行展開、據邊境戰報、希軍短兵相接、施行反攻、將義軍逐出邊境、正當希軍奪獲阿爾巴尼亞若干邊境城市之際、義正趕派生力軍赴援、潑利斯巴附近戰事之結果、截止今晨尙未明瞭、（三日國際電）希軍深入阿境　威脅義軍後方　　雅典　向前猛攻之希臘山軍隊中、咋夜猛襲義國侵略者、而使戰局頓改舊觀、蓋希軍業已深入阿爾巴尼亞、而將企圖進攻佛羅立那及薩洛尼加之義軍一縱隊後方、予以嚴重威脅、（三日國際電）　　雅典今日此間希臘官方透露、英戰艦若干艘已駛抵克里特島、希臘高級司令部今日稱、希臘山地軍隊、已深入阿爾巴尼亞、並擊退向薩羅尼加前進之義軍、又傳英戰機已與希臘空軍聯絡、開始作戰、轟炸義國根據地、並保獲希臘中心區、以防義方空襲、自希軍反攻而入阿境六哩後義軍即猛烈還擊、轟炸遠在希軍陣綫後之平民、拜里厄斯·薩維尼加·以及巴特辣斯、昨日皆遭猛炸、（三日國際電）　　南斯拉夫卑多治　據報稱、攻克皮爾基斯泰之希軍、昨日繼續向內地前進、深入阿國達九公里、據稱、希軍進至自弗洛里那至哥爾加之某一據點、希軍此路攻勢、乃在以任何代價、阻止義軍進入弗洛里那、因該地可使義軍摩托化部隊循路前進薩洛尼加也、此外該項攻勢並可截斷柏勒斯派湖與奧克里達湖間之交通、使義軍之接濟不能通行、（三日合衆社電）義報檢討戰略　進攻路綫有三　　米蘭　期丹巴日報本日撰述一文、研討義軍攻擊希臘、如何進展之可能性、其動向有三、（一）攻雅尼那、（二）攻拉利莎、（三）攻福羅利拿及薩洛尼卡、其動機可依决分述之、（一）其目的爲征服愛庇魯斯區、（二）其目的爲進襲雅典、（三）切斷希臘半島與色瑞斯之聯絡、迄今義軍戰報中、僅提及雅尼那之名、但將來義軍行動如何發展、殊難臆斷、（一日海通社電）山區希臘砲隊　憑險轟擊義軍　　雅典　夜間開入比森特里山中積雪高原之希臘砲隊、昨日侵晨卽向科果薩進攻山隘之義摩托化隊轟擊、當希軍防守此山中新陣地之際、希臘空軍亦將轟炸薩洛尼加之意機逐去、雅典之政治情勢、

<p>涇濟專刊匯劃通貨之現狀  張家珂　　　後之匯劃　　匯劃原來是上海錢業通告的一種票據本位，此項票據是隔日付現的，但在不需要兌現的條件下，（卽收入存款戶）則可以當天收入帳戶·匯劃與割頭的分別，原則上匯劃是隔日付現的票據，而劃頭是當天付現的票據，相差是一天的利息，然而在實際，在同一轉帳區域（洋商與華商）內，則匯劃與割頭都可以當天入帳，都等於可以當天付現·所以在戰前，在洋商與華商轉帳的時候，卽在一不同的轉帳領域上，兩者的差殊就分別出來；然而在同一領域內，都等於可兌現的票據，同樣有給付法貨的能力，沒有甚麼分別·因此有人以為匯劃是華商的票據本位，主要的為錢荘：割頭為洋商的票據本位，主要的為洋商銀行，這種解釋也是很合乎事實的。　　匯劃本是一種習慣上的票據通貨，並非法貨，所以一切授受，在從前不論匯劃也好，劃頭也好，只要能夠兌付法貨就是了。但在八一三以後，匯劃在國家法令上已賦予有法償資格。安定金融辦法補充辦法第一條，規定：「鐵錢業所出本票，一律加蓋同業匯劃記，此項票據，祗准在上海同業匯劃，不付法幣及轉購外匯。」等於給與匯劃在上海同業轉帳範圍內以有限法償的資格。此後的匯劃性質，顯然與過去不同。其主要的特點，就是匯劃已是一種封鎖的存款通貨。而此項政令的唯一效用，是在限制資金的向外逃避。　　這時，上海的通貨本位分成兩種，一種是法幣，一種則是不兌法幣，而具有限結償資格的匯劃。其實政府要防止資金逃避，原不必用匯劃制度，因為從滙劃制度可能收穫的封鎖效用是很有限的。况且那時候上海也流行幾萬萬元法幣，法幣轉購外滙旣無限制，縱使握有滙劃者不參加逃避舉動，而這批法幣購買外滙，却已足够影響的了，何况滙劃的本身原是法幣？卽使滙劃不能直接貼換法幣，但是商人把滙劃購買商品，再把商品賣出去，不就在一轉手間變成法幣了嗎？所以在施長初期，在防止市款逃避一方面是有些效用的，但在幾個月，主要的為上海愛成孤島以後，愈是握有存款的人，愈想提存；愈是握有滙劃的人，也愈想換法幣，這樣，流行的滙劃與法幣，因供求懸殊的關係，使兩者間的流通能力與交換價値，都發生差額。　　需要把滙劃換法幣的人，因為法令規定滙劃是「不准兌付法幣」的，所以依正當手續是沒有辦法的，有之自小錢莊的「暗盤」開始·最初每千元滙劃換成法幣，須貼水六七元，逐漸昇高，一度　出二百元關外，這就是滙劃貼水。滙劃貼水在二十七年六月七日，高至七十九元的時候，曾由中，中，交三行委託銀行業聯合準備出而維持，對同業儘量調劑，其貼付價最初是每千元五十元，後來也隨時上落。銀聯此舉，當時曾引起大部份輿論責難，因為這是違反政府「不付法幣」的原則，且與封鎖的原則相反，同時把貼水率公然掛牌，又不啻自己貶低匯劃價値。以事實看，滙劃貼現政策，確實是失販的，因為後來滙劃貼水率的高低，還是聽市價上下，平準者並不能收到如何的功能。　　二　所謂新匯劃　　匯劃封鎖制度，封鎖的目標，為流通籌碼　以及銀行的存款。在相當時期以後，提存的法幣數額旣然增多，資金逃避也愈甚，在資金逃避最厲害的時光，外匯暗市必趨於緊縮，這時，法幣通過了購買外匯關係，也就大量流回國家銀行之手。因此，外匯的緊縮，與匯劃貼水的高漲，幾乎成為同一的趨勢。二十八年六月七日，上海外滙暗市發生索緊縮風潮，資金逃避又入一新階段。財部為了限制資金逃避趨勢計，於是有「馬電」的宣布，規定自六月二十二日起，上海銀錢業支付八一三以後的法幣存款，除發放工資外，每週支款數目，在五百元以內者，照付法幣，超達五百元者，以滙劃支付之。這時市上的人心本來因外匯的突縮，已經很動搖，經此限制，各行莊反而發生提存風潮，而提出的匯劃，又急急乎去換法幣，滙劃貼水漲到二百元，見空前之高價。「馬電」在限止資金逃避方面離然暫時收獲若干效能，但在　般金融狀况來看，並不能减却恐慌。在收縮通貨方面成功了之後，但是為了救濟銀錢業恐慌計又乃不能不採取相反的政策，這就是大家所謂新滙劃。　　新滙劃所採的步驟有二：（一）將原有銀錢業有放在銀錢業準備庫的滙劃存款總額二千二百萬元，由銀行業聯合準備會興中、交、農四行商妥，依據各行莊六月三十餘額，一律按百分之十九十五，（卽照匯劃貼水率五十元計算）於七月四日至九月廿五日止，分十二星期，掉成法幣。（二）各銀錢業得以財產為担保品，領用匯劃，其總額為匯劃五千萬元。此項步聚，賞卽予銀錢業以掉換法幣之便利，也同時解救籌碼缺乏的恐慌，可是因為匯劃可以經貼現手段換成現鈔的關係，所以此項政策實際上等於撤消過去「封鎖」與「緊縮」方針。依學理上言，都不是最好的辦法。　　而目後來滙劃與法幣間長時期的貼水差席，此項新滙劃制度，還應該負一些責任，為什麼呢？本來市上滙劃在長期的水之後，打了一個折扣，都可能變成法幣。那時候法幣與匯劃間的關係，用算式排起業是：「匯劃加劃貼水等於法幣，」所以防磁幣支付，法幣支付的地方用滙劃支付，都是一樣。但是新滙劃發行以後，市塲上旣多出了五千萬元的滙劃頭寸自然加多起來。因此，此後滙劃貼水率，幾乎長期站住在一百元關，本年四月間，目見二百四五十元的新高價。　　滙劃制度的主要力量在封鎖，但是在匯劃可以掉換法幣的原則下，（即可以匯劃貼水）則封鎖的效能早已失去。至於銀行中的存款，因了時日的久遠，安定金融辦法與馬可的限制也早已沒有了。這時匯劃的效用，在主要的市塲上，只有公債還是以匯叫價，其餘只有少數還搭用匯劃，此外都用法幣計數了。　　三　匯劃通貨的現狀　　最近幾個月來，匯劃貼水的市價，一天天下瀉，到了上星期末，滙劃貼水每千元跌到只有三元餘，公債市塲上因為滙劃與劃頭相差不多，也就改用了劃頭計價。自從有滙劃貼水以　，這可以　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　這　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　呢？　　這裏我們行得知道匯劃貼水高下的原則。匯劃與法幣是兩種平行通貨，貼水率的高低，在說明兩者間的供求關係。而匯劃貼水的低下，並不是說匯劃價値的高漲，而是說法幣數量超過需要。　　在匯劃貼水低落期中，我們得指出另一種現象，那就是上海的拆息也趨向於下游。為什麼拆息會趨向下游呢？這就是表示市塲資金的過剩，而造咸資金的過剩，最大的理由，還是外匯的放長，尤其是近遠期市價的平衡。　　資金大量逃避，造成外滙的緊縮，而外匯愈緊縮，則資金逃避愈甚。在這一時期中，因為購買外匯者都需要法幣，而法幣在購買外匯以後都流入銀行，於法幣的籌碼日漸收縮。因了法幣外匯的緊縮，過慮的人又想到法幣會不會變成馬克，所以亟亟將法幣來購買外滙，保藏起來。許多進口商，預計下月份有大宗法幣可以收入，為預防法幣的跌價計，就將法幣先行拋出，購買下月外匯，因之，不但外匯現期收收縮，外匯的遠期也縮。最後因了法幣頭寸之不易得，購買遠期外匯者甚至超過了近期，道樣近遠期的匯價不相去愈遠，也就是遠期比近期更縮。於是所謂「套利」的交易，就這樣起來了，最多的時候，每月可以套到四角，卽合月息百分之四十。法幣在套利上旣有這們多的收入，其價自然抬高，在匯劃方面是貼水的高漲，在利率方面則為拆息的高漲。可是在某種局勢變動下，外匯是看長了，有外滙的人都把外匯賣出來換法幣，法幣的籌碼旣多，而外匯的供方亦多，於是近遠期世就接近起來。因了資金的逃回，法幣又從銀行裏跑出來，把匯　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。　　在平時，法幣與滙劃間本有若干差額，此種差類根　「　劃隔日付現」而發生，卽為一天利息，所以每千不過數角。現在照這個　勢下去，如果外匯再放長，則匯劃貼水當然會再低下，而至於平掉。然而匯劃貼水的低落，旣是根據上述原由，則在上述情勢再見的時候，貼水率還可能向上。　　匯劃通貨在這樣一個現狀下，我們應該討論的，已不是匯劃貼水的問題，也不是法幣如何封鎖問題，而是整個的上海金融管理問題。　　第一，匯劃封鎖制度，到現大證實僅乎是一種可能性的封鎖資金辦法，在一定範圍以外，與一定時間以後，它的可能性是失去了。因此，要封鎖資金的惟一辦法，除了絕封管理匯兌以外，決沒有第二條路。　　第二，上海金融管理人所採取滙劃貼現方針，在原則上是錯誤的，在辦法上也沒有成功。因為匯劃貼水的水滅，只表示匯劃與法幣間可以平掉，而不是表示匯劃悉已封鎖起來。　　第三，匯劃通貨之在今日，因了匯市的　濫，它的不能購買外匯的缺點已經消失，因此得以局漸回復到戰前的滙劃通貨地位。匯劃的主要效能原在封鎖，現在封鎖旣已無可能，則滙劃的本位，為了統一本位計，實已經到了可撤廢的地位。希望財政當局撤消戰後「匯劃」的定義，希望銀鲆業當局以開明的態席撤消匯劃的本位，使本市的籌碼得以統一，而不規則的金融投機買賣目標，可以少一種。　　第四，最後我覺得為了保障今後上海金融市塲的安全，大家對於　今後的流通籌碼問題，　如何杜絕業內外的外匯投機問題，　如何調整上海的資金問題，來商得一個辦法。上海之黃金黑市  遠暉　　一，標金釵投機之沒落　　上海本為投機盛行的都會，「八一三」戰前，以賣買標金為業的金業交易所，尤為投機的集中地。我國產金不多，而我國的貨幣制度，又未採用金本位；經營國際貿易的商人，為收支外滙計，可委託銀行賣買外匯，極少有賣買及輸送黃金的需要，以為國際收支的手段。故上海的金市，投機交易佔其極大多數。且因上海標金籌碼缺乏，賣空買空的投機交易，到了交割之期，勢難以現貨交割，常以外滙強價。但依據結價的外滙，亦時時變動，可分下列五個時期：　　一，第一次大戰前為英鎊結價　　二，大戰時至一七二六年改為日匯結價　　三，一九二六年　後改為英鎊結價　　四，九三一年九月改為美金結價　　五，一九三四年九月九日起改依中央銀行關金掛牌行市結價　　到了一九三五年冬，國民政府實施法幣政策，外滙穏定，法幣的滙價，常在一先令　便士關及美金三十元的水準，投機家失去了掀風作浪的憑藉，標金市價上落極微，金業交易所便生意淸淡，標金投機已趨沒落之途了。　　二，黑市的興趣　　「八一三」戰事發后，上海各交易所，奉令停業。迨戰事西移，上海租界地位，漸形特殊，江浙　帶避難人士，集於孤島內地的資金，亦集中於上海一隅。二十七年春，專營飾金的銀樓金號，為便利流通現金籌碼起見，覺有交易市塲的需要，乃由某銀行職員間桐生等出面，聯絡金銀同業，組織大元銀號於四川路，賣買烚赤，以流通同業間之金融。且因政府實行統制外匯，上海外滙黑市隨而興起，外滙的黑市波動漸大，烚赤的黑市亦隨之而劇烈波動。兼以本市游資雲集，投機盛行，烚赤遂成為投機交易之一。後有證券幫及錢兌　加入，駸成上海最盛的投機市塲。　　交易標的　塲內交易限定為現貨烚赤，應有成色為千分之九九七，視戰前交易的標金成色為千分之九七八為高。　　成交單位　十市兩稱為一條。　　開盤時期　每星期一二四五，每日兩次，上午九時半至十二時，下午二時至四時，星期三辛午無市。　　交易手續　入塲交易之同業須經同業認可，無須繳納保金，亦不互取佣金。惟成交之烚赤，應於翌最開盤前交割，如不交割，須照本日收盤價相同計算，分別解交差金。　　入塲同業　據二十九年九月調查，先後加入市塲者，有下列三十六家：天元，震康，同康，德孚，誠大，裕中，（以上稱銀號）。楊麼和，老磨雲，景　，新天實，費文元，北慶雲，寶成，老鳳詳，福鳳詳，鳳詳和記，老天寶，（以上稱銀樓）。同豐永，生源永，大德成，泰康潤，永豐，永豐餘，天成，萬興，益大，詳與，升大永，仁承，頊豐恒，鑫源，裕泰，信成，（以上稱金號）。調泰，寶康（以上稱錢莊）。　　以上三十六家，均在天元銀號市塲內，可為直接交易者，均有直通電話，隨時報吿市面，其地位約如交易所內之經紀人。尙有經營烚赤交易小錢莊銀號，不下二三百家，則均轉托上述三十六家代理。每條進出，繳付佣金一二元不等。業外人欲經營此投機交易者，可委託此等小錢莊銀號辦理，每條烚赤，須付保證金二百元至一千元。又須付佣金一元至六元。如做多頭，又須貼付利息一分至三分。（因依照市塲規則，交易均為現貨烚赤，顧客所付保證金，祇為預備解付差金之用。如做多頭，必須買進現貨，則第條烚赤價，須由經手之錢莊銀號代　，故顧客又須貼以利息經營此種交易之同業，均以佣金及貼息大宗收入。）　　三，市價的波動　　上海外滙黑市，自二十七年三月發生後，三年來滙價之升降，甚為劇烈，故烚赤黑市，亦隨之而上落　大。二十七年間，美滙由三十元的滙價　降至二十一元，英滙由一先令二便士降至八便士半，烚赤黑市由一千餘元漲至二千元以上，統計全年市價，高低關額達六百六十九專。去年卽二十八年六月間，美滙猛約定縮至十一元，英滙縮至六便士半，烚赤漲于三千元以上。七八月間外滙封美又縮至四元六八七五，對英三便士二五，烚赤漲至四千八百元，九月間因歐戰發生，外滙放長，十一月底財部實施黃金國有政策，金價曾先後兩度下瀉，後仍繼續上升，至四千元以上。統計全年高低差額達二千八百三十二元。本年春，外滙盤旋於美滙六元，英滙四便士左右，金價常在五千元左右。一度曾跌至千〇二十元。迨五月三日外滙又暴縮，美滙縮至四元三一二五，英滙縮至三便士，烚赤價漲至七千二百五十元之最高峯。嗣後因歐戰擴大，德軍侵入荷比，南洋華僑資金，流返上海，外滙放長，金價漸落。至八月間，財部公布商業滙率，由英滙七便士半降為四便半，投機家以為政府貶低法幣價格，於是外滙黑市，復由四便士左右緊至三便七，美滙六元左右縮至五元，金價曾漲至六千四百八十元。至十月間，太平洋風雲險惡外滙又漸放長，金價跌五千三百八十五元，統計高低差額竟達三千二元三十元，足見金價上落的劇烈了　　烚赤市價升降，大致隨外滙黑市為轉移，已如上述。但上海現金籌碼不多，復因黃金輪出，並不自由，故依美國官定金價及美滙來計額烚赤的標準價格，（並不包括運送費用在內）日　式如左：　　X美元　　廿市秤10兩（成色0.997）　　市秤10兩　482.26英厘（Grain）　　480英厘　美金三十五元（　價）　　照此算式，可知上海一條，應合美金三五·五九二九七二元，以美滙價除之，卽得上海舉美國之標金平梖價。　　四，現貨改為期貨　　本年十月初，太平洋風雲日緊，美滙放長，投機烚赤者均盡力拋空，以致市價，自六千四百八十元，慘落至五千四百七十五元，投機家旣拋空達數　條之多，而現金籌碼則非常缺乏，多頭方面十九均有背景，持其雄厚實力，繫欲收進現貨，不願放出割直，以至勢生十月十九日之軋空風潮。外滙與金價背道而馳。美滙由五元八一一五回至八四三七五，金梖却由五千六百八十元漲至五千八百三十元，最高竟近九百元。收盤以後，多頭方面主張未了交易，均須依當日美滙收盤價五元八四三七五折合為五千九百九十元結價了，空頭乃面堅持不允，後乃衷辦法，以當日收盤價五千八百三十元，結價了結。自經此風潮後，同業間尙未聞有擱淺者，不過仍欲現貨交易，勢難　　了。因此停市三天，由天元銀號經理，召集同業會議改組辦法，將烚赤市塲，依照交易方式辦理，名　改為聯易公會。額定入會會員雜紀人為四十家，每家須繳身分保護會二　元，　共八十萬元，由會長潘三省派保管委員五人，負責保管。仍由大元銀號經理章桐生兼任聯易公會經理，負責主持務。至於交易標的，改為期貨烚赤。證金每條四百元，每月交割兩次，如到期不交割，則須掉期，或依滙豐銀行當日九半進口滙票掛牌美酒行市結價。公會內經紀人額，儘原有問業加入，否則再招補充　　本月二十四日聯易公會之期貨交易開市。現上市之牌號，計有下列二十八家，一，天元，二，德孚，三，鑫源，四，詳和，五，同康永，六，恒記，七，成記，八，德成，九，順源，十，新豐，十一，德大，十二，鋮達，十三，大豐，十四，裕與永，十五，益大，十六，萬豐，十七，淤泥潤，十八，合盛，十九，裕泰豐，二十，鼎盛，廿一，仁承永，廿二，明豐，廿三，詳與永，廿四，立泰，廿五，宏慶永，廿六，時和，廿七，煥大，廿八，公大。因原有之銀樓幫十二家，均未加入，故額定經紀人四十名，　水是額。在裏面十看來，市　的改！　，不過是交易的　的，由現貨　未改篇期貨烚赤，但事實上，這次改組的　識，並不如此簡單，因我們如仔細觀察，則今後聯易公會的投機交易，必將妨客國民經濟，視前更甚　　第一，以　的天元市塲交易，雖以投機居多，尙有百分之一二為現貨交易，收解烚赤。在租界尙允許銀樓公開賣買飾金的塲合，尙不失為週轉該的金融的作用。但改組為期貨市塲，　樓幫全體退出後，至交割時，可外滙結價，則將來聯易市塲交易，勢必為純粹投機交易，絕無現金收解；而交易旣無現貨籌碼的限制，將來市價的上落，必視前更為劇烈。　　第一，今日租界在國際維持之下，方有此違背國家法令的黑市發生，而日方正欲利用此種黑市，以為礦壞法幣制度，以及吸收資金的手段，這次改組以後，日方的魔手，已公然伸入烚赤黑市，無可否認，則今後操縱此黑市者為誰，對於我國國民經濟，將發生何等重大的影響，也不難推知了。商業新聞金融述評  聖凱瓊　　十一月二日　　公債上升的原因（續）　　要研究在這時間內公債高漲的原因，先要知道這時間內的經濟環境變遷。按自德·義·日三國軍事經濟同盟簽訂以來，國際局勢的展開非常有利於中國前途，因之中國國家的經濟環境也隨之而發生轉變。顯著事實：先是九月二十六日美國官方文吿美國以二千五百萬元借給中國，以維持中國外匯上的需要，並稱美國決定向中國資源員會購買價値三千萬元的鎗砂。繼之以英國覺司「助紂為虐」之非，放棄在遠東方面的綏靖政策，以十月十八日的開放滇緬公路來響應美國的貨款援華，俾供應需要資源與經濟建設材料的輸入中國，中國的資源可輸往國外。其後十月十入日傳美國將再貨巨款給予中國，正由聯邦貨款行政官瓊斯與中國銀行董事長宋子文氏在會商中。因為中國　　經濟，得這多助，力量加强，致使一般在投機市塲滚進滚出的資金所有者，發生一種還是法幣是最娥固的資財底正理。同時投機市塲中的外匯在放長，外股在跌落，投機非但無利可圖，且將遭到損失，則與其投機而有害，何如投資而有利！於是轉回有一分以上投資利益的公債進攻何况勝利的鐵券已為中國所握持，乘債市尙在低價之時收，則其投資利益愈多，故在短短的兩個月中，行市的飛升，高價的甲乙兩種在十分之一以上，而低價的丙丁戊三種則達白分之十三。匯劃貼現的將來　　滙劃票據貼水行市自在黑外匯無直接關係，但是因保有匯無直接關係，但是因保有匯劃資金者，在匯市趨縮時要想貼水掉現扒結外滙，行市的變動，遂以外匯的變動為歸依。此項變動詳細統計，請參閱The　Central　Bank　Of　China　Bulletin，1939　P.257.經本年的事例來說，在「五二」滙市大變動時，貼水高到二百五十元　，其後匯市放長，貼水遂也小六十　。最近十月份組在廿元以內盤旋，而自二十六日起更進十元關，十一月日又見四元的最低行市，回復到二十六年底左右情形。下面是二十九年五月至十月的六個月的統計：（按分月週為單位，十月份　低為五元半）　　匯劃貼水行市在大難以外匯為繩準，但是因為公債是以滙劃票據而賣買，故因買賣公債時，由於匯劃票據的供求，行市的變化，更受供求率的支配。換言之，在外滙小＝平穏無變或鬆動的情况下，因匯劃籌碼的需要大，則貼水行市趨低，反之，需要小或竟不需要，則貼水行市趨高或穏定。最近公債因各方吸收，對於滙劃籌碼的需要多，以故平均價由四十五元餘而二十七，復落為十三元。　　在大量匯劃籌碼，轉化為公債之後，致使公債的買賣，匯劃籌碼，供應不敷需要，而於十一月日改為劃頭買賣。一般人頗多認為滙劃貼水勢將銷滅，在政府法令取締之下，當然希望確能如引，但在事實上，恐怕尙難辦到，目前匯劃籌碼的不敷需要，是因為轉為公情，並未消滅，最後的歸突，是退在國家銀行的握持中，公債還本付息仍用匯革，各埠匯到上海的滙款，亦有一部份支付匯劃，退藏在國家銀行的滙劃籌碼，慢慢地仍會流通到市塲上去。故在目前滙劃貼水的趨勢，恐仍在當前的水準上盤旋，旣難趨高，亦不趨低。將來的變化，還視將來金融情况化而轉移。海蜇產量减色　　海蜇本年以產量不豐、約及十分之三四、故來源至稀、查市間底存經陸續出銷、已深感缺乏、而蜇皮更尠、因是逐步上漲、查售價目六十元竟升至一百十元、蜇頭帶高、亦須七十五元矣、薄素嗶嘰市銷大减　　昨日呢羢雖未出到交割、而現貨成交仍盛、冬銷大衣呢。絡駝羢。中厚花呢。平厚呢等、咸有零躉一出、薄素嗶嘰、不論元藏灰駝顏色、市銷大减、批發因客路不通、多皆停止、本街門莊零剪生意、較往年莫不大見减遜、按嗶嘰初多船上幫所旺銷、現在輪船行駛大减、去胃殊薄、又銅鐵水木作塲幫亦多指做薄素嗶嘰為衣褲、刻則日常生活費用高漲、嗶嘰行情昂貴、咸多乏力添購、普通因同是三元餘一尺代價、現多改剪其他花色貨矣、以致邇來廠方有鑒於斯、素畢嘰出品悉多减少、昨章華薄素嗶嘰、每碼現批售十一元半、大光明蜜豐牌子售十二元七角半、草綠草黃加價五角、怡和啤酒股　開拍第一週　成交額三八萬餘股　自八元降至七元四角　　英商怡和啤酒公司召墓新股、爭購者之踴躍、超過召額八倍、已詳本報、聞此次認購者、大部份為「搶帽子」者博得微利、卽行出售、自十月二十八日起、由衆業公所正式拍板、開拍價為八元、十一月日曾降至七元一角半、至收盤價為七元四角、開拍後第一天成交達十七萬六千股、一星期內成交總額為三十八萬二千八百股、白鉛皮不動　　久無動靜之白鉛皮市面、近來依然未見有動態、因電池廠吸胃減弱、（蓋規模較大之幾家已遷往內地營業也）兼之烟津靑以秦皇島諸幫客商去化全無市况岑寂、行情徘徊、刻如二號每桶售一千二百元、三四號一千一百五十元、五六號一千零五十元、七八號一千一百元、九號一千一百五十元、十號一千一百元、十一號一千二百元、十二號至十八號則每桶沽一千三百元、至一千四百元不等、較前市不分榮辱耳、會司鐵銷路復活　　會司鐵有新老銅廠之分、每臬二百磅裝、本街工廠用戶如印鐵廠製罐廠烟公司及熱水瓶玩具等廠納胃頗殷、前昨交易達五六百箱之巨、此外江浙內河客商亦有搜辦、故市象大有復活之氣、致人心亦覺挺秀、行盤隨見帶高、刻每箱沽一百八十元及一百七十元兩種、查海外定價昂貴、計合國幣每箱須二百元、故同業心思異常蓬勃、來市趨勢與行情、勢在必好、市價　二十九年十一月三日星期六　金融　　海外各國五匯（二日電）　　英謝與　四元〇二分中　　英封英　四元〇三分七五　　英謝　四辦士一三　　　　滬　六元二角二分　　英討日　一元會二辦士半　　美劃日　廿三元四角八分證券　　紐約股票　二日紐約電·今日設市於沉寂市面中漲落互見。響營者豐於大遷在即·故審愼而不願做交易。　　橡皮　　二日紐約電·據皮市呆　無　彩·操樂者猶豫。雜糧　美麥　　二日工芝加哥電·廠家購買與空戶抵補·半被浮多了結所抵銷。兩性衛生中年腎虧腦弱的  合理調攝及效療法　　中年人何故會發生腎虧腦弱等症呢？一言以蔽之，此由於靑春時代的過度消耗精血所致。靑春時代若縱慾荒淫，或染有手淫惡癖者，則一到中年上述兩症，無法避免。此外環境不良，用腦過度，努動過烈，則體力之消耗亦鉅，至中年後，也會發生上述二症，治療之法，羰在合理的調攝，切勿氣操勞過度，房事亦宜節制，攝取富有滋養料的食品，注意運動，勿吸煙酒等品。然後再從事於增精補血療法，方能達到返老還童恢復靑活力的目的　　關於中年人患腎虧腦弱之症，確屬未老先衰所致，對症之治法，必須服以德國梅倫博士所發明之雄壯動特內份泌製劑男用「補體康」，蓋「補體康」完全從猩猩，牛羊，特鹿，海狗的睪丸中提出其精質所製成，假設因操過度，或荒淫斷傷致患腎虧腦弱等症，而股以「補體康」之後，立感性力繁榮，遺精滑精，早洩陰痿，腰痠背痛等症，指日可愈。　　「補体康」之成分除獸類之畢丸精質之外，並有補腦之粦質，補血之鐵質，補骨的鈣質摻入，凡對於身體任何一部的表弱均可治愈。年未過四十之人，若感精神不足，面色蒼白，神經衰弱，肌肉削瘦，辦事乏力，即為早衰的明症，則內服「補體康」實為最合理的療法，其女用有調經種了之功，治貧血早衰尤為討症。遺精須戒煙酒  德國醫學　博士鄭霆　　患者趙菊明，無錫人，年廿二歲，（自訴）——自幼身體甚好，性好色，嗜煙酒，並喜閱淫書淫畫及春宮照片，故犯手淫之惡習，性慾衝衝動時，每以玩弄性具，以達射精之目的，三四年來未曾間斷，具好嗜煙酒，每日須煙二包之多，飯酒則非醉不可，由是身體大損，半年以來，每有　精，且次數由少而多，由夢遺而無夢而遺，雖立意戒絕，奈習慣已成，仍不時犯之，後經醫師診治，服棄並令戒除煙酒，不一月這精已無，後因煙癖發作，乃從復吸飯，不料遺精亦隨之而來！今見報！特來求治云云（治愈經過）——因煙酒能剌戰神經，故令其絕對戒除，此外令其服用「耐而斯遺精片」每晚三片，並德國男用「補體康」，趙君遵言面行，不二月，體重增中十五磅，遺精已根治，健康已完全恢復。白濁療法之新實騐  德國醫學博士王克春　　許多籌時之梅病療法，旣經現代專家醫師，及病家證明其無效，故新療法之研究，甚囂於整個醫學界中，學者理頭工作，耗舅無數心血與腦汁，座由試騐管中，發見一治淋眞理，而一時震撼全世界的醫壇。咸認為治療淋病上最大之收穫。舉以其溫文而具强力殺菌之化學藥品，製為溶液，取以浸染梅菌，則見淋菌迅即死亡。　　彼德博士，於百尺竽頭，更進一步，乃取純凈黃色素及特製蛋白體等，用精密之消毒手續，製為內服劑「克淋儂」（中英大藥房有售）從此淋病之治療遂開一新天地。　　凡是男女急慢性中之淋病，如男子之急慢性　頭炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎，女子之陰門炎，陰道炎，子宮炎，卵巢炎，淋毒性白帶等，本藥均有根治之功能。其成效之迅速與正確，久已口碑載道，若女子淋毒性白帶，可一方外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，每晚於臨睡前取一片插入　道，次晨洗去即得。男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明害洗條尿道，在家秘密自療，則見效之速，尤能出人意表。肺病氣逆現象  盛在强醫師　　肺病患者如有氣逆現象發現，則病勢有相當之危險，無疑已入第三期肺病，有吐血者更現嚴重，故患者絕不可忽略，但依余經騐所知，只要患者能靜養，攝取富有營養物，並加以藥物之治療，無有不奏起殺回生之功效者，　　最近有患者曾天源者，年二十四歲，無錫人，患肺病已有二年有餘，雖已週服各中西藥，而絕然無效，去秋由朋友介紹來余處醫治，經用X光檢查之後，已發現肺部有大小空洞各一，已氣逆甚劇，盜汗甚多，病勢為危篤，乃令服「補肺拿爾」並令攝養，三個月後病勢已去大半，再服三月而愈。</p>

<p>春秋當物十五天爲滿  蕭亢石　　自從上海淪爲「孤島」之後，種種的「黑幕」，日增月異地發生着，尤其是其他的「黑暗」，不絕地滋長，那一件不是使人發生着憾慨呢！　　南市「開放」以來，賭塲和烟館林立，在烟賭的兩種不正當勾當盛行之下，而其他一切不正當的營業，也隨之而興；像在睹塲的附近，必有許多爿做買賣當票或抵押當票的店家，無疑地，這勾當又是脫胎於「滬西」的！　　講到這許多爿做買賣當票或抵押當票的店家，它們能够抓着一般的賭徒的心理，開設在賭塲的附近以便賭徒們在賭輸了的時候，視爲方便之門，得以再到賭塲中去「孤注擲」，而同時一般脊小，也可以得到了銷售贓物的唯一好地方。（按公共租界和法租界對於以當票爲營業者，嘗於數月前共同出示佈告，嚴厲取締亦案。）　　現在南市一般營業當票的店家，非但收押當票，買賣當票，抑且在暗下私押物件，押期「十五天爲滿」，眞是一霎眼卽行沒掉，可見其手段的狠辣。雖然到了期限，可以轉票一期，但它們的取利，每塊錢要三分，存箱也要三分，那麽半個月的利息是六分，把票子再轉延一次，又要加上六分，這一塊錢的利息，一個月就要一角二分了。　　不過這班當戶，爲什麽不到正式的當押中去典質，偏要到營業當票的店家去通商，實因營業當票的店家，就在賭塲的隔壁，並且深夜也可質錢，賭徒們「飲鳩止渴，枉顧「重利盤剝」，和短期爲滿苛刻的條例，咎固應得：但是其間有不少貧民，不知其中的黑幕，跑到迨種黑店中去質錢，那就不堪設想了！天！解答難產的一封信  無庸　　（讀難產·簽字·醫師的責任後）　　人的生命，在乎一呼吸之間，聽到醫家的談論，越覺得生死之不能一定，因爲人的生理上，本伏有無數猝死的機會，常人不知，委諸命運。但是吾人對於生命，是非常尊重的，所人「人如何死」的一點，尤其注意。　　讀十月三十日載陳憐君的「難產·簽字·醫師的責任」一文，不覺怦然有動於心，以爲陳君所受的傷痛，是人人爲之惋惜的。因此把這問題，質諸瞿紹衡醫師、瞿醫師誠懇地起而作答道：醫有割股之心，除別有容心，不顧醫界道德者外，敢說沒有不盡心竭力，以診治病人的，鄙人（瞿醫師自稱）行醫三十年，雖旁治其他疾病外，對於產婦人科，悉力攻硏，因此來治者衆，所遇的困難，有出於意料之外者。前年上海市醫師公會爲承的申報新醫與新藥」週刋，囑爲撰文，遂以「慈善與法律」爲題（文載民國二十七年一月十日申報），內引兩件事實：　　（一）去年某月日，有男女二人，因女臨產，來院投住，當由男子簽立住院保單，繳納院費而去。不意產婦入夜劇痛，至午夜忽起變化，勢非施行手術不可‘乃令院役就保單地址，邀其男人，詎知該處並無其人，情勢益危。余無奈，乃往街頭招一安南捕，告以情，請爲證。　　（二）今年（民國二十七年）十二月某日，有某婦，深夜隻身來院，叩門甚急，甫入門，其狀非常狼狽，嗚嗚不能言，腹痛不能止，腰屈不能支，卽令院役抬入產室，啟褲視之，則兒頭已露其頂矣。　　此情此景，試問誰與辦理法律上之手續，拒之乎？則一髮之繫，生死所關，不但爲人情所不可能，亦爲良心，所不能許，幸得兩全，可告無事。至謂產婦之病症，有突起者甚多，余亦曾撰「分娩時母體及胎兒自身之死亡原因」（刋民國二十八年五月三十日及六月六日「新醫與新藥」）其中列舉失血，腦貧血，肺水腫，心臟破裂及麻庫，空氣栓塞，震盪，窒息，急性中毒，敗血症等等。因爲人之身體，芷如一部機器，機器之任何一部，發生障碍或損壞，立可停止轉動。况懷孕產婦之氣體，恒弱於平時，偶爾突起變化，確有爲醫師所不能預料者；如陳君所云，其夫人當時究竟如何發生變化，固非吾人所能臆測，但就醫學病理上講來，殊有突發變化之可能。不知爲之主治之醫師，曾吾將經過及醫學上之病理，詳爲說明，俾家屬頓釋疑團。因爲病家對於醫師，往往因隔　而發生誤會，因誤會而發生疑慮，這不但家屬之心不安，並且影響於醫界之名譽。承下問，故不避煩瑣而詳說之。余以瞿醫師之言極懇切而有理，特筆而錄之，以寄本刊，倘能公諸報端，庶陳君資以參閱，一般社會，亦可明白了。余更欲爲一般社會進者，請醫有幾個條件：　　（一）有道德的。　　（二）有經騐的。　　（三）愛惜名譽的。　　（四）最好由熟人介紹知其確能具備上開條件的。　　陳憐君的「難產·簽字，醫師的責任」一文，大的有感而發，在病家傷心之餘，發此意見，亦人情之常，余意對於此文，如欲發表意見，應用解釋之態度，使一般社會明瞭醫家之困難，則疑團盡釋，誤會全消矣。街頭  幼人　　許多車輛狂奔過去，但小見塵土飛揚，追追追，一輛汽車，一輛電車，坐人力車的，走路的，拉車的，討飯的，高樓大厦的銀行，放收音機的百貨商店，擺攤兒的，担担兒的，賣報的……一階階，一層層，包括了全市各色人等：喜，樂，悲，哀，安適，苦痛，黑暗，光明。　　幸福的人在沉醉，流浪的人在徘徊，鄉下人在驚歎，有的人想吃人，有的入在等着讓人吃。霍桑探案舞后的歸宿  程小靑著　　第十章　皮革問題　　那黑牌汽車在靑蒲路二十七號停住。趙伯雄叫朱福慶讓汽車向西繼續進行，並不一同停留，不過速率却特別慢。一回兒，汽車駛過了兩三條支路，趙伯離又吩咐回過來，停在靑蒲路三十一號的門前。這時雨下得很大，那黑牌汽車已開去了。趙伯離却冒雨下車，悄悄地去到十十七號六外去。朱福　瞧見他並不曾進去，却站在短牆外面，向裏面張望。這張望的時間延長一一刻鐘光景，朱福慶始終坐在汽車裏等候，有些兒覺得不耐。他忽見趙伯雄從二十七號的短牆邊向西退避，先在隔壁的空地那邊躱一躱；隨卽又回到短牆邊去，向屋子裏張望了一下，接着就奔向停着的汽車去。　　當趙伯雄在空地上躱避的時候，朱福慶在汽車中瞧見有一個身材短小穿西裝雨衣的男子，從一十七號裏出來，向東四大同路那面轉角走去，等到趙伯雄趕回進了汽車，馬上叫朱福　開車，駛過了二十七號，到大同路轉灣向北，意思要追蹤前面一輛汽車。朱福慶才知道那個穿雨衣的人，本來也是有汽車停在大同路上的，不過經過了趙伯雄重新回到短牆外面去瞧一瞧，時間上已略略有些耽擱。故而朱福慶的汽車駛進大同路時，那個穿雨衣人所坐的汽車駛得已相當遠。朱福慶雖開足速率，駛過了兩條支路，但因着前面汽車的速率同樣加快，不但沒有追上，連前而那輛汽車的顏色都辦別不淸。在駛進第三條支路口時，因着等候支路上的汽車駛過，又停頓了一下，等到再開車前進，前面那輛汽車已不見影踪。趙伯雄仍叫朱福慶拼命追趕，可是到底沒有結果。於是又駛過了幾條馬路，祇得停止追趕。汽車重新退回到靑蒲路，照樣停在三十一號門前。趙伯雄又一度下車，依舊悄悄地走到二十七號屋裏去。朱福慶以爲這一次又有相當時問的耽擱，正打算模出紙烟來蘇散一下。不料砰的一聲，連他的紙烟都沒有燒着。他忽見趙伯雄倉皇地奔回汽車去。朱福慶不知道是趙伯雄開槍打人，還是有人開槍打趙伯雄。他當然也不便查問。不過趙伯雄上車以後，拿了兩張十元的法幣，塞在朱福慶的手裏，此外沒有一句說話，祇叫他開回亞東旅館去。　　報吿到這裏爲止，霍桑和倪金　看過以後，當然大家都很重視。倪金壽的意思還嫌不很淸楚，建議說：「這是間接的，不够淸楚。我想叫虎林去把那個司機朱福慶找來，直接地問一問。」　（一五五）</p>

<p>Editorial: Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>A perusal of recent Japanese statements reveals a near-unanimous acknowledgment of the myriad obstacles facing the so-called "construction of a new order in East Asia" and a deep awareness of the difficulties that lie ahead for Japan. Had the Japanese possessed such awareness earlier, the Pacific crisis might not have escalated to its current severity. Japan could have avoided its present predicament and even capitalized on the European conflict to usher in a new golden age. Unfortunately, Japan has created irreparable errors.</p>
<p>The root causes of Japan's political, military, and diplomatic failures lie in its underestimation of its adversaries and its short-sightedness. Its underestimation of others led to reckless adventurism, fueled by the illusion that it would encounter minimal resistance. Its short-sightedness prevented it from accurately assessing situations, resulting in actions that yielded outcomes contrary to expectations. For the past decade, whether in its war of aggression against China or its dealings with foreign powers, Japan has consistently committed these two fundamental blunders. Even when it occasionally displays some understanding, it is often after encountering setbacks. The major errors it has made, however, are rarely corrected. The recent evolution of Sino-Japanese relations powerfully illustrates this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In its perception, Japan has consistently viewed Great Britain in the Far East as its immediate adversary. Exploiting Britain's perilous position and clinging to the unchanging nature of its appeasement policies, Japan has persistently fantasized about forcing Britain into submission, believing that doing so would pave the way for the fulfillment of its grand ambitions. Towards the United States, however, it has maintained a respectful distance, privately assuming that as long as it could secure Britain's acquiescence, it could afford to disregard the United States. Despite the fact that for nine years, the United States had unveiled the doctrine of non-recognition in the Far East, delivered a stern warning to Japan in a speech by Grew in 1938, and cancelled commercial treaties with Japan, which consistently demonstrates the firmness and consistency of the US Far East policy, Japan has always believed that America's caution is merely a disguised form of cowardice, and it is permissable to deceive them. The fact that America is across the ocean to wage war on Japan has always seemed inconceivable. As France fell and America became concerned for its own security, this sentiment became even more pronounced. Japan openly included the territories of various countries in the South Seas into the sphere of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It declared that it would no longer adopt a conciliatory approach towards the United States and even further colluded with Germany and Italy to threaten America. Konoe and Matsuoka once issued threats to the United States, not hesitating to go to war, and the anti-American movement rose accordingly. This situation developed to its highest peak a month ago. But it was not that Japan was really sure of defeating the United States, but only that it estimated that while the war on the European continent was in full swing, the United States might only make empty high-profile statements to Japan due to the threat from the Atlantic and the constraints of the election issue. However, the result was obviously the opposite. The US response was not compromise and concession, but embargoes, military expansion, preparations, evacuation of僑民, and increased aid to China. The Japanese authorities' attitude changed 180 degrees from the day the US turned tough, engaging in various defenses and explanations. It even stated, regardless of how Germany and Italy felt, that the Three-Nation Alliance was not aimed at the United States. When war broke out between Italy and Greece, it tried to evade its mutual aid obligations. This attitude was brought to the extreme by Matsuoka and Suma of the Kasumigaseki authorities. Recently, due to the recall of Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi, he once intended to replace him with General Kobayashi, who was "pro-American" and "opposed to the Tripartite Alliance," and return to the old tune of Abe and Nomura. However, the task of adjusting US-Japanese relations is different from a year ago. According to Tokyo news yesterday, Matsuoka consulted many people in the diplomatic community, but no one was willing to accept the position of US ambassador because it was extremely difficult to please the US in the current situation. Tokyo people said they hoped that the US would not doubt Japan's dissatisfaction with the US because the envoy had been suspended for a long time. This type of phenomenon is very different from Matsuoka's style of advocating for innovative diplomacy, and it is very different from his attitude a month ago, but these are all confirmed facts.</p>
<p>American domestic and foreign policies have always been calm and firm, which is very different from Japan's wavering and changeableness. The Japanese side once explained the recent tough attitude of the United States as a gesture during the election process. If so, then why is the Japanese side so careful in seeking to ease the situation? It can be seen that this is just a self-consoling rhetoric. Japan is very clear that the United States' foreign policy will not change due to the election. The recent Japanese public opinion has fully demonstrated the general panic.</p>
<p>However, this situation cannot be regarded as Japan intending to repent. At most, it is just self-alerting and expecting something in an increasingly difficult environment. Because it is always very unwise for today's Japan to rashly challenge the United States. The disparity in military and economic strength, the constraints of the war against China, and the stalemate in Soviet-Japanese diplomacy are all major weaknesses of the Japanese side. Recently, the extreme moderation of the Japanese authorities' attitude towards the United States, if it is not hoping that the US's firm policy will tend to relax - this possibility is extremely small - then at least it is to delay time, so as to complete the economic exploitation of the Asian continent and the South Seas, the reduction and even the end of the war against China, and the success of the negotiations with the Soviet Union. These attempts are now being carried out in different ways. They are cooperating with the moderate appearance of Matsuoka and Suma. In addition, the development of the European war situation is also an important factor. The recent support of Germany and Italy has undoubtedly depreciated the courage of the Japanese consortium. If Germany and Italy quickly gain the upper hand, it will also be another impulse for the Japanese side to engage in adventure.</p>
<p>Although recent Japanese public opinion has been able to recognize the seriousness of its own situation, before it can overcome the power of the radical faction, its conclusion must not be to rein in at the precipice, but to step up preparations. Look at the Kokumin Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the military, which has not changed its consistent hard-line position on the United States, and has never criticized Matsuoka's moderate diplomacy. Obviously, this is another masterpiece of the two-sided policy. Matsuoka's personality is slightly different from that of Shiratori, but he will not suddenly become a follower of the Shidehara line because of the attack by the American big stick. It is not difficult to learn the outline of the future of US-Japanese relations from this main tone of the Japanese side.</p>
<p>British Naval Minister Announces British Troops Land in Greece, Air Force Assists Greek Troops, Italian Troops Advance towards Kalabaka</p>
<p>London: British Naval Minister Alexander announced via broadcast that British troops have landed in Greece, and that the navy there is now receiving air support. This marks the first official announcement of British troop landings in Greece. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The British Naval Chief broadcast a speech this morning stating that Britain has urgently dispatched an expeditionary fleet and aircraft to Greece. His speech included the phrase, "We do not break our oath to Greece. The British Navy is there, and the Air Force is also going to assist. Military targets in Naples have long been bombed by British aircraft. British troops have landed in Greece, and we will do our best to build the road to victory for the Axis powers." During his speech, the Naval Chief also challenged Mussolini, asking him to send the Italian fleet to the Mediterranean to engage the British Navy in a decisive battle. The Naval Chief also hinted that the 50 aging destroyers newly obtained from the United States are indeed a major factor in enabling Britain to strengthen its Mediterranean fleet. (3rd International Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: An official announcement was made yesterday, stating that Italian troops have passed through Ioannina on their way to Greece.

<p>Southern Border of Ochrida: Fierce fighting raged between Greek and Italian troops yesterday along two river fronts. Italian forces have erected pontoon bridges and crossed the Kalamas River. However, another Italian attempt to cross the Bistrica River was repulsed. The Italian troops that crossed the Kalamas River are reportedly advancing along the Kalamas River Valley towards Ioannina. Greek bombers dropped bombs on concentrations of Italian troops in the village of Rotani, where the Italians crossed the river. It is also reported that Italian troops crossed into Greece in the Korce area on Friday night, but Greek aircraft quickly destroyed a bridge over the Bistrica River, and the Italian invasion into Greece was thwarted, but it is said that the Italian troops are still trying to cross the river. The Italian forces are now apparently planning a large-scale attack on Kastoria, which is a crossroads, connecting Florina and Thessaloniki to the north and Laiptosista to the south, which is a key military point.

<p>Artillery Battle Suddenly Ceases along the Greek-Albanian Border</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The artillery battle on the Greek-Albanian border, which shook the Pissabo region, suddenly ceased this morning. Observers believe that the Italian army has abandoned its plan for a large-scale offensive against Florina. It is expected that the Italian army will retreat to its original positions, reorganize its military, and launch a new offensive. There are reports of fierce fighting near Korkal in Albania. News from the Yugoslav border reports that British and Greek aircraft have heavily bombed several military centers in Albania. There are also reports of fierce battles taking place in Losia, with intensified Italian mountain troops clashing with elite Greek mountain troops. Yesterday, the Italian army launched simultaneous attacks with infantry and mechanized units, attempting to forcefully repel the brave Greeks. The amazing progress of the Greek army has hindered the advance on Florina and has greatly threatened the flanks and rear of the Italian army. Today's battle reports indicate that the fighting is most intense on the south bank of Lake Prespa. The number of casualties on both sides is extremely high. The war was launched yesterday after a column of Italian mountain troops occupied the Greek border village of Bekel. According to border battle reports, Greek troops engaged in close combat and launched a counterattack, driving the Italian troops out of the border. While Greek troops were capturing several border cities in Albania, Italy was rushing reinforcements to aid them. The outcome of the battle near Pellisba has not been clarified as of this morning.

<p>Greek Troops Advance Deep into Albania, Threatening Italian Forces' Rear</p>
<p>Athens: Greek mountain troops, who were fiercely attacking, launched a fierce attack on Italian invaders last night, and the war situation suddenly changed its old appearance. The Greek army has now penetrated deep into Albania, posing a serious threat to the rear of the column of Italian troops attempting to attack Florina and Thessaloniki. (3rd International Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: Today, Greek officials here revealed that several British warships have arrived at Crete. The Greek High Command today stated that Greek mountain troops have penetrated deep into Albania and repulsed Italian troops advancing on Thessaloniki. It is also reported that British fighter planes have contacted the Greek air force and started fighting, bombing Italian bases and protecting the Greek central region to prevent Italian air raids. After the Greek army counterattacked and entered Albania for six miles, the Italian army launched a fierce counterattack, bombing civilians far behind the Greek front line. Piraeus, Saviniga, and Patras were all heavily bombed yesterday. (3rd International Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bitola, Yugoslavia: It is reported that the Greek troops who conquered Pirkestai continued to advance into the interior yesterday, penetrating nine kilometers into Albania. It is said that the Greek troops advanced to a stronghold from Florina to Korca. The Greek offensive is aimed at stopping the Italian army from entering Florina at any cost, because the area would allow the Italian motorized troops to advance along the road to Thessaloniki. In addition, the offensive can cut off traffic between the lakes of Berles and Ochrida, thus prevent Italian supplies from getting through. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Review Strategy; Three Possible Routes of Attack</p>
<p>Milan: "Il Tempo" newspaper published an article today discussing the possibility of how the Italian army's attack on Greece will progress. There are three possible directions: (1) Attack Ioannina, (2) Attack Larissa, (3) Attack Florina and Thessaloniki. Its motives can be described separately. (1) Its purpose is to conquer the Epirus region. (2) Its purpose is to attack Athens. (3) Cut off the connection between the Greek peninsula and Ceres. So far, only the name Ioannina has been mentioned in Italian military reports, but it is difficult to speculate on how Italian military actions will develop in the future. (1st Huitong Agency)</p>
<p>Greek Artillery Positions in the Mountains Bombard Italian Forces from Risky Heights</p>
<p>Athens: Greek artillery positions, which had opened up into the snowy highlands in the Visenteri Mountains at night, started bombarding the Italian mechanized troops approaching mountain passes at dawn yesterday. While the Greek army defended new positions in these mountains, Greek Air Force also drove back any Italian aircraft that intended to bomb Thessaloniki. The political situation in Athens has been showing significant developments. Military officials here are very excited about rumors regarding British ships arriving at Crete and the rapid preparation of naval and air bases there. The capture of Visenteri Mountain by the Greek army came as a great surprise to the Italian army, which had admitted to the route up the mountain being difficult and dangerous to take. The way in which the Greek engineers enabled the army to ascend it has been described as shockingly remarkable. Both army personnel and heavy artillery have been hauled up and down the mountain on rope slings in baskets not unlike life preservers, as if they were cargo being lifted by cranes. Deep mountain caves serve as natural air raid shelters, so the effect of Italian aircraft attacks against Greek troops yesterday afternoon was limited. As the Italian army launched a fierce counterattack, intending to reclaim the important ground, Greek army had already stationed troops within it. National mobilization in Greece was completed yesterday, with many Greek men departing for the front lines. The Greek army, under the command of General Gambias, will soon launch a fierce counteroffensive on Korce. As Greece consolidates its forces to resist the invasion, the Greek High Command is already in consultation with British naval and air experts to prepare for a winter war. It is said that the naval bases of Greece have been occupied by allied fleets. Authoritative sources have reported that naval and air actions to attack the Dodecanese Islands are imminent. Yesterday afternoon, an Italian hydroplane attacked Central Fleet, but was repulsed. The Greek mainland and its islands have swiftly become naval and air bases against the Italians, but although the progress of the Italian army has been blocked, the offensive by the Italian Air Force has intensified. Corfu has been cruelly bombed by Italian aircraft. The first report from the island says that eight civilians have been bombed to death and twenty have been injured. In Khandia, ten have been bombed to death and twenty have been injured. Patras has been bombed again, resulting in multiple fires. However, it is said that the deaths and injuries are lighter than before because people have been able to quickly retreat into air raid shelters. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Greek Determination to Resist Exceeded German and Italian Expectations</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that the reason why Italy has not put all its efforts into attacking Greece is that they did not initially expect the Greek people to unite in resistance. They are still hoping to use German aid and schemes to achieve results without fighting. Now the arguments in German and Italian newspapers suggest that this statement is not without reason. Several Italian newspapers are arguing strongly that there is no deep-seated hatred between the Italian and Greek peoples, but that the Greek leaders were seduced and confused, failing to see the benefits of cooperation with the Axis powers. It is clear that Italy has been preparing for war against Greece for several months. They have not only concentrated large armies in Albania and stockpiled military supplies to avoid the transportation dangers of crossing the Otranto Strait, but also built roads throughout Albania to reach the Albanian border. What is the reason for the lack of rapid progress in the war against Greece, despite such long preparations? It is difficult to understand. The Italian side is using bad weather as the only excuse for the slow progress, but the mountainous areas of Epirus etc. have never had marshes that cannot be moved forward. Although there are no good roads, the land is dry and would not hinder the march of the army even after rain. It is something that dictatorships cannot understand that the people of small countries love freedom so much that they are willing to sacrifice everything. The unity and patriotism of the Greek people seem to have exceeded the expectations of Germany and Italy. Although there are rumors that Hitler and Mussolini do not entirely agree on the invasion of Greece, judging from previous events, Italy must have made arrangements in advance and would never have launched it hastily without being sure. It is said that the Italian army's offensive against Greece is a feint to induce the Central State to go to war or to induce the Turkish state to move troops from Thrace to help Greece. If the Italian tactics really have this strategy, then what they planned is just like what they guessed, that Greece will surely be at their mercy, and they will both fail. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>British Air Force Heavily Bombs Berlin Station, Dropping Many Tons of Bombs Causing Large Fires, Naples, Italy, Also Attacked</p>
<p>London: On Friday night, the British Air Force launched an extremely heavy concentrated attack on Berlin. When the British planes returned, they saw fires burning in Berlin for a mile, and the flames were still raging 150 miles away through the clouds. British planes repeatedly dropped heavy high-explosive bombs on Berlin stations and railway traffic, including three important railway centers, hitting targets and destroying them. Several places caught fire, and the fire was more intense than the British planes had ever seen in Germany. The first attack on Berlin began just after 10 p.m. and lasted two hours. At that time, the city area was foggy. The British planes dropped flares and quickly found the Helleschestrol station, a quarter of a mile from the city center, and the railway yards between the Postdamer and Anhalter stations, which were closer to the city center. The Hellesche station was bombed by many tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs. Several places in the station caught fire, and the Postdamer station was also heavily bombed. Other targets attacked included the Tier Park station, the main intersection a quarter of a mile northeast of Berlinger Street, and a freight yard between the Ruritz Street military station and the Lairder station. Four hours after the end of the first raid, the second batch of British planes flew to Berlin and dropped bombs, and explosions continued. Klingenburg and Charlottenburg, important power plants, were also attacked. The British planes concentrated their bombing on the Klingenburg power plant for 15 minutes. It is estimated that the fire area occupied a quarter of a square mile. One of the British planes saw flames soaring 150 miles away from Berlin on its way home. The captain of the plane participated in 56 attacks on Germany. He said that the fire he had seen in Germany was never so extensive. The Charlottenburg power plant was hit repeatedly by large bombs dropped by another British plane, and many places caught fire. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The British Aviation Ministry's intelligence department said that on Thursday night, British planes attacked Naples, Italy, for 45 minutes. Oil refineries and oil pools in the southern suburbs of the city were the first to be bombed. There were many explosions, and the ground defenses were weak and ineffective. The British planes attacked a station and a railway intersection at an altitude of 2,000 feet. One anti-aircraft gun position was hit and could not fight back. (3rd Reuters Agency)</p>
<p>Fierce Air Battle over the Seas in Southeastern England; Nine German Planes Shot Down</p>
<p>London: This morning, the Royal Air Force drove German bombers out of the country through brave battles. Over 200 aircraft fought over the southeast coast of England yesterday, and several Italian aircraft participated. The Royal Air Force resisted strongly, and finally launched a counterattack and drove the enemy aircraft out of the airspace. It is said that when the enemy aircraft escaped, they were divided into countless small groups. As a result of the air battle, at least one large Italian bomber with a variable engine was shot down by the British in an unknown village. When the Italian plane hovered at low altitude, the anti-aircraft fire fired intensively. The German aircraft continued to try, but were finally broken into London, but were immediately repelled by the intense anti-aircraft fire. An enemy aircraft broke through the London defense line and dropped many incendiary bombs in the southeast area. A huge fire soared into the sky and could be seen for miles. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to reports received as of late last night, nine German aircraft were shot down by British warplanes yesterday. No British aircraft were lost. The attacking enemy aircraft totaled two large teams, mostly fighters and fighter-bombers. They crossed the Kent coast and sneaked into London. An Aviation Ministry communique stated that the first batch of attacking enemy aircraft were intercepted by British fighters and driven back before reaching London. A few bombs fell in the Kent area, but the loss of life and material damage were minimal. In the second large-scale attack, about 100 enemy aircraft were scattered by British fighters and anti-aircraft defenses. Only a few enemy aircraft sneaked into the sky over London and flew very high. A few bombs fell in the Kent area, and the material damage and casualties were light. A few enemy aircraft also attacked the mouth of the Thames River in the morning and dropped bombs in Kent and Essex, causing slight material damage and slight casualties. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: Responsible sources revealed that German aircraft bombed London and military targets in Hulwich alternately yesterday morning. Two British destroyers were shot down by German fighters.

<p>London: Germany's nightly air raids on London continued as usual shortly after dusk last night. A lone aircraft flew at low altitude, so low that anti-aircraft guns could not bomb it. After breaking into London's air defenses, the aircraft strafed several streets with machine guns. There were scattered German air raids in London last night, and the alert was lifted just after midnight, but London issued an air raid alert again before dawn. The German aircraft's air raids on other central areas of England were also relaxed. (3rd National Community Dispatch)</p>
<p>German Military Report</p>
<p>Berlin: Although it was stormy and rainy last night, which made flying inconvenient, German aircraft still bombed London and the center of British resource supply day and night without interruption. A British airfield was attacked, and German fighters sank a merchant ship of 6,000 tons on the east coast of Britain. The commander of the aircraft was Major Hallinghausen. This was the 20th merchant ship destroyed by Hallinghausen himself, with a total tonnage of over 100,000 tons, which is truly commendable. This morning, enemy aircraft attempted to attack the coast of northern France, but were repelled by German anti-aircraft guns. Two British aircraft were shot down, and two more were shot down by German aircraft in the air battle over London. German aircraft lost seven aircraft in the arduous weather expedition.

<p>Germany's Second Four-Year Plan</p>
<p>Berlin: General Goering of Germany, under the order of Fuehrer Hitler, implemented the second four-year plan and issued a statement yesterday, which briefly stated: "According to the Fuehrer's decision, the four-year plan will continue for four years. We will begin a new era of construction work in the economic and social life. We will carry out this construction work with the confidence that we can be proud of the achievements of the past. I ask the people to cooperate when implementing the four-year plan, and they are all happy to cooperate. The achievements since 1936 have achieved the planned plan. The hard work of the farmers has been able to fully supply bread, and the output of raw materials has also increased. Factories have been added and national defense has been consolidated. I have asked a lot of the people, and the people can understand that the uncompleted work has been completed. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the comrades who worked together. Germany's economic foundation has been solidified and cannot be destroyed. The heroic battles of the frontline soldiers and the loyalty of the people in the rear will help the Fuehrer to complete the victory." (3rd Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Turkey's Foreign Policy Takes Security as a Premise, Preventing Germany's Wild Fantasies about Turkey</p>
<p>Angora: Turkish President Inonu's remarks in Congress were not only satisfactory to those who opposed the Axis powers here, but also agreed by everyone in Congress. This can be seen from the enthusiastic cheers when the Turkish President left the meeting after his speech. The Turkish President's statement on the unbreakable connection of the British-Turkish alliance deserves attention, because this is the first time that Turkey has officially announced the importance of this alliance since the outbreak of the European War, and it is also meaningful when the Axis powers' war zone is gradually approaching the Turkish border. The Turkish President's remarks on the Italian-Greek conflict are also valued by everyone. The Turkish President clearly stated that when the war approaches the security zone that is extremely important to Turkey, Turkey does not want to avoid neutrality. Although the Turkish President did not say clearly what Turkey will do, he did not say that Turkey will not take action at that time. In practice, Turkey cannot actively provide military assistance to Greece in the current environment. However, the Turkish President's warning that Greece is within Turkey's area of interest should make the protectorate aware. It is expected that the Turkish government will soon adopt special plans to increase its military preparations and prevent the Axis powers from expanding their military activities near Turkey. The Turkish President's statement that belligerent countries will not be allowed to use Turkish territory, territorial waters, or airspace when Turkey does not participate in the war can now prevent Germany from having the wild fantasies that Turkey will be like Romania and can be used by it. It can also satisfy the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union suspects that Britain wants to borrow Turkish bases. The Turkish President's statement that friendly relations with the Soviet Union have been restored can also dispel the mutual suspicions between Turkey and the Soviet Union. Observers here believe that judging from the Turkish President's entire speech, this is a realistic statement of Turkey's post-war policy. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Political figures here believe that Turkish President Ismet's speech has clearly stated that if other Balkan countries do not interfere in the Italian-Greek war and Turkey is not attacked, then Turkey does not want to participate in the war. They believe that Southern countries recently announced their neutral attitude, and the Turkish President has re-released this speech. The situation in the Balkans has been clarified, and the Italian-Greek war can be localized. (3rd Huitong Agency)</p>
<p>Hungary: Diplomatic circles here recently recognized that the most important development in the situation in Benstans is that the Soviet Union firmly extended its battle front to the periphery of the Balkans. Because Turkey's public recognition of its friendship with Moscow is equivalent to a "red light" under Moscow's protection to counter the Axis powers' oppression of Southeast Europe. The Soviet Union is now the only European country that can express this firm attitude and restrict the Axis powers' arrogance. Those who believe that Turkish President Inonu could not have used such a tough tone in his speech to Congress on Friday without reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union in advance.</p>

<p>The Current State of the Exchange Clearance Currency - Zhang Jiake</p>
<p>Later Exchange Clearance</p>
<p>Exchange clearance was originally a type of bill standard issued by Shanghai money shops. This type of bill was cashable the day after issue. However, if no cashing was required (i.e., credited to a deposit account), it could be credited to the account on the same day. The difference between exchange clearance and "割頭" (gu tou, a type of negotiable instrument) is that, in principle, exchange clearance is a bill cashable the day after issue, while "割頭" is cashable on the same day, a difference of one day's interest. In reality, within the same transfer zone (foreign and Chinese merchants), both exchange clearance and "割頭" could be credited on the same day, equivalent to being cashable on the same day. Therefore, before the war, when transferring accounts between foreign and Chinese merchants, the difference between the two became apparent in different transfer areas. However, within the same area, both were equivalent to cashable bills, possessing the ability to pay in legal tender, with no significant difference. Consequently, some believe that exchange clearance is the bill standard for Chinese merchants, primarily money shops, while "割頭" is the bill standard for foreign merchants, primarily foreign banks. This explanation aligns well with the facts.</p>
<p>Exchange clearance is a customary bill currency, not legal tender. Therefore, in the past, all transactions, whether exchange clearance or "割頭," were acceptable as long as they could be cashed in legal tender. However, after August 13th, exchange clearance was granted legal tender status by national law. Article 1 of the Supplementary Measures for Stabilizing Finance stipulates: "Promissory notes issued by iron money shops must uniformly bear the exchange clearance mark of the industry association. These notes are only permitted for exchange clearance among Shanghai industry members and cannot be exchanged for legal tender or used to purchase foreign exchange." This effectively granted exchange clearance limited legal tender status within the Shanghai industry transfer area. The nature of exchange clearance after this point clearly differed from the past. Its main characteristic was that exchange clearance had become a locked deposit currency. The sole purpose of this decree was to restrict the outflow of funds.</p>
<p>At this time, Shanghai's currency standard split into two: legal tender and non-legal tender exchange clearance with limited settlement qualifications. In reality, the government did not need to use the exchange clearance system to prevent capital flight, as the locking effect achievable through the exchange clearance system was very limited. Moreover, tens of millions of legal tender were circulating in Shanghai at that time. With no restrictions on purchasing foreign exchange with legal tender, even if holders of exchange clearance did not participate in capital flight, the purchase of foreign exchange with this batch of legal tender would have been sufficient to have an impact. Furthermore, exchange clearance itself was originally legal tender. Even if exchange clearance could not be directly exchanged for legal tender, merchants could use exchange clearance to purchase goods and then sell the goods, transforming it into legal tender in a single transaction. Therefore, in the early stages of implementation, it had some effect in preventing the outflow of funds. However, after a few months, especially after Shanghai became an isolated island, the more deposits one held, the more one wanted to withdraw them; the more exchange clearance one held, the more one wanted to exchange it for legal tender. Thus, due to the disparity in supply and demand, the circulating exchange clearance and legal tender experienced differences in liquidity and exchange value.</p>
<p>Those who needed to exchange exchange clearance for legal tender had no recourse through legitimate channels because the law stipulated that exchange clearance was "not allowed to be exchanged for legal tender." This began with the "black market" of small money shops. Initially, every 1,000 yuan of exchange clearance required a discount of six or seven yuan to be exchanged for legal tender, gradually increasing. At one point, it exceeded 200 yuan outside the customs area, which was the exchange clearance discount. When the exchange clearance discount reached 79 yuan on June 7, 1938, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications entrusted the banking industry to jointly intervene, adjusting supply among industry members as much as possible. The initial discount price was 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan, but it also fluctuated with the market. This action by the banking industry association drew criticism from most public opinion at the time because it violated the government's principle of "not paying in legal tender" and contradicted the principle of locking down funds. Simultaneously, publicly posting the discount rate was tantamount to devaluing exchange clearance. In reality, the exchange clearance discount policy was indeed a failure because the level of the exchange clearance discount rate still followed market fluctuations, and intervention did not achieve any significant effect.</p>
<p>Two. The So-Called New Exchange Clearance</p>
<p>The goal of the exchange clearance lockdown system was to lock down circulating capital and bank deposits. After a considerable period, the amount of legal tender withdrawn increased, and capital flight intensified. During the most severe period of capital flight, the black market for foreign exchange inevitably tightened. At this time, legal tender flowed back into the hands of national banks in large quantities through the purchase of foreign exchange. Therefore, the tightening of foreign exchange and the surge in the exchange clearance discount almost became the same trend. On June 7, 1939, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market experienced a tightening frenzy, and capital flight entered a new stage. To limit the trend of capital flight, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Ma Telegram," stipulating that from June 22nd, Shanghai banks and money shops would pay legal tender deposits made after August 13th as follows: For weekly withdrawals of 500 yuan or less, legal tender would be paid; withdrawals exceeding 500 yuan would be paid in exchange clearance. At this time, public sentiment was already shaken by the sudden tightening of foreign exchange. This restriction caused a run on banks and money shops, and the withdrawn exchange clearance was hastily exchanged for legal tender, with the exchange clearance discount rising to 200 yuan, an unprecedented high price. The "Ma Telegram" temporarily achieved some effectiveness in limiting capital flight, but from the perspective of the overall financial situation, it did not reduce panic. After succeeding in tightening the currency supply, it became necessary to adopt the opposite policy to relieve the panic in the banking and money shop industry, which was what everyone called the new exchange clearance.</p>
<p>The new exchange clearance adopted two steps: (1) The 22 million yuan of exchange clearance deposits held by banks and money shops in the banking industry reserve were converted into legal tender in consultation with the Joint Reserve Board of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank, based on the balance of each bank and money shop on June 30th, at a uniform rate of 19.5% (i.e., calculated at an exchange clearance discount rate of 50 yuan), over twelve weeks from July 4th to September 25th. (2) Each bank and money shop could use property as collateral to obtain exchange clearance, with a total amount of 50 million yuan. These steps immediately provided banks and money shops with the convenience of exchanging for legal tender, while also alleviating the panic of a lack of capital. However, because exchange clearance could be exchanged for cash through discounting, this policy was effectively equivalent to abolishing the past "lockdown" and "tightening" policies. From a theoretical perspective, neither was the best approach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the long-term discount gap between exchange clearance and legal tender should bear some responsibility for this new exchange clearance system. Why? Originally, exchange clearance on the market, after a long period of discount, could be turned into legal tender at a discount. At that time, the relationship between legal tender and exchange clearance, expressed in an equation, was: "Exchange clearance plus exchange clearance discount equals legal tender." Therefore, using exchange clearance to pay for things where legal tender was required was the same as paying with legal tender. However, after the issuance of the new exchange clearance, the market had an additional 50 million yuan of exchange clearance positions, naturally increasing the supply. As a result, the exchange clearance discount rate remained at around 100 yuan for almost the entire period. In April of this year, a new high price of 240-250 yuan was witnessed.</p>
<p>The main strength of the exchange clearance system lay in the lockdown, but under the principle that exchange clearance could be exchanged for legal tender (i.e., with the exchange clearance discount), the effectiveness of the lockdown had long been lost. As for deposits in banks, due to the passage of time, the Measures for Stabilizing Finance and the limitations of the "Ma Telegram" were no longer in effect. At this time, the effectiveness of exchange clearance in the main market was limited to government bonds still being priced in exchange clearance, with only a small number of transactions still using exchange clearance. The rest were counted in legal tender.</p>
<p>Three. The Current State of Exchange Clearance Currency</p>
<p>In recent months, the market price of the exchange clearance discount has been declining daily. By the end of last week, the exchange clearance discount had fallen to only slightly over three yuan per 1,000 yuan. In the government bond market, because the difference between exchange clearance and "劃頭" (hua tou, another type of negotiable instrument) was negligible, "劃頭" pricing was adopted instead. Since the existence of the exchange clearance discount, this can be... What is this?</p>
<p>Here, we need to understand the principle of the level of the exchange clearance discount. Exchange clearance and legal tender are two parallel currencies. The level of the discount rate explains the supply and demand relationship between the two. The decline in the exchange clearance discount does not indicate that the value of exchange clearance has risen, but rather that the quantity of legal tender exceeds demand.</p>
<p>During the period of declining exchange clearance discounts, we need to point out another phenomenon: the Shanghai interbank lending rate also trended downward. Why would the interbank lending rate trend downward? This indicates an excess of funds in the market, and the biggest reason for creating an excess of funds is the loosening of foreign exchange, especially the equilibrium of near- and far-term prices.</p>
<p>Large-scale capital flight causes a tightening of foreign exchange, and the tighter the foreign exchange, the more severe the capital flight. During this period, because those who purchased foreign exchange needed legal tender, and legal tender flowed into banks after purchasing foreign exchange, the supply of legal tender gradually contracted. Due to the tightening of legal tender and foreign exchange, anxious people worried that legal tender would turn into worthless currency, so they eagerly purchased foreign exchange to hoard it. Many importers, anticipating a large amount of legal tender income in the coming months, sold off their legal tender in advance to purchase foreign exchange for the following month to prevent the depreciation of legal tender. As a result, not only did the spot market for foreign exchange contract, but the forward market for foreign exchange also contracted. In the end, due to the difficulty of obtaining legal tender positions, those who purchased forward foreign exchange even exceeded those who purchased spot foreign exchange. In this way, the difference between near- and far-term exchange rates widened, meaning that forward exchange rates were tighter than spot exchange rates. The so-called "arbitrage" transactions arose in this way. At its peak, one could arbitrage four jiao per month, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 40%. With such high returns from arbitrage, the price of legal tender naturally increased. In terms of exchange clearance, this was a surge in the discount; in terms of interest rates, this was a surge in the interbank lending rate. However, under certain changing circumstances, the outlook for foreign exchange was bullish, and those who held foreign exchange sold it to exchange for legal tender. The supply of legal tender increased, and the supply of foreign exchange also increased, so near- and far-term rates converged. Due to the return of funds, legal tender flowed out of the banks again, ...</p>
<p>In normal times, there is a certain difference between legal tender and exchange clearance. This difference stems from "exchange clearance being cashable the day after issue," which is one day's interest, so it is only a few jiao per thousand. Now, if this trend continues and foreign exchange loosens further, then the exchange clearance discount will naturally decline further, even to the point of disappearing. However, since the decline in the exchange clearance discount is based on the aforementioned reasons, the discount rate may still rise when the aforementioned situation reappears.</p>
<p>Under this current state of exchange clearance currency, what we should be discussing is no longer the issue of the exchange clearance discount, nor the issue of how to lock down legal tender, but rather the entire issue of Shanghai financial management.</p>
<p>First, the exchange clearance lockdown system has now proven to be merely a possible method of locking down funds. Beyond a certain scope and after a certain time, its possibility is lost. Therefore, the only way to lock down funds is to strictly manage exchange controls; there is no other way.</p>
<p>Second, the exchange clearance discount policy adopted by Shanghai financial managers was fundamentally wrong in principle and unsuccessful in method. Because the decline in the exchange clearance discount only indicates that exchange clearance and legal tender can equalize, not that exchange clearance has been completely locked down.</p>
<p>Third, today, the inability of exchange clearance to purchase foreign exchange has disappeared due to the abuse of the foreign exchange market, so it has gradually reverted to its pre-war status as an exchange clearance currency. The main function of exchange clearance was originally lockdown. Now that lockdown is no longer possible, the standard of exchange clearance has reached the point where it can be abolished for the sake of unifying the standard. It is hoped that the financial authorities will abolish the post-war definition of "exchange clearance" and that the banking industry authorities will abolish the standard of exchange clearance with an enlightened attitude so that the capital supply in this city can be unified and the target of irregular financial speculation can be reduced.</p>
<p>Fourth, finally, I feel that to ensure the safety of the Shanghai financial market in the future, everyone should discuss how to secure the circulating capital in the future, how to eliminate foreign exchange speculation inside and outside the industry, and how to adjust the capital in Shanghai to reach a solution.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Gold Black Market - Yuan Hui</h3>
<p>I. The Decline of Gold Bar Speculation</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally a metropolis where speculation thrived. Before the "August 13th" Incident, the gold exchange, which specialized in trading gold bars, was the center of speculation. China does not produce much gold, and China's monetary system does not use the gold standard. Merchants engaged in international trade could entrust banks to buy and sell foreign exchange for the purpose of foreign exchange receipts and payments, and there was very little need to buy, sell, and transport gold as a means of international receipts and payments. Therefore, speculative transactions accounted for the vast majority of Shanghai's gold market. Moreover, due to the lack of capital for gold bars in Shanghai, speculative transactions of short selling and long buying were difficult to settle with physical delivery at the time of delivery, and foreign exchange was often forced to settle the price. However, the foreign exchange used for settlement also changed from time to time, which can be divided into the following five periods:</p>
<p>1.  Before World War I, settlement was in British pounds.</p>
<p>2.  From the World War until 1926, settlement was changed to Japanese yen.</p>
<p>3.  After 1926, settlement was changed back to British pounds.</p>
<p>4.  In September 1931, settlement was changed to US dollars.</p>
<p>5.  From September 9, 1934, settlement was changed to the exchange rate listed by the Central Bank for customs gold.</p>
<p>By the winter of 1935, the National Government implemented the legal tender policy, foreign exchange was stable, and the exchange rate of legal tender was often at the level of one shilling and two pence and 30 US dollars, so speculators lost the basis for creating waves. The price of gold bars fluctuated very little, and the gold exchange's business became sluggish, so gold bar speculation was on the road to decline.</p>
<p>II. The Rise of the Black Market</p>
<p>After the "August 13th" Incident, all exchanges in Shanghai were ordered to suspend business. As the war shifted westward, the status of the Shanghai concessions gradually became special. Refugees from the Jiangzhe area gathered in the isolated island, and funds from the interior also concentrated in one corner of Shanghai. In the spring of 1938, silver and gold shops specializing in decorative gold felt the need for a trading market to facilitate the circulation of cash, so Jin Tongsheng and others, employees of a certain bank, came forward to contact gold and silver industry members to organize the Dayuan Silver Shop on Sichuan Road to buy and sell "烚赤" (sha chi, refined gold) in order to circulate finance among industry members. Moreover, because the government implemented foreign exchange controls, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market arose, and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market gradually increased, so the black market for "烚赤" also fluctuated sharply. In addition, because a large amount of floating capital gathered in the city and speculation was prevalent, "烚赤" became one of the speculative transactions. Later, securities firms and money exchangers joined, gradually becoming Shanghai's most prosperous speculative market.</p>
<p>Trading Object: The transaction in the market is limited to spot "烚赤", and the required purity is 997/1000, which is higher than the purity of the gold bars traded before the war, which was 978/1000.</p>
<p>Transaction Unit: Ten market taels are called one bar.</p>
<p>Opening Time: Every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, twice a day, from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. There is no market on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Trading Procedures: Industry members entering the market for trading must be approved by industry members. They do not need to pay margin, nor do they charge each other commission. However, the "烚赤" that is traded should be delivered before the opening of the market the next day. If it is not delivered, the difference should be calculated according to the closing price of the day and paid separately.</p>
<p>Industry Members Entering the Market: According to a survey in September 1940, the following 36 companies have joined the market successively: Tianyuan, Zhenkang, Tongkang, Defu, Chengda, Yuzhong (the above are called silver shops). Yang Mohe, Lao Moyun, Jing, Xintian Shi, Fei Wenyuan, Bei Qingyun, Baocheng, Lao Fengxiang, Fu Fengxiang, Fengxiang Heji, Lao Tianbao (the above are called silver buildings). Tong Fengyong, Shengyuan Yong, Dadecheng, Taikangrun, Yongfeng, Yongfengyu, Tiancheng, Wanxing, Yida, Xiangyu, Sheng Dayong, Rencheng, Yu Fenghang, Xinyuan, Yutai, Xincheng (the above are called gold shops). Tiaotai, Baokang (the above are called money shops).</p>
<p>The above 36 companies are all in the Tianyuan Silver Shop market and can be directly traded. They all have direct telephone lines to report the market at any time. Their position is about the same as that of brokers in the exchange. There are also no less than two or three hundred small money shops and silver shops that operate "烚赤" transactions, all of which are entrusted to the above 36 companies for agency. Each bar entering and exiting pays a commission of one or two yuan. If non-industry members want to operate this speculative transaction, they can entrust these small money shops and silver shops to handle it, and they must pay a margin of 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan for each bar of "烚赤". They must also pay a commission of one yuan to six yuan. If you are bullish, you must also pay interest of 1% to 3%. (According to the market rules, all transactions are spot "烚赤", and the margin paid by customers is only used to prepare for the payment of the difference. If you are bullish, you must buy spot goods, so the price of each bar of "烚赤" must be paid by the money shop and silver shop that handles the transaction, so customers must also pay interest. The income of industry members operating this type of transaction is mainly from commissions and interest.)</p>
<p>III. Market Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>The black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai has been very volatile for the past three years since it occurred in March 1938, so the black market for "烚赤" has also risen and fallen greatly. In 1938, the exchange rate of the US dollar fell from 30 yuan to 21 yuan, and the exchange rate of the British pound fell from one shilling and two pence to eight and a half pence. The black market for "烚赤" rose from more than 1,000 yuan to more than 2,000 yuan, and the statistical high and low range for the whole year reached 669 yuan. Last year, in June 1939, the US dollar suddenly shrank to 11 yuan, the British pound shrank to six and a half pence, and "烚赤" rose to more than 3,000 yuan. In July and August, foreign exchange was blocked, and the US dollar shrank again to 4.6875 yuan and 3.25 pence for the British pound, and "烚赤" rose to 4,800 yuan. In September, due to the outbreak of the European war, foreign exchange was loosened. At the end of November, the Ministry of Finance implemented the policy of nationalizing gold, and the price of gold first fell twice, but then continued to rise to more than 4,000 yuan. The statistical high and low difference for the whole year reached 2,832 yuan. This spring, the foreign exchange hovered around 6 yuan for the US dollar and 4 pence for the British pound, and the price of gold was often around 5,000 yuan. It once fell to 1,020 yuan. On May 3, the foreign exchange suddenly contracted again, the US dollar shrank to 4.3125 yuan, the British pound shrank to 3 pence, and the price of "烚赤" rose to the highest peak of 7,250 yuan. Later, due to the expansion of the European war, German troops invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, and funds from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia flowed back to Shanghai, and foreign exchange was loosened, and the price of gold gradually fell. In August, the Ministry of Finance announced the commercial exchange rate, which was reduced from 7.5 pence for the British pound to 4.5 pence. Speculators believed that the government had lowered the price of legal tender, so the foreign exchange black market tightened from about 4 pence to 3.7 pence, and the US dollar tightened from about 6 yuan to 5 yuan. The price of gold once rose to 6,480 yuan. In October, the situation in the Pacific was dangerous, and foreign exchange gradually loosened again, and the price of gold fell to 5,385 yuan. The statistical high and low difference reached 3,230 yuan, which shows the drastic rise and fall in the price of gold.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the market price of "烚赤" roughly follows the black market for foreign exchange, as mentioned above. However, Shanghai does not have much cash, and the export of gold is not free, so the standard price of "烚赤" calculated according to the official US gold price and the US dollar exchange rate (not including transportation costs) is as follows:</p>
<p>X US dollars</p>
<p>20 market taels (purity 0.997)</p>
<p>10 market taels 482.26 grains</p>
<p>480 grains 35 US dollars (official price)</p>
<p>According to this formula, it can be known that one bar in Shanghai should be 35.592972 US dollars. Divide by the US dollar exchange rate to get the fair value price of Shanghai's listing of US gold.</p>
<p>IV. Changing from Spot to Futures</p>
<p>In early October of this year, the situation in the Pacific became increasingly tense, and the US dollar was loosened. Speculators in "烚赤" tried their best to sell short, which caused the market price to fall miserably from 6,480 yuan to 5,475 yuan. Speculators sold short for more than a few bars, and cash was very scarce. Most of the long positions had a background. With their strong strength, they wanted to receive spot goods and were unwilling to release dividends, which led to the squeeze on October 19. Foreign exchange and gold prices went in opposite directions. The US dollar recovered from 5.8115 yuan to 5.84375 yuan, and the gold bar rose from 5,680 yuan to 5,830 yuan, and the highest was nearly 5,900 yuan. After the close, the long positions advocated that all unfinished transactions should be settled at the closing price of the US dollar on the day, which was 5.84375 yuan, which was equivalent to 5,990 yuan. The short positions insisted on not agreeing. Later, a method was used to settle the price at the closing price of the day, which was 5,830 yuan. Since this squeeze, there has been no news of stranded ships among industry members, but it is difficult to trade spot goods. Therefore, the market was closed for three days. The manager of Tianyuan Silver Shop convened a meeting of industry members to reorganize the methods. The "烚赤" market was handled in accordance with the trading methods, and the name was changed to Lianyigonghui. The number of registered members of the association was fixed at 40, and each member had to pay a security deposit of 2,000 yuan, for a total of 800,000 yuan, which was kept by five members of the management committee appointed by the chairman, Pan Sansheng. Zhang Tongsheng, the manager of Dayuan Silver Shop, also served as the manager of Lianyigonghui, responsible for presiding over the affairs. As for the trading object, it was changed to futures "烚赤". The margin for each bar was 400 yuan, and delivery was made twice a month. If delivery was not made when due, the position had to be rolled over, or the price was settled according to the HSBC Bank's listing price of import bills at 9:30 on the day. As for the brokers in the association, the original industry members were added as much as possible, otherwise, they would be supplemented by recruitment.</p>
<p>The Lianyigonghui's futures trading opened on the 24th of this month. There are currently 28 listed brands, namely: 1. Tianyuan, 2. Defu, 3. Xinyuan, 4. Xianghe, 5. Tongkangyong, 6. Hengji, 7. Chengji, 8. Decheng, 9. Shunyuan, 10. Xinfeng, 11. Deda, 12. Chenggda, 13. Dafeng, 14. Yuyuyong, 15. Yida, 16. Wanfeng, 17. Yuni Run, 18. Hesheng, 19. Yutaifeng, 20. Dingsheng, 21. Renchengyong, 22. Mingfeng, 23. Xiangyuyong, 24. Litai, 25. Hongqingyong, 26. Shihe, 27. Huanda, 28. Gongda. Because the original 12 silver shop gangs have not joined, the number of fixed brokers is 40. From the inside, the change in the market! However, it is the trading method, which has been changed from spot to futures "烚赤", but in fact, the significance of this reorganization is not so simple, because if we observe carefully, the speculative transactions of the Lianyigonghui in the future will inevitably hinder the national economy and be even worse than before.</p>
<p>First, although the Tianyuan market trading was mostly speculative, there was still 1-2% of spot trading, and the "烚赤" was delivered. In the context of the concessions still allowing silver shops to publicly buy and sell decorative gold, it was still a function of turning around the money. However, after being reorganized into a futures market and the silver shop gang withdrew, the price can be settled in foreign exchange at the time of delivery, so the Lianyigonghui market trading will inevitably be purely speculative trading, and there will be no cash delivery. Because there is no restriction on cash, the rise and fall of the market price in the future will be even more drastic than before.</p>
<p>First, today's concessions are maintained under international protection, and this black market that violates national laws has occurred. The Japanese are trying to use this black market as a means to undermine the legal tender system and absorb funds. After this reorganization, the Japanese magic hand has openly stretched into the "烚赤" black market, which is undeniable. It is not difficult to know who will control this black market in the future and what a major impact it will have on China's national economy.</p>
<h3>Commercial News and Financial Review - Sheng Kaiqiong</h3>
<p>November 2nd</p>
<p>Reasons for the Rise in Government Bonds (Continued)</p>
<p>To study the reasons for the rise in government bonds during this period, we must first understand the changes in the economic environment during this period. Since the signing of the military and economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the development of the international situation has been very beneficial to China's future. As a result, China's national economic environment has also changed. Significant facts: First, on September 26, the US government officially announced that the US would lend 25 million yuan to China to maintain China's foreign exchange needs, and stated that the US had decided to purchase 30 million yuan worth of gunpowder from the China Resources Committee. Then, Britain realized that it was "helping the evildoers" and abandoned its policy of appeasement in the Far East, and responded to the US loans to China by opening the Burma Road on October 18, so that the necessary resources and economic construction materials could be imported into China, and China's resources could be exported abroad. Later, on October 18, it was reported that the US would lend a huge amount of money to China again, and the discussion was being held by Jones, the administrator of the Federal Loan Administration, and Song Ziwen, the chairman of the Bank of China. Because China's economy has received so much help, its strength has been strengthened, which has made the owners of funds rolling in and out of the speculative market realize that legal tender is still the most solid property. At the same time, foreign exchange in the speculative market is loosening, and foreign stocks are falling, so speculation is not only unprofitable, but also suffers losses. Then, why speculate and harm, rather than invest and benefit! As a result, they turned to government bonds with more than 1% investment benefits. What's more, China has already grasped the winning ticket. If you buy when the bond market is still at a low price, the investment benefits will be even greater. Therefore, in just two months, the market price of high-priced A and B types has risen by more than 1/10, and the price of low-priced C, D, and E types has reached 13%.</p>
<p>The Future of Exchange Clearance Discount</p>
<p>The exchange clearance bill discount market is not directly related to the black market for foreign exchange, but because those who hold exchange clearance funds want to exchange it for foreign exchange when the exchange market is shrinking, the change in the market is based on the change in foreign exchange. For detailed statistics on this change, please refer to The Central Bank Of China Bulletin, 1939 P.257. According to the examples of this year, the discount was as high as 250 yuan during the "May 2" exchange market upheaval. After the exchange market loosened, the discount also fell by 60 yuan. Recently, the group in October hovered within 20 yuan, and since the 26th, it has entered the 10 yuan level, and on November 1, it saw the lowest market of 4 yuan, returning to the situation at the end of 1937. The following is a statistic for the six months from May to October 1938: (The monthly week is the unit, and the lowest in October is 5.5 yuan)</p>
<p>The exchange clearance discount market is based on foreign exchange, but because government bonds are bought and sold with exchange clearance bills, the change in the market price is more subject to the supply and demand rate due to the supply and demand of exchange clearance bills when buying and selling government bonds. In other words, when the foreign exchange market is stable and there is no change or loosening, the discount market will tend to be low due to the large demand for exchange clearance capital. On the contrary, if the demand is small or even not needed, the discount market will tend to be high or stable. Recently, due to the absorption of government bonds by all parties, the demand for exchange clearance capital is large, so the average price has fallen from more than 45 yuan to 27 yuan and then to 13 yuan.</p>
<p>After a large amount of exchange clearance capital was transformed into government bonds, the supply of exchange clearance capital for the purchase and sale of government bonds was insufficient, so it was changed to "劃頭" trading on November 1. Many people think that the trend of exchange clearance discount will disappear. Under the government's legal restrictions, it is of course hoped that it can be as good as the introduction, but in fact, I am afraid it is still difficult to do. The current lack of exchange clearance capital is because it has been converted into government bonds and has not disappeared. The final result is to retreat into the hands of the National Bank. The principal and interest of government bonds are still paid with exchange clearance. A part of the remittances from various ports to Shanghai are also paid with exchange clearance. The exchange clearance capital hidden in the National Bank will slowly flow into the market. Therefore, the current trend of exchange clearance discount is probably still hovering at the current level. It is difficult to be high, and it is not low. The future changes will still depend on the future financial situation.</p>
<p>Reduced Production of Jellyfish</p>
<p>The production of jellyfish this year is not abundant, about 30-40%, so the source is very rare. The existing inventory in the market has been sold successively, and it is deeply felt that there is a shortage. The jellyfish skin is even less, so the price has gradually risen. The sale price has risen from 60 yuan to 110 yuan. The jellyfish head with tape is also required for 75 yuan.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Sales of Thin Plain Serge</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the wool was not delivered, the spot transaction was still strong. Winter sales of overcoats, camel hair, medium-thick fancy wool, and thick plain wool were all sold in retail and wholesale. The sales of thin plain serge, whether they were hidden gray camel colors, have decreased greatly. Wholesale is mostly stopped due to the inaccessibility of customer roads. The retail business of the door shops in this street has decreased greatly compared with previous years. Plain serge was originally sold by the crew of the ships. Now the number of ships operating has been greatly reduced. Because they can't make a profit, the gangs in the copper, iron, woodworking, and water yards also often make thin plain serge into clothes and trousers. At the moment, the cost of living is high, and the price of serge is expensive, so they are mostly unable to buy it. Ordinary people, because the price is the same at more than three yuan a foot, now mostly change to cut other fancy goods, so the factory has recently reduced the production of plain serge. Yesterday, Zhanghua thin plain serge was wholesaled for 11.5 yuan per yard, and the Daguangming Honey Rich brand was sold for 12.75 yuan. Grass green and grass yellow were priced at 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The opening auction of Yihwa Brewery shares</p>
<p>Volume of transactions over 380,000 shares in the first week</p>
<p>Down from eight yuan to seven yuan four jiao</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of those who grabbed the new shares of the British Yihwa Brewery Company exceeded eight times the number of shares offered has been detailed in this newspaper. It is heard that most of those who subscribed this time were "scalpers" who made a small profit and sold the shares. Since October 28, the auction has been officially approved by the public association, and the opening price was eight yuan. On November 1, it had fallen to seven yuan one jiao five fen, and the closing price was seven yuan four jiao. The volume of transactions on the first day after the opening reached 176,000 shares, and the total volume of transactions within a week was 382,800 shares.</p>
<p>No Movement in White Lead Skin</p>
<p>The white lead skin market, which has been quiet for a long time, has still not seen any movement recently. Because the appetite of battery factories has weakened (because several larger factories have moved to the interior to operate), and the customers of Qingyi, Qinhuangdao, and other gangs have no sales, the market is quiet, and the market price is hovering. At the moment, No. 2 is sold for 1,200 yuan per barrel, No. 3 and No. 4 are sold for 1,150 yuan, No. 5 and No. 6 are sold for 1,050 yuan, No. 7 and No. 8 are sold for 1,100 yuan, No. 9 is sold for 1,150 yuan,</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Southern Guangxi Continues to Advance, Pressing Close to the Outskirts of Zhennanguan; Fierce Fighting with Japanese Troops; Japan Plans to Retreat into Vietnam; Chinese Troops in the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Area Continue to Capture Xiaodong and Dadong</h3>
<p>Longzhou: After capturing Pingxiang on the 31st, the Chinese army continued to advance south, pressing close to the outskirts of Zhennanguan on the 1st and engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanning: The Chinese army, launching fierce attacks on the south bank of the Yong River, continued to capture Xiaodong on the morning of the 31st and recaptured Dagangxu on the morning of the 2nd. The Japanese troops retreated in panic. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: An official announcement was released here today stating that the Chinese army had recaptured Pingxiang, 40 miles south of Longzhou, on October 31st. Pingxiang was the only town in Guangxi where the Japanese troops repeatedly repelled Chinese counter-offensives. The announcement stated that the Japanese troops had retreated towards Zhennanguan. Previous reports indicated that the Japanese troops in Zhennanguan had made various preparations to retreat into French-Indochina (Vietnam). It is also reported that the Chinese army operating on the Qinzhou-Xiaodong highway is closely pursuing the Japanese troops retreating from Qinzhou. (3rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Nanning Comforting Delegation of the Pacification Headquarters' Political Department, and the personnel dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters to Nanning and other counties to inspect Party affairs, departed for the Nanning area on the evening of the 3rd. Also, a seven-member Nanning visiting delegation from the Guilin press corps is scheduled to depart on the evening of the 4th. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to reports in the local newspapers, rumors that the Japanese troops in Nanning were withdrawing to Hainan Island are untrue. The destination of the Japanese retreat is Taiwan. Furthermore, according to Li Jishen, deputy chairman of the Battlefield Party Affairs Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, the Japanese troops withdrew from Nanning for the following reasons: (1) To prepare for defense against Britain and the United States; (2) The people of southern Guangxi are strong and brave, and there is a shortage of grain in the area, causing the Japanese troops to suffer more losses than gains; (3) To concentrate forces in an attempt to achieve success on other battlefields. However, after the Japanese troops withdraw from Nanning, they are unlikely to advance south for the time being, because Britain and the United States are already prepared, and reckless provocation will inevitably lead to a disastrous defeat. It is also impossible to move troops to attack Yunnan. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Quietly Spends His Birthday</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chairman Chiang quietly spent his 54th birthday last Thursday in the wartime capital. Zhongzheng University in Taihe County, Jiangxi, was originally named in commemoration of Chairman Chiang. On that day, all its faculty, staff and students gathered to respectfully listen to the speech delivered by Chairman Chiang. Afterwards, all the teachers and students of the school sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to congratulate him. This year's birthday was not celebrated, and all sectors of the country paid little attention. It is recorded that in 1936, on Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday, the country donated five fighter planes to celebrate. (3rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation: 27th to 2nd</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (October 27th to November 2nd), the war results on all fronts have been excellent. The recapturing of Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang and Nanning in Guangxi Province dealt a great blow to the Japanese. A summary of the battle progress is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangxi and Guangdong</p>
<p>Since last week, the Chinese army in southern Guangxi has launched fierce attacks on the outskirts of Nanning, successively capturing important strongholds along the Yongbin Road. On the Yongwu Road, it captured Gaofeng'ao, Xinwei, Datang and Jiandao, advancing to the suburbs of Nanning.

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Reviews the Sino-Japanese War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to Moscow news, the Red Army's organ newspaper (Red Star Newspaper) recently published an article making a detailed review of the Sino-Japanese War, and included a newly drawn map for explanation. The newspaper stated that the Chinese army's victory in attacking the vicinity of Nanchang City and the active attack in Anhui gave the Japanese army a major blow. Fierce battles also broke out around Taihu Lake. The Japanese army's attempt to expand the battlefield in that area has failed. The article further stated the war situation around Nanning, saying that the Chinese command dispatched a large number of reinforcements and gave the Japanese side some blows. The Japanese side's hope to shorten the battle line can also be used as another explanation for withdrawing from Nanning. The article also mentioned the active situation of Chinese guerrillas on Hainan Island, an important Japanese strategic area in the south. In general, the retreat of the Japanese army from Nanning and the recent military operations in various places are all beneficial to China. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Female Hero on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The 50,000 Chinese garrison troops are now in contact with the guerrillas, scattered in the interior of Hainan Island. One of the guerrilla teams is commanded by Ms. Liu Qiuzhu, who is armed with two guns in each hand. Ms. Liu is 35 years old, a member of the Communist Party, and has a beautiful appearance and vigor. She is indeed a heroine. Several of Ms. Liu's relatives died in Japanese air raids, so she vowed to capture the Japanese and be satisfied. However, on the other hand, the Japanese army has offered a high reward for Ms. Liu's head, because her night attacks on the Japanese army's outposts have caused great damage to the Japanese naval and ground forces. (2nd International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Chongqing Incident Completed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The American representative of the China National Aviation Corporation has completed the investigation of the Chongqing passenger plane incident, and has telegraphed a report to the US State Department yesterday.
