<p>社論</p>
<h3>傳聞中之日泰談判</h3>
<p>茲在評論本題之前，請先略述一二：遠東獨立國家僅有三國，中國與日本及暹羅是也，暹羅近始改稱泰國。日本對中國侵略的本質，要在鯨吞而歸於毀滅；用兵三年，一無成就，於是不得已而求其次，遂想一面保留中國的名稱，而在實際上攘奪了中國主權，使中國作彼附庸，不復爲獨立國家。中國則正在繼續抗戰圖存之中。可是日本的宏願，他要成爲遠東獨一無二的獨立國家，亦即不容遠東尙存第二獨立國，於是在對華侵略的同時，又向泰國進行壓迫了。</p>
<p>日來紛傳日本向泰國提出酷烈的要求，其內容包括四點：第一，日海陸軍在泰設置根據地；第二，日陸軍得利用泰國鐵路；第三，日泰訂立互助協定；第四，兩國海陸軍密切合作。如果所傳不虛，則日本南進觸鬚已急劇由南中國海伸向東印度洋。前此日本對海南諸島以及邕欽一路的攻略，對法越英緬的苛刻要求，尙可藉口於侵華作戰需要，以掩飾其南侵的眞實慾求；至於泰國，則領土旣不與中國相接，其對於敵對着的中日之間，在在可見其更左祖着日本；此而猶復加以壓力，提出夷爲附庸的條件，這除却準備從事南太平洋和印度洋的大戰，把西方國家驅出遠東而外，更無法用其他託詞爲解釋。</p>
<p>新加坡號稱東方直布羅陀，是大英帝國在遠東最堅强的根據地；當一九三八年二月舉行軍港開慕禮的時候，英總督湯瑪斯曾說：「新加坡是和平的最大保障，是排除戰爭的保證物」那並非誇大，因爲這一要塞實力的堅强，確足使任何侵略者望而却步。但是新加坡也有其先天的弱點。其主要的致命傷便是來自暹羅方面的威脅。因爲新加坡對岸的馬來半島背後，只是以狹長土股與南亞相接聯，並沒有天然的屛障。是以泰國的動向實足左右新加坡要塞的軍事價値，幾年來暄騰人口的開鑿克拉運河計畫如果實現，那不只會轉移遠東的貿易航綫，並將促使馬來半島攻防形勢的改觀，甚至使英國艱辛締造的新加坡要塞失其功能。雖然英國曾在克拉附近地帶設防，但假如泰方投入英國敵人的懷　、則緬甸印度以及英國的遠東全部屬領所遭際的危機，將非目前其在遠東的軍事配備所能應付。日本如無意與英衝突則已，如其決意摧毀遠東的英國，則必不免以全力壓迫暹羅入彀以收事半功倍之效。無論前述傳說的眞實性何若，日閥在對法越橫施壓力之餘，必不會放過比越南更具重要性的泰國。</p>
<p>這種危機·泰國朝野並非毫無覺察，他們曾對日本曲意結歡，但也力求避免刺激英法；開鑿克拉運河的呼聲時作時輟而迄未實行，也正由於此種原因。但泰國之比較傾向軸心國和日本，實爲無容諱飾的事實。爲了曲徇日方要求，以往曾一再壓抑華僑的愛國運動，封閉華文報紙及學校，雖經蔣委員長電達該邦當局勸吿，也祗使他稍稍修改了些外貌，而並未放棄其虐政。現在日本並不感念泰國多年來的曲意承歡，及泰國遠超過公正程度的友誼，却爲了拓展的需要，竟不惜視泰國主權爲無物。若講一句意氣的話，這是日本的本來面目，無足深責；但在泰國則徒自卑屈，可謂咎由自取，原來亞洲僅存的幾個獨立國中，泰國政治縱不十分修明，其力爭上游亦殊可貴；而近年以來其執政者不識大體，不想圖存於是非和正義之下，却對於侵略者的暴行則曲予優容，對力謀解放的鄰邦則視同陌路，甚且不自量力，强拾近代侵略國家的牙慧，幻想藉泰族血統淵源，以實現其囊括南亞大陸的迷夢，而不肯與東方民族解放運動主流相匯合，以保障弱小者的共同權益，其愚昧固可嗤、其未來命運則殊堪憐憫。</p>
<p>像前述的一些條件，殆非任何略具正義感與自尊心的國家所能接受。越南不過是法國若干殖民地單位之一，今當宗國戰敗之餘，且不願見當地主權之橫遭割裂；則泰國縱號親日，際此主奴榮辱關頭，應不致比法越對日本更柔順。且泰國領土逼近印緬和馬來，處英德勢力三面包圍之中，如果爲了結歡遙遠友邦而觸忤近旁强鄰，殆亦不免別有其後果。是以英國即使在歐洲慘遭敗衂，祗要並非帝國的根本崩潰，則恐日本未必竟能輕易在泰境饜其大慾。其是否將不顧一切而操切從事，則全要看此後遠東國際局面與中日戰爭形勢之如何發展。雖然泰國與其昆鄰的英法屬領，於此均當有所覺悟，彼此務須採取一致步驟以求自保，幸勿循着揚湯止沸的覆轍去製造亂源。在泰國當局，尤須重新考慮其一貫立塲和外交政策，並特別要認淸中國抗戰對於東力弱小民族的價値及　義。</p>

<p>陳炎林、現年三十三歲、南京人、開設業成實業社於山西路（即漢口路畫錦里口）景福里九號、出售大喜牙膏、營業尙稱不惡、眷屬卽寓於樓上、昨晨上午十一時十五分許、陳身穿白紡綢衫袴、坐於西廂房經理室內、正在處理事務時、突有十餘齡之童孩一名、叩門進內、掉換大喜牙膏贈券、詎後面尾隨綁匪六人、一人在大門外把風、餘均畫擁人內、闖入西廂房、其中三人、均出示盒子砲、向陳威脅、禁止聲張、一面取出手銬、將陳變手銬住、强拽外出、竟圖挾登預停於里口之汽車、綁架而去、</p>
<p>槍傷事主</p>
<p>斯時陳不爲屈服、力向匪等抵抗、無如寡不敵衆、卒被拖出里口、適有一華捕途經該處、瞥見服西裝者多名、强拽一人、知非善類、遂拔出公事手槍、朝天開放一響、匪等見街捕到來、事已敗露一乃向陳開放盒子砲一響、中其右背、穿入前腋、彈留右臂、肺部略受微傷、陳中彈後、應聲踣地、鮮血汨汨而出、此時附近華捕聞警雲集、又有一西捕亦巡邏經過、中央捕房亦聞訊、驅警備車到來、加以圍捕、</p>
<p>一場格鬥</p>

<h3>遠東和歐局，在何種情形下將起聯繫作用？在何種情形下將起個別作用？以目前情勢推測將來，聯繫可能大還是個別可能大？（續）</h3>
<p>隱山　遠東和歐洲的戰爭局面之是否能併合爲一條混合路綫，我們認爲這個關鍵，將決定於日美兩國之捲入歐亞戰爭的漩渦與否以爲斷。如果日本放棄其口口聲聲的「不介入」政策，而悍然實行南進，或是美國一旦果敢參戰，進行太平洋或大西洋的交戰，那麼這歐亞的二股戰陣，無疑地將迅卽聯繫而糾結成爲一個更龐大的局面。</p>
<p>不過依據目前的情勢來看。我們始終認爲這種聯繫的可能性很少。關於這，無論由美國方面朝野一致的「不參戰」的呼聲，或是從日本方面的那個重作馮婦的近衛內閣的一再聲明之諸種事實來觀察，都已多分顯示了前途的趨向。</p>
<p>裴星惠　國際的錯綜複雜，可說都是有聯繫作用的。假如一定要加以劃分，也祗能從時間與空間上，以及影響所及的大小上劃分。</p>
<p>遠東和歐局，在何種情形下會起聯繫作用，也就是說在何種情形下，這兩個戰局會合成一個戰局的問題。目前日本正高唱着和德意同盟，同時又緊壓着越南而要求越南作爲其侵華與南進的軍事和經濟的根據地。法國現旣新經創傷，對日是可能尤其要求的。日本在南進上的成功，一定是擯斥·英·美於亞洲南洋，那末在利益的矛盾上當然會發生衝突。在這情形下，很明顯的一面是德·義·日·一面是中·英·美。這時影響所及，不僅兩個戰局會合成一個戰局，恐影響的範圍將更大。</p>
<p>現在再談第二個問題，在何種情形下起個別作用。也似乎像目前的情形。德·義之對日，老實說也看透了的。因此對日本的同盟並不感到大興趣。英國對日的態度，雖然在最近逮捕僑民的事件上，似乎很强硬；可是紳士的態度是最難捉摸的，在綏靖與妥協的政策下，可能對日讓步一點，而以全力對德。美國雖然禁運案形勢洶洶；可是在日本並不完全排斥美國於亞洲之外的時候，是不會有所發動的。這樣，遠東的局面，還是保持着目前的現狀，那末兩個戰局當然依舊起着個別作用。</p>
<p>最後我們再來推測這兩個問題，何者可能大？那末可說是後者可能大。原因：（一）德·義未至攻英棘手時，是不會有助於日本在亞洲的發動，這也就是說德·義·日的同盟目前還沒有到時期。（二）英國在這本土危殆之時定必傾全力以防德國的進犯，故日本如不過份緊壓，英在遠東讓步。（三）美國祇要日本不完全擯斥其利益於亞洲，是不會輕舉妄動的，（事實上，日對美也很顧慮）同時在大選前，羅總統對任何事當然都很謹愼。</p>
<p>末了，不能不提的，事實上中國的抗戰始終是與世界的任何事件有着聯繫性的，而抗戰的勝利，也唯決定於我們自己。</p>
<p>君平　遠東與歐局之連繫與否？在於日本之政策，倘日本聯德意而抗英美，毀英美在遠東之勢力，並以海軍助德意，則生連繫作用，倘日本僅欲乘機自利，而假聯意德爲名，則連繫似不可能，就目前情形觀之，日本必趨第二途，故連繫可能小而個別可能大。</p>
<p>白倫　遠東與歐局的戰爭原因與目的是各異，所以不能混爲一談，除非遠東的侵略國改變她的對外政策，和德義一樣同處於攻英地位時，遠東與歐局可能發生連繫作用，如果日本仍依以前的一貫政策，對於險局處於中立地位，觀望地位，那麼遠東是一個，歐局又是另外一個，各不相關。</p>
<p>以目前情勢推察國際間的將來，遠東與歐局的連繫性的可能是很小，第一，日本雖然又換上了近衛內閣，可是在對中國戰事尚未結束前，她決不致以武力進攻英國的，同時要堅持對中國戰爭，亦決不會過於忽視美國輿論的。第二，英國對德戰爭正待擴大時，英國爲保全自己力量，在經濟上武力上亦不會儘量來援助中國的，和日本在遠東取敵對政策的。</p>
<p>第四組答案</p>
<p>勞生　遠東和歐局在下列情形下，似將引起連繫作用：（一）日本加入軸心國對英作戰，以目前情勢看來，所謂加入軸心，僅是對英恫嚇之詞，日旣無實力參加歐戰，德對之亦殊冷淡；且德勢力業已發展，不容日本獨佔遠東利益。（二）英與德義戰爭達到決定階段。現階段的歐戰已呈僵持之勢；英海軍强大，德義攻英不易，英反攻亦難。在下列情形下，似將引起個別作用：（一）中國本身力量愈趨堅强。（二）遠柬反侵略陣綫團結加强。蘇聯援華，最爲積極。美禁運油鐵，已見寳行。日擬侵越攻華，德義亦不樂意；中法均將抵抗。以目前情勢推測將來，相對的說來：個別作用之可能，大于連繫作用。近來日本高唱所謂「亞洲門羅主義」及「東亞新秩序」，其意亦在屛除連繫作用；此爲日本徘徊于外交歧途上的現象，然在這國際情勢錯綜複雜的時代，無論情勢若何演變，決無絕對的個別作用；又以地域民族之各殊，亦無絕對的連繫作用；連繫與個別作用之影饗若何？亦不能作絕對的解釋。</p>
<p>慕秀　關于遠東與歐局發生聯繫之情形，可有數種：（一）日本加入軸心，積極南進，攫取香港，侵犯安南及南洋羣島；結果英日宣戰，（二）美國在遠東放棄堅決立塲；英國對日屈服；中英，英蘇關係惡化；亞歐兩洲成大陸集團，向英日開戰；（三）德蘇發生磨擦關係，破裂開始：日本在遠東夾攻蘇聯。反之，在下列各種情形下，則保留個別作用：（一）日本不積極南進；（二）中英，英蘇仍維友好關係；蘇聯仍保守中立，以目前情形推測，聯繫之可能性頗大，且係尤于第一種情形中。蓋日本陰謀乘火打刦，奪取英法荷屬地。其軍人深信德國必能經久耐戰，獲得勝利；對美國能否在遠東取積極態度，表示懷疑；故近日常向美試探，至于第一種聯繫之可能性似少；吾人不信英關將終于「賣友求榮」，蓋此舉不能阻止日人南進之野心，實屬愚蠢；此次對日之讓步，顯係延宕方策而已。此外英蘇關係，英國現正切思改善，無惡化之象，至於第三種情形，日前尙無端倪。</p>
<p>陳龍章　遠東和歐局在英美和日本發生戰爭行為時將起聯繫作用，在英美放棄遠東全部利益時將起個別作用。以目前情勢推測：（一）美國將逐步對日强化政策，但仍以不與日直接衝突爲前提（二）德國將大舉進攻英倫，當日本無法獲得美國軍需原料時，將於英倫危急但尚未崩潰的當兒，直取香港，進佔越南，並思攫奪荷印，香港將不抵抗而放棄，但日英海軍的敵對狀態就立刻存在了，進佔越南非海軍所能湊，但又須駐屯一二十萬陸軍，荷印資源豐富，攫奪荷印即可解除美國斷絕接濟之威脅，由此斷定：在日本攫奪荷印時，即為日美戰爭行爲發生的開始，亦卽是歐局和遠東聯繫的起點。</p>
<p>馮芳倬　假如日本參加軸心國作戰，則歐亞戰爭連為一體。前此各別發展之戰局，將成為空前的世界大戰爭。日本將在何種情况之下參戰呢？（一）英國妥協政策，顯示南洋防務的鬆懈。（二）美國實行自保西半球的門羅主義。（三）蘇日關係確賓獲得改善，然上濾除第一點外，二三兩點尙屬疑問，加之（一）無法結束中國事變（二）日本集團之經濟枯竭。（三）國內人心動搖。政情不安，雖近衛登台，革新體制，仍無効力，使日本有不能參戰之苦衷，而不得不採待機漸進政策，故在目前看，歐亞局勢，仍以各自發展之可能爲大。</p>
<h3>在聯繫局勢下，經濟界可能發生何種變化？在個別局勢下，經濟界又將形成何種局面？在這不同局勢下，中國經濟界如何才能適應環境？</h3>
<p>馮芳倬　如果日本參加德義方面作戰，則世界局勢將頓形改觀，不僅中英立於同一戰綫（專對日本），英美亦將進一步合作，其時（一）對日經濟封鎖，將在英美聯合姿態之下進行。（二）由於英美對華之援助增加，中國經濟地位益臻鞏固。（三）日將奪取中國沿海各租界及租借地，徹底摧毀外人在華之經濟勢力。反之，若日本不參入戰爭，遠東局勢，無極大之變動。則日方必（一）厲行對華經濟封鎖，（二）更嚴厲施行淪陷區經濟統制與剝削，（三）使淪陷區及沿海各埠外人及華人之經濟活動减至零點，（四）自由中國之經濟，將在自給自足的環境下，人民忍苦奮鬥之中，創立眞正民族資本的基礎。故無論國際局勢之變化若何？中國經濟界應徹底認淸其惟一出路：只有將資金盡量移向內地，投於各種新興事業，方可免於崩潰死滅之途。</p>
<p>蔣執誠　如果聯繫局勢，是指德意日軸心向英美的對抗，那末情形將相同於個別局勢下的經濟界。如果聯繫的局勢發展如英美德意日反蘇聯反民族解放的戰爭，那末經濟界將有重大的變化。</p>
<p>在前者情形下，參戰各帝國主義國家經濟在相對破壞中，而未涉戰禍的半獨立性的國家，（如芬·南·土及遠東近東落後民族）的民族經濟，因蘇聯的幫助，和帝國主義控制力的削弱，一般有獨立向上發展的可能。在後者情形下，整個世界經濟界將受嚴重破壞。</p>
<p>顯然，前者情形對我國民族經濟的發展有利，而後者則使我國民經濟感受嚴重威脅。爲了求得民族解放，應精誠國結，集全民之力，開發國民經濟，建設國防工業，聯合以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥。</p>
<p>王蕭　我以爲遠東與歐局的聯繫將是單面的，而不是全面的；但這對於世界經濟界的影響却並不重要。現在各進行戰爭的國家的經濟問題中，以原料問題爲第一；因之，經濟界的變化將是這樣：一方面各列强要加緊對已有的殖民地的榨取，另方面要加强對蘇聯的商務聯繫；（美國也不能免）這樣，蘇聯對世界經濟界的影響力將相對地提高。</p>
<p>至於中國，憑着三年來西南西北的開發，已稍具基礎；並且可以得蘇聯的幫助。因之，經濟界的表現是目力更生爲主，蘇聯援助爲副。</p>
<p>劉性初　遠東的中日之戰與歐洲的英國對德意之戰的能否轉變成聯繫？或是仍舊保持着個別的交戰狀態？這自然與世界的經濟趨勢有莫大之影響的。</p>
<p>由個別而達到聯繫，這就具體地說明了戰爭事態的由小而大，由單純而更進於複什；從而世界的經濟亦將由小毛病而趨於大困難，由局部的不安定，乃至釀成整個的大動亂矣。</p>
<p>因之，處在這樣一個變幻莫測的世界經濟激流中，中國的經濟界爲求適應這種艱難困厄的局面，必須排除往常依賴外來經濟勢力掖助的徼倖心理，卽使不然的話，亦只能將它置於次要的地位；方面加緊開發後方蘊藏的富源，積極築就經濟的寳庫。唯有這樣把自己立足於「自給自足」的鞏固經濟基礎之上，才能從容不迫地抵禦任何一切外來的經濟壓力。</p>
<p>茅乃成　在聯繫局勢下，因戰事擴大，各地工商業每因軍需關係不能保持常態；運輸不便，尤使各地物品，難以互相調劑，故物價自將發生嚴重增長。反之，若在個別局面下，物價雖不致驟增，然亦必漸加，至戰事範圍擴大，國際匯兌市塲行將引起極度混亂，更不待言。惟不論在何種局勢下，中國經濟界唯有「自力更生」，才能適應環境。</p>
<p>侶慧　聯繫局勢下：（甲）英美經濟勢力，結成一片；海上封鎖，遍及世界，商業益受障礙。（乙）因戰事期中，實施嚴格之封鎖及反封鎖，各國紛謀自給，統制貿易，國家經濟主義更形抬頭。（丙）各國採行通貨管理，統制黃金及外滙，牽入戰爭漩渦中者，更以軍費龐大之故，程度不同之通貨膨脹的跡象，逾益彰著。以上乙丙兩題，在個別局勢下，亦發生同樣之現象。</p>
<p>個别局勢下：（甲）美元集團，取代英鎊集團在世界上之地位。（乙）英德在南美之經濟勢力，轉移於美人之手；南北洲美洲可能結成一大經濟單位。（丙）蘇聯保守中立，力謀自身經濟之發展，於干戈紛擾中别樹一幟。（丁）日貨或將隴斷大部份之南洋市塲。</p>
<p>無論在個别抑聯繫局勢之下，外貨進口當然减少；我國自可乘機發展內地之工商農鑛等實業。不但成爲抗戰之後盾，且可進而奠立戰後我國建設之基礎。至於金融方面，我國之法幣，必要時應脫離英鎊而聯繫於美元。</p>
<p>石夫　在聯繫局勢下，外滙市塲影響最鉅。以次及於進口出口批發另售製造等各工商業。販賣業之影響，較製造業爲先，在個別局勢下，則販賣業與製造業所起變化之時間相同。金融界在任何局勢之下，總是站在第一條戰綫。</p>
<p>中國經濟界在聯繫局勢下，當首先統制外滙，取締投機囤積，限制物價，以求人民生活之安定。在個別局勢下，當以調整內部運輸機構，統制原料分配，硏究外來原料代用品，以求自給自足爲急務。至於利用廢物，勤勞節儉，努力生產等，均屬國民應盡之責也。</p>
<p>王紀澤　在較密切的聯繫局勢下，經濟界呈現的反應，最顯著的不外是：英鎊滙價大跌，國際金融市塲紛亂，統制經濟的厲行，國際運輸事業衰落，貿易銳减，商品的供求關係大變，物價隨着暴漲暴落，而美國在這情勢下，可能予英以更大的援助，對侵略國更施經濟壓力。</p>
<p>如荷印越南方面遭受侵略，經濟界所受的影響，與前者雷同，惟程度較差而已。</p>
<p>這兩種形勢，同樣警吿中國：自力更生是惟一的生路，加緊親蘇亦是當務之急；至各國嚴厲的統制經濟，外幣的降値貶値，促成海外資金的回國；尤其是滯留在滬上的資本家們，因國際形勢的混亂，將倍切的感到開發內地才是惟一的生路。</p>
<p>酈展濤　苟遠東與政局相聯繫，世界局勢，必因此改觀；而經濟方面，將隨二個軸心，形成二個經濟堡壘，此兩堡壘中，當以握有海空權者占優勢，蓋英美二大海空軍國家，在密切合作之下，必先絕敵方諸國在海空兩方之接濟與合作，且美國決心加入世界戰局，則登高一呼，響應者必多；故吾人以爲優勢屬於民主國方面；當非空鑿之言。其中影最受影響者爲日本。孤處遠東一隅，其危險誠有不堪設有者·中國處此局勢下，軍用品接濟必大增，在不變服萬變的策略下，中國仍可專心對日，經濟方面之加緊壓迫日本，尤屬急務也·歐局與远東，如仍舊各據一方，不生聯繫作用；則日本必將加緊侵華，以期早日結束戰事：得整頓國力，另謀别圖，在中國方面，若竟英美屈服於日本，多少不無影饗；惟一辦法，當以「自力更生」，在經濟上力謀自足，並努力破壞日本以戰養戰之計劃，另一方，加强中蘇關係，以助中國自給自足之遂行。至於歐局方面，因德義版圖之擴展，經濟資源之供給，可逐漸取給於征服諸國；於是影響所及，英美之處境將更困難。而美國現所擁有之大量黃金，如不卽予分配利導則雖不致無用但將來損失必鉅，似可懸測也。</p>

<h3>金融述評（續）</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—八月十七日—　管理銀行辦法</p>
<p>（二）按之第六條的規定銀行每旬應造存款表等，則應存的凖備金似乎以每旬存款餘額爲標準，則銀行所繳準備金至少每十月因存款增减而有多少。銀行爲日常收付起見，它的營業準備，決不能因繳存百分之二十的準備金而不準備。依照中國銀行年鑑一九三四—三六年銀行營業準備是由九—二三％，在戰時的情形，個人調查所得，純粹的庫存現金對活期存款的百分比不過約一〇％。可知本法施行之後，銀行所可自由運用的存款尙有十分之七之多，故必須對這銀行所可自由運用的十分之七的存款，以第三·四兩條去加以限制。</p>
<p>（三）關於本法的切實施行問題，在自由中國區域內，中國政府權力所及，毫無問題。但在上海則其可能實施的程度，頗可討論，有人認爲中國政治權力不及上海，能否推行，是一問題；卽能推行，陽奉陰違，如何實施第七條規定：一財政部得隨時派員檢查銀行帳册簿藉庫存……」，實則中國政治權力雖不能及於上海，但金融勢力還能支配上海金融界，故第二條實施不成問題。至於第三·四兩條，因財部不能在滬設立無適當的機關來執行檢查，似乎有點困難，這亦有方法可以解決，個人認爲財部如有實施的決心，可責令上海金融機構的中心組織，（如銀準會，錢準庫等），仰體當局的苦心，將第二條及第六條至第九條酌加更改，以適合環境的方法去實行，焉知本法不能收效於上海？</p>
<h3>滙市的變化</h3>
<p>上海的匯市自從七月末起，行市突見變化，一是法幣匯價的疲軟，一是自由英鎊的挫落。</p>
<p>法幣的匯價自七月二十六日起至八月十日止，由六元一二五直綫式地下降至五元四〇六二五，而十二日至十七日的一週，則自五元五三一二五成拋物綫式地上升至五元六二五。這一期間的降落趨勢八月一日以前緩和，而八月一日以後迅速。推求其原因，無非投機者借商業滙率的改訂，以過去它與黑市相差的事實作爲投機的根據；加以局勢的變化如日擬假道越南攻瘓，英國撤退駐華軍隊等，投機家遂作利多的扒結。進口商本來在期待外匯再行上漲，今見四便士半商業滙率的訂定，以爲外滙卽便再漲亦不會超過定價，且按四便士半與自由鎊價套算美金祇七元餘，在投機家誘發之下，乃有洋米煤油等大量美金結款，結果此次英金（由七月二十六日的三·八七五至八月十日的三·七〇三一二五）所昂不過百分之四，而美金則達百分之十二。</p>
<p>在上海的自由英鎊行市的波動，向來跟據紐約自由鎊價，但自七月十八日英國和美國協定取締自由英鎊之後，上海成爲自由英鎊唯一的自由市塲，故自七月二十二日起即與紐約自由英鎊脫離而下挫，二十四日至七月底的一個階段成拋物錢下降，八月一日至十日下降甚速，十二日起則見回升，紐約的自由鎊價，則盤旋上漲，八月十五日竟與英倫市價相同，下表略示自由英鎊在紐約與上海之變化：</p>
<p>紐約市場　上海市場</p>
<p>七月十八日　三·八一　三·七六七</p>
<p>二十日　三·九〇　三·八一二</p>
<p>廿二日　三·八一　三·七八</p>
<p>廿六日　三·八七　三·七六三</p>
<p>三十日　三·八二　三·七一五</p>
<p>八月三日　三·八八　三·六三</p>
<p>六日　三·九五　三·六四</p>
<p>九日　三·九八　三·五二</p>
<p>十四日　四·〇二　三·五二五</p>
<p>十五日　四·〇二五　三·五四五</p>
<p>十六日　四·〇二　三·五六五</p>
<p>上海的自由鎊價自七月二十六日至八月十日所跌約百分之八，卽美金約昂百分之十二，適與法幣匯價美金所昂程度相等，可知此次法幣匯價之疲軟，與自由鎊價之挫落，頗有關係也。（完）</p>

<h3>齋戒辨</h3>
<p>古來有齋戒之說，至今相沿未改，然今人但知齋戒，而不知其取義所在；僅以不食葷腥當之，失其義矣！古人之齋戒重以心，今人之齋戒飾以貌。禮云：「致齋七日，致齋三日，愛乎如有所見，愾乎若有所聞。」蓋其心之淸凈，空無一物，直可以通神鬼而格幽冥，豈若今之茹素者　，名曰齋戒，而實不知所齋不知所戒也。齋者取齋莊之義，齊不齊而致其齊，使此心瑩然無瑕，而後於齋字之意無愧。戒者取戒謹之義，反己自鏡，有無內疚，必使此心肅然不怠，而後於戒字之意無所妨，夫是故致齋於內，散齋於外，而所祭之人與吾心隱隱有所感召，今之齋戒者能如是乎！齋戒非不茹素，而非所爲茹素卽齋戒也。鄉黨記孔子齋必變食，朱子註之曰：「變食謂不飲酒，不茹葷。」如齊者不茹葷，莫不皆然，伺獨以此爲孔子異，可知古時之齋戒，容有茹葷者，而孔子獨變食，所以有如在之誠也。然孔子所以變食之意，亦仍取其淸明在躬，不敢肥膿腥臊雜於五內也·</p>

<h3>茶話</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>茶的地位：茶是開門七件事之一，它處的地位相當重要，「饑思食，渴思金飲」，是人之所不能缺的，貴客到門，別的可省，至少這一盞茶，是理應奉敬的。茶葉在我國前時，本為出口大宗，每年獲利，當相可觀，祇以製焙墨守舊法，不加改著，由是東西各國，很有研究種植茶樹，和最新焙製方法，來謀自給，以致我國的輸出額，逐漸減退，這是狠可惜的！</p>
<p>茶的類別：茶的種類相當的多，大別為紅綠兩種，隨各人的嗜好，分別飲啖，比較名貴的茶，當推雲南普洱，安微祁門，和珠蘭，香片等，而以我鄉的西湖龍井茶，四遠馳名，不過真正的龍井茶，在獅子峯若幹地畝產生，出品並不多，從前除呈貢大內和就近寺憎珍藏若幹，以餉大　越外，所餘有限至茶葉鋪雖以龍井號召顧客，強半魚目混珠，誰能辦其真假呢？據說真獅峯茶，經沸水泡後，是一　一槍的，而且有此好茶，更須名泉烹煮，如此色既翠綠可愛，味又芳冽醇厚，故杭諺有「龍井芽茶虎跑水」之語。</p>
<p>茶的功用：飯後喝茶，可助消化，清腸胃，當此炎暑，家中藏有　雪的，取雪水烹茶而飲，實為清暑妙品。據俗說：「茶葉有百　，獨益於目，」自慚無醫藥經驗，不敢武斷，但頗有人在晨起的時候，用泡過茶葉來據限請，說是可以明目的。我鄉有很多人家，每喜用泡淡茶葉，曬乾了用來裝枕，據說大有清腦之功。</p>
<p>茶的韻語：　（仝）陸（羽）七碗生風，古今播為美談，實則茶吃到七碗，也太多了。傳有所謂「神仙茶」，用上等名茶和以香品，置文火上細煎，使香味茶味融成一片，然後淺啜，香留舌本，此非有閑而有奇嗜者所能辦到。又有「女兒茶」一種，據說由二八嬌娃，採摘嫩芽，置於貼身布袋使幹，備出閣時，攜去夫家餉客，殊覺香艷。新雨初霧，午後庭院，溽暑半消，涼腮漸至，與知已二三人，閑鬥棋局，於鬟盈盈捧送香茗，用以敬客，雅典逸趣，如展畫圖，此種清福豈離亂中的人們，所得享受呢。</p>
<h3>關於改良女子服裝</h3>
<p>— 包星</p>
<p>本刊上期刊載了一篇金俠聞君的「改良女子服裝　議」，拜讀之餘，實在禁不住要發生奇矣哉的感想。</p>
<p>古代我國女子的衣服確是羅裙長袖，不過只是古代才如此，現在一般女子的服裝，也誠然是抽不及肘褲子蔽膝，不過也有所以造成這種風氣的事實上的條件。要拿羅裙長袖和袒臂露腿來比較，同時也必須顧到從前和現在的環境。要現在一般女子在服裝上蓋肘蔽膝，正仿佛要古時我國女子袒臂露腿一樣，是不可能而也不必的。</p>
<p>「改良女子服裝趨議」一文中，最使我感到詫異的，金君竟以為服裝於「人品之邪正」「門第之高低」會有關係。「門第」是不知幾十年前的腐物了。至於以服裝看作人品之邪正的標準，只有勢利眼的一些上海人才如此看法，其不應該是不用說的。金君這些見解，實在是十足的封建謬見！</p>
<p>雖然如此，在原則上，我是很贊同於女子現時服裝的改良的。不過，為行動的便利等理由，我以為不必蔽肘覆膝，成曲線的服裝也無何不可。在我眼中，現時的女子服裝，並不如金君文中所說的那樣不可取。不過，更進一步的改良確是需要的。</p>
<p>此時要很難想出具體的改良辦法，這是一個大問題，需要大家普遍地討論。這兒僅有的一些小意見是：尺寸的改變要算的次要，更重要的應當是式樣上的改良。</p>
<h3>廣西的「米粉」</h3>
<p>米粉是廣西省最普通的點心，先將米和水磨成稠密的米漿備放在鍋中蒸熟，然後放進一個榨器，榨出細條的米粉出來。廣西的米份分為兩種，一種是桂林米粉，另一種就是柳州米粉。</p>
<p>在桂林，米粉成了「飯」以外的主要食品，上至高級官員，下至擔　走卒都歡喜吃，所以非常普遍，米粉店比飯店多，每個角落裏都找得出一兩間，此外還有米粉擔子，由日間至深夜，都在街上流動式地做生意。</p>
<p>桂林米粉的粗細，　上海的大　差不多，由榨房榨出來後，擲成如雞蛋大的球形，線送到米粉店來。店裏有各種的燒烤鹵味，客人關照要什麼菜後，店員就著手調配，先將米粉約六球，放在一個有很多小孔的銅瓢內，浸入正燒沸的水中，約五分鐘取出，隨著將水濾去，倒進碗內，切好客人指定的菜鋪在米粉上面，再淋點熟油，鹵汁，放些油炸豆了就成了。從前是一角小洋一碗，現在加到二角大洋。廣西人歡喜吃辣椒，因此米粉店內的蒜泥辣椒是免費奉送的。</p>
<p>此外，桂林還有一種「屬肉米粉」，是很特別的。算是米粉店的副業、每年秋來冬初的時候，米粉店就有大張的紅紙條貼出來寫著「馬肉米粉上市」幾個字，於是顧客就比平日增加了幾倍。馬肉米粉是普通的米粉配以鮮湯和薄片鮮嫩的馬肉，它的特點就是味美而量少，五分錢一碗，兩啖就完了，但是一般的習慣吃法，起碼要吃十碗線算數，所以叫過了第一碗，送來之後，接著一碗一碗的送來，直到食客關照不要了為止。有很多人不吃飯，特地去吃馬肉的米粉，連吃三十多碗是極平常的事。</p>
<p>柳州的米粉比桂林的細，米粉店在柳州也是到入都有，當地人以米粉當做早點，中午以後雖然也有賣，可是生意就遠不及早上了。</p>
<p>早上的米粉是頂新鮮的，用新鮮的肉片，魚片，豬腰片，豬肝片浸入沸水中約二三分鐘取出，又鮮又嫩，倒入米粉，再加以鮮湯，味精，醬油，辣油，就可以吃了。價錢並不貴，每碗一角至二有。柳州人的愛吃米粉，猶如廣東人的愛上茶樓一樣，每早必到米粉店去，就是外地的人去到柳州，也要去嘗嘗　。</p>

<p>豆這樣東西，大概是多數人所愛吃的；而寶貴的維太命B，也豐富的很。新蠶豆的時期過去以後，老蠶豆可以曬幹，放在家裏，以備不時之需。老蠶豆的　通煮法，或量連殼　蘇了吃，（俗稱　酥豆）或是剝去了殼，加了切細的雪菜，作豆辦湯吃。再有個方法，就是去殼炻穌之後，加了雪菜絲或蔥花，鹽花，可以不用醬油，作豆辦沙吃，你要講究一些，使它變素為葷，那麼將鮮肉暫斬細，和豆辦沙拌在一起紅燒，那味兒自然益發可口了。</p>

<h3>長沙的商號</h3>
<p>— 海之奇</p>
<p>商號兩個字，在我們江南人聽來，這總是什麼買賣東西的商店。然而直到我前年到了長沙，才知道自己的猜想完全錯誤。原來所謂商號，就是「旅館」「旅社」「客棧」的另一個名稱。</p>
<p>隨著戰局的展開，戰區的擴大，逃難的人，像浪潮般地都推進到內地去。內地繁榮了，尤其是「吃食店」「商號」常常客滿。長沙的商號，在經濟方面，可以稱贊他一聲價廉，物美是談不上的。這些商號，大多數包著一宅較大的房子，因為那裏房租的便宜，開支很省。每個商號都有十個以上的房間，每個房間有二三只床鋪，光棧大都不甚充分，但也足夠解決住的問題。逃難人住此，也覺得它是安樂窩了。</p>
<p>商號是不供給行李的，每個旅客，都要自己帶被褥等進去。單身的旅客，還得和不認識的人合住一個房間。也有茶房，不過很少，除了倒茶水之外，別的不來過問。收費依個人為單位，低廉得幾乎使人們不敢相信，每天給你住宿茶水，還有三頓飯（不是照客數另碎開。一桌坐滿八個人，方才可以吃）每人每天最賤的時候只收大洋四角，後為漲到六七角。一些逃難人頓頓要嘗辣椒，吃慣了，倒也別有風味……</p>
<p>見到上海旅館的畸形發展，我覺得有寫出長沙商號的必要，作為一種參考，並且希望上海有真正平民化的，謀旅客便利的旅社設立。</p>

<h3>喧鬧的一夜</h3>
<p>— 同病</p>
<p>幾天前，擺水菓攤的阿昌他們幾位弟兄們，突然發起了募捐，一本黃草紙簿的正面，不齊整地寫上着「××里打醮善捐」等字樣，一家又一家，挨門按戶地。</p>
<p>「×師母，捐五元吧！」照例是阿昌的直捷的口吻。</p>
<p>「啥啦？這樣勢口……」</p>
<p>「一年一度，謀求太平格，……打醮捐呀！」</p>
<p>「晤！……一元吧。……你們眞熱心！……」</p>
<p>「謝謝！……」　全弄堂的人們代行佈施和祝福</p>
<p>一個整天的忙碌，阿昌他們的募捐工作，是吿功德圓滿了。全弄堂的人們，開始知道本弄的打醮又將舉行了，但日期還是在阿昌他們的計議中，只見他們顯露着興奮和欣幸……</p>
<p>是星期六的早晨吧，我們弄堂的前前後後，開始點綴起一些紙器來了，稻草繩牽繫着紙衣紙人紙帽之類，這給予整個弄居的人們又一種感覺，情緒煞然是緊張起來了。</p>
<p>孩子們尤其顯得高興，連連串串地，指東劃西，奔走不停，好個喧鬧。</p>
<p>一桌祭筵，舖設在弄東老虎灶的前面，祭席使人記起不如去年般的豐滿很多。早餐後就見有六個黃裟袈和尙圍坐在祭筵的四周，叮可噹，叮可噹，唸經和禮拜，他們正代我們。</p>
<p>晚上的情景，更像熱閙了。</p>
<p>在原先的祭筵之外，弄堂壓尾的那爿小吃舖的前庭，可加格起個臨時的板台，小食舖子臨時停止營業，客堂當作了後台，台上的短桌前，掛下了一面大紅繡花的桌被，「××舞台」四個金繡的字特別引動人家的觸目。「做戲哩。」這消息一會兒就傳遍了我們的里弄</p>
<p>開　的時候，這一個够長的弄堂，早已密密地排上了無數的板凳，觀衆都就是我們的弄居者，男女老幼，哄成一片，大家都目不暇接，坐視着臨時戲台上的演出。</p>
<p>紹興大班不比文戲般的幽靜，銅鑼大鼓等一全套，交雜嚮作時着實够人煩厭！但觀衆之間，有的雖不是紹屬人們，却也都耐於聽演，鼓掌聲，喝彩聲，……居然也繞樑三匝！</p>
<p>這樣鬧猛熱烈的塲面，一直繼續到第二天的淸晨－四點鐘，紙器化了，祭筵撤了，觀衆抱着疲備的身軀散去了，「太平公醮」終於是整個「功德圓滿」了。</p>
<p>這一天要睡的人們，首先起了咒詛：</p>
<p>「一整夜沒曾合眼過，作孽！作孽！……」</p>
<p>「這樣勢口，居然還窮作樂，！……」</p>
<p>自然阿昌是被認作最可厭惡的一個，但當他在午後搓著眼皮滿口「吃力」的歡苦聲中，吿訴大家，此次打醮經濟超出了預算，他的一個小小的水菓攤，這回竟給賠本了四十元錢呢。</p>
<p>「眞是勞神傷財！」大家都有些懊喪了。</p>
<h3>生活與事業</h3>
<p>— 千飛</p>
<p>表面看來，生活與事業，似乎是有其連繁性的。人生於世，誰都具有求生之欲望，因了事業是維持生活的因素，所以人人皆須有事業；無事業的人，也千方百計的尋求事業。不過，如若嚴格的講，生活是生活，事業是事業，實是不可混着、一談的。所謂事業也者，應該是對於社會有貢獻，於人羣有利益，始能稱爲事業。若一般祇顧個人生活滿足，不惜幹危害公益釣事，這能說是事業嗎？</p>
<p>我們常聽見有人說：「這人所幹的事業多麽偉大啊！」其實事業根本無所謂偉大不偉大的，因爲事業吿是偉大的，不偉大的事業，也就無價値可言，試問旣够不上事業之價値，焉能稱事業二字？</p>
<p>一個人欲求生活，而謀事業，應注重事業之價値。事業有價値，生活才有意義，於人於已，皆蒙其利；事業無價値，雖私人生活可以無憂，或竟可較他人優越，但這種人在社會上是蠶虫，在人羣是害馬，這種人雖生猶死，遺論生之實義！</p>
<p>將求生目的認錯了的人，應該及早回頭，試看很多爲事業而犧牲的人，他們紙東事業成就，個人生活，是早卽置之度外的，任憑生活怎樣刻苦，對於事業却埋頭苦幹，他們爲什麽不去找可使生活比較安樂的所謂事業來幹呢？他們是爲的公衆的生活啊！他們所幹的事業，是能使大家的生活安樂，所謂「獨樂樂，不如衆樂樂」。他們曉得，唯有共同過着安樂的生活，才是眞正的安樂，眞正可得到生活意義。</p>
<p>事業是生活的保障，不能保障生活的事業，生活是不能長久的，深明大義的人，在事業未能成就，生活未有保障之前，決不顧及生活的，必須致力於保障生活的事業上，事業穩固了，然後生活始可安定，永久樂安。不過我並不是說，叫人將生活置之不理了，因爲向事業努力，實在就是爭取生活。世界上儘多榦着大事的人，在不能顧及私生活的環境下，決不肯違背現實丢掉事業而顧及生活的。如若違背了這定律，事業就無成功之日，雖生活暫可安定，却如失舵之舟，失去保陣，隨時有傾覆之虞。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>我回到他的寓所的時候，已是十一點鐘，問問施桂，霍桑竟毫無香信。倪金壽却來過一個電話，也是問震桑有沒有回寓。</p>
<p>我自言自語說：「奇怪，他剛才和霍桑接過電話，怎麽又來問他？「我又問施桂說：」倪探長的雷話什麽時候打來的？」</p>
<p>施桂答道：「大概有一刻多鐘了。」他似乎因着我臉上的表示，也有些兒着急。</p>
<p>我又問道：「他可曾說什麽話？」</p>
<p>施桂搖頭道：「沒有，他聽得我說霍先生沒有回來，馬上把電話擱斷，好像很着急。包先生，你跟他在什麼地方分手的？可會有什麼事？」</p>
<p>我來不及把經過的情形吿訴施桂，忙趕到電話機旁，打到警著裏去，找倪金壽談話。我得到的回音，頓時使我的神經緊張起來。</p>
<p>那警署中的接綫員答道：「倪探長出去了，大槪還不到半個鐘點。」</p>
<p>我又問：他可曾說往那裏去？」</p>
<p>「沒有，他出去時很忽促，並且有些兒奇怪。」</p>
<p>「奇怪？怎樣奇怪？」</p>
<p>「他好像在跟霍先生接談，談的時間倒不少。可是那談話沒有結局，倪探長就忽忽拿了手槍出去。」</p>
<p>我自己覺得我的心頭跳動得很快，呼吸也加增了速度。但我仍維持着我的談話。</p>
<p>「你說得明白些。怎麼說沒有結局？」</p>
<p>「倪探長向聽筒中連連喂了幾聲，彷彿霍先生那邊的電話突然中斷。倪探長臉色很緊要張，便擱好電話筒，急忙忙拿了一支手槍放在衣袋裏，就趕出去。」　（八〇）</p>
<h3>裁員·减薪</h3>
<p>— 任明</p>
<p>目下有許多商店，藉言生意清淡，要兇省開支，準備裁員，减薪。</p>
<p>這是免不了的事，物價抬得無法再高，一般人都缺乏購買力，可以省去的用品，人們都不急急地買了，當然生意不會好。</p>
<p>股東經理們不應太自私，在生意興隆的當兒，擴充當業，添了很多的職員，賺得一筆錢，小職員們沾光極少。如今生意不佳，也當顧全同人的生活，在可能的範圍中，竭力維持。</p>
<p>不論資本家，小職員，在有錢可賺時，不可任意揮霍，如能節省些，若是遇到關店，蝕本，减薪，失業時，也可少受些痛苦了！</p>

<h3>Japan's New Demands on Vietnam: French Cabinet Meets to Discuss; Foreign Minister Also Extends Talks with Chinese and Japanese Ambassadors and US Chargé d'Affaires; Large Numbers of Japanese Infiltrate Vietnam Under the Guise of Inspection Teams</h3>
<p>Vichy: French Foreign Minister Baudouin, after attending a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss new Japanese demands regarding military and economic concessions in Vietnam, immediately consulted with the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors. Baudouin met with Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun and Japanese Ambassador Sawada, and after the meeting, he went to discuss the matter with US Chargé d'Affaires Murphy. The French Ambassador to Japan has announced that Japanese experts have already arrived in Vichy and Tokyo. Negotiations regarding Vietnam can therefore proceed simultaneously. The Franco-Japanese negotiations, after the Governor-General of Vietnam, General Catroux, rejected Japanese demands, have been moved from Hanoi to Vichy. Governor-General Catroux advised the Japanese to negotiate directly with the Vichy government regarding these demands. It is reported that Japanese demands include allowing Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, occupying several Vietnamese airfields, and using Cam Ranh Bay, Haiphong, and Baidalong as naval bases. The Japanese economic demands include allowing Japan to enjoy tariff exemptions and passport-free entry rights. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: People here today are increasingly concerned about the large number of Japanese infiltrating French Indochina under the guise of members of Japanese inspection teams and various other pretexts. People here deeply fear that these Japanese are engaged in large-scale survey work, as well as drawing maps of land and sea military bases and return routes. However, the Japanese have not yet carried out political propaganda among the natives. Since the Governor-General of Vietnam, General Catroux, adopted a firmer stance, the site of Franco-Japanese negotiations has been moved from Hanoi to Vichy. All kinds of issues between France and Japan regarding Vietnam will be negotiated in Vichy. Although Governor-General Catroux rejected Japanese demands, Japan will resubmit its demands to the Vichy government and discuss the matter with Germany. Governor-General Catroux refused the Japanese demands with the consent of the Vichy government. This tense situation has been somewhat eased. The concern over the invasion of Vietnam has decreased since Lieutenant Colonel Sato left. Sato was the drafter of the Japanese demands and the leader of the Japanese army in Guangzhou, who has always advocated passing through Vietnam to invade Chongqing. When Major General Nishihara returned to Japan, Lieutenant Colonel Sato served as the acting head of the Japanese inspection team stationed in Vietnam. Another reason for the easing of the situation here is that the authorities refused to allow two Japanese torpedo laying ships and a merchant ship to unload large quantities of munitions, and to allow Japanese naval personnel disguised as passengers to land. Japanese demands on the Vietnamese government include: (1) the right for Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; (2) the occupation of several airfields; (3) the right for Japanese troops to use the naval bases of Haiphong, Cam Ranh, and Baidalong. At the same time, the demands of the Japanese economic investigation team were also partially rejected. The Japanese demanded the right to enter Vietnam without paying tariffs and without needing passports, as other countries do. Currently, economic negotiations have been temporarily suspended pending negotiations between the French organizing committee and the Japanese economic investigation team. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Foreign Minister Baudouin received Chinese Ambassador Dr. Gu Weijun, US Chargé d'Affaires Murphy, and Japanese Ambassador Sawada today in succession. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Vichy: French Foreign Minister Baudouin received Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun, the Japanese Ambassador, and the US Chargé d'Affaires yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Responsible officials here today denied to a Reuters reporter the news circulating in Vichy that Chinese troops were attempting to cross the Vietnamese border, and said that there was no truth to the claim that the Vietnamese authorities had lodged a protest. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to semi-official news from Hanoi, the Vietnamese authorities have protested to the Chongqing government about the attempt by Chinese troops to cross the border. It is reported that this attempt has been blocked. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to an official statement here, the French government received a report from Hanoi, Vietnam, stating that several units of Chinese troops attempted to cross the Sino-Vietnamese border yesterday and were repelled by French troops stationed there. In addition to taking precautionary measures, the French colonial authorities have lodged a protest with Chongqing. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Major General Nishihara, the Japanese supervisor stationed in Vietnam, hosted a grand banquet at the Duxton Hotel here yesterday to entertain important figures from France and Japan. Those present included the Secretary-General of the Governor-General of Vietnam's Office, the Director of Political Affairs, the Director-General of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway (French), and the Japanese Consul-General in Hanoi, Suzuki. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Send Respects to Chiang</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Overseas Chinese in Cochinchina, Vietnam, recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects and express their condolences to the soldiers. The telegram stated, in brief: "Upon hearing the news, we are delighted to learn of the Chinese army's victory, laying the foundation for final victory. We respectfully donate 3,300 Vietnamese dollars, equivalent to 10,000 yuan in national currency, to express our condolences to the soldiers who have contributed to the war of resistance." (Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Ship Fooshan Still Not Released</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: The British authorities previously detained the Taikoo Fooshan, a steamship, in Guangzhou due to a dispute over pilotage fees. On August 8, they refused to allow the Japanese ship SHIROGANE Maru to enter Hong Kong. Yesterday, a Hong Kong telegram reported that the matter was about to be resolved, and that both the Japanese ship and the Fooshan had sailed from Guangzhou to Hong Kong on Sunday. However, when a Reuters reporter asked an official at the British Consulate here about this news, the official replied that he had only just heard about it. The agent of Taikoo Company also stated that, to his knowledge, this news was not accurate. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Shandong Charge into Qidong City, Engage in Fierce Street Battles with Japanese Troops; Japanese and Puppet Warehouses and Offices All Destroyed</h3>
<p>A certain place in Shandong: On the night of the 8th, Chinese troops in northern Shandong launched a surprise attack on the Japanese entrenched in Qidong County (northeast of Jinan) and stormed the city in one fell swoop. They engaged in fierce street battles with the Japanese, fighting hand-to-hand until the morning of the 9th. Most of the Japanese were annihilated, and all Japanese and puppet offices and warehouses were completely destroyed by the Chinese. Subsequently, the Japanese divided their forces to reinforce Qidong and counterattack. The Chinese immediately intensified their efforts to mop up the remaining Japanese in the city, while also engaging the Japanese reinforcements. As of the evening of the 9th, the fighting was still ongoing. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, arrived in Hong Kong by ship from Shanghai on the 18th. He told reporters that after Nanjing issued the so-called wanted order, he remained in Shanghai for public and private affairs, enduring hardships and difficulties. However, outsiders claimed that he had succumbed and severed ties with the central government, which is not worth a knowing person's laugh. His trip to Hong Kong was to report on the current situation in Shanghai to relevant parties, and he would be staying in Hong Kong for an extended period. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rumored Japanese-Thai Negotiations</h3>
<p>Before commenting on this topic, please allow me to briefly state one or two things: There are only three independent countries in the Far East: China, Japan, and Siam (now renamed Thailand). The essence of Japan's aggression against China is to swallow it whole and destroy it. After three years of war with no success, Japan was forced to seek a secondary goal: to preserve the name of China while actually seizing its sovereignty, making China a vassal state and no longer an independent country. China, however, is continuing its war of resistance for survival. Japan's grand ambition is to become the sole independent country in the Far East, which means it cannot tolerate the existence of a second independent country in the Far East. Therefore, while aggressing against China, it is also putting pressure on Thailand.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many reports that Japan has made harsh demands on Thailand, including four points: First, Japan's naval and land forces must be allowed to establish bases in Thailand; second, Japan's land forces must be allowed to use Thai railways; third, Japan and Thailand must sign a mutual assistance agreement; and fourth, the naval and land forces of the two countries must cooperate closely. If the reports are true, then Japan's tentacles of southward expansion have rapidly extended from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean. Previously, Japan's capture of the Hainan Islands and the Yongqin area, and its harsh demands on French Vietnam and British Burma, could be excused by the needs of the war of aggression against China, thus concealing its true desire for southward expansion. As for Thailand, its territory is not adjacent to China, and in the conflict between China and Japan, it is clearly leaning towards Japan. Even so, Japan is still putting pressure on Thailand, proposing terms that would make it a vassal state. This can only be interpreted as preparing to engage in a major war in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean, driving Western countries out of the Far East, and no other pretext can be used to explain it.</p>
<p>Singapore, known as the Gibraltar of the East, is the British Empire's strongest base in the Far East. When the naval base opened in February 1938, British Governor Thomas said, "Singapore is the greatest guarantee of peace, a guarantee against war." This was not an exaggeration, because the strength of this fortress is indeed sufficient to deter any aggressor. However, Singapore also has its inherent weaknesses. Its main vulnerability comes from the threat from the Siam side. Because the Malay Peninsula across from Singapore is only connected to South Asia by a narrow strip of land, without any natural barriers. Therefore, Thailand's movements are sufficient to determine the military value of the Singapore fortress. If the long-discussed plan to dig the Kra Canal is realized, it will not only shift the trade routes of the Far East, but also change the defensive situation of the Malay Peninsula, even causing the Singapore fortress, painstakingly built by Britain, to lose its function. Although Britain has fortifications in the Kra area, if Thailand joins the enemy of Britain, the crisis faced by Burma, India, and all British territories in the Far East will be beyond the capabilities of its current military deployment in the Far East. If Japan does not intend to conflict with Britain, then it is already done. If it is determined to destroy British interests in the Far East, then it will inevitably spare no effort to pressure Siam to join its ranks in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Regardless of the truth of the aforementioned rumors, the Japanese warlords, while exerting pressure on French Vietnam, will not let go of Thailand, which is even more important than Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Thai government and people are not entirely unaware of this crisis. They have tried to please Japan, but have also tried to avoid irritating Britain and France. The call for the construction of the Kra Canal has been intermittent and has not yet been implemented, precisely for this reason. However, Thailand's comparative inclination towards the Axis powers and Japan is an undeniable fact. In order to comply with Japanese demands, it has repeatedly suppressed the patriotic movements of overseas Chinese, and closed down Chinese newspapers and schools. Although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to the Thai authorities to advise them, it only slightly modified its appearance and did not abandon its tyrannical policies. Now Japan does not appreciate Thailand's many years of pleasing it, and its friendship that far exceeds fairness, but for the need for expansion, it does not hesitate to regard Thailand's sovereignty as nothing. Speaking frankly, this is Japan's true face, and there is nothing to blame it for; but in Thailand, it is merely self-abasement, which can be said to be self-inflicted. Originally, among the few remaining independent countries in Asia, Thailand's politics, although not very enlightened, its efforts to improve are still commendable; but in recent years, its rulers have failed to recognize the big picture, not wanting to seek survival under right and justice, but instead indulging the atrocities of the aggressors, treating the neighboring countries seeking liberation as strangers, and even overestimating themselves, picking up the teeth of modern aggressive countries, fantasizing about using the blood ties of the Thai people to realize their dream of encompassing the South Asian continent, and refusing to merge with the mainstream of the Eastern national liberation movement to protect the common rights and interests of the weak. Its ignorance is laughable, and its future destiny is pitiable.</p>
<p>Such conditions as mentioned above are hardly acceptable to any country with a slight sense of justice and self-respect. Vietnam is only one of France's many colonial units, and now that its home country has been defeated, it is unwilling to see its local sovereignty being divided; then Thailand, even if it claims to be pro-Japanese, at this critical moment of master-slave honor and disgrace, should not be more docile to Japan than French Vietnam. Moreover, Thailand's territory is close to India, Burma, and Malaya, surrounded on three sides by British and German forces. If it offends its powerful neighbors for the sake of pleasing distant allies, it is inevitable that there will be consequences. Therefore, even if Britain suffers a terrible defeat in Europe, as long as it is not a fundamental collapse of the empire, Japan may not be able to easily satisfy its great desires in Thailand. Whether it will act recklessly and hastily depends entirely on how the international situation in the Far East and the situation of the Sino-Japanese war develop thereafter. Although Thailand and its neighboring British and French territories should be aware of this, they must take unified steps to protect themselves, and should not follow the path of trying to put out a fire by pouring boiling water on it, creating a source of trouble. The Thai authorities must especially reconsider their consistent stance and foreign policy, and must especially recognize the value and significance of China's war of resistance for the weak and small nations of the East.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Summary of Operations for the Week of August 11-17</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that in the past week (August 11-17), the fighting was more intense in Guangxi, Guangdong, and southern Shanxi, while there were also scattered battles on other fronts. Chinese soldiers and officers, fighting hard, repeatedly achieved brilliant results. The more important aspects of the operations are described below.</p>
<p>Guangxi and Guangdong</p>
<p>The Japanese entrenched in Longzhou in southern Guangxi launched a fierce offensive to the west in the past week. After the Chinese forces met them head-on and engaged in fierce battles, the Shuikou and Pinger passes were once lost. When large reinforcements arrived, they rose up in a counterattack, and the Japanese forces collapsed towards Longzhou. Both passes were recaptured, and there are no Japanese traces west of Longzhou. At the same time, Chinese forces attacking Xiangjin (east of Longzhou) completely recovered the county seat after clearing out the stubborn Japanese. This move poses a great threat to the Japanese forces in Longzhou, and they are now extremely panicked. As for the Chinese forces in southern Guangdong, they launched a fierce attack on Guantang, Fuhexu, and Guanyintang near Zengcheng on the morning of the 11th, and once broke into the Japanese positions, engaging in street battles. Most of the Japanese were annihilated. After the Japanese reinforcements launched a counterattack, they were once again repelled by the Chinese at the Aotou, Fengchi, and Dabuling lines. By noon, all of the Japanese had been repelled by the Chinese. In this battle, the Japanese suffered more than a thousand casualties, and the Chinese captured countless spoils. This was the Chinese army's biggest victory on the Guangdong front in the past month.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Henan</p>
<p>The Japanese in the triangular area of southwestern Shanxi have repeatedly attacked recently, but have been repulsed each time. At noon on the 10th, the Japanese gathered more than a thousand infantry and artillery troops and attacked Huangjia (southwest of Yu County). A unit of Chinese troops blocked them at Nanling, while another elite force detoured around the right flank and launched a surprise attack on the Japanese rear. After fierce fighting until night, the Japanese collapsed towards Nanguocun (north of Huangjia Kiln). The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and recapture Nanguocun. The Japanese fled to Yu County, abandoning many corpses, weapons, and ammunition. In addition, the battles in Xinhe, Fencheng, and Yongji were also fierce in the past week. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and all Japanese strongholds are now under Chinese control. Chinese forces in Henan have launched fierce attacks on the Japanese in Xinyang in southern Henan and Qinyang in northern Henan in recent days, scoring repeated victories.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>Chinese forces on the west bank of the Xiang River in Hubei have launched attacks on the Japanese in the Dangyang and Jingmen areas in the past week. After one route defeated the Japanese who came out, they forced their way to the outskirts of Dangyang City, killing hundreds of Japanese. Another route wiped out the remaining Japanese northeast of Jingmen, completely clearing the areas of Lexiangguan, Wangjiaji, Yunwuguan, and Dengjiazui. They are now attacking the county seat. In addition, a unit of Japanese forces on the outskirts of Yichang City once harassed the north, but has been repulsed. At the same time, a unit of Japanese forces trapped in Mojishan (across from Yichang) tried to break out, but failed. The Chinese are still gathering to annihilate them. On the Hunan front, the Japanese in Yueyang have repeatedly attacked Zhujiatan, east of Taolin, in recent days, but have been repulsed each time, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The fighting has now subsided.</p>
<p>Shandong and Jiangsu</p>
<p>Chinese forces in southeastern Shandong have been very active in recent days, constantly attacking the Japanese and scoring many victories. They have completely destroyed the Japanese highways (1) from Taibei, Weifang, Zhucheng, to Guanshi Town; (2) from Muling Pass to Shenlin Shop, and from Daguan to Muling Pass; and (3) the transportation between Ju County and Ji'nan City. Another unit of Chinese troops simultaneously destroyed many bridges on these highways, disrupting Japanese transportation and causing great panic. The Chinese army is continuing to attack the Japanese. The Japanese entrenched in Huai'an and Baoying in northern Jiangsu have launched attacks on Baxianbu (north of Baoying) and the Erbao Fortress in Yuhan Cave (south of Huai'an) from both land and water in the past week. The Chinese intercepted them head-on, and another unit attacked the Japanese rear, completing the encirclement. After several days of fierce fighting, nearly a thousand Japanese were killed, more than twenty Japanese boats were sunk, and many war horses and military supplies were captured. In addition, Chinese forces on Chongming Island in southern Jiangsu destroyed a Japanese factory and laid mines, destroying many Japanese military vehicles and killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In addition, (1) there have been battles in the vicinity of Bengbu and Suxian in northern Anhui, and Nanchang, Wu'ning, and Anyi in northern Jiangxi, with the Chinese killing many Japanese; (2) Japanese warships have continued to harass the coast of Zhejiang Province, but have been repulsed each time; the Japanese who landed on a small island in Taishan, Guangdong, are being surrounded and annihilated by Chinese forces; and (3) Japanese planes have repeatedly attacked Sichuan, but more than a dozen have been shot down or damaged by Chinese forces. These are all important victories in the past week. In addition, many Japanese soldiers on the Nanchang front, including Mizubo Mitoro, have recently surrendered to the Chinese. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Shanxi Attack Changcun</h3>
<p>Xingji: On the night of the 11th, a unit of Chinese troops attacked Changcun Town (northeast of Tunliu), killing many Japanese. Another unit besieged the newly built Japanese station in Changcun and Changzhi, capturing many Japanese and destroying several Japanese cars. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese attacked Liangtai Mountain in multiple routes, but were completely repulsed by the Chinese. (Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Xingji: There have been continuous heavy rains in southern Shanxi in recent days, causing mountain floods. Japanese transportation along the Quwo, Fengxian, and Tongpu lines has been destroyed in many places. At noon on the 13th, a Chinese sabotage team destroyed a Japanese Nankai train near Dongzhen, including one locomotive and three carriages. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the afternoon of the 11th, more than a thousand Japanese troops in Qinyang took cars to Weicun. After being detected by Chinese troops, they set an ambush and opened fire as soon as the Japanese arrived. The Japanese panicked and fled, destroying many Japanese cars, killing many Japanese, and capturing a lot of spoils. (Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Guangdong Close in on Zengcheng</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese communique, Chinese forces in southern China have made a major advance. Chinese forces have cut off the highway between Shitan and Zengcheng, and have approached Zengcheng, where the Japanese have a strong garrison. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Near Yichang Fail in Northern Attack</h3>
<p>Zigui: Japanese troops near Yichang have recently sent troops north to harass the Dongjin area, but have been intercepted by Chinese troops. The Japanese were badly hit and retreated. The Chinese are taking advantage of the victory to pursue and annihilate them. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Germany Implements Counter-Blockade Against England; England Believes It Is Extremely Difficult to Enforce; Full Preparations Made for Any Development; British Admiralty Issues Notice Regarding Dangerous Navigation Areas</h3>
<p>London: The British Information Department issued a statement in response to the German command's announcement of a complete blockade of Britain, saying that Germany's accusations of Britain violating naval warfare regulations were hypocritical, as Germany had already violated all regulations. Germany's attempt to blockade Britain was not new, and it had already used its full power to attack neutral ships. A total of 736,162 tons of neutral shipping had been sunk, but this had not prevented neutral shipping from seeking British escort. Germany's brutal actions against neutral shipping had not been effective and would not be now. Most of the former neutral ships are now serving Britain, including 82 percent of Norwegian ships, 90 percent of Dutch ships, 83 percent of Belgian ships, and 60 percent of Danish ships. The German authorities are now reiterating their long-standing threats, likely for other reasons. Perhaps Germany wants to use the threat of a counter-blockade to divert Britain's attention. It should be known that Britain is fully prepared for any development. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>London: It was learned last night from responsible sources in Dublin that the Southern Irish government had received a letter from Germany stating its decision to implement a strict blockade against England. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>London: The British Admiralty announced the following locations as dangerous navigation areas: (1) The English Channel east of a line from the Casquets lighthouse to Cap Gris Nez; (2) The Bay of Biscay east of a line from Cap Gris Nez to the Leixoes lighthouse. Ships traveling to British ports in the English Channel must consult with naval management officials in British ports for sailing routes, and with British consuls in foreign ports. Those who travel further assume responsibility for the risks. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Germany Designates Blockade Zone; Lays Mines Along the English Coast</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials today announced the boundaries of the blockade zone around Britain: from latitude 47 degrees 10 minutes north, longitude 4 degrees 40 minutes west off the Atlantic coast of France, to latitude 45 degrees north, longitude 5 degrees west, to latitude 45 degrees north, longitude 20 degrees west, to latitude 58 degrees north, longitude 20 degrees west, to latitude 62 degrees north, longitude 5 degrees east, then back to the Belgian coast, to the starting point. This blockade zone is smaller than the dangerous area defined by President Roosevelt, which included the Norwegian coast. Furthermore, this blockade zone only affects Britain and neutral Ireland, and it differs from both Britain's blockade plan and Roosevelt's dangerous area. (Haitong telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday afternoon, three giant ships triggered mines near the island of Moen. Two of them have already sunk, and the third was severely damaged and cannot sail. On the 16th, the German Air Force went to British territorial waters and dropped mines along the coastal ports. The sea lanes from the high seas to the British coast are now heavily mined. The St. George's Channel, the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and other British territorial waters have all become dangerous areas, making navigation extremely difficult and dangerous. When a group of German aircraft bombed the Bristol Channel on the 16th, the ports suffered heavy losses, disrupting shipping. Ships are now diverting to other routes. The docks and wharves of the ports of Avonmouth, Newport, Cardiff, and Swansea were bombed. Ships are now diverting to ports in the St. George's Channel. (Haitong telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>American Ships Refuse to Change Course; Disregard German Warnings</p>
<p>Berlin: According to an official report released here last night, the German and American governments have exchanged documents regarding the American troop transport ship "American Legion" sailing back to New York from Petsamo. The German government pointed out that the American transport ship had entered the operational zone around Britain on the 14th of this month. The German government then warned the "American Legion" to change its course when sailing back to the United States to avoid entering the dangerous zone. If the ship does not comply and consequently encounters a dangerous incident, the responsibility should be borne solely by the American government. (Haitong telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. State Department yesterday refused to change the sailing route of the American transport ship "American Legion" from Petsamo, disregarding German warnings. The German side warned that it would not be responsible for the loss of the ship on its current route. State Department officials claimed that the American refugee ship could not find other safe routes, and the food stored on board was running low. The refugee ship carries a Norwegian princess and her two children, as well as 1,100 other European refugees. (Associated Press telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers this morning published articles attacking the American decision to allow its refugee-laden mail ship "American Legion" to continue sailing along its original announced route. According to the "Vossische Zeitung," Germany, in announcing a complete blockade of Britain, has specifically pointed out that the waters around the British Isles are heavily mined and are a constant battlefield for air and sea warfare. It is extremely easy for American ships to switch to a less dangerous route. The State Department's decision is difficult to understand. (Associated Press telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Blockade: Full Text of the Announcement</h3>
<p>Berlin: At 4:00 PM yesterday, German officials released a document announcing the complete blockade of Britain, stating that since the outbreak of war, Britain's violations of international laws of war have expanded. Britain first declared food to be contraband, violating basic human laws. German women and children were the first to be affected, just as in the Great War. Then, it declared all German goods contraband, including goods owned by neutral countries and those transported out of Germany on neutral ships. Other illegal measures included arming merchant ships and abusing neutral flags. Germany's response to the first measure was to import large quantities of food and raw materials from various regions of Europe and Asia. Its determination was to sink five million tons of enemy merchant ships and destroy 1.5 million tons of merchant ships, making them unusable, for a total of 6.5 million tons. Britain, seeing the failure of naval warfare, resorted to more cruel methods, such as laying drifting mines, using merchant ships for combat, and using fishing boats as submarine traps. On May 9th of this year, Churchill declared in the British House of Commons that all German merchant ships would be sunk during the day, and merchant ships of any country would be attacked at night. As a result, neutral ships have suffered deeply. Large numbers of merchant ships from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France have been forcibly seized by Britain. Furthermore, mines have been laid across the entire sea surface from Greenland to Britain, forcing neutral ships to enter British ports and be used by Britain. In addition, ships from non-belligerent countries such as Japan, the Soviet Union, and Sweden have been intercepted, and so-called naval certificates have been used to control the trade of neutral countries. Ships without certificates are considered war prizes. However, since the fierce sea and air battles began, Britain's overseas trade has been interrupted. The neutral ships that are still sailing are escorted and directed by British warships, with no freedom whatsoever. Britain's measures completely disregard international law, designating the seas around it as a war zone. Under the pressure of the German military, Britain has now openly broken the bounds of civilized warfare. A few days ago, Churchill declared that German Red Cross aircraft rescuing downed airmen would be shot down in the future. This shameless means proves that the British rulers, seeing the approach of defeat, are making this final struggle. In recent air battles, two German Red Cross aircraft were shot down by British aircraft while rescuing injured British airmen. Germany gave Britain several months to restore its reason, but to no avail. Britain refused Chancellor Hitler's appeal. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to retaliate with force. On September 26th of last year, Chamberlain said that Germany was a fortress, so it was legal to cut off all supplies to the Germans. In other words, Britain considers it legal for German women and children to starve to death. Fortunately, due to the victory of the German army, food and raw materials from all parts of the world are flowing in, and Britain's conspiracy has failed. Germany has now proven that Britain is a besieged fortress, not Germany. Germany is now blockading the entire UK as a response to Britain's attempt to starve German women and children, and firmly believes that this move is a further step towards ending the war and removing the British criminals. Britain, seeing the failure of its blockade of Germany, has turned to blockading the whole of Europe. Countries such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal have all been harmed. Therefore, Germany's actions today are for the benefit of the whole of Europe. Therefore, forcing Britain to surrender and removing its rulers is an urgent task for all of Europe and all neutral countries. The United States and Argentina have already declared British waters a war zone and prohibited their ships from entering, but other countries have not yet taken the same steps. Germany has repeatedly requested that all countries forbid their ships from entering the British-German war zone. For the benefit of all countries, it is hoped that they will comply with Germany's request. The German government now wishes to solemnly declare the following: The naval warfare around Britain is in full swing. The entire area has been heavily mined. German aircraft will attack every ship. Neutral ships entering these waters will also be destroyed. From now on, the German government will not be responsible for any damage to ships or loss of life in these waters. If neutral ships avoid British territorial waters, it may hasten the end of the war and prevent Britain from scapegoating others, such as sinking ships of third countries and spreading propaganda that it was done by Germany in order to arouse third-country opinion against Germany. Germany believes that it is currently undertaking an unprecedented task, not only for the whole of Europe but also for all neutral countries in the world, to remove the British pirate system.

<h3>German Aircraft Attack Britain Day and Night; Fierce Battles Over London; Anti-Aircraft Guns Roar, German Aircraft Fly Unfazed; Large Bombed Area, But Minor Damage</h3>
<p>London: The London area has felt a great shock today, as over a hundred German aircraft have dropped dozens of bombs in the most intense air raid. Fierce battles are taking place over London, with British Air Force fighters fighting hard to drive away the attackers. The deafening noise of hundreds of anti-aircraft guns shakes the heart and terrifies the soul. Because the anti-aircraft guns are firing continuously, the Nazi planes are forced to soar to great heights, daring not fly low. Ambulances are seen constantly going back and forth throughout the London area. It is reported that two German aircraft have fallen from the sky over London, but it has not been determined whether they were shot down by fighters or by anti-aircraft guns. At the same time, another huge explosion was heard. It is believed that the damage caused by the explosion must be great, as several ambulances have rushed to the scene. The extent of the damage and the number of casualties resulting from this worst air raid on London cannot be detailed in this afternoon's report. A deadly battle is still taking place at a great height. It is reported that German aircraft have been badly hit by British aircraft on the outskirts of London, and many have been shot down. (Associated Press telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Today, multiple groups of German bombers flew over the southeast coast and continued to raid Britain. The London area issued an alert this afternoon. Fierce air battles took place over this area. German aircraft flew very high when flying from the Channel to the inland. Defending British fighters launched a fierce counterattack. The area where the German aircraft dropped bombs was very wide. A British fighter shot down one German aircraft while fighting enemy aircraft over southeast London. Another was hit and faltering. Gunfire from the air was heard throughout London. As far as is currently known, four enemy aircraft have been destroyed in the London area. Although German aircraft continued to raid in the evening, the damage was relatively small. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>London: German aircraft raided Britain again last night, but it is believed that the damage caused was very minor. Early this morning, a team of British fighters shot down a German bomber over the coast of the North Sea. According to a joint statement issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Security, enemy aircraft dropped bombs last night in several areas of Britain and Wales. There was slight damage to houses, and the number of casualties was very small. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon's German war report stated that a German submarine sank enemy cargo ships totaling 32,300 tons. Yesterday, the German Air Force continued its reconnaissance and bombing operations, day and night. German aircraft bombed airfields, anti-aircraft gun positions, and searchlight positions in southern and central England; the Felton motor manufacturing plant; an aircraft factory near Birmingham; the engineering works of the ports of Cowes, Avonmouth, and Bournemouth; and industrial installations in Reading. Mines were also laid in various British ports to obstruct British traffic. British aircraft attacked western and central Germany and Belgian territory last night. Several houses were hit by bombs. Several civilians were killed and injured. Bombs fell on Brussels, resulting in four deaths and 22 injuries. Last night, a German destroyer shot down a British aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns shot down four more British aircraft. One German aircraft is missing. The total enemy aircraft losses for the 16th of this month are more than 89, and it has since been confirmed that the actual number is as many as 92. (Haitong telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>New German Diplomatic Activity: Important Announcement to Be Released</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to a Berlin dispatch, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement last night stating that the German government is scheduled to hold a special meeting for the press on the 18th, at which time an important announcement will be released. The content concerns German diplomatic activities, but it is not related to foreign mediation of the European war or a German invasion of Britain. The release of this statement has caused speculation among the general public. According to foreign observers, the content of the announcement is nothing more than the issue of Spain joining the Axis powers in the war, or Germany's attitude towards the Italo-Greek dispute. (Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Counterattacks; Night Raid on German Industrial Areas; Over a Hundred Bombs Dropped, Dense Smoke Soars; Severe Damage to Factories in Various Locations</h3>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry announced last night that on the night of August 16, central aircraft flew into German territory and carried out large-scale bombing of new targets. Several British bombers attacked the light gas plant in Lunen; the oil refinery in Politz; the Zeiss factory in Jena; the Messerschmitt aircraft factory in Augsburg; and the aircraft hangar north of Weimar. When attacking the Lunen factory, several oil pools were hit and caught fire. The attack lasted for an hour, with over a hundred bombs dropped. Fire broke out in almost every place within 2,000 yards of the factory. Dense smoke rose straight up. It is known that the factory produces 400,000 tons of oil annually. The ground defenses put up a strong resistance, indicating the importance of the factory. The Junkers aircraft assembly plant in Pomberg and the aircraft factory in Frankfurt were also attacked. The railways in the Ruhr area and the airfields in Germany and its occupied territories were also bombed. Three British aircraft did not return. All targets that were bombed were severely damaged. At the Weimar airfield, a Messerschmitt 110 aircraft took off to intercept the British aircraft, but it was shot down by the British aircraft. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>German Invasion Plan: Still a Deep Mystery</p>
<p>The German military camps along the Channel: The German Air Force attacked the British Isles yesterday, flying across the Channel at a high speed of 300 miles per hour, almost without interruption. German officers, acting as hosts, led journalists on a three-day tour to inspect the German-occupied areas across from the white chalk cliffs of Britain. The German military maintains one-way traffic across the English Channel in that location, as the superior German Air Force flows in groups towards Britain, while the British aircraft seeking revenge are as rare as morning stars. The current air war seems to be the first phase of the attack on Britain. The German military may then use long-range artillery to cover its major offensive operations. Although the invasion plan is still a deep mystery, Calais and Boulogne seem to be logical starting points for a large number of German troops to land in Britain. (International News Service telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Another British Submarine Lost</h3>
<p>London: According to official announcements, the submarine "Thistle," formerly attached to the Fourth Submarine Flotilla of the British fleet in China, has not returned after its due date and must be considered lost. The submarine weighs 1,475 tons and is equipped with a four-inch gun. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>German Minorities Outside Romania; Submit Urgent Requests; Request Permission to Form Self-Defense Organizations; Participate in Administration on a Larger Scale</h3>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian territory desired by Hungary, with borders starting from the Mureș River west to Bălgrad (Alba Iulia), including three purely Hungarian provinces, estimates that out of the 5.5 million people in the territories gained by Romania from Hungary after World War I, 3.7 million people will be annexed to Hungary. Of the 102,000 square kilometers of land gained by Romania based on the Treaty of Trianon, 65,000 square kilometers will be ceded to Hungary. The Romanian side claims that if Hungary's demands are accepted, 167,000 Romanians, 136,000 Germans, and 133,000 Jews will be placed under Hungarian rule, while only 200,000 Hungarians will remain in Romanian territory. At the same time, the nearly 900,000 Germans in Romania are gradually calling for returning to their homeland. Yesterday, German leaders visited the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, making urgent demands unfavorable to Romania, advocating for an immediate solution to the issue of their military service and taxation obligations, and requesting permission to organize their own self-defense organizations and participate in administration on a larger scale. The Romanian government will respond to these demands in the middle of next week. (Reuter telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Budapest: Regarding the Hungarian-Romanian negotiations, Hungarian newspapers yesterday only reprinted important news published by foreign newspapers and did not write articles to comment on it.

The Hungarian "Szegedi Napló" pointed out that German newspapers have clearly expressed their wish that the Hungarian-Romanian problem be solved by the two countries themselves, without foreign forces intervening. The "Magyar Nemzet" believes that the Hungarian-Romanian negotiations should be conducted seriously, which is a matter of course, and said that the reaction of the Romanian delegation to Hungary's proposal cannot be disclosed to the outside world. The newspaper continued, saying that the document answering the Romanian government could be delivered to the Romanian delegation on the 19th, which is a reliable fact.

<p>Rome. The Italian High Command announced that in British Somaliland, Italian forces, advancing from Zeila, have captured Burao, near Berbera. Another column has reached near Laferug.

<p>Cairo. It was announced here last night that Italian forces have withdrawn from the Capuzzo fort near the Egyptian-Libyan border. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome. After the Italian war communiqué was released yesterday, well-informed military sources here believe that the British Somaliland campaign has ended in victory. British forces have begun a full-scale retreat, and Italian forces are expected to occupy Berbera within a few days. After the fall of Berbera, all British lines of communication can be cut off, forcing them to surrender or be annihilated. Yesterday, all newspapers here published articles commenting on the political and military consequences of Britain's defeat in Somaliland. The famous journalist Gaeta published an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia" as follows: (1) The entire Italian army and all military equipment can be used for operations elsewhere. (2) The crisis of British attacks has been alleviated, as British forces must now withdraw from Berim-Aden. (3) The threat to Aden will become more acute. (4) Italy will obtain abundant products from Somaliland, strengthening Italy's economic and agricultural resources. (5) Britain's prestige in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean will be further shaken, which may encourage some countries, especially Arab countries on the east and south coasts of the Red Sea and in the Indian Ocean, to resist Britain. Gaeta continued that the Italian forces overcame many difficulties in this operation and achieved a complete victory thanks to the bravery of the officers and soldiers. (Haitong Telegraph, 18th)</p>

<h3>Crowds Demonstrate in Lyon, France, Demanding the Resignation of Mayor Herriot; Hundreds of Municipal Officials to Be Dismissed</h3>
<p>Vichy. A large-scale demonstration took place in Lyon yesterday, demanding the resignation of Édouard Herriot, Speaker of the French Chamber of Deputies and Mayor of Lyon.

<p>Vichy. "Le Petit Parisien" reported yesterday that more than 400 French municipal officials will be dismissed and investigated for dereliction of duty and political reasons. Many of them will have their pensions revoked. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy. After the French Supreme Court was officially established in Riom, the "Journal de Genève" commented, "The mission entrusted to the French Supreme Court is extremely difficult and important. In essence, its sole task is to determine the responsibility that should be borne by those who caused France's misfortune in the past, that is, to investigate the mistakes committed by the authorities, thereby punishing them, and to investigate the truth of France's failure. France's failure and the mistakes of past rulers are undeniable facts." Political figures here are paying close attention to this article, saying that its words are not like the general comments of foreign newspapers, and that it has made the most accurate explanation of the significance of the establishment of the French Supreme Court. After France's sudden military failure, the political system collapsed, and the people of the whole country were greatly indignant, believing that France had been sacrificed by a vast and dark act of betrayal. Therefore, in order to re-establish the political system, it is necessary to thoroughly examine the internal causes of the failure, so that the people can know the root cause of this failure and the current predicament.

The British Air Force also lost 33 bombers in sorties. As of August 14th, German losses identified include 260 bombers and dive bombers, and 137 fighters. Based on this estimate of aircraft types, German pilots must have lost 550 people. The German losses in the major air battles on August 15th and 16th have not yet been fully ascertained.

<h3>British Troops Stationed in Tianjin Withdraw Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tianjin. British troops boarded Jianglun ships at dawn today for Tanggu, where they will transfer to the Taisheng ship for a destination whose location is unknown. When they lined up to go to the Jiangbian (riverside) in the British Concession, the sky was still dim. There were no drums or music. Although officials kept the withdrawal secret, some British and Chinese gathered at the Jiangbian to see them off. Most of those seeing them off were in evening wear. Although the British troops stationed in Tianjin had not been here for long, they had made many friends. Many Japanese photographers rushed to the Jiangbian, trying to take pictures even in the dim light. The British Chamber of Commerce team and the British Concession police force formed a rough honor guard to see them off. A British soldier said that he was reluctant to leave after only a short time in Tianjin, but that going elsewhere to participate in battles was more exciting than staying in Tianjin. British people in China were unhappy about the withdrawal of the British troops, feeling a sense of loss. Although there were not many British troops stationed in Tianjin, they were still a link between the expatriates in a foreign country and their motherland. When the British troops boarded the ship, a sergeant took out an accordion and sang, and those seeing them off and onlookers joined in on the dock. Many people sang sorrowful songs and shed tears. The ship weighed anchor at six o'clock in the morning, and cheers continued until the ship disappeared from sight. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Central Radio Broadcasts Congratulations to President Quezon</h3>
<p>Chongqing. August 18th is the sixty-second birthday of President Quezon of the Republic of the Philippines. It is learned that the Central International Broadcasting Station will hold a special broadcast program at 7:00 PM on the 18th to celebrate. At that time, the station will invite Wu Tiecheng, Minister of Overseas Affairs of the Central Government, to give a speech in English and broadcast it to the Philippines. At the same time, the station will also invite the National Orchestra of the Central Broadcasting Station to play various famous songs, which will be rebroadcast by various radio stations in Manila. There will certainly be a lively situation throughout the Philippines at that time. The friendly relations between China and the Philippines began as early as 1372. Since then, exchanges between the two countries have become increasingly frequent. The people of the two countries have many similarities in some places, and they are closely linked. Since President Quezon took office, with his wise leadership, he has not only made the Philippines increasingly prosperous and happy, but also made many friendly contributions to our diplomatic relations. There are many Chinese compatriots in the Philippines, and the people of the Philippines cooperate sincerely. President Quezon can also look ahead and give them preferential treatment, so that the lives of the people of the two countries can be improved. Since the beginning of our country's war of resistance, President Quezon has given us various righteous sympathies and assistance. It is heard that on the occasion of Quezon's sixty-second birthday, Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang have sent telegrams to Quezon to congratulate him. (Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Fucheng Arrives in Chengdu to Inspect Opium</h3>
<p>Chengdu. Zhu Fucheng, acting director of the Sichuan Opium Inspection Group, arrived in Chengdu by plane from Chongqing on the 18th, carrying the order of Chiang, who also serves as the head of the group. According to him, he was ordered to come to Chengdu to inspect, aiming to gather opinions from all parties, focus on the actual situation, and formulate concrete and implementable measures to be presented to the Chairman for adoption. Zhu then said that many people say that heavy penalties should be used to ban opium. I believe that heavy penalties can indeed be used, but they must be used appropriately. If heavy penalties can be truly enforced against the powerful, they will certainly have the effect of killing one to warn a hundred. As for the reports from various counties, towns, and villages, it is important to mobilize the power of the people to conduct organized door-to-door inspections. My cursory observation will have little effect. (Telegram, 18th)</p>

Unexpectedly, the alarm sounded again at 1:00 AM, and 30 Japanese aircraft were flying towards Chongqing. At that time, the weather turned better and the moonlight was bright. At 2:10 AM, Japanese aircraft flew into Chongqing from the southeast and dropped bombs in major commercial areas.

<h3>French Merchant Charity Lottery Changes Its Articles of Association; Approved and Promulgated by the French Consul; Issued on September 13</h3>
<p>After the French Merchant Refugee Relief Charity Lottery Co., Ltd. submitted its application for changes in the method of operations to the French Municipal Council, the French Consul specially issued Order No. 317 yesterday to inform the citizens and encourage them to promote it. The original order is as follows: Article 1: In accordance with the provisions of January 7, 1927, the French company law for commercial use in China, the French Merchant "Refugee Relief Charity Lottery" Co., Ltd., was organized and registered with the French Consulate General on June 21, 1938, No. 102, and was approved to be established in the French Concession, and to issue a lottery once on September 13, 1940, and to pay the prizes in cash.</p>
<p>Article 2: The sole purpose of the company is to raise funds to assist Chinese charitable causes. Article 3: The price of the lottery ticket is set at 10 yuan per ticket, each ticket is divided into five strips, each strip is 2 yuan. The drawing should be held publicly, by drawing lots according to the number, and held in front of two representatives of the company's board of directors and a supervisor appointed by the French Consul General. The amount of issue, the date of the draw, and the amount of each prize should be noted on each ticket. There are 100,000 tickets for sale, and another 10,000 tickets are for gifts to buyers. The total amount of prizes is 500,000 yuan, which is distributed according to the prescribed distribution method. This distribution method is printed on each ticket. If the number of tickets sold is less than 100,000, the amount of the prize should be reduced proportionally according to the prize distribution method. The company guarantees the prize, and the amount of the prize should be equal to half of the total value of the tickets participating in the draw.</p>
<p>Gift lottery tickets are not included. In any case, the minimum total amount of prizes should not be less than 100,000 yuan, and the first prize should be at least 50,000 yuan for the whole ticket, or 10,000 yuan for a 2 yuan strip. This is calculated on the basis that at least 22,000 lottery tickets (including 2,000 gift tickets) are participating in the draw. If the actual number of tickets sold does not violate the minimum limit, the unsold tickets contained within this 22,000 minimum limit may still participate in the draw to benefit charity. The prize money to be paid, calculated as 100,000 yuan, should be deposited in the Shanghai Banque de l'Indochine before the issuance of lottery tickets as collateral. All prize money not claimed by the winner within six months from the date of the draw should be allocated to charity purposes and distributed in accordance with the provisions of Article 4. Article 4: All net profits after the awarding of prizes, i.e., excluding prizes, miscellaneous expenses, and sales commissions (up to 12.5% of the total actual selling price), shall be disposed of by the company's board of directors. Article 5: Anyone who violates this order shall be punished in accordance with Article 48 of the Police and Road Administration Regulations.</p>
<h3>New Defense Zone Incident: Rumors of Local Resolution; Hearing of Seeking Compromise by Transferring Patrol Rights to the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Washington, 18th (Special Dispatch from the American United Press): Acting U.S. Secretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the dispute over the British military defense zone takeover in the Shanghai International Settlement could be resolved locally. The issue is still under discussion between the Japanese and American authorities stationed in Shanghai and has not yet become a matter for the State Department. Reports that the dispute has been resolved in Shanghai have not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 18th (Reuter's Telegraph): Chinese people here are paying close attention to the developments in Shanghai caused by the withdrawal of British troops. The decision of the U.S. Marines to take over an important part of the British defense area is generally welcomed. The reason why Chinese people are paying attention to the situation in Shanghai is not only because a large number of Chinese people reside in the Public Settlement, but also because they believe that the American decision will largely reflect its future Far Eastern policy. The Chinese people sincerely hope that the current status of the Public or French Concessions will not change.</p>
<p>The general view here is that any decision by the United States to take over the British defense area, or to express a strong attitude, will be equivalent to a closer understanding between Britain and the United States and a more active role for the United States in the Far East. On the other hand, if the United States allows Japan to take over the British defense area, it would be tantamount to the United States voluntarily giving up and avoiding conflict with Japan. At the same time, if Japan agrees to the United States taking over the British defense area, it will mean that Japan is not yet prepared to take radical policies in the Far East, or even to the extent of conflict with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the general public is now discussing the American decision, believing it to be a sign of a stronger American policy in the Far East.</p>
<p>Pending Approval</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that a member of the Shanghai Garrison Command Committee told reporters yesterday (17th) that the committee did not know whether Chairman Vice Admiral Takeda (commander of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force) would convene another meeting. After the committee meeting ended on Thursday, the official Japanese statement hinted that Takeda would convene a resumed meeting of the committee. At the meeting on Thursday, Takeda voted against the resolution, stating that the Japanese side reserved the right to propose ten alternative proposals. Subsequently, the official statement also stated that the resolution would not take effect until approved by the relevant governments.</p>
<p>Compromise Solution</p>
<p>It was rumored yesterday that the Japanese side may seek a compromise solution to this issue with the committee members who voted in favor, and that Takeda may suggest at the next meeting that the patrol rights of the British defense area be handed over to the Public Works Department's Police Department. Police officials told reporters that this suggestion could be implemented, but it is doubtful whether the Japanese side actually made this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Two Assassination Attempts in Western Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Chen Guoliang Seriously Wounded After Being Shot; Liang Changhai on the Verge of Death After Being Hit by Four Bullets</h3>
<p>Two assassination attempts occurred in this city yesterday. The first occurred at 7:45 a.m. when three thugs went to Chen Guoliang's residence on Yuyuan Road. Two people stood guard outside the door, and one went upstairs, broke into Chen's bedroom, and shot at Chen. He was shot in the chest and other places on the spot, and his breath was faint.</p>
<p>The second incident occurred at around 8:00 a.m. at the Lu Xue residence in western Shanghai. The victim was Liang Changhai.

<p>Shot Immediately After Arriving in Shanghai from Fujian</p>
<p>At 7:45 a.m. yesterday morning, a shooting occurred suddenly at No. 9, Lane 419, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai. It has been learned that this number is a Western-style apartment located near the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road. The resident of Room 18 in that number is Chen Guoliang (also known as Gongliang), a Fujianese man, 40 years old, whose wife is German. At 7:30 a.m. yesterday morning, two men, one well-dressed and the other resembling a servant, entered the number and went straight upstairs to Chen's room, knocking tightly on the door, claiming to be visiting Committee Member Chen. At that time, Chen was already awake and got up to open the door. Unexpectedly, this uninvited guest pulled out a gun and fired four shots at Chen in a row. Chen quickly dodged, but one bullet had already hit his chest and left breast, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the gunmen went downstairs and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the apartment immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to call a car and send the injured person to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury is extremely serious and life is in danger, because the bullets did not pass through at the time and remained in the body. It is also said that Chen recently came to Shanghai from Fujian and has only lived in the apartment for two or three days.</p>
<p>Hit by Four Bullets, Severely Wounded</p>
<p>Liang Changhai, a Yangzhou native residing in Mei Xiangtai Leather Store on Robert Sheng Road, is 21 years old and a member of the "China Anti-Communist Alliance." At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he was shot by two unknown people on the bank of the Stinky Water Ditch on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai. He was shot four times on the spot, one shot next to his left breast, one shot in his back, and one shot in each of his left and right arms. He fainted and fell to the ground, unconscious. The gunmen then fled. Later, someone sent him to the Jiren Hospital set up by the Japanese on Jessfield Road. Before long, a certain party moved Liang to another hospital for treatment. Liang was wearing a white suit, shirt, yellow twill shorts, and yellow leather shoes at the time. It is said that the injury is very serious and life cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>In addition, the Public Works Department's rice subsidy for Chinese employees with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan has been set at seven yuan. In addition, in the week ending August 15th, the Public Works Department's Health Department inspected 13 refugee camps, housing 6,482 refugees.</p>
<h3>Dredging Planned for the Intersection of Waterways in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Port Affairs Department announced that dredging of the Huangpu River will begin on the 26th due to silting. It issued a special announcement yesterday ordering all shipping companies to navigate carefully. The original text reads: "It has been found that the Junpu Bureau's dredging vessel Haihu will begin dredging work at the intersection of waterways starting from August 26th of this year, continuing upstream from 3,500 feet downstream of the second floating buoy on the Shanghai shore to the middle of the second and third floating buoys. The work of the dredging vessel will be carried out in narrow waterways. All crew members of ships sailing in the Huangpu River should sail at an extremely slow speed within the possible range when passing the Pudong side of the dredging vessel to maintain safety. Considerable attention should be paid to the narrowness of the navigable waterway and a long blast of the whistle should be sounded when approaching the dredging vessel so that the vessel has sufficient time to loosen the anchor chain at the side of the vessel if necessary. The working signal of the dredging vessel shown in this Department's No. 10 announcement of August 25th, 1932, will still be displayed as usual, and a white signboard illuminated by lights will be hung at both ends of the dredging vessel, indicating the word 'dredging vessel' for easy viewing. In addition, all navigators must not neglect that there are two side anchor chains on the side of the dredging vessel close to the waterway, so ships should not be too close to the dredging vessel. Ships sailing near the dredging vessel should not be overtaken by the ship behind or passed by ships coming from the opposite side. Furthermore, drawings of this dredging project can be obtained from this Department, the Pilot's Association, or the Engineering Department of the Junpu Bureau. All shipping companies are hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Achievements in Maintaining Security During the Period of Special Alert</h3>
<p>The strict alert measures taken by the authorities of the two concessions since the 9th, after safely passing the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War anniversary under strict military and police security and prevention, the special alert was lifted on the night of the 14th, and the ordinary alert is still being continued. According to a report from the Public Works Department's Police Department, the effect of maintaining security was remarkable during the past alert period. Due to the strict security within the concession, the number of criminal cases in the past week has been reduced to 25, the number of theft cases has been reduced to 20, and the number of robbery cases has also been reduced to 17. This shows that the adoption of alert measures has had a significant effect on maintaining security.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Occurs at the Paramount Ballroom; Two Dancers Carried Away</h3>
<p>At around 0:15 a.m. last night, four dancers were at the Paramount Ballroom at the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Yuyuan Road. Zhao Wenbin, resident of No. 42, Lane 613, Xiafei Road, Mr. Wu, resident of Room 609, Jinmen Hotel, Wang Jianchang, and Bian Zheng, were enjoying champagne when four burly men suddenly broke into the hall, showed their guns, and handcuffed Zhao Wenbin and Mr. Wu together and dragged them into a car parked at the door. They sped away and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Guluotou Being Bombed; Foreign Ships Still Plan to Sail to Ao River; A Moufu Ship Has Not Unloaded Cargo and Prepares to Sail Again; Portuguese Consulate Investigates Portuguese Merchants' Property in Songmen</h3>
<p>The German-owned Moufu ship of the Lihe Foreign Company returned to this port on the 17th and docked at the Bund Wharf on the 16th. All passengers disembarked, but the cargo was not unloaded. The decision on whether the ship would sail to the Ao River again was originally expected to be made yesterday, but due to the Sunday holiday, it will need to be decided today. As of yesterday, there was still no news of the Changde ship of the Italian-owned Luo Kezhi Foreign Company returning to Shanghai. According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, there are rumors that Guluotou was bombed by Japanese planes, but the extent of the damage is unknown, which has made foreign ships in this port feel more depressed about resuming voyages to the Zhejiang coast.</p>
<p>Yongtai Returns</p>
<p>The Fangsheng Company's Yongtai ship arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. All passengers disembarked at the Sanjiangkou, but the cargo was completely returned. The ship is currently berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf and will begin unloading cargo today. Other ships that were forced to return from sailing to Zhejiang include the German-owned Hana ship of the Far East Company. The British-owned Xinan Tong ship had loaded cargo and was about to set sail when news of the detention of the Moufu ship caused them to stop. When Japanese troops boarded the German-owned Lihe Foreign Company's Moufu ship and other ships for inspection, they were very indignant. Sometimes the Japanese troops found no contraband after the inspection, but they would not immediately release the ship and sometimes detained it for several days before forcing it to return to its original location, causing huge losses.</p>
<p>Shenhua Aftermath</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the British-owned Yilong Company's Shenhua ship being robbed this time, the Fujianese expatriates in Shanghai are doing their best to handle it. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency learned yesterday that (1) a detailed report on the beginning and end of the Shenhua robbery has been prepared by Zheng Zhixiong, a representative of the expatriates who were robbed, and submitted to the expatriate association yesterday as a reference for handling the aftermath. (2) The rescue committee of the expatriate association for the Shenhua ship robbery is scheduled to send people to the Yilong Company this morning to make oral representations based on the reports and requests of the expatriates who were robbed. (3) There are nearly 100 expatriates from Fujian who were robbed, and they are currently staying temporarily at the Asia Hotel and the Ping'an Inn. Except for a small number who can still take care of their own food and lodging, most of them are already impoverished. After the rescue committee sent people to visit and investigate, the committee has consulted with the authorities of the two hotels and stated that the rescue committee will be responsible for those who cannot take care of their own food and lodging and asked them to provide proper accommodation.</p>
<p>Remaining Goods</p>
<p>(4) Those who wish to ask the association for relief may go to the Sanshan Funing Guild Hall on Yunnan Road, Fuzhou Road, from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day to fill out an application form. After the association verifies that it is true, it will provide relief. (5) As for the remaining goods after the Shenhua ship was robbed, after the Fuzhou Silk and Cloth Public Association and other organizations convened a meeting and discussed it, they began to retrieve the remaining goods on the 16th. However, the various organizations of the association expressed dissatisfaction that the company did not immediately notify the cargo owners to collect the goods after the remaining goods returned to Shanghai, resulting in the theft of the remaining goods after the robbery.</p>
<p>Portuguese Consulate Notice</p>
<p>Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Leibeiro, notified Portuguese nationals and organizations yesterday that those who have property in Songmen, eastern Zhejiang Province, should quickly report to the Consulate General without delay.</p>
<h3>Cheap Rice Sales to Be Held Tomorrow; Recent Sharp Rise in Rice Prices Is Unreasonable; Grain Imports Are Flowing In, Rice Prices Should Fall</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cheap Rice Sales Committee has decided that the fifth phase of cheap broken rice sales will continue to be held starting at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. There are a total of 60 cheap rice sales points in the two concessions, 30 for selling tickets and 30 for distributing rice. It is stipulated that each point will only sell 50 bags per day, for a total of 1,500 bags of cheap broken rice per day. Each person is limited to one yuan, which is equivalent to four 市斤 of rice. All civilians who buy rice must first purchase rice tickets at the nearest ticket sales point and then collect rice at the designated rice distribution point. There should be no rushing or crowding. The purpose of handling cheap rice sales is purely to provide relief to the common people, so all civilians who buy rice must strictly observe order.</p>
<p>Unreasonable Sharp Rise</p>
<p>According to a report from the Public Works Department, the sharp rise in rice prices last month was the main reason for the increase in the index. The price of No. 1 japonica rice reached an unprecedented peak of 74.5 yuan per stone on the 20th. The average selling price of No. 2 japonica rice last month was 60.39 yuan, a sharp increase of 29.48% compared to the previous month. The rice was dried and sold on July 15th, and it rained frequently starting on the night of the 13th. There was heavy rain on the 16th, and there was even more rain between the 23rd and 19th, which eliminated the worry about lack of rain. In addition, the amount of rice in storage has gradually increased, and the supply has been continuous. A large amount of Saigon rice has been ordered, which shows that there is no reason for the rice prices in this city to rise sharply.</p>
<p>Import Statistics</p>
<p>The import of flour and grains in the half year from January to June of this year broke all previous records, and Shanghai and North China had the most. The value of the imported goods was higher than the value of cotton imports. According to statistics, the import of flour and grains in this half year totaled 68 million gold units, accounting for nearly 20% of the total imports. During the same period, cotton imports were more than 53 million units. Grain and flour increased by 17 million gold units compared to September 1939, due to the large import of Vietnamese rice. During this period, the import volume of rice was 337,000 tons, worth approximately 36 million gold units, while in September last year, it was only 220,000 tons, worth approximately 16.5 million gold units. Approximately 197,000 tons of this imported rice came from Vietnam and Siam, which ranked second with 91,000 tons.</p>
<h3>August 27th This Month, Confucius's Birthday Anniversary, Customs Will Be Closed</h3>
<p>August 27th (Tuesday) is the anniversary of the birth of Confucius. The Jianghai Customs will be closed for one day to commemorate it. An announcement has been made to all merchants to be informed.</p>
<h3>Emergency Epidemic Hospital Provides Free Treatment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, sponsored by the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, has its main hospital at No. 730, Wenjianshi Road (i.e., the Qianye Guild Hall) and a branch hospital at No. 474, Haige Road. The chief physician of the main hospital is Dr. Tong Zhiqing, and the chief physician of the branch hospital is Dr. Zhang Chengxue. All other doctors are also caring and compassionate. In addition to emergency epidemics, other internal and external departments are also treated. Since the hospital is set up to provide relief to the poor and sick, the organization of the wards is not divided into grades. The hospital is equipped with more than 200 beds, which are specially used for inpatients with epidemic and gastrointestinal diseases. All are treated equally. However, ordinary internal and surgical patients are limited to outpatient treatment to avoid the spread of epidemics. It is stipulated that no fees will be charged for outpatient or inpatient treatment, and all registration fees, consultation fees, etc., will be waived. All medicines used are also supplied by the hospital, even the most expensive medicines. For example, dysentery patients should be injected with dysentery serum. Although the current market price of this type of medicine is extremely high, no fees will be charged. This is a unique example of the hospital, which is different from general hospitals. The hospital's funding comes from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association. On the one hand, the Chinese Red Cross Society assists with equipment and utensils. The current period of opening is scheduled to end at the end of September of this year. However, at that time, it will be decided whether to extend it depending on the situation. The hospital's benefits to the poor and sick will have a significant impact on the general public's health problems.</p>
<h3>International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation's Business Report</h3>
<p>The International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation of New York, the parent company of the Shanghai Telephone Company, in view of the current special situation, reports on the company's situation in various countries every three months. The report for the end of March 1940 has now been issued, with a net surplus of US$406,500. However, the International Standard Electric Company and the Telephone Company in Virginia were not included in the report due to the war. According to news, the various branches of the International Standard Electric Company established in Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway have not suffered losses due to the war, but the scope of work has been slightly reduced. The company in France notified the French government to move important parts to other places before the evacuation of Paris. As for the company's property in Romania, the Russian-occupied part accounts for only one-tenth of the company's total assets.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inform Western Shanghai Residents to Stop Paying Rent to Landlords; Claiming That After the Withdrawal of the British Defense Forces, the Rent Will Be Paid to the Japanese Organization</h3>
<p>The Yulin West News reports that yesterday (17th), according to reliable sources, several Japanese and Chinese people went to the Yuyuan Road and Bailinan Road areas in western Shanghai and instructed the residents of each household not to pay the rent to the current landlords anymore, but to wait until the British troops leave Shanghai soon and the area is incorporated into the Japanese military defense zone. The rent will be paid to an organization newly established by the Japanese to take over the real estate.</p>
<p>Earlier, on Thursday last week, the day when the Shanghai Garrison Command Committee held a meeting, a group of Japanese and Chinese people went to the Yuyuan Road area and instructed Chinese and foreign residents to pay the rent to the Japanese organization in the future. A certain foreigner asked them who they were. One of them replied that they represented a certain "official organization," but they did not show any documents proving their identity. It is said that yesterday (17th), another group of Japanese and Chinese people went to the Bailinan Road area on motorized bicycles and instructed the residents not to pay the rent until the area was taken over by the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>Daylight Kidnapping in Zhoujin Lane; Police Detectives Surround and Fight; Children Lure to Open the Door, Gangsters Kidnap; Victim Robbed and Shot, Bullet Hits Right Armpit; Detectives Knock Down Two Thieves and Capture One Alive</h3>
<p>At around 11:15 a.m. yesterday morning, a kidnapping attempt suddenly occurred at No. 9, Jingfu Lane, Zhoujin Lane, 389 Shanxi Road (i.e., the entrance to Zhoujin Lane, Hankou Road). The victim was Chen Yanlin. The kidnappers shot him in the back. The gangsters resisted arrest. The two sides exchanged gunfire more than ten times. As a result, three gangsters were captured on the spot. The details of the incident are learned as follows:</p>
<p>Handcuffed and Dragged</p>
<p>Chen Yanlin, 33 years old, from Nanjing, runs the Yecheng Industrial Society at No. 9, Jingfu Lane, Shanxi Road (i.e., the entrance to Zhoujin Lane, Hankou Road), selling Daxih toothpaste. His business is doing fairly well. His family lives upstairs. At around 11:15 a.m. yesterday morning, Chen was wearing a white silk shirt and trousers and was sitting in the manager's office in the west wing, handling business. Suddenly, a child of ten years old knocked on the door and entered, exchanging Daxih toothpaste coupons. Unexpectedly, six gangsters followed behind and rushed into the west wing, with one person standing guard outside the door. Three of them showed box cannons and threatened Chen, prohibiting him from making any noise. They took out handcuffs, handcuffed Chen's hands, and dragged him out, attempting to take him to a car parked at the entrance of the lane and kidnap him.</p>
<p>Victim Shot</p>
<p>At this time, Chen refused to give in and resisted the gangsters with all his strength. However, he was outnumbered and was eventually dragged out of the lane. A Chinese policeman happened to be passing by and saw several people in Western suits dragging a person away. He knew they were not good people, so he pulled out his service pistol and fired a shot into the sky. The gangsters saw that the police had arrived and that the matter had been exposed. One of them fired a box cannon at Chen, hitting his right back, penetrating the front armpit, and leaving the bullet in his right arm. His lungs were slightly injured. After Chen was shot, he fell to the ground with a thud, and fresh blood gurgled out. At this time, nearby Chinese policemen gathered after hearing the alarm, and a Western policeman also patrolled by. The Central Police Station also heard the news and drove a police car to surround and arrest them.</p>
<p>A Fight</p>
<p>The gangsters fled Jingfu Lane, turned south and went west on Fuzhou Road. The detectives chased closely. The gangsters opened fire to resist arrest, hoping to escape. The sound of gunfire crackled along the way, and bullets were like beads. The two sides fired more than ten shots. One gangster escaped to the Gaochangxing Hotel on the Four Horses Road, passed through the back door, and went to the Wu Gong Hotel Lane, where he was caught by a gatekeeper. Another gangster, named Zhang Guilin, was shot in the leg and fell to the ground, where he was arrested. He was taken to the police hospital for treatment. Another gangster, dressed in a white shirt and trousers, a Palis Western suit, and black leather shoes, was shot in the right shoulder, and blood dripped down. He attempted to escape by streetcar but was intercepted by the police and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he refused to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Three Gangsters Captured</p>
<p>In this battle, three gangsters were arrested on the spot, and the rest escaped without a trace. The three arrested gangsters confessed that they had no way to make a living and resorted to this tactic. However, one of the gangsters was very fierce and remained silent when the police chief interrogated him. It is learned that there were six gangsters in total, only one of whom was wearing a white shirt and trousers, and the rest were wearing Western suits. Chen Yanlin, the injured victim, was taken to Tongren Hospital by ambulance for treatment. According to the doctor, Chen's injuries were not minor.</p>
<h3>Partner in Miscellaneous Grain Store Embezzles Huge Sums; Accomplices Arrested Together</h3>
<p>Cai Bingshun, a Chaozhou native, was a partner in the Wenmao Miscellaneous Grain Store at No. 52, Zhoushan Road, in the French Concession. After collecting payments from various customers on July 18th, he did not return to the store and instead opened a hotel with rascals Li Agen (35 years old, Chaozhou native), Xie Meicun (25 years old, Chaozhou native), Jiang Gengsheng (30 years old, Nanjing native), Ye Rongbao (26 years old, Chaozhou native), and Li Meiyong (30 years old, local). After that, he fled back to his hometown of Chaozhou. On the 19th, Li Wenjin, the manager of the store, discovered this and reported to the police station for wanted notices. He also sent his younger brother Li Sicong to Chaozhou to arrest Cai. Only then did he learn that Li and others had divided the money together. Therefore, he reported to the detectives to arrest Li and others separately and send them to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Second Court. The police station's lawyer requested an extension of the investigation period. After questioning by Judge Liao, he ruled that the hearing would be rescheduled to the 31st. All defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Tram Ticket Touts Repeatedly Neglect Duties, Regarding Human Life as a Child's Game; Anxious to Ring the Bell, Another Life Crushed Yesterday; This Widespread Bad Habit Urgently Needs Correction</h3>
<p>Within the past three weeks, tram ticket touts in the British and French Concessions, without waiting for passengers to finish boarding or alighting, prematurely ring the bell and start the tram, then close the tram doors, resulting in the last passengers being dragged, knocked down, and crushed to death. This has already been reported in the newspapers twice, and the police authorities have arrested the touts responsible and sent them to court for prosecution, with one already convicted. However, tram ticket touts in general remain indifferent, leading to another similar tragedy yesterday morning involving a British-owned Route 17 trolleybus. While passing the southern end of Min T'i Ni Yinn Road, near the Sino-French School in the French Concession, a 53-year-old woman named Dai Li, a native of Nanjing, who worked as a domestic helper at No. 3 Taixin Lane, Xinkaihe, attempted to board Route 17 trolleybus B-328 at 9:40 am at the Ningbo Road intersection south of the Min T'i Ni Yinn Road Sino-French School, intending to go to Dapu Bridge. Unfortunately, as Dai was the last to board, with one foot just stepping onto the third-class car's footboard, the ticket tout, without waiting for her to fully board and close the door, rang the bell and started the tram. This caused Dai to lose her balance and fall outwards, her right foot landing under the tram wheel, which then crushed her leg, causing blood and flesh to splatter everywhere, rendering her unconscious. Arresting officers arrived, recorded the tram number, and sent the injured woman to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also reported the incident to the police station. However, Dai succumbed to her injuries and died at 11:20 am. The police station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy, and a summons was issued for family members to identify the body, with the court to send personnel today for inspection and handling.</p>

<h3>Construction Industry Tycoon Faces Two Lawsuits, Both Now Under Trial; Factory Owner's Grandson Sues for Embezzlement of Dividends; Former Concubine's Children Seek Living Expenses</h3>
<p>He Shaoting, a native of Fenghua and manager of the Xinrenji Construction Company, is a tycoon in the construction industry. Recently, he has been implicated in two lawsuits. One is in the First Special District Court, where Shi Qifu, grandson of the factory's founder, Shi Renxiao, is suing him for embezzlement of dividends. The preliminary hearing resulted in the court instructing the plaintiff to first file a lawsuit in the civil court to confirm ownership. The other case is in the Second Special District Court, where his former concubine, acting as the legal representative for her children, is seeking 50,000 national currency for each child's living and educational expenses, totaling 150,000. Details of each case are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Embezzlement of Dividends</p>
<p>The Xinrenji Construction Company, a well-known construction firm in Shanghai located in Room 201, Kenye Building, Beijing Road, and its manager, He Shaoting, along with the head accountant, He Shaoyu, both brothers and natives of Fenghua, Zhejiang, have recently been sued for joint embezzlement by Shi Qifu, a native of Ningbo, Yin County, and owner of Jianhua Radio at No. 36 Duofuli, Foch Road, who has retained lawyer Sun Shian in the First Special District Court's criminal division. The main points of the lawsuit are as follows: The plaintiff's ancestor, Duke Renxiao, operated the Shirenji Construction Company (around the middle of the Guangxu era). In his old age (Guangxu 32nd year), he changed the brand name to Xinrenji and entrusted all affairs to the two defendants, stipulating that if there were profits, they would be divided into twelve dividend shares. Duke Renxiao kept two and a half shares for himself, with the rest to be distributed among the defendants and partners. After Renxiao's death, the plaintiff's mother lived in the countryside, and the plaintiff was young and did not inquire about the factory's affairs. However, living expenses were received annually from Shanghai by the plaintiff's mother. In recent years, the defendants reported that the factory was losing money and did not pay any dividends. Last year, before the plaintiff's mother passed away, she instructed the plaintiff to investigate the accounts of Xinrenji. To exercise his rights as an owner, the plaintiff hired lawyer Sun Shian to send a letter requesting an accounting. However, the defendants replied that Xinrenji had nothing to do with the Shi family and refused to allow an audit. Their ungrateful actions were solely based on the assumption that the plaintiff had no means to prove their claims. However, evidence has been obtained regarding how the defendants altered the Xinrenji account books, reducing the two and a half dividend shares Duke Renxiao had set aside for himself to one share, and then further reducing it to half a share. These various illegal acts cannot be erased by a single denial. Based on the above facts, the defendants have committed the crime of embezzlement under Article 335 of the Criminal Law and should be punished accordingly. Judge Zhan Liangce held a hearing some days ago. Because the parties had a dispute over ownership, it was decided that the case should be judged according to civil law. Therefore, the trial was suspended, and the plaintiff was instructed to first file a lawsuit in the civil court, and the trial will resume after the ownership is determined. Shi Qifu has now complied with the instruction and filed a lawsuit in the civil court to confirm ownership.</p>
<p>Lawsuit Seeking Living Expenses</p>
<p>He Shaoting, a native of Fenghua, is 66 years old and resides at No. 84 Pushi Road. He is a tycoon in the construction industry, possessing enormous wealth, and has many wives and concubines in his household. This spring, He was accused of raping Huang Meixian (a native of Shaoxing, 21 years old, residing at No. 29 Ci Hou North Lane, Avenue Haig), a maid serving his seventh concubine. Huang filed a private prosecution against He in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court for violating public morals. Later, He sought reconciliation, and the woman withdrew the lawsuit, bringing the matter to a close. Recently, He has again been sued by his former concubine, Fu Jindi (30 years old, a native of Anhui, residing at No. 99 Xiang Kang Lane, Avenue Petain), acting as the legal representative for her children, He Zenghui (8 years old), He Zengqiang (4 years old), and Baobao (3 years old). She has hired lawyers Zhu Dianqing and others to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the Second Special District Court, seeking 50,000 national currency for each child's living and educational expenses, totaling 150,000. The court has accepted the case, and Judge Ma Yishu is presiding over the seventh civil division hearing. According to the plaintiff's representative, the defendant previously did not acknowledge the plaintiffs as his children, and the case had been concluded after three trials, confirming their identities. The plaintiffs and their mother previously cohabited with the defendant as a family. However, due to the defendant's numerous wives and concubines,</p>
<p>mutual infighting occurred.</p>
<p>The mother separated from the defendant two years ago, with the defendant paying the mother 50,000 yuan for her personal living expenses. Currently, due to the rising cost of living and high housing expenses, coupled with the extraordinary times and the collapse of savings, their livelihood has become precarious, making it necessary to request funds for living and educational expenses. It is believed that the plaintiffs, as direct descendants of the defendant, should be treated equally with the defendant's other children. It is found that the defendant has not only distributed his property separately but has also given real estate (all the houses and foundations in Longxing Lane, East Pushi Road) and approximately 200,000 yuan in cash to his adopted son, He Caixiong. The plaintiffs are, after all, the defendant's own children. Considering the defendant's estimated wealth of over ten million yuan and the amount of property given to his adopted son, it cannot be considered excessive for the plaintiffs to each request 50,000 yuan for living and educational expenses. The court is requested to order the defendant to pay. The defendant has hired lawyers Wu Linkun and others to appear in court and argue that the defendant separated from Fu on December 25, 1937, as evidenced by a written agreement. Therefore, Fu's status as a legal representative is questionable. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' request for 50,000 yuan per person for living expenses is excessive and should be detailed with a list of uses. The defendant is willing to provide a reasonable amount. However, if the defendant is required to pay a lump sum, it should be deposited in a bank, and the plaintiffs can only use the interest, not the principal. The court, believing that a settlement is possible, adjourned the hearing to the 19th for further deliberation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyuan Lane Bloodshed Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>At around 9 pm the night before last, a man about thirty years old was shot and killed near Jiangyuan Lane on Xinwen Road. The identity of the deceased is still unknown, so the police are continuing their investigation. However, it is reported that only a small wooden plaque with the words "Jin Cui Xiang" was found on the deceased, the meaning of which is unknown.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Du Guoxun, an elderly man from Nanjing in his sixties, residing at No. 25 Meishou Lane, Haig Road, hosted a luncheon for guests at his home yesterday. Due to excessive drinking, he became heavily intoxicated. Shortly thereafter, he attempted to go upstairs to rest but lost his footing in the middle of the staircase, falling and injuring his head and face, and suffering a concussion. His family accompanied him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Chen Guizi, the sixteen-year-old eldest son of Wu Changnian, a native of Jiangbei residing at No. 31 Wufugong, Tianhougong Bridge, North Henan Road, took his younger brother to the Bund's No. 14 pier for a swim. Unfortunately, Chen Guizi did not know how to swim and drowned in the Huangpu River. The body soon floated to the surface and was retrieved by boatmen, who summoned nearby police to transport it to Tongren Hospital, then to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>New Typhoon Development; Possible Threat to Shanghai; High Tide and Rapid Rise in Yangtze River Water Level Since Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Two newly formed typhoons in the Pacific Ocean have been moving slowly and stagnating since their formation. According to a Reuters reporter who inquired at the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday (the 18th), the observatory received a report at 2 pm that the typhoon had reached 17 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, heading northwest. If the direction remains unchanged, Shanghai may be threatened. The observatory and the Jianghai Customs are closely monitoring its development. High tides in the Huangpu River began to occur yesterday morning and are expected to continue for more than eleven feet until the 24th. Since typhoons are constantly forming in the Pacific Ocean, great importance is attached to this. In addition, the water level outside Wusongkou is rapidly rising due to the surge of the Yangtze River, and the tides in the Huangpu River are also significantly affected.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item on page 10 of the third section of your August 18th issue, in the "Local News" column, concerning the distribution of disaster relief funds by the Shaoxing Disaster Relief Committee, it is inconsistent with the facts. The Shaoxing disaster relief funds raised by our association, including the remaining 12,300 yuan from the Carlton Yue Opera charity performance on August 1st and 2nd, amount to approximately 300,000 yuan. The meeting to discuss the distribution method was held on the 16th at the China One Trust Company, chaired by Mr. Xu Xiajun. It was decided that Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, which were the most severely affected by the disaster, would receive 50% of the total amount, with Zhuji, Shengxian, Xinchang, Yuyao, and Shangyu each receiving 10%. The funds will be disbursed after consulting with the relevant trade associations and donors who were not present at the meeting. Therefore, the discussion at the time was about the distribution method of the Shaoxing disaster relief funds. As for the Shaoxing and Xiaoshan relief funds raised by the Shaoxing Disaster Relief Association and the proceeds from the Carlton Peking Opera charity ticket sales held by the association on August 3rd and 4th, totaling approximately 300,000 yuan, they were not included in the discussion. Regarding the news item, a special letter is hereby sent for correction.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Recently Announces the Method for Annual Salary Increase for Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education recently announced the method for annual salary increase for elementary school teachers as follows: (Article 1) This method is formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Regulations on the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers. (Article 2) The municipal and county education administrative organs should make the following regulations based on local financial resources: (1) Every two years, three years, four years, or five years shall be considered an annual grade. (2) Two yuan, three yuan, four yuan, or five yuan in national currency shall be the salary increase for each annual grade. (Article 3) Elementary school teachers who have continuously served in a school for each full annual grade and whose performance is still acceptable shall be promoted to a higher grade and receive a salary increase. (Article 4) Elementary school teachers who have not continuously served in a school should have their annual grade period extended by one year compared to those who have continuously served in a school (for example, those who have continuously served in a school can have one grade every three years, while those who have not continuously served in a school will have one grade every four years). The annual grade period for those whose service period is interrupted should be calculated based on the years after continuous service and should not be combined before and after. However, those who have been transferred by the education administrative organ or interrupted due to illness and have not held other paid positions will still be calculated as continuous service in a school. (Article 5) Elementary school teachers who have received disciplinary actions such as reprimands or demerits during a certain annual grade period should have their salary increase for that grade suspended, but it can be restored if they receive an award during the same period. (Article 6) Annual salary increases and grade promotions and salary payments stipulated in the Regulations on the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers due to qualifications, positions, and the number of students taught shall be carried out simultaneously. (Article 7) Funds for annual salary increases should be specially budgeted by the municipal and county governments and paid monthly together with salaries. When municipal and county funds are insufficient, they may request subsidies from the provincial government. (Article 8) Elementary school teachers who have not been registered and approved shall not be paid with an annual salary, but the annual salary increase they should have received during the registration period may be supplemented after registration and approval. (Article 9) The municipal and county education administrative organs should formulate detailed rules for the implementation of annual salary increases for elementary school teachers in their respective cities and counties in accordance with the provisions of this method and submit them to the provincial and municipal governments for approval and transfer to the Ministry of Education for record. (Article 10) Qualified teachers in national schools, central schools, and people's education departments are subject to the provisions of this method. (Article 11) This method shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Robb Cup International Tennis; China Gains Finals Spot; Defeats England 3-0 Yesterday; Lin Baohua and Liang Baokui Partner Up</h3>
<p>The Robb Cup International Tennis Doubles semi-final between China and England was held yesterday evening at the Shanghai French Club courts on Avenue Joffre. The Chinese team was originally scheduled to be a partnership of Lin Baohua and Wang Wenzheng, but Wang's ankle was injured by his shoe. On doctor's advice, he needed a period of rest, so not only was he unable to represent China in the Robb Cup, he was also unable to play at all. Therefore, the Chinese team yesterday consisted of Lin Baohua and his brother-in-law Liang Baokui. Lin and Liang had cooperated many times in Tianjin previously, dominating the Tianjin area. Last year in Shanghai, Lin and Liang also teamed up to participate in the grass doubles and represented China in the Robb Cup. This year, both players' skills have been improving steadily, so even though England sent the two veterans Bonavee and Stock into battle, they were no match for the Chinese team. As a result, the Chinese team easily defeated England 3-0. The first and second sets were one-sided. Although the third set was tense, the situation was always controlled by Lin and Liang. The Chinese team has won the right to play in the final and will compete with the winner of the USA-Japan match for the championship.</p>
<h3>United Cup Basketball Match Yesterday; Shanghai Qing Defeats Liangxi; First Division Championship Questionable; Paramount Loses to Shanghai Bank</h3>
<p>The United Cup Charity Basketball Match yesterday produced an unprecedentedly tense situation. In the second division, Paramount played against Shanghai Bank. Ye Zuyao and Zhuang Kunpeng of Shanghai Bank were very active, attacking from left and right. Paramount's sharp shooter Lu Dazhen was trapped. Both sides adopted a slow-attack strategy. At the end of the first half, Shanghai Bank led 14-8. In the second half, Paramount's momentum improved slightly, but unfortunately Lu Dazhen missed many shots. Later, Lu was ejected for fouls, and the game turned worse. On Shanghai Bank's side, Zhuang Kunpeng was also ejected for fouls. So Shanghai Bank won 32-19. After Paramount's defeat yesterday, the first division championship has become questionable and must be decided again next week. If Paramount wins against Moore, then Paramount will compete with Shanghai Bank for the championship again. If Moore wins, then Moore and Shanghai Bank will compete for the championship. If Nanyang can defeat Tongren, then Nanyang can also join the championship battle, forming a three-way contest. In the first division, Shanghai Qing played against Liangxi. Shanghai Qing was humiliated in the first round. Yesterday, they made a do-or-die effort. At the end of the first half, Shanghai Qing led 24-15. The final score was 48-54, Shanghai Qing avenged their previous defeat. Before the game, in the women's volleyball performance, Shanghai Star won ten points. Blue Star then retaliated with 21-13, resulting in a draw in the end, which was very exciting. The results of yesterday's games are as follows:</p>

<h3>Charity Billiards Concludes; Friendship Wins Championship; Two-on-One Replay Beats Samsung; Performance Song Federation Overwhelms Wenbin</h3>
<p>The Wenbin Cup charity billiards, after the Friendship and Samsung final last week resulted in a draw, was held again yesterday, with a full audience and an unprecedented spectacle. The two performances before the match were both wonderful. In the Wenbin vs. Song Federation match, the Song Federation won 3-1. The main match was the Friendship vs. Samsung match. Cao Qiuting was unable to play due to a foot injury. Referee Shen Huichun also had the same injury as Qiuting, so the billiards veteran Jia Jiliang was temporarily pulled in to officiate. After the start of the match, Friendship had a strong momentum. Zhang Mingsheng hit two targets, giving them an absolute advantage of 2-0 in the first half. In the second half, Samsung fought back hard and Wu Shaotai scored a goal, ending the game with a 2-1 score. Friendship won the championship. After the game, Xia Wenbin, the donor of the awards, personally presented the awards. Friendship won the Wenbin Cup, and Samsung won the second place cup donated by Shen Xianglin. A grand event has been successfully completed. The ticket income has not yet been tallied and is estimated to be no less than nearly 2,000 yuan, which will greatly benefit the orphans.

<h3>Under What Circumstances Will the Far East and European Situations Begin to Connect? Under What Circumstances Will They Act Individually? Predicting the Future Based on the Current Situation, Is Connection More Likely or Individual Action More Likely? (Continued)</h3>
<p>Yinshan: Whether the war situations in the Far East and Europe can be merged into a single, mixed path, we believe, will be determined by whether or not Japan and the United States become embroiled in the vortex of the Eurasian war. If Japan abandons its repeatedly proclaimed "non-intervention" policy and brazenly implements its southern advance, or if the United States boldly enters the war and engages in combat in the Pacific or Atlantic, then these two battlefronts in Eurasia will undoubtedly quickly connect and intertwine into an even larger situation.</p>
<p>However, based on the current situation, we consistently believe that the possibility of such a connection is very small. Regarding this, whether observed from the United States' unanimous "non-intervention" calls from both the government and the public, or from the repeated statements of the recently re-established Konoe Cabinet in Japan, many facts already indicate the future trend.</p>
<p>Pei Xinghui: The intricacies of international affairs can all be said to have connecting effects. If one must divide them, it can only be done based on time and space, and the size of the impact.</p>
<p>Under what circumstances will the Far East and European situations begin to connect? In other words, under what circumstances will these two battle situations merge into one? Currently, Japan is loudly advocating an alliance with Germany and Italy, while also pressing Vietnam to serve as its military and economic base for its invasion of China and its southern advance. France, having just suffered injuries, may be especially responsive to Japan's demands. Japan's success in its southern advance will certainly exclude England and America from Southeast Asia, and conflicts will naturally arise from conflicting interests. In this situation, it is clear that one side is Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the other side is China, England, and America. At this time, the impact will not only merge the two battle situations into one, but the scope of the impact will likely be even greater.</p>
<p>Now let's discuss the second question: under what circumstances will individual action occur? It seems like the current situation. Germany and Italy, to be honest, have also seen through Japan. Therefore, they are not very interested in an alliance with Japan. England's attitude towards Japan, although seemingly tough in the recent arrest of expatriates, is most difficult to grasp due to the gentlemanly attitude. Under the policies of appeasement and compromise, they may concede a little to Japan and devote all their efforts to Germany. Although the embargo bill in the United States seems fierce, it will not be launched as long as Japan does not completely exclude the United States from Asia. In this way, the situation in the Far East remains the same as it is now, then the two battle situations will certainly continue to act individually.</p>
<p>Finally, let's speculate on which of these two possibilities is greater? It can be said that the latter is more likely. Reasons: (1) Germany and Italy will not help Japan's launch in Asia until they find it difficult to attack England, which means that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan has not yet reached the time. (2) England must devote all its efforts to prevent Germany's invasion when its homeland is in danger, so if Japan does not press too hard, England will make concessions in the Far East. (3) As long as Japan does not completely exclude its interests from Asia, the United States will not act rashly (in fact, Japan is also very concerned about the United States). At the same time, President Roosevelt will of course be very cautious about everything before the election.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be mentioned that China's resistance against Japan has always been linked to any event in the world, and the victory of the resistance can only be determined by ourselves.</p>
<p>Junping: Whether the Far East and European situations are connected or not depends on Japan's policy. If Japan unites with Germany and Italy to resist England and the United States, destroying the power of England and the United States in the Far East, and uses its navy to assist Germany and Italy, then a connection will occur. If Japan only wants to take advantage of the opportunity for its own benefit, and pretends to ally with Italy and Germany, then a connection seems impossible. Judging from the current situation, Japan will inevitably take the second path. Therefore, the possibility of connection is small and the possibility of individual action is large.</p>
<p>Bailun: The reasons and purposes of the wars in the Far East and European situations are different, so they cannot be confused. Unless the aggressor in the Far East changes its foreign policy and, like Germany and Italy, is in a position to attack England, a connection between the Far East and European situations may occur. If Japan continues to follow its consistent policy of maintaining a neutral and wait-and-see position in dangerous situations, then the Far East is one thing, and the European situation is another, each unrelated.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, the possibility of a connection between the Far East and European situations in the future is very small. First, although Japan has replaced the Konoe Cabinet again, it will not attack England by force before the war against China is over. At the same time, to insist on the war against China, it will certainly not overly ignore American public opinion. Second, when England is about to expand its war against Germany, England will not fully assist China economically or militarily in order to preserve its own strength and take a hostile policy against Japan in the Far East.</p>
<p>Answer Group Four</p>
<p>Laosheng: Under the following circumstances, it seems that the Far East and European situations will cause a connection: (1) Japan joins the Axis powers to fight against England. Judging from the current situation, the so-called joining the Axis is only a threat to England. Japan has no strength to participate in the European war, and Germany is also very cold towards it; and Germany's power has already developed, and it will not allow Japan to monopolize the interests of the Far East. (2) The war between England and Germany and Italy reaches a decisive stage. The current stage of the European war has reached a stalemate; the English navy is strong, and it is not easy for Germany and Italy to attack England, and it is also difficult for England to counterattack. Under the following circumstances, it seems that individual action will be caused: (1) China's own strength is becoming stronger and stronger. (2) The anti-aggression front in the Far East is strengthened by unity. The Soviet Union's aid to China is the most active. The American embargo on oil and iron has already been seen to be effective. Japan's plan to invade Vietnam and attack China is also not welcomed by Germany and Italy; both China and France will resist. Predicting the future based on the current situation, relatively speaking: the possibility of individual action is greater than the possibility of connection. Recently, Japan has been singing loudly about the so-called "Asian Monroe Doctrine" and "East Asian New Order," and its intention is also to eliminate the connection effect; this is a phenomenon of Japan hesitating on the diplomatic fork in the road. However, in this era of complex international situations, no matter how the situation changes, there is no absolute individual action; and due to the differences in regions and nationalities, there is no absolute connection effect; what is the impact of the connection and individual action? It is also impossible to make an absolute explanation.</p>
<p>Muxiu: There are several possible situations regarding the connection between the Far East and European situations: (1) Japan joins the Axis, actively advances south, seizes Hong Kong, and invades Annam and the South Seas Islands; as a result, England and Japan declare war. (2) The United States abandons its firm position in the Far East; England succumbs to Japan; relations between China and England and England and the Soviet Union deteriorate; Asia and Europe become a continental group and declare war on England and Japan. (3) Friction and rupture begin between Germany and the Soviet Union: Japan launches a pincer attack on the Soviet Union in the Far East. Conversely, under the following circumstances, individual action will be retained: (1) Japan does not actively advance south; (2) China, England, and the Soviet Union still maintain friendly relations; the Soviet Union still maintains neutrality. Predicting the future based on the current situation, the possibility of connection is quite large, and it is especially in the first situation. Japan is conspiring to take advantage of the situation to rob and seize British, French, and Dutch territories. Its military believes that Germany will be able to endure the war for a long time and win; it expresses doubt about whether the United States can take an active attitude in the Far East; therefore, it often probes the United States recently. As for the possibility of the first connection, it seems small; we do not believe that the English will finally "sell friends for glory," because this move cannot stop the Japanese's ambition to advance south, and it is really stupid; this concession to Japan is obviously a delaying tactic. In addition, the relations between England and the Soviet Union are now being considered for improvement by England, and there is no sign of deterioration. As for the third situation, there is no clue yet.</p>
<p>Chen Longzhang: The Far East and European situations will begin to connect when England and the United States and Japan engage in war behavior, and will act individually when England and the United States abandon all interests in the Far East. Predicting the future based on the current situation: (1) The United States will gradually strengthen its policy towards Japan, but still on the premise of not directly conflicting with Japan. (2) Germany will launch a large-scale attack on England. When Japan is unable to obtain military supplies from the United States, it will directly seize Hong Kong, occupy Vietnam, and try to seize the Dutch East Indies when England is in crisis but has not yet collapsed. Hong Kong will be abandoned without resistance, but the state of hostility between the British and Japanese navies will exist immediately. Occupying Vietnam cannot be achieved by the navy, but it also requires the stationing of 100,000 to 200,000 troops. The Dutch East Indies is rich in resources, and seizing the Dutch East Indies can eliminate the threat of the United States cutting off supplies. From this, it can be concluded that when Japan seizes the Dutch East Indies, it will be the beginning of the occurrence of war behavior between Japan and the United States, and it will also be the starting point of the connection between the European and Far Eastern situations.</p>
<p>Feng Fangzhuo: If Japan participates in the Axis war, the Eurasian war will become one. The battle situations that previously developed separately will become an unprecedented world war. Under what circumstances will Japan participate in the war? (1) England's policy of compromise shows the relaxation of the defense of Southeast Asia. (2) The United States implements the Monroe Doctrine to protect itself in the Western Hemisphere. (3) Soviet-Japanese relations have indeed been improved. However, in addition to filtering out the first point, the second and third points are still questionable. In addition, (1) it is impossible to end the China Incident (2) the economic exhaustion of the Japanese group. (3) The domestic people's hearts are shaken. The political situation is unstable, although Konoe has ascended the stage to reform the system, it is still ineffective, making Japan have the suffering of not being able to participate in the war, and having to adopt a waiting and gradual policy. Therefore, from the current point of view, the Eurasian situation is still more likely to develop on its own.</p>
<h3>Under the Connected Situation, What Kind of Changes May Occur in the Economic World? Under the Individual Situation, What Kind of Situation Will the Economic World Form? Under These Different Situations, How Can China's Economic World Adapt to the Environment?</h3>
<p>Feng Fangzhuo: If Japan participates in the war on the side of Germany and Italy, the world situation will change drastically. Not only will China and England stand on the same front (specifically against Japan), but England and the United States will also cooperate further. At that time (1) the economic blockade against Japan will be carried out under the joint posture of England and the United States. (2) Due to the increase in British and American aid to China, China's economic status will become more consolidated. (3) Japan will seize all concessions and leased territories along the coast of China and completely destroy the economic power of foreigners in China. Conversely, if Japan does not participate in the war, the Far Eastern situation will not change drastically. Then Japan will definitely (1) strictly implement an economic blockade against China, (2) more strictly implement economic control and exploitation in the occupied areas, (3) reduce the economic activities of foreigners and Chinese in the occupied areas and coastal ports to zero, (4) the economy of Free China will establish a truly national capital foundation in the environment of self-sufficiency and the people's hard struggle. Therefore, no matter how the international situation changes, China's economic world should thoroughly recognize its only way out: only by moving funds to the interior as much as possible and investing in various emerging industries can it avoid the path of collapse and death.</p>
<p>Jiang Zhicheng: If the connected situation refers to the confrontation between the Germany-Italy-Japan axis and England and the United States, then the situation will be the same as the economic world under the individual situation. If the connected situation develops into a war in which England, the United States, Germany, Italy, and Japan oppose the Soviet Union and oppose national liberation, then there will be major changes in the economic world.</p>
<p>In the former situation, the economies of the participating imperialist countries will be relatively damaged, while the national economies of semi-independent countries that are not involved in the war (such as Finland, South America, Turkey, and backward ethnic groups in the Near East and Far East) will generally have the possibility of independent upward development due to the help of the Soviet Union and the weakening of imperialist control. In the latter situation, the entire world's economic world will be severely damaged.</p>
<p>Obviously, the former situation is beneficial to the development of my country's national economy, while the latter will seriously threaten my country's national economy. In order to seek national liberation, we should unite sincerely, gather the strength of the whole people, develop the national economy, build national defense industries, and unite with nations that treat me equally and strive together.</p>
<p>Wang Xiao: I think the connection between the Far East and European situations will be one-sided, not comprehensive; but this is not important to the impact on the world's economic world. Among the economic problems of the countries currently engaged in war, the raw material problem is the first; therefore, the changes in the economic world will be like this: on the one hand, the powers will step up the exploitation of existing colonies, and on the other hand, they will strengthen business ties with the Soviet Union; (the United States cannot be exempt) In this way, the Soviet Union's influence on the world's economic world will relatively increase.</p>
<p>As for China, with the development of the southwest and northwest in the past three years, it has a slight foundation; and it can get the help of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the performance of the economic world is mainly self-reliance and self-renewal, and Soviet aid is secondary.</p>
<p>Liu Xingchu: Can the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East and the war between England and Germany and Italy in Europe be transformed into a connection? Or will they still maintain individual states of war? This will naturally have a great impact on the world's economic trends.</p>
<p>Reaching a connection from an individual state specifically illustrates the development of war from small to large, from simple to more complex; and the world's economy will also move from small problems to great difficulties, from local instability to a major turmoil in the entire world.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to adapt to this difficult and difficult situation in the turbulent economic currents of such an unpredictable world, China's economic world must eliminate the usual fluke mentality of relying on the assistance of foreign economic forces, even if it is not the case, it can only be placed in a secondary position; on the one hand, it should step up the development of the rich resources hidden in the rear and actively build an economic treasure house. Only in this way can we stand on the solid economic foundation of "self-sufficiency" and calmly resist any and all external economic pressures.</p>
<p>Mao Naicheng: Under the connected situation, due to the expansion of the war, the normality of local industry and commerce cannot be maintained due to military needs; inconvenient transportation makes it difficult for goods from various places to be adjusted to each other, so prices will naturally increase seriously. Conversely, if the situation is individual, although prices will not increase sharply, they will gradually increase. It goes without saying that the international exchange market will cause extreme chaos as the scope of the war expands. However, no matter what the situation, China's economic world can only "rely on its own efforts" to adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>Lvhui: Under the connected situation: (A) The economic power of England and the United States will form a unified entity; the maritime blockade will spread all over the world, and commerce will be hindered more and more. (B) During the war, strict blockade and counter-blockade will be implemented. All countries will seek self-sufficiency, control trade, and national economic doctrine will become more prominent. (C) All countries will adopt currency management, control gold and foreign exchange, and those involved in the whirlpool of war will show different degrees of inflation due to the huge military expenditure. The above two questions, B and C, also have the same phenomenon under the individual situation.</p>
<p>Under the individual situation: (A) The dollar group will replace the pound group's position in the world. (B) The economic power of England and Germany in South America will be transferred to the hands of Americans; North and South America may form a large economic unit. (C) The Soviet Union maintains neutrality and strives to develop its own economy, setting itself apart in the midst of the turmoil. (D) Japanese goods may monopolize most of the Southeast Asian market.</p>
<p>Regardless of the individual or connected situation, the import of foreign goods will naturally decrease; my country can take the opportunity to develop industries such as industry, commerce, agriculture, and mining in the interior. It will not only become the backing for the war of resistance, but also lay the foundation for my country's reconstruction after the war. As for the financial aspect, my country's legal tender should be separated from the pound and linked to the dollar when necessary.</p>
<p>Shifu: Under the connected situation, the foreign exchange market has the greatest impact. Secondly, it affects various industries and commerce such as import, export, wholesale, retail, and manufacturing. The impact on the sales industry is earlier than that on the manufacturing industry. Under the individual situation, the time when the sales industry and the manufacturing industry change is the same. The financial world is always on the front line under any situation.</p>
<p>Under the connected situation, China's economic world should first control foreign exchange, crack down on speculation and hoarding, and limit prices in order to ensure the stability of people's lives. Under the individual situation, it should adjust the internal transportation mechanism, control the distribution of raw materials, and study substitutes for foreign raw materials in order to achieve self-sufficiency as an urgent task. As for the utilization of waste, diligence, thrift, and hard work in production, all belong to the responsibilities that the people should fulfill.</p>
<p>Wang Jize: Under a closer connected situation, the most obvious reaction in the economic world is: the pound exchange rate will fall sharply, the international financial market will be chaotic, the strict implementation of controlled economy, the decline of international transportation, the sharp reduction of trade, the drastic change in the supply and demand relationship of commodities, and prices will rise and fall sharply. Under this situation, the United States may give England more assistance and exert more economic pressure on the aggressor.</p>
<p>If the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam are invaded, the impact on the economic world will be the same as the former, but the degree is worse.</p>
<p>These two situations equally warn China: self-reliance is the only way out, and strengthening relations with the Soviet Union is also an urgent matter; the strict controlled economy and the devaluation of foreign currencies in various countries will promote the return of overseas funds; especially the capitalists stranded in Shanghai, due to the chaos in the international situation, they will feel even more deeply that developing the interior is the only way out.</p>
<p>Li Zhantao: If the Far East is connected to the political situation, the world situation will inevitably change; and in the economic aspect, two economic fortresses will be formed with two axes. Among these two fortresses, those who hold sea and air power should have the advantage, because the two major sea and air forces of England and the United States, under close cooperation, must first cut off the supply and cooperation of the enemy countries in the sea and air. If the United States is determined to join the world war, it will be answered by many people. Therefore, we believe that the advantage belongs to the democratic countries; it is not an empty word. Among them, Japan is the most affected. Isolated in a corner of the Far East, its danger is truly unbearable. Under this situation in China, the supply of military supplies will inevitably increase greatly. Under the strategy of adapting to all changes, China can still focus on Japan. It is especially urgent to intensify the economic pressure on Japan. If the European and Far Eastern situations still occupy one side and do not produce a connection effect; then Japan will inevitably step up its invasion of China in order to end the war as soon as possible: to rectify its national strength and seek other plans. On the Chinese side, if England and the United States succumb to Japan, there will be some impact. The only way is to "rely on our own efforts," strive for economic self-sufficiency, and strive to destroy Japan's plan to support the war with war. On the other hand, strengthen Sino-Soviet relations to help China achieve self-sufficiency. As for the European situation, due to the expansion of the territories of Germany and Italy, the supply of economic resources can gradually be obtained from the conquered countries; as a result, the situation of England and the United States will become more difficult. The large amount of gold that the United States currently possesses, if it is not distributed and guided immediately, although it will not be useless, the future loss will be huge, and it can be predicted.</p>

<h3>Financial Commentary (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>— August 17 — Management of Banking Methods</p>
<p>(2) According to the provisions of Article 6, banks should make deposit statements every ten days, etc. The reserve to be deposited seems to be based on the balance of deposits every ten days. The reserve deposited by the bank should increase or decrease at least every ten months due to the increase or decrease of deposits. For the sake of daily receipts and payments, the operating reserve of the bank cannot be unprepared due to the deposit of 20% of the reserve. According to the Bank of China Yearbook 1934-36, the bank's operating reserve is 9-23%. In wartime, according to personal investigations, the percentage of pure cash in the treasury to current deposits is only about 10%. It can be seen that after the implementation of this law, the bank can still freely use as much as 70% of the deposits, so it is necessary to restrict this 70% of the deposits that the bank can freely use with Articles 3 and 4.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the effective implementation of this law, there is no problem in the free China area where the power of the Chinese government can reach. However, the degree to which it can be implemented in Shanghai is quite debatable. Some people believe that the Chinese political power cannot reach Shanghai, and whether it can be implemented is a question; even if it can be implemented, how to implement the provisions of Article 7 by superficially complying but actually opposing: "The Ministry of Finance may send personnel to inspect the bank's account books and inventory at any time..." In fact, although the Chinese political power cannot reach Shanghai, the financial power can still control the Shanghai financial world, so the implementation of Article 2 is not a problem. As for Articles 3 and 4, because the Ministry of Finance cannot establish a suitable agency in Shanghai to carry out inspections, it seems a bit difficult. There are also ways to solve this problem. I personally believe that if the Ministry of Finance is determined to implement it, it can order the central organization of Shanghai's financial institutions (such as the Silver Standard Association, the Money Standard Treasury, etc.) to uphold the painstaking efforts of the authorities and moderately change Articles 2 and 6 to 9 to implement them in a way that suits the environment. How do you know that this law cannot be effective in Shanghai?</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange market has seen sudden changes since the end of July. One is the weakness of the legal tender (fapi) exchange rate, and the other is the decline of the free pound sterling.</p>
<p>The exchange rate of the legal tender, from July 26th to August 10th, fell in a straight line from 6.125 yuan to 5.40625 yuan.  During the week of the 12th to 17th, it rose parabolically from 5.53125 yuan to 5.625 yuan. The downward trend was gradual before August 1st, but rapid after August 1st.  The reason for this is nothing more than speculators taking advantage of the revision of the commercial exchange rate, using the past difference between it and the black market as a basis for speculation. In addition, changes in the situation, such as Japan's intention to attack via Vietnam and the British withdrawal of troops stationed in China, led speculators to make bullish bets. Importers were originally expecting the foreign exchange rate to rise again.  Now, seeing the establishment of a commercial exchange rate of four and a half pence, they believed that even if the foreign exchange rate rose again, it would not exceed the fixed price. Moreover, calculating the U.S. dollar based on four and a half pence and the free pound price only amounted to a little over seven yuan.  Under the inducement of speculators, a large amount of U.S. dollars were settled for foreign rice, kerosene, etc. As a result, the British pound (from 3.875 on July 26th to 3.703125 on August 10th) only increased by about 4%, while the U.S. dollar reached 12%.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in the Shanghai free pound sterling market have always followed the New York free pound price. However, since the British and American agreement to eliminate free pound sterling on July 18th, Shanghai has become the only free market for free pound sterling. Therefore, since July 22nd, it has decoupled from the New York free pound sterling and declined.  The stage from the 24th to the end of July saw a parabolic decline. From August 1st to 10th, the decline was very rapid. Since the 12th, there has been a rebound.  The New York free pound price, on the other hand, has been hovering and rising. On August 15th, it was even the same as the London market price. The following table briefly shows the changes in the free pound sterling in New York and Shanghai:</p>
<p>New York Market   Shanghai Market</p>
<p>July 18th  3.81  3.767</p>
<p>July 20th  3.90  3.812</p>
<p>July 22nd  3.81  3.78</p>
<p>July 26th  3.87  3.763</p>
<p>July 30th  3.82  3.715</p>
<p>August 3rd  3.88  3.63</p>
<p>August 6th  3.95  3.64</p>
<p>August 9th  3.98  3.52</p>
<p>August 14th  4.02  3.525</p>
<p>August 15th  4.025  3.545</p>
<p>August 16th  4.02  3.565</p>
<p>The free pound price in Shanghai fell by about 8% from July 26th to August 10th, which is equivalent to the U.S. dollar rising by about 12%. It can be seen that the weakness of the legal tender exchange rate is closely related to the decline in the free pound price. (End)</p>
<h3>New York Exchange Rate for British Pound Further Reduced</h3>
<p>A New York cable of the 17th stated that the initial opening of the pound sterling exchange rate was good, still at $4.02, but subsequently weakened, once falling to $3.9975. However, the closing price was $4.00, resulting in a further decline of two cents compared to the previous day. The inter-exchange rates of various overseas countries are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>British pound to U.S. dollar  $4.025</p>
<p>U.S. dollar to British pound  $4.00</p>
<p>British pound to Shanghai  4 pence</p>
<p>U.S. dollar to Shanghai  5.70 yuan</p>
<p>British pound to Japanese yen  1 shilling, 2.5 pence</p>
<p>U.S. dollar to Japanese yen  23.48 yuan</p>
<h3>Aluminum Coin Exchange Limit Lowered</h3>
<p>One-cent coins reduced to 10 yuan per bag; five-cent coins reduced to 25 yuan per bag</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city, entrusted by the Bankers' Association, handles the exchange of aluminum coins for various banks and firms, as detailed in this newspaper. It is now reported that the Committee, in order to facilitate small-amount exchanges and promote circulation, has changed the previous bag size of ten thousand five-cent aluminum coins and five thousand five-cent aluminum coins (i.e., 500 yuan and 250 yuan) to five hundred coins (i.e., 25 yuan) per bag. The previous bag size of ten thousand one-cent aluminum coins (i.e., 100 yuan) has been changed to one thousand coins (i.e., 10 yuan) per bag. Notices have been sent to various banks and firms, encouraging them to use them as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Red Sugar Up 5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat, with minimal fluctuations. The association's open market price for current 24 coarse white sugar was 72 yuan for this warehouse and 71.6 yuan for other warehouses, with no changes. Transshipment cargo was 56.4 yuan, down 1 jiao. Dutch cotton white KD mark was 71.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 59.5 yuan to 59.7 yuan, down 3 jiao. Taikoo car white B mark remained at 75 yuan. HX mark was 71.7 yuan. H mark car red sugar was 58.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. The prices of sugar and crystal sugar from our factory remained unchanged. There were no transactions in domestic sugar.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Seafood Rises Across the Board</h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo seafood ports were blockaded, shipping has been suspended, making transportation impossible, and cutting off the source. Consequently, there is a shortage of current goods, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Market prices have risen across the board. Currently, jellyfish skin is selling for 70 yuan, jellyfish heads for 65 yuan, dried shrimp for 110 yuan, Zhoushan dried shrimp for 160 yuan, Yantai dried shrimp (good quality) for 140 yuan, Ningbo yellow croaker maw pieces for 460 yuan, with king pieces sold out. Light Ningbo fish maw is 290 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Black Melon Seeds Open at Higher Prices</h3>
<p>Several dozen packages of new black melon seeds have recently arrived. Due to high production costs, prices have not loosened. Therefore, the opening price is quite firm. Xu Kui seeds open at 92 yuan, and the next best at 88 yuan. Existing stocks of old goods are also scarce, showing a slight increase. New Tongcheng seeds open at 93 yuan, and Linhuaiguan seeds at 90 yuan, totaling over twenty packages.</p>
<h3>Dried Bamboo Shoots Rise</h3>
<p>Arrivals of dried bamboo shoots have remained scarce recently. Therefore, market prices have continued to rise. Yesterday, the market price for premium winter slices from Shangzhuang was 320 yuan, and the ordinary price was 280 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Hunan Lotus Seeds Arrive</h3>
<p>Thirty pieces of new Benhu lotus seeds have just arrived. They were opened for sale yesterday, with a price of 210 yuan. Air-conditioned goods are selling for a higher price of 200 yuan, the next best at 195 yuan, down to 190 yuan.</p>

<h3>On Fasting and Abstinence</h3>
<p>The practice of fasting and abstinence has existed since ancient times and continues to this day. However, people today only know about fasting and abstinence but do not understand its true meaning, merely equating it with not eating meat or fish, which misses the point! The ancients emphasized the heart in fasting and abstinence, while people today emphasize outward appearances. The Book of Rites says, "During the seven days of intense fasting or the three days of fasting, one should feel as if one sees something and be filled with respect as if one hears something." This is because their hearts are pure and empty, capable of communicating with spirits and penetrating the underworld. How can it be compared to those who abstain from meat today, calling it fasting and abstinence, but in reality not knowing what to abstain from or what to be wary of? Fasting means taking on the meaning of solemnity and decorum, aligning the misalignment to achieve alignment, so that the heart is clear and without blemish, and then one is not ashamed of the meaning of the word "fasting." Abstinence means taking on the meaning of caution, reflecting on oneself, and ensuring there is no inner guilt, so that the heart is solemn and not lax, and then the meaning of the word "abstinence" is not hindered. Therefore, intense fasting is inward, and ordinary fasting is outward, so that the person being sacrificed to and our hearts are subtly connected. Can those who fast and abstain today be like this? Fasting and abstinence is not about not eating meat, but not eating meat is not necessarily fasting and abstinence. The Village Records state that Confucius always changed his diet when fasting, and Zhu Xi commented, "Changing the diet means not drinking alcohol and not eating meat." If those who fast all abstain from meat, why single out Confucius as different? This shows that in ancient times, fasting and abstinence may have included eating meat, but Confucius alone changed his diet, so he had sincerity as if he were present. However, Confucius' intention in changing his diet was still to maintain clarity in himself, not daring to allow greasy, fishy, or rancid things to mix within him.</p>

<h3>Tea Talk</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The Status of Tea: Tea is one of the seven necessities of life, and its position is quite important. "One thinks of food when hungry, and of tea when thirsty," it is something people cannot lack. When a distinguished guest arrives, other things can be omitted, but at least this cup of tea should be respectfully offered. Tea leaves used to be a major export from our country, generating considerable profit each year. However, the methods of manufacturing and roasting have remained unchanged, without improvements. As a result, various countries in the East and West have been studying tea tree planting and the latest roasting methods to achieve self-sufficiency, leading to a gradual decline in our country's export volume. This is very regrettable!</p>
<p>Types of Tea: There are many types of tea, broadly divided into red and green teas, consumed according to individual preferences. The more famous and valuable teas include Yunnan Pu'er, Anhui Qimen, and jasmine tea. However, the West Lake Longjing tea from my hometown is famous far and wide. However, genuine Longjing tea is produced only in a few acres of land on Lion Peak, and the output is not large. In the past, apart from tributes to the imperial court and small amounts treasured by nearby temples for the high officials, very little remained. Although tea shops use Longjing to attract customers, most are selling imitations. Who can tell the real from the fake? It is said that genuine Lion Peak tea, after being steeped in boiling water, has leaves standing like spears. Moreover, to make such good tea, one must use famous spring water. This makes the color emerald green and lovely, and the taste fragrant, pure, and mellow. Hence, the Hangzhou saying, "Longjing bud tea with Tiger Spring water."</p>
<p>Uses of Tea: Drinking tea after a meal can aid digestion and cleanse the stomach. During this hot summer, keeping snow at home and using snow water to brew tea is an excellent way to cool off. According to popular belief, "Tea leaves have a hundred benefits, especially for the eyes." I am ashamed to say that I have no medical experience and dare not make a definitive judgment, but many people use steeped tea leaves to wash their eyes in the morning, saying that it can improve eyesight. Many families in my hometown like to dry used tea leaves in the sun and use them to stuff pillows, claiming it has a great effect on clearing the mind.</p>
<p>Tea Rhymes: Lu Tong's seven bowls that generated wind has been celebrated as a beautiful tale throughout history, but in reality, seven bowls of tea is too much. There is something called "immortal tea," made by simmering top-quality tea with aromatics over a gentle fire, allowing the aroma and flavor of the tea to meld together. Then, one sips it slowly, leaving a lingering fragrance on the tongue. This is only possible for those who are leisured and have a unique passion. There is also a type of "daughter tea," said to be made by young women in their teens, who pick tender buds and keep them in cloth bags close to their bodies to dry. When they marry, they take it to their husband's family to entertain guests, which is quite romantic. After a fresh rain, in the afternoon courtyard, when the oppressive heat has subsided and a cool breeze gradually arrives, playing chess with two or three close friends, as graceful maids bring fragrant tea to serve the guests, is an elegant and delightful scene, like unfolding a painting. How can people in times of turmoil enjoy such blessings?</p>
<h3>On Improving Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Bao Xing</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Jin Xiawen's "Proposal for Improving Women's Clothing," published in the previous issue of this magazine, I cannot help but express my astonishment.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the clothes of women in our country were indeed long skirts and long sleeves, but that was only in ancient times. The clothing of women today is indeed short sleeves and knee-length trousers, but there are also factual conditions that have led to this trend. To compare long skirts and long sleeves with bare arms and legs, one must also consider the environment of the past and present. To require women today to cover their elbows and knees in clothing is just as impossible and unnecessary as requiring women in ancient China to bare their arms and legs.</p>
<p>What surprised me most in "Proposal for Improving Women's Clothing" is that Mr. Jin actually believes that clothing is related to "the uprightness of one's character" and "the status of one's family." "Family status" is a relic from decades ago. As for using clothing as a standard for judging the uprightness of one's character, only snobbish Shanghai people hold this view, which is undoubtedly wrong. Mr. Jin's views are utterly feudal and absurd!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in principle, I very much agree with the improvement of women's current clothing. However, for reasons of convenience of movement, I think there is no need to cover elbows and knees, and clothing with curves is perfectly acceptable. In my eyes, women's current clothing is not as unacceptable as Mr. Jin's article suggests. However, further improvement is indeed needed.</p>
<p>It is difficult to think of concrete improvement methods at this time. This is a big problem that requires widespread discussion. Some small suggestions here are: changing the size is secondary; the more important thing should be improvements in style.</p>
<h3>Guangxi's "Rice Noodles"</h3>
<p>Rice noodles are the most common snack in Guangxi Province. First, rice and water are ground into a thick rice paste and steamed in a pot. Then, it is placed in a press to squeeze out thin strips of rice noodles. There are two types of rice noodles in Guangxi: Guilin rice noodles and Liuzhou rice noodles.</p>
<p>In Guilin, rice noodles have become the main food besides "rice." From high-ranking officials to porters, everyone likes to eat them, so they are very common. There are more rice noodle shops than restaurants. You can find one or two on every corner. In addition, there are rice noodle vendors who do business on the streets from day to night.</p>
<p>Guilin rice noodles are about the same thickness as Shanghai noodles. After being squeezed out of the press, they are shaped into egg-sized balls and delivered to the rice noodle shops. The shops have various barbecued and braised meats. After the customer orders what they want, the shop assistant prepares the dish. First, about six balls of rice noodles are placed in a copper ladle with many small holes and immersed in boiling water for about five minutes. Then, they are removed and the water is drained. They are poured into a bowl, and the customer's specified toppings are placed on top of the rice noodles. Some hot oil and braising sauce are drizzled on top, and some fried beans are added. In the past, it was 1 jiao per bowl, but now it has increased to 2 jiao. People in Guangxi like to eat chili peppers, so minced garlic and chili peppers are provided free of charge in the rice noodle shops.</p>
<p>In addition, Guilin also has a special dish called "horse meat rice noodles," which is a side business of the rice noodle shops. Every year, from autumn to early winter, the rice noodle shops post large red paper strips with the words "Horse Meat Rice Noodles Available." As a result, the number of customers increases several times compared to usual. Horse meat rice noodles are ordinary rice noodles served with clear broth and thin slices of fresh, tender horse meat. Its characteristic is that it is delicious but the portion is small, costing 5 fen per bowl, which is finished in two mouthfuls. However, the usual way to eat it is to eat at least ten bowls. So, after the first bowl is ordered and served, bowls are sent one after another until the diner says they don't want any more. Many people don't eat rice and go to eat horse meat rice noodles specifically, eating more than thirty bowls is very common.</p>
<p>Liuzhou rice noodles are thinner than Guilin rice noodles. Rice noodle shops are everywhere in Liuzhou. Locals eat rice noodles for breakfast. Although they are also sold after noon, business is far less brisk than in the morning.</p>
<p>The rice noodles in the morning are the freshest. Fresh slices of meat, fish, pork kidney, and pork liver are immersed in boiling water for about two or three minutes and removed, making them fresh and tender. They are poured over the rice noodles, and clear broth, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, and chili oil are added, and then they are ready to eat. The price is not expensive, ranging from 1 jiao to 2. People in Liuzhou love to eat rice noodles, just like people in Guangdong love to go to tea houses. Every morning, they must go to the rice noodle shop. Even people from other places who go to Liuzhou must try them.</p>

<h3>One-Week Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Beans are generally loved by most people and are rich in valuable vitamin B. After the season for fresh broad beans has passed, old broad beans can be dried and kept at home for future use. Common ways to cook old broad beans include boiling them with the shells (commonly known as "crispy beans") or shelling them and adding finely chopped pickled mustard greens to make a bean curd soup. Another method is to shell them and boil them until crispy, then add shredded pickled mustard greens or chopped scallions and salt. You don't need to add soy sauce; you can eat it as a bean curd salad. If you want to be more particular and make it vegetarian, then finely chop fresh meat and stir-fry it with the bean curd salad. The flavor will naturally be even more delicious.</p>
<h3>Record of the 2000-Year-Old Banquet</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Zhonghu, a respected elder in academic circles, is 67 years old but has a great spirit and is very fit. He is nicknamed the "Earth Immortal" and belongs to the Xingyi Society. A celebration was held for him at the Gongdelin. I received a letter from Mr. Zhuang Tongbai informing me of the event, and I also participated. There were 40 attendees that day, mostly of advanced age. Mr. Tongbai's respected uncle, Mr. Zhongwei, at 86 years old, was still able to write in the style of Ouyang Xun and Chu Suiliang on the guest book. Other attendees included Fan Weiqing, 76 years old; Gao Yuhui, 74 years old; Zhu Bianjun, 71 years old; and Hou Baosan and Cai Songru, both 69 years old. Ding Zhonglao and Mei Xingyou were the same age as Ding Zhonghu, Kuang Zhongmou was 64 years old, Shi Wenlan was 63 years old, and Zou Songdan was 62 years old, and Feng Xucheng, was 60 years old. The rest were under 60 years old, totaling 2,073 years old. Tongbai smiled and said, "This can be called the 2000-year-old banquet." Moreover, among the elders present, some had plump faces and a head full of white hair, some had an appetite as usual with teeth that didn't shake, some spoke eloquently like a rushing river, and some sat upright without slouching. So I asked about their methods of maintaining health. Summing up the elders' advice, they mostly avoided sensuality and troubles, did not force themselves to eat, ate more vegetables, and less fish and meat. Ding Zhonglao even said that Hitler also eliminated greasy and stimulating foods, believing that this was the only way to maintain health. Zhonglao wrote a book called "Food and Early Aging," which discusses this in detail. On that day, I sat next to Tian Jian and talked about the turmoil and chaos, and couldn't help but sigh. However, one thing was very comforting: he had a talented student, Mr. Yang Shilang, whose landscape paintings directly entered the hall of Song and Yuan masters. He presented me with a painting titled "Stone Period Books," depicting a long embankment between pine forests and cliffs, with a man walking with a staff and empty smoke and water on either side. After appreciating it, it filled me with a distant feeling. Tian Jian said that Youlang planned to publicly exhibit his works in the coming days, and would invite me again to feast my eyes. Afterwards, Zhou Nanzhao, Zhu Jianqiu, Ma Gongyu, Qian Huafo, and others arrived. Some had known each other for years, and some had met and interacted frequently. After greetings, we shared a glass of wine together. It was truly a rare and enjoyable event in recent years.</p>
<h3>The "Trading House" of Changsha</h3>
<p>— Hai Zhiqi</p>
<p>The two words "trading house", in the ears of us Jiangnan people, is always a shop that sells things. However, until I arrived in Changsha the year before last, I realized that my guess was completely wrong. The so-called trading house is just another name for "hotel", "hostel" or "inn".</p>
<p>As the war spread and the war zone expanded, refugees, like waves, were pushed into the interior. The interior flourished, especially the "food shops" and "trading houses," which were often full. The trading houses of Changsha can be praised for being inexpensive in terms of economics, but good value is out of the question. These trading houses mostly occupy a larger house, because the rent there is cheap and expenses are low. Each trading house has more than ten rooms, each room with two or three beds, and the light in the inn is generally not sufficient, but it is enough to solve the problem of accommodation. The refugees who live here also feel that it is a haven of peace.</p>
<p>The trading houses do not provide luggage, and each traveler must bring their own bedding, etc. Single travelers also have to share a room with people they don't know. There are also tea servers, but very few, and they only serve tea and do not interfere with anything else. The fees are charged per person and are so low that people can hardly believe it. They provide accommodation and tea every day, as well as three meals (not charged separately per guest. A table must be full of eight people before you can eat). At the cheapest time, it only costs four jiao per person per day, and later it rose to six or seven jiao. Some refugees want to taste chili peppers at every meal, and they are used to eating them, which is quite flavorful...</p>
<p>Seeing the abnormal development of Shanghai hotels, I feel the need to write about the trading houses of Changsha as a reference and hope that Shanghai will have truly popular, convenient hotels for travelers.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Noisy Night</h3>
<p>— Suffering the Same</p>
<p>A few days ago, A-Chang, who runs a fruit stall, and some of his brothers suddenly started a fundraising campaign. On the front of a notebook made of rough yellow paper, they unevenly wrote the words "Donation for the Ritual of the ×× Neighborhood" and went from house to house, door to door.</p>
<p>"Mrs. ×, donate five yuan!" A-Chang's direct tone, as usual.</p>
<p>"What's this all about? Such a grand gesture..."</p>
<p>"Once a year, seeking peace and prosperity... a donation for the ritual!"</p>
<p>"Oh!... One yuan then... You are all so enthusiastic!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!" The people of the entire alleyway acted as almsgivers and offered blessings.</p>
<p>After a whole day of busy work, A-Chang and his brothers' fundraising work came to a successful conclusion. The people of the entire alleyway began to know that the ritual of the neighborhood would be held again, but the date was still being discussed by A-Chang and his brothers. They just showed excitement and joy...</p>
<p>It must have been Saturday morning when the front and back of our alleyway began to be decorated with paper crafts. Straw ropes connected paper clothes, paper figures, and paper hats, giving the people living in the alleyway another kind of feeling, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p>
<p>The children were especially happy, pointing east and west in strings, running around non-stop, a noisy bunch.</p>
<p>A table of sacrificial offerings was set up in front of the tiger stove in the east of the alleyway. The offerings made people remember that they were not as abundant as last year. After breakfast, six monks in yellow robes were seen sitting around the sacrificial table, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, chanting scriptures and worshiping. They were doing it on our behalf.</p>
<p>The scene at night was even more lively.</p>
<p>Outside the original sacrificial table, in the front yard of the snack shop at the end of the alleyway, a temporary wooden platform was built. The snack shop temporarily stopped business, and the parlor was used as the backstage. In front of the short table on the stage hung a large red embroidered tablecloth, the four gold-embroidered characters "×× Stage" especially catching people's eyes. "There's a play." This news spread throughout our neighborhood in no time.</p>
<p>When it started, this long alleyway was already densely lined with countless benches. The audience was all our neighbors, men, women, old and young, a mixed crowd. Everyone was dazzled, watching the performance on the temporary stage.</p>
<p>The Shaoxing opera troupe was not as quiet as a civil drama. The full set of gongs, drums, etc., when mixed together, was really annoying! But among the audience, some were not people from Shaoxing, but they were all patient enough to listen to the performance. Applause, cheers... even echoed around the beams!</p>
<p>This bustling and lively scene continued until four o'clock in the morning of the next day. The paper crafts were burned, the sacrificial offerings were removed, and the audience dispersed with tired bodies. The "Peaceful Public Ritual" was finally a complete "merit completion."</p>
<p>The people who wanted to sleep on this day were the first to start cursing:</p>
<p>"I haven't closed my eyes all night! What a sin! What a sin!..."</p>
<p>"Such a grand gesture, and still enjoying themselves in poverty!..."</p>
<p>Naturally, A-Chang was considered the most annoying one, but when he told everyone, in the afternoon, rubbing his eyelids and saying "exhausting" with a bittersweet voice, that the economics of this ritual exceeded the budget, his small fruit stall had actually lost forty yuan this time.</p>
<p>"It's really a waste of energy and money!" Everyone was a little depressed.</p>
<h3>Life and Career</h3>
<p>— Qian Fei</p>
<p>On the surface, life and career seem to be closely related. Everyone born into this world has a desire to survive. Because career is a factor in maintaining life, everyone must have a career; those without a career try every means to find one. However, strictly speaking, life is life, and career is career, and they should not be mixed together and discussed as one. A so-called career should contribute to society and benefit the people to be called a career. If one only cares about personal life satisfaction and does not hesitate to do things that harm the public interest, can this be called a career?</p>
<p>We often hear people say, "How great is this person's career!" In fact, careers are not really great or not great, because a career should be great. A career that is not great has no value. If it does not reach the value of a career, how can it be called a career?</p>
<p>A person who wants to live and seek a career should pay attention to the value of the career. If a career has value, life has meaning, and both the individual and others will benefit. If a career has no value, although personal life can be worry-free, or even better than others, such people are silkworms in society and harmful horses in the crowd. Such people are as good as dead even when alive, abandoning the true meaning of life!</p>
<p>Those who have mistaken the purpose of seeking life should turn back as soon as possible. Look at the many people who sacrifice for their careers. Once their careers are successful, they have long put their personal lives out of their minds. No matter how hard life is, they work hard at their careers. Why don't they find a so-called career that can make life more comfortable? They are for the life of the public! The career they are engaged in can make everyone's life comfortable. As the saying goes, "It is better to enjoy happiness with everyone than to enjoy it alone." They know that only by living a comfortable life together can there be true happiness and the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>A career is the guarantee of life. A career that cannot guarantee life cannot last long. Those who understand the big picture will never care about life before their career is successful and life is guaranteed. They must devote themselves to a career that guarantees life. Once the career is stable, then life can be stable, permanent, and happy. However, I am not saying that people should ignore their lives altogether, because striving for a career is actually striving for life. There are many people in the world who do great things who, in an environment where they cannot take care of their private lives, will never go against reality, abandon their careers, and take care of their lives. If this law is violated, the career will never succeed. Although life may be stable temporarily, it is like a boat without a rudder, losing its guarantee and in danger of capsizing at any time.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Bad News</p>
<p>When I returned to his apartment, it was already eleven o'clock. I asked Shi Gui, and there was no news of Hawthorne. Ni Jinshou had called, also asking if Hawthorne had returned to the apartment.</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Strange, he just talked to Hawthorne on the phone, why is he asking about him again?" I asked Shi Gui again, "When did Detective Ni call?"</p>
<p>Shi Gui replied, "About fifteen minutes ago." He seemed a little anxious because of the expression on my face.</p>
<p>I asked again, "Did he say anything?"</p>
<p>Shi Gui shook his head and said, "No, as soon as he heard me say that Mr. Hawthorne hadn't returned, he hung up the phone immediately, as if he was very anxious. Mr. Bao, where did you part ways with him? Could something have happened?"</p>
<p>I didn't have time to tell Shi Gui the details, so I rushed to the telephone and called the police station to talk to Ni Jinshou. The response I got immediately made my nerves tense.</p>
<p>The operator at the police station replied, "Detective Ni has gone out, probably less than half an hour ago."</p>
<p>I asked again, "Did he say where he was going?"</p>
<p>"No, he left in a hurry, and he was a little strange."</p>
<p>"Strange? How strange?"</p>
<p>"He seemed to be talking to Mr. Hawthorne, and he talked for quite a while. But the conversation didn't come to a conclusion, and Detective Ni suddenly took his gun and went out."</p>
<p>I felt my heart beating very fast and my breathing quickening. But I still maintained my conversation.</p>
<p>"Explain it more clearly. How do you mean it didn't come to a conclusion?"</p>
<p>"Detective Ni repeatedly said 'hello' into the receiver, as if Mr. Hawthorne's phone suddenly went dead. Detective Ni's face was very tense, so he hung up the receiver, hurriedly put a gun in his pocket, and rushed out." (80)</p>
<h3>Layoffs · Salary Cuts</h3>
<p>— Ren Ming</p>
<p>Currently, many shops, under the pretext of sluggish business, are saying they need to drastically reduce expenses and are preparing to lay off employees and cut salaries.</p>
<p>This is unavoidable. Prices have risen so high that they can't rise any further, and most people lack purchasing power. People are not rushing to buy goods that can be dispensed with, so of course business will not be good.</p>
<p>Shareholders and managers should not be too selfish. When business was booming, they expanded their operations and added many employees, making a lot of money, but the ordinary employees benefited very little. Now that business is bad, they should also take care of the livelihood of their colleagues and try their best to maintain it within the possible range.</p>
<p>Whether they are capitalists or ordinary employees, they should not spend money arbitrarily when they have money to earn. If they can save a little, they will suffer less when they encounter store closures, losses, salary cuts, and unemployment!</p>
